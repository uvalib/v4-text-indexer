      <field name="fulltext">ERNEST: THE RULE OF RIGHT. INTRODUCTION. I Poesy, thou wert once the true soul-kingâ Glowing with godly aims and energies; The spirits' inmost spirit, wakening Man's dull heartstrings to heavenly harmonies; Cheering what else were cold, and quickening Faintness with the warm blood of enterprise; They told me thou wert lofty, good and free; And truly I believed, and soothly worshipped thee. II And the weird charactery thou hast writ, And all the soul of thy aspiring song I took it to my heart and cherished it, Studying deep, and meditating long. Alas! the weakness of unworldly wit! The fond believer's faith! Thy fairy throng Belie the Truth, and are not what they seemâ I woke, and they were fledâa fair fantastic dream. III And there I stood, like the lone Laplander, When once his Northern glamouring lights are goneâ Shuddering at the aspect, cold and drear, Of the unlovely land he looks uponâ Yesâthou too hast a flame such as might cheer With light and warmth earth's gloomiest region: Virtue most gracious, might Electricalâ But in wild lightning gleams still dost thou spend it all. IV What! was thy childhood manlier than is Thy full and manlike age? There was a time, (Alas! how distant and dim-seen from this) When he, the loving high-souled bard sublime Made of thy breathings a harmonial bliss, Creating order from a waste of crime; And then thy spirit was the breath of life To man's society; composing it from strife, V Charming the soul of froward savageness To civil union and fair ordinance. Such in old Time thou wert, and now no less If thy good grace were in good governance; If only thy true drift thou wouldst redress From idle aims and silly dalliance: From their brain-sickly fond imaginings Who call thy glories down on conquerors and kings. VI And Oh! as many such have prayed to thee, And thou hast condescended to their prayer; So hear me now, thy latest votary, And rise with me to realms of purer air: And shed thy lustre on the majesty Of a great Hero, great beyond compare; The sovereign peopleâariseâredress his wrongâ Worthiest, tho' yet unsungâof thy heroic song. VII But wherefore rake the rotten historic heap To find a soul? their glory doth but shine Foully, as charnel filth; noâlet them sleep In darkness, only take them not for thineâ 'Tis from another fount, holy and deep, Thou must draw forth thy effluence divine; Nor look for life among the dead, who then When living, cared nor did aught for their fellow-men; VIII And how shall good spring from their memories? Oh no! but we must take another aim Unto another end: 'Tis from the skies Thou shalt achieve an everlasting flame That fable old truly to realize. And with a fiery spirit shalt thou frame To wondrous energy man's loutish clayâ And spread the Truth abroad till its dawn grow to day. IX E'en as God erst of His Almighty will Breathed thro' His prophets the Poetic fire; Be thou the handmaid of Religion still, And flash a holy lightning from thy lyre: So thy high destiny thou shalt fulfilâ For therefore with thy love doth God inspire Each state of man, savage and skilled, that so Uprising with thy wings, to greatness he may grow. X Yes, Poesy, I know thee, and thou art Faith's harbinger, thy quickening rays unrol: The self-wrapt blossom, the hard natural heart, Swelling it to a spiritual soulâ Ah, wherefore are ye two so long apart? But now, e'en now at last into one whole Be blent each wild poetic melody, Full streaming in a deep religious harmony. XI Making one Faith of many phantasies, Of many flaunting colors one true lightâ One soul of many sensibilities, One high-throned reason to rule all aright. That peace and joy may crown man's destinies, And glory be to God on Heaven's height: A righteous consummationâhence along Fair Poesy, and breathe thy spirit thro' my song. BOOK I. The storm is in the skyâdrear is the nightâ Distinction lost in darknessâstarless all Heaven and earth all gloomâdismal the airâ The wild winds wolf-like howling:âRuin is rife Havock and blinding uproarâWoe to thee, Thou lonely wayfarer, in such a timeâ A dreary timeâforwardâbestir theeâelse doubt Cowers darkling, and then sinks in deepest slough Despondentâfor not only is outward sense Lost 'neath the dark night-pallâbut e'en the heart Steeped in the like sad shadows, is subdued To the gloom surrounding it. Then shrinks the spirit, Like a chill fog, back to its fen. On slumps The tramper, with storm-blinded downcast eye, Cumbered, not clad, with heavy rain-soaked clothes; And as he turns his dripping head askance, Looking for comfort where no comfort is, E'en in the void and waste of wretchednessâ And feels himself alone, where save himself None feels beside; unkindly all! then each Stock and each stone he envies, for they feel NothingââWould I were stubborn senseless tooâ Weather and rough roads, so I'd weary out Your spiteâbetter the clay that cleaves to the feet Than the mired man that tramples it.â So fared That night, a lonely wanderer thro' the waste, Frederick Hess, weary and woe begone, And struggling hard to overmatch the storm. But grief and mirth are bastards of the soul O'erweening slips of idlenessâweedsâno moreâ Self springing here and there from the rank mind: The wanton overshoots of that self-same Will, whose right offspring and determinate end, When wedded to its true belonging faith, Are calmness, strength, surety, and happiness. Away then, both alike:âthe master mind But slights ye, and with forward will confounds Your weakling fanciesâthat is Truth confestâ And he, the wanderer, truly felt it soâ âHenceforth do I forswear itâthis child's mood. For I've a feat to do, and that same feat Must be done strongly, or fail utterly: For whoso begins faintly so forebodes His endâfrom that half life a whole weak death, With blood curdled to whey. Ahâwomanish! Nayâwoman is far 'bove such mannishness. Howe'erâmy heartâbeat not so bashfullyâ But rouse theeâwhy should'st not. I trust in God, Then wherefore fear? He spoke; and as good cheer Is oftentimes the herald of good chance, So was it then; for starlike, far in the gloom, Suddenly showed itself a cottage light Coyly, its gleam now twinkling and now lostâ Yet, tho' faint flickering, to his weary sense Livelier than the sun when liveliest, And welcomer: long had he looked for it: But the long grievousness of that delay Was lost in gladness of the sudden sight When first he saw itâfor it spoke to his heart Of fond hearth-faces and home-happiness: Dear alwaysâdearest to his plight forlorn. He peered withinâthere, by the fire, she sate Plying her needleâwatching her boys playâ Rocking to sleep her cradle's fretful cry, Or listening to the Gospel, slowly spelt By her girl, yet so sped home, no less, to the heart; With each word weighed in due deliberate wise; So best, for unlearned faith. Meantime the blaze Fitfully streaming from the high-piled heap Kist each coy nookâenriching the walls round With golden gladness. The old oaken chest Was softened to a smiling radiance; Crackled the logs, and the huge chimney growled, As some churl mastiff o'er his mumbled bones, Its gruff complacence: the familiar cat Purred at her ease, basking with dozy eyes, In the homely sunshineâall is happy here, As Happiness herself had lit the lamp And shed her soul aroundâall but the wifeâ Yet sure she, too, compassed with ambient bliss, Should feel its boon, and render up her heart To that soft influenceâe'en as her mate Takes sorrow home, and mirrors on his soul The sad surrounding skyâreason 'twere thusâ Prompture there is and argument enough In such suggestion. Nature wills it so: But thought must ever play its thralling tricks Over our sense: marring its gushy joys With a considerate grief; looking away From bliss before her spread, and wilfully Forth hastening to meet each threaten'd ill. Herein the witless soul, the very child, Whose heart is open like a flower in the sun To every wooing kindly influence. Taking the milk of nature soothly, as a babe, Is wiser than the wisdom of the sage, Studious oft times, but to sad prejudice: Self-crossed with care: subliming his sound food To curious vapour, and thence distilling tears: Curst Alchemyâe'en as that loving wife Misdeemed the happiness that wooed her there In wholesome certainty and shapes of sense, And sent her moody speculation forth To dwell in the dark with goblins; till, in words Most woful, she gave utterance to her thoughts:â Where art thou, my husband? And did'st thou not say That sure I should see thee Ere fall of the day? And the sun is far down, And high up is the moon, And thou wide asunder; Oh, turn to me soon. Go tell me, my Lucy, Look forth in the air: Is the storm yet abroad? Is the night foul or fair? âAlas! dearest mother, I looked but e'en now; And yet the night vapour Is chill on my brow: And I marked, when I told thee, Thy sighs and thy pain: And why should I make thee Such sorrow again?â Ah! well hast thou said, child, And so had I thought; But we who feel sorely Bethink us of nought, And thou, darling baby, How sadly would show My widow'd dark weeds With thine, white as snow! Oh! grief is not only In coldness and hateâ Love, too, hath its anguishâ And haply as great. But list thereâah, vainly, Would I hearken or see; My heart beats so wildlyâ Oh, Heaven, it is he. The latch was raised, he entered, and they met: But who shall lay such load upon his pen To write their meeting? Happy they who feel, And all as irksome he who strives to tell. And they are breathing warm, soul into soul, Confused in melting joy; locked in embrace, As though they held their pledge of happiness By that dear clasp. Where is it fled, the woe That late overwhelmed them? Nay, what heightens bliss, Call it not woeâfor our ills do but wait Upon our blessings, as the Ethiop Swart Eunuch on the Sultan's sunless fair, Making Grace goodlier. Praised be Providence For such distinction of our darksome life With gleams of joy and light constellative. E'en so that loving pair were then made glad From out their gloom: there stood the man, fordone With toil, rain-reeking: from her eager embrace Shrinking, bedraggled as he wasâwhile yet His heart up-yearned to meet it. âStay, dear soul, Thy welcome is too warmâbefits thee not, Nursed as thou art in household tenderness, To catch my damp contagion. So, one kiss, Then to thy chairâfor much have I to tellâ Would 'twere a traveller's tale; but, oh, it stormed, As it would storm the mountains from their stand, And drive the stars ablastâbut I am here, Here and with theeâthis evens all my odds; Out of a thousand griefs making one joy. Why not? black billets theseâbut yet they burn To a blaze. He took his wonted hearth-side seat: But she, his watchful wife, for his health's sake Forbad him. Nay, five minutes, 'tis soon done, To put thy damp dress off, and clothe thee afresh In comfort; therefore, having 'scaped one ill, To risk another, and yet worseâah, no. All is set forthâthy fire alight for thee. Go then, refresh thee, and so hither again To our warm welcome. So, as the wife said, The husband didâhe strode wearily up, Marking with miry blotch each several step, To his bright bed-room. His broad frame he bared, And doffed the clinging dankness of his clothes; Next with the freshening water washed away His cloggy faintness and foul weathery stains: Then like the eagle plumed to a new youth Came forth, cleanly arrayed, lightsome of step And mood: as gladly toward him uprose His conjugal dear comfort, beaming forth From her countenance the fire's reflected light, And yet a kinder radiance of her own, Lit from the lamp of love. Then overflowed Husbandlike rapture, joy in disarray, Tearful endearment trueâlong ere he freed His wife from the soft bond of his embrace, And turned away, there to distribute his love Where 'twas next due; redoubling kiss on kiss 'Mong prattling lips: asking and answering All in one breath. Their mother left them awhile (For womanhood is fitful, soon upstirred) And knelt at her bedside, by her heart gush O'erpowered, in deep pensiveness of prayer: So her thanksgiving doubled to her heart The blessing that it owned: then briskly uprose For his meal's needâsince not, till now, had she spread Her board, as loath his presence to presume, And rue him so, being absent, all the more. For disappointment with a writhing scourge Scores out the account of hope: and love forebodes Gloomilyâyes, where light is liveliest, Shadows are darkestâ But now, all being ripe; And fearful, wishful, hope substanced in bliss, Her nimble spirit thro' each finger ran O'erquickening the delay; serving each need Fairylike, with her swift and noiseless skillâ The work true to the will. What tho' the fiend Of gluttony bestrode not their slight board With lubbard belly? Tho' no sweltering spilth Were there to drown the spiritual soul, And choke the drawling utteranceâno lamps Drunk with their oily swill, flaring away Above the guests with spendthrift revelry; Yet had they that one need for happinessâ Home-comfort. Smoothed awhile were elder brows, And childish faces gazed upon the fire, E'en as its fascination held them fast, Smiling they knew not whyâas the young smile, And the old sigh. Anon the kettle breathed Its invitation to familiar rites: First softly murmuring with rise and fall And pause, as who preludes before he plays: Then blowing a more moody and deeper blast As summoning its strength; till, in full heat, Brooking no more delay, it boils amain, Impatient, bellowing from the fiery goad. The housewife heard, and from its flow half-filled A silver vessel, wrought with costly skill, Her grandsire's bridal gift, memorial Of wealthier circumstance, and happier years, Hopeless againâfor youth's fresh joyance dies, And dead revives not; but instead of it The silver and the gold of eldership With heartless mockery of leaf, tendril and grape, Must stand for flowers and fruit: the sudden steam Dimmed the bright vase; then in each cup she poured The purifying influence, and from its nook A chest produced, whose odorous potency Within, o'erpowered its cedar scent without. Its lid disclosed, the fragrant spirit out flew With smell betokening tasteâcharily next She doled the precious herbage, spoon by spoon, And poured thereon the penetrative stream Once and againâthen a short pause, by talk And mirth made shorter, ere she 'gan dispense Her gracious drink: that gracious drink transfused Into its cognate cups of far cathay And blended there with cream, soft temperature, Its virgin harshness lost in a gentler kind Soothing the tasteânor needed urgency To strain the willing welcome; as when erst Mad revelry, with stress that more beseems The hangman with his rope, or poisoned cup, Would force its swilling potion down the throat Of the abject drunkardâ Merriment was rife 'Neath that low thatch: the minutes winged their way Like a glad dreamâsportive as fairy sprites Dancing at eve with feet that but provoke The springy grass to rise against their tread, And no trace left. Their joy blazed as a star, Needing nought else to feed it: from each brow To each reflected, glancing eye from eye, Well did it lustre every nook of the room, Fairer than that fire-gleam. Howled the fierce storm, Shaking the stanchions, beating 'gainst the door, Like to a maniacâaye, howl away, In baffled fury; for that din the more Endears our warm security within; We hug our joy the closer; so awhile Their mirth held holiday, for childish fun Once kindled, lacks not fuel; but elderhood Hath cares, and cares will cloud the brow, as then That man's; and as the fire he gazed upon Subsided from its blaze to a darkling heap, So did his temperature and pitch of soul Fall from its height: nor was she not aware, That loving thoughtful wife, of what she saw, But heeding all, spake not her sense of it: Why should she? for that cloud, haply chance strayed Across his light, may fleet as quickly away And all be clearâso she essayed awhile By tidings late and question manifold Graced with her liveliest cheer to stir his faint Spiritâbut vainlyâfor the moody cloak Will not disclose what it conceals within To any lamp, tho' gently asking itâ She saw and felt, and thus in winning wise:â âWhat ails thee Frederic, tell me now, And why this darkness on thy brow Some drooping sorrow mars thy cheerâ And Iâmust I sit idly here? Scarce could that merry boy beguile His father's sadness to a smileâ Nor the hearth blaze with cheerful play Drive sorrow from thy brow away. Oh thou art wont in yonder bed On this fond heart to rest thy head. E'en so, thy soul should now repose On my true bosom all its woes. For wherefore hast thou chosen me Thy own dear wedded wife to beâ But that each one should so partake All sorrow for the other's sake? Thy hopes and fears, thy woe and weal, Whate'er of burden thou dost feel, It is not all thine own to bear, But I thy consort claim my share: Then be my husband now indeed, And tell me all thy utmost need, Confess thy sorrow in mine ear, And be absolved from further fearâ That so our grief may be our gain; 'Tis sympathy best softens painâ Such faith is the one needful thing: The jewel of the marriage-ringâ But wherefore should I wander thus? Misgivings ne'er belonged to usâ Noâby this loving hearty kissâ I know thee all too well for thisâ And thou wer't e'en about to say What evil chance hath fallen this dayââ âYes, darling, thou hast judged me well, And I was thinking how to tellâ But thou wast happy sitting here, And loath was I to mar thy cheerâ Then for the causeâthou guessest trueâ As he good faith is like to do, Who reckons in a world like this, Full often bale and seldom blissâ Yesâthe storm bellowed o'er my path Like any other devil's wrathâ The weather fiends were all abroadâ But, t'was not that made drear my road. Noâit resides not in the airâ The mind alone makes foul or fair. Ayeâfor home-kindness hath a charm That freed me from all fear of harmâ And round about me played the while This hearth's glad blaze and thy sweet smile. That tramp, I knew would soon be past, And all is well that's well at lastâ But now, storm 'scaped as I sit here With nought to cross, and all to cheer, A darker cloud o'erhangs me still, The shadow of a coming illâ For know itâ'tis thy right to hearâ Know what my forethought knew whilere. Our shepherd hath sent down some new Food for his silly sheep to chewâ A scroll beyond my shallow wi â Must yet be scannedâa lawyer's writâ Lawyerâand father too of itâ Aye faithâ'tis e'en in such disguise This dove descends upon our eyes, As like a rascal robber kite As ever stoop'd from Harzberg heightâ But Hermann wherefore tarries he? 'Twas ne'er his wont so late to beâ Lucy my love, look up and sayâ Was not his promise for this day?â He asked, but she who should have answer'd him. The simple maid, confused of faculty, As one who flings away on sudden assault His arms, so did she miss her woman's wit Surprised to rosy shameâwith lurking love Beneath, heightening its huesâblushes and smiles Vying with coynessâeven such a look As she who dares not own, nor will deny Her bosom stamp, the seal by some sly shift Tricked from her safeguard, and in sudden show Urged home upon her conscience, must needs wear. Wear it, as did the queen of beauty and love Her meshy vest; captive confusedly, Struggling to hide her heartâfor so disguise Doth ever hamper and perplex itself In the folds of its own cloak: to speak she essayedâ But her soul's fluctuation swayed her words, And found no utteranceâshe pausedâand when Her father with kind speech would fill that pause, Another voice than his, dearer no less To her ears, was suddenly heard at the door, Loud shouting, craving housal from the storm. 'Twas heâHermann indeedâhis coming shone Like a fresh billet flung among the brands, Rekindling the spent fireâOh then was haste And pressure of the hands, and loving looks Claiming like pressure for commutual lips. Bliss not to beâfor love hath oft hard toil With nought but hope for his hireâout lengthening The patriarch's service, tho' that patriarch's span Of life, wherefrom all service draws supply, Is shrunk from centuries to scores of years. Sad minishmentâso creeping age usurps The hope of summer, and with evening shades Wedlock is overcloudedâdrear the waste! Where it spreads growth must wither, motherhood Become a mummy, and the spring a pool. With our whole manhood standing on one rank: Till that one rank be dwindled to one man, And death over his latest meal say graceâ No moreâdying himself upon that word For lack of food, and nought else left behind, Only a black oblivion. They loved true, That goodly pair; but, for they had no sure Homestead, nor any hearth might serve their love For his altar, therefore the pure flame they brought Availed them not; and all they offered him Being but sighs, and hopes, and promises, He wafted coldly on them back again, âMust wait and wither.â Yet that youthful guest To any coarse beholder rating him, Had no such fascination in his form To fix love's eager and most restless eye In starlike constancy, with devout grace Subduing girlhood; chastening the rash blood To brook delay, and dream the interval, Trance-like, all else forgetfulâa prize so high As like that same star thro' the pitchy dark, Makes itself present to the wishful sight, Foreshortening widest distance. There he stood Wearing no outward stamp of sovereignty, Beyond his deep-eyed earnestness of look: But radiance of beauty none; to light The soul of love thro' the eye's sympathy; Stately nor strong, but rather weakly of frame; Early upstarted in his spindled growth, And now a drooping stature; at each fair And merrymaking clownish holiday 'Mong thousands you might watch him, and each one For outward manhood, strength and gamesomeness, Likelier than he: who had looked hastily, Had sure so cheapened himâbut shrewder eyes Saw that within him which shone clearer forth, And nobler, like the true adamant light, From nearer view: that vase was highly wrought And purely: and its inner lamp so bright, As shed upon it a yet paler show To seem more virgin-like and soft than it was. And yet it was a burning, searching spirit, Tho' heavenly and holy, very intense, Like lightningâwhere it blazes, it may blast: Take heed of it. Oh, 'tis a fearful thing When the proud soul rebels 'gainst the poor bounds That would confine it, and, for it disdains To be barred by them, rather dares all risk To die assailing themâsuch was his willâ For he was come of lowly fatherhood, A tiller's son, if that be low, but noâ For such was our first father, and God so made Mankind to win their bread by their hand-work, And so content; no higher earthly aimâ Lest worldly wants hinder their one true hope, Uprising evermore from lowly life Toward Him in heaven. A Ploughman was his sire. But one not so enslaved unto his toil As to bedrudge his spirit; not clod-bound Serflike, but duly rendering to life's need His daily toil, and what remained to him, His freewill time, giving to Gospel-lore: A glad soul-giftâthere, where the heart-spring wells The grass is green, promise luxuriates, And produce outgrows hope. Thus his mind waxed While his years wasted: and long-time between His work and will he fairly halved himself; To each its share; enduring what he must; Enjoying what he might. But will is doom: And this our drift of energy within, Like the earth's bias, still, but very strong, Speeds its own orbitâSo, when vacancy Gave his hope room, and rumour quoted him, From every tongue, as worthy of his wish, That wish came home to himâhe left his plough To crush its clods beneath another's sway; And for his dull ox-team, plodding deep thro' Clayâslow tilthâstiff hard dragâhe undertook A school of clownish urchins. There he sate Above his rueful scholars, stern to see, But lived among his booksâforging quaint forms In his quick fancyâunhinging much safe-framed Knowledge, and on its staple, hanging instead Queer mystic meanings: e'en as upstarts use, Unwont to rule, and plagued with ceaseless itch To prove their power; turning settlement To stir and trouble, fain to catch with change The learned and unlearned rabble's idle gaze, And leaving nought, save their own sovereignty, Free from their meddling shifts; so, from timefast Roots, to bear fruit in State conservative. Such was the sire, a maggot maze of brain, But such was not the son. His father's mind Belike, when darkling he began to be, Was far in dreamland, for his body and soul Owned not one parentage. Those black wrangling books Were hateful to his tasteâwormwood not food, He left the dark forbidding tangled wood, And strayed to look for flowersâmany he found Wreathed into garlands fair by Poesy; And many an old romantic warlike tale Or lay of love, set all his soul aglow With wilful fire; such fuel did he find In the ivy-grown old Hall, which mid yon woods Proud as the family that dwelt in it Looked down on its domain: but that house owned A churlish lord; for high place draws not up The soul to its height; and wealth doth oft belie Most foully, with its own self-shaming dross Its stamp of worldly worth. Young Hermann went For helpmate to his sons, in games and books Alike: to upbuoy their heaviness, and gar Their slowness overtake the forward way, And their fog catch his fire,âsuch their sire's hope. And the likelihood took shapeâtheir darkness oped Its slumberous dullard eyes, and became dawn Harbinger haply of dayâmeantime that boy Wore the unhomelike habit of squire life, And in its high-day brightness pranked himself As tho' 'twere his own inbred quality, No less than to the leopard its gay skin, So born and so to dieâalas for him And his fond dreamâbuild not your home on sands, Your faith on fair showâ On a time it chanced As streams run swifter and more rashly foam Near the springheadâand so in boyish blood E'en as the humour stirs doth the tongue speak, And the hand strikeâa fit of moodiness Twixt him and one or other of his mates Blew their old friendship up: to it they went In blind outrageous onset. That old boast Of blood is but a braggardâthe ring knows No scutcheonsâin this truth was the young squire To raw defeature battered and bruised so, That his own mother met and knew him not. Such was their boyish broil: but the sire's wrathâ That was the harder meeting. âThankless cur, Starveling, and beggar's brat;â this and yet more The din of oaths, and lash of vengeful whip, So hailed they home the victorâagainst that storm He stood like a dull tortoise in its shell, Defying wrath to its worstâbut the brunt o'er, When stubbornness had sullenly stood out, Then rage took turnâhe hied him forth like a wild Beast from its cage outbroken, knowing not Nor heeding whitherâonly its keeper's rod, And threats, and taunts, it brooked not: rather all Wretchedness elsewhere, than a pamperling there. So in self-curse he wandered, branded worse Than was Cain's brow, a deep heart-brand: so out Faced and out-dared the blast to sweep him awayâ The worse the welcomer. Oh how he longed To fling off manhood, and be the rover hawk Wheeling o'er head; owning no lord, no friend, Nor fellow.âFor his home he loathed, and the tale He must tell there of that most shameful scourge. But where need rules, man mustâand hunger of bread, Starving the proud will, else untameable, Beggared him back againâhome he returned, If home it be, where no home-feeling is, And the hearth itself lacks heart: no kindred love, No kindliness. The lying dream was gone That tricked him with a thousand vanities, And nothing trueâonly its shadow left, And darkly 'neath that dreary pall he dweltâ For so doth grief build its most lasting stern Monuments on the ruins of our joy. Thence was his life one silent shameâbut what Pride will not say, shrewdness oft sees; and one There was, his father's kinsman, who loved him more That others scorned him; such true inkling he had Of what the hulking clowns but taunted and jeeredâ The lad's lone spirit; meet for issues high, But seeming all ungainly to such louts. And so he pitied the sad soulâwhose stream Dammed to stagnation, bred but vapour and fog. That man was but a needy shopkeeper In a starved, hopeless town, dealing out slight Wares, almanacks, childbooks, child-dainties, toysâ Traffic but trivial. With much ado He hired young Hermann to that sleepy shop With hopeâno golden oneâwhen it were voidâ (And when was it aught else? for its busiest Stir was from slumber to a rippling doze, From dark to lighter shades of vacancy)â Then to become its owner, and so confront That owl-eyed Mandarin, partners in death-life, And growing each day likerâ Hither he went Not willingly, but wilfully aloof, Hiding him in obscurity from scorn, And making a monk's cell of that small shop, For lonely stillness: but deep minds love shade. And there his spirit brooded on its thoughts; Of essences to make existences, And strengthen shape to substance: happy, thrice Happy, the youthful mind, with its food fresh To the palate, and the palate to its food, When love doth rule the feast: then what is great And good draws to it the ingenuous soul E'en as the waking eye yearns toward light From slumber: then romance of olden tales, Wars and distressful love, and chivalry Victorious o'er caitiff villany; These glories, and more glorious yet, the stern Patriot memories of Greece and Rome, Upstarting in fresh fervour from the page Of the old ChÅronean once again; These did he worship more than man's faith should His fellow-men; and in that love he read The dawn into noon-day, the noon to deep Nightâfor he felt his soul must wither else Without such food. Then again suddenly Would he roam forth, and be the boy once more, Fresh with his dews of dawnâfor in bygone Time, from his childhood's earliest consciousness His mould of mind was Nature's mystic cope. The vault-like sky, and broken uplands wild Where first he felt his being. Man is made From what surrounds him; all that he beholds Consciously: sense with spirit doth conspire To his full meaningâso the mind grows on Unheeding how or whence: and 'twas his hap To feel and welcome heavenly influence That raised him above earthly. Oft would he roam Alone upon the mountain-top with God, Free from contagion,âand with yearning faith, As any babe upon its mother's breast, Return to Natureâmaking hills and woods His beloved comrades; poring o'er the brook In its untrodden haunts, listening the voice Of the wild flashing reckless waterfall. Then would his heart bethrill him as he looked Down from his loftiest pitch on other hills O'ertopped by himâand shout and clap his hands, Glad as a bird uncaged: here I am free, But am I worthy of freedom? Then again Would exultation sink to deep still thought, And all he read of late, bright images, Heavenly aspirations, all he saw Around him, and felt fervently within, Kindled his heart's glowânot as heretofore, To boy-like wishfulness, but earnest will Reforming life's frame. So he brooded o'er Full many fancies, and brought one to form, First obvious, last approvedâthe fellowship Of strong men, lovers of their country, each For all, and all for each,âa wise forecast,â For union truly is strength. But where's the bond Wherewith to bind so frowardly a will, So manifold a being as man is? Made up of countless contrarieties, A thousand passions and perversities, Depraving Reason: seek it not on earth: The will that oversways all selfishness Must needs be heavenly. So was his own. He lit his torch from heaven, and with its blaze Kindled all hearts.âThe poor look gladly on high; Having scant comfort hereâfirst one of them And then another his endeavours drewâ Until he gathered them to hear his word, A lowly congregation and a small, But a godly preacher: from his truthful deep Soul pouring out the light that Heaven poured in, A glorious warm flood, a lustrous power; Unworldly, even as it came from Godâ Shaming all artifice as the sun shames Those earthly lights that shine only at night, And thro' the darkness. Ah! but they were blest The souls that waited on young Hermann then, To drink his doctrineânayâto bathe their life In waters welling from that rock of faith Whence he drew daily; and he wrought on them As the light works abroad, with no far-fetched Book-learning, or new fangling nicety, By Truth and earnestnessâreaching the head Thro' the heart. No gnawing fears, no stones for bread: Leaving deep lore in its dark holes to grub, Scattering, like chaff, high clouds. Faith, Freedom, and Love, These three he preached, with the Gospel for their code. So disentangling souls; clearing God's Word From knots and snares by priestcraft set in it. Thence he beheld in earth one commonwealth Level as ocean. Truly he preached with powerâ And wondrously that power waxed and took wing, An angel of good tidings: for he hoped To win all hearts with peace and gentleness. That even Privilege, having the hope Of better things, graced with a godlier grace, Would feel its excess worthless, strip its silly Unmanly lendings off, hold fellowship On a free level, and forgetting old dreams Forego itself. Alas! fond Faith, thou'rt but A saintly dove against the serpent guile That doth infest theeâyet it harms thee not: For 'tis not they who trick thee win at last, But thou who art confessed from 'mid their tricks An upright godly Truth: Such was the man Who cheered himself by that familiar fire, Hermann, a kingly soulâfor whom a throne Of loftier verse than this were worthier; There to hold state, and rule immortally Over the farthest realms of memory; Throughout Time's shoreless tractâOh! be his soul The spirit of this song, e'en as this song Is but a fainter echo of his fame. There was security and plenteous cheer, The blaze of the oak-fire, and loving hearts To make its warmth yet brighter. Sure if joy Be not found here, 'tis nowhere else on earthâ Nay thenâin heaven alone go look for itâ For here they feel it notâin spite of glad Seemings outside, the gnawworm works withinâ For the sad tale their father had just told Of the unlovely law, troubled them so, That they must look away from their home-bliss To scan the skyline for a far-off woe. That dismal day, their meeting brighten'd it, But sad its parting gloomâOh had that night Instead of sweeping her skirt over them, And so disclosing them again to day And daily care, hurried them sheer away Enveloped in her mantle's dreamless fold, To go with her revolving wheel along, Nor see the sun once moreâso had it been, Happier were theyâfor nowâe'en sleep, with dreams Of upstart trouble, racked themâyet no less The day-spring bright as ever, dawned abroad; As if each thought of darkness to drive off With darkness selfâso loving Nature wouldâ But we will not. Alas! that wilful man Should rather choose strangely to fret himself Than love his Maker: and in that one love Forget all hints of spite and hatefulness. BOOK II. There is a loveliness in the young day Unearthly: a bright spirit, simple and pure As faith and feeling, yet deep-souled as they. As Nature had then risen from her rest In the refreshment of some heavenly dream, And waking, stream'd from her o'erflowing eyes Thro' earth and air that dreamy radiance. Up then and outâfor where's the mud-born man Would doze his prime ingenuous life away, His yearning tide of youth? the freshening stir Of the early stream, knowing nor feeling not, But when its spring is deaden'd, its clear flow Clogged on the world's foul level to a pool, Then to wake slumbrously, and doze his life 'Neath sullen scum: this none so dull would doâ But whoso flings away his morning pearl Doth all as strange a thingâmaking a blotch Of that most fair virgin-like radiance, With self-forbidding darkness; lagging out The freshness and the new-born fragrancy, The silvery light and glistening dewiness, The sweet contemplative calm of the dawn, Till its young life be tainted a death-taint, In dust, and heat, and din of the noon-day. When man is rife, and nature, half fordone, Blent in his troublous being, seems almost To lose her ownâbut thouâbe not so foul: But spring up blithely, and look forth, and breathe, And walk abroad in thy soul's blessedness. Oh sad! this happiness we all might have, But many will not.âWhat! think ye to see Landscapes of green fields, waters, and deep woods In the charnel-house, when death shall fling ye there To lie and rot? NoâTime is short, unless With wakeful love ye lengthen itâboth early And lateâfor both the rising and setting sun Outstretch man's span-like shadow. And Grace, too, Beneath their thoughtful dew, grows toward Heaven. Go then; in that cool air refresh your sense, But first, open your soul, and learn God's love; 'Tis the best loreâfor love bestowed by you On Nature, she requites a thousand-fold With grace and blessednessâlook to her then, And do her suit, as a liegeman, dutiful, With early duty; awake, ariseânor sell The privilege and first-born hope of the day For a foul mess of dreams. Up and awayâ To the heavenly aspiration of free air, So your soul, bathed in Nature's purity Shall 'scape awhile the worldly taintâthe plague That wasteth at noon-day. So shall it live Its true self-life, as clearly circumstanced As stars in ether: even as they did, Hermann and Hess, forth issuing that day From their hot beds into the wholesome air, The garden's lively cool luxuriance, To drink the morn; and in the Eastern sun's Mild hope, and cheering earnest of their aim, To pace their pleasant pathâcommuning things That startled e'en the ear of privacy They were so fearful. âHermann,â thus began The host, âI know thee good and trueâa manâ No mere clay-mouldlingâone who walks the world's Trivial ways, o'er selfish narrow ruts, Not following nor heeding then, but forth Right to his own high ends. Thou'rt a true soulâ Of loftiness so soaring as transcends The very sight and not the scope alone Of the world's mole-eyed grubbersâelse their dust Would bedim e'en thy brightness, diamond-like Forth shining: such I greet thee; as worthiest, To partake, aye, and lead a plot, which e'en Whispered sounds dreadful, and proclaimed is the blast Of the war-trumpetâHermann, thou dost love My daughterânayâno word of complement. A father's feeling hath so told it me. For ever the young soul speaks forth by signs Truer than any tongue. Better 'twere soâ For, if thou lov'st her not, then hast thou been Since first thy welcome wont haunted our hearth Home-like, our ever inmost bosom-guest, A live-long lieâbecomes thee better then, The prompture of young blood, than the snake-guile Of colder hearts, self-coiled: beshrew thy lifeâ Well is she worth the price thou prizest her: Needs no fair phrase to set thy judgment rightâ That ne'er had wrong: enoughâno more of thisâ Nor had I touched it in so light a key But that I deemed it good, ere thou wert launched, To warn thee whither; to advise thee well Thro' what a stormy night that bridal star Faintly and far off, glimmers on thy hopeâ Know then, her life and mine linked in one chain, Stubborn as fate e'er forgedâconstraint too stern For that soft dove-like darling, that sweet girl. Aye, a curs'd chain hath dragged me down thus lowâ An iron weight; hard to uphold, much more To wield; thou beardless stripling say,âwould'st bear Thy share? Behoves thee then to be hardier Than manâthan my steel'd manhoodâlook thou here: Thou hast attached in fondness of love's faith Thy fortune to a home which, how it stands And who its indwellers, thou knowest not; More than some sorcerer had whirled thee away Within a Tartar's hutâmay'st ask the stars For counselâwho we areâwhence and why here. Well, Fame hath rumoured usâoutdone herselfâ And made a thousand of her hundred tongues And each a liar; houseless runawaysâ Loose swindling loonsâwhose clever handicraft O'er reached the dull thick walls should hold them in; Forgers of coin, writers who wrote the names Of others in so business-like a way That now they must be strangers to their ownâ Briefly, all felon styles and qualities Cling to us, with strange surmise, like the cloud That caps yon hillâmy fe on's capâsay'st thou? Nayâtheir own foolscap; but thy faith stood fast, No cronish tongue could shake itâWellâthe truth, Tho' men misdeem it much, is yet itself, And now bespeaks thy ear; listen it through. Thou see'st me now, grey, woe-begone; tho' still A man, wiry, uprightâfar other once Years back. I muse and wonder at myself, How such a change should be: sure I dream'd then: Or else dream now the being I'm become, So shrunk from the old man: as sad in late Years as in earlier frolic and free When sunshine filled the sky. My spendthrift life Foamed over, and failed, wastefully for-done, Ere half out-reckoned: were that allâwould t'were! Another flow might overflush that ebb, Recovering the bare strand: we had been friends Fortune and I, nor yet were wholly foes: Nor had disorder so unstated me; But timely thrift could set me up again More steadfast from that fall. I could have paid For wisdom the fool's price, and thankful so; As knowing well, what rashness plucks in the flower It ne'er can taste in fruitâthen had I giv'n My remnant means for a fresh harvest hope, Bidding thrift eke what waste scanted me, And stamped the steel, purer from minishment, Its dross of riot being purged away, With seal of earnest proofâYes, I had borne Worse ruin, and acknowledged it my due, But for the oppressors iron in my soul, Sharpened by law and pointedâlawâaye lawâ By Satan turned to his craftiest snare: should be To righteousness a shield and guardian; Yet was suborned against me to such wrong As the assassin's knife were welcomer And fairer tooâso sudden sharp a stroke, That like the clown afield, smitten to earth With the lightning flash, and to one senseless heap Confounded with his oxen and his plough, I rose half-stunned, and looked strangely around: Whether 'twere truth or glamourâhow that stroke Was stricken, why, whence, hearken me now: My father left me a fair heritageâ I undertook to till itâ'twas a farm, Might draw the keenest citizen from change To wed a country lifeâI cherished it, (Changing my bookish lore for busy toil) As tho' my happiness were rooted there: For still methought, thro' losses, revelry, Loose fellowship, like a kind loving wife, It brightened all my hopes and soothed my cares, Forgiving much to earnest husbandry. But Paradise were not itself indeed Unless a fiend should haunt itâwell thenâa wolfâ As we soon found him but too bitterly, Tho' in show, lamb-like seemingâso he walked 'Mong us, our preacher, clergyman, Church-headâ Our incubusâknow you the spot, my friend? Holzheim; a wealthy countryâa deep landâ That nursed our thriving stock from sire to son Thro' far tradition. Sorer be his curse Who drove me thenceâaye, tore me body and branch Uprooted. Now, beshrew me, but I think That horn of plenty was no idle tale, And there 'tis emptied out: wood, meadow, corn, Orchard, and garden, and the tendril hop, O'erpeering more the vine in lovely show, Than yielding to it in poetic vaunt And goodly worth. There many a river and brook Runs winding as for pastime, round about: Seems loth to quit the land. You may thread too, And thither, for the pleasure of such walks, Were time well spent, full many a field-side path, Lone, and unwonted, stealing shily on, And half o'ergrown, as doubtful of itself; Lest haply lord or squire, jealous belike Of nature, that she loves to sweeten toil, And gives not all her blessing to themselves, Should start some catch of law, and so shut out From the poor dust-choked peasant the one way That leads him on to her communion And God's: forthshadowed to the soul more deeply In Nature's wild and solemn lonelinessâ Howe'er such paths were many around usâone Too manyâso our shepherd said, and so Fulfilled his saying, for he wasted not His love upon his neighbours; but self-spent Deemed it safest bestowed: he pitched his stake There in the parsonage, and set his soul So earnestly to frame it to his will, As 'twere his everlasting all in all, And heaven but a fool's tale. Some straggling fields He bought to be an ample skirt and train To that small manse, homely content erewhile: Pleasant they were e'en to the clownish eye, Much more the musing mind. Southward they sloped, Their deep green flooded with the golden sun, And evermore in spring their glowing growth Showed teemingly the token of his love, With earliest blade and flower. Such a lone path Threaded those happy fields, not speeding through Straight forward, as for furtherance of haste, But sauntering on, a fairy-footed wild Shy fancy, heedless quite of aim or end; Purposed to take its pleasure, and in vague Careless diversion all indefinite Fulfil its sense of the scene. Oh! I have trod That path from child to man, times beyond count, And followed thro' its maze the deepening year From spring to winterâhad it led to heaven I could not love it more: and all alike, The folks that owned our church, elders and young, No lessâthe child for its own cheerful sake; The old, for once it was their lovers' walk, And now in darkness and decline of age A soothing memoryâbut what were this, And all the soul of gentleness beside To the cold spirit that only loves itself And hates whate'er may balk it in self-love? The way was needless, wasteful, better far Outdone, and the highway taken: loiterers Only could like its loneness; whispering hints Of danger to warm hearts. Courtship is safe Only 'neath eye of eldersâidle haunts Beget an idle life. Enoughâso said Our ghostly guide, whose cat-like walk brooked not Our hobnail noiseâfirst fairly, by kind words Friend-like and neighbour-like, hinting his wish: Next darkly surmising rectorial rights, And how the law might help him against us If here we hindered him: but when all else Was wasted, threats and bribes alikeâhe broke All bars with overbearing outrage of sheer Will: would doway the path: cross'd it with fence Hindrance ne'er seen before, nor longer then Than a few hours to blaze it all abroad Then smite it down: 'twas a stout gang of us Put hands to work. I stood thereâwho but I At the headâstood, nayâbut stirred me, and them too Until their heat seethed over. Down it came, And such a shouting uproar over it, As drowned the crash of downfall. So again Wide open as the sea the pathway stood Greeting each comer. That was nobly doneâ The nobler, that it ran a dangerous risk, To be paid off in evil coinâmy farm Held proudly its own produceâfree from titheâ That tribute to old Satan. I saw him once At the tithe-feast, grinning behind our host O'er his shrewd bargain: well he may, for it gives To him all Christian brotherhoodâfaith, peace, Good-will, to make his sport of them; and leaves The parson, flock, and field to decimate: So the Church hardens to a cold stone-heap, Graceless, unlovely. Soulless but for spite, A burden of dead weight on the groaning land That doth uphold it. 'Tis a galling ill To many, and a crushing one to me. For likelier scourge none did he findâI mean, Not Satan, but that other kind black friend, So ready to his hand,âthe law, the law, He touched the spring, and gave the engine way Which brays, like the Indian car, to bloodless heaps The crowd of wretches whom their craziness Hath set across its path. 'Tis a short tale. He challenged my exemption from his due, Would have my proofs set forth: I who knew nought, Nor had no title save by olden truth From sire foregone delivered down to son; And plain good faith and price of privilege Paid to the height of its worth: I, poor lost soul, Was madden'd, to seek truth from lawyers, grace From hell: to hire, he against me, and I 'Gainst him, some scrabbling, bloated, spider-men Bewigged, begowned; to read thro' spectacles My right, clear to each neighbour as sunbeams, From old crone-skins. That was no fair man's fight: I felt befooled by their law-jargon, and fain Would rid me of such cramping uncouth suit, And so have doneâbut death and fury, it stuck E'en to my substance like a venomous shirt, And parted, only with my flesh withal, Leaving me bare to the bone: my wealth ground down, And scatter'd to the winds: my livelihood Outcast from that fair land where I was born: Myself beggared to ragsâmy home laid wasteâ And if my fortune run her course to the end Even so frowardly as thus far forth, My sons turned thief, my daughters prostitute: Have you then any heart for sympathy? Prithee laugh with me, as the fiend doth now, At such a merry upshot: such kind care From shepherd to his sheep. Ah, yes, good Church, I'll give thee thy full due, if I withhold One curse of all I owe thee,ânay but no Word cursesâI am strong and they are weak. 'Tis my wrath, seething, heaves them uppermost. Listen, a sadder strainâso when the damp Prison had quite diseased my wonted health, And in its stead set a strange fever up To ride aspur, and quicken my poor blood To a mad heat; till nature sank downright, Hopeless to rise again: then the kind souls Seeing the vampire had so sucked my veins, And left me but the shell of my own self, Pith-hollowed; when their bitterness with short Delay must have delivered me to death, And so been mercy indeed; this they withheld: But sent me forth, outcast, to beg my bread, Or starve for lack of it: see'st thou yon books? The one lone precious remnant of that wreckâ Aye, take them down; read, learn, and cherish them. For they are such as priests and lordlings hate, And free souls loveâmy father's teachers erewhile, Now mineâwell, books are living things; and Iâ I'm not quite deadâbut this bare life! with no Livelihoodâsuch thou see'st meâa naked man With hardly a breadcrust besideâbut here To chew the cud of wrath, and sour-sweet dear Revengeâso rate meâthen bethink thee well. Is it a home like this, so bare and waste, Open to each onswoop of misery Thro' breaches of most ruinous beggary: E'en from the roof to the foundation-stone Conflicted with all elements of wrath, That thou would'st trust to hold a dog of thine For one half-hour, much less thy livelong hopes, Thy heart's most delicate innermost ware, Thy wife and babes and all. Ah, well, I see The warm assurance beaming from thine eye, And lighting what were else wholly forlorn With a wild lustre of joy. Yes, 'tis nought else, Love and thy youthful blood are so.âAh, well, But stayâone wordâmay bid thee yet, beware. Thou hast heard much of ill, but not the worstâ Listen it now. Fortune hath hunted me To this my last poor hold, my hearth, my home, And stabbed me there: look now around, and see How blithe the cheer she has left me. Come what will She's still my foe; her hate with its own spite Feeds itselfânot from me: she's gnawed me bare To these hard bones: but, Hermann, mark me this. She haunts my home no moreâso help me Heaven I'll leave my house to the rats, and march forthright To meet her warrior-like, on some far field She little wots of: for mark this again. I've wrestled with the law, and chance or craft Hath flung me a shrewd fall: howe'er, not so, Like the angel with the patriarch of old, As to unstring my sinewsâno; sheer strength Laid me thus low, and by sheer strength again I'll raise me sure as I stand here, I'll stake My life on't: aye, stake this torn paper scrap Against the world, for its whole wealth to win. That fire hath scoured my rust, cleared me to steelâ 'Tis in me, and shall outâwhat tho' no more Fair weather'd fortune dally with my sail, Yet may the blast of hate speed me as well, Raising a surge so stormy, as may bear The daring helmsman over shallow and sand, Gathered or left, to bar free way: for so Fraud heaping lumber and dead hindrance up Then calls it lawâwhat's that? a name, no more, And scarce so muchâfor that good holy name Belongs not to time-hallowed rotten wrong. But wherefore this to thee? Thou, my young friend, Wast never thus woe-worn; this gnawing grief Is strange to thee, and all these stormy wild Workings, sheer madness: yet forgive it me. The dullest pool if stirred unto its depth Breathes forth its vent in foam. My rage has clenched My fist, but to a fair dispassioned palm Thus I disclose itâread, if can'st, its lines. My fallâ'tis so far goodâit frees meâI've set My life and its belongings, my whole state, At a straw's worthâe'en so, and that same straw So worthless, I devote it unto fire, That the world may blaze from it. Oh! 'tis most trueâ We weaken as we widen: the will works Strongest where narrowest: when my wealth lived At large, it flagged in bounds it could not fill: Now in small space, self-shrunk, like embers thrown Aheap, my spirit gathers to a heart Of pulse so mighty, as shall speed life-blood Thro' the universal Man. Feel thou my handâ Methinks I'm steel'd from flesh to adamant; Or is it but my soul's intensity That sets each sinew astrain. Nayâtis much moreâ For the sharp trials I have undergone Have burned each weaker element to smoke, And left but metalâit drives me from within, To the trialâAh! thou shak'st thy head; and that Dooms deathâto this mad fitâfor soâwould'st speak, Had'st called itâWellâhowe'er by others called, 'Tis Truth and Manhood known and felt by meâ Here, where behoves in the heartâAye, boy, 'tis that, Wars me against the worldâBut I am one: And many more were needed for this great Onset, which eastward and to west, shall spread Its angel wings, high-flying, wide as the world, Atoning all mankind, scattering light, Blessing where'er it goes. But what are words Written on water? what is Truth to him Who hath a soul of sand-like quality, Inconstant to such seal? you loremen, so I've found 'em, are weak-willed. Tell me then first How art thou tempered? does thy spirit aspire? Thy blood run warm? Hast thou a heart to dare? A hand to do? and that for the deed-sake, The only good of man, and glory of God; Not for self-love? if thou say'st no, I say Get thee another wife to nurse thee at home: Thou graftest not thyself upon my stock, Being of such a strain. For I am one Will have no meddler come within my rangeâ Must wholly work my will; look to my aim, And by it shape their own: well it behoves Where all is war without, to hold within The bond of fellowship, all under one. Howe'er, lest passion blind thee, and hot blood Hurry thee to rush on unwittingly, Where wariness should scan the stakes, and weigh The likely loss against the gain of them; I'll give thy judgment footing where to stand And take her levelâIf hope have room enough To build, and means withal ready to hand, Or else despair be wisdom; much, erewhile, I've told thee of my meaning, but in shadow Aloneânow since I trust thee, its whole truth I'll show thee, blood and bones, body and soul. Thou'st wonder'd what far chance should fling me here, Like a lone bird stormed by the hurricane, Clean from its climate and winged fellowship To pine on the ocean rock. The dry leaf drifts As the wind drives itâthat is daily Truth: And if thou wert a stranger to my faith So would I foil thy questionâbut disguise To cowardsâI need it not. 'Twas prideâone wordâ That brought me to this haunt of poverty: I would not hang my rags on that same staff Whence my brave silken flaunting flag e'erwhile Lorded it o'er the levelâthat were good Cause, tho' none elseâfor Man's but a child still Within opinion's sway: behoves him first Unshackle her unreasoning fetters, then Forth freelyâthoughts too wider, deeper, I had Hitherâfor while my wrongs were bitterest, And anger, with the hot knife in his hand Whisper'd me, up, and strikeâthen did I think Of what full often I heard formerly, That here, amid these hills, more than elsewhere Throughout our Fatherland, Gospel Truth sways, And the foul sham that men miscall the Church Stands but on law, not love; feeds to fat rot Its hirelingsâtakes the fleece, and the hate withal; Leaving the flock to follow and love their own Shepherdâhere then, methought for my main works Fulfilment, is the fellowship of hate Doughtier for all upbreak to be done, Than fellow-love. Here is the field for me. Here I may sow, and reap my harvestage When ripe, if hearts and hands be towardly, And luck befriend meâhere I standâand hence I startâbut whitherâAh! that needs much thought. The compass and the drift of our design, Its hope of good, its method, and its means; What likelihood doth beckon thee ahead To dare the travail for the birth from it, And what fear whispers, listen, if thou wilt. But first, my friend, behoves us look around From the platform we now hold to the end we aim. How best to shape our forecastâfirst thenâand lastâ I see no comfort of the things that are, But only a far hope of what may be, If manhood drive on the determinate mind, And wish ascend to willâfor look but forth; How this world's body hath o'ergrown its soul; While dwindling all as swiftly, happiness Hath lost its life-blood: shrunk awayâto a shadeâ A skeletonâhung up in the Sophist's shop For show, for our shame tooâwhose but our own Is this most bitter blame? self-made, self-marred Is the manâin olden times, now fabulous deemed, Because our souls are shamed beneath their truth; Ere rapine was yet rife within the world, Each had his own; each held and handed on To his son's toil the homestead and the plot From the main folks-land cantled out to him. And when that main was parcelledâthen all offâ All sons, but one, to farther, wilder lands; And so life waxed and waxed: Nature's free boon Man partook thankfully, wrought thence his need, Then freely quitted it to who came next. Nor yet had self-love, stealthily at first, Till strengthened by self-law; then proud and high Handed in right of its own wilful wrong, Claimed 'gainst the need of other landless men More than its hand could hold or righteous toil Improve to profitâso diswarranting Nature's own right and God's most earnest law That man shall earn his daily bread by sweat Of his own brow: first starving industry Then heaping with her fruits the listless lap Of luxury, that looks but how to waste In whims that idly haunt her vacancy What toil had hardly won: till riches, so Foully o'erheaped but turn to rottenness, Stinking in their fastidious owner's sense, Choking each outlet of his working will, And clogging his life-blood and wealth alike From stream to swamp. Ah! how this Giant World Most like a craftsman of besotted soul Reels drunkenly from wasteful wantonness To lack of bread and household beggary! Swilling in one most swinish hour a year's Home-gladnessâin untoward wild excess, Staggering: hither first, then thither away Never to hold the mean. Yes, selfishness Hath grown among us from a peevish child To a giant; so strangely o'erstriding us That his huge presence confounds East and West. Feeding himself on a thousand lowly rights To the one proud wrong he is: usurping all Earth in a dismal shadow of eclipse, And nothing said, but gainsayers o'erawed. So doth man curse his brother with Cain's curse To be a castaway: no rightful home Freehold; no rest for his foot; but the son born Strange to his mother, and forbid to draw From her full bosom his hard-earned sustenance And birthright: Noâbedrudge theeâboy and man Toiling; toil out the marrow from thy bones That I may waste thy fruits in riotous Wassail, and fling thee husks for all thy hireâ So pride ordains him, and so, day by day, His life, a twofold hardship, toil and want, Grows to the grave, till Death composes him From his low fever, a lagging comforter. But who should say such things as these should beâ If any, call him not a man, unless Mankind that was be new-named Selfishness. Selfishness puffed to pride by oppression's foot, Which o'er this wind-blown world to assert its will, Crushing the many down, raises the few To bloated pomp and ill pre-eminence. Ah! I have grieved at this till grief became My very soul and true essential self. YesâHermann, the whole heart is sick, and the head As faintâbut we, the body, oh had we, Instead of Patience to outwear our wrongs, Courage to right themâbut to wish is weak And womanlyâthe earnest will it is, Ever onworking till its goal be won, That marks the man. Then thusâall life doth grow, Since witchcraft lost its trick, and Nature thence Thro' the wide world went steadily her way, From a small spot to full development. Therefore behoves us a beginning first To be the germ of the end. But where to find The man and means, the time, and circumstance, Of such a fit concurrence all in one, To hit our 'scope? Where is the goodly stone Of such true everlasting quality To serve our revolutionary wheels, For centre and for stay.âLo, here I amâ You see me. I am heâone manâbut one Who will abide all brunt, out-face all foes, Strive onward against doom and death itself, Aye, and go snatch his purpose from hell fire, Than miss it. Sure, so set, and strained to the head, Never to fail, unless the string snap short, And life fail first. Well,â'tis a stalwart willâ Could I but find the way. Nayâthat some way Shall wait on that same will, which oft, with swift Outshot, straightforward, and determinate, E'en as a spider shooting on its game, Out of itself doth frame itself a path, And so outdoes impossibility: Fooling surmise, leaving security Aghast, and blear-eyed wonderment agape, Welding unlikely ends, and safe across Bridging the deep sea. Trust me, who outwills Outworks. And be this true, then truly I'm born, I, even I, to crush this crazy old Clay-world, and frame it to new honor and use. To redress lawsâto darken palaces And thrones with shadow of a giant force Striding amain to his endâshuffle the lots Of high and low, lordling and underling, Then deal them out anew. Lastly, set up, The Gospel, for life's light and governance, Upon the ruins of that charnel Church Wherefrom the soulâsave some slight sparkâis fled From among skulls and bones. But spirit will breathe, And light will shine; and so, e'er the end come, Truth ever gives the token of herself And makes her flame of the foul rubbish-pile Wherewith obstruction would have stifled her. Must blaze itself instead. What say'st thou, boy? And is not this a project thrills e'en fear With faith's own glow? a purpose holier Than prayer, a wafture of the coming good More godly than all incense? Nay, no wordâ I see full well the burden your mind bears: And what your tongue's forbidden, your looks speak Swifter and surer. You tell me, 'tis a deed, Brimful of danger, such as craziness Might dream, but to endeavour it, beyond Madness itself: as well might the mole strive To unsettle yonder mountain from its stand And build another hundreds higher fold Than I to rear a fabric such as this With my best powerâpowerânay feeblenessâ A feebleness arrayed 'gainst giant strength On the other side: such forecross barrier As dwarfs the highest that daring ever dreamed, And whoso undertakes it, should climb heaven For foreproof of his workâwhich if fulfilled Were a miracle, and hardly then believed; Since by it worldly wont were all belied. For what can will 'gainst power and privilege And that substantial wealth which backs with its weight The edge of energy, and so drives home Many an onset, which else were but a reed Launched 'gainst a tower of brass? so much for the hope: Which reason, howsoe'er she strain her eye On the utmost verge of faint-edged likelihood Beholds not. Yet doth wilfulness, which sees Whate'er it wills, presume them here at hand. Vouching for Truth her idle phantasies, Her marsh-lights gleaming but in dark. Fond dreams Of peace and plenty, love and levelhood, Such as ne'er had fulfilment, nor e'er will, Till earth shall become heavenâso would'st thou Make hope a fool, and zeal a maniac, The old trick of power, strong in privileged Possessionâneeds but brazen forehead and lungs To abash her gainsayers, and scare away The searcherâanswering each asker, as doth The surly upstart huffing driver his slave, âObey nor reason why.â Well, the gagged cock Is easy overcrowed: but words are words Tho' they ape God's thunderâaye, and arms are arms. Look on them, hanging idly by that wall, Not always destined so: no, for right well I've learned their deadliest skill, and thoroughly Enured me. Come a hundred bayonets Against this hut, loopholed and stiffly barred; They shall spend many hireling lives for oneâ And feel their gain but lossâneeds but once so Proven, forthwith the people will rise up In fiery courage from that cowardice, Which holds the soldier slave for more than man, And the freeman lessâenough, and now to works, Since words on either side are spent in vain. BOOK III. Freedom, Love, Light, and Truth, these are four things That waste nor wane while they impart themselves; Nayârather wax the wider for each help They lend to a weak neighbour.âAnd yet weâ We narrowlandersâkindly, enlightened, free, (Self-bragging so, and so by onlookers Not quite unworthily nor wrongfully Forthholden), tho' we love mainly that fair Holy and happy fourfold sisterhood (Bating the many who hate it; the slave souls, The worldly wealthy, coward grovellers, Who love but their own swine-like grovelling selves), Yet even weâthe friendlier bulkâwe love, Not well, but too self wisely; we love Truth And freedom, not as any flower loves light, Butâas gripers love gold: for our self-sake And against others: I want itâgive it meâ To hold in my own hand. So the babe cries For its toyâso man for freedom. Thus tho' we loveâ Nayâthat's a holy wordâbut tho' we like Freedom for ourselves, we hate not tyranny O'er othersâWhy? for that dull foil lends life To our free jewelâmakes us feel ourselves Manlier some and mightier than our slave Neighboursâin freedom's fair and flowing robes We walk forth proudly among wretches whose rags Hide not their chainsânayâbut true freedom is love Self-spreadingâcome then who will, I welcome yeâ Come one, come allâcome beggars, maimed, halt, blind, Come to this earthly gospel of free grace, And from it frame ye for that heavenly one. Only before we free ye for the main Folks-rule, each for self-rule, should free yourselves. From slavery of sensual swinishness, Lust, drunkeness, to mindful self-control. From idleness, and grovelling begging want To self-dependence thro' good steady work. From taking rated help to giving it. So private worth proves publicâwhy should the hedge Beggar about the state-house busy him Ere he has built his own? in its self-men, Whoever, few or many, high or low, Its standards, its upholders, stands the whole state, Else by their rottenness or weakness, falls. Thence, whosoe'er by his own working will Becomes self-free, we'll make him state-free too With franchiseâwhile the public burden he sharesâ For choice of his state-rulersâbut for that How prove his fitness? needs notâlivelihood Is likelihoodâno better proof needs be. Who from his steady earnings makes and holds His home, and helps his country, further pledge He owes it not: may claim from it free rightsâ So should the franchise mark the man from the mob With signal stamp: e'en of the rabble, some Might feel it, drawing them up towards it As with magnetic virtueâfrom their foul Sensual sty to cross the bar, and take Manlier stand and rightful fellowship. But they, whose will is but to grovel in mire There leave themâwhat to them is the cause of Christ And country? what the franchise but a free Ticket, to swill their day, or wreak their spite Against their hated betters; and in fiend Glee hand them over to some faction's yoke Or tyrant's? 'Tis an easy downward slope From recklessness of rabble rule, to the foul Self-sway of despots,âthe state-rot, death-cold, For it kills all folk-life. We, then, who draw The state-car, will, if wise, while yet in time, Hold back against such downfall to mob-rule Strongly and sternly as when erst we strove Uphillâhardly, and with slow strain, forthright For freedom. Time for wheels, and time for drag, Which of the two, needs wisdom. Else that slope Once taken, hard the stress, so old Truth sang, To rise again from hellâfrom man's self-mire Yet harderâfor hell-pains were stings and spurs. But ah! what hope when swinish herds give sway To him who but once stuffs and swills them, and takes Their grunted ayes in payment? of ought higher What care they? kick them and cudgel if he will, Fling all filth o'er them, hurt nor shame is theirs, They feel it not. But like their old compeers Circean, they bethrong their keeper's court, Awaiting the coarse slush he throws to them, And hustling back those who feel, know, and hate Their wrong and foul wrongdoer, and as men Would right it: e'en these few are fewer each day, And fainter. The old Roman virtue is dead, Tyrannicide: the heroic godly will Herculean, that smote howe'er it could The bloody, lewd, self-bloating atheist Usurper, drunk with felony forsworn And all his followersâthat hateful brood Bred with him from corruption's slimy swamp, Smote him, not with law's doom, for how? like the old Scyrian, he lopped the lawâhands and feet off Then with fiend jeer, âNow strike me;â no then, not With his self-law garbled for his self-ends, But with its sturdy downright stalwart club Dashing to dust his treason, in spite of shams And all pretences. So the heroic will Freed the old Greek and Roman fellowships, And so, its work fulfilled, won its reward, By thankful Truth throned everlastingly High up in heaven. But, thou, flunkiest Of folks, he called thee so, who knew thee well, Fulfil thy calling: kicked and cuffed as thou art, Nay, cringing dost submit thyself to be: Bruised, gagged, tax-ground, soldier'd to slavishness. Lie downâlow in thy mireâthy cowering choiceâ Ye've drawn those dregsâmust drink them. Ye chose a wolf For your shepherd's dog. Howe'er, ye suffer him: Yield ye then to your yokeâspend, slay, at his beck: Shout for him, pray for him, where public prayer May hope good payment; but shout loudly, and so Sham out, or at least, sham over, your heart's hate, And fear, and shame, all your true feelings; of them And him, make one huge sham with babbling breath. Then chew your slave-cudâbut Tyrannicideâ Think not, nor talk, much less try that stern thing, It needs a high heroic pitch of soul With Milton, Tully, Locke, and o'er them all God's holy writ for vouchers. Shame them not By thy half-headed and half-hearted shamsâ Lift not thy hand so loftily: poor frog? 'Tis not thy braggart breath will swell thee out To their bold bulk. Then, in those days, were men. But now, ah, no! their mould is broken, and we Can but pick up and handle, and scan the bitsâ Forsooth, sound ware, clear, strong, fire-clean: but ours, Why so much weaker? There's the murdering wretch, But where's the man? The hour is come, but the manâ Cowards! why wait him? alas, wait we must Till he rise, our star, our sun, till the old folks' right Shall find a new forefighterâa Hercules Fresh soul'd and steel'd for freedom: fearless and strong Alike to smite the giant, to clean out The filth-heaped stalls of state-craft, and to crush The wily self-coil'd many headed snake, Killing the country with corruptive bloat Of poison. Hark to the giant! he screams out He, whose maw gloated o'er man, woman, and child, Now that the Hero's club darkens his head, He screams out âMurderââand the hissing snakeâ Smitten too sharp for wiles and fangs to work Shrieks murderâand the tyrantâhe, too, who heaped These and all hellish crimes on his own head With fire, and sword, and poisonous tropic bogs Deadlier than LernÅan; he who stabbed In the dark, behind her back, the commonweal Which to uphold so foully he forswore; Slaying her faithful sons and followers With the very weapons that she trusted him To ward wrong from them; he whom treachery Where else most hateful, must yet blush thro' its worst Blackness to feel itself out-done by him; Now, with the avenger's shadow in night dreams Scaring his wolfish eyes, he, too, yells out, âMurder, forbear me, to kill me is crimeâ But Iâmy thousand murders hallow me. I'm dipped so deeply in that hellish Styx To immortal holiness.â Hark the fiend's laugh, Echoes his scream: but steel and shot, ah no! Nor e'en the rope, 'twould shrink with shame from such Carrion: then hold thy hand, Tyrannicide, That name means warlike weaponsâno such blood Shall sully themâthe cool deliberate law When man returns to itâas surely he will, After full hearing and well witnessed search, Shall doom thee to fit fellowship with those Thou didst subornâto the soldiers' jakesâdeep down, To be smothered in its foulestâthere be thy true Congenial home, and self-wrought monument; For thee and for thy memoryâso thy last Scene shall fulfil late justice; and thy death Betoken and reward meetly thy life, So God's dark ways were justified to men. Thence were all thankfulâall but flunkeydom, With its pale sobs and shrieksââWhat! murder a king! Eh, Flunkey! dost so hate king-murderers?â âYes, surely!â âWell, thou'rt right. Here, then, hate himâ He's the king-murderer; of murderers The Kingâthe Emperorâbut comfort theeâ We give him but one drop from his own cup, Whence thousands, scores of thousands, by that foul Wretch, whom Hellâah! but to the ears polite Of Flunkeyhood, Hell is too horribleâ Thou'rt all aghast at it, and heâbut, noâ Enough of that rank stenchâstir it no moreâ Only a word to thee: Thou'rt in high placeâ Flunkeyship is a ladder of many steps; Thou hast thy servantsâsuppose then, thy steward: Thou giv'st him thy whole household to control, As Pharaoh to Joseph. He forecasts His plan, forelays his train, bribes thy men, creeps Around at midnight, clutches all he can, Murders thy sons who stand for duty and thee; Others, away to prison and tropic swamps, Gags all the restâthee tooâsquanders thy wealth On wanton strife, pomp, riot, and ruffian Followers; or wasteful works, meant but to bribe Thy workmen.âThou, meantime, pining in slave Wretchedness; should the thought arise to thee, Must I for ever live this foul sewer-life? Can I not free me? Shoot him, stab him down! How unmanly were thy thought, how wicked! Eh, Flunkey? Should leave him, say'st thou, to the lawâ What to his own lawâhis own hireling gangâ His own self-judgmentâhis own balloters, Prefects and Mayors, correcting to his own Self-sacrificing will, the waywardness Of universal suffrage? Oh most wise Flunkey! Yes, for such law is good enough For thee, no better thou deserv'stâbut weâ We're not all Flunkeys.â That guest listened his host: A swirling speech of wormwood bitterness. I've said, my aim is lofty. Nothing less Than happiness thro' fellowship to man In all that laws, framing his outward life, Make for his good or ill. So high to build Behoves me from the ground self to begin. For, Hermann, mark me this; much have they erred The patchers of each crazy polity, Looking to selfishness of severalty More than the folks' main good; taking no heed, Ever as fresh materials come to hand By growth of men and wealth, traffic and skill, To frame them in after the primal plan Lopping the rank outgrowth of greediness Down to proportion and fair ordinance. Reducing all to the original rule Whate'er accrued: and so throughout their task Keeping their eye still on the central Truth, To truthen their whole work; but they, instead Tampered their high trust, deeming it enough Could they but hold what others handed them, However blindly: reckoning the far Following ages of their fellow-men For nothing: crowded in a ciphers' round. Thus heartless arrogance o'erstrode the space Wide all enough for thousand worthier needs With one self-usurpationâevermore Spreading and towering, till the giant pile Strong in o'erbearing bulk, defied the hate That scowled on it, to stir it from its stand. And scorned the helpless scowler. Thus mankind Is a body plagued with boils: bloating themselves, Starving the sinews: till the heart of health Sickens, the blood is tainted, the life droops. Thus the old rule bewrays us; and its lines, Crooked and crazy, serve but to contrast Reason's strait project, strait and trueâI mean No otherânot as worldly statesmen are wont, Dotards of old tradition, to grope on Their aimless twisted way; sideling, aslant, Or backward, as selfcraft finds likelihood, But to retrace our forefathers vague maze And start from Truth's first stand: they were bewrayed Thence, and went wrong; we must now speed aright. Surer to win from that forelossâsince dear Experience is wisdom. The old wall Is down on those who daubed its rottenness With their raw mortarâso let it e'en lie. Away with statecraft's saws, bury the dead, And let the quick live their own life; heed not The blear-eyed mumblers who would cripple us To their own slowth; level all privilegeâ And boil our canker'd constitution up To fervency and fulness of young blood In the fierce caldron of democracy. But hold, all this sham thunder, thou wilt say, Betokens nought but brazen hollowness: See then the substanceâfirst, we must lay well Our ground-work: nay, 'tis there, already laid,â The folk-stone, the yore-rockâthe good land-self That underlies all manhood and all life; That rock, as we were hewn from it, so now Return we to it, to our broad deep base. Else how should revolution e'er have end, Unless the land's strong substance stay its wheel, And giving body to its theory, Fix fast its airy schemeâall project else Is but a cheapjack's whirligig, may wheel In air, but never work in this stiff world. So they miss'd aim, the word-wise drivellers, Statecrafty, who erst stamped their seal on France, Marring a likely metal. There, as here, Would'st have the people stand up steadfastly, Give them the landsteadâgiven but once, no fear Lest old prescription wrest it back from them; Or frame another fraud, having no ground But only the thin air to build upon. But they, the dolts, wise but in words alone, Set for a bolt, a feather on their string, And shot their game awayâthe folk came on To that loud call, and conquered ere they came; But when, at last, none had a crust the more Of bread for his belly, or a rag for his back, Each looked at the other, and saw fruitless hope And rage, reflected from his brother's face Upon his own. Then that same hollow trash Of husks and windbags taken in fair words, They threw it back in curses; leaving all They'd done for whoso listed to undo, Their beacon blouted, their faith fooled, their shouts A hiss of scorn, their framework all ungeared; Till Freedom, helplessly fluttering, from her height Fell down; fell through mere void, and lack of stay Should give her wings their purchaseâbut this lack Now in this land shall hinder us no more; No! that manhood may liveâunstunted, unthralled, The old foreright must die; the Lord's accursed Landlockâshall be henceforth a grandsire's tale, For scorn and wonder to his staring sons. Justice shall speak in the universal shout, Startling the noisy din of arrogance To a faint crouching fear: drowning all else, Curses, complaints, and spiteful selfishness In its stern whelming utterance of folks'-will. And only in such outbreak have we hope, For what is our disease? The custom and course, Nay, ingrown curse of law: which lawmongers Are likelier far to aggravate than heal. No, manhood must unshackle and uplift man To a stateholderâfrom the state aloneâ Free on freelandâno idle ownershipâ But our kind mother earth shall thence bestow Her wealth on whoso wins it by his work, Not on the robber of God's general gift, Who looks but on, feeding his humours foul Of idleness from the salt sweat of serfs. Hard bread, no thanks. This done, the folk is freed. For so the Giant Alazonocracy Sundered from hold on earthâwhich bred him first And ever pampers himâwhereon indeed Is strung the very navel of his life, Shall dree though late his death-dole. Freedom and hope Shall cheer the working swain and townsman too, The one reaping his toil, the other assured Of his toil's worth, disfettered and dearth free, Buying two loaves of the sturdy husbandman For what the greedy landlord grudged him oneâ So making plenty, erst as strange to him As angels upon earth, his housemate now, Homely, as o'er his hearth his own goodwife, Nor craving aught beside.âThis were a stroke Indeed, not here and there a bough trimmed off, But the root severed. Such upbreak must beâ For without Revolution true reform Is noneâno other hope for old crazed states. Who crosses rotten ground, tangled with briars, Broken with stub and stone, bogged with foul ooze, Corrupt, behoves him with high hand to smite Those breasting brambles, with high striding foot To o'erstep bog and plashet; hindrances Which to get through by any lawful path, Trial and time were hopeless. Hear me once more. What fear deems hardest, is oft easiest To the determinate strong stubborn will: And desperate to the brave is bravest hope. For safety dwells not in the shallow sands Of statecraft, but in mid-sea depth, where sails The ship as free and fearless as its wind, Tho' dotards ween it dangerous. Strike, I say, The heart, each limb at once feels the death-stroke And fallsâwould'st hurl the bull and hold him down, Grapple him by the horns. So with strong hand If we be wise, must we drag privilege Down from its throne, and set up right instead: Without all parley, will it please or no. All this to do is but to free the ground Godly enfranchisement. That toil, so stirred, May rise and ply amain its thousand arms, Thrashing to chaff and scattering to wind Whoever dares withstand it. Then this land From squire and parson freed, a kind of men Akin to the black slug and cankerworm, Shall trample that incarnate curseâah noâ For flesh and blood it bares from off our bonesâ Well then, that barebone cornlaw, Hell's own child. Next, to crown free welfare with holiness This Church, now standing, but as a monument Only, of death and mouldering bones within, Instead of Faith and Love; shall be renewed Loftier in lowliness than erst in pride; Abated from its height, but all the more Outspread in compass of its heaven-like cope, Lovingly to embrace all Christian souls, One fold, one shepherd: and Christ's ministers, No more masks, parsons, shams; but with free love Offering free graceâbestowing heavenly gifts, And taking earthly: behold this and sayâ Was ever since the dawn of Paradise, Or the thousand years of bliss the prophet saw A sight so holyâas foreseen, e'en so Fulfilled, may heaven vouchsafe itâsuch is my end. And to that end behoves us to make sure The meansâbut how and whereâwhat call hath power To compel those strong spirits from the deep? Well, when I need them, I will call, and they Shall come: but man is his own might: can work His needs, or else forego themâHermann, I say, There dwells a witchcraft in the vehement will That brings the world to its wake; sailing the sea In a cockle-shell, and riding the thin air On a straw's edge. The strong man makes his means Which weaklings cannot wield when made for them. My means, lad, are my men: for hearts there are Of glowing temper whom I know and trust, Will hazard all for such a hope, and hold (Whene'er their country's welfare calls them on) The greatest daring for the goodliest deed; Deeming no height above their enterprise, No pitch too shrewdly strained, if but the prize Warrant the perilâand by godliness They are transformed outright from sense to Faith, Already in their hearts to hold the end Ere the beginning: now, like herds with like: And those I know of such a quality May draw in others of their bias and bent, To bide alike whate'er befal. So wellâ And so my circle spreads: yet haply hope Belies me, whispering that the brotherhood Is heartwhole in this cause with God and me. Say, is that hope o'erweening. Thou well know'st. Oh! were they mine, then would such men, linked in Shiver the foeman's sword, both edge and thrust, Like a mail-coat: this stick against that wallâ See, there the bits lie brokenâe'en so speaks My trust: and that same trust were thoro'-steeled If thou wert one with usâfor such a one Makes many moreâthou'rt young, and should'st be bold And thy warm heart streams swiftly from thy tongue, Stirring dead souls to lifeâso thou art famedâ And Iâno less I've found theeâlessânay more; A lofty spirit towering above This low-lived worldâprone to dare overmuch Than leave undone the least that duty is called By its country's claim. Moreover, thou hast means Such as thy godly function gives to thee, To strike thy stamp upon thy followers, Who hold thee for their very seal of faith; Look to thy likeness for all worthânor own No other witness. Go then, dedicate That function to whose bidding it is due Without all drawback, wholly unto God. So may the Gospel breathe its life again From the dead book it is. Take to thyself The cross of this great trial, holiest (Since He, our Saviour, bent beneath his load) That man hath undergoneâbe thou but oneâ And many others shall make up our host To a full powerâspeeding, like mighty winds, To fill each void. Then shall this land hold up Freedom's fair standard for all folks beside, And our loud blast be echoed thro'out earth With like resultsâKings, at the sound, shall creep Each from his throne, and hide his sceptre away For fear of coming wrath; glad to lose all Beside, and keep his lifeâlordliness, too, Shamed of its silly self, helpless as the owl Sitting abrood upon its addle-egg In sunshine, shall then doff its borrowed shams, Loathing to live aflaunt in tawdriness, Like a crazed jade. âNay, but I'll be a man Among my fellows:â who so death-like dull But feels that freshening spirit, who but hopes That Christian Love may thence become the truth Of its name now? But Hermann, tell me not, The hazard is beyond all reach of hope, The means but straws; and the utmost worth of them To make a forlorn blaze in dead of night, Shewing the pitch of darknessâa short whileâ Then once for all darkly devoured in it. Nayâconstrue me not soârather say thusâ All other means and shifts, manifold shapes Wanting but substance only, have been tried, And trial has still failed, till hope has pined To a ghostâwonder, it were, if otherwise. For the main good thus built on privilege! Aye, yonder mountain set on its snow-peak Would stand as surelyâperish such fool-dreams Henceforth as heretofore. But for new ends Behoves us a new aimâand when old hopes Have been tried thro', and witnessed worthlessly, Then from their shadows, as they fleet away We turn unto the substance left behind, To give it trialâayeâsubstance it isâ God's land is broad, and deep, and strong. Who builds Thereon, nor he nor yet his work belongs To the dream-world. Ho! a new faithâand I Its prophet. Hermann, yes. I am the first To bid the folk; âBestir ye for yourselves: Build your own welfare on your own sure ground.â Leaving fond lies, offspring of quibbling brains To chase each other like the clouds away, And no man heed themâhelping each the wholeâ Scoffing alike that old witchcraft, and this World-wisdom, older yet and crazier. Upholding simple sense alone for sure Truth; leaving learned windings for strait roads. Levelling those rotten walls of privilege That stand in bugbear show, by sufferance, Not their own strengthâalready undermined And crumbling inwardlyâa giant frame Clay-footed; weak, as any wizard's straw To keep the strong man out. This to fulfil Needs only stir the leaven and raise the mass; For what the folk wills earnestly, that God Wills tooâ'tis doomed and done. Thou hast heard all. And are thy ears the portal of thy soul, Or but a sink of waste? so heedfully As thou hast listened to the word of hope Wilt thou drive on the deed as forwardly? Enough of talkâwhy more! a single breath Kindles the aspiring spark, and that same one Blows its dull fellow out; how shall Truth's words Prevail with a sheer worldling; one stone dead To glowing faith and love? Only behold What is before thee: and sure then thy soul Eager as the unwavering wild hawk Will follow on the viewâhonour to thee And thine; and the renowned inheritance Of such a name as history will take Thoughtfully to her bosomâlove and free Welfare for all mankindâonce won, ne'er lost, Blent with the air we breathe. Oh say thou art A man indeed, willing to dedicate Thy soul to such a holiness of aim, Or else avow thyself one of the beasts That perishâborn to fatten, and die, and rot, And so thy duty done. Wellâcome what willâ I too have done my dealâuttered my whole Conscienceâ'tis thine henceforthânor would I take Unto myself the glory and the grace That should belong to thy own forward will By urgency and ondrift more than needs To a free spiritâno, be thou thyself Unto thyself thy soul of enterprise; For other counsellor thou needest none, Being the man thou art. Go, and farewell. Time speedsâwe meet again; but thou meanwhile Ponder my wordsâthen tell me, once for all What is their worth, how in thy scales they weigh.â So spoke the unbending stern Republican, Nor waited answer: but on his last word. Sudden as fleeting ghost, its tale once told, Turned back; with but a clasp of his guest's hand. No other phrase. Man, thro' each shifting mood, Clear or else clouded, gay or sorrowful, Doth to his fellow intimate himself: And sternly, his host's mind hinting his own, And self-collected, so did Hermann too Go homeward his lone way; betraying nought In outward show of what he felt within, But wearing his old wont. Then, as he went, Many unruly clashing energies Forth issued in the darkness of his soul, Like lions from their lair; glaring around, Where, save their glare, no gleam of light was else In the wild waste. Ambition, dreamy and rash, As tho' but needed to stretch out the hand And grasp the stars; showing its glamour afar, Fleeting, and flashy, but yet gorgeous As yonder cloudy ridge, where the sun sets. But bubbles, howe'er bright, must burst: and then, For youth and passion are most swift to change, E'en as his spirit had mounted dizzily, Downward it sank as deep; and on its fall Danger upreared his giant hideousness, Growing in stature like a thunder-cloud, Sudden and strange; till all was darkened o'er, E'en the last star of Hope. âYes, true it is. Ours is a land angels must weep o'er it, And fiends exult: where to make other abuse Tho' foulest, fair by contrast, the rich man By his poor brother pamper'd to pride's fill, Yet robs him for all thanks of half his bread, And then, with that sour scorn, â'tis for thy good This dearth,â embitters the scant half he leaves. Tyranny 'bove the utmost of the Turk To dare it, yet here done by Christian men. Alas! how shall such outrage 'scape the fire It heaps on its own head? and yet, tho' hard, Man must forbear; vengeance is God'sâfor me, Long time I've studied to frame life afresh, And give to manhood rightful self-command. But with fair means and suasive gentleness, Abhorrent from all outrageâwith Truth's light By knowledge lit, burning so heavenly bright, That men must follow it: working its change Most like the sun, with a mild energy, But nothing violentâfor the Lord comes Not in the whirling wind, earthquake or fire, But in the still small voice. So He o'ercomes Evil with good: this ringâthis sealâis my faith's Stampâano catoâmy own words on it, Strong wordsâso I gar'd grave themâbut to me They meanânot upside down, wild anarchy; But Cato up. The strong stern thoro' state Pruner, with sharp relentless knifeâshall clear The excess of rank corruptive growth, reduce Waste to the straitest rule of thrift, and leave None but fruit-bearing branches. Such was my hope. Or if by Revolution I could sum In one full smooth equation a score terms Each knotty, cross, and sorely fought; thro' which Reform, slowly and hard struggling, yet scarce Fulfils man's hope 'gainst selfish hindrances, And oftener is baffled, so 'twere well. But such a swoop as this, why 'tis more wild Than e'er the dreams of lawless wilfulness E'er dreamtâ'tis Satan, the old Anarch, himself. I thought to win by Love, Faith, Righteousness; And what these fail shall robbery fulfil, With rank rebellion? foul the soreâbut no Such rash discharge can help it; true, they're strong, If bulk be strength, the folk he reckons on: So is the sea-sand tooâbut, for it lacks Steadfastness, and hardbound consistency, Men may not build with it. With it, oh no, Nor yet upon it. 'Tis too clear for words. This outbreak for its wickedness must loseâ And even were it rightful, from its own Weaknessâno moreâdie, word and deedâthought tooâ Unuttered.â So his gloom o'erclouded him Awhile, but be the clouds black as they may, The sun will shine again; and all the more Forthgleaming in that dark and stormy sky Did Love's warm light excel in loveliness. It looked upon him like a soft-eyed star Shining alone at night; and well he deemed He could outfight a peril worse than e'er Yawned in the surging wave, or howled in the blast, Beneath the radiance and guiding hope Of such a comforter. They are a pair, Danger and Love, well matched in wrestler's strife When earnest. Sorely then they strove in him. âDost deem me a stranger? Dost spurn me aside? What doubt'st thou of danger, With Love for thy guide? To cheer thro' all weather Thy maiden and thee: Then go forth together, Go forth and be free.â âLook on the clouds embattled o'er thee, Hark to the war blast of the wind. Turn from the raging flood before thee, To the home-peace thou leav'st behind. Gaze on the gulf that roars below, Till dizzy horror dim thine eyesâ For thee and thine it rages soâ Look once, and be for ever wise.â âThat cloud shall pass over, And then the clear sky That its curtain doth cover Shall gladden thine eye. And the flood that thou fearest Shall lend thee its force: Wheresoever thou steerest Still speeding thy course.â âBut oh! the world's a giant thingâ And what art thou to dare its wrath? An atom idly combating, To stay its parent planets path. Yes, when yon shadowy clouds shall grow Into yon solid mountain mass, And shape in stone their airy showâ Then shall thy dreams be brought to pass.â âAnd wilt thou for fear Of the strife may befal, Leave thy hope basely here, Love, glory, and all? My torch's bright flame Shall I quench it in dust? And shall thy bright name Be but canker and rust?â Oh no! thou'rt known and tried: it may not be To speak of baseness in one breath with thee: Such fire as thine, when adverse blasts do blow, Stirred by their spirit all the more doth glow. Why is the young blood warm, its yearnings high? But to dare all, and do what ne'er shall die. Go then, assert thy privilege of youth, Tread down misgivings 'neath high-minded Truth. For see, ambition, love, and earnest hope, All spur thy will, and speed thee to thy scope. What tho' that scope be distant? look and see We love yon sunny hills tho' far they be: We love them more than all we see around: These dreary moorlands, and this marshy ground, Then for thy lifeâits highest worth were thisâ To stake the bubble against lasting bliss. On thenâforthrightânor heed what dastards say, Such fire as thine will ever win its way. And oh! that maiden, couldst thou live and see A bolder rival's love preferred to thee? Bolder than thou to dare and to endure All perils prompted by her soul so pure. That soul so pure as justifies the wrong And sanctifies the right where'er it doth belong. Yes, thou could'st bear her hate, but ah! her scorn! So deemed of her thou wert indeed forlorn. Such were the thoughts, shifting and shadowy, That hope and fear, untoward counsellors, Whispered within him. Toss'd between the two, He went his way, fitful and heedlessly, Deaf of his ears, blind of each idle eye: Bemused and senseless in his depth of soul. So doth the rush of passion overbear From within, outward shapes. Forward he strode Hurriedlyâbut with many a pause betweenâ The bar of some cross thought. Ere this the sun Had climbed the slope of heaven, and seemed there To pause awhile in height of power: as a King Glad to look down on lowly happiness, And feel his warm reflexionâHermann then, Body and soul yearned from the heat to shade, And coolnessâboth he found on a grass-knoll Planted with five small trees and evergreen, Both with their waving full-leaved overgrowth And the refreshment of a hidden spring, That gathered there its waters deep below, And gave that verdant token of its life Unseen but not unfelt. Thence was he wont Erewhile, what haste soe'er might drive him on, To dwell with calm delight upon the fair Landscape that spread before him far away, Far as the eye could reach: stealing its thoughts From the tired mind, and stirring in their stead, Soul-feelings, such as sweeten solitude. There thro' that vale Nature in loose half wild Loveliness, lay awaiting husbandry To quicken her to birth, and the far hills Within their frames her pictured wide delight Confined, where farther had been weariness, O'erstraining the intent eyeâall alike, Meadow and wood, and the clear sky above Was blended in the harmony of joy, Save where, perchance, man's spirit mixed itself To jar the gracious whole with its own grief. Shame on thee, manhood, froward that thou art! Thou, the world's crowning glory, last of all Created, for perfection of the work, Yet oftener dost but mar it. Sad yet trueâ And none more sadly ever felt the truth Than did that lonely lad. The golden light Served but to show his gloom yet gloomier: For the sun makes the shadow. He was wont Oft as his evening duty reached that height, And but an eyeshot between him and home, To stay fond gazing, and send on his sight To gather his first fruits of glad return, And fill his heart. There was each homely thatch, Orchard and garden, and rough fir-stemmed porch, Whereon the climbing rose and eglantine Like wilding flowers upon a village maid, More sweetly showed decking rusticity, There they stood yet, nor to their loveliness Lacked aught but the enlivening radiance Shed over all from the beholder's soul Yearning towards them. Alas! where that should be Was but a voidâa dreary void. There sank His spirit, and in that same drooping mood He laid his weary body down at length. Yes, ye far mountains, ye are still the same: I loved to look on ye in days bygone: But then there seemed a soul within your frame: And now 'tis a cold corse I gaze upon. Nature, a queen thou seemest, and art none. For 'tis not thou, but fancy, queens it still: Thou waitest as a vassal at her throne: And she doth grace thee, and disgrace, at will. Oh! ye fair friends, where is your faithfulness? Yet looked ye, as your love could know no change. But now I seek ye home in my distress: And find ye cold and heartless as things strange. Yes, the soul grieves when pleasure doth depart, And when pain comes then doth it grieve again: But most it grieves, when in the bitter heart What once was pleasure is transformed to pain. And thou too, Love, I chose thee for my light, To be my hope and joy unto the end: Then wherefore hast thou quenched thy torch so bright And art my foe that wert profest my friend? For thou could'st rule me in all amity; Both of the lord and of the liegeman tooâ Then why so prove thy power in tyranny? Harrowing evermore a heart so true. For 'tis no evil for myself I fear From this or other perilous emprize: But that her happiness I hold most dear; Dear to my heart as light unto my eyes. And I could dare all danger to the death. Bidding to fear defiance for her love: But that my spirit inly shuddereth, To send among the storms that gentle dove: Where is no olive branch nor sheltering ark: And but a fearful hope, a lightning gleam To guide our passage thro' the trackless dark, Where life itself is but a wild death-dream. Alas! in loving her that I must hate Duty; and bear my own, or else her scorn: Oh most perverse misprison and hard fate! But come what may it shall be bravely borne. Away ambitionâmuch I cherish theeâ But may not trust thee with her happiness, Honour and Truth, hence I'm atoned to ye, And yield my self-love, since ye will no less. But why, my soul, art troubled? Why droop so? Be holy, earnest, happy. 'Tis God's will And man's whole dutyâwhy distrust it? No All else may stagger. Truth is steadfast still. BOOK IV. So did that youth choose Duty before Love: And so determination drove away The doubts that held him with ungainly check Waveringâfor the will, manhood's life-stream, Runs in its working channel swiftly forth, Or else being stagnant, straightway is corrupt To births unwholesome and dank noisomeness: New fangling the one healthy life it was Into a thousand most brain-sickly shapes, That live, but in such hideous kind, as death Were welcome to outdo themâ Awhile that lone Stripling, as a stranded ship, lay buffeted By fierce conflicting waves, helpless to do, And dreeing all the more. But as that ship Thro' lustiness and manhood of the crew, Sudden, by a strong effort hard, 'gainst hope, Uprising from her sunken bed bears up, Stemming the surging breakers, boldly ahead, And overrides each billow, like war-steeds, Snorting and foaming: while the winds must miss Her wreck, but fill her sails and swell her pride With power triumphantâthus it fared with him, As in his wilful mood he started up And went his way. âThere is my goalâmust on To reach itâleaving all, e'en Love itself, For conscience's sake.â Happy the man who knows The holy comfort of a righteous willâ To be for once, and oh! if once for all Godly and true: to strike as angels do Straight to their aim, and embassy of good: And feel the while an angel's spirit and wings Speeding our way: leaving far down below The mazes of this world, for the clear path That conscience rules, and keeps it steadily Without all fear, by Faith upholding her, But wherefore talk to worldlings of such bliss As but God's children know? or show him pearls Whose soul wallows in mireâgrovelling there For all that it believesâswine-like beliefâ And such is natural man. Sure he who erst (As poets tell, fabling, but truthfully,) Stole fire from heaven to animate our clay Was but a scanty thief; who, having spent His daring on that danger, lacked at last The wit and will undazzled to behold And readily to grasp the prize he'd won; But fled, dispurposed by preposterous fear, Leaving his work undone; and bringing down But some sad ashes where true fire was dead, And only a scant lingering lukewarmth O'erlived to be our soul. Else had that fire Been but itself, true to its godly source, How holy then were man? Surpassing all That his hope now aspires to or heart feels, Far as the sun that glorifies our heaven Excels the marshborn foggy meteor. But truly whoso first devised that tale Told it not for a memory of things done, But for a hope of what remains to do: That so regret of an old dream might stir A new desire to compass the thing dreamt: Hinting to Nature what she needeth most, Not what she hath: that man, so stirred, might rise Godward, all selfish lost in that sublime, And get the spirit he lacks; by exercise Of heavenly visions high contemplative, Such as draw down, communing to and fro, The holy flame to his soul; the flame that erst Prophets, and patriots now; else a dark death Foredoomed them: for themselves and all their hopes, And the commonwealth of man. But why such waste Of wholesome words? sooner shall this dull earth Which, as born thence, our being doth partake, Stay its unresting and most eager whirl To listen the high spheral harmony; Than man, in moil and hurry of this life Give wisdom, between whiles, hearing and heed, Tho' but to read her writ and show her seal; His stamp from whom she came. No, each man treads The track his fathers trod ages bygone; Till deep and deeper to a rutway worn Downwardâso deepâthey see but the dull mounds Cramping them in: there ever at the heels Of their foregoers, driven by the lash Of law, in clogs and shackles of world-wont, They plod their weary life, hopeless, since here Drudgery is endless. Nor once think to hold Councilâand well consider the true chart That wisdom, from her height viewing awide Sets forthâman's will to wisen, and so speed His workâbut thereto needs the reasoning soul And man is mainly brutishâneeds withal For that same soul the mood it seldom ownsâ Such fearless stirring fiery forwardness As shall enforce its visionary right To a realityâHermann had both. But in such wise as hitherto would burn Only within the temple of his mindâ A light to teach his hearers; not to blaze Beacon-like, earnestly, for warlike work, Upstir and outbreak: haply, for he found No field; or else he deemed this drivelling time Hopeless, and waited the high driving tide: Or, if the hour already were at hand Yet must some other dourer and doughtier Fulfil that mighty projectâwhat was he To undertake it? Thrusting himself through The bold presumptuous throng. âCome, follow me, I am your leader:â how put others by Born to the craft, of wilier, likelier skill, Seize this world's steerageâthis huge hulk that drifts Helplessly, aimlessly, with wind or tide; Fling overboard its shamming selfish state Pilots, who mindful only of their pelf, In straits and shallows keep it craftily Pretending hidden danger on each sideâ Then boldly hands to workâand the ship's head Amain, forthright o'er ocean, freely in full Sail, while the baffled breakers foam behind In shallow rage. But he,âsince old world wont Had tangled our State-threads so crazily, Behoved a stronger hand to wield the sword, Must cut the knot. This and the ruinous wreck That seemed to lower from the enterprise On his own home and hers, his fellows too, And followers, his whole country and its hopeâ Rivetted his denialâas right sure That such a project, how true-aimed soe'er, Like a child's silly cannon, must portend Danger to the fool that fired it, not the foe. Thence he sped onward, in more cheerful mood From that determination, all the while Chaunting his hopes and fears, fancies and thoughts In under toneâfor such his walk's lone wont, Conning them so, to leave the Evil One No room. And now his calmness imaged back The landscape's ripening richness, as a shawl Persian or Ind, in soft reposing show Outspreadâwith smile for smile he thanked his God That he could feel the season's graciousness Darkened of late by his soul's cloudiness, Feel, and requite it with adoring Love. And now the air breathed on him genially From his birth-home: he pass'd the village thro', Straggling and far between; broken with wood, Orchard and garden, meadows, lanes, oatfields, Plenteous, nor pleasant lessâand door by door He uttered to the inmates his heart's grace, Prized none the less for its small costâsuch dew Tho' slight, is yet refreshful; so good-will Returns to the giver; and in endless chain, Coming and going friendliness revolvesâ Blest interchange! without it the world's wealth Were but a beggarâthis the old dame felt Basking in the sun beside her spinning-wheel, Intent on work, nor yet so wholly intent As not to greet him coming with blithe looks And bless him leaving: the old shepherd, too, Who best loves serious talk; and she who most Needs it, the saucy maid, pretty but pert: Secure yet how unsafe. All had their turn Of kindly word or smileâso on he pass'd, Gladdening with the sunshine of his heart The radiance of that sweet scene: until, Tho' lingering as loath to shorten it, He reached his Father's house. Him he found there 'Scaped from his scholars' impish noisomeness; Taking his solace in the sunny ground He tilled with his own hands: and tilled it so, That scarce could a born spadesman of them all Better his work. Faith, if he only wrought Those urchin minds withal so winsomely, They pass'd all praise. It seemed some kindly sprite Had taken there his turn as gardener For show of thoro' work. The rounded beds Were swelling to their birth. The stately flowers Rose daintily, as ladies of the soil, Clean from the level mould. The gravel'd path Showed like a golden stream, bright glistening Through grassy slopes. The earth smelt summer-like; The hedges in their shapeliness of trim Were smoothed from their wild growth, with off-set green Against the glittering sun. Thro' the whole space The soul of summer shed its influence And not a weed was there, foully to mar The sweet society of herbs and flowers. Hermann stood gazing not unwishfully And inly thus he saidââOld man, thou'rt blest Both in thy toil and the reward of it; And I, in thy example, were blest too, Did but the sire descend unto the son, As like should beget likeâbut oh, harsh Fate, And harsher Love!â So, as he thought, he paced Evermore on, self-wrapt in thoughtfulness, Till, at his sound of step, the old man turned Hastily, and with like haste, thus began. My Sonâwelcome once moreâgive me thy handâ My own is all toil-stiffened; yet I feel Its stiffness soften in this pressure of thine: Trulyâa glad graspâfor my boys, an hour Earlier I gave them riddanceâbetter so. My wandering spirit, I could but feel it such, Were ill for teacher's taskâbut prithee, whyâ Why art thus late? Ah, wellâno odds of that. Look up boyâa clear blueâand not a cloudâ Would it were so with me: but 'tis the mind Makes its ownâah! you know Milton's wise words. And Iâbut 'tis a darksome tale, unfit For sunshine. Come thenâyonder bench by the brook, With fir-gloom high o'erarched, deep in its death Stillness, be it our seatâthere receive thou The overflowings of my troublous heart Into thy ownâfor much would I fain sayâ Much that unsaid were better for us bothâ If so undone. Hermann 'tis such a tale, As the echo frightens me at every word. Confounding with the fear of what is said All that remains to say: not a man elseâ Not e'en in deathâshall be my trust-fellow Of what I whisper thee: but thou'rt my son, And in that titleâwell, title or noâ Listen; for I must tell thee. Thou hast markedâ For to thy searching eye not even hearts Are hiddenâthou beholdest th' inward man Through show and seemlinessâthat these late days I've beenâwitness me whatâcross as spleen's self. Fickle and spiteful as the winds in March. Some fitâsome oncomeâbe it what it mayâ Unearthly quite. The Devil himself in man's Shapeâand that man her father whom thou lov'st: E'en soâe'en Hess. 'Tis he hath crazed my brainâ Haunted my dreamsâand by some hellish sleight Bewitched me, heart and soul, unto his will: Nay, never fear, for thus I fling him offâ And stamp him downâhis head beneath my heelâ The old serpent, for he tempted meâhow think ye? With what fiend-wiles? whither to follow him? Why to o'erthrow State-rule, law, ownership Itself, beneath mob-sway. Such his game is. And on that game to let his hell-hounds loose, The rabble that he holds in slip: shall scour Earth like a whirlwind, rob, slay, burn, leave nought But reeking havock. Look, boyâlook around How beautiful in plenty is the earth, And how she doth give freely all she hath, All this full summer flush. And shall her sons For the one token of their thankfulness Mar her free grace with war, and brother kill Brother on his mother's bosom? My dear son, Others may marvel at this, if wildest rage In these dog-days be wonderâothers mayâ But I myself who've thought the thingâthe deedâ And sworn an oath to do itâI, alas! Can only wonder at my sinful self; Which, thus, I throw sheer offâloathing its thought Like pested ragsâ'twas only yesternight, Starting from sleep in sudden consciousness. I seared this finger in the burning lamp To try, whether or no I were a fiend, Fire-proofâsuch as my dreamsâah, dreadful! yet why Haunt thee with fancies: hear then the sad truth. 'Tis a short taleâhe came, I know not whence, A stranger, with but scant welcome from me; Until, so wilily he wrought on me, That formal greetings grew to fellowship; And that to friendship often did we meet; Such meetings as, not seldom, o'erlived night Into the following day; and the ember heap Died a cold death while yet our talk was warmâ First of slight gossipâneighbourly surmiseâ Tillage and crops and hapsâmanifold fleet Images, mirror'd in his lively mind From outward show and surface of man's life. Then booksâsoulâmatter. There would I have stay'd, In that safe stay I knew and loved the best, But he would not. Next was Church, State, and Law Searched with unfriendly eyes, tillâhaving tried His ground, and sounded me and mineâso far As shallowness sounds depthâhaving found where My patriot warmth was eagerest, and most Careless of cautionâthence he 'gan lay siege With most deliberate craft, day after day, Against my constancy and wiser mind. Plying all sleight of reasonâhope or fearâ As best might help his turn: stirring my bile By presentation of the parson's tithe, Beggaring my scant fare: puffing my pride, Praising my learned proof: stuffing me full Of perilous conceits; until my mind, Like to some fireworker's accursed shell, Crammed with all havock, waited but a spark To burst amain in spiteful recklessness, And wrack all round it. But the screw wrought slow That wrung me up thus to the topmost round: No spring, but many steps. So, like a dram, I sipped my danger: at first loathing it; But, after while, needing the poignant fiend, Whom bosom'd once, we hardly banish him: Such a regretful thirst he leaves behind, Unquenchableâwith ever zestier stir Hankering his recall. Thou know'st me well, My words, my thoughts, all my behaviour, For years bygoneâso thou'rt aware that he Spoke ever, to my mind, truest and best, Who spoke the level folk-right uppermost, And priestcraft lowestâhigh church downâlow up. How, when our parson, most ungospel-like, Would grasp his flock, not with a helping hand, To guide them, but to bleed and strip them bare, Then did I give my counsel, hand, and means To the revolters, and stood there foreright, Braving all chance might come: and such a dinâ Ah, yesâthe peal I rang startled them all, And frightened himâthis thou canst vouchâand hast This pledge, that all I've done, aye and forborne, 'Twas the main welfare prompted meâthat ground Here failing, why, I'm freeâso, for my faith, Be the past a token for the time to come. Now, look, my son, how Heaven o'errules man's craft To trick itself. He lured me ever on, Giving the promised glory all to me. My little meansâpuffing them mightily, For his main endâwhat I could do myself, And how draw others on. Sure, if I would, To be the foremost man of allâthe head To the huge body of our enterprise: And, truly, had he holden that first aim, Then had he hit the mark: and the old thrall Wherein this land now dotes so drowsily, Were but a dream: then had dead things sloughed off, And a new life come onâa quickening Dawn, on the ashy dulness of that night, Bright as a beacon blaze: to be caught up, And sped around, till e'en the starry sky Had marvelled at earth's brightness. Trueâmost trueâ I only, of all men, bore in my brain The seeds of human hope and happiness: Sure in that soil to flourish and bear fruit; Aye, and as sure, elsewhere, in the slight sand Of other souls, to give but shallow growth, Withering awayâbut this truth, howsoe'er Wholesome, stirs bitterly other men's bile, Those most, whom most behoves to welcome it: Therefore they love it not. Yes, boy, that man Whom it was Heaven's own will that I should lead, And he but follow meâthat clownâthat Hess. What think you? Why, when late I claimed my due, What did he, but half chiding half scoffingly Open strange eyes, and lend a wondering ear To upright Truthâliking full well my work, So 'twere mere task-work to his Lordship slaved, But never to acknowledge me his head, And hardly e'en his helpmate. Why, that dolt Were best befitting, over the rear rank, To drive the hindlings onâa loutâas raw Compacted as the clay that fouls my feet To tread on itânice difference he knows noneâ Laughs at book-loreâand he forsooth must beâ Will deign no lessâour leader; must rule all, And some would yield it him. Well, let who list, Only not Iâsooner shall yonder stream Run in yon ditch, than I follow his lead, Save for his downfallâand what, thinkest thou, Doth he first purpose? why, to beggar us, To make us outlawsâstripping off the old Protection, whence this garden, orchard, field, Requite my toil: for the mob's sake, and cheap Outlandish bread, which if they got, they'd so Glut, with such grace, as swine o'er their mast-fall And acornsânow being dear, they know its worth: And better soâmuch better careful dearth Than thankless riotous plentyâthen for his crown, His fool's cap, our new templeâman's main hopeâ On the old rotten rubbish he would build On it, nay with it: clothe his mannikin In the offcast Christian cloakâin Gospel faithâ That cloak so threadbare worn, that every eye But the blear dotard, sees through its flimsiness, Clear as the light: lasting but from disuse, Like an old scutcheon; falling to dust When handled. What! cram down our throats the stuff They've loathed so long, and bid us thrive by it? Nay, rather to the Gipsies for my faithâ To the relic bones for worship. Heaven saveââ âO yes, my Father, Heaven save us both,â So Hermann broke upon his words, âfrom such Utteranceâfor its feverish wild heat Doth but the more chill me with shuddering fear For the issueâtoo outrageous are thy wordsâ Their reckless wind blows deathâwhelming downright Where it should waft along. Nay, breathe not aught Of our religion save religiously, For all the evil thou can'st say of it Doth but enhance its holiness the more, Being, in truth, but black detraction Flung on a field of snowâshowing what's fair, More lovely 'gainst the foulness of its foil. Father, I owe thee muchâmy lifeâtho' that Is little, if unworthily it lives, And thus I would requite thee: Come and share This godly comfort with me if thou wilt. Cherish this Faith, wear it and walk in it As a white robe that beggars all things else, Even the highest-plumed kingship and pride Below an offcast rag. But if thou'rt slaved Out of thy loyalty unto our Lord Into a harsher bondage, hard to bear, And hardest to shake offâan iron yoke 'Stead of the Grace should guide thee: if such thou art, But oh! Heaven grant theeâgrant us both alikeâ To be far otherâthen I ask of thee What thou art nothing harmed to allow, but I Happy to hold itâleave me then at least, This faith which is indeed my soul of life, And take away whate'er thy bounty gives To eke my scanty means: for all else lost Enhances the pearl left. Behoves us not, Father and son, to wrangle with fierce words, Therefore whate'er within I'm stirred to say, I set the seal of silence on my lips; And ohâdo thou the likeâto other ears, As to mine own.âForgive me, oh God, that I Contend not 'gainst my sire on thy behalf; And thou, much more, my sire, forgive me again, If I forsake not God and God's own Truth To follow thy stray will. Thou knowest me nowâ Would I could know thee too, not as thou speak'st, But as my will would have theeâso wert thou Renewed in happiness; and I, how blest, Sharing my Faith with thee!â âWell, as thou wilt; 'Twere all as hopeful to go teach the wind That bloweth where it listeth, as thus strive To free the soul from its self fantasies By Truth. Whoe'er makes Faith his idol, fools His reasonâgo thenâgo drink hellebore, And purge the bile that so beclogs thy brainâ So dims thine eyes. Clear thy own mist away, And then thou wilt be early all enough To show others the Truthâso much for thee. Now, for myselfâmy purpose is fast stakedâ I leave yon crafty madman and his crew, As I've good cause: first, for his wiliness Taking from me the sceptre of leadershipâ And tendering me then a staff, a flailâ To handle in its steadâsuch a dull thing, As sure the biggest bumpkin would wield best. The clownish weapon of one who hath no head To unthrall his horny hands from drudgery. But this were littleâthen he would foresay Our free Philosophy and reasons rule, And patch the old priestcraft upâmake man a child. Aye, worseâa drivelling croneâlast, to sum all, The curse of treachery is on his cause, Blighting it, root and branch. Truly, my son, I were the offcast e'en of castaways, Could I hold troth with him. No, my best aim Thus far gone forth with them is further on: Redeeming by new righteousness my wrong, Thro' use of what were sin being employed 'Gainst other men, but godliness 'gainst him, Like a marsh meteor, to bewray them first, Then leave them floundering. Beshrew their hearts, But they shall feel me for their sharpest foe, From late their fastest friend. Oh, could I wring Into my tongue the hate that's in my heart, Each word were poison. Yet, I tell thee againâ Once did I wish them well, and my heart glowed With thought of the upshotâthen I whisper'd thee Some hopeful words, and thou did'st answer me In chilling wiseâthou did'st abhor it then, And now much moreâif thou'rt my son indeed, And not undutiful to the warm blood That did beget thee: or sayâheart thou'st none To feel my wrongsâyet 'tis not mine aloneâ But thine no less. They love thee wellâthat man, And his fair daughterâso thou readest themâ And thou lov'st tooâso loving and so lostâ Fool'd and flung by; seethed in thy own soft milk, Thro' the fond lure that they hold forth to thee, Their maiden's beautyâbut that lure is spread, (For look ye, their kind unreserving will Would see two men made happy rather'n one) To other lusts than thineânay, start not so, Better look thro' the truth with earnest eyes, Tho' it do blast thy sight. Mark them, I say, Mark them: and that young Linsingen, mark him. Needs no more saidâbe not blind wilfullyâ 'Tis but to ope thy eyesâthen what thou see'st, If it fall short one hair of what I've said, Forswear me for thy father, write me down A liar; and the love I forfeited Bestow on them.â He ended so his speech; For Nature failed him; and his faculties Were strained beyond their strength. Motionless there He sate in mere exhaustion, until tears Came to refresh the fever of his soul Parched up by passion. His much wondering son Had watched him thro' the maze of his discourse, And saw the glittering snake fiery and bright, And swollen to the full with venomous pride, Unfold his deep-coiled wily tortuousness, Development most hateful: eager he was To break the treacherous curse threading that speech Ere it had spent itself. Yet he forbore, As having still, even in his despair, A little ray of hope that the end might be Better than the outset gave him warranty; And then those tears, as falling down a face Long wont for him to wear the smile of love, Quite overcame him. He sprang up, and grasped That wither'd hand so warmly, as brought back The blood to the cold veins whence it had ebbed As if to flow no more. Remorse of a sight So piteous had choked up all reproach, And turned his tide to childhood. âMy own dear Father, how much better doth lowliness And such a sorrow as thou showest now Become thy years and their ripe wisdom mild, Than what thy lips late spokeâunlike thyself: Whirling out reason as the hurricane Blasts a torchlight away. Much I do joy That such a spirit is gone forth from thee, And oh! if once for all! That thou dost turn From the steep ruin of this enterprise I blame thee notâbut thy new zeal might give A worthier proof than so to brand those men Whom late thy own sworn faith partook with them. Sir, in plain utterance, that is not well. Nay, rather, parting, tell them thy whole mind: Thy truthâtheir hopeless dangerâsuch kind phrase As haply may yet draw them after thee: That mischief may be curbed by thy rebuke, E'en at its moment gather'd for the spring, And live for likelier aims; but thusâto shape Their drift to ruinous downfall, from the end Whereto ye now stand plighted, each and all: What is it, but to wind their trust of thee E'en as a halter round about their necks, Forswearing faith, twisting the true friends' knot Into the hangman's? Such a thought, if thine It were, 'twould choke me but to utter it: And being doneâbut why discourse of it, As of a thing that hath substance and shape To bear surmiseâ'tis a mere monsterâand so It should be strangled in its utterance Without or name or note: for thy fellows' fault 'Tis only that too hotly they urge on What urged aright were then most righteous. Therefore soft words winning o'er wilfulness Is the fit way to slack their eagerness Not the sharp axe. What tho' they be misled, Men use not to knock error on the head, Should rather breathe thro' it Truth's kindly soul Unto salvation. Father, I know well Thy inmost mind is ever unto good, Yet hath it something now, some wronging mote Withinâthat thou should'st rid forthwithâwill else Harass thy vision sore and spitefully To view all things awry. 'Tis written, Wrath Worketh not righteousness: forgive me then If thus perchance, I show my love to thee In, seemingly, unloving wiseânor hence Misdeem me, to fall short of what I should In thy behalf of duty and reverence, Because I tender thus my counsel unasked Against thy bent of will. Noâ'tis but Truth Prompts me to this sour office, Truth alone, Thanklessânay, rather if hurtless, thankful so. For when the iron is so raging hot, He who would quench it with the cooling stream, Let him bewareâ'tis danger. All I've said, It's sum is short: hold thyself at the rate That others deem thee, who best know thy worth. So shalt thou shame all slander: and whate'er Having well poised the weights, for and against, Thou shalt herein determine were best done, Believe me thy true son: will ne'er hold back While thy behest cries, âForward:â daring the height Of the highest undertaking; so much more As the more danger shall frown forth from it. BOOK V. So did the sire and son hold their discourse, Meeting in love, but haply e'er they left Wishing a wider room between their lives For their love's likelier growthâlest having lost Already its main substance, it should lose Even its show, in bickering sullenness, Sinking from chill to coldâmeeting thenceforth As shadows meet, darkly, ungenially, And so pass scowling by. Ah! who can look Upon such passages in life as this, 'Strangement of blood from blood, father 'gainst son, Satanic eld 'gainst youth, fraud against faith; Nor blush for manhood? Ah, man's worshipful grace, Grace or grimace, both worshipful alike! And oh the ape's grin, yet more worshipful And worthier! for it shams no feeling, and speaks No lie; nor slaves itself to any ape-gang In manacled companionship, where each Being bound by such shrewd ties as cut to the quick Whome'er they bind, must bear both gall and jar When his gang-fellow, starting frowardly, Or swerving waywardly from his right line, Or flinging himself foully on the path, Drags the whole chain awry. How shallow then The dreamy Turk, who asked and got that sad Soul gift of insight, to scan thoro'ly Each worldling's heart. Alas! that sight once seen In its fair-seeming whited hideous Foulness, no kindly man would look again. Much rather would he tear the memory From his mind, and fling it back where it belongs To the soul-sewer, unknown, unregister'd. But conscience hath no fellow, save itselfâ Communes with none beside. God willed it soâ Else could belief ne'er beâfor that means love, And who can love what's hateful? drear were life? If man with man were conscious: but now Faith Covers our brethren's sins with seeming worth For charity to cherish. Ignorance Most blissful! for our faith in other men Outwardly working doth reflect from them, Tho' all unworthy, its radiance on ourselves. For godliness and kindness as they work So grow. 'Tis thus Faith leads wandering souls, Others perhaps, howe'er its own, from the world To God, with holy life quickens the dead, Hallows that world itself to Eden, and hearts From fiend to angel; spreading heaven-like, O'er earth: for heaven is theirs who live from it. They, in mean time, the inmates of that house, Were busied with much care: Hermann that morn In tremulous hurry had bidden them farewell And homeward sped. Faith, a short stay, for one Whose heart was rooted there: but why such haste? Was it that Time was slow within those walls, And therefore he would shorten it? or did stress Of needful business overbear his will, Bidding him far away? or did the brow Of that fair maiden frown upon him then, Erewhile so gracious? or the radiance Of one yet fairer did it light his hope Another way? No matterâlittle avails To guess what none may know. Only he's gone: And if that parting hour to him was sad, 'Twas tearful sorrow to a softer heart. The careful mother marked her daughter's brow Woefully drooping, and thus asked her why:â âLucy, the sun is golden bright, The sky is azure clear, And all is full of joy and lightâ Oh, be of better cheerâ And tell me, whither hast thou been To catch thy fit of care? For in thee only is it seen, And all is gay elsewhere. Prithee, is aught upon thy heart? For sure if crosses fall A guileless maiden as thou art, Should tell her mother all.â âMother, thou knowest all I knowâ I've often heard thee say, There's many a cloud that will not go However bright the day. And sometimes we are like to smile, And then to weep again; Unknowing wherefore all the while, In pleasure as in pain: And I felt something of distress; Some dark and dismal fear; And, for I knew it foolishness, I came to hide it here.â âNay, Lucy, hide what else you will, But hide not truth from me: For truth beseems a maiden still, Whate'er the trouble be. For thou hast wept, and in thine eye I see the glistening tear; And when a girl weeps silently, A mother must needs fear. The clouds upon a virgin face Full lightly come and go; But tears, and thine have left their trace, Spring deeper from below.â âYes, Mother, I will tell thee true, And I have wept full sore; And let me weep, 'tis sorrow's due, Or I must grieve the more.â âAh, then thou lovestâsure 'tis soâ For nought but love could bow A pretty maiden's heart so low As thine is bent e'en now; But when did love become a crime? A thing of shame and scorn? 'Twas not so rated in my timeâ Or thou had'st ne'er been born. And other youthful hearts are light, And why should'st thou despair, With brow so high and eye so bright And golden flowing hair? And soon will Linsingen be hereâ And he hath much to sayâ Will sound like music in thine ear, And grief will then away.â âBut he is come of lofty line: And, courteous tho' he be, Yet never can I call him mine: He may not stoop to me. Noânever can he share our lotâ Then wherefore dream in vain? Oh leave me to this lowly cot, And name him not again.â The maiden ceased: the mother looked on her With such a look as thro' the shrinking eye Pierces the heart in penetration keen: Angrily at the first, then earnestly; So to discern by the significance Shown in that proud face, scorning subterfuge, What spirit prompted that unwelcome speech. She feared, for much it had misgiven her (Since her child lost her mirthful laugh, nor spoke Her feelings, only now and then a sigh, Swiftly suppressed, by stern self-gathering will), That there lay something lodged within her heart Too deep for words. Oft had that dame discoursed (For sorrow from its darkness loves to look Up to the slightest chink that lets light in, And with it hope,) of the young Linsingen, His wealth, his youth, his looks, his forefathers, All that commends to man in the eyes of world Wisdom: she spoke; and her fair daughter heard, And, haply, listened; but, it might well be, Felt not at all; or feel whate'er she might 'Twas no such feeling as her mother would. Enough. Her after woes will trace their way Clearer than words. Only thus much is sure. That this most wary mother, knowing well That Love, when scant, is but a beggar boy, And, likely, wretched in his beggary, Wretched the more as waking from rich dreams; This having learned, as trial taught her truth, Not knowingly alone, but feelingly, In daily desolation of her heart; Fain would she compensate her own sad chance With a golden wedlock for her child achieved; Its substance for her child, and for herself, Its rich reflected radiance, happier yet, To be the comfort of her later life. Therefore on Hermann, so bethinking her, Cold was her countenance, as being one Who must win wealth, if ever, by self-will And strength, no other likelihoodâbut then His lofty hopes, o'erlooking his own ends, Aimed mainly at the welfare of mankind, A mark tho' fair, yet barren, cold, far off, As a lone glacierârich with many rills To fertilize and bless the nether earth, But fruitless for itself. From such a man Her eager eyes would turn to Linsingen, As to an angel; should take, once for all, Her darling's hand, and lead her, both but one, To Paradise. Howe'er, to a worthier home From her hard father's house: leaving that house No blank, but a rich blessing in her stead: Not lost, but gained. So did the mother hope: And as she hoped, she trusted too awhile. âFor is not my pale Girl, tho' proud, and oft Self-wrapped in her broad forehead's thought, yet most Gentle, and to my will, as a gentle boat To its own wilful stream; stirring not, save From that stream's influence?â Such her self-sure dream; Else, her lone maiden to choose frowardly, Like any strange wonder, had startled her, Shocking all forecastâ Thus foreweeningly Had she set up her trust for the whole truth; Rating all other unwelcome likelihood At a straw's rate: nor minding that the young Eye, from its rash self-will beholding all, Not with the artifice and glass of Eld; Eager, but inconsiderate of search, Doth oft forerun wisdom with wishfulness, Taking for gold sand-glitter, a wild hope For toil-won harvestage. Such is youth's law. But, for that law is not calf-bound in books, Nor by the crier trumpeted abroad, The hopeful matron never heeded it, When 'twere most need. Yet something, of late time, Had she mistrusted in the things she saw, Watching more warilyâand this out-flash, So sudden, from her daughter's cloudiness, And speechless sighs, lighted suspicion in Where surety slept so longâshe set herself, Forthwith, to wring the spongy secret out; And so had done; for with such hope at stake A mother's head is hard, and maiden hearts Are all as soft: so, what she could, she would, Tho' with it she had wrung the life-blood forth To its last drop. But he, on whose behalf She was solicitous, sudden appeared, While yet his noble name was in their ears, Himself in nobler presence to their eyes, Her life, her joy her own prideâLinsingen. His coming was unseenâbut, ere he came, The watch-dog bayed his welcome: that was enough To hint him near at hand: for the dame's mind With his loved likeness was so wholly filled, That any far slight token seen or heard She had asked, is it he? then were glad looks, And words made kinder than their inhold was, By the heart-breathing voice: greetings and smiles Profuse, as from a mother to her son, Long lost and late restored: high is the worth That such sweet tokens of affection bear; And yet, as Linsingen then reckoned them, One only jewel tear, glittering in the eye Of the soft maiden who stood silent there, O'erpriced them all. That tear rose suddenly From her troubled heart, as bubbles from the wave, Betokening inward stirâbut of that stir Showing no sign, wherefore or whence it came, No more than doth the rainbow. Yet 'twas a tear Such as bedews the burning cheek of Love, And being so, to Linsingen's belief, It was not such alone; but the self-sameâ So Love would have it. WellâHail to thee, Faith, For thou art happiness; thou feel'st in the heart, What ownership weighs coldly in the hand, And he who hath thee is blestâblest against all The world without, as Linsingen was then. For his head, what was it, but his glowing heart, Brimful with its warm flood; and gushing o'er Whither his fond faith willed. Truly could worth Here in this world give warranty to man Of welfare, then his faith had been fulfilled, And would it were! Then Fortune, if for once Her bandage were unblinded from her eyes Could show no surer proof of random luck Changed to discernment and considerate doom, Than by her sanction of a soul like him Crowning his highest hopeâ He was a man Of high nobility, yet simple too, As any lonely loreless shepherd's boy, And careless of self-claims; giving much grace To his high house, but needing none therefrom, As living from that true and inward light Which shames the false: so, in self-stand, he scorned Rotten hearse-trappings of dead mouldering dust, A manly soul, strong in his manlinessâ Prouder without pride's plume. He'd felt erewhile The gripe of neediness, and fought against Her iron claws barehandedâfriends were fewâ Kindred far off, and nature but a nameâ Nor common blood scarce more compassionate Than the cold water of the common pool. So they were nought to him, nor he to them, And in his bitterness oft his heart yearned For the chill blank that Aristocracy Offered him, bloodily to blot it out. So were the world well rid. But hate and scorn Howe'er they nurse them in the inmost heart Keep not the body warmânor drive the wolf From the door. What 'vails, against his spiteful teeth And fangs, to show our own. So having spent His all, save one poor plank to outride the wreck, To that same plank he did commit himself, Swim or else sinkâleaving behind him nought But emptiness for who came after him, And curses for his kinâso he launched forth: Wishing no other terms with those he left, But a far offing: and a little farm That in its littleness had been o'erlooked, When ruin smote the rest, he made his home: Reckless, as any swallow, of the world He left behind: Then he flung clean away The thought of what so lately he had been, As 'twere the cobbler's dream of pageantry; And that high flying spirit now kept wing Evenly, with this new life's lowliness. Thus his safe level he found; and having thrown His silly foolish lendings off from him, 'Stead of the puffy feathery things he was Stood up, a stalwart stripling. Thence, unthralled From idleness, and highborn beggary, He found his loss the greatest gain of all, From follies clear'd, a fair free opening field. Aye, and no lack of wholesome growth, from farm, Orchard or garden; till he came to love That boor-like swilth more than his lordly fare; Since truly earned by toilânor yet his sports Did he forego, nor pastime, wont of old, But what was then a spendthrift gulf he made Gainful, with gun and dog ranging his fields While overwatching his hired hands withal. Thence striding often straight away to the wild Neighbouring moorlands, trackless, boundless, bleak; No trace of toil, nor token of ownership: Unhindered, thus he followed, year on year, His wilful way, tillâa most luckless timeâ There came among the mountains a strange man And claimed them to be his. As the babe cries, âMy toy, give me my toy;â for were they not As truly now and lawfully his own As they were once God's who created them? And he was asked, how were those mountains his More than the sea or sky, who ne'er had tilled, No, nor e'en trodden them: and then he showed For all his answer an old wither'd skin O'erwritten with strange words: some wizard sure Had traced them; for âhere,â so he said, âI hold In hand, aye in these sheep-skins, yon whole ridge Of mountain, east and west; yes, these are those, And those are these; three skins cover them all, From the whole world to meâwho says me nay, Better in words keep his denial close, Nor act it out.â All this to Linsingen Seemed idle, as a drunken dotard's dream, Nor better worth a thought: so on he held, Heeding no more such stay than a witch's straw To bar his pathâbut danger, when least deemed, Her deadliest weapons oftentimes doth wear (Even as Treason hath been crafty mad,) 'Neath an uncouth disguise. That owner's ill Words ripen'd to worse deeds: for wilfulness, Whate'er it doth for pleasure, suffers more In pain. The law, which slept not, tho' for years It seemed to sleep, sharp as a snare of steel, And subtle, caught him in the open act And held him fast, spite of his hands and teeth, Till she had wreaked on him her uttermostâ A galling shackle; wrung him sorer yet Striving to rid it; vainly, what he bore: Ill, he must rue the worseâand the after-thought Was very bitterness. So did his pride Beget upon his hate a hatefully Proud issue: and the old disdain, that stem Of evil, that was slowly dying out, Now, pruned by the law's knife, sprang up afresh With many shoots. Sad upshot! for thenceforth He mated him with reckless fellows wild, Whose deeds were not of day, but such as gave To night a darker shadow than its own: Poachers on river, over moor, in wood, As chance seemed likeliest; smugglers, or they Who share the smuggler's risk of loss or gain; Selling uncustom'd wares: those and the like, With wilfulness akin to wickedness, He took unto him, not for their own sakes, But for they outraged those who hated him; Whom yet, as a good Christian, he should love, And would he hadâbut did notâ So he lived Awhile; and all that life was broken law, Confounding rule with riot; bursting bounds, Daring the worst of danger, day by day, Till daring became feverish hankering thirst, With danger for its dietâso high-strained Is but short-livedâoutrage and penalty Crossing so often must needs meet at last: As he ere long had felt. But Fortune's sun, Suddenly shining, cleared his outward cloudâ But not his own worse vapours from withinâ However, luck befriended himâif that Be friendly to pour down on him a flood Where only showers were needed. Such a gush Of wealth, so strange, as hurried his life-stream With swirling glut to overswell its banksâ Nor did he long contain himâfor that turn Of fortune turned his thought and working will From his late wont of riotous recklessness To a stern earnest aim. âThis wealthâ'tis mineâ How best avail it? as a lever, so To raise me to their level?âah no! in hate I left them, and in hate must turn on them; For this new hate is bitterer than the old, Since it hath better means to wreak itself. No, then; this leverâ'tis to overthrow, Not raiseâo'erthrow their prideâthen huddle them Aheapâand tread them with their frippery Of straw and feather in the main mixed clayâ Make bricks of themâah, good!â So all his means, Friends, talents, time, and utmost faculties, He flung them, coldly, in that darkling gulf To swell the flood. Such was the man, who then Left Treason for awhile to follow Love. âWelcome, honoured ladies dear, I have sought ye far and near; Orchard, house, and garden round, Sought ye far, but nowhere found. First they said, in gipsy mood, You were wandering thro' the wood For wild strawberries and flowersâ There I lostâhow many hours! Nextâshould find you without fail With th' old widow in the vale. Thenâbut endless 'tis to roamâ Happiness is here at home. So, I greet ye, ladies dear, Your true knight, befal whate'er, And my page doth follow me, Childe of donkey chivalry, Spurring without fail or fear, With banner'd, noâbut panier'd cheer. Wine and wassailâbut to me Slight their worth to what I see, Lucy, that fruit, found by theeâ Gather'd by thy handâyes, thineâ Take all this, but that is mine; But, 'tis time we should be gone, See, the hours are speeding on, And the sun and summer sky Speak more winningly than I. We shall find our baskets spread There by the lone fountain head: And this pony, safely tried, Lucy, 'tis for thee to ride: Only let me be his guideâ Thine tooâand ere the close of day This one guerdon wilt thou payâ As we go, of hill and sky To ask their hospitality, Playing so the gipsy's partâ Look thou prove their witching art. Read my Fate, my Fortune tell, For thou only hast that spell. With the yet more happy skill, To frame that Fortune at thy will.â Gaily he spoke, yet earnestly, to both Aloudâbut his heart's feeling to his own Dear maiden's ear. Yet had he put those words Into a trumpet blast, and sounded them Till echo's self were stunned, not so had he told His tale more clearly to the matron's mind Than by that soft suppression; that betrays Thro' silence, surer than the shrillest sound. The love that thrills the daughter's heart, gives too Some token to the mother's head, that what One feels the other knows. That chord outlives The severance of birth, binding the two By consciousnessâcommunion, happy indeed Where mutual wills meet in one kindly bond With common knowledge. Else, if they stand off, Sundered, as oft betides, and wholly averse, Most comfortless. Oh Love, where wert thou schooled? Who taught thee such a stretch of tyranny, That thou must brag thy strength against their tried Kindness, before whose wiser eldership That strength should bow down, and forego itself, Biding rebukal. Wherefore dost set up Fathers and dearest friends, to stand for foes, Only to strike them down? Vaunting thyself Therein most wantonly, where pity were Indeed but Nature; and the unnatural Only are pitilessâpluming thy pride E'en with those tender plumes which the parent birds Plucked from their bosom for the homely nest Which thou dost scatter in airâavauntâaway. Ere this the sun was high, and the time ripe They should go forthâso forth gaily they went, The mother and the daughter, lover and sireâ One kinâif minds alas! were kindred tooâ With them the old serving-man, grafted, years back, Upon their stem, when the sun shone on them, And growing evermore, weather alike, As there home-born. Nor went they all aloneâ For kindness loves communion of its joy; But with them from their neighbours' friendly homes Three merry village maids pranked in their best, And five stout lads, unfashioned, yet with hearts Warm as the ruddy colour of their cheeks And manhood all as true;âbrothers, or yet Dearer to them than brothers, for love's sake. In faith, a joyous train: enough of glee Already to fulfil their holiday Tho' it should bring none else. So they sped forth Afoot, astride, or on the panier'd ass Chancewise, blithe caroling: a motley throng As the outlandish gipsy wanderers Shifting their tawny canvas, ever on, With careless change. âMy friend,â cried Linsingen, Shouting above their jovial noisy talk; â'Tis mirth is now the matter of our day, And music is mirth's kinâbut music self In these wild hills would hardly know itself If the harp were wanting. To the harpers, then, 'Tis but a short while round, and heâhis worth Hath earned us all, right well.â So said so done. There lay the hovel in sight, and soon their speed Had overrun that space. The greybeard sate In his trim garden, glad of the sun's warmth, Vital as to his flowers, so to him, In his chill years. He heard their mirth afar, Strangely, for mirth and he were strange long since, And wondered what it meant; nor wondered long: For Linsingen, forth spurring, in few words Spake his kind wish, and the old man answered him. I âYes, gladly will I go with thee: For, Master, thou art dear to me: And be it sun or be it snow, With thee full gladly will I go. II For ever cheerly do I play, When thou dost listen to my lay: And there my fancy's liveliest, Where thou art bidden for a guest. III For thou art come of high degree, A royal spirit breathes from thee; And lines of kingship I might trace, Ere vision failed me, in thy face. IV Then on that face I loved to look, Like one who reads an old-world book: And now I love thy voice to hear, It tells old histories to my ear: V And be the strain whate'er it may, Ever thou feelest as I play: For thou hast fire within thy heart: But others are not as thou art. VI Noâfor tho' many a one doth call The lonely harper to his hall, That he may be a stranger's show, Yet, Master, am I loath to go. VII For 'tis not that they love my skill; But their pride wantons so its will; And they would welcome all as well Some trickster with his wizard spell. VIII Nor e'er, as they sit idly by, Doth the fire kindle in their eye: They would but mock the gifted glance Of the wild spirit in its trance. IX For, tho' such tale be strange to tell, I know it for a truth full well: There dwells a Spirit in these strings, And when I strike the Spirit sings. X It singsâand if the guests among It find an answer to its song, Ah, then, how raptured is the lay! Else must it sink and die away. XI And when it dies, then all is dead; My heart within me droops to lead: My fingers, like the idiot lad, Play idly while my heart is sad: XII Yesâin the corner be it flung, This harp where hearts are tamely strung: For sooner fire may live in snow, Than Harper breathe his spirit so. XIII Oh, then my soul was blithe and gay, When Honour spirited my lay, And every silver piece I told Was changed by courtesy to gold. XIV But I am not in honour nowâ And thou my harpâyes, even thouâ In my disgrace must bear thy partâ Oh, shame on them who scorn our art. XV Their largess is a very lossâ Their choicest gifts to me are dross. For poor I am, yet proud of soul, And brook but ill their beggar's dole. XVI They flout me like a crazed old wife, For my attire and wandering life: Sure I were better in its stead To break my harp and beg my bread. XVII Oh gentle Sir, thy heart had glowed To see our festivals of o'd A hundred harpers in the hallâ And I was crowned the chief all. XVIII Now perished is the dyke should be 'Twixt clownish men and high degree: The nobles cherish us no more Than did the dullest churl of yore. XIX Nobleâah noâfor they are goneâ And only churlish blood lives onâ And men who know not their own sires Now lord it from their furnace fires. XX Our breezes speak not of their fame; Our mountains answer not their name: In blood and tongue and spirit strangeâ Oh what sad chance hath brought this change? XXI Nor love they mountain, tower, or rill: Nor heed they of the harper's skill: And tho' they prized it e'er so much, Yet not for them were its true touch. XXII Oh for Llewellyn's stirring strain, To wake the dead to life again! A Spirit starting from the stone, To rise and strike and seize its own. XXIII And kindle patriot souls like thee, To bid their Fatherland âbe free,â Free as the burst of my own song; As yon wild torrent pours along. XXIV Then, tho' that sight were doomed for me, The latest of my life to be; Welcomeâfor gladly would we die In that heart-glow, my harp and I.â The old man ceased: and as speech failed, his tears Like a soft shower when the gust is stilled, 'Gain filled his furrowed cheeksâgenuine tearsâ Not such as dotardsâbut a heart-fresh spring, Forth from the smitten rock. His listener Stood fixed in wonder how that mouldering stem Should beget leaves so green: had hearkened him Thro' all that fitful outbreak, wilful and wild, Nor hearkened only, but the truths he heard He felt them, as their woes had been his own Stamped on his heart. There is full often a soul In silence, and the words that feeling speaks Are quick and penetrative thro' and thro', That the heart thrilled by them, answers them not Againâno outward answer, but as true Kindred, without all question takes them home To con them there withinâso silently Surrendering itself to sympathy; Felt but unsaid. Conception hath no voice, Nor senseâa life-shoot only, sudden and strange Striking throughout. Thus Linsingen spake not When that outflush of warmth flooded his soul, But inly brooded allâhow his high birth Might further his high ends: for it behoved His fancy such, and his ambition moreâ If hope should e'er bear fruitâ But time is swift; Too swift for lingering dreams. Then Linsingen, Ere their dim wings had quite o'ershadowed him, Scattered them with a start of energy, To flee amain, like ghosts at the cock-crow, Betokening day astir. He clapped the hat On that grey headâhanded the staffâthen all Forwardâthe young o'erbrimming with their glee, The old rejoicing in their children's joyâ That kindly source, oft the lone one, that springs In Eld's dry wilderness. Sweet was the scene As they streamed onward o'er the russet hills, Those hills that smiled in sunshine, a warm smile Of welcome. All beheld, and all were pleased: Some that they felt sorrow more soothingly. And other some, pleasure more pleasingly, For Nature, like the holy mother, looks Upon her children with a tempering look, Calming all passion: and whate'er they feel, Subduing it to take a milder tone, Whether of joy or grief: still doth she show Some soul of sweetness in her saddest hour, Some shade of sadness in her sweetest smile: As knowing all must fade, how bright soe'erâ Fade and then flower afresh. Thus they went on, Now in strait thread, now winding it, far round, As the hills opened or else barred their way, Nature's stern warders; following here some wild Swift stream, tho' wayward, yet a cheerful guide; There toiling up the steep, painful and hard: Doubtful of footing, and that footing lost, Sure of a headlong ruin, deep below, Thundering down together, horse and man, Crushed into one. That height, slowly attained, With many a suspiration of hard breath, And aching bones, straining on sullenly, âFor why should we be tasked so toilsomely In such unwonted wise of holiday?â Then would they halt awhileâhalt, and look forth Afarâbeyond distinction of the eye; Till dimness brooded under the sky-line, And the end confounded all. Towers and spires Looking in grey and mournful constancy O'er the bright corn-fields' changeful livery; Ruins mid Nature's ever-living green: Wide waving forests frowning o'er the whole. Orchards and parks, homesteads and hazy towns, Scattered abroad like ships in boundless sea, Such tiny motes as seem to magnify The main. They looked, once and again; then turned, In the eagerness of other gazing eyes, And fellowship of gushing friendliness To find fresh buoyancy and sparkling will For fresh delightâlike a tired thirsty man Drinks from the spring, unsparely, draught on draught, His much demanding more. The air of the hillsâ Or Heav'nâfor born between, it partook both, Coursed like an elfin spirit thro' their blood, Playing its frolic fancies on each brain, Witching each heart; till merriment o'erflowed With its own foam: they laughed and clapped their hands, And age was youth, and youth was boyishness, Bubbling and frothing in wild revelry, As erst at its springhead. So fared they allâ All save that pensive girl. Young Love, men say, (But all such sayings mark but each one mood Of manifold swift-fleeting fancy) is shy And fitfulâwild as the windâdashing sunshine With tears, and with bright hues, drawn from the two, Spanning both sky and earth; winding his course Waywardly; mocking his own end and main Will, with bye-aims and off-start wilfulness. Such, then, was Lucy's moodâas her mother hoped, Fondly; for sagest surmise, hope or fear, Love fools them all. They tarried there awhileâ Long while, yet short, since winged by gamesomeness: Until their frolic from its zesty height Sank down, self-spentâonward was then their wishâ And peering eyes looked o'er the beetling cliff Which way were likeliest: warily then They tried each foothold on the nether steep, Oft shifting th' unsafe trialâcraggy heights Have craggy fallsâambition drudges up With yet worse danger down. So envying The bee his humming-winged security, As from heath-blooms his honeydew he sucked, They stepped from mound to mound, from stone to stone, Or where green hussocks seemed to meet their tread, Springing from pressureâor the bushy when Gave a hand-grasp, where else the turf, tho' soft Yet slippery, had played traitor to the foot, Beguiling with smooth show. Love is himself Then most, and then his spirit most a-glow, When he hath charge to watch o'er loveliness And ward all harm from her. Then is he swift As his own shafts, sportively glancing here, And gleaming there. Then, too, most beauteous Is woman's beauty, and her grace shown forth Most gracefully, when like a dove she flies To the warm bosom she hath chosen her For trust and for home-shelter. Laughter and screams Confounded each with eachâthe sudden shriek Belied as suddenly in mirth, and shouts And frolic fun: as tho' the merry sprite Had taken them for playmates of his own, And flashed upon them on his bright-hued swift Rainbowâsuch glittering gladness was shed through Their souls. So they sped down, here scrambling, there Sliding the easier slopesâat the hubbub wild Hushed was the stone-chat, as by hawk o'erhead; The lark shrank low, and trusted not the air Frenzied so strangely. The old shepherd-dog Astart, sprang from his lair, pricked his wild ears, And watched with muzzle keen and keener eye, Low growling at the throngâwhat may it meanâ Some fearful stir, or idle foolery, A noise or an alarm? There stood the flock Thick huddled, broad black heads gazing aloofâ Weighing each fit of folly and merrimentâ In their sage scales of doubt. Now, o'er the dank Morass, they picked their path, and the steep hill From haughtiness began to condescend Toward the level; in like grade their course From cripple and halt ran out into a race Of easy smooth descent. Onward they pass'd, Their shadows shortening now on the hill, Then rippling on the brook; until its shoals They forded, threading next the lovely dale. Thence, sudden, at a turn, young Linsingen Waving o'er head his hatââLook, there it is; Ten minutes more, Lucy, we're homeânay then, Say me not, no: What wilt thou wage?âa crown?â A kiss?ânay, but forgive me, frown not so, But soften thy brow's sadness to a smile, To greetânot me thenâbut the old Tower.â They looked And saw the spot as their guide pointed it: But such a spot as seemed meeter to hail, Not with uproar and laughter, but still deep Complacence, softly musing. A wood-ring Rounded the hill, else bare; with straggling trees, Stunted, the most, and dwarf, but wearing yet A flushful cloak of fresh rich foliage, Screening their ragged stems: with, here and there, Some few uptowering in statelier growth To crown the copse. A castle, trenched around, Signalled that lovely spot in the yore days With warlike stamp; frowning o'er the landscape fair, Like helm on maiden's brow. But time, allied With Nature and her elements 'gainst man, Had bared those stone walls first to a skeleton, And then mouldered the bones: confounding all Its forlorn glory into one rude heap, To witness, as a shattered trophy, his might To men; but of those thrilling warrior days Leaving the Painter little to record, But all enough to the Poet, who lacks no Monumental mass to frame his images, But shapes dead stones to stately towers again With Theban incantation. A small spring Betrayed by the green life surrounding it, Had slaked of yore the thirst of many a knight That held the fortressânow it nursed the copse And brambles, that o'ergrew trenches, mounds, slopes, And harboured the shy hare: 'mid primroses And cowslips, blending spring and summer in one, With the soft sweet suffusion of their hues And their breath's melting fragrance. There they met, Sweet trysting place: they and a fellowship Of true like-minded friends from far and near: Good cheer and luck and gladness to them all. BOOK VI. Nature they wrong thee much, and they wrong Truth, Who from the name believe thee but to be The birth of things, the God-given world-lifeâ Nor feel in thee, beside that teeming power, God's graceâthrough goodly work betokening His gracious will: they wrong thee who doubt this, And wrong themselvesâforsaying all thy soul Of goodness, breathing forth from thee to them. For Truth and Calm, and Love and Happiness, These are thy inward spirit, as the world Thy outward workâthat work is wrought in their Spirit, and whoso loves thee feels them all, And is beloved by themâhappy whoe'er! Happy in what he is: and happier yet In what he hopes, most happy in their sad Contrastâthe worldlingsâwho resemble him least. For they forsake their motherâthou'rt no lessâ A mother worth more than all worlds to him, Whoe'er with child-like heart yearns towards thee. And with the mother's language of true love And kindly looks ever thou greetest himâ Such language as speeds home, needing no ear To carry its sweet message to the soul, But, e'en in silence, saying many things, To flesh unutterable, deep soul-truthsâ Yes, for thou breathest Faith's own spiritâa breath That hallows Earth from Heaven. Yet man lives Of this great good unmindfulâa heart self-sunkâ Soullessâof all above him careless quite: Mire-born, and thither turning swinishly, To wallow. For how else? How should men rise Sundered from Nature, and from Nature's thoughts Atoning him with God? Must so become A thingâdry, spiritless, and deadâa stake Torn from its root and stemâa brandâa dull Stopgap, yearning no more for upward growth Or genial enlargementâwould we then But free our life, somewhile, from artifice, And live as, in old time, our forefathers, Loving the sunshine more than chimney-smoke! Unswaddling us, if only now and then, And breathing freely abroadâas from its nest The unreluctant bird, so we from our home, By reason meant mainly a weather-fence, But made by luxury a prison-house, Where she doth hold us most unwholesomely Shut in from Nature. So is the poor soul Inured to bondage from her budding years, Until she shrinks from the inborn instinct, felt Expansively, in yearning loftiness, That else might swell through the whole vault of Heaven To the poor proportions of a chamber or two: Growing but to the ceiling 'bove our heads And stunted there. What art thou, mannikin? A man? Noâa man-monkeyâwouldst thou try True manhood? strip thy lendings, make thy own Lifeâ'tis most shameful to bemask thee so With its silly sham; made up for thee by cooks, Snippers, upholsterers, gamesters, jockeys, pimps, Tricksters, newsmongersâafter all, thy life Is but one huge and heartless vacant yawn Which they can never fill: leave them their own, Give them not thineâbreak looseâelse will their bonds From silken become steel; out on them allâ Bestir thee as becomes a manâgo forth From the hot stuffy breath of thy house-stoves And breathe free air; till thy fields, watch thy woods, See to thy cots and farmsteads; poor or rich, Help or befriend thy neighbour; above all, Look up to Heaven: the rock whence thou wert hewn, Turn to it, God and Nature: thence become What thou wert meant, and art bewrayed from: a manâ So she first made thee and may make thee again, Tho' strangely now unmade from herâwilt only Unbar thy life and live with her. Needs thus For Lordliness, lest it fall sick and die Of rottennessâmuch more would it achieve Loftier ends. Yesâfor high sentiment Springs not from trivial sights; and godliness Should enter the young soul first through the sense, Dilating so its self-shrunk narrowness By glorious beholdings to become A tabernacle fit for glorious thoughts. Would'st thou then rise to loftiness of soul? Go, live alone with Natureâsome short hours From worldly daysâsome minutesâblend with her's Thy beingâfrom her sun expand thy spark Until thy swelling spirit glow with it. While Pride, to its palace moulded, can but rise Thro' self-conceit, by mirrors multiplied, Up to its hodman's heightâas far below The soul that holds all Nature for its home, As that proud palace to the Universeâ Paltry elaboration. Hast thou a heart? When Nature smiles go fling thee in her arms Like her own child; visit her loneliness; As of a mother who hath given thee all, And asketh in requital but one due, Her children's love. Such due as doth enrich The payer, and as surely beggars him Who would withhold it. Go, then, drink thy fill From the fount springing in that solitude Which, but to barren minds, is barrenness: Then, turning home, bring with thee a large heart, As sure thou wilt from such soul-fellowship, To fill that home with kindliness and joy, And holy comfort. Such had'st thou felt then, (For Nature in her own aspect is best Commended, better far than by fair words) Amid the glories that surrounded them, Those play-mates: theirs the thrill of early day In early summerâfleckered was the sky With clouds light sailing to the brisk cool breeze: Veiling sometimes, and tempering the sun, But scarce obscuring him: from many a blue Island he shed his gentle radiance, Till the air throbbed with living joy. Hill, wood, Meadow and corn, cattle and rivulet, And much beside that language utters not Unskilled of colourâall by the warm light Were blended feelingly to loveliness, Soul of the landscape: seemedâto look on itâ Too heavenly for the painter: must fling by Pencil and palletâfor they could but mar What Nature meant for joy not mimicry. The thankful heart were wiser. As the day, So were their spiritsâbright and gladâwith mirth Quick-gleaming; and their feelings tuned to the height Made music, true, tho' artless, to their souls. And frolicsome blithe talk, laughter and fun, Tho' none had bidden them, came ne'ertheless, To sport on their high tide: surest to come When least solicited. Dance, too, and song Quickened their hours, glancing in merriment Sprightly as summer-fliesâinstinctive joy Suddenly feltâswift fleeting. That old Tower From hollow crumbling ruins, haunt of the owl, And vocal only with his weird night-scream Now echoed, strangely, their shrill holiday, Unwonted: but the shadows on the slope Were lengthening to mealtime, and their keen Spirits had quicken'd thirstâso from the brook They drew them water, making sport of the task, With many a saucy splash: hurry thenceforth Was rife, and busy clatter, cloaks outspread, Service of awkward lackeys, inexpert, Mirth upon strange defaults, strangely supplied, All humours mixed in one, and glee o'er all, Sparkling the surface: but sharp hunger makes Short feast; soon each stiff dish, and dainty slight, Vanished alike, as water spilt on sand, No trace of it. Then rose the spirit of glee: Ever most full in fulness of the flesh, O'erflowing from their mugs. Wassail was King. And healths and merry tales, carousing blithe, Ere drink had tripped their tonguesâ But the Harper old, Slow heretofore and sad to look upon; And while their mirth was fresh, like a dead ash 'Mid the green copse, strange to their fellowship In aspect, and in spirit stranger yet: Now that the fiery mixture of his cups Had blended its rash spirit with his blood, Upstarted into lifeârapt in that hot And heady tide against his course of years Back to his springâof youth and phantasyâ Alas! that he must never see it again, But in the sudden momentary dream, Flashing, as even now, across his eyes; Lighting him up from darkness unto dawn, Wizarding back the dead: so, 'mid their mirth, Sudden, as tho' the spirit of song from high Had stooped on him, and seized his soul entire; Sweeping away with gushy rapturous rush All careful hinderance, and swelling out His breast to such a fulness as bards feel; He caught his harp in hand, and without phrase Or prelude, or one word of preface said, Launch'd forth his spirit on its strain of song. I I love thee well, thou hoary tower, For I have known thee long, And gathered from thee many a flower, And sung thee many a song. II And I have brought my children dear On many a sunny day; And 'mong thy giant bulwarks here, Thou gav'st them leave to play. III I love thee for thy olden fame From darkness gleaming down, I love thee for thy later shame; O'ershadowing that renown. IV I love theeâfor my strength is past, And even so is thine; And thy huge frame is wasting fast, In fellowship with mine. V Yesâdear to me is thy decayâ For thou wert better far To fall downright in dust away, Than see the things that are. VI See the proud stranger hold command Our pleasant hills among; The harp forgotten from our land, And mute our father's tongue. VII Yes, I shall love and cherish thee E'en to the utmost end; Old wont hath made thee unto me For a familiar friend. VIII And I can draw thy echoes out, As none beside me can: Thou heed'st my whisper more than shout Of any idling man. IX For ever I have felt for thee More than my fellows may: So for thy bard thou welcom'st me, And lovest my wild lay. X But yeâthe sons of stalwart sires, From mountain dale and hill; Ye ashes of forgotten firesâ Sayâare ye lifeless still. XI Ah! there's a soul in all we seeâ A spirit in this stoneâ Yon swirling brook runs feelingly But ye are dead alone. XII Yet could but others feel as I, Then surely were it doneâ But ye are many standing by, And I a forlorn-one. XIII Still fain to fawn upon your Lordsâ But dare not to be freeâ Ah, who can say such shame in words? And must it ever be? XIV Then lay it low, that time-worn tower, Nor let one record stand Of home-born pride or home-born power, The glory of our land. XV The glory of our Father's landâ But oh! our own disgraceâ How shall the coward heart and hand Hold such high dwelling-place? XVI Then never harp or harper's name Henceforth be heard again; Too heavy is my country's shame For burden of my strain. 'Tis only the faint spirit that men scornâ Boldness hath ever praise; or, if not praise, Wonder and earnestness, gazing spellbound. And so the old man, albeit of bearing strange, Yet was his strangeness of so high a soul, E'en the clown stooped to him; giving him space And silence to fulfil his glowing speech. Fulfilled, each one upon his neighbour looked, Distrustful of himselfâtill at the last Did admiration murmur itself forth In utterance more soul-like than of words, And all was still againâstillness, not such As throws her cloak o'er inward emptiness; But sheâthe brooding mother of deep thoughtsâ Slow ripeningâand then swift-winged, to soar Abroadâthey knew, by hearing mostâbut some Pledge-bound unto the plot, of straws and sparks; And, deeper yet, of dark conspiracyâ Dagger'd and cloaked and masked: standing await With match in hand to fire the sullen train, Whene'er its bell should toll. Something they knew, And those who knew not all, fancied much moreâ As ever a dim hint stirs the soul through Stronger than full display and circumstance; For day but darkens starlight. Fancy hath lynx Eyes, liveliest in dusk. So their thoughts wrought: And even so their leader meant they should: For thus the leaven awhile must gare within Ere it can raise the lumpâand cleared too soon Is marred for ever; a distempered drinkâ Unwholesomeâracks the drinker. As Graybeard Ended, and overwrought, sate down again, Sobbing in spirit, and half veiled by his harp; His hands mantling his head; sudden there shone A glory from the Heaven, a strange sun-flush, As tho' his blazing banner he unfurled To stream athwart the sky. Sudden it struckâ So sudden, that surprise came over all, Smit by that gleamy shaft: then Linsingen, âWelcome this high forebodal here below! The sun hath shone, and the Harper hath said truth, And light avoucheth light. Hail thou old man, And hail thy stirring skillâtho' 'tis not the harp But the very heart-strings of each one of us Thou hast so thrilled. Long may'st thou live, until Thy patriot hope ripen to happiness, Till this thy land be in full freedom blest, And thou in her! And nowâdrink we, my friends His life and healthâand all his hopes besideâ Both his and ours: aye, and our Fatherland'sâ And as I spill this laggard drop in dust, E'en so be his blood spilt in sorrow and shame, Who shrinks to give it freely and forwardly To the main good. Ah, well! once moreâthat shout Came cheering from the heartâand now, again To our danceâwe'll challenge night a second round, Which of the two flag first.â So much he said: But said not all he meantâfor his mind was To whet their eagerness with but a hint Of his aimâa sudden light from 'neath his cloak Half shown and not half seenâlest, certainty, Should dull the forward will, upbuoyed on clouds, And sinking in clear air. Question he waived, Lest, being satisfied, it should pall soâ But left Imagination there astrain, Its shaft upon its string. Quick at his word That merry throng fulfilled it with a will: And Treason, for the nonce, 'stead of its own Dark windings, tried the mazes of the dance, Open and gayâlight-tripping careless feet For bloody handsâbut from that happy ring Those gloomier few, the leaders first, and then In broken bands, the whole conscious plot, strike off Across the moor, and thence over the hills, Whether for deeper talk, or wider sway For sight. They overtake the ridge, and on, Stalking against the sky-line, giant-like, And ever onâbut why such greedy haste, Baffling the spirit, and forbidding the eye To range at ease? forsooth, such kindly fair Landscape, while man with Nature shall be like, Mooded, and one heart-tie bind mother and son, Were worth a friendlier stayâyet they sped on Darkling, as o'er the heath the scudding clouds, And all as careless of the things they o'ersped. Nor wonderâfor one dour black drop on the heart Upstirred, dims Nature's mirror: inward strife Sees nothing fair without. So forth they fared As tho' the beauty round them were a blank; Broaching their dark designsânor stopping, save When doubt or fiery zeal of gainsayers Drew itself up, or overweening will Would strike its sentence homeâupward or down As wayward hill or moorland baffled them; A course so craggy and untowardly, Perplexed by bog and briar, and yawning leaps, As imaged to the life their purposed aim, Had they so heeded itâomens to read As written. Yet why should they? an' doom write down Whate'er she will, yet Faith fulfils herself, Making her cross her anchor. Ere this the sun, His height o'erreached, and westward course begun, Shot down his fierest shafts. The still air throbbed Visibly in the fever of his fire; And Nature, crouching 'neath the tyrant's rage, Lay like a lark, fearful of the hovering hawkâ No breath, no stir, no utterance.âYet they won Their toilsome way to where a wide pine wood Darkened and shagged the forehead of a hill Else bareâthat wood frowned its defiance forth Sullenly, in despite of the warm sun That made of all the air one brilliant blaze Save there alone. âHark ye, my friends,â said Hess, âYe're youngâthe marrow yet slickens your bones: But mine are hard and dry; rest we then here: The respite that I need, may soothe you too, Who need it not. Here let us sit a-shade, And look into the sun, a luxury Of Nature, such as costliest artifice Were mean beside itâor else onâto the hutâ Ye see it thereâwhere the old fisher dwellsâ He of our brotherhoodâye know him wellâ And hear what newsâwhether our venture yet Be noised abroadâwhat these folk think of itâ Who likely, for or 'gainst.â âAyeâthither on,â Cried Linsingenââbehoves him, who goes forth On such a threatening business as ours nowâ Bestir him early and late. We have a world To win, with only zeal and fiery will To help us win it: therefore, stay not hereâ But thither, where our stay hath likelihood To worthen itâAnd heâI know him wellâ His wish is with us, tho' his strength of arm Be past its working time; and what we need Of tidings true and safe advertisement, If the common eye look coldly on our cause, Or if we may hope comfort hereabout, Whate'er it be, he'll warrantâonâawayâ 'Tis scantly a half-mileââ He had sprung up, And given the example ere his word: Andâforward yetâhis comrades followed him, Drawn in his wake. A stiff descent; half bog, Half briar; then the stream with its log-bridge: These hinderances o'erpast, in miry plight They reached the fisher's home: ere yet within, A ragged boy carried his grandsire word, âStrangers are comeâânor slacken'd the old man To meet his guestsââSirs, I had blushed for shame, But that my shame in sorrow is all lost, To give you welcome in so crazy a hut: I who have oft cross'd hands with you ere now Over the threshold of a worthier house, For guests like youâbut whate'er beâlife's shortâ I am no worse a man burden'd like this, Nor he a better who so burdens me. Time and God's grace will do us right at last, Tho' our own means fail.â âAnd who dares say they shall,â Thus Linsingen broke in upon his word. âWho talks of failure when his hopes are full, With will and strength to warrant them each one To the uttermost? No, my good man, God's aid Is for him only who dares aid himself In spite of dangerâhands we have, and arms, But have we hearts withal for life to them, Or are we but mock-menâmere apesâno soulâ Only in words? Noânot so mean are we. Such mudâso would I stamp it.â The old host Amazed, looked up, and smiled, and shook his head; âAye, Master, youth is warm and full of hope: And once my head, as yours, was golden bright; But Time turns all to grey. 'Tis not my will, But the sharp pinch of need makes me so sadâ Oh do but show me a lightâI'll follow it Thro' fire and water. Aye, Sir, think what 'tisâ To be a sterling householder one dayâ And a gaol-rogue the nextâto be dragged offâ My fishing gear, and all my livelihood First seized before my face. Sheer beggaryâ Homeless and breadless: and not I aloneâ But these poor children too who have done no harm, But to be come of me, that they must starve, And I forsake 'emâNoâbut fail 'em nowâ And leave 'em friendless. Sure 'twere a blest job Could I but dig their graves. Sir, you're book-learnedâ And tell me, is it sinful to wish death, In such a wreck? A sinner! throw that too On the heap of all my wretchednessâAye, boys, Well may you stare; for oncome such as this You never saw in your old grandsire yet. Had fished yon stream for living, scores of years, And nowâgaoled upâfor a poacher.â More had he Outpoured, for anger swept him, with fire-flood, But Linsingen snatched out his reckless flask, And âTrueâwe've all our hardshipsâmore'n enoughâ But we've strength too, thank God, for their redress: And that same strength we're minded to put forth, Each for all sakes. Whatâis't thou only? ah noâ I've borne it and we all, yet worse we mustâ Or this hag-law must lay strong hands on her, To muzzle and gag her. Here, old friend, drink thisâ 'Tis freely born, as free as the hill dew,â No curs'd exciseman for its godfather, But a bold ungauged spirit.âDrink it down, And drink this too.ââDown to such laws, and those Who ever made them.ââOld age is childishness. Unsteadfast, ever like to shape itself To a stronger spirit's sway.â That tottering man Straightway forgot all else, and was full fain To do the jovial bidding of his guests, A changeling to their humour. Much they asked, And heard, and still their bosoms swelled to hear: For he told them how the heart of the whole folk Was like the autumn heather on the hill, Needing no more to burst into a blaze But the first kindling sparkâtheir tide of talk O'er eyes and ears had deepened over them, Unwitting of all else; when, on the door Sudden there smote a strong and heavy hand, That the house quaked to hear. Hermann rose up As it belonged to him, nearest the door, And drew it open. There the old shepherd stood, Shaggy and wild, yet thoughtful of lookâfor broad And lofty was that weather-beaten brow: Stood as a wooden stock grown to the ground Staring his unsaid speech. âSir, from this hill I saw you, so his words at last found way, Brokenly, 'tween the catches of his breath, I saw you, and I knew youâfor none elseâ And down I hurried for such news to tell As never known were better for us both; But Truth must speakâfor she's a spirit of light Speaking, but kept within, a smouldering fire; So you once taught us. Now, Sir, I'll teach youâ Your father hath another kind of faith Than you and I; and what he helped to do, That he would now break up, ere it be doneâ The frame first thing, and then the framer's heads, With its broken bits. For our undertaking, Sir, I know not if ye stand our friend, or if This plot hath reached but to your ear; tho' thenâ These thy mates hereâI understand it notâ But nowâthus much: If ye be one of us Then meet this mischief for the sake of all; Or, if your safety be not bound to ours, But only your good faith; then for Faith's sake, Look that your father do not such a deed As needs must shame his son. He 'th been with me, That I should vouch him before witnesses For the truth of what he said. But I would notâ Nay, rather would I brain him with this crook And be hanged after. Ah, Sir, I'm o'erwarmâ But thou art of an upright spirit, and know'st The workings well of such another oneâ I mean not quite so much. Sir, the folk now Is gathered on yon hillâand the young squire, He and his stranger friend were bound to me, To see me in my lonely dwelling first, Ere they made open meeting with the main. And then I meant themâwhat I've told thee now. But seeing thee one of their fellowship, Methought such hearing were for thy ear firstâ To con it. This, Sir, is my eager hasteâ And now that stuffâsince my heart's light of it, Do thou what needs thereonâSoon shall we meet. Meantime, take home the matter to thy mind.â He spake and went his way: but Hermann, there Stricken with wonderment, stood as spell-bound. Passion oft furthers work, streaming the will, But there it came in such a swirling flood As overwhelmed the wheels it should drive on, Clashing all steadiness. Awhile he stood, Like to a lion bayed by many hounds, Doubtful which first. Then did his vehemence, Wavering at first, self-gathered into strength, Hurl itself, suddenly, all in one stroke, Downright upon its doom. So grew his thoughts To issue, and flashed forth in fiery words. âYesâ'tis e'en soâ The deed is doneâ'tis smittenâthe foul blow. Come then, I know thee well, thou ill-starred hour, Come to thy own. E'en as a reed before thy stormy power I bow me down. 'Tis thy stern shadow that I seeâ It darkens stillâall hail to thee! Hark! I hear thy rushing pinionâ I bend me to thy dark dominionâ Come and sweep me hence away In thy full resistless sway; I am thineâand soâI've said my sayâ Once I strove, but strive no longer, I feel me strongâbut I confess thee stronger. Yet tell me, wherefore art thou so Tricked in hope's delusive show? Ah no! I see thee truly, what thou artâ And lo! my breast I bare: We meetâthis onceâfor never shall we partâ I and despair. And thou hast done all this, my sire, e'en thou! And how could'st thou fall off; oh tell me how? Were it in the face of day, Were it after battle fray, Were it mid beholding men; Better had I borne it then: There is a majesty of might In the full-swaying vengeful sword, But by all spirits, treacherous sleight, But by the Tempter, is abhorred. The rebel may be bold and true, And he may win a glorious name: But Faith forswornâits doomâits dueâ Is shameful death and deathless shame. Oh! 'tis indeed a fortune most forlorn, Where fain we would love well, To feel our love disnatured into scorn, Our heart, our home, turned to a traitor's hell. But noâthou art my father stillâ Duty overbeareth willâ Till the severance of our tieâ Then thou art free, and so am I. Ayeâbe it soâand so be each as free As the sear branch I shiver from this tree. Tear it off and fling it far; To lie wide sundered as we are, Seeâit is doneâ Alas! thou foolâthou'rt still thy father's son. Where then is heâthe friendâ The true oneâfaithful to the end? Seeâhere I bare my armâbare thou thy knife, And coldly drain Each shrinking vein To its last drop of crimson life. So my sire's blood may pour its hideous blot There on that heather, and I own it not. Curse on ye allâye dreams of idleness! I know ye notâback to your nothingness. No! I will redeem the shame Of our foul dishonour'd name. Now that name thro'out the land Is charactered in felon brand; Soon it shall be fair and bright, Written in the sunbeam's light: Uttered in the thunder's voiceâ Hear it and quake, my foes, and ye my friends, rejoice; For there shall live a spirit in that name: Who breathes it forth shall breathe a lightning flame: Strong to comfort and to save, To cheer the faint, to steel the brave. Alike in council and in loud Outburst of the acclaiming crowd: Soul of the battle shout, Rallying here and scattering there in rout. But what strange cloud o'erhung my brow That I was blind till even now? I saw it not, tho' shining there That star-like truth, so heavenly fair. Vain alike were love and hope Pointing to this godly scope; Vain was freedom's thrilling cryâ Each for allâto do or die. Till another counsel came Muttered in my ear by shame; Yes, Honour, unto thee I bow my knee: To outdo the foul disgrace Lowering o'er my name and race. Thy bidding shall be done So be the sire forgotten in the son. Oh yesâa thousand thanks, my sire, to thee! 'Tis all thy giftâthe glory that I see. Not now a vision, but a truth indeed; For Fate's own hand hath written what I read. I see it allâI see the opening skyâ Oh yet one glanceâone moreâenough, 'tis by. But noâthat sight once seenâlives everlastingly. All is one blazing Truth, clear'd to my eyes Of worldly foul foredrift and priestly lies. The giant people, the all-sovereign sun Waked up in glory his glad course to run; Quenching the chilly lustre of each star, That ruled the sky while yet he was afar. Claiming our worship, tho' they shine but so, Their own vain-glory 'mid the night to show; Their glory, and the general gloom of man: But who shall clear that gloom? They neither care nor can. Nor light nor warmth is theirs; and earth and sky Must bide in darkness while they blaze on high: Bide darkling still that they may shine more brightâ Then come thou sovereign sun, and reassert thy right; Give the warm grace those lordly things deny, And bid them fade before thy fiery eye. Fade in avoidance like a flashy dream; They know thy power, they tremble as they gleam. See! darkness faints in day, the pitchy night Bursts into brilliance at one touch of light: And mid that light doth Truth ascend her throne, Beckoning to man, and men asserts his own. Wondering to see, where erst he was so blind, A clayey mass enlightened to a mind. And what he wills that will is now the Lord, And what he says the deed fulfils the word: Despots crouch shuddering down, for he hath drawn his sword. Then doth resistance weakly faint away, E'en as those darksome clouds dissolved in day: Threatening the eye, and thundering to the ear; But to the grasp a foolish empty fear. So right is 'stablished and old wrongs redressed, The few abated, and the many blest. But oh! the joy, the rapture, the surprise, One voice, one will, one world in ecstasies, Ne'er felt by earthly heart, nor view'd by earthly eyes. Yes, 'tis decreed, I've seen the sight, now, forward to the deed! As thus he spake, his glove was in his hand: And, for his spirit so found utterance, He flung that badge of his defiance down So sharp, that the earth rang with the sharp stroke As from a gauntlet of steel; âI fling thee there, Let who will take thee up: from this time forth This hand is bare till it hath done its work, E'en till the crown consummate the work done.â He said, and striding in, thus to his men. âMy friends, the loud occasion summons us As with a trumpet blast: no tarrying time Have we here: up then, to the hills; if aught needs said, We'll say it on the way.â Their talk was then Of earnest things debated earnestly; But such a soaring spirit spake from his lips As overruled them to hear nought beside, Only itselfânone answered him a word: But each man looked first in the speaker's face, Then in his fellows, wondering whence that soul So girl-like, had found wings to fly withal, And to such towering pitch. But the high mind Rules from its height: and so their weaker will Bowed to the sterner sovereignty of his, That they must do his bidding. Forth they went, Leaving the old fisherman to follow them As best he might, in backwardness of years. Silently they strode on, lest a light word Should cross their forward thoughtâwaded the brook; And strained each eye to see their gathered host, Now nigh, but by a ridge hindered from sight; When Hermann, whose hot haste, as goaded on By spur within, his fellows had forevanced, Suddenly turning stayed them, brow to brow, And thus began; fierce and impetuous, 'Stead of his calm deep want. As a stream smooth Gliding, till by some craggy startling edge Confrontedârespite none, nor to retreat, Forthright determined, leaps its desperate doom One flash, one plungeâa foaming cataract Self-hurled; then onward, shooting, sweeping on, RecklessââMy friends, we go, for what? to hear And speakâif t at alone, 'tis someânot muchâ But why not more? Say then to strike. How then? Good faith, that latest word pleases me best: For sure it speaks a strong and daring sense Akin to our spiritâayeânow ye wonder me; And reason that ye should. Ye see me changed: E'en soâwhat late I was, ye knew me well; But nowâye look upon another man. A change that needs no maskâfor it turns not On self, nor sneaks, nor skulks, but looks to the cause, The good cause onlyâand nowâI tell you allâ The sum without the account. For we stand here On the sword's point, and reason is, our talk Should run no wider range. We are betrayedâ Nay, start not, for the danger of that word To meet it, needs stern willârather must strain Our nerves and knit our brows. I say, betrayedâ And who hath done it? Nay, ask me not who, Lest the name choke me in the utterance; Only thus muchâI will atone the deed With all my utmost means, and blood, and life, Being his son. But mark me this, my friends; Doubtless his aim is level to his end, And we in dangerous range: but to that end Behoves a twofold treason, he 'gainst us, And we against ourselves; if we flinch nowâ Then were we all as well each man of us To make a halter of his handkerchief There on that tree. But we have hearts, I trow; And there's no spell can bind us to sit still While the headsman whets his axe. Then what more needs? To the cannon's mouth and slay the cannoneer With match in hand. Go, play the devil at brag, Outbrave each danger, and o'ertop it still With a yet louder and more daring one. Else must we die the death, as traitors' ta'en With sword half out of sheath, short of the deed, But far beyond forgiveness for the thought. Oh bare it then at onceâour brave outbreak, Thusâeven thus outflash it to all eyesâ Joyous to start from its dark scabbard forth, And feel the glow of fight. Must dare and doâ Thoro' goes thro' it. Those same lawyerlings Are ware of us, and they, with their shrewd wits, If tidings lie not, would fain snap us up, And make our treason a foolâAh, but we'll crush Their fingers in their own most cunning trap, And their necks after. Up then friendsâbe bold! Be bold! write that one word, deep on your hearts. For so ye have a talisman, be sure, Safe as the ground ye treadâaye, we know wellâ Who would win this success, must snatch her first, In the grasp of forward fiery confidence; Be sure, she takes for her lord her ravisherâ Whoever dares it. But which way? what means? Ah! 'tis well askedâcudgels, I say stones, flails, Pitchforksâstrong-wielded, they are strength enough: So be our hearts our only fire-shooters, Needs now none otherâ'tis but a rough frayâ When danger comes, we'll meet him, dangerously, Armed to the teeth. But yet, the time is notâ Bludgeons will serve this bout. My trusty friends, What I have said, I think to say again In face of all the people gathered there, Our own, whole-hearted, whole-bound, brotherhood. If then it be your mind, as awhile since You gave your word, now to strike hands with me, The time is on usâelse if to some faint Relishes this same dish seem over-hot, Then make your meal aloofâleave me aloneâ And I will do the work of other men, With Himâfor helper. Stand you there awhile, And make up each his mind: strike or forbear. For I must to the shepherds' a half-hour, And so God speed usâall we have in hand.â BOOK VII. He endedâand his speech from one so mild And maiden-like, amazed them utterly, As who should see a flash of lightning start From a blue sky. Long they stood wondering And witless what to do, much less to say; The sudden danger yawning at their feet So startled them. The first, on his return, Was Linsingen, to frame his mind in speech From that surprise. âHermann, what you have said It is not words but a sheer wonderment. Do I behold thee indeedâart thou thyself? Give me thy handâah, wellâbut why then lock This counsel from thy friend? Beshrew us bothâ Holding so high a stake upon this game Methinks I have full right to know its planâ And have my hand too in the play of it, And Hermann, either you did flatter me, Or this our undertaking, I am its head. The head as I once thought, and others too Upheld me for no lessâbut now it seemsâ This your newâsomethingâhath made nothing of me: And I'm the empty skull, that other brains Supply meâ I've risked all, my means, my life, My pleasures, ah! how genial to enjoy! But I have whistled them away to the winds. And stand myself here on this dizzy edge, Where none but madmen have foothold for their hopeâ And how 'tis doomed in Heaven, Heaven only knows. But, for the worldly rate, all affluence Of Honour, how full swoll'n soe'er, were but A thing of straw against this waste of wealth. E'en tho' 'twere safeâsuch honourânot what 'tisâ Reeling its wild round like a gamester's ballâ With but one hopeful hit 'gainst misses amain, And then all lostâbare as I was erewhile, Better and braver so 'gainst winter and winds, Than my new flush of leaf, which gives no strength Against the storm, but larger hold and sway To its sweeping onsetâHermann! this from thee! If such thy friendship, what were my foes' hate? How should they e'er screw the rack high eno' When their time comes to wreak their will on me. 'Fore Heaven, I fear not danger, all I wish Is to be first and foremost meeting itâ Nor am I such a plodder, if I know Myself, so like an overburden'd ass, That any other man need trip my heels, And, so supplanted, take my room himself, Shouting for hotter speedâa will-o'-wispâ To flash in front of themâonly take heed Lest such a leader land you in a bog, And so fulfil your hopes. WellâI care notâ What I have done I mean others should rue, Not I myself: nor is my heart so poor, So brain-sickly, as sot-like, to puke now, When wassail leaves him muddled on its ebb From his high fit. No, be ye false or true, Shifter or trimmer, I am noneâhold fast What I take upâneither an underling Nor upstart over othersâsave what they Were free to give, and I worthy to take; But of my own merit becomes me notâ Withhold its meed who willââ âNayâ'tis thy right,â With heart o'erflowing Hermann answered him,â âFreely and faithfully I yield it theeâ Take it and holdâ'tis earnestly thy own. But oh no wordâe'en whisper'dâof mistrustâ Thou know'st how little a damp may check the trainâ Must so miss fireâand a two-headed plot Is but a monster of no lasting life, How stoutly limbed soe'er. Then think no thought But that we hold thee our acknowledged head To lead us all, and we to follow thee. What late I said, trust me, that utterance Was but a fainter echo of thy own, Thy spiritâtho' by me outspoken amiss. Then no more wordsârather the proof of them. That proof, so let it come, welcome whene'er, We will fulfil it. Only command thou Boldlyâand we will back thee all as bold, That the head shall have no cause to say to the hand âThou coward.â Whate'er thy call, we answer itâ Forward or back? which shall we? speak the word.â âForward in name of God,â cried Linsingen, Fired as with sudden lightning. âWhate'er be, We will abide it. Seeâon the slope thereâ By Heaven, a goodly muster: if they be As strong in daring as they seem in show, No more were needââ They reached that sundering Ridge, and there stopping, waved their hats on high For friendly token: Those awaiting them Beheld and knew and gladly answered it; Greeting them with so hearty loud a shout That the lone lapwing wheeling o'er their heads Started aside, as from the fowler's shot, At that so sudden alarm: soon were they met With hasty earnestness and grasp of hand: Not such as holiday meetings are wont, Mirthful and light; but as when man with man Is leagued to do some danger, and hands clasp Consciously, in fast-bound conspiracy; Suppress'd, yet strong. Sudden a murmur ran, A birth without a father, thro' the crowd, Stirring its surface up into a swell, Bodal of storm: and as that crowd was swayed This way and that by fitful eagerness, So by the shadow of their coming cloud With wild unwonted feelings hearts were stirred Swelling to meet it. Linsingen awhile Left their deep smouldering warmth to work in them Each upon each; till the glow spread throughout, Threatening to burst in flame. Then he strode forth, And mounted on a hillock there hard by; Heaped up of yore for warriors' burial. âHaply my forefathersâand haply Iâ If those who grind us nowâVengeance thou'rt slow To come, but thy beginning brings their endâ Here Kings are buried, and here Freedom is born, In this birth-hour. Hail to her! So 'twere well; Happen what may to me.â He stood on the mound, And suddenly that tumult became stillâ An awful stillness, ere the hurricane Utter its wrath. âFriends, neighbours, countrymen, Ye were a happy people 'mong these hills 'Neath my sires' sway: and so would be again, If Nature were herself, unmarred by Man: And ye might welcome her free from the scourge Of these raw rulersâAh! it grieves me soreâ So sore; that for this bitter wide-spread grief I relish not God's special gifts to me. TrueâI am wealthyâand youâthe yoke-bearers Are but poor men: Yet are we all alike One kindâstill closer, for that faithful tie Between our forefathers. Ah! happy days! When Right and Nature ruledâShe gave to them Her wealth, who gave to her their livelong toil, (So once our clan laboured these common lands) And the idle hand she left it empty too. And so should we; but for their selfishnessâ Their kind and gentle selvesâthe Aristocratsâ The ratsâa true name, taken by the tailâ So call themâfor why lengthen in the mouth The bitter tangâBut we might bear e'en thisâ If this alone: but bad begets still worse: And I'yranny, where once it makes a sore, Must fret and gnaw it to an angry foul Ulcerâwith cankering claws. We were content To till God's free gift Earth for our hard bread; And pay for leave to do it: Yes, Industry Pay Idleness the grain and best of the chaff For leave to be itself. This had we borneâ But then comes one demanding what our toil Hath earned to buy its bread and eat in peace, For wars to wage therewithâin Christian loveâ And so Christ crucified againâhewnâshotâ Drown'd in a gore of bloodâby us, his sons, Against ourselves and himâCan this be well? Oh noâand what is next betters it not, But makes the wormwood venom. Ye all know How, striving in scant hope, our sturdy toil Hath yet improved that hope to harvestage, And waste to wealthâhath tamed yon rugged hills, Made conquest of their stubborn barrenness, And set its golden sheaves for trophies up Over the field. Methinks, who did so much, Deserves a better quittance for the deed Than beggary and gaol. But toiling worth Is but a silly assâmust do drudge-work, And thenâeat thistles. Well, our fields are full. Down comes the parsonâlike a crow at scent Of carrion, and claims the law of us: He who ne'er lent a hand at time of need, To put it in then first at harvest-tide, Taking his tenthâso leaving us our loss, To live on it. A man strange to us all, A lone black raven, croaking hatefully, Whose doctrine was ne'er heard or known to us, Or known but for the off-curse of our souls. What followed on that claim is deep in your hearts, I will not brand it deeper by my words. Let woe go weep in silence. My dear friends, Are ye already full to the overflow, Or needs there one drop more? Said I a drop? Oh! 'tis indeed a flood doth threaten us With rage most ruthless. Ayeâyon hillsâyon streamsâ Ours and our forefathers, our inborn right, Which to tear from us 'twere as well tear out Our eyes from out our headsâthese must they haveâ And we must shrink within our dull clay-walls: For if we peer beyond them, well I ween 'Tis outright treason. Such a thing as this Burdens us worse than man can bearâthe backâ And harder yet, the heart: gores our whole life. Whoso but thinks of it, his thought straightway Must lash itself to madness. But what boots To think, or talk, or mutter, or aught else But rise and strike forthwith. 'Tis all is left: The one good hope that sets us wretches above The toad in harrowâaye, and with this one We may requite our loss, with gain thereto; Else be forlorn of all. My friends, this tale I've told it truly, as an earnest man; Truth without aggravation. For what needs To flare up Hell with fireworks, or fire-words? Besidesâmy heartâits outswell chokes my speech: What more I shouldâforgive meâbetter I were At sword-stroke, my sires wont. Hermann, stand forth And speak our wrongs as thou well knowest them; And if thou can'st devise some milder means To quench this fever without flow of blood, I'll hold thee for a healer above price, And bless thy skill: else we must draw the sword, E'en as our foes compel us, and God wills.â That speech was Truth, but, utter'd brokenly, It died in air, seeking an answering shout, But finding none in that full meeting of friends: Faltering halfway; e'en as a miner's train Broken, before the lurking magazine Hath caught its flash, and with a burst of wild Uproar, outblown all round. Yet, what he spoke, Twas not unknown, nor unapproved to them: They willed none other: but the many are like Tinder, soon firing, if the flint strike swift And strongly on the steel, and the sparks fall Streaminglyâelse dull, cold, and dark: for light And heat they have but scantly in themselves; Must from without. The forward faculty Of words, to wield them, cannily, at will, Never did Linsingen give heed to it And lacked it nowâwith his cramped utterance Baulking their zealâas a flagging sail bemocked By gusts untoward. Oh words! air-words! how much Stronger than substance are ye over will! Who would be great must con and ken ye well To help his greatness. Linsingen stood back; And Hermann, thus, calmly at first, began: âMy friends! my brethren of this Fatherland, I thank ye, that ye're met thus earnestly; And these same thanks your children shall repeat To bless your memories; and what erewhile I wondered, that your patience was so tame, That wonder is rebuked, and your wise truth Self proven from its fruit; else were this birthâ This outbreak, now so hopeful, since ripetimed, Abortive from rash hurry. What ye've heard Of evils by our leader here rehearsed, Doubtless you've felt them also deep within, Worse than the bitterest words. The man that writhes Beneath a whip, needs none to whisper him âThis smart is true, thou dreamest not.â But yeâ Have ye so felt, that feeling hath become A flame, and with its sufferance fed its strength For self-redress? For me, my calling is God'sâ A Gospeller, a shepherd of men's souls: And I have striven that my working life Should earn itself that nameânot that the name Should throw its cloak of falsehood o'er my life. And in this truth, as I have walked in it, So, have I taught ye evermore the like, To practise faithfully and earnestly What ye profess. Such faith should give its own Proof, in forbearance of wrongs done to it. So, I beseech ye, undergo in Christ Each his own burden, wreaking not himself: But for his neighbour and the commonweal; Impatience of their wrongs is all as true Righteousness as to bear meekly our own. Aye, and I tell ye, the one lives and grows Out of the other's death. All we forego Of indignation, each on self-behalf, We hoard it for our brethren and country's need To crush her outragers. That warrants us Thus rising to redress her rightfully. For 'tis not restiveness 'gainst public wrong, But passiveness beneath it that keeps backâ Nayâbut stamps downâMan's welfare. When without Cause, did e'er folk revolt? 'Tis not the curb, But the spur, they need. Selfishness fears to stirâ Will rather sufferâ(so short-sighted is wealth, So coward, so mean)âthan help uphold the main Fence with its several stake. Thus doth each man's Default lay open the whole All-man's field To one man's rule. Look roundâhow many huge Nations, whose hugeness might be great, if free, Are sunk in slavery? Age after age, Father to son. 'Tis fear and faint distrust Of his fellow, so dooms man to cowardly Forbearanceâ'neath the Tyrant's wilful yokeâ Wrongful howe'er: those tyrantsâthat distrust Upholds themâand they too uphold it in turn Most foullyâwhat care they for sighs and groans? 'Tis shot and steel and trusty fellowship Of Patriots must stir themâbut that sharp Avenging Angel, few and far between Are his onslaughtsâGodly and glorious whene'er. Hallowed each Marytyr who in righteousness Answering that angel-call by high behest Uprises to resist and sternly smite The evil Ruler, worst of wrong-doersâ Fighting 'gainst him, for Godâ This had ye done Many years since, then had much sin been spared To your Rulers, and much sufferance to you: And yet 'tis wellâsince that sour leaven hath raised Your souls to Freedom; and your meekness spurned Warrants ye by sheer force to win, what Truth With lowly prayer protesting, is but paid With mockery: from robbers to preach back Their prey! How humble! how hopeful! Noâour Lords Make famine law; and we must quit them home, Making Rebellion dutyâlook to the wise Statesmen of the Westâone penny, wrongfully Taxed on their tea, to them was a just warâ They fought and won itâglorious thenceforthâ And weâour breadâour lifeâthus clipped! dear friends, I do beseech ye for the good of all Abate the wrongful few; drown Flunkeydom In the gutterâplush and allâlace, puff bag, plumes, Put Manhood in its placeâWreak your short wrathâ That lasting peace may 'stablish on sure grounds, Our rights, our lives, our fortunes of us all. For meâye've known me long, and what ye know Be it my witness; if tried hitherto, True in all else, staidâearnestâfree of selfâ Then trust me this: and oh! misdeem me not To think I and my office are at odds For that, since this sore mischief gnaws our life, I counsel yeâbut what 'vails counsel? whom sheer Stress of misrule doth drive us to such deedsâ As else I would not, for all worlds to win. But now both Need and Conscience cry us on And Faithâfor know ye brethren what Faith is? No sluggard thing, but like the air we breathe, Which feeds our life with its calm influence, But yet can storm foul things away; and stir This world's pool, with its healing angel-wings. Yes, it comes down to win us peace on earth Thro' its own warfareâfor what Christ himself Said, that He cast a firebrand light 'mong men, That must we do: preparing the Lord's way, Straightening the crooked paths, smoothing the rough, Filling each valley, levelling each hill. So shall all flesh see God's salvation wrought, And Faith fulfilled. This for my function's sake: Lest ye should deem I wrong its holiness, To bless thus boldly and hallow your outbreak. Next, since with force outright meet them we mustâ Our force, what is it, in amount and plight, How willed, how weapon'd, how enured to war? Why brethren, neither witch nor wizard am I, Nor have no spell to make our weakness strength, Nor their strength weaknessâonlyâwe are menâ And in our manhood must we strongly win, Or sternly die. Ah! but if that be our aim, There have been others have essayed the like: And how they sped, their history is writ In their own bloodâthe headsman's axe fulfilled Its sharp behest more surely than their sword. True, they fared illâmost true, they died half-way, Whom this low world, that they should live in it, Was all unworthy. Martyr, hangman and judge Are dead alike; the loss of life, the odds Of a few years, Time hath made even now. But there's an after doom all must abide: And there are three men and three several hopes, And which think you the best and fairest one? Oh! I've strong faith their earthly doom stands not In HeavenâSure for the good fight they fought, Wrestling 'gainst principalities and powers, The rulers of the darkness of this world, There is laid up for them a righteous crown By the Lord's graceâSo for the heavenly hope: Now for the earthly one. They failed and why? 'Twas their will first, and then their shaft, fell short. For what is he but a fool, the man who fain Would shoot thro' a steel plate, and strings his bow With a silk thread, and draws it silken-like, Most girlish? but on their ruins we climb, O'er the dead body of their enterprise; The mouldering bone-heapsâtheir sad witnesses Of downfal, our shrewd warning for success. But how succeed, what hope, what means, which way? Why, brethren, 'tis but first to know yourselvesâ How strongâso knowing, and so manfully With your known strength working your righteous will. For ye are the main body, sinew, bone, Blood of this land: and what ye will, ye shall, Spite of your lords: whose strongest power is but An idle plume, that waves on the steel cap, And idly waving fondly brags itself To guard the head and crown it over-flaunts: A show for courtly sunshine, joy and pride, To swell the flunkey soul, but in the crash Of fight, 'mid flashing swords and cloven helms, Where is their vaunt?âgone!âfor the feather it is, Fluttering down the wind. Friends, what ye will That shall ye have, so ye will earnestly. But such an earnest will needs earnest worth For motive. There they erred, who fondly dreamt Their brain-born constitution had some charm That full contentment needs must follow it. A thing without heart, life, or likelihood, With ink for all its bloodâa birth still bornâ In the printers' winding sheets. That idol fellâ Fell, flat as Dagon. The folk's eager will 'Gan wane, and then, wrathful to feel itself So fooled, broke out, self-maddened; till in that Mad fit, it stormed all strength away, then sankâ Sank down, weakly and listlessly, to wear The old fetters. But for us, a better wit Guides us a better way; and, be ye sure The spirit that we raise we'll feed it tooâ Fail it shall not for food. Rash say yeâhow so? Come forth the man who said it. Yes, erewhile I was discreet in counsel and in deed; But well I know boldest decision now Is best discretion. What, again? brute force, Say'st thou, brute force? why yes, my feeble friend, 'Tis truly to be dreaded: but by whom? By those whose wrongful weakness withholds aught From rightful strength: look to our sires! long years They wasted arguing, then armed and won. E'en so must we likewise; since peace is a plague, Gird we our loins for war. Ye, who've no sword Sell each his coat and buy one; for know this: The devil of selfish sway will rend us sore Ere he quit hold of usâscabbard awayâ He hath no ears for parleyâand best soâ For in old abuse compromise is no cure, Better off-sweep it with high-handed sway. Self-willed: which asks no warrant from times past, And those that shall come after, gives them none; Since sprung from the sword's point, not the Law's pen. Needing no curious adjustment nice, No purblind charters; nor fears shallows or straits, Since steering the main seaâso were all safe: So should our revolution go full round, Smooth as the earth revolving in mid-air, No partial cheek nor jarâselfish concerns Confounded in main change: no struggle or spite, Quibbling, that frets against small tampering shifts, But wonder and dumb aweâe'en prejudice Once launched, losing all hold of olden things Must needs along, must cling to Freedom's ark, Foregoing its fond trappings, or else drown In Freedom's floodânor bicker against doom, But undergo the yoke. True the folk's will Is slow to kindle, heavy to upraise, But set our lever once on the land's self, We'll heave it high enough. Then if your will Hold fellowship with mine, resolve we thus. Since wrongfulness hath overridden of old Our hard-earned rights, our welfare, freedom, and faith, Well nigh to the extinction of all three; The poor man by the rich outlawed of bread, The Law depraved, the Church careless of Christ. And since this folk, forbearing hitherto, But stirred at last for Truth's sake and their own, Hath sought redress of grievance and found none. But rather hath been mocked of scornful men, Called, but untrue, the representatives And working body of the people's will: Who yet in truth do none the smallest thing Whereof that people would. Therefore 'tis thus Agreed, and thus resolved by those met here. 'Tis good and fitting that the commonalty In might and right of its own majesty, Seeing that selfish lords unanswerable To its Law, have hitherto trampled it down, Should undertake itself its own self-rule, And frame its tide, its life-blood, in its true Channel, to run straightforward from its source: From its side-issues feeding its side-fields. Begin we then from God's own Truth, hat man's True life is mainly self development, Which cannot be without self-government. And as the man's life, so the folks' likewise Must be self-framed thro' its own mind's forewill, Else were that life some other's, not its own. Hence must the folk's will settle the folk's law Not for the gain of few, but the main good, Likeliest reached by self-rule; since no folk Willingly wrongs itself; or at worst, when known, Will sure redress the wrong. Thence, how folk-rule Were best fulfilled, 'tis our main need to know. Therefore divide this land into new shires, Thirty or more, with each a million souls, And forty representatives for each, Whereof the greatest rentowners shall name Eight, and the greatest taxpayers eight more. Each class, on stated qualifying votes And rents, the higher having plural rates; The highest, ten, those intermediate As council shall deem best; the lowest twoâ All below these three several standards, one. Next the learned callings, those allowed, shall name Four steadmen; and the other rate and tax Payers shall last name twenty; since the highest Stands not without the lowest; and the higher A State is reared, it needs a broader base. Besides, no safeguard else the workman hath Upholding all, but oft down-trodden himself. But those unrated, who earn wages, or else Have means, shall pay a poll-tax, and be called Pollmen, and any three of them may choose To vote for them, by secondary voice, One steadman, who shall give one vote for the three. So none shall be denied free choice, but those Who live by idle alms or theft, nor pay E'en the poll-taxâsuch have no part with us. For bulwark some must be 'gainst rabble rule: Since only the warm working blood can build The body; which rejects or excreates all Dull or dead offal as unfit for its frame. Hence only those should choose State-rulers who bear State-burdensâso shall worth have steadying weight. Such forty steadmen, making the shiremote, Shiremotes-men shall be called, and rule the shire: Which so, shall be self-governed in its own Concerns, a lesser State within the main. Choosing its headmote for executive, Committee-men for reference and report, And Senate for revisal, fifteen men, Who shall vote first in the main body, and then Revise its sanctions. This shiremote shall have Large powers, but local only, and e'en these Subject to regulation by the main Landmote; but such control to countervail These lower motes shall choose that highest one. Thusâeach of the twelve hundred from the shires Shall name, for the main, one hundred, women or men. At large, no local limit: for so worth Shall likeliest get its due reward, and so May lofty minds, tho' few and far apart, Combine their rays to one true central choice, And thro' such concentration reach their ends Hopeless from trivial suffrage. And of those So named, the hundred on whom most votes meet Shall serveâthus mainlyâbut some specialties Omitted here, must riper counsel adjustâ Then, as the shiremotes, the mainmote likewise, Its process shall ordain and settle its state, Thro' headmote, senate, and committee-man: Thence, single and supreme shall rule the whole land, From this its constitution: which shall ne'er Be changed, unless by two-thirds of its own Motesmen, and also, of the joint shiremotesâ From such safeguards Democracy hath hope, And so, its fearful name forgotten, and fierce Nature foregone in righteous mild folk-rule, It sets more truly forth the fable old: To belly and limbs adding head and heartâ Its heart the folk's willâthe lawmote its headâ Its belly the main toil-won wealthâits limbs The workmen. Thus the whole, fitly compact, May grow up one true body, one live Church, Atoned in Christ to God. A body now Hugely uncouth and brutish; but henceforth Within its stalwart fabric, sound and safe, Confining and compressing its own forceâ May guide from its head-counsel its heart-blood; Tho' swirling oft, never o'erswelling in wild Excess: and haply so shall speed its hopeâ But thereto needs stedfast conservative Channels, a strong-boned life-stead to frame blind Hot-blood: for loose power works no good, but waste Only, until in due limits coercedâ Thus be the State-rule settled: and, henceforth The rule of property should be redress'd From its wrong bias unto its right aimâ Which is, indeed, to comfort industry As sure it doth, where Reason limits itâ Tho' oftener, self-seeking greediness Hath wrested it, to pamper idleness: Resolve we then this foremostâthe land's growth By God's grace given, belongs only to those Thro' whom, by work or wages, skill or means 'Tis grown; hence on each farm be the farmer's stock Rated, and for its use a yearly hire Be paid him on that rate from the land's growth, And for his management a further share; Also some quittance to the owner of late, And for State-tax; the rest, they who have toil'd Shall share, by rule of overseers ordained To allot hands to work, and judge debates; But for the landlord 'tis an impious name, By man usurped from Godâname and right too We forsay wholly and bury them for dead. Henceforth the State shall hold their ownership, Paying them compensation, lest they starve: The less as they have taxed the more our bread For many years, and now must quit the account. But since high-birth with breeding, hath some soul Of goodness, specially its own, tho' oft Self-shamedâand courtesy, which, more than speech, Lifts man above brutes, should belong to it, Thence in that hope, Gentry we will uphold For sake of the whole folk more than its own; Nor will we only uphold, but strengthen it, On its landstead, deep-rooted from old time. Erst as landowner, hence as landholderâ For such landlordship courteous and high-born Is Aristocracy; when true, a truth Lovely, not hateful; tho' some hate its name: But lest it sink to Alazonocracy In dronish proud self-will, we must find means How its good leaven may work thro' the loafâ Therefore each shire in hundreds shall be split, And these in tithingsâand each tithing choose From its indwellers, motes-men for its own Friendsmote, and for the main friendsmote of the whole Hundred, one steadman. These friendmotes shall be For social ministration, as lawmotes For legalâor as crime and causemotes, each For its calling. Shall State ordinance, choose heads, And divide functions: taking cognizance Of what belongs to them; friendly concerns Improvement, pastime, furtherance of whate'er Helps welfare; soul or body; science, art, Skill, culture; comfort, social and spiritual: 'Bove all, of their poor brethren's needâtheir main Mighty undertaking, unwieldy to all else But Christian Love, which hence shall supersede The hateful iron Poor Law, enforced no more. And of these friendmotes, bye and main, the chief Landholders in the country, and in towns, The foremost townsmen shall be senators: And with them others, whom professional Skill, trade and wealth shall name, each from its bulk. That choice may overrule ill chance: and thence Those that were hitherto but forestanders Shall be foredoersâeach to undertake What best becomes him and belongs to him After his callingâso a circle wide Of Christian work were open to each willâ But that were littleâcommon erst as air, And no more prizedâbut nowâ'twere much to feel The spur of special duty, and the glow Of fellowship: to swell the cheerful shout Of progress, lend an earnest helping hand 'Gainst Satan's tottering throne, and do the work Of a new manly, Christian, godly worldâ Not of the old self-hacknied worldiness. To be God's fellow-workersâThat were muchâ These friendmotes mean and hope it. So our new Landholders shall become a living power From a dead ownership. Leading aloft, Not like a kite's tail, all unwillingly Draggling and wriggling after. So shall speed What now they clogâeach in his several range Mainly, but helping others, where he can, For social, moral, and material good. O'erseeing the poor, schools and hospitals; Furnishing in fair halls at public cost For mote-days their friend meetings, for folk-days Teachings and recreations; helps for art, Skill, science; music, lectures, manly games In parks and gardens; welcoming the folk With kindly hospitable holidays. So best may Aristocracy assert Itself, and, haply, blend thro' handicraft And drudging toil some gentler feeling and grace, And love of fair refining fellowship. With hope to make these slow grades stepping-stones To the all-atoning altar crowning them. So may such shire-motes, friendmotes, magistrates With weighty ballast steady the State-ship. Else, danger, lest the folk, drops multiplied To an ocean, each self-weak, but mighty in main, Should if self left, by Conscience uncontrolled Within, be drawn by influence from without Thro' thoughtless fellowship, or mooning wild Agitation and attraction, to break loose In reckless wild excess, unknowing whyâ Or if known, wrongfulâfrom hate, envy or greed. Therefore we need standards of weight and worth O'er the low level upreared loftily, For popular respect to look to them In Love, Faith, Reverence; and so lift itself Above itself to the height it contemplates. And that such standards be not lightly stirred, Like pyramids, self-sure in their own strength Majestic, tempering glare with shadowy awe, And staying what they o'ersee, the shifting sands, Which else from blind instinctive surging drift Make all one desert, barren as themselves. These standards, in each shire, as magistrates Shall advise, arbitrate, conciliate, In all Life's knotty needs, not Law alone; Guiding in simpler cases untaught minds Thro' legal forms and process; then what kind Counsel avails not, shall decide by Law. Beside all this, for the land's management The landholders shall be land-ministers; For God and the main good: for their own too: Accounting each to the State; whose steadman he is. And for that purpose they shall hold in each Tithing their farmmotes, weekly, as may seem, Or monthly, rendering their reports therein To the head-mote and councilâo'erlooking work, Employing, paying workmen, buying too And selling 'neath the farm-council's controlâ Which, if skill, health or honest earnest will Fail him, shall name some fitter in his stead. And of his pay as working landholder Abate one half: its full amount being fixed On thoro' inquisition by the State. Which, shall hereafter be sole landowner. Leaving each landholder his own homestead With its park, garden, all appendages, On a light yearly quittance. Paying all rent, And taking, in corn-worth; reserving too These and all other questions for its own Revisal, and full final settlement. Taking good heed that landholders shall rue Little, if at all, their loss of ownership. But as their management, must their meed be, This scanted if that slacken'd. To these ends Be the land's native worth valued, and on That value be assessed a fixed State-rent, To be new settled once in twenty years. Thereafter labourer, farmer, landholder (Who may himself be farmer, finding stock), Shall each be paid from sale of the year's growth, On scale of graduation 'tween two terms, Highest and lowestâthe most gainful years Shall so supply the scantiestâand leave, too, Beside that surplus some for other needsâ Thus all shall gain from improved managementâ And things most needful shall be dealt from stores, That weekly wage may be less needed; and these, Managers, one from each class, shall control. For cheapness both and goodnessâand withal To keep off filching meddlers from the fund. We need not so much counter-sleightâagainst All comers. This same council, in three sets Shall class, and pay its workmen by their worth On larger farms: for the smaller, what one man Can till, that let him holdâpaying State-rent Onlyâdouble for grass, single for ploughâ Thus mainlyâbut full rules of management From riper thought, shall our chief council ordain. Next for the Law: 'tis much in faultâbehoves To bring it back to Truth, whence 'tis bewrayed. Untwisting all the wiles of crookedness To open-handed clear straightforwardness: But so to settle rules of right and wrong, Strong minds, not lawyers' craft is neededâas well Ask foxes to guard geese. 'Tis a stiff taskâ Who undertakes it, must well heed these truths. Law must be stern and strict; since Law and Love Were ever, and are, twain: and for Man's weal The characters of evil against good, Black against white, by slackness now o'erslurred, By justice must be deeply branded in: That wickedness may rue, goodness rejoice. But since the Law hath lost much of its dread Thro' silly sentimental maunderers, Who cherish evildoers, it shall now Be sharpened, to smite sorely, as of yore. That Sin may see and shudderâHence, slow pains Shall precede Death, more fearful than itself, Foreshadowing to the sinner his own Hell. For who but fools deem all murder alike? Some from hot bloodâsome prove the murderer Self-sold to Satan, should thence bear his brand. For the evildoer, hard work, hard fare; short scourge Nor other comfort than the hope to escape Here and hereafter, by behaviour fair Proven thro' lingering trial, the sour lot He abhors, nor likely its return will risk. Sorrow and steady toil starve guilt: The known Prison scares sinners more than the unknown Hell. Next, longer doom must punish each relapse, That lengthened toil may beget skill, and each Prison from its inmates work sustain itselfâ Further, to shorten suits and strife, all debt By sale, shall be of faith, not lawâwho will May trustâelse take a pledge: sue he shall not. So each man to himself were law enough And safeguardâbut who wilfully runs risk, Let him rue itânor crave help from Law, meant only A shield 'gainst others, not against self-wrong. Then honesty, again, as erst, were high Honour, and life's path cleared of thousand thorns. Next, lawyers shall be all law-officers, Under the sword, as clients under the shield Of State; which shall receive all fees from these After its settled standard, and pay those A yearly salary; also a fixed Per-centage on fees earned for it by them. One such law-officer shall the State name For every district, who shall keep the maps Of all its parishes, with properties All numbered in a triplicate register For him, the parish church, and State, one each, Lest the State be defrauded of its dues. Nor any advocate shall be allowed Unless for party's disability. Or for transcendent import of the cause: But law-clerks of the State, one for each side, Shall frame all pleadings into written form. But this foreprocess, in civil suit; shall be. The magistrate, whoe'er belongs, shall hear The parties, and if need be, witnesses, To hinder, by atonement, hateful strife, And if thence reconcilement grow, so good, Else, the gainsayer, if cast, shall pay a fine. And if such magistrate shall deem the plaint Doubtful, the plaintiff shall give bail for costs, Then be the suit to another magistrate Carried; to one for small; to three or four Jointly, for greater stakes; to the full court For revisal, on appeal. Such courts shall search, Settle and instate the resulting right, Whether of law, or fact, or both, without A jury's blundering blockheadedness. Thus for all civil suits, and if the change Work well, for criminal tooâonly in State Trials, for treason, libel, or sedition, And also libel and slander between men, The jury shall decide: and, five of six Shall condemn, else the culprit shall go clear. For Freedom's life is free discussion in speech Or writ: and State-power needs much counterpoise. For selfish men, the many, of folk-right Reck not: would let the shepherd wrong the sheep. Thence whoso 'gainst State-wrong sounds the alarm, Deserves much honour for his zeal, slight blame For hasteâforbear him then, or give him at least A jury of his countrymen for judge; Husband and wife shall answer each for self, Not the other; and hold severally each their own. No suit shall be for marriage unfulfilled, Save on betrothal registered in form; Nor for seduction any civil suit, But criminal. No man for his agents' acts Shall answer, (under stress of law) unless Specially ordered, or needfully implied. Traders shall not be sworn to try trade debts. Game, where'er found, shall be the landowners, And poachers doomed as thieves. Laws shall be fram'd 'Gainst drunkenness and those who foster it. A tenant holding over after due Notice to quit, shall be deemed a trespasser, And for the owner, any constable Entry may force, and reinstate his right. Better so shortly at first, than troublously At last, as now. Judges shall mend mistakes, Unless misleading the main cause. No quirks Technic shall thwart Truth, nor entitle fraud. No minor's debt shall ever bind him, unless For plain clothes, food, and shelter, lest he starve. Nor lords be bound for more than working men. Nor shall e'en marriage give a right to more. And since what once was sport is poison now, Running, like wildfire, yearly worse and worse, Thro' our country's blood; no horse shall run in race Under four years, two miles, and ten stone weight; To try swift strength, not sleight of jadish speed, Else, be horse forfeitâowner and rider fined. None shall take other than his father's true Birth-name, but on State leave, and a thousand pounds Paid downâthe same for every month, if un- Licensed; to strip the swindler's self-plumed show. These and what other changes may seem good To shorten, cheapen process, amend, improve, Fit council shall revise, settle, decree. Thus shall Law wield, not only scourge and sword, But an olive-branch withal; may heal the sore She now but wrathens. Not as hirelings do, Warping, belying, juggling right and wrong, Clashing with cunning drift, each against each, Two self-wills, blindly to be crushed or bruised, But standing fair between, to balance both. So tempering doom with grace: not without hope To renew Christian brotherhood, from strife Not wholly unfair, hateful, or ruinous. Further, the State shall help, or even compel (If need be, failing other helpful means) Co-operation between hirer and hired; By partnership of profits: binding so Master and man to the only union true, Of mutual gain or loss, trust and goodwill. Abating here self-pride; there envious spite. And since short weights and measures are to God Abomination, and a crying curse To Man, from buyers wronged, sellers depraved; Henceforth, for all such dealers be dealt back The felon's doom, foreiture, gaol, hard work, So should worst thieves worst rue their thievery. For those too who sell silver and gold, debased Below mint-standard, or adulterate food. And be it resolvedâthe Church is naughtâa thing Rotten throughout, essence and ordinance: No true Church, for the Lord dwells not therein, But a foul den, sheltering many thieves, And money-changers, trafficking men's souls With hire and sale, instead of saving Grace. Being one half or nigh to their own flocks Foreigners, knowing them no otherwise Than feeding on their flesh, clothed with their fleece. Truly, a sin to draw damnation down Not only on them but us who suffer them; As God will sure require it at our soulsâ Therefore let this huge scandal be pulled down, And then reframed in frame apostolic After old Wickliffe, his right earnest wise. That so the clergy first be Christianized. Thence shall each congregation rule itself Without all bias of authority In things of Faith save the free Bible alone. Choosing its elders, and they choosing again Deacons and preachers of the Word; whereof Each preacher; so he profess faith in Christ's Teachings, shall be his own interpreter. No other forms of creed imposed on him. And tithes shall cease, and each Church bear its charge They who own none being taxed in aid of allâ Not without profit to themselvesâfor God's Worship much hinders Satan's wasteful lures. But since by holy writ we have one Priest Only, and one Faith-founder, Christ alone, And since the only words spoken by Christ For rule of worship forbid public prayer And ordain privateâstand we brethren fast, Whatever others may ordain, by Christ's Standardâbound man with man in covenant Thereto: nor take from preacher nor from book Our prayers: such strange dry stuff, like painted sticks, Kindle not, warm, nor stay the soul within; Which from live inward growth alone can bear Faith's fruit, and knowing its own needs, in its own Ground rooted, by its own Conscience convinced, Shall find its one sure comfort in self-prayer. This to unfold, not others nor his own The preacher should intend, leaving between His sermons, readings, hymns, some awful space Of silence: for soul-prayer, each 'gainst his heart's Evil, and for its good 'neath stated heads, Some time allowed for each, but thereto needs For minds unskilled to inward homily Earnest foretrial and self-tasking Truth. These should the preacher quicken, and each Church Thro' Faith's sore troubles, by communion and class Help its own children. So may worship and work Be blent together in true Christian life. And be it resolved that everwearing toil Befits not man, being brute drudgery; Unless, which few men can, he raise his work To worship, doing all he doth for God. Else must such hardship stunt his nature, born Earthly, but yet for self-development To Heaven, a little lower than angels are. And from this rule the working-man hath right Of leisure and appliance to enlarge His span of life; toiling to live, and not Living to toil, as need o'erstrains him now: Barring all spiritual exercise, Stunting all holy growth, and robbing so His soul of its unprized, tho' God-given Birthright, its means of grace, and hope of Heaven. Then to forfend this evil, and gain this good, Let fitting recreation be foreseen, Both for refreshment of Man's weekly toil, And holy comfort after worldiness. But, since vice ever grows from vacancy, Therefore let needful aids be minister'd To occupy in sport or seriousness The space that else the evil one would fill. And be those aids varied for various needs. Gardens and spacious shades, where the weary sense In their cool freedom may refresh itself; And contemplative leisure study God By Nature's help, his best interpreter; Besides, what ground for pastime may seem meet Whenever thronging toil hath holiday, For lusty games, and proof of manliness. Next, since Man sins only from lack of true Knowledge, mistaking evil for his good; And as he learns, e'en so he practises, Practising only what he first hath learned; Therefore it much behoves the common good And common right that each man be taught well: Lest evil discipline lead to ill deeds; And then the Law rising up wrathfully Albeit itself worthier far of blame In its default, than was the man in his act, Do bloody vengeance on the deed foredone: Making much evil in its slothfulness, And mending it with more in its hastiness; To punish eager, as careless to prevent: Rather a hangman than good governor: For to him kindly grace and love belongsâ Therefore be there provided public schools, Industrial for good behaviour, toil, Love, godliness: to strengthen body and heart First, and then soul and mind to earnestness. Thither shall those within that school-range send Their children, or else prove their time well-spent For earningsâsince work teaches better 'n books: There shall each girl be taught things useful and good, Deftly to sew, then read, write, cypherâand what Of household work schools can; but far 'bove these Conditions gentle and gracious, kindness, truth, Reverence for elders, willingness to work, Holiness; but the boy, if born to toil Yet like to learn, as one in twenty may, Let him be taught: up to accounts: for trade And skilled handcraft: thence, if his bent of will Drive him toward learned callings, give him aid For his whole mind fully to unfold itself. Else, if dull, froward or untowardly For books, (as worthiest workers often are, Since stolid implies solid, muscle and bone, In them more prominent than nerve and brain) Then teach him to love God, and those who in life Belong to him; to do biddings; work well. No moreâfor Manhood needs no wider ringâ Such lowly wisdom shames the sharpest wit. And what he lacks of learning, if his wife Own it, he loves her, his helpmate, all the more; Each from the other getting what each needs Kindly commutual; his strength with her skill: Thence to the weaker wife shall respect grow In wedlock: Hence the mother to her own Standard will strive to bring her children up. So childhood shall be taughtâbut when, toward noon, Youth ripens into manhood, let free-will Be kindly aided to take up the aim By discipline foregone at her due time. And to that end the friendmotes may help much. Somewhat perhaps by booksâbut more by talk, Cheerful, and teachings of the living tongue, With pictured illustration; and not least Concerts, for friendly order and accord, Games, singing, dancing; for such lively hints Tune not alone the body, but the mind, In moving harmony. So Grace, too, grows; And finer sentiment so to the soul Attempered, may teach fitness to the uncouth, And subdue sinful lust to heart-blending Love. Or, first in comelier spirits, somewhat o'er self Prevailing, may from them reach and redeem The low coarse clay from utter loutishness. But since all gifts and grace beside, without Godliness, leave man where they found him, low As the dust whence he was drawn, so culture's first And latest aim must be that godly oneâ For Nature needs thoro' development Mostly in man, her highest and best work, When fulfilledâelse if stunted, lowest and worst. Being then a mannish bruteâmore mischievous Since strengthened with man's organs for brute lust. And such development cannot stop short At self, but spreads thro' social and politic, And rises by devotion unto God. Therefore behoves us practically in man To prosecute God's project, and unfold The hard-coiled heart to expansive sympathy Outward; with Faith upward and holiness: From its central spot to a wide circumference Of kind concern, from sense to godly soul, Public from private, patriot from self-love. So Freedom may run happily between Law and Religion, steadfast continents. And so Man's earthly spirit may sum itself In heavenly: from such beginnings small, Thro' fellow-feeling trained, by daily wont Of duties, social, politic, devout, To God at lastâwoe to who hinders it, But how best help, needs counsel wiser 'n mine. Next, council should advise, how best to make Wedlock, life's stem, where its roots meet, and whence Its branches, leaves, fruit, grow, a well-earned high Reward of steady worth: a holy tie, Not a chance huddled knot, tangled too oft, And brangled; also how train boy and youth To wholesome awe and deference worshipful For elders, teachers, masters; seldom now Proven, but blackguardly self-will instead With outlash wild shaming our slack outleave. Needs sharp strict curb: else riot will rule all. And be it resolved, soldiership shall not be A special calling, but all men alike Enured in arms, to help defensive need. And be it resolved, 'tis an unholy thing To make a general dearth for gain of few. Therefore what other lands can send, be ours Free to receive, save the State's needful dues. But by this law: the rule that other lands Apply to us, shall we apply to them. First then, we tax a tenth of its worth here On produce of all countries that take ours At a like rate or lessâif they exact More, so will we; by rule reciprocal. Else, if they send us their excess, yet shut Their market against ours, free-trade is none: Nor any reason why we should so help Their efforts to outdo our skill with theirs By giving them all vantage, taking none. Besides, 'tis good by fostering home growths To save the cost of transport, and to shift Some part of our State-load on aliens. Who else with riper clime and working means And lower wage would overbear our own; Making our land a sink for all their cheap Superfluous offal, and thence heading back Our course of home-trade, as full dykes stop drains: Sickening our field-growth and handicraft, Till by that flooding refuse stifled and sunk In swamp-like sour stagnation it droops and dies. Then, from all rivals freed, that foreign cheap Stuff becomes dear, as practise sadly proves. Words then we trust not, but till trade be free Indeed, we deal with others as they with us. And since to what we've holden long we hold Most, from old wontâbut what comes suddenly Is surplus, and what's taken thence, is felt Less sorely, likelier spared; therefore the State To prompt men to live kindly, not die rich, Shall take one third of a dead man's ownership: One half if he die childlessâall he owned Within his last year, being reckoned his: Unless on sale for worthâall who partake Must disclose all; whoe'er hides or abets Shall forfeit his whole share with prison and fine. Further, the old straightforward course of trade Is now sore cursed with meddlersâmiddle-menâ Brokersâor fitlier, breakersâhopeless whoe'er Is stranded 'mong them: whence trade's even tide Is wabbled up and down, trust oftentimes Betrayedâfraud rifeâtraffic demoralized. And by shrewd selfish concert needful goods Forestalled, and prices screwed; that the poor man's mites May swell the griper's millions. True, all this, So the blockbook-heads tell us, is all rightâ We feel it a sore crying wrong; and as such Smite it; thus: all stocks, shares, debentures, bonds, Bills, values, funds of states or companies, Or chartered bodies, shall be sold to buyer By owner, with no middleman between, Or else by public sale, at foreset time And place; daily or weekly, as seems good. And any middle man on brokerage Of other goods and values shall pay two Per cent. of the sale's import, to the State: (Unless such sale be public: 'tis then free.) With penalty of twice the value's amount Half to the State, half to the informer due, By the delinquent broker to be paid. Further, all copyrights, monopolies And patents, are alike unwarranted. For Man's work ne'er can be original, Since all suggestions spring from former ones, And no self-called inventor but from the old Store takes a hundred fold more than he adds. Freely he took, and freely let him give. And if he choose to publish let him not Think counter things, to publish privily. But each mind drawing from the main should drop Therein its small dew-driblets, sprung therefrom. Besides what one found many more might find. Why, then, so block the many for the one. Thus with law-traps and thorns to beset the paths 'Tis as tho' some explorer happening first On Darien's narrow neck should thence forbid Both continents to after comers, tho', From their own onset, taking the same track. Such froward doltish hindrance we forbidâ Better, for signal merits, give State-meeds But few and sparely, after thoro' proof, Well weighedâfor worth is, mostly, its own reward. And since, the greed of hasty gain is Man's Main curse, and State-example lavishing Its public pay, kindles and feeds that greed. Hence should the State, as doth the Gospel, stamp Christ's simple pattern on its followers, Content with littleâneither exacting much, Nor spendingâsince to wring from toil its hard Earnings for idle waste, is wickedness Most wantonâsuch taxation is twice curs'd, To giver and taker; sparingness is thrift, And savingness salvation to State-weal. Needs too, a strong curb on official swayâ Manhood's sore canker and curse,âwhence likeliest, Freedom becomes corrupt, e'en to self-lossâ Better one lord, lion, nay wolf, than swarms Of vermin, crawling, teasing, stinging our blood; Making the common wealth a common waste For ass, goose, swine, by their base selfish greed Fast bound in braying, cackling, grunting league Against all earnestness of thriftier tilth. But like an ulcer, drawing from the whole Body, its lively working blood, to swell Their lazy foulnessâSo the mischief grows. And so self-life, self-help, self-will, self-worth Are lost, and self-love only left: to live Jew-like, by jobbery, shams, o'erreaching wilesâ Therefore resolve we that the standard of pay For all State-hirelings, high or low, shall be The ploughman's daily wage reckon'd in wheat: And other work, as each, compared therewith Hath more or less of hardship, skill and worth, So be it paid proportionate thereto. Statesmen or judge by the units multiple, Service unskilled or slight by its minuple: But higher than tenfold no rate shall be, Unless our after Council otherwise Ordain, for offices of special charge. And since a private master gives not pay To former hirelings, neither shall the State: Which to all ruled by it should show a true Pattern of thriftânot, as oft seen, of waste. The head betraying to a vermin horde The bodyâbut henceforth wage is for work Alone, unless for wounds disabling itâ But, lest thrift fail, one twentieth from all pay Shall be abated for a pension fund. And since Man's greed is but a blind snow-ball Gathering wealth, not for its worthy use And comfort; but for self-prideâso to say, Beholdâadmire meâbiggest of snow-ballsâ Nayâof dung-heapsâcorruptive, when close-piled, Productive, when spread fairlyâWe must hence Further this fair spread: taxing bloated wealth With rising graduationâthat gold-greed Be checked; land-greed, yet worse, we've rooted out. And Poor-rates shall be drawn from Christian Love, Not Lawâso shall that Love slumbering now, Since superseded by forced doles and thence Less needed, yearn to its renewed strong need; Free from Law's iron bars and hateful screwsâ Thence willing hearts quickening helpful hands, May bind in kind communion wealth to want, And Faith, thro' works, feel her way heavenward. Further the people's danger is not now, From ruthless tyrants or from plundering mobs, But from their own corruption, idleness, Rankness, place-hunting, and place-holding rotâ Whereby the many are bribed to make the few Their rulers, who turn privilege to pelf: By secret sale of contracts, offices, Ownerships, till the plague corrupts the whole blood, Slackens the body, deadens working will: While wens like those claim pay and honour as heads. For who would strive when he could sit at ease And watch the storm-blown seamen from the shore Of calm official sham? This deadly sap To stay, behoves stern will and iron strength; For those blood-sucking swarms are keen, and they Who watch them, waiting to suck after them Yet keenerâto this root must the axe be laid. First by low salaries, next by Law's sharp lash, Scourging wrong-doersâthen competitive Foretrials, then by sifting choice of men, Earnest to serve the country for its sake, From zeal and conscience of their calling, as now Godly men serve Christ; asking not so much High wages, as a field for high-aimed work. Also be 'stablished shrewd committee-men, Strong-willed, stern, earnest, watchful against all Corruption, as fendykes-men against rats. Tax-pruners, to sift narrowly all new Outlay, and to report what can be saved And spared from the old. No new charge shall be set Unless two thirds of them shall vote for it. Nor any old retained by less than half. Nor shall the mainmote cancel their report By fewer than three-fourths of their full vote. So haply from its hirelings may the State Get as good work as private masters do, Not shammed or slurred as nowâa deadly shameâ Since from State-models others take their mould. Next, standard embassies, that stir more strife Than e'er they still, shall be forbiddenâand then And there, where needs arise, Statesmen be sent. And since, from hasty greed Fraud daily grows More rife, in trade, companies, bankruptcy; And since such roguery is worse than sheer Unblushing theft, more wasteful and dangerous: By sterner pains be all such frauds repress'd. And the old wholesome laws gainst usury From mawkish purblind sophistry repealed Be they renewed, with further stringency And strength, intensive and extensive tooâ That thrift may plod on steadily as erst, With small gains, helping trade, not spendthrift waste. Further, lives fleet like leaves, nor can the now Rule the after; hence the State, for wholesome check On loans, shall stake against them taxes, enough Ere twenty years, to clear themâso no son Shall bear his father's burdenâfor thence grow Wars, and all wasteâwho charged must discharge tooâ Further, since arts, professions, offices Are hugely overpaid, and greed in these More than in land-rents, field-work, handicraft, Trade-gains, and interest on public loans, Outswells the wise wont of our forefathers; And their high pitch mars the main harmony, As in a globe, which rolls not evenly, If here down-trampled, there to airy pride Puffed outâbe such excess reduced to rule. With field-work for a standard, whence to pay All these their worth comparative, more or less: So may their rate keep compass, as of old, Nor claim pounds now where pence were welcome thenâ This let the State begin, others will thence Followâand so the middle class, that holds And binds to a whole, the extremes, lofty and low, Trafficking 'twixt the two, partaking of each, And by its tempering means steadying both, May keep its level, nor forego as now, Rising too high, its means conservative. For the central stay of rest once shifted, each pole Swings wildly about, and chaos comes again. Lastly, no time shall run against folk-right. But fraud or wrong, when found, shall be redress'd, Tho' centuries come between: else proofs are rife (Since what concerns all, often concerns none) That scoundrels in high place will scoop this land, Finding means, openly or stealthily, To draw from it an everlasting drainâ Then the catch-pipe once set, they call their wrong A vested right; the more they 've plundered us The less our claim to wring them. Thus have Kings Burdened their misbegotten lustling sons On our hard earningsâThus by juggling tricks, Leases of folk-lands, sinecures, sham-suits, Exactions by law-makers for law-leave, Has many an idle wretch fatten'd on the blood Of our main bodyâand what one blood-sucker Gets, many covet; and sell body and soul For shameful hope of itâdeep and wide-spread This plagueâmust smite it sternly, root and branch: Nor only tear from our State-oak such foul Funguses, but withal make them disgorge From their back gains what can be got from themâ Therefore for thrift and against fraud, be named Shrewd and stern men, trustworthy from tried Truth, To watch and ward, sift thoro'ly, and vouch Or brand as bad all public claimsâeach year Reporting what's ill-spent, what can be spared. And public frauds shall feel the sharpest scourge Of Law; with wrongful gains repaid tenfold; That Fear may check whom Conscience never could. My friends these truths to me are sureâif so To you likewise, 'tis yours to make them rules. But take them not on trust for meâthey need A stronger warrant. To wise councillors Must be committed, and by them reframed. Lastly, since these and other righteous dues Are yet withholden from us by our Lords, With whom nor Right nor Reason availeth aught: And patience of their heavy oppression Doth but provoke them to heap wrong on wrong, As this poor land hath proved, under their power, Groaning and travailing in pain till now: Therefore be it resolved, there is strong need That we rise up from our long listlessness In arms, and so redress ourselves to right Manfully, as behoves good and true men. Brethren, ye have my conscience, my full mind, No learned trickery, but earnest Truth; For I've bestowed my whole life searching it. Ye've heard it in full meeting now, and singly Erewhile.âEach man with me and wiser heads Weighing it wellâin bulk, and bit by bit: And this my thought's hasty deliverance Hath been the offspring of slow ripening time. Then why stand here to make more words of it? Ye've heard the whole, answer me, aye or no; Is it your will? Do ye determine so?â He ended: and the throng that listened him So by his words were borne beyond self-will, That answer was spell-boundâall utterance lost In the eager audience. And, his speech done, After him came a billow-like heart-thrill To fill the void. Then a dark high-browed smith, Grimy, but stalwart, skilled of timely stroke To weld the iron in high flush of heat, Upcried, with his deep thunder of assent; And upon that, a shout tumultuous, Conclaiming, like a battery's general peal After the signal shot. It spoke a strength Manifold more in spirit than in show, That hundreds might seem thousands; and so strong Against the surly mountain side it struck As every voice had been a living thing, Yearning for utterance. Then a glad fire Kindled in Hermann's eye, to feel their hearts Swelling to meet his own; pulse against pulse, Deep answering deep; and thus his soul spake out: âBrethren and friends, 'tis wellâ Ye've said itâand what power can gainsay? Not all the host of Hell Shall now withstand your will, or bar your forward way. We're risen up, and where's the mighty hand Shall smite us down? We're risen up to win unto this land Her old renown: Her high blood-bought prerogative To teach the nations how to live: Erst it was an idle boast, Least vouchsafed when vaunted most; But the lie is now made true, Thanks to ye and honour due, Due to ye all, and to your patriot worth, And to the blessed land that sent ye forth. Yes, hail to thee, my glorious motherland! For glorious shalt thou be, Thou that hast borne this holy brother band, All hail to thee! Men shall look to thee from far As to some lone shining star, Shining in the dead of night For a lofty guiding light. Now the patriot-glow I feel, Now the thrilling burning zeal Never felt for thee before, Vassal'd as thou wert of yore. For who in his most fond imaginings Could love thee, crouching then Beneath those curs'd o'erlording creeping things Instead of men? Things that had crawled unto their height Thence to rule thee in the right Of their fangs and poisonous power. But, thanks to God, they have fulfilled their hour. Mother of Freedom, yes, I greet thee now, Thy travail o'er; There beams a high soul'd beauty from thy brow, Was not before. And ever brighter glance thy fountains; And ever higher swell thy mountains; And all for pride that thou art grown To stand amid the world alone: Stand aloft while others bow To thee above them, for their Queen art thou: And before thy full-orbed sway Lesser lights must fade away. I greet thee with clasped handsâand ye around Bare ye your feet, for here is holy ground: And mark the spot and set a sign thereon, A stedfast sign, to bide when ye are gone: Some stone-heaped altar on the lone hill-side Young Freedom's monument, and the far pilgrims' guide. And seeâthis dayâhow brightly doth it shine! A heavenly token, yes, a goodly sign! But brighter yet, and yet more heavenly clear Its future radiance foredestined for each year: As now on us, so on our memories thenâ A day of thanks to God, of gladness among men: In holy honour second but to one, That blessed day that gave the Saviour Son: Saviour alike and leveller of man, Godly Reformer, Arch-Republican: For what are we but workers of His will? As He foretold e'en so do we fulfil. Then in this surety gird ye each his sword, And in your swelling souls receive the Lord; Receive Him there, and there He will abide, A saving power, Almighty on our side. Oh! 'tis a heavenly mission that we claim; Your scope is high, and be your souls the same: Fearless of all such fear as worldlings feel, Each dread, each doubt, consumed in blazing zeal; A zeal that never cares, tho' well it knows, Of perils swarming on the path it goes: Looking but to its glorious end on high, And flashing back that glory from its eye: Whate'er befal enduring all alike, Hate, hardship, death, will suffer or will strike. Careless of gainâayeâcounting all for lossâ All else but Christ, His crown, but first, His cross. Such is the spirit, that must speed us on Another way than other men have gone. Yes, brethren, mark me wellâanother wayâ And further, straighter, surer, too, than they. Ah! if it were not so, the thought were vain: But one link more to lengthen out our chain. That chainâ'twas the fiend took the blacksmith's trade, And wrought it from each broken patriot blade Shivered how madly, 'gainst the strong State-tower; But what we purpose, none e'er dared before: Then who shall say our truth is vainly tried? Others have passed away, our standard shall abide. The flimsy traitor-fools this land hath known Were frighted at the shadow of the throne, And fell, uncared of all, who cared but for their own. So dastard fear is father to its fate, But rebel greatness must be boldly great: Brethren, we know it wellâand what we know Our knowledge in our daring must we show. Ours is no stealthy plot, no swindler's prize For thievish hand-sleight and for slavish liesâ Away all tangled tricksânone such do we devise. Noâlet the mighty mass display its power, Broad as the banner o'er some sovran tower: The mighty mass that never raised its head While factions squabbled, and while lordlings bled; But now, resentful of its stolen right Shall brandish its high hand and rush into the fight. Then, its foes scattered, on its sword shall rest In conscious strength, to Freedom self-redrest. A lion majesty, whose mood none dares molest. Hark! hear ye not? 'tis the free angel's sweep, Stooping to stir the fountains of the deep: And lo! a mighty flood shall level all, New powers arise, and olden empires fall, Joy to ye, brethren, joyâfor many are they Whose livelong spirits yearned to see this day, And saw it not, but past in frustrate hope away. That sightâthat holy workâis all our own, By God's free grace. O let us give Him worship kneeling down Here in this place. We have been a brotherhood True and holy, fast and good: I, your Minister, and ye Children of my ministry: Hearers of the Word I preach, Livers of the life I teach, Zealous of the Gospel cause 'Bove the world and worldly laws. So, of late, I deemed ye allâ Is it now the time to fall? Shamefully to fall aloof Bidden thus to bide the proof? Noâit would grieve me soreâ Shall this our house on God's rock edified Fall loosely, as on some sandshore, Cowering to the onset of the tide? Full often have I preached and prayed with you, Communing, soul and mind: And now, the time is come that we should do What we designed! Up, my troth-fellows, and fulfil What ye profess'd, your patriot will. This paper that I tear And scatter it in air, 'Tis our foe's proclamationâaway, their old Rag-ruleâbut our new folk-swayâlook, beholdâ Its glorious fresh banner thus do I unfold.â Fervency, thou'rt indeed a god-like gift, Kindling the whole man to one glowing heart, For soul to meet in sympathy with soul: Melting the mass, else rough, to thoro' flow, And blending many men to a whole mindâ Strange sorcery! such fervent faculty Had Hermannâfirst, to take, then spread the fire From the live torch he was. In the orator Nature is chiefest art; and the flowing soul Bears all away in its flood. That multitude Mixed of so many unlikely men, now breathed But one conspiracy. The brotherhood, Nine hundred souls and more, faithfully tried, Long tried, and trusted late, drunkard scarce one, Gambler or spendthrift; bound together in bonds Of holy love and zeal, stronger than iron, Warmer than blood, more trusty than all oaths, They were the foremost hope: in spirit alike, And in strength tooânext, some much ranker stuff, For where is there a river flows so clear But hath some mud at bottom? Loutish men, Of loutish clayâa clay trodden to mire In the world's foul traffic, living as a scab Upon the surface and coarse skin of life. Whoso were skilled to read man's character Had scarce misread them then as they stood there, Wearing their souls outside: outscorning scorn That fain would fasten on their raggedness, By daring of their eye and weather'd brow, Bronzed beyond blushing shame: smugglers some few, And poachers more, branded by Law, but thence Among their fellows enhanced all the higher For hardihood. 'Tis evil when the Law Blows 'gainst the folks' tide, chafing and swashing it To billows. Such were theyâa rough alloy Haply may harden that pure gold for work; For such worn offcast iron is doughtier Since hacknied in world-ways: needs not o'er-nice Hand-tools to mar the old stuff, and mould the new. Truly our low-lived lungs cannot away With such bright air as nobler spirits breathe Aloft: the purest Truth, yet if it flow Down from a height more heaven-like than earth, Doth lose to worldly sense its likelihood, And seems but falling vapor. To coarse maw Behoves coarse diet; but words are only words: Time with the deed tries all. So did it them, And sooner than they thought. In their mid gush Of joy, while yet it sparkled as wine outpoured, With busy greetings and warm clasping hands, All in a wild upstir tumultuous, None knowing to what endâsudden there ran A catchword thro' that crowd, darkening brows, Compressing every lip. âThey comeâSee there: The redcapsâYesââso shouted Linsingen, Looking where other eyes were all agaze; Then, as he turned, flashing from 'neath his brow Defiance yet more dangerous than he spoke; âYesâ'tis no lessâand would it were much moreâ A hundred pikes outfought were more renown Than a score shatter'd staves. Let them come on: And weâwe'll break their sticks upon their backs, And kick them home again. What? are we babes? Or yon poor scurvy fellows, whom ye all know, Are they grown giants? And who leads them on? 'Tis heâthe very manâthe bull-frog squireâ Who wronged me foullyâwe'll now square it offâ Yet mark meâstir nor shout as they come upâ Let them begin.â So bidden so they stood, That noiseless stern self-trusting brotherhood: Not longâfor on they came, the sheriff's band, Slowly as in solemnity of Law, Steady and slow: that the uproarious crew Might break away, and flee, striking no stroke, Self-routed by their fear: e'en as they came Boldly, those brethren stood abreast to them Nothing abashedâhalted the main, within Half-gunshot; and their leader, riding forth Till his restive horse stopp'd short before the staves, Thus spoke. âWhat means this sudden meeting here, By Law unwarranted? Wellâif ye're dumb, 'Tis I must speakâaway thenâto your homesâ Else must I do what would displease me much, And ye, who must abide it more. Bewareâ Once more then, to your homesââHe paused and stood, Looking in hurried wonderment around Who first should answer himâAnswer was none, But such a shout of laughter as 't might seem A mob of jeering devils and not men That stood before him. He had armed himself Against whate'er of outrage might befal; Screwing determination to its height To abide the worst. 'Gainst danger he was steel'dâ But scornâAh noââWhat, are ye rebels then, Ye ragged scoundrels?âbut I tell ye thisâ I bear the Law's commission: dare ye aught Against me, ye shall rue it and right soon. I forewarn thoseââ âWhat,â shouted Linsingen, âWhat mean ye with your silly dangling scrap? Go, tell your master that he send a man If ever he would deal with us again, Not such an angry chattering ape as thouâ Dost think to swagger our free manhood down With thy big words? away and hold thyself Lucky for that good leave.â Ere he had said He snatched the reins, forth springing suddenly, From the rider's hand; and with a forceful wrench, And sharp compression of the curb, forced back Upon his haunches the unruly horse Uprearing at the alarm. Then that proud soul Was all one flaming rage. He raised his hand To strike, but younger blood foresped his aim, And ere that hand its earnest could fulfil The head that prompted it was smitten down By a sharp bludgeon strokeâfrom his horse he fell, And lay, unlike with life to rise again, A senseless length of limb. Wild was the outery Fierce the uproar that rose upon that deed, Ere yet full done. Up rushed those followers Up to their fallen leader, to help his fall, Help or avenge. Then came the clash of staves; Conflicting skulls and stonesâbruises and bloodâ Curses and oathsâonshout and wild dismayâ Struggle bewildering on that rugged ground. All the fell spirit of strife. But what are reeds Encountering spears? How should a few score men Backed and embolden'd by the Law alone, How should they stand 'gainst many hundreds' strength, A strength inflamed to deepest dourest glow By its own fire. That force, when highest strained Was but a stone flung 'gainst the mountain side, In overweening rashness, suddenly Stopped. They fall back, o'erborne by the onward rush, They, erst so haughty and loud, now in wild flight Or downcast, body and soul alike, in mire, Can but cry mercyâas woman in her throes, With faint beseeching moan. But victory Hears only what wrath thunders in its ear, And nought beside: then had their prayers been The heralds of their spirits unto death: But what was best and noblest in that throng, Hess, Hermann, Linsingen, many more, rushed To hinder ruthless bloodshed, sudden in, Quick as the outcry called: they stayed the hands Uplifted o'er those helpless struggling heads; O'erawed rash fierceness with calm earnestness, Raised the down-stricken, and back commending them To go the way they came; âWhen ye come next Be ye either furnished with a better force, Or else prepared to meet a worser doom. And look to him your leaderâhe's but stunnedâ And now himself again; aye, and we hope A wiser man than ever yet he was: Go, take him with ye.â All lowly and forlorn, From their late bravery bruised into pale Bloody dismay; hurried and shamefelly They left that field, cursing it as they left. While e'en their foes, tho' victors, yet, as ceased The strife, their spirits did subside with it, From fire to smould'ring smoke; as a pale child Shrinks back aghast from fording the strange flood; And the few steps he hath adventured it, Feels not so much of hope from their success, As cold discouragement from danger, seen Widening still to his eye, and deepening Suddenly: in such fear had the many failed But for the few. Like some lone Alpine peak, Eiger or Jungfrau, or the horn of Aar, In twilight, when all little things are dimmed, Itself high-towering stands against the gloom, Then clearest, and most stern determinate Of project; so they stood, those leaders there Armed against Fate, each in his own soul-fire: Linsingen, rash as lightning, of wealth and life Alike profuse, as the heart of its own blood: Wrathful 'gainst those who scorned him formerly When weak, and now must fear: dreaming high dreams By the Harper hinted him. Hess, a stern soul Madden'd against the idol of his hate, Writhing 'gainst wrong, and gnashing spiteful teeth To wreak it. Next, the unselfish devout faith Of Hermann, spirit of grace, whom Nature reared Child-like, in her soul-strengthening solitude; And with lone prayers, and feeling thoughtfulness Hallowed him unto God: whose glory he aimed, And good of manânought elseâin their success Sure of his own. So, tho' unlike, those lamps Yet shone together, comforting the folk, And they were comforted. God speed them on; As sure, his hand hath strengthened them thus far. BOOK VIII. Oh, mighty Man! lord of this goodly earth! Thy lordship but shows forth thy littleness; For thy low life dwarfs down even the huge And stately globe that doth belong to it, To the sand-grain, that's all in all to itâ Such as it is, against the Universe, E'en such thou art, against what thou should'st be. Oh! if angels could laugh, what merry shouts Would shake the vault of heaven; to see this ball, This wondrous ball, rolling in endless room, With such a pigmy bragging from its perch, This power and glory is mineâyet 'tis not thatâ To be the dwindled body that thou art, I scorn thee not: for greatness is in good, Not good in great; but thou'rt a dwarf in soul, 'Fraid of thyself with a most silly fear: Yes, truly, afraid of thy most silly selfâ Nayâbut thy shadowâfor in very truth, The world's Opinion, unsifted, is nought elseâ A shadow, yet in dark o'erruling awe, Most strong, although its substance is so weak. Truly, when God gave Reason for thy gift He knew thee wellâa trimmerâa weathercock, Unworthy of so high godly a grace; And so withal He gave thee something else Beside the Reason that thou could'st not rule, And would'st not listen when it should rule theeâ Something might suit thee better, a half-thing, Nay, unthingânought but a nameâOpinionâ Much liker truth to call it apishness; However called, a grovelling slave in kindâ Slave of the Alazonocracy, self-styled Aristocrat: yet crawling from slave bonds As other eunuchs do, to sovereign sway. Such is Opinion, also called the public: Flimsy and fickle; yet by noodledom Upcried for surety and substanceâliar!âavaunt! The publicâwhat is thatâthe people! ah, noâ But floating o'er it, like a lazy scum O'er the wholesome working stream: a flighty cloud Of many hues, no shapeâshifty and slight; Begotten by light newsreadings on brains Yet washier; idle and wayward, cowardly And selfish, for so wealthy leisure is wont; Sick of its own stagnation, and for lack Of wholesome working channels to drive will's Stream onward, craving like a froward child, Ever some new strange and sense-stirring show; Slander or ruin, earthquake, gossip-toy, To draw its soul from its own sink: and hence Tho' fearful, it loves war for excitement's sake, And loathes, as mere stagnation, steady peace. Would'st have a sample of its soul? look there, On yonder crowd of helpless countrymen, Untaught, yet teachable, kind-hearted, mild, Most patient under most oppressive rule, Summoned as wrongdoers, for their good work Wrought on waste ground in faith of their full right; They stand, unarmed, unware, thinking no ill, Wayworn, in loose talk waiting the award: But seeâthat sheet of fire, that storm of shot, Those shrieks, those yells, this sudden slaughter strange, What means it? it means nought but the coward hate And outrage of bloodthirsty, rancorous hearts, Madden'd by their own panic. Those who o'erlive Flee wildlyâfind and seize weapons hard by. Turn on the trampler and slay the slaughterer. Was ever rage more righteous? but noâRulers Can ne'er be wrong; resistance never right. Tho' a drunk soldier strike ye all downâwho cares? Must drown their manly spirit in their bloodâ Up then, cries cowardly State-flunkeydom, Upâplay the devil in God's nameâshoot, smite, Burn all the countryâhomesâcropsâhavock allâ Spare noneâwhoe'er flees from ye shoot him down, Guilty or notâno oddsâonly make one Hell of the whole black countryâturn not, ere Ye've done that duty. Well, they did itâclean And clearâwondrously wellâglory to God! There then Opinion! there thou Public! swill Thy fullâthey have set running for thy thirst Hogsheads of bloody excitementâat the news Up they throngânoodles, doodles. The whole soft Handed, hard hearted Alazonocracy, With its flunkeys, clinging, draggling at its tail, And proud to be so fouled by it. In they rush Gloating on cheap thrilling bloodstirââAh, good, Why this is talk indeedâstirs us right thro'. Worth living forâthey got it well, those slavesâ That dared kill backâbut the heroesâhip-hurrah. True Toriesâscrunched the workmenâTories true. They've given us a week's sensationâa month's. Crowns and white robes for themâmake them knights, peers. Spout, pray for themâshout, sing, subscribe for them. Aye, well ye may, so doth the Devil tooâ But God, o'erseeing all, overlooks noneâ And when the day comes, as come surely it will, And the black man in manhood shall uprise Backed by his warrior brethren, conquerors Of the south, to avenge sternly this hell-blotch; Then will the noodle public look aghast; Draw a faint, fearful breath, and each in the slouched Ears of his brother; âthat sensation of ours So cheap, looks now as tho' it might come dear. What, war, and soldiers among Christian men, Bloodshed, and six-pence more of income-tax! And those our heroes, now so unhero-like! Ah horror! who'd have thought it?â Nay thy thoughts Thou noble noodle, to sound deepest truths, Are something shallow. Thine is no thought-brain: Its emptiness but echoes noodledom Needlessly. To thy brethren then, away! Doodle and Foodle, Poodle, Toodle and allâ We want the stage clear for the working-manâ We'll none of them, nor theeânor of this same Most puffy public, that now monkey-like Oe'rrules the people: and thou, Noodledom, For thy idols fear notâthou hast set them upâ We tooâupset themâweep not; for thy mud Heroes, mud-daubed with blood, are easy made. But henceâavauntâwith thy fool trashâfor now 'Tis Manhood's timeâWe must bethink us wellâ Henceforth the people's Conscience, how unlike Public Opinion, that old flaunting jade, In true self-sure weal-working righteous Faith Shall lead life onward. So God grant it, and so Evermore speed it. But for this we lack Earnestnessâshams to scout, needs to fulfil: Sheer and straightforward the folks' work to do. No fear, no favourâSuch is not the world's Wont, as Opinion sways it hitherto. Therefore, ye lower kinds, matched against man, Ye overpeer him: for that goodly gift Of Mind, ye never owned nor wronged its worth: Belying Truth by idle phantasies, Eating the husk, flinging away the fruit With froward wantonnessâunreasoning Reason, to set world-wisdom on her throne, As man is wontâforegoing the sun's light, To walk with smoky lampsâYes, ye dumb things, Ye're there our betters, and I bow to ye: For your poor talent to the full ye avail; While we, unheeding, sink our lofty one, In our soul-slough. 'Tis no fond tale men tell Of an Evil Angel that o'ersways this world; And thou Opinion, art he. Ah! who can tell How great a sum of good thou'st blown away With thy fool's breath? How oft, when souls have yearned To do some Truth, which Reason prompted them; Opinion hath looked coldly on their warmth, Blighting it in the bud: or else hath worn So withering a devil in its sneer, That Virtue hath shrunk back from manly choice To silly childhoodâfearing to do well, Lest men should deem it ill: taking for judge Fashion instead of Conscience. Thou mak'st Man A huge machine, moved by some outer will, Weening strange vanitiesâa monkey, an ape, Looking unto his neighbour's to begin And lend his soul its start. Yes, poverty Of means and money, knowledge and of hope, Hath chilled some heartsâhundredsâthousands may beâ Their lofty aspirations to forego, But thou hast stifled many millions. Stifled them with the drouthy high-way dust, Flinging it in their eyes, and mouths, and ears That they must neither see, nor hear, nor speak Save thy own trash. Yet is there not a thing Men call Religion, lives it not and breathes, And do not worshippers bow down to it? Then wherefore? but to free us, once for all, From the world to God. Set then Religion up, And pull Opinion down: ruling new lines From our new centre. What the heathen once Upheld, for lack of higher worthiness This silly law and sillier fear of the world, Away with all that rubbish! In its stead How goodly high a building shall arise, One Christian temple, a worthy dwelling-place For the Holy Spirit? But for this, needs first That every man look up to God's right rule, Not to his crooked neighbour's; holding world Wont for the blind child of its blind foredrift, And parent of world-wisdom; mud and mire And muckâsuch parentage, such progeny. But then shall Truth ask boldly, is this good? Careless of all skulking complacency With foes of Right and Freedom. So shall Man Become a being of high impulses, And true self-searching will, as meant by God, Unslaved from worldly sway! steering his course By his own helm, not wildly blown adrift, The waif of trivial wont. A man indeed, And no machine. Then shall that fashion vain, Misnamed Opinion fade from Reason's light, E'en as a cloud dissolved in a blue sky. Wisdom shall walk abroad and cry aloud, And the unbelieving scoffer, assailing her, Shall blunt his last shaft on her heavenly shield, And chattering his vain rage shall flee Man's faceâ Ayeâgood: go herd with apes. Thenceforth, no more Shall Man fear Man, most wretched in his fear, But, loving God, be happy in his love. Happy to love, and happier yet to do What loving Wisdom bids him. Then, tho' he stand But one against a host, he will stand fast And ne'er give back: as knowing that Highest One, Stronger than all the millions of this world, Who upholds him that hath a righteous cause, And abides boldly by it. Such is he, So main of might, who feels such faithfulness In strength of Truth, and of his sturdy self To meet the blind old giant, Prejudice. And such were they, who then, on that hill-side Reckless of fears and losses, smiles and frowns, Of bayonets, swords, death; caring no straw Of what men said, but only what God willed; Set up the standard of Truth, Freedom and Love, Sure stars for Faith to steer by. Which shall win, The world or they? He who foresees afar, He only knows: well, be it whiche'er may, Only God speed the right: as surely He will, And all the more, if righteousness 'gainst wrong Struggling, shall need His aid for furtherance. And they were in that stress: and that high hand Came to their help. Their foes' discomfiture They had wrought out boldly and manfully: And next, that sorry and unseemly flight They witnessed, as befitted Manhood best, In calmness of disdain, no ruffian Outbreak, nor boyish shout, nor laugh or jee ; Rather with brow and lips sternly compressed Against what next should come: knowing this bout Was but a trial of fence with blunted foils, Preluding pointed danger and bloody death To some or all. Such upstir is hard to keep Screwed to its pitch, from downfal. But being cheer'd By those brave leaders, then came thoro' will To comfort themâthey stood, strong and high-manned Beyond whate'er before their warmest Faith Deemed itself possible. Conversion strange, Yet sure to true soulsâfor their daring spirit Outlives the daring deed; and the plunge made, The glow comes after itâsleeping erewhile At the heart, but now upspringing to the head, And spreading vivid life thro' the whole frame. So they, scatter'd in clumps, or crowding round To hear some earnest speaker, held their rede, What next they should essay. âWe've lucked it here, And will hereafterâbut nowâshall we push Or wait the proof?â Must wait; for sudden, in sky The hurrying clouds met, as forewarned to meet, Each in its lightning instinct rushing on To make one massy darkness overhead: Else a clear blue all roundâone thunder-stroke, And then a profuse deluge bursting down, In gush full spouted; as tho' all the air Were turned to water. âHa! friends! what may 't mean? So shouted a strong voice amid the din: One onset we stood out, and beat it off, But here's a stronger yet and fiercer one. Well, we're but men; and here 'tis Heaven itself Proclaims we should be gone; therefore away, Each to his home or shelter wheresoe'er: For counsel speaks not in such storm as this, Nor hearsâwhere next we meet soon shall ye know.â 'Twas Linsingen that spakeâso spoken and doneâ For all, with first one cheer for their good cause, Went several ways; in clusters, ten or twelve, Home-thronging: for the weaker soul stands not In its own strength; but in the threatening hour Must lean for comfort on some friend beside, Or fallâbut higher minds suffice themselves, Needing no talkmates but their inward thoughts: And the work they finish in society They love to frame that work in solitude. Hermann was such a soul; and in such wise, While the other men, in noisy fellowship Went each his homeward way; secret and still, As the unquiet hare winds her shy stealth, So did he wind his own round the hill's brow, Threading the thickest heather, and gorse, and fern. Where only some sheep-tracks left their faint show, Wide of the vulgar. Far as his eye could Was wild, and ever wild, and wilder still, As he were the last man: no hovel near, No shed, nor sheltering treeânor needed much. For the head long rain, ere this, had spent itself, Swift as a diver's plunge. And now from her sleep, A living fairy spirit of fresh green, Daughter of the giant storm, breathing like balm, Jewelled with sundrops, looked out lovingly, With soft yet sparkling smile. Hermann smiled tooâ Despite his doomâand, as he gazed around, Suddenly the bright beauty of that scene Lit up with lustre his sad countenance In like complacency. 'Tis a blest turn Away from moody and turmoiling man And from our selfish taskmistress the World, To our mother and nurseâto thee, Nature, for thou Art both those tendernesses in one word. He who hath aught of feeling must feel thisâ And he who feels it notâno more of himâ That soul is dead. So in his buoyancy Hermann strode on, touched by the seraph fire In heart, not tongue: storing the golden gifts Nature poured inâstaying anon to look With lingering Love; as one who lived the fair Landscapeâhe drew, that eve, a deep, pure draft From the bosom of the mother that he loved: A draught that did refresh his inmost soul Sick of its daily trash: and his soul grew With that good diet an expansive growth, Swelling as it would burst its bars of flesh And so be free: living a heavenly life; Communing with its Maker there aloft, Above the world of men: heeding them not, Neither their promises nor puny threats, As being in higher presence. Who would rise Above his fellows in his spirit's height, And do great deeds in lofty daringness; Let him go leave awhile their fellowship, Betake him to the mountain or lone wood, And sitting soothly there at Nature's feet Feel her great truths: look upward unto her, Then down upon the world. Thus Hermann then: And whatsoe'er doubt had misgiven him, It vanished from his soul like to a mist In the sun's radiance. So he wound his way Thoughtfulâuntil he came to a lone treeâ A kingly oak, so deeply rooted in Eld, That who would trace it back to its acorn birth Was lost in unknown years. Men paid to it Weird reverence, and fancy deepen'd the awe That Nature had enveloped it withal, As with a prophet's mantle. On that wild ridge It stood, standard of Eld; springing alone From its own shade, that seemed to shadow forth Its dark Druidic birth: one left of all: All that wild mystic worshipful old wood That once bore sway of the hills; its brethren's pride Erewhile, but now their mournful monument, Left in its lone bereavement but for note Of boorish bounds. He saw it, and he sighed: For yet, tho' rugged, it brought back to him Not unrefreshfully his child-like mood; Reliving those gay far-off holidays, When clownish revelry 'neath these wide boughs Was wont to celebrate its summer wake; And he among the throng of revellers A laughing boy. That old tree spake to him Soothingly, as some fairy tale first told To the boy, and heard again after grey years By the careworn man. E'en so it spoke to his heart; And his heart answered it: he turned aside From the pathway, and sat him underneath On a huge bole forth bulging from its stem, There to ponder the past. 'Tis a sad thing To retrace step by step our mazy life, And find, what should have been a forward track Straight as an arrow started from the string To be a wild self-cross'd perplexity, A hurry without speed: and at the end Farther from its mark than the beginning was: Farthest of all from its good. To see it, Hope Sickens, and Faith is fool'd. Therefore we're blind Wilfully: none looks home withinâbut onâ Doggedly on; never bethinking him Whither and why, but ever round and round Narrowly reeling in the self-same ring, As wise as any other whirligig. Such is our folly; and to reframe his life By rule of righteousness from man to God, That were our wisdomâbut, ohâWisdom and Manâ Who yokes ye both together, he is a fool, For ye're no yoke-fellowsâbut why more words? Alas! our folly speaks itself too plain. And Hermann's thoughts were darkâdeeply he mused So deeply, that desire o'erflowed in tears, Dreaming those daysâwishfully breathed his spirit And wildly, more than words can utter it. Lone old Oak, and how is it with thee? Tell meâfor thou Years ago did'st overshadow meâ Dost mind me now? Mind meânoâthou'st shelter'd and forgotten Far better men: Better far than I are dead and rotten, To dust agen. But thou! in my heart thy memory Hath deeper root: Manhood kneels before thy majesty With homage mute. Dear old OakâI love and worship theeâ For on thy rugged bark Thousand years lost in eternity Have left their mark. Here thou standest, while they fleeted o'er: Then in thy prime Heeding not the whetting tusk of boar: Nor now the scythe of Time. Would I had thy arms of giant-might To embrace thee nowâ Iâthe dwarfâcan but uplift my sight To thy dark brow. Prithee, say; tho' thou regardest not Such things as I, Where are all the hours that on this spot I idled by? Ah, that falling leaf whispersâthey're onâ They might not bideâ On and upward I too should have gone Upon their tide. Thither, for the haven of God's bliss, Far, far awayâ Their report of me is only this; Here would he stayâ Lingering here behind them listlesslyâ Ever 'mong these Hills and woods loitering in dreameryâ Like a vague summer breeze; Sighing here, and sinking there to sleep; And then again Waking up, and 'mid the woodlands deep Shouting amain. Nature, all I had I gave it thee. Tell me, wilt thou As I gave it freely, even as free Requite me now? Vainly else this world do I defy If in the end 'Gainst so fierce a foe thou dost deny To be my friend. Vainly else I've haunted wood and hill Wandering far: If I must be poor in spirit still As others are. Other worldlings who drag wearily, Yet hug their chain: All unfeeling of Faith, Love and thee And call it gain. Gold and silver, all that men do prize I left behind: So thro' thy communion I might rise To height of mind. Height of mind above the worldly man, And worldly aim: I've fulfilled my promise and my plan. Do thou the same. Give the proof of this thy discipline: That men may see All their thoughts are dwarfish things to thine, As they to thee. What I am ten thousand purple forms Glorious and free, Sunshine, thoughtful shade, and sea, and storms Are summed in me. In each hopeful dawn, each high noon sway I saw my sign. In the dying glory of the day I welcom'd mine. They are goneâbut their deep memories Ever remain; Blent thro' all my heart in harmonies Of soul-like strain. For I gazed upon thy glory and strength Treasuring it so, Till I deemed it all my own at lengthâ Is it or no? 'Mong thy lonely hills I wrought me steel, And a sword I made. A strange potency thou did'st reveal To bless that blade. Now I go to prove that potency, If it be true: Thou hast taught me, wilt thou strengthen me, And guide me through? Yesâthou wiltâfor lo! I look around Thy lofty rangeâ Still thou art, as ever thou wert foundâ Brooking no change. Still thy mountains are as towering high, Thy woods as green: Still thy soul thro' river, moor, and sky Is felt and seen. And that same high spirit I then knew Doth comfort me: Man is false, but thou art ever trueâ I trust in thee. He spoke those words, and rose, in their glad spirit; And rising, heard a sound borne on the air So still and sunny gentle until then, As of a wind in woods. âSo spoke the Lord To Davidâholy tokenâhail to thee Thou dost bespeak me fair.â The sound grew onâ And, as it grew, clearness grew out of it, To mark its meaning: a faint sough in the air, At first, and then a rush as of chafed waves, Lastly, the distinct clattering certainty Of horses gallop. He looked forth, and his eye Affirmed his ear: e'en up his track they came Some three-score men, spurring on eagerly, Loose-reined, careless of soldierly array, 'Mid panting steam of lather'd bloody horse flanks, As speed to them were suretyâof their foes No reckoning, but forwardâon they rode, Reckless, out-galloping the hearing first, And then the sightâHermann gazed after them From 'neath his sheltering oak, a stone's-throw wide, And saw their meaning clear as the men selves: âLord, in thy hands we're safe: all thanks to thee. Thou didst come down to us in that sharp storm, Scattering our strengthâbetokening favour there, Wherein some fainter spirits foreboded fearâ And so those men sent forth to hew us down, Or bind us, chains and death, baffled of blood Must back. May we, as surely, under Thee, Speed forward to our hope. Thou'st willed it, and I Worship thy will.â He knelt and prayed; then on Calm in his conscious faithâa godly calmâ To his destined end; the cottage, whither Love Led him, for her dear sake who dwelt in it: Nor only Love, but his most fearful need For her sire's counsel. For where danger is great And strength but small; behoves shrewd skill, to quit The oddsâand truly, Danger frowned on them So deadly, seemed not Danger now, but Death Outright; with his self-shadow, dark Despair, To the chilled soul foreboding himâbut God's Trust is so sure and thoro' in self-proof, That whoso feels it, reckons all alike Danger and devils and the mumbling witch With her cross-straws. Such trust Hermann then felt And well behoved him to be strong in it, His only strengthâ He went, ever along O'er vale and wood, moorlands and craggy heights, Where years ago his childish wonderment Would gaze itself to visionary awe, Hour after hour, spell-bound: but Nature shows A mirror to reflect upon the soul Its changeful self: and Mind, the maker, hath power To give to what it will, what shape it will, After its likeness and own mood within, From God's creationâSo, walking those hills In lofty gait and stateliness of soul, They did seem changed from what his childhood deemed; Changed in his spirit's change o'er-towering them; Dwarfed down as vassalage to majesty Beneath the wide projection of his thoughts. âYe proud snow-peaks, ye're but a footstoolâa baseâ For pride like mine to fly from.â So he spake, Rebuking his own o'erweening hopes, With show of self-scorn: scoffing his soul's deep EarnestnessâDanger thou art drear for who But looks on theeâYet heâthe patriot man Who boldly handles thee, and breathes thy breath, Thrilling throughout him, blent in thy embrace, For him that drearness becomes dour: he makes thee, (Yes, e'en of the foul incubus thou wert To those who lay supine beneath thy weight), A fiery winged-horse, to carry him High o'er the heads of men, upturned to gaze On his career in wonder from belowâ Ayeâand tho' he fall short of the topmost height To be a glory and guide star there above Fixed as the firmament in deathless fameâ Wellâand what then? He fails not, tho' he fallâ Danger, thou'rt ice unto the shivering skin But a doughty dram to the heart. Hermann drank deep, And so found comfort where erst faintness wasâ 'Twas evening; and Nature languidly As tired by steep toil of the summer day Sank downâthe sloping sun was seen, as the ghost Of one about to die by Highland Seer, His winding sheet outstretched e'en to his throat, Soon to foreclose the whole. So but an are Of the fire-globe shone yetâthe rest cut sheer Away by the sharp edge of the sky line; When Hermann, late to come, came there at last, Whither his heart forewinged him all the way, To his dear Lucy's home. 'Twas a blest time For such a soul as heretofore was he, Full of sweet silent thoughts, and feeling soothly In summer eve their fond congenial flow: There was a graciousness in th' air, might soothe Any stray devil to forget himself, And feel an angel's joy: joy in his God And in the sight of others' blessedness By fellow-feeling adopted for its own. It seemed, as tho' all light, colour and shape Had then been fresh created for that show They shone so bright. Hermann looked up to Heaven, And round on Earth's sun-glowing loveliness; âAnd all this happiness, so peaceful and fair, That an angel messenger, his duty done, Might gladly tarry here, and oft look back Wishful, tho' heavenward winged, why should my rash Unruliness upstir it?â Sagely he asked; But froward Will ne'er starved for lack of words: And whate'er Reason asks, that froward Will Hath answer ready on its own behalf, Self-wise, self-warranted. âAye, true 'tis good And wondrous fair, this world wherein we live, And therefore is more need to raise Man up To a height worthy of his dwelling-place; Lest like the Egyptian ape, the grovelling god Shame his great temple. Manhood to uplift, That is my workâon with itââ There is a state Wherein the lover of Nature often lives, Oftenest in the evening dream-light: Confounding sense with soul: each blent in each, Neither wholly itselfâno soul, no sense, But a calm joy made of their confluence; Receiving on its surface many hues, And back reflecting then as it receives, Taking none to its depth. Then doth the eye Communicate its office with the mind, The mind with the eye; and sense and thoughtfulness Are mingled in one spiritual being; And all is feeling. So did Hermann's soul, Floating in airy rapture, deeply drink Those evening forms and colours, like some cloud Dyed with the crimson sun; long-lingered he, Or e'er he broke the bonds of that sweet dream, For still something of doubt o'erruled the love That led him onward: so he sate awhile Wavering like the breezy grass around, O'erlooking that dear home: till a quick step Startled him from behind, and turning round, Old Walter's greeting startled him yet more With a fear, tho' fanciful, not wholly false. For Fancy, shooting many a random shaft, Doth sometimes hit the truth; and where Love is Thither doth Fear still haunt him like a shade, Darkening his brightness. âSir,â said the old man, âFive minutes earlier here and ye were lostâ E'en now, scarce saved: there have been yeomen here, Have ransacked all this house, cellar to roof, For search of youâbut for God's providence That led you round to take the wilder way, Sure they had met you, as they skurried hence Ten minutes back. The dust they raised in the house Flies yetâtheir oaths are tingling in my ears. Well, we're well quit of them for this one turn: For the restâhence awayâone twinkling here May hold within it your whole life to lossâ May gar you caught and shortened by the headâ Orâbut where best, you should best knowâfor me, That harm should come to you, 'twere a sore grief: And there is one whose grief were worse for you. Aye, you have guessed me right. 'Tis even sheâ My dear young mistressâwellâif you must meetâ Be it a minute only; there she isâ I left her in the garden even now, By the brook-side: but mark me, 'tis not I Would tell love-talesâYou guessed it first yourself; And whate'er fall, the praise or blame is yours You twoânot mineâwellâbe what may; we're men: Heaven guide it for the best: give me your handâ A happier meeting when we meet againâ And soâGod bless you.â These were earnest words. And stirred the hearer, as sound of rushing shot, The danger past, yet dreadful: but when Hope Showed him the end his love so fondly yearned, The sight which but to see was to be blest, Her presence, and the pressure of her hand: Then was his trouble turned into bright joy, Running afresh. He sped, swift as Love's shaft, Thither, to that untoward lonely spot; And found it, lone still, save her lovely self. âLucy, how happy! thus to find thee hereâ My prayer hath place: And what chance gives, oh, be not so severe, To gainsay its grace. 'Tis but a minute's stay, danger is near, And I must far away. Nay, speak me kind, and smile on me while here, 'Tis but a minute's stay. Yet a small light will gleam thro' a far spaceâ And such a smile Would cheer me thro' all danger and disgrace A weary while.â âOh doubt it notâmost glad am I That thou art safe and free, 'Scaped from each evil enemy, But what were this to me? For thou art fallen off from us, I heard it but this day: And wert thou then so treacherous? And is it as men say? Oh yes, my mother told it me, She told me all she knew; But then these troopers seeking theeâ Say, is it false or true?â âTreacherous and fallen off and false or true! What are these words to me? I who have dared the worst, and will dare through; Lucyâwho told it thee?â âAh thenâabove all trickery I trust one look of thineâ They did thee wrong, and so did I, The misery be mine. And thy good name from that foul blot Is brighter than before; But my lost peace returneth notâ 'Tis gone for evermore. Forgive their fault and my beliefâ Alas! I may not tellâ And yet the tale would soothe my griefâ Farewellâand oh! farewell.â She spoke and kissed his hand, and gliding away Left him in spell-bound gaze. Strange things befal, Ghosts have been seen, and mountebank feats done, And witches proven and burnt: and people have stared As tho' the wide expansion of their eyes Would make the wonder less. So wise is the world. But when since wonderment belonged to it, Did wondrous chance e'er strike on witlessness With such a stunning and astounding stroke As then on Hermann? He had hopedâbut Hopeâ Why prate of her? had hoped and now despaired And his despair was wiser than his hopeâ Man's surest wisdom. There he stood, stock-still, As tho' her touch had frozen him to ice, His blood stiff as his bonesâbut a girl's will Is not God's doom, stedfast, unstriveable; And who is driven amain by its wilfulness Haply he needs but wait the tide's return To waft him back again in graciousness. For earthly Love hath a boy's waywardness, Gaming at high and lowâelse, were all flat, So were he tooâsmooth paths are not for him: To walk belies his wings. Hermann thought not One whit of these sound truths, but he acted them. His scattered wits first gathering, then to the house, As an engineer, after a startling burst, What it might mean. But other wills, meanwhile, Were there at work and counter to his own: And where he would fain go and search it thro' Prevention barred his way. As he strode up, There met him one, forthright, tho' cripple and halt, Yet brisk, the goodman's mother of that homeâ A careful soulâmuch did he owe to her Of reverence, and duly rendered it; But what he owed her of Love, let us e'en hope 'Twas little; else if great, 'twas greatly more Than e'er he paid. Yet 'twas well done of her, Courteously well, to meet her guest half-way: A gracious showâand that rare grace from her And toward him, commended it the moreâ Alas! 'twere well for the world if show would tell: Wages were then earned cheaplyâour beads, pearls, Our bosom vices become virtuous: Good deeds plenty as dirt. Why in Heaven's name, Why hath not Man the trick of Government, To make his paper gold? How wealthy of soul He were! how many million millons then The devil his debtor! yet what needs for pay E'en paper? Lo! our ghostly ministers Quit them in wordsâthey read from out a book And their task's done. Well then, if words will clear The score as well, they clear it better tooâ Better and cheaper by the paper's worth: Wherefore such waste? Look to it, financiers. And make cheap cheaper; save your paper, and pay In words, as do those holy devout men Who've studied the truth most, and must know best. âSir, said that Dame, belike 'tis strange to you To see me thusâstrange and unneighbourly; Sure you must feel it soâbut where need is To meet an old friend with new countenance, 'Tis better at the threshold than the hearth. And Sir, it grieves me much to tell you so, But grief is an ill thing to keep at heart, And I've no secret but may well be said: So, in plain truth, we have been friends awhile; And, if it be your will, friends will we part. Lest else our friendship, as my father 'd say, Poor soul, he's dead and gone, far e'er your time. Lest friendship, rubbing as 'twere thusâcross-wise, And not too smoothly, should soon wear away. 'Tis better so, good Sir, much better soâ Much gainlier, tho' it were the dearest limb, Cut clear away, thou hang but by the skin. 'Twill smart us some, yet off, rather 'n half on. Sir, ye are loremen, both of ye, book-learned, Both you and my good son; and I, please God, Am a plain homely wife: yet such a one May tell a plain taleânay, let me say out, For the least hinder'd is the soonest done. 'Tis not for me you're here, I know it well; But for a dearer sakeâforbear me then Awhileâit burns me till I utter all. Well thenâCount Linsingen hath been with us: And what he might chance say to Lucy, and how She answered, is no gossip's tale for usâ Only thus muchâenough tooâThey're betrothed For man and wifeâNow, Sir, I warrant ye, And ye've more wit than needs to be so told; When once the trinket's bought, the buyer forthwith Takes it from the shop-window and broad gaze, And treasures it away to his heart. Is that Enough? or must I tell ye, our dear good girl, For she is mine too, and but once removed, She is that darling jewel: and once 'gaged, It suits not with good manners and good grace, That other friends than the one, lovers mayhap, Tho' of good likelihood, should haunt her so As when in freerââ âOh my worthy Dame, Why so much more, when so much less would serve. I do beseech thee, give me grace of itâ And tell me, art thou thine own counsellor, Or hath another prompted thee thus far? Her father, haply?â âYes, for I'm not else So meddlesome, to take o'ermuch on me. Tho' truly Reason were that my advice Were asked and had, ere aught were stirr'd in it: Yes, it is they so willed itâand, poor souls, They would fain hide their hand from you, and leave Untold, tho' meaning you right well; lest you Take it amissâSo, what was theirs to do, I've made it mine: there is my say said out: And since my days of school and copybook, And that is threescore since, I've left all use Of flourish at beginning and at end, Writing or speaking; and 'twere now full late To try the trick again. So all I've said, I've said it in all kindliness and faith, And you, Sir, take it home as kindly too: Or if offence must comeâwhyâcome it must; But not of meâWhy, plague of my old head, I had well nigh forgotâseeâhere they are, The letters from them bothâthe kind soft souls; Look if you will; tho' yet there is no word, But I have said it more outspokenly Than they, poor hearts, could bring themselves to write.â As she ended, so she held the letters forth; And Hermann looked on themâhe could no moreâ But looked and looked, till to his ghostly sight They seemed like living things with spectral eyes Gazing upon him. She, in purblind sense, Unwitting, thrust them on his half-clenched hand. He took and opened, but read not at all. Tho' he seemed to readâonly a word or two Seared his dull eyeballs, as 'twere written in fire, And his sight shrank from it. âYes, you are rightâ Right, said I, right? Oh no, 'tis a foul wrong; They know it, who plotted, and shall answer it: But no, God bless them allâher mostâand meâ Sure never man needed His blessing more.â He said, and turned, and slow walked his sad way. While back she hobbled, in hurry of mumbling joy. BOOK IX. Rebellion, Patriotism, Loyalty, Ye are three words, bigger than most beside, Of portly presence, and bold seemliness: Well stuffed and padded: truly ye deserve Your crowd of silly gapers, for ye look So burly 'mong your fellows; matching e'en The great puff bag, the soul of flunkeyhood. For me, I'll none of ye, but blow ye away Scornfully, for the chaff ye areâyet some I ween, will welcome ye most lovingly, Being so great of bulk, and filling well Their blockhead's emptinessâalbeit that bulk Is but a bladder, swollen of fond conceit, The biggest then, when readiest to burst. I wonder what so windy addled a brain Could have begotten yeâyet I know notâ Looking upon ye nearer, I stand in pauseâ A pause of earnest doubt. Oh pardon me! The fault is all my ownâI see it nowâ And see ye clear of it. I did ye wrong: Forgive me, for my true confession's sake. Yes, truly, I disgraced your dignity, Unfairly scoffing, unfitly likening ye. Ye are no roky bladders, nor foul fluffâ Noânor yet words alone, but a live thing. Of shifting life; one off and the next on: A changeful shape, a threefold unityâ Shortly, all three, ye are of larval kind: A single substance, but with several forms; One while a grubâlies still, stirring no jot: And gives no inkling of life, tho' fire should burn, Or water drown it, or pins prick it through; But just so much as this, to shrink from the hand That worries it, and shudder a wee bit. Ah! then indeed, 'tis a praiseworthy grub: Then is its grubbish nature glorified Within a letter of a royal name; Men cry it up and call it loyalty. Blunderers as they are: for loyalty Means love to Law; to right; not to the King; He may be log or stork: that were fool's faith: Howe'er, our grub is now the throne's foot-stool; And kingly pride upon its patience treads; For 'tis a neutral; has no soul of self; A passive noodledom between two lives. It was not always so. Once swiftly it stirred Its twenty feet, living at large, at will, And feeding on its foes, their fields and fruits; Therefore earth's rulers sorely hated it; They called it lawlessness, rebellion, To look to its own likings, not man's law; And cursed it for its free self-helpfulness, But, for it wanted strength, and crawled aground, Having no wings to fly, so 't was soon crushed: For their foes had but to set foot on them. Thus not unrightfully did men stamp out Rebellion; who fails there is in deadly fault: Must winâfor that's his only warrantâelse die, Haply a noble deathâmust die, howe'er. His Truth may save his Conscience, not his life: No! 'tis success alone is currency. So fared our rebel caterpillar; died Or dwindled to a grubâa heartless dull Thing, prisoned in its murky self-spun maze, Helpless and hopeless. There are two of them, Being yet but one. The lawless rebel worm, And the loyal grub: the third is yet behind. Holding a kindred nature with these two, But a strange name. For his life, be none so bold To tell it, but the truest man of the world, Lest he be deemed a liar: 'tis no life, But a miracle; for Nature at his birth, Frolicsome, flung her wonted framework by, And played the fairy. Thus it wasâour grub, After long durance dull, bethought him at last, That patience of all evil for evil's sake, And not for any good should come of it, Is but a loutish wisdom; wise enough For Man, but for the grub too grovelling. âTherefore behoves me to be hence alargeâ But how, and to what hope? aye, there's the knot. For I remember while I was a worm, That my free life was but a straw 'mid fires, And hundred times I was about to die Such hobnail death as my kin-fellows died, And why? for, being weak, they went abroad, A silly folk. Therefore, ere I win out From this constraint, first will I get me wings To fly withal. So counsell'd and so doneâ He got him wings, and then wrought his way forth, Wise as Wisdom herself from her sire's head, Like her too, weaponed well 'gainst dangers abroad, A wilful flashing whizzing dragon fly, Lived as he liked: no man could master him.â âThe world is mineâearth, air, water!â He bragged Truly, and flew his own free flight, and as He flew, so all eyes gazed in wonderment; Yes, he, the worm of that same kind as men When they would crush it, call Rebellion; And when they have coerced it to a grub, Name it anew nought else butâLoyalty. Now, for the same ends issuing, only in pomp And power instead of crawling feebleness; Wending his way, whithersoe'er he will, Oh, then his power doth make him patriot. Rebellion, Patriotism, Loyalty; Ye're larval masks, hiding beneath three names, Man's one self-nature. They who cry ye, cry But a vain noiseâshould speak their silly souls Into a cheap-jack's trumpetâblowing a full Blast, no nice differenceâ'twill mean as much And sound yet louder. Nay, but Fame's own trump Whereby the Despot blows himself abroad, What is it but a cheap-jack'sâonly yet Viler? a penny paper trumpet, of foul Rotten rags: but, thou Despot, why dost need Either? thou rid'st an ass. Patienceâwho brays Tho' mire-drudged, sorely galled, o'erladen, half dead, In pride of his brass trappingsâthine, not his. So let him bray thy fame, thy glory. Yes that Is thy true trumpeter. Of these big names Hermann was each, and all, and none of them. Rebel or Patriot, as Fancy's glass Coloured him. Loyal, but for his own sake Not for his rulersâfirst, let true Law rule, Then Loyalty is truth. Are men but sheep For wolf and tiger? No, but Manhood's worst Danger is not the rebel but the slave Spirit; look Europe round, see how brute hosts Wherever despots sway, trample and grind The country. Then behold each free-folk. Swiss, Belgian, Dutch, Dane, and Norse, all else that are free. Their Freedom is their welfare: look and blush Thou coward cur, still cringing 'neath the lash, Rather than rise for God's right and thy own Against thy whipster. âAh, but he's a Kingâ Emperorâwe're but men.â Men! say ye so? Curs, carrion, swine. Who treads ye into mire Fouls itâwellâwords are waste. Dark was that night And wild the way that Hermann went thro' it; But wilder yet his own bewilderment, Darker his thoughts: cold, cheerless, comfortless, As when the wintry swain, belated and chill, Finding the warm bright blaze that should have been, Dull ashes, feels self-shrunk to a pin's-head. As he too, with his fire, if alike dead, Were happier ended. He had steeled himself, Had Hermann, to a pure high quality; But yet that vaporous breath blown on his steel Clouded it longer time than his purity Gave promise. 'Tis not matter alone, but mind Also, must gravitate unto the mass: For soar however loftily it may, Yet is a check behind to draw it back To the low level and the centre of all. True, he had offered himself freely up To help his countryâbut that gift he gave More heartily, for her, the Priestess' sake Who served the altar: for her smile he hoped, Fair hope: which else, without it, was nought left But the outflash of the fire, and slayer, and axe, Most terrible; but no, 'twas only a cloud That chills but craven heartsâkeeps off the sun Without, not the in-glow. âDastards, weak thoughts, Thus I forswear ye; so he shouted out Fierce, as he felt the quickening influence, And waved his staff on high. Ye're but the thin Mist that I scatter; likelier to hope, And manlier, much more: 'tis a strong ground This granite, and yet stronger this my cause: But thou my Faith, dost stumble and waver now, Ere thou are fairly forth? noâbut straight on Boldly, for sooner shall these mountains quail Than thy religious rock of righteousness Shall slip from under thee:â thus as he spoke, His spirit rose e'en to the height of his speech; Aye, and above it: words are wondrous things: Begotten of thoughts they beget other thoughts And wordsâlike lightningâflashing into works. And so did Hermann don the shield of Faith Against the brunt of doom: 'twas wisely done, For Doubt is dangerâbetter sleep in the hearth Chair, than out fearfully to fight the storm, Tho' for a kingly venture. He strode on, As if a giant's strength were in each stride, Upright and bold: whither to steer his way, While yet his spirit's light was in eclipse, He knew not, knowledge waits on willâbut now He felt his destiny drawn out forthright So fast and strong, as he could walk on it Unswervingly, no sidelong look or thought, But only on. First, to his shepherd friend: In the like faith as who commits his hand To his own glove; for he knew the man of old, Truthful and simple-minded as his trade. Thither he went: and as he went, the day Was westering downward: while the unwieldy dull Self-thwarting earth, that brooks not the full light But, as Truth gains on him, so turns himself Wilful, to darkness on the other side Away: slowly and blindly upheaved his bulk Darkening with its shadow all our day. And the heather that erewhile shone in the sun Goldenly, now put off its gaudiness, Disrobed by darkness; changing its gay cloak To russet and again to gloomier yet In sad gradationâas that gloom grew on, Hermann stopp'd short to listen and look out; But nothing could he see, save the huge hills In distance dimly swelling 'gainst the sky; Or an owl with white wings deepening the night, As slowly it sailed in large and larger wheel. He looked againânought elseâlisten'd and heard Nothing save his own breath: then, while without All was shut against sense, he looked within; And there his thoughts burnt up so blazingly, They were good cheer and light and warmth to him. So buoyant, they upraised him above earth, Treading, not feeling it. He gave them free Opening to flow, and thus did they flow on. âLucy, once I was thy lover: Thou wert mine, as thou didst say; Now those sunny days are over, Coldly now thou turn'st away. Be it soâfor so thou provest Faithless kind in faithless vow: Woman-like thou liv'st and lovest: I must prove my manhood now. Lucy now I'm but thy brother. Manhood asks no selfish meed: Now my spirit is none other But the Patriot's indeed. Fool I wasâfar gone in madness Thus to sow the shifting sand: Now I reap my seed in sadness: A lone outcast here I stand. Yet 'tis wellâfor surely never With a soul so rent in twain Had I reached my high endeavour. Half a wish is wholly vain. I am sworn to o'erthrow the tower Of old majesty and might, To uprear the people's powerâ Is that labour all too light? Is it but a toy of pleasure? And must Love come flaunting in, As on some fond maiden's leisure, Balking all that I begin? NoâI dreamed, and in my dreaming Saw familiar lovely things Of heart-soothing, home-like seeming, Bright fireside imaginings. Now I wakeâthe dream's past o'er meâ Wafted wizard-like away: And I see the truth before me, Marshalled in war's stern array. Boyish love thou art a stranger, Girlish troth thou art belied. I must marry me with Danger: Tell me, wilt thou be my bride?â âNay, I know not,âWilt thou woo me, Thou must sue with thy good sword; Only he who can subdue me, Will I take him for my lord.â âBe it soâthou glorious creature! There is lightning in thine eye; Thou art strong and fierce of feature Yet I front thee fearlessly. To my sword thou shalt surrender Thy stern beauty for a bride: High renown and stately splendour Shall spring to me from thy side. Life and fortune, all I cherish, Thus I fling them 'mong my foesâ To the rescueâor they perishâ Help me Heaven, here we close.â He spake; and as the word prompted the deed He launched his staff forward, a strong arm's launch, Among the heather. Even and straight it sped, Making small stir in the air, but piercing deep As with a point of steel in the hard ground; Quivering there as doth a bristling beast His teeth clenched in his game. Hermann came up Following his aim. âFaith 'tis a goodly throw, And shews a goodly strength. If I drive home The intent whereon my soul is now astrain But half so manly, then may I strike through The heart of foemanship, ere head can warn Or arm can ward its danger.â Fair was the hint, And glad the man that 'twas vouchsafed to him. âOh, Lord may my hope's speed be straight as this, As straight, and steady, and strong. I ask no more, And no more needs.â By this the sky and air Were an ocean darkness of unfathomed depth. Hardly o'er a steep hill he clamber'd up, Blindly to peer below. There stood the hut; The shepherd's lonely home, unseen itself, But by the token of unsteady light Flickering within. There on the height he staid, Resting upon a hillock, to forecast What he must soon propose. He sate, his head Pillowed upon his hand, deep sunk in thought: A short half-hour. Then up again and on; But as he started forth there shone a light Sudden amid the gloomâwhat might it be? Fancy or lonely fear might deem it a lamp Of prowling foes, rounding most warily Their nightly searchâbut a few steps toward it, He sawââpoor worm, thy glow is starlike bright, And yet who heeds it? I and thou, we're mates, For I too bear a light, and I trust well It is both true and holy as thine is: And I go forth to shine in the dark world: Yet haply will the world heed me no more Than it doth theeânay but 'twill shiver me To atoms, for the searching light I bring 'Mong its malignant vapours. Look up thereâ Look to yon starry host shining above. What thinkest? Shine they not brighter than thou? Yet none regards themâa lost lightâI tooâ 'Twere well I should take home the lesson I teachâ For hath not God himself come down on earth? A grace much greater truly than that star Yonder, that one, the mightiest of them all, Should stoop from Heaven to that lowly hut And take the rushlight's turn. Yes, they scorned Himâ They smote Him, and they slew Him and what then? Why truly then there is much likelihood That they should hearken me. Well, as they will, If they requite me evil for my good, Thenâquicker death is sooner happiness; So be itâfor till then strife, danger, and hate Bestorm me, till the bloody atoning end. Welcomeâfor death makes dearthâso patriot truth Reaps glory. Thanks to thee, good glow-fellow, For these good thoughts.â He said, and he was there: There at the door; yet staid awhile, his hand Upon the latch; for boisterous uproar Of many tongues was hurtling from within: It seemed guests were enow by that fireside, Needed no stranger more. âWhat were they all? To keep wassail so late, carousing o'er His cups was not of old the shepherd's wont, Nor likely now. What if the Philistines Were ambushed there awaiting who should come Within their mischief? Nay, the deadly pool Is noiseless. Howe'er, doom is doom; 'tis I 'Gainst Dangerâtruly, a deep game we play, And desperateâI stake my life 'gainst Hope And Honour: would I winâmust dare and do Outrightânor shrink from th' upshot, happen howe'er, Friends or foes, I confront them.â As he spoke He did. That door creaked on its crazy hingeâ He stood within. Our fears are mostly clouds. There were his own trust-fellows, brethren, friends, Bound to him, whether holy or world-ties, But all fast bound. Ere he could lift his hat They hailed him, hopeless seen, with such a shout Joyful, such sudden shout of eager joy, As blew the cobwebs from the black roof-beams A witch-like network. Good, tho' seldom, it is, In this cold icy clime, where manners live Alone, having outthrust the natural man, To see the spirit glow, and the heart's blood Gush to the forehead; e'en as then their hands Met hastily, but parted not so soon, From their warm grasp. âMy friends, I like ye well, Ye and your greetingâa glad issue it bodes; But sit ye down, and I will tell ye all, Both hear and tell.â âNay, be thou seated first, Said the good shepherd's wife, homely and kind, For sure thou hast most need: and art thou clear, Clear o' those lion clawsâand our gloom turned To glad surprise? much I misdoubted thee, And fretted sore, and ever in and out, To look o'er the hill side, and then to search For crumbs of comfort in the blessed book. For a poor silly woman that I am, Fearing where no fear wasâAh, Sir, good Sir, The best of us are faulterers in the Faith, Sad falterersâshame and sin both! to set Man's fear above God's faith: praised be His name. But, Sir, thou'rt come. Heaven love thee evermore, Dear as we do and bless and cherish thee, Sure as the blessing thou hast brought us all. But come, sit there, by the fire. We are poor folk; Yet what we canâsuch store as God hath sent, Bacon and bread, and eggs, aye, and drink tooâ Thou art no hireling, thou, yet well hast earned A better hire than any we can give. A blessing on thy heart, it makes me glad As I were a young girl, to see thee again, Glad of thee safe, as late of thy fear sad. There so, 'tis well.â Hermann sate down and ate, Till he was comforted with meat and drink; Then they took turn, asking and answering; Matter enoughâthe day and its fresh deeds, And what should come of themâhow each had 'scaped That rough encounter, and all other spite Of the Evil One, by guidance of the Lord: Surely a special grace. Then what was next To fear, what earnest likely of their hope: Eager each Conscience to communicate How now for furtherance. âSir,â said one man, A sallow blear-eyed cobbler from the town; âMuch have I wrestled with these thoughts, few more; And what ye've undertaken, I like it well, In main: and for its sake I'll on as far, As any here will dare to follow me. But, Sir, in this your forecast there's one flaw, Frights me to thinkâa gap Sirâyawning wide As the jaws of Hell. What of the Papists, Sir? Ayeâwhat think ye of them? for to my mind 'Tis a clear truth, and I'm as sure of it As tho' God's own angel had told it me, 'Tis they have brought the curse into this land, Plagu'ing it with their damned idolatry. And 'till we fling them from our bosom forth, Stone them, or burn, or slay them with the sword, That curse will cleave to us. Sir, ye well know, Last season was a dearth within the land, A murrain 'mong the flocksâall things at odds; And business slack and handicraft heart-sick; Why Sir, I sate a week, my hands thus like, Across my bosom, for sheer lack of work, And fire to keep them warm: no other pay, Nor hope, nor pastime, but to chew our ills And the black cause of them. Why should this be But for a token of wrath? and why such wrath But for that idol Sin? These things were not In our forefathers' time; or only then When in such wise they sinned as we do now And suffered all the same. Therefore we're curs'd With fire, and tithes, and evil government; With fornication and all deadly sin; With drought for rain, and rain when drought were need, Drowning the harvest. 'Tis clear truth, all this, Written outright as any printed book, That he who runs may read it. Therefore, Sir, To outdo this deep damnation from the land, I bid ye in God's name not onlyââ âOh, yes,â Herman replied, âI know what ye would say And have: and there are other godly men Think e'en as thou, and yet haply 'twere bestââ âAye true, it were much best to bide on it,â Said an old clownish toper, sharp and shrill, âEre we do aught. Heaven is a far way off, And who shall say which is most near to it? Each thinks his own the gainer pathâfor me I never spoke nor did them any good Those Papistsâyet my corn rotted no less Than theirs, who, as folks say, worship the Priest Instead of Godâbut there's a something, Sir, Hampers us nearer homeâthe curs'd Law-suit About our common-right: and many say, They see not why, if that same mischief needs Must hold, and be the mischief that it is, They see not in that case why they should stir To stake both limb and life. Now, Sir, mayhap, You may see good to satisfy us all, (For truly we are many of that mind) That we shall have and hold the land for our own: Common and close e'en as Hess promised us: And who would hinder us, to make quick end, Gar hang him up straightwayâno Law-leave asked, But the thing done; that were both wisdom and right Where now is neither.â âThis,â Hermann replied, âIs not for me to rule, but for the main Meetingâhowever, trust me, whatsoe'er Is reason, shall be law; only forbear Some little of full right; and mark God's word. The land shall not be sold, for it is mine: And ye are strangers there and sojourners. And mark this too-first must we free the landâ Else is our Freedom hopeless: but take heedâ Lest, when ye would but clear ashes and dust For thoro' draft, ye rake the whole fire out, Reckless, as wrath is wontâbe heedful then.â âSir, by your leave,â so said a sturdy hind Slow risingââmay I be so boldâa word About a cow of mine that my neighbour Helst, Down in the hollow, hath wronged meâbut the Law They say, will bear him thro'. Now, I've heard talk That ye're about it, bettering the Law, And that's bad need. Sir, I'm a Gospeller,â I've followed you, since my old mother ailed, And sent me in her room, lest prayer should fail Out of the house. Sir, you would glad her heart, I warrant her, poor soul, to stand our friend? And mine no less. I'd follow ye, be sure, Thro' fire and water.â Hermann heard and smiled, Then turned to a fresh call. âBut Sir, the Jews,â 'Twas a young man that spake, knightly of blood, Courtly of bearing, fair to look upon, But steeped in riot, as his drunken eye, And luscious lips, and thick voice witnessed him. âPapist or Puritan who cares one curse? What boots all else if the Jews must suck our blood Henceforth as heretofore? They've screwed me back Hundreds for every score they doled me out. They've swindled me, aye, plucked me bare as a board. Meâthousands too beside me. Now why keep Such vermin on God's earth? why let them live? Can any tell me whyâverminânought elseâ That foully overrun, tease, plague, and drain Us Christiansâour whole body, with more zest Plundering us from spiteful hate of us. Yet we forbear themâwhy? who ever heard Of any good a Jew ere did till he died? Who ever saw a stroke of work by them? Or a kind deed on any Christian. Ah, no! Their life is but one smouchy, sneaking lie. Let their law try themâusury is deathâ So Mosesâto the old Jewâand why not These later too? there I'm true Jew myself. Then scourge them, stone them, slay them, or if that Seem harsh to mawkish mindsâthen drive them out, And ridââ âAye rid thee from them,â Hermann said, âThat sures thy willâfor not to deal with them Is death to them: but mindâthey walk right well In their own way, live in true brotherhoodâ Let us likewise, we Christians, learn of them That gracious lessonâthen, if we can, scorn Our teachers: but till thenââ Ere he could end, Uprose another speakerâup he sprang, A man broad and huge-boned, and big of limb, But most ungainly; in his sprawling gait Belying his frame's burly likelihood. His face, 'twas heavy-jowled, black-brow'd, mud-hued, As tho' life blood had never healthen'd it. No more than featured clayâa dull damp mask, No seeming soul: self-gather'd, there he sate Like to a man o'erwhelmed with his own weight, Stifled and sunk in his fleshâfor all his life Seemed run into his eyes wild fiery lightâ Two wondrous bright lamps, flaring fitfully Thro' the night fog, hither and thither whirled By the spirit's wind within him. His coat hung Loose on his back, as a gipsy mother's brat, In uncouth heap: dishevelled bushy hair Misshaping his huge head and tangling o'er His forehead's square bold breadth. Such was the man, Christopher Ernst: he had besought awhile To be a preacher in the brotherhood: And for his gifts, they fell not short, some said They overreached that height: and many there Did deem his glowing speech inspired of God. But, for he looked but to his own inlight, Nor made his reason of the worldly rule, Therefore, the more denied him what he asked, Counting him mad. Madness! that name belongs Likeliest to them, who take so crooked a stick As the world's custom for their canon of right And judge therebyâbut the wise man were oft Wiser, to hide his deep wisdom away 'Neath shallow worldly wit: so let him do, Else will men deem him a fool. âBrethren and friends,â So spoke the stern enthusiast, glowering round Slowly, a wild and visionary glare: âFor so I call and cherish ye, tho' some Answer with evil my good will; we've heard Much, a great heap of little things, more meet For alehouse talk than for our mighty aim, Cows, commons, and benighted Romanists. All idle, yea, my friends, all idle alike, And green as the sick fancy of a girl. I nill 'emânill 'em wholly, whisk 'em away. And is it for such shallow silliness We're bound, and sworn never to loose our bond, Until the full achievement give us leave? Is't not as easy to say all as the half? Why, if we stake our lives, why should we not Make peril glorious with its high prize? Aye, why indeed? Have ye not the more strength And the better right? are ye not millions? And they, your gainstmen what are they? Some few Stragglers, some fopling idlers here and there, Of no account, or only of so much To make your bulk of body seem more big By their thin show. What! do ye know your wills? Then what ye will, 'tis ready to your hand, Take it, make much of it, and thrive by it: And take it all. Nor leave no corner or hole, Whence the old spider may 'gin spread again His cunning usurpation. Are ye men? Aye, surely: why then fear a scold's foul words? No, what the lawyer and priest, the thieves, 'twixt whom Sitting in state this people is crucified, Themselves best due; what they for their own ends Have so perplexed that none may loose the knot; Cut thro' such question with the edge o' sword Making all sheer: down with themâdown in the dust There leave them: as these gin-drops, last of my cup, That I fling there, foul spirits, down in the ash, To hiss their life out; but are ye such dolts To spend your eager spirit and flower of prime Idly puzzling to make atonement there Where God and Truth have both made severance 'Twixt Law and Reason? patch not with new cloth The rotten coatâsow not 'mong thornsâbut since 'Twas Satan doomed, for Man's original sin, His body, soul, ownership, commonweal, To leech-craft, priest-craft, law-craft, office-craft, Which office means obstruction, truly named, Now let Christ's grace free us from Satan's law. But, my friends, hearken meâdreams I've oft dreamt, And visions I've beholden, haply true, But this, the latest trance vouchsafed to me Is truth itself. An angel yesternight Visited me, an angel of the Lord. Nay, start not, 'twas indeed, a glory of Heaven. I knew it surely, not by my eyesight, But by my soul's own feeling. Thus it was:â My wife and little ones were all a-bed, And I left there to brood upon my thoughts, Dim as the dying embers. Suddenly There shone a vehement light thro' all the room, As tho' a thousand suns were lit at once, So bright, it outdid all beside: I looked, But my sight failed me, and a-blind I staredâ Yet was I conscious of a presence there Spirit-like, strange, unearthly, a soul-sight No tongue can tell. Past wonder there I stood Astounded, and this truth burst forth on me, No sound, nor breath-born utterance of words, But the spirit's self, âI come to thee from God, He 'th chosen thee to be His voice to man. Then speak thou thus to those with whom thou'rt leagued, As God speaketh to thee. They who rule now He suffered them long time, but hence no more, Their cup is fullâmust drink its lowest dregs There was a time for Grace, they let it go; For Mercy, and they took no heed of it; Now is the hour of wrath. Go, from their height Abate themâsternly, not bloodthirstily. For they are an abhorrence in my sight For the evil they have done; and once o'erthrown So leave themâlift no earthly lordship up; For God alone is Lord; man's privilege Is but a root of all perversity. Outdo it, root, stem, branch: lest slackening Ye draw their vengeance down on your own heads. Go forth; I've saidâfulfil thou thoro'ly. I heard no moreâfor lo! sudden again A horror of deep darkness fell on me. Brethren, these wordsâthis biddingâ'tis the Lord. That thunder's utterance fain would I seal up Deep in my soul, but 'tis forbidden me. They've starved us, have these men, of half our bread, For two loaves, a scant oneâthey've made our Church A den of thieves and hirelings, fouler far; And Law, a two-edged blade, no handle or hold, Wounding his hand, whoe'er asks help from it, Worse than his wrong: therefore I call on ye Go, gripe those scoundrel throats to upgorge our spoil Tho' it come with their hearts' blood. Slaughter whoe'er Withstands yeâmake clear workâand of their bones Rear up a pile high as the Pyramids, For a sign and wonder.â He ended, and sate down. The big sweat glistening on his brow like steam On the cauldron's side when water seethes within. He was so fervid: all tongues after him Were hushed, as by a trumpet blastânone spake. Their marvel was too much; at last one rose Forth from the brooding silence, a spare man: So spare, it seemed that thought and lore had been His only diet: one whom his shrewd look, Piercing and keen, smiling half scornfully, Where others looked most gravely, and amid Reasonings, preachings, prayers, scorn-smiling still, Bespoke him truly what he was, ere yet His words declared what he would seem to be. Bespoke him one who viewed the world as a stage, Where fools go masked; and who would pick a purse Must mask him also for a seeming fool, And thence, a gainful knaveâthe world a stage, And all that's played upon it a rank lie, Where silly folks go feel, wonder, and weep, While wiser men but whisper 'mong themselves âWell acted:â and where others reverently Believe, more reverently would he scorn, As a zany gaping on his conjuror, Wearing a deferential wonderment To mask contempt. He was a gatherer Of taxes, and of late he had been drawn Into sore question to clear up his count, Hence his sharp spite. âSir, that we're Patriots, All worthy men and true, thinking no thought, But for our country's good, that is most sure, For we have said it, who best know ourselves: And as we only are the sterling coin, So they, the other sidesmen, are but trash, Sheer ruffians, cads and duffers. Well, what then? Be it so: ourselves good goldâthey slag and dross; What then? ah, truly! if they'll yield us all For this pure Truth that we profess, t'were well: But if we must come out to trial of blows, Then must the stronger o'ermatch the godlier. My friends, if we be better men than they Our worth may be rewardedâbut not now. Must die and rot ere trial; happy indeed That hope, which sees so far and clear in the dark. But here, just now, 'tis the big muster I want, And skill and strength: for after all, they, too, Are someâwellâsay ye so, I trust it too, We've ludship against lordship: sticks and stones 'Gainst shotâa thousand bludgeons 'gainst one sword. Well then, with but one head to a hundred hands, Those odds, however clownish, are enough: And so much joy to us for our good cause And better strength. 'Tis there I hold with you: For I belong not to the brotherhoodâ I stand outside, and am too mild a man To blend me with their brotherly bickerings. But, Sir, we're Patriots, and all that's wise And good and true is uttered in that word: Else, where it otherwise, much that I've heard Seemed a moon-stricken dream. Lands some would have In commonâaye, but, friends, a common, at best Is sorry pastureâscrambling strife wastes all. Far better each man's earnings for himself, How scant soe'erâyet, we're much wronged. The priest, Landlord, and placeman, and lawyer, grieve us sore, And sorely that same grievance shall they rue, If we work out our will. To the storm-god For his first victims the black cattle; and I've A sauce so highly seasoned, every tongue Shall cry âenough.â 'Tis a just judgment, Sir, They starved us then and they shall feed us nowâ And it shall be, as they've no other means, With their own fleshâaye, Sir, we'll slay them first, And eat them afterâah, 'twere a rich treat, To make the parson of to-morrow's dish, Say grace o'er the roast placeman of to-day, And the squire tooâthey fed on the land's fat, Must render it in kind; and they, the plague Of earth, those idolist cursed Romanists, 'Tis they, as being in that skill well seen Shall light the fire: light it, and when 'tis lit, Flung in themselves for fuel. This ye see Is the strong man's riddle, out of the eater meat, Thus solved: a good solutionâbut too mild. So for the will: now for the way: and first, I would forewarn ye, ere ye flay this bear, To master himâfor he hath claws and teethâ And bearhood tooâunlike meekly to stand And let ye pluck them out. Therefore be warnedâ And when your enemy is down in the dust And ye with weapon'd hands stride over him, 'Twill then be time for vengeance, if that be Your wisdom. Friends, mistake not, that I thwart Your aimsâAh no! I'm wronged, and hope redress By your meansâgo forth and thriveâonly I think Your zeal may chance to be a quality Fiercer than wiser, burning but for light To your foes, and to your own bewilderment. Beware thenâkeep your fire for the coming fight, For counsel needs cool headsâno mobâno many Headedânay, wince notâhearken but the truth. For universal suffrage is Bedlam loose. A foul sewer-flood, worse than the sin-flood was. Allman is goodman, while he keeps to his work, Hodman or carman, seaman, ploughman, aught elseâ Only not statesmanâno good Allmanânoâ Beware that craftâit belongs not to thee, But to thy bettersâthou'st no mind for it, Thou'rt but a bodyâone that keeps to itself Its best, its blood, life, sense, warmth; keeps 'em all Withinâwhat it gives out we welcome notâ Nayâshut out eyes and hold our nose from it. Such voidance means avoidanceâto my sense. Indeed good Allman, not to flatter thee, Thou art a body, brute, not politic, And all its utterance is but excrement. Ayeâe'en its most sweet breath of suffrageâe'en that, For thou'st no mind. Behoves thee a head, and Iâ My friendsâI've framed so shrewd a plan, will sure Carry us thro', if ye'll be ruled by me; And trust me wholly. What then! ye will not! Not meâsome likelier headâye must go far To find himâwell, keep coolâI'll wait awhile Your wiser mood. Ye'll need meâI need not you.â 'Mid much outcry of angry gainsayers, Zimmermann ended. Hermann hastily Uprising, thus began, for wishful he was To stop that overflowing waste of words, Where else had seemed no end. âBrethren, much free Outspoken Truth I've listened, and heard much Well worth the listeners while; righteous complaint And bold determination to redress Whate'er is wronged. And if therein were aught Fiercer than lukewarm statesmanship may like, Such utterance is but excess of zeal, And so to exceed, I hold ye worthier praise Than blameâfor man is feeling, spirit and blood Will resent wrong: but there's a soul of strife And selfish shrewd detraction, worthier far Of blame than praise. Treason within our camp! Beware, 'twere death. What ye've dared hitherto, Next to your own free spirit and God's will 'Tis partly I have kindled ye thereto: Blowing with forward breath upon your fire Which self-reserve had damply stifled else, Not to surmount its smoke: and now, once up, Be it good or bad, I who have spirited Must answer it. So, when I heard e'en now My purposes upbraided, my truth blamed, Eager I felt to answer in account For what I counselled: specially, what late Ye agreed me, but some now gainsay; to enlarge This land from many shreds of ownership To one main folkstead, as did Israel's God; Instead of severalty, envy and strife, New robbery worse than the old. Nor would I blout All lights of old experience, nor efface Time's landmarks, mindmarks if ye will, deep stamped With reverence, steep'd in feeling. No, the old Castle, tho' shattered, the old abbey, old church, Old oak, old Stemhouse of old family Renowned, these would I cherishâfor some stay For garish life to pause and look upon. Lest this hot reckless world be all in all. For 'tis refreshful, from our dust of noon With spiteful strife whirling and blinding us, To stand awhile 'neath the still cooling shade Of ages. Such communion with the worth, Tho' time-worn, of time-tried, time-honoured Eld O'erawes our fleeting upstart pride; can thence Measure its present littleness against The huge dark lengthening shadows of the past. So Reverence grows, deepening and stablishing Character, first in the man, thence in the State. Then to this Reverence, our main safeguard 'Gainst rashness of folk-rule, must we train minds, From child and boy to man. Nature for this Hath helped us: hear the bard's high utterance. âHail, usages of pristine mould And ye who guard them, mountains old.â We, too, must help her. Therefore what is deep Rooted among us in ground, time or heart, That would I not upstir it needlesslyâ Although its branching shade should overspread The ploughman: e'en to him a score lone oaks Far scattered, are more comfort than land's loss. Take ye that truth to mind, and in it uphold As landholders your time-tried landowners; With little loss in wealthâmuch gain in worthâ If they uphold their own state worthilyâ But that's a task for council. Much ill-will I've weathered, for this standard's sake, so main. Nor from much worse, at need, shall I shrink back: These things, and many more, fully I meant, But others in their forward patriot fire, A mood most praiseworthy, where not o'erwild, (And much I hope they'll show it elsewhere too) Forespoke meâmany thanksâfor what one said Another did gainsay: each answering each, And left me to look on and listenâenow Of words already have been here bestowed; And this high tower, were building heavenward, Seems like that Babel from confusion of tongues. So, since 'twere shame to o'erload your weariness, For all my speech I'll tell you a short tale. Listen it, if you will:â Awhile ago, But when and where behoves me not to say, There was a river sweeping proudly forth From its highlands to the sea: so noble a stream, As nothing less than the great ocean Were worthy outlet for such stately life. And, as beseemed that State, many there were, Greater or less, rivers and brooks, and rills Did pay it tribute: bringing in their wealth, Pouring forth all their channels could contain But to supply its profuse kingly pride. And as of old tradition they were wont, E'en so they did awhileâtill some began, Grumbling their surly ground-swell. âWhat means this? Strange fools are weâwhy should we lose ourselves But for his gainâand he our sovereign, Who flows but from our flow, lives by our life, What doth he for it? how requite our love And purblind loyalty? Why, not at all. Oh noâfor he's the head, and we the tail, Born but to follow himâand so we do, Blindly, as all too weak to hold our way Unless behind himâso he careers round For statelier self-show, and we poor things Obsequious after himâbut Time is a true Teacherâthat head may hence be its own tailâ We'll find a shorter way.â So said, so done. They did forsay their faith, shifted their aim, Gnawed them new channels, and forth venturously Each as a lonely pilgrim, so to fare As he might chance to find; but what they found Erelong, in the wild error of their way, Much better had they miss'd. Soon is strife sown And severance madeâbut severance bears no fruit. Luck is not lonelyâFreedom from the bond Of union is but dreary helplessness. Each left his olden way for a straighter one, But found, for the free blessings they were wont, Sore cursesâall cross and untowardly. Dykes cut in the alarm and dams thrown up Against themâworse than all, what seemed forthright, Nature had barred it. Hills, rivers, and bogs 'Twixt them and their fond fancyâthe more toil And the less hope. Till at the last, what each Had chew'd awhile, but felt it stick in his throat, They took to their proud stomach: rendering Such suit and service as they gave of yore, With lowly prayer to be ta'en back in grace Where late they left in scorn: and so again Filling one channel by their confluence, And called one name, they did forget themselves To amity and unity once more: Making a mighty flood of their blent power, Which else were impotentâshaping their course In such large round as they might best take in Whoe'er would with them; and so, not straight indeed, But surely, speeding onward to their end With hourly augmentation. This, my friends, Tho' seeming fable is a very truth: And in their wisdom may ye see your own, Thither to aim, where is attainable. Thus only can we thro'; for bond is none Of surety, without vantage on each side To make the tie. Who would grasp all, must lose All he would graspâall that, and himself too; A silly lossâsilly as the dragon's tail Would lead head, body, and all. Do nothing then Selfishly: each self-wish must ye forego To swell the main: nor be so frowardly Rather to give up all to your worst foes Than a little to your friendsâfirst make your joint Hawl, and be sure of itâ'twill then be time How best to sort your fish.â He ceased, and they Backed him with one strong shout, that swayed the smoke Aback from the huge chimney. â'Twas well said, And should be done. Let each think by himself, And work with all.â So they resolved, and who Could teach them better, he were wise indeedâ Wiser to rest on itâfor Wisdom knows Nothing so hateful as the unwholesome wit Of sneering, bitter wranglers. Their talk done, Good cheer and laughter followed thro' the night, And merry songs, and the brown earthen jug Crested with foamâthen was each rugged chair Drawn round the fire in friendlier fellowship And livelier. While thus they caroused there Hermann, much overstrained, and quite toil'd down, Wished them, with one glass more, their hope fulfilled, And staggered to his restâsuch sorry lair As a straw-shed affordedâyet to him Made happy by the holy spirit of Love Which to Christ's faith holds the like function As soul to body. In that same he breathed And lived and wroughtâand it shed over him There as he slept a holy, balmy joy, Angelic calm: 'stead of those wildering dreams Rising from out those other bigot brains In sullen fumes, checkered with raging flames. BOOK X. Religion, they who deem thee God's own grace Hallowing Man to holy happiness, Deem thee aright: thou art indeed no less. For like the earth he lives on, so Man's life Needs both co-active and expansive power, To keep due course. Law, to curb Nature's lust, Lest it break loose in wild self-will; and Love To speed his soul thro' its wide godly range Of grace: for Love is godliness, and thou'rt The channel that holds, guides and speeds his spirit, Else stagnant; but when so straightened, forthright Streamingâyet some reckon thy heavenly worth Alone, and wholly miss thy earthly one; As God's word only, not His work, were thine. But art thou then unfit for worldly wont Since hallowed above self? Should holiness Live coldly aloof? That is worse heresy Than ever fed the flames: it cuts thy root, That thou must die and be a barren stock, Or like a taper o'er the shrouded monk Burn but to waste. Nay, but 'tis false, as sure As being true, it were a deadly truth, For what are Prayer, and Fast, and godly Faith, But several functions to one end; Man's good? Fulfilled, not by themselves, but by the spirit Born of them, the self-spending will for work. For the Creator's glory is not His own Praise, but His creatures' happiness; the strain Of hymns and harps toward Heaven, falls sadly short; And Creed, without Love, is not then belief. But from communion with his Father, Man Yearns toward his brethren in true godliness, In earnest faithâ That Faith is the soul's sight: And that same sight God hath vouchsafed it us As in the body, so in the soul too, Not to turn back upon the Giver His gift, In still rapt gaze beholding Him, but search And find, how the good means bestowed by Him May reach good ends; for Faith is no dull pool Reflecting Heaven, yet feeling not its Grace; But most like blood, a sprightly helpful thing, Cheerful and warm, with all enlivening Love, Speeding a thousand ways to a thousand ends; Ever in exercise, yet confess'd more By duty done, than by profession shown. He were a madman, who should redden his cheeks And deem it blood: yet that were all as wise, As whoso doth some solemn services And calls it his religion. Aye, 'tis the nameâ But, prithee, say, why so superfluous To give that name, where, save the name itself, Is nothing? Oh! but we are fooled by our ears Against the wisdom and witness of our eyes: And a high-sounding word fills many a gap Where deeds should be: and such a word art thou, Religion, as knaves utter, and fools think To understand thee; but the truthful thing Which that same word so oft doth counterfeit, 'Tis not as many deem, a shadowy nun, Unknowing of the world, cloyster'd away To lonely prayer, and pale contemplative Sad twilight, cheerless of the genial sun; Growing from gloom to night, a death-like life: But rather, a quick stirring quality, Likest to fire; which is not fire indeed, Unless it light and warm, enliven and cheer All things around it. Patriot zeal, 'bove all. Shame that from this high call thy fainter sons Shrink, self-distrustful. 'Tis a fresh soul breathed In the old man, so thoro', as henceforth He feels in darkest danger and distress The presence and protection of his God, And in that strength is strangely confident 'Gainst all the world. Would'st thou then take on thee High enterprise, daring and dangerous, Be thou religious. Trustfully look up And boldly down: believing evermore In Truth, as the helmsman doth in the Pole-star, And steering thy life-track from thy belief; So shalt thou turn thy brow to adamant Against thy gainsayers. Nor doubt, nor dread, But doing all as from the bidding of God. âGo, do it.â Our greatness is but in our great Fatherhood, sprung from HeavenâNature to Grace, Man unto God, must be regenerate, Then from his little self, the worm he was, Shall feel a sudden strength to wield the whole world Within him, and rise o'er the world without. Then as the heaven is high above the earth, So shall his glowing Faith surmount his fear, Till the hugest fear show faint as a far cloud. And the most stormy blast Danger can blow, He will lay bare his head, open his breast, To brace his nerves by its breath, âDanger, come onâ Thou threatenest sharply, but must soon flit o'er, A bitter wind, yet welcomeâfor thou driv'st The clouds, and bid'st the man bestir himself, Girding the tighter his loins. Storm on, I'll strive In silence stern against thee.â Such strong tower Is the Lord's faith, and such, invoking it, Was the spirit that possess'd young Hermann's soul, Transnatured, not to be of earth no more. And in that spirit did he feel more strength Than twenty thousand men could give to him. He started up from sleep, as the sun looked In at his window, wakeful unto work, Upstarted, but to wilder consciousness From wildness of his dreams. âIs it I am here, Or do I dream the man, Hermann by name, And I anotherânay, thou'rt heâbut how? Some few days back a mild shepherd of souls And now a Rebelâheadstrong and headlongâ Awful to speak itâand to undertakeâ Must change my thoughtful self into a rash Blaze of foolhardiness. What I essay Is harder than e'er man, a million-fold. But have I million'd in myself the means Of other traitors? To the proof, can I strike Yon mountain from its stand with my clenched fist? Wield that old oak for a spear? or by behest Of wizard power beswarm the moor with men, Each bush to be a soldier? Can I this? Aye and much more: the harder, the hopefuller. Welcome each cross! may kill me, not my cause. Come whate'er may, I'll meet it in God's name, And by God's strength.â Forth from his bed he sprang As he was wont, with a swift sudden spring, And washed him, the whole man, from head to foot, Quickening all his blood into a glow By the healthy water flushâthen to his host: Whose downward step he heard awhile before For early household work. âNo, all I need Is an oaten cake and porringer of milk. This time unwillingly waste on mealsâ Or talkâthe deed's the word: now is night by, The sun is upâthat sun betokens our own Forelighting us: our day's at hand; our fire Yearns forthâand soon this land, late but a huge Lazy unwieldiness shall blaze with it. Well, we've the start of them, we're stirred betimes, And early is half-done. Only 'twere well We follow what's before us with like speed. Therefore must sow surmise in the folk's ear By friendly tongues: scatter intelligence Not full, but sparks for tinder. Stir their souls That they be watchful, ready to take arms, For faith, this lightning time betides no less, Swifter than e'er our fishermen took oars When a shoal is shouted. E'en as the course goes, So further it. For, raise but once our own District, the whole land flashes to a blaze, Such as shall draw the popular wild breath With roaring draft to sweep it on. Then shout Our strongestâthey will answer, thunder-like, Peal upon peal, with rolling, crashing roar Thro' yonder mountains: but time's scant; I go.â He gave his hand, the shepherd earnestly Grasped it, as so with his good angel handfast, And looking a yet kinder speech than his words, âAye, Sir, be sure, I'll back you thro' and thro' Far as my life will reach. As the old man spake, The tear, quick glistening, stood on Hermann's eye, That answer his affection wrang from him, He gave none else; but striding forth, breathed in Eagerly that cool highland healthfulness; Looked on the landscape round, bright, beauteous, calm, Till summer had suffused his soul; and like The giant son of earth he felt new life From Nature's kind communion: then o'er the hill; Brushing his dewy way thro' tangled grass And goss: thence downward, where a thin mist-curl Hovering, marked the windings of a brook, Itself unseen: a minute moreâhe stood Upon its bank: musing his early years: For he looked on it with congenial love; So often in that stream his thirsty chance Had he slaked, and plunged its pools. He paused, for it poured Over, not gliding smoothly, as heretofore, But breaking wide, big with the night's rain storm, Swollen outrageously. He paused and thought: âMy pretty rivulet, whither away So rashly? thou dost o'erflow with foam As thou wert madâis it in truant play, Or of some wild ambition thou dost roam? Surely I have a project thou wilt say; Nayâhold theeâthou'rt best, channell'd in thy home: There happiest if only feeling soâ For this thy birthland feeds thee from her breast, Motherly, from her springs and hills of snow; And in full many neighbouring homes thou'rt blestâ Why then this flooding curse? let the flocks go Freely to drink of thee as they like best. But thou'rt an idle overweening thingâ Must be more than thyselfâand thy proud thought Hath puffed thee up, fondly imagining, Not to content thee, working as thou'st wrought; And that same storm of yesterevening Hath swollen thy pride full; yet a day's drought, And thou wilt shrink to thy poor self again. But, prithee, tell me, what dost hope to win Of worthy profit from thy wasteful pain? Why overflow with peril, hate, and sin? Nay, keep thy course, and blend thee with God's main. Thou know'st the evil end, wilt yet begin? Yes, rashling, for thou'rt proud. I pity thee For thy pride's sake. Yet haply 'tis not so: And thou art swollen, only to hinder me From yonder path of danger that I go: I thank thee much, but there's a destiny Rules me above, and I must serve belowâ Yesâthou and I are fellows in like fate, And there's a doom driveth us ceaselessly, That we may never bide in even state. Well, be it so, and forward fearlessly; But thou in thy safe bed, my happier mate, While I, through shoals and rocks, to my storm-sea.â He staid not, peering, to pick carefully His passage o'er the stones, huge, but smooth-worn, That some kind soul, whom Heaven requite again, Had set them there, instead of a bridge-way, But rushed into the roaring foaming stream, E'en thro' its darkest depth. âAs I stand now, No time to tamper nicely with my means, But boldly on to the end.â He scrambled up, So minded, as who plunges headlong in, And must screw on his utmost heart and strength To struggle thro'. His dripping clothes chilled not, Nay, but refreshed him; quickly dried with the wind And his warm blood: e'en ere he reached that door, Was shut for him last eve; but haply now May welcome himâsuch message overnight Had Hess besought him. He looked round, and all Was summer-sweetness, fresh as the dawn-dew, That e'en the smoke seem'd to rise cheerily Above the glistening thatch: and from their hives Ranged trimly, southward, the bees, to and fro, Made merry music. There was jessamine And mingled roses arbouring the porch; And in the little garden many flowers And yet more fruit: glad sight for a glad heart, But not for his. He turned and raised his hand Heavily, and knocked heavily on the door, And he was answered with so heavy a clang As all were empty and death-cold within, That his heart sank to hear it: as he knocked, So did that watchful granddame of the house Steal from an upper window her shrewd glance, Wrapt her cloak round, muffled her headgear on, And straight was hurrying down; but that her son, Raised by the same alarm, encountered her, And asked her of that early visitor, Who he might be. Then at young Hermann's name, As in shrill peevishness she uttered it, He stayed her hurry with mild voice and hand, Himself to give him audience. âWelcome, Sir, Most welcome to our house and household too, Last night I looked for theeââ So said the host, And his wan guest being seated, thus again: âYou know me, my young friend, you know us all. You know how our affection holds thee dear, As the dearest claim of kin: the proof of this 'Tis not words onlyâour hearts, both alike, Affirm the faith of itâso much for usâ Now for my daughterâShe is maidenly, Gracious and pitiful, lovely and fair: And they who see but the outward mood of her Rate her but so: a low unworthy rate. I need not tell thee, conscious so thyself; Whether of my forepattern or God's will, I may not surely sayâbut there she isâ A soul so inly glowing for our cause With heat so thoro' and withal so high As cares for that one thingânought else in the world, To see it thro'âand frankly as the child, So is the father tooâvouch me this truth; For none is so well ware of its as thou: That I am self-devoted, man and means, I and all mine, all that I have or hope, My life and daughter, and everlasting soul, To this high trial. Now then, in few words: When I disclosed it to thee awhile since Thou did'st shrink from it, as it seemed to me; Or else thy words were of so faint a breath As fits not our strong fiery fellowship; Lest what some utter other weaklings feel, Catching the sick contagion. From that time The hope I had of thee, fairly to fling Thy fortunes in among us, was no more: Therefore when Linsingen outspoke himself For better or for worse, to be our friend, If Lucy on that pledge would be his wife; I made his suit my ownâwaived thee awayâ And all the love I bore theeâall that a sire Can bear a son, I did surrender it To another love, yet higher than that one, The zeal of Christ, my country, and mankind; And so then faith is plighted on both sides, And she his helpmate, and he truly ours, Aye and our leaderâfor I yielded him, Nay, not to him but to our need of him, My headship, hope and all; yielded it up Freely, as life, when wanted, will I too. Now if thou'rt wronged in this, why thou art wrongedâ And I am the wrongdoerâhold me suchâ My conscience quits me, an' if thou condemn: Only misdeem me not, that selfishness Or aught unmanly or unworthy swayed me In this my sacrifice: for 'tis no less: And what I've done, much gladder would undo, Since thou art proven of lateâhaving fulfilled Thy undertaking far beyond thy word: As lofty minds are wont. It grieves me sore That thus thy merit should fall short of its meed; Yet can I offer thee no guerdon more Than thy own conscience hath assured to thee, Nor no more needs; high-minded as thou art. Howe'er, 'tis done, and regret looseth not The bond, that haste, our need, and ill-luck too Have tied threefold.â âSir, 'tis a grievous thing,â Hermann in faltering utterance answered him: âTo lose what we have cherished earnestly Is sad in things of lesser dignity: Much more in this; that once filled my whole heart, Now waste: 'tis sad, but wrongfulânot at all. No wrongs do I bewail me, nor feel none: And what must be, I undertake to bear As a man should: therefore my former love Is so foregone to me as a fond dream, Happy, but hopeless, if forgotten e'en so. But on that other ground, for furtherance Of Right and Freedom, our fellowship was built: That ground stands strongly yet, as heretofore, And there I make my stay. Sir, it may be, The love by me so cherished, and as I hoped, Not wholly to your daughter unendeared, Might well have been a cheering light to me Along that perilous path, but light or dark, The path stands open, and I will follow it, With the like faith if not with the like cheer. And Sir, that Linsingen hath this new spur I think it well befallen. He is rich And noble; and much I feared lest by those two Dull drawbacks hinderance, he should become Laggarder in our cause than forwarder. But now 'tis well. Sir, there's one thing I'd ask: To see your daughter: and so hear from her What I have good assurance from your lips, But yet would fain from hers.â â'Tis fairly asked, Wait but her coming.â He went, Hermann alone Remainedâ'twas a short time, but wide enough For thousand wishful thoughts to crowd between Confounded wildly in one; thronging like motes, Tho' sunless: aimless too. Then all was still Save the unruly beating of his heart That broke the stillnessâsoon another sound That none might hear save those who listen'd it, A quick light step, then a soft hand, yet strong, Upon the door, and gliding thro' the room A youthful phantom of pale loveliness, Lovely tho' pale. Thence the more marble-like Was her stern feature, and thin bloodless lips, And deep set eyes. She moved as in a dream For her old love came surging from her heart And with its deep sorrow enveloped her As with a cloud. She stood, and had sunk there Ere she could speak: but Hermann hastily Uprose, and took her hand and seated her, In deep heart-anguish drooping speechlessly, That so she might again gather her mind From that distressâsadly he gazed on her, Then broke the sad pause, âLucy, look on me And speak, but one wordâsure we may be friends. Such severance hath no likelihood of hate, But pityâspeak to me, and let me hear, That this dark gulf but sets our friendship apart, No angry distance. Nay, but weep not soâ Thy grief embitters mine. Oh! answer meâ Only a wordââ âAnswer thee! yes, indeedâ But what to say? forgive meânothing moreâ Forgive me now as thou didst love me once, Whollyâso haply shall my pain be less. But noâthat I deserve notânor dare hopeâ Only forgive me.â âLucy, 'tis too muchâ Wherefore forgiveâno promise and no pledge E'er bound us, such as broken, had been blame; Only a dream of hopeâno, what thou'st done, I do commend it for a high-souled deed; But if thou lovest more the other word, Then do I tell thee I forgive it all, Freely as we forgive our dearest friends When seeking our best good. Nay, mark me thisâ Had I such hope and earnest, I myself, I'd done no less. Lucy, I loved thee muchâ Truly thou knowest, and no less faithfully I feel itâyet in patriot eagerness I had spent a hundred thousand loves like thine To win but one such man as thou hast gained On our behalf in lordly Linsingen: So, prithee, be content.â âNay, what thou say'st,â The maiden answered him with streaming tears, âIt shows thy spirit's greatness greater yet, And my sad trial sadder than beforeâ Oh wert thou but my brother! how bless'd then! How dearlyââ âLucy, deem it even so: I am thy brotherâwe're twin-born in soul, What would we more? only be thou indeed My own true sister in this enterprise, So shalt thou have not only a husband's love With stately wealth 'bove all I could for thee, But a brother's also. Yes, and by my faith, A sister's name is sweeter of the two, Soother and lovelierâless of earth in it, And more of heaven. Lucy, 'tis God's grace; And, for I deem it so, thy forehead I kiss For a most holy and baptismal sign That thou art sister'd to me. Ah! 'tis goodâ Never was I a brother yet before, And now I feel the spirit in my heart Like a winged angelâonly do thou too Hold this heart-faith and cherish itâfor now I leaveâa longer stay might not beseem; Farewellâbut yet one wordâhaply thou knowest There is a band of soldiers here hard by In Salzbergâsoldiers, but yet men no less: And not mere stocks for muskets as some are. There hath been some good seed among those men, And it hath taken root. Now in that force Young Edward Linsingen doth hold a charge: Their standard-bearerâwhat I know of him, I'd give this right arm he were one of us; For he's a high-tried metal, might help well Our hottest work: now Lucy for my sake, And yours, and Linsingen's, and the good cause, While yet your husband's love holds its first heat, Do thou ennoble it, worthy himself, From passionate to patriotâto stir up His brother, and work thro' him on those men To join hands with us, e'en as their hearts are. Wilt thou do this, the train were fired, the end Begunâour hopeâtheir downfal. I say, wilt? For sure the power waits upon thy will: And never did a woman's will before Wield a like power to this. Hast thou a soul Too look beyond thine eyes what shall be done In after years? Oh thou'll be glorified So high, that she of Orleans, the French maid, Shall be but a drab-wench, what she first was, By thy comparison. Yield us thus much, I do beseech thee, and so bless us all: Or rather, yield thine own good spirit its way 'Tis a brave guide.âThen, Lucy, shall I know What even now I trust thee, that thou'rt true: And leavest me, not wholly unbeloved, But for thy country's safe. Oh think of itâ And may the deedâthe shotâflash from the thoughtâ Lest some cross chance marr all. And now I go, Give meâno, not thy loveâthy blessing hence. Thy own true brother.â He kiss'd her and away, And she was left in a deep loneliness: And many thoughts came o'er her cloudily, Till at the last they fell into this frame:â Did I behold him And truly was it heâ All I told him And all he answered me? Noâfor in my blindness I did him a foul wrongâ Sure such words of kindness Could ne'er be from his tongue. Ah! thou art parted Wilt never turn again: Here, lone-hearted: Here must I remain. Were I only A reckless soldier lad! But thus lonely! Better I were mad. Then were anguish Lost in stormy strife, Now I languish A despairing life. Oh! it doth grieve me! Thou visitest me so, Only to leave me Deeper in my woe. While thou art present, All that we dreamt of yore, Lovely and pleasant, I dream it all once more. Then that home-vision A very tru h doth seem; Then my ambition Shows like a foolish dream. Yesâits high glimmer More distant doth appear; Fainter and dimmer Whenever thou art near. There a star lone gleaming That lights no home on earth: Here a blaze warm beaming From our bright household hearth. Alas! fond hearts are riven By anger and by scorn: But so to be forgiven Is harder to be borne. Yet noâthou'rt vanishedâ And my girl-weakness too Hence be it banishedâ Lo! here I rise anew. Gone is thy loved featureâ But others I see thereâ Many a grim stature All armed around thy chair. Or, is but a vision So troubles my poor brain? No moreâthis knifeâit cuts the knotâdecision, Thus am I thine again! She cut unmaidenly that silken thread And rose; and as she rose, her mother came To comfort herâbut what we bear in hand We may not always lay it on the heart. No, 'tis the mood within that makes it balm, Or gall and nettles. Lucy started up, Hearing the door ahinge; lest some strange soul In a familiar form should come to ask Merciless questions in another tone Than she must answer them. Who feels with us, He is our friend, father and mother too, In heart-affliction: and all else soe'er, Tho' 'twere all kith and kindred met in one, Are cold as nether clay: yet lovingly Her mother greeted, and kindly spoke to her: But 'tis the season brings the flower forth, The season and conspiring elements, And not one sun-beam onlyâ âLucy, he's goneâ He and thy father parted with kind words: And they're agreed to meet this day at the fair In Markstein: so our friendship abides whole: And faster than beforeâmore than so much Were all too dangerous. Yes, I grieve for him Deeply as thou, if not so bitterly: For he's a goodly youth: nor even then, When most I doubted did I deem him less. I'll take him to my heart, call him my son, As long I've loved himâyes, loved him so much, That 'twere my death, beholding both in one Both thee and him bound in so crazy a boat As every wave may wreck it. Ye are all hope Ye younger hearts, and we as wholly fear: And 'tis my fearfulness of love speaks now. But, for this sorrow none could then foreknow, I did, what yet I may undo. I'll send To LinsingenâI asked him for this nightâ To stay him.â âNo, oh no! I'll welcome him All that I can; only somewhile alone Leave me, oh, leave me: ere his time to come, I shall be ready.â Thus as they discoursed, Hermann was far away, far o'er the hills Whither Hope lured, and Danger drove his speed Hounding him at the heels. As the aged hind In some wide woodland range, Windsor, or the old Conqueror's antler'd waste, listens the storm Shivering in his hut thro' the howling night; Then forth at break of day glad of his fallen Fuel for winter fire, gathering in The wind-strown wrack, and binding to a heap What he found thinly scatter'd wide away, Wandering the uncouth wild; so Hermann fared: Scouring the hills for catchwood far and near To kindle; and for stout stuff, hearts of oak, To hold the blaze. They were as like to burn As he to fire them; a strong brotherhood, True Gospellers, so called, and so they were, Where every man was zealous, not alone With his own zeal, but with the fervency Of the whole host. They had been banded long But wisely: therefore by the lords of the land They were deemed only what they seemed to be Preachers austere and godly listeners: Aiming at Heaven; and for this Earth's estate How it were ruled, little regarding it, Nor caring to upstir. Thus while they grew Few watched their growth; none feared it: confidence, Thou'rt a good striker, but the sword saves not Without the shield. And so this brotherhood waxed, Spreading o'er all the region round about, Like a fresh fame: that whate'er working-man Belonged not to them, lived as one plague-sick, So shunned and evil-eyed. They'd a good cause; But goodness in this world is likely lost, As in Missouri's mud the Clearwater. And so with worldly wisdom's coarser means They worked to their true ends. No likelier cry Than of Religion to cry down a State When rotten: Treason is a fiery sword, And needs a fiery mood to handle it; A most enthusiastic eager mood: And this enthusiasm is a blaze That feeds on its own smokeâstrangely kept up, If, tho' we starve it of all bodily food, We diet it with vapours. Who sees clear, He is no zealot. Light outdoes for him Those shadowy dim shapes: but where none knows And each man may believe whate'er he list, There is the enthusiast the king. Then hail Religion, nursing-mother of that fire Shall blaze, like withered tow, our bonds. Those men So minded, like stern Cromwell's rugged saints, Had ever in their mouth the praise of God, And now war-weapons in their sinewy hands To execute sharp vengeance: to smite kings To the ground, and, smitten, bind them fast in chains, Them and their lordlings too. But, ere they built Their frame so loftily, they settled first Their groundwork; broad and deep, tho' without show In the folk's depthâboldly yet warily They wrought; with friendly, godly fellowships, Meetings for furtherance of mind and soul Thro' teachers, bibles, tracts: covering withal Far other drift, unsaid, yet understood. Swift stirring, as tho' lightning were life-power And slackness death to them. So surely it is. Moorage nor anchorage Rebellion hath none, Nor havenâmust keep course, tide, wind, or steam, Else stranded. 'Tis the forward throng, the glow, The shout that drawsânot rabble straw and trash Alone, but worthier willsâthe shallowest stream Quick-glancing, with its wimmer and rash play Catches the eye more than the deepest pool. So briskly thro' their body coursed the blood In many a warm vein; and lest the head O'erstrained, sicken the heart, and youth, droop faintly In pale chill learning 'neath the teacher's shade, Befitting old world-worship and priestwont, Rather than forward Will; therefore with games (Meaning much more than gamesomeness alone) Of force or skill, ball, cudgel, marksmanship, They strengthened each strong limb and lusty will. Nor lacked they emissary means, between The main and its far members, nor discourse To quicken zeal with words, and shrewdly sift State thingsâthen songs and music, such as stir The patriot spirit; earnest newspapers Whence fame should blow her trumpet blast abroad, Tidings and teachings, what they breathed in it. Shadows and seemings theseâbut oft their show Works stronger than all substance, shot or steel; For spirit alone is matter. Tribute too They had, paid duer, tho' self-taxed, than Law Can wring from sullen bondsmenâso their life With thoro' will and conscious fellowship Glowed warmâone frame, one trust, ordered thro'out, And organized. Thus strong their sumâthe State Must heed it well, or risk their staggering shock, And if luck help them, utter overthrow. Such was the brotherhood, holy at first Then rebel; but rebellion against man Is oft loyal to Godâand such the hope And eager meaning of that thronging crowd Highway and byway toward Markstein fair, A throng but yet no tumultâsteady and stern, E'en as their purpose was: for the fame ran, A gossamer fame, floating everywhere, Whence none could tell, that something should be done That day so signal, and so deeply stamped, Should overlive the records of yon rocks, Aye, and the rocks too. The soothsayer's word Sometimes fulfils itselfâthe fabled power With breath to beget body, is none but his. Faith, if these men, here at the festal fair Bear them so dourly, how when battle meets Edge against edge? what then their likelihood? Such thunder-cloud and lightning never friend Of mine encounter it. But, is this land Harried by war, and the boors hurrying forth, That so each road is full as a high-tide, One stream speeding one way? no, not yet warâ But soon may be. 'Tis noonâfairtime and groundâ They meet as did their merry forefathers, And sure 'tis a full musterâall around The country is unpeopled, that yon moor May swarm with a strange life. There are they met In that soft combe, widening 'twixt rough crag-walls; And there is all custom traditional, Caravans, booths, and shows, and antic games, But no man heeding them. Is mirth clean gone, Laughter lost from the land? Is eagerness Of curious presentation and strange sight Outjostled from Man's mind? 'twere hard to say; But all things here betoken it e'en so: For where fair-folks should wonder at his show, The show-man, all forlorn himself, comes forth, Wondering what spell kept back the muttering throng Outside his booth. Whoever then should say That fun and frolic were dead suddenly, And gamesomeness frowned down on the boor's brow, There was enough to warrant what he said, In what all eyes might see. Considerate groups, Speakers most earnest, and staid listeners, Brows downward bent in cloudy seriousness, Instead of careless gay festivity, As then beseemed them. Is it the world's end, Or other awful looming prophecy, They look to see fulfilledâa funeral fairâ Yes sureâwith death to many. Whate'er 'tis, There is no need conjecture task herself: Here comes the proofâfar on the utmost edge Of that dark moor, an uproar seethes and swells, From scouting boys, in fearful skurry wild, Like some mad shallow torrent foaming in At corner of a lakeâsuch sudden stir 'Stead of its own deep calm. Who had vantage ground Looked thither, whence the growing danger came; And what they saw, interpreted the sight To those whose tip-toe strained bewilderment Might not avail to give them their eyes' use. âAh! 'tis the yeomanryâyesâsure enoughâ See thereâand those scared urchinsâand men tooâ Shame on the runaways. Why against us Those few score loons are spray against the rock: Ah, lookâthey've made a standâ'tis manly done. Face but about and keep the horsemen offâ Ayeâsoâthey're stopp'd outrightâcan do no more Than sheep at a stone-wallâbut nowâwhat nextâ Why, they're at parley. Ah! 'tis but lost wordsâ Likely would have our rebel ringleaders Giv'n o'er to themâto die, I warrant ye. No, as one fares, so will we allâlike work, Like wageâno odds in fellowship.â So spake Some high outlooker to the throng around, But suddenly, speakers and hearers, both Confounded, were borne off by the eager rush Thither upstreaming, where, as seemed most like Blows should be bandiedârabble-like along, Coward and bold, in outward drift alike, For how should a poor water-drop fall back Against the ocean tide? So the foremost Where hustled blindly by their followers 'Mong the angry horsemen, struggling helplessly As scattered wreck 'mid rocks. Such strife is cloud- Born, who begat it, who knows? nor matters much, When once two flaming brands are laid across Which catches first the other. Those armed men, Their ranks so broken, and their horses scared; First loudly threatening, next with flat swords, Or with blunt stroke thrust the intruder back: Thence anger and fierce words, stones flung, arms raised; 'Til last, as gushed the blood forth from a wound Of yeoman sabre, swift upon the stroke As thunder upon lightning, a gun-shot Crashed through the striker's forehead. âAye, tis doneâ Now is no faltering for us,â cried Ernst, Bellowing o'er the uproarââblood for blood, And life for lifeâso will their watchword be, And so must ours. Smite them with the sword's edge The Philistines, the bloody Amalekites, Whom whoso spares to slay, sins against God. The murderous gang, they come to trample us Beneath their horses' heels, widow our wivesâ Well thenâour life 'gainst theirs. Yon crag henceforthâ The blood-rock shall men call it. Up, friends up, Requite them in God's name. Spare no soul home To tell his comrades slain; smite, I say, smiteâ Upon them boldly, as ye see me do, E'en so yourselves the like.â Ere he had said, He was already 'mong his foes amidst Hewing to right and left with an old broadsword, Laid up since many years: till, on this day, The crimson flowing blood dimmed the red rust Was erst upon it. From so grim onslaught Fearfully they fell back, those yeomanry, From danger glaring on them, as cur-dogs When a tiger bursts his den: so did they flee Not so to 'scape: they looked for stones and staves Clownish, all weaponless of other war, Which they who wield them against steel and shot Are but sheep against wolvesâfor such they looked, And what they saw, needed no second sight, That one sufficed to curdle their hearts' blood. âWoe, woe, we thought no danger, and here we are Far from our wives and from our merry hearths In such a whirl of hell.â Those wrathful men Were in with them, as hewers among wood, Striking as pitilessâflashed in the air A hundred guns from 'neath the gray frieze coats And hissed a hundred shotsâyet faintly heard Amid the cursed uproar and fierce shouts Drowning all else: then, who had space to flee Turned each his horse, and with loose rein away Where outlet was. The rest a wildered throng, Horses and men, rearing, plunging amain, Striking or shouting, or dashing down aground; And there beseeching with their latest breath Mercy, which asked of God, were their last prayer Best spent, of Man all hopeless. Oh, that field, Was such a one devils might look upon And for their fellows take a lesson away From Christian proof, of hate fiercer than Hell. Only there lacked more fuel for that fire To hold its pitch. Blood-thirstiness was blanked Ere slaked with slaughter. For the latest feat, When all resistance else was smitten down, Christopher Ernst, as 'gainst a dying man Stretched on the turf aback, he upheaved his sword, Raging for blood in its hot sympathy With the hand that held it, sudden his stroke failed. And his brains, spatter'd by a pistol shot Sprinkled that trooper; whom the film of death Had not bedimmed his certainty of eye, Ere he took aim. âAnd so doth wrath, o'erstrained,â Said Hermann, gazing sadly on the corse, âForedo itself. And where is thy fire now, Thou chilly lump of clay? oh, where indeed? Grant Heaven, as sure it hath gone forth from thee, And this thy hand is cold, we may be heirs To what was best of itâthou had'st enough Were we ten times the number that we are, To blaze us like dry stubbleâbut needs not. Thou'st done thy work already.â Musing thus, More and more hotly the crowd thronged on him; Doubting the bloody deeds they heard far off, Till they could see it. âHear me, my good friends,â Said Linsingen, as riot wilder grew, âHere we have beat them off, and hope no less Whereso or when, hereafter meeting them: But not by this road only danger comes, Our foes are hasting hither, horse and foot, Wide as from East to West: therefore behoves Wariness, watchful afar; so every man Homeward; to tell these tidings and to hear Others: if aught of threatening likelihood, Bring it back hither; waiting, until then, What may befal, with outlook ready at once If e'er the beacon blaze.â They listened him Intent, as wisdom were in all his words, Then with one cheerful shout went several ways To do his bidding. He and the other heads With the main band of thoro' stalwart trust Having so rid the rabble off from them, Tarried for trialâdoubtful what next shouldâ Doubtful yet undismayed; and whisted each, Till others: for that dark stern danger stopp'd The breath of babblersâthen, as all there seemed To listen than to speak, the old Harper broke Blindly upon their silence in this strain:â âMy friends, a marvel hath been done, And ye stand wondering every one, And reason good ye have therefore For your clenched hands are grimed with gore: And shrieks and shouts, and rage and fear Ring yet within each wilder'd ear: And so ye stand all silently, But I must lift my voice on high: Tho' I have seen strange things likewise, E'en with these dead and darkling eyes.â Ye knowâI'm blind these many years, Ye see me in a flood of tearsâ That floodâ'twas thatâbrought back my sight, To see one moment of God's might. Blind as I am, I witnessed all The shout and onsetâflight and fall. And Ernst and others on our side, Who dared their death, and fought, and died, I marked their souls mount up on high In a strange glory to the sky: And my dear friends, ye know it wellâ Ye felt some sudden spirit's swell Driving ye thither, wild with zeal 'Gainst death and danger, fire and steel. Ye knew not what that drift might be, But it was all revealed to me. The spirits of your sires were there Careering 'bove you in the air, And swelling every patriot breast Like sails with sweeping winds possess'd: Waving their country's banner true And brandishing old arms anew. A radiant comfort to all here, But to the foeman a wild fear: And with the battle's fiercer blaze Still they grew brighter to my gaze, Till in one light'ning flash at last With victory's shout away they past. My friends, as God hath given me, E'en so the truth I tell to yeâ For I am old and like to die, Fiend have me if it be a lieâ Nor is it drink as scoffers say; No drop hath warmed this heart to-day. Sure then by such a sign 'tis shown That God himself is all our own. E'en the blest spirits for us fight, How should we falter? on forthrightâ Yesâin that Faith go boldly onâ But till your utmost work be done, I charge ye, by the living Lord, Lay ye not down your conquering sword.â âWell done thou brave old manâayeâbravely doneââ Thus the hot blood of Linsingen spake forth. âWhy this thy spirit lacks but a young arm, Then were it worth a thousand men to us To swell our strength.â âNay, but there's more in it,â Thus Hermannââbe ye sure there's more than seems. For that heart-glow how could it in that husk Without God's grace? Noâ'tis Heaven speaks in him, No less I hold it.â Then said Linsingen, âThen will we follow it. What think ye, Sirs? There lies Count Stolberg, stark and stiff, the corse Of this right hand; 'stead of his fiery threat Like whirlwind dust to drive usâthere he lies; And there his castle stands! stately and strong As he while'er the living lord of itâ What think ye? for the goodwill he hath shown Were it not meet to give him back as good, And storm his houseâpoor body he's but clay. And whatsoe'er we do it harms him notâ For how? look there upon himâand, for his sons, Their heritage is fallen ere its time By many yearsâand we who've hastened it, If we withhold it from them, 'twere no wrong. What say ye, shall we to the assault?â â'Twere bold,â Said Hermann, âa bold strokeâbut better soâ For the rebel's strength is sheer audacity. We're lost already, if we gain not all. Then why outwait the tide? if we would hope First we must dare. Then on, thou mighty man Of valour, whom the lord is leagued with theeâ Lead us, we'll follow.â âAnd, so Linsingen, Defence is a cold word; I like it not. And see in its cold spirit we stand now Chilling our flush of warmth: but to attackâ That breathes a hot defianceâblows its own Sparks to wild-fire. Oh, in the sharp onslaught There is a will and glowing energy That twice its numbers may not stand against. Must overthrow themâsure as these dead heaps; And so we will. Movement is warmth, and swift Is strongâturns this dull stone to a cannon ball. Then forward, forward, bold and lion-like To meet our danger and to grapple it: Sure we were better so than hunted out And skulk our doom, hare-heartedâsay, are ye such, To die so slavish? No, brave, friends we'll on, So will Opinion after usâwhose breath Must fill our banners, idle tho' it be, Drooping without it.â As he spoke, so all Shouted their loud accordâlook to thyself Thou ancient Castle, for if manly hearts And sinewy arms have aught of potency, There is so much of spirit in that shout, Bodes thee no good: look to thy strength, I say, That it be sure; for truly, they who come Will prove its surety with a most sharp proof. BOOK XI. Earnestness, thou art Man's true nobleness: I know not whence begotten, nor how born; But thou'rt of glowing bloodâdoughty and dour; God-like, if aught so be, that to Man belongs. Worthier of worship than the Persian's fire, For thou'rt the fire of the soulâor, if thou wilt, Soul of the fire, kindled high up in Heaven, That quickens clay to manhood. Yet, in the times When every knave that would set up a god And built a temple and called himself the priest, And took fat gifts, when many of no worth Were reckon'd worshipful, thou wert ne'er one. No altar raised, nor incense burned to thee. For truly, lofty and godly tho' thou art, Yet the priests love thee notâas guessing well Thou wert too true and righteous to love them: Who dost deny to give them what they ask Due to God onlyâself-surrendering Faith: Nayâbut rather its showâneeds them no moreâ True Faith to Fraud were irksome, importunate; As sound cloth patched on rottenâhateful as light To darknessâfearful as the forger is 'Mong many false to utter one true coin. Such fellowship befriends not, but betrays. Therefore they love not earnest searching Faith, But its blind counterfeit: priestly belief, A film darkening the soul, as scum the lake; Bedulling life; stagnating ever there Between the lively tide and Heaven's light: Severing the two; and barring God free grace From Man, tho' it professeth and should be The atoning reconciler between both. So, o'er the soul broods priestcraft, deadening Man's wholesome will, and quickening instead The swarm of childish fond conceits, on fear By darkness, slim-begotten. Priestliness For godlinessâthis scum our Gospellers Would clear; and show Faith's surface, that the sky May shed its own unsullied light on it. But noâpriestcraft is better interposedâ (So the priests say, and so many believe, For mostly they're good, holy men, and do Good work, tho' sometimes by ill means untrue), To bate that lustre; to o'ercloud the clear Sun, lest it dazzle with excess of light. Such their kind forethought for our weak babe-eyes: And therein worldlings, who hate earnestness, Love priestcraft; crouching in blind cowardice, Self-knowing, self-distrustingâwould forego All manly choice and conscience, duty and right, So, slave-like, skulking to shirk Manhood's trust Of Freedom, and the Will's responsible work. Such ghostly sires, such earthly sons. Oh come Some one who dares be true, clear the fat scum From its surface rule, disauthorize the craft, And free us all to godly Faith: aye, come, Whoe'er thou art, and be that burning sign Which they shall conquer in it, who follow it: Some Thrasybulus, bold yet wary, a wise Head, with warm heart and stalwart hand; self-sure In his self-strength: so watching eagle-like From Phyle's height, to smite down slavery. But be thyself, earnestness, be thyself. Thouâwho dost bear Faith's stampâManhood's own seal, Nay, soulâbut Manhoodâwhat is that but Will? And Patriot Will is now but feverish heat Fitful, self-smouldering in its own smoke. Come then, be thou the spirit and soul of it, A fiery spirit, a most eager soul. Scattering doubt and fear, as darkness flees Before the high-raised torch: Men look for thee Now, this long time: and when, tho' late, thou com'st, So eagerly they'll greet thee, thronging up, As from Hell Heavenward. Only know thyself, How strong thou art, how weak thy enemies: The people in all lands how sworn to thee, To end what thou beginn'st: then do but thou Pitch thy call loud enough, they'll answer thee With such full force, so like an ocean flood, As all resistance must be whelmed in it, Nor heart nor hand no more. Yes, Earnestness, Be but thyself, and feel, and prove thyself, Thou thorough searching fire, tho' but in one Spark of thy pure and pristine quality, That were enoughâfor the rank luxuriance The o'erweening umbrage of that feudal old Forest, that cumbers Earth with a few tall trees, Stately but few; that so o'ershade the ground With baneful growth, that myriads of more worth Sicken beneath their shade, and only weeds, Brambles and vapours live on loathsomely; That rank luxuriance and those tall trees Are doated unto tinder; rotten at heart; And there's a strong wind blows, and stronger yet Threatens its blast, and that first spark of thine Where it shall catch, there shall be such a blaze As Earth hath never seen, no, nor e'er shall, Till it be caught itself in the fire-clutch Of some wild comet. Then shall fruitfulness Grow from the ashes of that old rank growth And righteousness award the harvestage For happiness. And can'st thou see such things Thou daring champion, and not grasp thy sword To conquer them? but ah! liv'st thou indeed Or only some faint flickering shade of thee, Mocking thy manly life? I fear thee much That thou'rt thyself no more. Oh for one hour Of the olden time, when patriots wielded swords, And virtue then meant manhood: now 'tis words, Words all, and nought but words. Curse on the breath That doth compose them; its heat is sickening, And spreads its faintness over the whole world. Clouds without rain, and winds whirling but dust. Therefore ye slaves who would fain brag yourselves So loudly into men, be stillâand ye Tyrants, henceforth outtyranize yourselves, And gag men's tongues: what now we utter in words, Then were we all the likelier in deeds: For Silence is a dark but quickening womb Wherein great thoughts grow to life-truths, and hopes To harvest home: forth in full shape they come At their full hour; while speech had scattered them In its most busy silly impertinence Abortive ere their time. But, Earnestness, Thine is the strong hand, not the babbler's tongue: Therefore thou talkest not, but at the time Strikest full soreâGod speed thee and thy stroke, That both may thriveâif not, small harm to thee. Thou'rt strong, and in thy strength can'st outbide more Than others can inflict. The sun was low While yet that conflict raged on Markstein Moor, And many when outfought, deemed it enough Of death and of destruction for that day: And fain had sheathed their swords, and rested there 'Till morrow: but 'tis swiftness, ever on, Dazzles the foe with changeful alacrity; And catching many points, now here, now there, Kindles abroad the outbreak, sinking else, If not astir; must snatch success from the blazeâ Swiftsure alone is luckyâthat bold truth, They wrought out boldly, those rebellious men, Mindful that whoso from Law's bulwark stirs One stone, is guiltyâwould he cancel his guilt, Must break right thro'âsternlyâa full clear breach, Outright, victoriousâpalterers are self-doomedâ Who dares the most rues least. Thoro' wins tho'. For rebel craft can never square itself Level to Lawâmust raise Rebellion o'er Law's Level. Ere that first field was fought, the sun Sloped westward, and with the evening star-gleam The Stolberg garrison 'scaped from the moor To the strong shelter of their castle walls, Had looked their latest on both sun and star, And died a bloody death. 'Twas an old pile, Fortress and mansion, answering either call As need might be: tower and battlement, Drawbridge and moatâsuch strength as had kept out The sudden robber in marauding times: But now, since centuries with their deep calm Had stilled suspicion to security, It lay like an armed warrior in repose: Armed else in thoro' proof from head to foot Only his gorget off. Surely he breathes More freely so in such loose luxury; But surely too in that unguardedness His throat lies open to the thrust of sword, Fooling all other trust of his defence By that one gap. There was the deep dark moat, Must drown all fording foes, stifled in mud, Ere stroke of onsetâonly it was dry. A traitorous drought; for there the attack made way, Wolf-like, bursting in wildly, every sideâ No other order but their disarray, No forecast save a twinkling to draw breath, For one fierce shout hurling defiance forth, And then fall onâtruly, a grim onslaught, And grimly the defence encounter'd it. For those withinâthat was their life's last holdâ And well they knew it. Mercy was far offâ Far as Hope from Despair: for there was due A forfeiture to death: bound for their lives, And they or else their foes to quit the bondâ Therefore 'twas sternly fought. At the first brunt While those without answered but with their shouts And heavy strokes the death-shot from within; Doors were burst thro' and the barr'd windows stay Out-stormed by dint of axe. Entrance is clear. Victory wonâOh, where is Mercy now? Alas! what should she here, or how prevail O'er the fell spirit of the conqueror, When e'en the vanquished call her not to come But die despairingly. So ever on Slaughter hunted her game from room to room From stair to stair: before her shrieks and groans, Blood and corse-heaps behind. Ever she smote And smiting never slacked while any stood Against her sword: then on the last man's groan Upheaved in gushing blood, came a short hush; A stillness all the deeper and deadlier, For the wild uproar that foreclamour'd it. Then many went about, muttering low, With teeth hard set, and swords strainingly clenched, Whom next to slay: and finding no live soul, Must hack the dead, savage and butcherly For lack of other vengeance: for bloodthirst Is so assuaged by lavish draughts of it As fire by profuse oil. Well was it then, Women and children were all fled that hold, None left but weapon'd men: for anger once Kindled, is stirred by the fiend, fiercer to blaze The more 'tis fed: 'scaping the thought of the past By raging on; knowing nor practising No readier means to efface a few blood-drops But to ensanguine allâbathing its hand In reeking slaughter thoro'ly embrued Lest white and red should know distinction, For one to accuse the other. Cruelty Thou'rt ever bitter, but then bitterest When self-called Conscience. In that home Death swayed And dumb awe followed, staring haggardly; But soon was jostled awayâfor energy Breathes only in the stirring atmosphere Where it was born: and recklessness loves not That its fierce trouble should subside in calm. Lest so its conscience become clear, its drift From turbulent declared transpicuous With guilt at bottom: therefore those stern men, Their bloody excitement o'er, some other needs To drive them on: such other was at hand. For in that hall sulphurous and carcase strown, A feast was spread, viands in plenteous show. Wine, and what else is of more potency To fire the bloodâstrong comfort of faint hearts: And bold ones too. âHo! there!â cried Linsingen, âThere's a home-friend shall chase the phantom-mists That spring from spilth of blood; clearing our brains Of ugly bugbear shows, cleansing our throats From the rank gory smack that sticks to them. Fill up, drink out.â Sudden they did beset Those high-piled tables; and drank, shouted, and laughed, Bemocking in mad glamour those dead men For drunken mates. All save some nine or ten Who took but bread and water, scantly too, In token of cool blood and conscience true; Feverless, passionless: a holy calm After a holy deed. So fared those few. But for the multitude, soon as the blaze Of their high-flaring spirit had burnt off, Then earnest conference came, and hubbub wild, And loud debated strife: some to stay there, Others, rash onward. Long ere their rough wills Clashing together, fell into one frame Of seemly even fitness: long it was, But so at last: dissonance lower'd its din, Confusion grew to calm. Then one stood forth, The shepherd, manly and free as his lone life, For loneliness begets free manliness, And to the heads of the assembly thus: âSirs, I bespeak your hearing, on behalf Of these hardhanded fighters, standing here, And by their biddingâsturdy menâstrong erst At work, and now in war, as their foes proved, Who live not to give witness of their proof. But stronger than we are, henceforth we must To hold our winning hope: marry, the need Is easy shown, but how to answer it, There is the stress. Well, Sir, we commoners Have undertaken to be counsellors This once, and but thus farâonly to say What best we know, and you may best avail. Sir, we have many sidesmen waiting us Ashore and inland: miners brooking ill Their hard bread taxed yet harder; smugglers, too, Who had as lief blow out the exciseman's brains As pay his dueâno lovers of the Law, Rather of those who live most lawlessly; Now, Sir, needs but a breath, a beckoning hand To stir them up: and for their reckless lives, Tho' for that cause we now stand off from them, Yet, Sir, methinks, if stones must needs be thrown, It were no wise man's way to reject those Fittest of all and readiest to the hand, For a little dirt that may chance cleave to them; Rather beware the rich; Law is not right Always, nor they worst men who gainsay its wrong, Tho' hence they bear its brand. Lord Â£ s. d. Is a sneaking skulking coward. Such Christ's word, That wealth is worldliness; But, Sirs, these menâ Linsingen, so we all think, were likeliest To go among them. 'Tis but to light up A blaze upon some headland, at dead night, By scores and hundreds they'll come thronging in. And once together, what they know of him, They'll follow him be sure thro' fire itself To the last upshot. We, if it seem good, Will look, meanwhile, to Hermann for our head With no less trust.â Silence ensued this speech Boldly delivered, but heard doubtfully, For Linsingen, to whom it most belonged, Lent it no willing ear; but with knit brow And compress'd lips, first scanned the speaker, as pride Forbids presumption, listening scornfully, Then looked around for other's utterance Rather than give his own. They whisted awhile, For answer deigned he none, by word or show; Till after parley 'mong the leaders there, As with much urgency they counselled him, At last he spoke:ââMy friends, were all things else Belonging to this sudden unasked advice, Praiseworthy as the will that prompted it, Then wellâbut 'tis not always the best will Gives the best warrant. Other duty is mine Than to trudge round the country. For this need If such it be, I'll meet it as behoves; But what ye've given me of authority As I alone must answer it abused, So would I hold its use in my own hands, Whollyâmore said were o'ermuchârule I must, But not give reasons.â He spoke moodily, As one much roiled; but while his speech yet filled His hearer's ears, Hermann rose hastily 'Gainst discord. âBrethren, I beseech ye, as so Named, be so foundâbut what is brotherhood Aloof from unity? while we are one So are we stronger than our muster seems, But severed once, then are we powerless As were these limbs of mine, torn from their trunk By bloody violence. Why, my dear friends, Why was it that we chose us freely a head, But for his counsel to be ruled by it? That he might frame and we fulfil the work, Following him wherever, hope or none. Then why more words? rather abide on our choice, Encroach not upon rule. Noâfor if trust Be once fly-blown with busy surmises It turns to a maggot-heap of jealousies, Feeding upon the substance of their cause Till utterly consumed. Beware we lestâ But noâthe thoughtâe'en thus I scatter itâ Then be content as I most truly am, To follow, not to lead: else are we lost. But for this end to raise those miners up, I know the men, their likings, ways, and means, And if it please our noble leader here, The peril and the hope of the enterprise I claim itâI, even I. Ye see me here, And if I have permission, and life hold, To-morrow's sun shall see me all as sure On the coastâa dangerous coastâas ye all know. And those our enemies here upon land Shall rue its dangerous men as fearfully As ever the seafarer rued its rocks. Sir, if you think to send such mission forth, I beg the trust of itâstaking my life For my reward.â Thus Hermann, and all there, Stood silent, wondering at his height of soul; Wonder past utteranceâno shout, no word, But only a still gaze. Then Linsingen, As quickened by some sharp spur, started up With warm heart-flush. âBrethren, I give him leaveâ Since he gives meâand when he parts from us, There parts a man, who, if he turn not back, Our hope were lost in his blank. Go, in God's name, Thou best and bravest! and, for I care not, To outlive the chance, may cost thy dearer life, Lagging behind when thou art in the van Of peril, therefore, for my share, I choose An undertaking all as fearful as thine. No matter whatâfor why? if it end wellâ If not, I say again, no matter still: For in its failure must we all fail too, Fortune and life: and this young hope of ours Suddenly from the brightness it now is, Shall darken over yet more dismally. And we must struggle in Death's yawning jaws Until he close them o'er us. So, if we fail,â Fail, my dear friends! but be it soâwhat then? Why, we shall ne'er live to be ware of it, We, who are well determined to die first. And so, my gallant Hermann, let's shake hands: For there's a spiteful something in sword and shot, May stiffen them to shake no more again. But who soars high o'ertops low ambushes, And thou'rt a towering spirit. Well, I too Will rise my loftiestâshall ne'er feel my fall, If Fortune strike me down. Then, if thou must Go, and God speed thee. Give him all your prayers, My trusty fellowsâfor if ye were saints, And they were blessings every one of them, He were well worth them all.â Hermann went forth 'Mid earnest feeling of the brotherhood: Much fear, slight hopeâthey were so summed in him. They fell upon his bosom, sore distressed For what he must encounter. There they stayed With meat and strong drink comforting the flesh, The groaning spirit with prayer: and thence he sped, Having none other comfort but heart's Faith, Nor needing more. Straight on to the sea-shore. No difference of brook, mountain or bog, Valley or level: straight as the sea-fowl From the howling North, of winter forebewarned Ere it besiege the icegirt Orcades, Wing thence their airy wedge. So straight he sped; So questionless. Night had opposed herself, One dark immensity, barring his sight; Therefore his early wont to guide his way Was his only load-star. So he struggled on Forlorn, yet hopeful, thro' his thoughts within, All else a blot: conning dark counsel, how best To speed the cause. 'Tis fearful so to fare, Unhomed, unmated, and of outward ken Helpless as the unborn babe: but doom itself Stoops to the downright will; and Hermann so Right forward from his outset reached his end In manhood trueâto the house of Zimmermannâ A host he liked not, but must sue to him For the cause sake. To the high spirit of Faith The scorner's sneer is like the serpent's tooth, Not hateful only, but of curdling chill To his warm glow: such scorner was that man, And Hermann was such warm enthusiast. Only not warm alone, but high and deep, And streaming forward strongly: therefore scorn Was carried down the tide it would fain thwart, Flushed by its faithful sway. From chill and fog To a warm homestead is a welcome shift, If the guest be welcome too. He greeted his host, And found all things set forth neatly and trim, An easy plenteous household: âthe world's weal Is far too wide; fulfil it I ne'er can: Better, so thought that patriot good manâ First try a tinier thrift in my own snug home; And for the rest, wishes and words must serve Till I've done here.â 'Twas shrewdly meant; more shrewd Than manly; and yet, in faith, I blame him not: Much less commend him. Only this be sureâ Mammon is evermore his muck-worm self; No rebel: something traitorous perhaps, But yet no rebel: and Milton erred, for once, That when the angel host fell off from Heaven He shared their fall. Oh no! for how should he leave His bags? how take them? Of late Zimmermann Had chewed the danger he had helped prepare, And ever as he chewed, that danger grew Bitterer to his taste. E'en then, that night As he sat musingly among his books In chair of ease, and cheerful circumstance, The oak-embers on his right, on his left hand A full rich glass, steaming most fragrantly: And he the while poring upon a hope Late proffer'd him, so to pass questionless Of old accounts, proving new loyalty. âIs ought so hateful in such life as this That I must leave it? aye, leave such a one For such another as I must take for it? Such stormy wild bloody unlikelihood. Why, I were wiser to go naked forth From this home-nook to the bleak howling moor, And pray the stars to warm me: and if they should It were no great wonder then that one We fools do hope for.â Oh! 'tis reasoned well, World-wisely too: and when, good Zimmermann, Thou didst profess thyself a patriot, Doubtless thou did'st but look for a lap-dog life By the fire-side; and they do wrong thee in most Unrighteous rigour, who ask ought else of thee, But just to be such a warm patriot As now thou art. Hermann so came on him, Cross-mooded thus: greeted him, and sat down; Told him the tale of all, from the shepherd's hut E'en to this hour: flashed forth the war again In fiery words; with brighter likelihood Than any else could seeâso bright and warm, As Hope had only to stretch forth her hand, And no such thing as Fear. Zimmermann heard, And as he heard, his wont of worldliness Was lost well nigh in feeling wonderment, While faintly glowed his face from its shrewd smile: And that same wonderment had been full faith, Had his white head been browner a few years. But the old are but the cinders of the young, And ever they take fire, they hold it not, But straight are cold againâso was that man. He answered not, but looked upon the lad As elders look on the rash thing they love Doomed to perdition: kindly he took his hand, And pausedâa feeling pauseâand spoke to himâ âYes, trulyâfair they are, tho' fruitless quite, The flowers thou hast shown me, and time was I might have cherished them fondly as thou: But now, grey as I'm grown, I know too much: Who flies so high seldom ends happily. But thou'rt a PoetâHeaven grant thou rue it not. And now, a moment's leave, I will say more When I return to thee,â he said, and rose, And parted. Hermann leant o'er the bright hearth, Watching its changeful embers; but much more Brooding o'er those late words: till thoughtful life Grew from their germ. Poet! oh no, that name Hath more of honour than I dare to claim. For how should Poesy, that high princess, Ally herself to my poor lowliness? NoâI never sued to her Save as a lone worshipper: Then why, thou foolish man, oh, tell me why, Confound the virgin with her votary? Poet! thou nam'st the name, But where is he Can claim to be That same. Not the faint Rhymester who but wrongs Manhood and speech by silly songs. But the Seer, who strikes aglow From his high soul the world below. For he doth gather many a ray Of vital Truth else perishing astray, Within his mighty centring mind to glower And thence glow forth in lightning powerâ Poetâmakerâso before Was the God we all adore. But on earth is no such oneâ A stray spark is not a sunâ Never wasâbut yet may beâ Only show him unto meâ I'll worship him with bended knee. Yesâfor the haughtiest might well bow down To him, whom all the glittering stuff That the world calls its wealth, were not enough To purchase him his crown. Such crown of glory, as 'twere meet Our lowliness should lay it at his feet And so arise From that deep reverence, devoutly wise. But noâMan's happiest frame Were all too coarse to hold that holy flame. NayâPoetâI am noneâ Hallow that nameâfor 'tis a holy one. So I were that, I would be all beside All scorn soe'er that mortifies Man's prideâ Blind and beggar'd, crippled, maimed, Naked and yet not ashamed. I would leave all else behind, And go forward with my mind. For say, doth the lone star lament Because it hath no store Of gold or silver ore? Oh no, it is content To shed its soul in light, Tho' nations heed it not, to wake from their dull night. For there is one That heedeth all, whate'er is done; And hath delight In all things true, and high, and bright: The truer, and the brighter, and the higher The nearer himâthe liker to the Sire. A Poetânay, but the Poet that one must be. For thousands have put forth the claim, Hundreds have been called the name! Souls that from their inward glow Sparks of Poet-life would throw. And of these some nine or ten, Work with some slight power on men. But that full power belonged but to the oneâ The sire gave it to the son. Made him the makerâPoet trueâ To kindle Manhood thro' and thro' Thrilled with his conspiring faithâ Now needs a new creative breath: That faith to realize in deedâ Thou Poet-doerâthine is the great work and meed. Would I were heâfor how soon then Were my name made a marvel among men! YesâI would dedicate that fire To purify this world of mire, Thrilling atoms from their strife With electric glow of lifeâ A fire so searching, it should find Its way thro' the whole mass of Mind: Kindling it so Into an universal loving glow That man should live in his own light, And see, and know, and rule himself aright. The glorious sun, that swayed alone, While yet creation was a child, Is sovereign still upon his throne Undimmed, undarkened, undefiled. They watch and wheel, those mighty spheres, Still rushing round him at his will, Thro' boundless space, and countless years, And he doth list their music still. And ever, onward as they roll, He cheers them with his quickening rayâ Yes, they, the things without a soul Their darkness is redeemed to day. But the spirit's realm of night, Where's the sun should give it light? Where the spheres should circle round, When shall their sweet music sound? When shall rise the mighty one To frame this world in unison? Law and Freedom to atone Thro' his sway in Love alone: While around his radiant State, All beside shall watch and wait. Boldly arise And brightly shine! So shall the prize Be surely thine: Thou, our young creation's sire, Gifted with that thoro' fire. Other lights shall then be dim, Other wills shall wait on him, Other voices shall be mute, Other kings shall do him suit. But be whate'er he will That godly one must be a Poet still: Poet in his soul and heart Tho' he scorn the Rhymester's art, Tho' his eyes did never look On the letters of a book; His ears hearken, nor his tongue Utter such as bards have sung. Nor his fingers hold a penâ A Poet must he be, that monarch among men, With a spirit and an eye Beholding all things from on high, So in unity of soul Worldly fractions to make whole; Framing them to Truth anew, From his type of Godhead true. Not slumping in the downcast drudge's tramp, Nor watching coldly Theory's pale star-lamp, So blind and lame were helpless, each of each; But blending Will and Work, as Truth doth teach, From faithful Love, his genial Poet-sun, He doth Man's duty, and rejoiceth when 'tis done. He hath never walked among The turmoiling silly throng, Galling each his neighbour's heel, Seeing nought but what they feel: He ne'er wallowed with the press In the mire of worldliness: Never shrank from danger yet, Never feared his fellow's threat: Be it lord or be it king, Scornful of each selfish thing, One scope, and one alone, he deigns to scan The Church of Christ, the commonwealth of Man. Oh! well were such a mind Worthy to sway Mankind, If only they again Were worthy subjects of such sovereign. Alas! 'tis there Hope darkens to Despair! Tho' skilled the potter, and tho' clear the flame, Yet, if the clay be coarse, the vessel is the same. Strange as the music of the spheres To clownish dulness of our ears, Is that which the soul pours along On the Poet's tide of song. Hearts and ears are dead alikeâ What new string were best to strike? Oh, that art again were wild, Oh that Man were now a child, All enravelment undone, Then were Hope, where now is none: No, must fuse the bulk again Else our toil is all in vain. Melt each stubborn custom down, Sword and mitre, seal and crown: Till the mingled masses run Altogether into one. Till the dross be cleared away From its deadening surface sway. And what tho' his high hope Should sink in darkness ere she reach her scope? What tho' the upper air Be all too thin his essence to upbear? Then must he fallâ But shall he fail? And all that he hath done, is all Of no avail? Oh believe not what they say: Truth will live and find her way. Thousand times hath she been cross'd; Often miss'd, but never lost. Yes, in her travail she may droop awhile, But swift shall be her joy: And sweetly shall she smile Upon her new-born boyâ For that same Saviour must be born againâ And Christ revisit earth, thence evermore to reign. âBeshrew me,â said the host, entering then, And gazing full on his guest's countenance, âIf I would fit Rebellion with a head For this mad outbreak, head and heart of it, Thou art the manâfor thou hast fire in thee To catch men's souls: thine eye glows as 'twould set The world aflame: and when thou hast done that, And made a hell of what was earth before, That will be then thy heaven: but holdâread thisâ 'Tis from thy father; sage and scrupulous, E'en as the man himself. That fire of thine Prithee, whence hast thou it! Sure not from him. That talk is liker truth that rumours thee A foundling, what, didst never hear it? ah wellâ It is but random work done in the dark Where like begets not like. There look it o'erâ Haply thou can'st unriddle it. He asks Of Linsingen, whether he hold with us, Whom he affectsâhis wont of lifeâhis haunts, And whole behaviour: would have me keep The man in daily ken. How? is he mad? All this to me from him, who knows much more Than I can guessâand then he styles him tooâ What is it? CaptainâEnsign Linsingenâ A calling was ne'er hisâWhat, hath your sire Sat on these thoughts so long and restlessly Till he hath addled them? and memory Is blurred and blunt with many clashing cross Meanings, where one alone were clear enough? Is it so? or is there something in all this Of mystery, more than they can foot to the end Who know not what's before?â With a quick glance Hermann o'erran that letter, âHere I see More written than you told me even now, My father counsels you to leave our league: Guessing you likeâAh no! not like himself; But like some othersâripe to fall awayâ Ripe, aye, and rotten tooâwell, let them fall. What think you of the counsel?â âThou hast asked Freely, and freely I will answer thee. I think, nay more, I meanâto follow it: Taking the hint of a much wiser head To save my own; nor, howe'er sworn, will I dare More than man should: to send among the herd Such spirit, as can but madden them, to rush Adown the steep. Mischief like that, whoe'er Else wills, I nill it.â âWell, and if thou art A coward by compulsion of cold blood I quit thee; but a traitor is no need. Beware thenâfor thou riskest thy own life, Betraying ours.â Carelessly, as he spoke, So he rose too, without another word, And from that bright warm ingle strode again Into the night, unknowing whither next. But soon a soul like his, so keenly set, Cuts what no skill untwists. âWhere lies the coast?â Up to the stars he looked, and as he asked, Straightway they answered him. âWhat, are ye, too, Traitors? and dare ye then aid and abet My traitorous self, pointing my pathway out? Aye, but ye'll rue it: henceforth the justices Most loyal, will proclaim ye a curfew-tide To blout your lights. Else they'll withhold your due Warrant; must shine no more.â So desperate men Their desperation wreathe with crazy mirth, Myrtling the sword: and so on madman lips Bubbles the foamâbetokening wild work That gares within. He stretched his stiffen'd arms, A lunge or twoâfastened his coat to the chin, Then on with swelling breast and spirit as high As that most dismal night were his bridal morn, And he bound to the church. So a lone hour, O'er hill and waste, morass, gully and moor, He filled with those birth thoughts, dark hinted oft Before and uncared, now more clear to him: Welcomer yet than clear. Until at last Nature began to seek her due of him, For she would wait no longer. All the world Beside, she held in her soft hold of sleep, And outleave he hath none. He flung him down On a hill, midway between the nether damp And the cold weathery ridgeâhis bosom books Pillowed his headâthe Bibleâand next in worth, The stoic Emperor's thoughts, and to relight His spirit's glow, when fainting, with their own, Milton's Defence, and AeschylusââThou kind Earth, Thou Mother Nature, whom I've loved so long, At least I am no rebel against thee, Thou'lt shelter me:â he said, and nestled there, And slept, and dreamtâno idle dreamâbut strange As the other circumstance of that wild sleep. He saw a meteor, or what so seemed, Shoot down the sky, greater as nearer it grew. Till it stood before him, awful to behold, An angel fresh from Heaven. âI come to thee, Bringing the tidings of what God ordains, And thou must do: forbear all question, But hearken faithfully what truly I tell. There are full many whom thou fain would'st see, But go not near to themâand there are some Thou hast ne'er known, whom God, a trusty guide Shall lead thee. Go then, visit them assured, And what the spirit prompts thee, speak that same. For the rest, as He wills, so it will be done. Take thou no thought of it.â The angel spake And vanished, but his presence left in the air And the hearer's sense such a sweet influence. That Hermann slumber'd on, a heavenly trance, Was never sleep so sweet; and heavenly E'en as that trance so was the freshness too Wherein he rose from it, buoyant and light As the mountain airâlusty of heart and hope, Like yonder sun now risen brightly up To light the livingâin such spirit he rose And prayedââI thank thy goodness, Father and God, In whom and by whose grace I am what I am, For all thy blessingsâchiefly for this sign Thou hast vouchsafed me.â A minute more, he stood Upon the crest of that high beetling cliff Sublime o'er boundless ocean. Such a look As beggared all magnificence behind Spread for the eye by Nature. There he stood As a vassal, suddenly and in surprise Encountering the front of majesty, Speechless with awe, till thus his soul o'erflowed. âA stately queen is Nature, But e'en her mightiest stature In wood and wild is dwarfed by thee Thou endless wonder, thou huge Sea! Yes, shamed by thy old hoary Dominion is Earth's glory. I seemed erewhile a man of mightâ But nowâI'm nothing in thy sight. And lo! thy foam is flashing, And thy huge billows dashing: And yet art thou, the vast, the wild, To thy stern Father a meek child. Thou seek'st not to be greater Than Himâthan thy Creator. But I, a weak and helpless thing, Will know no law and own no king. I call theeâbut thou carest Nought of the voice thou hearest. I may not bend thee to my will, Yet would I rule a fiercer still. Yes thou inhuman ocean Fiercer than thy commotion, And wilder and more hard to tame Is that folk-sea, that flood of flame. Who fares that sea must rue it And yet I would subdue it That lawless one, so fierce and strong, And what I would I will ere long. But thouâthou dost inherit A free and mighty spirit Untired, untainted, to the end. Wilt burst thy bounds and be my friend? Man's lordship was ne'er o'er thee, Therefore I kneel before thee. Come, as of yore, come flooding in, We two will purge this world of sin! Alas! thy high-sould seeming Is but fond Fancy's dreaming; Roll and roar onâthou'rt no ally Old Ocean, for such things as I. And yet, how fair thy level deep communion! So might we frame Mankind to Christian unionâ Yesâup and onwardâto make Man as free As thou hast ever been, thou glorious Sea!â He spake, and mused awhile; then merrily Adown the hill, toward the fisher huts, There by the coast: when, as the level he reached, He came to a slight path crossing his line Eastward and westâ'twas strange to him: but yet Some power that he knew not whence it was, O'erruled him from his purpose to go on And turned him thither aside. He followed it, Unwittingly, but yet undoubting too, As in a dream: till he beheld a house Of fanciful adornment, airy and light, New-fangling our forefathers' Gothic old Earnestness, mighty arch, tower, battlement With tinsel trickery; laceman's mimicry, Stone-shamming, mud-built fripperyâthat house Gave him the hint and token what to say, For he bethought him who its inmates were; He cross'd the threshhold: âEdward Linsingen,â After some courteous preface, thus he spake To her who came to meet him from within, Young, fair, but for her frailty's forfeiture, Is of this household? âYes, Sir,â a deep blush Vouching her words, âwhat would'st thou toward him?â âI wouldâwellâI'm his friend, no truer oneâ And thine no lessâfor thy faith's sake to him. Now listen, for my counsel imports bothâ Both him and thee: he was betrothed years back Thou know'st it and her tooâhis kindred now Would have him marry her. Yes, painful it is And pitiful; but who would heal a wound Must handle it first. Now would'st thou ward away This deadly mischief from thy heart and home, (As, doubtless, thou art earnest in that will) I'll show thee means: how to keep all as sure Thy hope, thy love, all thy whole life in him, As else thou'lt lose it. We've an enterprise Myself and other thousands of my mind, Which if he undertake his share of it He's barred forthwith, wholly, relentlessly, From his kindredâmeeting nor e'en message moreâ From all but theeâand thenââ She gazed on him Looking her eager soul forth in her gaze, Till tears suffused her sight: then what she felt Sudden she broke his speech with it, her sobs Struggling against her words. âOh Sir, a friendâ None e'er comes now to cheer my lonelinessâ Thy kindnessâshown so seldomâis kinder felt. Yet must I tell thee, I deserve it not. For, Sir, 'tis true, I've walked in perilous ways, Till what was peril is guilt: and yet, methinks, If sufferance may atone for our past sins, More than I've sinned I've suffered. Many are they Who scorn meâmy friends once; cousinsâand oh, 'Tis sad to utter it, my sisters tooâ Bear it I must from them, but how from him? Noânot from him. Yes, Sir, of those I know, One only loves meâand think, Sir, what I were Should that one leave me to their hate and scorn, Outcast. No, I would dieâbetter before Than afterâbut thy wordsâthere is yet hopeâ For he's a loving heartâfond as my ownâ And no less trueâthen tell me, Sir, tell all, And doubt me not, lest I should shrink from it. Forgive me, I've a heart, and feelings long Unwontedânow, befriended once againâ Burst forthâfor thou dost speak as one who hath A gentle heart to feel for me, instead Of a bitter tongue to make me feel myself. Then tell me, for thus lingeringââ What she would Further than this, she uttered it in tears. (After a few more hopeful hints from him) Of purest passion: but they flowed not long: Soon was her anguish comforted to joy, For what he told; how that her lover e'en now (As Zimmermann had made it manifest) Stood in misprision, with unfriendly eyes Watching him: wherefore boldest play was like To be his best, and onward, safer and sage Than to fall back. This and much tidings more All to one end, awakening love by turns, And fear, she heard and did embosom it, Glad rapture; for when two desires would rush With warm encounter, each in the other's arms, Needs not much argument to drive them on, Their meeting is soon made. They were agreed, Ere their agreement could be said in words, By their commutual will. Strangers they met, And parted in full trust, as inmost friends. BOOK XII. Union, if e'er thy name should mean a truth, How happy were the nations in that name, How free! I wonder much that in slave-lands The censor's pen should leave the word in print Uncancell'd: raising by its utterance Such threatening thoughtsâfor if in thy full strength As men invoke thee, so thou wouldst stand up, By Heaven, ere thou wert risen half thy height Tyrants would fling them prostrate on their face Before theeâscared into a most sage fear At sight so startling. Monarchy 'gainst thee What is it but one straw standing aloof Against the stack? Were I a kingânay, that Is not all evilâbut a wolf-king, as some, Thy whisper'd name would fright me more than din Of thunder in my ears; I should so shrink To hear it, as at sight of a sudden knife On upstart slumber gleaming at my throat. But now thy name is allâa shadowy name, No moreâyet haply, while it lives, or seemsâ That shadow may portend a substance too, Idle portent unreal. Men play with words As boys with bubbles; and so blowing out A full round word, think it a glorious thing, And are content with it: counters for coin: But where those counters are, the coin is not; And who wins most is the unluckiest; Fool's wagesâUnion, thou art a fair word, And rife in many mouths; but thou fill'st not The manly hunger that craves other food Than windâaway with itâperish the phrase, When that were perished a clear void would be, And then would men haply bestir themselves To fill it up with deeds. Why! what strange dolts Are we all, we busy bodies of this earth Struggling, yet overlooking our only means To make us mighty! We are as elements Each by itself foredoomed to barrenness Till all be blent togetherâUnion in them Is fruitful nature, and in us no less. Clay, sand, chalk, mixed with mould. But oh thou Man! Thou fool! That what we endure of general grief Each of us all should mutter his sense of it In his own breast! when fellow-utterance Would swell the fellow-outbreak to a storm, Such storm as they who will not bow to it Must break before it. Oh most froward choice! Choosing to sigh despairingly alone Than shout triumphantly as patriots should A bold conspiring shout. But we, ah noâ The might of such an Union was ne'er ours, Else had misrule been blown away by it As cobwebs from the trumpet, when its breath Is louded blasted: thoro' 'twas ne'er yet. And till it come, our weal must wait for it, Haply so long, till Manhood pine away To that poor thing called Patienceâa dull sheep Sheared many times, and slaughter'd last of all In silly sufferance. Would they look round The many might learn wisdom of the few Truly to bind themselves for their own good E'en as their rulers do; for 'tis that ring Doth make these men within it drivers, and those Without it burden-bearers: makes them so And keeps them; when it fails, lordship fails too, Signally. In such danger, then, were they Those lordly leaders, there in Gilnau met, How best boldly, yet wary, to win way Out of their peril. Thither their best power Was drawn together; and all little enough If number were the only rate of worth For such encounterâbut the warrior-sword Hath more decision than a score clown-scythes, Cumbrous, tho' big, and wielded cumbrously: E'en in such surety they stood hitherto 'Gainst their ungainly foes: no fear of the end But only lest that end be far to seek For lack of a clear issue, and fair field To fight it outâbut later tidings now Weakened their trust. Seldorf and Falkenstein, Arenberg, Altheim, Bruhl, and Geisingen The chief 'mong many others of less note Met there to raise the mouldering standard up Of lordly Law, and selfish wilfulness; To crush Rebellion's head, and drag in dust Its senseless body at their cannon wheels; And there they now held council. Not as late With overweening wrath; but doubtfully, In earnest doubt, for many flying clouds Had gather'd to one body, thick and dark O'ershadowing the late cheer of hopefulness Most gloomily: and Fame's latest report Of ill was overlaid, ere an hour gone, With something worse. Who rubbed their hands in glee May wring them in grief. Behoved them all their strength In such a strait as this, and all their skill To make strength sure. Fearfully were they met, And Distrust crept, a haggard mutterer, Thro' that old Justice Hall. Each man of them Sought comfort from his neighbour's countenance And found but fear. âHow now? thy brow is dark, Thine, and all others here: haggard thy gaze; Sure some unearthly mischievous portent. Look roundâwhat anxious strange alarm is this That like the stern sway of a thunder-cloud O'erawes us?â a dark dreamâand the truth of it Yet darker. Thus they feltânor knew their doom So feeling it: for the stern spirit o'erhead, Watching his hour, the avenger of Man's wrong, They knew him not. Else, 'stead of dumb dismay, They had shrieked out at the sightâfor look on him, His arm is bared, and but one moment more From darkness he bursts forth in a hurricane And they, all thunderstricken by his bolt, In wild tumultuous maddening agony, Where shall we hide us? At last, in the eager throng Dismay composed itself to audience And Arenberg rose up. Governor late Of this same province, till War snatched from him His peaceful rule, o'erbearing Law with its will, Making its sword the sceptre. âSirs, we are here,â So said the calm and worshipful old man, âUpholders of our lawful authority Against this uproar. Whether to keep off Rebellion, at sword's length, till it be slain, Or else vouchsafe them terms: now, what we would If our wills wielded it offhand, none doubts 'Tis nothing short of flat submission first And then the headsman and the hangman's work To follow after. That is easy said, And haply, many here will say no less Many and brave menâI mistrust them not But he's yet braver who in the hot field Will vouch the sayingâ'tis a dangerous proof I say it steadfastly: most dangerous As full of danger as the bravest here Is full of daring to encounter it This outbreak is no bubbleâa week's growth And now already a giant. This, I trow Is our third day abiding here on watch And needs but such a fourth to end us all. Tidings are traitors, and blow Treason abroad Blasting us with each breath. Stolberg is kept In rebel hold, despite our utmost strength Shivered against itâour worst brunt they bore And beat it backâsix score men lost to us Worse yet, the devil hath sown tares thro' our best Wheat, our own hands and arms against us turned Young Linsingen, beshrew the silliness That left him with such means of mischief there Only to help his rebel brother's ends Ere the assault, he and a hundred more Took Treason's sideâfrankly went o'er to them And fought so madly against us as they fight Who from defeat to death have but one step, And knowing that, are fain rather to die In wilful proud defiance of the Law Than by its doom. Then what ye've heard, how one Half-crazy cobbler, weapon'd but with knife And pistols, slew seven soldiers, ere they took His hut, with his life tooâand this for proof As he harangued his fellows ere the feat That householder o'er soldier hath the odds, If will to use them. Hideous this, but true, And what seems safe, stands in scarce better plight Than that clear lossâso spreads the black blood-drop From the heart thro'. For I have tidings sure That the more half of those who bide behind Stay but on tip-toe; and those upbreakers Have better right than we to call them theirs Having the heart and soul of the whole bulk Upon their side. Thus is our keystone gone Dragging our main dependence after it Ruining down on us; and all that's left A show, no surety. Now, Sirs what to do, That must your wisdom settle and work out But suddenly; for in such din, such crash Thundering in our ears, a minute's loss May become everlasting death to us, Then let each shortly speak his seeming out, And mine is this. For war, we're weaker far Than warrants it. Our strength is rottenness, Our army falling off from us like flesh In a feverâto us hollow and hireling-like But native in heart-yearning to our foes, A wolf less true to its keeper than its kind Wilder than safe: long reared and fed by us But for a rank and idle outlay in peace In war a deadly home-thrust treachery Betrayed, by whose sworn faith we trusted most This for our soldieryâa hope, by the wise Long seen but for suspicion, and which now The simplest is unfooled of itâwhat yet Stands, tho' ill-propped, our power, wealth, patronage These were strong means when all things else were ours Before these broils begun, this devil loosed But nowâthey're but the golden harvestage Against the whirlwind flame; feeding its wild Foe, whom withstand it cannot nor yet flee My lordsâthis sudden onflash of rock-oil How quell it? we must try, being so weak Some other trial than War's bloody work Lest so our weakness fail before their strength And then we stand forlornâbare poles in the boat Hands ugly, rigging lost. Now we've no means But friendly composition and fair terms To help us to that end. The world is gone After themâold things pastâall become new; Therefore the proffered peace we flung from us In scorn, when pride of power prompted us As regret vails not to recover it So neither will I now spite the old sore Handling it o'er again: only mark this If ye would treaty rather than sharp war, Surety than utter downfal, then be warned: Bid liberal and largely, gainliest so Else cheapening and haggling ye but give Time for the tide to o'erreach us, and betray Alike our fears and niggard narrowness Paltering them with shamsâwith a beggar's dole From the high-heaped wealth, which in plain truth ye hold As by their toil, so at their mercy too Poor and precariousâaye, 'tis salt truth But we must swallow it: and I be sure As loathingly as any of ye all But what needs must, why, 'tis best gulped at once Sour medicine we but embitter more With our sour looksâtherefore our polity Boldly and without drawbackâhear me ye shall Be it the scapegoat of our property And let the people freely take their turn To rule us, as they must, despite of us And so shall Allman's will be Allman's law Better and safer, whatsoe'er befal Than Allman's violence. Our lordly sway Of birthright, burdensome, but gainful, no E'en as a mantle of state, we must fling off And meet them hand with hand, and man with man Lest if we strive to keep it, shirt and skin Be torn away with it: and the harsh tax Whereby we now dishearten toil's hard bread Frankly we must forego it. Church and State Must be reformed to such a rule of Right As squares with Reason: and in sacred things No charge imposed, pain nor privation 'Gainst conscious choice; but where each man approves There let him pay. More I might show to ye But this till then: and thus I see some hope Foregoing much to save more that remains Sleepening their fire with sunbeamsâbut let none Mistake, that yielding thus, we yield to the axe The handle, whence to smite us, root and branch, Nayâmy good friendsâif they be minded so They've means already to fulfil their mind Being thousands to one. So, if they're bent To rob us, why, 'tis sure we must be robbed But to hold parley with them in such wise Makes them no stronger robbers than before, And I have trustworthy intelligence That there are many 'mong them will fall off For such fair promise: lessening their force And swelling ours. Else if we stand for all We hold, tho' much of it, like a yule-log In Midsummer, a clumsy stumbling-block Useless to us, to them a sore offence, Then were we swept sheer off.â He ceased, for wrath Ruffled his hearers, and unwilling spite To hearken; as when Severn, eddying down By towering Berkley, embrued with kingly blood Suddenly, 'gainst south western wind and tide Dashes itself to foam, and high uprears Its billowy crestâso his mild wisdom chafed Their reckless will. This Ludwig sawâa shrill Sharp, most shrewd lawyer. âSir, the Governor Says to us, gulp my physicâa dose perhaps Of saltsâwell that were not so muchâbut no He'd have us drink the whole salt seaâthat's hard To do; were drowned downright, goods, lands, and all Ere our first draught: but there are ways and means We need not take the open broad high road Nor show our gameâfar better throw some sham Tub to the wallowing unwieldy whale That tempests now our oceanâgive 'em then Their Universal Suffrage, the whole hog Sow, pigs, and all: needs not much nicety Men, women, children too: for all that can Duly and solemnly prove the child's ripe Discretion, pick the plums from the bread cake And from 'mong marbles snatch the lollipopâ And give each workman too a double vote One 'gainst himself and fellows, one for us Nayânever fearâwe'll give it, yet keep back, Keep in our hands the ballot-box: receive All votes with most religious reverence And with full faithâin our judicious selvesâ Report them, how we will: that's pleasant and fair, They the vote-dreamers, we the interpreters; Then throw them that big tub; some others too Smaller onesâbut to hold allâhope it not. Ye know the boy's tale of some twenty men Wrecked on a desert isle: two lords, the rest Workmen. At break of day, âwork, said the two, We cannot, ought not, will not. Now, as then, You must work for us.â So they didâfed, lodged, Clothed 'emâbut needful livelihood thus foreseen, Then all took council for the general rule. But noâyou workmen are no councillors: 'Tis ours to rule, yours to obey: so spake The lordlings; but the craftsmen? noâand thence So severed, the whole rope ran backâmust start All from one level line, each for himself, Win bread or starveâthey grasped o'ermuch, those two, So will not we, if wise.â Trueâbut these men Are but self-wiseâupstarted Falkenstein Hasty and moody, in scornful lordliness; Haughty of behaviour even as of soul; Noble, yet abler than nobility's wont; And deeming of that fond o'erweening dream As of some high and holy mystery Faithfully to be worshipped, and no word Of whence or wherefore. Outwardly withal Bounteous; scattering largess with free hand; As feeling, that the giver is glorified And he who takes beholden unto him In bounden duty: and so all he gave It was brought back and laid before his feet In such a shape as truly his pride loved More than its pelfish one: worshipful words, And lowliness and whispered deference: For gold to him was dirt; trade-stamped; shop-trash; He scorned and therefore gave it. Long had he marked And with high-towering fierce disdainfulness, How sturdily the craftsmen challenged him And his compeers to prove their privilege In rightful warrant: setting the Truth up Against fantastic old Idolatry; Thronging in lewdly and with prying points Proving the stately fabrication's self, That none ahould search too close, but fall flat down And worship it. A wrathful man was he To hear their hopes, much more see their success Upstarting. âGentlemen,â thus fiercely he spake, âIf yet distinction be 'tween gentle and churl, Which some would seem to doubt: and in all faith As they doubt us, frankly, I doubt them too That they are bastardâfor sure, noble blood Would ne'er so shame itselfânobles in name, Addelheads only. We have heard what I Had sooner torn my tongue up by the roots Than uttered it: and so I trust would ye Whoe'er is not a traitor. Here's a flood Of mire, of filthy muck scouring this land; And we are asked, will we bestir ourselves To keep it out, or must we give it room To smother field and home, all that is ours, E'en to our halls, our hearths, our very beds, With swinish sewerageâyet moreâshall we along To swell its streamâwe nobles! to float down Upon it, lazy as scum, foul as dead dogs, Till sunk low under it at last! Why, when Did insolence, howe'er bloated of late, Did it e'er dream foreafterly like this, Which statemanship, oh shame to call it so, Would now uphold for Truth. Oh yesâfor Truth Herself, once rabbled, becomes rabble-like, Fouled with her handler's filth. To reason it I will not: but would fling all reason away Sooner than give the thought room in my mind, Tho' but to prove it wicked as 'tis false, Wilder, than needs wisdom to argue it. What, shall we do any the dirtiest deed That e'er polluted earth? Eat our own sires Rather than bury them? give to the arms Of some strong hilding churl for his strength's sake Our dainty daughters? These and the like things Doubtless keen wits, scornful of the wiser world Might quibble us why: for waive Nature away, Nature by knaves and dolts called prejudice, With pale Philosophy outwrangling her, They may be holden usefulâyet the man Were a cur, an ape, to trust themâfor all talk Where inborn feeling loathes and starts from it Is shame confess'd. Therefore to argue this Were baser than to measure swords with a thief In question of our honour. What! is here Any so craven of heart, but his blood boils, Tho' but to think such terms? for my own, Sirs, I'll spill it on the dust to the last drop Ere I will hearken them. Rather a dog Than such a nobleman. Then what needs more? Say this king Lud and his brutish followers Have Reasonâwellâtheir own is good for them: Like their mud-hutsâmay dabble both alike With dirty craft. But weâwe'll keep to ours, In theirs we enter not. Pride, say ye so? Well thenâwe'll show cause: that stiff underclay You'd turn it uppermost. Noâas subsoil, It gives our tillage a strong wholesome stand. But the land's life and growth you stifle at once, Bringing it on the surface. Howe'er, for us, Gentlemen, all we would is hold our own: And that we can and will. When I must yield My castle and broad lands, my ancestral Vessels, silver and gold, my shield, my coat, The very shirt I wear for boorish backs, To prank them just so sagely as the ape Its pilfer'd garment; then, too, will I bate The slightest tittle of my privilege. No bugbear till such time shall fright me so But I will hold them fast as my soul's faith; And they who'd take them must fight hard for them, To outfight me. Why, Sirs, our forefathers Had scorned to back a foot, tho' for their lives, From such a rabble; at the first onset Had broken them, and then bruised them to bits, For rotten stuff; and all they doubted of Had been but this; the lustre of our swords, Shall we so stoop to dim it with base blood Instead of rope and cudgel? Oh let us But dare so much as manfully do that Which they did scornfullyâto arm and fight, Unless they flee us first, as like they will Halfway; however, down with them I say, Down with the bristling upstarts: as I rend, Scatter and trample in dust this their broadsheet So will we them as surely.â Boldly he spoke, A boldness that caught many hearts beside, Doubtful and cold before: and their new warmth Grew next to fiery heat; for, while he spoke All travel-toiled a messenger came in Bearing glad news. Rebellion had been checked: The tower of Mittenwald with arms full stored, Had Weyer, hottest head of the rebel host, And bloodiest hand, with a band tumultuous Stirred by himself to the feat, attacked and won; Won and then lost it with his own life too, Slain there outright: and other men of mark His fellows in that plot had rued it alike, Sharing his death. Needs but a child's hand-shove To shift the floating vessel; and their minds Erewhile reeling unsteady to and fro Caught that light breath and spread all sail to it, So by the fickle favour of its hope Steering amain further than eye could see Across the unfathom'd ocean. Strong emprize, Feeble assurance! but Hope soars or sinks Bursting into a blaze, or dying away From slightest kindling cause, if fuel it find: And they from any catchword would take fire As straws from a spark. Then hurried eagerness Was rife, and greetings glad, and hasty scorn Foresnatching the main upshot of the wheel From one slight turn. Swiftly the word went forth To strike at once home to Rebellion's heart, Stunned, as likely it would, or much dismayed By such strong blow. With trumpet then and drum Was Peace noised off, from pleading her mild prayer; Then loud and ceaseless stirring was the din Of bloody preparation: revelry Swilling the streetsâbanners aflaunt in air, All scamps, shacks, blackguards, noble warriors now, Outrageous license beckoned to come in, And fill with uproar the scant time between, Lest Conscience should grow cool, and thoughtfulness E'en in those reckless souls turn into doubt Which side were better, challenging free choice Instead of helpless blindfold slavery. Then all was soldiership, e'en to the games Of aping childrenâand the heavy huge Unwieldy bulk of war framed in array, To move at instant need: nor only here Did the hurtling Giant rise, and blow his blast And bare his murderous arm. Treason and War Are many-handed monsters, and their works Manifoldâstriking with their thunder-stroke Countries, and seas, and cities far between, And all at once. While here hurry was rife, And Hermann afar off, on the wild coast Stirred up the dwellers there, desperate men, To a venture yet more desperate than their wont; While so he fared, his father sate the while In depth of a dark night; fearfully sate, Brow bent toward brow, with Seldorf, that proud Count: Of all the country around, and of that huge Grey abbey-pile wherein they met, the lord And landowner. 'Twas a confessional, Where they held conclave; or had beenânow books Did the priest's duty and fulfilled his room, Shelved round the walls, dark wainscoted and carved With quaintest skill: and the huge oaken-door Slow creaking, opened thence into a high Arched hall; the Abbey Chapel aforetime For the old Faith. They had outwatched the stars: And the dark low-toned danger of their talk With shadow of the doom awaiting them Deepened the midnight gloom. Sure, such a cause, Whether to stand or fall, and by what means, Is deep deliberation: and the old man Being a traitor, would seem something else, And therefore needed many a round of words To cloak his purposes: fold upon fold As on a deep-coiled mummy, and nought at last But filth and stench within. Long glozing he spake Ere thus he ended. âSir, what I have said Be sure of it; much mischief hath he wrought; And will much more; 'less he be timely stopp'd, Nay, clean cut off: 'Twas he in Salfeld there Having by night thither adventured him, Stirred up his brother to take traitor arms Himself, and his men with him, one and all, Whence Stolberg, you well know, was lost. Now, Sir, To rid him off outright, him your worst fear, Hearken me how. The bridal is this morn, This very morn; for look, by yonder clock We are past midnight, and the way he comes Is alike sure as his coming certainty. But for myself, my tidings too, tho' high Their worth, I ask no hireâonly thus muchâ The game I start, to see ye hunt it thro'. So shall Rebellion stagger, and one stroke Smiting it as it reels, shall smite it down: And the State, shaken by this wild earthquake, Shall stand thence steadfastâfor me, Conscience alone Is here concerned. If so atone I may Truly and well, what I've been ill beguiled That is my richest hope. For the rest, Sir, E'en to your hands I do commit myself To weigh my present worth against my past, And thenâif this my zeal seem worthy of thanks Or free forgiveness, or yet further grace, To give it.â So he spake, and parted so Homeward; in tremulous hurry traversing The night: as who hopes to escape his cares Out-speeding themâfond hopeâfor the hell-hounds Track not their game behind, but ravin the heart Within. He hasted onâstill onâvain haste! Then stopp'd. That moment from his brooding thoughts Upgrew a monstrous horror, awful, hugeâ Beyond the boldest Manhood its huge awe. His Conscienceâin fiend-shape confess'd to him, Leering and jeeringâharrowing his soul Hellishlyâfront to front, as at doomsday Bodily. To dissemble then was not: But in the shade of its dark presence, down He fell, bowed down, a deadly agony, Speechless confession: such as Sin needs must Arraigned to final doom. Oh! then all worlds Millions and millions he would give them all, Unhappy man, of his remorse late rued! For when did ever the fiend quit his prey Once seized?âsudden he fellâfor the evil ghost So with the thundering terror of his voice Smote him, that all his senses darkly reeled, Whirled his wild eye-ballsâthen, with lightning stroke Branded him thro' the forehead to the brain Deep blasted. He shrieked out and started away Wringing his hands, and laughing as he ran Yet crazier than his shrieksâhedge o'er, ditch thro' Straight to his door. His daughter open'd it And saw a maniac gnashing his teeth. âFather, is't thou? what's this?â Nay, ask not him: 'Tis vain. That night pass'd off, and the sun rose Early, to climb his high midsummer hill; But Linsingen in loving earnestness Made him a laggardâspringing up himself The brighter and more gladsome of the two: Ere yet that fiery eyeball overpeered Above the sky-line. Whither he would go He told to none, lest some should construe him More softly than befitted that stern time: Mistrusting him, lest his red warlike star Should fade in Love's faint lustre. As he rose, Loud howled the warning wind. âAye, howl away And drive the cowering sheep for shelter there Beneath yon ridge. I like the augury: To those who now are drooping, our dear foes, Foreboding dread; to us, the Conquerors, A glad heart-glow: for we will sweep this land With a strength mighty as thine.â So he went on, Stout in self-will, a bridegroom, hopeful and bright, Saying no word, taking no friendly leave, As minding to return thither that day A faithful husbandâso insuring her Ere he outrisked himself. 'Twas a weary length Of walk, twelve mountain miles over the moors That lay before him: but his heart was there Earlier than himself, and drew him on, By threads unseen, yet strong as adamant, No sense of toil. But foemen were abroad: And tho' his blood were hot, and his spirit high, He deemed them, that day, better left aside Than to confront them. In that thought he left The beaten road, and o'er the hills away To others all unwonted, but to him Ranging for game, tho' trackless, often tried: No fear of ambush there, but open and clear As ocean. In that trust forward he went Like a brave boat in storm, up the ascent Down the steep fallâforward so far, until From a lone crag, oh, welcome! 'tis the Church, Where he should be a bridegroom that same morn, And Lucy a bride. He stood and gazed on it As on Heaven's gates: rested refreshfully, Still gazingâthen arose, and looking round, âBy Heaven, that very moor I tried for game Some three years since: and but for walking it And shooting one poor hare, they robbed me at Law, More than the land's worth: but now times are changed: And there I'll range, and none shall hinder me. The Freedom that I fight for, its first fruits I challengeâcan thence take the roadâno fear For that short distance.â Hold, thou rashness, hold, Act not thy deadly words. Meanwhile that house In bridal hope, yet not quite fearlessly, Awaited him, and filled the growing gap With dismal pale forebodingsâfelt the more At the heart, since driven thither from the face Which, with semblance of ease and gladsome show Would fain belie it. Still as the hours waned So waxed their gloom within; till doubt on doubt Grew unto darkness: then a flash of light Showing that darkness deeper than before, And dreader. Hurried in their trusty old Walter, would draw his master thence aside: But as he entered, and each eager eye Inquired of him, his faculty fell short To answer falsely what too truly he knew: And so, missing his purpose he looked round Wildly, till e'en that wildness lost itself Confounded wholly in tears. âWhy, what is this? Walter, how now? something befallen ill? But hither, come this way.â So the sire spake, But she, his earnest daughter, undismay'd Whate'er it be, speak out, evil or good, I will know all. âAye, truly, so you must: For such a mischief, hide it we can not As one would smother a sparkâyes, you must know, But not from meâso kind as thou hast beenâ Would sooner die than tell thee. And Sir, indeed,â Thus he half said, half sobbed in her father's ear, â'Tis deathâthey've taken himâthere's one killed dead, But the rest took him there by the moor-side, And so away with him. Hans saw it all. But weâhow yet to help him?â To the tongue Wormwood, and evil tidings to the ear Are of sharp proof; swift striking on the sense And biding there. Lucy heard all, tho' meant Aloof from her. She heard and swooned away, A deadly swoon: for she had nerved herself To encounter all of Fate she could foresee Standing abreast against her; but this chance Befel her so, with onset so athwart, It shocked her from her stand. When thence again Being raised, and in her chamber sadly laid, She gathered up her soul from that surprise; Then all her mourning friends, mother and all, She prayed them to go forth, and leave her awhile Alone in sorrow: they, tho' doubtfully, Their bidding did: speechless and shadowy Passing away from her: then in their place Her thoughts thronged in, a visionary train. âYes, the blow is strickenâthe death-blowâ Noble lovers ye are both laid low: No hope for ye. I alone, the traitress, yes e'en I, Who suborned ye most unwomanly, Why spare they me? Thou art powerful, but just, oh no Thou high Providence that orderest so! Nayâpeace, vain foolâ Worse than thousand deaths from headsman's steel Is the lifelong anguish I shall feel, And righteous is God's rule. I shall rue it in sore penitence, Yet 'twas done in truthful innocence And holiness. Work more pure was never wrought by men, So I thought and felt and knew it then And now no less. Aye and sure this is no punishment, But a trial of my true intent To stand or fall; Welcome thou strong trial! all I see Of thy terrors shall but strengthen me To brave them all. Hence weak pillow, hence despondency, 'Tis not weeping will avail with me, I must away. Thus I rise never again to rest Till his deadly danger be redress'd, My Faithâbe thou my stay.â Behind the hills of Engthal the sun sank Like some old empire, with more gorgeousness Cloaking his dwindled glory, âHe looks on thee Yes, sure he does, with his pale death-doomed look, And still thou shinest, heedless of the woe That thou dost witness. Thou art high and great But hast no feeling. Oh, go down, go down, I hate thee for thy brightness. Dost shine yet? Well, if thou wilt, I'll shut my eyes and weep Let others look on thee.â It was the voice Of a lone wandering girl, of Lucy Hess, Lone but for strength of soul: sore travelled, sad, Sitting on that heath-rock. For when she rose From the bed where they had left her, sobbing alone, So she went forth, unheeded of all there, Leaving no sign behind but a scant scrawl To show her meaning. Boldly she sped on, Bold in the surety of her faithfulness And purposed good. From an old crone, crutch-propp'd, Homewending with her burden of dry wood She learnt them, whither away: for Engthal straight: And having learnt so much, thither she too Hasted her weary walkâbeyond such girl To win so farâbut will is might. It braced Her slight soft frame harder and stronger'n steel, More careless of rough ways and thorns and stones Than the gipsy's horny foot. So, ere nightfall She stood, with an old higgler by her side Before the prison gate. âThis maiden here,â So spake her guide, as the wicket at his peal Was opened, âShe comes hither from afar: And she's betrothed to him ye have in holdâ To Linsingenâfain would she speak with him Unless such sad leave be forbidden yeâ For meâI know her, and warrant what she says, My wordâlife too, if needed.â The man heard Dangling his heavy keys, and eyed her askance Doubtfully, as she stood contemplating With deep heart-shudder there before the gate A ghastly stiff death-boding skeleton, The scaffold. But the speaker with those words Slipp'd silver in his hand, a fair broad crown, To pay their passage home. âWhat I can do I willâI'm but an underling. All's oneâ Must get the order. Wait outside awhileâ I will go see.â He went, and came again, âCome in; no other warrant than your word Is needed.â She stepp'd inwardâall was dark As 'twere a hundred fathom underground: Still as earth's centre, and seemed all as hard To win the outway. Clung the chilly damp About her cloak, and every breath she drew Seemed a choke fogâonward and onward, thro' Round within round of walls; such as but one Looked a more bulky barrier than need was: And still the little lamp they brought with them Showed slighter as they threaded each dim door Booming behind; till at the mid-hold stopp'dâ Each at the other sadly looked her thoughts, Too sad for speech. â'Tis hereâis it not here?â âAye, sure. Well thenâyou see me what I am, And know what I would haveâa poor lone girl: And now vouchsafe me with him a short while Aloneâthanks for thy kindnessââwith her speech For oversway she threw a small gold coin Into the balance. âWell, if so it mustâ Loversâ'twere hardâto grudge them their last hope: There is your way, but mark me, time is short, I'll wait outside.â The door opened and closed; And she pass'd on, treading so noiselessly That of her footfall the stones whispered not No more than of her thoughtsâsudden she stood And looked and sawâin the far corner there A light, and by that light a musing man: Deep musing, careless of whate'er might come As know ng well to-morrow must end all. And so he sate, his limbs and body cramped With his sore wounds, his head weighed on his hand Despondingly. She stood and gazed on him; For a still shiver crept upon her soul And speech. Then in hoarse catches, âLinsingen, Thy light is flaring out, it wastes apace, Look to it.â He sprang up at that sweet voice And in her arms. âLucy, dear love, is't thou? Oh, yes, none other than so kind a soul Had come to see meâa traitorâa rebelâyet thine, Thine ownâif but these chains. Well, is't not sad? There, in sight of the church, to be so met When I looked only for thy own sweet smile And such a meeting. And thou too so near And yet know nothing. Nay, thou hast heard all: And thy poor mother who shall comfort her? Oh, 'tis a selfish joy to see thee here At her worst need.â âTrue, 'tis indeed most sadâ My husband, yes my husband, thou'rt no less. For 'tis no sudden chance that can bereave Our holy purpose of its holiness. And I'm thy wife; thy own true earnest wife: And being so, fain would I grieve for thee As a wife shouldâso withering a grief My heart shrinks in with it. But I must not, Now is no time for tearsâFrank, I am here Not to weep with thee, but to rescue thee: Unless thy heart be weaker than a girl To strike for it. Thou knowest well, our hope Rests wholly upon thee; and in thy deathâ (Ah me! forgive me, uttering that word, But I feel something gives my soul the strength) Were all undone. But a minuteâwe've no moreâ Yet time enough. Strip thy apparel off See, 'tis soon sped. Mark me, I've done't e'en now; Thy coat and hat, and whate'er needs beside, And take this cloak of mine and my head-gear And what thou can'st wear elseâoh doubt not now But do it. A moment's doubt is death to thee An everlasting death.â âLucy, art mad? Sure 'tis dreadful to die, so young, so rich, So bless'd in all of worldly blessedness, But such a hope as thisâwhy, e'en despair Is better and more manlier; do but think: Wer't only I, yet there's more dignity In Treasonâyesâit is too lofty a thing To ape the harlequin: to play such tricks As an urchin school-boy, being caught in them Must cry for shame. But thou! what would'st thou? Oh Heaven! The traitor flown, and thou found in his stead Must pay for him. They'll make a show of thee; Prick thee to death with pinsâhawl thee about For a mannish strumpet most unmaidenly: Fling filth upon thy face, and drown thee at last Down in the sewerâdo but think of it! Worse than the hangman's self were such a shame I from my flaunting banner now to flee, And leave thee here at upshot of the game To bide the loss of it. Then, if 'twere not Beyond the utmost patience of Man's pride To think of it, 'tis hopeless quite to do: So prithee, be content, my dearest soul: I have done boldly, and as luck falls ill Boldly will suffer.â âAye, when need shall be But why before? So would'st thou do, what most Thy bloodiest enemies would thank thee done. And, what thou said'st of late, think not of me: For neither came I here for thee alone But for the holy cause. Say then, is't I? Is it my respect that blinds thee from all else, And in this hindrance is thy daring stayedâ The fear to leave me?â âLucy 'tis e'en so, 'Tis e'en that fearâand then the little hope I have to 'scape in such attire as thine. What, is there aught of witchcraft in that cloak? If there be none, then all I see of it Is but a mummery, and no disguise, No, not to cheat a babe. What, talk ye of hope? Despair is the best comforter. Pass only A few fleet hours, and thenââ Stay, Linsingen, Hark! 'tis the turnkey's call, oh yes, I come, Yes, I'll go beg a moment's biding more, 'Tis all we needâfor the rest, it is our own If only we've the heart to stretch our hands And take it.â Saying so, she glided off Like to a ghost, both for her shadowy shape And sudden vanishment: but Linsingen Gazed after her, uncertain of himself: For all that show did seem so strange to him, That he 'gan hope his capture, prison, and all, And bloody imagination of his death Was but a dreamââAway, ye glamouring fiends, The dawn shall scatter ye.â So in that hope He stamped his foot against the heartless stone In proof of it. âAlas! 'tis indeed I, A dreamer's stamp is unsubstantial Nor makes no echoâand his shacklesâah, He feels them notânot quite so gallingly As these wring me. I am no dreamerânoâ Behoves me then the proof that I am none. By Heaven I'll give it, and fight the fiend himself To break my way from Hell.â As thus he spoke His spirit outdared his speech: swelling his tide Of blood, that on his forehead each light vein Was swollen to a snake. Oh! such fierce mood Snatches ten years of life, and flings them in To feed a minute's fire. He waited her That gentle maid, eagerly, but not long Else had he been distraught. She turned to him And how she looked, who had beholden her Had ne'er dared tell the terror of her looks! Haggarder than e'er woman, hurrying back, And deadly pale: as she had gazed on a ghost And caught its ghastly gleaming: fearfully She looked behind as blasted by the breath Of an evil spirit. âSee, he's leagued with us! Hold thereâhis cloakâtake itâhe lends it thee And here his hat and shoesâwhat doubtest thou? Oh take them, or I slay myself outright, Thou need'st them more than he.â Truly she speaks: Nay, stay not, all thy life is crowded here, Each minute tolls thy doom. âOh brave, most brave,â Linsingen answered, rash and recklessly, âWhoever said that gaoler's hearts were flint, Ha, Lucy?â âWhat! dost ask me? 'twas not Iâ His a flint heart! 'twere well for him if 'twere. Whoever said it, I have made that man A liarâyesâI've done itâbut the deed Was all for theeâthereforeâif blood be shed What lookest thou so wild? if blood be shed 'Tis not thy right to dab it in my face. Nayâstart not. What? did'st ne'er see it flow before? Men have been butchers ere now many times And many thanks to them: yet, 'twixt ourselves, Fah! 'tis a nasty trade. Who does its work Needs not white linen. I'll go get me a gown Of blue, but thatâblueâ'tis the badge of Heaven! Crimson were best. Crimson, if ye be wise So were your colour and your works akin, And neither belie th' other: but look here; That is too glaring redâoh, much too fierce! It cries out murder. She who painted it By Heaven, I would not have her conscience For all her skill. Who was it, Linsingen, That should have married her? Tell me, was't thou? Faith, a bold bridegroom.â He saw and started back Gazing upon her: was she that fair girl So suddenly, by some curs'd wizard's art Ungirled to a fury?âthen outbroke her clasp, And like a maniac, groping toward the door Clanking his helpless chains. âNay, go not there Unless thou would'st fain die of laughter fit For the merry sight thou'lt see.â He heard her not In his wild haste: heard nothing, nor yet saw; But rushing blindly onward unaware Stumbled on what was late a living man: But now, dead as the stones whereon he lay The cold damp stones. The lamp fell from his hand And all was darkness. âLucy, I know it well, Thou art an angelâelse sure none but a fiend Had wrought this workâbut oh! thou dear lost thing Thy hands are crimson drenched, while yet thy soul 'Tis like thy cheeks, bloodless as they. Come then Come hither to my arms, and let us forth: Here are his keys, and there's a light outsideâ Must flee, in spite of chains, if hence we can, With the hangman at our heels. What dost thou there Dear love, what would'st?â âNay, prithee, whither away? Dost know of any better cheer than this? Show me as goodâelse I stay here the nightâ A gay guest-house. Aye, is itâor if you will A ghost-houseâgayer yet, but for the gloom And ghastlier. We'd seen it better if thou Had'st not put out the lightâwhy, what could'st mean? Ahâwell I weenâ'twas all for the ghost's sake He loves not lamps: but we'll make merry now All three of usâa ghost, a shackled man, And Iâhow droll! but they chain monkeys, sure, Not menâa monkey, and so sullen and sad! Well, if thou wo'nt, he shall make love to meâ A ghost, you knowâneed not be jealous.â âHeaven, Madness on the heap of all our miseries,â Said Linsingen, with frenzy muttering As he rushed towards her. âCome, take my hand And from this curs'd placeââ âOff from me, off hands Thou'rt an ice-devil. Why, thy clutch is cold, Away with theeâoh help me, Linsingen, Here's a chill devil here would drag me away And swing me by the hair into hell-flames And all for theeâmurdered theeâdost thou say? Aye, sure I did; but why, thou silly fool, Why so superfluous to cry out now? Then was the time when the knife was at thy throat: But being dead, thou wert more mannerly To hold thy peace.â Linsingen stoop'd and kiss'd Her clammy forehead and her cold white cheek, Then raised her up, and as she fell again Huddled her drooping burden o'er his chains And hurried her away. âBetter I too Were madâso turn my woe to merriment, And murder's self to mockery.â While those Distressful two, were struggling against hope, Rescue was near, if timely. On that coast Hermann so fiercely had stirred the multitude That they rose up amain, in surge as stormy As their own sea. Munitions, weapons, men One on another gathering he had sent To Stolberg; where their power held chief state And gave its ordinance. In that turmoil E'en in the hurry and 'mid storm of it There came a floating rumour to his ears And speedily took shape unto his sight In tokens ever dear to him, but such As he scarce hoped to see so soon again Written by Lucy's hand. âLinsingen here Is prisoner in Engthal, and death-doomed: And this, forgive me, by thy father's means Betraying himâhasteâhelp usâhe dies else Ere yet another day.â He read that scroll Delivered to his hand by a strange lad, And what he read, swiftly he did, as tho' Her wish had winged him forward. Forth on that So sudden spur he and some sixty more Forth galloped as the race were for their lives To save or lose them all. Soon their hot speed Had reached a band marching on slacker foot For StolbergââNo, cried Hermann, no my friends Another way and to another end Is now our need.â They heard his tale, as a clap Of thunder in their ears, and hastily Sorrow striving with rage, hope with despair, And hurried eagerness confounding all, They shifted, van with rearward, wide away Whither the danger was. Thick rose the dust And ever thicker, from their hastier march; And every man they met, tho' nought he knew But hearsay, yet his idlest breath heaved up Their hopes and fears in cross bewilderment They were so fitful. Last there met them one A woman. She had seen their friendly approach And ran to hasten it: âOh, Sirs, more speed Or ye lose all. 'Tis but ten minutes' back There pass'd a many soldiers, a score men Into the prison: and the neighbours said Their business was to drag him poor soul forth And shoot him there outright. Each word she said Goaded their eagerness to a mad haste, Their march to a raceâall order broken and lost, And forward, as each could, like a wild herd Driven agad. So scurrying the mid-way They burst into the town; the horsemen first, All with their hottest speed; such an uproar As in some firewrapt wealthy city's sack After its storm. So they careered their course, Those horsemen, wildly, to the market-place, With shouts and brandished swords. There, the first sightâ A guard, quick tramping, with the shackled clank Of prisoners withinâthey hailed the hopeâ He may yet live; as seen, so pealed at once, Recklessly from their hot unwitting hands, A murderous volley. Fled the affrighted foe, Flinging their arms away. âHold, stay your fire!â Hermann had cried to them; but 'twas too late; Fearfully he rode up, and what he saw It turned his fear to frenzy. 'Mid a heap Of wounded soldiers, lay on her father's corse, Who had so risked himself to rescue her, Death-stricken, his life, his Lucy. He raised up Her drooping head, and faintly breathed her name, Faintly, for fear she might not answer him. Fain had she spoken, but her life-blood gushed Forth with her words, drowning all utterance. He gazed on her, pale as her deadly self, So blanched with horrorâand while yet heart-stunned, âSir,â said a soldier, dying with his words, âYe are too late, would ye were earlier come: For we were loath to do on your friend there, On Linsingen, the deed we've done perforce, Shooting him, oh that shot! for our bitterest foe, Whom his life proved him truly our best friend. Black minutes were those fewâthose ye delayed, Else ye'd been welcome to us soldiers too As to all elseâwe'd joined you, heart and hand, 'Stead of this carnage.â Hermann, while he spake, And Lucy in his arms sobbed her death-sob, Noted, nor cared nor felt, nothing beside: But yet one startled glance he looked from her To that man's tale. Then, as she gurgled away, He bore her draggling, to a house hard by, But ere he reached itâAh! what means that hush? She sobs no more. Wouldst know her, whither flown? 'Tis not in that clay thou beholdest her, Raise up thine eyes to Heaven. He sate there By the bed-side, brooking no presence else, A lonely hour; for comfort would he none, Rather some thundering stroke to end him out He would have welcomed it. He prayed that hour Fervently, as they said who watched the door: Then rising sternly from his speechless woe, To those withoutââFriends, forward, before long I'll follow ye!â So bidden, they obeyed. Hermann stayed there: and now as that mishap Cleared of its smoke and stunning din, showed forth The ruin it had wrought, turning surprise Of such a sudden strange calamity To a sad surety: now being alone Left with her, his one joy in all the world And that one deadâforlorn quite, half unmanned He flung himself, recklessly, in the flood Of his despair, as he would 'scape from the world In its dark depth. Dismally was he whelmed Beneath the bitterness that evermore Broke over him; and he, helpless the while, Stirring no whit against it: praying not Nor pondering, but pacing wildly about, Wild anguish. Suddenly, as thus he fared, Fell from his bosom a small book to the ground, A Bible. Stooping to recover it Some spirit whisper'd him âOpen its leaves,â And there he readââFlee, save your life, and be As the heath in the lone wilderness.â Those words, Many have read them, but none ever felt As he did then. Straight was restored to him What grief had troubled, his clear consciousness. He knew his danger, and with a few drear words Commending that loved relict to the shroud, Mounted his horse, and on his fellows' track Swiftly away; but for a breathing time, Drew rein upon the brow of the first hill And backward looked: but dwelt not on that view; For 'twas a troop of eager yeomanry Fast spurring up to the death-house he left To search it thro'. That hint needed no more So on he hurried: till, ere a mile gone He met a messenger, riding at speed As earnest as his own. âSir, we're well met; For I had thought rather to hear of ye Waylaid and taken, than to see ye here So happily; but Sir, no matter of that; I've much to tell of weightiest worth for you. Scarce three hours back, (ye've heard Linsingen's death And how our hopes were well nigh dead with him) Well, there was question 'mong the main of us In our full meeting, whether to leave all For lost; or else who were the worthiest To fill his room. Then many names were rung But none agreed: till haply one called out, (I said it first, and others after me) âWhat doubt ye? surely Hermann is the man, Young Ernest Hermann.â Then was silence there Each waiting each; till to the hustings front Suddenly, like one mad, the old Harper rushed; And such a peal he raised as none e'er heard, Howyou had earned us; had wrought, first to last, Faithfully, a most hard and hopeless work; O'erruling danger with your master skill, Spiriting skill with boldness. Last of all He smote a string that thrilled them wondrously, That you alone are the one man of the world, The very Ernest of the olden time, Looked for by their and their forefathers' hope, Waiting him long in patience, and at last In joy and triumph welcoming him now: Whom that old Hermann falsely father'd thee. Oh, Sir, it told upon them like a spell Beyond all power of will; that they seemed mad, Their wits clean gone. Would ye had heard their shout, Yet better here, out of their over-throng Crowding to greet their kingâfor thou'rt no lessâ They've made thee king, sure as I make this mark, No whisper heard against it. 'Tis e'en so, That is the sum and upshot of it all: Was ne'er such wonder. âSir, I bro't the news, And my poor horse so jaded, had dropp'd else, But he knew what he was bringing. Sir, if a king Can think on a poor man like me, then, Sir, Vouchsafe me.â Hermann scanned him, through and through: âIf true, thy tidings are most strange; if falseâ But noâhearts up and forwardâI'll go see, Follow me thither.â He rode silently But swift, as the eagle, stooping on his prey, 'Till from a height of forelook wideâthere stood Each host 'gainst each, glimmering with war's steel gleam. He viewed them both with watchful wariness, For strange the sight; and needed warranty Whether were friend or foe: nor needed long, For on the spur up galloped, hat in hand A spatter'd heated horseman. âPardon, Sir, My haste, and deign my faithful short intent, For circumstance stands not on this sharp point. Our foes, with their best men, squires, yeomen, lords Chiefly, since none beside they can now trust Are here upon us. Well are they aware How the whole country's up in our behalf, And therefore would they crush our growing strength Ere it be strongerâ'tis their only hope, And failing that, they must fail utterlyâ The ground from under themâthere's our array, You see it, Sir, stretching along the ridge Backed with a bigger but half-weaponed bulk, Fronting to Gilnau: whence the foe comes on Straight on usâtheir vanâdust and bannerâI saw Far off, but nearer now, e'en while we speak; And sure, if we haste not, our folk will lack The comfort of their king. Oh, Sir, 'tis here, 'Tis hard at hand our sharp trial of war. God speed us thro' it!â Hermann heard not all Nor waited not to hear; so sharp a spur Prompted his utmost speed. Thither he rode To a high ridge, where, as that horseman said, Their chiefs held council. Respect, ere he reached, Of eager looks and earnest deference Fore-welcomed him; heads bare, all stilled; each one Waived his own will. What had been done, and what Was there to do, and how the likeliest, He hearkened, and took counsel, and gave command Coldly, as chilled with his foreshadowing doom, Whom death, whene'er, were welcomeâcareless how, Since it must soon. Other dispatch being sped, âSirs,â he address'd them, âWe're a fellowship As faithful as our cause is righteous, And they a hireling crew; far fewer men And damper heartsâthen, for their drill, 'tis but A semblance, their skill too. What, have we a man So girlish, but can hold and handle a gun? As any urchin will, who hath scared crows: No need of hairbreadth cunning; and for our pikes, We're not so palsied but can thrust 'em home As sharp as they their clumsy bayonets; 'Tis will, not skill: for other discipline We need it notâonly withstand them here Stirring no inch. Such stand with our strong ground And God's help for us, is a better ward Than their best onset. We have learned full well That lesson, long inured; we'll prove it now. But this one charge I do commend to ye All that I've here but hinted, all these hopes And vantages, go spread the trust of them Thro' our whole host; cheerfully colouring This my cold phrase: so shall fresh comfort spring To all their hearts. Then, for our ordinance Behoves us to push forth our sharpshooters, No scanty show of them, but a full swarm To infest their marchâbesetting them, all round, At every vantage of hedge, mound, or dyke With hot distractionâbut mind warn them well: To fire from shelter, with cool aim, low, near, Covering well their mark; but far off shot Is only for picked marksmenârepeat this, And send them with the warning in their ears To give the proof of it. Given, 'twere worth No more nor less than victory itself, Else rout and ruin. And now, one word more. If, as he surely will, the enemy Being so galled, should send his skirmishers To sweep them from his side, then let them fall Wide of him, when o'ermatched, only not back Upon our hostâand ever, as they see Their vantage, so return, and ply him again, Still with fresh fire and bitterer eagerness Venging the check. Do but this thoro'ly, Needs nothing more.â He ended, and they did As he ordained. Himself, galloping down Along the array of his armed people rode From end to end. Then such a shout arose So loud and long, that a peal of musketry From twice as many men were faint as a sigh Against itâsure the applause of myriads Bestowed so warmly on one, should swell his heart That heart, so glowing hithertoâbut nowâ Brightness is none to the film-clouded eye Where e'en the sun shows dimly. And when grief Hath made its mourning chapel of the heart, What profits it that splendour is outside Promising gorgeousness of kingly pomp, Wooing the soul of young ambition With such high hopes that e'en the dullest clay Might grow to spirit and aspire with them? Alas! that Man should live on outwardly When dead at heart; cramped by his sorrow down With death's lead-cerements. And yet, tho' self-doomed, Yet he spoke calmly, and that deep stern mood Strengthened his men far more than hurry and heat To trust in him. âI thank ye, my brave friends, I thank ye from my heart. Ye've chosen me To be your leader, and ye see me here Devoted to make good that choice thro' life And unto death. For the instant brunt of war How ye should bear it, and how beat it off, Your chiefs and officers skilled in that kind Have warned ye: warning needless to report But now to do it. There's the enemy Disheartened with sharp checks ere this main brunt, And many rushing or skulking o'er to us. Ye see his van, flashing with spiteful shot 'Gainst our true fellows? What shall I say more? Only, quit ye like men. How! can it be That those your foemen, soulless, hireling slaves Have staked their life but for their slavery's sake That they may live in it? and shall not ye Armed with Truth, Freedom, Right and Godliness, Shall ye not fight eager as fire itself As keen and fierce? Now is your proof, e'en now, To prove your worth. One cheer before I go, Ah? goodâthis shout is valiancy, the next Victoryâsuch clear visions have I seen, Such surety of God: and for God's sake, thro' whom Ye conquer, be not ruthless conquerors But merciful. Once vanquished, all enough Is then avenged. Meanwhile, stand by your stakeâ One hour, and all is yours. ?â By this, the foe Slowly and with much loss, more than his gain Of ground, had won toward the Patriots Within a cannon's range. His mighty mass Lay all as open to their showering shot As a huge bulky ox to the sharp sting Of hornets on each side assailing him; Spite of his rage, and what as little avails His uncouth strength. Many fell slain, yet more Wounded, and all were sore dismayed at heart To see what they ne'er looked for: bloody strife Instead of easy slaughter. There was a ridge Whereon the rebel host made their main stand, And yet a lower one, three furlongs forth, Sea strands of yore; one later, one earlier, With level ground between. There did the foe Beneath the shelter of that nether ridge Stretch out his shattered force: so to redeem Their disarray to a sound order again, And in that pause to breathe, and with free breath Renew their spirit. Then, being so refreshed, With sudden onset storm the upper range Forthright to victory. So they devised: Scattering first their skirmishers abroad For safety of their rear. Safety! ah no, She shrinks from such a neighbourhood. Those swarms Deadly as swift, beset them round again, Ever if driven here whizzing there back From truce, yet keener and thirstier of blood. Till Falkenstein at last, that haughty lord, Thus to his company. âComrades, what now, Are we turned popinjays, that we stand thus To make them sport? No, let us first go clear Yon harvest from the field, then will we back To glean these scatterlings. And, hearken me, No more child's playâno more such silly waste Of shot and powder; but upon them straight With the bayonet.â He spoke, and the word ran Like lightning thro' the line, the bayonet. Upstarted one and all, some daringly, Others in frenzy of bewildered fear, Rushing like sheep to a gate, where but one leads All following. So they hurtled on, and so Were slaughtered: for their foes, strong in that stand, And stronger in their stern surety of aim, Met them with such a crashing storm of shot As broke that living wall to a score gaps, Ruinous carnage. Yet were warm hearts there, High blood and manly pride. What they failed once Framing their force anew, they dared again, And seeâtheir daring wins. Scarce their gun's length Severed them from their foes: if they break in They conquerâyesâif death be victory: They'll know none elseâas the foremost drew their arms Back for the thrust, came such another crash Deadlier than the first. Oh, hold your hands, Is life a worthless bubble, idly blown, To be crushed so recklessly? Then, as they stood Brokenly, wondering each to stand alone 'Mong his fallen fellows.â âSee, they waver; oh, seeâ Cried Hermann, ânow is time to try our steel! One rush, they're swept before us as yon smoke Before the whirling wind.â He spoke, and matched The saying with the deed; forward they burst Fierce as mastiffs unchained. But who can tell The encounter? shouts and groans, and pealing shot Are the only words to speak it: as doomed sprites Fleeing before their devilish torturers, So fled those soldiers: and their conquerors! Ask not if they pursued, if bayonets Wantoned in blood, if savageness for all Answer to supplication smote it down In the act of prayer? No, rather ask of war What he e'er did of direst memory? And then be sure thousand such deeds were done Upon that field. Slowly the sun sank down, And murky red, as with rank vapour of blood, And ever he betokens with the like Some say, that yearly eveâVengeance looked back Smiling a grim smile at the gory sight, Cursing the night that hindered it to slay While yet were men for slaughter. Last their way They wended back, those conquerors, in stern joy, Great gain, small loss: a few score comrades missed And the world won. But Hermann, where is he? Where is the king? Come forth and show thyself, That loyalty may do thee liege-like due, And crown thee with a free crown, laurel-wreathed By Victory. Oh come, they call for thee Thy faithful people. Shine in their glad eyes, And be so kingly in thy grace, as they Are loyal in their love. All ask of thee Wildly and darkly, in tumultuous wise, But none may answer them. Why, 'tis most strange, Strange as the trunk and limbs to stand alone And the head gone. When was it heard before A king was lost and no more known of him More than a beggar's brat? Treason, speak out. Hast slain him? If thou hast, thou'lt answer it Fearfully, to such wrath as ne'er raged yet, The wrath of maddened freemen. But who last Beheld himâwhen and where? What circumstance, What proof? Then many spake, but only one Was minded, for his grey sadness of speech Outweighed the worth of other witnesses. 'Twas he, the trusty shepherd, then came forth And said. âI loved him much and honoured him, And therefore thro' the danger of the day I watched him close. When we broke out at last He was ahead of us, cheering us on: Fearless I followed him, for something he showed More than belongs to man. He rode foreright O'er rough and level, hill, brushwood, and bog, Thro' the wild panic of the enemy, In midst of danger; as one meaning death For himself, not others: striking never a stroke, Firing no shot at all, but with sword hung Heavily from his hand by his horse flank As tho' his arm were shattered. So he rode, And so I followed himâup to the stream, Or hard uponâwhen, as he neared the bank, Down fell my horse, stumbling in the thick furze, I under himâand there, senseless and stunned, I was no more; but rising, after awhile, Looked round, and nought was there in front of me But the swift river flowing silently: Behind, and on each side, the din of war Roaring, as sure ye heard it. I've said all. Heaven grant us better certainly than this That I can show.â Then was much murmuring; Since that trustworthy tale showed them no light, But darker doubtâso strange a sudden eclipse, So awful, as befals no lesser star, Only the sun. Then was the river, too, Questioned with drags and with all likely search To tell the truth. Vainly, for beggar or king Alike he reckons, and keeps all he can. And so perplexity, all means being spent, Stood there with folded armsâbut Time past on Indifferent; and days were heaped on days To a full month; till, in that while, the folk Confess'd the hand of God fulfilling all The olden free faith of their forefathers, And grew to cheerful calm. Then as they met Duly, for statement of their ordinance; And there was question who for their lost king Should rule them in his stead. âNo, we'll have none,â Cried the conspiring universal will, âNo other ruler, only his fatherly Mind, and the wisdom of his latest words. But in his empty throne none else shall sit Till he return. For he but bides his time As Providence on high hath so ordained: And as of late he did, no less again He will revisit us at pinch of need, Watchful whene'er. Meanwhile we'll honour him, Our patriot hero, in honour next to God, With ceremonious due, festal and full, Thro' yearly celebration of set days; And with heart-worship, holier than all And deeper: that the welfare of this land May ne'er forget the trial whence she rose, Nor him, the leader and headspring of all. But hallow evermore her growing weal With the like growth of godly gratitude. So be itâand Ernest, when thou com'st again, As thou would'st find us, so may we be found.â FINIS.</field>
