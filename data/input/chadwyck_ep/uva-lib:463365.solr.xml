      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE and verye noble Lord, Thomas Earle of Qrmounte, and Ossorye, Lorde Butler, Vicounte Thurles, Lord of the libertie of Typparye, and highe Treasurer of Ireland, Tho. Drant maister of Arte, and student in Diuinitye, wisheth increase of honor, with all felicitye. Of the Arte of Poetrye. A Paynter if he shoulde adioyne vnto a womans heade A longe maires necke, and ouerspred the corps in euerye steade With sondry feathers of straunge huie, the whole proportioned so Without all good congruitye: the nether partes do goe Into a fishe, on hye a freshe Welfauord womans face: My frinds let in to see this sighte could you but laugh a pace? Pisoes truste me, that booke shalbe muche lyke vnto this same, Whose fancies lyke a sickemans dreames so rudelye hange in frame, That heade and feete do square from th whole. Poets, and painters aye Haue had lyke charter to attempte all kynde of worke (you saye). I know, I craue this libertie, and geue the lyke also. But not that matters wilde, and mylds without reason should goo Blended as one, seynge Poets may, this leaue they do not fynde Serpents with byrds, Tyger with lambes to ioyne againste their kinde. To bigge beginnings, and vauntynge ofte tymes a purple clowte Of words impertinente is brought, to helpe the matter oute: When wooddes, Temples or riuers course which hastely doth glyde, When rushing Rhemus is descriude, or rayne bowes painted pride. Such babble (God wote) needed not, but sum of that sorte be, There common place, and theame is still upon the This prouerbe grevv vpon a badd painter, that could paint nothinge but the Cypresse tree. Cypresse tree. If that sum man would haue strange things, and geson geare depainted, How can he earne ought in such case that is with nowghte acquainted? Let things be formall of one kinde and do not chop it vp To make tone part a gallon potte, and tone a prittie cup. The more deale of vs Poets, both the olde, and younge most parte, Are ofte begylde by shewe of good, affectinge to muche arte. I laboure to be verye breife, it makes me verye harde. I followe flowinge easynes, my style is clearely marde For lacke of pith and sauerye sence, Write loftie, thou shalte swell: He creepes by the grounde to lowe, afrayde with stormie vayne to mell. He that in varyinge one pointe muche would bringe forth monstruouse store, Would make the dolphin dwell in wooddes and in the flud the bore. The shunning of a faulte is such that now and then it will Procure a greater faulte, if it be not eschewde by skill. Our blacke smith Imus oftentimes in brasse will vndertake The nales and hayres of sundrie men righte conninglye to make. A much vnhappie workmanship which neuer cums to ende. If euer I should take in hande eyther to make or mende, Er I would do such parcell acts and nowght to full ende bringe, Erste would I weare a croked nose or in the same a ringe. Picke out such matter ye that wryte thats meetest for your strengthe. Trye well your backs, what theie wil beare, or what not beare at lengthe. He that hath chewsde his matter suche as he can well assayle, Nor ticklinge eloquence, nor him shall lightsum order fayle. This is of order, as I iudge the vertewe, and the grace, Sumtimes to speake, sumtyme to leaue, and passe bye for a space, That one might speake, and caste it of vntill a further tyme. Let him with choyse chewse, and refuse that would set forth a ryme. Thou must be suttle, and warye in placing of thy geare. By wittie composition its excellente to heare. A knowne worde straunged hansumlye. If we haue neade to shewe Newe wordes for things, which things them selues are now inuented new, Wordes neuer vsde of other men is beste for to deuise. Licence is graunted if it be vsed in shamfaste wyse, And nouell words inuented late. shall better credit bringe, If sparinglye, not violentlie They sourde from greekishe springe. The Romans to Cecilius, and Plautus leaue to faigne Why should they geue, and from Uirgil and Uarye it detaine T'inuente a fewe wordes if I can why should they so me hate? Since Ennius, and Catos toungue our mother toungue of late Inritchde, and brought vp nouell termes. it is, and euer shall Be lefull to geue name to that, that hath no name at all. As wooddes are made debayre of leaues by turnyng of the yeare, The oldest fall: So antique age of words away do weare. As lusty youths of cresciue age doe florishe freshe and grow And crepe in creditt and conceit, whiche whilom were full lowe And we, and ours are due to death. hauens, and creakes, the grounde Nowe tamde with plough, which heretofore vnfruitfull hath bene founde, Attempts of kings, which were deuisde for wealth of nations then Shall perish all, and perish shall the facts of mortall men. Much lesse of speaches longe can lyue the honour and the grace. Ful manie a worde that now is dashd shall ryse gain in space. As these in space muste feele theire fal, if vse do lyke them ill, Who hath to iudge, autorish, reule, all maner speache at will. The facts, the seats of kings, and dukes and baylful battailes sad, What kynde of verse is beste for them In Homer maye be had. In rymes vneauen, at first complaints and after in that kynde Were written fansies dumpes, and all affections of the mynde. But who the prittie Elegies fyrst on their feete did set, Grammarians stryue, and that case is in controuersie yet. Rage armed fyrst Archilacus with his Iambus verse. Our commodies, and tragedies, in whiche we do reherse, For interchaung of talke right meete, which doth in sounding passe The noyse of crowde, to set forth things. that vearse inuented was. The Musies taughte in lyrike verse the Goddes, and theire of springe The warlike vigor, and that horse, which pryce away did bringe, Amors of youth, and and banquets francke on instruments to sing, If I nor can, nor know to kepe an order due at all Ne coloure braue my writings, why, sholde they me Poet call? Lewde that I am why do I shame to learne which I ne know? One maye not thinke things comicall in Tragike blasts to blowe. Phyestes feaste is ill set out with simple words and tame. Let all things haue theire comlye roume well fitted in the same, Sumtymes the commodye lookes vp and liftes her voyce with all. And crabbed Chremes for his thrifte with open mouth will brall. The tragicall doth sumtymes talke as meanelye as one can: Syr Teliphus, and Pelius, both pore, and exiles then Put out no puffes, nor thwackyng words words of to large assyce If by their words they meane to moue affects in any wyse. Not lore enough in Poesis, let them be sweetlye fynde, And let them leade to where them liste the hearers plyante mynde. The cheares of men as theie will smerke on those that vse to smyle: So are theye wrinchd, when theye do weepe and chaungd within a whyle. If thou wouldste haue me weepe for the firste muste thou pensyfe be. Thy harmes shall hitte me, when I spye that they haue harmed the. If Teliphus or Pelius your words be out of place, Wyse men will sleepe, whiles theye are spoke and laughe at them apace Sad wordes be set a sorye face thretynge the vysage grim For iokand, wanton, for the sage ryghte seriouse wordes be trim. Nature before the outward acte doth frame vs to eche hap By secret workinges of hir owne: In pleasures she doth lap, Or shoueth on the harte with ire, or presseth to the grounde. The vanquishd brest with dolors dinte, then shunninge to be bounde To inward passions of the minde, she powreth oute at longe The drirye drawghte of al her thoughtes with benefyt of tounge. If vnfyt for the personage the talke do ronne awrye, The nobles, and the prease therewith will strike vnto the skye. The page, or peare, whether doth speake It skilleth nothing more A freshe hote younker cocke braine, wylde, or old man, sage, and whore. A matrone ritche, or paynefull nurse, the marchaunte venturer, Or he that fewe good fassions knowes th' unciuill grounde tiller. The Colcus, or assyrian, at Thebes, or Arge vp broughte, If circumstaunces be not markt the matter wilbe nought. Writer, of who so thou shalt wryte speake, as the moste men say, Or if thou feyne, feyne then the things as truthlyke as you maye. If thou wouldest set Achilles oute As other men haue done, Let him be swift, chafing, vnprayed, inflamde to vengaunce sone. Let him denie that lawes were made for him or any suche. Let him by weapon beare him stowte, and thereby chalange muche. Let Medea be ferse, on mowde, let Ino still be sad, Ixie trothlesse Io wandring, Orestes neuer glade. A straunge attemptate to the stage if that thou darst commit, And darste a personage vnseene, in nou ell mannor fitte: Marke well, wherwith thou didst begin, and vse the matter so That top, and tayle in lyke semblaunte, and tennor true may go. Much hard it is in proper talke to write a thing vnknowne. Better it is the Ilyads to stage ageine were drawne, Then that thou shouldest in practise put things knowne, nor hard before. A publique matter may be thought to cume from pryuate store, If that one do not treade out right, the trodden, vsed waye. Thou shalt haue no regarde at all word for word to oute lay. If thou wouldest turne things faythfullye and do not imitate So iumpingly, so precyselie and step, for slep so strayte, That what for shame to wade on still or ells to ende the thinge As it began, thou canst not moue ne yet thy foote out bringe. Begin not as that Poet once that fowle mouthe Cyclike lowte Pryams fortune, and famous fightes, at full I will layt oute, What will our promiser tell vs for suche a gaping fitte, The Mountaines trauayle, we shall haue a mouse to laughe at it. How much more cicumspectlie he which nothing did a misse, How were his wits aduysed well when he inuented this. Set out my Muse to me the man Since Troye taken (? he) VVhich did the manners of much men, and sundry Cytties see. Not smoke of flame, but flame of smoke he woulde haue to procede, And learne of him, if thou woldst make a poesie in deede. Not Antiphas, Scylla, Cycloppes, Charibdis to displaye, Nor Dyamede from brothers death how that he came awaye. For writing of the Trioane warr and Greekes fayre buskinde leggs, He doth not fetche his matter downe from Ladye Ledaes eggs, He hasteth on vnto the happes, the hearer hee doth drawe Into the thickst, &amp; lets I, him tast, as he the whole did know. The things that hee doth quyte dispayre, t'intreate to good effecte, To spare his laboure, and his words he doth it all reiect. So feyneth he, things true and false so alwayes mingleth he, That first with midst, and middst with laste, maye cotten, and agree. What I and all require of the this for thy learning harke. If thou wouldest haue vs stand stocke still, and to the ende to marke, That when the Epilogue is done we may with franke intent, After the plaudite stryke vp our plausible assente: Of fortes, and ages thou must note the mannor and the guyse. A decensie for stirring youth, for elder folke likewise. ChildhoodeThe childe as he can speake and go furthewith is glad of play, A mongst his mates, and gathers hart to cuffe, and learnes to fraye: And this he hath peculiar he changeth without reason. No one thinge is, that can like him but for a very season. YoutheUnbearded youth, at last rid from the Tutors barring charge, Horse, hauke, or hownde, flaunt, &amp; carouste into the fielde at large. Plyaunt as war to any sinne most spytefull, and most fell, To those that seeke his proofit most by warning of him well. A slacke prouyder for him selfe a squanderer of goold, Hawtie, hastye sone hote in loue, and sodanly as could. Mans state, and mynde doth turne that trade he ginnes to caste his eye Manhoode To rytches, and acquayntaunce strayghte and hauks to be on hye. He takes good heede, not to commit through giddines of brayne The facte, which he for very shame must nedes vndo againe: Old men haue much encombrances Age the myser spendes his witte, In gettinge, and the gotten spares nor dares he spende of it. Couldlie, and toto tymerous his sentence he doth geue Prolonginge, hoping, past his woorke, desyerouse aye to lyne, Churlishe, wranglinge, a prayser of the tyme he lyued in. A solemye Censor, and chastner of euery younge mans sinne. As yeares do helpe vs mightely whilst we cum at a staye: So after they disuauntage vs, and breake vs to decaye. Leaste youth of age, and age of youth do saye, and play the parte To shape oute things accordyngly besetes a Poets arte. Matters be either done on stage, or to ulde how they were done, The things reported to the eares moue not the myne so sone. As lyuely set before thyne eyes, in acte for to behold: Such actes as may be done within no reason is they shold Be shewed abroade: And many thinges thou maiste remoue from sighte, Which good, and ready eloquence may staight way bring to light. Medea may not openly her tender children slay, Nor wicked Atreus mens gutts in sethinge vessels play. Nor Progne turne into a bird, Nor Cadmus to a snake. I trust nothing thou shewes me so but in woorst parte it take. The play that would be sought after and often cum in place, Must haue fyue acts, nor more, nor lesse for therein is a grace God must be none brought on the stage, but in such case and tyme, When mortall man, cannot reforme nor dignely plage the cryme. Enoughe for fower to speake in sight, And if the nede be suche That moe must talke, cut of the last and let them not speake much. Th' autor the Chorus must defende or els some other one Whose innocensie, or manhode deserueh prayse alone. Let them not singe twixt act, and acte that squayreth from the rest. Such let their songs be, as will tune vnto the purpose best. Let them leane euer to the good, and ioyne in verdict cleare, Rewle the vnrulie, and loue them which to offende they feare. Let them prayse homelie, simple cheare, and wholsume iustice prayse, Lawes, and safe rest with open gayts, and peace in all the wayes. Let them conceale things credited, to God oft let theim praye, That lucke may growe vnto the meeke, and to the prowde decay. The shawme was not as it is nowe with copper wrythed in In trumpet wyse but small it was, few breathinge holes, and thin. Fit for a Chorus and as yet the boystus sounde, and shryll, Of trumpetes clange, the stalles was not accostomed to fill. Came thether folke sone numbred, for why, the crowde was small A thriftie flocke, a shamefast flocke, and therto chast withall. But when by conquest they began theire borders to extende, And brode their walls abowte the towne for pompe were made to bende, And when that men had felte a swete in daylye bellie cheare, So banquetinge eche hollyday without remorce or feare, Theire musicke, and their melodye increased more and more. The hobbes as wise as grauist men, rid from their trauaile sore, The moste vntowarde and vntaught, most contemptible clowne, As perte as pye dothe presse amongst the wysest of the Towne. So, motions and wantonnes, vnto his former art The minstrell addes, as hoyting he as any of his part. Then with the twanginge instrumente the singers voyce did matche, And that did nouell Eloquence, and loftie speaches hatche. A solemne speake mete for great things, which knoweth after clappes: A speach wherin the Delphique Phœbe might tell men of their happs. He that stroue first in Tragicke verse, but for a sillie gote, Set out Satyrs incontinente, things rustical (god wote.) With wholsom bitter grauitye he proued to make sport, With allurements, and newe conceyts, to please a doltishe sort, A sort past grace, and dronken to, vnrewlie, rude and rashe. We may not so prayse Satyrists, which sumtymes for a crashe, Make many mery with their taunts, and geue theim leaue to play, So that both godds, and noblemen in splendent vestures gay, Sham not their garm?ts, &amp; them selues with common ale house talke. The Tragedie muste shun the grounde, yet not in welking walke, And retche to hye, thoughe to prattell of peltinge bables small, Is not of nature Tragical, nor fit for it at all. The matrone blusheth, that is bod to daunce in open day, So sober Satyrists must be amiddste their frollicke play. To those that only loue the rewde, and signifyinge worde In Satyrs, I a Satyriste Pisoes do not accorde, Nor will not so confounde my termes, that difference none be, Twixt Dauus, and bould Pythyas. The shrew, the damsell, she Who could cosen olde Simo syre and at his hands coulde gayne, A tallant by collusion, and sleight ligerdemayne. The rurall Gods must haue their speache if they do speake in prese. I would indyte familiarlie and vtter with myne ease, That eche man may assure him selfe, to do the like agayne, But when he shall attemptate geue. he shall but sweat in vayne. Order, and composition, so in them selues excell, And meane matter cleanly set out deserueth prayse so well. The rurall goddes (if I can iudge) must looke in any case That they speake not lyke ciuill folkes, brought vp in peopled place. Theire rymes maye not to gamesum be, of rybawdrye to ryfe, Or slaunderouse: for vnto sum it brings offence and stryfe. The noble, honorable, rytche, and also most of those Which ought can do, will snuffe, and take it peper in their nose. What Tom, and Tib do rectefie, what lykes the carter clowne, The wyse men take not in good parte, nor couer it wyth crowne. Iambus a foot of ii sillables vvhere of the first is short the second longe.The foote of Syllabs shorte, and long Iambus hath to name. A muche swift foote, and trymeter (the verse which of the same, Consists) is cawld, with six wight feete it speedelie doth strike. The first and last as all the rest in pure verse are a lyke. That more slowlie, and more grauelye, it might cume to our eares, It now the stade Spondeus foote within it quyet beares. In the fourth Roume and seconde roume Iambus still hath bene. In Ennius or Accius, Spondie is seldom seene. Bugge verses which cum to the stage with waight of wordes alone Louslie layd out, to sone suruayd, hauinge of science none. A learned iudge wil passe on them as giltye of great cryme. What thoughe sum iudges can not marke the iarringe of a ryme. And what thoughe Romains Poets to an ample charter haue? should I goe wryte at Randonne tho, and vage abroade, and raue? Or should I thincke my faltes would be subiecte to all mens sight? Within the hope of pardon, I employed haue my mighte To scape from scapes, and them to shun by all possible wayes: Wyth all my hart I do confesse I neuer erned prayse. The presidentes of greake wryters to know, and vnderstand, Reede them, and turne them day and nighte with neuer ceasing hand. Our forefathers, which Plautus rymes, and tothesume sweetned vayne, With lodes of commendations did prayse, and prayse againe: It was in them greate patience, follye I will not say, So to admire his verse, or vayne, nether is veray gaye. If I or you the taunting grace can iudge from scurrill gere, Or can measure the lawe of sounde by fingering, or by eare. Thespis to fynde out Tragidies bestowed firste the paynes, And led about his players, and his playing stuffe in waynes. Sonnets to singe, and things to speake in that vnparfit case, The personages were disgysde by smering of theire face. Next him of viserdes, and attyre was founder Eschilus. How that the stage adornde should be he firste instructed vs. To excercyse lowde speakinge, and to couche alofte our voyce, To teache all kynde of iesturyngs with cumlines, and choyse. Nexte came the antique commodie and she wun all the prayse. Hyr licence hath made dissolute and lawlesse now a dayes. But stayed was, and whiste she was whishde to her vtter shame, Because gone was hyr priueledge so bitterly to blame. Our Poets lefte nought vn assayde, and they not worship leaste Deserued haue, who of them selues aduenterously haue ceasde Further to trade in greekishe steppes: and bouldlye starte vp then The iollie iestes of natyue land in natyue toungue to pen. As Italie in Chiualrie, and manhood doth excell: So ere this time in perfitte speach it mighte haue borne the bell, But that our lither Poets all of one disease are sicke: Theye cannot stay to scum theire stuffe, nor lumpishe trauaile licke. You Pisoes (blood of Pompelie) those verses reprehende, Whiche longe deliberation and rasinge did not mende And hath not ten tymes bettered, and on the fingers scande, Correcting, and perfyting them with ouernotynge hande. Because Democrites iudgd art to be more basse then witte, Therefore those drummidories seeke so sleightlie after it. And for because from Helicon the same man did exclude All those, whiche were not straught of sence: those lurdons are so lude To let theire berde, and nayles growe out to shun the open bayne, Of hills, and dales, and secret steades he feanes him to be fayne Thoughe all the pothigaries stuffe can scarcely purge his nowle He thinckes hym wyse, his solempne bushe because no man doth powle. O dottrell I, I might or this haue written noble geare But that from collor, I am purgd at springe tyme euery yeare. It matters not, I am therefore a whetstone in my wit, Which can cause Irne and style to cut ne cut it selfe a whit. I will teach others how to do, the paynes I will not take. I will tell them how to be ritche, what dyet, what will make A Poet good, what doth becom, and what vnsetting is. To what virtew will vs conducte, and erroure leade amis. Of righte writinge dame wysedome is the fountayne, and the well, As do the bookes Socraticall purposedlye the tell And wordes will cum vpon the faste at elbowe waytyng due If that the matter in the mynde thou wilte before suruew. He that hath learnde, what he doth owe vnto his countrie deare, Unto his parentes, brothers, frinds, what duetie he doth beare: What doth concerne the Senatour what doth the iudge behoue: What doth become the chifetan beste to set vpon and moue: Him dare I warraunte of my worde that he can tell, or none, What properlye is incidente to persons euerychone. The learned imitatour, I do wishe that he should caste An eye into the lyfe of men and practyses now paste, That he maye to the verye quicke his lyuelie phraises lay Sumtimes an honest merye tayle (lasciuiousnes away) Delytes, and stayes the people more, then do a thousande rymes Deuoide of matter, shrill trifles and waterde well with crimes. The muse gaue wit to Greekes, to Greekes a trowlinge tounge she gaue: Who onely glorie, and renowne were couetouse to haue. The Romans now do teach theyr sonnes no other kynde of artes, But all day longe do set and part, a sum into his partes. Learne them to multiplye an ounce by ounce and manie ounces, So that this thing to multiplie still in theire mynde reiounses. And nusled once in casting counts and care to multiplye When to cancard coyne castynge once, theire wittes theye do applye, How can we thincke that they can make or that theire verse should be Worthie in Ceder to be writ or kepte in Cypres tree. The Poets seeke to proffit the, or please thy fansie well, Or at one time things of proffit and pleasaunce both to tell. In all thy preceptes be thou briefe that learners quicklye maie Conceiue thy words, and that the same in faithfull mynde to staye. What s'euer is superfluose, to muche, and oftens tould, Doth fill the hearer paste the brim that long he cannot hould. The things thats fainde for pleasure sake be nexte to true in place. No commodie can hope to haue all credit in eche case. To bringe in as a trim deuise an ould wyfes chat, or tale Of wiches buggs, and hobgoblings, such trashe is noughte to sayle. Unprofitable Poesies, the sage sorte will not heare And austere woorkes, the youthfull sorte will ouerlooke them cleare. He beares the bell in all respects who good with sweete doth minge: Who can in delectable style good counsaile with him bring. His bookes the stationers will bye, beyonte Sea it will goe, And will conserue the authors name a thowsand yeare, and mo. Yet certayne Peccadilians which scape yea in the beste, Are to be borne the better with by reason of the reste. For not the lute string alwayes strikes, as hande, and minde would haue. It will sounde base, and lowe when we an highe lowde stroke woulde haue. Nor yet the bowe dothe euer hitte the thinge which it doth threate. If that the more deale of the worke be bewtifull and neate, A fewe scapes shall not greue me muche, with negligence let lye, Or which because that we are men muste now and then passe bye: What then? he that compyles a worke, and warned doth offende In one thinge ofte, is perdonles if that he dothe not mende. As maye that minstrell well be mockd, and woorthelie I wisse, Which euer of the selfe same stringe dothe vse to stryke amisse. So he which ofte is ouerseene is Cherilus to me, Whome writynge two or three good rimes I maruaile at with glee. Yet am righte wrothe that any good should cum from such a sotte. Good Homer now and then him selfe will slumber well I wotte. If that our woorke be longe and huge. so harde it is to kepe Our selues wakinge, it is dispensde if sumtymes we do sleepe. A Poesie is picture lyke, the which if thou stande nere, Delytes the muche: sum picture more if further of thou were. This hathe a better grace in darke, and this in open day, The scanning skill of viewinge iudge can it no whit afraye. This Poesie hath had his tyme it was well liked once, An other hath bene lykd ten tymes, An, Aperse for nonce. (O eldeste of thy bretherne all) althoughe with fathers voyce Thou arte well taughte, and of thy selfe thou haste a sauerie choyse. Yet take this sainge of my mouthe and take it with the cleane. Sum thing there is, which will admit a tollerable meane, Th' attorney and the counsaloure thoughe theye be meane in plea Unlyke to them which at the barre and benche do beare the swea. Natheles in estimation theye both haue bene, and are. And many a man for theire aduyce will seeke to them from farre. But that meane Poets were the beste that neuer graunted yet Or God, or man or monuments or euidence of writte. Ill sawses, or ill melodie when we do suppe, or dyne Is little worthe, for those aparte, the feaste mighte haue bene fyne: So Poemes first deuisde, to sporte, and recreate the mynde Are beste, or worste by standinge in or qualynge from theire kynde. He dare not turney, nor yet tilte which neuer knew the play: The stoole ball, top, or camping ball if suche one should assaye As hath no mannour skill therin, Amongste a mightye croude, Theye all would screeke vnto the skye and laughe at hym aloude. Yet he that knows no foote in verse will bouldly versefy. What els? he is a gentleman, ten thowsande francklins lye By him to spende, and besydes that so woorshipfull a man: Such qualityes, and of greate cryme no man conuicte hym can. Yea, gentle men are goodlye men, what so theye will, they maye: But Piso, againste nature thou shalte nothing doe, or say. For so thy selfe art mynded to: But if in after time Thou shalt haue great affection to publishe any ryme, Let it be first examined, by Metius his eare, And by thy fathers, and by myne: kept cloase a nyne longe yere. The scrowles which be at home with the at leasure thow mayst mende. The faltes thats passed once in print, are passed without ende. The holly one greate Orpheus the goddes enterpreter, The saluage folke from beastlyke life, and murder dyd deter: So sayd the Tygers to aswage and Lyons rampinge power. So was it sayd of Amphion founder of Theban tower, With twang of harp to stir the stones, with orisons deuyne To leade th' unwylde creatures to where he would assyne. This was the wisedome in those dayes, this counted they their gaine, To part thinges publique from priuate and sacred from prophaine. For to inhibit wandring lustes and wedlocke knot to tye, Lawes to ingrale in during brasse, and reare up townes on hye. So got the godlike poets first their honoure, and their name, And for their verses al the world did celibrate their fame. Then started noble Homer vp, and Tyrtheus with verse Did make the lustie youthfull bruits to battel fresh, and fearse. By verses were mens fortunes tolde and rewles to lyue aright, And princes fauoures were procurde by verse, and ryming sleighte, Uerse is a solace, after worke, a chase for noble game, And perdie man to versifie it nede be thoughte no shame. For madam muse could tune the harpe, Appollo knew the same. If verse prayse worthie written were by nature or by arte, Demaunde hath bene, but I am thus resolued for my parte, That neyther studie can do good without a welthie witt, Nor yet the witt not well applied can proffit one a white, So witte, and, studie lincked are, so doth the one requyre The others helpe, so louengly in one they do conspyre. He that doth studie to cum to the marke, which all men would, Hath sufferde, and done muche in youthe oft sweating, and oft coulde, Refrainde from wyne and Uenery. The minstrel that doth singe. Was taught, and fearde his master firste er he profest the thinge. Now its enoughe to say, that I can passing poemes make, Since eche man bragges, the lagge of vs A shendefull shame him take. I thincke it shame to cum behynde, to graunt I do not shame, In that which I was neuer tawghte me skillesse in the same. The Cryer, as he cawles in on the companye to bye In portesaile of his marchaundise as they do thether hye: So doth the poet, ritche in lande, and ritche in banqued goulde, Assemble al his parasyts to heare his prayses toulde. If that a poet vsuallie mantayneth lusty cheare, And wilbe suretie for pore knaues in suites them to vp beare, I maruaile if that his fortune and goodlucke should be such To know false flatterers, from true frends, theire faces wilbe such. If thou hast geuen any ought, or further dost intende Beware to any merrie greeke thy verses to commende. He wil crye wel, notablye well, passing, exceding well, He will waxe pale from frendly eyes his teares he will expell. Daunce, and bedunche the grounde with fote as those which hyred be To waile, and morne at funeralls (as far furth as wee see) Both do, and speake more heuily and rufull in their kinde, Then those which inwardly with griefe, are gryped in their minde. So be the iesters gesterings and glosinge wordes, aboue The prayses of the well meaninge, who doubtles do the loue. Great princes vse to make muche of, to feast, and feast agayne, With strong, and heady drinkes t'assay what was the wit and brayne, Of those to whom theire amitye they ment for to admit. To proue how they for grande affayres and trusty things are fit. If thou professe a poetrie be not deceyued, bewayre, And shun the flyring feasting face which outwarde lookes so fayre. If one vnto Quintilius, did any thing reherse, Frend (would he saye) you must correct both such, and such a verse. If he replye, that he ne knew better to make the same He would assaye yet twyse or thryse and bid him mende, from shame, To lay his rude ill turned stuffe againe into the frame. If thou hadst rather to defend then to amend thy misse Thou shoulde neuer haue conference, nor counsaile more of his, Thou mightst march on in thyne owne wayes without his further suit, And hugge, and, busse, and cull, and cusse thy darling apishe fruite Th' vnsauerie verse the goodman, and the wise will reprehend, Blame those diffuse, and obscure rymes, which to no good can tende. Bald lattin he will note and marke, with scraping of their thum, And ornaments superfluouse from better chaffer scum. He must make manifeste darke drifts, and argue at thinges straunge, He must lyke Aristarchus tel what eche one ought to chaunge. And thinke not much his very frende in trifles to offende. These tryfles wil proue earnest things, and seriouse in the ende. When al the worlde shal them deryde and greuously theym grudge And when al shal withe auckwarde doume and sinister them iudge. To those which haue the fawling euil and lothely leprosye, That be frantike and moone sicke, none dare bouldly passe hym bye: All men do feare the poet mad, the wise sort wil him shun, Younge boyes him vex, the foolish flocke wil do as he hath done. He that dothe belch out puffinge rymes, and gaddingly doth straye, Is like the fowler, who to catche his birdes, as olde men say, Gaue backe for nonce, into a trenche, and thoughe a prease past by, And thoughe with rope to haile him out were present helpe hard by: What if the fellowe, sayeth one, went in with his good wil? Through this and such the sillie segge lay plasde in puddle still To know how vyle, vaine glory is, how perillous a thinge, Empodocles of Sicilie to what ende it did bringe Tell you will I: of immortall to purchase him the name, For vaine glory he scipped quicke to Etnaes fyerye flame. In good time poets, if they will, may make them selues awaye, And who so letteth such an one: as rightly might one slaye, May happes he hath assayde before how to procure his bayne, May happes if he were nowe fore stayde his staing were in vaine. Still would he be besides him selfe nor would not lay a syde The fancie towardes famouse death wherin he had a pride. And no man knowes, what cause he had to write such frantike gere How irreligiouse he hath bene deuoyde of godly feare, But mad hee is, and like a beare most ragingly he straynes, And if he could with al his force dispatche him of his chaynes. Learnd, and vnlearnd he woulde confounde, he redeth them so fearse, And doth theire workes so snapingly, and snatchingly rehearse. Whom he hath seased, on, he houldes and doth with reading kil, The horseleach will not leaue the hyde but hauing suckt her fil. [The first book of Epistles] Horace his Epistles to Mæcenas O thou the matter of the first the matter of these laste Uerses of myne, (Mecenas Lorde) this is thy very cast Yet once againe t'acquaint me with my wonted ryming game, Me, that am throughlie tryde in that and victor in the same. Not age a lyke nor minde a like, the valiant man of warre May leaue his armes, and liue at lengthe a parte from scirmage farre. Him needes not when his race is run the people much to praye, He hath lycence by lawe of armes in time to goe his waye. A thinge I haue within my selfe that beates vpon mine eare, And dassheth often in such sort that clearely I may heare, How it doth warne me to be wyse to rid me from this race, And timely to, lest I becum a tyred iade in space. A croked caple, who when he hath trauailde any whyle Will halt downe right at length &amp; pante, and make a number smyle. And therefore now I lay my rimes. and other toyes a syde Deuysing things of hone stie, and therin holy byde. That whych may serue to guide my selfe I muse vppon and make. And leaste thow aske what Chifetan I, to what sect I do take, To none so bound, to sweare vnto what s'euer he shall saye. To where the tempest carieth me a straunger borne away. Sumtymes I skude abowt the towne in ciuyll matters drounde, A champion roughe and practyser of vertue straite and sounde. Sumtymes on Aristippus lore by stealthe I cease on it, The thinges to me, not me to things, I would they should submit. Long is the night to them whose griefe alrest doth quyte exyle: The labouringe man doth thinke one daye a longe, and dreary whyle: Slowe seames the yeare vnto the warde which houlden downe must be In custodie of stepdame straite: Slowe slydes the time to me, Unwelcome tymes, which do forslow my hope, and fixed mynde, With corage to accomplishe that which ritche and poore shall finde Of proffit like, the which thinge to if it be left vntolde, The not knowing therof may be like hurte to younge and olde Remaynes, with these fewe principles my selfe to rule, and stay, And throughe my skill surcreasd in me thus to my selfe to saye. Though one cannot lyke Linceus with pearsing eyesight see, To mende his sighte he maye not grudge inoynted for to be Lyke lustie Glyco thou dispayres in lymmes to be so stoute Yet maye thou exercyse thy selfe to shun the knottie gowte. A man maye clim a step, or twayne thoughe he goe not beyonde. Thy breste doth boyle with couetyse, with lustinge vyle, and fonde, Sainges there be, and sawes there be to cure thy greedie care: To master thyne assaltynge fyttes to purchase thy welfare. And doste thou swell with loue of prayse? Such sacred salues there be, Rede the prescriptions through but thryse and I dare warraunte the, Th' enuyouse, angrye, drunken, slowe, the louer lewde and wylde None so outeragiouse, but in tyme he maye becume full mylde. If he to good aduertisemente will retche his listenyng eare, And meekely byde with pacience the counsaile he shall heare. It is virtue, vice t'auoyde and wysedome cheefe of all Follie to wante: these two ills lo do vex the at thy gall. A slender stocke, and sharpe repulse. to shun, and voyde these twayne, Howe dost not thou disease thy mynde, and plye thyne heade wyth payne? A pace thou scuddes to traffique with the furdeste folke of Inde, Through Seas and rockes, throughe fyer and all leste thou be caste behynde. Contemne those things, which sodainelie thou doste wishe, and admire: Wilte thou not learne nor heare, nor truste, the wyse at his desyre? Who would (sayest thou) goo practise fence In euerie towne, and streate, And then refuse Olympus crowne if he with it mighte meate, A pleasaunte thinge, so pleasauntlye without muche stiflynge duste: Good toylinge faste, and for the beste since trauaile needes I muste. Siluer is baser muche then gould, and goulde then virtew worse. O, neyghbours, neyghbours, first get coyne firste hardlye pragge the purse, And then seeke virtue after gould, so saye our marchauntes lo: So chaunte the younge, so chat the olde, all occupyers so. Theire powches, and theire counting bookes are glewed to theire handes, For this we see, nor can but see, the case on this sorte standes: Though thou haste witte and courage good, and manners mylde by skill, Thoughe thou beeste craftie, and canst welde thy pleading tounge at will, If thou haste all thinges competent: an other more then the, Thou arte thoughte course, and he a kinge: thy better muste he be. The Romane children haue a songe, whiche carrall doth they call A kyng and keaser if to sinne thy selfe thou doste not thrall. Not to be giltye or wax wan at anye falte at all, A bulwarke that, to beare all bruntes, be that the brasen wall. The lawyere Rossy made this lawe, that all shulde be estemde, For onely wealthe: that blood, and skill as nowght worthe should be deemde. Per frendship whether better nowe Syr Rossius lawes, and toyes, Or that whiche I did carrall call the ballad of the boyes? That ballad crownes all iuste lyuers, and euerye woorthie wighte. Seeke crownes of fame, for well lyuynge, not goulden crownes for sight. Who gaue the better counsaile? he whiche biddes the learne to thryue By ryghte, if not to catch, and scrape whilste thou arte man alyue. To saile in welth, (a ship forsothe where thou maiste plaine behould The rufull falles which they haue had that put theire truste in gould): Or he, that biddes the stande vprighte gainste fortune, and hyr pryde, And chearelye willes the to be bould not once to skew a syde? If sum aske me why I ioy not from barre, or benche to talke Sythens I vse so commenlye mongste lawyers for to walke Why I do not embrase or flye which moste men loue or hate As once vnto the Lyon crasde the fox that suttle pate Did make reply, so answer I: the foteprints do me fray Which lye and looke toward the caue, none lye or looke this way. Should wyse men seeke to please the moste? what proffit, or what gaynes? Whome should I eye? the people is a beaste of manye braynes. Sum men will mell with publique thinges, and those delite to hyer: Sum seeking welthie wydowes can with toyes set them on fyer: Sum can (like fishes in a truncke) kepe ould men for their paye: Manie by secret vserie, do crepe vp at this day. But be it so, that diuerse haue a diuerse trade, and waye: Doth any one well lyke his trade, one hole hower of the daye? No coaste of all the worlde I weane lyke Baiie towne of pleasure: Yet sayle the posting carles from thence, in hope to heape vp treasure. If (on goddes name) they ch?ge their place, whiche way those lurdans drawes, Th' artificers must beare theire tooles the carpinters their sawes. In wedlocke (Lorde) how he admyres the blesse of single lyfe? Unmaryed, he sweares him bleste, alone which hath a wyfe. What knot can hould this Proteus, that varies thus in hewe? The pore man What? merrie I hope he too muste chaunge his stew. His parler, and his bedchamber, Yea he will haue his barge As surlye as the ritche: a bote vpon his proper charge. Mecænas if I meete with the without my frisled top, Not notted fyne, and fashion lyke, thy mannour is to stop, And ieste at me: my cote is bare, my gawberdyne amis, Thou iestes at me: I maruaile muche what sport thou fyndes at this. If that my mynde were chaungeable, and were not alwayes one, Takinge, reiectinge, retakinge the fashions lefte, and gone Glowing in no state of my lyfe in steddie plighte, and sounde, Thou thinckes, and knowes me to be mad, but wilte not ieste at me In iuster case, as reason would: as farre forth as I see, Thou weneste that I do wante no leache, nor phisickes helpinge cure From pretor sente: nathles thou arte a buttres safe, and sure Of all my state, thou chafes at me for payring of my nayle Amisse, at me thy frinde, and eeke an hangeby at thy tayle. In fyne, suche follye fondes a man, and fondlye makes him roue: The wyseman a nes vnfalliblie, second to onelye Ioue. His owne man famouse mannerlye lastlye of kinges, a kinge. Healtheful in sowle excepte his corpes sum kynde of sicknes bringe. To Lollius. I haue perusde at Preneste him (frind Lollie greate of fame) That pende Troies broyles, whilste thou at Rome didste practyse to declame. Who, what proffits, whats good, whats bad, (and verye feelde doth slip) Dothe better tell, and more at full, then Crantor or Crysipp. Why I so thincke, (if leasure let) lende me thy listninge eare. The hystorye of Parys loue, (for which as we do heare Greate Greece empayred verye sore, which wreakinge Parys sinnes Did wayne awaye with ten yeares fighte prolongde by lingeringe twynnes) Of foolishe kinges and foolishe folke conteynes a fumishe flame. Antenor would haue compremize to cut awaye the same. What saies our Parys? what sayes he? compell him shall theire none To cease to bathe in worldlye blis, and flow in ioy alone. Duke Nestor sillie carkinge segge the tempeste to appease He cummes, and goes, twixte king of Agamenon men and awfull Achilles. The kinge for loue, both twayne for ire are in a chafinge fitte, What so the princes dote in lyfe, the commons smarte for it. Throughe treason crafte, mischiefe, and luste, through wrothe of stomacke stowte, Theye spare no sinne within Troye walles, nor none they spare without. Againe, how virtue, and a witte at all assayes can ease The Poet made a mirror in the wittie Vlixes. Who taminge Troye, the manors, and the cities wyselye viewd Of manye men: (for him and his whilste he through vaste sea rude, Did shape returne) who though he bore ful manye a bitter shower, Yet had the aduerse waues of him, no soueraintie, or power. Thou knowst y? mearemades sweete recordes, dame Circes charminge cup, Whereon if he like to the reste had once assayde to sup, Fylthie and fonde, a strumpettes slaue, subiecte to hir desyer Then had he bene, a dogge vncleane, and sowe, the frinde to myer. We are a sorte of lubbers, bred to helpe to eate vp corne, Righte wooers of Penelopie, knaues, Parasytes forlorne, A youth but to well practysed in makinge of a feste, To sleepe to twelue a clocke at noone, we thincke it but a ieste. And when as we are couchde in bed, we heare the minstrells play, With twanging of an instrumente, to chase our dumpes away. Theues ryse at all tymes of the nighte to murder, and to quell. Wilte thou not breake thy deathlyke sleepe, to kepe the sounde and well? If thou neglecte forecastinge still for to enioy thy health, Take heade, for dropsies breede of slowthe, all sodainlye by stealth. If at day breake with candle lighte, thou buskle not at booke, If thou to sum good exercyse, or studie do not looke, In loue, or malice shalte thou plunge, Yea, thoughe thou be awake. A little mote out of thyne eye why doste thou haste to take? If oughte there be that noyes thy minde moste parte thou arte contente Or thou begin to cure the same to seeke an whole yeare spente. The facte begun, tonehalfe is done, be wyse and take good harte: Begin: who so dryues of good deedes, he playes the farmers part, Who will not ouerslip the brooke whilste that the water fall. The water runnes, and kepes his course, and ever kepe it shall. Men seeke for moneie, and a wyfe, fruitfull, and freshe of hewe: The earth vndreste, with shredding share, the husbandmen subdew: He that hath once sufficient, let him wishe for no more: Not howse nor groue, nor yet of gould, or siluer ample store Can rid the owners crasie corpes fro fellon shaking feuer. Nor can the mynd of man from carke, (for al their vigor) seuer: That owner needes must healthfull bee, and other men excel, Which hauing riches competent, doth cast to vse theim well. The wisshinge, and the tremblinge chuffe his house and good doth please, As portraytures the poreblind eyes, as bathes, the gowtie ease. As musicke dothe delite the eares With matter stuffde, and sore. The vessels sowers what so it takes if it be fowle before Do, way delite, for pleasure bowghte with payne annoyes in th' ende. The Carle wantes aye, let thou thy drift to no excesse extende. Th' enuiouse foole doth pine away at others happie state, The tyrfants of Sicilia did finde nothing to grate Their gawles so much, as enuie did. who can not staie his ire Shall wishe vndone which teene bad do, and wilful fonde desyre. Ire is shorte wrathe, rule thow thy moode. if it do not obey, It rules forthwith, it thou with bitte, it thou with chaine must stay, The plyante steede of tender necke, the horsekeper doth tame, To marche forth lightly where him list: further, to proue the same, The hounde which doth commence his game with opening at the skin, Doth practise pursuite at the beast and length through ferne and finne. Then children leane your hartes to lore, the best thinges eeke imbrase What iuse (looke) first bemoysts a shel, the shel therof a space, A longe space wil reteyne the tast: But if thou slack or stay: Or if thou beist to forwerd ells, and run to fast away: I tarye for no trewands, I, which from their studies slacke, And those that wil vauntcurrers be Not I wil draw theim backe. To Iulius Florus. Florus, in what parte of the worlde Augustus sonne in lawe Duke Claudius doth warfayre nowe I trauaile much to know.

What doth our busye bende of Clarkes? to know it is my will. Who takes vpon him to indite Augustus, woorthy acts? Who powers into the worlde to cume his wise, and warlike facts? What Tytius? to Romane cost that shortlye cums to dwel. Who did not feare to drinke the drawghtes of Pindars hidden well.

I wishe you furthermore to write and written to me sende. What harte thou bearst to Munatie, if he be yet thy frend. If that thy frendeship soulderd ill, hath stayed no longer while: And if it now be knapte in twaine which I did reconcile. But, whether you hote stirring blood, or lacke of practise vex, Lyke beastes vnbroake, vnusde to toyle, Bruits of vntamed neckes, Sirrs, whersoeuer you do liue, me thinke it doth not well, To breake so straite a knot of loue: further I will not mell. I haue againste your home comminge a long deuoued cowe. Which graseth here within my groues and fattes her selfe for you. To Albius, Tybullus a deuysor Tybullus frend and gentle iudge of all that I do clatter What dost thou all this while abroade, how might I learne the matter? Dost thou inuent such worthy workes, as Cassus poemes passe? Or doste thou closelie creepinge lurcke, Amid the wholsome grasse, Addicted to Philosophie, contemning not a whitte Thats seemelie for an honest man, and for a man of witte? Not thou a bodie withoute breast, the Goddes made the t'excell In shape, the goddes haue lent the goodes, and arte to vse them well. What better thinge vnto her childe can wishe the mother kinde, Then wisedome, and in fyled frame to vtter owte his minde, To haue fayre fauoure, fame enoughe, and perfect staye, and health, Things trim at will, and not to feele the emptie ebb of wealth? Twixte hope to haue, and care to kepe, twixte feare and wrathe, awaye Consumes the time: eche daye that cummes thinke it the latter daye, The hower that cummes vnloked for shall cum more welcum ay. Thou shalt fynde me fat, and wel fed, as pubble as may be, And when thou wilt a merrie mate, to laughe, and chat with the. To torquatus If thou canst well vowtsafe to suppe with thin, and simple cheare, And eate thy potage holy vp, (a mease of homely geare) In skellet course: at sonsette then Torquat I tarrye the. Thou shalte cum home and helpe to drinke a cup of wine with me. Wine, prest in taurus consulship, twixt Sinuce, and Petryne, And merrie Mintorne, If thou hast sum better that is thine, Or pray me cum, or bid me cum, If thou wilt be my gest My chimney shines, myne householde stuffe, is hansumly vp drest. Do waye vaine hope, fowle strife for goodes and bablinge in lawe cases. The day licenceth sporte, and sleepe, To morrow Cesars graces Natiuitie assoyleth al, scotfree we may hould tagge, In frendly chat this sommers night, and let the worlde go wagge. A way with wealth, if that a man haue not a tyme to vse it: The niggarde to straite to him selfe, what doth he but abuse it? Who sekinge howe to benefite his heire in al he can, Doth well deserue the second roume, next to a frantike man. I wil go quaffe, and strew my flowres, In freshe and fragrant wise, And for a time wilbe contente not to be counted wise. What, doth not liuely drunkennesse? Dronkennes deepe secrets it bringes oute It confirmes hope, the naked man it makes in battaile stowte: It doth discharge the pensife minde, It teacheth artes a pace, Whom haue not fraighted goblettes made, to vtter with a grace? And eke in pinching pouertie made lowse at harte and free? This fit for me, I glad of it, this charge I take to me: A factor I to take good hede that table clothes be cleaue: The napkens fayre: leste sluttishnes do turne the gess to teene. That flagons and the vessels scourde do shew to the thy face. That what passeth through frend and frende go not oute of the place. Throughe pratlinge pyes: that like with like and mate may set with mate: Septicius,, and Brute withe the according to your state. Excepte Sabin per companie be bod to better cheare, He shalbe one? I take on me to compasse all this geare. There is a roume for shadowes to, as iesters, and for such: Unlesse the crowded company perfume the place to much. Write thou the number that wil cum, cum straight, and stay no more, And through sum posterne slip thou from thy clyent at thy dore. To Numitius Nowght to admyre Numitius is almost suche a thinge As can conserue a man in blesse and blesse vnto him bringe. Sum suche there be not once agaste which dare beholde the sonne, The starres, the tymes, from point, to point, how they do rowle and run, What thinke you of the goodly giftes, which in the earthe we finde? What of the sea, that ritcheth those of Arabie, and Inde. Plaies, triumphes (giftes of such as seeke with folke to haue a grace) How dost thou looke vpon this geare? what Censur, and what face? Who dreades the lacke, of such like thinges, in such sorte doth admyre, No doubt the same, as he that doth them feruently desyre. Both parties are distrubde with feare, both drenched in one cryke, The feare to lose, or not to haue, doth fray them both a like. Ioy he, sad he, wishe he, dread he, what matters that at al, If at all thinges which hee shal see better, or worse to fal Then hee hopd for, with powting lookes he glares vpon the grounde, Or els in bodie, and in minde be sicklie, and not sounde? The wyse man maye be counted mad, the rightuouse man vniuste, If he after virtue it selfe more then enough do luste. Goe now, and laye thy lookes vpon thy siluer, and thy goold, Thy marble statues, brasen woorkes, and Monumentes beholde. Past virtue since we maye not passe, this earthlye drosse admyre, Becum in loue with iewells, gemmes, and coloures cumd from tyre. Reioyse that thowsand eyes do gase on the, whilste thou doste talke, Take this with the from market place both late, and earelye walke Home to thy house: forcastinge that thy neghbour should haue more Wheate (by the dowrie of his wyfe) dehuskd vpon the flore: Let it greue the that sum man cumd of basse, and cowrser kynde, Shalbe admirde of the for wealthe, and thou owte of his mynde. Nothinge but virtue, nowghte but it, what s'euer lyes belowe Age will make seene, age will digge vp: and those thinges whiche we sowe Moste freshe, and sheene, age will attache Thoughe thou beeste famouse knowne In courte, of kinges, though throughe the streetes thy bruite abroade be blowne Remaynes to cum, to where all kinges and kesars haue bene drawne. If that thy sydes, or Renes becume With twitchinge stitche attainted, Seeke how to chase that griefe awaye to make it disaquaynted. Wouldste thou lyue well? who would not so? If onelye virtue can Procure such lyfe, vayne toyes resyne, sticke stowte to virtue then. The best marchandise is virtue.Thincke not that woords do virtue make, as trees do make a wood, Take ship betyme, leste sum forestal, and bye vp all this good: This pretiouse delytefull good, treasure of greater gaine Then all the chaffer that transfretes from Portugal, or Spayne. Disburce a thowsand talents thus, and then a thowsand moo, Three thowsand, and fowre thowsand thus for virtue let them go.

Philippe a famouse counsailor an hartie, and a stowte, Came from the hall at eighte a clocke to suppe, or there about. And beinge now an aged man and therefore not so stronge Complainde, that from the hall to home his iorney was so longe. And spyinge in a barbars shop a younge man in a chare At ease yplasde, who quyetlye his nailes did purge and pare: Sir boy ? he, goe learne, tell me, (the boy did streight obey) Who? whence he cam, what wealth, what fr?ds what parentes, and what stay? Goes, commes and brings him word, how that Vulteus was his name A prayser, hamsumlye to liue. Whom no man can defame. A speedie, and discret worker in bountie franke, add free, Fiew frendes, and commonly at home he vseth for to be. And when he hath dispatche himself, of busnes for that day, Then with a menny of his mates, a brode he goes to playe. This tale thus tolde Phillippus longde With Vulte himselfe to talke. And bad his boy incontinente backe to the shop to walke, To pray the younge man suppe with him, The page returnes againe: He halfe mistrustes the case, saithe he, and thankes me for the paine, But cannot cume: and as I gesse by vysage made to me, The horesonne eyther doth contempne, or feare to mell with the. Next day Philippus went to him and founde him sellinge geare: Ragges to the countrie rusticall. approching very nere Philippus firste saluted him: Vultie himselfe did purge, Because his busie bargaininge, so dayly did him vrge, That he ne came, and spake not first.

And comming to his iorneys ende he gan to maruaile sore, At Sauines pastures, at the ayre, and praysde it more, and more. Phillip he smyled in his sleeue, and hopeth more to smyle, Willing this Cokney to intrap, With this same merrie wyle: Hee geues to him seuen sextarcies, and promiseth seuen more To bye this ferme: with fayre swete wordes he egges the cockescome so That for to make the ambage shorte, and not to draw it on More then it needes, our cittizen is now a Corridon.

But when his gotes through ill disease, his sheepe decaid through theft, His corne deceaude his gredie hope, his oxe at ploughe dead left: Displeased w? his damagies, at midnight on a iade To Philippes house al sodainly hee posteth in abrade.

By thy good nature, thy right hande, and househould goddes therefore, Humblye I praye my former plighte to me pore wretch restore. He that doth se his owne offence how that he did retyre From better trade, and better things then those hee did desyer: Let him not shame, but streight returne with all possible spede, And willingly resume the trade, and life, which he did leade, This is from me the best aduise, that he is like to gett, Let eche man meysure out him selfe with his owne foote, and met.

I sayd most thinges that might auaile t'excuse me in this case, Yet was afrayde lest I should seme to much my selfe t'abbase By cloking myne habilitie: fit for my selfe alone. So I that from the greater vice so fayne would haue bene gone, Not to be thought an hypocrite deserue now to be named, In this my suite a citizen that is of nought ashamed, But if thou thinkeste it prayse woorthy that at my frendes request, I haue shakde of all shamefastnes, and bouldly done my best: Let him retaine vnto thy house, thou shalt finde him no doubte Aright good fellowe of him selfe, and for his corage stoute. To Fuscus Aretius I that admire the countrie soyle interely do wishe wel Fuscus to the, in cittye ay that likest so to dwel. In this thinge onely wee are founde vnlike in iudgmente others, In all thinges els wee tune in one as it were germaine brothers, The culuerdoues of auncient league the treweste twaine that bee, Are not in more consente of willes and hermony, than we. Thou kepes thy neste, the citie still, I loue on husshing brookes Of cuntrie gay, on mossie stones onmedes to caste my lookes. What wilte thou man I lyue I reigne since I resignde these toyes Which you aduance vp to the skyes with mighty rowting noyse. Lyke as the seruaunt that is vsde to course, and fulsome meate, Thinks it of small effect, or none on wafer cakes to eate: So I woulde haue good cuntrie cheare my nature to suffice, Your iunkets, and your delicates, of truth I do dispyse. If men must lyue accordingly as nature dothe them call: And if a plotte for howseroume muste be sowght for, first of all: The cuntrie didst thou euer know and place of better blisse? Is there, where wynters bitter breths more tollerable is, Where more coole ayre doth temperate the dogges starre stewing rage? Or doth the lyon in his course more beninglie aswage. When furiouse he hath receaude the traueld prickling sonne? Is there, where slepe throughe rankerouse care is lesse then here vndone? And do the erbes I pray you worse delite the nose, and eye: Then Lybique stones, or what so ells the citie setteh by? Where doth there purer water throughe the leaden conduyts glyde, Then that which in the fawling streame with murmur, swete doth slyde. The cittie eke lyke cuntrie townes to haue theire fruite, and flowers Builde pillors to support their trees their orchardes, and grene bowers In cittie to, do we not saye that building is the beste Whose prospect serue to see the fieldes more fitly then the reste? The citizens thinkes nature base, and arte is their desier. Tushe, expulse nature with a forke yet she will still retire, But chefely, if that she be euill she tarries then no space, The victris hath a swifte recourse by stealthe vnto her place, The man that can not wel decerne but vseth still to buye For Sidon silke, a wullen webb of wateringes forged dye, Hath not like losse, nor yet like greefe to grate him on the gall, As he which twixt falshoode,, and truthe cannot decerne at al. Who so was to much rauished and to much ioy did take In flow of wealth, him chaunge of flow yea to much shall yshake. Make it awaye what s'euer it be thou ginnes for to admire. Flye greate doings: aboue all thinges seeke not for to aspyer: Well may one passe in cotage pore the princes and their peares In true and perfect libertie and see more pleasante yeres. FableAn hart the better cheuailer as it came then to passe Did chase an horse that fed with him from eating of the grasse. The horse that alwaye went to worse besowghte the helpe of man. The man he takes him vp with spurres and bitt, in al he can. The tryumpher after that he was parted from his foe The man from backe, the bitt from mouthe he could not rid them fro. So, he that feareth pouertie his fredom cannot houlde. Fredome, better then mettells all better then choysest goulde. That foole shall beare in dede a Lorde, and lyue a dayly thrall, For that he will not knowe to vse and lyue vpon a small. The state of men, if it for them bee not accordinge fitte, Is like a shoe, or els a shoe is verie like to it: The shoe thats greater then the fote will make the fall or trip, The lesser shoe doth hurt thy foote (for pardie it will nip.

Collected coyne is Lord or lowte to eche possessinge man, More worthy to cum after him constrained with a cord, Then that it shoulde so haue the heade, and leade the lowtishe Lorde. Behind Dame Ceres ruinnouse churche I dighted these to the In all pointes verie well appaied but that thou wast from me. To Bullatius How haue theie Bullate pleased the Chios, and Lesbos knowne?

Peopled, or not, to liue euen there I would be very fayne, For gittinge myne and I of them to be forgot againe. Wher I may see, and safely see Neptune of dreadfull name, How he at wil the waltering waues doth oft controule, and tame. But he that postes from Capua to Rome mucke weete with myer, To rest him all day in his In is not that mannes desyer: Nor he that lately hath catchde coulde the stewe, and baine doth prayse, As thinges that fullie make a man happie at all assaies. If thou beest tost vpon the sea with Sowth wynde pusant fell, Thou wilt not yonte Aegæum sea. sell all thou hast, and dwell. We trauaile all, not all a lyke, I trauaile to remaine: Thou here to catche, and ther to snatche dost go and cum againe, What is Rhods to content a man or Myttelene the gaye? A warme furde freese coote on thy backe vpon a summers day. A linnine slop in spitting snowe, in wynter, Tyber fludde, In hote August a nosehighe fyer wil do the as much good. Whilste we are lustie, and fortune doth kepe her frendly cheare, At Rome praise Chios, and Samos and Rhods that lyes not neare. Apprende with greatfull hande eche hower that god hath lente the here: Thinges pleasant now for to be done deffer not for a yeare. To wher soeuer thou dost cum or what hap thou dost fynde, Thou maist lyue ther, if that thou wilt, with a contented mynde: If by wisedom, not well dight house our cares are al vndone, If those chaunge weather, not their wit, which yont the sea do run. Our dilligence hath littell skill we far and neare do skip, To purchase wealthe in euery coaste in wagon, and by ship. The worste place here as pleasaunte is as that which thou wouldste fynde, If thou hadst grace, to iudge a right, and qualefie thy minde. To Iccius. On Agrippes goodes in Sicilie which thou hast in thy hande, If (Iccie) how to vse them well thou wouldest vnderstand, I cannot see how Ioue himselfe coulde geue the better store. Do waye therefore thy practysde plaintes, bemone thy selfe no more. For he that hath the vse of goodes, cannot be iudged poore. If that thy bellie, sydes, and feete, and all thy partes be well, Not wealth of kinges can adde to owght that doth this wealth excell. If that midst all these present goodes, thou bibliste not at wine, But arte contente with erbes and rootes to set the downe and dyne: This dare I say thou lyuest harde, to get the coine in houlde. That fortune liquide ryuer straighte might turne the into goulde. Or, that moneye should seme to chaung, thy nature but a small, Or that thou dost thinke abstinence surmountinge pleasures al. It is no maruaile if that he let bease eate vp his corne, Whilste that his mynde contemplatinge, on pilgramage was borne: For thou this drosse, vneasefull drosse doste sette but little by, No small wyseman, as it shoulde seeme, thou hast thy mynde on hye. What stayes the seas from drowning all. what orders all the yeares: If planettes meue them selues, or els are wrounge aboute in spheres: Why is the moone now bright now darke, what to hir roundnes bringes: What meanes, what doth the great conflict, the striuing peace of thinges: Empedocles, or Sartyues pate, which of the twaine dothe dote: Thus arte thou ofte tymes occupied, or shouldest be I wote. Fishe, garlicke, onions what it be, thou vseste for to eate: I praie the of thy coortesie do Grosphus well intreate. Thers not the thinge that is not good that he will of the craue, The good man hath the fieweste frindes, when he moste needes to haue. Leaste thou beeste ignoraunte what is as now our Romanes state, The folke of Bisca, by Agrip, th' Armenianes, of late, By Nero were discumfited: Phraates tooke his mace, Kneeling vppon his marribones, to Cesars aufull grace. The goulden Lady plentie hath. let fal out of her horne Such store of graine, as Italie hath seldom had like corne. To Vinnius Asella As I haue taughte the longe and oft when thou for me shouldest ryde, Thou shalte presente to August hand my bokes in clawsure tyde: (Asell) presente them vnto him, if thou hast markde those thre That he is well: that he is glad: and asked for them from me, Be not to rashe on my behalfe, it wil disgrace the gifte, If thou beeste to officiouse a profferer to swift. If that my booke be burthenouse shift the of it be tyme Least thou ass lyke vnloden the with greater note of cryme: Then will they laughe at Asina thy fathers right sirname, On the his sonne, the common voice will then bestowe the same: More meete to beare through cliftes, &amp; fluddes and puddills (wil they saye) Then here in courte in mannishe shape the Asses part to plaie. Thy purpose once accomplished, arryued at the porte, Thou must retaine thy bookishe charge in hansum ciuil sorte: Not as the lambe vnder the arme the sheppard doth reteine: Or drunken Pyrrhe beares her wool her flycesie filched gaine. Or as the drunken dissolute doth prate his cap in hande. And bragge not to the companie that shall abowte the stande, That thou hast swet, and taken paines. in bringinge of such geare, As will embaite our Cesars eye, and tickle vp his eare. I pray the hartly to take paines, (good Asell) do thy beste, Auaunte, adew, take hede to trip, and breake not my behest. To his Balie in the Countrie. Balie, the baliue of my firme, which maketh me so glad, Which thou contemnest daintelye and demeste very badde, My ferme of fiue faire families, which once was wunt to haue Fyue Senators frome Baria, men credible and graue. Balie, I saye let the and me in this one point compare, Or thou canste plucke more thornes from field or I from minde more care. Whether the landes lord, or the lande shalbe more trim, and gaie. Although the pensife pietie of Lamia do me staie, Who comforteles his brothers deathe a mourner doth lament, Yet th'itherwarde assuredlye my harte, and mynde is bente. And burnes, and burnes to braste the bondes which doe inclose it so, That it ne can goe scope abrode where it woulde gladly goe. I thincke the countrie, thou the towne, to make a man of blisse: He that doth lyke an others lote his owne condempned is. Both fooles alyke, without respecte the countrye we do blame Our minde the cause in ficklenes Which euer is the same. A Citizen, in secret wyse thy farme thou dost desyer: A farmer, thou the townish games doste burne for, hote as fyer. Thou knewste me to be still one man much pensife ay to be When myne vnwelcum busines to cittie draweth me. We loue not one thinge thou and I, and therfore disagree. Those places which thou thinkeste rude erksum, and desolate, A man of myne opinion thinckes pleasaunte: and doth hate Things gaie to the: the vitlinge house doth bring thy stomake downe And eggeth on thyne appetyte to cum into the towne. And that my grounde, incense, and rather then grapes doth beare: And for because to whittle the the tauerne is not neare: And that thou hast no trippinge trull to mince it with the now That thou mighst foote it vnto her as nimble as a cow. The glebie fielde, and clottrie glebe with mattocke thou must tame: Yoke the wylde neat, and with burthens of fother feede the same. The ryuer turnes the to a toyle, if that a raine do fall, Thou must go learne to make a dam to saue thy meade with all. Now harke, and marke on my behalfe what maketh vs to square. I that did shine in silken sutes and glitter in mine haire, I that coulde make the wylie shiftes scotfre to liue in pleasure: I that in time, and out of time karoust it without measure: Now me to fede on simple cheare it is a heauenly hap: And swetely by the husshing brookes to take a snurting nap. Not any there with waywarde eyes for my good lucke shal spyte me, Or poison me through secret grudge or bitterly backbite me, The innocentes the countrye clownes when they see me vnfitte Upturning cloddes, their harme is this, theill stande, and lawghe at it. The carpintor dothe grudge and thinke thy state to be to good, And that thou hast to much of neate, or orchard, fruite and woode, The sluggishe oxe doth wishe to beare the caple for to draw: I wolde wishe all with good intente to vse the art they knowe. To Valla. Yt were but well that I should cum, that thou shouldest writ to me What winter nowe at Velia, what wether there mihbt be At Salerne towne: what countrye folke, and eke what kinde of way. For Musa the phisicion, tould me this other day, That Baiæ was not now estemde as it was once in price. They hate me ther at Baiæ of late in greuouse wise, For that I vse in winter tyme to bathe me in such baynes As be not warmie like to theires, nor so aslake my paynes. The place is full of mertle tries: and many a holsom lake, Of brimston, good to cure the gowte, of truth I did forsake. All Baiæ murne, and grudge to see the sickmen, and the sore, How eche doth bathe him selfe els where, and commeth there no more. The place is chaungd, y? Innes are chaungde the horses they go by, And no man now to Cumæ, or to Baiæ doth hye. The people they do shun the towne, the horses must obey, Guyded by twyning of the bitt vnto their maysters paye. I pray you also wryte to me the nature of that grounde, Or this, or that, to fede the flocke more plentifull is founde. If that their water in the poules and cesternes closely stande: Or if it sweetly bubble throughe the siluer channeld sande. As for the wynes that you haue there I force not on them I How s'euer it be in country towne I loue it by and by. But when I cum to seadyke syde then do I hope to drinke Lyuely, and myldlie rellesde wynes, wine that will wake one thinke Of cherie thinges, and that will flushe into my mynde, and vaines, Assuringe me, that I shal be a man of ample gaines. Wine that will make me speake in tune, to prattle with a grace, Wyne that will make my paramoure esprysed on my face. Of haires, and bores wryte vnto me, which soyle hath better store, Of sea fishe, and of dainty fishe which country hath the more. That I may cum brawne fed from thence; This write thou vnto me: So meete it is, as also meete that I should cum to the, When as with spence of parentes goddes Sir Meui once began, Mongst lustie laddes for to be cawld a iolly gentleman: The wandring varlet that knewe not oft tymes where he should goe Undynde, and had not wit to knowe his true frende from his foe, Cunning to speake all kinde of speache against all kinde of men, Th' vndoer tempest, and the hell of al the shambles then, What s'euer hee coulde get, or scrape his appetyte to staunche He gaue it all to gratifie, his gredie gutted paunche. When from his wicked dasterde mates he coulde but littel wype, Then like an horse he woulde deuowre a chitterling, or trype, And as a man halfe mortified, of god he woulde desier, That all the glottons wastefull wombes were brent with flaminge fyer. When he had got sum greater praie, and turnde it all to dust, I maruaiie not (by God) quoth he If many men do luste To eate good things, what thinge is lyke amorsell of good meate: The Turtle, and a peece of souse, no better thinge to eate. Suche one am I, thinges smal and safe mine vse is for to praise. In ebb of wealth, agaynst the ebb my courage sterne doth paise. In dainty flowe of happie tyde I thinke you onlye wise, To bathe in blysse aboue the rest and lyue in cyuill guyse, Which haue the fermes, and manners fayre, with goulde the pragged purse, Rents and reuenewes standinge firme. at all tymes to disburse. To Quintius. Qvintye in that thine ofte demaunde make thou no further suite, If that my grounde feede me wyth corne or wyth the oliue fruit. With aples, mede, or propping elmes that clad with vinetrees be, The fashion of my feelde shalbe at large sett out to the. Adioyninge hilles, except they be with darkesum dale vndun: But so that on the right syde still doth shine the rysing sonne: Or left syde the declining sonne that doth the fieldes surview: The temprature is laudable: Naie, what if this be true? The oke trees ayde the herde with maste the herdes man with muche shade. Well might thou saye that freshe Tarent were brought into this stounde? The well may well be calde a streame that springeth in my grounde. Hebrus that meteth Thracia, coulder nor purer is To cure the heade, to cure the wombe it runneth holsom, this The dulcet dues in September, if thou darst credit me, Make me to cum gainst winter still so healthfull vnto the. Thou lyuest well, if thou wilt seeke for to fulfil thy fame. At Rome we all haue geuen to the of blessednes the name. I feare it thoe, thou dost beleue more others then thy selfe, And puttest not in wysedom blysse, but in sume baggage pelfe. If many say thy sickly corpes to be at healthful staye, To please those many thou wilt feast, and reuel al the day: Hyding thyne ague, whilst it cum, and shake thy trembling armes: Lewde shamefastnes of foles it is to hyde their propper harmes. If one shoulde oft record to the thy workes by lande and seas, And by this language should assaye thyne emptie eares to please: Greate loue knowes not, in whose sole handes thou and thy cittie be, If that thou loue the people more and they loue better the. Canst thou impropriate to the Augustus worthy praise? Or wilt thou lete them cal thee wyse reformde at al assayes? Per frendship canst thou answere to so burthenouse a name? Both thou, and I, I thinke it so would gladly haue the same. He that gaue these great names to me, and tytles now to day, To morrow if it pleaseth him, may take the same awaye. The people geues, and takes awaye, the case is very badd: I laye them downe, yet for my parte I meane not to be sadde. If they shoulde me dispoyle of fame, and burthen me with theft, And sweare that I my parentes lyfe with rope had erste bereft: Byte me with thousande infamies, shoulde I my cheare estraunge? False tytles please, false slaunders fray, and many men do chaunge: Whome? none but lyers and the lewde. who is, a goodman? who? He that can kepe the fathers lawes, their acts, and statutes to. Who doth abridge longe suite, and stryfes that cum into his hande: And by whose suertiship, contractes in perfect state do stande. But what if al the howse, and streete do know him full of sinne, Fayre hewde without, obseruing lawes, and filthie fowle within? I haue not stolne nor run awaye a seruaunt sayes to me. He is not bette (what would he more) not beatinge is his fee. I haue not slayne: thy hanged fleshe the rauens shall not fatte, I am thriftie, a good husband: his mayster grauntes not that. The crafty wolfe suspectes the trappe, the gosshawke feares the snayre, The puttocke from the bayted hooke, her knabling neb will spare. The good hate vyce for that they loue vertue with all their harte. The wicked they hate wickednes, for feare of further smarte. In case thou walke pretensedly, and thereby hope to gaine, Thou shalte becum for to confounde thinges holly, and prophaine. If thou purloynst one mette from out a thousand mette of beanes, My losse is lesse, thy facte not lesse in this thy filchinge meanes. An Ipocryte whom all the world for holly lyfe admyres, When he doth offer oxe, or hogge, in sacrificing fyers, He speaketh t'Appollo, and Ianus that all men may it heare: But muttreth in his mumbling lippes an other kinde of geare. Lauerna Dame of trecherie with crafte inspyre thou me, That I may seame an vprighte man, an holy one to be: Beduske my fraude withe cloudes, my sinnes Induce on theym a night. And let me seme to be in lyfe a leminge lampe of light. What better is the couetouse, what then a slaue more free? He for a dodkin that will ducke, In fayth I do not se. He that will couet greedely, he that wilbe afraide: That such an one is fre in dede, no man shall me perswade. His armes are loste, he hath forsoke of manlines the stounde. Who hasting to aduaunce him selfe is daunted to the grounde. If one may sell his prisoner, Couetus what wise man would him slay? He may do seruice very good, that may he by my fay. He may plowe, sayle, and winter to amid the salt sea fome: He may beare owt, bring into vs, prouyde for thinges at home. The goodman, and the man thats wise is euer boulde to say, VViseman Penthus thou gouernour of Thebes, what dost thou on me laye? Gouernor What shal I beare vnworthelie? Ile take thy goodes from the VViseman What goddes? my substance, syluer, beddes? take al those goodes to the. Gouerner With gyues, and fetters Ile tame the vnder a galow dyre VViseman But god (I hope) wil reskewe me, at mine instant desyer. Perceauinge this, death on my backe, streight forth the tyraunt bringes: That is his worst: death is the last and vtter line of thinges. To Saeua Thoughe Seua thou arte wise enoughe, and by thy selfe canst tel In euery kynde of coortesie to vse thy betters wel, Yet further learne the iudgement of a very frende of thine, As if the blinde to him that sees his footestep should assigne: Yet marke it thoo if thow canst cull owght frome these wordes, I saye, That thou maist take vnto thy selfe, and after beare away. If gratefull ease, if profounde slepe, be such thinges, as do please the, If crackling cartes, if tauernes no yse, if stiffling dust disease the: Auoyde the towne, and goe abrode. Not he doth liue the best, That hath the most. In cittie sure is not the ioyful rest: Nor he lyues ill that oft times semes to lyue but base, and vyle. A much poore man doth liue oft beste, and doth the world begyle. If thou wouldst seeke to pleasure thyne, and well thy selfe demeane, Wayte on an inche vpon the churle, attyre thee neate, and cleane. Not Cynicus (? Aristip,) with colewoorts neede haue dynde, If he him selfe a seruitor to princes had resynde. Not Aristip (? Cynicus) himselfe woulde had resynde A seruitor to princes, if with worts he coulde haue dynde. Which of these twaine hath better spoke? or tell, or learne of me. I would iudge Aristippus taunte the better for to be. For he the sharpe Diogenes deryded in his kinde: Thou art (? he) a common cokes, I to my selfe do fynde Good pastime to, the better myne and eke more noble glee: I plaie my part to ryde alofte that kinges may pamper me. Thou askes vyle things, and art much worse then he that to the gaue, Though thou pretende to stande no neade at any man to craue. All huie, all state, all kynde of life did Aristip besette. Seekinge the best, yet well appaied with that, which he coulde gett. Againe, wise meeke Diogenes much would I maruaile I, If he to sum ciuilitie himselfe coulde now applye. Not Aristippu would desier in purple to bee cladd: In all places he gladly ware apparell good, or bad: And could eche kinde of personage so gaily on him take: The Cynecke hates a purple weede warse then a dogge or snake Or he would weare a suite of silke, the winter should him kil: Well geue him cloth, and let the foole goe like a Cockescome still. To conquer Realmes, and at the Carre the Captyues for to to leade, Doth touche Ioues throne, an heauenly thing a loftie praise in dede. To please those in authority, is not the meanest prayse: Not eche mannes chaunce, to Corinthe town to saile the moystie wayes. Sum will not mell, distrustinge how their seruyce should take place: And is it not a manlie act to get the princes grace? Or such, or none in these our dayes do beare away the bell, Sum feele their owne vnablenes, and do abhor to mel With burdens toto ponderouse, to heuie for theire backe. An other vndertakes all thinges and of himselfe doth cracke. But if that vertue be a thinge, and not an idle name, Experience deserues the braunche the prince of all the game. Those that speake least of pouertie, in talking with the king, Oft tymes speede best, and all day sene, the more awaye do bringe, Gettinge and catching differ muche, to gett and gette no shame, That is the heade of our good hap, the fountayne of our fame. My Sister hath no dowre at all my mother lackes her meate, My lande is nought for to be soulde, Nor good to kepe my neate: This is an open beggerie: An other he doth cracke, If he had where to do with all no frende of his should lacke. If that the Crow could feede in whishte, not creake nor make adoe, She might haue better cheare by muche. lesse grudge and brabling too. Per company thou rydest abroade to Brunduis, or Tarente, Of craggie waye, of stormes, or could he that doth him repente: He that for paine, or damagies, or fayned lossies wailes, Is lyke the strumpats impudent, talkde of in poetts tales. Who morne so oft for want of chaines, for want of fayre attyre, That none at length will trust there teares, when they would most desier. That cripple that doth ofte delude, (when his dyceite is spyed) Must goe on foote, whome many men did suffer for to ryde. Though he shoulde vaper into teares, and sweare vpon the same: Trust me in sadnes, take me vp, haue pittie on the lame. His neighboures all will crie at once: sum costomer els craue To spede your turne: we knowe your neede, we know you for a knaue. To Lollius Francke Lollio if I knowe the well. thou wilt be muche afraide, Professing the a frend, to plaie the ribbalde at a brade. The minion, and the matrone chaste do differ: (that is true) Faythles ribbalde, and faythfull frend, be things of dyuers hewe. This vyce hath to his contrarye, almost a greater vyce, Rude dumpishnes, vnmannerlye, offensyue, and precyse: Set forthe with rugged, scraped hyde, and teethe, as blacke as geate. Whilst it would seme a mere franchyse, instalde in vertues seate. Uirtue is meane, of vyces twaine, from both disseuerde plaine. An other is to proue, and preste, to play the slaue for gaine. A iester at the meaner sorte the ritchmans becke, or sounde He feareth so, retreates his wordes, and helpes them at rebounde: As if to crewell scholemaster a childe should lattin saye, As if a vyce should counterfeate sum other in the playe. An other vseth brablarie, for very gotish wol, Wyth tryfles fencd indede sayth he, or any man should pull My name from me, or shoulde me let to speake my conscience fre, I would not lyue duke Nestors lyfe, in suche case for to be. Caster, or Docill I may doubt, which can the better plaie. And eke debate to Brunduis towne which is the redie way, Whome harmefull loue, whom hurtful dyce haue sodainelye made bare: Whom pryde, and pompe, aboue his state hath trickde and trimmed fayre: Whom greedie thrist and knawinge pyne of siluer, and of goulde: Shunning, and shame of pouertie who so that they do houlde: Him hates the ritchman, that ritcheman, doth hate him dedely sore, That hath himselfe of vyces vyle ten tymes more deadlie store. He hates him, or will kepe him downe, and lyke the godly dame, Would haue him wiser then him selfe, of more deserued fame. And telles him to his owne great shame a very lickly tale. Uylan matche not thy selfe with me my welthynes will quale, And qualifie my foolishnes, and with the same dispence. Ha done compare no more with me, for why thou lackes the pence. A narrow gowne maie him content, that is of humble witt. Geue fooles the welth, wisemen the neede for they can beare out it. Euirapelus his enemies to troble and annoye, Would geue them gallant gawdie geare, who flushde with pusant ioye, Woulde take newe hope, and newe conceits with their new garmentes gaie. Set more by whor edom then wedlocke slepe all the lightsum day: Laye monie out to vserie when it is rowsed thence, Becum at length for to professe the noble art of fence. And being flitted from his strengths to impotence, and teene, Is glad to driue the gardners iade, ourwhart the country grene. Searche not to knowe the pryuie driftes, of any frende of thyne. Kepe counsaile close, though thou best wrunge with hastie wrath, and wyne. Commende not thyne owne practises, nor other mennes disprayse. When one would haue the hunt abrode, thy poemes do not blase. This grounde of stryfe did Amphion, and Zethus twinnes deuyde, Till Amphion of brotherhoode did lay his harpe asyde. Yelde the t'obbeye the easye rule, of him that is of mighte. As oft as thou shalt leede a feelde, with nettes a charged sighte: A sight of bangle eared houndes, rise thou, and lay adoune Thy conference with bokishe muse and let the shrewe goe frowne, That thow maist feede yfeare, vpon thy hardly purchasde praye. For those of Rome a goodlye toyle, good for thy name (I saye) For life, and limmes confortityue, for the in health the more That dost in course surpass the hounde, in strength excel the bore. Who can then the more semelely thy manlike armoure weelde. Oft hast thou wun with ioye of prease at gamminges in the fielde. A childe, thou knewst both warre, and campe, thou wanste thy spurres in Spayne With him that browght standerdes of Parths into their roumes againe. With him, who if that any thinge vnconquerd be behinde, With pruice of the Romane route to win it hath assynde. And least thou hyding of thy selfe excusses should be founde. (How beit) I thinke thou dust attempt nothing but iust and sounde) Sumtymes thou tryfles out thy time within thy fathers grounde. The Oste deuydes their bargies, and the water scrymage then (Thou beinge guyde) in foishe guyse is playde by youthely men. Thy brother foe, the fludd at hande, the fielde harde by the towne, You stryue whilst that swift victorie, one of the twayne doth crowne. If August knew that thou his warre resemblest in thy plaie, He would prayse the with clapping handes frendly I dare well saye. Further for to admonishe the (If therof thou standst neede) What, of what men, to whom thou speakste, take euer earnest heede. A groper after nouelties, in any wise do flye. I warrante the learne this of me the same's a verye pye. Nor wyde ope eares the thinges of trust can well conceale at all, And word once scapde, away its gone, and none can it recall. The maide, or wife that doth soiorne within thy neighboures dore, Let her not wounde thyne harte with loue or thrill thyne intralls sore. Lest that the husband of the wife, and master of the maide, Do turne thy hoped ioy to paine, and make the ill appaide. Beware, take hede, take heede, bewayre whom thou for good dost name, Lest haplie his misdeedes at length do shent thy face with shame. Sumtimes we erre, and do defende a much vnworthie man: The giltie partie once deceaud defende no further then. Speake for thy frend, thy long knowne frend, if slaunder him assaye: And beare, and boulster oute the good which on thyne ayde doth staye. For if with Theons venom tothe all gnawde aboute be hee, The hasserdes that are comminge next wil cum most nere to the. The case is thyne, thy neighboures house when it doth flame vp bright, And burninges thowght but smal, or now haue grown to dreedful might. Then whilst thy ship doth kepe a flote ydauncinge on the plaine, Take hede lest sodaine chaunge of winde do beare the backe againe. Sad nature, hates the pleasaunt head, the pleasant heade the sad: The swift likewise do hate the slowe, the slowe the swift to bad. The tiplinge sottes at midnight which to quaffe carowse do vse, Wil hate the if at any tyme to pledge them thou refuse. Though thou dost sweare, that thou dost feare the rumes that cum by night. Be perte, and cleare in countinaunce not malipert, and light. Sumetimes the sober man is thought the most dunce in the toune: And he that locketh vp his lippes is taken for a clowne. Chifely confer with learned men, peruse eche lettred booke: That how to liue a quyet life thou maist consult, and looke, Lest pore, and nedie couetyse do euer make the itche: Or drede or hope of thinges that make a man but manelie ritche. If vertue springe by litterature, or ells by natures gift, What quencheth care, what can the bring to constancie, and thrifte? What makes full contentacion? honor, or dulcet wealth, Or secret trade, or pryuat lyfe, which stalkes away by stealth. O Lollie frende, what do I thinke, what thinkes thou? do I say When I of any ioyllie ioy or pleasure do assaye: God graunte that I this kinde of life, though sumwhat wurse may finde: (If of my life the goddes wil haue remayninge sum behynde) God sende me once my commons cleare, of Bookes abundaunt store: This is enoughe to pray to god that geues and takes away, God geue me lyfe, and wealth and I will set my lyfe at staye. To Mecænas. Mecænas if thou darst beleue thine auncient frend Crætyne, No kinde of verse can longe be lykde that was not write in wine. Bacchus doth make the poets raue, like woddishe goddes, and wilde: In dawne of daye haue smelt of wyne the maiden musies mylde. Dan Homer for that he so much in prayse of Bacchus could, Is proude to be a frend of wine: yea Ennius the oulde Did neuer prease to puffe abrode the feates of battaile fyne, Except he were first whitled well and warmed through with winne To thrifty men that had not druncke graue matters he did leaue: The sober sorte of poetrie he did forsothe bereaue. Ennie said this, they did not misse but practysde it full well, All nighte to sprall and stryue with wyne, all day on it to smell. But what though one with face austere, with naked feete, and bayre, Should Cato counterfeate, and in his gallowes rounded hayre, Soould he be like to Catos self in life and vertue then? He brast him selfe, that would be thought equal to Timagen In gesture, voyce, and eloquence. Sum follow so precyse A learned man, that oftentymes they imitate his vyce. If I should say at certeine times I vsde for to be wann, Sum would wax pale with slibber sauce. sum imitating man. O imitators seruyle beastes how haue your tumultes vyle Full oftens rasde my collor vp, and oftens made me myle. I euer set my fotestepps fre, princelike where none had gone, But others groundes I haue not vsde to presse my fote vpon, Who hathe corage, and confidence shall rule an hooste the best. Licambes hanged himselfe for griefe conceyued through Iambick verses vvritten against hym.Th' Iambiquæ verse to Italye I shewde before the rest. Archilocus his rymes and spryts I followde at an inche: Those wordes, and matter that so sore Licambes once did pinche. And least you shoulde my poets heade with lesser leaues adorne, For that I feare the measure, and his art of verse to turne: The mannishe Sappho, and Alcæus temper the same mans muse In other feete: this drifte, and soune they both twaine did refuse. Alceus seekes no stepfather whom he with verse may blacke, Nor doth not make with rayling ryme his spouse hir necke to cracke. I, the romishe musicion set forth to lattin lande, This author, namde in no mannes mouth, nor borne in any hande. It doth mee good to heare him bringe things neuer brought before, To see him redde with ientle eyes in eche mans hande ybore. If thou wilt know why in him selfe, the reader much vnkinde Allowes my workes, and yet abrode doth blemishe in them fynde: I seke not for the fletinge voyce of foolke, with making cheare, By suppers, or to get the same, by dole of castinge yere. Not I that reade the noble bokes, can so becum the lowte, To craue grace at the grammer trybes in pewes to seeke them out. Hence cum these teares, this mortall spyte they haue against my verse: I am ashamed on pompose stage (say I) for to rehearse My wrytings, (wrytings nothing worthe) to seme to add a weight To tryflinge things, and things in dede of very slender sleight. Tushe man, sayth one, you meane to kepe your tricksie, dainty geare, To exhibit for worthines to Ioues good graces eare. Faire to thy selfe, thow dost suspecte al other to be sower: And thinkes thy selfe the hunnie sucke of poemes to out power. Reply do I, the iudgement sharpe of curious wittes I feare, And that they shoulde for very spyte my penned poems teare. The Theator I cannot like I crye, and aske delaie. Faine would I not begin at al so perillouse a plaie. For plaie ingenders tremlinge stryfe, and strife outraginge ire: Owtraging ire, fell spyteful lyfe, it, deathlyke battel dyre. The seconde Booke of Q. H. Flaccus his Epistles. To Augustus Since thou sustaines such busines and so much bringste abowte, Defends the Itale realme wyth armes, with mannors sets it out, Reformes with lawes: I shold but do the common wealth much wrong, If I shoulde stay thy well spente time, Cesar, with talking long. Both Romulus, and God Bacchus, Pollux, and Caster to For valiante feates of chiualrie Saintes shryned longe ago, Whilst they made their abode on earthe Emongste vs mortal men, Stayde warres, built townes, and laide out fieldes, they much compleined then, That honor such so plawsible, did not ensew their acts, As they did thinke they had deserud by merits and their factes. HerculesHe that did crowse, and culpon once Hydra of hellish spyte, And monsters knowne with fatall toyle to fetters frusshed quyte, Perceaud this by experience, that Monsters all do fall Through manlines: enuie is tamde at death, or not at all. He burnes the most with very blase, that all thinges brings to passe With skil, and none loues him, till he be lapde in leaden masse. Auguste, to the now present here, we present honors due, And alters make to thy greate name, by that name we sweare true, That anye thinge in anye place was neuer lyke to the: And dare auer, and well auouche that neuer none shalbe. The romishe people wise in this, in this point only iust Before the Grekes, and Romane guydes prefer the as they must. In this case doumes men very good, in that they iudge of the: In other thinges me thinks they seme not so vpright to be. Hating, and lothinge all such works, as lewde, and ful of crymes, Which were not fetchde from forren landes, or pende in all theire tymes. Such fawters of antiquitye that tables made be men, Deuysed and auctorished by well knowne Romanes ten, The storyes, and the iestes of kings reiestred longe before, Relegiouse bookes, and Cronicles, by prophets writ of yore: These workes they say the musies once in Albane mount did tell. Nedes must they cum from mouthe of muse, for they so much excell. The workes of Greekes as they be ould so if they be the best, So let vs iudge of Romaine woorkes and then is all at rest. Then chawke is cheese, and night is day plaine speaking is to stut, Within the Olyue nowght is hard, nowght hard without the nut: Wee then haue taken vp our stande, and cum to fortunes tip. But since we paint, and singe as well wrastle as well, and skipp As doth the Grecians pickd for nonce, as good in any game. Why shoulde we then in poetrie distrust t'attayne the same? If tyme do make mens poems good as it doth make good wyne, Then would I know how many yeares a poet do assyne. The wryter that departed hence an hundred yeares agoe, Emongst the poets new, or ould, where shal we place him (lo?) Mongste good, or bad: In sadnes nowe to exclude all brabling moode, How many winters do you wene will make a poet good. H'is ould, and good that hath bene deade an hundreth yeres complete. And he that lackes a yeare, or monthe where shall he haue his seat? Emongst the poets auncient, whom all men do approue: Or mongste that trybe which we reiect, and neuer age shall loue? He takes his place amongst the olde the case is very cleare, If he cum short of his accoumpt but one monthe, or one yeare. I take it thus Our Rome sayth to that one yeare breedes no square. Then lyke as one from horses taile should twitche out heaire by heaire, I take out one, and then one yeare subtracting one, by one Whilste he deceaude shall well perceaue the hundred to be gone: Who going to his cronicles doth iudge all rymes by time, And excepte death hath hallowed it allowes no kynde of ryme. Ennie wyse, stronge, and as he thoughte an other Homere he, Of the which dome concerninge hym (yet dyuers other be) Coulde not performe his promis tho lyke Homere to indyte Though he wende he had Homers sowle and euen as well could wryte. Neuie he is not in our handes his want doth vex our minde, So sacred be the poets oulde and Rome to them so kynde. If it be askd who was the beste: Pacuuius doth beare The bell for lore, and Actius doth sounde his thumpinge geare: To Menander the Commicke gowne of Afphranus was fit. Plautus the swifte delyuer stile of Epicarme did hit. Cecilius in grauitie, Terence in art doth passe. Those Rome doth cun, those mightie Rome doth crowde thicke in compasse Of Theatre, doth gaze on those to Poets those bee mounted. And all from Liuie to our tyme be perfect poets counted. The people sumtymes see a truthe, sumtymes are ouersene. If they so praise these Poets, which in alder time haue bene, If they make them Aperse Aes that none are like to them: The people then is misconceaude, such vmpers I condemne. If they do thincke that ould men write sum harde, sum out of vse, Sum slowthfully, and lowslie to, and do not them excuse, Wyse is that folke, and of my minde and iudgeth vprightly, I do not blame, nor haue not wishte that Liuies verse should dye, Which crewell, sharpe, Orbilius did teache to me a childe. How they I maruell seme to trim, such maiestie to beare, That they to principale good stuffe approchinge on so neare Mongste whiche if one well vttred worde haue glimpsed at a shyne: Or if there be a verse or twaine that semeth sumwhat fyne: Uniustlie they presume the hole to be summ preciouse thinge, And dare vnto the Stationer as sailable it bringe. I thincke not much that thinges are carpde comde from a blockyshe pate, But that those things are counted worse which were commencde of late. The lycence of the auncients I neuer mente to craue: There honors and their good rewardes I woulde be glad to haue. If Attaies interlude were good (in case if I shoulde doubt) For that it spoke of tryfling toyes, certes a shameles lowte Our seniors woulde blame me al, for that I would amende Those things, which Esopus the graue and learned Rossie pende. Or that they thincke nothinge is good that is not to their pay, Or that to their inferioures they thinke shame to obey. And that they thincke it now a shame to leaue their wilsom waies, Which these haue berdles learned once, and in theire youthfull dayes. He that can praise the Anthymmes of kinge Numa, though that he Be lyke my selfe, yet nedes must he of greater iudgement be. He cannot he delyte himselfe in those which dyed of late. Us eeke, and oures he pincheth at, both deadly he doth hate. If nouel woorkes had bene of greekes accompted of so could As now of vs, where now had bene these workes, which we call oulde? Or what thinge publique had there bene written, and extante then Which might be red, and flye abrode amongst the handes of men? As sone as Greece abandonde warre, and gan to fall to toyes, (As done those folke which gin to tast at ease of fortunes ioyes) Now to horses, now to wrasslings attentyue much it was, To viewe straunge workmanship in stone in Iuorye, and brasse. Hangde vp their lyuelie phisnomies in tables dighted gaie: Sumtimes did ioy in melodie, sumtimes in tragique playe: Lyke as the infant vnder nurse cryes still to haue the teate, And afterwarde at ryper age doth leaue her loued meate: So chaungde the grekes. For what O loue is so nouell, and straunge, But minde of man still discontent woulde see a further chaunge Things sweat or sower stil change by chaunce and varie frome their kyndes, So chaungeth goulden peace to warre so chaunge the luckie wyndes. Longe was it pleasaunte vnto Rome, a solempne vse to wake, And in thine open house earely great busie paines to take: To geue their Clientes solempne reede and firmelie to fore caste How that theire money well bestowde might multiple at last. To heare their betters teache the worse, by honest trade to gaine: And to extinguishe hurtful lust the parent of much paine. The fickle folke haue changde theire minde, eche man is burning hote To be a starte vp wryter straighte in that a lone, aflote. The younge, the ould of grauer wittes at supper haue with baye Their pendaunte lockes encompasde rounde and verses they outlay. Yea I my selfe that vse to saye I wryte no kinde of ryme: Am founde more lyinge then the Parthes: and do cal for betime Ere sonne be vp, my trinckets al, my paper, deske, and quill. He is a fraide to rule the ship that can rule her but ill: None dare make boulde to minister. vnto his patiente Woormewoode, except he know the thing, and know to what intente. Phisitions with their owne arte wil onlie haue to do: The blacksmith he with shop and styth doth mel, and looke vnto. Learnde, and vnlearnde we poemes pen on all handes in eche place. Our error tho, and small frensie what great vertues, and grace, It hath, consider this with me: the poets fixed minde Is commonly not couetouse, nor rauishd from his kynde. Uerses he loues, them only plyes his losses, (as the guyle Of seruantes vile his house is brent) at those he doth but smyle. No fraude he meaneth to his frende to Orphaines infants none. He can dyet with grudginge breade, and peasecoddes all alone. Good in cittye, though he be but a milksop in the warre: If you graunt this that great affayres by small thinges helped are: The tender stammering mouth of boyes the poet frames by pains: At the same times from language lewde their eares he doth restraine. Straight he instructs their brests with rules, as frindly as may be, Of dumpishnes, enuye, and ire a sharpe controwler he. He shewes to spende the time to cum by samples past before. He doth reiesture acts wel dun, comforts the sicke, and pore. How should yonge virginnes, &amp; smal boyes haue knowne how they might praye, Except the muse had poets rasde to teache them what to say. The queare thus taught craues helpe from heauen and feeles it cum with all. This fayre, speachde queare through learned prayer waters frome high doth call. Turnes backe diseases dryues away all daungers full of feare. Obteineth peace, of corne and graine a much abundaunte yeare. The goddes aboue are calmd with verse, with verse the hagges of hell. The fermers oulde, stronge with a small, that led their liues so well, Their haruist done refreshde their corpes. On hollie dayes with cheare, And minde with sporte, which such harde hap for better hope did beare. With wyfe, babes, seruaunts, to Tellus did sacryfice a swyne, And to Syluanus offred milke a sacryfice deuyne. To Genius that makes men mynde the shortnes of their dayes, They sacryficed flowers, and wine and lo by such like wayes, Came firste the fraunchyse Fessentine, the rude vnciuill sorte, Fessentine libertie, by the vvhich on cert? testinat dayes poets might talke their pleasure on any man. Did rayle at wil in rural ryme through fredom of the sporte. And this licence through many yeres in pleasaunt plight did stay, Whilst to a very open rage was turnde the hastie play. This rage right honest families assailde, and was not blamde, Whilst honest men toke it in snuffe to see them selues defamde. And those that were not blemishde yet in generall did feare To what ende might procede at length this sawcie tauntinge geare. A law was made, and penaltie annexed to the same: For very rygor of the lawe they tornde their former trade: Fayre woorded rymes to please the eare gan then for to be made. The conquerd Greece, her victor Rome with poemes did delyte, And brought artes into Italie, a realme vnciuil quyte. So vanished Saturnes piuishe rythmes which he before had taught, And better speach, the clottred clotte of duncerie brought to nowght. Yet manye a wynter after that, Did base speache with vs staye, And left mongst vs sum footesteppes yet remainyng to this day. For Rome to greakish writings laide her eare but now of late, And beinge after Punicke warres in calme, and quyet state, Began then first to make the searche, and partly for to smell What Eschill, Thespis, Sophocles, had put in writinge well If worthely they could translate then gaue they first assay, Hawtie, and sharpe by nature they and for their proper pay, They breathe thing tragicall enough and luckily are boulde: But they feare blemishe in their worke, and no such shame they woulde. A commodie is thought to be a thinge of lesser payne, Becawse out of our dayly deedes the most therof is tayne. A commodie is so much more of great, and weightie charge, Because her libertie is strayte, Commodie. at least not very large. Behold Plautus how he sets out, by what apparaunte arte The beardles louer, heedfull syer, and craftie Lenos part. Dorsen in paintinge parisits bestoweth all his vaine: Right dessolute in all the rest, as one that takes no paine, If he may cofer vp the coyne or hent it once in hande, Gramercye let his commoditie or settle downe, or stande. He that for brute, and wyndlik fame doth bringe to stage a playe, Him manie hearers wil make proude, small number will dismaye. So small it is, so light it is, that makes the gloriouse mynde, That huffes it vp, and puffes it downe most chaungeable by kinde. Both commodies, and Tragidies, Fayre well say I, if that The peoples euill voice make mee leane, or good voyce make me fatte. These two doth much exanimate, and strykes the hart full coulde, And makes those poets much ashamde, that ought most to be bolde, That oft the greater companye, in vertue few, and base, Untaught blockheads, braineles, ere while at buffits for their place, Though all our nobles like it well in midst of all the plaie, To beare baytinges, or pricke playings, our Rudesbies must awaye. Yea now our nobles do at length their eares from toyes restrayne: Yet flote their eyes, and hede of toyes which be but very vaine. They can sustayne fower howers to see our stagies brauelie dight, Of horsemen tropes, of footemen ranckes, how they are put to flight: Straight, captiue kinges are haild in sight with pinnyand armes behinde: The wagon, coche, horselitter, Barge, to follow are assinde: The captiue booties must be seene, all things to please the eye: To heare a learned commodie we wery by, and by. Democritus if he were here wher he was wunt to be, He would I warrante laugh a pace, and make a noble glee, If that the whyte straunge Elephante, or yet the Camell can Reteyne the people attentiue, and make so many scan, A gawishe sort gredie to gase not gredie to be tawght: At whom more then at any vyce a wiseman would haue lawght. What so is tould amongst thee flocke so as it cumes to passe, As fruitfullie a man mighte tell a tale vnto an asse. What noyse, or noyses to this noyse, comparable in sounde? So sterne it is, so shrill it is when th' eccho doth rebounde The rore of wooddes, the rore of seas thou wouldest thinke to heare: Such rule, and ruffle make the rowte that cum to see our geare. Deuyses, pagaunts, vestures straunge with which the players drest, The people hauinge harde no worde to clap their handes are prest. Masters why lawgh you so (sayth one) what did the players say? Nowght yet (sayth one) we lawgh to se the goodly garments gay, The coollor cleare, the noble dye vpon that purple gowne: Most like vnto the purple hue which cums fro Tarent towne. Lest thou should thinke that I disprayse the thing which I do make Because it is kynde of charge which other vndertake: That poet on a stretched rope may walke and neuer fall, That can stere vp my passions, or quicke my sprytes at all. Stere me, chere me, or with false feares of bugges fill vp my breast, At Athens now, and now at Thebes, by charminge make me rest. Concerning vs which studie not to serue the staringe stage, But wryte, which the posteritie may reede from age to age. If thou dost meane to haue vs pen sum clercklie worke in deede, Worthie Sir Phebe, and to put oute our bookes with better spede, Cutte of the carke that nippes our harte, (a woorke of passing meede) That poets with more feruent minde then commonly is seene May viset oft the musies nyne, and Helicon the greene. We poets do annoy our selues by many kynde of wayes: When I (as cutting downe, my vines) mine own woorkes do dispraise. Or when that thou art cloyde wyth booke, (Like noddies, as we be) We hurte our selues without respect, in geuinge bookes to the. Or if sum frende do reprehende but one word of our vearse, The hurt is ours that we becum so byting, and so fearse. When we do say, and oftens say our rymes which none would heare: When we take thoughte, becawse our toyle to no man doth appeare, Which we susteynde in making of our poems freshe and fyne, By drawinge them so featly forth, and with so cleane a twyne. Or when we thinke our matter needes to such an ende must grow: That, when, how we deuisers be, assone, as thou shalt know, On thine own swinge thou wilt vs call, and make on vs with speede, And cause vs write, and worke it so that we no more shal neede. It shal concerne your honor to to haue to write mens acts. Retayners to the musies house, and famouse for their facts. To make their deedes in peace, and warre in stately style to sette: Such dedes as to vnworthie Clarks we ought not to commit. To Alexander Cherilus was welcum at those tymes: Who gaue him crownes (a princelie gift) for raggie rugged rymes. But as blacke incke doth blur, and doth the paper fayre defyle: So good thinges handled of a foole do seme to be more vyle. The self same king so prodigall, that bowght his trashe so dere, Made proclamacion to be made that no man any where, Excepte Apelles should portraye, except Lysip in brasse, Should cast to counterfeyte his face, which of such corage was. One painter passinge all the rest his minde was to haue had: One poet to, that poet was Sir Cherilus the bad. Though he were king and Conquerer, he might be coumpted tho, A very gowse to leaue the good, and fee a lossell so. But thy iudgements which thou doste geue will neuer worke the shame, And gifts which they had with much praise of the whiche gaue the same. Virgill I meane, and Varius thine owne deare Darlings twayne. Thou hast deserued well of lore, in quitinge of their payne. Faces in brasse are not set forth so lyuely in their kindes, As by a poets workmanship mens manners, and their mindee Are well discribde, and painted out. Its twyse so leeue to me, To write a storye loftelie, and stowte worded to be. As low to creepe, and poorely peepe: fayne would I take in hand To speake of lands, of hawtie towers, which on the rockes did stande. Of saluage realmes, of fowghten fields throughout the world to wyde: And now reduce to peace agayne thee onelie being guyde: The turrets that in peace kepe close Ianus the townes watcheman: And Rome so fearefull to the Parthes thee being cheuetaine. This would I wryte, if that my power could satisfye my will. And true it is thy maiestie a righte great style would fill. Its standes not with my shamefastnes to vndertake the thinge, To beare that which my strengthe dothe shrinke, and shame vnto me bringe. To much a doe doth hurte him moste, that mels with it the most: Cheefelie if he in toungues, and arts be rashe to make his boste. A man may soner beare awaye and rather kepe in mynde The thinge deryded, then that is prayse worthie in his kynde. That commendation force I not which doth my merits passe: As eke I would not haue my face set out in wax or brasse. For euil inuented poecie I would not haue a name. Leste praysed so be yonte al home it chaunce me for to shame. And lest my wrytings which I thought eternal brute shal haue, Upon one beare, as sone as I be caryed to their graue. I meane vnto the mercers shoppes, wher francke incence is soulde, And what soeuer spycerie in waste paper is roulde. To Iulius Florus Florus, thou inteyre, faithful frinde to vertuouse Nero, If one sell the a straunger boy, and say vnto the, (lo) This fayre skinde boy, for such a Summe If thou wilte shalbe thyne, A seruaunte at his masters becke tydie, prompte, preste and fyne. Well trainde in greeke, fitte for all arts and one that will in space, Trim imitate, and counterfeyte ech countynuaunce with grace. He can singe, though not cunninglye Yet sweetlye at a table: Muche wordes, and cracks do make I know ones credit seeme lesse able. When one setts out his wares to muche as pretiouse stoofe alone, For that for redie downe toulde coyne he fayne woulde haue them gone, Though I be pore, yet nothinge shall compell me for to lye, Cowpes man not one in all this towne wil vse the thus as I. Thou arte not all, this will I say, (I speake it vnto the) This boy ran once for feare of whip, and na but once from me. Bye him, oneles thou doste mistruste that he should run away. A man his coyne in suche a case with small distruste mighte paye: Thou boughts me knowinge all my faultes, my nature toulde before, Yet wilte thou haue to do with me and troubleste me righte sore. At our laste partinge, what I was I toulde the plainelye than, For suche office moste impotente, a lame, vnable man. And that thou shouldste not take me vp with visage sad and glum, Although no lettter vnto the from me at all did cum: What vaylde it me? If thou wouldste looke vpon the lawes agayne, And see how they do make for me thou wouldst not thus complaine, Because I haue not writ to the, False of my word sayst thou: The law will waye with me in this I tould theeth is, or now. Iucullus had a souldior, who with warre much weryed than, His voyage wayges being payd all craftye, as he can Whilste snorting like a very hogge the foretoylede did groyne, A pridgeman from him pryuilie his money did purloyne. Then like a woolfe most vehemente agaynst him, and his foo Incensd, with fellon fasting face he flings, and fayreth so, The councter Captaines standerd straighte he swayed to the ground. Garded about with force of men, Enuyrounde thike and rounde. Renoumed for this valiaunce in ample recompence They gaue him twentie sextersies to kepe his port, and spence. The prætor then (I woote not why) began t'assayle a forte. And lookinge for much good at him spake to him in such soorte, As would haue moued a very sheepe: Goe lustye lad, (? he) Prease on with luckie foote to where thy pruice calleth the. Famouse shalbe thy ritche rewarde: march on why doste thou stay. To whome the souldier quiet now demuerlye did say. Drad Syr a verye daster lowte will suffer payne and pyne: But then when he is spoylde of all as I was erste of myne. Rome was my norse, and scholemaistres, and in her was I taughte What damagemente the Troiane rowte by dyre Achilles cawghte. Athens she me instructed so that sciences I knew, And that wysely I could decerne the false thinge from the true. In Platos schole the morall lore I gan to learne a pace Whylst troublouse tymes, and hasserds hard distrurbd me from that place. The ciuill heate then me vntraynde did animate to warre, Warres which to match, with our August vnable were by farre. Thence lighted I in Thessalie of fethers then deplumde, I browght full low my house, and landes, and all I had consumde. Bould pouertie made me sterte vp, to versefie, and ryme: My verses neede not to be fande, or scumd at anie tyme. Excepte I would dispyse the arte, and dissolutelye thinke, That it is worse to versefie then is to swill, or drincke. Howbeit my wyt, which I haue had beginnes for to decay, And ech yeare plucks away from me as it doth passe away. My games, my iestes, my lustes, my feastes, from me they made to go, And now would steale my poems to. what wouldste thou I should do? Concernynge kyndes of vearse, not all delyte in any one. Thou louiste the common verse, and he Iambique verse alone. Sum lykes Satyrs, and thwartinge speache: I haue thre at my borde, Not one of them bowte anye thinge with th' other will accorde. Eche one from other straunged so that diuerslye theye chuse. What should I writ? or what not wryte? He biddes, thou doste refuse. That which thou craues, and doste alwayes take in the better parte, That other do mislike, and thinke it, toto harshe, and tarte. Againe, thinckes thou that I at Rome my vearses can indyte Mongst so much toyle, and such a coyle, suche soking carke, and spyte. He calls me for a sewertye, an other for to heare, (All other busines set a part) his newe deuysed geare. Helyes on mounte Quirine, and he yont Auentine doth lye, A sunder farre, yet to them both to see them both must I. Thou seeste the gay commodities we sillie students get. No thinge dothe wante, nor streate, nor talke our studies for to let. The horse, the carts, the merchantes to?gues, a clattringe noyse of bells, Now crosbow shotte, or peale of gunnes our glasse wyndors downe fells. Skrykyng, howlyng at funeralls, the bawlinge masties crye: The hoggs yell out, heers noble stuffe, let him go nowe applye His shrill tunes, sonets, that dothe thincke this place to be so good. The bookish crew did euer yet delyte, to haunte the woodde, Righte Bacchus Clyents, lyke to him, they hayte to haunte the towne, And vnder solytarye shade to reste, and lye them downe. Mongste hurlie burlye, nighte, and day wouldste thou haue me to sing? To treade in Poets narrow trace? If Athens could not bringe To sum with seauen yeares harde studye greate plentie of hyr lore, Though theye waxte ould with booke, and care, Yet blocke heades, as before Departe they home with shame enough: I that am dwellynge here Midste wrastlinge waues, and routinge storme; of all this busie gere, Can I in case so cummerouse, in such turmoylinge tymes, Fynde in myne harte to tune with harps my iarringe Lyricke rymes. I knew too Orators at Rome th' one was to the other, In mutuall prayse for both their gaynes a faste ytrothed brother. These franticke knackes haue Poets to I wis I know it well: I wryte Lyricks, he Elegies both woorks say we excell: Both woorkes becum the musies nyne, behould with what a pride, And what a doe we Poets walke, and looke on euery syde. Dogge thou vs once, and listen well, and eftsones thou shalte heare What goodlye felowes be we twayne, why we the lawrell weare. He kills me with his bablarie, and I againe him quell. To Samnet souldiers feightinge ill. we are compared well. I am Alceus by his doome: and what is he by myne? What but Calimachus? if yet he woulde be more deuyne, I call him great Mimermnus streighte, thus by our wished name We grow vp both, (as I cast it) to be of flyinge fame. I heare, and see, and say the beste, and this law do I fynde Easeful for me, leaste I stirre vp the waspish Poets kynde. And when my doings cum abroade, for good will that theye beare me, Thaile praise it, be it good or bad, I neede not for to feare me. Euil versefyers mocked be, yet haue they to theire ioy, Whilste theye indite, and reade theire toyes, moste chearie, and moste coy. If thou sayste noughte, they prayse them selues lyke good ones as they be. But if thou wilt good poems wryte this will I say to the: As thou in lawfull scanned vearse canste well descryue a thinge: So muste thou to into thy mynde good law, and virtue bringe. Thou muste be bould to seuer oute words that be not of lighte, Wordes of no weighte, and such as be not prayse worthie in sighte. Though they do cleaue vnto thy ryme vnwilling to departe, If they be noughte, though theye be vsd of Poets in theire arte. Thou must abandon vnquoth words, and bringe eeke into vre Brighte, lightsum stuffe, sounding, and graue, not simple, and demure. Wordes vsed by the antique Dans, the fassions once did beare: But now caste of for verie elde, he muste bringe nouell geare, Whiche father vse hath bred, and taughte pythie, and playne wyth all. To ritch his cuntry let his words lyke flowing water fall. Cut of processe, and sleake, and fyle thou, that whiche runnes not rounde, Picke, and cull out with heedefull skill what s'euer is not sounde. Ech personage in his righte Quue take heede that thou dost frame, In diuerse parts the gestures, and th' effects, are not the same. Rather to me for to be thoughte a doulte, and dissard vyle, If that my follye might please me, or seeme good for a whyle: Then to be wyse, and vexed ay: (as wysemen be moste greued.) A man well knowne in Arge there was, who stedfastlye beleeued, That he did heare braue melodie, and see trim fellowes play. Thus fanseinge, on an emptie stage he would laugh all a day. In all points ells an honest man vnspotted in his lyfe: A good neyghbour, a good fellow peaceable with his wyfe. No brawler in his familye, nor angry for a crewse Breakinge, no crafte of man, or place could him in ought abuse. When he by welth, and frindly helpe recouered by, and by, Had chasde awaye with herbes, and drinks his ould melancolye, And cominge to him selfe againe, by God my frinds ? he) By this your doing you saue not but you haue killed me. From whom is gone, pleasure alone the lyke can no man fynde: So pleasante dotage cutte a waye by curing of my mynde. Certes its good for to be wise, and cast these toyes awaye, To leaue vnto the younger sorte this riminge kinde of playe. Not reulie to consume our dayes in musicke sleight, and cleane, But truly to direct our wayes in measure, and in meane. This thinge I oftens talke vpon, and oft I thinke of this. If that no lickoure coulde asswage thy greedie thrust (I wis) Thou wouldste tell the phisition: the more that thou hast got The more thou wants, confesse thy selfe of this so fowle a spote. If that with certayne rootes, and herbes thy woundes could wel bee drest, Wouldst thou therefore to heale thy selfe neglect to do the best? I sayde in deede that he was wyse that had the coyne in store. But since thou hast no more of witte thoughe thou of wealthe haue more, Why dost thou vse my counsaile still? If ritches make one wise, Lesse feareful, gredie, or (for fiew) better in any wise, This wote I wel, and dare speake it thou wouldst ashamed be, That any man which is alyue should leue them more then the. If that be thyne whych thou hast hyrde, or which thou hast of oulde, That is thyne owne which was to the but verie lately soulde. Thou bowghst the ground, and so it is that vse hath made it thine: Thou boughst it with thy propper goodes, what should I more defyne? What skils it whether thou dost liue by purse, or by thy field, If for thy fielde thoughe longe agoe thou moneie once did yeelde? He that doth thinke that goods, or landes can be his owne for longe, A foole is he, a fonded foole and doth himselfe but wronge. He cals it his, because without controulment, he dare take it, That thing which chaungeth in one hower no man can stable make it. That which doth run from man to man in flitting fickle guyse, By conquest, lot, by chop, or chaunge, by prayer, and by prise. No terme of state dothe dure for ay, heires cum on, one by one, As gliding waues in swiftye streames are quickly cumd, and gone. What proffits medowes, or els barnes, our pastures, and our parkes: What all, wherefore so gredelie the moneie mucker carkes? Pearles, stones, iewels, pictures with costelie kynde of tainte, Siluer or silks so liuely wroughte as hand of man can paynt? Since death at length thinges great, and lesse doth wipe awaye as cleane Successyuelie in such effect as they had neuer beene. Sum can not cum to haue this geare, and sum men do not craue it: And seinge what it is and workes, by all meanes shun to haue it. Why two brotherne, the one should set more by a quyet life, Then Heroldes palmes, and all his pompe preserued stil by stryfe. The other ritche doth neuer thincke that he can haue enoughe, And therefore delueth, hagthe, and heuthe, by mooneshyne goes to ploughe. God knowes, that God, whiche in the starres hath temperde eche mans fate, That nature God, which hathe so cleane estraunged eche mans state, That all men differ by their deedes: But he is very sad To see them euill, to see them good as merrie and as glad. I will take from my little heape, and sewer I wil not snudge, And as touching my successor, I feare not if hee grudge. Twixte prodigall and liberall, fayne would I know of the Twixt sparing, and the couetouse if difference none be. It differs much to spende alwayes, and spende at honest tyme: Differs from both, to catche, and snatche with couetyse, and cryme. Best is, as children vse, sumtymes to learne, sumtymes to playe: Sumtymes to get, of our gettinges sumtymes for to assaye. Neede, and an vncleane house fro me let these two ills be gone: Let whether hoyst, or sincke me down, the worlde shall fynde me one. I row not full saile, as I would euer with wished wynde, Yet doth the wether serue me so I cum not farre behynde. In credit, witte, in vertue, wealthe, in outward shape, and face Behinde the first, before the last, I kepe the middle place. Thou arte not couetouse thou sayst, Be gone I like the well. But didst thou with the couetyce all other crymes expell? Art thou without ambition deuoyde of vaine desier, Without all feare fantastical, and hastie, chafing ire? Dreames, charmes, iuglings witchcraftes, night booggs wunders of Thessallie, Canst thou contemne? the holly day with worship dost thou plye? Canst thou forgeue thy neighboures falt, art thou not more austere, And crabbe in conuersation as oulde age draweth nere? Of al these thornes that pricke m?nes mind, why pulles thou out but one? If thou canst not lyue as thou shouldste, from those that can, begone. Ye worldlings, you that haue enough, of meate, drincke, and of playe, Surrender now, full time it is for you to cum awaye. Leste euen younge folke seinge you drinke more then for you is meete Do make of you mere mockinge stockes, and campe you with theire feete. [The first book of Satires] Priscus Grammaticus de Satyra Satyra est carmen acerbum, instrumentum mordax. &amp;c. A Satyre is a tarte, and carping kinde of verse, An instrument to pynche the prankes of men, And for as much as pynching instrumentes do perce, Yclept it was full well a Satyre then. A name of Arabique to it they gaue: For Satyre there doth signifye a glaue, Or Satyra, of Satyrus, the mossye rude, Unciuile god: for those that will them write, With taunting gyrds, &amp; glikes, &amp; gibes must vexe the lewde, Strayne curtesy, ne recke of mortall spyte. Shrowded in mosse, not shrynkinge for a shower, Deming of mosse as of a regall bower. Satyre of writhled waspyshe Saturne may be namde, The Satyrist must be a waspe in moode, Testie, and wrothe with vice and hers, to see both blamde, But courteous and frendly to the good, As Saturne cuttes of tyme with equall sythe: So this man cuttes down synne to coy, and blythe. Or Satyra of Satur, th' authors must be ful Of frostred arte, infarst in balladse brest. To teach the wordlings wyt, whose witched braines are dul The worst wyll pardie hearken to the best. If that the Poet be not learnde in deede, Muche maye the chatte, but fewe wyll marke his reede. Lusill, (I wene) was parent of this nipping ryme: Next hudlinge Horace braue in Satyres grace. Thy praysed Pamphlet (Persie) well detected cryme, Syr Iuuenall deserues the latter place. The Satyrist loues Truthe, none more then he, An vtter foe to fraude in ech degree. The first Satire [of Horace] THE POET SPEAKETH Reuerently to his patron Mæcenas, bitterly controlleth the vnconstancy of men, and their chaungeable affections, that none of them will contente him vvith his share: and herupon taking occasion he doeth bende a great parte of his artillarye against the couetous: vvhose rauenous and vnsatiable doings, he doeth egerly deteste and abhorre. Right drad Mecenas, whats the cause that none contente abyde In trayned trade, that whylome choise or chaunce to them affyed? But loues, and lykes an others lote, and nouell lyfe pursues. Still flotes and flyts from former fate, Ne brookes the same to vse, Th' unwyldye warryer waste with toyle, wyth grouelyng elde for spente, O makelesse marchaunte mumbleth he, O state with blisse Yblent. The fearefull marchaunt he again, When waltring wyndes amayne With plunging puffes from Sothren coste, and hydiouse hissing rayne Torments the Sea, hoistes vp the waues, that doth surmounte the sayle, Saunce pere, doth deme the souldyers guyse, for why, they tugge, they hayle, They prease in plumpes on mortall yron, where eftesones eyther bayne Is prest: or gladsum trumpets clang dooth blase tryumphante gayne. The counsailer for Meede, or fee, that parles, and pledes the lawes, When at cockes crow, his gats are pushte with hastinge Clyentes pawes, Then happye farmer ofte, (sayth he, for thou in golden sleepe Arte soust: of mout or suite vndreamde, of barre thou beares no kepe. The chubbyshe gnof that toyles, and moyles, and delueth in the downe, If happlye he a suertie be, so sente for into towne: Who gapes, who gawes, who pores, who pries, who proggs his mate but he? Perfaye (saith he,) hers all things ryfe, these people blessed be. The resydue that rests vnroulde, the remnaunte that remayne Of this new fanglde fickle flocke, woulde pose and put to paines Fabie a common pratler.The fabling Fabies tatling toungue: to deskaunte and descriue The route, and rabble all a rowe A draughte to longe to dryue,) But that no tracte neede trouble thee, nor ambage breede delaye, Harke well how I will coutche this gere. put case som god woulde saye, Your lykings all allowde shalbe: and thou that erste in feilde The maces keene, the grounded sworde, the Tucke, the targe, the sheilde Was wunte to wilde, wyth passage moyst shall cutte the frothie playne, A merye marchaunte shalte thou row. and thou that didste disdayne To lyue and leade the Lawyers lyfe, shalt mucker in the grounde. Be trudgging hence, your trades are turnde, why stande you still in stounde? They will not tho, although they mighte accepte this blisfulle boune. Then whats the cause that Ioue thus mockd may not condinglye soone In irefull mode and dyre reuenge engourge his puffed cheekes Gaynste all this sorte? and spreed no eare to them that hensforth seekes And suies with pratlynge prayer to chop, and chaunge their former plighte. But lest som man should hould me in hands my tretys is to lyghte, To muche with laughter interlasde, (albeit the gest er may Harpe on a soothe, ells God for byd) and toyes may kepe and staye Sumtimes the reeder very well, as those that teache in schooles, With buttred bread, or featusse knacks will lewre the little fooles, To learne a pace theyr A. B. C,) I will be at a poynte Wyth nyfles now. Ile turne the leafe, and waightye thinges disiointe. The Churle that shreds y? earth with share, and wreakes the yeeldynge lees, The marryner that shaues the streame, and furrouse vncouthe seas: The Tauerner that falsethe othes, and litle reckes to lye, The souldyer that doth deale the battes, and makes his foes to flye, They say the cause they trauayle thus, that thus they care and carke, Is this: That when vnnimble age hath reste them of their warke, When fumbling foote denyes to meeue, when hande nil houlde, or hente, That then they might suffisaunce haue, leste easles neede them shente. Not muche vnlyke the lytle Ant, (a beaste of tydye toyle) Who drawes, and dragges her delycates orewharte the hillie soyle By mighte of mouth in al she may, and placed in her cell She stickleth, and bestirres her selfe, She huswyfes it right well. She carues it fyne, and mings it thicke and shroudes it vnder roofe. As one that of the wynters wrathe Were not to learne the proofe, Ne yet to care for after clappes. Whereby when Ianyuere That myrethe all the costs wyth slete and saddes the ginning yeare With aspere shours, dooth cause the cloudes and welken aye to wepe, Then Ladye Pismyer stirrs no where, shees claspde in closset deepe. Shee keepes her Chrystenmasse in caue and there they make bone cheare: They feede and feele the fruit of that, which once they gott yfeare. And wyselye to, but the (alas) no Phebus flaminge brande, Nor greuouse numming could that maks the chillyng sencelesse hande, Nor fearefull fyer, that flusheth vp and sumes to pitchye smoke Nor stormye seas, whose oppen iawes suppes vp wythout all choke The straglinge shippes: nor weapon whet, Nor oughte canne the deterre From huntynge after hurtfull horde: for whilste som such there are, That swimme in wealthe, and the surpasse in rytches or in robes, Thy glutton mynde will neuer staye, still, still thy stomake crobbs. What vayles it the so quakinglye to grubbe and grippe the moulde, And there in hucker mucker hyde thy Idolle God thy goulde? If that thou spende, and sparple it, no dodkin wyll abyde: The deuille may daunce in crosslesse purse, when coyne hathe tooke his tyde. And if thou snudge, and saue it sounde, and cofferte from the sonne, What shewe then hathe thy hidden hepe, what luste is therebye wonn? Admit on flore thou haste in store an hundreth thousande mets Of corne dehuskde: what cums thereby? thy belly houlds, nor getts No more then myne: as if in case to feelde thou shouldeste fayre With scrippe on backe, full fraight with foods. and straighte, as thou cums theire, The hungrye hunts muste haue it all: what makes thou by this matche? As much as he that carryeth noughte, (certes a woorthye catche.) Or els per frendshyp answer this: To him that doothe propounde Nature his guyde, and treads her steppes, what booteth him of grounde Whether, an hundreth acres he or els a thousande tills: Thou saiste, he fedes the eye the more. the from the huge hepe fills: Well syr no force, if that you will but condescende to this, That our repaste doth ryot shun, and reasonable is To kepe the soule and Carcas cheynd, to stynte the pyning styng Of hungers gnaw, and that we haue a meane of euery thyng: Why th?, what dost thou boste so much, thy plumes why dost thou spreade? What better is thy barnes, then our smale sackes that serue our neade? Muche lyke for southe, as if that thou a potte or pitcher muste With lyquor lode, and mights it fille at fountayne hereby iuste, And yet for fonde affection, thou, to please thy gredye eye. Shouldste wende vnto the flowing streame where greater gulfes do flye. At whiche whilste some haue reached farre and proferde ouer faste, The b?cke hath burst, that down they lusht, and so be drente at last. But he that leanes to temperaunce, and anchoures on her lore, And takes so muche as serues his turne, and gapes to grype no more Him needes not draw the drubbled dreggs of fowle by durtye poole, Nor yet for deuelishe thirste to haue (as one from vertues schoole Exempted quite) fetche from the brim and ouerwhelming waues, Where now and then (O iust rewarde) in raginge surge sum taues. The Christall springe shall woorke his will, and syluer channelde wells Shall yeelde ynoughe, where lurrks no dreade, where slyme ne slabber dwells But out (alas) the greater parte with sweete empoysned bate Of welthe bewitchde, do weene their wants aboundance in eache state. For monye maks, and mars (say they) and coyne it keepes the coyle, It byndes the beare, it rules the roste, it putts all things to foyle. A mann's his money, and no more, wherin confused is An heauen of happs, a worlde of weeles, an hunnye bath of blisse. O dottrells dome, and is it so? what guardon for these doultes Shall we deuyse? lets suffer still the foolishe frantycke foultes To wallowe in their wilfulnes, whose vnder eating myndes Is neuer cramde, but prooles for more and swarues not from their kyndes. Such one we reade of in olde tyme, that dwelte in Athins towne, A man in substance passinge rytche, nathlesse a niggerde cloune, At whose scarceheade, and couetyce the worlde did out as make, But all in vayne, he forste it not, he sought not howe to slake Blacke fame, that frisked euerye wheare, and bounsed at ytche eare, A figge for them (? brasen face) I force not howe I heare, They hauke, they hem, they hisse at me, I weygh it not an hawe, Whilste I may harbor in mine arke, and lodge wythin my lawe My darlynge goulde, my leaueste gueste, my solace and my glee, He is the bone companion, its he that cheares vp me. Tantalus.Ah simple cheare consideringe all, graue Tantale in thyn hearte, His fee dyd feede his fatale falle, his mucke procured his smarte. Whose lippes as drye, as any kykkes dothe ofte assay to taste The licker, to allay the droughte, that hathe nye all to waste His intralls, sterude for lacke of moyste, the fluds to eeke his paine They clim vnto his veray chinne, and then declyne againe. He catcheth, and he snatcheth aye, and stille he grates in teene, And stille shal do, for panges stille spring and freatinge sorowes grene. I pray the now, what cause haste thou to sporte and pleasaunce take? To faune vppon thy foolishe goulde whiche endlesse greefe doth make. For thou induriste Tantalls fate, and takynge but his name, This tale maye well be toulde of the, thou arte the veray same. Thy house, the hell, thy good, the flood, which, thoughe it doe not starte, Nor stirre from the, yet hath it so in houlde thy seruyle hearte, That though in foysonne full thou swimmes, and rattles in thy bagges, Yet tost thou arte with dreadefulle dreames, thy mynde it waues and wagges, And wisheth after greater things, and that, thats woorste of all. Thou sparst it as an hollye thynge, and doste thy selfe in thralle Unto thy lowte, and cockescome lyke thou doste but fille thine eye With that, which shoulde thy porte preserue, and hoyste thyne honor hye. Thou scannes it, and thou toots vpponte, as thoughe it were a warke By practysde painters hande portrayde with shaddowes suttle darke. Is this the perfytte ende of coyne? be these the veray vayles That money hath, to serue thy syghte? fye, fye thy wysedome fayles. Tharte misse insenste, thou canst not vse't, thou wotes not what to do Withall, by cates, bye breade, bye drincke, in fyne disburse it so, That nature neede not moue her selfe, nor with a betments scant Distrainte, and prickd passe forth her daye in pyne and pinchinge want. To wake all nyghte with shiueryng corpse, both nighte and day to quake, To sit in dreade, and stande in awe of theeues, leste they should breake Perforce thy dores, and robb thy chests, and carue thy weasaunte pype: Leste flickeryng fyer should stroye thy denne, and sease with wastefull grype Uppon thyne house, leste runagats should pilfer ought from thee, Be these thy gaines, by rytches repte? then this beheste to me O Ioue betake, that I may be deuoyde of all those gooddes That brews such baneful broyles, or brings of feare suche gastfull fluddes. But if so bene the pauling colde thy limmes dooth ouergo, Or els sum other worse disease hath daunte thy body so That downe thou must, and byde in bed, thy vauntage then is great, At elbowe preste thou hast thy frendes, who will prouide the meate, And tender the euen as them selues, confections sweete or tarte Theylle minge for the, suche as beste lykes thy quasye wamblynge hearte. Theyle treate the fyne physition with potions sounde and sure, By force and vertue of his skill thy corps for to recure, And to restore thee to thy sonnes and kyndely fryndes againe. Alas the whyle its no pointe so, thy wyfe she workes thy bayne, Thy sonne he inlye lothes thy lyfe, his regreate, and his plainte Is euer freshe, because that death doth linger to attaynte Thy hatefull heade, thy neyghbours, and thy cheefe acquaintaunce all Thy iacke, thy gille, thy kith, thy kinne doth prosecute thy fall. What maruayle ist, when thou haste loude thy siluer as thy lorde, If none loue the, whose loutishe lyfe deserude no louyng worde? But if thou thinckes th' alyes to lynke in frindshyppe and in faythe, And wenest thou maiste with smale a do from breache and foyshe wrathe Kepe tyde the knot, that nature knit: Ah sillye manne, in vayne Thou doste surmise this fruitlesse fetche, its farre beyonte thy brayne: Perseueraunce in amitie, and duraunce still in loue Discordeth muche from fickle man, thou maiste as well aboue The sluggishe asse a saddle couche, with golde and perle befret, And strayne his iawes, with brydle braue with goldsmithrye ybet, And so to make him praunce, and plunge, to friske, and gamballs fetche, To chewe vppon the spewinge bit, and at his foes to retche With harneste houfe: as thou canste learne the fraile retyryng man To treade in trace of trouthe outryghte in truth as he beganne. In fyne, suppresse thy lewde desyre: the more thou haste in store The lesse passe thou for pouertye, do trauaile for no more. Sence thou accomplishde haste thy wille, and purchesde wealthe at ease: O be not lyke Vmidius, whose rauenouse disease. It is not longe for to discourse. he, that he myght vpturne His coumed coyne, with shouiles wyde, him selfe durste not adorne With any weede that wealthe besettes, but lyke a miser ryghte, More ragged then a tatterde coulte did passe the poreste wyghte In peces and in tatter wagges: whylste that he had his wynde, And drewe his breathe, he spent no iote, a fraide that he shoulde fynde Neade in oulde age: but (loo) his wyfe of greakishe dames most stoute: With grounded axe cutte him in twaine, and rifted him throughoute. What? is it beste lyke Meuius Couetouse.the makeaway, to lyue? Or shalle I lyke Nementanus prodigall personnes. my gooddes to giglotts geue? Poet.A goodlye dishe, who taught e the this? why doste thou thus compare Extremyties? Is there no shifte, all spende, or els all spare? I would the not a nipfar thinge, nor yet a niggarde haue, Wilte thou therefore, a drunkard be, a dingthrifte, and a knaue? There is a difference betwixte the gelded Eunuke Tane: And Herniosus hote as coles, that rancke vnclenly swaine. A meane there is in matters all, and certaine bondes be pyghte, On this syde or beyonde the whiche nothyng thats good canne lyghte. But after longe vagaryes fetchde, to come to my requeste, How happeneth it, his owne estate that no man lyketh beste? But teenes, if that his neyghbours goate a bygger bagge doth beare Then his, or yeeldes her mylke sum deale more flowyng and more cleare: Nor euer will compare him selfe vnto the greater sorte, Whose state is base, and bad as his, who lyues in meane apporte: But roues, and shoots at further marks, now him he doth contende To passe in coyne: now him again, and so there is no ende. For he that thincks to coate all men and all to ouergoe, In runnyng shall sum ritcher fynde who still will bid him hoe. Suche posters may be likened well vnto the carters oulde Of forayne worlde, on mounte Olimpe whose carts when they were rould With gyrefull sway, by coursers swifte, to winne the glistring branche: They ierted vp their horse with whippes, that forth they made them launche With boysterouse noyse, lyke thunder clappes, they made the quaueryng soyle To dindle and to shake againe, in hope of lawrell spoyle. They neuer had respecte to those, that once were caste behynde, But scourde to geue the reste the slip, wyth course as wyghte as wynde. Ryght semblablye, this carkynge kynde of men doe neuer eye The route, that they haue ouerrun in goodes, but haste and hye To retche the resydue, and soe do ame aboue theyr strengthe, To pricke, and pearse those marks, &amp; whits, that lye withoute their lengthe. Loe this is euen the veray grounde, this is the perfytte cause, That most mislyke them selues so muche, and can no season pause In blesfulnes: and this is it why very selde we fynde A man so cloyed with the worlde as he that new hathe dynde Is with his meate and that thers none which in their extreame dayes Will parte from lyfe as full from feast to goe theyr homewarde wayes, To bannish all excesse of talke, let this suffyce as now, And leste thou shouldste suppose by space Crispine a vvriter aga?st couetouse to excessiue in talke.my talke myghte ouergrow In bulke the bleareeyde Crispins roole whose tounge on pattans free Did retchlesse run, euen here I cease not one worde more of me. The seconde Satire [of Horace]. The Poet still blameth, ficklenes and vnstedfastnes of those, vvhich laboringe to sayle fro the yrcksom poole of auarice, do willyngly contende to make shypwracke by the infortunate waues of prodigalitye: he speaketh agaynste fashions: they are thoughte to be noorses of pryde, and follye. The stewes, and stained house of drabbes, th' appotycaryes neate, The beggers, and the tumblynge trulles the horehunters, the greate And flockynge rakehell rabblement of ragges, and raskals al, Be pensife, and throughe plungde with panges to see the funeralle Of Tigelle, trustye frinde of theires, who whilste he lyued here, Dyd carolle shrille, and trimly tune his sonets sweete, and cleare. Their cause of greafe is sone expressde: he was both free and francke. They hanged on him, his purse kepte them so croustye, and so crancke. Couetous But this man, cleane contrarye wyse, t'eschue, and shun the name Of spendall, and of scatter good, and fearyng such lyke blame That doth ensue outragiouse spence, he will not geue nor lende One crosse of coyne, to clothe or feede his nedie naked frende. An other, if thou question him Prodigall why that he doth deuoure His syre, and his gransyres goodes, and turneth towne, and tower All into noughte, throughe greedynes and foule delyting throte: And why that he by gluttonye, and stomake raging hote Miscounsailed, doth make a sale of landes, and lordshippe wyde To bye such curiouse cates, as beste will downe his gullet glyde: His answer is not farre to fetch, posthaste he will the saye, That he doth thus set cocke on hoope and lauishly outlay This mucke, &amp; drosse the worlde hath sent, because he woulde not seeme Lyke one of carlish abiecte minde, so vyle a thing t'esteme That answer say the neuer thriftes, was geuen in the Cue, Well fare his hearte: the chuffes the same with deepe disprayse pursue. Fusidius, a landed man, a man whose fertyle feyldes, Whose medowes fayre, &amp; glebye groundes reuenues ample yeeldes: A man by art of vsarye, by guyle, and treachers trade, By fraude, and couin full of goods, is veray sore afrayd To spende amongste good companie, leaste on such prankes might springe A iauall, or a ruffins name, or sum such heynouse thynge. This Fusidie, to fille his purse, and to enritch his store, What soeuer cums by vsers skylle, to get, and gender more, He lays it to the captaine heape, whereof it rose, and grewe, He takes by yeare the fiftes of all, and so he bredeth newe. And if a man through negligence, perhapps be caste behynde, At parting he shall pay for that such fetches will he fynde. Heil go me lyke a craftye coulte, and listen euerye where, To vnderstande the names of those that late delyuered were From gouernment of masters sharpe, and ginnes to weare the weede, That onlye manhood doth beseme: there, there he sowes his seede. He mings deceite, he plyes the boxe, he strues me suche a trayne, That straighte he is with them to bringe, (God wotes) vnto their payne. Th' unbridled brutes, the younckers that are paste the cure, and charge Of Tutors graue, lyke lustye laddes, do loue, to roue at large, To roiste, and reuel wyth the beste, in suits of silkes to flante: Th' harde headed fathers they denye such spences vaine to graunte: Then cums this foxe, this Fusidie, wyth money preste in hande, He byes before their fathers death their lyueloode, and theyr lande, Who hearynge such malengin wroughte doth not abrade, and crye, Uppon the greateste God of all, that flings the fates from hye? But they, the sillye fonded fooles, (such be the youthfull braines) Do feaste him for his louesom loue, and highly prayse his paines. Certes, a man would scarse beleue, how muche this louely wighte, Whome others loue, doth loue him selfe, how he doth decke, and dighte His surly corps in ritche aray, what table he doth kepe, MenedemusAlmoste as greate as did the snudge, whome Terence toulde to stepe, And syncke in sorowes, and in sobbes, for that he chaste his sonne To Asie, there to pyke his crums, which deed vnkynde ons donne: He brake vp house, put myse to grasse, him selfe fed nothing fyne, With colewortes, and such carters cates, ofte woulde the caytife dyne. But here, if sum precysly aske, what doth this processe meane? It is to shew, that whilste sum men take care to kepe them cleane From blame, and blotte of one grosse sinne, incontinente they are caughte, Intangled with the contrary: lyke dullerdes neuer taughte. A nevv fangled minion of that age. Malchine, to make him singuler, a fashion freshe hath found, He swings and swoupes fr? streete, to streete, with gowne that sweepes the grounde, And thincke you Malchine wants his mates? no fye, that were amisse, An other pleasaunte headed chylde, in no sauce lyketh this. To proue himselfe a pretye man, and quaynte in his deuise, He maks his garment to be shapde, not of so large a syse: For wote you what? he coortalls it, it hardly hydes his rumpe, Rufillus, heis perfumde with muske Gorgoni, smelles oth pumpe. Meane hathe no mantion in the flocke. they kepe no steedy stay, In matter, and in nouell shape, they varie euery day, Sum one, or other lodes man stille, and what that he doth vse, The resydue may not ne, wil, for fashion sake refuse. Fashions in all our gesterings, fashions in our attyre, Which (as the wise haue thoughte) do cum, and goe in circled gyre. Fashions, in notting of the heare, in paringe of the nayles, In Otho, and mustacho beardes, thus fashions neuer fayles. In thother sexe, who would rehearse their fashion as they be, Might euen as well by augrisme tell, the grauell of the Sea. Those curiouse, crousting courtly dames, whose spangled vestures sheene With stones and pearles, of pride, and pryse, and Emrauds heeuenly grene, Doth geue the glimmering, gloriouse shewe, that feedes the gasers eyes, And dasles quite the simple lokes, with leames, that from them flyes: The world perchaunce doth thinke them gay, and in a chiefe degree: They be no better creatures, then other people be: Noe outwarde thinge doth better vs, no not our noble kinde: Not perles, or golde: but pearlesses gifts be praysd in Godly mynd. All els is toyes, and all is vaine, and all when they haue tryde, Will once confesse these things to be, but nutriments of pryde. The thirde satyre [of Horace] He Reprehendethe those, who be sharp accusers of others vyces, and can be contente, eyther not to see, or dissemble their ovvne. He dispraisethe the Stoicks discipline, who thought, al offences to be a like and equally to be punished: merylye after his maner, he beginneth with the minstrel Tygell, and disaloweth of his mutabilitie of life. It is a faulte, a common fault, that all our minstrels vse: The more you seme to craue a songe, the more they will refuse. Request them not, they neuer cease: right so would Tigell fayre, A singer of Sardinia thoughe Cesar should not spare, For his, and for his fathers sake sum musike to require. Yet woulde his humble suite ofte tymes cum shorte of his desyre. He myghte haue forsde him therunto: but Tigelle, if it had Cumde in his braine, woulde of him selfe, take on as he were mad, He, Bacchus ballets woulde recorde, sumtymes the trible parte, Sum tymes, the quauerynge deskantdure sumtimes, to vaunte his arte, A boysterouse basse he bounsed out, and iumbled on his stringes, No dram he had of constancy: so fickle in his thinges. Ofte tymes, he ran, as fled from foe, oftetymes in solemne pace He woulde proceade, as thoughe he were in seruynge Iunos grace. Sumtymes, an hundreth watyng men. sumtymes he kepte but ten: Sumtymes he spoke of potentats, and on his honour then Was all his talke: sumtymes, let me one dishe well dighted haue, (Thus would he say), and one course gowne my corps from coulde to saue. To this good husbande, that coulde be with pittance smale content, If sum good frendly man, of hope ten hundred crownes had lent: Within fyue days, no groate he had, in purse, ne yet in cheste: Al nighte he walkde, whilste morning came, all day he tooke his reste. Was neuer man so litle stayde. but sum, will say to me, And what are you? sum selye sainte? nay, halfe as ill as he: One Mauius, did frumpe, and floute at Neuie (then awaye:) A frende of his, a stander by, what serray, what I say? (Quod he): doste thou not know thy selfe, nor thincke that we the know? Meuius.My selfe, yes, I wincke at my selfe: therfore, a wincking dawe. Po.This is a wicked, witlesse loue, not to be wincked at: Synce thou doste know, and see thy sinne, and vse to wyncke at that: What meaneste thou, in others faults, so pearsantly to prye Epidaure taken for all kynde of serpents.With Egles syghte, or Epidaurs that sutle serpentes eye? But if in case, an other carpe sum cryme he sees in thee, He is too rashe, and vndiscreete, and no good fellowe he. A sheepe, a verey gestyng stocke, he treades his shoe awrye, His gowne sitts slacke, his heade vnkempte, vnciuyle, by and by. But he his good, and godly to, and one that wils the well, And thoughe his bodye be not braue, greate witte may in him dwell. Well, ryfle thow thy conscience, and looke thou be not led With any vyce, which nature hath, or custome in the bred. In feildes vnforowde frute is none, for brakes all ouer growes: To blow retreate, and to returne from whence my matter flowes: If we doe strongly loue a thinge, and lyke it very muche, Thoughe faultes in it be euident, yet we will see none suche, I would in race of amytie such dotage we might vse, And that vertue by honest name, such curtsye would excuse. For as the father for ill shape, his sonne doth not disdayne: So frends, at times must beare with frends, though faultes to them remayne. The sonne he squynts, the father sayth, he hath a pincking eye, His legges misshapde, the father sayth, his legge but standes a wrye. The parents pleasure much to prayse, and prattle to the ladde, Thy foote is very great (sayth he) thy foote is swelde to bad. Hast thou a frend that dyets hard? Well, cal him thrifty than: Hast thou a frende, a bragging lout? call him a iollye man, The kinge of fellowes amongst frends, for him no better name. Hast thou a frend with face of brasse, that bragges without all shame? Compt him of stearne, and haughtye hearte, that wel dare speake his minde, That wil not flatter, nor yet feare, how soeuer blowes the wynde. If he be suttle, cal him sage, if wylye, cal him wise: This, thisis it, that winnes thy frendes, and wun in frendship tyes. But wee, full ill construction, of vertue selfe do make, And eftsones do eclipps the prayse, thats due for vertues sake. For, if with vs be conuersaunte sum humble lowly soule, We call him goose, and disarde doult, and fowlye fatted nowle. Add if a man deale waryly, and beare him selfe vpryght Amongst such folke as foster fraude, and practise slylye sleighte, For name of skilful, wyttye man, and one that takes good heede. He is a deepe dissembling man, and crafty for his meede, If that a man can not conceale, but tell his verdicte free, (As I Mæcenas patrone myne, haue done full oft to the:) If that he speake to one thats whishte, or loketh on his booke, Or talke not all in printe, or tune, (say we) this coddes heade, (looke) This asse, doth want his common sence. woes me and out, (alas) How doe we aggrauate suche lawes, as gainst our selues doth pass? For faultles (doubtles) borne is none, and he is euen the beste, Whose lyfe syncere admitteth fiew, and with the least is preste. A frindely man, (as mete it is) the good with bad wil wey, If muche be bad, and more be good, let soulderde frendship stay. Let vs in equall ballance paise, and do as we would haue: Wouldst thou thine own offences cloke? in others faultes not raue. It is but right, that mum should mum. and perdon, perdon craue. For short, in that the vyce of wrathe will be our tenant still, And brutish part of modie minde, wil lodge affections ill: Why do we not by reasons rule, and by proportion iust, Deme of the cryme as it is done, and mulcte it as we must? If that the maister byd his man, from bord to take a dishe, The man dothe sipple vp the brothe, or feede on broken fishe: His maister hangs him straight vpponte: who wil not hould him mad Labio a lauishe toungued losell. vvho still vvas barking at August ther vpon compted madde. As Labeo? and why not thou as frantike, and as bad? Thy frende offendes, and graunts his guilt, thou wilt him not forgeue, What art thou then? a testye churle, great pittye thou shouldst lyue. If thou him hate and shun his syght, (as Drusos detters doe) Thou shalt be dreste, lyke Drusos selfe, he for to lende to moe, A creditous, Doth sheare, and shaue, and powle, and press, well, when his audit cums, When he most hopes of bestrecept, and to suruewe his sums, Then, gawlye wordes (for feare of strypes (when he his coumpts hath red) He doth put vp, with cap, and knee, A good felovvat those which from him fled. Euander cums vnto my house, perhappes, he drinks to much, Or breaks a iugge, or staines my gowne, or eats my dyat, such As was preparde, and plaste for me, is he the lesse for this, A merry grigge, a iocande frend, for euery sillye misse? Should I go baull a maine at him, as he had piekde my purse, Or me discryde, his pledge denyed or done sum thing, thats worse? Who almost hath at any time thought faltes of equall weight? Philosophers, (that bookish broode) maye teache the thinge by sleight But skille, and practyse counterplea, and profit it denyes, Profit, the nurse of iust, and right, Iustice rather by profit then nature,as tyme, and sequell tryes. When man abandond first the earth, and scraulde out of the moulde, (A dum vnwyldye creature) through hunger and through could, For foode, and harboure gan they fray: at firste, with toothe and nayle, And then, w? clubbes, and then with swords. which vse had taught t'assayle: Whilst wordes, ambasdors of the heart for to bewraye the minde Were putin vre: and names applyed, then to conserue their kinde, They ceaste from warres: made reare vp walles: and poundinge lawes did make, That none should filche, nor any robbe, that none shoulde wedlocke breake. For, or that cytyes had theyr walls, or Helen came to Troye, Haue women bathde the worlde in blood, (the cause of dyre annoye) But of the slayne was no recorde. they raunged, in eatche where, No spousailes knowne more, brute then beastes, the make knew not his feare. The mightieste man, like Bull in herde, did wreake the meaner sorte: Thus, graunte you must, that feare of wronge, set ladye lawe in forte. If thou wilte kalender in minde, the consequents of tydes, By noting longe dissente of tyme, in what effecte it glydes: Well maiste thou see, that nature telth, What lyke, what leaue we muste, Yet nature hath no pollycye, to seuer wronge from iust. But reason beareth stroke in that: and profit patrons ryghte, If reason reele, then profytte pants, reason saues both, by mighte, And as she doth, so will not shee vse argument, that he Which stealthe from hedge, and stealth from churche, in lyke offence should be. Let discipline alleyied be in measure to the vyce, When lyghte correction may take place, fare not in tyraunts wyse; Ne yet, when greate outrage is wroughte, with ferule doe not stryke. Where iustice slakes, there feare decayes, when thou makste all faults lyke, As purloyninge, with burglarye, or robbinge by the way, Trespasse wyth cryme, doth not thy doume foredome to vs, and say? That thou indede, in lyke effecte, wouldste execute the thinge, If choyse, by voyce, had hoste the vp, inuested once a Kynge: A kyng, eche stoicke is a kynge, for stoicks all be wyse: And, wysdome is it selfe a wealthe: Throughe wealthe do princes ryse: Wysedom is all: but thou arte wyse: then safelye, be of chere, Thou art fayre, stronge, and eke a kinge, a cobler though thou were. What wilte thou more? Sto: yes, Chrysip saies, the wyse man mends no moyle, Nor soles no shoes: Poe: lo, thus thou weanes to turne me to a toyle. The wyse man, thoughe he leaue the acte, reteynes the arte, as how? Hermogines sings not at al: Yet musyke he doth know. Alfenus made away his tooles, broke shop vp longe a goe, Is he not an artifycer, or not a crafte man, thoe? The wyse knowes moste, who knoweth moste muste beare awayethe name Of facultye: debarre him not, but let him haue the same: To rule a realme in facultie, which, none but wise can tel: If they can rule, though they rule not, Kynges are they by this spell. The stoicke wise: the wise can rule: to can, is full as muche As though he did: a Realme he can: then, let his name be suche. Can rule, is rule: none can but wise: the stoicke only wyse: The stoike therfore only kynge by this so strayte a sise. Yea stoike, art thou creat kynge, then must thou mainteyne port: VVitte alone insufficiente in regalitie, if it be bereft of other solemne and laudable appertinents. Els, wagges in stretes wil twitch thy beard and make at the a sport. Except thou take the to thy handes, and fence the with a sticke: Theile make the braste for agonye, in crowding the so thicke. And thou a wise, witpuisaunt kinge. that houlds thy crown by witte: Shalt be enforst, to howle and crye, (for suche a state vnfitte.) In breife, when thou a kinge at meales, dost ryse, or syt the downe, So sore precyse thou art that none will byde the, but sum clowne. But if that I miscarye ought, Cryspine. my frends will make the best, So I to them, so they to me, and this ingendreth rest. Thus, doe I passe my pleasaunte dayes and feare no stormye thinge, This priuate life I would not chaunge with thee, pretensed kyng. The fourth satyre [of Horace]. Hee Defendeth Himselfe, againste those vvho had reported him to haue bene slaunderouse, sharpe and corrosiue: He toucheth Lusilius Not to condemne his doings, but to haue them amended Heprofesseth to speake against no man, vpon superfluitie or disease of the braine, but vppon a mere francknesse, and liberty of the minde: specially, he rebuketh them, whiche will kycke and resiste when they should be cured. The Poet Aristophanes Eupolis, and Cratine, And auncients moe, whose interludes are saust with sayings fine, If any person were mislyude in theft, or leachers lore, Or wher a roisting quareller, they woulde display him sore, Hence, Lusill boroud al his vaine, those presidents he tooke, The matter sharpe, the feete but chaungde, the forme ful sleke did looke. In deede, the sence was too to tarte, within an howers space, Two hundreth verses he would make, thought he, a gift of grace. And would not moue his foote with al. But huddle he would roule, To halfe might wel bene scummed of, an ydle chatting soule. A milke sop long to pen a woorke, much more to pen it wel, The length is not material, the scapes he must expell. Crispinus, that greate length louer with finger doth me call, And darreins combats, if I dare: should Crispine me appall? Nay, thers my gloue geue velom here, geue iudges, tyme, and place, Lets see which one can more indite, and wyth a better grace. Well haue the godds appointed me, of no corragious witte, And speakinge seelde that I ne shoulde, confounde the foole with it. But thou (syr Crispine) in thy mynde, assembles fansies ofte, As bellowes sup and beltch out wyndes, to make the yron softe. O lerne not so to puffe and blowe, saincte Fannie followe well, That thou bestowde in surlye tombe Fannie an arche Asse or blockheade in vvhose memoriall vvas erected a block. thy statues here may dwell. As for my woorkes obliuion will raze them out of minde: A fewe or none that will, or dare behoulde them can I fynde. Wote you not why? corrosyue style, is corsey to the eye. They dreame a thing that blamed here, their counterfette should lye. They dreame a truth for fynde me one, amongste the sonnes of men: But loue of goods, or loue of rule, doth fonde him now and then. Sum lyue catesnd in Cupids chaines, and sum loue blasinge golde, And sum a sum of syluer whyte, or curraunte mettall wolde. Sume kepe exchaunge from Easte, to Weste, and sore vpon the Seas: Toste and retoste, (lyke wherlwynd duste ekynge the yr owne disease For mainteyn a unce of gotten stocke, or els to make it more. All these do stande in awe of rymes, and hate the Poets sore. The Poets proyne, beware (say they) that they may ieste their fill, They spare no speache, they spare no frende, fooles lauishe, and to ill. And if their toyes in letters lymde be printed once in booke: Then all the worlde muste take the vewe, and all sortes on them looke. If this be true: then harke agayne, I am no Poet, I. No Poet such as is discryude, am not I so? and why? Not hea Poet, that can make an haltinge hudlynge verse: Nor he in paltrye daylie talke that can his tale reherse. Him Poet dub, whose wit is sharpe, whose mynde doth mounte on hye, Whose throat is shyrle in trumpet wyse, to coutche mennes acts in skye. Therfore demaunde hath once bene made, if comedies myghte be A poecye, sythence in them the spirit puffes not free. No gourgiouse sounde in worde or sence, saue that in verse it runs: From prose yt differs but by foote, but (lo) the father burns In peltinge chafe, for that his sonne on wantons madded is, And leaues a spouse of noble dowre, this breedes a tempest, this. And that with torch n twylightinge he treades the romye stretes, How say you haue not commodies theyr vigors, and their spreetes. Old Pomponie, if he had lyude, what stirre now would he kepe, Pomponius an impacient nygarde. (thinge comicall) because his sonne, is drent in debt so depe? And what thoughe father Pomponie should grate his gaule in twaine, Affection makes no poecie, but lustie, loftye vayne. Its not inough to pen a verse, in vernishde wordes and pure, Eche worde alone must haue his sounde, and seme not to demure. Those simple wordes playmakers vse, those vse Lusill and I. So nyse, so neate, so numberouse. that alls not worth a flye. Disorder but the glydinge gate, the wordes appeareth tame, No glose there is of maiestie, not such as in this same. Foule moodi Mars broke brasen bars bare boulstred boulwarkes back. These wordes transposde, yet eche one hath of Poesye a smacke: And thus much now, an other tyme if rymes allowde may be. But now, why should this kynde of style, be so suspect in me. Promoters seeke, and pere eche wher, and vse to woorke much woe, Accusing and molesting men, whersoeuer they do goe, Feared, and much adrad of theues and losels loose of life, Not fearde of those that pilfer not, nor broch no brabling strife. Admit thou wart a naughtie packe, Birrus and Cestas, for al naughtie packes.as diuers other be, I am not one that doth promote, why art thou fraide of me? My verses geue no gase from walls, ne yet in tauernes fly, Not Tigell nor such alegunners my workes do ouerprye. I shew them but to very frendes, and at their great request: Not to eche hobb, nor euery wher. sum be that thincke it best, Their quaynt deuises to proclame, in market, fayre, and marte: To reade them graue, &amp; sounde them braue, and to vnfoulde their arte. Such pleasure haue pride practisers, who do it not to mende, Nor learne a decencie in thinges, for no such honest ende. A mallipert a merchaunte I of malice (thou wilt say) I vse this talke: whence issude this, gainst me that thou dost lay? Or which of my companions hath this instilde to the? Who pincheth at his frend, not prest, or if he burned be, Doth not alleuyate his blame, who scoffes to make men smyle, Who plyes for to be plausible, and doth his flowtinge file, Who can inuente things neuer mente, who nothinge can conceale: Such one is naughtes, beware of him, and naughte to him reueale. Sumtymes, at table thou shalte see a dosen more or lesse, Eche seekynge eche ortwharte the thums with tauntes, and tearmes to dresse. Their hoste they spare, for manner sake, till Bacchus tyde be vp: Then out muste al, mine hoste, myne hoste is scande at euery cup. Rayling thou hates, yet doste thou coumpte raylers but mery men, Good felows, francke, and free of speache: If I haue iested then, At Rufills tast Gorgonies smel, (two paragons of pryde) I am no freatinge ghoste therefore, nor slaundrouse, all things tryde. If chaunce we talke of Petills pranckes how he from tower stole, A massye peece of bullion golde, (to twyne thy tale in hole) Thou shaps it thus: (as is thy trade) Petille, I know him well, I haue sum cause to speake for him, for he and I did dwell Of childerne little in one house, my fellow, and my frende, Much hath he done for me at times, I founde him euer kynde. And yet I maruayle how he coulde rub out this trespasse so. Logille a fish vvhyt vvithout and black vvithin.(Lo) here a craftye postles parte, loe here a Logille lo Ha, false malignaunte wreaking minde, this vyce I do expell. As cancre freate, from hearte and booke, moste true it is I tell, For certaintie I lyke it not, then licence me the more, To gesse aloufe, not hard to scratche but clawe about the sore. My father, he did vsuallie, dehorte me from this sin, By manifolde examples, which, through talke he woulde bringe in. Still warning me not to ingrate, nor speke not much to lyue, Olde Horace his talke.But thryftylye, contentedly enioye that he would geue. Albie and Barns Scatter gooddes.Maiste thou not see younge Albie now how he is cumde to naughte, Backbyting Bar most beggerlike? Ingrayle them in thy thoughte. Two presidents, that thou ne shouldste thy fathers good mispende. But when he woulde dehorte from loue, his talke was to this ende. Sectan wanton and amourouse.Dissemblable to Sectans sorte, no brothelmonger be, So Trebon.Kepe wedlocke chaste, let Trebons name be warninge vnto thee. The wyse men with their moralls sage, by reason coulde the guide, Suffyseth me that I can geue, such counsayle as I tryde. And if my sawes in time take place, for teacher haste thou none, When groweth, and yeres shal make the man, youthes shipwracke will be gone. Thus woulde he turne my plyant youth, and what he wild in worde, For patterne he woulde bid me marke, The lyfe of sum good Lorde. So, if he would inhibite me, that is no godly deede My sonne (sayth he): and here vpon, sum foule reporte will breede. For euen like as when neigbours dye, the sickmans chaunging luste, For feare doth stay, and is contente, to cum to dyet iuste: So skillesse youth to see defame of others, may take heede, And slip not into vyces snare, nor listen to her reede. Hereby I stayed my tempting age, and did no haynouse sin In easye crymes, and veniall I haue bene trapped in. And these, (no doubte) wil wayne a waye and ebb, as they did ryse, By helpe of yeares, by frendes reproofe and by myne owne aduyce. As I lye in my bed sumtymes, on matters thus I muse, Thrifte would do thus, righte dothe diswade that I shoulde thus me vse. Thus coulde I make my chearfull frendes: this was a foolishe parte: Was I so fondlye ouerseene? a foole sone flings his carte, Thus do I mutter in my mynde, Ere whyle at cardes I play, (A faulte, amongste the meaner faultes) forgeue me, Thou saieste nay. Then Poets all preaz on preas on helpe at a pinche: no dreede, We be so ryotouse a route; The multitude cannot be led from their fancies, no not for truthes sake,who sayes but we shall speede? As Iewes do measure all by nyghte that none dare them forsake: So we by number will men force, in league with vs to take. The fifthe Satyre [of Horace] The fifte Satire, whiche the Poet had vvritten of his iorneying to and fro, wholye altered by the translator. Frende Horace thoughe you maye me vse as to translate your verse, Yet your exployte I do refuse, at this tyme to reherse. Not euery tricke nor euery toye, that floeth from your braine Are incident into my pen, nor worthie of my payne If all be true, that sum surmise, for diuers thincke it good, To haue discriude the clatteringe broyles, of Mauors raging wood: Or for to know the climats hye, to clym vnto the skyes To view the starres their placing eeke and how they set and ryse. Or for to reade the quiddityes and queerks of logique darke, To heare the babbling sophisters, how they for naught can harke, Or for to write thinges naturall, things mistical and geason: The harmonie of elements how they accorde by reason. To stert vp in astrologie, the casuals of men To limit, and forlote by arte, to shew by whom and when, Things were conueyde: and to erect through what aspect, and why Pompey abrode, Cesar at home, were fortuned to dye. To tel how man a creature, of reasonable minde Is sociable, apt, and fit to companie by kinde. To reade the sacred histories of man how he began: How first he fel, through whom he fel, what of himselfe he can. To learne the helpes of holy tongue, the doctors to peruse: To course the scholemen, as they lye, and Horace to refuse. Those cackling pyes, that vse to prate so much against humanytie. Are commonly the lewdest dawes, and skillesse in diuinitie. The antique fathers vsde it much th' apostle doth the same: Now al must downe in pulling downe that fooles may get a name. Som innouation must be made, or chaunge of vsed things Needes must there be: when al would passe, and all woulde needes be kynges. Moyses in writing his fyue bookes confearde with prophane tyme, Yet fewe or none, that I haue harde, appeached him of cryme. From Egipt we may borow stil, it neuer was forbod, So it be for the weale of man, and glory of our God. To reade sole scriptures is, I graunt, a thing of lesser paynes, And those that fayne would haue it so, would haue it so for gaines: Unable for to get of toungues, or scyences a skyll, Then crye they sole diuinity, as though the rest were ill. Diuinitye is gloriouse, and they but idle praters, Gainste whose outrage a man mighte well wryte forty godlye Satyres. The wise can reade humanitye, and beautifye their witt, Whilste fooles syt tatlyng to and fro in talking against it. A good diuyne might the translate (Horace) I can it proue: Who so denyes, I do not doubte to caste him downe my gloue. And yet such is the matter now wheron thou dost indyte, That I must play the poet needes, and wots not what to write. Thy lawrell greene betake to me, thy gowne of scarlet reade, And proue a nouice howe I can in after steppes I treade. Feigne me to haue a Poets arte, a natyue Poets brayne: A veray Poete, sauyng that I vse not for to fayne. Dames of Pernas of Helicon, whence Pægas horse dyd flye: (If yours it be) graunt this to me, in processe not to lye. Nay, thou O truth, both God and man of whom I stand in awe: Rule ore my wordes, that I ne passe the compasse of thy lawe. What should I wryte gaynste wickednes how synne hath all the hyre: How wyghtes are wed to wretchednes, captiues to their desyre? The Prophets haue bewayled that, Ieremye. and he whose voyce so shryll: Bothe heauen and earthe with plaintife tune, and dolours deepe dyd fil. The truthe himselfe when he was here Christe. did truly thinges foretel: And wept to see the sorye plagues, that afterward befell. If they moude few, if fewe would marke the wordes of such like men: How may the silly Satyrists hope for amendment then? In vaine for me to styrre or kepe a racket with my rymes: The sonnes of men, will styl be men and plyaunt to the times. What should I wryte, against wickednesse? the worlde by her aduyce Hath brought to passe, that most beleue, there is no kind of vice. For couetyse is coloured, and though the Prophet king Damne vsurers, yet stil we see more practise of the thing. Dame Gluttony is to to hye: she kepes in stately halls, And gurmundise is fellowship, for so the world it calls. So lust is now a lordly thing, and swearing hath a grace, Forswearinge couerde vnder zeale, (alas) the cursed case. What should one write, dissembling dawes (a wondrous tale to tell) The better birdes of noble price by creaking would expell. The popish dawes, whom all men knowes, To be still blacke of hue, Doo sweare themselues best protestants, and birdes thats only true. What should I write? by colour all true tytles they do steale, And couer thousande trecheries, vnder pretensed zeale. To know the matter perfectly, to vnderstand it well: Marke here what precise Commodus to Pertinax doth tell. Thinke Commodus to be such one, as couertly in hert Doth worship all Idolatrie, and mindes not to conuert. And yet through shewe of godly zeale, our church would quite deface. To helpe the popishe kyngdome vp, and to reteyne his place. Thynke Pertinax a peuishe impe, an impe of popyshe lyne, Who styll will be a Catholike, though all the bookes diuine, Doo proue his churche an heretike. Sir Commodus kepes styll In Englande for commoditie: Syr Pertinax he wyl To Louayne, to the mother churche, but howe they bothe haue sped, Perceaue that by theyr proper talkes, and what lyues they haue led. The hunger waxeth sharpe and keene, in Flemmishe bareyn lande, And Pertinax bet home with pyne, takes Commodus by the hande. Pertinax. God saue you gentyll Commodus, howe haue you fared longe Commodus. Nay veryly euen as you see. well lykyng fatte, and strong, Of credite neuer better I: what vrgent cause doothe make You at this tyme from sacred soyle, your iourney for to take? Pertinax. When we went to the holy towne, from Englishe flocke infecte, Our want was wealth, and coyne at wyll, we were an happye secte. But our long staye was oure decaye, men grudgd to geue vs more: And Sarum with hys subtile booke B. Salis. hath cropte our credite sore. Before, we gaue a countenaunce, to all the worlde so wyde: That our intent was wholly bent, to haue our quarell tryde. Suche cautels had we to beare of, that who gainst vs did wryte, We swore he was falne from the Churche, of gyddynesse or spyte. We bare them down that they were nought rashe, raylyng, and yll spoken, Lewde, and vnlearnde: but nowe our stythe of forgery is broken. Sarum hath walkde so waryly, (it greuethe me to name hym) That moste of men doo see his truthe, we wote not why to blame hym. Nowe they dispaire oure prostrate cause, and of our safe retourne: And suffer vs in beggery, (Ah silly case) to mourne. Commodus. Ah silly case, nay silly fooles, you myght haue lyued here, In wealth and blisse, and euen as there, haue kepte your conscience clere. Pertinax. In deede your letter writ to me, dyd signifye no lesse: But howe that you can vse it so, I woulde you should expresse. Synce I came laste into the realme, it was toulde me of trouthe, That you aboue the rest of men, vse to be freattynge wrothe With ceremonies, is it so? Iesu, what shoulde one hope, They say that you doo caste them of, as brought in by the Pope. Can you speake so precisely here: and beare vs so in hande? You are no doubte no Catholike as now the case doth stande. No Catholyke: Ah Pertinax thou arte a mery man. Commodus I speake, I graunte against the pope, and speake the worste I can, And profitte him, yet more then you, (perhappes ye gin to muse) But harke to me, and listen well what practise I doe vse. When you did cut the salt sea fome, with framed timbre borde, And yeade to Louaine there to heare, the Latine Romishe worde, Then storminge in my thoughtfull breste, and sharpe beset with cares, In mortall waues I wandred still, in maze of my affayres. Feare caste in all extremities. what shoulde I do, thoughte I? To sanctuarie of papistes to Louaine shoulde I flye? That were away to begger me to bringe me vnto neede: And in so doinge, I shoulde woorke, the mother churche smalle meede. Æneas came into my mynde, that feynde him selfe a greeke, And by that meanes made manye soules, Lord Dytis hall to seeke. He can not hurte his foe the moste that kepes the furst away: I was resolude to kepe me close, and see a furder stay, I sayde my wounded conscience did prickle more and more, And wyshed after some of skyll to remedye my sore. I sayde my doubte was dangerous, and therfore fayne woulde haue Some clarkly man, of insight deepe, within the same to raue. Thys was the tenour of my tale, that I woulde common fayne, If some learnde man on thother syde, woulde take on hym the payne. The Protestants be mercyfull, and glad to wyn vs all: In brefe the chiefe woulde me at length to common with them call. Theyr reasonyng was to and fro, to wyn me yf they coulde: And I began as debonayre, to render vp the houlde. Now hearken (oulde frende Pertinax) what was the spedy key: To ope the locke of credits forte, for me to beare a swey. He that was counted too to fearse and angry wyth the Pope, I went to him, and prayde him ofte my conscience for to grope. Parted from hym, I woulde proteste, and openly woulde say: That suche one was the greatest clarke that was on lyue thys daye. He that was holden moste of zeale, and to the worlde the best: Hym woulde I prayse aboue the sonne, and so I purchast reste. No more demaunde made of my faythe. I faynde me very ielous Of other men, and sayde they were drawebackes, and nothing zealous. And still I praysde my confessours, and made them so to swell, Such pulpit hornetts by my meanes, That none durst with them mel. And what that they to feede theyr minde, Or cholor ells would speake: I maintaynde it with toothe and nayle, in all that I coulde creake. Then was I dubde as true precise, and faythfull by and by, And none was compted hoate enough, saue he, and he, and I. I whysperde to and fro a pace, and playde my parte so free: That quarells stept vp fast and fast, A noble game to see. And that the rest might learne to stoupe, and I might grow vp still: An other fetche by peecemeale, I into them dyd instil. My mayster lysten well (quod I) take kepe, what I shal say. Me thinks this church, this englishe churche is clogged at this daye With ceremonies, more then needes, to tell you at a word, I would haue all things iust, as they were left vs by the Lord This knew I was the deyntye dishe, that so their passions fed: I am not now to learne I trow, to bring a babe to bed. Now whether for true conscience, or els that they might seeme Sole gospellers, and that the worlde, might so of them esteme: Or els through our suggestions, they gnawed so this bone, That O good God, I would to God they had bene let alone. Nay trust me truly Pertinax men would haue bene ful fayne, To thrust out all those gospellers, and sende for you agayne. How say you, was not this a drift. and that a drift of hope? Am I not now, as lege as you, to our good Lord the pope? If there were talke of gospels grace, of francknesse of our lybertie, Then would I whet my tongue to speake, agaynst the gift of pollicye. And that our seruice was consumde onlye in adoracion: Wheras the pryme church vsde one prayer, the rest in exhortacion. That ministers, (why should they not?) might goe euen like the rest. In suits of silke, in theynes of goldd, apparelde with the best. That ministers might take and leaue their orders when they would: I went aboute to make al naught by al the meanes I coulde. This was my greatest anchoure hold, I euer caste it thus: The worse it fared with their churche, the better much for vs. Untoward case vnluckye case, Ah Pertinax I say (As erst I sayde) a trumpe a trumpe was caste downe in our waye. And he that caste it, hath surueyde. and markde our cardes so well, That al oure driftes is nowe fordone, and you abrode must dwel. As for my selfe, who but my selfe I neuer felte lyke ease: Not stoutest of the protestants dare me in ought displease. I made my matche I trowe with suche, as dare not but vpbeare me: What if I knowe their giltie prankes, and therevppon they feare me? Those wryng, and wrest the meaner sorte, whose myndes and tongues are free, And so imbecill all theyr strengthe, that they are naught to me. I nowe can dubbe a protestant, and eke disdubbe agayne: And make a Papiste graduate, if he wyll quite my payne. Liuings are myne, geuynges are myne, the countenance is myne: Promotions come to me alone, or where I will assygne. Yea Pertinax if thou wilte come, of Laberinth ne drede, I can conducte thee safe and sounde, by vertue of a threde I knowe who plaies the catte, and howe her ioly kittles mouses, I and my patrons leaue small lore, in some right famous houses. And if there be not speedie healpe. against me and my fooles. Ile driue their Gospell from the churche, and learnyng from the Schooles. In deede I studye harde my selfe, but to what ende or why? That I myght gette the greatest fee, and put all others by. As nowe I am, I coulde not wyshe almoste a better staye: If the precyse crepe vp agayns, I knowe my wonted playe In the meane tyme I tell them playne they are the greatest clarkes, And that for theyr greate constancie, the totall worlde them markes. Yea, I can tell them clawyngly (but that is in their eare.) That those whyche haue deposde them thus, are persecuters cleare. And if that some by pollicie, in time doo not preuent them, Ile egge them on to speake some thyng. whiche spoken may repent them. Well yf that those get vp agayne, I kepe my iolly stay: And if sir Pertinax you come, I wyll not go away. So that come papist, or precyse, or formall conformable, The precisde Papist kepe his roume, lyke promontorie stable. And yet, yf thou as palpable, my conscience couldst grope, Of honestie, I am full true, vnto my lorde the Pope. Shaklockes profession.May happs when I haue filde my purse, with takyng all this payne. I will go turne from Commodus to Pertinax agayne. Pertinax What Commodus, thou turnes thy selfe as one shoulde turne the groate, Turne rounde, or else thou will be spyde in turninge ofte thy coate. Becawse you talked of gropinge erste, howe chauncde it heretofore, That you agaynst the blessed Pope, so solemnlye haue swore. Speake oute man, are you in a dumpe? howe durste you so farre go? Iuraui lingua, sed mentem non iuratam gero. Commodus I tould them then, I spoke with tongue. but neuer mente it so. Pertinax Why do you heare their seruice still, a thing of such abusion? Commodus, I could not els abyde with them, to helpe them to confusion. Pertinax. What say you to the precyse flocke, are they resolude that waye? Commodus Sum parte of them is like my selfe, the conformable say That halfe of those whiche busylye against those orders clatter, Are Papistes ranke: as those may see whiche will suruey the matter. Pertinax Why doo they make so straite accompt of thynges that bee but meane? Commodus Pythagoras, why dyd he put mans soule within a beane? Pertinax What if your selfe for not wearyng hereafter may be wrounge? Commodus Tushe man I made them longe ago, a verey Aesops tongue Pertinax. Synce you against these churchly rites so longe and sore dyd wynche, Howe coulde you nowe resume agayne so bucksome at a pynche? Commodus I sayde (as ofte I vse to say) that I was very poore, Nathlesse woulde geue tone halfe I had that I myght weare no more. Pertinax. I go to healpe a papist nowe, that ginnes for to recant, And I go nowe, for to moleste a silly protestant. Commodus O noble force of flattery, Farewell olde fellowe myne, But so farewell that you kepe close and come to me do dyne. Translatour. Farewell a payre of hellyshe impes of cankred Sathans race: For you are enmies vnto God, And his in euery place. The true precise, none doo despise, but all men knowe it well, That they in learnynge and good lyfe, moste commonly excell. Not one of vs, but wylls them well to keepe their godly name. Nor euer thought to preiudice, or to eclips the same. Some be so wyse by Papistes guile, they can not be abusde: Yet Commodus hath fonded some, it can not be excusde. If I shoulde wryte of Commodus, the craftes of suche lyke men, The tricklynge teares for hearty griefe woulde ouerlode my pen. But none wyll looke to Commodus, he beares the bell awaye, Some guerdon due for his deserte, The Lorde wyl sende one day. The worlde is blearde with duskyng shoes, and daselde with a glose: But I appeale vnto the wyse, and craue redresse of those. Come what can come, howe muche can come, I am at staye in mynde: Theyr net of zeale, wherwith they steale, for euer to vnwynde Since God and our liege Soueraigne bulwarkes to Truthe doo stande: We feare not Commodus his crafte, nor Pertinax his hande. The sixte Satire [of Horace]. The Poet rebuketh those whiche do commende vices in the nobilitie, and do iudge suche worthie to bear rule, as also those whyche thinke, that none base borne oughte to haue any accesse to promotion. He speaketh to Mæcenas, and commendeth hym as one whyche hath respect onely to vertue and godly qualities. Not due discent from haughtie house, nor thyne Hetrurie lande, (Myne owne good Lord) doth cause thy name and honour styll to stande. Not fathers syre not mothers syre two cheuetant sin the fielde: (About whose banners suche a route of lustye bloods bare shielde.) Induce thee to be insolent. (as moste of gentrie be) To make a mocke of meaner men, for thou acceptest me. Whose father was infranchised, and sayste, if dothe not skyll Of petigree, so that oure owne demeanour be not yll. Of this full well thou arte resolude Tullus a soppressor of vertue.before kyng Tullie gan So tyrannous a monarchie imbecelyng freedome, than By vertues spray, the basest borne myght be the noblest man. Leuynus a great gentleman hated of the people for his naughtynes notvvithstandinge the great admyrati? they haue to gentry. Leuinus, he whose ancestours kyng Tarquine droue away: Through lyfe corrupt, and rainlesse youth dyd worke his fames decay. Neglected of the commoners, who onely doo admyre Nobilitie, and none but them to honors would aspyre. If it be so that lawlesse prankes Yea nobles, discommendeth: Who will prayse vs of baser blood except our lyfe amendeth? For what if Leuyn were estemde Decius base borne.and Decie were not so? Leuyn a lowte and Decie stoute, Yet Leuins kyndred tho, Myght be induction to the rude, to deeme of hym so well. If that the counsayles President, Appius.perchaunce should me expell, From Senate house, for vulgar stocke, This colour woulde he make, That base must byde in baser, roume for ciuile profites sake. But glitterynge glorie rauisheth the poore and princely state: And pleasurs not a iote at lengthe: lette Tullie spell his fate He myght haue past hys tyme in peace declinyng lordly lyfe, His royall robes rasde rancour vp, and rancoure termelesse stryfe. Suche is the worlde, who beares the swey assuredly is scande, Howe he came vp what parentage, what was his fathers lande. For as the yonger that would seme moste hansome and moste braue, Dothe make the mo to marke the more if he suche features haue: So who so thinks to rule in realmes, and aufull swey to beare, To place, displace, to dubbe, disdubbe, to kepe the costes in feare: The riflyng of his petigree, muste thynke erewhyle to heare. Durste thou (say they) a beggers brat, in suche outtakyng rage Take on thee thus to heade the peare, to hang, and drawe the page? Nouie woulde be a counsayler, Nouie a petisobber Paulus &amp; Massala. in lawe I passe hym farre. Though not lyke some of fyled tongue to parle a case at barre, But, he can sett a face of it, with his forpenned tayle, In solemne syghtes he thunders so, that fauters neuer fayle. Lette me speake well, speake what I can, They laugh me styll to scorne: He is to base to rule (saye they,) in deede to basely borne. Nowe grudge they me, because I am becomde your houshold guest: Before, because in warre and fielde my rule was nexte the beste. Thyngs muche vnlyke for be it so, that honours enuyde be, As fortunes gyftes, yet maye I well be suppliant to the: Whiche art by choyce of ponderyng witte, of frendes prouided (lo) Not roumerakers, nor rente rackers, nor staynde with vices mo. I dare not saye that fortune coulde haue wrought me suche a blisse, Not loreles chaunce, but Virgils lore, dyd helpe me vp to this. First Virgils voyce, then Varies prayse your presence dyd procure: At myne income, I lowted lowe, And muttred full demure, For bashefull shame dyd styll my voice, and muche abridge my talke: Therfore in blasing of my bloode, my tongue it dothe not walke. Nor how that I doo mount on mule, in countrey gawyshe games: I platly power out my mynde, thou answere also frames In briefe and fewe, suche is thy wont. and after certayne dayes, Thou calls me home, and calls mee frende, and thus my griefe alayes. A ioy to haue Mæcene my frende, who good from bad doth parte, Not by dissente, but lyfe wel led, and ballaste breast with arte. For if with slender single sinnes and those but very few, My vpright nature be infecte: (as if in cumlye hue A warte or twayne be euidente) it is not muche to rue. If gayngroper or muckmunger, I can not proued be, Nor spente my youth in daliaunce, the case is well with me. And be in charitable lyfe, with all and euery frende: I thancke my father for this gere, he sente me to this ende. Flauius.He sente me not to lawyers shop: to learne accoumpts to caste, To be recorder, auditor, to know to fetche in faste: Nor as the gentles sende their sonnes, to chatter in a plea, Professing law, learne lawlesse lyfe, and sayle in riotes Sea. But lyke the babes of noble birthe, to Rome I was conducted, With lordly artes that might be seeme the beste, I was instructed. My garments suche, retinue suche that most men did beleue, My gransyres goodds did stay the route, that hangde vppon my sleue. My maister graue, well studied, and much vnlyke a sorte Who dissolute at eche smale suite, do let their youth go sporte. For few, as tip of all good name he taughte me shamfastnes, That shendful shame through worde or fate did neuer me oppresse, Not fearing, though I wente to lawe, on him I shoulde complaine, Nor doe: I can him hartye thancke, and praise him, for his paine. Except I madde, I may be glad, eke of my parente base, And do mislyke such kynd of skuse which sum vse in this case. Pardie (say they) not our faulte is, our parage is so meane: Pardye, say I, my voyce and heart doth go against that cleane. For if that nature woulde and coulde reclayme my dulcet dayes, And bid me picke my parents out, mongst those, that beares the swayes, Sum would no doubte did me take one, that liftes the loftye mace, And praunceth in the purple throne: contented with my place I woulde not chaunge: the moste of men, wil thincke me straughte of witte, But you, can wey the waightie state, and iudge a ryghte of it. For as auctoritie is greate, so substaunce must be greate, My viaundes greate, my charges greate, my frendes I muste intreate, Som, one, or other, must I haue where so that I be gone, To towne or countrye farre or neare, a shame to be alone. My meny muche, my traine of men, my geldings fatte and fayre, My waggons, coches, horselitters, for coste I muste not spare. In cytie, I must set vppon me golde bespangled mule, In deeper way, a trounsinge steede, whome vneth ought can rule. Els sum will checke me for my thryfte, Lorde Tullus so woulde thriue, Who Pretor would ride through the streetes, his trayne no more but fyue. Fyue peltinge laddes, (good senator) at least must wayte on the, And I may rome my mastershipp, wheresoeuer lyketh me. My selfe alone can chepen things, and make my market well, At euen, and morne, in fayre, or marte from thence to where I dwell: To suche pore cates, as I well lyke, my supper reddie set, A pott of drinke, a glasse of oyle, my housholde stuffe not greate. From that to bed, not crampte with care, of that whiche may betyde, Nor bente to go a pilgremage, for my greate stryfe or pryde. I ryse at ease, walke forth at ease, and then a caste at booke, All secretly, (a ioy of ioyes at it to syt and loke) For weryed with my bookishe gase, I noynte with supple oyle, My loytrous limmes and when sir Phebe with brande beginnes to broyle: I washe my corps in cooly shade, my dyat smale and thin, Of pretie pittaunce, not so muche as stomacke woulde let in. I calculate the coursinge starres, how eche doth run, and rayne, When noysom dogge doth flame in rage, I cum not at the bayne, But sytt at home: this is the lyfe, so iollye, and so free, That cherisheth and cheareth vp, and so recumforts me. As though my father, grandfather, and vncle erste had bene, Lordes treasurers, and lefte me knighte, and ryche in chyldhood grene. The seuenth satire [of Horace]. A DERISION OF CHIDING and brawling. The strife is betwixte Rupilius kyng of Preneste, and one Persius: a wonderfull vndecente thyng, for a noble man to be a scoulder. The fellone tongue of Rupilie, that traytor mungrill kyng, How Persius hath dreste in kynde, it is no nouell thyng. As common as the carts way that. This Persie for the moste, Did make his bode at Ginnia: with Rupilie at hoste With gybes, and glickes, and taunting strife a brawler sharpe and sore Rashe, arrogante, and by vse had of ribaldrye suche store: That from a dosen cacklinge drabbes, the bell he mighte haue bore. Well, to the kynge lyke dogge, and catte, these two did then agree, Lyke champions fell, their toylesum tongues they vsde as weapons free. For eche man seekes to noy his foe, (the olde fayde saw doth tell,) With prowes, and those martiall feats, wherein he doth excell. Twixte Priams hautie Hector, and corragiouse Achill, So keene and mortall was their wrathe, that he did Hector kyll. And for no other cause I trow, but that, in those same twayne, Lyke force in principallitie, and parfytnesse did raine. Dasterds will quickly parte them selues, vnequall if they be, (As Glaucus was to Diomede) the weaker shrinketh, he Departs in peace as recreante, his ransom maks him free. Lorde Brutus was lyeutenaunte, then of Asia the lesse, When Rupilie, and Persius, to combat do addresse, Lyke as two masters of the fence, vnshethe their blades of mighte, So these same two, tongue puisaunte knyghts, with scoulding ginn the fyghte. The auditorye numberouse, the Persie onset gaue, The people laugh, he praiseth Brute, and his retenue braue. Duke Brute, the sonne of Asia, his men he cals the starres, Balde Rupilie he rattles vp, to combat if he darres. He calde him hurtefull hatefull dogge, to earthe, a greeuouse signe, FlovvteLyke pleasaunte streame beset with woode, so flowes his talke diuine. Then Rupile let issue out, his well ycouched wordes, Throughseasonde, as the drubled lakes, that keepeth aye in fordes. So perfyt and exacte a scoulde, that women mighte geue place, Whose tatling tongues, had won a wispe, to stande before theyr face. A railers t?g insupportable, therefore not to be aunsvvered by vvordes, but repressed by rigor of the maiestrate.The Persie see his foe so fell, and how he did him snape, Thoughte impossible to resiste, ne wiste he how to scape. Lorde Brute (quod he) my liege lord Brute, for all the gods aboue, Thou that arte wonte to hasserd all, to win thy countryes loue, To wringe the maces forth their handes, to daunte the dukes a downe, Be wrekde, be wrekde (thy onely prayse) vpon this doggishe clowne. The eight Satyre [of Horace] The gardine God Priapus beinge erected as a vvatche to driue avvaye byrdes and theues, complaineth hym selfe to be sore scarred of the olde vvitche Canadie, her fellowe sorcerers Sagana, and suche lyke. He partlye toucheth the maner of their practisynge. I was sumtimes a very blocke, the bodye of a tree, The wryght vncertaine what to make a stoole, or God of me, His pleasure was to make me God, mine office is to fray Both birdes &amp; theues, that wold cum filtche our fruite from hence awaye. As images (most commonly) the woorkemen vse to make, To purchase ease, or wealthe to men, and for their lucre sake. This orcharde was a sepulchre indeede, a publique graue, For Nomentane and Pantolabe and euerye rascall slaue. The plat of ground, was brode and square, and of a mightie lengthe, Sum tombes there were righte beautifull, and of a during strengthe. This place that was a dampishe soyle, and whyte, with dead mens bones, Is now a pleasaunte paradise, to walke in for the nones. The veluet grasse, the holsom herbes, the trees in motley lyuerie, Both arte and nature haue bestowde, abundantlye their tapestrye. I am molested very muche with fowles, and cleekynge theues. Yet moste these charmynge sorcerers, vndoubtedly me greues: Who doe with poyson, and with spells, bereue men of their witts: I can not stay these mother mabbes, but they will charme by fyttes. When as the moone beginnes to shew her younge and cumlye face, They cum to gather deade mens bones, and hurtefull herbes a pace. Canadie a vvitche.I saw my selfe olde Canadie, about twelue of the clocke, Bare foote, hyr lockes about her heade, Ytuckde in pukishe frocke. She howled with on other hagge, a coolor sallow man Made them to looke, lyke gastefull goosts, (good for to curse and ban) These two with teeth did rente in twaine a lambe of blackishe hue, The blood resorted to an hole, purple, and smoking new. Thence did they cyte the damned soules, from Plutos pallace large: The soules, that al things should expounde, as it was geuen in charge. Stode statues two, the greate of wull, of wax was made the lesse, The greater gurnde with visage grim, as thoughe he woulde oppresse The lesse, which lowred lowtishlye, dispairinge all redresse. The one she calde of Hecatie, Kinge Plutos chamber feare, The other calde Tisephonie, that hath in spite no peare, Feindes, serpentes, furyes, hellish impes. the moone inflamde to reade, Thou mightes haue seene, the witches couch behynde the tombes of deade For beinge spyde, If that I lye, the dawes defyle my noule, And all the theues of Rome cum in, and of my fruite take toule. What shoulde I shew particulers? by course how they did speake, The witche and goosts how they dyd houle, againe how they did squeake, How they enterred in the grounde a speakled serpentes hyde: And hare of woolfes, and by and by a flame there out did glyde. And as the flame did grow in bulke, and gan for to increase: So did the waxen image (lo.) by smale and smale decrease. I markte the drabbishe sorcerers, and harde their dismall spel. The matter went so harde with me, (there was no other boote) I let a scape? Dame Cannadie she moude her aged foote, And trotteth on her way so harde, that all her teethe out fall: The other Trot lost her read hyue, she hid her bushe with all. There mightes thou fynde theyr coniurde hearbes, their threades, and knackes of arte, And for to see the beldams scarde, haue laughed out thy parte. The nynthe Satyre [of Horace] In generall he controwleth people inquisitiue, and importunable tatlers, That he doth dialogue wyse, and yet wythout namynge of any person. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Str. read Strange For Ho. read Horace I chauncd, to roome me in the streetes, (as ofte I vse to doe) Musing, I wote not of what toyes, but scanninge to and froe. Runs vnto me a certaine man, whome erste I vnneth see. Imbracing me, oh pleasaunte lad, how mightes thou fare (quod he?) Horace. Well at this tyme, and wish to the, all that thou canste require. When as I see him haunte me still, I askde him his desyre. Str. Why pardye syr, know you not me? I am a greate lernde man. Horace. If it be so, I deme of you, so muche the better than. Lyues fayne, I would haue lefte him there, and heruppon, I wente Now swifte, now slow, and told my boy trifles to none intente. In faith I was through bathde in sweate, and thoughte them in good case, That were well in theyr chamber set, or in sum secret place. When he would praise the towne, or strets, I answerd nought againe. I see, (quod he) you would that we were parted very faine. But all for naught, it may not be, Ile wayte vpon you now. (Quod I) syr spare your coortesie, I haue no nede of you. I must goe se, a frende of mine, whom you did neuer know, Nye Cesars Orchardes, yonde Tyber he dwelleth farre below, Strange. No busnes I, nedes muste I walke, haue with you for this day, Horace Then (like the heuye lodened asse) mine eares downe did I lay, Str: Syr if you knew my qualities, there is no reason why, Or Viske, or Varus should be more, entire to you then I. Viske, and Varus tvvo iolye Poets: For who, for number or for grace, dare mell with me in ryme? Or who can daunce so footingly, obseruing tune and time? I can singe so melodiouslye, that very Hermogene Would enuy me, or if he harde would yeld to me I wene. Ho: I thought to interchaunge a worde, thy mother liueth she, Or any of thy kynsfolke els, that standeth nede of the? Str: In good time they are brought to stay, and I remaine alone, Horace Dispatche thou me, so it must be: for many yeres a gone, Sabella a Prophetes. Sabella (I a very childe) did reede my drerye fate, In folowinge forme, with tendre hande, pressed vpon my pate. Not poyson keene, nor enmies sworde, this babe awaye shall draw, Not stitche, or coughe, or knobbing gowt, that makes the patiente slaw, A prater shal becom his death, therefore, let him alwayes If he be wise, shun iangling iackes, after his youthful dayes. We came to Lady Vestas churche, the fourth part of the day Whilst language passed to and fro, was passed cleane away. He stode in bondes, (as he tould me) in courte for to appere, Or sentence els definitiue should passe against him cleare. If thou dost loue me frend (quod he) to th' arches with me drawe. Horace: Nor can I stande vpon my feete, nor know the cyuile Lawe. Str: I doubt if I shoulde leaue my cause, or els thy frendlye companie. Horace, I pray the me, not yet (quod he.) before me, by and by He preseth on: my victor guide I do succede a pace, How doth your Lord Mæcenas now, how stand you in his grace? Str: It is a rare and wittye parte, in frendship long to dwell, Horace, I tel the as a frend, thou hast vsd fortune well, If that thou woldste plante me in once, (in forfitte of my heade) Thou shouldste no doubte, haue me a frende, woulde stande the in good steade. Within a monethes space or twaine, Mæcenas I woulde claw That all the reaste mighte blow theyr nayles, or go to shough the dawe. Horace. We lyue not so, as thou doste thincke, no house, more pure then this, Nor none, that from those mischeues vyle, more cleane and spotles is. His riches, or his learnyng is no preiudice to me: There is a place accordingly, for eche in his degree. Str. A thinge thou tells vncredible. Hor. I tell a sothefast tale, Str. Thou makes me glow faine woulde I cum to be of his counsaile. Hor. If that you will, you haue a grace, his fauour for to win: The first assaulte is very harde, by suite thou maiste get in. Str. I will not fayle brybes shall corrupte his cheefist seruing men: Though once or twice the gates be shut I will not cease yet then: Ile wayte my opportunitie, to meete him in the ways, To leade him home, to curtsey him, and cap him when he stayes. There is no good for to be done, whilste we are lyuyng here: Excepte we lye, faune, flatter, face, cap, kneele, ducke, crouche, smile, flere. He pratlyng thus, a frende of mine one Fuscus Aristie, Met me, who knew this chatting syr almoste as well as I. Stocke stille we stande, he askde my whence, or whether that I woulde: I haylde him backe, and by the hand, of frendship did him houlde. Squinting his eys, he gan to nod, to call me thence away, And yet dissemblingly he thoughte, to dallye and to play My harte in choller perboylde was: I wis my frende (quod I) You sayd, that you a matter had to tell me secretly. Fuscus. An other tyme. I muste go see the circumcised Iues In keeping of their Saboth day, what holye rytes they vse. Horace I loue not that religion. Fuscus I, of infirmitie Am scrupulouse: and therfore syr, I pray the beare with me. Herrafter I wilbe your man, both when and where you will, This day dismis me to go roume, throughout the streets my fill. Hor. The churle departes and left me stille to feele my sharpe distresse. By chaunce there cums this fellowes foe, who nowe had got redresse At him by law: varlet, (quod he) I charge the for to stay, And pray you (Horace) geue me leaue, my mynde to him to say. Content (quod I) you may be bould, to worke your will for me, My troblesum companion arested then I see. Both parties cry, the croude growes greate through great Appollos grace, It was my lucke for to escape. so comberouse a case. The tenthe satire [of Horace] Some Had Euil spoken of Horace for reprehendinge Lucille. he protesteth that he by no meanes, meaneth to defame the person, but to haue his, or their doinges bettred. Pretie other conceites and notes of versefying Forsoth, I said, (Lucill) I said, your verses run not rounde. Doth any loue Lucill so wel, to praise his iarring sound? But he through tickling vp the towne, with mirth hath wun a name: And yet this doth not proue him lernde though I should graunt the same. So might our minstrell Laberie Laberie delectable in minstrelsey, and yet not learned. be coumpted learned than, If merye mirthe, and onlye mirthe, could make a learned man. To make the reader laugh a pace, is not a Poets part: I meane not all: though therin be a pretie pece of art. He must be quick to make his pause, and sentence fall in time Els tracting long, to weryed eares, wil make a lothsum rime. His treatice interchaungeable: now merye and now sad, In Poets puffe, and now againe in Retorique florish clad. Sumtimes a fable trimly tould doth worke in better force. Then if the plaintife Poet should besing his musies horce. Sumtime to spare his eloquence, and speake not what he can: Such were the auncient interludes, so wher they liked than. And so farre to be imitate: but neyther Hermogen Demetrius:Nor other, who would seeme to be, so gay deuising men, Did euer reade (I dare make good) those lettred Poets workes, Saue Catul, and Caluus, wheras such paltrye baggage lurkes, Tush, now I glaunce, and blame amis for Lucill hath deuised A tricksye woorke in Lattin coate, and greakishe gardes comprised. An auntrus act, I promise you, O thou that knowes not much, Cease to admire a man for that, the matter is not suche As it is thought, to sprincle here and there a worde of greeke, Sum assehead doultes in baggish style, of greeke are not to seeke. Excepte thou thincke that diuerse tongues are better when they meete, As mixed wynes, (what els?) become more wholsome and pure swete. Well, in thy verse vse Greeke at wil, beware, that when at barre Thou pleadest for thy clyent, there Petillus: thou goest not ouerfarre. I meane as if some passing man shouldst and in plea thy foe, And sweate againe to grauaile the, Publicula or Coruinus: and worke thy clyent woo, Use not thy two tongude phrases then, like one of Canues towne, Canues a tovvne vvhere vvas spoken both greeke and Latin: Thou maist perchaunce become non suite, thou and thy cause borne downe. Once on a time, a Greek poeme I dreamed to indite, (A Romaine I disioynde by sea, vnured so to write) Lord Romulus did byd me stinte, in pitchye silent night, At midnight, when suche vysions are coumted most of might. In grekish tongue (sayeth he) to write write vpon writinge still, Is as to powre on fatted sowe, more draffe drinke and more swill. Therfore whylst Alpine shriketh out Alhin a tragicall Poet. the murdred Memnons baine And Rhene descriues, I leauing Greeke am of my Satyres fayne. Which neyther shall in Guyldhall once, be iudged of the Mayre: Nor fede the eye on stately stage, to make a meyny stare. Fundanus may at his good lust, Fundanus a comical Poet: of ninctie fyncties write, (I say) of harlots heedful guile, of Dauus what a spite He wrought to Chremes by his crafte, That facultie therfore I leaue to him as capitaine in scoffing comike lore. And Pollio, the princely iestes, in loftie Iambiques maye By vertue of that gracious verse in tragike wise display: So Varie makes his Elegies, of quick, and liuely might, And Virgill, well in rurall rime, His gamesome Muse can dight: A Satyre I, more sauerly, and with more lucke attempted, Then Varro, and a number such, (al arrogance exempted.) I doo not say, before my time, But Lucille did deuise, Nor euer ment to preiudice Lavvtell Crovvne.his crowne in any wise: But now and then outtakingly, he wil be ouerseene, And bring such stuffe, wherof the most omitted might haue bene. I praye you (Lucille) saie me soothe, nor bee you not offended, Hath not your wisedom said or nowe, that Homer migtt be mended? Actins.And hath not ioly Lucill to the dolefull Actle chaunged? EniusAnd for to carpe him for his phrase al ouer Ennie raunged. Yet when he speaketh of himselfe, He speakes not as he were A better clarke, then those he blamde. Why may not we inquyre In waye of talke? if his harde style, a matter good hath marde: Or if the matter too vntoward, hath made his style to harde. If that a man thynke it enough, and for a Poet mete, Twixt meale and meale, two hundreth rymes, to reare vpon their fete: Lyke Casse, whose lauishe eloquence, Cassus burned for his folishe bokes was rushyng as the streames: Therfore were burnt, his corps, his bookes, (his hastye trauaylde dreames.) If this be good, Lucill is good, in suche respecte may he Of pleasant head, and depe deuice, and clarkly iudgement be. He may be thought to haue enritchde Greace, with his Satyre verse, Muche better then an elder sorte, whiche I coulde nowe rehearse. Ryghte happy Lucill, that dyd see so plausible a tyme: If he had ben in these our dayes, he must haue razde his ryme. And paerd of all that was not trym, and so haue bent his brayne, That bothe he should haue scratchde his heade, and bitte his thombes for payne. For nowe, who lookes to beare the bel, his doyngs he muste cull, Horace, At home with hym, and better adde, then he dyd erste out pull. Contented to haue pleasde the wyse, lette go the skyllesse hobbes, Who woulde esteme the clappynge of a flocke of luskyshe lobbes. (Not I in sooth): the iudgement of one worthy personage, In learnyng rype, in vertue iuste, in verdite sharpe, and sage: Geue me before a thousand lowtes, and all theyr lowde suffrage. Tigell he kepes a prattlynge stille, his pages doo me pynche: Prate what they can, the worste they can, I mynde not once to wynche. Suche carelesse, brainlesse, senslesse shrubbs, suche sucklyng maultwormes who, Doth take their words, but as of course, and so can lette them go? The vvise clerkes of that age.The lorde Mæcenas and Virgill, Plotie, and Varius, Valgie, and our drad soueraigne the greate Octauius, And Pollio (I fawne not nowe, nor flatter, thankes to pyke) Fuscus, and eke the Viscie bothe, I woulde they should me lyke, Thou Messala, thy brother to, You Bubilie also You Seruie, and thou Furnius, both you and suche lyke mo, Frendly, and learnde, which now for hast vnnamed I lett go, Your praise I saye, fayne would I haue, full sorie and full sad: If I ne can fulfyll the hope, whiche of my selfe I had. Sir Tigell, and syr Demetrie, Your dumpishe domes in schooles. You may be stow ther as you liste, emongst your flocke of fooles. As for the wise, they winke at them, nor wil not on them looke: Go boy go note these sayings wel and put them in a booke. Q. HORA. FLACCVS HIS seconde Booke of Satyres. The firste satyre [of Horace] The poet is at Altercation withe himselfe, and reasoneth if hee shoulde anye further procede, in inditynge of Satyres, sithens hee vvas thought of some enuious persones to be sharpe spoken, and indede a backbyter. Hee demaundeth counsell of the lavvyer Trebatius: hee defendeth hys ovvne dede, and conuincethe his misiudgers. Some thinke my Satyres too to tarte, to kepe no constant law, And some haue thought it lously pende what so of mine they sawe. And weane a thousand suche like rimes, one might within a day, Write and dispatche: (old frend Trebate) what would I doo? a way To me prescrbe: you byd me rest, my Musies to appal. Na, trust me truly by my thryfte, that were the best of all. But I must nedes be doing still, you bid me, I know what, To swymme in Tyber all the day at night to kepe a chat. To drinke for life, to quaffe carouse, to loade my tottye noule, And by such meanes restraine my pen, and to surcharge my soule. Or if I haue such vrgent lust, and lyking to indite, That then I should of Cesars fraies and passing triumphes write. For that wold fetche vs in the pence, and helpe me for to liue. Alas (God knowes) full faine would I. my courage wil not geue Me so to doo. Not euery man the warlike troupes so gaye, The morishe pikes, and broching speares, the frenchemen slaine in fray, The puissaunt Percie pluckte from horse praise worthie can displaye. Why might I not iuste Scipio, thy martial feates haue praysed, As learned Lucille once tofore such bloodie bankets blased? I will assaye as time shall serue, vnlesse I waite my time, It is in vaine, to exhibite to Cesar any rime. Whom, if a man attempte to claw, inflexible he standes, Yet, better were so to presume, then for to file our handes With bankroute slaue Pantobolus and Nomentanus prankes Sithe causeles all mistrust them selues, and cannes me little thankes, What way for me? they say, that I am subiecte vnto drinke, And shotishely vppon excesse, lay out what so I thinke: Like dronken folke that hoppe and skippe, when lickour lodes their braine, And when through ill affected eie, one candell semeth twayne. Borne of one egge, Pollux on foote, Pollux and Castor, Iupiter and Ledas sonnes brethren to Helena. and Castor loues to ryde, Eche man his minde. In studying howe many wayes be tryde? I kepe one staye, writinge (they saye) in melancholie moode, Like Lucill, sauing that my witte, is not all out so good. Lucill, as to his very frende, so woulde he to his booke His secretes good or bad bewray, looke on them, who woulde looke. Hym followe I, in Lucanie, or bred in Appulie I wote not: For Venuce my towne Venucinum, iuste betvven Lucanie, and Appulie, ther vvas the poet borne. betwixte them both doth lye. The Romains Venucine possesse, so sente into that place, Leste people nigh abordering might wyn the same in space. And therby noy the Romishe welth, what so my countrey is: What so my wytte, my bytter style strikes not a whytte amis. It may bee lykened to a sworde, In sheathe for my defence. Synce no false losels hurte me then, why doo I drawe it thence? O kyng, O father Iupiter, Woulde God the tymes were so That ruste myght well deuoure this sworde, that none woulde worke me wo. But worke they doo, but who so does, though he be diuelyshe fell, I blason farre and nere his armes, and wanton touches tell. He may go howle, and pule for wo, the citizens will scorn hym, And cause him wyshe full many a tyme, his damme had neuer borne hym. The Lawyer when that he is chaft, will threaten iudgement fell. So Cannadie our sorceresse with poyson will vs quell: Eche officer dothe menace eke, the worste that they can doe: All bragge of that, whiche is theyr best, and therwith feare their foe. And that nature allowes of this. marke thou these notes with me: The wolfe with toothe, the bull with horne. and how this same myght be, Dame Nature teacheth inwardly. thou doste agayne reply, Stronge Sheua wold not with his sworde, his mother cause to dye, Though she had wrought him much mischief. No maruayle, for the oxe Strikes not with tooth, nor wolfe with hele, strong poyson vsde this foxe. So he and they, the good and lewde theyr weapons haue by kynde, And vse the same to worke theyr weale: the gyftes therfore of mynde Shall be my beste artillerie: For whether quiet age Abydeth me, or blacke wyngde death encompasse me in rage, Come wealth or want, at home, or els perchaunce an exilde man, I will not fayle, to write my state, if possiebly I can. Trebare My sonne, if that thou write to sharpe, no doubt thou shalt not liue, Some one or other, wil to the Thy fatall wounde ygeue. Horace. Why? Lucill lyude, who euer vsde, all fayners to detecte With Satyres sharpe, and quippies rounde, of death he neuer reckt. But blamed those, which outwardly do geue a shyning shoe, And inwardly are chargde with sinne, that vnnethes they can goe. Good Lelie did not hate his witte, not he that got renowne For pollecie, and pruice too. For beating Carthage downe. I say they were not miscontent, That lewde Metellus once, Metellus and Lupus noble men, yet reprehended for vice: Scipio and Lelius not repyning: And lowtishe Lupus were reformde, with Satyres for the nonce. He would not spare the officers, nor priuate men to blame. A frende to none saue honestie, and those that vse the same. With doughtie stoute duke Scipio, and Lelie learnde and wise, One point of vvisedom, not to be mery amongst a multitude: He woulde ieste very iocondlye, and franckly in his guise, At meales when he sequestred was from the vnlettred sort. What so I am, though farre I wote from Lucils witte and port. Yet enuie selfe cannot denie, but I haue ledde my life Amongst the beste, though some men thinke me dedicate to strife: Me thinks my grounde is good and sure, except you frende Trebate, By law doo disalowe of it, I wil pursue my state. Trebate Beware, beware, the warnde may lyue, be circumspect, and slawe, Leste you by wordes vndoo your selfe, through ignorance of lawe. For who that writeth slaundrously, we lawyers must amend him: Hor. And who that writeth true and well, our Cesar must defend him: If that a man speake of a zeale, And blame the bad alone, Dispatche your rowles, ther is no gaine, the Lawyer may be gone. The second satire [of Horace] Vnder the Personage of the stoike Ofellus, hee controlleth the gluttonous and riottous: he shevveth the variatie of meates them selues, not to be so dilectable, as they are so made by abstinence, and sharpe appitite. He commendeth much frugalitie, which is chiefly in sparing and thryftie diete. Howe good it is, and laudable, to liue but with a small: It passeth me for to discriue. Ofellus told it all. A rudesvie, and vnruly, wyse, and yet vnlucky man, Who neuer could bring to an ende, The thinge which he began. Learne abstinence, O learne of me not when your paunche is full, Or when with grosse vpflynging fumes, Your syght is masde and dull: Or when your luste leanes to the worst, and wyll not brooke the beste, Come soberly, not ouerchargde, with intrayls all at reste. Some thing to say: the wastefull wombe, dothe plague and kill the brayne: As that iudge dothe his countrey hurt, who gapeth after gayne. When thou doste trace the hastyng hare, or tame the Iennet wylde, Or fight in fielde, lyke Romayn stoute, (vnlyke a Grekyshe chyld,) Or when thou doest at footebal playe, or tennice for pastyme: Whylste loue of game doth ease thy toyle, and helpe awaye the tyme: Or when thou slyngest in the ayre: with might auoyde the stone: What so thou doste, do earnestly, and when thy toyle is gone, Thou shalt haue stomake quick and sharpe, that when thou comes to dyne, It will not loke for sweete conceites, or fragrant friskyng wyne, If that the rude and vgly sea, do lette the fyshers arte, If foode doo fayle, of breade and salte, to take and eate thy parte Thou wilt be glad. Why is it thus? Howe soundeth this wyth reason? The smell of hoate and smokyng roast, though it be deare and geason, Doth not delyte of it owne selfe: thou makes the culleis good. Thy sweate and pyne makes sweete and fyne, and sauours all thy food. What taste is there, yf thou beiste gordgde? ne can it well endue, In Lampre, or in Leueret, or choppyn oysters newe. Nathelesse, I can not thee perswade, but yf they both be dreste, The Pecocke, and the pubble hen, the Pecocke tasteth best. Begyled wyth apparances: because her costly sayle Is rare: and that a circled pryde she beareth in her tayle. As though that were materiall: her feathers dost thou eate So gaye to thee? or is she ells, in brothe the better meate? The fleshe of bothe is muche alike: thou loues the pecocke tho, Because of gallant gawyshe plumes: well, lette it then be so. Tuscus, a strete in Rome, nere to a creke of the sea,The dogge fyshe, that from Tyber cums, or streame in Tuscus streete, Why is it worse, then that, from sea, where wrastlynge waues doo meete? O doting worlde, aboue the rest, they loue the Mullet greate, And yet doo mynce her smale and smale before they doo her eate. Thus may we see, the sight is all: If sight may things excell, Great Porposes should be in price: na, sothly I can tell Why they be not: this Porpose fyshe, with vs is euery where: A Mullet for the mincing dames, for that is rare and dere. Farre sought, and deare bought good for Ladyes: The temperate will litle eate and fede of simple chere. Some gluttons would eate greater fishe, to satisfye their mawes, (Like hellishe Harpies) from a panne, with gredie gnawing iawes. But you, you wastfull southerne windes corrupt their viandes all: It endes not much: for Bore or Brytte dost tast to them as galle. When to much hauocke hath them cloyde, then gyn they sore to longe For Rapes and Helicampane roote, and do the beggers wrong. So kinges (to haue their courses iust) Reiect not pore mens cates, As egges and oyle, with such the lyke receaude and vsde of states. The Heraulde Gallo for a dishe He vsde vpon a day, The dishe was a fishe cavvled Accip?ser a vvhile vsuall yea and noble, aftervvard contemptible: Was ill rebukde. But they to blame: for Brtttes fewe durst assay The Brit did scope abrode in seas, The Storke did kepe her nest, Before paunche pampring Pretorie told how they should be drest. If some the rosted Cormoraunt, Pretorie a frend to the kychin, delytefull would report, Oure youthe (soone taughe to naughtynesse) would trye it for a sporte. The couetous and sparinge man we must not note for one, (As Ofell sayth) if thou percase from one sinne wouldste be gone, And therby happe into a worse, that were a bootlesse case. Canis, in whome for his desert, Canis a couetouse miser, Oulde olyuesthat name may well take place, Olde Oliues, add the dogtree fruicte, and lees of chaunged wine, And vyle vnpleasaunt greasye oyle, to lothesome for a swine. (If he did feaste his frende at home, or kepe his natiue day, Or solemnise the time by chaunce, One good note of a churl to be liberal of that vvhich is naught: Demaunde:in surely rych arraye) Abundance of such corrup stuffe, Mongst his, he would outlaye. What dyet shall the wise man then, twixt two contraries vse? Shal he the trade of couetouse, or prodigall refuse? Unspotted he, that kepes him fre, and leanes to neither syde. Replye:He shall not be like Albutye, who, when he doth deuide, AlbutyeHis houshold charge emongst his men himselfe will nothing doo: Neuye:Nor yet like Neuie wayte at boorde, for that is foolishe too. Now lysten well, how great the fruictes, of sparing diete be, First good for healthe, for this thou muste perswade thy selfe with me: That many things annoyeth man, And meates do muche offende, Though they be pleasant, yea and good yet, when thou doste them blende, As fyshe with fowle, roste meates, with boylde, to choler goes the sweete: The moyst to fleume, for stomacke fleume a guest is moste vnmete. Agayne the corps chargde with excesse, dothe ouercharge the mynde, Abandonnyng to earthly things, the soule of heauenly kynde. The temperate may soone dispose his members to their reste, And ryse agayne delyuerly, to labour quicke and preste. He shall be in the better plyte, In tyme that happen may, As when the yeare by compaste course, shall bryng the pagiaunt day. Or if he take confortatiues to helpe hym at his neede: VVorthy frutes of temperance. For yeares wyll come, and crasye age, who daintily must feede. In age or sycknesse, what shall be, delityng vnto thee? Who haste preuented in thy youth suche pleasure as myght bee? The rammyshe Bore, they wont to prayse, not that they had no nose To feele hym smell, but to this ende, that he whiche dyd repose Hym selfe with them, might egerly fall to, and eate his meate: Because they woulde not gluttonlyke, theyr whole prouision eate In those dayes, I woulde haue ben borne, in suche an honeste tyme: I loue well hospitalitie, If riot cause not crime. If thou dost stande in awe of verse, or force a rymers reede: Take heede, such sortes, and subtilties of cates wyll make thee neede. Bothe shame and harme they wyll procure, agayne, adde to this same, Thy kynsmen wroth, thy frends made foes thy selfe foe to thy name. Wyshyng for death, and shalt not dye, but lyue to wayle and mone Thy wanton wealth, thy beggers plight thy treasures that be gone. Trasie(Saythe tauntyng Trasy) maye not I lay out my coyne at wyll? My rentes come to me thicke and thicke, my want is foyson still, Not three kynges can dispende with me, who sayth, I may not spende? Poet.Therfore, the surplus of thy goodes applye to better ende. Why wante the silly needie soules refreshyng at thy hande? Why doo the temples of the gods, without repayryng stande? Thou corsye carle, thy countrey dere, from hougie substance suche Shall she haue naught: wylt onely thou deuoure alone so muche? O ieste, vnto thy very foes, For, whether may haue more, (If fortune frowne, and grefes growe on) esperance to his store? Thou: which was maried to thy mucke, and freshe in gay attyre, Or he: that dreading chaunce to cum, a litle doth desyre, And keepes it well, and warylye to helpe in hopelesse tyde: Lyke as the wyse in golden peace for stormye warre prouide. For more beleefe in this behalfe, I then a little boy Can now reporte, that Ofellus, put not so greate a ioy, Nor pleasured so in his cheefe wealthe, Ofels talke in prosperitie as in his worste decay. This was a common talke of his when he bare greateste sway. Alls one to me: on woorkyday I neuer coulde be taken With better meate, in feelde or towne, then roots or chimnye bacon. I and my sonnes keepe thus in feilde, our cattell seelde forsaken. But if some old acquaintaunce cum, Horace, A more honest kynde of liberalitie. who hath bene longe away, Or sum good honest neyghboure els through sletie drisling day Do cease from woorke, we mery make not with suche costlye fyshe, But with a chicken, or a kyd, and grapes our seconde dishe, A nutte, or els sum kynde of figge: the table tayne awaye We drincke about, and afterwarde for Ceres giftes we pray, So flye awaye the freating cares, that bringe the wimpled age. Let furiouse fortune frowne and fume, and roste hyr selfe in rage, Vmbrenus a souldier vvho had the gro?d geuen him by Augustus.She can not much empayre our cates: my seruauntes haue not founde Their cheare muche woorse sence Vmbrenus hath gotte away our grounde. It matters not, for nature gaue not me this proper lande At firste, nor him, nor any els, he chaste vs forth with hande, His beastelynes will chase him out, or sum expulsiue lawe, Or els his heire that shall suruiue, when he muste couche full lawe Now Vmbrens grounde, of late Ofells (a thing not very stable) Now myne, now thine, so muste we take, the worlde as variable. Let nothing cause your courage quayle, in care be constante stille, And bende your brestes to beare the blowes of fortune that be ille. The thirde Satyre [of Horace] The Poet sheweth a greate skill or vvorkemanshipp in this Satyre, especially in that the earnestlye studying to make others good, is himselfe partelye contented to be controwled by the stoick Damasip, as a sluggarde, and pretermiter of duetifull occasions. The stoicke proues sinne to be a certaine kynde of madnesse. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Dama. read Damasip For St. or Sto. read Stoicke For Agam. and Agamem. read Agamemnon For Tew read Tucer Damasip. You write so seldom vnto me, that fowre times in a yeare Scarse cums a pen within your hands, perusinge written geare. Halfe angrie with your selfe I weane, that drente in wine and slepe, You spending time in sylent pause, of Satyres beres no keepe. Performe thy promis once at lengthe, goe to, what shall we haue? Thou coms from Saturnes feast I trowe from drinke thy selfe to saue. Wil nothing be? You blame your muse, so do your Poets all Accuse your pen, when to your minde, your sentence will not fall. When thou camst to the countrye towne, to liue a part from strife, Thy visage gaue, as thoughe thou wouldste haue written bookes or life. Menander and dan Platos woorkes, why do they on you wayte? Why brought you Eupolis to towne, and Archilog his mate? You meane for feare of spitefull folke, all vertue to disclame, Thou caytife shalt com to contempt, shun idle ioyes for shame: Or els surrender all such praise, as thou hast got before: By worke of witte, in full intent The Poet content to be reproued but not at suche a peuishe Marchaunt as This stoike damasip. to mell with it no more, For this sage counsaile, (Damasip) the heauenly goddes I pray, To send a barber speedely, to wype your berde awaye. Horace In dede, and know you me so well how coms it so to passe? Damasip, I sufferd shipwracke of my goodes, whilst I a merchaunt was. And therfore now can spare an eye. the worlde to ouervewe. Then was I plunged in affaires, as they me droue and drew, To know what vantage by exchang, to clippe, and washe my goulde. By subtilties in mineralles, my state for to vphoulde. By such lyke sorte came I to haue an ample wealthie share, To purchasse orchards for mine ease and bowers bright and fayre. My witte so deepe soe sore to deale, such lucke to win, or saue, That me a Mercurialiste, to surname then they gaue, Horace I know it well and maruaile muche, If that be ridde and gone: Except thou hast sum worse diseas whiche needes wyl raine alone. As Phisikes cure from head to brest, diseases can conuey, As by excesse of much madnes, dryue lythargie away. Perchance you setting fraude a part, the mad mans part wil play. Dama, Frend Horace, you are mad likewise, And so is euery foole, If stoicke Stertein taught vs once, true doctrine in his schoole. Of whome, I learnde this trade of lyfe, no trewande in my lore, He dubde me then a stoick Stage, and bad me morne no more. Though al the worlde shoulde go to wracke, (for from a brydge I ment All headlonge to haue horlde my selfe so things againste me wente.) Approchinge nygh, O do not so, frende Damasip (quod he) What thirlinge throwes doth twitch thy harte? The stoicke Startine supplyeth with his talke almoste all the satyre folowinge. what shame confoundeth the? The people cawle thee giddishe mad, why, all the worlde is so: If thou be mad, and thou alone be drounde: I lette the goe. But what is madnes to defyne? Crysip that noble clarke, Cals all fooles mad, and all whose mindes are duskde with errours darke. This rule makes mad a noumberouse swarme of subiects and of kinges, And none exemptes, saue those in whome the well of wysdome springes. Now leane thyne eares, and listen well, perceaue howe all be mad, Yea those who earste to make the woorse, such mockeries haue had. Admit there be through darkesum wood a speedie footepathe way, On ryghte syde sum, on lefte syde sum and all do go a stray Through wilsumnes of wildernes: the error is all one, Though through miswandringe diuerslye, they diuerslye haue gone. A reason to proue al map, vvhich treade not in one true footepath of vvisedome.Thou maist be mad, (frend Damasipp) thou maiste be muche vnwyse, Thy mockers staringe mad also, though in an other guyse. One manner frensie is, to feare when nothinge is a misse, As hilles on plaines, or seas on mountes, this kynde of bugg, or this, An other like a desperate, nothing at all to feare, To trudge through deepe, high, hoate, and coulde, to prease vppon a speare. His frendes reclames, his sister deare, his parentes, and his wyfe, Theirs rockes, theirs Seas, greate dread (say they) sweete kinsman saue your lyfe. He will not heare, for all their crye, no more then Fusie coulde When he through force of drowsie drinke, was falne in slumber coolde. He shoulde recite the drunkards parte, he druncke his parte away, The people egde him for to speake, he wiste not what to say. One way or other all are mad, as Damasip, which oulde Pictures did bye was mad, and he that lente to him the goulde. Moste mad is he, that takes a truste, not hauinge hope to pay: Moste mad is he, which may make boulde and dare not his assay. Assay (quod you) but who woulde truste, for now the worlde is suche, That lende a man, a thousand crownes, or more, or nye so muche, And take a bil of his hand write, an obligation make, So lawyer like, so clarklie drawne that none could it mistake, And bynde him straite to kepe a daye in paine of marks and poundes, Shew witnes, write, and what thou canst or lowse, or shake thy groundes Th' one will he do: like Proteus to shapes ychaunged, he Somtime a Bore, a birde, a stone, and when he list a tree. No doubt he wil attempt all shiftes, to shift him self from the. If wise men vse for to do well, and fooles for to do ill, What say you to our creditor, our vsurer Petill. Petill vsurer Is he not mad? whoo when he lendes, for increase, asketh more Then the pore debter can performe, though he should swelt therfore, Ye lecherouse, luxuriouse, ye supersticiouse: Ye shottishe, dotishe, doultish dawes, that nothing can discusse, Draw on my Clyents one by one, be not agreist ne sad, Stand stil in stound, kepe whishte (I say) whilst I do proue you mad. I charge you, you Ambitious, and you that mucker good, To gerde your gownes, to sit and harcke whilst I do proue you wood. The couetouse, of Helibore the greater part must haue, One parte of a mad man to seeke vayne glory after his death:Or rather all the pilles, for th' heade as they which most do raue. Th' executoures of Staberie, engrayled on his graue, What were his ample legaces, and what to them he gaue, For so he bad in testament, and if they would not so, That then to maintaine sworde plarot,) most of his goodes should goe. Areus superuisor of the vvill: Arrey did superuise this will: who should geue them in wheate, To preserue sport, as much as halfe a countrye could well eate. Staberie What though I did (inisiudge menes I had a wittye meaning. Stoicke: No doubte you had, to this intent was all his gilefull gleaning. To haue his heyres engraiue in stones his honnorable will: Neade was to him a wickednes, yea an vngodly ill. Therfore in dede full dredefully. he wayed it as goddes curse: If at his death, then in his life, one dodkin he were worse. For all and euery thinge (quod he) vertue, renoumne, and fame, The corpes, the goste, dothe crouch to coyne and serue vnto the same. Which who so hath all at his lust, him nedes no further thinge He maye bee famouse, stoute, and iuste, a wiseman and a king. And this is euen as good as if by vertue he vp grue: But Staberie or Aristippe, of lykely, iudge not true. Aristippe a Philosopher that flattered Alexander. Who trauayling in Lybie coste his golde did caste away, Bycause it did from iorneyinge, his men a litle stay. Which is the madder of the twaine? but we ne can, ne will Sample, againste example bringe, to samples that be ill. If that a man bye instruments, and horde them in a place, Him selfe not weyinge of the sounde, nor forcinge musikes grace: If that a man shoulde bye him stuffe and tooles to sett vp shop: Or bye hym sayles to hange in ship to hale her by the top: And neuer meane to practise oughte, is he not starynge mad? Why is not this our couetouse as much in frensye clad? Who hoordes his money, and his gould, and vnneth dare auouche it, Because it is so preciose, to peepe at it, or touche it. If that a man an hudge heape greate of corne shoulde euer keepe, With stretched arme, and club in hande, for feare berefte of sleepe, And bringe owner durste not take, one graine, (misdreadyng waste), Eatinge most bitter rootes, and leaues, vnmilde vnto the taste: If one haue manie vessels full, a thousande tun of wyne, And drincke nothing but vinaiger, vntastie, and vnfyne: Goe to, if one of fyue score yeares do lye on couche of grounde, And haue his downe, and fetherbeddes, (where he mighte sleepe full sounde) Stufte vp in chestes, for wormes and mothes: sum will not houlde them mad, Because the moste of wealthie men, be now as vyle, and bad. O hatefull head, forlorne to God, spares thou for tyme to cum? Na, na, thou spares that thy lewde childe may spende the totall sum. Eche day will spende sum portion, (thou thinckes) if thou do spende Oyle to annointe, oyle for thy borde, amongste thy meates to blende. Further, thou sayste, it is the beste, to lyue vppon a smal. Why doste thou then forsweare thy selfe, Testie anger a kynde of madnes.and filtche in places all? Haste thou the wittes, that beates thy men, because nothinge can please the? Which thou with purse, haste purcheste deare, to ayde the and to ease the. When thou doste poyson thy parentes, and strangle vp thy wyfe, Arte thou not mad, though in Arge towne, thou droue not out her lyfe, Nor yet with sworde as Oreste did, A man is mad at the first c?ceyt of mischiefe.or do not it inacte? Yes yf for hope of gaine thou hast, but thoughte vppon thy facte, Was he not mad before his blade had brusde his mothers baine? Or forthwith, as this cruell fitte, Was crepte into his braine? Sence that Orestes hath bene clepte giddie, and madde by name After the cryme, he hath not done a facte of haynouse blame, His syster deare, nor Pylides, he neuer stroke with sworde, To him, and her sumtimes he gaue a foule vntowarde worde. Her feinde him woorse, as him to speake, his pearsinge choler woulde: But thou in harte kilste all thy frendes, that thou mightes haue their goulde. The penyfather Opimie, Opimie. who had so muche in store Who holyday and workyngday, did toyle whilste he were sore, Was troubled so with lythergie, for sleepe he coulde not stere, His heyre wente rounde aboute the chestes, with blythe and iocaunte cheare: A frendlye quicke Phisition, to make, Opymie starte, Contriude it thus: he bad them bringe, a borde into the place, A sorte eeke to vnseale the bagges, and tell the coyne a pace. He rearde the sickman from his bed, Syr (quod he) houlde it faste Or els no doubte, those will haue all, and sparple all at laste. Opimie. In my life tyme? Phi. awake betime, be lyuely then in deede Opimie. What shall I doe? Ph. fall to thy meate, there is no way but feede. Els, will thy spirits be forfaynte, thy vigour fall away, Thy stomake weake and languishinge, will bringe the to decay. Op. You geue me naughte. Ph drincke vp forth withe this Ptysande made of ryce. Op. What shall I paye? Ph a small Op. how much. Ph. Two pence. Op. alacke, the pryce. Such costes is woorse, then sworde or theefe, cum death I will not ryse. Damasip. Now who is made? Sto. Eche foolish man, what is the couetouse? Dum. A foole and mad. Dam. what if a man be nothinge rauenouse, Eftsones shall he be coumpted sounde? St. no: Dam Stoicke tell me why? Sto. Put case the restlesse paciente full ill at ease shoulde lye, His pulse doth shew, he hath no stitche, nor straininge at his harte: Is that ynough to warraunte hym, forth of his coutche to starte? Sharpe p?ges may twitch him in the raynes, and twitche him in the syde: So, though one be not couetouse, yet may he swell with pryde. They neade no salue, to say a sooth. that vse not for to lye, Nathelesse the testie may take pilles, to purge melancolye. Almost as ill to hoorde thy goodes, that they geue no releefe, As if thou shouldste bestow them on, an arraunte pilferinge theefe. Olde Oppidie two manors kepte Oppidie.of longe in Canuse towne Entailde to him by due discente who sicke, and lyinge downe, On deade bed, then calde for his sonnes, (which were no more but twaine) And thus to speake vnto them both, the parente woulde him paine. Aulus, my sonne, when thou in youth, A pretie note for parents. counters in purse didste beare, And francklie on thy playfeers wouldste, bestow them here and theare, Tyber my sonne when thou thy nuttes wouldste tell and tell againe, By this I gatherd, that in you, two diuers sinnes woulde raine: That Aulus would be ryotouse, that Tyber naught would spende, Wherfore, for gods owne loue deare sonne vnto my lore attende. Aulus, looke thou diminishe not, nor Tyber thou increase, That, which your father thoughte ynoughe to mantayne you in peace. And, that whiche nature lymiteth: Leste, ticklinge glorie may Incense your heartes, take here an othe, before I passe away: That which of you shall sewe in Rome, for roume, or for degree Shall take hym selfe as most deteste, and quyte accurste of me. Alas, Aulus (mine elder childe) to geue the giftes of pryce, To deale amongste the Citizens, that they gainste the may ryse That thou maiste walke in pompe, &amp; porte, Lyke Agrippe. thy statutes stande in brasse, What vayleth that? when all is gone what vayleth that (alas.) Excepte to win a princes fame, Esope his foxe.and plausible estate, Lyke foxe: thou weare a lyons skin to seeme a lyons mate. What though thou warte a prince in deede? Insolence noted in pr?ces in Agamemnons personage. Tucer.in pride thou mighte offende, As Agamemnon, in whose wordes most princes wordes are pende. Syr kynge, why maye not Aiax be enterred in his graue? Agamemn?, I am a kinge, my lusts a lawe, your answer (lo) you haue. Tucer. Moste puissaunt prince, my suite is iuste, if anie can say nay, Without all stop, or ieoperdie, his sentence let him say. God graunte your noble maiestie, to see your natyue soyle. Leege prynce, take pause a space, and then, my pore demaunde assoyle. Agam. Demaunde at once? Tew: shall duke Aiax the nexte to fearse Achill: Who famouse was, by sauing greakes, vntombed tarrye still? That Priame, and his folke may ioy, to see him lacke his graue: By whom their Troiane younkers slayne, no countrie toumbe coulde haue? Agamem. A thousande sheepe he slewe in rage, the famouse Vlixes, Menelaus and me with sworde he thoughte he did disease. Tucer. When thou in Auled for a cowe, didste slay thy louing childe, And salte her heade on alter stone, waste thou then mad or mylde? In what degree did Aiax rage? what did he? slay the sheepe. From lemans bayne, and daughters baine his blade he coulde ykeepe. Perchaunce he curste and bande at large the, and thy brother to: With me, nor Vlixes his foe, he neuer had to doe. Agamemn?. The lingering shippes, that they myght sayle from hauen where they stoode, Of purpose good, I pacifyed the wrothefull goddes with blood. Tucer. With blood of thyne, thou mad kyng, thou, Agam. with mine, but I not mad. Stoicke. Who doth confounde things good and ill (as you) is euen as bad, To folow shewes, and vttershapes, to gesse but at the good Is follie leude as is the deede, that coms of angrie moode. Aiax he slew the sillie lambes, therfore, distraughte of witte: And thou for tytles, and renoume, fell murther doste commit. (Hast thou thy wittes?) or arte thou good, all swelled vp with pryde? If in a coche, a fyne fleesde lambe, a kynge shoulde cause to ryde, And geue it rayments neate, and gay, and geue it maydes and goulde, And call it pugges and pretye peate, and make as though he woulde, In woorthy wedlocke it bestowe: the Pretor woulde fordoe it, And make his frendes looke to his witte, for feare he shoulde forgoe it: What if a kynge for a doumbe sheepe, his daughter sacrifice, I wene the kyng will graunte himselfe. not to be verye wyse.

The fourth satire. [of Horace] The Poete commoneth with the Epicure Catius, who reueleth vnto hym a great companie of scholetrickes of that secte.

To furnyshe well a feast, is harde, a thynge not learnde in haste: He that woulde doo it gorgious, must haue a practisde taste.

If thou wilte purge Mounteflascon wynes, and make them pure and cleare, Set them abrode in open ayre, when many starres appeare.

Poet.Syr Catius, for Goddes dere loue and myne, my prayer is, An other tyme, to leade me where I maye heare more of this. Though well I wote, you coulde for skille, haue played the maisters parte, Yet nothing lyke the Epicure, the father of the arte Besides, his graue and modeste lookes, and reuerent attyre, Would make one heare him much the more, with zeale, and great desyre. Whome you perchance esteme the lesse, because you hapie still Enioye his sight: but I do wish to go vnto my fil, The christall fountaines hard to finde, and there from vertues rife, To take an practise perfect rules, of pure and blessed life. The fifthe Satire [of Horace] Vlisses At His Home Comming being brought to great extremitie and miserie asketh the counsaile of Tyretias, a prophete in hell. hovve he may be ritche againe. In Vlisses consider the state of pouertie, in Tyretas talke, the vngodlye counsaile, of the deuil, and the priuie suggestions of the worlde, and her practises. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Tyre read Tyretias For Vlix read Vlisses Vlisses. Tyretia at my request, tell me a little more, How may I be, so ritche a man as I was once before? By what meanes, or what pollicie? (Prophete) why dost thou smyle? Tiretias O suttel pate, art thou not well, from shipwracke, and exile To haue escapd, thy houshold goddes and Ithacke iles to see? Vlisses. O Prophet soothfaste in thy speche, (alas) but seest thou me, How bare and beggerly I cum, into my natiue lande? (Thou hauing so foretould my fate) nothing in plight doth stand: The woers spend vp all my goodes, and howses do defyle. Tyresias My stocke, and vertue without gooddes, are thought as thinges most vyle. To cut of talke, since pouertie thou dost abhorre in hart, Now harken how from deepe distresse, a wittye man may starte.

When that our sobre companie begins to warme with drinke, Of purchasing, or supplantinge we do not eftsones thinke: In trothe, our talke it multiplyes, but not of baude, or queane, Or who doth friske it best in daunce, no it is chast, and cleane. Of knowledge, most behoueable, as if in riches be, Or in vertue, the chefest good, (I clepde felicitye.) If frendshipp spring of vse, or gaine, or do to vertue tende What is the good calde soueraigne, what is her verye ende. If any praysinge hurtefull goodes, of ignoraunce do fayle, Our neyghbour Seruie, hearing that, steppes in to tell his tale: Full gosseplike, the father sage, beginnes his fable then. The countrye mouse, did enterteyne, within her homelye den The citie mouse, the olde hostesse, Fable toulde. her olde acquainted frende Doth welcum, loth to sparple muche: and yet for to vnbynde The corsey anguishe of her geste with syghtes of daintie fare: Not hurded pulse, nor longe stalkd otes, (the prodigal) doth spare. She serues in mouth the curnell drye, the gobbets chewde of larde, To please her geste, with cheefeste meates, was cheeflie her regarde: (Her geste that tasted on eche thinge with toth of muche disdaine) The rurall mouse eate new thrushde chaffe, and put her selfe to paine: Reseruing wheate, and cockle flower, (two dishes of muche ioy) Unto the fyne fed citizen, a straunger all to coy. At lenghthe bespeakes the cytie mouse: my frende why lyke you still, To lyue in countrye fastynglye, vpon a craggie hill? How say you? can you fynde in hearte to haunte, and set more by The citie, then the saluage woodes? marche on, be boulde to trye. Our earthelie soule is ruinouse, not possible to flye From dinte of death, by any meanes, the longeste liude muste dye. Wherfore good sister, whilste thou maiste, do bayth they selfe in blisse, Remember aye, how shadowye, and shorte this lyfe time is. These sayinges moued the rusticall, full lightlie leapeth she: They both begin this gay exployte, the citie for to see. Benighted cum they to the towne: (for midnighte then did hyde The midle parte of roumie skie) when both at equall tyde, Did presse their foote in pallace proude: where scarlet vesturs reade, On Iuery beddes did glose with gleames, as it were glowing gleade. Muche was the noble remainder, of gorgiouse supper paste, Whiche was bestowed in baskets shutte, not clasped very faste. Therfore, this straunger (countrie mouse) on purple quishion set, The townishe dame (as nurturde well,) her noble cates doth fette. A feast, of much varietie. she like a seruinge page Dyd dayne to go to bring, to taste, in proper personage. The trauailer, doth lyke her chaunge, and quyte deuoyde of feare, As dedicate to feaste, and wealthe, doth glade her selfe wit cheare. All sodeynly, the clappynge dore, doth fraye them into flore, Affrighted sore, a runde they trip, Dismayed more, and more. Also the vaste, and ample house, of mastie dogges did sounde, The mowse, beset in sorye wyse, doth shape her auswere rounde: Farewell: I nede not suche a lyfe: the harmelesse wood, and caue, Can comforte me, with fatche, and tare, and so my bodye saue. The seuenth Satyre. [of Horace] It is good and profitable for the Maister somtimes to heare, the true, and honest instruction and aduertisement of his seruant. In olde time, seruantes might speake in the moneth of December, whilest Saturnes feastes were solemnised, frankely and at randon. The Poet bringeth in Dauus, detectynge his maisters practises. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Da. read Dauus For S. read Simo Dauus. Ere whyles, I listned to your wordes, and sumthinge woulde haue sayde, But, I a seruaunte, and Dauus, was halfe, and more a frayde. Dauus, a true, and trustie page, so muche as sence will geue. A frende sir, so farre vnto you, as I my selfe may lyue. Simo. Because our auncitours so woulde, the freedom of Decembre Enioy, speake out all things amisse, that thou doste nowe remembre. Some men do stifflye sticke to voyde, and still pursue theyr praye, Dauus, Sum to and fro, now well nowe woorse, and kepe no common stay. Lyke Priscus, chaunging of his ringes, who such attyre hath bought, And chaungde his suites, so ofte a day him selfe hath chaungde to noughte. His house, and lande, to morgage layde, yea, neede doth him compell, In simple cotage to abyde, where scarce a slaue woulde dwell. At Athins, very studente lyke, at Rome, a lustie lad, I maruaile, what vnstable starres what byrthsygnes once he had. Volauerye stickes to one trade, for gowte he can not ryse, And therefore nowe he fees a man, to caste for him the dyse. Suche constaunte folke be better then those chaunglings in and oute, Who plunge in euerye follye, whiche theire heades can bringe aboute. Simo. Wilte thou not say, thou stretche hempe, thou whome thou meanes in thy pratlynge? Dauus. I meane euen the S. How so sir knaue? Da. For, thou wilte still be tatling In praysing state of foraine tymes, but if that thou mightest chuse, And God would place the in those worldes, no doubte, thou shouldste refuse. Or thou in hearte didste neuer thincke, whiche thou in worde hast sayde, Or thou not stoutlye cleauiste to the truth as halfe vnstayde. Scarce fullie yet resolude to plucke thy foote out of the myer. At Rome thou loues to be abrode, abrode, thou doste desyre To cum to Rome, and dost extoll that lyfe aboue the skye If thou beest no mans geste abrode then doste thou magnifye The priuate cheare as though thou wouldste, be bounde to lyue so stille: And thinckes it well, that thou ne goyste to tipple, and to swill. But if sum bid the cum indede, thou lins, not then to crie, Oyle, water, haste my seruants haste, awaye thou doste the hye. Full manye sillie seruiters, that wayte wyth emptie paunche Say to them selues, when will this churle his glutton stomacke staunche? I am a smelfeaste bellyegod, idle, and full of slouthe A gredie gut, and at a worde a seruaunte to my tothe. Since thou art euen as yll, as I, and worse to, in thine harte, How durst thou first beginne with me, as thoughe thou better warte? Thou canst disguise thy sinne with words, thy wickednes vnfould, The satyre alteredThou art more fole then I, which earst, for fyftie grotes was sould Explaine thy browes, restraine thy handes alay thine anger fell, What Cryspins porter toulde of the I wil make bould to tel. (Quod he) Dauus, that sillye foole, hath not his masters cast, His harte is euer in his tongue, for if the fact be past He takes no sounder rest, whilst he. hath chatterd out the thing, Then doth the swine, that hath her groine new wounded with a ringe. In open day, in open stretes, he praunces, and he prates, He makes the younkers al a flote, to breake the brothells gates. His acts are euer euydent, and therfore rife in talke, Because he doth not make pretence, nor vnder coler walke. His master goes in sage attyre: that geues a sober shue, His master solempne in his wordes: that makes him seme so true: Dauus in sight of all the world doth as I sayd before. Simo doth al that pryuilye, much willing to do more Simo is riche and rubbes it out: for goulde hath this by kynde, To louse or tye the tongues of men, and to contente their mynde. Simo maye be a goose, a sheepe, a noddie, and a daw, And haue not giftes, or qualities, to counterpeyse a strawe: Yet Parasytes will tearme him good, and wyse, at all assayes. I wisse, redde goulde can make a daulte, a paragon of praise. Yf Dauus do but talke amisse, a cockescombe, or a bell: Suche badges might beseeme oft tyme the masters very well. The royster weares not alwayplumes, nor yet the deuill a tayle, If euery foole did were a bell, there would be iollye sayle. Simo can laye to vsurie, and yet by plea of sleighte, He will persuade the thinge to be a sinne of little weighte. So drunckennesse, is belowship, furye, is manhood foulde, Fondnesse is francknesse, and scarcehead, for thriftynesse, is houlde. In fyne, no cryme, no vyce, no sinne in Simo, muste vs knowne: No faulte in Dauus but forthwith with trumpet it is blowne. Yea, Simo can cloke leacherie, or clepe it, by suche name That now it seemes, a neyghborhood, a thinge of little blame. Simo, He slaundered me, (Dauus my man, I am no leacher, I.) Dauus Nor I a theefe, though, I woulde steale, and yet for feare passe by A peece of plate, but this I say, take punishement awaye: Masters the more disolute for default of correction.Nature woulde breake her bridle straighte vnrulye without staye. Canste thou be calde my gouernoure which arte to vyces thrall, To fansyes, pleasures, wrathe, and teene, sythens, I shun them all? If all the customes of oure courte, woulde franchyse thee in libertie, Thy feare of goodes would make the slaue, and keepe the still in villanie. Also an other argument: if that your customes all, A seruantes man, a substitute, or fellewe seruaunte call, What am I, in respect of you? for thou haste rule on me, A wretche, subiecte to thy luste, as any wretche can be, My master, to a sencelesse blocke thats moued by others mighte, Pufte vp with pleasures plungie puffe, may be resembled ryghte. Simo Who then is free? Da. The wise that can his owne affections stay, Whom neyther neede, nor death, nor grefe of massye gyues can fraye. Who can be lorde vpon his lustes, and hawghtie roumes dispise. Stronge and sufficient in him selfe, in full and perfitte wyse. Nor passe vpon externall thinges, commoditye, or gaine: On whom fortune, his heuie frend doth make assault in vaine. Canst, thou not note, by these fewe things who may be coumpted free? Admit, an harlotte pickde thy purse, and much abused the. And calls the to her house againe from yoke, and seruile snare, If thou best free, ridde then thy selfe, thou canst not quenche thy care: In deede, a tyrant forceth the, and broddes the forward still, Doth twine thy chappes, &amp; pricke the forthe full sore against thy will Appityde a tyrant. When, thou dost gase on womans shape, by Pausies hand portrayde And I of other painters workes Pausie a copayoter my stedfast lookes haue laide? (To marke the rankes, the warlike troups in letter lymmed plaine: And how thy stryke and how thy ward, and how they take their bayne:) Thou altogether womannishe her portrature dost view Sinne is seruevving effeminate pictures Who sinneth more, or thou, or I? speake soothe, and say me trew. Dauus, is counted slacke, and slow, if he do them suruey: Simo doth loue antiquities, and iudgeth well they say. They count me naught, if that I doe but make a little chere: It is a vertue thought in the to banket all the yere Why is the pampring of the paunche, so hurtful vnto me? Because, my backe dothe beare the blowes, if ought displeaseth the. How dost not thou deserue the whip that costlie cates doth bye, And eates, and drinkes, and reuells still Without all modestie? One commoditie of gluttonie.Dainties becum no dainty thinges, where there is naught but cheare Thy stackering stumpes, thy corsye corps at lengthe wil hardly beare: The seruant, if he steale but grapes, is streight attachde of felonie: My maister sells his landes for meate, doth he not sinne in gluttonie? A gaine thou art not with thy selfe, thou neuer art at leasure, Thou canst not rest, nor take a pause, nor muse at thinges of pleasure. Thou shunst, to reason with thy soule, her counsaile thou dost hate, Per consequens, thou shunnes thy selfe A very harde thing to heare our faultes vvithout coller,(ful like a runnagate) Thou thinkes by slepe, and bibbing wine to banish out all woe Dauus Thy conscience wil worke the teene whersoeuer thou dost goe Simo Ah sirre, wher mighte I get a stafe? Dauus wherfore? Simo: or els a stone? My maister maddes, or maketh rymes, he museth so alone. Simo: Except thou wilt be trudginge hence, and make no more delaies, Thou shalt goe to my manoure place, to worke thes nine long dayes. The eighte satire [of Horace] Againste the Epicures vsages, that to kepe a riotous rout of seruinge men, is no treue hospitalitie. Against excesse in bely chere. Horace talketh vvith Fundanus Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Fund. read Fundanus Horace: Howe doo you like the Epicures repaste, so riche, and gay? This other day I sent for you, and then I did heare say, You dynd abrode. Fund. In faith my frend it liked me so much, That ere this time, I do beleue, there neuer was one suche. Horace: If that it be not tedious, nor do not you displease, What meate was first, your angrye maw that gan for to appease? Fundanus Fyrst had we brawne from Lucanie, the father of the feast, Saide, he was slaine when southerne wind his blustering blastes releast. Rapes, Radishe, Lettice, Sherwicke rotes, brothe start in tast, and quicke Came next to make our stomake slow more vrgently to pricke. Fayre tr?chers then was cald for straight, the purple carpet drest, Eche man desyres to syte next him, that tauntingly can iest: Rybauldes, and cockescombes are in deed a sauce vnto our feast. Fooles haue with vs a priuiledge to tel who, what, and when, Fooles speake oft times, the very thoughts of wise and wittie men. Ther was the costly Cullices the Turbut and the Pyke, The Porpose and the Porpentine with many such the like. Pyge, partrige, peacocke, sparrowe, qwale, so many of a rowe, That scarce the eater leaueth rome, to fetche his wind, or blow. All thinges, so formally brought in, so solemnely assaide, As though on alters to the Gods the banket had bene made. What drinke you maisters (quod our hoste) Gascoyne or Rennishe wine. We haue of al sortes in this house, both lately brochde and fyne. Then when that wine had wonne the fielde, and maisterd al our guesse, Lord what it was a ioy to see, how some it downe doth presse: Like as the thing that heauye is, of Nature so is made, (Except the same by violence forholden be and staid, To fal to grounde: like as the oke, of substance styfe and stoute Cums downe, when he with dynting axe is hewed round aboute: So doo our hoglings sinke foorthwith, (their heade a Baccus barge) Wine is I tel you, burtheynous, and passing ful of charge. Some singes of loue and louers fittes, and, how Cupidos dart Did smite him (gentil soule) amysse, so deautyful an harte. Some mourne and blame their sorie fate, The diuers sortes of drunkerdes why Fortune shoulde be suche, That they suche blouddes shoulde nothinge haue, and others ouermuche. Sume chyde, some chatte, some raue, some reele, and some can take the payne, Of curtesye to geue myne hoste, his supper vp againe. Some will vnfould bygge mysteries, and fram his matter so, As though he had aboue the reste, gotte Phebus by the toe. Some wyll lament the state of tymes, and howe that all is nought. Howe thinges be rysen in theyr price, and howe they haue ben bought. Some sweare that they haue lyued yll, and howe to morowe daye, They wyll accorde with all the worlde, and gynne on other playe. How Vertue is a perelesse dame, howe fewe do her imbrace: This will they preache in gestryng wyse as though in publike place The thing were done. (lo Horace, lo) our suppers and our cheare: We spare no coste, we may not aske if it be ceape, or deare We keepe a troupe of seruynge men: a crewe of lusty brutes, And these for our great honours sake, muste cutte it in their sutes. These be our handye instrumentes, to worchen all our will, Not scrupulous for to inquire, if it be good or ill. So many, so officious, that not one heare may lye Amisse on vs, but he or he, will spye it by and by. We laugh at those when they are drunke, those make a sporte alone: To scoffe at straungers, when as they with drinke are ouergone. So so, no more Cupide cannot from hyue of honey licke, But one or other bee forthewith will sting hym with her prycke. The world the hyue the combes, the welth, which who so dothe assaye, Pleasure in face, poyson in tayle, Lyke Scorpion they wyll paye, The stynges that pricke be choking cares, These hony tasters haue: Whilst they are toste within th? selues, to seeke, or howe to saue. Wealthe is a thynge moste venomous, and fewe or none we fynde, But pleasure hath lyke Circes cuppes yturnde them from their kynde. Why shoulde the wyse esteme so muche, a rowte of waytyng men? Who, in theyr age most commonly, what are they? beggers then. Brought vp so lewde, contynue lewde, retchelesse, and ydell swaynes: Not knowyng arte, or handycrafte, nor able to take paynes. To kepe them braue, doothe euen as muche thyne honour true vpholde As yf thou shouldste make thee a tayle, and gylde the same with golde Is hospitalitie in those, in feding any such? In keping strong and heddy drinkes, in beluing ouermuch? Like spunges neuer satisfyed, and like Vlixes foes, From meate to bed, from bed to meate, and so their circle goes. Deuisers of all wantonnesse, what shoulde I tell you more? Good to increase, and multiplye their lorde or maisters skore. I do suppose, that if mens wealthes, should answere to theyr wylles, That night and day wold scarse suffice to reuel out their fylles. Eche man is counted of most price and meet to be a Lord, As he with dishes can depaint, and ouercharge a borde. No talke how wise, how vertuous, or to take paines how able, But if he kepe great store of drinke, or honorable table. Ther fore some people parasites, that they may seme to passe, Wyll spend out Malueseye, Muscadel, and fumyshe Hypocrasse. And make their cookes so looshiouslye, their delicates to dresse Their very meates so insensiue, brought in, in such excesse: That I do lothe them more in minde as thinges more full of harme, Then it that witche, that Canadie, had cursde them with her charme Horace to his booke Me thinkes my booke thou ginnes to looke, to sayle for to be gone: And now forsouthe to lye out sleakd with printers poomise stone. Thou hates for to be locked vp, with claspe for to be shitte, Though shamfast bokes haue wel estemed and euer likd of it Thou sorye to be shewed to fue communitie dost praise: Not so instructed Booke of me, go flye thy fancyed waies, Thou neuer must returne againe. Ah wretche why did I long? What haue I done? (thus wilt thou say) when sum haue done the wrong. This wel knowes thou, the reader cloyed. wil eftsones at the snatche, And thou by running thus abrode, thine ill report dost hatche. Except that I an Augur false to rid the hence mistake me, Thou shalt be dere to Rome a while, whilst thy good dayes forsake the. Then must thou be an obscure booke for moughtes on the to eate, A goodlie dishe, thou must becum the sluggie mough her meate A passinger through eche hobbes hand, when thou ginst to be vile, Thou must becum to wrap vp spice to trudge abowt a while On pedlers backe, from towne, to towne and I that warnd the stil To lurke with me, shall haue good cause to lawght at the my fill. As he that drew his asse vp th' hill the auckward best drew backe, Angerd at last, he cast him downe to feele his fatal th wacke. The practise knowne, the prouerb knowne and talked on al the day, Who can, or would hould backe the thing, that nedes would be away? And stamering age to petyte laddes in corners al wil reede the, This occupacion bides the to, thou maist haue ioy to speede the, On sum hote day when al thy frinds are reeding the yfeare Deliuer vp this speache to them which I will tell the here. My father but a bondman borne and I at first but poore, I stretchd my wings, and from my nest did mount aloft, and sore, That looke what praise from me for birth: and base kind thou dost take: So much praise pardie more is due to me, for vertues sake. Horace of himselfe. Do tel them that I euer pleasde at home, abrode those men Which bare the cheefest swey in towne and were the lode starres then. Of stature smal, gray headed soone, of sonning very faine, Hastie to wrathe, but so that I was straight way pleasde againe, And let them knowe that I had lyud fowre times eleauen yeres cleare When Lollius and Lepidus were Consuls in theire yere.
