      <field name="fulltext">THE TESTAMENT OF JOHN DAVIDSON DEDICATION To the Peers Temporal Of the United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. PROLOGUE HONEYMOON I waken at dawn and your head On the pillow beside me lies; And I wonder although we were wed Such an infinite fortnight ago, âHave the planets stood still in the skies Since my sweetheart and I were wed, Since first I awoke, and lo, On the pillow beside me her head!â Through our window the wind forspentâ Marauder in garth and wild!â His opulent burden of scent Unloads lest he faint by the way; For the flowers, they were subtly beguiled, And their dewdrops and manifold scent Perfume now the crimsoning day On the wings of the wind forspent. I look, and I look at your face Till my thought of you pierces your sleep, Till your silken lashes unlace, And your blossomlike lids upheave, Till your eyes emerge from the deep As your writhen lashes unlace, And morn and awakening weave The wonder and joy in your face. Then your memory quickens and bids A blush and a happy sigh At the lift of your azure lids, A concord of colour and sound; And there dawns in your violet eye, When you open your flowerlike lids, A thought from the depths profound As an exqusite memory bids. And this is your twentieth year, And your bridegroom is twenty-one; And our thoughts are as fragrant and clear As the lucent splendour of noon. My love is as rich as the sun, And your love is as tender and clear As the lily-light of the moon In the sweetest month of the year. At once when we waken we rise, For the earth is as fresh as our thought, And the heaven-high dome of the skies A miracle constantly new: A marvel diurnally wrought, The earth with its seas and its skies, Its flowers and its matinal dew, Awaits us as soon as we rise. Through the woodland and over the lea That dips to a golden strand, Like fugitives seeking the sea We haste in our morning mood; Together and hand in hand, We hurry to reach the sea Through the purple shade of the wood, And over the spangled lea. In our boat on the swell of the tide We steer for the heart of morn, And I say to you, âSweet and my bride, Should hope be for ever undone, Should destiny leave us forlorn, Thus, thus shall we journey, my bride, Right into the heart of the sun On the morning or evening tide.â Could we harbour with sorrow and care, And friendless, in penury lost, Remain at the beck of despair Like prisoners or impotent folk? Could we chaffer and reckon the cost, And measure out love till despair Subdued us, bereft, to a yoke In harness with sorrow and care? O, not while the morning is crowned, And the evening, with roses and gold; Because like adventurers bound For a kingdom their faith could create In a future of beauty untoldâ Like hazardous mariners bound For the haven and wharf of Fate On a voyage with happiness crowned, In our boat when the day is done, On the lift of the evening tide I should steer for the heart of the sun, And sigh with my ebbing breath, âBe resolute, sweet and my bride; We shall sink with the setting sun, And shelter our love in death Since our beautiful day is done.â But now while our hearts beat high With youth and unfolding delight, And the honeymoon in the sky At her zenith usurps the reign Of the day as well as the nightâ With the honeymoon in the sky We steer for the shore again While our bosoms with hope beat high. Through the tasselled oats and the wheat We march to the skylark's song, Where the roses, pallid and sweet, In delicate pomp parade The precincts the wild bees throngâ Where the winding byways, sweet With scent of the roses wade Through the flowing tide of the wheat. O hark from the meadows! O hear The burden the mower sings! The past, how it hovers near This uttermost isle of the sea! Where the stone on the sickle rings The shadowy past draws near, And the spirit of eld set free Revives in the song we hear. The dawn and the dusk are crowned With chaplets of roses and gold; We two are invincibly bound For a kingdom our faith can create In a present of beauty untold: O love, we are certainly bound For the ultimate haven of Fate On a voyage with happiness crowned! THE TESTAMENT OF JOHN DAVIDSON When suddenly the world was closed to me, And every road against my passage barred, I found a door that opened into space; I built a lodge celestial for myself, An outcast's palace in the Milky Way; I banqueted my body and my soul On light and sound, the substance of the stars, Ethereal tissue of eternity; And took my ease in heaven, the first of men To be and comprehend the Universe:â To know how all things are the infinite Imponderable ether that possessed Illimitable space with tension (pure Spontaneous energy, the pristine state Of matter and its last consummate doom) Before the galaxies with silver seamed The swart oblivion of the Universe, Or pearly nebula began to glow Upon the sable bosom of the night, Or any living nerve electric leapt To elemental ecstasy; and, most Atoning recompense, to feel myself Ethereal fabric, exquisitely spun, Entranced and wreathed of light and sound, the warp And woof of matter; flesh and blood, a lyre Of tuneful colours; every nerve, a strain Of spheral music; body, mind and soul, Material intensity evolved From unseen atoms, each a reservoir And ponderable treasury of power; Infinitude condensed and garnered up In ions, to be sifted, blent, sublimed, Transmuted into life of every gradeâ Lightning, the sexes of eternity, Become a group of chosen elements In flower and beast, and capable in man Of knowledge, understanding, rapture, truth. Therefore it shook me when my senses lost The full material power of crystal vision And audience infinite, that could outstare A million suns, and happily engulf, As in a sea of sound, harmonic curves Reverberant through the ether; fathom depths Profound, and subtle darknesses unplumbed By asterism remote or shimmering waif, Comet or meteorite or shooting star; Resolve the discords of imagined spheres; Enharmonize divergent galaxies; In puissant planes arrest and deftly cleave Irradiance everywhere, from candent fire Inwove, of blanched intolerant stars that burn Pellucid flame, unbraiding prismal hues To stud and gem enamelled firmaments, And stain the welkin and the steep of space With shadowy tinctures; grip the tumult high That echoes through the vast unvaulted courts Interminable, where the nebulÃ¦, Evolving constellations, their spindles whirl, And break it into rhythmic chords, as light Asunder bursts in blazoned intervals Against refractive adamant, or drops In jewelled tears before the cloudless sun: So being unwearied of the universe, As of myself and my supernal place, But faint with glory by my soul conceived, And by my soul begotten, in the rapt Cohabitation with eternity, I left my palace in the Milky Way, My outlook in the skies, and sought the earth; For men must still descend to earth to die. âNone should outlive his power,â I said. âWho kills Himself subdues the conqueror of kings: Exempt from death is he who takes his life: My time has come. The native energy Whereby I exorcised fantastical Immutability, and in my own Resemblance reproduced the plastic world, Beginning to relent, abates the thrust And tension of my thought, discharges love, Unwinds the poignant charm of living, frees Imaginationâknown eternity, Confined in lightning, light, or radiant soul, That breaks atomic chrysalids unseen, Unthinkable, but certain and innateâ To melt into the ether, and to be Transmuted to infinity again. We are the plunging fire, the molten seed That gladdened, swelled and rent the generous wombs We harboured inâmost wilful, fateful births, Predestined by ourselves before the world Or time began, and wholly answerable; For had we not, beyond all yea or nay, Escaped alive among the myriad germs Devoutly squandered from abundant reins To dower a woman's body with delight, We had not been. By my own will alone The ethereal substance, which I am, attained, And now by my own sovereign will, forgoes, Self-consciousness; and thus are men supreme: No other living thing can choose to die. This franchise and this high prerogative I show the world:âMen are the Universe Aware at last, and must not live in fear, Slaves of the seasons, padded, bolstered up, Clystered and drenched and dieted and drugged; Or hateful victims of senility, Toothless and like an infant checked and schooled; Or in the dungeon of a sick room drained By some tabescent horror in their prime; But when the tide of life begins to turn, Before the treason of the ebbing wave Divulges refuse and the barren shore, Upon the very period of the flood, Stand out to sea and bend our weathered sails Against the sunset, valiantly resolved To win the haven of eternal night.â Ten lustres of authentic life compact, And many a visit to the heaven of heavens, Had thus determined me; so forth I sped Upon a mountain-top to die alone. At sunset on the mountain of my choice I stood above the catafalque of day, And watched the quilted vapour harness heaven In chrysolite and ruby of countless hues, Unnamed, unknown, unthought-of, only guessed Upon the moment of vicissitude And pulsing cadence; while the lofty wind's Unseen battalions swung their shining glaives Against me, and across the hills behind, With bridle-bells a-peal and vibrant tread, Went down into the gloaming and the night. Suddenly fear, against me stumbling, struck With heavy foot my heart, that missed a pulse, Then beat upon my ribs as if to break The prison of humanity; my blood, Like snow-dredged water laboured in my veins; My nerves as pithless as peeled rushes now, And now as taut as harp-strings, flagged inert Or hummed with agony; my sight went out; I strained on tiptoe to escape myself Like one hung up that barely touches ground; My arms flung forth, my stiffened fingers spread, Repulsing death, I fell and clutched the earth. Without a weapon or a potent drug, My very will to die had seemed enough To end the consciousness of matter shrined In me a while; and so, indeed, it was; But in the travail of it, fierce revolt Broke out with this intolerable thought Thrust through me by the sunset and the wind, (Deadlier than dying pangs or fabled throes In hell, or anguish actual in dungeons broached By vengeance, lust of souls, or lust of gain)â That being dead we neither see nor hear, And beauty ceases to renew our blood With form and colour, light and harmony. Out of my swoon I wrestled, further roused To live again by high remembrances. Being the first to understand himself, I felt my life the universal will, My death more terrible than deathâin me More terrible than in all the world beside; For when I die the Universe shall cease To know itself. Athwart the tenebrous Oblivion of the starless infinite The lightning eddied into nebulÃ¦, Systems and suns, the earth and life and sex, That I might see the beauty, hear the music, The loveliness which is the infinite; That I might be and know and feel myself Eternity incarnate in the powers Material that eat and drink and love, Beget, imagine, labour, think, invent, The multitudinous atonement knit In brain and blood, in marrow, seed and soul Of all the substance of the Universe. Wherefore I drove my vision through the world As in the turf my fingers dug; I drew The wind's sonorous tune into my ears As whirlpools suck the sea down; drank the air In pregnant sighs and lusty bosomfuls; And felt the mountain underneath me throb. Uplifted by this freshened will I stood Erect again upon the mountain-top, And looked about me, rebeholding earth As though I ne'er had seen it. In the west A range irregular of summits, clear As polished ebony, with giant notch Dinted the crimson shadow of the sun That faded into purple. Utmost heights, Immortal in romance, with forests fledged And battlefields beneath, keen-crested hung In air; then loomed uncharactered as dusk To darkness turned; and sank into the ground When in the wakeful bosom of the night The slumbering landlay hushed. Themonthly star, Whose silver sorcery fills the tidal wave, Ascendant with the sun, in hidden courts Her interlunar festival observed; And through the swarthy battlements no glance Sidereal from any loophole fell. I breathed the darkness, fragrant as a wine Delivered from the lees: it laced my blood With night's material elixir, old And mightier than magic; subtly slaked The PhÅnix-ashes of my thoughts, affined Their diverse elements, and interknit The myriad fibrilled intellects that store The engine and the battery of the brain With power and powers, eternity installed In ganglioned tissue. Long I stood entranced Until a rumour in my quickened ears, A resonance and noise of breathing woke, Of heavy pinions and a griping step Unearthly: faint, afar, and sheathed within The louder wind, but heard, with wonder heard And terror. On the instant I divined Divinity. âMy handsâmy soul is red With blood of gods in battle slain; and now,â I thought, âsome deity, in adamant Accoutred, wheels against me, dragon-drawn From glowing Muspelheim, or charioted By Cyclopean craftmanship, and armed With thunders for celestial vengeance forged.â In my great day and vigour of my prime No god could stand against me; but the mood, That drew me from my palace in the skies To die alone, unmanned meâwas, in truth, The lowering of the flame of life that means Surcease of strength; so that I trembled, I Who hitherto had sought divinity As champions seek co-rivals, faintly hopedâ Abjectly hoped, insidious night would screen My presence! Notwithstanding, when the sounds Heraldic of divine approach increased In menace, through my tremor flashed again My old disdain of spirit and Other World. âThe cowardice of immaterial things!â I muttered. âWhen our days are nearly done; Imagination withered; passion, stale As spilth of blood in shambles; thought, a net Entangling action; and our sense corrupt With soul, the pious title of decay, Then come the treacherous powers to daunt us: gods, That in the flood and torrent of our lives, We left bewildered in their ruined fanes, Or tossed ashore in isles forlorn, or fought And overthrew, if any durst on sea Or land abide our onset, face us then With smooth effrontery, empanoplied In all their specious terrors, sure That scorn can hurt us in our impotence, A supercilious look with anguish pierce Our naked hearts, and lofty silence wring Our flayed and bleeding vanity.â By this The noise uncouth of supernatural flight, Archaic jangle of celestial gear, Rapacious step and breathing arrogant Outstripped the wind's sonorous pilgrimage, Till with the very neigh bourhood of dread, The sheer immediacy of some divine Appellant's onslaught, power enough to brim A year's adventurous life (from energies Material within me disengaged) In ruddier stains dyed deep my labouring heart, Restrung my bones, and reattuned my nerves To quarrel and to cope with the unseen In visionary essences beheld. Forth as a wrestler steps I strode, my hands Advanced palm uppermost, and raked the night With glances keen from bended brows discharged, Hearkening, undaunted now, the braided sounds Phantasmal violently throb and ring In swift crescendo, as the visitant Unknown wheeled up the mountain. Savage eyes Like burning emeralds glared through vapour, streaked With yellow flame from ruddy nostrils flung; And on the instant while I held my breath, Still as the statue of a combatant About to grapple his antagonist, Dragon and chariot and charioteer Swept past me, clearly seen by dulcet light A molten crescent threw, crowning the brows Superb of her who trod the chariot floor With sandalled feet. Umber and gold her locks In loose adornment clustered, crescent-held; Or streamed behind unchapleted. One hand With easy manage curbed the dragon's flight; The other grasped a glittering spear. Her arms, Uncovered, fair and firm as woman's flesh In rounded beauty shone. Her loose simarre, A fabric of the freshest mountain green, Rustled above her bosom, and the wind Wedged it between her thighs and furled it close About her comely leg. She flung a look Upon me as she passed; her lips apart; Her pearly nostrils quivering with her speed; And on her ardent countenance divine Virginity mantling to see me there, While yet her vivid eyes in secret smiled. âShe thinks herself unseen!â I guessed. At once, Belling my hands, after her down the wind I shouted, âHolla, Hecate!â I saw Her swerve and pant like one thrust through that scarce For pain can breathe. âHolla!â again I cried; âDiana, Artemis, Selene! Ghost Or goddess! Deity beheld, halt, halt!â She dropped the bridle-rein; she dropped her spear; She wheeled about and gripped in either hand The chariot's sides, devouring me with eyes That cracked their sockets. Eyebrows arched beneath Alarm engraved upon her forehead; wide Her mouth to drink in wonder at a draught; And every fibre of her godhead tense With uttermost amazement: thus she stood A breathing space, until her eddying hair Blinded her vision. Swiftly then she turned And snatched the bridle, whispering the urgentword That rendered up the dragon to his speed. I, following hard behind, shouldered the wind That like an unseen sighing multitude Oppressed and swarmed upon me. Turf and stone With every step the dragon's talons showered; His furnace breath in rhythmic blasts respired A ruddy gloom that lit his brindled mane; His leathern pinions wide as latin sails On curving yards of Berber pirates bent, With steady motion winged the chariot on, Fluent upon its whirring wheels that droned Like mammoth bees, and from the mountain skimmed A rotatory purchase merely. Far Outpaced I laboured after, hoping still An audience of the goddess of the night; For straight across the dragon's course a stream, Entangled in the mountains, deeply clave A tortuous glen, with precipices ribbed, With rocky caldrons, pools and waterfalls Intestined, fleeced with shaggy woods, and dark With necromantic memories, haunt and hold In faithful ages of unchristened things. âNow, if the goddess deems that there her flight May find an end in arboured secrecy, I, knowing every cavern, nook and vault, Can take her unawares; or if intense Emotion of divinity beheld After millenniums of enfranchisement, Wherewith invisibility endowed Celestial being: if, perturbed, she leaves The way to chance, the briar and the thorn Will soon ensnare her wheels.â But when I changed, On these presumptions, to a measured stride, Suddenly chariot and charioteer, Cresting a knoll that broke the steep descent With upward impulse, climbed against the wind, And, voyaging aloft, from mountain crossed To mountain, lightly borne on mighty vans Revibrant indiscernibly, that wreathed The outstretched dragon in elastic coils Of humming speed. I watched as one who sees A miracle within a miracle. At length the crescent, like a wandering moon In mundane paths astray, twinkled at rest Against a wooded swartness opposite My stance of wonder. Thither thinking naught Of hazard, toil, impediment or woe Allotted all who fling themselves on chance, I sped across the devious ravine; And fording thrice the sluggish brook that seemed With whispered threat to haunt my way unlit And perilous, down heedlessly and up By crumbling verges, where the earth exhaled A spicy redolence of nature's vat, By scaurs of torrent stone, by ivied cliffs, Thickets and mossy brinks and brakes of fern, I reached the virgin deity's retreat, A vaulted hollow in the mountain-side. Within it grew the hawthorn and the ash By briar-roses linkedâwhose blossoms gleamed Like shards of pearly lustre mirroring The dulcet light that shone there; foxgloves piled Their leaning campaniles about the groined Embayment in the mountain; somewhere near The lowly eglantine enriched the night With incense. Overhung by dewy boughs The crystal chariot stood, its shafts of gold Inclined, its jewelled wheels at rest, among The bracken. On a crag the goddess sat, Her molten crescent welling silver fire, While at her feet the unharnessed dragon crouched. âGoddess!â I cried, ascending, âgoddess, hail!â But at my shout her guardian leapt upright. The russet plates and crimsonâpurple, bronze, Emerald, and topaz-huedâthat overlaid His sinuous body like a latticed bark, Glowed in the fury of his onslaught; eyes Illumined with the sombrest blaze of wrath, His mane erect, his sheathless talons curved, His folded wings clanking against his houghs, He hurled himself upon me snorting flame. My very heart grew pale; my marrow froze; I rolled my helpless eyes this way and that, Expecting death; but in the chariot, lo The spear celestial! Shrill the dragon neighed, About to overwhelm me; but I stooped, And underthwart his overhanging bulk Escaped and seized the weapon, crying out In triumph inarticulate. âPut down My spear,â the goddess said, divinity Affronted deepening her voluptuous tones To such a menace, I had almost cast My life away with that, her proper arm; But while her absolute command still rang In my enchanted ear, the dragon, balked And desperate now, a fresh defiance breathed. Surging against me with his scalloped vans Outspread and thundrous, whirlwind-like he whipped Me up, enshrouding me, and o'er my head Gnashing his teeth, tossed high his wrinkled snout In act to grind my skull betwixt his jaws. No room had I, so closely held, to strike; But upward through his furrowed brisket, rough With stumps of wiry hair, I dug and wrought, Begetting death devoutly as a groom Begets a son, until his wings relaxed, Affording ample liberty to drive The weapon homeâand through and out Among his upper ribs, an ell beyond the chine! He straddled blindly, shrieking like a horse Whose stable burns; flounced hither, thither; tore His dripping breast and broke the shaft across, Wheeled round and, whining hideously, fell dead. The gorgeous colours of his plated hide Burned out and left his carcase dull and grey As some forgotten lichen-covered log. His dragon's blood with bitter fragrance laced The mountain air, and like a smouldering fire Crept, scorching turf and fern. The battle won, I leaned against the chariot and addressed The goddess, faint, but resolute to dare Another hazard:ââWanderer of the night, I am the foe of all the gods. I slew Apollo, Thor, Aidoneus. Behold Your dragon dead! Wherewith shall you and I Contend?â I spoke thus, high and hard, aware That deities are daunted, even as men, By arrogance unlooked for and abrupt. And truly for a space the goddess, still Enthroned upon the moss-grown crag, like one Whose purpose and whose speech are both forestalled, Lowered at me with a baffled look of hate. Anon, turning her gaze upon her dead Attendant fixedly, she left her seat, Beside the body knelt, and stroked awhile The heavy mane, inert and withered now. She sighed, she looked to heaven, she looked to earth, She searched the horny leaden reptile eyes, She listened close for any sounds of life, With such sad gesture, such abandonment Of deity forlorn, and so divine A tenderness that I forbore to look. At last she cast my way a wounded frown, And whispered in a hueless voice of woe, âWhy did you kill him?â âHad it been in doubt,â I answered, drawing near, âI should have known You now a goddess.â âWherefore now?â she asked, And stood, confronting me. I said, âBecause Idea of calamity to them Or theirs the gods conceive not.â Loftily She asked, âWhat can you know of gods?â âAll men, I answered, âKnow the God who made the world; Then killed His Son in ecstasy of grief (A wanton slaughter that destroyed Himself) When He beheld the pleasure of His hands, That seemed so lovely in the making, turn To rapine, murder, madness, death and hell.â Swiftly she said, and wistfully and wan, âYou did not like that god?â and on me showered The chastened lustre of her mournful eyes, That with her crescent, languid from dismay, A dusky local twilight interwove. âNor any god,â I said. Then softly she, And with the naÃ¯vetÃ© of divinity, âNor goddess?â And I answered, feigning scorn, âNor goddess.â But she heeded not, and knelt Again beside her dead protector. âWhy,â With duller anguish than before she wailed, âWhy did you kill him?â âIn my own defence,â I answered. âLike a child you prate, as gods Are wont to do. On me unarmed you loosed Your champion: I encountered him, and won. Would you have had me die without a blow?â âYou should be dead!â she said, and rose in wrath, The steel-blue lightning blazing in her eyes, While ruddy fire her crescent overbrimmed. âYou had beheld me: all who see me die; And you shall die!â âIf looks could kill,â I said, âI should be now a cinder at your feet; But I am stronger than the strongest gods.â âYou! Stronger than the gods! What are you, then?â She asked, her mouth so near me that her voice Embalmed the breath I spoke with. âI am he That was to come,â I said. âBut are you god?â She cried, her eyes clashing on mine like flints. âNot god,â I told her; âman; but such a man As was not in the world before my time, And cannot be again.â âOne man is like Another,â she replied. âThe world is full Of men! This was the only dragon left: Not all your nation could atone for him!â I said, âBethink you: there are men and men. How many men have had the power to see Your virgin deity?â âBut four,â she said: âEndymion, Acteon, Orion, you. Know you the fate of those whose second-sight Divined me in the forest or on the hill?â âI know it well,â I said. âDo you, indeed! Then let us hear what mortals say of that,â She cried with withering malice. âOrion, now: What is the tale of him?â âHe, having heard How the sweet goddess of the liberal womb Had honoured and delighted chosen men, Determined on a hardier enterprise, Seduction of a willing deity Being for him not perilous enough. Wherefore he swore a Stygian oath to see, To capture and to ravish you, the chaste Divinity whom not a god dared touch. His savage lust it was that couched his eyes, And showed you naked in your secret bower About to don your hunting-habit. Fierce As that ensanguined boar of Calydon (By you unslipped in wild Ãtolia) Upon your hallowed privacy he crashed The thicket thorough, seeing, to be seen, And at the sight of you at once to die; For in the bosom of his wicked hope Your glittering instantaneous arrow sang Infallible as light. So ended he, The mighty hunter whose renown adorns In stellar script the figured vault of heaven.â She scowled upon my version; but she said, âAnd of Acteon, then, what tale is told?â âA wanton boy, he hunted you with dogs, And tracked you to your bath. Your silver bow Beyond your reach, the magic of your glance Undid his nature; and his mongrels tore Him down and killed him for a rascal stag. Endymion's fateââ âYou must not speak of him!â But I replied, âEndymion and I Pursued you not; but by your own design, Or by an incommunicable power, Descried you.â âHush!â she said, as though I had profaned her person, such rebuke Was in her voice, such distance in her eyes, Such reverence in her motion, such an awe Upon her face. I understood, and said, With equal inspiration, âYou may know How great I am by this,âthat I shall tell Endymion's story swiftly, truly, yet Religiously, and with such warrant high, That you will think your recollection speaks. You loved him, goddess, with a woman's love, Him only, in your monthly glory, him In all your shining centuries, in all Your sweet millenniums of virginity. One night on Latmos, as he watched his sheep, He sang a wistful ditty to the moon Fragrant with budded passion and the rich Account of opening manhood. In your heart That cherished silverly, as maidens should, A delicate, discarnate thought of him, The golden message of his sonnet flowered In roses red as blood; and, ere you knew, Your deity, enraptured, had put on The beauty visible that maddens men. A moment in his sight your loveliness Appeared, a woman's naked godhood, stained With blushes of desire, and faded not, But in his fancy grew. Olympus saw You instantly; and Jove before your haste Had comment of your voice, knowing your plea, Accorded it. He shall not die, Jove said. Had he beheld you by an impious will, Reprieve had been impossible. That once Unwonted ecstasy should overpower My virgin daughter pleases fate and me. Therefore the gift bestowed on him unsought, A vision of impassioned deity, Shall be Endymion's abiding joy: He in eternal slumber shall retain Eternal youth, and in his countenance Eternally the rapture of his dream. You laid him in a cave, and every night, Untouched, unkissed, with maiden vehemence Adored him even to lunacy, your whole Divine existence, spirit, sex entranced In his entrancement; and your daily thoughts As through the Carian woods you still outstripped The swiftest nymph that followed in the chase, Were with Endymion always, poignantly Transported by the sweet subtlety of Jove's Decree, that made you the beatified Beholder nightly, and rememberer By day, of happiness your image gave The dreamerâyou, the virgin heroine Of that eternal miracle of love.â âAlas!â she said, and sank upon the ground, âThe miracle was not eternal. Him, EndymionâO, my caverned treasure!âhim I have not seen; of him I have not dared To think with intimate remembrances For many and many an empty century.â Faint as a glowworm now, her crescent showed A wan and fitful lustre; sighs profound So shook and rent her bosom that she seemed About to fade and crumble in my sight. Although the ruthless foe of all the gods, The instinct of the flesh, an ominous thought, Eluding thought, constrained me, and I vowed She should not perish thus. Two crystal ewers, A golden platter and an agate cup Adjusted in a frame (by Vulcan's craft Of old equipped, the chariot no device For ease of travel lacked) had stirred a vague Conjecture when I saw them; now I knew The goddess's Olympian larder, choice And frugal. In the golden dish from one Pellucid pitcher filleted with gems, Turquoise and ruby, jasper, opal, pearl, I shook a portion of ambrosia sliced In manchets of a mouthful daintily; And from the other, that bore about its neck A wreath of emerald, ruddy tourmaline, Topaz and amethyst, I brimmed the cup With nectar: and the pitchers both appeared After the service replenished as at first. I pondered on the marvel; but a sigh, As of the wind among Ãolian strings Deep shuddering through the night, upon my knees Beside the goddess brought me speedily. She ate and drank, and with the sacrament Of food, the universal pledge of life And health, her virgin deity regained The power, the passion, the celestial looks That filled the picture of Endymion's dream; And in the mountain-vault her crescent made A golden day the darkness thronged upon. Then, âTaste,â she said, âthe nurture of the gods,â And handed me the platter and the cup, Having appeased her appetite, repaired Her vigour, and assuaged her grief with less Than half my offering, so restorative To every faculty of sense and soul Was that ethereal fare. No words can tell The relish of ambrosia, represent Aroma, unimagined out of heaven Until I drank the nectar lips divine Had tasted. Such a supper never man Before me palated, and none again Shall eat in time or in eternity. My high material nature hitherto Had vanquished all divinity that dared Encounter it; but now, to this innate Supremacy no spirit could withstand, The food and wine of Other World conjoined Whatever in their supernatural breed Advantaged gods against me. By the hand I took my chance companion of the night, And from that battle-place with dragon's blood Perfumed and smouldering sward, we passed beneath A lowly architrave of banded boughs. Thence, winding by a path where briars caught Her green simarre, we gained a bosked abode Of solitude sequestered from the wind, That hummed a tune without, and rounded off The tingling silence there from all the world: An arbour to possess a goddess in, With roses hung, and sweet with eglantine, That sweetens all that mountain's tawny flank. The deep intolerant sexual rancour stored In men (who innocently undertake The death of women in the name of love, And ruin beauty that beauty may endure From age to age) augmented, whetted, fired By paradisean refreshment (life Itself in melting mouthfuls, and its gold In potable elixir of the gods) Incensed me with malignant joy to think That I should here deflower the undeflowered Immortal blossom of virginity, Chasten the chastity of heaven with love, Invade the roseal bower of deity, The very maidenhead of maidenhead. But she, foreboding doom, withdrew her hand And set a space between. âWhat den is this?â She asked, dismay and doubt in voice and eyeâ âI thought you led me to a temple near, Some sanctuary, some porch, some ruined fane. This hidden lodge and magic nook, of old Inhabited by nameless gods, uncouth Progenitors of deities whose rites Infect it still with horror, daunts my soul, Celestial though it be. Conduct me hence, Unhappy mortal, ere primeval fate Betray us utterly, and ancient woe Entangle both in undivine despair.â âThe latest tenants of this secret shadeâ They fill it now!ââI said, âare dreams of mine. My place of inspiration in my youth, My refuge, study, haunt and hermitage, The ground is hallowed, goddess: here can come No horror; only beauty and delight Inhabit mansions youth has sanctified.â âAnathema!â she cried. âThe enemy! This was foretold me: I remember now.â âWhat was foretold? The prophet? Who was he!â âProteus announced it centuries agoâ So many empty centuries ago!â She panted, paused and paled, her godhead all Aghast, as in her sapphire eyes arose Terrific memories from the depth of time. âO, in the idle sweetness of the years,â She caught her breath and cried, âthe endless yearsâ A myriad summers, for I followed still The scent of rosesâfate, predicted, passed Me by it seemed: I never gave it thought; Or if it lingered with the pageantry Roaming the background of my tranquil mind, 'Twas merged in legend and Olympian lore My mother (most belov'd delight of him Whose lust immortalised mortality) Leto, sweet breeder of the sun and moon, Hushed me to sleep with when the world was young In golden Delos by the Ionian sea.â âWhat dead prediction, buried in your heart, Revives with such an import ominous?â âNot you!â she cried; ânot you!â in violent wrath: âYou are not he the prophet warned me of! Some lycanthrope in borrowed manhood, some Detestable fanatic or nympholept, Or parasite of fame like him that burnt My temple beautiful in Ephesus; For I remember your insensate brag That fell at first unheeded on my ears. Repeat it now:âyou killed them! Come: you killed Apollo, Thor, Aidoneus! Swear it!âYou, That dared not face a dragon without my spear, Contend with gods!â And like the bridle bells, Imagined of an elfin cavalcade, Her laughter filled the night with ringing scorn. âI overthrew those threeâApollo, Thor, Aidoneus.â Temperately I spoke, inured To all misprision, both of gods and men. Her sudden anger passed, for in her heart The teeth of fear had met. âHow can one do A thing insuperable?â she asked. âNo man Could overcome Apollo at any time; And know you not my brother vanished, long Before renown went west or north of Rome?â âI overcame him; but Aidoneus first; Then Thor,â I said. âAidoneus? Never! He,â She told me, âended when Apollo did. But had that sullen monarch's rule endured, Even you with all your boasted second-sight Could not have seen, still less encountered, him, The wearer of the helm invisible.â I said, speaking like fate, âThere is no term, No brink, no confine to my vision. He Who can espy electrons in their dance Atomic, and delight his burnished gaze In depths of ether, fathomless till now By sight of god or man, was never yet Deceived by artifice archaic. Casque Of darkness, deity impure, obscene And skulking usage neither hid nor helped Your sombre God of Hell when once I tracked Him out. His hateful presence on the earth Was known to me from boyhood by the high Poetic gift I have. Unerringly, When manly years to genius added power, I sought and found him by the Lucrine shore Haunting the entrance to the underworld: Whence far he might not stray for fear of death (That was his minion once) in countless shapes, Unknown when he with Jove and Neptune ruled Their trivial Universe. He saw me come, And laughed his hellish laugh, for centuries A rarity, and that my coming caused The last to wring his fallen countenance. He grasped his helm, upon a willow hung, Whose shade obscured the gloomy port of Hell, And shambled towards me, doubting not to see Terror and headlong flight. But my strong tread, Advancing on him, echoed loud as doom Upon the hollow roof of Tartarus, And daunted him whose office it had been And automatic function, to appal Mankind throughout the ages of his power.â âInsanity!â the goddess cried: âa wild, A sacrilegious lie!â âI saw him quail,â I said; and when she moved to speak again, Continued my recital hardily. âHe stood a moment swithering, then he donned His headpiece, and came at me with dispatch. Had I remembered Vulcan's magic gift, Such power has fantasy, I might have failed To see Aidoneus helmeted; but lust Of battle so obsessed my mind that Hell's Belated champion changed nor shape nor bulk Until my wrath destroyed him utterly; For when he noted in my fervid gaze That I beheld him still, and feared him not Despite the Cyclopean sorcery Of unseen omnipresence subtly forged (That once with Neptune's triple spear and Jove's Compelling thunderbolt ordained the world) Irrational terror inhibited his power, Darkened his vision, and delivered him To my remorseless hands. I gripped his throat And strangled him; I knelt upon his breast And crushed his ribs; I battered helm and head To powder on the stones, and trod and stamped Him down into the dust, and put an end For ever to the nether deity. Forthwith I plucked the brazen gates of Hell From off their adamantine hinges, tossed Them far into the middle sea, and took The facile way, by my heroic deed Become, at last, I thought, a thoroughfareâ Mistaking the consummate consequence, For men both break and make beyond their aim. Yet trembling I went down the Avernine slope, So dreadful was the gloom, the roar and whine So shrill and shattering, penetrant and harsh, The fume of charred humanity so foul, So noisome, and so sulphurous the antique Corruption of the air, time out of mind Unwinnowed, unrenewed; while such a sense Intolerable of age-long agonies Invaded every nerve, that the command, All hope abandon ye who enter here (Sunk in the ocean with the gates of Hell) Inscribed itself upon the stagnant smoke In glittering fire, the image of my doubt. But soon the tide of power within me rose To flood again; and when my sight, attuned To darkness dimly diapered and gilt By withered beams and lustre in decay (The relics and despair of ruined light) Began to search the tract of Hell, it seemed At first as though the place were empty; voice Of woe and carnal smell of burning, all Hypnotic fancy; and the realm itself, So spacious once, a cavern in the earth For antiquaries only; and even they Should have discovered there no vast machines And horrible inventions of a god's Revenge; but spoke-sprung wheels with gizzened hubs, Fruit in a ropy puddle petrified, Dead vultures, splintered stones, and tattered sieves, Lumber of specimens unlisted left To moulder in a cellar underground! I scarce had time to note a bluish scurf, Or phosphorescent mildew here and there, The dregs, the palsied lechery of flame, Licking with fitful tongue the roasted loins Of ancient sinfulness that still could writhe After millenniums of incessant Hell; Scarce to behold beneath the rocky frown And sullen drip of precipices, bleached And bitten, through the marbled ice, Abominable spongy faces peer, When silence came with utter darkness downâ Silence more penetrative, darkness more Essential, vehement, and absolute Than ear or eye the craftiest could gauge. I stood intensely strung expecting death, But sudden miracle befell instead; For, sweet and fresh, the fragrance of the dew, The voice of larks, the wind among the trees, Flowers in the meadow and on the mountains morn, Filling the region with music and delight Established day upon the wreck of Hell. Thus did I kill Aidoneus, thus did I Annihilate perdition that began To fade the moment of its monarch's death, And ceased upon my advent as a dream Disperses with the sound that gave it shape. Hardly was Hell abolished, hardly dawn Had lit his crimson camp-fires in the green Translucent orient, when the forest leaves Inquired in silent terror, every blade Immobile on its rigid stalkâWhich way Against us will destruction come, Storm, thunder, deluge, and the swords of fire? And swift and steep it fell! Like mountains hurled From Utgard, cloud on cloud descended, black, Convolved and dense, with rain aslant, And white as burning steel in driven showers, With funeral darkness for the crest of morn, And hollow on the resonant floor above The rumble of the chariot-wheels of death. Long, golden thongs of lightning leapt and stung; Fork'd brands, and brands like blue-green icicles Hissed hot, and spat and crackled through the air Continual fire in beryl cascades poured; Irregular, convulsive, peal on peal, The thunder rent and shook the firmament; The whole world trembled like a beaten bell. Forth from the storm, gigantic, ruddy, fierce As rage itself, the oldest son of earth Appeared before me, challenge in his eyes, Thor, with his conquering hammer, MiÃ¶lnir armed.â âMy northern cousin,â said the goddess, âceased: When our tradition ended Thrudheim fell.â I made no answer, but continued. âThor, Aware of my inexorable hate, My dire hostility, for gods discern Their enemies without appeal or war Declared, upheaved his hammer, MiÃ¶lnir, high Above his head and brought it down on mine With all the ancient power of Other World. Before his merest gesture giant hosts Had fled without a stroke from many a field; But never had he met a man in fight. His dreaded hammer, MiÃ¶lnir, forged of storm In Elfheim in the furnace of the dwarfs, Did me no harm at all. When he beheld Me standing there unhurt, after a blow So mighty and direct, he clutched his beard And glared, astounded by material strength Invulnerable in men; then heaved once more His magic mace in both hands like a sledge, And thundered blow on blow. I moved aside After a shower of strokes, that struck of old In JÃ¶tunheim might easily have cracked The skulls of all the Thurses there, and down The weapon crashed into the earth, to dig Itself so deep a sepulchre the god Could not withdraw it ere my arms embraced Him like a vice, and pinioned his Against his cloud-girt flanks. All day he strove And panted in my grasp, the while his bulk Enormous, and his sinew, bone and nerve, Of spiritual substance and fibre knit, Dwindled and shrank, and withered to a wraith Illusory, that sighed itself away In tenuous vapour on the evening wind. That was the end of Thor, the mankind god; The mighty worker for the sake of workâ Whose work was never seen and still to do; The bluff, old hero of a hundred fightsâ By ineludible enchantment won, Like every conquest of the Other World. Crushed to a film in my material clasp The god of use-and-wont, of daily toil, The home, the cupboard, tedium, common things, Still flickered in the sky, a wisp of cloud, When from the sunset in Olympian state, Terribly beautiful, Apollo came; For this was my great day.â Divinest scorn Bathing her crescent in a ruddier blush Than that which damascenes with sanguine fire The glowing sickle of the harvest-moon, The goddess silently confronted me, And looked me in the face; but my great night Had dawned. âYour brother, goddessâhe, even he,â I said, âoffered me insult: 'tis a way They have in heaven, and all the heavens: he called Me, Man, with infinite contemptâa name I mean to make the greatest of all time, Of all eternity; and challenged me To sing against him. Who shall judge? I thought, Expecting no rejoinder. I shall judge, Apollo answered. Whereupon I laughed, So godlike was the word. I asked him then, What guerdon shall the victor have? He said The victoryâwhich was great, and manlike even. The penalty, I said, shall be defeat. Ay, said the god, defeat; and after, death In agony: I flay the vanquished: Hell Eternally to follow:âa reply Worthy the hatefullest of all the gods. But if you lose? I asked. I cannot lose, Apollo answered. Think you so! I said. And spoke with high disdain: whichever way The judgment goes 'tis I shall win this bout. Who first shall sing? He struck his lyre and sang. Great was the song, melodious and divine, Preluding darkly in the vast abyss With heavy sounds and words that summoned up Benighted chaos or ever gods and men Or heaven and hell were known, till gathering might, As in the Olympian mystery of things, Reunion and disjunction, heaven and hell With earth between, gods, titans, heroes sprang Impassioned from the all-conceiving gulf Big by relentless fate; then sweet as fire That murmurs in a golden censer lit To blandish adoration, Love began A honeyed ecstasy and soon evolved In gorgeous strains and dazzling cadences, With rich division fledged and winged aloft, A soaring descant like a savoury smoke Of sacrifice that god might offer god. With crashing resonance of brazen strings, As lightning to the thunder of his voice, Apollo uttered next titanic war And Jove's achievement and supremacy. A muted passage followed, dissonant And emphasized with level looks of scorn, Showing the origin of men, from earth Impasted by Prometheus, and the breed, After Deucalion's flood, by miracle Preserved when stones were dowered with life: a race Eternally subservient to the gods, Whom they must worship with profoundest aweâ And chiefly him Apollo, god of light, Of knowledge, justice, purity and truth. He finished in Apolline rapture, playing The spheral music Troy was builded with, Intolerably sweet, and jubilant As trumpets of the dawn, to honour now And magnify the essence of the gods, Consummate jealousy, wherein himself Had no superior; and, that I might lose Courage and hope and fall an easy prey, In this, the swan-song of Musagetes, (Although the prophet knew it not) he poured A fountain of memorial melody To grace the lofty pÃ¦an that extolled His treacherous vengeance on the satyr. Lastââ âBlasphemous mortal!â cried the goddess. âDeath Assail and choke you now! Hell gnaw your bones! Apollo treacherous? Noblest god of all, My brother, most divine and most adored Theophany of justice, light and truth Revealed to men! Marsyas? A Silen, foul, Abominable, bestial, fit for death A thousand times in monstrous agonies!â âHis song surpassed Apollo's.â âIt never did! No voice of heaven or earth could equal his; No flute, no pipe be favourably heard, Whene'er Apollo deigned to touch his lyre.â âThe prepossession of Olympus! Know The truth at last,â I said. âBoth flute and pipe Surpassed Apollo's lyre. Pan overcame (With powerful music of the woods and wilds, Dancing and mirth and wine and harvest-home, The mountains and the pastures and the chase) Apollo's moral ode and heavenly hymn; And Marsyas also with harmonious flute Excelled his minstrelsy. The god performed (A new thing seeming needless in a war Already won!) a famous masterpiece, The most uplifting music wrung from strings, His Trojan overture, when Midas judged Between Apollo and the venturous faun. But Marsyas blew a melody so rich In morn and eve, in midnight and in noon; So stained with spring that blushes in the snow, With summer's diverse bloom and autumn's gold, So passionate and so instinct with love, In single notes like water in a well That drops an orb of music lingeringly, In warbled showers of jewels and streams of sound Like vintage flowing free, more searching-sweet Than twilight when the stars at intervals In shadowy magnificence appear Till darkness like a bridegroom lifts the veil, That Midas, though he laughed aloud to see The eager satyr's crimson cheeks distent To bursting, crowned him victor; and the joy Of every hearer, save the deity Defeated, echoed to the skies. Now, mark The nature of divinityâof yours, As of Apollo's, for you slew, with him, The lovely children fruitful Niobe Amphion bore: a wife whose generous boast Of rich maternity and loyal claim, That he, her spouse, had built a city too, BÅotian Thebes, with music of his lute, Deserved a smile well-pleased from gods and men, Instead of such bereavement as you dealtâ The stolid vengeance of celestial art, The ruthless spite of noisome chastity!â âI was a patroness of motherhood!â She cried in anguish. âAll the gods,â I said, âWere arrogant in virtues, self-assumed To palliate their malice. Let me end This history of divine malevolence.â Between Apollo and his challenger The strife was fair, and true award pronounced Upon the instant issue, the delight The skill and music of the players gave; But your theophany of hallowed truth Adorned the arbiter with ass's ears, And flayed the genial champion alive!â Behaviour wanton as Jehovah's trick, Who set his creatures in a garden fair Beside a beautiful, a tempting fruit, And bade them eat it not on pain of death, Knowing that they would eat it.âNow, no more Till I have finished, goddess of the night.â You interrupted when Apollo sang His treacherous triumph over Marsyas. Last, Rending a shriek from every lyric string, Mournful and heinous as the doom portrayed (The satyr's agony beneath the knife) He smiled with glittering narrowed eyes of hate, And ample expectation of revenge, Immediate, bloody and sufficing even The anger of a god. Silent I gazed On that superb divinity a while, My senses in melodious surges drowned, Such as on Helicon Mnemosyne Had joyed in with her daughters; heard by me Once more, and never to be heard again By any ear throughout eternity. The god's conceit of triumph, unexpressed Delight of mine and still demeanour fed Until it flamed: You yield without a song, He cried, malignant even to happy tears, Whose dew annealed the fury of his glance. Roused from my reverie not a word I spoke, But clasped my hands behind me, having no lyre, And mightily against Apollo's song That pleased Olympus and established Troy, I waged the Universe itself, in being Before Apollo or any god debauched Imagination. Of the ether first I sang, one subtile tension of entire Immaculate energy, omnipotent, Eternal, stretching taut in bourneless space. This infinite elastic etherâpure Dynamic form (no chaos ever was, But order always, mutable and free For every change)âpossessed no sun, no star, No meteorite, no atom, or element, Being a sheer oblivious ecstasy, Until the lightning wakened and began A limitation of eternal space (Which is the ether) in eddying vortices, (The offspring of the ether energised Under continual omnipresent strain) That sought stability in golden drops, Bisexual electrons, pith and seed At once of ponderable matter, each Invisible corpuscle being condensed From myriads of measures of imponderable Elastic stuff, and therefore each a packed Compendium of the Universe, an orb, A reservoir and continent of power Incalculable, manifest-occult Repository of eternity And hidden treasure of the infinite. When these electric gems, confederate all In balanced companies, began to spin Like planets in a system, every group Became a candent atom of hydrogen, First condensation of the infinite. And these again, these atoms, clustered stars Of bezeled lightning, instantly conglobed As passionate molecules, atomic pairs In most material wedlock interfused Insatiably, to throng in countless swarms, Hive upon hive of radiancy insphered And whirling through immensities of space, Till into sumptuous nebulÃ¦ they swelled, The seen, the heard, the ponderable at last From the imponderable, omnipotent, Eternal ether gloriously evolved.â Come to the gods! Apollo cried: the gods! I take them in their turn, I said; and kept The tenour of my song.âThe least of all The nebulÃ¦, contracting as it cooled, Flung off the planets, they their moons, to swing In ample berths miraculously moored By gravitation in a spatial gulf Five thousand millions of our mundane miles Diametrally measured, circumscribed By Neptune's orbit, centred by the sun, Haunted by errant comets that wander out (Obliquely curving through the desolate night That lies between us and the nearest star) And driven directly on towards Hercules In Lyra, planets, comets, and the sun, Though moored, advancing with the speed of thought, And representing in colossal form The balanced clusters of electrons, grouped To constitute infinitesimal Atomic parcels of an element, As solar systems are evolved to be The mighty members of the universe. Secreted by the primal atom, all The other atoms, as the planets cooled, Became; and all the elements, how much So ever differing in appearance, weight, Amount, condition, function, volume (gold From iodine, argon from iron) wrought Of the purest ether, in electrons sprang As lightning from the tension filling space. Forms of the ether, primal hydrogen, Azote and oxygen, unstable shapes, With carbon, most perdurable of all The elements, forthwith were sifted out To be the diverse warp and woof of life, The lowest and the highest, louse and man.â How came the gods to be? Apollo cried, Smiting his lyre in wrath. Their day arrived, I said; but man, whose fault they are, came first. Then sang I other miracles of time: Telluric history, brought to light by power Material in men of resolute Attention, from the dust of ages, shells, And scattered limbs and footprints, petrified In rocky strata, or in fossil mud Matrixed like scripture for the founder's craft; Organic stone, wherein whole species, plant And animal, of their own substance built Their tomb and monument; shale, lava, marl, Obsidian, porphyry, syenite, travertine, Mica and talc, blown sand and drifted sand In deserts and in oceans, fruitful soil With forests, pastures, orchards, harvests fledgedâ Millennial almanac and open scroll Of deluge, fire, volcano, glacial drift, Compacture fierce and winnowing tides of air, That forged and tempered and engraved the earth, Enamelled it with sapphire seas and hung An emerald veil about its nakedness. Then did I sing the greatest miracle, The origin of species, devoutly traced Throughout the scale of being in the deep brain We honour most to-day; and showed the god Assuredlyâas one who can reveal By power poetic what the groper fears To instituteâsex, from the ether strained As lightning, male and female, first and last Delimitation of eternity: Immaculate, discarnate, twifold sex, Electrons, jewel-substance of evolved Ethereal, uncreated Universe, In protoplasm embodied, sarcode stuff Or vegetable, inwoven of the same Quaternion of elements (vapours three, Azote and hydrogen, with oxygen, The great protagonist, and carbon, crowd And chorus, common tissue of the whole) Wherein the ether lightened into life OrganicalâamÅbÃ¦, monera, Bacteria, diatoms, single cells That sped through differentiation, changed Environment and series manifold, By natural selection and sexual, Into the rose, the oak-tree and the vine, And into men and women. And swift again I sang what no one sang before, or said, Or thought:âEternity, which was, and is None other than the ether, infinite Unconscious rapture tensely strung in space, By travail inenarrable and urge Adventurous of evolution shrined Dividual in men and women, to know Itself, to understand the whole and keep The primal, everlasting ecstasy Self-conscious in the passionate kiss of love.â The gods, the gods, the gods! Apollo cried; But shrilly now and fearfully. To them I come, I said; and sang the body of man:â Mucus, the blood unlit; on fire as blood; In flesh, compact and baked like earthenware; In nerve, as pith; as mineral in bone; Fibrous in muscle; and in the viscera, Vegetal; repeating, in the microcosm, Electron, atom, system, universe, With cells and organs, members, moonsand suns.â The gods, the gods, the gods!âI sang the brain, A double sponge soaked in the ether, fruit Hesperian in the garth of space, the goal Unconscious lightning aimed at when it led The onset of eternity towards man: Receiver and recorder, carder, sieve, Alembic, loom and lyre, and every arm, Machine and implement for art, war, use, To put in act the thoughts the body thinks. I sang the multitudinous cells that bud And blossom in the trellised protoplasm Filling the skull, and make the chambers there Arbours of colour, beauty, fragrance, joy, By sulphur's gold and purple blooms uplit, And garlanded with phosphorescent wreaths, Crimson and ivory and violet. And then I sang the gods:âInfinity Confined in atoms, that developed power In many modes, and changed and counterchanged Through force and forces to become in us Terror and hatred, anger, worship, love; And be projected on itself againâ Fantastic, immaterial eclipse Of the actual material universe, The undeciphered fancy, thought, complete Self-consciousness of man flung blindly forth To master mystery and to know the unknown. Vitality?âthe ether in densest stones Asleep, whose thronged electrons, still at ease, In harbours and empyreal roadsteads ride; Awake in protoplasm, a formless stir Or diastase of life, that lends the clot Of carbon-curdled vapours poetic power To gather to itself, and to transmute Diversity of matter into man, The crown of evolution: this it was That men supposed to be another thing Than they, not knowing that the whole Is one material substance. Gods and God Are man's mistake: no brain exists Behind the galaxies, above them or beneath; No thought inhabiteth eternity, No reason, no intelligence at all Till conscious life begins. The ouphs and elves, The satyrs, centaurs, goblins, gnomes and trolls, The ancient lands of faery and romance, Infernal and supernal domiciles, The dreadful dwellers there, and wonderful Cosmogony of Other World (perverse Reflexions of his unenlightened mind Upon the mirror of eternity, And on the mirrors of the sun and moon, The stars, the flowers, the sea, the woods, the wilds) With immaterial nothings deceived mankind, Even as his shadow on a darksome way Looms like a ghost and daunts the pilgrim still.â I am no ghost! Apollo cried: a god, And son of god! But now his voice, a thin And batlike shriek, dismayed himself; his light Had waned, his figure shrunk, before the truth The greatness and the terror of my song, The deep malevolence of Other World Alone remaining. Fierce from his lyre he struck Sundering dissonance that might have ended time; For lo, the gallant-curving horns were warped, The strings awry and beaded thick with rust! Again he smote, so savage was his rage, As with a bestial claw, the tuneless lyre, And straight the instrument of power, that worked By poignant melody enchantment strong As bastioned cities, crumbled into dust. Swift like a famished werwolf at my throat He leapt, or vampire fresh from sepultureâ In semblance only, for the fire was out, His sinew tinder, and his blood a fume. His empty quiver, every arrow spentâ How long ago!âflapped on his shrivelled haunch Like a cast slough: not even the knife he skinned The satyr with was left him. As he sprang His clenched teeth mouldered in his jaws, his eyes, Like gathered leaves that in a kiln curl up, Shrank in their gloomy sockets, and on my flesh His withered fingers hung like gossamer The evening breezes trail; for all you gods Without your weapons or your magic arts, Your heavens and hells and cyclopean bolts, Envenomed arrows, casques invisible, Girdles and shoes of swiftness and gorgon-heads, Are impotent as palsied eld. I struck Him down; dismembered him as one might tear A mannikin in pieces; by breech and neck I seized and kneaded him, and bent and plied And wrung him like a rag until he ceased To be, as in a conjurer's nimble hands A kerchief vanishes. Thus did I meet, Thus did I conquer and annihilate Apollo, Thor, Aidoneus, gods that were.â âThat never were!â the goddess said, and smiledâ Divinity commiserating man's Simplicity. Her grief and horror past, Complacent now and beautiful as heaven's Devoted maiden in the flower of youth And freshness of her nights, fair as herself, She bade me know the truth. âThese were not gods,â And loftily she spoke. âAt first I feared I knew not what. So wide and so profound A gulf divides my solitary time From those olympiads sweet when every brake Blossomed with deity undisciplined, When dryads, hamadryads, oreads, nymphs Haunted the wilderness and watched my sport, That things immemorable had fallen away, Leaving my lonely mind and tranquil thought A thoroughfare of beauty. Chief of all Unblessed remembrance are the loathsome Wanes, Forgotten till you told how in the voice That named itself Apollo shrillness struck And fear with dwindled volume: then I knew A Wane had mocked you. Only voices now, They once had deityâarchaic sprites Adored by uncouth beings, hardly men, That ceased or ever Ouranos began The dynasties of heaven. Unworshipped gods May haughtily retain divine estate, While any scion of the race endures Whose gods they were; but when the blood, That warmed and fostered them with worship, burns Entirely out, they wither into sound, Involving baneful power to personate The very gods themselvesâif time and place Accord, with second-sight like yours at hand To see the phantom. I supposed, indeed, The abhorrences had perished from the world; But those apparent gods you thought you killed Were certainly none other than the Wanes Still at their execrable masquerade.â âAre you of them?â I asked. Her crescent flushed A saffron hue, and from her sparkling eyes Keen lightnings pierced me. Not a word she spoke. âIf the three deities I slew were Wanes, Can I believe that no iniquitous Embodiment of empty sound like them Encounters me to-night?â I asked, assured The slain divinities were what they seemed. âI am the only deity,â she said, âRemaining on the earth.â âSince you remain Might not a remnant of divinity Frequent the day as you frequent the night?â âNo,â pensively she answered. âAll the gods Except my single self departed hence, Whither I know not, centuries ago. Let me recall the past, and let me tellâ What I have never told, since there was none To hear. Can I remember? Can I bear To think it? . . . Silent noon in Arcady: I, in my dragon-car driving at speed, Compelled to wonderment and awe by fate Unknown invading heaven and earthâunknown, But felt: then darkness inexpressible. The gods could see by day and night, but I, Renowned for vision, saw notâheard not: out The darkness blotted every sense save one: Day blazed by contrast when I shut my eyes. Then I remembered Proteus. Once I sought The crafty shepherd of the sea, and bade Him tell my fortune. Gods must come and go; But virgin deity outlasts them all, He said. I thanked him for his prophecy And left his cave well-pleased. He followed, loath, But powerless not, to tell the whole of doom. Until a man shall conquer you, he said, You cannot pass away: which might have been A cryptic promise of eternal life; But in the strangling darknessâNo! So long The horror brooded I believed an end Of all had come: it had, for all but me. The faithful beast you slew, my dragon, stood As motionless as I: I neither heard His labouring heart nor mine, though every throb, Uncounted in that dread obsession, seemed A night of fear. At last a sound arose Far off, a rumbling deep and low that shook The earth as thunder shakes it; travelling on, It filled the air as tempests do; and yet No louder than a murmur, than a sigh, The word went round the world, Great Pan is dead! Soon as the whisper traversed Arcady, The all-devouring darkness rendered up The day again; but not the day that was: Gone were the golden sunbeams; iron skies O'ercanopied the world. Through the dull air I hastened to my hidden place of joy. If I have still Endymion, I thought, An empty heaven, an empty world, for me Are terrorless. His image in my mindâ Eternal youth, and in his countenance Eternal rapture, words of yours or Jove'sâ I reached my Latmian bower and found . . . I found No priceless treasure there: a wind that sighed, A charnel smell, dead leaves where spiders span Their dusty webs; a bat, a toad usurped The mountain-cave Endymion and his dream (Myself in naked deity beheld) Had made the very jewel of the earth. I swore by Styx vengeance more horrible Than any punishment in Tartarus, And lit the air in meteoric flight To high Olympus and the ear of Jove. Alas, no mortal mind can comprehend, No words can tell, no thought can think the change! Where the twelve palaces had soared aloft In massive splendour, beauty and balanced strength, The wonder of the gods themselves, there spread A leprous snow winnowed by icy blasts. I sought no further. What had chanced I knew: The intolerant Jewish God, the terrible Jehovah, subtlest of supernal powers, By magic more inscrutable than his, Had conquered Jove and wiped Olympus out. You know that awful God better than I. The rumour of His mightâ âI know of Him,â I said, eager to speak. âThe sorcery Whereby he seemed to quell the other gods Was twofold. First and foremost, reiterant Assertion of supreme dominion, I Am I; there is no God but Me, assailed The Jewish mind for ages, and destroyed The sense of hearing for the voice of gods Less arrogant. To make Himself renowned Beyond all rivalry, in mythic times Jehovah had proclaimed Himself the world's Creator, never imagining that men Would wrest its secret from the Universe. Howbeit, long before we understood That all things of themselves evolved, His boastâ He had pronounced the whole creation good!â Exposed Him to derision:âgreat, indeed, The world was and will always be, but good It never can become:âand worst of worsts, His chosen race, the Jews, the only folk In all the world that worshipped Him, had passed From slavery into slavery, and were then Writhing beneath the heel of Rome, Jove's might Incarnate. Some unparagoned device Alone could raise a God, discredited So utterly, to eminence again! Nor was that wanting in the operant part Of plausible enchantmentâreinforced With iterance unending of the spell Primeval, I am I; there is no God Beside. When Jove, divinely errant, chose To mingle blood with mortals, heroes or gods Were still the offspring as became a sire Eternal; but this desperate Deity Begat a common man, and in His Son, Not as a natural parent reappears, But really incarnate, lived on earth To change the mood of men and make them His. Now, mark how relative omnipotence And all divine ascriptions are:âWithout Disquietude, and when it pleased him best, Triumphant Jove destroyed Jehovah: left To Rome, Jove's delegate, and by that power Abandoned to the mercy of the mob, (Whose God he was!) His claim was laughed to scorn, And He on Calvary hammered to a cross. That was your time of darkness! What happened then On Calvary when Christ was crucified? The end of Godhead happened once for all: So interwoven an affinity Entangled all the gods; so spiritual A fabric, so essentially allied, Were all your states and towers of Other World, A single death of deity involved The entire extinction of the race divineâ Celestial and infernal; and the ruin Irremediable of every heaven and hell.â âThat was an accident on Calvary, then!â The goddess cried enlightened. âHad Jove known Jehovah would become a man in all Mortality, he never would have risked Destruction in permitting men to work Their will upon his rival. Could he dream That deity would so forget itself! Put on without reprieve the flesh of men? The madness of a god!â âThe irony Exorbitant of chance,â I said: âpursued Throughout the centuries with keenest zest; For only then when all the gods were dead Or moribund, did men begin to pray In earnest, and to worship trulyâboth Jehovah and his conqueror: the one As Christ, the Man of Sorrows; the other, Jove, As God of kings and armies, pride and pompâ In Rome, besides, his ancient seat of power!â âIf deity went out upon the cross How comes it I am here?â The goddess asked, Not now disdainful, but in thoughtful guise, As having met the master of her fate. I said, âThe point of time on Calvary When Christ gave up the ghost; the three dark hours You passed in Arcady, the centuries Of Christendom in which Jehovah, dead, Appeared to triumph, are in eternity One single moment and the same with this In which we meet.â The goddess understood; But asked me of the gods whom I had killedâ âWere they not Wanes, then?â âNo; not Wanes,â I said. âUnless they were the fittest, how they survived No one can tell. I know I killed the three.â âAnd I?â she said. By the great power I have To join the ends of time, and to compress Eternity into a glowing point, One teeming moment of imagination (The active sum of all material force), Nothing in this or in the Other World (Extinguished now), no cause, no accident, No import, no result, no fate (so-called) That ever did betide is hid from me. Giving this faculty the rein, I said, âGoddess and hallowed lamp of stainless youth, Shining supreme in lilied sovereignty Because of maidenhood, you are to-night As beautiful, as fragrant, fresh, and rich In deity and in divine desire, As on the evening when you came of age, And Jove, with such a daughter overjoyed, Enthroned and crowned you, while the dusky stars In envy swooned, or hung about you, too Enchanted with your excellence to dream Of emulation.â Wistfully she said, âBut wherefore then do I survive alone? Athene was a virgin.â âA sexless one; Not from Jove's loins, but from his head she sprang: When the end came she was the first to fade.â âTo fade?â she murmured, while her crescent, filled Anew with pulsing fire, lit up the night. âThey ceased somehow, they vanished, every god, Myself excepted, and the three you slewâ I will believe you slew them: but was that The end of all the kingdoms of the airâ That death on Calvary when Jehovah's treason Undid Himself and us? May there not be Celestial homes beyond the stars, a lodge Above Olympus, a higher heaven than heaven, Where Jove confederate with Jehovah dwells, And Juno visits Aphrodite's bower In sweetest amity? I think there may.â âA goddess's romance! In bourneless space, Fulfilled with matter multiform, no room For any immaterial mite remains.â âNo room,â she cried, âfor immaterial things? But I am immaterial, if you mean, By immaterial, immortal and divine.â I was about to say, âSheer fantasy! You are not; never were!â but in my veins The aphrodisian force of Other World Began a revel as of molten ore, Tumultuous in the entrails of the earth, That shatters mountains and upheaves the sea. Ambrosial food and nectar of the gods, Whereof I had partaken with careless zest, Being savoury morsels of essential life, (I mean the unreal essence of the spirit) And aureate passion, potable, and pure As the first lightnings (though impossible, As the uncharactered inane itself) No filter and no witchcraft ever tuned To such a pitch of poignant ecstasy The senses of her lord, beloved in vain By some unhappy bride, as that which now Inspired me. âGoddess,â I said, âabove the stars I see the dazzling fronts of palaces That overlook eternity. On one A crescent burns and beckons: your demesne, Untenanted and waitingââ âForbear deceit!â She cried: âyou said romance; and now you say, In the same wanton breath, the highest heaven Exists, with room for me!â Against her will To cull the flower of her virginity Had been my purpose: with the loss Of maidenhood her deity I knew Must end at once; and I should then have purged The Universe of the last exile, last Inheritress of Other World. But now Material things or immaterial seemed The selfsame substance, or it mattered not Whether they wereâbetrayal of the truth, And of my own material being, for which I suffered torment dire!âwhile one design Engulfed as in a vortex all my thoughts:â In some vertiginous moment of the blood To win the virgin goddess of the night, And to possess her with her sweetest will. âWhen I derided you, divinity Adorable above all adoration, My thoughts,â I said, âwere wandering far astray In labyrinths where human doubt devours The first-born of the mind. Now I return To earth, to heaven and hell: nor Jove, nor God Did ever speak more truly than I in this I tell you:âNot a gnome or filmy elf, Demon or angel, hero, deity Can ever cease to be: they and their realms Romantic, fairylands, elysiums, bliss And bale, the peopled universe of man's Fantastical creation, as the scope Of vision, trebly harnessed for the strife Against encroaching distances, against Minuteness still dividing, and the war That spectral colours wage upon the stars In conquest of their nature, substance, growth: I say as vision widened, deepened, struck Aloft, extending everywhere, domains Imaginative, and unsearchable By keenest lens or prism resolvent, pass Beyond material ken, advancing swift As thought, or as the constellations speed For ever in a goalless infinite. Above the highest heaven your palace shines With tenderest light. Thither you will ascend When you with me fulfil your destiny; And win high welcome, for the gods await Your certain advent in their new abode.â âI doubt you; I distrust you; all you spokeââ âI thought aloud, affirming crudely things Debatable to clear my turbid mind, Awork with your astounding presence here. The gathered dross, the slag and scoria scummed, I drain a noble metal unalloyed, And cast it in the very mold of fate. Alone and helpless you have none but me: You must believe, and I must speak, the truth.â âHow shall I know the truth?â âYourself,â I said, âBeing divine, are test enough. Reject The thing you doubt without a second thought.â âThen what must I believe?â âDo you believe The gods exist?â I asked. âI neither doubt In my divinest moments that the gods Exist, nor doubt I shall at last attain The lofty home of my celestial folk.â âWhat would you do to bring that time about?â âWhat can I do?â she asked. âWhat have you left Undone? The meaning of your maidenhood, A bandoned here without a token sent From any heavenââ âThe meaning?â âEven this,â That deity, neglected on the earth, Contemned, denied or utterly misknown Since Golgotha and the debacle there Begun, is yet again to be the world's Unquestioned glory in a golden age, Wherewith the times Saturnian shall compare As winter's pallid gleam and drizzling sky With the steep sun of summer and its rose.â âMy long terrestrial exile means a new Beginning of divinity on earth? Tell me of that!â the goddess cried, her eyes, Her crescent luminous with hope: âtellâtell The wonder, the delight, the truth of that!â âIt could not be,â I said; ânor is it high And holy that the everlasting youth, Florescent in the ichor of the gods, Should bloom infertile through millennial years. Unhappy womenâor, it well may be, The happiest!âcan continue maidenhood Till death at last deflowers the scentless weed; For women wither and their summertime Is not so long a war of continence That all must yield. But with the unfading gods Who live in the eternal moment, time Has nought to do; their beauty and their strength Renew themselves: with every ardent pulse Desire augments throughout eternity.â âWhat are you going to say!â âThat all the change In both Worlds was, from Calvary till now, The elaborate accomplishment of fate's Mature device, our casual meeting here.â âIs this a horror or a glorious thing?â The goddess asked the night. âA glorious thing! I from my mansion in the Milky Way Come down to earth to die; you on your beat Nocturnal round the summer world patrol The frontier of the north; and lo, we meet! And we shall mingleââ âNot even with higher God Than God would I unite my deity!â âNo; but with manâwith me, you shall unite! The gods have paired with women and begot BelovÃ«d sons and daughters: dynasties Divine; but unenduring, and beyond Restoral banished. Let a greater race Than any hitherto adored in Heaven, In Asgard or Olympusââ âMy guardian dead! No spear! No arrow! GodâO, any god In any heaven or hell, limbo or land Forgotten, hear and aid me! It is I, Virginity, your flame-clad maidenhood, So highly sphered, so holily beseen, The innocent goddess whom the gods themselves Adored! And, O sweet stars, my bowermaids long Agone, why are you hid to-night? Unveilââ âThe very eyes of heaven are closed,â I said, âThat none may see us!â âI shall see youâI, A goddess!â âBut by you I would be seen! My eyes in your unfathomed orbs deep sunk As in a tide of gloryââ âNever!â she cried. âShall the proud legend of my life, the high Achievement of millennial purity, Immortal flower of maidenhood, be turned To laughter, tarnished and undone, and rent And rifled by a man?âor by a beast? Or by a devil?âvampire, ghost, or ghoul? No fiercest, strongest, subtlest male alive Dare touch me! Go! I bid you go!â âYour wrath Betrays your ill-assurance. In your heart, Installed by Jove when he begot you, love, A dreaming world long time enchanted, wakes In uttermost amazement: passion stirs; The curtains of your mind are drawn, and lightâ Not of the moon that borrows daily fire And nightly freezes itâbut sevenfold light Eternal floods your thought. Clear as the sun, The secret of celestial ruin dawns Upon your wonder; for the sin of heaven That sapped Olympian power, unguessed till now, Was lodged in you, the cult of maidenhood. Virginity is never, will never be, Divine. The worship of an incomplete Existence?âof one half of a being?âSin Unpardonable, and inconceivable As soon as known! But by this very sin, The unhallowed worship of virginity (Achievement of the automatic fates!) You were preserved a maid; and in your sex Myriads of virgin years have so matured Essential deity, so burdened every lode With golden ore of love, and so fulfilled Your beauty with the sorcery of heaven, That he who sees you needs you with a need No mortal can endure. You goddess, you, In unreserved divinity, or death!â She gazed into the darkness; she wrung her hands; Her bosom heaved, her bosom thronged, with sighs. But now her soul had yielded, and I knew That, being a goddess, she would give herself Without another thought than to be mine. âLook, goddess, look!â I said, aware how love Had rolled the years up like a debt discharged, Erased the cross-hatched shadows of old time, And lit my face with youth: truly to love A woman will transfigure any man; But I, desiring deity, became The avatar of deity's desire. She looked, and on the instant stood entranced. Then slowly from her lips her meaning poured Like organ music:ââGreater than the gods, O man, immortal in mortality, For your delight, for your supreme delight I kept my maidenhead. Without a doubtâ I know it in my sex and in my soul!â My womb will teem with daughters fairer far Than their most happy mother, with many sons As great as he whose love, so deified, Will found a mightier dynasty of gods Than any in the records of all the heavens: Justice and guerdon due my chastity Preserved throughout millenniums at a costâ Now I may say it, now that sudden fate Unties my virgin knot!âO, at a cost Incalculable of sleepless centuries And midnight madness that the muffled skies Concealed from gods and men! That pallid dreamâ Endymion in the Latmian cave?âO, that!â Tender, and sweet, and beautiful; a thing To tell aboutâfor slander must be fed In heaven and earth!âmasking forbidden lust That might have horrified the world with births More heinous than ChimÃ¦ra or Minotaur, Had not occasion, still inopportune, Undone the evil thought:âat such a cost The maiden treasure of my deity Was kept for you to plunder! Every pulse Exults and every nerve; my bosom swells Already at the thought of sucklings thereâ My babes upon my breast! But this comes first, The sum and harmony of every joy,â That I shall suffer and that you shall wreak Sweet vengeance for millennial chastity, That my long lonely passion will be shared With one who loves me and is by me belov'd.â The bracken was our couch; our bridal sheets, Her green simarre, by her divinely spread, The while she wished to hide and would not hide Her tender shuddering sighs, her flowerlike smiles That bloomed in swift succession with crystal tears For dewdrops, and the dazzling blood that welled In momentaneous surges and overcame Her face, her neck, her bosom with a tide, Wherein, as in the mirror of the wave, An unseen dawn its rosy shadow threw. She was the virgin goddess of the night; And she lay down with me; and in my arms She sacrificed the chastity of heaven; And swooned with happiness, and whispered close, âI see my palace on the highest heightâ The one you told me of. Thither will we, So stealthily, when our first boy is born, And take with sudden wonder all my kin.â That was the burden of her nuptial song Until the tumult of her own delight Invaded all her being. ThenâO then, Her molten crescent dripped with honeyed fireâ A light to love by had we needed light; With fragrant kisses, like a magic cup For ever brimming with the wine of life, Her mouth was at my lips; her golden voice In murmurs and unworded rapture told Voluptuous secrets of our rich embrace; And over us the moonless, starless night A velvet coverlet of darkness spread. But when her soul was satiated with love A little while before the morning broke Wanton she grew and would not be appeased. Although her crescent waned, and in its gloom Her eyes and eyelids withered, and her face Grew haggard with the ashen stain of death, Yet would she cling to me, one hungry sense Alone alive, and âTake me, take me, love, Or else I die!â she sobbed, her arms and limbs About me writhen like a serpent's coils. Once when a momentary lull reprieved The travail of her body, she shrieked aloud, âAnathema! A man has conquered me! The end has come! Insufferable hell Begin again and disembowel earth With hotter fire than any stolen from heaven, To be a living sepulchre of pain For that pernicious prophet whose presage slyâ Gods!âvanished gods! dead gods!âI heeded not . . . Because it was to be!â Then at my ear, And through her grinding teeth, âSave me from death,â She saidââby love! Save me from death by love!â Such being the tragic loom of it, and she And I the warp and woof, I still renewed The anguish that was ecstasy at first; But as I drained my life in one resolved Embrace, her fire went out, her deity Decayed; and by the sullen clouded dawn That dredged the sky with dim, diffusive dust, There vanished from my sight a carrion shape, With shrivelled dugs, wry mouth and posture foul As of a naked hag on lewdness bent. With shrunk veins, empty mind, suspended will, Scarce had I noted veils and shreds of mist Hanging upon the mountains and the woods, And through my marrow felt the morning air Like curdling venom steal, when death came down, And brought about tremendous punishment For my seduction of the goddess, lust Indulged to frenzy, self-deceit and dark Betrayal of the ethereal universe. Without a pang I died; but, shrieking, waked In the last Hell remaining, Hell unknown To men before my visit, appalling Hell, The Hell of Deity where Other World Intolerable agony endured. Although the instantaneousness of Hell Extorted sudden outcry, yet the thought That immaterial falsehood of the spirit Had not escaped; but that the gods themselves A fierier flame, a fiercer torture knew Than any penalty infernal dealt The human victims of their wrath divine, Inventors, patrons, connoisseurs of Hell, Was as a drop of water on my tongue, A chord of music, and a breath of wind Amid the dismal noise, the withering heat, The awful restlessness, the live despair. Beside me on the threshold the goddess stood, As young, as full of zest, and as divine As when she passed me on the mountain-top. I also in the splendour of my youth Entered the dread inferno of the gods; For, that the anguish there might still surpass The utmost pain in every other hell, The spirit and strength of all the denizens, Restored at once, were to the height maintained By the pure flame they breathed, the atmosphere Being also nurture and stimulant, and one Exhaustive torment of that shrine of woe: That all the essences of Other World Should breathe, should feed on Hell like plants on air, And should become in every artery, nerve, Secretion, organ, bone and muscle, Hell, Insufferable Hell, was the supreme Distinction, the redundancy superb In hellishness that made the Hell of the Gods Pre-eminent Hell. But over and above The general torture native in the airâ So stringent and imbuing that the might Combined, the majesty and pride of gods, The highest, Jove, Poseidon, Mulciber, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Woden, Surtur, Mars, Could not have borne in silence a moment's throeâ Each individual, from the daintiest elf, That fed on perfume once and bathed in dew, To Cyclopean figures vast, of yore The armourers and farriers of the gods, Endured the unendurable, impaled Against a towering cliff of adamant, Sheer as a waterfall and smooth as glass, Broad as the bastion of an island realm, And topaz-hued by reflex of the flame That filled the wide and lofty vault of Hell, Its atmosphere: impalement manifold, The pegs and bolts, the hooks, the skewers and beams Being of the soul of metal, an element Unknown on earth, that where it pierces lives An aching life metallic, in pain itself, And to the wounded spirit imparting power Transcendent to experience agonies That, felt less keenly, with a single pang Had ended every god. Supine or prone The fairies, kobolds, dwarfs, by pins and nails Transfixed like butterflies and beetles, screamed With stretched mouths, wings a-buzz and wriggling limbs; And though they wrenched and wrung their bodies,âthey, And every sufferer there, incessantlyâ The puncture of the impalement sucked the stake Like a fierce mouth, such was the energy Constrictive in the magic metal lodged. Titans and Thurses huge, dropped from the height, On ganches pinedâsuch groups of barbs and spikes As on the walls of orient cities clutched The mangled malefactor, dying long In hideous misery: through the bowels thrust, Hooked by a leg and in both shoulders griped, The storm-leviathan, enormous Thrym, Terrific anguish from his cavernous maw Uttered continually; beside him hung Uncouthly by the head, his eyehole pierced By other malice than the wandering Greek's, His bulk contorted and immanely trussed On giant prongs that dug through either thigh, And, curving, gashed his midriff, ocean's son, The cloud-high Polyphemus, writhed and roared. Upon a skewer, that through their navels stuck, Vulcan and Mars, with Venus wedged between, Bellowed discordant frenzy as they bit And clawed each other. Juno stitched to Jove By latticed scythesâausterely, back to backâ Bayed like a she-wolf maddening at the moon, While her great consort's lion throat unstopped Pealed out the diapason of all woe: Chronos with Rhea, Baal with Ashtaroth, Woden with Freya, such espousal had, In couples ganched, and howling deep and shrill Hell's hymenean. There Apollo, racked Among a grove of scimitars that grew Like sedges through his deity, suppressed His tuneless note a moment when he saw His conqueror come so soon to share his fate; Thor, clamorous on an antlered couch, pronounced Infernal welcome; and Aidoneus stabbed In every limb and organ, lifted up A piercing voice that for a breath outsoared The thundrous quire of Hell. This heard and seen Within the instant of my entrance, more I could not mark for the appalling pain That the first breath of Hell instilled, but flung My unheard cry into the whelming noise, Absorbed in monstrous torment. Yet I knew, By the inherent faculty of Hell, That my divine companion of the night Impaled throughout her sumptuous deityâ Beside Athene strung upon a stake!â Wriggled and yelled abominably hurt. Also I knew (in the one instant still, Like all the happening in the Hell of the Gods) That on the adamantine bastion hung A figure crucified, which was myself; And that beside myself there hanging, I, A second time, being he who entered, nailed Through either palm at arm's length drawn, and through My feet together pressed, beheld myself Still standing at the entry, mouth agape And pouring horror to behold a third Appearance of myself against the wall By hands and feet affixed! Then I, the man I am, the very man, beside the three Phantasmas of myself was also nailed: For I, as man, was guilty of the gods, Guilty of God; and in myself partook Uniquely of the nature of the gods, Having supped upon their food, and having loved A deity, and been by her belov'd. âFour persons in the Godheadâthe Sire, the Son, The Holy Spirit, and the Evil One,â The faculty of Hell within me cried; And in the instant, though that instant seemed Eternity quadrupled, so intense My fourfold agony became, the last Of all the Hells, and the most terrible Desisted wholly; and I stood once more Alone upon the mountain of my choice, And saw the northern dawn awake the world. The mechanism of automatic fate Brought it about that when I thought to die Eternally, I died to live again. Thus in my night adventure and my death I purged the world of the last remnant left Of Other World, the hideous Hell of the Gods, Of virgin worship, and, in myself, of Godâ Pernicious slander of material truth So terribly avenged in the last Hell. And thus I made the world a fit abode For greatness and the men who yet may be; And can myself with joy become again The mountains and the ocean, the winds, the flowers, And life and death, and fear and love and hope, And tender sorrow and heavy grief, and all Humanity, and all that thinks and is: Remaining still the conscious mystery throned Among the stars, with systems round beset, By throngs of constellations haunted, discs Gigantic looming white on every hand, And married globes whose orbits intertwine, Whose burnished lights instinct with diverse stains Revolve about each other deep in space, Saffron with sapphire, emerald with ruby-red, And purple stars with topaz doubles sphered, Or wonderful as instruments attuned To some new ravishment of keen accord, In virgin gold and lilac burning bright, A stellar passion of harmonious fire. I dare not, must not die: I am the sight And hearing of the infinite; in me Matter fulfils itself; before me none Beheld or heard, imagined, thought or felt; And though I make the mystery known to men, It may be none hereafter shall achieve The perfect purpose of eternity; It may be that the Universe attains Self-knowledge only once; and when I cease To see and hear, imagine, think and feel, The end may come, and matter, satisfied, Devolve once more through wanton change, and tides Of slow relapse, suns, systems, galaxies, Back to ethereal oblivion, pure Accomplished darkness, might immaculate Augmenting everlastingly in space. Me, therefore, it beseems while life endures, To haunt my palace in the Milky Way, And into music change the tumult high That echoes through the vast, unvaulted courts Interminable, where the nebulÃ¦ Evolving constellations, their spindles whirl; Me it beseems to take my joy in heaven, Revealing glory by my soul conceived, And by my soul begotten, in the rapt Cohabitation with eternity. EPILOGUE THE LAST JOURNEY I felt the world a-spinning on its nave, I felt it sheering blindly round the sun; I felt the time had come to find a grave: I knew it in my heart my days were done. I took my staff in hand; I took the road, And wandered out to seek my last abode. Hearts of gold and hearts of lead Sing it yet in sun and rain, âHeel and toe from dawn to dusk, Round the world and home again.â O long before the bere was steeped for malt, And long before the grape was crushed for wine, The glory of the march without a halt, The triumph of a stride like yours and mine Was known to folk like us, who walked about, To be the sprightliest cordial out and out! Folk like us, with hearts that beat, Sang it too in sun and rainâ âHeel and toe from dawn to dusk, Round the world and home again.â My feet are heavy now, but on I go, My head erect beneath the tragic years. The way is steep, but I would have it so; And dusty, but I lay the dust with tears, Though none can see me weep: alone I climb The rugged path that leads me out of timeâ Out of time and out of all, Singing yet in sun and rain, âHeel and toe from dawn to dusk, Round the world and home again.â Farewell the hope that mocked, farewell despair That went before me still and made the pace. The earth is full of graves, and mine was there Before my life began, my resting-place; And I shall find it out and with the dead Lie down for ever, all my sayings saidâ Deeds all done and songs all sung, While others chant in sun and rain, âHeel and toe from dawn to dusk, Round the world and home again.â</field>
