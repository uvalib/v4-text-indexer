      <field name="fulltext">Songs of Killarney. THE GIRL WITH THE COWS. âO shiel, O Shiel, We're dead from the reel, And destroyed at the way that our colleens are teazing us; So tell us a story Of love or of glory, To soften their hearts and to set them on pleasing us.â âIs it tired toe and heel Of planxty and reel? And your sweethearts are cross to youâboys, is it so? Then make way in the middle For me and the fiddle, And I'll tell you the tale of the Colleen na Mo.â O the happiest orphan that ever was seen, Was Nora Maguire at the age of eighteen; Her father and mother both died at her birth, So grief for their sakes didn't trouble her mirth. Nora Maguire was the flower of the girls, Wid her laughin' blue eye and her sunny bright curls, Wid her mouth's merry dimple, her head's purty poise, And a foot that played puck right and left wid the boys: Yes! her looks were a fortun'; yet curous to tell Sweet Nora Maguire was an heiress as well, For her father had left his dear child at his death Half a hundred of cows at the side of the heath, Where Nora na Mo in a handsome slate house Wid her granny looked after the sheep and the cows; For behind all the fun that her features evince, Mistress Nora Maguire has lashins of sinse; But though Nora was careful she never was mean, But dear as the dew to the hot summer plain, She'd go stealin' the poor and the sick to relieve, Unbeknownst in the hush of the dawn or the eve: And no girl in the service at chapel took part Who followed the priest wid a faithfuller heart, And no sound in the anthem rose truer and higher Than the fresh fervent voice of sweet Nora Maguire: But that didn't make darlin' Nora desire To adjourn to the convent on lavin' the choir;â No! It's thinkin' I am, where's the use to conceal? Her first thought after chapel was Patrick O'Neale, Wid his dark handsome looks, and his deep earnest voice, The pet of the colleensâthe pride of the boys. For there wasn't a boy in Dunkerron was able To dance on the ground as he could on the table; Or sing in ould Irish wid beautif'ller shakes, Sweeter songs or laments at our weddings and wakes; Or tell by the fire of a dark winter's night Tales that crowded us closer together for fright. And where's the turf cuttin' or boghole so broad, But he'd clear like a hare hoppin' off of the road; At what fence would he falter or alter his steps, And who could approach him at throwin' three leaps; And on Sunday at hurley, who rooshed on the ball Wid such fury as Pat, through the thick of them all,â Or when it came buzzin' like a bee through the air Caught it cleaner, and pucked it as strong or as fair? But for all these distractions the boy wasn't spoilt, And no honest poor Irishman ever has toiled For the wife and the childer wid heartier zeal Than did Pat for his mother, good Widow O'Neale; For his fatherâGod rest him!âhad drooped down and died When the praties turned black through the whole country-side. And soon after his uncle Cornelius, I've heard, From New York to his brother and sister sent word, That the passage of both he was wishful to pay, And they'd find a new home on his side of the say. So they wentâwid their poor mother's blessin' and tears, Micky, twelve, but a stout little lad for his years, And Honora, the darlin' sweet child of eleven, All aloneâbut in safety wid the blessing of heaven. Now Widow O'Neale, the brave woman had once For a twelvemonth been novice and lived wid the nuns, Though when that was outâI've no time for the taleâ She took Patrick's fatherâinstead of the veilâ Well for nun and for novice, there's time and to spare For the needle and thread from devotion and prayerâ And that time was well spent by the Colleen who now Has no cause to repent her noviciate vow; For though many's the night she's gone fastin' to bed, Little Patrick to treat to some meat or some bread, Though it's many's the beautiful sunshiny day She's sewed herself blind for his schoolin' to pay, Still an' all sure she managed to struggle along Till her Patrick, now growin' up hearty and strong, Came home from the haggard one night in July, Shoutin,' âMother mavrone; bid your needle good-bye! I'm to have a man's wages on the Master's estate, And help teach at the night schoolâMother, isn't it great!â So when the spuds whitened in the gardens again Young Patrick O'Neale, now the pride of the men, Foot to foot down the ridge wid O'Flaherty pressed, Who of all pratee-diggers was counted the best; And after inspectin' the mowers at work In his glebe on the hill, Parson Fetherston Bourke, âWhy, Patrick O'Neale, boy,â said he, wid a laugh, âWhy, Patrick, you're worth any man and a half,ââ For your clane cliver coorse wid your scythe through the grass Was a picture, more power to you, Patrick, it was. And yourselves would be pleased to have heard him at night In the Master's new school-house, so smart and polite, Explainin' the earth's longitudinal plan To a wild-headed stump of a mountainy man, Or settin' a sum in Algebbra, begor, To the priest's crabbed nephew and one or two more. But when it struck ten by the clock overhead âGood-nightâ to the boys our young schoolmaster said; Gathered up âThe Six Booksâ and the slates for the night, Locked the door and made off, wid a screech of delight, Through the deep mountain gloom to the darlin' red star Of his mother's turf fire winkin' welcome from far. Five minutesâno moreâyou allowed to that mile, Then into the cabin you'd swing through the stile, Catch and kiss the good widdy wid a wonderful smack Before she well knew that her boyo was back. Then down to the milk and the murphies you'd sit, While the dog wagged his tail and looked up for a bit, And the thief of a cat on the table sprang up, Knowin' well you could never refuse her a sup; For the proverb runs true,âto my thinkin', at laste,â That man's a good man that's the friend of the baste. Well, I've hinted that even as home through the grass Mistress Nora went trippin' direct out of mass, Across the girl's mind there'd be sure for to steal Some notion or other of Patrick O'Neale. Now wasn't that strange, for though sweethearts for ever, Yerra yes, though the best of the boys on the river, From the Captain commandin' the Bay wid his cutter To the proudest on shore, they were all in a flutterâ Though a huckster might furnish three iligant stalls Wid the brooches and bonnets, the dresses and shawls That the cleverest courters from far and from near Had given her, galore, at each fair in the year; Though none who'd not seen it could have any iday Of the spring trout and salmon they sent her on Friday; Though they put her the question in every way outâ In poems so romantic or merely by mout', In English and Irishâand as I've heard tell, One bould hedge-schoolmaster in Latin as wellâ And though, which you'll count the most curous of all, Not a look nor a word had he ever let fall That could lave her the laste right in raison to feel She'd put the comether on Patrick O'Nealeâ P'r'aps now 'twas the jealousy vexed her to-day, To see Patrick funnin' wid Fanny O'Shea, Or to meet him to-morrow, the full of his cap Of purple whorts pourin' in Mary Moore's lap; While his manners to her were so courtly and grand, Holdin' out on the crops wid his hat in his hand, Or discussin' her cows wid a dignity such as A Prince of the Blood would employ to a duchess; Or perhaps 'twas the pride, that wid Nora was highâ That of all who were soft on her, sorra a boy, For looks or for manners, could match wid O'Nealeâ And yet his the one heart that the girl couldn't steal. But whativer the raisonâbeganniesâ'twas so, When the county came courtin' the Colleen na Mo, Her thoughts they kept runnin', surprisin' to say, Most of all on the man that was laste in her way. But all you sweet girls who attend to my tale, Lest by this you think coldly of Patrick O'Neale, Faith, I'm forced to confessâthat when Nora believed Patrick's heart was his own, sure herself was deceivedâ For of all of her suitors so rich and so high, None loved her as deep as that poor pisant boy. But why hadn't he courage his heart to declare, And to up wid his story and axe her to share His fortune for ever? I answer you, sure, 'Twas the pride that prevented him, being so poorâ Yes! that was the cause why, at bonfire or patron, When the rest all came round complimentin', and flatter'n', To her friendly âGood day!â âGood day kindly, to you,â Was your only remark to her all the dance through. And that was the raison, one night at Adair's, When after a jigâthrough the scarceness of chairsâ The girls should sit down on the knees of the men Till such time as the music should start up again, Each girl wid her partner and Nora wid you, You must preten' your seat wasn't aqual to two, And sit down on the floorâwid her planked up behind, Though I know well which seat had been most to her mind. But when quite out of hearing, unseen and alone, To himself he'd go over each look and each tone Of Nora's he'd treasured away in his mind, At some moment she'd fretted to think him unkind; And as he went clippin' the briar wid his bill, Or rowed up the river, or reaped on the hill, Some fancy of Nora would come to him still. The arbutus fruit now, or a stretch of the sky Would recall her red lip or her laughin' blue eye, The heath flower to-day of her blushes would hint, And to-morrow the furze took her tresses' own tintâ The spring leaped with her laugh over pebbles of pearl, And the sailing swan signed him his white-bosomed girl, While âNoraâ for ever his oar on the bay, And âNoraâ his spade in the garden used say, And âNora,â still âNora,â to the tunes she loved best, His heart it kept beating the time in his breast. So that pair of young people their feelings used smother, Widout each thinkin' either could care for the other. But the rude blow at last will afford you a hint Of the fire that's concealed in the core of the flint; And the beautiful brim that's unnoticed by day, On the gloomiest night glitters most on the say, And so even its secretest feeling'll start In the hour of distress from the haughtiest heart. And 'twas so with these two. Now the mornin' was fair, Wid the mountains distinct from Dunloe to Kenmare, But at noon the white cloud Carn Tual had kissed, And soon after the Saw melted off in the mist, And lower still lower the mist it crept down, Till its curtain had covered up Atthin and Beown, And lower still lower it swept for the plain, While you heard Bullig breaker start roarin' for rain. 'Twas a Saturday, surely, wid only the Sunday, Betune it and the fair on the followin' Monday. And, signs by, down each dark boreen then, for ever, And from out every fog-steamin' ford on the river, Cows and sheep they came startin', till the roads were alive, For the world like a swarm of bees smoked from a hive. Well! that very same Saturday, long before even The lark mounted up wid his matins to heaven, O'Neale had been facin' as if it was day, Surely, but sad, up the mountainy way Back out of Glen Caragh, where he'd had a call To his mother's own brother's son's funeralâ Surely, but sad, you may think, at the start, Till the light of the sun began warmin' his heart; And yerra, ye'll not think the worse of the boy, If I tell you, before every dew-drop was dry, His tears for the cousin no longer used fall; And ye won't blame him much, if ye blame him at all, When I'm forced to confess that at noon upon Gloragh His thoughts they had turned round completely to Nora; Till sure an' he shocked himself singin' a song Of the Colleen na Mo, as he travelled along. So he trassed away dreamin' of Nora na Mo, While the mist it crept down to the valleys below Unknownst to O'Neale, for each inch of the way He'd have travelled as surely by night as by day. Still an' all at long last on the edge of a bog There puffed in his face such a powderin' fog, That he gave a great start and looked doubtin'ly down, To be sure he'd made off the right track to the town; And he just then could see to the left of his path, Roundin' out of the vapour the ould Irish Rath, And says he wid a smile, âWhy I might be a hound For facin' so fair for the Barony's bound, But I'd best hurry on then, or Mother machree, It's in dread for me out in the mist but you'll be.â So he started to run, when he heard from above The voice of the girl that had stolen his love: âMagrina, magrina, magrinashin oge, Come hither, my Laidir, come Kitty, you rogue, Come up, Blackbird, come, Snow, to the beautiful house.â â'Tis the Colleen na Mo,â he said, âcallin' her cows.â But her voice sounded sadly and strange in his ear, And the heart of O'Neale began knockin' for fear, And he looked and he saw risin' up from below, The Shadow of the Shape of the Colleen na Mo Growin' greater for ever, till a monster of black, Like the Spirit of Death, it stood out of the track; And O'Neale knew the warnin'âand shouted, âStand back, Stand back for your life!â but the shadow went still, Wid its arms wavin' wild on the brow of the hill, Then it trembled, and balanced, and staggered, and fell, Down, down wid the moan of a muffled death-bell. And as a man held by a horrible dream Wrastles hard, till at last he starts up wid a screamâ So he stood there, how long himself never could tellâ For the mist of a sudden seemed changed by a spell To a fierce fiend that caught him unknownst from behind, And held him hard breathin', and his eyes starin' blind, Wid cruel white hands knotted into his neck, And a hiss in his ears like a poisonous snakeâ Till he wakes up at last wid a terrible groan And finds himself there on the mountain alone Wid the white mist around driftin' dreamily on. âAnd was it a dream, after all, then?â he cried, When a sheep-dog it ran barkin' up to his side; And the dread it returned at the voice of the dog, And he stooped down and looked at it into the fog, And he knew it was Nora's, and his heart it stood still. âNow, what are you doin', Jack, here on the hill? Where's your Nora, mavrone?â and the dog in reply Starts whinin' and draggin' away at the boy. And he knew it had answered as plain as if spoke, And says he, âJack, I'm wid you, though my heart it is broke.â So, layin' a sorrowful hand on its head, The poor boy went afterâthe dumb creature led From Drumtine to Coomassig, as still as the dead. Here the dog was at fault, but soon wid a bound Followed on a fresh foot-print, his nose to the ground. And Patrick looked closer and strained through the dark, And knew it was Nora's by the straight slender mark. And he stooped down and kissed it, and Jack he stood still On the top of Coomassig and barked wid a will. And âNora,â Pat shouted, âO, Nora na Mo, Is it clifted you are on the mountain below? O answer, acushla;â but sorra a word, But only the voice of an eagle he heard, Wheelin' in through the terrible darkness beneath, And he shuddered and sobbed, âIt comes scentin' her death, And not as much light as to stone it away. O, God, that the darkness would turn into day!â âCome, Jack, we'll go down to the foot of the rock And protect the poor corpse from the ravenous flock;â And he coaxed him to come, but the dog wouldn't stir, So alone down the clift Pat went searchin' for her; But as he was going, a far hullahoo Rose out of the distance, and into his view Red torches came wavin' their way up the hill, And he laughed a wild laugh, through his wanderin' will, And he cried, âIs it wake-lights yez are drawin' near? Hurry up, then, and show me the corpse of my dear.â And the red lights approached, and a voice wid the light, âWho are ye in distress on the mountain to-night?â And he answered, âCome up, for our name it is Death, Wid the eagle above and the white-worm beneath; But the death-lights that hover by night o'er the grave Will restore us our dead, when your torches can save.â âWhat is it, O'Neale, man? How wildly you rave,â And the hand of Murt Shea, the best friend that he had, Was lovingly laid on the arm of the lad. âO, Murt, give me hould of that splinter,â he said, âAnd let me look down on the face of the dead, For Nora Maguire, Murt, my own secret love, Has fallen from the clift of Coomassig above.â âIs it she, wirra, wirra, the pride of us all? Do you say that the darlin's been killed by a fall? Ologone, my poor Pat, and you loved her at heart.â Then O'Neill groaned again, âSure I've searched every part, And no sign of her here at the foot of the clift.â And the rest they came up, and the bushes they sift, But sorra a trace to the right or the left. Then O'Neale shouted, âCome, every man of ye lift His fire altogether.â And one said, âI see Somethin' hangin' high up from the juniper tree.â â'Tis herself,â shouted Pat, wid his hand to his brow, âHow far from the top is that juniper bough?â âTen foot of a fall,â said a mountain gossoon, âWid no tussocks betune them?â âWid nothin' betune.â âHave yez ere a rope handy, boys?â âDivle a rope! And not nearer nor Sneem for the likes you could hope.â âCome hither, gossoon, and be off wid this splinter, For 'tis you know the mountain; away widout hinder To the nearest good haggard, and strip the sugane, Not forgettin' a sop of the freshest finane. Brustig, brustig, alanah!â and hardly the rest Had followed O'Neale up the vapoury crest, To the spot that the faithful, wise hound wouldn't pass, When the boy he was back wid the hayropes and grass. Then says Pat, leanin' down wid a splinter of light, âGod bless the good dogâafter all he was right. Ten foot underneath usâshe's plainly in sight. Now give hither the ropes, and hould on while I twist.â So he caught the suganes up like threads in his fist, And twined them and jined them a thirty foot length, Fourplait to a thickness of terrible strength. Then roped it around the two biggest boys there, To see was it fit for supportin' a pair. And he easily lifted the two through the air, Up and down, till he'd proved it well able to bear. âNow make the rope fast to me, boys, while I go Down the side of the clift for the Colleen na Mo. Livin' or deadâtho' I'm hopeful for all, There's life in her stillâtho' she's kilt from the fall.â Then he turns to one side, and he whispers Murt Shea, âIf I'm killed from the clift of Coomassig to-day, Come promise me faithful you'll stand to the mother Like a son, till she's help from the sister and brother. And give her this kiss, and I'll meet her again In the place where's no poverty, sorrow or pain.â And he promisedâand all they shook hands wid O'Neale, And he cheered them and said, âHave no dread that we'll fail, For I'd not be afeard, why, to balance the Pope Himself from the clift by so hearty a rope.â So a torch in his hand, and a stick in his teeth, And his coat round his throat the boys lowered him beneath. And all but Murt Shea, then, they couldn't make out The coat round his throat, and the stick in his mout'. But it wasn't for long they'd the doubt in their mind, For they saw his torch quenched wid a noise like the wind, And âSteady above,â came his voice from below. Then heavy wings flapped wid a scream and a blow. â'Tis the eagles,â they cried, âat the Colleen na Mo.â But an old man amongst them spoke up and he said, â'Tis the eagles for sartin, but not at the dead, For they'll not touch the corpseâmurther, but for the mist, 'Tis I could have told you that this was their nest.â âIt's O'Neale that they're atâpull him back, or they'll tear The poor boy to pieces below in the air.â And they shouted together the eagles to scare. And they called to O'Neale from the edge of the height, âShe's dead, Pat, she's dead, never mind her to-night. But come back, or the eagles 'll pick out your sight.â And they made for to pull; but he cries, âIf you do, I give you my oath that I'll cut the rope through.â And they b'lieved him, and waited wid hearts beatin' loud, Screechin' down at the birds through the vapoury cloud, Showerin' splinters for ever to give the boy light, And warnin' him watch to the left or the right, As each eagle in turn it would fly at his head, Till he dropped one below in the darkness for dead, And the other flew off wid' a yell through the night. Then they felt the rope slacken as he crossed to the bough, Then tighten againâand he called to them âNow!â And they knew that the dangerous moment was come. So wid wrist draggin' shoulder, tight finger to thumb, And tooth crushing tooth in the silence of death, They drew up the two from the blackness beneath. There'd been a long stretch of delightful spring weather, But this was the day beat the rest altogether, Over mountain and valley and riverâOyeh! There was never for ever so darlin' a dayâ Wid its purty pale primroses shrinkin so shy From the bachelor butterfly's kiss-and-go-by, And wid hawthorns like bridesmaids come out in the air, Arrangin' white wreaths in their iligant hair. And so thought a fiddler, fiddle on back, Steppin' for town by the mountainy track. âBut,â says he, âwhat's the raison the people are dressed, All wid shoes on their feet, in their holiday best? 'Tisn't Sunday, thenâbarrin' the priests were astray, Ere yesterday mornin' off out at Rossbeigh; And a Saint's Day it's not, for I know them by heart, The whole box an' dice they observe in this part. Must be then, begorra, I make no mistake, In concludin' it's either a weddin' or wake; Though I shouldn't have thought the worst omadhaun round 'D have chosen such weather for goin' underground.â When who should come hurryin' down the boreen But Honor O'Connor dressed out like a queen, Wid her hair in one wonderful plait, and upon itâ Like a bird on its nestâa sweet bit of a bonnetâ And a green sash that showed her fine figure for'nint, And flouncin' behind her, the beautif'llest print, Folded into her hand, just enough for a hint Of as tidy an ankle as ever set stepâ So the girl she came on, wid the laugh on her lip, Till she sighted the fiddler, and âShiel, dear,â said she, (For I should have remarked that the fiddler was me)â âWhat a stranger you areâtho' returnin' aright, For we've terrible want of your fiddle to-night;ââ âBut what wonderful doin's are goin' on below, Honor, acora?â âAh! nonsense! You knowâ Why, Nora Maguire's to be married to-day.â âGlory be to God!âIs it true what you say? Well, Nora na Mo, but I'm wishin' you joy: And who, in the name of good fortune's, the boy?â âArrah who should it be, then, but Mr. O`Neale? But you're bothered, I see.â So she up wid the tale Of the Colleen na Mo that I've told to yez all, Explainin' how Nora wasn't kilt by the fall, Though she took the brain fever immadiate on that,â And how she wint ravin' for ever on Pat And her love, and the pity the boy was so poor,â And how hopeful from this of performin' her cure, Good Doctor O'Kydd, ere the crisis came on, Goes off to consider wid ould Father Johnâ And how the two wint wid one mind to the Squire To tell him the danger of Nora Maguireâ And the Master, said he, âI've my eye on the lad, And I want a sub-agent. He'll suit me bedadâ I'll send for him up to the Castle to-day.â And he got no refusal from Pat, you may say. And how the good Doctor told Nora, the night When the crisis was on herâby accident quiteâ About Patrick. Then how a great longin' for life, And maybe the notion she'd yet be his wife, Came over the girlâand the terrible flood Of the fever subsided away from her blood; And though yerrah so wastedâto see her you'd cryâ In a month she was up, and av coorse Patrick by; And, concludin', how hardly the winter was out, When through all of Dunkerron 'twas rumoured about, Nora'd taken O'Neale, and there wasn't a doubt When the good priest he published them three weeks ago, And to-day they'll be married in the chapel below. Then the marriage-bell started as Honor and I Stepped into the town wid our hearts full of joy; So off we two darted, and just at the porch Met Nora, the darlin', drivin' up to the church, And Pat, you may guess, wasn't long in the lurch. And a power of company surely were there, Of the highest and lowest all down from Kenmare, For the Squire and the Quality seated around, Side by side wid the lowliest pisant you found. And the whole string of sweethearts who'd courted in vainâ (For not a man of them would give Nora pain By seemin' heartbroken or wishful to slight Her choice of O'Neale) had agreed to unite To see the girl's weddin'âand surely for this, too, Whin ould Father John had them married and blessed, too, They each had her thanksâYerra yes! and a kiss, too. And somehow myself was mixed up wid that lot, And stole the best kiss that I ever yet got. âArrah! Shiel, is it you? Why, none of us knew Yourself was a sweetheart of Nora's here, too.â âWas it Shiel, why, that kissed me?â â'Twas so; then, bedad: Hould his hands for me, Murphy.â âNow would you, my lad?ââ âMercy, Nora, and whisper! 'Twas just in advance That I took itâfor playin' to-night at your dance.â THE FOSTER SISTERS. When your mother lay dyin' And passed to her rest, The same gentle breast Both our wants was supplyin',â If for only that feelin' I'd be yours, Lady Alice, Though my home's but a shealin', And the roof of a palace Covers you, Lady Alice! Yes! to feel but that of you, Foster-sister, acora, Would have left to your Nora No choice but to love you. Even if your fair breast Hid a heart full of malice, Instead of the best In shealin' or palace, My poor Lady Alice! Yet just as the dew On a lily-leaf slender Lies tremblin' so tender And trustful and true, Till the sun's selfish power, Most sudden and cruel, Wastes away the white jewel And withers the flower,â So it was with poor Alice. For you trusted his love, As simply confidin' His honour and pride in, As in heaven above; And you married, mavrone, Lord Arthur, Lord Arthur; Though now, ologone, In your grave you'd be rather Than his wife, Lady Alice! So that though I had once A foolish ambition For your noble condition, Like a foolish young dunce, Had I known, as I do, What then was preparin' For me and for you, That wish I'd been sparin' My poor Lady Alice. And instead, then, for you Half my hopes I'd forsaken,â Half your troubles I'd taken,â If only, aroo, Through that you'd been born Wid me in our shealin', Safe away from his scorn And black bitter feelin', My poor Lady Alice! THE IRISH SPINNING WHEEL. âSing me a song, Shiel, Shielâ As my foot on the reel Goes guidin' the wheel Along. For I keep better time To a musical rhyme, Than without.â âNo doubtâ But Roseen, yourself start a tuneâ For I've heard How a bird That sings by the light of the moon, Away over the ocean, Once took up a notion, The vain little elf, that he'd fly To Ireland itself on the sly, And prove all the songs of our sky Wid the tone Of his own, Could never at all at all vieâ And he thought himself surely the best, And 'twas true for him p'r'aps of the rest; But we've all understood Meetin' you in the wood, As you warbled âThe Land of the West.â He should say, He'd no chance Wid you. So away Into France He flew.â âBehave, Shiel, Yerra, don't you feel How your blarneyin' talk is delayin' my reel; If you won't sing a song, As I'm spinnin' along, Be offâfor you're idlin' myself and the wheel.â âIs it so? O! Vo! If off I should go Widout that I make you the music, machreeâ Down here, My dear, From this seat At your feet, I'll up wid the song that's the dearest to me.â SONG. Show me a sight, Bates for delight An ould Irish wheel wid a young Irish girl at it. O! No! Nothin' you'll show, Aquals her sittin' and takin' a twirl at it. Look at her there, Night in her hairâ The blue ray of day from her eye laughin' out on us! Faix, an' a foot, Perfect of cut, Peepin' to put an end to all doubt in us That there's a sight, Bates for delight An ould Irish wheel wid a young Irish girl at it. O! No! Nothin' you'll show, Aquals her sittin' an' takin' a twirl at it. See! the lamb's wool Turns coarse an' dull By them soft, beautiful, weeshy, white hands of her. Down goes her heel, Roun' runs the wheel, Purrin' wid pleasure to take the commands of her. Then show me a sight, Bates for delight An ould Irish wheel wid a young Irish girl at it. O! No! Nothin' you'll show, Aquals her sittin' an' takin' a twirl at it. Talk of Three Fates, Seated on seats, Spinnin' and shearin' away till they've done for me. You may want three For your massacree, But one fate for me, boys, and only the one for me. And Isn't that fate, Pictured complate, An ould Irish wheel wid a young Irish girl at it? O! No! Nothin' you'll show, Aquals her sittin' an' takin' a twirl at it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPRING VOICES. SPRING'S SUMMONS. Fark! the Spring again From their bowers hidden All her tender train Blithesomely has bidden. âWake, O wake! for now at last Cruel Winter's reign is past.â So her little babes the buds Rosy-red with innocent sleep From their cradles in the woods Pretty wonderers upward peep Through the unfathomed firmament; Now with earthward gaze intent Eager mark how far below Golden flowers and flowers of snow Gladden all the garden-row, Or like stars on quiet seas Daisies light the verdant leas; Whilst the faithful robins sing, âCruel Winter turns to Spring.â Then that Thornâtoo fond for waitingâ Leaf with blossom antedatingâ All his naked ebon branches With sweet snows abundant blanches. These therefore the breezy showers Sweep like far-seen avalanches Sudden from our Island Bowers, Nor let their silver magic stay To match the blossomed hawthorn-spray. Next in fragrant order meet, To the Season's summons sweet, Violet, primrose, daffodilly, Cowslip, harebell, white wood-lily, All around by bank and field, Sweeping common, dell concealed, Their soft charms to Zephyr yield. He forthwithâmost false of Airsâ With the bees his secret shares. Therefore these with sudden sheen, Glancing golden o'er the green, Deftly store from cup and bell, Clear quintessent hydromel. Now on instant raptures bent, Of aught else improvident, All in robes of rainbow dye, Nature's fool the butterfly Up and down in rash unthrift, To and fro with ceaseless shift, On, on, from flower to flower, for aye delights to drift. See! the cautious Oak at last, Owning angry Winter past, Spreads his smiling leavesâin haste, Lest the roving woodsman dread, Haply holding him for dead, Plying horrid wound on wound, With gleaming axe should bear him groaning to the ground. Then with emulous blossoms gay, Snowy chestnutâsnowy may Laugh by every woodland way, Then the blushing lilac kisses His laburnum's golden tresses. And, while sheep-bells mingle sweet With the new-born lambkin's bleat, Loud the pairing thrushes sing, âWinter-time has turned to Spring.â Now to Man that happy Voice Cries in turn, âRejoice! Rejoice Come, O come! for now at last, Lo, the Tyrant-King has passed. Fear no more his snows and frost, Reck not of his tempests rude, Winter o'er the seas has crossed, And his storms are all subdued.â Hush, oh hush! for first she calls In a voice most full of pity, Soft and clear, âMourners dear, From the cold unlovely walls Of your cruel, cruel city, Softly steal to me, and make your moan All alone; So shall your exceeding bitter grief Find a fond relief. âCome also an open band, Hand in hand, From your winter durance dreary, Whosoever weak and weary, Languish in the land! Press from out your sombre cities, Sick and poor, For your cure I have sights and smells and ditties Manifoldâ Potent, oh! my friends, to please you, Or a happy while to ease you, Young and old, Of your pain. âCome again. Fair and strong, Grave and thoughtless, join the throng.â âHasten here, Children dear! Haste, and with your shrill delight Fill the greenest of my glades; Whilst in gladdest giddiest flight Flying beams and flickering shades, Sharing in your frolic mirth, Go dancing, dancing with you o'er the daisied earth. âCome anon, ye lovers true, With the falling of my dew, Come, and past my faintly-figured hawthorn-row To and fro Turn with happy steps and slow; Till some soft-embowered retreat Tempt aside your willing feet; There, whilst Love a friendly shade, Weaves in your abashment's aid, Trembling youth to timorous maid, With emboldened lips confess, All your bosom's dear distress. âNor withhold, my allies three, Painter, Minstrel, Poet fond, Your sweet services from me. âSee! oh see! Artist true, At the wafture of my wand, Lake and wood and hill beyond, Purple, green, and blue, Morn's first blush, Eve's last flush, Laughingly Challenge you! Lightest, brightest, boldest Brush From the crowded city's hum, Come! Come counterfeit with art complete All my changeful colours sweet. âNext draw near, Minstrel dearâ Come, O come! for Nature's Choir This thine Art shall best inspire. Hear her opera! love its stress; All her stage this upland green, Hero true and heroine Yonder hind and shepherdess. Hark! O hark each voice repeat Passion's pleading, Feigned unheedingâ Now in mutual rapture meet; Theseâamidst a comrade chorus Clear, sonorous,â These shall be our happy singers; Whiles that hidden Harper sweet, With his eager, airy fingers, Tightly straining for his pleasure the long tresses of the pine, Sweeps them to those lovers' voices in a melody divine. Whence now shall our viol-notes Lightly laugh or wildly wail? From your gay and grieving throats, Tuneful lark and nightingale! Now for flageolet and flute Thrush and blackbird be not mute! Now for trump and clarion clear Low ye oxen, bell ye deerâ Now with silver cymbal shocks, Clash ye sudden-echoing rocks! Nor cease, O sea, at vastest interval Sounding from deep to deep thine awful organ-call. âLast of all, delighted straying From thy fevered fellow-throng, Come, O Poet, pensive weighing Words of songâ Come! my landscape fresh and fair, Choir enchanting, perfumed air All their essences most rare Thee shall lendâ Aye and so divinely blend With thy fancy's loving theme, That when thou art dead and laid In the quiet Churchyard shade, O'er that gently flowing streamâ From the quiet ingle nookâ Village youth and village maid, With the winter woodfire's aid, May list the lark or mountain brook Singing from thy faithful bookâ May see with half-closed musing eyes My waving woods, my shifting skies, And almost feel upon their brow My zephyr breathe as soft as now.â THE CLIFFS OF GLENDORE. âShe comes, she comes, the Season's Queen!â The faithful robins pipe, and preen Their ruffled plumes, associate lean The lime and larch, Lifted in one long, lustrous, green Triumphal arch. âShe comes, she comes!â on herald wing, Before her thrush and blackbird sing; Then in she sweeps, the sovereign Spring, While at her side, Love, with an arrow on his string, Doth laughing ride. Around them troop a virgin train, With mystic dance and magic strain, Loose-linked in one careering chain Of lovely mirth. âSo Spring,â he sang, âreturns to reign The willing Earth. âSo Spring returns, and, with her, Love, Whom small sweet larks in heaven above, Coy butterfly, coo-cooing dove, Fond youth and maidâ Ay, all glad hearts are telling of, But mine,â he said. âYet how divinelier bird and bee, And wind and wave would sing to me, How lovelier far by lawn and lea Thy spring would prove, Wert thou not still estranged from me, O longed-for Love!â So that dear Irish April day, Above his blue Atlantic bay, Embowered by arbutus and may, A poet cried; When âcome!â it sang; and âI obey, Sweet brook,â he sighed. And strange as lips and eyes, that seem Calling, gazing, through a dream, With summon's sweet and beckoning beam That brook ran ever, Swelling to a stately stream, A rushing river. And âcome!â it cried again to him, So clear, that o'er the grassy rim He gazed into the waters dim; But nought espied, Save bull-flags swaying great and grim Athwart the tide. And âcome!â it called him o'er and o'er, Love's voice upon the Atlantic shore; And âcome!â it cried to him once more, Then laughed âToo late,â As mid the cliffs of wild Glendore, He found his fate. THE POET'S SPRING. With an aching heart and a brain outweary, From his trembling fingers he tossed the pen, And climbed to the roof of his attic eyrie, And gazed far down on the city of men, And cried from above to the thronging people, âOh, little as ye seem, and vain and slight, Ye are smaller, slighterââand he turned to the steepleâ âMeaner and vainer in your Maker's sight!â âYea,â the bell chimed from the sacred height. âWhen death,â he sighed, âleft my pillow lonely, And my whole life loveless, hither I came From our New World sierrasâcomforted only By a far-heard echo of fame and name, The siren voice of a Phantom Shrouded; But the Mystic Shape is with clouds o'erclouded, And her sweet strain silent. Proclaim, proclaim, What may it mean? Is it well, oh bell?â And the voice from the steeple replied, âIt is well.â Once again he called to the Spirit in the Spire: âIf Fame forsake me as Love forsook, What is left of all of my heart's desire But a buried bride and a foolish book?â The bell no more made answer hollow, But a fresh voice fell on the poet's ear, A voice from the west, crying, âFollow me, followâ Flowers waken, birds warble, and streams run clear, Follow me, follow, for the Spring is here!â So the poet followed the sweet-voiced zephyr To a gay green valley in the heart of the hills, At his feet there leaped a laughing river Crowned with thorn-blossom and daffodils: Two robins aloft on an elm were singing, Two wild doves over the stream were winging, And this song was wafted from welkin and rills And bird and blossomââSad soul, be whole With a hope that shall strengthen as the seasons roll.â THE IRISH EXILE'S LOVE. With pensive eyes she passed the church, And up the leafy woodland came; Until she reached the silver birch Where, long ago, he carved her name. And âOh!â she sighed, as soft she kissed With loving lips that gentle tree, âAlone, alone, I keep the tryst, Return to Ireland, love, and me. âReturn! Columbia's realm afar, Where year by year your feet delay, We cannot match for moon or star By silver night or golden day. âHer birds are brighter far of wing A richer lustre lights her flowers; Yet still they say no bird can sing Or blossom breathe as sweet as ours. âReturn! Her levin-flashes dire Affright not here. We never know Her awful rushing prairie-fireâ The silent horror of her snow. âReturn! Her heart is wise and boldâ Her borders beautiful and freeâ Yet still the New is not the Old, Return to Ireland, love, and me.â THE MAY OF THE YEAR. O show me a season as mild and as merry As the May of the year in the Kingdom of Kerry. As the May of the year, as the May of the year, When the eyes of Atlantic, as crystal-clear As Heaven's own blue, are beaming on you; And the sun moves slowly for love of the flowers âSuch flowers, with the wild bees all a-hum,â And delights to linger above the bowers âThose very bowers, so dark and dumb, And sorrowful stripped for O, how long? But now how green! how full of song!â And the good sun gazes, with golden gaze, On the evergreens of our woodland ways: A gaze so gladâarbutus and holly Forget their wintry melancholy In diamond laughter, and he delays The happy heedless course of the hours, And looks with a lingering love-look down To do his duty To Irish beauty; And looks again, with a royal frown, Steadfast and stern, our boys to burn, To burn our boys, to a braver brown. So the good sun his course delays, For he loves to lengthen our sweet spring days. SONNET TO A HAWTHORN. When Spring returns, after so sad delay, And little birds no longer pipe âAlas!â Oft as a-field from copse to copse I pass, I mark thee, fairest, quickening day by day From bud to leafâfrom leaf to blossom gay; Till, as a queen, the lovely village lass Wreathes for her crown thy pearliest-petalled spray, Thy greenest wilding sceptres for her sway. Be with us still, beseech thee, Maiden May; Still to thy stream stoop through the springing grass. Aye! linger still, a bride before thy glass. And still too soon shall dusk the nuptial day When thy virginity, that so beauteous was, In Summer's amorous arms shall blushing melt away. SONNET TO A LABURNUM IN A DUBLIN GARDEN. Dost thou, despairful that thy lot is laid Far from the wild wood, the romantic hill, In rich dishevelment of sorrow spill Thy long locks lustrousâkiss thine own sweet shade Narcissus-like, or with the Argive maid To golden glamour yield thee half afraid? An exile's longings for some orient lea Lavish belike these glittering hoards of grief. I know not. Yet, before their summer brief Forsakes our island woods, Laburnum Tree, Again thou seem'st to blossom tears of gold. Nearer we draw, yet all that we behold Is but the splendour of thy faded leafâ No hue of healthâthe flush that all too soon is cold. DAWN AT BALLINVOIRIG. Tis scarcely four by the village clock, The dew is heavyâthe air is coolâ A mist goes up from the glassy poolâ Through the dim field ranges a phantom flock, No sound is heard but the magpie's mock. Very low is the sun in the sky, It needeth no eagle now to regard him. Is there not one lark left to reward him With the shivering joy of his long sweet cry? For his face shines sadly, I know not why. Through the ivied ruins of yonder elm There glides and gazes a sadder faceâ Spectre queen of a vanished race 'Tis the full moon shrunk to a fleeting film, And she lingers for love of her ancient realm. These are but idle fancies, I know, Framed to solace a secret grief. Look againâscorning such false reliefâ Dwarf not Nature to match thy woe. Look again! Whence do these fancies flow? What is the moon but a lamp of fire That God shall relume in His season? The sun Like a giant rejoices his race to run, With flaming feet that never tire, On the azure path of the starry choir. The lark has sung ere I left my bed, And hark! far aloft from those ladders of ligh Many songs, not one only, the morn delight; Then, Sad Heart, dream not that Nature is dead, But seek from her strength and comfort instead. THE KINGDOM OF KERRY. AN INVITATION TO IRELAND. O come to us and learn to ownâ Unless your heart's as hard as stoneâ There's not a realm around the sphere With Our Kingdom can compare. For how could river, lake, and sea In softer sister hues agree? Or hills of passionate purple-glow Far and near more proudly flow? And where will summer kiss awake Lovelier flowers by lawn or brake? Or brighter berries blush between Foliage of a fresher green? And if you miss from modern days Sweet simple-hearted human ways, Come! own such ancient virtues rare In our kingdom cherished are. The open hospitable door, The poor man's pittance to the poor, Unfaltering friendship, loyal loveâ Joys your greatest sigh to prove. O come to us! At break of day We'll breast the billows of the bay; Then range afar with rod or gun, Sportsmen keen, till set of sun. Or our advent'rous nymphs beside With eager oarage take the tide To mountains fresh and forests new, Borne along the Atlantic blue. Pausing awhile, our quest achieved, On velvet mosses over-leaved With shelter from the solar glare Gipsy-wise our feast to share. O thenâor when a moonlit main Together tempts us home again, And dipping dreamy oars we go, Softly singing, laughing lowâ Then most of allâbeware! beware! The starry eyes, the night of hairâ Each darkling grace of face and mould, Silver voices, hearts of gold. So come to us and gladly ownâ Unless your heart's as hard as stoneâ That not one kingdom in the sphere With our Kerry can compare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOODS AND MELODIES. PARKNASILLA. TO AN ARTIST. O who could limn the landscape that we loveâ The rocky garden's variegated wreathâ The limes that skirtâthe oaks and pines beneathâ Ocean before, the summer sky above? Who could pourtray the mountains' purple smilesâ And all the opal hues of earth and heaven, Foam-fringing forestsâheather-tufted Isles; The roseate dawnâpurpureal pomps of evenâ And young Atlantic's petulant shifting wiles? Who could do aught but mar the true expression Where all is change? Then why a record shape Of scenes whose nature glories in succession From wood to waveâfrom wave to distant capeâ Like the young poet's dream, fair beyond all possession? SHE LEANT UPON THE RUSTIC BRIDGE. She leant upon the Rustic Bridge, With all her spirit in her eyes, Far off the mountains, ridge on ridge, Flowed westward through the autumn skies. The blue sea kissed its golden weeds,â In wreaths the blue smoke took the airâ Flushed were the forestsâgreen the meadsâ She said, âThis earth is passing fair.â THE FIRST ROSE. A MELODY. The rose that in the springtide ventures forth To woo the Zephyr, with her crimson smiles And odorous wiles, Too often chances on the cruel North; For every kiss of his cold lips, With poisonous blight her beauty nips. Till one by one with downcast head She weeps away her petals red, And with the last, bereft of life and light Sighs forth her passionate soul on the dark lap of night. THE FADED ROSE. Throw the window open wider; let the cool air kiss my brows; See, the stars alone are shining; hark! the rustling of the boughs; On a night, oh, how how like this, love, we breathed our virgin vows! And the dear old arbour, shall I never never see it more? With its pleasant rustic seats, and scaly cones, and pebbled floor, And the rose that peeped upon us, dearest, through the open door. âYield, outrivalled, yield this forfeit, rash one, to a Rose more fair;â Light he laughed and turning twined its brightest blossom in my hair. Love, unclasp this cherished locket; see, the withered flower is there! Little, thought I, when I set it fondly in this shrine of gold, That thy Rose would fade as fast, her cheek as soon turn wan and cold. Take her in thy precious arms, and let her die within their fold. âIRISH EYES.â Irish Eyes! Irish Eyes, Eyes that most of all can move me! Lift one look From my book, Through your lashes dark, and prove me In my worship O how wise! Other orbs, be content! In your honor, not dispraisalâ Most I prize, Irish Eyes Since were not your ebon, hazel, Violetâall to light them lent? Then no mischief, Merry Eyes! Stars of Thought, no jealous fancies! Can I err To prefer This sweet union of your glances, Sparkling, darkling Irish Eyes? SLEEPLESS. A SONNET. Pale Queen, that from thy bower Elysian, In slow, sweet state supremely issuing forth, Of thy dear pity to the day-worn man, Dispensest dreams through all the darkened earth, Hast thou no ray of softliest-silvered span, To tempt coy Slumber hither? O, if thou hast, By all the love of thy Endymion, Spare it, that I, even I, may rest at last. Yea! that for me, sad Present, cruel Past, Dark Future blend in blest oblivion, Speed Slumber, Slumber to these aching eyes, That he with wings of balmiest breath may fan My cares to rest, confuse each haunting plan, And steal my spirit with a sweet surprise. AN IRISH GRACE. For beauty's blaze Let Pagans praise The features of Aglaia, Admire agape The maiden shape Consummate in Thalia, Last hail in thee, Euphrosyne, Allied the sovran powers Of form and faceâ No heathen Grace Can match this Grace of ours. Blue are her eyes, as though the skies Were ever blue above them, And dark their full-fringed canopies, As if the night fays wove them. Two roses kiss to mould her mouth, Her ear's a lily blossom, Her blush a sunset in the south, And drifted snow her bosom. Her voice is gay, but soft and low, The sweetest of all trebles, A silver brook that, in its flow, Chimes over pearly pebbles. A happy heart, a temper bright, Her radiant smile expresses; And, like a wealth of golden light, Rain down her sunny tresses. Earth's desert clime, Whose sands are Time, Will prove a glad oasis, If 'tis my fate, My friends, to mate With such a girl as Grace is. SAD THRUSH. O thrush, that pourest far and near, From some dark bower thy passionate song, Thou speakest sadder to my ear To-day than all the feathered throng. For when, alas! in search of food The mother bird had left her young, With axe in hand, a woodsman rude, I roved my leafy shades among; Till, cruel chance! my critic eye Discerned a wildering beechen bough; I heaved the sturdy steel on high, And with three strokes I struck it through. It trembled, tottered, crashed, and fell, And turning, tossed upon the air Four throstles, scarce escaped the shell, With downy breasts and pinions bare; Whilst wildly wheeling o'er their fall, Returned, alas! one moment late, The parent thrush, with piteous call, Bewailed her children's cruel fate. Each bird, with wafts of warmest breath, I strove to stir to life again; But oh! so rude the rock beneathâ All, all the little ones were slain. In their own nest, that scarce was cold, Their tender corses I inurned; Then made their grave of garden mould, And homeward melancholy turned. And this is why in cadence clear, Pouring afar her passionate song, One thrush speaks sadder to my ear To-day than all the feathered throng. GLAD THRUSH. Hush! O hush! For the yellow-throated thrush Comes winging fleetlyâ Whither? Hither, The yellow-throated, mellow-noted thrush Comes winging fleetly. Singing, how sweetly, âKwee-kwee kwee-kwee, Trill-lilla-la.â Then hush! O hush! My pipe of holly Most melancholy; For our sad song Would greatly wrong His carol jolly; âKwee-kwee kwee-kwee, Trill-lilla-la.â He, perching thus, Pipes back to us,â âLight-hearted swain, Thy jocund flute To-day is mute. O why refrain Its mirthful strain To pour; when I From this tree nigh, Am piping plain, âKwee-kwee kwee-kwee, Trill-lilla-la?ââ And I reply, âSweet bird, because Grief only was In my flute's sigh, Till you came by; But your kwee-kwee Of gushing glee, Bids sorrow fly. So, overhead, Sing on kwee-kwee, Trill-lilla-la, Till day is dead.â THE HUNTER BRAVE. âSo kiss farewell,â the hunter cries, And forth upon his courser flies. âFarewell!â his wife and children wave âFarewell! farewell! our hunter brave.â Beware the lion's deadly leapâ A flashâa fallâa heaving heapâ And, lo! the monster in his cave Lies dead before the hunter brave. âTo horseâto horse!â again he cries, And homeward, homeward, homeward flies. Whilst âwelcome!â wife and children wave, âWelcome, once more, our hunter brave!â IRISH LULLABY. Id rock my own sweet childie to rest in a cradle of gold on a bough of the willow, To the shosheen ho; of the wind of the west and the shularoo of the soft sea billow. Sleep, baby dear, Sleep without fear, Mother is here beside your pillow. I'd put my own sweet childie to sleep in a silver boat on the beautiful river, Where a shosheen whisper the white cascades, and a shularoo the green flags shiver. Sleep, baby dear, Sleep without fear, Mother is here with you for ever. Shularoo! to the rise and fall of mother's bosom 'tis sleep has bound you, And O, my child, what cozier nest for rosier rest could love have found you? Sleep, baby dear, Sleep without fear, Mother's two arms are clasped around you. MIGHT LOVING MAIDS. IRISH MELODY. Might loving maids confess Their bosoms' dear distress, To youths as fond-avowed could they but speak, The words of my adieu Had not been light and few; The smile had turned to tears upon my cheek. O yes! might maidens tell With their last wild farewell, How truest hearts oft ache unclaimed behind, I who so dearly loved Had not seemed all unmoved Toward theeâmy own true love confessed were fortune kind. Yet though perforce we part, Ere faithful heart to heart Could own the tender rapture each inspired, Absence will but approve The honour of thy love, And make my hope the more to be desired. Yes! though perforce we part, Ere faithful heart to heart Could own the tender rapture each inspired, Absence will but approve The honour of thy love, And make my hope in thee the more to be desired. WHEN SHE ANSWERED ME HER VOICE WAS LOW. IRISH MELODY. When she answered me her voice was lowâbut, oh! Not, Erin, thine own harp's impassioned chord With prouder bliss e'er bade my bosom glow, Than she has kindled by that one sweet word. When the colleen's eyes looked back the love in mine, My Erin, never after darkest night With bluer welcome o'er the ocean line Thy shore has started on my patriot sight. And, Erin, bid thy son as soon believe Thy song expired, thy star of promise set, As dream my darling's eyes could e'er deceive, Her lips their low sweet answer all forget. AUTUMN DIRGE. Fallen with the fallen leaf! All the woods are bowed with grief, And the sky, without relief, O'er the earth with tears replieth. We are also bowed with grief, And from tears have no relief: Death is on our aged chief; Dumb and motionless he lieth. Now the earth all beauty scorning, With no blooms her breast adorning, Wrapped in cypress robes is mourning For the summer's lost delight; Thus, no coloured garb adorning, We are clad in darkest mourning;â Swift of Stroke and Wise of Warning, Thou hast robbed our limbs of light. SONG. Life like ours is April weather; Tears and smiles, smiles and tears, Sighs and laughter linked together; Fears and hopes, hopes and fears, Storm and sunshine, hither, thither, Shifting through the spheres. Love alluring, harming, healing; Bliss his Yes! Woe his No! Fortune's smile and frown revealing Foe in friend, friend in foe; Mirth to-day, to-morrow Sorrow Guiding as we go.</field>
