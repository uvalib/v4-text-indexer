      <field name="fulltext">“Caelum ipsum petimus stultitia”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADÔNIS AND APHRODÎTÊ. See Titian's picture in the National Gallery. I Ah, Aphrodîtê, godlike was thy pride When Arês crowned thee victor,—when the choice Of Ida's shepherd let the apple glide In thy fair hands curled cuplike,—when the voice That shook Olumpos took a silver tone, Fearful lest sudden tears should stain the face It chided trembling; and when Psuchê bowed To thee her subject beauty and made moan,— Meek to the peerless mother,—thou wert proud. II Yea, and as goddess thou hast oft grown pale With love's dread languishment. The kingly sire Of Ilium's foster-hope, whom thou didst quail With quivering lightning, wrought in thee the tire Of stifled passion. Thou didst yearn for him And many a rose-lipped mortal. Love's sweet sigh That sorrow touches touched thee sorrowingly, And the deep aureate hair grew golden dim, The blue-flower eyes drooped sunless: maidens die Of that which is a smile's death unto thee. III But never wert thou woman until now, Suppliant, caressing, tremulous, and wild At thine own impotence to win the brow Of thy free hunter-boy, to thee, the child That from the chase restrains.—Adônis, haste From the fair arms that belt thee; for blue eyes, Blue radiant eyes, sun-lifted tearfully, And a white bosom ruffled, wilt thou waste The glorious manhood maidens tendril-wise Creep to as vines;—for which she crept to thee? IV But thou, Bright Grace, defied and spelless, torn By mortal pangs, to inmost godhead slain From quiver thou wert wont to fill, what scorn Shall make a fair corpse of thy living pain, And shroud it as for burial? Be bold To hide the haughty shame that ages thee, To close with tomblike lips the sobbing breath; Make marble the pale cheek; imperially Bear the dread sickness and the shuddering cold— All those immortal limbs can learn of death. THE SONG OF APHRODÎTÊ. I In his first bright slumber I paused beside him, My bosom heaved over him in his sleep, And longing to kiss him, to clasp and keep, I said in my pride, “Let the dark queen hide him, Let her keep him safe from the heart he will slay.” But still in my bosom the sweet child lay; I felt my glad arms round his warm limbs close In sleep that to happy dream entices; And his breath came sweet as the clove-pink spices To the languorous rose. II To the dark Queen of Hades repentant I hasted; The boy was rained o'er by her fast-raining tears; His rich beauty lay, a dropt flower from the years Of her girlhood amid the gay fields, ere she wasted In the dark world Aïd?neus swayed. “As the bloom Of the bright poppied path where I found my dread doom Glows the radiant child thou hast bidden me nurse. I am motherless now, and he makes me a mother; Oh, take, if you take him from me, to another Persephonê's curse.” III I sought the Great Father; his suppliant ever He listens benignant, benignantly calms, And I bade him unprison the boy from the arms That held him in darkness: “Adônis will never Be thine, save in passion of joy half-possest: Four months in the mid underworld must he rest; Four months, if it list him, his golden-tressed hair Shall lie on the pillow thy heart-throb makes heaving; Four months he shall be the lone hunter, love-leaving For wild forest lair.” IV As a pale flower filmed by the darkness that faded, Looked the wan cheek, dead with the dead world's hush; But with summer of kisses I brought the blush; Then soft from the luminous roses I shaded My o'er-dazzled eyes, he in turn would desire; And their sapphire-deep dream of the dropt lids require With the tremulous claim of his lips' wooing breath, Till I lifted them laughing, and bade him forsake me For forest and freedom. He sware, “None shall take me Save she who tends Death.” V Yet sometimes he broke from the gladness that girt him, For he loved the wild chase, and I could not restrain, Who trembled lest Artemis, angered, should hurt him. Too cold for his beauty, too proud for my pain, One shaft in her scorn she let loose; and he swooned; I left the white lips, to drink deep of the wound, Cold to cold, corpse to corpse, with my dead love to lie: The doom with the deathless ones lonely to languish Brought something like age to my heart; but, oh anguish, The gods love, nor die! VI “Dost thou cry for the bitter-sweet lot of a mortal, Who heavest the heart-sigh with heavenly breath? Go, drink, thou divine one, the deep springs of death; Let thy broken desire faint by Hadês' dark portal,” So doomed the dread Father, “and thou wilt learn all:— Death is but a loss for renewal, a call To a love beyond answer; the broad sun doth set The earth for a while of his bright beams bereaving, Athwart the thick darkness, past cleft and past cleaving, The dawn to beget. VII “A mourner can learn all that death has for telling; Through dark days of winter thy love shall lie dead, Then wake with the May-breeze his bright queen to wed, And, till the grapes' purple and pomegranates' swelling, Shall love as they only can love who must part. Be helpless, be hopeful; the fluttering heart The child of my thunder-bound brows may despise; To thee, by the tremulous lip, the eyes' tender Blue dimness of tears, I Love's kingdom surrender, A kingdom of sighs. VIII “The track of the cistus Adônis shall borrow, When thine own lily blooms thou shalt see him return; Thy tears in anemone clusters shall burn, The purple for passion, the pale for the sorrow. The cyclamen fields shall be fair for his tread, The daphne bloom fragrant to bower round his head; Watch wistful the curve of the crocus' sheen gold In aureate wreath round the mountain-snow creeping, So round thine Adônis still white from death-sleeping Thy bright arms shall fold.” IX So I sing of him, sing of him, sigh for him, sicken,— The swan at my passionate plaint leaves her nest; So I clasp my soft doves to my sore-craving breast, And breathe on the dull myrtle-buds till they quicken, For 'mid their white blossoms once more I am bride! And, rich in love-pity, to ransom from pride The bosom love sways not, the hero to arm, As sad for my tarrying lover I linger, For joy of his beauty, I weave with bright finger The cestus of charm. THE SONG OF HÊRÔ. “Quid juvenis, magnum cui versat in ossibus ignem Durus amor?” Georgics, lib. iii. 258. I I wait my love; for me he travels this waste of water, His love nor the dark, nor the sea, nor the sea-wind bars; But to-night he swims fast through the golden stream, The glittering path of the mid moonbeam; And limbs as white in their lustrous snow As the snow-white limbs of fair Lêda's daughter, Dyed deep in the current's girding glow, Will leap from the waves as from tangled stars. II I wait my lover in pride; to them great glory was given, Whom Zeus wooed in golden rain, or wrapped in his flaming breath, But Dan?? shut in her brazen wall, Or Semêlê scorched by the lightning's fall, Ne'er dreamed a rapture, or dared a gain, Like mine, when, the prisoning waters riven, He drinks the kisses for which full fain He faces death, and the rear of death. III I wait my lover; deep curves through the golden ripples he raises, The moon glows clear on the marble,—Selênê's wake; On the sacred pathway why will he press, That the chaste maid loves in her loneliness? The ocean, hid in forest of night, Secure for her feet as the woodland mazes She dreamed, and made, for her own delight, Sweet tracks that no lover should dare to take. IV And yet with glimpse of Leiandros the vision may smite her Of one she slew with her shaft on the ocean verge. She loved bright Orîon, she loved his song, As the lonely and silent love, with strong Life-shattering passion; his sister's fall Roused the Delian's wrath: let her aim aright her Keen shaft where the sea was flawed; then call The bard she had buried beneath the surge. V And yet did the fair huntress fall, or but alter in fashion, When her pierced breast taught her the pain of her quiver's dart? Can she guard the flock, or the maiden throng Who through youth immortal hath ne'er been young? Nay, pure through noble pain she can heal, Cleansed from lifeless pride by a sacred passion; Grand foster-mother of human weal, She girds, and chastens, and curbs the heart! VI But pure to her height, my lover, what hero so perfect hearted? Lo, a king left his sweet girl-guide to wake to her death, And a prince for a little while found bliss, Ere he craved the false bride, in Oinônê's kiss. But the dye of thy faith prints deep the years Of enrounding time; thy cheek since we parted Hath been touched alone by impatient tears, And only glows with my greeting breath. VII The gods have stooped to be mortal for love of a mortal maiden, But godlike thou in thy manhood, majestic in might; By no fragrant curls, by no flashing sign, Couldst thou grow to my spirit more divine: For thee there is neither death, nor doom, For thy heart with the life of love is laden; From the deep, from the darkness, a double tomb, I take thee to worship, and warmth, and light. VIII My great queen guards thee, full fond is her thought of the quivering water, That rounded her bosom, that dimpled for sweet desire The eddies in cheek and chin, with dip Of steadier curve for the subtle lip And drooping lids; clear the cradle bays, And the paths through which to her longing daughter She leads Leiandros, that lover's praise May flush her pure altar with flowers and fire. THE HALCYONS. “And birds of calm sat brooding o'er the charmèd wave.” I The storm-wind has heaped cruel snow on the breaker, That sweeps in dread folds the white dead to the shore; The hoar sea-blast no longer can wake her, Who waited the dead she waits no more.— A refluent wave round her bosom whitened, A wave from the sea brought his cold corpse back; With meeting of love bitter death-waves have brightened Their wild track. II Dead love to love;—they may not be parted, The chill, pressing waves have no power to part; And even the whirlwind, careless-hearted, Feels, as it passes, the throb of a heart. Death with a ring of wild surf has wed them; Dead lips to lips they have kissed in Death's sleep; The scattered foam-flowers and the billows that shed them Fade and weep. III The deep cold sky is rayed with the dawning; The stars unchain their orbs from the night; Like a dark flower fading, unloved of morning, The darkness scatters its leaves in the light. And white day broods on the white of ocean, As the sea-bird broods on the ocean-breast, And the winds lay the waves with a lulling motion To their rest. IV Autumn stays her hands in their woodland reaving, The cornlands stir not one brown-ripe stem; While sleep's pale hand, still-fingered, is weaving In the day's loose hair, night's anadem. Her eyes take its rippling life from the river, Her hand stills the plains of the heaving grass; Through the air's deep calm the slight sunbeam-quiver Dare not pass. V Sleep lays her touch on the curling billow, And smooths down its curves to a cradle-bed; The love that sought love on the ocean-pillow Can know no death, though white as the dead. —Two fair birds rock on the waves together, As close as the rocking blue can bring; And the waters lift not one soft light feather From their wing. VI They sprang from their sad cold death, with the springing Of pale sweet dawn from the chill fair foam; And the sea round their strange new life is clinging,— The ocean must be their new love's home. And in winter the waves to rest are charmèd, The halycon's brood is their bosom's care; While the wind and tempest by sleep are calmèd Everywhere. THE SONG OF THE HÊLIADAI. I The sun's mighty horses are idle, Fire-nostrilled and lightning-maned; They champ for the mastering bridle By which their fierce beauty is reined, And their splendid power to a god's power chained— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! II Their great golden wings are beaten Against the prisoning walls, And their fiery food is uneaten In the cloud-scooped laden stalls; Round their bright chafed feet scorn-trampled it falls.— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! III From their nostrils red streaks are beaming, Meteor-like and intense, While their lustrous flanks are gleaming, And they pant with breathings dense For the blue steep wastelands free of fence.— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! IV Burnished hoofs, fire-edged, ears uplifted, They hear the chariot's sound; The chariot, like oak-leaves drifted, Is fulvid;—when they are bound With blood-gold darkness it shades the ground!— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! V Wherefore tremble the haughty creatures, And roll their blue eye-balls wild? They see not the god's ruling features, But his lovely mortal child, Crownless, uncurbing, by pride beguiled.— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! VI To the turmoil of wheels echoes waken, Sanguine glow the sky-tracts clear, For the slight hand the reins hath taken, And the restive chargers rear; Their heads feel the strain of human fear.— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! VII Then the deathless coursers fly, crashing The clouds on their ruinous way, Through hail and rent tempest dashing; The heaven itself is their prey.— Oh, dreadful, doomful, pitiless day! Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! VIII The sky is lashed by their scathing fire, The mountains are molten heaps, The land is one blackened funeral pyre, The wind as the typhoon sweeps; Yet the struggling form its wild grasp keeps.— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! IX Then the pressed purple cloud is riven By the lightning's archery; The bolt towards the boy is driven, He falls; and the steeds are free Through the stroke of Immortality!— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! X He falls, and the great-breasted ocean Whelms his scorched limbs 'neath the wave, And softly, with mother-like motion, She heaps with white foam his grave: No prayer can win him, no pleading save.— Weep with me, daughters of Hêlios! XI Though he failed in his high endeavour, He thought great thoughts, and his name Shall nor die, nor be buried ever, Nor blasted by scornful blame; A god alone could the sun-steeds tame.— Sing with me, daughters of Hêlios! ERÔS AND PSUCHÊ. I. The Wonder. He comes to me—a bliss without a name. Like a blind flower in the bright sun I bask Till the warm mystery fills my inmost frame. Till I am mirrored sunlight, and the mask Of this fair body for a while doth seem Mastered by some diviner self. To ask For open vision of the heavenly dream, For sight of this wild gladness at my heart, For glory of the eyes whose violet beam Burns in my soul's hid treasuries, were to part From secrets that are gifts. Oh, had I missed The darksome wonder, had I dared to start, When, trembling, from the rubied lips that kissed, I learnt the glowing eyes' deep amethyst! But mine I hid, of the great flame afraid That breathed on me, as of the lightning's fire, When its keen radiance round my bosom played. Sweeter that moment of illumed desire, That broidered darkness, that love-limnèd guess, Than were thy brow's clear majesty to tire My memory with its fixèd loveliness. Now the winged Iris in her transient grace Gives me the fleeting image to express The aye-illuding charm, the godlike face, Dimly divined through dreams that grow more fair; While down of dovelike plumes meseems I trace When my arms ply with amorous touch the air For the rich freight that darkling it will bear. II. The Unrest. Sweet, I must see thee, for the dream doth fade, My morning dream of thy lost loveliness, When in mine arms thy living beauty laid, Pricks my keen sense more passionate to guess How glows the jewel sheathing night doth hide.— Are the curls gold my wandering fingers press? Do the smiles break in dimples when I chide Caressingly, and with soft touch entreat? Thou hast enriched me with thy voice to guide My spirit to the gaze, divinely sweet, Where Love's mute lyre makes music.—Pityingly, Dreading a rapture for my soul unmeet, Dost thou the bliss of thy great boon deny? Nay, I must gaze in worship, or I die! III. The Watching. I stand beside thee, tremblingly upborne The lamp that pales before thy lustrous brow, Like moonbeams blanching in the fervid morn. Nay, thine own beauty as in awe doth bow, Quelled by the majesty of slumbering might Sovereign within thee. Shouldst thou waken now Thou wouldst not need to slay me; for the light Of those consuming eyes would be my doom; Yet my hot tears, down-raining for delight Of thee, thy perfect body, bowered in bloom Of the closed pinion's tender coverlet, Will surely stir thee.—O my heart, make room For great desires! He doth not chide thee yet; In its sweet guerdon thy vast sin forget. Fairer than seemed Endymiôn in his sleep, When Cynthia through his slumbers shot desire, Thou seemest; her sweet state she could not keep, Lured to her shepherd boy.—Love lights the pyre Of pride, then leaps to heaven; yea, at sight Of simple girlhood, Erôs feels the fire That frees him, captive to the prisoning white Of Aphrodîtê's arms. Imperial child,— Peerless among the immortals!—for delight Didst thou seek Psuchê's bosom? Could the wild Young wings so close? And have I cradled thee Who art the great gods' conqueror? Defiled By the pure past's reproach, I wait to see Thy trustful eyes wake to my treachery. Not by thy mother's myrtle in the hair, Not by the apple's scent, or lily's shine Round opal temples, nor by wings that wear Eôs' faint saffron tinct, do I divine Thine awful majesty; it brands its name In my revealèd sin. I am not thine But for thy vengeance, that my very shame May give proud pleasure to thy wrath; to feel All thou wouldst have me suffer, bear the blame Of lips, whose hurt no other praise can heal, Is the one hope of my poor loyalty. Torture me, and my patience shall reveal How my dross-mingled gold is thine to try Till the fire slake. I will not ask to die. IV. The Awakening. He stirred.—I stooped to kiss him as he lay, To bid farewell, lest I should find him fled, Hurled by a spurning ire, ere I could pray That he would pour his anger on my head. So stooping, dizzy with great love's restraint, The lamp shook in my loosened hand, and shed One drop on the bright shoulder. I grew faint As the swift lids unfolded, and the clear Sweet eyes looked straight at my soul's hidden taint, Then slowly darkened; yet I could not moan, Awed by the still face, withering in the blast Of a great hope's extinction. “Thou hast shown “To me a woman's frailty, thou who hast Strength for immortal spousals.” So he passed. V. The Trial. If he had cursed me, I had lived to drink Even to the dregs my bitter punishment; Being deserted merely, to the brink Of the sweet river's cooling waves I went To bathe my heavy eyes, and soothe the cheek Fresh tears were ever staining. Then I leant Over the rippling stream, and let it streak My drooping hair, and round my bosom close. “If I should drown myself, he would not seek Even my corpse for burial.” I uprose And leapt in the mid current, proud to gain The pitiless oblivion he chose For my poor memory, in his god's disdain Of the slight heart he coveted in vain. But me the heaving water safely bore, As some strong arm were pillow to my head; Nor loosed its chafing waves, till, on the shore, As softly o'er the golden sand they spread, The creeping ripples laid me; and a dim Gladness came o'er me that I was not dead, Being still beloved. And from the river's brim Meseemed I tracked a rugged path, until It broke among the jutting crags that rim The far-uplifted azure. I lay still, Counting the steps to the lone summit gray I felt my feet must traverse to fulfil Love's bidding; then I faced the stony way As pardoned, being prompted to obey. VI. The Dream. On the chill mountain-side I lay and wept; (Oh bitter in the dark to weep alone!) And to escape my loneliness I slept. Might I not dream the golden wings were thrown Around me? Not illusive was the thrill Of hope; he came to me, as erst, unknown, A Presence, not a Vision. I lay still And quieted my heart, lest it should crave, Should beat in quick rebellion to the will I would make wholly mine. “Thou must be slave To Aphrodîtê; till thy beauty flit, Till thou art marred and humbled, from the wave Thou must draw water for her. I have lit The insufferable wrath with foolish fame Of thy rare beauty, and she dreams thee smit With pride of rivalry, now thou canst name Erôs, thine hid delight. With daylight thou Wilt scan her palace; hie thee to thy shame; Suffer the scorn ineffable. Not now Forbidden, to the scathing lustre bow.” VII. The Bondage. I am her slave, and in the noontide heat Must bear bright water from the spring that brims Her shadeless fountains; and the doom is sweet! Still through my weariness the vision swims Of that unutterable grace—the hair That sweeps the massive glory of her limbs Goldening their soft-veined marble; cheeks that wear Pink of the oleander, when it glows Athwart the snows of Pindos; and more fair Than the white doves, that in its soft warmth close Their wings and nestle, is the glancing breast Where the Bright Child was pillowed, ere he chose To kindle my girl-passion, and give rest To the desire he quickened. Sweet, more blest Is Psuchê, longing, desolate, denied, And loving on simply in love's sweet name, Than in her untried loyalty, her pride, Self-thought, and restless wonder. With the same Fond tendrils of desire my spirit clings To thy unseen divineness; yet no claims Urges, craves no requital, simply flings Herself in prone submission to the will Her goal of worship. Proudest pleasure springs From the mute trust that calls her to fulfil Command inexplicable, suffer blight Of labour, pain, and loneliness, and still Find that the only task beyond her might Were not to worship with a free delight. VIII. The Redemption. Was it but yesterday that I drew near The shadeless fount, then paused a little space To pierce its sunlit depths? The well was clear, And mirrored in its surface was the face My tears remembered, with the smile that he Ne'er gave me for remembrance. To embrace That softened reflex I stooped tremblingly, Kissing the stream, and ever downward drew In awe of the Great Presence that must be Guardian to that pale image. But he threw Round me his wings' warm darkness, and in shade Of those dove-feathered plumes, the voice I knew Stole softly. “Sweet, thy tender trust hath made Thee for my love immortal. I have prayed “The inexorable Mother. She, who first Urged me thy lovely maidenhood to wrong, Finding me amorous of the thing she cursed, “Closed her for-ever-parting lips, in strong Purpose full vengeance on my head to wreak; But I, immortal from her bosom, young “And careless of her anger, sought the cheek Of fresher flower than Hêbê's. Ah, how sweet The child-like trust and wonder, and the weak “Childish caprice how pitiful! Unmeet For my great love, I mourned thee as the dead Are mourned; then she I trembled to entreat “Yet fled to, parted her proud lips, and said, ‘Psuchê must be my bondmaid, ere she wed “‘The boy forgetful that he is my son. Leave her to me, through toil and punishment Slowly to teach her the dishonour done “‘Unto thy love, my beauty; till, content With harshest usage, she shall only ask For thee in memories; and in soul be bent “‘To serve my awful queenliness in task The slave is born to.’ Sweetest bondmaid, thou Art free. Bright Aphrodîtê bids thee bask “In love's mid blisses; thou canst bear them now.” Slowly I felt the glorious wings divide; Faced the full smile, the lustres of the brow, The amethystine fire; then to his side I sprang, his peer and his immortal bride. APOLLO'S WRITTEN GRIEF. “? The blue bells Of Hyacinth tell Apollo's written grief.” Prometheus Unbound, Act ii. Scene I. I Is it what men call darkness that is heaving On me its blinding surge? Darkness is lack Of all I am,—how should I know its track, Who leave it rearward as the swift keels cleaving The sea-lands leave behind the severing mark? Is it what men call death,—that deeper dark Enwombing earth's frail offspring, that defies, Faces, and thralls me? Are these tears that rain Hot torturing dews upon a cheek from stain As clear, as from the deluge-bearing skies Scorched Afric's golden plain? II Yea, they are tears, hot tears that love hath taught me, Tears passionate as Cytherea's breath, And I, like her, for dead love's sake, with Death Will strive; the pale narcissus he hath brought me Weave in a crown, and his fell kingdom claim; And it shall be my wrong this bitter shame Wrought on the rosy sculpture of the gods Bright manhood's marbled limbs,—wrought on the face Olumpos matched not.—Thou fair fallen Grace, Say, what of thee amid the crumbling clods Still pines for my embrace? III Frail aureate opening flower, thou liest faded! Men dream that thou wert smitten by the glow Of my too perilous love, not by the blow Of him who rivalled me, and oft upbraided The fair boy only proud when I caressed; My Hyakinthos of the ivory breast, Meet offering for the sun-god the white shrine Of thy young spirit panting for the light! My worshipper, my lover, not too bright Seemed I to thee; thou sufferedst the divine, Daring the dread delight. IV Can none recover thee? Father of healing Was my wise child, and wellnigh conquered Fate, Till Zeus, in fear of hell depopulate, Murdered my boy, and bade me, ill concealing My rebel rage, in servitude fulfil Seven years, till I could bow me to the will Of him who watched stark Moira's weaving thread Awful, and trembled at man's impious hand:— Yea, death must be, death and the shadow-land, For mortals; unassuagèd, by my dead, I, an immortal, stand. V More to me than my son, or bond-slave brother, Great Heraklês, who as the swelling vine Ripened to godhead; meet for love divine! Well was it I beheld thee and no other, On thee heaven's mightiest had swooped in greed, Thou lovely boy, thou bright-cheeked Ganymede, Had he beheld thee; but thou wert mine own, Nor did thy young faith falter from its clear And passionate devotion. Thy Great Seer Sovereigned thy life, and thou didst need alone That he should hold thee dear. VI I have been with my worshippers, and often, When with gay pieties the air was blithe, With the sweet clustered girls, clear-voiced and lithe, Mingling unseen, have felt my spirit soften: When from their weary lips the paian fell, The music of their motions kept the swell And rhythmic rise of high choralic seas; And the soothed ear was of rich sound bereft As rose of rose-leaves, when her heart is cleft By gentlest gale; and on the feathered breeze The rosy scent is left. VII Amid the gleaming, lovely group I lingered, Yearning to make the graces sybilline, Yearning in maiden stronghold to enshrine My deep prophetic life; and deftly fingered Their fallen lutes;—with Syrinx for his reed Pan breathed not more melodious pain, a need More piteous,—yet I found not one of these Whose spirit I could mould, a cup to fill With my majestic joys, or who could still Cravings that only utmost faith can ease, Of meek surrendered will. VIII Wooer of mortal girlhood, none would wed me, Yea, by a goddess I have been denied. Veiled Hestia, when I spake of love, replied By the great virgin oath; frail Daphnê fled me; The false Korônis to avenging flame I gave; her pyre waxed pale beside the shame Of her, my sacred godhead's sole desire, Who passioned me to bride her with the wild Fire of my burning lips;—recreant, reviled, Mourned still in secret pulses of my lyre, Lost Ilium's museful child. IX I saw her first, laid in my shrine for sleeping, The arched lids open in divinest dream, With cheek swept by bright flushes, as the theme Ruffled her pulses! Subtle serpents creeping Probed the ears' portals; as their sapient guile Traversed her spirit's inner haunts, a smile Owned my gift's potency; so strangely kissed Procnê's thrill-noted pang, the ecstasy Of jubilant cicalas, even the sigh Of tremulous low grasses she could list, Silence' most dainty cry! X So grew she wise through years of happy listening, Still-lipped, and loving, and serenely gay, And once again in womanhood she lay Athwart my temple-steps; the noon was glistening, But like a flower she drank the light; her vest Left bare the pure young limbs, the brighter breast Than my swans' plumes at sun-kiss, and the glow Of the grand, restful arms—one drawn to serve As pillow; arching with superber swerve One, backward flung, fell o'er the hair, and low Drooped to the finger-curve. XI My priestess! not like Pythia when I tore her With devastating blast, and left her dead, Warm from my lips the breeze prophetic spread, Warm from my wooing lips it stole to store her With the wide world's futurity: she woke; Slowly the blue eyes opened, and there broke 'Thwart the great globing iris' thunder fire, Immitigable splendours! Quivering light Leapt from the spirit's sluices, till its might Swelled, like the gathering music of the lyre To the full paian's height. XII Meek as a mortal suppliant I besought her, Gave her sweet vows, and made myself a child, Lest the frail-fashioned girl should swoon 'neath wild Ardours of burning godhead, and I brought her To bow her burdened spirit to my will In absolute surrender; to fulfil My bidding, as a wavering ship her helm. On my restraining strength her heart she stayed: A nation's doom on her young lips I laid; But I had given her soul too vast a realm,— She trembled, disobeyed. XIII Then how I mocked and mightily derided, And vexed her ears with a world's maniac scorn, Leaving her wise, prophetic, and forlorn, Still to make plain the path and none be guided, To warn her Ilium till its walls should ring With groaning of the brazen horse, to cling To cold Athênê, ravished from her feet By impious Oileus; then to satisfy Atreides' lust, goad Klutaimnêstra, cry On the foul stench of blood; and last—oh, sweet!— Sing her own dirge, and die. XIV I as an athlete mightily have broken All wrestling will, and given worse than blows To all who traitored their high selves; when rose Oriôn from the wave, with lover's token Flushing the white thoughts of high Artemis, I swore the floating thing her shaft would miss And roused her to unerring aim. Beneath My feet I trampled all infirming power, Sickness, and hampering pain! Nurse-fed an hour Childhood's soft swathes I burst, as from its sheath Bursts the exultant flower! XV If aught rose emulously fair I slew it; When Lêtô passioned that her twain should be Peered with the clustered wealth of Niobê, Straightway I swore the impious one should rue it And bent my bow; no arrow sped in vain! With satiate wrath by the fair heap of slain I paused; they were a lovely wreath of dead;— Sweet-bosomed girls, and boys of snowy limb, Still as the dawnlight, in the dawnlight dim, While o'er their ruined forms her sorrow spread As streams that overbrim. XVI Did I not sway all heaven with my lyreing, And set high sunlight on the Father's brow? Harmonia smiled; Arês, forgetful how His white queen fondled him with love-desiring, Glowed in the mighty music; Hêrê's pride Flashed not from the great softened orbs; with wide Rose-lips child Hêbê listened; the clear eyes Of dread Athênê kept their dawn, then slow The plumed helm o'er the aigis drooped; and lo, Me, a mere Breath, a wanton boy defies, Dealing the guileful blow! XVII Weak-armed and envious dare he so dissemble, Speeding my quoit with an impetuous breeze? Did I not use him serf-wise, over-seas To sweep, his swift subservient wings a-tremble, The men I plucked from Pylos to my shrine? Driven by his pressing plumes to be divine Priests peopled my Parnassian clefts, the bleat Rose of ungrazing flocks. This violet stain Dims a world's worship; and it were but vain, For my lost love, he was so mortal sweet, A god's fair life to gain. XVIII Lost! and I lost him, I, Divine Defender Of my most sacred things, whose wrath one day Persia's wide host in impotence shall lay By my unguarded shrine. Priests shall surrender My fame, give room for victory to be won In the stilled laurels, 'neath the blazing sun, My ungripped weapons on the temple-stair, Within, the throne of Midas, Kroisos' bowl, The glittering lion; ere the thunder roll Silence shall muster fearfully,—the air Leashed to my vengeful soul. XIX Then, as the ravening hand is stretched for gaining Of my fair gifts, rises the sudden shock Of winds, loosed forests, my rent Delphian rock Dumbing the thunder-roar with chasm-straining, Ere it can hurl its cloven crests as snow On the pale host. No Persian bends his bow; But all as sacrificial sheep shall die Quivering and quiet. Then an evening breeze Shall clear the heavens and sway the laurel trees To swell through murmuring grove the lyric cry Of choral minstrelsies. XX Nay, but mine ears are by the praise upbraided Of Delphian throng faming my guardian might; For him I shielded not, my sole Delight, His dimmed blue eyes groped piteous, ere they faded, Found me, and flashed the memory-branding fire Of wrathful love.—It was a holy ire!— I kept him not; and the sweet blooms that rise About my feet, bearing the purple dye Of his dropt blood, shall bear the charact'ry Of my vast woe; and I will print my cries On the dark leaves—????.. XXI And I for him, when the young earth doth cast her Frail flowers, low-drooping in the summer glow, Three days will consecrate to my great woe; Yea, and for him, I, of men's lips the master, Will teach them the corpse-stiffness; there shall come A day ungarlanded, unfeasting, dumb, On either side the feast's mid-day, the chief, When men shall think of death, that mighty wrong To youth, to sunshine, cithara, and song, And learn how the great sun-god in his grief Stooped the still shades among. XXII Shall I not gain all soul-realm, sorrow-gaining? Full near to tears must lie the heart whose reach, Seer, sybil, sacred threnodist shall teach, Thrilling each Muse's trembling child and paining To speech, or mightening into prophecy, Or melting into love. Must I not die, Who heal, deliver, ransom, and appal? Me, Themis-nurtured, men must own in fear, Plague, and destruction; yet feel ever near A god, whose lips have made the bitter call To one who cannot hear. XXIII He hears not, he is gone, gone past returning, Him on no broidered pasture I shall meet, Yet the rich purple fragrances my feet Of flowers that are his life blood. Ne'er did yearning Of the deep heart die victorless.—The field Dêmêtêr cursed, starving great Zeus to yield To her own terms;—the child, the gracious child, For whom her breasts grew milky, proper food For the maternal heart-fast. Her fell mood Moved heaven, and Hadês of his bride beguiled By the winged herald wooed. XXIV Oh, bitter pain that all men cherish passes! They chafe, nor the gods' kindly thought discern Through transitory things to bring return. With the fine green of the year's tender grasses Hope comes, because they withered in the heat; But can he come again, my mortal-sweet, To his immortal lover? Lo, mine eyes Have gotten tears for him, and through their gloom Can see but dimly how the belled flowers bloom Even where he faded:—a blue heaven lies O'er my beloved's tomb. XXV For ever and for ever are they token Of Love immortal, wed to mortal woe; Lord of the lyre-strings, I have learnt to know In my god's breast, how human hearts are broken, And from unfathomable pain can feed Men's lips with eloquence, till every need, Passion, despair, its imaged voice shall gain; Then will I compass them with dream, and teach That which will ravage inwardly, till speech, Passing through strong child-labour, shall attain To the prophetic reach. XXVI And I will guide men's thoughts, and bid them stumble, Build the fair tower, with earthquake rent appal, Train the dull ear to music's ordered fall, Then awe with surge of chaos, and make humble, That men may learn to listen deep what breath May never utter. Consecrate to Death Is light, and life, and lyre, for thou didst die, O Hyakinthos, and thy sun-god doom! Apollo's children now must seek the tomb To do him service, and his dark ????, Sad the sweet spring-flowers' bloom. XXVII Can the dark conquer thus? By the day's lifting Of cumbrous cloud; the orient crystal clear,— By the lute's call that even the dead must hear And wander lifewards; by the arrows, rifting The thunder-rocks of heaven, it cannot be! This hindering of the eyes, obscurity Of dust that fades the rose-leaf flesh to gray, Gives the chill odour, and the corpse-scent sweet, Has yet his waiting conqueror to meet: The aureate brow burns for the lustrous bay, Blazoning dull Death's defeat. XXVIII The coilèd dark shall feel the unravelling splendour:— Did not a quickened slime-bed's loathly den Foul my Parnassian clefts, and ravin men, Ere my loosed shaft, in impotent surrender Laid him, the master-victim of my bow? The vile thing rotted in the scorching glow; And men breathed freely.—My belovèd Land, Land I have lorded with delivering might, And compassed with divineness, as with light, One foe remains. Your victor god shall stand Fronting the great slain night. THE WORKSHOP UNDER AETNA. “Quotiens Cyclopum effervere in agros Vidimus undantem ruptis fornacibus Aetnam, Flammarumque globos liquefactaque volvere saxa!” I They toil with their huge heaving shoulders, As massive as rock-riven boulders; Like strings of the Mêlian's harp Their sinews are chorded: with sharp II Wrench of iron their fingers are twisted; Each muscle in toil is enlisted, And like rocks, flesh-knit, are their thighs. The sound of the chain in their sighs III Reveals them fierce captives unwilling, Some strange, awful service fulfilling; Vulcanian labour divine 'Mid the mountain-roots of their mine. IV Flames lurid or bronze-bright are lapping The ambient dark, and are flapping Against the stale, seasonless air, Ensanguining night everywhere. V Fierce, tawny forges roar lion-like, Dull-sounding hammers the iron strike, And beat the auriferous block, Till earth shakes aghast at the shock; VI And pale man looks up to the mountain, One luminous fire-spraying fountain; Feels the air grow pond'rous and still, Sees the loos'ning vines on the hill. VII Still labour those forms, rest forbidden, In forge-stricken darkness deep hidden; Blood-brown in the rubicund glare Glow limbs Ethiopic and bare, VIII Their ruddy right hands, wide and wielding, No instant to idleness yielding; A red sun their one-circled sight, Their craggy brows seaming with light. IX Their bent heads, gigantic and solemn, Above the dun neck's rounded column With locks heavy-capitalled,—locks Aglow from the rutilant rocks. X They are forging the Father's lightning, With flame the dull metal brightening; And their sweat feeds as oil the blaze, While the levin of wrath they raise, XI Till the softened gold can be woven, The shafts of the lightning cloven, Fang'd with Death, and quivered for clasp Of the god's omnipotent grasp. XII Man too has a labour Titanic, 'Neath Aetnean crater volcanic; Foredoomed 'mid reverberate strife To work for a bright higher life. XIII The furnace of passion must heat it, And blows of strong suffering beat it To the form a god's hands require, To mould of the Master's desire. XIV This life which we hate, or we cherish, Shall live, while in darkness we perish 'Neath the roots of the mountain mass, Which that forged light alone may pass. XV This Stygian dark seems so hollow; Our bright work we never may follow. If we love, we go with it too; As the Titans their spirit threw XVI To the lightning-shaft. Through surrender Of strength rose the keen, puissant splendour, Begot in the cramped, crippled form, The fetterless life of the storm! THE FLOWER-SUN. I Look on me, my great god, look goldenly! Let my fired maidenhood fold to a flower With glittering disk where thy bent face can bower A reflex of thy purple majesty In the unmitigated heavens: I see And passion to repeat thy perilous blaze Athwart my sun-dusked cirque and dazzling rays Of pointed petal; in the swarthening heat Of thy mid-orb that flaringly affrays I bask, a brimming flower-sun at thy feet. II Look on me, my great god, look goldenly! Cool-leaved the roses' blushes: to the brink Of my sun-seething cup I crave to drink Thy flame of life; no fruit so radiantly Ripens in thy caress, though scarlet be The pomegranate's sun-buried seeds, and grand The gourd's globed glory; none like me is tanned To Ethiop dusk by thy continuous glare. I am dark with thee, dreading not to stand Blazoning thy beams, when the mid heaven is bare. III Look on me, my great god, look goldenly! Once, oh, how golden-gentle was thy face, When thy right hand reined back thy steeds for grace Of my half-lifted brow; the other, free, Thou didst bend over me, and tenderly Didst round it cupwise to uplift my chin, And clasp my cheeks my trembling mouth to win For imprint of thy spirit-piercing kiss: Then did thy mighty rule in me begin Straitening to senseless loyalty my bliss. IV Look on me, my great god, look goldenly Though thou beat on me with a bitter scorn, With strokes that if my frail rose-flesh were worn Would blast it, I can bear thy cruelty, Bear anything, so like Leucothoê I lie not a corpse-exile from thy light: My petals close not from thee for the night; Patient in starry solitude, in wide Weariless golden watch, they wait the bright Heave of the heavens in the morning-tide. V Look on me, my great god, look goldenly On thy clear-mirrored self: men think I pine, Who mellow, burnish, revel in thy shine; While thou, sad Wooer, looking down must see Thy white dead Bride, and water fragrantly Her corpse with tears and drops of nectarous woe. Ravish deserted Klút?a with thy glow, Turn thy dimmed gaze where thy Leucothoê lies; She was warm-breathing when they laid her low In virginal close chamber from thine eyes. VI Look on me, thou great god, look goldenly! Oh, joy to think she feels thee not, nor sees! I knew not they would bury her: to ease My heart, where passion blazed funereally Over dead rapture, “Shall Leucothoê be, Father,” I urged, “by Phoibos' love beguiled?” Then fled from memory of the tender child As I last saw her shrinking from thy kiss In a soft timorous bashfulness: they piled Rough earth on that young cheek, nor wrought amiss! VII Look on me, my great god, look goldenly! Blur not thy beams; thou must not sport with death Or touch the sweet dead creature with thy breath, She may still pleasure thee—a balmy tree Yield precious frankincense perpetually As incense for thine altars: that fair doom I envy not; so only I may bloom The image of the heaven's throbbing flower, Drop thou sweet odours on Leucothoê's tomb On Klút?a thy consuming lustre shower. ERÔS AND ANTERÔS. Erôs in pity smiled across the tears Unloved Ianthê shed upon a breast Their limpid dew in laving did not stain; And comforted the child with vow to wound With his keen arrow the unriven heart Of Glaukos, who had robbed her of the grace Of careless maidenhood—the cloudless hours By fount, by distaff, 'mid the busy troop Of washers by the stream, or gayer throng Of those who wrought the peplos for their own Athênê, and bore joyous to her shrine: The youth should feel how love doth inly hurt; Ianthê's woes be lightened. By the god's Own darts was message brought of her desire And love-consuming languishment for him Who ne'er had wooed her: he, implacable, Took her love coldly as the gods take gifts Of fore-rejected suppliants; and the girl, Flushed with love-gendered hate and agony Of infamous refusal, turned to him Whom Erebos by Nux had gotten, blind, Dull-winged, a bearer of the leaden dart, And torch that spread the smouldering fire of hate 'Mid those who had despised the clean hearth-flame Of Hestia, or on Aphrodîtê's son Heaped the insufferable scorn. “Avenge Me of my wrongs; bring from thine own dark land All ills that thou canst summon: let him feel From love is bitterer banishment than light. Make his life upper Hadês: as the thirst Of ghostly lips for the forbidden blood That shall give pulse and passion, be his need Of the bright joys that impious he hath scorned. So will I give thee honour, Anterôs, Scorning thy brother's impotence.” He heard Who couched in Erebos, and summoned all The ills of that dark kingdom to his aid: But the proud heart, unconquerably cold, Could not be moved; more stubborn to resist Hatred's mad fury than essay of love. Ianthê rested unavenged. One day Flashed bright upon her the effulgent god Whose perfect puissance she had dared to doubt Since Glaukos still was pitiless. A kiss His mother gave him from the pouted lips Warmer to wake Adônis; and serene In lustrous loveliness he passed to her Who thought him vanquished. “I alone can harm, Thou faithless, thou mistrusting maiden; see, With smiling face I go to thy revenge; It shall be mortal.” Glaukos spied the boy And to his cold cheek rushed the glow: “Of me, Stung by thy sole defeat, audacious Love, Dost thou make double trial; I am proof. Though thy keen dart hath scarred Zeus' ivory breast, And drawn from Hêrê's bosom other pain Than angered her when Heraklês too hard Pressed for the milky sweets, and being loosed Let fall the drops brimming his baby lips On heaven's floor, a lovely lacteate stream!” “Rubied with clearest ichor, Erôs' shaft Will never dip in dye of Glaukos' blood.” So boasted the vain-glorious boy, and urged His heart to strong contention, emulous To gain a second victory o'er one Whose terrors shook Olumpos: but unmoved Erôs passed by him in a bright disdain, And of the god's indifference he died. “WHEN THE ROSES WERE ALL WHITE.” I Once, his feet amid the roses, When the roses were all white, Erôs wreathed the faint wan posies Round Zeus' goblet; but, ere sipping, 'Mid the buds his ankle tripping, Lavished half the vintage bright On the roses, that, fresh-dripping, Flushed the cup for heaven's lipping; And the god's eyes felt delight That the roses were not white. II But the sweetest of the roses, By that fiery rain unfed, Coyly still her bosom closes, Still the crimson vesture misses; Pale 'mid all the purple this is; Love, thy burning wine-drops shed! When her blushes make my blisses, Glowing answers to my kisses, In thy triumph be it said That the roses are all red.</field>
