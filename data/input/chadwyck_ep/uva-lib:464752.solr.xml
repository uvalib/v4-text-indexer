      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME the FIRST. [POEMS]. To the Right Honourable Mountague Venables EARL of ABINGDON, Baron Norreys of Ricot, &amp;c. The Ensuing POEMS are, with all Submission, most humby Dedicated By the Author's Relict Martha Gould. On the ensuing POEMS OF Mr. ROBERT GOULD, AND THE Death of the Ingenious Author. And is so soon the Lov'd Alexis gone! Who with such just regret erewhile did moan That best Good Man, that Pillar of the State! The great Bertudor and his early Fate. What is it then we would Immortal have, Since Heroes and their Poets find a Grave? Avails it not Those to deserve a Verse, Or These their Noble Actions to rehearse? Yes, yes it does, They both by this survive Themselves, and even to after Ages live. Hail then thou Bard! Tho' we thy Fate now mourn, Lawrels, that never fade, surround thy Urn. Who ever yet has so Divinely sung Unverst in any but their Mother Tongue? Not Shakespear, tho' set off with thy just Praise, Did e'er express himself such various Ways, But to the Stage confin'd his tuneful Lays. Thy Rival Sisters show how thy great Wit And lofty Genius cou'd the Buskin fit. In Pastorals thou speak'st in such a Strain, As best becomes th'ignoble, lowly Swain. Thy Sonnets, Hymns and Hymeneals suit Their several Subjects; as each several Fruit Its proper Tree: Congratulate, or Mourn, Or Praise, thou giv'st to each its proper Turn. But, when thou dost to pointed Satyr come, Thy Lashes cut, and all thy Thrusts are home; Witness, what justly might provoke thy Rage, The flagrant Vices of our Modern Stage, With which thou did'st so happily engage. Ah! had but Fate allow'd thee one short Span T'have perfected thy Satyr against Man! We then had seen Vice bare and ugly drawn, And in no other Features than her own: But— Heav'n, finding us so harden'd to Reproof, Beckon'd thee hence, and said it is enough. T. T. [Songs.] SONG I. Fatal Constancy. I Ciara, charming without Art, The Wonder of the Plain, Wounded by Love's resistless Dart, Had over fondly giv'n her Heart To a regardless Swain: Who, tho' he well knew Her Passion was true, Her Truth and her Beauty disdain'd; While thus the fair Maid By her Folly betray'd, To the rest of the Virgins complain'd. II Take heed of Man, and while you may, Shun Love's alluring Snare; The Joy it promises to Day Does e'er the Morrow flit away, And all the rest is Care. But if you love first Y'are certainly curst; Despair will insult in your Breast: The Nature of Men Is to slight who love them, And love those that slight 'em the best. III Yet let the Conqu'rour know my Mind, Ingrateful Celadon, That he will never, never find One half so true, or half so kind, When I am dead and gone! But as she thus spoke Her tender Heart broke: Death spares not the Fair, nor the Young: So Swans when they die Make their own Elegy, And breathe out their Lives in a Song. SONG II. The Mistress. I 'Tis not Beauty makes me love thee, Tho' like Venus soft and Fair; Nor for Wealth do I approve thee, Yet who wou'd not be thy Heir? Neither for thy Wit adore thee, Where we so much Smartness find; Or for Vertue fall before thee, Tho' the best of Woman kind. II What (you'll say then) is th'Occasion I such lasting Love pretend? What can else beget a Passion That must never know an End? Fair, I'll tell thee—'tis thy Nature That thus captivates my Mind; Pitying the Imploring Creature, You are proud of being kind. III Others tediously will tarry, Loth to grant the Am'rous Boon, Or expect a Man shou'd marry, Tho h' had better turn Dragoon. But while thus they deal precisely, Making Love and endless Task, You, my Angel, let us wisely Have the Blessing when we ask. SONG III. The March Chick. Written to be Sung by a Girl. I How happy! how happy is she That early her Passion begins? And, willing with Love to agree, Does not stay till she comes to her Teens: Love then is all pure and chast, Like Angels, its Smiles to be priz'd; Pleasure is shown you barefac'd, And Nature appears undisguis'd. II To be Twenty, or Thirty, and then Set up for a Lover is Vain; By that Time we study how Men May be rack'd with Neglect and Disdain: Love dwells where you meet with Desire, Desire much sooner appears; She's a Fool then that, feeling the Fire, Considers the Tale of her Years. SONG IV. A Pastoral Dialogue. HE. You tell me, Fair one, that you Love, Now is the Time your Faith to prove: Come, let us walk to yonder Grove. SHE. 'Tis late, I'm not for walking now: I love you Shepherd, that I vow; O is not loving you enow? HE. Thou dost blaspheme the Heav'nly Boy In being thus unjustly Coy; You cannot Love and not Enjoy. SHE. Alas! I am not yet Fifteen, Too young to tell what 'tis you mean: What Tast is there in Fruit that's green? HE. And Fifteen, pretty Love, with Thee, Is equal to a Score with me— Or, if you doubt me—come and see. SHE. I know not where Enjoyment lies, Unless it be in wishing Eyes, Quick heaving Breasts, and balmy Sighs. HE. O there is more! much more behind! Delight and Transport unconfin'd! All Heav'n it self—If thou art kind! SHE. Why do you gaze and tremble so? You squeeze my Hand, your Face does glow, And now, methinks, I tremble too! HE. Then 'tis with Chillness; if the Fire I feel had seiz'd you, you'd retire, And meet my Warmth with like Desire. SHE. No! no! I've nothing in me cold: A tingling Bliss is thro' me roll'd, I feel it—but it can't be told! HE. O then, while Love and Joy require, And Time's indulgent to Desire; O stay not till the God retire! SHE. Nay do not hurry me away; I dare not go—and wou'd not stay— [Aside. If you but lov'd me you'd obey. HE. I will not injure you I vow, Nor do no more than you allow— Ah! can you, Dear, distrust me now? SHE. I'll try you:—But don't force me on. If any Mischief shou'd be done, I'll go with you no more alone. [Exeunt. SONG V. Wit and Beauty. I When from her Beauty long I've strove To free my doating Heart, Her Wit brings back my fliting Love, And chains it down by Art. II Then, when her Wit I've often foil'd, With one commanding View, I'm by her Eyes again beguil'd, And Captive took anew. III Her Wit alone were vain, alone Her Beauty wou'd not do; But what the Devil can be done With Wit and Beauty too? SONG VI. The Complaint. I To me y'ave made a thousand Vows, A thousand tender Things have said; I gave you all that Love allows, The naked Pleasure of the Bed. II Yet now my Eyes have lost their Charms, Or you abate in your Desire: You dream y'ave Cælia in your Arms, And burn with an unhallow'd Fire. III Aloud you Name her in your Sleep; Or if toward me y'are pleas'd to stir, (A Kindness that but makes me weep) 'Tis only when you think of her. SONG VII. The Answer. I That charming Cælia I admire, I must with Pleasure own it true; But had I ten times more Desire, How could my Passion injure You? II Love is the sacred Tree of Life, And up to Heaven its Branches rears; Yet Admiration's but the Leaf, Enjoyment is the Fruit it bears. III Then while you raise this vain Dispute, Your Fondness but it self deceives: When you your self have all the Fruit, What need you envy her the Leaves? SONG VIII. Vertue the greater Charm. I While on my Breast the soft Deceiver lies, Balm in her Breath and Transport in her Eyes! I find the glowing wanton glad my Heart, Yet know she's false, and all her Fondness Art. II For to the next she likes, she does apply The self same soft'ning Look and kindling Eye; But 'tis to gratify her own Desire, She only warms us while we blow the Fire. III If she that's faithless has such pow'rful Charms, What magick Circle might you make your Arms? No more we'd doubt of Heaven but fix it there, Were you (O Cælia) but as kind as fair. SONG IX. The unwilling Inconstant. I Tho' she's so much for Beauty fam'd, That Age is with her Smiles enflam'd; Yet by some more resistless Art, That does unseen its Force impart, You raze her Image from my Heart, Which nothing, nothing else but Death could part. II O tell me quickly, charming Maid, By what new Witchcraft I'm betray'd? Since she I've sworn to Love is true, Nor only that but beauteous too, I shou'd a strange Injustice do To give the Heart, so justly hers, to you. III Try then, thou who without Controul Hast shot thy Form into my Soul (Whose Eyes still conquer with a View) O try (tho 'twill be hard to do) Yet try to make me hate thee too; I care not if I'm wretched so I'm true. SONG X. Falshood excus'd. I Why blames my Love her humble Swain For gazing upon Cælia's Eyes? Or in soft Notes t'express his Pain, While at her Feet he dying lies? II Her Look, 'tis true, does Love inspire, And long departed Warmth renew; Again it gives me fresh Desire, But then 'tis given all for you. III Enflam'd by her I come to thee To ease the Burden of her Charms; She does beget the Extasie, But it is born within thy Arms. SONG XI. The Wanderer fix'd I E'er I thy charming Visage saw, Each lesser Beauty gave me Law; This with her Sweetness, that her Pride, And I for either cou'd have dy'd: But when I first your Eyes did view, Strait to my Heart their Light'ning flew, Depos'd 'em all and set up you: Before the Magick of your Air, So fine your Shape! your Face so fair! Their fainter Charms did disappear, And were no longer what they were. II So of the Stars that gild the Sky, They've Reverence paid from every Eye; Not one but claims our lasting Praise, Not one but shou'd our Wonder raise, Not one but what's all Heavenly bright, A constant shining Globe of Light, Able alone to rule the Night. Yet, tho' so bright and glorious, they All in a Moment's time decay, Grow dim and seem to die away, When once Aurora opens Day. SONG XII. No Life if no Love. I Cælia is chast, yet her bright Eyes Are Motives to Desire; Each Look, each Motion does surprize, And lasting Love inspire. Her Smiles wou'd make the Wretch rejoice Expiring just before; And O! to hear her charming Voice Is Heav'n!—or something more! II And thus adorn'd, where e'er she turns Fresh Conquests on her wait; The tremb'ling restless Lover burns, Nor can resist his Fate. Ah Cælia! as y'are fair, be kind, Nor this small Grace deny; Tho' Love for Love I never find, Yet let me love or die! SONG XIII. Pity if you'd be pity'd. I Why (Cruel!) with that coy Behaviour Do you meet Amyntor's Flame? Why deny him ev'ry Favour That so much adores your Name? Adores it too, with such a Passion (Fervent, lasting and divine) As wou'd from all Hearts draw Compassion, All but that hard Heart of thine. II Gods! why thus d'ye wast your Graces? Why thus bountiful in vain? Why have Devils Angel's Faces? Why must Vertue meet Disdain? Wherever was a beaut'ous Creature That bore Light'ning in her Eye, But to her Lover shew'd ill Nature And cou'd smile to see him die? III 'Tis true, at last Heav'ns Indignation, Causeless Hatred to reprove, Makes her doat with equal Passion On some Youth averse to Love; One that regardless, sees her languish, Like a withering Lily Pine O pity then Amyntor's Anguish, Or that Fate may soon be thine. SONG XIV. The reasonable Request. I For Pity, Cælia, ease my Care; The Scorn your Eye does dart, Swifter than Light'ning pierces Air, Runs to my trembling Heart, The Pangs of Death are less severe When Souls and Bodies part: But Death I've oft invok'd to end your Reign; For what fond Wretch wou'd on the Rack remain, And have no use of Life, but still to live in Pain? II I not presume to beg a Kiss, 'Twou'd but enflame Desire; Or a kind Look, that Happiness Wou'd raise my Wishes higher; Nor yet your Love, for that's a Bliss Where I must ne'er aspire! No, this is all the Favour I implore, Nor was a smaller Boon e'er begg'd before, Do but believe I love you, and I'll ask no more. SONG XV. The Hopeless Comfort. I Tho' she believes 'tis her I like, And only her approve, From her hard Heart it will not strike One kindly spark of Love. II What if he doat (in Scorn she cries) And take a squinting View? Must I, in Pity to his Eyes, O'er look my Freedom too? III Thus does she sharpen with her Wit The Darts her Eyes have thrown; And in commanding a Retreat But goads her Lovers on. IV Some Comfort 'tis I'm not alone, All are like me undone: The Cruelty that favours none Why shou'd I hope to shun? SONG XVI. The Fruitless Caution. AMYNTOR. Take heed, fair Cælia, how you slight The Youth that Courts you now; For tho' fresh Charms, like dawning Light, Still flourish on your Brow, Yet fairest Days must know a Night, And so, alas! must thou. In vain, in vain You'll then complain; In vain your Scorn and Cruelty bemoan; For none can prove So dull, to Love When Age approaches, or when Beauty's gone. CÆLIA. Cease, fond Amyntor, cease your Suit, For 'tis but urg'd in vain: Who sows where he can reap no Fruit But Anguish and Disdain? Your whining Passion I despise, And hearken to't no more Than the deaf Wind to Seamen's Cries When all the Billows roar: For if when Youth and Beauty's gone I must be scorn'd of Men, I'll now revenge, e'er Age come on, My Persecution then. SONG XVII. The Invocation. I Some pitying Power that rules above To my Request encline: Since I must ne'er have Cælia's Love, For ever raze out mine. Her Scorn I can no longer bear! Tis Murder o'er and o'er! Ah! neither let me Hope or Fear, But ease my Passion by Despair, And she can wound no more. II Take her for ever from my Sight, A Fate like mine to prove; That she may feel, in all its Spite, The Curse of slighted Love: That swooning, raving with her Care, She may her Error find; How vainly Heav'n has made them Fair, That to their dying Lovers Prayer Are cruel and unkind. SONG XVIII. The Enfranchisement. I 'Tis past!—the mighty Torture's o'er, And Cælia's Reign is done: Nor know I but my Bliss is more Than if she had been won. When scorn'd, and crouching to the Dust, W'ave wasted half a Life. 'Tis certain such a Mistress must Make a more cursed Wife. II He is a most egregious Fool, And does his Peace betray, That thinks she'll then resign the Rule, So us'd to boundless Sway. O Liberty! thou best of Things! Thou sweet above compare! Can't that for which we strive with Kings Not make us slight the Fair? III In Love we, as in Wit, might reign, Did we not idly stray; Not fear'd, they never wou'd disdain, And not pursu'd wou'd stay. We dig our selves our timeless Graves; The Case is truly thus; Were we not vain and wilful Slaves, They wou'd be Slaves to us. SONG XIX. Help at Hand. I Take not a Woman's Anger ill; But let this be your Comfort still, That if one won't another will: Tho' she that's Foolish does deny, She that is wiser will comply; And if 'tis but a Woman what care I? II Who'd, then, be damn'd to swear untrue, And tremble, weep, and whine and woo, As all our supple Coxcombs do? All Women love it; and tho' this Does sullenly refuse the Bliss, Try but the next and you cann't miss. SONG XX. The Dream. I As sleeping, late, in Bed I lay, My restless Cares to sooth, Methought I heard a Female say— Why dost thou trifle Time away In vain, succesless Love? Grieve not at Cælia's proud Disdain, I'll soon thy Peace restore; I hither came to end her Reign, And thou shalt mourn no more. II I look't, and there did by me stand A Form all Heav'nly gay! Ah! Fair, I cry'd, and seiz'd her Hand, What you, and such as you command, No Man can disobey. Dear Youth, said she, such Love as thine Deserves a kinder Fate; You shou'd not, were your Heart but mine, Be us'd at such a Rate. III With that I strain'd her to my Breast, And she as closely clung: Her Lips, her Flame within confest, Her speaking Eyes declar'd the rest, And bid me not be long. But in the Mid'st of this Delight, Wound up a Pitch too high, Like Air she vanish'd from my Sight, Just sinking to comply. IV I wak'd, but wak'd to Misery, Perplext to an Extreme— But the next Nymph my Eyes did see Was Thee, my Silvia! very Thee! The same I saw in Dream! Ah! then delay me not with doubt, Nor vainly cruel prove; When 'twas thy very Soul stole out To tell me that you love. SONG XXI. The Enquiry. I How cou'd, O Silvia, Cælia's Scorn Compassion cause in Thee? How cou'd thy Love (all smiling born) Spring from her Cruelty? Th'Equivocal Philosopher Finds here his Reas'ning true; My Warmth begat a Chill in her, Her Ice a Fire in you. II That Like produces Like ev'n till This Hour I did dispute; But where's the Man be who he will, That Beauty can't confute? And yet, my Fair, w'are lost unless A Paradox it prove; For we can know no Happiness, If Love begets not Love. SONG XXII. The Boon. I Cou'd I believe when I did part From Cælia, that my tortur'd Heart Cou'd e'er receive another Dart, Not Raving with the bleeding Wound, And dying with the Smart? II But Beauty, tho' in some severe, In others to our Am'rous Care Delighted lends a list'ning Ear; All are not fooolish that are young, Nor cruel that are fair. III O Silvia! you redeem the Race From all their Rigour and Disgrace, Compassion in their stead you place; And the dear Moment of Delight Sits smiling on thy Face. IV Ah be but true! and bless my Flame With Ardour still to be the same, And to the Clouds I'll raise your Name Nor there shall stop; but, singing thine, Convey my Own to Fame. SONG XXII. Nothing wanting to Love. I Yes, Silvia, I was told but now, While on your Breast I lay My Head, and thus obsequious bow, I fool my Fame away; That Glory, while thus close I joyn My Lips and glowing Cheeks to thine, Stars wide and cries she'll ne'er be mine. II Let the false World true Passion blame, And Heav'n's best Gift despise; I'd rather be the Fool I am Than, without Love, be wise: Fame, Glory, and what e'er we find That captivates th'Ambitious Mind, I have 'em all if thou art kind! SONG XXIV. The Enquiry resolv'd. I O thou! to whom my Soul does bend! What is it that thy Charms intend? From whence, or how canst thou impart Such lasting Transport to the Heart? Where does the wond'rous Magick lie, Or in thy Voice, or in thy Eye, That make thy Adorers think the giv'n To grant us here a Tast of Heav'n? II Others we may as beauteous see, Yet we can gaze on only thee! One by her Truth her Lover charms, Another with her Vertue warms; This by her Wit asserts her Power, And this attracts us with her Dow'r; But to thy Share alone does fall Th'num'rous Gifts that charm us all! III 'Tis done; I've found the Myst'ry out Of which so many Lovers doubt. 'Tis not thy Shape, thy Face, thy Mein, Or any other Part that's seen (Tho' they so much our Wonder claim) That kindles such a deathless Flame; It is the constant Joy we find That one so beauteous is so kind! SONG XXV. The Caution. I Ah Silvia! have a Care—that Glance Alas! belong'd to me; Ev'n tho' thy Eyes but rov'd by Chance 'Twou'd yet Injustice be. I should not care indeed if thine Did but like common Beauties move; But Ah! those Lights can never shine Without inspiring Love. II What conquer'd me, alas! my Dear, Will others conquer too: In vain you cry, I need not fear, And promise to be true. If you are pleas'd when e'er you make Some other youthful Heart your Prize, Your Love its flight will quickly take, And wait upon your Eyes. SONG XXVI. The Lover's Fortune. I Cælia was cruel: Silvia, Thou, I must confess, art kind; But in her Cruelty, I vow, I more Repose could find: For O! thy Fancy at all Game does fly, Fond of Address and willing to comply. II Thus he that loves must be undone, Each Way on Rocks we fall; Either you will be kind to none, Or worse, be kind to all. Vain are our Hopes, and endless is our Care, We must be jealous or we must despair. SONG XXVII. The Tyranny of Love. I Not tho' I know she melting lies Prest in my Rival's Arms, Cou'd e'er disswade my longing Eyes From gazing on her Charms. II Tell me ye Powers that rule our Fate, Why are we made so vain? Why am I doom'd to wish for that Which 'twere a Curse to gain? III She's faithless yet I still adore; Ev'n Reason I despise; And find no Men in Sense so poor As those that think they're wise. IV O shun, they cry, the fatal Flame! Yet when the Nymph they see, They neither care for Wit or Fame, But perish pleas'd like me. SONG XXVIII. To Mirtillo. I Silvia has a thousand Charms, Her Look the hardest Heart disarms: While I stand gazing on her Face, Some new and some resistless Grace Fills with fresh Magick all the Place! Love his Darts around her throwing, Her Breath Arabian Spices blowing, And Venus was not half so knowing. II But while the Nymph we thus adore, We shou'd our wretched Fate deplore; For O Mirtillo! have a Care, Her Sweetness is above compare, But then she is more false than fair: Her chief Delight is in undoing, And tho' w'are certain of our Ruin, There is no stopping when w'are going. SONG XXIX. Silvia. I Fair and soft, and gay and young, All Charm! she plaid, she danc'd she sung! There was no Way to scape the Dart, No Care cou'd guard the Lover's Heart. Ah! why, cry'd I, and dropt a Tear (Adoring, yet despairing e'er To have her to my self alone) Was so much Sweetness made for one? II But growing bolder, in her Ear I in soft Numbers told my Care: She heard, and rais'd me from her Feet, And seem'd to glow with equal Heat. Like Heav'n's, too mighty to express! My Joys cou'd but be known by Guess! Ah! Fool, said I, what have I done, To wish her made for more than one? III But long I had not been in View, Before her Eyes their Beams withdrew: E'er I had reckon'd half her Charms, She sunk into another's Arms. But she that once cou'd Faithless be, Will favour him no more than me: He, too, will find he is undone, And that she was not made for one. SONG XXX. Women's Vows. I If Vows cou'd keep a Heart secure, Or Oaths cou'd make those Vows endure, My Happiness had still been sure; Clasp'd in her Arms I now had lain, And never known a Moments Pain. II But what are Vows that Women make? Or Oaths they, to confirm 'em, take, If they are only made to break? If they were never yet believ'd, But they that trusted were deceiv'd? III She Swore the num'rous Lamps above Shou'd all their Glory lose and move No more, if e'er she chang'd her Love: Stand still ye Stars and cease to shine, The perjur'd Maid's no longer mine! SONG XXXI. The Farewel. I Farewel, O Silvia! and in Thee Farewel to Love and Jealousie; To Grief, Distraction, Hope and Fear, And ev'ry other little Care That will be where the Lovers are; Farewel ye Legions of my Breast, All gone, now Woman's dispossest. II How well I lov'd I need not tell, I'll only say I lov'd too well. Thro' ev'ry Artery ev'ry Vein, The quickning Joy resistless ran, And ne'er was a more happy Man. Immortal Constancy I swore, And meant it—what cou'd Mortal more? III And yet remember how you still Wou'd steer my Reason by your Will: Now in a Storm you'd shew your Pow'r, Be sullen, sick, and sad and sour, And all these Changes in an Hour; Still ill at ease tho' ne'er so well, And how to please you none cou'd tell. IV On your Discourse I watchful hung, And thought all Musick from your Tongue; Tho' I cou'd nothing ever hear But whether Silks were cheap, or dear; Or Fashions for another Year: With Panegyricks on the Crew Of Fops that dress'd and patch'd like you. V But now your Flame began to wast, No Thought of any Promise past: To one of Wealth away you ran, But let him keep you if he can, Too needy I for the Trapan. O how my Poverty I prize! Wealth wou'd have kept on the Disguise. VI As Weather Cocks declare the Wind, In Thee I see all Womankind; See to what fatal Point they tend To whom they're haughty, whom they bend, And whom they martyr in the End. Fly (wretched Men!) th'alluring Race, All's Hell beside the Heav'nly Face. Love Verses. The Captive. Long I had laught at the vain Name of Love, And thought it Fiction all; it ne'er cou'd move My Eyes to wander, or enslave my Heart, Freedom and that were one, and were too fond to part; Freedom without whose Pastport Wealth were vain, Pleasure a Clog, and Life it self a Pain. But ah! too soon I found that Blessing gone, Whose Loss, I fear, I must for ever moan. I saw her, and no more; one pointed View Softn'd my flinty Breast, and pierc'd it thro' and thro'. O who can Love's resistless Darts controul, That thro' our Eyes so soon can reach the Soul! Yes Cælia, I'm your Captive from this Hour, But do not govern with Tyrannick Pow'r; Smile, and the Muse shall celebrate thy Name, Make it her constant Theme, and give it lasting Fame. To Cælia, desiring his Absence. Now Cælia y'ave your Wish—but ah! be kind To the poor Captive-Heart I leave behind; For tho' I go yet that with Thee remains, Proud that 'tis Thine, and triumphs in its Chains. For all the Beauties that are now unblown, When in their gaudiest Prime they shall be shown, And kneeling to be lov'd, I'd not my Flame disown; Tho' by that Time, perhaps, thy Charms might wast, And the gay Bloom of smiling Youth be past. Yet you Inflexible, Obdurate prove, And cry—'Tis false, 'tis feign'd, not real Love. While I, on t'other Side, with Grief confess Those Youths more happy that affect thee less. My Passion yet has born no Fruit but Care; And they that do not love thee don't despair. The Request. Hear me, O Pow'rful Charmer! e'er my Breath Is stopt by the ungentle Hand of Death; E'er my quick Pulse has ever ceas'd to move, And beats no more the Vital March to Love. E'er my sad Tomb you visit (wan with Care) And cry—The Youth had not lain silent here, If I had been less rigid and severe: 'Twas my cold Usage wing'd his timeless Fate; Too soon he lov'd, and I believe too late! Hear me, I beg, (if Truth may beg for Grace) Let not thy Heart bely thy Heav'nly Face: Thy Face is with Compassion cloath'd around, With Mildness and with smiling Mercy crown'd; Comfort has all her Influence from your Eyes, And you will smile when any Lover dies Kill'd by Disdain: To such your Pity shown, May make us hope you'll once regard your own: Let others Arrogantly tempt their Doom, And on their Birth, or Wealth, or Wit presume; I, humbler, only beg you wou'd not hate That Passion which your Beauty did create. To give Life for the Pleasure to destroy, Can be at best, methinks, but barbarous Joy. What Nature makes she wou'd continue still, She never quickens with Intent to Kill. Since to my Love you did it's Being give, Ah Smile! and let your own Creation live. Love can't be hid. Accurst and torn from the Records above, Be the sad Hour in which I own'd my Love: Curst be the Wretch that did the Message bear, That made her tender Nature grow severe, And plung'd me, hopeless, deeper in Despair, And curst my self (if there a Curse remain, If yet there be a Plague beyond Disdain) Who did the inauspicious Lines indite That banish'd me for ever from her Sight! O Slave! O Wretch! despis'd, forlorn, undone! I grasp'd at Joy and pull'd my Ruin on. She sung, and I was call'd her Voice to hear, What a delicious Feast for Hope was there! Then when she danc'd so gracefully she'd move, At first 'twas Wonder, but at last 'twas Love! Her Look, like Light'ning, did all Bars controul, And let her all entire into my Soul! Her ev'ry Action did Delight create, And I was blest more than I can relate. All this with Silence, all had still been mine, I spoke, and streight that Sun forbore to shine; The smiling Heav'n was in a Moment fled, And endless Woe presented in its stead. O Slave! O Wretch!—Yet why shou'd I complain? By Fate compell'd, I have reveal'd my Pain, And so shou'd do were it to do again: That Spirit Love what subtle Chain can bind? What Strength, what Prudence keep it long confin'd? Resistless, thro' all Lets 'twill force its Way, And when once Master will no more obey. Despair. In vain I write, in vain I strive to move Her, whose stern Nature is averse to Love: Ah cruel Nymph! Ah most regardless Fair! Or wert thou born to give me endless Care? 'Tis said this Glorious Frame, and all above, Those num'rous shining Lights that round us move, Were rais'd from Chaos at one Word of Love. Thro' the wide Wast blest Order swiftly flew, And wild Confusion chang'd her grisly Hue; By her own Offspring Discord was forsook, And the glad Spheres their constant Motions took; Wide as their Influence spreads, to either Pole, In mystick Dance harmoniously they roll, And with like sacred Union tune the Soul: The Soul, for Beatifick Vision giv'n, Breath'd from the Godhead, and its Centre Heav'n: Both this and that on the same Axle move, For Heav'n is Union, and the Soul is Love. Love that does reach where ever Light extends, And thither too a warmer Influence sends; Nor when the Night arrives his happy Reign he ends. From his Eternal Sway there's nothing free, All the Creation own his Power—But Thee, Thee Cupid flies, and Thou dost Cupid shun, Thy Eyes, more Cruel, do the Work alone. He wounds the Heart, but gives in Time Relief; You to the very Soul transfuse the Grief: No Help design, no Pity e'er intend, Unless in poor Amyntor's speedy End. Thy Eyes, those Beams of Heav'n if Love were there, Are but to me a sad portentous Star, Where in broad Characters I read—Despair! Despair then, Wretch, nor longer strive to move Her whose stern Nature is averse to Love. The vain Pursuit. To a Lady that desir'd him to write to her in Verse. Cloe, when you are pleas'd Commands to lay, Tho' 'twere on Kings, they'd readily obey; Much more may I, then—so much less than they. But ah! I fear my humble Verse will move You rather to despise it, than approve; For I can write of nothing else but Love. Of nothing else; 'tis my perpetual Theme, That flows as 'twere an inexhausted Stream, In all I say, or do, or think, or dream. Sometimes I take my Book and go to Prayer; But Love, fond Love ev'n interrupts me there, And turns my vain Devotions into Air. Long have I search'd but never yet cou'd find The happy Balm that heals a wounded Mind: There's not a Star in Heav'n but what's unkind. For the hard She that I am doom'd t'obey, From my Pursuit for ever flies away, And Fate it self's too weak to bribe her Stay. Shadows that flit before us o'er the Plain, As fast pursue when we return again; But She ne'er turns, and ne'er can be o'ertane. This is the rigid Fate I'm forc'd to bear: And tell me, Fair one, is it not severe That so much Love shou'd meet so much Despair? Despair, the bitter Bowl, as Authors tell, That to the Brim does with such Poison swell, As makes the Furies lash themselves in Hell. Her Name I will conceal—My Reason why, Because there's none shall blame me when I die, That one so low shou'd have a Thought so high. The Hopeless Lover. In a Vision to Cælia. 'Twas now the Time when all Remains of Day By the thick Shades of Night were chast away: Silence and gentle Sleep fill'd ev'ry Breast, And Nature's self seem'd to retire to rest. Nothing but Fancy (for she ever wakes, And, unconfin'd, her roving Journey takes O'er Hills, o'er Dales, o'er Flow'ry Meads and Lakes: Sometimes she mounts aloft where Angels dwell, And in a Trice shoots down from thence to Hell, There all the Tortures of the Damn'd does view, And almost makes us think we feel 'em too.) Nothing beside was free; and 'twas her Will To shew the Pastimes of her Antick Skill. Wrapt deep in Sleep I lay, the Scene she drew; And this was that presented to my View. I look'd, and Lo! I saw a Nymph as fair As Guardian Angels in Idea are Her Mien so graceful, and her Eyes so bright, Their Lustre did supply the absent Light. Musing, I on the dazling Object gaz'd, At once delighted, and at once amaz'd. But witness for me Heav'n, for you know best, What a Confusion seiz'd my trembling Breast, When drawing nearer for a stricter View (Not thinking that beauteous Form I knew) I found 'twas Cælia, causer of my Smart, Cælia! the cruel Empress of my Heart. Whose Eyes methought at my approach shot Flame, Arm'd with that direful Weapon, sharp Disdain. Backward I stept, grim Horror seiz'd my Heart, And stab'd it round in every Vital Part; Nor had I Strength to bear the painful Wound, But fainted, and fell Speechless to the Ground, Beyond the Reach of Human Pow'r to save, Had not these Words recall'd me from the Grave. Amyntor, Rise and hear your Cælia speak, I bring the Cure, the only Cure you seek. Despair no more (that Bane of all Delight) Shall break your Peace by Day, or Rest by Night, But chas'd by me, take everlasting Flight. Rise, and to meet thy coming Joy prepare This happy Hour for ever ends your Care. Reviv'd with this dear Language up I sprung; But Fear had barr'd all Utt'rance from my Tongue: A thousand Doubts roll'd in my troubl'd Breast While I stood trembling to expect the rest: Kind tho' she seem'd, her Eyes commanded Death, And my pale Fate hung hov'ring o'er her Breath. Dear Youth (continued she) the Scorn I've shown Was only to confirm you more my own: For if your Passion were from Interest pure, I knew 'twoud the severest Test endure. 'Twas this to be assured of made me feign All the sharp Rigours of unjust Disdain. And who alas! will blame me that reflects How many of our frail believing Sex Are lost (be they as vertuous as they can) By the fair specious Arts of faithless Man? How oft d'ye vow y'are our eternal Slaves? Yet Tyrants grow and drive us to our Graves. When once possest for what you feign'd to burn, You treat us with Neglect, Disdain and Scorn, And mighty Love to rude Contempt does turn. Such Thoughts as these made me with Caution move, And on a sure Foundation build my Love: For who e'er gain'd it, I well knew wou'd find 'Twas not the Passion of a fickle Mind, Changing as Tydes, and Wav'ring with the Wind; But fix'd like Fate, from whence its Essence came, Ever to last, and always be the same, And so, Amyntor, so to you I give A Heart which for you only wish'd to live. Charm'd with the tuneful Sound her Accents bore, I was all Joy! as all Despair before. Not the least Mark of Sorrow did remain, This one blest Moment cancell'd all my Pain. So a just Martyr'd Saint thro' Heaven does range, And so does wonder at his happy Change! At last the Transport giving Way I spoke, And in these Words the pleasing Silence broke. Thou truest Image of the Pow'rs above, For They like You will frown on him they love, But when thro' much Adversity h'has past, Like You, they bounteously reward at last: For Perseverance wins their Love divine, And Perseverance too has gain'd me Thine. Y'ave sav'd me from Despair! and rais'd me to A Pitch of Joy where yet my Wishes never flew! Surprising turn!—Oft have I sent my Cries (With Care kept waking) echoing to the Skies. How oft (the constant Mourner of the Grove) Have I sat weeping my improsp'rous Love? How oft did I to senseless Trees complain? Whose whistling Leaves breath'd back my Woes again. Hard Stones of Adamant e'en seem'd to hear, And in Compassion oft wou'd drop a Tear; You, harder yet, ne'er lent a pitying Ear. So moving was each tender Sigh and Groan, E'en Philomel has ceas'd her Midnight Moan, And thought my Griefs more piercing than her own. Unkind, relentless Cælia (wou'd I cry) Must I thus scorn'd and thus unpity'd die? What is it that my humble Love requires? Only a Sigh just as your Slave expires: Without Reluctance then to Death I'd go, Meet him half way, and bless the coming Blow; Her Frowns can't reach me when I lie so low. Such were the Words my wild Despair let fall Such were my Griefs—but this o'er pays 'em all. Thus I, me thought, my Passion's Progress mourn'd, When Cælia, weeping, this Reply return'd, Amyntor! How shall I your Peace restore? Or how reward the Pangs for me you bore? My Love, I fear is a Return too small, Take with it then, my Life! my Soul! my All! Here she sunk speechless down into my Arms, Melting! and melting me too with her Charms! What shou'd I do? All over Warmth I prest Her close, and held her panting to my Breast Ah! Fair, I cry'd, (while in that Union join'd) Y'ave own'd I'm true, and now I own you're kind, What then, at last, but the dear Joy remains? That now we reap the Fruit of all our Pains? You must not, can't, you shan't deny the Bliss— O come!—I han't the Leisure for a Kiss. See here the Fate that over Love does reign! How short the Pleasure, and how long the Pain! For O! no sooner had the accursed Sound Of these last Words unwary Utt'rance found, But the fair Vision took her unseen Flight, And swiftly vanish'd thro' the Shades of Night. Awak'd, I started up and gaz'd around, But not one Glimpse of the lov'd Shadow found: My Arms I clos'd and thought it yet was there, But nothing now was to be clasp'd but Air: 'Twas gone! 'twas gone! and with it fled away All the dear Hope I had of future Joy! Eternally relentless Pow'rs above! Must all my constant Service fruitless prove? And never, never pierce the Heart I love? Must I for ever in these Pangs remain, Doom'd to love on, and doom'd to love in vain? But 'tis your Will—and I shou'd not complain. Yet O (if hapless Love may dare contend) Had you but let the Vision know no End, That, wrapt with the imaginary Charms, I might have slept whole Ages in her Arms; In vain of more substantial Blessings free, That dear Illusion had been Heav'n to me! But the same Minute we expect Relief, To find a sure and still encreasing Grief, Is of all human Curses, sure the chief: For know, O Cælia, O disdainful Fair! I must still love thee, tho' I still Despair. The first Sight of Silvia. Is it resolv'd that I must ever find Cælia relentless, and no other Kind? Too long, alas! and too much Love I've shewn To one that is but harden'd by my Moan: That Grief which Tigers Pity she will mock, Deaf to entreaty, and her Heart a Rock. Let me at last, O Love! some Female see, Mild as the op'ning Morn, but fair as she: I wou'd not die methinks, before I'd prov'd (As 'tis to Love) what 'tis to be belov'd. I spoke; the God, propitious now, did hear, And said—D'ye see that Charming Figure there? Behold this Bow, drawn up with Strength and Art, See! the Shaft flies and lodges in her Heart. Now laugh at those that tell you Love is blind: Away, nor doubt a quick Relief to find, Your Cruel you shall change for one as Kind. I came, and to her Cheeks the Blushes flew, The Lilies streight had lost their Native Hue, And in their Room a Grove of Roses grew: I found the Frailty climbing to her Eyes, And in short Starts her Breasts wou'd fall and rise: Yet with a Maiden Coyness still she strove, And scarcely yet will own her Passion, Love. O Silvia! (for of whom can all this be Discours'd or meant, but only only Thee? The God of Love himself your Love foretold;) And what he gives 'twere Impious to with-hold. Silvia Luke-warm. Now while I languish on your gentle Breast, That Pillow where my Cares are hush'd to rest; While our plump Veins are full of Youthful Fire, And Nature able to make good Desire; Why at this Season, in Love's choicest Prime, Shou'd you conceive that I indulge a Crime To urge Enjoyment? Which you rather ought Believe th'Effect of Passion than a Fau't. Think, Lovely Charmer, how the Minutes fly, And the preventing Spite of Destiny: Our vig'rous Days alas! will soon be gone, And Age and Impotence come swiftly on. Let us not then thus wast the precious Time, 'Tis that, O Silvia, that's the greatest Crime; For as that's trifled and consum'd away, Who knows too, but our Passions may decay? Enjoyment will preserve the Flame entire, No other Fuel can maintain the Fire, That's Love indeed! the rest is but Desire; That is the Oil that makes the Colours last, While Paints in Fresco fret away, and wast. For Pity then change your half yielding Mind, To be but kind in Part is much unkind Luke-warm Indifferency I cannot bear; Such tedious Hopes are worse than quick Despair. Silvia kind. Yes! this is to be blest! there is beyond No human Joy so lasting to be found: Or this is Heav'n, or something else so near, That Saints for less wou'd stay for ever here. Cou'd such delight be but below our Fate, Who'd run the Risk of any future State? Thy Eyes now shoot, indeed, a Lover's Fire, And the same Joy the Look in mine inspire. You say your self you soon will ease my Care, And to your Words your Blushes Witness bear; Blushes whose Colour richlier does adorn Thy Cheeks, than those that paint the op'ning Morn. Thy very Soul into the very Face does rise! The Woman can no more thy Love disguise, And Truth, in spite of Art, sits Victor in thy Eyes! Behold, O Lovers! how at last you gain An ample Recompence for all your Pain. One Promise that the Fair will give Relief, Suspends our Care, and eases ev'ry Grief: Such perfect Joy our very Hope exceeds, Only outdone by that which it preceeds! O pleasing Agony! O happy Hour! That puts the yielding Angel in my Pow'r! When on her Sweets I feast with panting Breath, Pursuing Pleasure to the Verge of Death! But Lo! just in the Mid'st of my Career, As thus I drove to Bliss, and thought it near, Reason o'ertakes, and Bids me have a Care. In such vain Thoughts (said he) y'are misemploy'd; Y'are yet not happy, yet she's unenjoy'd. When Pleasure smiles oft adverse Fortune low'rs; What may be lost is yet not wholly ours. Think not in Woman certain Joys to find, 'Till in her soft and circling Arms entwin'd, She gives the last dear Proof of being kind. Silvia in the Country. As in that Region when the Glorious Sun Does rise, that had for half a Year been gone, All Nature smiles; and Joy in ev'ry Eye, Welcoms his Re-ascension to the Sky! But when he back to Southern Climes retires, In vain their Furrs of Beasts and constant Fires; The Beast himself for want of Warmth expires. So, till you left us 'twas all Radiant Day, But Night! perpetual Night now y'are away; In vain we gaze, and fix our weary Eyes Upon that Quarter where the Gleams shou'd rise, No Sign of Light appears, no Glim'ring Dawn, But all around the gloomy Curtain drawn. But as the Sun, when from our Hemisphere Declin'd, to distant Realms his Beams does bear; So tho' remov'd from hence, you there are bright, Lost to our Eyes, not lessen'd in your Light: In ev'ry Breast you there like Ardor move, Shine at full Blaze and give all Creatures Love! Amaz'd and pleas'd with Joy your Voice they hear. Thoughtless of us that mourn in Darkness here. So smil'd the Chosen Seed when Egypt lay In its long Night, and 'twas at Goshen Day. Thus I her Absence mourn'd: When Love again Appear'd, and wonder'd why I did complain. Is she not there (he said) where best I know To fix my Darts, and most my Pow'r can show? In shady Groves, on Flow'ry Banks reclin'd, With Garlands wreath'd, and fann'd with od'rous Wind, The Lover oft a Blessing does receive, Which Courts with all their Splendor ne'er cou'd give; A Comfort that Remembrance can't destroy, A Conscious Innocence, and Guiltless Joy! Let it not grieve you that the Fair's retir'd, 'Tis only to be follow'd and admir'd: Among the Rural Nymphs as there she lies, She may be pleas'd, perhaps, to own her Prize, To shew to them the Triumphs of her Eyes. There she perhaps may Love's Reward dispence; O Warmth of undissembl'd Innocence! There Lips to Lips, with glowing Ardor join'd, May introduce you to a Scene more kind; When, Breathless, in your Arms the Fair expires, And, Life returning, the same Death desires! Wish her not then in this ill Town again, The vast Exchange of all Things lewd and vain, When she so much the happier Lot enjoys, Free from those Ills which here my Power destroys, Love's not conceiv'd, nor born, nor lives in Noise: Eternal Jargon, Rattle, Storm and Fewd Dwell here, and ev'ry Day the Din's renew'd. There Innocence and Joy and Silence reign, And spread their sacred Influence thro' the Plain: There the Harmonious Quire in Copses sing Their Airs Divine, and Prophesy of Spring: Ev'n Nature smiles and yields 'em all that's rare, At least she, sure must smile now Silvia's there. Away then (Absence will not do the Thing) Your Reason to the Swallow's Custom bring, The Spring don't seek 'em but they seek the Spring. He ceas'd; and strait the Heav'nly Form withdrew. Ah Silvia! what must poor Amyntor do? Impatiently he thy lov'd Sight affects, And Counsel's sacred when a God directs. Blame me not then if I presume on those Retirements which your Solitude has chose; I must be happy where you find Repose. There I will trace your Steps thro' ev'ry Grove, And sigh, and wish, and look perpetual Love! There I perhaps the happy Hour may find: No Female ever yet was all her Life unkind. Misled by Hope, and flatter'd by my Theme, How far I stray? How idly do I dream? While I discourse of Joys imagin'd there, She's absent still, and I unhappy here. A Letter from Silvia. However Fate may have dispos'd of mine, This happy Moment I was blest with thine. Ah cou'd but mine to thee like Pleasure give!— But let that Perish, so thy Lines may live. The Superscription shew'd from whence it came, To dear Amyntor!—That disclos'd thy Name; Without 'twas Warmth, but it within was Flame! Swift from my Heart it did all Anguish drive, Not richest Cordials cou'd so soon revive. So soft the Stile, it more than Wonder moves! As if the Quills dropt from the Paphian Doves, To sign the Contract, and record our Loves. Thy Vows in thy own Characters are wrote; And thy fair Hand has vouch'd thy generous Thought: Here's Witness now that will to Ages last, Your Faith is plighted, and your Promise past. With so much Sweetness is your Passion drest, That Sweetness with such Innocence exprest, I read, I see, and think I'm with the Blest! Nor are thy Lines but active in my Eyes, To ev'ry other Part the Influence flies; To ev'ry Sense it equal Joy procures; But the Conclusion most my Bliss assures, To see you thus subscrib'd—For ever yours! For ever! happy Accents! sacred sound! For ever! let it reach the Starry Round! For ever! let the Hills and Vales rebound! Away all anxious Fears, all Reason hence, And ev'ry Thought that doubts her Innocence; No more I'll to your Cautions credit give; Who least suspects does least in Trouble live. The must be true!—as Flames to Heav'n ascend, As heavy Bodies to their Centre tend; So she to Vertue wings her steady Flight, Rising, and yet encreasing to our Sight: For Bodies as they mount are less'ning still, But Vertue as it climbs the Airy Hill, Enlarges, and like Light do's all th'Horizon fill. But while her Worth thus entertains my Mind, I have forgot her Vows of being kind. Fly swift, ye Moments, bring her to my Eyes That strain with longing for that Light to rise. Bring her resolv'd and warm to my Embrace, With Love's last Ardour flashing in her Face— She's here! I see! I feel her!—to my Breast I press her, twining round me!—but the rest, Like Heav'n, is Pleasure not to be exprest! Strange Force of Love! if barely with the Thought I'm to so high a Pitch of Rapture wrought, What must Enjoyment be? and what her Charms When she (indeed) is melting in my Arms? Silvia yet in the Country. Tho' Misbelievers to our Faith are blind, O Silvia! we may say our Souls are join'd, For what's true Love but ming'ling Mind with Mind. Not thro' past Ages can a Pair be found Whose Truth deserves more nobly to be crown'd, Or will in after Days be more renown'd. Ev'n Friendship burns but dim, not worth a Name, When 'tis compar'd with our more mutual Flame, And not so well deserves Immortal Fame, In thy dear Arms my Cares were always eas'd, Nor cou'd I ever grieve when you were pleas'd: Still so concern'd, so studious of your Good, For ev'ry Tear you shed my Heart wept Blood. Nor was your Passion charming Silvia less, Too strong to warp, too copious to express; A languishing, a lasting, Lambent Flame, Bright as thy Eyes, untainted as thy Fame; Fresh as the Dawn when first Aurora springs, And soft as Down upon an Angel's Wings! Such was our Love, so we entranc'd did live, Contented, and what more had Heav'n to give? What but Enjoyment? Whence all Hopes deriv'd, That last dear Point where yet w'are not arriv'd! Blest were these Hours, and ah! they swiftly flew! But who e'er kept soft Pleasure long in View? Like Birds she sits and prunes her in our Eyes, And if we stir away the Wanton flies; Brooks no Confinement, but thro' Rural Groves And shining Courts with equal Freedom roves; Fixt only there where Love with Vertue meets, Yet then not always Liberal of her Sweets: Ev'n present Lovers of her Grudgings find, In vain the Absent then expect her kind. What ever Am'rous Lectures she has read, Departing, she unsays what she has said, And leaves Despair to govern in her stead. In the soft lonely Hours of silent Night, When Nature does to general Rest invite, Ev'n then the absent Lover's Eyes are wide, When ev'ry Human Care is fast beside. Or if he sleep (expos'd to all Extremes) His Doubts preside, and hag him in his Dreams. Waking, he in disorder'd Looks appears, Pale with his Sorrows, and all drown'd in Tears: At last not able to contain his Grief, He thus complains, but hopeless of Relief. Ah Wretch! what am I born to undergo? Successive Days but bring successive Wo! There never was a Beauteous Creature yet But might be won with Riches, Worth, or Wit: Curst Fate! that dooms me to continue here! I've many Rivals so accomplish'd there. As she is Lovely she must Lovers gain, And Youth to Youth solicits not in vain; The Kindler's kindled with like Am'rous Fires, Desires incestuously beget Desires. Ah! see! she melts and can no longer hear The Voice of Vertue—Faithless! perjur'd Fair! The Conq'rour sees her faint, and presses on— Confusion! she is lost, and I'm undone! Ah! think thou lovely Partner of my Heart, (And lovlier as thou hast no Helps from Art; Less bright are they that lie in Princes Arms, For she that's Vertuous has ten thousand Charms) Ah! think if Absence can so painful be To others, that (tho' in a less Degree) It will, it is, it must be felt by me. But I'll not now afflict thee, nor dilate On what I suffer from so hard a Fate, Since the Time's nigh that will disperse our Harms, And bring us blest to one anothers Arms. This tho' believe; what e'er my Griefs may be, There's none arises from my Doubts of thee. Silvia Return'd. She comes! and with her does all Sweetness bring: Tho' Summer's o'er and Birds have left to sing She in the very Fall revives the Spring! At least Her Aspect so our Care beguiles, We see no change of Seasons while She smile. Both Love and Joy at once enflame her Eyes, And in my own I feel like Rapture rise. I see! I have her now! with all her Charms, So long with-held from my Impatient Arms! But O! such Perfect Bliss she does dispence, The very Sweets opress my aking Sense! If from your Presence such Delight can flow, Ah Silvia! what was, late, my Absent Woe? But all my Pains you in your own might know: For faithful Love (as Thine was so to Me) Must have in Absence like effects on Thee. But thou'rt Return'd? and I no more will grieve! This happy Moment I begin to Live. The Æra of my Joys I'll date from hence, Nor with it shall one guilty Thought commence; For there's no Peace where there's no Innocence And that, in Love, the God to none allows, But those to death persisting in their Vows. O Silvia! do not then the Bliss delay, Be just to Love, and fix the happy Day. Let me not, Moses-like, on Pisgah stand, At Distance to survey the promis'd Land, But since so much y'ave giv'n give the rest— Ah! what is Heav'n if seen and not possest? To Silvia, On deferring our Nuptials. See how the Morning, Radiant in it's Beams, Does suit th'Occasion; flush't with kindling Gleams, Like Brides in their Preliminary Dreams. Never before with a more Lovely Ray Did glad Aurora paint the rising Day. Look out, my Silvia, on this glorious Sight, And add thy Lustre to this Scene of Light! Thy Ruddier Blushes will ev'n Hers adorn, And gild her Brightness, as that gilds the Morn. She wakes! she rises! and all Hands employs To make her dress an Emblem of her Joys: And see! at last all sparkling she appears! But why, my Silvia, why these wayward Tears? Why with such boding Drops dost thou destroy My Hopes, and hang a Clog upon my Joy? O dry thy Eyes! the promis'd Hour's in sight, And the Scene opens to immense Delight! The Priest attends, the Guests impatient stay, And Phœbus Labours to make short the Day. O come! Our happy Hours on Earth are few, And e'er the rising Sun w'ave much to do. Ha! say'st thou!—must our Nuptials be delay'd? Am I unkind? Or is thy Flame decay'd? That thus I'm on the Brink of Pleasure staid, Ev'n now when Cupid wou'd with Hymen meet, To make our Comforts lasting as they're great? Or is't thy Fear that causes this Delay?— But that I'll soon remove—thy Hand, away: See all the Virgins wonder at thy Stay! You blush! alas! what e'er those Blushes mean, Consider by and by they'll not be seen; Veil'd from their Eyes, the Curtains then shall close, And give us Sweets much softer than Repose. Ha! why that rising Coldness on your Brow? It chills me too that was so warm but now! In vain, you say, I urge you to comply, In vain the Transport of my Voice and Eye, You will have longer time:—and let it be, You never shall be disobey'd by me. But think! ah think the Future Fate assures To none! the present Moment's only ours; It courts us now, and bids us Pleasure chuse, For ever lost if unenjoy'd it goes! Still you persist—yet faithful to your Vow; I shall be blest, tho' disappointed now. Alas! an Hour will be an Age to me— But then, by Love, I'll be reveng'd on thee. I'll revel then thro' all the Sweets thou hast, Profuse of Joy, and lay whole Regions wast! O'er all thy rich Sabæan Coasts I'll rove, And stifle in the Fragrances of Love! With mutual Ardor, Bliss and Warmth we'll strive, Die, but to live! and faint but to revive! E'en thou thy self (tho' now so nicely coy) Shalt all thy Strength, thy Sense thy Soul employ! And wish y'had sooner known the Racking Joy! Silvia's Indifference. Ah! 'tis too sure! the Change appears at last, And all my Hopes are, like a Vision past! Instead of Love, dislike in Frowns does rise, And the kind Fervour's vanish'd from her Eyes. As in a backward Autumn, when the bright Hyperion gives a raw and sickly Light, The unrip'ning Fruit upon the Branches dies, The with'ring Leaf around in Ruin lies, And only Winter Scenes salute our Eyes, So does her Coldness all Love's Product blight, To Hope infectious, fatal to Delight. The soft'ning Influence of her Eyes she veils; No more her Breath is spent in am'rous Gales: Hymen himself at Distance feebly shines, And wonders why so swiftly He declines. She now surveys me with no more Concern Than Vice that Vertue which it scorns to learn. If she does write, such Frost is in her Stile, I read—but am in Greenland all the while. My Voice (once prais'd) no more affects her Ears Than Sermons which an Atheist yawning hears. Or if I dance with like regard she sees As fearful Beauties wou'd a loath'd Disease. When e'er I gaze upon her Eyes, their View She turns to find out Objects vain and new. The Oaths of perjur'd Men affect her more Than all the sacred Oaths I ever swore. Musick she finds when others Love relate, From me it sounds like the last Call of Fate. Nothing I say, or do, or look can move, Tho' e'ery Word's breath'd from the Soul of Love. I sigh! I weep! I bleed! I burn! I die Nor this affects her Heart, nor that her Eye, She hears, she sees, and walks regardless by. E'en Hope, that last Reserve, to Scorn does yield, And wild Despair rides Victor o'er the Field; Upon her Cruelty he rears his Throne, With barbarous Joy beholds the Day his own, And smiles, like her, to hear the dying Groan. Thus, Silvia, were (by your Neglect constrain'd) My Thoughts last Night in Vision entertain'd: Thus 'twas I talkt, these very Words I write Did anxious Fancy to the Muse indite. I never, waking, said you were untrue, Nor can I close the intellectual View. Let it at least, preserve me thy Esteem, That all my Doubts of thee are but a Dream. Whatever Sleep suggests, what e'er my Fears, And all that in thy alter'd Look appears, You are, you shall, you will, you must be just And I abuse thee by a mean Distrust. Thou dost but for a while eclipse the Light Of Love, to make it dearer to our Sight: The Mask took off, but more commends the Fair, And Hope arises brightest from Despair. Silvia Perjur'd. She has (ye Gods) forgot the Vows she made, And, conscious flies the Wretch she has betray'd. But if she's yet not past the Pow'r of Love, If Constancy has Charms, or Verse can move, I'll bring thy Vertues back forgetful Fair, And prove that plighted Oaths are something more than Air. In such sad Strains I'll my Distress impart, So lively will I paint my bleeding Heart, E'en thou thy self shalt be amaz'd to see So swift a Change from Joy to Misery! I had no Respite between best and worst, Fed but to starve, and happy to be curst; Precipitated by a sudden Blow, From the Extreme of Bliss to that of Woe! Yet (Cruel Maid!) my Crime let Envy tell, I was too humble, and I lov'd too well. Did Angels know my Truth as well as you, Ev'n they wou'd wonder Man shou'd be so true: But wonder more to see thee faithless prove When there is scarce a purer Flame above: What can there There from Each to Each be paid But endless Love, and Fervor undecay'd? You know, and I shall ne'er forget the Time (Lock'd in my Arms, nor Kisses then a Crime) When on your Bosom I expiring lay (How short is Pleasure! and how soon 'twas Day!) While with our Breath our very Minds we mixt (The Marriage promis'd, and the Day prefixt) 'Twas then by the Immortal Pow'rs you swore, Nay by your Mut'ual Love, and that was more, That 'twas to me your Life, your Soul you'd give, And for me only that you wish'd to Live! Did I not there affirm the same to you! You heard, you saw (with Eyes erected too) How Zealously I look'd on Heav'n above, Wish'd it unkind to me if I prov'd false to Love. Have we not since, too, often sworn the same? With fresh Endearments fed th'Eternal Flame? Eternal! no, 'twas Momentary, slight, A short-liv'd Met'eor, a delusive Light, A Glare, an Ignis Fatuus of the Night; By which y'ave led me over Bush and Thorn, Drill'd on by Hope, and driven back by Scorn. Sure thou dost think thou at Loves Auction art, And dost by Inch of Candle parcel out thy Heart: Thy Flame so far from lasting, I ev'n doubt Thou dost but light it up to put it out, Or singe as purblind Moths that fly about. Destructive Sex! for as thou usest Me, So each Man's serv'd by some Perfidious She. Cruel, or false y'are all; and he is blest, He only, that excludes you from his Breast, Nor lets your Terrier LOVE, dislodge his Rest. Love! that where e'er it comes makes Concord cease, The Dearth of Pleasure, and the Bane of Peace: The Toil with which w'are hatter'd out by Day, At Night, the Hag that rides our Sleep away. Debate, Deceit, Distrust, have hence their Birth, And all beside that makes a Hell on Earth. If Courtship opens such a Scene to Strife, What Curses must there follow with a Wife? Miscellanies. On the new Edition of Godfrey of Bulloigne in 1687. Long this stupendious Work has lain obscur'd, From gloomy Times a long Eclipse endur'd; But now it rises like a cloudless Sun, And brings as great a Tyde of Glory on. Hail Heavenly Poem! while these Strains we hear, The Soul does mount into the ravish'd Ear, And knows no other Sense, but fixes there; So wond'rous are the Actions here enroll'd, And in such high harmonious Numbers told. See here you dull Translators, look with shame Upon this stately Monument of Fame; And to amaze you more, reflect how long It is since first 'twas taught the English Tongue, In what a gloomy Age 'twas brought to Light; Dark? no, our Age is Dark, and that was bright. Of all those Versions that now brightest shine, Most, Fairfax, are but Foils to set off thine. Ev'n Horace can't of too much Justice boast, His unaffected easie stile is lost; And Ogilby's the Lumber of the Stall: But thy succinct Translation does atone for all. 'Tis true, some few exploded Words we find, To which we ought not to be too unkind: For in Significance, we must allow, They're better than some new admitted now. Our Language is at best—but soon twill fail, If foreign Words licentiously prevail. Let Waller be our Standard; all beside Is travell'd Ignorance, or trifling Pride. The tow'ring British Heights who e'er wou'd reach, Must not with French emasculate our Speech For thee too Tasso, I a Wreath wou'd twine, Of my low Strain cou'd reach the Praise of thine. Homer came first, and much to him is due, Virgil, the next, does claim our Wonder too, And the third Place must be conferr'd on you: Thy Work is thro' with the same Spirit fir'd, Will last as long and be as much admir'd. If lofty Verse undaunted Thoughts inspire, And fill the Hero's Blood with Martial Fire; May the Lorrain. Great Chief that does the Turk engage (The Ornament and Safety of his Age) May He a (Scourge to Infidels unblest) Take Pattern by the Warriour here exprest; And drive, like him, with an avenging Hand, Those Unbelievers from the sacred Land; Free the Great Sepulchre of CHRIST once more, And be what mighty Godfrey was before! To Philip Ayres Esq; On his Poems and Translations, &amp;c. The sacred Wreath of Bays is worn by few, Scarce in a hundred Years by One, or Two, Yet from that Hope we must not banish You; You who so well, and with so just a Wing, Of Love and the bright Charms of Beauty sing. Thy Version does th'Originals refine, Oft rough in those, but always smooth in thine. To thee the Languages so well are known, We may with Justice call 'em all thy Own: At Madrid, Paris, Portugal, or Rome, Thou art as true a Native as at Home. Had you at Babel been, and but allow Y'ad understood the Tongues as well as now, In that Confusion (sole Interpreter) Y'ad stop't the monst'rous Din, and Chatt'ring War; The Noble Work a new y'ad made 'em ply, And rais'd th'Immortal Structure to the Sky! Ah Friend! It grieves me that at such a Time, When all that's learn'd and just is thought a Crime, You shou'd be Doom'd to the hard Fate of Rhime: So strangely Partial are our Authors grown, That nothing scapes their Spite but what's their own. This Work of thine that well deserves to live, And have what Praise judicious Men can give, Must not, tho' nicely Written, hope to be From their invet'rate, lawless Censure free. On thy own Modesty they'll cry y'are split; Judging of thee by what themselves have writ, And thinking Vertue ne'er produces Wit. But rest secure, and scorn their feeble Rage; Such Writers are but Mete'ors of their Age, That fall, and soon Extinguish on the Stage: Only remember'd while the Stench remains, Their Fame of no more durance than their Gains. In spite of Vice thou shalt be Vertue's boast, When Shoals of such are in Oblivion lost. PROLOGUE, Design'd for my Play of the Rival Sisters. Of Poets living poorly oft you tell, But you may wonder how they live so well: How many of you does there daily sit, Trick't like my Ladies Monkey in the Pit, That wou'd be Poorer—if you liv'd by Wit? Not that the Poets have so vast a Store, But they might very well dispence with more— And yet they please—the Barrenness of Sense Is made out to 'em in their Impudence: No Trophies to the Meek, or Just they raise, But Fool and Knave they overwhelm with Praise: They feed on Flatt'ry, and it keeps 'em Strong; So Maggots get best Nutriment in Dung. These are the things our wretched Poets do, Yet most of you wou'd be thought Poets too. There hardly was an Age e're known before Vertue was less in Use and Verses more. Nobles and Peasants, equally Possest, Write, and 'tis hard to tell which writes the best; For, when examin'd, we are sure to see But little Reason and much Ribaldrie. Nay ev'n the Women of this Rhiming Age Are oft inspir'd with like Poetick Rage; If any vain, lewd, loose-writ thing you see, You may be sure the Author is a She. The Lawyer too does verify amain, But falls by Starts to his own Trade again; For Knav'ry, their belov'd and fertile Clime, Is far more difficult to leave than Rhime: Once of that Tribe, you can be just no more; They're thorow tainted, rotten to the Core. The Flutt'ring Spark that has lov'd Cloris long, As his last Hope, attacks her with a Song; And with ten whining Verses charms her more Than with ten thousand whining Words before: Songs will prevail what ever Planet rules, For that vain Sex is still most kind to Fools. Thus all the choicest Coxcombs you can cull, Do but pretend to Wit by being Dull. Our Author, by this Rhiming Fiend possest, Does put in for a Fool among the rest: For Fools e'er now, he says, have written Plays, Nay further—Fools have had the best Third Days: He therefore begs (and he'll desire no more) Shew him the Favour they had heretofore— He'd fain be thought a Fool upon that Score. EPITAPH, On Mrs. Jane Roderick. To mould'ring Stone our Memories to trust Is to be soon forgot;—'Tis Dust to Dust. We well cou'd praise thee wou'd those Praises last, But where's the Epitaphs of Ages past? Tho' thy good Deeds in Adamant were wrote, With all the Life of Wit and Strength of Thought, 'Twere yet in vain;—or Fire, or Time consumes, And tumbles down our Temples on our Tombs. If we wou'd have thy Vertues still in Sight, We must on Paper, not on Marble, write; Some happy Genious draw thy Image there: My meaner Lines will serve to perish here. EPITAPH, On Mrs. Mary Alexander, in Broad-Somerford Church. She left us Young; yet her short Span of Life Shew'd a good Daughter, Mother, Friend, and Wife. Her Parents found her an obedient Child, Her Children tender, and her Husband mild, So Mild! his Will she never did reprove; One half Submission, t'other half was Love, To all obliging, pitious of the Poor; Sparing of Speech, but liberal of her Store. Thus true Religion her whole Life did sway: Ah! why so vertuous and so short her Stay! Others may run a longer Race of Days, But who will leave us such a Theme for Praise! Reflections on the Life and Death of a certain Miser. He's gone!—but not a Tear was shed To grieve him, Sick; or mourn him, Dead: And that the Reader by our Rhimes May view his Fate, and shun his Crimes. In ruthless Verse we'll far and wide, The Good to please and Bad to guide, Tell how the Caytiff liv'd and dy'd. There are a sort of Men, we know, That will be Drunk, yet stingy too; And tho' they guzzle more than any, The Reck'ning call'd, won't pay a Penny: (If Covetous in Drink, no doubt They're cursed Covetous without) His Sire was one of these, and in That Humour got this Man of Sin; Who, tho' by Nature born a Sot, Was never known to pay his Shot; But as he further Maudlin grew, The sturdier wou'd with-hold his due: Fast in his Fist he'd clinch his Coin, Not Flesh and Bone cou'd closer join: If to be broken on the Wheel, You'd there be sure to find it still. So we of Indian Dogs are told; Who when they once had fix'd their Hold, Tho' all their Limbs were lopp'd away, They'd neither flinch, or quit their Prey; But in the Pangs of Death were found Fast set, and cleaving to the Wound. Wielding of Birch was first his Trade, And wild Tyrannick Work he made: But Mony there did rise but faint, And that he had resolv'd his Saint; For whose dear Sake he vow'd to do What ever Avarice prompt him to. Puts on a Cassock next—but there He mov'd not in his Proper Sphere; As being confident in Nonsense, And of Impenetrable Conscience: Wou'd swallow Contradiction still, Just as a Leacher does his Pill: For which, and Works alike Devout, The CHURCH did cast his Nusance out. Last turns an Usurer, and then From Teaching falls to cheating Men. Here his own Talent came in Play, Use, Mortgage, Principal, Pay-Day, Was all we e're cou'd hear him say. His very Prayers (if e'er he pray'd) In the set Forms of Bonds were made; And Noverint Universi rather He wou'd begin with than Our Father. Thro' Breach of Promise, close Deceits, False dated Bonds, and open Cheats; Thro' Orphans Groans, and Widows Tears, The bitter Bans of Ruin'd Heirs; (For following Gain he wou'd not stop For all Salvation bids us Hope.) Thro' these, and we to these may join All Laws both Human and Divine, He waded to a Mass of Coin; Almost as much as Crassus had; But Crassus got not his so bad. Abroad a Glutton; ev'ry Feast He'd curse where he was not a Guest: To see him slash, and gnaw, and tear, And brandish his keen Blade, you'd swear Milo the hungry Churl were there; And eating up that very Ox He with his Fist fell'd at a Box; So fast he ply'd it—with a Pox. Then for the Liquor, let him swill He scarce wou'd take Damnation ill: The full Pint Glasses, as he got 'em, He took sheer off and shew'd the Bottom: His Lungs were breath'd like a Smith's Pair Of Bellows, and wou'd hold more Air. When quite top-full towards Home he'd rowl, And use his Body like his Soul; For he Compassion had for neither, As by the Consequence you'll gather. At home he was so strangely scraping, This Topick there is no escaping, His Servants (and he ne'er kept any Whom he designed to pay a Penny; Tho' sometimes he was forc'd to do't, Because the Law did goad him to't) Look't all like Pharaoh's meagre Kine, That did the seven Years Dearth divine, E'en Rats and Mice, free of the Nation, Who by their Charter choose their Station, Instinctively, by all Relation, Had fled the hungry Habitation. So very slender was his Fare, If the old Cameleons had been there, H'ad starv'd 'em tho' they liv'd on Air. Thus He (who at another's Table Wou'd Gormandize as long as able; And, when 'twas at a Neighbour's Cost, Spare neither bak'd or boil'd, or roast) At home a Life much needier led, Than the starv'd Wretch that begs his Bread: In spite of all his Bags of Gold His Paunch was lean, his Back was cold. 'Twas to this Usage that at Length, He sacrific'd his Health and Strength. Cramps, Aches, Dropsy, Gout and Stone, He was by all attended on; Man shunn'd his Company, but they In fatal Complaisance did stay, Assiduous to his dying Day. Yet nor his Misery nor Years, That daily did augment his Cares, Cou'd make him settle his Affairs: Of all his Hours (run out so ill) He'd spare not one to make his Will; But left entailed upon his Heirs Chancery Suits for many Years: Extortion always has the Lot For Fools to spend what Knaves have got. To what is said we'll add but this; His Life and Death were of a Piece: His Life foretold what Death he'd die, His Death fulfill'd the Prophecy. For no Remembrance of Offence, No gracious Thought of Penitence Did kindly interpose between His fatal Sickness and his Sin. Unmindful of pale Death, that now Appear'd triumphant on his Brow, He glar'd around, resign'd to Fate, And past th'inevitable Gate. Perhaps, by some, 'twill here be said We're too invective on the Dead; In the same Grave their Ills shou'd ly Their Failings with their Bodies die. But give the Scripture Place which still In Death it self reviles the Ill; And left 'em chronicl'd that all May see their Fate and shun their Fall: And that being what is here design'd, A fair Construction ought to find: To represent such odious Crimes May be Instruction to the Times, And point us to a better End; Tho' e'en to Him Grace may extend; For tho' his Fau'ts all Bounds outflew, Mercy, we know, is boundless too. Advice to a Friend in Distress. When w'are by Craft or haughty Pow'r opprest, Of all the Vertues Patience then is best: Happy the Man when Crosses come whose Mind Is calm, and to th'Eternal Will resign'd: Hold up that Shield, in vain will Envy throw Her Darts, while we are just we ward the Blow; Swifter than Shot the Shaft does back rebound, And meant to others gives herself the Wound. Whenever caught in a litigious Snare, To flounce and strive but keeps us longer there; Malice may of our Rage Advantage get But arm'd with Patience y'are above Defeat: You baffle thus the Slave with small ado, That has been drudging Years to injure you. Tho' in his Rage a thousand Oaths did rise, And every Oath back't with a thousand Lyes, Which still he swallow'd, as his Pills he did, And five went down at once they were so glib: Can such a perjur'd Profligate as this Have a worse Conscience? Can that speak him Peace? Can that wrong'd Inmate be so thro'ly fear'd That Heav'ns not lov'd, and Hell it self not fear'd? No, no; there's none in Vice so flaming bold, But, are, in Conscience, of those Vices told: It gives 'em oft a Gripe of future Fear, And tho' that's Dismal, yet it stops not there, For long Impenitence may bring Despair. That bold Solicitor will move your Cause, And never wait the Leisure of the Laws; (The Laws! from which w'are often forc'd to fly For Refuge to the Court of Equity; And there for Equity we wait so long, That Law it self is yet a cheaper Wrong.) She'll try it in his Breast, and there, in spite Of his Design to wrong you, do you Right. Murder too oft is but Man-slaughter found, But 'tis not so the Murderer heals his Wound; Conscience, unless well satisfy'd she be, Will fright him worse than Tyburn's Gallow-Tree. To this Tormentor let the Tool be left; Who loves not Peace will be of Peace bereft: While you enjoy that Halcyon-State of Mind, Which he without Repentance ne'er must find: Tho' there's a visible Injustice seen, Yet what you lose without, you gain within. Let then his Passions, Anger, Lust and Pride, By turns his Whore-exhausted Body ride. Nor think him mending when you hear him say, I'm but Subordinate and must obey; For Heav'n will his Excuse ill understand, That says—I was a Rascal by Command. While in that Path he lets his Interest go, The Lord above is left for one below. Yet while he thus Inveterately pursues Your Ruin, only that y'ave Wealth to lose, To our Good Saviour's Lesson have regard; Love those that hate you—true, the Task is hard— But what's too much when Heav'n is the Reward? To Julian Secretary to the Muses. A Consolatory Epistle in his Confinement. When those, my Friend, we Love are in distress, Kind Verse may Comfort, tho' it can't redress: Nor can I think but you'll my Zeal commend, Since Poetry has been so much thy Friend: On that y'ave liv'd and flourish'd all your Time; Nay more, maintain'd a Family with Rhime. And that's a Mark which Dr?den ne'er cou'd hit, So much his Pension's better than his Wit. Ev'n Gentle George (with Flux in Tongue and Purse) In shunning one Snare run into a worse. Want once may be reliev'd in a Man's Life, But who can be reliev'd that has a Wife? Ot?y can scarce his Corps from Gaol preserve, For tho' he's very fat he's like to starve. And sing-song Dr?fy plac'd beneath Abuses, Lives by his Impudence and not the Muses. Poor Cr????n, too, has his Third Days mixt with Gall, He lives so ill he hardly lives at all! Shad?l and St?le, who pretend to Reason, Tho' paid so well for scribb'ling Doggrel Treason, Must now expect a very barren Season; But chiefly He that made his Recantation; For Villains thrive best in their own Vocation. Nay Lee in Bedlam now sees better Days Than in his madder Time of writing Plays: He knows no Care, nor feels sharp Want no more, A Blessing he cou'd never boast before. Thus while our Bards e'en famish by their Wit, Thou, who hast none at all, dost thrive by it. Wer't possible that Wit cou'd turn a Penny, Poets wou'd then grow rich as well as any. First, 'tis not Wit to have a great Estate, (The blind Effects of Fortune and of Fate;) For oft we see a Coxcomb, vile and vain, Brim full of Cash, yet empty in the Brain. Nor is it Wit that makes the Lawyer prize A bawling Life, but Knav'ry in Disguise, To pluck down honest Men that he may rise. Nor is it Wit that does our Quacks advance, (Those of your English Spawn, or those from France) But pois'ning by Design—for Curing comes by Chance. Nor is it Wit that makes the Tradesman Great, 'Tis the Compendious Art to Lye and Cheat. Nor is it Wit for Burgess, Lobb and Pen, (Those worst of Teachers to the worst of Men) To think by getting Rich, to grow Divine; For where's the Saint if you with-hold the Coin? Nor is it Wit to be in Scarlet drest; To Wisdom, Grief; to Policy, a Jest. Life in our King's, or Country's just Defence We all shou'd stake; but does it rise from thence That Colour's Courage, or that Oaths are Sense? Or that th'Impartial Satyr shou'd not grin To see such Herds behind the Lion's Skin? Nor is it Wit that drills the Statesman on To wast the Sweets of Life, so quickly gone, In toiling for Estates; then like a Sot, Leave Luxury to devour what Knavery got. Nor is it Wit for Whigs to scribble Satyrs, No more than for their Patriots to be Traytors; For Wit does never bring a Man to hanging; That goes no further than a Rose-street Banging: How justly then dost thou our Praise deserve, That got thy Bread where all Men else wou'd starve? And, what's more strange, the Miracle was wrought By him that han't the least Pretence to Thought: And he that had no Meaning to do wrong, Can't suffer, sure, for his No-meaning long: And that's the Consolation now I bring; Thou art too dull to think a treach'rous Thing, And 'tis the thoughtful Traytor that offends his KING. To a Friend in Wales, on his Neglect of writing to me. Forgot by him so truly I regard, Forgive me if I think my Fortune hard: What have I done offensive, or unkind, Thus to be raz'd for ever from your Mind? A Mind in which I'd rather far reside, Than in the Noblest Seat of Human Pride: Let building Fops pretend a Deathless Name, To gain but thy Applause is ampler Fame. Kanvair, what ever it might seem to thee, Thou there, was like th'Elizian Fields to me. Tho' Storms did rise, and tho' loud Torrents roll'd, And I cou'd only Steril Rocks behold, Steep ragged Cliffs, that seem to touch the Skies, From which Mankind with Horrour turn their Eyes; Thy Converse chang'd this Scene of wild affright, And turn'd that very Horrour to Delight. How pleas'd was I thy Nuptial Choice to hear! Joy on, I cry'd! Joy fix for ever there! I wish'd, but thought not the Result wou'd be A long, unkind Forgetfulness of me: Much Favour to her Share I knew wou'd fall, But thought not you'd so vainly part with all: Such Lavishness ev'n I must discommend, For you may love her well—yet love your Friend; And from her Kisses, tho' they are Divine, Spare time in three long Months to write a Line. Write then, and quickly, least it shou'd be said, That, as you among Ruthless Rocks were bred, Thou, too, dost in their flinty Nature share; And deaf, like them, to Friendship and to Prayer. What ever Fate's reserv'd for me and mine, 'Twou'd Comfort be, if by a welcome Line; I am assur'd 'tis well with Thee and Thine. To my Lord Chamberlain at Bath. This healing Stream, this Æsculapian spring, That from all Parts does such a Confluence bring, Of Lame and Blind, of Sound and Sick and Sore, Of Knave and Fool, and worse, of Baud and Whore; Tho' Wonders it is sometimes said to do, Does yet confine those Wonders to a few: Yet vainly all expect to have a Share, The Rotten wou'd be sound, the Foul be fair; The wrinkled Beldam wou'd new Pleasure prove, And, like a Punk of Twenty, chatters Love. The stale debilitated Lover here Expects Relief, and gazing on the Fair, Feels Heat return; but 'tis so false a Fire, It never reaches further than Desire. How madly does that Man his Hours employ That still does wish and never can enjoy? That past the Fact, is yet not past the Fau't, And damns himself by being lewd in Thought? Then for the Coxcombs (not to name their Cloaths, Their Dancing, Raffling, Drinking, Noise and Oaths) Their Treats and Entertainments make it plain, They come alike to be reliev'd in vain. It never was presum'd that bathing yet Reform'd a Fool, and made him grow a Wit. Tho' Thousands have been eas'd of Cramps and Pains, Of Palsies, Itches, Botches, Scurfs and Blains, If fails when the Distemper's in the Brains. But tho' the Fops are thus deceiv'd we find The fruitful Stream to youthful Ladies kind; Who with their open Breasts and swimming Bowls, (As others Angle Gudgeons) fish for Fools; Here still at Hand, and careless of their Fate, You'll find a Hundred biting at a Bait: And oft indeed, the Bait is not so small, But there's enough to satisfy 'em all. This for the Glory of the WATER makes, Which hence it's kind prolifick Nature takes. Oft has the Lady (her good Man at Home, Invoking Heav'n to unseal her steril Womb) Here first conceiv'd; then to her Husband flown With hast, to keep the Theft from being known, While he thought all was well, and all his own. A Fortnights time in reck'ning breaks no Squares, Or, if it shou'd, 'twere a bad Day for Heirs. But now some Lady, that's ador'd the most, Is chosen out to be that Morning's Toast: For her the Musick plays; the Health's go round The Toast! the Toast!—and stun us with the sound: She all the while, kind Nymph, the Gallery plies, And with admiring meets admiring Eyes; Proud of the Honour thus to rule the Roast She swims along the Bath—the Toast, the Toast! Pity they wou'd not one step higher go, And drink the Liquor it was soakt in too. Who wou'd comply with such a nauseous Fashion, And rather not, with Lear, call out in Passion For Civit to refresh the Imagination? But while my Mind thus freely I express, I have forgot to whom I make Address. Pardon, my Lord, that thus I entertain Your Ears with things ridiculous and vain, And idly tread the Satyr's thorny Ways, When Dorset was so just a Theme for Praise. To Mr. Giles Frost. How often have I wisht my self with You, Walking the Fields and sporting with the Swains? Or from high Grounds the happy Streams to view That so enrich, and so adorn the Plains? Where true Content, so very seldom found, (If any where) Eternally does dwell; And Nature does with Endless Wealth abound To feast the Eye, the Ear, the Tast and smell. But Ah! reserv'd for some more rigid Fate, I'm doom'd to a perpetual Bondage here, Just in the Bosom of a murmuring State, Where Rage and Tumult deafen all the Air. The Greatest Storms are soonest overpast, They do but make a Visit and away; But here the Rack Eternally does last, Without the least abatement, Night or Day. If we cou'd mount among the flashing Clouds When Thunder does with greatest Fury rave, Compar'd with London, they were Peaceful Shrouds, Still as a Calm, and silent as the Grave. Nor wonder at it; Murder, Schism, Debate, Treach'ry, Revenge, with num'rous Mischiefs more, Make a more loud Report than anger'd Fate When Winds below, and Heav'n above does roar. Yet, Friend, this Comfort in the Storm I find; Tho' Oaks around me from the Root are Rent, By being Low I'm cover'd from the Wind: There's none so safe as He that's Innocent. To the much Honoured Gilbert Gerrard-Cosen Esq; on the Report of his being Dead. When to my Ears the Dismal Tydings flew, And my own Fears had made me think 'em true, A silent Sorrow on my Soul did seize, And fill'd my Breast with such sad Thoughts as these. Ah! why shou'd Mortal Man on Life depend, Which once, and none can tell how soon, must end? Ev'en He, but now so healthy, and so gay, Chearful as April's Sun, and fresh as May, Whom ev'ry Grace adorn'd and doated on, In the full bloom of Life is dead and gone! Cropt from the Stalk! the vernal Sweets decay'd! So flourish't Jonah's Gourd and so did fade! Nor cou'd that Loss th'Impatient Prophet bear, He beat his Breast, and griev'd ev'n to Despair: Ah! how can I then mourn enough for thee, Who always wer't a Jonah's Gourd to me, A shelter from the Storms of Poverty? Yet Witness Heav'n it is not only Gain, The Loss of so much Worth I most complain. Honour he priz'd, and has this Honour gain'd, 'Twas ne'er by an Ignoble Action stain'd. Nor was his Wit of a less Sterling Coin, He ow'd it not to Blasphemy, or Wine. Ah! why, ye Pow'rs! why was his Morn so bright, If you design'd so soon to banish Light, And bring on Gloomy Death and Endless Night! But Lo! as thus I did indulge my Grief, The happy News arriv'd that gave Relief. A gust of Joy ran thro' each Vital Part, Flam'd in my Eyes, and revel'd in my Heart! He lives! I cry'd, die those that wish Him ill, He lives! the Great Young Man is with us still: He lives! that Word shall dwell upon my Tongue, He lives! shall be the Burden of my Song! He lives!—and 'tis my Prayer he may live long. In Answer to a Copy of Verses of Major Coleman's; whom I fail'd to meet according to Promise. All I can here in my Defence pretend Will ill excuse neglecting of a Friend. 'Tis true, a great Man, that I ought t'Obey, Laid his Commands, and did exact my Stay; Had you been there y'ad been with-held like me, And I, perhaps, had now been blaming Thee: For Shadows, thus the Substance we neglect, For Friendship shou'd take place before Respect. In all his Grandeur I cou'd nothing see That Recompenc'd my disappointing Thee: And yet I'm pleas'd—for happy was th'Offence That did discover thy new Mines of Sense: More to be valu'd (by thy Judgment wrought Wing'd with thy Fancy, polish't by thy Thought) Than the rich Metal from the Indies brought. Had I been fau'tless you had never Writ, My want of Vertue gave the World thy Wit. But O! thy Muse that chides me yet betrays; Sparing of Blame, but liberal in her Praise: Like a strong Wine the fume does upward drive, And Overpow'rs the Spirits 'twou'd revive. To thee 'tis rather due; whose happier Fate Is soon to gain what we ev'n miss of late. Early, and with a first Essay, thou hast All we have done, or e'er shall do, surpast: Caught, like Elijah, from our wond'ring Eyes; If from low Themes thou thus can'st reach the Skies, From loftier Subjects whither wou'dst thou rise? Ne'er did the Generous Muses yet afford Such Credit to the Man that broke his Word: If by such Methods we can compass Fame, How easy 'tis to get a deathless Name? While with our Errors thou can'st Charm the Sight, (For Praise, tho' undeserv'd, does give Delight) We shall be fau'ty that thou still may'st write. And yet 'tis certain Praise is often writ (Whate'er the Writers say) to show the Writers Wit, To Honour others tho' they seem to aim, The chief Design's their own peculiar Fame: When humble things sublimely they express, And the Deform'd put in a Beauteous Dress, It proves their Art;—thus if my Verses shine, 'Tis with the Radiance that is shed from thine: So from the Sun, in it's own Essence bright, The Moon's pale Orb has her Precarious Light! You bask in open Day, and I am hid in Night! Thy Brows with Lawrel bound; I Joy on Thine To see that Wreath that wou'd but fade on Mine: There let it rest, and with unwithe'ring Pride, And an unless'ning Green, th'attacks of Time deride. Mean while, my Friend, You must allow me this! That Sorrow past augments the coming Bliss. The rising Sun wou'd not appear so bright, Were he not hid with intervening Night; By Darkness made a more Illust'rious Light. Thus, failing once (since both were then perplext) Will make our Pleasure more Substantial next. Fond Lovers so after long Partings meet, And mix delay to make the Blessing sweet. But there the Parallel will hardly hold, For Love's a Warmth that still resigns to Cold: But Wine and Wit will yield us Nobler Game, And only Friendship is a Deathless Flame. To Charles Duncomb Esq, On his Enlargement. Nor shall the Bells alone the Tydings tell, But on that Theme consenting Laureats dwell: All Sounds beside have but a dying blast, But Notes the Muses strike for ever last. Nor do they only give the Hero Fame, When in high Flights they reach th'Æthereal Frame, But oft descend, and sport with humbler Game; In our Domestick Grief and Pleasure share, Revive our Hope, and silence ev'ry Care. At once Resistless, yet at once so Mild, We find our Anguish eas'd, our Rage beguil'd: Thro' all the Passions they the Soul conduct, Like Beauty charm, and like a God instruct. Yet see their Fate, and with what causeless Rage They're trampl'd on by a Licentious Age; Contempt and Scorn is all their Followers get, So vain 'tis to be good, so dang'rous to have Wit. 'Tis true, too oft aspiring Insolence Does take the Chair, prescribing Laws to Sense: Bold Sycophants that vend Adulte'rate Writ, And, praising Vice, profane the Name of Wit. That they may Honours to themselves procure, Pull down the Barriers to Despotick Pow'r: By base and servile wresting of the Text, They're Flatt'rers first, and State Projectors next. The Free-born Muse in nobler Toil delights, Nor gives a Poets Name to Parasites. Not so the Ancient Bards employ'd their Zeal, To plot and ravage on the Common Weal; With beardless Counsels pushing Slav'ery on, Nor private laught at publick Mischiefs done; Gave no Applause where Merit was not giv'n, Nor screw'd up proud Prerogative to Heav'n. Ah! Sidney, and thou greater Rawleigh rise, Hold the just Mirror to Britannia's Eyes, Or with the Muses FREEDOM finds her Doom, Like Pompey with the LIBERTIES of Rome. But how can Verse escape when Worth like yours (While such preside) ev'n Law so ill secures? Nor that, your Wit, Experience, or Estate, Cou'd save you from their Legislative Hate. Rather by these, so eminently high, You stood the more conspicuous to their Eye, For Envy hates to see Prosperitie. In Sanguine Seasons such their Harvest make, Like Ahab kill, and then Possession take: Men that by Fortune's Caprice madly rise Bold with Success, and but at Random wise, Ground keen by Ava'rice, we but vainly lay Right, Reason, Law, or Gospel in their Way. They cut thro' all, to Grandeur heedless drive, Yet to the Point that they propose arrive: While cooler Heads, that sigh for Albion's Fate, Wonder to see such Rashness steer the State. Ev'n vast Assemblies take from them their Bent, And those that chose 'em truely represent. But 'tis impossible their Luck shou'd last; Already we may see their Total Cast, And present Time look frowning on the Past. As Milo riving Oaks, was made at length A Sacrifice to rash advent'rous Strength; So he like Ruin on his Head will draw That rends, Despotically Kings from Law: They once will meet, the Peoples Suff'rings seen, And crush the Audacious Ministers between. Such were the Men who their dark Snares did pitch; And you must be Obnoxious—as y'are Rich; Tho' Twenty Years (enough to prove Thee just) You well discharg'd an Honourable Trust. In thy Pursuit we might their Rancour find, For Blood how did the deep-mouth'd Beagles wind? No other Business cou'd their Thoughts beguile, So pleas'd to think they had you in the Toil. The Gene'ral Hunt was up, the Sky in Storms, And Falshood, Proteus-like, shew'd all her Forms: Seiz'd, Cast, Confin'd; so thick the Torrent fell, It was half Treason but to wish Thee well. Thus to the grinning Mob they gave your Name. Aspers'd with all th'Opprobrious Terms of Shame. The utmost Odiums were upon Thee thrown, Worse than your Foes cou'd wish, or Spite wou'd own. What in this Lab'rinth but a Hand Divine Cou'd guide you, and convey the Clue to thine! Prest with a Weight that wou'd have Atlas bent, You broke thro' all, approv'd and Innocent. Ah! who but You (tho' Truth can much perform) Cou'd e'er have thought to weather out the Storm! Or who but the Castalian Sisters did So far see forward, among Causes hid, As to be confident in that Extreme, Thy SAFETY once wou'd be their noble Theme? They saw thy Innocence wou'd be too weak The Snares of thy Confed'rate Foes to break: What was her Strength such active Spite t'engage? Or what her Mildness to so bold a Rage? They Saw how Friendship here wou'd interpose. They saw it too victorious in the Close: With your Defence that did its Forces join, Secure, when Peterborough's VOTE was thine: Who wou'd but HE with dang'rous Pow'r contend, And grapple with such odds, to save a Friend? But for that Pilot on the Rock y'ad split, Brought to the Port by his unweari'd Wit. His Eloquence this Admiration draws, That yet he never spoke but gain'd the Cause. This noble Action shall preserve his Name, And thine retrieving, give his own to Fame; Where with illustrious Rays it long shall shine, The Glory HIS, but the Advantage Thine: But in this Place, O Duncomb! joyn with Me, And aid the Muse as HE has aided thee: Give her Directions how to tune her Voice, And reach a Subject Truth hath made her Choice. Tell in what Strains his Valour shou'd be writ, And how I must expatiate on his Wit: Thou thy rich Thoughts can'st vary several Ways, Yet never want Materials for his Praise: Shew how his secret Vertues I may find, And dive to the Recesses of his Mind; Where the bright Seeds of Worth a quick'ning lie, That look so lovely and that soar so high; That to the World I may unclose the Scene, And suit my Verse to the Immortal Theme. Next to our View his beaut'ous Consort bring, To sing of her that can so sweetly sing; Whose tuneful Voice all other Musick makes An unharmonious Sound when e'er she speaks. But here the Work no more thy Aid requires, For who can't write when such a Form inspires! What ever Good can of her Sex be shewn In Theory or Practice all's her own: Sweet as the Blasts that in Arabia bear Their wond'rous Odours thro' the Spicy Air Where e'er she goes the Fragrance fixes there. Modest as Blushes that from Children flow E'er they th'Intent of diff'rent Sexes know. Her Wit can conquer every thing it meets, Yet like the Bee, it only preys on Sweets; Without ill Nature, easily 'tis born, You see the Rose and need not fear the Thorn. Her ev'ry Grace, her ev'ry Action charms, Like Joy it pleases! and like Life it warms! O only blest! O only happy HE That does possess what w'are so rapt to see! Forgive me, Sir, that I so long digress; But who that honours Beauty cou'd do less? 'Tis hard to think on that Illustrious Pair, And not to fix our Contemplation there: If you your self on such a Theme wou'd stray, You'll pardon me for losing of my Way. To my Lord of Dorset on his Installment. My Lord, In this most honour'd List of Fame We have expected long to find your Name: This Star upon your Ancestors did shine, And Buckhurst shall transmit it to his Line; Nor bring your Titles to their View, But make your Worth hereditary too. Others may need a Prop to buoy their Praise And feed the Fame a false Applause does raise; In vain—the Courtier can't the Coward hide, Their Courage proves false Metal when 'tis try'd, Allegiance, Flatt'ry; and their Honour, Pride. But YOU in such Illustrious Paths have trod As differ scarce the Hero from the God: Nothing (but meerly human) e'er has yet At once been first in Worth, and first in Wit, At least, till Dorset liv'd and Dorset writ. Never till our third Edward's Days from Heav'n Was such a Spur to Emulation giv'n: What see we like it thro' all Ages past? Or what so likely thro' all Times to last? HONOUR, the Hero's shining Prize, does here In such a sweet, yet noble Shape appear; Were conquer'd Nations added to our Isle, This bright Reward outbids the Blood and Toil. The famous Patron of this Order who (Tho' granting all the Legends of him true) In after times will be less fam'd than You; (For what's a Monster conquer'd in his Rage To your restoring the Virgilian Age, Honour to COURTS, and Vertue to the STAGE) Ev'n He at Your Installment shou'd rejoice; At once the People's Love and Prince's Choice. What may we hope from HIM whom all agree Worthy of Marks that honour Royalty? The KING, 'tis true, the Favour does confer, Nor is it less when Kingdoms do concur. This Roll, full of the like in Worth and Name, May cure the French King's Tympany of Fame, When in those Fields the Hero's shall appear Who this illustrious BADGE of England wear, And WILLIAM, chief of the GREAT ORDER there; Not Comets hung from Heav'n with fatal Hair, Can bode more swift Destruction, Plague and War: Then British Swords will in French Blood be dy'd, And great Belshazzar tumble from his Pride. To the Right Reverend Father in God Gilbert, Lord Bishop of Sarum. Tho' I can add no Glory to your Name, Yet praising YOU, I may arrive at Fame, By your Applause a deathless Mem'ry get; For Gratitude should last as long as Wit. 'Tis that, my Lord, Occasions this Address; So few the Grateful none shou'd wish 'em less; Or blame the Muse to Celebrate his Name, And give him Praise that gives the Nation Fame. To those Productions who can be severe, In whose Composure Flatt'ry has no Share? Where there is no Design but just to give To Worth its due, and pray that Worth may live? How many are there that much better know To pay you Praise, with hold the Debt they owe? In Learnings Empire, tho' they vastly get, Return no Tribute to your soveraign Wit? Take then my Mite, my Offe'ring, tho' but small; Ev'n GOD accepts of Little—when 'tis All. But O what Language can th'unletter'd find T'adorn so vast, and just Extensive Mind! What can I hope on this great Theme t'indite, Where the most learn'd must with Despondence write! See then your Goodness first; which vast must be, Since it assures the Muse 'twill reach to me, And not a well intended Homage slight, Which, coming from the Heart; may hope 'tis Right. Thus Heav'n who has whole My'riads Igno'rant made, Seems yet to make that Ignorance their Aid; To them he opens his Eternal Doors, While the much better Learn'd he less assures: Perplext with Doubts, thro' tedious Tomes they run, Which but advance the Ills those Doubts begun! The Crowd believes, and half their Work is done. To those you condescend and Precepts fit; For want of which Peculiar varying Wit; So many stiff Instructers daily split. Strange! they shou'd think t'advance the Christian Good, By taking Pains not to be understood! Let Writers use a rich, or tow'ring Strain, The Teacher must be Earnest, clear and plain. But then, tho' here you half your Lustre shroud, It is but as the Sun behind a Cloud, Who breaking forth does double Brightness bear; So when in Publick Confe'rence you appear You shine Entire—the Learn'd are Learners there. How have I seen the List'ning Clergy stand, While thro' their Ears you did their Souls command, Their Ardour at each Period flaming higher? For ev'ry Word you spoke you did Inspire! As when we travel thro' some spacious Plain, Adorn'd with Pastures, and replete with Grain; There lowing Herds walk t'ward the Mur'muring Rills, And here the Bee her wond'rous Balm distills: So does your Lang'uage to the Vulgar show, When you Expatiate on those Points they know; Rich where Y'are plain, and Flow'ry where Y'are low. But as from thence to lofty Hills we rise, Where new and nobler Scenes salute our Eyes; If there some Chosen-Guide direct us too, Amaz'd and pleas'd, we distant Regions view: So to this Audience you sublimely Soar, Lost to their Sight to whom You spoke before: Thro' Mysteries Myst'erious ways You get, Up to the top-most Round of Human Wit; A Height that Reason scarcely e're acquir'd, Or Learning yet has compass'd, uninspir'd! Nor yet alone to these the Path you shew, But to contending Casuists hold the Clue. The Schismatick himself may here have aid, Lost in the very Laby'rinths they have made; And Secta'rists stray because their Teachers stray'd: But reading YOU we find the Danger o'er, They can't deceive th'Unwary as before; Conviction lies all Radiant in their Way: There is no wand'ring in so bright a Day! Where er'e we look new Wonders Strike our Eyes, This Section gives us Wonder, this Surprize. You no where scorch us with a fiery Zeal, Yet there's a Warmth that ev'ry Soul must feel; Something that Elevates our Thoughts, and finds, Like Light'ning, Entrance to the Rockiest Minds. Then Eloquence thro' all the Mass does run, Like Nature animated by the Sun; And, like the Sun's, it's Force does ne'er decay, The same to Morrow as it was to Day; This always flowing, as that always bright, Your Sense no more Exhausted than his Light. As when the Spring her Riches does unfold, And a New Nature rises from the Old, With Joy our Eyes behold her Beauteous Face, And own her Offspring of Celestial Race: So does your Stile the English Tongue refine, Makes a New Glory round it's Visage shine, And Stamps Conviction that the Work's Divine. There lies that Purity of Phrase we prize, And, like a Charm, it there to save us lies: Seeking for Elegance we Wiser grow, And with the Honey take the Pect'ral too: So sweetn'd Potions we to Children give, They drink deceiv'd, and so deceiv'd they live. Thus every Way your Zeal our Good contrives; Nor only fines our Language, but our Lives: Like Paul unweary'd Diligence bestow, Confirming, too, the Churches as You go; Ah! that as then the Christian Seed wou'd grow! But Precepts nor Examples now have Force T'arrest our Sins in their destructive Course. Each Cent'ry does in Vice transcend the Past; Too sad an Instance this may be the last. No Times succeeding can our Present match, Or Plot on Plot with such dark Rancour hatch. Nor Kings alone, we e'en our God defame, Revile his Priests, and brand the sacred Name. Pity 'tis now Your Turn such Crimes t'engage, And yet but fit—what less can check their Rage? Good Prelates are reserv'd for the most impious Age: Impending Plagues their Prayer does oft remove, And wrest it's Veng'ance from the Arm above. Be then what still y'have been; exert your Worth, Call all your Piety, your Vertues forth: Let every other Mitre with you join; And weeping Albion further your Design: Let ev'n our Sov'raign too like Ardor feel; Heav'ns Ear is open when good Princes kneel. Who knows but, if such Incense reach the Skies, These sinking Nations yet again shou'd rise, And with our Sins o'ercome our Enemies: We can't expect a less Stupendous thing Shou'd from the Prayers and joint Petitions spring Of such a CLERGY, and of such a KING. Occasional Verses To several Ladies, &amp;c. Advice to a fine young Lady. Y're now, O Cloris! on the Publick Stage, Live in ill Times, and a Censorious Age; Lovely as Young, and Vertuous as y're Fair; As great your Merit, great must be your Care: Be strict if you'd have Reputation stay, The least Neglect throws the Rich Gem away. Th'Hesperian Fruit, tho' by a Dragon kept, Was by a bold Hand gather'd while he slept. The more your Lustre, it the more gives Light To the sharp Darts of Prejudice and Spite To take their fatal Aim, and hit the White. Beside, alas! tho' ev'ry Woman's frail, The Loveliest are most liable to fail: If Fruit we choose, we take the Fairest first, The rest goes down, but not with such a Gust; Think of Lucretia, then of Tarquin's Lust. Or if like brutal Violence can't prevail To work your Ruin, Flatt'ry will not fail; But ah! beware the smooth enchanting Tale: You know the Truth; the Snake's beneath the Flow'r; Avoid the Tongue, and you avoid its Pow'r. Let ev'n the Good with Caution be believ'd, For he that much does trust is much deceiv'd; And an ill Name's prevented easier than retriev'd. But who, you'll say, can scape Detraction's Sting That wounds up from the Vassal to the King? Nothing is free from its unlicens'd Rage; The Hope of Youth, nor Reverence of Age. Shou'd Angels, as of old, from Heav'n come down T'Instruct, as then to scourge a Lustful Town, Ill Tongues wou'd find 'em in that fau'tless Shape, Nor cou'd their Heav'n-born Purity escape. O Cloris! granting this Objection true, It more enforces what I'd have you do: If Infamy delights the Good to blame, For were all Ill, the Ill wou'd have no Shame, You can't with too much Niceness guard your Fame; That to secure shou'd all your Thoughts employ, Hard to preserve, and easie to destroy. Vertue, tho' ne'er so pure, may sully'd be, She's made, or marr'd by Credibility; Tost like a Ship, Opinion fills her Sails, And they all slacken as Opinion fails; That is the sterling Stamp that makes her go, For you are Vertuous if we think you so. Strive then t'improve our least obliging Thought; Applause, uncultivated, comes to nought, And Glory ne'er was found unless 'twas sought. Not but I know when Clouds as thick as Night Obscure the Sun, he, in himself, is bright, Breaks thro' the Gloom at last, and yields unless'ning Light: And Vertue, tho' opprest, at length may rise, And with it's chearful Glories gild the Skies; The Slander and the Slanderer flit away, And drive like Mists before the Lord of Day. But do not let this Caution be forgot!— 'Tis not the best that have the happiest Lot: The Greatest Chastity can least have Right; In vain it wou'd maintain the unequal Fight Against Ill Nature, Envy, Wit and Spite. Think not to be secur'd by Pow'r, or Place, A Matchless Beauty, or Illustrious Race; No Human Fortune is above Disgrace. The World the Good it hears with Doubt receives, The Ill it credits once for ever it believes. Be sure you think not of your self too well! Strive to be Good, but silently excell. On her own Name she but an Odium draws, Tho' ne'er so vertuous, that expects Applause. If we a Voyage take (as Life is here No other, but more difficult to steer) Is it not far more pleasing to be free From Rocks and Sands, and Heav'ns Inclemencie; That no rough Waves shou'd roll, no Wind shou'd blow, But all be still above, and smooth below, Till we have made the Port in Harbour lie, And there, at rest, their baffl'd Rage defie; Than like th'Athenian Tyrant heretofore, (His Sea-Diversion) leave the safer Shore To toss in Storms, and hear the Billows roar? To be more plain;—had we not better live, And take th'Esteem a Grudging World will give, Let Life glide gently on, an Even Stream, Free from ill Tongues, and ev'ry wild Extreme, Till to the Grave we go, and there enjoy That long Repose Detraction can't destroy? Were it not wiser thus, than by fond Ways Proud of our Worth, pull down what we wou'd raise, By an Immoderate Itch of Senseless Praise? For Vertu'ous we may be, but when Respect, We therefore claim, it dwindles to Neglect; A Justifying Pride we all reject: Let then a Lowly Mind be your Delight, Nor by too pert a Censure 'waken Spite; A Mad-Dog if not hooted may not bite. But above all Religion be Your Care; Your Words, Thoughts, Actions, all shou'd Centre there: It must not be with a Light Air receiv'd, For then as lightly it will be believ'd; The Great Deceit is to be Self-deceiv'd. What Arguments so e'er some Men may bring To make it seem a sowr unlovely thing, When once Embrac'd, You'll find it has more Charms Than Love or Wealth, or Pow'r can usher to your Arms. Yet have a Care;—for, to our lasting Shame, All's not Religion that assumes the Name: 'Tis not a Theo'ry warm, and Practice cold; Or Legends very false, and very old, Such as the Essence of all Truth destroys, And only fit for Chimney-talk for Boys: Nor yet that Zeal that does our Sect'rists sway, Who damn all those that disbelieve their Way, When w'ave a thousand Proofs they go astray. In some 'tis Int'rest, and in some 'tis Pride; Hypocrisy, or Prejudice their Guide, How soon are Truth and Reason laid aside! And yet who more among the Rout does rule Than a sly Knave, or an Enthusiast Fool? This, whining to the Mob in Maudlin Cant, And That, all Noise and Fustian, Foam and Rant. Alas! Truth lies not in Fanatick Spite, Socinian Smoothness, or the Quakers Fright. That's true Religion that does make you strive To love your Neighbour, and the Poor relieve; To do no Wrong, nor at no Wrong connive, And all the Wrong that's done, you to forgive. The Moral Parts no more, the Mystick this;— If thus you Act, you can't believe amiss. Now, Fair One, let me this Request obtain; That these Instructions you wou'd not disdain, Because they're told you in a homely Strain: A soft and melting Stile may please your Youth, But happy! if y'are better pleas'd with Truth: Not but I know your Conduct has been try'd, And none e'er liv'd that needed less—a Guide. To a Gentlewoman who had written many fine Things, and not seen Mrs. Phillips's Poems. Orinda's Sacred Works to You I send, Not doubting but You'll prove her lasting Friend: Accept, and lay her to Your Breast; You'll find She's Entertainment for the Noblest Mind; And to your Sex this Deathless Honour brings, That you can soonest reach the loftiest Things. Her Verses and her Vertuous Life declare, 'Tis not Your only Glory to be Fair. How can you fail to Conquer, when the Darts Are double pointed that You throw at Hearts? Wing'd by your Eyes and guided by your Wit, What Mark so distant they can fail to hit? Darkness in vain wou'd interpose between, With these Advantages you wound unseen. But by what Magick has her Heav'nly Song Lain from thy knowing View conceal'd so long? When not the Sun, who is the God of Wit, Makes more unweary'd Searches after it. Great Shakespear, Fletcher, Denham, Waller, Ben, Cowley, and all th'Immortal tuneful Men, Y'ave made your own; and none can better tell Where they are low, and where they most excell; Can reach their Heights when e'er y'are pleas'd to write, Soaring a Pitch that dazles Human Sight. But O! when you have read this matchless Book, And from its Excellence a Judgment took, What the fair Sex was then, how will you mourn To see how justly now they're branded with our Scorn? Farces and Songs obscene, remote from Wit, (Such as our Sappho to Lisander writ) Employs their Time—so far th'Abuse prevails, Their Verses are as vitious as their Tails: Both are expos'd alike to publick View, And both of 'em have their Admirers too: Tho' which is least was ne'er distinguish'd yet, The Writer's Vertue, or the Reader's Wit. With just Disdain behold these heinous Crimes, And with thy chast Example fix the Times: Right the wrong'd Age, redeem thy Sex from Shame, 'Twas so Orinda got her Deathless Name: Thou art as Fair, hast the like Skill in Song, And all that thou dost write will last as long. To Madam B. occasion'd by a Copy of Verses of my Lady Ann Baynton's. As when the Blest up to their Heav'n are gone, And put their fadeless Wreaths of Lawrel on: How are they pleas'd to hear their Vertues there Made Angels Songs, that met Reproaches here? No less amaz'd, nor less with Rapture fraught, Rais'd above Earth with the exalted Thought, I stood, to hear my Praise, contemn'd by Men, Employ the Beauteous Adorissa's Pen! All that we merit we but think our Due, So but bare Satisfaction can ensue; And Blessings hop'd for half the Bliss destroy, For, oft, the Expectation palls the Joy; But when unthought of, undeserv'd they come, They give us Transport, and they strike it home: So she, like Heav'n, does her Rewards impart, Which fly beyond the Bounds of all Desert. I now may boast I have Eternity; For, sure, what she does write can never die: Her Beauty may, perhaps, to Time submit, But Time must fall a Trophy to her Wit. Beneath her Shelter a low Shrub I lie, And, safe entrench'd, the Envious Men defy; While, like the Mountain Cedar, she surveys The Plain, and whom she please does crown with Bays: They cannot reach to her, nor dare reject (To her high Worth preserving their Respect) What she has deign'd to like, and to protect. But while her Wit is in our Praises shown, Why is she so forgetful of her own? Why Honour others, and neglect the Claim To her undoubted Right, Immortal Fame? 'Tis therefore, Fair one, that these Lines you see, That on this Subject you may join with me: You can both write, and judge of what is writ, A Priestess of the Mysteries of Wit: Tho' her own Worth refuses to comply, And clips the Wings with which her Praise shou'd fly, We so far may reject her Modesty; We shou'd, howe'er, attempt to do her Right; The Subject will instruct us to indite. Does not her Eyes, which we with Joy behold, Transcend Fictitious Goddesses of old? Her Form so Noble, and so sweet her Air, That gazing once we fix for ever there! Her Smile, like Transport, ev'ry Care controuls, And finds a quicker Passage to our Souls. She wounds, we bleed; and dying, bless our Fate; So much she pities what she's forc'd to hate. With Joy and with Despair at once we strive, Her Honour kills us, and her Eyes revive. But ah! so far above our Reach she flies, We only upward look with longing Eyes, And must not, cannot, dare no higher rise. Just with such Looks was the rich Miser seen, When he view'd Heav'n—and the broad Gulf between, Her Vertue gives to Love no smallest Scope, But blasts, and quite annihilates our Hope. Yet Matchless tho' her Beauty be, her Smile Is not more sweet and lively than her Stile. Her Eyes themselves have not more melting Charms, And ev'n her Love not more Divinely warms; When drest in all the Sweets of blooming Youth, Adorning mighty Love with Mightier Truth, She does to Damon's eager wishes hast, With equal Warmth embracing and embrac't. Well did the Swain deserve so great a Good, Who in the Bud the Flower understood, And knew to what Advantage 'twou'd be shown When Spring was come, and all it's Graces blown. Here we shou'd all her other Gifts declare, For of all else she has as large a Share: But O! what Pen, or Pencil can we find Able to paint the Brightness of her Mind! Which, open'd to our View, diffuses round A Flood of Lustre that does Sight confound; Forces the Muse her airy Flight to stay, VVhich here must stop, or else must lose it's VVay. So when from Heav'n, and brighter than the Sun, A sudden Glory round th'Apostle shon, Too much Refulgence did oppress his Sight, And he fell blind amid'st the Blaze of Light. To a very Vertuous Gentlewoman, on her being traduc'd, &amp;c. Defend us from Reproach is, sure, a Prayer We often ought to use, that Heav'n may hear: When e'er the Devil wou'd exert his Skill, And, as supreme in Hell, be so in Ill, He glides into some black Detractor's Ear, His first Essay and sheds his Poison there: Possest of that he next secures the Heart; And then the Tongue, that does th'Abuse impart, He points and makes each Word a Scythian Dart. Scandals too false and sinful to be nam'd, Are whisper'd first for Truths, and then for Truths proclaim'd. In Friends this does the Breach of Trust create, And sowing deep the Seeds of dire Debate, Pity to Spite, and Love resolves to Hate. Strife, Bloodshed, and almost all Ills on Earth From this accursed Fountain draw their Breath. What Mischief did there ever reach our Ears That a malicious Villain don't or dares? What Libyan Armour, or Vulcanian Shield (Tho' ne'er so much as dinted in the Field) Can save us from th'invisible Attack Of Slander? or, approaching, drive her back? Where ever Breath can Entrance find she comes, Nor so contented, tears up Marble Tombs; What close Recess can hide us from her Power, When the cold Grave can't its own Dead secure? What Guard ye Powers! from such a Shaft as this, That flies so swift and certain not to miss! Not Love or Fate can scarce take surer Aim Than a flagitious Tongue, that shoots at Fame: To be gay, youthful, vertu'ous chast and fair, But make their Owners more obnoxious there. Against this conqu'ring Evil what Defence? O what!—is Patience best, or Innocence? Or are they both, arm'd each by each, the thing That from this deadly Hornet plucks the Sting? These, sure, (if any Heav'nly Gifts of Force T'arrest this Bolt in its destructive Course) Sure these are Proof (against all human Wrong, And e'en the worst of all,—An Envious Tongue! Quit then, fair Mourner, these Destructive Fears, Afflict our Souls no longer with Your Tears: Free from all Ills those Vertues can resist, Tho' ever aim'd at You'd be ever mist: Off from those Shields they turn, with fierce intent, Like Shafts recoiling, when there's Treach'ry meant, Back on the Sender with Destruction sent. Your Fau'tless Life (tho' but at Noon arriv'd, But thro' more Good than Thousands longer liv'd) Will better plead, and more exalt your Praise, Than Envy's worst Invectives can debase. As Guilty Ghosts, when first the Cock does crow, Fly at the Summons to their Den below; So all Reports with which we'd brand your Fame Vanish like them, repeating but your Name: Envy in others does her Ends obtain But her Attempt your Matchless Worth to stain, Was the first Work she e'er advanc'd in vain. Yet, while our Thoughts we on this Theme impart, Who knows but that your Conduct is your Art? The Glorious Sun, behind thick Clouds retir'd, (For what's not seen does cease to be admir'd) Seems lost to us while they possess the Air; Not that He's less in Glory, not seen here, But that, perhaps, he lists not to appear; As knowing that his Warmth with-held, and Light, Will more endear him than if always bright: At his own Choice he can exert his Ray, But without Darkness who wou'd prize the Day? So, tho' your black Aspersor basely drew A Gloomy Scene between our Eyes and you, Your shining VVorth the Shade does circumvent; Remaining veil'd but by your own Consent: Discreetly, so, to make our VVonder more; That, breaking forth, we might afresh adore, Confirm'd in all the Good we thought before. VVhat Reason then to grieve at his Offence That sought to bring your Goodness in Suspence? Let him, to his Confusion, now perceive No Vitious Habit in your Breast can live, And that the worst Affronts you can forgive. Not stung with Spight, or raging for Abuse, VVho knows what your Example may produce! Thus his Conversion may be wrought by you, And your be'ng vertu'ous make him vertu'ous too: How can his clear Conviction be withstood, That finds his Evil still producing Good? He will not, dare not, cannot go astray, That sees you thus persisting in the VVay. VVho then wou'd rush with Passion on the Shelves VVhen Patience Saves ev'n Others and our Selves?— But daring to Instruct You I'm too bold; Tho' few your Years, in Prudence you are old, And know how to be Good without be'ng told. To Madam L. Fair is your Sex, but ah! so faithless, they Indeed deserve what we in Satyr say: But some among the rest, a very few, Like Dia'monds in the Dust, attract our View: Among which Number, sparkling like a Star, Elate, you shine, and spread your Lustre far. Ah noble Maid! but in thy Age's Noon, And make Perfection all your Own so soon! Shewing thy Sex (and ah! that more wou'd please To trace thy Steps) they may be Good with ease; That Vertue's not a Scare-Crow to affright, But soft as kind'ling Love, and mild as op'ning Light. 'Tis true, our Teachers with their wayward Looks, And doz'd with poring on too Rigid Books, Say 'tis a Blessing none cou'd ever gain Without an Age of Patience, Toil and Pain; But why shou'd they make rough, what you have made so Plain? While of such strong Impediments they tell, They fright the striving Few from doing well; And clog their Thoughts; which else wou'd light-some fly, Led on by yours, and reach the ample Sky. 'Tis granted that Temptations will abound, But whom seduce?—The Sickly, not the Sound: Gold shines in vain, in vain Ambition sings, To one that does contemplate nobler Things; That sees the Goal, and with a sober Pace (For some run fast and tire) keeps on and wins the Race. Ill Fare the rigid Dame, and wrinkl'd Face, (As far from Common Sense, as Sin from Grace) That says none can be Wise, or Chast, but those That whine and cant, and snuffle in the Nose, And wear, by Choice, unfashionable Cloaths: But decent Ornament, tho' such abase, Instead of a Reproof commands our Praise. Why shou'd that Lady be thought vain, or proud, That loves to be distinguish'd from the Crowd? The Crowd (not Sin shou'd be avoided more) Those two-leg'd Bruits, more senseless than the Four. Yet that a Mean shou'd be observ'd is true, And 'tis as sure that Mean's observ'd by few. The Woman shou'd not like her Lady dress, (She may let her Impertinence be less;) Nor Drabs of the Exchange, of base Report, Be trick't like a fine Beauty of the Court. In Quality there's many things allow'd Which in a meaner State is being Proud; Tho' oft in Quality it self we see A strange Corruption of this Liberty. Extravagance in Dress is the Abuse, And that, in no Degree, admits excuse. The senseless City Spouse does most affect That costly Wear the better bred reject; Such will have rich Attire; and when 'tis done, They're aukwardly and flantingly put on. Just as a Coward's known by Bullying Oaths, So is the City Wife by tawdry Cloaths: Or if in those her Folly is not seen, 'Tis open'd in her Breeding and her Mien. This Mushroom Race will still the Ladies hate, And yet while they revile they Imitate; But ne'er can reach the soft and conqu'ring Air, The easy flowing which attends the Fair That have been nobly born, and train'd with Care: In Youth th'Impression took, the Charms abide, So there 'tis Nature, and in these 'tis Pride. 'Tis not a Town, or Court, tho' Daily seen, That forms a just and an accomplish'd Mien; The Bright'ning Seed must first within take Root, Before it can produce the shining Fruit. To hear these Cits on Quality declaim, You'd think great Ladies had no Sense of Shame; So filthily they daub a noble Name. And yet, forsooth, (so senseless is their Pride) With Madam they must all be dignify'd: Rak'd from the Country, and the Stench of Stews, When e'er they're spoke to we must Madam use: Their pratt'ling Children must lay Mammy by, And answer in the Stile of Quality. This Publick Grievance is not strange, or new, Nor is it only Practis'd by a few; The Vice is gen'ral, and the Measure's full, Ev'n from the Merchant's Spouse down to the Porter's Trull. A Thousand like Examples we may find: But thou art to the happy Mean inclin'd, Ev'n in thy Outward Dress we see thy inmost Mind: So full of Modesty it dazles Sight, And renders thee our Wonder and Delight: Fine, and yet flowing; as there had no Care Been us'd in Dressing; then thy easie Air (Neither too stiff, nor, which is worse, too free, But just what true Deportment ought to be) Mixt with thy pleasing Converse, is a Charm That more than Joy allures, and more than Life does warm! Happy for VVomankind, as happy too For us, were all your Beauteous Sex like you; VVou'd they Behaviour from thy Pattern learn, Dress well, but make the Soul their chief Concern. But ah! Mankind wou'd then too happy be; And Heav'n has shew'd us, in creating thee, Such VVorth's a thing we must but seldom see: For, unlike thee, most of your Sex we find Not made to Pleasure, but to Plague Mankind. Vain are our Youth to let you then so long Thus single live—but 'tis themselves they wrong: Or rather you're unkind, and will not take Th'Addresses which, without Dispute, they make: For they have Hearts Impression to receive, And you have Eyes to conquer and enslave. Yes! yes! I see 'em at your Foot-stool kneel, I hear 'em sigh, and with a Pang reveal That Love they did with greater Pangs conceal! O don't persist thus cruel!—but encline To Pity; Love's a Passion all Divine: Make some one Happy, and reward his Care; And ease the rest by giving 'em Despair. To the Happy Mother. Whether we with thy Virgin State begin, A State to that of Angel next of kin; (Not that in Goodness thou art alter'd since, For all thy Life's one State of Innocence;) Ev'n there we such a modest Sweetness see, As none can have that Copy not from thee: Never were any of the Virgin Train, So Fair as thee, so far from being vain. Whether we take thee in that Scene of Life, That made Hamilcar happy in a Wife: Or whether next (for Joy but Grief precedes) We see thee Mourning in thy Sable Weeds: At once to your dear Husband's Mem'ry kind, And to the fatal VVill of Heav'n resign'd: No Plaints we heard, and no Repining saw; Yet all your Servants treated with that awe, VVe well perceiv'd that Noble Flame of thine, Extinct with him was never more to shine: That one, and only one, was e'er to prove That more than Mortal Blessing of thy Love. VVell may that Matron from the Gene'ral Voice Meet gene'ral Praise that makes no second Choice; It shews the Ardour of her first Desire Survives her Loss, and upward does aspire To meet her Consort in the Courts above, VVhere the whole Scene is Everlasting Love! Love suited to the long Embrace of Souls; Not clogg'd, as here, with vain Fantastick Rules. In all these Stations, thro' th'Entangling Maze, You still have trod the Path that leads to Praise: VVhether a Virgin, VVife, or VVidow found, Fame with her clearest Blast your VVorth does sound: Pleas'd with the Theme, we all encline an Ear, And with an Eager Transport crowd to hear: 'Tis then, both profited and charm'd we find VVhat VVonders may be said of VVomankind. And yet our Admiration stops not here, But to a Nobler Call invites the Ear: Wife, Virgin, Widow, Honour'd o'er and o'er, VVe yet must praise thee as a MOTHER more. Not Lemuel was instructed with that Care And Prudence thy three vertuous Daughters are; Nor with that Zeal did, in so short a time, To Praise, to Honour, and Perfection climb: Their Fau'tless Lives, and their unspotted Fame, Shew that from thee their Education came. Thy Eldest has already Copy'd forth The Noble Scheme of thy Immortal VVorth; Her Soul the same; like thine still tow'ring higher, Touch'd with a Coal of the Celestial Fire. Happy those Virgins that are Vertu'ous Young! For Vertue's least attain'd by living long: Age makes our Frailties into Habits grow, Evil, and when we'd cease from being so, Like fam'd Alcide's Shirt, our Vice so fast Does cleave, it tears away the Flesh at last; We sigh and grieve to leave our Favo'rite Sins, And 'tis with Sorrow that our Joy begins. VVhile they that in their Youth become Devout, Tread but that Path in which they first set out: Thy Pious Daughter thus her Race began, And half Perfection has already ran. Some Ladies nothing talk, yet take it all; No VVord that e'er she speaks does idly fall. Books her Delight, Religion all her Thought; Heav'n must be found with so much Ardour sought. VVhile other Nymphs of Husband talk, and VVife, (Which is indeed of Nonsense and of Strife) Her Heav'nly Study is a Holy Life: Not that her Beauty wants those Flames and Darts That charm the Lovers Eyes, and wound their Hearts. But from this Mirrour, where all Maids may see, By what She is, what they their selves shou'd be, Thy Elder Hope, we next descend to Her That Marriage did to single Life prefer: Belov'd, and loving, she has took her Fate, And is an Honour to the Sacred State: She Honours that, and does her Husband bless With all that wisest Men call Happiness. A Face and Form that all Mankind admire, But then so chast as blasts all vain Desire, And quench as fast as Love renews the Fire. Prest in her Snowy Arms, from him we know That there's (indeed!) a Paradise below: By a yet closer Tye than Marriage joyn'd; Not only one in Flesh, but one in Mind. High in their Orbs to faut'less Joys they go, And scorn the distant Rack that rolls below; Where Wedlock-Strifes a fearful Prospect form, Confusion, Fury, Fright, all driving on the Storm: From whose rude Breast those Flames and Bolts are hurl'd, That scatter such Cumbustion thro' the World; And, like the murde'ring Angel heretofore Of Egypt's First-born, knock at ev'ry Door. But they, in Love's bright Goshen, free from fear, See all around 'em Halcion, still, and clear; The swift and wide Destroyer comes not there: For them, ye Pow'rs! your Blessings we implore Let Plenty clip 'em round with all her Store, Safety attend behind, and Truth lead on before; Till, having ran thro' a long Train of Years, They're rais'd to Heav'n unknown to Human Cares. Two Daughters such as these may well assure The World y'are happy, if you had no more: But O thy Youngest does new Matter raise Both for our Admiration, and our Praise! Here Beauty does in all it's Pomp appear, But comes and sees, and settles Conquest there! Humbles the Proud, and makes the Wise adore, And reaches to the Soul thro' ev'ry Pore! As when before some earnest Saint at Prayer, An Angel all in Glory does appear, O'ercome with Rapture and the Blaze of Light, He for a while does lose his Sense and Sight, Sunk in the Boundless Ocean of Delight! So when the bright Serapha's in our view, We know not where we are! or what we do! Her Beauties almost Beatifick too! Such is her Form; but when her Voice we hear. W' are lost anew, and find fresh Magick there! Or when she does in Art full Measures move, There's a new Scene for Wonder and for Love! We bleed! we burn! and rush upon our Fate, Resolv'd to die, if she resolves to Hate! Pardon this Rapture!—but when we'd express Serapha's Beauties how can it be less? She that is all the Lover e'er admir'd, And all that Poets Praise when they're inspir'd! Hail HAPPY MOTHER!—and be blest the Womb From which this fair Triumviri did come! If Beauty, Truth, or Piety can give Their Owners Fame, their Names shall ever Live, And Thine with theirs! from that they took their Aim, And by Example follow'd THEE to Fame: For tho' they might have Vanity withstood, And seem by Choice, and Inclination, Good, They ne'er had been to such Perfection brought, Had they not seen YOU Practice what you Taught. To my Lady Long: With my Poem on the Death of the Queen Enclos'd. Madam, Th' Enclos'd does humbly court your View, Lines doubly happy, if approv'd by YOU. Accept 'em for Her sake of whom they Treat, And for Your Own, in whom like Wonders meet. She's gone, alas! who long we hop'd wou'd Reign; Nor cou'd w' enough condole, enough complain Were it not some amends that You Remain. In Youth the same your Shape, your Face and Mien, And at Your Age she wou'd the same have been; She only differ'd from You as a QUEEN. Fate in Her Death by a bold Stroke does show, Not sparing Princes, Subjects too must go: At Peace, she now has reach'd her Native Home. But late, Ah; late may your Removal come. 'Tis true, like her, 'twou'd be your Gain to go; But what wou'd then become of those below? Where after that wou'd Vertue have Regard? The Poor, Relief? or Poetry, Reward? To my Lady Ann Baynton on the 28th of April, her Birth-Day. 'Twas Night, and with a Weight of Grief opprest, Tho' weary'd with much Toil, I took no Rest: All wrapt in Melancholy thought I lay, Wish'd 'twou'd be ever Dark, or soon be Day. But Heav'n, that looks into the Inmost Grief, A Lucky Thought inspir'd, and gave Relief; A Thought that all around did Joy display, And drove the Anxious Throng of Cares away. So oft, in Vision, Fancy to us brings A thousand frightful Images of Things, Confus'd; but at the op'ning of the Eye Their Shapes dissolve, the Airy Fantoms fly. Gods! (strait I cry'd) why lie I longer here? And, Pleasure smiling, thus Indulge my Care? Up then, and to high Heav'n Devotion pay For the Return of this Auspicious Day; The Day that gave fair ADORISSA Birth, And with another LUCRECE blest the Earth: Chast ADORISSA, first in Truth's Esteem, The Grace's Darling, and the MUSES Theme; Which ev'ry Pen to write, and ev'ry Ear With an uncommon Joy inclines to hear: While in her Conduct we see fairly writ Her Mother's Heav'nly Modesty, her Father's Pow'rful Wit. As thus I spoke, Aurora's cheerful Ray Brought the glad Tidings of Returning Day; The Larks, in Air, their Morning Carols sung; To Heav'ns wide Arch the aspiring Echo rung. And now the Sun let loose the Reins of Light, And ne'er before, methought, appear'd so bright: No Cloudy Aspect interpos'd between His Beams and us: nor rising Fog was seen: The Winds were hush'd; only a balmy Breeze, With am'rous Wings, fann'd Perfume thro' the Trees. Lo! here, cry'd I again, (when all around, Above, below, a General Joy I found) NATURE her self, to show we well admire, Puts on her Gorgeous Robes and Spring Attire, That we may say her gentlest Looks she cast To Grace this Day, and bless it as it past. Never, O Goddess! did thy Favours shine Yet on a Form that came so near Divine: The Sex's scatter'd Beams in her unite; There single Stars, and here a Gallaxy of Light. Her Vertues, which the nicest Test will bear, Her easy, melting, yet commanding Air; A Temper which no Trifling will abide, Sweet without Art, and stately without Pride. A Voice so tuneful! such a Nameless Grace! Such Lovely Motion! such a Lovely Face!— We can no more! The Theme the Writer fires, And he can least Describe that most admires. These, Madam, were my Thoughts;—but while you stay To read 'em, you throw precious Time away, And mar the better Pleasures of the Day: The Guests, Impatient, long you shou'd appear; And I shou'd err to keep you longer here. Now strike up Musick—let the Virgins Feet, With equal Harmony your Measures meet; In Dances let 'em give Delight the Rein, And, tir'd, take breath; then on, and tire again: But let not, Swains, your Shepherdesses fair Make you fix Adoration only there; O give not Cupid all! let Bacchus have his Share! So! to the Top fill up the flowing Bowl; Come! he that spills least has the greatest Soul: Let no dull sniv'ling Coxcomb baulk his Glass, But if he will not drink, dismiss the Ass; Ill fare the Man that, at the needful Time, Thinks Dancing, Kissing, Love, or Drink a Crime: What if they call us Sots? So let 'em do; Your sober Sot's the dullest of the two. Fill round again, to the large Brim fill up, 'Tis Adorissa's Health—unlade the Cup: But, prithee, tho' y'are Merry don't forget The Poet;—Wine's his best Pretence to Wit. But whither does the Muse intend her flight? Or has she, else, forgot to whom I write? Or am I drunk indeed? turn'd giddy with Delight? How e'er it is, Madam, I'm confident Here's nothing said, but dutifully meant: Permit me then to hope you will forgive These Lines, and condescend to let 'em live: The Poet's Friend! when e'er y'are pleas'd to smile, You wing our Fancy, and improve our Stile. Wherefore this April's Sun shall cease to warm, Your Spouse to Love, and your own Eyes to Charm; E'er I desist, Indulgent to your Fame, To sing your Praise, and celebrate your Name. Long may you in your Consort's Arms be prest With the same Ardor you at first Carest, When the dear Man came panting to your Breast: May you see many of these Days return, And, e'er the next Arrives, an HEIR to Damon born. 'Tis granted Heav'n does to the Prayer incline; Nor shall the Sun his Annual Progress shine, Before you give that Blessing to the Line. To my Lady Abingdon. If to commend and raise true Vertue high, To fix its Station in the Starry Sky, To cloath it gay, and make it flourish long, Be the best Subject for a Poet's Song; Then, Madam, I may hope you will excuse This Dutiful Presumption of the Muse: For since so far in that bright Chase y've gone, And with unweary'd Swiftness still keep on, Something we ought to your vast Merit raise; What all Mankind admire 'twere impious not to Praise. Long the Fair Sex under Reproach have lain, Too often just; disdain'd as they disdain: But you Redeem their Fame, and soar a Pitch, We first must be translated Saints to Reach. Of some bright Dames w'ave been by Poets told Whose Breasts were heaving Snow, and Hair of flowing Gold; Whose Eyes were Lights able to rule the Day, In which ten Thousand Cupid's basking lay, And on their Lips did all the Graces play; When e'er they smil'd the faded Flowers reviv'd, Encreas'd their Odours, and grew longer liv'd; Arabian Spices round their Temples flew, But their own Breath a richer Fragrance blew; The Winds to hear did all their Rage suspend, And List'ning Streams the Wond'rous Notes attend; This we thought. Fiction all;—but seeing YOU, We own 'tis possible it might be true. So finely temper'd, and so nobly form'd, With so much Goodness, so much Grace adorn'd, If ought like Angels we can see below, It is to YOU that Happiness we owe! None sees You that unwounded can retire; He knows his Error—but he must admire: Yet, tho' he Loves, he dares not hope Your Grace; Your Chastity (confin'd to one Embrace) Reprizes all the Conquests of Your Face. Had You or Greece, or Rome, adorn'd of old, What Stories had the Antique Poets told? It had been doubly then an Age of Gold: The Goddesses had (tho' in Beauty rare) No more contended which had been the Fair; But with a joynt Consent resign'd the Ball; Assur'd your Lustre wou'd Eclipse 'em all. For Mine, 'tis but the weakest Voice of Fame, But Future Times (tenacious of your Name,) With louder Notes your Vertues will proclaim: These Artless Strains (nor aiming to be higher) Serve but for Prime to give that Volley fire; When one and all your sacred Worth recite, Struck from this Darkness into Radiant Light. Blest in Your Issue! 'tis at once Your Doom To be this Ages Joy, and that to come; This, by a Grace that all the Nation warms, The next, by a Deduction of your Charms: Those Beauties then shall shine now in their Spring And the then Poets their Applauses sing; Like you, in all Exteriour Gifts compleat; Aud may (ye Gods!) their Vertues be as great. A Race of Hero's, too, that Age shall know, Who by their Deeds will their Extraction show; Add lasting Honours to the Bertie's Fame, And with fresh Lawrels crown that noble Name. Happy the Children sprung from vertuous Wives! Thrice happy they to whom that Fate arrives! The bright Example, thro' Life's wand'ring Maze, Gives 'em the faithful Clue that leads to Praise. A Vertu'ous Wife!—but such, alas! there's few, And in the Van your Merit places You. A Vertu'ous Wife! which who can e'er attain, Has got the chiefest Good, the richest Gain; No greater Blessing can the Gods bestow When they'd oblige a Favourite below. A Vertu'ous Wife! which Heav'n and Earth regards, And Heav'n and Earth, too bounteously rewards; For in both Worlds the highest Fate she'll share, Below Immortal Praise, Immortal Glory there! To my Lady Peterborow on her saying she did not like Panegyrick. The Royal Bard, and best that ever writ, Whose Hymns are us'd in our Devotions yet, Too coldly us'd—were Heav'n with Ardor sought, We shou'd recite 'em with that Warmth he wrote: The Thought so pure, th'Expression so Divine, Th'Inspiration glows in ev'ry Line. Ev'n He has shown when we wou'd highest raise Our Thoughts, it must be on the Wings of Praise. After God's Heart—that Glorious Title came. Nor from his Crown, but this more sacred Flame. While Praise is forming, and when Praise is giv'n, Our Minds a Correspondence hold with Heav'n: Such Contemplation purges off, the Allay From Nature, doubly Animates our Clay, And from our Souls does brush the Earth away. Nor is our Praise to those above confin'd, But does descend to the Terrestrial Kind. Where an Unusual Excellence is giv'n, In not applauding we dissent from Heav'n: Vertue and Wit are his peculiar Care; There to the Clouds the Muse her Tour shou'd rear; Nor can we, silent, gaze upon the Fair. In Waller's noble Panegyrick Strain We see that Way of Writing's not in vain: Not in her Orb Astrœa brighter shines, Than Sacharissa in his deathless Lines: When e'er he does in Praise of Beauty rise, Delight our Hearts, and Wonder fills our Eyes; Yet in his Verse we but the Shadow see; What then, what must the daz'ling Substance be? How can we such a Blaze of Glory bear, When the Reflexion is so Radiant there? Thus Beauty, but describ'd, the Soul o'erpow'rs; And, reading there, we make his Passion Ours, Take Hints from him, in Verse our Flame improve, Equal his Strain, and find Success in Love. Nor does he only blow our Am'rous Fires, But Courage to the Hero's Breast inspires; Who meeting there with some Immortal Name, Advent'rous, strives to make his own the same, And with like Ardor presses on to Fame. Your Consort hence his Emulation draws, And Nations crown his Valour with Applause: He who o'er half the Globe his Conquest stretch'd, From a like Spring his Inspiration fetch'd, Nor blame the Parallel—so Homer wrote, And by his Lesson so that Hero fought. But small Acquaintance he must hold with Fame, That has not heard of Peterborow's Name; He that the roughest Path to Honour chose, And, fearless, did despotick Pow'r oppose, When in the Land it scarce had twenty Foes; Yet then he nobly did himself acquit; His Courage no less Active than his Wit. The Man that can in Courts so much excell, In Field command, in Senate speak so well; That high in Pow'r, can yet so low descend, Wit to Reward, and the Distress'd Befriend; Tho' Envy grin, and Discontent does blame, In spite of Prejudice, is sure of Fame. In vain wou'd Vice, with her Envenom'd Tongue, Such Honour stain and Reputation wrong; Triumphant, he shall in our Annals stand The first of those that sav'd a sinking Land. To Worth, like this, the utmost Praise is due, On such a Theme Hyperbole's were true: Here Angels wou'd not our Applause condemn, Nor yet shou'd YOU, so near a Kin to them: In YOU we see all we of THEM conceive, Of You we know what we but there believe: Of that bright Race we but Idea's frame, You are the Thing, and they are but the Name. So sweet your Aspect, and so bright your Eyes, In ev'ry Look there lasting Magick lies! We gaze with Pleasure, but we stop it there; Your Beauty Love, but Vertue gives Despair. All sublunary things to Ruin hast; Wit may Remain, but how can Beauty last? In Contradiction to the Natu'ral Course, Your Charms retain their first Triumphant Force: Your Years advance, your Beauty don't decline, But last as you were not of Human Line; Your Face the same; no least decay we find; Time has gone on but left no Print behind. In this Perfection was your Form design'd, To suit with the Endowments of your Mind: Equal'd in Excellence; the Vertues here Are just proportion'd to the Graces there. To hear you speak does charm the Heart of Man Much more than all the Art of Musick can: So sweet the Accent, and the Phrase so fit, The Harmony is doubled by the Wit. Thus your own Worth, were there no other Cause, The willing Muse to this Employment draws, And shews her noblest Work's to give Applause. Dissenting from you were, I own amiss, And, bold in any other Cause but this: Your Modesty, indeed, it does proclaim Not to affect a Celebrated Name;— But then Remember, Modesty is Fame. EPISTLES From the Country. To my Lord of Abingdon at his Country House. Happy the Man that from the Town retires, And with it quits all vain and loose Desires; That, born for Peace, the Country's soft Repose Does early love, and but with Life will lose! This Man, my Lord, like You his Hours does spend, Such You began, and such You'll surely end: Peace You enjoy, and Peace around You give, Such is Your Life, and such the Shepherds live. Prudence your Mind, and Plenty fills your Board, And ev'ry Day does equal Stores afford. Thus Circulating Pleasures round You move, All Sports of River, Mountain, Field and Grove; O Pleasure but to be excell'd above! How blest am I, unworthily your Care, Call'd from the Town and plac'd in Safety here, Free from the Ills that did surround me there: The Flatte'rers Smiles, and the false Friends Embrace, (Ah why are Minds not written on the Face!) From Tradesmen's Cheats, and Blockhead's Doggrel Rhimes, Which now are grown the Grievance of the Times: To this we'll add what more our Peace does wrong, The Harlots Tail—and worse, the Lawyer's Tongue. The Lawyer, born to be a Friend to none, False to our Interest, falser to their own; For if a Future Doom their Errors wait, Where is that One will pass the Narrow Gate? The Text that says a Camel may as well Go thro' a Needle, as the Rich scape Hell, Was meant of Lawyers:—the ill-gotten Store That makes one Rich, has made three Nations Poor. Had I a thousand Sons, e'er one shou'd be A Member of that vile Societie, I'd in the Temple hang him up; nay boil His Quarters, as a Traytors are, in Oil, To fright all Future Villains from the Soil. Freed from all this, and pleas'd she now is there Where the fresh Seasons breath their vital Air, The Muse (that has in Town been long confin'd,) And doom'd to Business where she least inclin'd,) Does now again her wonted Spright resume, And with gay Feathers deck her airy Plume; Ranging the Country round for Subject where T'employ her utmost Skill, and kindliest Care, Some noble Theme! that she may tow'ring rise, And bear the Joyful Accents to the Skies. So the glad Lark after a stormy Night, (The Cloudless Morning smiling on her Flight) Prun'd for the airy Journey, tries her Wings; Then with unlessning Vigour upward springs, To Heav'n her Note she sends, or thence her Note she brings! But long she need not look, her Game's in view; Her best, her noblest, dearest Theme is YOU! Not Souldiers when they plunge into the Fight, Wish more for Conquest, or the Blind for Sight; Not Morning Brides long more for Night to prove The mutual Sweets of undissembl'd Love; Nor the Ambitious more Delight in Fame, Than she in Rural Cells to sound your Name. To bless your Choice that here set up your Rest Where Innocence and Honesty's profest. No Courtier's Promise here our Hope beguiles, No Villain's Art, or Woman's subt'ler Wiles, All Falshood, tho' she weep, or frown, or smiles. Securely here the Natives pass their Days, Securely here you meet unenvy'd Praise. Let Statesmen on their Country's Ruin rise, And Priests be only Atheists in Disguise; Let costly Whores sit at the Helm of State, Pull down our Patriots, and make Panders Great; Let flutt'ring Coxcombs lewdly wast their Days In nauseous Converse, or more nauseous Plays; Let, like Contagion, Vice the City seize, Run thro' all Sexes, Ages, and Degrees, And the Physician side with the Disease. In vain it yet your Vertue wou'd attack, You do but frown and drive the Siren back: The General Post, untainted y'ave withstood, And think it truly Noble to be truly Good. Proud of their Titles, Equipage and Cloaths, Some Men ne'er mention God but in their Oaths: Religion they believe beneath their Race, And only Poor Plebeians fit for Grace: Their Wickedness is all their Proof for Wit, And that of Honesty to keep in Debt. O Stain to Quality! O Age accurst! When the best-born are in their Practice worst. Yet such (tho' only Vertue shou'd be Great) Are trusted at the Helm, and steer the State. How strangely do these Legislators run From their own Acts? Make Laws, but practise none, Neither of those in Scripture, nor their Own. Edicts to keep the Sabbath more severe Are issu'd out, when nothing's less their Care; So much forgetting, commonly, the Day, They've miss'd the Church and driven to the Play: There lies there Main Devotion:—And yet wise They must be thought; but all their Learning Lies In Votes, Gazettes, and reading Ladies Eyes: Where if they meet with Vertue, (which is rare) They but admire that they may next ensnare. So Schismaticks on Scripture shew their Art, And Texts not for 'em wickedly pervert. But you, my Lord, more wisely place aright In Nobler Authors your sublime Delight; Authors that don't the less attract the Eye, Because their Themes are Truth and Pietie. The Writers in their Notions more abstruse, You, in their Way, to like Advantage use: These with sure Judgment and a reaching Eye You search, and into hidden Causes pry, Look Nature thro' make all their Roughness plain; And find what Men well Learn'd have sought in vain. Ah! wou'd the Atheist seriously incline, Like YOU, to ponder things that are Divine; Observe how GOD's high Wisdom does disperse His quick'ning Influe'nce thro' the Universe; How orderly Sun, Moon and Stars advance, Create the Seasons in their Various Dance, And shew their Essence not the Work of Chance; But that th'Almighty made, and is the Soul That actuates and maintains the Mighty Whole. Wou'd he but faithfully on this reflect, With just Confusion he'd his Crimes reject; And, when unprejudic'd, by Reason see In the least Spire of Grass the Deity. But such you rather pity than deride, Seduc'd by Luxu'ry, and confirm'd by Pride. To call 'em Fools they think a gross Abuse; And if they've Sense, they can have no Excuse For putting such a Gift to such an Use. Then Beasts why are we Nobler, but to know And Contemplate the Pow'r that made us so? Tho', Living, these let bold Expressions fly, Droll on a Future State, and Heav'n defy, They're sordid Cowards when they come to Die; When for that Endless Station they embark, Which Hobbs wou'd call a Leap into the Dark: The Dark, indeed! his Portion must be Night, That shuts his Eyes against so clear a Light, And laughs at Scripture that wou'd guide him Right. Happy the Man that to be Vertu'ous strives, And is prepar'd when the black Hour arrives: Ten thousand Fears he daily does eschew, That in wild Shapes the guilty Wretch pursue: His smooth pac'd Hours unmurm'ring glide away, His Troubles vanish, and his Comforts stay. Of all the Good with which Mankind is blest, That of a Conscience free from Guile is best. Thus all your Words, and all your Actions, show The Fountains Purity from whence they flow. For who the Top of Honour wou'd attain, Must ne'er do nothing mean, or lewd, or vain: How e'er that Term by Fops is understood, 'Twas Vertue first that did distinguish Blood. What signifies it tho' one boast he brings His Pedigree from Conquerours and Kings; If by ill Actions he debase his Birth, And grow the Publick Scorn, or Publick Mirth? In vain his high Descent and Ancient Stem, There is more Honour in a Dog than Him; Who taught by Instinct, and to Instinct true, The proper End he's made for does pursue: While Coxcombs ridicule Shape, Face and Mind, And will be that for which they're not design'd. Cowards in Scarf and Scarlet will appear, The Foul pursue the Favour of the Fair; Fools, that shou'd most be silent, most will prate, And your brib'd Member thinks he props the State: If to another Age like this we live, Our Property will all resolve into Prerogative. 'Tis he alone has an Intrepid Soul Whom Malice can't corrupt, or Fear controul; That makes the British Glory still his Care, It's Ornament in Peace, and Thunderbolt in War; That sternly to the Beard opposes Pride, And in all Strifes assists the Rightful Side: Flatte'ry he scorns, so never falsly smiles, No Scripture ridicules, or Church reviles: In Posts of Trust all By-Regards he hates, Nor from the Publick Misery drains Estates: Merit he does encourage all he can, His Age continues what his Youth began; This only is the Honourable Man. In this old English Path you bravely show How far a true Heroick Soul may go: And then (a Blessing we but seldom find) Your high Extractions mated to your Mind, The brighter both when with each other join'd: There's none so Great but he may Greater grow, If with his Noble Birth he's Vertuous too: Honour does then with double Glory shine, Enobl'd, and Enobling of the Line: Such Men are rais'd above the World's distrust, They will not, dare not, cannot be unjust, Nor basely side with Arbitrary Lust. Thus, Justice we in all your Actions see, Without which there were no Humanity: The Christian Name preposterously he bears, That uses his own Fellow Creatures worse that Brutes do theirs. But who can here omit (what ought to be Admir'd and Prais'd by all) your Charity? On those that love the Poor what Joys attend! But chiefly this—he makes his GOD his Friend. Who with this Vertue ever was a Slave? Or who e'er wanted the Relief he gave? Let those (ye Pow'rs!) be poor themselves that take No Care of those in Want, but rather Poorer make; Let not one Soul be softn'd with their Cries, That they may feel the Mise'ry they despise. And, to be plain, what Mercy can they e'er Expect from Heav'n that not one Debtor spare? That leave not on their naked Limbs a Thread, And from the Labou'rer force his daily Bread? Has the Rich Man a Greater GOD than they? Or can he boast he's made of finer Clay? Or will he have more Favour on the Judgment Day? 'Twas Charity redeem'd us from the Sin Which our first Parents Fall had plung'd us in; And, with the dearest Love that e'er was shown, To raise us thither, sent a SAVIOUR down; Who all that they had Lost, Regain'd:—and can We do no more at his Command that did so much for Man? But such as these who can despise, like YOU, And by the ill Example better grow; That Greatness can't corrupt, or Courts entice, Those Antick Schools of fashionable Vice; That in his Heart prefers his Country Seat, And relishes the Sweets of his Retreat; Thinks it a Blessing London cannot give, So lives, nay more, and so designs to live; Whose piercing Eye the Flatterer can't escape, Found and despis'd in his most soft'ning Shape; That Counter-weighs against an Ages Crimes, And is a good Man in the worst of Times; 'Tis there the mighty Nine their Voice shou'd raise, And to the Vaults of Heav'n resound his Praise; A long with Abingdon's the Name shou'd roll, And, driving, Echo on from Pole to Pole. Pardon, my Lord, that I have here so long Done both your Vertue and your Patience wrong: On this I have intrench'd, but blame my Fau't; Nor have describ'd the other as I ought: Yet since you condescend t'indulge the Muse, What you encourage you'll, perhaps, excuse: Kindly you still on her Endeavours smile, And with a bounte'ous Hand reward her Toil. O had I Strength to Balance my Desire, Or wou'd the God Heroick Thoughts inspire, To your high Worth a Lasting Fame I'd give— Nor shall it Die if what I write does Live. To Mr. Knight from the Country. O Knight! 'tis certain this Auspicious Soil Almost anticipates the Labou'rers Toil; The Spring, retiring, keeps it still in Sight, At distant Smiles, and never leaves it quite. Here Peace and Joy with Mutual Heart agree, And Plenty's reconcil'd to Piety. The happy Natives in firm Health appear 'Till they have weather'd out twice forty Year, Yet Live and Die without a Thought of Care. While I remain in such a Clime as this, And take full Draughts of healthy Country Bliss, I cannot but with Indignation frown At what is your Delight;—the vitious Town. The Town! which next to Heav'n you magnify; But I wou'd gladly know your Reasons why. What more can you say in that Life's Defence Than Shepherds of their State of Innocence? Where free from Envy, Vanity and Strife, They make the best of an uncertain Life. Ambition's deadly Rock they wisely shun, Where most aspiring Spirits are undone. To hoard up heaps of Wealth they little mind; 'Tis Peace and Truth they seek, and those they find. Let Fools to please their Taste confound their Store, If Nature is suffic'd, they ask no more. Their Mistresses are brown, of Sabine hue, But then, to make Amends, they're always true. Here when the Rural Nymph does chance to Wed, She comes unsully'd to the Nuptial Bed: But a new Comet sooner will appear, Than Hymen find a spotless Virgin there. Thro' your lewd Streets salt Drabs in Legions go; The Strand has ev'ry Night its Ebb and Flow. When upon Lady Tray and Ringwood wait, She but nine Days promiscu'ously will Mate; And when with Young they Venus still refuse; These hotter Females ev'ry Season use, And with big Bellies ply the Streets and Stews. To the loose City a like Fate arrives, But there the Trade lies most among the Wives. The Husbands they get Money by their Wares, The Wives are forc'd to give to put off Theirs. Demure their Look, and in their Mien precise, So under Cloak and Band the Atheist lies, And the worst Punk is she in Saints Disguise: All Possible Defences she destroys, And, like White-Powder, kills without a Noise. With thousand Oaths her Spouse his Riches gets, He boldly wins and she as boldly Setts. When e'er he wags she does her Circle run, From Park to Plays, to Treats when Play is done, The Gallant ready when the Husband's gone. Thus ill got Cash a bitter Curse bestows, With Perju'ry comes and in Adultery goes. Well but, you'll say, most Men such Drabs detest Nor are all Women wicked,—'tis confess'd. But who is always Wise? there is a Time When strictest Worth may stumble on a Crime. A thousand Arts they have t'enflame Desire, And fan the Blood to a contagious Fire. 'Tis best then to be absent from the Snare, And we can only boast of Safety here: With us that Sex from all Trepan is free; O lasting Charm of Artless Constancie! In getting Bastards half your Town's employ'd, And 'tis as certain that they're next destroy'd: No Privy's free; where they in Ordure lie, Yet sweeter than their Mothers Infamy. If such a Criminal's convicted here, It is a Theme of Horror for a Year: The sad Offender does receive her Due, Or flying hence, acts treble Guilt with You. As to her Centre Lust does thither tend, That Sourse of Vice which but with Time will end. As Ireland pois'nous Insects will not bear, So all our Filth is drain'd and empty'd there. Divide your Men, one part in Three are Slaves, The next and greatest Cuckolds, Fools and Knaves, The third a Rout of Mimicks, Rakes and Braves; The last of which, tho' they roar huff and damn, Search 'em, they're tame at Bottom as a Lamb. As who swears most is least believ'd of all, So big Words shew the Courage to be small. Wou'd these three num'rous Herds but leave their Folds, We may affirm You wou'd not meet three Souls, Three honest ones, from Charing-Cross to Paul's. It may be urg'd the Country is not free From many spreading Vices, sad to see, Particularly that of Knavery. But where's the Hand void of all evil Deeds? Or Spot of Land not liable to Weeds? Now here to root 'em out we daily strive, At London care is took to make 'em thrive; They flourish there, grow Popular and Great, That Soil is never without Knaves of State. That this is so we boldly may Express, Our late Divisions testify no less, When Loyalty was thought a Senseless thing, And he the Patriot that defam'd his King. Your Lawyers are Incorp'orate with these; A Race that, tho' they've Vice upon the Lees, Yet drain it on, and damn their Souls for Fees: Deliberately on Villany they fall, Side on all Sides, and yet are false to all. Instead of Forma Pauperis, all the Poor They peel quite bare, and make 'em suffer more Then twenty long keen Winters did before. He that deprives us with a Stab of Breath, Is kind to him that lingers us to Death. A Dearth to Plenty waits on Lawyer's Bills, Just like the Dearth of Health on Emperick's Pills. Curse 'em ye Pow'rs!—yet only curse 'em thus; Be but that Plague to them they are to us. Tho' all this be deplorable and sad, The Grievance is in other things as bad. What Shoals of Fops at Plays at Park and Court! Meer Butterflies, by Nature made in Sport; Or else for hast unfinish'd left, to show How much a Fashion warm from France can do: Running in Debt to all he all beguiles, And is but drest out of his Tradesmens Spoils: Had ev'ry one his Feather back, you'd find His Body then as naked as his Mind. Yet these are they that such Delight impart, They glide unfelt into a Female-Heart; To get whose Love much Talk and little Wit Are Charms that never fail'd a Coxcomb yet. O Foolish Sex! and struck upon the Shelves! That can like nothing but what's like themselves. Nor is this all that makes the Town our Hate; The very Drink it Self's Sophisticate: For your French Wines (and yet the Trash does please) Are grown as dang'rous as the French Disease; Stumm'd, mixt, Adulte'rate, and for nothing good But to corrupt the pure and wholsome Blood. Not that (my Friend) I hate the noble Juice If it be Right, and free from all Abuse: A Cheerful Glass makes Fancy walk as high (The Muse's Friend!) as 'twou'd without it fly. But as the Age goes now good Wine's as scarce As Truth in Friendship, or as Wit in Farce. Free from all this, and what e'er else we find That shocks the Peace and Quiet of the Mind, Supine, the Happy Rural Natives lie. In the soft Arms of kind Obscurity. Nor Death nor Poverty are by 'em fear'd, Against those worst of Ills they're still prepar'd, For a Good Conscience is the boldest Guard; And that they ever have; as wronging none, And living on that Little of their Own: And very Little is an Ample Store, To him that wisely does desire no more. More Instances might easily be shown To prove the Country Life excell'd by none! But I shall mention, at this Time, but One; One fit to Crown the rest; and that shall be Good house-keeping and Hospitalitie. The Gentry there can Dine upon a Dish, Two or three Eggs, or some small Scraps of Fish: You think they're Frugal; but 'tis all a Cheat, And this in short's the Truth of the Deceit: They spend so much on Drabs, they are not able To live up to their Birth and keep a Table. Hence You may guess how they relieve the Poor; Two or three Bones, and not a Morsel more, Which Footmen and the Dogs had pick't before: Footmen, I say, for in this Courtly Age, Tho' they want Bread they'll have an Equipage. But here 'tis seen, to their Immortal Fame, That Charity is not an Empty Name: There from your Doors you drive the famish'd Soul, And here the Needy never miss their Dole: No Man can Starve, if to the Bounty shown He adds some little Labour of his own. Consider but these Truths Impartially, And I don't doubt but you will soon comply To think as lightly of the Town as I. To Mr. R. Trowe from the Country. You that have always Greatness in your Eye, May well forget so mean a Wretch as I. I once, indeed, led a free Life like thine, And, Care removing, thought that Life Divine: But wiser now by my Misfortunes made, I leave the Glare and run into a Shade: And, like a Snail, within my Shell enclos'd, Fear not those Storms to which the Town's expos'd. Of Peace secure, the Swain at once is free From Publick Fraud and Private Enmity. With open Coffers, and my Doors unbarr'd I'm safe, when ev'en the Wealthy are not spar'd; 'Tis Poverty that keeps the strongest Guard. But tho' I thus obscurely pass my Days, I see enough for Wonder and for Praise. Th'Almighty in his Glorious Works is here At all Times no less visible than there, And as soon reach'd with Piety and Prayer. Nor does Content (with you ne'er known to stay, But make a Courtier's Visit and away) Leave us at all, like a tame Bird she feeds Out of our Hands, and with us builds and breeds: Plenty mean while thro' all the Plain resounds As Faction does in Palaces and Towns; That Soil where not alone Rebellion Springs, But is rewarded for defaming Kings. Here free from cringing to the Man of Pow'r, I Eat and Drink and Sleep just at my Hour: When Nature calls I Breakfast and I Dine, And not because the Clock strikes Twelve and Nine: And am as pleas'd with my own Frugal Board, As if I sat at Table with a Lord, And saw his gilded Laqueys round me wait, Who live like Dogs, but on the Scraps of Meat: As pleas'd as if, with an attentive Ear, I was compell'd his vain Discourse to hear, And mannerly to all he Chatters, cry True my good Lord—when ev'ry Word's a Lye. But prithee, Friend, how does it come to pass That thus Mankind shou'd deifie an Ass? That they shou'd patient hold, and list'ning sit, And put such Larded Dulness up for Wit: Why shou'd the Fools of Title and Estate, With Horns and Horse-shoes grav'd upon their Plate, (To shew their great Progenitors were some Took from the Forge, or rais'd by Cuckoldom) Have all the Talk? While it must Breeding be With Treason and Prophaneness to agree, And praise their Politicks, tho' meant to bring Confusion on their Country and their King. Let Sycophants and Slaves their Elbows ply, (The Earwigs that still hang on Qualitie) Run at their Nod, and crouch beneath their Spurn, And Drink and Fight and Pimp each in his turn; But why shou'd Men of Birth and Wit, by Ways So low and vile, their Dignity debase, And poorly bend to Fops they shou'd reject? For Merit 'tis we shou'd alone Respect. You'll say, perhaps, they're Flatte'rers made by Need, And let a Coxcomb prate so they can feed. Specious, 'tis true, but mean; and is but just Like Setting Dogs submitting for a Crust. Who wou'd not rather Spencer be that starv'd Than Jeff?s? (who has long that Fate deserv'd) This Poor but Just, a Grace e'en out of Vogue; And tother Rich, but ten times more than Rogue. Is it not better boldly to declare To the loose haughty and degen'rate Heir, That all the Plumes that glitter round his Head Are borrow'd from the Vertues of the Dead, His Honours only (tho he looks so fierce) But Streamers torn off from his Fathers Herse; That, had he been by Diligence to get His Mannors, and his Titles by his Wit, He wou'd have wanted or have begg'd his Bread, And been the Tail of Folly, not the Head. In vain they of their high Extraction boast, When we so clearly see the Strain is crost: To Honour the Reproach and the Disgrace; And slip't in by the Mothers being base, They're not so much as Bastards of the Race. But here I see you hit your Nose, and cry Hush!—you forget you talk to Quality; Rouze not a sleeping Lion; don't you hear Their Scandalum Magnatum in your Ear? I do, indeed;—and but that Privilege Must take off something of the Satyr's Edge I'd strip 'em bare, and open to your view So vile, so loose, so profligate a Crew Of Coward, Coxcomb, Fop, and Whore and Hag, You'd run from Honour as you'd fly the Plague, Or a new Rabble that as much affrights, The num'rous Skipping Fry of Modern Knights; Produc'd here by whole Cart-Loads in our Isle As Heat does Monsters from the Slime of Nile. 'Tis not as when our Maiden Soveraign sway'd; Yet who was better lov'd, and more obey'd? Profusion in Promotion she restrain'd, And Honour was not given then but Gain'd: Pimping had then to Worship no Pretence; Tho' it has been the surest Method since Villains to Titles and Estates to rear, To sit at Helm and have the Soveraign Ear. Again I'm wand'ring:—least I wander more I'll here, for thy Relief and mine, give o'er: This only adding; that tho' I must be Forgotten, yet my Memory's full of Thee, Of Thee! whose Name shall live in Verse approv'd, While Wit does last, and Honesty's belov'd. To the Reverend Mr. Francis Henery Cary, from the Country. Tho' all Afflictions that ill Fate can send Against our Peace of Mind their Batt'ery bend, We have a Refuge if we have a Freind: Permit me then, if I may dare presume To think your Breast retains for me a Room; Who not deserve that Freindship I implore, But will Endeavour to deserve it more: Permit me yet to hope your Pitying Ear, While by my Past I paint my Present Care. Complaining oft brings the sad Soul Relief, And is a kind of Sabbath to our Grief. Young, and not knowing yet my Friendless State, My Parents dy'd by a too early Fate. A Mother from me torn as soon as born, A Father e'er I knew his Loss to mourn. Industrious, Pious, Frugal still they were; But 'tis not Prudence, Vertue, Wit, or Care That always gets a Portion for the Heir. Mony is still an Antidote to Woe, For that's a Friend who ever is a Foe. Nay, which was yet a more unhappy Lot, The Little I had Learnt was soon forgot: Not carrying higher; the Foundation liad, For want of Building, sap'd, and soon decay'd: So oft in Spring the Hope of Autumn's lost With early Blites, or nipt with lagging Frost. But Nature doubly can her Loss repair In the kind Product of the following Year; But Learning blasted once no more will bear. My Youthful Years, alas! will soon be gone, And Winter (tho' 'tis distant) hastens on: The Northern Blasts of Age will quickly blow, My Head, alas! will soon be crown'd with Snow, Ev'n now it is too late for such a Plant to grow; Which ought to be well cultivated young, For Knowledge rooted deep does flourish long; But when it runs to Cavil and Dispute, Short is its Date, and Leaves are all its Fruit. Our SAVIOUR, in the Fig-Trees Doom, does shew A Curse will fall on Barren Knowledge too. Prevented thus, all that my Age might boast From Youth, had it been better taught, is lost: Else I, perhaps, the Holy Badge had born, Which is by YOU with so much Honour worn As does redeem it from the Atheist's Scorn. At least some Gainful Study I had made My Choice, nor been to various Ills betray'd. Just as the Lark does from the Hobby flee, So Man from Man in his Adversity. When plung'd in Water, if they see we swim Some Pitying Hand may pull us to the Brim; But sunk, tho' all have Skill, not one will Dive, The Hapless Wretch comes up no more alive: So when once Low, so tedious are Supplies, There's scarce a Possibility to rise. Thus, failing here, to Servitude I ran, And was a Slave long e'er I reach'd to Man: A Slave to some whose Curse was being Free, So lewdly they employ'd their Liberty. In no one Age Dependance was till now Us'd so unworthily, or sunk so low. In vain the Servant takes the utmost Care To please his Master, waiting, always bare, Expos'd to Summer Suns and Winter's piercing Air. He only Contumelious Language gives, And most to him that patiently receives: Reproaches, Curses, Scoffs are on him thrown, And all th'Excuse is—That the Brute's his own; Tho' wiser Baalam us'd not his so bad; Wiser than such, tho' duller than his Pad. Nor is this Usage only at White-Hall The Servant's Fate—the Vice extends to all, Up from the Bumkin Gentry to the Earl, As if, like Dogs, they were but made to snarl. The Ladies, too, who with their Consorts vye In all Degrees of Immorality; (In former Times but Practically so, But now sheer Atheists in their Notions too;) These, by their Birth misled, if e'er by Chance They on a Servant throw a careless Glance, 'Tis with the utmost Pride, like Fiends, ascance This score they down their Progeny instill, So Natural 'tis to use Inferiors ill. As if the Hireling were of Courser Clay, Brown Earthen Ware, and of right China they: China indeed, kept only for a Show; T'others for Use—and GOD wou'd have us so. But let this Thought upon their Conscience strike, In the great POTTER's Hand w'are all alike: In Birth and Wealth, and Power in vain their Trust, Alike they Die, alike they rot in Dust. Justice does here not poize the Balance ev'n; Riches and Honour, tho' the Gifts of Heav'n, Seem not with equal Distribution giv'n: When Pow'r does frown, or Insolence prevail, How light is Vertue in th'unequal Scale! Another State will make the Myst'ry clear; Tho' spited, spurn'd, and persecuted here, The Slave may of the Tyrant have th'Advantage there. On this rough Sea I thrice three Years was tost, Much Wrong I suffer'd, and much Time was lost: To other Peoples Wills I only liv'd; O squander'd Time! and ne'er to be retriev'd! Yet some cou'd their whole Lives thus wisely spend, And think not on the Miserable End; When stript of all, no longer fit to serve, Old and Diseas'd, they are turn'd off to starve; A Curse their past Intemperance does deserve: 'Tis then they see no Human State is worse Than Lordly Vices with a Peasant's Purse. But the main Coxcomb that my Nature loaths Is he that struts in old, cast, tawd'ry Cloaths, And makes up above half his Talk in Oaths. Set out in all his borrow'd Plumes, alas! He's but a thred-bare, sawcy, selfish Ass; To Bitch and Beau a necessary Imp; For who is a Valet and not a Pimp? Or if a Country Lord he serves, you hear Nothing but Rockwood ringing in your Ear; While with a drawling Tone, and sottish Face, The Story's always longer than the Chase. Speak Truth and Sense he knows not what y'are at, But Dog and Horse are his Eternal Chat. Bred to the Discipline of Whip and Bell; The Servile Rakehell French in this Excell, And we, as Servile, Mimick 'em too well. At last my better Fortune set me Free To tast the nobler Fruit of Liberty: But then (which was but just a kinder Fate) That Liberty was all my whole Estate. Tho' higher Converse, Nobler Mirth I met, And ev'ry Cheerful Glass inspiring Wit, MONEY, the Spring of all, was wanting yet. Upon that Hinge all human Actions move, 'Tis Peace, 'tis War, 'tis Women, Wine and Love; And were it only those it yet wou'd do; But ah! that want is want of Learning too. How many deathless Monuments of Wit Are wanting, that wou'd certainly be writ Were some poor Youths but train'd to their Deserts, Their Learning equal to their Natu'ral Parts: Had DORSET not struck up the Spark to Flame, Prior had never been a deathless Name. Among these Evils Poesie, not least, Took full Possession of my careless Breast, And did my Talk, my Thoughts and very Dreams infest; And as it serv'd old Homer heretofore, (My Fate like Homer's on no other Score) Lent me its helping Hand to keep me Poor: Not but thus far I may my Fortune prize; I saw the World, and did the World despise, Its Vices, Folies and its Vanities. What a preposte'rous! what a vast Resort Of either Sex to Park, to Plays, and Court! Cou'd the Concern of Heav'n our Ladies bring Thro' so much Dust to Church as to the Ring? Tho' if their loose Behaviour their you mark, Th'adjusting, bowing, ogling of the Spark, Their Liberties can scarce be more at Park. Then, when some Farce or Ope'ra comes abroad, (For Plays that mean Instruction they explode) The crowded Playhouse groans beneath the Load. Our Poets now steer not by Ancient Rules, Their Task's not writing just, but pleasing Fools: In Spite of Horace, Rapin, Rhimer's Laws, A strain'd unnatural Passion gets Applause: The Actor, foaming, scarce his Sense retains, His Froth the Emblem of the Poet's Brains. The Court we need not mention, ne'er to mend, When Vice there ceases Time it self must end, All Promises of Friendship here are lost, And only Pow'rful Inte'rest rules the Rost. Flutter and Nice, tho' bubbl'd ev'ry where, Have yet the Knack to bite the Biter here. But if some Royal Mistress lead the Dance, Of bad Extraction here, or worse from France, Preferment's his that gives the highest Rate, Tho' the Invete'rate Foe of Church and State. But above all who can the Lawyer bear? More fatal than a Pestilential Air: For tho' that does without Distinction seize Upon all Ages, Orders and Degrees; Tho' Truth and kneeling Beauty 'twill not spare, But Saints from Altars, Son from Sire does tear, It leaves the Land yet to the Legal Heir. These Greedier Harpies place their whole Delight In totally confounding Wrong with Right: The Ruin of whole Families contrive, And down the Stream of Time th'Injustice drive, While, by a Cruel and avoidless Fate, The Unborn Heir is robb'd of his Estate. How Peace and Truth wou'd on our Issue smile But for this Curse entail'd upon the Isle! So strangely is the Pest encreas'd of late, Our England now may dread th'Egyptian Fate: Shou'd a poor Country-Man in Term-time stand One Hour to see 'em shove along the Strand, He'd swear the Locust had o'er run the Land. How blest a Fate wou'd groaning Albion find Cou'd we but have a like Impartial Wind To sweep 'em hence, e'er Honesty's bereft Of Bread and Water—all the Fare they've left. Thus with strict Eyes I ev'ry Vice survey'd, And open to the Common Laughter laid: Tho' plac'd my self but in an humble Sphere, Yet cou'd I mark Abuses, see, and hear: Nor did an Ass appear thro' all the Town, Of Eminence to be in publick shown, But strait th'impartial Satyr made him known. The Hero that wou'd start to see a Sword, The Ass that trusted to a Courtier's Word, The Courtier that did Pimp to be a Lord; The Playhouse Strumpet's Murders and Amours, With all the Lesser Imitating Whores; On all alike she fixt her stedfast Hate, Nor spar'd an Atheist tho' he steer'd the State. But ah! at last I found in vain I writ, In vain I threw my Shafts, in vain they hit, No Reformation follow'd; ev'ry Ill The more decry'd, the more it flourish'd still. But little Honour they to Vertue give That say, like Palm, 'twill under Pressure thrive; Vice does the same; the more we wou'd Repell Its Poison, like a Toad, the more 'twill swell. Nothing on Earth's so loathsome, or so Ill, But Labours to preserve its Being still: In vain the vile are lasht, and foolish hist, All things that are their Contraries resist. Striving to mend I thus provok'd the Age; Which strait fell on me, furious to engage, With utmost Scorn and with retorted Rage. This made me from my Soul abhor the Place So gone in Error, and so lost to Grace; And oft petition'd Fate for a Remove To Country Shades—the Life the Muses love. O Heav'n! (I still wou'd cry) incline thine Ear To a long harrast Wretch's humble Pray'r Riches I do nor beg, not length of Days, Which on the Vitals of the Judgment preys; Let me not languish till my Sense decays: But long e'er second Childhood does come on End Life's prepost'rous Journey and begone. This only grant that (Master of my self) I first may tast the Country's Ease and Health, Nor longer in this hated Town abide; Where Faction, Bigottry, Prophaneness, Pride, Adult'ry, Murder, Treason, Fraud are found, And whirl a lewd fantastick endless Round. In some far distant Village let me live, A little Income let thy Bounty give, A little yet enough and not to spare; For as the Cash encreases, so the Care. A Beechen Bowl, the Honour of my Hall, Will serve to hold my Drink which shou'd not be too small; Nor yet so strong as shou'd the Senses steep In an unwholesome and a Death-like Sleep, When waking, the loose Epicure (in pains) Finds Tumults in his Head, and Fire shoot thro' his Veins. There wou'd I Sport with what the Season yields; The Woods, the Mountains, Rivers, Dales and Fields, Cool Shades, and sunny Banks, and Murm'ring Streams, These with my Maker's Praise, shou'd be my daily Themes. There Men in their own native Shapes are dress'd, Nor make, like Apes Humanity a Jest, As Courtiers do (which Gen'ral Scorn incurrs,) To day in Silks, to morrow wrapt in Furs. To France for Fashions, and to France for Air They go as if they both were Mortal here: And thence return'd the Bully struts and huffs, Up to the Shoulders sheath'd, Arms, Gloves and Cuffs, In Hair Portmanteau Trunks instead of Muffs. Cool Searge for Summer is the Shepherd's wear, And Frieze, a Fence against the Winter's Air. Their Hearts ne'er harbour an intended Ill; So much their Vertue's stronger than their Will. Stretch'd at their Ease on the green Turf they lie, And see, secure, the bolted Vengeance fly That stops th'Ambitious in their full Carreer, And fills the anxious Hearts of Kings with Care; While sated with the Glories of a Crown, They're pain'd with Ease, and rack'd on Beds of Down. An humble Carriage and an honest Soul A friendly Gammon and a cheerful Bowl Y'are sure to meet; their very Hearts they wear Upon their Faces, as it's Seat were there. If angry, (as there's none from Passion free) They'll not dissemble that you may not see, But soon will let you know it sooner will agree. Thrice happy! who the Country's Peace does know! O Innocence! O Sight of Heav'n below! O Blissful State! And O ye immortal Pow'rs! Here let me pass my few remaining Hours, Redeem the Time I've lost, e'er the wide Grave devours. Not without Tears thus wou'd I oft complain, Thus wou'd I pray—nor did I pray in vain. Kind Heav'n at last my Patron's Mind inspir'd To raise me undeserv'd, and undesir'd: Nor shall the Grateful Muse forget his Name, Till Vertue cease to be the Theme of Fame. You know his Worth, too copious to be penn'd, The best of Masters, and the fastest Friend! But Little he of Fame and Honour hears, If Abingdon has yet not reach'd his Ears; A Name that thro' the Land does loud rebound, And shouting Crowds Attendant on the Sound. His Bounty here has fixt my wand'ring thought, And without asking gave the thing I sought; Far from the City, far from Noise and Strife, An Easy, Frugal, Temperate, Studious Life. Now, Sir, You may conclude I thought to find A Peaceful State adapted to my Mind: The Country like Arcadia I believ'd! Ah thus too long I thought! and was too soon deceiv'd! In vain we toil and labour to be blest, And with a Swarm of Thoughts our Minds molest, We grasp but Air when e'er we reach at Rest: The Slipp'ry Wanton sometimes comes in sight, But in a Moment mounts and takes her Endless Flight: And in ascending cries there is no Peace In City, Country, Waining or Encrease, Till weary Life does end, and all our Labours cease. By sad Experience now I find the Swain Is worse than Jew, and more a Slave to Gain: His Dullness all but Politick Disguise, To trick the Coxcombs that believe they're wise: Tho' not so smooth and Florid as the Cit He's ev'ry Inch of him a Rogue as Great. Our Sodom may have Ten the Town to save; But here 'tis nothing else but Fool and Knave. Go where you please, with whom you please converse, 'Tis worse than Wit or Malice can reherse. The Town, 'tis true, has most Examples shown Of Vice, because the Seeds are thicker sown; But let Regard to Quantity be had, Drop Man for Man and they are here as bad. Half void of Reason, and quite void of Shame; Before they know the Person, or the Name, They shall expose and Gibbet up his Fame. Since a Good Name's so precious, of all Wrongs The worst is suffe'ring from Malicious Tongues; A Proof all Mischief ends not with our Breath, For an Ill Tongue can wound us after Death. Now what Relief? Yes, I Relief may get, If I cou'd trace th'Examples YOU have set. Cou'd I like YOU, be Master of my Will, And wholly stifle ev'ry Thought of Ill; Be ever studious of the Publick Good, As ev'ry worthy Free-born Britton shou'd; Stand fast when Lawless Pow'r and Lust prevail, And, but for such as YOU, wou'd turn the Scale: Cou'd I, were I as able in my Store, With the same Libe'ral Hand relieve the Poor; Suppress all vain Inordinate Desires, And clip the Wings of Love's Fantastick Fires; To Vice be in its softest Form Severe, And make the vertu'ous Man as much my Care; Thus cou'd I let my Hours but glide away, I need not value what the Envious say; Dauntless I'd stand their Rage and take the Field; Such Worth were an Impenetrable Shield. In Town or Country thus y'are still the same; Nor Envy grins, nor Prejudice does blame, While unmolested you drive on to Fame. But Ah! while thus you Teach and thus you Live, And Practise ev'ry Precept that you give, I groan beneath my Vices and my Will, And, blaming others, yet continue Ill. You swiftly follow in the shining Chase Of Truth, first at the Goal in ev'ry Race; Lagging behind my Weakness I deplore, And wonder how you keep so far before. To Mr. Lowin, from the Country. Horace does tell us, in this Human State There's not a Man contented with his Fate: Like Crassus Rich, he something else requires, Like Cæsar Glorious, yet he still aspires, And there's no fixing of his wild Desires. But as to General Rules there still will be Exceptions, so in this Great Truth we see The bold Assertion does not reach to Thee: Thy Station to thy Temper is so true, You neither seek, or Hope, or Wish a New. Attendance Cowley thinks a barbarous Fate, And vilest we can wish the Man we hate: Had he (O Friend!) been Intimate with Thee, Tho' more than Life he valu'd Libertie, He wou'd have own'd himself not half so Free. He inly griev'd to see the loose and vain The only Favorites of Fortune's Train. 'Tis said by some 'twas but his Muse repin'd, But what's the Muse in Poets but the Mind? 'Tis true, he begs not an abundant Store, But yet he cou'd not relish being Poor. When a loose prosp'rous Knave or Fool I see Grown proud by Wealth, I bless my Povertie; For Riches might have made me worse than He. Doubtless the Man does ill his Peace regard That thinks his Merit meets not due Reward: The World to him does but a Wild appear, And he thinks only Brutes Inhabit there; And all because a Coxcomb better lives, Or with a vast Estate too Little gives. Poorness of Spirit! 'tis the Noblest Mind That will be least beholden to his Kind; Or if he must, to Gratitude be true, And own the Gift, not claim it as his Due. 'Tis true the Wealthy shou'd supply the Poor, And only for that Reason they have more; But what Man can command another's Store? The Wretch then that does boast of Libertie And yet Repines is more confin'd than Thee For the Contented Man is only free. What can the Freedom of this Life afford Not thine in thy Dependance on thy Lord? Whether 'tis Plenty, Converse, Wine and Ease, And, which I name not, softer Joys than these. Or if it must the Term of Slav'ery have, What wou'd the Man that's free give to be such a Slave? When DORSET's nam'd we all wou'd Servants be, Few Masters then but wou'd Exchange with Thee. DORSET! whom Envy does not dare to blame, His Love Preferment; and his Praise is Fame. O happy Station! at a Meal more Wit You hear than is in Modern Laureats writ: Lightsome as Mirth! and soft as young Desire! It charms like Beauty! and it warms like Fire! So bright!—in vain I wou'd describe the rest, For 'twere not Wit if 'tis by me exprest. DORSET! whose Name's as deep in Fame enroll'd As Great Mæcenas by the Bards of Old, But HIM we only as a Patron view; THIS does reward us and instruct us too: But for those Poets THAT had ne'er been known, HE in their Works Immortal, THIS, Immortal in his OWN. And as his Verse does all the Bards out do, So does his Charity the Gownmen's too: They give in Dribs; he, op'ning wide his Store, With a full Hand astonishes the Poor. Then, when w'are blest with his Society, With how much Ease he lays his Greatness by! The Peer is lost; he changes Face and Mien, And only Friendship fills the Nobler Scene! Happy art Thou that, to this Worthy near, His Action's see'st and his Discourse dost hear; From thence You must above the Level rise, And by Necessity be Brave and Wise. I, curst by Fate, to disappointments doom'd, Proposte'rously have all my Life consum'd: I've nothing got, and worse, I nothing know! And all the Helps I have Receiv'd I owe. My Friends have for me many Favours done, I ne'er was able to return 'em One, Unless 'twere in this vain Poetick Way; 'Twas less to lose the Debt than take the Pay. Then Truth and Wit and Friendship here are scarce, The Natives of a Make, and Mold so base, They're one Remove worse than the Brutal Race. Yet I repine not, but the Storm abide; With Patience stem the rough unpitying Tyde, And Live—where Nothing else cou'd live beside! Yet tho' I grieve not, yet, believe me Friend, I shou'd be very glad my Case wou'd mend: I'm not so Wedded here, but I cou'd part From Knaves and Fools without a breaking Heart: Or if among 'em 'tis my Fate to stay, My Life shall yet wear easily away; At least I'll daily beg of Heav'n it may. Happy the Man that, free from Want and Strife, Does smoothly glide along the Stream of Life; Whose Conscience, free, no Op'iate e'er requires, And by his Fortune bounds his Wise Desires: If in the Court thou canst this Garment wear, Thou wilt not be the meanest Figure there. Next happy He! that with a Soul resign'd Can bear the Crosses laid on Humankind; Who, tho' unfortunate, can honest be, And Happier Men without Repining See; If ought on Earth be happier than Contented Povertie. O Friend! if in my Cell I this can do, Tho' I may Lodge much worse, I'll Sleep as well as You. Unto the Servant that is Wise shall he that is Free do Service. Eccles. 10th. 25th. The DREAM. To Sir Charles Duncomb from the Country. On my hard Fate, as late I pondering lay, Spent and bow'd down beneath the Toils of Day, By weary Nature to Repose constrain'd, I slept at last—and thus in Sleep complain'd. Ah Wretch! to this unhappy Clime confin'd; Lost to my Friends, and cut from Human kind: A Clime where only Misery does repair, And Life has no Cessation from its Care. The rigid Winters here come early on, With August brought, and scarce with April gone. In other Places Nature looks but bare, Some Marks of Spring continue all the Year; But ev'ry Winter strips her naked here. The miry Glebe imprisons Man and Beast, And there must come a Drowth to be releas'd. No Converse here the tedious Hour's beguile, But Love and Friendship fly the Barbarous Soil. Ev'n Honesty its self is banish'd hence, And Ignorance sets up for Innocence. The Natives are so truly homely bred, They're of a Piece with that on which they tread: Strangers to Vertue and all Lib'ral Arts; Their Oxen and their Swine have all their Hearts, Creatures of equal Intellectual Parts. Among each other endless Feuds they sow, And Malice lays Manure to make 'em grow. No Mutual Trust between 'em e'er presides; And Knavery follows when 'tis Inte'rest guides. Ava'rice is what they one and all pursue, Nor is a GOD believ'd while Gain's in View: For that they earliest rise, and latest toil, Their Souls, as 'twere, transfus'd into their Soil. Then when with Mirth they wou'd their Nerves unbend, What Patience can the Barb'rous Din attend! What Beast but better wou'd himself Acquit? Their Truth, Abuse; and Bawdry all their Wit. How vain are all the Tales the Ancients told, Of a Self-teeming Glebe, and of an Age of Gold? Of flow'ry Shades where Peace supinely reigns? Of fau'tless Nymphs, and of the faithful Swains, That liv'd so happy on th'Arcadian Plains? 'Tis all Idea—but by Fancy wrought, The Idle Rovings of a wand'ring Thought. Shepherds in ev'ry Age, and ev'ry Place; Were ever just as now, a Clumsey, Brutal Race. Ev'n Cowley, who a Rural Life had long Ador'd, and made it Deathless in his Song; When to the Fields he for the Blessing came, Found all their boasted Innocence a Name: And Chertsea stands (to contradict his Rhimes) Blam'd in his Prose to all succeeding Times. What Path can here derided Vertue take? What Musick can the sighing Muses make? Without Converse they lose their Force and Fire, And Reason back does to its Spring retire. The long Remove from Prudence, Wit and Arts, Sets us beneath our very Natu'ral Parts. If w'are not rising we go down the Hill, For Knowledge knows no Mean of standing still. The brightn'd Armour glitters to the Sun, But only using keeps the Polish on. Thus doom'd to Dulness, here I bury'd lie; O low, obscure, inglorious Destiny! Thus twice five Years I scarce can say I've liv'd; Or yet improv'd what's ne'er to be Retriev'd! My Youth has vainly, idly took its Flight, Unknown to Profit, Learning, and Delight: Depriv'd of London, then too little priz'd, Before I knew the Blessing I despis'd. For Towns, like Tallies, Man for Man does fit, And Wit does keenliest whet it self on Wit. Ah Noble City!—but too late I mourn My Fortune—banish'd never to return! Never (which yet I deeplier must deplore) Never to see the Gene'rous DUNCOMB more! DUNCOMB! whose Bounty thro' the Nation flows, Like Nile, diffusing Plenty as it goes. DUNCOMB! the Joy of ev'ry Orphan's Tongue! A Theme for ev'ry Future Laureat's Song! Once were these Shades with his dear Presence blest, When Me, ev'n Me, he singl'd from the rest; And kindly smiling on my Rural Lays, Crown'd 'em at once both with Reward and Praise. But Ah the happy Hours too swiftly run! Just like a blissful Vision seen and gone! But (O ye Pow'rs!) where e'er he goes be kind, And match his Blessings to his Gen'rous Mind. While Envious Fortune here my Hand employs In barren Labour, and Eternal Noise; Let all his Mornings rise, and Ev'nings set in Joys. Nor let him think I by my VVish intend A Covetous, or an Ambitious End: Only a Human Fate my Hope invites, And Innocence, in which my Soul delights. None better cou'd than I contented live VVith little, or from little more wou'd give: But 'tis no Life here in a Brutal Den, Banish'd from Books, from Manners, and from Men. 'Twas here, methought, a Glorious Form appear'd, Yet awful as a Goddess long rever'd: Her Monumental Tow'r the Skies out-brav'd, And on her Front was fair AUGUSTA grav'd. And why (said she) dost thou thus sighing ly? Why all Despondence and Relief so nigh? He that does set so many CAPTIVES free, He will, he must, he shall Remember Thee. Musing, I rose; and bowing thus reply'd. Ah Madam! not alone on Captives try'd, His Pow'er extends where ever Winds can steer, Nor will he once thy Heav'nly Beauty spare. He shall?—alas! You might have spar'd your Breath, I know the Wretched all are eas'd in Death. Now by my Pow'r (said the Illustrious Dame) (And may my Pow'r for ever be the same) Y'ave liv'd so long shut up in Rural Night, Your other Senses leave you with your Sight. Know'st thou not Me?—what Country is there found, What Region where my Name is not renown'd? Let Vulgar Names and Things submit to Fate, I can already boast a more than Mortal Date: This Privilege the British Glory gives, I'm only then to die when Nothing lives, Quite from the Rising to the Setting Sun, As vast a Round as his, my Fame has run. Let it be either Traffick, Peace, or War, What City sends her Naval Tow'rs so far? Who o'er the Ocean so triumphant rides? What Shores are water'd with such Wealthy Tydes? Beneath my Feet my Thames for ever flows, And for my Profit never takes repose; But shifting Tydes to Sea, and thence to Land, Does our own Stores and all the World's command: While on her Billows to my Hand she brings The noblest, richest, and remotest Things. Tho' round my Walls you scarce perceive a Vine, Yet half the Vintage of the Year is mine, And ev'ry Lombard Shop an Indian Mine. What other Town does there so nobly stand For Soil, for Health, for Pleasure and Command? What City does beside so Lordly rise, And sit so near a Neighbour to the Skies? My Turrets to the Clouds the Prospect fill, Like lofty Pines on some aspiring Hill. Who less fears War? and when a War does cease, Who Richlier does adorn the Arts of Peace? What Shoals of People pour thro' ev'ry Street! In passing on, what Myriads must you meet! How gay! how richly clad where e'er you come! What gallant Youths and Beauties in their Bloom! Not brighter Shines by Night the Milky Way, Than in my Streets the Charming Sex by Day. Who sooner can than I such Summs produce For self Magnificence, or Publick Use? Who can her Hand for Wealth extend so far? Or with such ready Loans defray a War? Loans that to Lewis gave such loud Alarms, He lik'd the sound worse than the Clank of Arms. He saw, in War, the Nerves of War increase, He saw, advis'd, and sought, and su'd for Peace. Beside (which further does my State commend) This Wealth no Mercenary Troops defend: No Works, or Rampiers rise in my Defence, By LIBERTY secur'd from insolence: My Safety strongly on that Rock I lay, And only Annual Choice confers, the Annual Sway. No least despotick Thought among us rules, The wish of Villains and the Yoke of Fools. Thus by a Fate peculiar but to Me, I make my Sons not only Rich, but FREE. Thou know'st me now:—Now know I hither came, Tho' late thou lov'st me, to encrease thy Flame, And joyn with thee in blessing DUNCOMB's Name: DUNCOMB! whose Praise I heard you now recite, And scarce the loftest Notes can do him Right. Nor shall his Worth be but proclaim'd by you, At once the Muses and My Darling too. 'Tis He, I mean, that does our CAPTIVES free From more than an Egyptian Slaverie: 'Tis he that everlasting Honour gains By nobly striking off my Debtors Chains; And in that Gene'rous Action has done more Than all I e'er advanc'd to Wealth before. Husbands he to their VVives again does give, He heard their dying Cries, and bid 'em live. So mighty Paul and Silas when they were Imprison'd, pray'd, and found the Angel there; Their Shackles broke, the Doors all open flew— But DUNCOMB's Angel stops not at so few, At ev'ry Prison, ev'ry Jayl does call, And like an Act of Grace, he manumits 'em all. She paus'd—and here had not the Goddess clos'd Her Speech, I certainly had interpos'd: That Noble Name of Honour and Desert Enlarg'd my Faculties, and fir'd my Heart: Scarce cou'd I to the Fair my Distance keep, And Joy almost had burst the Bands of Sleep. Ah! glorious Dame, I cried, (with a Surprize That flush't my Cheeks, and light'nd in my Eyes) That Name you Praise for ever tune your Tongue, First of your Sons in Panegyrick Song. But whence? or how is He become your Theme? That Name so lately injur'd in Extreme. An Envious Race, I know, his Ruin sought, Say Goddess, how the Mighty Change was wrought: Th'Effect must spring from some Stupendous Cause, Where Fair AUGUSTA gives such vast Applause. I spoke: When smiling with Superior Grace, (Both Majesty and Mildness in her Face) She thus Return'd—As a tempestuous Night Sets greater Lustre on returning Light, So Malice, raging without Rule or Form, Instead of sinking, rais'd him by the Storm. Easie and Rich, in Innocence secure, He wou'd not joyn with others to procure Success to Projects hatch'd against the State, By basely siding with th'Exchequer Cheat; But knowing well the Narrow Self Design The Profit shun'd, and did his Post resign. Unseasonable Vertue! out of Time Was DUNCOMB's Fau't, and that his only Crime: For this the bold Projectors cou'd not bear; He must be guilty that their selves might share, With double Joy, the Veng'eance and the Prize; And scarce Two Thirds their Avarice cou'd suffice. Whole Patrimonies thus the Courtier sweeps; The Orphan starves, the wretched Widow weeps, The Nation Groans, and yet the Senate sleeps. Here Human Malice might it self display, And many dark Designs expose to Day: Here to the Life the close Rapacious Crew, In Sanguin Colours, might be set to view: But I forbear; nor shall their Rage inspire A Heav'nly Breast with like pernicious Fire. Let this suffice; expect the Joyful Day When all the Birds of Night and those of Prey Shall to the Deserts fly, to make the Vertu'ous Way It is enough I dissappoint their Aim, Secure the Guiltless in their Wealth and Fame, And fix in Honour DUNCOMB's injur'd Name. Good-Nature, Honour, Honesty and Sense All took th'Alarm, and arm'd in his Defence: Such is the Temper of an English Soul, It yeilds to Softness, but abhors controul. Tir'd with their Spite, and all their Hope's o'erpast To ruin Him, they left the Chase at last; But sullenly; just as the Wolf withdraws, The Lamb redeem'd from his extended Paws. By the known Laws he did himself acquit, Rescu'd by Heav'n from Malice, Power and Wit, From Bribes, and from the wide devouring Jaw Of high Oppression, to take Place as Law. 'Twas here, (and I the Influ'ence did impart,) Touch'd with his Wrongs, and knowing his Desert, My Sons advanc'd him to the Shrieval Name; Where now he honours That and gives the Nation Fame. My Royal Master by this Time was come. As late with Laurel crown'd with Olive home: That God-like Prince that did so boldly dare All the Extremities of Mortal War; Nor wou'd the shining Chace of Glory cease, Till he had crown'd his Martial Toils with PEACE. In ev'ry Field he foremost wou'd appear, Or succo'uring of that Part, or routing here, As Mars himself had been in Action there. Nor did his Heat drive cooler Thoughts away; His Arm, descending, in the Mid'st wou'd stay, And Quarter give tho' doubtful of the Day. But as to such his Mercy did extend, So he no Danger wav'd to save a Friend. Thro' Horror Blood and Slaughter he wou'd drive, Set raging out, and like a Storm arrive: These dying fall and others Prostrate yield, And wide Destruction covers all the Field. His Courage thus!—nor was his Conduct less, Both try'd—and never try'd without Success. But now there does a Milder Scene appear, To shew him great in Peace, as great in War. I best can see (a thousand Ways display'd) How he at once advances Truth and Trade. The Country too does in the Blessing share; And it does reach to Thee—to Thee ev'n here, So far remov'd, and out of Nature's Care. Plenty and Safety with their Brooding Wings Extended wide, produce all useful Things; In Peace the Plowman reaps, of Peace the Poet sings; Never of all our Martial Kings, from Heav'n To Britain has there yet a Prince been giv'n That sooner did in Camps arrive at Fame, Or past more Dangers to a Deathless Name. In Him the Two most distant Glories meet, All that on Earth is Good, with all that's Great. Here did my DUNCOMB's Honours shine anew, For me not only, but the World to view. This Prince that from his Soul does Worth regard, And never gives th'Immoral Man Reward; That never once on Cowardice did smile, But those he Raises Guardians of the Isle; Ev'n He himself, the Envious to convince Of their own Spite, and DUNCOMB's Innocence, Gave him the Recompence with which we see He Crowns persisting Faith, and Suffe'ring Loyaltie. Whom the King Honours and the People chuse, To such a One who can Applause refuse? Fit for the Praises of the Chasest Muse. Let then his Loud-Tongu'd Suffe'rings be repaid With louder Praise;—for, since my Walls were laid, No Subject e'er was such a Friend to Trade. Who does the Nation's Inte'rest study more? Or better Laws propose to feed the Poor? Nor does he (splitting on the Common Shelf) Propose to others what he shuns himself: To give by Dribblets (which is chiefly done) Is but to keep the Needy starving on: He lays out his Reliefs at nobler Rates, His Dole's a Market, and his Gifts Estates. Who in his Office ever raised so high AUGUSTA's Name for Hospitality? What Table thro' the Nation does afford So vast a Plenty as his Shrieval Board? Who for the Loyal noblier does prepare? And Wit and Vertue still are welcome there. Mean while the sparkling Wines around him move, Th'Inspiring Nectar that the Muses love. Stay then no longer thus lamenting here, But hope a milder Heav'n and kinder Air; The Rising of thy Better Stars is near. If my Perswasions have not lost their Charms, My DUNCOMB shall restore Thee to my Arms. Wealth, Wit, Employment, all by HIM are sway'd; 'Tis but a Word, a Nod, and He's obey'd. I here had answer'd but the Dame withdrew; And with Her Sleep retir'd, and left me too: But left th'Impression deep upon my Mind Of DUNCOMB honour'd, and AUGUSTA kind. Ah Heav'n! I cry'd, let him but Prospe'rous be, And 'tis no matter what becomes of me. Forgive me, Sir, that thus (opprest with Spleen) I treat you with this Visionary Scene; That on a Night-piece I your Worth display, So dear to Vertue, and so worthy Day. Nor let the Muses lose me your Esteem, Since they Petition only but in Dream: In Dreams they live, and chiefly Dreams regard, But most they Err when Dreaming of Reward. But tho' my Sleep dissent, I waking ne'er Upon that Subject shall offend your Ear. These Melancholy Vapours, bred at Sight Of Winter, with the Spring will take their Flight; When Op'ning Sweets, and Universal Green, Produce a Gay Inimitable Scene. Tho' now with Rains, or Shudd'ring Frost, we strive, That Glo'rious Season will again revive: The Tuneful Choir, thro' ev'ry Field and Grove, Will then renew their Musick and their Love: With them th'exulting Muse her Voice shall raise, And waking then I'll sing my PATRON's Praise. HYMENEALS: OR, Marriage Verses. To my Lord Eland, on his Marriage and Return, &amp;c. Pardon, my Lord, if a poor Poet, one That is not, and deserves not to be known, Presume not only (hardn'd in his Crime) To greet your safe Return with Doggrel Rhime, But wish your Future Years may This atone, And bless no other Country but your Own; Which, as it griev'd to want your Presence here, Envy'd it's Shining in another Sphere. Many there are that travel Foreign Parts, They say, to know the Manners, Men and Arts; Yet (tho' they boast of leaving it behind) Bring back a Dross too course to be refin'd Affected Body, and Affected Mind: For such Accomplishments we need not roam, Fools may be made with least Expence at Home. But you, my Lord, have nobler Conduct shown, And brought from the French Court what will adorn our Own; A Vertuous Wife!—a thing so rare to see, Ev'n Holy-Writ mentions but two or three. To her own Native Soil she bids adieu For dear Religion, and her dearer You: Nor has she lost, but in your Arms will find Sublimer Blessings than she leaves behind. For early y'ave the Chace of Fame begun, Nor are, but by a Father's Name, out done: He, when three Parts of four in Darkness lay, Broke the thick Scales, and made us see the Day, And drove our Fears and Jealousies away. False Fears and Jealousies, those useful things To rere Usurpers, and to ruin Kings. His Noble Image we in YOU may find, Lively in Person, livelier in your Mind; For both have climb'd the Mountain's Top, there sit, He, Judge of Wisdom, You the Judge of Wit. To Sir Edward Nevil Baronet, On his Marriage. Now, Sir, when your Good Angel does rejoice, And look down pleas'd on your Auspicious Choice; When Love and Beauty, drest in all their Charms, Give up their dearest Fav'orite to your Arms, It may be thought Impertinent, in me, To grate your Ears with worthless Poesie: When Hymen's sacred Musick Charms the Sense, All other Sounds are harsh and give Offence: And yet, alas! tho' conscious of my Crime, I still, go on—a Slave condemn'd to Rhime. 'Tis grown almost a Miracle to see Two Natures form'd by Nature to agree: Wedlock is now all Interest and Design; Th'Affections part just where they us'd to joyn. Your better Fate this common Ill controuls, By making first an Union in your Souls. Your Lovely Bride, Chast, Courte'ous, Noble, Good, And you, Sir, Eminent in Worth as Blood; Just, Loyal, Brave—all that can claim esteem, And make the Poets up a Deathless Theme. Hereafter (when we better may presume) We'll jointly give your Vertues ampler room; Dilate whole Pages on your Wit and Truth, Her Matchless Graces and her Fau'tless Youth: But at this Time, while we the Muse employ, Our Duty but detains you from your Joy. Hail happy Pair! your Race of Love's begun, And may you still be eager to love on. May Pleasure flow, and (because all must tast What Sorrow is) may Sorrow ebb as fast; That ev'ry Day, progressively, may be A further Step into Prosperitie. May long Life bless you, and a Health as long, And may you, too, be Fruitful while y'are young; That from your Loins a Loyal Race may spring, T'adorn their Country and to serve their King. To an unknown Relation; Hearing he was happily Married. 'Tis, sure, the fairest Branch of Nature's Law To love all Men, ev'n those we never saw: By the same Rule, it follows, we shou'd still Rejoice at their good Fate, and mourn their Ill. Ev'n Gene'ral Charity thus much shou'd do; But I've a nearer Tye to grieve, or joy for YOU: Thy Sister, still Indulgent to my Ease, And Good, as she were only made to please, Suspends my Care, and Silences my Grief; Which, but for her, had never hop'd Relief. Ingrateful then, Ill-natur'd shou'd I be, Did I not wish a like content to Thee, Did I not wish the Consort you have chose May think her chiefest Pleasure, thy Repose. For Vertu'ous we will write her, tho' unknown; Ev'n in thy Choice her Wit and Worth are shown: What cou'd Inspire thee with a Lover's Care, Must needs be something very Chast and Fair. O may you long be happy in her Arms, You never want for Love, nor she for Charms; But smoothly glide along the Stream of Life, A Tender Husband, and Obedient Wife. And O may never Jealousy destroy Your Peace of Mind, and clog your rising Joy. May ev'n the World to thy own Wish agree, The World, which has too often frown'd on Me. Of Adorissa's Second Marriage with Mr. Grevil. A sable Mantle Heav'n sometimes does place Between our Eyes and the Sun's lovely Face; But long that Gloominess does never stay, Or if it shou'd, it cannot conquer Day. Thus Sorrow, lately, did attempt to shroud Fair Adorissa's Glories in a Cloud: Her Mind, 'tis true, the Tyrant did invade, But her all-bright'ning Eyes cou'd fear no Shade. Affliction, while 'twou'd Enviously disarm Her Looks of Darts, is made it self a Charm. Beauty, distrest, does open to our View A Lustre that before we never knew; First our Concern, does then our Wonder move, And the next Step's Inevitable Love! In vain Eclips'd, her Eyes (us'd to subdue) No sooner look abroad but wound anew. Around her soon her hopeless Lovers lay, At once an easie, and a num'rous Prey. Ah! why ye wretched Rivals? why d'ye run With such preposte'rous Hast to be undone? Alas! the happy Man can be but One. See all the while how easie she appears, How unconcern'd she their Addresses hears; Does not, severely, all Approach forbid, Yet guards her Fame no less than if she did. While other Ladies, with affected Arts, Like Fishers, angle for their Lover's Hearts, Rob their own selves both of Esteem and Ease, By an Inordinate Desire to please. She from the Top of Chastity looks down On all alike, without a Smile or Frown: Gives no one Hope, yet gives no one Despair, As if all Passion were beneath her Care. Mean while her Lovers thus expostulate (Unable to conceal their Pain) with Fate. Ah! why? why did you to her Eyes ensure Such Pow'r to charm, when she disdains to Cure? Once, Mighty Love, she to thy Yoke did bow, Where are thy Darts, or her Obedience now? By what strange Magick does she Passion move, Yet be her self Insensible of Love? Or because Heav'n snatch'd Damon from her Arms, Must we all fall a Victim to her Charms? Or was the Noble Youth depriv'd of Breath. For us to bear him Company in Death? Like as of old some dying General, He has his Thousands to attend his Fall. O cancel! cancel this severe Decree! Or have you learnt to be as deaf as she? This just Complaint at last did reach the Ears Of Mighty Love, and not in vain he hears: For now, amidst her Train a Youth she spy'd, Who without timely Pity must have died: More Prudent, Brave, and Lovely than the rest, And sweet as dying Swans his Grief exprest; Sigh'd out his Cares in such a melting Strain, That none but he believ'd he lov'd in vain. Mean while her Eyes, now sick'ning with Desire, (For Excellence will Excellence admire) Proclaim'd she cou'd not see the Youth expire: Tun'd both alike, her Heart with his did move; And that which was Compassion, now is Love. Blest be the Look in which she did impart The Pointed Charm that reach't his Noble Heart; A Heart that ev'n thus early has its fill Of all that Wit and Honour can instill. And blest be she, of Cruelty affraid, That does repair the Breach her Eyes had made. Who wou'd not Venture the last Gasp of Breath To be when just expiring, so redeem'd from Death! Whether she sing, Discourse, or Look, or Move, Or Smile, or Frown—her ev'ry Action's Love! She can be nothing that we don't admire! Yet ev'ry Minute lifts our Wonder highe'r; Smiles as it comes, and opens to our View Something that is Resistless, something New. And as the Sun, in its own Essence bright, Sends forth his Beams, the Progeny of Light, Yet never does decrease of Lustre find, Supply'd from the Eternal Sourse behind; So flow the Graces from her fairer Face, And, undiminish't, fresh ones fill the Place. If we are rapt but gazing on her Charms, What must he be that has her in his Arms. Long may he live, the Blessing all his own, And sickness, Care, and Jealousy unknown. May his Love last, her Beauties never Fade, But be at Sarah's Age new Conquests made; Yet not to kindle an unhallow'd Flame, But to attest her Charms are still the same. And as she brought her former Joy and Heir, Let not the Blessing long be wanting here; Inspire some Poet that his Birth be sung, And worthy of the Blood from whence he sprung. Hail! Hail ye Lovely, Loving, Noble Pair! And O! accept the Muses humble Prayer: Tho' Kneeling Kings may oft meet no Regard, The Poor and Pious certainly are heard. 'Tis done! for see, Tranquility appears, Nor is it come for Moments, but for Years! To Dr. Harding and his Lady; Some time after their Marriage. To any other Marry'd Pair but You, How vain, and how preposterous wou'd it shew, In Hymen's Praise my Time and theirs to wast, And talk of Love when the First Moon was past? But tho' so many Myriads wretched are, The General Rule will some Exceptions bear: Once in an Age we may in Wedlock see All that this Life can call Felicitie. So when a Pestilential blast does fill The Air, and blow an Epidemick Ill; Some few the happy healing Breezes share, As if the God of Physick cull'd the Air, And wheresoe'er they mov'd wou'd breathe it there. There's not a Joy the Marriage Life procures, But signs and seals it self for ever Yours. Where can we Expect with Happiness to meet, If not with Peace and Plenty, Truth and Wit? As in Election, so your Nuptials prove There is as well a Chosen Race in Love. How strangely true our Wishes oft will fly, Ev'n when they take their Aim above the Sky? I saw, my Friend, the Fair you now possess, Blooming in Sweets, and breathing Tenderness: A wond'rous Goodness in her Eyes were fixt, Yet with each Glance there seem'd some Terrour mixt: So Egypt's Cloudless Sun Approach Confounds, So Light'ning when 'tis brightest deepest Wounds. By her discerning Conduct we might find He much must Merit that cou'd make her Kind. Concern'd for whom, 'twas this Reflection brought All her Desponding Lovers to my Thought. You, taller than the rest, elate were shown, Like Him whose Stature rais'd him to a Throne. I saw—and wish't you might her Heart obtain, And there with uncontroll'd Dominion Reign; A Sceptre which 'tis nobler far to sway, Than Kingdoms that but Grudgingly obey. From the Fair Conqu'rour then I turn'd my view, Contemplating her Happiness in You Where can she find, cry'd I, a Worthier Youth, So rich in Merit, and so fixt to Truth? His Manly Aspect does command an Awe: Like Eastern Kings that make their Nod a Law: Yet with the strong so sweet a Mixture's joyn'd, Like Mars, tho' daring; he's like Venus, kind. Then in his Breast he all the Goodness shares That Credits his Own Sex, and Conquers theirs. What Numbers will be left to Death a Prize, If he shou'd fall a Victim to her Eyes? The Triumphs of his Art (our Future boast) Not suffer'd to exist, will all be lost. 'Twill be a double Murder of the Dame At once to rob Him both of Life and Fame. Encline her, Heav'n, to hear her Lover's moan, The Fair are fairer yet when Mercy's shown; Ah! let her give him Peace, or lose her Own. I spoke—When Lo! the Gracious Pow'rs approv'd; And the next Glance the Loving was belov'd. O Happy State! O Smooth Elezian Life! O ever-sacred Names of Man and Wife! When Mutually each others Care we prove, And Wedlock walks in the smooth Paths of Love: When nothing harsh, or hideous e'er appears, To wound our Eyes and persecute our Ears: When from our Looks a glowing Ardour darts, With speaking Smiles, that Mind to Mind imparts; The dear and silent Intercourse of Hearts! When tun'd alike one touch both Wills does move; O Transport scarce to be excell'd above. How will this Choice thy Joyful Sire approve! Ev'n He, no less Successful in his Love. It will not be a mean or trivial Prayer, That you may prove alike Auspicious Pair. There Hymen long has laid a peaceful Head, With the rich Banquets of Contentment fed, And with a Gen'rous Issue blest their Bed. Happy! that can so Good a Father boast! And late some Lofty Genius mourn him lost. How to my Converse will he Condescend? With what Affection own himself my Friend? How much he knows! how little he'll profess! His Favours endless, and his Skill no less. The Double Blessing be on him bestown To give us Health, and long enjoy his own. And Thou, O Thou (not less in thy Desert) The Heir both of his Prudence and his Art; The same Success as His attend thee still, And Æsculapius dictate to thy Quill, To save as fast as City-Emp'ricks kill. How canst thou fail to ease us of our Harms, Blest with such Sweets in thy desiring Arms, And influenc'd with the Magick of her Charms! Auspicious Health attends Her Side by Side, And thus, Methinks, Instructs Thee to Prescribe. When a Lethargick Patient dang'rous lies, Flash on him full the Brightness of her Eyes: The Genuine Light; the All-Reviving Ray, Will drive like Mists the dozing Steams away, Unchain the Optick Pow'rs, and bring 'em back to Day. Where a Malignance has been Pow'rful long, Apply the Artful Musick of her Tongue; Let her but speak, the Evil will retire, As SAUL's Distemper fled from DAVID's Lyre. If 'tis a stubborn, tough, Hydropick Ill, The Sweetness of her Temper next instill; Quick thro' the Veins it will Triumphant ride, Change the whole Mass and Sanguify the Tyde. But if you fear these Methods yet may fail, And wou'd have something certain to prevail, A never-failing Cordial—from her Breath Extract Immortal Balm—and laugh at Death! In vain these pleasing Notions I pursue; This rich Elixir's all reserv'd for You: To us it does no other Prospect give, But that w'are doom'd to Die, and you to Live. While the soft Fair can such Reliefs impart, You need not have the least recourse to Art: But lost in Joys, and brightn'd with her Charms, Continue always Youthful in her Arms. It shall be so—I here the Muse engage From both your Minds to raze the Thoughts of Age. Love, Pleasure, Mirth, and all that's Sweet and Gay, Shall crown the Night, and hurry on the Day. A Series of Propitious Years, in Bliss Shall come and go, all smooth and Calm like this; Yet leave you still behind in all your Prime, Fixt in your Bloom, and unimpair'd by Time. Lo! with the Thought ev'n I my Cares forego, When thou art blest I must be happy too. I to thy Soul by secret Bands am ty'd, Thy Smiles my Peace, and thy Esteem my Pride. Friendship till now (the Life they lead above) Has been believ'd a Nobler Flame than Love— 'Tis past—and justly you the Fair prefer; I Yield—but I can yield to none but HER: SHE is the only Instance that does prove Friendship is not so dear a Name as Love. On my Lord of Dorset's Marriage with the Lady Mary Compton. If there's a Lot exempt from Human Strife, It must be His that has a Vertu'ous Wife. But if with Vertue Wit and Beauty joyn, What State can we Imagine more Divine! To Heav'n for Parallels we durst not go, But we are Sure it is a Heav'n below. Truth, and all else that Mortals hold so dear, Wealth, Honour, Peace and Safety Center there. With such a Spouse Affection ne'er decays; Nor have her Nights more Rapture than her Days: Her Love does these, her Duty those employ, And she admits no Vacancy from Joy. As at the early Dawn the Guilty Spright Drives back, and plunges in retiring Night; So flies Contention from her fairer Eyes; The Fiend must vanish when those Lights arise: If Riches come, she lessens not her Flame; Or if Adversity, she's still the same: Her happy Husband down in Safety lies, Sleeps in Content, and to Content does rise. O DORSET, she is Yours! and only You Deserve a Joy so Great, a Faith so True. What others Ages seek you early find, In One th'abridg'd Endowments of the Kind. The Vertues we describe sh' has practis'd long, No Female e'er Perfection reach'd so young. Her Youth's adorn'd with Nature's freshest Charms, Her Youth she brings unblemish'd to your Arms. Uncharm'd with the Regards of Birth and State, She takes a surer Method to be Great: To Vertue kind, to Vice a mortal Foe; No Scorn of Pride did ever higher go, Or Condescention ever stoop so low. Meek as the Dove, whom Nature gave no Gall, And free from Guile as Eve before the Fall: Had she been there the Tempter cou'd not boast, Nor had our State of Innocence been lost. But equal Joy Fate does on both confer: She gains in YOU no less than You by HER; Her utmost Wish!—a Form that does impart All that can please her Eye, or charm her Heart! With like Content you on her Beauties look, With equal Pleasure, equal Wonder strook; And when Night's welcome Mantle veils her Charms, With equal Fervor melt within her Arms. O only, only for each other made! O Mutual Couple! Transport undecay'd! Your Vertue does not to her Worth submit, Nor is her Face more wond'rous than your Wit: So bright her Eyes! w'are lost in Rapture there, And while you speak with equal Rapture hear! To this a Judgment so Mature is joyn'd, Your Praise, or Blame, determines all Mankind. To judge of Poesie some make Pretence, Damn what does please, and Praise what gives Offence; But all your Approbation-Stamps, is Sense: Currant it goes, with an unquestion'd Pride, The Metal prov'd, the Image Dignify'd: No Author e'er was so presuming yet, As to appeal from your unerring Wit. But tho' that Blessing we so much admire, Your Charity does raise our Wonder higher. Since He that taught that Duty hither came, No Mortal Breast has known so bright a Flame. Never to One did yet a Portion fall That came so near the Great Original, The vast Compassion that Reliev'd us all. So close this Vertue to your Soul does cleave, Not starving Debtors with more Joy receive, Than you with an ungrudging Bounty give. Nor did you, giving, ever yet deride The poor Receiver, such a Dole's but Pride; We see but Little to the Alms you hide: With secret Aid whole Families you raise, And scarcely fly Detraction more than Praise. The Muses Sons with like Regard you Grace, A Craving, Insolent, and Teazing Race: Like common Beggars, they your Doors besiege, Ingrateful, most; so dang'rous to oblige: They hang on Bounty just like Ticks for Blood, And scandalize the Hand that throws 'em Food. This Pest of Men you shou'd to starve permit, For Impudence is ill excus'd by Wit. Unweary'd Goodness! Kindness unconfin'd! O Youth to Manhood wonderfully joyn'd! Who e'er than Buckhurst was so fam'd so young? Or who but Dorset ever liv'd so long Without one Slander from an Envious Tongue? Ev'n different Parties in your Praises meet, And so employ'd, their Mutual Feuds forget: Ah! wou'd they joyn, our Liberties were sav'd, But, blind with Spite, they see not those Enslav'd: Pride, Bigottry, and Pow'r unbounded Rules,— But such a Government is fit for Fools. Your Courage, Friendship, Truth, we need not name, Nor Loyalty, so amply known to Fame, So oft in Dangers try'd, and still the same. 'Tis not for nothing Providence does bless All that you undertake with such Success. Ev'n that rough Sea where most Adventu'rers fail, That Bay of Biscay, that tears ev'ry Sail, Has favour'd You with an Auspicious Gale: Safe in the Port you ride (the Peace design'd) And looking back, Your careless Followers find Driving on Rocks, and fighting with the Wind. There, unconcern'd You sit, and daily see The Wrecks of Marriage, from the Danger free: Clasp'd in the Magick Circle of her Arms, Melting in Joys, and guarded with her Charms, Y'ave nothing now to fear of Human Harms. Slow let the Time go on, ye Gracious Pow'rs, Their happy Moments lengthen into Hours, Their Hours to Days, their Days to Years convert; Such Lovers seldom meet, and shou'd not quickly part. Be such a Buckhurst the next Ages Bliss, As HE that was the Ornament of this. Like Comfort in him let his Parents have, As Dorset to his happy Parents gave: A Liberal Patron may he like Him be, And by his Worth assert his Family. Hark how the General Shout approves my Prayer! The Omen's good; the Gracious Pow'r does hear, And as the FATHER, such shall be his HEIR. On my Lord of Abingdon's Marriage with the Lady Wenman. 'Tis done! Triumphant Accents rend the Air, And Hymen never made a Happier Pair: Delight does ev'ry Heart and Tongue Employ, And the Consenting Nation gives 'em Joy! Thus Heav'n afflicted Vertue makes it's Care, And when our Suffer'ings seem beyond Repair, Raises Relief ev'n from our Own Despair. Born for each others Joy; no Way but this Cou'd reinstate 'em in their Former Bliss. His Love her Widow'd Hours has overpaid; Ev'n by her Loss she is but happier made. And He cou'd have for years in Sorrow led, And all the Tears for dear Mirana shed, No Recompence but Beauteous Wenman's Bed: Equal in Worth, and equal in her Charms, And he once more does clasp an Angel in his Arms! As when the Sole Arabian Phœnix dies, Another from the Spicy Urn does rise, And with it's wond'rous Perfume fill the Skies: So from their very Grief their Pleasure Springs; Tow'ring aloft, with Riches on her Wings, She higher Sores and more Divinely Sings. Thus at the last Discriminating Day (The Dross of Human Nature purg'd away) The op'ning Graves our Bodies shall restore, Their Beauty, Glory, and Perfection more Than all their Prime of Youth cou'd boast before: But yet more happy is this Mutual Pair; Preceding what again will happen there, Their Joys have found a Resurrection here. When such bright Omens such a Work attend, As 'tis commenc'd in Joy, so late 'twill end. All just like this (so 'tis in Time decreed) Shall be the happy Moments that succeed: Soft as the Spheres on their smooth Axles move, The Hours shall run Perpetual Rounds of Love! Encreasing Mut'ual Comforts as they come, As Figures added still augment the Sum. Where Love alone cements the Marriage Tye The Knot may soon dissolve, and Passion dye; Who only Beauty weds, when Beauty goes No Conjugal Endearment longer shows: Hence Love at Twenty, is at Thirty Strife, And Hony-moons but bode a Wretched Life. But there where Beauty does with Honour meet, And Vertue joyns to make the Work compleat, There Peace does dwell, and ever new Delight, And Joys that terminate beyond our Sight: The rest is vain:—Only where Vertue's given, Entitles Marriage for the Work of Heav'n. Not as of Old; but, each by each betray'd, Wedlock a Snare is to the Wedded made, And grown a Cheat like ev'ry other Trade. This only Match redeems the Credit lost; One such Example is an Age's boast. But now, Methinks, the City Consort's drown'd, Tho' in less artful, yet a happier sound; For with his Oaten Reed th'exulting Swain (As if 'twou'd be the Golden Age again) Spreads Peace and Love and Gladness thro' the Plain. The happy news has reach'd their Rural Cells, And Fame aloud her Gratefull Message tells. Rejoyce, you Shepherds! and you Nymphs, rejoyce! Vertue is pleas'd, and Beauty has her Choice. Thoughtless of ill, and hating all Disguise, Your Hearts are ever open'd in your Eyes, Esteeming to be Honest more than Wise: Into your humble Dwellings Care can find No Entrance; Care, the Gangrene of the Mind. Safe in your Circles Trouble you defy, It glares aloof, or else stalks sullen by; Ill can't approach and Innocence so Nigh. Now speak your Joy! and welcome to your Groves The Chastest Flame that ever sprung from Loves. You with this happy Pair will most be blest, Friends from their Childhood to your Shades profest; O for their Plenty still return 'em Rest! In Cities (gilded with expensive Pride) Let Fool and Knave the Rural Life deride: Let Ladies, too, thro' their false Opticks see, And, name but Country, cry—Barbaritie! When yet in Courts they shall no higher Climb Than to turn lewd, and Rot before their Time. These, better knowing, build the Halcyon's Nest Where only, only Man from Strifes can rest. In Peaceful Shades and in the Silent Bow'rs, Ceres with Fruits, and Flora hid in Flow'rs, What thankless Wretch cou'd misemploy his Hours? There, Seeing how to Vertue still they tend, We look, admire; we Imitate, and Mend; And once Astræa does again descend! If such are pleas'd who but at Distance see, What must their near Relation's Transport be? Those who their Blood from the same Fountains drew, And clearly see what these but darkly view; Who in like Acts their happy Time employ, And whose Alliance gives 'em ampler Joy. By Contemplation of what Theirs may be, We yet climb higher 'toward Felicitie: A Nobler Object now our Duty claims, Norreys! tho' Young, an Elder Son of Fame's. Nor can he hide the Transport; 'twill arise, Dance on his Tongue, and Triumph in his Eyes. His Parents Happiness is his Content, And theirs Augmenting make his own Augment. Scarce e'er before Heav'n to a Father gave An Heir so Prudent, Dutyful and Brave. Most elder Sons a diffe'rent Gale does drive, Mourning but while their Parents are alive; Only to Women, Wit and Wine devout, Merc'ry within drives all their Rev'rence out: He, chaster, only fills his Consort's Arms, Nor has a wish on Earth beyond her Charms: Or if he had, cou'd hardly higher rear Imagin'd Graces than the Real there. Lovely as Innocence in Truth's attire! Her Vertue all that Precept can require, And fixt, like Heav'n's, not to be mounted higher; Her wond'rous Sweetness (to the meanest kind) Her Ample Fortune and her Wealthier Mind; Are Blessings that we strive withal to bear! Oppressing Pleasure!—but the coming Heir Will lighten half the happy Burden there. Nor less his Gene'rous Brothers bless the Day; Nor less the Muse cou'd of their Vertues say, Had she but Leisure on the Theme to stay. Great is the Hope their Country on 'em builds, Nor less the Promise of their Courage yields. O more than happy in a Parents Name! And in his Matchless Sons their Sire the same! Who can Six Brothers of that Substance find, Equally strong in Body and in Mind, And yet their Fathers Years no more declin'd? Arriv'd but little past the Middle Stage, Fix'd from of old to be the Bound of Age. Healthy and Vig'rous, Chearful, Strong and Gay, As if h' had Number'd no more Years than they. In Copying Him they'll be secure of Fame, And make their own, like his, a Deathless Name. Their Birth ensures their Vertue; to be Good, They need but trace the Dictates of their Blood. Magnetick, it does Nature's Pow'r controul, To ev'ry Vertuous Way encline the Soul, As Needles touch'd are sure to find the Pole. Brave and yet Pious, just their Father's make, From whose Example they th'Infusion take. From what vast Sourse can all this Goodness flow! The Sun, that does perpetual Light bestow, Remains the same, and does not brighter grow: But while the Bounty of his Worth is shown, He, still bestowing, still augments his own. Three Sisters next their Beauteous Faces show, And Love around 'em plants th'unerring Bow: The Shafts already he begins to whet, And wheresoe'er they look their Points are set. Who can from their Meridian Glory run, That at their Rising cast so warm a Sun! Their charming Mother shines in ev'ry Part, Flames in their Eyes, and fixes in the Heart: That wond'rous Pattern, shou'd they Practise right, Will make 'em Vertue's Boast, and Man's delight. 'Tis done! the Muse, that future Worth can tell, Sees how they all the Charming Race excell. Mean while their Father's happy Nuptial-Night They Celebrate with Triumph and Delight; Delight that only will be Greater known That Happier Night they Celebrate their own. I see, methinks, the Youths, whose Future Care Will be to pay their Adoration there; I see, at last, how they Successful prove, Truth crown'd with Truth, and Love return'd with Love! O Wenman! in this Noble Consort joyn, And with like Accents own the Match Divine. Your Gain's the same; and so the same shou'd be Your thanks to Heav'n for their Felicitie. The few whose Veins are fill'd with Noble Blood, Have double Obligation to be Good: They shou'd not less than their Fore-fathers shine, But still be lending Lustre to the Line; That Fame, Successively, may higher rise, By just Gradations, till she reach the Skies. Nor fail thy Blooming Sisters, tho' they're Young, To give us Hope they'll once inspire our Song: While a more moving Joy our Cares beguile, They know no other Pleasure but to smile: But what more happy Omen can commence With Wedlock than the Smiles of Innocence? O were they to the Muse but better known, Their Praises (which wou'd soon advance her own) She'd sing aloud to the Succeeding Age, Invite their Wonder, and their Hearts engage; And by the Bud of Beauty, blushing shown, Prepare our Youth against 'twas fully blown. What sacred Hand cou'd thus Divinely strike, At once to Tune these diff'rent Strings alike? Make various Int'rests with one Soul agree, And without Discord cause such Harmonie? A Harmony that lasting Joy imparts: O Wond'rous Musick of agreeing Hearts! No other Skill this Concord cou'd inspire, But what presides in the Celestial Quire: Nor less th'effect cou'd of the Union be Of all her Charms with all his Pietie. Cou'd we describe Him 'twere a Noble Toil, A Work on which succeeding Times might smile: 'Tis true, a Happier Pen has led the Way, Yet we'll endeavour at a faint Essay. His wond'rous Youth did early Promise give To what a Pitch his Worth wou'd once arrive: His Riper Vertues are a Proof how near Man may attain to a Perfection here. So Good, as if alone for good design'd! Nor is his Form less Charming than his Mind: A Manly Loveliness his Look does wear; The Sweet and Strong are justly mingl'd there. Nor others, nor himself he e'er deceives; And nothing's left unpractis'd he believes. More than his Foes he for their Error mourns, And Good for Evil constantly returns. What e'er his Anger, or what e'er his Wrong, He ne'er cou'd carry his Resentment long; But Pardon ask, it bears from thence it's Date; No Criminal cou'd ever come too late: Quite from his Memory you raze th'Offence, So like a God he smiles on Penitence. While we can think on Wrongs w'are yet not ev'n, And Copy ill the Precept taught by Heav'n; For he that's not forgot is not forgiv'n. Thus a strict Eye he o'er his Conscience keeps, And he will be at Peace before he sleeps. Nor has he but one Way arriv'd at Fame; In Publick and in Private he's the same. In Storms that did the Barque of State o'erwhelm, And threw th'unhappy Pilot from the Helm; When Pow'rful Faction did the Land divide; When boundless Lust and Arbitrary Pride O'erflow'd our Laws with an Impetuous Tyde; When plucking down the State but half wou'd do, And the next Step was to Unchurch us too, Then did our Hero in the Breach abide, Constant to Truth, and faithful to his Side, When Loyalty was never Nicelier try'd; When Conscience stood confounded at the Sight, And trim'd, it self, between the Wrong and Right. Devout as Hermits, and as oft at Prayer; The Church's Champion, and her Sons his Care. Bounteous as Heav'n, that to him largely gives, And largely 'tis diffus'd as he receives. His Favours, once conferring, know no end; The noblest Master, and the fastest Friend! His Word so Sacred, none cou'd e'er upbraid He ever broke the smallest Vow he made. Like Truth sincere, as sweet in his Address, And ever means the Thing he does profess. Unfit for Towns where Flatt'ry does preside, Where Worth to Vice, and Prudence bends to Pride; But O most fit! were Lewdness banish'd thence, And Courts encourag'd Honesty and Sense. O Live, Bertudor! Live in Blackmore's Lays! I, who want Wing so high a Pitch to raise, Stoop humbly for the Leavings of thy Praise: He is not wrong'd, or of Applause bereft, To let me take the Gleanings he has left: His Noble Harvest ne'er the less appears, Because I pick the loose and scatter'd Ears. What Consort for such Matcheless Worth was fit But She that does enjoy, and merit it? She that his Comforts cou'd retrieve alone, And, by Improving his, restore her own. A Virgin, Mother, Wife, and Widows Name So well discharg'd, is sure to meet with Fame. No Reputation e'er was earlier rais'd, More truly Honour'd, or more justly Prais'd. Her Worth (the Theme of all the Learned Swains) Sounds high as Heav'n in the Oxonian Plains. Her Name is known wherever Goodness dwells; Belov'd she lives, unenvy'd she excells. Thus to his Arms she comes, like Autumn, round With Plenty hung, and Num'rous Beauties crown'd: O charm on charm! Rich in her Earthly Store, But in her Graces and her Vertues more. Where can we such another Instance see; Of Mutual truth in Modern Qualitie? Design and Flatt'ry, Nonsense, Chance and Noise, Bring but the Marry'd to polluted Joys. Here Vertue only does the Spousals bind, And Angels are but in that Union joyn'd. Hail happy Pair! and from the Humble Muse Accept this Wreath, and her Delay excuse: Tho' no Addition to your Joy she brings, Do not despise her that in Duty sings: She has not yet with Flatt'ry so deceiv'd, As when she Praises not to be believ'd: From the strong Holds of Truth none shall Entice Her forth, tho' us'd the worse for scourging Vice: Clos'd in her Cell, and Quiet all her Aim, She neither covets, courts, or cares for Fame; But in Contented Poverty does sit, And laughs at those that think to thrive by Wit. To his Grace the Duke of Beaufort on his Marriage with the Lady Mary Sackville. My LORD, Let one unknown his willing Homage pay, To sing your CHOICE, and celebrate the Day That will to Thousands more Auspic'ous prove, With Beauty crown'd, and smiling all with Love! I see, Methinks, the Nuptial Pomp appear, But yet too distant to distinguish clear: All Glitt'ring as with Stars the Milky-Way; But those of Night, and these are Gemms of Day. Yet soon, alas! they vanish from our Sight, All Lost in Sackvill's Purer Globe of Light, Just as Aurora, when the Sun does rise, Melts into Paleness, and deserts the Skies. Here let our Praises fix; and on the Bride Propitious to her Fame, with Joy reside: The Bride! the softest of her Beaute'ous Kind! Her Form as much a Wonder as her Mind! Whom Providence to Noble Beaufort gave, To let him here of Bliss a foretast have! O Goodness that we never can express! For all Description makes Perfection less. Never did yet the Marriage Tye Commence With so much Sweetness, youth and Innocence. Not Eve, just finish'd by th'Almighty Pow'r, And led by Angels to the Nuptial Bow'r, Had Chaster Thoughts; or, blest with Greater Charms, Receiv'd a Nobler Consort to her Arms. Oh on her Face behold the Mother rise! Bloom in her Cheeks! and Brighten in her Eyes! I see her there with all Her Graces on, As then, when first She was to Dorset known; When Crowds of Lovers did their Cares express, But only, only His cou'd find Access. Hard is the Heart, and deaf must be the Ear, When so much Worth Approaches, not to hear. But Ah! a Mist of Fate extinguish'd quite That Beam of Heav'n, and snatch't Her from our Sight: A better Fortune may the Daughter boast, And doubly live the years that Angel lost. Ah! how did then Northampton's Countess stand, Raving with Grief, and deaf to Heav'n's Command! Patience! that makes all other Sorrow less, What cou'd it help in such a vast Distress! When to the Soul the Piercing Anguish drove, And there again had fresh Supplies from Love: What cou'd her Wisdom, what her Vertues do! How cou'd they close the Intellectual view, And heal a Grief which Thought wou'd still renew? For such a Blessing, and so early gone, Only this Happy Union cou'd atone. But hide, my Muse, that Prospect from our Sight, Nor follow Fancy when she leaves Delight. The Daughter lives, and Dorset lives to see That Loss repair'd in Her Felicitie! With Joyful Eyes He does the Rites Survey, And gives to Heav'n the Praise of the Auspicious Day. O Gene'rous Hand! that spreads like Nile his Store, And wou'd, if Possible, have none be Poor. Whole Families he does in secret raise; Performs the Duty, but prevents the Praise. Never before were Wealth and Honours giv'n To one so Grateful in Returns to Heav'n. For these and for a Thousand Deeds of Fame, Aloud the Poets Celebrate his Name: Nor less they owe to his deserv'd Applause, That tries their Ore, and Constitutes their Laws. Happy the Life and Labours of the Bard Since Dorset writ, and Dorset did Reward. By his Example He their Fury fires, And with his Hand gives all their Need requires. Ah long may Fate th'Æthereal Call delay! For how will they Subsist and he away? He is the Mirror, His the solid Name, And they but live in a Reflected Fame. And in that Mirror well the Muses see What their lov'd Theme, their Buckhurst once will be: Buckhurst! design'd for the next Ages Bliss, As Heaven did his Propitious Sire for this. Vast are the Hopes of his Meridian store, For never yet a Morning Promis'd more! All sweet his Temper! as 'twere fram'd to fit The Mothers Vertues, and the Father's Wit. With double Joy this Day to Him is shown, As 'tis a Call to Introduce his Own, When to his Arm some yielding Fair retires; And He Enjoys what all the World admires. One half we of the Noble Train have view'd; On Beaufort's Side 'twill be again renew'd: A Race fram'd for the Best and Noblest Things, Of serving Nations, and obliging Kings: Witness the Marquess who in Civil-War Advanc'd his Worth and Loyalty so far: To his Immortal Fame our Annals shew He Nobly Fought, and did what Man cou'd do (Tho' forc'd to Balance an Unequal Weight) To save the Church, and prop a Sinking State. Beaufort was next, who, to his Prince Sincere, When a Deserting Nation left him bare, Convey'd this best of Counsels to his Ear. O Stop your Course! nor Pow'r by Arms affect; Your People will Obey, if you'll Protect: But if on Gallia's Friendship You rely, And with your Consort,and Her Priests comply, You'll live Exil'd; and, last, unpitied die. In vain he spoke; the Wretched Prince aspir'd To all their Pride and Bigottry requir'd; When Beaufort to the Rural Shades retir'd: Where soon He found the Country's sweet Repose A Nobler Joy than Court, or King bestows. Free from Tumultuous Strifes and loose Excess, 'Tis only there we relish Happiness. There did he Plough, and Sow, and Plant and Build, And Triumph in the Labours of the Field; As if no End of Living he enjoy'd, But to do Good, and keep the Poor employ'd. Of these, some Ceres to the Garners bore; Some for the Cattle Reek their Winter's Store: Some turn the hardn'd Glebe, and lay it bare, To render't Pregnant for the following Year. There to the Clouds the Falcon wings her Way! Here runs the Tim'rous Hare, and there the Stag's at Bay: Nor yet does Reynard scape th'unequal Strife, But with his Death compensates for his Life. The Shepherd there his Flocks to washing brings, The Shearer here his Rich Employment sings; The Pride of Foreign Courts, and Wear of Kings! The Fatting Ox, the Loving Kine and Deer, For all their Wants have all Attendants near. Some in the Cooling Grots, and Fragrant Bow'rs, Like the First Pair, employ their happy Hours, To prune the Trees Luxurious Growth, and prop the bending Flow'rs. Some on the Verdant Lap of Flora lie, To root the Suckers that obtrude too nigh. Here Vistoe's, cut for many Miles out-right, Open the distant Country to our Sight, And fill the Eye with Wonder and Delight. O happy Stage of sweet and various Scenes! O Fountains, Wildernesses, Walks and Greens! So just your Order, and dispos'd so ev'n, To Eden scarce were greater Beauties giv'n, Tho' Cast, and Planted by the Hand of Heav'n! How cou'd such Numbers, by his Bounty sed, Eat on without a Miracle of Bread! But Prudence solely all his Actions sway'd, And Hundreds more had readily been paid: Nor ever was he better Temper'd found, Than when his Workmen spread the Country round, Walling his Trees, and managing his Ground. Thus did he Glorious live; and last expir'd, At once Belov'd, Lamented, and Admir'd. Hapless in only this;—first to survey His eldest Son relentless torn away, Then Die himself before this happy Day: That Son whose Vertues did the Age adorn, And whom it yet has not forgot to Mourn. I see, Methinks, th'Affrighted Steeds appear, Whirling along the Trembling Charioteer: With broken Reins the steepy Clift they take, And, Rattling down, a wild Confusion make: Entangl'd in their Harness, high they rear, Their threat'ning Hoofs, and shoot their Foam into the Air. The Marquess by this time Concern'd appear'd, But, leaping out, Receiv'd the Ill he fear'd: Pull'd by his Garments back, his Flesh and Bones Are Crush'd and Ground between the Wheels and Stones. His wretched Lady sees—She shrieks! she cries! She prays!—and cast to Heav'n her beaute'ous Eyes! In vain!—the Accents never reach'd the Skies! Some cruel Pow'r had, sure, the Passage barr'd, Or so much Worth and Sweetness had been heard!— But whither has my heedless Duty stray'd!— O drop the Pencil!—there's too much display'd! Be quick! and cast the rest into a Shade! And just in Time; for now in View I find His Noble Dutchess Dowager. Mother, whose aspiring Mind Does take the Skies, and soar above her Kind. O Pattern, ev'ry Lady long shou'd read! But nothing, nothing ever will exceed! If 'tis such Glory to be Vertuous Young, What must it be to live a Saint so long! In all our Annals where's a Female Name So truly Great, and well secur'd to Fame? Where can we find, if it as num'rous be As this, so well a govern'd Family? True as a Watch she does the whole dispose, And ev'ry little Wheel it's Office knows: No Jangle, or Confusion e'er is found; So smooth the Motion that does turn 'em round. What Servant ever was Incourag'd there, Intemp'rate, or neglecting Hours of Prayer? Most of our Noble Houses are become Odious abroad, and Schools for Vice at Home: But here a different Method still did shew We may be Nobly born, and Vertuous too; That Pow'r it self may yet Oppression shun, And Dignity and Honesty be ONE. Who ever saw the needy Tradesmen wait, Shaking their Heads, and crowding to the Gate, But coming still too Early, or too Late? Who ever saw the Poor and Needy Soul Derided? or Dismiss'd without a Dole? O Vertue that we ever must admire! In view of Heav'n, and yet advancing higher! Such Prudence has not till our Age been shown; Nor will again to Future Times be known, Unless the Beaute'ous Bride convey it down: Yes, Madam, all we in this PATTERN see, Her Management, her Wit, and Piety, The Coming Age expects will all revive in Thee. 'Tis fit, my Lord, we stop our Courser here; There is no Moving now the Bride's so near; No Creature can be blam'd for Gazing there! Abroad w'ave been, and took a spacious Ring, And now Return Your Mutual Flame to sing: O Sweetness!—but no more!—for Language fails Where such unusual Excellence prevails, And flashing round us more than Human Light, Confounds the Utt'rance equal with the Sight. I see You view her with a Lover's Eye, Darting their Beams, and melting into Joy. While others Beauties on the Stalk decay, You see Your BRIDE's advancing ev'ry Day; O may it Root, and never wear away! There may the Heav'nly Colours long be born; The very same that are by Angels worn, Or those in which Aurora dips the Morn. And may you yet this further Kindness prove, As She in Beauty, to advance in Love, Till we than HER can nothing fairer view, And Guardian Angels prove less kind than YOU. Where is the Mirth that to the Day belongs? Where are the Flutes, the Dances and the Songs? Summon ye Master Shepherds of the Plains, Summon together all the Nymphs and Swains, That ev'ry Soul, and loud that Heav'n may hear, May bless the Happy, Loving, Lovely Pair! 'Tis done!—the Hearty, General Shout I hear, It rends the Mountains, and it deafs the Air! See! how in Crowds Obsequiously they move To welcome Beauty, and to Honour Love. Among the rest, O deign but to Receive This Chaplet which the Rural Muse does weave; If but with Smiles her Present You Regard, She humbly here withdraws, and asks no more Reward. On the Marriage of Sir James Long Baronet, with the Honourable Madam Henrietta Greville. Tho' this address we have too long delay'd, 'Tis better late, than Negligently Paid: Th'Approaches to the Noble and the Fair Claim this Regard,—to be Perform'd with Care; And here in Chief: Of all the Myriads joyn'd, Where ever yet was Hymen half so kind? The further from the Nuptial Day they move, The more 'tis Peace and Truth, and Joy and Love! Of all the Worth which was before but guess'd, He finds his Beaute'ous Bride in full possess'd; Love in her Eyes, and Eden in her Breast! Others, 'tis true, that Marriage Songs indite, Take the young Pair just on the Nuptial Night, When Love Triumphs, and ev'ry Thought's Delight! No other Scenes are set before their view But smiling Hours, and Joys for ever new! All Human Blessings must their Hope attend, And Guardian Angels at a Call descend. Ev'n Age it self—but there alas! w'are wrong; They're to be ever Gay, and ever young! In short, just as the Present Hour they find, They're made to fansie all the rest behind, Auspicious, Charming, Easie, Soft and Kind! Thus, while the Nuptial State so high they dress, All Worldly Joys, by vast Degrees, are less, And Heav'n it self but Equal Happiness! Were we dispos'd such Raptures to allow, We never had a Juster Theme than now: The Youth so Faithful, and the Nymph so fair, Might fix our utmost Admiration there; There to the Clouds we might our Musick raise, And to their widest Stretch extend the Wings of Praise! A Thousand Tender Things we might rehearse, And half Transfuse their Souls into our Verse. Back to the secret Source we might retire, E'er yet their Hearts were Conscious of Desire, And there behold, in the Myste'rious Frame, Their Infant Passions Quick'ning into Flame; While all the Vertues and the Graces wait To aid the Birth, and make their Joys compleat. For now the youth his Utmost Pow'r applies! And now the Fair darts her Victorious Eyes! O Equal Conflict! O Auspicious Doom! Where both are Vanquish'd, both must overcome!— But from this Scene w'are call'd in hast away To view the Triumphs of the Nuptial Day. Compos'd the Bride, and Thoughtful does appear, Strugg'ling at once with Love and Hope and Fear But all in Rapture does her Lover stand, Nor can his Soul th'unruly Joy Command! With Anxious Looks he chides the long Delay, And bids Hyperion hurry on the Day. When will (He cries) the tedious Rites be past? What need of Vows to Souls already fast? When will the Night, the happy Night arrive? That I may say—'tis now, indeed, I live! When my Fair Bride, all Lavish of her Charms, Trembles with Joy, and dies into my Arms! All this and more we might in Num'rous Strains Tell to the Nymphs, and Echo thro' the Plains; But then we shou'd (just like the most that Write) Neglect Instruction to promote Delight. Ev'n I my self, that such a Conduct blame, Come yet so nigh to warm me at the Flame. From such a sweet and Mut'ual Couple joyn'd, The Contemplations will be soft and kind: A secret Pleasure from the Theme will rise, Heave in the Heart, and Lighten in the Eyes. But these, and all the soft and Am'rous Things That Mut'ual Love Inspires, and Hymen sings, We leave to him, and to his Dearer Part; Nor will the Joy but equal such Desart. Mean while the Muse a louder Note shall sound, Her Brows no more with Rural Myrtle bound: Ambitious, She her Usual Stile rejects, To sing the Vertues which She more affects; And from this Union what the World expects. First, Sir, from you it justly does require A Mind that does to Glorious Deeds aspire, To Grace your Line and raise its Grandeur higher: Not that it needs a fresh Recruit of Fame; But that you shou'd assert from whence you came, And joyn to it another Deathless Name. We know the Age (tho' speaking from the Sky An Angel taught) will take a different Ply: Most of our Youth, deriding all that's Good, Are grown the Scandal of Illustrious Blood: Melting in loose Delights, their Time they wast, For Epicurus first, and Hobs at last: Their Lives to trace exceeds a Satyr's Spite, So much they Sin above what Rage can Write. Ah! shun the Rock on which these Monsters split, Nor fly from Wisdom to be thought a Wit. Justice Impartially to all Dispence, Protect the Poor and humble Insolence: And that you may the readiest Path pursue That leads to Fame, and Work for Fame renew, Preserve your Grand-sire's Image fresh in view. A Thousand Ways we may his Worth express; And hitherto your Conduct claims no less. Who has deliver'd down to After Days A Nobler Name, and Happier Theme for Praise? His Converse Nothing Human cou'd Transcend; The Dearest Husband, and the Fastest Friend. With Tears I yet deplore th'Unhappy Day When from his Country he was torn away, And at a Time that most requir'd his Stay: Nor was he by the Muse condol'd alone, But waited to the Grave with Gene'ral Moan; Peace his Delight, and Justice all his own. Nor further need your Linage be express'd; He in his Noble and Capacious Breast Epitomiz'd the Worth of all the rest. But for your Consort, Vertu'ous as She's Fair, 'Tis only Laureat Angels that may dare To think, or Offer at Instruction there; Resolv'd to Future Ages to Transmit A Glorious Name, for Prudence, Truth and Wit. Her Beaute'ous Mother we exactly find Drawn in her Form, and Breath'd into her Mind. Long has that Family the Glory worn Of Nymphs for Love, and Sons to Honours born; Both in their Seve'ral Classes truely Great; The Conqu'ring Eyes of These disposing Fate, And Those for many Ages Props of State. Yet wou'd She please on Lady Long the Elder. Portia's Life to look, She ne'er wou'd read, perhaps, a Nobler Book: If by that Rule She does her Conduct Square, Sweet as She is, she'll meet Improvement there, And soon become the Pattern of the Fair. Portia! a Name that does at once Infuse Joy to the Heart, and Fervour to the Muse: Portia! a Name that, wheresoe'er it comes, Breaths Richer Fragrance than Arabian Fumes; Portia! a Name that with Astræa vies, That Pride of Earth, and Honour of the Skies. Before her Eyes all Conscious Guilt retires, And Spotted Envy with a Frown Expires; So Pois'nous Creatures in th'Hibernian Isle Die by a Blessing, and assert the Soil. But, foolish Muse, can you no better see Than, after such a View of Pietie, To think this Happy Pair have ought to learn of Thee? Her very Casual Converse more does Teach Than thy most Study'd Flights cou'd ever Reach: With begging Pardon then your Crime atone, And by her Nobler Thoughts Improve your own: Deriving Truth from so Sublime a Spring, You'll higher soar, and more Divinely sing. Mean while an Offe'ring to the Mutu'al Pair You yet may make,—but it must be by Pray'r! And fetch it from the Heart that Heav'n may hear. Yes, Sir, so far you may the Bard permit, To pay in Duty what he wants in Wit. May all your Days to come serenely flow, Like Rivers smooth above, and clear below. In all the Blessings you but think you need, May ev'ry Hope and ev'ry Wish succeed: On to old Age Obsequi'ous Health attend, With Peace of Mind,—the dearest Bosom-Friend; Riches cou'd never still a stormy Breast; It is that Opiate gives the Sweetest Rest. And You, O You! the Glory of your Kind! May you the same Auspicious Fortune find: May all the Happy Issue be you bear, Brave, like the Longs; and like the Grevills, Fair. And since the Charms of Beauty will not stay, But soon resign to Envious Time a Prey, Let 'em decline like a bright Ev'ning Sun, Clear to the last, and Glorious going down; Just as the Blushing Rose it's Fate does meet, Fair in Decay; and in their Ruins, Sweet. LUCINIALS: OR, Birth-Verses. To the much Honour'd James Hunte of Popham, Esq; on the Birth of his Son and Heir. As when some fam'd Procession we survey, Some Restauration, or C'ronation Day; Tho' ev'ry present Object gives Delight, 'Tis still succeeded by some Nobler Sight; Till the Crown'd Head does last, elate appear, And fixes all our Joy and Wonder there. Heav'n so to you its Blessings does dispence, The last that comes still first in Excellence; Till now you such a Pledge of Love receive, You scarce have more to ask, or Heav'n to give. Of Ancient Blood, to Great Possessions Heir; Yet Your Auspicious Fortune stops not there, But gives You, in your Person and your Mind, All that obliges Man, and softens Womankind. The fair Amynta next you did survey; Bright as the Beams that round her Temples play, Angels are scarce compos'd with less Allay: To paint whose Beauties Language is too weak, And all that Love believes, or Praise can speak: But you soon found (to all Men else unknown) The way to make that Excellence your own. Who wou'd not think your Joy compleated here? When Lo! another Blessing does appear; A Daughter born! the perfect Image giv'n Of fair Amynta, as she is of Heav'n. Never before did Time produce, so Young, So just a Subject for Poetick Song. Sweetness and Innocence we find exprest At full, and Angels are no better drest; They in that Habit wing the Courts above, Their sole Employment Harmony and Love. Again she teems! another Daughter yet! To make your Comforts certain, as they're Great; Whom with like Extasie we all behold, The Stamp the same, the same Æthereal Mould. And now, can any Blessing wanting be To fill your Measure of Felicity? There can: And see! Your Prayers Success have found, And ev'ry Wish and ev'ry Hope is crown'd: Nor can You further be oblig'd by Heav'n, But to preserve the Treasure he has giv'n. How bounteously the Powr's their Creatures bless Ev'n their Denials are our Happiness: Shou'd they give all that we profusely crave, They scarce cou'd grant so much as we wou'd have: The Bounds of Thanks we then shou'd over-leap, Nor value Happiness that came so cheap. Yet those Delays that Heav'n so often makes, Does seem to be entirely for our Sakes; To make us with the greater Quickness taste That Nectar, which wou'd Cloy devour'd in haste. Thus tho' some Years y'ave waited for the Boy, You now have all the Sweetness of the Joy. The Homely Swain and his more Homely Wife (To whom h' as sworn to be a Drudge for Life) To Venus go, just as at Rutt the Deer, And never fail to have their Faun a Year: But in the Bounty are so little Skill'd, They grieve and murmur that their Table's fill'd. 'Tis only he that does almost Despair To have one, knows the Blessing of an Heir. Auspicious BOY! that ere thou canst receive, Or Pleasure know, dost lasting Pleasure give. I see thy Father yet in his Surprize, The happy Tydings pregnant in his Eyes, When the half fluster'd Mid-wife to him run, And cry'd—God give you Joy, Sir!—'tis a Son! With him, methinks, I see thy Grand-sire too (Tho' distant, seen by an Internal view) I see him stand, his Eyes erect to Heav'n, From whom he does acknowledge thou wast giv'n, Returning Praises from a Grateful Heart, And in the Pleasure shares as large a Part: Live! live, he cries! grow both in Grace and Fame, And down Posterity convey our Name; That as our Noble Line does back extend Thro' Ages past, it forward too may bend, Nor be extinct till Time it Self shall end. Nor less than this can thy Great Grand-sire say, Who never thought to see this Happy Day. Almost a Centu'ry of Years h'as ran, Yet fresh as Thou that hast thy Race began. Nor is this all the Happiness he'll view, He shall behold his Grand-Son's Issue too, And bear 'em in his Arms his Eyes to please, As Joseph, Machir's Children on his Knees. But while they're thus rejoycing, can a less Transporting Bliss Amynta's Soul possess? This Blessing cancels all she fear'd before, The Mother's Pangs remember'd now no more. Close in her Arms she twines the Pleasing Care, And Joys to see her Husband's Image there; Wishes he Master of like Worth may be, In Truth and Friendship Eminent as he: Nor need she doubt but when to Manhood grown, He by like Deeds will make his Linage known; What less? when in his Composition's joyn'd His Mother's Graces, and his Father's Mind; Than which a nobler Mixture cannot be T'adorn and elevate Mortalitie. Hail, happy Sire! the Muse does give you Joy, And long may you be happy in the BOY: The soft Amynta long may you embrace, And she be still Augmenting of the Race: Amynta! equal'd by no other Dame; Poets give them, but she gives Poets Fame, Made Deathless but repeating of her Name: Her Beauty has Inevitable Charms, And where is Heav'n if 'tis not in her Arms! To Henry Bayntun Esq; on the Birth of his Son and Heir. An ECLOGUE. Strephon. Alexis. STREPHON. D'ye hear, Alexis, the Triumphant Sound? The Bells with Shouts, and Shouts with Trumpets drown'd? The Vocal Joy with Instrumental vies, And see! the Fires already climb the Skies! Ah! wherefore does thy Lyre thus lie unstrung, When Adorissa's Call commands thy Song? Heav'n has at last oblig'd the Kneeling Fair; She has her Wish, and Damon has an Heir! ALEXIS. I know it, Friend, I know this General Joy Is for the Birth and Blessing of the BOY: But O! when Multitudes rejoyce aloud, What single Sound's distinguish'd in the Crowd? 'Twas therefore (and I hope not uninspir'd) To speak that Joy I to this Shade retir'd. Yes, Strephon, yes, I find my glowing Breast With something, sure, Prophetical possest; It heaves for vent! and, O believe me, Youth, It warms like Vertue, and it charms like Truth! STREPHON. Speak then, O speak! and feast my ravish'd Sense; What Theme so just as Infant Innocence? ALEXIS. If Poets into Future Things may pry (And no Man can with a more piercing Eye Dive into the vast deep of Destiny) The BOY shall live whose Birth we Celebrate, And, like his Parents hope of him, be Great— But naming Them, our Admiration there Must stop a while.— STREPHON. Speak then, that all may hear; Your Task the Worthy, and be Mine the Fair. ALEXIS. Never was Man more Gene'rous, Just and Brave, With Pleasure less seduc'd, or less his Passions Slave. His open Mind abhors the Courtier's Art, So far his Tongue's from differing with his Heart. No Flatt'ry e'er cou'd his Resolves controul, That servile Sin's an Alien to his Soul: Ador'd in Courts and Cities let it be, 'Tis better to be fam'd for Honesty. His Consort close in his dear Arms he twines; While those whom Inte'rest, or Ambition joyns, False to each other the same Day can prove:— And then his Spirit's equal to his Love. STREPHON. Not greater is his Courage than her Charms, Thus both of 'em the fiercest Rage disarms; He with his Sword can chase the Foe away; She with a Look subdues 'em if they stay. So sweet her Voice, it does like Fate surprize! But who scapes that must fall before her Eyes: Their Conq'ring Pow'r, Alexis, I have known, And fearing to be lost, have clos'd my own.— But while on Them our Wonder we employ, We have forgot out Theme—the Lovely BOY. ALEXIS. No, Strephon—while the happy Pair is shown, We rather make his future Vertues known: For mounted to his Noon, his Manly growth, He shall be a Compendium of both: His Mother's ever-new Resistless Grace, Shall like a Glory, dwell around his Face: And Damon's Truth his Actions shall attend, Wisdom to Guard, and Courage to defend. Thus, full of them an Honour to the Name, He shall be no less early known to Fame. STREPHON. Blest be thy Breath that does these Sounds dilate; And that thy Words may be writ down in Fate, Let us our Thanks to the Immortals give And beg the BOY (as you Divine) may Live: For tho' Prophetick Souls may Truth fore-know W'are to Petition still it may be so; Our Duty with the Blessing Hand in Hand shou'd go. ALEXIS. Then hear, ye Pow'rs! your kneeling Suppliants hear, Accept our Praises; nor reject our Prayer. That no Misfortune may the Child betide, Be Truth his Path, and Providence his Guide. Let not Intempe'rance Rage or Lust prevail To drive Life Onwards with too swift a Sail, Or Pride o'erset him with too strong a Gale. To nothing Sensual let his Reason yield; W'are sure of Conquest till that leaves the Field. Here all his Life his easie Limbs be laid, In his own noble, wide, paternal Shade: The Mischiefs of much Converse to prevent, Here let him wear away in soft Content, At once belov'd, secure, and Innocent. No matter how obscure that Life is past That's Peaceful all, and gives us Peace at last. Add to his Parents many, many Years, And to his Life as many after Theirs. STREPHON. Confirm it, Heav'n!—but let us now be gon, Leave serious Thoughts, and sprightly Forms put on. At Damon's Table Plenty does abound; With Mirth and Wit, and sparkling Liquors crown'd, The shining Goblets take their flowing Round: Thither we'll go—it can be no Offence To drink a Health to Love and Innocence. Our Sheep are in the Fold and cannot stray.— ALEXIS. Nay were I sure they cou'd, I wou'd not stay. This Night to Pleasure let us freely give; Without some Relaxation who wou'd live? The heavy Burden who wou'd drudging bear, If JOY were not alternate with our CARE? To Mr. Mansell and his Lady, on the Birth of their Son and Heir. An ECLOGUE. Written at the Request of a Friend. Thirsis. Alexis. THIRSIS. From the great Town where Wealth and State does dwell, I come, Alexis, to thy lonely Cell, The happiest Tidings in the World to tell. While here your Mind you with Invectives ease, You care not who you lash, or who displease; Why else, O Friend, in all the Songs you sing, Dost thou so like an angry Scorpion sting? While thus your Verse to Satyr you confine, Thy Muse all nobler Subject does decline. ALEXIS. No nobler Subject can employ our Thoughts, Than to make Fools and Knaves detest their Fau'ts. At the Offending all my Shafts are aim'd, And none shou'd be concern'd that such are sham'd. But why this Visit? what's thy happy News? And on what Theme wou'd you employ the Muse? THIRSIS. Daphnis, O Friend, that ever-gen'rous Swain, The Hope, the Joy, and Wonder of the Plain; Daphnis the Bold, the Witty, and the Gay, The Glory of the Groves, and Pride of May; E'en He, with the prevailing Voice of Prayer, This happy Morning has obtain'd an Heir. 'Twas long before the gracious Pow'rs comply'd; Thus Prayer may be delay'd, but not deny'd. Three Tryals of the Fairer Sex were past E'er a Son's born—a Son is born at last! His Father's Hope, his Mother's utmost Joy Have both their full Perfection in the BOY. Cou'd you (for sure you must) these Tydings hear, And not congratulate the lovely Pair? O welcome Day! and O more welcome Heir! ALEXIS. News seldom comes to Country Swains sincere, Doubtful Report does make a doubtful Ear; But this, indeed, is what I did not hear: Or had I heard, to write had been my Blame; For what Pretence have I to use his Name That I but barely know by common Fame? THIRSIS. Plutarch, who such illustrious Hero's drew, Not one among 'em all in Person knew; From Fame he took 'em, and to Fame did give Their glorious Names, which now will ever live: But for his Pen, tho' famous in their own, They had not to our latter times been known. If then by Fame you noble Daphnis know, The noble Youth as she has drawn him show; And while his Wit and Vertues you recite, I'll tell you if the Dame has done him Right. ALEXIS. Then hear her say that an unblemish'd Truth With all the Fruit of Age has crown'd his Youth. So sweet his Form, e'en Women have less Charms; All but the beauteous Dame that fills his Arms. But then his Courage is so vastly great, 'Tis just Amazement such Extremes shou'd meet: For Men that rival the fair Sex in Shew, Have commonly the Souls of Women too, But in the Brightness of this Shepherd's Mien There's a strange Sort of lovely fierceness seen: And then his Wit's so active, clear and true, When e'er he speaks w'are sure of something new. What beauteous, or disdainful Dame cou'd prove So strangely cruel to deny him Love? The sweet Alinda, Queen of his Desire, That sure to wound, cou'd with a Look inspire In other Shepherds Breasts th'Am'rous Fire; That without Pity heard 'em all complain, Relentless and regardless of their Pain; Here found the Shafts her Eyes had thrown return'd, And in the same Seraphick Fever burn'd: For how cou'd two so like themselves alone, Like Heat and Flame, be kept from being one? Not the First Pair in Eden's blissful Bow'rs, Before their Fall, enjoy'd diviner Hours. Thus while these Lovers we with Wonder View, 'Tis easie to believe those Fictions true Which the bold Greeks have so sublimely told; The Real here out does the feign'd of Old. In her so much Good Humour, Prudence, Sense Is seen, and ev'ry brighter Excellence, Amaz'd we stand, all Joyful of his Gain; Tho' we shou'd envy any other Swain The sole Possession of the Matchless Fair, Who, loving him, gives all the World Despair. For as his Youth did early Promise give Of Wonders, if he did to Manhood live; So by a Father's Worth to Vertue warm'd, His Riper Years has seen 'em all perform'd.— Thus far, O Friend, the Publick Voice does go. THIRSIS. And so may I be blest as all is true; So his dear Friendship may I still retain, And so may I not make this Prayer in vain. But if their Joys so num'rous were before, How must this vast Addition swell the Store? Their large Estate, that down Succession came, By this Conveyance of the charming Dame, May go on Ages in the Noble Name; That Name that backward does so far extend, And now is likely ne'er to know an end. How happily does the Prolifick Fair Her Husband's only Brother's Loss repair? Snatch'd hence by angry Death's preventing Spite, But some few Days before his Nuptial Night; His Nuptial Night, alas! that shou'd have been, Had not the pale-fac'd Tyrant step'd between: In the cold Grave he does his Spousals keep; The waking Night, is now Eternal Sleep! But blest is he that on high Heav'n depends! How soon the Gracious Pow'r has made amends! A little Borrows, but he largely Lends. How must this News the Cambrian Knight revive? His Son is in his Grand-son yet alive: That Loss did lop off half a Father's Joy, But 'tis return'd him wholly in the BOY. Alike Alinda's Joyful Parents smil'd, Never no Parents happier in a Child; Happy in Her, and happy in her Heir, A Joy of which they did almost despair; But what's too hard for Piety and Prayer? ALEXIS. Tho' to their Praise I can no Trophy rear, I can join with you in a fervent Prayer. May he, that cou'd so soon such Comfort give, Prove a much greater Comfort yet and Live; Live till he does a Noble Harvest yield, Till his rich Autumn crown with Fruit the Field, Honour his Sword, and Innocence his Shield; The Wathchful Guard that best divert their Aim, When Envy and Ill Nature shoot at Fame. O Thirsis! without Flatt'ry, or Design, This is my Prayer. THIRSIS. And, Witness Heav'n! 'tis Mine. But come, 'tis fit that Daphnis we attend, I came to see thee chiefly for that end: There thou shalt hear so many Tongues rejoice, It wants but Thine to be the General Voice. ALEXIS. I go, but I must make a quick Return; Tho' few, my Sheep must not be left forlorn. And trust me, were it not to throw my Mite Into this Boundless Treasury of Delight, I wou'd not (tho' our Flock's so very small It scarce brings Wooll enough to cloath us all) Leave this cool Shade, this humble poor Retreat, One Moment, to live Ages with the Great; Whose sole Diversions and sublimest Joys Are only Ceremony, Dress and Noise. Funeral Elegies. To the Memory of Mr. John Oldham. But that 'tis dangerous for Man to be Too busie with immutable Decree, I cou'd, dear Friend, have blam'd thy cruel Fate That let such Sweetness have so short a Date! The Flow'rs, with which the Meads are drest so Gay, And are to fade so quickly—live a Day; Thou in the Noon of Life wer't snatch't away! Cropt from the Stalk with all thy Verdure on! Yet not before thy Verse had Wonders shown, And made at once all future Times thy Own. The Company of Beauty, Wealth and Wine, Were not so Charming, not so Sweet as thine: They quickly Perish; yours was still the same, A Lambent, but an everlasting Flame, Which something so resistless did impart, It never pass'd the Ear but reach'd the Heart: Unlike the Wretch that strives to get Esteem, And thinks it fine and janty to Blaspheme, Nor can be Witty but when God's the Theme: Mistaken Men! (but such thou did'st despise) That must be Wicked to be counted Wise. Thy Converse from this reigning Vice was free, And yet 'twas, truly, all that Wit cou'd be: None had it but, ev'n with a Tear does own, The Soul of dear Society is gone! But while we thus thy Native Sweetness Sing, We ought not to forget thy Native Sting. Thy Satyr spar'd no Grievances, or Crimes, Satyr, the best Reformer of the Times: While different Sects eternally contest, And each will have his own Perswasion best, Then consequentially Damns all the rest, Their Love to gain, not Godliness is shown; Heav'ns Work is left undone to do their own. How vain are those that wou'd obscure thy Fame By giving out thy Verse was rough and lame? They wou'd have Satyr their Compassion move, And writ so pliant, nicely, soft and smooth, As if the Muse were in a Flux of Love. But who of Beaus, and Knaves and Fools wou'd Sing, Must Force, and Fire, and Indignation bring; For 'tis no Satyr if it has no Sting. In short, who in that Field wou'd famous be, Must think and write like Juvenal and Thee. Let others boast of all the mighty Nine, To make their Labours with more Lustre shine; I had, my Oldham, not a Muse but Thee, Ev'n Thou wer't all the mighty Nine to Me! 'Twas thy dear Friendship did my Breast inspire, And warm'd it first with a Poetick Fire— But 'tis a Warmth that does with Thee expire; For when the Sun is set, that Guides the Day, The Traveller must stop, or lose his Way. To the Memory of Edmund Waller, Esq. Tho' ne'er so low, or never so Sublime, All Human Things must be the Spoil of Time: Poet and Hero with the rest must go; Their Fame may higher mount, their Dust must lie as low. Thus Mighty Waller is at last expir'd, Both equally Lamented and Admir'd. Long we enjoy'd him;—on his Tuneful Tongue All Ears and Hearts with the same Rapture hung, As had an Angel Writ, or Angel Sung! Here the two bold contending Fleets are found, The Mighty Rivals of the wat'ry Round; In Smoke and Flame involv'd, they cou'd not fight With so much Force and Fire as he did write. Here Galatea mourns;—in bleeding Strains So Philomel her wretched Fate complains. Here Fletcher and Immortal Johnson shine, Preserv'd in his no less Immortal Line: But where, O wond'rous Bard! where is that He Surviving now to do the same for Thee? He who performs that Task ('tis else debas'd) Must be by the same Inspiration rais'd, Write as he wrote, and Praise as Waller Prais'd. Whether for Peaceful Charles, or Warlike James His Lyre was strung; the Muses dearest Themes: Whether of Love's Success, when in the Eyes Of the fair Nymph the kindling Glances rise, When, blushing, she breaths short, and with Constraint denies: Whether he paint the Lover's restless Care, Or Sacharissa, the Disdainful Fair: (Relentless Sacharissa, deaf to Love, The only Soul his Verse cou'd never move; But sure she stop'd her Ears, and clos'd her Eyes, He cou'd not else have miss'd the Heav'nly Prize:) Or whether (where he yet does brighter shine) He shifts this Theme to that of Love Divine; Where we see all his Youthful Am'rous Rage Lost in that Nobler Flame that guides his Age: All this is done with so much Art and Care, So lofty here and so surprizing there, We read, w'are rap't! and have no Sense but Ear! His Labours thus Peculiar Glory claim, As writ with something more than Mortal Flame. Wit, Judgment, Fancy, and a Heat Divine Thro'out each Part, thro'out the whole does shine; Th'Expression clear, the Thought sedately high; No flutt'ring, but with even Wing he glides along the Sky. Some we may see who in their Youth have writ Good Sense, at Fifty take their Leave of Wit, Chimæra's, and Incongr'ous Trifles feign, Tedious, Insipid, Impudent and Vain, Th'abortive Issues of a Crazy Brain: But He, when he thro' Fourscore Years had past Felt no Decay, the same from first to last; Death only cou'd his Vig'rous Light o'er-cast. Such was the Man whose Loss we now deplore, Such was the Man, but we shou'd call him more: Immortal in Himself, we need not strive To keep his Sacred Memory alive: Just, Loyal, Learn'd, Obliging, Gen'rous, Brave; He to our Language first it's Justness gave, And rais'd above Oblivion and the Grave; Which, in Return, shall now preserve his Fame, While Verse can Charm, and Waller is a Name. On the Death of Mr. Dryden. Farewel! thou Chiefest of the Sons of Fame! Ev'n I, who formerly presum'd to blame, Now change my Stile, and Celebrate thy Name: Not that I wrote with Prejudice, or Spite, But might too warmly vindicate the Right.— But die thy Fau'ts and mine;—and with 'em die All Tub-Disputes and Church-Hostility. The Seamless Coat, by our Divisions torn, Is by the Py-bald Sects in Patches worn; Each has it's Rent (and they no more require) Which we, agreeing, shou'd preserve intire. The Way thus clear'd, Lo! Noble Ghost, I come, The meanest of thy Train, to sing Thee home; The Triumphs of the NUMBERS to proclaim, Hoary with Praises, and oppress'd with Fame! Yet, tho' to Honour thee we all agree, What can we add to thy Repute, or Thee? Short liv'd and vain is all th'Applause we give; Our Lines must die, and only Yours will live. When Homer (who is now thy nearest Mate) Was call'd from Earth to his Immortal State, That Life and Glory with the Gods to share, Which has been since so celebrated Here; The Youth of Greece, no doubt, as one did joyn, All Grateful to his Fame, as we to Thine: It ev'ry Breast did warm to an Extreme, To be the first on such a Glorious Theme: Yet not a Name, and not a Line (we see) Of all they Writ has reach'd Posterity: His vastly louder Fame has theirs engrost, As Human Voices are in Thunder lost: The Greater Blaze of Light the less o'er pow'rs, And so thy Verse will once Extinguish Ours. He 'twas that did the Grecian Lang'uage rear To all the Strength and Loftiness 'twou'd bear. The Latin Virgil seated in the Skies, And beyond which it cou'd no higher rise. And YOU, the Third, have brought the British Tongue To run as Copious, and to last as long: Made by thy Purity of Phrase and Sense Not Capable of further Excellence. So GOD his Bounds to the wide Ocean laid, And told it—Hither come—and here be staid. This Fate beside peculiarly you bear, In which no Writer ever yet cou'd share: You saw, your self, your Empire fixt in Peace, And grown so large as not to admit increase: Where e'er their Verse prevail'd, you liv'd to know Your own Receiv'd alike Triumphant too! Diffusing Wit, and giving Wings to Fame, There where the Roman Eagles never came. Scarce did thy Phœbus soar a Nobler Pitch Than what thy own Aspiring Notes cou'd reach: They did not Strain to rise, or faintly fly, But with a Seraph's Pinion wing'd the Sky: While list'ning Angels did thy Lays admire, And wish thee there in the Celestial Quire, Thy Human with their Heav'nly Songs to joyn, To make the Concert perfectly Divine. To grieve were vain! we cannot call thee lost; While Britain stands Thou shalt be Britain's boast. Tho' thy Immortal Mind's retir'd—we find A no less Everlasting Part behind: Your Works and you by a Stupendious Doom, Like Janus, may to Deity presume; Thou there see'st all that's past, and they'll see all to come. 'Twas then we sigh'd when Otway, from us torn, Made all the Swains and all the Muses mourn; Otway! who more than any of his Age Did charm the Audience, and adorn the Stage. 'Twas then we Sigh'd when Fatal Frenzy Seiz'd Thy Faithful Lee—who never Writ but Pleas'd: Tho' cooler Pens his Youthful Ardour blame, Without his Fire they'll never reach his Fame. 'Twas then we sigh'd when Oldham fell a Prey, Cropt by a fatal Blight before his Day: His Loss we all did with Impatience bear, And thou thy self hast crown'd his Memo'ry with a Tear. So we again shou'd sigh, shou'd Congreve be An early Instance of Mortality; And the expecting World (so seldom kind) Lose all the Wonders that are yet behind, In the unbounded Treasures of his Mind. So shou'd we mourn if Southerne left the Stage, So just to Comick Wit and Tragick Rage: Southerne! who Singing Oroonoko's Flame, Has made his own a like immortal Name. But THEE 'twere almost impious to deplore, We had thee all! and Fate cou'd give no more: With Peace, Applause, with Years and Lawrels Crown'd, And Life, nor Fame cou'd make Thee more Renown'd. And be Renown'd!—let different Minds agree, At least, Prodigious Bard! in Praising Thee! So far thou all Beliefs dost reconcile; In this there's no Dissenter in the Isle. But O! what GOD can reconcile the Rest, Our Prejudice, our Pride, and Interest! Our SAVIOUR Preaches Peace, but none obey; Too eager, most, to mark how others stray, When a Good Life can never miss the Way. To Mr. Trowe, on the Death of Madam Goddard. She that, O Friend, cou'd be to Thee so dear, Shall not go hence without a Funeral Tear. Nor is this Verse writ for thy Sake alone, But equally laments her for her own. 'Twas from above her chief Delight did flow, But 'twas your Love that was her Heav'n below. The Charming Eleonora past before, By Angels welcom'd to the Elizian Shore; Remember how that matchless Fair she lov'd, And how she mourn'd her when from Earth remov'd: Her Vertues too she imitated here, And now ascends on high to Praise 'em there: There she wou'd still her lov'd Attendance show; But 'tis not in those Realms, as here below; For among Saints, Distinction's took away, All equal Sharers in eternal Day! No doubt she wou'd have made a faithful Mate, But who wou'd grudge her that Exalted State? Dry then thy Eyes; nor more a Sorrow shew, Which shou'd it reach to her relieves not you. Mourning her Fate; you at her Good repine; She cou'd not be so happy were she thine. In Marriage, Care and Doubt our Joy controuls; Love mingles Blood, but Vertue mingles Souls! By the same Card to the same Haven steer; Then, tho' your Nuptials were prevented here, You'll joyn in a more lasting Union there. To Mr. Lawrence, on the Death of his Excellent Wife. If Beauty, Love, or Wit deserve our Praise, Or Vertue reach th'Applause of after Days, Succeeding Times shall know your Consorts Name, And ev'ry Poet strive to give her Fame. So sweet her Temper, and her Voice so mild, Like David's Harp, it ev'ry Care beguil'd: Sadness she with a Look cou'd chase away, As Mists drive back before the Rising Day. From what strange Cause cou'd such Enchantment rise! What Spring of Beauty yield such vast Supplies! As swift the Motion, and as bright the Flame, Like Sun-beams from their Source, her Graces came. With all this Sweetness so much Goodness join'd, As shew'd she scarce was of terrestrial kind: Beauty but to the Eye does Joy impart, But Vertue sinks, and fixes in the Heart. Ah! why shou'd Fau'tless Lives no longer last? Why shou'd so bright a Noon be overcast? We thought of nothing but of Love and Light, Joy to the Ear, and Transport to the Sight; When Lo! the rising Gloom threatn'd a dismal Night! For now a pining Sickness seiz'd her Frame, Yet sure to do the Work for which it came. The Rich Ætherial Hue her Face forsakes, And frightful Pale, the trembling Empire takes. With falt'ring Lips she moans her last Adieu; A sharper Pang than Death, her taking Leave of You. Two Pledges of her Love were call'd before, And safely landed on th'Elizian Shore: Yet ev'n to her it some Regret must be To go to them, since 'twas to part with Thee. How have I seen thee press her in thy Arms! Bask in her Shine, and revel in her Charms!— All Rapture to the Heart!—You held her fast And gaz'd as ev'ry Look had been the last! Ah! blush not that thy Tears so freely flow; Nature's too weak to ward so strong a Blow. Others, indeed, their Loss of Wives may brook, Where Bodies only are from Bodies took: But O what Reason can that Grief controul, Where Love is torn from Love, and Soul from Soul? To the Memory of Mrs. Mary Peachley. Come hither You who the Fair Sex reproach, And basely rail at what you can't debauch, That in loose Satyr tell us of their Crimes, And say they're now the Griev'ance of the Times; Come hither all; while in my faithful Verse Peachley's Immortal Vertues I rehearse; That you may see how very much you Err, Repent, and learn how to be Good by HER. Ev'n in her Youth her early Worth did show To what a vast Proportion it wou'd grow, When she by Practice reap'd what she in Faith did sow: On whose strong Wings she oft to Heav'n wou'd flee, And by it find what can, or cannot be, Better than all their vain Philosophy. Charming her Form, capacious was her Mind; At least, 'twas something above Womankind. Trace her thro' all the Series of her Life, You'll find her free from Envy, Hate and Strife, A Dut'eous Child, and then a Vertu'ous Wife; A Careful Mother next;—and if we find Any Concern for Dying touch'd her Mind, It was to leave her Infant Brood behind Defenceless, an unequal War to wage With Early Vices, and a Barba'rous Age. O lost, and to be ever pity'd, Young, The World's a Laby'rinth where you must go wrong, Without the Clue of her Instructive Tongue: She wou'd have taught You when with Doubts perplex'd And lost in this World, how to find the next. How easily she wrested Texts wou'd clear! And yet how pleas'd to make the Truth appear! So sweet her Converse, so compos'd and ev'n, That following Her, the Precepts by her giv'n, We found no Roughness in the Paths to Heav'n. So truly Humble, and so fast a Friend, No Human Malice cou'd the Union end. Offence she Pardon'd, no Offence wou'd give, But, like the Dove, without a Gall did live. Well read in History, in Devotion more, And had a Heart that ne'er forgot the Poor. Ah! mourn, ye Graces, mourn your Darling's Fall, The most exalted Wonder of you all! To whom, or where can you for Refuge run, Now she that gave you Life, is dead and gone? Her Charms behind a Ghastly Pale retir'd, As much Affrighting now, as late admir'd: She Cloath'd you Gay, and rais'd Your Honours high, By Beauty much, and more by Chastity. Who of the Fair was ever less withstood Than those that strive to Charm by being Good? Beauty, at best, does but the Eye controul, But Vertue Sinks, and Settles at the Soul. By that alone she did her Actions square, And liv'd and dy'd the Glory of the Fair, With fix'd Submission did her Fate obey Perhaps the first that went resign'd away, With such true Reasons for a longer Stay. On the Death of Madam Pool's Son and Heir; Born Eight Months after his Fathers Decease. If Angels for what happens here amiss E'er grieve—it is at such a Time as this, When what's most like to them is snatch't from hence, And Vertue mourns the Loss of Innocence. Her Consort from her Beaute'ous Bosom torn Had left her Cause for a whole Age to mourn: No wedded Pair e'er led a happier Life, The kindest Husband, and the chastest Wife. For such a Loss where cou'd she find Relief? What Joy cou'd balance with so vast a Grief? See here how Providence the Plan does lay When to the Wretched 'twou'd Relief convey, And take the Weight that loads our Souls away. A Stranger to the Blessing Heav'n design'd; His Form was Still so lively in her Mind, She thought not of his Image left behind, Nor knew she had conceiv'd;—when Lo! a Son Is born, when Hope it self was dead and gone. No Child was e'er more welcom than the Boy, Not wond'rous Isaac more his Mother's Joy; Sent as a Proof of Providence's Care, To shew us Mortals ought not to Despair. By ev'ry Tongue was Heav'n afresh ador'd, For Worth rewarded, and the Race Restor'd, If coming Blessings we by present scan, No Infant ever earlier shew'd the Man, Now all is well, as when the Blushing Ray Of op'ning Light foretels a Smiling Day. But Fate, we know, can quickly shift the Scene, And Life and Death have but a Step between: Alternately we tast of Grief and Joy, Lest this shou'd pamper us, or that Destroy. For now a Mortal Malady has seiz'd The Child, and but by Death to be appeas'd: An Ashy Semblance on his Visage dwells, And trembling Lips th'approaching Stroke foretels: His Cheeks no more their Rosie Hue retain, Yet, Martyr-like, he never groan'd at Pain. The Sons of Art in vain their Med'cines try'd, The tough Disease did all Efforts deride, And Death Stalk't on but with the Sterner Pride. At last cold Numbness all his Limbs possest, And lull'd the Infant to Eternal rest. Nor was he then of all his Charms bereft, A Smile, the Badge of Innocence, was left; A Smile which from the view of Heav'n must spring That Scene just op'ning as his Soul took Wing. Adieu! Sweet Babe, thou who ev'n Fate did'st charm, And of his Ghastly Aspect Death disarm. What Colours cou'd the ablest Painter find To Limn that Face where Contradictions joyn'd? Imprinted Sweetness with departing Breath, And a pleas'd look in the cold Arms of Death. Thus far our Theme requir'd a Mourning Strain But to persist in needless Grief were vain: 'Tis not in this Sence promis'd—Ask and have; Heav'n's but provok'd when Lawless things we crave; No Sorrow ever yet unclos'd the Grave. Grieve then no more, Fair Dame, his early Fate, He has soon gain'd what Myriads miss of late: To many Years e'ven num'rous Sins belong; The Favourites of Heav'n die always young: Secur'd from Lust's assaults and Envy's rage, They're call'd betimes from the Terrestrial Stage; God Measures not our Happiness by Age. By true Submission be to Fate resign'd, Peace ne'er was wanting to a Patient Mind; Such Vertue must have Blessings yet behind. If you'll the wisest of Mankind believe, There is a Time to Smile as well as grieve. Born to attract, your Charms in all their Prime, Not ruffl'd yet by the rude Hand of Time, By Consequence Admirers must produce, First give 'em Love, then give that Love excuse. Their gazing on such Sweetness who can blame? Who wou'd not warm him at so bright a Flame! I hear 'em sigh, methinks, I see 'em kneel, And beg that Pity which the Fair shou'd feel: Smile then, Ah smile! some Dying Lover save, And stop at last the Triumphs of the Grave. To the Memory of that Worthy Gentleman Colonel Edward Cooke. 'Tis Vertue only that supports the whole, For without that, the World's without a Soul: But daily now it grows more faint and weak, And when it fails th'Eternal Chain must break: When great Cooke fell, the jarring Links did twang, And Nature sigh'd as if she felt the Pang: Nor is it strange; he had no other Guide, And ne'er before so much in one Professor dy'd. Nurs'd up in War, yet Truth his sole delight; Courted in Peace, and as much shunn'd in Fight: Death he had seen in various Shapes, but none Cou'd move him to be fearful of his own: Nor did old Age abate the Martial Flame, In num'rous Conflicts try'd, and still the same. But tho' in War and Martial Toil he liv'd, None more than He the sad Occasion griev'd. Our civil Wounds he with Distraction view'd, And Peace amid'st the Din of Arms pursu'd; Three times repell'd, he thrice th'Effort renew'd; In vain—the wrathful Vial by Command, (Who can arrest the high Avenger's Hand?) Was empty'd all upon the impious Land: The very bitter Dreggs were on us pour'd, And what that spar'd both Plague and Fire devour'd. At last bright Truth her smiling Beams display'd, And once more brought to Albion Peace and Trade. But long together England ne'er was blest (O Island! more by Fiends than Men possest!) Like Vipers, we our Mother's Bowels tear, Restless alike in Plenty, Peace, or War. Thro' all Extremes imperiously we range, The Vanes of Notion, and the Slaves of Change. The Church and King shall be to Day ador'd, To morrow this betray'd, and that abhor'd. Reason, Religion (which yet ne'er was less) Law, Policy, and all that they profess, Chop, wind and vary oftner than their Dress. In such a Climate Peace can make no stay, Just shews the Olive Branch, and flies away. Plots, Factions, Strifes and Murders next succeed, And Law perverted makes the Nation bleed: Give, cry the Brave, restore the former War— Sav'd in the Field to Perish at the Bar! In vain their Mars is to their aid implor'd; The Perjur'd Tongue's more fatal than the Sword. Here was a Scene that better shew'd the Man, Than all the Dangers he before had ran: He that in Fields the last Extremes cou'd dare, His Voice, his Look, Demeanour, all severe, As Mars himself were giving Orders there; His former Heat and Name in War reprov'd, And now cou'd bear ev'n Wrong it self unmov'd. Envy, he knew, his Courage must avow; He was to prove himself a Christian now. 'Tis not to be a Conque'rour half so great Our Foes, as when our Passions we defeat: At Peace within; tho' Fortune frown or smile, We know no Doubt, Anxiety, or Guile. Let Towns be Storm'd, or else by Treach'ry bought, By fighting Heroes be new Empires sought, This better Fortitude our SAVIOUR taught, That Injuries with Patience be receiv'd; O happy Life! the Life a God has liv'd! The Life that thither too where he is gone Will lead us up, and make his Joy our own. How will th'Oppressor look when sinking down To Hell, he sees our Suffe'rings on a Throne? Thus as to Execute he'd bravely do, So wou'd he, wrong'd, as bravely Suffer too. When he did Good (and who his Life surveys, Will find he did delight in't all his Days) 'Twas for the sake of Vertue, not for Praise. Never was One, that cou'd so far excel, So little pleas'd to hear of doing well. Restless Ambition ne'er employ'd his Thought; But Peace and Truth he thro' all Hazards sought, Nor did he stop, tho' much he underwent, Till he arriv'd at what he aim'd—Content. Reward he gave where e'er he Worth cou'd find; He look't not on the Linage, but the Mind. His Judgment was impartial, clear and strong, And to old Age his Conversation young: His Mirth was all his Life from Folly free, Nor did his Wit destroy his Piety. Struck with his Presence, Flatt'ry lost it's Guile, Envy wou'd cease to grin, and Rage to boil: The most Flagitious with his Worth were aw'd; Nor durst the Atheist then deny his GOD. So when the Tiger roams the Woods for Prey, If he but meet a Lion in his Way, He straight forgets his Rage, and learns t'obey; The Lordly Beast does unmolested pass, And when he roars stills all the Savage Race. Such was his Life;—and now his Death we'll shew, His Death, the greater wonder of the two! Th'acutest Pangs without a Groan he bore; Not in his Health his unconcern was more: While with a Mind above the Sense of Pain, He talk't of Truths Divine beyond a mortal Strain! Then when the fatal Hour was drawing on, And the last Sands were eager to be gone; When all his Friends lay raving with their Grief, Wishing, alas! but hopeless of Relief; Ev'n he alone his Change undaunted bore, Like all the Changes of his Life before: No Sigh he gave, or labouring Breath he drew, But smiling went, as Heav'n were full in view. O Strength of Faith! in vain by Doubt withstood; O truly Great! and yet more truly Good! All of a Piece!—as 'twere his latest Strife, To make his Death instructive as his Life. To the Honourable Colonel Henry Chiver, on the Death of Lionel Duckett, Esq Where Slaughter, Horror, Fire and Fate have join'd To wreak their utmost Fury on Mankind, You oft have been, with all their Rage unmov'd, As if Life had been scorn'd, or Death belov'd. As if in fatal Broils and fierce Alarms Y'ad known more Pleasure, and enjoy'd more Charms Than in the Fair, the Chast Almeria's Arms: But ah! if Glory only was your Aim, You might have found it in the matchless Dame; Her Smile is Love, and her Embrace is Fame. Yet tho' all Flame, and daring to a Crime, When Gene'rous Duckett fell in all his Prime, That Iron Heart which ne'er before did bend Broke into Tears, and melted for a Friend. From hence the Temper of your Soul we see; For Courage takes not from Humanity: Compassion always shou'd with Valour live, For they can never love that never grieve. Nor is it you alone that mourn his Fall, To all a Friend, his Loss affects us all: Living, no Man before more Praise cou'd have, Or e'er went more Lamented to the Grave. No Means of doing Good he e'er declin'd; His Libe'ral Hand and his Instructive Mind Were two Exchequers, that did well declare The Learn'd and Needy equally his Care: This with new Knowledge adding to our Store, That always open to relieve the Poor. By Nature form'd for Friendship, Wit and Love, He soon in all did most Successful prove: How cou'd he fail to enjoy their Greatest Charms, YOU in his Heart, and Chloris in his Arms? Chloris the soft, the Youthful and the Fair, That with the Fruit of Love did crown his Care; And, sure to Conquer, makes it Doubtful yet Which most excels, her Beauty, or her Wit. How frail is Life, and Gloomy now the Scene That then was all so Radiant and serene? Misled by Hope, when Pleasure first appears We fondly think of many happy Years: Teeming with Sweets, and Youth begetting more, Life seems to have a thousand Joys in Store: When strait pale Death the Envious Shaft does throw, And lays our Airy Expectations low! Yet ev'n 'tis better so, than to be sold To Cares, Afflictions, and a Life too old: When the stale Drudge to Impotence resigns, And his Shril Spouse her Loss of Pleasure pines; When hungry Avarice their Rest impairs, And hoards an Ill got Portion for their Heirs; When Mutual Hatred and Domestick Strife Change 'em from Lovers into Man and Wife: These drink the Dregs, expos'd to all the Crimes Of Age, which they escape that die betimes. Unlike this Life was his now gone from hence, A Life compos'd of Mirth and Innocence. We dare not argue he no Errors knew; But ev'n his Errors had their Beauties too: His very Failings, by a Matchless Art Peculiar to themselves, allur'd the Heart. His Wit cou'd make all Turns of Humour please, For still 'twas new; and manag'd with that Ease, The very Stoick, tho' he meant to blame, Approv'd the Mirth, and warm'd him at the Flame. You best can tell how much his Converse charm'd: Rage he cou'd tame, and Envy he disarm'd: Wisdom stood Mute, and Emulation hung With more than pleas'd Attention on his Tongue; Despairing e'er to reach so high a Flight, All her Ambition was to keep in Sight. Our Souls were mov'd! and cou'd not but admire, How still from all he touch'd, he struck the Fire! But when he pleas'd we shou'd no longer smile, And to sublimer Subject turn'd his Stile, He steer'd our Wonder just as he thought fit, And ne'er was less the wiser for his Wit. Ill fare the Men that misdirect our Sight, That never look but squint upon the Right, And gravely damn all Innocent Delight: He shew'd, and You, Sir, still go on to shew There's such a Truth as—Wise, and Merry too; That all we ought to learn and understand, Is not confin'd to those that wear the Band: He with a Thousand Gifts and Arts was fraught Of which they never read, or never sought. Nor was his Worth to our small Island pent, But travel'd with him o'er the Continent: The State and Pow'r of Europe's Courts he saw, Their Manners, Language, Policy and Law; And brought, to shew he did not idly roam, A faithful Abstract of their Vertues home: But left their Vices, Dresses and Disease, To Fops and Coxcombs they were made to please; They who but Travel to debase their Kind; For what's more senseless than an Ass refin'd? There the Harmonious Art he long had lov'd, He to the utmost height 'twou'd bear improv'd. I see him yet in Solitude retir'd, At once with Musick and the Muse Inspir'd. What Raptures wou'd he breath! what soft'ning Airs! How tune our Souls! and how disperse our Cares! In the two Sister-Arts so amply Skill'd, He's only in the Heav'nly Quire excell'd; The Quire where with ineffable Delight, He sings the Hymns he did himself indite. In vain, alas! (too covetous of Fame) We Poets strive to get a Deathless Name, And with the short Applause of vulgar Breath, Wou'd keep alive our Memories after Death: His leisure Hours found out a sweeter Vein Of Verse, than all our Labour of the Brain: Secure of Fame in his own mighty Line, He there in State will live, and there will shine, Long after dark Oblivion folds up mine. We'll then no more deplore his dying Young, For, tho' so few his Years, his Fame is long. That happy Soul does not untimely go, Adorn'd in Youth with all that Age cou'd know. Beside, 'twere vain his Loss shou'd be repin'd While the more noble Chivers stays behind; Chivers! in whom in fairer Strokes are writ His dauntless Spirit, and his deathless Wit! On the Death of the Famous Musick-Master Mr. Henry Purcell. Make Room, ye happy Natives of the Sky, Room for a Soul all Love and Harmony; A Soul that 'rose to such Perfection here, It scarce will be advanc'd by being there! Whether (to us by Transmigration giv'n) He once was an Inhabitant of Heav'n; And form'd for Musick, with diviner Fire Endu'd, compos'd for the Celestial Quire; Not for the Vulgar Race of Light to hear, But on high Days to glad th'Immortal Ear; So in some leisure Hour was sent away (Their Hour is here a Life, a thousand Years their Day) Sent what th'Ætherial Musick was to show, And teach the Wonders of that Art below: Whether this might not be the Muse appeals To his Composures, where such Magick dwells, As Rivals Heav'nly Skill, and Human Pow'r excels! Vile as a Sign-post Dauber's Painting shows, Compar'd with Titian's Work or Angelo's; Languid and low as modern Rhime appears, When Milton's matchless Strain has tun'd our Ears, So seem to him the Masters of our Isle; His Inspiration, theirs but mortal Toil: They to the Ear, He to the Soul does dive, Like Beauty soften, and like Life revive: Not the smooth Spheres in their eternal Rounds, The Work of Angels, warble softer Sounds! Only, in chanting Crofts! 'tis only Thee, Whose Soul has Seeds of equal Harmony: On Thee (if Poets Wishes may befriend) A double Portion of his Skill descend: You follow fastest the bright Path he trod; Keep, Lovely Youth, in the Harmonious Road: But when the utmost of his Art you find (As you will surely do, if Time be kind) Think there is yet a Nobler Task behind; And Copy (if you'd fear no future Ill) His Fau'tless Life as well as Matchless Skill. What is that Heav'n of which so much we hear? (The happy Region gain'd with Praise and Prayer) What but one unmolested Transport? which No Notion, or Idea e'er cou'd reach: As it appears in Vision 'tis but this, To be oppress'd with Joy! and Strive with Bliss! Confounded with the Blaze of Ceaseless Day, We know not what we think, or do, or say! Endless Profusion! Joy without decay! So when his Harmony arrests the Ear, We lose all thought of what, or how, or where! Like Love it warms, like Beauty does controul, Like sudden Magick seizes on the whole, And while we hear the Body turns to Soul! From what strange Spring did he derive the Art To sooth our Care, and thus command the Heart? Time list'ning stands to hear his Artful Strain, And Death does at the dying throw his shafts in vain; Fast to the Mortal part th'Immortal cleaves, Nor till he leave to charm, the Body leaves. Less Harmony than his did raise of old The Theban Wall, and made an Age of Gold. How in that Mystick Order cou'd he joyn So different Notes? make Contraries combine? And out of Discord call such sounds Divine? How did the Seeds ly Quick'ning in his Brain? How were they born without a Parents Pain? He did but think, and Musick wou'd arise, Dilating Joy, as Light o'er spreads the Skies, From an Immortal Sourse, like that, it came; But Light we know—this Wonder wants a Name! What art Thou? from what Causes do'st thou spring O Musick! thou divine Mysterious thing! Let me but know, and, knowing, give me Voice to sing Art thou the warmth in Spring that Zephire breaths, Painting the Meads, and whist'ling thro' the leaves? The happy Season that all Grief exiles, When GOD is pleas'd, and the Creation smiles? Or art thou Love (that Soul to Soul imparts?) The Endless Concord of agreeing Hearts! Or art thou Friendship? yet a Nobler Flame, That can a dearer way make two the same! Or art thou rather (which does all transcend) The Centre where at last the blest ascend? The Seat where Hallelujah's never end! Corporeal Eyes won't let us clearly see, But either thou art Heau'n, or Heav'n is Thee. And thou, my Muse, how e'er the Criticks blame, Pleas'd with his Worth, and faithful to his Fame, Art Musick while y'are hallowing Purcell's Name: On other Subjects you Applause might miss, But Envy will it self be charm'd with this. How oft has Envy at his Airs been found T'admire? Enchanted with the Blissful Sound! Ah! cou'd you quite forget his early Doom, I wou'd not from the Rapture call You home; But gently from your steepy height descend; Y'ave prais'd the Artist, and now mourn the Friend. Ah most unworthy! shou'd we leave unsung Such wond'rous Goodness in a Life so Young: The Kindness so diffusive he profess'd, That I, ev'n I was number'd with the rest, Prest in his Arms, and kneaded to his Breast. How oft has he delighted in my Lays, And thought th'Unlearn'd Production worth his Praise? Unjustly to that Favour 'twas prefer'd; And it was never else his Judgment err'd. In Spite of Practice he this Truth has shown, That Harmony and Vertue shou'd be ONE. No Words he Set but what the chastest Ear (And none were chaster than his own) might hear. So true to Nature, and so just to Wit, His Musick was the very Sense you writ. Nor were his Beauties to his Art confin'd; So justly were his Soul and Body join'd, You'd think his Form the Product of his Mind. A Conq'ring Sweetness in his Visage dwelt, His Eyes wou'd warm, his Wit like Light'ning melt; But those no more must now be seen! nor this no more be felt! Pride was the sole Aversion of his Eye, Himself as humble, as his Art was high. Ah let him, Heav'n in Life so much ador'd, Be now as Universally deplor'd! The Muses sigh'd at his approaching Doom, Amaz'd, and Raving as their own were come! Art try'd the last Efforts, but cou'd not save— But sleep! O sleep in an unenvy'd Grave! In Life and Death the Noblest Fate you share; Poets and Princes thy Companions are, And both of 'em were thy Admires here: There rest thy Ashes!—but thy Nobler Name Shall soar aloft, and last as long as Fame. Nor shall thy Worth be to our Isle confin'd, But fly, and leave the lagging Day behind. Rome, that did once extend her Arms so far, Y'ave conquer'd in a Nobler Art than War: To her Proud Sons but only Earth was giv'n, But Thou hast triumph'd both in Earth and Heav'n. And now Farewel!—nor Fame, nor Youth, nor Art, Nor Tears avail!—we must for ever part! For ever! dismal Accent!—what alone But that can tell our Loss, or reach our Moan? What Term of Sorrow Prefer'ence dare contend? What but the tenderest, dearest Name of Friend! Hail him, ye Angels, to the Elizian Shore, The richest Freight that ever Charon bore, Tho' Orpheus and Amphion pass'd before. His Skill as far exceeds, as, had his Name Been known as long, he wou'd have done in Fame. Tho' the wide Globe for tuneful Souls you cull, Hope no more such;—the happy Quire is full: The sacred Art can here arrive no higher, And Heav'n it self no further will inspire. To my Lady Long, on the Death of Sir Giles Long Baronet, her Grandson. When rip'ning Vertue soon in Youth appears, And Wit exerts it self above it's Years, 'Tis a sure Omen they've not long to stay; Just shown to raise our Wonder and away! Those Blessings soonest go that most delight, And forward Plants but rarely scape the Blight. But tho' the Innocent thus early leave Their Friends below, we shou'd not vainly grieve: Reason immoderate Sorrow does reprove, Shews we that Way but misapply our Love, For Innocence has better Friends above. If then the Vertu'ous once will have Reward, Why shou'd we think their early Summons hard? The Just are never taken unprepar'd. If sure of Glory at the setting Sun, Tho' he went down prodigiously at Noon, Who, at that Rate, wou'd grieve the Day was done? 'Tis kinder to rejoyce at their Repose, Than wish 'em here to mingle with our Woes. From all the Ills we fear, or feel, or see, Those in the unmolested Grave are free: There Silence reigns, and a perpetual Calm, And there Oblivion drops it's wond'rous Balm, While Lethe flows and lulls us with it's Stream— O perfect Rest! O Sleep without a Dream! Why shou'd the last we the long Slumber call, When Sleeps are, to the sleeping, equal all? While we in her soft Arms repose our Cares, A Moment is the same with num'rous Years: No matter whether Hours, or Ages clasp'd, We wake, and know not how much Time is laps'd. Sleep is but as a Wink when once 'tis o'er; And the last kindly sleep of Death's no more. How e'er the Thought is by the Anxious born, It is but to lye down and rise at Morn: But with this odds—here, with alternate Sway, The Night Succeeds when Light is chas'd away; But there we wake to an Eternal Day! Then mourn not, Madam, the dear Youths Decease; Think of his Worth—then think he's now at Peace. A Life so led as yours of Bliss is sure; But do not murmur he's past on before: The Favourites of Heav'n this Blessing share, Tho' late set out, yet, to be early there. Age does, alas! disclose (tho' ne'er so wise) A thousand Troubles hid from Youthful Eyes. This Sorrow does attend the living long, To stay behind the Beaute'ous, Brave and Young. Scarce one is gone but that another goes; And the new Day still some new Object shows T'encrease our Cares, and to renew our Woes. He mounted at his Noon the happy Sphere, Took from the World before it grew severe; And but in Notion knew that Tyrant Care. But tho' below to Youth Delights are giv'n, Tho' Hope succeeds and ev'ry Wish runs ev'n, Yet what is there on Earth to vye with Heav'n? But tho' your Face no Badge of Grief shou'd wear, Yet we to Friendship may commend a Tear; To Friendship only; for no other Tye Has half that Dearness, half that Constancy. Where two there Comforts on this Basis six, No less Regards can their Ingredients mix. Nearer than Twins! so truly tun'd alike, Both Strings are heard when we on either strike. To Rich with Poor, too distant to embrace In mutual Truth; to Noble with the Base, This sacred Union does afford no Place. The Balance must be fix'd; for Friendships die Without a truly poiz'd Equality. Constant Defenders of each others Fame, In Vertue one, and in their Will the same, No other Fuel feeds this Deathless Fame. Nor only Joy, but there our Sorrows hang, For Friendship most acutely feels the parting Pang. O Ayliffe! we allow Thee then to grieve, I see thy Tears that flow without thy leave! From two dear Sisters your Alliance came, Of ancient Linage and unspotted Fame; Of whom our Wonder undecided stood; That was divinely Fair! and this divinely Good! But tho' such Kindred Blood must firmly bind, You yet were in a nearer Union join'd; For Friendship only mixes Mind with Mind. Love is but Casual, and Desire a Cheat, This lives in Beauty, and that springs from Heat; But Friendship in the Soul erects her nobler Seat: That Band does hold tho' Bodies are disjoin'd— Thus, tho' He's gone, you are not left behind: By Contemplation you may take your Flight To the same Realms of never-less'ning Light; By that may see how there the Happy live, And, thence descended, Rules to others give, The sacred Rules that Portia taught him here; Portia! that Youth for Heav'n can best prepare— But late! O later yet be her Arrival there! What Sighs are these that my calm Thoughts arrest, And hinder their Communion with the Blest? It must be one with more than usual Grief opprest. See! there she stands deploring of his Fate, With trembling Joints that scarce support her weight: All wrap't in Sables! yet behind 'em bright; So Dia'monds shine thro' interposing Night And in dark Shades assert their Native Light. But now mild Zephyr does her Veil displace, And now I see! and now I know her Face! O cou'd I think on Friendships mournful Cries, And not look on his Beaute'ous Sisters Eyes? Cou'd I imagin there were dearer Ties? O I recant! for what can firmlier bind Than Nature faithful, or than Beauty kind? To save his Life she wou'd her own have lost, Tho' ill preserv'd with such unvaluable Cost: Nay ev'n her Beauty was not then her Care, Tho' more than Scepters valu'd by the Fair. Not the Distemper's horrid Aspect shook Her fix'd Attendance; tho' the Red forsook Her matchless Cheeks, her Heart its Care retain'd; The Roses faded, but the Lilies reign'd! Her Tears, her Tenderness, and piercing Moans, Did deeper wound us than his dying Groans: She our Concern did to her self transfer; Our Sighs for Him were drown'd in Tears for Her. Her Sorrow cou'd not make her Charms retire; Weeping, we did her Form the more admire, That very Rain it self increas'd the Fire! But now the Pale-fac'd Tyrant claims his Due; He's gone! and she, alas! is going too! O fly! the swiftest Expedition make! From Heav'n some Angel the Ingredients take, And with th'Immortal Cordial call her Spirits back! 'Tis done! and now again the Matchless Fair Resumes her former Lovely Mein and Air. But O (like Summer's Sun retir'd from Sight) She breaks out on us with Redoubl'd Light! Her Beams confound us with too strong a Charm, And wound us, when, alas! they shou'd but warm! We sigh, we burn and bleed, despair and die— And yet who wou'd Despair when Heav'ns so nigh! Forgive me, Madam, that her weightier Theme The Muse has lost in Beauty's pleasing Dream. But Youth for Youth will mourn—nor shou'd we here With Rigid Precepts wound the List'ning Ear. YOU, more Resign'd, such Dispensations take Th'Instructive Way; and Loss, Advantage make. By long Experience, learn'd in Human Care, You know there's none Entirely happy here. The Soul, like Flame, still bends the upward Way, Immers'd in Night, yet striving towards the Day, Some happy Clime that does her Nature suit; Elizian Groves! and all Immortal Fruit! If Comfort from the Contemplation flows, Releas'd of Toil, to find the long Repose Preposte'rously we Grieve when Vertue goes. 'Tis only for the Vitious we shou'd moan, Who, longer Living, might have better grown. He by his Tempe'rance, Prudence, Wit and Truth, (Vertues that rarely correspond in Youth) A Condescention that all Hearts ador'd, A Libe'ral Hand, that none in vain Implor'd, With Piety, ev'n wond'rous for his Years, Expels our Sorrows, and prevents our Tears. On this Occasion, might we Sorrow use, What is there has more Reason than the Muse? Ev'n She, that Others wou'd from Grief dissuade, Wants most the like Consolatory Aid. He just was grown a Subject for her Lays, She just had tun'd her Notes to sing his Praise; Saw how each Day new Matter he'd afford For Wit, and griev'd she was so little stor'd. She thought a Gene'rous Patron to have found, And in his Name to make her own renown'd: Dream'd of Rewards, as Men in Feavers do Of Wine, and thought the pleasing Image true. Thus from our Hope our Disappointment springs, That we may put no Trust in Human Things. To Sir James Long, Baronet. With the Preceeding Elegy on his Brother. His Death, whose Name you bear, in humble Strains, This Muse lamented to th'attentive Swains, Dilating Grief thro' all the Neighb'ring Plains: His Vertues were to all the Good approv'd, In Senate honour'd, and by Kings belov'd. Your Elder Brother next her Mourning claim'd, Who, had he liv'd, had been as justly fam'd: He promis'd much; but a too hasty Doom Remov'd him from our Hopes, and call'd him Home. Another Brother's Hearse she now attends— But here her Melancholy Labour Ends. What ever Grace or Excellence we view'd, Or hop'd from them, be all in You renew'd: May You their Worth and Honour Emulate, Be yours their Vertues, not their Early Fate. My Praye'rs are heard!—It was your Grandsire's Theme, Deriv'd to Him from your Prophetick Dream, When you in Vision the Three Plants survey'd, The Younger bloom and the two Elder fade. When Heav'n with Age and Fame has fill'd your Days, Some happy Pencil draw your Deathless Praise: That Theme shall kindle with Poetick Fires Some other Muse long after this expires. To the Memory of Mr. James Margetts who died of the Small Pox in his Voyage to Pensilvania. Long the kind Winds the Fatal Point forbore, As loth to waft him from his Native Shore, To which, alas! he must return no more: But vainly they delay their destin'd Aid, His Doom is set, and Fate must be obey'd. For now the Youth is from his Parents gone; O Fatal Parting!—but the Choice his Own. I saw how to their Breasts they strain'd him fast, And wept, as sure th'Embrace had been the last. Nor Counsel, Caution, Blessing did they spare; Their Hands, their Souls they for his Safety rear— But in an Hour when Heav'n was deaf to Prayer! With a smooth Gale he leaves the Albion Shore, And smiling Hope kept full in View before; Nor did he any Danger fear, or find, Either from Rocks, the Billows, or the Wind, Which seem'd for him, against their Natures kind. In vain we wou'd into the Future see, Or open what is clos'd by Destiny. Who wou'd have thought, in this delightful Scene, Secur'd without, they'd find a Foe within, Worse than the wildest Tempest cou'd have been? For now his Bow the Lep'rous Fury drew, And from the String at once whole Quivers flew, Which bursting in their Flight around 'em spread The Ghastly Bane, and not a Shaft but sped: Disdaining any Dart shou'd partial fall, He aim'd the Pestilential Blast at all. In vain alas! the Aid that Drugs wou'd lend! Nor Art, nor Nature cou'd their Charge defend; And it was fatal now to be a Friend: Th'Assistants soon like the assisted grew, And then as fast infected others too. All Hands aloft had now been heard in vain; The barbar'ous Ill had so decreas'd the Train, The Ship as if Unman'd, lay floating on the Main. Ah! wou'd it here but stop it all were well!— They're yet but Lives that we can cheaply Sell, A vulgar Heard, whom Spite and Nonsense rules, The Grin of Wit, and Proselytes of Fools; And if they'll serve a Thousand more we'll spare; Only, O Heav'n! the Youth be now thy Care, Let not the fierce Destroyer enter there, But thy Protection in his Worth survey: As Israel's Safety on the Lintel lay, We strive not to divert him from th'Ignobler Prey. It will not be!—and vain is the defence, When Death arrives, of Youth, or Innocence! The fierce Disease no Magick cou'd rebate, Unbyass'd by Remorse, and steel'd by Fate: With Angry Joy the Luscious Bait he seiz'd, Just as the Lion's Hunger is appeas'd, That sullenly devours, and grumbles while he's pleas'd. The only comfort that did yet remain, Was, that the youth had lost all Sense of Pain: For, (as it were it self too mild a Fate,) A Fever still does on this Fury wait, Which with the Blood a Raging Venom blends, And then in wayward Fumes up to the Brain ascends, From whence a Thousand Fantoms take their Birth; But, Tyrant like, they're fatal in their Mirth: Thus lay the Youth, and in these last Extremes Was forming to himself delightful Schemes Of various things, but all without offence; Reason was gone, but not his Innocence. Ah! better, better far, than 'tis to be At our last Gasp of Perfect Memory, With all our Friends (as they were dying too) Pale with Affright, and shrieking at the view; Nor only that, but ev'ery slight of Grace Staring a Guilty Conscience in the Face; Which only serve, with our Departing Breath, To give severer Pangs, and a more Anxious Death. But now h' had reach'd the Ninth and fatal Day; When in a Death-like Silence long he lay, Till with a lengthn'd heave for Breath he sigh'd his Soul away. Thus in a fatal Calm he Life resign'd, But left a Tempest of Despair behind! Not for themselves they half the Grief had shown, So much his Name was dearer than their Own. But most, O Blake! thou did'st his Fate deplore, Nor Life, nor Fame it self you valu'd more. So justly You his Gen'erous Temper hit, No Tallies e'er did more exactly fit; In sweetness one, in Innocence and Wit, One in our Hope, (as in our Hope the Chief) And now as undivided in our Grief! In vain the fierce Disease thy Life did spare, In vain you reach'd the Pensilvanian Air, A lean Consumption there its Rage supply'd, And you but liv'd to mourn his Loss, and dy'd! Cruel Disease! enough at Land you reign, Nor need erect your Trophies on the Main: That Causeless Tyranny you well might spare, And leave the Shelves, the Sands, and boiste'rous Air, Thy dreadful Substitutes of Ruin there. Or if thou wilt persist, and take Delight On the rude Waves to exercise thy spite, Against some Rock for ever may'st thou be Transfixt by the Avenging Deity, Just where the Billows with a hideous roar Are broke, by Tempests thrown upon the Shore! That there thou thro' all future Times may'st see, Amid'st the Wrecks and Terrors of the Sea, There is no need, accurst Disease! of THEE. See there thy Work where it extended lies! Rack to our Thought! and Horrour to our Eyes, View what a Ghastly Visage now he wears, All crusted o'er! and marr'd beyond our Fears; Of ev'ry Sweet dispoil'd, and ev'ry Grace, That wore but now such Magick on his Face! Is this the Portion of the Young and Fair! Is this the end of all our Hope and Care! His Sisters Wishes, and his Brothers Prayer! Is this the Goodness we so much ador'd! To which ev'n Fate will not a Grave afford, Nor see the sad Remains back to his Native Soil restor'd. 'Tis all too true!—and we lament in vain, They must commit his Body to the Main; Ev'n yet, deform'd as 'tis, too sweet a Prey For the remorseless Monsters of the Sea. O Sight! well from his Parents Eyes with-held! A Sight where Death was by himself excell'd! How had they rav'd his floating Corse to see (Th'extremest Proof of Human Misery!) On the bleak Waves with Ghastly Terrour ride, Th'unpity'd Sport of the Insulting Tyde! Mean while, perhaps, all Igno'rant of his Doom, They pleas'd themselves he wou'd be soon at home, And to their List'ning Ears, not heard before, Tell all the Wonders of a Distant Shore: Quite otherwise, alas! his Fate they find, Sent back almost, by the next changing Wind. Ill Tydings, tho' from distant Worlds they come, Were never known to miss their Passage home. The News his Mother with Distraction hears, A Rage of Sorrow! and a burst of Tears! The Sweets her Visage cou'd so lately boast, With Anguish rifl'd, and in weeping lost! A Deathlike Pale reign'd there without controul, And made her Face the Mirror to her Soul! So much her Sorrow did th'Ascendant gain, Her Travel for him was a smaller Pain: Tho' never was there yet among the Fair, One that deserv'd Exemption more from Care;— But Vertue's not to be rewarded here. His Beaute'ous Sister on her Mother hung, And mournful Accents trembl'd from her Tongue: Nor shall she yet forget to sigh his Name, Till her fair Eyes have found out nobler Game, Dispencing Darts that will not miss their Aim. His loving Brothers, bending with the Blow, Were not the meanest in this Scene of Woe: But chiefly He, for Worth and Learning known, Whom Truth adorns, and Friendship makes my Own. His Pious Father, with erected Eyes, All Dumb with Grief, and stiff'ning with Surprize, Made yet this Flight of Sorrow higher rise! Tho' Balm he pours into another's Moan, He wou'd not, or he cou'd not cease his own. A Thousand Ways in our Distress he finds, To mitigate our Grief; and calm our Minds, But all his Wisdom not himself relieves; Like Heav'n he Counsels, but like Man he grieves! Nor Thee, O Kidder! cou'd thy Mitre save From Briny Tears; the Emblem of his Grave: Not all thy Learning from the Rabbins drain'd, The Scripture clear'd, and Truth so well maintain'd; Nor yet thy Goodness, that so far extends, It all the Bad Instructs, and Poor befriends, And, running still that Circle, never ends, When thy Chast Spouse her Nephew's Fate did hear, Cou'd free thee from partaking of her Care; Thou wast thy self emasculated there! Like Her, rejecting Comfort and Relief, You mourn'd him more than with Collate'ral Grief. But thou! O Father of the Youth I moan! (With Sorrow scarce Inferiour to your Own) If you so much Presumption will excuse, Vouchsafe for once, to listen to the Muse: If a fam'd Statesman, late, was in the Right, The meanest Wits on best Expedients light: Turn then the Tables, O Castalian Guide! And shew the Prospect from the milder Side. What is the Cause of all our Human Care But now to Hope, and now again to Fear? From these two Passions y'are for Life releas'd, As far as they relate to the deceas'd. A Thousand Sweets he had that Blossom'd here, Which now, remov'd into Æthereal Air, Will ripen on, and reach Perfection there. Ah happy Lot!—born in flagitious Times, And yet remov'd before he knew our Crimes, Or took the Bent for Pleasure to entice, When Youth's advancing to the Verge of Vice; E'er Beauty with her Smiles allur'd his Eyes, And Wit had made him cease from being Wise; E'er wild Ambition had his Mind possest, Or Meagre Envy rob'd him of his Rest; E'er he to hungry Ava'rice had been ply'd, Softn'd by Lux'ury, or ensnar'd by Pride; E'er he Distress without Compassion saw, Or ever fee'd one Cormorant of Law; E'er Atheists cou'd to Doubt a God perswade, So visible in all the Works he made; That Impious Race! who yet pretending Sense, At Scripture laugh, and rail at Providence. He left the Stage without the least Debate, Or least Despondence of a Future State: Beside, he dy'd e'er You his Sickness knew, The killing Object distant from your View; By which you from a Thousand Pangs were freed, That must, in Nature, such a Loss precede. For Proof of this, think of your other Son, Thro' what a Train of Agonies you run, When in the same Distemper, late, he lay, Delirious, and just gasping Life away: Not Death cou'd half so terrible appear, For Death is, strictly, but the end of Fear: True, he escap'd; and so your Elder Son— At worst, of Three Y'are but depriv'd of One; Nor He yet lost—but shunning longer Stay, Gone to the Regions of Eternal Day! The PLACE to which so well YOU teach the Way. On the untimely Death of Mr. John Cary, Kill'd in a Duel. That Mourning Verse in which the Dead are griev'd Is sometimes read, but scarcely e'er believ'd: Applause is partial:—Where's the Funeral Line Not touch'd with Flatt'ry, Int'erest, or Design? Lo Noble Youth! (if from your Heav'nly Sphere You are allow'd to see our Doings here) Behold a Friend to sing thy Worth prepar'd, Meerly in love to Truth, and thoughtless of Reward. Some may object, we have too long forborn This Noble Theme, and come too late to mourn: They have but slightly griev'd whose Griefs are past, He truly Mourns that lets his Sorrows last: Then our Delay will this Advantage have, That we have not forgot Thee in the Grave. Time lays the near Relations Sables by, And makes the Mother's Eyes ev'n for her Darling dry, But Friendship to a Nobler Date extends; All Grief's but little to the Grief of Friends. Be vulgar Souls deplor'd the vulgar Way; Of him we have no common Things to say. Heav'n on his out-side took peculiar Care; Ne'er had so fair a Form a Mind so fair: The sweet Composure all Beholders Charm'd, At once the Men were Chill'd, and Women Warm'd; Despairing these, to see themselves out-done, And 'tother blushing they must Love so soon. Early we found him; Nature soon put forth The ample Signs of all his following Worth. Never did youthful Years so truly tell How strangely those of Manhood wou'd excel! But now Mature, and ev'ry Vertue blown, Our very Hopes and Wishes were out-done. As when in April the Prolifick Rain Descends in quick'ning Show'rs upon the Plain, The grateful Glebe a gene'rous Product yields, And universal Green cloaths all the Fields; Quick from the Ground the various Riches rise; We see the Change, and scarce believe our Eyes! The same Effect had Manhood on his Mind, New-ran the Ore, and ev'ry Seed refin'd; A thousand Graces strait came forth to view, And with th'Advantage all of something New. From the same Stalk his Wit and Prudence sprung, And Loyalty sat Charm'd upon his Tongue. His Friendships (which by Worth were always joyn'd) Nor, Envy, Force, or Fortune cou'd unbind. His Voice did a strange Harmony impart, And from the Ear convey'd him to the Heart. Brave as the Hero's were; indeed too brave! O fatal Vertue! what can Cowards save, When Courage can't protect us from the Grave? From such Beginnings, with such Vertues prop'd, What Comfort might his Parents not have hop'd? Who more on Providence have fix'd their Trust, And Heav'n has promis'd Blessings to the Just? A Family on such Foundations laid One wou'd have thought shou'd stand till Time it self decay'd. But Ah! how dimly Fate appears from far! How vain our Human Expectations are! We be our selves but Creatures of a Day! And can we hope our Joys will longer stay! For now th'Affront is took, the Time is set, And now the fierce Antagonists are met. Their Swords unsheath'd, both readily prepare, And, measuring Blades, begin the mortal War. What Skill, what Courage, and what Rage can do, Both Combatants with equal Brav'ry shew. Long did the Conflict last; a Noble Field Was long maintain'd, and both disdain'd to yield. Thrice did our Youthful Hero in the Arm Wound his bold Foe, but meant no further Harm; Honour by him the Nobler way was woo'd, He fought for injur'd Fame, and not for Blood. Mean while th'Aggressor all Advantage watch'd, And, closing, from his Gripe th'Weapon snatch'd; Then short'ning his, with one Accursed Blow, By Treach'ry did what Courage cou'd not do. Down fell the Youth; nor did the other stay, To lend Relief, but left him on the Clay, Hopeless of Help, and bleeding Life away. Upon how slight a Hinge our Comforts turn! How short our Pleasures! and how long we mourn! Patient our Youth, and kind to an Excess, The whole Composure Truth and Tenderness; Yet when in his Good Name he suffer'd Wrong, Basely traduc'd by an opprobrious Tongue, He cou'd not bear it, tho' he much cou'd bear; Patience it self cou'd not restrain him there. Swift to our Ears does the sad Sound arrive, And now the Living seem the least alive. A Death-like Pale o'er ev'ry Visage stood! Despair and Horror seize our stiff'ning Blood, And for a while arrest the Circ'ling Flood! Not one but to the last Excess does show, Unfeign'd their Kindness, as unfeign'd a Woe; Vying in Grief, they mournfully contend Who shall in deepest Sighs lament his Murder'd Friend. Nor does his Loss affect his Friends alone, Th'affrighted Town shakes with a Gene'ral Groan: Fame thro' the Num'rous Streets the Murder bears, And ev'ry Face the Badge of Sadness wears. Next, to the Country flies the Dismal Blast, And Sorrow fixt its Standard as it past; There is no need to bid such Tidings hast. Among the rest, imagin, with the Muse, His Pious Father just has read the News. He, far remov'd, perhaps the fatal Hour He fell was kneeling to th'Immortal Pow'r, Imploring for his Son yet many Days, And for the few h' had liv'd returning Praise: Now see him, struck with Horror, trembling stand, Pale as the Paper dropping from his Hand! From him you must expect no Tears shou'd flow, Stiff with his Grief, and Petrefy'd with Woe! None in their Conduct can more Wisdom shew, Early it to him came, and with him grew; But what in such a Case can Wisdom do? Nature prevails, and there's no Aid from Art; What wise Man e'er felt not a bleeding Heart? Ev'n he, by Heav'n so eminently own'd, After God's Heart, and always faithful found, At such a Time as this cou'd not refrain From Sighs and Tears, but gave his Grief the Rein: Thro' the wide Court his Cries before him run, A Raving Sound!—O Absalom my Son! Nor is he less by his fair Sister griev'd, She, in whose Presence all our Woe's reliev'd! Where e'er she comes Discomfort disappears, We look, and in our Wonder lose our Cares! Repeating but her Name, I now transgress The Rules that are prescrib'd for Funeral Verse: My wand'ring Thoughts to pleasing Notions tend, Admiring Beauty that shou'd mourn a Friend. Deep in her Heart this Blow has ent'rance found, And her bright Eyes in their own Tears are drown'd! But what can hide such Heav'nly Lights from view! Clouded, they dart their daz'ling Lustre thro', Like Dia'monds cover'd with the Morning Dew. Retire bright Nymph!—our Stream of Grief you turn Quite back—what Man can gaze on you and Mourn! 'Tis done, the Scene is clos'd; that Radiant Beam Shut from our Sight we may resume our Theme; Afresh the Sluces of our Sorrow flow, And fresh Invention comes t'adorn our Woe. Mourn all ye Youths your dear Companion gone! His Fate be theirs that won't his Loss bemone! Mourn him crop'd off in all his Flow'ry Bloom, His little Warning, and relentless Doom! Mourn him that was both Art and Learning's Boast; Ne'er were more Riches in one Bottom lost! Mourn that such Worth so short a Date shou'd find! With Eyes all Languishing and Heads reclin'd, Declare that Hope is false, and Heav'n it self unkind! Ah wretched Youth! Ah inauspi'cious End! Destroy'd by him that calls himself his Friend. Nor does his Life alone, or single go, 'Tis a whole Linage murder'd at a Blow. He was his Parents only Joy, the Prop They lean'd upon to keep their Grandeur up! Last of the Line from whom we now can Issue hope! A Line that down a long Descent had run, And but for him might long have travel'd on. Ah barba'rous Wretch! that wou'd no Pity have, Nor for the Present Age, or Future save: Who wou'd to that Extremity have run, And not reflect he was an only Son? Whose sudden Fate more sad Effects wou'd have, And bring the Hoary Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave. This Thought does set his Grandsire in our Sight, Now robb'd of all his Comfort and Delight: Not more was Joseph by the Patriarch lov'd, Nor more bemoan'd when from his Eyes remov'd: Ah that the Parallel wou'd further hold! Our Youth had then liv'd to be Great and Old: This Aged Mourner, too, had found Repose, Which now, in losing him, he'll ever lose. Thoughtful he sits, and no Companion nigh, Nor can the Springs of Grief his Woe supply; His Heart dissolves, and yet his Eyes are dry! His ev'ry Sense the piercing Ang'uish wounds, While to himself he sighs these mournful Sounds. For Thee I liv'd contented with my Cares, The Crown and Glory of my Silver Hairs! Thou wert the Angel sent me to asswage The Woes and Pains that cleave to trembling Age. What have I more to hope, now thou art gone, But that my latest Sands wou'd soon be run? And yet methinks, wou'd Heaven permit I'd live To see thy Murderer his Reward receive— And I shall see it—still the Pow'rs are good; And the first written Law is, Blood for Blood. Here you that cherish an o'erboyling Heat, And, when y'ave murder'd, say y'ave Souls too great, Laying on Providence (that must be just) Th'Effects of your Intemperance, Rage and Lust; See but to what your boasted Honour tends; In Pride it is begun, in Blood it ends. Honour, th'Excuse you for Presumption find, And Lordly Domineering o'er Mankind; Honour! the fatal Tumor of the Mind; From which our Modern Gentry take their Bent, And think they're Noble, if they're Insolent. True Honour (if that Vertue still remain) Does not consist in Actions lewd and vain, In lacquer'd Coaches, or a glitt'ring Train; 'Tis not a haughty Port, or peevish Will; 'Tis firmly hating all that's mean and ill: To publick Good and mutual Aid it leads, And Peace of Mind the glorious Toil succeeds. Where was his Honour then that basely spilt Such noble Blood, and triumph'd in the Guilt? He thought perhaps to raise himself a Name, But who wou'd have his Conscience for his Fame? Tho' fled from Justice to evade his Sin, Can he suppress the living Judge within? Dissolv'd in Lust, in Wine his Mem'ry drown'd, With his returning Sense Guilt will the more abound. Thro' Unbelief it self e'en Sin will break, And to the Soul it's frightful Message speak; Set Future Fear directly in his View, Terror, Despair, and all the grizly Crew: Those direful Vultures on his Soul shall gnaw, And make him wish for his Relief from Law. Mean while, brave Youth, the Praise of ev'ry Tongue, Thy Loss shall be bewail'd, and Vertues sung; Thy Loss! which not alone the Vulgar hear, The mournful Sound has reach'd the Royal Ear: His Gracious Ear did not th'Account refuse, And 'twas with some Concern he heard the News. See but how finely Fate does twist her Chain, And what a Round she takes to right the Slain! Our God-like Prince with his reviving Smile (Return'd victorious from his Warlike Toil) Was taking then his Progress thro' the Isle; Then, when our Sorrows for thy Death were green, And in all Eyes the Marks of Sadness seen. Gracious and good to all; among the rest, He was one Night thy aged Grandsire's Guest; Lodg'd in that Pile that might have once been thine, And down from Thee transmitted to thy Line. Joyful the venerable Man appears, Like Nestor wise, and little less his Years. Pleas'd with this Opportunity, as sent From Providence, he takes it as 'twas meant; And to the attentive Monarch does relate Thy Wrong, thy Bravery, and untimely Fate; Who then, and since has past his Royal Word, He will no Pardon for thy Blood afford: Aloud it cries, and from a Throne e'en draws A King solicitous to right thy Cause. How Providence does of the Just take Care! Our Monarch, who thy Murderer will not spare, From Murderers is preserv'd; HE now does see His Equity return'd with Equity. Justice the Attribute of Heav'n prevails, And no Prince ever better pois'd the Scales. In vain all foreign Force, and factious Hate, Their Plots are crush'd by his Superiour Fate, And France with all her Strength does sink beneath the Weight. But rest, dear Youth, in Peace and Glory rest, Of all that Vertue there can have, possest. But O! tho' rais'd to Paradise yet we Must mourn that Paradise w'ave lost in thee! At least that Loss I more than others find— For thou to me wert more than others, kind. Thou from thy Birth and Business woud'st descend, Smile on my Verse, and call thy self my Friend. For me a thousand Kindnesses y'ave done, A thousand greater yet were following on— But all my Hopes with thee are dead and gone! With thee the very Soul of Friendship's fled! Ev'n Bounty too, does faint and lie for dead; She languishes, she Gasps, and cou'd not live Did not thy Father force her to revive: For tho' thy Wounds to him are ever new, (Firmly resolv'd thy Murderer to pursue With strictest Justice) yet, amidst his Grief, He ne'er omits to give the Poor Relief: The Naked he does cloath, the Hungry feed, The Dole still ready as th'Afflicted need. But let him ne'er so kind and gen'rous be, He shan't outdo me in my Love to Thee: With his my Grief for Preference shall contend; He does but mourn a Son—I mourn a Friend! Job's Children from him torn, was blest with more, The Comforts doubl'd he enjoy'd before; But mine's a Loss that Nature can't restore! On the Death of the much Honour'd Jame Hunte of Popham, Esq, In an Epistle to his Lady. MADAM, Long had your Joys no Interruption known, Peace at your Call, and Plenty all your Own. Ev'n from your blooming Years (if thence we date) We find you promis'd an auspicious Fate. From your fair Mother's Hands your Vertues first Receiv'd their Ply, nor cou'd be noblier nurst: With Heav'nly Lessons she inform'd your Thought; An Angel learn'd, and 'twas an Angel taught. But ah! too soon the much Lamented Dame (For us too soon!) ascended whence she came, Honour'd in Life, and fau'tless in her Fame. Your happy Sire survives, with Joy to see That Loss made Good in your Prosperity By his own Life (an ample Scheme of Truth) He form'd your Judgment, and imbu'd your Youth. Maturer grown, with Wisdom's weightier Lore He fin'd the Mass; and on the shining Ore Imprest so vast a Worth, that now we find Your Form not more a Wonder than your Mind; The best, as well as fairest of the Kind. A thousand Lovers here your Love pursue; But 'twas Martillo met your kindliest View, Martillo! Wealthy, Gene'rous, Brave and True. With him came Hymen Hand in Hand along, To Heav'nly Musick tuning ev'ry Tongue; And I, among the rest, your happy Spousals sung. Swift fly the Genial Hours with Love beguil'd, For twice three Times has now Lucina smil'd: Three of the Fair, and of the Manlier make Three more, their Birth from her Indulgence take, So flow'd your Joys with an unmurm'ring Stream, Scarce Beatifick Bliss a softer Theme! Love in Profusion, Pleasure in Extreme! O happy Life! O more than Mutual Pair! He faithful, as his Soul had centr'd there! And She, the Charming She, not less than Angels fair! On this soft Scene we cou'd for ever gaze, Alternate in our Wonder and our Praise: So far we yet on Earth cou'd never see, A smoother Series of Felicity.— But a malignant Planet now does shed It's baleful Influence, and the Youngest Babe Is doom'd to Death—or rather Life Divine; Nor seem'd, indeed, before of Human Line: So strange a Sweetness on his Visage shone, Nature herself (with Wonder looking on) Believ'd the Work too curious for her own! His noble Father's Image just, as when He charm'd you first, and seem'd the Man of Men. But now a Dying Paleness veils him o'er, Ah! Beaut'eous Child!—but Beauty now no more! So on the verdant Leaf we oft may view, Gilt with the Sun, a Drop of Orient Dew; With glitt'ring Pomp a while it wantons there, And, vary'ing Lustre, twinkles like a Star: But the next fatal Breath that fans it o'er, It falls, it sinks in Earth, and can be seen no more. Enough, enough of Cruelty is shown! And yet one Mischief seldom comes alone, But just like Job's to drag a Greater on. A Gloo'mier Scene Ill Fate will next display; The Infant but prepares his Father's Way. Ah Heav'n! because the Son was bid retire, Must a fresh Shaft be level'd at the Sire? Cannot his Beaut'eous Consorts Tears avert His hasty Fate? And must they ever part? They who so long and fervently have lov'd, And Wedlock to a Heav'n on Earth improv'd? Must they, so truly one, be now disjoin'd? Enough of Torture and Despair we find When Bodies only are from Bodies torn; But Soul from Soul's a Pang that can't be born! O worse than Death! O Agonizing Woe! Sheath, Tyrant, sheath thy Dart, or falsify the Blow! A thousand meaner Breasts stand bare to Aim, There strike, where there is only but a Name, And neither Wit or Worth to give 'em down to Fame: There strike, where thou canst stop but common Breath, And Life's as much Oblivion as their Death. In vain I wish!—see there the Worthy lies, With trembling Lips, short Breath, and closing Eyes! Half shining out, they labour for a Sight Of the fair Spouse, there look their last Delight; Then veil their weary Orbs in endless Night! So much his Passion for the Fair did reign, He for her Sake in Death conceal'd his Pain; Nor breath'd a parting Sigh, for fear to grieve The dear and tende'rer part he was to leave: Nor did she think him going till 'twas past, But deem'd it usual sleep when 'twas the last. There rest! thou Gene'rous, Honest, Worthy Man, There rest! till the last Sands of Time are ran; There rest in Deaths still Mansions, far from Strife, Far from thy Mourning Friends, and swooning Wife, Till thou art yielded up with them to everlasting Life! Mean while thy Praises shall our Song remain, And all the Muses on their side retain: In thy Applause their loftiest Notes they'll joyn, All sure of Immortality—but Mine: My feeble Lays can ne'er enough commend The Father, Husband, Brother, and the Friend! Those several Sacred Ties thy Loss must moan; No further Ties, alas; now thou art gone, Who with so strong a Union kept 'em one. Ah! You, his Beaute'ous Sisters, shew your Grief, Nor let it look as if you hop'd Relief; All pale, and in your Eyes Distraction shown, Deplore his Death, as careless of your Own! Y'ave lost a Brother nothing can repair, Your Vertue only equal to his Care. And you his Children (Children now of Woe!) Weep on!—and Weeping's all the Grief you know; Your Eyes at present only feel the smart, But soon 'twill sink, and settle at the Heart. He's gone, alas! that best your way cou'd shew, That best on Earth did practice what he knew; Y'are in a Lab'rinth, and Y'ave lost the Clue! Hopeless and most forlorn, there now appears His Friends, all speechless, and disdaining Tears: A deeper Sorrow on their Souls does sit, Anguish at Root, and Hearts in sunder split, Not to be sooth'd by Hope, or charm'd by Wit: All other Blessings Fate again may lend, But nothing, nothing can supply the Friend! With him, alas! in the sad Grave does ly The Band, the Soul that knit Society! Scarce Truth it self a more Inviolable Tye! Ah! sigh ye Chosen Few that knew him well, How kept you Living when you heard his Knell! Y'ave lost!—but 'twere no Loss if we cou'd tell! And thou! Ah Thou! the Consort of the dear Departed Man, how shall we paint thy Care! The outward Grief may be display'd by Art! But how can we describe a Bleeding Heart! A Fau'tless Love to Desperation brought! A Soul Convulsive! and a Rack for Thought! This only way we can thy Loss declare! There's nothing but thy spotless Fame so dear, That to preserve a thousand Lives you'd set; And this sad parting was a Pang as great. How Comfort can we to such Anguish give, Perhaps resolv'd no Comfort to receive? A Remedy for Sorrow so extreme Is hard to find, and alien to our Theme; And yet we'll try:—who knows but if our Lays Their Flight to his Transcendent Merit raise, It may divert your Griefs in list'ning to his Praise? You cannot Mourn while we his Vertues show, If you reflect but where the Vertu'ous go: A Goodness so resolv'd (our Wonder here) Must rise to Heav'n and make him Glorious there. In Youth the shining Seeds of Worth were shown That made so far his Future Manhood known; Truth his Pursuit, and Friendship all his own. As Harmony does oft our Cares controul And tune our Ears, so kindness tun'd his Soul; Not parcell'd out but still dispos'd of whole. By Transmigration shou'd an Angel be Degraded down into Mortality, The sweetness of his Temper so he'd prove; So wou'd the Æthereal Goodness Live and Love. Such open Freedom in his Face he wore, His Heart dissected cou'd not shew him more. Courtiers and Courts he still believ'd a Cheat, So liv'd retir'd in his Paternal Seat; Preferr'd to Silence, and in Private Great. Titles of Honour (worn so oft with shame) He shun'd, nor wou'd so meanly raise a Name; But took th'unbeaten honest Path to Fame: In vain they made their Court; he fled their Charms, Blest with a dearer Beauty in his Arms. Thus, pleas'd, his unambitious Hours he past; Only the eager Minutes flew too fast. True, when his Country's service claim'd his Care, As then, when he the Sword of Justice bare, None Noblier ever fill'd the Shrieval Chair: But that o'erpast, to Peace he did retire, And his own Walls did bound his whole Desire. Not that he thoughtless, or inglorious lay, Dissolv'd in Ease, and dozing Life away: With springing Day he wou'd abroad repair. To chase the Stag, or course the Timo'rous Hare; Filling the Echoing Country with the Cries Of Dogs pursuing, and the Game that flies. This Part was sport; but all the rest of Life Was Prayer to Heav'n, Endearment to his Wife, Acts of Compassion, and composing Strife. If forc'd by Business London e'er to see, So long 'twas perfect loss of Liberty: To what e'er Faith the Obsequious Cits are giv'n, He thought such Crowding not the Way to Heav'n. His Converse, like his Life, (our Copious Theme) Ran even on, and never knew Extreme. For Patience still he did his Heart prepare; Nor was it ever wanted—but 'twas there. A Steady Prudence did his Actions guide, A Prudence that had Courage by her Side, A Courage still Victorious when 'twas try'd. In scorn of Pride he to the height wou'd go, But then his love to Meekness stoop'd as low. A Noble Income Libe'rally he spent In ev'ry Vertu'ous Use for which 'twas lent; O Contradiction! Rich, and yet Content! His Hospitable Doors were still unbarr'd; And if the Poor but whisper'd they were heard. No biting Censures e'er employ'd his Tongue; As much he kept his Heart from thinking wrong; But wittingly an Injury to do, Was such a Guilt his Conscience never knew. With this Ill Fate the Rural Hinds are curst, Their Greatest Neighbours always are their worst; But carefuller the Shepherd cou'd not be Of his Own Flock, than of the Shepherd, HE: To strip the Tenant bare tho' others strive, It was his only Pride to see 'em thrive.— Ah short! too short a time!—and yet if thro' His Piety that Little Time we view, 'Twas many, many Years he liv'd in few! O wond'rous Man! O Greatness soon Atchiev'd! But sooner gone! and ne'er to be Retriev'd! O Loss! whose sound thro' all our Albion runs, The Goodliest, and the Worthiest of her Sons! O Loss! that I the Loudliest must deplore! And be till Death repeating o'er and o'er— No more! the Patron and the Friend no more! But whither am I going?—whither stray My wayward Lines, and weep me from my Way? Forgive me, Madam, (if too deep a sense Of so much Goodness lost be an offence;) The way to your Repose I wou'd have shown, But seeking that, alas! have lost my own. Painting his Vertues but conveys his view Back to our Hearts, and makes 'em bleed anew! 'Tis not the Muse that can your Griefs abate, Reduc'd to a much more unhappy State; The Poet deepliest rues the Patron's Fate. Be then your Peace some more Instructive Care;— And Lo! the Gracious Pow'rs already hear: Your Father comes your Sorrows to allay, And thus, methinks, the Oracle does say; He that at once has all the reach of Sense, With all the force of Roman Eloquence. O Daughter! while that mourning Dew distills, You but Repine at what the God-head wills. What ever Fate's to be our Portion here, It grows severer if 'tis thought severe. W'are born with the Condition not to stay; Th'unhappier most the later call'd away. True, were we call'd to Misery we might moan, But 'tis from Mise'ry that the Good are gone. Shou'd after Death the Soul no more remain, 'Twere better so to sleep, than wake to Pain: But it remains, and will to Glory go, And this believ'd, prepost'erous is your Woe. If our Departed Friends survey our Tears, Then your unrest must certainly be theirs; And if not such an Intercourse there be, Why do you shew a Love they cannot see? Were Heav'n it self dispos'd to give Relief, 'Twou'd yet deny it to Immoderate Grief. Compare your Fate with Mine, and soon you'll see I've deeper drank of Infelicity. Your Consort (and so far his Death was late) Had been some Years the Prophet of his Fate; And you were half prepar'd to bear his Doom, As you were well assur'd 'twou'd quickly come. I lost your Mother, snatch'd from Mortal Sight, In all her Lustre of Meridian Light, Balm on her Lips, and Peace upon her Tongue, And Human Hope at full, to keep the Blessing long! Then for your Son, he was a Flow'r new blown; I lost your Brother just to Manhood grown, When (making Lighter my declining Years) I thought to reap the Fruit of all my Cares: Nor to the Grave did he by Sickness come, Cut off, Relentless, by an Angry Doom. Remember my Submission at his Fate, And if th'Example's Worthy, Imitate, A thousand Comforts yet remain your Own, To dry your Eyes, and mitigate your Moan. Your Children, Father, and your Grand-sire live, Your Husband's Beaute'ous Sisters yet survive; A Plente'ous Fortune does thy Guardian stand; With Vertue, and the World at thy Command.— Thy Thanks for these remaining Blessings pay; And if Sollicitous to have 'em stay, Abide Resign'd, for those Remov'd away. On the Death of that Worthy Gentleman Mr. John Cary, of Woodstock. Adieu thou Great and Venerable Man! Never (tho' Nature oft extends her Span) Were known a Sett of Years so Nobly ran: A Hundred Seasons he must backward see, That gives th'Account of all thy History. The Early Promise of thy Smiling Youth, (It's Prospect, Honour; and it's Basis, Truth; The vast Produce of thy Maturer Days, (Always deserving, yet refusing Praise;) Thy Aged Hours he, last, shou'd clearly view; And none that liv'd so many lost so few: Thro' all these seve'ral Scenes of Life there past A Vein of Piety, from first to last; So bright the Flame! In Heav'n the Happy there Were ne'er before so truly Imitated here. Early abroad he did in Armour shine, With Hero's Chiefs, and Worthies of his Line. Flanders was then the Noble Stage of War; And well he flesh'd his Maiden Valour there: A Martial Terror in his Looks he bore; And tho' he smil'd to hear the Canon roar, Yet Truth and Halcyon-Days he valu'd more. Return'd, again to bless his Native Soil, He found a Civil-War laid waste the Isle. Ah foolish Nation! Envy'd by the Rest For Site, for Trade, and Dang'rous to molest; But for a Factious Route all Europe's Jest. Were but the Swede, the French and Dane as free, They'd not be cutting Throats for Liberty. All Rights and Properties that Men can have We all enjoy, the meanest not a Slave; But, by a Senseless and Preposter'ous Care, We plunge in Blood, and wou'd confirm 'em there. By Providence secur'd from Foreign Shelves, We raise the Storms in which we Wreck our selves. Such were the Times when from abroad he came, To find at Home a Rougher Path to Fame. Nor was his Conduct fram'd for War alone, As Mars, so was Minerva all his Own. In Weighty Counsels, and in close Debate, None oftner Sat to serve the Bleeding State; Or more Expedients did propose to bring Britannia Peace, and safety to her King. Be Oxford Witness to the sway he bore, Ev'n Just when Justice was almost no more; Gasping She lay—but seeing him neglect All things for Her, and fearless of th'Effect, Sprung from Her Abject State, and boldly stood erect. Thus for a Time he vast Affairs did wield, Not second to the Struggles of the Field. So wond'rous was his Worth, so thro'ly try'd, He was the Court of each Contending Side. Well for some Noble Families it prov'd He was so Universally Belov'd. Essex, and others were His Pow'rful Friends, Whom still He work't and molded to his Ends: Nor ever fail'd, as often as he try'd, (Whether by Vertue, or by Blood Ally'd,) To save their Lands that serv'd the Royal Side; Or, where their Houses, Corn, or Cattle lay, To turn the Plunder'ers off another way: For Nothing else the Worthy Herded there, But just to make his Suff'ring Friends his Care. O Wisdom!—that, in all he e'er design'd, In spite of Parties, such Success cou'd find To make ev'n Rapine tame, and Envy blind. But Hurricanes too fiercly blow to last; The Rage of War he saw with safety past, And Peace to her Appointed Station hast: A series of Auspicious Years began Their Mighty Round, led by the Wond'rous Man Who a long Exile Patiently had mourn'd, And now thro' shouting Crowds as Gloriously Return'd. With Blessings all around him, on he came; The smiling Infants learn't to Lisp his Name, The Hope of Nations, and the Theme of Fame! Here 'twas our Saint afresh the Pow'rs ador'd, When he beheld the Martyr's Race Restor'd. The Father's Gracious Smiles H'ad early won, Nor less was favour'd by his God-like Son: No servile Flatt'ry ever sleek't his Tongue; 'Twas then he spoke when Vertue suffer'd wrong: Nor was it hard to make th'Oppress'd his Care, Who by his Office had the Royal Ear, Which were the Counsels just, wou'd ne'er refuse to Hear. Ah! had but the succeeding Prince maintain'd The same Advice, H'ad long in Glory reign'd; But Heav'n was pleas'd a gloomy Veil to draw Around his Head, as he on Right and Law. Of William, last, he did the Honour gain To be believ'd the first upon the Plain Worthy so great a Guest to Entertain: Nobly was then his Woodstock Mansion fill'd, And did a Plenty fit for Princes yield. With fixt Delight the list'ning Hero stood To hear his Host—so Old, so Wise, so Good! What e'er Objection restless Envy brings, From an establish'd Worth it only springs To be distinguish'd and approv'd by Kings. But naming Woodstock, next we'll thither go To sigh his Worth, and draw that Scene of Woe. There where his Death they ev'ry Soul deplore, The Young, the Old, the Wealthy and the Poor; The last a Set of Men unheard of there before: For, by and early and a gen'rous Grant, His Alms anticipated ev'ry Want. The Widows Tears were always in his Sight, And for the Orphans he retriv'd their Right. With vast Compassion ev'ry Need he view'd, And their Relief as eagerly pursu'd. A thousand Families his Bounty knew, But still repining he could serve so few. O liberal Hand! that in his Eyes decay (When for Relief he heard the Wretched Pray) Wou'd reach before, and feel to find the Way, In secret so his Charity to give, And cover what the Needy did receive. But as the Poor he rais'd in their Distress, The Wealthy were themselves oblig'd no less. Who ever ran thro' such a various Trust So strangely Prudent, and so strictly Just? Happy, thrice happy for the noble Heir Whose Lands by Trust, descended to his Care: Howe'er encumber'd, soon he set 'em free. By saving for the Heir the Lawyers Fee And using only Christian Equity. What e'er he undertook, Success from thence It always had, and own'd by Providence. So dext'rously he manag'd ev'ry Trust, He strictly kept without the least Disgust, The Tenants Grateful and the Stewards just; A Miracle his Conduct only bore; Shou'd Heav'n Methusalem to Youth restore, That longest Life wou'd see it so no more. Ne'er was He known that Duty to delay But till to Morrow, he cou'd do to Day; With such unwearied Ardour he pursu'd, In every vertuous Way, the Means of doing good. In publick Choices he his Eye wou'd have Only on Patriots steady, wise and brave And to the Senate thrice their Speaker gave; So did at once the double Good Commence, To serve his Country and oblige his Prince. No Passion o'er him cou'd th'Ascendant have, And least of all to Appetite a Slave. Some Intervals, 'tis true then wou'd arise For Wine and Mirth's not banish'd from the Wise: Who ever yet attain'd to many Years, Must with some smiling Hours unbend his Cares: 'Twas by this Method, cheerful and discreet, He made his happy Century compleat. His Friendships always were by Vertue knit; Nor did his endless Business cloud his Wit. With pleas'd Attention ev'ry Creature hung On the perswasive Accents of his Tongue, And he was never thought to talk too long. Nor did his Age his Strength of Mind abate, But rather this did more increase than that; As rising Flames the higher they ascend, The swifter to their Heav'nly Centre tend. His vig'rous Soul, that long had took its Ply, Stood ready bent to mount her Kindred Sky. Not Death it self that nothing sacred spares, Cou'd ever have surpriz'd him unawares. No unbecoming Grief at last was shewn, No heaving Sigh, nor yet a labou'ring Groan; Resign'd he went as Heav'n had open been, And he the beatifick Vision seen, With Angels on the Beach to wait him in. On, Glorious Saint, among the Thrones ascend, Where Truth abounds, and Joy shall never end! Hail Him, ye Seraphs, to your Realms above, Where not as here, we short Endearments prove, But an Eternal Purity is Love! Let those Appointed crown his Reverend Head With Wreaths of Glory, that must never fade; While we, dejected, back to Earth return His Name to Honour, and his Loss to Mourn! No more shall Woodstock (then the Seat of Pow'r) Be fam'd for Rosamond's delicious Bow'r; Nor yet shall Elinor's Inveterate Flame; Or Chaucer's Dwelling long secure it's Name: From Him we Mourn, we'll to it's Memory raise A Real Monument of Deathless Praise: Hereafter, as a Mark of Juster Pride, When e'er 'tis Mention'd, they shall add beside, There, where the Venerable CARY dy'd. And there, among the rest, the Muse has found His Pious Sons and Daughters weeping round. I see, methinks, with what Concern they come To wait their Hoary Parent to the Tomb. A deep Dejection sits on ev'ry Face, And his Pale Hue has tinctur'd all his Race. So when the Patriarch was from Goshen sent, His Num'rous Sons did for their Sire Lament; So wept his Offspring, loud that Heav'n might hear:— Nor less the Mourners, nor the Sorrows here. But who? Ah! who is she that Sighing stands? And with a Conq'ring Air our Look demands? 'Tis she! 'tis she! whose Eyes have Wonders done! The Beaute'ous Daughter of his Elder Son. In vain, alas! Her Graces she'd disarm; Her Sables wound, and ev'ry Tear's a Charm! Loveden the next, and of his Issue last, More deeply seems the Cup of Grief to taste. A Thoughtful Visage she does always wear, But now it looks just like the Throne of Care, Without a Grain of other Mixture there. A Dute'ous Child she first herself approv'd, And next a Wife, both Loving and Belov'd, A Happy Mother, last; her Table Crown'd With Plenty, and with Children compass'd round. Well may Her Consort send to Heav'n his Pray'r For one so Fruitful, Tender, Chast and Fair. But for a Nobler Labour now prepare My willing Muse, and tune your Notes with Care To sing my Gen'rous Patron, and the Worthy Heir. Let others backward Secret Counsels read, Only such Vertue shou'd such Worth succeed. Long for the Rights of Birth he Patient staid, Yet wishes it had longer been delay'd. Ne'er was a Son so much a Father's Care; And ne'er was Parent to a Son so dear. Hardly his Charming Wife, his dearer Part, Fair as the Light, and matchless in Desert, Hardly her Death went deeper to his Heart. Ah! since the Dead are safe, thy Sorrows spare, And let th'Unhappier Living be thy Care. Long have Your Smiles descended to the Poor, As long has Heav'n been adding to your Store. A Gen'rous Temper never doubts Supplies, And Blessings fall as Charity does rise. The Naked from thy Hand their Cloathing find, The Sick, their Health; the Sad, their Peace of Mind: An Inward Balm thy Healing Tongue bestows, And lulls the Troubl'd Conscience to Repose. Who e'er in vain, did on Your Word depend? Or, that deserv'd it, ever miss'd the Friend? Among the rest, the Muse your Smiles can boast, And only there the rich Manure is lost: The sullen Glebe no sort of Culture mends, And no Reward Her steril Toil attends: Eager to tread the Satyr's Rugged Ways, She meets Oppression where she hopes for Praise. How often has Your Gene'rous Hand inclin'd Her Cares to soften? And her Wants to find? How, often with Instructive Counsels, shown The Paths to Prudence, Profit and Renown? How often have you (Honour'd in her Fau'ts) Refin'd her Phrases, and Improv'd her Thoughts? Capacious Mind! O Sight from which there lies No Goodness hid attain'd beneath the Skies. Never before did Fame to Merit raise A Trophy of such Universal Praise. The Sectaries, Grudging, run into the Cause, And Envy Sighs, and faulters thy Applause: Howe'er our Faiths, or Interest disagree, We, one and all, Unite in Praising Thee. O truly Worthy of the Noblest Flight! But Ah! while others his Applauses write, I lag behind, and cannot keep in Sight. They in the Past his future Vertues find, And talk of Thousands that are yet behind; His whole Delight the Good of Human Kind. But since my Strains, I can no higher raise, I'll with my Prayers supply the want of Praise. With a long Series may the Heav'nly Powr's Smile on his Ways, and lengthen on his Hours: After this Loss may He no other see, But all to come be full Tranquility, Free from Insulting Pain, and Anxious Care, And all Afflicted Mortals feel, or fear; Till, like his Father, he at last appears Laden with Credit, Wisdom, Wealth and Years; Then pleas'd like him, depart the Mourning Stage. A Miracle of Goodness, and of Age! A Poem most humbly offer'd to the Memory of her late Sacred Majesty, Queen Mary. Both kind and fortunate the Year begun Her happy Course, and long went smiling on; Fresh Blessings daily op'ning to our View, With Promises of greater to ensue. The Senate did their Soveraign's Wants supply; And ready Grants are half a Victory: That done, he early opens the Campaign, Armies at Land, and Navies on the Main. Where never British Sails before were spread In Hostile Guise, our Conqu'ring Fleets are led. Lords of the Ocean long our selves we nam'd, And now as far as that does reach are fam'd. Spain, whose Armado made the World affraid, Fell by our Strength, and rises by our Aid. Tho' from the vaster Continent disjoin'd, The Balance falls as Britain is inclin'd: If Peace she gives, she does compose the Jar; And does as surely Conquer, if 'tis War. To their own Ports confin'd, the Frenchmen see We ride without a Rival on the Sea. And as their Admiral, their Gene'ral too At Land believes it safest out of View; Entrench'd he lies and fights us by Delay; But let him think of Cannæ's fatal Day: A Day like that, and quickly too, may come, And Paris took, be humbl'd in her Doom, Tho' that less famous Warrior fail'd of Rome. Thus our Affairs abroad:—at home no less The bounteous Year did all our Labours bless. The fertile Soil, like Egypt heretofore, By Handfuls a Prodigious Product bore: Ne'er had the Reaper's Gripe so large a Pull; And still our Garners, and our Stores are full. Mean while our Neigb'ring Foes, by want of Rain To Dearth reduc'd, had scarce their Seed again: Starving and harass'd by their Tyrants Lust, They tremble to his Spurn, and lick the Dust. This Harvest o'er, another yet succeeds, WILLIAM return'd! and Crown'd with glorious Deeds! That Just Restorer of our RIGHTS and LAWS! And hark! the Universal loud Applause Welcomes at once their great Delive'rer home, Our CÆSAR too, from Gaul in Triumph come. Bells, Guns and Shouts in one loud Concert join; The Voice of Nations is the Voice Divine. Scarce sacred Charles, whose Absence long we mourn'd, Joy of our Hearts, more lov'd and blest return'd. Saviour of Nations, Hail! nor have w' implor'd The Pow'rs in vain—you are in Peace restor'd! Thus far w'are happy—hitherto the Year Was not th'occasion of a publick Tear: Almost expir'd, who wou'd expect to find Her blackest Day, and gloomiest Scene behind? It now has Cancell'd all it gave before: Ne'er but with Grief to be remember'd more! Our Sun of Beauty's set! our Joy is done! And with her Life the British Glory gone! Where was the Guardian Angel of these Isles, (On which 'tis said Delighted Nature smiles) Or where was Hers? To what strange Region gone, And left his Charge to perish here alone! Return! return! and, paler than her Ghost, See what the World by your Neglect has lost! Death of thy Absence has th'Advantage took, And dreadfully he grinn'd, and deep he strook! Banish'd from Paradise be now thy Doom, Ne'er to thy Native Seat again to come: Had you been kind our Light had longer shone— But with our Hopes let now our Lives be done, And that way mourn the QUEEN of Britain gone! But tho' thy Ministers their Charge forsake, O Heav'n! thy Eyes for ever are awake: You might at least (but you are pleas'd 'tis so) Have stood between HER and the Fatal Blow; Nor from us by grim Death have let be torn That GEMM, by Britain with such Glory worn. Why do we Mortals Adoration pay? For blessings praise you? and for Blessings pray? If those we dearest love, and highest Prize, Are snatch'd the soonest from our wond'ring Eyes! Hard your Decrees! your Laws unequal made! Why must the fairest Flow'ers the soonest fade? Why must that sacred Life so quickly end, On which the Peace of Nations does depend? In all her Sweetness, Glory, Youth, and Prime, Abhorring Vice, and still redeeming Time. Ah Cruel Heav'n! so little in your Eye, And yet less great in Pow'r than Piety. When the bright Sun hastes to his Ev'ning Fall, Like Age deceas'd, he scarce is miss'd at all. But if in his Noon-Station in the Skies, A black Eclipse does shrou'd him from our Eyes, W'are pale with Fear, and his lost Glory mourn, Tho' sure both Heat and Light will soon return, How shall we then our present Fate deplore? Our Light's extinct, and is to shine no more! 'Tis true, the Stars their baleful Influence shed, And Death's fierce Agents thro' the Town were spread; Diseases rag'd and whet their Arrows keen, And flew in Pestilential Air unseen: But Princes shou'd from Common Ills be spar'd, Not perish meanly with the Vulgar Herd: In Pow'r so like th'Immortals, they shou'd be, Methinks, least Subject to Mortality: Or granting Human Nature to be frail, Prayer is prescrib'd, why did not Prayer prevail? Why deaf, ye Pow'rs, to all our Vows and Cries? Sent up aloud, yet banish'd from the Skies. Ah! may we not too sadly now complain W'ave pray'd with Faith, and yet have pray'd in vain! Cou'd Prayer be efficacious, she had been Ev'n yet a Living, and a Glorious QUEEN! But 'tis your Will, and we submit to Fate; Our Parts to hope, and not Expostulate; Since in all Turns and Changes here below, You still have Ends above our Reach to know: Forgive me, then, that thus I dare to blame Divine Decrees, and tax the sacred Name.— But we may Mourn—that wretched Liberty You cannot to our Out-cast Race deny. Grief seems to be our chief Prerogative, Faithful to Life, and all that Life does give: Your Love and Bounty, as you please, are shown In other things; but Mis'ry is our Own. Hear then, ye Britons, and attend me well, While the sad Muse does all these Wonders tell In which the bright MARIA did excel: Then pale and dying with your Grief, bemoan Th'amazing Loss of so much Goodness gone! Tho' she did move in such a Glorious Sphere, She often stoop'd, and made the Poor her Care, And seem'd to place her sole Diversion there. Her Favour and Compassion did extend, Where'er there was Occasion to befriend. Wide as her Sway, and boundless as her Mind, Was her diffusive Love to Humankind. You, Ladies, that still had HER in your View, And saw to what a Pitch her Vertues flew; O blame me not, that in the Van I place Her CHARITY, that Noblest Fruit of Grace! Above the Clouds it does it's Vot'aries raise, And leaves on Earth their Everlasting Praise: But O! our Praise must now be mix'd with Moan! The QUEEN of Bounty, and of Britain's gone! But tho' this Vertue bore so strong a Sway, Yet did she not more often Give, than Pray: The Charming Suppliant for our Fau'ts wou'd kneel, And we th'Effects of HER Devotions feel. How often has her sacred Knees been bent Mercies to crave, and Judgments to prevent! Still first at Heav'n wou'd her Petitions be On ev'ry Prospect of Calamity. Ah grant (she cry'd) e'er yet thy Vengeance fall Upon these stubborn Lands and ruin all, By Penitence they may thy Rage divert, And make thy Laws their only Joy of Heart. Long they have err'd, and trod in Impious Ways, Prophan'd thy Sabbaths, and renounc'd thy Praise! O set 'em Right! and let Religion be Not thus in talking of, but following THEE. Such earnest Raptures wou'd She, Living, Breathe, And, dying, did in Legacies bequeathe. Who now will for a murm'uring People sue, That grudge both Cæsar, and his GOD their Due? Our Sins have lost HER—we can hope for none! Our Mightiest Earthly Intercessor's gone! So firmly she all sacred Truth believ'd, (O more than Saint!) she ev'ry Month Receiv'd: Fix'd to that Orb, she kept her Soul in tune, And thought she never cou'd excel too soon. So easie all Offences to forgive, Ev'n Hermits die less pure than SHE did live. No Parallel can reach Her, Lamb, or Dove, Nor this in Innocence, nor that in Love. Angels alone are with like Meekness grac'd, And dying Vestals only were as Chast. If those that most abase themselves must be Exalted, and attain the Top Degree, SHE was a QUEEN by Her Humility. Zealous not of her Own, but People's Ease; For Pride and Sloth were her Antipodes. Tho' on her Head she wore the sacred Gold, Her Fingers wou'd the feeble Distaff hold; Nor from the Needle wou'd she turn her Hand, But that and t'other artfully command; The Golden Thread in Rich Embroid'ry Twine, Till it was wrought into some Form Divine, At his Return her Monarch to adorn, And only fit to be by Monarchs worn. How ill will this fam'd Pattern now agree With the loose Race of Lazy Quality? If, Ladies, You wou'd have a Glorious Name, Like HERS in Life, and after Death in Fame, Fly Idleness, and ill-perswading Ease, Nor be too Proud, or over fond to please; Think of the Plainness of your Soveraign's Dress, It neither made her Worth, or Beauties less: If Vertue don't from Death her Votaries free, How can you be preserv'd by Vanity? Think of her Fate, and soon expect your Own; Can Glow-worms hope for Light when Stars have none! If Mercy shou'd some Human Likeness take, She cou'd not a more Glorious Figure make; Cou'd not our Souls more pleasingly allure, Or scarce more Blessings to those Souls procure. No Sweetness, nor no Charm that Heav'n cou'd prize, But sat triumphant in her Conqu'ring Eyes! To gaze but on HER, struck so bright a Flame Up in our Hearts, it yet does want a Name! Not such with which weak Beauties blind our Sight, At once 'twas Love, Amazement, and Delight! In her soft Aspect, and her easie Mien, Were all the Beauties, Loves and Graces seen, And SHE o'er all presiding as their QUEEN: Others they might to our Esteem prefer, But they themselves had their Esteem from HER: They flow'd not to her, but did from her run, As Light from Flame, or Brightness from the Sun. Then, when she spoke, the Air was charm'd around, Musick no more was an Harmonious Sound! To Savage Natures it did Mildness bring, Rage was disarm'd, and Envy dropt her Sting. If fam'd Amphion with his Lyre cou'd call Th'Enliven'd Stones into the Theban Wall, What was her Tongue that cou'd our Jars compose? More rugged, and to Polish, worse than those. Weakness with Strength, the Backward with the Bold She closely join'd, and in a Gordian Fold. But O the Line is cut! the Union's done! The QUEEN of Concord, and of Britain's gone! You, who were with her Royal Converse blest, Must feel this Blow more deeply than the rest; Your Joys are null! the tuneful Voice is ceas'd! Run thro' the Court with torn dishevell'd Hair, Swoon with your Grief, and rave with your Despair! With Sighs and mournful Cries fill ev'ry Room, Then, pale as Death, into the Presence come! Where late you waited on the Beauteous QUEEN, Only the Canopy of State is seen, And that too with dark Sables cover'd o'er, And humbly seems HER Absence to deplore. Let not the Vulgar Sorrow Yours exceed, You shou'd not only weep HER Loss, but bleed! They cou'd but see her outward Pomp and State, Kneel at her Feet, and on her Chariot wait: Yet when the Gracious Sove'raign pass'd but by, With Hands upheld, and Joy in ev'ry Eye, God save HER! was the Universal Cry: Then to their Toil return'd, a-new reviv'd, As if HER Sight had made 'em longer liv'd. Nor did they judge amiss; the Nation took Reviving Hope and Comfort from her Look. But O! no more she'll be in Publick seen! No more be greeted with—God save the QUEEN! God save the QUEEN will now be heard no more, With the united Voice and Cannons roar Echo'd from Land to Sea, and from the Fleets to Shore! Despair and Horror now assume the Place, Anguish and Care, and all the Ghastly Race! That Voice of Melody is chang'd to Moan, And with HER Life the British Glory gone! Cruel Disease! of all Death's Agents worst, By Nature fear'd, and ev'ry Tongue accurst! Ev'n where you spare y'are fatal, leaving still Behind Thee Marks of a most Envious Will, Ev'n those deforming whom thou can'st not kill. Thy Rage, like Winter, on our Verdure feeds, And no reviving Spring thy Blast succeeds. Beauty once gone, alas! returns no more, No Pencil can the Glorious Rays restore That charm'd so soon, and shone so bright before. Thou dost at once what Age is doing long, And harder treat the Beaute'ous and the Young. By other Ills tho' w'are of Life bereft, There's yet at least some Human Likeness left: But when we do thy Barbar'ous Work behold, We know not if the Dead were Young, or Old! From the detestable and loathsome Sight We turn our Eyes, and stiffen with Affright! The Mother knows her only Darling's gone, And tears her Hair for Grief, but looking down She shrieks! and scarce believes it is her Own! By Thee disguis'd, so lies our Sacred QUEEN! No more with Joy and Wonder to be seen! A Lazar! Scarce to Her Attendants known! Her Vernal Hue, and Balmy Sweetness gone! Ye Sons of Æsculapius, boast no more That you the Weak to Health and Strength restore: Vain is your Learning, and your Art a Cheat, At least, 'tis ever fatal to the GREAT: All you can do is but a happy Guess, And a whole College has the least Success. Like a sharp Sword, with either Edge you slay, Oft by your Haste, and oft by your Delay. Those few your Drugs Recover, wou'd, no doubt, Sooner recover to their Health without. You are your selves an Epidemick Ill, And for the few you save, you Thousands kill: To Plagues and Pestilential Blasts akin, Their Poisons reign without, and Yours within. From You 'tis Weakness to expect Relief, Both Atheists in your Practice and Belief. From GOD can Favour on your Work be shown When You so boldly argue there is None? Yet, O (to this Reproof tho' justly mov'd) Had You this Life preserv'd, Y'ad stood approv'd, By Poets prais'd, and Princes been belov'd. Those that wou'd live must your Prescriptions shun; Tho' who, alas! wou'd value now his Own? The Great, the Good, the Just MARIA gone! Adieu! thou best of Humankind, adieu! And O! not only Best, but Fairest too! A long Farewel thy wretched Subjects give, And for thy Death resolve in Grief to live! What tho' our Conq'ring Monarch may restore A Publick Peace? YOU must return no more! YOU wou'd to us a greater Blessing be, Ev'n PEACE was not so much ador'd as THEE! While that was with us it less brightly shone, Nor has been so lamented since 'twas gone! But tho' for HER (ye Powr's) in vain we pray'd, Ah let HIS Fate the longer be delay'd. Those Years which for HER Reign so short did seem, And all SHE shou'd have liv'd, transfer to HIM: Yet so to pray is scarce to be his Friend, Since but with Life his Sorrows will have end! Ah Gracious Prince! when you hereafter come From Gallia, cover'd with your Lawrels, home; When You have done what Y'are prescrib'd by Fate, Enlarg'd our Bounds, and rais'd a Sinking State; Compos'd our Foreign and Domestick Jars, And put a Glorious Period to the WARS; Tho' all the Nation shall in Joy appear, The Court for Your Reception Balls prepare, Will you not grieve to miss MARIA there! Cou'd Peace or Conquest please You with their Charms, More than that Angel melting in your Arms! SHE was the Soul! the Nation's but the Ghost, That but the Shadow, SHE the Substance lost! But then remember—SHE's but Lost to Gain A Brighter Crown, and a more Lasting Reign! An Historical Poem, most humbly offer'd to the Memory of his late Sacred Majesty, King William. The Bards, who at this Time refuse to mourn, For ever after meet the Publick Scorn, With Want oppress'd, and Infamy pursu'd; Tho' all too short to reach Ingratitude. Who shou'd the Muses more lament than HIM That was their Loudest, and most Copious Theme? Who daily did employ their Force and Flame, And yield 'em Actions to Transmit to Fame? Never before had they a clearer View, By giving an Immortal Name it's Due, To make, alike, their Own Immortal too. Remember, Albion, Your Distress of late; At once a Helpless, and a Tott'ring State. And thou Augusta, most Divinely Fair, (The Nation's Boast, and Heav'ns Peculiar Care,) Think how you then were overwhelm'd with Grief, And 'twas found Treason but to Name Relief. The Chast Eusebia too did deeply Groan, And in thy Ruin clearly saw her Own: What less than sole Subversion cou'd she fear? A false and barba'rous Faith exulted here, And Gallia's Tyrant loudly Menac'd there: And that our Doom they thro'ly might compleat, They aim'd at an Hereditary Cheat; At once for Vassalage and Pope'ry meant, And palming on the Land a Wrong Descent. Mean while the Romish Wolves the Fold did range, And ev'ry Home-bred Bigot tugg'd for Change: Statesmen the Jesuits to their Kidney had, Whose Task it was to make the Secta'ries mad, Then on the National Perswasion fly, And set up each his seve'ral Anarchy. Their Prince they thus to Fury did inflame, And ply'd with Stories of Descending Fame, Immortal Crowns, and a Red-Letter'd Name: Buoy'd up by whom he did a Pow'r exert That Stab'd our Magna Charta to the Heart. Thus Ruin all around us threat'ning stood, And our best View was Rapine, Spoil and Blood; Which now advancing, soon the Gathe'ring Storm Impendant hung, and worse than Fear cou'd form. The Bolt was Grasp'd with an uplifted Hand, Impatient to Receive the last Command, Aim'd on the Hated Subjects to be thrown, And make, like Lewis, Will and Pow'r but one. But long! O long be Providence ador'd! A Set of Men that Time did yet afford, Who, when all lay for lost, by Wonder all Restor'd. To the black Bottom of their Plots they div'd, Saw how intended, and by whom contriv'd; Their Secrets in the first Formation view'd, All meant Destructive to their Country's Good: Th'accurs'd Design they saw just taking Place, To root us up, Religion, Name and Race; And in our Room transplanted Irish set, The Scum of Converse, and the Grin of Wit. What Face of Horror must this Change have wrought! What Blood and Rape! exceeding Human Thought! O Reach of Wisdom! Eyes by Angels lent! To see all this! and, seeing, to Prevent! Who here wou'd Pardon the forgetful Muse, Shou'd she this Opportunity Refuse To sing the Men who then undaunted stood, Before ev'n Life it self, preferring Publick Good! Tal?t, the first, she does with Pleasure Name; But all Applause is wanting to his Fame. A Torrent of Renown the Sire began, And his Descendant keeps it rolling on: Alike, He ev'ry Eye with Sweetness Charms, Alike, He ev'ry Heart with Vigor warms; In Counsel This, as great as That in Arms. The next in the same Deathless Page enroll'd Is Dev?r, the Gene'rous, Wise and Bold. Beside Him none more Matchleless in Desert; Beside him none does with a steddier Heart The British RIGHTS and LIBERTIES assert. The Peoples Darling Favourite become For daring Lawless Pow'r, and more detesting Rome. Or?d with Martial Pomp the Nation Charms, And like the fam'd Æneas shines in Arms. O just Assertor of Great Ossery's Blood! As truly Brave! and as Divinely Good! Car?en, next, (but Pondering deep in Thought The Safety which for thankless Times he wrought) Does feebly Walk; yet as he passes on, Is justly Conscious that the Age has shown No Counsels more Successful than His own. O may the Muses long his Worth Regard;— Tho' they're below such Wisdom to Reward. But Sp?er now our Grateful Tribute claims, Ne'er mention'd but among Immortal Names. For reach of Thought and sure Advice Renown'd; His Langu'age flowing, and His Judgment sound. All Popular Applause He does despise; In Private Honour'd, and in Private Wise. A Prophet's Mind His Fore-sight Represents; So clear a View He gives us of Events. With Him the Noble Mor?t we shou'd Name, His Country's Future Glory all His Aim: Brave in the Field, and ready in Debate; None more uneasy with Despotick Weight, Or deeper vers'd in all Affairs of State. Nor must w' omit the Pious Ab?dn, Succeeded by a no less Vertu'ous Son; Who higher yet their Ancient Glory rears, And reaps the Harvest of his Father's Cares. Their long Neglected Loyal Service past, He finds rewarded to his Wish at last. But Dr?t! Dr?t who can justly sing! The Poor's Supporter! and the Poets King! The Man by ev'ry Man of Sense approv'd! The only Universally Belov'd! O Libe'ral Hand! and O Capacious Heart! That can so freely both their Stores impart, That to the Sons of Want, and This the Sons of Art. From these, and such as these, we took th'Alarm; And soon the Danger made the Nation Warm. With Eyes unseal'd we backward Time survey'd, And found w' had been by too much Faith betray'd: A Gene'rous Error! tho' descry'd too late, And Qualify'd to meet a Nobler Fate. Mean while our Hero, by a Wise Fore-thought, Had rais'd Relief, and staid but to be sought. He saw their Pow'r haste to the last Excess And knew 'twas only He cou'd make it less, Our Rights ascertain, and our Wrongs redress. On HIM our Patriots cast their Eyes; and thence Invite his Kindred Arms to their Defence. The sad Memorial with a Sigh He took, And thus, as Graciously, in Answer spoke. The Aid they ask I had before design'd; And what I'm now, they shall for ever find, Like Justice, Steady; and like Mercy, kind. Nor will I Succour by mean Agents send, But go in Person, and assert the Friend; From Cruel Pow'r redeem their Gasping Laws, Nor fear Success in such a Glorious Cause. From thence I had my dearest Earthly Good, From thence my Veins deriv'd their Royal Blood; And Gratitude shall be Return'd with Gratitude. Let others vainly strive a Name to rear By Breach of Treaties, and unrighteous War; By Brib'd Historians, let proud Lewis strive His Infamies and Perju'ries to Survive; Let the false Annals Stile Him Just and Good, Tho' Causeless, He has Shed more Christian Blood Than all the former Persecutions cou'd. Let Others their own Governments Subvert, And throw the Dice by Foreign Rules of Art, Till they have plaid off ev'ry Subject's Heart; I, waving these, will find out Nobler Game, And tread th'unbeaten, Christian-Path to Fame. An Injur'd Peoples Sufferings I'll redress, And after Govern by the Arts of Peace. Justice with Mercy equally I'll mix, And to that Beam the Scales of Empire fix. Or if to War they're call'd (in War they're Skill'd, On Conquest bent, unknowing how to yield,) I'll lead the Way, and head 'em in the Field: No Danger for their Glory I'll decline; And for their Senate's Honour, that shall long be Mine! He spoke, Embarqu'd; th'Obsequious Waves and Wind Were on his Side, and ev'ry Omen kind. Landed, He to our Aid like Light'ning flew, While less and less our Fears and Dangers grew, Just saw his Face, and vanish'd at the View: Prodigious Change! ne'er was a threat'ning Scene So quickly turn'd from Stormy to Serene. Ev'n He Himself (tho' he deserv'd no less) Look'd back amaz'd to see his Strange Success! If ever 'twas a Hero's Fate alone To save a Nation, 'tis a Praise His Own. To Heav'n the Peoples Acclamations ring, And with one Mutual Suffrage own Him King: Their Senate, too, the Land's Contracted Voice, Rescu'd alike, did all alike Rejoice: While Shouts, and Bells, and Guns the Tydings bear To distant Gallia thro' the Trembling Air, And with 'em brought as great a Trembling there. Ev'n Thou, Britannia, wast with Bon-fires warm, And fair Augusta melted with the Charm: Millions of Lights adorn'd her Streets like Day, And She was then the brighter Milky-Way. But while the Land lay thus by Joy possest, Who knew the Strugglings of the Hero's Breast? Who knew but (if it equally were weigh'd) He might, perhaps, have rather longer staid, If He cou'd safely have deferr'd his Aid? More pleas'd perhaps, our Freedom might have grown From James's Love to Britain, than his OWN. O Strict Necessity! Paternal Blame! HE sought not that Occasion for his Fame. No sooner rais'd and seated on the Throne, (There seated for Our Safety, not his Own,) But half a World conspir'd to pull him down. New Factions, haughty, turbulent and bold, The Lees, the Spawn and Refuse of the Old, Their Black'ning Tongues against his Vertue bent, Revile his Name, and brand his Government; But all in vain:—the Work was carrying on, And by Himself, that it might well be done: Unlike the Prince that but in Words does dare, And at Versailles lay Skulking from the War. Here we might all His Glorious Deeds rehearse, And with the Ample Subject swell our Verse, From the first Hour He did in Armour shine, To the Decisive Day he pass'd the Boyne: Namure Retook, it self a Theme alone To last for Ages, and secure Renown: Nor the Pursuit of Glory wou'd He cease Till he had gain'd His End, and giv'n Europe PEACE. Short liv'd, 'tis true; but on a Basis laid, (As far as distant Things cou'd be survey'd) That long had stood, and to the Nation brought A Wealth and Plenty that transcends our Thought; Rich Wines and Persian Silks it wou'd have born, And all beside that cou'd the Fair adorn; Exhausted quite the fam'd Arabian Store, And Landed half the Indies on our Shore: But the most Christian Tyrant cou'd not bear Of a Divided Crown the Nobler Share, But basely, when his Inte'rest had the Call, Fell like a Torrent in, and seiz'd it all. O Wretch! O Plague that Europe long has born! His Treaties made but just to serve a Turn;— But Spain that pleas'd him, soon shall make him mourn: What in that Monarch's Death was gain'd, he views Unlucky Anjou may as quickly lose; While he himself's to just Derision sold, For Proudly grasping more than he can hold: Not so Nassau; who kept his Glories fast, His first Designs not lessen'd by his last. And tho' a Bloody Scene begins to dawn, He's from it Providentially withdrawn; And rais'd on High, to some Superiour Sphere, Enjoys the Rest his Fate deny'd Him here. And now let those who Princes Actions School, Propose th'Advantage He Receiv'd by Rule. His Reign but short, (tho' of all Reigns the best,) With War Embroil'd, and diffe'rent Sides oppress'd. Scarce in a Week his weary Eyes cou'd close; Th'Intestine worse than all his Foreign Foes. A thousand Plots and Treach'ries Malice found T'increase his Troubles, and enclose him round. Abroad, at Home, one Moment was not free From fresh Attempts of Infidelity. For all his Toils this seem'd the sole Reward, For Treasure wasted, and his Health impair'd, For all his Scenes of Danger, Horror, Strife, And Lab'ring for us to the Verge of Life. Amid'st these Ills, by a Relentless Fate, He lost the charming Partner of his State; Her Peoples Wonder! and her Monarch's Boast! Ne'er were more Riches in One Bottom lost! In spite of all he dar'd their utmost Hate, Intrepid, Fierce, Undaunted and Elate, Resolv'd to Dye, or raise the sinking State: The State He rais'd, new strung our Nerves to War; And now we Awe the Nations from afar: With Equal Pow'r we Gallia's Pow'r can face, Nor are our Fathers lessen'd in their Race.— But while His Subjects did th'Advantage share, (The distant War securing Plenty here,) He had but just his Labour for his Care. Immortal Henry got with Ease Renown; We then were up, and France was tumbling down: This took the Reins, (form'd for the High Command,) When we were feeblest, and but just cou'd stand, With scarce Ten Patriots left to save the Land. To Conquer Gallia scarce was then so Great, As but to Face their Num'rous Bands of late, Inur'd to War, and Fortune always kind:— But, like a Tempest singing in the Wind, Our Hero met 'em in their full Career, And once more taught our Vassals whom to fear: From all their Tow'ring Hopes he laid 'em low, And where's their Universal Monarch now? As Antony's where ever Cæsar came His Genius shrunk beneath our Heroes Name: A Prince that but for Right unsheath'd his Sword, Like Truth sincere, and sacred to his Word: A Vertue which Crown'd Heads shou'd always mind, If they'd good Usage either give, or find, Or hope to leave a Deathless Name behind: Their Word's the Chain on which their Pow'r depends And what-so-e'er the Passive Fop pretends, We see 'tis never broke, but all Obedience ends. No base, ingrateful, arbitrary Thought Into his Breast the smallest Entrance got: By Love to soften, and by Law to sway His Pray'r by Night, and set Resolve by Day. His Clemency the most Invectives stood, Only relentless in the Case of Blood. For ever Curst be the Flagitious Tongue That wou'd such Justice stain and Honour wrong, And in the Grave no Peace wou'd have him find, Whose Aim was giving Peace to Humankind. To him the present State of things we owe, And greater Blessings than ev'n yet we know; Of which when future Times a sight shall gain, They'll blush to think we murmur'd at his Reign. As far as Majesty may condescend, A firm, resolv'd, inviolable Friend: His Choice so Prudent, and the Tye so fast, We find his earliest Favorites were his last. Their Foes Aversion, wary he'd Engage, Not yield 'em up to Pack't and Partial Rage. 'Tis true, the most their Countries Good intend; But some make Inte'rest and Revenge their End: By such the Men in Place Ascance are seen, And ev'ry Favourite gives 'em all the Spleen. True British Souls! to Worth without severe, As if all Merit were included there; When he that traces to the secret Springs Will find they've done a thousand partial Things. How often may you Legislators view At once Condemning Bribes, and Guilty too? No matter whether Vertue rise or fall; To serve their Party has of late been all. In vain th'accus'd on Innocence depends; Justice is there—Majority of Friends. A Falshood put, a Falshood's oft believ'd, And he that hurts you Triumphs unperceiv'd: How many have there late been Censur'd known, And cast unheard, for Errors not their own? Thus by our Suff'rage dash'd upon the Shelves, We give 'em Scourges but to lash our selves. Nor her own Usage shall the Muse forget While there's a Charm in Truth, or Sting in Wit. In vain we Good to Humankind intend, Expose the Bad, and Innocence defend; There's no such thing in Nature as a Poets Friend. But tho' Adino yet holds Pill'ory-free, And fattens with the Bread of Bribery, He shall at last have Justice done by me: Better he quick had sunk into the Grave, Unknown a Coward, and forgot a Knave, Than stand the Lash the injur'd Muse designs; Drawn Rogue at length in my invete'rate Lines. Nor are we here from the main Subject ran, The Prince we mourn did hate th'Immoral Man. Abhorr'd the Wretch that misemploy'd his Store To raise the Villain, and depress the Poor: For all alike he did their Rights maintain, That all might share the Blessings of his Reign. What Government e'er let us see before Less of the Idle, Vagabond and Poor? And of the Thriving and Religious more? To all Perswasions his Regard was shown, As thinking any better yet than none: If e'er he let disdainful Language fall, 'Twas on the Wretches that disclaim'd 'em all. Oppression in his Time, discourag'd quite, Cast sickly Beams, nor durst invade the Light: In other Reigns it shot Erect and bold, The vig'rous Plant agreeing with the Mold, The Papist Pension'd, and the People sold. But He, inclining to their Cries his Ear, With just Concern wou'd every Suppliant hear; Who e'er the Person, or what e'er the Want, But only Heav'n it self cou'd readier grant. O Father of thy Country! take our Tears! Nor will the Belgian State refuse Thee theirs; Too much our Loss, as well as Grief she shares; Let youth and Age, in the sad Duty joyn'd, For once shew all the Nation's of a Mind. Nor let the Fair defer the Debt they owe, But in dishevell'd Tresses rave their Woe! Let every Loyal Heart thy Death deplore, The Cry rebound to the Surrounding Shore, O Father of thy Country!—now no more! Weep thou, Augusta, once his Darling Care, In Peace his Safety, and Support in War: And thou, Britannia, mourn the Godlike Man, Who for thy sake thro' Num'rous Conflicts ran, And crowded much into his little Span. Nor Toils at Land, nor Tempests on the Main His endless Cares cou'd for thy Good restrain. Ev'n to the last he no Fatigue wou'd spare, Which Nature, tir'd, cou'd now no longer bear, And 'twas a Pain to draw in Vital Air: With this a Casual Shake conspir'd, to hast The Sands along that ran before too fast! Encompass'd by his Friends he Labouring lay, To more victorious Death an easie Prey. In this sad Scene He yet himself surpass'd; And thus methinks, I hear him speak his last. Thus far I have advanc'd the British State, And what she fear'd, she now does Emulate: Once more she in a Course of Fame shall live, And Peace or War, at Will to Europe give: The Balance long she shall Triumphant hold, Her Ministers unbrib'd with Foreign Gold. On equal Ground you now the War may wage, Wrought up by Me to Edward's Martial Rage. I wou'd the common Foe have wholly quell'd, But Fate for secret Purposes with-held; Pleas'd, I desist, (call'd by the High Command,) And leave the Work to some succeeding Hand. Perhaps it may be Heav'n's Design, (to show How things at Pleasure are dispos'd below,) A Woman may the Glorious Toil sustain, To shame the Trophies of that Tyrant's Reign: For Venge'ance he is ripe, th'Occasion's fair; And to have Safety, you must first have War.— I can no more!—the Pow'r that Right does bless Make her his Care, and give your Arms Success. Hear, Sacred Princess! hear, Majestick Queen, With what Pathetick Words he shuts the Scene! For ever high in Glory let him Live, And latest Ages his Applause revive. To sing his Fame their Voice ev'n Angels raise, Nor thine be less the Subject of their Praise. O may his Genius in your Soul inspire The same Resolves, the same avenging Fire: Your Statues then shall stand with Lawrel Crown'd, Your Name for ever thro' the Land rebound, With shouting Crowds attendant on the Sound: The same immortal Honours then you'll gain; Then you'll restore the blest Eliza's Reign, And France shall feel from YOU the Scourge SHE laid on Spain. A Funeral Poem. Humbly offer'd to the Memory of the Right Reverend Father in God, Richard, Late Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, and his Lady, who were both kill'd in their Palace, by the fall of a Stack of Chimnies, in the dreadful Storm, Novem. 1703. Address'd to Madam Susanna Kidder, their Daughter. I chuse not Madam, this immortal Theme To make Additions to your Parents Fame; Already fixt, the Rage of Storms it dares, Of Famine, Fire, and all succeeding Years: Rather (if Heav'n wou'd favour the Design) I in their Mem'ories wou'd perpet'uate mine; They can from me no Benefit receive, But honour'd by their Names, my Verse shall ever live. But first, before we further go, there lies A heavy Gloom of Fate before our Eyes, Which if we can remove, we then may see More clear into this seeming hard Decree. Nor think that from our Subject we depart While Truth we teach, and Providence assert, But little we'll digress, and soon return; There will be after, time enough to mourn. 'Tis strange that any Christians e'er shou'd guess, Like Turks, of Truth and Vertue by Success: A Prosper'ous Person, or a Prosper'ous Cause They think for GOD, and deafen with Applause; Up to the Starry Arch their Names rebound, With Court and Camp attendant on the Sound. But time, that ev'ry Dispensation tries If good, or bad, has better taught the Wise. Diogenes is yet, with knowing Men, More famous than the mighty Conqu'erour then. Stilpo that, losing all, did nothing want, Enjoy'd a Wealth Demetrius cou'd not grant. Pyrrhus himself must to Fabricius yield, And Cato now from Cæsar wins the Field. Success is but a Glare, which on the Mind Does flash it's pleasing Bane, and leaves the Judgment blind. Her Friends she does in slipp'ery Places set, And laughs to see the Bubbles swell so Great. A thousand Snares she on their Tables lays, And still succeeds where Appetite obeys. One with the Prince's Favour she allures, A sweet that oft a bitter Fate procures: Another, thinking Pow'r the only Good, She dips in Treach'ry, and anneals with Blood. What Understanding Man wou'd Lovis be To have his Crimes with his Prosperity? While in the Heart there Lodges Guilt or Fear, Whether in Slaves, or those that Sceptres bear, No smallest Glimpse of Peace can enter there. Thus not a Life in Wealth and Glory led, Or at old Nestor's Age to die in Bed, Does make us happy;—'tis an Humble Will, Contented equally with Good or Ill; Centr'd on Truth, for nothing Great it calls, But takes with Joy what ever Fortune falls; With Mortify'd Resolves it Stores the Breast, And owns what ever God designs is best. In Life, in Death, in Poverty or Wealth, This Man is still Dependant on himself; And always watching, always on his Guard, No Fatal Chance can take him unprepar'd: Nay, tho' his Doom in Thunder shou'd arrive, His Sacred Mem'ory wou'd for ever live: Live then, O Kidder! honour'd in thy Fame, An Envy'd, late, but now a Glorious Name! But some, perhaps may this Objection raise How are the Good rewarded in their Praise: Thro' a long Life pursu'd with causeless Blame What Comfort have they after Death from Fame? 'Tis true, Receiv'd into Celestial Bow'rs, They who have Praise from Angels need not Ours; Triumphant, there they take their Seats in Bliss, And in that World transcend th'Applause of This. But who can thence presume to make it clear Their Happiness forbids our Duty here? Shall their Reward for having Nobly done Stop us from going whither They are gone? For he that Praise to Right'eous Men denies, To Right'eous Deeds but heavily will rise. Think on the Mighty dead, and soon you'll know, The Fame of Vertu'ous Men makes others so. Who hears how Socrates undaunted stood, And gloriously for Truth resign'd his Blood, But feels within Resolves of being Good? What faintness, what despondence and debate, Wou'd yet remain about a future State, But for the Saints? and their assurance there Of Glory, for a Life of Vertue here? How cou'd Whips, Racks and Flames be born of Yore, And now again on Gallia's horrid shore, But for th'Illustrious Patterns gone before? The Martyrs, who with Smiles resign'd their Breath, Proud to confirm their Doctrin with their Death. No matter by what dismal Chance we fall, The thing is being ready for the Call; What ever way, we then our Fate receive, Yet, so to Die, eternally we live: Live then, O Kidder! honour'd in thy Fame, An humble, late; and now a glorious Name! But next there comes a set of Men in view, Who Dictate as the Mind of GOD they knew; Either his Thoughts they'll level with their own, Or else, more impiously allow him none. Our holy Prelate, oft, by strictest Rules, Had prov'd these daring Wretches worse than Fools: Hence on his Death they have their Censures given As an immediate Judgment sent from Heav'n. But how, alas! can finite Opticks see Into th'intentions of the Deitie? If we cou'd think for GOD, we then were more than HE We can but Judge of Him (and not beyond) As in his gracious Will reveal'd he's found; In which w'are told to dash our amplest Pow'rs. Our Ways are not his Ways, nor yet his Thoughts are Ours. Can it be possible a human Breast Shou'd be with such a devilish Spite possest (What e'er the fancy'd Provocation were) To carry on a damn'd Revenge so far! O Stain to Manhood! everlasting Shame! A Crime! for which no Language knows a Name! 'Twas well Elijah left the Earthly Stage, And went to Glory in a gene'rous Age; For he that like our sacred Prelate wou'd Suppress the Ill, and but advance the Good, Had he been by our Atheists seen retire, Snatch'd from the Earth in circling Flames of Fire, What ever names the Coach and Steeds might bear, They wou'd have thought some Fiend his Charioteer. But where is first, the Bowels to apply? Such Accidents so far from Charity? Where is the Man that has the better sped, Or been esteem'd the more Politely Bred, For his insulting basely on the Dead? Or where must we retire Repose to have, If it must be deny'd us in the Grave? Next where's the Truth, when Men are torn away By Storms at Land, or Hurricanes at Sea, To argue 'twas their Sins that did provoke The Wrath of Heav'n to an immediate Stroke? Why shou'd the Winds and Tempests, when they Jarr, Be less impartial than the Rage of War? If Slaughter did distinguish where to Prey, Why was the good Josiah torn away When Peace and Truth so much requir'd his Stay? Urge not that Necho warn'd him to forbear, Why shou'd he think the Tyrant was a Seer? When the late civil Fury rag'd so wide, How can we think that Right th'Event did Guide, That saw the juster was the Conquer'd Side? When Pestilential Blasts infect the Skie, Where can the Just from the Contagion fly When Life's destroy'd by Life, and Breathing is to Die? When all in Ashes our Emporium lay, Did the fierce Flames distinguish in their Way? Did not the Brothel, Temple, and the Tomb, Sink down, Promiscuous in the general Doom? Hills have been known, e'er now, on Towns to fall, Where Poor and Rich, the Mighty and the Small, In one Tremendous Grave have perish'd all! With equal Terrour oft the Sea o'erflows, And does Un-people Regions as it goes, Shepherd and Sheep, the Unjust, the Good and Great, Without Regard, are Level'd in their Fate. And so by Earthquakes, if you but enquire, You'll find whole Cities have been lost entire, Sunk in the Earth at one prodigious Gape, And not a Lot been suffer'd to Escape. It is not then, the Swift that win the Race, Nor yet the Strong will always Victo'ry Grace; 'Tis not the Wise can ward a wanting Fate, And Riches on the Prudent scorn to wait; Nor yet will Favour on the Skillful fall, But Time and Chance promiscuous happens to 'em all. And so of Course, no Christian can pretend To Pick and Cull the Method of his End. Live then, O Kidder! honour'd in thy Fame, An Envy'd late; but now a glorious Name. Another Class will say, all this we know, But where's the Reason why it shou'd be so? For if both on the Good and Bad there wait, As you have argu'd, one promiscuous Fate, Where is the Justice of the Pow'rs above, And Promis'd Blessings to the Men they Love? What can we say to Dispensations that We see are hard, yet Justify'd by Fate? Why shou'd just Regulus deserted be, And Clodius purely rise by Infamy? Why shou'd Great Tully to the Tomb be hurl'd, And Antony that kill'd him, rule the World? Why shou'd old Ce?cil grow unjustly Great, And Rawleigh perish by a Partial Fate? Why shou'd our Royal Martyr lose his Head And a Rump Senate Govern in his Stead? Why by a Storm must Kidder's Being cease, And O?ts enjoy Protection, Health and Peace? Strange! that no differ'ence in this Case was had Between so Good, and Infamously bad! Dark are the Ways of Providence, and we But blind our Eyes in Searching Means to see. Perverse Mistake! for first 'tis understood, That if such Chances happen to the Good, The Bad, (tho' willing to extend their Date,) Must see they are not Privileg'd from Fate, So make, of Course, Provision for a Future State. For some there are that Scarce wou'd ever mend, Did not such Terrors warn 'em of their End. His Entrance into Joy he well begins, Well does he lose his Breath, and doubly wins, Whose Dying frights the Living from their Sins; Around him, then, he for Repentance calls, And, Sampson-like, he Conquers as he falls. Then for the Vertuous, it does plainly prove 'Tis wisely done to place their Hopes above; Since, if prepar'd to mount the Realms of Light A sudden Call, but Swifter Wings their Flight; As thine O Kidder! and thy Vertuous Dames; From Mortal pass'd into Immortal Names! If Heav'n shou'd open all it's Secrets here, What cou'd we further know by being there? Enough is always shown us to convince The boldest of the Care of Providence. Where is the Christian that so little swerves But he enjoys much more than he deserves; But if our Arguing seem in this too wide (Since Partial Men will by themselves be try'd) We'll follow in the rest a Closer Guide. Did you Create your self? or did your Sire? Or yet did his? So upward still enquire, Till, at the last you can ascend no higher; There when you come, 'tis Manifestly shown Our first Producer must be God alone: Of his Free Pleasure 'twas that Man arose, Our Frames he fashion'd and our Minds he knows; And may, at Pleasure, as his Own, dispose Either to Life, or Death; to Rise or Fall; To Good, or Ill;—or rather, what we Evil call: For by his Mercies in our Saviour shown, He has deny'd the Means of Grace to None; Whether we bend with Age, or strive with Care, We all have Strength to fix our Anchor there, Or may have strength by Piety and Pray'r: W'are not Compell'd or Good, or Bad to be; Left to himself, Man is an Agent free, His Vertue else were but Necessity. What Reason then to Murmur at our Doom? When let the best, or worst Condition come, We have within our Reach an Everlasting Home. A Thousand various Ways is Fortune bound, A Thousand Ways she's lost, a Thousand found, And ev'ery Way her ever Restless Wheel goes round: There is no fixing on a Certain State In such a flowing, and Reflux of Fate. Some by a Happy Doom She marks for Poor, And some, like Crassus, wallow in their Store: Some to Distress she bows with Anguish down, And lifts from Dunghills others to a Throne: Some with hard Labour she enures to toil, On others with Perpetual Ease does smile: On some She Crosses, Loss, and Danger sends And some surrounds with Honour, Pow'r and Friends: Some from long War are brought with safety home, And the first Charge leads others to the Tomb: On some Grey Hairs to Nestor's Age attend, And some in all their Bloom are hurry'd to their End. Yet, Notwithstanding, vain is He, and Blind, Who to the Heav'nly Pleasure not Resign'd, Thinks Justice Deaf, and Providence unkind. It is but equal ev'ry One shou'd here His Portion of the Common Burden bear Which either Choice, or Chance, allots to be his share. To strive from Cares to be exempt is vain, And he but Raves that Struggles with his Chain. Who ever takes his Fortune with Content, Will find that Fortune Graciously is meant; And that in any Human State beside His Hopes had either gone too far, or Wide. The Spirits of the Poor it must compose To find the Great as Liable to Woes; That their high States we can uncertain call, (Which oft must dash their Noblest Sweets with Gall, While they who ly so low are plac'd above a Fall. Or Granting, as by some it is confess'd That Vice does Mount while Vertue is depress'd, What Argument for Doubt can thence arise To Shock the Good, or discompose the Wise? If all things fell in just Proportion here, There needs no future State to make it clear An equal Distribution can be only there. If Fortune held her Scales exactly ev'n, She soon wou'd stifle all Appeals to Heav'n; And by a Fate yet darker and severe, Take from the Good their Hope, and Bad their Fear. What Man on Earth can say his Fortune's hard If his Belief is always thus prepar'd? There's One above that knows, and will Reward. But after all, what e'er our Stations are, Whether we fall by Peace, or rise by War, Who, of the Wisest, can presume to tell If for himself he cou'd have chose so well? The thoughtless Fry, that Wealthy wish to be, See not the Snares that wait Prosperity: Nothing on Earth can more perversely join Than Store of Ignorance with Store of Coin. The Honest Humble Man, of obscure Fate, Might be a Knave if rais'd to Steer the State, And peel the Land an Ill-got Wealth to hast; For Solon's now, and Numa's Days are past. The Youth that dies a Christian Sound and Strong, Might be an Atheist, had his Life been long; And he that's Vertu'ous Old, might have dy'd wicked Young. The Wretch in Chains that Liberty wou'd have, May to that Liberty be worse a Slave, If he will led in sinful Shackles be, And cross the Blessing of his being Free. The Client, when his Council's Fees are paid, Repines he is not of that gainful Trade; Forgetting he'll at Heav'n be soonest far, That stays not by the Way, to wrangle at the Bar. Suppose a Man (his Ev'ning Service o'er) Shou'd lay him down to Sleep and Wake no more; Were it not better than to Sigh and Groan His Soul away with Aches, Gout and Stone? Distended ev'ry Arte'ry, Nerve and Vein, And only kept alive to feel the force of Pain? Beside, we need not listen from afar To hear the present Sound is Universal War! A little time will let the Nations see All Marks of Ruin, Blood and Cruelty: Why shou'd we think it then an angry Doom That frees the Righteous from the Ills to come? Gone to the Place where all their Troubles cease, And resting on eternal Beds of Peace! Hail then, O Kidder! honour'd in thy Fame, And Hail as loud to Thee, O Vertu'ous Dame! No less than his an Everlasting Name! The Way thus clear'd, and all Objection Dumb, Lo! Noble Pair; the weeping Muse does come To pay her latest Duty on your Tomb; To sigh your Worth, and in sad Numbers tell Our Loss;—and by how strange a Fate you fell! 'Twas Night, and in secure Repose we lay, Or so we thought, and hop'd a smiling Day; When Lo! so many Mercies vainly past, Th'Almighty, when He saw we Sinn'd so fast, To Justice gave the lengthen'd Reins at last: Loth we shou'd split on any Human Shelf, He kindly took our Chast'ning on Himself, As he did Israel once at David's Prayer;— Nor less his Wonders and his Blessing here! But now the Winds have took his fierce Commands, And swiftly burst their Subterranean Bands; Madly enrag'd, they scow'r the Fields of Air, And with hoarse Murmurs hurry to the War: Their Signal past, thro' the vast Space they fly, And loud as Thunder drive along the Sky: Then stooping in their Flight, at first they seize The Stately Fabricks and the Lofty Trees, To shew they're sent by an impartial Fate, Unbyass'd with regards of Pow'r or State. Thence lower falling, on the Cots they prey The Garners, and the Reeks of Corn and Hay, Mov'd from their Basis some, some blown entire away. Nor did it's Fury only Revel there, But Strip't the Roofs, and laid whole Cities bare: The Women Shriek't, agast their Husbands stood, Above a Hurricane; below a Flood. No Neighbour to his next Relief cou'd give, And for the Time, 'twas worse than Death to live. Tiles, Chimnies, Windows, Clatter'ing to the Ground Th'Unmortic'd Timber Crashing all around, Did all together make a more than dreadful Sound! Nor Great, nor Sacred wou'd their Fury spare, Nor Royal Houses,—nor the House of Pray'er; Well might his Wrath be on our Dwellings shown, Who then, wou'd not with-hold it from his Own. Thus five long Hours the Winds resistless rag'd, And War with all opposing Bodies wag'd. The Mountains nodded with th'amazing Force, The Sea recoil'd, and Rivers turn'd their Course. Nature her self did tremble at the Blast, And fancy'd ev'ry Breath wou'd be her last; She wou'd have fled, (but where cou'd she retire?) And had forgot she was to end in Fire. In the mean time the Bishop's Ancient Pile, Depending on her Strength, at all their Rage did smile: A thousand Blasts she had already born, A thousand more design'd to make her Scorn; Nor vainly did She on her self rely, Deep her Foundation, as her Walls were high. Thus, Careless and unmov'd she kept her Form, Just in the Whirl and Channel of the Storm. At last, as Heroes, that some Foe espy Repress their Trembling Troops, with furious Eye And Blood inflam'd, they loud for Combat call, Resolv'd at one Effort, to Conquer, or to Fall: Alike incens'd, the Winds their Rage pursu'd; And (Griev'd that yet the Sacred Fabrick stood) They all their Strength into one Blast Collect, And straight the tott'ring Palace found the dire effect: Down from their Lofty height the Tuns they threw, Which falling on the Roof, and forcing thro' With thundring Noise, soon made their horrid Way Where the Good Prelate, and his Confort, lay; So that, with not a Breathing Space betwixt; This Instant it was Life; and Death the next; Beat thro' the Floor, into their Hall they fell, Cover'd with Ruins of a Cittadel! Happy, O North of Britain! 'twas for Thee To 'scape from this Prodigious Tempest free: Tho' it with us was just like Egypt here, You had almost a sort of Goshen there: Ah! take the Mercy as by Heav'n 'twas meant, Confess your Sins, and seriously Repent; Who knows but, else, some more revenging Doom May shortly from your faithless Neighbours come, And bring You Fire, and Devastation home: Too much, alas! we their Revolt may doubt, More to be fear'd within, than France without. But by this time the bright Æthereal Form That had in Charge the Manage of the Storm, Perceiving what was done, with Horror shook, As thinking this an uncommission'd Stroke; So Sounded to the Winds a swift Retreat, For this Offence commanded back by Fate: A Fate that many Myriads might Reprieve, Which, but for their Remove had ceas'd to live; Reversing, thus, the Doom that Sampson brav'd There Thousands Perish'd, here were Thousands sav'd. The Morning came; but never rose the Sun On such a Spacious Scene of Mischief done: The Raging Sea with Wrecks all cover'd o'er And floating Bodies driving to the Shore: Helms, Rudders, Masts, among 'em mingl'd rowl, Now sunk as low as Hell, now lifted to the Pole: For yet the Waves retain'd their horrid Form And, tho' the Winds were laid, were in themselves a Storm. Some when the Storm was loudest met their Doom, Unheard, Unseen, and blest their Watry Tomb, Nor nothing fear'd so horrid in the State to come. Others, that weather'd out the dreadful Night, Were left to the worse Fate of Rising Light; Which, when Return'd, but only let 'em see Their Leaky Ships, and certain Destiny: The Land they had in ken; but all in vain They ply'd their Pumps, the Holds the more contain; And emptying of the Ship was emptying of the Main: Till, at the last, all hope of Safety gone, They Pray, Repine, Repent, Blaspheme, and Moan; Then, Sinking down, with Yells they rend the Sky, And Echo to the Shore the dreadful Cry. Nor on the Land was yet the Prospect less Of Loss, Amazement, Ruin and Distress! Here Groves of Trees, there Mighty Buildings cast; The Growth and Toil of Ages level'd at a Blast. Nor this the worst, but almost ev'ry where The Maim'd and Dying shock the trembling Ear; Like Job's Misfortunes the sad Tydings rowl'd, Another Ent'ring e'er the last was told. But of all Objects, his whose Loss we mourn Was the most sad and grievous to be born! The bare Relation all our Strength controuls, And sends a shudder'ing Horror to our Souls! His Flesh, his Blood, his Marrow, Brains and Bones, Dispers'd, and mixt with Timber, Lime and Stones! No likeness of what late he bore was found, But all thro'-out one undistinguish'd Wound! 'Tis true the Rigour something to excuse, His Ladies Corps her Fate did gentlier use, And left almost entire without a Bruise: Beneath a Heap of Rubbish bury'd deep, She in her Bed did just that Posture keep, As left, when she address'd her self to sleep. And yet alas! what Comfort thence arrives? What Kindness? since she now no longer lives! Nor Pray'ers, nor Tears her Being can restore! She's gone! for ever gone! and he can be no more! But if so sad to hear, what must it be To those that did their mangle'd Bodies see! What strange Amazement must their Kindred show! How can we guess their Grief, or speak their Wo, At such a Dismal and Relentless Blow! What Pencil can find Colours to express The fierce Extremes of filial Tenderness? Convulsions, Swooning, Raving to the last Excess! I feel methinks, the Anguish which they bore! I see 'em melt! and bleed at ev'ry Pore! Their Nerves Relax! the Stiff'ning Hair does rise! And a Strange Something, greater than Surprize, Shoots in their Hearts! and dizzies in their Eyes! How, gene'rous Margetts, cou'd you look upon Your Sister's Fate, and not invoke your own! How cou'd you think on the lamented Dame! How see her Dead; and not become the same! So chearful, aud so well but yesterday! So like to bless us with a longer stay! And now a Gastly! cold! extended Lump of Clay; You thought You came a Visit but to give, And 'twas to take Your Everlasting leave! 'Twas only Providence that cou'd impart Such Courage, to prevent thy Breaking Heart, That to the World You might their Worth Proclaim, Assert the Ways of GOD, and Vindicate their Fame. I see thee yet, methinks, the Pulpit grace Where He so well but lately fill'd a Place; Peace, in thy Mind; Composure, in thy Face: While all around the Audie'nce list'ning sat, To hear thee enter on this Theme of Fate. In what Soft Words did, first, thy Sorrows flow! Melting thy self, and melting others, too, Till all thy Sighs were lost in theirs below; How did thy Learning Soar! thy Langu'age charm! The Reason fix! and Elocution warm! Clearing to all the Will of Providence, As far as cou'd be reach'd by Human Sense: While all the time, (Intent on what you said) So Strange a Hush thro' the Cathedral Spread, The Living seem'd as silent as the Dead: Nor can the Sceptick hope the least Excuse, If what he heard he fails to put in Use. Last, with what Mildness did you tax his Foes! And Christian-like Unchristian Men expose! And all thro'-out so full! so Strong! so clear! Those that with Prejudice design'd to hear, Return'd convinc'd, that yet came Atheists there. Well from your Audience might you find esteem From such a Sacred, such a Noble Theme: For never was the Crosier known before In any British Hand, to merit more. What e'er he read (so ample was his Breast) His Memo'ry bore, and Judgment did digest. Nor cou'd you to that Oracle repair With any darkest Sense the Text does bear, But you might find a just Solution there. His Learning Copious, and his Reas'ning strong, And Truth it self sat charm'd upon his Tongue. Unweary'd in his Searches and his Toyl, He drain'd the Rabbins to enrich our Isle; And from the Treasures of his Sacred Store Advanc'd a thousand Lights that never shone before. By Demonstration He a SAVIOUR shews, Confirms the Christians, and Confounds the Jews; Whose Lives we soon shou'd to our Doctrin Frame, Were we the same in Fact we are in Name. His Teaching was Instructive Strong and Plain; Not roving here and there with Notions vain, Like some, who, following ev'ry Random thought, Preach wild and Rambling, just as Pindar wrote; Imposing on their Flocks a Gallick Treat, Whole Loads of Garnish, and but Scraps of Meat. All florid Langu'age, and a run of Words, No Musick to a knowing Ear affords; Expanded so, the Theme is beat to Death, And ev'ry Period cracks the Readers Breath. He, better knowing always did express His Notions in an easy, natural Dress: Truth is a Naked Beauty, but so clean Her Heav'nly Shape, and Lovely in her Mein She's Injur'd if she's not entirely seen. In Pearl and Gold she'd be but meanly shown, Adorn'd with brighter Glories of her own. His Precepts, thus our Reverence did command, With which his Practice travell'd Hand in Hand. His Life, thro'-out, one constant Bent pursu'd, All like his Masters spent in doing Good. With bleeding Bowels he beheld the Poor, And to 'em yearly gave one Third of all his Store; One Third in Hospitable Uses went, And lastly, One he sav'd—to pay his Children Rent. Happy the Poor! and happier were the Great! If ev'ry one wou'd, by an equal Rate, Give, spend, and spare;—his Rule of using an Estate: But contrary the Givers are but few And they that don't revile the Good that do. Shou'd GOD an Angel down from Glory send, That nothing but our Glory shou'd intend, He cou'd not make the Envious Man his Friend, And chiefly those that wou'd be understood, Tho' doing Evil, but pursuing Good. Thus some this Gene'rous Man a Niggard call, Because, like K?, he wou'd not part with all; Or, with old M? the Bumpkin Gentry Dine, And run on Tick some Hundreds deep for Wine. Not that I blame the Man who much does give, For 'tis our Duty where we much receive: But nothing but a Person Moap'd or Mad, Wou'd throw to thankless Rascals all he had: To other Families such Bounty shown, Is just the ready Way to starve our own. These two Extremes were well by Kidder seen, Good Natur'd Errors!—but He steer'd between; And neither Liv'd too Little, or too Great, But kept a Board proportion'd to his State; Disposing Things by such a just Address, 'Twas always Plenty;—but without Excess. Others Reproach him more that he Receiv'd The Sacred Robe while the Ejected liv'd: From whatsoever Mouths that Blast is sent, They're, first, no Friends at all to Government. That British Prince lives only in a Dream, And is but mock'd with Titles of Supream, Who lets the Man that won't Allegiance swear, In Church and State so high an Office bear. Who ever does the Regal Power offend, That Regal Pow'r may Legally Suspend: To make the Law speak any other Sense, Is, at the Bottom, to accuse the Prince. If Lawful then for Monarchs 'tis to give, 'Tis e'en as just for Subjects to receive. But who? Ah! who beside was ever known That willingly wou'd lay a Mitre down? If K? at William's Death had chang'd his Mind, The Saint deceas'd had thankfully Resign'd, If then this offer'd, and if that Refus'd, To Men and Angels Kidder stands excus'd. But while his Foes did thus their Venom spit, His Sacred Office well he did acquit, And never one Ordain'd but what was truely sit. Strictly he to the Canon did adhere; Not to be mov'd by Friendship, Pow'r, or Prayer: 'Twas hence bad Men his Conduct did despise, Hating that Worth which wou'd not let 'em rise, But all in vain their Clamour, Noise and Art; The Consciousness of having done his Part He Treasur'd up for Comfort to his Heart. Sharply the Idle Shepherds he'd reprove; But do Your Duty and You had his Love. His Converse gentle, and his Temper free; But all was season'd with Humility. So easie of Access, he wou'd not send To know the Name, but Instantly attend. So much his Duties were his Constant Care, You'd think he liv'd on Piety and Prayer. In Self-Denials ev'ry Day he pass'd And even on that which did precede his last, He strictly kept his Private, Weekly Fast. So near his Death as but the Night before, His chiefest Talk was Cloathing Fourscore Poor, Nor did one Word in Contradiction fall; Only to do it Privately was all. Thus to the last a Holy Mind he bore; Untir'd with all his Charities before, He dy'd in the Resolve of doing more. This was the Pattern;—and his Lady hence Imbib'd her Meekness, Truth and Innocence. Daily she for the Needy, Garments made, And ply'd, as 'twere, the Busi'ness of a Trade: And taking from a more Abundant Store, She pass'd the famous Instance heretofore; And was the British Dorcas of the Poor. So much did Charity, her Thoughts Sublime, Giving and Lending took up half her Time: But tho' so ready ev'ry Want to aid She never lent with Thoughts of being Paid; Or if some Honest Minds return'd the Loan, She made it then, a Second time, their Own. But most she Joy'd in what our SAVIOUR bid, To do a Benefit and keep it hid: This was a Point she dearly lov'd to gain; For 'tis not Christian Bounty when 'tis vain. Nor die she to her Lord for Money go; (For his she knew was always using so) Out of her set Allowance this was done, That she might call the Charity her own. In Prayer, Contrition, and a Private Fast, Two Days in ev'ry Week she always pass'd, To mortify, and fit her for her Last: But this so secretly, 'twas often done Ev'n to her very Lord himself unknown; The Notice only to her Children came, That they might do, in after Times, the same. In all Relations she so far excell'd, No future Age will see her Parallell'd! A Loving, Faithful, and Obedient Side, In Wedlock near, in Vertue nearer ty'd; Her Husband's smiles her Joy, and his Content her Pride. A Sister so affectionately dear, You'd think she plac'd her whole Indulgence there, And had for other Uses none to spare. Yet was the Aunt so Tender always shown, As ev'ry Nephew were an only Son. So fast a Friend! that to be first approv'd, (For Vertue only Her Affection mov'd,) Was, next, to be Eternally belov'd. So good a Neighbour! none remain'd in Grief Where either Cost, or Care, cou'd bring Relief. Then for a Mistress, (tho' the most admire The Servants skill'd in Fashion and Attire,) She to her Favour ne'er did one prefer, But only such as “dress'd themselves in Her: Chast as the Thoughts that from Devotion rise, Wafted on Wings of Angels thro' the Skies: And cou'd we what her Notions are presume, She there exults she met her Husband's Doom, Sent with so good a Christian to the Tomb! Whose Life thro' half a Century of years At once she Copy'd, and Reliev'd of Cares! Till fit at last with him to Wing the Air, They went to Heav'n as in Elijah's Car, Rap't in a Storm to be the Sooner there: Where round their Brows Eternal Lawrels grow, And at there Feet Eternal Pleasures flow; The just Reward of Living well below! And now ye Impious Sons of Belial come, And censure, if You dare, their sudden Doom: Cou'd Souls like theirs, thro' a long Age approv'd To God and Man, in Vengeance be remov'd? Cou'd all their Vertues no more Pity have But to be sent in Anger to the Grave? A sudden Fate may be indeed severe To Wicked Souls, but 'twas a Blessing here: What e'er Uncharitable Men presume, That Death which calls the Vertuous Liver Home Is best when it does Unexpected come; And does the Mind from all those Terrors free Which, oft, we in the best of Christians see, At Lanching off into Eternity. Ah! happy Accident! this Moment here! The next in Heav'n, and crown'd Triumphant there! By Ling'ering Sickness most are worn away, Or trembling Age, and die a Grain a Day: Their happy Souls are up to Glory gone Without a Sigh, or least departing Groan: One both in Life and Death, they went entire; And by their very Fall ascending high'er, Were Lodg'd at one Rebound in the Æthereal Quire: Where, far advanc'd above the Starry Sphere, He now enjoys the Endless Honour there Of his Asserting the Messiah here. Hail then! for ever Hail! ye holy Pair! And if in the immortal Regions there You know your Enemies Conjectures here, Pity their Frailties, and their Spite excuse, Who bred to Slander, natu'rally abuse: A little Time, perhaps, may force their Tears, And let 'em see your Loss prevented theirs; While by a Mind enlightn'd to Fore-see Which way t'atone our angry Destiny, (Like Curtius dying for the publick Peace) You fell your Selves to make Destruction cease. Less Love of Old was by the Patriarch shown, Whose Stay perhaps, had sav'd the cursed Town: Just contrary was here the Fate they shar'd, For Lot was torn away!—and Sodom spar'd. But whither strays the Muse? who void of Care, Bewails the Dead, but has forgot the Fair? Forgive me Madam, to your Charms untrue, Thus long to keep your Image out of view: The Thoughts of Horror, Death, and Fate unkind, Remov'd that Lovely Object from my Mind. I meant to Mourn, and with Excess of Grief, To join with yours, all hopeless of Relief! With Raving, Anguish, and a burst of Tears, I thought to rive all Hearts, and wound the dullest Ears! But by their happy Exit, shown before, All just Occasion for our Sighs is o'er; And, gazing upon YOU, we now can Mourn no more! Whose Charms inevitable Love displays! Whose Wit is shown a thousand various Ways! Whose Worth does merit Everlasting Praise! Whose Eyes, like Cæsar, all Opposers Doom, And with a Glance but Look, and Overcome! I wou'd go on!—but O the blaze of Light, Flashing around with Rays so fiercely Bright, Suppresses and Confounds my feeble Sight! Nor can the Muse avoid the like Extreme, But sinks beneath th'abundance of her Theme. Funeral Eclogues. Urania, a Funeral Eclogue. To the Memory of Mrs. Wharton. Damon. Alexis. DAMON. Alexis, why that Cloud upon your Brow? Has Beaute'ous Chloris lately broke her Vow, And the sad Tydings reach'd your Ears but now? It must be so—that must be, sure, the Cause Which from Your Eyes this Bleeding Deluge draws. ALEXIS. Were it no more than a frail Nymph unkind, It rather shou'd divert, than wound my Mind; For he that grieves when such their Love estrange, As well may grieve because the Wind will change. No, Damon, no; my Sorrows fetch their Spring From a more sad, a more Important Thing. Were all my Life to be one Mourning Day, Or cou'd my Heart dissolve in Tears away, 'Twere yet a Tribute for our Loss too small; Our Loss I call it, for it wounds us all. DAMON. Still to your Tears you call a fresh Supply, And still conceal the sad Occasion why. ALEXIS. Can it be possible you shou'd not know The Fatal Cause that has unmann'd me so, When Sorrow does such dismal Sounds diffuse, And ev'ry Nymph and Swain's expiring with the News? These beat their Breasts, and t'other rend their Hair, Like Lovers that are wedded to Despair, Shrieking as if the last tremendous Doom, The Dreadful Change of Time and Place were come. DAMON. No longer in Suspence then let me stay; No Grief can wound me more than this Delay. ALEXIS. Take then, O Damon! take the worst in Brief, The worst! for not the Gods can give Relief. Urania! sweet Urania! justly fam'd, And never but with Admiration Nam'd; Adorn'd with ev'ry Vertue, ev'ry Grace, These in her Mind, and t'other in her Face: Urania! in whose Temper we might find All we believe of the Celestial Kind: God in his Works she early did Rehearse With Heav'nly Ardour, and harmonious Verse; Her Verse! that makes it Disputable yet Which most cou'd Charm, her Beauty or her Wit. Ev'n She!—O Damon! You may guess the rest.— DAMON. Is Dead? ALEXIS. And with her all our Joys deceas'd Nor Dies she single:—back the Blood retires, The Eye can nothing see it more admires, Hope's at an End, and Love it self expires! DAMON. O killing Sentence! which I die to know! Or dost thou try me, and but feign thy Woe? Ah! undeceive me quickly, if 'tis so.— But see! thy Eyes run o'er! in them I view The fatal News y'ave told me is too true! ALEXIS. Too true indeed!—when I my Thoughts advance, Reflecting on the Turns of Fate and Chance; What various Accidents disturb our Rest, All level'd at the Beaut'eous and the Best, Subject to ev'ry Wrong, and worn with Care, (Of which, Urania! thou hast had thy Share;) How swift by an unpitying partial Doom They're snatch'd from hence, and hurry'd to the Tomb; Leaving the Wicked and the Vain to wast, And glut on Blessings they cou'd never taste; I hardly can the impious Thought forbear, That Heav'n sits unconcern'd at all that passes here. What Favour does the Fair and Chast attend But black'ning Tongues, or an untimely end, A fatal Consort or a treach'rous Friend? Thus in the Bloom of Youth her Verdure fades O Brightness cast into perpetual Shades! Mean while th'Adulterer's Frolick pleas'd and Gay, And circulating Comforts Crown the Day, Successively they each their Part dispence; And this unequal Dealing's Providence! DAMON. Alexis, do not blame Divine Decree, And the strict Laws of strong Necessity; For since Eternal Justice cannot err, What that Inflicts we shou'd with Patience bear. 'Tis not for Souls unglorify'd to pry Into Incomprehensibility: Ev'n Reason fails us; 'tis to Faith alone The Secret Paths of Providence are shown: The seeming Inconsistencies it joyns, Brings to one Centre all the different Lines, And shews us all is Good that Heav'n designs. But were this Argument not half so strong, You know, Alexis, all must die e'er long. ALEXIS. True, Damon, but not all must Die so young. As for the Aged let 'em pass away, And drop into their Tenements of Clay, The Doom is just; they've had what Life can give And wou'd be Burthen'd longer to receive. But she, you know, like a Meridian Sun, Had all her Sweetness, all her Lustre on; A Glorious Light, tho' not arriv'd at Noon! Ah Vertue! why allow'd no longer Date? Ah! Treach'rous Hope! and Ah! Relentless Fate! DAMON. What Reason is there to Indulge your Grief When 'tis but just to try, and have Relief? Think her (as sure she is) among the blest, And has begun the Sabbath of her Rest; Think her releas'd from all that World of Woe Under whose Weight she Labour'd here below; And you will find to more Account 'twill turn To bless her Change, than thus Immoderately to Mourn. Repine not then, Alexis; 'tis not well;— Yet, since y'are on the Subject, prithee tell By what sad Fate the Sweet Urania fell. ALEXIS. A Mortal, but a Lingering Disease Upon the Spirits of her Life did seize; Her Strength decreas'd, and ev'ry Fatal Day Still took a part, till all was born away. Pale, Wan and Meagre did her Cheeks appear, Tho' once a Spring of Roses flourish't there. Thus long she lay, with Strong Convulsions torn, Which yet were with a Saint-like Patience born; Till Nature ceasing, rather forc't to cease, Gave her a Painful, yet a kind Release. Go, sacred Nymph, ascend the Spangl'd Sphere, For it has wanted long thy Lustre there. Faithful and Loving to the last she prov'd; And better did deserve to be belov'd. Here Colon I cou'd— DAMON. Mention not his Name, But let your Subject be the Matchless Dame. ALEXIS. So many are her Vertues, and so vast, And crowd upon my Memory so fast, 'Tis hard to fix on which I shall begin; As 'twill be hard to leave, when once I'm in. Her Language was from all that Dross refin'd That floats in the Converse of Womankind: So distant all her Conduct from Offence, 'Twou'd still begin, and end in Innocence. Her Ardour for Celestial Things did show She learn't to be an Angel here below. Our SAVIOUR's Precept is to pray for those That are our Mortal and Inveterate Foes; Hard Lesson! hard to us, so prone to Err; But 'twas a very easie One to HER. So fixt to Truth, and fervent in her Prayer, As if she only breath'd Ætherial Air. The Poor no other Merit need pretend; Affliction made her still the faster Friend. Nor was her Charity to Sides confin'd, But flew where e'er she Worth, or Wit cou'd find, As much disdaining Limits as her Mind. If e'er her Words to an Invective ran, 'Twas to th'Ungiving, Thankless, Prosper'ous Man, Who much Receiving, yet from none wou'd part, But view'd the Poor without a Yerning Heart. So close with Chastity her Mind was wrought, That all her Life knew not a Blemish'd Thought: And as she there did her own Sex excell, So she as much did Ours in Writing well: Her tuneful Numbers pleas'd the Nicest Ear, And the most Haughty Swains were Proud to hear. Whether her Song with Friendship's Pow'r is fraught, Or to her Private Inju'ries turn her Thought; Whether with Love she our Affection wins, Or Paint a SAVIOUR Suffering for our Sins, She's all a Wonder!—like her Soul, serene! Like Venus, Lovely! and like Dian', clean! Ah Sweet Urania! of all Womankind Where hast thou left one like thy self behind— Unless the Chast Mirana? who but She? Thy Vertuous Sister! for in HER we see, Thou dear departed Saint, how much w'ave lost in THEE! DAMON. Thou hast, Alexis, so Divinely shown The Vertues of the Nymph for whom you moan, In such sad Numbers told what Grief supplies This deep Dejection, and these flowing Eyes; That I, ev'n I (tho' what I wou'd not do) Have caught thy Frailty, and am melting too. ALEXIS. That pious Grief Heav'n cannot but forgive Which makes the Vertu'ous in our Memories live.— But see! if now thy Tears so freely fall, There goes a Sight that will engross 'em all! The Sweet Urania (Ah too rigid Doom!) By Virgins born to her Eternal Home! See with what mournful Pomp the Scene appears, The Swains all Speechless, and the Nymphs all Tears. Instead of Flow'ry Wreaths, with Chaplets crown'd Their Temples are with Funeral-Cypress bound, In vain their Silence; for their Looks impart, A lasting Anguish, and a Bleeding Heart! Ha! Damon! see! on the sad Bier display'd, Where all the Riches of the Earth is laid! You sigh! But Ah! you know you sigh in vain; You'll never more behold her tread the Plain! No more you'll hear that soft harmonious Voice, Which none yet ever heard but did rejoyce! For ever ceas'd are all her Matchless Lays! Heav'n has clos'd up the Volume of her Days! O Grief! that thus I yet repeat her Name, Can say, She's dead! and not become the same! DAMON. Cease, dear Alexis, lest it shou'd be said We fail'd in our last Office to the Dead: It cannot add to our Affliction more To see her laid in Dust—the worst alas is o'er! Nor shall our scatter'd Flocks be yet our Care, This more Important Duty calls us there, With Dazies, Pinks and Daffodils and all That Flora yields to Celebrate her Fall, And Crown the Herse of the Departed Fair, That, Living, was the Crown of Vertue here: Profuse of Sweets, we not a Flower will save, But empty all the Spring upon her Grave. Alcander, a Funeral Eclogue: To the Memory of Sir Gilbert Gerrard, Bar. whose Death was occasion'd by the overturning a Coach. INTRODUCTION. The Sun was set; and the Retiring Light With feeble Beams repell'd approaching Night: When poor Amyntor, with his Head reclin'd, A pensive Visage and a troubl'd Mind, (His Flock not Folded) to the Grove retir'd; Alone, nor any Company desir'd. True Mourners still the Dark Recesses crave, Most pleas'd with those that are most like the Grave Doran, who all the Day had mark'd his Grief, And fill'd with Hope to give him some Relief, Follow'd the weeping Swain; who thus bespoke Him Ent'ring, sighing as his Heart were broke. Doran. Amintor. AMYNTOR. Doran, methinks this lonely gloomy Shade Seems only for Despair and Sorrow made: The Cheerful Sun darts here no rosie Beam, But all is sad and silent in extreme; The Melancholy Place deserves a Melancholy Theme. DORAN. Look thro' Blue Glass and the whole Prospect's blue; Thro' Sorrow's Optick this Retreat you view, And that does give it the same Tincture too. You first saw Cælia in this very Place; Cælia! the Chastest of the Charming Race, All Truth writ in her Mind, all Beauty in her Face! Not one of all the Shepherds on the Plain That sigh'd for the fair Maid, but sigh'd in vain; She still frown'd on, regardless of their Pain: You only gain'd her Favour, and 'twas here The sweet disdainful Nymph vouchsaf'd an Ear: She heard you, so much Wit and Truth were shown, You melted her to Love, and made her all your own: And still as Lovingly these Myrtles twine, As if her snowy Hands lay prest in Thine, And all the Quire of Birds stood mute to hear her Voice Divine. 'Tis you then that are chang'd; and O! if what My boding Fears suggest I may relate, In your Desponding Looks I read Alcander's Fate. AMYNTOR. You have it right, it is too truly so! He's gone, where (soon, or late) we all must go! He's gone, whom we for ever shall deplore! Alcander! dear Alcander is no more! No more! O bitter and afflictive Sound! What two-edg'd Sword can give a deeper Wound? What Ponyard, Poison, or envenom'd Dart Can find a quicker Passage to the Heart? They wound but once, and this thro' ev'ry Pore: No more! O bitter, hateful Word, no more! DORAN. Thy Grief, O Friend! with the like Grief I view; For to the Vertu'ous still a Tear is due, As well from those unknown, as those they knew. How many down to low Oblivion roll, Life Name and Memo'ry, and there Perish whole? Others there are (and yet of those but few) At most Remember'd but by One or Two, A Wife, a Husband, or a Gaping Heir That inward Smiles, and Strains to force a Tear. None but a Soul for Publick Good design'd, Diffusive, Brave, Impartial, Wise and Kind, Cou'd leave so many mourning Friends behind. AMYNTOR. If we his Vertues in our Sorrows shew, There shall be nothing wanting Grief can do To make 'em lasting, and to draw 'em true: Of all the Myriads back to Dust return'd, Not one e'er more was miss'd, or more was mourn'd! In me, O Doran! read (and You may see His Loss in no small Measure touches me) How all the Swains (as if their Souls were one) Disdain to think of Respit to their Moan; With Eyes o'er flowing, and a Bust of Grief, They Sigh! they Swoon! they Rave! and fly Relief! DORAN. 'Tis hard, Amyntor, and has made of late Some Wretched Men Expostulate with Fate; 'Tis hard, and it must pierce the Hardest Heart To think that Honour, Beauty and Desert, Are most obnoxious to the Fatal Dart. AMYNTOR. Too many sad Examples we may view, That what Y'ave said, O Doran, is too true! For O! to my Confusion now I find Death makes Distinction, takes the Just and Kind, And nought but Knave and Coxcomb leaves behind; And they live on the Time that Nature gave, Till, tir'd with Life, no longer Time they crave, And upon Crutches creep into the Grave. But such as dear Alcander at a Day, And oft unwarn'd, in Health are snatch'd away! Why had not I his Fatal Hour supply'd! For Him to Live, how willing had I dy'd! No Loss by me cou'd on the Publick fall, His Loss does for the Publick Sorrow call, And will, as soon as heard, be mourn'd by all. His Country's Glory he did still attend, That with his Life and Fortune to defend; No Man was ever more his Country's Friend. But he is gone! he's gone! and let us mourn! Gone to the Grave! and never must return! To the dark Grave! to the wide gloomy Shade! Where, undistinguish'd, Good and Bad are laid! O Eyes! run o'er, and take of Grief your fill, Let ev'ry Tear be sharp enough to kill! Let ev'ry Groan come from my Heart, and show 'Tis torn with the Convulsive Pangs of Woe! O Cheeks! henceforth no Sanguin Colour come To open View, but Pale usurp the Room; Such a true Pale as may distinctly show The fatal Cause from whence the sad Effect does flow! Let from my Lips the livid Tincture fly, Like Ev'ning Rays before a gloomy Sky; And a dark Ashy Hue thro'out be spread, Dusk'd over like the Visage of the Dead!— In vain alas! I'd thus my Sorrows shew! 'Tis all, that Nature and that Art can do, Short of our Loss, and wanting to my Woe! DORAN. When I just now Your Sorrow did Commend, I did not mean a Sorrow without end: The Dead claim Nothing but our Present Grief, While Nature does exert her Pow'r in Chief; For they that dye well give us this Relief: They're free from ev'ry Vice, and ev'ry Care, Envy, Disgrace, Resentment, and Despair, With all the Num'rous Catalogue of Ills That plague us here, and crowd the Weekly Bills. In spite of all that's urg'd in Life's defence, And all the Pleasures that depend on Sense, There's no true Pleasure till we go from hence. Beside it from the depth of Folly springs, Our striving to prevent inevitable things. Not all our Sighs and Tears, tho' ne'er so great, Tho' spent at never so profuse a Rate, Can change th'unalterable Doom of Fate: We must resign when Heav'n does give the Call; Cedars, where that does lay the Ax, must fall. AMYNTOR. That all must Die is true beyond Debate; But some may Die too soon and some too late. When good Men leave us (what e'er turn you use) Tho' Heav'n may gain, we wretched Mortals lose: There brightest Spirits but small Lustre add, Here they shine out, and wou'd direct the Bad: Like Israel's GUIDE in a Corporeal Shrowd, By Night our Pillar, and by Day our Cloud. How many cou'd we at this Instant name That strive to put the Nation in a Flame, Blood their Delight, and civil Strife their Aim? For needy Men with Rage their want supplies, And in a common Ruin soonest rise: In any Change that's for subverting all, 'Tis they will be advanc'd that cannot fall. He wisely saw which way the Stream wou'd force, And ras'd the Banks that did divert it's Course. O never let the Swains his Praise forget! But make his Vertues lasting, as they're Great. Nor shou'd we doubt the fixing his Esteem, Cou'd but our Strains be equal to the Theme. DORAN. He was your Friend, I oft have heard you tell Scarce new-made Mothers love their Babes so well. Your richest Incense to his Memory bring, You best that knew his Worth and best his Worth can sing. AMYNTOR. My Oaten Reed no lofty Notes can raise, And lofty Notes alone can reach his Praise: Yet tho' I'm short in Pow'r accept the Will, And let my Love atone my want of Skill. DORAN. Be still ye Winds; let not the gentlest Breeze With winding Laby'rinth murmur thro' the Trees: Ev'n Philomel thy Charming Grief forbear; Y'ave long pleas'd us, now lend your self an Ear; Let all below, above, and all around us hear, While in loud Strains Amyntor gives to Fame A Life of Glory, and a Deathless Name. AMYNTOR. Y'ave heard, O Doran! of our fatal Broils, Our harrast Country and intestine Toils: How the Proud Subject, in a cursed Hour, Assum'd the sacred Reins of Soveraign Pow'r. By unjust Force a num'rous Host was rais'd, The Patriots of Rebellion lov'd and Prais'd: Enthusiasm, Interest, Spite and Rage, And all the Agents of a barba'rous Age, Broke loose at once, and level'd at the Crown, To raise themselves by pulling Justice down. 'Twas for our Sins (and a prodigious Birth) Th'Almighty pour'd his Vials on the Earth. May we no more to such Destruction live, Or, if we must, not from our selves receive. Here brave Alcander, on this bloody Stage, Found Work t'employ his Vertue and his Rage. And that his Loyalty might first be try'd, He took the Royal, and the suffering Side. In all Encounters prodigal of Blood, Nor valu'd Life lost in a Cause so Good: Where Danger and Confusion thickest lay, Thro', like a Storm, forc'd his impetuous Way. Let Edge-hill's fatal Field his Worth declare, Success in Conduct, and his Name in War: Nor only He, but, with the like Applause, His Father, Uncles, Brothers, all were in the Cause. O Loyal Family! O Ancient Name! The Sound repeated fills the blast of Fame! The Royal Martyr saw, and had regard, Saw his vast Worth, and gave him due Reward. But ah in vain!—Art, Courage, Conduct, Force, Were all too weak to stop the Torrents Course; Down fell the Banks, the Deluge enter'd fast, 'Till all was lost, all overwhelm'd at last! For 'twas permitted gracious Charles shou'd Bleed, To brand his Rebels with a blacker Deed Than Hell that did Inspire 'em cou'd Exceed! Thus Blood and Usurpation rais'd their Head; When with the rest the brave Alcander fled, And long in Exile mourn'd his murder'd Lord; Nor saw one happy Moment, till he saw his Race restor'd. Here was a short amends for all his Pain, A Fortune Ruin'd, and his Kindred Slain. Th'Auspicious Prince return'd, benign, August, Look't on his Wrongs, advanc't him into Trust; And never was a Subject trulier just. But who, alas! can long a Favourite be? Or ride safe in the Court's inconstant Sea? A Sea, indeed, where Winds but gently blow, But full of Shelves and treach'rous Sands below; Where when they'd to the Port of Safety Steer, It mocks the Statesman's Art, and Pilot's Care, And leaves th'adventu'rous Wit forlorn and bare: A tott'ring Station can no Peace afford, And Envy wounds much deeper than the Sword. DORAN. The Wisest and the Bravest ne'er cou'd be From the vile Tongues of black Detractors free; And rising Vertues, as they mount the Sky, They daily watch and murder as they fly. As the returning Light expels the Dark, And points the Archer to the distant Mark; So Good Men, made by their own Polish bright, Stand but a fairer Butt for Rage and Spite. A Prince's Favour dange'rous Glories bring; In ev'ry Male-content it puts a Sting: By such the Fav'ourite is despis'd, debas'd, The Good he does the Publick goes unprais'd, The more their Hatred, as He's higher rais'd. When thus the Legislative Crew prevail, And drive on furious, both with Tyde and Sail, The Worthy, Honest, Loyal Man must fail; Expos'd to black Aspersions, Publick hate, And oft Resigns to an Inglorious Fate. Of this hard Truth let wretched Strafford tell, He, who when all cry'd Justice! Justice! without Justice fell. AMYNTOR. Darkn'd a while, but not quite overcast, 'Twas but a faint Eclipse, and soon was past. Alcander's Vertue was too bright to lye Long shrouded under Odious Calumny; But, like the Sun, for a short time retir'd Behind a Cloud, broke out and was admir'd. And let me here to their Confusion tell, Their lasting shame that shou'd have us'd him well, (An Honour ne'er conferr'd but on the Brave) He bore his Prince's Favour to his Grave; Firm in his Grace he stood, and high Esteem: And here again renews the Mournful Theme! When Glory seem'd to court him with her Smiles, And give him Peace after an Age of Toils; When all around him 'twas Serene and Bright, And Promis'd a long run of Life and Light, Then! then his Eyes to close in Death's Eternal Night! And, which does yet for further Sorrow call, By a mean Accident Ignobly fall: Not in the Field where Fame and Honour's Sought, And where, with Blood, he had that Honour bought; Not in his Kings, or injur'd Country's Cause, Destroying those that wou'd Subvert the Laws: But by a Chance that does too truely show How little to that Trifle, Life we owe! Not worth one half we to preserve it pay, That is in spite of all our Care, so quickly snatch't away: Add to all this his firm unshaken Mind, To the fixt Pole of Glory still inclin'd: A Carriage Graceful, and a Wit Sublime, A Friendship not to be impair'd by Time: A Soul sedate, with no Misfortune mov'd, And no man was with more Misfortune prov'd. Death he ne'er fear'd in it's most Ghastly Form, In Slaughter, Blood, and Cities took by Storm: Now he Caress'd him with a Cheerful Brow, Welcome at all Times, but most welcome now! O had you heard, e'er he did Life resign, With how much Zeal he talk'd of Things Divine, You wou'd have thought, so sweet his dying Tongue, While he discours'd descending Angels sung; Waiting his Better Part with them to bear; Which now, let loose, thro' the vast Tract of Air Pierc't like a Sun-beam, to it's Native Sphere. DORAN. There let him Rest!—and let the Thought, my Friend, That he is Happy thy Complaints suspend,— But come, 'tis time we now shou'd Home-ward steer, And, to be plain, 'tis but cold Comfort here. The Mold is damp, the Wind perversely blows, And Night, far spent, invites us to Repose. Come, let me raise Thee by the Friendly Arm— What? still in Tears? and has my Voice no Charm? AMYNTOR. Yes, I will go, but think not of Repose; My Heart's too full to let my Eye-lids close. No cheerful Thought shall in my Breast find Room, But Death and Man's Inevitable Doom: Nor Rest will I invoke, unless it be, That Rest that shakes off dull Mortality. When, following Him that is past on before, I lay me down to sleep and wake no more. Mirana, a Funeral Eclogue: To the Memory of that Excellent Lady Eleonora, late Countess of Abingdon. Damon. Alexis. ALEXIS. Damon, the Spring is now in all her Bloom, And, like the Phœnix, mounts in her Perfume: If ought on Earth like Paradise can show, 'Tis at this Time a Paradise below. But ah! shou'd some malignant fatal Blast At once lay all her blooming Beauties wast; Now quite Disrob'd that was but now so Gay, As if December had succeeded May! Shou'd you so strange an Alteration see, Wou'd it not make as strange a Change in thee! DAMON. I know not well, unless that Change shou'd come; Which Heav'n avert!—'twould be a dreadful Doom. ALEXIS. 'Tis come! 'tis come—If any Earthly thing, Mirana was the Mirrour of the Spring; Chast as the Morn, soft as her smooth pac'd Hours, Clear as her Fountains, Beauteous as her Flow'rs, And Fruitful as her warm Prolifick Show'rs, Her Glories all were blown, and fresh as May, When one black Moment tore 'em all away! No Sickness did her Charming Fabrick seize, No Sign, no Fear, no Thought of a Disease; All calm, all hush'd in Midnight Rest we lay, Dreaming, alas! of a more Joyful Day: When, like a Storm, or sudden Trumpet's Blast, And dreadful too, as it had been the last, As swift, as loud the dismal Tydings spread, And did as much confound—she's dead! she's dead! With Horror struck, and stupid with Surprize, We scarce at first believ'd our Ears, or Eyes; Then wish'd Those cou'd not hear, nor These cou'd see; While all that saw her turn'd as Pale as SHE! O Darkn'd Light! O Day shut up too soon! 'Tis just as if the Sun shou'd set at Noon; Now Glorious, drest in all the Blaze of Light, And now, but wink, and all Eternal Night? Ah! why shou'd so much Sweetness Heav'n display, Just only to be seen, and snatch'd away! Why have the Vertuous still the shortest Stay? Yes, Cruel Pow'rs! a Sentence so severe, The Loss of one so Young, so Good, so Fair, So like your selves, her Nature so Divine! Wou'd justify us if we shou'd Repine. DAMON. Beware that Thought—and if you can allow Reason may lessen Grief, hear Reason now. 'Tis true, we own her Doom too soon was past, Her Fate was sudden, and her Loss is vast. But think (for sure you may remember well) Think how her Sister, dear Urania, fell, When ev'ry Arte'ry, Fibre, Nerve and Vein Were by Convulsions torn, and fill'd with Pain. We griev'd that there such Cruelty was shown; And shall we murmur because here was none? So quick and willing she resign'd her Breath, As if 'twere her Translation, not her Death! Not He who did the Firy Coach 'employ Went thro' an easier Passage to his Joy. A kindly Sleep did the keen Arrow hide In Ambuscade—and she but wak'd and dy'd The Pale-fac'd Tyrant did but half his Part, Not pierce, but gently touch'd her with his Dart; Enough, indeed, to take her from our Eyes, But then enough to mount her to the Skies. Nor yet did he intend an Envious Blow, But took her when at full prepar'd to go; Nor cou'd he take her otherwise than so: Her Life (so much she Labour'd to excell) Was one continu'd Course of doing well. Never before so much Uprightness shin'd From the strait Compass of a Female Mind. Ve'rtue's Columbus! she new Worlds explor'd, And, which was greater yet, the Old Restor'd. A Life so led must place her with the Blest; To grieve, then, is to Envy Her her Rest. ALEXIS. O you mistake!—but be mistaken still, All Men will mourn where Worth can Grief instill; And because she was Good must we be Ill? Who now feels not true Sorrow pierce his Mind Has not the smallest Touch of Human Kind. Talk not of putting Passion out to School, To weep by Reason, and to mourn by Rule. For such a Loss 'tis Cruel to be Wise, Not to have breaking Hearts, and flowing Eyes, Not to be drest in all the Pomp of Grief, And all without a Thought, too, of Relief. I'll draw the Scene, and, as You are a Man, Refrain your Self from Weeping—if you can. 'Tis done.—Now see Her that was late so Fair, Joy to the Eye, and Musick to the Ear! An Angels Voice with Magick tun'd her Tongue, And when she mov'd, she carry'd Paradise along! There! see her stretch'd amidst a weeping Crowd, Still as the Grave, and paler than her Shroud! Observe what a dark ashy Semblance lies Upon her, lately, Life-reviving Eyes! Think on those Lights for ever clos'd and set, Where so much Mildness, so much Brightness met! See there! where Beauty did in Pomp remain, With all the Shining Graces in her Train, Eternal Silence, Fate and Horror reign! DAMON. Is this, Alexis, this the Heav'nly Fair? Alas! how diffe'rent Life and Death appear! I shrink, methinks, and inwardly can see What a much more affrighting Figure I shall quickly be! ALEXIS. View next her sad Attendants all around, With Ruful Looks, and fastn'd to the Ground. Ah? never, never with her Image part! But fix the dear Remembrance at the Heart! For search the Globe, and You no more must find So sweet a Temper, and so free a Mind; Of the Deserving, Proud; and to th'Offending kind. See there her Hero's Brother; tho' so stout, This killing Object works his Weakness out: But well the Name of Weakness 'twill not bear; He's now no Man that does refuse a Tear. See here her Uncle of her Ancient Race, His Mind's Confusion writ upon his Face! He came by Chance a Visit but to pay, He found her Healthy, and she prest his Stay, Thoughtless the next wou'd prove her fatal Day. Not the least Grief did then affect his Heart, Tho' now, alas! he bears so large a Part. See there Carnarvon's Beaute'ous Countess stand, She who can all Things, but her Tears, command: Observe how Nature does in her Contend Which most to mourn, the Sister, or the Friend. Pale are those Cheeks that cou'd such Sweetness boast, And her Bright Eyes have half their Lustre lost. DAMON. I saw, my Friend, I saw before You spoke Her Tears o'erflowing as her Heart were broke; While to the Partial Powr's she seem'd to say, Good a Life might claim a longer Stay. ALEXIS. View next Three Daughters and Six Noble Sons In whom the Blood of dear Mirana runs; Look how the Mother has fill'd ev'ry Eye, Tho' some so Young, they weep and know not why. And here, Methinks, we may too plainly see The hard, and rash Resolve of Destiny. Their Minds, just molded, the Impression took, Truth from her Soul, and Sweetness from her Look, When in one Moment she was from 'em torn, That Living Precept! whom we all must mourn. Where can they now the like Example find? At least, the like among the Beaute'ous Kind? Who can, like Her, a Constant System be Of Prudence, Meekness, Love and Purity? Who now can raise their Souls to fit the Frame That was design'd 'em by the Noble Dame? Or cloath 'em round with Vertue for their Guard, And make that easie which we make so hard? Weep all you Tuneful Nine with one Consent, And just as when Urania dy'd Lament. And you her Children as your Tale's the same, With equal Sorrows give her down to Fame. What juster Cause can for our Tears be known Than Honour, Grace, Renown and Sweetness gone? Think what the Pale-fac'd Tyrant has engrost, And what your selves, and what the World has lost? Mirtillo, you are old enough to know; Inform the Younger as they riper grow, That with their Knowledge still their Tears may flow! DAMON. The fair Melissa, Friend, you do not mind, (Mirtillo's Consort) sighing from behind: There! wrapt in Sables, see the Mourner lies, With all her Soul transfus'd into her Eyes! ALEXIS. Sorrow indeed, does play the Tyrant there.— But see! ah see a sadder Object here! How like the Dead the Living does appear! See how her Lord in silent Anguish stands, With Eyes erected and uplifted Hands! He knows not what to say, or think, or do, Confounded with the unexpected Blow! Hardn'd in Woe, and loathing all Relief, He seems himself the Statue of his Grief. Ah! why with so much Violence inclin'd For present Sorrow?—he'll hereafter find Too much, when her Endearments all appear Fresh to his Mind, and fix her Image there: For tho' remov'd from our Corpo'real Sight, He'll see her by an intellectual Light, Not barr'd by Distance, and not veil'd by Night. Each Day will to his sad Remembrance bring The dear Reflection of some dute'ous thing. The Noblest, yet the Humblest of her Kind! The finest Form! and the most finish'd Mind! A Cabinet fill'd with the Richest Charms That ever Husband lock'd within his Arms? So Tender, so Obedient all her Life, As if his Guardian Angel, not his Wife. So Chearful, Chast, and Studious of his Ease, So truly kind, and so resolv'd to Please, She gave him (as his Fate were in her Pow'r) In nineteen Years not one afflictive Hour. Design and Strife were Strangers to her Heart, But Peace and Truth and That were ne'er apart. Anger might knock, but he no entrance found: He durst not tread that Path, 'twas Holy Ground. Her Temper was to Piety so true, Not her whole Life one rapid Motion knew, Like a smooth Stream it did unmurm'uring roll, Clear as her Eyes, and even as her Soul! But see! her Hero can refrain no more, His Heart is bursting, and his Eyes run o'er! In vain he does let fall that plente'ous Show'r, No Rain cou'd e'er revive a faded Flow'r! Can you behold all this and Weep not too?— DAMON. No more Reproof—alas! my Friend, I do! Nature is Pow'rful; to her Law I bow, Tho' Contradicting what I said but now. ALEXIS. 'Tis as it shou'd be—they who truly grieve, Ne'er stand to ask their second Thoughts the leave: True Grief, without Controul, will reign alone, And seizing on the Fort, makes all her own. But we'll retire, and next observe the Poor And Naked, that in Numbers crowd the Door. These long she Cloath'd, and those as long has fed; She griev'd to see a Man that wanted Bread. Ill was his Chance, tho' distant, that cou'd be Remov'd from her diffusive Charity. Where e'er she came, like Nile, she'd Plenty bring, The Stream Conspicuous, but unknown the Spring. Look how they grieve each other to behold, And, tho' 'tis Summer, shake to think of Winter's cold. See on that Hand the Sick despairing lie; Now she is gone, they must the sooner Die, Their speediest, surest, cheapest Remedy. What help the Art of Physick cou'd afford They had unask'd, and many she restor'd. No wretched Creature who his Health had lost Need, to regain it, spare the smallest Cost: Nay when she fear'd her Judgment wou'd not do (And much she strove to know, and much she knew) Then she wou'd pay for the Physician's too. Observe how they Expostulate with Fate, That did not grant her Life a longer Date. In sparing HER, ye Cruel Pow'rs! (they cry) Y'ad kept us fearless of Mortality: Now we must Languish, Pine, and drop away, For who so Rich will care the Poor shou'd stay? The JEWISH DORCAS was recall'd by Prayer, Why is that Method ineffectual here? She was as Good, and we as much her Care: But ah! we do not tread th'Apostles Path; She had the Vertue, but we want the Faith. O Wond'rous! O Exemplar Soul! if e'er True Innocence did in thy Sex appear; If ever we cou'd yet Perfection see, We have the nearest View of it in THEE!— But least malicious Men shou'd Disbelieve, And think we Flatter, or but vainly grieve, Hear Friend, my sacred Imprecation hear, And let both of us kneel, and both be bare. Doom me (ye Pow'rs) to Misery, Strifes and Shame, Let mine be the most ignominious Name; Let me each Day be with new Griefs perplext, Curst in this Life, nor happy in the next, If I believe she has her LIKE survives; Or if I think her not the best of Mothers and of Wives. DAMON. Thy wish shall have the Suffrage of us all.— But hark!—'tis so, our Bleating Charge does call: Close, close the mournful Scene, and let the Curtain fall. Damon, a Funeral Eclogue: On the much Lamented Hen. Bayntun, Esq; Strephon, Menalcas. STREPHON. We have not for Mirana dry'd our Eyes, When Damon's Fate does give us fresh surprize; E'er we cou'd rise from that amazing Blow W'are struck anew, and laid again as low! MENALCAS. I thought w'ad not one Tear yet left to fall, I thought that Angel had Exhausted all: When see! again they stream from ev'ry Eye! Nor less than such a Sea of Grief cou'd such a Loss supply! STREPHON. He was, Menalcas, all he here cou'd be, Th'abstracted Goodness of Humanity: Of vast Processions, and an Ancient Line, His Mind Capacious, and his Form Divine. But what does Beauty, Birth, or Pow'r avail When Fate does the weak Fort of Life assail? Snatch'd from our Hopes ere half his Race was run! Ah Early Good! and ah too Early gone! Why are the Hero's Matchless in Desert The first that must from all their Comforts part? Or are we truely what old Plautus calls Us miserable Mortals? Tennis Balls, Which Fate in sport, without regarding Who, Does strike away, and still, profusely, call for new: Cruel! for thus the Wise, the Good, the Brave, Are not distinguish't from the vilest Slave, One Common Chance attends 'em all, and one Promiscu'ous Grave. Of Kindness Nature molded half his Heart, Of Wit, and Brav'ry form'd the other part. Favour from most we can but Partial call; He with extended Arms embrac'd us all. Scarce Heav'n it self more Liberal of it's Store; To know him was to be no longer Poor. Had but the Muse a Voice to reach his Fame, Such Worth shou'd never want a Deathless Name. MENALCAS. Who cou'd believe, when favour'd with a Son, Who thought when the Boys Race of Life begun, His Noble Sire's was so nigh being run? A Prospect then of op'ning Joys were seen, All Great and Bright, with not a Cloud between; But while we gaz'd and did their Glory prize, Heav'n shut the Scene for ever from our Eyes! O dark Eclipse! O Worth for ever fled! The Living Beggar'd to enrich the Dead! STREPHON. Curst be the Tongue that, with a pois'nous blast, His bright unclouded Fame wou'd overcast: Now w'are in Mourning; but the Muse e'er long Shall change her Stile, and think upon his Wrong; Revenge her Noble Patron's injur'd Fame, And fix (who e'er 'tis) on the hated Name As true an Ignominious lasting Brand, As red-hot Iron on a Villains, Hand: And all too small for th'opprobious Slave, That lets his Malice reach beyond the Grave. MENALCAS. Let 'em alone, let 'em their Fictions frame, They reach not Damon's ever-honour'd Name: The Publick Voice does know 'tis Private spite, And Envy, Friend, was never in the Right. —But tell me, how does Adorissa fare? How does that Beauty her Affliction bear Now she is lanch't into this Sea of Care? Her Grief, methinks, no Reason shou'd controul; He was her Joy, her Life,—he was her very Soul! STREPHON. When on his Bed the dying Swain did lye, As full of Love, so full of Piety, She wringing of her Hands and weeping by. The World (he cry'd) the World I can despise, With all its trifling Joys and Gawdy Vanities, But Ah! from Thee Thus to be torn away!— Grief stopt him here, he cou'd no further say, For only, only SHE was worth his Stay; The doubly bitter thought from HER to part Deeper than Death did pierce his Labou'ring Heart. All Wit, all Beauty, and all Truth her own; To be to her in that Relation known, It hardly is more Heav'n where he is gone. But Lo! the Hour is come, his Breath's requir'd, He gaz'd on her and, with a Sigh, expir'd. What here cou'd the Divine Afflicted do? What Pow'r oppose against the Cruel Blow? Swooning, she fell into her Womens Arms, And in a Moment lost a Thousand Charms. Her Warmth, her Colour, Senses, all were fled, And, of the Two, she seem'd the Real Dead: And dead we thought her, not a Sign was shown, Nothing to tell but that her Soul was flown. But who that's Sick, can at a Wish, have Ease? Or can the Wretched die what Hour they please. Reviv'd, her bright, her All-Commanding Eyes She cast up, half in Anger, to the Skies; Accus'd the Pow'rs that gave her Double Woe, To take him hence, and not his Consort too. Ah Charming Adorissa! spare that Breath, Thou more than Angel talk not yet of Death! Think on the Double Pledge he left behind, The more Despair presides, the more to them unkind: Like You, the Daughter; and like Him, the Son; Ah! who will teach 'em after you are gone, So well the Follies of the Age to shun? Who can so truly point the Boy the Race His Noble Father did to Glory trace, And press him swifter onwards in the shining Chase? And then your own Example is so bright, Your other Comfort will have all the Light Vertue can give, to guide her Goings right. O Live! fam'd like thy Father's Mother's be, In Worth, in Honours Eminent as She, In Age, Maternal Care, and Piety— But mourn!—Ah! mourn his Loss yet many Years, Spare but the Life, be lavish of thy Tears! MENALCAS. Amid'st our Grief we may this Comfort find, H' has left, in Minature, another self behind: And, to speak justly, we have ne'r before Seen one so very Young that promis'd more. STREPHON. Admire the Boy, (the Boy, too, I admire) But not forget the Vertues of the Sire. No, Damon, if I banish THEE my Mind, Be Life Improspe'rous, and be Heav'n unkind— —But hark! the Winds are loud, without Controul They Rave, as if they meant to shake the Pole: The Skies all with one dismal Noise resound, In Sables hid, and hung with Horror round. By this Tempestuous Night is well exprest The Tumult and Confusion of my Breast; The Passions all in Arms to rob me of my Rest. And then, perhaps, the coming Dawn may see The feather'd Quire assume their Harmony, The Heav'n's disburthen'd, and a Glorious Morn All Vernal Gay, as Nature just were born. But ah! the Rising Light will bring us on No Objects, but of Damon dead and gone! With Grief that in no Bounds we shall contain, A Ruin'd House, and an Impoverish'd Plain! How much in Him did late his Country boast? How much in Him has his dear Country lost? Lost an Impartial Lover of her Laws, The Church and King a Champion in their Cause. Honour, her Guide; and Honesty the Prop That strongliest kept her fainting Credit up: And O! the Muse that does his Worth commend, Has lost, at once, her Judge, her Theme, her Patron and her Friend! MENALCAS. 'Tis late—Rest to the Wretched gives Relief; To her Embraces Sacrifice your Grief: In her soft Arms the Soul no Anguish meets, For the tir'd Mind drinks deepest of her Sweets. STREPHON. Think not, Menalcas, sleep will ease our Care, But rather make our Loss the heavier bear. While in her Charge the Clay does fast remain, Th'Immortal Part, not shackl'd in her Chain, Will bring him to our Visionary View, And make us, Nightly, mourn him o'er anew?— But let us go; least taking Time too large, We be not up against Alexis knocks: That Swain, you know, is Early with his Charge: We may, at once, both weep and tend our Flocks. Nicander and Thirsis; a Funeral Eclogue: To the Memory of Sir James Long Bar?. and Sir Robert Long Bar?. his Grandson, who dy'd about three Days after. Palamon. Lycon. Amyntas. LYCON. Change, change these Strains into the Voice of Moan! Or know you not Nicander's Dead and gone? All Eyes are Flowing, ev'ry Heart does Bleed, And thou art tuning of an Oaten Reed. PALAMON. Age must make way when Destiny does call; If Fruit is Ripe, who grieves to see it fall? How can Nicander's Fate require our Tears, Who dy'd, as full of Honours, full of Years? If to his Name you wou'd a Trophy raise, Let it not be with Sorrow, but with Praise. Those that untimely drop our Pity crave; But he was old, and mellow'd for the Grave. LYCON. Had Palamon but known his Worth like me, His Sighs had come as thick, his Tears as free. Yet (if our Grief can be so long supprest) We'll not deny so Gene'rous a Request: And when you see in his long Race of Fame, How still the Prize of Vertue was his Aim, You'll Praise that Grief which now you seem to blame. PALAMON. I blame it not, but wou'd excuse my own; Yet spare thine now, and make the Hero known. LYCON. Sprung from an Ancient Stock, and noble too, More Glory there he leaves, than thence he drew: The Name whole Harvests has of Honours bore, And he has added largely to the Store. Who e'er degene'rates from a Noble Race, With his own Hand asserts his own Disgrace: He scorn'd to come behind their bravest Deeds; No Spur an In-born Emulation needs. None did in Danger further Dare than He; The Blossom shew'd the Fruit, the Fruit the Tree. The Liberal Sciences he early gain'd, With Ardour sought, and with Delight retain'd. His Form so Lovely, we but one cou'd find That did exceed it of the beauteous Kind, The Charming Portia! after to him given, To let him have below Taft of Heav'n. Thus, with Applause, he past his younger Age; Then came the Civil War to whet his Rage. Born for his Country's Good, his Loyal Soul (Which Fate cou'd not depress, or Force controul) Espous'd the Side that had the least Success, And but for him it might have, oft, been less. His Courage was in num'rous Conflicts try'd, His Sword as oft in Rebel's Blood was dy'd. At last Confusion overspread the Land, In vain did these Obey, or those Command: Religion, Royalty, and Law o'erthrown, Successful Villany made all its own: Nor left a Prospect Comfort to afford, But Peace Exil'd, no more to be Restor'd, A Bleeding Country, and a Murder'd Lord! 'Twas here the Greatness of his Soul was seen By all that plac'd not Prejudice between; Above his Pow'r he buoy'd the sinking State; But ah! what Atlas cou'd support the Weight? And here 'twas, too, his beaute'ous Consort's Care (When Sequestrators meant to strip him bare) VVas his Estates Preserving and Repair. Her Love, her Wisdom, Wit, we learn from hence, She sav'd it then, and has encreas'd it since; O ample Proof of Female Innocence! From Vertue such as this we might Presage More Guiltless Times, and a more Happy Age: And Lo it came?—Auspicious Charles Return'd, From whom the Royalists, despis'd and scorn'd, So much had suffer'd, and so long had mourn'd. And as none than Nicander griev'd before So much, so no Man then cou'd Triumph more; Or their Allegiance and Expence Employ In Nobler Scenes of Grandeur, Love and Joy. His Active Age thus past among the Great; His last and feebler Years were all Retreat: Unless his Country (which his Worth admir'd) In Senate his Advice, or Aid requir'd. The Rural Life and Innocence he lov'd, And a whole Age had their Contentment prov'd. Plenty and Joy he spread thro' all the Plains, Pleas'd were the Nymphs, and happy were the Swains! PALAMON. And happy HE that, nurs'd in War and Strife, So well cou'd taste the Peaceful, Unambitious Life. LYCON. The Name of Peace, O Friend, his Office bore, And none e'er Labour'd to preserve it more. Beneath his Dignity He'd stoop to be Th'Occasion those at Variance might agree: Nay further yet, wou'd with his Money part To pull the Core out from th'Infected Heart. Thus Foes he'd with Superiour Kindness awe, And in the Yoak of Friendship make 'em draw, To keep 'em from the Harpies of the Law: Those Harpies, Lycon (fatal to our Rest) That all our Country Villages infest; That worse than Wolves, of late, have round us prowl'd; Those for a Sheep, but These are for the Fold. By them of our old Haunts w'are oft depriv'd, Tho' the long Claim is from the Gods deriv'd. Neighbour with Neighbour setting at Offence, With more than with a Devil's Diligence. PALAMON. Blinded with Spite, how vain a thing is Man? Like Flies, how busie in his own Trepan? They see a Blaze, and plunge into the Flame; And Law's to the Litigious Slave the same. LYCON. Nor this the worst; in Corporations too They've Footing took,—but all their Footing Rue: So Pole-cats in a Warren beat about, And, once got in, Root all the Natives out. Not an ELECTION in the Burrough's made, (Whatever other Bills may be delay'd) Without th'Attorney's being trebly paid: Jobbing their Votes, he for few Guineas buys; But who he sells to, must to Hundreds rise. No matter what his Groaning Country bears, So he can fill his Purse, and keep his Ears. 'Tis carrying on his own, and Brethrens Cause To choose a Race that may confound the Laws: For soon such Legislators plainly show, 'Tis to be brib'd above, they bribe below. Thus Villains now become the Common Name; Th'Electors and th'Elected all the same. Forgive me, Friend, the Sting's Improper here; But when a Sett of Rascals lie so bare, Who that may have a Hearty Lash wou'd spare? PALAMON. Cou'd thy Resentments but Nicander hear, He wou'd attend 'em with a List'ning Ear: A fix'd Abhorrence to 'em all he bore, Nor cou'd th'acutest Satyr Lance 'em more. LYCON. Whene'er, with Others, he in Sessions sate In Service of his Country, or the State, He scorn'd the Scale shou'd any way decline Either for Fear, for Favour, or Design: Thus careful to avoid the least Extreme, You'd think Astræa's Hand had pois'd the Beam. In Earth, O Goddess! You cou'd ne'er Delight, To Heav'n with Him Y'ave took your second Flight: Wretched of Old You left the Sons of Men, And w'are almost as wretched left as then: Nicander did thy perfect Image bear; He did thy Loss, but who must his Repair!— Here, Friend, the Rancour of our Nature scan, For Envy spares not this Prodigious Man; But thro' false Opticks Spots pretends to find In the Seraphick Brightness of his Mind: (To gaze on so much Lustre made 'em blind.) Happy! thrice happy for themselves 'twou'd be, If those that blame him were from Blame as free. Who ever liv'd that 'scap'd an envious Tongue? There's no such thing as Privilege from Wrong. Shou'd Angels stoop to bear us Company, Angels themselves wou'd not be Censure-free. Yet still his base Traducer he forgave, Which ever happn'd to be Fool or Knave. PALAMON. A Villain's Praises, or a Sot's Applause, Is an Effect that does degrade the Cause; To have from Men so vile an evil Name Proclaims w'are injur'd, and asserts our Fame. LYCON. So famous for his Justice, tho' he be, He has no less Renown for Charity. With what he gave, he did so freely part, Swift was his Hand, but lagg'd behind his Heart. Nor did he drive the Ostentatious way, Like those that give for Praise,—that is, for Pay; The Gift not known, they think the Alms is lost; But HE that taught to give forbid to boast. No, to the Secret Path he had Regard, And Heav'n did give him openly Reward: The Liberal Hand of that he daily felt, And th'Overplus as Liberaly he dealt; Mindful of Want, as if in Want h' had dwelt. Large his Possessions, larger was his Mind, Just like his Bounty, which was unconfin'd. His Gate still open, and his Table free; His noble Spirit cou'd not brook to be Out done in Love, or Hospitality. When the warm Season did our Nobles bring To taste, or Bath in Bladud's wond'rous Spring; Who of our Rural Leaders cou'd we see So Obsequious, Courtly, or Elate as He? Or when the Royal Families resort, For the same Reason, made that Place their Court; Who at their Coming and Return again, So constantly did wait 'em thro' the Plain, With a more Loyal Heart, and such a num'rous Train? PALAMON. O Lycon! such a publick Soul as this In it's Retirements must be of a Piece! His private Hours how did the Hero pass? Men are best seen in that more faithful Glass. The Heart in Publick Views we darkly find, 'Tis Converse gives the Image of the Mind. LYCON. 'Tis true my Friend;—but when we wou'd relate The Charms that happy Converse did create, W'are lost in multiplicity of Ways, A Spring of Vertues, and a Maze of Praise! If of Religion he Discours'd, we thought, (So pleasing 'twas to hear) an Angel taught: More might be learn't from him in one short Day Than in whole Years from some that Cant for Pay. If he but spoke of History, you wou'd find All the past Ages present in his Mind: His faithful Memory gave his Tongue the Cue, To Season that his Wit was always New. When e'er in Counsel he employ'd his Thoughts, He was Achitophel without the Fau'ts. If on the Sciences his Speech did fall, You'd think he Understood, and Practis'd all. Philosophy's Experimental part He Study'd with much Labour, Cost and Art: In Animals and Vegetables too, He found the Deity at ev'ry View. To a sharp Eye that can with Judgment look Thro' the nice Foldings of wise Nature's Book, GOD's no less seen in things minutely small Than in his spacious Work, the mighty All. Full was his Sense, and his Expression clear, Food to the Mind, and Rapture to the Ear! Bright his Ideas, and sublime his Thought; So Moral, he spoke just as Plutarch wrote. His Language had of Youth the Force and Flower, Nor had his great Age made his Temper sour. But ceas'd, ah! ceas'd is that harmonious Tongue On which Mankind with such Attention hung! Long we enjoy'd it e'er 'twas snatch'd away, But ah! his Night is longer than his Day! The Grave when once the Lamp of Life's withdrawn, Admits no Morrow, no returning Dawn! A heavy Gloominess that Light invades, Dark! dark Oblivion! and eternal Shades! And this not all; the Wicked and the Just, Hero and Slave, are level'd in the Dust. Tho' we repine not, yet we may presume Such Worth deserv'd not that promiscuous Doom. PALAMON. A Great and Noble Life y'ave Travell'd o'er, And justly you such Excellence deplore: May his Example in young Thirsis raise Like Ardor to be such a Theme for Praise.— —But look Amyntas swiftly hither hies, And nearer see, your Grief has touch't his Eyes. What News my Friend: AMYNTAS. Confusion! Death! Despair! Horror on Horror, more than Man can bear! O Dismal Chance! and O Relentless Fate! Why must such Goodness have so short a Date! PALAMON. So short a Date? Who is it drains these Tears? Does he die Young that has seen Fourscore Years? Why dost thou grieve at so profuse a Rate? And think that Early, which, indeed, is Late? AMYNTAS. O you mistake! Nicander's Loss I know, And with a Bleeding Heart have mourn'd it too. 'Tis Thirsis, Friends, 'tis Thirsis I deplore;— But think the rest, for Grief will let me say no more! LYCON. Y'ave said too much, not to go further on, And vainly You wou'd hide what must be known: Speak then, tho' it prove Mortal to my Sense; 'Tis worse than Death to live in this Suspence. AMYNTAS. Then die!—for Thirsis you no more must see, A sudden Blast has shook him from the Tree! The fierce Disease that whets Death's keenest Knife, The Mortal Foe of Beauty and of Life, That of the Fairest Fruit will ever taste, At once, has laid his Blooming Glories waste! Ah Brittle! Ah too finely twisted Thread! Too bright a Jewel to be set in Lead! Too sweet a Form to mingle with the Dead! Nicander gone, in all our Height of Grief The Thoughts of Thirsis gave us some Relief. Where must we now for Consolation go? Or when have Cessation for our Woe? No Glimpse of Comfort must we hope to see Till we are in the Grave, and cold as He! PALAMON. In vain we watch, and Vertue make our Guard, The Stroke of Death what Hero e'er cou'd ward? Unseen, or sudden, he attacks the Fort, And where he aims is never wide or short. Ah Lovely Youth! and art thou too expir'd! Whose Company both Gods and Men desir'd! Thy Soul so soon else had not been requir'd! Ha! Lycon! have these Tydings struck thee Dumb? LYCON. No, were I Marble now my Tears wou'd come! Witness ye Pow'rs! we to your selves appeal; Is this the Justice You to Mortals deal? Is this the Way the wounded Heart You heal? Say that Nicander dy'd by a Decree Impartially Impos'd by Destiny, The Fate of Thirsis yet was Cruelty! He that in Honours might have flourish'd long, Snatch'd from our Hopes, all Beautiful and Young, When none that ever liv'd did promise more, Or sooner such a Crop of Vertues bore!— Ah! think Amyntas, if of Grief our Share Does weigh so much, how Portia her's does bear! Can all her Patience such a Shock sustain! Will not her Eyes gush down a Show'r of Rain Enough to drown this Fabrick once again! What can she do, what can she think, or say, Now Root and Branch are torn at once away! AMYNTAS. Like those for whom no hopes of Life remain, That dying Lie, yet say they feel no Pain; Sorrow has seiz'd so fully on her Heart, And pierc'd so deep, she's Ignor'ant of the Smart: Her Spirits with her Loss are sunk so low, That she's benumb'd and stupify'd with Woe. Full fifty Years of her foregoing Life Nicander show'd the World the happiest Wife: And then that Husband's Fate but just to know, When Thirsis dead! was added to the Blow! Thirsis! the lovely, witty, bold and gay, Thirsis! her Age's Comfort, Hope and Stay! Hard Hearts! that can for them their Tears defer, And harder yet that cannot pity Her! PALAMON. Yet such there are—but while they theirs deny, Our Duty 'tis that Comfort to apply. My Grief once o'er I will my Counsel give; And O I wish that Counsel she'd receive. She then shou'd daily less'ning be her Cares, And fix her Hopes on the remaining Heirs: She shou'd consider Heav'n is absolute, Whose Will, perhaps, 'tis impious to dispute: Why shou'd we grieve for those remov'd away, When none can be so happy by their Stay? Who knows but Fate, by this, may let her see More clear the Frailty of Mortality? And make her Ardour, which was great before, To climb the starry Region still be more? Where they're but enter'd first to make her room, And fix her Seat against she's wing'd to come. —But see! the distant Sun yet lower gets, And they will be interr'd before he sets. Dry then your Eyes; there we shall weep again; Let us reserve a fresh Supply till then. LYCON. The Sheep are yet to fold. AMYNTAS. And let 'em stay, Guardless at Night as Keeperless to Day: Nay 'twill be well, now Fate has robb'd the Plain Of all the Worth and Wit that did remain, If ever we return to 'em again; That growing wild, they may for ever stray, And we, with Grief, turn yet more wild than they! The Mourning Swain, a Funeral Eclogue. Humbly offer'd to the Memory of the Right Honourable James Earl of Abingdon; And Dedicated to his Grace the Duke of Leeds. The Sun almost an annual Race has ran Since the Decease of this Prodigious Man So long ago (and such the Nation gave) These faithful Tears were wept upon his Grave. They who can see when Nature sways in Chief, Will find 'em shed in an extreme of Grief: Without her Aid, in vain we strive by Art To limn a weeping Eye, and bleeding Heart. In private writ; in private to the Plains I thought to have confin'd these Rural Strains, An Ev'ning Concert for the mourning Swains; When on their Oaten Reeds his Name they'd raise, All tun'd to their departed Patron's Praise. But call'd from thence in publick to appear, (My Self by being Worthless fenc'd from Fear) I fly to YOU with this Illustrious Name, To stand between Detraction and his Fame. With Merit Envy ever did commence, And Vice is still suppressing Excellence; Like feeble Eyes that shun the Glaring Light, 'Twou'd cover what it cannot bear in Night. Your nearness to the HERO in his Blood, And the yet nearer Tye of being Good; Your joynt Endeavours, and your joynt Success In lab'ring for your Countries Happiness; Your mutual Friendship, with such Concord knit, That Love ne'er made so dear an Union yet; All these Regards make this Address your Due: It can, my Lord, belong to none but YOU, The Honour of this celebrated Name; Return'd, in some Degree, from whence it came, Guide of his Life, and Guardian of his Fame. Justly these Lines may Safety seek, where late 'Twas found by an affrighted tott'ring State: When to the Verge of Anarchy it drew, Hurried along, and all her Fears in View, She, Sighing cast her Eyes for Aid on YOU; You who so oft (when wander'd from the Way, And lost in Night) have led us to the Day. Loud was the Storm; and now advancing nigh, There seem'd no Hope of Help from Policy. Here Bigottry, like Scylla threat'ning stood, Horrid with Wrecks, and painted o'er with Blood. There like Charybdis, Tyranny appear'd, Fearful to Sight, and hideous to be heard! And yet between 'em lay the happy Coast Which either we must make, or all be lost. Here 'twas (and greatlier ne'er employ'd before) Your Counsels did our Peace and Pow'r restore, When they had took their Leave to come no more. Where does the wond'rous Penetration lie? Or is all Nature open to your Eye? That thus YOU forward look among the Fates, And seem a second Providence to States? For ever on the Publick Good Intent, YOU Foreign Ills divert, and Home prevent. No more an empty Title to the Main Our Squadrons boast; by your Advice they reign. Europe and Africa Triumphant saw Our Navy ride, and give the Ocean Law; While those who thought t'invade us now retire, And leave their Shores to Spoil and Hostile Fire. If the Physician oft divert our Fate, By feeling how the Blood does Circulate, What may HE do that knows the Pulse of State? Be Fever, Faintness, Frenzy the Disease, Or if a Lethargy the Vitals seize; Be it Luxurious Peace, or Lawless Might, Or Legislative Rage for Ravish'd Right; Be it a less'ning Fame, or less'ning Trade, The Neighb'ring Strength increas'd, or Ours decay'd, The Remedy is certain YOU advise; And we are ne'er so Low but then we Rise. And yet in Spite of this unweary'd Care, Among us there a sort of Monsters are, Whose Tongues, like Jews, wou'd not their Saviour Spare: But y'are secure, and all their Malice vain; Such Vertue is too Rich a Dye to Stain. As when a Nymph breaths on a Crystal Glass, The Damps a while obscure her Beaute'ous Face; A Dimness on the fair Reflection lies, And sits between her Image and her Eyes: But soon the Self-assisted Mirror's clear, The Envious Shades dissolve into the Air, And all her former lovely Lineaments appear. So what e'er Spite with black'ning Breath can say, The Lustre of your Worth does purge away, Breaks thro' the sullen Gloom, and settles Day. But while (alas!) the too advent'rous Muse Ambitiously her noble Flight pursues, She finds the Weight above her Pow'r to raise, And sinks beneath the Pressure of your Praise. A Life like yours a History does claim, An ample Fabrick that may hold your Fame; Where on immortal Pillars shou'd be grav'd The Princes y'ave oblig'd, and Kingdoms sav'd. And Lo! (for what can veil the Muses Eyes?) I see, methinks, a fam'd Historian rise, Impartial, Great, Elab'rate, Learn'd and Wise! One on whose Works the Graces all shall Smile; So just a Subject claims the justest Stile. No other but the best of Pens shou'd show The future Ages what the Present owe To LEEDS, and (O too early from us torn;) That other Godlike Man whose loss we mourn: Your Glory will not less Illustrious shine, To have his Name immortal made with Thine. He shall to the succeeding Times display How you both stood, when hopeless of the Day, Rescuing the Rights Deserters did betray; The Slaves that for precarious Pow'r and Place, To French Designs wou'd stoop the British Race, Born to be FREE; and not to be o'ercome, Unless by Pension'd Sn?ts sold at Home. The Mourning Swain, a Funeral Eclogue: On the much Lamented Death of the Right Honourable James Earl of Abingdon. Menalcas, Damon, Alexis. MENALCAS. He sinks! he dies away!—Alexis! Friend! 'Tis thy Menalcas calls!—some God descend, And save the Swain from an untimely End. Ha! he grows Paler still!—O Damon! you Are come, as you Prophetically knew The Aid I wish'd, and what his Griefs wou'd do! DAMON. I heard the broken Sobs, and fault'ring Breath, And Groans like those the Wretched give in Death. What sad Occasion— MENALCAS. Ask not yet our Grief, But lend the swooning Shepherd quick Relief: Chafe, chafe his Temples; forward gently bow The Body—this, or nothing else will do: Tho' when his Spirits to their Seat return, He lives to Grief, and but revives to mourn! DAMON. What unforeseen and sudden Stroke of Fate Is this, that Nature sinks beneath the Weight? That Life, retiring, shuns th'unequal Fight, And if it conquers must o'ercome by Flight. MENALCAS. The worst that cou'd the wretched Youth attend: Bertudor's Dead! his Master, Patron, Friend! Bertudor! than which yet a worthier Name Was ne'er took up, or sounded off by Fame. I brought him Word the Noble Soul was flown, And fear the Fatal News has wing'd his own. Is this to be your Image? Cruel Pow'rs! How are we Yours, when withering Grass and Flow'rs, Vapours and Bubbles, are so truly Ours?— —But see! the Blood does to his Cheeks ascend, And Labouring Life returns—How fares my Mourning Friend? ALEXIS. Again! do I yet draw this hated Breath? And, flying Life, can be but mock'd with Death? Will not the Partial Pow'rs that rule above Permit this last, best, dearest Act of Love, To die! and by that Test our Sorrows prove? Must we be doom'd in Being to remain, Renew'd to Grief, and but preserv'd for Pain? Ah! dear Menalcas! what an Ease 'twou'd be Cou'd we at Will shake off Mortality! Cou'd with our Tears our Lives dissolving fall, And Grief had long Oblivion at her Call? But 'twill not be!—in worst Extremes, as now, The Soul wou'd rest in Death, and swoons to go, When strugling Nature gives us back to Woe! MENALCAS. The Fatal Loss, Alexis, all will rue, Heavy to us, but heavier yet to you: You were acquainted with the Hero young, He knew you early, and he lov'd you long. ALEXIS. He found me helpless, and of Friends bereft, Of Parents, and the Little they had left. The World look'd frowning on my Early Years, And I seem'd destin'd by my Stars to Cares. He took me, rais'd me, fix'd me in his Sight, By Precept and Example kept me Right;— But ah! the Lamp is gone, and I am hid in Night! He taught me Good, then gave that Good regard; But still, it still was short of the Reward. With the new Day new Favours he'd impart, Then make the World believe 'twas my Desert. And shall? O shall this BENEFACTOR go, And we not sing his Worth, and sigh our Woe? The last sad Task that Gratitude can do! Shall Time or Rage be suffer'd to efface The Mem'ory of this best of British Race? Shall Fame amid'st such Merit silent lie? Shall e'er the Springs that water Grief be dry? No! no! while Vertue does on Earth remain, And Flocks and Herds feed on th'Oxonian Plain; While Learning there and Piety increase, And Truth can rest in the soft Arms of Peace; While there is Wealth employ'd to Gene'rous Ends, While there are Sweets in Love, and Faith in Friends, So long the Muses shall his Loss deplore, That rain'd a Golden Show'r on them, and Manna to the Poor. DAMON. How various are the Ways of Providence! How crooked oft they seem to Human Sense! He's gone! for whom there's not a Soul but Grieves, And yet his Foe, the Treach'rous Jockney lives: He Lives! (nor does degenerate from his Breed) That never did one honourable Deed: Yet lives in Prosp'rous Fortune, high in Trust, But barba'rous to Desert, and plung'd in Lust: He lives! that yet ne'er did a Loan restore, E'er pay a Debt, or e'er relieve the Poor: He lives! that wou'd subvert the Church and State, And ride 'em, loaded with Despotick Weight: He lives! that nothing Impious e'er did shun; He lives! a longer Race of Vice to run; He lives! and yet the good Bertudor's gone! MENALCAS. If Vertue meet with a so early Fate, Can Vice presume to hope a longer Date? If Tempe'rance thus at Noon is snatch'd away, Can wild Excess expect to End the Day? ALEXIS. It does! it does! and ev'ry Wish succeeds, On Down it lies, and on Ambrosia feeds; No inward Pang it feels, or future Reck'ning dreads. The best, alas! are summon'd first to go, Have least Success, and least Regard below. The Haughty mount, and on the Humble tread, Depress 'em Living, and Revile 'em Dead: Their Honours, won with Blood, are from 'em torn, And by their Mortal Foes insulting worn. No Disappointments e'er th'Unjust attend, The Just have hardly GOD or Man their Friend. Hence Providence is oft misunderstood, Scoff'd by bad Men, and doubted by the Good; While undistinguish'd Right and Wrong are hurl'd, And Knave and Fool between 'em share the World. MENALCAS. 'Tis not for Man, with a too daring Eye, To look into the Secrets of the Sky; Or if he shou'd, in vain he strives to see Thro' the Dark-woven Folds of Destiny. As the Meridian Sun, all flaming bright, Gaz'd on, confounds, and quenches human Sight; So Reason fails, and sinks beneath the Weight Of Will, Omniscience, Providence and Fate: From the high Beach 'twou'd look the Ocean o'er, But there's no Reaching to the distant Shore: Abstruse, Immense, and barring all Access, The further we go on, the more 'tis Wilderness! But thou, Great Soul, disburthen'd of thy Freight, Art Landed on that other Side of Fate; To Thee those Distributions now are clear, That so perplex, and so confound us here. 'Tis true, thus much by Reason's understood; Affliction is the Test that tries the Good: Where'er it visits 'tis by Heav'n's Command; Not Shuffl'd out, as Vice wou'd understand, With blinking Eyes, and a Promiscu'ous Hand. If Prosp'rous Fortunes are to most a Snare, Why not th'Afflicted God's peculiar Care? Expos'd to black'ning Tongues, and faithless Friends, Only to ply their Souls for Nobler Ends; For Regions where w'are known, and know aright, Where Day is never to resign to Night, And flying Time no more can bound Delight. Shou'd Pleasure here run smooth with equal Feet, And a long Life no Disappointments meet; Shou'd the first Honours be by Worth possest, Humility advanc'd, and Pride deprest; Shou'd Hope succeed and Root out ever'y Care, Our Friends all Faithful, and all Chast the Fair; What e'er Hereafter more were to be giv'n, We here shou'd fix, and seek no other Heav'n. But since this never was, nor will be so, Not Revelation scarce can plainer show That Vertue's not to wear her Crown below. This Contemplation shou'd Your Griefs remove; Our very Suffe'rings a Reward does prove, It must not be on Earth—and it must be Above. ALEXIS. Of this, Menalcas, I am conscious too, But what avails it to divert our Woe? Bertudor, tho' to endless Glory gone, Has left us Cause for a whole Age's Moan. When Great Elijah did on high ascend, And Heav'n's bright Chariot his Ascent attend, What Joy was it to his Remaining Friend? He, in His Loss, deplor'd his Country's Fate, Their Civil Strifes, and Cruel Hazael's Hate; Nor yet is Ours a fix'd unmurmu'ring State. When will Delive'rance from Oppression come, If such as HE are call'd so Early Home? When will our Publick Fears and Private Hate Be at an end, and lose such Props of State? Who, when the Royal Cause is sunk so low, Will set so vast a Fortune at a Throw, And with such Skill divert th'Impending Blow? Who in the Gap, when Force wou'd RIGHT devour, Will stand so firm against Unbounded Pow'r? Stemming the Tide of Violated Laws, Till he has made the Just the Prospe'rous Cause? O Britain! Thou, whose Happiness he sought, Whose Happiness he wou'd with Life have bought, Thy Peace his constant Aim, and still intending Thought; Let thy sad Genius now put Sables on, And thro' the Land diffuse her Faithful Moan, That ev'ry Eye may Weep, and ev'ry Breast may Groan! And Thou, O Learned Town! whose sacred Name Has been so long th'unenvy'd Theme of Fame; Thou, too, shoud'st in the Mourning Concert share, Scarcely so much thy Guardian Angels Care. Who e'er before made Thee appear so Great, Or in thy Civil, Learn'd, or Martial State? Or who hereafter (thro' more Tryals prov'd) Will leave Thee—so bemoan'd, and so belov'd? How did he Factious Fears and Doubts controul! How still Contention! and how tune the Soul! How baffle Envy! and how Silence Pride! In all Elections certain to Preside. Others to Feuds and Violence wou'd run, But where He came he made all Voices one. With a bare Breath they mov'd as he inclin'd, Like standing Corn all bending with the Wind. At once to RIGHT and ROYALTY a Friend; Nor did he to thy Burroughs recommend A needy Race, for Policy to bait, Like Gudgeons, catch'd with Pensions by the S?te. But while, blest City, I'd thy HERO show, I rove, and make Disgressions from my Woe. Ah! never! never cease to sigh his Name! So true to Honour, and so dear to Fame! Let all thy Sons bewail th'Exalted Man, And Thou, Immortal YALDING! lead the Van, Thou who new Force dost to our Langu'age give; He who so well can Praise, as well may Grieve. Ransack the silent Seat where Mem'ory lies, To bring our Woes Proportional Supplies: Let not the Hoary Dews of Lethe steep So many Vertues in Eternal Sleep: But as they pass our Intellectual View, Let Sorrow grave 'em deep, and keep 'em new: Then, when we have survey'd th'Amazing Store, Let us reflect their OWNER is no more! How all that's Prudent, Noble, Just and Brave, Is cover'd with Bertudor in the Grave! O Thought! that on the Rack does ev'ry Nerve constrain! Distraction were less Grief! and Dying gentler Pain. MENALCAS. My dear Alexis, if that Rain must fall, But speak the Hero's Worth—and weep it all. ALEXIS. It was my full Design:—but first my Friend, (And Prostrate I'll the sad Account attend) Tell by what Malady he hence was torn, With how confus'd a Grief the Loss was born, All Raving!—'twas too little, sure, to Mourn! He had to Human Sight no least Decay, Warm as a Summer Sun's reviving Ray, Nor Promis'd less than a long Summer's Day; Fresh as the Morning, when the Pearly Dew Foretells the bright Meridian to ensue: But there he stopt! there did the Gloom arise! Veil'd with surrounding Clouds from Human Eyes! Eclips'd! when most conspicuous in the Skies! Unwillingly the Rural Shades he left; (Unhappy Shades! of all your Joys bereft!) Never in Senate he deny'd his Aid; This only, only Time he wou'd have staid; But 'twas his Country call'd—whose Call he still obey'd. —But I prevent Thee; dear Menalcas, on; And—if I can—I'll stifle in my Moan MENALCAS. To tell you true (who e'er it may displease) He dy'd of the Physician;—a Disease That long has reign'd, and, eager of Renown, More than a Plague Depopulates the Town. Inflam'd with Wine, and blasting at a Breath, All it's Prescriptions are Receipts for Death. Millions of Mischiefs by it's Rage is wrought, Safe where 'tis fled, but Barba'rous where 'tis sought. A black, Ingrateful Ill! that, call'd to Aid, Is still most Fatal where it best is paid. So slight at first his Ail, it cou'd have done No further harm, but must of Course been gone, Had not this worse Malignance forc'd it on; And cruelly (till then all Pure and Good) With it's own Venom dash'd the circl'ing Flood.— By this time we the Hero's Danger found; He near Expiring, and we Weeping round. The Sighs of Widows, and the Orphans Cries, Importunate for Aid, besieg'd the Skies.— —And now the Fever seem'd in part t'Asswage; Death grinn'd a horrid Smile, and half forgot his Rage. As he grew better so the Town reviv'd, As Joy it self were from his Health deriv'd. But whether 'twere to shew, tho' ne'er so late, How fervent Prayer can turn the Course of Fate; Or whether 'twere a last expiring Glare, The fatal Hope that ushers in Despair; Or whether yet the Line of the Disease Cou'd be no further lengthn'd out for Fees, He soon relaps'd; relapsing weaker grew, And the pale Tyrant came again in view. Here Grief was at it's utmost stretch disclos'd, We all Confounded! he alone Compos'd. What Blessings did he to his Friends bequeath! What Joys describe! what dying Raptures breath! With what Assurance did he meet his Fate! How fearless pass th'inevitable Gate! His Soul had by Anticipation here, A Taste of Heav'n before it yet was there. O Truth! O Innocence! O peaceful Close! Hail him (ye Angels) to his long Repose.— But now an universal burst of Woe, Thro' all the Town did like a Torrent flow. The very Senate mourn'd his early Fate, Mourn'd this ADJUSTER of the Church and State; As quite despairing any more to see RELIGION reconcil'd to POLICY. The Clergy next their PATRIOT's loss deplore, No more to hear his Voice! to have his Smiles no more! In dangerous Times they freshly call'd to Mind, How diffe'rent Parties in their Aid he joyn'd; Then, with a Grief too big to speak in Tears, In Silence sunk beneath their former Fears: For ne'er before, in the most impious Age, Were they pursu'd with such invet'rate Rage, So slighted by the Great, and slander'd from the Stage. His Friends you next might see Distracted stand, Too weak the Streams of Anguish to Command: Nor Compass, Card, or Pilot left to Guide, They hopeless plunge into the raging Tide. But theirs, and ev'ry Grief the Poor's out-did, Tearing the very Earth up to be hid, And Raving Self-destruction was forbid! A frightful Prospect they before 'em see Of Wants, and unreliev'd Adversity, Ev'n those that knew him but by common Fame, With Tears repeat their common Patriot's Name. Nor less of our regard it ought to have, To think what Numbers mourn'd him to the Grave: With mutual Praise their mutual Sighs did vie, And from so many Mouths opprest the Sky— There rest his Ashes:—but his nobler Name, Expanding as it mounts the Starry Frame, Shall fill the expiring Breath, and latest gasp of Fame. DAMON. 'Tis done, the Task you bid Menalcas do; His Praise, a Nobler Task, we now expect from you. ALEXIS. That Praise, alas! shou'd be by Angels Sung, At least the first of the Castalian Throng: Not in my Numbers, broken, rough and lame, But Verse of the Duration of his Fame; Such as where-ever read shou'd sway in Chief; Mine's but the Duty of a Servant's Grief: Tho' yet (so much my Soul his Name reveres) What in my Stile unelegant appears, I'll sanctify with Truth, and polish with my Tears. Witness ye everlasting Lamps above, Ye sacred Lights that round us nightly move, Witness how oft, when the long Day was done, And all Devotion silent but his own, W'ave seen him on his Knees before th'immortal Throne. As if at neither Morning, Noon and Ev'n, There Hours enow to Piety were giv'n, Part of the Night in Prayer he always spent, The Time by most to Wine and Lewdness lent. No Hypocrite e'er with more Ardour cou'd Unseen be Ill, than he'd unseen be Good. What ever doing, or where e'er he were, His Privacies did no Detection fear; We ne'er cou'd find him when unfit to see, Nor hear him, but the Theme was Piety. No Faith by Works was ever readier shown, If when no Act of Charity is done, That Day be lost—He never squander'd one. As soon the Sun might cross from Pole to Pole, As soon the wand'ring Planets cease to roll, As he dismiss the Poor without their Dole. No Fears, by which our Scepticks are distrest, E'er found the least Admittance to his Breast: Where-e'er he turn'd his View, Sea, Earth and Skies, GOD, in his Works, was present to his Eyes. Unhappy they, that see this wond'rous Frame, And after make a Doubt from whence it came! His Converse, tho' 'twas cheerful, ne'er was vain; His Soul wou'd start to hear a Word profane: That fatal Rock where half our Nobles split, Lost for the poor Repute of having Wit: With such the Vertuous are the only Elves, But Devils are thought Angels by themselves. Where once he lov'd he never cou'd distrust; Kind to a Fault, and to a Scruple just:— But most, he most did fly the Snares of Lust. Not all the Darts thrown by the beauteous kind, That, Light'ning like, so quick a Passage find; Not all their Wit, and never ending Art, His once engag'd Affection cou'd divert, Or melt the Chastity that wall'd his Heart. Our Saviour's Precept he to Practice brought, And never, never lusted, not in Thought. And to reward his Truth, he twice was joyn'd In Wedlock to the best of Womankind. The first, the brightest purest Soul that e'er Was sent from Heaven, to shew us Mortals here What Angels and translated Saints are there! To see her once was ev'ry Charm to know Of Peace above, or Purity below; Imagination cou'd no further go! So Sweet her Form, th'Idea warms us yet!— But Ah! that Light in all her Glory set, In all her Youth (and we all drown'd in Tears) E'er she had numbred three and thirty Years: Yet thirteen times had call'd Lucina's Aid, And was as oft a happy Mother made. His Next did a like Scene of Joy presage; That sent to charm his Youth, and this to bless his Age. Her Mind so justly to her Form contriv'd, The living Wife but seem'd the Dead reviv'd. No Jot Impar'd, or less amazing bright, For her succeeding such a Glorious Light: A strange Eclipse had certainly been thrown On any Face, or Vertue but her OWN. Here were a Subject now our Voice to raise, To sing at once her Sorrows and her Praise! A Year! but one short Year in Wedlock run, E'er robb'd of all her Conq'ring Eyes had won! Her Eyes! a Charm that cou'd for Ages bind, Were Comfort certain, or had Fate been kind. Ah beaute'ous Widow! cou'd I think, when late The Muse did on your happy Nuptials wait, That such a Scene of Pleasure, Love and Light, So soon wou'd close in Everlasting Night! That one short Year wou'd so destructive prove To strictest Vertue, and the noblest Love! Ah! what avails our Hope, if Truth must here Be least, or latest Providence's Care? What Comfort have we to'wards the Goal to strive, If thus the Stream of Fate at Random drive? If all the Blessings of the Good and Fair Must, like a Bubble break, and end in Air! DAMON. You know there's none exempt from human Cares— But, Friend, you lose his Vertues in your Tears. ALEXIS. Forgive me, Damon, I've too long digrest; But who cou'd hold to see such Charms distrest? Vast are the Praises to his Vertues due, But some Regard must wait on Beauty too: Ev'n he himself wou'd Pardon such a Start, That give our Duty where he gave his Heart— —But to our View his Tempe'rance next appears, His fast Companion from his Early Years. In all th'Afflue'nce of a Wealth so vast, He ne'er the Common Bounds of Nature past. Tho' on his Board (where all the Seasons smil'd) What Earth cou'd furnish plenteously was pil'd; Tho' there the Sea a constant Tribute paid, And Richest Wines (declining Nature's Aid) Flow'd round, as from a Spring that ne'er decay'd; 'Twas but prepar'd, proportion'd to his Store, To feast his Neighbours, and to feed the Poor. Who born so high, wou'd yet so low descend? Then only Proud, when he cou'd serve a Friend. Upon his Word you, as on Fate, might rest; The rather, if it crost his Interest. To Truth ev'n his most trivial Thoughts did tend; As heavy Bodies sink, and Flames ascend. Ev'n Contraries his Meekness reconcil'd; As soon as Anger touch'd his Breast, 'twas Mild: Sternly he to the Beard wou'd Vice reprove, Tho' his Aversion still was meaning Love: From most, Resentment does in Hate con clude But his Concern was always for your Good. For ev'ry turn of Human Chance prepar'd, As none he Injur'd, so he nothing fear'd; For Vertue ne'er was missing from his Guard. Thus, by a wond'rous Mixture, you might find In him the Hero and the Christian join'd, The Loftiest Courage and the Lowliest Mind!— What shall we say?—unless by Angels penn'd, His Praises, like our Grief, can have no End. Nature her self does of this WORTHY boast, Aloud she cries—Here was no Labour lost: While to their Various Molds I'd others fit, Ten Thousand fail me for one Lucky Hit. Hereafter, when the Nobler Souls I Frame, Such as shall early get a Deathless Name, And late pursue the shining Chase of Fame, They by this PATTERN shall be all design'd; And, Copying him, Exalt the long Degraded Kind. MENALCAS. Were not your Sight subservient to your Moan, You wou'd perceive it is already done. What Copy can you hope to see so fair As that he drew in his Illustrious HEIR? Who is more likely Fame's now sinking Blast To lift again as high, and make it last? A Noble Character I grant y'ave drawn; But since 'tis Darkness there, look on the Rising Dawn: What Promises Bertudor's Worth can give, Like a new Eden, all in him revive. Then in our Hope his CONSORT with him shares; Born for his Ease, and soft'ning all his Cares, She does the Noblest Modern Instance prove Of Peace in Wedlock, and of Truth in Love. This happy Pair thy Sorrows shou'd divert; And never was a nobler Work for Art. DAMON. Begin, Alexis, let thy tuneful Song Paint him all Lovely, Affable and Young: Then let him shew the vast Advance his Youth Has made in Honour, Eloquence and Truth; How none to Pleasure e'er was less a Slave, More thro'ly Noble, nor more early Brave. With him, his Gene'rous Brother's Worth proclaim, Who all they owe their Birth will pay in Fame: In Peace, they shall the Arts of Peace adorn; Or War, if they for Bloody War are born. His Sisters then shou'd be Triumphant shown, Their Sables off, and all their Brightness on; Warming where e'er their happy Influ'ence flies, Love in their Mien, and Conquest in their Eyes! MENALCAS. As justly shou'd the fair Carnarvan's Name Be handed, with her Niece's, down to Fame: She who by Vertue does assert her Blood, And values less her Birth than being good: That Sister who so much his Loss deplor'd, And seem'd, at last, as hard to be restor'd: That Sister who to save him wou'd have dy'd, Who all his Sickness on her Knees wou'd 'bide— Ah! cou'd so bright a Suppliant be deny'd! Let not her num'rous Alms be hid in Night, Tho' private done, and flying human Sight: Nor shou'd her Chastity thy Pen decline, The hereditary Vertue of the Line;— Begin, and be thy Song as famous as thy Theme's Divine. ALEXIS. Ah Friends!—I grant my Duty owing there— But first (ye Pow'rs!) I'll first perform it here; First with a bleeding Heart, and weeping Verse, Pay my last Homage to Bertudor's Herse. That Office o'er, we to their Names will turn, There truly Praise, as here we truly mourn.— —But no such Theme shall now the Muse employ, No thought of Comfort, nor no dream of Joy! Faithful to Grief and wedded to my Moan, All my Relief shall be—to hope for None!— —Ha! Damon! where? whence come these dismal Cries? Shriekt out, as they were Nature's Obsequies! As if the general Doom just now were bid, And cleaving Earth were yielding up its Dead! MENALCAS. To the same Cause of Grief the Country yields; I spread the News thro' the Wiltonian Fields: No longer now bemoan'd by Swain to Swain, It gathers Head, and sweeps along the Plain: Like an impetuous Flood it all o'erbears— The Sadder Deluge, as 'tis made of Tears. ALEXIS. Lead on Menalcas.—This will be a Scene Fit to Indulge the Sorrows I am in! Hark! louder! how the sad affrighting Sound Does from the Hills back on the Plain rebound, And tells us—Death can now no deeper Wound! The Flocks and Herds run bleating o'er the Plains, And Sympathize with the Despairing Swains. Some dismal Tydings Heav'n's uncommon Rage, In Groans of Thunder, did last Night Presage. The Faithful Dogs in horrid Concert howl'd, And the fierce Wolves unguarded found the Fold, While croaking Ravens Death and Woe foretold! With Light'ning sindg'd, the blasted Heath is bare, And Horror is the sole Possessor there.— But let us haste and join 'em, now their Grief Is at the full, and hopeless of Relief. Bertudor is their Theme—Bertudor we Will cry, and Echo back their Misery. Bertudor! O Bertudor!—O no more! For ever now no more!— Away! and let me join the weeping Throng, To hear him Mourn'd, to hear his Praises sung, And die with the dear NAME upon my Tongue! Thealma, a Funeral Eclogue: On the Death of Mrs. Jane Roderick. Daphnis, Alexis, Almeria. DAPHNIS. Welcome, Alexis, from the Cambrian Air; Not more they griev'd the sweet Thealma there, Than thy long Absence was lamented here. —Ha!—from what Cause do these new Sighs arise? Why dost thou beat thy Breast and heave thy Eyes? Almeria's well; and she all other Loss supplies. ALEXIS. She is, indeed, of all my Joys the Chief, And 'tis that Thought which now revives my Grief: To see her will afresh my Woes renew, And set the dead Thealma full in View. O Friend! 'tis an Affliction so severe, As without strong Support I cou'd not bear! My Eyes scarce for the best of Master's dry'd, Before that dearest, best of Sisters dy'd! To what e'er Fate the rest of Men are born, I seem, my Daphnis, only made to Mourn. DAPHNIS. Too true, Alexis, we have oft been seen With Briny Tears to wet this Verdant Green: The Beaute'ous Flow'ers, in all their Balmy Pride, Have with the Fatal Moisture pin'd and dy'd: The Sheep, abandon'd, our Despair have told, And kindly, to divert our Sorrows, bleated for the Fold: But ne'er till this Inauspicious Hour Did I e'er see thee Rain so free a Show'r. ALEXIS. Ah Daphnis! (tho' it scarce may gain Belief) You see but now the Leavings of my Grief: Cou'd I my Loss, and all her Worth relate, You'd think I mourn her at too mean a Rate, Forget her Dead, and poorly side with Fate. DAPHNIS. I well remember (tho' but short her stay) When she from far a Visit came to pay; Her Converse not ev'n more by you desir'd Than here by all our Rural Youth admir'd, A Conq'ring Pow'r she in her Aspect bore, Made by an unaffected Sweetness more. No look was grating, and no Motion strain'd Yet Caution still preserv'd, and Decency maintain'd. The Study'd Arts, and ev'ry Am'rous Toil Which others use their Lovers to beguile, She render'd vain with one victorious Smile. Th'inviting Nymph does ev'ry Shepherd pall; She minded none, and yet subdu'd 'em all. When e'er we Danc'd, in graceful Movements, She Alone made Measure vie with Harmony: Others might look with a more lofty Air, But all in vain; she had the Eye, the Ear, Our Thoughts, our Looks, our very Souls were there! ALEXIS. And yet, my Friend, you in this Truth must join, Her Beauties then were just in their Decline: But if she warm'd ev'n in her Western Sun, Who cou'd withstand th'intenser Rays at Noon! A noble View in her Decay was shown, But, youthful all the Graces were her own. Those soft Remains so much admir'd by you, I saw, my Daphnis, in their vernal Hue, When Rose nor Lilly cou'd such Colour prove, Nor scarce th'Immortal Amaranth above! Then lay our Youth all Dying at her Feet; O truly Lovely! and Profusely Sweet!— This for her Form;—but in her Mind there lay A thousand secret Beauties, worthy Day; Nor shall they with her to the Grave retire, If Verse can Charm, or Love and Grief Inspire. 'Tis true, she mov'd in no Illustrious Sphere, But she the more cou'd influence being near; Tho' not of the first Magnitude in Light, Yet, in Proportion, equally as bright. Her Modesty was by some Angels drawn, The Colours mingl'd with the blushing Dawn; Nor in her Mind a meaner Station took, Tun'd by her Tongue, and sweetn'd with her Look! So chast her Converse, like a vestal Flame She breath'd a Purity where e'er she came. Whether it were her Goodness, Pow'r or Skill, When she reprov'd there was no doing ill; So much she calm'd the Blood, and sway'd the Will. No base Discourse (for not the nicest Ear Will the flagitious Sons of Lewdness spare) Cou'd to her Mind find out the smallest Track; Still met with Blushes, or sent blushing back. Her Vertues, like her Air, their Credit gain'd, As easie this as those were unconstrain'd. Thorny and rugged some believe the Way That leads to bliss,—or Thorns they there wou'd lay T'excuse themselves and others when they stray. Brought to a Habit; none e'er smoothlier cou'd Go on to Evil than she went to Good. In her all-kindly Eyes we might behold A wond'rous Goodness, never to be told! Thro' which was strangely and distinctly seen How all the happy Movements workt within: Like Hives of Glass that thro' the Fabrick shew How Bees dispose their rich Ambrosial Dew. Deceit and Pride, the Vices of the Fair, We might perceive had no Existence there: No Room in those bright Regions cou'd they find, So far her Sex was distant from her Mind Her Piety, at once sublime and strong, Was all around with holy Trophies hung; The Noble Fruit of Vertue rooted young. The time she cou'd from Rest and Business spare Was all Contrition, Penitence and Prayer. Nor was her Vertue of the rigid kind, Exposing ev'ry Errour it cou'd find; Nor stretcht its Censure to the inmost Thought, Denouncing Hell for ev'ry casual Fau't; Such Vertue is at best, so over-nice, A Virulence that but declaims at Vice. Hers always was a kind and Gene'rous Frame, That, being good, thought all the World the same. Her Openness 'tis true, with Wrong might meet; But better to be cheated than to cheat. Just the like Praise my own Almeria wins; By Nature Sisters and in Vertue Twins.— But does she still the same Impatience wear? I have not seen her yet, but sent she'd meet me here. DAPHNIS. Just as you left her;—still her Tears supply The Streams of Grief, as they wou'd ne'er be dry.— But wrapt in Sables, see! she hither hies, And her whole Soul as issuing from her Eyes! ALEXIS. Aid me, ye Pow'rs to Man it out!—and Thou O Friend! if ever, give Assistance now: The softest Thoughts that Comfort can excite Call to thy Mind,—and set her Notions right. ALMERIA. My dear Alexis! tho' too long your stay— Welcome! most welcome!—all I yet can say. I thank th'Immortals for thy safe Return:— But my poor dear Thealma's Fate I must for ever mourn! ALEXIS. O Let me in my Arms thy Body close! And here for ever hide thee from my Woes! The Debt I've paid that was Thealma's Due; Ah! do not—do not thou unman me too! Thy Sorrows with the last Distress I see; Nor longer can my Tears with thine agree, For now I grieve to take a Part from thee. ALMERIA. In vain, Alexis, You this Care impart, The Weight is sunk, and settl'd at my Heart; There like a heavy Mass of Lead it lies, Bleeds in my Breast and gushes from my Eyes. DAPHNIS. Mark, but how vainly Passion makes you move; Unjust to the two dearest things you Love! For her you mourn that is to Glory gone, And, careless, let Alexis languish on: Regard, Almeria, such a Consorts Peace; As 'tis your Grief he mourns, your Grief of Course shou'd cease. ALMERIA. 'Tis kind and I will struggle to forbear;— But I've a thousand Things to ask, and hear. Let there I beg, be nothing from me hid, Not the minutest thing she said or did: All the whole Progress, first and last relate, Her Sickness, Patience, Penitence and Fate: So strong a Ply to Goodness she receiv'd, She cou'd not die less vertuous than she liv'd. ALEXIS. Take then the History from the Day of Care I left thee wedded to Affliction here. All gloomy like our Sorrows, was the Morn. I parted hence, and Light did grudgingly return. Three weeping Days I travell'd thro' the Plain, Thro' rising Waters, and thro' falling Rain, Ambitious to ascend the Clouds again. Three more o'er craggy Cliffs thro' pathless Woods, By deep devouring Boggs and rapid Floods, I yet went on;—Impending Horrors there, And yet more frightful Precipices here. Thrice did we pass th'Averno's Raging Stream, All wild and dreadful as a Stygian Dream. Here to the Clouds th'aspiring Rocks did rise, And seem'd, like Atlas, to support the Skies: Down from their Ragged Sides the Cataracts roar'd, And in their Passage dismal Hollows boar'd. A hundred Spouts at once, with Echoing Sound, Their hide'ous Din did thro' the Air rebound. Mean while the Light'ning thro' the Gloom appear'd, But in this Scene of Terrors scarce was fear'd; Nor, tho' so nigh, was yet the Thunder heard. But now descended to the Neighbou'ring Vale, Patience and Courage too began to fail: A furious Torrent just before us lay, And not a Bridge, or Guide to point the way: Ten times we cross'd it—which with fresh Supplies, Pouring at once both from the Hills and Skies, Still as we further went did higher rise. But who can all our Dangers to You tell? Again we mounted, and again we fell. At last the Ocean to our View appear'd, Which more than all we yet had seen we fear'd: An Arm of which, a dange'rous Pass, there lay That we must cross;—there was no other way: The Ebb we watch'd; and was no sooner o'er, But we beheld it cover'd from the Shore, And all a Sea, where all was Sand before. The Winds by this time all their Fury try'd, And rais'd a Tempest to assist the Tyde, Which of it self all Human Pow'r defy'd. I that had never seen the Sea before, Shrunk to see Mountains tumble to the Shore; The Curling Waves each other Should'ring on, Like Routed Armies when the Field is won: Dashing the Rocks, they there their Pow'r contend; But there (the Fate of Pride) they all in Ruin end. ALMERIA. No more, Alexis; tho' I see you here, And Danger past, I yet that Danger fear; The bare Relation shocks my trembling Ear— It was unkind in me to let you go. ALEXIS. But 'twas Almeria, what you did not know— At last, there open'd to our View a Scene Of ample Breadth and ever verdant Green; Like that to which the Trojan Chief was led, After he past the Regions of the Dead: The Soil almost like ours, the Air as sweet, A Little Albion 'tis behind the Great, Where stands the Noble Griffithina's Seat. The happy Plains she there has govern'd long, Grace in her Mein, and Musick on her Tongue: Never was yet her Hospitable Door Shut to the Good, or slung against the Poor. Prudence and Vertue all her Actions Grace; Of vast Possessions, and an Ancient Race. Nothing she says, and nothing does design Unfit for a Descendent of her Line. This Noble Dame, to whom she long was known, Still lov'd our dear Thealma as her own, (The truest Breeding lowest Condescends) And Enter'd in her happy Roll of Friends. But vain, alas! her Pow'r, her Love and Skill, For here Thealma took her Fatal Ill; And (as she nothing yet but Health had known) At the first Seisure gave her Life for gone: Nor did the Thought her Fear or Doubt create, But strengthn'd her Submission to her Fate. As soon as Ill disposing her Affairs, All her Remaining Time was Prayer and Tears: Tho' ne'er was Life more distant from Offence, Or Death that less had Need of Penitence. But now the Malady much stronger grew, And to her Brain, the Seat of Reason, flew; At once did all her Train of Thoughts displace: And introduc'd, instead, a Raving Race: For Prudence (where there late so much was shown) We might enquire; but all, alas! was gone, All but Chimæra's, Dreams, and Notions not her own. ALMERIA. Unhappy Fate! to be so far Remov'd From all that lov'd her, and that best she lov'd: From all that Comfort to Affliction lends, Her near Relations and her dearest Friends! The very Thought she had not Pow'r to bear, Nor I, Alexis, scarce the Pow'r to hear! She had perhaps some Secret to unfold, Which she wou'd only to my self have told: This foster'd in her Heart a gnawing Pain, And sent up thence a Ferment to the Brain— Tell, I adjure you, if aright I aim; Did she not Sigh, and Rave Almeria's Name?— (Ah! cruel Heav'n! regardless of her Cries!) And wish me there to close her Dying Eyes! DAPHNIS. You that can thus find out new Ways to Grief, As well shou'd think on others for Relief. Can there a better Fate the Globe contain, Than to the last Repentant to remain, And then dissolve without the Sense of Pain? Wou'd you, Almeria, think your Doom severe, (And nothing does resemble hers so near) To dream of Heav'n, and, waking, find y'are there? ALEXIS. But now the Fever did its Rage abate,— In vain;—the Lagging Mercy came too late: So tho' a Vessel from a Storm's releas'd, Disable'd, it may sink when that is ceas'd. Howe'er, a Gracious Interval it sends, To take a last Adieu of all her Friends. There she to you her dying Love did give, And wish'd we long in Mutu'al Peace might live; That we'd prepare against our Hour came on, And least of all lament the SISTER gone. Here Sweetness she with Death did reconcile, And met the Grisly Terrour with a Smile!— O calm of Mind! O Visage free from Fears!— But ev'ry Face beside was hid in Tears! First Griffithina did her Loss deplore, And in her Looks a kind Dejection wore; Scarce for her HEIR she had lamented more. From thence the Fatal News o'er all the Plains Spread like Distraction to the Nymphs and Swains. But now the Day she was Interr'd is come And ne'er was Nymph attended nobler home! The loud Laments, so Gene'ral ne'er before, Half reach'd the Opposite Hibernian Shore. Those that had yet not griev'd her, here were mov'd; That all might mourn what was by all belov'd. O Edern! safe her Sacred Relicks keep, Till she Triumphant 'wakes no more to Sleep: And on her Tomb permit the Lines I grav'd;— Tho' for themselves they beg not to be sav'd. ALMERIA. Repeat to us, Alexis, what they were And—if my Tears will give me Leave—I'll hear. ALEXIS. To Molde'ring Stone our Memories to trust, Is to be soon forgot;—'tis Dust to Dust. Tho' her Good Deeds on Adamant were wrote With all the Life of Wit, and Strength of Thought, 'Twere yet in vain;—Or Fire, or Time consumes, And tumbles down our Temples on our Tombs. If we wou'd have her Vertues still in Sight, We must on Paper, not on Marble write: Some happy Genius draw her Image there:— These meaner Lines will serve to perish here. ALMERIA. No; be it thy Attempt to let her live;— Who knows what Date a faithful Praise may give? Not one of all the Patrons you bemoan Remember'd thee in Death as SHE has done: A Legacy she leaves that may excite The Coldest Muse to do her Vertues Right. ALEXIS. O there a Thousand other Causes are To pay that Duty,—and the least will bear. In all Distresses a most ready Friend; Such she began, and so at last did end. Beside, I doubly shou'd ungrateful be If I refus'd her Praise when 'tis desir'd by THEE; Nor shall the Subject longer be delay'd;— Inspir'd by thy Request, I'll seek no other Aid. A Noble Pile to Chastity I'll frame, With all beside that may advance her Fame, And set it out in dear Thealma's Name: Thealma! ev'ry Nymph and Swain shall sing, Thealma! all the Woods and Vallies ring, As Ceres just were ripe, or Flora op'ning spring. Ev'n distant Climes her Praises shall recite, And you at last confess I've done her Vertues right— All that Remains, is now to cease our Moan, And in our Mutu'al Love make up the Blessing gone. Divine Poems AND PARAPHRASES. A Contemplation touching Atheism. What e'er a Race of impious Men have writ, Or argu'd in their Wine to shew their Wit, There never yet was one so hardy found But in his secret Thought the GOD-HEAD own'd; Nor cou'd, with all his Labour and Debate, Suppress the Notions of a FUTURE STATE: CONSCIENCE wou'd thro' all Prejudice appear, And what he wou'd not Credit, make him Fear. 'Tis true, we grant it might much better be For such were there indeed no Deitie: Who wholly following a perverted Will, (As if Created only to be Ill) Wou'd fain perswade us no Reward succeeds A Vertuous Life, or Hell for impious Deeds; But as before our Births we nothing knew, So after Death we shall be nothing too Vain Men! that, for the poor Repute of Wit, Will stand eternal Fools in sacred Writ! 'Tis such that in their Hearts themselves deceive, And say what Reason never can believe; There is no GOD they softly whisper there, But softly whisper, least a GOD shou'd hear: So go on frontless, cleaving to the Sin, In Spite of Self-Conviction from within. Nor is this Method (I presume) a vain Ungenuine way that Scripture to explain. For how can any Creature that has ran Thro' Childhood, Youth, and now is reach't to Man; Whom Providence with it's own Hand has led, From Danger sav'd, and with Abundance fed, Perhaps while better Christians wanted Bread, How can this Wretch (tho' much a Sceptick dares) Doubt of that Goodness he so largely shares? Did he these Hints but seriously apply, And use his clearer Reason with his Eye, He wou'd not then so faithless look on high; Where the bright Sun has thro' all Times been found To take his Regular and Glorious Round, Create the Seasons as he comes and goes, Want it Himself, and give the World Repose. Where the pale Moon the Earth's low Globe befriends, And freely all her borrow'd Lustre lends; While her bright Train of Stars around appear, And shew 'tis only GOD cou'd place 'em there. Where Thunder rolls, and, breaking from the Cloud, Tells out Heav'n's angry Messages aloud; While pale the Atheist at the Sound appears, And owns at least th'Almighty in his Fears. Nor less the Work, when Thetis, to supply Th'exhausted watry Magazins on high, Does seem to lade the Sea into the Sky; Where with Prolifick Pow'r indu'd, in Rain The Genial Moisture spreads, and Covers all the Plain: While, Phœnix like, we Life from Death behold, And a New Nature rising from the Old! But most the Heav'ns his Majesty declare; The Fabrick shews who 'tis Inhabits there. Nor as on High (did we those Wonders prize) We neither shou'd in vain cast down our Eyes; Where such a strange Variety is shown, So vast a Bank of Treasure all our Own; What Man can wish, as Eden yet were new, With like Profusion op'ning to our view! Here smiling Flora does the Meads adorn, There bounte'ous Ceres loads the Earth with Corn: Next Autumn with her Riches courts the Eye, Aurora so does paint the Morning Sky! Ruddy her Fruits, and mellow'd for the Tast, As Brides with Blushes call to be embrac'd. But as all this were yet too small to give, And we amid'st such Wealth cou'd wanting live, No Distant Region but it's Product pours Upon our Soil, and makes it's Plenty Ours; Nor yet is Providence but bounteous here; But rains on all alike so vast a Share, That the most barren Country has to spare. From each to each, sent on the Watry Fields, No Nation wants what any Nation yields. Nor is the Winter of her Blessings short: But recompences naked Fields with Sport: The Horn and Hound revive us with their sound, And Wat's loud Knell is rung the Country round. Nor yet does Reynard scape the unequal Strife, But with his Death compensates for his Life. Return'd, in Bowls the Wine does spark'ling rise, And cheerful Fire the distant Sun Supplies; Nor stop we there, but with Discourse pursue The noble Theme, and run the Chase a new: A Subject that does Converse better fit Than fulsom Lewdness, or abusive Wit. Here Woods their Shady Fronts Expose to view, Which give us Fewel and our safety too; From these our Strength, our sailing Forts, we draw, Right injur'd States, and give Ambition Law. There humble Vales, and here aspiring Hills Are plac'd, and at their Feet harmonious Rills, Which from the Mountains are with Pleasure seen, Like the blue Veins thro' a transparent Skin; Alike their Office; for, (as Blood does do) Thro' Earth they take their Circulation too: While on their Banks the Shepherds chant their Lays, And the whole Theme is their Creator's Praise. Thus Order is by ev'ry thing obey'd, Order! the Word by which the World was made. The Rav'nous Beasts to their own Haunts repair, The Birds possess the Regions of the Air, The Fish thro' the Transparent Currents glide, And watch the Ebbs and Flowings of the Tyde; And when by Rain the Streams are rais'd, they post With them to Sea, and there with them are lost. There sportive Whales, those Living Islands, play, And scarce have room, tho' half the Globe is Sea. Thus, as above, below a GOD we see, And all his Works full of the Deity. Ev'n our own Weakness (strong in such a Cause) Shou'd humble us, and make us own His Laws; Not foolishly (and yet pretending Sense) With Impious Notions charge his Providence. We do not know why Grass that Colour wears, Or why our Blood the Sanguin Tincture bears; What makes the Painting in Heav'n's radiant Bow, Or gives that matchless Whiteness to the Snow: How dare we then the Sacred Name decry, And tax Incomprehensibility? A strange Perverseness, sure, to Man is giv'n, That knows so little, yet prescribes to Heav'n; That Gracious Pow'r who pardons, tho' blasphem'd; For Man Created how to be esteem'd! And how (O boundless Love!) for Man Redeem'd. But shou'd not this Great World incline our Sense To have a due Belief of Providence, The Lesser, MAN, at least shou'd Man convince. Who will against the Deity declare, That asks himself how He himself came here? Who 'twas that form'd him in the Womb, and who The Lumpish Mass with Reason did endue? What 'tis that makes him Argue, Think, and Move, Invent, Design, Distinguish, and Approve; And ev'n of old, so strongly in Debate Assert a GOD, and hope a Future State? When thro' a thicker Veil that Hope was shown, And Revelation totally unknown? What is all this but a most clear and bright Reflection, streaming from Eternal Light, And stampt into our Nature, to declare Whose Work we are, and Image 'tis we bear? Leaving it uncontestable, that none Cou'd our Producer be but GOD alone; Our Souls (that will a like Duration see) Th'Infusion of his Immortality: And tho' the Body must dissolve, it yet But suffers Death a better Life to get; As Gold and Silver, and sever'd from the Dross, Are made but the more glorious by the Loss. Tremble, ye Wretches, that wou'd Truth disguise, And tell us as the Body falls it lies; The Dead, you'll find, will certainly arise. I hear, methinks, the last loud Trumpet sound! I see the Quick'ning Bodies cleave the Ground! Lo! at the Gen'eral and Impartial Bar, All that were ever born at once appear, To take th'unalterable Sentence there! There! on the Left, behold the Impious Crew, Scarce thinking yet a Resurrection true! But glorious and exulting, on the Right, Rang'd by their SAVIOUR, stand the Sons of Light! There Justice does a dismal Scene display! Here Mercy opens an Eternal Day! Rejoice my Soul!—for tho' the Human Frame Must be dissolv'd, it yet will rise the same. Were Revelation wholly silent, yet Reason it self cou'd speak—and Reason's Wit. Cannot that GOD (so manifested there) Who did from Nothing make us what we are, Who to the Lifeless Dust did Being give, Raise up that Dust again, and bid it Live? Advanc'd to Heav'n, and crown'd with Glory there, If truly fitted by Obedience here. Less wond'rous 'tis the Dead new Life shou'd see, Than, e'er we did exist, it was to Be; As easier 'tis with Timber, Brick and Stone, To raise a stately Fabrick, than with none. The first the harder Work to Human Sense, Tho' both are equal to Omnipotence. This Life, that so Immoderately we Love, Is but the Shadow of that Life above. To Souls resign'd what Transport must it be To think, Hereafter ev'ry Faculty (So bounded here, and with such Frailties charg'd) Shall like the Minds of Angels be enlarg'd! I've said Y'are GODS—the Scripture does declare, No Figure then, we shall be like 'em there; All Truth shall know, all Knowledge shall comprize, And be without Deliberation wise. Those hidden Myste'ries that confound us Here, No more Abstruse, shall all lie open there: How Seeds of Things were first in Discord hurl'd, And how but—LET IT BE—did form a World; That Word which from old Chaos chas'd the Night, And out of Darkness struck Eternal Light. How the high Spheres were into Musick strung, And lasting Order from Confusion sprung. How Justice cou'd in Adam doom us all, Unborn, and unconsenting to the Fall. How in the Flesh th'Eternal Word abode, And how a Mother-MAID conceiv'd a GOD. How Mercy, to effect what it began, Cou'd suffer Death it self to Rescue Man. How ev'ry Language cou'd unlearn'd be known, How Unity and Trinity are ONE. There what has been from all Eternity, And what to all Eternity shall be, One endless Instant, we at once shall see! Mean while in Hymns the sacred Quires will move, They sing his Praise, and HE their Songs approve; For Heav'n is Heav'n by Harmony and Love. On then my Soul! the happy Path pursue This Noble Contemplation sets in view, Quit not thy Hope for all the Globe can give; 'Tis here to Dream, and only there to Live! The True FAST: A Paraphrase on the 58th of Isaiah. Cry! let thy Voice like the loud Trumpet sound, Thro' the wide Air diffuse it all around, To tell my People how their Crimes abound: Not but they outwardly pretend Delight To know my Ways, and practise what is Right: As if they ne'er did Trespass, or Rebel, They Justifie their Conduct, and think all is well. Wherefore (say they) do we make tedious Fasts? Thou see'st not, still thy Indignation lasts: To mortify our Lusts why do we roam, And wander such a wicked Way from home? Why such lean Penance do we undergo? Thou tak'st no Knowledge, tho' thou all dost know. Here me (O Rebels!) that can thus Report, Do you not Fast for Wantonness and Sport? Is it th'Effect of a well weigh'd Remorse? An Humbleness of Soul, or Form of Course? A Form, alas! a Form of neither Power or Force; A meer perverted Rite, an outward shew That neither me Delights, or Profits you. Under this specious Veil much Sin you hide, Contention, Hate, Hypocrisie, and Pride; Done chiefly that you may have room to blame The Wiser few that will not do the same, Participating in your Guilt and Shame; Such as the Nonsense of your Fasts detect, And clearly prove they are of no effect. But Fasts you call 'em, and you Fasts Proclaim, When Lux'ury oft were more the nat'ral Name: The Deep is ransack't, all her Treasures shown, For Flesh one Day deny'd, the Sea is all your own. In vain with this loose Custom you comply, In vain for this you lift your Voices high, They come lame Intercessors to the Sky. Observe (O stubborn Brood! your Maker's Voice, Is this the Fast which I have made my Choice? Is this t'afflict the Mind?—to Sigh and Moan, And drawl my Name out with a ruful Tone; To be in Publick seen with Heads reclin'd, Like Bull-Rushes that bend without a Wind; To dress in Sack-Cloath, and the Lash to feel, With all th'External Pomp of Hair-brain'd Zeal; What Merit on such Trifling can you lay? Or can this be to ME a Fast, or acceptable Day? Whose Eyes thro' the most dark Recesses see; Thy Thoughts, ev'n yet unborn, lie open all to Me. No, no; the Fast with which I'm pleas'd is this; Not to Connive at the least thing amiss: To fly from willful Sin, and ev'ry way In which th'unwary Soul is led astray; To break the Yoke where e'er the oppress'd you see, Redeem the Slave, and set the Debtor free: Ne'er to forbid the Dole to those in Want, But ready still at ev'ry Boon to Grant; For he that has but Little yet may be, By giving Little, sav'd for Charity: To think not thy own House too fine, or great, For the poor Out-cast to Sojourn and Eat; Unjustly, oft, from their Possessions hurl'd By Cruel Powe'r, and hunted thro' the World: To let the Mourning Widow be thy Care; To fence the Orphan (Shudde'ring, Wan and Bare) From the Inclemency of Winters Air: To be to no Indecent Rage beguil'd, But lead a Life all Merciful and Mild; Hiding from none the Will of doing Good, But least to those of thy own Flesh and Blood: Not to Detraction to let loose the Rein, With Gybes and Scoffs, (the Sport of the Profane) But free thy Lips from all Obscene and Vain. Reach but this Goal and Happiness you win, This is a Fast indeed!—a Fast from Sin. Then thou shalt be exempt from ev'ry Pain, Thy Health shall quickly come and long remain: All thy Good Deeds shall in the Front appear, And Glory shall attend 'em in the Rear: Thy frustrate Prayers their Fate no more shall mourn, But meet a Gracious and a swift Return: From dark Obscurity thy Light shall rise, And take it's Lofty Station in the Skies; The Sun himself shall hardly shine so bright, Hardly diffuse around a more Refulgent Light. Nay more, (for Nothing from thy View I'll hide,) 'Tis I my Self, ev'n I will be thy Guide, I'll set Thee in the Path, and mark the Way; O happy Man that cannot go astray! In Famine Thou shalt daily have Supply, In tedious Droughts Thou never shalt be dry, But, like a water'd Garden, still be Gay, Or Fountain rising in a shiny Day, Whose Springs ne'er fail, but ever mount and Play: The long rais'd Structures, now with Rubbish fill'd, Thy Sons again shall gloriously rebuild; But thine shall be the Credit, thine the Praise Both of the Present, and all after Days; Yes this was HE, the General Voice shall cry, That fill'd the Breach, and rais'd our Ruins high; That did our Temples to our God restore, In all the Pomp they were adorn'd before; That the waste Places nobly did renew, And gave those Temples Congregations too. And if to this thou add these Vertues more, I'll yet add greater Blessings to thy Store. If from all loose Desires thou turn'st away, Not following Pleasure on my Holy Day, Unless the Pleasure that is most Sublime, Not that of Wasting, but Redeeming Time! If still the Sabbath Thou with Joy dost see, (For He that Honours That does Honour ME;) Wish with Impatience for it's coming on, And when 'tis with thee that 'twou'd ne'er be gone; Not walking in the least the Worldly Way, Nor after dull Enthusiasts run astray, Distrusting still thy self, and cleave to what I say: In the True Fast that I have nam'd remain, (For t'other's Superstitious, Fond and Vain;) Then Thou shalt be my Darling, my Delight, Dear to my Soul, and pleasing to my Sight! High I'll advance, and far diffuse thy Name, The Globe shall be too Narrow for thy Fame: With me to Heav'n I'll carry it along, An Endless Theme for the Celestial Song. All Nature's Products too thou shalt command, And feed upon the Fatness of the Land; 'Tis I have spoke it—and My WORD shall stand. The HARLOT: A Paraphrase on the 7th of Proverbs. Young Man, let what I speak Attention draw, Observe it as you wou'd Heav'n's strictest Law; Hear my Commands, and rivet to thy Heart My Precepts fast, that they may never part: Do this, You'll quickly find the good Effect, But swift Destruction follows the Neglect. To Wisdom say—Thou my fair Sister art, My Hope, my Guide, and Goddess of my Heart, Dearer than Life! with Life I'd sooner part! And Chastity thy near Relation call; Get these (O happy Youth!) and thou hast all: No better Gift can Bounte'ous Heav'n bestow, No safer Guard from Human Ills below. Envy may Hiss, but she can do no harm; She flies, or dies before the Pow'rful Charm. Particularly, it will keep thee free From the loose Strumpet's speci'ous Flattery Whose Words, like Oil on Rivers, glide along, Her Words, more tuneful than the Sirens Song; The Charming Accent fixes all around, Ev'n Vertue, tho' it quit th'Enchanted Ground, Seems yet to move reluctant from the Sound. Fly, as 'twere Death, the Inhospitable Coast, But once incline to hear her, and y'are lost; All Human Aid will then arrive too late; Lost to Remorse, and hurry'd to your Fate: While on her Wanton Breast your Head you lay, For one Thought that advises—Rise; Away! You'll have ten Thousand pressing you to stay— But let the Wretch's Fate which here is shown Incline you to be careful of your own. Just in the Close and shutting up of Day When the last Gleams were hurrying swift away, The Harlot's Hour her subtle Trains to lay; As in my Window I stood leaning out, Thoughtless of Ill, and gazing round about, Among the Youthful Train a Wretch I spy'd, That neither wou'd his Guilt or Folly hide; What shou'd have been his Shame he made his Pride. For to his Drabs Apartment he was bent; His glowing Cheeks discover'd his Intent: Pleas'd with the Thought he scarcely touch'd the Ground, But like a Mountain Roe, did leap and bound. But Lo! she met him, coming forth to see For some kind Friend of her Fraternity; For any Fop had serv'd as well as he. Th'Experienc'd Harlot that wou'd gain by Sin, Must trapes as well without, as Trade within, In ev'ry Street, and ev'ry Corner ply, To angle Coxcombs as the Shoal goes by: As soon as e'er the Bait appears in sight, There's scarce a Gudgeon passes but does bite. Have you e'er seen (what Time the Seasons yield Such kind of Sports) a Spaniel range the Field, And mark'd what Pains he takes to set his Game? Th'Industrious City Drab is just the same. Thus strait the Youth she spies, and round him cast Her Snowy Arms, she press'd, she held him fast; And with an eager and a close Embrace Laid Cheek to Cheek, and squeez'd him to her Face. Bare were her Breasts, and Careless her Attire, Learn'd in the Art how to inflame Desire, And kindle what was found too apt to take the Fire; Harlot thro'out; she not a Gesture made But writ her Punk, and perfect in her Trade— But after some fond Looks and Dalliance past, Thus the fair Faithless tun'd her Tongue at last. 'Tis Peace (said she) 'tis Peace and Love I bring, This Day I've paid my Vows, and made my Offering, And therefore came I forth; with thee to meet, Thus late, and thus alone, I rove the Street. The Dangers of the Night affright not me, At least they vanish at the Sight of thee. Without thee what a tedious Night I'd past! And who knows, too, but it had prov'd my last? Depriv'd of thee must have strange Tortures wrought, And plung'd me deep in Melancholy Thought. But I have found thee; long I've wisht it so; And it shall longer be before I let thee go. I've deck't (my Love) I've deck't my Bed with Flow'rs, Not sweeter were the Gods delicious Bow'rs: With costly Tap'stry I have hung my Room, Not richer ever stretch't the Tyrian Loom: There Venus is in all her Postures wrought, And how Love's Pleasure she with hazard sought, Surprizing to the Eye! transporting to the Thought! Perfum'd with richest Scents, such as Inspire Gay Loves! and melting Joy! and soft Desire! Come then, away, and take of Love our fill; In Passion such as ours there is no Ill. Let Aged Matrons rail, and Gown-men Preach, They are too wise to practise what they Teach. Away, and let me plung into thy Arms, Find you the Love and I'll create the Charms. Come till the Morning let us Sport and Play, Nor rise the sooner for it's being Day. Nor let the Thought of Husband pall your Joy, He's now far distant on a grand Employ; Cash he has took long Charges to defray, And will not come till his appointed Day; And (O ye Gods!) I wish he never may! My Right in Him I'd willingly resign; Millions of his Embraces are but One of thine. But ah! the Hours have Wings—away! away! Let not the precious Time be lost when Love and Pleasure stay. With her fair Speech She forc'd him soon to yield, But Force is needless when we quit the Field: Too credulous, her Flatt'ery he believ'd, Nor was he the first Fool she had deceiv'd. She turns, he follows; nor his Joy conceals; Or sees Destruction dog him at the Heels. As Oxen to the Slaughter (wretched State!) So on he Walks, unmindful of his Fate; Or as a Vagrant to Correction goes, To lasting Scorn he does his Fame expose: So the wing'd Racers, to their safety blind, Haste to the Snare and meet the Death design'd. In vain, at last, he sees the Ills h'has done, His Life is going, and his Wealth is gone. Disease o'ertakes him, makes his Health a Prey, Meagre and Wan he looks that once was Gay; His Winter, his December comes in May, Too late his Lustful Hours are Understood, He feels her hot Embraces in his tainted Blood. With Aches crampt and strong Convulsions torn, Pox, Stone and Gout, too Grievous to be born. He lies and roars, (not Hell a Torment worse,) Till his last Breath evaporates in a Curse. Hear me (O Youth!) and to my Words attend, Dispise 'em not because I am a Friend, But persevere, and Glory Crowns the End. Let not thy Footsteps to her Paths decline, She's all a Devil, tho' she seems Divine: Strip her but of her Perfume, Patch and Paint, And see how fit she's then to be a Saint; Then mark her shrivel'd Face, and sallow Skin, Rank all without, and Rotten all within.— And yet such soft Delusions she'll display, The Rich, the Noble, Witty, Wise and Gay, The Great, the Strong have been by turns her Prey. Warriours themselves have by her Arts been slain, Have lain down by her, but ne'er rose again. Her House is the wide-gaping Gulph of Sin, From whence there's no Return whence once y'are in: Down to the Courts of deepest Hell it goes; O don't thy safety to this Rock expose, 'Tis but a Kiss you gain, and 'tis a Soul you lose. The ATHEIST: A Paraphrase on the second Chapter of the Wisdom of Solomon. Our Days th'Ungodly cry, the Impious throng, (Thus Reas'ning with themselves, but Reas'ning wrong) Our Days, they cry, uncertain are and few, Yet, tho' so short, they oft seem tedious too. As against Death no Remedy we have, So none that die can e'er unclose the Grave. At meer Adventure born;—no Planet's Rule Does dub this Man a Knave, or that a Fool: By Chance produced, and by like Chance destroy'd, Like Beasts we Perish in the Boundless Void. Hereafter shall, when once we are no more, Be the same thing to us as Heretofore: To the same State we shall again retire, And, dying once, Eternally Expire. The Breath no more the silent Lungs shall heave, No more than Smoak, when it the Wood does leave, Shall Ages hence to the same Body go, To be breath'd out again in Smoak, as now. Life is, at best, but only at the Heart A Hovering Flame, just trembling to depart; A while it moves, a while its quick'ning Heat Diffuses Warmth, and gives the Pulse their Beat; But once extinguish'd, Darkness does invade The Mind, and wrapt it in perpetual Shade: Away the various Notions madly fly, Born down the Endless Tide of Destiny. No Mention of us when w'are gone shall stay, But with our Names our Mem'ories flit away: A Black Lethean Veil our Works shall hide, And on th'Eternal Basis fixt abide, Quite over-whelming all Laborious Pride: The Body, too, to crumbling Dust shall fall, And a Profound Oblivion swallow all. As where the Clouds have been no Paths appear, So not a Track of What, or How, or Where, Life leaves behind; dispers'd like Dew it flies, Exhal'd into the vast extended Skies. So light! so vain! when once we disappear, W'are not so much as our own Shadows were. Ah Foolish Man! when of the Grave possess'd, To think there's ought will thy Repose molest; 'Tis that's the Region of Eternal Rest: No Resurrection, or feign'd Trumpet's Blast Can reach us there;—the Sleep of Death will last, And long Annihilation seal the silent Mansions fast. What then remains but quitting Future Fear And Future Hope, we take our Portion here? No Man th'Enjoyments past can back recall, And for the Future, 'tis uncertain all: The Present's Ours, which we'll to Pleasure give; No Man e'er yet began too soon to live. All Nature's Rarities before us stand, Pour'd out with a most free and copious Hand: What she profusely gives, profusely we Will wast, and Ape her Prodigality: Make Life but one Debauch—Youth shall engage For Manhood, Manhood give the Reins to Age: At least while Youth does last we'll Joy prolong; He that knows only Pleasure dies not Young. With costly Wines be all the Goblets crown'd, And moving swiftly take their flowing round: See how it sparkles! how the Flavour sends An Invitation to its Youthful Friends, And, rising to the Brim, its Quick'ning Pow'r commends! Nor let to Wine the Woman wanting be, The Crown of Love! and Soul of Extasie! Who twisting round us ev'ry Fibre drains, She emptying still as 'tother fills the Veins. Rich Ointments let us on our Temples pour With Libe'ral Hand, as 'twere an April Show'r, All her Rich Progeny let Flora bring, Her Groves of Balm, and Fragrance of the Spring: Chiefly the Rose unwither'd let her bear, The Queen of Sweets, add Glory of the Year! Voluptuously let each enjoy his Part, Of all that can be reach'd by Pow'r, or Art: Where e'er we come all Sadness we'll destroy, And set up Feasting, Laughter, Love and Joy. This is the Portion that to Man is giv'n, And if not this there is no other Heav'n. The Meagre Wretches who our Ways oppose, (To all our sensual Pleasures Mortal Foes) Let us with black opprobrious Scand alload, And pelt with Jests when e'er they peep abroad: To their own Cloysters let the Moaps be pent, Serenely dull, and gravely Impudent: There let 'em wast their Time in fruitless Prayer, Address'd to Pow'rs that neither see, nor hear. No Reve'rence to the Aged let us show, For Nothing's due to those that Nothing know: Like us Voluptuously their Youth they spent, And now they can't be wicked wou'd be Innocent. Nothing that's just or sacred let us prize, Compassion banish from our Hearts and Eyes, Nor spare the Widow for her dying Cries; The senseless Dame that shuns to be embrac'd, When 'tis Ill Nature only makes her Chast. Extortion, Fraud, and Rapine let us ply, There's no Injustice in Necessity. By Force, the Life of Government, we'll awe; For nothing that's Precarious can be Law: All Ancient Times no Right but Force allow, And as 'twas then by Consequence 'tis now. Behind that Guard undaunted let us stand, And the meek; senseless, Right'eous Tool command, With growing Rancour and unless'ning Hate Pursue him, Credit, Person and Estate. His own Designs we'll on him grinning turn, And give him Sorrow that wou'd make us mourn. By musty Rules he wou'd our Actions awe, And brands us for offending Israel's Law: In us our great Progenitors he blames, And in our Breeding their Neglect proclaims; Says Impious Notions Impious Deeds beget, Our Learning Insolence, and Blasphemy our Wit. Nor does he stop ev'n there; but to our Eyes Wou'd make that glaring Spectre Conscience rise, To take the Chair, and fright us from our Joys. He seems, as 'twere, maliciously design'd To thwart, reprove, and search the Inmost Mind, The Secrets of that hidden World t'explore, And probe th'uneasie In-mate to the Core: There he wou'd ev'ry Thought and Act survey, And bring expos'd to the clear view of Day. His Counsels wound us more than Him our Scorn, Nor is his Sight to be with Patience born. He shuns our Lux'ury, ridicules our Wear; His Works and Ways have quite a different Air. In Death he Cries, what e'er we here may boast, We shall be founder'd on the Stygian Coast, And find a Soul—ev'n when we find it, lost. Our Doings he with Detestation flies, Death to our Ears, and Poison to our Eyes! From certain Truths wrong Infere'nces he draws, And calls us Beasts for follo'wing Nature's Laws, Tho' we as sharply might retort again, They, by that Reason, might as well be Men. The End of the Just Man he happy calls, Tho' scorn'd he lives, and unlamented falls. Thus he believes all Knowledge to him giv'n, And proudly calls himself a Son of Heav'n. But let us look his vain Opinions thro', Not take 'em crudely at a distant view. While Fools about Futurity contend, We'll mark what does befall him in the End. For if the Man that Holiness does boast Be Son of God, he will not see him lost; He will not suffer Vice to strut before, And Vertue follow, base, despis'd and poor: In worst Extremities, tho' ne'er so low, He'd raise him up, and save him from the Foe. Let us then prove the Force of his Pretence With Hate, Abuse, Disgrace and Insolence; We by such Usage to the Quick shall go, And find his boasted Patience all a Show. If there we fail, the last Extreme we'll try, And doom him Ignominiously to Dye: If then Deliverance come (for God, if there Be such a thing as God, will then appear) If then by Miracle he aid Receive, We will Respect his Word!—but not till then believe. Such things they did against the Just devise, For their own Wickedness had clos'd their Eyes; Deliver'd over by their Lust and Pride, (As if they'd sworn to have no other Guide,) To a most Reprobate and Devilish Sense Of Justice, Mercy, and Omnipotence. By vain Imaginations, self deceiv'd, No Good they Practis'd, and no God believ'd. As for the Peace, Protection, Truth and Love, Stream'd from the high Creator Thron'd above, They feel 'em not, nor think from whence they came Lost to Remorse, and hardn'd in their Shame: So thick a film of Sin their Sight controuls, They see not a Reward for Blameless Souls; Nor that our God created Man to be An Image of his Own Eternitie. Thus, Devil-like, they wilfully are blind; And, Devil-like, are for that Hell design'd Which Here they'l not believe—and there must find. The HAPPY MAN. A Paraphrase on the 15th Psalm. Who, Gracious Lord, shall be on Earth possest Of all that's Good? nor only here be blest, But, when this Life is done, obtain Eternal Rest? Ev'n he that takes delight in Prayer and Praise And in that Path walks Steady all his Days. Whose firm Integrity no Strength can force, No Sin corrupt, or Sanguin Law divorce. Whose full Intention and whose sole Delight Is to speak Truth, and do the thing that's right. In whom Deceit and Flatt'ry have no part, But lets his Tongue be guided by his Heart. That to his Neighbor has no Evil done, But rather warn'd him how that Ill to shun. That lets no Rancour mingle with his Phrase, Ill Men t'Encourage, or the Good debase; A Foe to Slander, and a Friend to Praise. That looks on his own self with humble Eyes; Nor thinks he is too Vertu'ous, or too Wise By Loss to gain, and Lowliness to rise. That takes to find out Peace a certain Guide In keeping down the Timpany of Pride. And as he walks in a Religious Fear, So all that love Religio'n makes his Care; Excites their Diligence, their Ardor warms, Their Faith enlarges, and their Patience Arms. That faithfully performs the thing he vows; And ne'er commits the Sin he disallows; But if he ought have to his Neighbour sworn, Fulfil it, tho' he meet with Loss, or Scorn, And let th'Affliction cheerfully be born. That has not Pity of the Poor forsook, Or for his Money lent Extortion took; Or sided with Successful Pow'r and Laws, To murder and destroy without a Cause. Pow'r, Pleasure, Glory and Ambition must Stoop low, and lay their Airy Heads in Dust, The Heav'ns sink down and crush this nether Ball— But he that so will stand shall never fall. Hymn for Christmas-Day. I What Words? what Voices can we bring? Which way our Accents raise To welcom the Mysteri'ous King? And sing a SAVIOUR's Praise! What Earthly Harmony can reach Up to the Theme so high? When Angels ne'er cou'd soar that Pitch, Who dwell above the Sky. II Lo! Heav'n this Day descends to Earth, Th'Immortal Mortal grows! Made Man by this stupendious Birth, To quell our Deadly Foes: In swadling Bands the Godhead lies, To Human Flesh debas'd, That we, his dearly Ransom'd Prize, Might be to Glory rais'd. III Sing! let the Universal Frame The Great REDEEMER Sing! And Men and Angels at the Name Bow to the Mystick King! Redemption be the General Sound, This Day no Grief appear! From Earth to Heav'n the Notes rebound, And Mercy smile to hear! IV O 'tis too little, all we can, For this unbounded Love! All that was ever writ by Man, Or sung in Hymns above! But tho' we can't fit Language find, We Praise! Believe! Adore! With Joyful Hearts, and Souls resign'd; And wish we cou'd do more! Hymn for Easter-Day. I If Angels sung a SAVIOUR's Birth On that Auspicious Morn, We well may Imitate their Mirth Now He again is born. He, frail Mortality shook off, Puts Incorruption on; And He that late was crown'd in Scoff, Now fills th'Eternal Throne. II Grieve not vain Man, who Mortal art, That thou to Earth must fall; It was his Portio'n 'twas the Part Of Him that sav'd us all: Himself He humbl'd to the Grave, Made Flesh, like us, to shew That we as certainly shall have A Resurrection, too. III Let Heav'n and Earth, in Concert joyn'd, His boundless Mercies sing; Ev'n Hell does now a Conq'rour find, And Death has lost his Sting. If, when in Eden Adam fell, The whole Creation groan'd; The whole Creation, sure, shou'd smile, Now Justice is aton'd. IV Hence all ye Faithless, far away, That this great Myst'ery flight; They that deny an endless Day Will find an endless Night: Beyond Time's short and scanty Bounds The Soul shall surely live; But when the last loud Trumpet sounds, You'll then too late believe. Hymn for Whit-sunday. I He's come! let ev'ry Knee be bent, All Hearts new Joy resume; Let Nations sing with one Consent, The COMFORTER is come! No Anxio'us Thought molest our Peace, This Day all Grief retire; Let ev'ry Fear for ever cease, And ev'ry Doubt expire. II There is no end of the Content And Joy the Spirit brings! Happy the Man to whom 'tis lent! That Man sees wond'rous Things! What greater Gift, what greater Love Can God on Man bestow? 'Tis half the Angels Heav'n above, And all our Heav'n below. III Hail Blessed Spirit! not a Soul But does the Influe'nce feel; Thou dost our Darling Sins controul, And fix our Waveri'ng Zeal: Thou to the Consciene dost convey The Checks that all must know; Thy Motions first does point the Way, Then give us Strength to go. IV As Pilots by the Compass steer Till they their Harbour find, So do thy sacred Breathings here Guide ev'ry wand'ring Mind: The Flesh may strive our Course t'impeach, The World's rough Billows roar; But following Thee w'are sure to reach The safe, Eternal Shore! On Good Friday. I No Songs of Triumph now be sung, Cease all your sprightful Airs; Let Sorrow silence ev'ry Tongue, And Joy dissolve to Tears: See! where opprobriously for us Our bleeding SAVIOUR's nail'd! Ah see! while Death he suffers thus, How much our Sins prevail'd! II We were devoted to the Stroke, At us the Bolt was thrown; He stept between, the Torture took, And made our Guilt his own. Ah! think what Agonies he felt! How vast the Weight he bore! And let your Souls in weeping melt, And bleed at ev'ry Pore! III Desponding—let all Heads decline, All Arms be hung across; Let Angels in our Sorrows join, And Nature groan his Loss! The op'ning Graves, the Temple torn Our Stony Hearts shou'd rend; Shou'd make us melt shou'd make us mourn, Nor only mourn but mend. IV If at this Sight we don't Repent, What other Sight can move! Ingrateful! shou'd we not relent, And pay such Love, with Love: If still Contrition is forgot, And we our Sins retain; As far as it concerns our Lot, He yet but died in vain. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME the SECOND. [SATYRS]. PROLOGUE To the following SATYRS. To that Prodigious Height of Vice w'are grown, Both in the Court, the Country, Camp and Town, That 'tis of late believ'd, and fix'd a Rule, Who ever is not Vitious is a Fool; Hiss'd at by Old and Young, despis'd, opprest, If he be not a Villain, like the rest: Vertue and Truth are lost—search for Good Men, Among ten Thousand you'll scarce meet with Ten; But Fools and Knaves you ev'ry where may find, Almost as universal as Mankind. The other Sex, too, whom we all adore, When search'd, we still find Rotten at the Core; Their Love all false, their Vertue but a Name, And nothing in 'em constant but their Shame. What Saty'rist then can Honestly sit still, And, unconcern'd, see such a Tide of Ill, With an Impetuous Force o'erflow the Age, And strive not to restrain it with his Rage? On Sin's vast Army seize, Wing, Reer, and Van, And, like Impartial Death, not spare a Man? For where, alas! where is that Mighty He From Lewdness, Pride, Deceit, and Envy Free? What better Work can, then, employ our Thoughts Than to expose their Follies and their Fau'ts; And set before their Eyes a faithful Glass? For who won't mend that sees he is an Ass? And this Design 'tis that employs my Muse, This for her Daily Theme she's proud to choose; A Theme that she'll have daily Need to use. Let other Poets scrape, and fawn and lye, And eat the ill-got Bread of Flattery; She yet cou'd ne'er cringe to a Lord for Meat, Change Sides for Inte'rest, hug the City Cheat, Nor Praise a Prosperous Villain, tho' he's Great: Quite contrary her Practice shall appear; Unbrib'd, Impartial, Pointed, and Severe: That Way my Nature leans, compos'd of Gall; I must write sharply, or not write at all. Tho' Wl?r wings the Air in tow'ring Flights, And, to a Wonder, Panegyrick writes; Tho' all along he's Noble and Sublime, Scarce to be match'd by past or present Time, Yet what Instruction can from hence accrue? 'Tis Flatt'ry all, too fulsome to be true. Urge not (for 'tis to Vindicate the Wrong) It causes Emulation in the Young, A Thirst to Fame, while some high Act they read, That spurs 'em to the same Romantick Deed; As if some pow'rful Magick lay in Rhimes That made Men braver than at other Times; 'Tis false and fond;—Hero's may huff and Fight, But who can Merit so as he can write? To hold a Glow-Worm is the Morning Star, And that it may with Ease be seen as far, Were most Ridiculous, so wide from Truth, It justly wou'd deserve a sharp Reproof. That Wretch is more to blame, whose Hireling Pen Calls Fools and Villains wise deserving Men; Says that the Vitious are with Vertue grac'd, Judges all Just, and all Court Ladies Chast. If to be Prais'd does give a Man Pretence To Glory, Honour, Honesty and Sense, Cromwell had much to say in his Defence; Who, tho' his Name does ev'ry Ill Comprize, Has been extoll'd and lifted to the Skies: While living (such was the Applause they gave) Call'd Princely, Pious, Faithful, Wise, and Brave, And with Encomiums waited to the Grave. Who then wou'd give this—for a Poet's Praise? Which, rightly understood, does but Debase, And blast the Reputation it wou'd raise. Hence 'tis (and 'tis a Punishment that's fit) They are reproach'd and scorn'd by Men of Wit. 'Tis true, some Foplings nibble at their Praise, And think it Great to grace the Front of Plays; Tho' most to that Stupidity are grown, They wave their Patron's Praise to write their own. Yet they but seldom fail of their Rewards; And, Faith, in that I cannot blame the Bards: If Coxcombs will be Coxcombs, let 'em rue, If they love Flatt'ry let 'em pay for't too, 'Tis one sure Method to convince the Elves; For Fools are the best Satyr on themselves. In short, nought helps like Satyr to amend: While in huge Volumes differing Sects contend, And let their vain Disputes ne'er know an End, They plunge us in those Snares we else shou'd shun; As Tinkers make ten Holes in Mending One. Our dearest Friends, too, tho' they know our Fau'ts, For Pity or for Shame conceal their Thoughts; While we, who find our Failings not forbid, Loosely run on in the vain Paths we did. 'Tis Satyr, then, that is our truest Friend; For none before they know their Fau'ts can mend: That tells us boldly of our foulest Crimes, Reproves Ill Manners, and reforms the Times. How am I then to blame? When all I write Is Honest Rage, not Prejudice or Spite? Truth is my Aim, with Truth I shall impeach, And I'll spare none that come within it's Reach. On then, my Muse, the World before Thee lies, And lash the Knaves and Fools that I despise. To the Right Honourable CHARLES, Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, &amp;c. My Lord, The Widow's Mite cast to the Store Was more than all, for she cou'd give no more; The Rich, indeed, might daily Presents bring, As flowing from an inexhausted Spring: I say not so that you shou'd Partial be, Or think this more because it came from me, But just to tell, I am as Poor as She: As Poor, I mean, in Sense, as She in Coin; Nor is that Mite originally Mine: 'Tis true, a Mite is in it self but small, But vast the Store that gives a Mite to all: You are that Store, my Lord, whose boundless Mind, In Judgment firm, in Fancy unconfin'd, Distributes Rays of Sense to all Mankind: With Piercing Wit the very Soul you Charm, Instruct the Wise, and make ev'n Dullness warm! It is but just then (as the Gods Inspire Our Human Clay with this Celestial Fire, Which, when the Lifeless Carcass finds a Grave, Returns again to the same Pow'r that gave,) I shou'd that little—All I have—restore; But blush to think it is Improv'd no more. I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's Faithful And most Humble Servant, R. GOULD. LOVE given Over: OR, A Satyr against Woman. At length from Love's vile Slave'ry I am free, And have regain'd my Ancient Liberty: I've shook the Chains off which my Bondage wrought, Am free as Air, and unconfin'd as Thought: For faithless Silvia I no more adore, Kneel at her Feet, and Pray in Vain no more: No more my Verse her Beauties shall proclaim, And with soft Praises Celebrate her Name. Her Eyes their usual Lustre cease to bear, At least, to me, there seems no Lustre there; Her Frowns no more can cause, or Kindness cure Despair. I've Banish'd Her for ever from my Breast, Banish'd the Proud Invader of my Rest, Banish'd the Tyrant Author of my Woes, That robb'd my Soul of all it's Sweet Repose: Not all her Treach'rous Arts, Bewitching Wiles, Quick-heaving Sighs, or soft deluding Smiles, Shall my Eternal Resolution move, Or make me think, discourse, or dream of Love: The Whining Curse I've rooted from my Mind, And with it, all Regard of Womankind. Come then, my Muse, and since th'Occasion's fair, Against that Sex proclaim perpetual War, Which may renew as still my Verse is read, And Live when I am mingl'd with the Dead. Woman!—Ye Pow'rs! The very Name's a Crime, Not to be reach'd by Wit, or Spoke in Rhime! The very Sound, like Pestilential Fumes, Dispences Plagues and Woes where e'er it comes, Infernal Clamours, fierce Domestick Jars, With all the Influ'ence of Invet'rate Stars. In vain their high Original they boast; The true Records undoubtedly are lost. Heav'n must it self (intranc'd) like Adam lie; Or else some Banish'd Fiend usurp'd the Sky When Eve was form'd, and with her Usher'd in, To stock the World, another World of Sin. The Fatal Rib was Crooked and uneven, From whence they have their Crab-like Nature giv'n, Inverting all the Laws of Man and Heav'n. O Lucifer! Thy Regions had been thin, Were't not for Woman's propagating Sin; But for that Sex you might have Room to spare; Now Crowding's not the smallest Torment there. To quick Damnation ev'ry Path they know; So truly Fond of Vanity and Show, That ev'n to Hell they'll have Attendants too: The Lame, Dismember'd, Noseless and the Blind, Recover'd Fluxing, wait 'em close behind: The Pox, their Usher, passing on before, Gleans as it goes, and makes their Triumphs more. In the Obscene and most envenom'd Parts, The Paphian Boy of late dips all his Darts, Exposing ev'ry Am'rous Ass to shame; For Love and Pox are but a Common Name: But these are Crimes the Sex will Venial call;— Nay there is hardly one, among 'em all, But Envies Eve the Glory of the Fall: Be Cautious then, and Guard your Empire well, Nor vain your Fear; for shou'd they once Rebell, They'd surely raise a Civil-War in Hell, Add to the Pains you feel, and make You know W'are here above as curst as You below. But here, since Woman's Lust I've chanc'd to Name, Woman's unbounded Lust I'll first proclaim; And prove our Modern Age has brought to view, What Sodom, when at worst, had blush'd to do. True I must grant you Rome's Imperial Whore (More fam'd for Vice than all the Crowns she wore) Into the Publick Stews disguis'd wou'd thrust, To quench the Raging Fury of her Lust; And by that Method bravely got her Name Born up for ever on the Wings of Fame. Yet this is Poor to what our Modern Age Has hatch'd, brought forth, and Acted on the Stage; Which for the Sex's Glory I'll rehearse; And make it Deathless, as that makes my Verse. Who knew not (for to whom was she unknown?) Our late Illustrious Bewley? (true, she's gone To answer for the Num'rous I'lls sh'as done; For if there is no Hell for such as She Heav'n is unjust—and that it cannot be.) As Albion's Isle, fast seated in the Main, Does the rough Billows raging force disdain, Which tho' they highly threat, and loudly roar, In vain attempt t'unfix the Rooted Shore, That Millions of 'em breaks, and calls for Millions more; So she, with Lust's Enthusiastick Rage; Sustain'd at once the Lewdness of an Age, Whole Legions did encounter, Legions tir'd, Insatiate yet, still fresh Supplies desir'd. Prodigious Bawd!—O may thy Mem'ory be Abhor'd by all, as 'tis Abhor'd by Me! Thou fore-most in the Race of Infamy! But Bodies must decay; for, 'tis too sure. There's Nothing from the Jaws of Time Secure. Yet when she found she cou'd perform no more, When all her Body was one Putrid Sore, Studded with Pox and eating Ulcers o'er; Ev'n then, by her delusive treach'rous Wiles, For Woman 'tis that Woman best beguiles) Sh' enrolled more Females in the List of Whore Than all the Arts of Man cou'd ever do before. Prest with the Pond'rous Guilt at length she fell, And thro, the solid Centre sunk to Hell: The Murm'uring Fiends all hover'd round about, And with hoarse howls did the Great Bawd salute; Amaz'd to see a sordid Lump of Clay Stain'd with more bold and various Crimes than they: Nor were her Torments less; for the dire Train Soon sent her howling, thro' the rowling Flame, To the sad Seat of Everlasting Pain. Greswel and Stratford the same Footsteps tread; In Sin's black Volume so profoundly read, That, when so e'er they die, we well may fear The very Tincture of the Crimes they bear With strange Infusion will Inspire the Dust, And in the Grave commit true Acts of Lust. And now, if so much to the World's reveal'd, Reflect on all the Sins that lie conceal'd: How, oft into their Closets they retire, Where Flaming D?do does inflame Desire, And Gentle Lap?d?s feed the Am'rous Fire. How curst is Man! When Brutes his Rivals prove, Ev'n in the Sacred Business of his Love! Unless Religion proper Thoughts instill, Shew me the Woman that wou'd not be Ill, If she, conveniently, cou'd have her Will? And when the Mind's Corrupt, we all well know The Actions it consents to must be so: Their Guilt's as great, an Ill resolv'd to do: As their's who Actually that Ill pursue: Their Will to have it so their Crime assures; Thus, if they durst, all Women wou'd be Whores. Forgive me Modesty, if I have been, In any thing I've mention'd here, obscene. And yet, why shou'd I ask that Boon of Thee, When 'tis a Doubt if such a thing there be? For Woman, in whose Breast, Y'are said to Reign, And shew the Glorious Conquests thou dost gain, Renounce the Virtue, and but court the Name. Sounds, tho' we can't perceive e'm, we may hear, And wonder at their Echoing thro' the Air: Thus, led by what delusive Fame imparts, We think thy Throne's erected in their Hearts; But w'are deceiv'd, as all our Fathers were, For if thou Art at all, 'tis sure thou art not there. Nothing in that black Mansion does reside, But Spite, Contention, Luxury and Pride: PRIDE is the Deity they all adore, Hardly their own dear Selves they Cherish more: Survey their very Looks you'll find it there;— How can you miss it when 'tis ev'ry where? Some thro' all hunted Nature's Secrets trace, To fill the Furrows of a Wrinkl'd Face; And after all their Toil (observe the Curse) They've only made a Ruful Visage worse: So some that wou'd have plated Mony pass, Decrease the Silver, and betray the Brass. Nay those that have the Blessing to be fair, And know how Charming and admir'd they are; Who one wou'd think Created so compleat, They had no need of Artifice and Cheat. Yet they, too, in Adulte'rate Washes share, And wou'd, if possible, be more than Fair. Deluded Woman! Tell me, where's the Gain Of wasting Time upon a thing so vain? Your Precious Time! (O to your Selves unkind!) When 'tis uncertain Y'ave an Hour behind That You can call your Own; for tho' y'are bright As Summer's Sun, and mild as op'ning Light, Adorn'd by Nature, and display'd by Art In all the Glories that delude the Heart, The Frowns of Age no Favourite Charm will save, Nor all your Sweets Protect You from the Grave; The Grave which favours not the Rich, or Fair; Beauty with Beast lies undistinguisht there. But hold—methinks I'm Interrupted here, By some Vain Fop I neither Love, or Fear; Who in these Words his Weakness does reveal, Exposing Wounds he rather ought to heal. Soft, Sir, methinks you too Inveterate grow, And more Your Envy than Discretion show. Who blames the Sun because He shines so bright Our weak Perception dazles at the Sight, When at the self-same time He cheers the Earth With Genial Heat, and gives all Nature Birth? How does the Winter look, that Naked Thing, Compar'd with the Fresh Glories of the Spring? Rivers adorn the Earth, the Fish the Seas, The Smiling Flow'rs the Meads, and Fruit the Trees, The Stars th'Æthereal Fields thro' which they ride; And Woman all the Works of GOD beside! Yet the Malicious Satyr won't allow They shou'd adorn themselves:—Then pray, Sir, now Produce some Reasons why Y' are so severe; For, Envious as You are, You know they're Fair. True, Sir, and Sodom's Apples heretofore Were Beaute'ous too—But Rotten at the Core. Nature we grant has all her Offspring Fair, And well they all their Maker's Pow'r declare; The Woods, the Hills and Dales their Echo's raise, The Feather'd Quire to Him direct their Lays, And Joyful Rivers run his Endless Praise! But tho' they've held so many Ages on, All their Inherent Worth is yet their Own. Nothing but vain fantastick Woman's chang'd, And quite from all her Native Truth estrang'd: 'Tis true She has the same Alluring Skin; All Paradise without!—But Hell within. Her talk of Vertue but a vain pretence, Her Love a Trade, and Gain Her Innocence. Nor is it but the Beauteous we deride, Th'Unhandsom are as much the Slaves of Pride: The Short, the Straight, the Crooked, Foul and Fair, Have all Promiscuously an Equal Share: Not to be vain, and Haughtily inclin'd, In short, is not to be of Womankind. But tho' so many of their Crimes are nam'd, 'Tis yet untold for which they most are fam'd; A Sin, tall as the Pyramids of old, From whose Aspiring Top we may behold Enough to damn a World:—What shou'd it be But (curse upon the Name!) Inconstancy? O tell me does the World those Men contain (For I have look't for such, but look't in vain,) Who ne'er were drawn into that fatal Snare? Fatal I call it, for He's curs'd that's there. Inspir'd then by my Fellow Sufferer's Wrongs, (And glad I am the Task to me belongs) I'll bring the Fiend un-mask'd to Human Sight, Tho' hid in the Black Womb of Deepest Night. No more the Wind, the faithless Wind, shall be A Simile for their Inconstancie, For that sometimes is fix't; but Woman's Mind Is never fixt, or to one Point inclin'd. Less fixt than wanton Swallows while they play In the Sun-Beams to welcome in the Day, Now Yonder, now they're here, as quickly there; In no place long, and yet are ev'ry where. Like Ships in Storms their Passions fall and rise; One while You'd think they touch'd the very Skies, When in a Moment they the Sands explore; Lost to their View that stand upon the Shore Ev'n Silvia, She her Self, the lov'd and Fair, Whose one kind look cou'd save me from Despair, Whose Smiles I valu'd at so vast a Rate, To compass them I scorn'd the Frowns of Fate; Ev'n She her Self—(But Ah! I'm loth to tell, Or blame the Crimes of One I lov'd so well— But it must out?) Ev'n She, swift as the Wind, Swift as the Airy Motions of the Mind, At once prov'd Faithless, Perjur'd and Unkind! Here they to Day Invoke the Pow'rs above As Witnesses to their Immortal Love, When, lo! Away the gawdy Fantome flies, And e'er it can be said to live, it dies. Thus all Religious Vows and Oaths of late They think no more than other Common Chat. Nor is that sacred Idol Marriage free; Marriage, which Musty Drones affirm to be The Tye of Souls as well as Bodies,—Nay, The Spring that does thro' secret Pipes convey Fresh Sweets to Life, and drives the bitter Dregs away; The Sacred Cloud, the Guardian Pile of Fire That guides our Steps to Peace, nor does expire Till it has left us Nothing to desire: Ev'n thus adorn'd, the Idol is not free From the swift Turns of their Inconstancy. Witness th'Ephesian Matron;—She in whom, As in a Mirror, thro' all Times to come We see the Wives Resolve, and Husbands Doom: To the sad Grave with her dead Spouse she went, And clos'd Her Self up in his Monument; Where on Cold Marble She lamenting lay; In Groans She spent the Night, in Tears the Day, And seem'd to have no use of Life but mourn it all away: The wond'ring World cry'd up her faithful Mind, Extoll'd her as the best of Womankiud! But see the World's Mistake; and, with it, see The strange Effects of wil'd Inconstancy! For she her self, ev'n in that Sacred Room, With one brisk Vig'rous onset was o'ercome, And made a Brothel of her Husbands Tomb! Whose pale Corps trembl'd in its Sacred Shrowd, Wond'ring that Heav'n the Impious Act allow'd: Horrow in Robes of Darkness stalk'd around, And thro' th'affrighted Tomb did Groans resound: The very Marbles wept; the Furies houl'd, And in hoarse Murmurs; their amazement told! All this shook not the Dictates of her Mind, But with a Boldness, Natur'l to her Kind, She made her Husbands Ghost (in Death a Slave) Her Necessary Pimp ev'n in his Grave. What need I fetch these Instances from old? There now live Thousands both as bad and bold, Of Noble Birth, Lascivious, Young and Fair; But for their Husbands sakes their Names I spare. Are these (Ye Pow'rs!) the Vertues of a Wife? The Peace that Crowns a Matrimonial Life? Is this the Sacred Prize for which we fight, And hazard Life and Honour with Delight? Balm of the Day, and Rapture of the Night! The Reins that guide us in our wild Careers? And the Supporter of our Feeble Years? No! no! 'tis Contradiction; rather far They are the Cause of all our Bosom War; The bitter Source and Fountain of our Woe, From whence Despair and Doubt for ever flow; The Gall that mingles with our Prime Delight, Rank to the Taste, and nauseous to the Sight; A Days, the Weight of Care that Clogs his Breast, At Night the Hag that robs Him of his Rest: Our Mortal Sickness in the mid'st of Health, Chains in our Freedom, Poverty in Wealth, The Eternal Pestilence and Rack of Life, Th'Original and Spring of all our Strife; These Rather are the Vertues of a Clam'rous Wife. Why was it, ye Immortal Pow'rs, Your Will To mix our Grains of Good with such a Weight of Ill? Or did You think our Crimes wou'd Soar so high For Your Corrections handed from the Sky, And so made them Your Vengeance to supply? For not the wide destructive wast of War, Nor yet the smarter Butchery of the Bar, That Ruin to all Humankind contrives, And murders more Estates than 'tother Lives; Nay not the Plague when it does madliest Rage, And half depopulates a Fruitful Age; Nor any other Evil we can find That pains the Body or distracts the Mind; Not to old Age perpetual Loss of Health, Nor yet that grinning Fiend Despair it self, When it insults with most Tyrannick Sway, Can teeze, or torture Man so much as They! Urge it no more, they were Created Good, 'Twas not a Moment in that State she stood; Swift as a Meteor glides thro' Air she fell, And but for Heav'ns Surmounting Grace had doom'd us all to Hell. Beware, then, vain and thoughtless Man beware, Nor let Lascivious Women be the Snare To make You the Companions of 'em there. Think what it is in endless Flames to fry, With Strumpets and their Devils Laughing by: Think what the Pox, the Stone and Gout are here; Afflictions scarce to be exceeded there. Scorn their Vain Smiles; their Little Arts despise And Peace of Mind, at such a Value prize, As not to let those Rav'nous Thieves of Prey Rifle, and bear the Sacred Guest away: 'Tis they that rob us of that Precious Gemm; We cou'd not lose it were it not for them. Avoid 'em then, with all the treachr'ous Arts They daily Practice for Unguarded Hearts' Avoid 'em as You wou'd avoid there Crimes, Or they themselves, Hereafter, wou'd my Rhimes, Design'd to lash 'em down thro' all succeeding Times. And now shou'd any Coxcomb (for we may Find yet too many that will own their Sway) Shou'd such revile the wholsome Rules, I give, And, in Contempt of what is taught 'em, live Like base Soul'd Slaves, and Fetters chuse to were, When they may be as unconfin'd as Air, Or the Wing'd Racers that inhabit there: May all the Plagues a Woman can invent Pursue 'em with Eternal Punishment: May they—but stay, my Curses I forestal, For in that One is comprehended all. But say, Sir, if some Pilot on the Main Shou'd be so mad, so resolutely vain, To steer his Vessel on that fatal Shore Where he had seen ten thousand Wreck'd before! Tho' he shou'd Perish there, say, wou'd you not Bestow a Curse on the Notorious Sot? Trust me, the Man's as much to blame as He, That Ventures his frail Barque out, willfully, On the Rough Rocky, Matrimonial Sea; Selfish, his Heart is with vain Hopes possest, For why shou'd He speed better than the rest? THE POETESS, A SATYR, Being a REPLY to SILVIA's Revenge. ? Revenge at first, tho' sweet, Bitter, e'er long, back on it Self recoils: Mil. Par. Lost. Why, foolish Woman, are You so Enrag'd To see my Satyr and your Sex engag'd? Can one poor Muse sustain so vast a Shock As they can Frown, and Laugh, and Lye, and Look? Ten Thousand Aids they to their Side can bring; The Satyr only but employs Her Sting. Nor did she Vertue ever yet molest, But Praise it, Thriving; and Defend, Opprest. Vice is her Sole Aversion, and 'tis there Sh' has sworn, tho' ne'er so Mighty, not to Spare; But Lash, without Distinction, Sex and Age, While there's an Object left to whet her Rage: And that, no doubt, there will forever be;— At least, as long as We are plagu'd with Thee: Thou ill Defender of a Cause as ill; Revenge your Motive; and, the Guide, your Will. Thy Fulsom Pen prepost'rous 'twas to foul, Since it but shews the Blackness of your Soul; Which now y'ave prov'd, by this Audacious Task, Of the same Fiend-Complexion with your Mask: Mark't for the Stygian Colony below, It Here does Practice what 'tis There to Do: All You have Writ does shew Y'are thence Inspir'd, And only there can hope to be admir'd; For Men detest Thee; nay, so far y'ave gone, Y'ave pull'd the Womens Indignation on, As in the Sequel shall at large be shown. Of all your Sex, You are the most unfit To vindicate their Chastity, or Wit: Among the Rest some Sparks of Worth may shine, And from their Bosoms dart a Gleam Divine; But they for ever are Extinct in Thine: In Thee the Sun of Vertue's Set, and lies Eclips'd in loose Desires, no more to rise, And with its Maiden Glories gild the Blushing Skies. Ephelia! poor Ephelia! ragged Jilt, And Sappho, famous for Her Gout and Guilt; Either of those, tho' both debauch'd and vile, Had answer'd me in a more Decent Stile: Yet Hackney Writers, when their Verse did fail To get'em Brandy, Bread and Cheese, and Ale, Their Wants by Prostitution were supply'd; Shew but a Tester, you might up and ride: For Punk and Poetess agree so Pat, You cannot well be This, and not be That. Than thou, ev'n these had better Conduct shown, Preserv'd their Sexes Fame, and half retriev'd their own. Shew me one Page, of all the Angry Store, Exempt from Terms like These;—Jilt, Strumpet, Whore, Hag, Hot-House, Fluxing, Leach'ry, Emp'ricks Bills, Claps, Cully, Keeper, Pox, and Pocky Pills; Words that wou'd shock the Modest Matron's Ear, And make her Blush to think a Female fixt 'em there.— But what are those You Hag and Harlot Name? Women! what the Destructive Bawd? The Same: What Drabs and Maud'ling Gossips? Women still! Yet Woman You'd defend from being ill. Methinks I hear the Hebrew Nymphs again— Thy Thousand Thou, and Thou hast Thousands Slain: Tho' many Crimes I nam'd, I more conceal'd; But, there's no counting those by Thee reveal'd! Which tho' 'its Certain there's not One but True, Were yet not Things to be disclos'd by You: You on their Failings shou'd have drawn their Veils, And not obscenely shewn their Cloven Feet and Tails: Since complicated Vice in Man appears, Enough to Exercise thy Rage for Years, What need so lavishly Exposing Theirs? Compar'd with Thee, I'm careful of their Fame;— But sure, You only Scribble for a Name: And since Y'are fond of it, Your Name shall live; What You can't give your Self, perhaps, my Lines may give. Above all former Shame You shall be sham'd, Till Y'are at last so Infamously fam'd, That Bawds, thro' all their Brass, shall blush to hear You Nam'd. Wretched is She that dares to be thy Friend, But far more Wretched whom You once Commend: For tho' She might for Modest pass before, Thy Praise wou'd Transubstantiate her to Whore. Not One e'er pass'd thy Panegyrick Quill, Describ'd as Good, but was extremely Ill. For Proof; what is that Silvia you defend? What but a Train of Guile without an End? In Circulating Crimes she round does move, Thinks Falshood, Prudence; and Her Lewdness, Love. Expensive, Idle, Arrogant and Vain; And ne'er had such a Bulk so little Brain: Not She who in your Commendation writ, (Whose Worth and Verse with Thine exactly fit,) Has more of Garbage, or has less of Wit. But here you'll ask me, by mistaken Rules— What are the Men that fall in Love with Fools? But pray Reflect,—When w'are of Cupid's Train The Motion's just Eccentrick to the Brain: Nature must Reason from her Seat remove: If she'd Preside, and give the Reins to Love; Who, while the Blood her Craving Itch supplies, Deceives the Crafty, and Confounds the Wise. Thus, made, by an Insulting Passion blind, In Silvia's Form I cou'd all Sweetness find, And all Perfection extant in her Mind. But now the Am'rous Films are dropt away, And I can Objects, as they are Survey, A Thousand Ills I've in that Nymph descry'd, Which Nothing but a Love like Mine cou'd hide. Restless her Will, Licentious her Desire, Now Chilling Ice, and now all flaming Fire. Her Love so little to her Promise fixt, That if this Hour is Heav'n, 'tis Hell the next. Perjur'd from Head to Foot; so strangely foul, She's blackn'd thoro' to the very Soul!— Not but that Love, plac'd in a Gen'rous Mind, With Truth adorn'd, and Chastity refin'd, Is an Affection of Cœlestial kind; For then no Guilt it does in Thought contract, And but Regards the Issue not the Act. Unlike is Silvia's;—to such Grossness giv'n, No Thought affects her like a Turkish Heav'n; Where Sixty Years, She says, must duly run. Before one Act of dear Coition's done. Such odious Crimes I Justly Reprehend; So known a Jilt unjustly You defend: It speaks Thee plainly to her Guilt a Twin, In Sense as Shallow, and as deep in Sin, And perhaps Deeper;—as the World may find In that Part of Iambic yet behind. In my most sullen and Invet'rate fit, (As most of Anger still has least of wit,) I ne'er said Maiden-Heads were Nothing yet: Without a Blush thus far with Thee we'll Joyn, They are meer Nothings all, if all like Thine: How can you ward the Beaut'ous Sex's Blame That thro' their Purity wou'd wound their Fame? Virginity, that Angel State, wherein Cou'd they but live, (almost) they wou'd live free from Sin That Charm remov'd, what thoughtless Youth wou'd care, (Meer Lust excepted) to approach the Fair? Why are we fond? why Languish and adore But to have something never had before? To be the first that Crops the Virgin Flower, Just in the Critical, and Blissful Hour When the strong Watchful Guard resign their Pow'r; No longer by her Ignorance kept in awe, But side with Hymen's more Seraphic Law; When in the Blushing Virgin's Kindling Eyes We see a sort of Yielding Sweetness rise, When pregnant with a Thousand Nameless Charms, She dies away, and Sinks into your Arms; Then Grasps, breaths short, her Glowing Eye-Balls rowl, And a Convulsive Rapture seizes on Her Soul! The Certainty they've been of that Possest, Does make a Calm in ev'ry Husband's Breast; It gives ev'n Marriage a delicious taste, And is the Oyl that makes those Colours last. Who ever tyes that Miserable Knot, And thinking sure to find it, finds it not, Words are too Poor to paint his more than Cursed Lot! For she that let her Tail to hire before, Has now a Specious Mask to gild the Whore: But She that brings it to the Nuptial Bow'r, She that preserves it Sacred to that Hour, Has in her future Conduct double Pow'r; For what in Maids Virginity we Name, In Chast and Faithful Wives does ripen into Fame. But Thou, accurst, and destin'd for our harm, Cou'd never find the lucky Hour to charm: Thou ne'er wert capable to give Delight, All Lust your Love, as all Your Anger's Spite. When you were Young, and for a Change might please Some Fop that did not Fear the foul Disease, We never heard of Thee in Lines like these; Then 'twas Amintor, Strephon, Gentle Swain; And Songs, (writ in a Melancholy Strain) Made known thy want of Venus thro' the Plain. Not all thy Prime so fortunate cou'd prove, Among such Crowds, to give One Creature Love. What now then when thy Borrow'd Charms have fail'd, The Paint wash'd off, and all the Fiend unveil'd; And not a Refuge left to drudge for Life, (Now past a Bawd) but to Commence a Wife; A Wife! If any Man so rash will be To leap that Horrid Precipice for Thee: That Husband's Fate in Wedlock's hard to guess, Only thus far—that Hell's a Torment less. Yet Man You curse; and Woman, his Delight, He must not see by Day, nor touch by Night, Why, cou'd You do Your Sex a Plaguier Spite? Or yet your self? for ev'ry Eye may see That Curse wou'd fall most heavily on Thee: From Fifteen on to Fifty thou hast known What Man was Carnally, nor lain alone Without one, two, or more, but with Regret and Moan. But well, You shew Y'are of th'Inconstant Kind, Your Word a Riddle, and a Whirl your Mind: For tho' but now so fast Your Clapper ran To make Your Injur'd Sex abandon Man; Yet next w'are blam'd, that can so Barbarous prove, Drunk, to neglect the Great Affair of Love. Her fulsom Itch is far from being gone, That loves by Drunkards to be Belcht upon! What Modest Dame, that had a Spouse so ill, Wou'd not Implore her Stars to have him still? This Beastly Animal's beneath our Curse; But She that then can Fondle him, is worse, Swine as he is, cou'd he your Appetite But answer, you'd imbrace him with delight. As Wine's Provocative You like it well, But, as it Spoils Performance, hate it more than Hell; So not meer Drink occasion'd this Disgust, But as't un-nerves Desire, and baulks Expecting Lust. Is this the Wife to all Enjoyment lost? Is this the Female-Innocence You boast? If this may pass for Vertue, Bawds are Chast; Hags, grim as Death, are with all Sweetness grac'd; Beauty, not vain; a thrice-flux'd Actress, just; And Monarchs shining Strumpets free from Pride and Lust. But Thou, who in a loose and frontless Strain, Vertue, and Vertuous Women dost Profane, Blush first, then hear thy Injur'd Sex complain. For one, in Rage, is singl'd from the Throng, In Shape an Angel; and her Heav'nly Tongue, Her Speech to Thee directed, thus redeems Their Wrong. Shame of our Sex! What Rage inflames thy Breast? Or for Inspir'd, have you mistook Possest? In Maiden Verse, there shou'd no Words be seen But what reveals the Innocence within. Of things Ridiculous, I dare maintain Nothing's so senseless, frivolous and vain, As thinking all our Fau'ts in Publick shown When not a Line, but what unveils your own. A thousand Times be Harlots call'd Obscene, It no Reproach can to the Vert'ous mean: Nor does Adult'rous Wife reflect on me, While I walk Hand in Hand with Modesty; But she that does resent it, that Ill Wife is She. The Tender Place will quickly tell 'tis bare; For if we shrink, the Satyr Lances there: And this may be laid down a Standard Rule, Relate to whom it will; Punk, Pimp, or Fool. What Credit can to thy Defence accrue, But that his Satyr sat too close on You, And like Strait Stays made You unlace for Air? As Pounds imply what brought the Cattle there: Sated with Lawfull Grass they leap't the Bound: O never let us quit that Fertile Ground Where Vert'ous Herbage Springs, and Honour rais'd the Mound. His Hate of Falshood, not his Love of spite, Ground his Inveterate Spleen, and bid him Write: A Perjur'd Nymph depriv'd him of his Rest; When Her, and all like Her he banish'd from his Breast. Who dare Accuse Him for so just a Deed, To save the Corn by Rooting out the Weed? That Worth's his Care is plainly understood, For pulling down the Ill must raise the Good. Yet if You were Resolv'd to write to show Your Parts, (which don't distinguish Friend from Foe,) Why was it Rhime? (But Rage all Sense devours) That scandal to their Sex, and worse to Ours. 'Tis not as formerly, when 'twas the Use For Verse t'Instruct, as now 'tis to Traduce; As from your own Example can you plead excuse? Remember how the Chast Orinda Wrote, With all the Grace and Modesty of Thought? Rapt we all stood, nor knew which to prefer, Whether to read her Verse, or gaze on Her: Thro' all her works apparently does shine A Spark that shews her Nature was Divine; While only Spite and Fury Actuate thine. Our Female Poesie is chang'd since then; For Songs Obscene fit not a Woman's Pen: Nor Satyr is our Province; let 'em throw Their Darts, while we are Chast we ward the Blow. O! let us not be Snakes beneath the Flower. Nor Ill because we know it in our Power; But keep in thought the last, the scrutinizing Hour: For after Death a strict Account Succeeds; Our Idle Thoughts are Punisht with our Evil Deeds. Then thou dost talk of Love at such a Rate As drawn by Thee, 'tis what we ought to Hate, A freakish, Hair-Brain'd, Bess of Bedlam State. Love, the Soft Seal, by which alone we find Something of Angel stamp't on Human-kind; While we, like Wax, to the Impression bow, And find our Souls are One, we know not how And, like Translated Saints, Ascending flee, Rapt up to a Third Heav'n of Extasie. This is the Fate that Constancy does prove; And such is always the Reward of Purity in Love. But in thy Numbers 'tis a Lapland Witch Sailing thro' Air, astride, upon a Switch, Mumbling of Wicked, but successless Spells, And tho' You fail to hurt, it still your Envy tells. In short, both thine and Ariadne's Rage Only a General Ruin can Asswage: Both Good and Bad, at once, must blended go, And the whole Race be ended at a Blow; And all your Reason,—You wou'd have it so. What worst of Furies, (cou'd they have their Will) Wou'd talk so boldly, and Design so Ill? Forbear thy Scribling Itch, and Write no more; When You began 'twas time to give it o'er: What has this Age produc'd from Female Pens But an Obsceneness that out-strides the Men's? Succeeding Times will see the Diff'rence plain, And wonder at a Style so loose and vain; And what shou'd make the Women rise so high In Love of Vice, and scorn of Modesty. For why are You concern'd a common Whore Shou'd be turn'd off; and Providence once more Her Senseless Cully, to his Wits restore? Of Cashier'd Punks so feelingly You speak, You have been serv'd, sure, some such Slipp'ry Trick; And so by Sad Experience (as You sing) Know but too much of it;—a Barb'rous Thing! Your Language all along is Loose and Vile, We see your want of Manners in your Stile. Your Words Outrag'ous, but their Meaning weak, And writ with the same Caution Bullies speak. Coherence their is none; thy Genius warms No more than now thy Face, at Fifty, Charms. To all a Nusance, to Your self a Plague; And but a step between Thee and a Toothless Hag— But I forbear Thee; and may He forbear You write against, and not be too severe: If such Scurrility you long pursue, No Creature e'er will be so Maul'd as you: Your Fau'ts and Follies He'll to all make plain; And in his bold, Satyrick, angry Vein, Set a worse Mark on Thee than GOD on Cain. But may He spare Thee—Here she wou'd give o'er: And I will spare Thee;—for a Whore's a Whore. To S?. Fleetwood Sheppard, &amp;c. While the vain Fop his vainer Mistress sues, Growing more Slavish as he longer Wo's, (For she but flies because the Sot pursues) You, Sir, a safer, nobler Way have ran, For an ill Age a general Good began, And shewn the Ways of Liberty to Man. Unpitied let the Husband mourn his Strife, That Wo's, and Lyes, and Labours for a Wife. Mean while to you our Praise we justly pay, Whom Woman's utmost Art cou'd ne'er betray, Or all her Charms seduce to quit your Native Sway. Learning and Prudence rais'd you safe above The Snares of Wedlock, and the Smiles of Love; In their Embrace a nobler Prize you sought, And to their Empire lasting Conquests brought. 'Twas strange to be the Foe of Love so Young. But stranger to retain the Bent so long. Nor Heat of Youth, nor yet your Elder Years (For many a Man is fonder as he wears) Cou'd ever plunge you in that Sea of Cares. Constant to Peace, you still avoided Strife, The Rocks, the Shelves and Quick-sands of a Wife, That Wak'ner of Despair, and Scourge of Life! 'Twas not because you never saw the Flame; In Crowds of Beauties you were still the same, And, looking back, despis'd the following Game: Thus, flying, you the beauteous Victors beat, And Parthian like, secur'd the Conquest by Retreat: Disarm'd of all their Darts, the Fantoms fled, By your persisting Sense their Pow'r struck dead, And Wit and Friendship govern'd in their stead. Friendship! Heav'ns holiest Tye and Balm of Life! And Wit! that never cou'd consist with Strife. How are we pleas'd at ev'ry Word you speak! How do we glow to see the Lightning break! Inevitable Mirth our Grief controuls, Shines thro' the Sullen Gloom, and warms our Souls! Sadness it self does in thy Presence wear A Pleasing Look, and Poets lose their Care. There's not a Soul can stir while thou dost stay! To ev'ry Mind you Life and Light convey, Just as where e'er the Sun arrives 'tis Day! Why shou'd not Wit, a Blessing so sublime, As it from Love, secure thee too from Time? It will not be!—The Body falls of Course; But thy Immortal Name's above his Force, R. G. A SATYR AGAINST WOOING: With a View of the Ill Consequences that attend it. True Love (if yet there such a thing can be) Is where two Persons mutually agree; And marry next (to root out all Debate) Without a Thought of Portion, or Estate: Then both alike, with cheerful Labour, strive By Honesty and Industry to Live, Alike contented, if they're poor, or thrive. Thus Living Happily and Dying Late, They scarce find Heav'n a more Exalted State. But O! Th'Arabian Phœnix is less rare Than such a happy, such a wond'rous Pair! Not in an Age a Mutual Couple shown; And 'tis as certain that the Fault's our own. We Sigh and Weep, with Hopes and Fears perplex Our selves, and Deify a faithless Sex. As Butchers blow their Veal and taint their Ware, Praise does to Woman what the Breath does there. Scarce has the Foppling Sixteen Summers seen, The Down but Just appearing on his Chin, But he a Tingling in his Blood does find, And thinks he's fit to propagate his Kind; And were that all, he shou'd not have our Blame, Since every other Brute pursues the same: Enjoy'd, at once they lose their Lust and Strife; But he more thoughtless, pushes at a Wife, And thinks Desire will only end with Life. But e'er he can effect his mad Design, And in th'unquiet Clam'rous Union Joyn, The two old Fathers, very gravely, meet T'adjust the Young ones shaking of the Sheet: Th'Hereditary Mannor House and Grounds The Joynture, and in lieu Five thousand Pounds. What's this but just like Tradesmen bart'ring Ware? Or cheating Jockeys in a Smith-field Fair, And even Chop between the Horse and Mare? The Match thus made up, (thoughtless of th'Event,) The Noddy's next to get the Nymph's Consent; In order to't he Powders and Perfumes, And, three long Hours in Dressing spent, presumes At last before the Idol to appear, Bowing, as if the Deity were there: Not more cou'd be the Rapture had she been A bright, and just descended Cherubin. But now the speaking Faculty does seize The Ass, that breaks out smooth in Words like these. Madam—What shall I say? or how impart In Language that may make you feel the Smart, The mighty Anguish of my bleeding Heart? Wounded by You, nor able to endure The raging Pain, I humbly Kneel for Cure. O let thy Looks thy future Love Declare, As bright Aurora does a Day that's Fair. Do not, Ah! do not, in a dismal Cloud Of gloomy Scorn thy Smiling Mercy Shroud! But let those Eyes, that can the Sun Controul, Shine with Enliv'ning Warmth upon my Soul, And an undone, despairing Lover save, Whose utmost Glory is to dye your Slave. O Sot! that knows not Wedlock is a more Incessant Toyl than tugging at the Ore, The Joy of which he Dreams to stand possest A Bed-fellow that ne'er will let him rest; In fatal Kindness draining of his Strength, Or Curtain Lectures, fatal for their Length; Knows all his secret Crimes, his Folly hears, Lessens his Hopes, and does encrease his Fears, And Studies how to Plague him forty Years. Had not a blunt Address been rather fit? And, at that Juncture, better shew'd his Wit? Madam (tho' 'tis a Truth that's something bold) We here are by our Parents bought and sold: Tho' they are Craz'd, pray let not us be Mad, But make the best of what will else be Bad: They've yoak't us, let us go an equal Pace, 'Tis walking Hand in Hand that wins this Race. Tho' yet of Love we may but little know, If after Marriage we can Loving grow, We shall be the first Pair that e'er did so. But to return—the Fop's Oration 'ore (To many a Meaner Drab addrest before) He little thinks what Torment will succeed; That he so soon shall be a Slave indeed: That all the Joys and Innocence of Life Fly their Invet'rate Opposite—a Wife: That Friendship, Wine and Wit, like Truth to Sin, All hurry out as Marriage enters in. Well, but the Lady proud of the Applause, Her Mouth into a squeamish Posture draws, And cries, Ah Sir! y'ave learnt the Courtier's Art To speak fine Words, but distant from your Heart: These Compliments were better said before Some Fairer Object, that cou'd charm you more. O Madam! He Replies, you are unjust, Can you inevitable Charms distrust? With Eyes that Languish and with Conquer'd Hearts We own your Pow'r, your Raptures, Flames and Darts: Charm more than You? O touch not that extreme! What Goddess does her own Divinity Blaspheme? Thus does the Coxcomb entertain the Fair; Who, at the same time, is so pleas'd to hear, That she forgets she is to be a Bride, And loses all her Leach'ry in her Pride. Impossible a Man shou'd keep up to That warm Discourse in which he first did Woo: It can't be always Angel, Love and Dear! Celestial! Orient Eyes! and Matchless Fair! These failing, Wedlock grows a thing accurst; A Wife expects it still as 'twas at first. Here sinks on Florid Fop—And in his Train, To the same Snare, comes on the Rhiming Swain; The Sot that Writes, and is an Ass by Rule, The Cælia, Silvia, Chloris, Phillis Fool: Song is his Meat, his Drink, his Mistress too, For 'tis to shew his Wit that makes him Woo; Tho' there are better Ways that Gift to prove, Than wasting time in Courtship, Noise and Love. No new Collection can of Verse appear, No Farce, no Comedy thro' all the Year, But you'll be sure to meet our Coxcomb there: Proud to his senseless Songs to Print his Name, And thinks his Whining, Love; and Scribling, Fame. This bad, and yet that other Songster's worse, Whose Madrigals flow only from his Purse; So much for Making he at first bestows, For Setting next the second Guinea goes; The singing Master sharps another Spill; Ah! Sir, he gargling cries,—That Note must kill! At Midnight he for Serenade prepares, As if (alike disturbing sickly Ears) He must ring his Chimes when the Bells go theirs. In vain this Cost and Toil; for still 'tis found There's nearer Ways to Wood than going round: Some Brawny Groom, as thus the Fop hums on, Has leave to Mount, and the Love-suit is done. Thus to the Fool the Filly's ready broke, The Clown her Pleasure, and the Fop her Cloak. But granting that there were a Nymph so choice, That lik't her Lover purely for his Voice; Ev'n granting that, 'twill not be very long E'er she'll like Something better than a Song. A Common Singer on the Stage has there Where Voice will do, th'Advantage of a Peer: Or tho', by chance, his Lordship led the Way, What one Fool has possest, all others may. Next to this Wooer, we the Slave may place With the sad watry Eyes, and Rueful Face, That sighs out all his Hours and in the Groves, Carves on the Beeches his unprosp'rous Loves. Sot! only fit to make his Court to Trees, That hopes a Cure, yet tells not his Disease. If she appears he shakes, a Deathlike Pale Sits on his Visage—but the mournful Tale Some Friend, at last, to the lov'd Lady bears, And with the tender Accents wounds her Ears: She Melts and now the Joy he wish't is come; Won without Words, she's born in Triumph home— Happy! if he wou'd still continue Dumb, And pray the Pow'rs to take his Hearing too: And save him from the Clamour to ensue. If by his Cowardice this gets Success, The Bully, you may Judge, expects no less: Mad to enjoy, he ventures Life and Limb, As if the Nymph were only made for him; And Marriage were not binding, just, or good, Unless he cut his Way to it thro' Blood. Thus the first Hour we loving Fops commence, Away goes Christianity and Sense. A Father's Precepts lose their pious Force, For Counsel makes a hardn'd Blockhead worse. Still he fights on, and the most Common Drab He meets with, Courts with Duel and with Stab: So that at last (from Justice fled for fear) His Lot does with this double Choice appear, To starve abroad, or to be truss'd up here. Vain Man! Is this our Boast of being brave? Is this the Prudence above Beasts we have? They tear and gore, and will no Rival bear In Rutting time,—Our Rutt holds all the Year; Condemn'd to Drudge in those unfathom'd Mines, And fonder grow the swifter Life declines. This brings me to the stale gray Fop in Years, That daily at the Park and Play appears, The Scandal and Disgrace of Silver Hairs: The Ladies Hearts with Perfumes t'engage Aping in vain the Youthful Lover's Rage, For Women know too well the Wants of Sapless Age. 'Tis true, some Men t'a Vig'rous Age arrive, But it is then too late to Woo and Wive. Who'd shake the Sands when there's so few to run? And clap on Leeches when the Blood is gone? Yet e'en in Impotence they're still the same, And hold the Cards tho' they can't play the Game; When Nature does in Opposition strive, And the last rak't up Ember's scarce alive. With this weak Wretch we may the lean one join Who (choosing Food that Steels him in the Chine) Feeds for a Mistress like a fatting Swine A Starv'ling just before of Meagre Face, But he crams on and will be brought in Case. Wisely he lays his Fund for Pleasure in, He need not fear the being drain'd again. This Fop of all Fops Ladies most shou'd prize, Light of their Steps, and Jewel of their Eyes! Famous as Spouse that all the Gravy Sips, And like Laborious Bees he lades his Hips; Tho' he that Eats that way t'encrease his Gust, Is but a Limbeck for a Woman's Lust. But what can that Notorious Coxcomb say That, for a Wife, dissolves his Fat away? If he so pank't to strike a heat before, The loss of Spirits will unbreath him more. The first has some Pretence for feeding high; The more this wast, the less he'll satisfy: Or with his Strength shou'd he not lose Desire, Yet Weakness will not do what she'll require. Fool! at her Lover's Corpulence to frown, When she her Self so soon cou'd melt him down, And all the Pleasure of the Change her own. But to please her, tho' he was Horse-man's Weight Full fifteen Stone, he brings himself to Eight; And thinking this Way to get more in Breath, Gets a Consumption first, and next his Death: Happier in that, howe'er, than longest Life, With all his former Garbage and a Wife. But the proud Lover now 'tis time to name, He that beyond his Fortune takes him Aim; Scorns with Two Thousand Pound the Country Girl, And all less than the Daughter of an Earl: There he Addresses, Masks and Balls are made, But finds 'em all too little to perswade. Slighting his Love, and Haughty as she's Fair, What can the Coxcomb do but next Despair? And where that is the Cause, we know th'Effect Is Madness—Pride cou'd never bear Neglect. Hanging, or Poys'ning he does now intend, Nor does indeed deserve a better end. If a rich Consort was so much his Care, Why must she be descended from a P?r? The greatest Fortunes are not met with there: Why rak't he not among the City Heirs? Whence most of our Nobility have theirs; And by the ill got Portions Spend-thrifts made, Down to the same Degree their Line degrade, From Trades-men sprung, and Prentic'd to a Trade. As mad as this is he to Learning Bred, That thinks to gain a Mistress by his Head; When any Block-head sooner shall prevail The Scorns that Aid, and Courts her with his Tail. What need of using all the Liberal Arts, So well receiv'd with our own Natural Parts? The Fools in Verse enough themselves expose, Yet are exceeded by this Fool in Prose. His Love's the very Bird-lime of his Brain, And pulls some Part away with every Strain. Wou'd but my Lady's tawdry Woman show The Billets sh' has receiv'd from Chaplain Beau; (Who, with his fair Wig, and fine Cambrick Band, Thinks all the Ladies are at his Command,) Wou'd she, I say, but deign to let you see This Rhetorician in his Gaiety, In all his Tropes and Figures, and the rest Of those hard Terms in which his Passion's drest; You'd swear a Woman by such Courtship won, Wou'd not deny th'Address of a Baboon, Whose Chatt'ring she wou'd understand as soon. Beyond her knowledge all her Stile does run, And if he wins her he's beyond his own; More dull the deeper in her Books he gets, That study where the wisest lose their Wits. But now comes one who (disregarded here) Flies to the Sea to quench his Passion there; And does expect from the more faithful Main A milder Fate than from her cold Disdain: Farewell, he cries; when of my Death you hear, In kindness let there fall one pitying Tear; My Ghost will then to the Elizian Grove Fly pleas'd, else haunt you for neglected Love; Away he goes; the Winds, the Rocks, the Sand Less cruel thinks than her he left at Land: So far he's well:—but e'er his Travail ends, To Vex her, he his Patrimony spends. In France, or Rome, at last his Heart he frees, His Passion loses, and gets their Disease, The main Commodity of either Nation, Here a False Faith, and there a Salivation. Vain Fool! for such Relief so far to Roam! He might as well have met that Cure at Home: Here Quacks in Surgery and Religion too Abound, which elder Britain never knew; Produc'd in ev'ry Corner of our Isle, As Heat does Monsters from the slime of Nile. Return'd, some second Fair do's now delight; Proud of the Chance, to his old Mistress sight He brings the New, and Marries then in Spight. Exults, and Triumphs in his happy Fate:— —A Wife, the Pox, and not a Groat Estate. This Slave's attended by a Wretch as bad, Who by his Itch of Pleasure is Betray'd: Woo's for Enjoyment only, and Succeeds; (For little Courtship that Intention needs) And, tho' the Mark is what all Coxcombs hit, He from that Minute dates himself a Wit: Glories that he the subtle Bait has took Without the Fate of Hanging on the Hook. Not Dreaming, Ideot, tho' one Danger's o'er, He yet is nearer Ruine than before. For from Enjoyment she has took her Cue, Do's Kneel, and Pray, and Swoon, and Weep and Wooe; Since y'ave the Jewel take the Casket too, She cries, Ah! Can you throw her from your Arms Whose only Crime was yielding to your Charms? So sweet you look't, so Passionately swore, I lost my Breath and could resist no more! If by such Words he's not prevail'd to stay, Again she Kneels, again she Dies away. Thus Night and Day his Privacies she'll haunt, And make him swear anew to every Grant: Plies him so hard he's forc'd at last to Yield, For if he Pities her, he's lost the Field. Whose Drab a Man may Marry is unknown, The fatal Proofs of that are daily shown; But of all Whores I least should wed my own. In this loose Train the Widower to behold, Will scarce obtain Belief when it is told: By his good Fate, and Providence's Care Freed from the Yoke, who wou'd not now beware? Sav'd from a Wrack and safely put on Shore, A thinking Man wou'd trust the Rocks no more. But Mariners, you'll say must go to Sea, And there's for Wedlock more Necessity: Posterity must last, and Bread be had— And can't this be without my being Mad? If Trades-men for the meer Support of Life, Willing to suffer Discontent and Strife, Let (as their Consorts are cut off and Die) Another Hydra's Head the Place supply, What then? Must he that has a large Estate, And Children too that for Advancement wait, Adore and be at the same Amorous Pass As when, at Twenty, he Commenc'd an Ass? Bring a Step-Mother to his Elder Brood (A sort of Creature always Poor and Lewd) And, gratifying her, no Right preserve? Her's have th'Estate, his former Children starve? Whoring is bad, it's Consequences worse, But such a Marriage is the heavier Curse. But these not all, there's yet one Fool t'appear, Strutting like a Lieutenant in the Rear: The witty Fop, I mean that Woo's in jest, Conceives he's safe, and laughs at all the rest: Courts all, and all alike; and who believes, Born to be false, he certainly deceives. No Marriage comes within his lewd Intent, Yet talks as if he only Marriage meant. A Thousand Oaths of Constancy does Swear, And will be ever tampering with the Snare. Playing with Love, but makes the Snake grow warm, And there's a Time we can't avoid the Charm. His Weakness, or Neglect he'll surely show, That always will be parlying with the Foe. Examine all the Annals ever Writ, You'll still find Woman was too hard for Wit. As when on Ship-board (as the Tale does run) The famous Monkey, playing with the Gun, Upon, now under, and now in wou'd go, And this so oft repeated by the Beau, That off went Wisdom, and the Bullet too. Or as a Moth that round the Taper plays, Now here, now there it's Mealy Wings displays, Till bold at length, mistaking Fire for Light, He meets with Ruine where he sought Delight. Just so our crafty Coxcomb round the edge Of Wedlock wantons, till the slippery Sedge Upon the Bank gives way, and lets him in— Laugh! Hymen laugh! And let the Satyr grin! By this time I foresee Objections rise; A thankless Task the bidding Fools be wise, What Man, they'll say, can stand upon his Guard For ever? Such a Watchfulness were hard. Beside 'tis Nature's powerful Call; nor can That Sex be seen without Desire by Man. Not all our Courage, Wisdom, Power, or Art, Can bring Relief where Love has fixt his Dart. Ev'n mighty Jove that cou'd the Lightning tame, Melted himself before this Brighter Flame. Look but on Woman (for w'are bid increase) And what hard Heart wou'd have Coition cease? Angels at first, then Man was form'd by Heaven, And to 'em both Transcendent Graces giv'n: The first Created Pure to wing the Skies, Where Beatifick Visions feed their Eyes. The last, the Lord of this Creation made, With such a Look as all the Creatures aw'd. But in that Sex we Man and Angel find, In one Compendium both their Graces joyn'd, Of human half, half of Celestial kind. In them both Heav'n and Earth at once Unite; Fram'd fit for Love, and molded for Delight! Delights that cannot! Shou'd not be exprest!— O let us pause a while—and wish the rest! Hold! hold I cry! Or else 'tis mortal War, Stretch not your bold Hyperbole's too far: Tho' all in Heav'ns Design at first was good, It must be with Restriction understood. Believe not we'd have Propagation cease, But carry'd on with Innocence and Peace. And Men of Sense exempted from the Rules Of wedding Misery, and begetting Fools. Paul's wishing all like him does make it plain Those Men that please may single Life retain: His Words no other Sense but this can bear, Be free from Woman and y'are free from Care. 'Tis true, we own they were by Nature meant, A Blessing to us, form'd for our Content; Made in Prosperity our Joys to share, And in our Wants to mollify our Care; Not order'd to command us, but obey, And are to follow, not to lead the Way: But we pervert that End, and, born to Rule, Meanly degenerate into Slave and Fool; Wast on their gawdy Trappings all our Store, Then fall down to the Idol and adore. Hence to so vast a pitch her Pride does rise, All that deny her Homage she'll despise: Kind neither to Desert, or Wit, or Wealth; But hugs the Fool where she can see her Self. The Mirrour that returns her Image true, Where, by Reflection, she may have a View Of something always vain, and always new. With empty Sound and outward Gesture won, But bait the Hook with Fool the Work is done. Fool is their Food, their only dear Delight, Their daily longing, and their drudge at Night. The Man of Sense (tho' Marriage he may hate) Wou'd in his Line continue his Estate; Ev'n he too, if he wou'd successful prove, Must Ape the Fool, and seem the thing they Love: Tho' h'has enjoy'd her he must still adore, Tho' Master be as servile as before, Or, chast as Ice, she'll Marry'd turn a Whore. Well then, you'll say, why all this Discontent? You do but rail at what You can't prevent. 'Twas never known but Fools were num'rous still, Wedlock a Snare, and Wives perversly ill. What Remedy can you to Man propose That he may not by Love, or Marriage lose? Cou'd that be done in Vain you wou'd not Write, Nor Envy say 'twas Prejudice and Spite. I answer, If Men will their Vice retain, And, when Convicted, let their Follies Reign; Ev'n Juvenal himself had writ in vain: In vain as far as it relates to them That will not mend, but not in vain to him. For tho' we can't of Reformation boast Our well meant Labours are not wholly lost, Virtue rewards its self; and he that wou'd Convert the Vitious, then confirms the Good. But to come closer to you:—Wou'd we use That Aid we have, and not our Wills abuse, A Thousand ready Helps before us stand, Which the most Stupid Idiot might command. What Man is there that can't forbear to Cringe? And hang his Hope upon that slender Hinge? Who need protest a painted Drab's Divine, When she is daub'd more coursly than a Sign? Who need at Womens Scorn or Coldness pine, That may relieve himself with Friends and Wine. Who'd tear and rave, and think his Fortune ill Because one won't, when there's so many will? Why are Rich Presents squander'd every Day? W' are not oblig'd to throw Estates away. Why Swearing? And of Lyes a num'rous Rout? Vertue wou'd think as well of us without. Superiour we; suppose we equal were, Why all that Adoration? Standing bare? Watching their Eyes? And placing (to our Cost) That Heav'n in them by whom our Heav'n was lost? May not all these, and num'rous Follies more (Too shameful here to mention) be forbore? Convicted thus, ev'n you must give your Voice, That all our Coxcombs Miseries are his Choice. Then the Adventurer who wou'd happy be In Wedlock, must Precepts learn of me. First, where he likes he must for Marriage sue, Be true himself, and always think her so. No Jealousy of Rivals must appear, For she'll be false if you her falshood fear. Nor while you Woo be still protesting Love; Large Promisers the worst Performers prove. Then after Wedlock, ne'er be heard contend, Happy! If you can make your Wife your Friend! Devour her not at once; but so enjoy As not to feed too sparingly, or Cloy. By dext'rous Management, you still must shew Her Good results from her Delight in you. Give her full Freedom; too severe Restraint Estranges Love, and makes Affection faint. Let her wear what she will; your Happiness Lies in your being easy, not her Dress. No Sullenness must in your Looks be worn, And all her Pets must patiently be born, For y'are her Cuckold if y'are once her Scorn. If all this keeps her not to Vertue fast, Conclude no Woman ever yet was Chast: But if this Usage does her Soul endline To Truth, she's Happy, and her Joy is thine, And only so the Marriage Knot's Divine: For as it stands among the Vulgar Fry Or Gentry either, where there's Jealousy, Jack Ketch's Noose is far the Holier Tye. All this is hard, You'l cry, extreamly hard! And if such Doctrine met the Worlds regard, The Trade of Licenses wou'd soon be marr'd. 'Tis what one of Ten Thousand ne'er cou'd do. —Faith, Sir, I am of your Opinion too. 'Tis therefore I'm so earnest with the Men, Before they Noose to think—and think agen. If with a Wife he Happiness wou'd see, Just such a Creature must a Husband be: Nay often too with all this Kindness shewn, His Heir shall be her Bantling, not his own. Thus, Sir, I've freely answer'd your Request, Marry, or Marry not, as like's you best. But now 'tis time some Counsel to bestow Upon Sir Passionate, the Am'rous Beau, That he at need may scape a scowring too. If in his Breast he finds the Poison strong, H'has then this Comfort, 'twill not Rack him long; The warmer Love the sooner 'twill be cold, For no extreme in Nature long can hold. But if the Venom yet more dang'rous prove, Take what I here prescribe—and laugh at Love. First set before your Eyes as fair a Piece As ever Ancient Rome produc'd, or Greece; Brighter than Hellen that set Troy on Fire, And chast as Infants that ne'er knew desire: That Icy Vertue keeps the Lover warm, (For nothing that's Immodest long can Charm) Strip but this Puppet of it's Gay Attire, It's—Gauzes, Ribbons, Lace, Commode and Wire, And tell me then what 'tis thou dost admire? First 'tis her pretty Shooe that so prevails; The charm can ne'er lie in her Toes and Nails. Her Leg, long, little, wretchedly compos'd, Shall hinder what is worse to be disclos'd, Only her Breasts there is no passing by, Because made bare to Court th'admiring Eye: These, when they Lace, up to their Chins they Buoy, And in short Heavings artfully employ: There they look well; but when the Night is come They're down agen just even with the Bum. Next, let her nat'ral Set of Teeth be shown, If she's not Thirty, for she then has none; With eating Sweet-meats rotted from the Gum; So that her Breath is not the best Perfume. Her Face, indeed, we own were wond'rous fair, If there a Head belong'd to't that had Hair. Upon old Time you may a Forelock find, But theirs are false, or brought round from behind. Thus Woman, tho' by Fools and Flatt'rers Fam'd Let her Defects from Head to Foot be nam'd, Is the most vain unfinish't Piece that Nature ever Fram'd. This nice Inspection of her Person done, Let all her little Implements be shown: Open her secret Boxes; Patches here You'll horded find, her Paints and Washes there: Loves artful Lime twigs, where the chatt'ring Ape Sits Perch'd, and han't the Judgment to Escape; Pleas'd with his Station there the Buzzard sings, But finds his Shackles when he'd use his Wings, If in her Bed you e'er perceive her fast, Mind how her Face is crusted o'er with Past, Or nasty Oils us'd nightly to repair Her Skin, quite spoil'd—with taking of the Air. The scatter'd Pieces of her artful Frame (More than wou'd take up a whole Day to Name) Lie strew'd around, and such a Prospect yield As Spoils when Routed Armies leave the Field, Hip-Cushions, Plumpers, Massy Pads for Stays— And thousand other Things, dispers'd a thousand Ways. So that the Fair (like Bone-lace when 'tis wrought) Can't altogether in one Piece be brought, (Her Foils in Order, and Her Am'rous Gins) Without five Hundred Pounds a Year in Pins. A thoughtful Creature must conclude from hence The best of 'em not worth that vast Expence; That the short Snatches of Delight we court We pay so dear for, that it Palls the Sport. Then what a Perfume where she comes is lent? All over Strew'd to hide Her Nat'ral Scent. So they that Stink of Onions, if they eat Garlick 'twill make the fainter Smell retreat; But then a stronger Stench supplies the Room: And so she cures Her Rankness by Perfume. Thus Wooing diff'rent we from Hunting find, For there w'are pleas'd when Puss is in the Wind. If o'er the Fop his Passion yet prevails, And He'll weigh Reason only in His Scales, Neither to be perswaded, forc'd, or Sham'd, But proud of Bondage, scorns to be reclaim'd, Let Him Wooe on;—A little time will shew He is an Ass, and all our Doctrine true. THE STEP-MOTHER, A SATYR: Written to a Disinherited Son. TO My Reverend Friend Mr. ? Of all the Crimes with which the fairer Sex Their Selves and us (their Better selves) perplex, There's none deserve a Treatment so Severe As those that fall to a Step-Mother's Share: There's not a Devil damn'd but may as soon Hope for Salvation—as we'll shew anon. The Strumpet who by Prostitution lives, And in that Court, but curs'd, Vocation thrives, All Arts must try, and all her Snares must lay, With Pleasures soften, and with Smiles betray; Now chill her Lover with a forc'd disdain, And when he can no longer bear the Pain Look pleas'd, and warm Him into Lust again: While He, by choice, dissolving in her Arms, Has not a Wish, or Hope beyond her Charms. The Bawd, 'tis true, of Subt'ler Venom's made, A Devil in her Diligence and Trade: Both Men and Women She at once ensnares, And the more Beaute'ous, there the least She spares. In vain the Fair a Vertu'ous Life designs, Her best Defences soon She undermines: By what themselves did in their Youth require, They know the Secret Springs that move Desire, And make the Tinder fit to catch the Fire. Secure of them, they next the Coxcomb ply, And Swear they've brought him a Virginity: So to the next; and so to ev'ry one, Till not a Fop has miss'd it thro' the Town. But what are all this Beldams specious Wiles, Or yet th'Alluring Harlot's Frowns and Smiles To Vertue well Resolv'd?—with the strong Arms Of Chastity we break thro' all their Charms; Where that Presides, and Honour holds the Rein, Lust has no Force, and Pleasure courts in vain. Thus far w' are safe; at least 'tis in our Pow'r, If we will tread this Path, to walk Secure. But Ah! What Vertue, Wisdom, Valour, Wit, Or ought Mankind cou'd ever boast of yet, Can keep us, with their utmost Caution, free From a Step-Mother's watchful Cruelty? When Envy meditates a Secret throw, And whence it comes we neither see nor know, It is Impossible to ward the Blow. Unknown the Cause, we find the Root is dry That shou'd with Sap our Vital growth supply: We look like Leaves that are at Autumn seen, And she like Bays and Lawrel, ever Green. In her old Dotard's feeble Arms she lies, And kindly with his Impotence complies; And when his Vigor's ready to expire, Molds his cold Clay, and warms it to Desire, And blows the Ember's till she find the Fire; At once his Body and his Coffer drains, And leaves his Purse as empty as his Veins. Yet still she flatters, fondles and attends, But shifts the Scene when she has gain'd her Ends: His former Children then we treated find As if they were the Monsters of their Kind: Their Fau'ts, if Mole-Hills, are as Mountains rais'd, And all their Vertues down to Vice debas'd; His ever blam'd, and Hers for ever Prais'd. He hears, believes;—and, last, on Her and Hers Does Settle all; deprives his former Heirs Of his Estate, his Blessing, and his Prayers. Why shou'd long Life so many Myriad's please, If Age betray us to such Crimes as these? 'Twere better far we with the First had dy'd, Than with a Second Wife remove so wide As to admit Injustice for a Guide. How can we boast of being Good or Wise (Unless, like Women, we are all Disguise) When we are Agents in our own Deceit, And palm upon our Selves so gross a Cheat? Forget the Ties of Wedlock, Virtue, Blood, To make a Drab delight in being Lewd? For of Step-Mothers we ev'n Proof might bring, That, tho' a Wife's the Name, a Jilt's the Thing. But least this Truth Extravagant appear, (For Truth we grant may often be Severe,) Have Patience, while we faithfully describe The vilest, and most frontless of her Tribe: Th'Occasion's fair, the Tragedy is True, And, what may make it take the more, 'tis New. Damon, of Gener'ous Parts, was Marry'd Young: And in Aminta's Arms was happy long: With her Large Dowry She increas'd his Store; Happy in that, but in her Vertues more. Ne'er had a Creature of the Charming Race More Truth and Sweetness writ upon her Face. The Fortune which she brought advanc'd so fast, Like Midas, all he touch'd was Gold at last: And that which was but a Genteel, of late, Is now a noble and a vast Estate. On Her Foundation was the Fabrick built, Of Thousands not a Farthing got with Guilt. But Fate's uncertain;—who cou'd ever yet Enjoy below a Happiness compleat? For now Aminta chang'd her Earthly State, Torn from his Arms by a Relentless Fate. One Weeping, only Son She left behind, With all her Goodness stampt upon his Mind, Whom, e'er She dy'd, into her Arms She took, And thus bespoke her Damon with a dying Look. Tho' of my Life You'll be this Hour bereft; This Pledge of my unspoted Love is left; As He's Your own I know you'll Tender be; Be not less so when You Remember me. If dying Words have any Power to move, If there be Force in Tears, or Charms in Love, I here adjure You, by our former Joy, Be kind to this now half-forsaken Boy; Th'Estate which Heav'n so freely to us gave, Don't to another Woman's Children leave. Nor let his Fau'ts, when He's to Manhood grown, (For who was e'er so Vertu'ous to have none?) Make You forget He is Aminta's Son! A Burst of Grief Seiz'd Damon here all o'er; O Doubt me not, He cry'd,—And cou'd no more! In Tears he granted what the Dame requir'd, While in his Arms the best of Wives expir'd. But Silence will declare his Sorrow best, For 'twas so Great it cannot be exprest. In vain he beat his Breast, and tore his Hair, And call'd on Her that was no more to hear! Ah! why must Vertue make so short a Stay? And for so long a Space be snatcht away? Eternal Darkness! And a Moment's Day! But where's that Beauty so Divinely Bright, Who, if She's took for ever from our Sight, Leaves when She's gone, imprinted on the Mind, So fair an Image of her Self behind, That to her Memory we confine our View, And not look out for Objects that are new? A Second Choice in Love w'are not refus'd; That Liberty e'en Wisest Men have us'd; And so far Damon justly stands excus'd. But when to fill her Place he had before, He took a Creature Idle, Proud and Poor, Lascivious, so by Consequence a Whore; One that had neither Beauty, Wit, or Youth, Good Humour, Breeding, Piety, or Truth; But from the Station rais'd of Wiping Shooes, To be Successor to so chast a Spouse; The World may well with it's severest Voice, As justly tax the Error of the Choice. Sure there's a Time when all our Vertues keep A Rest, just as the Body does in Sleep; When the Neglected Pass unguarded lies, And one weak Vice does their whole Strength Surprize: So Damon must be taken, unprepar'd, When not one Caution stood upon his Guard. Had He but us'd his Hearing, Scent, or Sight, He'd not have made a Monster his Delight, That never Man beside beheld without a Fright; A Vain, Perverse, Invete'rate Noisy Thing, And not a Drop of Hony with her Sting. A while with Art her Nature She conceal'd, Nor was it till She had a Son Reveal'd; A Son not gotten with a Lover's Rage, But piec'd together with the Dregs of Age: Or rather, as by all 'tis likelier thought, By some rude Clown with too much hast begot; Whom she (which was enough to Spoil the Boy) Did in her Fears of being found Employ, And snatch'd a crude, and half abortive Joy: The Issue, like the Sport, (where half was wast,) Does look as it were molded up in hast: A Peevish Rittl'ing with a Thousand Ails, As still 'tis where the Mother's part prevails. Here Damon did afresh his Weakness shew, And as he older yet the fonder grew; And was at last so fatally deceiv'd, Tho' Hell was scarce so false, not Heav'n was more believ'd. Here she was safe, her Reign she dated hence; (The Favorites Reign is fatal to the Prince:) And first her Son in Law must be remov'd, Absent, She thought He wou'd be less belov'd: But tho' abroad with fair Pretences sent, It might be rather call'd his Banishment. For now no longer She consulted Fear, The Way to her Design did Smooth appear, Which was to put him by from being Heir. In order to't the Father's Ears She plies, And loads the Youth with odious Calumnies, One Truth attended with Ten Thousand Lyes; Worse than the Devil, her Instructer meant, And all but what a Woman cou'd invent. Yet She wou'd Weep her Scandals to relate Revile her Fortune, and exclaim at Fate That forc't her such flagitious Truths to tell Of One, whom she so lately lov'd so well; Those Truths which He shou'd long before have known, Had the offending Villain been her Own. Absent alas! How cou'd he make Defence? Or Present, what had been his Innocence Before an Angry Judge? A Witness by, A Lady of the Post, to vouch the Lye, And One whose smallest Crime was Perjury. Wretch'd is He that does too soon believe, But more accurs'd who does that Wretch deceive; The Serpent was more Criminal than Eve, And She than Adam; (Skillful in the Art, How soon she learn'd to Act a Devil's Part!) He, with his Rib, had stood, and Damon too, But for his Wife, had kept the Goal in view, Nor to that Utmost Bound of Rigour run Of Casting out so Dutiful a Son. But as when a Young Criminal is took In his first Fau't, and having in his Look Some small Remains of Innocence behind, He moves the Judge, and makes the Jury kind; Who, hoping he may Mend, his Pardon Seal; But his Seducer does their Fury feel: So Mercy to the Tempted may be shown, But Tempters, who are Devils, can have none. Thus won at last as Samson was of old, (But by an Uglier Jilt, and louder Scold;) Or rather quite bewitcht, and given up To tast the Bottom of that Bitter Cup, Forgets the Chast Aminta's dying Prayer And makes the Bantling of this Drab his Heir! The Soul of his Departed Spouse look'd down On the Rash Deed, and scarce forbore to frown; Wonder'd how Vows, design'd when they were spoke To last so long, cou'd be so quickly broke! But more, a Vitious Woman shou'd have Pow'r The Harvest of her Labours to Devour, And blast the Groth of Ages in an Hour.— But tho' his Fau't did thus her Mind employ It yet was no Abatement to her Joy; For if depriv'd but of a Moments Rest, How can the Saints Eternally be blest? Thus, all Serene, she let this Language fall, Soft as the Down of Doves, without a Gall. 'Tis no Surprize, since Man is made so frail, That Int'rest, Passion, Pride and Lust prevail. But if, cry'd she, as Sacred Writ does tell, The Wisest, Strongest, and the Best have fell, Weakly by fatal Female Charms ensnar'd, Some took by Force, and others unprepar'd, And some that Strictly stood upon their Guard; And if we rather Pity these than blame, Then Charity for Damon pleads the same. Beside, tho' all Men fall into Offence, All Men may rise again by Penitence. Then since thy Death, O Damon! I fore-see, (For here our Eyes are clear'd, to view Futuritie;) Heav'n give thee Grace thy Follies past to mourn, And see the Wrongs my wretched Son has born; O do not lightly such a Crime Survey, But wash in Streams of Tears your Guilt away! That when you from her faithless Arms disjoyn, You hither may to Extasies Divine Ascend, and be once more—and ever—Mine! Thus Spoke the Shade; a Lambent Brightness round Her Temples play'd, with Wreaths of Glory bound. Purg'd from the Dross of a Terrestrial Mind, The Blest are all Propitious to Mankind: Who knows but that our near Relations here, Advanc'd, may be our Guardian-Angels there? And tho' we don't their Mediation need, (A Greater having to Himself decreed That Work for Sinful Man to Intercede;) No doubt they pray all Blessings Earth can share We here may have; and, last,—a Crown of Glory there. But Damon's fatal Hour is now arriv'd; Too kind, alas! to be much longer liv'd. To a Step-Mother nothing seems unjust That does advance her Pride, Revenge, or Lust: Her End obtain'd, She fears he may Repent, And takes a black Resolve up to Prevent. Just so, 'tis thought, a Factious Crew, e'er while, Did serve a Gracious Monarch of an Isle; First to preserve 'em, begg'd Him to comply, And when h'ad set 'em up, they laid him by. But tho' she thought his Hour of Grace was past This great Deceiver was Deceiv'd at last: For something Heav'nly purg'd his Blinded Eyes, And then He saw Her Love was all Disguise; He saw her Will was Vain, her Mind Unjust, Her Idol, Interest, and her Fondness, Lust. But Frontless, now, as well as Indiscreet, She took no care to hide her Cloven-Feet; The Fiend appear'd; and 'twas discover'd plain Her Joy was heightn'd by her Husband's Pain. He Saw, but 'twas too Late; his Will was made, And on his Death-bed he securely laid: Her Instruments were all Officious round; But not a Friend of his Admittance found, To whom he might his Dying Mind declare, Or call for Mercy in a Mutual Prayer. Yet, e'er his Lab'ring Heart was wholly broke, He thus the Monster of her Kind bespoke. Too late, alass! I find my self deceiv'd, And at my Dying Hour of PEACE bereav'd; A Wife's an ANGEL till she is Believ'd; Grant but that Point, th'Ascendant soon she gains, And bloody as a GALLICK Tyrant Reigns: No thought of Right does e'er her Mind possess, But hardens more, the more she's us'd with Tenderness. Compare our Faults, Excessive Love was Mine; The last degree of Bosom-Treach'ry, Thine. Thy Son's Advance, design'd by Worthy Ways, Instead of my Rebuke, had met my Praise: I for thy Issue cou'd have nobly done, Without my DISINHERITING my Own. But think not, Barb'rous Woman, Heav'n will still Assert Your Cause, and Prosper You in Ill: Think not th'Estate (for Veng'ance is Divine) Will long Continue in Your Bastard Line; For ev'n I, Dying, think it none of Mine: No, no; my dear AMINTA's out-cast Son Will one Day come to repossess his Own; There's but a Breath betwixt, e'er He is Due May come to gain, and thou this Usage rue:— But I forgive Thee—Heav'n forgive Thee too! He ended here—a Scene to be admir'd— She Laught, and He (all Penitence) expir'd. Thus did the Punk expel the Lawful Heir; And yet her Boundless Malice Stops not there: His Fame she hourly Labours to expose Whom e'er she talks with, or where e'er she goes: Pursues him with that Rancour, Rage and Spite, A Basilisk does Poison less with Sight, And Adders don't with half that Venom bite: To paint Her in a Word, and shew her whole, She Thro' his Body strives to Stab his Soul: And all for fear He shou'd th'Estate attain, And she be forc'd of Fortune to complain, Not that She's Damn'd—but that She's Damn'd in Vain. Mean while the Youth has ever, undismay'd, A Noble Use of his Afflictions made; And does his Wrongs so slenderly regard, He only smiling says—His Case is hard. Thus far, O Friend, th'Injunction late You laid Is with Exactest Probity obey'd: I told You what a Barb'rous Wretch I knew How from the Dung, She like a Pumpkin grew, And your Command was Strait to let her know How far the Satyr's Privilege cou'd go, To rip her Mind, and all her Vices show: And one's enough; the Nature of the rest May from the Wickedness of this be guess'd. But while this Youth's Misfortunes here are shown You by Reflection may perceive Your Own: Your Story is the Parallel of this; And the two Female Furies of a Piece: Take then his Course; and tho' a vast Estate Y'ave lost like Him, Submit like Him to Fate. Rage is but vain, and needless Grief a Crime; Who knows what's Rip'ning in the Womb of Time? Tho' Heav'n may long seem to with-hold his Hand, 'Tis but to hurl with greater Force the Brand; Then down the Flaming Precipice they'll go, Ten Thousand Terrors He'll around 'em throw, And not one Devil will be Damn'd so low. A Glance at Fanaticism; A SATYR. TO The Right Honourable JAMES Earl of ABINGDON, &amp;c. Lord Lieutenant of the County of Oxford. There is in every one of these Considerations most just Cause to fear, least our Hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous Consequence shou'd cause Posterity to feel those Evils, which as yet are more easy for us to Prevent, than they wou'd be for them to Remedy. Pref. to Hooker's Eccle. Pol. Speaking of the Presbyterian Discipline. Happy the Times when Man Rejoyc'd to pay All just Obedience to the Regal Sway: Then 'twas thro' Vanquish'd France our Triumphs flew, Arms our Delight, our Usage to subdue: Then 'twas we humbl'd the high Pride of Spain, And sunk it to the Bottom of the Main. Nor stop'd our Britons here; but, with the Sun, Round the vast Circuit of the Globe have run, And came Home cover'd with the Lawrels won. But Ah! What are we now become? A Den Of Murd'rers, Monsters, and Perfidious Men! What Vict'ries now dost thou, O Albion, win? As once in Arms so now y'are chief in Sin, Hiss'd at without, and Damn'd to Strife within. What Beast so fierce but at the Lion's roar Becomes as tame, as he was wild before? Contended to Obey; but Man alone, Cruel and Faithless, will no Homage own, But in Contempt of it their Kings dethrone; Tho' they well know (for Scripture makes it clear) They stab at GOD in his Vicegerents here. The Impious Jews that never stopt at Ills, But trac'd the Bent of their unbounded Wills, Tho' one perhaps, drunk with Ambitious Rage, (Whose horrid Thirst Blood only cou'd asswage) All Ties of Faith and Nature might disown, And on th'Anointed Blood erect his Throne; I never read the Factious Chiefs did join, Associated in one Damn'd Design; Or that they were such vain Fantastick Things T'Imagin, Heav'n design'd 'em all for Kings; As our Flagitions Rebels did of late; When they at once o'erwhelm'd the Church and State, And made three Nations groan beneath the Weight; Brought down their God-like Soveraign to the Block, And then Proclaim'd 'twas Justice gave th'Inveterate Stroke! But tell me Feinds, ye Hell-Instructed Crew, (If Hell can Teach what 'twou'd have blush'd to do) O tell me! Where's the Fame that does Succeed That ever to be mourn'd, and Impious Deed! Or was it done because it was your Will? That Reason which with you makes Nothing Ill; O curs'd Effect of Arbitrary Zeal! I know You'll say 'twas Your Design to be From hateful Slavery and Oppression free: But soon, by a Prepost'rous search, 'twas found You lost the Substance, while You fear'd the Sound: For when thro' all Your Treach'rous Paths y'ad ran, Averse to all the Laws of God and Man, Had you at last, with all the Strifes You wrought, The ease, the Rest, and Liberty you sought? Indeed 'twere most Absurd to think You shou'd; The Way to Peace lies not thro' War and Blood. No, no; that Mob-Asserter of Your Own, That Dunghill You'd have lifted to the Throne, That Idol which with Your own Hands You'd made, And then with so much Frantick Zeal obey'd, Did all Your Rights and Properties invade; Those Properties You had so long enjoy'd, And cou'd not be but by Your Leave destroy'd; Those Rights which with an inexhausted Spring, For ever flow'd from your Indulgent King. Nay the base Sanhedrim, whose Lawless Pride Had to their Prince his Regal Dues deny'd, With open Hands the Tyrant's Lust supply'd, Who their Proud Stores t'as low an Ebb did bring, As they flow'd high when they deny'd their King. So far we of our Senates may presume Subversion still will be the Nations Doom When e'er they Grant too much, or else too much assume: The Balance never can be at a Poize When Kings Oppress, or Crowds are wrought to Noise: Curst be the Wretch that does for Gain, or Spite, Depress, or Raise the Beam, when he may hold it Right. By such a Crew He did the War Commence, And made 'em Wretched at their own Expence. A Just Reward for shedding Civil Gore, A fond, Imagin'd Freedom to Restore, When they had all their Hearts cou'd wish before. But Lo! The Scene begins to shift! And Lo! His God's, his Prince's, and his Country's Foe, Whose Treach'ry and whose Guile had flourish'd long, And been the Theme of many a Laureat's Song, Has in his height of Grandeur met his Doom, Prest with Three Kingdoms Curses to the Tomb; Which cou'd not long such Villany Contain, But from it's Entrals Spew'd Him back again. Thus He, who, while He liv'd, no Freedom gave, Had not, in Death, the Freedom of a Slave, The slender Pittance of a Six-Foot-Grave. Let not the Secta'rist urge he pass'd away In Peace, for where there's Guilt no Peace can stay: 'Twas Heav'ns forbearance so much Time was lent, To try Him first, and warn Him to Repent, And next to shew the World He dyd'd Impenitent. To all Conspic'ous in the Air he hung, Like Haman the Reproach of Every Tongue. Ravens, and all th'Insatiate Fowls of Prey, That us'd to hover round where Carrion lay, Croak't at the Tyrant, Croak't, and flew away. And now of all his Noisy Pomp and Fame, Nothing Survives but a Flagitious Name. Thus Traitors, tho' they may a while shine bright, Like Meteors, at a Blaze lose all their Light, Then Sink to Horrors down, and Everlasting Night. And now, methinks, I see the Sun appear, Nor is it only Thought; for Lo! He's here! With Gentle Beams he first restores the Day, Then drives at once th'Unwholsome Damps away. Ah! Welcome Sacred Sir! Welcome as Sight To those, who from their Births have groap'd in Night, And never hop'd to see Heav'ns Cheerful Light. Welcome as Spring after a Bitter Frost! Welcome as Peace, where Peace has long been lost! What shall I say? O what Eternal Spring Can furnish Words, or set my Thoughts on wing To bless his Welcome, and his Praises Sing? In vain, my Muse, that Lofty Pitch you'd fly, Not practis'd yet to range along the Sky. Now 'twas Offenders to the Covert run, And blusht at all the Impious Deeds they'd done; But Deeds of Darkness dare not view the Sun: Too well they knew the Mischiefs they had wrought Were Unreveng'd, and trembl'd at the Thought, As fearing (what indeed the Bad might fear) The Vengeance due to Treach'ry now was near: But He, like Heav'n, at our Grand Parents Fall, Gave 'em an Act of Grace, and Cancell'd all: An Act that Reason's at a Loss to Scan, And proves the Giver something more than Man! Whose Goodness we in vain would Recommend, For he Forgives as fast as we Offend. O fatal Kindness! And O squander'd Grace! Why so much Mercy on a Sect so base, That ev'n revile his Bounty to his Face? Say then, Ye bold Fanaticks of the Times, You that succeed your Fathers in their Crimes, And learn the Art of Cursing Kings betimes; What makes you thus Seditiously complain, And loath the Blessings of a Peaceful Reign? What you wou'd have we know not—But we know You might be Happy—If you wou'd be so. Has not your God (if any God you own, But I'm afraid you rather think there's none: For Heav'n from whence the best Instruction springs, Enjoins a strict Obedience to our Kings:) Has He not sav'd from Rebels Impious Steel, And the worse Fury of Misguided Zeal, This Gracious Prince, and bless'd us with his Reign; In whom his Martyr'd Father seems to Live again? A Prince who has thro' all Misfortunes trod, With the Unshaken Patience of a God: Not He who liv'd ev'n to his Maker's Heart, Had more of Trouble, and with less Desert. Traduc'd both in a Brother and a Wife, With open Rage pursu'd, and secret Trains for Life. And as the Ancients tell how, heretofore, Atlas all Heav'n upon his Shoulders bore, So He; a Theme for like Immortal Songs, At once sustains a World—A World of Wrongs: Yet still Forgives, and Governs still in Peace, And still the Arts, and still your Gains Increase; The last too much; aud that, 'tis fear'd, the thing That makes thee, London, murmur at thy King; And hold thy Proud Luxurious Head, as high As it once Low did in its Ashes lie: When Heav'n whose Will had been so long withstood, With Plague and Fire reveng'd the Martyr's Blood. 'Tis that inspires thy Crowds with Factious Rage, The Crowd! Whose Fury nothing can asswage, Nor Tears of Youth, nor Eloquence of Age: It rowls o'er all with an impetuous Sway, Like Rivers when they've forc'd their Banks away: The Crowd! That does for ever look awry On those Good Men Desert has mounted high, And have an Inborn Hate to Monarchy: And such a Crowd art Thou; A Mass combin'd Of all Adulterate Mixtures we can find That Poisons Loyalty and warps the Mind: No Wonder then, with such a Race o'erspread The Members shou'd Rebell against the Head. Those Loyal Men that lodge within thy Wall, (For some there are (tho' the Account is small) Some few that never bow'd the Knee to Baal,) Like Wounded Deer were from the rest Cashier'd, Or bore the Brunt of all the Brutal Herd: Witness, for Proof, th'Unparallell'd Abuse (Beyond Example, and beyond Excuse!) To your late Chief; which only hence cou'd Spring, The Man was Honest, and he Lov'd his King: And O for ever may he be belov'd, By Albion Honour'd, and by Heav'n approv'd! Whose Vertues are a Theme for Pens Divine! And then how far above the Reach of Mine! Not Envy can it Self this Truth deny, That (tho' by Birth and State advanc'd so high) More Pride in Your Humility is shown, Than is in all his Grandeur on a Throne. Mark how e'en from the Royal Diadem His Love descends, the Love which You condemn, To make You sensible of Yours to Him. Look thro' Your Thankless Faction far and wide, What have they ask't Him for He e'er deny'd? Unless it were (Invincible Constraint!) What Nature, Law and Conscience cou'd not Grant: And yet ev'n then (with Anguish in his Eye) He griev'd that Heav'n forbid Him to comply: His Brother, too, whom Your Inveterate Hate Brands with the Name of Traytor to the State, But falsly;—Not more False was He that made Perj'ry, that God-less Crime, a Gainful Trade; That Oath-Monopolist, who quite engrost Th'Employ himself, while Temple Nights, at most, Were then but Interlopers of the Post: So false! Ev'n You your Selves cou'd not deny But that your Conscience gave your Tongues the Lye: For why shou'd He Conspire against a Throne That Legally may come to be his Own?— No, that's a Work for Him that's born to none. Has not that Prince our Glory made his Care? And born with Patience all that Man can bear? Who, tho' your Envy does his Fame pursue, He still has Fought both for Your Rights and You. In Foreign Lands his Conduct He has shown, And found no Valour Braver than his Own; Conquest his daily Prize:—and as Success Crown'd Him at Land, 'twas on the Sea no less: Where on the Deck, for his Dear Countries Good Whose Cause He Fought, He has undaunted stood Amidst the Wildest Rage of Canon's Roar, Whose Sound has frighted Cowards on the Shore. One wou'd have thought, who from afar had seen, They in the Bosom of the Clouds had been, And round their Heads Light'ning and Thunder flew, And thro' the Air Ten Thousand Terrors threw: The Sun himself look't Pale, amaz'd to see Deaths winged Darts as thick as Atoms flee; And Nature was Concern'd as well as He. Not so our Hero; who did still appear Fierce as a Storm, and was himself a War. O who in such a Cause wou'd Danger shun, Blest with so brave a Chief to lead 'em on! Who scorn'd to check his Rage, or leave the Fray, Till he had drove their Shatter'd Fleet away; Too wise to trust th'Event of such another Day: But having Wasted half their Strength in Fight, Wing'd by their Cowardice, and Screen'd by Night, Thought best to save the other half by Flight. Thus He, sole Victor, did our Fame regain, And rode without a Rival o'er the Conquer'd Main. Enrich'd by Princes so profusely Good, As near Ally'd in Clemency, as Blood, What Frenzy is it makes You think y'are Poor? And dream of Want amid'st so vast a Store? But as when some Wild Rav'nous Beast of Prey Has seiz'd a Lamb which in his Passage lay, The Blood's first Suck't; and finding that so Sweet, He crams his Maw with the Delicious Meat: Yet the same Moment, painted with the Gore, Rouzes again, and roams the Woods for more, So You, flesh'd with your former Royal Bait, Grow mad, and for another Banquet wait, In the Subversion of the Regal State. From whence else can our wild Divisions Spring But scorn of Truth, and hatred to your King? Is He your Foe that does your Battels Fight, And make the Publick Good his chief Delight? Can it be just, if his Estate shou'd fall, To Seize it, and bestow on M?h all His Right? His Scepter, Diadem, and Ball? What British Soul that has the least Pretence To Vertue, Honour, Loyalty and Sense, Will leave the true to serve a Spurious Prince? The Ancient Heathens, rather than have none, Wou'd hew their Deities from Wood and Stone: Dagon, before he took his Fatal Fall, By his own Votaries was thought Lord of All: To Him in their Distress for aid they'd fly: But Israel's only God was hatefull in their Eye. But Heav'n forbid we shou'd their Steps pursue, Or, to Adore the False, Blaspheme the True: Whose Laws, tho' Spurn'd at by Fanatick Spite, Instruct us to Distinguish Wrong from Right: Right, when we all the True Succession own, Wrong, when the Rabble's Patriot mounts the Throne: Right, when our Gracious Monarch we obey, Whose Care is as Extensive as his Sway; But Wrong against such Goodness to declaim, And with base Libels strive to Wound his Fame; Which You in Vain wou'd Blast with Envious Rage, For that shall ever live to shame th'ingrateful Age. But after all, what can the meaning be Of Bellowing after Rights and Liberty, When there's on Earth no Nation, else so free? Of all the Lands by which Y'are compass'd round, Point me out one with half your Freedoms crown'd. Compare our happy State with France, or Spain's; Here Tyranny, and there the Inquisition reigns. With their Free States compare, we Win again; France but one Tyrant has, and there perhaps they've Ten. 'Tis only here where Property can thrive, Cherish'd and Guarded by Prerogative. The Young in Wantonness the World may Roam: But can they find more Blessings than they taste at Home? The Old and Studious may enjoy their ease, And this may Plough the Land and that the Seas; Ev'n Crowds too may almost do what they please: But Ah! Destructive was that rash Design That gave 'em Liberty in Things Divine; To choose their Worship, (their own Judges made,) As Folly, Fancy, or as Interest Sway'd; Or, when they thought those did not Guide 'em Right, To take a Faith in Prejudice and Spite. O Management! ev'n yet to be deplor'd! The Harbinger of Murder, Fire and Sword! Who does not know it Caus'd us heretofore One Civil War?—and will produce us more. For when the Conscience it's own Way may go, How Boundless, Wild a Monster do's it grow! Pulpits are dwindl'd into Tubs, and Kings Themselves esteem'd Unnecessary Things. All wholsom Doctrin's banish'd with the Creed, And Blockheads Preach that never learn'd to Read. When e'er the State-Artificer wou'd have The People Rulers, and the Prince a Slave, Let Toleration to the Crowd be shewn, And then the Enthusiast Teachers Loo 'em on, Confusion Triumphs, and the Work is done: A Course of many Ages it must be Before that State again knows Peace and Unitie. In vain all healing Remedies are try'd, The more we Labour, they the more Divide:— 'Tis best then when such Liberty's deny'd. Does not your Land with Milk and Hony flow? Canaan cou'd scarce such Crops of Plenty show, Or Jordan's Lov'd and Unpolluted Streams Produce more Wonders than our Bounteous Thames. Do not all things that Feast the Eye and Ear, The Tast and Smell, for ever Flourish here? Having all this, what wou'd you more possess? Having so much, why would You make it less? Why shou'd the pleasant sounds of Concord cease? Or are you Sated with the Sweets of Peace? Why do you your Pernicious Doctrin Sow? And thro' the Land Seditious Libels strow? Spurn at the Vert'ous, Villify the Just, As if their Loyalty debauch'd their Trust? Why all this rank Invet'racy and hate? Unless you'd trace your Predecessors Fate, In all the Blood they shed from Forty one to Eight: For they, like you, mouth'd after Libertie, And they, like you, were conscious they were Free: Yet, tho' you know how ill their Fury far'd (Their Chief Enslaving whom the War had spar'd) In Opposition to all Sacred Laws, Once more you wou'd Revive their Impious Cause; Once more o'erthrow the Church, the State, the King, And from Blest Order make Confusion Spring: That wild Confusion that of late did rave, And sent so many Thousands to the Grave. But, Cruel Men, be yet advis'd and hear: The Specious Veil is off, and now quite bare, Stript to your Guilt, your Cloven Feet appear; True Fiends all o'er, and only fit to go And murmur in your Grand Cabal below. You'd best be Cautious then, and have a Care, Ingratitude will find no Favour there, Tho' it has miss'd the Stroke of Justice here:— As yet I mean has miss'd of;—for I've seen A Morning, tho' all Cloudless and Serene, Chang'd from a Glorious to a Gloomy Scene. The thick'ning Sky has furious Storms foretold, And Lo! Loud Thunder thro' the Air has rowl'd: Mountains, which one wou'd think stood firm as Fate, Have reel'd, as if they bent beneath their Weight, When Streight the Sun, with his Commanding Ray, Storm, Wind and Rain has Chas'd at once away, And with fresh Glories dress'd the New-born Day! So in the Sad Distractions of the State, When Mighty Charles shall yield to Mightier Fate, But may it first be long; (for Monarch's Breath Is frail like Ours, and must resign to Death;) What cou'd we wish shou'd that black Hour arrive, And York, the Nations other Prop, alive? But that he mount to the Imperial Throne, By Birth, and by the World's Consent his Own. What Hero else were fit to carry on That General Good Charles has so well begun? In such a Cause like Days bright Lord He'd rise, And dart his Glories thro' the Sullen Skies, Dissolve, or Drive the Factious Gloom away, Unrip Cabals where Treasons brooding lay, And shew 'em all to the full View of Day; While by a Justice, suited to the Time, He Punish'd Treach'ry equal to the Crime: But Ah! 'twere better, least this Time shou'd come, Now to turn Loyal, and divert your Doom. Mother Clark's Ghost, A SATYR: Occasion'd by a Quaker's Burying his Mother, (a Church of England Woman,) contrary to her Dying Will, in a Plot of Ground purchas'd by them for a Burial Place, before her Interment made use of as a Pound. TO The REVEREND Mr. Francis Henry Cary, Rector of Brinkworth, IN THE County of Wilts These be they who Separate themselves, Sensual, having not the Spirit. Jude ver. 19. From the Eternal Regions of the Blest, The Seat of Peace, of Glory, Joy and Rest, I for thy sake, O Wretch! To Earth repair, And cease a while to breath Celestial Air, To cure thy false Belief, and make the Truth thy Care. Not that You must expect such Gentle Words As here the Parent to the Child affords; A faint Reproof that spoils what it endears, An Anger for Offence that ends in Tears: A Sharper Med'cine I must now Impart, That to the very Soul shall Scorpions dart, And Lance the Core that rankles at your Heart. Ah! Was it not enough, Ingrateful Child, That You at first my Early Hopes beguil'd? And when I'd set Thee in the Only Way, After an Ignis fatuus falsly stray? A Flame that is by Envious Spirits driv'n From Place to Place, and banish'd out of Heav'n: A Roving Light that drills on Captious Fools, And leads 'em thorow Hedges, Bogs and Pools; In the dark Maze of Errour on they Post, To Reason deaf, and to Conviction lost. If any Motion rises in their Breast That says they're wrong, 'tis Certainly Supprest, So much their Zeal depends upon their Interest. In vain the Bright and Cloudless Hope appears That from the Scriptures points us to the Spheres; A Hope we never heard or read of yet That any of our Holy Church did quit On the meer Principles of Grace, or Wit: Quite thro' and thro' Survey your Impious Train, And find me One that did our Faith refrain, Unless for want of Sense, or hope of Gain. But was it not enough to lose your Way, And lose it in the open Face of Day Against the Light of Grace to shut Your Eyes, And from Eternal Truth Apostatize? But You must disobey the last Commands I ever made? And, with unhallow'd Hands, Throw, like a Dog's, my Corps into a Hole, And with my Body's Rest disturb my Soul. Is this the Fruit of my Maternal Care? Is this the Crop that Luckless Soil did bear? Is this the Comfort that by Pray'r we gain? The Pleasure that Rewards a Mother's Pain? I beg'd a Son, but, as he proves, the want Had been a Greater Blessing than the Grant. Who in my stead wou'd now a Mother be? Ev'n Satan did but fall from Truth like Thee, And Hell was founded in Apostacie. Perhaps You'll say (in nothing else accurst But that and Thee) because I was the first That in th'unhallow'd Place a Burial found, You laid me there to Sanctify the Ground: But that was done (if You cou'd understand Bare common Sense) already to your Hand: For was not many a Beast that us'd to stray, Or Stubbornly wou'd leave the Beaten Way, In that sad Durance mournfully Confin'd? And seem'd to Prophesy it was design'd A close Restraint for a more Brutal Kind. The Bones of Dogs and Cats have there been thrown, To make it proper to Receive Your Own; They have prepar'd Your Way and never yet Did any Type th'Allusion better fit; Your Harbingers at once in Sanctity and Wit. But in this Place methinks Your Blinking Guide, (Who yet believes there's Nothing sees beside) Grinning with Virulence, and swell'd with Spite, Thus speaks, tho' he can hardly Read, or Write. Sister (and gripes me by the Hand) Y' are wide Alas! All Ground alike is Sanctify'd: This is not worse than that, nor that than this, All made at once, and all are of a Piece. A Bog-House here, and there a A Name they in Derision give to our Churches. Tow'r-House stands, And who's not Conscious both were made with Hands? Who does not both as Human Structures view? Then if ones Hallow'd 'tothers Hallow'd too. About Your Burial why d'ye keep this pother? I had as lieve be put in One as 'tother. What matter is it where the Body's lain, Since, cast it where You please, 'twill rise again? What can the Proudest Edifice do more Than, at the General Call, their Dead restore? The Vilest Jakes that Privilege will have; Why lye You then not Quiet in your Grave? I've told, I cry, and further yet shall tell Such usage to a Parent was not well: But First, e'er more upon that Head I speak, I'll prove at large Your Arguments are weak. That God design'd the whole Creation Good We grant, nor was it Curst while Adam stood All things were Paradise; to Plough and Sow Was Vain, Corn did Uncultivated grow. The Earth was pregnant of her own Accord, And teem'd with Dayly Wonders for her Lord. No Floods above their Banks the Rivers rais'd, In the same Pasture Lambs and Tygers graz'd; One did not fear, nor yet was 'tother wild; But God rejoyc'd, and all his Creatures smil'd.— But soon the Noble Scene was chang'd; and now Our Bread's the Sweat and Labour of the Brow. The Sea unruly gain'd upon the Land, And here vast Desarts lie Immers'd in Sand: Curst for the sake of Man, the steril Soil Deceives our Hope and Mocks the Plough-mans Toil: At best the Cockle with the Corn does grow, Destroys one half, and keeps the other low. Enthusiasm so, and Sanguin Zeal, Once serv'd Religion and the Common Weal. But, tho' the Curse was Gen'ral, 'tis confest Some Regions yet scap'd better than the rest. In Palestine why did th'Almighty place The Israelites his Sacred Chosen Race, Unless the more abundantly to show His Blessings, which did there in Rivers Flow? Hony, and Milk, and Corn, and Wine and Oyl, And all that shews a happy Fruitfull Soil, They had, and these so plentifully giv'n, They lik'd the Change tho' fed before from Heav'n. And as some Portions we more Fruitfull view Than others, so there's some more Sacred too. When God of old to Moses did appear, Why did He in the Flaming Bush declare, Pull of thy Shooes, the Ground is Holy here, But, where He's more Immediately confest, To shew the Place more Hallow'd than the rest? For plucking of the Shooe was then and there The mark of Reverence, as the Hat is here; And in the Eastern Parts 'tis (when they'd shew A Defe'rence to Degree) what still they do. Why, on Araunah's Threshing Floor to stand, Was the fam'd Temple Built by God's Command? It's Fabrick on that very Spot to Rise, Where Isaac was design'd for Sacrifice? Unless to shew us from the Faithfull, there He wou'd Accept the Sacrifice of Prayer; There be Petition'd, Honour'd, Sought, Ador'd, For Blessings prais'd, and for our wants Implor'd, And of all Nations own'd Eternal Lord. There while that Fabrick stood his Name abode, Thro' that to Heav'n was made the Publick Road: Ev'n God Himself, to shew that He had there His Residence calls it—My House of Prayer. But that this to our Times may be apply'd, Our thinking Altars Sacred Justify'd; Pray let us ask if Piety or Guilt Was the prime Reason Churches first were built: Were those Divine and Noble Structures rear'd That God might in 'em be Blasphem'd, or Fear'd? You cannot so much Ignorance pretend, As not to know his Glory was the End. If then that was their Genuine known Design, All set apart for Ways and Works Divine; If to that Use and by Impulse from Heav'n, They were by Solemn Dedication giv'n; If still Employ'd for what they first were rais'd, And never to a Lower Name debas'd; 'Tis what the worst of Heathens wou'd not dare, So Impious! other Houses to compare With these of Gods, the Holy Courts of Pray'r: Holy, as far as Consecration may (And as it doubtless does) that Grace convey; And Solomon's was so no other way. 'Tis true that Heav'n has still an open Ear, But seems to be the most Attentive there: For tho' the Pious Christian shall be heard, More, their Petitions meet with more Regard; And much the Rather if th'Occasion be By Pray'r t'avert some Publick Misery, Or Praise, to shew his Blessings we receive With thankfull Hearts, and Act as we Believe. Lot tho' a Righteous Person, was but one, And scarce with much a do preserv'd his own; But Ten Just Men had sav'd the Cursed Town. For as we in some Royal Consort find, Where differ'ing Notes Harmoniously are Joyn'd, It does our Minds with Nobler Transports fill; Than if one Play'd, tho' he Perform'd with Skill: So when the Publick in his Building Joyn With Praise, Repentance, and in Hymns Divine, The only Mortal Sounds that charm his Ear, He bends the Heav'ns, and stoops half way to hear! Devoted to his Glory, all the Theme Begins and Ends with his Immortal Name. Ah! how much better in his Courts a Day Than Thousands are to those that keep away! What Malt-house, Stable, Barn, or Common Room Can with such Cause a Sanctity assume? Where, whatsoe'er You talk of inward Light, Th'Adulterer and the Thief may lodge at Night, Hypocrisy, Detraction, Strifes, Deceits, False Measures too, and a False Bag of Weights. But here, perhaps, You'll this Objection Start: His Chiefest Temple is a Holy Heart; There 'tis He dwells, nor there in vain Commands; God's not confin'd to Buildings made with Hands: The Heav'n of Heav'ns not able to Contain His Boundless Spirit;—Churches then are Vain. Ungodly Inference! for if every Where His Spirit is, by Consequence 'tis There. But take this Scripture Just as 'twas design'd, It only shews his Glory unconfin'd; That we can raise no Edifice to Suit His Pow'r, and ev'ry Boundless Attribute: For those in Nobler Instances were shown, In vaster Piles, and Buildings of His Own, The Earth His Footstool, and the Heav'ns His Throne. But tho' this Way exceeds the Pow'r of Man, W'are not deny'd t'approach Him as we can: The Heart He loves Obedient and Sincere, And may be truly said t'Inhabit there; But must we therefore quit his House of Pray'r? Search thro' the Sacred Page You'll quickly find The Coming thither, to all Humankind, A Thousand Ways inforc'd, a Thousand times injoyn'd; Our Saviour thither went, the Life! the Way! And not to follow Him is certainly to Stray. In vain you then against his House contend; 'Tis there He will be with us to the End: In vain our Form of Worship You accuse; How dare You think He will that Pray'r refuse, Which He himself Instructed us to use? Refuted thus by Arguments, so clear, And all our Churches Hallow'd made appear, Where shou'd the Christian be Interr'd but there? If there were Nothing else our Wills to awe, Ev'n Common Decency were here a Law. But if all this were false, what can You use, What shift my Disobedient Son t'excuse? For if, (as You so Brutally maintain,) It is no matter where the Body's lain, What need was there t'oppose my Dying Will, Ev'n where You Own th'Obeying not an Ill? Your Senseless Guide's Objections thus o'erthrown, Think not a better Fate attends Your Own. And since the Scriptures You pretend your Rule, And all that do not wrest 'em Knave, or Fool, What Passage there does make You understand You ought to slight a Parents just Command? When Jacob dy'd, You see what e'er He Will'd To the Minutest Circumstance fulfill'd: And when the Israelites remov'd, we find The Bones of Joseph were not left behind. How dare you among Christians shew Your Face, When ev'n among the Jews, that Murm'ring Race, We never read of One so void of Grace? To be by Thee thrown out of Hallow'd Ground, As if I'd been my Own self-Murderer found: The Service that our Holy Church Enjoyns Omitted, Slighted, that and her Divines; And nothing to distinguish't from the Curse Of Heathen Burial, but it's being Worse. The very Memory does with Horror seize My Airy Form, and frights her from her Ease! Not but I know You Impiously maintain That Service Superstitious, fond and vain; And urge, no Pray'r, or Part of Scripture read, Is usefull at the Burial of the Dead: That our Set Form's Illiterate, Poor and Rude, And all You speak with Heav'nly Pow'r indu'd And for that Reason, as defective, shun Our Way of Burial, and extoll your Own: That since th'Unerring Spirit is your Guide, All Human Aid You justly lay aside. But let the Fau'tless Scripture be admir'd, Whose Holy Pen-Men truly were Inspir'd: Thro' all succeeding Times, both worst and best, They have run down and born the strictest Test A Spirit there in ev'ry Line we see Of Hope, Love, Joy, and Immortalitie. If then in our Interment of the Dead Ought never yet was either sung or said, Deriv'd not from that Source of Pietie, But took from that, or does with that agree; What Light so e'er Ye feign Y'ave on your Side, We, following that, may boast a Brighter Guide. But now comes on the Test, for all to see Which Method most with Scripture does agree: With an Impartial Hand we'll both display, And Judge your self which takes the safer Way. View then, some of our Holy Church attend, To do the Last sad Office for their Friend: The Priest to meet the Corps advances bare, As all shou'd be that call on God by Pray'r: Then, gravely walking on before the Dead, These few Selected Texts our Rubrick bids him read. I am the Resurrection, saith the Lord; Eternal Life the Fruit of my Eternal Word. Who ever firmly does in Me believe The Grave shall not confine, nor Hell receive, But, tho' for Ages dead, shall rise again, and live. Nor only this; but those that will rely On what I Teach, Commission'd from on High, Shall, so Believing, Live; and never, never Dy! I know that my Redeemer ever lives, (And happy, happy He that so Believes! And that He at the Latter Day shall stand On Earth, Subjected all to his Command: And tho' in the mean time the Worms destroy This Body, it shall then arise to Joy: Then, in the Flesh, I shall the Almighty see, And by his Side the Filial Deitie, Whom (whatsoe'er w' are by the Scepticks told) I for my self shall see, and with these Eyes behold. Into this Wretched World we Nothing brought, Nor ('tis as Certain) shall we bear out Ought: Naked we came, and Naked we must go; So, it has ever been, and ever will be so. 'Tis God that gives, and that Resumes the same, 'Tis He that will again Rebuild our Frame: And Heav'n and Earth resound his Glorious Name. While this is said the Body on they Bear Into the Church it self, and rest it there. When by the Priest those Sacred Psalms are read That tell frail Man how fast his Glories fade: How like the Withering Grass He shrinks away, No sooner in Perfection, but Decay: Green in the Morning, in the Ev'ning dry The Sap Exhal'd that shou'd the Leaf Supply, And all the Verdure lost that Charm th'Admiring Eye. There, in Instructive Love, w' are truly told That 'tis but Wretched living to be old; Our Joy but Sorrow, and our Strength but Pain, And all our Human Expectations vain. Then least we shou'd be taken unprepar'd, W'are warn'd to Watch, and stand upon our Guard, To Wisdom all our Faculties apply, Number our Days, and Practise how to Dy. Next, (our Attention fixt,) he does repeat Part of th'Epistle that, (to Corinth Writ,) Our Resurrection from the Dead asserts, And with that Hope revives our Doubting Hearts: Tells us frail Man, that Creature of an Hour, Tho' Sown in Weakness, shall be Rais'd in Pow'r; And, from his Grosser Part refin'd and gone, Put the Bright Crown of Incorruption on. That Christ, Victorious, the great Mystick King, Has took from Hell its Pow'r, and Death his Sting: And if we stedfastly his Steps pursue, We over Death and Hell shall Triumph too. From thence the Corps they to the Grave Convey, Where, with uplifted Eyes, the Priest does say,— Man that from Woman does his Life receive, Has, at the most, but a short Time to live; Fades like a Flow'r, like Shadows, flits away, Like Ranging Bubbles never at a stay: So slight his Glories, and so frail his Breath, Ev'n in the mid'st of Life we are in Death. Of whom then (Lord!) Shall we for Succour call, Before whose Feet for Mercy prostrate fall But Thine? But Thine! (In thy Displeasure just) Who for our Sins dost humble us in Dust. Yet Holy, Merciful, Almighty God, Remit thy Terrours, and with-hold thy Rod, And yield us not, at our Expiring Breath, Into the bitter Pains of Endless Death,! Thou dost (O Lord!) Our In-most Secrets see, Our Thoughts, our Hearts are open all to Thee: Shut not, O shut not up thy Gracious Ear! But spare us! Spare us! and Accept our Pray'r, Look down in Mercy! and in Mercy hear! O God most Mighty! O most Holy Lord! Most Worthy Saviour! Judge! Eternal Word! O Suffer not, when our Last Hour takes place, For any Pains of Death we fall from Grace! This said, the Dead they to the Earth commit, To Earth, once more to be a Part of it; In full and firm Belief it from the Dust Again shall rise, thro' Christ, our Hope! Our Trust! Who our Vile Bodies from their Stains will free, That they may like his Glorious Body be, According to th'Almighty Pow'r giv'n By which, with Him, w'are made Joint-Heirs of Heav'n. Whom wou'd not here a fervent Love excite To say, what John Divinely did indite? I heard a Voice from Heav'n thus crying—Write— Write—Blest are those that in their Saviour Dy— Ev'n so, the Sacred Spirit does reply; No more with anxious Thoughts, or Cares distrest, Lain down in Peace, they from their Labours rest. Lastly to God (with whom the Spirits live Of Holy Man) their Thanks they humbly give, That did, in Mercy, the Deceased free From all the Miseries of Mortality. Imploring that He wou'd (their Trials past) Th'Elect Accomplish, and his Kingdom hast: Beseeching further, they by Grace may be Made of the same Selected Company: That so, at the Last Trumpet's dreadful Sound, When the re-quickn'd Dead shall cleave the Ground, They may not Perish in the wild Affright, But, rising, be accepted in his Sight: And from th'Eternal Son that Crown receive, Which He, Presiding, to the Just shall give; Pronouncing thus to all that Love and Fear His Holy Name:—Ye Blessed! Enter here! Receive the Kingdom from the first prepar'd For Right'ous Souls—Lo! Here Your Bright Reward! Your Seat a Throne, and Cherubins Your Guard. What Man cou'd, hearing this be cold in Zeal? And not a sort of Elevation feel, When such Divine Discourse his Spirit warms, His Hope enlarges, and his Patience Arms; Graving our Ends so deeply on our Hearts, Not one that hears unedify'd departs. Our Rubrick thus. Now your Enthusiast view, And let us see what He can better do, That Canting Elder of Your Sullen Crew: Who following all that's Wrong, and leaving Quite Our Holy Rules, Commenc'd a Saint in Spite: Then rising up to be by Blockheads priz'd, All Truth he darkn'd, and all Sense despis'd. Peevish quite thro'; for never had a Sot With Intellects so cold a Head so hot; And from that Spring his Notions bubbling come, With heat of Brain boil'd up into a Scum. His Reason does with his Religion Suit, And shews us that as once a Speaking Brute Might by his Language for a Teacher pass, The Man might here be taken for the Ass. At Riches rails, and yet to Gain a Slave, Fool to the Core—But less a Fool than Knave So sour his Look it turns what he does say, As Runnet Changes Milk to Curds and Whey. In fine (no longer on this Theme t'insist) His Dullness is a thick Egyptian Mist, A Fog that may be felt; a dismal Night Of Gloomy Error! Total loss of Sight!— But in our Goshen, Heav'n be prais'd, there's Light. Thus, Gifted and adorn'd with Graces fit For such a Charge, methinks I see Him yet, With the same Dullness pregnant in his Face, As then when first my Corps was brought in Place; Where what with Nonsense, and most vile Grimace, He turn'd it from a Funeral to a Farce. For, of a sudden, glaring with his Eyes, (A sign the Spirit was about to rise,) And with his Fist Discharging on his Breast A peal of Blows, enough it is confest T'have rais'd a Spirit both in Man and Beast; For to be soundly Drubb'd, yet Patient be, Not Balaam's Pad cou'd bear, and why shou'd He? But suddenly he burst into a Tone, That yet was neither Talk, or Scream or Groan, But made of all; and did resemble best The out-cry of the Gad'aren Swine possest: While, as He eagerly pursu'd his Tale, He foam'd as fluently as Bottl'd Ale, And threw the Froth of Inspiration round, Like Holy Water on enchanted Ground. But granting all this while He had his Wits, What then? can Conscience have Convulsion Fits? The Hick-up on our Piety take hold? Or can Religion catch a Hooping Cold? Thus thus with forcing out, and sucking in His Nasty Breath, he made this frightful Din; Screaming as loud as Women in their Pains, Or, at a Riding, He that flings the Grains: And all the while his Breast still plying home, Just as the Devil did the Wiltshire Drum. So did the Priestess of Apollo rave; The Fumes ascending strongly from the Cave O'erpowr'd her Brain; and then the Tempter seiz'd The Fort, and us'd her Organs as he pleas'd; While by her Dreadful Voice, and Rolling Eyes, She does but vouch, and vend His Impious Lyes. Alas! Religion is not to be found In Fright, Grimace, and in a bellowing sound, As if 'twere only Noise that Truth adorns; Like Gelders, pleas'd with winding of their Horns. Such wild, confus'd, Enthusiastick Starts Imprint no Charm, or Reve'rence on our Hearts; But rather shew, as Running Nags and Mares Must have their Heats, your Teachers, too, have theirs, And fling, and Switch, and Spur to reach the Goal, As if they were the Jockeys of the Soul. Sometimes, indeed, the Spirit, restive grown, Wou'd sink down Sullen to a lower Tone; But as a Jade a tiring will not Stir Unless you freely use the Whip and Spur, So on his Stomach laying but a Blow, He made the Stream of Nonsense freshly flow: So Marrow-bones, if beat, the Oyl will run, And Thunder drives the Rain the faster down. Tempests, we read, the very Rocks disjoyn'd, But God was not in the Tempestuous Wind: Earth-quakes the Hills did shake, and Centre tear With dreadful Flaws, th'Almighty was not there: The Flames did next to the wide Arch aspire, Nor yet was God in the Avenging Fire; But in a Sound that sooner reach'd his Ear, The Still, small Voice of Piety and Pray'r. Such was his Action, to his Language fit, For ne'er were Words remov'd so far from Wit. The Matter such, as nothing did Comprize But a vast heap of Inconsistencies: No Method, Nothing congruous in the whole, No Shape, Connexion, Spirit, Life or Soul! Suppose a Madman, Starting from a Dream, Shou'd, half awake, assume some freakish Theme, He sooner wou'd the Parts t'agreement bring, And make the Whole a more Coherent thing. Thus (Ramble, Bombast, and all Fume his Brain) In a most frightfull, wild, and hideous Strain He talk'd two tedious Hours; but nothing said That did respect the Living, or the Dead, That warn'd us for our Changes to prepare, Or shew'd th'Occasion of their coming there. While thus He bawl'd, full many a Ruful Sigh His Hearers gave, as if resigning Life. Some groan'd aloud, and hardly cou'd refrain, (Th'Inspiring Vapours rising to the Brain,) To lanch out in the like distracted Strain. Others, more mild, remov'd from that Extreme, Sat sniv'ling as their Faith were turn'd to Flegme. Some gaping stood as if their Mouths were Ears; (Tho' there's no other Animal that wears His Luggs so large, and Visible as theirs;) That 'twou'd have puzzl'd and confounded Thought, Which was most Brute, the Teacher, or the Taught. Nonsense You love, and have what you desire, As Swine, by Choice, wou'd ne'er be out of Mire. But tir'd at length, his Fists their Blows forbore; The Spirit, warn'd by that, did rage no more, But fainter grew, than with a Hum—gave o'er. So when a Bag-pipe Player with his Arm Does cease to ply the Bellows, all the Charm Is at an end; only the Base does moan A while, when the In-Breathings lost and gone, That did Inspire it with the Ruful Tone. To close up all, he lastly made it known That what he had Discours'd was all his own; That, till he thither came, he pass'd the Day Without one Previous Thought of what to say; That the dead Letter sow'd the Seeds of Doubt, He better knew the Mind of God without; Nor had among 'em let one Tittle fall But what came then from Heav'n, Illumination all! Here (railing at the Learn'd and better read) The Dust was tumbl'd in upon the Dead. Then (ev'ry one first Palming of the Guide) Stupid, Untaught, and so Unedify'd, They Zealously went off to Beef and Ale; The only Prudent Part of all the Tale. Why (O ye Pow'rs!) does Wretched Man abuse That Gift he may to such Advantage Use? Reason! that, like the Star, the Pilot's Guide, Thro' Faith's unbounded Ocean, deep and wide, Points out the Way, secure from Storm and Tide: That Light Extinct, which gives our Faith it's Eyes, We straight encline to all Absurdities; On Waves of Pride, or of Presumption toss'd, And wreckt at last upon the horrid Coast, For where there is no Reason Hope is lost; And how of Hope can we Idea's frame, Or Truth, if in our Intellects w'are Lame? Without our Reason no Religion can Be Taught, Defended, or Imbib'd by Man, That is the Base on which our Faith must stand, That gone, like Water Grasp'd it quits your Hand. What Path to Happiness can Ideots show? Or what can Brutes, who have no Reason, know Of Saving Faith? Or Children at the Breast, Or those that are Bigotted, or, all one, Possest? 'Tis only those to whom that Guide is giv'n, And Grace to follow, tread the Path to Heav'n. That Stamps the Seal on ev'ry Mystery, Our SAVIOUR's Merits teaches to apply, To live Resign'd, and so Resign'd to Dy. Thus Reason join'd with Faith can wonders do, Take in the whole Creation at a View, To all past, present, and to come extend, And hope for Glories that must never end. But Faith without her Guidance can't subsist, All then is Errour, Wilderness, and Mist: From thence the Downfall of Religion flows, For Nothing he Believes that Nothing knows; And without Reason Nothing can be known, Not that our Sight, or Hearing are our Own. 'Tis true, in some things Faith does take a Flight Beyond her View, but leaves a Track so Bright, That Reason follows by the Beams of Light. Tho' Providence her curious Eye does bar To see thro' Mysteries—there She sees they are, Commends 'em to our Faith, which to refuse For false and spurious, and the true to choose; And not with Modern Guides, and Modern Crimes, To blend the Truth of Apostolic Times: For then the Bounds of our Belief were fixt, Tho' now broke up, and Lyes to Truth annext By ev'ry mad Expounder of the Text. But Reason you disclaim, and on your Side Believe You have ev'n an Unfailing Guide, A Scheme of Truth by Inspiration giv'n, And Grace Divine Immediately from Heav'n: That you as near Communication hold With God, as Peter, or as Paul of old; So nothing e'er in Publick Teach or Write, But what th'unerring Spirit does indite. If so, then all you to the Press commit Is equally Divine with Sacred Writ: For all You Teach, like that, must Perfect be, Done by the same Infallibilitie; For ev'n those holy Elevated Men, That Spirit moving, did but hold the Pen. What may w' expect from them that will maintain Notions so vastly Monstrous and Prophane! For if the Faith which they pretend is true, What might they not for its Promulging do? Their Pow'rfull Word wou'd Devils dispossess, Convert ev'n Atheists, and whole Nations bless, The Lame wou'd walk, the Blind unclose their Eyes, The Sick recover and the Dead arise! But you no Miracle for Proof can shew, But that you dare believe your Doctrin true; Amidst your Blasphemies forgetting quite, Tho' you are Blind, that others have their Sight. For if no Man to Heav'n can have pretence Whose Guide is Knowledge, and whose Creed is Sense; If Grace is but Enthusiastick Fits, And Piety resigning of our Wits, Then Bedlam must be needs the best of Schools, Enlightn'd with the Trance and Dream of Fools: There, in Exactest Colours, You may see A Scheme of Your Infallibility; There, and there only, may be always shown A Church that nearest Parallels Your Own. For pray, what can their Madness make 'em do More than your odious Faith exacts from You? Can they be easier to Perversness known? Or with more Spite the Sacrament disown? That Institution which our Lord enjoyn'd To keep his Everlasting Love in Mind. Can they with the Baptismal Vow dispence With smaller Zeal, or greater Impudence? That Vow which brings within the Christian Pale The Chosen Flock, and, certain to Prevail, Sets us where Heav'n and Endless Life is view'd, When in the Sacred Eucharist renew'd. Can Women there, (to strong Illusions sold,) By Inspiration, louder Preach and Scold? Make Reason and Religion clash and fight With Sharper Fangs? till, work'd into a Fright, They've lost themselves in Prophecy and Light: Tho' Paul, of old, the Giddy Freak did blame, And openly reproac'd it as a Shame: What is it now then, Inspiration lost? And they no more of various Tongues can boast By like Effusion of the Holy Ghost? For of the Spirit (faithful to their Tone) So little Sign they have in Language shown, Your very Teachers cannot Spell their Own. Can they on Dignity Reproaches throw With more Inveteracy and Gall than You? Shew less respect to Place, and greater hate To Sov'raign Edicts and Commands of State? Tho' w'are for Conscience sake, by Holy Paul, Advis'd t'Obedience and Submission all; Our Saviour too enjoyning to obey, And what is Cæsar's due to Cæsar pay. Can they (if they had leave to walk the Street) Shew less Regard to any Friend they meet? Pass by a Swine, (tho' but a Sullen Brute,) He'll grunt, which is his Method of Salute. A Dog to him he knows will wag his Tail, A Decent Homage that he'll never fail, How much below a Beast must Mortals be, If Beasts outdo 'em in Civilitie? As if, because 'tis said, God do's respect No Persons, we must utterly reject All just Behaviour, only meant to shew Honour, as Paul enjoyns, where Honour's due. Can to our Priests they viler Language give? Who by a Law so old their Tithes receive, And to the Altar bred, must of the Altar live. True, Scribes and Pharisees by Christ are blam'd; You call them so who of that Christ are nam'd: Quite contrary to what our Saviour thought, And to that Love in which he Liv'd and Taught. Can they with a more wild and barb'rous Zeal Think ev'ry Mortal damn'd, beyond Repeal, That will not walk with them their Rambling Way, Their Reason quit, and be as mad as they? Which is so a high a Pitch of Wickedness, No Thought can reach it, and no Words express; And, since our Faith began, must be at least A Million Damn'd for one Believer Blest. 'Tis well for Man that Man's no Deity, How sad th'Effects of such a Pow'r wou'd be! Well did that Prince the Gracious Nature scan, That cry'd, before the Pestilence began, Let us not fall into the Hands of Man! Hear me (O Wretch!) this vain Belief give o'er, And follow thy Fantastick Guides no more: Back to thy Mother Church and own thy Sin, She with Extended Arms will take thee in Weeping for Joy; and, thy Contrition true, Set the Bright Realm of Glory in thy View: Where for one single Sinner that returns To God, and all his past Presumption mourns, There's more Exulting and Tryumphant show Than on the Days when Kings are Crown'd below. With Reasons strong and plain, (to which I might Add many more, of equal Force and Weight,) I've let you see Your Stream of Faith's impure, And can't the Test of Truth and Sense endure, But shrinks before 'em, of a Suddain gone, Like Darkness when the Tide of Light comes on. Remember (if the Parable y'ave read) What Abraham to the Fool in Torment said, And don't this Message Impiously deride, Least what he spoke shou'd be to you apply'd. If to the Word (says he) they shut the Ear, And Moses and the Prophets will not hear, They'll never be Perswaded Truth is said, Ev'n tho' one come to tell it from the Dead. But see! the Morning do's her Beams display, And warns me upward to a Brighter Day! Believe like me, that you may thither rise, And follow this Ascension thro' the Skies. [Ascends swiftly out of Sight. THE MURMURERS, &amp;c. A SATYR. In Two Parts. Written soon after the late Revolution. [The First Part.] Who ever for Himself wou'd Safety know, Shou'd Act, alike, for Publick Safety too; 'Tis there our Private Happiness depends; From thence it rises, and with that it ends. In Factious Times, with Violence o'errun, What Human Comfort can we call our own? Rape, Plunder, Devastation, Fire and Blood Rage thro' the Land like an Impetuous Flood, The more Destructive as 'tis more withstood. But there where Peace and Mutual Trust preside Dwells Plenty, Wealth, and ev'ry Joy beside; Who those Advance, and only those approve, Begin below the Life they'll lead above: By Peace the Happiness we hope for there Descends, and lets us first behold it here. What then must the Flagitions Wretch be stil'd That wou'd subvert, and make her Nature wild, Who of her Self's so Gentle and so Mild? Now at a Time when with her Brightest Charms She, like a Bride, wou'd Sink into our Arms; Then dive into the Heart and Triumph there, To shew She can be fond as well as Fair: When God-like William, Prodigal of Breath, To Court her dares the last Extremes of Death; And Gen'rously again himself exiles To bring her Home, adorn'd with Foreign Spoils, And with her here enjoy the Harvest of his Toils. Curst then be they who, siding with our Foes, Ingratefully his just Designs oppose, And to that height of Villany advance To have Him fall a Sacrifice to France: In vain—His Genious mounts above their Rage, Shall Honour this, and Bless the Coming Age. Let it not here be urg'd in their Defence, Their Passive Temper shews their Innocence; No Persons tread so near the Verge of Vice As those that are most Scrupulously Nice; Rather than not a seeming Slip avoid They'll run on Ruin, and see all Destroy'd. What Tenderness of Conscience can they have That Thousands wou'd destroy for Three they save? Such Non-Resistance, rightly understood, Wou'd draw up ev'ry Sluce of War and Blood. Let Slav'ry Join'd with Pope'ry but advance, Led on by the Successful Pow'r of France, And they themselves wou'd soon and sadly see The Sanguine wild Effects of Passive Policie. Ay—But their Oaths;—And grant the Plea were true, Th'Objection yet wou'd comprehend but few: For one that has a past Allegiance Sworn, A Thousand Murmur but to serve a Turn. But say indeed the former taken Vow, To many, is the Tye that holds 'em now; Let such Remember by that very Deed They're bound to those that Legally Succeed: The Prince that wou'd not Rule by Law is gone, And, Abdicating, laid his Scepter down. And that no Man, or Parties may Repine; In those that now Succeed Him, Heav'n does join Both the Direct and the Collateral Line. But let these Cautious Men, that will not Swear, Be pleas'd to Answer me one Question fair: Since Scruples only can concern our Selves, Why wou'd they dash their Neighbours on the Shelves? Why do they Talk, and Preach, and Write as if The Present Oath wou'd Ruin all Belief? Striving to bring (what never can be done,) (Or, if it cou'd, wou'd yet not better one) The Size of ev'ry Conscience to their own. But little is by such that Rule pursu'd, Of old advanc'd, and thro' all Times renew'd That Private By-Regards must yield to Publick Good. The General Voice our Glorious Monarch crown'd, And still the Few are by the Many bound. Mark in our Senate when they Laws dispence, Tho' almost half have, oft, a different Sense, Yet no Resentment at the Rules express'd, Because the Major part concludes the rest. In short, to Sum up all:—The Government Was alter'd with, or without God's Consent; If with it then 'tis Impious to complain, Without, he yet Permits the Present Reign; So renders either Way their last Engagement vain. But madly we to clear this Point pretend; Let Truth accuse, and Prejudice defend, And mark if the Debate will ever end: No Arguments w'ave yet in Publick shown, (And in no Cause were better ever known) Have hitherto so much as but Convicted one: On Future Mischief bent, they will not see Their Present safety and Felicity. What ever Doctrine or Perswasion then, Was first Imbib'd by these Pernicious Men, (For such a Creed all Ancient Faith devours) What ever is their Church—They're not of OURS. Of OURS! That takes from Scripture all her Rules, Her Business, saving, not perverting Souls. Of OURS! Howe'er at home by such decry'd, Envy'd, or Prais'd thro' all the World beside. Of OURS! allow'd the Primitively true; 'Tis Insolence and Dullness make the New: Her Pedigree we from th'Apostles draw, All the Reformers were but Sires in Law: They saw the Errors which her Charms did hide, Impos'd by Rome's Unconscionable Guide, That grasp'd at Earthly Pow'r with Unexampl'd Pride; Saw 'em, and of those Failings stript her bare, When streight, like Op'ning Buds, She did appear In all the Sweetness of Her Native Dress; Nor has her Age yet made her Beauties less: And thus Originally pure, Embrac'd Her in their Arms, and held the Blessing fast. Nor does She too much Her own Worth prefer But owns Her Members, and her Self may err. What e'er is urg'd by Rome's Pontificate , Not Peter ever reach'd a Sinless State; Nor did (by what we in his Writings see) Assert his own Infallibility. But let us here the different Ways behold Of Him that fish'd for Men, and Popes that fish for Gold. From what He Writes a strict Obedience Springs; But They set up ev'n for Dethroning Kings. He as a Servant did himself Survey; And These assume a more than Regal Sway. Where e'er He went Attendance still was spar'd; But They can never move without a Guard. He with one Sermon did his Thousands save; And These have made their Thousands Fool and Knave. He with Contempt did Yellow Earth behold, For which, with Them Salvation's Bought and Sold. O Scandal! Which in Ancient Times they ne'er Cou'd have Conceiv'd wou'd Sit in Peter's Chair! Thus Pride or Frenzy gave that Notion Birth That plac'd a Guide Infallible on Earth; A Grace on Angels not bestow'd, and then How much less likely to be found in Men? Search all the Annals since the World began You'll Sinless find but one,—And He was more than Man. Th'Eternal Word was with our Nature join'd, And God Himself Transfus'd into the Mind, Before that Wonder he was pleas'd to rear Of Human Birth to reach Perfection here. 'Tis Him we Imitate, and Righteous call;— But Copies ne'er cou'd reach th'Original: The Wond'rous Race of Fau'tless Life He ran; And He's the Wise, the Happy, Holy Man That comes as near the Pattern as he can: So to Endeavour Sets all Heav'n in view; And so t'Endeavour's all we here can do. Nor let the Private Spirit here oppose With Canting Terms, and Sniv'ling thro' the Nose; Who tho' it most reviles the Papal Sin, Sets up a like unfailing Judge within. Each Sectarist in his Breast believes he there Has all that Popes ascribe to their Unerring Chair; And, Unappealable, can there decide All Truth,—His own Illuminated Guide. But certainly (if I may Judge for one) The Mind is best by what it utters known: If Fau'tless they can live, it follows, too, They're so in what they Preach as well as what they do: But in this Point we need but only here Their Holding forth, and the Conviction's clear. What e'er they boast of Supernatural Light, There's little taught but Prejudice and Spite: One set of Blockheads vending Fustian here, Another Senseless Class inverting there Clearness to Doubt, and Comfort to Despair. So strange a blending we of Doctrines view, So vilely do they Scriptures dash and brew, That no Belief is wanting—But the True. Whatever from their Guide the Rout requires, All Sense he darkens, and all Ears he tires, Yet Impudently says he speaks as God Inspires: Whereas His Spirit Nothing does dictate But what is Wisdom, Congruous, Fau'tless, Fate, Unchang'd, Immortal, and Immaculate. A Glimpse we have of it indeed, a Ray That like the Magi's Star does point the Way, And shew, among Opinion's dangerous Shelves, W'are not in things too deep to rest upon our Selves. His Spirit all sustains, and all does see; There's nothing else Infallibilitie. But grant he were dispos'd that Gift to give, What Mortal Mind's Capacious to receive? The Burst of Glory wou'd consume our Frame, As Wings of Flies singe in a Pow'rful Flame. Enough it is, and shou'd all Doubt decide, That He has left the Scriptures for our Guide Dictated by that Spirit, and contain All Precepts, needful to Salvation, plain. For Points Abstruse lie out of Human Sight, And while vain Men wou'd make that Darkness Light, And, big with Notion into Secrets pry That have forbid Access to Mortal Eye, They weave themselves in their own Web so close, Nor Falshood, Truth, nor Wit can get 'em loose; From this to that for ever whirl'd about; Uneasy, in Disputes; yet more Uneasy, out. Thus, owning She may Err, our Church is Right, And in that seeming Failing hits the White; Our Saviour's Blood is then for Sin apply'd, Or else in vain he Liv'd in vain he Dy'd: For, as for Merit properly our Own, Nature and Frailty say we can have none. A Saviour of Mankind had needless been, If Human Worth cou'd have aton'd for Sin: Good Works is but Morality, no more, In which the Jews Excell'd us heretofore; And (tho' with Grief we must the Truth allow) The very Turks, 'tis fear'd, excell us now. But Christianity, that fines our Thoughts, Is Faith, Hope, Patience, and Remorse for Fau'ts. If after Adam GOD must Human be E'er Man cou'd from that fatal Lapse be free, It argues our own Insufficiencie. Boundless Compassion! for by Him w'ave been Freed from the Forfeit—tho' not freed from Sin. The Sacred Page says Positively thus— He bore our Griefs and was Chastiz'd for us, Which cou'd we Sinless be in very Deed, Were a Compassion Man wou'd never need. Beside, this Principle is fixt and true, That what's not Needful GOD wou'd never do; And thence we to this sure Conclusion run, That it was Needful, too, because 'twas done: Then Man must Err;—and Romish Councils had Retracted many Things perversely bad, (So by themselves confess'd) but that 'twou'd tell Their Papal Church was not Infallible; And make their poor bigotted Followers see Th'Unerring Chair was all a Fallacie. Is then that Church Infallible that will, Owning She Errs, run on in Error still? That knows not which Her Mighty Guide to call Whether a Pope, a Council, Church, or all? How justly then (while thus they disagree Which is that One) may we Exclude all Three?— And so Good-Night—Infallibility. But notwithstanding all the Fau'ts they've shown, They yet expect in our Demeanour none: For why that horrid Cry, with Frowning Brow, Where's (Passive Fops) Your Non-Resistance now? As if to save our Throats had been a Crime Unprecedented in all former Time; Or yet a Mark of Anti-Christ cou'd be Not to be Slaves, when Heav'n had set us Free.— But we shall prove, in its due Order shown, The Fault so little—that perhaps 'tis none. I say as many of our Church have done, (We have, perhaps, a Thousand Votes for one) The Passive Doctrine in the former Reign Was what cou'd never Settle in my Brain. What People ever bore all Human Harms Ev'n then when they cou'd right themselves by Arms? Had I been to have Preach'd up Kingly Right, I wou'd have blown the Bubble from my Sight; Nor, puffing up a proud and Dangerous Mind, Ascribe it Pow'r which Nature ne'er design'd. A Principle like this defends the Throne, Tho' Lucifer himself shou'd Sit thereon, And leaves us Nothing we can call our Own. It makes the Monarch Arbitrary still, And sets no bound to a Licentious Will; Destroys the Magna Charta's sacred Right, And makes our very Guards against us Fight; Puts Arms in Tyrants Hands, augments their Pow'rs; And gives our best Defences out of Ours: For Non-Resistance is but sitting still, And let the Men in Pow'r do what they will, Enslave, Demolish, Ravish, Burn, or Kill. But say it were a Fault, and Grace we want In thus Dissenting from the Passive Cant; Allowing this, why is it push'd so far? Alas! w'ave own'd already Man may Err. But since with this You may not be Content, (For Guiltiest Men can say they're Innocent,) We'll fairly offer other Argument. If I'm not culpable by Law to Dy, (For Lawless Force is not Authority) Rather than You shou'd take this Life of mine I'd save it tho' the Struggle cost thee Thine: At least, so far ev'n Reason bids me Arm; Divest him of the Pow'r of doing harm. Nor rises any Error from the Fact, For Heav'n it self does Authorize the Act. Nor Laws Divine, or Human, give Pretence To let him suffer, who thy Insolence Repressing, kills thee in his own Defence. Well then, we'll put the Case the best we may:— The Contracts between Kings and Subjects say, They bound are to Protect and These Obey: We own our Distance;—they are Seated high, We lick the Dust;—but e'en they are, thereby, Not Priviledg'd to do us Injury: Tho', without Subjects, pray what is a King? A little, poor despis'd, defenceless Thing: What e'er is urg'd by Favorites wanting Sense, It is the General Homage makes the Prince: In vain their Birth and Soveraignty they boast The People not assenting all is lost. Happy! when neither side does Law controul, Nor these for Liberty, nor those for Rule: For while they keep within that Legal Pale, Nor Arbitrary Sway, nor Faction can prevail: Then Kings are Great, and then their Subjects thrive; These have their Rights, they their Prerogative. So that the Monarch Seated on a Throne, Must weave the Publick Inte'rest with his Own, Allow the Ancient Rights Prescription gave, And more than those the Subject must not crave: For Profuse Princes, if they give too fast, May whoop for their Prerogative at last. Now, when e'er Subjects, swell'd with Hate or Pride, Assume what Law and Nature have deny'd, Conspire in their Ambition, Rage, or Spite, And make Attempts upon the Regal Right, They break the Contract; broken, they are brought To Punishment Proportion'd to the Fau't: In such a Case the Soveraign You will find Absolv'd from his,—it can no longer bind; And tho' his Oath was to Protect, yet now He cuts' em off,—nor is it Breach of Vow: Just as we lop a Gangreen'd Limb away To save the rest, and make th'Infection stay. With equal Reason then, when Kings themselves (That shou'd be Pilots) dash us on the Shelves; Making th'Establish'd Constitution fly, And shoot the Dreadful Gulf of Anarchy; Dispence with Laws that long in force have stood, Meant, made, and prov'd to be for Publick Good, And side with Principles that strike at Blood; Pulls down the Good old Frame, a bad one rears, He breaks the Contract; and it plain appears, The Subjects then too are absolv'd from Theirs; And Jointly stand oblig'd by strength of Hand The Aggressor's Lawless Forces to withstand, Who Tyrant like, to keep his Slaves in awe, By Will wou'd rule, and make his Pow'r his Law. Oppress'd so far, for their Defence they may, Must fly to Arms, there is no middle Way: For then 'tis God the Difference does decide, He who the Great Machine of War does Guide, And knows the best which is the Juster Side. But 'tis not now as in our Father's Time, Their Case was then undoubtedly a Crime; A Crime, perhaps, ev'n yet not Expiated; Some fell by Plague and Fire, and some have bled, And more, more Blood, perhaps, too may be shed. They fear'd what they'd, indeed, no Cause to fear They dream'd of Danger that it wou'd appear, And Knaves and Fools were hir'd to place the Object near. But we were certain, we both heard and saw; In vain we pleaded Property and Law: So sure they were, that the most moderate Mind Wou'd fairly own our Ruin was design'd. The Arm was held up and the shining Knife, With a strong Swing, descending swift on Life: But who can what Heav'n pre-ordains withstand? An Angel, as of old, did stop the Hand, And like the Ram caught in the Thorny Snare Seiz'd them—but us the Sacrifice did spare. What Safety then had Non-Resistance giv'n Tho' boasted as a Precept taught by Heav'n? Our Case (while we the Papal Burthen bore) Was just like that of Samsons's heretofore. Our Laws, that shou'd our Properties secure, Were bound with Cords of Arbitrary Pow'r; And by a set of Treach'rous Men, were just Delivering o'er to mad Philistian Lust: But as He then to hear the Foe but nam'd Broke from his Bands, to Glorious Deeds inflam'd, So when from Warlike William, and from Heav'n The Signal for our LIBERTY was giv'n, (Like Him endanger'd to the last Degree,) Exerting all our Strength, we all at once were free. “Shall I my Mother tortur'd see, or worse, “Behold her Ravish'd by Insulting Force, “And not to her Assistance fiercely bend “Because he is a Prince or was a Friend? My Country is my Mother, She beset With Spoilers, jointly to her Ruin met, And crying out for Succour;—if her Aid I run not to, or Factious, or Affraid, Ev'n I am one by whom She is betraid. How Slavish then, or of a Blacker Dye, Were those that screw'd the Passive String so high, And still defend, precarious Pow'r to get, Perversly what so foolishly was writ? Our Sons might well have blam'd our Want of Sense, Had we been Preach'd out of our own Defence, And to the Papal Rage expos'd their Innocence. Had they forseen this Change they had not wrote; Much less wou'd have Imbib'd the Dangerous Thought That true Religion (whence our Freedom Springs) And Liberty are Inconsistent Things; Or that no Man a Christian can commence That shakes not Hands with Honesty and Sense. O Men in Policy much, much to seek! So finely Twisted, and the Stuff so weak No Wonder that this Rope of Sand did break. But with their Principles we now have done, And in our Second Part they shall themselves be shown. The Second Part. When Pharaoh's Num'rous Host was now no more, And Israel's Guide had reach'd the happy Shore, One wou'd have thought, so many Wonders past, They wou'd have been all Gratitude at last; And with loud Voices, in Eternal Lays, Have Prais'd their God, and kept his Right'ous Ways. Quite contrary we Read th'Event was found; In a few Days, thro' all the Camp around, 'Twas Slight, Despondence, and a Murmuring Sound: Their downward Souls, not daring to be free, Abhor'd the Hand that gave 'em Liberty. But never was there known, as Authors tell, (Gifted alike to Murmur and Rebel) Before our Times that People's Parallel. What more from Impious Pharaoh cou'd they fear Than we from Rome's more fatal Slavery here? Not a worse Scene was the Erythrean Shore Behind their Tyrant, and the Sea before. And yet e'er we cou'd think Defence was near, The Storm was silenc'd, and the Heav'ns were clear; Away at once the threat'ning Terrors fled, And Peace and Safety settl'd in their stead. We all cry'd Liberty! Enfranchisment! Trade! Plenty! Property! with one Consent; And Orange under Heav'n was own'd the Mighty Instrument. The very Men themselves that now we blame For changing Masters, then believ'd the same; Their Service in the Common Cause they'd boast, And argu'd but for Him w'ad all been lost: Their Danger then had made 'em lose their Spite, And in their very Fears they found their Sight: But Cowardice no Gen'rous Fruit can bear, And a forc'd Duty is the least sincere: For soon Conversing with the Popish Crew, (Nor to their Safety, nor their Reason true,) They left their Party—and their Senses too. Why else, when so much Publick Good is done, Is such a strange Dissatisfaction shown? Why shou'd they wish his Ruin who so late Sav'd 'em from theirs, and rais'd a sinking State? Why shou'd they wear so diffident a Brow? All smiling lately, and all Railing now! Unless 'twas only Change they aim'd at then, And, not Preferr'd, are for a Change agen: More Proud than Just, and more Perverse than Wise, Nor care if Kingdoms fall so they can rise. But that we may the livelier paint their Crimes, Once more we'll touch upon the Papal Times. The Bow stood bent and levell'd at our Lives, Our Throats were stretch'd beneath the Roman Knives, While Rape but for the Word expecting stood, First to begin in Lust, and end in Blood. The Rights and Freedoms we so much admire, All Hopeless lay, and Gasping to expire. Torn Charters fell, thick as a Fleecy Show'r, Blown thro' the Land by Arbitrary Pow'r. Reliev'd of all these Evils, who'd have here Deny'd the Tribute of their Praise and Pray'r? Quite contrary (with equal Jewish Spite) These Men are blind amidst the Glare of Light; And over to a strong Delusion giv'n, Murmur at Mercies in the Face of Heav'n. In vain our Hero's happy in his Toils, In vain the War does spare the British Isles, In vain Augusta triumphs, and Eusebia smiles; In all the Blessings Subjects can possess, Their only Comfort is to make 'em less. By what strange Witchcraft cou'd their Papal Friends Work 'em so quickly to their Treach'rous Ends? Where cou'd they the accurst Ingredients have, That can so soon compose the Fool and Knave? Disposing so their Poison thro' the whole; It quite inverts the Truth, and black'ns to the Soul. Nor do they only Silly Sheep infect, But oft the Hand that shou'd those Sheep protect, Of this we've bloody Instances of old; But nothing than their last more Base, and Bold, Which made us Objects of that Monarch's Hate Whom we had lifted to the Regal State, In Spite of Factions, and almost in Spite of Fate. The Ways and Means we need not mention here, Seen by all Eyes, and heard by ev'ry Ear, How e'er our Loyal Deeds had like to cost so dear: But, hood-wink'd by Apocryphal Divines, He owes his Ruin to their damn'd Designs. 'Tis true, they Threatn'd, Flatter'd, Brib'd and Writ But Fools and Women, (which may shew their Wit) Were all the Proselytes they e'er could get: Unless by chance, among the Thoughtless Fry, Some Hireling Pens deserted by the By. All ways to buoy their Sinking Cause they us'd; The Bloodiest, Blackest Methods stood excus'd, If fast to their Design;—which was to do, Ev'n worse than Lewis by his Hugonot Crew; Not pack'd us off for Charity to Roam, But making surer Work, hang'd us like Dogs at Home. Such would have been the Times, we must allow, Had that Persuasion flourish'd here till now: (The Jehu's drove on with a furious Pace, But by their very Swiftness lost the Race:) And such will be the Times and such the Reign, If that curst Doctrin mount the Stage again. We once oblig'd 'em,—and some Authors say We then were thought a duller Race than they, For trusting Wolves, (whose Nature's to devour,) And putting into dang'rous Hands the Reins of Soveraign Power. 'Tis true, we did so;—nor can sorry be, For acting by the Rules of Equity; Possest of all the Glories of a Throne, He was but yet invested in his own. Nor less her self our Loyal Church appears To do her Duty, tho' they fail'd of Theirs. The higher we advanc'd their Wealth and Pow'r, The more our Treatment was Morose and Sour; And cou'd they've found the Means to slake their Thirst, The Arm that rais'd 'em had been Blooded first. If then upon a just Survey, we find Them most ungrateful, when we most were kind; What can w'expect upon the certain Proof W'are not their Friends—but made 'em glare aloof; What milder Dealing can Britannia hope From French Dragoons, and a yet Bloodier Pope, But Fire and Faggot, Poison, Sword and Rope? 'Tis needful then, we here should scan the Man, That would retrieve so bad a Cause again: That cry the BARQUE of State will overwhelm, If the old PILOT come not to the HELM; (He that engag'd us among Rocks and Shelves, Then angry grew we wou'd not Wreck our selves.) That say the CHURCH is tott'ring and will fall, And ah!—You see we are divided all; When they so very far mistake the Point, There's nothing but their Faction out of Joint. Imagine one Man worse than all beside, Made up of Rashness, Virulence and Pride; Imagine him Licencious, False and Vain, His Notions wrested, and his Biass Gain; Conceive him last his Country's Dang'rous Foe, Without one Grain of Reason to be so: Blood his Design, Subversion his Delight, And then you truly paint a Jacobite. A Jacobite! the other French Disease, And more Malignant if we let it seize; For fluxing there relieves the Patient's Pains, But give this Scope, and like a Plague it banes: Of these there are two Sorts;—and one takes Pride To shew what t'other strives as much to hide: But tho' the last demurely Act his Part, 'Tis not for want of Rancour at the Heart; Tho' what he means to do, he does not tell, W'ave fatal Proof he serves the Turn as well: Inveigles, Undermines, Allures, Betrays, And plies his Task a hundred various ways: Sad Times he cries;—then let him have our Curse, That grants 'em wicked, and wou'd make 'em worse. Thus one's a Bigot at full Length display'd, While t'other Skulks about in Masquerade: Yet tho' the first talks loud, and keeps a Pother, He's not so dang'rous as his Silent Brother. What Ward for Arrows flying in the Dark? Or the Sly Cur, that Bites and will not Bark? Such is this Man,—and can he miss the Mark? The Bully boldly shoots the Brothel Door, And mounts the Stairs, Audacious to his Whore; Nor cares to whom the Impious Crime is known, But takes his Turn, and instantly is gone: And tho' the Drab to Truth has no Pretence, He ne'er Disputes her want of Innocence, But Ventures Life and Fortune,—all in its Defence. The secret Leacher, like a Guilty Spright, Ne'er lets his Strumpet see him till 'tis Night; And tho' 'tis Dark will yet be in Disguise, And, Conscious of his Crime, thinks all are Spies. Pray which of these is worst?—I know you'll say, The Private Drudge that ply'd his Task till day, These two Pernicious Monsters paint aright Our Bare-fac'd, and our Vizor'd Jacobite. One is a Papist, careless who does know That he was bred, and will continue so: What e'er He's bid the Implicit Fop will do, Without Examining if false, or true, And so keeps bright Conviction out of view. The other in his Conduct shews you Skill, And is at best but more discreetly ill: What e'er his Brother openly intends, He is for bringing round by Private Ends: (For Your true Rascal must much cunning have Tho' something still of Fool we find in ev'ry Knave:) Will not he is of that Persuasion own, (For little cou'd he serve his Party known:) But, for a Blind declares He's one of Us; And whether so, or not, we'll next discuss. Is He a Protestant that wou'd o'erthrow The Pillars that support his Being so? A Child wou'd have the Answer ready—No. But since so Brief an Answer may not do, We'll take one other Step to prove it too, Tho' needless, since so manifestly true. 'Tis a known Lesson in the Roman School, Who e'er makes one of us Embrace their Rule, From sure Damnation does redeem a Soul. Tho' we see thro' the Lawn of this Pretence, It's want of Truth, of Honesty, and Sense, Yet they run on; Conversion is the Cry, And Peter's Keys are his that will comply. With Truth they never yet one Convert made, But flatter, threaten, or with Gold persuade; Weakness may slip where so much Ice is laid: We saw this Plain; our Chambers ne'er were free From these loose Emp'ricks of Divinitie, Who mixing the Divine Ingredients ill, And worse applying, with that very Pill By which we cure, deprave, insnare and kill: For Christianity (the Scriptures show) Needs not the Crutch of Cruelty to go; She best supports her self; and can aspire To Heav'n, or to an Humble Brest retire, Without the aid of Inquisitions, or a Smithfield Fire These are the gentle Means that Church has took To gain us; Christian Bowels they've forsook, And made a Murd'ring Sword of the Mild Shepherds Crook. Stubborn in Principle, devout in ill, Of Restless Nature, and Licentious Will. The only Reformation they advance Is to turn us from our Allegiance, Or make the Prince assume a Lawless Pow'r, While, sparing only them, He does all else devour: Yet ev'n to Him they their Contempt reveal In making Popes their Earthly last Appeal; Transferring so his Rights to Foreign Hands, For if that Priest but bid, in vain the Prince Commands: Their Soveraigns thus his Properties are made Their Royalties usurp'd, the People's Rights betray'd: For Rome's curs'd Mufti aims but at two things, The Coin from Subjects, and the Pow'r from Kings. The Man that does advance a Popish Reign Wou'd set all these Designs afoot again: All Sense of Human Shame he then must want And have, Seven-fold, a Jesuit's Brazen Front, Who after this concludes himself a Protestant. Either these Men notorious Coxcombs be, Or very firmly think, that—such are we: To bring in Popery, and take off the Test, Yet of th'Establish'd English Church profess'd, Is Inconsistent with all Reasons Rules;— But they are Knaves that wou'd have all be Fools. Some few past Years before your Memory set, And mark if e'er such Contradictions met. Engagements, Vows, and Oaths may once deceive, So far methinks 'tis Human to believe: But He that does Implicitly run on When so much Publick Injury is done, And thinks 'tis for our Safety and our Fame, Must be an Ass,—or else he wants a Name. How strangely is the Papal Herd misled! But what's a Body with so false a Head? To Heav'n the Holy Scriptures point their way, And Truth (a greater Light than rules the Day) Stands for their Guide;—in vain, they will not stir, But follow One that will not follow Her, Yet Impiously assert he cannot Err: Not Err? when in the Eucharist they declare The Flesh that Suffer'd on the Cross is there? That tho' we Bread to outward Seeming see, 'Tis yet th'intire Essential Deitie? No not at all;—nay further (adds the Priest) 'Tis but with Fools that Miracles are ceas'd: Our Sons will give, (and Credit rightly Plac'd,) More Faith ev'n to their Teachers, than their Tast. So the Good Woman, tho' her Husband saw Her in the Fact, not valu'd it a Straw; But cry'd, at once to end all future Strife, What? trust your Eyes before your nown Sweet Wife? But to return: Suppose the Man we here Have mention'd, really no Papist were, He shou'd be ne'er a Jot the less our Fear; Since all his Actions to their Centre tend, As fierce an Enemy, as false a Friend. Were I seiz'd by two Ruffians strong and bold, And one does cut my Throat, and t'other hold, Or gag me, while he perpetrates the Act; Which of the two is guilty of the Fact? Why thus, e'en handy dandy chuse you whether, For Law will tell you both must hang together. Well then, if not a Protestant, (as we Have cause to doubt) 'tis proper now to see Of whence, and what Communion He can be. —Not a Fanatick; they his Converse shun, And fast enough to Wickedness can run, Without th'Encouragement of Looing on: Not but thus far we ought to Right their Fame, The Jesuit 'tis, that finds and springs their Game. Tho' here he can't devour so much as they, He yet fills up their Cry, and shoots them at their Prey. —Nor must he be a Quaker understood; For 'tho' their bad, he yet is not so Good: Prepost'rously they both Religion ply; Those make it Farce, and these a Tragedy. —Nor is he Baptist, Dryden's Bristl'd Boar, Who tho' in Germany his Tusks he tore, His Friends have deeper dip'd their Hands in Christian Gore: In Piedmont was their Restless Fury try'd, In Ireland too, their Butch'ry rag'd as wide Nor only there, but half the World beside: O blest Religion! sure to gain the Heart, That wou'dst with Blood and Massacre convert! Booted Apostles thy Converters are, But, Search the Scriptures, find such Monsters there. —Nor is he Turk or Jew—but if we scan Him Rightly, a much more opprobrious Man; His Kings and Countreys Traytor, so profess'd, As he supports the Gallick Interest: And who advances that (to name him right) Must bear the odious Brand of Jacobite, And next a Papist; half an Eye may see Two Tallies more exactly can't agree, Than now a Murm'ring Tongue with Popery. A Papist to the Common-Weal's a Foe, By Interest, Nature, and by Doctrine so; That Common Foe a Villain we may write; Of that Communion is a JACOBITE. 'Tis time to rouze our Selves, nor longer lie In the cold Bosom of Indifferency, While, careless of what Times are comming on, That Danger seize us which we yet may shun; For Laughter, Laziness, and Luke-warm Zeal, Are but weak Mail to keep out Popish Steel. Who e'er stands Neuter now is doubly base, Springs from a Traytor's or a Coward's Race, Thoughtless of Shame and harden'd in Disgrace. In our Defence half Europe are in Arms, And all our Enemies have took th'Alarms; Unanimous as One, then, let us go, And not be sought but let us seek the Foe: Our Cause is ripe and Justice is our own; Freed from our Bondage, let th'Egyptian Groan. And that to this Great Work we may be gone The sooner, think Great William leads us on: Nurs'd up in War ev'n from his tender Years, As fam'd for Conduct as contempt of Fears; On that sure Basis he his Glory rears. A Prince whose Vict'ries we with Wonder view, And ev'ry Day gives Birth, or Teems with new. Not a vain Promiser that breaks his Word, But of a Temper Constant as his Sword; H'has sav'd two Kingdoms and shall save the Third; Nor then the Just, the needful War give o'er, But, that Reduc'd, go on and Conquer more. France then, perhaps, tho' now her Airy Pride, Wrapt in the Clouds, her Tyrant's Head do's hide, May tumble down, and such a Time behold As Edward and our Henry shew'd of old, When in that Countries Bowels they did draw Their Conq'ring Swords, and gave its Members Law. 'Tis done!—I see 'em Fly, and Dye, and Yield, As then they did at Crescy's Fatal Field. Our Courage and our Strength are still the same, And God-like William as Renown'd a Name, And stands as fair for Everlasting Fame! A SATYR AGAINST MAN. TO The Right Honourable CHARLES, Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, &amp;c. The First Part. I who against the Women drew my Pen, With equal Fury now attack the Men: The Charming Sex, that thought us then Severe, Shall find we'll be alike Impartial here; That no Regard shall to our Side be shown, From Him that clouts a Shooe to Lewis on a Throne. Ye Injur'd Spirits of that Virgin Train Who by unfaithful Lovers once were slain, Cropt from your Stalks like Roses newly blown, With all your Beauties, all your Sweetness on! In vain the Nymph was faithful to her Mate, Your Truth cou'd not Protect you from your Fate; Your Truth, too cold to melt th'Obdurate Mind Of Man, whose Nature is to be unkind: If you, Chast Shades, e'er condescend to know, Enthron'd above, what Mortals do below; If still You can your Earthly Wrongs resent, And wish the Perjur'd lasting Punishment, Assist the Muse in her Revengeful Flight; Lend her but Rage, and she shall do you Right. Man is my Theme,—but where shall I begin, Where enter the vast Circle of his Sin? Or how shall I get out when once I'm in? Man! who by Heav'n was made to govern all, But how unfit demonstrates in his Fall: Created pure, and with a Strength endu'd Of Grace Divine, sufficient to have stood; But Alienate from God, he soon became The Child of Wrath, of Mise'ry, Pride and Shame. What Beast beside can we so slavish call As Man? who yet pretends he's Lord of all: Who ever saw (and all their Classes cull) A Dog so snarlish, or a Swine so full, A Wolf so rav'nous, or an Ass so dull? What Species of 'em have so far been shamm'd To think their other Brethren all are damn'd. So short his Judgment, and so dim his Eye, He's farthest off when he believes he's nigh. Pretends to Heav'n your Footsteps to convey As by and by we'll more at large display; Then raises Mists to make you lose your Way. But most the Women his Discourse deceives; For ever lost the Female that believes! Assist ye injur'd Maids, the Muses Flight, Lend her but Rage, and she shall do you Right. Slave to his Passions, ev'ry sev'ral Lust Whisks him about, as Whirlwinds do the Dust: And Dust he is indeed, a senseless Clod, That swells, and wou'd be yet believ'd a God. When e'er in his Gilt Coach the Pageant rides, (Full of himself, and loathing all besides,) He must be thought Illustrious, Wise and Brave, Tho' a known Coxcomb, and a fearful Slave. Mean while the Man of Worth, with all his Care, Shall scarce have Money, in a hazy Air, To pay the jolting Hackney Coach its Fare. This shews us Fortune in her Partial Mood, Is chiefly most unkind, where least she shou'd; To Merit false, as if 'twere made a Rule, But faithful as a Saint to Knave and Fool. Good Heav'n! that such should have so little Sense, And yet withal so much of Impudence, To think their Value higher than the rest, For swearing loud, and being nicelier dress'd; Yet so it is, the flutt'ring Coxcomb's priz'd, And the brave threadbare gen'rous Soul despis'd. The Vertuous Woman too is grown their Jest, And Heav'n, and Heavenly Things belov'd the least. But aid, ye shining Train! the Satyr's Spite, Lend her but Rage, and she shall do you Right. Where'er Self-Interest calls, he's sure to go, But never matters whether Just, or no: Justice he laughs at as an Idle Tye, Lives in that Faith, and so resolves to Dye. As greater Fish upon the weaker prey, As Wolves on Sheep, that from their Shepherd stray, So Cruel Men, with utmost Rage and Spite, Make Violence and Rapine their Delight, Till with Revenge they've gorg'd the Appetite. Not bounded by Divine or Human Law, Too Proud to Humble, and too Strong to Awe; Breaking the Bars, that Natures Hand has laid, All Wrong they cherish, and all Right invade. New Worlds of Vice he daily does explore; His Sea of Villany's without a Shore. Ev'n in his Dreams, he's laying Snares for Blood, And waking, he resolves to make 'em good: Or grant, against his Treach'ry you provide, It is but having Money on their Side, And soon the Case 'twill to their Biass draw; Corrupts the Judge, and he Corrupts the Law. Witness the present Legislative Train, Where for one Wise, you have your fifty vain, And for one Just, a hundred following Gain. Witness the Crew, that late exulting stood, And wash'd their Impious Hands in Royal Blood: If from their Subjects Princes are not free, What must the Wretch expect of mean Degree? Not in an Age he sees a happy Hour, For Poverty is still the Slave of Pow'r; And oft to satisfie the Tyrants Lust, Is forc'd to bend, and crawl, and lick the Dust: The Fair themselves meet with a Fate as course, And those of 'em it can't betray 'twill force. Assist, ye Injur'd Maids, the Muses Flight, Lend her but Rage, and she shall do you Right. Deceitful, Slothful, Covetous and Base; Rage in his Heart, yet Peace upon his Face. Whene'er he smiles the specious Cheat beware, Some secret Villany lies lurking there; Which if it take, (to Lucifer ally'd) Makes him but Sport for his Revenge and Pride. Nor are but Fools deceiv'd by the Disguise, It reaches for above them, to the Wise: Nay ev'n the Learn'd are often Knaves for Hire, And whither then can Innocence retire? Friendship, which gain'd of Old Immortal Fame, Is now, like Justice, nothing but a Name. Who calls you Friend avoid, unless you know By uncontested Proof he has been so: In that Disguise the Blackest Deeds are done, In that Disguise they're hardest, too, to shun. Who is it makes the Modest Wife a Whore? Your Friend, for those that hate you shun your Door. Who is it proves to Oaths and Bonds injust? Your Friend, Your Enemies you never trust; Or, if you do, y'are very far from Wise; And Knave and Fool we equally Despise. Who is it does your secret Soul betray, And bring your darkest Thoughts to open Day? Who is but your Friend? in whose false Breast You vainly thought they wou'd for ever rest. The Heart of Man is to it self untrue, And why shou'd you expect it Just to You? Friendships, at best, are but like Brush-wood fire, Shine bright a while, and in a Blaze expire: Ev'n Love it self is now a Flame decay'd; For whatsoe'er is to the Female said, It is the Fortune charms, and not the Maid. Assist, ye Injur'd Train, the Satyr's spite, Lend her but Rage, and she shall do you Right. Who most does Promise least shou'd be believ'd, For first to trust is next to be deceiv'd. I once my self believ'd I had a Friend, For boundless was the Love he did pretend: Riches he did not want, he rowl'd in Coin, Which oft he Swore was less his own than Mine. He wou'd do Nothing without my Advice, Friendships best sign; for no true Friend is Nice: I too ador'd him with so bright a Flame, Angel to Angel can but do the same. At his approach all other Joys took flight, Ev'n Woman I contemn'd; he was the Light That rul'd the Day, they did but rule the Night; And that too oft:—upon his gentle Breast My Cares, and ev'ry Anxious Thought took rest. It happen'd once my Purse was low in Store; (And once were well if 'twou'd be so no more:) In this Affliction 'twas no slender Bliss I was assur'd of such a Friend as this. On Him, said I, on Him I may depend, I cannot need so much as He will lend; He will be thankful his Esteem is try'd,— I ask'd him, and, by Heav'n, I was deny'd! Nor ever since will he so much as Greet, Or Speak, or Nod, or Name me when we Meet, But like a Friend, ascance he Darts his Eye, Or with proud Gesture walks regardless by. Traytor to Friendship! may thy Spoted Name Stand branded here with everlasting Shame. But 'tis no Wonder; search, and You will find The same Ill Nature runs thro' Humankind. Not Madmen when they're in the Raving fit, Reciting Bards, (a Race more frantick yet,) Or Atheists, that will have Prophaneness Wit; Not Midnight Drunkards scow'ring thro' the Street, With Swords advanc'd to Stab the next they meet, Nor ought be it as horrid as it can. Is more avoided than the Borrowing Man. In vain the Widow does Assistance crave; The Virgin can herself no Pity have, But once in want, must Whore for Bread, or find a timeless Grave. But aid, ye Injur'd Sex, the Muses Flight, Lend her but Rage and she shall do you Right. Not that by this I'd have You prone to lend, Unless You are sure 'tis to a Real Friend; If you doubt that, in vain he shou'd intreat, The Business of Mankind's to Lye and Cheat: Why then shou'd any be so vain to trust When 'tis such odds the Debtor proves unjust. A Friend's a Friend, and so he shou'd be us'd; But where one finds 'em Just, ten Thousand are abus'd. The Vows of Men are of the Brittlest kind, And light as Chaff dispers'd before the Wind; But made in Sport, and lengthen'd to be Weak; As Children's Bubbles just are blown to break. How far their Words are distant from the Heart, And then how black in the Ingrateful Part The Fair can best inform, who most have felt the Smart. What Female has there ever yet been known That found, by Proof, her Lover all her own? Much for Inconstancy that Sex is fam'd, But now in their own Mother-Art they're sham'd: Swifter than they the Swain can change his Mind, And most be faithless where they most are kind. So vastly wide his Language and Design, He thinks they're Devils whom he calls Divine. Knows he is Treach'rous yet will swear He's true, And, which is worse, call Heav'n to vouch it too: But 'tis all Lust, spoke when his Blood is warm, And the next Face he fancies ends the Charm. Assist, ye Injur'd Maids, the Satyr's Spite, Lend her but Rage, and she shall do You Right. No Vice so distant but within his view, Nor Crime so horrid, which he dares not do. Treason's a Trifle; 'tis a frequent thing To here the Subject, speaking of his King, Use viler Terms than Tinkers in their Ale, Throw on a Trull, too Liberal of her Tail. Adult'ry but a Ve'nial Slip, no more, Now grown a Trade, what e'er 'twas heretofore; For some there are (O where is Vertue fled! O strange Perversion of the Nuptial Bed!) Who that way Nightly toil to get their Daily Bread. Murder and Pox so common, none can be Admitted Gentleman of Prime Degree, Till he has thrice been Clap't and Butcher'd Three. Incest but laugh'd at as a Pleasant Jest; A Sister now as Gr?y has oft confess'd, Is e'en as Good a Morsel as the best. Others, with equal boldness, strip the Lead From Sepulchres, and Robb the very Dead: Nay, some the Plate have from the Altar bore. In which they had Receiv'd but just before. In short so much their Violence prevails, Our Churches must be made as strong as Jails. But You'll object that Persons so inclin'd Are Scoundrels, and the Fagg of Humankind: Search then the Roads; and You will quickly see What we may hope from Rascals of Degree: A Noble Birth makes but the vitious worse, And their last Shift is certainly—the Purse: Extravagantly having spent their own, They're all for Spoil and Rapine when 'tis gone. Villains! that strip the Needy Peasant bare, Tho' what he had he got with Toil and Care; That Ravish helpless Woman, barbarous Act! And next Destroy 'em to conceal the Fact. But what they lightly get they spend as fast, Their Lives in dissolute Embraces wast, Till they are caught, adjudg'd, their Crimes confess'd, And then unpitied die;—and so die all the rest. Go on, my Satyr, and indulge thy Rage, For never was a more Licentious Age. Happy our brave Progenitors of old; What they call Brass, was sure an Age of Gold; When Man by Active Games was hardy made, And War believ'd an Honourable Trade; Not made as now, Religion the Pretence, To shew our Goodness equal with our Sense: They fought for Glory, and we fight for Shame; Our Feud's the Scandal of the Christian Name. Thro' Hills they hew'd and div'd thro' Seas of Blood, But all their Toils were for their Countrys Good. What ever Care was for their Interest shown, They still preferr'd the Publick to their own. Factions then strove not to subvert the State, As they do now, and as they've done of late, They were not Plagu'd with Jealousies and Fears, A Priest cou'd not set Nations by the Ears: Nor ever was that Method to 'em known Which in these latter Times so oft is shown, Of fighting for Religion till they'd none. Thus Honour, Truth, and Justice were their aim; Their Sons saw this, and follow'd them to Fame. Quite contrary, our Youths are only made Harpies of Law, or Prentices to Trade; Where each of 'em his Term of Years compleats, To come out last the more accomplish'd Cheats. Seven Seasons thus Preposterously are spent, (Their Fathers, Masters, and their own Intent,) To make one Lye, and 'tother Impudent, Send 'em, ye Senseless Sires, against the Turk, 'Tis now the Time, and Meritorious Work; It is a Glorious Cause, and let 'em Roam; Be Judge Your selves which is the Nobler doom, To fight for Truth abroad, or damn'd for Lyes at home. Along my Muse, and yet indulge your Rage, For never was a more Flagitious Age. But Trade, You'll say, ought not to be despis'd, So much by wisest Legislators Priz'd: Whole Millions it employs, who else wou'd know What strength they had, and into Factions grow; No other set of Brutes being half so rude, As your Pretended Christian Multitude. Beside, by Trade vast Cities thrive and rise With Monuments and Tow'rs, contiguous to the Skies. They do indeed; and we may know as well 'Tis Riches makes 'em Murmur and Rebel. Those Crowds whom You pretend their Trade deterrs From lanching into Civil Strife and Jars Make that the Cause of all Intestine Harms; For 'tis their Chief Pretence to take up Arms: If they grow Poor with one Resol'v'd Consent, (Like those who do their Wisdoms represent,) They lay the Fault upon the Government; When after all their Clamor, Spite and Pother, Tis playing their false Dice with one another, For still the half that fattens starves the other. But let the Mildest Sense be understood, That Trade was meant and proves for Publick Good; What Comfort, or Excuse can it obtain For Him that is a Private Rogue for Gain? In Gross, or in Retail, for both Lines meet And make this Truth their Centre Trades a Cheat. What difference can there be between the Man That cuts my Throat, and who does all he can By Specious Guile to take my Bread away, And Less'ning it a Morsell ev'ry Day? Which is but Killing a more Cruel Way: Doubtless, tho' 'tother seems the more accurst, The secret Trading Villain is the worst. So of Religion, the bold Atheist, who Talks as he thinks, tho' Impious and untrue, Is better than the Hypocrite, whose Zeal Is but a Cloak his Lusts and Murders to conceal. But on my Satyr with a Furies Rage, For never was a more Enormous Age. And here I must with Indignation show What Ill from Seeming Sanctity does flow: Wou'd You be something of Superior Rate Look big, and be distinguish'd by the State? Wou'd You be follow'd more than Lob or Pen? (The dullest that, and this the worst of Men) Be always Canting: 'tis a sure Disguise That cheats not only Fools, but reaches to the Wise: Tho' when advanc'd You need no further go, But lie as still as those that have been so: 'Tis very few can tell, with all their Care, The Ease and Quiet of an Elders Chair. Do You for secret Profit lie in wait? As being Trustee of some large Estate? Erect your Eyes, and feign a mien Devout, And from a Thousand they shall pick you out; Leave to your Management the whole Affair, Which is, in short, the Ruin of the Heir. Are You a Scholar? nay or are you not, And wou'd have something very quickly got? Put on a Gown, and go with Looks demure To Bawds, or Burgesses, that ev'ry Hour Expect the King of Terrors in his Pow'r: Creatures whose Penitence is only fear; For, had they Health, they'd soon be as they were: Go but to these with Fluency of Cant, Be Impudent withall (a Gift we grant, Which your Religious Strowlers seldom want;) Their Hearts shall Yern, and drop you Golden Ore, While their poor Neighbours Perish at the Door. In short there's nothing, be it ne'er so Ill, To Cheat, Forswear, to Ravish, Burn, or Kill, But if 'tis veil'd with a Fanatick dress, Is thought by some the top of Godliness: Not Hell it self contains sufficient Fire For Teachers who such Principles inspire. But that the God of Truth we plainly find In shining Strokes imprinted on the Mind; And that his Word asserts, with due regard He'll scourge the Bad, and give the Good reward, So many Errors has Religion shown, And it's Professors so Irreverent grown, I shou'd ev'n think Him happiest that had none. Proceed, my Satyr, with a Furies Rage For never was a more Notorious Age. Go to the Country, if You think to see The old and so renown'd Simplicity, A Temperate sort of Men, compos'd and Wise, That joyn with Truth, and all Excess despise, You'll be deceiv'd; for You shall quickly think Both Poor and Rich were all Baptiz'd in Drink. Eternal Sots! when the Brown Bowl's in use, Y'ad better meet a Baited Bear broke loose. Then for Tobacco, ev'ry Ale-house there Wou'd suffocate ten Coffee-houses here! A Stupid, Obstinate, Illite'rate Race, Molded in hast, and Men to their disgrace. The Yeomanry they boast are much the same, Nor answer the Composure of their Frame, But have of Human nothing but the Name. Sermons they fly, or if by chance, they hear, They truely might as well have stop't the Ear, And Edify'd at Plough as much as there: No least delight there in their Bosom Springs Of Truth and Peace, of Heav'n and Holy Things; A Treach'rous sort of Men demure in Sin, The out-side Shepherd, and all Wolf within. But if the Bumkin we no more admire, What must we think that viler thing—a Squire? The Country Beau, who fancies none so great As those, possess'd of nothing—but Estate. Let wiser Men abroad for Polish roam; His business is—to be an Ass at home. Bar him from talking but of Dog and Horse, He's totally depriv'd of all Discourse. As 'tother Triumphs at the rise of Corn, So all his Glory is the Hound and Horn; Away upon the Scent they scow'ring go, Thro' thick and thin, and over high and low; Where e'er the Fox does fly the Fools pursue. Oblig'd so little to the Heads they wear, A breaking Neck is not at all their care; Till dislocated Bones at length convince They're Cripples in their Limbs, as well as Sense: But tho' this Way the Sire is half undone, It has at all no Influence on the Son, Who thinking Daddy what we Lordly call, Drinks, Whores, and Hunts till he has wasted all, So goes th'Estate by over-reaching got, Rais'd by a Knave, and squander'd by a Sot. Justly the Satyr may indulge her Rage. For never was a more Licentious Age. Such Vices on a Rural Stage to find Does bring the Monster London to my Mind; If Wickedness is grown so Prosp'rous there, To what a Pitch must it arrive at here! Where, from the Lofty Stand, we have a View Of ev'ry Villany that Man can do, An Abstract of all Evils, Old and New; A Fund Immense! that won't Exhausted be Till Time has shot the Gulf of round Eternitie. All Crimes of Men and Devils here abound, And none so bad but have Protection found. The Soil so Rank, no Vice but what does bear, Nor dully waits for Rip'ning half the Year, But ev'ry Moment shoots a Harvest here. To tell 'em singly were a Task as vain As in a Shower to count the Drops of Rain; But shou'd a serious Man but truly mark The Guilt of ev'ry Bully, ev'ry Spark; Wou'd he Survey their Treach'ry, Oaths and Pride, A Devil Worship'd, and a God defy'd; Their Blasphemies, their Murders and Amours, Lewd City Wives, and stinking Suburb Whores; Pimps, Pois'ners, Panders, and Luxurious Lords, With Judges damn'd upon their own Records; In Courts of Justice little Justice had, Knights of the Post, and other Knights as bad: Shou'd he these Monsters see, and Thousands more Of all Degrees; Great, Little Rich and Poor, What cou'd he think? what cou'd he thence deduce But Sodom was Reviv'd or Hell broke loose? His Hair with Horror Stiffn'd, he wou'd say We Merited the Flames as much as they, And that the Devils went before but to prepare our Way. Lash on my Satyr with a Furies Rage, For never was a more Flagitious Age. Expos'd to Times of such Impietie, Whether for Succour can the Vertuous flee? Where can they fix their Feet to compass rest? How save themselves? or comfort the distress'd? Severe to Human thinking, is the Fate That upon Patience, Truth and Justice wait: Dare to be Honest and You'll quickly find Y'are beating Chaff, and Labouring for the Wind: But don't Repine; there must be Joys in store For Him that can at once be Just and Poor: 'Tis true he does not lie on Beds of Down, Nor with a Set of Flanders beats the Town; Keeps not a Cast of Lackques, to declare To Punks his Vanity, and Pimps his Fear; Drinks not the choicest Wines, nor does he eat The most delicious, or most Costly meat; Keeps not French Cooks to chatter at the Poor, First cram'd by them, then empty'd by his Whore: But tho' his own he can't these Trifles call, He has a Blessing that out-weighs 'em all, An Unmolested Conscience, void of stain, Which Greatness, and which Wealth can never gain; In vain they'd think there is no Future State, They feel their Load of Sins and sink beneath the Weight: While Honest Men—but whether do I Steer? Why talk of Honesty?—a thing so rare! So seldom thought of, and in Bulk so small, 'Tis Doubtful if it does exist at all, Search thro' the Nation, find me if you can, That Prodigy, a Truely Honest Man; Let me but see him, let me know his Name, And it shall be the whole Discourse of Fame: In the mean time, till such a one is found, (And he that Searches must not spare for Ground) Justly the Muse might lash the Impious Age, And with like Fury fill the following Page, But that we here must Mitigate her Rage: From change of Precepts fresh Instruction springs; Here then a while she stoops her weary Wings, To talk more coolly of some Nicer Things. The Second Part. Having thus far of Man in General Penn'd We'll now to some Particulars descend; To things wherein he most himself does prize; His Wit, and Learning, Stript of their Disguise, And see if those will yet confirm him Wise. Who e'er the Top of Infamy wou'd gain Must be a Wit—perverted at the Brain: But that we may the Monster undisguise We'll first, (as in the Scale of Truth it lies,) Lay open what a Modern Wit implies. An Impious Wretch that Scripture ridicules, And thinks the Men that dare not do it, Fools. A Lustful Goat! who to be fully known For what he is, does pick and cull the Town For Maids and Wives—first having Pox't his Own. If Liberal, it is only in his Wine; So that his Bounty's Chance, and not Design. His Mannors he does make th'Attornies Care, To Rack the Tenant and to Rob the Heir; And in the Course of Years, to make two Thirds their Share. Fond of bad Notions, which he oft will strain With such an Impious Subtilty of Brain, The Thread at last his Reaso'ning does produce Is spun so Ill, 'tis of no Human Use; But Intricately cross'd with Lines and Snares To Ruin Souls; as Spiders, Flies with Theirs. In Scoffs upon Religion seldom dull; Forgeting Sense deprav'd but makes the greater Fool. His Faith does with the Turkish Creed comply, Which owns a God, but lays a Saviour by; So following Arrius, who the Dance began, He makes the Great Redeemer less than Man. But that we may his Character comprize In a few Words, his Talent chiefly lies In crying down the Christian Mysteries: With Him the Passion's but a Tale of Course, The Trinity a Contradiction Worse; Th'Incarnate God the Cobweb of the Schools, And rising from the Dead the Dream of Fools: This is the Wit that makes our Gentry Mad; And there's a Bastard Sort almost as bad, Which in the Meaner Rout it self displays, And does exert its Pow'er a Thousand various ways. In Fools it is the finding Fau't with Sense, In Courtiers Craft, in Lawyers Impudence; In Beaus it is to Dress, to Patch and Paint, In Porters Bawdry, and in Misers Want; In Poets Flatt'ry, in the Clergy Pride, In Schismaticks 'tis an unerring Guide, And Rapine, Spite, Revenge, in all Mankind beside. When all the while the thing it self's no more Than a true turn of Thought, not heard before; A Flash of Sense that darts into the Mind, Like Starling weighty, yet like that refin'd, Good Language, Breeding, Vertue, all in one Expression joyn'd. These three away, whatever Fools profess, It is no longer Wit, but Wickedness. Thus chew these Men on Husks instead of Fruit; And tho' of Reason, Reason they dispute, They yet let Instinct better guide the Brute. His Learning 'twill be needless to expose, As having little Credit there to lose; And then, the more his Boast the less he knows. The Face of Heav'n with Constellations, Signs, Ecliptick, and a thousand various Lines He Scribbles o'er, and to the Stars does give A Pow'r by which we either Die, or Live: But if so vast an Influence they instill As to be found Superior to the Will, We can our selves be neither Good or Ill: And what Absurdities arise from thence A Child may tell without the help of Sense. Nor less does the Predicting Coxcomb call From Man Contempt; and from the Satyr, Gall; Who Insolently in those Leaves wou'd look Where only God does write, and Fate it self's the Book: 'Tis He! th'Almighty! and 'tis only He Has Eyes that pierce into Futurity. And yet our Nostradamus's presume With Senseless Schemes to tell of Things to come; When their vain Art there's nothing represents So near, as Madmen guessing at Events. Tho' ev'ry Year convinc'd of Judging wrong, Yet with a frontless Look, and lying Tongue They still go on, and from the harmless Stars Fetch Claps and Famine, Duels, Debts and Wars. Others their Time in Elegance employ, The Choice of Words and Phrase their only Joy; Some they Improve, and others Introduce, And both, perhaps, a while remain in Use; Till Time, that does all Human Change compleat, Takes in more New, and makes them Obsolete. Chaucer but in his Matter lives alone, The Sweetness of his Matchless Stile is gone. Thus, thoughtless of the Future on they Post And ply the Critick till the Christian's lost. Nor less in History does his Judgment err Perverting Fact, that Truth wou'd render Clear. Whatever from him else his Reader draws He finds; at least He's Faithful to his Cause: How many Hireling Pens does Lewis fee To cheat and Misinform Posterity! A true Impartial Author who can Name Since Greatness has with Pensions truck'd for Fame? How many are there at this Instant known, That will to Future Times be Hero's shown, Yet are but Sots and Villains in their own? Or grant he Philosophically spends His Time, and Nature faithfully attends; Nature! whose wilie Lab'rinth never Ends. Or be it Physick that employs his Days, Or Metaphysicks yet more wand'ring Maze; Or shou'd he on to Alchymy aspire, And all the Transmutations wrought by Fire, The Satisfaction can be yet but dry; One Point obtain'd another's in his Eye; Another after that; another still Succeeds, to teaze and baffle Human Skill. To Numbers an Infinity we give, But shou'd we for no other Purpose live But to count on, and wast our Little Span In Searches Unattainable by Man, Whatever Doctrin's current in the Schools, 'Twou'd still appear we liv'd and dy'd like Fools. Thus tho' of Reason daily we dispute, We yet let Instinct better Guide the Brute. But Him that positively Fool we call Is He that reads, chain'd with 'em to the Stall, All Authors, and is for digesting all; When Life it self's not able to attain Any one Part of any Science plain. Of Universal Scholar much we hear, But 'tis a Sound so shocking to the Ear, The Men of Judgment humbler with their Lot, Retort more truly—Universal Sot! When in his Study, where that Term he gains, How does he work his Thought, and froth his Brains, His Leisure Squander, and his Spirits wast, To bring out some Abortive Cub at last? Or if, by Chance, if does with Life escape, Whole Years are spent in licking it to Shape: Tho' after all, perhaps, it's utmost Date Is one Edition, and it yields to Fate. But Nothing can in Nature better paint This Poring Scholar, or this Dreaming Saint, Than when we see his Servant, wild in Looks, With a large Fox-Tail dusting of his Books; His Face is soil'd; and as his Work he plies The more the Feathers, filth, and Atoms rise, Till he's at last depriv'd ev'n of the Use of Eyes. Just so his Master (as the Man has been Without) is serv'd for raising Dust within: A Thousand Tenets madly he'll maintain, A Thousand more are whirling in his Brain: From Shelf to Shelf the Bandy'd Books are thrown; Confronting still their Notions with his own, Till losing in a Mist all inward Light, His Senses clog just like Servants Sight. In short and let him be examin'd thro' His Antient Authors, and with them his New; In all that he has Common-Plac'd, for Use, Advantage, Pride, Instruction, or Abuse; And see if, after all his Life he Squares Much better than your Vulgar Blockheads, theirs. He talks, perhaps, more freely off at Hand, But in such Jargon few can understand, A barbarous Mixture, took from ev'ry Tongue, To make up one Ridicuously wrong; A Patch'd and Py-bald Idiom, rent and torn, The Pedants Glory, but the Poets Scorn. Beside, what is it from his Learning Springs That mends his Management in Moral Things? Can he than others more of Truth maintain? Has he his Passions faster in the Rein? Or is he less a Slave to sordid Gain? Is he to Temperance known a faster Friend? Or less Resolv'd for Trifles to contend? Is he (at once) to Vertue more Inclin'd? Or does he follow less the fatal Kind? But that we may in Little all comprize;— Were he ten Lives allow'd the Use of Eyes He'd read, and read,—but never yet be Wise; Nay rather far (bred up in Hobs's School, Wou'd prove at last, by Section and by Rule, An Atheist—that Compleat and finish'd Fool! Thus tho' of Reason daily he'll dispute, He yet lets Instinct better guide the Brute. But here you'll say, misled by Human Pride, What? must all Learning then be laid aside? Yes all I say that leads into Abuse, For Prejudice and Spite have no Excuse;— But not that sort which is of Heav'nly Use. Such as to search the Scriptures, and from thence To build our Hope on God's Omnipotence; That God which to our Dust did Being give, And turn'd to Dust again, again shall make it live: Why shou'd the Resurrection cause Debate When to Restore is less than to Create? To own his Son, the Great Messiah, sent Our everlasting Ruin to prevent And by this easie Method—only to Repent. This is the Learning we shou'd all pursue, Nor only Learning—it is WISDOM too! But for that Wisdom which we Worldly call, 'Tis Fraud, Pretence, Design, and Treach'ry all; While following Lust, or Gain, w'are in a Maze Of Errors whirl'd a thousand different ways: These in the Chase of War believe it lies, That thinks 'tis only found in Ladies Eyes; This at the Bar the Empty Glare pursues, While Sots in Taverns think 'tis Wine and News: Some in the Court, which nothing else employs: Wou'd have it to consist in Dress and Noise, In lies, Grimace, and thinking all Disgrace Beneath a Blockhead of Illustrious Race. Others believe this Wisdom to pursue, Their being singly Wicked will not do, So Goad on others to Damnation too. Advice, Example, nay Rewards are us'd And Bribes for Sin are seldom known refus'd. In vain the Prince of Hell his Envoys sends We do his Work much faster than his Fiends. Thus tho' of Reason, Reason we dispute, We yet let Instinct better guide the Brute. But here th'Objector does again oppose— In vain her Spleen your Wrested Satyr shows; For Man as much he sees, so much he knows: What if some few to Scepticism fall? We for their Errors must not strike at all. As high as Heav'n his lofty Search he bends, Then down to Lowest Hell the Line extends, And his pursuit of Knowledge never ends. Into his Mind he vast Idea's takes, And thro' all Arts as vast a Progress makes; His reach of Thought and Intellectuals fit For all Attempts of Wisdom and of Wit. Such FACULTIES wou'd Heav'n to Man produce And then Maliciously forbid their USE? Look all around; be FLEETS or TOWNS the Scene, Or Stately Fabricks, or some vast Machine, In all his Noble Works his Ample Soul is seen. What a hard Task has he that wou'd convince A Fool he is deficient in his Sense? All sorts of Knowledge, properly of use, Deserve our Praise, and plead their own Excuse. But for his Navies and their fatal Sound, If we examine Christendom around, The Land does scarce secure so much as they confound. Then for his Cities who did ever rear So much as One without all Vices there? Better if yet we wild in Woods did roam. Made some cool Shades, or silent Cave our home, Than growing by Society refin'd Disgrace, Burlesque, and Ridicule our Kind. As for the Spacious Fabrick that employs So many Men,—this Builds and that Enjoys. 'Tis matter still of Fact, nor needs Dispute, Who Labours most does least enjoy the Fruit, A Curse that God does justly on us throw For fixing all our Hope on Things below. As for his Science in it's Noblest Flight, We have already weigh'd, and found it Light. Then for his Mind, Capacious tho' it be, 'Tis all a Desart wanting Piety. And last of all, what with his Boasted Eye Can he inform us of the Worlds on high, On which we may with certainty rely? What is it that supplies the Sun with Flame, Which, still exhausting still remains the same? How did the Seeds of Things at first disperse? And—LET IT BE—Create an Universe? Or if this seem too high, what does he know Of Nature in her Num'rous Forms below? Who ever gave of all that yet have been, A true Solution but—why Grass is Green? What Glorious Pencil does the Colours lay When Beaute'ous Flora breaths her Sweets on May? Then for himself—how Soul and Body's joyn'd, This limitted, and 'tother unconfin'd, Is an Ænigma Man cou'd ne'er unbind. What secret Cavern, most divinely wrought, Contains th'unbounded Images of Thought? Where does th'Immortal Mind in Sleep retire? Whence has the Eye its Sight, and Life its Fire? How do the seve'ral Senses inward rowl, And find their wond'rous Passage to the Soul? If Ignorant then of these, and ev'ry thing Almost beside, whence can the boldness Spring, That, with Conceptions Finite, he wou'd stretch Where but Infinity, it Self can Reach? And Measure by vain Notions, here Imbib'd, Th'Immeasurable! God uncircumscrib'd! Eternity, and so Omnipotence, Are things Inscrutable to Human Sense. The only surest thing that here we know, Is that we were not once in such a State as now; And that we are not now what we shall be Hereafter—Lanch'd into Eternity: Enough alone to make the boldest here Believe Salvation worth his strictest Care. But against Natural Light we close our Eyes, Then greatest Fools, when most we think w'are wise. Thus tho' of Reason, Reason we dispute, We yet let Instinct better Guide the Brute. But then (to such Perverse Extremes we go) As these wou'd know all things, so some will nothing know. Why shou'd vain Man, they cry, the Greatest Beast, Believe his Essence nobler than the rest? What tho', he high as Heav'n erect can view? So, when he Pleases can a Monkey too; That Animal, whom, if we nicely scan; Has most of Brute as nearest Copying Man. Search all the Savage Kind both Bulls and Bears, And find me one perplext with future Fears. If in some things (tho' 'tis but oft Pretence) We have th'Advantage, Cloathing and Defence, They yet exceed Mankind in ev'ry Sense: This Common Fate, at least, to both is known, We Propagate our Species and are gone: Alike by Nature form'd; and 'tis as true We ought, with them, to live by Nature too: The Faculties we have she bids us use, And not Obeying, we her Laws abuse. In short, we nothing more than Brutes can tell Either of doing Ill, or doing Well; Nor shall hereafter (as 'twill then appear) No more than they be blam'd for ought committed here: The Whips, the Furies, and Eternal Flames Have all their Substance meerly in their Names. 'Twere most absurd to think th'Almighty heeds Our Idle, Thoughtless, Casual, Senseless Deeds. Why shou'd he with such Rage our Race pursue Who do but what we cannot chuse to do? Suppose a Man that never saw the Light, But from his Birth has lain Immers'd in Night, 'Twere hard to damn him for the want of Sight. Ev'n so, while living in this Mortal State, Our Minds are darkn'd in a Mist of Fate: Thro' a false Medium all we see is shown, And we know nothing as it shou'd be known. Why then shou'd Heav'n so hard a Law display, To dimn our Sight and bid us find the Way? If above Ignorance Man cou'd never rise, 'Tis senseless to Command him to be Wise; And if by Nature he's, to Errors prone, Can a Good God expect him to have none? You'll say perhaps (of all Mistakes the Chief) All this is even'd in a Right Belief; That Sanctuary, where You always run For Refuge when your Arguments are done: Forgetting quite who Nothing does believe, By Consequences, there's Nothing can deceive. The Hell, (so much the fright of Vulgar Elves,) Is made by Coxcombs only for themselves. How can poor Man, that Creature of a Day, Frailty thro'out, and molded from the Clay, In a short Life (how ever vainly spent) Be guilty of Eternal Punishment? Such Notions we shou'd, one and all, distrust, That Stifle Truth, and call a GOD unjust. Hold! hold I cry;—and poize the Balance ev'n, As at the first it seems design'd by Heav'n. Our Knowledge we must Limited confess, And by abusing it we make it less: But shou'd we know as much as Angels do Of Truth, and see by a Cœlestial View; Were ev'ry Mystery naked to us shown, As to the Blest they'll be Hereafter known, What Tryal were there (thus of means bereft To exercise it) for Obedience left? Unless 'twere prov'd that willingly we stood, How cou'd we hope Rewards for being Good? To ev'ry Man of Common Sense 'tis shown, Necessitated Vertue can be none: How can we call him Temperate, Chast and Just, Who does not what he Wou'd but what he Must? The Angels that Elaps'd have made it plain That they, and those whose Purity remain, Like us, a State of some Probation pass'd, E're these were Justify'd, and those were Cast. Without some Care the Wisest cou'd not live To Skill in Arts with Labour we arrive; And shall he save his Soul that will not Strive? Your Notions then we rather shou'd distrust, Perverting Truth, and calling God unjust. In vain (for who can rob the Mind of Light?) You'd throw a Mist of Fate before our Sight; In vain You take, enamour'd of the Kin, To back your Cause, the Ape your Brother in; There's something in us that Assent requires To Heav'nly Things, there fixes and admires, And thither, like a Flame, by Native force aspires: No Bounds it keeps, but, scorning all controul, Asserts a Future State, and half reveals the Soul! To say we Nothing know then, as the first Of all your Arguments, is next the worst: Because, (as 'twere the Porter made to Sin,) 'Tis that which lets all other Vices in: For were that Notion Settl'd once as true, There's Nothing but we Lawfully might do: But of all Errors ever broach'd beside, There is not one so Evidently wide. Who knows not? (tho' with Vices, we confess, Too oft we sink into a Brutal Dress;) But yet who knows not, (tho' he know the least Of all Men,) that he's Nobler than a Beast? His Look, Demeanor, Speech and Form declare That Man was most the Wise Creator's Care. The Brute has Being, and 'twill Perish whole; But 'twas to Man in whom He breath'd a Soul. The Lab'ring Ox, suffic'd with Natures Store, Declines his Abject Head, and seeks no more; Not so contented, Man erects his Eye, And forward shoots at Immortality: 'Tis true, the common Fate he shares, and dies; But has the Brute, like Him a Hope to rise, And, leaving Earth below, with Angels tread the Skies? Who knows not, when he does the Horse survey He's to Command, and 'tother to obey? For Contemplation, Man, and Converse fit, And they their strength to humble to his Wit. Who knows not, that there's Nothing can efface Th'Impressions God does in the Conscience place? There evident they stand, and brightly shine, When daring Men to Impious Paths incline; That by their Pow'rful Calls and constant use, Impenitence may be without Excuse. These Notions then we one and all shou'd Trust Asserting Truth, and proving God is Just. Then (tho' th'Objector does so dimnly see) All Men beside must readily agree Who Nothing does believe can Nothing be. A thousand Things there are (and so design'd) That can be Objects only of the Mind. If on our Beings we reflect with Care, What but a God cou'd make us what we are? Yet since from Demonstration not Receiv'd, It cannot so be known—but must be so Believ'd. We must Believe 'tis an Almighty Hand That does the rowling Spheres, and Starry Host Command; All Times he sees, and does all Places fill, And when his Thunder speaks, the Trembling World is still: The vast Extended Heav'ns his Pow'r declare, And downward look, his Works Assert Him there: Within, we feel Him press us to Repent; And He's in Hell ev'n in his Punishment: Nay if his Word, which You oppose, is true, That Punishment will be Eternal too. For tho' the Criminal but Finite be, He yet offends against Infinity; Who, therefore, weighing Anger by Offence, Proportions Justice to Omnipotence. But since Repentance, as it is our own, Cou'd not Offences Infinite atone, For Ruin'd Man the Son Devotes his Head, Transfer'd the Guilt and suffer'd in our stead! There 'twas that Adam's FALL was Counter-weigh'd, On his own self the Countless Debt he laid; So Infinite by Infinite was Paid. Not that hereby we shou'd presume the least Without our own Endeavours to be Blest: In meer Belief but half of CHRIST we view, Our ev'ry Action there shou'd Centre too: In vain that Faith which does his God-head own, But of his Precepts will not Practise one. Our Notions, thus, are far above distrust, Asserting Truth and proving God is Just. Who is it knows not, that the Scriptures View, The Harmony between the Old and New? So much the Last upon the First depends, So much the Last the Former Recommends, The force of Each without its Voucher ends. Who sees not there a Gracious Saviour stand, Kindly Inviting whom He might Command? Tho' prone to Lapses, there he keeps in view To trim our Lamps, and wasted Grace renew. To the most mean Capacity He's shown, And Ignorance now can be a Plea for None. His Precepts (writ that all may learn) contain Our Duty easy, full, and clear, and plain: His Precepts! all so Pow'rful and Divine, Conviction rises fresh from ev'ry Line! And reading there we must determin'd be, For all's Excess of Love! and Endless Sanctity! Last, as he freely suffer'd for our sakes, So now in Heav'n He Intercession makes For all his Saints, of what Degree so e'er; Who Imitating his Example here, Will Reign with him, at last, in Endless Glory there! Let then the Eternal Word be all our Trust, Asserting Truth, and proving God is Just. Here breaks the Dawn of Everlasting Day! Here Mercy does it self at full display! 'Tis here! and 'tis for ever now to Stay! The Happy News Reveal'd Religion brings Angels Rejoyce at, and all Nature Sings! O Boundless Love! that cou'd from Heav'n descend And God in Man, on Man Redeem'd attend, The Judge became the Saviour and the Friend! What more can Vertue hope or Mercy give Than that the Just Eternally shou'd live?— —But Wretched Man, yet wand'ring from the Right, Will follow Int'rest, Passion, Pride and Spite And cries He's Blind amidst this Blaze of Light. Tho' one wou'd think such Mercies shou'd instill A strength beyond both Appetite and Will: But above all, that it shou'd quite convince The Sceptick, and incline him to a Sense Of the unbounded Care of Providence: But Spurning at Reproof away he hies, And has not yet the Leisure to be Wise: To Things Obscure he will direct his View, O'er which the Hand of Heav'n a Veil has drew; Fond of the False, and Doubtful of the True. His Pleasures call Him, and he must be gone, And new Enjoyments drive the former on, Till in a State of Darkness Life is done. Mean while 'tis plain, whatever Fools distrust, That God is Great, Omniscient, Wise and Just; But vain is Man, and most Perverse his Will, That may be Good, and chuses to be Ill. The Third Part. Thus have we prov'd the Sceptick worse than mad; And yet to what is said we'll further add, The Men in Place and Power are quite as bad: Nay cou'd we paint 'em justly, we shou'd see That Greatest Names have most of Infamy. The Politician first does cross our Eyes, That first of Fools of all that think they're Wise Sometimes he with a Youthful Face is seen, At once his Age and Intellectuals Green, His Notion Moody and uncouth his Mien; Proud of his Parts he looks to be Rever'd, As if we never yet in Senate heard Of Legislative Fops without a Beard. If twice or thrice he passes in Debate, He thinks on Nothing but to Steer the State; Forgetting quite no Fame arises thence Where Arrogance supplies the Place of Sense; Or when a Lawless Sp?r over rules, To be his Substitute in Gulling Fools. Sometimes he like a rough Divine is dress'd, More Foolish in that Shape than all the rest: A State above can little be his Care Who Studies nothing but his Rising here: Vain the Endeavour and his Notions wild, That wou'd have GOD and Mammon reconcil'd. Sometimes he like a finish'd Beau appears, Prink'd up in Contradiction to his Years; Sometimes he wears a heavy Gown of State, With feeble Hams that scarce Support the Weight; Creeping he Walks, as Tony whilom did, And in his Breast as deep a Rancour's hid. But tho' on high the Mace before we find, And a long Train besmear'd with Gold behind, Looking, while the Litigious Tribe attends, Like Lucifer surrounded by his Fiends, 'Tis all but Pageantry; and shewn abroad To make the Ass Obsequious to his Load. But these are but a Poor and Mungrel sort Of Politicians, rais'd or sunk in sport By those more true ones that Preside at Court Who make all other Reading Mortal Sin But Richlieu, Machiavel, and Mazarine, Or Hobs, their Favorite from another Bent, Who teaches—after Death no Punishment. But how can we that Wretch a Patriot name Whose Guilt is the Foundation of his Fame? What e'er he may in Cabinet debate, His Whores have more his Service than the State. View but at home his Follies and his Crimes, You'd Swear a Fiend might sooner mend the Times, Want, Rapine, Dunning and Domestick strife Imbitter all his Hours, and make a Hell of Life. What care can of his Countries Good be shown So Mindless, or so Reckless of his own? His Patrimony he does thus Divide; One part in Three is Squander'd by his Bride At Ombre,—and a certain Game beside; The other Two his Punks and Flatt'rers get; So all he Eats and Drinks and Wears—is Debt. At last, (his Children's Marriage grown his Care,) Resolv'd his Broken Fortunes to repair, He puts his Prince on Arbitrary Rule, And turns a Rogue for having plaid the Fool. His Counsels if but likely to succeed He cares not who is Ruin'd, who does Bleed. Whole Subsidies does thro' his Fingers go; And as a famous Lord was said to do, The Mighty Mass, regardless of the Laws, He cross a large Grid-inon slowly draws; What he brings over, happens to the Crown; And all that falls between he Pockets for his own. Mean while, by Wealth Indempnify'd from fear, The British Glory's not at all his Care; Nor does he mind our Balance, fam'd so far, Of weighing out to Europe Peace, or War; But Bribing high each Legislative Brother He sinks one half, and stops their Mouths with 'tother. How can the Senator, tho' wond'rous wise, See with a Golden Mist before his Eyes? Secure, it all Assemblies Over-Rules, But most, 'tis seen in those where Most are Knaves and Fools. Such Representatives too sadly prove They Bribe below but to be Brib'd above. Hence are our present Scene of Ills deriv'd, And by the accursed Pattern more contriv'd: Hence lie our Armies and our Fleets unpaid; Hence Spring the Publick Debts, and bane of Publick Trade. For how can such a Wretch; tho' he may sit At Helm advanc'd for his pernicious Wit, Believe a Nation Prosp'rous can be From Counsels laid, and hatch'd in Villany? Raising Estates by such Flagitious Ways As shames the Rapine of all former Days? Pension'd from Foreign Courts, and taking Pay Our Country, King, and Councils to betray? How dare he talk of Conq'ring France, or Rome That brings us to the last Distress at home? If 'twere his dearest Brother held the Glass He cou'd not less than for a Villain pass; And much a Villain must be more an Ass. Thus by the Politician we may see That Greatest Names are first in Infamy. Th'Ambitious Man do's next ascend the Stage; The high rais'd Beacons of a Sanguin Age. Whether by Heav'n they are directly sent To be a Sinful People's Punishment; Or whether what the Prince of Hell intends, To prove some Men more Impious than his Fiends; Or whether 'tis deriv'd from Noble Blood, Which least of all Delights in doing Good; Be it what ever way y'are pleas'd to guess, 'Tis all Transcendency of Wickedness! Rape, Plunder, Devastation, Fire and Dread Attend their horrid Steps where e'er they tread; And like the Sea usurping on the Shore, They make the affrighted Country fly before. In vain You urge that there was never known An Age so Wise and Polish'd as our own, When the most Learn'd and the Politest Times Produce the Deepest Plots, and Bloodiest Crimes. From the first William to Eliza read Our Annals o'er; count ev'ry Wicked Deed Thro' all those Reigns, of Statesmen, Priest and Prince, They're nothing to the Tale committed since. What was it that in James his time cou'd Frame The Powder Plot? a Crime beyond a Name! What but Ambition? true, we must confess To hide the Fraud it took a Priestly Dress; But underneath the Gown the Ponyard lay, To make three Glorious Realms at once the Papal Pray. Had but the Train have taken, where had been The once so Impious Name of Catiline? Had He the Empire of the World o'erthrown, He had long been doing what a Moment here had done: King, Lords and Commons, high as well as low, Had all at once been murder'd at a Blow: But Powder was to Him unknown; the Earth Had then not teem'd with that Prodigious Birth! What made the Leaders in this Prince's Reign Sow Feuds and Sect'aries thro' the British Plain, But, when the Season serv'd, to reap the Gain? For Hero's not for Fame alone devour, As know'ng Profit must be link'd to Pow'r, If Crowds believe they Act in their Defence, Weak are the Laws, Precarious is the Prince. Such were the Times when Charles the Scepter sway'd; That best of Princes, and the worst Obey'd, What was it but some few Ambitious Men, Where yet the Leaders are but Eight or Ten, That caus'd the War? by which, on either side, A Hundred Thousand Native Britons dy'd? Who had their Valour been Employ'd abroad, France had been humbl'd, and its Tyrant aw'd; While by a bless'd Prevention, we had sav'd The Blood that since w'ave lost, and Kingdoms since Enslav'd. What but Ambition, at this Martyr's Fall, Made an Audacious Senate grasp at all? And what but That inclin'd their Bloody Chief To make 'em Fools, tho' rais'd for their Relief? What but th'Ambition of the Fiends of Rome, (And Legislative Sots in feuds at home,) Seal'd, sign'd, and carry'd on the Irish Doom? A scene of Cruelty exceeding far All that was ever done by Famine, Plague and War. And what but that, or yet a worse Pretence, Has made 'em seek our Ruin ever since? In secret Murders first they flesh'd their Cause, In Armies next, and Violated Laws: With Plots on Plots our Peace they undermin'd, Which as detected still they more design'd And tho' so bad, yet worse Remain'd behind: Till Glorious William did at last appear, And Leaving Law to lay their Practice bare, Ended at once their Treach'ry and our Fear. Nor only them; but, with pernicious Rage, This Vice does Influence Sex, Degree, and Age. What have not Wives, what have not Virgins done To rise, and be the Strumpets of a Throne? The Country Bumkin, bred with Labour hard, Thinks all Ambition is to mount the Guard: But in a little Time he fain wou'd be An Officer of some advanc'd Degree; That Officer a General wou'd commence. And Cromwell like, possess'd of Pow'r wou'd next depose his Prince. The Nobler born uneasy with delay, Pursue Advancement by a readier way: If the old Prince their Proud Demands deny, (as most of Pride has least of Loyalty) Without Remorse his Ruin they pursue, To purchase S?rs and Titles of the new. Cou'd it be known what Villanies are done To wear a G?rge, and Tye a Gr?ter on, Our English Annals might of Horrors tell At once outvying Sodom, Rome and Hell; No Tye, however Sacred, stops their Course, But on they furious drive, from bad to worse: Nor can you Mention any Glorious Ill, Be it to Ravish, Bugger, Burn or Kill, But if they have the Means, the'll find the Will. And thus, by the Ambitious Man, we see That Greatest Names are first in Infamy. With these we may the tow'ring Minion place, Rais'd to a Fa'vorite from a Linage base; Whether for Merit we'll not here dispute, Or to Indulge a Vice that ne'er produces Fruit: But once aloft, the utmost Scorn he flings On those below, talks proud and mighty things, And, Elbowing all the Peers, will only Herd with Kings. The Skies he thinks are by his Footsteps trod; His Prayers, Extortion, and the Prince, his God. Some Thousands, hence, we Yearly see undone, To raise a vast Possession but for one. No Course he for his Master thinks unjust That may advance his Inte'rest, Pow'r or Lust. Conscience and Law he deems as empty things; And Compacts, Ties beneath the care of Kings. The Courtier when he frowns their Ruin doubt; Just as He's pleas'd in Office, or without. The Nobles of an Ancient Line he hates; First, aming at their Heads; and next, at their Estates: Tho' yet perhaps our Annals may allow That they were rais'd by what he rises now. Thus does the wretch audaciously drive on, Careless of Right, and cover'd by a Throne, Nor dreams amid'st his Glories of a Turn; As now our Wonder, to be then our Scorn. Unhappy He! and crazy in his Sense, That rashly strives, in Seasons of Offence, T'Enslave the People, or mislead the Prince: They once will meet (as where the Grain has been) And grind to Dust the Seeds of Strife between: And just the Fate; that wou'd whole Nations Fool With Squander'd Taxes, and Despotick Rule. But tho' this haughty Minion stand so high, No basest Office must he e'er deny, But e'en be damn'd without enquiring, why? The Pleasure of his Prince he must advance With Strumpets here, or Politicks from France; As Wolsey did the hard-Mouth'd Henry wait, His Ev'ning Pimp, and Morning Slave of State. The way at Court to Grandeur must be sure When Crimes like these are made the Rise to Pow'r. Ah Wrethed Man! who, his Paternal Seat Disdaining, will be Wicked to be Great! That thinks not, rais'd by Ruin Blood and Strife, On his late Father's Peaceful Country Life: Who free from Guilt, and so, of course, from Fear, Liv'd nobly on Two Hundred Pounds a Year. And wisely managing that happy Store, Kept out of Debt, and fed the Neigh'bring Poor, Without one thought of ever seeking more: Till reaching at the last an Honour'd Age, With Universal Praise he left the Stage; But with this Lesson to his Son behind.— I leave as I was left; nor more desire to find, Pervert not the last dying Wills of Men, Nor hold at Court a Secretaries Pen With Thousand Mischiefs, You'll be then beset, Which in this Guiltless Shade I never met. Then You must Bribe a Senator to be, And Villains of the blackest Infamy, And yet the Guiltier grow as higher in Degree. Then Innocence You'll use with utmost Spite, And with Successful Wrong extinguish feeble Right. Then to your Side corrupted Votes you'll draw; False shall usurp on True, and Pow'r shall be the Law. The Guiltless BARD shall be in Durance thrown, The Scandal his, and yet the Crime your own. In short, You then must be Sir S?rs Tool, Alternate, now a Knave and now a Fool. In vain, alas! this Good Advice is given; Father and Son but seldom go to Heav'n. Quite thwarting of a Dying Parents Will, And higher rising more confirm'd in Ill, He shoves along; and Nest'ling near a Crown, Thinks all the British Dignities his own; The Bad advances, does the Good depress, And, like a Devil, proud of the Success: Thoughtless, amidst his Glories of a Turn, As now our Wonder to be then our Scorn; Or that a Future Doom will once Impeach The Crimes that stand too high for Human Law to reach. But chiefly for this Pride of Mind he's known Of carrying thro' all future Ages down His Riches, Issue, Titles and Renown: So blest a Fate! that, wou'd he but reflect, On former Times 'twere Madness to expect. For where is Gaveston's and Spencer's Name? Where's Empson, Dudley, N. and Buckingham? If for those Founders in their several Lines We deign to look, there's Nothing Dimlier shines; Vapours, that long ago exhal'd, are gone, And while they Influenc'd Boding to the Throne. So that, as Heretofore, we yet may see The Greatest Names are first in Infamy. You'll say (perhaps) I undistinguish'd strike, And use the Vile and Worthy both a like; That many of the Great are truely Just; And as these dye, by consequence there must Be others rais'd to Honour, Pow'r and Trust. Nay, You may further add, we now may view A set of Men no Nation else can shew, The least of whom cou'd bear an Empires Weight And steer the Helm in worst Extremes of Fate; Men to whose Reach our Foes designs are known, Yet think so deep no Sight can pierce their own, Till to the Birth, and level'd Right they come This Nation to Protect, or That to Doom. And then as such so well can Counsel, so There is a Class that can as Nobly do, Conquer at Land, and Triumph on the Seas.— And who Detracts from Men so brave as These? Forbid it Heav'n we shou'd revile the Name Of Dev?shr, of L?ds and Not?hm, Of Shr?s?ry, Mar?b?row and Fames early Son Great Or?nd, and the Prudent Ad?don, With Roch?ter, the Guardian of the Throne. Nor must we Thee, O Nor?m?by! omit, If we'd be just to Worth, or true to Wit: Tho' high you sit in the Judicial Chair, You are no less a Legislator here. With the same Wonder Rome did Horace view The British Isle shall ever mention YOU! Scarce cou'd Appollo nobler Laws ordain, Or write 'em in a more Harmonious Strain: In all You Teach so Useful Just, and Great, That 'tis, methinks, Descending to Intend the State. To Men like these, so faithful in the Cause Of Royalty, Religion, and the Laws, We shou'd Address as if above Applause: And well they may the Muses aid disclaim, That from themselves derive Immortal Fame; And to be truely Patriots understood, Nor Value Praise or Blame, or Wealth or Blood, In Competition with their Countries Good. But then, on 'tother side, there are a Set Of Courtiers, only just like Tumors Great; Bloated with Pride they Lord it o'er their Kind, And never Just but when 'tis undesign'd. No real Worth they bear from Top to Toe, But all's Appearance, Lacquer, Wash, and Show: Prudence is quite Exploded, Truth defy'd, And Interest made their Universal Guide: Stiff in Deportment, Treach'rous in Address, Crushing the Brave, and barring all Access: Justling for Place, and eager of a Name, They drive at all, and shove along to Fame. Ne'er but in Brib'ry parting with their Store, Or Feeing Lawyers to defraud the Poor;— In short, just the Reverse of those we nam'd before But certainly, to oppress their Fellow-Creature As he like them, was not of Human Nature; By Fraud and Rapine vast Estates to get, Yet never lend nor ever pay a Debt; On Things Divine opprobrious Terms to fix, And place all Merit in a Coach and Six; To ruin Tenants, Witnesses Subborn, Make Villainy their Care, and Worth their Scorn; To blast the Vertue which they can't debauch, In Lux'ry plung'd, and laughing ut Reproach: Both Friends and Foes relentless to devour. That stand between 'em and their Rise to Pow'r: To Sell to France the Fruits of all our Care, And make a Peace of worse Effects than War. To think no Glory is on Earth so Great As that of being nam'd in the Gazette; Where among Spaniels lost their Acts are shown Equal in Worth, and Rivals in Renown: To think it Honour only to have Riches, And Sense to make in S? Factious Speeches; Where one bad Man is capable to do More Mischief, and shall have more Followers, too, In Faction, Innovation, Strife and Blood, Than Fifty that design their Countries Good: So that, perhaps, of late we Judge too wide To think the most to be the better Side; True Musick don't consist in Tale of Notes, Nor Justice in Majority of Votes. If Office can (I say) such Crimes create, The basest Life is thus becomming Great: Mean while we by such Legislators see That Greatest Names are first in Infamie. But these are Subjects:—let us next Survey The Few that have the height of Human Sway: And first the Gallick Monarch shall appear, Nor need we mention more; for all we hear Or read of Tyrant is included there: A Spacious Kingdom by Descent his Own, Where he might Reign with Glory and Renown, May justly be conceiv'd enough for One. With Peace, with Plenty, Piety and Trade, How happy might that Ancient Realm be made! Nor better can a Prince himself secure Than by his Subjects Love, the surest Base of Pow'r. Quite Contrary, on Strife he builds his Throne, Faithless to other States, but Fatal to his own; Nor any Good has all his Life design'd But Blood, and the Enslaving Humankind: In the Black Roll of Tyrants justly first, As well of Princes, as of Christians worst; And here shall stand Eternally accurst. What Neigh'bring Nations has he over-run! What Devastations caus'd! what Mischiefs done! And for no End but barely to Devour, And by his Cruelty assert his Pow'r. Proud as the Angel that from Heav'n was flung. And threat'ns with the same Audacious Tongue: But never cou'd his Pride his mind inflame To Martial Deeds; he shun'd the dangerous Game, Nor e'er in Fighting Field wou'd dare to purchase Fame To Cæsar's Glory vainly he aspires, Who when the Din of War begins, retires: What Thoughts he has of GOD he does proclaim In mock Te Deums sung at Notre-Dame; Where Publickly he does his Thanks address, When any Treach'rous Action meets Success; That the Gull'd Subject may from thence be brought To think he Conquer'd what he basely bought. What Countless Treasure has he rais'd by Force? Levy'd by Plunder, yet dispos'd of worse. In Poys'ning only Millions he employs, And smiles when he can Kill without a Noise. Thus Feuds and Murders he thro' Europe sends, And chiefly Prospers by dividing Friends. To such a Num'rous Tale his Crimes abound, That Mercy Shrinks, and Sickens at the Sound! Who after this, to his Eternal Shame, Wou'd e'er assume the Peaceful Christian Name? Most Christian, too!—as if he understood Our SAVIOUR's Laws were all, like Draco's, writ in Blood. O Parricide! O eldest born of Hell! O Arrogance that knows no Parallel! Remit, O Gracious Heav'n! thy Raging Ire, And let the Monster now, at last, expire: Enough, enough of Christian Blood is shed, Nor can the Grave contain the Crowded Dead. Let Europe her Dejected Visage raise, Wash of her Gore, and see some Halcyon Days, And next employ 'em all in thy Eternal Praise. We own our Sins, the sad Effects we rue; But take away this Plague and grant a New: Beneath thy Hand we shall some Favours find, But nothing from this Scourge of Human kind: Below some burning Mountain let him Howl, Eternally convinc'd he has a Soul. Or, if it better please Thee, let him here Have first a Tast of what he Merits there: Tho' now he thinks He's Seated in the Skies, Precipitate Him down, no more to Rise; Let Him in vain for past Successes call; 'Twill be a very Hell to see his Fall: Let him at last perceive, in very Deed, That rank Ambition is a Poys'nous Weed, Not of Celestial but Infernal Seed; And that like Oaks, the more its height ascends, The more the Root shoots downward to the Fiends. 'Twere loss of Time for further Proof to see; For here's an Instance in the last Degree, That Greatest Names are first in Infamy. The Fourth Part. In Spite of all the Villains last decry'd, There yet are others that have err'd as wide From Sanctity misled, and misapply'd: The Unity tho' ev'ry Sect'rist rends, Each on his Faith, as Orthodox, depends; And give 'em but their way, our whole Religion ends. Th'Objection here may be—that such as these Who, just like Madmen, know not their Disease, But have their Failings rooted at the Brain, We Lash or Laugh at equally in vain. I answer, were we sure the Sick wou'd die Unless we did one Med'cine more apply, The Indiscretion were not much to try. The last Extreme has often Wonders wrought, And made a Cure beyond the Leeches thought: Who then can tell, when Rage with Truth combines, Th'Effect of daring, but Instructive Lines? The World is Madness to the last Decree, And ev'ry one (but for himself) can see That all besides are touch'd with Lunacy. To those in Bedlam some Respect we bear, There 'tis indeed Humanity to spare; Especially the Few whose Maladies From Chance, or Natural Causes did arise. Besides, the Rest are by a Fate severe Paying at full for that which brought 'em there; Love, Jealousy, Ambition, Lust and Pride, Revenge and Lucre;—or what else beside: These I shall wave, (as odious to appear To Human View,) and only mention here The Folly, Frenzy, Vanity and Sin Of some without that ought to be within. Suppose a Heathen on our Sabbath Day Shou'd all our different Swarms of Sects survey Flock to their Meetings, or behold 'em come Hungry with tedious stay and driving home; The Antinomians and Fanaticks there, The Quaker, Baptist, and Socinian here; With fifty other sorts too long to name, Thoughtless of Truth, and Christians to their shame; What cou'd he say? but with an Angry tone Cry out—O Jove! is yet the Use not done, Of Man's believing in more Gods than one! Or shou'd he hear 'em, with what Virulence They wrest the Scriptures from their Genuine Sense; How bitterly th'Establish'd Faith they ply With Spite, Aspersion and Indignity, Only because it can't in Fact agree With Nonsense, Guile and Contrariety; And, ceasing to be led by Scripture Rules, Become no Church to pleasure Knaves and Fools. Shou'd he observe how some Perswasions place Their Purity in Whining and Grimace, And all Good Manners in a Sullen Face; Forgetting quite there can no Error be In undesigning Looks, and Cheerful Modesty: Truth and Good Humour cannot be disjoyn'd, And Vertue must be one with Peace of Mind: To make Religious and Morose agree, Has this with that no least Consistency? Or shou'd we others shew him, all within (They say) Perfection, and exempt from Sin; Wrought up to such a Frame of Truth and Love As can't attain more Purity above; That thence Inspir'd they nothing say, or do, But what like God is Just, and more than Scripture true: Yet all the while such Boobies, Sots and Elves, Their very Brutes are wiser than themselves: A Race that Knave and Fool at once commence; Careless of Church and State, of Priest and Prince, Nor to be reconcil'd to Manners, Truth, and Sense: Churning their Jaws, when e'er they teach the Rout Their Light within turns all to Foam without: Bigotted to that Impudent Degree, That keeping on their Caps, and Thou and Thee, They think the utmost Marks of Sanctitie: So but their Hats refuse the Civil ply, And the Cravat's so short as just to Tye, Their Consciences are still, and hear no Call Mean while Extortion, Slander, Pride and Gall, Are things they never boggle at at all In short, were Heav'n by Rancour to be won, Their Business wou'd Effectively be done, And all be happy, ev'ry Mother's Son. But since that Glorious State w'are not to gain By Dullness, Spite, and Freakishness of Brain; Since Peace to slight, and Falshood to affect, Can never be the Marks of the Elect; Such wilfull Men, in spite of all their Din, Wou'd seem to any that had Bedlam seen More Craz'd without than all their Friends within. But further, were our Ancient next to see A Set of Teachers all Hypocrisie, And yet their Flocks the more exactly fit; A sort of Hearers always mainly smit With much Inveteracy, and little Wit. Shou'd he observe (suppose it to him known) What small Regard is to our Rubrick shown, And what a Stress is laid on Rambles of their own; Forgetting He that will in Publick Pray Without one previous Thought of what to say, Must be a Sot not worth our while to hear; And if he thinks before, 'tis not Extempore Pray'r. Cou'd but the Truth be known, 'twou'd soon be found The Men that so in Fluency abound, Or rather, that wou'd be so Gifted thought, Have, at the Bottom, all their Cant by Roat; And that it does as easily arise As Rufull Emphasis, and Goggling Eyes; To which of late they such Regard have shown As Heav'n were gain'd by Aspect, and by Tone. But granting what they Use Extempore Pray'r It yet must be a Form to those that hear, Because confin'd they to the Words must be, The very same as to our Rubrick, We: So that, in short, from Forms away they run, And follow but a Form when all is done; Only they take the Worse, and better shun. We all at once Respond, and know to what; While they Implicitly, and fond of that, Return Amen to vain, and oft to Impious Chat. Alike Perversly, Cassock, Scarf and Gown, With them are Rags of Rome and Babylon. But pray where is the Diffe'rence to be found Between two Garbs, if both must touch the Ground? Why shou'd the Dress we nam'd be counted wrong, When their own Teachers have their Cloaks as long? Thus a Peculiar wear with Us they slight, Yet a Peculiar wear with them is Right. But White, that Dangerous Colour, gives Offence, Tho' meant but to Resemble Innocence, That Peace and Truth in Worship may be joyn'd And Decency with Purity of Mind. The Man 'tis told us, after God's own Heart In Robes of Linen Sung and Prais'd his Part; And so the Levites (whence our Usage springs) When e'er they Taught, or Handl'd Holy Things: Beside we in th'Apocalypse may read Who lov'd the Lamb, and for the Lamb did bleed, In Heav'n it self that spotless Colour wear; And why then shou'd it be forbid us here When thither we, like them, wou'd rise by Praise and Pray'r? Or lastly, shou'd he see another sort Of Christians that make all the rest their sport; But with this Difference be it understood, 'Tis not with Fau'ts and Follies, but with Blood: Witness their Halters, their Dragoons, and Fire, By which so many Blameless Souls expire, Only because they will not quit their Sense, And let Impossibilities convince. Fansie our Heathen had at Bedlam been After his Sight of this so Rufull Scene, He'd swear these Lunaticks without were worse than those within. But Dress, Grimace, and Nonsense may be bore, There's something yet more dangerous at the Core: Tho' Harmless in it self to have no Sense, It may be Fatal in it's Consequence: For Proof, to Gape and Bawl, and Cry and Whine, (As Teaching were to them like Storms to Swine) Is sport at which ev'n Truth it self may smile, All Fright their Aspect, and all Cant their stile; So mean, perverse, incongruous, dull and flat, Their Gossips mend it in their Maudlin Chat! But then, while this mistaken Worship's shown Their other secret Ends are driving on; Designs which from our Fathers Times we rue, And notwithstanding all the Love we shew; When e'er they can, they'll certainly renew. For, first, our Discipline they all condemn, And think Salvation only meant for them. Each wou'd Establish what their selves profess, And still the more their Zeal, their Love is less; Till they at last to such a Pitch arrive, Whose Creed is not as theirs, is thought too vile to live. From this bad Mind, took from the Papal Sway, The Murdering for God's service came in Play, That Monst'rous Race! and steep'd to that degree In Blood, as shames all former Cruelty; Who hating, like Caligula, to do A Puny Ill, to take a Head or so, Are still for Chopping off a Kingdom at a Blow. But why must Murder take Saint Peter's Station? And Guilt and Rage set up for Reformation? Some Penal Sums the Civil Power may Rate Those Factious Men that wou'd disturb the State, And, in a Church and Nation govern'd well, Teach Fools to Cant, and Rascals to Rebell; But what least Shadow of a Reason's giv'n By Men or Angels, that the Will of Heav'n Is, These to Those the Doom of Death shou'd give, For not believing what they can't believe? If Damnable it is conceiv'd to hold Some Errors new, or others that are old, 'Tis yet more Damnable by vast Degrees, On People of a different Faith to Seize, And, Mercyless, cut off by Pow'r and Passion, Ev'n when we think their State is Reprobation: Our Hate we thus to other Worlds pursue, Exerting, so, the utmost we can do, To kill at once both Soul and Body too; When in a little time, perhaps, they might Have seen their Errors, and Embrac'd the Right; Or rather did before to that belong, For Persecution's always in the Wrong. Copy'd from hence, the Baptist, had his Swill In German Towns to Ravage, Burn and Kill; As if their Sacrament they understood Not dipt in Water, but Immers'd in Blood. The Independent and Fanatick here. Have open'd a like Sluce of Plague and War; Murders that yet wou'd make the hardest Melt, Cou'd it be told as truely as 'twas felt. Thus while they Govern'd with Successful Might, The Sequestrations were their Chief Delight; That was Religion, and their Pow'r was Right. Who that had liv'd in such a Barbar'ous Age, When all was slaughter, Plunder, Fire and Rage? Or who that now Surveys a sort of Men, (From Lob down to the Passive Sons of P?n,) All eager to revive those Times again? But must, with Horror in his Face, confess This Greater Bedlam wilder than the less! Then for their Disputants, and Terms they use, Some to Pervert, and others to Abuse, What do they but make Truth the vastly more abstruse? A hardn'd Race! who rather than unsay One Error, will make Thousands go astray, And hurry blindly on to Sin and Doubt, Only because they wou'd be thought without. But God, we plainly may in Scripture see, Did not intend to poze Mortality; What Paul does of Himself and Cephas say Shews CHRIST design'd not each a several Way. In short the Path to our Salvation's this, So easie, 'tis not Possible to miss, Wou'd we the Truth unprejudic'd pursue, Nor leave the Ancient Rules for Notions vain and new. These Things (said the Evangelist Saint John) Are Written, and these Miracles are shown To fix you in this Faith, and this alone; That JESUS (He who left the blest Abode, To dye for Man) was CHRIST, the Son of GOD; And that believing so (that thence he came A Sacrifice for Sin, and free from Blame,) You may have Life Eternal thro' his Name. This is our Faith; and what w'are next to do Is but to follow one Command, or two; Be (first) Your Love to each as Mine has been to You: Performing this, the next You cannot shun, To do to others as You wou'd have done To You and Yours,—and endless Life's your own! In other Words as follows;—wou'd You be From Present Fear, and Future Danger free? Wou'd You in both Worlds have Your Soul's Delight? Keep Innocent and do the Thing that's Right, And, whether such a Life run slow, or fast, 'Twill meet with Joy, and endless Peace at last. Here lies the Christian Faith, and Practice all, Summ'd up effectively, tho' Summ'd in small: My Soul for Yours, but so Believe, and Do, 'Twill give You Peace below, and Peace Eternal too. What a strange Race are then these heedless Men That think Religion's Parrying with the Pen! As if with us 'twere only Feuds and Jarrs As with the French, Dragoons and Massacres. In short, by Steering toward such various Shelves, We darken, puzzle, and Confound our selves: Right Reason, which shou'd at the Helm preside, In all the Purity of Scripture try'd They will not own, or suffer for a Guide: Mean while a Thousand different Ways they split, And Guile and Nonsense take for Grace and Wit. Those follow Prejudice and Interest there; These Bigottry, and scorn of Publick Pray'r; Pride in the Front, and Malice in the Reer. Others are led by Fury, Foam and Spite. And a Left-handed Zeal believe the Right. In the mean time, with Sorrow 'tis confess'd, The true Belief's not seen in the Contest, So many false Ones Arguing which is best. Ah wou'd they better Live, and Scribble less, How soon our Sectaries such a Change wou'd bless! For Printed Disputations have, we find, Yet more than all distracted Humankind: In Barns their Hearers doze out half their Strains, But in these Tracts th'Untemper'd Filth remains. Impossible we shou'd expose to View All the Contended Points they dash and brew, It only shall Suffice to name a Few. But such, at least, as shall Abhorrence win From Madmen, and ev'n make their College grin, To see our Fools without outdo their Freaks within. What Faith have some to Image Worship paid; As if the Scene in Ephesus were laid And making Shrines for Jesus were a Trade; Kneeling to Stocks and Stones, when nothing more The Sacred Writ does threathen and abhor. The Adoration to the Virgin giv'n But ranks her with Astarte, Queen of Heav'n: Grant her a Saint, as we must all confess, The making her a Goddess makes her less. Then to the Martyrs to address by Pray'r Was never heard for full five Hundred Year, Till in the Papal Church they broach'd it there. Nor yet of their Petitions, for the Dead Can there be any thing Material said; For granting 'twere not meerly done for Gain, Tis but at best, Ridiculous and Vain: But for their Praying to 'em, it must be Nor more, nor less than flat Idolatry. In such a Scheme of Worship to proceed Looks as we did no Mediator need; For if the Saints can do, why did our Saviour Bleed? How have their Works of Supererogation Been Trumpeted by Blookheads thro' the Nation! Strange they shou'd better be than Heav'n desires, When the least Duty all our strength requires, And Scripture does so much on this Enlarge, 'Tis Man's the Debt, and Christ that does discharge: His Wisdom only 'twas that found the Way, And 'twas his Goodness only that cou'd Pay. Be Human Life as holy as it will, At best 'tis but Unprofitable still. How can our most Subline Endeavours rise To equal Infinitely Good, and Wise! Less wou'd not do, cou'd Man for Sin atone, And fly to Heav'n on Pinions of his own. O Truth Revers'd! for all the while 'tis thus, We reach not that, but that descends to us! But tho' such Faults no Reason can excuse; 'Tis Nothing to the Wonder that ensues; For, Transubstantiated by a Pray'r The Priest asserts, tho' Bread does but appear, The Whole, Entire, Essential Saviour's there; That Individual Flesh and Blood he wore When on th'Accursed Cross our Sins he bore: So that at once, his Double Pow'r to shew, He makes his God and Consecrates him too: A Tenet worse than Egypt's wild Opinion When they Ador'd, among the rest, an Onion; But never to the Pope's Presumption grew; They Eat but wou'd not own they made it to: The Canibals were sure a Race but odd, But what are these that can devour their God! Then for Infallibility, the Fruit It bears is Endless Volumes of Dispute; An Errour that does Thousands else comprise, To that they are Resolv'd, from that they rise; So wild a Monster! Discord's all her Food, Devouring much of Ink, but more of Blood. The Vatican it self contains, if one, Ten Thousand Authors on that Point alone; Which were a Man by Scripture Rules to try And their Deposing Doctrine by the By; From whence to the King Killing Mufty's giv'n At once the Crowns of Earth, and Keys of Heav'n; Dropping to whom he Pleases Kingdoms here, And to his Perjur'd Sons Salvation there. Were but, I say, some Good Impartial Man Such black Assuming seriously to Scan, He'd soon the proud Infatuation find To be all Tumour, and Reverse of Mind, And Rome's Spiritual Bedlam, manag'd thus, Much Wilder than the Secular with us. What strange Confusions, next, have taken place From the Perverse Expositors of Grace! What Tomes have been produc'd by Reprobation, Free-will, Election and Predestination! And this so Positive, as if they'd heard The plain, Eternal Will of God declar'd, Before the Earth was form'd or Sun appear'd. What bolder Crime can be by Man presum'd Than pointing who are sav'd, and who are doom'd? Nearly to these are these Disputes ally'd Of being Sanctify'd, and Justify'd; So wrested from the Genuine Sense they bear, 'Tis just a Maze by what Preposte'rous Care It's render'd dark, what Scripture makes so clear. What Bawling has the Private Spirit made By Fumes and Guesses to the Brain convey'd, And calling in of Nonsense to her Aid? Unerring Conduct she believes her Due; In Rome 'tis false, but in herself 'tis true; So Rails against it, and Asserts it too. Some upon Tracts of Inspiration fall, As if they'd been in the Third Heav'n with Paul, When all they Teach is Rancour, Spite and Gall. Others Election to that height profess, That, Good or Ill, they're sure of Happiness; Nay, tho' they dy'd both in their Sin and Shame, Without ev'n hearing a Saviour's Name, They yet assert their Bliss wou'd be the same. Some lose themselves in a like dangerous Mist, That Justice, and that Mercy can't consist, And Schemes wou'd lay by finite Human Sense, For an Exacter Sway by Providence. Some to their Pray'rs so scurvily will fall, In Streets and Markets they presume a Call; And some more Wild, are for no Pray'rs at all. Mean while their Leaders Snarl, and Grin, and Jar, And press with Reams of Pamphlets to the War. Added to these, what Volumes may we see Where Paul and James but seem to disagree? While Faith and Works by different Lights are shown, Confounding two that must be always one; For He that has not both, had e'en as Good have none. From these Divisions, hateful to the Sight, (And many we have nam'd and more we might) Revenge, Contention, and Dislike arise, Boil in our Blood, and Lighten from our Eyes Driving along, till they Obliterate quite The very Notions both of Wrong and Right. The Scripture that we quote we turn to Gall; On Heav'n we look, but thence for Fire we call, And Heat, and Pride, and Frenzy govern all: So that but go to Bedlam, You wou'd Swear Much less of Blood and Ruin wou'd appear, Of Rage, of Virulence, of Hate and Sin, If those were out, and all our Sectaries in; From whom cou'd we, but so, the Future Ages free, How wou'd they bless the Care we took of Lunacy! Unhappy Church of England!—but the best That ever yet the Christian Name Profess'd: From Earliest Times she does her Worship draw, Her Linage just as Ancient as her Law. By Test of Scripture all her Doctrine's try'd, And only follows as th'Apostles Guide; So that She can't be Judg'd of modern date, Unless Saint Paul and Peter were of late. Fathers She quotes, and on their Sense relies For the first Five and purest Centuries; Councils She owns for Publick Service meant, Not such as the last Monster was of Trent. The Mitre too She wears, the Crosier holds, But uses all her Power in saving Souls. So far her Mind from Persecution's found, She trembles at an Inquisitions sound, And wonders Meekness shou'd so much Decrease To raise Confusion from the Sourse of Peace. Not that she wants a Power Judicial, when Her Constitution's Min'd by Treach'rous Men; But then, ev'n that Judicial Pow'r is Judg'd Best in the Civil Administration lodg'd; Because (Intent on Things of Greater weight,) The Church shou'd still be guarded by the State: From hence her Tests and Penal Laws arose, Not that her Will's to threaten, or Impose, But to be screen'd from her Inveterate Foes; Fixt in which Circle, She, in that Redoubt, Can ward against the Schismaticks without; But if beyond the Ring they dare descend, They clip her Right;—and Right she may defend: For Passive tho' she be (as knowing well Her Duty is to suffer, not Rebell) Yet when Commands by Lawless Pow'r are laid, That wou'd break God's Commands to have Obey'd, She first Refuses, as her Scripture Right; And Urg'd beyond, Opposes Might to Might: Not that this Needful Doctrine current runs, Or has been sided with by all her Sons: By that indeed her Laicks stand or fall, But she, what e'er th'Extremes, is yet for suffering all: Her Seculars, when Boundless Pow'r appears, Oppose against it, Buckler, Sword, and Spears; But all her own Defence is Fasting, Pray'rs and Tears. What e'er Scurrility her Foes invent, This is her Use in turns of Government: And tho' so oft they've strove to pull her Down, They find her yet Inseparate to the Crown. Then for her Rites, and Moderate Discipline, Religion never drew a Nobler Scene: So Cautious Wrong with Rigour to pursue, She never suffers, but she Pardons too. From needless Ceremonies wholly free, For those she has are kept for Decencie; So both the dangerous Rocks does wisely shun, Of Using Many, and of having None. But for her Form, her Heav'nly Form of Pray'rs, What Infidel without Devotion hears! The best that ever Reach'd th'Immortal Ears! Not crudely thought of, and compos'd in hast, But wrole in Words that will like Language last: Solemn, Engaging, Weighty and Divine, Agreeing with, or took from Scripture ev'ry Line. O Holy Composition! Sacred Charm! That can our Minds of all their Fears disarm! O make, at first, then keep our Spirits ever warm That ev'ry time thy Duties we attend, Our Souls may rise, till they at last ascend Where Pray'r and Praises never! never are to end! Yet O unhappy Church! surrounded by So many Sects and Sons of Enmity; And more Unhappy, as shall next be shown, From Faithless Friends and Sons suppos'd her Own; Who yet more Dang'rous Notions have Imbib'd Than all the Knaves and Fools before Describ'd. The Fifth Part. Hail Sacred Mother, Guardian of the Land! Thou stand'st, and may'st thou yet for ever stand: A Nursing Mother Heav'n has rais'd, to be, As thou to us, the same Defence to Thee: What Blessings art thou likely now to Gain From Anna's Gentle, and Auspicious Reign! In her the State and You are doubly best At once the Greatest of her Sex, and best: By all belov'd, by all with Rapture seen! Nor know we which excels the most, the Christian or the Queen. Early thy Sacred Doctrine she Embrac'd, And ever since has held the Blessing fast. What ever Plots against thy Frame combine, They first must reach her Peace to Ruin thine. Ev'n to her own she thy Repose preferrs, As knowing well thy deadliest Foes are hers. A Subject she, thy Rules subjected lay, The Scoff of Atheists and the Secta'ries Prey, Who watch'd thy low Estate, and Justl'd for the Sway; But when her Fortune did, Auspicious, rise (The Care of Heav'n, and Darling of our Eyes! She fill'd the Gap, and stood in our Defence; As great her Pow'r as late her Innocence. And now, securely Seated on the Throne, She Cultivates our Vertues with her own. Forward she Swift to Reformation drives; And, that the Fair may shew it in their Lives She makes her self the Pattern for the Wives; And Copies at one Draught the Lamb and Dove; Like this her Purity and that her Love, Of all the Human Joys we stand Possess'd, The kind the chast Domestick Life is best, And gives the Softest Toils and Sweetest Rest! For where two Hearts meet, just like Tallies, ev'n, 'Tis there we find below a Tast of Heav'n! Such is the Life, and such the happy State Of our Illustrious Princess and her Mate: To Unmolested, Mutual Joys they go, Tho' little Copy'd in their Train below. Not that the Blessings of the Marriage Life Makes her decline the Hero's Martial strife, When a Just Cause, where she has pass'd her Word, Or there where Peace must be by War Restor'd, Bids her Unsheath her slow, unwilling Sword; But ground as keen and as undaunted born, As that by Cyrus, or by Cæsar worn: Nor is her General, for his time, behind Those Hero's in Success and Presence of the Mind: Nor e'er did they, to such a Num'rous Foe, Strike at one Heat a more Decisive Blow. In the Late Reign his Fate refus'd to Rise, Nor had he yet attain'd the Glorious Prize, But for the Influence of a Woman's Eyes! No less Success cou'd he Expect to Meet From so much Worth, and from a Mind so Great! Anew she, thus our Nerves for Conquests strings, As when our Great Plantiagnets were Kings. O Glorious Reign! that ev'ry way Succeeds, And neither Counsel, Men, or Mony needs; But all, officious round about her wait, As truely Good, to make her Truely Great. At home she wou'd our Sons of Strife compose, Abroad she Guards the Nation from our Foes, And still shall Guard, till, with Eliza's Fate, The Gallick falls, as then the Spanish State: A Work Reserv'd by Heav'n for Her alone, To drag th'Audacious Monster from a Throne, Confound their Salique Law, and make the Rule her own. O may that famous Institution there Have now it's just Reverse Establish'd here; That on the British Throne may still be seen A Female Race,—and long the Present Queen; That all w'ave lost her Conduct may Regain, And only Woman! Glorious Woman Reign! Secur'd and blest by such a Sacred Head, What, O Eusebia! can'st thou further dread? I form'd, indeed, but now a Gloomy Scene Of Clouds and Storms; but all is now Serene. By her Example taught their Rage and Spite The Sectaries lose, and in Her Praise unite: Or granting (as we doubt) their Love they feign, You yet are safe in this Auspicious Reign: Not but perhaps (tho' now the View is Rest) It may a Blessing prove to be Oppress'd: Whom Heav'n does love it does with Stripes Chastise; 'Tis hard without Affliction to be Wise. Thus God, perhaps, permits these Knaves and Fools, And long may do, so that the Humbler Souls May cleave, with Thee, the stricter to his Rules, To Conquer all ev'n Isra'el was debarr'd, Their Dang'erous Inmates had some Cities spar'd; Left of set purpose, shou'd they prove Unwise, To goar their Sides, and Prickle in their Eyes: For when that stubborn Nation did offend, 'Twas nothing but Affliction made 'em mend. But as to what thy Faithless Friends impose, What shall we say? or what Defence from those Who at thy very Vitals lie unseen, And darkly Act their treach'rous Parts within? Are they thy Sons who at this Time unite With the High-flying foolish Perkinite? How can a set of Men thy Peace intend Whose Counsels Ruin what thy own Defend? For where is the Religion, or the Sense, Of bringing in a Spurious, Popish Prince, When all the Three Estates (the Legal Sway) Had turn'd the Current quite another Way? Which certainly they never wou'd have done But that they saw the Rocks we ought to shun, Tho' to the Men of shallow reach unknown: Let Fools be to their own Conceits inclin'd; 'Tis God himself that tunes a Nations Mind. What have we then to do but to comply For Conscience sake, with Pow'r and Equity? And fix our future Hope, as late decreed, On that Illustrious House that must Succeed. But first, O let our Interest first be weigh'd! To Anna all our Loves and Vows be paid, And that Succession Ages yet delay'd. In the mean time we see by the Design Of such as wou'd thy safety undermine, That they're Ungrateful Sons;—if they are Sons of Thine. But if so high some of thy Children go There yet are others that descend as low. So hard their Privilege the former Strain, That, if it break not, yet 'tis render'd vain; And these are always for a slacken'd Rein: What ever turn of Government befall, They scarcely ever look, but leap at all. Those think that Oaths beyond their Nature bind, Beyond the Sense for which they were design'd; And these believe they're things beneath a Man to mind. Those to that height advance Monarchal Sway, That, notwithstanding all the Scripture say, It is Damnation yet to disobey. But on this Side there are a sort of Elves So cool, they'd dash their Princess on the Shelves, So in her Ruin they cou'd raise themselves. So odd their Sentiments of Regal Sway, Cou'd they but easy live, and little Pay, Were Noll again to Rule, they'd readily obey. In short the two Contenders (now our Themes) Were still, and will be ever in Extremes. The first to Papal Counsels seems inclin'd And tother's Calvin half, with Luther join'd. Thy Moderation Vehemently they blame, But that's no Christian Truth, that is not still the same. Mean while we see, tho' they will never joyn In ought beside, they in thy Fall combine; So are but Treach'rous Sons,—if Sons at all of thine. Others among thy Prelates may be found That nothing else but Comprehension sound; And to that end Destructive Tracts prepare, That give thy Sanctions quite another Air: Thy very Articles themselves they seize, And make 'em speak whatever Sense they please; Such as in Scripture can't be found, if sought, And what their first Compilers never thought. With Schemes of Latitude they court the Rout, Which follow'd, soon wou'd bring this Change about, To let the Sectaries in, and drive thy Vot'ries out. Thou that the best of Churches now we own, Wou'dst then be found the very worst,—or None. 'Tis to be wish'd, indeed, that all Mankind In matters of Belief were always of one Mind: But since below w'are never like to see A Perfect, Universal Unitie; A Bliss reserv'd for the bright Realms above, Where all is Rapture, Purity and Love, Or for the bless'd Milennium; (if so be Our Hope of that is not a Fallacie;) What can we think of those, but that they err, Who wou'd by Anarchy erect it here? And quite dissolve thy Principles and Rules, To flatter Villains and encourage Fools? Denying Entrance is, they cry, a Sin, Pull down, and let at once the Sectaries in; Why is your Stubborn Will the Cruel Cause So many Brethren break the Sacred Laws? Remove the Fence, that Justice may prevail; Nor keep so many Souls without the Pale. Forbid it God, 'tis answer'd, we shou'd be Justly accus'd of such Barbarity; Let 'em Retract their Errors; when 'tis done, Both they and we will be for ever one. But here they Answer:—What You bid them do Is a most Glorious Work reserv'd for You: The Points they argue are of Highest Weight, You only for Indiffe'rent Things debate; There all your Arguments and Stress You lay; By Rigidness You move, by Conscience they; The things they'd have you grant 'em are but small, And lay those by, You have 'em at a Call; Your Duty's, then, to make Concessions to 'em all. That ever Men so Positive shou'd be Their Cause is Truth, when 'tis Conspiracy! But that at once, we may the Point discuss, Are we gone out from them, or they from us? If they from us, then thence this Answer springs, 'Tis they that break about Indifferent things. As to the Points that we with them debate, We'll prove 'em of the highest Force and Weight; And that if those Concessions they desire Our Church shou'd grant, she must of Course expire; Or if she did exist, she cou'd but be A Complication of Absurdity, Made up at once of Christian, Turk and Jew; A Thousand Tenets false, for one that's true. For Proof, to please the bold Socinian, We first must own our Saviour meerly Man. With the Perverse Fanatick to comply, We must abolish next, our Liturgy. To joyn the Quakers, e'er it can be done We must at once both Sacraments disown; Make Truth an Unintelligible Din, And call abusive Nonsense Light within. To come up to the Baptist, Women, Men, Must all Consent to be Baptiz'd again, Or pass, at best, but for a Heathen Race, Till by Immersion they have div'd for Grace. In short to please 'em all of ev'ry Station, We must Renounce our Pow'r of Ordination; Leave ev'ry Man his Errors to Instill, To Hear, Believe, and Worship what he will, Till Truth and Purity are Banish'd quite, And all to salve that specious Word,—Unite. Well did the Graver (waving the abuse) Picture the Church of England like a Goose; The Sectaries all around with Haggard Hair, Pulling the Feathers off to make her bare; And on her Head the Jesuits and their Train With Bills like Woodcocks, pecking at her Brain: For such, O British Church! thou surely art, If from thy Needful Barriers thou dost part, Set up to Guard thee from a Lawless Rout, Who wou'd get in but just to drive thee out. In short a Comprehension to Design, Be who they will that in the Project joyn, Does prove 'em Treach'rous Sons,—if Sons at all of Thine. Others there are in Sacerdotal Wear, That quite Disgrace their Sacred Character; In Sports and Revels they their Time employ, As they were made for Laughter, Love and Joy. But slenderly those Sons observe thy Rules That only herd with Women and with Fools, And totally forgets—his Cure of Souls. Another does his Scripture Theme disgrace, And makes a Pulpit War with Hudibrass: (Poor Hudibrass! to whom they grudg'd his Bread, Neglected Living, and revile him dead:) A Third in Taverns passes half his Days, Or runs disguis'd to Brothels and to Plays. How oft, O London! in thy Streets is found (Thy Streets which so with Pimps and Punks abound!) The Youthful Teacher picking up the Trull, Regardless of his Coat—and more than Fool! Others thy Coffee Conventicles Use, And run distracted after Lyes and News, When any needy Hawker if they please, Wou'd ev'ry Day, and for a Penny fees, Bring to their House the cure of that Disease. They'll urge, perhaps, they may Diversion use; And any just Diversion we excuse: To Walk, to Ride, to visit Learned Friends, Is what the Muse not blames, but Recommends. But what in their Defence can any say, Who, Farmer like, clad in a Coat of Grey, And long Cravat, ne'er miss a Market Day? That Corn and Beeves, and Managing their Ground Make their Employment all the Year around; As if there were no laymen in the Way To rent their Glebe, and make 'em Honest Pay? Mean while their Books (where safely they reside) The Dust does cover and the Cobwebs hide; Their Unfrequented Studies Silence Rules, And leaves to their Pursuit the Muck of Fools. What e'er they to their Families design, With those we nam'd before we these may join; All very shameless Sons,—at least if Sons of Thine. As these the Church now under our debate, Some Laicks are as fatal to the State; And may be, secularly, understood Always Dissenting from the Publick Good: That from the Crown Prerogative wou'd tear, The Oldest and the Brightest Jewel there. Not that the Muse the English does deny To be Tenacious of their Liberty: Far be our Conduct from those slavish Souls Whom Lewis by his Lawless Pow'r controuls: Licking the Dust, they tremble to the spurn, As only made to serve a Tyrant's turn. So little they of Human Comforts share, What we call Property is Treason there: Nor yet the Subject his Condition rues, Tho' nothing's left but want and Wooden Shooes. Fertile their Land, yet on Brown George they Dine, And Drink but Water tho' they Swim in Wine. A tedious Slav'ery thus, by Proof, we find Conveys its base Effects into the Mind, Till it at last forgets, or will not see The Gain of Trade, and Sweets of Liberty: Or that when e'er a Nation has the Will To shake a Tyrant off that Governs ill, That wou'd their Laws Subvert, and Rights devour, That Will can never be without the Pow'r: How can the Art or Strength of One Prevail Against whole Millions in the other Scale? Unhappy People! that of Conquest boast, When all they get is to their Tyrant lost! Never before did Gallia know a Reign, That bled 'em ev'ry Purse and ev'ry Vein: But Patient, and for Asses only meant, Implicit they obey; alike Content With Cheats of Faith, and Cheats of Government. More madly yet the Briton plays his Game; Much better us'd and so the more to blame. A Restless Mind amid'st our S?te reigns, Either still Fearing, or Imposing Chains; And Chains, perhaps, we all might quickly wear, Were not our Rights become a Wiser Care; For 'tis the L?ds who, hating to Enslave, Preserve our Liberties to keep us Brave; While standing as a Barrier, or a Tow'r, Between our Tribunes and the Kingly Pow'r, They from the Insults of either keep us free, When these wou'd clip Prerogative, or that our Property: For King and Commons, in their first Intent, Are the two Scales of British Government; But Scales that soon wou'd err to an extreme, Did not the Nobles fix and pin the Beam: A Counterpoize, when e'er the Storm is Great, To trim the Vessel, and to save the State: Not that this Character of all is meant; For some there are that never were Content With any Prince, or any Government. O happy Constitution! on a Frame Establish'd that wou'd Ages last the same, But for the Pride and Rancour of a few Who wou'd dissolve, and cast it all anew. To Wicked Men all things alike are just, If this Promote their Spite, or that their Lust: Perish the Nation, let the French Succeed, So but the Beau can Whore and Glutton feed; Or Bumkin Members, at the Vine or Rose, Can Tost at once their Mistress, and their Nose; Then home returning raise their Tenants rent To make amends for Sums profusely spent. Where yet much worse their Senses they expose To tell the Reasons of their Ay's and No's, Which tho' but Speeches short, have yet the Weight, If Misapply'd, to Ruin Church and State. Men so Entrusted shou'd to Truth be bent, And have clear Thoughts to Judge of the Event. But these are a Morose and sensual Rout, All Mute within, and endless, Chat without: Their Wit, Detraction; Honesty, Disguise; As Bessus, Brave; and their Electors, Wise: Thoughtless of Right, or Wrong; and not Content With Law, Religion, Prince, or Government. But as these six on Methods Lewd and Vain, Another Class are all for Pow'r and Gain: These are the Men the Nation most shou'd doubt That thrive within, and starve the Fools without; Their Master, Herd; whose Fleece they ev'ry Year Take off, and in the Publick Pocket share What we ev'n Groan to see, and they shou'd blush to hear. What Care can of the Common Good be shown, Where most have separate Interests of their Own? He that on self Advancement does depend Directs his Counsels only to that End. If Father S?r (who abounds with Gall, At once disdaining, and disdain'd by all,) At any time a Party-Friend can serve, He cares not if a Thousand Worthier starve; Oblig'd so far, they'll any Dangers face; And Vote to keep themselves and Him in Place: While the Gull'd Country part with all their store To pay them Pensions but to Tax it more. And yet ev'n these, if once got out of Grace, (Loyal no longer than they keep in Place, And H? himself's an Instance of the Case,) They Rave! they! Rail and will not be Content With Law, Religion, Prince, or Government. We grant indeed that, mixt with these, there are Some Worthy Men, who all self-interest bar: So Wealthy, that they'll Nothing base advance, So Honest, as to Curse the Bribes of France. At once both to their King and Country true, The Mutual Good of either they pursue, And Lives and Fortunes cheerfully wou'd set To make one Prospe'rous and the other Great. Their Counsels always to our Glory tend Sharp to discern, and ready to defend. And yet, Alas! what Common Good can rise From those that are Sagacious, Just and Wise, When the dead Weight of Number shall prevail, Tho' Law and Gospel lie in 'tother Scale? In vain the Poor on Innocence depends; Justice is there Majority of Friends. What can we from the Martyr's Fate infer But a sad Instance that the most may Err? In ev'ry Age we find that Men are Men; And some are now as bad as others then. Wou'd it not grieve the Heart and shock the Ear That Feuds and Factions shou'd be cherish'd there Where they are sent but only to agree, And keep the Land as Friendly, as 'tis Free? Which way can Heats, that ev'ry Year encrease, Be argu'd to promote the Publick Peace? If Parties strive, tho' this, or that Succeed, It is the People that both Pay, and Bleed. In the late Times the Royalists Pretence For cutting Throats was to defend their Prince; The Godly Army, Thirsting after Blood, Plunder'd and Murder'd for their Countries Good. The Knaves of either Party play'd the Game, While their trim Speakers (and w'ave yet the same) In S?te were the Breath that fann'd the Flame. Can true and false be one? or Love and Hate? No less can Peace and Factions in a State. Accurs'd be they that sit in safety there And thence eject the Seeds of Strife and War, Which falling on the People, up there Springs Two Parties, this, their Countries: that their Kings: But were the Cause by Justice to be try'd, And the true Means for Publick Peace apply'd, The Hot-heads shou'd be Hang'd on either Side, That others may be warn'd to rest Content With the true Line, and Legal Government. Where can the Good of Separate Interest be? Can it be fatal not to disagree? Or do they think (because it is agreed That, now and then, a Vein may Breathing need) The Body Politick for Health must Bleed? As sure it will, unless some speedy Care Is took, such Jehu's may not drive too far: W'are to the utmost Verge of Danger run, And must be now United or Undone. For some there are, like Junius Brutus sour, That wou'd at once all Regal Right devour, And some, again, are for Unbounded Pow'r. Some wou'd a Scheme of Rule from Holland draw, And some wou'd have the Sword of Lewis, Law. Others to Tracts of Rome and Greece repair For some old Forms, and wou'd new vamp 'em here. Some wou'd as useless have the L?ds laid by, The Gloomy Politicks of Anarchy! Others from Faction do this Inference draw, That 'tis a Balance to keep Kings in awe, Confin'd by that within the Bounds of Law; So raise a Danger nothing can suppress Only to make their fear of Danger less; The very last Extreme of Sottishness! Thus while all Parties each with each contend, They do but widen what they're call'd to mend. Ev'n in Debate they can't forbear to bite, On this side Rancour and on that 'tis Spite, And all have Friends to say they Voted Right. From this Spring-head of Interest and Ill-will, Does all their Venom on the Mob distill, Till we, at once, can rife amongst 'em see Revenge, and Guile, and Fear, and Jealousie: Nor less does Pride, Hypocrisy and Hate Inflame the Gentry, and disturb the State: Inward Convulsions in her Breast she feels, And tho' she does not Fall, she often Reels. All sorts of Rabble, Mouth to fill the Cry, And Roar, and Thrust, and Swell, and Mutiny, If any Publick News but go awry. The very Sweepers of the Jayls and Halls, The Inhabitants of Cellars, Bulks and Stalls, Carmen and Coblers, Scavengers, a Rout That will but look in Hell as now without; All, Copying from their Patrons, vent aloud The base dislike of an Ungrateful Crowd; And not of Thousands scarce is one Content With any Prince, or any Government. But throw, my Muse, a Veil upon our Fau'ts, And throw, beside another on thy Thoughts; Shou'd you speak more it might be dang'rous here;— So pass on now to Rascals less our Fear. TO The Right Honourable CHARLES, Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, &amp;c. With leave at last to come to Publick view, This Trifle for a Refuge flies to You; To You, my Lord, in whom we best can see What ev'ry Other British Peer shou'd be: Firm to their Honour, to their Prince sincere, Kind to Desert, the Poor their Daily Care; But to the Fawning Sycophant, severe: 'Tis Him we ought to fear of all Mankind, For only Mischief Animates his Mind: The sweetest Accents hide the sharpest Gall, And 'twas a charming Outside damn'd us all. But such You Scorn, and with Contempt repell;— Less charge a Coach and Six, than using Flatt'rers well. The Man that nobly strives to raise his Name By making Worth the Centre of his Aim, Can never miss of an Establish'd Fame: He marks the Vices that disgrace the Age, Flutter to Court, and flourish on the Stage, And shuns 'em all; ties up the Clam'rous Tongue, And rescues Injur'd Honesty from Wrong. This is the Man to whom our Praise is due; And this Man treads in the same Path with You. There hardly ever was so good a thing But felt th'Envenom'd Point of Envy's Sting; Seldom she meddles with Inferiour Game; But Truth and Sense are her Inveterate Aim. Yet here we may (as 'twere by Heav'n design'd) say more of You than of all Humankind; Y'are Envy Proof; and so is all Y'ave Writ; For no Man e'er was so presuming, yet, To fix a Brand on Your Unquestion'd Wit. So Good! I dare ev'n hope You will excuse This rude Address of my Illiterate Muse, What Greater Proof?—Who in Return will raise Her Wings above the usual Pitch to sing her Patron's Praise. Your Actions, in their very Rise, confess'd They took their being from a Generous Breast: A Breast that all the full blown Worth displays That can Transmit a Name to after Days: Your easy Converse and Instructive Mind (This always Vertuous, That as much Refin'd) Made up of all the Charms that can Delight Mankind. Ready to Pardon Enemies their Crimes, And strictly Loyal in Rebellious Times: Then 'tis He who a Heart unshaken brings Is touch'd, found right, and fit for Glorious Things; Stands Bulwark in the Gap, and ev'n Obliges Kings. Reflecting on all this, how dare I bring To Your strict View so mean an Offering? Yet since 'tis only Truth, perhaps you may In its Perusal throw an hour away. For here, my Lord, You'll meet with Knaves Chastis'd Buffoons and Bullies, equally despis'd: Ill Plays and Doggrel Poets damn'd in shoals, With their Admirers, Women, Fops and Fools. But this, perhaps, might make its Value less, And for the Publick thought too fit a Dress; For Truth does least of all Employ the Press. I am, My LORD, Your Lordships most Humble and truly devoted Servant R. Gould. THE PLAY-HOUSE A SATYR. The First Part. Since of all things which at this Guilty Time Have felt the honest Satyrs wholsom Rhime The Impious Play-House has been most forborn, (Tho' it of all Things most deserves our Scorn) We'll do at last what Justice does require; And strip it bare of all the Gay Attire Which Women love and Fools so much admire. Aid me, Ye Scorpions with Inveterate Spite, Instruct me how to stab with ev'ry Word I write; Or if my Pen's too weak this Tyde to stem, Lend me Your Stings, and I will wound with them: Each home-set thrust shall pierce the vitious Heart, And draw the Poison from th'envenom'd Part; Lash ev'ry Fop and ev'ry Drab expose, And to the World a hideous Scene disclose: While the Proud Mimicks who now Lord it so, Become the Publick hiss where-e'er they go, Their Trade decay and they unpitied Starve; A better Fate than most of 'em deserve. The Middle Galle'ry first demands our View; The filth of Jakes, and stench of ev'ry Stew! Here reeking Punks like Ev'ning Insects swarm; The Polecat's Perfume much the Happier Charm. Their very Scent gives Apoplectick Fits, And yet they're thought all Civit by the Cits; Nor can we blame 'em; for the Truth to tell, The want of Brains may be the want of Smell. Here ev'ry Night they sit three Hours for Sale; The Night-rail always cleanlier than the Tayl. If any Gudgeon bites they have Him sure, For nothing Angles Blockheads like a Whore. Discreet in this, their Faces not to shew; The Mask the best Complexion of the two. Their Noses falling and their Eyes sunk in, A wrinkl'd Forehead and a Parchment Skin: Their Breath as hot as Ætna's Sulph'rous Fire; Yet cold as Ice compar'd with their Desire. The Physick each has singly swallow'd up, Produc'd again, wou'd stock ev'n Chase's Shop. Yet such as these our Modern Fops admire; Perhaps to be Inur'd for hotter Fire. A Woman's ne'er so Wicked, but she can Find one as Wicked, or much worse in Man, To satisfy her Lust, obey her Will, And at her Nod perform the greatest Ill: These ride not Strumpets, but are Strumpet-rid, And Dog-like, fetch and carry as they're bid; But, naming Dogs, did You yet ever meet A proud Bitch and her Gallants in the Street? Shock, Mastiff, Mungrel, Spaniel Blithe and Gay With Brandish'd Tails, and panting e'er their Prey, Have You observ'd with what Obsequious Art They make their Court? So Am'rous at the Heart, The more their Mistress snarls the less inclin'd to part. This is an Emblem of our Gall'ry Ware, The Scene we may see Nightly Acted here Not but we must give Dog and Bitch their due, As much the Chaster Creatures of the two; Their Season past they're cool;—'tis only here The Commerce holds, Insatiate, all the Year. About one Jilt a Hundred Apes shall move, And which is strange, at once all Chatt'ring Love: So loud the Din, that who the Play wou'd hear Might be as well Inform'd at Home, as there. At last they to the An adjacent Tavern. Rose direct their Way (It's Staple Trade such Customers as they) To end th'Intrigue agreed on at the Play. Luxurious, there they Gormandize at large, And all at the Licentious Cully's Charge; Till drain'd both Purse and Chine he does retire, And within three Days finds He's all on Fire: The total, thus, of all Venereal Jobs Begin in Whore, and Terminate in A famous Surgeon. Hobs. If he wou'd find the Nymph that caus'd his Moan, He toils in vain,—the Bird of Night is flown: Yet not this warning makes the Sot give o'er, He must repeat the Dang'rous Bliss once more, But still finds harder Usage than before. Hence 'tis our Surgeons and our Quacks are grown To make so great a Figure in the Town; Heaping up large Estates by our Debauches; Our keeping Strumpets makes them keep their Coaches: Their Consorts so Extravagantly Gay, You in their Dress behold their Husband's Pay: But backward look, you'll find it is the Stage That makes these Locusts swarm upon the Age: There 'tis the fruitful Bane is plough'd and till'd, But these have all the Harvest of the Field. There's many of 'em for their single Share, Pocket, 'tis said, some Thousands ev'ry Year: Nor is it strange in such a spreading Crime, Where half the Town is Fluxing at a Time: Wide as the Grave to take its Comers in, Their Gates stand open for the Sons of Sin: But then the Tales deliver'd out again, Just as the Parson has his One in Ten: And they so pale and Meagre, you'd swear A Ghost were Weightier, tho they're nought but Air. So craving too are these Pox-Emp'ricks grown. Live ye, or Die, they make the Cash their own. Expensive Malady! where People give More to be kill'd than many wou'd to live! Some get Estates when others drop, but here The very Dying does undo the Heir. O that the custom were again Return'd, That Bodies might on Funeral Piles be burn'd The Pestilential Vapours which the Sun Sucks from the Ground, and thro' the Air are thrown, Giving all Catching Plagues and Fevers Birth, Are only Steams Exhal'd from Pocky Earth: From whence this Town we may conclude accurst, For here few Die but are half Rotten first. Nor is this Middle Gall'ry only found With Drabs of Common Trading to abound; But, to the Eternal Scandal of their Race, Her Honour often, and as oft her Grace Sail hither, Mask'd and Muffl'd in Disguise; And with pert Carriage and their smart Replies Set all the Men agog, who strait agree They must of course, be Punks of Quality; So lead 'em off to give their Longings vent, For 'tis presum'd they came for that Intent: At least, if not for common Use, t'employ Some Friend assign'd, and take their Swill of Joy. How often, Cl?d, hast thou here been found By a Lascivious Herd encompass'd round? How often have you hence retir'd, and lain A Leash of Stallions breathless on the Plain? Then back return'd; another Leash enjoy'd; Another after that, when those were cloy'd; And so elsewhere, and here, has half your Life employ'd. Till not a Drab appears in History, So Shameless and Libidinous as Thee. Scarce does an Ev'ning pass thro' all the Year, But many of the highest Rank are here: True, if discover'd, for a blind they'll say, They only came to take a strict Survey If Whores cou'd be so bad as some Report;— And that they might as well have known at Court. But they're but Flesh, and 'tis in vain to rail, Since fed the higher 'tis the oftner frail. Withold, ye Citizens, Your Wives from hence, If You'd Preserve their Fame and Innocence, You else are sure to live in Cuckold's Row; There is not yet one Precedent to show Our Wives by coming here can Vertuous grow: That Plays may make 'em Vitious, Truth assures; Especially, so much Inclin'd as Yours. The London Cuckolds they all Flock to see, And Triumph in their Infidelity: In vain Your Counsel;—Nothing can reclaim A Wife that once has shaken Hands with Shame. If e'er they take their Ply th'Adult'rous Way, The Devil may as soon recant as they: To sure Destruction wilfully they run; In View of Hell, and yet go daring on. Choak't with the stench of Brimstone, 'twill be fit To Visit next the Boxes and the Pit, And for the Muse a Nobler Scene prepare, And let Her breathe awhile in Milder Air. But such a sudden Glare invades her Eyes, So vast a Crowd of diffe'rent Vanities, She knows where not to fix her Rancour first; So very Wicked all, that all are worst! Here painted Ladies, aiming at the Heart, Their Graces Arm, and all their Charms exert: Dress'd, one and all, with Nice Exactness there, But Mobb'd like Dowdies at the House of Prayer. How diffe'rent will the Scene at Night be shown! When they restore to ev'ry Box it's Own, When like themselves th'affrighting Things appear, Divested of their Patches, Gemms and Hair: This sight th'Obsequious Coxcombs shou'd attend; Like a Death's Head 'twou'd warn 'em of their End: But they, alas! for vainer things design'd, Fix here their Hopes and Nothing Future Mind. Between the Acts they to the Boxes throng, With Whining Voices warbling each his Song: Their Own, You may besure; for none but such Can write what cou'd Delight that Sex so much. Some few soft Lines (but such as well express Their Wit is as much Borrow'd as their Dress) Does set 'em up for Poets; all their Time Supinely trifl'd off in Love and Rhime. These are the Womens Men, their dear Delight; For just as Ladies Chatter, Coxcombs write. Not far from hence, another much distress'd, At once makes Cupid and himself a Jest: With a low Cringe, Her Vanity to Please, He Drawls his Passion in such Terms as these. MADAM! by Heav'n You have an Air so Fine, It renders the least thing You do—Divine! We dare not say You were Created here, But dropt an ANGEL from th'ÆTHEREAL SPHERE! Ten Thousand CUPIDS on Your FORE-HEAD Sit, And shoot resistless Darts thro' all the PIT. Before Your Feet, see! Your Adorers lie, Live, if You Smile; and if You Frown, they die! Ev'n I, Your true Predestinated Slave, Rather than meet Your Hate wou'd meet my Grave: Ah! Pity then, Bright Nymph the Wound You gave! Thus sighs the Sot, thus tells his Am'rous Tale, And thinks his florid Nonsense must prevail; Bows, and withdraws: And next to prove his Love, Steals up, and Courts the Fulsome Punks above. Mean while the Nymph, proud of her Conquest, looks Big as Wreath'd Poets in the Front of Books; Surveys the Pit with a Majestick Grace, To see who falls a Victim to her Face; Does in her Glass her self with Wonder view, And fancies all the Coxcomb said was true. Hence 'tis the Whiffling, Vain, Fantastick Chit Is the Fair Ladies only Man of Wit. With Servile Flatt'ry sleeking his Address, Where e'er he goes, he's certain of Success. Speak Truth to our fine Women, and you'll find, Of all things, That the least can make 'em kind: Nor can we blame 'em; for it calls 'em plain, Deceitful, Idle, Foolish, Fond and Vain. Wit in a Lover more than Death they fear; For only Witty Men can tell what Trash they are. But a pert, airy, empty, Noisy Ass, In their Esteem does all his Sex Surpass: Believ'd a Hero, tho' by Heav'n design'd The Grin of Wit, and Scandal of his Kind. Such Giddy Insects here for ever come, And very little Dare, but much Presume: Perpetually the Ladies Ears they ply, And Whisper Slander at the Standers by: Then laugh aloud; which now is grown a part Of Play-house Breeding, and of Courtly Art. The true Sign of Your Modish Beau Garson Is Chatt'ring like a Ladies lewd Baboon, Shewing their Teeth to charm some pretty Creature; For grinning, among Fops, is held a Feature. Nor is this all; they are so oddly dress'd, As if they'd sworn to be a standing Jest, Ap'd into Men for Pastime to the Rest. Observe 'em well, You'll think their Bodies made T'attend the Empty Motions of the Head; If that but wags the whole Machine does move, From top to Toe devoted all to Love. Their Whigs and Steinkirks to that height refin'd, They dare not tempt their Enemy—the Wind; Of the least slender puff each Sot affraid is, It kills the Curls design'd to kill the Ladies. So stiff they are, in all Parts ty'd so strait, 'Tis strange to me the Blood shou'd Circulate. But leaving these Musk-Cats to publick Shame, I'll turn my Head and seek out other Game. In the Side-Box Moll Hinton You may see, Or Howard Moll, much wickeder than she; That is their Throne; for there they best Survey All the Young Fops that flutter to the Play. So known, so Courted, in an Hour, or less, You'll see a Hundred making their Address; Bow, Cringe and Leer, as supple Poets do, The Patron's Guineas shining in their View: While they, Promiscuous, let their Favours fall, And give the same Incouragement to all. Harlots of all things shou'd be most abhorr'd, And in the Play-house nothing's more ador'd: In that lewd Mart the rankest Trash goes off, Tho' rotten to the Core, and Death to Cough; Tho' Ulcers on their Lungs as thick take Place As Firey Pimples on a Drunkards Face. Discharg'd of these, observe another way The Fops in Scarlet swearing at the Play: Nor yet unduly they themselves acquit, For Fustian on the Stage, too, goes for Wit. A Harmless Jest, or Accidental Blow, Spilling their Snuff, or touching but the Toe, With many other things too small to name, Does blow these Sparks of Honour to a Flame: For such vile Trifles, or some Viler Drab, 'Tis in an Instant Damn me, and a Stab. No mild Perswasion can these Brutes reclaim; 'Tis thus to Night, to Morrow 'tis the same. What a long List might Justice here Produce Of Blood, of Fighting, Banning and Abuse? What Weekly Bill, for Number, can compare To those that have been basely Butcher'd here, Within the Compass but of Twenty Year? One Actress has at least, to name no more, Been her own self the Slaughter of a Score. Murder's so Rife, with like Concern we hear Of a Man kill'd, as Baiting of a Bear. All People now, the Place is grown so ill, Before they see a Play shou'd make their Will: For with much more Security, a Man Might take a three Years Voyage to Japan. Here others, who no doubt believe they're Witty, Are hot at Repartee with Orange Betty: Who, tho' not blest with half a Grain of Sense To Leven her whole Lump of Impudence, Aided by that, perpetually's too hard For the vain Fops, and beats 'em from their Guard: When fearing the Observing few may carp, They laughing cry, egad the Jade was Sharp: Who'd think with Banter she shou'd Us outdo? Nay more, be found the better Punster too? When, without Boasting we may safely Swear We thought w'ad gain'd the Height of what these Arts cou'd bear. Yet these true Owphs wou'd think it an Offence More than all Human Wit cou'd Recompence, Not to be rank't among the Men of Sense. Were selfish Coxcombs truely what they thought, They'd first be Gods, and next with Incense sought. But 'tis a Truth, fixt in Apollo's Rules, Your Wou'd-be-Wits are but the Van of Fools; The very same that we in Armies find; The Apes in Office worse than all behind: Who tho' they fiercely look and loudly roar, A Game Cock's Feather wou'd outweigh a score. Another Set together whispering run, Where they may best Debauch when Farce is done: Th'Agreement made, out Pander'us whips before To bespeak Musick, Supper, Wine and Whore: There they till Midnight Soak, and Cram and Drench, The Bumper now in Use, and now the Wench. Top-full at last, away they Scow'ring run, And leave no Mischief in their Pow'r undone. The Cries of Martyr'd Watchmen now You'll hear, As soon, Demolish'd Windows clattering there. Whose ever Fate it is to walk the Street, And with these Bullies and their Harlots meet, They must avoid, or else be sure to feel Deep in their Lungs some Villains fatal Steel; Villain, I say, that for a Cause so small As not t'Uncap, or reeling to the Wall, And yet much oftner for no Cause at all, Shall those poor Innocents of Life disarm, That neither Spoke, Design'd, or wish'd 'em harm. Like any Hero these will Foam and Fight, When they're urg'd on by Strumpet or by Spite; But if their King and Country claim their Aid, As none cou'd threaten more, there's none so much afraid. Not One will move, not one his Prowess show, But stand stock still, when Honour bids 'em go. A Hundred Others, had they but their due, Of such as these, we shou'd expose to view; But, with what's past, too feelingly perplext, We'll shew the Crimes of Plays and Players next. The Second Part. No longer in the Streets, my Muse, appear, But back, a Fury, to the Play-house steer; We have not yet, done half our Bus'ness there. A Thousand Crimes, already, we've expos'd, A Thousand more remain, not yet disclos'd. On boldly then, nor fear to miss your Aim; Don't want for Rage, and we can't want for Theme. Here a Cabal of Criticks you may see, Discoursing of Dramatick Poesie. While one, and he the wittiest of the Gang, (By whom you'll guess how fit they're all to hang) Shall entertain you with this learn'd Harangue. They talk of Ancient Plays, that they are such, So Good, they ne'er can be admir'd too much: 'Tis all an Error.—In our present Days, I grant, we've many claim Immortal Praise. The Cheats of Scapin, One; A Noble Thing; What a throng'd Audience does it always bring! The Emp'rour of the Moon, 'twill never tire; The same Fate has the fam'd Alsatian Squire. Not Jevon's Learned Piece has more Pretence Than these, to Fancy, Language and Good Sense. And here, my Friends, I'd have it understood The Age is nice; what pleases must be Good. Again, for Instance, that clean Piece of Wit The City Heiress, by chast Sappho Writ: Where the Lewd Widow comes, with Brazen Face, Just reeking from a Stallion's rank Embrace T'acquaint the Audience with her Filthy Case. Where can you find a Scene for juster Praise, In Shakespear, Johnson, or in Fletcher's Plays? The Modest Poet always will be Dull; For what is Desdemona but a Fool? Our Plays shall tell you, if the Husband's ill, The more the Wife may prosecute her Will. If jealous, they must date Revenge from thence, And make 'em Cuckolds, in their own Defence. A Hundred others we might quickly name, Where the Success and the Design's the same; Writ purposely th'Unwary to entice, Enervate Goodness, and encourage Vice: And that the Suffrage of both Sexes wins: But see! The Curtains rise, the Play begins. Thus holds the Ideot forth;—the other Sparks Applaud, and hug him for his Wise Remarks; Swear that such things must ev'ry Humour fit, And Universally be Clap'd for Wit; But most the Ladies please; who here are taught That Truth's a Sham and Lewdness not a Fau't; That Wit, is Infamy on Worth to fix; And an Unblemish'd Fame, a Coach and Six. But let the Flatt'rer feed their Endless Pride, And, if he please, all their Desires beside; Here let 'em with their Utmost Lustre Shine, Believ'd by Coxcombs and themselves Divine; To those that clearly see, and rightly know, 'Tis all Destructive Glare, and hideous show: The true Renown which all the rest Exceeds, Is that which is Deriv'd from Vert'ous Deeds. What a fine Set of Criticks all the while Are these? and what the Audience that can smile At things so mean, Ridiculous and Vile? Farce has of late almost o'erwhelm'd the Stage; But foolish Writers suit a foolish Age: Our topping Authors oft descend so low, That Hains and Ho?rd pass for Poets too! How can Instruction from their Works proceed Whom 'tis a Mortal Breach of Wit to read? Not but we grant they yet Admirers gain— But such as have the Rickets in the Brain; A weakly Race who only Judge by Rote, And have no Sense to tast a Beauteous Thought: Thus heavy Fops the heaviest Authors prize:— But at the Theatre the fair Disguise Deceives the Brave, the Witty and the Wise: Struck with the Presence of so bright a Show, They like the Punk, tho' they despise the Beau. 'Tis hard for Youth and Beauty to escape Destruction, dress'd in such a pleasing shape: It gilds their Ruin with a specious Baite, Too quckly Swallow'd and observ'd too late; Too late their Perish'd Vertue to recall— There is no rising from so sad a Fall! Their Fate the worst the more they have of Sense, For Wit does deepliest Rue the loss of Innocence. Nor only Farce; our Plays alike are Writ With neither Manners, Modesty, or Wit, Rais'd with their Authors, to the last Excess Of Irreligion, Smut and Beastliness. Not that I'd have You think I'm so severe To damn all Plays; that wou'd absurd appear: Beside, of Writers, some adorn the Stage, And Southern is the Credit of his Age: In short, I court the Good, and loath the Ill, Let the Presuming Bard be who he will. Tho' a Lord Write, I'll not at Random Praise, Or flatter Dr?n tho' he wear the Bays: Or court fair Sappho in her Wanton fit, When she'd put Luscious Bawdry off for Wit: Or pity B?ks in Tatters, when I know 'Twas his bad Poetry that Cloath'd him so: Or Commend Durf?y to Indulge his Curse; Fond to write on, yet Scribble worse and worse: Or Cr?n for blaming Coxcombs, when I see Sir Courtly's not a vainer Fop than He: Or think that Ra?ft for Wise can pass, When Mother Dobson says he is an Ass; That damn'd, ridiculous, insipid Farce! Or write a Panegyrick to the Fame Of Sh?d?l, or of Starving Set?'s Name, Who have abus'd, unpardonable things, The best of Governments, and best of Kings. But Thee, my Otway, from the Grave I'll raise, And crown thy Mem'ry with Immortal Praise; At least, Sweet Bard, it shou'd Immortal be, If I cou'd reach the Clouds, and Charm the Ear like thee! Thy Orphan and Venetian Piece Sublime Shall ever stand, and dare the Teeth of Time. Th'Ammonian Youth and Mithridates, LEE In spite of thy Unhappy Lunacy, Shall yield another Deathless Name to thee. But honest Truth obliges me to tell, Your other Tragick Plays are not so well; Not with that ease and that Exactness writ, With less of Nature too;—and Nature here is Wit: Not but they may assume a decent Pride To vye ev'n with our Noblest Plays beside. The Name of Etheridge next renown'd we see For easy Stile, and Wit in Comedy, Tho' not so strong as that of Wycherley: His Play of Plain Dealer. Manly (ne'er to be out-writ) A Prodigy of Satyr, Sense and Wit! In all the Characters so just and true, It will be ever fam'd, and ever New! And justly with the rest our Laureat claims To take his Place among Immortal Names: For Oedipus (tho' Sophocles and Lee Share something of the Praise, but not so much as He) Our Fear and Pity does advance as high As ever yet was done in Tragedy. His All for Love, and most Correct of all, Of just and vast Applause can never fail, Never! but when his Limberham I name I hide my head and blush with Friendly shame, To think the Author of both these the same: So thick the Smut is spread in ev'ry Page, 'Twas Actually the Brothel of the Stage. If (as some Criticks fancy) Witty 'tis, It shou'd be fluxt for the Obscene Disease: For as the Pox to ev'ry Part does go, So that's with Lewdness tainted thro' and thro'. Not but sometimes He to the Clouds does rise, And sails at pleasure thro' the Boundless Skies: Born up on Indefatigable Wings, He greatly thinks and as Divinely Sings.— But then his Plays in Rhime (with all their Rules) Only chime in the Women, and their Fools, Who see with Joy their Favourite Ebb and Flow, Now above Reason, and as soon below: This part they Great, and that they Tender call; When first to last 'tis, oft, Unnatural all. His Hero, too, outdoes all Homer's Gods; For 'tis a turn of State when e'er he Nodds. Thus tho' in Time and Place they boast their Skill, For Five good Poets there's Five Hundred Ill. Fly then the reading Plays so vain as these; Such Jingling Authors nor Instruct, nor Please. But if with Profit you wou'd reap Delight, Lay Shakespear, Ben, and Fletcher in Your sight: Where Human Actions are with Life express'd, Vertue advanc'd, and Vice as much depress'd. There the kind Lovers with such Zeal complain, You in their Eyes behold their inmost Pain, And pray such Truth may not be Plac'd in vain. There Natures secret Springs may all be view'd, And, when she doubles, how to be pursu'd. There Art, in all her subtle Shifts display'd, There ev'ry Humour You may see pourtray'd, From Legislative Fops down to the Slaves of Trade. There all the Passions, weak, you'll first espy, Hate, Envy, Fear, Revenge and Jealousy; And by what Fewel fed to flame at last so high. While Wit attending You'll for ever see, Faithful amidst this vast Variety; Like Proteus, but affording Nobler Game, She ev'ry Shape assumes, and yet Remains the same. In short, none ever Wrote or will again So useful things in such a Heav'nly strain! When e'er I Hamlet or Othello read, My Hair starts up, and my Nerves shrink with dread! Pity and Terrour raise my Wonder high'r, 'Till betwixt both I'm ready to expire! When curs'd Iago cruelly I see Work up the Noble Moor to Jealousy, How cunningly the Villain weaves his Sin, And how the other takes the Poison in; Or when I hear his Godlike Romans rage, And by what just degrees He does Asswage Their Angry Mood, and by a Secret Art Return the mutual Union back to either Heart; When these and other such like Scenes I scan, 'Tis then, Great Soul, I think thee more than Man! Homer was Blind, yet cou'd all Nature see; THOU wert unlearn'd, yet knew as much as He! In Timon, Lear, the Tempest, we may find Vast Images of thy Unbounded Mind: These have been alter'd by our Poets now, And with Success, too, that we must allow: Third Days they get when Part of THEE is shown, Which they but Seldom do when All's their own. Nor shall Philaster, The Maids Tragedy, Thy King and no King, Fletcher, ever dye, But reach, with like Applause, to late Posterity. 'Tis true, they're Censur'd by a Modern Wit; But he shou'd not have blam'd, or not have Writ: For after all his Scandal on 'em thrown, 'Tis certain they're Superiour to his Own. We grant he has the Languages at Will; But some have Blessings, and they use 'em ill: The Usurer's Poor in spite of all his Pence, And so your Linguists may be lean of Sense. Let then this Maxim never be forgot, An Arrant Scholar is an Arrant Sot. Thee, Mighty Ben, we ever shall affect, Thee ever Mention with profound Respect, Thou most Judicious Poet! most Correct! I know not on what single Piece to fall, Sublimely Writ, and admirable all. Yet we must give Thee but thy just Desert; Y'ad less of Nature, tho' much more of Art: The Springs that move our Souls thou did'st not touch: But then thy Judgement, Care and Pains were such, We never yet did any Author see (Nor shall, perhaps, thro' all Futurity) That wrote so many Perfect Plays as Thee. Not one vain Humour thy strict view escapes, Or Folly, in their Thousand Various shapes: The Lines You drew did ev'ry Blemish hit, Your Dresses ev'ry Knave and Coxcomb fit; So vast the unbounded Ward-robe of Your WIT! Hail Sacred Bards! Hail ye Immortal Three! The British Muses Great Triumviri! Secure of Fame, You on the Stage will live Whilst we have Wits to hear, and they have Praise to give. 'Tis some where said our Courtiers speak more Wit In Conversation than these Poets Writ: Unjust Detraction! like it's Author, base; And it shall here stand Branded with Disgrace. Not but they had their Failings too;—but then They were such Faults as only spoke 'em Men; Errors which Human Frailty must admit, The Wanton Rovings of Luxurious Wit. To the Judicious plainly it appears, Their Slips were more the Ages Fault than theirs: Scarce had they ever struck upon the Shelves, If not oblig'd to stoop beneath themselves: Where Fletcher's loose, 'twas Writ to serve the Stage; And Shakespear play'd with Words to please a Quibbling Age. If Plays you love let these Your thoughts employ; When Wit is read by Wit 'twill never cloy, No other Poets so sublimely tell The useful, happy Art of Living Well: All strew'd with Morals, thick in ev'ry Page Alike Instructive both to Youth and Age. 'Tis certain on a Mistress and a Friend The chiefest Blessings of our Lives depend; And by their Draughts we may exactly find If that be Faithful, or if this be kind. There You may breath the Air of ev'ry Clime And make Remarks on Custom, Place and Time. Thro' ev'ry Stage of Life You there may View What Ills t'avoid, what Vertues to pursue; And so with Pleasure reap Advantage too. Unlike the Authors that have lately writ, Who in their Plays such Characters admit, So Lewd and Impious, they shou'd Punish'd be Almost as much as Oates for Perjury: With equal Scandal both supply the Age; He has disgrac'd the Gown, and they the Stage. Think, Ye vain Scribling Tribe, of Shirley's Fate, You that Write Farce, and You that Farce Translate; Shirley! the Scandal of the Ancient Stage, Shirley! the very Drf?y of his Age: Think how he lies in Duck-lane Shops forlorn, And never mention'd but with utmost Scorn. Think that the End of all your boasted Skill, As I presume to Prophesy it will, Justly—for many of You Write as ill. Change then Your Bias and Write Satyr all; Convert the little Wit You have to Gall. Care not to what a Bulk Your Labours swell; The Fame in which the Happy Few excell Lies not in Writing Much, but Writing Well. This Point obtain'd, attack the Impious Stage, Which You have made the Nusance of the Age; Nor fear but in th'Attempt Applause You'll get; Their Cause is Infamy, and ours is Wit. Lash the Lewd Actors—but first stop Your Nose The Stench is strong; and much wou'd discompose All but Your Selves—almost as bad as those. This Thought shou'd raise You to th'Extremest Pitch. Their Laughing at the Want that makes 'em Rich: Not more You Labour to increase their Store, Than they, Inhumanly, to keep You Poor; Making You dance Attendance, Cap in Hand, That once, like Spaniels, were at Your Command; Wou'd cringe and fawn, and who so kind as They? Exalted with the Promise of Your Play. But since A Famous Tragedian. Hart dy'd, and the two Houses join'd, What get ye? what Incouragment d'ye find? Yet still You Write, and Sacrifice your Ease, And for no other Gain—but what they please; Expell'd the House, unless you give 'em way To bilk You of Two Thirds in ev'ry Play. Let nothing then Your sense of Wrong asswage; The Muses Foes shou'd feel the Muses Rage: But then be just to Truth; for only that Is what th'Impartial Satyr levels at: Go not beyond; all base Aspersion shun; Let Justice and not Malice lead You on. To please, for once I'll give You an Essay, And in so good a Cause am proud to lead the Way. Prepare we then to go behind the Scenes, There to Survey the Copper Kings and Queens, Strutting in State, tho' Slaves by Nature meant, As they were truely those they Represent: But most the Women are Audacious seen, All Paint their Out-sides and all Pox within. Here 'tis our Quality are fond of such, Which ev'n their Wiser Footmen scorn to Touch: Divested of the Robes in which they're Cas'd, A Goat's as sweet, and Monkey's are as Chast. Not that they want, when they their Looks wou'd Arm, The Art to make, or keep their Cullies warm. With faint Denyals they inflame Desire, Till the hot Youth burns in his Am'rous Fire, Then wantonly into their Shifts retire: Spurr'd on by Lust the Dunce pursues the Dame, Careless of Health, and thoughtless of his Fame: Their Nightly She Majestically rules; Like Gallick Princes, all her Subjects, Fools.— But talking of their Shifts I mourn, my Friend, I mourn thy sudden, and disast'rous End: Here 'twas You did Resign Your Worthy Breath, And fell the Victim of a Cruel Death: The Shame, the Guilt, the Horror and Disgrace, Light on the Punk, the Murderer, and the Place. What Satyr can enough the Villains Sting That fight and stab for so abhor'd a Thing? A ten times cast off Drab, a Hackny Whore, Who when Sh'has ply'd the Stews and tir'd a Score, Insatiate as a Charnell, yawns for more. Her ev'ry Act in the Vene'real Wars Who e'er wou'd count, as well may count the Stars. So Insolent! there never was a Dowd So very basely born so very Proud: Yet Covetous; She'll Prostitute with any, Rather than wave the Getting of a Penny: For the whole Harvest of her Youthful Crimes Most frugally she hoards for Future Times, That then her Life may be with Lux'ury led, The hatter'd Carcase with Abundance fed; So damns the Soul to get the Body Bread. Yet in her Morals this is thought the best, And it is only Hell can Match the rest. An Actress now so fine a thing is thought, A Place at Court less eagerly is sought: As soon as in that Roll the Punks engross'd. Some Reverend Bawd does thus the Drab accost, Now is the Time You may Your Fortune raise, And meet at once with Pleasure, Wealth and Praise; 'Tis now, like Nell you may Immortal grow, Fam'd for Your Impudence, and Issue too; Posterity, if well You Play Your Part, Will call You Prudent, and Your Rise, Desert.— But the true Sense is this:—'Tis now your time (For only Vertu'ous Fools neglect their Prime) With open Blandishments and secret Art To glide into some Keeping Coxcomb's Heart, Who neither Sense or Manhood understands; And Jilt Him of his Patrimonial Lands: Others this Way have reach'd the top Extreams; Think of Ned Bush—then think of Mistress James: Some such like Cully to Your Share will fall; The Knight has nothing and the Punk has All: Twas by this Conduct B?y grew so Rich; Preferment You can't miss and be a B?. Th'Advice is took; and she hurries on, Fond to be kept, and in her Chariot shown; While Vulgar Drabs must meanly Trapes the Town. Against the Consequence she shuts her Eyes, For none at once were ever lewd and Wise: Thoughtless (like merry Andrew in his Pride) The higher Mounted we the more deride. In short the Stage (as Dorset-Court assures) Is but a Hot-Bed rais'd to force up Whores: Nor can the Soil so fast their Growth supply, As City, Camp and Country crowd to buy. How great a Beast is Man!—A Vertu'ous Dame, Unblemish'd in her Fortune and her Fame, They fly, as if she were the worst of Harms, And think a thrice Fluxt Actress has more Charms. Yet tho' so much they slight the Chast and Fair, No other Curses may they ever share, But only to Continue—what they Are. Now for the Men; whom we alike shall find As Loose, as Vile, and Brutal in their Kind: Here one who lately, as an Author notes, Hawk'd thro' the Town, and cry'd Gazettes and Votes, Is grown a Man of such Accomplish'd Parts, He thinks all Praise beneath his just Deserts: Rich as a Jew, yet tho' so wealthy known, He rasps the Under-Actors to the Bone. Not Lewis more Tyrannically Rules, Than He among this Herd of Knaves and Fools. Among his other Vertues, ne'er was Elf So very much Enamor'd of Himself; But let Him if he pleases think the best Upon that Head; and we'll Supply the rest. What if some Scribblers to his Sense submit? He is not therefore only Judge of Wit: Approving such, betrays a Vitious Tast: For few can tell what will for ever last, If all cou'd Judge of Wit that think they can, The Vilest Ass wou'd be the Wittiest Man. In Company, with either Youth or Age, H'has all the Gum and Stiffness of the Stage: Dotard! and thinks his haughty Movements there, A Rule for his Behaviour ev'ry where. To this we'll add his Lucre, Lust and Pride, And Knav'ry, which in vain He strives to hide, For thro' the thin Disguise the Canker'd Heart is spy'd. 'Tis true, his Action Merits just Applause; But lies the Fame most in th'Effect or Cause? If from good Iustruments fine Musick springs, The Credit's chiefly his that tun'd the Strings: Thus, tho' they Speak, they speak Another's Thought; As Monkey's Grin, and Parrots learn by Rote. Another You may see, a Comick Spark, That wou'd be Lacy, but ne'r hits the Mark, Not but his Making Sport must be confess'd, For where the Author fails, he is Himself the Jest. To be well laught at is his whole Delight, And there, indeed, we do the Coxcomb Right. Tho' the Comedian makes the Audience roar, When off the Stage, the Booby tickles more: When such are born some easy Planet rules, And Nature, dozing, makes a Run of Fools. A Third, a punning, drolling, bant'ring Ass, Cocks up, and fain wou'd for an Author pass. His Face for Farce Nature at first design'd, And match it, too, with as Burlesque a Mind: Made him, as vilely born, so careless bred, And gave Him Heels of Cork, but Brains of Lead. To speak 'em all were tedious to discuss; But if You'll Lump 'em, they're exactly thus: A Pimping, Spunging, Idle, Impious Race, The Shame of Vertue, and Despair of Grace: A Nest of Leachers worse than Sodom bore, And justly Merit to be Punish'd more, Diseas'd, in Debt, and ev'ry Moment dun'd; By all Good Christians loath'd, and their own Kindred shun'd. To say more of 'em wou'd be wasting Time; For it with Justice may be thought a Crime To let such Rubbish have a Place in Rhime. Now hear a Wonder and 'twill well declare How resolutely lewd some Women are; For while these Men we thus severely use, Our Ladies differ hugely from the Muse; Supply their wants, and raise 'em from Distress, Advanc'd ev'n for their very Wickedness. Goodman himself, an Infidel profess'd, With Plays reads Cl?d nightly to her Rest: Nay in Her Coach she whirls Him up and down, And Publishes her Passion to the Town, As if 'twere her Delight to make it known: And known it shall be, in my Pointed Rhimes Stand Infamous to all succeeding Times. 'Twere Endless Work, describing ev'ry Vice That from the Play-house takes Immediate Rise, The Devil has on Earth no Magazin That opens to us such an Impious Scene, Or where, for Store, he lays more Lewdness in. Not in the Inns of Court we hardly see, At once, a Vaster Reach of Villany; Tho' with the Lawyer the Belief does reign— No Hell but Poverty, nor God but Gain. Here Murder, Lust and Blasphemy are found, And all the Crimes with which the Times abound, To wheel in Circles an Eternal Round. As the New-River does from Islington, Thro' several Pipes, serve half the Spacious Town, So the Luxurious Lewdness of the Stage, Drain'd off, feeds half the Brothels of the Age. In short (nor will it bear the least Debate) Unless these Vices we cou'd Regulate, The Play-house is the Scandal of the State. But here it was (with drowsy Fumes oppress'd) I dropt my Pen, and nodded into Rest; When Fancy, willing to Improve my Spleen, Set in my View this Visionary Scene. The Third Part. On a Sweet Verdant Plain methought I stood, Just by a Hill crown'd with a Spacious Wood: One lonely Path (which now I'd enter'd in) Led from the Lawn up thro' the Silvan Scene. On Pleas'd I went directly to the Grove, The Silent kind Retreat of Rural Love. The Rising Sun had now its Entrance made Ten thousand ways, and Chequer'd all the Shade. Thick lay the Dew, and, just like Diamonds Bright, Sent thro' the leafy Arch reflected Light; High on the Boughs were pearch'd the Feather'd Choir, Their more Ambitious Notes ascending higher: Each Emulating each, and plac'd apart, Try'd all the sweet Contentions of their Art: Now I observ'd the Tuneful Challenge here Then how in Heav'nly Strains 'twas Answer'd there; Neither the best, yet both above Compare. Mean while, as with Design, a Balmy Breeze, Rising and falling Gently by degrees, Fann'd all the Sweets of Flora thro' the Trees. Nothing there wanted but the Fruit of Gold To vye with the Hesperian Grove of old. Ah! Heav'n, I cry'd, what Happiness there dwells In Humble Huts and unfrequented Cells! In some low Cottage by this Copses side, How safely does the Country Swain reside! How undisturb'd when down to Rest he lies! How Joyful when the Glorious Sun does rise! This Musick in his Ears, this Scene before his Eyes! Ah! might I once so blest a Fortune know, How Gladly I'd the Chase of Fame forgo? No more I wou'd the Stingy Great rehearse, And sing their Names in Panegyrick Verse: No more I wou'd attempt the Tragick Strain, When (after all th'Expence of Time and Pain) One Female Player's Breath makes all my Labours vain. With Contemplations such as these I pass'd Thro' the Steep Glade, and reach'd the Top at last; Then, looking down, beheld below a Scene Of Booths and People stragg'ling on the Green; A various Mixture of each Sex intent I drinking saw, and wonder'd what it meant. Advancing nearer, soon the Cause appear'd That drew together the Promiscuous Herd; 'Twas Water, Dullwych Waters, which they quaff'd As Porters do their Belch—a Pint a Draught: Till gorg'd at length, in Squadrons they withdraw T'emit their Grief,—nor Decency a Law: So thick they under ev'ry Bush appear, You'd verily believe the Town was clear, And all it's filthy Rabble Purging here. Such Min'eral Fountains other Bards may sing; To me they're all beneath a Common Spring. If Instinct never for the worse does chuse, Why shou'd we drink what Birds and Beasts refuse? With Crudities th'Internal Parts they fill, And the bleak Poison thro' the Blood instill, Weaken the Sick, and make the Healthy Ill; For, after all, we must new Methods find To purge away the Dreggs they leave behind. The Doctors say, indeed they'll wonders do;— But Mountebanks commend their Ratsbane too. In short the Waters to Physicians are The same as Rogue-Attorneys to the Bar; These work for Law, and those for Physick raise, And so will do to all Succeeding Days, While there the Client, here the Patient Pays. But grant the Doctor all he'd have, and more; Why must those Suit the Rich and these the Poor, When Nature, in the Structure of our Frame, Has of one Flesh made all Mankind the same? The Cits are bid to Epsom to Resort, And Tunbridge is Prescrib'd for those at Court; While Dullwych only serves for those Degrees That cannot rise to be Destroy'd for Fees: For grosser Allum, being less Genteel, Must not pretend to vye with those of Steel: To ease the Rich, thus, Urine is the Rule, And Poverty must be Reliev'd by Stool. O Dotage! which no Age but ours cou'd be So fond of, as distinctly not to see; For whatsoe'er the Water-Mongers think The Vertues are of this their Mine'ral Drink, If heedfully the true Effects they'd mind Of being at the Wells, they'd quickly find The Ease they feel, and all the Health they share, Is only due (while they continue there) To Temperance, Exercise, and Country Air. Turning my Head, and eager to be gone, Who shou'd I see methought, but Hains alone? And all alone poor Joseph well might be Who, (bating those of his Fraternity,) Cou'd not on Earth find Company to suit A Name so Vile, and Life so Dissolute. I date thee Fool, cry'd I, this very Hour, Of all Mankind what need hast thou to Scow'r? Nor Sup't last Night, nor broke thy Fast to Day What is there in thee left to Purge away? But why on Sunday Morning dost thou come? The Day that all thy Brethren stay at home. Cou'd on thy Friendly care not one Prevail To fetch him Physick, and to warm him Ale? The Church they leave to those it more does please, Their Souls of less concern than their Disease. In short, what all the Week they Whore and Swill, They Rectify to Day with Peter's Pill. Faith 'tis a just Remark, quoth Honest Joe; A Jest has 'twice the odds for being true. But if you will your Luggs this way incline, I'll let You know this Morning's whole Design. Our Converse with our selves, I freely own, To be, perhaps, the worst the World has known; The Themes we Relish with the truest Gust Is Guile, Aspersion, Blasphemy and Lust: If such a thing on Earth as Hell there be, The Stage is Tophet—and it's Fiends are we. First then, in Truth, I hither did Repair To Bleach my Brimstone off in wholsome Air. Next I'd some Gallery Tickets to dispose, And in this Place I ne'er my Labour lose: Here fifeeen Pence I've always down and down, For what wou'd yield me but a Hog in Town. And last in my Return I seldom fail To get my Swill of Dullwych College Ale. These little Shifts, grown useless for the Stage, I'm forc'd to follow to sustain my Age. Our Sharers, now so insolent are they, We Under-Actors must like Slaves obey; And toil and drudge, while they divide the Pay. Not Busby more Tyrannically Rules, Than Bet?n among his Knaves and Fools: But most to me is his ill Nature shown, Because my Voice is with my Palate gone: Not that I faster than the rest decline; Both Men and Women in my Failing joyn, And B?y's Breath is grown as rank as mine. Uneasy with my Company, I here Wou'd have took leave, and gave a Civil Leer. No hold, quoth Joe, my Tickets all are gone, And if you please, Ill wait on you to Town: Or if you'll take a Sermon by the Way, (For at the College 'tis their Preaching Day) I shall be much Oblig'd by such a Stay. With all my Heart, cry'd I; I'm glad your Mind Has took that Bent;—and keep it so inclin'd: You'll find more Comfort in one Hour of Pray'r Than all the Clappings of the Theatre, Tho' you should yet enjoy 'em Twenty Year. So on I pass'd, now first, and now behind, Still giving him the Lee-ward of the Wind; Avoiding so the Breathings of his Ghest, Which he so frankly own'd were not the best. At last, quoth Joe, you by and by shall see The Gift of one of our Society: Nor Greece nor Rome it's Equal ever show'd, So Nobly is it built, so Lib'rally endow'd. The Poet may Instruct and Please the Sense, And worthy Schemes may be deduc'd from thence, But 'tis a Barren Good that costs him no Expence: Our Allen did a nobler Pattern set, But not one Bard has imitated yet. His Name, said I, we to the Clouds shou'd raise The least it merits's Everlasting Praise: But most unjustly on the Bards you fall: Rich tho' he was, from them he rais'd it all. Not to disgrace his Vertue, or his Wit, What had he got, had Shakespear never writ? As to our selves, had we the Players Gains, (And more our Right it is, as more our Pains) We had exceeded all that he has done, And gave the World an Instance,—more than one: Not, but 'tis Nobler yet, to form the Mind To Vertue,—and to keep it so inclin'd, (The Work for which we solely were design'd) Than 'tis the Loftiest Edifice to build, Or to Endow;—and Nobler Fruit 'twill yield. His Charity, which justly we extol, Does but Respect the Body;—Ours the Soul: Twit us not then that we no Fabricks raise, When from a better Claim we hold our Praise; Nor think the Bard that does Exhaust his Sense, At least that culls the richest Precepts thence, To teach Mankind, can write without Expence: Cou'd we our Purses wide as Allen strain, 'Tis nobler yet to spend upon the Brain. In Contemplation rapt above the Skies, We look on Yellow Dirt with heedless Eyes: What truly Christian Bard would Gold adore, When he may teach Contentment to the Poor. And shew the World the Rich have no Excuse That put not Money to its Genuine Use? Like Him w'ave mention'd, who employ'd his Store To breed up Friendless Youth and feed the Aged Poor. But least of all you on the Muse shou'd throw Your Scurril Jests, that keep her Sons so low: How can our Suffering Tribe but chuse to be The Sons of Hardship and Necessity? When, let our Plays be acted half an Age, W'ave but a third Days Gleaning of the Stage? The rest is yours:—and hence your Sharers rise, And once above us, all our Aid despise: Hence has your Osmin drawn his Wealthy Lot, And hence has Zara all her Thousands got: Zara! that Proud, Opprobrious, Shameless Jilt, Who like a Devil justifies her Guilt, And feels no least Remorse for all the Blood sh'has spilt But prithee Joe, since so she boasts her Blood, And few have yet her Lineage understood, Tell me, in short, the Harlot's true Descent, 'Twill be a Favour that you shan't repent. Truly said Joe, as now the Matter goes, What I shall speak must be beneath the Rose. Her Mother was a common Strumpet known, Her Father half the Rabble of the Town. Begot by Casual and Promiscuous Lust, She still retains the same Promiscuous Gust. For Birth, into a Suburb Cellar hurl'd, The Strumpet came up Stairs into the World. At Twelve she'd freely in Coition join, And far surpass'd the Honours of her Line. As her Conception was a Complication, So its Produce, alike, did serve the Nation; Till by a Black, Successive Course of Ills, She reach'd the Noble Post which now she fills; Where, Messalina like, she treads the Stage, And all Enjoys, but nothing can Asswage! Thus towards the College we went jogging on: Arriv'd, we found the Service just begun:— Step in quoth Joe;—I'll come to you anon: The Cook and Butler I must visit first; For Hunger one, and t'other for my Thirst. Let not your Corps, said I, be yet your Care; Your better Part shou'd first be treated here: If lasting Ease you'd to the Body find, Let there be nothing wanting to the Mind. My Paunch, said he, knows not what Doctrine means;— You take the Stage;—I'll go behind the Scenes. Sighing I enter'd;—when a kind Surprise: Did entertain at once my Ears and Eyes: The Organs Solemn Musick sounding there, The Singing Boys Responding Voices here, The Master and the Wardens grave Deport, The Strict Devoutness of the meaner Sort, The Management of all did soon inspire My Soul with Joy! when joining with the Quire, In Pray'r and Praises I perform'd my Part; Nor less, I hope, my Ardor at the Heart. But now the Service and the Sermon done, (Whilst I to render Thanks was kneeling down) Methought they of a sudden all were gone: Surpris'd at the Event, I gaz'd about; Saw none within, nor saw no Passage out. 'Tis well, said I,—and blest! O blest be they, That in this Sacred Court delight to stay! O Time! how smoothly then thou glid'st away! When nothing Anxious in the Soul is found, But Faith and Practice take their Equal Round; When ev'ry Word a Pious Rapture fires, And makes it self a Heav'n, while it to Heav'n aspires! Thus walking up and down, to thought Resign'd, At last the founder came into my Mind; Nor cou'd I my Conceptions then contain, (Tho' something for the Sacred Place too vain,) But broke out loud in this Extatick Strain. O happy! happy and Instructive Age When Shakespear Writ, and Allen trod the Stage! To Emulation fir'd, 'twas hard to tell Which of the famous two did most Excel. But O thou Darling Poet of our Isle, And thou th'Erecter of this Sacred Pile, How wou'd you Blush were you but now to see, Both Plays and Players black Impiety! And wish y'ad never rais'd the Infant Stage, Since grown so black and Sinful in her Age: With Vice she wou'd Instruct, with Vice Delight; And all she does Pervert, that hear, that Act, that Write. 'Twas here, methought, an Awful Form appear'd In a long Gown, and Venerable Beard. And who art Thou, he cry'd, that thus dost Praise The Bards and Actors of the former Days? And what are now their Follies and their Crimes, With which they so infest the Present Times? I am, said I, Apollo's meanest Son, Who yet the Vices of his Greatest shun; One, that with other Bards this Good design, Plays to reform and make the Stage Divine: No Vitious Plots we'd on the Age obtrude, On Morals built, they shou'd be so pursu'd: To Truth and Sense the Audience we'd Conduct, And first we'd Please, that we might next Instruct; That Centre where the Drama still shou'd tend, As first 'twas purpos'd for no other End. But w'are oppos'd by such an impious Train Of Players, as make all our Studies vain; Nothing they'll Act, and nothing they esteem That does not Vertue shame, and God Blaspheme. Instead of such as did this Fabrick build, The Stage does now a Set of Monsters yield; So openly Debauch'd, So flaming Ill, As scarce, perhaps, are to be match'd in Hell! Nor does this Censure only touch the Young, But does alike to those of Years belong; Who, rich as Jews, no other Pious Use Make of their Wealth, but Vertue to Seduce: Not Allen more did on this Pile bestow Than they on Strumpets, or to make 'em so; Witness Mill-Bank, where Osmin keeps his Trulls With what, by sharing, he exacts from Fools. THE Corruption of the TIMES BY MONEY. A SATYR. TO Fleetwood Sheppard Esq; Gentleman-Usher daily Waiter to the KING, &amp;c. 'Twas not the dazling Gem, or shining Ore, The Pride of Courts, nor Pluto's endless Store, That in mild Saturn's peaceful Reign, of old, Did constitute the famous Age of Gold; 'Twas Innocence alone, the greatest Good That cou'd on human Nature be bestow'd: Under his Vine each Man securely lay, And, Wealth unknown, ne'er practis'd to betray. The Daughter's Dowry was untainted Youth, Attended by Virginity and Truth; Who now can one with such a Fortune find? O charming—but O faithless Womankind! Why are not Heav'n's best Blessings made to last? Ah! Why so brittle? Why so quickly past? Why did those Golden Minutes fly so fast? Upright the Image of his God was made, But Ah! How is he warp'd? How is he stray'd? His own Inventions, wildly, he pursues, Can gain but little, and has much to lose: Ev'n Earth's dark Bowels from his piercing sight Cou'd not conceal her Seeds of glittering Light! He digs, succeeds, his shining Labour fines, And streight has new Desires and new Designs: Swell'd with his Wealth, disclaims his kindred Earth, And talks of Titles, Dignities, and Birth. With Use of Money use of Fraud began, And then 'twas, first, that Man did ruin Man. A while, indeed, the happy Spartan State, With a firm Mind, did all her Charms rebate, And so long stood as if 'twere prop'd by Fate: Success her Standard ever did attend, And Fame declares her Praise shall never end: But Gold and Silver seiz'd the Reins at length, Those Delilahs betray'd her of her Strength, Unstrung her Nerves and usher'd in her Bane, Which half the World, before, had strove to do in vain. To name the Guilt, the Cruelty, and Rage This Mischief has produc'd in every Age Is not the Task which here the Muse enjoyns; We only speak the Follies and the Crimes With which it does infest the Present Times: Bold the Design, but points at publick good, And that will have the publick Thanks,—or shou'd. Take, then, a view of all that you can see, Of each Religion, Calling, and Degree; The Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, Papists, Socinians, and their elder Brethren Atheists; Lords, Laqueys, Juglers, Judges, Knaves and Fools, Punks, Players, Pimps and Bawds, with all the Shoals Of Trading Cuckolds that encompass Pauls; Mark to what Centre all their Motions tend, And see if Money's not their only End, Their Primum Mobile that makes no Stay, But wheels about and turns 'em all one Way. The dutious Knee-Observance paid by Heirs, The Bully's Curses and the Beggars Prayers, The Lover's Courtship and the Cant of Schism, The Strumpet's Patience under Priapism, The Statesman's Love he to his Country bears, The perjur'd Villains Lavishness of Ears, The Noise of Billingsgate, the Eloquence Of Lawyers, which they Copy out from thence, Only the Jargon's more and less the Sense; The Whitehall fawning Office to obtain (While good Men dance Attendance there in vain;) A Flutt'ring Coxcomb, or a Pliant Knave Has still, in Court, th'Advantage of the Brave, For he that's Honest will not be a Slave: The base Submissions to Insult we show, (For Man, by Nature, cannot stoop so low) The Slavish Distance we to Favourites pay, (For Knaves in Office turn Promotions Key) Priests cringing to Superior Mitr'd-Pride, Supple to them, but stiff to all beside; The Love and Friendship to the Rich we feign, And e'en the Poets Panegyrick Strain, Is nothing else but the pursuit of Gain. 'Tis true, most of them (which would force a Smile) Hunt on cold Scent, pursue a Fruitless Toyl. The Punning Coxcomb may pretend to get, But—(if I too may Pun) 'tis more in Debt. The Laquey may grow Rich while Lords come short, Of which we've Store of Instances at Court, The Jugler and the Judge, too, may complain, For both now strive to Cheat the World in vain; In Slight and Shift and Trick they both agree, But a quick Eye may all their Hocus see: This difference, tho', we may between 'em write, That by Profession, does deceive your Sight, This does you Wrong and sits to do you Right: How many for a trifling Theft have dy'd? While Murd'rers live and Flourish by a Bribe. Why (O ye Pow'rs) must the sad Hemp and Hymn Belong to Common Rogues and only them? And the curs'd Judge, that has an Itching Palm, Dye Old, without his Halter and a Psalm? The Soldiers, too, may cease of War to prate, For Cutting Throats may once grow out of Date, And then we starve the Male-Contents of State; Those Needy Villains that still pray for Change, To satisfie their Wants and their Revenge. The Scismatick may Cant but be deceiv'd, For Knaves and Fools may cease to be believ'd: What Holiness so e'er the Fops may feign, Their Audience finds their Godliness is Gain: Large Contributions made 'em leave the Church, And now grown small, have left them in the lurch. Their Resty Flocks will serve God in no way Th'Indulgence of the State allows they may: A true-blue Sect'ress, like a Weed that's crop'd, Will thrust Ten Branches out for One that's lop'd, But let alone, like that, he grows so fast, He is by his own Rankness kill'd at last: Whoever, then, intends their Extirpation, Will do it easiest by a Toleration. The Harlot's Pleasure too may turn to pain, One cruel Flux licks up a Twelve-months Gain; But Flux on Flux makes not her lewdness less, Nor the vain Fop less eager to possess; Till pox'd all o'er, embracing one another, They but change Hells at last, from that to 'tother. The Friendship of the Rich we may implore, And shall attain it—if we are not Poor: They Feast, invite, and Pamper one another, But spare not one Thought on a Starving-Brother: Yet some will give, but 'tis to get Applause, Or Patch up many avaricious Flaws; A Specious Veil they draw, but who's not blind May see the sneaking, grudging Churl behind. Can a few Pence you give the Crime atone Of scraping Pounds together, not your Own? Some of it glean'd from the Day-Labourers Hire, And some retrench'd from Servants Food and Fire. Or if I throw a Shilling to the Poor, Relieves it him I wrong'd of Ten before? Mistaken Men! so did that Limner paint, That made a Devil and design'd a Saint. The Poet, too, a Parasite may be But thro' his fulsom Praise all Eyes may see His Little Truth and large Necessity: If he cringe much the less will be his Lot; A Hangman's Hire is not so Basely got. Why shou'd a Wit (against Apollo's Rules) Take Pay for giving Fame to Knaves and Fools? Why shou'd that Art to Prostitution fall? Inspir'd by Heav'n, yet at a Coxcomb's Call. O fix not him a Pattern for the Times That's Eminent for nothing but his Crimes! But let that Patron only fill your Lays That does Reward your Toyl, not Buy your Praise: Such Sidney was, and such is Dorset now, With Wreaths of everlasting Praise adorn his gen'rous Brow. But Pander, Player, Pimp and Bawd will thrive As long as Farce, or Theatre survive, For Lust and Vanity o'erflow the Age, And still ebb back to their own Spring, the Stage; But leave, at every Tyde, more Vice behind Than there wou'd need to taint all Human-kind: So Nile, decreasing, spreads a slime so Rich, Serpents take Life from the Suns Vital Itch, Less monstrous Births than Play-house Dog and Bitch. Thus, tho' th'extreamest Shift and Craft is try'd, The most that Toyl for Gain shoot short, or wide; Unluckily at the bright Mark they aim, Which tho' they miss, they must not miss the blame, For their undue pursuit is still the same. Destructive Mineral! when God curs'd the Earth Was the sad Minute that did give thee Birth; From Hell thou com'st, and thither must again Retire, when done thy Universal Reign: Nor does this with the Ancients disagree! When to each thing th'assign'd a Deity, He that was God of Hell was God of thee. Talk not of Nations rul'd by Cæsar's Line, The greatest Monarchy on Earth is thine: With Faith thou may'st Futurity contend, For Thine's a Kingdom that will never end. What more than happy Minutes might we see? How Virtuous? How like Angels might we be (Thou thrice accursed Mineral!) but for thee? While we are Infants we but with thee play, Nor care to keep, but rather throw away: Ah! Why (or do we older grow in vain?) Don't we in Age that Quality retain? Why shou'd our first Five Years be wiser far Than all our following, riper Moments are? Much are we tempted by the Female Face, A Thousand ways they bring us to Disgrace, But Gold's the great Debaucher of our Race, Lovers and Fools, perhaps wou'd come by kind, But among Men one Villain you'd not find That Tempter silent, our quick-hoisted Sail Is always spread to take the smiling Gale; Not once considering there in that may be More Rocks and Shelves and Sands than in the Sea. Gold to Death's Palace leads the steepy Way, Once in the Path we have no Power to stay; It blinds our Eyes, nor one safe Step assures, And has a Key to all his Thousand Doors. When shou'd we hear of Treachery in War But for thee, thee, thou greater Mischief far? What Countries has the Gallick Monarch's Gold Poorly and basely, falsely, bought and Sold? No Persons for his Countries Friends are known But Spotted Traytors that would sell their own: True Glory he, yet never had in Chase, But owes his Honours (what can be more base?) Ev'n to the Refuse of all Human Race. Why shou'd we talk so hard of Machiavel (As if he'ad equal'd the Prime Fiend of Hell) And pass by Mazarin and Richlieu's Name, No less than him deserving endless blame? Justice, Injustice were by turns carest, Just as they serv'd their Tyrants Interest? Tho the blest Pledge of Publick Faith had past, The League, if not Convenient, must not last: Not done i'th' dark, the World proclaim'd the shame! And taught from hence (their freedom who can blame?) Ev'n Infidels reproach the Blessed Name: Distrust a Turk, he'll this reply afford; Am I a Christian Dog to break my Word? These two Achitophels are justly curst, And shou'd have had the Fate, too, of the first, Their Politicks does still his Councils Rule, To these two fatal Names he went to School. And such successful, wicked Progress made, He does trandscend the Teachers in their Trade. His treach'rous Gold he deals by Sea, by Land, Bribery's the Base on which his Fame does Stand, Take that away he falls, while every Eye Sees 'twas not Courage made him soar so high! That no true Conduct the Crown'd Atheist rear'd, But his Suborning of the Foes he fear'd. Flagitious Villains! that for Foreign Pay Their King, their Country and their Friends betray! Villains! whom Mercy's Self wou'd blush to save, Or, tho' 'twere under Tyburn, grant a Grave, For whom all Curses past and all to come Here and in Hell it self's too mild a Doom! Yet they shall boast their Birth and high Descent, Which is, if possible, more Impudent: 'Tis true, we own, as to their Station here, Some of 'em move in an Illustrious Sphere; (Illustrious, if they wou'd continue there:) But as no Man is Base-born that is Good, So Peers may be Plebeians understood, For Virtue 'twas that first distinguish'd Blood; He that betrays his Country, tho' the first In Pow'r, is, in degree of Vice the worst If he, then, that's most Vicious is most Base, Why shou'd a Villain talk of Noble Race? If by brave Deeds our Fathers got a Name, Have we by Ill the same Pretence to Fame? Ah! no—their Glory, but decrys our Shame. These are the Tools the Tyrant does seduce, No Devil half so proper for his Use. So Philip, when he with the Græcians strove, Did by the same Machine his Actions move; Cities he sack'd, and did much more perform By that, than his whole Army could by Storm. But Infamous his Memory is compar'd With his great Son, who made his Sword his Guard, In Person fought, the conquer'd East o'er ran; Tho' not Heav'n-born, if Blood by Blood we scan, Not Philip, Sire, but some more God-like Man: Of his reputed Father's Acts asham'd, Begot that Saying, yet so justly fam'd; (To which his Life so clearly did agree,) Advis'd, by Night, to fight the Enemy, He cry'd—He wou'd not steal a Victory: Tho' then he for the Mightiest Empire fought, So, as he greatly spoke, 'twas bravely sought. Gold he despis'd, or us'd as Glory bid, And made it the Reward of those that did Great things; the Man of Merit lay not hid. So in the Age to come, when William's Name And haughty Lewis are declar'd by Fame, The first shall stand with such Illustrious Braves We nam'd before, the last with Treacherous Slaves; Whom here the Muse the rather does impeach, To show no Crime's beyond a Satyr's reach. Yet, tho' he bribes, so high, it owe its rise To that low sordid Crime of Avarice; For if he part with a Substantial Sum, 'Tis but a Penny gone for Pounds to come. Well may to Covet (as Prescription Sings) Be the curst Root from whence all Evil Springs, When that Plebeian Vice can rise to Kings. But these, curst Mineral, are not half the ills That down from Thee on Wretched man distills; Thou art not only cause of Publick bane, But dost in Private hold as loose a Rein: All Dealing is thy own; cheat that cheat can, Is thy great Maxim between Man and Man. Some are thy Sworn, and some thy daily Slaves; Women and Thee make all Men Fools and Knaves. Man is so pliant to thy forming Hand, He runs into all Moulds at thy Command, Takes all Impressions, and is prov'd by Thee, The constant Drudge of Inconsistency. 'Tis thou that dost this Proteus unbind From what h'has Sworn, and what he has design'd, And mak'st him vary Colour, Shape and Mind; Now in Trunk-Breeches, next in Pantaloons, Now prays with Priests, then Curses with Dragoons, In the same Breath tis bless us, and 'tis Zo?ns Influenc'd by Thee, we trust not one another, Or if we do, w'are cheated by a Brother. Neighbour on Neighbour thou like Dogs dost set, And mak'st 'em faster keep the Hold they get: We first grieve at another's Happiness, And the next Step we strive to make it less, Or what he has, wou'd wrongfully possess. Envy from thee draws out her sharpest Stings, By thee encourag'd, she her Arrow flings Alike, Promiscuously, at Slaves and Kings; The very Altar can't secure the Hand On which she'll fix her Stigmatizing Brand; Traduces them, does their just Income grutch, Prays they may starve; to her (her Nature's such) To God that gave all, one in Ten's too much: Not but 'tis wish'd those Tenths were better us'd, More duly paid, and, taken, less abus'd. 'Tis thou that dost the Fashion-Monger guide, And art the sweetest Nourishment of Pride; 'Tis thou dost spread her like a Peacock's Tail, And breath the Blast that fills the gawdy Sail: In Women thou dost, chiefly, make her Reign, And Female Fops, if possible, more vain. Head-Tires like Turbants, now, our Ladies wear, False Hearts, false Shapes, false Honour and false Hair: Against th'old Woman's Steeple-Hat they cry, Yet, with slight Gauses, dress three times as high: The good Wives Cover was not made in vain, The Other's hous'd with the first drop of Rain: Close to her Tail th'Obsequious Coxcomb goes, And licks his Lips with pleasing of his Nose: Where-e're she comes, so loose a Train she brings, Tho' Men by Name, you'd swear they're other things: Just so attended the proud Bitch does pass The Streets, Tray, Ring-wood, Jowler at her A? The Changes of their Minds we may admire, But can they vary more than their Attire? You'll say this is false Doctrine I maintain, Women may plead Prescription to be vain: To clear their Guilt, that Plea will never do, For then all Fops might plead Prescription too. But you, perhaps, are brib'd to take their Part, And cry, no Pride's a Sin, but Pride of Heart; And therefore since no Opticks can pretend Into those deep Recesses to descend, We know not who is Proud—you err again, No other Crime can be descry'd so plain: Who does not see Pride in our Nature lies, When what we ought to Honour we despise? The Parents that did press us to the Breast Must not appear, if they are meanly drest, Or if they do, their Visits must be brief, As if they lost their Senses with their Teeth. Some drive 'em from their Doors (unnatural Race!) And wonder they'll come there to their Disgrace. 'Tis true, this only is of Upstarts said, The better Sort, you'll say, are better bred; But mark if in their Conduct you can find One Thought that's to Humility inclin'd: Their nearest Kin, reduc'd to Poverty, They loath to hear of, and they blush to see. Observe the Fop that is just come to Age, (His Mother dead that brought the Heritage:) See in a Storm, when he does Couch the Streets, And his old Father overtakes, or meets, Dropping all o'er and soak'd thro' to the Skin, Mark if the Villain stops to take him in. In short, Men of Estate and Noble Blood, By consequence, are rather Proud than Good: Pride's Fountain-Head we may from Money bring As nat'rally as Water from the Spring; Whether 'tis in the Heart, or in the Dress, More Money makes it more, but never less: But when this Vice does on poor Gentry fall, 'Tis then the most Ridiculous of all; For he tha'ts Thread-bare, and that's bare of Pence, If to Nobility he makes Pretence, We may conclude to be as bare of Sense. With Pride thou giv'st Birth to her grinning Train, To all that is affected, all that's Vain; For Vanity (which one whole Sex devours) Stands waiting at her Elbow at all Hours, Just as, they say, the Devil does at Ours; And Affectation takes her very Trace, When one appears, the Other's still in Place: So the Bawd waits at the great State's-Man's Doors, And so attended with her Brace of Whores: For the vain Nymph, and the affected Dame, If not so yet, will quickly be the same. In Coach and Chair they whirl it up and down, No Common Hackney-Strumpet's better known, Not Hatton's Steel-chin'd Drab that tir'd the Town, And did more Surgeons in a year enrich, Than all the rest—the Ne plus ultra Bitch! These Creatures are for ever on the Range; The Play-House, Park, Spring-Garden, Court, Exchange, Their daily Round, where, tho' whole years they run, They tire no more than when they first begun; Rather push faster onwards in the Race, As falling Stones, cou'd we suppose a Space So deep, wou'd near the Centre mend their Pace: Chatt'ring, Dancing, Singing, each her Part Runs wildly o'er, without Wit, Heed, or Art; And if a Coxcomb, Pert, and Vain, and Dull, Does joyn their Train, he makes the Concert full: Not Guzling, Gossips at a Christ'ning Feast, When Mother Mid-night drops a Bawdy Jest, (Of all the Women, still the greatest Beast) Can make that Unintelligible Din As these abound with when their Hands are in. In Dress, in Language, Converse, Shape and Mein Are Vanity and Affectation seen: Nothing so hard, of all ill things, to hide As these Appendixes and Rags of Pride. Yet, who can think their selves so free from Guilt, As the vain Coxcomb and affected Jilt? In vain we wou'd convert 'em with our Rage, They're best convinc'd by Beggary and Age, Both be their Lot, for who wou'd Pity have On a fine foolish Drab, or Selfish Slave? False glaring Fires! But rais'd (O Gold!) from thine, Thy Brightness makes these Exhalations shine. Ev'n Contradictions take from thee their Rise, As Prodigality and Avarice; Nor dost thou only but in Them agree, Thou art the Sire of Sloath and Industry: Not of that Industry, by which the Swain, With Sweat and Toil, does earn an honest Gain; (O Industry! thou Child of true Content, Who'd not be Needy to be Innocent?) But that which makes the Merchant cross the Main, The Lawyer any Villain's Cause maintain, Those Indefatigable Slaves of Gain: Who wou'd not be the Labourer, nam'd before, Than these with an Ill Conscience, and their Store? But as the Man that's Civil ne'er will hit The lucky Vein that constitutes a Wit; So he that's Honest, cannot Wealthy grow By the bare Method of Continuing so: Whatever then, the thriving Churl may say, All great Estates are got another way. O Honesty! thou lasting Peace of Mind, Thou Radiant Jewel which but few will find! All over bright thou liest to charm the Eye, But (wretched Men!) we wink and pass thee by. Give me but that, ye Pow'rs, I ask no more, To Muck-Worms leave the Riches they adore: No surer Guard I'll e'er desire to keep Me safe, nor softer Opium for my Sleep: Serene my Hours, like them my Conscience free, Which no rich prosp'rous Villain e'er can be, No griping, scraping, hard, assiduous Slave, No wealthy Fool, or over-reaching Knave, Tho' he is lighted by the Sun of Pleasure, And can lie Basking on his Banks of Treasure. But, as this faulty Industry takes Growth From thee, no less doth Laziness and Sloath: If by our Servants Labour we can shun The thought of Care, we hold our Work is done; Not thinking, while we doze away our Hours, The more their Business, so, the more is Ours; Their Labour does our Laziness reproach, Our Laziness their Labour does debauch. Who'd think, at twelve a Clock it shou'd be said That the great Lady's soaking in her Bed? When, to repair the sensible Decay That ten hours hearty Sleep has took away, Dish after Dish, for Chocolate she calls; (She must be often rais'd that often falls.) That strong-back'd Liquor hoops 'em in the Chine, No other Nectar they allow Divine. Vain Sex! at once both Foolish and Unjust, To think they need Provocatives to Lust; Were all their Lives to be one Nuptial Night, Their Stock wou'd never be exhausted quite; Then, on their Natural Fund they might rely, And not so lavishly take in Supply. Name but a Kitchin to the Lady fair, She crys, O filthy! What shou'd I do there? Not thinking that the more she knows, the less, By consequenee, she's blam'd for Foolishness. Her Offices she never comes into, Or scarce knows one from 'tother, if she do; Full of themselves, they nothing else can see; Tho' Mothers, yet their Pocket-Glass shall be Look'd into oftner than their Nursery: Mark, in this Town, if there's not many a one That hugs her Monky oftner than her Son, (And, faith we scarce know which is most her own: 'Tis that she cheers and Fondles all she can, And loves the nearest Print of it in Man: The vilest Fop whom Nature did create For nothing but to Cringe, to Grin and Prate, Fraught with more Fashion, Nonsense, Lyes, Grimace, Than e'er before were crowded into Ass, Let him appear, th'unnatural Brute's receiv'd, Nor only Lov'd, but which is worse, Believ'd! Yet Sloath's not only to that Sex confin'd, But has a large Dominion in Mankind. Wou'd not that Noble Coxcomb raise our Mirth, That thinks his Laziness declares his Birth, Joyn'd with a Resolution, ne'er to get Out of a Mercenary Rascal's Debt? Of all the Blockheads that debase their Kind, No Wretch more Vile and Scandalous we find, Than he, that for Respect and Honour looks, Yet over Head and Ears in Trades-Mens Books: (Not that we shou'd despise the Man that's poor; But these look bigger, as their Wants grow more: If Quality can stoop so very low, What is't it may not condescend to do? Dissolv'd in Idleness, he grows a Drone, And neither Eats, or Drinks, or wears his now; But spunges on the Labours of the Poor, Who, trusting Them, make but their Wants the more. Their Servants Wages, if they ever pay, I warn the lucky Wretch to make no Stay, Let him go off with Money, while he may; For Quality has long the Trick profest, To bilk the yearly Hireling with the rest. A Man that's doom'd to serve so loose a Knave, Is sunk down ten Degrees beneath a Slave: And who his Life wou'd in that Drudgery spend, When, shou'd he hang himself, his Case wou'd mend? In short, to Cheat, and to be Impudent When Duns appear, is the last Element, (And by meer Choice it so it self involves) To which Decaying Quality resolves. The lesser Gentry, rather that Abroad Serve in their Countries cause, infest the Road; But a Thief's Valour no true Praise deserves, For any Coward rather Fights than Starves. 'Tis not that Providence, as Atheists feign, Has made more Creatures than it can maintain; All Men may thrive, at least, thus far you'll grant, By just Endeavours rise above their Want: Who did you ever yet in Tatters see, That did exert his utmost Industry? For no Man Fortune does so far forsake, But he may sometimes give, as well as take. But 'tis meer Sloath, incorporate with his Blood, And Pride, that says 'tis slavish to be Good, That it betrays a Base, a Vulgar Mind, To seek by Industry their Bread to find;— As if 'twere Great to prey upon their Kind; As if the Wolf were e'er the better Beast, Because more Bold and Rav'nous than the rest, And on the Blood of Innocence will Feast. From these the Muse with Detestation flies, And streight, what more she loaths, the Spend-thrift spies: Preposterous Fop! that thinks it an Abuse To put his Money to the Genuine Use, As if no Gentleman, if not Profuse. See how he deals it out as he comes on, And with both Hands too, as 'twou'd ne'er be gone! You'd swear he study'd, or he understood How to live all his Life, and do no Good. A Guinea she that gives his Lust Relief Bears off, a Guinea he that cleans his Teeth, A Guinea he that brings him a Lampoon, To Peaceable a Guinea for a Tune; A Guinea where he Dines, among the Men, The Dedication of a Play is Ten, His Peruke five, and his Point Ruffles four, His Beaver three, his Lac'd Coat fifteen more, And then Five hundred to his Annual Whore: Besides his Coach, his Horses, and his Slaves, His Parasites, his Pimps and Hireling Braves, Must be conceiv'd to wast a Countless Sum; From what vast Bank can all this Treasure come? What English Land, or Indian Mine can last, When the vain Animal does spend so fast? Rich, tho' he be, when to that Vice inclin'd, He Blazes like a Candle in the Wind, And, gratifying all his loose Desires, Is melted down, and in a Snuff expires: Tho' Wealth and Power does in his Van appear, Want and a Jayl does still bring up the Reer; A Jayl is the Inevitable Lot Of an Extravagant and heedless Sot. Shook by a thousand Debts, the Prodigal Does, in effect, like the Colossus fall; Too ponderous to lift up, like that, he lies, And as unable, of himself, to rise. Thus, that this Vice proceeds from Gold we see, For without that, no Prodigality. That Avarice from that, too, takes its Birth Is true, as that the Churl has his from Earth: But this Notorious Crime it were a Shame To offer to Convict, or to Reclaim; Nor was it here to lash it our Intent, 'Tis to it self a sharper Punishment. What Plagues upon a Miser can you throw, Worse than that, One of his Continuing so? May then these Slaves (by Contradiction ill) Gripe, Scrape, be close and Avaritious still, Gaze on his Gold, think that his only Good, And so be Damn'd for grutching himself Food. But as the Wretch is Covetous that Hoards, So some are Covetous to spread their Boards; By Power supported (Rapine their Delight) They set no Bounds to their wild Appetite; Whate'er they Covet they think lawful Prize, So Lawlesly the Labourer's Substance seize, And all to dwell in Wantonness and Ease: The needy Churl we may, almost, excuse, But these are Covetous to be Profuse. What a strange Madness does these Fools betray? That Rake together just to throw away, And give that Wings that ne'er was known to stay. The Former errs in knowing not the Use: This in the Getting, then in the Abuse: Haughty, yet condescends to crush the Poor, To cram his Belly, and to pay his Whore. Thus Luxury's maintain'd by Avarice; But then another sort, as bad as this, Has from Hereditary Wealth its Rise: Extant in them who in their Bills of Fare Summon, at once, the Earth, the Sea, the Air: The Elements must all their Bounties show, As if not what they Gave but what they Owe, And must pay in when they will have it so. The want e'en of a Trifle's not endur'd, Tho' by th'extremest Art and Charge procur'd. Nature is forc'd, as if most good they find In Fruits and Plants before they're ripe, by kind. Not a more num'rous Army Xerxes led, Than these, by Name, have Dishes to be fed: More barbarous Terms we now in Cookery see, Than in that barb'rous Myst'ry Heraldry; And as those Terms distinguish Gentry there, So Fricasies, Ragousts and Soups do here— And both, alike, their Wit and Worth declare. That God made all for Man we all agree, But then 'twas for his Use, not Luxury; He did not open his unbounded Store, Only to Feast the Rich, and Starve the Poor; Tho' now they Lord it o'er the Meaner Sort, And make their Labours and their Wants their Sport; Voluptuously, all Nature's Rarities, (As if by Charter theirs) Monopolize: Yet tho' they've All, they think they're treated rough, And, like the Barren Womb, ne'er say—Enough. What a sad Sentence on these Men will fall At the last dreadful Trump, the general Call? When, notwithstanding all their Wealth and Power, They murmur'd more, the more they did devour: Tho' Heav'n sent Quails, and tho' it Manna rain'd, They, like the stubborn Israelites, complain'd; The more its Miracles appeal'd to Sense, The less they'd be convinc'd of Providence: While the Poor Man, which (if we may presume So far) must strangely aggravate their Doom, While he, resign'd, by his just Labour fed, Liv'd Pleas'd and Thankful upon Scraps of Bread. O Poverty! thou only Blessing, sent From Heav'n, if thou'rt attended with Content; She on that Hand, and Honesty on this, And thou art, then the greatest Human Bliss: Not Cæsar, Lepidus, and Antony, Did make so famous a Triumviri As you, O you much more illustrious Three! Wealth has no Centre, endlesly aspires, Yet ne'er can reach the Height it so admires, As there to pitch and fix her Wild Desires: But Poverty close to the Ground does go, And hugs the Fate that lets her walk so low; No fall she fears, contented to be Just, She sinks beneath Ambition, Rage and Lust: Envy her self, that takes the surest Aim, Cares not for stooping to such prostrate Game. So Storms on Mountains the tall Cedar tears Up by the Roots, the humble Shrub it spares. O Blessed State! which God was pleas'd to bear While, in the Flesh, he sojourn'd with us here; He knew thy lovely Dress wou'd best agree With Peace, with Truth, and with Humility: Thy Badge, too, all his mighty Followers bore, And wou'd be what their Saviour was before; What Wretch, then, wou'd Repine that he is Poor? Bounded by Thee, w'ave no desire to ly On Beds of Down, or Offices to buy, Which, rightly took, is but Lay-Simony;— 'Tis to that common Clergy-Crime a Brother, And one is punish'd now no more than 'tother. He that has Money can't Preferment want; Let him be Coward, Atheist, Ignorant, He streight grows, Wise a Hero, and a Saint. As once was said, knock, it shall open'd be, Seek you shall find—so in this World, we see, And most at Court, when e'er the Penny's shown, The Heav'n of bought Preferment is your own. Some, Places buy, because they'll Courtiers grow, And some, again, because they must be so, Above the fear of Paying what they owe; There they, secure, as in Alsatia, rest, Alsatia, of the two Retreats the best; There you, unearth the Fox, Relief may have; But here there is no reaching of a Knave: And while they, thus, a sure Protection find, They are but Authoriz'd to cheat Mankind: A Villain that will use this Privilege, Cuts like a Sword that has a double Edge; May arrest you, yet fear not an arrest, Always oppressing, not to be opprest: Thus, owe a World, 'tis this way even made, Get but a Place at Court, your Debts are paid: 'Tis hence the vilest Offices are bought, They fall not half so fast as they are sought. Five hundred Guineas (faith the Bargain's hard) Only to Cock a Hat, and mount the Guard: Fantastick Ape! that struts in Scarlet Cloaths, And has of Souldier, nothing but the Oaths. Little his Father thought (who had been long Getting the Sum, and from his Tenants wrung It half by Indirectness) that his Soul Was pawn'd, to make his Eldest-Born a Fool. What Man can think that Money justly gain'd, By which a Villain's Vanity's maintain'd? 'Tis true, the Wars (which don't their Natures suit) Has shook, perhaps, these Locusts from the Fruit; But who that, lately, wou'd Hyde-Park survey, Did not see many a Coxcomb that took Pay, Only to ride a Cock-horse on May-Day? His Credit just for Rabble-Praise to sell, And bowing to the Ladies in Pell-Mell; While prancing on, and straining to look fierce, And his fine Scarf hung dangling at his Arse, The whole Town was diverted with the Farce. In vain the honest Man is Brave, or Wise, When any Money'd Fop so soon may rise; If but a Scavenger does tender Gold, The Man of Birth and Worth is bought and sold: For he that can no better Merit bring Than Loving of his Country, or his King, May e'en go whistle for Advancement there; His Lung's too fine to breath in such an Air. In short all things are bought; Buying's so rife, Fools Knighthoods buy, the Murtherer buys his Life, And, which is worse, ev'n Grandio bought his Wife; A thousand Guineas down and down were told, Before the Pander did produce the Scold: But, if to have her, the preposterous Sot Cou'd let so large a Parcel go to Pot, What wou'd he give that, now, he had her not? Enough of Buying between Fool and Rogue: But Begging is, at Court, as much in Vogue, And 'tis a sort of Begging baser far, Than all the vilest ways of Bribery are. The Natural Fool that has a Great Estate, Is, to the Courtier, grown a luscious Bait: But if Estates are forfeit by the Laws, When Fools are Heirs (tho' Fools by Natural Cause) Half of the Gentry must their Lands resign, For why is theirs more privileg'd than thine? In short, wou'd not a near Relation's Care Cherish the Ideot, the Soft-moulded Heir, More tenderly than any thread-bare Lord, Of all the Hundreds fil'd upon Record? Profit makes one take Care, and Nature t'other; What Love is like the Yernings of a Mother? Unhappiness enough she knew that bore So sad a Weight, but this does make it more: Depriv'd of all that Mothers make their Boast; Because she lost her Hope, must all be lost? Why shou'd such senseless Cruelty be shown? Why punish'd for an Error not her own? 'Twas Nature's Crime, who sometimes is in hast, For when a Fool is form'd she works too fast, And letting but the grosser Substance pass, Shuts out the Mind, that shou'd inform the Mass; At the next Tryal, she her Bungling mends, And thither too, of Right, th'Estate descends: The Birth-Right Esau's Folly did refuse; What he deserv'd not, Jacob did not lose. But if 'tis fit, Fools shou'd be begg'd at all, Of all Sorts, we shou'd spare the Natural; The acquir'd Coxcomb shou'd the Person be, That's so of Choice, not of Necessity: This way some equal Justice might be shown, For those that beg Estates might lose their own. Must a whole Linage perish, undeserv'd, Because without their Lands a Fop had starv'd? Whatever made this Custom first prevail, Morality still told another Tale; For, let us fairly ask, is it to do, What you wou'd have your Issue done unto? Nor is it only Fools that suffer hence, Th'Affliction falls too oft on Men of Sense; Thou—dost of this th'Example stand, Thy Case is known and pity'd thro' the Land. With these Court-Beggars, we may fitly joyn The Slaves in Office that Collect their Coin: Tell me (O Stewards!) that do all you can When you are Dealing with the Labouring Man, With Plausible Discourse and Artifice, To screw him up to the extremest Price; Making him give (if he don't understand Your Craft) as much for Copy-hold as Land; Yet, after all, there comes thy Lady's Fee, Five Guineas—(which, perhaps, she ne'er does see) Because y'ave us'd him well, five more to Thee: Tell me behind what Shift thou canst retreat, T'avoid the Imputation of a Cheat? Perhaps, you may this dull Reply afford, Thou dost it for the Interest of thy Lord; The worse, that can a Villains Name obtain, Without the least Incouragement of Gain, It shews thy Guilt does in thy Nature grow, And that 'tis not by Chance, but Choice, y'are so. But tho' their Interest you pretend, 'tis known, By Proofs Infallible, you mean your Own. How can you spend so fast, and live so high, New houses build, and New Possessions buy, And get some Hundred Pounds, per Annum, clear, Out of, at most, but Fifty Pounds a Year? Yet, tho' so bad, we justly may allow The Man that does protect thee worse than Thou, Who, tho' he's sure thou art a Knave, employs Thee still, and so whole Families destroys. But that which grieves me more, is, when I see A Lawyer made a Steward, or Trustee; Cormorants, that neither Lord or Tenant spare, But Banter one, and strip the other bare: An Honest Lawyer wou'd a Monster be, But who, alive, e're saw that Prodigy. As Profligate, a braz'd Case-hardn'd Race, As ever yet had Infamy in Chase: Knights of the Post, that perjur'd Oaths will take As fast as Pills, much better Christians make, And have, without Contrition, more pretence, To Heav'n than these with all their Penitence; For Ign'rance, joyn'd with strong Necessity, Does sometimes goad Men on to Villany; 'Tis certain when w'are born we must be fed, And what won't starving Rascals do for Bread? But what can those Men urge in their Defence, That rowl in Wealth, and are indu'd with Sense? Yet Lye, Deceive, Cheat, Ravage, Crush and Grind, As if they'd sworn to ruine Human-kind. Just as the Vulture, Tiger, Wolf, and Bear, By Nature, nothing in their Fury spare; So he, that does to study Law encline, By Nature, is as Rav'nous after Coin; Only this Difference does between 'em light, Those better Brutes for Hunger kill and fight, Destroy for Need, which he does for Delight: So Cruel, his own Kindred he'll not save; When Born, his Stars their sharpest Influence gave, And turn'd his Constitution to a Knave. Knavery's his Life, his Soul, his utmost Sphere; But Virtue makes him gape like Fish in Air, That pure thin Element he cannot bear. Ah Wretch! that so can to be Rich presume, Yet think not on the Rich Man's dreadful Doom! Happy that glorious Man, thrice happy he, That, tho' possest of Riches, yet, can be From all the Crimes that it produces free; Who, Spight of that Temptation to be ill, Can his Desires and Wealth command at will; What God design'd his Servant, manage so, As ne'er to let it his proud Master grow; Ungovern'd, then, as Water, or as Fire, Who, tho' for Servants we so much admire, Yet ruin all when they to rule aspire; That does the Genuine Use of Money know, And, serv'd himself, the Surplus can bestow; That does believe Compassion of the Poor, A truer Key to Heaven's Eternal Door, Than all the Merits of his Birth and Store; That does with Virtue, Peace and Truth comply, The Centre of his Actions, Charity, The Camel then goes thro' the Needle's Eye! But where? O where! (and search the Land around) Can Ten of these enlightned Souls be found? Cou'd Ten be found, they wou'd atone our Crimes, And, by their Blest Example, fix the Times, Keep all Calamities from entring here, Plague, Famine, Sword, and Fire we need not fear; Our Sodom had not burnt, had ten such Lots been there, Nor, first, with Plague, call'd to repent her Sin; But when is her Conversion to begin? The only Fear of all, methinks, shou'd be. When such Transcendency of Soul we see, We shou'd fall back to flat Idolatry; In them the Image of the Power Divine Does with so perfect a Resemblance Shine, That, tho' no Gods, they're scarce of Human-Line! Instead of these, a Brutal Race we see, Compos'd of Pride, of Spite and Cruelty: The Poor (their kinder Dogs will lick their Sores) Like Lazarus, are driven from their Doors; Their needy Neighbours made eternal Slaves, At least, they have no Ease, but in their Graves, That silent, kind Retreat from Fools and Knaves: Not Busby's more despotick in his School, Than these are in the Villages they Rule. The Sat'rist may th'Abuse of Riches mourn, Or blame th'Abuser, but he meets with Scorn, For, streight they cry—You like the Fox impeach, And but dispraise the Fruit you cannot reach: Did you but know the Blessings of our Store, You'd rather choose Damnation than be Poor: The Rich Man Rules Assemblies with a Nod, His Steps are by a Train of Followers trod; Where e're he turns his Eyes; Respect he sees, And bending Crowds salute him on their Knees; The States-Man, Courtier, Souldier, Scholar joyn In their Esteem, and Bless the Man of Coin. While base, opprobrious Want does skulk and hide, Loath'd by her self, and shun'd by all beside; And then the Term of Idle to prevent, She calls her sneaking Poverty, Content— Thus they run on, and that Seraphick State, Conferr'd but on Heav'n's choicest Favourites, Hate; A State, did Angels live on Earth, they'd choose, A State, next to the Loss of Heaven to lose, And only Man and Devils can abuse. But tell me, Sons of Earth, ye Sordid Crew, That wou'd deceive our Souls by specious Shew, And to your own, add our Destruction too; Tell me if Money from Perdition saves, Or keeps you e'er the longer from your Graves? Can it preserve your Bodies (tho' your Bed Be Down, and tho' your Tomb be hoop'd with Lead) From Stinking Living, and from Rotting Dead? Can it the Charges of your Crimes defray? Or Bribe the Jury on the Judgment-Day? Can it procure, in Pain, a Moment's Ease? Make Pleasure last? or Disappointments please? Honour, you cry, and all her Blessings wait On his Command that has a large Estate; O fond Mistake! a thousand things he wants, Which God ev'n to the meanest Creature grants: Richer than Crassus, though the Muck-worm be, He may not have a Grain of Charity, Of Courage, Justice, Fortitude, of Truth, Of Sense, of Prudence, Beauty, or of Youth; And, last of all, that Blessed Peace of Mind May want in Death, which ev'n the poorest find. To all Temptation he lies open still; For he that has the Means ne'er wants the Will, So, almost by Necessity is ill. To Women does your Inclination lie? This brings you in a numberless Supply— But Women are so Cheap that all may buy: To Villany, or Wine, then, bend your Mind, To Sins of the most Black or Scarlet-Kind, Gold is the readiest Prompter you can find; Dare you to act, your Cue you shall not miss, But down you go, tho' Hell the Precipice: He is not, then, the Favourite of Heav'n, Where there is much but where enough is giv'n, Of all the several Fates that Mortals share, His is most Sad, his is the most Severe, That has (O dreadful Doom!) his Portion here; That in this Life does his good things receive, And whom, when dying, his Enjoyments leave: The Pale-fac'd Tyrant's Call he must obey, He dares not go, yet knows he must not Stay, Nor bear the Wealth, he so admires, away; But, opening the Inevitable Gate, Hopeless of Heav'n, does shoot the Gulph of Fate. How dismal will the Flaming Prospect shew, When Hell and full Damnation come in view? In vain he'll, then, his Crimes and Follies mourn, The deeper plung'd for thinking of Return. Then will he feel, and feeling Rue, how vain He was, to trust in curst, ill gotten Gain: These Lines (which we expect he'll laugh at here) Will then a sad a dreadful Truth appear: Then he will wish (Ah wretched Wish! too late) He had believ'd, or fear'd a future State, Why (O ye Pow'rs!) was Man so Subject made, To be by Gold that glittering Toy, betray'd? Or as the Fire tries that, was that to be The Test and Tryal of our Honesty? Or was it gave (that way our Judgment leans) To shew how ill we are when we have Means? Or was it, meerly, of Compassion sent, To mind us of that future Punishment Which it does so exactly Represent? For as those Souls to endless Burnings doom'd Are ever undiminish'd, unconsum'd, That Substance, so, in Flames abides entire, And lies Immortal in the Arms of Fire. Howe'er it is, of this we may be sure, By Nature we'ave a thousand Crimes in Store, And that Subjects us to ten thousand more; Yes, cursed Mineral! Eve did in the Fall, Thy Project of Damnation but fore-stall. Against our Consciences you stem the Tyde; In vain we'ave Truth and Reason on our side, When you assume the Chair, and grow our Guide: We know w'are wicked, yet thou goad'st us on, As if our Mortal Race wou'd ne'er be run. Injurious Truths you to the World reveal, And on black Falshoods fix an endless Seal: The Tongue of horrid Murthers thou hast ty'd; And Innocence for Guilt as oft decry'd: Oft has the Guiltless Wretch been Gibbet-high, Seen swinging, and the Murtherer smiling by. Nothing was e'er so wicked, Old or New, But thou hast done, or art prepar'd to do; Crimes that deserve more than for Fiends was meant, And Hell can't equal in the Punishment. For thee the Friend proves Faithless to his Trust, And Mothers Bawd to their own Daughters Lust; At twelve years Age, expose the Girl to sale, For at fifteen she will be found too Stale: What in her riper Whoredoms will she be, When she does Pox with her Virginity? For thee the Husband (to himself unjust) Does wink at, or allow his Spouse's Lust; And, tho' he but enjoy'd her just before, Can rise and open her Gallants the Door. For thee, if by hard Fate he cannot thrive, The well-bred Wife does her poor Husband leave; She thinks below her Character she goes, And can't be Honest in unmodish Cloaths. In vain her Spouse believ'd her plighted Troth, Her Virgin Vows, and Sacred Marriage Oath; A Tye sufficient her loose Faith to bind: Unless a plenteous Maintenance she find, Wedded to him, she's Bedded to Mankind. For thee the Buffoon is a Foe profest To all that's good, and lives and dies a Beast: Pay'd to make Mirth, he cannot Witty be Without the help of loose Scurrility, Of Irreligion, or of Ribaldry: Thus, not by Wit, but Wickedness possest, He does but Damn himself to clinch his Jest. For Thee the Cit not only Truth denies, But Solemnly calls God to vouch his Lyes: His Faith and Conscience he does pawn so fast, 'Tis to be wonder'd how the Stock does last. As just as he that Steals for his Relief, For what's a Tradeseman but a licens'd Thief. For Thee his Wife (too cunning for the Man) Does cheat the Cheater all that Woman can: Yet to the Fop an Angel she appears, And is so Fond, that it breaks out in Tears: His ready Cash he to her Care does trust, And laughs at those that think their Wives unjust, Mean while she, like a Leech, does drain him dry, Than ranges all the Town for a Supply: Frequents the Exchanges, Parks and Plays, and strikes A Bargain up with every One she likes; And let 'em do their best, for as their Play Is, More or Less, 'tis answer'd in their Pay. What shall we say? but that if Villany, Has any Bounds (as yet we ne'er cou'd see Its utmost Pillars are set up by Thee: In vain we wou'd the Ills you cause unfold, If we write Ages, half will be untold, Ev'n Women, in comparison of Thee, Use wretched Men with some Humanity— They Damn one Part, and you the other Three. JACK PAVY, A SATYR. TO The Right Honourable JAMES, Earl of ABINGDON, &amp;c. He that encreases Knowledge encreases Sorrow. 'Tis true, dear Jack, y'are of all Sense bereft, Nor can the Right distinguish from the Left, Observ'st no Seasons, Reason, Right, or Rule; In short, thou art, indeed, a Nat'ral Fool: And hence we some so inconsid'rate find To think thee the most lost of Humankind: But I who ever yet have took delight To follow Truth, and vindicate the Right, Must say thou art abus'd;—No Man can be More the Immediate Care of Heaven than Thee. Your Standard Fool, the Fool we shou'd despise, Is the Vain Coxcomb that believes He's Wise. And first, for a Foundation, I wou'd know What Man can be Intirely Blest below If not as Dull as Thou:—the Turns of Fate (What e'er their Birth, Vocation, or Estate,) Promiscuously on all the Wiser wait: Grief, Disappointment, Shame, Distrust and Fear Extend to all; each has so large a Share, That who has least has more than He can bear. Either his best Diversions quickly cloy, Prey on themselves, and so themselves Destroy, Or some sharp Cross dismounts his tow'ring Joy: In vain He toils for Pleasure, 'twon't be found, But flies the Searcher like Enchanted Ground, And in a Maze of sorrow leads him round and round. That Man must then be happiest who can here, Amidst such Various Ills, live free from Care, And, as He nothing Hopes, does nothing Future Fear: This is the Point to which thy Fate aspires; And Heav'n no more than what it gives, requires; Lays on our Minds Restraints we well might bear, Were we less Proud of being what we are: For one that Errs, (Unjust to his Deserts,) By a too low Conception of his Parts, Ten thousand daily strike upon the Shelves By thinking nothing Wiser than themselves: In short, no Mortal we can happy Call Whose Lot between the two Extremes does fall Of Knowing Nothing, and of Knowing All. But grant there are some Men Divinely Good, (As Gracious Heav'n avert but that we shou'd;) Grant Vertue is alone their strictest Care, And that they've all a Human Frame can bear; Nay grant from ev'ry Anxious Thought they're free, (Which yet is an Impossibility,) They in this World can be but blest like Thee; But in the next thy Joys will far Transcend What they can hope, or by Good Deeds pretend; For since by Merit Heav'n can ne'er be gain'd, Happiest, by whom 'tis with least Sin attain'd: Then Happiest Thou! whose Lot it will befall To reach that State without being Criminal: A Fate the wisest never cou'd attain With all the Reading, all their Stretch of Brain; Th'Attempt shall be Rewarded, but th'Attempt it self is vain. Our Parent, Jack, the first Created Man, (If Mysteries Divine we ought to Scan,) While yet in Perfect Innocence He stood, Cou'd not, perhaps, boast so Entire a Good As is on Thee, (Heav'ns Greater Care,) bestow'd. His State of Sweetness soon was dash'd with Gall; Thou Stand'st, and art not liable to Fall: In Solid Dullness fixt, no Charms, no Art Of Beauty makes Impression on thy Heart: The Faithless Sex cou'd ne'er thy Fancy move, For ever Proof against the Shafts of Love: Who at their Feet e'er saw Thee Prostrate ly, And sigh, and Grieve, and Weep, and Bleed and dy? As some, who, like the Heathen World of Yore, First make the Diety, and then adore; A Light Demeanour and a Painted Face, No Wit, no Vertue, with much Silks and Lace, Pass with such Fops for a Resistless Grace; But reach not Thee;—so Strongly You retain Your Native Ply, were Eve to live again, And Labour to Seduce Thee, 'twere in vain. Ah! had old Adam been as dull, as Good, Eden had not been lost, and Man had stood. Ambition, which destroys the Statesman's Rest, Ne'er gains the least Admittance to thy Breast. Without a Pang thou dost see Others rise, And take their Glorious Station in the Skies; See 'em look back with a Disdainful Eye On those whose Bounty gave 'em Wings to fly. Without Concern again You see 'em come From their vast height to an Ignoble Doom, Like Stars they Glitter, and as swift decline; But ne'er, like them, must rise again to shine! What Man from low Beginnings ever grew Mighty and Rich, without being Vitious, too? With what Derision they the Poor behold! How fond to have their Tinsell pass for Gold! Pride is a thing too obvious to conceal; It puffs the Heart as Butchers do their Veal; Looks fair without, but probe the hidden Mind Th'Impostume breaks, and mixing with the Wind, Just like a blazing Taper (which Inspires Bends threat'ning round, and it's own Glare Admires) Turns all to Snuff, and in a stench Expires. Nor in the War You labour for a Name By cutting Throats;—the Hero's way to Fame. Search thro' the Race of Brutes, and You will find There's nothing preys so much upon his Kind As we, that boast of an Immortal Mind. Cities are tumbl'd down and Temples rac'd The sooner, as they're Sacred Piles, defac'd; Nor is there any Hope these Feuds shou'd cease Till we are all like Thee; then all wou'd be at Peace. In Thee no Covetous Desires we find, That Griping, Restless Colick of the Mind: Here One, bewitch'd with the base Itch of Gain, Can his Pursuits within no Bounds contain, Against nought else but want of Cash does pray, Dreams on't all Night, and hugs it all the Day, Yet Conscious He can carry none away: Nay tho' so large a Mass He does receive, No Devil can in Flames more restless live Than he to see a Generous Neighbour thrive; Wond'ring the Partial Pow'rs shou'd bless his Store, And see it so Imbezzel'd on the Poor. This Plague for ever is to Thee unknown; Rich in thy Badge of Cloath, and Parish Gown, In Peace, You let each Man enjoy his Own. Envy in vain thy Quiet wou'd devour, Not that She's short in Will, but wanting in her Pow'r: She finds the Foe too fearless to attack, Goes cursing off, and grins as she looks back. The silly Sex, indeed, She does Entice; For Envy chiefly is a Female Vice: Rather than not Revenge they'll Witches grow; But while around their Hurtful Charms they throw They're curst above, and double damn'd below. Mark but the Course of things, and You must own Most Men do that they'd rather let alone: Thinks on his Present State with Watry Eyes, And, prone to Change, with ev'ry Wish complies; And fain wou'd be the Thing his Fate denies. Roving Desires perplex his Labouring thought, Still seeking, and still Missing what is sought: Against the Stream of Disappointment strives, In vain—for back th'Impet'ous Torrent drives, And makes Him, to his Lasting Anguish, see His Expectations all Incertainty: Toss'd like a Bubble, to and fro he rouls, And ev'ry Trifle his Resolve controuls: Alike a Slave tho' Fortune-frown or Smile, Fond of his Cares, and Wedded to his Toil: And all, alas! to have his Bantlings fed; But 'tis a Fate that ever yet has sped, The less the Slav'ry still the more the Bread. The Trading Cit, Smooth-Tongu'd, Demure, and sly, Who never Swears, unless 'tis to a Lie, Gets more a Day by Perjur'ing off his Ware, Than serves the Needy Labourer a Year: He gets,—but curst is his Ill gotten Store; Rather than so be Rich, let me, Ye Pow'rs be poor. Here One his dozen Voiages performs, Ploughs the rough Waves, and Combates Winds and Storms; And thus he Drudges many tedious Years; The Merchant, wreck'd at Home with Wretched Fears, Thinks on the Winds, the Rocks, the Sands, and Pirates of Argiers: Expects 'em long; at last, perchance, they come Without their Lading, Tempest-beaten, home. Thus for a Bootless Voiage he is hurl'd From East to West, and Bandy'd thro' the World. But say he gains (as many, we confess, Succeed, that don't deserve the least Success;) What lasting what Substantial Pleasure can Attend this Wealthy, Careful, Restless Man? What Satisfaction can he compass here That's truely Temp'erate, Real, and sincere, Not to be had for Fifty Pounds a year? What tho' he takes from a Luxurious Store? Let Nature be suffic'd, I'll ask no more. Tho' his Vault's cram'd with Chios and Moselle, And of a Hundred Names too long to tell, I have my Bottle, and that does as well. But after all his Outward Pomp and show, Tho' high his Pride, his Credit may be low: Nay many of 'em (found too sadly true) Have dy'd in Debt, and many Thousands too; Which (tho' a Poet) I wou'd scorn to do. For Rents here Spendall to the Country goes, And when Receiv'd, thinks all He meets are Foes; Fears his own Shadow dogs him with Design To cut his Throat, and Rob him of his Coin: And 'twou'd be well some Charitable Thief This way, or that, wou'd give the Fop Relief: Much better so, than 'tis to wast his Days In Drinking, Whoring, Gaming, Balls and Plays. In the Mean time the Rich Litigious Clown Hies up as fast as t'other hurries Down: 'Tis Term, and He has Business at the Hall; Stingy at Home, but there He parts with all. Long Rueful Scrawls his Lawyers bring him in, With Lines so wide a Coach might drive between But flatter'd with the Justice of his Cause, He draws his Purse, and yet again he draws, Till all the Cash is in the Harpies Claws: Then back Returns his Pocket to recruit, And knows not Money does prolong the Suit. So when y'are Feeing your Physician still, You do but bribe the Brute to keep you Ill. Another's to be Marry'd all in speed; But first there must be drawn some tedious Deed, In which more Caution's us'd than if he were Making his Will, or Naming of an Heir. A Jointure's settl'd, (let her Laugh that Wins,) A Thousand Pound a Year to buy her Pins, Unthinking Wretch! or one might say possess'd! To pay so much for Parting with his Rest! For say, at first, she were both Chast and True, What Mischief can't so much Per-Annum do? Many, that have been thought Divinely Good, For less have dipt their Hands in Husband's Blood. This Thought at last Works busie in his Brain; Drudge on, fond Ass, You now but grieve in vain; Be still Obsequious, give her no Offence, Lest she takes Pet, and sends thee Packing hence. There an Attendance-Dancer of the Court To the Levee's and Couchee's makes resort; Where in more Shapes He does his Body Screw Than those that Dance thro' Hoops, or Smithfield Tumblers do: Yet all the while has Sense enough to tell Flatt'ry's a Crime, and that he does not well. Now to a Bishop he devoutly bends, Next to an Atheist the same Zeal pretends; Now to a Beef-eater he cringes low, Now to some Wealthy Bawd, or Tawdry Beau, And to ten Thousand he can never know: And all this while so Talkative, you'll see His Tongue is quite as pliant as his Knee: Coward thro'out; for were his Soul at all With Fire endu'd, what does he at White-hall? Where there has never been advanc'd of late Truth in the Church, or Valour in the State. Thus a Precarious Life he vilely spends, Begun with Fawning, and in Beggary ends. Here to the Park an Am'rous Coxcomb hies To meet his Love among the Butterflies, Which there abound, and swell into a Crowd, Pert, Pocky, Poor, Impertinent and Loud: Coming, He finds his Rival in her Hand, Her Smiles, her Looks, her—all at his Command: Then Sighs and Raves he ever shou'd believe A Perjur'd thing, whose Nature's to deceive: Nor sits he down contented with his Wrongs, Till with cold Steel the other probes his Lungs. Another Buffoon, cherish'd by the Great, Burlesques the Scriptures, and Blasphemes to eat: Nor is this Court-bred Humour strange, or new, For who knows Fan?hw, knows it to be true: Thus he drives on, unmindful of the Foe, Nor sees the brandish'd Sword above, or dreadful Steep below. Thus go, and thus have ever gone the Times, Each Age Improving on their Father's Crimes: And we, on whom the Dregs of Time are come, Are casting up the horrid Total Sum. As Poesie shou'd in no Medium fall, But be Divinely Good, or not at all, Nothing of late for Wickedness will go, But what, indeed, Transcendently is so! The Man that cannot now to Blood proceed Without the least Compunction for the Deed, Blaspheme, Betray, tho' Kindred of his Own, Is Banish'd from the Publick Hive a Drone. The very Courts that shou'd our Wrongs redress Are Fraud, Extortion, Bribery to Excess: Ev'n Innocence we there shall Censur'd see, While some abandon'd to dark Villany, Are gentl'y dealt with, if not let go free! A safe Retreat from Injury none can know; Abroad, at Home, w'are of certain the Foe: Or black Detraction blasts our Credit there, Or a shrill Tongue confounds our quiet here. There in our View are spread the Baits for Sin, Nor less the Passions Storm our Souls within. Or Envy robs us of the Sweets of Rest, Or Jealousie does Triumph in his Breast; Unhappy Mortal! with that Fiend Possess'd! Distended on the Rack, there to remain Whole Ages, is a yet more moderate Pain: O horrid Doom! O worse than Hellish Life!— Yet who wou'd have a Fool without a Wife? But Thou Supine, in Pleasure's easie Arms Dost lye Intranc'd, and tast of all her Charms, If some by Pleasure what I mean enquire, I Answer—that which comes to Thee entire, Without the Previous Trouble of Desire: What others want, they're restless till they have, So 'tis by Consequence a Pain to Crave. Nor yet alone in This thou art supply'd Above us, but in every Good beside. Tho' the wide World with Blood and Ruin's vext, Thou'rt Easie, Free, Secure, and Unperplext. When Dreadful Comets in the Skies ascend, You're not Concern'd what Changes they portend. Nay shou'd You live, (co-equal with your Fame,) Till the last Gene'ral Conflagration came, Thou wou'dst but laugh, and warm Thee at the Flame. Thou for to Morrow never dost prepare, Like servile Slaves that earn their Bread with Care. By Certain Instinct taught, you Drink and Eat, And, tho', but coarsely Cook'd, dost crave no better Meat; While we who Nicely do that Knowledge boast, Shou'd have less Guilt if Totally 'twere lost: For once, at Meals, that Temperance over-awes, A Thousand times we Violate her Laws: The Happiest Station Human Life propounds, Is there, where Nothing's wanting, or abounds. There is no doubting His Condition best, Whose Peace and Vertue are expos'd the least. Nor art thou, with the Crowd of Formal Fools, Ty'd vainly up to Ceremonious Rules: Free from that empty Custom thou dost live; You pay no Visits, and You none Receive: While we Impertinently waste the Day In Trifling Chat, and Squander Life away. See here a Mother mourning for her Boy, Late all her Future Hope, and Earthly Joy: Tearing her Hair, and with Affliction wild. She'll not be Comforted, or Reconcil'd; Unhappy Mother! but O happy Child! Free from the Woes with which thy Parents strive, Whose Cruel Kindness wish thee still alive. Another there for his poor Father mourns, In vain—alas! the Grave makes no Returns; Thinks Heav'n Unkind the Good old Man has past Some Fourscore Winters, and must Dye at last; When, if we own Age weak and Sorrow strong, 'Twas half a Miracle he liv'd so long. A Third you'll see sit whining for his Wife Farewell (he cries) the Sweets and Joys of Life!— Yet, Living, he ne'er knew an Hour but Strife. This touches not thy Breast; thy Father's gone, And Mother, yet who ever heard thee Moan? Thy Resignation such, so free from Blame, It does deserve a more Exalted Name; Ev'n Saints have less, and Angels but the same. Observe the Man who has all Sin engrost, And see if He is not the Man who most Aspires to Wit; but any Fool may see, (So plain, it must be Visible to Thee) How the Pretence and Conduct disagree: So eager all that's Wicked to retain, You'd think He wou'd not spare the Fools a Grain: A very Bugbear! so Licentious grown, He is the Standard-Scandal of the Town. Who more a Fop? and, which is worse, who more A Slave to Dice, and Cully to the Whore? Who more Obnoxious to the Sting of Satyr? Who of all Men more pester'd with Ill Nature? Who at Plays sooner, and at Churches later? If this is Wit, e'er such a Wit to be, Who wou'd not, if 'twere possible, be more a Fool than Thee? Content's a Blessing; but it must be own'd It is a Blessing very rarely found: Some to the Men of Land believe it sent; But there's no being Rich and Innocent. As little can we place it with the Poor; It loves Enough, but neither Less, or More. Nor is it by the Rural Hind embrac'd; He sees it, but he han't the Sense to tast. Nor can it to the Trading Cit belong; It flies a Lying Lip, and Envious Tongue. Less can it to the Inns of Court be known; For Villany and That can ne'er be one. Nor will it in the Chase of Fame appear, For Greatest Honours are the least Sincere. Nor to the Am'rous Coxcomb will it come; It never stays but where the Heart's at Home. If with the Wedded 'tis presum'd to dwell, We may, alike, suppose it next in Hell. In short, the Rich, the Poor, the Peasant, Cit, Still aim at something which they have not yet, And still at something more if that should hit: 'Tis hard, perhaps impossible to find One that has all things suited to his Mind; Something will be amiss, and must be so, For to want Nothing, wou'd be Heav'n below: Yet some will think t'attain it here, and some In search of it, around the Globe will roam; Alas! it may be sooner found at Home: She lives not in the Court, or Noisy Town, But shuns the Gilded-Roofs, and Beds of Down, And Robes of Ermin, which in vain wou'd hide Their Owners Spite, Extortion, Lust and Pride: Of all the Sorts with which the Time's accurst, A Legislative Villain is the worst. In short, we'll all to this Conclusion bring, If not with Thee, there is not such a thing: For true Content, impartially defin'd, (And in thy Breast we see the Blessings join'd) Is Perfect Innocence, and Lasting Peace of Mind. How much, alas! of our short Time we waste, In seeking what we never get at last, The true Religion? Or, at least, so get, As to live up to the strict Rules of it: But one Foundation does our Saviour yeild, But Ah! how many Pinacles we build? Some guided by false Pastors go astray; Blinded are such, or will not see their Way, Others need not be driven on the Shelves; Foes to the Compass, they will wreck themselves. Some will have the Unfailing Chair their Guide, When any Chair would do as well beside; And some the Private Spirit—which is Pride. Tomes of Dispute around the World are spread, Perversely Writ, and as Perversely Read: With Prejudice and Spite the Volume swells, And (which the Present Christian Temper tells) The more the Virulence, the more it Sells. But after all their Shifts from this to that, Their Unintelligible, endless Chat, Nor we, nor they can tell what 'tis they wou'd be at. While thus their different Tenents they maintain, The Atheist tells you all Religion's vain, A Pious Usage, Ripen'd into Law, To sham the Crowd, and keep Mankind in awe. Indeed some Preach for Praise, and some for Gain, And some delight in Notions dull and vain, And some in Texts abstruse, which Angels can't explain. Witness the Feud that S?h and S?k penn'd; What neither understood they yet would both defend. 'Tis not for Age it self, much more for Youth, From so much Chaff to sift the Sacred Truth. Thus while we in an Anxious Laby'rinth stray, Without a Clue, and doubtful of the Way, Giddy with turning round, we fall to Death a Prey; Away w'are hurry'd, all our Life's a Dream, Or slept away, or spent in the Extreme. Thou art, dear Jack, from this hard Fate exempt, 'Tis Thou deserv'st Applause, and these Contempt; This Jargon thou not mark'st, or dost not know, Thou without this dost mount, with this we sink below. The Epicureans cou'd not feign their Gods More blest than Thee; for in their bright Abodes, At full Fruition of themselves, they lay, And made Eternity one Sportive Day: Careless of all our Petty Jars on Earth, Which they not minded, or but made their Mirth. So Thou, in thy Exalted Station plac'd, Enjoy'st the Present Minute e'er it wast, Thoughtless of all to come, forgetting all that's Past. Tell me, thou Man of Knowledge, who hast read What Cicero, Plato, Socrates have said, With all the Labours of the Mighty Dead; Inform me, when the Fatal Hour comes on, And the last Sands are hast'ning to be gone, What Signifies your Wisdom? do you know What the Soul is? or whether 'tis to go? Are not your Minds with sad Distractions fraught? Are You not lost in the Abyss of Thought! But, which is meaner still, can Human Wit, Call all in Pulpits taught, in Authors Writ, Make You contentedly Resign your Breath, And free You from the slavish Fears of Death? An Insects Chatt'ring, or a Dog that howls, Your Merry Crickets, and your Midnight Owls, Makes You Imagin Heav'n has seal'd your Doom, And summons You to your Eternal Home: On ev'ry Thought the Spleen strict Watch does keep, Till ye at last ev'n dread the Remedy of Sleep. Tell me, deny th'Assertion, if you can, Is not my Natural Fool the Happier Man? Remorse he feels not, which the Best must do, Or never reach the Bliss which they pursue: And if the Vertu'ous no way else can find But thro' a Pious Sorrow Peace of Mind; What Tortures must the Ungodly Wretch attend, That Sins as if his Life wou'd never end? What Stings and Gripes of Anguish must he feel! What Racks of Horror! and what Whips of Steel! When Conscience, as it first or last will do, Sets all his black Enormities in view; His Pride, Revenges, Perjuries, Breach of Trust, Prophaneness, Luxu'ry, Murder, Rage, and Lust: In vain no Faith he'd to Hereafter give, He here Anticipates his Doom, and feels a Hell alive. Mean while, my Pavy, thy Auspicious Breast Is with a Sacred Calm of Peace possest; That wings Thee smoothly on to everlasting Rest. No noisy Storms of Nature on the Deep Break thy Repose, which the same State does keep Alike if Winds be still, or if they blow, And shatter all above, and loosen all below. No Clangor frightens Thee, or beat of Drum, Or Visions of the Dismal Day of Doom, When, trembling, some awake and cry, 'tis come! 'tis come! With rowling Haggard Eyes they gaze around, And think they hear the last loud Trumpet sound: Nor only that, but Labouring with short Breath, Believe they're plunging down the horrid steep of Death: By their Intempe'rance to the Snare betray'd, When Indigested Fumes the Seat of Sense invade; And sad Ideas to the Soul instill Of Hissing Fiends, and Fears of Future Ill. Thou dost not with this Sensual Race comply, Nor in this worse than slavish Posture lye, Almost ev'n quitting Life for very fear to Die. Free from these frightful Apprehensions found, Thy Peace is lasting, and thy Rest is sound. But above all, had You the Sense assign'd To take a thoughtful view of Humankind: Were you to walk some Days thro' Cornwall street, And nicely mark the Num'rous Herd You'd meet: Some creep like Snails, and some like Monkeys walk, Some all hum-drum, and some Eternal Talk: Some clad in Silks, some wrap't in Double Frieze, And some with Rolls like Cables on their Knees. As Chatt'ring Babell did all Tongues confess, Yet not one know what t'other did express, You'd see the same Confusion there in Dress: No two alike of all the Endless Train, No two alike, yet all Profusely vain. And first the Ladies, with their high heel'd Shoos, Walk as their Hips were fastn'd on with Screws. All bare their Breasts, as if for Sale design'd, Six Ells of Lappet waving in the Wind, And half a Mercer's Shop tuck'd up behind: Their Monumental Heads to Heaven aspire; Ah! wou'd they take the Hint from their Attire! But they're so pleas'd on Earth they're not for Climbing high'r. Just after 'em the Fashion-Monger, Male, Obsequious waits, and posted at the Tail; Much worse, if Possible, and more by far Fond of his Trappings than the Ladies are; Exactly looking, cover'd with his Hair, Like Orson that was suckl'd by the Bear: Forgetting, as in Slovens, so no less Is Decency destroy'd by the Excess. Or were you in the Publick Walks to see Some labour'd Scenes of Hip-Civility; When first they meet how low our Beaus will bend, You'd think they stood at once on either End: Then how they toss their Noddles when they rise, To shake the Hair and Powder from their Eyes. Others will hug, and close as Lovers Kiss, Yet when they're parted all is Scorn and Hiss: To such Extremes is Modern Breeding grown, Present, y'ave all; and when y'are Absent, none: A Thousand Vows of Friendship tho' they swore, Not one of 'em is ever thought on more. So little can we in our Gentry see That Vulgar Vertue of Sincerity. Or were you in our Theatres to sit, And hear the Fools clap Bombast off for Wit, Farce for true Comedy; and the Good Sense That Manly speaks, run down for Impudence. Were you behind the Gawdy Scenes to go, (For Wit is only now Machine and Show) There view the Fops to Leonora bending, Like Twenty fawning Spaniels on one Ritch attending. Or shou'd you there a Base-born Mimick see, Hugg'd and Ador'd by Coxcombs of Degree, With only a deliberate Impudence To recommend him for a Man of Sense; Observe his Haughty Port, and Tow'ring Looks, That in a Bulk sat lately Chaffering Books; Or see him swell'd with his ill-gotten Pelf, Scorn Persons vastly better than himself; How big he looks when any Generous Pen Describes how much he's loath'd by Honest Men; But vain's his Anger, impotent his Rage; His Valour all is shown upon the Stage; His Tongue is sharp, and in Abuse delights, But blunt must be the Sword with which he fights. Or were you, next, to see the Midnight Rout In all their Curs'd Employments scour about; Some for Revenge, and some for Thievery prowl, And some in quest of Punks upon the Stroll: Were you to see 'em drink to an Excess, And ev'ry Glass advance in Wickedness, Till equally enflam'd with Wine and Drab, At last 'tis only Damn me, and a Stab; Nor Justice fear; now but the Murd'rer's Scoff, Assur'd a Jury Brib'd will bring 'em off: When any Tryal does for Blood befal, Their God and Country they their Umpires call, When Twelve Corrupted Perjur'd Rogues are all. Or shou'd you, at your Leisure, take the Pains To visit all the Pris'ners in their Chains; What Wretches doom'd to Durance wou'd you find? For various Crimes to various Wards assign'd. Our many Bridewells we shall mention, first, With Hemp and Hunger equally accurst; Where, of all Human Privilege debarr'd, The Vagrant and the Harlot labour hard, And thrice a Day are Lash'd for their Reward. The vicious Bench we will the next survey, Where many Villains won't come out that may, And needier Knaves that wou'd are forc'd to stay. But most the Common-Side your Eye wou'd draw, Where fed with Basket Alms, and lodg'd on Straw, You see the Curse of Debt, and Cruelty of Law: Ev'n Transportation much a milder Doom Than perishing, unpittied, thus at home. Nor can you unconcern'd thro' Ludgate pass Without a Conscience steel'd, or Heart of Brass; Where, thro' the Iron Grate, a Rueful Tongue Directs you to the Box below 'em hung, To angle Farthings from the num'rous Throng; But so successless, for one Giver found, Ten thousand shove along and never hear the Sound. But highest, Newgate your Concern wou'd rear, To see 'em Batt'ning in their Dung, and hear An Everlasting Clank of Irons there: A Nest of Villains, resolutely blind, That neither Present, Past or Future mind; But to the utmost Verge of Fate pursue An impious Life, nor their Condition rue, When Tyburn and Damnation's full in view: No least Contrition in their Eyes is seen, But all is Brass without, and hardned Fiend within. Just so did W? make Gen'rous E?rt bleed, Lost to remorse, and laughing at the Deed; But tho' a Pardon then deferr'd his Doom, Which way can he prevent the Hell to come. Or were you yet a blacker Scene to draw, And fairly open all th'Abuse of Law; Where you will find more Falsehood, Fraud, Design, Than is in all the Villains all our Jayls confine: No Cause with them is better, or is worse, But as it takes its Measure from the Purse. Those that have scap'd both Famine, Fire, and War, Have perish'd by the Harpies of the Bar: Their large Extended Tallons proudly stretch Where no Pursuit, no Judgment else can reach. Or were You of th'Exchange to take a View, No matter whether 'twere the Old or New; And for a while incline a List'ning Ear To all the fulsome Language vended there; What solemn Vows are cheaply thrown away, The work of ev'ry Hour in ev'ry Day, Without one serious Thought of what they say; How very hard they at Damnation Strain And many times for scarce a Farthing's Gain; In spite of all the Lies besides You hear, You'd think their Father only Worship'd there. Or were You next to mount the Guard, and see Their several Classes of Impiety; The Officers at Dice Blaspheming here, The Foot with Candles Sketching Lewdness there: But most the Horse You wou'd for Vice admire, At once all Swearing as at once they Fire: As in some Kitchen You perhaps have seen The Larding stuck so thick no Flesh appear'd between, So take from their Discourse the Oaths away, And You'll Retrench Nine Tenths of all they say. But at the Sutlers who their talk can tell! Where ev'ry Night they ev'n themselves excell, And breath with Brandy-Lungs the very Air of Hell. Or were you at the Court some Days t'attend To raise your Self, or Benefit your Friend, Shou'd you observe the Honest wait in vain, And hope Preferment none but Knaves attain, See Titles bought by Fops Unlearn'd and Base; But Honour is as hard to get as Grace; For that's not so deriv'd from Sire to Son, Much more by Whores obtain'd, or Flatt'ry won: Shew me the Man (for which the Times be prais'd) Who by his own Intrinsick Worth was rais'd Made often for no other Reason Great, But to Secure their Votes, or serve a Turn of State: The Run of ev'ry Dy the Courtiers know, Or Worth might once Expect a Lucky Throw; But on the truely Brave no Chance will fall, For Merit's Nothing there where Money's all. Shou'd You see all this, Jack, and from Your Heart The Truth, and nothing but the Truth Impart, Wou'dst thou be any thing but what thou Art? Pleas'd with thy Fate, and faithful to our Rules, How wou'dst thou Pity all these Wiser Fools! The Knight, Sir Guy, who overcame an Host, Was not so dang'rous then, as now a Knight o'th' Post: With Thee his Perjur'd Affidavits fail; Nor can the Flatt'rers florid Cant prevail; Alike Destructive both to Friends and Foes, Eternal Troublers of the World's Repose. From Feastings too y'are free, and Serenade, By Gluttons these, and those by Coxcombs made; And being so, are free from Surfeits, Noise, Which none but Fops believe Substantial Joys: Free from the Watch-Man's Bill, and Bully's Stab, And the Embrace of many a Pocky Drab. Nor are You for Your Actions call'd t'Acccount, Or Liable for Words the Gallow-Tree to mount, Where many of our Wisest Men have Swung For want of the due Government of Tongue. From ev'ry Imposition thou art free; Ev'n Publick Taxes take no hold of Thee: Nor dost thou take from Brogues the Gallick tread, Or with the English pay Excise for wearing of a Head. How well are they then Guilty of our Scorn That say—'twere better You had ne'er been born? That look on Thee with a Contemptuous Eye, And Sneer and Grin when e'er thou passest by, As if you were Compos'd of Courser Clay; Or form'd by a less Skillful Hand than they: But 'tis not Thee, their Selves are rather sham'd; Why shou'd that Sacred Folly be defam'd By which we are secur'd from all the Ills I've nam'd? The Wiser Turks, when by kind Heav'n's Decree Nature produces such a Fool as Thee, Make Him their Care, and as a Saint adore; Their Mahomet himself has hardly more: Believing firmly they must serve and love The few, so highly favour'd from above, And fix, undaunted, careless of the Wiles Of Prince's Courts, and freed from Human Toils: While they, obnoxious to their Tyrants hate, Their Fears of Want, or Hopes of Growing Great, Are made the Prey, Revenge, and Sport of Fate. O let us then, like them, think Thee the same, As Worthy of the Strait Embrace of Fame, And to all Future Times transmit thy Glorious Name! Hail! Awful Fool, thou Mighty Ideot Hail! Thou Conq'rour! against whom nor Men, nor Hell prevail; But thy Impenetrable Brain t'oppose, And pale Affright disperses all thy Foes: What e'er his Holyness may Urge in Pride, While on the Necks of Monarch's He does ride, Thy Dulness is a far more Certain Guide: What e'er he boasts of an Unerring Sway, What e'er Monks teach or Hood wink'd Sectaries say, H'has no Pretence to Infallibility any other way. Of all the Truths the Wisest Man express'd, This Aphorism must be own'd the best, Much Wisdom is much Grief, and while we here This Pond'rous load of Flesh about us bear, He that Increases Knowledge but Increases Care. Which is the same as shou'd he rise again, And in these following Words the Text explain. I knew while Living all that Man below In all his height of Wit cou'd boast to know, All that our Mortal Fabrick can receive; More than e'er Heav'n before to Man did give: From the tall Cedars that on Mountains grow, Ev'n to the Humble Shrubs in Vales below, All Plants the Fertile Earth did e'er Produce; I knew their several Natures, and their Use: To that exalted Pitch my Knowledge flew, 'Twas ev'n unknown to me how much I knew; But having cast to what Account 'twill come, I find all Cyphers for the Total Sum: 'Tis nothing! nothing! all that we can here Attain with utmost Study, Search and Care, Is but to know, (and that ev'n hard to gain) Our Care is fruitless, and our Search is vain. Against proud Wisdom 'twere enough to say, It raises Doubts which it can never lay, And being Blind, presumes to shew the Way; Or if not wholly Blind, with Blinking Eyes Wou'd pry into Abstrusest Mysteries, And grasp Incomprehensibilities: Talks but at Random, varying to Extremes, Fond of wild Notions and fantastick Themes, More incoherent than a Madman's Dreams. Thus it betrays us to ten Thousand Ills, And Tyrant like, it tortures 'ere it kills. Want pinches; for while thus we Books adore, Our Cash grows less, and Prudence ne'er the more. Meagre and Wan they look, and sleepless Nights Is one of the moap'd Student's best Delights. Eternal Jangle! Who cou'd ever find Two, tho' of one Religion, of one Mind. Here One on his dear Labours casts a Smile; Another strait unravels all his Toil, And shews how Coarse the Grain, how Lean the Soil: Another does the same by him; a Fourth Proves all the Third has said, of neither Force or Worth. And thus the Game is play'd from Hand to Hand, And made a Medley none can understand. Wisdom's but trifling then, with Pride pursu'd; And Folly is the only Human Good. THE SKETCH, A SATYR. TO Sir James Long, Baronet. The First Part. Shou'd we believe there cou'd a Monster be Confirm'd at Heart there was no Deity, (Thô Epicurus, who did furthest go, Taught GOD, but careless of Affairs below;) We cannot yet this Impious Wretch suppose In scarce so Damnable a State as those Who a Supreme Eternal BEING own, But Live as if they did believe in None. This Blacker Sort of Atheist of the two, Is now the Draught intended for your View: Nor care we who it galls, or gives Offence, While we keep close to Honesty and Sense. The rugged Lines a Satyr's Pencil draws, Nor value Censure, or bespeak Applause: Boldly we, then, will at their Image strike, And tho' we take it Rough, we'll make it Like. Our Nobles first (for 'twill but Manners be To pay the Deference due to Quality) Them first we'll trace, who in all Crimes abound, And walk for once their horrid Circle round. Imagine, then, the Man we'd here display, Is once more favour'd with returning Day; Which tho' in Mercy sent to make him mend, He yet resolves flagitiously to spend. Tir'd with the Drab, in whose Lascivious Arms He pass'd the Night; and loathing now her Charms, To get her secret off is first his Care; And Curses next supply the Place of Prayer. The Contemplation that shou'd be employ'd For Life continu'd, and in Health enjoy'd, Is how again his Consort to deceive; Forgetting Adam had his Match in Eve: For let no Coxcomb think if Lewd he be, But Madam Spouse will take that Liberty; Meet fleshly Pleasure with as warm a Gust, And make Revenge the Season to her Lust. But now he rises with tumultuous Brains, Last Night's Debauch in his Wan Look remains, Shakes in his Nerves, and hisses in his Veins: Hence his Attendants all are fau'ty found, And with Eternal Dog saluted round; Breathing himself with Kick and Cuff the while, As others do with Tennis or the Foil: Then of 'em feigns a Thousand Lies and Jears, And so diverts his grinning Visiters; Men of like Sallow Hue and Ritt'ling Size, With no Pretence but laughing to be Wise; Forgetting it was ne'er recorded yet, Abusing Servants shew'd a Master's Wit. Ev'n to our Beasts w'are Mercy bid to show, And Balaam's Ass reprov'd the Angry Blow; That Nobler Creature, whom we here disgrace, Describing this Descendant of his Race: For Proof that less Sagaciously he hears, Nothing in Nature more does grate his Ears, Than to be minded of his own Affairs: Busi'ness if his, he mortally does hate, So leaves his Spouse to manage his Estate. Wo to the Subjects govern'd by the Sword, And Tenants, where the Lady is the Lord: Audacious! at the Helm she does appear, Racking the Needy without Shame or Fear Of Hell hereafter, or Dishonour here: Whole Families relentless are undone, That she may Splendidly Confound her Own. But there's no tracing thro' so vile a Life, Nor must I lose the Husband in the Wife. In Dressing next three Precious Hours are spent, Which just make up the Ladies Complement: Were you to see him shod, and shav'd and Wigg'd You'd Swear the Sover'eign might as soon be Rigg'd. And (did but ev'ry Man his Part perform) Need fewer Hands to wether out a Storm. Trick'd up at last, their Wretched Service done, His Slaves avoid, and leave the Fop alone: Where, fonder than the Self-enamor'd Ass, His full half-hour he does with Rapture pass, In Turns and Windings made before his Glass: Now back he on himself does Smiling leer, Now he bows low, as bending to the Fair; His Hat in Feathers hid, his Face Immers'd in Hair; Thro' which he ev'ry thing so darkly spies, He first must shake his Ears to find his Eyes: Safely he may th'adjusting Manage use, And toss a Head that has no Brains to lose: Before all soil'd with Snuff; with like Design, Behind He's puff'd and Powder'd to the Chine. So once a Lady, fond to be embrac'd, Left half her Face unpainted in her hast; And went abroad into the Envious Light With one Cheek Fillamort, and t'other White. And yet ev'n this Unlucky Curtezan Was much less fau'ty than our Female Man. No more we'll bring their Washes to our view, Our Fop that way is perfect Woman too; Does Patch and Paint, and like the Nicest Fair, Less fear Damnation than a hazy Air. No more their Triple Tow'rs shall be our Scorn, When for one Wigg by our Sir Courtly worn, A dozen Country Strammels must be shorn. In after Times with Horror be it read, The very Flou'r that's perfum'd for the Head Is half enough to make a Dearth of Bread. But now down Stairs the Hero whiffling runs, Where He's encounter'd with a Troop of Duns, Thro' whom Courageously he makes his Way, With many a bitter Curse instead of Pay; Wond'ring (as if his Peerage was unknown) That e'er such Rogues shou'd ask him for their Own. Mean while the Wretches Pocket up their Bills, Just like our Modern Leacher swallowing Pills, With Jaws distorted, and with Faces wry, And—Lord deliver us from Quality! This was (They cry) his own appointed Day The very Hour he set and Swore to pay His Honour pawn'd we shou'd no longer stay. Mistaken Men! who have no Eyes to see That Honour must be One with Honesty; As steadily endeavou'ring to encrease In War our Glory, and our Trade in Peace: Like Light'ning swift our Properties to save When Crowds wou'd Rule, or Lawless Pow'r enslave; And not, as now, it self the Fool and Knave. Who does descend to ev'ry mean Trapan So kindly as our Honourable Man? In all our Dealings sure to be deceiv'd His Peerage trusted, or his Word believ'd. He Swears, but lets his Oath regardless go As if it were the meanest Tye below. Not Samson from his Bands got easier free Than Conscience does, in such, from Equity. Not GOD himself his Blamsphemy does spare; Tho' he might meet ev'n with Conviction there For nothing, less than Infinite, such Insolence cou'd bear. With him the Holiest are the vilest Race, And Meekness only Sanctity of Face: Religion but the Polity of Law, To sham the Good, and keep the Bad in awe: The Gospel all a Cant; and Moses, too, The Ancient Cheat, as CHRIST has been the New. Thus deals the Sceptick his Prophaneness round; From Earth to Heav'n the Impi'ous Notes rebound, And frighted MERCY Sicken at the Sound! Mean while he Honour to the Sky extols, And leaves Religion for the Bait of Fools.— But let 'em both Impartially be shown: Religion an Omniscient GOD does own, But Honour—Modern Honour—says there's None. Religion at no smallest Thought connives Where Lust resides; but Honour forward drives, Promiscuously debauching Matrons, Maids and Wives. Religion Ven'erates ev'ry Worthy Name, And Honour has no Joy but to defame. Religion flies from Debt as if 'twere Sin, And Honour's never but when once 'tis in. Religion, tho' from Little, largely gives, And Honour Ruins more than That relieves. Religion to no Privilege aspires Of doing all a Lawless Will requires; Or takes a Monster, by Oppression rear'd; Call'd—Scandalum Magnatum for a Guard. In short, if there is less of Worth and Sense In such than others, how is there Pretence To Honour more?—if such a Conduct's Fame, Hewson himself had once a Noble Name. In vain their Idle Boasts of Indian Earth, Their Tinsel Trappings, and Superiour Birth, If Merit's wanting that shou'd make it shine, And Rapin only does support the Line. Ay—but a thousand Years (You'll say) are ran Since first his Noble Pedigree began: No more?—then that no least Advantage is, I'm of a Line more Ancient, so, than His. Nor does his vast Possessions clear the Case, The Cits are then the most Illustrious Race; A Hundred of 'em, pick'd and cull'd, wou'd buy More than the Treble Tale of Quality. Well—but his ANCESTORS in War have done Prodigious things, and endless Glory won. 'Tis rare indeed!—but where's the Five by Name Whose Great Fore-Fathers were such Sons of Fame? Some few we grant the British Annals shew, And Talbots Glory shall be ever New: His Gallick Victories nobly yet appear; But Ah! he fell and left his Genius there And we are now too like to see them Conq'rours Here. With Him we lost all we had there Acquir'd, And France reviv'd as soon as he Expir'd. First in the Roll of Peerage high he shines; And what e'er Muse a Deathless Name designs, Repeating his, may chase Oblivion from her Lines. Nor less Propitious Shrewsbury does appear, Nor moves he in a less Illustrious Sphere: A Torrent of Renown the Sire begun, And his Descendent keeps it rowling on: Alike his Breast a Generous Spirit warms, Alike he keeps us safe from Foreign harms; In Council This as great as That in Arms. But what were Nine tenth-Parts of all the rest Of Ancient Peerage, and produce the Best? Progenitors that never saw a Fight But rais'd, as now, like Mushrooms in a Night: That to our Bounds no least Enlargement made, But set aloft by Flatt'ry, Law, or Trade. Nay if our Rolls to Dignity are true, To Purchase it was then the Method too; So like the Ancient Honour's to the New. How many Thousands in Oblivion lye As undistinguish'd as the Vulgar Fry, Not in the least to following Ages known, Nor, but for their Debauches, to their Own? Alike, our Modern Lords, by Means and Ways Exactly Parallel, their Fame and Praise As carefully secure to After Days. Th'Encrease of 'em is now advanc'd so high, The Court, the Parks, the Plays in swarms they ply, A very Rabble of Nobility! Got to the top of Pow'r by Guilt and Crimes Unknown to Minions of the former Times. (For Justice to Antiquity be done, Of all the Ways to rise we find not Pimping one; Or that the Barons, for precarious Pay, Turn'd Advocates for Arbitrary Sway.) Deduc'd from former Times, 'tis scarce a blame T'express a Defe'rence to an Ancient Name There's sometimes an Implicit Faith in Fame: But to this Rout what Rever'ence can belong? Plebeian witted, and Plebeian sprung: A Subject that does make ev'n Dulness keen, The Rabble's Laughter, and the Satyr's Grin. Desertless Dignity we all reject, Nor can the Mind be forc'd into Respect. A Country Spaniard, with upright Design, Did use to Offer at Saint Nichola's Shrine: The hearty Vot'ary never miss'd a Day T'invoke the Image, and to Praise, or Pray: The Priest he honour'd (as is there the Rule) With all the ardor of a finish'd Fool; But in Process of Time, it came to pass The second self of good Saint Nicholas By chance was broken, or with Age decay'd, And of the poor Man's Plumb-Tree a new Image made. But never after was he seen t'adore, Or pay the least Devotion, as before. Complain'd of to the Priest his want of Grace, Thus Honestly he pleaded to the Case. As for th'Old Image, Sacred long to Fame, I knew not what it was, or whence it came: My Adoration there my Conscience bid, I thought it just to do as others did; And meant sincerely while the Fraud was hid. But, for my Heart, I cannot worship this, Because I know 'tis only but a Piece Of my own Plumb-Tree;—a Descent but bad, What e'er Original the other had. In short, set by some few Superi'our Men That I'll not Name,—nor can I name You Ten, What Work is there a foot for an Historian's Pen? What is there but their Vanities and Crimes To be deliver'd down to Future Times? Ev'n Gaveston, methinks, this Ditty sings, Which Haughtier Buckingham yet lower brings; What Monsters are we Favorites of Kings? The Man of Title not sincerely Good, Is but th'Attaintor of Illustri'ous Blood; So much its nobler for a Fool to get A Man of Courage, Honesty and Wit, Than 'tis for Hero's to begin a Race, Their Founder's shame, and known to their Disgrace. But granting to 'em all they can pretend, Or hope to have; that we must humbly bend And lick the Dust before 'em, to a Name At best reflected from their Father's Fame; That tho' the Substance long ago is fled, The Shadow now must govern in its stead: Insist on such a Distance ne'er so long, No Privilege can justifie a Wrong. Not Guillim can with all his Colours save Th'unhonest P?r from being thought a Knave, And blaz'd abroad by an Impartial Pen; How e'er their Pow'r may awe precari'ous Men. In vain You urge, Prescriptions on their Side. That Veil's to thin the specio'us Fraud to hide: In our own Constitution we may see That wrong in Law, that's right in Equity, Be on their Side, then, Laws perverted Pow'rs, 'Tis more to us w'ave Truth and Sense on Ours.— Thus from the Ass the Lion's Trapping torn, And leaving Honour to the Publick Scorn, We'll back to it's Practitioner return. Who by this time, in private Hackney Coach'd, Has reach'd the Lodgings of his last Debauch'd.— O Fruitful Theme! and when shall I have done If one Digression calls another on? For here, my Muse, with fresh Recruits of Rage, Lance deep a Vice that half confounds the Age: Tho' most it reigns among the Great and Fair, Give it no Quarter, but ev'n stab it there; When Beauty errs we must not Beauty spare. Curse Women first that Wit and Merit flee, And rather than be Wives of low degree, Will lower fall, and Whore with Quality. With Love o'ercome we something kind cou'd say, The Mold is soft, and Nature marks the way; But shew no Mercy where they're Punks for Pay: For Monarch's Drabs, degraded by their Lives, Are yet beneath the meanest Vertu'ous Wives. But more severely yet their Tempters curse, That strive to make a Race so wicked, worse. As who the Sinner to Repentance wins 'Tis said—shall hide a multitude of Sins; So splits our Fop on the reverted Shelf, And by seducing others damns himself. But let me not the Beaute'ous Sex debase, When there's so many merit endless Praise: Among 'em Modesty erects her Throne, Peace in their Eyes, and Sweetness all their own! Whatever Vertue here can make us be, In them we at its full Resplendence see. Cou'd but the Chast of either Sex be shown, (And we may nearly guess by what is known,) The odds wou'd soon be on their Side confess'd, And there worst Vertue far Surmount our best. But Ah! Perfection we in vain pursue! The Angels fell,—and so may Women too. This Maxim's by the Vitious Man maintain'd, Unless a Lucrece there's no Conquest gain'd; Vainly believing She'll be less unjust Than Common Traders in Promiscuous Lust. Fool! not to know if once the Female fall, She thinks no more on what we Honour call; A Whore to One is next a Whore to All. But here, You'll say, the Censure bears too hard; A Vertuous Woman's constant to her Guard, And all Access, with such Intention, barr'd. True:—but with Billets first the Fair he plies, And Ladies, if not blind, will use their Eyes. She reads, and reads; and, tho' 'tis all a Cheat, 'Tis something to be Courted by the Great. His next Efforts and interview to gain, And low beneath her Feet declare his Pain. A Thousand Oaths he Impiously lets fly, Then calls on Heav'n to Witness Perjury. But still She does resist his lewd intent Forwarn'd by many a dismal Precedent. With Songs he next a closer Siege does lay And there comes off, too, hopeless of the Day: But when the Chariot richly lin'd appears, New Harness, and a Brace of Flanders Mares, And shews her, she at Parks and Plays may vie With Strumpets of Superiour Dignity, She can no more resist; but takes the Bait, And turns a Whore to Equipage and State. Nor stops he here, but (easier far betray'd) As well the Wife seduces as the Maid. Warm from the Husband's Bed he does entice The Punk to rise, and season'd for the Vice: On to th'appointed Street she scours along; Or if by dire Mistake she take the wrong, Sagacious, when on Wickedness he's bent, He winds the Foot, and traces by the Scent, Return'd, her Husband (if she waking finds) With Lust she softens, and with fondness blinds; Th'Excuse is took; the Hony hides the Gall, And Children not his own are Heirs of all: Down the Transmitted wrong to Ages flows, The Right Descent still robbing as it goes: Till Providence, (as 'tis presum'd to do), Cut off the Surreptitious Race to re-instate the True. But now, too late, the Husband finds the Jilt; The Lewdness less and less conceals the Guilt: There's a Gradation in all Vices seen; She that Adultery blushing does begin, Will rise at last to Glory in the Sin. Hence Parting, Ponyards, Poiso'ning came in play, Pack'd from his Bed, or from the World away;— For She must go, if He design to stay. Nor does a better Fate remain in Store For the Young Nymph we mention'd just before. A while, perhaps the Gaudy Thing does range, Shine in the Ring and glare along the Change; Till for some fresher Fair away She's thrown, And to the Common Hackney Price brought down: Diseas'd, despis'd, deserted, and disgrac'd, And e'en Redu'd to ply the Streets at last, She to some Suburb Bawdy-House retires, Poxing and Pox'd, and in a Flux expires. Mean while her Parents quite dissolve to Tears, Robb'd of the Fruit of all their Cost and Cares: To Years of Mutual Mourning they resign, And all the Family in Concert joyn; The Young bewail her Fate, the Old at Fate repine! Nor can they reconcile with all their Sense, Such Usage with the Care of Providence. Ah Cruel Pow'rs! (methinks they Sighing say) Was she not train'd in ev'ry Vertuous Way? No Nicest Failing did escape our Sight, For ever on the Watch to keep her right And that She might not follow empty Lore, (For Precept bids Example keep before) We liv'd as we believ'd;—and cou'd we more! Is this the Promis'd Recompence of Heav'n For due Obedience to its Precepts giv'n! Is this the Fate that Continence must share! The meed of Vertue! and the end of Prayer! O Sight that we with Blood-shot Eyes Survey! O Blasted Promise of a shining Day! We pleas'd our Selves she'd lead a Vertuous Life, And make some Youth a dear and dutious Wife, Conveying to all future Ages down A Line of Worth, of Prudence and Renown; When now she will but Propagate Disgrace, A lewd Distemper, and a Bastard Race. 'Tis hard indeed! extremely hard to bear! And it is what we can't Account for Here. How e'er, thus far we may the Point debate, It argues strongly for a Future State; And that a Hand both Pow'rful and severe Will reach the Crimes that are Exempted here: There Mercy to the Tempted may be shown, But Tempters, who are Devils, can have None. Or if from Sorrow disengag'd and free You'd have Revenge, come on, and join with Me: Revenge is here a Vertue; all your Woe To Scorpions turn, and Sting 'em thro' and thro'. The sharpest Human Sufferings be his Fate That tempts a Virgin from her Vertu'ous State; That with deliberate Lust and Hellish Joy, Does Truth betray, and Chastity destroy. Let his own Daughters his Disgrace begin, And lay on him th'Affliction with the Sin. His eldest Son be Fool, or Coward made; His younger, Knaves of Law, or Slaves to Trade. Distraction, Hate, and fierce Domestick Strife Confound his Peace, and Plague him long with Life. And as the Wives of others he betray'd, Alike from His be still Reprisals made: First, let 'em separate eat, then separate lie; (For what can such a Husband signifie) Till all her Sense of Shame and Honour past, She come to separate Maintenance at last; And, by his own Example taught, prefer All Pimps to Him, as he all Punks to Her: Nor longer then converse with one by one, But ev'ry Act be cover'd by a Town. In Death let him of Future Bliss despair, At Death uncertain who begat his Heir, Page, Porter, Pugg, or Coachman for his Fare. 'Tis done!—I see, by a Prophetick sight, The Curses fix, as we have aim'd 'em, Right. Thro' all Posterity the Doom is past, No Whoring Lord shall have a Consort Chast. But (what e'er Privilege he else may find) Be sure to pay Adultery still in Kind. Not Israel's King this Destiny cou'd Guard; Such was his Crime, and such was his Reward. If so he suffer'd, and the Fau't but one, What may they fear by whom 'tis daily done!— Yet fearless our Adulterous Peer keeps on! Luxurious in his Lust, the daintiest Flesh He picks and culls, and ev'ry Meal has Fresh; As if, like Ven'son Women kept too long Wou'd hoary grow, and have a tang too strong. But notwithstanding all his Art and Care, His Fate is oft to deal in tainted Ware: Why should he Hummums, else, and Bagnio's need? And why so often Physick, Cup and Bleed? Why Salivate and Bath? (all over Pains, Now of his Shoulders, now his Shins complains) Were not his Bitches in his Bones and Veins? But now the Visit o'er, or Business feign'd, Dinner supplies the Vigour Lust has drain'd. And here, alas! a Graceless Scene appears, Our own, and not the Vice of former Years: The Poor Mechanick and Illiterate Clown, With Eyes erected, thankfully sit down; Tho' to so little that there's none to leave, They render Praise for what they're to receive. But our loose Libertine, our Modern Lord, Claps down, Audacious, to a loaded Board To all Variety that Man can Name Of Earth and Sea, Fish, Flesh, and Fowl of Game, Without a Thought from whence the Blessing came. In Ancient Times the Tables of the Great Were the best Schools of Vertue; for the Meat, 'Twas the most slender part of all the Treat: Moral Discourses with their Meals were joyn'd; They fed the Body, but did feast the Mind. Wit with their Wine they equally did prize; But then no loose or trifling Talk did rise, For He that will be Merry must be Wise. They never met, but, different from the Throng, Something was greatly Said, or greatly Sung, And Learning gave the Ply to ev'ry Tongue. Nothing was there advanc'd but things of Weight, Or of the Present, or the Future State, Love, Prescience, Will, Necessity and Fate. And tho' their Reason gave 'em dubious Light, They trim'd the Lamp, and kept the Goal in sight; Adorning still Instruction with Delight. But at his Lordship's Table you can hear Nothing but Rack and Murder to the Ear. Impiety at first begins the Game, And then a List of Sins without a Name. Now with some Beauteous Punk the Times beguil'd, Where Lust is Prais'd, and Mutual Love revil'd. Now at the Ministry his dirt he flings. Traducing States and Vilifying Kings. Now for a Common Wealth he'd all devour; And now, prefer'd, damns all but Lawless Pow'r. Now the whole Board at once invade your Ear, And more than Ten shall talk for Two that hear. A Serious look is deem'd a Monstrous Fault, And Modesty meer Costiveness of Thought. Religion, as they dress it, does appear A thing we neither ought to Love, or Fear; Only by Crowds with Adoration seen, Or Pious Cowards troubled with the Spleen. Mixt with this Chat, the Healths and Oaths go round As thick as Hail; and no Decrease is found Till Five a Clock does summon 'em away, To wait the Fool of Honour to the Play. His Conduct there 'tis needless to recite, Side-Box'd, and shown in all the Face of Light. A thousand Witnesses his Folly see; Fond to be known, tho' known for Infamy. And tho' of Woman late he had his fill, Exhausted quite, He's yet for Woman still. Time will, he thinks, recruit the Vigor gone, So he provides against the Hour comes on. O needless and Ridiculous Excess, To be bespoke for future Wickedness! What Creature ever heard his Conscience say, His Crimes were not Sufficient for the Day? No matter this;—th'Assignation's set, And he has pawn'd his very Soul to meet: Tho' he shou'd here stand Honour'd on Record, A very worthy and Illustrious Lord, If here (and only here) he broke his Word: But Fame, as Cray-fish walk, he backward seeks; Bad Vows he follows, and the Good he breaks. Mean while the Play he lets regardless pass Unless it shew some near resembling Ass How e'er the Wits at Fopington revile, He thinks him yet the Glory of the Isle Soft in his Mein, and melting in his Stile With secret Joy he sees him Court the Fair, And Smiles to find his Senseless Image there: Forgetting quite, the Poet only fits His Coxcomb out to entertain the Wits. Well may we doubt that Folly will endure Which daily being laught at cannot cure: Impenetrable to the Scoffs and Jears Of being Cast in Publick by his Peers. Thus resolute in Nonsense to abound, And with a Crew of Flatterers compass'd round, He to some Tavern from the Play retires; Where Bacchus does infuse his Nobler Fires, And hatter'd Venus for a while respires. By this time Midnight's come; and now the Board Is spread afresh for our Luxurious Lord: At usual Times his Hunger to allay He scorns at Heart; the nasty, Vulgar way! So in the Ev'ning Dines, and Sups at Break of Day. Preposterous Wretch! so tender of himself, Yet in the midst of Surfeits hopes for Health. For now the Glass must run a Brimming round, Till Rage arises, and their Reason's drown'd: So silly Flies their Danger make their Game, Spread their thin Wings and Plunge into the Flame: For Quarrels next, and Fighting come in Play; When our fierce Hero (who began the Fray) Is carry'd off, or from 'em private steals, Nor thinks his safety in his Sword, but Heels: Away he hies, and into Bed does get; Ev'n then a Coward when he's most a Wit. Mean while his Wretched Friends in Battle joyn, Till they're, at last, as deep in Blood as Wine. What difference is there, pray, between this bold Bad Liver, and Pacuvius of old? Who when h'had Whor'd, and Gormandiz'd and swill'd, Three times been empty'd, and had thrice been fill'd, Dead Drunk, in Publick still was born along, His Servants Singing this Triumphant Song; (As if the Abstemious only were deceiv'd) Hey! Io Pæan Boys! h'has liv'd! h'has liv'd! To Morrow Fortune may her Spite betray, A Sudden Fate may snatch his Life away, But He's beforehand! He has liv'd to Day! H'has liv'd indeed;—but a most fearful End Must soon such an Intemp'rate Beast attend. Yet these are they who Imitation claim, The Form by which we must our Converse Frame: Our Buttocks, jutting, must like theirs be hung, The Patterns of our Dress, and Standards of our Tongue. O Contradiction! Manners to profess Amidst their Brutal Riots, and Excess. I have no Patience but in Rage am lost When such of Breeding, Sense and Honour boast; When Heaven's a Witness Earth does not contain A thing beside so Wicked, and so vain. A Man of Breeding! let him mark that hears; Who had th'Advantage Pm?ke or his Bears? A Man of Sense! it overturns our Rules; Rid by his Drabs, and over-reach'd by Fools? A Man of Honour! more prepost'rous yet! And never feed the Poor, or pay a Debt? To all Remains of Grace extinguish'd quite; Truth his Contempt, and Falshood his Delight— Away with such a Monster from our Sight! The Earth ev'n groans beneath the Impious Freight! Ah! let it not the Signal longer wait, Nor Korah's better Tribe be single in their Fate. To Sum up all—what ever Fools have thought, Blood gives no Honour, nor can Fame be bought; The Fame I mean that does on Worth depend, Which must be still acquir'd, and can't descend. What e'er the Haughty urge for Birth and State, Only the truely Good are truely Great. Affluence of Fortune, and not Temp'rance there, Their Gifts are Cheats, and Tables but a Snare, Who wou'd for Riches, then, or Honours crave, That see 'em of their Master make a Slave? Expos'd by that, in broad apparent Light, To ev'ry Passion, ev'ry Appetite; Let it be Anger, Lucre, Lust or Pride, There's none dismiss'd without being Gratify'd. Not that 'tis want of Influence from above Which makes 'em from the Paths of Vertue rove, Or shuts their Eyes against a SAVIOUR's Love; Nor yet that Conscience is remiss to tell, By secret Checks, they are not doing well; They better know; are certain of the way; Yet knowing, err; and seeing, go astray. Thus tho' a GOD his Lordship don't disown, He lives as if there really were none. Thus far W'ave ventur'd to expose to shame The base Perverters of a Noble Name: But here we'll rest, some fresh Recruits to find, And suit our Colours to the Crimes behind: For what is drawn imploring no Excuse, And painting what's to come for Common Use. The Second Part. The bright Arch-Angel, chief of all that fell, Yet Great, and still maintains his Port in Hell) Lost not his Glory, and his Prime Degree, For want of Knowledge, but Humility: He first 'twas that did Politicks impart, And, Clipper-like, was Ruin'd by his Art. Achitophel, whose Name is famous yet, Lost not his Credit for defect of Wit; Had he been Loyal, he had long been Great. Nor are our Politicians far behind The Jew in Craft, and like Reward may find. Sometimes into a turn of State they wedge Themselves so close, they grind their Ax's Edge: As Bride-well Slaves, with many a weary Bang, Beat out that Hemp in which they after Hang. Sometimes like Squirrels, (by their Hunters vex'd), One Tree a felling, leap into the next; Making that way their Sanctuary good, Till not a Royal Oak is left to Grace the Wood. False to their Prince, but faithful to his Gold: No Revolution makes 'em quit that hold. Old Machiavel is always in their Eye, And Good King David's Politicks thrown by; After GOD's Heart was why his Pow'r was giv'n, Tyrants but by Permission hold of Heav'n; In Anger made, they but the Scepter bear To Scourge th'Inconstancy that plac'd it there. What e'er the Government, these Turn-Coats still, Like Æsops Fly, rise up with Fortunes Wheel. Their Labours are not to enlarge our Bounds, But how by Fraud to get th'Adjoyning Grounds, And lay 'em to their own: Unhappy Fate Is His, whose Vineyard bounds on their Estate: Like Jacks on Gudgeons, to the Prey they rowl, Swallow'd at once, and are digested whole. Deficient Funds so little are their Care, They're robb'd of many Thousands every Year; No Wonder that the Wretch'd Subject's bare. Why must the Caytiff (tho' we own him poor) A Beggar be that Strowls from Door to Door, And who of Subsidies their Master Cheat, Tho' gather'd just alike, be Props of State? Lewis himself shall o'er the Ocean reign, And Publick Glory's chang'd for Private Gain: As lately they were taught our shipping Trade, With leave to Build, that they might next Invade: Mean while our Monarchs were Supinely shown, (Devested both of Reason and Renown,) Sporting with Drabs and lolling on a Throne. Thus not a Common Wealth is the Contest Or, whether That or Monarchy is best, But what does most advance their Interest. So a late Politician, when that Trump Had won the Game, got nimbly on the Rump, And spurr'd it on, enamor'd of the Jest, Till Oliver himself bestrid the Beast. To a Protector then he tun'd his Tongue, And gently sooth'd the Brutal Herd a long. The Father lost, he sided with the Son; And for no Government when he was gone, Next, when he heard all Men do so beside, (And working lustily to save his Tyde) For a true King and Monarchy he cry'd. Then when wild Factions noisy Stream ran high, Heading their Chief, he did with that comply, And strove to lay the true Succession by. Yet all this while, blest with a Lucky Hit, Or whether 'twere his Fate, his Art, or Wit, Just like a Cat, he lighted on his Feet: And last ev'n Destiny it self did mock, And fairly dy'd without an Ax and Block. But tho' these Wretches more than others know, Sagacious in what Point the Wind will blow; Veering for Safety what e'er way it Veers, For he must find the Danger first that Steers, Yet since their Wealth, as we too sadly see, Derives it self from our Calamity; Since they do all that's in their Pow'r to prove Religion's not descended from above; That 'tis but what the State-Wrights did invent To blind us when they founded Government; And since (which is of all our Proofs the Chief) They've brought their Practice down to that Belief, We must conclude, what ever God they Own, They live as if there really were None. Some Men to Little are but bred, and so But Little can of God and Nature know: If these in Judgment Err, (as most we find,) Or darkly see (for Ignorance is blind,) They shou'd not in Religious Points be sham'd, Tho' plac'd awry, but Pity'd more than blam'd: Stubborn in Zeal and hurrying swift along The Uulgar run, and all their Notions wrong; Yet find out Heav'n, tho' seemingly astray They go, while Wiser Blockheads lose their Way. For when I see a Coxcomb bred with cost, And Languages and Learning makes his boast; That has twice Twenty Years been running thro' His Books, and talks as he all Nature knew; What e'er You offer He's for solving strait, As if he were the End of all debate, Th'unerring, and Decisive Voice of Fate: When such a One becomes a Fool in Chief, Doubtful of Truth, and Staggering in Belief; False to the Holy Faith he first imbib'd, By Atheists Courted, and by Popery brib'd; Tho' Ill the Church and distant from Applause, That hires a Turn-Coat to support her Cause, Who knows, by Consequence, the Ills h'has done, Knows that he goes, and long astray has gone, Yet like a Devil, stubbornly keeps on. When I see Christians take so large a Scope, The Jew, methinks, has much the livelier Hope. A Lutheran now, a Papist next, and then A Calvinist, and back to Rome agen: With Notions thus for ever on the Range, No Weather e'er did oftner Chop and Change. Nay, when they've all these Transformations past, They Madlier set up for themselves at last: By their own Standard they'll have Truth be try'd, The very utmost Stretch of Human Pride! And think ev'n Scripture an unsafer Guide: But thus to make a Godhead of their Own, (If I may Judge) is certainly all one As if they really believ'd in None. Some Seminaries of our Youth (if Fame May be at all believ'd) are much to blame: 'Tis there the Disputant acquires the Skill To make that seem a Good he knows an Ill. Reverse of Knowledge! O perverted Schools! Scarce London more renown'd for Knaves and Fools. How can there due Severity be shown To Youth, there Crimes exceeded by our Own? To Punish an Adulterer is but right, But shou'd he do't that is a Sodomite? A Vertuous Hand best Grafts the Temperate Fruit; For first Impressions take the deepest Root: Who ever saw (so soon will Vice instill) The Tutor bad, and not the Pupil Ill? For Youth, like Wax, (believing, fond and vain, Takes then the Print it does to Age retain, Lust, if 'tis Lust; and Pride, if Pride you grave Ev'n Plato bred to Law had been a Knave. Or Right or Wrong, there scarce is one but treads True to his ply,) as Education leads. Some with vain Theories amuse the Rout, And add more Knots to those they'd Ravel out: A Thousand Vari'ous Noti'ons they advance, The Dreams of Fools, and the Produce of Chance. Others, Demure, but lavish of their Ink, Whole Pages Scribble, for one Line they think: Mean while the Wits their Doubts and Scruples raise, Nor care who Profits, so they gain but Praise. Hence Scepticks some, and others Ideots grow; Those will know all, and these will nothing know. Thus Learning, tho' all Glaring to the View, Can be adapted Justly but to few: Like Wine, or like Prosperity it flies Up to the Brain, and all below defies; Reason and Truth disdaining for it's Guide, And Tyrant-like wou'd rule by Pow'r and Pride. The rest who to their senseless Pastimes cleave, And spare not Time such Airy Webs to weave, Are Likelier in the Peoples Crimes to share, Than truely to discharge the Past'ral Care; To which no Creature ought to make pretence, Not tinctur'd thro' with Honesty and Sense. So that, indeed, (and state the Matter fair,) There does but very little Hope appear Such Foppling Teachers, tho' a God they own, Wou'd Live as if they did believe in One. But here, Methinks, they break into a Flame: How dare you, Slave, (they call me) Learning blame, The path to Vertue, and th'Ascent to Fame. I blame it not, I cry; of Heav'nly use If well apply'd, but Devilish in th'Abuse: For what has Arius and Socinus done To'ward the degrading of th'Eternal Son? His God-head not believ'd, on which depends The Christian Hope, the Christian Doctrin ends. To these we may their present Followers add, With all our Modern Sects both Moap'd and Mad. Tell me then you grave Masters of Debate, That Wire-draw, Doubt, Assert, Equivocate, With pleasing Sophistry misleading Youth, Adorning Falshood, and disguising Truth; While, with the Rents by Disputation made. The patching up Religion grows a Trade. Tell, when the Haughty Disputant's to show How he has laid out all his Time below, What will th'Impertinent and Senseless Tale Either the Writer or his Cause avail, To say 'twas spent in some Laborious Tome, Confuting Sectaries, and Confounding Rome? Or what the Roman Sophistry and Paint? With the more frightful Bulk of Baxtrian Cant? When it appears (more winding than a Maze) Instead of saving Souls, the Teachers Praise, They've fixt 'em in the Errors of their Ways; And made a Thousand Paths, when there's but one We ought to walk in, and no more to shun? There's nothing plainer both to Sense and Sight, Than that th'Exemplar Preacher need not Write: One single Instance of a Holy Life, Is of more Force than Endless Tomes of Strife: By that w'are taught, by that we Vertuous grow, For only He that's Good makes others so. On t'other side 'tis equally as clear Pen's loose Discourse and Lobb's Extempore Prayer (In Matters of more Moment unconcern'd) Is only to be Gifted thought, or Learn'd; A Pride of Spirit, Obstinately shown In crying down all Worship but their Own; To have vast Parties take from them their Name And so in Schism found a Devilish Fame. For Lucifer, who first at Truth did Strike, By Consequence was the first Schismatick. Hence ev'ry Centu'ry new Perswasions rise, Wolves, as we are forewarn'd, in Sheeps Disguise, Who making it their Gain to Disagree, Dissolve the Bands of Christian Unity: Vindictive, sullen, stupid, frontless grown The Scripture-Sense perverted to their Own, The tortur'd Bible on the Rack is Stretcht And wrested Texts for Proofs of Nonsense fetcht: Mean while the Crowd (in whom the Bane's instill'd) With Envy, Rage, and Cruelty are fill'd: That once incens'd ev'n Altars are not spar'd, Youth has no Pity, nor grey Hairs regard. In short all the Domestick Strife and Jar, Rape, Plunder, Murder, Fire and Massacre, Which the fresh bleeding Europe yet deplores, Must all be laid at their accursed Doors. How is our SAVIOUR's Meekness copy'd here? And the Reproaches he unmov'd did bear? Where is the Love he practis'd and enjoyn'd? Extensive as the Race of humankind! Thus tho' in their Disputes a GOD they own, 'Twere little odds (as the Event has shown) If really they had believ'd in None. Designing here to leave these Noble Piles, Methinks at parting the Physician Smiles: How can this Idle Satyrist, says he, At Scepticks rail, and blindly leave out Me? E'er since the Christian Faith possessed the Stage We have been thought the Pest of ev'ry Age. True, Doctor; you have prov'd your selves a more Flagitious Race than those that liv'd before: 'Tis but of later Date the Notion came That Atheist and Physician are the same. What ever Prejudice you foist between, The First is in the second Causes seen: The most pernicious Plant's of sov'reign Use, If well apply'd, and Wonders may produce. But think not ev'ry casual Cure that's done To Man occasion'd by your Skill alone; The Work of saving Lives is not your own. At best y'are but the Instruments to show How much for Health we to our Maker owe, And that, alas! but very seldom too: His Rods of Vengeance you are oft'ner found, To scourge the Earth, and deal his angry Vials round. Ev'n your whole College oft we baffl'd find, Prescriptions working contrary to kind. One dies to whose Recov'ry you wou'd swear; Another lives when you of Life despair: This shews you GOD his Pleasure does impart, And where he'll take, or spare, in vain your Art. Not but we grant to shew his Servant's Force, He lets the second Causes take their Course: But what Advantage can you thence pretend, So ignorant of their Natures and their End! Some few perhaps into your Knowledge fall, But what, that's finite, comprehends 'em all! Yet, wou'd you argue from the Truths you see, You least of all shou'd doubt a DEITY: You by Experience know (as David said) W'are fearfully, and wonderfully made! Can you, intent, on your Dissections look And not read GOD in that prodigious Book? Where ev'ry Fibre, Artery, Nerve and Vein, Shew by a strange Dependance on the Brain, No Chance cou'd link the admirable Chain! Who, after such a View, cou'd so forget Reason and Shame, as with Sarcastick Wit The Great Creator's Pow'r to disesteem, His Being question, and his Name blaspheme? Yet this you do; the Pow'r of Life and Death Mean while assuming, as you gave us Breath. Proof we might bring to bind what we attest, But let this Instance serve for all the rest. Some time ago (and much against his Will) A certain Knight fell violently ill: A dear old Friend, whose Residence was by, (One that Prescrib'd to his own Family, Nor wanted Skill) did Remedies apply: And still (the way a Christian Temper leans) What e'er he gave him cry'd God bless the Means. At last, not mending, the Physician's brought, Who chang'd the Phrase; and, when he gave him ought, Did worse than Mariners in Tempests swear— Here take it off, and, DAMN ME, never fear. In short what with his Potion and his Pill, The Doctor prov'd Successful in his Skill: And smiling on his Patient, told him, now You see the Proof, and will, I hope, allow Your Friends God Bless you frivolous and Poor, And that my Damn me did your Health Restore: No more believe that ought above you hears, When Oaths more efficacious are than Prayers. Thus, tho' he in his Heart a GOD must own, And trembling, Devil-like, acknowledge one, Yet, Devil-like, he lives as there indeed were none. But from these Private Murder'ers next we'll go To those that are by set Profession so: Where cutting Throats is purchasing a Name, To Ravish, Honour; and to Plunder, Fame: These three away the Life of War is gone, Ambition cou'd not do the Work alone; There must be Baits to drill the vulgar on. Ambition! the Reverse of ev'ry Good! The Blessings by it on the World bestow'd Invasion, Devastation, Rape and Blood. The Gallick Tyrants in this Roll the first, As well of Christians as of Princes worst; And here shall stand eternally accurst. What Glory can accrue to Treaties broke, Christians enslav'd, and Towns by Treach'ry took? Or if the doing this be real Fame, Who has gone further for a deathless Name? Defensive War is only lawful, all The rest we can but force and Robb'ry call: When you of War and hostile Rumor hear Implies the Christian warn'd from acting there. Good God! that Men who into Bodies get, Shou'd fly so far from Justice, Truth and Wit, To think it Glory when they Outrage do! Crimes they wou'd hang for, if they were but few. Suppose to Day two robb'd you, and no more, And you were robb'd to Morrow by a Score, Are not all Thieves?—supposing further yet, In some poor Village six that wanted Wit, And here a hundred thousand, more they're, true; Are not all Fools? the many like the few? Numbers no odds; did that from Censure save, What Man wou'd dare to call a Tradesman Knave? In brief, War's but th'Almighty's strecht-out Rod, The o'erflowing Vial of a jealous GOD, Who for our Lucre, Lust, Revenge and Pride, With all our Crimes and Villanies beside, Lets loose the Agents of his angry Will, And bids th'avenging Weapon take its Fill. In vain the Politician shews his Care, And thinks 'tis as he pleases Peace or War, A stronger Hand does move that vast Machine; The Statesman does, at best, but draw the Scene, And look the first; but equally is blind, Like us, to the revolving Turns behind, Did we alas! but one another Love We shou'd agree; the Sword wou'd soon remove; The Wars of Europe and of Asia cease, And all be lasting Universal Peace. A certain Proof that they who only Fight T'enlarge their Bounds, not valuing Wrong or Right, Are guilty Souls; yet they a GOD will own And sing his Praise for Neighb'ring States undone, Which is more mocking than believing One. To see in Camps how impiously they dwell, (As the Commander so the Centinel) To hear the Oaths they mouth, and Lies they vent, Poxt from the General's to the Suttler's Tent, You'd think Rome Chast, and Sodom Innocent. Well but, You'll say, that is no wonder here; They do but Fight, perhaps one Day a Year, So all the rest may Whore, and Drink, and Swear. But wou'd you think there can a Creature be Who breaths no other Air but Piety; That holier does Discourse than others Pray, Yet twenty times more Profligate than they. On thee, O Hypocrite! these Censures fall, Not only in one way a Knave, but all. Secret to Sin he moves like Eel's in Mud, Deceives Mankind, and palms the Cheat on GOD: With specious seeming polishes his Deeds, And let him deal with whom he will succeeds; The mimick Saint no other Voucher needs: We shun a Wolf, and we must know an Ape, But who suspects a Fraud in such a Shape? What a strange Sight must it hereafter be When GOD dismantles all Hypocrisie! 'Twill then with dismal Aggravations joyn'd, Be found that Man to Man ne'er speaks his Mind; That the Plain-Dealer's mov'd so far away, He's only to be met with in a Play! Husband to Wife, and Wife to Husband here Are fau'ty found, and Truth does ne'er appear; And to be plain, 'tis well it does not there: Marriage, as 'tis too often proves a Curse, Shou'd Truth be known, the Plague wou'd then be worse. Thus walks the Hypocrite in open Day, And unsurvey'd, does all the World survey: But does he walk, tho' he a GOD does own, And blames those Men that argue there is none, As if he did himself believe in One? Happy, you'll say, (since thus the most refin'd, The Great, as well as Learn'd of Humankind, To their own Lusts these Liberties allow;) Happy, you'll say, the Country Swains that Plough! The implicit Bumkins that in Gross believe, Whom arguing don't Corrupt or Doubt deceive. Astræa there, with Innocence adorn'd Does dwell, whose Absence is in Cities mourn'd. But tho' on Rural Shades so much you Doat, Live but among 'em and you'll change your Note; Nor barely fall of Expectation short, But meet ev'n equal Innocence at Court. Fool in Appearance, but in Dealing try His Wit, you'll find him Wary, Crafty, Sly, A thorow Knave, all Shift, and Cheat and Lye. Tho' six Days are allow'd him and his Beast To Work, he blends the Sabbath with the rest. The Publick Fasts are not at all his Care, So Covetous of Time he thinks it lost in Pray'r. As to no Men there longer Life is giv'n, So none spare less in the Pursuit of Heav'n: Stock still they stand, tho' they have Pow'r to go, Nor will pursue one useful thing they know: A Resty, Sullen, Brutal, Downward Race, And all for Gain;—the Antipodes to Grace. Tythe is a Plague he never can digest, A Duty that's the Bane of all the rest. When the Tenth Cock is took by the Divine, (Ungrateful for the Benefit of Nine!) Tho' they their Right from GOD's Appointment draw, He wonders who the Devil made the Law. As Seamen in a Storm will curse and swear, And likewise in a Calm for want of Air; So does this sordid Creature mouth and fret, The Season happ'ning over Dry, or Wet: At want of Rain repines; if much does fall, He thinks it, Deluge-like, will cover all: Almost believing HE but told a Tale That says, an Annual Harvest ne'er shall fail. Yet tho' he does in Health and Plenty live, Enjoying all a Peaceful Fate can give; Tho' he does Providence's Care behold, Th'Increase oft doubl'd on him Fifty-fold; When such a Harvest comes and crowds his Store, And calls aloud—be pitious of the Poor; Let some small Portion to the Needy fall A Little, for his Sake that gave you All: Ev'n then, tho' brib'd his Rigor to abate He Sells at an Unconscionable Rate; And Stingier growing for a Bounte'ous Year, Keeps up his Stock to make the Plenty dear. So close his Griping Temper to him cleaves, Gleaning himself, the Gleaners he deceives, And bans 'em if they look but on the Sheaves. 'Tis Strange they shou'd receive so bad a ply, And have the God-head always in their Eye; In ev'ry Change of Season he is shown:— Mean while they with the former Crew must own, They live as if they did believe in None. In short the Man that to himself propounds The thinking how the World with Vice abounds; How many Brutal Tempers He will see That have no Tincture of Humanity: How at their Betters constantly they rail, And in their close Revenges never fail; But load the Stranger, Poor and Innocent, With all the Envenom'd Terms they can invent, Minding no more the Blackning of a Name, Than Carted Bawds, or Female Players, shame. How ev'ry Great Man's Family (where Wealth Wine and high Feeding keep 'em rank in Health) Is an Establish'd Stews within it self. How Parents Impiously Correction spare, And in their Children's Hearing Curse and Swear; Bad always, but unpardonable there: And this ev'n from the Slave of low Degree, A General Evil up to Quality. How either Sex divert the Natu'ral Use A Thousand Vari'ous ways into Abuse; That ev'n in this Cold Clime old Sodom seems Reviv'd anew, and calls for hotter Flames. Add to all this the Envious and the Vain, Th'Ungratefull, Perjur'd, Treach'rous, and Profane The Publick Frauds, and Private Breach of Trust, Detraction, Murder, Robbery, Pride and Lust, With all th'Injustice to the Bar we draw, T'employ the Devilish Cormorants of Law. Did he but seriously on this Reflect, What cou'd he say? but that we all Reject Goodness alike, and tho' a GOD we own, We live as if there really were None. A Thousand other Crimes the Lash deserve; But for the Present this rude Sketch must serve: No further on the fainting Fury calls; My hand grows weary, and the Pencil falls— But while the Fau'ts of others I've Pourtray'd, And in their Native Colours Publick made, Too Partial to my own I've cast 'em in a Shade. Yes, Gracious GOD! who dost all Secrets view, I censure others, and am Guilty too; Both foolishly and wittingly offend, And still run on, as Life wou'd never end. But Arm, O Arm me with thy Heav'nly Grace, And such a Faith as Fortune can't efface. Tho' Vice is Prosp'rous, and the Vertuous, here, Seem of thy Gifts to have the Slende'rer share; In Worldly Trouble, and Corpor'eal Pain, Poor and despis'd, they all their Lives remain, While Wealth and Pleasure wait on the Prophane; Let me not doubt (tho' hid from Human Sight) But that a Time will come to do 'em Right: When Piety and Patience You'll repay With Glorious Crowns, and everlasting Day; And all thy Faithful, wrongfully Distrest, Advance into the Bosom of thy Rest. The Sceptick laughs, I grant, and does display His Wit, to hear me set so long a Day. Well, if it never come, the Answer's short; He'll not be there to make our Loss his Sport: But if it shou'd—He'll sadly be deceiv'd, And mourn in Hell the Heav'n he disbeliev'd. Ev'n tho' our Hope were vain, w'ave nought to fear Let then the Vertuous fix their Anchor there; And, Villany, take thou thy Portion here. Pindarick Poems. TO Fleetwood Sheppard Esq SIR, I need not here the servile Path pursue, By doing what most Dedicators do; Lay out their Patron's Vertues on a Stall, Like Pedlars Ware, to please the Crowd withall, And be despis'd by the Judicious Eye, Which does but look and loath, and pass regardless by. Your Merit speaks it self; a Poet's Care, In Lofty Praise, wou'd be superflu'ous there. What need that Man in a Fool's Coat be shown That has a Dress so graceful of his own? I wave that Subject then, your Gene'rous Mind, Wit, Judgment, Converse, and what else we find So lov'd, admir'd, and courted by Mankind; And humbly at your Feet this worthless Tribute lay: I owe you much, and blush I can so Little pay. I am, Sir, Your intirely devoted Servant, R. Gould. To the Society of the Beaux Esprits. ODE. I. If Poets when they undertake Some happy glorious Theme, That does their Hero's Worth Immortal make And settle in the foremost Rank of Fame; If they invoke some GOD to be Propitious, and infuse Life, Spirit, Warmth and Vigor in the Muse, Such as may Animate the whole Design, And shew they're guided by a Hand Divine; What Pow'r? What Deity (You learn'd Society) Must be invok'd by Me? 'Tis YOU, Great Souls, and only YOU Whose Fame I sing must aid me too: If you assist, the Work will shine With something Heav'nly ev'ry Line; But all must fail, if all be Mine. II. No tedious Ways Y'ave taken to your Fame, No vain Meanders trac'd, At something certain you direct your Aim; While those that obstinately go astray, And walk by Guess when there's a Beaten Way, Are but the more remarkably disgrac'd. So the dull Chymist with much Toil and Pain, And equal Loss of Time and Brain, Preposte'rously wears out his wretched Days In solid Vanity and empty Praise; And all to find (such Notions does he start) What neither is in Nature, or in Art. In vain they strive that pass-less Rock t'explore, Where they have seen so many split before, And lost on the inhospitable Shore; Castles erecting fondly in the Air; Rapt with the Bliss They shall possess In their new Golden Worlds—the Lord knows where! But after all, we see, (And they themselves at last as well as we) When their whole Lives are in expectance gone, (Betray'd by Hope, and led deluded on) Instead of the fam'd Stone, so much their Care, There's nothing left Existing but Despair, A Dismal Prospect of their Folly past, Their Treasure's vanish'd, and their Want's to last. III. When first you did your Forces joyn, When first you did your Mingl'd Lustre twine In that Bright Orb where now you shine, Making, in what you Spoke and Writ, A Perfect Galaxy of Wit, Stretch'd all across the Muses Skie, As truly Great, and as sublimely high: That you might still remain the same, And carry on a Deathless Name, You none among you wou'd admit, Tho' ne'er so Pow'rful, Rich, or Great, That set up Blasphemy for Wit. Nor those that with as small Excuse, Run into Bawdry and Abuse. Nor yet the Coxcombs who have no Pretence But Titles to be Men of Sense. No Scriblers, whose flagitious Rhimes Confirm the Vitious in their Crimes. No Fools enamour'd of their Lungs, With Souls transfus'd into their Songs: That gargling Revel-rout that Durf?y rules; The Captain-General of the Phyllis-Fools. To none Was the great Blessing shown But who brought equal Merit of their own; Such as were Worthy, and believ'd The Honour Worthy they receiv'd: That loath'd the crying Vices of the Age, And the loose Scenes of the declining Stage. IV. Thus Constituted you your Race began, And at the Goal already are arriv'd; Unlike the Greshamites, who slower run, And have their Fame surviv'd. Then, that you still may know Content, You give no sharp Invectives vent, Especially on Government: What e'er a Race of Male-Contents have writ, While on the Kingly Pow'r they Brooding sit, The Loyal Man is much the Nobler Wit. Nor do you take Delight to pry Into the Dark-wrought Snares of Policy; Made intricate by Juggling Elves, And often proves a Maze to lose themselves. Ne'er vex, or wonder at the prosp'rous Fate That does on Fools and Villains wait, And to the highest Grandeur raise; Where they like Mete'ors blaze, With all the lavish Poets wanton in their Praise: This stiles 'em Noble, and that calls 'em Just, And tells how well they have discharg'd their Trust; Tho' they rais'd all their Store By peeling of the Publick and the Poor; As by Estates, soon got, w'are sure they must: Gain, only Gain their whole Intent; Forgetting what the Scriptures teach, That He that's hasty to be Rich. Shall not be Innocent. Another does their Eloquence approve, As if their Tongues were tun'd above, And swears like Orpheus's Harp, they make the Forests move: Tho' to the Man that nicely marks, A Dog keeps more Coherence when he barks. Thus for a while they flourish—but anon Some sudden Storm of State comes pouring on; Nor will it give 'em time to breath: Seiz'd! Try'd! Convicted!—then they sadly see How much a guilty Wealth's beneath An Honest Poverty. V. Nor is your precious Time mispent In the vile Clamours of the Bar; Where the loud Tough-Lung'd Tribe, on Gain intent, Wage an Eternal War. The Cause now op'ning, either Side Draw up and for Defence provide: These first the Despe'rate Onset give, And those as Despe'rately receive. Mean while th'Auxiliary Band That the Defendant Chiefs Command, The Swiss that Swear on either Side for Pay, March boldly up and plunge into the Fray. And now the Plantiff Squadrons seem to yield, And wild Disorder covers all the Field: When, of a Sudden, Lo! the vanquish't War Rallies afresh, and threatens from afar: Their Hero's of the Post they now display, Which they behind had closely laid, For a Reserve, in Ambuscade, And by clear Dint of Perju'ry turn the Day. And now the Battle hangs in Even Scale, Nor those can Conquer, nor can these prevail. Mean while, upon this Poize of Fate, The Chiefs again renew the dire Debate, With Din enough to deafen Billinsgate. This is the Issue of a hungry Clown, And wore his Leathern Breeches up to Town. That has a Conscience steel'd, and this a Face Of right Corinthian Brass; And he that Brays so loudly is an Ass. But when the Pleading's at an End, They have no further to contend: Then all their Animosity and Strife Is how to make the Cause as long as Life; And, in large brimming Bowls, To quaff in Burgundy the Spoil of Fools. VI. O Madness! Madness to the last Excess! Nor can the Frenzy well be less, While thus w'are Goaded on to Wickedness: Envy and Hatred wou'd of Course expire, Were not the Lawyer by to feed the Fire. Their packing Juries too we can't forbear, The Harvest rises plente'ous there. Four Crops at least in the most Barren Year. By them in Trials w'are absolv'd, or doom'd, The Judge but as a Cypher stands; For tho' the Evidence be rightly sum'd, The main Decision falls of Course to other Hands. Ev'n in the best of Times we can't deny “The Jury passing on the Priso'ner's Life “In the sworn Twelve may have a Thief “Guiltier than him they try: But now the Lawyer does much deeper strike, And all th'Impannel'd List are Rogues alike: In vain they half are Challeng'd; still we find Tho' Bad's Excepted, worse is left behind. Break Houses up, let Blood be spilt, The Bribery will not find the Guilt. Buy an Estate without one Farthing's Aid, Owe Thousands to the Men of Trade, Th'Attorney palms the Jury—and 'tis paid. None better know the Law was meant Injustice to redress, To free the Poor and Innocent, And make Oppression less; None better know—but here's the Curse, No Men employ that Knowledge worse: Not Devils cloath'd in Flesh and Blood Cou'd more delight in Gain, or fly so fast from Good. How cou'd Gray's-Inn or how the Temple rise (Such Pompous Piles as e'en out-brave the Skies, And seem a Dwelling fit for Deities) If all the Cash that such a Charge sustain'd, Had only been by honest Pleading gain'd? As bad as now we count the Times, With all its Villanies and Crimes, Yet this in its Defence we have; That no Man ever saw A thorow, finish'd, Total Knave But what was bred to Law. VII. But as you justly fix your Hate Upon these Vermin of the State, That Ravage on the Spring just as they please, And leave the Barren After-Crop to other Sciences; So you as much the Fools expose (For they deserve the sharpest Scorn) That run by Choice into the Dang'rous Noose— But Asses are for Slav'ry born. The Needy from their Doors they chase As they were not of Human Race, Nor will from Thousands spare a Mite, Yet wast Estates to propagate their Spite: Will give a Million without Grutch, Just only for the bare Delight To make another Rascal spend as much: Not once conside'ring what will, last, befall, Or who stands waiting by to sweep up all. At the Groom-Porters, so, I've seen the Fops, Impatient for the Throw, Win their Three Hands and gladly pay Persisting in the flatte'ring Play, 'Till, between what was won and lost, Wise Neal has half the Cash engross'd: Still they push on, nor mind th'Impending Ill, The Purse will empty as the Box does fill. And so too have I read In Living Lines, tho' the fam'd Author's dead, The Frog and Mouse were once at Mortal Strife, And each in equal Hazard of his Life; The Kite, who from on high the Fewd did view, To shew how vainly Fools contend, Devour'd both Plaintiff and Defendant too; And brought the Senseless Quarrel to an End. VIII. Nor stop you here: the more flagitious Quack, That wears a Leash of Lives upon his Back, Feels your Resentment like the rest, For him a like Disdain express'd: Nor can his Blasphemy, or Wit, Preserve him from the Notion of a Cheat That grows by purging, and by poys'ning, Great. How very Negligent they are Too fatally we see; Nor need they make our Lives their Care, That both ways, live or die, will have their Fee. By Indirection thus they raise their Store, Keep Coaches, Lacquies; Drink, and Game, and Whore; And Quality it self can do no more. Religion either they detest, Or, which is equal, make a Jest; Ascaunce, like Fiends, they all its Precepts view; With the same Poison they their Spawn indue, And taint th'Apothecary too, With Lucre and Prophaneness thro 'and thro': Who close, like Leeches, to their Patients cleave, And with their damn'd unconscionable Bills No Cash to pay for future Illness leave; The Pounds just equal to the Tale of Pills. Thus Fool with Villains wilfully complying, Are made to pay ev'n for their Dying: Nay some have left 'em Legacies by Will, And ev'en in Death admir'd their Murde'rers Skill. IX. Unhappy foolish, wilful Man, Preposte'rous! from thy self thy Woes began. Of all Created Things none are so curst as Thee, So curst by an acquir'd Simplicity. The feather'd and four-footed Kind, Without those Helps we boast to find, Endure Heav'ns Wrath, Excessive Heat and Cold, Yet grow, according to their Natures old: Nor are among themselves at strife How to abridge the Little Span of Life; Which of it self, alas! is quickly gone, And flies too fast to be push'd faster on: But Man, vain Man has found a thousand Keys To open that one Lock that ends his Days: Or if Sword, Fire, the Plague, and Famine fail, They're not Physician Proof—he'll certainly prevail. O for a Western Wind that may To the Red Ocean, far away, These num'rous Locusts bear, A greater Curse than those of Egypt were; They but a while brought Desolation; But these are fix'd a standing Plague to scourge the sinful Nation. X. With these you equally despise The Sots that pore upon the Skies, Egregiously to Calculate The Good or Evil Fate Of Fools—and worse—of Women's Destinies. When such a One may 'scape be'ing hang'd, or drown'd, To which he's wickedly presum'd By Heav'nly Influence to be doom'd; And had th'untimely End without their warning found. When a lost Lover will again return, By Incantations read, and Sigils worn, And humbly at the Virgin's Feet his past Presumption mourn. If Marriage will disaste'rous grow, And sink into Domestick Jars; When the most common Fool may know, Without th'Assistance of the Stars, 'Twill certainly do so. When Comets hang aloft in Air, With swinging Tails and blazing Hair, To what Part of the threatn'd World The fatal Influ'ence will be hurl'd In Schism, Faction, Famine, Plague and War. When Moles appear upon the Skin, How all the Passions may, within, Be thro' the Sable Mirrours seen; Whether the Bearer's Prudent, Brave, or Just, The Friend of Bacchus, or the Child of Lust. What all our Senseless Dreams import, Drest in a Thousand various Shapes, Centaures, Chimæras, Bulls and Apes, When Fancy is dispos'd her Airyship to Sport. XI. Thus with their Aspects, Houses, Signs, And all that Ignorance with 'em joins To furnish out their Planetary Schemes, They run to more Ridiculous Extremes Than Poets, Fools, and Madmen in their Dreams. How can another's Fate be known By Him that's Igno'rant of his Own? Or how can he foresee th'Intrigues of Rome, Or which way France will play their Game, A Stranger to our Policy at Home?— If it of late deserves the Name. The wisest Man that ever was presumes That none can know the Future till it comes. To tell what Time will bring to Light How dare the rash Predicter boast, That can't retrieve, tho' ne'er so slight, One Thought that Memory has lost? The Stars, alas! but little show Of what will happen here below, And less the Gazers on 'em know. He only that can Vertu'ous be Best understands Futurity. What ever Fools believe, and Villains prate, We make, our selves, our Good or Evil Fate. XII. With these, in the same Wretched File, Our Vertuoso's take their Place; A Class of Men so vain and vile, They scarce deserve the Grace. Who is it can with Patience see Their Magazines of Trumpery? Which, if we may believe the Voice of Fame Wou'd take up a whole Century to name. Here one, that thinks he is no Ass, Does thro' his Magnifying Glass On some Minutest Insects pry With such a fix'd and heedful Eye As if the World were to be made anew, Or Heav'n it self depended on the View. Yet all the while shall have no other Aim Than just to see (O vain Design! And truly worthy of the Elves!) If any Vermin breed and feed on them, As Ticks on Horses, Dogs and Swine, And Lice upon themselves. Another does to Montpelier repair To bring home Bottl'd Air, Then generously uncorks it here; A Pint enough to purify a Shire. A Third will send for Water from the Rhine, Only to make comparison between The Thames and that, which of the Two's most light, And which will freeze the thickest in a Night. Others aver, the Mites in Cheese Live in a Monarchy like Bees; Have Civil Laws and Magistrates, Their Rise, Continuance, and their Fates, Like other Human Pow'rs and States; And, by a strange Peculiar Art, Can hear 'em Sneeze, Discourse and F?rt: These Men, by Right, shou'd be Astrologers, And hold Acquaintance with the Stars, Happy for doubting Man 'twou'd be; For they that have such Eyes, what is't they may not see! XIII. Nor is Philosophy exempt From Censure, not to say contempt: 'Tis true its Excellencies are Above all other Science far, That but a Gloe-worm, this a Star: And yet it does so many Errors share, As if they all at once existed there. How many vain Opinions have began, And been as vainly carried on By that most vain of all the Creatures, Man? All his Enquiries well express The best of 'em but speak by guess. Here one, the first and wisest, cou'd not see But that this All was from Eternity; And did on its own Principles depend As self existent, and wou'd never End, Another (as if rising from a Trance, And all the Atoms in their Antique Dance, Those Atoms which, all sorts of Union past, Leap'd into Form and made a World at last) Asserts 'twill perish, as it came by Chance. A third the Earth is fix't and all above, Sun, Moon, and Stars, for ever round it move: The Opponent brings it all in doubt And says the Earth is whirl'd about, By a Finger and a Thumb at first set up, And slept e'er since just like a School-boy's Top: While the Superiour Orbs of Light Stand gazing on, and wonder at the Sight. Some that the Moon's a World; and add withall This Globe on which we tread, this pond'rous Ball, Reflects a Light up to the Lunar Sphere, And is the very Luminary there, As that is with its borrow'd Glory here; Has just as many Times its Monthly range, Its Full and New; its Waxing, Wain and Change. XIV. Quite as ridiculous and vain Is all the Tenents they maintain Of what below they call our Final Good; And quite as little understood. In Beauty some have fixt the Name, And some in Pow'r, and some in Fame; In Riches some the flying Phantom place, And some in the Descent from Royal Race: Some in Ambition and in Battles won, In Cities sack'd, and Neighb'ring States undone; The way that now the Gallick Prince, thro' Blood And Ruin cuts to this Exalted Good: Whose ultimate Enjoyment is to be, By Persecution, Pride and Rage, The Curse and Horrour of the Age, And carry'd down accurs'd to all Posterity. Others, Voluptuously inclin'd, And making Pleasure all their Bent, Think it is only they can find This Golden Indies of Content: But ill indeed wou'd their Pretences bear, Tho' Man cou'd reach his summum Bonum here From one Debauch they to another roll, Infect the Body and untune the Soul, And all they can by Pleasure gain Is but more sharp Returns of Pain. Ev'n Death, the grisly Terrour they wou'd shun, In all their Bloom of Youth they hasten on, And lift, themselves, into his Ghastly Throne! XV. Thus Happiness does human Search beguile; In vain we strive the Plant to rear, And vainlier think it Fruit will bear; 'Tis not the Growth of the Terrestrial Soil. No more than Air it does its Form display, No more than Water in our Hold 'twill stay, But slips from the deluded grasp away. Not Vertue can it self this Proteus bind, That most of all things might expect it kind: 'Tis true it will have Peace within, The conscious Joy of flying Sin, A Pleasure Man, nor Devils can efface; But by Extortion, Envy, Pow'r or Pride, It shall be stript of all beside, Brought to the last Distress Of Wants, and ev'ry outward Wretchedness. The only Wonder is to see How it can yet contented be In all this World calls Infelicity. 'Twas ever and will ever be the Case Of worthiest Men to suffer by the Base: Nor can the Needy from the Wealthy have The Offal Crumbs to shield 'em from the Grave; So truly Dives lives in all his Race. XVI. Then for the SOUL, what that shou'd be How wildly do they disagree! So hard their Notion's to be solv'd, Or with so many Doubts involv'd, The more w' unravel w'are the less resolv'd. In vain we things, that Heav'n conceals wou'd view, In vain inextricable Paths pursue, Opinion is a Maze without a Clue. Some seat it in the Brain, from whence, They say it strangely does dispence Th'Intelligential Faculties to ev'ry distant Sense. Some think its Being in the Heart; And some that 'tis transfus'd, like Life thro' ev'ry Part. Some in the sanguin Tyde its Essence place, And roll it round with that the circling Race: Because the Generative Desire Does thence derive its quickning Fire, They poorly think the Soul's descent as base. Some backward look into the Wilds of Fate, And argue for its pre-existing State. Others assert from Man to Beast it flies, Confin'd to Earth, and never mounts the Skies. Some argue with the Flesh its Doom it takes, And sleeps till with the general Call it wakes. Some that immediately in Death it goes To its eternal Misery or Repose. Yet more abstrusely some Debate; And tell us in its sep'rate State 'Tis only the Remembrance there Of all our Thoughts and Actions here; A bare Existence of the Mind. When from the mortal Part disjoyn'd; That tho' the Body by dissolving gains An End of all its Joys and Pains, Th'immaterial Consciousness remains; And as it has on Earth been giv'n To Good or Ill, has thence its Hell or Heav'n. Thus level all our Rabbins in the Dark, Or if they hit—but vainly hit the Mark: For who can up to Heaven his Thoughts pursue? Or with Imagination go Into the gloomy Realms below, And in this Being, find his Notions true? From hence the Muse with conscious awe retires, And all she cannot comprehend, admires. XVII. Pardon me, gene'rous Souls, I have digress'd too long, But my Digression has not done you wrong; While I display the Follies you despise, Grown now to an enormous Size; While I the Lion's Skin displace, And shew behind the num'rous Race, For Laughter born, and Men to their Disgrace: (For to the everlasting Shame Of what Humanity we call, Like Homo, ASS is grown a common Name, And very nearly comprehends us all) While thus employ'd, th'impartial Few will guess By the degenerate Paths you shun In what a Noble Track you run, And by the Vice you hate the Vertues you possess. Your Vertues which by me, If you assist, shall be Deliver'd down to all Posteritie. Here therefore I again your Aid require, That with fresh Spirit you'd the Muse inspire, Nor cease, till she has fixt your Name Among the happiest Favourites of Fame; From her Records ne'er to be raz'd Till the loud Trumpet's general Blast, And Nature, Death and Time have breath'd their last. XVIII. First, your Religion shall be shown; Not such as Schismaticks wou'd pass for one, For theirs is—at the Bottom—none. As Lawyers long Disputes maintain For Honesty, without a Grain; Or as—Upon upon my Honour's—grown A certain Cue to shew there's none; So ruful Tones and wry Grimace Has still the least pretence to Grace, And is, at best, but Piety of Face. A Saviour in their Mouths they bear, But 'tis a Saviour only there; Their Souls, so much their Talk, the least of all their Care. When e'er Subversion of the State's design'd, Or Church, we always find The Schismatick and Atheist of a Mind; With Blood and Ruin carrying on the Work; Like the two Heathens now by Treaty Bound The Peace of Europe to Confound, The Turk more Christian, and the Christian Turk. No Tallies more exactly can agree Than open Vice and seeming Sanctity. From Interest Prejudice and Pride (Three rare Ingredients for a Guide) The Private Spirit Springs; The Atheist from the same Descent His Rancour, Hate and Evil-speaking brings Of Governour, and Government: This does a thousand Strifes create O'er true Religion to preside; And after Fleece the Flock 'twou'd guide; And 'tother but pulls down the State To share the Spoils, and on the Ruins ride. Thus Monarchies they Common-Wealths wou'd make, And Common-Wealths again for Gold forsake; Again another Rump they'd rear, Nay seat the Pope or Mufti there: Let 'em but have the God, their GAIN, They care not if the Devil reign. XIX. Mean while You your Perswasion show In wronging none by Word or Deed; In paying all Men what you owe, And giving Merit still it's Meed: Adhering fast to Scripture Rules, But not as they are taught by Fools; Who boasting true Illuminative Sight, Are lost in Darkness while they're bawling Light. Then for all Controversial Heat, You fly it as an Impi'ous Cheat: But chiefly those Debates that tend This Faith t'oppose, or that defend; For such can never have an End: With all th'Expence of Brain and Purse, W'are still but as we were,—or worse. The Fool Invincible I pass, Because he's not by Choice an Ass: But who cou'd ever yet convince With all the Force of Truth and Sense, A Man of Pen's perverting Craft, or Oates's Impudence? When e'er the Church our Pilot's left, We madly by our Passions steer, Of all the Means to make the Port bereft; For where's the way to Heav'n if 'tis not shown us there? This for our selves—but then the various Sects, Th'Excrescencies that out of Scripture grow, Think us th'abandon'd Race that Heav'n rejects, And they the Chosen Few. XX. And if such Men we wou'd confute, The way's to Practice, not Dispute: If still the Teacher's doing good, That Doctrine still is understood: By that he'll sooner gain his Cause. Than by a Thousand Penal Laws. Not only Truth does firmer grow By Pressure, but ev'n Errour too: If wildest Beasts by Soothing may be tam'd, The more provok'd they'll be the more enflam'd. What ever other Trophies Truth may boast: She in this War-fare still has lost: The clearest thread of Reaso'ning spun too fine, Does obviate oft it's own Design; And Wrong and Right, like East and West On Mathematick Globes exprest, But by a Point disjoyn. For tho' th'Advantage Error gets is small, Three Foils, the Wrestler says, is equal to a fall. 'Tis this that makes the Atheist sneer and laugh, And equally at all Religion Scoff: For How, alas! (too speciously they say) How can we choose but go astray, When, ev'n our Guides themselves take each a different way? And these damn those without Reprieve, For not believing what they can't believe? XXI. But, you Illustrious Souls, see this, See all, and know that all's amiss; And very wisely trace The moderate Path, and keep the moderate Pace; Not claiming Heav'n by Pride, or Passion, Or Works of Supererogation, As if there cou'd be Arrogance in Grace. If there's a Chosen Few Elected, we The Marks may of their Calling see Without their Holy Spite, and Tub-Barbarity. Thus cheerfully you travel on, Yet not so slow to Mire, Nor yet so fast to tire, And the Extremes that so divide us shun; Arriving (yet e'er Life is half declin'd) To what the Wise can only find, Habitual Innocence and lasting Peace of Mind. Mean while the Zealots, in their rash Career, Miss all they hope, and meet with all they fear: Nor can they less expect to feel, Drawn by the Steeds of Pride and Zeal, And Rage the Charioteer: Disdaining Reason and Controul, Lost and benighted, on they roll, As if 'twere only Madness sav'd the Soul. XXII. But above all you most detest The Men that wou'd our Holy Faith decry, And make it still their standing Jest To Ridicule all Christian Mystery. With them the Resurrection, Passion, Trinity, and Incarnation, Are but the Cobwebs of the Schools, The Gain of Knaves, and Dream of Fools; When at the self-same time the Senseless Elves Are quite thro'-out a Mystery to themselves. By what strange Magick does the outward SIGHT Amass together what it sees? And then, by a more strange Internal Light, Convey into the Mind the various Images? How does the TAST its Quality receive? Whence fetch its nice discerning Pow'r Of Salt and Fresh, and Sweet and Sour? How does the TOUCH such Transport give? That Lovers oft, but with a Chast Embrace, Believe they're of Ætherial Race, And feel a Joy that scarce will let 'em live! How thro' our EARS do Sounds our Cares controul? What Passage is there thence into the Soul? The Soul! that does so well agree With Musick, 'twill be once all Harmony! Here 'tis Immers'd in Flesh, and clogg'd with Breath; Ah happy! when let loose to fly To the Cœlestial Quire on high, And Life no more can be untun'd by Death! How on the SMELL do weak Effluviums strike? Where does that delicate Sensation live? Or whence the Notices derive T'approve, or to dislike? Feasting on ev'ry odorife'rous Breath, And flying noxious Fumes impregnated with Death. Thus tho' we by our REASON know We hear and tast and feel and smell and see, The wond'rous and unfathom'd HOW Is stilla Mystery! XXIII. A thousand other Instances there are Of Wonders we about us bear The Unbelieving to convince, But needless to enu'merate here, Convicted by our selves in ev'ry Sense. Then let us not our selves deceive, If we'll be blest we must believe. Nor is the Burden laid on us a Weight We have not Pow'r to bear; W'are only bid beside to be Sincere;— A perfect and unsinning State Is not Exacted, or Expected here. The Goal of Glory certainly he wins That does unfeignedly Repent, Believe a GOD, and own a SAVIOUR sent To save us from our Sins. Ah happy! truly happy Man That is as Vertuous as he can! A thousand Crimes will be renew'd Both in our Passions and Desires Ev'n while w'are striving to be Good; But let us neither Doubt or Fear; If all our whole Endeavour's there, 'Tis ALL that Heav'n requires. XXIV. But here th'Objection will be brought, What Man Endeavours as he ought? The Rules of Faith are own'd but few; But who does practically shew That from his Soul he thinks 'em true? If by our Lives our Faith is shown, The general Usage says there's none. Thus others we severely Doom, Regardless how it goes at Home. But let the Man that sees the Shelf Avoid the Splitting there himself. How e'er the general Stream does run, The publick Ills wou'd soon be done, If ev'ry Individual strove to better one. Unjustly he does blame the Times, That takes his Measures from his Crimes: Self Love must there be understood, Or an inveterate Will; The Vertuous hope that all are Good, The Vitious tell you all are Ill. Thus different Ways the Tempter does deceive; For some will regularly live, Yet w'on't our holy Faith believe: Others just oppositely fall, And think a true Belief is all. But what e'er System others frame, Shew by your Works the Faith that you profess, And by your Faith your Works of Blessedness, With you (Illustrious Souls!) are just the same: However Casuists turn the Clue, To give 'em both a different view, Where one is wanting 'tother's wanting too. A thousand other Points I might Set off here in their proper Light, Without the Guilt of Prejudice or Spite; But I refer 'em to the wrangling Men; Such Jargon wou'd Defile a Poets Pen, How can we hope their Feuds shou'd cease, That fetch a War ev'n from the Sourse of Peace? XXV. Nor do your Vertues, tho' they're great. Make you at all the Foes of Wit: Your Wit! that next does our Attendance claim; Like Proteus, with superiour Skill, A thousand Ways diversifying still, And ever still the same. Your Wit! that does deserve immortal Praise, A Wreath of Stars instead of Bays! Your Wit! which can at once Instruct and Please, And give the Vitious Patient timely Ease, Detect his specious Deeds and sensual Thoughts, And laugh him to a loathing of his Fau'ts. Your Wit! so charming, those that hear Cou'd wish they were all Ear; No sooner they admire, But some new Beauty lifts their Wonder higher. Not taken up on Trust, no plated Brass, But currant Coin that ev'ry where will pass: From painful Learning and Experience drain'd, And as with Labour got, so with Delight retain'd. Nor does it value Man the more For Dignity, for Pow'r or Place; Or save (tho' brib'd with half his Store) The sawcy Minion from Disgrace; Others unknowingly advance, And have at best, their Wit from Chance: Either to Vertue they're severe, Or him they ought to scorn, they fear: But all you write is all along, Like Samson's Riddle, sweet and strong, Harmonious to the Ear, and Hybla to the Tongue! XXVI. By this time we'll suppose you sit, The Gen'ral Good your full Design; Converting your unweary'd Wit, That ev'ry Nicest Blot can hit, Into a Flame divine. For in no beaten Path you tread, The Path of Humour or of Gain; But shew how far w'ave been misled Both by the Living and the Dead, And give to Truth the Honours of her Reign. Free us from Prejudice and Lyes, Nonsense, Impossibilities, And Wolves in Sheeps Disguise; With all the Snares that Earth and Hell have laid, By bringing our own Reason to our Aid: Our Reason, still in Danger try'd, And always prov'd a faithful Guide; Reason the Polar Star, That does discover Happiness from far: A Pilot that can thro' Life's Ocean steer As safe in Storms, as if the Skies were clear: While those who but by halves believe (Bred up for Blockheads to deceive) Are daily with a thousand Fears perplext, This Hour of one Perswasion, none the next. But Reason, drest in Adamantine Arms, Does end in frightful Charms; All subtil Shifts descry With its sharp sighted Eagles Eye, Before whose pow'rful Rays the gloomy Fantoms fly. XXVII. While thus you hold Discourse the Goblet's crown'd, And twice or thrice does nimbly move around: Care that Disturber of our Rest, That grows Habitual to the Breast, And hardly e'er is dispossest; Ev'n that curst Fiend at such a time takes Wing, And Envy quite forgets her Sting. Yet nothing idle or profane, Lewd, ridiculous, or vain, Nothing is spoke but what the Nuns might hear, Were they much chaster than they are. Thus Mirth you cloath in its true genuine Shape; Not like an Ass, an Owl, or Ape, But in the very Garb 'twas drest by BEN— There's the same Difference between Mirth as Men. And now you envy not ev'n Kings themselves, Nor all the under Fry of Courtly Elves; Who, like the Moon, their borrow'd Lustre owe, And Tradesmen are the Suns that make 'em glitter so. The Troubles of Mortality you view, Those num'rous, and its Comforts few; The Evil that o'er Mankind brooding lies, That tongues the Fool, and silencies the Wise; The Fears and Jealousies that sway the Rout, Cowards in Office, and the Brave without: And since true Pleasure flits and will not stay, You this way take a Draught without allay, And make the dull Fatigue of Life fly pleasantly away. XXVIII. What Honours then, you mighty few, Ought here to be conferr'd on you, That shew at once the Path to Peace and Pleasure too? What Trophies to your Fame must we erect? And O what Wonders may we not expect (Tho' distant far, and lying ne'er so wide) Brought home by Men so nobly qualify'd: That ev'n at your first setting out (like Flame Aspiring to the Starry Frame) To such a Pitch your Merit raise, As leaves behind our lagging Praise, And shews you knew no Nonage in your Fame. Ah! wou'd but one of you (whose Breast Is with the sacred Fire possest) But sing the Vertues of the rest, Something we then might hope to see Worthy the famous Beaux-Esprits, The Generous and August Society; August, I say, and dare the Name repeat, Since what is always Good is always Great. Where else, alas! can there be found A Sprat your Grandeur to resound? Where else a Cowley in his Lofty Verse Your Glories to rehearse, And to the Heav'nly Arch make the wide Echo bound? Your Glory which like the fix'd Star wou'd shine, And as Propitious be To all that want a Guide, as He, Had this Great Subject been adorn'd by any Muse but Mine. To my Lord of Abingdon. I. As when of old some Labou'ring Swain Was favour'd with a large Encrease of Grain, Strait to the Gods he sent his Prayer Thro' the obsequious Air, More swift than the wing'd Race themselves cou'd flee, For nothing is so swift as Piety: With no less Zeal, my Lord, to YOU My Praises I acknowledge due For all the Bounties you dispence, Almost with Universal Influence; An Influ'ence so diffus'd and free, (O Greatness without Pride!) it ev'n extends to me! Disdain not then that Praise, my Offering, to receive, 'Tis all, alas! the Muse can give; But then the World shall see I'll never cease to pay You that, till I shall cease to Be. II. Were I in Ricot's happy Shade, Where neither Strife or Envy come, Or meagre Care does e'er presume One Moment's soft Repose t'invade; But ev'ry Morning does fresh Plenty bring, And Plenty flows with an unbounded Spring: Where Horses Neighing, and the cheerful Sound Of Huntsman, Horn and Hound, Echo's a Grateful Harmony to all the Country round. Or when your Sportful Lavington we Name, The ever-smiling Scene is much the same: There only 'tis where Nature is with Art at Strife; Both are Ambitious to Excel, And both have done so well, That 'twou'd be hard to tell Which of 'em's most adorn'd with Beauty and with Life! Such Haunts as these might possibly inspire My Breast with a Poetick Fire, And set those Thoughts on Wing, Which now but faintly fly, and hoarsly sing. III. Long we might here upon the Mansions live, But something Nobler comes in view; The Hospitality within Does a new Flight begin, And claims at once our Praise and Wonder too. O Libe'ral Hand! and Libe'ral Heart! Not Heav'n can hardly freelier give, Nor he more willingly receive, Than he's dispos'd his Bounties to impart. Never was yet his Gener'ous Door, Or Coffers that contain'd his Store, Shut to his Friend, his Tenant, or the Poor, Ah! fix, my Muse, thy Labours here, Nor let Ignobler Trifles be thy Care: Upon this Theme thou may'st for ever dwell, And ev'ry Day have something new to tell: A Theme which had Great Pindar's Greater Son Been but so happy to have known; Thro' ev'ry Village 'twou'd have rung, The sole Delight of ev'ry Tongue; Thro' ev'ry Meadow, ev'ry Grove, Where Shepherds seal their Vows of Love; Nay, to the Clouds it Echoing wou'd have flown, And made (just to his Wish) all Future Time his own! No vulgar, nor no vain Esteem Cou'd wait a Blessing so extreme, Of such a Song! and such a Theme! IV. Nor had his Praise, nor had his Mind Been only to your Name confin'd: The God-like Lyndsey's Worth he wou'd have sung, That lasting Charm to ev'ry Loyal Tongue! He wou'd (inspir'd with the Heroick Thought) Have told how well he liv'd, and well he fought; How like a Bulwork by his Prince he stood, When 'twas found Treason to be Great, or Good: And spite of Death and Time's devouring Jaws, Have crown'd his Memory with deserv'd Applause; So Great the Warriour! and so just the Cause! Nor yet wou'd he ev'n there have staid, But further on Triumphant fled, And in Prophetick Verse display'd The Happy Issue of Your Bed: Never did yet in Spring appear A view of such a Plente'ous Year As Nature seems to Promise there! A diffe'rent way the diffe'rent Off-spring warms; And as the safest Guard from Human Harms, Those take the Father's Piety, and these the Mother's Charms: These when they come to Riper Years, The Warbling Lyre with Love will string; In those all we can Hope appears That may oblige, or serve their King. Where is there one of the Illustrious Blood Not born and fashion'd for his Country's Good. V. Nor had your Wisdom and your Piety Been pass'd neglected by; And least of all your steadfast Loyalty; Which stood the Pow'rful Factions late Impetu'ous Shock, Unshaken as a Rock. Upon smooth Seas we may with Safety steer, For there the Pleasure does surmount the Fear; But hard and dange'rous 'tis to gain the Port When Winds and Waves with equal Fury roar, And make those stately Barks their Cruel Sport They seem'd to Court before. Such is the Sea; nor was our Storm at Land, By yours and other Loyal Hands represt (But Yours more strenu'ous than the rest) Less danger'ous to withstand. All this and more we then had heard, In Numbers worthy of the Bard! And I! ev'n I! how pleas'd had I appear'd! If for the short Liv'd Praise I render here, I'd met it in Immortal Numbers there! Sacred to the Memory of our late Sovereign Lord King Charles the Second. I. Each Man has Private Cares enow To make him bend, to make him bow, Ah! how then shall we bear this General Burthen now! Unless we die with Grief, what Sorrows can we bring Sufficient for the Loss of such a Gracious King! Peace, like a Mountain Stream, from him did flow, And water'd all us Humble Plants below, And made us flourish too; Yet Peace himself but seldom knew. Ah wretched, and too rigid Fate That on Indulgent Monarchs wait! While for the Publick Good the Publick Weight they bear, As they're Supreme in Pow'r so they're supreme in Care: Theirs is the Trouble, theirs the Pain, And ours the Pleasure, ours the Gain; And this was prov'd in Charles's Reign. Think, Briton's, think how oft h'has broke his Sleep, Intrench'd on his few Hours of needful Rest To make us Free, to make us Blest, And if you are not Marble you must weep! II. Long as our stubborn Land he sway'd (Ah that w' had all so long obey'd!) Our stubborn Land a Paradise was made: Indulg'd by his Enliv'ning Smiles (The Envy of all other Isles) We did in Safety Ease and Plenty live, And had almost at once what Earth and Heav'n cou'd give: 'Till sated with continu'd Happiness, Like Devils we conspir'd to make it less; Afresh did Fears and Jealousies create, And once more strove to plunge the State In all the Miseries it felt from Forty One to Eight. Here did our Pitying Monarch timely interpose, And sav'd us from our selves—our most Invete'rate Foes. On those that Goodness cou'd not awe, He let loose Justice and the Law: His Justice prob'd our fester'd Wound, His Justice heal'd and made it sound, From Exile call'd our Banish'd Right, (Good Angels and Good Mens Delight) And made us happy in our own Despight! III. Not op'ning Buds more certain Tydings bring Of the approaching Glories of the Spring, Than his least Action spoke him KING! He talk't, he look't, he trod, And had the Air, the Port, and Meinage of a GOD! These Wonders in his Person all might find, But who can tell the Wonders of his Mind! How Wise! how Mild! how Merciful and Kind! In Exile, Danger, Want and Strife, And all the various Changes of his Life, Before, and when he Reign'd, His Troubles were with Saint-like Constancy sustain'd: And Great and Num'rous was the Store; His Martyr'd God and Martyr'd Father only suffer'd more. His Favours too, like theirs, did still Extend to all that meant him Ill: His deadliest Foes cou'd not so fast offend, Or more opprobrious Langu'age give Than he wou'd Patiently receive; Nay when at last he found they wou'd not mend, But either he or they must cease to Live, He griev'd the Law remov'd 'em from a Friend. What way can we such Clemency express!— O Patience! Goodness! Mercy to excess! IV. Ah Pity! (for they're, sure, of better Clay) That the Crown'd Head shou'd go the Vulgar Way! If ought that's Excellent, or Brave, Cou'd Privilege their Owners from the Grave, He, like Elijah, to his Bliss had fled, And never mingl'd with the Dead— But Man was born to Die! And tho' the Prophet, we must own Did much the easier Passage find, Our Pious Sovereign left his Dross behind, And mounted his Æthereal Throne More pure and more refin'd. There rest, blest Shade! from all the Sorrow free, From all the Treachery, From all the Infidelity, That did attend thy painful Progress of Mortality: There rest, blest Shade! for ever rest! Of all that Peace can give gossest! That Peace which here thou cou'd'st not gain, Tho' blessing us with the most Peaceful Reign That e'er the British Isle will see again: While the poor Melancholy Bards below (But not while THOU wert Living, so) Tho' they can ne'er pay all they owe, At least their Love and Duty show; And in sad Funeral-Verse embalm Their ever happy Patron's Name; Not that it needs it—for 'twou'd live Without th'Assistance Poets give. The Twelfth of June. I. Thou art return'd, Auspicious DAY! And with Thee brought along Of noble Thoughts a rich and num'rous Throng, To cloath the Muse in all her best Array, And upward to the Clouds direct her wondering Way. How many fatal Days in the Career But of one single Year, Give Birth to what we loath, or what we fear? Creatures of Nature's Rubbish made, Or Tyrants who all Right invade; Shepherds that undermine the Rock, And are themselves, at best, but Sheerers of their Flock. How many Men aspire to Rule Only by being Knave, or Fool? Nor care how low the Nation lies, So they may have a Time to rise? Or Fears, or Factions these create, Or those in murm'uring Senates sow Debate: Some all to Property wou'd give, And others to Prerogative, So bandy up and down the tottering State. As if th'old Wounds were only cur'd, That New, and worse might be endur'd. Some Days, 'tis true, we grant there are Befriended with a more Propitious Star, That darting home the Seeds of virtual Heat, Produces all the Good, and Brave, and Great. And such a Star did Influence the Morn, 'Twas such a Star that did adorn The Skie when ABINGDON was born, Endear'd him both to Heav'n and Men, And makes his Glories now as bright as That was then. II. ABINGDON!—the mighty Name Does from the Hills and Vallies round Reverberate with a stronger Bound, Than any other British Sound, And makes a fuller blast for the loud trump of Fame. Ev'n Envious Men, Sullen and Discontent, Thus far are forc't to give assent, That He's at once both Great and Innocent. His height don't make him look awry; The Error's only in the Eye, That's dazl'd when it looks so high. He shews what we can, else, but seldom see, That Quality and Vertue may agree, So long believ'd a Contrariety! In Wealth and Pow'r the Heart is truliest try'd; But Wealth and Power, nor ought beside, Cou'd make him e'er a Friend to Pride? A Vice with which we brand the Great, when most 'Tis by precarious Fools in Place engrost; Who rising from an obscure Stem, Think nothing shines so bright As they in their dimm borrow'd Light, Dull Pebbles when compar'd with the right orient Gem: Such as our Hero still has been, And such as still he's seen, A Galaxy of Glorious Deeds, Where Vertue, Vertue still succeeds, And not an Action base, or low, between. His Country's Peace is still his daily Care, His Thoughts and Actions all are Centr'd there: PEACE the most Bountiful of Things! While under her Prolifick Wings Plenty, Pow'r and Ease she brings, She Hatches more than Twenty Springs! Yet Peace tho' we so much adore, Shou'd we not give MIRANA more? Shou'd we not HER, yet higher raise? Who does affect our Souls by more Mysterious ways: For Peace, tho' white as Truth it be, Is not so white, so kind, so dear, or charms so sure as SHE! III. Such is the Consort of our Worthy-found, Equal for Form and Purity renown'd: Clasp'd in her soft, her Snowy Arm, He's in that Circle safe from harm, Beyond Ambition to allure, or Lawless Love to Charm. Where is the Poor to whom he will not lend? Where is the Good to whom He's not a Friend? Where is the Sick to whom he does not send? Or where's the Rich with whom he does Contend? Brave as the Hero's were of Old Of whom we Antique Stories hear, As fam'd, as fierce, as gene'rous, bold, And as exempt from Fear: They seve'n-fold Shields did o'er 'em throw, To break, or to Divert the Blow, But now it boots not to do so; Against the Thunde'ring Cannon what Defence But Truth, with her Attendant, Innocence? He both Possesses, both may call his Own, And to the World their Excellence makes known. When Factions rag'd; and Jesuits Tears Had sunk into Fanatick Ears And swell'd 'em to a Tympany with Jealousies and Fears; When Roman Wolves the Folds at large did range, And home-bred Bigots tugg'd and gap'd for Change; When Innovation, with no Guard between, Stood at the Door, and just was ent'ring in; He with his Ever-ready helping Hand, Did their united Rage withstand And ev'n almost alone half propt a sinking Land. IV. What Jolly Sounds are these we hear? That so harmoniously contend Which most shall Charm the Ear? Or did the Future Gene'ral Joy depend On the high Birth of this Illustrious PEER? It did:—for see! the Country round, On this Occasion ready found, Obsequiously are come to pay Their just Respects, and Celebrate the DAY. See in their Faces their Affections spread, And much is thought, tho' little said: But when the Hearts unable to display The Joy it feels, or Defer'ence it wou'd pay, Nature exerts her self a Kindlier way: For see! the shining Goblets all are crown'd And the great Health goes nimbly round: Wine does as free as Water flow, And does to none Distinction know, Dealt equally to High and Low: Wine that cheers the Heart and Brain, The Muses Innocent Delight, That sweetens her harmonious Strain, And higher wings her tow'ring Flight. Sill it goes round, and let it still, Let him not drink that does not fill, Disgrace and Want of Liquor be his Lot; Nor let Mirana's Health among you be forgot: Nor yet the happy Heir, The eldest Hope of the Illustrious Pair, He who already nobly seeks a Name, Reflects from what a high Descent he came, And strives as much to be the Theme of Fame: His Actions ev'n thus early brightly shine; Nor shall there want a Pen to set 'em forth, And be the Herald of his Worth, If he but condescend t'accept of Mine. V. But while the Guests thus freely pass the Day In Freedom, Peace and Love and Joy, Mirana a yet much sublimer way Does her Delight employ: Into her Closet she is gone (Slipt from the Company unknown) And, like a Saint does there Spread forth her Hands and breath this dutious Prayer— Your Grant, Good Heav'n, to my Request afford; Prolong the Life of my most loving Lord, And to your Left Hand Gift of Wealth, Join your Right Hand Gift of Health. Health without which no Joys can be possest, No Relish find in any Breast; The Poignance, that, and Salt of all the rest. Then will my Days like a smooth River glide, That knows no Rub, or Wrinkle in the Tyde; Then will my Breast with downy Thoughts be fill'd, Soft as their Dreams to Infants are instill'd, When sleeping, we imprinted find In beatifick Smiles their perfect Peace of Mind: And then, too will the Issue of his Bed Exult and lift aloft the Head, When they shall see their Father hale and strong, And have the Hope to keep the Blessing long. Grown up they will a great Example see How happy Vertue here may make us be, How near to Heav'n it does th'Affections bring Before the Soul takes Wing; And then in Emulation of their Sire, To Gene'rous Deeds, and their Reward aspire. Preserve him Heav'n, preserve him many Years, Then shalt thou have my Praise, as now my Pray'rs: And O! accept my Thanks for all the Space, The happy Hours I've past in his Embrace, Since Love did first our Souls combine, And I was blest to call him Mine! VI. She 'as spoke, and Heav'n does grant: Heav'n cannot turn away it's Ear From the unfeign'd and zealous Prayer Of such a chast, and beaute'ous Suppliant. Hear then Auspicious Day! And as thou yearly com'st along, Bring him still with thee cheerful, gay and strong: And since we can but a short time be Young, Let Age upon him gently steal, Gently as Sleep the Eyes of Innocence does seal, And the Effects of Age ne'er let him feel, Consumption, Dropsy, Stone, or Gout, Or any of the rueful Rout, But easily and late, Without a Sigh or murmuring Sound, Be wafted off from Life to the Celestial State; A State ineffable, to last When thou and all the Race of time are past; For 'twill at last be found, Time is but a Parenthesis in the eternal Round. Hear then, O happy Day! if you All that's impos'd on you will do, And to your sacred Charge be true; When the Records of time are open laid, And 'tis disputed there Which Day shall be the Century most illustrious made. The Muse shall then appear, Shall take Thee out and Name But ABINGDON, that Word of Fame, And straight like Joseph's Sheaves, the rest shall all Prostrate around thee fall; And Thou ascend the Regal Throne, with Scepter and with Ball. Mirtillo and Amynta: A Hymeneal Pindarick Poem, On the Marriage of James Hunt Esq; with Madam Jane Cary. I. 'Wake, sluggish Muse, from thy Lethargick Sleep, Thy downy Nest no longer keep; The Lark is up, and on extended Wings Still as she rises sweetlier sings; Let her aspiring Melody O sluggish Muse! thy Great Example be, Follow her thro' the trackless Air; Her Song does but the Way to Thine prepare: And when Y'ave overtook Her do not stay, But higher wing Your wond'ring way Above the Clouds, above The Second Heav'n, up to the Third of LOVE: There see what Flame 'tis does inspire The Am'rous Warmth of soft Desire, A Lambent, but Eternal Fire! Where the first Seeds of Inclination ly That come at last to grow so high, Or in the Fancy, Beauty, or the Eye: Then thou may'st tell how fair Amynta struck Mirtillo with a Look, Mirtillo! Lovely Swain! And how he smil'd at the Delightful Pain; (For Oh! what Youth at such a Wound wou'd grieve Tho' sure he shou'd but one short Moment live?) He smil'd, and at that very interview His Eye return'd the Shaft, and wounded her that threw. O Pleasing War! O equal Doom! Where both did Conquer, both were overcome! It will not so at all Times be, Anon she will sole Victor prove, And make him Yield who now exults and Triumps in her Love. II. Two Hearts more equal Fate did never Pair, Heav'n in their Forming had unusual Care! It's finest and Celestial Mold it took And with a Gracious Look Mingl'd the Shining Ore, and thus benignly spoke: These Two we make for One; They must be each the Others, or they both are None. Let Courser Stuff from Heav'n drop down, Of our Æthereal Dust th'Allay, Scarce fit to Animate their Clay; There let 'em make their own Precarious Fate, In Scorning soon, or Loviag late; We These for their own selves Create: In vain the Nymph all other Swains shall see, As much in vain shall He All other Nymphs behold, Tho' fair as those of old That quarrell'd for the Shining Ball of Gold. Love shall not shoot into their Breast his Fires, His Pleasing Fears, Emotions, and Desires, Till they each other chance to view, Then Sympathy at once the Work shall do. Like two fair Tapers that (at the same Instant) come “At several Doors into the Room, “Their Am'rous Lights one Light does grow; “And they, as closely joyn'd, shall so “To an Inseparable Union go; One from the First ev'n to the End; And one at last (tho' late) they hither shall ascend. III. From thy vast height (O Muse) tho' not descry'd so far, Dart like a shooting Star: But not, like that, let all that's in Thee Bright Be wasted in the Glaring Flight, But hold out still a lasting Globe of Light. Thou now art here, and now thou'rt there, And now tak'st Circles in the Air, And now strait on dost fly Beyond the Narrow Limits of the Sky; Nor Space, nor Place can bound thy vast Career. What e'er thy dull Detractors may Decree That have no tast of Poesie, Thou hast the Gift of Prophesie, Divine, and Future Things you see, And all is Visible to Thee. Into the Seeds of Time you look and show Which Grain will Perish, which will grow. The Heart, which from it's Self is hid, Cannot thy piercing Search forbid; From Thought to Thought thou on dost pass, And see'st 'em all, as in a Glass. Nor Bolts nor Locks thy Passage can impede, Thro' all thou go'st with Angel's Speed, As easie and as free As in wide Air the wanton Swallows flee. IV. 'Tis not the Curtains, then, where fair Amynta lies Can veil her from thy Eyes— They're drawn!—and see! O see! and Object that wou'd turn Old Age to Youth, and make the Icy Hermit burn. Her Head upon her Hand she leans, Hands whiter than the Paphian Queens! Her Figure wou'd more Ardor move, And sooner give the Law to Love; Sleep has not yet unloos'd his Golden Bands, Loth to let go his sacred Hold; For, to his Sorrow, soon, he understands, Another must enfold The Beauty in his Arms, And from her Lovely Eyes expel his Pow'rful Charms. Sleep must not then approach too nigh; Before he might, Indulgent to their Ease, Study new Arts to please; Let him not, then, upon their Senses seize, And rudely lock up all; Then let him come not till the Lovers call: Nor let him, when he's come, so churlish be As to deny the Mind it's Liberty; That Fancy may repeat the Pleasure past, Husband it well, and make it longer last, For waking Joy, alas! does flit away too fast. V. Here, Roving Muse, a while thy Wonder six; And while this Brightest of her Sex Lies bathing in Seraphick Dreams, Think in what Rapture, what Extremes The Youth wou'd plunge, were he now here, Unseen like Thee, and gazing on the FAIR. The Colour in his Cheeks wou'd come and go, Doubt with Desire, and Fear with Joy contend, His Pulse wou'd swifter beat, his Blood wou'd higher flow; And he wou'd speak much more than I dare apprehend. Suspend, dear Youth, those Thoughts till soon, Till Twelve at Night the Bridegroom's Noon; By that you'll to your bright Meridian climb, By that be Lifted to your Prime: O don't from thence retire While there is Fewel to maintain the Fire! O roll not down Too soon The Western Hill of soft Desire! Hold the Reins hard, nor quit the Skies; At least don't set till Heav'ns bright Lamp does rise. VI. But see! she 'wakes! and the Sun's Pow'rful Ray, But now so Lovely and so Gay, Shrinks back and dies away; Her brighter Eyes his Beams deface, And fill with fresher Glories all the Place. But Decency, the Lovers Law, Does bid us here withdraw, And leaves the Dam'sels to adorn The Radiant Nymph, that so outshines the Morn. Let meaner Shapes and meaner Faces Practise in the Glass their Graces, And with such Baits and trifling Arts Ignobly Angle for their Lovers Hearts: Amynta is above such Trivial Things, And moves the Lover by Sublimer Springs: Angels and She are much the same, Alike in Form, in Purity, and Fame, And will hereafter be in Name. That Dress which does a Cherub's Sweetness grace, Can only add a greater Lustre to Amynta's Face. VII. Where is Mirtillo? where? The Nymph has done him wrong To let him wait so long; But soon a sure Revenge he'll take, What e'er Resistance she can make, And rifle the rich Cabinet, tho' barr'd up ne'er so strong. But see! he comes! and in good Time he's here, For now the chast Amynta does appear, And on her Eye-lid hangs a Tear; What does it now do there? But Joy as well as Grief can bring That Moisture from its Briny Spring. Two Fountains from that Spring there go, One for Pleasure, one for Woe, Delight, like Pain, does oft unruly grow, And in the Rapid Course its Banks o'erflow. But now the Drop is fall'n, and in its Place A Blush does mount the Face, And adds to it one more Resistless Grace; Tho' he that saw her just before, Wou'd swear that Heav'n cou'd add no more. Mirtillo sees her pleasing Care, And his Instinctive Heart In the Transporting Anguish has its Part: Such Perfect Bliss Mortality has scarce the Power to bear, Infirmity will enter there, And in disorder'd Bounds of Joy appear: Souls only can, sedate, receive Th'Impression such a vast Delight does give; It is almost too bright to look upon and Live! So pure a Love does oft o'er pow'r the Sense, And tho' we fetch Desire and Vigor thence, Makes us sometimes, resign to very Impotence. Fixt on her Eyes, he cou'd for ever gaze! But Time reproves these vain Delays, And his own Genius whispers him—Be gone!— Suggesting something Nobler coming on In the dear Contemplation of Anon— Anon! Anon! VIII. And now th'Auspicious Path they trace That leads to a more near Embrace; Where Gracious Hymen smiling stands, As they their Hearts, to join their Hands; Attended by a shining Train Of many a Lovely Nymph, and many a Faithful Swain: Each Lovely Nymph the Nymph wou'd be, Each Faithful Swain wou'd fain be He, But so confirm'd a Happiness they ne'er must hope to see: Heav'n's Favourites on Earth are few, (For Three that Triumph Thousands rue) And they, on this Account, almost the first we knew. Have you e'er seen a Night When Cynthia put on all her Light? The Stars themselves are then not bright, But seem Eclips'd while she does fly Her glorious Progress thro' th'Obsequious Sky. As much above the rest does fair Aminta shew, Nay above Cynthia too; Aminta does not for her Lustre owe; No brighter Light does make her shine, Her Glory's all her own, And like the Sun's flows from it self alone, A Sourse as Great, as Lasting, and Divine. IX. But while the Priest his Duty does attend, What better Work can be our Care, Than begging Blessings to descend Upon the Heads and Hearts of the new joining Pair? May Wealth on their Left Hand, And Health upon their Right, Thro' a long Series smiling stand; And still before their Sight May nothing come but Prospects of Delight. And that their Peace of Mind may never be Betray'd by Infidelity, By Frailty, or by Flattery, To their Defence their Vertues stand prepar'd, And INNOCENCE be Captain of the Guard: Innocence! a safer Shield Than fam'd ACHILLES e'er in Battle held, Tho' still he came Triumphant from the Field— Nay stop not, let us still bless on— But see!—the Ceremony's done; The dear, the Mystick Knot is ty'd: Hail happy Bridegroom! Hail O Beaute'ous Bride! Joy to you both, Joys thick upon you pour Like Drops in a Prolifick April Show'r! Now let the Bells and let the Spheres, too, Ring! Let all above, and all around, To Nature's utmost Bound, The Joyful Tydings sound, That all at once may hear, at once may Io Pæan sing! X. The Boards are furnish'd now in ev'ry Room, And back the Joyful Company are come. What e'er the Elements produce, (For Blessings are no Blessings without use) Their Choicest Stores are now purvey'd, And Tribute to Montano's Board is paid. Well does he fill his Sacred Place, As well perform the Father's part; For no Man cou'd th'Occasion grace With a more Gene'rous Heart. Montano! whom the Vertuous Joy to Name, The Church's Darling, and the Theme of Fame; Wise, Nobly-born, Religious, and Benign, His Nature, like his Office, all Divine: And which is now no barren Praise In these Degen'erate Days, But will his Charity and Truth commend; Kind to the Poor, and Constant to his Friend. He does Redeem our Crimes, and show What Man was long ago, E'er Pride and Fraud, together joyn'd, Usurpt the Empire of his Mind, And turning it about, and fixing there, Had made us the Reverse of what we were. Upon this Copious Theme I shou'd dwell long, Did not the Sprightly Business of the Day To Sports and Revels hurry me away; But he shall elsewhere be our Subject for Pindarick Song. XI. Now let the nimble Goblets move, A Health to Beauty, and a Health to Love; That's to the Bridegroom and the Bride; for He Is all o'er Love, and all o'er Beauty, She, But let it not go once about, and stay, Or end with the Revolving Day, But rather last till Time is roll'd away. O for Anacreon's tuneful Lyre. That on this Subject I might sing, And drink, to keep like him on Wing, (The soft Incentive to Desire) Till I in ev'ry Soul did Love and Joy inspire! But hark! the Musick to the Dance does Play, And all the Nymphs are danc'd from hence away: Come on then, Boys, and while their Feet In smooth Harmonious Measures meet, What ever graver Noddles think, Let us keep Time, too, in our Drink; And shew who can the nimblest prove, Or we to Wine, or they to move. Away—w'ave got the Start—ne'er mind What they can do—nor look behind; Run on—that is Drink on—nor fear to fall; Ah Boys! w'ave got before 'em to the Goal; And, see! the Bard that set out last has reach'd it first of all. XII. How Musick, Wine and Love, beguile the Hours! For the bright Sun is fled Long since into his Watry Bed; I hear the Bridegroom cry, 'tis Time we were in Ours. Nor to the Virgins is the Hint in vain, They'll now no longer be deny'd, For Women know when Women feign; So kindly force away the Linge'ring Bride. And now th'Officious Hands are all employ'd, As if she were in hast to be enjoy'd: Ah! busy, busy, hasty Crew, There's Time enough till Morn for all that Man can do. But Trembling, Joyful; yet affraid, Thanks to Mirtillo's Stars, at last she's laid. The happy News he quickly hears, And lively as the Day appears To solve her Scruples, and remove her Fears. T'undress him no Observance now be shown, He needs no Hands at this Time but his own; For see! he's with her, in his Arms He has her fast, as she her Charms, That Sanctuary now from all her future Harms. Good Night! Good Night!—accept our Prayers For a long Race of Prosperous Years— W'ave done our Duty;—let 'em now do Theirs. FINIS.</field>
