      <field name="fulltext">THE SILLER GUN. CANTO FIRST. THE GATHERING, AND THE MARCH. I For loyal feats, and trophies won, Dumfries shall live till time be done! Ae Simmer's morning, wi' the sun, The Seven Trades there, Forgather'd, for their Siller Gun To shoot ance mair! II To shoot ance mair in grand array, And celebrate the King's Birth-day, Crowds, happy in the gentle sway Of ane sae dear, Were proud their fealty to display, And marshal here! III O, George! the wale o'Kings and men! For thee, in daily prayer, we bend! With ilka blessing Heaven can send May'st thou be crown'd; And may thy race our rights defend, The warld around! IV For weeks before this FÃ©te sae clever, The fowk were in a perfect fever, Scouring gun-barrels in the riverâ At marks practisingâ Marching wi' drums and fifes for everâ A' sodgerizing! V And turning coats, and mending breeks, New-seating where the sark-tail keeks; (Nae matter though the clout that eeks Be black or blue;) And darning, with a thousand steeks, The hose anew! VI Between the last and this occasion, Lang, unco lang, seem'd the vacation, To him wha wooes sweet recreation In Nature's prime; And him wha likes a day's potation At ony time! VII The lift was clear, the morn serene, The sun just glinting owr the scene, When James M'Noe began again To beat to arms, Rouzing the heart o'man and wean Wi' War's alarms! VIII Frae far and near, the country lads, (Their joes ahint them on their yads,) Flock'd in to see the show in squads; And, what was dafter, Their pawky mithers and their dads Cam trotting after! IX And mony a beau and belle were there, Doited wi' dozing on a chair; For, lest they'd, sleeping, spoil their hair, Or miss the sight, The gowks, like bairns before a fair, Sat up a' night! X Wi' hats as black as ony raven, Fresh as the rose, their beards new shaven, And a' their Sunday's cleeding having Sae trim and gay, Forth cam our Trades, some ora saving To wair that day. XI Fair fa' ilk canny, caidgy carl, Weel may he bruik his new apparel! And never dree the bitter snarl O' scowling wife! But, blest in pantry, barn, and barrel, Be blithe through life! XII Hegh, Sirs! what crowds cam into town, To see them must'ring up and down! Lasses and lads, sun-burnt and brownâ Women and weans, Gentle and semple, mingling, crown, The gladsome scenes! XIII At first, forenent ilk Deacon's hallan, His ain brigade was made to fall in; And, while the muster-roll was calling, And joybells jowing, Het-pints, weel spic'd, to keep the saul in, Around were flowing! XIV Broil'd kipper, cheese and bread, and ham, Laid the foundation for a dram O' whisky, gin frae Rotterdam, Or cherry brandy; Whilk after, a' was fish that cam To Jock, or Sandy: XV O! weel ken they wha loo their chappin, Drink maks the auldest swack and strappin; Gars Care forget the ills that happenâ The blate look spruceâ And ev'n the thowless cock their tappin, And craw fu' croose! XVI The muster owr, the diff'rent bands File aff, in parties, to the Sands; Where, 'mid loud laughs and clapping hands, Gley'd Geordy Smith Reviews them, and their line expands Alang the Nith! XVII But ne'er, for uniform or air, Was sic a group review'd elsewhere! The short, the tall; fat fowk, and spare; Syde coats, and dockit; Wigs, queus, and clubs, and curly hair; Round hats, and cockit! XVIII As to their gunsâthae fell engines, Borrow'd or begg'd, were of a' kinds For bloody war, or bad designs, Or shooting cushiesâ Lang fowling-pieces, carabines, And blunder-busses! XIX Maist feck, though oil'd to mak them glimmer, Hadna been shot for mony a Simmer; And Fame, the story-telling kimmer, Jocosely hints That some o' them had bits o' timmer, Instead o' flints! XX Some guns, she threeps, within her ken, Were spik'd, to let nae priming ben; And, as in twenty there were ten Worm-eaten stocks, Sae, here and there, a rozit-end Held on their locks! XXI And then, to show what diff'rence stands Atween the leaders and their bands, Swords that, unsheath'd, since Prestonpans, Neglected lay, Were furbish'd up, to grace the hands O' Chiefs, this day! XXII âOhon!â says George, and ga'e a grane, âThe age o' chivalry is gane!â Syne, having owr and owr again The hale survey'd, Their route, and a' things else, made plain, He snuff'd, and said: XXIII âNow, Gentlemen! now mind the motion, âAnd dinna, this time, mak a botion: âShouther your arms!âO! ha'd them tosh on, âAnd not athraw! âWheel wi' your left-hands to the ocean, âAnd march awa!â XXIV Wi' that, the dinlin drums rebound, Fifes, clarionets, and hautboys sound! Through crowds on crowds, collected round, The Corporations Trudge aff, while Echo's self is drown'd In acclamations! XXV Their steps to martial airs agreeing, And a' the Seven-Trades' Colours fleeing, Bent for the Craigs, O! weel worth seeing! They hied awa; Their bauld Convener proud o'being The Chief owr a'! XXVI Attended by his body-guard, He stepp'd in gracefu'ness unpair'd! Straught as the poplar on the swaird, And strong as Sampson, Nae ee cou'd look without regard On Robin Tamson! XXVII His Craft, the Hammermen, fu' braw, Led the Procession, twa and twa: The leddies wav'd their napkins a', And boys huzzay'd, As onward, to the Waponshaw, They stately strade! XXVIII Close to the Hammermen, behold, The Squaremen come like chiefs of old! The Weavers, syne, their flags unfold; And, after them, The Taylors walk, erect and bold, Intent on fame! XXIX The Sutors, o' King Crispin vain, March next in turn to the campaign; And, while the crowd applauds again, See, too, the Tanners, Extending far the glitt'ring train O' guns and banners! XXX The Fleshers, on this joyous day, Bring up the rereward in array: Enarm'd, they mak a grand displayâ A' jolly chiels, Able, in ony desp'rate fray, To feght like de'ils! XXXI The Journeymen were a' sae gaucy, Th' Apprentices sae kir and saucy, That, as they gaed alang the causey, Ahint them a', Th' applauding heart o' mony a lassie Was stown awa! XXXII Brisk as a bridegroom gawn to wed, Ilk Deacon his battalion led: Foggies the zig-zag followers sped, But scarce had pow'r To keep some, fitter for their bed, Frae stoit'ring owr. XXXIII For, blithsome Sir John Barleycorn Had charm'd them sae, this Simmer's morn, That, what wi'drams, and mony a horn, And reaming bicker, The ferly is, withouten scorn, They walk'd sae sicker XXXIV As through the town their banners fly, Frae windows low, frae windows high, A' that cou'd find a neuk to spy, Were leaning o'er: The streets, stair-heads, and carts, forbye, Were a' uproar! XXXV Frae the Freer's Vennel, through and through, Care seem'd to've bid Dumfries adieu! Housewives forgat to bake, or brew, Owrjoy'd, the while, To view their friends, a' marching now In warlike style! XXXVI To see his face whom she loo'd best, Hab's wife was there amang the rest; And, as, wi' joy, her sides she prest, Like mony mae, Her exultation was exprest In words like thae: XXXVII âWow! but it maks ane's heart lowp light âTo see auld fowk sae cleanly dight! âE'en now, our Habby seems as tight âAs when, lang syne, âHis looks were first the young delight âAnd pride o' mine!â XXXVIII But on the meeker maiden's part, Deep sighs alane her love assert! Deep sighs, the language o' the heart, Will aft reveal A flame whilk a' the gloss of art Can ne'er conceal! XXXIX Frae rank to rank while thousands hustle, In front, like waving corn, they rustle; Where, dangling like a baby's whustle, The Siller Gun, The royal cause of a' this bustle, Gleam'd in the sun! XL Suspended frae a painted pole, A glimpse o't sae inspir'd the whole, That auld and young, wi' heart and soul, Their heads were cocking, Keen as ye've seen, at bridals droll, Maids catch the stocking! XLI In honour o' this gaudy thing, And eke in honour o' the King, A fouth o' flow'rs the Gard'ners bring, And frame sweet posies Of a' the relics o' the Spring, And Simmer's roses! XLII Amang the flow'ry forms they weave, There's Adam to the life, and Eve: She, wi' the apple in her neeve, Enticing Adam; While Satan's laughing in his sleeve, At him and madam! XLIII The lily white, the vi'let blue, The heather-bells of azure hue, Heart's-ease for lovers kind and true, Whate'er their lot, And that dear flow'r, to Friendship due, âForget me notââ XLIV A' thae, and wi' them, mingled now, Pinks and carnations, not a few, Fresh garlands, glitt'ring wi' the dew, And yellow broom, Athort the scented welkin threw A rich perfume! XLV Perfume, congenial to the clime, The sweetest in the sweetest time! The merry bells, in jocund chime, Rang through the air, And Minstrels play'd, in strains sublime, To charm the Fair! XLVI And fairer than our Nithsdale Fair, Or handsomer, there's nane elsewhere! Pure as the streams that murmur there, In them ye'll find That Virtue and the Graces rare Are a' enshrin'd! XLVII Lang may the bonny bairns recline On Plenty's bosom, saft and kind! And, O! may I, ere Life shall dwine To its last scene, Return, and a' my sorrows tine At hame again! CANTO SECOND. ARRIVAL AT THE FIELDâBEGINNING OF THE COMPETITIONâSURROUNDING SCENERY. I Now, through the Kirkgate Port, the thrang O' men in arms proceed alang: Behold them, while the cymbals' clang Resounds afar, In a' the pomp, without the pang, Or waes of war! II Aff to the Craigs, the hale forenoon, By the best paths to get there soon, Crowds after crowds were flocking down, In nines, and tens, Deserting, fast, the bonniest town That Scotia kens! III O happy they wha, up twa story, Saw the Procession in its glory! Alang the roads it left out o'er ye, Sic clouds o' stoor, Ye cou'dna see ye'r thoomb before ye For ha'f an hour! IV Where the lang train of armour gleams, Bright PhÅbus shone in scorching beams: Parch'd up wi' heat, nae caller streams To weet their hasses, The Squadrons grein'd for ale that reams Frae Jenny Gass's! V They wha had corns, or broken wind, Begood to pegh and limp behind: Laith to sit down, and still inclin'd To try their pith, âI hope we'll dance yet, ere we've din'd,â Cries Geordy Smith. VI To cheer them wha began to fag, The Minstrels lows'd Apollo's bag, And lilted up, though still they lag, The Reel o' Boggie, And Willy was a wanton wag, Wi' Kath'rine Oggie! VII But Bruce's March to Bannockburn, To leave his banes in Freedom's urn, Or, glorious and triumphant, spurn Intended thraldom, Sae rais'd their hearts, at ilka turn, That nought cou'd hald them! VIII O! blessings on King Robert's name! On Wallace, and Sir John the GrÃ¦me! While Freedom dare assert her claim, Or Virtue blossom, Wallace and Bruce will aye enflame The Patriot bosom! IX A' this and mair, baith ane and a', They seem'd to say, and croosely craw: Out owr the hills and far awa, The Pipers play'd; And, roaring like a water-fa', The crowd huzzay'd! X The Craigs, with ivy mantled round, Re-echo'd back the jocund sound; And, as the Troops approach'd the ground, Araise to view Like some sweet islands, newly found, In fair Pelew! XI Syne, louder grew the busy hum O' friends rejoicing as they come: Wi' double vir the drummers drum, The pint-stowps clatter, And bowls o'negus, milk and rum, Flow round like water! XII âTak a gude waughtâI'm sure ye're weary,â Says Anny Kaillie to her deary: John, fain to see his wife sae cheary, Indulg'd the fun, Gat fu', and dander'd lang and eerie, And tint his gunâ XIII And miss'd, mairowr, th' endearing charms (The very thought ilk bosom warms!) Of auld acquaintances in swarms, Meeting like brithers, And wee-things giggling in the arms O' their fond mithers! XIV And bonny lasses, tight and clean, Buskit to please their ain lads' eenâ Lasses, whase faces, as the scene Its tints discloses, In glowing sweetness intervene, Like living roses! XV Convener Tamson's troop, the while, Prepare for action in great style: The laive their various firelocks pile, By three and three, And, 'tween ilk corps, for ha'f a mile, Their banners flee! XVI The drums and fifes a flourish made; Three loud huzzas the menyie gaed, And clear'd the stance, that ilka blade The mark might view, Far glist'ning, circled white and red, Wi' spraings o' blue! XVII In mingled prospect, on the plain That parts the Maiden-Craigs in twain, Craems, ginge-bread-stawns, legerdemain, And raree-shows, Entic'd young sparks to entertain, And treat their joes. XVIII For fear o' scant, whilk aften mars The best o' projects in the wars, Provisions, Ferrintosh in jars, And casks o' beer, Were rang'd, like batteries, on cars, In front and rear! XIX Then there were tents, where, frank and free, On divot-seats, sae coziely, Auld birkies, innocently slee, Wi' cap and stowp, Were e'en as blithe as blithe cou'd beâ A' fit to lowp! XX Pleas'd, they recount, wi' meikle joy, How aft they've been at sic a ploy; Descrive past scenes; re-act the boy, And a' his wheems: Sweet days of youth, without alloy, Like fairy dreams! XXI And mony a crack, and gallant tale, 'Bout bauld forebears, sae stark and hale, Inspir'd their breasts with ardent zeal, While, circling round, The reaming cogs o' nappy ale Gaed glibber down! XXII Yet, now and then, a silent tear, For friends departed, kindred dear, Friends, wha were aye the foremost here, Bedew'd ilk cheek, Mair eloquent, in grief sincere, Than tongue can speak! XXIII Amang auld cronies, Geordy Smith Discours'd of war with a' his pith: Siege follow'd siege, till kin and kith Were grown sae frisky, They wou'd have drank the river Nith Had it been whisky! XXIV To war accustom'd when a boy, A sodger's life was still his joyâ First, in the ranks at Fontenoy, And, mony a year, Like Hector on the plains o' Troy, A gen'ral here! XXV When a' the Hammermen, sae bright, Had charged their guns, like men o' might, Convener Tamson, wi' delight, The sport began; And never yet was belted knight A blither man! XXVI Meantime, the younkers on the green, In merry rounds are dancing seen: Wi' rapture sparkling in their een, They mind, fu' weel, The sappy kiss, and squeeze, between Ilk blithesome reel! XXVII And, as the Highland Flings begin, Their heels grow lighter wi' the din: They smack their hands; and, chin to chin, They cut and caper: Ev'n the bye-standers figure in, And flounce, and vapour! XXVIII The Minstrels there, were, Sandy Brown, The Piper o' Lochmaben town: Though whozzling sair, and cruppen down, Auld Sanders seem'd, His chaunter, for its cheering sound, Was aye esteem'd. XXIX Jock Willison, a Sutor bred, Wha, for the fiddle, left his trade, Jigg'd it far better than he sped, For, oh! poor Jock Cou'd ne'er gang soberly to bed, Like other fo'k: XXX Blind-fu,' at weddings, or a dance, He'd play, though like ane in a trance; And then, for feghting, Jock wou'd prance At fair, or market, And box whaever durst advance, Till they were yarkit! XXXI Yet Jock was as humane as brave, And aften for the helpless strave: To snatch the drowning frae the wave, He'd quickly dive, And to a weeping mither save Her bairn alive! XXXII To hear John Bruce exert his skill, Ye'd never grudge anither gill: O! how he scorn'd th' Italian trill, And variations; And gart his thairm-strings speak, at will, True Scots vibrations! XXXIII Nor was it only for a reel That Johnny was belov'd sae weel: He loo'd his friend, was aye genteel, And, what's far mair, John to his Prince was true and leal, Ev'n in despair! XXXIV But wha's he lilting in the rear, Sae saft, sae tunefu', and sae clear? It's Dingwall, to the Muses dear, Whase modest merit Was sae represt for want o' gear, Care crush'd his spirit! XXXV Aft, when the Waits were playing by, I've mark'd his viol with a sigh, Soothing lorn lovers, where they lie, To visions sweetâ Saft as a mither's lullaby, When babies greet! XXXVI The bonny Bush abune Traquair, And Mary Scott of Yarrow, fair; Tweedside, and O! I wish I were Where Helen lies! He play'd in tones that suit Despair, When Beauty dies! XXXVII But, 'twere owr lang to reckon a' The strains he play'd, sae saft and slawâ Strains o' the Minstrels, now awa, Sweetest and last Memorials, like our Waponshaw, Of ages past! XXXVIII By this time, now, wi' mony a dunder, Auld guns were brattling aff like thunder: Three parts o' whilk, in ilka hunder, Did sae recoil, That collar-banes gat mony a lunder, In this turmoil! XXXIX Wide o' the mark, as if to scar us, The bullets ripp'd the swaird like harrows; And, fright'ning a' the craws and sparrows About the place, Ramrods were fleeing thick as arrows At Chevy Chace! XL Yet still, as through the tents we steer, Unmov'd the festive groups appear: Lads oxter lasses, without fear, Or dance like wud; Blithe, when the guns gaed aff sae queer, To hear the thud! XLI Disporting in the sunny beam, When gentler mates are in a breem, Some seek the shade, and some the stream, And banquet there On strawberries, or cruds and cream, And country fare! XLII O! wi' what glee the Muse stravaigs Owr a' the beauties o' the Craigs!â Forgetting a' the ills and plagues That aft harass us, She scours the hills and dales, for leagues, Round this Parnassus! XLIII Sweet spot! how happy ha'e I been Seeking birds'-nests with eager een; Or, pu'ing gowans on the green, Where waving corn, Blue-bells and roses, fringe the scene, And flow'ring thorn! XLIV Yonder the lads and lasses group, To see the luckless Lover's-lowp: Wae's me that disappointed Houp, That cruel blight, Shou'd drive fowk frae this warld to scoup To endless night! XLV Beneath yon cliff, high beetling owr, Is chaste Diana's Maiden-Bow'r: There, sacred to the guardian Pow'r, A tablet stands, Inscrib'd by a' wha make that tour, In true-love's bands! XLVI Sae strait and narrow is the way, Nane but pure virgins enter may: And, O! it's droll, in this essay, When flirts, alack! Their wee infirmities betray, By turning back! XLVII Censorious Bess, that dorty dame, Cam here to carve her lover's name; But Bessy, having been to blame For failings, too, Had nearly gane to her lang hame, In squeezing through! XLVIII Hither, forbye the young and fair, Grave matrons come to tak the air; Ev'n gentry, and the sons o' care, Resort, a-wee, To view, around, the beauties rare By land and sea! XLIX At tide-time, with an anxious mind, The sailor's wife, lang left behind, Looks for her love with ilka wind, And watches here Ship after ship, to Nith consign'd, Till he appear! L Behold, far hence, in sylvan charms, Cots, country-seats, kirk-towns, and farms! Hills, circling wide, wi' sheep in swarms; And mould'ring tow'rs, Famous, langsyne, for chiefs in arms, And potent pow'rs! LI Imbower'd around, how sweet to spy Corn-rigs and orchards laughing lie! Dumfries, wi' steeples to the sky, And ships in crowds, And Criffel-hill ascending high Amang the clouds! LII Lo! glitt'ring onward to the sea, The stream that gave the Muse to me! Pure stream, on whase green banks, wi' glee, In Life's sweet morn, I chac'd the gaudy butterflee, Ere Care was born! LIII O! though it's mony a langsome year, Since, fu' o' care, and scant o' gear, I left thy banks, sweet Nith, sae dear, This heart o' mine Lowps light whene'er I think or hear O' thee, or thine! LIV In Seed-time, when thy Farmers saw, In Simmer, when thy roses blaw; In Harvest, or in frost and snaw, When Winter low'rs, My heart and mind are with ye a'â For ever your's! CANTO THIRD. THE MULTITUDE ASSEMBLEDâMOST PROMINENT CHARACTERSâTHE FEASTâCONTINUATION OF THE COMPETITIONâNOBLE DARING OF THE PEOPLE UNDER THE THREAT OF INVASION. I Still crowding to the Waponshaw, O! what a swarm o' great and sma'! See them, owr ditches, dykes, and a', Exulting, spang, Eager to join, wi' loud huzza, The jocund thrang! II As customers cam flocking in, The ale-wives thought it nae great sin To order fresh supplies o' gin, For, drouthy throttles Had left nought o' the meikle bin But empty bottles! III Hegh! what a concourse now appears O' horse, and foot, and charioteers! Farmers, and lairds, and a' their dearsâ A' ranks, and stations, Parading on, while music cheers The Corporations! IV Wi' scores o' gentlemen, and mair, Wha come their townsmen's joys to share, See brave Sir Robert Laurie there, And Eldershaw, And young Terraughtie, worthies rare, Belov'd by 'a! V Terraughtie, here a welcome guest, Was hail'd wi' raptures aft exprest: Ten thousand tongues his worth confestâ A Patriot leal, The object dearest to his breast The commonweal! VI Amang the crowd was Johnny Gass, Kend through Dumfries by lad and lass: Rever'd abune the common class, Up late and air, John had seen saxty Simmers pass, A barber there! VII The chronicle o' former years, At him ilk ane some question speers; But when they spak of auld forebears, Now dead and gane, John answer'd only wi' his tears, Or made a mane! VIII âOh, Sirs!â says he, wi' heavy granes, âHow quickly man to age attains! âI mind yon leddies when but weans, âIn leading-strings, âAnd now their oys can dance their lanes, âIn fairy-rings!â IX O! wha, amang the Wrights, is he That seems, for grace, to bear the gree? âIt's Roby Kemp: in him you see, âOn Virtue's plan, âThe traits o'true nobilityâ âAn honest man!â X For honest men, the crowd exclaim, Lang may our Trades preserve their name! âAnd if,â cries John, âat wealth they aim, âLike Richie Howat, âMay they bring gowd-in-gowpins hame, âAnd credit to it! XI âTo make a spune, or spoil a horn, âHe left Dumfries ae dowy morn, âGaed far frae hame, return'd wi' corn, âAnd wine, and oil, âAnd, glad to live where he was born, âTills his ain soil!â XII And wha's he on the milk-white steed? âWae's me!â quo' John, and shook his head: âThe gout has marr'd George Johnston's speed, âSince, in our garden, âWe ran, when boys, for gingerbread, âWi' Johnny Jardine. XIII âCracking his jokes wi' friends sae kirry, âHere's Deacon Threshie, wise and merry; âAnd yonder's blameless Willy Berry, âThe leddies' glover, âAt five-and-fifty, bright as sherry, âAnd still a lover! XIV âSedately joining in the game, âJames Hutchison now taks his aim: âAn Architect o'meikle fame; âWha plans wi' care; âAnd builds his hopes o'bliss supreme âOn praise and pray'r. XV âNeist rank to him, see Deacon Gowdy, âIn velvet coat as black's a mowdy: âA gawcier man ne'er suppit crowdy, âDid what was right, âOr lov'd Freemasonry, uncloudy, âWi' mair delight. XVI âSee, also, arm'd wi' sword and spear, âM'Ghee, our ain town's-bairn, draws near! âSirs! when the Highlandmen were here, âIn Forty-five, âHis father gart them flee for fear, âAnd skulk belyve! XVII âSent out disguis'd in Bedesman's gown, âTo watch the foe near Annan town, âThere, ere he weel had sitten down, âOr fed his filly, âUnwelcome news was buzz'd around, âAbout Duke Willie. XVIII âBack to Dumfries, in dread the while, âHe brought in word, that, mony a mile, âKing George's Army, frae Carlisle, âHad cross'd the Border: âThey come, cried he, in rank and file, âAnd battle-order! XIX âThis news, first told him as a hum, âSuin gart the Highlanders look glum: âAt night, when a' was dark and dumb, âThey vanish'd fairly, âAnd never mair, wi' pipe and drum, âSaw we Prince Charlie! XX âYet, ere his flight, to our great skaith, âHe levied fines; and, by my faith, âGlenriddel and our Provost, baith, âAwa were ta'en, âAs hostages, on pain o' death, âTo pay the Kain. XXI âAlbeit they werena lang detain'd, âOur purse, to ransome them, was drain'd: âSyne, having liberty regain'd, âThey canter'd hame, âAnd, through a weel-spent life, sustain'd âAn honour'd name! XXII âTrue to their Country, King, and Law, âMy blessings on our Burghers a'! âO! never, in their Kirk or Ha', âMay Party-strife, âDissolving bosom-friends in twa, âVex man or wife!â XXIII But wha, amang the lookers-on, With aspect meek and mild is yon? He's, sure, the sire o' mony a son, If ane may guess By them wha seem to watch the tone He wou'd express! XXIV âThat's Doctor Chapman!âshav'd by me,â Quo' John, âthir thretty years and three: âHe and his boarders come to see, âEre a' be done, âOur ance-in-seven-years' Jubilee, âThe Siller Gun!â XXV A Scholar there, wi' loud acclaim, Did homage to the good man's name: âLed by the lustre o' his fame, âFrae far and near, âLords, lairds, and nabobs, quit their hame, âTo study here! XXVI âNor is it only classic lair, âMere Greek and Latin, and nae mair: âChapman, wi' fond parental care, âHas lair combin'd âWith a' the gems and jewels rare âThat deck the mind!

XXXII With other friends, o' great desert, Wha nobly act, through life, their part, There's Hutchison, wi' kindly heart, And right gude-will, A Master o' the healing Art, Wi' meikle skill: XXXIII At Hampton, jocular and gay, Is health-restoring Halliday; Wha, making Providence his stay, Wi' firm endeavour, Frae Camps to Courts, attain'd his way To royal Favour: XXXIV Link'd in th' Ãsculapian train, Whom Nithsdale boasts of as her ain, Hyslop, wha ne'er prescribes in vain, Affords a sample How much a family may gain By gude example! XXXV O' men belanging to the Law, John Aikin was the flow'r owr a': Like Andrew Crosbie, now awa, His auld class-fellow, Through kittle points he clearly saw, Though sometimes mellow! XXXVI O! for a Muse, upon her throne, To sing o' vent'rous Clapperton, Intrepid Ross, and Richardson, Wha bade defiance To Ice-bergs, or the Torrid Zone, In aid o' Science! XXXVII Frae India, to our bonny town, Craigdarroch comes wi' high renown: The Malcolms, too, we proudly ownâ Four brother-wights, A' stedfast servants o' the Crownâ A' belted knights! XXXVIII In times when War, frae year to year, Call'd forth our Armies, far and near, Learn'd Pasley, Vict'ry's Pioneer, Before them sped, Or join'd them in their brave career, Where Glory led! XXXIX To rank amang our men o' fame, Telford upholds a double claim: O' fabrics of a splendid frame, The Engineerâ In Poesy, a Poet's name, To Eskdale dear! XL But what has been a source o' gain To Commerce and her num'rous train, Sage Miller, o' Dalswinton's plain, By Nith's sweet stream, First broach'd the Art to plough the main, Propell'd by steam! XLI Sons o' the soil frae whilk we came, We've mony mae whom we cou'd name, And, wi' them, Allan Cunningham, Wha fondly try To reach the pinnacle o' Fame, However high! XLII Hail, kindred Spirits! ane and a', Men of account, without a flaw! Pushing your fortunes, far awa, Or, fu' o' glee, Rejoicing at our Waponshaw, Dumfries, wi' thee! XLIII How beautiful, on yonder green, The tents wi' dancing pairs between! In front, though banners intervene, And guns are rattling! There's nought but happiness, I ween, In a' this battling! XLIV For miles, by people over-run, The air resounds wi' mirth and fun: Frae grave to gay, frae sire to son, And great to sma', The shooting for the Siller Gun Delights them a'! XLV Behold the concourse, here and there, Gaffawing till their sides are sair! See, as the balls whiz through the air, Yon thoughtless wights Careering till they find out where Ilk bullet lights! XLVI A chosen band, at twelve at noon, Drew up to fire in grand platoon: The troops that garrison'd the town Return'd ilk volley; And never, on the fourth o' June, Were fowk mair jolly! XLVII The cocks-and-pales were on the run; Rum-punch was flowing by the tun; Trenchers were handed round wi' bun, Cookies and baiks, Short-bread, wi' carvy nicely done, And ait-meal cakes! XLVIII Ait-meal, the staff o' life! through thee, Our sires were hearty, brave, and free! And, still preferring broze to tea, Their sons are gallant, And bear, in Arms and Arts, the greeâ Humane and valiant! XLIX But there was nought like feasting, till The grace was said by James Mackill; For, though our townsmen feast and fill, Without much pressing, They keep the gude auld custom stillâ To ask a blessing! L Convener Tamson means'd the board, Where sat ilk Deacon like a Lord: John Blackstock raise, and wav'd his sword In loyal gleeâ âGod save the King!â was twice encor'd, Wi' three times three! LI Of a' the toasts that scour their hasses, The Kirk o' Scotland, foremost passes: Dumfries, and a' her bonny Lasses, And gallant Lads, Were drank in magnum-bonum glasses, Wi' ruffs and dads! LII And, when the loud applause had ceast, âLet's fill,â exclaim'd a score at least; âFill, fill to him, for his bequeest, âIn wine unmixt, âThe royal Founder o' the Feastâ âGude James the Sixt!â LIII âPeace to his saul!â cries Deacon Gibb, And drain'd the goblet ilka drib: Syne, George the Thirdâthe Royal Ribâ The Prince, and a'â Were drank sae aft, that tongues, ance glib, Scarce wagg'd ava! LIV Where gladness beam'd in ilka face, Wha cou'd be dowf, whate'er his case? The gravest gentry o' the place In tents convene, Mix wi' their friends, and blithely grace The festive scene! LV Ev'n Maister Auld, our Letter-gae, And English Teacher, mony a day, Forgat the cares that made him wae, And lilted here Sangs that shall live till time decay, To Scotia dear! LVI He sang, wi' matchless taste and skill, The Cowden-Knowes, and Paty's Millâ My Nanny, O!-and, sweeter still, In life's decline, We'll tak a cup, in kind gude-will, For auld lang syne! LVII But, hark! throughout the tented plain, Where mirth, and wine, and music, reign, Bellona, wi' her stalwart train O' men in arms, Recals the wand'ring Muse again To War's alarms! LVIII There, still, instead o' marksmen true, To shoot at yonder target now, Some fallows held their guns askew, And some let fly Clean owr the Craigs, ayont our viewâ A mile owr high! LIX Rob Simson, sportsman bred and born, To won the Royal Prize had sworn; But windy Robin's powder-horn Blew up in air, And he had nought but skaith and scorn, And meikle care! LX Some chaps, bumbaz'd amid the yowder, Pat in the ball before the powder; Some clapp'd their guns to the wrang shou'der, Where, frae the priming, Their cheeks and whiskers gat a scowder, Their een, a styming! LXI Steeking his een, big John M'Maff Held out his musket like a staff; Turn'd, though the chiel was ha'f-and-ha'f, His head away, And, panting, cried, âSirs! is she aff?â In wild dismay! LXII Puir gowk! ne'er us'd to War's alarms, Though love o' fame his bosom warms, His fears foresaw a thousand harmsâ But here the Muse Propones, for twa-three friends in arms, A short excuse: LXIII Peace and gude-will had been sae lang The burthen o' the People's sang, Their arms like useless lumber hang: Nor fife, nor drum, Was heard, save when the fire-bell rang For some foul lum! LXIV Yet though, like children after play, In calm repose the People lay, That flame whilk lighted Bruce's way To Freedom's shrine, Cloudless as yon bright orb o' day, Ne'er ceas'd to shine! LXV For, when the French, in aftertimes, Mad wi' success, and drunk wi' crimes, Vow'd to infest our happy climes, And scourge the nation, Then, with a spirit that sublimes The humblest stationâ LXVI Then, ere our King cou'd gi'e command, Up raise the Genius o' the Land! Dumfries, in mony a chosen band, Enarm'd appears, Fit, in ae phalanx, to withstand A host o' spears! LXVII Men of a' ranks, on foot and horse, Assembled at the Market-Corss; Where, looking up to Virtue's Source, The People swore Never to let a foreign Force Pollute their shore! LXVIII Nor was this fervour only here: It spread, like wild-fire, far and near! Scotland, to ilka virtue dear, Though aft sair maul'd, Scotland was never in the rear When Danger call'd! LXIX At hame, afield, or far awa, She bore the brunt in front of a'! The last to sheathe, the first to draw Her auld Claymore, For Liberty, her King, and Law, And native shore! LXX O! in his King and Country's cause, How blest is he wha nobly fa's! Bright Fame her gowden trumpet blaws, And deathless Story Devotes his name, wi' loud huzzas, To endless Glory! CANTO FOURTH. EPISODES OF LOVE AND QUARRELâGAINING OF THE PRIZE. I 'Tween boozing, dancing, sangs, and laughing, The afternoon drew on wi' daffin: Auld fowk seem'd young again wi' quaffing Some fav'rite's name; And Love, in youthfu' breasts, was flaffing, A mutual flame! II Sic shaking hands, and kind enquiries, 'Tween Uncle Johns, and Aunty Maries! Grave dames, in a' their nice feegaries, And ancient beaus, Whistling and singing, like Canariesâ Blithe and jocose! III Croose as a cock in his ain cavy, Wha shou'd be there but Hinny Davy? The Gee, and Fare ye weel, Killavy, He sang sae sweet, His friends, though knuckle-deep in gravy, Forgat to eat! IV Some Ballad-singers, lilting lang, Paraded round and round the thrang: I wat they were a canty gang, And sung sae fine, Fowk follow'd till they learnt some sang, Like this o' mine: CRAWFORDJOHN. 1 âAs I was gawn to Crawfordjohn, âAmang the bonny blooming heather, âA blithesome laddy, passing on, âPropos'd that we shou'd gang together: âFor, O! my bonny lass, says he, âI'm quite in love wi' you already, âAnd, if ye'll trust yoursel' wi' me, âWhen I'm a laird, ye'se be a leddy. 2 âHe spak sae kind, as we gaed on, âWe didna mind the wind or weather, âFor, ere we cam to Crawfordjohn, âWe pledg'd our troth to ane anither. âThrough life he vows he'll gang wi' me, âAnd a' my thoughts are now about him, âHis simple wife I'd rather dee, âThan live a titled dame without him. 3 âThen, weel's me aye on Crawfordjohn, âAnd, O! when kindly hearts forgather, âMay never lad nor lassy moan âThat ere they met amang the heather! âFor, as to my lad and mysel', âOur lots are cast with ane anither; âAnd, hence, our bairns's bairns shall tell âHow weel we liv'd and lov'd together!â V But wha can paint yon matron's fears, Whase daughter in the dance appears? Boding nae gude frae young men's leers, She, wi' concern, Starts at ilk glance, and thinks she hears Her ruin'd bairn! VI She sees, wi' meikle grief and pain, Jock getting fu', and Jenny fain; And sighs for fear that guilt shou'd stain Yon spotless face, Flush'd, like red roses after rain, Wi' modest grace! VII Aft to the whins, frae 'mang the thrang, Some laddy and his lassy gang; But, O! the sports sae sweet and lang, Within that shade, Beguile to mony a future pang The yielding maid! VIII Amang the laive was country Johnny, Wi' his joe Meg as braw as ony: Nae doubt she thought hersel' as bonny As ony there; But, lang ere e'en, her cockernonny Was toozel'd sair! IX For, when the slee intriguing clown Had fairly danc'd his partner down, Cauld whisky-punch, and ale, nut-brown, He gart her sweel, 'Till, dizzy, a' the warld ran round, As in a reel! X 'Twas then, in ecstacy, he saw Her weel-turn'd ancle, straught and sma'! Her neck, her heaving breast, and a'! O! strange delight! Wow! what is man or maid ava, In sic a plight? XI For, owr the mind, when Drink presides, In pranks o' sin and shame it prides: To Wisdom's ways it never guides, But brings to view A thousand fau'ts whilk Temp'rance hides In me and you! XII Still, where encamp'd the Sev'n Trades lie, Their gilded banners proudly fly: Still to the stance detachments hie, And cock their guns, While troops o' friends are standing by, To see wha wons! XIII Elsewhere, the Youth of ilka Trade, Their first attempt, as Marksmen, made; And, to their credit, be it said, That this day's muster Conferr'd distinction on their grade, And nae sma' lustre: XIV Contending for a bran new hat, To wear on Sundays, and a' that, Like riflemen, they were sae pat, And aim'd sae true, The Mark whilk they were shooting at Was riddled through! XV 'Till now, while thund'ring guns resound, The feast prevails, the glass gaes round: Pastime and harmony abound, And fond entreatingâ Pleasures that ha'e, for ages, crown'd This merry meeting! XVI Bright PhÅbus, frae his azure clime, Shone sweetly radiant a' the time! Nature hersel' was in her primeâ When fruits and flow'rs Fill the glad heart wi' thoughts sublime Of heavenly Powers! XVII But word was brought to Deacon Greer, Intrench'd wi' friends, pies, bread, and beer, That, counter to a mandate clear, Ane o' the Snobs, Vain as a peacock, strutted here In crimson robes! XVIII This news, though nought cou'd happen droller, Bred the hale party meikle dolour: A Taylor, mair frae spleen than valour, Assail'd the man, And, taking Crispin by the collar, To carp began: XIX âYe gude-for-naething Sutor hash, âThough muisted is your carrot pash, âTell me, I say, thou Captain Flash, âWithouten charter, âWhat right ha'e ye to wear this sash, âAnd star and garter?â XX âIt sets ye weel, indeed, to speer,â The Sutor answer'd with a sneer: âI represent King Crispin here! âWhile, fye for shame, âYour lousy Craft to manhood ne'er âCou'd yet lay claim!â XXI Cut to the quick wi' this rebuff, The captious Taylor grew mair gruff; And, swearing he was better stuff Than sic a foutre, Stripp'd, in a twinkling, to the buff, And brav'd the Sutor. XXII âA ring, a ring!â the Sutors cry'd: âA ring, a ring!â the Snips reply'd: Some egg'd them on; and, while some try'd To stop their flyting, The crowd fell back, encircling wide A space for fighting! XXIII In dread for what might happen neist, Around the ring the clamour ceast: Sae croose the twa set up their creest, Before the toolie, Fowk thought in other's wames, at least, They'd sheath a goolie. XXIV Wi' looks that ill conceal'd his fears, The Taylor in the lists appears: King Crispin, wha in nobler weirs Had aften bled, His brawny arm, indignant, rears, And, dauntless, said: XXV âNow tak, thou warst o' worthless things, âThe vengeance due frae slighted Kings!â Wi' that, his garments aff he flings, And, as he strack, The supple Taylor skips and springsâ Aye jeuking back! XXVI To see fair play, or help a frien', Fowk stoiter'd frae a' airts, bedeen: Auld wives, to redd them, ran between, Like Amazons, And nought was heard, syne, owr the green, But scraighs and groans! XXVII The Taylor-lad, forfoughten sair, Was knockit down, ance, twice, and mair; His baffled comrades, in despair, Draw quickly near him, Heeze up his carcase on a chair, Revive, and chear him. XXVIII Besprent wi' blood, besprent wi' glar, His een japann'd, his chafts a-jar, âBe thankfu', man, it is nae war,â Says Edom Bryon, âA living dog is better far âThan a dead lion!â XXIX 'Mid loud huzzas, and women's squeels, A dawn of hope the Taylor feels; Feghts like a cock that rins and wheels, While, dunt, dunt, dunting, Crispin pursues, trips up his heels, And leaves him grunting! XXX Vex'd at the upshot o' this fray, The Taylors bore their friend away: Crispin remain'd in kingly sway; And, loud and lang, Bursts of wild joy, âhurray! hurray!â Exulting, rang! XXXI Frae Johnny Groats's to the Border, Was ne'er sic tumult and disorder: Here Discord strave new broils to forder: There, Beagles flew To haud the Sutor-lads in order, But nought wou'd do. XXXII Rob Kinnie, Clench, and Jeamy Strong, And twa-three mae, the feght prolong: Where'er they cam, aff flew the throng O' country billies, Like cattle prodit with a prong, Or cleg-stung fillies. XXXIII There's little wisdom in his pow Wha lights a candle at the lowe: To bell the cat wi' sic a scrow, Some swankies ettled; But, O! they gat a fearfu' cowe Ere a' was settled! XXXIV Rushing like droves o' madden'd nowt, Rob's party caus'd a gen'ral rout: Foul play or fair; kick, cuff, and clout; Right side, or wrang, Friends feghting friends, rampag'd about, A drucken thrang! XXXV In vain Convener Tamson rais'd And wav'd his hand, like ane ha'f craz'd: In vain his heralds fleech'd and phras'd, Where Strife, lang brewing, Threaten'd, like Ilium when it blaz'd, Baith wreck and ruin! XXXVI To furnish weapons for th' affray, Craems, tents, and stawns, were swept away: Puist fowk, unus'd to cudgel-play, And doose spectators, Were a' involv'd in this deray, Like gladiators! XXXVII Nor cou'd ye ken, wi' nicest care, The victors frae the vanquish'd there: Like Kelton-Hill, that feghting Fair, The hubbleshew, Wi' neeves, and staffs, and rugging hair, Sae awsome grew! XXXVIII And aft, as ye may weel suppose, In broils where women interpose, Baith parties gat the sairest blows, Blows that were gi'en them While pu'd and haul'd by their ain joes, Striving to screen them! XXXIX Thus, lang and sair, our pleasures crost, The battle rag'd frae host to host; The turbulent, when uppermost, Tint a' decorum, And, like the Ocean, tempest-tost, Drave a' before them! XL At length a parley is decreedâ Parties shake hands, and are agreed: The crowd, dispersing, join wi' speed In nobler fun, The shooting for that royal Meedâ The Siller Gun! XLI Amid the scenes, depainted here, O' love, and war, and social cheer, Auld Sportsmen fired correct and clear; And Samuel Clark, Mild as the Spring, when flow'rs appear, Just miss'd the mark! XLII Auld Sodgers, too, and honest Tars, Return'd triumphant frae the wars, Level'd their guns like sons o' Mars, While mony a dame Extol'd the glory o' their scars, And deeds o' fame! XLIII Yet, oh! examples were but few Of hardiment, like their's, I trow: When Geordy Rae his trigger drew, The bowel-hive Gart meikle Geordy change his hue Four times or five! XLIV When his gun snappit, James M'Kee, Charge after charge, charg'd to the ee: At length she bounc'd out owr a tree, In mony a flinnerâ âFor Gude's sake, bairns! keep back!â cries he: âThere's sax shot in her!â XLV Loud leugh the crowd at Watty Lock, Whase gun exploded at ha'f-cock: âHoot,â cries a friend, by way o' joke, âMy honest carl, âYour gun wants only a new stock, âNew lock, and barrel!â XLVI Wull Shanklin brought his firelock hither, And cock'd it in an unco swither: Ae drucken Sutor jeer'd anither To come and learnâ Fuff play'd the primingâheels owr ither, They fell in shairn! XLVII Just in the moment o' disgrace, Convener Tamson saw their case: O! how he hid his manly face, And fleech'd thae fallows To think upon the glorious race O' godlike Wallace! XLVIII William M'Nish, a Taylor slee, Rouz'd at the thought, charg'd his fuzee; Took but ae vizzy wi' his eeâ The bullet flies Clean through the target to a tee, And wons the Prize! XLIX His winsome wife, wha lang had miss'd him, Press'd thro' the crowd, caress'd and kiss'd him: Less furthy dames, (wha cou'd resist them?) Th' example take; And some held up his bairns, and bless'd them, For daddy's sake! L In William's hat, wi' ribbons bound, The Gunny was wi' laurel crown'd; And, while in triumph owr the ground They bore him tenty, His health in streams o' punch gaed round, âLang life and plenty!â LI Wi' loud applause, frae man and woman, His fame spread like a spate wide foaming! Warse deeds hae gi'en to mony a Roman Immortal fame; But prodigies are grown sae common, They've tint the name! CANTO FIFTH. RETURN HOMEâBIRTH-DAY BANQUET IN THE TOWN'S-HALL, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE MAGISTRATESâASSEMBLIES AND THE PLAYâ BONFIRES AND OTHER REJOICINGS CONCLUDE THE FESTIVITY. I While round the Victor and his Prize, Shouts frae applauding crowds ariseâ While to Dumfries the rumour flies, âM'Nish has won!â And Minstrel-harps immortalize The Siller Gunâ II Our Troops, ance mair, frae Warfare free, Resolve to ground their arms a-wee; Ilk Squadron, in their grand marquee, To chant a chorus, And drink, wi' heart-endearing glee, A deochandorus! III Meanwhile, like midges in the sun, Frae tent to tent the wee-things run; Lasses, to dance wi' him wha won, Are forward pressing; And meikle, meikle is their fun, And fond caressing! IV But soon, to finish the campaign, âTo arms! to arms!â resounds amain: The Seven Trades, syne, a' rank'd again In due gradation, March frae the Craigs, a glitt'ring trainâ A grand ovation! V The crowd, in token of applause, Threw up their hats as black as craws; And follow'd fast, wi' loud huzzas, Except a few Whase hearts, owr zealous in the cause, Were squeamish now! VI Far as the keenest ee cou'd run, The waving flags, and mony a gun, Buskit wi' flow'rs, and yellow whun, Sae sweetly shining, Stream'd like a rainbow, while the sun Was just declining! VII And, as the troops drew near the town, With a' the ensigns o' renown, The Magistrates paraded down, And a' the Gentry, And Love and Friendship vied to crown Their joyous entry! VIII âSee, see the conq'ring Hero comes!â The Band struck up with a' their drums: Louder the big bass-fiddle bumms, The cymbals jingle, And, in ten thousand thousand hums, Glad voices mingle! IX Close by Convener Tamson's side, The Victor march'd wi' stately stride: The Seven-Trades'-Flag, unfurl'd sae wide, Was borne before; And the lang train advanc'd wi' pride, By corps and corps! X To Mistress Corsane's when they came, The Deacons hail'd the comely dame; Took aff their hats; extol'd her name, And, marching on, Lower'd their flags to worth and fame, Where'er they shone! XI Like roses on a castle-wa', The Leddies smil'd upon them a': Frae the Auld Kirk to the Trades'-Ha', And New Kirk-steeple, Ye might have walk'd a mile or twa On heads o' people! XII âO! what can keep our John sae lang?â Cries Meggy Muncy, in the thrang: âI left him happy, hale, and strang, âWi' sash and sword onâ âGude grant there may be naething wrang âWi' Johnny Gordon!â XIII Lang, lang they dander'd to and fro, Wha miss'd a kinsman or a beau: The pomp and splendour o' the Show, To them and their's, Brought nought but apprehensive woe, And fruitless cares! XIV Back to the Craigs they hie again, To seek their friends amang the slain: By the road-sides, and on the plain, The drucken crew, Heart-sick, and penitent in vain, Were unco fu'! XV The Muse is sorry to pourtray The fuddled heroes o' the day: Nae camp, when War has reft away Her brightest sons, Cou'd sic a ruefu' scene display O' men and guns! XVI Their firelocks broke, their doublets torn, And eke King Crispin a' forlorn! Here lay, beside the bugle-horn, A cat-gut strummer; And there, blithe herald o' the morn, The Parish-drummer! XVII Ev'n Geordy Smith, though stark and slee, Was there as fu' as fu' cou'd be: Reviewing still, in Fancy's ee, The martial trainâ âNow, Gentlemen! tak tentââ cries he, And snor'd again! XVIII Carts, syne, wi' sic as dughtna gae, Were pang'd till they cou'd haud nae mae: Rob Kinnie, Clench, and sic as thae, Now blind and lame, Sad wights! wi' ribs baith black and blae, Were harel'd hame! XIX When fowk are in a merry pin, Weel fortify'd wi' Highland gin, They'll eithly thole a weel-peyd skin, Or crackit crown; And nowther care nor sorrow fin', Though streaming down! XX Yet, soon as sober sense returns, Yestreen's debauch the Drunkard mourns: His feckless body aft he turns, O! dool and wae! Sair griev'd, a fev'rish heart-ache burns Wi' him next day! XXI But turn, my Muse, frae scenes debasing, To windows fill'd wi' Beauty gazingâ To streets wi' happy thousands praising The passing Show; And bonfires crackling loud, and blazing, As on they go! XXII Ding, ding, ding, dang, the bells ring in, The Minstrels screw their merriest pin; The Magistrates, wi' loyal din, Tak aff their cau'kers; And boys their annual pranks begin, Wi' squibs and crackers! XXIII Wae's me for Deacon Ronald's jeezy, That sat sae orthodox and easy! For, while he smil'd at his ain Leezy, A squib cam whizzing, Set a' its ringlets in a bleezy, And left them bizzing! XXIV And wae's me, likewise, for the folly, That fowk, ha'f-fu', shou'd fire a volley! As through the town they march'd sae jolly, A feu de joie Had nearly led to melancholy, And great annoy! XXV Tat, tat, a-rat-tat, clitter, clatter, Gun after gun, play'd blitter, blatter: A random shot, not level'd at her, Hit Nanny Nairmâ Gart bonny Nanny's blue een water, And hurt her arm! XXVI This, when Convener Tamson saw, He griev'd, and soon dismiss'd them a'; Syne, wi' the Deacons, scour'd awa, By Maister Wylie's, And took his seat at the Town's-Ha', Amang the Bailies. XXVII Arriving in an unco flutter, The coffee-cups began to clutter; But first, Mass John, grave Doctor Mutter, Wi' pious care, And a' the zeal that Grace cou'd utter, Preferr'd this Pray'r: XXVIII âO Thou! by whose resistless law, âKings, Kingdoms, Empires, stand or fa'! âWatch owr this Realm; bless great and sma'; âKeep, keep us free! âAnd fill our hearts wi' rev'rend awe âFor Truth and Thee!â XXIX The Town-Clerk next, a fallow fine, Wha ne'er loo'd water in his wine, Gart bring the great big gardevine, And fill the glasses: Wi' thrice three cheers, in bumpers, syne, The claret passes! XXX The King, and other loyal toasts; Health, peace, and plenty, round our coasts; Our fleets, and a' our armed hosts, Were drank aloud; And names of whilk the Country boasts, And may be proudâ XXXI The Johnstons, Lords of Annandale, The Douglasses, and Murrays, hale, The Maxwells,fam'd thro' Nith's sweet vale, Kirkpatricks, too, And him, of a' that's gude, the wale, The great Buccleugh! XXXII Duncan's, a never-dying name! And Abercromby's, dear to Fame! Wallace, and Bruce, Sir John the GrÃ¦me, And names like their's, Heroesand Patriots shall proclaim To Scotland's heirs! XXXIII Scotland! my ain dear native land! England, her Sister, great and grand! Wou'd Ireland join us, heart and hand, Without commotion, Our Faes wou'd crumble like the sand Before the Ocean! XXXIV The Provost spoke a speech belyve: âWha can the valiant Scots descrive? âAye foremost where the bravest strive, âAnd aye victorious; âOr, hindmost, wi' the few alive, âRetreating glorious!â XXXV Of early scenes the Singers sung, In days of yore, when Life was young! When Music dwelt on ilka tongue; And a' the Arts To Peace their gowden harps had strung, Wi' lightsome hearts! XXXVI The Bailies caught the welcome strain, And made the Ha' resound again: âGod save the King,â and bless his reign, And still watch o'er usâ And âRule, Britannia, rule the mainââ Were sung in chorus! XXXVII When healths were drank to friends awa, And benisons invok'd on a', The Court-house rang wi' âSir James Shaw,â A pattern, bright, Of virtue, reverential awe, And Truth upright! XXXVIII But vain is a' the Poet's art To paint this banquet o' the heartâ The Town's-fowk a' on the alert, The grave, the gay, Happy to meet, and laith to part, On sic a day! XXXIX And where cou'd Love or Fealty trace A mansion like this bonny place? Where Manliness, in a' its grace, Protects the landâ Where Beauty's saft enchanting face Is blithe and bland! XL Nor is it only, here and there, Ae bonny Lassy, and nae mair! O' Beauties, gracefu' as they are Throughout the nation, Dumfries can boast, beyond compare, A constellation! XLI For them, Assemblies and the Play Conclude the pleasures o' the day: In Birth-day-dress, sae fine and gay, The Belle and Beau, In chairs and chariots, stop the wayâ A splendid show! XLII A' ranks in loyal freaks agreeing, The mingled scene was weel worth seeing: Big bonfires hereâthere, boys te-heeingâ Crowds on the streetsâ Dead cats, and duddy doublets fleeing, And burning peats! XLIII But Bailie Clark, wha seldom brooks The pastime that like mischief looks, Sent for John Doogan frae the Neuks, And, at his ca', John quench'd the fires, and fley'd, like rooks, The boys awa! XLIV Lang had the callans, morn and noon, Look'd forward to the fourth o' June; And sair they grudge, when now, in tune, The joy-bells chime, Their pleasures cropt, like flow'rs owr soon, This happy time! XLV Yes, happy time, and scenes renown'd, Now only in remembrance found! For, oh! though terms and tides come round, The days of yore, Like water sprinkled on the ground, Are seen no more! XLVI Hame, as the gloaming nearer draws, Convener Tamson slips his wa's; Where wife and weans, in a' their braws, And best complexion, Crown the last transports of applause Wi' sweet affection! XLVII Jocosely, in the gardy chair, He tells the day's adventures there; Syne, ere the bairns to bed repair, For mercies given, His gratefu' thoughts, in fervent pray'r, Ascend to Heaven! XLVIII With his, our closing strain shall be, May Scotland, happy, brave, and free, Aye flourish like the green bay-tree! And may Dumfries, In a' her revelry and glee, Blend Love and Peace! XLIX And may this day, whate'er befa', The King's Birth-day, our Waponshaw! Be hail'd wi' joy by great and sma', And through the land, May Concord, Liberty, and Law, Gae hand in hand! L What tho', Dumfries, some awkward blades Compear'd wi' muskets and cockades, Thy Waponshaw, in a' its shades O' praise or blame, Shall memorize thy Seven Trades, And gild their name! LI To gild thy name, may ilka Grace Adorn the annals o' thy Race, May stedfast Justice rule the place With equal scales, And tender Mercy shew her face Where doubt prevails! LII And shou'd the Fates, till death ensue, Detain me still, sweet Nith! frae you, O! if, frae yon bright realms, anew, The state o' bliss, Departed spirits may review A warld like thisâ LIII Then, when Dumfries, thy Siller Gun, In future times, is lost and won, The spirit o' the Bard, thy son, Shall hover near, And flighter, till the day be done, Round scenes sae dear! THE KING'S WELCOME TO SCOTLAND. THURSDAY, AUGUST XV, MDCCCXXII. I King George the Fourth is coming down To see his Friends in Enbro-town; To hold his Court, and wear the Crown O' Scotland's Kings, and a' that! And a' the Chieftains o' the North, Lords, Leddies, Lairds, and Men of worth, Are flocking to the Firth o' Forth, To welcome him, and a' that! II Whole days, ere yet he reach'd the land, A happy People, hand in hand, Were rang'd, for miles, alang the strand, Expecting him, and a' that! Festoon'd wi' garlands, owr and owr, Leith-walk was an enamel'd bow'r, Where Beauty, that enchanting flow'r, Adorn'd the paths, and a' that! III Meantime, wi' mony a bonny sang, The streets and squares of Enbro rang: Minstrels, and music-bells, ding-dang, Play'd loyal tunes, and a' that: Enthusiastically loud, The ballad-singers charm'd the crowd, 'Till, onward, like a flying cloud, They hied to Leith, and a' that! IV At length, amid ten thousand cheers, Behold, the royal Barge appears! And, hither as the Squadron steers, Wi' gilded flags, and a' that, The joy-bells ring, the trumpets sound; And now, while thund'ring guns rebound, âGod save the Kingâ is sung around, Wi' tears o' joy, and a' that! V Weel might our Liege, wi' pride, survey The shores o' Fife and Lothian gay: Here, mingled crowds, in grand array, In pleasure-boats, and a' that; There, merchant-men, and ships of war, Wi' sailors perch'd on ilka spar, And, yonder, beacons blazing far, Edina's tow'rs, and a' that! VI Yes, George the Fourth might weel be vain To view, in Scotland, his domain, A Land that can his rights maintain, Defend his throne, and a' thatâ A race that, since the first o' time, Ha'e shone supreme, in ilka clime, For Arms, for Arts, and Works sublime, Heroic Deeds, and a' that! VII What though our King has Kingdoms three, And mony an Island in the sea? Auld Scotland strives to bear the gree, For loyalty, and a' that: Devoted to their Country's weal, Her hardy Sons are true and lealâ Men fit to feght the very de'il, For Kirk and King, and a' that! VIII As nearer land the Monarch drew, Wi' shouts the welkin rung anew; A louder blast the Pipers blew, Saluting him, and a' that: His stately form, his gracefu' mien, Majestic, dignified, serene, Increas'd the grandeur o' the scene, And warm'd our hearts, and a' that. IX To give him, in chivalric mood, A Scotch convoy to Holyrood, The learn'd, the wise, the great, the good, The grave, the gay, and a' that: Archers, his guards by ancient right, Clansmen, and Celts, and Chiefs o' might, And Yeomanry, a glorious sight! Escort their King, and a' that. X And, lo! at yon triumphal gate, The Clergy, Judges, Lords o' State, And Magistrates, wi' heralds, wait, To hail their King, and a' that. Invoking a' the heavenly pow'rs To crown wi' happiness his hours, The damsels strow the streets wi' flow'rs, And singers sing, and a' that: THE KING'S LANDING. 1 âO! busk ye, busk ye, lad and lass, âBusk ye, busk ye, man and woman! âMake haste and see our Nobles passâ âThe King and a' his train are coming! âO! heard ye not the cannon roar, âProclaiming loud to Lord and Leddy âThe King is landing on our shoreâ âHe's landed down at Leith already! 2 âHe comes! he comes in gallant trim, âWi' robes o' state, and banners streaming; âAnd, as he comes, all eyes on him âWi' tears of ecstacy are beaming! âO, welcome! welcome to this Landâ âThis Land where all the Virtues blossom! âOur Men shall guard thee, heart and handâ âOur Leddies press thee to their bosom!â XI Wi' melody on ilka tongue, A' day, thy streets, Auld Reekie, rung! Ten thousand thousand voices sung âGod save the King,â and a' that! As through the crowd his steeds advanc'd, The Monarch seem'd wi' joy entranc'd, And auld and young wi' gladness danc'd To see their King, and a' that! XII Frae battlements, and turrets high, And windows peopled to the sky, While kerchiefs wave, and banners fly, Exultingly, and a' that; On balconies, frae street to street, On Calton-Hill, and Arthur's-Seat, The Leddies look'd like Angels sweet, Seraphic forms, and a' that! XIII The King, through life a courteous knight, Beheld, with wonder and delight, This galaxy o' beauty bright, And kiss'd his hand, and a' that: The Concourse, in a breathless pause, Gaz'd on their Sire wi' mute applause; Syne, rent the air wi' loud huzzas, And clapping hands, and a' that! XIV At night, to recreate and rest, Dalkeith receiv'd the Royal Guest; Dalkeith, o' palaces the best For tranquil bow'rs, and a' that. Refresh'd, and gladden'd, day by day, He came forth wi' the noontide ray, And held his Court, a grand display, At Holyrood, and a' that! XV Within this domicile o' Kings, Owr lang the raven flapp'd its wings: In better times, our palace rings Wi' drawing-rooms, and a' that: At intervals, the minstrel train Recall Queen Mary's days again; Or lilt up, in a bolder strain, The deeds o' Bruce, and a' that! XVI Buccleugh! benevolent and bland, The best o' Landlords in the land, Sat by his Royal Sov'reign's hand, And shar'd his smiles, and a' thatâ Buccleugh! at whose exalted name The Muse wou'd snatch a wreath frae fame To gratulate the happy Dame Wha won his heart, and a' that! XVII Be their's the Peace, beyond all praise, The Peace of Heaven, and heavenly ways; Connubial bliss, and length o' days, And bonny Bairns, and a' that! For what, to Parents, can afford A greater joy, in fond accord, Than Children round about their board, Wi' rosy cheeks, and a' that? XVIII Frae Banquets to the Ball or Play, The Monarch mingled wi' the gay: When Sabbath came, that sacred day, He grac'd our Church, and a' that: The Church o' Scotland was his choice, And, what made a' her Friends rejoice, The Congregation heard his voice, In Zion's Songs, and a' that! XIX At Holyrood, upon his throne, A blaze o' beauty round him shone; The noblest blood in Caledon Appear'd at Court, and a' that! The courtly circle o' St. James, Though lang renown'd for lovely dames, And gallant men, maun share their claims Wi' Holyrood, and a' that! XX O, Scotia! Land of hills and lakes! Land o' the Brave! sweet Land o' Cakes! Whene'er the King his pleasure takes Amang your tow'rs, and a' that, Where'er he rests, where'er he moves, Regard him with your purest loves, And may his coming, like the dove's, Betoken Peace, and a' that! XXI In him the Royal Line appears O' Scotland's Kings, his great Forebears, Wha reign'd for mony a hundred years In troubled times, and a' thatâ Till that blest day which saw the close O' Scots and English feuds and woes, And join'd the Thistle to the Rose, In Unity, and a'that! XXII Ah! mony a dowy day has been Since Scotland saw a King or Queen! Empires and states, and thrones, I ween, Ha'e been o' erturn'd, and a' that! Yet Scotland, without crack or flaw, Stands fast and firm, and ne'er shall fa' While Virtue, amang great and sma', Adorns her Bairns, and a' that! XXIII Then cock your bonnet, ilka blade! And, buskit in your belted plaid, Let rites and honours due be paid To Royalty, and a' that: Though Kings and Queens of high renown Ha'e flourish'd aft in Enbro-Town, A better never wore the crown Than George the Fourth, with a' that! XXIV But, oh! while guns and cannons roar, And plaudits welcome him on shore, The heart is wounded to the core That we maun part, for a' that! Yet fill your goblets till they foam; And, when the King's dispos'd to roam, He'll look on Scotland as his home, And come again, and a' that! APOSTROPHE TO THE RIVER NITH. Hail, gentle Stream! for ever dear Thy rudest murmurs to mine ear! Torn from thy Banks, though far I rove The slave of poverty and love; Ne'er shall thy Bard where'er he be, Without a sigh remember thee! For there my infant years began, And there my happiest minutes ran, And there, to filial duty true, The blossoms of affection grew! âBlest days, when fond parental care First led me to the House of Prayer; And, full of precepts from above, Inspir'd my earliest song of love! Blithe on thy Banks, thou sweetest Stream That ever nurs'd a Poet's dream! Oft, in the intervals of school, I've plung'd across thy deepest pool; Or, fishing in forbidden time, (If youth could sanctify a crime!) With hazel rod, and fraudful fly, Ensnar'd thy beauteous salmon-fry; In pairs have haul'd them out, till when, Pursu'd by lurking fishermen, Away I've flown, as fleet as wind, My lagging followers far behind; And, when the vain pursuit was o'er, Return'd successful as before! Still, on thy Banks, thou sweetest Stream That glitters to the morning-beam, May youthful sports and joys resound; True love and poesy abound; And, in despite of boyish crimes, The fishing in forbidden times, Safe may thy fry in myriads glide To Solway Firth, and Ocean wide; And thence again, matur'd and hale, Enrich the streams through Niddisdale; While I, like some lorn pilgrim, roam Far from thy Banks, my native home! [If ever yet to erring man 'twere given] If ever yet to erring man 'twere given, To walk according to the will of Heaven, At Ewell, daily doing good, we see That godlike man, benignant Reid, in thee! [Bonaparte, o'er the sea] 1 Bonaparte, o'er the sea, Threatens you and threatens me; Single-handed though we be, We'll gar him rue the laive o't. Let him come, or let him send, Back again he'll never bend; Our island is his journey's end, He'll only get a grave o't. 2 And for the fiend-like sons o' strife, Wha'd stain the soil that gave us life, By a' that's dear to man and wife An inch they'll never have o't. We'll fight like men wha daur be free, We'll mak them fa', or gar them flee; And, when we've drown'd them in the sea, We'll triumph o'er each wave o't. 3 O! for his country, when she calls, How blest is he wha nobly falls! Loud Fame records him in her halls, And Glory tells the brave o't! Sound, sound your pipes, your trumpets blaw, To arms, to arms! huzza, huzza! Our king, our liberty and law, Our country, or a grave o't! TO THE ARMY AND NAVY RETURNING FROM THE WAR. The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 Gallant troops from Waterloo, Wellington's companions true, All to whom our thanks are due, For battles bravely won: Glory gain'd and peace restor'd, Welcome home to sheathe the sword, Bless your king, and praise the Lord, For wonders he hath done! 2 When the French, a fiend-like band, Threaten'd to despoil the land; When their Chief, with fiery brand, Was Europe's deadly foe; Britain, with her flag unfurl'd, From his throne the Usurper hurl'd! Britain sav'd a falling world, And laid the Tyrant low! 3 Sailors of great Nelson's crew, Wealth and fame we owe to you; Trafalgar, and Waterloo, The war with glory crown'd! See, brave heroes of the Nile, Commerce re-illumes our isle; Providence still deigns to smile, And gladdens all around! 4 Shou'd the Foemen, bold again, Dare us to the battle plain, Heart and hand, with might and main, We'll arm by land and sea. Waterloo and Trafalgar, In our minds a leading star, Shall guide our fleets and hosts afar To glorious victory! 5 Gallant troops from Waterloo, Sailors of great Nelson's crew, All who wou'd, like Britons true, The race of glory run: Hail your Prince with one accord, Bless the King and praise the Lord, Ever be His name ador'd For wonders he hath done!</field>
