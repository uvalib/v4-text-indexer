      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I EARLY POEMS A DREAM OF A KISS Last night I dreamed a dream of a kiss And awoke the better for fancied bliss. I dreamed of a maiden dear to me Whom alas! but seldom in fact I see; I had said “good-bye” to the rest I know, And, waiting alone in a room below, I found my darling, my love, my queen, She and I only, no soul between. And we clasped hands as lovers should do, And thrills of lovers the palms passed through, And she leaned forward—I hardly dare To talk to the paper of gifts so rare; She leaned forward—again I repeat She leaned forward—the words are sweet— And closed my lips with a maiden kiss, Maiden, the first one, first-fruit of bliss. O sweet firstling, first in a dream, Passing sweet to my lips you seem; I pray that the phantom-kiss may endure, And seal my lips and burn them pure! And then we parted; a word I said, And “Love” was the word,—then the bright dream fled. Yet as I went I breathed a prayer; “God be with you,” my maiden fair: And that pure prayer I desire to repeat; “The God of the daylight be with you, sweet!” O Sender of Dreams, that the dream may be In some way or other true to me! 1870. “SIGHS THE WIND” Sighs the wind to-night like a voice from far-away regions Bringing in memories of foam flung wide on the waves of the past, And echoes of long-lulled laughter, and shafts and lances in legions From the homes of the dead hurled forth high horsed upon wings of the blast! 1870. “EYES OF BEAUTY” Eyes of beauty, eyes of fire, Rousing in me mad desire, Rousing love that cannot tire; Eyes of beauty, eyes of green, Sea-sweet colour, seldom seen, Rippling eyelashes between; Eyes of beauty, eyes of brown, Lovely, lowly, looking down, Conquering wholly whom they crown; Eyes of beauty, eyes of grey, Soft as night-time, bright as day, Born to govern, born to sway; Eyes of green and brown and grey, Fairer than noon's sunniest ray, I love you more than words can say! 1870. THE ENCHANTRESS OF THE SHORE I. This is the song she sang to me, Upon the grass, beneath the tree, That summer cloudless diamond day We were together: when I lay Content her peerless face to see. “Sleep, love, and let the ages run their weary Wild way as they have hastened heretofore, But do not thou be busy any more With social schemes, and systems dusty, dreary,— But stay with me and I will be thine eerie Witch-Lady, thine Enchantress of the Shore. “Yea, I will kiss thee—once—no more—contented With this thou hast to be, if thou wilt go To be a bubble on the ebb and flow Of that strong tide of action man invented, Because his soul was loveless and consented Not pure passivity of life to know. “But if thou wilt abide with me, soft laughter From morning until even, and delight That thou hast little dreamed about, my knight, Is ours, and, careless what may come hereafter, But as the wind a creaking loosened rafter Shakes gently, shall the World our quiet smite.” Such was the song she sang to me Beneath the listening silent tree. The leaves left fluttering as she sang: My heartstrings so responsive rang Dead I had been content to be. II. This is the song she sang to me, Upon the sand, beside the sea, That dreamy burnished autumn noon When, like a sleeper in a swoon, I, languid, rested next her knee. “Peace, love, and listen to a soothing ditty That I will sing to thee, and close thine eyes And ponder all things slumbrous—sunset skies, Long shores at nightfall, or some Arab city Wherein myself shall find thee and take pity And be thy good magician. Come, be wise! “For what is fame, and crowns of glory, golden Or green or grey or coloured otherways, The warrior's laurel or the poet's bays? Why shouldst thou be to any man beholden, Once having known sweet lips that wax not olden, Feet having trodden once Love's mystic maze? “I sing to thee, and hath my voice no power To send the hot blood round thy forehead fair, And art thou not enamoured of my hair? See, I will give thee, sweet one, even this flower, If thou wilt tarry with me in my bower, This rose that I have been content to wear.” Such was the song she sang to me Beside the rippling of the sea. Their voices mingled passing sweet And bound a chain about my feet, And glad was I in prison to be. III. This is the song she sang to me, Upon the cliff, above the sea, That blue delightful summer morn. Along its eddies I was borne Wrapped in a silent ecstasy. “Rest thou, and I will shield thee and caress thee. Thou shalt not need to wander any more Along the barren sad sun-stricken shore, Nor unto weary labour to address thee, For I am thine, and here am I to bless thee: Thou hast love, what hast thou to do with war? “Thou hast not heard me sing before, my simple Strong hero with the iron arms and heart: If thou wilt stay with me and not depart, I will let loose my hair, cast off my wimple, And singing, honey-sweet, shall surely dimple The airs, and I will use my mystic art “To soothe thee, and to lull thee, and to prove thee Whether thou art a lover true indeed. Thou hast been strong to struggle and to bleed Wearing my colours,—listen, doth this move thee? Or must my lips make plainer that I love thee? I thought my eyes had left them little need.” Such was the song she sang to me In that green nook above the sea. The sun was softened, for her face Stole all his fire and added grace, And as the sun she seemed to be. 1870. IN THE PAST My love is waiting in the past, And I, I cannot go to her: My eyes are closed, my lips are fast; Between us comes a shadow vast And interposes arms of air. Ah, love, if I could get to you, If I could break the bands of life, And bring by death your face in view, And things that used to be renew, How I would kiss the keen-edged knife! How I would run to meet King Death, And fall upon his icy breast, And hug each single word he saith,— If only we might mingle breath, And in his arms together rest! 1870. THE AGONY OF THE AGE What Power shall set us free? The winds are free; The waters rise and fall for very gladness; The evening pang, the shadow of sunset sadness At morning advent fades in infinite glee: The leaves pass kisses on from tree to tree; The summer brings a sound of happy lovers, An everlasting tunefulness that hovers High on the hills, and shines upon the sea. The universe is happiness—but we, Striving in vain to tear away the chains That circle us, the more acutely see Our own consuming atmosphere of pains, Long only the more maddeningly to flee, The more triumphantly the sunshine reigns Without us,—the more ecstasy in the sky, The more would we weave wings for us and fly; But back we sink exhausted on the plains. 1870. EARLY SONNETS “THEIR WHITE SAILS FILL THE PURPLE AND THE SOMBRE SEAS!” (Moncure Conway.) I. “The purple seas!” and through the misty mountains Flutter the first advances of their feet; And through deep forests, and in openings sweet, By many flower-spotted glades and fountains, They press straight forward, stedfast, as is meet: A youthful band with foreheads wrinkled, aged With fervent thoughts with which they have engaged, Yet having Youth's fair footsteps strong and fleet. I saw them, and my soul was very glad, And burst into a rosy shout of song, And scattered scented petals on the throng, Ready to kiss the lips that seeméd sad, Ready to weep for sorrows each had had, And smile for crowns that each should wear ere long! II. They are leaving fast the ancient standing-places, The altars and the churches and the creeds, And for each drop from every heart that bleeds Blossom a hundred flowers, a hundred graces! I watched them,—and a light was on their faces Even such that star nor sunshine any needs: A light that leads the way to burning deeds And sets a hero running stalwart races. These are the founders of the future; they Have set against their losses a great gain, Nor caréd any longer to remain Bowing beneath a dome of carven clay, And therefore must they emigrate to day Through penury and solitude and pain. 1871. THE PASSIONATE CITY To feel the passionate city throb and flow Throughout one, every street and every soul, The power of the blood that sways the whole, Its agony of yearning and of woe, And great unutterable fervent glow Of gladness leaping forward past control— This is to sip the nectar of a bowl A giant might be jubilant to know! Yet over and above I have a sense Of Beauty, of my Lady, over all Supreme, and in a solitude intense Yet peopled with creation, I can call Most close upon her, leaping every wall Of separation, each dividing fence. 1871. THE NEW JERUSALEM I. In common with humanity I sought A New Jerusalem with golden floors, And diamond-studded opal-handled doors, And held our grimy earth for less than nought: Some echo of the melody I thought That through the pearly gates incessant pours, A soft suggested hint of heavenly oars On crystal streams, attentive ears had caught. But now the vision fadeth, and instead I find my longed-for city very clear In spite of London fog before me here, And here a crown, it may be, for my head Of truer import than the splendours shed On saints by former creeds accounted dear. II. No city sent from heaven as a bride Is mine, but poor, and needing the attire That I may weave for her in songs of fire Before she can be unto love allied, Meet for a hero's and a husband's side, Able towards her own sunset to aspire. I found her draggled, slip-shod, in the mire, Her pure potential sovereignty denied, And vowed myself to raise her; therefore I, Brought down from Isis unto where the Thames For many an arch her stately descent stems, Will celebrate my London till I die, If haply o'er her head without a sigh Some day may flame the sunset diadems. III. I may not be her champion unless I prove my worth in heat of sorest fight. Oh! I would suffer with her through the night, And share her agony and great distress, And sober crape-embroidered mourning dress, If so I might partake her bridal bright, And when she riseth, clothed in power and white, She might acknowledge me with one caress! Sweet city, take me; here am I, not strong As some men count strength,—yet I love thee well, And hand in hand with thee will traverse hell, And penetrate the utmost realms of wrong, That so the road to heaven in my song And purity I may be meet to tell. 1871. THE CHOICE I. Two women stood before me, and I heard A voice that said, “Look well, consider, choose.” The one wore dainty feet in golden shoes, And head made bright with plumes of tropic bird, And written on her brow that who preferred To dwell with her in heaven should straightway lose The sound of earth's distress; in quiet hues The other clad, my heart the sooner stirred, For in her I was swift to recognise My pale sweet city, and she looked to me With mute appealing in her stricken eyes, And, brushing Paradise aside, “I see,” Said I, “my Lady in this lowly guise; My choice is made already,—I love thee.” II. Then Paradise was angry, and she turned With a majestic tossing of her head. Not through those golden gates shall I be led: No home for me in that high city spurned, Nor choice amid the costly tapers burned That round about sweet wealth of incense shed, Nor any cunning cloak of white or red, Nor harp for which my former spirit yearned. But, hearken all, for here is my reward: In that I took the lowly for my bride, The humble present, she hath made me lord Of many a future season's pomp and pride, And made me master of her keen-edged sword Of song, to wear in triumph at my side. III. In that I let the lyres and lutestrings go, Enamoured of no beatific strain, And here elected, stedfast, to remain Where tides of silver Thames do ebb and flow, For recompence I have been given to know The beauty of the bud within the pain We suffer, that the weary London rain Shall bring to bloom at last, as white as snow. I sacrificed the past, and I behold A present greater,—let the future wait, And left my lyre beside the city gate For an obliging rose-winged saint to hold, And lo! no organ now but doth unfold Dreams far too golden-glorious to relate. 1871. THE CROWNLESS CITY Not Florence, nor the Baian bay, I sing, Nor sunny vine-clad slopes of southern France Nor gardens where the Spanish maidens dance With laughter in a white-armed starry ring, Not unto Palestine, nor Greece, I cling, As many with a longing backward glance,— Through London's flowerless gloom my steps advance, The crownless city seeks a crownless king. Mine are the suns of morning, looming red Through misery and smoke, till gleams of blue, Occasional at midday, glisten through, Across our patient care-worn foreheads shed: Mine is the sorrow,—mine the imperial head, The sinless locks, of London born anew. 1871. THE SUNSET-SHIELD Fear not, my poet brothers,—Beauty guards With shield of sunset and with waving wings The self-forgetful soul of him that sings, And draws a charméd circle round her bards. Tradition your development retards: Burst bands of custom, wander forth alone, Subdue the nations, make the earth a throne, Shake falsehood as one shakes a house of cards. Some higher work the world's a right to ask Than floods of flowery diction, rivers of rhyme: Expression, after all, is but a mask Concealing some reality sublime; Assert your birth-right, bend ye to your task, Inheritors of history, heirs of time. 1870. THE POET He is fallen, the poet, from his high estate. How he hath fallen, God knows, and only God. The high ethereal stairs he would have trod Have vanished from beneath his feet of late, And he is vanquished by uneasy fate, And sinks upon a damp inferior sod, And, mournful, breaks his sweet divining rod, And sighs a broken-hearted sad “Too late!” Ah, God, make poets not, or make them wise, Girded with power to accomplish their high ends. Thou givest them that fire within their eyes That flush of songfulness,—and why should one Whose force from first to last on thee depends, While dawn still glimmers, lose faith in the sun? 1870. TO RALPH WALDO EMERSON, OUR LEADER Great prophet of the West! I hardly know How to express the reverence that I feel, The thousand thoughts that through my spirit steal. Your words are living words,—they flicker and flow, Dance phantom-dances, vanish, come and go: To brain at once and spirit they appeal. Though temples totter and pale churches reel, You and the stars pace calmly to and fro. This one thing I will say that to my mind Your rounded periods are always new, A something fresh invariably I find, Although by heart I thought the words I knew The words themselves remain so deeply true One feels as if before one had been blind. 1870. IN MEMORY OF PATRICK BRANWELL BRONTË, GENIUS I pay a sorrowful tribute to the sun Of genius overcast, and downward hurled,— Its flag no sooner hoisted than 'twas furled, Its flame no sooner kindled than 'twas done, Its race no sooner started than 'twas run, And love no sooner tasted than 'twas sour, And fruit of beauty faded with the flower, Great things attempted, yet how little won. A poor pale finger-post he seems to stand, Saying to men that follow in his wake, “In front of me there lies a lonely land. One of two courses, brothers, you must take: Either for emptiness yourself forsake, Or hold your whole self in tenacious hand.” 1870. ON LOOKING AT A PORTRAIT OF CHARLOTTE BRONTË, BY RICHMOND Wonderful eyes! a leaping fire behind Burns, and at seasons flames the face-veil through; As burst their cloudy curtain gleams of blue When, on a sudden, lo! the sun has shined. Passion and strong repression-power combined I see before me,—and a depth as well That but a hint of what it had to tell Has cast upon the surface of her mind. They are not easy natures, these, to grasp Complete in comprehension, nor do they Hold their own power circled in a clasp. They only see the fruit from day to day That ripens, and abstruser find themselves Than any book they have upon their shelves. 1870. GOOD-NIGHT! Good-night, my hero! I shall dream of you— Ah me, how I do love the eventide, And shadows that across the surface ride Of the lawn! when you were absent, soldier true, I heard your voice in every breeze that blew, And used to shudder at a noise of nights, And tremble, silly one, at simple sights: But, now you're here, sweet, everything is new. I love the lawn that dreary seemed before; The very moths and bats are friendly things And seem to wave a greeting in their wings, And noises of the night alarm no more. The sorrow and the loneliness is o'er: A maiden wept once,—now behold she sings! 1870. WRITTEN AFTER AN APPARENT FRENCH VICTORY A victory at last! and over France There runs a sound as of a sudden sigh, A low tumultuous inarticulate cry, As when one wakeneth with a startled glance While yet the fiends of some dream-vision dance, Retaining devilish might to terrify, Across his brain, and meets the quiet eye Of watchful woman, sees her steps advance. And, as he sigheth low for sheer relief, And longeth for the cool clear lips of day, So with one victory vanisheth away From France the nervous nightmare of her grief, And, by the bedside, stands her chosen chief— The young Republic—in the morning grey. 1870. DEATH OF A FLY A fly has just achieved a piteous fate Before me, slaughtered in a candle-flame. He has fulfilled, no doubt, his being's aim, And won possession by the fiery gate Of martyrdom of joys that may await In paradise the flies of noble name. At all events he has not come to shame, That I am sure of, nor has cause to rate The universal justice; if he had, Arms of protesting we would run to take And go to war with Heaven for the sake Of one poor fly—for then the whole were bad, And Beauty clothed in sackcloth would be sad For the infliction of a single needless ache! 1870. GOD'S NOVEL God's novels all end well! who does not know The trembling passionate turning of the pages Of some sweet story, as the varied stages Proceed through interchange of joy and woe? This world of ours is fashioned even so, Save that, although all eyelashes are wet, The wiping of the tears we see not yet, The lines that stand the last ones in the row. But as the “Happy Marriage” in the play Makes each content and every reader sigh With long-delayed relief, so some glad day, Some season of deliverance by and bye, The “Bridal of the World” shall flutter nigh, And sorrow's wings as surely flee away. 1870. THE RAINBOW CAUGHT AND HELD Love is not love that cannot stand and say, “What I have suffered I would bear again And ten times more, if so the slightest pain From finger-tip of thine to soothe away I might be able, pleasure to convey In tiniest crimson tingle of a vein: Yea, sweetheart, stony-hearted would remain Unloved, unkissed, for ever and a day, If so the Beauty might be nearer brought That I have seen between the palms of dreams.” Till we are one with our ideal gleams, And bear upon our brows the rainbow sought By snatching baffled hands of eager thought, Apart from us somehow our passion seems. 1871. THE POET'S CROWN First over him my Lady placed a hand White as a lily in a moonlit lane, And passed a perfume over him for pain, And bound about his brow a linen band, And folding of it with her breath she fanned That tight and tenderly it might remain, And with her hair she cleanséd every stain Of blood and weariness, and, after, spanned His forehead with the bays, and, after this, When he could only weep, and, weeping, sigh “O God, my Mother, thou hast sent me bliss Too great to bear alive, so I must die,” To his lips shuddering were her own brought nigh In sweetest condescension of a kiss. 1871. THE UNIVERSE-BRIDE In strange deep fashion God himself bestows Creation as a spotless bride on each, And, pale with coming pleasure beyond speech, Himself unrobes her shoulder as the snows, Himself unveils the countenance that glows As moonlight cast across an August beach, Or as the golden tremulous streams that reach The shore, when sunset's beaker overflows. “Is she not beautiful?” he says, and stands Watching the eager glances of the boy For whom this ivory sweet-shapen toy He fashioned into life between his hands, And wove her hair in silken subtlest strands, And chose a marble block without alloy. “Is she not beautiful, this marble maid Creation, with her rivers and her stars, And fiery-tinted azure-circled cars, And palms that canopy a perfect shade? Come, touch her hair, be daring,—not a braid But hath the perfume of the western seas: Sweet savours as of cinnamon in these I tenderly invented and conveyed. O thou that hast her, see thou hold her fast, She is Infinite before thee; not for time, For endless aspiration of a rhyme That trembles not at death's bleak-biting blast, For issue of a trumpet-volume vast Of Song, for valour of long steps to climb, “I give her to thee; see thou hold her fair With most chaste pressure of most perfect hands, Lest lips should shrivel as they kiss the bands Of beautiful exuberance of hair: Believe me, brother, such a bride is rare, That marble-bodied Universe that stands Before thee,—and green eloquence of lands, And flowers tropical she can prepare. And she can crown thee; not with any bays Of earth, poor pointed dark-hued sorry leaves, But with the pressure of immediate praise Of lips, and every arrow-hilt that grieves Thy soul she can extract,—she sits and weaves The golden chains of everlasting lays. “Is she not beautiful? her body fair I chiselled far away before the earth Came as an infant to primeval birth, And plumes of Paradise-birds to form her hair Were ready, and of tender lashes rare Of soft-eyed stags there was not any dearth, And many spirits moulded I in mirth One perfect after-spirit to prepare. My eye was on this meeting from afar, And hidden in the green of forest leaves, Or under shadows of the golden sheaves No hand of man had gathered, this sweet star I chose for you, of all the suns that are Strung upon heaven's bright blue nodding eaves “Like swallows' nests beneath a roof; this sight, This vision of the Universe for you, This sweet dividing of the veil of blue, That so thou mightest adore a Goddess white, This soft uplifting of her lashes bright To give thy vehemence a long first view, This glory that for ever shall renew The God-sent magic of the nuptial night: This perfect pure enfolding of chaste arms, And breath of roses heavy on the air, And delicate unbinding of her hair, And golden palace of perpetual charms, And swift transition from life's lone alarms To peace in bowers unutterably fair.” 1871. THE SOUL The soul shall burst her fetters At last, and shall be As the stars, as the wind, as the night, As the sun, as the sea. The soul shall struggle and stand In the end swift and free As the stars, as the wind, as the night, As the sun, as the sea. The soul shall be crowned and calm, Eyes fearless—and she Shall be queen of the wind and the night, Stars, sun, and the sea. 1871. TWO SONNETS I. THE STORM OF BEAUTY At times my lady seizes me and flings Her arms around mine unreluctant form And wraps me for a season in the storm, The thunder of the closing of her wings, And I am as some white glad bird that clings Against a purple cloud-breast, and I weep, And strive with shuddering fainting hands to keep That vision of unutterable things. For she bends over me as some pure cloud, And I am as a flower that will dare, Being supremely weak, to face the air That hangs above it as a sweet dim shroud; Next, my strained body sobs with yearning, bowed Beneath the fragrant tempest of her hair. II. THE INEFFABLE FRAGRANCE She sweeps across me like a fragrant wind Laden with summer and a thousand fruits, And countless messages of springing shoots, Even as a gentle woman being blind, But bearing in her bosom every kind Of flower, and coloured leaf, and unctuous roots; And as a fervent noise of answering lutes Is the Æolian response of my mind Blown by her spirit into endless song, Hot with the sense of summer she conveys From cornfields over which her hand delays To gather fragrance as she sweeps along, One with the winds and scents and sounds that throng The odorous woods and hills on summer days. 1871. SONNET To F. B. Is all the world against thee? Then am I Quite for thee, though I bitterly condemn The sin that justifies their spite to them, And drains the wells of thy fair spirit dry. It is an English poet's part to die For English womanhood at utter need: My spirit, all on fire to intercede For thy bruised spirit, hovers gently nigh. What is it worth, the gift of praise men bring To me the poet, while thou art in grief? Lo! for thy sake I tear my laurel-leaf And hush to solemn notes the lips that sing. May God forgive me for those shameful hours, When thou wast crowned with thorns, and I with flowers! July, 1876. SONNETS TO GERTRUDE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD (1878) GERTRUDE Help me, sweet spirit, in this my song of thee. Shine gently on me with thy spirit-face; Lift me in singing to some lofty place Wherein thine utter beauty I may see. Grant me a lyre of radiant purity: Kiss me,—and let thy mouth, a glorious flower, Once having touched mine, gift it with new power; Stoop from thine heaven where I shall one day be. I see thee not; but thy sweet touch at times Lifts me, as towards glad sight of holier lands, New flowerful forests of soft spirit-climes, Wherein the whitest blossoms are thine hands: One day thine eyes shall, like the morning, break Upon me, and my lifelong fever slake. WHAT ART THOU LIKE? What art thou like, sweet lady mine, I wonder? Kind friends have spoken—but of no avail I find their earthly and much hindered tale Which this world's mortal weakness breaks in sunder. Oh, art thou rose-flushed, love,—or art thou pale? Oh, dwellest thou beyond all seas, all thunder, Or rose-built bowers of endless brilliance under, Soft haunts that no fierce storm-winged blasts assail? Lift up thy light of eyes upon me, sweet! Oh, are they hazel orbs, or are they brown? Or blue or grey—and flow thy tresses down In one rich auburn torrent to thy feet? Or are thine eyes of some unearthly hue, And locks diviner than e'en Raphael drew? THOU IN HEAVEN, I ON EARTH Make thou me great in heaven, I on earth Will make thee deathless and abiding, sweet. Tender shall be the flower-marks of thy feet In every valley; give the heavenly birth To me, and let me when I kiss thee, meet Lips past all mortal evanescent worth. Oh, lift me far beyond the thunderous heat Of life, and let me hear celestial mirth. A mortal I: a crownéd angel thou: Yet have I strength to draw thee down the ways Golden, and print this kiss upon thy brow. Lo! all my spirit towards thee to-night I raise: Deathless thou shalt be in mine earthly song; Convoy thou me thine heavenly streets along! MUTUAL Thus shall there be a mutual sweet reward. O Gertrude, lady, lean above me now The while I write—thy face above me bow— Let all thy wondrous loving soul be poured Above me and about me: I am lord, Though mortal, of thine heart—I know not how It came to pass—and therefore let me vow Sweetest allegiance both of harp and sword! I will be sacred husband-spirit to thee, King-spirit, singing spirit if thou wilt; Cleanse me by thy sweet kiss from pain, from guilt, Lift me from weakness into purity:— I upon earth will make thy name a power, Set thee 'mong women as their stateliest flower. THE MYSTERY The mystery is half the beauty, sweet. Thou art no mortal woman, and I know Only thy spirit-touch, and wonder so What fashion of sweet face I have to meet One day, what bosom whiter than white snow! Softer thou art, I doubt not, than the loves Of earth, though these be tender-wingéd doves; More exquisite thy touch in passionate glow. Art thou a rose of women or a lily? And is thy voice more tuneful than a lute? Art thou as white flowers that in earth's wild hilly Regions towards mountain airs their tendrils shoot? I care not what thou art: I feel thy touch Upon me, raising high, bestowing much. WILT THOU BE PLEASED? Wilt thou be pleased, fair Gertrude, with my song? Shall I pursuing thee, behold the flush Of pleasure on thy cheeks—mark that soft blush Which tells a mortal bard that love is strong? Thou art an Angel; art thou Woman too? As thou dost pass the pearl-paved streets along Will some sweet echo in thine ears renew These rhythmic thoughts that now around thee throng? Oh, lady, put thy dear face down to mine To-night from heaven—so—now let me, love, Within thy wonderful soft tresses twine This rose of song—so—carry it above, Be not ashamed: to-morrow in the height Of heaven that rose shall whisper of to-night. I FOLLOW THEE I follow thee, and all thy soft hair waves, Loosened, before me, drawing with delight My spirit towards thy spirit. Through the night I follow: on one side death's ocean raves, And on the other hollow leagues of graves Do their sad mocking utmost to affright; But fearless, sweet, I tread behind thy white Dear figure, which uplifts and soothes and saves. O white dear body of mine heavenly lady, Shining alone beneath these awful stars, The one supreme sweet comfort in the shady Dim valley, where death sits with sword that mars— I follow, follow, follow; I shall rest, Risen from the dead, upon thy very breast. BACK TO THEE Back, Gertrude, back to thee my spirit doth come. After long weary days of common things, Again thy fair abode on gladdened wings I seek: my restful and eternal home. Again our passion suns itself and sings Beneath the blue of heaven's loftiest dome; I must return, however far I roam, For all thy mystic power about me clings. Weary with labour, and misunderstood Of all I meet, sweet lady, unto thee I come: divinely sweet, divinely good Thou art. Oh, bear my burden, set me free From all the dreary daily common round: Touch me with flower-sweet lips—lo! I am crowned. THINE HAIR AND THINE EYES I see thine hair is auburn, and thine eyes Hazel; thou art not timid now—thou lettest My glad foot nearer tread to thee—forgettest My first entrancement and thy first surprise That unto thee a mortal's vows dared rise. Now can I see thee close; ah, love, thou settest Strange value on my fealty, nor regrettest The encrimsoned flush of amorous heavenly skies. I see thine hair is auburn—I was right In the first instinct of my deep sweet dream; I see thine eyes are tender, hazel-bright, Lovely besides with many a laughing gleam Of delicate thought that spirits may not see, Open to mortal, so immortal, me. AM I JEALOUS? Oh, am I jealous of thy spirit-friends? Is there some angel clothed in glittering mail Before whom mortal love must e'en turn pale, And at the sight of whom our passion ends? When over me the lovely vision bends Of thy sweet face, is it of no avail? Have I the angelic phalanx to assail (I fear it not), whom my bold thought offends? Oh, let them, when they see thee pass along Their winged ranks, quitting me at early morn, Mark all thy bright face flushing from my song, And thy lips trembling—in that thou art torn From one who, mortal, held thee through the night Of love with more than their celestial might. A LOVE-TOKEN Wear thou this rose I give thee, through the day. Then when thou dost return to spirit-land Still shalt thou carry, burning from my hand A sweet love-token; let it not wax grey Nor wither—let it flame along the way, That whoso meeteth thee may understand That thou art wedded, that thy breath hath fanned My face, that o'er mine eyes thy locks did stray. Those loosened locks of delicate bright gold, Gold in the sunbeams, chestnut in the dusk, Smelling of rose and lily, myrrh and musk, Which, laughing softly, to my lips I hold, When thou dost, trembling softly, them unbind To ravish soul and body, heart and mind! A SUMMER NIGHT Oh, all one summer night is in thine hair! Sweet, leave it so; let all its beauty lie About me; let me drink the rapture dry. Oh, all the odours of the summer air Here rest; there is not any blossom fair That blooms beneath this summer-soft deep sky Which doth not all its tenderest scent supply To give thy locks a glory yet more rare. Oh, I am breathing odours not of earth, And wrapt in fragrances of starry lands, And lifted towards some spiritual new birth! Thy beauty, like the summer night, expands Around me and before me; lo! thine eyes Are stars, thine outpoured tresses are the skies. THOU ART THE SUMMER O love, thou art the summer; thy sweet breast Is summer in its softest tenderest glow:— Oh, what are lilies to thy neck of snow? The bosom wherein all my pain I rest, Soothed past all speaking, infinitely blest! Delivered now from every dart of woe And tribulation:—yea, sweet, kiss me so— Now blush again, shaming the blushing west! Thou art the summer; mine eternal rose Thou art of heavenly summers yet unseen. Bear thou thy love-soft sceptre, O my queen! Thy more than regal beauty now disclose; Sway all my pulses with imperial sway, A white moon moving my heart's tidal way. THY KISS I carry, sweet, thy kiss upon my lips, When the glad night is over and the morn In laughing chariot o'er flushed hills is borne; When the fierce sun love's moonbeams doth eclipse. Though we are, then, from one another torn In sorrow, yet throughout the yearning day Thy face is with me, like a silvery ray Of lingering moonlight, cheering me forlorn. If thou dost carry through the heavenly streets My song like a red rose within thine hair, Oh, like a white rose thy sweet kiss is fair, Flower-soft, flower-pure upon me, nor retreats: Within my memory all the wondrous night Abides, and floodeth me with fresh delight. THE TRYST I am as one who hath a trysting place Appointed—who throughout the weary day Ever for stars of eventide doth pray, Well knowing then that he shall see her face, And laugh for rapture at her woman-grace As she advances underneath the grey Of early dusk to meet him in the way; Knowing how every pain her smile shall chase. So is it with me: I am waiting not For any mortal woman—but a queen, Lovely, eternal, blossom-white, serene. Lo! in some calm fern-shaded heavenly grot She waiteth, kisseth, crowneth; spirit indeed, Yet woman when I, urgent, win love's meed. A SPIRIT WOMAN For all her passion is the stronger now That she hath stepped, a disembodied thing, Forth from her robe of earth, with snow-white wing Seeking far seas that heaven's breezes plough: Nobler she is, diviner is her brow, Clearer her voice the eternal chant to sing; Yet is sweet passion a more forceful king Than ever, urging swift his pinnace-prow. Lo! passion's bark comes surging through the seas, Fair Gertrude, tender Gertrude, seeking rest, Urged by the pressure of the barren breeze, Drawn by the scents of summer in thy breast. Thou standest, sweet one, on the cliffs afar, Watching us furrow the fierce harbour-bar. THE HARBOUR And, having crossed the foaming harbour-bar, Thou art the placid harbour, safe within: Oh outside now is all the waters' din, And outside now the thundering breakers are. Lo! pleasure and a calm abode we win: In pale-green sky glimmers the evening star. Over the steel-grey waste where we have been Rises divine the white moon's pearly car. Thou art the perfect harbour, sweet Gertrude, Within whose limits we may dream of rest, Forgetting all the winds and waters rude, Lulled softly by the heart-beat in thy breast, That tide which hurts not, but which lifts the head Gently and woos it to sweet sleep instead. THE HAYFIELDS ON THE CLIFF-TOP Just as the hayfields on the cliff-top draw Seafarers—yea, two miles away from land! Bringing sweet thoughts of many a leafy strand, Making more hateful the fierce wind and raw That smites those barren furrows which they plough; Just as the scent of hayfields makes the hand Tremble upon the oar, the heart crave now For fields where flowers and grass-blades do expand:— So, Gertrude, far away thou drawest me From life and labour, and their scentless sea; Sweeter than hayfields is thy spirit-breath Which, loved one, lures me through the gulfs of death; More wonderful the magic of thine eyes, Convulsed at sight of which life swoons and dies. SWEET PASSIONATE SPIRIT Spirit thou art, yet not beyond the reach Of passion—yea, more passionate because Not bound nor subject to dull earthly laws, Nor limited by earthly feeble speech. Sweet passionate spirit! in my song I teach The great grand truth that spirit-high desire To earthly longing is as potent fire To smouldering flame, that death transfigures each. O Gertrude, just because thou art a saint, A disembodied spirit, a queen indeed, With love of thy dear soul I yearn, I faint, My feet upon the flints, pursuing, bleed: Sweet loving spirit! from heaven I bring thee down, To aid my labour, and bestow its crown. THE RACE What, heavenly Atalanta, wouldst thou race With me thy mortal love, Milanion? Upon the long course have thy white feet shone? Do the spectators mark thy flushing face As thou and I stand, each in proper place, Ere yet the signal sounds, and we are gone! O Atalanta, thy closed lips are wan With this the coming struggle, and embrace. Worsted, like Atalanta, in the race, Surely thou shalt be. Am I mortal bard? Yet, love, the panting flight with me is hard! The unaccustomed sweat shall mar thy face If thou dost tempt a trial, sweet, with me Of feet or plumes—though thine unearthly be! TOGETHER Give me thine hand, and we will run together, Not struggling each with each, but rather now United—cutting with one golden prow Of mutual vessel through the wild black weather The flying foam; thou needest me, I vow! Thou art alone in heaven without my song. For what, oh tell me, is that voiceless throng Of angels to thee? Can they crown thy brow? Oh, I will give thee all the flowers of earth, “Snowdrops and harebells,” which thy sister here Doth tell me unto thee are chiefly dear; And I will seek the spots where spring to birth Violets amid the moss—give thou to me Sweet Snowdrop, thine own flower-white purity! SNOWDROP So Snowdrop is thy name! then art thou white As snowdrops? here on earth a violet Ever for me with dewy tears is wet; Oh, tarriest thou within the heavenly light For me, a snowdrop delicate and bright? Keep thou for me thy whiteness till I climb Slowly towards thine own mountain-tops sublime, Till the dread final ascent looms in sight. And then, when that is conquered, step thou down, And open all thy whiteness unto me! Oh, blossom, tender Snowdrop—be my crown! Let me thy passionate woman-splendour see! Thy woman-splendour; blossom-splendour too, And spirit-splendour: heart-absorbing, new. OTHERS LOVE MORTAL WOMEN, I A SPIRIT Others love mortal women—as for me, Weary I am of mortals, though their eyes Be bluer than the deep Italian skies, Or lovelier than the grey-toned English sea, Or blacker than that night wherein there lies The endless sweet unspoken witchery. Weary I am; my longing upward flies, And, in my wandering, I encounter—thee! Others woo mortal women—I a ghost Soft, playful, peerless, tender, snowdrop-white; Sweeter she is than all the rose-lipped host Of living queens of amorous delight: Once having touched this high angelic flower, Earth's most alluring loves have little power. THY LAUGHTER O love, there is a laughter on thy tongue, Sweeter than music, tenderer than sighs, Softer than love's low questions and replies, Purer than when a nightingale hath sung! Lo! yesternight how soft the cadence rung! O love, there is a laughter in thine eyes, Though thou art angel, when thy swift glance flies Towards me; thy lips laugh, honeysuckle-hung. Thy laughter hath a magic silver-sweet, A ripple of soft unearthly luring sound; How gently falls thy foot upon the ground, And oh how tender is thine own heart-beat When next to mine the tides in unison Rush first together, then, more softly, on. SPIRIT-WOOING Will there be wooing of thee, as below? Must thou be sought for, eagerly pursued, Followed through many a wayward woman's mood, Pierced with love's arrows—sometimes plunged in woe? Then lifted up more passionate heights to know? Is this the story of our love, Gertrude? Must even spirit-passion have its food Of coy reluctance, coldness, fiercer glow? Oh, kiss me, sweet, and turn aside thy face, Thy dear face, laughing—woman art thou yet, Though on thine auburn locks the crown be set Eternal, and heaven's sun smile on thy grace: Yet woman art thou. I will not pursue Swiftly, lest thy foot crave the racecourse too! WHAT MATTERS IT? What matters it if I throughout the day Be plagued by common faces, dreary things? At nightfall lo! the folding of thy wings; At eventide thy footstep on the way. The holy dusk thine holier advent brings, Gertrude, my spirit-queen whom I obey: Then of itself my harp awakes and sings, And forth the golden sweet dream-fancies stray. O sacred lady, past all passion mine, Yea, past all earthly yearning, all desire, Hear thou the aspiration of my lyre: Disdain not this rose-wreath that I would twine Softly for thee; oh twist it in thine hair, Making rich clustered blossoms yet more fair. UPON EARTH What wast thou upon earth, O lovely queen Of all my spirit—oh, was thine earth-life fair? Yea, wanderedst thou in some soft southern air, Floating o'er blue Italian tides serene? Or didst thou tread the early grasses green Of England; wast thou Iseult or the rare Splendour of Guinevere; or didst thou wear Some Eastern garb, magnificent of mien? Oh, where wast thou, sweet lady—what wast thou? Where in the years aforetime did thy foot Linger? (yea, sweetest, where, where art thou now? What hills celestial still defy pursuit?) Who kissed thee, who caressed thee? Didst thou rest On some untender irresponsive breast? NOW Now, now thou art my own, whate'er thy past. Whether thou hast been queen to Eastern kings, Or cherished spirits with thy snow-soft wings For ages, or endured the icy blast Of loveless lingering years:—I call thee—cast Aside thy golden robes, thy wedding rings, Lean towards thy poet who aspires and sings; Find in my bosom changeless peace at last. Gertrude thy final name is—this thou art To me, whate'er to others thou hast been; I claim thy beauty, and will rule thy heart: Lo! sweet one, I the imperial whiteness win Which thou hast kept untainted through long lives, Stored like deep honey, in tenderest passion-hives. THE TREASURES OF ALL THY PAST Bring thou to me the treasures of thy past, Sweet maiden spotless spirit—bring to me Savours of blossoms from thy southern sea; Flower-petals scattered by thy northern blast. Thy robe of endless life around me cast! Oh make me one in thy divine abode With every sweet land where thy foot has glowed; Count all thy loves up: this love is the last! I lift not back, when I put down my hand. Thou art mine own now,—tenderly display Wreaths woven for thee in a former day In palaces, perhaps, that over sand Hot, grassless, limitless, glared from their panes, Splendid in colour, dyed with Tyrian stains. A MAIDEN SPIRIT In spite of all thy lives, maiden thou art For him who hath the soul to understand. Ringless thy finger is: unkissed thine hand: Spotless the untouched beauty of thine heart. Now we have met, sweet love, we shall not part. Make me the lord of immemorial land Wherein thou hast had thy treasures; flowers expand With thee that shine not now in vale or mart. They are the blossoms of a former world, By thy sweet power made manifest to me: Oh, the great wondrous calm white petals curled So softly and so smoothly that I see! Unfold them, lady,—and thyself unfold, That I may reach thy blossom-heart of gold! WITH SUMMER With summer come, sweet spirit of my dream! Thou art a flower of heaven: now flowers awake, Be thou on earth a blossom for my sake, Let blossom-wings of beauty round me gleam. Oh, through the summer nights when lone hearts ache, When o'er earth's solitary spirits stream Legions of devious fancies, do thou take My heart to heaven on bright love's rainbow-beam. Be with me through the sacred summer nights, A marvellous joy, a bounty in the air, Thyself both giver of supreme delights, And the supremest, most surpassing fair: When sinks the dusk o'er mountain, lake, and sea, Thou white-winged spirit of love, descend on me! BEAR THOU MY POEMS UPWARD Bear thou my poems upward: if on earth Few sympathise, yet fewer understand, Gift me with laurels from another land, Crown me with crowns of sweeter nobler worth. Oh take my labour, Gertrude, in thy hand, And bear it upward through the silent night Towards love's own unapproachable clear light: The utmost heavens part at thy command! Take thou my singing through the golden gates, Unclose all barriers, yea unbar the tomb, Let thy white pinions shine athwart death's gloom. My spirit pauses not, nor hesitates At death or sorrow, labour or the fray; Lift me beyond life's night-time into day. SHALL NOT THE FUTURE? Shall not the future listen to this strain Of thee the spirit-woman, loved by me? Shall not our music sound beside the sea Of life, long after we are no more twain, But one in death's inseparable domain? Shall not they wonder at thy purity Of dazzling wings, and neck without a stain? Shall not thy laughter mix with girlhood's glee? Oh, let it be so—let the future know Thy spirit-beauty: let the rose unborn Copy, Gertrude, thy red lips in the morn, And let thy flying feet, like flakes of snow, Descend upon the unquivering grasses fair; In heaven a white rose, plucked in England, wear. THOU ART NOT ENGLISH Thou art not English: I am bringing thee Towards earth and England, as one brings a bride From foreign lands, across the breezy sea;— Nor art thou of our planet: its blue tide Of ocean, and its plains thou hast descried For the first time now love has brought thee here, To sway my spirit, and be to me most dear, To be my spirit-queen and tender guide. And dost thou wonder at the English seas, Sweet, strange, unknowing spirit—I'll give thy hand To Beatrice, whose cheeks our salt strong breeze From girlhood unto womanhood hath fanned: Oh, guard her, Beatrice; and she shall keep Thy spirit when thou crossest death's dim deep! WILT THOU NOT BE VISIBLE? Oh, canst thou not be visible to me In woman's sweet alluring subtle form? Come with a sound of pinions, a soft storm Of plumage, when the moon is on the sea! Or come at noontide:—or when sleep sets free The wandering fancy—let me hear thy voice, And in its sacred melody rejoice; Wilt thou not grant this, since I yearn for thee? Oh, let our love know deeper sweeter joy Than earth in highest moments e'er can show; Pleasure which fadeth not, which ne'er can cloy; Summer which changeth not to tears and snow: Oh, let me pass into thy changeless life, Sweet spirit-guardian, soul-love, spirit-wife! WHEN ALL THE WORK IS DONE When all the work is done, let me look back On lone heights traversed, moonless oceans ploughed, Dark forests threaded, where a close-knit shroud Of frowning foliage sways across the track; Shores whereupon eternal love I've vowed; Flowers I have twined in maidens' bright-brown hair; Ferns I have twisted into locks as fair; Summers wherein my singing hath been loud. Let me as in one crowning vision see The long toil ended, yea the very whole, The utmost height, the summit, the white goal, And, crowning every crown, white Gertrude, thee Waiting to meet me—smiling a reward In thy dear eyes for strokes of many a sword. ABBEY WOOD I. Bright hill-sides, covered thick with yellow heads Of daffodils—a primrose here and there; The subtle smell of spring-time in the air; A brimstone-plumaged butterfly who speeds On wings ecstatic through the shining meads, As if a flying daffodil it were; A distant prospect sweet beyond compare, Showing the silver Thames amid its reeds: Such was the scene that met our earnest gaze, O Violet, when we rested on the hill, Marking the slow departure of the haze From valley, upland, and meandering rill, A prospect whose pure soothing presence stays Within me as a sunny comfort still. II. I felt the sweet sense of the spring-time steal Throughout me, renovating every nerve; I marked the distant river's every curve And the far echo of a church-bell's peal, As we were making our sequestered meal, With appetites the forest airs did serve: Upon a neighbouring bark with cunning swerve A creeper The bird (Certhia familiaris)—not the plant. climbed and twisted, wheel on wheel. The silence and the pleasure of the place Pervaded us—we could not but be sure That here was manifest the perfect grace Of Beauty, and her bosom soft and pure, And the exceeding grandeur of her face: The eyeless smoke-fed city ceased to allure. THE REVELATIONS OF THE AGES SONNET Strip off dead husks, the fruit will be the sweeter; Shake out dead petals, brighter blooms the rose; Cast off the worn-out shoes, the feet are fleeter, Fitter to race along the road that goes, With many windings, toiling through the ages, Revealing ever newer points of view, Each turn unfolding fresh sweet landscape-pages, And broad descents, and hills and valleys new; Places of which our fathers never dreamed, Strange, perilous, by feet of man untrod, And which to them impassable would have seemed,— But which we have to traverse, trusting God, God who for certain leaves no single age Without its fitting revelation-page. 1870. BROTHER AND SISTER Oh, love, the difference when I met thine eyes! How the sweet sunlight broke through doubtful skies, Upon my heart and on the world's heart shed. How swiftly I forgot thy brother's face, As one forgets a pale white rose's grace When lo! its sister rose of noblest red Smiles with supreme exuberance instead, Flooding with holier fragrance all the place! So was it, lady, when the grey pure eyes First smote me tenderly with quick surprise, For then thou wast in very truth a queen Surpassing page and maid who came before, Crowned with an ecstasy unknown of yore, Fiery with virgin glance as yet unseen,— Touching to golden light the meadows green, Redoubling all the music of the shore. The difference is in the subtle sense That this fair beauty, passionate, intense, May be possessed and won and held by right,— That passion's flush may gather on her face; That hill and mead and river and leafy place Which this day worship all her beauty bright May worship love the conqueror ere the night, When love leads captive their girl-sovereign's grace. LONDON If I must linger like a sluggard here Through many a slothful month and laggard year Till some unknown occasion intervenes, Why, then let English hills be doubly dear: In lieu of foreign countries and new scenes Let me to laughter of our waves give ear And pierce behind our wild woods' bosky screens! Not Italy, nor Greece, do I desire: I care not for the vaunted hoards of Rome: I find my peace and pleasures nearer home, Beside my own lawn, or my own hearth-fire. There is my heart, my hope,—there sounds my lyre; I seek not foreign seas whereon to roam; Beneath our dark calm heavens I can aspire. I journeyed by wild marshes yesterday Where lonely bands of wandering cattle fed, With here and there a straw-stack or a shed, And all the skies were overhung with grey. It was a dismal region,—yet I say Not even here was rapture wholly dead, Nor had triumphant fancy fled away. In that dim waste I seemed to apprehend A spirit present, lordly and as fair As any whose bright leagues of rule extend Through viewless avenues of mountain air Or over slopes where storm-lashed pine-trees bend And, regal, lonely, scorning foe and friend, The golden eagle guards his giddy lair. I find my statues in the London streets, My theme of song in every heart that beats With human joy, or human grief, therein; A picture in each common face one meets Even 'mid the daily dust and nightly din. When through the fog the sun's red ghost retreats I watch the stars their outpost-work begin. It is a prouder thing to be the true Minstrel of England than to sing the blue Italian skies. To sing from sea to sea America the vast and strange and new Would not convey song-pleasure unto me Equal to that which thrills my spirit through When London grasps my lyre with giant glee. “REVEALED AND VANQUISHED” In many a woman all the spirit waits Untouched, unkissed, unconquered, though the bloom Of body many sullen lips consume And many times high passion's flood abates. She yearneth for soft lips beyond the tomb, Beyond the dimly veiled eternal gates,— Trembleth, dissembleth, pants and hesitates, Plucks roses, dreads to smell the fierce perfume. Yet one day comes a lover keen and bold, A head that understands, a heart that yearns: Towards her his ardent strength of being turns; He feels a passion never felt of old. He is as one who, gathering gentle ferns, Wanders along the forest, when behold! Some undiscovered blossom of bright gold Through the dark arches beckons him and burns. And she, she maddens in the kindling air, Her swift foot pants along the vistas green; The still secluded wood-life that has been, That once was sweet, seems past her power to bear. Her eyes flash forth the lightnings of a queen: One quick convulsion, and the soul is there, White, silent, passionate, supremely fair, Revealed and vanquished, never more unseen. TO WOMAN I Not of any wonder High in heaven clear, Soaring beyond thunder, Making for man's ear Music that falls divinely through the azure sheer; II Not of any skylark High in heaven I sing: Loftier than the high lark With my songful wing I would travel, seeking yet a fairer thing. III Fairer thing, and sweeter Than the lark at dawn; Tenderer, completer,— Out of God's heart gone; More silver-voiced than birds, swift-footed as a fawn. IV Glorious in the azure, White above the sea, Man's supremest pleasure, Grand in purity, Woman thou art: and heaven I find, in seeking thee. V Marvellous thy singing; Sweet thy snow-white form Ever to man's clinging, Faithful through each storm, Every surge of anguish, tender still and warm. VI Through the night of trouble, Through thy long sad past, Thou hast sung; now double, Sweet, thy song at last; Sing, for thy night is over, thine enemies downcast. VII Bring to man the gladness That he fain would know; Banish all our sadness; Make an end of woe; Create a perfect heaven amid thy bowers below. VIII Sweet, create God's heaven, Golden, glad, and clear, In earth's valleys even; Yea, love, even here: Bring the divine redemption with thy presence near. IX Be to man a saviour Gentle-souled and white, Sweet in pure behaviour, Glad in modest might; Assert thy woman's sceptre, claim thy queenly right. X Be to earth a blossom Soft, divine indeed; Take man to thy bosom, Man, in utmost need; Give to his endless yearning, gentle lady, heed. XI Build thy bower of roses, Golden, sweet, divine On earth: where love reposes 'Neath ivy and woodbine Build thou thy palace, made imperishably thine. XII Let thy wondrous singing Sound o'er earthly seas; Lo! thy voice is ringing Silver in each breeze Of summer, and amid the green thick-foliaged trees. XIII God in thee revealing All his tender grace Shines; his love is stealing, Love, throughout thy face; Thine hand upon earth's meadows, blossoms in each place. XIV Where thou art, the lily Straightway doth appear; Roses o'er the hilly Rocky fields and sheer Bloom; thou bringest eternal glory, sweetheart, here. XV All my song I render, Lady, unto thee; Worshipping thy splendour, All thy purity: Listening to thy low laughter and thy magic glee. XVI All the bending glory Of the golden corn, Crests of billows hoary, Crimson clouds at morn,— And all earth's countless splendours, for thy sake are born. XVII Not, like Shelley's wonder, Singing in the sky, Not sad thoughts from yonder Bringest thou, sweet, nigh; But only utter gladness laughing in thine eye. XVIII Only utter gladness Sounding in thy voice, Now thy former sadness Letteth thee rejoice, Having fled back for ever, like a tempest-noise. XIX Bring us sweet redemption, Sweet one, in thy breast; Virtue and exemption From the weary quest For what might be more fitting, what the eternal best. XX Thou the eternal best art, Thou the endless queen,— Thou man's perfect rest art, Tender, white, serene, The sweetest of all songsters that have ever been. XXI Sweetest of all singers, Softest of all birds, Flowers within thy fingers, Laughter in thy words; Lo! for thy service now his sword man's spirit girds. XXII Not an angel—fairer; Lovelier, thou art: Not a skylark—rarer; Gifted with a heart Even more full of songs that down the deep blue dart. XXIII All my heart and fire Unto thee I bring; Bless thou, love, my lyre,— Let it nobly sing Thee the eternal queen of every poet-king. XXIV All my yearning spirit, Love, to-night I raise; Let my soul inherit At the end of days That heaven whence thou stoopest, coveting our lays. XXV For our lays thou lovest, Though thou art a queen, Woman; though thou movest Over floors serene, Golden in skies untroubled, measureless in sheen. XXVI Yet our songs thou hearest, And thou dost bestow Power; yea, love, thou carest For thy bards below Snatching at sacred joys they may not fully know. XXVII O thou rose eternal, Heavenly love, made fair Not as flowers diurnal,— Filling all the air Of purest heaven with fragrance passing man's speech rare; XXVIII Take this song and bear it Through the clouds of night; For thy garland wear it,— Smile with smile most bright Upon my soul, and make it, as thy soul is, white! 1878. TO THE ENGLISH POETS OF THE PAST Ye whose lips were wet With the self-same sea, Hearken unto me: Let now my voice by your victorious harps be met. Ye too struggled on; Following after fame Till at length it came— But came not till your mortal shapes were dead and gone. Ye too loved and spake In the English air: Found the same flowers fair; Marked the same tides upon the same white cliff-sides break. Ye too in your time Knew love's wonder here: Found love's message dear; Recorded love's worth in imperishable rhyme. Oh that in the end I may join, I too, You great voice,—and you,— May touch the hands of many a true bay-wreathéd friend! Surely with the same Passion of pure love Which your hearts did move, I too love the shores wherein ye won your fame. Singing in an age When the noises sharp Drown out many a harp, Imperious battle harder than your war we wage. Yea, if but one heart Doth respond to ours, Resting in our bowers Of song, it is reward thought great for living Art. Yea, if but one hears; And if dead we find All the bards who twined Round their brows of old the laurels of past years: If but these we find Gladdened by our song, All our souls are strong To face the bitter days of obloquy unkind. For the self-same land Shall receive our word, Over which was poured The sacred stream of song from many a former hand. And though in our day Listeners are but few, Splendider is too The victory of the voice which nothing can gainsay. The victory of the harp Sure-voiced as the sea: O'er which there can be No mist nor vapour flung by foolish tongues that carp. O great English bards, Grant us in the end Triumph, and extend To each who struggleth now 'mid waves whose force retards, As each soul deserves, Greeting from on high, Help, and victory; If but to the utter end each battles on, nor swerves. 1878. TO APOLLO I O king Apollo O'er mount and hollow Do I not follow with weary feet? Do I, pursuer, Where skies are bluer And meadows softer, recede, retreat? Thy gold hair flaming In front flight shaming Leads onward ever, than stars more sweet. II How many follow Thee, lord Apollo, Yet lay no hands on thy garments' hem! They sink down weary By road-side dreary, Sink, and the world hears nought of them: Their harps are taken, Their god forsaken, And the austere lips of the god condemn. III But surely, surely, Patiently, purely, I have thee followed, O lord, O king! I have not trembled, Nor quaked, dissembled Before the world,—but the deep pure thing Thou gavest me, loudly, Strongly and proudly, I have not ceased, through life, to sing. IV The gift thou gavest Among the bravest, The dearest, sweetest, of loves and friends, I've used; not heeding Feet full-oft bleeding And heart that the world's sharp spear-head rends: Now may I rest On the night's dim breast As at thy coming my pale chant ends. V Lo! thou appearest, Apollo, and clearest The heaven above thee with awful might: The clouds before thee Retreat—high o'er thee Within thy tresses the sun flames bright: And the seas thy footing Follow with floating Ripples of august golden light. VI Now let me, weary, The black night dreary Evade for ever, now thou art here: My song is ended Now, fierce, extended Across the skies thy white steeds rear! My song is over Now thou, song's lover, As gold-haired bridegroom dost appear. VII Take my pale singing: Let some notes ringing High upward, skyward, remain, abide: But oh thy laughter So sweet, comes after, So silver-clear o'er the charmed sea-tide; And what can singers Of earth with fingers Feeble fashion for song thy bride? VIII Is she too golden Of locks, and holden Within her hands is a harp-stem true? Or black-haired rather, Nereus her father, Did she step forth from the sea-caves blue With musical feet Apollo to meet,— With grey glance subtle, snow-white of hue? IX Yea, she was gracious Within the spacious Deep domes of singing beneath the waves; And what can our song, Our pale earth's flower-song That twines with roses the grass of graves Be to the tender And soft-voiced splendour Of white seas breaking in dim sea-caves? X While thou wast wedded, Our groans have eddied From lonely bosoms upon the breeze: While thou wast toying With thy bride, cloying Thy soul with sweetness, we wooed not ease, Pallid and crownless And careworn, renownless, Hopeless as arms of the storm-lashed trees! XI Therefore remember With us December Abides while summer, O gold-haired king, Is with thee alway, And thy bright hallway With laughter of red lips laughs and may ring: Alone not ever Thou wast,—yea never With lone lips hadst thou had heart to sing. XII So when thou flamest In dawn and aimest Thy final arrows at earth's last night, Forget not those who In pain arose,—who Sang to thee, song-god, when nought was bright Save only the endless Love then thought friendless Wherewith they longed for thee, longed for thy light. Feb. 10, 1880. TO BEATRICE I The swift years follow Each other, and hollow As we grow older their voices sound; Now dim behind us, A sun to blind us Once, yea sun-sweet o'er the charmed bright ground Shines love, low-gleaming, Like red sun dreaming Behind dark forest or green far mound. II Still, still there quiver The ripples of river, The snow-white sheets of the sea-born foam; The meadow-sweet lifted By June-breeze, drifted In soft bloom-powder, doth flutter and roam The wood-glades deep Where our dreams sleep, Sleep, and abide in their fair old home. III There roses many, For us not any, Blossom; new lovers their bloom shall seek; New face of maiden With new love laden Shall flame in the forest, and new lips speak The same soft message Of sweet calm presage; New tides, white-footed, charge up the creek. IV Apollo and love Yet hover above The chaste green woodland; singers are there; Birds in the larches, And under the arches Of grim grey tall trees, echo their fair And yearly delight, And gold through the night Falls gently the flood of the wood-nymphs' hair. V These yet abide, Though the years deride Our love, our pleasure, our hopes of things That pass swift-sweeping, Their dim eyes weeping, Now by us and chide us, pale uncrowned kings; The old same splendour Of meadow-sweet tender In one white flush to the moist dale clings. VI Thou art not there O woman, O fair Long-lost loved spirit of early days; Then oh where art thou And where thy heart, thou Who wanderest from me in flowerless ways Where is no singing, Yea, no voice ringing For ever as ever with changeless praise. VII The years escape us, The long months drape us In wearisome mantle of deepening gloom; Oh dost thou, lady, Dream of the shady Dell where we met when the rose was in bloom And the white small lily Starlike the hilly Dear northland gladdened, with love's perfume? VIII Green were the alleys Of woods, the valleys Were bright with summer, the soft still streams Dappled the meadows With silver; the shadows Of evening made more tender the dreams The stars and the moon Took charge of soon Splendescent, and crowned with viewless gleams. IX Wonderful laughter Of thine years after Rang sweet within me, O girlish queen! Wonderful gladness That smote the sadness Of all the black strange years between Came on the heels of it, Chimed in the peals of it, As though no night of our sorrow had been. X Still by me I hear it, Tender and clear it Rings out, gentle and pure as of old; Again I am near thee And watch thee and hear thee, Yea, in my hand thine hand I hold, And the laughter deathless Trembling and breathless Keeps me, superb from the mouth of gold. XI Ten years between us Serve but to screen us The better from others, the closer to draw Our hearts together, As in wild weather Souls cling more closely and ice-hearts thaw, When some tossed vessel Rises to wrestle With thundering waves that follow and awe. XII How hath death revelled 'Mid locks dishevelled Since at our feet the stream lisped low! How many have left us, Dark arrows have cleft us, Arrows sped from the death-god's bow: And though Apollo The death-god follow, Some sad seeds hath he of song to sow. XIII Thou art not altered, Nor have I faltered In my clear mission of endless song: If death should seize us, His cold touch freeze us, Long ere a decade as sad, as long, Pass once more by us, He may not deny us The past, its beauty, its love-voice strong. XIV Death cannot foil us Wholly, despoil us Of one sweet love-throb that e'er hath leapt Through the bosom that bounded As some foot sounded, Dear to us, clear to us,—near to us stept; The old woods yet the same for us With song-flowers flame for us, Though ten years' summers have dawned and have slept. Feb. 13, 1880. TO A LADY WITH DEEP BLACK HAIR Wonderful hair Deep-flowing and rare, Full of the dreams of the loves of the past, Than flowers more fair, Around me thy magical spells are cast. O sweet sweet tresses, What far caresses Wait you in bowers and dells of the land As on time presses? What tenderest touching of love's soft hand? Black, deep black, With never a track In their deep sweet midst for the moon to follow; Ever they lack The bright sunbeams that in gold deep hollow Of gold hair hide: No sunbeam bride Thou art, O lady; thy black black hair Is sweeter than tide Of gold that lures from his deep hill-lair Apollo the king With gold fleet wing, And forces his lips to bend and to kiss, And kissing, sing. Purer are thy black locks than this. And the scent of the rose The deep hair throws From its midst, the subtle unspeakable charm That in deep hair glows, Or in sweet white shoulder or rose-sweet arm. Oh, if the hair So tenderly fair Shines, what must the kiss of the soft lips be, Moulded to snare With laughter or soft speech,—wondrous to me! O black black locks, As the time-wave rocks O'er sands and shoals, take this brief song Which the time-surge mocks With music of ripples alive and strong. O wonderful hair So black, so rare, So deep, so dark, so splendid a coil For a woman to wear, Too splendid a crown for death to soil, Immortally sweet, A singer I greet Your beautiful tangled and twisted mass That down to the feet Once tenderly loosened methinks might pass. Unkissed they abide,— Not crowned as a bride Thou art, O lady; thou art as a queen Of chaste high pride Who on throne superb and sedate is seen, Ruling the land With soft white hand,— And wonderful unkissed black dear hair Twined band upon band, The sweetest of all things God made fair. July 27, 1880. LINES ON THE DEATH OF A CHILD I Fresh flowers of spring, New birds on wing, The young year's breezes, soft-plumed and divine; New faces fair In glad new air, The young green tender buds upon the pine; New white tides' jocund race— But not the little footstep, not the little face! II The gold hair sleeps Amid the deeps Of God, amid the arms of angels fair; No more to me Its purity Gleams gold across the dazzled morning air; Soft footsteps green meads grace, But not the little footstep, not the little face! III Red roses blow Now, row on row, And white dear buds, the likeness of a child; And pimpernels Peep forth in dells, And o'er the seas the April winds float mild; Such gladden every place, But not the little footstep, not the little face! IV No more, no more, By hill or shore The grey eyes laugh, the child-look upward smiles: Many are fair In life's new air, Some with the sweetest love that woe beguiles, Lips that can sorrow chase— But not the little footstep, not the little face! V The lanes are sweet With young girls' feet; The roads of late life bloom beneath the tread Of women-flowers Who star life's bowers, Dark-haired, divine, with locks whence sweetness shed With flowers doth interlace— Where is the little footstep, where the little face? VI Dark hair is sweet, And passion's heat; But ah! the bright glow of the early day When simple things On snow-white wings Gave joys that now for e'er must pass away— Leaving no trace, no trace, Where trod the little footstep, laughed the little face. 1880. THE CHILD Blue skies, bright, clear, Another year, But ah! the dear dead child: Another bloom Has sought the tomb With pure step undefiled; Another flower In death's dim bower Has smiled. The days advance With flower-bright lance Of chestnut blossoms piled Upon the stems Like diadems; The green woods kiss the mild Soft-kissing breeze; The leaping seas Are wild. All things aglow Forget the snow, The chill of winter's hand; With yellow crown, Weighty, bowed down, Laburnum clusters stand; The new young spring With flowers doth ring The land. One step we hear Not,—one, this year; Ah me, the child! the child! One face we miss, One soft child-kiss, One mouth that, last year, smiled; Roses are red This year instead Of red lips of a child. Lilies are fair In summer air, And deep lush grasses green; But ah! the child Whose tresses wild Bright as the sun were seen Last year, last year,— A spirit here, A queen. Blue are the seas And pure the breeze, The old earth unaltered stands; It stretches forth East, south, and north, And west, unaltered hands; But ah, the child! the child! Flowerless for us are all the altered lands— Ah child! ah dead Lost dear gold head— The child! the child! 1880. AT A THEATRE-DOOR IN SUMMER Children with heather in hand, Passing along through the Strand, Where have you been through the day? In what far meads at play? Your hands are filled with fern, And your faces tingle and burn. Was not the country sweet And fresh to tired young feet? Were not the grasses green And the wonderful skies serene? The wonderful miles of sky That made you on fire to fly; That made you long to be birds Or gambol, like fleet-foot herds. Now you are tired; your feet Are weary; your young hearts beat. Again from the flowery land You return to the gaslit Strand. And standing at theatre-door In July, I watch you pour Tired, glad, through the street, With innocent looks and sweet. And after you come the girls With wanton and golden curls Who live on the lusts of the Strand, Not a few with ringed white hand. Perhaps some short years ago, That girl with the tresses aflow Went for a country day, A school-treat, laughing and gay, Like you, little girl,—who perhaps May be caught in the town's lewd traps In a few more years, and follow That woman whose laugh rings hollow. O child with the gold gold hair Will you be caught in the snare? May God your steps preserve That they stumble not thus, nor swerve From the heather-bell path to-day You follow with footstep gay! O gold-haired wonderful child, With glances laughing and wild, May you never along the Strand With other than white child-hand Filled full of beautiful flowers Pass, in the passionate hours Of later life; may the bloom Of to-day's joy last till your tomb, Keeping you tender and good O child-face under the hood! Keeping you gentle and fair, O angel in soft night-air Of London passing along, Not with a sigh, but a song! And are those the tears I see In the hard set eyes of thee O Strand-girl, watching the strut Of the children whose one day out Has made them richer than queens; Eight hours in grassy scenes. O girl with the face still fair, Kissed by the soft night-air, Were you too fragrant as flowers, In spirit, in long-lost hours? Did you carry ferns and heather Through London in July weather? Oh, carry them once again; Forget the sin and the pain. The night-air waits to redeem Thy spirit: the stars yet beam, And the heather in front for thee Shines,—and the moon on the sea. So dreamed I; watching the throng Of children, with shout and song After their country day, As they crowded the crowded way, Pressing their soft young curls In the gowns of wanton girls, And pushing amid the crowd Of the night-Strand, boisterous, loud. I watched them all pass by, Kissed by the clear night-sky; Watched them all till the last Small baby, slumbering fast, Wrapped in a tight red shawl, Was carried by: God bless all. 1880. TO THE QUEEN OF MY YOUNG LIFE I Was there one summer air Wherein thou wast not fair, O sacred queen above my young life bending? Was there one blade of grass Where thy foot did not pass, Verdure and beauty of quiet blossom lending? II In the blue surging seas Thou wast, and in the trees, A spirit of pure delight, of high dominion; And in the sunset air, A seraph winged and fair, Glorious with glory of white unearthly pinion. III Sweet from the glittering wave Thou camest, and didst lave Thy white feet, Venuslike, in less white foam; The awful wood-glades green Thou ruledst, their swift queen; Through flowers, a splendour of white, thy foot did roam. IV Now, looking back, I know What meant that early glow, That voice of passion in the vast calm air; That wonder of the corn When thou, first love, wast born, Making all wonder of youth more wondrous fair. V Now glancing back I see The long-lost shape of thee Tender and pure amid the early flowers: Thine eyes of swift grey-green, And thy soft laugh serene I hear, low-ringing amid the haunted bowers. VI O valley, soft green glade, Wherein my love was laid When, for this earth's brief space, it fell a-sleeping, Hearken,—and birds that fly Athwart that Northern sky, Or sing, for pleasure indeed, where I go weeping! VII Hearken,—as I look back O'er the long sunburnt track, Sunburnt, blood-stained, and trodden deep by sorrow, Wondering what calm may lie Before me, when I die From earth and labour of earth, in heaven's to-morrow! VIII Where art thou blowing to-day O rose that o'er life's way Shonest in the early soft sundawn so sweetly? Art thou as splendid still, A woman born to thrill The hearts and spirits of men, divine completely? IX Art thou as splendid yet As on the day we met? Though hours of twelve long years have fled away On urgent time-tossed wings, The memory round me clings Of beauty of thine, intense with sunrise-ray. X A woman art thou now, Thought-crowned and calm of brow,— A budding rose of morning wast thou then; Girl-soft and sweet of mien, At beautiful fifteen,— A spirit of perfect bloom to gladden men. XI Just as the girl and child Met in thy love-glance wild, The look perchance of woman and girl doth meet Upon thy flower-face now, And in thine elder brow, Graver to-day, yet not one shade less sweet. XII But passion stronger still Than passion of the rill Of youth,—yea passion of the deep-toned sea Is in thy nature, queen, Now the long years have seen The rosebud brighten and fill with flowers the tree. XIII On thee death lays no hand, Thou queen of sea and land, Queen of the forest, darling of the vale; Crowned with all song's sweet flowers, Yea, plunged amid the bowers Of endless singing as 'mid rose-clusters pale. XIV Thou hast grown from bud to flower, Ripened in every power; Still for thy footstep yearns the enringing foam That hems that Northern shore And sings to it, evermore,— As ever around thy form my song-tides roam. XV Still yearns the dark-blue deep Of heaven with eyes that weep To see thee treading along the airy strand Where, twelve long years ago, We wandered to and fro, Loving as children love, hand locked in hand. XVI Yet not as children love, For over and above Our child-mirth rang the intense enthralling sound Of sorrow yet to be Enthroned o'er you and me; Sometimes the autumnal leaves swept o'er the ground. XVII The summer passed: to-day The flowers have fled away, But all the autumnal dying tints as well; Summers in front, sublime, Chant, bird-voiced, through my rhyme, With message of ardent glowing life to tell. XVIII Passion is fierce and strong Though the cold years be long And tedious o'er us hangs the love-god's hand: Most slow of heart is he, Yet still the old sweet sea Curls ripples of silvery foam upon the sand. XIX Still in the dells the flowers Worship the sun for hours, And blossoms burn where our soft steps should be; The wayward fern-fronds grace The old familiar place, And the old unchanged soft moonbeam lights the sea. XX And the unforgotten face Of thee, sweet, fills the place As with a flame of tender-scented flowers; Wilt thou not wait for me, Soft-footed, by the sea, Glad-footed, a flower within the twelve years' bowers? XXI O moon of splendid calm, O thrilling soft white palm, O glory of womanhood, mature indeed, Is now thy bosom ripe, Proud-womanly in type, And shall it seek, for love's great flower, a weed? XXII By all the young glad days And the eager burnished blaze Of golden sunlight on the laughing sea, And rays of tremulous moon, And night's low-surging tune, Is love forgotten, O queen, forgotten of thee? XXIII Oh, are there roses bound Within thy breast and wound Within thine hair, and not one rose for me? Are there within thy breast Ten thousand thoughts caressed Flowerlike, yet not one thought for the old bright sea? XXIV Oh, hath thy kiss delayed By road-side, hath it strayed Amid the untender woods, sweet, far from me? Then let it now return Rose-soft, and o'er me burn, Like greeting of west wind gentle o'er the sea! XXV Hath thy dear mouth the flowers Made fragrant for long hours, And hath thy mouth no blossom-kiss for me? Shall I not, one night, mark, Moon-splendid through the dark, Thee tender as God, love, love-flushed by the sea? XXVI Shapely as Venus, white As her own body bright, Tender with awful tenderness for me, A perfect woman-form Moon-white, unclothed and warm, A goddess whose wings brood, passionate, o'er the sea. XXVII Then shall thy perfect kiss Be God to me in bliss,— Godlike, me godlike make; transfigure me: And as the old world's dead wings Release me, lo! there rings My voice of risen delight, love, o'er the sea. 1880. TO MY LADY A BALLAD Wonderful throat and neck, Marble, pure, beyond fleck. Wonderful sea-deep eyes, Splendid as waves or skies. Wonderful arms and hands, Wonderful soft hair-bands. Wonderful lips, divine With savour of eglantine. From what wonderful land Camest thou, girl-form grand? Rising, as Venus rose, From white waves, whiter than snows. Coming, as Venus came, To set the world aflame. Love, where art thou now, Tender, noble of brow? What flowers in what land Have caressed thine hand? Dost thou dream or me, Dream of our old sweet sea? Dream of the love-sweet dell Where our footsteps fell? Dream of the words I spoke When love the silence broke? Dream of the deep green valleys Whence the soft breeze sallies, Laden with odours fair That soften the summer air? Dost thou dream of the days When, ardent with new-born lays, I flung at thy dear feet Many a song-flower sweet? Splendid as Dante's queen (She too was fifteen When he first beheld Her figure and love forth-welled)— Splendid as Dante's bride Thou wast, by the green cliff-side Standing, lithe, upright, Youth's wonderful one sweet sight. Now thou art no more A glory on that far shore. The inland woods have heard Thy laughter, O love-voiced bird! And inland flowers have seen The seawind-kissed fair queen. Art thou content with flowers That blossom within thy bowers? Dost thou not yearn for the sea? Dost thou dream never of me? Take this one far word: Let the sound of my song be heard Where thou art sitting to-day,— Look up, sweet,—hearken, I pray Give me thy wonderful hand, And enter the long-lost land Enter the woods one night, A spirit, a wonder white. Or I will wait for thee By the old unaltered sea. Give me a kiss and cling About me, O soft of wing! Touch me with every nerve: With wonderful bend and curve Of wonderful supple form, Womanly, eager, warm, Earnest, swift, on fire, Satiate my desire. Let body and neck and face Mix in a wild embrace, Awful, entire, supreme, Great as a great God's dream. Give me thine utter soul, Thy spirit, thine heart,—the whole. Be compliant and pure; With rapture of clasp secure My neck in thine eager hands, And smother with loose hair-bands (That fluctuate over me, So that their night I see Alone, and nought beside Save star-eyes of my bride) My face, and pour thy splendour Great, terrible, burning, tender, Throughout me: like all flowers That ever filled earth's bowers; Or like the rush of a stream, Or music's manifold dream. Like one multiform flower, My body and soul imbower,— One woman-blossom, giving Joy utter, abundant, living; Joy beyond all speech, That song's words cannot reach, Joy that quivers along The body in throbs of song, And through the soul in leaps That stir the soul's dim deeps— Wonderful body divine, Flower-body, be thou mine; Flower-lips, rose-mouth, kiss, cling,— White arms, be tense white ring My body to embrace: And, wonderful woman-face, Thy spirit through thine eyes Mingle, with dear low sighs Of sacred joy with me: Woman, my woman be. 1880. LOVE-SONG Are the roses in the green lanes sweet, The soft airs tender? Are the red flowers bright among the wheat, Clothed in rich splendour? Are the white waves swift upon the shores, With feet advancing? Is the moon a marvel when it pours Forth light-floods dancing? Are the stars a glory in the sky,— The green sea-billows A grandeur—is there sadness in the sigh Of wind-swept willows? Is there wonder in the melody of night, And perfect glory In the tossing of the long manes white Of sea-waves hoary? Is there soothing in the North wind's kiss, The South wind's greeting? Is the West wind messenger of bliss, Tired faces meeting? Is there healing in the great sweet hand Of God which lifts us, Redeeming from the waste far land Where sorrow drifts us? The roses on thy lips are sweet, Thy soft kiss tender: Thy feet shine swift among the wheat, Garbed in white splendour. Thy steps are swift upon the shores, Glad steps advancing: Thy glance a marvel when it pours Forth love-floods dancing. Thine eyes are tender as the sky That meets the billows: Thy soul is gentle as the sigh Of breeze-swept willows. There is wonder in thy melody by night, And perfect glory In the trembling of thy soft hands white O'er love-tales hoary. There is soothing in thy soft soft kiss, Balm in thy greeting: Thy lips are messengers of bliss, Long-lost lips meeting. There is healing in thy sweet white hand, O love, which lifts us, Saving from the roseless land Where life's storm drifts us. 1880. THE IMMORTAL AND THE MORTAL Oh where the immortal and the mortal meet In union than of wind and wave more sweet, Meet me, O God— Where thou hast trod I follow, along the blood-print of thy feet. Oh, though the austere ensanguined road be hard And all the blue skies shine through casemates barred, I follow thee— Show thou to me Thy face, the speechless face divinely marred. Lo! who will love and follow to the end, Shall he not also to hell's depths descend? Shall he not find The whole world blind, Searching among the lone stars for a friend? Lo! who will follow love throughout the way, From crimson morning flush till twilight grey? Who fears not chains, Anguish and pains, If love wait at the ending of the day? If at the ending of the day life's bride Be near our hearts in vision glorified: If at the end God's hand extend That far triumphant boon for which we sighed. Oh, where the immortal to our mortal flows, Flushing our grey clay heart to its own rose, Spirit supreme Upon me gleam; Make me thine own; I reckon not the throes. I would pour out my soul in one long sigh Of speechless yearning towards thine home on high: I would be pure, Suffer, endure, Pervade with ceaseless wings the unfathomed sky. Oh, at the point where God and man are one, Meet me, thou God; flame on me like the sun; I would be part Of thine own heart, That by my hands thy love-deeds may be done: That by my hands thy love-truths may be shown And far lands know me for thy very own; That I may bring The dead world spring:— The flowers awake, Lord, at thy word alone. Oh, to the point where man and God unite, Raise me, thou God; transfuse me with thy light; Where I would go Thou, God, dost know; For thy sake I will face the starless night. The night is barren, black, devoid of bloom, Scentless and waste, a wide appalling tomb; Dark foes surround The soul discrowned And strange shapes lower and threaten through the gloom. But where thou art with me thy mortal, one, God, mine immortal, my death-conquering sun, Meet me and show What path to go Till the last work of deathless love be done. 1880. DEATH Death that healest the weary, Descend thou upon me, Dividing life's days dreary With surge of sea. Lo! my spirit's summer Fades, is past and gone: O thou swift sure comer, Speed thou on! Not one love abideth; No more roses gleam; Time all loves derideth, Every dream. Not one woman waits now, Not one love avails; At thine awful gates now Passion pales. Lo! through the unbroken Silence comes thy voice, Sweet, of silvery token, Saying, “Rejoice. “If no roses wait thee, Lo! I, death, am here. What if life's heart hate thee? Be of cheer! “If no bright buds yonder Flame upon the hill, Through my meads, soul, wander At thy will. “If no lips be tender, Am not I thy queen? Hath not my mouth splendour Soft, serene? “Underneath my pinion, Weary, be at rest; In calm death-dominion; This is best. “Never wake to sorrow, Sorrow never more; Dread not, child, the morrow: Life is o'er.” 1880. “DARKNESS” One moment's splendour in the crimson rose, One moment's sweetness; then all sweetness goes: Never again the flame-flushed petal glows. A star, a moon, a cloud, a space of blue; Then no more skies, moons, clouds,—no star-rays new: No fresh morn's fern-fronds exquisite with dew. Love gleaming splendid from the water white One moment, cleaving waves with shoulder bright: Then loveless passionless deep sunless night. A kiss: sweet mouth tight-pressed against our own; Then autumn dying leaves about us blown; The dim December wind's sepulchral tone. A woman's gracious quivering form to hold; Rapture to gather from her lips of gold; Then never pressure of sweet lips: we are old. One gleam of awful passion o'er the sea: Then never again, O love, the form of thee; Only the wanton flakes of foam that flee. Summer but once; then darkness and a tomb, And wings of night pregnant with purple gloom: One rose,—no more; one vain waft of perfume. One glory amid the vales of cream-white fair Soft June-loved meadowsweet in June-soft air: One meadowsweet-soft bosom; then despair. 1880. TEN YEARS AGO Ten years ago with sweetest young emotion Before thy feet I cast a swift tumultuous tossing ocean Of fancies fleet. I flung before thee flowerbuds bright and burning, And many a dream, And passion white and pure, and tender yearning, A fair heart-stream. Where art thou now, and where are all the fancies That flamed and flew? Where are the swift-winged splendid sweet romances That climbed the blue? Where are the long waves wonderful and hoary That swept the strand? Within those woods what flower hath now the glory Of thy white hand? What meadow-sweet is sweet as was thy breathing In the old lost days? What fame is pure as fame thy hand was wreathing, The old first green bays? What rose is as thy girlish breast sweet-scented, Thy shoulders fair? Yea, thy flushed cheek did find the rose and lent it Its blush to wear! What flower through all the hills and valleys gazing Shall love now see Splendid as was the unclothed white amazing Splendour of thee? What woman, Venuslike, with silvery laughter From the old-world foam Sprang sweet as thou; once loved, what love comes after? What rest, what home? 1880. O DEATH O Death in some green hollow of mountain-ranges, By some calm sea, Hast thou no haven of hope that never changes, No place for me? Hast thou no valley fair with silver fountains Where I may rest? No lake that limns its deep imbosoming mountains In liquid breast? Shall I not wake some quiet morn and find thee, Lure thee to me; Cling to thy neck, O true love Death, and bind thee With lover's glee? Thou art gentle of heart and all who love may trust thee, Thou wilt not fail; No mastering force hath power aside to thrust thee, Time's self turns pale. The russet stems of summer flowers obey thee When summer goes; No tenderest words, no blossom-pleas delay thee, Thou steal'st the rose. Thou art great of soul and o'er the hills thou sweepest, O'er sea and air; Along the violet-scented vales thou leapest And leav'st them bare. And me too singer of tragic things, and weary, Thou shalt redeem: Save from the dreamer's pang, the endless dreary Faith in a dream. O greater singer than I, and far more fateful, On me who weep Take pity and grant for songful life and hateful A songless sleep. 1880. THE LAND OF SLEEP Along with quiet spirits of elder singers I too shall sleep, When falls the hushed harp from the weary fingers In darkness deep. There are the ghosts of those who sang preceding Epochs and days; All browed like gods, yet each divine brow bleeding From thorn-mixed bays. There Keats, there Shelley; there the figure graver Of Wordsworth calm; There women-singers, souls of sweeter savour Than June-night's balm. There the swift eyes that gleamed, the hearts that tarried With us awhile, Lightening for us the woes our spirits carried With sunlike smile. When the long days have done their task and, weary, I too may go, Within sepulchral graves and caverns dreary Where cold streams flow; Within the hollow of deathland I shall wander, Bringing to these Dead spirits a sudden lyric sound of yonder Soft English breeze; A gleam of sunlight on my brow yet lingering, Glad it may be To those whose harps once laughed to their high fingering, By English sea. One breath of rose or furze or English heather, That they may weep: Then, weary alike, old hearts and young together, We all shall sleep. 1880. “AND ART THOU TENDER?” And art thou tender, O Death, to wayside roses, Not good to me? Dost thou with cold breath wither gleaming posies On hill and lea; Dost thou with gentle hand receive the summers, Their glory past; Are golden Junes within thy halls glad-comers; In chambers vast Of silent calm soul-healing restitution Dost thou, O Death, Gather the swift years weary of pollution By living breath? Oh, dost thou in thy wondrous darkened amber Superb dim caves Hold, as in fragrant solemn bridal chamber Beneath the waves, The spirits of weary singers who by mountains And rills of Greece Sang to the old-world unreturning fountains, The old-world trees? The spirit of strong unintermittent Dante Beside thy streams Dwells? Hast thou not some bower, tho' bowers be scanty, For modern dreams? Canst thou to every pallid flower be tender, Each pale past song, Yet not unrobe for us thy viewless splendour O death-breast strong? Sweeter than woman, stronger than the passion That through youth's veins Bounds at a woman's touch in fierce old fashion, Death, heal our pains! 1880. AN ELEGY I And art thou dead? O hushed in solemn chamber Art thou the deathless form, the deathless face, Caught now in death's illimitable embrace? Is this white shrine whereover wild vines clamber Thy resting-place O wondrous body to which the waves were gracious When it sprang forth a splendour from the spacious Deep halls of sea-washed amber That close in Venus' grace? II What shall I wind, O marble brow, around thee? Surely our ancient ferns and meadow-sweet Are even than the august great rose more meet: The growth that filled the woods where love's eyes found thee And barred retreat; Those sacred groves whereover once a glory Flamed like the sun,—now dim with mosses hoary,— The woods wherein love bound thee And stayed thy girlish feet. III Wonderful hair that once the Northern breezes Found sweeter than the clover-fields that shine Starlike along the level cliff-top line, Now may death's hand toy with thee as it pleases! His fingers twine Idly the locks at sight of which love maddened, Idly the hair which all the sweet world gladdened; Now strand by strand death seizes What once was so divine. IV Thou art gone from the old grey cliff, and who may follow? Art thou to nether gods exceeding fair? Oh do they wonder at the black-brown hair, Laughing for joy within their chambers hollow As they prepare Roses and flowers and many gifts to greet thee,— Jubilant gods advancing swift to meet thee, Yea even gold-harped Apollo Thrilling with song the air. V What land of dreams is thine, what perfect splendour Of soft-voiced lovers wandering with calm feet Along the meadows that the west winds greet With heavenly kiss flower-exquisite and tender, With love-touch fleet: Whom hast thou now, O sweet beyond all roses, On whose strong heavenly breast thy breast reposes,— Or dost thou not surrender, Alone for me flower-sweet? VI Oh, through the woodlands, o'er the old seas foaming, Spirit of perfect love, I cry to thee! Wilt thou not wait me by some sunset-sea,— Within the purple sombre shadow of gloaming,— By green spring-tree? Human art thou no more? or art thou stronger In sweetest passion-force as years grow longer? Stronger in that thou art roaming Heaven-lands apart from me! VII So to the spirit I cry: Thy wondrous body Sweeter itself than flowers, with flowers I ring, And these poor garlands of sad words I bring; Garlands wherein the autumn leaves mix ruddy With sprays of spring: Words patient under sorrow and uncomplaining, Yet stricken of grief as leaves the storms are staining,— Which, golden-hued or bloody, Flutter from autumn's wing. VIII No more the waves shall worship thee their daughter Born of the tender wreaths of Northern foam; No more shalt thou with sun-sweet footstep roam Over the grey tossed leagues of billowy water, Thy well-loved home: The tomb now holds thee as it holds each flower That fades to whiteness in one deathful hour; The hills that heard thy laughter Gaze now upon thy tomb. Sept. 5, 1880. NO MORE The sweet green flowerful laughing summers coming Again shall shine; Again the June wind's subtle fingers strumming Shall shake the pine; Again the yellow-banded bee go humming O'er clover and vine. Again the long waves, wonderful in whiteness, Shall storm the shore; The yellow moon with the old weird shimmering brightness Her rays forthpour; Yea, some shall love with the old unchanged heart-lightness, But we no more. Weary the world seems; like a woman colder Who soft words said But yestereve and leant with dear soft shoulder Against our head: She is changed to-day, and all the world's grown older! Its charm is fled! 1880. ANOTHER AUTUMN The leaves again are glorious green and golden; The child is gone Whose laughter through the bright glades in the olden Days lured me on. While as of old with sanguine autumn splendour The wild woods shine, Not as of old the young face soft and tender Looks up to mine. Once I could happier make a child's heart beating With love of me By word or touch, than all the high sun's greeting Makes glad the sea. Now weary amid the self-same groves I wander; As erst, they are fair: But one gold gift shines not that once shone yonder— A child's gold hair. One gentle thing that sounded sounds not ever— A child's sweet tone: One hand will seek the hollow of my hand never; I am alone! 1880. HOLD THOU MY HAND! When I too pass at length, a weary singer, To death's dim land; When no more dreams and visions round me linger, Hold thou my hand! When the last song is sung, the last word spoken, The last kiss sealed— When for thee, love, the silence is unbroken, Nor death's gates yield; When for the last time I, thy poet tender, Thy mouth have kissed; When no more round thee sweeps the wild song-splendour; Shall I be missed? Will morning flowers lack somewhat, love, of brightness Because of me? The moon with less of thrilling soft love-whiteness Caress the sea? Will the long days without me, love, be dreary; The long strange days? The uncaressing starless cold nights weary? Footsore the ways? Wilt thou remember how the old dear moon-glory Fell o'er the seas? The thunder of waves whose prancing squadrons hoary Charged at our knees? And oh the night: the night of sacred wonder, Mute, crowned of stars, When, once, the fiery love-god smote in sunder All gates and bars. Wilt thou, when never through the night's dim sweetness In close embrace We watch the hours fly past with winged strange fleetness, Think of my face? Think of the singer who for thee sang solely, When not one heard; Who gave thee all his soul-power, gave it wholly In deed and word? Thou art weary of song sometimes; wilt thou be weary When no songs more Beat at thy window with moon-pinions eerie? When no sounds soar? When for the last time through the night I follow The form of thee Leading to our sequestered soft dream-hollow Beside the sea? When never again in breathless love I hold thee O woman, O sweet! Never again in strong embrace enfold thee Nor thine eyes meet! Oh be not weary; think how short a season Love-life may be! Thou lovest me, I know, beyond all treason; So love I thee. Hold thou my hand through life: and if death takes me To his dim land Ere thou must go, then, as life's breath forsakes me, Hold thou my hand! 1880. THEE FIRST, THEE LAST Because thou wast the first To waken passion's thirst When all the morning youthful air was sweet; Because while skies were blue And fern-fronds fresh with dew Thine eyes were morning's eyes for me to meet, Thy name first, last, in song-land I repeat. Because the seas were fair With breath of morning air,— Because enchanted sunlight filled the bays; Because in vale and dell Young springlike petals fell And dreams were sweet in many a woodland maze, Thee first, thee last, in song to heaven I raise. Because the woods were green, Because thou wast my queen Long ere pale sorrow haunted with sad eyes The autumn desolate rills, And thunder-smitten hills, And wild moors which the purple heather dyes, Song's light outlives the sunshine of the skies. Because thou wast my Bride, Young, beautiful, soft-eyed, Long ere the voice of other woman spoke; Because thou wast the flower First sent in life's first hour, White as the seas that round our footsteps broke, Both first and last I bow me to thy yoke. Because no woman's face Had, then, the same sweet grace, Nor had the eyes of woman magic then To lead astray my heart; Because the crown of Art Thou wast, and my life's mission among men Thou madest plain, I hymn thee, love, again. I hymn, sweet lady, thee, With voice of our old sea, With passionate surge of song-wave on the shore Of fast-receding time; I seek thee in my rhyme, Beautiful, tender as thou wast, once more. I loved thee in silence. Now my songs adore. Because in the early glow Of morning thou didst throw A glamour o'er my life that never yet Hath faded quite away, Though shades of evening grey Are in the west, and cold years must be met, Upon thy brow this wreath of song I set. I bring thee, love, again A soft memorial strain; A memory as of morning o'er the sea: Pale flowers for thee to wind, With love-glance flung behind, Within thy tresses ere swift years that flee Banish the morning thoughts, and thoughts of me. Thee first, thee last, I crown And lay my singing down Just as of old for blessing of thine hand; Again, in dreams, a boy, Full of love's fiery joy, Watching the sea-shades of thine eyes I stand, While miles of meadow-sweet scent all the land. 1880. THIS VERY DAY This very day long years ago The autumn woods were sweet With passage of thy feet, Thrilling the wild gold wheat And glades where dim flowers blow. Eleven years this very day I asked thee to be mine And round thy brow did twine Ferns, heather, and woodbine, And many a woodland spray. Eleven long long years! Where hast thou been so long, O lady of my song,— For still the wild flowers throng The woods, and still thine ears May hear the old love-strain That filled the woods that day Around thy spirit play, Cheering thy feet that stray Along life's outstretched plain. But oh that autumn day! How sweet the clear blue weather Was, when we strolled together, Feet light as flying feather, Along the woodland way: Talking of fairy-lore; Of many mystic things; Of the rustle of love's wings; Of how love sits and sings; Till night came, all was o'er. Over: for ever over: The long sweet day was ended, The light with darkness blended, The trees dark arms extended; Faded the scent of clover. Faded love's fragrance too; Faded the rocky seat Whereon you sat, my sweet, With mosses for your feet; Darkened the skies so blue. And all was in the past; That past which holds our dreams, And all the dead sunbeams, And all the dried-up streams; Holds them,—and holds them fast. There in the past art thou, O lady of the dear Green woodland that shines clear Across so many a year; So clear I see it now: And see thee with the face So dear, so sweet, so young, That all my heart hath sung, That once my spirit wrung, Yea, slew it for a space; See thee with soft girl's eyes Upon that mossy seat, O girlish love so sweet; Within that green retreat, Beneath those blue lost skies. O wonderful lost dream! On this the very day I turn back, while I may, And sing a lost moonray, A wandering starry beam; And sing the face that shone So flushed, so fair, so sweet, Within the green retreat; Yea, sing the white swift feet Whose swiftness lured me on: Yea, sing the old strange eyes Of mingled green and grey, That on this very day Laughed in the woodland way, Flashed under autumn skies. Sept. 17, 1880. THE MIDDAY HALT Far behind the early Youthful meadows gleam: Wonderful lost places Full of sweet fair faces,— Skies o'er which the pearly Soft cloud-clusters stream. All is far behind us: We are marching on Towards it may be sweeter Summers, passions fleeter; Summer flowers may find us,— But what flowers are gone! Gone, yea gone for ever Where the sunsets go; Where the sunrise-splendour, Infinitely tender, Fades to sleep,—and never Quite the same doth glow. Is there use in glancing O'er the long strange road,— Dwelling on the fancies, Unfulfilled romances, That like sea-waves dancing Countless round us glowed? Is there use in wondering Where the dream-scents go? Now that we are older And life's skies gleam colder Is there good in pondering What once moved us so? Ah, the old vales of wonder, Sweet old flower-filled vales! Where are now your posies, All your white sweet roses? At the midday thunder Every old valley pales. For our life in midday, Yea, in burning noon, Halts beside some fountain, Half-way up the mountain; Early mists that hid day At the sun's heat swoon. Marching towards the ending, In the midst we wait: Halt our forces, gazing Down the heights amazing, Blue dim slopes extending Far towards life's first gate. Down the rocks we, weary, Gaze and wonder much How we ever reached them, How our cannon breached them; How the cliff-sides dreary Yielded at our touch. Half-way up the mountain, Here, in calm, we stand: Still the summit hideth, Still its mist derideth; By the midway fountain Wait we, hand in hand. 1880. “THOUGH THE DAY BE DREARY” Though the day be dreary, Even comes apace, The ending of the race, The sight of sweet love's face So restful to the weary. Though the day be burning, Yet shall night succeed, And darkness soft give heed To us in utter need, Responsive to our yearning. When the day is over, Comes the scent of sand Touched by the wet sea's hand To heal the burnt-up land, And waft of cliff-top clover. And brightness of thy face O love, O woman tender, Thy soul's clear endless splendour, And all thy love can render Of soft redeeming grace. 1880. ONCE: THEN NO MORE I Once shines the sweet dawn o'er the ocean spaces, Once flames the sunlight on the laughing shore,— Once life is gladdened by true friendly faces, Once: then no more. II Once love with tender beauty through life's valleys Passes, once lays soft hand upon life's door; Once from the green ravine white Venus sallies; Once: then no more. III Once fame twines bays, or love her sweeter fairer Rose-crown that all the souls of men adore; Once rings Apollo's voice, than music rarer; Once: then no more. IV Once we are lifted by the wild emotion That through our veins life's splendid vistas pour, Once gleams, superb for us, the blue broad ocean; Once: then no more. V Once tender sound of exquisite low laughter Echoes; once swift lips meet and pain is o'er; Once passion crowns us,—once and never after,— Once: then no more. 1880. “THERE COMES AN END” I Of joy, of summer days, of sweetness, Of leaf-perfection, flower-completeness, There comes an utter end: All songs, all days of calm or laughter, Are followed by a blank hereafter Towards which their footsteps tend. II Of pleasure, happiness, soft weeping, Of eager action, weary sleeping, There comes alike the close: To soft slim flower by roadside hilly, To great majestic garden lily, To red majestic rose. III There comes an end of all their glory; Their petals fade, wax faint and hoary, Are mixed with autumn hues: The dying lessening woods are splendid, Yet the bright tints throughout them blended Are those that death's lips choose. IV There comes an end to noble summers; Others flame forth, gay-garbed new-comers With fire upon their cheeks; But these too in the end lose gladness, They mix their flowerlike souls with sadness, They wither at cold weeks. V So is it with the green spring-hedges And all the laughing river-edges Whereby the glad nymphs roam: So is it with the seas whose brightness Vies with the sea-born goddess' whiteness, The waves that guard her home. VI So is it with all lovers' splendour; One day the love-god's hand is tender,— The next day where is he? Is not the next night starless, moonless, The love-couch cold, the bleak airs tuneless, Barren the waste wide sea? VII To-day the woman's kiss falls sweetly, Captive she holds her love completely And thrills him with her hair: She is gone, she is flown away to-morrow, And, for the sound of song, shrill sorrow Sits wildly wailing there. VIII To-day the bright girl's words are gracious, She leads the way through wood-glades spacious, Her white hand leads love on; She is changed and cold and all untender Next morn,—and all that woodland splendour, Lacking her grace, is gone. IX One day soft meadow-sweet abundant Makes all the still dear woods redundant With still intense perfume: The next day all the North wind's madness Has wrenched away the green woods' gladness, Scattered the white flowers' bloom. X The blue sea with soft ripples ringeth To-day, and hardly one cloud wingeth Above the waves its way; At night the black storm's evil warning Scowls in the West,—grim tides next morning Scour all the sands for prey. XI So too of sorrow itself an ending Comes some day; towards that goal we tending Lift up our hearts in praise, Grateful that change itself not ever Shall last,—that foiled downcast endeavour Shall rest in quiet ways. XII There comes an end of sweetest treasure Joy gathers up, of sorrow's measure,— Of grief's low weary strain; Of kisses God himself might covet From mouth so sweet that God might love it; Of parting's speechless pain. 1880. JUNES AND DECEMBERS I Was it in June by woodland deep That first love's soft enchanted sleep Fell on the weary eyes that weep This morning? Was it when summer wrapt the hills In tender mist, and slender rills Danced down the dales a torrent fills, Love-scorning? II Or did some girl make winter fair With softest flush of flowerlike hair, Draped in the scents the spring-months wear With laughter? Did all November smile to note Pure tresses round the white neck float, Though sorrow's wings with strokes that smote Swept after? III Was wintry night a summer dream? Did flowers upon the bright lips teem, The moon above the lovers gleam With splendour? Or was it where the soft tufts are Of meadow-sweet that softer far Her white hand glittered like a star So tender? IV Was winter banished when her face Made June-delight of all the place, And summer gladness through her grace Shone splendent? Didst thou, O lover, feel that flowers Are but for summer heedless hours,— That on no skies are woman's bowers Dependent? V What need hast thou of summer now? It smiles upon her cool clear brow; June laughs upon her lips, I vow, Rose-glorious! If, waiting thee within thy bower, Thou hast thy passionate woman-flower, She makes all days, yea, every hour Notorious. VI Divine with joy each hour she makes: Thou need'st not hunt spring through the brakes Nor groan at eddying wild snow-flakes Excessive; Thou wilt not find one day too long For love's sweet laughter, passion's song,— Nor whistling blasts of North wind strong, Oppressive. VII What matters how the day may pass, Or icicles on wintry grass, If so the night's sweet hours amass More pleasure? It may be winter through the day, But August-tresses round thee stray At eve, and June-hands for thee play Love's measure. VIII The great moon at the window-pane Some thought of winter doth retain; The waves their wintry troubled strain Are singing; But love's dear couch within is spread And heaped with summer petals shed Not now on grass or mossy bed Soft-clinging. IX O holier night than nights of June When over summer heavens the moon Sails—night that sealest love's own boon For ever, What is the summer unto thee? The white rose that awaiteth me Summer on bank or lawn or lea Held never. X No summer tenderest scent was e'er As soft as that which in thine hair Lurks, making heaven of all the air I'm breathing: No summer night was sweet as this, Crowned with thine own close clinging kiss And circled with the unfathomed bliss Thou art wreathing. XI Thou art my June, my summer, sweet,— My flowerful exquisite retreat Where, after months of toil and heat, I rest me: Thou art my bower of pure delight Wherein I gather through the night Soft mystic bloom:—oh, with love's might Invest me! XII Crown me with love, thou summer rose, Though nigh our sleep the cold wind blows; It will not reach us, as it goes Sea-seeking: Yea, nought can reach us now of pain Within this holy wondrous fane Where tender summer's lips again Are speaking. 1880. THOU ART NOT THERE! I The woods are bright to-day, The storms have fled away, The sea smiles in the bay, The corn shakes golden hair; New maidens pass along The woods with laugh and song, White flowers the green glades throng, But still thou art not there! II Wide fields the very same Beneath the hot sun flame Where once we, flower-crowned, came; New tender lips are fair; The old unchanged blue seas Shine in the same soft breeze, The same grass clothes the leas, But still thou art not there! III Is it not strange and sad That when these flowers are glad, And waves with mirth are mad, And laughter thrills the air, Is it not strange, O queen, That thou shouldst not be seen Threading the wood-glades green,— That thou shouldst not be there! IV How can the flowers be white If thou, their spirit bright, Dost linger out of sight, Heedless of all our care? How can our laughter long Fill the wide woods, and song Surge with the breakers strong, If, still, thou art not there! V Art thou not traitor, rose, To every flower that blows, To every breeze that goes Along the cliff-side bare? Art thou not false to these, To flower, to cliff, to breeze, Which worship at thy knees, In that thou art not there! VI Art thou not false to me? Lo! I am the wide sea, The blossom at thy knee, The singing North wind rare: Art thou not false and weak? The rose upon thy cheek, Love, if it could, would speak, And urge thee to be there! VII That rose would surely claim Some memory of my name; Upon thy cheek that flame Doth hidden love declare: The tears are in thine eyes, Coloured as those old skies, Which heard our passionate sighs, When thou, first love, wast there! VIII When thou wast in the sky, And in the night wind's sigh, And in the flowers that try, In vain, thy bloom to wear; When thou wast in my heart, Thrilling with tender dart Its depth, its every part,— When thou, sweet queen, wast there! IX Oh, be thou there again; Hear this far lyric strain; Sever the years of pain, Of woe so hard to bear: Be thou once more the flower Those sacred woods imbower, Yea, thrill them with thy power, They'll bloom when thou art there! X The seas are yearning, sweet, To ripple round thy feet; The odorous green retreat In our delight would share; Ne'er will one summer true Turn the waste skies to blue And give the old sunsets' hue, Till, once more, thou art there! XI The old moon this very night Upon the cliffs is bright; Be thou their blossom white, Thy glory, love, prepare: The stars have need of thee; Thy love, the singing sea, Doth whisper unto me That thou, sweet, wilt be there! XII The blossoms cannot bloom Without thee; through the gloom That hems us like a tomb The songless cold stars stare: Lo! on the cliffs I stand, Awaiting thy white hand To unlock lyric land,— Oh, wilt not thou be there? 1880. TEN YEARS I Ten years of flowers and songs and seas, What profit hath the soul of these? What spirit of gladness in the trees Abideth ever? What hath the soul the force to clasp In swift undying eager grasp, Yea, hold though death's rough fingers rasp, And part with never? II What hath the soul the power to take As new bright crimson mornings break, And in the breeze the rushes shake And laugh for gladness? What lingereth of the loves who went Adown life's valleys well content And with the sacred sunsets blent Their share of sadness? III Now all the suns have passed away And left life's valleys gaunt and grey, What word of hope is left to say, What word of greeting? Ten years of bowers and rose-sweet days And sorrow's tears in hidden ways And tender honeysuckle sprays, How swift, how fleeting! IV Ten years have passed: their flowers have fled; Their every gallant rose is dead, Not one now lifts a laughing head High gazing sunward; The blue seas shine,—but not the seas Which rippled 'neath the ten years' breeze; The green leaves quiver, and the trees Pass sunlight onward. V But what remains of flowers or sweet Gold crowns of tender cliff-side wheat? What white hands for our hands to meet, Hands sweet as clover? What bowers of beauty yet remain Unsmitten by the ten years' rain, What lips for eager lips to gain, Now all is over? VI Death looms in front: what loves behind Breathe passion on the balmy wind! What shall our further footsteps find Of splendid passion? What rose sublime upon the track Waits, nobler than the flowers we lack And yearn for, burn for, gazing back In eager fashion? VII No days had value save the days When love's foot trod the flowerful ways; No flowers are sweet save those that raise Soft heads resplendent Towards love's caressing subtle hand, Which brings delight to sea and land, Adorns with bloom the barren strand On love dependent. VIII If this be so, what future waits Our heart beyond the ten years' gates? What new loves, passions, sorrows, hates, Swift disappointment? What tenderest resting through the night On very love's soft bosom white? What climbing towards a kingly height, What proud anointment? IX The hand of death it may be gleams, Ending all loves and hopes and dreams, Where some not far-off morning beams— Death's hand there lingereth: Eager, a foeman sinewy, tall, He summons without bugle-call, And while he grimly waiteth all, His sword he fingereth. X But there are fingers sweeter far Than death's cold grisly fingers are; Beneath no sun, beneath night's star The soft hand waiteth: It toucheth like a touching rose, And sends the tingling blood in throes Past speaking sweet through heart that glows As pain abateth. XI And there are flowers that blossom still In green secluded vale, or fill With sweetness all the thymy hill, Though gone for ever Are ten years' buds and ten years' bloom, Swallowed within the unopening tomb Whose fierce lips seize each year's perfume And yield it never. XII And there are faces tender yet, Though gone past hope are those we met When still the morning dews were wet On green buds swelling: Though now life's noon sucks up the dew And cloudless burns the midday blue, Love's bloom of face hath sweeter hue And charm more telling. Oct. 20, 1880. MY BLOSSOM OF GOLD Have the days that are past, brought splendour, The long nights rest? Hath passion been nigh thee with tender And succouring breast? Oh, many are the buds that have blossomed On hill-side and lea Since the glades of the green woods embosomed, Sweet love, you and me! Not a night but a rose hath gladdened With splendour of bloom Some garden for lack of her saddened— That sighed for perfume. Not a day but a lily with gracious And infinite scent Hath blessed the bright avenues spacious Where love's foot went. Year after year they are bursting, The glad bright buds, To fill with their bounty the thirsting And blossomless woods. Last night did a rose in my garden, A mere bud at eve, Burst calyx; it stands now a warden, Doth homage receive. Yea, never a night but a maiden With lily-soft hands, Her spirit with love over-laden, To woman expands: To the rose of her womanhood's splendour, Her womanhood's might; While her lover doth guard her with tender Eyes brimming with light. Last eve there were maidens who blossom Proud roses to-day, Having slept in love's innermost bosom And smiled as they lay. To-day, they are eager with laughter, And dewy with tears; Full-blooming and blossomlike, after Nights shaken with fears. And, lady, will never a season Descend upon me, When all the dark wings of love's treason Shall rustle and flee? Last night there were locks interwreathing And lips joined in one, And exquisite blending of breathing And passion-heights won. What blossoms of infinite number Have bloomed and have fled Through the years of our passionless slumber, While we were as dead! What scents we are all unaware of Have gladdened the night! What splendour that we had no share of— What joy, what delight! Dark hair hath been mingled with golden, Sweet lily with rose, Bright bosom by passion enfolden,— Love born amid throes,— While we have been lingering, dreaming, And watching the days Far past us and over us streaming; Sole-loving in lays. Rise: ere the cold dews are upon us That death's lips breathe; Let the splendour of passion pass on us, Bright blossoms inwreathe. Be thou the dear rose in my garden Unwedded so long, That the night-winds of absence would harden Were it not for my song! Be thou the dear rose in my bosom O woman, to-night; My passionate exquisite blossom! My love, my delight! My glory, my bounty, my splendour, My blossom of gold, More sweet and superb in surrender Than ever of old. Oct. 25, 1880. “THOU ART ALIVE!” Somewhere i' the world to-day Thou breathest,—and yon spray Of honeysuckle is sweeter Since thou hast passed that way. Thou wakest at the morn And I am less forlorn,— And summer airs are fleeter, Thy voice along them borne. Thou sleepest in the night And all my heart is light, Bending above thee dreaming Soft dreams, with face grown bright. Thou art alive! yon rose The sweet sweet secret knows; Its crimson flush is gleaming More crimson as it blows. Thou livest, and the flowers Are fairer on their bowers; Softer the springlike valleys, Tenderer the fresh spring-showers: Yea, richer all the flush Of May,—the rose's blush,— Greener the dim moist alleys Wherethrough the white streams rush. More exquisite the light Of summer, when the white Or crimson dense May-blossom Gives place to roses bright. Thou art alive! and so Summer may safely glow With warm brown beating bosom O'er which the warm winds blow. And autumn too is fair, Kissed by thy waving hair: Thou treadest autumn meadows, In clear blue kindling air. The tender autumn dreams Of thee and round thee gleams,— Yea, crowns thee with soft shadows And pearl-grey sunset-beams. And winter too for thee Is full of revelry; No more the plains are chilling,— The snow smiles on the tree. Thy shapely warm white hand Gives life to lake and land: Winter with love is thrilling At thy most sweet command! Thou art alive, and bliss Doth blossom in thy kiss; Still may thine utmost splendour Be given,—yea, even this! Alive thou art, and sweet Within thy far retreat; Alive, thou canst be tender And every pulse may beat. Thy whole dear body may The force of love obey,— Leap, thrill, and burn for rapture,— Turn night to heavenlier day. Turn day to gentler night With warmth of bosom white; A sweeter thing to capture Than any blossom bright. Thou mayest, alive and strong, Turn passion's breath to song, And tune love's voice to tender Low bursts of rapture long. Thy very breath a rose, Thy form a breeze that blows Straight from far islets' splendour,— Thy secret what man knows? Thou art alive to burn With joy at every turn: To thrill with love's sweet madness: To tremble, weep and yearn: To fling thy beauty's crown, Passionate, heedless, down; To loosen, wild with gladness, Those locks of gleaming brown. Thou art alive for this! Thou art left on earth to kiss; God keeps thee, sweet, yet living That thou mayest grant me bliss. That thou mayest set thy mouth, Like red fruit from the South, Upon my own, forgiving The long long years of drouth. That thou mayest set thine eyes Upon me like soft skies; That I may feel thy bosom So softly fall and rise. That I may know how white Thou art to eager sight; How sweet a woman-blossom To handle with delight. Thou art alive for me! Yea, for our old sweet sea With tender waves to cover, Seeking, for Venus, thee. Thou art alive: I come, O flower in perfect bloom,— Thine old unchanged swift lover Emerging from time's tomb!

      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II A LIFE'S LOVE TO THE READER If some seem slighter sonnets and less strong Remember, reader, that each plays its part In building stone by stone the house of Art,— Each is one note in a continuous song, And, were each equal, each the whole would wrong:— When midsummer is gay with butterflies Some flaunt blue wings as azure as the skies, Some red, some yellow,—motley is the throng. And so with sonnets;—if the whole be fair, Blame not one sonnet in that whiter wings It waved than those its golden sister brings; Contrast is good,—and leisure to compare: Each with its own voice in the chorus sings; Each to my Lady a long-lost gift doth bear. May 27, 1882. THROUGH DEATH TO LIFE PART I EARTH I. EARTH GLADDENED I. FAIR EYES I. Fair eyes of women, many had I seen, Eyes deep as darkness, bright as noontide ray, And others bluer than the depths of day, Bluer than turquoise-jewels of a queen. But none so sweet, so wonderful, I ween,— With power to quicken, power to pierce and slay, A twin-born wonder, green and brown and grey, Three colours blended, mixed in loveliest sheen. Gazing in awe, I saw myself therein, My past and future mingled into one,— A picture harmonized from taint of sin, A poem finished, or a race well run, The melody I long had gasped to win, A moon completed, a full-circled sun. II. FAIR EYES II. Nor have I ceased to wonder at those eyes, Nor have they lost their power to make me tremble; My sweet love-shivering I cannot dissemble, Nor can I meet them yet without surprise. Most wonderful! were all the thoughts that rise Within me to be told with facile fingers, There'd still remain some loiterer that lingers, A fancy that eludes, a form that flies. Had I the sacred lyres full softly strung Of all the poets who have touched the ages, Those lyres would not suffice to get it sung; To tell the beauty which my soul engages,— To tell the torments which my heart have wrung,— Though I should rustle through ten thousand pages. Feb. 10, 1870. III. QUEEN BEAUTY Backward Queen Beauty darts her maiden glances; With lips that quiver as she glances back The poet urges on the sweet attack, With feet that flutter, and with heart that dances. The distance all her loveliness enhances; He sinks exhausted, footsteps growing slack,— She waits him at some turning of the track, Till once again hope's tremulous flood advances. So goes it: but from time to time he seizes Some cadence of the melody she sings, And even that distant silver echo pleases His spirit more than any earthly things,— And the odour of her hair on flying breezes Mad worship and a wilder longing brings. IV. FRUITION O Beauty, kiss me, kiss me on the lips: As frightened children to their mother cry I cry to thee,—Oh tell me, why should I Be like the bee that sucks, the fly that sips, The swallow that her wings in water dips,— Why cannot I possess thee? I would die But once to hear thee, see thee, feel thee nigh,— But ever from my mouth the goblet slips. Take pity on me, O my gracious Queen,— Immerse my soul in sweetness; let the waves Of rapture writhe around the mouth that craves, And choke it in fruition; rend the screen! Stand forth and let thy majesty be seen! The majesty that slays the souls it saves. V. PSYCHE AND MERCURY ONE OF RAPHAEL'S FRESCOES A face of moulded mystery that combines All sweet expression in one perfect whole, All lights and shadows of my lady's soul: Chiefly the rippling laugh that softly shines Across the corresponding facial lines. Gaze with intensity! Why I could swear I've seen it move as I was standing there, And look to me and speak to me by signs. It is my lady's face made pure for ever By the undying power of perfect art. So Dante, with wild passionate endeavour, Portrayed the endless mistress of his heart,— As her image gleamed beyond the seas that sever The immortal from our transitory part. VI. WEAK AND WEARY I wander ever onward, weak and weary:— At times there comes a great desire for rest: The days are sad, the nights are dark and dreary; I long to sink into my love's soft breast, My home, my abiding place, my snowy nest,— I long to run and hide my head therein, My face all scarred and marred with shame and sin,— And yet she loves me! why, she knoweth best. My sweet, my life, my all, my golden treasure, My bower of buds and blossoms of delight, What joy for us, what pale pursuit of pleasure, What sound of sighs and kisses through the night! What echoes of low laughter without measure From dewy eve till morning clear and bright! VII. DREAMS I. At last have passed the blanks and dreary spaces And chilling hours of the white windy day! My soul set free descends to happier places, Where golden-wingéd dreams, a bright array, Wait for me,—glimpses of sweet smiling faces, And chords of light that round my pillow play. Oh welcome, welcome, gladsome hours of night-time When fancy loosed exerts her wondrous spell, A joy to me, a marvel, a delight-time, A rainbow-coloured realm I love right well, My region of reality, my bright time (For nights are sometimes heaven when days are hell)— The time in which in dreams comes peeping in The face of her I'd give the world to win. VIII. DREAMS II. Therefore I love the darkness, and right gladly I lay me down, and close my eyes and wait, Wait,—wondering half smilingly, half sadly, What dreams will issue through the Ivory Gate. 'Tis bliss to feel that I perchance may meet her, And talk to her, and walk with her till morn, And falling low before her feet entreat her Till dreams at daylight-advent fly forlorn; To think that ere I wake to brave the morrow Closed eyes may feast in rapture on her face, And heart forget its pain, and soul its sorrow, And life its labour, for some little space, While I, with lips half parted for delight, Follow my lady through the halls of night. IX. DREAMS III. The thought of such sweet company forsaking Is odious,—would that I could stay the sun! Put back the clock, dream on without awaking, Nor rise to meet a sad new day begun! But days will pass,—they do not last for ever, And then there comes again the sweet warm night, A gentle lady, sent our souls to sever From all the wear and labour of the light. Thrice welcome art thou! brood about my pillow, And cover me with darkness as a shield, And touch my eyes with sleep—into the billow Of soft unconsciousness my soul I yield, And sinking, dying into sleep, I pray To dream of her who stole my heart away. X. THE DISCOVERY OF LOVE A youth was walking in the early hours Of life, along a garden-alley fair, When on a sudden, lo! a rose was there,— Unseen by him before among the flowers That wove a many-coloured mist of bowers, And redolent of sweetness made the air. He came the next day, but would hardly dare To hope the night's attendant band of showers Had spared the rose; but lo! the rose was red, And fragrant, far more fragrant than before, And fuller petals had unfolded more, And round about it brighter bloom was shed: The rose the lover fondly feared was dead, Was blushing beauty to the very core. XI. IN THE FUTURE I fancy somewhere waits for every one A bride, a bridegroom, far in future years: The way thereunto sodden deep with tears It may be, or parched fiery dry with sun Of lonely misery; but when 'tis done, With gladness each shall garland memory's biers, And make away with faces of old fears, And hail the advent of new life begun. And such a spot is waiting on the road Of each of us,—a place where three paths meet, Two sad ones into this that shall be sweet Converging: towards which our foreboding showed That ever since we can remember flowed The expectant eager current of our feet. XII. THOSE FLOWERS I have them still those flowers—ah! those flowers, They blossom in my heart, not withered yet, Though more than twelve months 'tis since they were wet With tender nourishing of Northern showers, Since they were beautiful in Northern bowers. Sweet savours even now of soft regret Hang round them, and a fragrant misty net Of memory, having most miraculous powers To wake the past and bring it near again. Ah! that sweet past of mine—that most sad past— Most sad, most sweet,—set thick with thorns of pain, With many a cloudy canopy overcast, Yet bearing roses one or two to last, A smile or two predestined to remain. XIII. MY LADY I said, “My love is sweet, and I will seek Whereto to liken her; her eyes are grey As the grey water mingled in a creek With green, and greener than the seas are they, And browner than the golden moor-fed stream; Her hands are wonderful, her lips are red, And as the light of morning is the beam That like a coronet crowns my lady's head; She hath a supple fawn's advancing grace, She hath the flushing of a mountain rose,— Like some sweet lily in a shady place My lady, quiet yet most queenly, grows, Waiting for one to pluck the tender flower Whose beauty floods with white the garden bower.” XIV. DANTE AND BEATRICE He circled round his Queen, and nearer grew Each fainting circle; at each meeting-place His hands with some sweet flower she would grace, Diverse in perfume, different in hue— A gracious rose, or hyacinth-bud blue, To summon up the vision of her face, To burn before him till his steps retrace The well-worn path his former footing knew. But at the last she stood fair, flowerless, white To meet him: even herself he shall attain This time, and having traversed icy plain And fiery seas and penetrated night, Shall stride—worn weary Dante—into light, And share the sceptre of his lady's reign. XV. ROSES FOR HER! Roses for her! the dark-green bays for him, To adorn the furrowed brows, the weary head, Over which leaves of sorrow had been shed, As many as on the autumn breezes swim. Lilies for her! for Dante wreathe a dim Grey crown as for one risen from the dead,— Through every cell of purgatory led,— For whom hell's horror mantled to the brim. For her the flowers of spring, for him the sere And withered branches of the later days: O Dante, great worn Dante, whom we praise By all the ages counted first and dear, Be thine the flaming offerings of the year Being ended,—hers its softer opening sprays! XVI. TO HAVE BEHELD To have beheld is something—for I might Alone with my Ideal have sought in vain Through centuries of passionate absent pain Along the sunbeam's path the casting light. But I have found it! Though the end be night, At least the fact of finding doth remain Eternal,—that a lily without stain Hath blossomed, that a woman hath been white. To have beheld and loved! If nothing more, Yet can there be a greater thing than this? If I behold and love, what do I miss? Am I within the shrine, or at the door? Though heart be fainting, every fibre sore, If I behold and love, I also kiss. XVII. THE ROSIER STATUE This hath been given, that the thing I sought I have also found: a flower I might love, A bird to sing to,—soft as any dove, And supple, and as wayward as a thought. Towards me such a worship hath been brought, And is it not enough? I might have sighed For such a vision vainly till I died, Building my silent statue all for nought. It is not so; God gives me better things:— The stone is moved and flushes, and I see No longer a white maid with marble wings, A cold ideal rounded mournfully, A shape to which thought's speechless chisel clings, But living woman's ripe reality. XVIII. LOVE AND IMMORTALITY Those magic dreams of boyhood! passing sweet They were,—the glimpses swift as when we see, Ourselves fast-moving, field and tower and tree Torn by us on the wings of motion fleet; The flashes of a future joy to meet, A heaven all untrodden yet to be. But present love transcends foreboded glee As April suns are pale in August heat, And youth's romance was but a star beside The moon of riper passion; so I think It shall be when we float upon death's tide To a new shore's, another ocean's, brink; The draught shall deeper, sweeter, be to drink Than dimly in the distance we descried. XIX. MY WORK Have I left out a flower, or a shade Of colour on the wind-swept changing grass? Has any tint of sunset seemed to pass Into the silence of a thing unsaid? Or have I failed to count each single braid As you might, sweet, before your looking-glass? Each sigh, each leaf, each fleeting cloud, alas! Deep in abysses of my memory laid, Is present with me—have I told them all? Good: then my work is over, and I may Lean head upon the table, and let fall The pen that had so many things to say: Each second of a summer to portray; All your forgotten glances to recall. XX. GOLDEN LILIES Sweet, teach me gentle secrets that thy soul Has learnt of God in early girlish years; Let me with outpouring of sweet calm tears Pass from self's kingdom into thy control, And humbly touch with lips the crystal bowl Thou holdest out with timid hands and fears: No, sweet one, I have made away with sneers; The cynic perished when his heart you stole And wrapped it in your mantle mute and pure. See I am seated, quiet, at your feet, Waiting to gather golden lilies, sweet: Preach to me, and be confidently sure That what God's tenderness has taught to you Must be for me delicious, perfect, true. XXI. THE BIRD LOVERS I. “He that hath loved deserveth not to die.” So thought I; and a sudden vision came Of birds of splendour, crowned with crimson flame, Wings touched with brilliance of the azure sky, Breasts sapphire, throats of emerald, flying high In the old forest-haunts without a name,— The sweet green palaces that shone the same Millions of centuries ere a man was nigh. I saw them frolic through the leafy arches, And a strange sense came over me that they, Those two, that loved and laughed amid the larches, And leaped with glittering feet from spray to spray, Being in the secret, had my right to stay— Yet stayed not—Death's indomitable marches. XXII. THE BIRD LOVERS II. I could have wept to think that these sweet things Had loved, not lived for ever; that the fire That lit their eyes with the same soft desire That stirs a poet's pulses as he sings, And round the raiment of a sonnet clings, And sweeps the fingers firm across the lyre,— That such a flame should faint, subside, and tire, When final sleep the ice-cold opiate brings. It ought not so to be; those birds should live For ever, had I in my power the voice To bid them blossom onward, and rejoice In endless spiral ascent—I would give To every soul Love's song-creating kiss, Eternity in which to utter this! II. EARTH DARKENED XXIII. ONCE MORE I. Once more! And can I mix the past and present Close in a single cup of claspéd hands, Into a single grasp compress the pleasant Old memories, the voices of lost lands, Into a single glance hurl all the passion That should have been, that is to be no more, Then say goodbye to you in common fashion And move to meet the lone waves' hollow roar? Once more to see you—then—I must be dreaming— My Lady of the rosebands and the bays, My sweet hair still divinely downward streaming, My dimple, and my soft caressing ways— It is not true? to-morrow I shall wake, And off my heart the accursed nightmare shake! XXIV. ONCE MORE II. Once more to bring to mind the green old places, And songs and dreams and tenderness recall, As in one flash to see my sonnets' faces In your face, then a long farewell to all; Sweet eyes...sweet lips...no time for numeration Have I, I leave a dainty list behind,— One gaze, one second in the singer's station With vision clear, the next a poet blind; Once more to feel the summer thrill flow through me, Then winter—winter—winter—and the dark, The last time at the sunrise to renew me, To the old sweet melody once more to hark, Once more—once more—then never, love, again, But one long Arctic solitude of pain. XXV. THE POET'S ROSE A poet loved a rose—and watched it grow,— And every day a sweeter blush was there, And pouting petals fuller and more fair; Each eventide “to-morrow it will blow,” The poet said—“to-morrow I shall know The perfect splendour of this flower rare;” Sometimes its beauty more than he could bear Brought tears for joy's excess akin to woe. And so he watched it,—and one night he said, “I see my rose upon the verge of bloom, To-morrow royal robes she shall assume, Uplift to heaven a pink most perfect head;” But when he came next day the rose was dead, And on that spot they placed—a poet's tomb! XXVI. THE BITTERNESS OF LIFE This is the bitterness of life,—to know That Love lies not in front but far behind: That not for violent searching shall one find A sweet-faced rose of hope beneath time's snow, Nor any flower of new joy below The furrows swept by the autumnal wind, Nor any corn-stalk when the maidens bind The golden ears in a long laughing row. This is the bitterness of life,—to feel The slow-limbed noisome minutes crawl away, But not to mark by any happy peal Of silver bells the passing of a day, Tarrying till one more consciousness doth steal Into death's pine-wood, damp, obscure, and grey. Christmas Eve, 1871. XXVII. THE MOONLIT ISLAND Behind me blooms a mystical far place, Filled with faint dreams and odours of delight; As when a mariner beneath the night Leaves the soft isle that for a little space Covered his wandering shrouds with warmth and grace, And sweet strange perfumes wafted from the shore Follow.—My island shall return no more, Nor scents of blossoms soothe a sleepless face. But as in far Pacific hazy seas Lingers that moonlit island of my soul, Washed over by a honey-perfumed breeze. And there the bright birds flit from knoll to knoll, And dappled fawns are tame among the trees, And the smooth interminable breakers roll. XXVIII. A PASSING GLIMPSE I caught a passing glimpse above my head Of Summer's coronet, pale and tender blue,— And memory ran my spirit thro' and thro', Recalling with his piercing lance-point red Summers and flowery seasons mute and dead, Long since despatched and hidden from mortal view: Recalling the sweet sense of evening dew, And sweeter sense of Love's low whispers said. It all has vanished, and I add my wailing To myriads seated by the hollow tomb, Leaning cold foreheads on its dismal railing: I mourn the utter overthrow of bloom, And spirit after tortured spirit sailing Towards Death's black impenetrable gloom. XXIX. NEVER AGAIN Is there no resurrection from the dead?— Ah, what does this one simple sentence mean? Never again to watch the grass wax green In spring-time, and the early rose wax red. Never again to mark the waving head Of some fair tuft of cream-white meadow-sweet: Never again the gold crowns of the wheat, Nor yellow leaves by autumn breezes shed! This is the meaning of the simple word;— Ne'er, after some poor thirty years or so, To listen to the song of any bird, Or hear the storm-struck sea's unquiet flow. Never again to mark a rose's grace, Nor the sweet smiling of a woman's face. XXX. HOPELESS My high hope passes. What is left me now? Yea, what is all the guerdon of my song? Why have I laboured, resolute and strong, Building, with blood-sweat from my weary brow, This Temple time doth spurn and disallow?— What recompence is there for suffering long? What justice in the world,—what wrath for wrong,— What corn to ingather for the hands that plough? The old old question: yea, the sad old story. Just one more spirit passing towards the tomb, Crowned, yet uncrowned,—brown-haired, yet aged and hoary,— With every flower of passion in full bloom, Filled with the poet's sense of life's wild glory, Yet burthened, likewise, with the poet's doom. XXXI. THE POET'S DOOM This is the poet's doom: to love all joys, To mark them fading, and to mourn them dead. To see the rose at day-break blushing red: At night to watch the wind with wanton noise Scattering the petals from their perfect poise,— Strewing with pale pink gems the brown cold bed; To marvel at some woman's curve of head, Till death both body and carven brow destroys. This is the poet's doom—far more than others To feel the life, and so the death far more: To sing for the sweet sake of tuneless brothers The beauty of each shell upon the shore: To see too deep; to love a rose too much,— And so to mark it fading at his touch! XXXII. YET SWEETER AND SWEETER Yet sweeter and yet sweeter as we pass Towards bitter death that slays all songs and flowers, Becomes the scent that hovers o'er the bowers Of youth; yet lovelier the bright green grass; Yet tenderer fair passion's burning hours; Yet softer all the varied songs of love; Yet bluer the clear spotless heavens above; And yet more manifold life's glorious powers. Now for the first time human life is fair In that there is no life beyond the grave: Now for the first time shines the morning air With true delight,—now first the branches wave In genuine glee,—now first the roses wear In perfect calm those tints no power can save. PART II HEAVEN XXXIII. NOT TOO LONG O Dante, breathe upon us, that the race Be perfect and eternal in pure love! And, Beatrice, thy golden wings above Our womanhood be calm and quick to place; Ah! let thy lips and the unforgotten face Lean over us and bring us into peace. Have we not loved, and is there no release? And didst thou leave thy Dante without grace, To linger, and to struggle, and to sigh? O Dante, make us worthy, make us strong: And, Beatrice, be pitiful, be nigh; And, Dante, burn our passion into song, And grant that it be sweet, but not too long, Lest, inadvertent, we let death go by. XXXIV. FOR YOUR SAKE For your sake, sweet, I long to stretch my hands Into the future, filled with flowers of thought,— To scatter these wild grasses I have brought In summers of far-distant times and lands. To close with Fate who wrestles and withstands In passionate haste my eagerness has sought, If haply I might mould or fashion aught Equal to cold eternity's demands. For your sake I would have the people say, “Here was a poet, and he loved, and she Was beautiful and tender as the day—” For your sake I would have my memory stay, That the hair I wrote soft words about may be Black-brown for ever, when my own is grey. XXXV. THE LAST SACRIFICE I have given you love and labour without measure, And many fruits and flowers from out my hands, And robbed imagination's dainty lands, If so I might, with a gold touch of pleasure, Be as a sunbeam brightening your leisure, And you might wind your hair in statelier bands: And you have given me—a few stray sands— To cherish, and to ponder on, and treasure. These things I have given you—life, and toil, and trouble, And laurels, and the whisper of a name, And many a blood-red sacrifice of flame, And daily aspiration of pure breath; I can but give you now my lungs' last bubble,— There is only left the sacrifice of death. XXXVI. LOVE'S UNITY There cannot be two true loves, for the soul Is smitten by the unity of God And blooms but once, whether on heaven's sod Or where the waves of earth's salt craving roll. But once in an existence shall the whole Of any heart be sweet between the hands Of Love,—but once, the vision of fair lands And far-off Canaanitish meadows stole Across the enraptured gaze of Moses; he Was only once permitted to draw near To God upon the mountain-top and see, As the blue spaces, distant and austere, Are sundered by the branches of a tree, God's image outlined beautifully clear. XXXVII. THE RESURRECTION OF THOUGHT In some clear mood of mind, when thought is free, I see the past transfigured into light, And every flower is present and as bright As when my lady's breath was sweet with me, And hands were sweet, and mingled words,—when we Bathed in the silver fountains of the night, And watched the maiden moon's unfolded might Stream over the illimitable sea. And then I know that I shall not forget, Though time with his imperishable palm Press seething reminiscence into calm, The face of any single flower we met; Nor any tear wherewith your lids were wet, When even folded round us wings of balm. XXXVIII. THE NEXT KISS I am not eager, having twice been bold To stem the torrent of the stream of love, Again to test those wavelets till, above, The river is translated into gold. Love is a bird too beautiful to hold In any untransfigured earthly hand, And sings the sweeter from the heavenly land In that our feet are hidden in grasses cold. I am not eager, though the nights are long And doleful, to renew love's magic thrill And ancient tenderness of silver song, For well I know that when I reach the hill Towards which I journey firm of foot and strong, Love's next apocalyptic kiss will kill. XXXIX. MORTAL Once clear and white the mortal woman came And softly filled the silent yearning room With a superb exuberance of bloom, A force of sweetness burning like a flame. My soul leapt forth, her passionate soul to claim: A sense as of her presence smote the gloom: I saw her eyes, and heard her lips say, “Come!” I rose, and almost called her by her name. She filled the room; and, as for me, I wept And closed my eyes and opened them again To find her still before me,—then I slept: But through my sleep I felt upon my brain Her hands drip gently like a roseleaf rain, Conscious of the unending watch she kept. XL. IMMORTAL Now clear and white the immortal woman shines, Pervading with sweet roses of her hands, And violets of her bosom, and dark strands Of endless overflowing hair she twines, Not any room, but the blue dim-seen lines Of hills, and misty spaces of the air, And rivers, and brown forests, and the fair And murmuring interstices of pines, And larches, and green hollows of the beech: As a sweet single star she shone before, But now she fills the multitudinous shore Plain in the wet reflected orb of each, And I can winnow silver grains of speech From ocean's indistinguishable roar. XLI. THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE Once Love was plain before me, for at night, Sleeping, my eyes were sundered, and, awake, Like some sweet moon reflected in a lake, Surrounded with a silver stream of light, I saw my lady's presence flame in sight, And, after, came a sense of roses cast In soft encompassing luxuriance fast Over my silent body, and a bright And strange unveiling of the spirit's form And immortality made visible: And death and sin and feebleness and hell, Being black, shone white beneath the fragrant storm Of snows that clothed her body sweet and warm, And every tower of separation fell. XLII. CLEANSING I dreamed a sudden dream, and was aware Of my lost goddess bending over me, And of some magic echo of the sea, And strange outpouring of remembered hair; And round me flowed, as an electric air Of crystal and surpassing purity, A woman's breath, and clothed exultantly My body in a raiment soft and fair. And every sin she lightly blew away, But as an easy flake of thistle-down That floats along the summer, winged and grey; And over me she placed a quiet crown Of hands, and brought my cheek beside the brown Same tresses,—and she taught me how to pray. XLIII LOVE'S ABILITIES Love came, and round about her played a sense Of life and heaven, and sweet and sinless sleep, And plains of golden corn a man might reap For ever, for there is not any fence, And powers of thought unresting and intense, And powers of love majestic,—even as deep As the blue dim Atlantic, and immense And lofty and eternal as the steep Of any Alpine summit crowned with snow; And powers of passion resolute and wild, Yet tender as the green and rosy glow Wherewith the sun, deserting us, has smiled, And gentle as a summer stream whose flow Is hindered by the crossing of a child. XLIV. BENEATH THE OAK I closed my eyes in winter; when I woke, Or seemed to wake, the trees were new and green, And many a flower was there, and glossy sheen Of insects, each resplendent in his cloak Of gorgeous summer, and the bird-choirs spoke,— And I heard a woman's voice that seemed to say —'Twill ring within me to my dying day— “Hasten, I wait for thee beneath the oak, I was expecting thee;” and never more Shall any other voice be strange and sweet As that was, though I search from shore to shore, From the blue Arctic icebergs to the heat Of the extreme South, and open every door, And try the hollows of each green retreat. XLV. THE SEA-PALACE In the fair days of youth I did behold One standing on the sea-shore, and her face Smote me with sudden rapture. Then that place O'er which the sea-wind travelled gaunt and cold Became as a sweet palace wrought of gold And chiselled into cunning lines of grace; And in its heart a fountain I could trace, And many a pillar of no mortal mould. And still, when I am wandering by the sea The wild winds beckon with a sudden tune, Bringing that palace back again to me, And the early crescent of love's rising moon: “Surely,” I whisper, “I shall meet her soon, And pass those palace-gates triumphantly.” XLVI. A DREAM OF SUNSET I dreamed I stood beneath a golden sunset, With idle breakers leaping on the sand In silver irresistible slow onset,— I watched the waving of my lady's hand, And sweet locks loosened in so many a band Fell over shoulders white as mountain snows Or the silver ripples sliding in to land; Her mouth was as the glory of a rose The day before its full refulgence blows, And all her figure seemed like some fair lily Rising and falling in a soft repose At even, swept by winds from regions hilly, And eyes were as the green-gold lamps that then Emerge, each gliding from a mossy den. XLVII. THE LOST GLORY Beyond the grave that passionate lost glory Shall surely, with white splendour, be revealed We left, a lily dead in love's fair field, And the threads of love's sweet intercepted story Shall be renewed,—although man's head be hoary Before the eternal lagging meadows yield And Perseus leap with perfect-polished shield From life's immeasurable promontory. Then, as Athene's lofty help uplifted The daring venture of that hero's head, The brave man's spirit shall be largely gifted With power whereby his ascent shall be sped: This mortal cloak of sorrow shall be shifted, And the heavenly satisfaction worn instead. XLVIII. “INTENSITY” “What shall I give him?” So a maiden said— “With brave pure labour he sang songs of me; What shall my final tear-touched token be, Now that he lies pale, voiceless, heedless, dead? Shall it be some ripe rose of loveliest red, Or snowdrop drooping petals tenderly, Or blue-grey valiant thistle from the sea Beside whose waves our wandering steps were led?” So doubted she: but then there came a voice, An audible direction from the air, Saying, “Thy first thought was the seemlier choice; No snow-white name I gave to him to bear, In no calm crown of lilies to rejoice, But my rose-wreathed intensity to share.” XLIX. FROM A WINDOW I gaze upon the night. Ah! thou art breathing The same sweet odours, the same gracious air; In thy pure locks the same night-winds are wreathing Scents delicate and flowery petals rare. The same calm holy stars do rest above us; The same moon glitters at the window-pane; The soul of the tender self-same God doth love us; We are refreshed alike by summer rain. Sleep sends upon us both her healing beauty, The eternal wings of sacred darkness brood Above us both,—we dream alike of duty, We grasp hands in the same nocturnal wood: The sweet night brings us close; the days divide A poet from his visionary bride. L. SWEET TWILIGHT When the sweet twilight comes, my soul doth enter A sweet place, hardly seen by shifting light, Whereof one glorious white form is the centre, As the clear moon is central orb of night. I cease to live alone, sad facts forsake me; I find a queenly gracious counterpart,— To her with reverent pleasure I betake me, Bringing the songful treasures of my heart. I am no more alone, my lady brings me Another self, a higher holier power: The tender reappearing twilight flings me A wave-washed shell towards the fragrant bower Wherein things seem divinely, grandly new, Robed in fair summer's unexpected hue. LI. THE ELEMENTAL KISS I give to thee the blessing of all flowers,— The sweetness lingering on the summer breeze, The music of all thunders and all seas, The passionate brightness of all red-rose bowers, The silver magic of love's moonlit hours, The soft sense of the greenness of the leas, And tender utterance of the buds of trees, And tender melody of the springtide showers. The blessing of the universe is thine,— This I thy poet for a guerdon give; Around thy perfect brows all flowers I twine; In these and in my songs thy soul shall live: When all loves else are passing to decay, Then, sweet, the dawning of our bridal day! LII. MY LADY'S SOUL My lady's soul is given to me to keep: It shall be mine with perfect triumph pure; With dawning revelation sweet and sure; With ecstasy unutterable and deep. Once all its glory flamed on me through sleep— But next in waking wonderment her soul Shall yield at once to mine, and mine control: Our spirits shall laugh as one, as one shall weep. This perfect passionate consummation waits, More glorious for all the sorrow past, Close hidden behind our sufferings' silent gates: My lady's look shall seek mine at the last. Then shall I reach the passionate soul within; Untouched—unstained:—left white for me to win. LIII. THE MAIDEN BLOSSOM For all her soul is maidenly and pure: It has not flowered—it is divine as yet With God's first blessing, with fresh dewdrops wet; The blossom waits for true love to secure. All sorrow passes from me, all regret, For now I know the paths of God are sure, And that the glances soft that once I met Are mine for ever,—so I but endure. All hardness therefore, in this perfect faith That so illumines and transfigures death, I can make light of, suffering to the end: Now that I know that holy God is true, Life's clouds have parted, and the glad bright blue Shows God's face as the lost face of a friend. LIV. MY PLUMES OF SONG Mine are the plumes of sound that shall uplift This viewless spirit of hers towards the sky; Yea, mine shall be the spirit itself: my gift. Again and yet again her soul shall try In its own sweet self-confidence to fly; Again and yet again her soul shall fail: She is not garbed in the immortal mail,— Nor can she, through fierce effort, soar on high. Then shall she come to me with humble face, Seeking the assistance of the singer's grace, And he shall lift her softly through the air: Oh when thou need'st me, and the moment comes In which thy flower of aspiration blooms, Nor look, nor call: unsought, I shall be there. LV. “I AM VERY FOND OF YOU” Words sweet, supremely perfect, and unending— Words that have reached my inmost spirit and made That spirit white and tender and deep,—soft-blending Passion's divine betrayal with the shade Of perfect purity as a veil descending To hide some fierce-flushed rosebud in a glade: Words that must keep my soul from e'er offending; Words that must bring my spirit eternal aid, For ever holiness and manhood lending; Words after which no death can make me afraid,— O peaceful girlish words—a calm extending That shall outlive the cold years' bitter raid; Words soft, pure, exquisite,—divinely strong,— I give the world your beauty;—in this song. LVI. THE CROWN In a great vision I beheld the Lord.— I saw his robes, his sceptre, and his rings, And all his heavenly store of wondrous things; His garments and his jewels and his sword. But what is this that some bright seraph brings, This wonder girded by a golden cord? Surely it is the crown the King of kings Alone doth wear,—chief marvel in his hoard. Eager I looked,—my soul was in a glow, For surely, thought I, this high God who scorns To mingle with the earth, more white than snow, More pure than woman, some strange wreath adorns;— I yearned and looked—and looked again—for lo! The crown was not of roses, but of thorns. LVII. CHIEFEST If any man would win a crown to last, First let his inmost spirit of love be pure,— First let him life's high mountain airs endure, And face the thunder, and the midnight blast. When this world's fiery seas are safely past There shall be pleasure and there shall be praise, And fame perhaps, and garlands of green bays, And recompence; but such flowers spring not fast. Who would be first, must fight the fight most hard; In labours and in sorrows must abound; Smooth things and easy must his soul discard; In battle's red front must his sword-stroke sound:— Who would be chiefest in the world's regard With the world's supreme sorrow must be crowned. LVIII. THE HIGHEST CROWN The highest anguish wears the highest crown; The deepest passion brings the best reward. Woman surrenders to the strongest sword And lays before that steel her sweet heart down. Yea, when the leaves of this life wax quite brown Or pale and sodden, true love 'gins to bloom— True love's pure petals sweetliest o'er the tomb Wave: then begins love's golden glad renown. When the grave closes all love's blossoms bright Tenderly tremble,—stretching towards the light The pure smooth petals, yea the firm long leaves: When life is stripped off like a raiment rent Love glows and blows, eternally content, And passion's hand ingathers lustrous sheaves. LIX. AN ENDLESS UNION What are the unions of the present?—poor And pallid, mere forlorn sick shades of love. When Beatrice kissed Dante from above Then first their joy shone, glorious to endure. The love that death can shorten or obscure Is not love,—love alone which hath no ending, For ever towards God's throne on sweet wings tending, Is love that touching, touches to secure. The lips of love may touch, the breasts may meet, And yet there shall be separation after; God's scorn and all heaven's high tempestuous laughter May round about such ghosts of lovers beat:— When first a union is for endless time, Then first it passionate is,—then first sublime. LX. SYMPATHY But sympathy can draw, though distance parts The lovers,—if a man can see, he holds The woman, and indisputably folds Her silent spirit to his heart of hearts. O'er starless space his conquering swift thought darts: Into his image all her shape he moulds; Though seas between them lie and barren wolds, And sunstruck deserts, at one sigh he starts. One gentle sigh can bring his spirit near, One look for help, one utterance of a fear, For he, he only of all men, understands: So, though as far divided as the poles In earthly distance, the sweet close-knit souls Lock equal indivisible white hands. LXI. THE MEADOW-SWEET OF HEAVEN I wrote of fragrant meadow-sweet of earth And mourned to think that last year's bloom had perished: So vanish all long love-thoughts that we've cherished, I deemed—yea, passion crumbles at its birth. I wandered through the woods,—the flowers were there, So soft, so tender—but they all belonged To that new season: all the flowers that thronged The woods of old had passed outside God's care. So thought I—and the thought was sad and cold; For I had loved those blossoms, and had striven, Mixing with fern their creamy plumes of old, In my love's brown locks joyous wreaths to fold:— The thought was sad: it passed; instead was given A bright glimpse of the meadow-sweet of heaven. LXII. THE SUDDEN SWEETNESS How soon thou know'st not,—yet it may be soon.— This high reward of holy expectation God sends; it outweighs years of tribulation,— It is a glorious and sufficient boon. A sudden splendour round me like a moon Grandly uprising from some silent sea May flame,—transfiguring unexpectedly: Hurling my soul towards heaven in one swift swoon. O lady, when thy kiss comes, be it through pain Or earthly terror, or this life's defeat, Or some protracted agonizing strain Of sorrow, when thy white wings round me beat, Though at thy touch this mortal self be slain, It may be sudden but it must be sweet. LXIII. TILL SHE COME O holy wondrous coming of the Lord That they expected—which they saw indeed, Though not according to their carnal creed Of trumpets, and a red avenger's sword— When all thy perfect glory was outpoured Upon the faithful watchers, what a meed Was theirs,—how utterly it did exceed Their suffering,—how transcendent the reward! Though all the cultured folk around them railed And mocked, their watchword in the end prevailed: Its winged breath was too forceful for the tomb. With the same patience I my lady's death Show forth,—I watch with hushed and solemn breath The clouds that hide her beauty—till she come. LXIV. BLESSED IS HE Blessed is he who tarrieth for the king.— And blessed is he who waiteth for his lady Through nights of suffering,—threading valleys shady And dim defiles of pain with lips that sing. Not yet the blue sky parts before her wing; Not yet the sun-bright angels round her throng As she descends,—the murky night is long; No pink clouds round the mountain-summits cling. But she shall come. Most blest of all is he Whom no most sudden sunrise can perturb; Who, when the rich dawn gilds the smallest herb Upon the mountain-side, can fearlessly Meet the full rapture of his lady's face, Not having flinched from his appointed place. LXV. ONE SILVER LAUGH If I could hear thy laughter, as of old It rang in early autumn through the woods, When berries of the mountain-ash, red-gold, We gathered—happy in youth's tearless moods: If only once again I could behold The happy girlish smile upon thy face, And watch thy figure in its girlish grace As then I watched,—my life's tale would be told. The mere delight, the joyous sense of this Pure vision would bring peace; it would be bliss Exceeding every agony of mine: I should be happy then: it is reward For me, worth every thrust of God's straight sword, To hear one tender silver laugh of thine. LXVI. AT NIGHT I struggle on through every weary day, Well knowing that at night a rest will come: That then I shall behold my blossom's bloom And count her new buds,—in the twilight grey. The hours of sunlight are to me a tomb Most piteous; but the darkness changes all; Then do I seek thee through the star-hung hall Of night, soft-guided by some strange perfume. The long days pierce me with a reckless sword; Their wild hours hustle me, they heed not how; Yet have I thee all anguish to allay. An ample and most exquisite reward Is thy sweet kiss that lights upon my brow After the agony of another day. LXVII. THE SLEEPER Thou art asleep: thou dost not know me yet: A stranger am I till the soul awakes. The body has wide eyes, and it partakes Of human cares—knows pity and regret, Joy, sorrow, tenderness,—but firmly set, Tight fastened are the eyelids of the soul. It sleeps deep, deep within,—and swift months roll Far past it,—but no day-dawn has been met. I wait—in utter patience. Soul that sleepest, When one fair tear shall show me that thou weepest, These songs shall touch the closed lids of thine eyes: And wet with that tear drawn from underneath Those maiden lids, shall lift thee, as from death, Saying—Thou hast slept long enough. Arise! LXVIII. ROSES FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE Sweet blossoms many and fair I sought to bring; Some plucked in hedges, some in wild wet woods,— Some gathered in weird pathless solitudes Where the lone eagle is unquestioned king. I wove for thee the supple stems that cling Round garden-bowers; strange splendid flowers I brought From tropic lands,—through English vales I sought, And through the groves where English throstles sing. All these I wove, my lady, in a crown For thee—thee only,—if so I might add To thy fair fame and glory, and make thee glad With some fresh token of a wide renown:— Yet then I thought enough had not been given, And sought to bring thee roses culled in heaven. LXIX. THY SWEET SORROW It is thy sorrow, lady, that at last Shall amply and with certitude repay: My cross shall draw thee towards me,—thou shalt say, “I nailed him there, my folly nailed him fast To this accursed wood one bitter day Far-off but unforgotten in our past: I drove the nails in, while he gazed aghast; Then left him there to wear the years away.” When thou dost see and say this gracious thing, Self-sentenced, sad, repentant,—when thine eyes Look large and lovely as the great drops rise Therein, and round the downcast lashes cling, Those tears shall be as pearls within my crown, Adding soft lustre,—doubling my renown. LXX. YOUR WATCHING AS WELL I do your watching, sweet, and mine besides;— I bear for you the burden of the years; If e'er your tender face is wet with tears, Adown my own an answering teardrop glides. Your sorrow through my veins in swift true tides Pulses along; your doubts and pangs and fears Are my doubts also and my pains;—what clears Your own horizon, hope for me provides. You watch within the garden; teardrops fall Upon the leaves and flowers,—I am this rose Whose petals your soft tears do discompose; In my red perfumed cup I gather all: I watch with you, a true flower, through the night, Sharing all sorrow,—as I share delight. LXXI. GOD'S HOLY FIRE Upon me at some seasons there descends The fire of God to purge thee of thine error,— Through thunder and through anguish and through terror To draw thee back towards nobler queenlier ends. The Spirit of God in flaming glory blends Its power with mine, and bids me speak to thee; Yea, could I, without fieriest anger, see That weakness late repentance barely mends? There is in me the holy fire of God, To purge each furrow of the slavish sod Of thine own fickle and rebellious heart; There is in me an agony supreme At thine own sin, and so a saving stream Of sweet divine redemption I impart. LXXII. FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH Though joys of heaven around me in a throng Should glitter,—though the past might far away Fade, like the evening of a stormy day When darkness gathers quickly,—though the strong Delights of heaven might make the earth wax cold In thought, and e'en the memory of my song Like something far behind, forgotten and old,— Yet one remembrance no deep joy could wrong. I still should see thee, as I saw thee first, When first I knew mine own eternal queen And felt the insatiable and ardent thirst Of passion:—the sweet girlish face, serene With placid thoughts in sunniest leisure nursed; The gentle perfect maiden of sixteen. LXXIII. THE NARROW GATE The road of pain and sorrow I pursue, That so thine eyes may meet mine in the end:— That thou mayst upward readily ascend, My hair is wet with watching 'mid the dew Of frequent nights; that thou mayst hasten through The narrow gate, I stand beside and keep My eyes, though heavy, from the aggressive sleep— That I may aid thy toil with weapon true. Because the gate is strait, I will be there,— Ready to help thee, ready forth to fare That I may bring thy steps along the road: Because the path is terrible and dire I straightway seek it—with redoubled fire— Secure that it conducts towards Love's abode. LXXIV. THE FIRST TRUE BLOSSOMING Far, far away from sympathy no flower Can spread sweet petals into utmost bloom: Her own desires, unanswered, must consume The struggling pallid bud from hour to hour. Not by the summer sun, by no spring shower, Shall all the inner marvellous perfume Be drawn to light; it lingers in a tomb, Cold, sad, remorseless,—lacking joy and power. But some day comes a heart that understands; He takes the tender stalk in yearning hands; At one quick glance he apprehends the whole:— Then touched by softer breezes, friendlier gales, The sweet rose buds,—next blossoms, and exhales The lavish perfume of her inmost soul. LXXV. THE WIDE SYMPATHY We sympathize by chance with one or two; We bear the sorrows, maybe, of a friend; But there our power of sympathy doth end,— Its fountain we are forceless to renew. A great man through the world his heart may send, Nobly partake in many a purpose true,— Yet silent agonies o'er some impend,— Sorrows there are earth's greatest ne'er passed through. The sympathy of human hearts may fail After a time; our noblest is but pale With partial sorrow,—Christ's sad eyes were dim For every sufferer—this was his renown: This was his utter victory. Yea, to him 'Twas given to wear all sorrows like a crown. LXXVI. THE TRANSFIGURING TOUCH When thou dost lay thine hand upon a thing It gleams for ever, glorified and new,— For round thee some magnetic robe doth cling Which from each flower extracts its secret true. The daisies at the touching of thy wing, As if fresh-bathed in lavish evening dew, Dart forth pink sweeter petals;—passing through The meadows, choirs of birds about thee sing. I praise all holy gifts, when thee I praise,— For all the boons thou grantest me are such. Treading behind thee, in Christ's heavenlit ways I tread; I seek thy footpath, wondering much; All common joys, transfiguring, thou dost raise, Making them everlasting by thy touch. LXXVII. BLOW ON BLOW O puny suffering querulous soul of mine, Be still now, be at peace,—be not so sad: Think'st thou this thorn-wreath God has let thee twine Is the first wreath the spirit of man has had? Have there been sufferers none with sorrow mad? Are there no sufferers now whose days decline Slowly, while thou dost gather from life's vine Some grapes at least, with healthful hands and glad?— Or, if thou sufferest more than others, know That, long before thou wast to suffering born, Fierce throbs of bitterest pain through God did flow,— That he was left most utterly forlorn,— Encountered hostile spear-strokes, blow on blow, And strokes of friends more grievous, scorn on scorn. LXXVIII. THE LAST RIDGE The end approaches. Like a traveller pale With strong protracted labour, I rejoice: Soon may I hush my strained and weary voice And fold my rest about me, like a veil. Soon “It is finished” may I utter, standing Nigh the last weary peak I have to assail: Soon may I, tender Beatrice commanding, Strip off my blood-bedewed war-beaten mail. Close to the end of battle now I stand, Holding my conquest almost in mine hand,— With Beatrice almost before my eyes;— My spirit clears itself triumphantly And climbs to the last ridge, whence now I see Death's sunset, which to me is life's sunrise. LXXIX. THE FACE DIVINE I had sweet visions of the face divine; Sometimes a woman's face it was, and tender— Yearning forgivingly o'er each offender, With pity softening every perfect line. Again it was a strong man's face,—and fine With thought and ardent labour; crowned with flowers I saw it next,—moist buds of eglantine, And roses plucked from summer-coloured bowers. Then came a season dark—the face no more Shone near me; it had vanished, and I dreamed That every vision of the Lord was o'er; Yet forth again, sun-bright, the great face gleamed,— Sun-bright, but as the sun through clouds appears, For lo! the face divine was wet with tears. LXXX. UTTERLY ALONE Alone at last we shall be. Then thine eyes Shall be the light that lights us on our way; Thy face the glory of the perfect day; Thy beauty the soft splendour of sunrise. All other loves shall fade. Far past us flies Sorrow, a bird on pinions gaunt and grey. The earthly sun is setting, but its ray Is faint by that great fire that Love supplies. Alone, alone, no mortal near us—air Above us and around us: all the scars Of life are healing; now no lingering care With sword perverse enfeebles us and mars. I am alone with thee, thou woman fair,— Thee only, and God's presence, and the stars. PART III HEAVEN ON EARTH LXXXI. NOW Now that I pass towards the pure Ideal, All earthly things are sanctified and white; Now that I live as in my Lady's sight, Superb imaginations crown the real. I am happy now: before me shines the right,— Sweet to pursue, a gracious flag to follow: All lesser lamps are glow-worms in a hollow, By Purity's unutterable light. I seek my Lady now with tender pleasure, With hands made bold and spirit undefiled; Happy I am as in the golden leisure Of early love,—no more perverse and wild; I love beyond all words, beyond all measure, With laughter like the laughter of a child. LXXXII. IN ALL STARS AND FLOWERS In stars and flowers I see my Lady now;— Now in the violets blue her glances shine, Her mouth is hidden amid the eglantine,— The lilies are the whiteness of her brow. The simplest bud is beautiful to me, O never-ending love of mine, O lady, Because of thine own beauty!—Yea, for thee Red roses blush in garden-alleys shady. The world of flowers is thine: all gathered posies Are symbols of the rich eternal roses That bloom around the richness of thine heart. All snowdrops and all buds of lily-brightness Are but as signs of thine imperial whiteness,— Yea, whiter than God's whitest rose thou art. LXXXIII. AN OLD OLD SPIRIT Thou art an old spirit,—thou dost belong To some far different place and other days; Thou heardest perhaps in Paradise the praise I give thee, smiling at my love-taught song. Upon the ancient winds thou hast been strong; Thou hast sailed wide upon the ocean-ways; In far forgotten epochs just such lays Of passion at my eager lips did throng. Upon this earth again thou hast been born, But of thine earthly parents thou art not: Destined for some diviner grander lot Thou art; from some soul-sphere thou hast been torn; Thy spirit, incarnate in thy baby-cot, Left sister-angels for thy loss to mourn. LXXXIV. THE MARRIAGE IN MUSIC O Beatrice, my lady,—yea, my queen,— When I hear music I am one with thee, And one with some high heavenly life serene. The marvellous piercing sound transfigures me; All sorrows vanish,—all the woes between; Thy whiteness leads me like a white fair star Rising with solemn purport from afar, Silver above broad endless billows green. The star of thy pure whiteness glittereth so, Lighting life's tideway with sweet silver glow Till all the trembling waves are mute and bright: Thy glory around me gleameth:—as of old Life's waters all were tinged with magic gold When first the sun of first love rose in might. LXXXV. JOINED, NOT BLENDED Joined, yet not hopelessly confused or blended, Shall spirit-lovers in their union be. If one fair shape were lost, desire were ended,— Then would ensue unglad satiety. High individual power shall be extended; Though two are one, yet separate thoughts shall mingle, As through the spirit-lips the rich throbs tingle,— The thoughts that here on separate forms depended. Not mixed, not swallowed up, but grand as ever Shall be the spirit-body of my bride. Not brought too near to kiss, the sweet eyes never Obscured, but brightened rather,—deified; The sweet lips still a separate perfect flower; The pure mind still an independent power. LXXXVI. WITH BEATRICE IN GOD My life is hid with Beatrice in God,— And hidden with her in all things sweet as well; In every flower whereon her footstep fell, Each rose rich-blushing on the sunny sod. She, being sweet, can clothe my soul with sweetness And subtle mystic power too fair to tell, And all poetic passionate completeness; She, being glad, can lift from sorrow's hell. My life is hid with Beatrice in pleasure,— My life is hid with her beyond the sky: My fair delight, my love, my sweet-winged treasure, The utter gift of God, she is; and I With tender worship passing tenderest measure In music thus to Music's self reply. LXXXVII. NOW, HAVING SEEN THEE Now, having seen thee, all my song is ended,— I care no more for words, now once again Thy sweet face, sadder, but as fair as when First with love's vision it so softly blended, Has met and crowned me; when we breathe quite close, We do not sing the beauty of the rose,— There's hardly room now, left between our lips, E'en for this song, as forth the flutterer slips! I cannot speak of mine own soul; and thou Art mine, my lady:—when the souls are one, The long, long task of separate praise is done; Thy glance has brought completion to my vow,— The gaze that bade me sing, now bids me cease; The look that worked me woe, now grants me peace. LXXXVIII. SWEETER, LESS AWFUL Something of the awe has vanished from my strain, It may be; now that thou art wholly near It is a softer task to sing thee, dear; There is not the old yearning, nor the pain. We cannot crave the rose that we retain In our own hands, made fragrant from the touch: We cannot long for present joys so much As for the gifts no passionate prayer could gain. O white rose, perfect lady of my song, Desired and sought and struggled for so long, Now that thy petals sweet within my clasp Abide, the passionate agony is over, Thank God!—the happy calm soul of thy lover Pants not for that which rests within his grasp. LXXXIX. THROUGH TROPIC WOODS I am as one who, threading tropic woods The first time, wondered at the marvels fair That met his yearning vision everywhere Through the green splendid tangled solitudes,— Who worshipped in that dense and torrid air Some wonderful white blossom by the way, Ready to kiss with tender lips each spray That laughed beneath the blue heavens' burning glare. Just as he worshipped wildly,—yet at last, When the sweet days of distant awe were past, Plucked tenderly the blossom for his own,— So hold I now my snow-white bud too near For the old tremulous glance, the old sweet fear, Since worship into living love has grown. XC. YET DEEPER Yet deeper is my passionate tenderness. The nearer that thou art, the more thine eyes Are ever to me, love, a sweet surprise; Purer than fancy's is thy warm caress. If at a distance I had cause to bless, What shall I say now that God's bluest skies Of cordial summer, deep with ecstasies, Beam round me, freed for e'er from each distress? Oh whiter than the soul of which I dreamed Is this thine own soul, now its wealth has gleamed Upon me, brought by God for ever close; Sweeter the body of wonder I adored, Now that sweet love, our guardian and our lord, Has given to me that wonderful white rose. XCI. THE SUMMER The spring has passed,—the spring-time of my strain, The spring of thy fair life. Now summer round us Beams, and the laughing-eyed swift loves have found us Who gaily tread in his impassioned train. Thine hair is fragrant with the smell of flowers Still,—but no flowers of simpler spring remain; Still art thou beauteous as in those first hours Of love,—but no lost hours again we gain. We pass towards perfect summer. Our delight Is hidden for us among the full-leaved trees, And 'mid the passion of the August night, And by the moonlit wonderful still seas Of August. Thine imperial face is bright With summer thoughts and ripest ecstasies. XCII. I AM CONTENT I am content; I twine thy deep dark hair With August flowers: the meadow-sweet I bring That long ago in sorrow I did sing, Ere love renewed for me his music fair. Thou passest through me like some viewless air Of summer, touching with thy fragrant wing My lips and eyes: white blossoms round thee cling, Whiter than e'en our snowiest May can bear. The marvellous perfume of the old lost dream Again pervades me; once again some flower Ne'er known on earth, but whose white petals gleam Perhaps in some redolent angelic bower, Wraps me in speechless scent,—and, as of old, Thy white arms, shuddering softly, round me fold. XCIII. MY OWN FOR EVER “My lady of the rosebands and the bays, My dimple, and my soft caressing” speech; My pure eternal unforgotten “ways,” My smiles, with sonnet-plumage hid in each: “My sweet hair still divinely downward streaming,” My hands so soft and wonderful and white; My mind with delicate love-fancies teeming, My glance of heavenly and most sacred light: My lips so pure and red, so sweet and tender, My heart so glad and great, so deep and warm; My silver voice, to which love did surrender, My breast, white as a sea-bird's thro' a storm:— For ever and for ever, though they fled, All these are mine,—now selfish love lies dead. XCIV. THE LIFE OF MUSIC The boundless life of music now at times Descends upon us:—lo! we form a part Of music's wide unutterable heart, And mix, in rapture, with the eternal rhymes. We traverse, in a dream, strange spirit-climes; We hear strange oceans beating on white shores; We thread strange rivers to the plash of oars Unearthly, ringing round us silvery chimes. The spirit of music lifts us,—and our love Becomes a passion every change above: The spirit of music aids us, and its fire Is one with us in one intense desire: The spirit of music bears us towards that sea Whose blue waves murmur—“Immortality.” XCV. THOU, AND THE FLOWERS Thou art eternal, and thy flowers as well.— The gold-brown ripples curling by the banks Of Esk,—the meadow-sweet in tufted ranks,— The vast eternal ocean's moonlit swell,— The purple heather broidering moor and fell,— The green rich grass,—the blossoms by the way,— All that Love saw in Love's one perfect day,— The yellow laughing corn,—the fern-lined dell:— All these for ever, though we pass, abide: The grey or green cliffs sloping to the tide; The great black ships that clove the yielding deep; The stars that over us pure watch did keep; All these are in my song:—and thou art there, Tender to me alone,—to all hearts fair. XCVI. BY ALL THE STRENGTH OF SONG By all the strength of holy song I swear Thou shalt not be forgotten—thy sweet eyes Shall shine for ever on the world; more fair And everlasting with each new sunrise Thou shalt be; at the wonder of thine hair Women shall wonder,—and thy snow-white hands Like Helen's, shall bring gifts to many lands,— Nor shall thy name forsake the English air. O English lady, fair white English rose Breathed upon gently by the northern wind, Thee from thine empire time shall not depose. Thou shalt in every noble English mind Blossom for ever: through my music glows Thy flower-face, there indelibly designed. XCVII. THE OLD RAPTURE Now, every time that music sends its dream, Winged like an angel, o'er the listening skies, I meet, eternal love, thy full clear eyes, And pass into the old ecstatic stream Of thoughts that God's sweet vivid hand supplies. The old flower-rapture, fragrant, is around My spirit, snatching it from earthly ground,— Towards heavenly hills on flower-soft wings I rise. The great immortal yearning soul within Yearns like a wrestling giant, and it shakes The body terribly,—and it forsakes The earth, and all earth's joys and soulless din, And seeks the regions where the eternal streams, Like lilies on their ripples, lift love's dreams. XCVIII. FAR, FAR AWAY Far, far away I bear thee—towards new fields Of wondrous thought; oh, bid the gentle flowers Of earth farewell—bid farewell to the bowers Of youth, and all that common pleasure yields: Prepare to traverse the immortal plains With me,—with me to watch the swift-winged hours,— With me to enter into what remains Of perfect rest: thy past keen time devours. Behold, the skies are wonderful in hue, The dawn is on the mountains, deepening blue,— Great spirits with thee on God's hill-tops tread: Come: enter into heaven, O fairest flower Therein,—I give thee that angelic power,— The immortal wreath I twine around thy head. XCIX. TO GREAT SPIRITS I bring thee to the spirits of all the past: To Dante and to Shelley, and to each Whose gift of high imperishable speech Has made on earth their sacred memories last. Before thee, lo! their glittering crowns they cast— Higher than theirs the throne that thou shalt reach: Sweeter the wonders that thou hast to teach: Grander thy victory, and thy realm more vast. Thou art the fairest flower of all the flowers Poets have sung of with bright burning lips: Their beauty my white blossom doth eclipse: They are as leaves, as branches, on thy bowers,— Thou art the one eternal rose that shines Beyond all wreaths the spirit of passion twines. C. FAR FROM ALL SMALLNESS Far from all smallness towards the eternal hills Of highest Art I lift thee:—thou hast been As one who, childlike, 'mid the meadows green Plays, bathing white feet in earth's murmuring rills. But now her mission holy Art fulfils,— She calls thee forth to be an endless queen. Forsake all lower thoughts; with happy mien List to the song whose passion through thee thrills! Thy days of earth are over: come with me, And watch the stars, and hearken to the sea, Whose every solemn wave doth whisper “Thee.” The moon above the waters rises slow— Sweeter than dreams around us is the flow Of silver streamlets:—Love waits; let us go! Christmas Day, 1876. LOVE SLAIN, YET RISEN (1871) I. THE OLD GREEN ARCHWAY The old sleep-spectres would have passed away, Had you been gracious, sweet. I should have slept, And woke and smiled, and woke again and wept, Too peaceful and too close to God to pray, Your bosom being God-gifted to convey The sense of sweet security to me:— I should have found his soft repose in thee, And sunk in heaven deeper day by day. But heaven on earth is given to but few To linger in,—I have seen it,—it is good But it has vanished;—when it comes in view, I know that I shall feel as if I stood In the old green archway of that autumn wood, And the first sweet angel-vision will be—you. II. THE SENSE OF DEATH The sense of death is nothing;—for it brings A perfect vision of things seen already. I recognise with eyesight cleansed and steady A gold-clad chorus of familiar things, And feel the fluttering of your sweet wings And touching of your hands,—and your glad breath Makes a rose-garden of the vale of death, And heaven it is for your glad voice that sings. God, this is nothing new. I passed, before, The gate of death,—and felt upon my face The subtle airs of heaven, and the grace And golden glamour of the open door That leads to the eternal unbound shore,— When hand in hand of mine She came to place. III. GOD'S WOMAN-HEART God having given Love, it cannot be That he should take it. I am calm to wait Till as a rosebud at his palace-gate That unforgotten face of her I see,— For this and nothing else shall come to me, In this life or the next, or soon or late:— I fall into the outspread arms of fate, And—find they are the pleasant arms of thee! Does God in heaven seek love and sigh for praise? Neither is his from me, being left forlorn. For so the double heart of God is torn Asunder; and for any song I raise, Deprived of his sweet tender winning ways, It had been better had I not been born. IV. MY ROSE In the fair garden occupied by those Loved of the poets, I would place my queen,— And very sure am I there hath not been Upon the grass-plots any statelier rose;— That in that garden not a blossom blows With sweeter scent, or more abundant sheen Of flawless petals,—that amidst the green No tenderer bud of fiery crimson glows. There she shall stand for ever:—and when I Am dead, and she forgets my very name, My soul shall not forget to leave the sky And bend above her in the sun's red flame And soothe her with soft showers,—unknown to her My presence shall perpetually be nigh. TO BEATRICE TWENTY SONNETS I. THE PROGRESS OF PASSION Ah me, how I love Womanhood! the wonder, The dream-delight, that round their being clings,— The eyes that shatter, and the touch that stings:— The power that lives in lightning and in thunder, That flies from out the storm-cloud torn asunder, Resides, believe me, in these fairy things, In daintiest maiden fair that sits and sings; Clasp palms,—the electric shock shall rush from under. For me the wonder wanes not, but increases: A stern belief I'm holding as mine own,— That only in the bud, in broken pieces, Has love of man and woman yet been known; That time it is, when earthly passion ceases, To hurl the planet from her central throne. 1870. II. UNDIVIDED SERVICE We have to give her eyes, and hearts, and hands, Sweet poet-brothers, lovers of my soul; We have to crown her with the living whole Of power that each in his degree commands. Silent and smiling before each she stands, Ready to lay cool palms upon his brow If only he will swear allegiance now, Renouncing love of home, and life, and lands, Renouncing popularity and praise And great laudation of most petty minds And all the vulgar hubbub of the ways;— The man that doth this thing most surely finds The earth as fresh as when, drawing up the blinds, Upon a rain-washed summer morn we gaze. 1870. III. WHITE White, when I saw you last, with eyes as clear As ocean in the summer over sand, Your face was,—when I pressed your cold sweet hand. I did not know it was the last time, dear, And so another sonnet-pressure here I send,—the last wave washed upon the strand,— Last cry from darkness towards the sunlit land,— Last petal of the last rose of the year. The last long wailing of a harpsichord,— Last struggle, last spent sobbing, of a flute,— Last broken iridescence of a lute,— Last gleam and snapping of a singer's sword; Last surge of passion round about you poured; Last sunset-lustre on love's golden fruit. 1871. IV. GOD'S SCORN Beautiful scorn of God! as gently poured Upon the sinner as a summer dew, Yet having power to penetrate him through With swift incision of a two-edged sword;— Thou sweet and subtle terror of the Lord, Having a woman's face, and just as tender In the end to every soured and frail offender As is a maiden in her mute award Of final free forgiveness to her lover,— As beautiful as are her tearful eyes When lashes and the red lids gently rise Peace and her vanished anger to discover,— We dread thee not, for, storms and shadows over, Comes summer, and the blue caress of skies. 1871. V. “BICÉ” Not “Beatricé,” rather “Bicé”:—I Was ignorant of Dante's heart until The soft diminutive my heart did thrill With tender lips and a caressing sigh. For Beatricé might a warrior die,— For Bicé it was that Dante lived to fill The ages with a voice, and stamp his will, Regnant, on all Italian destiny. For Bicé the stern eyes were large with light And stern lips softly luminous with song; For her, like some melodious eagle's flight, His deathless wingéd poem passed along The clouds, before all listening peoples' sight:— For her the eternal toil-worn hands waxed strong. 1871. VI. SAD SONNETS Sad sonnets written while a wild hope lasted, I kiss your eyes, and give you subtle wings, That towards the distance of blue previous things Your plumes may hasten: while I fought and fasted And triumphed, these were written,—now, dismasted, Around my soul the white foam-fever clings, And in my ears the chant sonorous rings Of waves that break the ship's hull bent and blasted. But these were written while a hope remained,— Wild, unfledged, a young eaglet in a dream,— And while as yet a madman's eyes were strained Through mists wherein strange answering glances gleam; Written before the soft red sweet lips spoke, By the strong heart that loved them,—till it broke. 1871. VII. “WHAT HAS BEEN, IS” What has been, is. I have lost my rose, and yet I know that, if a rose-bloom God there be, That rose of his sweet nurture I shall see And with the former love my lids be wet,— And that the wings of passion-fed regret Shall part, and glisten into air, and flee;— And that she shall be tender unto me, And that these eyes shall meet the eyes I met On that far seashore in the sweet old days In some rose-haunted nook of heaven again. Be it how it may, no other hand can raise My forehead in the grasses of wan pain Sunk deep,—and, if for ever I remain Alive, no other woman will I praise. 1871. VIII. DIVINELY “VICTRIX” I dreamed my love was aged and infirm, An autumn rose with desolated leaves; But now my waking truer sight perceives Its beauty is but as a crimson germ. The winds that shook my blossom for a term Depart,—and, having cleansed away the brown And faded petals, leave my flower's crown Divinely “victrix” over winter's worm. Over the past I run a rapid eye— Over the tuneful work that I have done,— And, where I thought love's silver waves were dry, Behold a golden streamlet just begun; See, for a perished moon, a mounting sun; For grey despondent clouds, a fervid sky! 1871. IX. ONE NIGHT One night she came,—like a strange dream-born flower,— And sprinkled many a petal on the floor, And stood between me and the close-shut door, Awful in her excess of maiden power. And even as a green delightful bower The chamber was;—her softness seemed to steep My spirit in wondrous depths of magic sleep, And time fell dead,—hour floated after hour. Then force immortal lifted either soul, And hand in hand through dark wild solitudes And green recesses of moon-lighted woods We wandered; for some fairy seemed to roll The yielding walls aside,—and sorrows stole Away like ghosts with white averted hoods. 1871. X. OLD POEMS Old poems lay before me,—and I knew Again the floating dreams of early days Which led me captive underneath the blaze Of summer, when the sea was wide and blue In front,—the cliff beneath me,—and when you Walked as a queen along those windy ways, And held towards me a sweet crown of bays Wet with Youth's crystal sinless globes of dew. Now for the morning the calm sunset shines Before me,—and the sun's remorseless eye Is red between tall pillars of black pines Wherethrough I have to travel by and bye; Marching alone through their imposing lines, Dim, vast, and imperturbable, and high. Dec. 24, 1871. XI. ONE BY ONE The loves depart and vanish, one by one, Like women gathering up receding gowns And smiling into night,—and their gold crowns Are as the stormy setting of a sun Over whose shuddering face the damp clouds run, And finger and distress him till he drowns; And their red roses like short flowers on downs, And their gold garments even as cobwebs spun, And their gold tresses as the horrid locks Of some dispersed and slippery cold weed Clinging in brown flat coils upon the rocks, And kisses only as the floating seed The thistle gives to air,—and as coarse stocks The blossoms where our passions used to feed. Dec. 24, 1871. XII. A GREEN ARCADE My spirit revelled in a green arcade And felt the motion and the bloom of flowers,— The feathery cool despondence of the shade, The joy of rivulets in summer showers, And the inner sense of passion's secret bowers: And then there came a maiden and she said, “I dwell beyond the immortal blue-tipped towers And valleys tenanted by the extreme dead Where the perpetual swift sun's rays are red, And, long before the mystery of birth, These eyes that shine like emeralds in my head Flashed upon thine with laughter and quick mirth;— Before thy first infantine whisper fell, I was thine immemorial Isobelle.” 1872. XIII. FROM SPRING TO AUTUMN My love was lost: 'twas in the early spring,— But so divine a sunset-flame attended The loss of that immeasurable thing That even with autumn the sweet colours blended, And at cold Christmas snows were hardly ended, Illuminating the void current year And every leaf and flower and fruit suspended Within its grasp;—so, on an evening clear, A crimson sunset brings the distance near And through long minutes its sweet bloom pervades The woods, till like a cold and crystal tear The silver moon streams lightly o'er the shades,— And then the last red flame of sunset goes, Like the last heavenly petal of a rose. 1872. XIV. BEYOND THE ETERNAL HILLS But surely, far beyond the eternal hills And the slow river that pale men revere More than earth's quiet violet-girdled rills, Shall love and all things doubtful be made clear. Earth's autumn, red and solemn and austere, Shall blossom into green May-scented spring, And the opening of a green eternal year Arouse the happy praise of everything;— Then shall the hills and heaven's copses ring With notes of throstles that were broken-hearted, And whistle of nightingales too weak to sing When love and all love's music had departed; Then shall the faces of our passions shine Like angels in a golden endless line. 1872. XV. FINAL RESURRECTION I know that yet again my love shall rise And spurn the timid shadows and the gloom, Bursting the bars of the unavailing tomb And seeking birdlike the eternal skies. Then shall I know the truth of each surmise,— And every faint remotest intuition Shall shine before me in an open vision, When the close roof of life no more denies. Beyond the extreme blue haze of sunset hills There lies a recompence for every soul,— A recompence for even extremest ills:— Beyond those mountain-tops my Lady stole, And from behind those barriers, when she wills, She shall appear,—to make the enfeebled whole. 1874. XVI. THE TRUE PURE POSSESSION The true possession is the holy sense Of love and of ecstatic victory. Such true possession, love, was given to me:— A glory of triumph tenderly intense. A passion without envy or offence Was mine,—and that clear passion's blest reward Was the achievement of a golden sword That severed all the barriers dark and dense. One night when thou wast reading of my love, My yearning drew thee,—and thy spirit came, Like a white-winged and golden-crested dove, With plumage touched by passion as by flame: And that night all the road between us lay Open as meadows where glad children play. 1875. XVII. THE BURNING GLARE No friend shall follow and face the burning glare Of thought, in those fierce realms towards which I lead: No lesser love shall triumph, or succeed In breathing that divine sun-stricken air. Yet well and tenderly my sweet shall fare;— She shall not thirst,—her white foot shall not bleed,— She shall not pant for brook or flowery mead: Love is enough,—and Love's fount shall be there. Love's silver waters tender and divine Shall spring around us at this staff of mine,— The stroke of this my living staff of song: So, through the parched-up desert as we go, Sweet brooks of recompence shall round us flow, And never one day's journey shall seem long. 1876. XVIII. STILL SWEETER THINGS Although the flower of fancy is most sweet, There are still better sweeter things to come,— The beauty of a rose in perfect bloom; Not fancied, real; not partial, complete. Passion, made fact, transcends the ideal heat Of passion,—as one summer day's perfume Of countless flowers could utterly consume Spring-scents of months, not in themselves unmeet. Beyond the glorious dream I see the fact More glorious,—mark the joy more glorious still Than any sweet hope falling short of act, With nought to lift it but the dreamer's will,— And that too often pained, distorted, racked By suffering,—towards the heaven it fails to fill. 1876. XIX. REAL JOYS No vision, sweet but formless, shall be mine: No vision, pale and bloodless, in the end. Thine own bright soul the Lord of Love shall send With mine own spirit to mingle and combine, Forming one spirit imperishable, divine, Serene, superb, ecstatic. Friend from friend Must sever,—but our wedded hearts shall blend Till all my thoughts and hopes are one with thine. The real undreamed-of joys of thine embrace, And all the glory of thy passionate face, I then shall win: and pass beyond regret. I tarry for that ultimate high grace Which round me robes of victory shall place, And on my forehead starry triumph set. 1876. XX. INVINCIBLE Because I know that I can reach thee quite And draw thy heart to my heart by a word,— Because thy sun-compelling glance of light, Tender for me, thy secret hath averred,— Because the winds and the eternal night Brow-wreathed with stars, our passion's voice have heard,— Because the old strange dream is ever bright And valid, though the months and years have erred,— Because God, when he gives, will give with might, In that so long our rapture he deferred,— Because two meetings have sunk out of sight, But time himself shall tremble at our third:— Because this is the truth, our souls defy Grief's serried spears and death's malignity. 1876. LOVE-SONNETS I. A POET'S PRAYER O Beauty, Maiden Goddess, hear my cry! I bow my being and before thee kneel; From men and women I to thee appeal; Give me the power to give thy foes the lie, To set my teeth and front them and reply. Thy virgin glory they from thee would steal: Enraptured worship such men cannot feel; They still preserve the utterance of the stye. O Thou that dwellest in the ether, hear me, And cover me with sunset as a shield: Stand forth before me, Beauty, thou shalt clear me! Grant me to utter what thou hast revealed; Pour purity throughout me,—aid me, cheer me; Then snatch me up into thine azure field. 1870. II. HEAVEN AND HELL I woke, having dreamed that I was left alone, And timidly outstretched a searching hand And searching eyes,—but felt that I was fanned By the breath of morning, and a silver tone Came sweet to reassure me.—Ah! mine own, What a reaction had God's genius planned! What an uplifting from the murky land Into green meadows softly overblown! And then I knew the difference was this,— Just this swift difference and nothing more,— Between hell's horror and the silver shore Of heaven; even that between the bliss Of being loved and lips I thought no kiss Would ever teach to wonder and adore. 1871. III. GOD'S HEART My eyes were sweetly opened, and I knew The mystery of Marriage:—and, behold, God's heart I had the power to unfold And bring its inmost chambers into view; And treasures many beautiful and new I found therein, and memories fair and old,— Loves silver,—plumes and diadems of gold,— And frosts,—and summer seasons set in blue. But in the centre bloomed two roses,—one Being red, the other white: and these were set Therein for ever, lest a man forget That in God's heart the sweet dream first begun That we call Marriage,—and I knew that none Of God's thoughts had surpassed this Poem yet. 1871. IV. SWEET DEATH Sweet Death that hast the golden-coloured wings, Thou art not very far from any one,— And it may be before to-morrow's sun New warmth to the glad laughing green earth brings, Filling bright trees with many a throat that sings, A calm abode of peace may be begun For me, whereover soon shall climb and run The robe that o'er the dead soft Nature flings. And it may be that I shall be aware Of some old music, some forgotten tale, Some delicate old trembling in the air: And it may be that I shall rise and sail Majestic on the beats of pinions fair, Clothed valiantly in an immortal mail. 1871. V. THE PERFUME OF THE SOUL There are seasons when the fragrant soul within Leaps, as a yearning child within the womb, And shakes the fleshly fences of its tomb,— Eager to mount, and rustle, and begin A life delivered from the fangs of sin And these slow fleshly fires that do consume:— And then the sweet soul flings a strange perfume From limbs that move and struggle, and we win At times a wild intoxicating sense Of the large life of deathland,—that shall be One meadow of sweet ether with no fence, One imperturbable unbounded sea Wherein the soul shall revel, winged and free, Exulting in a magnitude intense. 1871. VI. WHEN AND WHERE? When shall we meet, my lost delight, and where? What regions have the flowers of thy feet Made odorous, or what hazy heights of air Have trembled o'er thine hands in kisses sweet? What heaven shines with gold increase of light, What clouds are touched to music at thy tone,— What myrmidons angelic, mailed in might, Are humble worshippers of thee, mine own? And dost thou sail through balmy sunset seas, Clothed with the vapours that incarnadine The tender outpoured ringlets of the breeze? Ah! thou art not irrevocably mine Till the inevitable hand of death Blends the forlorn divisions of our breath. 1871. VII. LOVE AT THE SEPULCHRE At times my songs of love return and shine Each as a flower of individual head, Some white, some rosy,—some blood-stained and red,— Marshalled in one long unimpeded line. And these, with many tears and thoughts, I twine To bloom about that fragrant body dead, That over her mixed petals may be shed, And spices and sweet incense I combine To make her beauty more surpassing yet;— And many months of passion, and pale days, And nights torn in unutterable ways, Are as strange flowers with rain of weeping wet,— Woodbine and spotted mint and mignonette And roses and white hyacinthine sprays. 1871. VIII. A POET'S VISION A poet lay beneath a tropic moon And heard strange noises in the misty woods, The impervious spirit-haunted solitudes, And felt across his face a silver swoon Stream as a veil of gauze,—and, sleeping soon, The inner universal life revealed Shone through him, and creation's music pealed About him, like some all-embracing tune. And through the trees came many figures flitting Under the crimson candles of the night; And voices of triumphant lovers sitting On mossy knolls, by still pools clear and bright; And he was one with birds and flowers unwitting, And through his brain there beamed a wondrous light. 1871. IX. “THE INEVITABLE HOUR” I wrote:—and since I wrote, my hour has come. The blossom of the inevitable hour When into bloom of one surpassing flower Leaps valiantly our being,—and the sum Of seasons vocable and seasons dumb And months of solitary growth of power, Through the red days of August and the sour December darkness, when the hands are numb. My hour has come and vanished:—as a flame That crowns some god-begotten hero's head For a moment,—and it flickers and is dead, And his hair seems paler now for very shame: Nor is there any token whence it came, That fire that so transfigured him and fled. 1871. X. LOVE'S STAND-POINT There is a point at which the burning soul Collects; as into one tremendous flame, Each perilous desire and every aim, Determining to sacrifice the whole. Then all God's voices and his thunders roll Like gathering tides across the shaken sand Whereon this spirit's trembling feet do stand, And the wide earth is as a parchment scroll Engraved with fiery letters: “Thou shalt die And be forgotten, even as a star That flames, and it has vanished from the sky,— Even as a comet gleaming from afar, Approaching, and then hastening to fly,— But Love is as the eternal spirits are.” 1871. XI. A DREAM OF THE MOUNTAINS A sense of sleeping in between dark firs That clothe some dreamy monstrous Apennines,— A sense of fragrance wafted from sweet pines Across the illimitable mountain-spurs,— And then, as the awaking mind demurs, The soft discovery that a woman twines Long leafy tresses,—that her splendour shines Through sleep, and that the ambrosial breath was hers. So dreamed I; and my spirit took its flight, Invulnerable, o'er the mountain-tops, On beatific pinions, softly bright As are the golden crowns of August crops;— Go where I will she follows me, nor stops Drooping for the malignance of the night. 1872. XII. A PARTING Once more! To summon up, in one wild minute, All dreams, and songs, and visions past of you, Is as a white rose with a serpent in it Erecting crest of poisonous subtle blue. 'Tis as a forest, sweet and softly tender,— But whose green depths, if stealthily explored, The cottage of some fiend to sight would render Who sways its avenues, a fetid lord. It is as if the spring contained the winter; All sweet and seemly visions, somewhat foul; Bright summer waves, a floating icy splinter; A monk, a murderer behind his cowl;— So strange a thing it is to mingle thee With this our parting's utter agony! 1872. XIII. THAT STRANGE NIGHT I. It was but in a room;—I had been sleeping; The still night deepened,—and I was alone. When on a sudden I awoke low-weeping, And through and through me rang thy silver tone. And then I saw thee, sweet one, far more clearly Than I shall ever see again in life, Not face to face, but soul to soul,—more nearly Than mother is to son, or man to wife. Then all the room was filled as with some essence Ethereal, heavenly, fragrant and divine;— God's own intoxicating gracious presence, Mixed with the intoxicating sense of thine, Pervaded every shadow of the gloom With rose-hung arches and tempestuous bloom. XIV. THAT STRANGE NIGHT II. Tempestuous! for so wild the nectar seemed, So overflowing the gold cup of joy, It was as if a damnéd murderer dreamed That once again he walked a happy boy. So vast the mighty change,—so great the weeping,— And the spirit's eaglelike gigantic bound From the pale earth whereon it had lain sleeping To crystal banks and pearl-strewn heavenly ground. So wonderful a perfume sought the ceiling, So silvery a footstep trod the floor, That all my brain and every pulse swam,—reeling As never mortal's pulses reeled before; And I was swallowed up, sweet soul, in thee, There to abide through all eternity. 1872. XV. SLOWLY Slowly my song grows,—as from day to day I add fresh flowers of ever-intenser thought; Bright buds the calm of riper age has brought, Soft violets, roses, red leaves,—many a spray Rich with the flying tints of autumn gay, Or blossoms in dense woods of summer sought:— Blue hyacinths and crocus-petals fraught With spring, and spikes of frost from winter grey. Slowly my song grows: to each word a year Of patient and of earnest thought I give, If haply, when the world's last leaf is sere, Thy songs may still be spring-sweet, lady dear,— If haply in pure music meet to live I may immortalize thy laughter clear. 1873. XVI. FIFTEEN When first I saw thee, lady of my dreams, And watched love's sunrise shed its ardent gold O'er hill and valley and wild purple wold— The golden light which once superbly gleams, Then fades for ever; when, beside the streams Of that fair Northern many-tinted sea, Thy girlish tender presence shone on me, But fifteen years had crowned thee with sunbeams. And Dante's Beatrice was but fifteen! And her sweet deathless eyes were soft sea-green, When first she stood before him in the way;— So wast thou girl-soft, simple and divine, When first thy young yet timeless glance met mine,— Green, mixed with soft sea-shadows of brown-grey. 1873. XVII. THE SWEET NIGHT The sweet night reaches thee, my lady fair! The winds caress thee, and the same stars shine Upon thee,—thy pure heavens are also mine; The same rich darkness mixes with thy hair,— We breathe the same involuntary air,— In thy soft locks the braided vapours twine,— And all their countless scents of larch and pine From each to each the darkling hill-sides bear. The sweet night reaches thee;—we are not far Apart,—the sweet night reaches thee, and falls About thee like a mantle; every star That lights the blue illimitable halls Shines upon each; our faces, truly, are Set face to face within the wide night's walls. 1873. XVIII. FLUSHED WITH VICTORY O'er every common task Love casts a glow Of pleasure, and a sacred healing calm, As o'er the garden paths the rose-trees throw Their petals, and their tender odorous balm: O'er each day's common toil Love flings a light Delicious, and a hope of fairer things,— As in the ancients' dreams a heavenly sprite Hovered above the good with golden wings. When I am quite engulfed in common toil, I faint not, lady,—but I think of thee, And fear not lest my paltry labour soil The silver-shining plumes of Poesy; For thou art ever with me, sweet, to foil Such issue, flushed with ample victory. 1873. XIX. AN ANGEL-SPIRIT Those who are true to their Ideal Love Flit down from heaven as angels with bright wings To guard their ladies' souls from sorrow's stings, Hovering with tender brilliance ever above The head they worship:—to this pleasure clings Each true soul, putting all joys else aside; Desiring no white breast of earthly bride, Nor crowns of violent fame, nor glory of kings. As angel-spirits these pervade the airs,— Some fluttering plumes that bring blue violets' breath, Some pinions rich with reddest roses' balm. For true and faithful lovers God prepares Such recompence ecstatic after death,— Fairer than saintly dreams of harp and palm. 1873. XX. SONG'S POWER AND PASSION Love, grant me life until my lady's fame Be clearly blazoned on the common air: Grant me the songful passion to declare The greatness and the bounty of her name! Then will I face the hollow clay-pit's shame, Descending into earth with bosom bare,— Happy, in that I leave behind a fair Memorial for my living love to claim. Yet am I not content with this slow fate: I brook not utter cold annihilation. Fain would I, as a live soul, take my station By some fair future city's golden gate, And, listening to my own songs, add a note, As round that far-off summer breeze they float. 1873. XXI. WHITBY Ah, Whitby, what am I to say of thee! My passionate love first ripened by thy shore: My sweet first love-flower bloomed anear the roar Of thine own lordly and tempestuous sea. Thou art an endless memory unto me Of sweet long days of early love serene,— And sweeter evenings, when the silver queen Of heaven rose o'er the cliff majestically. Thy beauty and calm I never shall forget:— Thinking of thee, my spirit is as one Who, when his life is as a setting sun, With tender diligence remembereth yet The golden passion with which life begun,— And, pondering on it, lo! his eyes are wet. 1875. XXII. A VISIT TO OXFORD A week ago I sought the self-same place Where once I wandered through the fields of spring, Seeking my vanished love with weary wing,— Searching for the lost likeness of her face. Still, still, the meadows shine with opening grace Of sweet fresh flowerets; still the glad birds sing: The spirit of Nature is an unchanged thing:— Still, still, the winds pursue their jocund race. All is the same: 'tis I am changed alone. The spirit of spring is festive in the trees; The golden buttercups are blithely blown Just as aforetime by an amorous breeze: The peace of heaven is in the azure deep.— And still the crimson clover-blossoms sleep. May 2, 1875. XXIII. ONE GIRL'S BEAUTY God gave to one to pluck the fragrant flower And wear it: on another God bestowed, Instead of that fair living bud that glowed And glittered, the imperishable power Of voice,—that, not for any paltry hour, But through the eternity of voiceful days, The beauty of that blossom he might praise And round it all the fruits of yearning shower. Which is the greatest gift and which the glory? To hold thee in a perishable embrace,— Or to hand down in deathless spotless story The beauty of the roseflower of thy face, Chanting, till even the locks of Time are hoary, One girl's unspeakable resistless grace. 1875. XXIV. SIMPLE AND SWEET Full many a pleasure through the hours of life Hath met me,—some in byeways, some in broad Wide-open pathways of the common road: Full many a flower hath fallen beneath my knife, Some gathered redly from tempestuous strife, Some plucked in valleys that calm thought hath showed;— With many gracious gleams my days have glowed; With many stars my clear skies have been rife. Yet never have I known a pleasure higher Than when, an ardent trembling youth, I came To lay before my lady my desire Couched in pure rhythmic utterance, bright with flame Of passion:—yea, the simple pleasure sweet Of laying my first verses at her feet. 1875. XXV. SWEETNESS The loves of later life are many and bold And press their cause with overweening hands; They smile upon us now from sundry lands, And some bring pleasures in a cup of gold. Passion, superb and lustrous, crowns the old Not seldom; wreathes their foreheads in bright bands Of flowers, and, smiling, waiteth their commands; Not all desires at Autumn's touch wax cold. Yet one word we reserve with holy zeal For youth alone and first love—even “sweetness:” This only young joy wins in its completeness; This only passion newly-crowned can feel; The later flowers of passion may be grand, But sweet they are not,—though they crowd the hand. 1875. XXVI. ALL THE PAST Thou dost unite the beauty of all the past In thy one perfect face.—Was Helen fair? Then are thine eyes more wonderful and rare, And tenderer looks towards my look thou dost cast. Thou hast the shades of Cleopatra's hair:— Lo! Egypt rises on my vision fast And the Nile gleams in lucid Southern air. Next, Iseult bends before the Cornish blast. I am as Antony: I mark thy wit And dream within thy strange eyes passion-lit:— Sworded as Tristram next I sweep the ways. I am as Paris: Troy before me burns;— Then, suddenly, thy supple figure turns, And lo! thou look'st at me with Helen's gaze. 1876. XXVII. THE EARLY SWEETNESS A rose was blooming as I passed along The gentle roads of youth towards early toil: A perfect flower it was, without a soil, And round it all the gracious scent was strong. To gather it thus early had been wrong,— So, well content, I hurried on my way, Devoting till the evening of the day All thoughts and passionate labour to my song. But in the evening when I thought the hour For holy gathering of the fragrant flower Approached,—rude other hands had robbed the stem: Yet though these grasp the scarlet rose mature, Her fragrance in life's morning, strangely pure, Was given to me, thank God!—not given to them. 1876. XXVIII. EARTH AND HEAVEN I. EARTH First in fair youth I sang the love of earth: The flowers of youth before me bright as fire Flickered,—I cherished many a winged desire; To eager thoughts the laughing days gave birth. Love had not known chill sorrow, nor the dearth Of strength:—he rested on a bed of flowers: Sweet joy was his, and tuneable soft hours,— Pleasure, and mutual toil, and silvery mirth. But Love was stricken. Then the earth became No more a bower of roses, but of snow,— One vast deep charnel-house, one waste of woe, Lighted at times by lurid leaping flame. Just where the rose of earth was blushing red One morn, at eve my rose-lipped love lay dead. XXIX. EARTH AND HEAVEN II. HEAVEN Then heaven I sought, and heaven-high designs:— The robes of angels glittered o'er my gaze, And at them I forgot green earthly bays, The hills of earth, the meadows and the vines, The blue waves laughing in tumultuous lines, The glittering ferns that trembled o'er the ways; Love vanished in a vast seraphic blaze Of plumes ascending,—reddening all the pines. The love of earth was changed to love of heaven: The star of hope was not the star of even But rather the pale tremulous orb of death: I looked for lily-fragrance in dim spheres Unknown; but 'mid vast hopes and vaster fears Lived undecided days,—drew dubious breath. XXX. EARTH AND HEAVEN III. HEAVEN ON EARTH Now Heaven on Earth begins. The golden corn Is bright to me as those angelic plumes Whose lustre ravishes, and then consumes: Now, many a great triumphant rose is born. Along the meadows at the crimson morn The sun flames, o'er the trembling gossamer: My life is now at peace,—and all through her By whom Love's seamless robe was rent and torn. Now she is with me: heaven is in her smile And all earth's blossomy beauty in her hands; And all the roses of the rose-red lands Upon her lips, and every birdlike wile Within her speech: an angel-woman stands Before me, snow-white,—free as flower from guile. 1876. XXXI. A PORTION OF BEATRICE Ye strange fierce seas that listen to my song, And all ye winds and mountains that rejoice In unison with my uplifted voice, And all ye streams that, one with me, are strong, And all ye countless stars, a gold-crowned throng, It is the last time, mark me, that I sing: This summer breeze that trembles at my wing, May eddy, unmolested, soon along. For I am one with Beatrice: the pure Sweet soul of her is part of me, and I No longer, stricken into speech, endure The lonely black abhorrence of the sky, But into life glad, passing speech, secure, I move: victorious now, my song may die. 1876. XXXII. TO STRANGE LANDS I bear my lady unto other lands, New spheres of thought,—through spirit-realms we fly: As one who leads from under English sky His bride to where dense tropic bloom expands, Or shapes a home for her with thoughtful hands Where through the groves Italian breezes sigh,— Or 'neath the snowy glare of mountain high,— Or 'mid the burning glare of Indian sands. Yea, so, victorious, I would bear my lady, From thought's first maiden regions, cool and shady, Towards tropic lands of fiercer burning glee: There not one friend shall follow her—for fear Of thought's wide desert, silent, parched, and drear; She shall live there alone,—alone with me. 1876. XXXIII. A WHITE FLOWER IN THE DESERT And in that desert of void endless thought, Like a white shining flower my love shall be; A flower to bloom round and encourage me, With tender petals marvellously wrought. This gift, far rarer than all gifts I sought, Shall be mine own: its utter purity Shall make that desert like some grassy sea, With lilies 'twixt the grass-blades twined and caught. This one sweet flower amid the desert sands Of hard fierce thought, a silver bloom, expands, In token that one woman did not fear, When all the other hearts of women failed, Yea, shook like reeds,—yea, bent like twigs and quailed,— To tread the desert, Love alone being near. 1876. XXXIV. THY TREASURE The dewy lips of woman are not given In any embrace of earth: so say you, friend? They tarry for the pure desires of heaven, For kisses soft and stainless, without end,— For holy thoughts of love with no base leaven Of this earth intermixed; for lovers pure As angels whose embraces shall endure:— Have maidens ever after such arms striven? So say you? To this maiden then I say: “I died, and died for ever, on the day When thou didst grant thy sweet red mouth to him:— To miss the sweet gift of thine earthly treasure Is sorrow to me passing earthly measure,— Yea, pain that fills my cup to the very rim!” 1876. XXXV. MY TREASURE The earthly glory of manhood is not small, Although the heavenly beauty may transcend And utterly surpass it at the end: It hath some blossoms, if it hath not all. As we with laughing fingers downward bend The glorious tree of youth, the great flowers fall Around us, some so flaming that they appal The vision,—such fierce petals they extend. It is no slight thing thus to grasp the glory Of fair sweet manhood,—thus to know the whole; Not waiting for the grave head crowned and hoary, But pressing quick lips 'gainst the fragrant bowl Of youth; to inhale,—and in no fairy story,— The perfume of a perfect body and soul. 1876. XXXVI. TIME AND I “Time and I.” —Cardinal Mazarin. Yea, “Time and I;” so is it with us all. Long patience, bitter suffering, sad defeat, Ere victory and our triumph high we meet,— Ere those grim towers of tribulation fall. Yet one day with a singing soft and sweet Shall gladness find us, bearing in her hands For a fair crown, the praise of many lands, And praise of lips proud conquering lips may greet. I struggle slowly on: I wreathe my flowers Of singing in a garland for the few Who listen to the labour of long hours With gentle hearts:—sharp toil I must renew, Building the fabric of a gradual name, Till “Time and I” becometh “I and Fame.” 1876. TO ALICE SIXTEEN SONNETS (1876) I. BEAUTIFUL Oh beautiful, thrice beautiful thou art! More beautiful than ever! when the days Of early love were with us, and the ways Tender with early blossoms of the heart, Thou wast not then more beautiful—the rays Of love's fair morn were round thee, but the sun Now shines upon us; great heights have we won, And cause there is for unremitting praise. The great God who has led us by the hand Through all these desolate and lonely years, Through arid furrows and grim wastes of sand, Now parts his clouds,—and all the prospect clears; Now leads us forth from out the flowerless land, Gives us green buds for thorns, and smiles for tears. II. WHITBY And now the seas round all thy cliffs are blue, O Whitby, precinct of love's early dream: Thy waters now are marvellous in hue, Silvered at night by many a magic beam Just as of old, when all the wondrous view Widened beneath the moon's unearthly gleam; All old strange fancies of delight come true Now,—now more summerlike the zephyrs seem, And all the reddened luscious rosebuds teem With fragrance, now that, fragrant rosebud, you Descend on earth to soften and redeem,— To heal and to deliver and renew,— To make all glad things gladder, and the dew Clearer, and more intense the ocean-stream. III. BENEATH OTHER STARS But now beneath strange stars our spirits meet. Those golden flowerbuds of the gracious sky, That shone upon our youth, when you and I Found their gold petals, falling on us, sweet— Those ancient stars are withered with life's heat,— The golden petals, once so smooth, are dry; Oh, darling, heave with me one long sweet sigh For tracks deep-trodden by lone flowerless feet. The sorrow and loneliness are over truly,— Life's fresh stars rise and beam upon us newly,— Yet weep for splendours of the ancient day: Forget not wholly the most sacred night Of young love's uttermost and mute delight; Forget not any flower dropped by the way. IV. SPLENDOUR The supreme splendour of surpassing love Is all before us,—flowers before us gleam Sweeter than any flowers of sweetest dream, And towards new heavenly blossoms our feet move. August is all the happiness before us, And yet because it is august and great I would forget no star that once shone o'er us, But all life's pleasures recapitulate. The humblest flower e'er trodden by thy feet To me is holiness,—to me is sweet; Thine every pleasure I would make my own, Each smile, each laugh, each cadence of thy tone; Thy life I would absorb,—I envy even Thy nightly robe of dark encircling heaven. V. THE FLOWERS The flowers that thou hast loved within my song Shine tenderly,—they are thy sweetest friends, And to all such my including strain extends Its grace: they shine within it in a throng! Smooth jonquil, white camellia, rosebud gay: Violets from nooks round which the water bends; Green grasses, lavish ferns, all gifts love sends; Thine orange-blossoms,—smiling, all obey. Not one frail bud will I forget, I swear! Whether within white bosom or deep hair That bud has lingered, softly gathering sweets; Thy life I wreathe around thee for a crown,— Thine own past blossom-pleasures I lay down,— I watch thy heart that was, and count its beats. VI. “NOW THOU ART WITH ME” Now thou art with me, angel of each day, Each day is as an angel golden-plumed; The old desires that tortured and consumed Have gathered rapid wings, and sped away. The old fierce yearning is a thing entombed For ever 'neath the old skies cold and grey; Upon life's grass-plots many a flower has bloomed; The larks in blue skies murmur music gay. O woman, woman, who canst give a crown Sweeter than roses, richer than renown, How long thou lingerest ere thine hands bestow,— Yet when thou dost give, how divine a glow Of heavenly rapture lights thy face!—how calm The boon of flowers soft-pressed within thy palm! VII. THE CLOSING OF MY SONG The closing of my strain of many years Brings solemn thoughts: sweet death with tender wings Now round me, gentle as a woman, sings, And all his chant awakes the swelling tears. The fight is nearly ended I have fought; The crown is nearly woven I have won; Almost complete the work at which I've wrought; The never-ceasing toil seems well-nigh done. Solemn it is to put my strong sword down, Ungird my armour and to lay my shield At length upon the red deep-trodden field,— Most solemn to assume the conqueror's crown: When sin, time, death—the final foes—shall yield Then am I victor—till then, Fly, renown! VIII. REST Yet rest and flowers, for swords and pain, are sweet Sweet too the whispering of the summer wind Outside the casement, softly through the blind Pulsing:—advancing, playing at swift retreat! Glad too it is the old soft glance to meet, No longer doubtful, but for ever kind; Glad all maturer raptures of the mind; Pleasant the simple warmth, the strong June heat. Oh, after the long fighting and the labour, Pleasant it is to quit the ensanguined sword; Joyous to cast aside the crimsoned sabre, Unwinding from the wrist its blood-glued cord: Merry to list to moonlight harp and tabour, And all glad sounds through leafy vistas poured. IX. OUR LOVE-FLOWERS Back men shall look, considering all my song: As we now look towards Helen, or the face Of that eternal Beatrice whose grace Crowned the Italian bard, and made him strong. Back men shall glance, throughout the ages long; And women's hearts shall struggle hard to trace Those perfect woman's features that I place Herein for ever,—safe from time and wrong. Our early love-flowers are eternal things, Though on the earth so soon they passed away With tremulous sighing in their snowy wings, And signs of death-tints, tokens of decay; Time withers,—time sure retribution brings,— Not one lost bud but blooms within my lay. X. BEYOND “Not in that way!” but in the holier sense Of all high, sacred, and eternal things. Such love, such passion, thy fair spirit brings; It granteth every pleasure most intense, And every crown,—but not the crowns of kings. It reigneth with me underneath the stars: Its lovely grace no selfish yearning mars: It spreadeth in the sunbeams snow-white wings. Beyond all love of purest earth is ours; Beyond the yearning of the rose-red flowers; Beyond desires of days and hopes that fall: Beyond time's victories—yea, beyond them all! Beyond the future: yea, beyond the tomb Begins our passionate love-flower's fullest bloom. XI. THE WOMAN In early days the woman was my queen; The fair sweet maiden, crowned with first love's flowers. With her I wandered through the inwoven bowers Of first love,—marked the young moon's silver sheen Upon the deep, or heard the echoing shore Ring to the white waves, answering their roar: With her I lingered through the summer hours Or smote the river tides with laughing oar. I sought no further than the simple boon Of simple maiden love: sufficient bliss Had been the bounty of her red-lipped kiss; One whispered word beneath the secret moon. The maiden all-sufficing was: all fair: The summer beauty slept amid her hair. XII. THE ANGEL I lost her, and the passionate angel came With heavenly glitter in her glowing wings, And words of comfort, and a crown like flame: Such change, such gradual recompence time brings, Touching, transforming many an early aim. Through heaven we passed together, and we saw With sighs of rapture and with trembling awe Love's perfect goal: we conquered love and fame. In heaven we dwelt together for long years And plucked white wondrous blossoms for a token, To bear away if e'er the dream was broken, And earth with all her retinue of fears Returned: seraphic words were round us spoken, And we forgot all terror and all tears. XIII. THE ANGEL-WOMAN But now the angel and the woman too Are mine: the white arms and the golden wings Are but as one—as joined undiverse things, And the sweet eyes, of the old tender hue, Now shine upon me: dreams have all come true,— Life's calm is reached as round the planet swings: Once more to mine the woman's bosom clings And yet we are wrapped in heaven's most fragrant dew. O wondrous woman-angel and yet heart Of mine own living spirit,—we can part Never again now thus thy bosom white, Fragrant as roses, yet with heavenly light Shineth for me: thou art for ever now A woman, for the angel crowns thy brow. XIV. BACK TO THEE And now I leave these thoughts—e'en Nature too I leave, for thou art Nature, and her whole Delight in thine immeasurable soul Blossoms: thou art to me the pearly dew Of morn, and whiter than the rose in hue,— Thou hast the notes of birds upon thy tongue: Through thee the immortal cadences have rung: Thou art the darkling eve; the midday blue. I leave all things for thee—the summer air; For thou art sweeter, and thy mouth more fair. I quit the sacred rapture of the night; Thine hair is deeper, and than stars more bright Thine eyes: thou keepest all created things Safe with the safe shield of thy snowy wings. XV. I CALL THEE I call thee! o'er the distance sounds my voice. Art thou asleep? then hearken through a dream: Or art thou waking? then let music seem To reach and stir thee; in its power rejoice. Where'er thou art I send for thee:—a gleam Of sudden sunshine is upon the waves Of my strong singing, and it crowns the graves Of buried hopes with one triumphant beam. The past has vanished: with me face the years That shall be to thee one triumphant crown; Wipe the last lingering trace of lonely tears; The wreath that I have won thee I lay down. I call thee! Listen—let thy happy eyes Flash with the radiance of the new-born skies. Christmas Day, 1876. XVI. SOFT EYES Soft eyes of women many have I seen,— But none so soft, so wonderful, so fair: Locks have I kissed of golden and brown hair, Lips have I kissed of many a rose-sweet queen, But never any locks or lips, I ween, Can with thy sacred tresses, or the rare And perfect mouth that quivered once, compare: The same eyes glance,—but now with tenderer sheen. Gazing in awe, I see my song therein, And all its sorrows, all its joy as well Reflected: in the face I sought to win, For which I climbed to heaven, and traversed hell, I see the recompence for what hath been, More sweet, more pure, more grand, than tongue can tell. Christmas Day, 1876. TIME'S WHISPERINGS (1879–1880) YOUTH'S MEADOWS Youth's meadows all were bountiful with gold; The sweet seas all were laughing in their glee, Responsive on the beach the breakers rolled. Assiduous sang the birds in every tree Chanting the wedding, love, of you and me; For through the realms of nature was it told, Yea, signalized through earth eternally And through the azure heavens wide and free, And o'er the yellow furze-crowned breezy wold Where hand in hand we wandered, love, of old, Brushing the heather-sprays that reached the knee Luxuriant. The clouds parted, fold on fold, To let our marriage-pinions glisten through The utmost resonant heights of arduous blue. THE UTMOST RESONANT HEIGHTS Yea, all the resonant heights of ether parted, We joined the angels in their glittering throng, Not two, but one—one-souled, one-lipped, one-hearted, We passed their gleaming myriad bands among; And through our souls the heavenly music rung, And through our ears the heavenly message sped Tender, and round about our hearts it clung; The gentle whisper of the gentle dead: It was as if a nightingale had sung, It was as if some golden word was said; The stars our hastening onward footsteps led— Then up the sudden white moon-glory sprung, And in those heavenly halls we slept and dreamed, While white upon me thy moon-whiteness gleamed. THY WHITENESS Oh, thou wast white! Beyond all earthly splendour Of utmost love thine utter whiteness shone: Moon-radiant, subtle, sweet, supremely tender, Luring with gentle might my passion on. No singing words can all thy beauty render; It gleamed one perfect moment—then 'twas gone! A lily waved on earth her flower-stalk slender And seemed to smile up at me, soft and wan! But thou hadst vanished, sweet, and never more Shall I set foot on that far heavenly shore; Or see thy whiteness glittering through my sleep. The lily yet I have—but not thy form, As for one awful moment, white and warm, It mingled into mine in rapture deep. TWO SPIRITS SONG Two spirits, mixing, blending, Went swiftly upward tending To the skies: Their golden course no power Could stay—sweet hour on hour They uprise. In heaven's holy night These spirits, glad and bright, Became One perfect spirit-being, Far, far beyond death seeing, Earth's pale dominions fleeing Like a flame. But back in the sad morn To earthland they were borne On slow faint wings— Slowly, slowly weeping; But still the chant that sleeping, They heard, around them rings. ARE WE FORGOTTEN? Are we forgotten, when our spirits pass The silent doors of all-absorbing death? Yea, do we mingle with the flowers and grass, And draw no more sweet loving human breath? Lovers have trodden love's mystic path before us, And other fair-souled lovers will succeed— Will mark the same blue skies that once shone o'er us, Or haply with the same deep sorrows bleed. Oh, is there any resting place, a haven For love's wings sent forth like the pilot raven To pierce the shadows, pioneer the tomb? Hath patient endless labour any worth, Abiding value, surety, upon earth, Or doth all loving effort end in gloom? MY SONG Yea, what shall be the ending of my song? Oh, listening lady, what wilt thou bestow Upon thy minstrel pale and worn, but strong, With thoughts that burn, and eager lips that glow— What fair reward shall I, thy singer, know, Now that long years have listened to my voice And heard thy praises through my numbers flow? Dost thou not gladden, dost not thou rejoice? Must death, with bosom colder than the snow, Wait and be sole obedient bride to me, And wilt thou ever turn aside and flee, As through our separate lives, with footstep slow We pace, uncertain what rewards may wait Beyond death's bitter unresponsive gate? SUMMERS HAVE PASSED Summers have passed—yea, many a glowing morn, And many a moonlit wonderful soft night Since thou wast from my eager longing torn; Yea, since that day full many a rosebud bright Hath bloomed amid the fields of our delight, And the great golden stars have glimmered down On many passions as they reached their height. How many loves have granted love's sweet crown, While love's old petals withered yet and brown Remain for me—no hand but thine can give Bloom to the leaves that darken 'neath thy frown, Bloom, and the splendid power to bud and live With laughing new-born lustre, and divine Perfume more sweet than rain-kissed eglantine. THE SAME For thou art ever, love, the very same: Yea, far beyond the dismal fields of death The broad blown plains of flowers have felt thy breath And rippled into sheets of blossomy flame. Death's hand faints back from thee for very shame: Thou art too fair a flower for him to touch; Filled with God's gift of beauty overmuch For death to injure, or despair to claim. Pass death, pass heaven, and search the utmost deep Where farthest dreams with folded pinions sleep, Yea, seek throughout God's uttermost domain, Yet shalt thou find there no such love as ours, No wreath like this of death-despising flowers, No singing land like that whereo'er we reign. THY KISS When thou didst kiss me in the heavenly dream One was I made with every poet fair: I felt all past pure raptures through me stream. Bathed were my temples in Italian air, And thou wast Beatrice, and I could wear Unshrinking on my temples that high crown Her lover sole of all men then could bear; Thy kiss gave strength and pleasure and renown. But most of all it gave thine utter soul And all its glory to me—yea the whole, Pouring supreme delight transcending speech Throughout me, rapture that no words can reach; For who can say, sweet love, how sweet thou art, Or tell the secrets of a rose's heart? STRANGE How passing strange to think, when we are dead The cruel heedless flowers will bloom the same— White roses, yellow roses, roses red— Amid the meads through which we silent came, When passion burned throughout us like a flame; The ferns, the grass, the creamy meadow-sweet, Will cluster, knowing not reproach or shame, Around the passage of new lovers' feet, And the rich sun will gladden these with heat, Not recking how beneath their tread we lie;— Their faces just as glad a morn will meet As we met, equal azure in the sky: And yet with us the dream no more abides— Crowning fresh lovers, garlanding new brides. ONCE Once through a sacred mist of golden sleep Your spirit like a pure sweet angel came, And wrapped me in an ecstasy so deep, That gone was every sorrow, every shame, Swept far for ever by thine onset's flame; But now the long days widen out before me, And perhaps no summer bearing one white rose Will ever bend with fragrant plumage o'er me, But alway shall I dwell 'mid rains and snows. A decade of my life will ere long close: Ten years and more have passed since I beheld Thy sweet face—still its beauty round me glows, And still the fire of passion, vast, unquelled, Urges me on towards lands no mortal knows. THE COMING DECADE What shall the coming stormy decade bring? Yea, even the long months of the coming year? What flowers for me shall shine in fields of spring, Or gladden golden August or the clear June days?—doth any triumph hasten near?— Or is my victory pressed between Death's hands, And will Death's footstep only bring it here? Oh, whispers reach me from far unseen lands, Wherein full many a poet-victor stands Crowned, glad, divine, triumphant—yea, the singing Of many voices lifts me; there expands Blue sky before my gaze, a message bringing That bids me wait in peace the final morn When I shall pass beyond earth's spears, earth's scorn. I AM NOT CAREFUL I am not careful whether I retain The suffrage and the praise the crowd bestow: My eyes are set beyond earth's valley and plain, On meads of pure delight they cannot know. Art is my mistress, and her hands of snow Shall crown me; if I aught deserve of crowning: Shall lift me far above these regions low. Oh, never may the present judge me, drowning The judgments that from lips of poets flow! My song is written for lovers, and for skies And seas and stars and glad suns as they rise; To cheer the feet that through the future go. Oh, heedless am I of the present time— I look from its mere vales towards mounts sublime. THE SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS Yea, towards God's snow-capped mountains do I raise Mine eyes and towards God's temples lift my voice: The endless beauty of my love I praise, That she too in my singing may rejoice, Finding immortal pleasure in my lays. Oh, beautiful her face beneath the bays Smiles, when I lift the circlet from mine head; Forgetting for a season all the ways Of song—the paths of suffering fiery-red Through which my thorn-pierced footsteps have been led, And all the lonely nights and grievous days— When I forgetting these gaze up instead And watch the amorous tender leaves grow green Touching the unfurrowed forehead of my queen. GREEN AND WHITE SONG How soft the gentle bay-leaves shine Upon thy forehead white: Fairer than rose or eglantine, Or wreaths the woodland fairies twine, Or pliant tendrils of the vine— A sweeter nobler sight. And if some leaves are splashed with blood, Oh take it not amiss! 'Mid serried warriors I have stood And borne the brunt of battle-flood, Stemmed many a storm of sorrow rude, Since last I felt thy kiss! THOU CANST NOT ESCAPE Oh, thou canst not escape! my songs pervade The distance lying between us, and they fill The sunny plain, the fields, the leafy shade. They ripple to thee in the rippling rill, They call unto thee from the gleaming hill; They laughing claim thee as mine own for ever In spite of all that time can work of ill. They cluster round thee, to forsake thee never; Their plumes in the hazy air of August quiver; They follow thee throughout the silent deep Unfathomed dim abodes of awful sleep, O'er tides of resonant sea and tides of river: Yea, one day they shall hold thee in strong hands, And bear thee forth a captive towards strange lands. TEN YEARS Ten years—ten years! What is it but a dream? A long strange dream of blossoms and of frost, Blue skies and thunder, summer and a gleam Of heaven and love at times, as quickly lost As found—swift backward on black pain-waves tossed. Oh, what are ten years but one mortal spray Of meadow-sweet flung white against the tomb That gathers all sweet petals, pure perfume, Into its hollow arms from day to day, Laughing as with cold teeth pale bloom from bloom It severs, and the thin films faint away Into death's desolate nefarious gloom, Joining the prisoners sweet in long array Whom year by year he gathers—to consume. YET IN TEN YEARS Yet in ten years a high work may be done, Labour accomplished that shall put to shame The swift departure of the vanquished sun, When the red waves receive on crests of flame The lingering arrows its last efforts aim. For in ten years the meadow-sweet immortal Of song may crown and robe one much-loved name; Yea, and the wings of song may through death's portal Bear, living and triumphant, one flower-form, Still beautiful and white, still breathing, warm. In ten years, sweetheart, I have set thee high In many hearts, so that thou shalt not die; And lifted thee above the flickering breeze Of earth, and spurned for thee death's vengeful seas. A FLOWER UNTO MANY Thou dost not know the numberless sweet hearts To whom the gentle knowledge of thee came Through the soft messages my song imparts: Thou dost not know how many gold-tipped darts, Winged, beautiful, abundant, bright with flame, My soul, on fire with loving thee, doth aim Against the steel-bound cuirass of the world, That so it might be pierced with utter shame, In that it has not known and loved of old The name that I from height to height have hurled. There is not any flower, with heart of gold, But hath in darkness of the summer night Whispered the name I've whispered, with delight,— And 'mid high spirits' converse is it told. THINE ENGLISH EYES Thine English eyes are sweeter than the day, More beautiful than light at early morn, Tenderer than stars, or than the tender grey Of even when the moon's slow car is borne Upward by grey far propping waves forlorn: Not Beatrice, in Italy the queenly, Flashed love, or mirth, or summer-lightning scorn, So sweetly, or so roselike and serenely. The English breezes crowned thy young fair head, And kissed thy lips, and made them roses red: The English meadow-sweet purloined thy breath, Blossomed immortal then, and laughed at death: An English poet loves thee, and his hand Crowns thee queen over queens in lyric land. IF, AFTER DEATH If, after death, my singing may be heard Within the land of Shelley and of Keats— The land that shook at vast-souled Milton's word, The land that every morn its Shakespeare greets Smiling and proud—if this my land repeats My lady's name, my song, when I am dead Crowned am I then for ever—yea, the red Sunset of death as life eternal falls Beaming around me, summons in its walls My spirit glad beyond all mortal measure Then at the great sweet death-voice as it calls; Yea, if one song my land shall love and treasure, Then am I deathless in the high domain Whereover the dead deathless singers reign. THROUGH THE FAR-OFF GATES Oh, wilt thou meet one day within the halls Of heaven the golden-haired supreme delight, Whose voice through Spenser's song to the ages calls? Wilt thou, my lady of the sea-glance bright, Take 'mid those heavenly bowers thy place by right, Borne on the wide waves of my fearless singing Through time's vain-struggling armies clothed in night? To-day thy soft arms unto me are clinging, And in mine ears thy silver laugh is ringing, Lifted I am in spirit beyond all measure; Lo! through the far-off gold gates I am bringing A new-born heaven-august impassioned treasure; I set my love, my lady of song, my bride, In heaven, at Dante's Beatrice's side. THE MEADOW-SWEET SOUL SONG Thou art the meadow-sweet, love, That bloomed anigh the rill That flowed with ripples fleet, love, Through the green cloven hill; But fairer than the flower, And fragrant not one hour Alone, but through the ages vast and chill. Thou art the white white rose, love, That blooms in summer's nest: Just as its beauty glows, love, So gleams thy rose-white breast; But sweeter than the rose, And whiter than all snows, A flower than flowers more fair, than dreams more blest. Thy soul is meadow-sweet, love, Thine eyes are starry rays; The grasses kiss thy feet, love, The honeysuckle sprays A honeysuckle sister Losing, have sobbed and missed her, Till on thy lips they've kissed her, There found more fragrant after many days. HIGH THOUGHTS High thoughts and soaring impulse hath the age, Our age, our age of passion and of song: Fierce warfare with untruth its warriors wage, Pitiless battle with each hoary wrong That sits miscrowned, with impious sceptre strong. A rose thou art, and I the rose's singer, Yet will I with a spear-shaft supple and long Amid the tilters at the tourney linger, Then sweep again my harp with boisterous finger, Strengthened by battle 'mid the echoing lists— Of battle's red bloom I will be the bringer, Yea, let my helm flame through the century's mists, The helm of one who, unlike patient Keats, Loved best where most the storm of battle beats. LEAVING THE BOWER OF LOVE Leaving the bower of love, I seek the scene Where thought's mailed servants in their stout array Drive with straight swords the opposing clouds between: Oh, at the dawning of a stormy day That breaks tempestuous over wastes of grey We are living—yet within high thought's domain Are there not many gracious words to say? What if the singer's robe with sanguine stain Be wet, voice hoarsened from the battle-rain, Shall he not find more rest and sweeter after When to his heart thy white form he doth strain, Thou image of white soft peace, and hears thy laughter Ringing high up towards many a gold hall-rafter In love's delicious, bloodless, spotless fane? REVOLUTION When blood-red Revolution in the air Waveth her banner—when thought's streams flow deep Waking, loud-resonant, from their summer sleep— When all the age one wide unrest doth share— When the Republic's lions from their lair Emerge, and with their roar make cowards creep,— When vast ideas like cataracts overleap The common bounds, and down the hill-sides tear: Then is love sweet? Yea, sweeter than of old, When love's each whisper turned life's tides to gold! Yea, after battle softer is the rose Beside the wayside as the victor goes, Stiff, wearied, bleeding, wounded, towards his home, His lips yet crusted with red battle-foam. FLOWERS OF THOUGHT Pale flowers of thought upon thy forehead white, Mixed with love's lustrous blossoms, I would set: Not only passion's rich bloom, and the light Of lilies of soft dreams, and mignonette, And ferns with the earliest purest dewdrops wet; Not only these, but flowers of highest labour Won where the swiftest-wingéd tempests fret The rocky hills, and smite with countless sabre The snow-fields and blue pinnacles of the ice— Where thunder hath the lonely moon for neighbour And not one faintest beat of valley-tabour Throbs up on dim mist-pinions as they rise— Wonderful gentians from thought's furthest mountains My soul would bring, and drops from star-kissed fountains. MY ROSE OF THE VALLEY Wilt thou, my Rose o' the valley, my divine Sweet tender soft-lipped quiet valley-rose, Around thy brows for wreaths the high mists twine, And with me pierce the fathomless far snows, Testing a land no previous lover knows? Yea, shall we leave the trodden lower valleys And towards the land the rising sun-flame shows Turn sure swift steps, and thread its icy alleys, And brave the passes whence the north wind sallies With pure delicious cold untrammelled breath, Where with the mountain-peaks his brides he dallies, Whose kissing lips to mortal brides are death. Yea, shall I kiss thee with the north wind's mouth, Rather than amorous dull lips of the south? THE UTMOST HEIGHTS Art thou so strong, O lady of the vale, That thou canst dare the utmost heights with me And the utmost blue-grey mountain-peaks assail, Thy foot not trembling, nor thine heart nor knee, Thy spirit longing not to turn nor flee? Oh, wilt thou through the iron passes follow Making their rocky upright sheer sides ring, Not fearing lest their awful black gulfs swallow The gentle laugh that like a flower doth cling To their precipitous steeps, and the sweet thing Be no more heard amid the endless hollow Grim laughless palace of the pale ice-king— Canst thou, O rose of valley-passion, dare With me to tempt this rose-embittering air? THE SOUTH-WEST WIND Yea, for thou art the fragrant south-west wind, Its gentle whisper in the summer trees, Its gentle rustle of the sultry blind Of summer—what doest thou on mounts that freeze, Yea, what hast thou, my sweet, to do with these High rocks that scorn and choke thy summer laughter? If thou dost venture from thy green calm leas Then of a surety thy step Death stalks after, And soon will tremulous shudders shake thy knees And dissolution thy white body seize: O south-west wind of mine be wise, nor follow Thy singer upward when the white mists swallow His fast-receding form—not all Apollo Hath shod with sandals stormier than the breeze. WEDDED WINDS Pour thou thy breath along the rose-hung lanes, Sweet west wind—pass through fragrant Italy— Yea, linger over many a perfumed sea Whose waves the deathless southern sunset stains. But as for me where the high north wind reigns I'll reign, and with keen tides of purest breath Sweep over ice-bound lands and frozen plains Where all is silent in consummate death:— But join thou unto mine thy fragrant hand, And I will with thee seek thy southern land,— Yea, thou shalt melt and bless my iron-bound north, And I with thee through flowers will sally forth, Brace, not destroy, thy southern sweetest rose, While thou shalt shrink not from, but melt, my snows. TOGETHER SONG Through the wild world together, Through summer scented weather Like winds, we'll sally forth— And I will be the breeze At whose touch glaciers freeze In the strange lands of the north: But thou shalt be the west wind, The gentle rose-caressed wind, The balmy-breathed and blest wind That gladdens green soft leas. Oh, we will wait for lovers Within the hazel covers, And whisper in their ears; And thou shalt teach the roses Each summer month discloses Young flowerlike hopes and fears; And I will gently carry The wings of birds, and marry The sighing flowers, and tarry To soothe a snowdrop's tears! Oh wilt thou then, dear west wind, Within thy white soft breast, wind, Gather the wings of me: That in the end my lonely Pain be faint memory only, Like cloud upon the sea That fadeth at the breaking Of morning—so mine aching, Sweet west wind, from me taking, Mingle mine heart with thee. THE FLOWERS OF ANCIENT WORLDS I. The flowers of ancient worlds whereof we see No traces, have not died nor wholly past: They flung their perfume on the wide free blast While living—then they fled from vale and lea And their sweet tender fragrant spirits were cast Into the tender women-souls whom we Behold and worship; not one long-lost rose But in the sweet mouth of some woman blows: Not one dear blossom in some far land hilly But now shines forth white-handed—yet a lily. They are not changed—save only that they bloom Sweeter, and with a lovelier soft calm, And all the world, for one small vale, perfume; One woman hath rose-lips, a lily-palm Another—and the crocus-crown of gold Shines forth in bright locks, splendid as of old. II. Then what wast thou? In what far land didst thou Blossom? What region, splendid from thy breath, Triumphed thenceforward over night and death? Waht lily was the white calm of thy brow? Art thou a lily, or a grand rose now, Or some unearthly flower too sweet to name? Yea, from what strange dim shadowy woodland came Thy spirit? Thou art flower-sweet. Whence, or how? Who saw thee blossoming in the lonely vale With thine own soft surpassing sweetness pale? Who watched thee, sweetheart, centuries ago? Was I the wind who kissed thee, or the stream Within whose ripples did thy petals dream,— Or leaves which over thee cool shade did throw? III. Yea, who could tell thou wast a woman then? Not thine own sister-flowers of sister-sweetness But not the same divine white flower-completeness, For moulded thou wast to be loved of men, Yea, to be followed with all passionate fleetness. Was it God who watched, and marked thy holy meetness To spring forth budlike, tenderly expanding, Into a woman's shape, superb, commanding, Bearing the old same fragrance in her limbs, The flowerlike scent whereat the dazed sense swims,— Yea, suddenly, is the shapely flower-stem standing Human, alive for aye, with breath that dims All watching eyes—so sweet it is—with tears, And voice like flowing ripples in all ears? IV. For, sweet, there is not any woman like thee! They are not flowers, these common shapes around, Nor sprang they sudden from enchanted ground. Oh, how the old playful breeze, as if to strike thee, Charged, then withdrew with gentle rustling sound When thou within green Paradise wast bound, Not dreaming of thy coming days of earth, Or of these clinging songs, so firmly wound About thy temples—knowing not of thy birth That was to be, nor of thy woman-worth— Dreaming instead that thou wast but a flower Whose gentle wings for ever should abide Within that far sequestered silent bower, Never becoming mortal's blossom-bride. V. Now, therefore, all my triumph is the greater In that for me this splendid bud hath bent: The greater, grander triumph cometh later, With more within it of divine content. What though the former blue clear heavens were rent With thunder, and the forked lightning flew Like angry wings of vengeful angels sent Sudden adown the piteous shuddering blue? What though the old glad skies of peaceful hue Be gone for ever—yet, in front sublime Delight waits, nobler than delights we knew In early struggling days of love and rhyme. For him who tarries, him who patient waits, Bound open at the last heaven's inmost gates! VI. And then the old strange sleep that brought thy splendour, O gracious woman-blossom-heart, so near, Again shall brood with wings snow-soft and tender About me, and thy whisper in my ear Shall bid all dark clouds from my spirit clear; Again the old unutterable wonder On angel-pinions through the cloven sheer Abysses nourishing the latent thunder, Soft, shall descend. I shall say, “Thou art here:” And all the immense heaped clouds shall part in sunder, All dark wet mists that made earth's valleys drear, And the great heavenly peaks shall flash out yonder. Again through vistas of enchanted sleep I shall be borne, gliding from deep to deep. VII. For have I not through troublous seasons waited, Soothing my lonely spirit with my song, A warrior worn with fight, a bard belated, Weary with woes, a tempest-wingéd throng, And endless adverse foam-crowned surges strong? Have I not wandered through the forests dreary, Seeking the bud that to me did belong— The blossom that I loved within the eerie Old forest-walls before life, wingless, weary, Fell like a robe upon us, and we knew The stifling vales of earth for the vast airy High meads, we sped on spotless pinions through Ages before, at fateful birth, we died, Life severing me from my celestial bride. VIII. This is the mystery, and this the glory That no man apprehends his wedded queen, Nor knows her past, nor understands her story. Oh, all strange blossoms over poets lean, And poets' ears with multitudinous voices Are filled—their eyes are dazzled with the sheen Of viewless wings—their trembling soul rejoices At heavenly raiment, half-revealed, half-seen. O mystic lady of the viewless wood, Now that on actual earth thy feet have stood, Art thou not frightened—wilt thou flee away, Nor let me guide, as gentle as a ray Of sunlight or of moonlight, o'er the foam Of life thy steps towards our ancestral home? IX. For long enough on earth I've waited sighing, Cold, lonely, weary—nursing my sad heart In silence and in misery, apart, Fainting for lack of thee—enduring, dying. Now unto me come, winged at length and flying: Tarry no more, now these songs smite thine ear. O love, thy new-found subtle pinions trying, Seek me, and with the old voice silver-clear Say unto me, “Lost sweetheart, I am here! Thou hast done enough—now let us rest and sleep, Forgetting all the past, its every fear, Its every horror—plunging in the deep Of God's eternal passion-breakered sea That waits to swallow and mingle you and me.” THOU WAST A BLOSSOM SONG Thou wast a blossom by the deep Still rivers that in heaven sleep; Thou wast a white bud then: Thou camest forth to fling thine arms And all thy flower-sweet countless charms Around the hearts of men. Who loveth thee, he loves indeed For many a year without love's meed, For who can win a flower? But when the sweet day comes, he takes A bride more pure than bloom that shakes Upon the bride's own bower. As soft as blossoms in the breeze, Her soft white unclothed form he sees, Her fragrant inmost soul; And while he folds about her wings Triumphant, all his spirit sings, Touching love's kingliest goal. ALL DREAMS [All dreams of splendid music and of love] All dreams of splendid music and of love Shall be summed up, sweet gracious lady, in thee: All hopes of youth, all visions from above, All power of song, all strength of purity, All wonder of soft moonlight on the sea And majesty of noontide, and the calm And bounty of unutterable night; The ripple of the slow tide's evening psalm, And the great glory of the wakening light; The countless golden crowns whose starry might Pervades the utmost heavens, and the pure winds That churn the seething waters into white;— All these wide realms of Nature thou dost sway; The waters woo thee, and the storms obey. II. Thou bring'st me thus the strange unspoken power Of all the universe. I hear its song From star and stormy blast, from sun and flower, From ripples of the lake, and from the strong And white-lipped breakers, as one gleaming throng They pour their serried might upon the beach; Yet loving these, I do mine own no wrong, For far past Nature unto her I reach, Hearing the sweet streams in her silver speech, And marking in her bosom the white bloom Of every perfect rosebud—yea of each The intense enthralling mystical perfume: She owneth Nature, and her breath pervades The avenues of lime and hawthorn glades. III. Thee knowing thus, I pass beyond the gaze Of Nature and of all the world around, And tread with thee the unseen heavenly ways, And hear the unseen heavenly harp-strings sound No more by earthly chains impeded, bound. Thou art the power behind the natural veil Of things—upon the night thy locks unwound Stream forth, and I pursue thy figure pale As slow from star to star thy pinions sail Along the impurpled dark, and I can dream So sweetly of thee that my dreams avail To bring thee towards me, and thy kisses seem To rest upon my lips this very night, Warm and impassioned, dew-soft, violet-light. IV. Yea, after all these lingering lonely years, These years while thou hast waited far away, How great a thing, how sweet a thing appears, That this sweet night with me thy soul doth stay, And thou art tender, nor dost answer “Nay” To the immemorial and untold desire Denied through many a night and many a day;— Now with redoubled passionate fierce fire I wait thee, flinging from mine awestruck lyre At length the glad sounds of a marriage hymn; No more the words are tearful and aspire, Now rather as a robe thine every limb, Thine hair, thy lips, thy soul, thy perfect face, They wrap themselves round swiftly, and embrace. V. This night thou tarriest with me; not on wings Evasive shalt thou this night cleave the gloom! Rest here, a gold-winged angel in my room, And white-winged woman-spirit whom time brings Ready at last to him who waits and sings. Lo! thou art risen at last, love, from thy tomb, Beautiful, glad, a flower in perfect bloom, And in mine ear thy wedded whisper rings. “Lo! I am coming—let the feast be ready, The wedding furnished, and love's gold flame steady I' the air—lo! now at last, in no sweet dream, In mine own robe of snowy woman-whiteness I meet unshrinking, love, the fierce dear brightness That from thy loving conquering eyes doth stream. VI. “Yea, now I come, love, to be thine for ever: No more to part, but through the wondrous night To touch thee with my lips, too fond to sever, Once having touched, and with my sacred white Glory of womanhood thy pure delight To be—see how the stars in sacred gladness Share now our joy with countless glances bright! Cast off thy past immeasurable sadness! And reach thine hand forth and take tender hold Of mine hand, husband—husband from of old; And lead me into regions never seen Of mortals, where we rule as king and queen: Cling to me—burn throughout me with thy face, And strong keen lips on mine no less keen place!” VII. So said she, and the far glad ether trembled, And swift along the hills ran crimson light: The waves laughed out for gladness nor dissembled; In the deep utmost valleys it was bright. But over us was sacred star-sown night As yet—that holy veil of love we enter, And like a floating moon her body white Seems of that mystic universe the centre. Now is my song completed, for no more Pale words pursuing ripple on the shore Of thought, but only words of worship throng The final vestibules of sinking song, And only thoughts of utter gladness fill The spirit whose wild throbs will soon be still. VIII. Still, for the heart of woman giveth peace, Peace in the end, and blessing, not sharp woe. The days of passionate fierce seeking cease, Wherein our pierced feet wandered to and fro, Seeking her beauty whom at length we know Eternally our own; the trodden places Now far behind us redden at the glow Of morning, as the red sun's chariot races Along the arch of sky, and hot-wheeled chases The white-wheeled timorous chariot of the moon: Now watch we, smiling, in each other's faces A light that shall be deathless glory soon When, spirits eternal, we become a part Of God's own deathless passionate sweet heart. GOLD-WINGED SPIRITS SONG Two gold-winged spirits went Towards heaven well content: In fiery dream To blend they seem, And the veil of heaven was rent. Then through and through The gleaming blue These wedded spirits passed, Till they reached God's throne at last, And God's own rapture knew. Rapture supreme, unending, For ever downward sending Love-glory like a gleam; And the crown upon the man Was a wreath so sweet, so wan, Of the old flower of love's dream, The meadow-sweet she gave On earth's side of the grave: And the crown upon the bride Was the pain-wreath scarlet-dyed Of the lover by her side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. III CHARLES KINGSLEY I O strong pure spirit to whom The leaves, the hills, the bright and bounding seas, The laughing whisper of the English breeze, Fair summer smiling through our forest trees, Or spring's soft bloom, Were gifts of present God,—what death, what tomb Can hold thee, or what frost-bound gloom? II Surely thou livest yet: Surely thy well-loved Lord hath found for thee By the grey waves of some celestial sea A home where, winged with rapture, thou mayest be; The ferns are sweet Still as of old in Hampshire, but thy feet No more the pliant fern-fronds meet. III Still burst the heavy seas Along the shores of Devon, and the sands Gleam yellow underneath the moon's white hands, And glad girls' laughter fills the summer lands; The sweet spring-breeze Wafts countless subtle scents across the leas; The June-green deepens in the trees. IV But, singer, where art thou? Singer; for poet ever at heart thou wast. Never, in age, the sweet gift wholly passed Away from thee,—thou sangest till the last; Thou singest now Mayhap in heaven; new high dreams flush thy brow; Thy soul anew the gods endow. V The strange wild Western shores That thou didst love,—wherein thy youthful dreams Took shape,—still bask beneath their fierce sun's beams; Upon them still the tropic rain-storm streams; They throb to oars Still,—still the unaltered wondrous white moon pours Light through green depths no foot explores. VI No bright ship cleaves the foam Of the far weird Pacific misty seas, Wafted by pleasure of the lazy breeze, Making for dim dark line of level trees, But thou dost roam In spirit along with it, and seek'st thy home Beneath that fierce sky's burning dome. VII No Amyas fronts the seas With godlike figure at the vessel's prow Tall,—yet a godlike form we worship—thou Broodest angelic where the tree-tops bow To languid breeze; Yea, crowned thou standest 'neath the strait palm-trees Whose fronds o'er-droop the emerald leas. VIII That far land is thine home Beyond all lands,—save only this that found Delight unspoken in thy harp-string's sound As thou didst find delight in green wild ground And wild grey foam Of England; if for a space thy foot did roam, Again ere long our hills it clomb. IX And in that Western land The tender Rose of Torridge bloomed anew, And on her track the fiery good ship flew Manned by the old stalwart strong Devonian crew: At love's command The English lover, grim, forlorn, and grand, Followed the dark-browed Spanish band. X Then Ayacanora came, And all her passion fell at Amyas' feet, Ardent with Southern blood and savage-sweet, And than her own swift forest fawns more fleet And hot as flame: A woman worth a strong man's toil to tame And bend to perfect wifely aim. XI What gifts we owe to thee! Never hath soul been sadder for thy song Or sinfuller; but like thine East wind strong Thou blewest a blast that swept away all wrong; Yea, like the sea Thou wast in thy clear splendid purity, And like the sun in golden glee. XII The women of England came One-souled, one-hearted, laying upon thy tomb Tender rose-blossoms of their hearts' best bloom, And o'er the land swift swept a sudden gloom, And then a flame Of love and tender worship when thy name Was joined to those whom death's shores claim. XIII Better we are that thou Hast trodden our shores and with thy radiant face Left springlike memories bright in every place; And, if the future full God's utmost grace Of heart and brow Christ for a moment hid from thee, God now Shines splendider, and all hearts bow: XIV Shines splendider for thee; For through thy words God's sudden grandeur leapt And God's bright foot was with us while we slept And thrills of wondrous hope through heart-strings crept And filled the sea With marvel of sweet light and every tree With dawn's gold spotless purity. XV Thou knewest not of the time When all strong men with Christlike face should seek The eternal Father's face,—so thou didst speak Old truths with new-born flush upon thy cheek And in thy rhyme Didst struggle upward towards the old heights sublime That Christ's brave footsteps dared to climb. XVI The future shall transcend Thine utmost dreams: the soul of Man shall flower With undiscernible unhoped-for power And England shall be foremost in that hour; Yet thou, O friend, Thy passion of heart and fervent brain didst lend Unknowing towards this self-same end. XVII Greater there are than thou: Spirits in whom the Sun of spirit shines Direct,—whose souls amid the mountain-pines Are nursed, and by the long waves' foam-capped lines; Who, rugged of brow, The future's green untouched divine meads plough And only at God's own mandate bow. XVIII The Church to thee was king, King for a time,—when the old bright dreams less fair Shone and less urgent in maturer air And bloom of passion flamed not, and thy rare Pure lyre did ring Less oft, and seldomer thy soul did sing; When weary at last down-drooped thy wing. XIX But for thy brave sweet days We bless thee, Kingsley; for thy young glad voice Bidding each English valiant soul rejoice And all true spirits make heroic choice; Yea, green fresh bays Thou wear'st for ever for those early lays Sung in the English bright sun's blaze. XX We bless thee most of all For keen-edged fiery words that cursed and slew The foul hell-nightmare, smiting through and through The Church's armour as with sword-stroke true; Ere thou didst fall, Tender as Christ, imperative as Paul, Flame down from heaven thou once didst call: XXI Flame to consume and smite For ever the evil hell-dream and the band Of priests who fashion it with curséd hand: Yea forth against their myriads thou didst stand With face made bright By open vision of God, and God's own light,— Clothed in a man's unmeasured might. XXII For this we bless thee most: But also for the souls thou broughtest here, Making them more than living spirits dear,— For Amyas, Hereward, and for the clear Soul whom the host Of Pagans slew and sent a sinless ghost, Hypatia, towards heaven's eager coast. XXIII And for thy pity too We love thee: fair Pelagia crowneth thee With her own final deep sweet purity; And for thy love of our own grey wild sea And streamlets blue And for all noble work thine hand did do We love thee, English spirit true. XXIV Not one red gay sea-weed Upon our shores but oweth to thine hand Somewhat: “Glaucus.” strange treasures of the deep to land Thou brought'st and gav'st us heart to understand And head to heed All deep-ribbed flowers and shells of sandy mead, Teacher divine in every deed. XXV And thou didst take delight In children too and through their fairy-land Didst wander, laughing with them, hand in hand: “The Water Babies.” In heaven around thee children-spirits band By day, by night, Now surely, and thou with face for sheer love bright New golden fairy-lore dost write. XXVI For ever the fair feet Of loftiest poets linger yearningly Beside the early ripples of life's sea Where sounds the laugh of children and their glee In music sweet: There Shakespeare, Shelley, Hugo, one may meet, Resting awhile from mid-song's heat. XXVII Yet in first days how fierce And urgent was the Apollonian glow Of passion in thee,—how thy sword did go Flickering athwart the steel ranks to and fro, As thou didst pierce Ignoble souls with sword-thrust of thy verse, Winged as a god's swift lightning-curse! XXVIII And how divinely thee The beauty of woman dawned on like a spell: “Yeast.” How tenderly her girlish footstep fell; How sweeter than all may-bloom in the dell Argemone Burst like a sudden blossom from the lea, White with all first love's purity! XXIX We love and value thee For that creation of thine early power Beyond all,—that Shakespearian woman-flower, The whitest and the sweetest on thy bower Where many be— Valentia, Lucia, Grace: thy love we see Alone in sweet Argemone. XXX Art thou with her to-day? Was she not real? Did never her sweet hand Open for thee the golden genius-land And was it not her real rose-breath that fanned, Upon its way, Thy flame of valiant force,—no time can slay What love's own pencil doth portray. XXXI Nor can the arrow of time Slay thee the lover. Thou hast reached a goal Worthy, we doubt not, of thy kingly soul: Past mortal winds that rage and waves that roll In some calm clime Beyond the jarring shocks of sin and crime Thou leadest now a life sublime. XXXII Our hearts need not despair: Somewhere thou livest,—as thy flowers return Each year with petals that with new life burn And in thy Devon valleys the bright fern Again is fair; So thou art risen again to summer air And sight of summer seas elsewhere. THE RESURRECTION OF VENUS From the new white waves every year she rises And brings new bloom To earth and tender soft undreamed surprises And fresh perfume. Splendid, a new-born rose, a flower begotten Each year anew, She quits the old plains and lanes whose boughs hang rotten Where rosebuds grew. To each, as each awakes to Venus' splendour, His time brought nigh, She seems a maiden white, a girl most tender, Whose soul doth sigh! The rose, the violet, and the lily gracious In soft sweet arms She holds,—and thrills the hills and forests spacious With unseen charms. Never was woman half so proud and peerless,— So each one dreams; Each bounds to meet her, trusting her and fearless, With glance that gleams. Ah! English youths; the Grecian waves beheld her Long ere ye came! Greek arms and Roman straining oars impelled her O'er seas of flame. In old-world forests she more white than lily Has, flowerlike, gleamed; Her eyes have flashed o'er trackless regions hilly Till the hills dreamed! And now late in the arduous day ye find her, And ye are strong And think to fetter her white neck and bind her And lead along. But ye know not that she has fettered races With white soft hand: That round her crowd dark bearded haughty faces From every land! Think ye that English hearts and hands can bind her Whom not these bound Or that the old hands and proud hearts have resigned her Whom ye have found? Is she an English rose? Was she not sweeter Than English bloom Long ere the first love laughed in English metre Through English gloom. The strange old lands and wild fierce cities held her Whom ye adore: In Athens, Rome, and Carthage she the elder Made peace and war. So, English lovers, when ye have possessed her, Remember ye Whose lips and former passionate hands caressed her, By what bright sea. And think not that her eyes, like virgin fountains, Are soft and deep For you alone: by the old forgotten mountains Where dead gods sleep They smiled as virginal and pure and simple And calm and clear; Her soft cheek showed the changeless maddening dimple That maddens here. For, ever, couched in meadow-sweet and roses She changeless lies, The changeless spirit of spring,—and love reposes Within her eyes, And laughter rests upon her lips for ever And never tires; Nor can the spirit of joy from her hands sever His harps and lyres. Beautiful, deathless, sweet-limbed, wondrous, holy, Divine, supreme, Immaculate, a maiden pure and lowly, A gold-haired dream, A woman passionate and wild and fearful, A mouth most sweet, Eyes exquisite and soft with love and tearful, Breasts where flowers meet, Such is she, such she hath,—and all the ages But swell her song And turn for her fresh perfumed passion-pages, A ceaseless throng. And she the very spirit of pure dominion To whom God gives Insatiable and fierce fatigueless pinion That all that lives May worship and obey and may revere her,— She springs afresh From each new summer's seas with white and clearer Foam-radiant flesh, And fills the flowers with all her beauty deathless And fills the air Till the deep skies yearn o'er her pale and breathless, Swept by her hair. 1881. APOLLO AND VENUS Hast thou for ages heartless and regardless Held on thine even way, Now sung by passionate yearning hearts, now bardless Save for thy wild waves' lay? Has thou pierced saddened souls beyond all number And made worlds wail and weep, Yet changed not thy soft unimpassioned slumber Nor moved thy lashes deep? Hast thou reclined on beds of sweet-lipped flowers Only less sweet than thou, And watched the slow wings of the amorous hours, Calm and unmoved of brow? Hast thou been than the trembling sea-shine whiter, More pure than wave-born foam, Tenderer than woodland meadow-sweet and brighter Than flowers that fill thine home? Have men fallen bleeding at thy feet and round thee, Souls great and sweet and strong, And with their passion of ardent being crowned thee,— An endless ruined throng? And hast thou mocked love,—till thy lord Apollo With swift foot after thee Sprang,—and the wave's arch and its lustrous hollow Of green smooth curling sea Failed then to shield thee: for the great god knew thee Though clothed in human form And his gold swift unerring dart smote through thee, Yea, through thy bosom warm; And he now robed in flesh again o'ercame thee And held thee in embrace, Gifted with power alone to seize and tame thee And kiss thy glowing face. Thou yieldest unto him: for godlike passion Must ever conquer thee; Mortals thou conquerest,—not in thy strong fashion And not with force of sea And not with valour of clouds and might of waters Can these poor mortals seek; They have their brides among the earth's fair daughters, Fair, temporal, sweet, and weak. But thou not temporal nor of passing rapture But crowned with stars and skies Needest in him who would thy beauty capture Fire and the eternal eyes, And no ephemeral and obscure devotion Or silent sorrowing heart, But all the song of thy loud-singing ocean Of which thou art a part Upon his lips, and in his hands to bring thee Pleasures that know no end, And endless amorous valorous voice to sing thee, And golden bow to bend. All these thou findest in thy lord Apollo Who bringeth starry eyes And flowers from every deep green-cinctured hollow And the pure light of skies And the great voice of seas and breath of mountains And whisper of the air Made sweet at brink of fresh fern-laden fountains And his own face most fair And his own strength to conquer and to hold thee Made his, O queen, indeed,— And his fierce arms to gather thee and fold thee And magic harp to plead And his red mouth to cling to thine, a flower As sweet and far more strong, And for eternal years the conquering power Of his sole deathless song. 1881. ART'S MARTYRS O queen of all Art's martyrs, who bestowest Their more than mortal crown And ever in their inmost spirits glowest, Be gracious and look down; Look down upon thy toiling sons and daughters And lend thy holy aid, For lo! we struggle, tossed by wild white waters, And perish in cold shade. Yea, for a season thou our queen art gracious And then the vision grows Dimmer and more dim, and thy woodlands spacious Made sweet with breath of rose Fade slowly, and thy sacred golden portal Is closed and all dreams sleep, And we who in thy presence were immortal Are chained in darkness deep. Grant us thine help unfailing and redeeming; Support us through the night; Shine thou upon us with thy soft eyes dreaming, And with thy bosom bright. Not crowns we ask in heaven or jewels precious, Not palaces of pearl; Not golden robes, rewards divine and specious,— But where thy wild waves curl Along wild shores we seek thee and would win thee, O queen of all things sweet; Having sure part and share eternal in thee,— Thy bosom for retreat,— Thy mighty hands for saviours and for healers, Thy lips for crown and light, Thy voice to soothe us, strong unwearied kneelers Before thine altar white. The heavenly crowns might fade,—but thou eternal O Beauty, bride and queen, Not crowned with roses fading and diurnal In the highest skies art seen. Thou art the God of all the yearning ages, Thou gatherest them to rest,— Yea every soul that weeps and each that rages, Within thy perfect breast. Thou only art God,—And all the years adore thee Crying, “Holy, O our sweet!” The undying angel-hosts fall low before thee And kiss thy queenly feet. To every rose thou art the sweet white sister, To every flower the bloom,— No lily is white but thou more white hast kissed her And lent her heart-perfume. And we who are ofttimes weary and heart-broken Lift up our souls to thee! Though all men scorn us, yet we have for token Thy smile and thy blue sea. Thy waves we have and all thy winds and seasons Of snow and rain and sun: Clothed round about with these we face man's treasons, Till all our race is run. Thou touchest us,—and all the tumult ceases And we are rocked to rest; Our foemen's swords are snapped in helpless pieces, Shorn is their every crest. Yea, though the day be long and full of labour, At even give us light; Though pain to weariness be closest neighbour, And friends and lovers smite, Yet grant us silent hope and endless patience; Be with us in the gloom: More than reward for speechless tribulations Is one breath of thy bloom— One sound upon the waves of thy soft laughter, One vision of thy feet Upon the enraptured shore,—though death leapt after That deathless vision sweet. Ours be the thorns and thine the flowers,—but love us,— Forsake us not, O queen; Bend in thine holy midnight sky above us And in thy white clouds' sheen; And in the murmur and rush of many waters When the autumn breezes smite The seas, speak thou to thy sad sons and daughters Who struggle towards thy light. And strengthen us that nought may move or turn us From Art's one holy way; Though cold nights chill and blazing noontides burn us And dark foes seek to sway: Yea, though we stand forlorn of mortal aiding, Yet are we not forlorn Nor wholly left to man's malign upbraiding And senseless ceaseless scorn, For though alone we are not alone when splendid Thou shatterest with thy might The darkness round us like tomb-sides extended, And lo! the dark is light: And lo! the music of thy coming lingers Like dawn upon the seas, And at the touching of thy tremulous fingers Thy harp sounds through the breeze; And we are saved, and all our hearts are gladdened Through which the world's spears sprang,— We who were mocked and disbelieved and maddened, Though still we fought and sang. But now more heavenlike than the heaven of heaven Wherein God sits with thee Thou springest forth, with breath more sweet than even In summer o'er the sea, And power as God's, O Beauty, and dominion Within thy sacred hands; And sleep and rest at touching of thy pinion Fall soft o'er seas and lands; And o'er us too falls in the old sweet fashion A measureless soft dream Wherethrough, intense as God's, divine with passion, Thine eyes, most fiery, gleam. AN INVOCATION I Have the roses died completely,—are the voices silent quite That led Keats along the highway towards the heaven's far starry light? Are there glimpses left no longer 'mid the waves of bosoms white? II May a poet sing no longer as that Grecian singer sung, Keats,—whose brow was ever laurelled as his soul was ever young; To whose hand Queen Venus rising from the waters might have clung. III Am I cursed and held a Pagan when I tread the self-same road Where that singer's genial fancy flamed and thrilled and throbbed and flowed, Burned and leaped up heavenward ever, sighed in music soft and glowed? IV Is there room for me too, singing in this weary latter day Of the flowers that Greece saw budding on so many a vernal spray,— Singing of the morning rose-flush though the skies around be grey? V Hath she vanished,—she who held him to her bosom sweet and warm; Shielded Keats in bower sequestered from the harsh world's hail-winged storm; Stood before him, white and awful, an inviolate goddess-form? VI Are not fields as green as ever and the morning airs as sweet And our waves as blue as waters that laughed round her shell-white feet When she sprang from foam untrodden and a world made haste to greet? VII Is not love as tender ever,—are the star-lands not the same? Is the sunrise less resplendent, is the sunset robbed of flame? Were the hills more radiant, think you, when their queen and goddess came? VIII Hath the heart of woman altered,—is her impulse less divine Than when once with love she worshipped only thee, for love was thine? Hath her foot forgot the pathway through the roses to thy shrine? IX Sweet as cowslips are our maidens: were the Grecian girls more fair? Were their soft cheeks touched to beauty by the bright sea's loving air? Had they scent of wave and mountain folded deep in breast and hair? X Surely there are handmaids for thee! singers too, if unafraid We may sing thee and may love thee, not by cares of life down-weighed, Seeking towards thine altar gleaming through the sacred leafy shade. XI Pour thine help and love upon us; as to Keats thou didst disclose All thine hidden beauty blushing like a sudden-opened rose When against the fierce-eyed sunlight it responsive laughs and glows:— XII As to him thou wast for ever new-born, freaked with dainty foam, So for us be maiden-comely, and thy maiden tresses comb On our shores, and make our forests thy tree-pillared endless home. 1881. LOVE-BLOOM: TWENTY-TWO SONNETS (1881) I. A SAINT-FLOWER Because thou art a saint, and clothed in white, Thou art to me the sweetest of all flowers, And far more fragrant are thy beauty's bowers Than those that flaunt their bloom to daily sight. Love is a small thing, when the love is light,— But the great love that mocketh mortal hours And sings the clearer when the storm-cloud lowers, Endures beyond earth's day, beyond death's night. Because thou art a saint, thou art a flower, And thou art woman in that thou art saint, And angel in thy womanhood's pure power, Lily and rose, rich yet most free from taint; Because thou art so pure, lo! love's mouth saith, “Thou art more dainty than a rose's breath!” II. THY YOUNG BEAUTY Didst thou, sweet, wait for me when thou wast young? Yea, have we yearned across the bitter seas, Heart wailing out to heart,—and hath the breeze Of summer round two souls expectant sung? Have the pale past years with one weary tongue Cried out for soul-companionship? the trees Waved with forlorn grey frondage o'er waste leas, And through the stars one hopeless music rung? And, now we find each other, we are barred,— Barred from each other, though the sad souls cry “At length, at length, a recompence is nigh, At length we rest victorious;” weird and hard Seems to our souls the iron hand of Fate, Denying love's bliss at love's very gate. III. THE EARLY WOODS Oh, sweetheart, had I known thee in those days! How sweet thine eyes were in the early air Of life when all fair things are yet more fair; How softly thou didst thread the forest-ways. The breeze of morning wantoned with thy hair As thou didst wander through the wooded hollow: Oh, had mine eager heart been there to follow, What fruit of joy life might have had to bear! 'Tis late to meet when the chill woods are grey, No longer rose-flushed with the dawn of day And beautiful with bloom of early dreams; The rose is not so red, the lily shines Less white, less fragrant are the forest-pines, And hushed is half the laughter of the streams. IV. “I WAITED FOR THEE” I waited for thee: ever did I wait. No music sounded through the shades of night Or when the moon upon the waves was bright Or when the sun swept through the morning's gate Or when the innumerable breakers white Flung at the scowling clouds their angry hate,— But, maddened by the loneliness of fate, I yearned towards thee as towards my soul's own light. I knew thee not,—but music spake of thee And of the sacred beauty of thy breast, And all the voices of the mournful sea Said, “Here is peace for ever, here is rest; Thou shalt outstrip the foot of pain when She Crowneth and endeth thy life's fevered quest.” V. THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA We strive together the far heights to reach. The longing for the mountains and the sea Doth ever, sweetheart, overshadow thee; Ever their music ringeth through my speech. Ours is the rapture of the lonely beach When the white breakers surge tumultuously, And ours the glory of the pine-clad lea; The mountains and the ocean chant to each. Thou art the mountain-air: I am the sea: Thou bringest me the breath of all thy pines And all thy blossoms' beauty and their glee And all the glory of fern-draped inclines And all thy white-plumed streams:—I give to thee My sea-song, born where the grey water shines. VI. OUR SELF-EXISTENCE Through pain we reach a lonely region fair With the immortal mountain-winds of God, Whereunto winds a weird untravelled road, Thrilled by the high song of the mountain-air. The altar of our faithful love is there On the sheer hill-side trackless and untrod; By power of earnest endless passion shod Our feet have climbed the rocks and glaciers bare. And now we stand together on the height And sweeter than the singing of the vale Is this my harp-string that the keen airs smite, And sweeter art thou, rose, though thou art pale Than all the blossoms spread for love's delight Where through green meads the dull-winged zephyrs sail. VII. “IS IT NOT WONDERFUL?” Is it not wonderful that when we meet The whole surrounding world-scene fades away! We are sufficient each to each: we say, “Now do the weary rest,—and rest is sweet.” Thou hast the tenderness of Christlike feet That flush with rose the worldly waters grey; And I? God gives me manhood to convey To thy time-frozen heart new vital heat. So like two gods we blend our souls in one, Lords of all seasons, kings of the wide land, A queen and king with wedded hand in hand,— Gazing triumphant at our long work done, And fearless at the leagues that yet expand Between us and the setting of the sun. VIII. “THOU ART SO GREAT” Thou art so great in spirit and yet so sweet In spirit that whoso lists to sing of thee Must mix his song with the sweet singing sea That surges ever adoring round thy feet, And with the passion of the winds that beat Upon the rocky echoing mountain-sides: Oh, thou art not possessed like common brides Whose hearts at love's tumultuous tides retreat! Nay! thou art as the spirit of the storm, Sublime yet fragrant, wonderful yet warm, Gentle yet terrible, most sweet yet great, Dainty and white as half unfolded flower Yet full of fire and force and life and power, A flame-fledged eagle, and an eagle's mate. IX. THE UNION IN NATURE AND IN MUSIC Thine own soul is of Nature's realm a part, And so we meet within that wide domain: Our lips touch in the ripples of the rain, Ocean's is our own ever-beating heart. Thou crownest me with love,—I with mine Art Crown thee, and with the music of my strain, And with my inmost soul's thorn-crown of pain, And with the dreams that through my spirit dart. Beneath the sacred stars our spirits meet In union wonderful and calm and sweet; But most of all when music floods the place With its strange amorous rapture passing fair, I feel the touch upon me of thine hair, And sink into thy soul's superb embrace. X. “RAPTURE IS HOLINESS” Rapture is holiness: God's lips are near, O tender woman, when thy lips are close And when thy sweet voice ringeth in mine ear,— And when I touch thy bosom's soft white rose Mine heart the eternal Mother-Spirit knows, And when thy beauty bathes my soul in bliss It seems to me that through my spirit goes The thrill of God's ineffable pure kiss: Yea, having thee most surely I have this,— And, holding thee, the heavenly land I hold And hear the heavenly harps and cadences Of sweet immortal song, and joy untold Burns through me like a fiery river deep When in thine arms, like Love's own arms, I sleep. XI. AN ENGLISH FLOWER An English flower thou art and English scenes Hath given thee half thy beauty, and thy face From the wind's mouth that o'er our mountains leans Hath gathered half its bright and wholesome grace; Our rose and lily in lips and cheeks I trace; And all the splendour of untrammelled seas Hath passed into thy spirit,—and thine embrace Is like the English sweet-limbed June-breathed breeze That clings around the clover-scented leas, Copious and gracious,—and thy heart is high And pure and wide and fearless, and thy knees Have never bent save under God's own sky: Nor priest can tame nor frail creed fetter thee, For thou art daughter of the untamed sea. XII. BREEZE, MOON, AND SUN Thou art equal with me,—lo! thou art the breeze That passes sighing o'er the water-way, And I am the wild song within the seas Driving up toward thee the sonorous spray And glimmering sheet on sheet of sea-shine grey; Thou art the moon above the tides at night Glittering above them with most tender ray, And I laugh underneath thy magic light And clothe myself with limitless loud might Of song: thou art the sun,—my free waves follow Thine all-alluring splendour calm and bright, Rising and falling fast in height and hollow; Thou art breeze, moon, and sun,—and I the sea, Swayed by the rapture, chainless soul, of thee! XIII. ALONE On lovers loving in the silent night The holy spirit of spotless God descends And with their souls magnificently blends, Till as their lips touch lo! their souls are white, And as their eyes meet lo! those eyes are bright With the eternal power God's spirit sends: Far-off from home, apart from fame or friends, They rest in God's unutterable light. O love, we were unspeakably alone With Love and God: thou wast alone with me, And I with God who claimed us for his own, And thou with God, and I alone with thee,— While both were summoned to some mystic throne By the great wind of greeting from the sea. XIV. JOINED SPIRITS No more as separate souls we move along,— The work of blending is divinely done; From now till setting of our earthly sun Joined are our voices in one wedding-song. Thou art to me my whiteness,—I thy strong Singer through whom thy laurel-wreath is won; By thee my robe of victory is spun, And mine are the swift thoughts that round thee throng. Never, though all the ages stormed foam-white Upon our path, should they the souls divide: Through all eternity thou art my Bride And I thy stronghold,—thou my soft delight,— I am thine armour and thou art my shield; Even so we traverse the hard-foughten field. XV. IF THOU WERT DEAD! If thou wert dead, O love,—if thou wert dead,— How could one summer sunset dare to gleam Above the ripples of the rosied stream? How could one rose blush into mocking red? If death's wreath whitened round thy dear dark head No leaf of bay would lure my glance again: For thou art as the fountain of my strain, Whence buoyant waters towards the plains are led. If thou wert gone, O love,—if thou wert gone,— How could the thoughtless heartless sun shine on! How could the same chant fill the sea's dull soul And thy same crested waves without thee roll! Would not life's last and sweetest hope have fled, If thou wert dead,—O love, if thou wert dead! XVI. OUR SHIELD We give to others,—give them day by day Of our hearts' best: we strengthen and make whole: We soothe the sorrows of the weary soul; We pour our spirits in eager help away. But for the strength our stronger souls convey To theirs, what gift is ours? what glad return Of strength is given us when our own hearts burn, When we lie sleepless till the morning grey? If we shield others, God behind us stands, A strength perpetual, a surpassing power, And guards us with invincible great hands: He seeks us out in sorrow's loneliest hour And gives us, for our fellows' sympathy, The sun's kiss and the friendship of the sea. XVII. THE PROMISE OF SPRING When spring's hand wakes the meadows and the plains, And the bright cowslips in the wet low fields Flash through the grass their shining yellow shields, And the gay daffodils repay the rains, And fern-fronds cluster in the high-banked lanes, And, trembling at the sword the sun's hand wields, Each morn the iron-footed North Wind yields, While inch by inch the fragrant West Wind gains:— Then, love, we too the promise of the air Partake: we know that for our souls as well Breathes forth in heaven the spring-tide, and the smell Of violets, and that one day, calm and fair Will burst upon us God's immortal sky Beneath whose rays no soul-flowers ever die. XVIII. THE GLORY OF SUMMER The glory of summer with its banks of rose And fields of blossoms, and its moonlit night Flooded with marvellous entrancing light, And dewy plains whereover love's foot goes, Is as our sacred love—wherethrough there glows Passion, divine, and limitlessly bright: Passion which deepens as the hours take flight; Passion which scorns the pale thought of repose. In all the life of summer we are one: One in its splendour and triumphant power; One with its every star and leaf and flower And moon and wave and cloudless heaven and sun; One with it in its most luxuriant hour, And in its sorrow,—when its life is done. XIX. THE CALM OF AUTUMN Then autumn comes,—and the wild woods retain, Sighing, their golden splendour for awhile, Maddened at heart for lack of summer's smile And all the reckless glory of her reign. Calm settles down o'er valley, hill, and plain, And quiet meadow and red-leafed defile,— And fair blue glimpses in the skies beguile, Nor yet the first frost stiffens in the lane. The calm of autumn round our brows we bind, Love, for a circlet: not the summer day Brought more of peace than this sky cold and grey And this soft-whispering faint unfiery wind, And, in the West, the sunset's tender rose, Wherethrough the soul of all past passion glows. XX. THE REST OF WINTER And then comes perfect peace: the leaves are dead And not one trace of summer lingers now Within the woods; yet summer round our brow Its own eternal coronet hath shed, And we are summer-souled, and crowned with red Blossoms that never for the winter bow Fear-darkened petals or subservient head, Or even the stress of autumn mists allow. Spring we have had, and summer, and the gay Death-gilded foliage of the autumn day, And winter now with snows about us stands; But, dying into life, we heed him not, For in our spirits great gold June-suns hot Exult with great exuberant deathless hands. XXI. THE SEA-SANDS' GOLD How can I cease to sing? thou art not soon Exhausted, fathomed, done with—like a girl Who claims one sonnet on a golden curl, And that's the scope and end of passion's tune! Thou art as endless as the endless moon That broods above the waters as they swirl, Not twice the same,—now white, now silver-pearl, Now golden-red: thou art my boundless June. Thou art my love, my summer, my delight; If to the end of time my spirit sang, Yea, chanted upward to the August night, And if round listening stars my harp-string rang, One half of all my love would not be told,— For it is countless as the sea-sands' gold. XXII. MEASURELESS For thou art measureless as are the seas: Thy soul is as the solemn waters grey When ships traverse their spaces day by day And mark their colour deepen with the breeze. Blue now they are, afar from rocks and trees; So thou art boundless, and thy spirit partakes The silent force of silent mountain-lakes, And all the passionate unrest of these. When the storm strikes thee lo! thou art divine. Thy waves climb upward, seeking the dark sky, And I stoop downward, yearning to be thine, And rustle with my soul through mountain-pine, Or in the depth of thy blue shadows lie Cloudlike, till all thy moans are one with mine. ANOTHER ALICE I Crowned not with sea-shine fair, But with dim London air, Another laughing Alice holds my hand: Her eyes are gentle brown And velvet-black locks crown Her brow, waved gently band above black band. II Not by the old sweet sea Her bright glance pierces me, But in the midst of grey and wintry gloom: In London fog and smoke, Not 'mid green birch and oak And all the uncounted miles of heather-bloom. III Not 'mid the golden corn Where first love's bliss was born; Not by the green deep cliff-side or the sea; Not on the purple moors Where the high air allures; Not by the berried mountain-ash are we, IV O Alice of the town, With deep-black locks for crown, And eyes whose lustre not the sea could make Sweeter,—and breast as white As foam that through the old night Upon the old glimmering marvellous beach did break. V For life has on its way Surged twelve years since the day When all the springlike passionate fields were green Around the treading light Of her who shone with bright Swift beauty amid those meads a very queen. VI And now, i' the later day, I gather from life's spray Thy tender beauty, and thy kiss is sweet And soft and warm and close Though town-wind round us blows And not the breeze that stirs the impulsive wheat. VII Oh! take me by the hand And lead me to love's land Though love seem far-off in the weary town; Show me that love is fair Not only in mountain-air, Not only amid the breeze from thymy down; VIII Show me that thou art white As Alice lost to sight, O Alice unveiled where no flowers adore Thy beauty,—but I alone Mark magic in thy tone, While past the window London's wild wheels roar. IX Inspire me with thy face, For never in any place Where woman's beauty shines are flowers forlorn, Or grasses destitute, Or the stars' music mute, Or barred the impassioned gateways of the morn. X Thy satin-black pure hair Upon thy neck is fair Though mountain-wind caresses not its folds, And all the summer sea Shines in the eyes of thee, And flowers thine hand, though empty of blossoms, holds; XI For never yet the hand Of woman, passion-planned, Lacked blossomy balm of touch, and tender grace Of flowers from all the South Is fervid on her mouth, And flush of more than rose is on her face. XII So cover thou, sweet, me With rapture of the sea And glory of the summer and with grand Immeasurable delight As of the August night By starlike air-soft touching of thine hand! XIII Thy name hath music's might And all the old delight Leaps burning, thrilling, through me at the sound: Again I seem to be By the old silver sea, With summer's fragrant darkness closing round. XIV Again the clear waves shine In far fierce foam-edged line; Their old impetuous music shakes the shore; The earlier Alice stands Light-footed on the sands,— Her golden laughter charms me as of yore. XV The clover fields are sweet With passage of her feet, And all my soul is gladdened at her touch: O Alice of to-day Who dost this gift convey, If but for this, I have to thank thee much! XVI Because thou hast the name That once was God's own flame To lead me up the mountain-land, and be My talisman of might; Because thy breast is white,— Yea, white as foam that lined our foam-sweet sea: XVII Because thou hast to-day Helped love upon love's way And turned love's solemn gaze past years that flee Towards meadow-sweet as white As thou art, love, to-night, And towards the old changeless grandeur of the sea: XVIII Because thou hast indeed When flowers had run to seed And dreary drooped the branches of life's tree Become a blossom new, Draped tenderly with dew, As once a flower was dew-kissed by the sea: XIX Because thou art divine, This wreath for thee I twine, Yea, lay this song at unexpectant feet; For surely for thy name At least, thou well mayest claim Some service of my lyre, some homage meet. XX Thou hast made the London day Bright with the sea-shine grey, And splendid with a memory of a face More beautiful than thou; Yet for this gift I vow Thou hast for ever in my song a place! XXI While lovers read my song, O brown-eyed maid, so long Shalt thou within their hearts and my heart be; The girl whose beauty made Dim London like a glade Voluptuous with the rapture of the sea: XXII Whose beauty made the air Of even grim London fair And brought the sense of summer back to me And made the dark street shine With line on sudden line Of moon-led breakers thundering in from sea: XXIII Whose beauty made the street Smell all of meadow-sweet And all the pavement blossom like the lea Where the sea-grasses grow In grey-green stalwart row, Most amorous for the wind's kiss and the sea: XXIV Whose beauty made my heart With sudden bound and start Lay hold upon the old unforgotten glee, The joy youth's ardour planned Where, in thought's changeless land, My love for ever watches the grey sea: XXV Whose softness made the air With sudden joy aware Of subtle scents from many a summer tree; Whose whiteness made may-bloom Flash white across the gloom, White as the flashing whiteness of the sea: XXVI Whose softness thrilled my soul And round about it stole Till all my being stormed forth rapturously To seek and find and claim The woman with thy name, The other Alice,—Alice of the sea: XXVII Whose softness was a sense Unearthly, an intense New gift of living love, a golden key To unlock passion's land And place in mine the hand That once evaded love's hand by the sea: XXVIII Whose splendour was as new As a spring morning's dew Or as the June sun's morning breath when he Pours life upon the hills And all the tossing rills Laugh upward towards his face, as laughs the sea: XXIX Whose splendour flung a veil Of passion, sweet and pale, Around,—a tender robe of purity; And made swift thoughts divine Along the spirit shine, As shine the glimmering surges of the sea:— XXX So, Alice, till the waves Roll only over graves Mix thy name with the name that still must be Higher than all names,—and blend Till time itself doth end With the endless boundless passion of the sea. 1881. ALICE OF THE SEA I The wild sweet stainless sea Was as the soul of thee, O Alice of the sea, and of the bower Where Love in tender light With face and body bright Shone through youth's one divine impassioned hour. II Not any dreary town Thou hadst, O love, for crown,— But all the untrodden deep impetuous waters Urgent in gathered wrath Were strenuous round thy path, O fairest-eyed of all earth's fair-eyed daughters! III The endless hopes of youth Were thine, and fervent truth Waved round thy form exultant her white wings, And glittering fancies past Before thee on the blast And many sacred dreams of many things, IV Not in the August air Alone, love, thou wast fair, But in the days of dreams that followed thee; By hills of other lands The magic of thine hands Was felt, and thy foot fell by many a sea. V Never a summer came But in the robe of flame And flowers that wrapped each summer's soft shape round Thou wast,—and the urgent seas Still washed as toward thy knees And still thy beauty winter's chains unbound. VI Into the strange dim land Of Poesy thine hand Imperious and girl-queenly beckoned me: And there I found again With throbs of joy and pain The clear divine unaltered spirit of thee. VII Though round about my head, Now the old dream hath fled, Loves many and of other shores have bound Red flowers, and white and pale, Are such wreaths of avail If on life's lintel once thy foot doth sound? VIII If once the sense of seas Comes, and of gracious breeze That o'er the wide luxurious tideway hovers, How vanishes the town, And all its gateways frown, While smile the sandy cliffs and short oak-covers! IX Again the ripples dance Before our eager glance, O Alice of the giant-memoried sea: And suns long-hidden shine, And pliant gold woodbine I weave into a circlet meet for thee. X Thy beauty made the air Of summer yet more fair And every rose of summer softer still: Thy sweetness made the days Diviner and my lays Flash forth like light-beams sparkling down a rill: XI Thy splendour made the white Waves but a lesser sight And all the moonbeams but inferior rays: Thy glory made my dreams Resplendent with wild gleams,— Made marvellous the far-lit water-ways: XII Thy softness made each morn A joy-god newly born: Thy tender love was as the hand of thee Moulding all things anew Beneath emergent blue That flamed no more storm-shadowed o'er the sea: XIII Thy laughter made the land No more a waste of sand Whereover hopeless roamed youth's shuddering tread, But one wide land of flowers Wherethrough the honied hours On wings of quivering rainbow-rapture sped. XIV No more when thee I saw I felt the old strong awe Of poets, singers elder and divine; I knew that I might meet, Because thy mouth was sweet, Fearless their long and laurel-crownéd line. XV I knew that through thy strength My power would come at length And that my grey-eyed Alice of the sea Among their loves would stand, A queen amid the band Of English queens through the wild harp of me. XVI I stood forth,—and I sang; Sometimes with sorrow-pang Smitten, and sometimes pierced with dart of glee; But ever in my sight Keeping thy grey eyes' light And the old light that glistened o'er our sea. XVII That this one thing be done Ere solemn set of sun I've vowed,—and struggle towards it as I may; That thy name may be high 'Mid names that cannot die, When comes for me the closing of my day: XVIII That, when no sound again Is heard, no new love-strain, No further voice or lyre or harp of me, Still may thy memory cling, A pure immortal thing, To the world's heart as deathless as the sea: XIX That, when the new harps come And men seek back for some Fairest of those who filled to-day with glee, They may with rapture find This singing-wreath I've twined About thy brows, O lady of the sea: XX With rapture not for sake Of this the song I make, But for the sake of thee the song's white flower; Oh, may the future know Thy beauty, when I go, Silenced at mine inevitable hour! XXI New queens of love will shine, New waves, as white a line, Sweep upward, thundering o'er the yellow sands In autumns crisp and fair,— But will the new years bear As sweet a woman as thou for new glad lands? XXII Will others of thy name Come, not the very same, But even as fair, with singers at their feet? Will even our old woods thrill To voices and the hill For these be whitened with fresh meadow-sweet? XXIII Yes:—many a rose most red Though thou and I be dead Shall cast imperious perfume through the land, And many women fair Wind wonderful dark hair Or golden ringlets, shining band on band. XXIV The new glad streams shall sound And new delight abound And new loves' silvery laughter fill with glee The woods where we with slow Step wandered long ago; Again young hearts shall dream beside our sea. XXV But ever through my song The same waves sound their strong Triumphant pæan,—and the streams pervade The woods with silver speech And moons illume the beach And white flowers fill the tangled forest-shade. XXVI In song they speak again; My singing is the fane Wherein thou art enshrined with all thy flowers; There is not one which fails, From all those summer vales, To adorn thine own perennial singing-bowers: XXVII Not one bud pale and dim But blossoms in my hymn; Not one moon-silvered wavelet but doth sound Within the singing walls Wherethrough my spirit calls To thee; wherein thine answering soul is found: XXVIII Not one rose but is grand Within the singing-land, And oh, thou sea-sweet woman, thou art there Never diviner yet, Nor tenderer eyelids wet; Never more queenly,—never yet more fair: XXIX Unchanged and as of old Thine hand in mine I hold Within the singing-temple I have made, And through its arches clear Thy ringing laugh I hear And robelike round me falls love long-delayed: XXX And with our words the tides Mix, on the same shore-sides, And voices of the woods,—thy soul and me Blending in love as fair As August morning's air When first we met, O Alice of the Sea! 1881. THE DEAD POET I “Leave him to me, ye roses which he sought, And all ye hills and vales,— And all ye green-robed dales Made lovelier now for ever by his thought. II “Leave this dead poet unto me,” God said: “And all ye women fair Whose sweet breath and whose hair Round him for passion's aureole was shed. III “Ye understood him not: the waves he sang Were deaf and mute and blind And soulless, and mankind Was soulless too,—while yet his harp-string rang. IV “Though women loved him, yet they held him not As I, his God, can hold And round about him fold Arms sweeter than rose-sprays in sunniest spot. V “He has become a very part of me; And ye who pierced and slew And ran your keen swords through His bleeding yearning spirit,—where are ye? VI “Ye pass away like morning from the deep:— But I with great glad hands Wind soft pure white grave-bands Around the man and rock the soul to sleep; VII “That when the resurrection great stars rise He may arise and meet With conquering smile and sweet The woman's soul in mine, his true God's, eyes. VIII “I am his love,—I, God; I bear away The heart that not one heart Loved and brought not a dart As well as love,—yours is the form ye slay! IX “But mine is the strong soul that, loving each, Would not forsake, but held Till all his power was quelled By death,—the soul that strove my love to teach. X “And now ye have him not: he finds in me More than ye gave of rest; More than most tender breast Of woman gave of closest sympathy. XI “I the great God-bride hold him, and I close Above his toil-worn head The eternal arms that shed Fragrance about him holier than the rose; XII “And with mine awful spirit-thrilling kiss I make mine own what ye Had, and ye would not see,— And mix my deathless woman-soul with his.” HYMN [Lift me far beyond the region] Lift me far beyond the region Where frail earthly loves abound: Rose-sweet lips on earth are legion,— Myriad flowers star earthly ground,— Lift me, God, to thine own dwelling Where thy ceaseless love is welling Forth, and thy great peace is found. Lo! I weary of all the passion That the old pale earth provides: Women's lips and love's same fashion, Flowers and laughter, songs and brides: Take me where some love is deathless; Plant me 'mid thy snow-peaks breathless; 'Mid the plunge of thy great tides. I am weary; but I follow, God, the blood-marked track of thee: Sweetest songs of earth sound hollow By the music of thy sea: Take me where eternal truth is; Where thy love shines, where thy ruth is; Mould thy likeness into me. Far beyond the earth's green places, Haunts of flowers and women fair, Rose-flushed cheeks and wondrous faces, Set me 'mid thine icy air: Give me thine own love immortal; Open thou the sky's blue portal; Let me pass, and find thee there! MY LOVE By the old strange seas loud-breaking Lo! my love for ever stands, And the waves the shingle shaking Are not whiter than her hands; And her breath is sweet as roses That the dewy morn discloses When June holds the laughing lands. Never, though the swift years perish, Shall she quit that ancient shore, And the flowers her sweet hands cherish Shall be sweet for evermore: And the seas' eternal metre For her sake shall echo sweeter As their endless chant they pour. Ever, young and pure and tender, Doth she wait by those far streams, And the summer shares her splendour And the waves her girlish dreams, And the stars and clouds adore her, And the gentle night folds o'er her Darkness, and soft moon-spun gleams. Alice! not in later regions Is the true sweet form of thee, But where our winged dreams in legions Foam-light, mixed with foam-white sea: There art thou, and I, for ever, And the flying years part never That eternal dream from me! THE CHILD'S HEART SONNET The child's gold hair is full of summer sun; The child's soft laugh is like the rippling sea, Silver, and full of thoughtless harmless glee; She gives thee all her treasures seen of none. But thou who hast the child's white spirit won, Be heedful with it,—fling it not away; Remember there may come a day—a day— When no swift childish feet by thine may run. Be heedful of her; if she weary thee, Be patient: bear with folly, for love's sake: Fruit of thy travail thou shalt one day see; Small things make weaker hearts and childlike ache; Great is the worth of spotless purity; Be gentle with her, lest the child's heart break. July 2, 1881. A JULY SONG I The year is flying, dying,— Soon its flowers will flee; Its tender soft red roses, Its leafy verdant closes,— Soon autumn will be crying, “What is left for me?” II The old loves are flying, dying,— With all their soft-voiced glee; Their ripples of sweet laughter And kisses that came after,— The fruits of love are lying Low now beneath love's tree! III The days are flying, dying,— Soon bloom no more will be; The great green leaves so splendid With brown tints will be blended, The desolate wind go sighing Across waste marsh and lea! IV Our passions flying, dying, Breathe glory once, then flee; Their summer hues forsake them,— The cold winds spurn and break them,— Their petals low are lying Beneath love's wind-tossed tree! V No word of hope comes flying Across wan leagues of sea: Our weariness increases Now that June-laughter ceases,— Our hopes are sighing, dying, That blossomed fair and free! VI The golden corn is lying Bright-gold upon the lea: But all its rich deep splendour Outblossoms not the tender Spring-leaves that June saw dying,— That now dead-brown we see. VII Late loves come flying, sighing,— White wings across time's sea; They are not winged with gladness That mocks pale autumn's sadness,— They are late and faint and dying,— Their lips are nought to me. VIII A sound of song comes flying Across far straits of sea: The sound of early singing When love's white hand was clinging, Ere yet the flowers learnt dying, With tender clasp to me. IX My heart goes flying, sighing, O'er vale and mount and lea; Seeking for one whose glances Were once love's flame-tipped lances,— A form in dreams descrying Which I shall never see! THE MOUNTAIN-YOUTHS AND THE VALLEY-MAIDENS Mountain-youths. The high hills beckon us,—we must be climbing, Not lingering in this valley-land, love-rhyming; Our path is steep: Valley-maidens. Nay; rest awhile amid the valley-roses; Soft to the weary eyelid are green closes, And soft is sleep. Youths. Lo! the high sun upon the mountains yonder Beckons; if foot be frail or heart would ponder, What hope abides? Maidens. Within our arms are dreams that man may treasure, And rest divine, and sweetness beyond measure; Choose us for brides! Youths. Our brides are mountain-peaks and snow-fields colder If not more white than white seductive shoulder; Ye do not well: Maiden. Yet take this rose soft-scented from my bosom; Amid the high peaks it may smile and blossom,— Sweet is the smell! Youths. The flowers of noble labour 'mid the mountains Are sweeter than your limpid bubbling fountains And valley-dew: Another Maiden. My hair is black; will one of you not take me? Are ye all cowards and heartless to forsake me, Ye climbing crew! Youths. The sun's gold robe on the high peaks extended With silver-tissued flying clouds is blended; Our wings must soar! Another Maiden. My hair is gold; wilt thou not just once kiss it? One kiss!—thou 'ilt never amid the high peaks miss it! Just once; no more! Youths. Nay, far beyond these things our mission takes us; Desire of lowly common joys forsakes us; We seek a star: Maidens. Ah! there are women 'mid those high peaks surely; Maidens who wait you,—and their eyes demurely Watch from afar. Youths. No maidens; only the high blue sky's glances And the swift light that round the hill-top dances And the arms of death: Maidens. And here ye have the arms that never weary; Forget the snow-clad wastes, the passes dreary, The ice-fields' breath! Youths. And if we quit the mountains and their splendour Can ye be true and pure of heart and tender As were our dreams? Maiden. Kiss me, and cease the old mad perverse endeavour; The highest hill-tops man shall traverse never; Rest by these streams! Youth. Ah! ye are real, and all the dreams were meagre; And ye are young and tender-lipped and eager; How hard to choose! Maiden. See now I bare for thee my naked bosom,— A white unkissed unblemished maiden blossom,— Canst thou refuse? Youths. Ah! all the old dreams adown the wind are sailing And ardour's plumes, alert before, are failing; The mountains fade: Maidens. And our rose-lips advance to hail and greet ye; Our wondrous singing subtle mouths entreat ye; Here is deep shade! Youths. Ah! spirits fair within your soft embraces Fold us, and soothe the sad storm-beaten faces In tight arms pressed: Maidens. Yea we will hold you, till the dream ye cherish Seems but as last year's flowers that fade and perish, Till tired hearts rest: Mournful voices of the mountain-maidens heard dimly from afar. We would have given you all ye sought of pleasure,— Yea, even immortal passion's priceless treasure, Nor wronged your quest! TO ? Lo! the poet sings to roses And the hours of summer days: In the woods his heart reposes Where the white-armed nymph delays: He may watch the chaste adorning Of the golden-haired sweet morning, Unrebuked for ardent gaze. Through his heart storm strife and anguish; All his soul is racked with pain; Often through long hours that languish Must he garner song's red grain: Thou,—thou hast no heart to suffer; When the surges' heads grow rougher Thou in harbour dost remain! When the great seas' hoary splendour Shines beneath the grey low sky, Thou art vanquished: when the tender Flakes of rainbow-froth soar high, Thou art safe in inland region; Though the forms of gods were legion, Storm-tossed, thou wouldst not be nigh. What knowest thou of woman's passion, Pedant with the mincing tread? Woman loves not in thy fashion; Not for thee the rose is red: Not for thee divine emotion Yearns forth, rippling like the ocean,— Thou, alive, art worse than dead. Thou to teach us, thou to reach us With thy simpering silly ways! Thou to impugn us and impeach us! Thou to chisel and chip our lays! Thou to teach us love's true beauty And to point towards path of duty,— What damnation were thy praise! DEATH The mantle of a vast exceeding peace Over the lonely wandering poet fell: The noises of the worldly war did cease, And all was well. Some understood him better, now that death Had folded round him its embrace secure And breathed upon him with its awful breath Most sweet, most pure. The women who had followed through wild ways With love and longing in most tender hands Brought him his roses and his wreath of bays Plucked in lone lands. But over him fell sweet unbroken sleep And rest divine that nought could change or mar; One woman watched his grave with great grand deep Gaze like a star. Nought moved her from his grave: his other queens Sought other pleasures,—bought and sold and slept; But still, where over him the grey stone leans, This woman wept. They found her there one summer morning dead Beneath the solemn marriage-sealing sun, To his live endless deathless spirit wed,— So these were one. ONE WOMAN They knew him not: do blossoms understand The hand that plucks them and that finds them fair? Do the waves apprehend the stedfast land,— The birds the air? They knew him not: although their tender eyes Seemed sometimes with soft passionate haze to swim; Although with gracious words and gentle guise They followed him. What can the blossoms understand of fire? The gentle doves of swift devouring flame? But one great heart was great as his desire: One woman came. One fiery spirit smote his own with light And stood before him and was not afraid; Most passionate, yet most pure; most strong, yet white; Divinely made. They mingled each with each in awful sleep And knew each other's very inmost soul: Then parted like great sundering waves that leap Lone to the goal. But still they bore away the flame and fire Of each; through each the other's force was poured. The one was strengthened with sublime desire, Renewed, restored: The other's heart was softened as he lay Within the woman's arms so grand and pure, And one white rose of love he bore away That shall endure. And ever in sorrow this great woman's heart Was with him when the others fled and failed: Hard at him lunged grim pain's remorseless dart,— She never quailed. And when his hair with all the night's harsh dew Was wet, she stood beside him in the field; Stood, till once more heaven's midday cloudless blue Burned on his shield. And she would wind about him tender hands, And bring him blossoms fairer than a dream, And lift his spirit towards immortal lands Where great suns beam. Her heart was not as common hearts that glow, Then in one day the ephemeral rapture fades: But she was one with him through joy and woe,— Through sunlit glades And through the dark defiles of sin and death She helped her singer on his perilous way, Making the lone vales blossom with her breath,— Making night day: For she immortal and of ceaseless charm Knew how to wake to might or lull to sleep; Ever within the circle of her arm Was rapture deep: Red bloom of sin and terror drove her not From the sad singer's weary side in fear; She cleansed his life from fleck and stain and spot, With many a tear: Nought severed: but the eternal souls were one And shall be,—while the ages speed or creep,— Through flight of moon and race of fiery sun,— Till all stars sleep. THE SINGER Born under skies of blue, While summer yet was new The singer learnt his strain From flowers of summer days, From scented woodland sprays Sweet with the tender rain— From maidens' lips most fair, From joy of golden hair And souls without a stain. He hath no part with death: But only with the breath Of life and living things; Only with skies and seas And the June amorous breeze That through the forest sings; Only with dawn and night, The pale stars' mystic light, The sea-bird's ghostlike wings. He hath not met despair, But only the strange fair Face that filled all his dream When yet the world was young And only love-chants rung Beside the ocean-stream: What hath December grey And red-leafed autumn day To do with green June-gleam? Right glad is he that June, Yea, the full summer's noon, Beheld him born to earth; For then her days most fair Are filled with sweetest air And greenest is her girth And all the heart of things With silverest laughter rings And with most fluent mirth. When the June-flowers were thick And shafts of June-suns quick The poet-child was born And ever round him grows Thought's patient thornless rose In love with the June-morn And little part hath he With the grey wintry sea And wintry winds forlorn. Born of the English race, Yet all his fervent face Sought Greece, and Greece he knew, And Grecian love of Art Was innate in his heart And love of Southern blue; Yea, 'mid the asphodel Cream-white, his footstep fell, And not 'mid English dew. The power to seize and bind In music for mankind The Beauty that pervades The solemn wind-swept hills And swift white-foaming rills And sacred woodland shades Was his,—and power to meet In wild embrace and sweet The nymphs and forest maids. So, being not of them, No crown nor diadem Did English hands supply: England gave streams and flowers And green-draped fragrant bowers And wealth of deep-blue sky And, at the last, a grave By her sad singing wave And room enough to die. COMPENSATION The poet hath to sing though no man hears, And though the dreary years Bring nought of sympathy: He hath the sun and sea. The poet hath to love though hope be dead And garlandless his head: Though no man take his part, He hath the rose's heart. The poet hath to sing though all his words Be as the notes of birds Flung to the bitter breeze: Yet hath he the blue seas. The poet hath to love though all his brain Be torn with lonely pain: Devoid of love's delight, He hath the sweet wild night. The poet hath to sing though fools surround With mocking weary sound: While the coarse hearer raves He watches the sea-waves. The poet hath to sing though all be dark, Yea not one golden spark: He hath his golden lyre And his own godhead's fire. The poet hath to love though all be lost, Love, reckless of the cost: Travelling the earth flame-shod, With the great stars and God. DEAD! The thick gold hair That was so fair Falls like a mantle round Her body in it wound. The clear grey eyes That shone like skies Are closed: they will not wake Or soften for my sake. The lips so red Are mute and dead: I have waited nigh a week, And yet they will not speak! Never again! There is the pain. And I may seek for tears Through forty years! A JOURNEY The same green hills, the same blue sea,— Yet, love, thou art no more with me! The same long reach of yellow sand,— Where is the touch of thy soft hand? The same wide open arch of sky,— But, sweetheart, thou no more art nigh. God love thee and God keep thee strong! I breathe that pure prayer through my song. I send my soul across the waste To seek and find thy soul in haste. Across the inland woods and glades And through the leaf-laced chequered shades My spirit passes seeking thee: No more I tarry by the sea. For where thou art, am I for ever: Mere space and time divide us never. ON THE DOWNS The sweet air from the downs My fevered forehead crowns: The tossing white-maned sea Lays joyous hold of me. But thou art far away From downs and whirling spray; Skies, winds, and waves once glad, Miss thee,—and all are sad. Not all the shining air That crowns these cornfields fair Is worth one glance of thine That makes all airs divine. Not all the curling seas That kiss the fresh strong breeze Are worth thy soul's white wings And all the peace it brings. VENUS The great sea's infinite repose Is even as when white Venus rose Love-glancing; Ah! is not this her shape that glows Advancing? 'Tis we have changed: the pure sweet sea, Venus, alone is worthy thee; Its splendour Expects thy coming with soft glee Most tender! The seas of Greece were not more fair Than this which shines in August air Before me: The deep sky stretches blue and rare High o'er me. 'Tis we have changed: the sea to-day Is thine as ever in this bay Sun-gladdened; And still thy white limbs mock the spray, Unsaddened! Aug. 21, 1881. OUR LOVE-CROWN Not through the rose-hung honeyed ways Of kisses soft and songs and lays Thou followest me,— But by far lonely foam-filled bays Of sorrow's sea. Through self-denial and the extreme Repression of love's fiery dream Thou followest on: Far heights before us rise and gleam,— We climb alone. Not ours the daily chequered life, Chequered but sweet, of man and wife, But ours the strange Wild ways of lonely constant strife That knows no change. Not ours to meet save in the bliss Of sacrifice, the pale-lipped kiss From cross to cross: This is our life's one love-crown, this,— All else is loss. AT THE LAST When I receive thee bleeding From all the thorn-crowns of the weary years, God having heard our pleading At last with merciful and tender ears, Shall I not find thee fairer For all the horror of the lonely way,— Thee, doomed to be a sharer In my life's skies so bitter, gaunt, and grey? Will not thy lips be sweeter Than rosebud trifling lips of untrained child, And thine embrace completer For all the past nights when pain's winds were wild? And shall not I be nearer And far more meet, O sorrow's queen, for thee, More husbandlike and dearer, For blows of many a surge of pain's grim sea? A POET'S LOYALTY Not to a queen or king Is the deep inmost spirit in me loyal, But to the waves that sing Round English shores, and fling Against our fortressed rocks their mantles royal. A crowned head in my sight Hath little import: flower-crowned hills have more; Our cliffs and surges white, Or blue waves soft and bright That ripple gently on a sunlit shore. No prince or ruler holds The free land of my heart: it dwells amid The heather-purpled wolds And in the green woods' folds,— Yea, 'mid the mountain-steeps my heart is hid. England herself I own For queen, sweet with the laughter of her sea And grand on mountain-throne,— She royal, she alone, Is sovereign of my heart eternally. 1881. BALCOMBE Quiet woods bend o'er me, Tender ferns and sweet Cluster low before me, Kiss my feet. Autumn berries glisten In the hedges dry: Brown birds as I listen Rustle by. Brown eyes shine beside me; Twenty years ago Love vouchsafed to guide me By their glow. Cousin! how we wandered Through these autumn ways, Smiled and laughed and pondered In old days: Threaded all these alleys, Gathered berries red In the green still valleys Where we tread. How swift recollection Brings again the past,— Friendship to affection Changing fast; Twenty years, or nearly, Fold their wings between: Yet for me how clearly Shines each scene! Blackberry-copse and meadow, Heather-purple dell, Pine-trees' fragrant shadow, Azure bell,— Sandy rocky hollow, Trout-stream brown and deep, Wood-side where Apollo, Glad, might sleep,— Boyish thoughts and simple And your laughing eyes And your laughing dimple And grey skies All return as plainly To my gaze to-day, As if thought ungainly Time could slay! All return as clearly As if twenty years Were one winter merely,— One night's tears! Balcombe ferns and heather And your brown same eyes And the autumn weather And calm skies Bring it all before me As if but one night Threw her mantle o'er me Soft and light; Or as if between us But one summer lay:— Twenty Junes have seen us Growing grey. Aug. 29, 1881. BEYOND! Beyond all ferns and flowers: Beyond the sunlit bowers: Beyond the shadow of tree: Beyond the grass-bright lea: Beyond dull hearts and hands, The one who understands! Beyond dull soul and brain, The soul that soothes all pain! Beyond these meadows green, The sea's grey glimmering sheen! Beyond these stifling vales, Sea-breath that never fails! Beyond those far dim downs, The soul that loves and crowns! Beyond flower, field and tree, You and the sea! FAREWELL TO BALCOMBE Farewell, ferns and heather! Cousin with dark eyes! Farewell, golden weather, Cloudless skies: Farewell, Church and river; Farewell, park and mead Where the larches quiver,— Sedge and reed: Farewell, forest gleaming Now with autumn gold Where I wandered dreaming Dreams of old: Farewell, friends whose tender Love and help and care Doubled all the splendour Of soft air; Friends who made the alleys Sweeter from their tread, And the fir-lined valleys Bracken-red: Farewell;—I may never See the heather glow Here again, but ever (That I know) Will my heart remember These glad autumn days; This red-leaved September With me stays: And the friendly faces And the brown trout-brooks And the mossy places,— Silent nooks. All the swift short drama, Trust me, entered deep, Bright as panorama, My soul's sleep,— Waking memories olden That will now abide, Silver-plumed and golden, At my side. Far from forest-glory Must my footstep fly: Far from lichens hoary And clear sky; Far from heather-dingle, Far from ferny dell, Far from pines that mingle Their rich smell; Far from hazel-coppice, Far from blackberry-brake, Corn and grass and poppies, Stream and lake. To the great smoke-city Must I wend my way: Take this farewell ditty, Friends, I pray; Ere I, saddened, leave you, For your kindness long What I can I give you— Just this song! Sept. 21, 1881. FAREWELL! The early days Of lays Were glad with help of friends: Alas! how soon The June Of love and friendship ends. The sky's clear blue How few Will follow in heart and seek. Nay! one by one They shun The glimmering mountain-peak. How long ago The glow Of early passion flamed! How hearts we met Forget The goal at which we aimed! Alone we tread The dead And flowerless mountain-side: We have been true To you— But your high purpose died. O friends so fair Who were— Who started on the quest With us,—hath deep Pale sleep Your wearied souls possessed? Are ye so weak? The peak Still glitters up above. The morning air Is fair With sounds and sights of love. But in the vale Ye wail “The mountains are so high! Why should we dare That air So arid, fierce, and dry? “Why should we quit Sunlit Soft pleasant verdant nooks, Where flowers adorn At morn The green-leaved banks of brooks? “Why should we seek The peak Where white rolled vapours brood? The mountain's head We dread,— That vast weird solitude.” Yea,—so they groan And moan, Knowing not the high hills' charm; Content with their Despair And nerveless slope of arm. “Brothers, good-bye!” We cry— “And sisters weak, farewell! Your heaven of rest, Unblest By toil, to us is hell. “If ye are tired, Nor fired By sweet hope any more, Yet we are strong, And song Is stedfast as of yore. “Ah! while ye slept We kept Our sacred vow to song: And while ye dreamed Love gleamed Our serried ranks among. “We followed through The blue Strange mists song's flying form,— Through thunder-showers And bowers Lurid with light of storm. “And now we near The clear Sweet regions high and far Where love awaits,— The gates Of the gold morning star. “But ye stretch limb In dim Moist valleys soft and green: What part have ye With sea Or sky or mountains' sheen? “Ye loved, and then Again Ye wearied and forsook: Your hearts grew old And cold, And bribes from men ye took. “Yea, ye once swore To soar And all high things to seek; Not valley-flowers, Nor bowers, But the august mountain-peak: “And, having fled, Ye are dead To all high valour now; No dawn of gold For cold Hearts weary of their vow! “Farewell! Farewell! Ye fell— Your wandering steps were weak; Not for your throng The strong High dawn-flushed summits speak.” THROUGH THE NIGHT I Weary we are indeed, for stars are none above us, Nor friends we have to help, nor lovers' lips to love us, But only our own souls to aid us—you and me; Therefore with urgent voice I bid you rise, and mar not The passing fleet-winged days with dreams of things that are not,— Rise and be great and mix with the great-hearted sea! II Lo! evening now descends,—it breathes on thee my blessing; God send the soft flowers' scents and summer dreams caressing! God send thee gracious sleep, though I am not with thee! Sweetest, be glad of heart: the morning light shall find us And, when we least expect, shall burst upon and blind us,— Sweeter than moon that beams to-night upon thy sea. III I would that I were there!—that I with thee were sleeping By those calm moonlit tides, for very passion weeping, Feeling the sweet night close around us tenderly: But since I cannot share the glory, I would follow Thy flight through meadows green and many a blossomed hollow On song's swift wings till I alight beside the sea. IV O love, we are alone: we will not mar the splendour Of our immortal love by word or thought untender? Lo! I am very close to-night,—yea, one with thee. Thou dost not understand: thou art pained; and yet with yearning Beyond all speech to-night I follow thy foot turning Ever with instinct sure towards our untrammelled sea. ONE PERFECT WIFE Not all the flowers and bowers wherein love shines With soft seductive feet Can still the yearning burning heart that pines For one, and but one, woman sweet. Not all the songs and throngs of maidens fair With eyes of many hues Can banish pain and strain and carking care,— One love, but one, we still would choose: That she, immortal, endless, still the same, Might soothe our soul to rest; To shoot love's arrow once, with but one aim, Is wisest after all, and best. Nought else can heal us, save us, bring us peace, Conclude the long wild strife; Light loves but fever us,—all fevers cease When we have found one perfect wife. “BUT WHERE SHALL MAN'S EYES FIND HER? But where shall man's eyes find her?— By shores of dim grey sea? Or under summer tree? Or do the rose-bowers bind her? Long may he seek, and, seeking, Be sick of heart and sere,— Ere falls upon his ear The sound of her soft speaking. Yea, old and sad and weary He shall be ere the dawn Gild forest and wet lawn With light so sweet and eerie. Ere in that light she stands, A Bride for evermore, With heart whence love-floods pour And great immortal hands. HYMN [Along the blood-stained road that Christ's foot trod] Along the blood-stained road that Christ's foot trod We follow hard,— Watching the sweet eyes of the Son of God And his brow scarred. Along the weary lonely devious way We follow him, Through midnight blackness till the morning grey,— Till stars wax dim. Not on his head love's star-crown shone alone; Nay! all may share His glory who will share his sorrow's throne On Calvary bare. If any man will watch throughout the night, Though wild winds roam And on the savage beach the only light Is light of foam, He shall partake the deathless crown that he, The Christ-king wore: An honoured guest at his high table be For evermore. But first must all his hair be wet with dew, And he must stand Lonely beneath the roof of midnight blue In his own land. And each upon his special cross must hang, True till the end; Each pierced by his own individual pang,— Without one friend. Then shall the morning that beheld Christ free See us too rise,— Pure as the white air, strenuous as the sea, With deathless eyes. O SEA! I Here in the teeming city lo! I cry Towards the wide waste of waters:—give to me Harbour of wind and light whereto to fly, O Sea! II Let all men know that though the world's harps choose Full many flower-crowned loves, and bow the knee, I am thy singer,—whom thy breath renews, O Sea! III Here in our England I am far apart From minds of men who know not aught of thee; I am repaid if but I win thy heart, O Sea! IV Oh, what are flowers or ferns or blue-waved rills Or ornate valleys haunted by the bee Beside thy flowerless gulfs and foam-flecked hills, O Sea! V Thou art eternal as the human race;— Ere fair earth heard one lover's passionate plea Thou and the lonely sun stood face to face, O Sea! VI Thou sawest pale Cleopatra's galleys ride Upon the blood-splashed deep;—beheld'st when we, Conquerors, saw Nelson kiss death's lips for bride, O Sea! VII At Marathon thou watched'st the fierce hosts Collide in battle:—far from rose or tree, Thou communest with the pale stars' glimmering ghosts, O Sea! VIII Hear us! Oh pour upon us thy great might, And clothe us round with thine eternity, And set upon our brows thy deathless light, O Sea! A DEDICATION TO MY FRIEND DR. N. D. GADDY, OF LOVETT, INDIANA Friend in the younger England far away,— The great free land beneath whose boundless skies Singers as large of spirit shall arise When its dawn broadens to a golden day;— Friend who didst travel o'er the sea-wastes grey That guard us,—eager with recipient eyes Once to behold the land whose heart supplies The hearts that rule the peoples who obey:— Friend, whom once seeing I shall not forget, Take, if thou wilt, these songs of English seas,— Full of the flower-breath of the English breeze And with salt English clustering spray-drops wet;— Take them: in memory that we once have met,— Once, here, at home,—beneath thy ancestral trees. SONNETS (1881) SONNET I THE FLOWER ASLEEP I stood within the old wood,—and all the past Swept through my spirit on wild storm-tossed wings:— The past with all its pain and all its stings And small sour fruit and endless yearning vast. Upon white tides of woe my thought was cast, 'Mid shoals round which the hoarse sea-whisper rings: I was immersed in floods of former things, And my brow ached at strokes of passion's blast. And then I looked, and lo! a flower asleep,— The plant whose plumes I gathered long ago To mix them in a girl's locks soft and deep. Through seasons of fierce sun and months of snow, While I full many a maddening watch did keep, It had done nought but bloom, and fade and blow. SONNET II BEAUTY UNLOOKED FOR Not sweeter was the breast of Venus white, Or bloom of Helen, soft in Grecian air, Or outpoured glory of the coal-black hair That maddened Antony with fierce delight, Than beauty bursting forth to sudden sight Within our streets, and making fog-banks fair. Not all our London dreariest mists impair The glory of mist-piercing glances bright. One may meet Daphne or a Grecian maid By Thames, within some oak or beechen glade; One may find Psyche 'mid the wild streets' roar: Or, seeking not so pure and sweet a form, Clasp suddenly the breast of Venus warm Where silver ripples chime on English shore. SONNET III THE OLD VALLEY Ah! still the old waves upon the gold sand breaking And still the old windy cliff-side and the sky Unchanged from the old lost days when you and I Clasped in sweet dreams too sweet and soft for waking Wandered,—and watched the salt free sea-wind shaking The tufted heads of clover and of grass. Now what is left us, as towards death we pass? Sorrow, and flowerless days, and lone heart-aching! Ah! still the old valley,—and the fern leaves yonder And all the clustered grace of meadow-sweet. Doth never lightning traverse with red feet These green fair glades? Are the black wings of thunder Forbidden with hoarse rush the fronds to sunder, That all is changeless still though we shall ne'er, Unchanged, be there! SONNET IV “LOVE'S DESPAIR” Oh infinite delight when never more The white seas shine before us on the sand,— When at the touching of Death's calm sweet hand Colour forsakes the hills, and light the shore! Yes: then shall all life's wild fierce pain be o'er. Nought shall arouse us from our perfect sleep: At woman's touch no lingering pulse shall leap Nor at bright Summer's footstep at the door. Whom woman cannot rouse is more than dead. Death's infinite peace shall fall upon each soon: Then in the timeless land where star nor moon Glitters,—nor rose of white nor rose of red,— And where no woman's figure thrills the air, We shall find rest from love,—and love's despair. SONNET V THEE When I grow grey and men shall say to me, “What was the worth of living, truly told?— Lo! thou hast lived thy life out; thou art old; Thou hast gathered fruit from many a green-leafed tree, And kissed love's lips by many a summer sea, And twined soft hands in locks of shining gold:— But all thy days are dead days now, behold! Life passes onward,—what is life to thee?” Then will I answer,—as thy gracious eyes, Love, gleam upon me from dim far-off skies,— “Life had its endless deathless charm,—and still That charm weaves rapture round me at my will. Life has its glory:—for I have seen Thee; And roses,—and June sunsets,—and the sea.” SONNET VI “WHEN?” When shall they crown a poet?—they have twined Around the lordly brows of poets dead White lilies, dark-green bay-leaves, roses red,— And golden crowns and silver have designed For singers clustered in the years behind. But ah! the living lonely thorn-pierced head: Raindrops and dewdrops in the roses' stead Crown the tired forehead,—and the weary wind. When shall they crown a poet?—When his ears Are deaf for ever to the sound of praise. Then will the world's heart open to his lays And his sweet singing move men's souls to tears. Life brought him torment. Nobler death shall give The force to conquer, and the right to live. SONNET VII SILENT GIFTS Alone!—And yet some silent gifts are won. Even for the loneliest gaze the stars are fair, And sweet the voiceless heights of moonlit air Unfound of day, forgotten of the sun. But ah! the sadness,—to be known of none Save of the cold-lipped gruesome bride, Despair! Alone to battle and alone to bear; Ever alone,—till life and death be done. The poet hath the roses and the sky, But not the sympathy his spirit seeks. Is it a soul-delivering thing to lie Amid sea-poppies by grey winding creeks Or on the hills whereo'er the white mists fly,— Waiting the gold-winged word no woman speaks? SONNET VIII THE GREEK POET IN ENGLAND In England's air the poet-heart was born, And his young fancies 'mid the city's roar Ripened,—strange fruit of thought the dark streets bore. Yet light upon him of the world's first morn Was shed, and woods that heard Diana's horn And Grecian waves that flashed at Jason's oar Knew him. He steeped his soul in old-world lore, And met the modern gods with speechless scorn. England gave little love. She gave him flowers,— Such as her Northern meadows can supply: And just one moment's rest in first love's bowers; And glory of hill and sea and lake and sky: And lonely agonised heart-broken hours; Death's bitterness—then the mandate not to die. SONNET IX “THOU COULDST NOT WATCH WITH ME!” Thou couldst not watch with me!—The flowers are thine Soft in the valleys,—where the blue stream speeds By banks of osier and the bending reeds, And where the sunlit golden ripples shine. The foaming white salt sea-waves' crested line, And the blue-gentianed austere mountain-meads, And snow-fields whence thy traitor foot recedes, And the far dim laborious peaks,—are mine. O thou whose hazel eyes so pure and deep Should towards far splendid heights have led the way, Hadst thou no holy watch with me to keep? The dark is lessening, and the pale morn's grey Glimmers. O girl-heart, art thou still asleep? And girl-lips, have ye no sweet word to say? SONNET X “I LOVE THEE” I twine the silent mists within my hair And mark the morning from the mountain-peak, While round me the sonorous thunders speak And strange light quivers through the thin pure air. For thee, sweetheart, this valley-rose is fair,— Fair as thine own soft slothful recreant cheek; Thee the gay valley-sunshine loves to seek: Thou wouldst not the steep flowerless high paths dare. And yet I love thee! though thou art so far Away from me, I love thee, sweetheart mine! Far down the valley thy bright soul doth shine, Like a small radiant guiding helpful star Seen through these tangled black grim growths of pine To show where love and simple pleasures are. SONNET XI ONE NIGHT WITH THEE Oh for one night with thee! Shall not the hours Bring round revenge at last, and angry Fate Be slain by white hands nigh Love's golden gate? Shall we not plunge amid the night's dim bowers? Wilt thou not crown me with unheard-of flowers?— Lo! the night waxes onward: it grows late: Rise thou; then falter not, nor turn nor wait:— The freedom of the trackless dark is ours. Oh for one night with thee!—one awful night Amid the stillness of eternity: Once, if but once, to know supreme delight, Whatever else beyond the dawn may be: As starlit heaven grows barer and less bright To win all heaven's lost jewels, winning thee! SONNET XII VENUS INCARNATE Upon the old cliff thou stood'st with wondrous eyes Wherethrough the timeless soul of Venus shone; And I,—I knew myself thy bard alone Till very death turns faint of heart and dies. Thy soul was mingled with the pale-blue skies, And the far dark-blue waters were thy throne, And in thy tongue spake Venus' silver tone,— Robed wast thou, mortal, in immortal wise. So thou dost hold my soul for evermore, O Venus-lady, in thy tender hands Which held innumerable souls of yore And swayed the unsearchable and ancient lands,— Now clasping my soul where grey breakers roar And charge along the vapour-shrouded sands. SONNET XIII A PORTRAIT Full of child-thoughts, and glad at simple things,— Not versed in deep things;—well content to be In green woods or green meadows, or to see The painted butterfly spread sportive wings: Happy in all the joy the blue sky brings, And full of an unfathomed purity: Not clever, great, or learned,—but to me Fairer than jewelled queens to mighty kings:— Such is the child: a very simple flower,— Flaunting no petals flushed with garish red; Full ne'ertheless of her own quiet power, Serenely blossoming on her own calm bower, And flinging from her sunlit golden head Light that transfigures many a mortal hour. SONNET XIV THE SOUTHERN PASSION On England once flamed forth the deathless sun, For, once, a woman kissed me—not as ours, But with the sweetness of a thousand flowers Whose passionate souls caressed me, one by one. I seemed no longer where our dim streams run And where the leaves with ceaseless storms are wet:— The woman's long loose hair was black as jet; Its scent stayed with me when the kiss was done. The glory of Southern passion filled my mind, And pale seemed even Venus' locks of gold And poor and worthless by those black locks twined Over the brow some god had bent to mould. In England even not every mouth is cold: In England even the heart that seeks shall find. SONNET XV “SONG IS NOT DEAD” Shelley is dead, and Keats is dead,—and who Will take to-day the poet's harp and sing? Whose voice shall make the mountain-summits ring Or sound at night beneath the moonlit blue?— Great souls are dead. Must English song die too, Die out and perish,—while our sea-waves bring Still their same ceaseless chant, and ceaseless spring Robes the sweet English flower-filled vales anew? Ah! while one English rose blooms red at morn Still shall fresh English deathless song be born, Pure and untrammelled as the English skies: And while one English woman still is fair, Music shall sound upon the English air:— Song is not dead, till the last woman dies. SONNET XVI THE WORLD'S MARRIAGE MORN The world is young.—Her eyes are girlish still, And girlish calm on her white brows is set:— Her marriage midday rapture tarrieth yet Beyond that farthest faintly-outlined hill. Not for our keen desire or urgent will The world will wear her jewelled coronet; To plan that crown a thousand hearts have met; It mocks each single craftsman's noblest skill. We shall not see it. 'Mid the morning mist And 'mid the dewy morning grass we stand: The world's soft girlish mouth our mouths have kissed, And we have held her white unwedded hand:— But ah! the rich mature lips tarry long For other seasons, and another song. SONNET XVII “WHEN PASSION FAILS US” When passion fails us, and when Woman fails,— When we are weary of the roses' scent And not one song can bring our souls content, Yea, when the very flush on Love's cheek pales,— What help is left us then,—what hope avails? What pleasure tarrieth when Love's robes are rent Asunder, and his golden hours are spent, And the wind whistles round his house and wails? When even Woman's lips are no more red, And the sun ceases, and the silver moon Is tarnished, and the pleasant stars are dead, And sorrow murmurs through the bowers of June, Is there a Power to lift the weary head And turn life's darkness into golden noon? SONNET XVIII “IS THERE A HAND?” Is there a hand more tender than the hand Of Woman? Are there bountiful deep eyes Whence the eternal pity never flies? Is there a God within some deathless land? And can he bend and hear and understand From heights of awful unapproached clear skies? Is there a heart of love that never dies,— Sweet beyond wish, beyond our yearning grand?— O God of human hearts,—if God there be,— Blend thou thy great immortal soul with ours. We seek thee, as a river seeks the sea, Weary of all the old inland sun-smit bowers.— Absorb us, cleanse us, save us,—give us rest. Gather our stream-hearts to thine ocean-breast. SONNET XIX BALCOMBE FOREST O strange sequestered sunny silent land Where fairies exiled from man's haunts, might dwell! Land of the great fern and the heather-bell And larch and pine and beech-bole gnarled and grand And trout-streams brown and lanes of rufous sand And many a deep-green shrouded mystic dell And silver-gleaming lake and mossy fell,— Shall I again within thy borders stand?— Thou hast an inland splendour all thine own. And yet thy tenderest delight to me Was,—not thy soft and deep streams' silver tone, Nor yet the glory of heather-purpled lea,— But that one summit whence far hills were shown, Behind whose green walls lay the grey wild sea. SONNET XX BEYOND Beyond,—beyond the stifling inland nooks Well loved of flowers and birds and butterflies, And dim caerulean depths of summer skies, And pebbly plashing meadowsweet-lined brooks, Out to the far-off sea my spirit looks; And seeks with fiery passionate surmise The shore where the eternal sea-waves' eyes Watch their sea-birds,—as these trees watch their rooks. Beyond these valleys,—beautiful indeed,— Beyond these haunts of heron, hawk, and jay,— Beyond flower-sprinkled scented dappled mead,— Thou art; and thy dark hair is wet with spray, O my sea-bird: and all my soul would speed, Repressless, towards our waves and thee to-day! SONNET XXI ENGLAND England of Shakespeare, Shelley, Milton, Keats, Burns, Byron, Wordsworth,—hath thine head grown grey, And are the former glories passed away? Is the heart tired that 'neath thine armour beats? As year by year with speedy wing retreats, Doth thy strength dwindle slowly and decay? While yet the world basks in the golden day Is it mist of night that round about thee fleets?— Rise thou, O England! Let thy great limbs sleep No longer. Burn upon us with those eyes That blenched not at Trafalgar's blood-red skies,— Nor Waterloo,—nor Alma's thundering steep:— Let not this crowd of mockers round thee leap, While passionless thy giant sword-arm lies. SONNET XXII WATERLOO A stormy evening on a far-stretched plain Of meadow-land and corn-land,—and a host Of stubborn red-coats holding every post Against the interminable cannon-rain. Oh, to live through that deathless day again! The day when the Old Guard he trusted most, Napoleon,—found their world-wide fierce-lipped boast, Valid a thousand times, this one time vain. The blue long lines in motion, and the red Long line as steady as a wall of stone!— The Old Guard, plunging through that long day's dead, Swept like the mad sea-surges shoreward blown Against the red calm ranks;—then with a groan Wavered,—and turned,—and the whole world's conquerors fled! SONNET XXIII FAIRY LAND I fell asleep, and dreamed of Fairy Land: Of cruel monsters with red savage eyes, And yellow snowdrops, and strange twilight skies. A blue-haired fairy took me by the hand And led me towards a Palace where a band Of fays, with locks like the pink fronds that rise Within the sea-waves, danced in gleesome wise: Then came the Fairy Queen with golden wand. She moved to meet me. When my eyes met hers, I felt along my veins a sudden thrill, As when the passionate young blood leaps and stirs. I woke: I lay upon a low sand-hill 'Mid gold sea-poppies and the gaunt grey furze. But that Queen's hazel glances haunt me still. SONNET XXIV STRONG, LIKE THE SEA If God be dead, and Man be left alone, And no immortal golden towers be fair, And nothing sweeter than earth's summer air Can ever by our yearning hearts be known;— If every altar now be overthrown, And the last mistiest hill-tops searched and bare Of Deity,—if Man's most urgent prayer Is just a seed-tuft tossed about and blown:— If this be so, yet let the lonely deep Of awful blue interminable sky Thrill to Man's kingly unbefriended cry: Let Man the secret of his own heart keep Sacred as ever;—let his lone soul be Strong like the lone winds and the lonelier sea. SONNET XXV NAPOLEON AT ST. HELENA No more the plains of Europe blushing red Beneath his foot;—nor Paris full of flame Of triumph,—ringing with the Conqueror's name,— And the Cæsarian laurel round his head. No more for him his countless armies led The countless armies of the world to tame, And necks of kings to bend to lowliest shame; No more wide moonlit acres of his dead. No more the black plumes of his Cuirassiers,— The Old Guard's white facings, and the breathless glee Of mingled battle, and the glittering tiers Of bayonets, and sword-sheen. Alone for thee, World-conqueror, shine this island's rocky spears, And that grey weaponless unconquered sea. SONNET XXVI THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW At last against the conquerors of the world Nature took arms and fought. The circling storm Was deadlier than the mêlée fierce and warm, And snow-shafts than fire-bolts against them hurled. Some sank beneath the drift and some slept curled In hollows, till the white cloud hid each form; Some staggered wildly onward arm in arm, With the tricoloured standards dank and furled. Napoleon gazed around,—and where were they, The helmets and great epaulettes of red, Whose sheen and flame through many a bloody day Had been his rapture? At his feet one dead Drummer lay stark. Then nought above, below, Save black heaven,—and the interminable snow. SONNET XXVII TO THE “UNKNOWABLE” GOD O God within the awful voiceless void,— God of the terrible and viewless night, God also of the burning midday light,— God, by whose hand the countless stars are buoyed, And all the golden sunrise-clouds deployed, And all the ridges of the sea made bright, And the far snow-fields limitlessly white,— God whom the green woods worship, overjoyed:— We cannot reach thee: yet can prayer make head Against the glittering tide of stars and suns And reach thy gracious central throne at once? Can our lone cry surmount the hill-tops red With fiery sunset? Can we find thee, Lord,— Or are our groans towards earless heights outpoured? SONNET XXVIII ISEULT Of all sweet forms within the enchanted air Of ancient legend, and of all sweet eyes, Thy form and glances ever the sweetest rise. To me thou art e'en than Guinevere more fair, And more bewitching thy deep blue-black hair Than gold wherein the heart of Lancelot lies: Thy gaze, full of the light of Irish skies, That woke love's rapture once, now wakes despair.— From Tristram's knightly harp until to-day All singers own thee. When the great seas broke Beside Tintagel, thy strong spirit spoke And thy shape mingled with the sea-mists grey That floated round me. Centuries pass away: Thou art fair as when beside thee Tristram woke. SONNET XXIX “A LITTLE WHILE” A little while, a little while,—and then, Ye roses and ye lilies all, farewell! Farewell, each valley and fragrant fern-soft dell: I shall not meet your tender gaze again. I pass for ever from the sight of men To lands wherein the souls of poets dwell: My foot may traverse many a moonlit fell; My soul may slumber in some star-proof glen. Farewell, ye English mountains! For the dead New mountains lift full many a lordly head. Farewell, sweet summer and wind-tossed wintry snow! Farewell, ye seas that on the old shores break! Keats' eyes may dawn upon me when I wake, And Shelley's risen soul my soul may know. SONNET XXX “WILT THOU COME?” Wilt thou come, love with the old grey-green eyes? Wilt thou pass with me to the land of death, And fill the vales with thy dear rose-soft breath, And fill the eternal heavens with sweet surprise As all thy beauty doth upon them rise?— Not since the death of Beatrice, so fair A woman, poet-crowned, upon that air Dawned,—adding splendour to the deathless skies. Wilt thou come with me, bursting every chain, And join within the land where death no more Sets evil footstep on the sunny shore The spirit whom through endless speechless pain Dante made his? Wilt thou be mine again, And let thy lips smile tenderly, as of yore? SONNET XXXI “IS IT WORTH WHILE?” Is it worth while to have breathed the earthly air?— Yes: even if the final end be near, And if pain's storms have clouded many a year, Yet there were early summers soft and fair. Passion hath twined for me full many a rare Chaplet,—and Harrow boyish skies were clear, And Oxford marigolds in marshy mere Shone radiant,—and the Cornish maiden-hair. And the great Northern waves did welcome me,— And, Alice, thou their Venus then wast born, Born from the eddies of the frothing sea, White-bodied as in the young world's sweet morn. It is worth while to have lived for thee,—for thee,— Though years on weary years have wailed forlorn. SONNET XXXII “THOUGH HALF MY HEART BE GREEK” Though half my heart be Greek, and Venus fill My soul with rapture of her face and wings, Yet this grey misty land my spirit sings Not less,—yea, every English green-browed hill And white-plumed golden-watered dancing rill:— Each daffodilly yellowing our springs Round me a robe of blossom-witchery flings; Each English rose of my soul hath her will. Our blossoms crown me, and our rain-dark skies Are dear,—and London, wherein I was born, Is more than Athens fervent with the morn:— Our turrets strike the clouds in statelier wise Than those that towards the cloudless blue air rise, Based on the blue seas of the Golden Horn. SONNET XXXIII THE ENGLISH RACE The English spirits round me are mine own.—. The Vikings' yearning is within my blood; The grey dim splendid endless ocean-flood Whose seething spray against my lips is thrown, Upward and shoreward by the salt winds blown, Is that whereon their white-sailed fierce ships stood:— And every tide hath laved our walls of wood, And every shore hath heard our cannons' tone. Though Greece be dear, yet am I of the race That held the blood-stained plain of Waterloo, Hour after hour, each soldier in his place, Till sunset slipped their tight-strained leash,—and who (One small ship's The Revenge. obstinate and dauntless crew) Looked the whole Spanish navy in the face. SONNET XXXIV MY LOVE But most of all my love is English-eyed And English-souled and English-hearted,—she Is one in spirit with our grey-eyed sea And unto its eternity allied, Song's ever-present ever-gracious Bride:— So will I till the end, O sweetheart, be English along with Ocean and with Thee,— Thine and the sea's in passion deep and wide. Gaze through me, Thou:—and thou, all-loving sea, Who hast borne our ships to victory East and West,— Who foldedst Shelley in thy blue soft breast, And who wilt from these white cliffs never flee, Give thou to her thy sweetness,—and to me Thy soul of music;—and to both thy rest. LILIES: THIRTY SONNETS I. THE GREAT WAVE For thy sake, sweet, I keep the great clear wave Silent and moveless,—still, within my heart. I help thee, love, to play thy daily part In patience, and through love the world to save. Our bright star glistens, bright beyond the grave, And here we have the silver voice of Art To cheer and gladden; and, to soothe each smart, Love,—stalwart, pure, indomitable, brave. I keep the great wave still: although 'tis there Ready, if even on earth a greater need Arise,—some wrong e'en Love were weak to bear. Till then I hold, for so hath Love decreed, The wave that might devour with fiercest spray, Still as the blue sea on a summer day. II. MY SWORD God says that I may send thee, sweet, my sword.— Its use is nearly over,—let the hilt Be held once in thy white hand if thou wilt;— That touch will be its owner's high reward. Black-stained it is with blood of foemen spilt, Dinted and jagged, and snapped anigh the point, And all the tassel is of rusted gilt; The scabbard gapes with wear at every joint. I shall not need it more. The highest gift That I can give, it is; the tenderest too. No more in battle shall it glitter swift, And, after, streak its sheath with crimson dew. The sword is dead and victor,—as am I: Take thou the weary steel, and put it by. III. “I AM TRISTRAM” I am Tristram watching how the young souls tilt.— I lean with thee, my dark-haired tourney-bride, Against this pillar,—press thee to my side, And sheathe my strong sword bloodied to the hilt. The stains of blood are dry thereon. Unspilt Shall be the red flood in this battle-tide:— No more my plume goes, swaying in its pride, Athwart the mêlée: hushed my battle-lilt. Sweet, watch with me the combatants,—nor ask Thy knightly Tristram to unsheathe his sword. To unhorse these youths were all too easy task: Their maidens' kisses are not my reward. Lo! I am Tristram. Iseult, share with me The swordless bloodless calm of victory. IV. BLOSSOMS ABOVE A TOMB For Beatrice a red rose, and a white For thee,—and for my wife a violet fair. Let petals of such flowers caress the air Above my grave, when summer suns shine bright.— Red for the day,—the snowy for the night,— The purple for the eve or early morn: By tender hands let such three plants be borne Towards the green hillock where in still delight The poet sleeps, life's mantle off him torn, Waiting the resurrection and its might. —Earth had for him not much besides its scorn: Love found his soul, then left that soul forlorn: But death hath rapture! Where in grievous plight He sowed, behold the interminable corn! V. ETERNAL MURMURINGS I hear the murmurs of the eternal sea That washes round the trembling shores of time; I mark faint whispers from another clime; Death's form at seasons overshadows me. But through it all I part not, sweet, from thee;— Rather our passion waxes more sublime As earthly sounds become like some spent rhyme; Our sacred love-flower blooms eternally. Oh, if thou diest the first, be ever near To lead me upward with love's whisper clear,— To draw me forth with passion's accent fond. When the last loving kiss on earth is given Just as I die, be thine the first in heaven: Before death others kiss; kiss thou beyond! VI. MY BELOVED Pain's fiery lesson was to teach us this: To teach the perfect truth to either soul,— That now, beside us as the swift months roll, Nought may disturb, no frailty mar, our bliss. Beneath the stars again our spirits kiss: Again the smarting puzzled hearts are whole: Again with gladdened lips Love's crystal bowl We touch;—and know how great a thing Love is. Heart of my heart, soul of my soul indeed, Wast thou in sorrow, and did I not bleed? Mind of my mind, were issues vast at stake, Bewildering thee,—and did not my mind ache? Spirit that crownest mine beyond all loss, Out of one tree God hewed for each a cross. VII. BEHIND Behind it all—the anger and the flame That leapt upon thee—there is, couldst thou see, The loving inner changeless soul of me, Unshaken,—clear for ever in its aim. I love thee,—and so I hate eternally Each smallness foreign to thy nature true: Just as I welcome every blossom new Of thought or heart; each growth of being's tree. Behind it all,—O thou whom I adore Enough to “crucify”—as thou didst say,— There is the love that changes never more; The soul of yearning thou canst never slay:— Strength that would help thee; prayer that intercedes; Sweet love that tarries patient: love that bleeds. VIII. “IT IS NOT ANGER” It is not anger; couldst thou see it so.— It is not anger,—but the intense desire That burns for ever in me like white fire At last thy soul—a spotless soul—to know. The inward awful inarticulate glow Of passion that, in measure, through my lyre Sounds,—that would lift thee high and ever higher Towards summits robed in majesty of snow. This, this it is that sometimes sternly speaks When thou art weak, and lingerest by the way. God's mountains are before us, and the spray Of ocean; tarry not by river-creeks:— It is not anger, couldst thou this thing prove,— But burning vast intolerable love. IX. BENEATH LOFTIER STARS Yes! now indeed we meet 'neath loftier stars. The high airs soothe us, and the silence deep Seems part of that eternal watch we keep: Now, nought our reunited passion mars. Like marvellous and fragrant summer sleep A sense of life steals over us, and brings New wondrous visions cradled on its wings: We stand, victorious, on a nobler steep! Before us spreads the wonderful wide view, With ocean in the distance, dim and blue,— And love, with white and soft plumes, everywhere: We breathe, with ecstasy beyond all speech, In this diviner mutual height we reach, The unknown immortal soul-caressing air. X. SOUL-PAIN To-day my heart is broken,—and I feel No rest in love, no recompence in song: The slow sick weary moments crawl along; Not one can answer my forlorn appeal. And thou art far away whose spirit strong Brings hope and light and comfort:—now these steal Away from me, a shivering ghostlike throng, And no sweet God would answer,—did I kneel. O heart, heart, heart,—that triest to understand,— Keep thou for ever from the genius-land, And mingle not with agony like mine! “A bay-wreathed poet” means a brow that drips With blood for ever. Kiss not thou my lips, Lest the eternal poet's-doom be thine. XI. “I NEED THEE” Again I say it! Do we need the air, The wind, the stars, the many-voicéd sea, And may I not avow my need of thee Who art to me the chiefest of things fair?— If some sad brooch is robbed of jewel rare That shone i' the centre, must it not complain? Not strive its gleaming emerald to regain?— When I am robbed, must I that robbery bear?— O diamond, emerald, star, sea, blossom, sun, Things sweet and things familiar all in one, I need thee,—and I choose to say my need, As to the sea might speak some floating weed: Or as a wanderer might desire a star, And sink,—if clouds the vision sweet should mar. XII. “YET I ENDURE” Yet independent, fearless, I endure.— I stand beneath God's night with lonely head And watch the stars like one already dead, Or one whom only death's white touch can cure. My footstep through the dark supremely sure Sounds. Lo! above the hills my dawn is red, And soon my fair last love-word will be said, And no more will soft lips of earth allure. Because I face the terror of the night Alone,—and let God's dark sing through my hair Unflinching, smiling as his arrows smite; Because in silence sorrow I can bear; Therefore it is that with divine delight I kiss thee coming all that woe to share. XIII. “LET US NEVER COMFORT EACH OTHER INTO SLEEP” Yet let us comfort. Comfort is a part Of that strong help which either spirit needs: It lifts, it soothes, it purifies each heart; God's touch is gentle, when the pierced soul bleeds. When anger fails, a softer speech succeeds Full often; the great victories are won By patience, and the everlasting deeds By everlasting tenderness are done, And out of love the angels' robes are spun, And sweetest pity in God's loom is woven, And he is crowned with mercy like a sun:— By bitter lightning trees in twain are cloven, But not the human heart: it bends alone To Love's voice; yieldeth to no other tone. XIV. THE AWAKING And if one falls asleep, through labour long, Why, what shall the divine awaking be? Surely no angry word; but some soft song Sung 'neath the casement,—as from summer tree The nightingales chant, loud and strenuously: Or as the thrushes, some wild day in spring, Hurl from dank copse to copse their stormy glee And make the wet surrounding meadows ring. If thou dost need awakening, I will bring My harp, and 'neath thy window sweep the chords, Or flutter o'er thy brow my vocal wing And gently lift thy tresses:—let the swords Of violent speech be snapped; and if I miss The morn and sleep on,—wake me by a kiss! XV. “SHALL I KNOW THEE?” Shall I know thee when thou art changed and glad? Or wilt thou, if thou diest, wander far From me thy poet towards some alien star, That I, in heaven, may even there be sad?— Will welcoming angels golden gates unbar And wilt thou traverse dreamlands in the sky? If that be so, 'tis then that I shall die, Finding how weak death's other arrows are. Or wilt thou be so changed that I shall gaze And know thee not, and seek in vain to mark Some far-off semblance of earth's tender ways? 'Twill hardly be so, though Fate's paths are dark But, if I know thee not, say, “Love, rejoice!” And I shall know the tremble in thy voice. XVI. MY GIFT I give thee sorrow, and I give thee pain: 'Tis all the troubled singer has to give! This, this is all my guerdon while I live,— And, now and then, the pleasure of a strain. Not more can I bestow while I remain On earth an outcast and a wayfarer, With all the night's harsh dewdrops in my hair;— This scant reward and piteous thou shalt gain. But after death there comes my time of pleasure When I may crown thee in more ample measure,— Fill up thy coronet with golden bars:— First friendship through the agony of earth; Then heaven and close-bound hearts that sing for mirth! First sorrow; then a crown of many stars! XVII. “BE GENTLE” Be gentle with me: for thou knowest not yet The utter need there is in me of love. Oh! though the poets' brows, bay-crowned above, Shine famously,—look close, their eyes are wet. The sorrow of all the earth God's hand has set Upon them for a wreath,—and in strange fashion To understand in soul earth's every passion: For this it is that earth is in their debt. What the slow heartless lover cannot feel, The poet feels for him; and tear-drops steal Adown his cheeks when others cannot sorrow. What wonder then if sometimes in his heart There is a yearning he cannot impart, And sweet would seem a night without a morrow! XVIII. A PICTURE I saw a picture of a soldier low Upon some grisly battle-field. Tall firs Above him smote the sky with rigid spurs; Death reigned: and silent blood was on the snow. A woman's form stood by him, and she held A wreath, and loth to give it, loth to go, She seemed,—and it might be the pure tears welled From her heart's depths. The picture did not show. O sweet one, be thou unto me as she! When I am lying dead upon life's snow, Black trees above, and spots of blood below, Come thou with the sweet song-wreath tenderly. If but thy loving face o'er me be bent At that still moment,—I shall be content. XIX. “WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WAS ‘FAR AWAY,’ I WAS DREAMING, ETC.” But is it any crime to love you so That I would have you sitting ever near, Ready to help my patient labour, dear, And all depression's fiends to overthrow? Is it a wrong that I would have you here To aid the lagging moments as they go And speed the silent hours with glances clear? Is love condemned, when love doth overflow? A little distance seems quite “far away,” Because my heart would have you close indeed. After clear sunshine e'en the moon looks grey And wretched,—and so urgent is my need That, since I cannot cry “For ever stay!” The smallest absence makes my spirit bleed. XX. “SOME DAY I WILL TELL YOU” Yes; tell me all. For every thought of thine Is unto me a flower I long to hold, And thy past life is as a cup of gold Brimming for me with sparkling joyous wine. Yes; tell me what thy sorrows were of old! Press deep thy thorn-crown! Make its red points mine! Wear thou my bays and buds of eglantine; Rob me, despoil me thou—sweet thief, be bold! For then it shall be well with us. I wear This wreath whose lingering blood-drops soil thine hair, Whose raven-black, unsoiled, I love to see: Thou takest flowers that thou dost need the more Because their gracious bloom came not before. Take thou my roses. Give thy thorns to me. XXI. ART NEEDS THEE Art needs thee, gentle lady. Where dost thou Yet tarry? Art is weeping through the night, And though above his head the stars are bright He needs thy hand to wreathe them round his brow. The sonnets wave white wings and to thee call: Imagination's hand is on the plough: Fancies arise like wreaths of mist and fall: Blossoms of thought before the soft breeze bow. But where dost thou abide, O soul of Art? What songs are soothing now thy world-worn heart? Pale Art is dying, lady, for thy kiss: Oh, wilt not thou arise and save by this? Sad Art is perishing for lack of thee; Oh, heal sad Art,—and doing so, save me! XXII. THE VEIL OF BLISS The veil of bliss that each casts over each Makes each alone, although within a crowd; Love spreads above us both his golden cloud, And lo! at once we are out of human reach, Listening to the eternal spirits' speech, With God's dear tender eyes above us bowed. Others we help; yet are we, sweet, allowed To wander sometimes on a lonely beach. The veil descends,—and lo! we are alone, Utterly lonely, utterly at peace. The sounds of common voices round us cease, For round us both God's veiling arms are thrown. Then, when the veil is lifted, we return To help the sad, and strengthen those that yearn. XXIII. FINALLY ALONE Yet must there come a final triumph-time When all the lower service is achieved; When all love passes into joy sublime,— Joy higher than our highest hopes conceived. Then shall we be alone. The utmost air Of heaven shall crown us, and our hearts shall sing With strange joy,—subtle, spirit-thrilling, fair: Above us both shall brood God's lonely wing. Then shall I, seeking blossoms, find but thee; Hear in thy voice the murmur of the sea: Find all sweet gifts and tender of the air Within thine heart,—for purest heaven is there:— And, yearning towards God's summer in deep skies, Verily find it!—deeper in thine eyes. XXIV. “THY MANY WEARY YEARS” Thy many weary years were not too long As preparation for the coming dower Of love,—God's own unsearchable white flower Which now thou hast; thou hast it in this song. The weary waiting years of tedious wrong Wrought in thee thine intenser passion-power, And now I loving sing beside thy bower,— Myself through equal suffering purged and strong. And so we meet. Thou art ready now to bear The burning love-god's passionate embrace:— Love, long from thee withheld, is doubly fair; Sweeter is love, and sweeter is thy face To love for thy lone hill-top's icy air And all thy patient running of life's race. XXV. THY LOVE-SERVICE Thou art like some sweet queen who gives her heart To zealous Psyche-service for a time, Till she shall gather wings and growth sublime And upwards towards the ancestral high heaven start. Mine endlessly, unceasingly, thou art, For I have kissed thee in some ancient clime And circled thee with immemorial rhyme; In truth our spirits never were apart. But now to this love-service thou art doomed, Though mine thou art in the inmost depth of things. Though round thee endless starless nights have gloomed, Lo! now at last the morning's golden wings. Behold, the trembling bud hath grandly bloomed:— Thou hast served servants. Thou shalt gladden kings! XXVI. THE PSYCHE-SERVICE This tender Psyche-service of thee, sweet, Brings thee the nearer. Whiter is thy heart, Purer thy being in its every part: Towards me thou comest now with bird-swift feet. Thou hast endured the labour and the heat; Rest now beneath the shadow of my Art! No longer, rose, thy straggling tendrils dart On all sides, searching for some soft retreat. My Art is unto thee thy God-sent bower And thou within it art the gracious rose, Its one presiding ever-present flower. Lo! Art above thee her green mantle throws: Wait,—tarry patient for one mortal hour; Then, ever safe within my arms repose. XXVII. THE WAVE-TOSSED VESSEL Sweet art thou, lady, rising from the deep Like Venus,—white star of the open sea, Heart of the spaces where the blue waves leap And toss tumultuous heads ecstatically: Rising as if from some enchanted sleep Like a pure sudden daybreak, love, on me, With hair in those sea-breezes floating free And eyes through which the sea-birds' glances peep. “Harbour of refuge” am I? O fair ship, Fair woman-vessel with love-moulded lip, Lo! through the ocean ploughing thy pure way, Thy black hair pearly with the reckless spray, Sweet with the breezes, splendid from the sea, As to thine harbour hurriest thou to me? XXVIII. NOW Because thou hast been “in the open,” now Shalt thou find all thine “harbour” safe and sweet. Enter therein, O love, with fearless feet: Lay up therein thy vessel's foam-swept prow! Peace and reward the approving gods allow; Soft shall thy rest be after burning heat Of summer,—glad the flowers in thy retreat. See! this fair rose I bind about thy brow. O lady,—“vessel” of mine now coming “home,” Bringing me richest treasures from the East, Thy thin stem cutting the receding foam,— Love waits, and spreads us a thrice-glorious feast. Thou art bright with sunsets over loneliest sea, And with those sighing sunsets crownest me. XXIX. “I AM NOT WORTHY” I am not worthy of thy worship, love!— There are within me hosts of passions yet Whose angry serried spear-ranks must be met: Fierce warriors whose keen swords against me move. Oh, we have talked in many a blossomy grove Of happiness,—but am I worthy thee? O love, love, love of mine,—if thou couldst see My whole grim life, wouldst thou that life approve? Oh, thou art white, and thou wouldst shrink away! The whitest thing about me is the red: Thy wings are golden,—mine are gaunt and grey; Sins black and endless beat about my head With flapping plumes and urgent lips that say, “Dark would thy soul be, had that soul not bled.” XXX. THE WHOLE Wouldst thou be with me, if thou knewest the whole? I cannot tell: my sins are black indeed,— And yet for every sin I've had to bleed, Till pale and bloodless is the exhausted soul. Would still thy woman's pity intercede, And still thy white hand linger in my own? Or should I find myself adrift, alone,— Like one shell in the Atlantic, or one weed? One thing there is, if sins of mine are large, Large is the ocean of my suffering too, And terribly wave-beaten all its marge: Round youth's proud helm wild darts of anguish flew; And thou mayest mark besides a broken targe, Which once a girl's slight arrow struck right through. TO A CHILD I O bright-eyed child whose laughter Rings down the lanes of May, Thou hast the whole hereafter Spread out for toil and play: The hours and flowers and bowers of the long summer day. II All life is yet before thee: The dawn is in the sky: The earliest gold hangs o'er thee And the first breezes fly; Not yet regret with jet strange threatening locks is nigh. III What blossoms wilt thou gather? For all are here to choose: Pale lilies, blue-bells, heather,— All kinds and varied hues,— For thee we see the lea its banks with bloom suffuse! IV Wilt thou be prince or poet? All paths are open now. Fate, though thou dost not know it, Will crown thy white broad brow With bays for lays, or sprays of love from myrtle bough:— V Just as thou wilt: the morning Gives thee the choice of each. Swift yet sufficient warning Thou hast:—thine arms may reach Delight of white and bright soft blossoms beyond speech. VI About thee still the beauty Of fresh-robed April clings. All May's and June's glad booty May added be to spring's, O child enisled in wild strange dreams of many things. VII The greatest of all glories Thou hast within thine hand. Thou knowest not where Love's store is, Nor yet dost understand How beams and gleams through dreams passion's enchanted land. VIII As thou advancest slowly Along the brightening way, Fair love, white-winged and holy, Will meet thee, on a day, And thou shalt bow and vow thine utmost heart away! IX The very flowers adore thee: They know so well indeed What flowery paths before thee To fragrant paths succeed, By hill and rill and mill and yellow-spotted mead. X When manhood comes, and passion Comes with it, all will be Spread out in splendid fashion, Untouched, in front of thee: Bright blue of hue and new will gleam the boundless sea. XI As if God just now, solely For thee, had made the world, Its grandeur will be wholly In front of thee unfurled. For thee each tree will be with Eden's dews impearled. XII The road thou art beginning This radiant dawn of May Hath treasures worth the winning, Though Death with quiver grey Hath power o'er flower and bower, when closes the long day. XIII Yet, ere the long day closes, What rapture may be won! What fragrance of soft roses Gathered as yet by none! What light of bright and white imperishable sun! XIV Ere the moon rises slowly Above the purple hill What pure delights and holy May all thy strong heart fill, If thou from now wilt vow to Love thine utmost will! XV Ere the night's gold stars greet thee And the deep-blue dim night, What joys may throng and meet thee With hands and bosoms white,— Thee found and bound and crowned of infinite delight! XVI What deeds of priceless daring Thy young heart may achieve! Forth on the long road faring From crimson morn till eve, High fame, no tame poor name, behind thee thou mayest leave! XVII By far-off lakes and rivers,— Through burning wastes of sand Where the hot mirage quivers,— In many a wild weird land,— At head of red outspread fierce warriors thou mayest stand! XVIII The furthest East may know thee And watch thy gleaming sword: The gladdened West may owe thee High thanks and proud reward: As leader thee the sea may honour, and as lord. XIX Or else the god Apollo May crown thine head with bays. Him thou mayest alway follow Through sweet and rosehung ways, And fill and thrill and still the world with sovereign lays. XX While others in their fashion Are seeking lesser things, With great imperious passion And strong unhindered wings The sun alone and throne of earth's high bay-crowned kings XXI Thou shalt seek. This it may be Lies, child, in front of thee. Eternal may thy day be; Thy voice as is the sea, Or tone and moan of blown green-grey wind-smitten tree. XXII The winds that round our meadows And iron cliff-sides beat; The evening's lengthening shadows; The hush of noon-tide heat; The song of throng of strong bright gold-haired ears of wheat; XXIII The glory of the morning; The mystic calm of night; The tides the loud shore scorning; The tender snowdrop white; The speech of beech, and each glad summer's blossoms bright; XXIV The beauty of all women; The beauty of soft skies; The blue-backed swallow skimming The pond; the dragon-flies; The green dim sheen half-seen that on the far hill lies; XXV The pulse of blood that quickens At the dense driving spray Of battle when it thickens And the blue sword-blades play And flash and crash and dash the hot shells every way; XXVI The pulse of love that trembles At a young girl's soft tone; Passion that ne'er dissembles But claims her for its own; The height and might and light of Love's imperial throne; XXVII The glory of life advancing With strength that knows no bound, From height to far height glancing, From green to rocky mound, Till where the air is fair and free God's rest is found;— XXVIII All this thou mayest succeed to, And fairer things than these, If thou wilt but give heed to Fate's whispers in the trees And be as free as the far fetterless grey seas. XXIX Thou hast thy country's glory Behind thee and before: Past ages grand and hoary; A new untraversed shore; Thou mayest the waste untraced inherit and explore. XXX Shall it be bright with flowers And fervent with the sun And full of love-sweet bowers Whereo'er green creepers run? Shall it be lit by fit high starry proud deeds done? XXXI The whole on thee dependeth: The future in thine hand Lies: ere the long road endeth Thine heart will understand Each place, and trace all ways and windings of the land. XXXII And at the far end waiteth For thee, child,—yes, for thee,— When strenuous toil abateth, The Bride thou canst not see: Her breast gives rest from quest and joy and agony. XXXIII Her hands are soft and tender; Her eyes are calm and deep; If thou wilt quite surrender, She'll soothe thee into sleep: No voice of joys, nor noise of men who wail and weep XXXIV Shall pierce thy perfect slumber:— As now thine eyelids close While visions without number Flit o'er thee, living rose, Most pure, secure, and sure shall be thy then repose. XXXV See that thy life be fairer Than most poor frail lives be: So shall that kiss be rarer That in the end for thee Waits,—when all men pass then,—and Death stays; only she. THE POET AND THE PESSIMIST Pessimist. The world grows dark.—The poet's heart is dreaming; But when he wakes from sleep, Will he not see proud War's red harvest gleaming Beneath white moons that weep? Will he not understand the bitter anguish Of all things here below? Will he not mark the flowers and green leaves languish, The sweet loves fade and go? Will he not learn that God dwells at a distance, Far past the reach of prayer? Will he not teach, and teach with stern insistence, That love is light as air? Poet. Nay, still, in spite of all, my faith grows stronger The more I live and see. I cannot reach God? God can take the longer Star-road and search out me. If woman's sometimes frail, she's oftener faithful. Although the dark air rings With many a threat and trembles at the wrathful Red lightning's jagged wings, I have the unchanged high faith that at the portal No man's foot yet hath trod Wait,—deathless, grand-eyed, loving and immortal,— Woman and God. TEN SONNETS (1881) I. THY SWEETNESS A sweetness not of flowers or suns or seas Broods o'er thee. Thou art mingled with the air Of summer: yet than summer sky more fair Thou art, and tenderer than June-soft breeze. Thy sweetness, love, is in the almond-trees And in the lilacs,—and the breath of spring Doth round about thee like a garment cling; Yet art thou sweeter, sweetest soul, than these. Thy sweetness meets me in the morning-tide, And as the breath of flowers it fills the noon And all the forest vistas far and wide And trackless spaces haunted of the moon. By day thou art my joy, and, when the night Folds wings around us, mine untold delight. II. “BECAUSE THOU HAST NOT FEARED” Because thou hast not feared the darts of men Flung forth against me in their feeble hate, But hast believed in me in spite of fate,— Yea, in thine heart, sweet, often and again Hast borne their poison-pointed arrows when Their anger-maddened ranks around the gate Of song surged foaming, fierce-tongued and elate,— Beholding in me love beyond their ken:— Because thou hast not shivered when the seas Brake hard against me, and the pettish spray Of hostile words leaped round from day to day, And evil arrows quivered in the breeze,— Therefore shalt thou for ever with me stand When love, not hate, crowns me in mine own land. III. THE VALLEY ROSES And have we left the roses far behind? Are never any flowers and soft green leaves Waiting to gladden us,—no golden sheaves Bright underneath the sun-warmed August wind? What shall we in the fierce strange journey find Of rapture, as our struggling step achieves Height after height, while every height deceives, Each seeming that dim mount for which we pined? Oh, far and fair the deep green valleys glow! The valleys that we left so long ago, Climbing we knew not whither with joined hands. But one white flower I carry with me thence,— Thine heart: more sweet than rosebud, more intense Than all the wild scents of the hot low lands. IV. LONELY SEASONS But there are lonely times when all the seas Seem stricken into mournful dreary grey, And no sunlight streams o'er the darkened day, And not one sign of music charms the breeze Or breaks the silence of the leaden trees, Nor are the clouds made glad by one moonray: We are not yet completely one; delay Wearies,—and lonely long weeks blight and freeze. Then life seems purposeless. My lyre rings hollow: I cease to track the footprints of Apollo, And every sunset's wings, once draped in gold, Hang damp and heavy o'er the lifeless woods, And windless are the waste drear solitudes Wherethrough once Love's embroidered sandal strolled. V. GLAD SEASONS But lo! thou comest like the sweet moonlight That turns the flashing waters into gold: Thou comest,—and the world is no more old, But young and glad, and robed in wedding white. The swift waves laugh with ever tuneful might; Amid the trees the enamoured breeze is bold; And all this just because thine hand I hold And watch with quiet eyes thine eyes most bright. The whole world changes, love, when thou art here! The thunderous dark oppressive huge clouds break: Fallen are the broken wings of vanquished fear: Blue now for grey ripples the sun-kissed lake: Deep shines the sky unflecked with mist and clear: The very birds sing louder for thy sake. VI. “NOT IN THESE SONGS OF THEE” Not in these songs of thee do I caress My lyre, and utter amorous melodies,— Singing love-songs beneath blue facile skies Unstricken of storm, unversed in passion's stress. Nay, rather would I thunder through my lyre And mix my song with the tumultuous storm, If so I might the sons of men inspire And with my soul their listening souls inform! For thou art great: no queen of amorous ditty, But sweet, divine, a woman full of pity That crowneth woman, and of woman's might:— Queen of the proud untouched impassioned soul: Therefore for thee shall songs in thunders roll And peals reverberant the far ether smite. VII. PERFECT UNION For nothing can true lovers' souls divide: Not distance, pain, nor solitude, nor strife, Nor all the fretting cares of daily life, Nor thundering seas, nor sunstruck deserts wide. Breathe but a wish for me: I'm at thy side! If I desire thee, lo! thou art “quite close” In spirit, shielding me from myriad foes; My guardian, and mine holy spirit-bride. So is it ever. We are never far One from the other: never say “Good-bye.” One blue arch reaches us of kindred sky; We both behold at night the self-same star;— Both struggle upward bravely towards the high Clear sphere where the eternal spirits are. VIII. WEARINESS Through seas of pain and surging storms of grief, O sweetheart, we pursue our weary way, Waiting till on life's hill-tops the new day Shines, gilding every blossom, every leaf. O comforter of mine, of helpers chief, More patient at love's mournful long delay Than I,—less angered at the cloud-wreaths grey,— Speak words of hope: the sails of dawn unreef! Lo! I am weary; weary unto death. Long is the struggle, and the night is long: Not yet upon the hills the morning's song Broods, nor the sweetness of the morning's breath. Still am I battling 'mid the tides of night: O sweet star-lady, grant me thy starlight! IX. FIRST, BATTLE; THEN, WOMAN And yet chief strength gives chiefest tenderness.— After the battle comes the calm of sleep Upon a woman's breast, and eyes that weep, And the superb and sorrowless caress. Oh, did not Christ, after the bitter stress Of unknown agony in the garden deep, Fruits of unknown, unearthly triumph reap,— When, death being over, love leant down to bless? First, battle; after, woman. First the swords That mingle in the sweltering close mêlée, And then the embrace yet closer that rewards Of one who watched from far the fierce fast fray. First, pitiless strife. Then woman who accords Gifts that blot out the blood-freaked dust-streaked day. X. AFTER BATTLE And, after battle, tenderer is the breeze, More bountiful the beauty of the night,— New stars within the abysmal blue shine bright, And balmier odours fill the forest-trees, And yet more silvery moonlight floods the seas, And woman's breast is more exceeding white: More heavenly is the touch of finger light, And more divine the most strange sense of ease. Oh, wind the wreath of battle round thy brow, Thou lover-warrior! Then shalt thou learn how The kiss of woman may be God's own calm Descending with a softness past all speech Thy blood-stained hopeless lifeless lips to reach; Sweeter than crown of gold, or wand of palm. AUGUST BLOSSOMS: SEVEN SONNETS (1882) SONNET I AUGUST BLOSSOMS These are late August blossoms. Spring's glad days Lie far behind us; early dreams have fled. Not for us flames the golden crocus-bed: No tender snowdrops lift their gentle gaze. Roses are round us still,—and lily-sprays Their fierce white fragrance on the warm airs shed; Not all the flowers of sunburnt fields are dead, Though dead is all the bloom that once was May's. Across the years, across the weary years, Alice, sweet early love, I look to thee, And, gazing through a gathering mist of tears, I watch the flower-crowned cliff, the sun-crowned sea: Robed in strange light, thy girlish form appears, And thine eyes draw and thine hand beckons me. SONNET II FIRST LOVE Hath anything been ever quite so fair As first love, though the lengthening years have brought Result of labour, red-ripe fruit of thought, And new glad summers full of fragrant air? The swift years pass us. Doth each swift year bear Our spirits nearer to the goals we sought? Though we have wrestled, suffered, toiled and fought, Doth any aureole rest upon our hair? The sweetest crown of all the crowns life brings Is just to feel love very close indeed: Love, the true God who lives within each creed And folds around the whole world guardian wings. As towards new hills and blossomless we speed It is not hope, 'tis memory that sings! SONNET III VENUS What do they tell thee of me,—that I sing Of white-armed Venus? that in English air I find alone the old Greek visions fair? That love-gifts towards the old dead gods I bring? Oh, thou art Venus! Linger ever there, Where the wind touches with light-kissing wing Thy beautiful brown unforgotten hair: Be thou the goddess of the world's first spring! Venus was goddess in the old sweet days, And through the sunlit foam of Grecian bays Shone radiant and divine her tender limbs. So thou art goddess of the days when I, Greek-souled and ardent, laughed to see the sky So blue, and sang to it with marriage-hymns. SONNET IV GOD'S MESSAGE And have they told thee that I've ceased to hold The faith in God,—that deadliest war I wage With creeds and Churches in this struggling age, And sing the future's song with lips made bold? Oh, by the sea, and by the sunset's gold, And by the summer fields of far-spread flowers, And by grey wintry rocks and soft green bowers By Nature's wealth unmeasured and untold, By all these things, I charge thee, have no fear!— Is God the less a strong God unto me Because my soul would have him very near, And would be crowned with wild air of the sea— Would in no stifling church his message hear, But where his stars shine and his winds are free? SONNET V OMNIPRESENT LOVE Though thou art bound, and canst not love me now Save only in spirit, can they stay my song? Can it not find thee when night-hours are long And print a far-off soft kiss on thy brow? Can it not lurk within the hazel bough? Can it not shine amid the starry throng? Fulfil thy life's task: be thou glad and strong: But this true homage further and allow! Art thou asleep, love? Then my soul is there, Watching. Dost thou the wakeful moments count? Then am I with thee. At this crystal fount My song speaks to thee from the maiden-hair. I am in this blue gentian on the mount: I am around, and over,—and everywhere. SONNET VI NATURE'S MESSENGERS Birds, flowers, and foliage of the summer days And skies above us lordly and serene And forests measureless and deep and green And blue glad billows bounding through the bays And hyacinths and honeysuckle-sprays And roses that against the window lean Take ye my song, and bear it to my queen: Teach her to understand my love and lays! As the past lengthens, far intenser grow All noble love and passion. Love that fades Was never love. Now the tall tree-tops throw A longer shadow down the silent glades But sunset soon will gild their colonnades: Long love and passion must grow golden so. SONNET VII ALONE The world is waxing old and grey for me. When I see roses now, I wonder why They are as red as ever,—why the sky Is still as blue as ever, and the sea. Some friends forsake us,—other loved ones die; Like dreams a thousand golden fancies flee: Love of the young years, is it so with thee? Yes? Then our lonely hearts are drawn more nigh. We are alive yet, and have work to do; Through stormy skies still climbs the unconquered sun. Brave hearts are faithful and strong souls are true To life, till death the nobler bride be won. Still every morning brings us labour new Nor at the sunset is our task quite done. THE CALM OF ART SONNET Nought breaks the high majestic calm of Art: Not storm, nor shipwreck, nor the angry sea, Nor clouds wherethrough the thunders charge and flee, Nor sounds whereat the stricken nations start.— Art sits within her temple, sorrow-free, Unmoved and silent. When mad armies march, Her soft eyes watch the far-stretched rainbow arch Or tuft of furze coquetting with the bee. All these things move her not.—Yet can she wake, Alive and breathless, all her heart on fire, Her swift hand seeking her forgotten lyre: Alice! one word of thine hath power to make Art's sweet lips tremble,—as the unruffled lake Breaks into ripples at the wind's desire. 1882. “FAIR-EYED FRANCE” SONNET As Victor Hugo gazed upon the sea And knew that o'er those leaping waves there lay The land his spirit worshipped day by day, Dreaming of hopes and joys that might not be, So, lady sweet, I lift my gaze to thee Across the tides of life whose white-waved line Surges. Far-off thy laughing same eyes shine: The same, but far-off,—and I am not free. I am an exile. Thou art fair-eyed France Gleaming and beckoning across the foam. To thy bright shore what ship shall take me home? When shall I touch the lips who love the glance?— I ask: in vain. No answer sounds along The waves,—save the faint echo of my song. 1882. FOUR SONNETS (1883) SONNET I THE WRESTLE I sometimes think that whoso loveth thee Must wrestle with the stormy Infinite As Jacob wrestled with the awful might Of God, until his flesh failed visibly. For lo! before me stretches such a sea Of pain and labour where the billows white Float on a background of terrific night That my heart shudders often, woe is me!— Dread are the barriers looming on the road. Strange wastes before me trackless and untrod Where never star hath shone nor blossom glowed Stretch. These my feet must traverse, sorrow-shod.— Red is the harvest whose white seed Love sowed. Who would love thee must measure strength with God. SONNET II “MAN IS NOT MOCKED” “God is not mocked!”—Nor is the fiery heart Of man mocked either. Man can love as well. Man too can face the iron winds of hell And face the fires of hell, and do his part. Along the soul of man vast love-throbs dart, And through man's soul the great love-surges swell; And man can climb barefoot the lonely fell And reach the summits whence the thunders start. I stood where billows upon billows rocked And where the fountains of strong love began And where the arrows of red lightnings flocked Innumerable. Strange lips blood-flecked and wan Thundered above that storm, “God is not mocked,— Nor is the stormy faithful heart of man.” SONNET III GOD, MAN, WOMAN Yes, God is faithful. Man is faithful too. And is not woman faithful?—Shall she be The one thing faithless in this Trinity? Can she who gathers beauty as the blue Gathers the clouds, be the one thing untrue? If God with might of all the faithful sea Be stedfast, and if man be true as he, Can woman fail the Leaders to pursue? If man will follow God, will she not deign To follow man, though all the bitter way By their abiding blood-drops be made plain? If man and God will guide, will she obey? If God and man be faithful to their pain, Will she be true to love,—aye, even as they? SONNET IV THE VICTORY A spirit wrestled through the lonely night With God,—until the cold grey dawn shone clear.— But neither won. They closed again in sheer Ecstatic struggle when the sun took flight. Through the long hours with alternating might They wrestled, till the pale stars shook with fear, And even the morning's clarion in man's ear Doubted to ring,—so mastering was the sight. But when the sun was up, the strife was o'er. For once the human spirit had prevailed And Jacob was avenged for evermore.— Strong human love the Godhead had assailed And conquered. Man and God met eye to eye, And man's was the stupendous victory. THE LONELY GOD-KING SONNET The strange relief to God when he at last Touches the walls of empery supreme! When no stars glitter through a golden dream But God thanks God that he has made the past. The giant rest to God when through the vast No more white clouds with wings unearthly gleam: When no more moons or suns or comets stream Before his gaze half loving, half aghast. To touch the walls of his own empire:—Rest Eternal to the heart that moulded all. To sleep at last within his golden hall, Pillowed on some divinely loving breast: To cease for ever from his dateless quest, With heaven's effulgence round him like a wall. 1883. THORNS AND THE ROSE They celebrate the birth of grief's pale King to-morrow And crown him with their crown of immemorial sorrow, Their brown keen points of thorn. They sing, “To us to-day within the city of David A holy soul is given whereby the world is savéd: To us a child is born!” I look back, and I think of summer upon the ocean And long cream-crested lines of gentle waves in motion And limbs of white repose Rising therefrom: of Love the very world's creator Born at the dawn of things, crowned even by souls who hate her,— Crowned not with thorn-points,—with the illimitable rose. Christmas Eve, 1882</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. IV LOVE-LYRICS (1882) FOR EVER AND EVERMORE I The woods are no less rich for all the flowers within them, But richer, richer far: The pine-leaves stoop above the daisies and would win them; They kiss each white small star. II The world is no less rich for all the songs within it, But far more heavenly-sweet. No nightingale can hush the happy homely linnet; God hears its soft “tweet, tweet.” III The skies are no less blue because the gold stars fill them; Nor are the hills less bright When wings on wings of breeze on breeze caress and thrill them With lavish love and light. IV The shores are no less glad when breaker after breaker With soft light laugh of glee Charges along the sand and fills gold acre on acre With foam-pearls from the sea. V And so the heart of man is nobler for caresses That fashion life anew. What lightens with young joy the solemn pine's dark tresses? The clear sky glistening through. VI The more the spirit loves, the richer is the spirit,— So self-love crawls not in. When we win one sweet love, that moment our souls merit Another love to win! VII Star elboweth star throughout the blue fields without number Wherethrough their cohorts wheel: And eyes on eyes pervade our hearts and thrill our slumber, And lips on lips appeal! VIII Roses on roses redden leagues on leagues sweet-smelling; Foam-bells on foam-bells shine: And in God's world are women sweet beyond all telling; Lips countless and divine. IX More than the stars are they in number, and far sweeter Than fields the May-winds tread: Beyond the praise of bard's most passionate honeyed metre And all words Love has said. X Like hosts on hosts of angels wait they at the portal Of life: we never know What glance sent straight from heaven, impassioned and immortal, A new day's light will show. XI Beyond all dreams are they in beauty and in number: The tired heart sinks to sleep,— But through the golden aisles and marble courts of slumber Flash glances new and deep. XII If thou dost gather a rose, there will be still carnations By next day's garden-beds! Thou hast won a love? Yet new loves bring thee sweet oblations. New stars exalt bright heads. XIII New, new, and ever new. Oh God, I faint for pleasure, And worship and adore. Love beyond love, and lips on lips, and treasure on treasure, For ever and evermore! Sept. 23, 1882. A GIFT OF SPRING I For all thy youth given up to me so worn and weary, For thy soft days of Spring given up to Winter dreary, What shall I, love, return? What do the black pines give to the roses in the thicket? What doth the searcher say as swift he stoops to pick it To the first budding fern? II Thou art so young and sweet,—and all is still before thee: The whole long summer day's unbroken blue beams o'er thee; But as for me, for me, My summer days are far behind yon range of mountains; For thee the light of morn still lingers in fresh fountains; My face is set towards nightfall and the sea. III Thou mightst have had so much,—and I can give so little! Just a stray song or two to spread soft wings and settle Within thy braided hair: Young was I never, and now I am the dark grave's suitor; Least fitted of all bards to be sweet Beauty's tutor; And thou,—thou art so fair. IV And dost thou care for me,—and wilt thou swiftly follow My steps from dreary mount to drearier murky hollow Just out of love for me? Why thou mightst, with that face, have all the world in bondage! Wilt thou, the daughter of Spring, bind thy bright brow with frondage Autumnal, such as I can give to thee! V The laughter of the Spring is in thine eyes, and round thee! The crocus-spirit I found, O true love, when I found thee,— And all the daffodils Flash forth for thee along the meadows, and the thrushes Sing out for thee among the newly blossomed bushes And newly robed green hills. VI And I will never take thy flower-help without saying How in mine elder years I went one morn a-Maying (To gather thorns, I thought!) And found thee,—sweeter than the bloom of all the May-trees And whiter than flower-clouds upon the gayest of gay trees; Found thee, so far beyond the gifts I sought. VII If I can give thee little, yet what I have I bring thee. Thou hast given me honey of love,—and I, I can but sing thee; Yet sing I must and may. Thou hast made the face of Spring in late and dark September Smile: thou hast made a flame leap up from a grey ember: Thou hast gilded a dark day. VIII The azure of thy youth,—this thou hast taken and brought me; With thine own bloom within thy sweet hands thou hast sought me; My youth again returns: Again I stand knee-high in clover and wild grasses And drink deep in my lungs the sea-wind as it passes, While round my head the golden midday burns. Sept. 27, 1882. AUTUMN MESSAGES I The flowers that as they fade fling parting kisses tender From valley and hill and lea Towards Autumn, know that Spring will mark fresh blossoms' splendour; But when Spring comes, love, I shall not have thee. II The blue waves now along September gold shores gleaming Will change to an angry sea; But when the next Spring's ocean smiles, with eyes love-dreaming, It will not smile on thee. III Thou art gone! thou art gone! thou art gone!—And I, I may not follow! When with swift wings and glee Returns to England's shores the now-departing swallow, God will not let my heart return to thee. IV Of all the autumn words methinks this is the saddest: To know that love must flee; That one more love of mine, most sweet though it be the maddest, Hath no more part in me. V The blossoms die. But then the new Spring brings their beauty Again for our eyes to see: But when love falls stricken down by Time, his helpless booty, What blooms again? Oh, love, no flower of thee! VI The swift years pass. But then new years bring tidings sweeter, Delights undreamed,—and we Sing to the Spring's soft lips and hasten fast to meet her; But ah!—not to meet thee. VII To-day I feel as if my years of labour and singing Were fruitless as the sea. No song is worth its pang, no gift is worth the bringing; For all my songs will never bring back thee. VIII Not all the songs of Spring, nor Spring's own song, the fairest Of all the songs that be, Shall ever ring the same,—since thou no longer carest That I should care for thee! Sept. 27, 1882. THE RIVER AND THE SEA I Yes; sweet it was. Most sweet to watch your Spanish glances Rove o'er the Stage, and through the gauzy mazy dances: And yet how little part Can I have ever in thee! Thou art the Morning's daughter! Thy laugh is as the sound of silver running water! How little art thou akin to my worn heart! II I love thee. Yes. But as the night might love the morrow; Or as the spirit of joy might be beloved of sorrow, So art thou loved of me! Or as an inland stream that glances 'neath the bushes, All fenced about with flowers and grass and scented rushes, Might win the homage of the weary sea. III We have met and we shall part. Deep through my soul I know it.— And half I would retard, and half would not forego it, The moment sure to come When thou wilt pass away, and leave the sun's rays duller And the blue sea less blue,—the sunset dimmed of colour,— And every flower (for me) less full of bloom. IV We have met and we shall part. And thou wilt sorrow a little: But ah! how the thin stalk of love is frail and brittle In a young girl's white hands! A poet's doom it is that even his lightest giving Hath something in it of soul that ends not with his living But follows him beyond the sunlit lands. V I go towards that strange night that knows not dawn nor waking: But as for thee thine eyes are on the morning breaking O'er vale and wood and hill. Mine eyes are on the dark; my feet are seaward beckoned: Thy days and hours by days and hours of joy are reckoned, And of God's future thou wilt drink thy fill. VI And yet from all my heart I thank God that I met thee! My very soul must change before I can forget thee, Or thy deep Spanish eyes. Oh, never doth the sea forget the rills which slaking Its infinite wide thirst allay its endless aching And bring it news of far-off flowers and skies. VII If I can help thee, well. I would not pain nor hurt thee: Win thy soft river-love, to wound thee and desert thee. Nay, never let it be That one soft silver stream, one white-foot mountain's daughter, Trusted with simple trust the limitless grey water, Yet found no answering stern faith in the sea! VIII I am the sea,—to thee. Thou art the bright-foot river Darting amid the reeds with tender pulse and shiver Of guardian aspen-stems. Thou hast had one glimpse,—just one,—of life beyond thy dreaming: Of the far treeless waste illimitably gleaming, Crowned with the cold stars' scentless diadems. IX Thou hast given me life quite new. I, in the world no stranger, Long versed in love and song, and passion's charm and danger, To thee am unknown quite: Therein for me doth lurk the subtle joy and gladness; I bid farewell to grief, I laugh at mist-wreathed sadness, And simply bask in thine eyes' sunny light. X I might have been re-born the other night when sitting Close by thy side I watched the fairy figures flitting Across the magic stage. I was no more myself, but twenty summers younger. And all that night the stars seemed lightened of their hunger, And my heart lightened of the hunger of age. XI Ah! when I seek alone the shadowy water glooming On my last night of all, and all life's deeds are looming Large in the unearthly light That then gleams over and round about me, may I, meeting The sea's full glance of strong inquiring love and greeting, Feel that I left thee, as I found thee, white. XII I perhaps have made an hour or two for thee pass quicker, And made thy lamp of life more brightly flame and flicker Just for a little space: I have not given thee pain. And thou hast given a poet Joy for a month or two, and pain that will outgrow it, And the eternal memory of thy face. Oct. 2, 1882. SONGS OF NIGHT TO MORNING I. AT THE THEATRE Thine eyes are set upon the dancing-girls before thee: I only gaze at thee. Then far beyond and o'er thee My soul-gaze travels far. I see the moment when thou wilt be crowned with roses And violets of young love, just when my journey closes Where flowerless sea-waves watch each flowerless star. This is the charm and yet the pang,—the gulf betwixt us. The sorceress, I trow, whose cunning cold hand mixed us The magic draught we drink Mixed in it honey and gall. For thee the flowing honey, So sweet and clear and fresh and bright and golden-sunny; For me the dark gall when the thick dregs sink. Thou gazest at the Stage. My fixed looks travel theeward. Just as a swimmer who makes strong gallant headway seaward Plunges within the breast Of some white warm soft wave, my whole soul in thy beauty Revels and plunges deep,—and clasps the peerless booty, And in its loveliness finds perfect rest. Thou art glad at the lights and music. I am gladder At thee than at all lights and music, and a madder And wilder tide doth dart Throughout my veins and nerves, through watching thee, than floweth Throughout the brain to which the strong red fierce wine goeth; Thou dost intoxicate both head and heart. II. AND YET And yet it seems to me that something of paternal Desire within my soul is guardian to thy vernal Sweet soft days full of leaf:— And that, if thou didst pass beyond my sight, and, sinning, Didst mar the fairy life that thou art now beginning, A sword would pierce me of eternal grief. There is a love that hath within it nought but passion. But there are souls who love in nobler sunnier fashion, With far more starlike will. There is a love that bends, with something of a mother Within its yearning deep, and somewhat of a brother, Above the heart wild love might wound or kill. Oh, if my doom is this,—that I must see thee turning From the true road, and know that even God's own yearning Could hardly stay thy feet;— If I am doomed to watch the girlish soft eyes harden, Just as a man who sees a rosebud in his garden Rusted and withered by the wind and sleet;— If I am doomed to watch the fairy brown bright glances That I have loved, God knows!—fling conscious cunning lances Against the shields of men;— If as thou growest in years thou hast to lose that tender And nameless charm that now with more than mortal splendour Doth clothe thy spirit often and again;— If I must see all this and feel the cold sword sinking Within my heart, yet bear in silence, without shrinking, The utmost keen deep pang; Yet may I know that I, according to my measure, Lifted and never sank thy white soul's priceless treasure, And loved thee purely, as I purely sang. May never a bud of thine through me be wind-tossed roughly! Thou art not made of harsh coarse clay, nor fashioned toughly As some thy sisters are: Thou wast not made to hear rude merriment and laughter; Surely thou hast before thee some divine hereafter; Grow starlike, having soft eyes like a star. No man can grow a woman as he groweth roses. Nay, God himself at times from the long task reposes, And weary he turns, and sighs. Thine own path thou must take.—And I thy swift-winged swallow May be forbidden for years thy summer laugh to follow And the dear summer sunshine in thine eyes. God's hand is over both.—Because I love thee dearly A pitiless sword may pierce my soul,—I see it clearly,— I know my risk full well. Yet were there a thousand swords in front, or blazing trenches, Mine would not be the eye or hand or heart that blenches,— If I could save thee just one shadow of hell. Oct. 5, 1882. III. “PERHAPS A DREAM IT IS” Perhaps a dream it is,—but far too sweet for breaking. Give me another month to dream on without waking, Or even another day! What are the sweetest things but dreams? What is the summer But just a gorgeous dream to every blossom-comer That laughs encircled in the clasp of May! The real nights are the nights when, golden, beyond number, Star-thoughts and starlike eyes pervade and haunt our slumber: The real days are the days When over and round about us sunny Love is gleaming:— False days and nights are those that have no heart for dreaming,— When no thoughts thrill our stormy souls to lays. IV. “THINK WHAT IT IS TO ME” Think what it is to me with life's black tempest blowing Still through my hair, and still the weary rain-drops flowing Adown my face and hands, To meet thee full of summer,—and full of morning sweetness! Think how it rounds my life to passionate completeness, And brings me visions of green laughing lands! And thou art linked to me,—for thou dost love the rivers, And the deep woods wherein the chequered sunlight quivers Through maze of leaf on leaf: And thy feet have not feared the pathways of the mountains, And thou hast caught the laugh of far-off silvery fountains; Thou hast kissed pleasure,—as I have kissed grief. Think what it is to me, after long years of bondage, Again with thee to see the light wind kiss the frondage And the free sunlight dance! Think what it is to be in the green woods embowered, And for a season short of risen life empowered To watch thy sweet face smile, thy dark eyes glance. My song,—I know it well,—hath death's wild wail within it; It is not all a chant of lark or thrush or linnet; Strange sounds along it leap: It is not fit for thee: it is not bright or cheery; But full of moorland sound, and sound of storm, and eerie, And haunted by the moaning of the deep. Yet have I loved thee so that if I sang hereafter Never again, meseems one ripple of thy laughter Through this my song would ring: So I have poured my soul along the singing measure That something in it of thee the singer's deathless treasure May to the mortal notes, death-conquering, cling. Just as a man imprisoned for years in dungeon gloomy Plunges his every sense in rapture at the roomy First large sight of the sea, So I for years in chains and far from joy and daylight Hail,—as he hails the sea's divine expanse of grey light,— The chainless sight and touch and sound of thee. V. “AND SHALL I THEN COMPLAIN?” And shall I then complain if thou, the sea-wind meeting, Dost sigh for flowers and woods and the soft warm wind fleeting Along the forest-glades? I sitting close by thee am like the midnight olden Watching the young sun, full of gorgeous mirth and golden, Gild one by one the green groves' colonnades! Behind me stretch long leagues of weary desert marches: Before thee open out gay miles of forest-arches: Life is to thee quite new. I lived before the flood, and saw the ancient cities, And sang amid the white weird walls old strange love-ditties, And watched with young wide eyes the old cloudless blue. While thou dost yearn for life, and softly sighest after The thyme on river-banks, I yearn for the great laughter That through the lips of death Sallies. While thou dost pluck wherever bright green hill is The stems of hare-bells blue and sisterly white lilies, I pant to meet the far sea's flowerless breath. And yet thou art mine! thou art mine! Because my whole soul sorrows To think how little part in thy bright golden morrows Of sunny life have I: Because I have loved thee not with selfish soulless yearning, But with the sea's deep love, and with the sinless burning Passion of stars and hills, and of the sky: Because I have loved thee thus,—where'er thy pathway leadeth, As through the vales of flowers thy happy young foot speedeth, I follow; I follow amain: And when the darkness comes and other loves are failing, And, watching death's grim sea, thou feelest doubt assailing, Call thou for me. Thou shalt not call in vain. Then looking in my face it may be thou shalt, growing At last to larger life, behold the strong love glowing Within me, and shalt rise, And meet the sea's wide glance, triumphal, strong, and tearless, And my glance, and love's glance, soul-virginal and fearless, With equal kindred deep impassioned eyes. A PRAYER May the strong arms of God be ever round about thee! Yea, mayest thou feel the sense of summer sun throughout thee Pass, even on the gaslit boards! I can do nothing more. Lo! I can only love thee. But the great love of God around thee and above thee Can flow, and guard thee more than shields or swords. “To-night and every night”—so doth my deep strong yearning Float upward towards God's throne—“do thou, Lord God, with burning Impassioned fence of angels' wings Guard her and hold her safe: or guard her with my passion, Changed to a fiery sword of unexampled fashion! Change to an iron shield this heart that sings! “Make thou my soul so pure that prayer may find and reach her And with strong fervent mouth and might divine beseech her, If e'er her footsteps turn aside. Oh, let me be the voice of rivers and of mountains: Give thou my song the ring of old flower-bordered fountains: Let somewhat of me in her heart abide. “I have the love, but not the power to guard and shield her. Thou hast the power, O God. To thee then, God, I yield her:— To thee: but not to mortal man. Yet, this I ask,—this much: if thou must ever save her By gift of death, Lord God,—take this, the heart I gave her; Die not thou for her,—never,—for I can.” Oct. 15, 1882. “THE RIGHT TO DIE” To have the right to die!—Yes: it will come,—the pleasure Of drawing one long breath, sweet, deep, beyond all measure, Then at the head of the awful ranks With swords that spurn the sheath and light still left to charge in Triumphant right along great red death's river-margin Leaping, and by death's blood-besprinkled banks. Yes: weary are the delays. I know it. Pale with yearning All day the steady ranks held in their wild souls burning With fiery might at Waterloo: At last the sunset came. With one fierce leap gigantic The long red line advanced and broke like foam the frantic Defeated eddying lines of surging blue! And so it is with us. One day along our serried Calm lines where faces grim with life-long deep hopes buried Gleam pale and stern and set and still, Will ring from the lips of God the joyful awful order— “The time has come. Advance.” Death is the great rewarder To many a heart no gift of life could fill. Ah! God, through the June day of battle keep us steady, Though round about us foes innumerable eddy And wheel and charge and break and fly: Keep our stern souls yet waiting for the order ringing Along the ranks, the eternal gift of freedom bringing, And thy one deathless gift,—the right to die. Oct. 15, 1882. SUNRISE AND SUNSET I. SUNRISE. Ages and ages since my boyhood woke from slumber And all the hills grew bright And flowers no man can name, nor mortal heart can number, Gleamed in the gorgeous morning light. The sunrise shone around. And thou the spirit of morning, O sweet first love, wast there: And thou and I alone watched the green hills adorning Their fresh robes and their sun-kissed hair. The first sweet light of dawn fell o'er the ocean hollows And gilded the waves' way: And o'er the water danced and glanced the white sea-swallows, And our hearts were as winged as they. All things were then in front. Life's golden gateway glittered In the dawn's golden rays. Ah! one could never have dreamed that woodland paths were littered Ever with damp autumnal strays! I thought that I would sing thy beauty and thy glory, O far first love of mine! I knew not what snowfields, waste, trackless, sunless, hoary, Lay on the wild horizon-line! And now that I have sung, and thirteen years have fluttered Their weary wings away, Is there one soft look gained through all that I have uttered,— Hast thou one word of love to say? Have thirteen years of song no voices and no pinions To reach and cry to thee? Hast thou no yearning still for our old royal dominions Of deep-blue sky and bluer sea? Is love of nothing worth now that the love is longer And of more passionate might? Now that the mounting sun of riper age flames stronger, Are the old sun-kissed hills less bright? If I have crowned thy brow with leaves time may not wither For all his wayward will, Wilt thou not, once at least, for old love's sake turn hither, Thy singer's heart once more to thrill? Wilt thou not look this way, that once again the splendour Of morning over me May flash?—as ever it flashed when thou, first love, wast tender By the old ever-tender sea. Oct. 23, 1882. II. SUNSET Ah!—Here I stand and dream, and sunset's red dominions Burn, high before my sight. Who am I that my thought should stretch young eager pinions Towards the far golden morning-light? Between me and the past lie fields on fields of sorrow: Yet, brown-eyed maiden, thee I have to-day—and perhaps to-morrow,—and to-morrow,— And then the dark night, and the sea. Once more before my death, old dreams and thoughts romantic Have leaped up high again: And passion's wind with laugh half silver-sweet, half frantic, Has swept around the shores of pain. I weary with sad days and sick at heart with climbing Far past youth's sunlit dells Have sought anew for thee the old streams silver-chiming And sought for thee the haunted fells. Yes: I have found a love,—and yet a fair white sister In her, too, I have found. I felt my soul awake when my glad lips had kissed her, With more than common passion crowned. For ever it is the soul that gives all joy to passion:— The slightest gift is sweet If given in soulful holy virginal pure fashion; The red lips need not even meet. Beyond all love, the love that loves just for the pleasure Of giving love away: And this,—the love of God,—can never lose its treasure Nor see joy's rose wings turn to grey. Beyond all love the love that, full of deepest yearning, Can still that yearning deep, And wait,—though far within the great soul-fires are burning And through the soul wild longings leap. This is the love that wins. And though to mortal seeming It win not here at all; Though half its triumph seem to careless eyes mere dreaming, Mere dallying while life's blossoms fall; Yet still I say that this, the love of soul, prevaileth, And no love else at last: Is all afire with joy when every faint love paleth,— Wins, when all lesser loves are past. Oct. 23, 1882. A VINDICATION I I claim the eternal right to love,—without conditions. To crown thee with my love, and crown thee with love's visions, Though all men stand i' the way. Oh, is not Love enough? If in a golden carriage, Sweet, thou wast drawn along, towards a golden marriage, Could Love have more triumphant words to say? II I love thee with my soul. Heaven knows I love thee truly. Each time I see thy face, the tide of love flows newly Round laughing happier shores. Each time I see thine eyes, my soul bursts into gladness And every swift pulse throbs with passion's mirth and madness, And all the poethood within me adores. III What do I give? Why, love. And, if a prince besought thee And to his gilded house of regal pleasure brought thee, Could he do more than I? Is there in this wild world one great exceeding treasure That hath, like passionate love, nor bound nor mate nor measure, Spreading wide wings co-equal with the sky? IV Ah! marriage hath its gifts. It hath its pleasures waiting: Rich jewels and priceless robes,—and life behind a grating:— Rubies,—and prison-bars:— Bright emeralds, diamonds, pearls,—yet never love's free laughter:— Rank, wealth, and friends,—and deep heart-sickness following after:— Gay frescoed walls and ceilings,—not the stars. V Have others prayed to be so pure that prayer might aid thee? Have others at thy gate lest hostile spears invade thee Watched, night on night indeed? Who yearns as I have yearned? Who follows as I follow?— Has love no awful rights when all rights else ring hollow?— Is love not just the crown of Christ's own creed?— VI Who has seen thy soul but I? Who of the men who watch thee, O flower of mine, and from thy dainty stem would snatch thee, Wear,—tire,—then cast away— Which of them all has loved, or will love, as I love thee? Would bend for sacred hours, O fairy flower, above thee,— Yet leave thee smiling on thy parent spray? VII Nay, the soul knows the soul. Of all things sad and deadly To yield a woman back into life's loveless medley When once the souls have met Is just the deadliest and saddest and most grievous: The very stars cry out “For God's sake do not leave us!” When once Love's soul-kiss on their lips is set. VIII The deep soul sees the soul. A man knows when a woman, Beyond all laws and rules and tests and quibbles human, Belongs, through the great might Of his own fiery love all laws, save Love's, transcending, To him. He knows light love: and love which hath no ending. Love boundless gives infinity of right. IX Why should I give thee up? Why should I, the possessor Of thy sweet spirit and heart, yield up to any lesser And weaker lover than I These spotless priceless gifts,—in that I have no power To give thee more than love's imperishable flower And for thy sake to yearn and battle,—and die? X “No greater love is there than this,”—that love be willing To spend its very life, its sacred life-blood spilling Just for another's sake. No greater love hath woman than that a man be ready To stand before her door till death, a sentry steady; Lest any foe therein an entrance make. XI I stand before thy door. Never shall foeman enter Till fifty spears have made my guardian heart their centre Or targeted my brain. As long as thou dost need thy sentry, thou wilt find me: Were there an army in front, thou wouldst be safe behind me: Safe,—till they slew me:—and then God would remain. XII God then would take my shield, and on thy threshold standing Would carry on the strife. My own death notwithstanding, Thou wouldst be safe: for he With all the holy and loyal great manhood of a brother Unto the very death would wrestle with every other Till he restored thee, smiling, unto me. Nov. 2, 1882. ONE PRAYER I And now must I lose thee, O dark-eyed love, O darling? Will the bright eyes of Spring greet thrush and lark and starling, But shall I not greet thee? I will not sing again. What is the worth of singing When thus thy farewell voice around my path is ringing? Let the great silence deepen around me. II I will not sing again. For years and years I, early, When all the morning clouds were washed in gold and pearly, Have sung to the morning light,— And through the midday heat I still have sung, and followed The song-god till in gloom the purple meads were swallowed: And then the stars have heard me, through the night. III Summer has heard my song, and Winter too has listened, And the soft eyes of Spring have wept at times and glistened At some sad passionate strain: And flowers I've twined in the hair of Autumn round her flowing, And with red leaves of song have carpeted her going; But now,—love, love,—I shall not sing again! IV Pang follows upon pang, and spear on spear hath sought me. Never one day hath dawned but that day's hands have brought me New sorrow, untried grief: And now if I lose thee—ah God! if I must follow The old wild griefward track once more,—why let Apollo Henceforward flaunt his uncontested leaf! V In the far early Spring of life my lady faltered, And sweet youth's passionate hopes and ardent dreams were altered, But life was then so young! My work was yet to do. My lady must be lifted Towards a high throne of fame, and with my laurel gifted. Love had been cruel: still love must be sung. VI But now that years on years to songs on songs have hearkened: Now that the solemn path has narrowed in and darkened: Now that the flowers are gone: Now that my sunset through the forest black trees flashes And lights the grim fir-trunks already with red splashes,— How can the old light song-stream ripple on? VII O God! God! spare me this. I who not oft beseech thee Come now with this one prayer. Oh, let its passion reach thee! Not often do I ask. But now that, this once more, I have the silence broken, And from my very soul of souls have once more spoken, Is thy response, God, all too hard a task? VIII By all the pangs of years: by bright days turned to weeping: By the sad eyes of old far-off pale lost dreams sleeping: By all my love and pain: God, spare me this one pang. I, once too proud to implore thee, Do from my soul entreat that this cloud fall not o'er me! For, if it fall, I cannot sing again. IX The young have all their life in front. The days may darken; But still to May's glad birds their sorrowing hearts may hearken; Yea, still the May-flower blows For these. Bright loves in front wave hands and beckon onward. Through lanes festooned with green their pathway stretches sunward. They faint not at the death of the first rose. X But, when long years have done their dreary work and vanished,— When hopes that filled the soul have long been dead and banished,— When age hath set its mark Upon the spirit, and when all things have changed their fashion,— Then to love once again with manhood's stormy passion And lose,—this is to see the sun grow dark. XI God! spare me this. I have borne thy darts without a murmur: I mortal have endured immortal torture, firmer Than stern rock set at sea: Yet,—here I tremble. I own I dread the keen sword hanging, God, at thy side. I dread to hear thy scabbard clanging. God with the sword, deal graciously with me. XII Spare me this final pang.—I am no croaking raven Flying around thy towers with prayers perpetual,—craven And coward of heart and weak. So hear me when I come,—and let thy great heart soften In that I clamour not and ask not audience often. This once I look thee in the eyes and speak. Nov. 5, 1882. TWO SONNETS DEATH I. Death!—Shalt not thou reveal all things unseen, And teach me why the roses faded quite, And why a dawn that brake in golden light Over blue Isis and far meadows green Became so thunder-dark at noon, I ween!— Death!—Thou shalt teach me why my lady bright Fled with fleet steps till she was lost to sight,— And sweet things were as if they had not been. Death! Surely thou hast life within thy hands. Thou canst reveal the secret: thou canst pour (It may be) the old light along the shore: Thou canst disclose the numberless star-lands When daylight fadeth. Lo! beside thee stands My lost love, found,—and found for evermore. DEATH II. Yes: this is the great crown of life,— to know That death is nearer:—twelve years nearer me Than when the sunlight filled that Northern sea With glory infinite, and passion's glow Fell over the blue waters. Even so, Death, calm-browed God and Lord, I wait for thee: With those I love, Lord, I would also be; For one by one my loved ones, smiling, go. And I shall follow. I am nearer those Who have died and left me,—nearer every day. Soon I shall join the unspeakable repose Of mighty souls and true who have passed away. Straight from death's sea to-night the sea-wind blows: What touched my forehead?—Ah, the spray, the spray! April 9, 1882. A DEDICATION TO JOHN ALEXANDER BLENCOWE, MY OLDEST FRIEND Friend, when at Harrow twenty years ago, Long ere my passion coveted the bays, We wandered o'er the green hill's winding ways, Our young hearts full of boyhood's eager glow, We knew not what should be, nor sought to know:— Now, somewhat of life's lengthening shadow strays Across our path, and in the summer days The perfume-laden winds more sadly blow. But still the world is fair, though Harrow days Are gone from us for ever; though no more Will Isis break to silver at our oar Or Cornish moorland purple meet our gaze. Friend, let me give thee these my latest lays, Full of old dreams of many a far-off shore. UPON THE PIER AT NIGHT I. I watch the silent night fall o'er the sea.— Is this strange sombre mantle, Death, like thee? Doth this dim starless void Whence the faint breath of summer air floats meward Hold all the souls whose wings have travelled seaward By the awful deep decoyed? Where are the myriad souls who went before? Who watched the same seas break on the same shore,— Then trusted Death, and went? Sometimes an army on the golden beach Encamps, with hum of multitudinous speech; The next day, not one tent! The next day not one white-topped tent is seen: Only the white-topped billows, dark and green, And the dark threatening skies. The foot-prints of the host are on the shore, But the bright-armoured warriors mix no more;— No shouts, and no replies. Can there be room in the celestial fields For such a concourse of gay swords and shields? Would all the stars provide Home for the increasing countless hosts of these, Or all the untravelled dark-blue billowy seas Of heaven from side to side? Nor only human souls have gone. The flowers Have sent their delegates from woods and bowers To try the land of death: To bring back tidings whether sister-stems Within that land wave petalled diadems And mingle fragrant breath. Armies of blossoms past all mortal thought Since Eve amid their primal host was brought Have dared the fatal track: And of these blossoms not one single rose Breathes answer to our doubt. No hare-bell throws One faint blue petal back. The winds of night come scented from afar As though from worlds where deathless blossoms are: Sisters perhaps of these. But never flower from that far land returns:— No violet-messengers: no risen ferns: No flushed anemones. And yet the land where these dead blossoms meet Must surely be beyond all gardens sweet, Beyond all woodlands fair. The land whereto our loved ones, smiling, passed Cannot be lonely. Though the land be vast We shall be welcomed there. II. O over-crowded fields of starry death What message lingers in the sea's faint breath Of you to me to-night? Just like a blind man passing through a camp I guess an army round me by the tramp, Yet no forms loom in sight. The pulsing of the innumerable feet Of all the dead seems now mine ear to meet: This sombre sea and air Seem full of viewless hints and whispers strange, And cloud-girt hosts the watch-word interchange; Great shadowy plumes they bear. Ah! we shall join you. Ready or the reverse, With lips that bless or foaming mouths that curse, We shall be summoned,—each. Some from laborious days and some from rest: But all the unfailing and fatigueless quest Of equal Death shall reach. The woman waiting in the summer night With hair unfastened and a glimpse of white Bosom that pants for breath Sees a strange face against her window shining, Where those green helpful ivy-stalks are twining:— “No, not thy lover. Death!” What fingers steal around this girl's slim waist In the ball-room, and cannot be displaced,— Strong fingers, stiff and cold? Death's, the eternal partner's.—And he twists Around his fingers and remorseless wrists Reluctant locks of gold. III. Yes: all will pass.—The cities where we trod When youth was with us like a laughing god, Guarding our joyous track,— These all will pass, and leave no trace behind. The days when round our brows bright flowers were twined Pass,—and not one comes back. The old loves pass. With soft eyes full of tears They fill the autumnal gardens of the years Where the grey daisies grow; And their breath makes the gardens sweet as those Wherein their cheeks were once red like the rose, That now are like the snow. We see them pass. They stretch out pallid hands Towards ours from lanes and fields of many lands And far-off streets and ways. But when we kiss their lips, their touch is cold, And damp and clammy are the hands we hold, And dull the eyes they raise. They all are dead. Cold Death lays hand on each.— The bride within her chamber he can reach, And smite the glad bridegroom. He lusts for lips that man has never kissed: His fingers grip the dainty blue-veined wrist: He storms the bridal room. He climbs upon the fragrant bridal bed And lo! the bright lips hardly kissed are dead And death the ravisher Hath carried off the blossom as it lay To regions where the very sun is grey And chill the summer air. The cities that we loved shall perish too: The skies of Paris shall no more be blue; They shall be dark and dread;— Venice shall die: and all the seas that filled Her streets and at the touch of love-oars thrilled Shall wash around the dead. IV. Where is thy father? In the grave he lies,— And the keen worms are busy with his eyes, And his pale mistress, death, With scentless bloodless breast above him hangs, And lo! her lips are as a vampire's fangs And poisonous is her breath. He had his day and passed. And then the sun Was bright for thee, and thy day was begun And all the air was sweet: Soft loves flocked round thee, and the summer flamed, And thou wast young and strong and unashamed; Winged were thy passionate feet. Yet dost thou not remember, when thy breath (On some June night when all is still as death,— No murmur in the trees) Passes, caressing, through a woman's hair, That some day God will plant the black mould there, Or stray shells from the seas? That tossed about from wandering wave to wave The body thou wouldst give thy life to save May on the next night be? Hurled in its naked whiteness by white tides Against the unkissing grim cliff's iron sides,— Sport to the wanton sea. So it has been and shall be.—For the dead Now round and over us are poured and shed:— They fill the vital air. The rose is redder in this hedge to-day For Cleopatra's blood: the waves less grey That Shelley's soul is there. Thy little day shall pass,—and then the great New centuries shall roll in regal state Along their destined road. Art thou renowned? Yet see how small a mark Thy light hath made upon the eternal dark, The eternal fates' abode! Just like one foot-print on the desert sand Is one frail human life. Grey leagues expand In front, behind, around. There is the foot-print,—and the endless waste, And the cold stars interminably chaste Far up, and never a sound. V. No lover ever kissed the eternal blue Broad sky. No eyes of stars have e'er shone through A golden star-wife's eyes.— In lonely loveless silence through the waste Trackless abysses must their footsteps haste. Forlorn are all the skies. If we set forth from this our planet's rim And sailed the sky-sea to the farthest brim We should not find one fair Oasis-island thronged by human faces:— Vacant and eyeless are the abysmal spaces: No laugh thrills the blue air. No woman's silvery laughter rings along The far heights,—only the dull wind's bleak song: No children's shouts are heard. The gold stars have not found one single harp:— They swim the purple seas like golden carp, One dense and brainless herd. Death reigns through all the heights and all the deep, One lone interminable dreary sleep. The stars have golden wings— Yet oh how far more sweet one dear green glade On earth, wherein beneath tall pine-trees' shade A grey-eyed glad girl sings. Just earth we know, and love,—and nothing more. The far star-spaces are an unknown shore Whereon the unknown tides beat. Oh, let us love, and kiss, and hand in hand Upon our poor small homely planet stand:— A cottage-home is sweet. Our planet, though it be not first nor third Nor tenth in order, none the less hath heard Divine love-laughter sound. In its green vales the amorous myrtle grows, And red carnations, and the sovereign rose: Its nights are passion-crowned. Here live we, here we die. The gods have bent Above our planet's forests well content: Here they have dwelt of old. What gods dwell in the air? We know not these We know the nymphs of our own woodland trees And elves o' the purple wold. O earth, thou art our own! The stars shine far Above our heads: we know not what they are: Great gold grand dreary things. We love our earth because she is a bride For ever near us, seated at our side; She hath no hurtling wings! She hath a sunburnt bosom good to kiss: Sweet with the smell of corn and with the bliss Of countless summer flowers. We covet not a bride with breast more white; We know her beauty waits us every night In her deep-scented bowers. VI. The great dark sunders, and its curtains dread Are as the curtains of a bridal bed. What new love waits therein? What lips the flower-god's very hand has fashioned? What eyes like blue seas, fervid and impassioned? What strange delights to win? Ah! is the dark not lonely after all, But full of voices like a festive hall Where laughter rings around? Full of glad feet that thread gay marriage-dances And sweet with love's inexorable glances— Crowded, and full of sound? Are the great spirits we have dreamed of there? Is the next world's sun brighter for the hair Of Helen, and the grace Of countless women whom our souls have missed,— Who wander through the shades with lips unkissed And light the lonely place? Are women there from white strange Eastern halls Wherethrough the night-wind's sombre footstep falls But finds no sweethearts now? Are all Death's sweethearts in that far-off land? Myriads:—sweet eyes on eyes, soft hand on hand, Angelic brow on brow? September, 1882. A SPIRIT A spirit wandered through the earth, and found No rest from pain:— He longed to widen outward without bound Or check or chain! He longed to be as God,—with Godlike soul To dare and do; To touch some passionate and Godlike goal Untouched and new. He longed to bind around his brow the flowers Of all sweet songs And all the pleasures of soft moonlit hours, And sunlit throngs Of ardent dreams. One life was not enough: More he must know. Calm seas are sweet; but sweeter are the rough Great tides that grow! Blue waves are lovely; but the iron-grey Tumultuous tides That lash the granite of the deadly bay And smite its sides, These have a kinglier charm for kingly souls: The plunging seas When over them the North wind's chariot rolls Delight all these. And so all uncontent with sunlit lands This spirit must seek Rapture where tossing waves with grey salt hands Search many a creek. The laurel-crown that God upon white brow For ever wears, This he had envy of; and of the bow Apollo bears. Him nought but being God, or being part Of God, would e'er Content: for limitless was his wide heart, Like chainless air. And not one soul of woman could content Nor prison him. They held!—Then suddenly the walls were rent And, free of limb, He darted forth,—and o'er all history's bowers Would linger long: He touched fair Rosamond with lips like flowers And flowerlike song. And deep within the Scotch queen's ardent eyes He gazed, and deep Within the eyes of Helen; and his sighs Smote Venus' sleep. Yet he was not content:—is God content? Can ever he By whom all suns and clouds and storms are sent And all blue sea And all grey storm-struck waters, and all sweet Triumphant air Of summer when the breaths of roses meet And laughter rare Of tall white shining lilies rings around The garden's hem;— Can God who moulds and sends these things be bound By bonds of them? Is God who sways all far-off starry bowers With one content? Is his soul satiate with one planet's flowers And tired and spent? Nay! rather through wild maze of star on star God wanders long:— And so this spirit, fatigueless, wandered far, Crowned with his song. God twines his hand in the strange fiery hair Of stars unseen And robes him with unknown and virgin air:— This spirit hath been Along the unknown and awful road with God Where planets wait,— And he the sun's gold morning-path hath trod, And through the gate Of sunset hath he passed. Some singers long To be inspired By dead great poets, and to catch their song: But he desired To widen day by day and night by night His own soul far Beyond the reach of rays of previous light, Be it sun or star. Had others nobly sung? Then he would sing, But not as they: Not with another's,—with its own bright wing Athwart the spray The glimmering sea-bird glides: the English seas Are still the same As when, soft-tongued as the soft English breeze, Our Shelley came, And never hath the red rose dropped one tint Of perfect bloom For sorrow at death of Keats, or given one hint Of added gloom. No. New for singer new the morning shines Down hill and vale, And the red sunrise through the pillared pines Flames an All-hail! What was the past? Like God he would begin Creation now, And wind all leaves of love his heart might win Round untouched brow; And sweep into his stores all blossoms pale And blossoms bright; And sing as though he first of all cried “Hail, Thou first morn's light!” And sing as though the flowers of Eden shone Before his gaze, And Eve's white figure wandered through the wan Soft twilight ways— And sing as though four red lips never yet Had fastened fast:— For him the grass with dewy dawn was wet; There was no past. The golden future gleamed before his sight, And woman there, With pure eyes like the matchless morning light, But far more fair, Stood waiting,—and his being's task was still To follow through All lives her form, and mould her to his will With passion true. For he who knoweth woman knoweth God: Who knoweth a rose The inmost Holy of holies' floors hath trod And found repose. God in his heaven of heavens was restless till He fashioned her, And on her form put forth his utmost skill And tenderest care. But when he saw her stand alive and white, His great heart leapt With sudden joy: he marvelled at the sight,— And then he wept. For she was fairer than God's utmost dreams, Though these be fair: And still with the eternal magic gleams Her soft thick hair: And still her eyes have more than mortal power All hearts to draw, And still her lips are like a living flower, Full of sweet awe. In each new city of earth this spirit found A life new-born: With fillets of fresh flowers his head was crowned At every morn. Death he knew not of,—nor the thought of death: For soft lips made His heart eternal with their tender breath And loving aid. Each morning through the waves of being he Could plunge anew And bathe wide soul-limbs in the tameless sea,— And round him grew A host of recollections starry-eyed, Like living things Through leafage on a summer night descried With mothlike wings. So his life deepened, and became no more A thing of earth, But a tide rippling on some heavenly shore With silvery mirth. And he could widen into life divine With strange delight:— As when one leaves green larch and beech and pine And lilies white And flowers of all the valleys and the hills And maiden-hair And silvery tossing laughing reckless rills And mountain air And forests where the fairies dance in rings And smooth soft dales And trunks whereto the golden lichen clings And daisied vales: As when one leaves all these, and with divine Deep joy past speech Sees the long white unsearchable foam-line Fringe the far beach,— And, after, steering outward, hears the song Of the sea-breeze And thanks God for the absence of the throng Of stifling trees! Those close-branched choking trees and woods ashore: Yes, all their flowers Were never half so sweet as these dim hoar Waste foam-bell showers! The houseless plain receives us, and we sail For ever on, Till night at the first trembling kiss grows pale Of morning wan. Flower-scents to him were rapture, bringing dreams No word could tell:— Where for wild miles the gold furze-blossom gleams And its rich smell Fills all the air, he wandered, with delight Supreme: a rose By its mere scent could charm the summer night To strange repose; And the red honeysuckle 'mid its peers, That wafted him A scented lovely kiss, made sacred tears Rise and o'erbrim. And all the gods of every land shone real Before his gaze; Each nation's fairest dream and highest ideal He crowned with lays. White Venus lightly stepped our reeds between, And Pan was there, And all old goddesses, bright queen on queen, Living and fair. And for each soul,—yea, every living thing,— Justice he sought. Prometheus-like he stood before heaven's king And feared not aught. For every petal of each flower he claimed Justice entire, And for each pale heart stricken and ashamed, Each bud, each briar. He saw and said that till all souls are white And all at peace God's robes and hands are red and marred of might,— Till all sighs cease. For with creation God its king is one; And the king weeps At death of butterfly, and lapse of sun, And war's rank heaps: For this is greatness—not to miss the small, Beholding great Events and creatures,—but to hold them all, One equal Fate. So nothing can escape God's endless hand; No red sea-flower, Nor heart of man or woman, nor rent land, Nor ravished bower. August, 1882. MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS (1882) SONNET I TO THEE As the slow weary life-hours stroll along And I find nought of gladness, nought of rest, And win small pleasure from white softest breast, And smaller pleasure from the summer throng Of flowers whose early scent was sweet and strong,— I yearn the more to be again caressed By thee, at whose voice once my weary quest Was ended—dead at whose feet fell each wrong! The longer that the past behind us grows, The more we need each other. Life turns pale, And withering petals cluster on each rose, And through gold beech-leaves sounds the wind's wild wail, And what of pain may be in front who knows? Oh, stand thou stedfast by me. Never fail! SONNET II TO L. S. B. One breath of passion surging into song Hath far more worth than philosophic dreams. Why waste thine instrument on rugged themes, Or by the tuneless fountains tarry long? When thou art just thine own self, thou art strong, But weak when for thine own heart's sunny gleams Over and round thee the cold moonlight beams. To thine own self thou doest the deadliest wrong! If thou wouldst have thy soul's clear song abide Changeless and endless in the hearts of men, Sing thou of love,—never hath love-song died! Sing thou of passion,—and be deathless then! Sing of the sea's soul,—be thy soul as wide: Its chant shall echo back thy chant again. SONNET III CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE Ah! longest thou, grim obelisk beside Our eddying muddy Thames, for days of yore When by a sun-kissed smooth far other shore Thou watchedst the dim brown-sailed boats collide, Midmost the Nile's broad reptile-haunted tide, And heardest the strange desert monsters roar? What scenes thou hast marked! what galleys with gold oar And silken perfumed sail thou hast descried! And now thou art here, and round about thee flows The breathless life of London. Thou art torn From thine ancestral measureless repose: Us thou regardest with Egyptian scorn: What dateless dreams are in thine heart who knows? Dreams of the princes and the gods of morn. SONNET IV TO VICTOR HUGO Measureless spirit! In whom the winds unite Their viewless strength,—for whom the stars and seas Sing,—and the soft voice of the fragrant breeze Of summer, and the snow-storms wild and white; Through whom the human limitless delight Of passion trembles:—at whose kingly knees Love rests content, while evil quails and flees; Thy brow with God's own golden dawn is bright. All blood-stained terror, and pale sin, and crime, Thou viewest with equal, yet most burning, eyes:— Before thee open the blue folds of skies:— Thou canst outsing the stormiest surge of time,— Stand where the rocks and rolling thunders chime,— Yet through thy song the prayers of children rise. SONNET V ON READING “LES CONTEMPLATIONS” OF VICTOR HUGO First through the early ways of love made bright With tenderest blossoms, holding his strong hand I wandered. Airs of morning soft and bland Played round us; through the greenwood's dense delight Of tangled flowers and shrubs shone Venus white:— The silver-fringed small wavelets kissed the land; We mixed with many a laughing lover-band; The world was fair to touch and fair to sight. Then came a change. By many a river-steep We passed: the blossoms less abundant grew. Still the same gold stars watched above our sleep, And the same high interminable blue. At last before the poet who led and me Following, a grey waste gleamed:—Death and the sea. SONNET VI VICTOR HUGO'S RETURN TO FRANCE IN 1870 Yes: the same meadows,—the horizon clear,— The same tall poplars by the unchanged streams; For just one moment the pale exile dreams That sweet unchanged fair former France is here. But what is this that seizes eye and ear?— What is that far-off smoke,—those fiery gleams? A sound of shouts,—a sound of women's screams,— French soldiers, wild and blood-stained, fleeing in fear! This was his welcome. As his eager glance Shot forth, it met a mixed ill-omened throng,— Blue tunics flying before the Uhlans' lance; Red-trousered weary troops who limped along; This was the payment given by Fate and France For nineteen years of exile and of song. SONNET VII WORDSWORTH'S SONNETS ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT O one grey dead leaf in a poet's wreath! Is it this the sunlit mountains taught to thee, This? When the moon above the impurpled lea Soared, did her soft lips chant to thee of death? O gentlest of all bards who e'er drew breath, What were the whispers of the hollow sea? What were the hints of bird and flower and tree And stormy upland,—and of pathless heath? In this sole thing, O bard, thou hast been untrue To thine own soul,—nor only unto this; Untrue besides to Nature's kindly kiss Upon thy lips,—faithless to mountains blue And golden sunsets and the bright lakes' hue: False to the whole world's higher sympathies. SONNET VIII LOUIS BONAPARTE O one great stain upon the English race,— That when the third Napoleon's warriors slew Women and children (though at Waterloo His uncle's men looked strong men in the face!)— When Paris reeked with blood, and when the base Came to the front, and exiled were the few Heroic souls to love and freedom true— That then this man at our blind hearts found grace. That, when the soul through whom the century sings Found nought of help or refuge but the sea, And must for nineteen years an exile be, Guarded by lone stars and the tempest's wings, Our England's statesmen could so low descend As to call Louis Bonaparte a friend! SONNET IX THE TWENTIETH CENTURY When quiet meadows shine beneath the sun Of the grand twentieth century: when the race Lifts up towards cloudless heaven a tearless face: When the far hills we cannot climb are won, Strange prospects seen, and deeds undreamed of done: Look back,—look back,—ye dwellers in the land, To us who at the century's strong gates stand But pass them not—fast falling one by one!— We sang the future, though the past loomed dread Behind us: sang the morning though the night Had not yet opened full-fledged wings for flight; Born in the mid-strife of a century red, We sang the advent of a century white:— We sang the living,—knee-deep in the dead. SONNET X “IF EVER, ROUSED BY SOME INVADER'S TREAD” If ever, roused by some invader's tread, England awaketh from her centuries' sleep And findeth with a heart-thrill strange and deep That she must rise in earnest,—or fall dead; If ever alien hands our harvests reap, And our chalk roads are splashed with angry red, And village houses riddled with fierce lead,— While in the houses English women weep:— If ever this be so, what chance have we? Little: if our one friend who, ages long, Has hemmed us in with walls of billows strong Forsakes us,—lost through our own treachery. Little: if we have hushed the warning song Of pathless winds, and bridged the bridgeless sea. SONNET XI THE CITY OF THE DEAD In early youth how far that City seems!— When our friends die, they seem to pass away Into some land where all the airs are grey,— Some viewless region too remote for dreams Even,—where never sun of daylight gleams:— Our own steps loiter onward day by day; O'er many a dark-blue lake and sunny bay We sail; we kiss white hands on moonlit streams. We gather flowers: the City of the dead Is still remote. “Which is the fairest thing,” We say—“a red mouth, or this rose of red?” Along the May-bright lanes we laugh and sing. We turn a sudden corner:—Lo! the dread City before us,—in the sunsetting. SONNET XII ROSSETTI AND LONGFELLOW O great dead poet who thine English lyre With somewhat of the Italian charm didst sweep, Is thy sweet song thus early lulled to sleep? Hast thou too passed beyond our strong desire?— But yesterday the wild world paused to weep For Longfellow,—yet Spring new-clothed with fire Is flushing as of old green bank and briar, And through the perfumed woods the flowers' eyes peep. Ye both are gone. Ye leave the Spring behind; But, singers, is it summer where ye go? Do there the eternal golden blossoms blow That here just through one sunny May we find? Is new strange fragrance wafted on the wind? We ask, and doubt, and wonder,—but ye know. April 12, 1882. SONNET XIII ENGLAND AND ITALY Talk not to me of Italy!—Hast thou seen The fern-draped vales of Devon? Hast thou felt The sweetness of the morning through thee melt Within the moist dense tangled woods that screen Blue Derwentwater, stretching broad and green Along the mountain-margins, belt on belt? Hast thou through months of golden summer dwelt Where white Penzance basks, sunlit and serene?— Talk not to me of Italy!—In our clime Wonders undreamed of I will show to thee: Is not this black-tressed pine-forest sublime? Inhale (could Southern fragrance daintier be?) This slumbrous scent of meadow-sweet and thyme Mixed with the scent that comes up from the sea. SONNET XIV ART Art is a jealous mistress. Who will hold My lady in his arms, must serve her long: Yet must he follow her with footstep strong, And woo her fickle heart with pleading bold. If ever in fair arms he would enfold The goddess, he must quit the noisy throng And follow her the silent hills among,— Marking far off her gleaming locks of gold. A time shall come when by some lonely lake, Some mountain-tarn, she shall look round at him: And all the distant view shall seem to swim In passionate tears as he doth fully take My lady to his breast, and fully slake Years of forlorn desire and yearning grim. SONNET XV THE SONG-BRIDE God hath his sea-waves, and his flowers and trees: Think you that in God's eyes one single rose Less beautiful and pure of petal blows Because no mortal the bright blossom sees? The haunt of every violet God's heart knows: And all the golden gorse upon the leas That loads with lavish scent the lingering breeze For God in its rich glory of colour glows. God hears all Nature singing unto him:— And so the poet inwardly is 'ware Of his own song's divine blue summer air,— Yea, though the world of man should wax quite dim, Still would that summer of his song be fair And fill the cup of rapture to the brim. SONNET XVI THE SPEECH OF THE DEAD MAN Ah! was it worth while?—Yes, I have renown. Through the white folds of this embracing shroud I hear them crying my old name aloud On earth: they bring my silent corpse a crown. But ah, the fruitless gift! Could I bend down Just once again, though even in humble bower, And gather once again love's humblest flower— Could I gaze deep into soft eyes of brown— Could I feel once again the gracious hand Of woman,—waiting as the sweet night grows One with the passionate heart of every rose In every garden of the moonlit land,— 'Twould be worth more than mightiest labours reap, Crowned or uncrowned, that end in unkissed sleep. SONNET XVII THE WORLD'S MODEL Not till thine eyes shine, are the sea-waves blue: Not till the beauty of thy breast was born, Did white foam put white lily-cups to scorn: No stars were golden till thy hair's bright hue Flashed on the planet's morning. Over and through The woodlands sighed no tender summer breeze Till thy voice gave its key-note melodies To every leaf, to every wind that blew. Never an ash-tree bent with supple charm Till thou didst teach the boughs and stem their skill By curve of gracious body or throat or arm:— Till thou didst sing, the bird-choirs all were mute: Thy laughter gave its music to the rill; And thy lips reddened the yet pallid fruit. SONNET XVIII THE FIRST KISS Lo! the first kiss of Eve when the first night Fell over Paradise,—the blue profound Far heaven of darkness slowly closing round And silent star-ships steering into sight. The world is shadowed, but Eve's eyes are bright And sunshine in her golden locks is bound:— First they had feared the unheard-of dark,—but found The passionate darkness sweeter than the light. Yes: the first kiss. And since that far-off hour Lips tender and innumerable have met; And lips shall meet sweeter than any yet; But in that star-watched and God-hallowed bower Man's hand first gathered love, the dark night's flower, And when the sun rose, dropped it with regret. SONNET XIX THE LAST KISS Yes: the last kiss. For there shall come a last.— When the whole race has dwindled, and the air No longer serves us,—dense or over-rare; When human history hath an endless past, But not one future day: when tired winds cast About for flowers, but find no flowers to wear: When the last rose on the sparse hedge is fair: When the whole living world's flag flies half-mast:— Then there shall come a last kiss.—Shall not it, Full of a desperate sweetness unforeseen, Something of all past history's raptures win,— And shall the woman's wild eyes not be lit With stranger light than of the setting sun? Will all life die not, when that kiss is done? SONNET XX MY ISLAND “O one sweet island in my soul's waste sea!” —Philip Bourke Marston. Thou art my island in some Southern sea! Brood over me with long green tender hair And kiss me with strange blossoms, and with air Of speechless and undreamed-of purity. O island, give thy magic calm to me: Embrace me with thy night, when thou dost wear The jewels of all the skies,—and with thy fair Blue lustrous morning: clasp me laughingly. Within thine island-arms no death abides, Nor sin, nor any horror. Lift me and save With thine unsearchable and viewless bloom. Sing to me with thy coral-kissing tides: Flow round my body with thine amorous wave: And, when sweet life is over, be my tomb! SONNET XXI OUR LOVE-LEGACY O lovers of the future, unto you I give the wreath my love took joy to wear— In summer woven, when the golden air Kissed from the meadow-sweet its pearls of dew. I give the passion of the wide sea's blue And the star-blossoms that the black meads bear To you;—and all we found so very fair,— The honeysuckle's scent, the tulip's hue. Love ye the better that we leave you this, Our passion-legacy:—the lofty night, The morning's rapture and the storm-wind's bliss; Aye, more, love's strange immeasurable delight. Be yours—as ours—the memory of a kiss To tarry with you till pale time takes flight. SONNET XXII “THOU ART THE SAME” I. Death! Still thou art the same. We know thee well, And yet we know thee not.—The son to thee Gives up his grey-haired mother, and the sea Yields up its lords; the green stalk yields its bell. The first-born rose at night's first footstep fell, And last night's deaths solved not the mystery:— We know not what behind the veil may be— Limitless heaven, or unimagined hell! Thou art not changed. While love and passion veer Like storm-beat ships, and all the ways of man Waver, thou dost one changeless straight course steer: Tight on the tiller are thy fingers wan: Thy lips have never lost that mocking sneer With which their cruel curséd work began. SONNET XXIII “THOU ART THE SAME” II. Thou hast not changed since far-off Rachel wept For her first-born. A million mothers more Have wailed as through their hearts thine arrow tore And their hearts' darlings on a sudden slept. O'er countless battle-fields thy foot has leapt, Splashing exhilarate 'mid the dull red gore:— Thine ears have bent to hear their hollow roar, When over choking ships thy waves' lips crept. Thou art the same. And, long ere history spoke,— Ages ere e'en papyrus-leaves preserved The deeds of man,—thou wast as cruel; thou Watching the ruin wrought by thy sword-stroke In some dim heart and tawny body curved Over her dead in lands the sea holds now. SONNET XXIV THE MIRAGE-RIVER Between us after loving faithful years An ever-widening river seemed to spread; The grass on either side was dank and dead; We seemed too far apart even for tears. Smaller to each, each other's figure grew And fainter,—till against the sunset red Gleamed only an expanse of steely blue:— Where joy had been, waste water stretched instead. But on a sudden lo! a thrush sang out.— Then we took heart and towards each other came And lo! the river was a mirage. Flame Of deep green grass and flowers gleamed all about: Where ripples desolate had plashed and rolled, Our hands were powdered with the lilies' gold. SONNET XXV FIRST LOVE O first love,—tender holy blind pure phase!— For then it seemeth to the soul that one And but one woman liveth,—that the sun Finds but one blossom worthy of his gaze. Is it a snowdrop?—Then by green hedge-ways We think no gleaming rose-bush ever grew! White is our flower,—so never harebells blue The sun loved, nor the rich gorse' golden blaze! Ah!—Some day blind eyes open and we see On every side far fairer than the old New blossoms springing,—marvelling we behold Petunia, cowslip, heath, anemone:— As from our heart a sudden veil is rolled,— We revel in Woman's sweet diversity. SONNET XXVI NEW LANDS, NEW POETS New lands will bring new poets. By the streams Of far Australia poets will be heard, Choosing their similes from strange-fledged bird,— Writing love-sonnets where blue water gleams By banks of flowers more gorgeous than our dreams!— In South America, or Mexico, Or where the Indian feathery palm-fronds grow, Song will awake,—and search out untried themes. New Beatrices in those far-off lands Shall thrill new Dantes into song as large: When songless is our old grey ocean's marge, Sonnets shall watch the moon from far-off sands; And song shall find a new diviner bower When the new hemisphere breaks into flower! SONNET XXVII LOST RICHES O riches of all the ages we have missed! Dark eyes, dark tresses, in old Eastern lands,— Wonderful thrilling of electric hands,— Lips fairer than all flowers, alas! unkissed. Blue tender veins on Cleopatra's wrist,— Eyes gazing over thirsty Indian sands,— Eyes watching wild waves break on Northern strands Pine-shadowed;—oh, the long heart-piercing list! And whom of all that long list have we seen? Poets, who have the eternal heart of Time Mixed with your own in magnitude sublime, Ye have kissed the lips it may be of one queen Of love and song, and crowned her in your rhyme,— One!—yet red lips are numberless, I ween! SONNET XXVIII EVEN IN HELL In what strange places have our spirits met!— Sometimes upon the green downs high and bare; Sometimes amid the tossed sea's stormy air; Sometimes in gladness; often in regret. Only one thing has happened never yet,— That I should call, and thou shouldst not be there! Desire,—and find no answer to my prayer;— I owe thy faithfulness a ceaseless debt. Such woes we have conquered, and such barriers scaled, And after such defeats have risen upright, That, if hell's fiery storm-bolts round me hailed, I should expect thee to divide that night And, vainly by the lurid ghosts assailed, To bring me with thyself the old delight. SONNETS (1876, 1877) I. “OUT OF PLACE” AND “IN PLACE” Now I have seen thee, and I hereby swear That all those sonnets never were “in place” Except when smiling upward towards thy face Or nestling, starlike, in thy raven hair. Thine actual presence has but added grace And charm to the Ideal: how could it e'er Do aught but charm and help? Could it impair Thought's image, sought by me in lengthened chase? Thy face and voice have been with me. They stayed When thy slight girlish figure in the shade Of night was hidden, and I was left alone: Yet not so! for the memory is so clear That I can almost see thee standing here And listen, as I listened, for each tone. II. TO “YOU” I name thee not. Thou art too sweet to name.— In heaven thou shalt be music or a flower, A portion of God's bright sky, or a flame, Or singing-bird in some celestial bower. I seal thee mine by true love's kingly power, Aye, mine the more for this world's empty blame: I only love thee more, sweet hour by hour, Though loveless voices cry, “Such love is shame!” We will caress in roses,—and when night Is on the earth our passion shall be one With the vast passion of the moon and stars. When morning puts the starry hosts to flight Our lips shall meet, in presence of the sun: Yea, in earth's prison, we kiss between the bars. III. PAIN'S PURPOSE They are not good, the sorrow and the pain, Save only as leaders unto higher things: When agony, with black or blood-red wings, Flaps round our brows it is that we may gain Some higher gift that God's stern servant brings. The thorn-crown means that some day we shall reign Crowned not with thorns but flowers,—as queens and kings Able the imperial sceptre to retain. Through mortal pain we pass towards being painless: Yea, towards the kingly life that God lives; stainless, Purged of desire, and perfect in its scope. The daily agony whose hot darts pierce With flight unintermittent, swift and fierce, Is wreathed with this unintermittent hope. IV. THE ONE STAR There are sad places where no starbeam shines, Waste desolate abysses of the dark, Where no glad light the wandering soul may mark,— Whereover the black waves in stormy lines Pour ceaselessly:—spots where no angel's foot Has trodden; lurid as deep deadly mines: Hell-pits wherein the lingering captive pines; Devoid of buds and flowers and gracious fruit. What star can light them, or what step traverse These regions branded with a mystic curse? What help can reach the prisoners therein bound,— Cold pulses there shall throb at what glad sound? What flame, what fire, can comfort there impart? Only the sweet fire of a woman's heart. V. “I SEE FOR THEE” I see for thee, where thou canst never see. I fight for thee, where thou canst never fight. I bear for thee a radiant torch of light From Art's pure temple, burning high and free. Blossoms I gather too from hill and lea, Some sad, all tender, some divinely bright: I clothe thee with a portion of love's might; Lo! in my arms, when tired I carry thee. And all I ask is that thou wilt be glad And pure and sweet and true-souled; as thou art: True to the intuition of thine heart, And happy—'tis enough that one be sad! Be thyself simply; and, love, lady, friend, Trust me,—oh, trust me to the very end! VI. A RED SEA-WEED (A NEW YEAR'S GIFT) A gracious present! for it carries all The past wrapped fondly in its blood-red folds. Utterly deep significance it holds: Across the silent years it seems to call. It tells of countless bitter tears let fall And of bright early happiness besides: It speaks too of the buoyant summer tides, And wintry waves that stormed the grey sea-wall. I take it as a token from the graves Of thy sad past. Thou givest it, and lo! This blood-red frond that bloomed amid sea-caves Hath power thy present heart of love to show: This weed that still preserves the scent of waves Which broke at Whitby twenty years ago! VII. ANOTHER HILL Another hill surmounted hand in hand We pass towards other suns and other days: Before us, glittering through the noon-tide haze, Gleam the far portals of another land. The summits whereon you and I must stand, Snow-clad, enrapture now our upward gaze; We quit the valleys and the rose-hung ways, And follow out Love's uttermost command. Ah sweet! when you and I alone succeed With hearts that quiver and with feet that bleed In reaching that strange mountain-summit there, Shall we not smile—as round our close-linked hearts The unsullied wind, straight from the sunrise, darts! Shall we not laugh—amid that sinless air! VIII. “MORE, MORE, HAD I THE POWER’ More, more, had I the power, my soul would do.— Am I content,—till all thy soul is bright With God's own passionate unearthly light, And on thy forehead all God's heaven of blue Set like a jewel? Lo! I would renew Thy soul, long-lost amid the pathless night,— Be thine eternal champion in the fight,— Bring thee from false ends towards love's purpose true. O love, thou knowest me not! My love hath lightened From end to end of heaven, and heaven hath brightened; It is a tender gift:—it is a sword To cut all chains and armlets that surround thee. Astray thou wast,—but lo! thy love hath found thee. Rise. Thou art free to meet thy rightful lord. SPIRITUAL PASSION: TWO SONNETS I. [I feel towards God just as a woman might] I feel towards God just as a woman might Who hears her lord praised by the adoring crowd:— Who hears them hymn his strength with pæan loud— His glory in thought or speech, his force in fight. She knows him better. Through the silent night She has watched his face beneath keen sorrow bowed; Him she has cherished with embraces white; She has kissed the lips that seem to men so proud She cannot fear: she loves. She can but smile That men should dread like some disastrous wand His sceptre wielded o'er the people, while She knows the sea-deep love that lies beyond. She trusts her lord without one thought of guile, Knowing her union holier and more fond. II. [Or, as a man might love some haughty queen] Or, as a man might love some haughty queen I love God. How the lover might rejoice At accents he finds silvery of that voice Which makes the base slaves tremble, and the mean! The lover faces her with look serene, Who knows the grey eyes and the clinging breast By him in sweet proximity possest Are all too sweet for wrath to intervene. O sweet sweet gleaming body of a God! No wrath there is in thee: the lover trod Unchidden that queen's palace-chamber through— And so I likewise fearlessly embrace Thy form, and look thy glory in the face; Thine inmost woman-heart is gentle too. January, 1877. THE BRIDEGROOM OF VENUS Not with the autumnal leaves so red and golden Nor with the autumnal light Crowned art thou, Venus, when strong suns embolden Thy coming yet more bright. Thou art not springlike, nor of mortal seeming, Nor must thy bridegroom wear The buds of April, tender, soft and gleaming, Within gold spring-blown hair. Thou art as summer. When thy June around thee Burns splendid through the blue We know that then the fervent year has found thee Robed in thy raiment new. And then thy bridegroom, weary of the daughters Of earth though sweet they be, Yearneth for thy gold locks beside the waters Of thine own amorous sea. And he must mix his soul with summer glory,— Not craving for cool shades, Or autumn hues, brown, radiant, gold and gory, Or springlike colonnades. Thy mouth is summer: and thy bridegroom knowing The flower so strange and fair Must kiss the amorous gorgeous petals glowing Against the torrid air. Not ever again can common loves content him: This is his sad great doom! Now that thine arrow of golden love hath rent him, Point-poisoned from thy bloom. But evermore, until his spirit find thee, He wanders and must seek, Weary and mad till love again may bind thee: Weary and pale and weak. Thou liftest up for him thy soft long lashes And gazest in his eyes And o'er him the wild sense of summer dashes And light of summer skies. Thou holdest him in arms that know no limit To pleasure of embrace:— With mouth that hath nor age nor death to dim it And deathless queenlike face Thou liftest him to regions past man's dreaming And makest him sublime; Inspiring all the swift thoughts that whirl streaming Along the tides of rhyme. Equal with thee in majesty of yearning Must he, thy bridegroom, be; Loves lesser than thine awful one love spurning Like the contemptuous sea. This is the doom of him who loving summer Knew not the summer's charm, But thought to hold her like a frail new-comer By force of mortal arm. Not knowing that the sweet June's very favour Is death to him who breathes The intoxicating sweet month's flower-fed savour, Or dallies with its wreaths. For Venus in the sweet air spreads her pinions Whose plumage sways and flows, And flowers she hath for ministers and minions, A slave in every rose: So that her breath enchanting and entrancing Saddens and hurts and slays; Man cannot bear her shield of sunlight glancing Across the bright-helmed days. Autumn we bear; but not the summer's brightness And not the summer's bloom. Sorrow we bear; but not love's perfect whiteness And tender close perfume. So, truly, when the queen of all love's splendour, Venus, takes in her arms, More than all earthly tenderest women tender, A mortal spirit and charms And chains him, he must reach through strength of passion And kingly force of will, Loving in limitless immortal fashion, Heaven's heights,—or love must kill. But, whether slain or unslain, let love find us, And with her sunlike hair Enchant and ravish and pervade and bind us,— For love alone is fair. May, 1881. THE DEATH OF LONDON When the great city sleeps amid the reeds,— Yea, when the silent far-off centuries bring Peace on their wing,— When to wild toil the supreme rest succeeds,— When linnets sing Where now through Blackfriars Bridge the brown stream speeds,— When Westminster is deep in water-weeds,— Death shall be lord and king. The Thames comes circling from wild days afar; Once matted rushes filled the water-way Where grand and grey The tall-towered Abbey meets the morning-star; From day to day The awful weary ceaseless town has grown,— The skies have heard its multitudinous moan,— Centuries have fled away. Centuries have seen the sorrow of the town: O'er the grey Abbey close beside the stream Moonrays that gleam And fiery suns of summer have flung down Through deed and dream Their love and pity;—and the water brown Has surged around the bridges as they frown Over the waves with heavy arch and beam. What cries of woe the silent skies have heard! Shrieks not of bird But of lone desolate pale human thing, With fluttered wing Seeking the peace the river's dark waves bring. What secrets strange and deep In the grim tideway sleep: And yet in June how the blue ripples sing! What awful speechless pain of woman and man, Since the great stream began To eddy around the roadways of a town, Its dark waves drown! What tides of strife have coursed along the streets! Yet still to-day the city's live heart beats; And still within its leaf-embosomed squares The gold laburnum kisses the spring airs. O London, thou most terrible of cities! What was primeval Babylon to thee? Or Carthage, or old Rome, or Nineveh? Thee the red moon that riseth o'er thee pities,— Yea, the sun weeps for thee: The Thames is but the river of thy tears Seeking through wooden arch and granite piers The sea. Paris,—ah! Paris. White and fair she sits, Crowned and a queen. Through her bright fairy streets the light air flits Soft and serene. Her streets have foamed with blood;—and yet most fair Like a sweet tourney-queen she sitteth there, And all her pain seems vanished like the pain Of dead flowers that no June brings here again. Paris has seen Napoleon,—and has heard The tread of conquerors—twice: but our grim town Unconquered ever wears its own grim crown, And hearkens ever to its river's word. Its grey and sunless springs Have witnessed wilder things Than e'en the springs of Paris,—though they be Blood-bright and sun-illumed alternately. Ah! the fair eyes that in the city's deep Have sunk to sleep: Ah! the strong hearts that underneath the light So weird and white Of that same moon have yielded to despair: The golden hair On which the London gaslight has shone down,— The soft lips slain by horrors of the town! Through century after century the same cry Still storms the sky: Men still are born; and passion's rose is born And lives one morn;— But still the pitiless brown river leaps Through arch and pier, And still the moonlight on the water sleeps, So silver-clear! Wars we have had: ah! many a stirring day. How in that grey Cold spring the Guards' battalions marched away To the Eastern plains! War was declared against Russia on March 28, 1854. Little the skies and stars and clouds can care; Still the same river singeth in our ear Through suns and rains Its one same endless soulless note and clear. And so it shall be to the very end; Till all towers fall: Till the high stones of Westminster descend; Till night clothes all: Till in the peace that knows not change nor waking The city rests, a ruin: till moonlight making The ripples silver,—sunset and day-breaking,— See nought but sand and weeds, or perhaps a moss-grown wall. It shall be better then: all shall be peace Again the reeds shall fill The quiet stream; all human sounds shall cease: All shall be sweet and still. The thrush again shall trill Forth tender love-notes to his listening mate Amid tall trees where once was pomp and state: Grass shall deck Holborn Hill. Oh how the lark shall soar above green meadows Where once lost women strolled! Across the Strand shall stretch great elm-trees' shadows! Bright buttercups of gold Shall fill the silent deserts of the squares, And birch and hazel and oak Shall glisten under fogless summer airs Where men's hearts sank, and women's spirits broke. March, 1882. GOD AND THE SUN The sun has strength to fill the far untrodden places With flowers, and force to fold in infinite embraces Through all the centuries long Mead after mead, and hill on hill, and valley on valley: Can ye forbid his fiery love-shafts forth to sally? Can one monopolise the solar song? Can one flower quite usurp the bounty of Apollo? The garden of roses first: but then the green deep hollow His rays with violets fill. He kisses the bright sea whose whole face gleams to meet him: Then, next, the lordly mounts with sheeny spears entreat him; And next he kisses the brown moorland rill. The sun is like to God,—of infinite compassion And full of awful might of universal passion And full of force supreme. The pale star loves but one. The sun loves where he listeth: Yea whatsoever sweet and fragrant thing existeth,— In far green valley or by fair blue stream. The pale star loves but one. The strong fierce fiery solar Sublime bright endless rays from southern unto polar Strange regions dart their flame. What flower of all the flowers within the world resisteth Or deeplier in the grass its pliant soft stem twisteth, Sad at his advent? Unto each he came. Godlike and full of God, the amazing sun hath crowned us And poured his ceaseless flame of golden bounty round us— Resistless, endless, great. Hath yonder sweet and fair soft lily of the valley Strength into one to bind his red spears when they sally Forth through the awestruck morn's columnar gate? The armies of the sun march forth in endless legions And flowers they find and win from infinite far regions And lead in triumph home. Not one blue hyacinth the great sun into glory Of azure tints doth kiss, but each,—and all the hoary Wild wind-spread masses of the wandering foam. The cold moon loveth little. But can ye bind Apollo,— Unto the fiery god prescribe what path to follow? Haply he tires to-day Of English chill-lipped loves, and seeks in southern places New flower-lips sweet to kiss and new soft flower-embraces; Who hath the power the sun-god's course to stay? Chain ye your stars and moons. The sun not God's hand chaineth. The sun hath will like God and every chain disdaineth And all your ropes and bars. As is God than the sun, so is the sun supremer In fiery might of deed than every planet-dreamer,— Than all your thin-lipped hosts of moons and stars. What hand can touch the sun? What power lay down a limit To his own fiery force, or reach his flame to dim it Or hinder on its way The cataract of his rays that pours in endless torrent Down airy void vast steeps, a burning golden current,— Who shall the sun's impassioned will gainsay? Before the earth was born the great sun loved the flowers On other hills than these,—in other vales than ours: And, when the earth is dead, The sun will still illume his pathway wintry and vernal And pour forth still the same vast loving light eternal And still lift Godward his gold fearless head. God and the sun.—If none were left but these two only Still would they each pursue their silent pathway lonely; The sun would, Godlike, shine, And God would, sunlike, still rule o'er the empty spaces Though never more his eyes met answering human faces Nor, more, his nostrils smelt the rose or pine. These two, and these alone, have power of life undying Within them, fiery sun to fiery God replying; These: and these two are one. Love is the spirit that pours its fountains fierce and deathless Through the vast solar flame. Though all things else lay breathless, Still would these two abide: God and the sun. April, 1883. MY SEA-BIRDS I would have led the way from hill to wooded hollow And shown to these the paths the larks and linnets follow And where the violets sleep. I would have led the way up mountain roads and valleys And through the yellow-green primrose-embroidered alleys, And led them by the keen-breathed white-waved deep. I would have loved them well,—with tender love immortal. What canst thou do for these? Canst thou pass through the portal Wherethrough the singers throng? Canst thou upon thy loves bestow the wide sea's blessing And the gold morning's kiss, impassioned and caressing, And all thy soul's kiss in an endless song? These are sea-birds of mine. And thou dost seize and bind them! With dark-green haze of woods thou bafflest and dost blind them, My panting white sea-birds!— This is a deadly wrong. Their wings look strange and homeless Amid the billowing woods wind-stricken and yet so foamless; The leaves hide from them the wind's lips and words. O robber-hand,—and ye who heed the robber's calling! Lo! over the wide sea the purple dusk is falling: The stars shine one by one. Amid this tangled maze of green leaves will ye linger? Nay, spread white wings and join your lover and your singer Long ere the morning's blue waves kiss the sun! March, 1883. THREE SONNETS I. ON THE PROPOSED CHANNEL TUNNEL O England! England! whose bright stormy breast Hath met the kiss of sunlight and of sea For ages; round whose white sheer cliff-sides flee Winds only and sea-birds: why wilt thou divest Thine own self of thine armour? Rather rest In thine own water-walled security;— Let tempests and the waves conspire with thee; Leave thou thine eaglets in their pathless nest. Keen brains are plotting,—wild foes lurk around: Through tunnelled glooms how vast an host might pour. Oh! never let the English heart be found Who, hearkening to the billows' friendly roar, Will say—though love is in their very sound— “Sea, thou hast been our shield. Be so no more.” March 30, 1882. II. WRITTEN AFTER SEEING MADAME SARAH BERNHARDT, AS DOÑA SOL IN VICTOR HUGO'S “HERNANI” I have not lived in vain, for I have heard The voice of Doña Sol: the voice that brings Tears to the heart and eyes, and giveth wings Immortal and divine to every word. O strange voice, fluting now like some soft bird, Now full of resonant fieriest wrath that stings And pierces, dagger-like,—how each note rings In the soul's very depths, supremely stirred! It is thy glory that thou hast the power Even on Hugo's greatness to bestow An added greatness, and from hour to hour To hold us so completely rapt that, lo! If sunrise round us brake in golden shower, Or death came, we should neither care nor know. June 8, 1882. III. LEON GAMBETTA This is his title of honour. On the day When, dealing out across the circling snows Their countless fierce-tongued cannons' iron blows, The German hordes around his city lay; When ravaged armies knew not whom to obey, And half the Imperial Guard in red repose Slept in the meadows, and no man arose With any voice save only of dismay: Then he stood up, and with clear scornful glance Defied the intruder. Now he lieth dead, Smitten by keener than the German lance: Yet by our sons' sons shall it not be said, “This man alone, when all men's hopes had fled, Despaired not of the Republic, or of France”? Jan. 4, 1883. TO A YOUNG AMERICAN LADY We met upon the pier and parted, That August evening fair: I pass the same spot, weary-hearted; You are not there! The continent will soon receive you; Paris will hold you fast And lure your love, and never leave you One vision of the past: And Switzerland with snowy mountains Will rise upon your sight, And by the Rhone's green swift-foot fountains You will forget that night. We might have done so much together, If Fate had kinder been! Paced summer woods in still blue weather, My grey-eyed stranger-queen! I English and an English singer, You from America, If time had had the heart to linger, Had had so much to say! But lo! the chance was missed. I never Asked even of your name, And now the eternal time-waves sever, And you I may not claim. But take this song, and let my yearning Across far skies and seas Fly winged, and reach you slowly turning Through moonlit orange-trees. And let me say how through the flying Swift years that are to be I still shall bear in mind that dying Gold sun across the sea. That sun we saw, and star that lightened Above the calm blue deep:— New dawns have flamed, new sunsets brightened,— But still you haunt my sleep. You come in dreams, and will come ever While wind and sun and sea Are still the same. I know that never Your image quite will flee. Just twenty minutes' talk,—then parted! So life and love are spent: But I am always heavy-hearted; And are you quite content? Aug. 9, 1882. SONNET TO PHILIP BOURKE MARSTON O thou who seeing not with thy mortal eyes Yet hast the sacred spirit of sight to see The soul of beauty in Nature more than we; Yea, thou who see'st indeed the sunset skies And all the blue wild billows as they rise And summer sweetness of each bower and tree,— Who see'st the pink glad thyme-tuft kiss the bee, The silver wing that o'er the grey wave flies: We hail thee, singer who hast sight indeed If to see Beauty and Truth and Love be sight; For whom the soul of the white rose is white, And fiery-red the fierce-souled red sea-weed; We hail thee,—thee whom all things love and heed, Pouring through thee their music and their might. March 7, 1882. WRITTEN ON A WARM DAY IN DECEMBER I Round and round the weary land Run the signs of Venus' hand Most fair: Blue the gentle skies, and bland The air! II Surely in the mossy nooks There are violets, and the brooks Are edged By soft petals,—and the rooks Are fledged! III Surely roses soon will blow, For the starry bloom of snow This year Not a meadow seems to know Nor fear! IV Surely Love will soon arise With the summer in his eyes, And dreams Of the tender moonlit skies And streams! V In the winter when the cold Starves the sheep within the fold,— Nor shines The hair of tawny gold Love twines; VI Then dreary are the days,— But the meadows and blue bays This year Mark the summer sound of lays Most clear! VII For the mellow skies are bright, And the plumage of the white Snow-storm Scatters not the clouds so light And warm. VIII And the nights are still as fair As in June, when all the air Was gay, And when beauty shone too rare For day! December, 1881. A SINGER'S EPITAPH “Nay, think not evil of him; he is dead: His heart was white, if warring hands were red: He rests in peace: forgive him”—so God said. “He fought a battle that ye cannot see, And sought with terrible great passion Me: His work is over; let the singer be. “He fiercely strove for the superb embrace I grant my chosen,—met Me face to face, Standing like Moses in an awful place. “He sought the kiss of Deity,—and now It rests for ever on the dead calm brow: He lived in Me,—ye understand not how. “His soul was one with all the stars and seas And with my vast inspiring spirit in these; He heard the messages of flowers and trees. “He worshipped Beauty with a love divine, Pure at the root and passionate like mine; Red roses for his wreath with white combine. “Red roses,—for his heart was ever red With weary sweet swift-dropping life-blood shed For man and woman; twist them round his head. “White roses,—for his heart was pure within, And some was sorrow that ye counted sin; He sought what most have little zeal to win. “He sought with vast and ultimate desire His soul to mingle with my Godhead's fire, And, lifted once, to struggle ever higher. “His sins were many: but the love that trod That awful upward road towards me, me God, Hath cleansed his sin: he ever walked thorn-shod. “Not ever for one moment of one day Was suffering's bitter harrowing goad away: With him, to love and battle was to pray. “They are not what ye think; these poets shed Their blood for man, and, ere ye know, are dead: Lo! I can love and honour”—so God said. June, 1881. QUEEN BEAUTY I Queen Beauty far beyond the battle, Amid those hills divine, Far from the muskets' weary rattle, In groves of odorous pine Or soft green fields where russet cattle With the deep grass combine, Reposes:—and her tresses deep Are scattered o'er her limbs asleep. II There Beauty rests,—and will surrender If thou wilt seek her there. Then she will clothe thee with gold splendour Of outpoured fragrant hair, And cleave to thee with lips most tender, And all the summer air Shall fold thee round about with dim Robe swathing every weary limb. III Is this not better than the shaking Of all the cornfields red Beneath the tramp of cannon waking Wild echoes with wheeled tread? Is this not fairer than the breaking Of dawn o'er countless dead? Is her hair softer than the hue Of dead men's locks at Waterloo? IV Lo! this for each soul waits,—the pleasure Of love when battle ends: Love's limitless immortal treasure That Beauty's hand extends, And soft delight that knows no measure But deepens on and blends With the sea-surges whence she came,— A woman-heart, and goddess-flame. December, 1881. LIFE AND DEATH I The roses all are dead: the wintry winds are blowing Along the shivering streets and o'er the sighing field. Barren is every bed where once bright flowers were glowing: No more the hedgerows green their fragrant clusters yield. II And so it is with life. The days are growing greyer: The old loves depart and wither roselike, one by one; Nought can escape the spear of Time the blossom-slayer; Something of glory fades at every set of sun. III The hills shine still the same; the purple-robed dim mountains Are joyous as of old: but man from day to day Ages. The silver sea with undiminished fountains Sparkles: but some hope dies with every shower of spray. IV We are helpless in the hand of Force that urges onward: We cannot stay our feet; no faster can we go. Whither are we to turn? Moonward or seaward? sunward? Or to the hills' disdain? or to the fountains' flow? V O terrible blind God who urgest on our legions, Hast thou no eyes nor heart,—hast thou no heed nor care? Is there no conscious soul within the viewless regions? Only the silent void of unresponsive air? VI “And we shall mix with rose”—so say they—“and with lily; And with the tigers' joys and with the lions' glee: Laugh in the breeze that floats above the upland hilly: Smile in the stars that shine above the summer sea!” VII Folly! one single hour of warm sweet human living, With woman's lips to kiss and power her heart to sway, Surpasses all the joys wide Nature hath for giving: Outburgeons the full rose and mocks the starry ray. VIII Others again: “The dream of conscious living over, Our influence shall abide and flow throughout the race: We shall relive in souls of many a future lover; Burn through the flamelit love in many a future face. IX “All that we gave shall last. More glorious for cessation Of the small human life, our words like wingéd things Shall haunt the hills and meads of many a future nation,— Become to future souls their revelation-springs.” X Madness! a single day of winds' and waters' riot, While through the wild salt airs the sea-birds' pinions beat, Is lordlier than long years of rotten dead mute quiet Within the churchyard green, or underneath the street. XI And higher than all words ranks pure love o'er the glory Of posthumous renown, how high soever this: And nobler than new dawns o'er mountains grim and hoary Is the first sense of love within the throbbing kiss. October, 1881. IN TOWN AT THE END OF A LONDON SEASON Oh, for the sea's far splendour,— The cool wet sound of waves And tender Ripple within dark caves! Oh, for the wide-winged breezes That churn the waves to foam,— Heat seizes And slays us here at home! The weary head reposes On pillows hot in town: No roses The tired-out forehead crown. Oh for cool sound of waters And quiet sight of fern! Heat slaughters The hearts and heads that burn. Oh for green grass-leaves plashing In depth of crystal pool, And splashing Of surges blue and cool! Oh for cool arms of maiden And wave-cool wave-white breast, That laden Spirits therein may rest! Oh for far sound of rivers, And bowers with green entwined That shivers In the cool soft night-wind! We are weary and sick and deadened With heat in this close town Sun-reddened:— The roads are parched to brown. Take me, O loved one, take me Through green woods to the sea: Awake me,— I slumber drearily. Where the fresh seas are whiter Even than thy white breast, And brighter, Take me,—and let me rest! July 19, 1881. THE FLOWERS' FLIGHT Yea, all forsook him. Some had kissed his lips; They fled: They could not bear joy's gaunt eclipse And red. They followed him through many a summer day And smiled: They could not face the great waves grey And wild. They twisted roses in his sun-crowned hair, But when The thorns drew blood from fingers fair,— What then? They shuddered, and they flung the tender flowers Down hard. They had deemed him but for summer hours A bard. Their soft love-oath included not the night Storm-blown. Their hearts were pale, their hands were white: They have flown! The stars watch on, the garden flowers watch on, Most brave! But some star-spirits should have shone To save! The skies watch with him, and the foam of seas Gives light: The waves are gentle near his knees And bright. But ah! the spirits who promised many things And fair: Who gave the poet flowers and rings And hair. Where are they? Ask the shallow crowd that fills Hot rooms, Led hither and there as fashion wills And dooms. Where are they? Ask the floating clouds that sail The sky. Ask the wind's ceaseless weary wail And high! Where are their kisses? Ask the roses dead To tell! Ask the winged fairy feet that fled So well! And where is he? Beneath the night he stands Uncrowned: The blossoms woven by loving hands Unwound. Alone, yet not alone: there is a Power Supreme Who crowneth not with kiss or flower Or dream,— A Power who lifteth to his great embrace The man Alone, forlorn, with tired-out face And wan. July, 1881. TWO SONNETS I. SINKAT Men slaughtered, women ravished, children slain: Men, women, children, who for months had dreamed That English bayonets ere long would have gleamed Over the sunburnt hopeless southern plain.— I think there never thrilled a deeper pain Quite through the heart of England than to-day! To know that each soul as it passed away Left first on England's hands its own blood-stain. O heart of England and great warring eyes That met the armies of the world and smiled And hands wherein the silent thunder lies Sleeping,—are ye now found too weak to save From slaughter's weltering ravening monstrous wave One weeping woman or one helpless child? Feb. 13, 1884. II. SINKAT AND MR. GLADSTONE The English heart was leashed.—We watched afar The desert hosts engirdling day by day The prostrate city where our duty lay Prisoned. From rise of sun to set of star Men called for England's help.—Who rose to bar The English spirit upon its fiery way? Who by weak deeds and imbecile delay Seared honour's white brow with a shame-red scar? One man: who when the heart of England burned Held back that heart, and said “Thou shalt not go.” Whose lips alone in all the land said “No;” Whose hands alone the pleading pale hands spurned. Who only in all the land quite tearless turned From that wild spectacle of lonely woe. Feb. 26, 1884. ONE LOOK I Have not I been as Love through all these years and given The bloom of flowers and light of stars to thee? Have not I raised thee high within song's bright-blue heaven?— What hast thou given to me? II Lo! flower on flower and star on star the bright months bring thee, And songs on songs have floated o'er the sea. My harp were traitor indeed if ever it failed to sing thee: What wilt thou give to me? III The flowers of fourteen years and all their love and laughter; The singing leaves of every green spring-tree; These have I given,—and more. And now what cometh after? Just one swift look for me! IV Just one look from the eyes that smote my youth, and slew me; That now will leave not even my manhood free. Just one swift flash of light that, lightning-like, darts through me: This,—and no more for me. V For songs and flowers and love and pain that Christ might covet,— Pain deep as fathomless eternity— Thy face to see once more, with hardly time to love it,— This, this is given to me! VI For limitless strong love, and shoreless wild devotion, What meet reward, love, think'st thou, can there be? What can the river give to the white-crested ocean? Trust.—Give that trust to me. June 30, 1883. TO A FACE I O virginal fair face, and eyes whose fire with sweetness Blends in divine soft flame and mystical completeness, I never knew How sweet the world might be, till thee I saw within it And felt all old mad dreams of love revive that minute And the sky's old blue. II Forgive me that I am old. Forgive me, face so peerless, That, though I cannot meet thy gaze unmoved and tearless, I was born afar From this to-day's bright world wherethrough, divine, thou movest And with thine eyes' strange light of inward force reprovest God's every star. III Forgive me that the world is fair and bright before thee But thunder-dark to me. Lo! let me just adore thee, O face! O face! Lo! half my life is lived,—or nearly all, it may be. But thou—what shall the light of heaven within thy day be! What, love's far embrace! IV I have to die. Forgive me.—All ye flowers, forgive me, Whose splendid summer bloom and glory shall outlive me: White rose newly blown Forgive me that I died while thou was just evading The soft green sheath of leaves thy tender beauty shading, Half coyly shown. V I have the love for all,—for flowers of stars preceding Our planet-star in space. I weep for blossoms bleeding In far-off lands. Yet I grow old while stars and blossoms beyond number Wax and increase. I seek death's sempiternal slumber: They seek Love's strong hands. VI Forgive me, all ye flowers whom I shall never furnish With soft love-songs whose wings beneath far suns that burnish Their bright plumes might fly, Forgive me that I love, but yet am not immortal: That ye wait at love's porch, while I wait at the portal Where love must die. May 20, 1883. MANY LOVES, YET EACH INTENSE SONNET “There is but one love pure and strong and deep In the whole life of each. No loves have power Again like first love into passionate flower To bloom. When first love fades, all love-songs sleep.” So thinkest thou? Nay! the whole soul can weep, Rejoice, and love, with limitless desire As many times as there are stars on fire To light the darkling fields the wild winds reap. If loves were many as all these starry fires That beacon, far on high, from void to void, There would be room for some new star-love buoyed By the dark air whose tender breath suspires Around it.—All past constellations' scorn Hinders no new sweet star from being born. January, 1883. WORDSWORTH AND THE MODERN SCHOOL I Of far-off purple hills and mist-crowned mountains hoary Wordsworth dreamed. His soul was one with clouds and golden sunsets' glory As they gleamed. II With mystic strength of soul and prophet's exaltation He beheld The glittering hosts of stars take up their nightly station, God-impelled. III Fair Nature was his Queen, and on her bosom ample He reposed. He heard not Passion's steeds, whose fiery swift hoofs trample: He disclosed IV The secrets of the hills, the secrets of the rivers And the skies,— Yet never felt the stroke that woman's soul delivers Through her eyes. V Ah! than the hills more fair, and than the rivers sweeter Unto me, And tenderer than the pulse of silver-voiced soft metre Of the sea, VI A woman's face and voice. Though hills and valleys bound me And the streams, I'd push them all aside if once my true love crowned me In her dreams. March, 1884. A SONG OF THE EARTH I Not of thee, Melancholy, But rather of joy's ceaseless summer sky And all the rapture holy That on the snow-white breast of love doth sigh I'd sing,—and not of heaven With endless golden harp and golden crown But of the stars of even And all the autumnal waving corn gold-brown And all the woodlands' glory When wild October gilds them with bright hand And the long sea-waves hoary Which fleck with rainbow foam the glittering sand:— Not of the angelic glances But of our women's eyes of sober grey Through which the sweet love dances And of their feet that linger in the way And of their heaven of passion Wherein the souls that worship them may dwell I sing,—in the old Greek fashion, For flowerless loveless heaven to me is hell. II I sing of hedgerow roses And quiet violets nestling in the green And vales where love reposes And meads where in the grass his hand is seen Flowerlike amid the flowers, White 'mid the lilies, scented 'mid the may: I sing of the soft bowers Where love was radiant in the world's young day Before the need of higher And holier loftier rapture—so they said— Thwarted love's living lyre And marred the sunshine on his golden head. III I sing of woman diviner Than loveless shapeless women of our day: I crown her, and assign her The chiefest holiest place within my lay. Before she sought for other Than the sweet love of earth, lo! it was well; Beauty was perfect mother To passion: she was godlike ere she fell. But now strange thoughts possess her And dreams of far-off stars and alien skies And the cold winds caress her And the sweet laugh hath vanished from her eyes And the old-world rapture ceases And woman bends beneath another yoke Than man's,—and care increases And what her hand first fashioned, then it broke. IV But for us life suffices And all its tender joys and dreamful ways: It lures us and entices With all its suns and winds and moony rays And magic months of summer When the soft air breathes infinite sweet calm And each rose, glad new-comer, Folds secrets infinite in pink-white palm. And when these fail, and, weary, We face the wintry gloom and death draws nigh With garb and brow most dreary And secrets of the tomb in sunless eye And laughter indecorous, It shall be sweet and of avail to know That loves in passionate chorus Sang round us, rose-wreathed, long strange years ago And that we sang, soft-timing Our song to all the waters' gracious tune With winds for ever chiming And following the chaste guidance of the moon:— That once for us the splendour Of the undying summer's bosom beamed, Ripe, copious, bounteous, tender, And once for us the summer's dark eyes gleamed Responsive and alluring Till our young hearts sprang forth upon the road, Fierce, eager, long-enduring, While round us all the rident morning glowed; And though the night hath found us And we too fade and fall and pass away Once sacred morning crowned us And love our call would answer and obey And we were full of daring And swift hearts failed not at love's voice to leap Though night is now preparing Gloom for us, and the inevitable sleep. May, 1881. UNITY IN COMPLEXITY The poet's work is one.—He sings in divers places Of summer and of spring, and soft and deep-lined faces,— Of rapture and despair: Of all the sorrow of love, and joy that this surpasses; Of the lark's nest amid the deep May-scented grasses; Of floating sea-weed and drowned golden hair. The universe is one to him.—He passes through it And at one glance, at times, like large-eyed God can view it: The whole of things he owns:— Death, horror, and the cry of human pain he fears not; There is not any note amid the whole he hears not,— Laughter of love, or sorrow's piercing tones. And then ye take his work and say “There's evil in it!” —Because the eagle is there, and not alone the linnet: —The lion, and yet the fawn: —The bitter cry of men upon the midnight tossing, When o'er their vessel's bows the white-maned waves are crossing: —The smile with which creation meets the dawn. Shall he say but one thing? Shall he sing but one season? Give all his heart to Spring? That were unheard-of treason To Summer's wishful gaze! Not fields are bright with corn alone, but also bloody With gaping wounds of men when the August moon gleams ruddy Over the landscape through a smoky haze. Doth the high god of dawn drape ever his bridal-chamber In the old yellow tints and glorious gold-washed amber? Doth he not deck the sky With splendid vast superb rich crimson radiation And with strange azure dyes and sudden deep carnation That blushes deeper as his bride draws nigh? Are all the forests full of flowers of but one colour? If roses grew alone, how infinitely duller This ruddier world would be! If ever the white manes of maddening mad sea-horses Raged, whirling round about the black ships' plunging courses, How we should miss our blue and foamless sea! So is the poet's song a diverse thing and ample.— He saw the wild red steeds the yielding corn-blades trample At far-off Waterloo. He heard the weird strange shrieks and deep groans of the dying, And saw upon the field the blood-stained bear-skins lying,— Blood on the scarlet coats, blood on the blue. He hears to-day the wind sweep o'er the same wide meadows And sees the gold corn flecked with countless dancing shadows; No dying forms are there; Only the blaze of calm triumphant summer sunlight,— Not as when all lights merged their lustre in the one light, The light that flames from battle's eyes and hair. Just as the wind has purged with infinite filtration That far-off battle-field where nation against nation Wrestled, for life or death: Just as the sea heeds not the dead vast hordes within it But laughs in God's clear eyes as virginal this minute As under the first morning's golden breath: Just as the forest heeds the countless dying flowers Within it not at all, but buildeth up new bowers More fair than all the old: Just as within the streets of white immortal Paris No sign to-day of red mad Revolution tarries But only gay wheels where the cannon rolled: So in the poet's song are all things found united:— Are lovers when they wind close clinging arms affrighted In that their marriage-bed Hath ere this heard the sighs of lonely souls unmarried? What is it unto them that their white couch hath carried The helpless cold weight of the inamorous dead? What is it that the moon through their bright curtains peeping Hath, through those curtains bright, gazed once upon the weeping Of some forsaken heart?— Just so, all-seeing at once, from palace unto prison Passes the undisturbed and all-embracing vision Of pitying pitiless soul-sleepless Art. In one house lo! a death. A marriage in another. The strange joy mixed with tears of some pale new-made mother Perhaps in an upper room. Perhaps in a room below some sorrow past expression.— Art graspeth all alike, and taketh full possession Alike of sunlit space and starless gloom. So with superb strong poise of pinions never-ending The soul of Art flies forth, her force of being blending With God's own power of will: Seeing with equal sight in plunging white sea-valleys The overburthened ship that pants but never rallies And groups of children playing on yon green hill. April, 1883. TO J. A. B. Back over twenty years we look. What blasts have sounded From War's red trumpet!—what fierce deadly strifes abounded: Strange is it, as back one looks! Since the old boyish time when you and I together Walked over purple miles of wind-tossed Cornish heather And watched the arrowy trout in Cornish brooks. Since the old Harrow days what bitter devastation Has smitten low the hopes of nation after nation:— Wide Europe's fields have bled Since you and I as boys laughed round the merry wicket; When all our worldly hopes were centred in our cricket, Nor mattered it if kings or popes fell dead! What was an Emperor's fate compared to winning merely A hard-fought racquet-match! The latter struggle clearly Meant most to gods and men! Ah! happy days,—ere love steps in with all its passion And moulds all things in new half-sweet half-mournful fashion: The days that pass, and glance not back again. In the long twenty years how many well-loved faces Have vanished from our gaze! How many vacant places, Looking around, we see. Yet still the glad old earth hath flowers to wreathe and cherish For us, old friend. Past hopes like dead leaves fall and perish, And young-leaved new hopes spring round you and me. The seasons come and go. The swift-winged swallow seaward Turns. The bright eyes of Spring turn hopeward, heavenward, gleeward. The autumn meadows gleam. Sweet Summer binds her hair in dark-green leafy places. Men die,—and love is born, and passion's white embraces Change all things into one wild golden dream. Some nations fall,—and new great nations rise above them. Sad human hearts are wrung when the true hearts who love them Pass, at the death-god's wing. Some friendships are quite dead, and others fast are going. Some passion-cups are dry that once were overflowing. But still our friendship is a living thing. How little once we thought that I, the Muses wooing, Should spend my days their shy sweet sidelong gaze pursuing And, after twenty years, Bring you these flowers of song,—some where the dew yet lingers, Some gathered later on with dust-stained weary fingers; Some bright; some blood-stained; and some wet with tears. Ah! when from Harrow hill we saw the far fields spreading Gilded with evening light, if life's path we are treading Had then as clearly showed, Should we have shrunk in dread, as we drew back the curtain? God only knows. But this, old friend, we know for certain: Our friendship has shed light on all the road. March, 1883. GOD'S JUDGMENT-DAY From all the ends of the earth the plaintiffs came.— “I lost my three sons in a day,” one said: The next, “My white-souled daughter wedded shame.” Then came a flower with overburthened head And petals filled with flush of vengeful flame; Weeping, it plained: “My sister rose was red; We loved each other, and we rested close Against the quiet garden's grey old wall Till the wind shook us roughly from repose And lo! one day I saw my sister fall. Now I am lonely; lonelier than those Who throng the sunlit flower-beds,—yea, than all. God, give me back my sister.” Then the man: “God, give me back my daughter. Lo! I saw Her poor face lit by gas, so peaked and wan, In a London street. The winter wind blew raw And down her rouge-red cheeks the rain-drops ran; Doth this not strike thy listless soul with awe?” Next came an Empress: “Surely thou hast done Worse things to me and sadder”—so she wept— “Than unto any soul beneath the sun. Our kingdom was stolen from us while we slept; Scattered was all the glory we had won, And lo! red Revolution's tiger leapt Upon us, and the people of France forgot All good deeds, and all bad were brought to light. My husband died. My son in loneliest spot Thou didst ordain the savage spears to smite, So making sonless too my widowed lot. God of the wide earth, answer. Was this right?” And then a woman: “Lo! an Empress' tears Move God perhaps. But has he heed of mine? Has he watched through the weary weary years My whole soul yearn and agonize and pine After the son who 'mid the serried tiers Of battle fell? Can God my grief divine? Lo! she was beautiful, that Empress there, And crowned and happy. I was quite alone —Save for my son the bond-slave of despair— Her husband levied to support his throne Vast armies, and my son they must ensnare: Empress and Emperor reap what they have sown.” And then another woman: “Lo! the waves Sucked down my husband on my wedding-day. God! hast thou not enough white watery graves Round thee in their interminable array That thou must add another?”—So she raves, With madness in her eyes of sunless grey. And then a prisoner: “In Siberian mines For fifty years I languished,—while the blue Sweet sky above me kissed thy waving pines And laughter came thy palace-gateways through. If thou dost place me where the sunlight shines Now, canst thou those lost fifty years renew? Canst thou restore my wife who 'neath the knout Perished? Canst thou restore my only child?” And then there came a grim voice from without, An Emperor's: “My rule was ever mild And clement. Yet one day the fires leaped out And left my limbs a shattered horror, piled Loose in the roadway.” Then his son exclaimed, “And my life is a horror likewise! I Though nowise crippled, blind, deformed, or lamed, Through palace-windows only see the sky And know myself through all my land defamed And stir not out unless my guards are nigh. Is this a life worth having,—knowing well That round about me murderous creatures wait To fling the bomb with red fuse dipped in hell? I dare not move beyond my palace-gate For fear of dull roar of the deadly shell. Armed guards surround and watch me early and late. God, is this just?” And next a butterfly: “Born on a sunny morning 'mid the flowers And waving grasses and green leaves was I. Rapture it was from fragrant fields to bowers All honeysuckle-girt to hover and hie, Trying in the swift air my new-born powers. But lo! a creature caught me in a net And through my struggling body thrust a pin (I feel the steely cold pang even yet!) And just as sweet life promised to begin Dead was I,—long before my first sun set. To make me, then to slay me, was a sin, Lord God! The eternal justice is in fault That I, when all my white-winged friends were free And happy, thus was marred by rude assault And stabbed to death. Lord God, canst thou not see That thus to pin me and prison in a vault Airless, with human quick dexterity, Was murder?” Then a poet rose and said: “I blame thee, God,—for though fair visions pass Gold-winged and grand and gorgeous through my head I cannot stay their arrowy flight, alas! I shall speak no true word till I am dead And o'er me waves thy never-ending grass! Why make me at all, if thus I must pursue Beauty, and never reach her though I follow With ardent tireless feet the whole world through; O'er mountain steep and down green-skirted hollow And over ocean-wastes of endless blue, Swifter than flight of summer-searching swallow? Of all created things we have the most And bitterest cause to blame thee. Thou hast poured Love in our hearts, and given us but a ghost Instead of love,—or slain love with thy sword. Now round about thy throne, a fiery host, We stand, with tongues that witness 'gainst thee, Lord.” And then a woman: “What is theirs to this Sorrow of mine that eats away my soul? —The bitter longing for love's flame-lipped kiss: —The daily journeying not towards any goal: —To dream of love, how passing sweet it is, And wake to hear love's wheels i'the distance roll. —To long to feel against one's white smooth breast And white smooth neck a lover's soft lips burn: —For love's divine unutterable rest With every pulse of womanhood to yearn: To follow love in a fatigueless quest, Yet to watch love's eyes ever shift and turn Aside,—is this not agony supreme? Thou, God, in heaven canst know not aught so grim And deep and terrible.”—But then a scream Rang round the vaulted judgment-chamber dim; A blood-stained soldier spoke: “Ah! God, I deem Thou never hast had in seas of blood to swim! Thou hast not felt the round-shot tear its way Through thy rent flesh, and, fallen amid the wheat, There lingered helpless through the maddening day, Crushed by the gun-wheels and the chargers' feet. Thou hast the great white clouds whereon to lay Thy head when fevered by the summer heat.” And then a husband: “Day by day my life Grows yet more wearisome. The flowers outside Laugh when they hear the shrill voice of my wife And toss their petals through the window wide, Mocking our endless miserable strife;— Ah! when I married, all my true soul died.” But then a woman spoke: “My husband slew All high thoughts in me,—till my lover came, And then the sweet and young thoughts bloomed anew; But now alas! each flower with scarlet shame Was tipped, and flushed beneath the sunny blue With trembling dread and streaks of passionate flame. God's face was in my lover's: yet I felt That duty drew me from him. When I fled, The very world beneath me seemed to melt And hell beneath me yawned wide open and red And stroke on stroke the sword of agony dealt Till I alive was mingled with the dead In all save outward seeming. Then one hour Again my lover came along the way And kissed my weary mouth till all aflower It laughed, and sudden sunlight flushed the grey Waste thornful branches of my hawthorn bower... And then—now, God, hast thou one word to say In thine excuse?—my husband's sword flashed out Straight from behind our tender bower of green, And red strange heavy drops ran all about, And lo! where, even just now, my lips had been Blood from my lover's lips welled slow without: O murderous God, who witnessedst that scene, Can I forgive thee?—Never! though the tears Ran down thy cheeks for ever.” Then a slave: “For eighty long unutterable years I watched the free wind through the reed-beds wave, And heard some women's laughter with mine ears, Yet never laughed,—till round me closed the grave.” And then a statesman: “Surely most of all Slaves are we who upon the people wait; On whom in turn the vengeful masses fall; Whom sometimes through the deadly prison-gate They lead, and sometimes on the steel-spiked wall Fix our grey heads in their dull poisonous hate, Though all our lives have done them service true. God, what of this?” And then a wild-eyed man: “God! surely thy misdeed thine heart shall rue. Through all eternity my curse and ban Shall rest upon thee! Whom thy keen sword slew, Let her forgive thee; for I never can.” And then a woman, pale, and all her face Deep-lined with grief: “I loved, and dreamed that he Returned my love. My beauty won more grace From the sweet thought. Yes, I was fair to see! And lovers thronged about me in each place. God, thou didst bid the tender dream to flee, As all the golden hues of perfect morn Flee through the morning's swiftly-closing gate.” She spake,—and with one voice the wild forlorn Strange group cried: “God, we crown thee with our hate, Hate,—and an inextinguishable scorn.” And then God's answer came in one word. “Wait.” March, 1883. WINGED LOVE “Though watched and captive, yet in spite of all, They found the art of kissing through a wall.” —Pope. I Through walls and doors Love goes: His lips are in the rose; His feet are on the hills; His voice is in the rills. II His breath is in the breeze; He thunders in strong seas; And through the arcades of morn He winds his hunting-horn. III What do ye, ye who bind Love? Can Love be confined By earthly bars or grates Or bolts or brazen gates? IV Through walls the winged kiss flies, And over gloom of skies: Through foes that cluster round It speeds without a sound: V Then it alights, and brings Soft gladness on its wings. What gaoler can descry The winged kiss hovering nigh! VI What prison can retain Love's plumes of golden grain? What haunt of woe and death Can bind Love's sky-sweet breath? VII At iron chains and steel Love laughs,—and barriers reel Drunken before his tread And light about him shed. VIII The sweetest kiss man knows Is that a woman throws Through narrowing prison-bars, So letting in the stars! IX So letting in the night And all its boundless might: So letting in the blue That the great moon sails through. X The most triumphant lips Are those which Love's mouth sips With twenty guards beside, And every guard defied! XI Love steals between all bars, As steal through these the stars. Foes wait in gaunt array? Love comes another way! XII While every door is sure And all the locks secure Behold Love, woman-wise, In at the window flies! June, 1881. SONNETS FROM THE ARABIC (1884) SONNET I THE MOON-RIVAL Yes, I am jealous of the moonlight's rays That met thine eyes in those far mystic lands! That moon's soft kiss that fell upon thine hands In far-off girlish unforgotten days This I am jealous of,—and of the lays The stars sang to thee, shining over sands Vast, treeless, limitless. When Love commands The dead years answer, and open wide their ways. O Southern stars and moon that met her eyes In earliest girlhood, when the sweet world came To lay upon her lips its flowers and flame And prison in her look its light of skies— O moon and stars that won from her replies Tender, hath she a soul for me to claim? SONNET II THE HIGHEST LOVE There never should be bitter words or pain Between a lover and a loving soul. From the first starting to the faint far goal Dimly descried on Time's eternal plain —The goal where white-peaked mountains soar and reign And where the far-off mountain-thunders roll— From love's beginning till death maketh whole Or sundereth, there should be not one tear-stain. It is within the reach of human hearts To love and love, and never to bring grief. The wild and passionate love that carries darts Within its love and thorns on its rose-leaf Pales out beside the love whose heart can say “Love's last is sweeter than love's sweet first day.” SONNET III “WE CANNOT SAVE ONE ANOTHER FROM DEATH” Nay, who knows that? Who knows what strength may be Within the spirit of love? What untried things Behind death's thunder-dark yet love-sweet wings? What might of passionate singing in the sea Of death that shall encompass you and me When envious Time the final parting brings? Oh that strange parting which so racks and wrings The spirit, may join two spirits eternally. “We cannot save from death”:—Nay, who knows aught Of what the deathless spirit of love can do? God who spreads out the eternal ocean's blue And laughs as star on star surpasses thought Hath care and love still left for me and you, And neither star nor we shall come to nought. SONNET IV A SUDDEN PANG It smote across me with a sudden pang, The thought that you must die. It shall not be! If there is soul of passion in the sea Or in the moon whose white orb used to hang Above the wild plains where thy spirit sang Its girlish love-song to infinity,— If there was love in sun or flower or tree Or river whose soft voice beside thee rang,— If there is love in the Unknown Power or me,— Thou shalt live onward through the viewless years. Oh when death calls thee, and thine eyes' bright light Fails, send for me. If I can see for tears I'll use my sword once more, and death shall flee, For love that dies not can put death to flight. SONNET V GENIUS AND WOMANHOOD Of all sweet lovely things God ever made I think the purest sweetest loveliest thing Was moulded when he let thought's sombre wing Touch woman's sunlit brow with genius' shade. It was a great thought when God, unafraid, First gave to woman passionate arms to cling:— But when God gave her fiery heart to sing A greater thought the Master's will obeyed. There is no greater thought of God than this: That woman in her spirit should combine Love and sweet genius,—that her hand should twine Laurels and roses,—that her lips should kiss, While her pure genius-hands the while design Work that outstrips the pale eternities. SONNET VI THY NAME Of all sweet names that sing in poets' ears I think thy name is sweetest. Soft and new It brought before me the broad Southern blue: My dreams were sweetened by thy girlish years, And hand in hand with all thy joys and fears I wandered thine enchanted uplands through, And saw the sunlight gild the wild “karroo,” And saw thy lonely sweet eyes fill with tears. I love the name,—the very sweetest name It is that heart of poet ever sung. I love to hear it linger on my tongue And feel that through the word the heart I claim: The heart so gentle, tender, and so young And yet so full of force, and full of flame. SONNET VII “IT SEEMS SO STRANGE” It seems so strange to me to think that thou Dost love our England and our English song! And yet before thee strange storms swept along And strange sweet Southern moonlight touched thy brow. I think of thee,—and wonder and wonder how Through thy young spirit eager, pure, and strong The thought of England darted, ere the throng Of English pilot-waves around the prow Of thy home-coming vessel danced and gleamed. What were thy thoughts in that far wondrous land? What flowers grew sweeter for thy loving hand? What stars grew softer as thy star-eyes dreamed Among them? What words whispered the white band Of Southern clouds that through the clear blue streamed? SONNET VIII MY WINGED MESSENGERS I'll send my messengers with airy feet And soft ethereal plumage to explore Those unknown regions, and from every shore That thou hast trodden to bring whispers sweet. That is my longing: I to-day would meet Thy past, and open dreamland's golden door,— Feel through the woman's lips her girlhood pour Delight too pure for song's lips to repeat. Can love not rival elemental things? Can love not distance star and flower and breeze? Can I not still the singing of the seas, Baffle the breezes with melodious wings? Can I not capture back from rose and pine Thy girlish love-thoughts, love—and make each mine? SONNET IX SADNESS That is what saddens this strange spirit of mine. Thou wast so far, so many leagues, from me While I was singing love-songs to the sea In England, and the English green-browed line Of rain-swept hills, and English eglantine:— My songs mixed voices with each summer tree And with the summer flowers—but not for thee I sang. The stars that watched thee made no sign. How could I guess that over leagues of sea A girl's soft whisper mingled with the night,— A girl's soft eyes with the far starry light That fell on plains that mocked eternity In their smooth endless undulating flight? Thou wast alive,—and I knew not of thee! SONNET X LOVE'S MIGHT That pains me so! To think the sunlight knew, The blossoms knew (or how could they have bloomed!) The sunsets knew thee, wild and crimson-plumed, Spreading their plumage over ceaseless blue. I was the one heart in the world untrue! That saddens me; for now so many entombed Sweet thoughts of thine may never be resumed. Can Nature's hand repeat one sunset's hue? I cannot penetrate with fiery speed The far star-spaces,—search the silent night For thoughts of thine that made dark spaces bright And sowed with new stars heaven's exalted mead. Yet love hath greater than the whole heaven's might And love can follow where a girl's eyes lead. SONNET XI REST O spirit, O love, canst thou bestow on me— Me who have wandered through the sable night For lonely ages,—who have watched the flight Of clouds from God's hand through eternity,— Who saw the stars when they began to be,— Who marked the first sun launch its golden light Upon the stormy blue,—whose weary sight Followed the breakers on the first grey sea:— Canst thou, O love, O spirit, on me bestow The one thing I am most in need of—Rest? I'd give my very soul to end the quest Eternal, agonizing, dark with woe. Sorrow has been my bosom's inmost guest Since Eden laughed in its first sunset's glow. SONNET XII THE STING OF DEATH This is the sting of death, that it includes The fact that thou must leave me. Oh, death knows And harps upon the sharpest of our woes! Not the sweet silences of dim pine-woods,— Not the bright airs of mountain-solitudes,— Not the white flashing of the far-off snows, Nor even the scent on June-nights of the rose Nor skies whereo'er the royal sunset broods— To leave these things is agonizing pain, But worse than all the pain of all these things And filled with sharper and more poisonous stings Is the black thought that I may still remain In this same world, yet never through all springs Mix thought with fiery thought of thine again. SONNET XIII “LOVE ALONE” Through life on weary life I seem to have passed, Seeking for thee.—Now weariness supreme Holds me. My lives' long battles like a dream Melt from me, ghostlike to the very last. My sword, all notched and blunted, lo! I cast Into the eddies of death's silent stream, Whereover floats full many a wan moonbeam: I meet the stream's pale outlook, weird and vast. Then lo! thy face burns on me, and thy heart Turns meward. First for joy's own sake I weep; And then a pang strikes through me wild and deep,— A deathly wintry pallid icy dart: For I can give thee nought but love, my own; Love, love,—and love again,—and love alone. SONNET XIV LOVE AND SYMPATHY Is not love sweeter in that we have dared To look upon the very face of death? That we have trembled at his icy breath Yet have not faltered, but have bravely shared With him the chaplets laughing love prepared When life was like one ever-fragrant wreath?— Is love not sweeter in that underneath Lurks the grim eyeless terror, serpent-haired? Is love not sweeter when two souls have said, “Yes: let us know the worst that can be known.” Oh, if love cannot hurl death from his throne Still love can pluck his crown from off his head. Unloved, unloving,—thus to join the dead— This turns the passionate human heart to stone. SONNET XV “THE GREY DAWN” And yet if thou dost meet it not alone, That weird grey morning over mountains blue May be more sweet than thy soul ever knew Or dreamed,—and lovelier than has yet been shown To heart of poet which with pang and groan Has struggled from old pain to suffering new. When that last awful “grey dawn” thrills us through Shall love not speak with mastering trumpet-tone? Shall love not turn the “grey dawn” into gold And touch the mountain-summits as with fire, Uplifting from each peak and rocky spire The vestments of the morning, fold by fold? May not death's tide of pure delight flow higher Than living heart hath dreamed or tongue hath told? SONNET XVI “PERHAPS ONE LOVE UNITES ALL” Yes: there are many loves.—The love that dreams Of flowers and songs, and weaves within its hair Leaves fresh from dalliance with youth's mountain-air And blossoms dainty from the morning's streams. Love too that mixes with the pale moonbeams Its mystic tresses. Passion swift and rare: Love even than the rose's kiss more fair; Love whose young heart with wildest fancy teems. But fairer and more beautiful than these Is just the love that by its very soul Swears that from starting till the final goal Shines like white marble through the cypress trees There shall be sympathy divine and deep, From love's first waking,—till love falls asleep. SONNET XVII “AND NOW THE SAD THOUGHT” And now the sad thought fills my heart with tears And stills my very singing for awhile.— When love is born, the farthest white clouds smile And fragrance wafted from remotest years Greets us, and all June's chanting fills our ears. We linger, as one lingers on a stile 'Tween meadow and meadow. Flowers so fair beguile Our fancy that it hath no room for fears. When love is born, the farthest star-lips sing And music fills the temples of the sky. Who dreams of Winter when the green-clad Spring With white hand full of primroses is nigh? Dear heart, when love's hand strikes his first harp-string How can we bear to think that love must die! SONNET XVIII “IF I DIE FIRST” If I die first, I would unbar the tomb And fill its gateways full of flowers for thee If such a gift in mortal love might be: I'd make for thee the iron meadows bloom And scatter with my wingéd songs the gloom That now pervades and chills eternity. I'd touch to blue the sable-crested sea Whose waves through night's dark arches peer and loom. But if no longing may give love the power To ope death's gateways for another soul I would leave with thee these few songs in flower That, when my feet have passed the songless goal, Death who would rush with harsh tread through thy bower Destroying part, may not destroy the whole. SONNET XIX “JUST ONE STAR” I would give of my being unto thee, As God gave of himself with love supreme And filled the bright world with his every dream And made his thought incarnate in the sea And in the blossom of the red may-tree And in the tropic mystic white moon-gleam And in the lily floating on the stream And in the passions of humanity. So I would in my humbler measure bring: Not having all the suns and stars to take Wherewith thy spirit's fiery thirst to slake As slakes creation's thirst creation's king— But having just the power to love and sing And just one star to bring thee for love's sake. SONNET XX “REST AT LAST” Renew me with thy being.—I would take Thy young sweet soul and press it close to mine. I would make all my stormy yearning thine And in thine heart mine endless longing slake; Just as the mountain in the mountain-lake Sees its own thunder-crowned fierce image shine And in the blue depth doth itself outline, And ceases then with lonely pain to ache. Give me thyself.—Do I not sorely need —I who have fought for years amid the dust Of trampling hoofs, and parried stroke and thrust, And snapped the spear of sorrow like a reed— Do I not need thee sorely? Strife is past. Love me, and loving, give me rest at last. THE DEEP LOVE One has to count the cost.—One cannot win love's sweetness, One cannot grasp fair love in absolute completeness Without the pain as well. The sweetest flowers are those which grow not on the mountains But at the solemn edge, and sprinkled by the fountains, Of pain's dim red unfathomable hell. Oh, not the common love is sweetest, but the passion Which bindeth soul to soul in mystic sacred fashion In spite of adverse things. Without pursuit could love exult in priceless capture? No soul can know love's deep immeasurable rapture And yet forego the pain the deep love brings. Feb. 25, 1884. WITHOUT AND WITHIN SONNET Iron outside.—To face the world and fate Strength as of finely-woven subtle steel. Strength which can conquer time and never kneel Till the last foe has passed outside the gate. Strength as of iron to encounter hate And snap the arrows of the world piecemeal. A strong brave heart that in no wise doth feel The shock of spears that strike the blue breast-plate. Beneath the breast-plate? Silk and tender folds.— Beneath the tender folds? A most white gleam. A heart that follows after dream on dream Of love, and measureless pure sweetness holds.— Iron outside,—to meet the world. Within? The sweetest living soul for love to win. Jan. 24, 1884. AUTUMN VOICES: SONNETS AND LYRICS (1883) I. SEVEN YEARS AGO In this same spot seven years ago the love-god found me And with a wayward wreath of trivial sweet flowers crowned me,— Seven wild long years ago. In this same spot to-day a tender new love finds me And here again the sweet and wayward love-god binds me (Though love's bonds melt like snow!) Ah! ever so it is. For ever and for ever The love-god haunts our steps, and yet his chains are never Abiding and supreme. Love's breath is as the breath of summer's countless roses: Yet when the sweet long month of sunlit gardens closes All rose-scent is a dream. Seven years and then a love; and then it may be another; Till the last strange-eyed love who hath for very brother The dark-eyed god of death. Seven years! That love should last so long is surely stranger Than that, in spite of past love-pain and passionate danger, A new love should draw breath. Dark eyes my new love hath. Dark eyes and full of dreaming Mine old love had. New dreams and very sweet are gleaming In this girl's eyes to-day.— Ah! twenty years ago the wanton wild sea-surges Laughed as to-day. The wind to-day with wet wings urges The white forgetful spray. Star passes star. Yet each gave birth to love and glory.— The very locks of Time grow scantier now and hoary. Yet, when Time's hair was gold And when Time's limbs were young, Love laughed amid the flowers And sang amid the woods, and frolicked through the bowers, And still Love is not old. Where Nero walked, to-day the Roman maiden tarries And puts aside the flowers her sunburnt soft hand carries And gazes down the street. The walls that oft of old watched old-world deeds with tragic Mute eyes, see still the deeds of love, and hear the magic Strange echo of love's feet. So it goes on.—To-day thine eyes are dark and tender. But, seven years hence, who knows what starry love and splendour Of passion they may see? The love that flies is sweet. The love that stays is sweeter. But both have ready wings, and every love is fleeter Than its own ecstasy. The very stars are winged. Their bright plumes flutter o'er us: They flaunt their golden shields and golden spears before us: But these too fade and fall.— Love is the key of life. A woman's kiss containeth The secret power whereby strong history's grim god reigneth. “Mysteries?”—The kiss of woman solveth all. II. TO ? AND P. B. M. To thee, fair love of mine, I used to read my verses. But now of all Time's blows by far the bitterest curse is That thou art far away. But still God sends a friend. Thanks past all thanks I owe him, Who has given his kindly heed to many a song and poem By many a night and day. Love, thou didst wear a crown of many-coloured flowers: But he has gathered bays from the immortal bowers Where song's god reigns supreme. I thank God from my heart that I have had two hearers: If these, and these alone, for joy's and sorrow's sharers, My life, though dreary, is not all a dream. III. ON READING “WIND-VOICES,” BY PHILIP BOURKE MARSTON “Wind-voices!” Yes: the wind's own voice is here, The voice of every wind;—the voice that goes Straight to the soft heart of the listening rose; The voice that makes the seamen quake for fear When the grim angry white-lipped reefs rise sheer To leeward; and the voice that love's heart knows When on the summer breeze a whisper grows Yet more intense, more passionately clear. Here is the thunder of the wind at sea, And echo of the voice of passion's storm, And loving message of the gentle warm West Wind,—and here the North Wind's revelry: And here the voice that makes the midnight strong With love's despair transfigured into song. IV. TO P. B. M. When the sweet golden unforeseen surprise Of the eternal morning on thee breaks And sudden ripples from the large light-lakes Flood with swift brilliance thine awaking eyes,— When the old weary dream of sorrow dies For ever, and thy soul its pathway takes Through regions where the heart of poet aches No longer, nor the heart of lover sighs:— Then, women thou hast loved will first await Thy coming; I will stand aside for these. But when their forms have passed outside the gate To greet thee on the outer terraces, That foremost greeting finished, then let none Than my soul sooner, see thee see the sun. V. ? “Waits till the ship already in sight be free To bear him back to his far natal shore,— Back through the darkness and the awful sea.” —Philip Bourke Marston Yes, this is our reward.—Not life's fair dreams, But the new-wakened and majestic sense That after silent years of pain intense Light, marvellous light, behind the hill-top gleams. Not by life's pleasant blossom-bordered streams To find our long-delayed large recompence, But in soul-thrilling joy that through the dense Dark worldly clogging air with golden beams Darts on a sudden downward:—the wild hope That not much longer shall this pain endure,— This agony of fierce desire to cope With all love's foes in wrestle close and sure; That Fate shall free, ere long, our long-leashed breath For the great charge along the slopes of death. VI. TO P. B. M. IN MID-STREAM Not to the placid heights of middle age Let you and me with loitering steps ascend. Nay, let us perish in the strife, O friend, Where round the standard most the war-waves rage If this be life—to move from stage to stage And watch life's passion dwindle till the end And slowly all our power of love expend, Life then is poorer for each added page. Nay! If our love and passion may not grow And all the fire within our spirits gleam With steadier, stronger, and diviner glow Daily, mere living is a soulless dream.— Love ever. Perish, if it must be so. But perish buffeting the sweet mid-stream. VII. THE LIGHT OF BATTLE, AND THE LIGHT OF LOVE The light of battle and the light that gleams From woman's eyes—these are the rays divine That on the passionate heart of manhood shine And fill life's highways with tempestuous dreams. The sweetest light of all is that which streams Along the glistening bayonets' serried line When, just now, under growth of rose or pine Love lightened forth:—how close the memory seems! Love in the heart, and the strong sword in hand: The old Elizabethan bards loved so. The heart of manhood has waxed faint and slow To-day, and blood has left our thin-veined land, And men have lost the power to understand How through love's eyes the war-god's glances glow. VIII. AN IDEAL POET Take Marlowe's splendid and impassioned heart, Full of divine Elizabethan fire: Take Shelley's tenderness, and Shelley's lyre, And touch dim heights wherethrough strange starbeams dart: Take Hugo's sovereign love and sense of Art, And Musset's sweet insatiable desire, And Byron's wrath at king and priest and liar— These diverse gifts to one swift soul impart:— Then over and above these several powers Add Christ's own changeless spirit of love for men; Mix Shelley's love for stars and birds and flowers With Christ's unfathomed and immortal pain,— With some such mingling of yet unmixed hours Shall poets of the future sing and reign. A HYMN OF IMMORTALITY I So many have gone before that now the further valleys Are far more full of flowers and songs than sunlit alleys Of earth's green woods forlorn.— The hills of heaven resound to many a dead love's laughter:— So many loves have gone! Shall we not hasten after? So many loves are dead,—dead, or new-born! II Oh, surely heaven is full of sweet familiar faces, And hyacinths are there and ferns from forest-places That here we know so well! So many flowers have died, since first the pain of living Smote through our souls. Our world has been so great at giving. Heaven must be sumptuous with our pine-woods' smell! III So many have gone before! The blossoms of all summers: The leaves of every spring: the bees, those gay-coat mummers: The gilded butterflies.— Our generous earth has given so freely of its splendour That all the shores of heaven must be fulfilled of tender Light shed from sunlit and from moonlit skies! IV Heaven has the best of us! God steals our fairest faces. Heaven envies earth, it seems, her passionate embraces, And even her thymy hills, And even the banks where bloom the violets pure and lowly And where the green fern-fronds unwind their tresses slowly, And even the soft low laughter of our rills. V God! is thine heaven devoid of children that thou takest Ours? Is thine heaven devoid of passion that thou breakest Our love-cups one by one? God! is thine heaven devoid of starlight that thou stealest Each morning all the stars,—of light since thou concealest After earth's every sunset earth's own sun? VI So many have gone before,—bright petals, wings, and faces,— That flowerless, loveless, dry, the old green flowerful places Seem dead for evermore. Yea: heaven it is which holds, as earth held once, our treasures. We started first from heaven, and now our bark remeasures The lonely waters to the primal shore. VII Earth we have tried: which lay before us like an island Divine 'mid waters blue and bright with mist-clad highland Beneath the morning sun. Earth we have tried; and tried the love-lips of its daughters, And stooped our lips to drink its silvery running waters: And now we are weary,—and our task is done. VIII Now in the evening glow that falleth strange and solemn Across the waters grey and lights the last tree-column On the old isle of Earth, With hearts too full to speak, with longings unavailing Towards deathland whence we came, or birthland, we are sailing— But not now round us rings the morning's mirth. IX Not now around us shine the love-looks that we cherished! How many and many a friend in earth's green vales has perished, Exploring through the day The hills and nooks and dells that seemed so fair and harmless. Full of young strength we came: but strengthless now and armless We travel backward through the lonely grey. X How solemn and how weird, over the silent water, That far-lit fir-clump gleams! There kissed we an earth-daughter (How many years ago?) That far blue lonely hill rang once with shouts so merry That the birds glanced aside from threatened husk or berry To wonder what could move man's laughter so! XI Beside that hazel-copse shone eyes so sweet and fearless That for their sake it seemed the whole world must be tearless For ever and evermore! Where are those eyes to-day? Ah! not on board our vessel. Gaze backward, as the keel with onward waves doth wrestle: Mark you that white stone on the sunless shore? XII Within that forest sleeps another and another. A child within that glade: a grey-haired well-loved mother Within those garden-walls. Across the foam-flecked deep their dim eyes seem to glisten: But dimmer are our eyes, as our strained ears would listen To every voice whose old soft whisper calls. XIII Their spirits have crossed the deep before us. As we follow, Obscurer grow the earth's green glades and very hollow Her old love-laughter rings! Oh not behind,—in front the white hands wait and beckon:— The welcoming looks upon death's stately shores we reckon By the tombstones of summers and past springs. XIV The earth fades out of sight. We cross the cold grey water, Almost alone at last.—Flower-son and blossom-daughter, Flower-wife and mother-flower, Not these are with us now. They all have passed before us. For our death-psalm we have the white waves' sobbing chorus: Salt air and moonlight for our last love-bower. XV But oh how full is death, or heaven, of friendly faces! More full of joyous bloom than ever the old green places In the earth's old best days were Are those wan shores whose peaks now just begin to waver In the wild light of dawn: whence unknown blossom-savour Floats towards us faintly through the blue night-air.

      <field name="fulltext">Vol. V: LOVED BEYOND WORDS 1882–1885 LOVED BEYOND WORDS I. LOVE'S OFFERING I offer this to God,—and then to thee,— Then to the world: that God and man may know Love's sweetness and love's blessing and love's woe As each in turn possessed and vanquished me. Then, lastly, back I come—as from the sea To some fair valley with gold flowers aglow; Longing to find thee,—where blue waters flow, And where the bird's song mixes with the bee. Back from the ocean of God's heart, and back From the wild tempest-wingéd tides of things, I turn to thee, as towards some flowerlit track Lined with great oaks whose very leafage sings: And then again God's changeless heart I see, Soft now and blossomlike, revealed in thee. June 13, 1883. I. THE RAPTURE OF LOVE This is the rapture of love:—To plunge one's soul in honey,— Yet not one drop to spill: To pass from night to dawn,—from darkness to the sunny Broad belt of light that circles gleaming mount and hill. This is the glory of love: this is the true possession; When the clear soul-eyes meet. When the strong soul leaps forth, at last from Time's oppression Freed,—and first tastes its triumph large and full and sweet. For in the end the Soul is victor, and that only: Though day press hard on day; Though the long path be thick with thorns, and black, and lonely, And all the stars' gold glances turned, for years, away. Yet there shall come a night when armies beyond counting Of stars shall fill the deep Of heaven, the far blue heights surpassing and surmounting And all the dark fields where the soft dream-maidens sleep. And we shall know that souls beyond our mortal scanning Are marshalled on our side: That measureless stout hosts the stars' bright yards are manning: That all the heavens are watching, eager and swift-eyed. Ah! we are not alone. The countless dead are near us: Their warm strong hands we feel. For fifty living souls, ten thousand dead souls hear us And answer with their love our passionate appeal! II. “THE RIGHT TO LOVE” And is not love enough? To give, and give for ever,— As God spreads light of day O'er field and flaming hill and forest green and river And blue soft-laughing bay! To have the right to love. O man, is not that ample? To have the right to wake The soul in woman's eyes: the soul that weak fools trample; The heart that proud fools break. To have the right to give love infinite;—a treasure That cannot pass or fade. What Fate can hinder me from loving beyond measure,— From giving strength and aid? What Fate can e'er forbid the deep soul of its boundless Eternal passionate stores To give, with streams of love that flow, strong, quiet, soundless, Round loveless needy shores? III. “SO MANY STARS HAVE SHONE” So many stars have shone, that all the stars are weary! So many days have passed, that all the days are dreary! So many flowers have bloomed That nought is left of power within the earth to nourish The spots where, gay of old, the green buds used to flourish: Flowers, hearts and souls, are all alike entombed. No more for me white hands shine at the summer casement And beckon and allure, with dreams of sweet embracement: No more swift glances gleam. This arrow is the last. Though other arrows found me And chains of other loves imprisoned me and bound me, They passed at daylight: vanished like a dream. But this love passes not. Ah! lightly I began it. The love-tree's stem was slim: a childish hand might span it: How weak seemed Love's gold dart! Others had flown before: no conquering hand had launched them: As for the wounds they made, a dozen days had stanched them. But this slight arrow-point has reached my heart. Ah! let it there abide. The pain has shown me surely That still my soul can love unspeakably and purely: That still my spirit can ache: That still my heart retains its highest noblest power: That still, as in the days when life was all in flower, Death can seem sweeter,—for a woman's sake. IV. “MORE THAN THESE” The long days stretch in front, and each will bring its greeting:— The flowers and fronds of June—the August breeze,— The green boughs o'er thine head in wild luxuriance meeting,— The rippling waves of far-off summer seas,— These all will greet thee.—I loved thee more than these! I loved thee more than all the world's light host of lovers Can love,—far more than fern or fragrant leas Or fairies peeping through the rustling hazel-covers Or gay-winged butterflies or restless bees.— Ah! more than these I loved thee,—more than these! I loved thee more than those whose tongues may praise and flatter And for a moment thy young fancy please. I have the flowers of love,—but only those,—to scatter; Those flowers of love!—how soon their soft flush flees. How many things thou lovest more than these! Life's hands are full of gifts, and thou art young and ready To trust the tale Life tells of wealth and ease. The storm has risen not yet. Thy harbour-light flames steady. But when the black night shivers through the trees And friends fail, call me.—I love thee more than these. V. NEW LIFE Yes: through me then there passed the power of life immortal. A revelation came Sent straight from heaven's far golden high sun-guarded portal: A revelation sweet and winged with flame. I saw new powers of life within my spirit growing: New pure undreamed-of things Flashed on my sight with plumes all bright and eyes all glowing And new skies' azure gathered in their wings. Sweet as the skies of some unknown blue-sea-girt island,— Fresh as the prospect fair From purple heather-adorned voluptuous scented highland,— Pure as the first breath of Italian air,— Pure, sweet, and fresh as all these things, the vision crowned me Which, maiden, thou didst bring. Is it a wonder then that strange light gleamed around me And gave me for awhile new force to sing? Is it a wonder now that when the vision fadeth My singing sinks to sleep? Silence is surely best when solemn darkness shadeth The golden meadows and the enchanted deep. Yet have I strange eternal deathless recollection Of what the vision gave. Its passionate sense of glad superb love-resurrection Methinks will tarry with me till my grave. And why God takes away I know not,—for so little My spirit asked indeed! Just leave to love and give! Is that to trust a brittle And faithless staff,—to lean upon a reed? Is that to ask too much from Nature's stores unmeasured Where love and life are framed? Because I thought that love ought alway to be treasured Is my deep faith in love to make me ashamed? I saw new life arise as surely as new meadows See new glad springs arise:— As surely as the woods emerge from wintry shadows To meet the soft primroses' laughing eyes! As surely as new hearts when we lie calmly sleeping Will chant love's flower-crowned lays I, dead and buried long, woke: and my heart was weeping Glad soft tears,—and love's sunlight lit the ways. New possibilities of ardent life came thronging Round me on every side. In one short sigh wild grievous centuries of longing Were soothed away. My soul-gaze opened wide. Through room on room I passed of palace after palace And found new joys in each. And ever as I drained some new divine love-chalice A new diviner cup my hand could reach. As surely as the loves of far-off years approaching With untouched fair white hands Will greet new lovers,—sweet and new-born,—not encroaching On the old barren shores and sterile lands: As surely as there wait beneath new suns loves sweeter Than any seen of yore And poems tarry in front of lordlier march and metre, And faces fairer than the old to adore: As surely as the English gold hair makes the Spanish Dark hair more sweet to see: As surely as the scent of thyme will never vanish For countless kisses of the assailant bee:— So did I see new dreams of splendid new life winging Their radiant-hued gold way Around thee, maiden mine,—and brake forth into singing, While through the clouds Apollo led the day. And, if I lose thee now, what of these dreams I wonder? What of next summer's rose? Ah! when the very soul by grief is rent in sunder, What is there left to sing?—God only knows. VI. “ALL OVER LONDON NOW” All over London now as weary and sad I wander Thy face and eyes I meet. Here wast thou; here and here; and there; and here; and yonder;— Thou hast not left one uninvaded street! Here did I meet thee once! Here marvellous words were spoken That thrilled my very heart.— Time paused and watched us, envious. Yet Time gave no token How soon and for how long we were to part! The new spring soon will come with crocus and with swallow And green woods full of song: And then the flowers of May will wake,—the rose will follow, And in the rose's train the blossom-throng! Thou wilt not come with these? Thou wilt not come for calling Though sweet the love-strain be? Thou wilt not come in summer,—or when the leaves are falling And the wild winds and singers seek the sea? Thou wilt not come again,—for ever and for ever? Nor make one London street New and divine as if man's steps had trodden it never But only, just that once, thy maiden feet? Thou wilt not come again,—to make my heart a giant Leaping along life's way? To make it new and young and pure and tender and pliant As if thy touch created love that day? As if when I saw thee that moment dawned the morning O'er primal sea and land. As if the world's white roses waited for the warning Soft glad first touch of thy creative hand! As if my heart was void till thy pure spirit did enter And built its palace there And sat enthroned a queen within its very centre And gave my heart the power new fruit to bear! Yet thou hast come, and herein lies love's chiefest wonder,— That Time has nought to say To Love: that years and years can never sunder From the safe heart the memory of one day. I never see the streets wherethrough we walked together Without a deep soul-sigh. Never,—in autumn days or gorgeous blue June-weather; And so it will be with me till I die. And yet we met some six or seven or eight times merely:— But all the stars are thine, And when the moon shines out above the roof-tops clearly I see thee,—and thine eyes again meet mine. Time is not aught. The world since Jesus' resurrection Has owned him as its Lord: The centuries have bent with giant genuflexion And kings of the earth have yielded crown and sword: And yet his voice was heard some seven or eight times merely After the pale death-pang. Yet through all time it rings of every voice most clearly:— Dead is no singer, if but once he sang. And so the two strange nights when all the stars were lightened Of agelong hunger and grief, And when my soul grew young once more, and cloud-wreaths brightened, And love's heart fluttered like a wind-kissed leaf: The two strange nights when heaven seemed full of hope and bluer And every star more near And every breath of air more sweet,—all poems truer,— And all the soul of womanhood more dear: These are mine own for ever.—Nought can change or take them Till life itself is spent. Can storm-winds move the stars? Can the black tempests shake them? Do they not laugh when the frail heaven is rent? Does God own any change though all the centuries dwindle And shrink before his gaze? Do God's eyes tremble when the eternal firebolts kindle Or when the storm-lashed brown foam piles the bays? No?—So it is with love,—and those two nights of wonder. They sink into the past. Yet when along the sea-line rolls the flagging thunder And all things end, the glory of these shall last. VII. THE INLAND-LOVE AND THE SEA-LOVE The old sweet inland love was mighty of soul and seeming:— Through valleys sweet with flowers its footstep lingered dreaming And ever it laughed and sang. But when the valleys all are trodden and moorland heather Burns round about our path, and winds and waves together Mingle their solemn chant, how large is love and love's last pang. Far-off the valleys seem, and all the inland flowers; Love's tender spring, and love's soft unforgotten bowers Where the early words were said. Upon the cliffs the last great fight is ever wagéd And the red final blades of close-locked swords assuagéd While round about us crowd the strange-eyed hosts of the awful dead. So, though the old loves were sweet, yet in a sense far sweeter Is the last love that links its music-soul to metre With the great waves in sight. For something it hath upon its lips of the sea-laughter And in its eyes the awe and shadow of the hereafter And in its hands the strength of the seas, and on its brow their light. VIII. SURPRISED As one who loves is on a sudden left amazed When the sheer mocking stroke of death descends; As he seems thunder-struck and blind of heart and dazed To think the sword of death was for one moment raised And in that moment, lo! a life's love ends; As he is left alone, wifeless,—yet perhaps a frail Babe still smiles at him with her mother's eyes: So am I left alone and helpless with my pale Babe-poems,—and my love is lost beneath the veil Of pitiless unstormed unanswering skies. And half I hate the poems,—and half I love them well: They have their mother's eyes. Her cradle-song Wherewith she lulled them once as they on slumber fell Sounds through them yet: but now 'tis changed into a knell,— The chant of an irreparable wrong. O poems written when the summer light of skies So sweet and tender round about you gleamed, Are ye then still alive? Pale with a mute surprise I see her likeness still in your brown depths of eyes,— Ah! not so deep as hers of whom ye dreamed. The likeness still is there. And I,—I know not well Whether to throw the poems in the sea, Or give them to the air, or earth, or fiery hell: Yet, if I did, my heart would reproduce their spell, For they are graven on the spirit of me. I know not whether to hate or cherish my pale child, My poem,—having, as it has, her gaze: Whether to cast it forth upon the waters wild: Whether to yield once more and so be reconciled:— Whether to love the poor close-clinging lays! Ah! they are sad indeed. Their eyes are full of tears. They are as full of sorrow as if one saw The roses and the leaves of devastated years Rise suddenly among their new this-summer's peers,— While all the breezes watched with silent awe,— Rise suddenly and claim their place the flowers among. So these sad poems, flowerlike, do not know That she who gave them birth and wrought them into song Will never see them more, or care what hand doth wrong To these her children,—or him who loved her so! IX. OTHER LOVES Yes, there are other loves.—This world is full of flowers. Because to-night is fair, are there no moonlit hours In front? Because to-night Gives thee thy love, are there no loves in other cities? If thou hast sung, is thine the last of all love-ditties? Not woman,—rather womanhood,—is white. Ah! so a man might plead. And yet how hollow a fashion Of thought and word it seems, when once real deep live passion Has risen and set its seal Upon the spirit!—How little I care for next year's roses If my flower-dream of this sweet year in darkness closes And passes far beyond song's wild appeal! Yes, there are other loves. I have no heart to take them.— Yes, there are other flowers. I have no heart to break them From their soft supple stems.— Yes, there are other stars,—and golden moonlight quivers To-night upon green waves of white-bridged Southern rivers; But all my moonlight falls across the Thames. Pass on, ye lovers all. Choose ye your glad hereafter. I follow along the track my dead dream's ghostlike laughter. Pass on, ye suns and stars.— I only know that just one hour sweet Freedom gave me Her light of eyes, and light of soul and heart, to save me; But now I see all light through prison-bars. X. ONE GIRL'S LAUGHTER All men desire,—to make their dower of joy completer And their lives' songs ring out far clearlier yet and sweeter,— Some one forbidden thing. Some long for fame, and some for gold, and some for passion. The linnet, if it could, would robe in peacock-fashion: The peacock's bliss were perfect, could it sing! All things desire, and fail to win their satisfaction. The man whose path is calm longs madly for fierce action And some wild knightly quest. The saint heeds nought on earth, but lives in the hereafter.— And I feel that to hear one girl's clear lovely laughter Would give my weary spirit eternal rest. XI. FOR THEE It is as if my whole past life were but a shadow:— The years till thy foot came Were winter. Spring with thee turned hill and lane and meadow Into one golden sheet of blossom-flame. It is as if the centuries hushed their wings and waited For thee, my sweet, for thee,— And all the silver tidal ripples hesitated And paused to worship, over all the sea! It is as if till this strange year of dread and wonder Never one rosebud blew. It is as if for thee the very march of thunder Halted, and lightning's red lips silent grew. When thou didst come, the blue waves' light-lipped silver laughter Rang echoing round thy road. Spring caught up her green gown, and Summer followed after, And never a stream but far more softly flowed. It is as if the flowers in prehistoric valleys Had waited for thy reign. Now thou art gone, the vales of earth and its green alleys Will never laugh their old light laugh again! The days will come and go,—the flowers will bloom and wither And summers bloom and fade; Spring's glistening wings will pass, and once again turn hither; Darkness will yield to light, and sun to shade; And I shall live and love, and hear of thee, and see thee (Yes: I shall love again!)— But never will my heart for all its journeys flee thee Or quite escape one haunting pain. XII. A CHRISTMAS CARD I A Christmas Card! A small slight common message merely. And yet it makes as though the summer sun shone clearly Across the wintry track Just now so gaunt and black! II A little thing can change the current of our dreaming And change the grey wan waves to azure waters gleaming, Make all our spirits sing; Yes,—just one little thing! III A little thing gives Life. A little thing brings pain. A touch upon the heart,—and song speaks not again. Another touch, and lo! Forth the song-waters flow. IV A thrill along the heart: a kiss upon the cheek: And out the ripples gush,—and the mute cravings speak. Woman can kill or save; Can build or burst a grave. V A glance from eyes to eyes: a pressure of the hand: And flowers fill all the paths, and sunlight fills the land. A woman's word can bring, In mid-December, Spring. VI In mid-December, May; or winter in mid-June: And in the darkest night the magic of full moon. A woman's glance or kiss Can more than compass this! Christmas Day, 1882. XIII. “I PRAISED THE LORD OF LOVE” I I praised the Lord of love who made the world of roses For his own heart to seek: Then gave me one white rose that blossoms and uncloses,— Thy cheek against my cheek! II I praised the Lord who made the soft night fall around me,— Made star-hosts wax and flee: Then, since he needed song, with song's wild passion crowned me,— And with one star-love,—thee! III I praised the Lord who heard the laughter of his daughters And of the leaves o'the pine And of the silver-voiced and multitudinous waters: Then gave me one laugh,—thine! IV I praised the Lord who saw the wild wind like a lover Laughing for very bliss Fondle the dainty heads of countless cliff-top clover: Then gave me thy one kiss! XIV. AT THE LAST When at the last we stand beside the sea's grey water, How passing sweet is then the earth's pale last flower-daughter Who follows to the marge Where yellow sand meets grey wild-crested waves far-gleaming; Who once again sets heart and spirit and brain a-dreaming Of old green forests lit by moonlight large. No flowers are here to love, save this one blossom only Which shines so strange and sweet upon the margin lonely Where at the last we stand: This blossom-spirit who brings the fair old earth's last message, Which mixes with the weird and solemn bodeful presage Of new love wafted from the sea to land. In doubt and awe we stand, and mystic perturbation, And all our nerves are thrilled with dread and expectation: We know not what shall be. Yet this we know,—that sweeter than all old loves' glances Is this the whisper low whose tremulous breath advances From over footless leagues of flowerless sea. Through regions red with rose or white with scented lily Our steps have passed,—from groves umbrageous unto hilly Bare windy sun-struck peaks: Dark eyes indeed we have loved, and river after river Have tracked just out of love for mermaids' arms that quiver Through the blue water and their flushed sweet cheeks. And now at last the sea wide stretches out before us: Far into the murk night recedes the sobbing chorus Of hosts of plashing waves. Is not beyond all loves this last pale love courageous Who for our sake has left the groves and grots umbrageous, And paths that many a tender green leaf paves? Is not this love beyond all loves preceding solemn Who, now the waves advance in white unending column And threaten through the gloom, Still true beside me stands, and gives me thoughts that cheer me Of long-past days when loves innumerable were near me, Both sweet and numberless as white may-bloom? Ambassadress divine, who through thy lips and laughter The earth's last message bring'st, will any love hereafter Have quite the charm for me (If there be loves indeed behind the mystic curtain) That thou hast?—for thy love is earthly, sweet, and certain,— Not like the love-clasp of the uncertain sea. Thou art the messenger who bringest to the portal Of death,—or, it may be, the gate of life immortal,— (So doubtful is the deep!) The farewell words of earth;—the farewell of the willows That sounds so strange amid the treeless plunge of billows; The last voice of the woods where lost dreams sleep: The farewell of the birds; the farewell of the arches Wherethrough the gold sun peeps, and lights the forest-larches To their most tender green; The farewell of the hills and all the blue-haired rivers; The farewell of each reed that by the water quivers; The voice of each spot where love's steps have been: The voices of old loves,—their soft good-bye eternal; The farewell of the leaves, now green-robed, young, and vernal, Autumnal now and red: The voice of all these things, O true last love, thou bringest; With their collective voice beside the sea thou singest,— Thou the one link between the live and dead. So art thou strangely sweet. So is this love intenser Than all the old when flowers and loves and leaves in denser Gay squadrons shone around. For now thou hast no lute, and I have never a poem: We have no power to pay King Love the chant we owe him Save only with the waves' untuneful sound. If thou dost travel back, tell all the flowers and faces Of old loves in the woods and all remembered places That all my love was true. Take my farewell to all: to every river-valley And forest where the sweet hyacinthine armies rally And flaunt their banners of empyreal blue. If thou dost travel back. But wilt thou travel forward? Wilt thou with me forego the journey backward, shoreward, And tempt the deep with me? Wilt thou, when all is dark and all is very lonely, Be on this awful waste the one white flower,—the only Angel of life upon the death-black sea? XV. RESURRECTION Oh joy past words indeed, delight superbly fashioned, That in the groves of heaven will speak with voice impassioned, When, after thou hadst died I thought and passed away for ever in mortal seeming, I found myself one night in golden May a-dreaming My sweet old golden love-dream by thy side! It was as sweet as if the May-month had arisen New-born, new-decked indeed, from some sad darksome prison And brought all dead rose-bloom Of perished former Mays within its white hands yearning Over the tender white and red soft rosebuds burning Alive and splendid through their prison gloom. It was most sweet to find that May can still remember The flowers and wreaths and songs of mist-wreathed pale September And bring them back again:— Most sweet to see again heaven's hills and May-green larches After the flowerless walls of hell and flowerless arches Of the grim wintry dungeon-deeps of pain. And will the fair dream pass? I know not. One thing knowing, I meet with gladdened lips the lips of May soft-glowing And tender and pure and red: This knowing,—that I to-day am strong who once was weary; Free who once watched the sun through prison-grating dreary; Alive to-day, who yesterday was dead. May 2, 1883. XVI. THE POET'S DEATH-GIFT We have loved too much.—The sun is blamed who loves the flowers And pierces deep within the tangled hawthorn-bowers And lights with loving glee The green grass-depths. The moon is blamed who casts her brightness Not over one but over all the white waves' whiteness And kisses all the foam-bells on the sea. O ye who love in small and common fickle fashion What know ye of the intense immeasurable passion That through the poet flows And, if it could, would bring—even by its death—deep pleasure To those it loves,—as God who loves beyond all measure Tinges with his own blood the blood-red rose? So would the poet die for those he loves to bring them New sweet immortal bloom. He would do more than sing them As God did more than make The world.—The poet loves. Yet who believes or heedeth? Who understands his heart that wrestles in love and bleedeth And loveth on and on, though nigh to break? A man may love too much. What rose of all the roses When at the morning's glance her sweetness she uncloses And blushes being fair Knows that it took a God's death-pain to bring the brightness Into her blood-red leaves that else had paled in whiteness, Ashamed before the morning's golden hair? What woman is there yet to understand or know it,— That he the man she deems a careless light-heart poet Loving where'er he wills Has given his very life for some: though they shall never Know all until the Last Day's fiery lightnings sever The earth's foundations and the tossing hills. What if they never had bloomed—though they may never know it!— But for the long death-pang and love-pang of the poet? What if (as God to the rose) He gave his very life in anguish-throbs exceeding For them? What if their bloom be his slow deadly bleeding And all their beauty his death-gift? Who knows? XVII. “THOU KNOWEST NOT NOW” I My love “thou knowest not now,—but thou shalt know hereafter” Why I would give my life to give thy silver laughter A yet more silvery tone. Why I would die to call thee (—as I may not ever—) Beyond all days that part and black-winged nights that sever My own. II Thou knowest not why I love; nor canst thou ever know it On this side of the grave. I, a sad world-worn poet, Stand by death's ocean-deep, And lo! thy bright eyes gaze upon me and they blind me And I who had to death inexorable resigned me Can weep. III Perchance in days to come,—far days of which we dream not,— When all is dark around and passion's bright stars gleam not Nor youth's stars upon thee I may be able—then—to tell thee why the morning At thine approach blushed red and smote without one warning The sea. IV I may be able—then—to tell thee why romances Long dead and buried deep rose up at thy dark glances Alive as ever of old: And why the far fields flamed one living sheet of flowers And why the buttercups lent glad thought's summer hours Their gold! V But now I may not speak, save only in mystic metre,— And may not tell thee, love, why thou to me art sweeter Than any words could tell. Why is the grass-blade sweet that shines like some mute warder Just on the parched-up grim intolerable border Of hell? VI I may not speak or act. Nay! hardly may I love thee. I may not send a song to turn thy heart or move thee. Yet this one thing I may; Each morn and every night thank God that I have seen thee And plead that Love's strong arms may fold around and screen thee Each night and day. XVIII. THE DEATH OF TYRANNY All tyrannies shall pass.—The tyranny of winter That clothes with snow and frost and pitiless ice-splinter The blossomless may-tree. The tyranny that strips of leaves the greenwood cover: The tyranny that parts the loved one from the lover; That keeps the imprisoned sea-bird from the sea. The tyranny that holds our eyes and hearts in prison In dark-green leafy woods when God has just arisen In sunlight o'er the waves: The tyranny that holds vast nations pent in bondage; That changes to blood-red the agonized green frondage And changes bridal-beds to brideless graves. The tyranny of man o'er woman, and of pleasure Over the Soul that strives with suffering past all measure To arise and stand upright: The tyranny that sends the songless days and flowerless And hurls the darts of pain upon us, speechless, powerless, After our sojourn in love's vast sweet light. All tyrannies shall end. Of kings and lusts and liars And sorrow and evil hours and thorns that on the briars Startle the roses' breath: And last of all shall end the power of him who waiteth Alert, unconquered yet, when all force else abateth,— The agelong hell-deep Monarchy of Death. XIX. THE INEVITABLE END On one side youth and beauty infinite And on the other weariness extreme Of life and life's long spirit-torturing dream And of the vain wild search for vain delight. On one side eyes the sun's own glance made bright But on the other eyes through which there gleam The eyes of sorrows numberless,—no beam Of sun being there by day, nor moon by night. When this is so, could any end but one Be reached,—could either flee the certain goal, This—that the weary night should love the sun; That all my heart should by thy glance be won; That I should love thee, spirit calm and white, With all the stormy dark strength of my soul? XX. MY PRAYER This is my prayer each day: not that the flowers should love me, Nor further skies of June gleam bountiful above me, Nor further seas gleam blue,— Not that the scent of may may fill once more the hedges And scent of gracious thyme the balmy river-ledges,— But that once more my eyes may look on you! This is my prayer each day, each night; that God will let me, O loved past poet's speech, before you quite forget me, Just see you,—once draw nigh. And then when we have met, and once again are parted, The same cry goes to God from me half broken-hearted,— “God! let me see her again before I die!” XXI. SONG I Yes, the white meadow-sweet is fair, With fronds upon the June-breeze shaking,— And sweet the sumptuous summer air The reeds and tossing branches taking, And sweet the sound of birds awaking, And sweet the whisper on the shore Of small white-crested clear waves breaking:— But all the glory of these is o'er If I may hear your voice no more,—O love, no more! II Once loves were many as the flowers Upon the wind their petals flinging; Soft voices silvery in the bowers That then were full of youth's wild singing: But now life's autumn leaves are clinging To branches brown and sad and dry That once with throstles' notes were ringing:— If this last love must wither and die There are no other loves beneath the darkening sky. XXII. HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND? How can you ever, ever, understand? How can I tell you what you are to me?— More than the snow-white sea-bird to the sea! More than the sweetest white rose to the land! I see you,—gaze upon you,—touch your hand; Yet what is that to love's infinity? What is the little ocean-space we see To ocean-wastes by rainbow-arches spanned? How can I tell you anything at all? You with the great brown gentle birdlike eyes! Why should you answer at a lover's call,— You whose true lovers are the stars and skies? What can I do, O loved one, for your sake Save only just to let my whole heart break? XXIII. “IF I COULD DO SOME GREAT HIGH THING FOR THEE” If I could do some great high thing for thee As Christ did for the world,—could slowly bleed To death that thou mightst gladdened be or freed,— If I could change my heart-throbs to a sea And every wave of life thy wave might be And every act of life a loving deed And every word a prayer to intercede,— I should be then content eternally. But I can do so little: just a song, A wreath of words, I bring thee,—when I pine To crown thee with my very being's breath. Some music here and there in just a line Of verse or two I bring thee when I long To give thee love so deep it mocks at death. XXIV. “IF I MUST EVER CEASE” If I must ever cease this tide of passionate dreaming,— If there should come a day when never more the gleaming Of thy star-eyes may be,— If I lose by the banks of very death's dark river Thee my last hope of all, and watch with ghastly shiver All sunlight fade out of the air and sea:— If I must lose thee—thee my flower so pure and tender Who gatherest into one all past bright blossoms' splendour— If I must give up thee,— Why then all prayer must cease, save only this one bitter Wild cry—could any wild heart-broken words be fitter?— “God help me,—and have mercy upon me!” XXV. “HOW COULD I HELP IT?’ How could I help it?—Climbing out of hell, Can one refuse to love the flower that grows Close by the hell-brink? Is not the first rose One sees in a green hedge adorable?— So sweetness more than I can ever tell Crowns thee, and round about thy being flows. My love is measured by my former throes Of pain: the light by darkness visible. It is not much I ask. Pay love's old debt With this, Lord God. I only ask to see This woman's face: that it may shine on me From time to time: that this star may not set:— That I may look, for many a sweet day yet, Loving, on her, who have, fearless, looked on thee. XXVI. THIS ONE THING I have not feared hell's fires, nor feared the pang Of bitterest suffering, if so I might hear Her bright girl-laughter ringing silver-clear As on the day when first we met it rang. Wilt thou take from me now this one thing dear And hush the bird that at my window sang So sweetly that her note outsoared the clang Of prison-labour torturing mine ear? Oh not this one thing?—Take not from the sea The morning's vast unutterable light! Take not the first nor last star from the night! Take not this tender star-love, God, from me! Stay not the swallow in her Southern flight Nor my wings seeking love's deep purity. XXVII. BECAUSE Because I looked into the eyes of pain Fearless,—and into thine eyes when the sword Of punishment was in thine hand, O Lord; Yea, bade thee smite me often and again If so I might re-enter the old fane Of love, and thus escape the ghastly horde Of sins and passions loathsome and abhorred That surge around me with their mocking strain:— Because I did not dread thine awful eyes When there was anger in them and the fire Of a strong God's invincible desire And in thine hand the thunders of the skies,— Let me now watch this woman's eyes instead And touch her white hand for thine own dyed red. XXVIII. ONE JUNE-DAY O Love that hast within thy kingly store Junes numberless, and canst bestow their bloom Just where thou willest, raising from their tomb The flower-white ghosts of Junes that came before And June-sweet ghosts of flowers that died of yore,— Filling green aisles of gardens with perfume And spectral blossom-wings that through the gloom Sail, flinging marvel round them as they soar:— O Love that hast within thy kingly hand All dead June-days and perfect Junes to be, Wilt thou not spare one sweet June-day to me, And let my gentle love beside me stand While step by step the shifting hour-glass' sand Gives air and bloom and sunlight back to thee? XXIX. TIMELESS WOE If thou shouldst ever sin, O flower of mine, And mar the whiteness that I worship so, Great tides of sorrow would throughout me flow; Yea, I should marvel at that deed of thine As at some solemn desecrated shrine Where once the steps of pilgrims used to go. Thy fall would work me such exceeding woe That in one giant glimpse I should divine With an unearthly horror past all speech The giant agony that drew God down And made him sternly cast aside his crown The sin and suffering of the earth to reach. God help me then,—for then I might impeach God's justice, and Love's whole long toil disown! XXX. THE LOVE-SONG OF THE SEA Thou hast so little share or part in me And that, God knows, is why I love thee so! Just as the great white waves that shoreward go After their journey o'er the bitter sea Love past all speech the emerald-shining lea And the blue river-waves that towards them flow,— And love beyond all human words the glow Of pink cliff-thyme, and singing of the bee. Thou art the river bringing to the deep Thoughts of the flowers that by its banks are seen, Woven in white amid the entangled green,— Dreams of the meadows where the daisies sleep. But what gifts, loved one, can I give to thee? Only the love-song of the restless sea! XXXI. SONG'S INSUFFICIENCY I cannot tell thee why I love thee so, Or how I love thee. Can the black night tell The star that lights its heart wherein is hell Why past all passion it adores the glow That shoots its golden sweet rays to and fro Across its murky depths unfathomable? Can the dark water in the hollow well, Star-holding, praise the star that stoops so low?— The night is silent, and the dark deep disk Of water in the well is silent too. Nor is there much that even Song can do: All words are open to the endless risk That she who hears the words may fail to hear The actual true heart sighing at her ear. XXXII. WORDLESS I cannot tell thee, love, how utterly I love thee! But may the skies of night bend tenderly above thee And whisper in thine ear, And may the flowers of June bring thee some word of greeting And every sacred star a swift kiss, sweet if fleeting: May the soft June-night bear love's message, dear! The message of the flowers is sweet and very tender, And gracious are the stars in all their golden splendour, Ready their joy to impart. But none of all these things,—thou knowest it, God above us,— Not star nor flower nor night, though each of these may love us, Could speak the full love of my throbbing heart. XXXIII. THE GIFTLESS DAYS The days whereon I bring no gifts to thee Seem wasted days; like days wherethrough there blows No soft wind laden with the scent of rose, But only salt strange vapours from the sea. All gifts I give thee are sweet gifts to me: When I bring no gift, not mine own heart knows The stream of strong despair that through it flows, For it transcends all measuring potency. It is my grief that I can give no more. When God had given its crown of stars to night And to the sea its awful robe of white And golden raiment to the glittering shore, What then was left? This only:—to deplore That no new gifts could give God new delight. XXXIV. JUST ONCE If we must part—though the mere sound of this Is horror to me—oh remember then Of all the thronging clamorous crowd of men I loved thee best who never won thy kiss. The choking strange sweet suffocating bliss It is to me to see thee, and the pain Beyond all words when thou art hidden again,— These show my soul how fierce a king Love is. O Love, strong Love, who hast within thy hand Not pleasures only, but a keen-edged sword,— Who art the whole world's pitiless great lord, Lord of the snow-clad and the rose-clad land,— Give her, just once, the heart to understand My heart before her utterly outpoured! XXXV. THE FLOWER AND THE NIGHT The flower for but one night of rapture born Said to the night: “New flowers and nights will be, But I shall never look again on thee; Meet now my flower-gaze fully, without scorn. To-morrow night thou wilt not be forlorn, For flowers and stars to all eternity Within thy fragrant wide arms thou shalt see:— New loves will rise, as each from thee is torn. “But this one hour I hold thee, sacred night.”— As said the flower, I murmur, love, to thee. This once thy dark eyes and dark hair I see, And with unknown unfathomable delight Watch the slow fragrant soft hours wing their flight,— While each hour's pulse involves eternity. XXXVI. TOO HARD TO BEAR When I think sometimes that for years and years New springs may clothe the hills in mocking green And new blue skies with their high azure sheen Gladden the hearts of men,—and that men's ears May mark new love-songs woven of joy and tears And all things else be just as they have been Save only that thou art not here, my queen,— I tremble with interminable fears. That I should lose thee—thee my one delight, While God keeps crowds of throstles at his ear,— Thee my one lily, while God's lilies white Are numberless and sweet and ever near His throne,—my one star, while he has the night Of stars,—great God, this seems too hard to bear! XXXVII. FOR THEE AND ME The charm and beauty of this world of things And all the sunlight of the summer sea And sweetest notes of every bird that sings For thee!— The dark night's sombre face and starless wings For me! A future of delight and all men's praise And laughter ringing out like love's own glee And happy walks in radiant rose-hung ways For thee!— A leaf or two of dark blood-spotted bays For me! Bright flowers upon the river-banks, and all God's love made manifest in bird and bee; Joy ever close at hand whereon to call For thee!— Sorrow that shrouds the wide world like a pall For me! Life and the gifts of life,—its fairest flowers To gather, and its fairest sights to see; Its tenderest avenues and deepest bowers For thee!— A lonely watch beside thy gate for hours For me! A glance or two that haunt me evermore, That tarry yet though all things else may flee; The memory of thy sweet face to adore For me!— My whole soul's love till life and death are o'er For thee! XXXVIII. O FACE! Lift me by thy strange beauty evermore And gift me nobly as with God's own grace And give me holiest wings whereon to soar, O face! There never yet on loveliest hill or shore, In old-world lands, or fair undreamed-of place, Shone beauty such as thine for man to adore, O face! Love-gifts round Helen all men came to pour; The strong world maddened for her white embrace: Beauty past speech she had; yet thou hast more, O face! I never dreamed till half my life was o'er That beauty such as thine God's hand could trace. Nor was such beauty moulded ever of yore, O face! Lift me to lands where Beauty evermore Is one with Love, and Love is one with grace. Let me with all my strength of soul adore, O face! XXXIX. IS IT ALL IN VAIN? Is my strong holy passionate love for thee Just a thing wasted? Are all prayers in vain? Or do they some high heavenly summit gain Whence their fruition they shall one day see? Is it worth nought with holy purity And desperate throes of a Titanic pain Ever at Love's high altar to remain Watching, though all men smile in mockery?— Does God who cares for flowers, and smooths the wings Of his storm-crumpled dainty butterflies, Care nought for Prayer's torn plumage when it tries To part the thunder-clouds whose purple rings Hem in and guard his palace in the skies?— Can subjects gain the ear of the King of kings? XL. A BLIND MAN'S AGONY A blind man's agony who sees no more The gorgeous plumage of the summer day, Nor the young blue waves splashing with light spray The golden sand on the receding shore, Nor butterflies who steer with feathered oar Through flower on flower, or thread their dainty way Through branch on green branch,—nor the moonlit bay, Nor ardent wings wherewith the sun's steeds soar:— The agony that grasps with one vast pang That all these things prevail outside his brain, Yet that their light will enter not again Now once the gates of iron darkness clang, Is like my pain O sun, O love, O sea, Dreading lest I may look no more on thee. XLI. LOVE'S LONGING Lo! I would give my utter self to thee:— As God was not content to give the rose The every tint wherewith its bright heart glows, Nor to bestow its whiteness on the sea, Nor robe of summer verdure on the tree, Nor on the mountain-steep its awful snows, Nor on the night its fathomless repose Wherethrough the stars' wings sweep eternally;— As God was not content to give to these Sweet gifts and many—to the flower its bloom,— Its tender moss-wreath to the granite tomb,— Its voice of silver to the singing breeze— But must do more; must the world's ransom be, Hanging upon the Cross of Calvary. XLII. SAFE Is the rose safe within its sheath of leaves? The sea-bird safe upon the crest of foam? Is the fern safe within its forest-home? Is the gold corn-ear safe amid the sheaves? Are the blue swallows safe beneath the eaves? Is the star safe within the darkling dome Of night? However far the wild winds roam, Is there an eye which follows and perceives?— These things are safe? Then thou art safe with me. Safe as the pale star clinging to the night: Safe as the sea-gull's breast of plumy white Upon the waters that uprise and flee: Safe as the lamb Christ folds within his bright Calm breast is safe for all eternity. XLIII. THE DEADLIEST PANG Was there a thought in God's heart when he died Upon the Cross, that all might be in vain? That after all his immemorial pain The mocking world his love-suit might deride? That she might nestle by another's side,— That other feet love's temple might profane, And other hearts of little worth might gain The poor frail doubting faint heart of his Bride?— Was this, and nothing else, the death-pang true, The awful darkness darkening sea and land? To give without reserve; although he knew Whose blow would drive the last nail through his hand.— It took one little hour to pierce Love through: It takes the world all time to understand. XLIV. A FINAL BLESSING May God who guards the flowers and all the wildwood places And tints with red the sea-weeds in the sea,— May God who folds the skies in his superb embraces Have still more heed of thee! The power of man is slight: I cannot guard or follow: Where thy steps fall, often, I may not be. But on the mountain-steep, or in the daisied hollow, May God's love circle thee! May somewhat of my love pass into God, and find thee And watch thy footsteps though I may not see: May my love and God's love be guardian fire behind thee And flame in front of thee! May God's love and my love be ever round about thee As the dense thronging soft leaves guard the tree: A hallowing light within, a saving shield without thee; May our love follow thee! God loves the stars and winds and all frail human creatures: He sends them sorrow and he sends them glee. Shall he not love as I thy sweet love-breathing features? Past all love, wonder at thee? I wonder and I love: and God himself who made thee Must wonder, as deep wonder thrills through me. Must stoop himself from heaven with veil of clouds to shade thee: Must long to die for thee. Oh, this I envy God,—that he so far above thee Can pour out blessings till all pain shall flee: While I, O love of mine, can only, only, love thee, Can only die for thee. In this I envy God,—that he can send heaven's flowers And all heaven's gifts from heavenly grove and lea: Blossoms of passionate love from his strange starlit bowers: I—but one song to thee. Yet can God love thee more? Has not my love created The very love wherewith God loveth thee? Hath not God's love for thee in mine originated? Did God not learn from me? Ah! surely I learnt from God: and therefore God must love thee More even than I (Great God, can this thing be!)— Must yearn with infinite and pure desire above thee, As I yearn over thee. Yet he can do so much, and I can do so little. The combat is not fair: the rivalry Shuts out the human heart, for human swords are brittle:— God's sword must flash for thee! God's sword must flash, and hover like a bright flame o'er thee: God's fiery steel must sweep the pathway free. But I will be God's sword, till, broken, I fall before thee,— Dead in the path for thee! LOVED BEYOND WORDS II. LOVE'S PORTRAIT Truly it is a deed presumptuous, very daring, Thus to devise in song a golden frame, preparing To set therein thy face: It is as if God gave the rough stern wind the power To sing for evermore the soul of some white flower And this flower's soul before the world to place. The task is very large.—Love, give thy singer passion Pure as the sea and sun, that pure strong words may fashion A frame wherein to place, So that the world may see (and never, having met it Once eye to eye, could heart of mortal man forget it!) Love's portrait of the loveliest living face. I. ETERNAL JUNES Guard her for ever for my great love's sake, Lord God.—Be as a light about her head: Shield her through solemn hours of darkness dread, And when the golden summer mornings break. If one must suffer, let not her heart ache, But pierce my own strong suffering heart instead! If sacrificial blood-drops must be shed Wilt thou not honour me, and my blood take?— Thou couldst not give us that one sweet June-day! Most hard it seems, and ever will seem hard. But give to her eternal Junes, I pray, Full of flower-happiness, divine, unmarred E'en by one petal falling from one spray: And let me share with thee the right to guard. June 30, 1883. II. LOVE AND LOVE I I raised my arms to heaven in agony And cried out wildly, “Frail are women fair! Their love is as a breath of sunlit air Or white cloud floating o'er a summer sea. What is her passion of soul compared to me, Me—for the storm-wreaths nestle in my hair And I the inexorable anguish bear Of one whose love outstrips eternity. “Her love is measured by the sands of time,— But mine is as the mountains or the stars: It snaps all manacles, it laughs at bars, Nor findeth the high blue airs too sublime. Her love is dainty as a rose's wings,— But through the plumes of mine the thunder sings.” II. I weeping said, “What is her love to this?” But, smiling, God said, “What is yours to mine? I am the sun that lightens the sea-line, And my lips meet the fragrant morning's kiss. I die with love for all. Yet all that is United my one pale thorn-wreath to twine. Because my love is perfect and divine It never knows fruition's final bliss. “What is her love to yours? Small, it may be. But yours to mine is as the rippling lake To the shore-margin where the vast waves break Full of song-echoes from the open sea. Your song is as the singing of a day:— My song laughs golden-haired when Time turns grey.” III. THE SEA'S BLESSING I would give the sea's blessing unto thee, O London blossom; as the salt sea-flowers Send up their blessing to our inland bowers And all the tameless freshness of the sea. The greeting of the sea-shore thyme and bee And of the wild spray's laughter-riven showers I bring thee,—and the gladness of long hours When inland thoughts recede eternally. Thou art not quite a daughter of the sea! Thou art so beautiful that he must claim Surely in the end thy beauty and thy name And in his strong divine arms gather thee, And add one inland sweet flower to his store Where fair-stemmed buds rejoice for evermore. IV. “I THINK OF THEE” If thou forgettest, love, I think of thee.— What if the white light-hearted wandering foam That hath the whole waste for its passionate home Of blue broad strong interminable sea Thinks little more of this than thou of me? What if the ferns, wherethrough the sun's rays roam Fostering, are heedless as smooth fronds they comb Of their sun's warm and genial potency? It matters little. Back into the breast Of the deep sea the foam-bell falls at last, And, when the hot sun's chariot seeks the West, The sweet ferns' sweetest tenderest hours are past.— So wouldst thou through the world have walked in shade Had not song's sunlight round about thee played. V. “IF I HAD NEVER SEEN THEE!” If I had never seen thee, what had then My life been! Just as much the lesser thing As the whole sea without one sea-bird's wing, Or the Scotch rocky deep grouse-haunted glen Without one blade of heather,—or, again, The fervent merry boyish-hearted Spring Without its festive choir of birds that sing, Or the dull world without the sun's gold ken. So much the lesser had my life been, love, Hadst thou not stepped therein its worth to seal.— God, when he made me a poet, knew that I, Born just to feel and sing, and sing and feel, Thee seeing, should leap my song's old heights above And in Love's name forbid thy name to die. VI. “WHAT CAN I DO FOR THEE?” This much at least, O love, for thee I do.— I give thee songlight round about thine head: Song's starlight and song's moonlight round thy bed And song's strong sunlight when the skies are blue. I hold thy beauty up to the world's view:— Death thou hast feared: I give thee life instead; Yea, life that shall not pause though we be dead And o'er our graves falls the soft tearless dew. Beautiful eyes and blue-black lovely hair! Sweet is it just to think that but for me Few might have known how passing sweet ye were. Even as no eyes might deem, far out at sea, The white sea-bird so nobly fair a thing Save for yon cloud that outlines breast and wing. VII. “I WANDERED ALL THROUGH HEAVEN” I wandered all through heaven, and saw its leafy arches, And breathed its scent of pines and fragrance of its larches, And watched its white seas break; I saw the clover wave upon its hill-sides spacious, And saw the gold corn bend in undulations gracious, And marked green islands float on many a lake: I wandered through new towns in heaven, and marked fair faces Full of the wondrous light that gleams through heavenly places,— Eyes brown and all divine: But, all through heaven, I saw, though far and wide I wandered, And where I wandered, searched, and sought and dreamed and pondered, No eyes so clear, so beautiful, as thine. VIII. FROM THE THEATRE TO THE COUNTRY My whole heart longs to see thee, sweetheart mine, No longer where the gaslights flame and flare, But where the pure sweet-scented country air Plays with green tender boughs of larch and pine. Had ever forest Dryad eyes like thine I wonder, or wood-nymph with leafy hair So sweet a smile?—For thee the ferns prepare Their soft fresh scent, and the beech-leaves their shine. I long to see thee where the sunlight falls Upon some grassy bank which bees pervade Or where some giant oak-tree casts deep shade, Or where the circling sea-mew curves and calls. Thine are not only the theatric boards, But also dew-kissed leaves and velvet swards. Aug. 8, 1883. IX. CENTRALISATION It is so strange to think that of ten thousand faces Thine have I loved and sung.—The summer wind embraces The flowers of all the hills, And yet it tarries, perhaps, with special love and yearning Beside some hare-bell,—back, and ever backward turning, While with deep love the wild wind's dark glance fills. And God turns back at times from all the tropic blossoms That with their warm white deep sweet-scented tropic bosoms Lure down from heaven the sun And concentrates his love on English fern, or daisy Whose gold heart heavenward gleams through English grasses mazy, Turns from all other flower-loves,—loves that one. For ages through the stars' wild endless complication God steered his course,—and through the struggles of each nation And history's streams of gore, His eyes on you and me:—just as to-day's azalea Or purple-petalled deep strong sun-confronting dahlia Was planned in Eden, and designed of yore. Then through the crush and crowd of fierce star-systems meeting And tides of human strife advancing and retreating And all the clash of things God makes that we should meet: and foldeth round about me, That I may quite forget the rattle of arms without me, Thy white eternal soft angelic wings. X. “THE SUNSETS CAME TO ME” The sunsets came to me, with red cheeks flushed and burning: “Not one of us survives, for all our love and yearning And beauty,” so they said. The honeysuckle came; and violets from the meadows; And king-cups; and their eyes were full of soft sad shadows: “Lo!” said they, “soon we too shall join the dead.” And many blue waves came, and green waves, and grey waters, And dark-eyed woodland nymphs the dark-leaved forests' daughters, And mermaids from the sea, And river-maids with blue long dripping watery tresses: And each one said, “How sweet are Love's warm soft caresses; Why should Love's lustrous white wings ever flee?” And then I thought: “If these survive not, what, I wonder, Of thee, fair lady mine? Will death's malign black thunder, Across thy pathway roll Never? If all the world thus groans in ceaseless bondage,— Wave, sunset, river, lake, mermaiden, golden frondage— Nymphs of the woodland, daisies of the knoll— “If this be so with each,—if each be born to suffer, Do death and pain on these lay hands less courteous, rougher, Than they will lay on thee? Canst thou escape thy fate more than the dark-eyed maiden Whose leafy hair with scent of dim pine-woods is laden, Or than the blue-haired goddess of the sea?” XI. CONTRASTS After the tossed white sea a pool of green still water Wherein some white-limbed nymph the great green oaktree's daughter Bathes with blue laughing eyes: After the fierce wild storm the blue sky pure and tender: After bronzed brows of men a woman's untanned splendour: After the night the royal red sunrise: After the weary day the night-time cool and gracious: After the city-walls a golden cornfield spacious Wherein red poppies gleam: Upon the Atlantic surge a lonely wave-tossed vessel Whose masts in the mad wind bend, shriek, and toil, and wrestle,— Yet in the cabin eyes where love-thoughts dream; These contrasts all are sweet:—Yet sweeter than the sweetest It was when thou didst come, of all loves far the fleetest, The swiftest tenderest thing,— Contrasting with my past thine own ethereal brightness And with the black pain-cloud thy more than sea-bird's whiteness, As through yon rain-cloud flashes one white wing. XII. ENGLISH ART I long for the great day when English Art Shall be the outcome of the English race. When every woman shall have Venus' face And the Madonna's beauty, and her heart. When we shall seek no longer strength to impart And beauty, and a far-off foreign grace, To our own Art from any alien place, In English field and street and house and mart Seeking our models:—for the day I long When beauty, love, like thine shall fill the land Inspiring some great English Titian's hand And some great English Dante's sea-winged song. I wait the day when English Art shall be Commensurate with sunlight, and with thee. XIII. THEE, THE CROWN OF HISTORY Time through the patient centuries struggled hard And moulded many an English face divine And set song's sunlight round each for a sign And brought to Beauty's feet full many a bard. Time moulded the supreme charm evil-starred Of Mary, and Time wove the golden shine Of countless tresses, and prolonged the line Of English beauty, keeping patient guard Over the English type through year on year:— But now Time's work is over and complete For, sweetheart, thou, the crown of all, art here. Now the whole past of history giveth ear: The English ages bend before thy feet: The English white-browed chainless waves revere. XIV. “WHEN BEAUTY LIKE THINE” When beauty like thine is a common thing (If ever such surpassing grace may be!)— When English womanhood doth copy thee As the white sea-foam copies the white wing That hovers o'er it: when the far years bring Grace in their train: when senseless fashions flee: When future artists' happier eyes may see A nobler English architecture spring Upward around them: when the clothes we wear, The homes we build, are no more deadliest foes To Art: when England wins a great repose And for the first time sees how very fair Her towns and people might be—she will bear Art that will blossom like her heavenliest rose. XV. THE REVOLT OF NATURE If thou dost go, Summer will follow thee With eager lips and eager hair back-blown, Leaving one hasty sandal by his throne; And moon and sun and stars and white-waved sea And flowers and leaves will cry, “Let not this be!” And Spring will start and stay her girlish laughter And, seeing thee go, will straightway follow after; And in thy wake the fall's red leaves will flee. Summer will dally with the expectant rose, Waiting for thee to flush its cheek to red: Lorn he will stand beside the garden bed: The sun's brush by the sunset will repose Ungrasped; and not one love-word will be said To any flower by any wind that blows. XVI. A SUNSET I watched a sunset,—and I noted down The cosmic river of colours as they came. First golden splendour: then clear crimson flame: Then one pale-blue pure sky-spot like a crown. But the wind saw me writing with a frown And drove new clouds across the heavens so fast That new tints shone before I seized the last,— Green, lemon-colour, lilac, purple-brown. Half in despair I flung my “notes” aside, And owned the cosmic spirit's superb excess.— So, lady, having for a long year tried Thee to describe, I feel defeat no less. The cosmic spirit has set more beauty in thee Even than in sunsets over windy sea. XVII. THE MARVELLOUS NIGHT This was the glory of thee,—that all the sweet night found me Because of thee, and wound its starlit wings around me And kissed me into sleep. Yea, every star stepped forth, between me and the sorrow Of pale accustomed life that waited on the morrow: Thine was the army of night's purple deep. Between me and my past the whole star-army waited.— Therefore it was that all my soul, set loose, elated, Sprang forth with chainless glee. The innumerable stars were as a hedge behind me That never one fell throb of old-world pain might find me; And all this vast star-army followed thee. Thou wast the chieftainess of all the gathered legions Whose golden serried spears filled the blue heavenly regions, Each spear a valiant friend: Yea, onward through the night the star-hosts marched together, A night so still that one might hear a falling feather; Onward they came, an army without end. And then I heard strange voices;—voices of the flowers And voices of my past; the voices of old hours Of summers long since dead; Voices of streams and hills, and voices of the mountains, And voices of far-off white-footed laughing fountains; Whispers of autumn sunsets golden-red; Voices of leaves of trees, and voices of green meadows, And voices of the limes tender with summer shadows; And last of all to me Came thrilling through the dark, sudden, without a presage, The deep-voiced stern immense inevitable message, Winged with large storm-winds, of the awful sea. And this was what they said: “Deep in thy spirit know it; Grasp this with grasp intense; cling to the knowledge, poet! Through all thy days be sure That never again the night will open thus her bosom Nor ever again the leagues of golden star-flowers blossom Enfolding thee in vast embrace and pure. “This night thou hast the deep of heaven spread out before thee And all the golden stars shake out their banners o'er thee And rapture like a sea Surges. But not again shall the deep heaven be tender.”— Yet, love, that sacred night's unfathomable splendour Took all its deathless boundless light from thee. Sept. 17, 1883. XVIII. FOR ONE HOUR I heard a voice that said: “Take up thy pen And write. Tell all the world how vast a deed The star-winged God of starry love decreed Once, that can come to pass now never again. Tell the world how the whole night's endless fane Opened, and all the armies of the night Filled the black vistas with gold flow and flight And all dark things and doubtful were made plain. “Tell all the world how strange and great a thing Then came to pass, that for one silent hour The hosts who the deep walls of heaven embower Halted, and peered from heaven's heights wondering: Gazing with all the eyes of all their throng Upon one form,—the lady of thy song.” XIX. A YEAR AGO A year ago to-day we met: and yet it seemeth That in thine eyes, as then, to-day my whole soul dreameth— And ever, evermore, I shall dream in thine eyes, and call to mind our meeting; Not only through the years of earth-life pale and fleeting, But where blue heaven's waves strike a golden shore. Thy beauty never fades: thine eyes will never darken: Still to thy silvery laugh with my whole soul I hearken: Yes, in a thousand years, If I could be alive, the mere thought of our meeting Would set my ancient heart's each giant pulse a-beating And fill my eyes with the forgotten tears. XX. GOD'S GOSPEL This day, one year ago, God preached his Gospel to me And sent his spirit of flame with fiery shaft that through me All on a sudden sped: This day, one year ago, God woke old dreams of wonder And brake long ages' chains with sudden stroke asunder And raised Love's Christlike pale form from the dead. This day, one year ago, God sent his servant passion To recreate the world in golden gracious fashion And renovate the skies. This day, one year ago, not needing marble “table” Nor priest nor prophet grim, nor help of myth nor fable, God preached his Gospel through a woman's eyes. XXI. “THIS CHANGELESS GRACE” If thou must ever come, then pass away, Like the sad ending of a dream too sweet For treading therein with cold wakeful feet— A dream that vanishes when morning grey Peers in the chilly loveless face of day And summons him from his forlorn retreat Long hours of pain and labour to repeat— If thou must thus the laws of time obey, Yet is it not unalterably good That once at least in life I have seen thy face, Once touched thy hand, and once beside thee stood? Have I not won at least this changeless grace That in the heart of him who loved and sang Thou hast left love endless,—and an endless pang? XXII. LOVE'S FINAL SWEETNESS For this it is which is so sweet to me, To suffer for thee:—When the last days came And Byron with his eyes and heart aflame Looked round the earth to see what cause might be Worthy to die for, “Lui qui, rassasié de la grandeur humaine, Comme un cygne à son chant sentant sa mort prochaine, Sur terre autour de lui cherchait pour qui mourir.” —Alfred de Musset had he known but thee His grim forlorn heart had not tarried long Seeking an altar meet for love and song And sacrifice heaven-sweet eternally. To die for Greece! Yes, sweet: but sweeter far To die for thee, if only so I might Prove that my love for thee is winged with light And passionately true, O one sweet star Brightening with glory of one golden bar My shield that else were sable as the night. XXIII. “REMEMBER” If ever comes the day when thou dost fail My heart's deep inner truth to understand,— If sorrow invades us,—if this songful land Be ever darkened and love's skies turn pale While summer's bright leaves tremble at the gale,— Remember then—remember evermore— I loved thee, loved thee, loved thee; through the roar Of evil wintry winds, let that wild wail “I loved thee, loved thee, loved thee,” reach thine ear. By heaven, by God, if all else were untrue,— If all the stars in heaven's height quaked for fear And tremor shook the sea's eternal blue,— “I loved thee, loved thee, loved thee” yet would be Heard above death-throes of the stars and sea. XXIV. MY LIFE'S BEST DEED Think gently of me, if the day should come When thou (ah God, the sorrow!) hast to go. Think gently of me when the blossoms blow: Think gently of me when the lilac-bloom Covers Spring's brow with many a purple plume: Think gently of me when the wintry snow Whitens the streets, and when the red flames glow On the bright hearth at Christmas, in thine home. Think gently of me, if the day should dawn When thou must (God, the sorrow!) pass from sight: Think how thy passing makes the whole world night: I shall be very tired, when thou art gone. Think gently,—even tenderly,—of me: Far my life's best deed was my love of thee. XXV. STARLIGHT What I would ask thee is to let me give— Give love, give help, give perfect tenderness. I ask no flower: I ask no soft caress: But only just to worship while I live. Love's dreams alas! are often fugitive: Only the love whose chief joy is to bless Outlasts life's anguish and its stormy stress; Love that bestows, not hoping to receive. Let me love so. And let me sometimes see Thy face.—God sets ten million stars each night Upon the brow of heaven to give man light; Do thou my sweet eternal star-love be: Let me when starlight gleams upon my grave Feel—“I asked nothing. I but loved and gave.” XXVI. MY SONG I am so far, far, nearer death than thou That I can love thee with the next world's strong Sweet love, and hear its music in my song And set its sacred starlight on thy brow. Not for to-day do I allegiance vow, But for all time. Not for to-day I long To crown thee,—but to crown thee 'mid the throng Before whose feet even Time himself must bow. If thou must leave me, let my song be thine For ever; let it be a token of this That though God never let me win thy kiss Yet in some strange sweet sense he made thee mine. Mine,—for till God's hand smite the heaven and sea Man's heart will love not as my heart loves thee. XXVII. NEVER Never will any man be stricken deep By thy sweet arrow of beauty quite as I When after weary passionless long sleep I looked up suddenly,—and thou wast nigh! No man will ever love thy wondrous face Quite as I love it. Though a thousand may Admire thy beauty and thy girlish grace, Still true it is that I am not as they. They gaze and they pass on. But I adore. They think they love. I love till time doth grow Weary of rose-hung hill and wave-white shore: Yea, till the Alps wax weary of their snow. I stand alone in this—that no man brings His heart, and counts its blood-drops while he sings. XXVIII. THE PATH OF DEATH At last the sacred path is opening out before me: Its mists and dews of night and scents of flowers fold o'er me Ceaseless and sudden wings. The path that Byron trod, and Keats,—are we to tread it? So many have passed along the road, and shall we dread it? Lo! the whole road with weird soft whispers rings. Whispers there are of men, and whispers soft of lovers Among the groves that line the path and fill the covers With soft luxuriant bloom. Ah! this is not the path of death. Nay surely, surely Death's path is darker far, and tenanted obscurely By grey-winged ghost-shapes shuddering from their tomb. This path is very fair. We mark old well-known faces: Full are the banks of ferns, and full are the wild places Of flowers whose scent is meet:— We deemed the path of death was terrible. We tread it, And lo! that moment cease, for ever cease, to dread it; And even its terrors wax exceeding sweet. What terror can be left when, rocky, grassy, gravelled, Flowerless or full of flowers, not one yard is untravelled Of the once lonely way? Thousands have gone before, and made the pathway brighter: Yea, women's souls have left the roadside blossoms whiter And men's strong souls have left its ghosts less grey. We soon shall have the right to tread the lonely valley. The buglers of the ghosts will sound their wrathful rally; But we reck not of these: We think of poets great who trod the valley-border And entered heaven beyond in spite of watch and warder And drank the fragrance of the heavenly breeze. And I,—I think of thee. No road that thou wilt travel, Though o'er it mists and fogs their wild wet locks unravel, Can deadly or dangerous be. If thou must one day pass along the road, it follows That Love dreads not the path's dim darkest deepest hollows More than sea-birds the green gulfs of the sea. XXIX. “YET THIS I ASK” Yet this I ask, this simple thing, of thee. Be always good and noble for my sake.— Because thou hast the very power to break The heart of man, and move it utterly, Use thy divine sweet gift unselfishly:— While I the cloud-swept lonely sea-path take Let me look back to the furze-golden brake Of morning, bright with butterfly and bee, Remembering one, bright as the morning, there, Who powerless yet with the sea-wind to cope Still gathered from her singer heart of hope Ever towards heights of nobleness to dare, And, queen of all the flowers, was queen besides Of her own spirit, and sovereign of its tides. XXX. “FATHER AND LOVER” Father and lover am I all in one.— Father; since half my life was lived before I met thy glance,—and loved thee evermore: Father; since more than half my work was done Before I knew thee, daughter of the sun And child of morning:—Lover, since I found Heaven in thy presence, heeding nought around So only one sweet answering look was won. Father; since ever greedily I sought To shield thee from the world and all its woes: Lover; since songful flower on flower I brought,— Violet and jonquil and great trembling rose: And madman too; since all I gave had nought Of power my true deep yearning to disclose. XXXI. MY ANCHOR Thou art my anchor in a stormy sea, My one sweet anchor,—holding fast my life In the dim mist of trouble and wild strife To the pure vision of the love of thee.— Without thine help where would my harbourage be? Life's billows fierce and iron-tongued and strong Would slay my spirit, and engulf my song, And the fair golden hope of heaven would flee. This thou hast taught me,—that a weary man, Weary with life and tired-out past all speech, May suddenly a new road-corner gain Whence, fair beyond all hope of words to reach, New lovely flowerful meads may stretch away, While golden sunset gilds the death of day. XXXII. “THIS THOU HAST TAUGHT ME” This thou hast taught me,—that it may be grand Beyond all words to feel oneself grow old: To watch the mists from brightening summits rolled And pass from sweet youth's to strong manhood's land. Thou hast turned my life's page with thy dear white hand; Lo! with glad gaze my wondering eyes behold Undreamed-of mountains touched by morning's gold, And at the borders of new realms I stand. This thou hast taught me,—that the land of death To which, long ere thou tread'st it, I shall go May be a sweet and gracious land to know If only till his last long mortal breath A man shall strive to love unselfishly, As God's sure stars love the tumultuous sea. XXXIII. GOD'S LAURELS Not fame; not high repute; not praise of men; Not to be worshipped loudly when he died As king or poet,—honoured far and wide; No pedestal of large renown to gain; Only the pangs of immemorial pain:— For his chief honour? To be crucified.— For his companions? Thieves on either side.— For his bright cordon? The slow red blood-stain.— This was his crown. To die 'mid shouts of scorn; Lonely, forsaken, yes of God it seemed, Pain-stricken, cursed, unutterably forlorn,— While even yet with love the deep eyes gleamed. To be the man of all men most downtrod— These were the laurels of the Son of God. XXXIV. ANOTHER YEAR Another year has passed,—and still my soul may love thee, And still my wings of song may hover, sweet, above thee: God still lets this thing be. Then shall I not be glad, yea past all strong words grateful, That still I have the right in this world wild and hateful To love, to love,—to break my heart for thee. That still I have the right, supreme and past denial, To pray to God to lift thy soul through every trial; That still God looks to me By prayer and anguish strong to be thy guardian lover And with stern wings, blood-splashed but outspread yet, to cover And shield thine head; that still I fight for thee. Another whole long year,—and still I stand before thee, And still song's sword is drawn and flames and flashes for thee Like lights far out at sea Seen through the sombre mirk and rain-splashed deadly weather When the great ships shriek out and wail and plunge together Towards the wild whiteness thundering on their lee. Another whole long year,—and still I am thy lover; And still my song may seek, and still my shield may cover, Protect and safeguard thee. This is most good and great,—that all the flowers of summer Have passed and died, yet thou most sweet autumnal comer With the wild autumn comest back to me. This is most sweet to think,—that flowers beyond all number Have sought the Western slopes and sunk in pallid slumber, Soft bloom of shrub and tree, But still thou art mine own. Not all the stormiest weather Can move my soul when thou and I stand close together, For then the fierce winds seem to shout for glee. It is so sweet to know that though the summer passes, And all its scented flowers and all its feathery grasses Tremble and weep and flee, Yet thou art still the same. Thank God, thou hast not vanished! Oh, God, when, weary at last, the summer's face he banished Dreaded to banish thee. Yes, though the year has passed, the same glad love-chains bind me. So sweet thou art to me I dare not look behind me Or round, lest thou shouldst flee: When thou art with me, love, I only watch thy glances Lest thou shouldst pass away, and all the world's romances Vanish along with thee. XXXV. MY REWARD This reward have I for my love and pain: To feel through pain the sweet love deeper grow; The more I sacrifice, the more to know Of the pure secrets of love's inner fane. Yes, this is great and worth sharp pangs,—to gain Exquisite tender priceless knowledge so Of how the passionate heart of Love can glow Immortally, while mortal we remain. To feel my love wax deeper day by day: This is love's tender and divine reward; To find that perfect love no boundary keeps, But ever with inevitable sword That hurls all base and evil things away Through heights and depths of light and darkness sweeps. XXXVI. “HAUNTED FOR EVER” Not once in many days,—once in a generation, Doth beauty such as thine dawn forth upon a nation:— As, ever, Romney's art Struggled, in vain, to paint the beauty that he cherished Which but for him had past from the eyes of men and perished, So would I picture thee ere I depart. Yes: I was born for this. Wherever now I wander, Whatever dreams of life or dreams of Art I ponder, Most surely I still shall see, Down to my day of death, and far beyond (if over The mystic stream may pass the soul of man or lover), Through all far future time, the eyes of thee. For this end was I born, and sense of form and metre God gave me,—that thy laugh, than all fair music sweeter, Might in my song abide: For this God let us meet,—that I might ever after Be haunted by a dream—the dream of thy soft laughter, And by one yearning—to be at thy side. God trained my soul for this, and gave me power of singing, That when the moment came and thy soft laugh went ringing Down valley and sunlit dell My ear and soul might catch the deathless music in it And through all time be thine, to death-land from that minute, Haunted for ever by its mystic spell. XXXVII. THE CROWNING GRACE No wonder I was dazed: no wonder I was gladdened. Thy beauty is of the type that now and then hath maddened A whole great nation's heart: Priceless to all who meet the sacred God-sent jewel; Priceless if it be kind, death's dart if it be cruel, But ever deathless in the land of Art. This hath been given to thee. The beauty that can harm us,— Redeem or sink to hell,—lift us, delight us, charm us Into a worship wild. But oh be more than this! Add to thy beauty's splendour The grace that crowneth all, when through a woman's tender Deep eyes shine forth the pure eyes of a child. XXXVIII. PERFECT REST This gives me perfect rest,—this is my exceeding rapture. Quite to forget myself, and my own thoughts, and capture Some new sweet sense of thee. To lose myself in thee. To watch, soul-pale and breathless, The beauty that gleams forth, inevitably deathless: To see nought else but this,—yet this to see. I never knew the rest that God could give a poet Till thee I saw, and now I never more can know it Save when thou art with me. It rests my whole deep soul past words and past all measure And gives my weary heart unfathomable pleasure To wonder and gaze, and gaze and wonder at thee. XXXIX. “IF CHRIST BE ‘RISEN INDEED’” If Christ be “risen indeed,” is this not then the presage Of a strange deathless sweet immeasurable message,— A token of what shall be Not only for the hills and limitless blue mountains And silver-laughing hearts of fern-embroidered fountains And for all flowers, but also, love, for thee? Not only will all lands hear somewhat of the token: Not only will death's deep dark evil spell be broken For the immemorial past: Not only will the stars rejoice and sing together And newly risen birds spread forth bright deathless feather As on the laughing winds their wings they cast: Not only will the heaven to Cleopatra's splendour Sweeter and nobler now, great peerless homage render: All past fair queens shall rise With the eternal light of heaven within their glances And all the fire of old beloved and high romances, Flaming, shall be rekindled at their eyes. The message is for all: for all the world of roses And for the violet blue whose humbler head reposes Beside the roses' feet. The message is for each: for every generation; For the deep heart of each vast struggling heaving nation:— Lo! “Christ is risen.” Is not the news most sweet? The news that Love and Life are after all the stronger: That if pale hate holds out, sweet rose-flushed Love lasts longer: The news that death is dead, And that triumphant Love, though weary with long labour And fiercer strife, may sheathe at last his bloodied sabre And raise towards stainless airs his golden head. The beauty that struck deep,—the wondrous look that maddened,— The summer sunful eyes that, as they glistened, gladdened The whole world like the morn,— These shall not pass away. Nay, with a glance supremer Thine eyes shall seek in heaven for me thy poet-dreamer, Demanding that new nobler song be born. XL. MY POST Oh, have I not this post—to sing for ever for thee? To shed the glory of song and love's vast sunshine o'er thee, Watchful lest harm befall. Oh, have I not this right, supremely grand and fateful, For which of all God's gifts I am to God most grateful,— The right to suffer for thee more than all? This is my part, my post. No man can take it from me. No strength can now disarm, no sword-edge can displume me: In front of thee I stand. To die for thee were sweet. To live for thee is harder. Yet, patient, this I do,—an ever watchful warder At the sweet golden gates of fairy-land. XLI. STARS AND THE SUN All other faces fade before thy face imperial. As the dark night fades out when once the blue ethereal Bright daylight fills the air: As all the flowers draw back behind their leafy curtain Instinctively afraid when regnant, red-lipped, certain Of amplest homage, the grand rose draws near. The man who has seen thee may well draw back in wonder.— O man, the years may pass, the purple skies may thunder, The clear spring freshets run, New crimson dawns may break, new golden mist-wreaths brighten, Yet till thy head at last with weary hair doth whiten What stars are left thee, having seen the sun? XLII. FAIRY-LAND Pure must the warder be whose anxious footstep waits, Watchful for evermore, beside the fairy-gates: But who would enter there Must even purer be, and stronger, and his hand Spotless,—if he would tread the sacred fairy-land And breathe its mystic air. If I would worship thee, and tread, with thee beside, The grass of fairy-land, how pure and strong and wide And deep my soul must be! “God! purify my heart,—that it may have the power To enter fairy-land with this sweet fairy flower.’ “Fairy: I follow thee!’ XLIII. OLD DREAMS Old dreams of fairy-land, pure boyish dreams delightful, Returned along with thee. My soul once more with rightful Strong energy took flame. Old dancing glancing thoughts the long sad years had hidden Sprang forth to life renewed, at thy sweet mandate bidden: Along thy path the dead romances came. These all leapt up alive, and sang in chorus round thee. The boyish woods took leaf, and bloom of old flowers found thee And pure old dreams once more Filled all my heart. Again I longed with knightly daring To carry thee away, through some green forest faring, Captive and hostage of some border war. Ah! those old days are dead. We cannot reillume them, Nor wake their worn-out hearts; we cannot disentomb them; We cannot bring them back, Nor mark once more, divine, and bright with laughter airy, Titania, loveliest queen and most delicious fairy, Weaving red heather-bloom beside the track. But thou hast brought them back. Thou in triumphant measure Hast quite renewed for me the lost days' boyish pleasure And given me heart to hear Slow, sweet, throughout the woods the fairy voices calling, And thine own laugh is like Titania's laughter, falling With lovelier cadence on my ravished ear. XLIV. A MESSAGE I want thee, dear, to know—if my life's work is over Nearly,—how proud I am that as thy songful lover I entered these last lists. Of all strong final work this I would choose the sureliest: A true man sings the best, as ever too the pureliest, With love's gold fetters round about his wrists. There is not any work,—if this indeed be nearly The end of all,—that I with vision keen, and clearly Discerning all, would take Sooner than this. To sing thy girlish beauty peerless And then to pass,—content and satisfied and fearless,— While all hearts love thee for the sweet song's sake. XLV. MADAME Madame!—no English word gives quite the shade of meaning,— What will you do when I on heaven's white sills am leaning Or singing high songs there? Will you bestow a thought on the old vanished lover As through the green-blue grass where lurks the scented clover You wander, breathing the June evening air? Madame! will you think much,—when at the play your laughter Rings out,—of one who heard and marvelled ever after With tenderest sweet surprise? As your soft blue-black hair falls round your shapely shoulder Will you remember one to whom all life grew colder When that dark hair-knot vanished from his eyes? XLVI. “THEE I CANNOT ESCAPE” Thee I cannot escape.—The whole great world remindeth My soul of thee. Whate'er of joy my spirit findeth It longs with thee to share: The glory of the moors alight with purple heather; The splendour of the calm untroubled summer weather; The low soft laughter of the moonlit air. When I behold the tides for ever surging, breaking, Against the granite walls that guard with base unshaking The wind-swept Cornish shore, I long for thee to see with me the vast Atlantic As the great waves with leap delirious and gigantic Charge upward,—and foam backward evermore. When I see white clear walls, and Southern hills and towers, I long for thee to thread the Southern vine-tressed bowers, Sweetheart, along with me: And so it comes to pass that I escape thee never; That every star of night bids me love on for ever, And every fern and flower suggest but thee. XLVII. LATE IN LIFE God! thou hast late in life bestowed upon me a treasure And given me one late sweet illimitable pleasure,— This maiden's eyes to see. God, turn them not away,—or how can I behold thee? God, take her not away. For mists will then enfold thee, And faith and hope will perish out of me. This treasure cometh late,—and after years of sorrow. O God of life and love, ward off the awful morrow When I shall wake and find Her hand removed from mine, and death's cold fingers grasping The poet's hand that laughed for tenderest pleasure clasping The slender fingers now by force untwined. XLVIII. ONLY AT TIMES 'Tis only at times I know how much my spirit loves thee.— When a brief sudden strain of heavenliest music moves me And thrills my soul to tears, I see my love designed and shadowed out before me And see its power and force still fierce and urgent o'er me Beyond the furthest years. It is as if God knew by briefest glimpses only The wonders of his worlds—the measureless weird lonely Star-space,—as if the dim Vast legions of his flowers defiled in ranks amazing Once in a thousand years, with spears and petals blazing Sunlike in front of him. It is as if the sea spake once in voice of thunder To God its Maker and Lord, and God was wrapt in wonder Even at the sea his child: Then spake not thus again for centuries long and weary, Lapping along time's shores with whisper grey and dreary, No more stern-voiced and wild. Even so I see my love spread out at times before me And awe and trembling dread and deep delight fall o'er me To think that time will cease And pain and death will end, and star on star grow tired, Ere thou shalt fail to be by my whole soul desired,— Ere love's strife end in peace. XLIX. WEARY Yes: I am weary indeed. But thou,—thou art not weary. What hath thy soul to do with grey thoughts dim and dreary? Thou art the morning's rose! Long after I am dead, the flowers will gather round thee: But still my glory is that mine the first hand crowned thee With love no heart else knows. This is my glory and gift; that I of all men brought thee The deepest truest love, and with sweet singing sought thee And gifts through long pain won. This is my crown; to know that though love's sword was keener Than grief's, I met its point with heart and glance serener Than flowers that meet the sun. L. STRENGTH AND SWEETNESS True love is very strong; yet love is very tender.— Just as the breeze to which the sea-waves' crests surrender First o'er the sea-waste goes Exulting in its strength: then seeks the garden bowers And mixes with the dreams of even the softest flowers And adds new beauty to the red-cheeked rose. True love is very strong; yet is it full of sweetness. Strength gives it grace, and grace adds to its full completeness Of power and force of wing. Sweetness and strength are one,—divinely, purely blended In love; in love that through the golden stars descended With thee, and gave me strength of soul to sing. LI. “EVER UPON THY LIPS A GLEAM OF SADNESS LINGERS” Ever upon thy lips a gleam of sadness lingers.— As if the god of love when with caressing fingers He touched thy lips and cheek Had sad thoughts in his mind, and some of these had wandered To thee,—and thou hadst since, upon the sad thoughts pondered And ceased sweet dreams to seek. More beautiful thou art for this one touch of sadness. Not all God's blossoms speak of infinite heaven-gladness: Not all the rivers dream Of joy. The blue waves sing, and laughter rings above them: Yet though we smile as well, and in our souls' depths love them, Far-off faint foam-crests gleam. Not all the woods are bright. Deep forest-arches darken. Not to the songs of birds do all the dense leaves hearken: Nay, some are sombre green. Sweeter they are for this.—With tenderer fascination The forest-vistas lure our love and admiration For shadows through them seen. So thou art sweeter far for this strange touch of sadness Upon thy lips and cheek.—It is as if when gladness Flushed all the rose's bloom One petal still was left devoid of scent and colour, In that behind sweet thought lurks ever the cold duller Dark sad thought of the tomb. LII. LOVE'S TASK I think a task so sweet, and yet so strangely solemn, Was never given to man.—Not with bright shaft and column A temple high to raise: No sculptured stone to blend with dreams of love and passion: Not through sweet music-chords to wander in wild fashion: Not by large song to win the Epic bays. Only to sing thy face: this is the task Love giveth. To sing the soul as well that in the deep eyes liveth: To sing,—as best I can. The task seems simple at first; yet, as the work proceedeth It seems, the while the heart is pierced of love and bleedeth, The cruellest sweet task ever set to man. LIII. LOVE'S MESSAGE All Nature hath its voice.—The meadows have their message. The river leaping down the rocky narrow passage Hath its own voice and heart. Each star hath its own voice, each sun its speech excelling; The fountain its soft voice of mystery upward welling. Tongued is the lightning's dart. Each poet hath his word.—Some in triumphant measure Sing of the reign of sweet old-world Saturnian pleasure: Some thunder like the sea. I sing of Love, Love, Love. I give the world for token The message that strong Love with sweetness never broken Himself has given to me. LIV. “HOW LITTLE DOES IT MATTER!” So, after thee comes death? How little does it matter! When Summer's fragrant hand has no more flowers to scatter And Autumn's keen-edged breath Thrills all the saddened fields that once were full of laughter, It matters little then if swiftly following after The Autumn's foot, comes death. If one face is so fair that all the others darken: If one laugh is so sweet one cares not now to hearken To laughter less divine: What matters it if death, upon their passing, follow?— What help is it to one forlorn autumnal swallow To see three red leaves on the eglantine? LV. THE SUMMER AND LOVE The Summer fluttered south, and gathered all its flowers From English woods and hills, and English lanes and bowers; Soft leaves from every tree: All these it gathered up, bright fragrant laughing legions, And sought with footstep glad the southern stormless regions,— But on a sudden paused and looked for thee. Love saw sweet rest at last spread meadowlike before him And felt the robe of death fall soft and dewlike o'er him And knew what peace may be Within the arms of death; but, as he sighed for pleasure Supreme, he felt the loss, still, of one earthly treasure,— And with large eyes Love looked around for thee. LVI. THE DEATH OF ALL FLOWERS Now that I see thee, sweet, so very very little, It is as if the world lacked every blossom-petal. Bright golden stars abound And the fair silver moon is full of light, and tender, And all along the shore the white waves' olden splendour Breaks, with the same large sound: The world is full of grace: the summer dawns superber Even than of old: the wind finds still no hand to curb her As o'er the hills she flies:— But, when I see thee not, it is as if all flowers Lay dead.—All else is here, but bloomless are the bowers; Like me, they miss the sunlight of thine eyes. LVII. “MORE THAN THE FLOWERS FOR JUNE” More than the flowers for June,—more than the lonely surges Long for the sweet West wind that combs their crests and urges Their white steeds on the way:— More than the lonely stars when all the heaven is pallid Long for the countless hosts that round about them rallied Ere the first gleam of morning's banner grey: More than the river's heart that longs to hear the laughter Of the strong far-off sea, and yearneth wildly after The shadeless waves and sun: More than the dark-green woods, their bowers with leaves adorning, Long for the eager kiss of buoyant-hearted morning, I long for thee,—till love and pain grow one. LVIII. LIKENESS IN UNLIKENESS Because my soul is strong, but thine is as a flower; Because I am a cloud that stoops above thy bower With thunder in its song: Because thou art so sweet, and full of beauty gracious; Because my soul is large, and through its vistas spacious Roam dreams of pain all day and all night long: Because we are alike in nothing, and can never Be more like than the flower and cloud that shields for ever The simple flower and fair: Because the bitter god, the singing god Apollo, Is ever unto me the one god whom I follow, I love past loving thy black bayless hair. LIX. FAIRY-TALES Yes: “fairy-tales” you love.—But was there ever fairy So full of love and life, and laughter light and airy, And soft coquettish glee, As thou art? All the tales the thought of man has fashioned Held never yet a queen so graceful and impassioned: The sweetest fairy never equalled thee. Ah, dear old fairy-tales! I would that thou mightst love them For ever, and with eyes quite tearless bend above them For ever and evermore. Life is no fairy-tale. There comes an hour for waking. Yet when I gaze at thee, I see the soft waves breaking On sacred dreamland's ever-golden shore. LX. GIFTS And still I may bring gifts?—As, on a sudden waking, God hears the same soft waves upon the same shores breaking And knows that he may bring Gifts to the waves, and laughs for very joy and pleasure, I laugh for very joy in my small mortal measure, Glad that my heart may still bring gifts, and sing. The whole expanse of sea needs sea-birds, and the ocean Of blue tumultuous air in wild incessant motion Needs radiant plumes of stars: The fiery vast superb broad-meadowed sunset-region Needs flowers of crimson clouds and many a vaporous legion And fleecy coronets and golden bars. And ever God exults that day by day new-waking The right to pour out stars and flowers with hand unshaking Is his,—the right supreme. The power and right to deck the world his love eternal With infinite blue sky sun-lighted and diurnal And stars her hand caresses in a dream. The world is God's own love. He hastens to adorn her: Her robe is bright with stars; it gleams at every corner; And sunshine fires by day The splendour of the world's illimitable raiment:— God takes his own delight for amplest sweetest payment When laughter flashes from her eyes of grey. And, when thine eyes of brown flash tenderer sweeter pleasure, I am repaid, O love, in measureless sweet measure For any gifts I bring.— God gives the world each day gifts sacred and eternal: The glory of its noon; its moonlit peace nocturnal; Its jewelled flash of many a sea-bird's wing. And I,—I do rejoice to know that I may bring thee Just one small gift or two; that, living, I may sing thee With love's own tuneful breath: That, living, I may love,—and if I die to-morrow May love thee in the world that knows not change or sorrow With love that bridges the abysm of death. LXI. STARS, AND STARS I kept account of all the times we met, Just as a prisoner watching through his bars Might keep account of the few friendly stars On which each night his longing eyes were set. And each star-meeting was an endless debt To God and Fate for infinite delight:— Those sweet star-meetings! few and soft and bright Upon life's background carved in starless jet. But now it may be we may oftener meet.— The thought thrills through me just as if there went Along the prisoner's soul a large content And sudden sense of something strangely sweet When, free at last, outside his prison-door He saw his five stars lost in millions more. LXII. “SO GREAT A THING” If Life with all its songs and all its dreams— Its flowers and scents of June, its songs of May,— Its early dreams of love that pass away And float like red leaves down the autumn streams Of pale remembrance; Life with all its gleams Of moonlit storm-clouds seen through sheets of spray And sunny noons that merge themselves in grey Dim afternoons wherethrough no sunlight beams:— If all these things be but of little worth— If it be hardly worth while to be born Just to feel Fate's black-browed sinister scorn And watch all sunlight slowly fade from earth,— Yet to have seen thee is so great a thing That even Life was worth encountering. LXIII. SONG I The fleet-winged sea-bird stays not for the sea, Nor thou for me O love most fleet! The strongest prayer that passionate love can pray Holds not one day The rose's feet. II God weeps each night to see the flying beams And golden gleams Of stars that fail. Love's very soul would die to hold the flowers, But sweetest bowers Turn soonest pale. III One little moment, love, I hold thee fast; Then is it past? One fairy day! One little tender moment;—ah, how soon The woods of June Turn gaunt and grey! LXIV. “IF SO THINE EYES WOULD NOT FORSAKE THE DREAM!” I dreamed of thee last night.—All night thine eyes before me Shone strangely clear and sweet, and strange delight flowed o'er me In rippling wave on wave. All night I dreamed of thee: and dreamed in tenderest fashion Of the great boon of death that crowns a perfect passion And of large light that gleams beyond the grave. How gladly would I cease the feverish pain of living If only thy sweet eyes might ever be forthgiving The same soul-maddening gleam: How gladly would I let the one night's dream continue Into the dream of death, if therein I could win you,— If so thine eyes would not forsake the dream! LXV. A DREAM “Since thou hast loved with love so wild and sweet That life and time have faded quite away And thou hast learned to count the hours of day By love's heart's inner and triumphant beat At the dear coming of thy lady's feet; Since, when she is not with thee, dark and grey Is all the world—thy service to repay And thy soul's strong forlorn desire to meet, I send a dream:” even so the Love-god said. Then I was 'ware that round about my bed Crowded dim forms of angels and of men, And the next world shone clear as in a glass. They bowed before my might of love and pain, And Death, bare-headed, moved to let me pass. LXVI. MY LADY'S POST OF DANGER Oh have I not beyond all other men By love's sheer power eternal and supreme And by the absorbing might of passion's dream And by the solemn majesty of pain Earned the great right the foremost post to gain Where the white wild delirious sword-blades gleam? Have I not struggled, that love's light might beam Upon a knightly shield without a stain? O Lord of love, if recompence there be In the eternal universe of things For anguished love that surges like a sea Yet rides above the rolling waves, and sings, Grant me for recompence superbly fair Her foremost post of danger. Put me there. LXVII. PAIN'S AGONY PASSES INTO AN AGONY OF LOVE As through the winter's gates the joyous spring-tide passes, Her bright brow wreathed with flowers and buds and clinging grasses,— And then the summer shines, With songs of many birds and sound of many rivers And laughter of the leaves that rustles down and shivers Through the concordant leafage of the pines: As still there is a sense of agony just over That even pales the rose and troubles the sweet clover At times, and thrills the grove, So, in our human lives, an agony of weeping, Though summer's silent peace upon the hills be sleeping, Becomes, not joy, but agony of love. LXVIII. “IS THIS TOO MUCHO?” If my deep strong love yearns for sympathy,— Yearns that at least its solemn depth and height Should flash before thee like the sudden white Vision of cliff that overhangs the sea: If I would by the love that burns through me Win for my soul the unspeakable delight Of knowing that my own love's mastering might Is in a measure understood of thee, Is this too much? Did not the Lord Christ long With passionate heart whose yearning knew no bound That even on earth might some response be found To his own love most tender and most strong? Does God himself in heaven not yearn at whiles For answering tears of man, and answering smiles? LXIX. THY DESCENT Straight from the Roman women thou art sprung,— Though many generations intervene Since in thine home the Roman spears were seen And the strong steel-bound Roman harness rung. Thine ancient home is where the wind hath sung In Cornwall to the Atlantic's vast blue-green For ages, and Iseult herself hath been Upon thy cliffs, and heard the wild wind's tongue. But thou art Roman. Strange it is to think That through thy Roman (not Italian) eyes Shines the triumphant light of Latin skies: That, as new generations rise and sink, Still the old Roman blood at times appears:— Thy dark glance traverses a thousand years. LXX. A WINTER'S DREAM After this winter, sweet beyond a poet's power To tell, though every word were tender, each a flower, What shall the new year bring? If winter is so sweet, can summer days be sweeter? Can summer's voice sound forth in yet more passionate metre? Can fairer blossoms deck the brow of spring? Selfish were such a thought, else I would long to follow Sweet winter, and to pass from life before the swallow Returns to English skies. O love, if thou art gone, my soul will hate the flowers! I dread to think how dark will be the brightest hours If summer takes its light not from thine eyes. LXXI. THE DEATH OF SONG With his soul lost within the rose's scent, How can the poet or lover sing the rose, Or discompose Even for song's sake his passionate content? When thou art near me, and thine eyes I see, The very spirit of singing fades away,— For thou to-day Art song, and wilt be song eternally. What are our songs and verses of the deep When close beside its awful strength we stand And watch the land Against whose breast the sweet warm billows leap? What are all songs and loving words to-day Save only mere wild mockeries of thee,— Whom when I see Song into silent wonder dies away. LXXII. NOT IN VAIN If through strong strife of mine, my life may shine forth purer, So that these prayers may fly with steadier flight and surer Towards God's high throne for thee, Why then the strife is worth mine uttermost endurance,— If only so I gain some inward sweet assurance That thou hast grown in spirit, and grown through me. If only one strong prayer of mine has brought thee nearer To happiness and heaven, and made the blue sky clearer For thee, or lightened pain, Why then, though weary I am, and heavy at heart, full often, Gazing at life and death with eyes that seldom soften, I have not lived, and have not loved, in vain. LXXIII. MY SWEETEST BLOSSOM I know that day by day death's cypress-grove more clearly Shines, that the flowers of life for me have perished nearly, And that the sunrise glows Far-off, the sunset near.—I know that thou art tender And young and fair and sweet, like the white maiden splendour Ere the sun kissed it of the first white rose.— I know that I shall pass while yet for thee the rivers Are blue and full of light,—while yet the alder quivers With young leaves o'er the tide; That, long ere thou art old, I may feel slowly wreathing Around my head death's cold inevitable breathing And mark his shadowy gaunt form at my side. Remember me, if death should take me while thou tarriest Still with the flowers of earth and thy light laughter marriest Still to the bright birds' song: Remember,—like a dream,—the poet-heart which found thee And the true poet-hand which circled thee and crowned thee With praise most tender, and with love most strong. Remember me.—Of all the flowers that I have gathered On slopes made bright with gorse, or hill-sides purple-heathered, Or cliffs that front the sea, The sweetest flower by far, the brightest and the truest, Of lilies my most white, of fairy bells my bluest, Is the sweet blossom of my love for thee. LXXIV. UNTRAVERSED TIME “Le ciel ayant á peine assez d'éternité!” —Victor Hugo Not here on earth I find half flowers enough to bring thee, Nor half the might of voice with which I fain would sing thee: The heaven with all its stars Would not be wide enough to give my soul expression; Nay, even there my heart would feel a grim repression And love would chafe against its prison-bars. I want a whole vast deep eternity to love in: The endless boundless blue for my soul's wings to move in: A wingless shipless sea Whereover free and large my spirit of love may wander: Vast ages for my soul on love's sweet lore to ponder: Untraversed time wherein to worship thee. LXXV. “IF ANY STRENGTH BE MINE” Oh, thou wilt be so fair within the deathless region.— Yea, love shall send a vast and limitless flower-legion To guard and line thy way: Thou shalt have for thine own the souls of all the roses; Armies of risen flowers the darkness sweet discloses Shall follow thee, and thy white hand obey. The blossoms that have died in immemorial summers Shall throng around thy steps, bright fragrant joyous comers From all the ends of time. The birds that died and rose shall gather, sweet, around thee,— And Love who sought for years but never never found thee Shall bring thee his own wreath of deathless rhyme. Then on the earth thy name shall be beloved and famous; One with the sweet dead names whose bright lights lure and shame us And shame our singing skill:— If any power be mine of meadow or of mountain, The music of the voice of even the smallest fountain That laughs with love of the sun-lighted hill,— If any share be mine of music of the waters, Thou shalt be well-beloved of earth's white-handed daughters In other days than these: If any soul be mine, or magic in my measure, Or part, however small, in the wild stormy pleasure And kingly love-song of the singing seas,— If any strength be mine of love supreme and deathless, Love that arises grand from every battle breathless With sorrow and fate and time,— If any force be mine, I give it, give it over To thee; I put my strength as singer and as lover Completely forth in the attempt sublime. I put my whole strength out for thee,—this one time only,— And then pass back again to my old shore-side lonely And watch the grey-eyed waves, Content, if I have placed thy soul beyond death's power, To know that all things else time's gulfing seas imbower At last, and swallow in their hungry graves. LXXVI. LOVE'S RIGHT What right have I to thee! What claim in words to fashion! Merely the right and claim of fiery love and passion And tenderness outpoured: Merely the right of Love the large-eyed world-redeemer; Merely the desperate right of one wild-hearted dreamer, And, if man doubt it, my most wakeful sword. Merely the final right of love that knows no limit: That gazes in death's eyes, but finds no power to dim it Or dwarf it set therein: Merely the right supreme by which when all the bowers Besought the brow of God to wear their choicest flowers He chose a thorn-crown, the world's love to win. LXXVII. A MASTERING AWE A mastering awe at times pervades me and possesses, Remembering that my song of woman's face and tresses Will silent one day be: This song may be the last of love-songs I shall fashion Before I leave behind earth's loveliest sweetest passion And face the passionless dark storm-lit sea. The awe is very deep and terrible that holds me When thus I dream. Its spell with strengthening force enfolds me, The sense of coming rest, Not on the heart of love, not on the soul of woman, But on a larger love than highest and best of human— Supreme repose upon the darkness' breast. Then if all men forget, it matters little to me; So that I feel the love of the large night flow through me And meet the night's sweet breath: If only each morn and night, when men would gather flowers And watch new sunrise gild the dew-kissed green-clad bowers, They think of thee and love thee,—what is death? I am content to end my songs, if I may fashion This song with such a wealth within it of sweet passion And song of flower and tree That never through all time may man or woman gather Violet, or leaf of beech, or tenderest stem of heather, Or hare-bell blue, without remembering thee! LXXVIII. “A DIVINER FACE” How strange it is to think that of ten thousand faces, Each lovely for itself, and each with its own graces, One face stands out supreme: How strange it is to think my steps have followed after Face upon face, till love was changed to tears or laughter, And yet this face outstrips my wildest dream. It is as if a man might worship flower on flower God smiling all the while in some eternal bower, Some moonlit heavenly place: Then on a sudden God, the moment ripe for meeting, Puts beauty past aside, and to the deep soul beating Reveals for ever a diviner face. LXXIX. EACH NIGHT Each night I think: “To-day has brought me one day nearer To seeing thee again,”—and still the thought grows clearer The sadder that it grows. For if again in life mine eyes should find thee never, Each day brings nearer death; and, after death, for ever With happier waves the heart's deep love-song flows. Yes: after death strange stars that mocked us in our lifetime Sail within reach, and even the great sea's stormy strife-time Sinks to superb repose. And God whose hand can make the loveliest flower diviner, Artist unequalled yet, omnipotent designer, Creates for love an unattempted rose. LXXX. LOVE The sea is very strong.—What is the power exceeding In strength of deathless voice the storm-wind's passionate pleading And mightier than the waves As o'er the rocks they leap in thundering white-lipped millions Or surge far out at sea by trillions and quadrillions And chant death-choruses o'er countless graves? What is the power that o'er the measureless sea-laughter Triumphs, and scorns the scorn that shouts and follows after Its fair triumphal feet? Love: raising nigher to God the love-song of the willows Than all the angriest chant of the sinister billows, And nigher to God love's true heart's humblest beat. LXXXI. LOVE'S SORROW When fair love's fragrant world first opens out before us, When first its sweet winds sing and golden stars shine o'er us, Its flowers are so divine We never never think of what shall follow after: We only hear the wind's caressing lovely laughter; We see no white crests on the far sea-line. Then when the dark days come, and all the flowers are faded, And the green thickets, dense with leafage once, invaded By the bleak keen wind's breath, We have the golden thought of summer days to cling to, And love's old image deep within the heart to sing to, Hurling song's utterance in the teeth of death. Yes. Love brings endless pain,—an infinite sword-anguish. Yet better far to love than through dull life to languish Devoid of love and pain. So, sweet, though love for thee has brought me pain exceeding Yet from my heart's true depths, though love therein lies bleeding, I cry, “Love's sorrow is immortal gain.” LXXXII. “THOU ART ALIVE” Yes: thou art still alive. The summer forests hold thee: The sombre clouds of night and morning's mists enfold thee: Though thou art not with me The great world has thee safe. Its golden-smiling meadows Caress thee, and thy laugh sounds ringing through the shadows That fall at even over the dim sea. It is not much to know; yet something is it, even If one's own soul be far,—past language far,—from heaven, To know that it is there. Ah me! the sight that I, each starry night, would die for The stars and blossoms gain, though this they never sigh for, Content with visions of the eyeless air. LXXXIII. CONCENTRATION I concentrate on thee with passionate concentration An age of undivulged unspoken adoration Of all things sweet and fair.— Lo! when I am with thee, the light that fell with glory Unspoken in my youth o'er mountains grey and hoary Streams o'er life's hill-tops, and fills all the air. I seem like one whose heart through years of pain has battled, Heedless of whistling bolts whose red wings round him rattled, Heedless of awful grief,— Who now stands, dead at last and risen and conqueror pallid, Upon the very field where round about him rallied The last stern square, ere death brought large relief. Therefore I love thee so. Because thou bring'st the message Of rest beyond the strife, and art thyself the presage Of lordlier peace to be, I love thee as a man might, in the midst of fighting, Love some sweet sudden glimpse, his angry eye delighting, Of far-off smokeless blue calm bloodless sea. The messenger thou art to me of life immortal. Thou standest evermore by death's dark secret portal And all its secrets close Are as the secrets then, most priceless and most tender, That God's own great hands sealed within the bloom and splendour Of the august and ever-gracious rose. It will be very sweet for ever and for ever To know that through the world with worn-out foiled endeavour While all things mocked at me I wandered through my youth, then when my manhood darkened And when my heart was numb with deadliest long pain hearkened To Christ and hope,—and to the voice of thee. Yes,—very sweet to know that through my love and yearning There came a gleam of hope—pale stormy wild hope turning Towards God its anguished eyes— Hope that there may be yet for each heart a Redeemer And that the deep-eyed Christ was more than merely a dreamer; Hope that love's song may reach supremer skies: Just one wild gleam of hope that God was in our meeting, And that thou art mine own beyond the feverish fleeting Small laws of time and space: Thou, even thou, O love; thou and the soul that gleameth For ever through the eyes of which thy singer dreameth For ever, worshipping thy deathless face. LXXXIV. “YET WHEN I STRIVE TO CEASE” Yet when I strive to cease, yea when I think of ending, It is but as a man whose eyes stoop downward, bending Towards river-banks made sweet With peppermint and thyme and tall reeds bright and gracious; Who says, “I am content: I need no more the spacious High hills and mountains for my wandering feet”:— It is but as a man who merely loving rivers And willow green that waves and alder dark that quivers O'er blue tides tenderly, Thinking to sing of these in some fair inland prison, Lifts sudden eyes of awe when lo! before his vision God stands majestic, and pours out the sea. So, infinite thou art. Though I may cease to sing thee Yet never will my heart through all time cease to bring thee Love infinitely strong. Yes: all the seasons' wealth, and every summer's flowers, And music of my life's long heavy-hearted hours, And my heart's tender praise and changeless song. Yet can I cease to sing? Can sunrise fail us? Never! My very heart is song, my love is song for ever, My soul is song for thee: My heart began to sing when first thy beauty found me And the sweet love of thee encircled me and crowned me As thy sole singer through eternity. LOVED BEYOND WORDS III. LOVE'S PRAYER I, having loved thee as none other soul Can love thee, stand before thy face to-day And of thy womanhood this boon I pray; That, as to thee I give myself heart-whole, Committing self to Love's divine control, So wilt thou give me—(thought too sweet to say!)— Love that shall never change or pass away But deepen onward towards a deathless goal. Oh change not, if I change not! Let the springs Of new fair flower and leaf that are to be Find, ever, only strengthening love in me: Let nobler gold suffuse love's white first wings: Oh, love, if this be what my true heart brings Of love, love, ever love,—then what of thee? I. “LOVE ME WITH THINE EYES’ Yes: love me with thine eyes.—If thy soft lips are dreaming Far other dreams than ours, yet through thine eyes are gleaming The dreams my love-songs bring. If summer's lips are sweet, yet summer's eyes are sweeter. If summer's hands are swift, yet summer's eyes are fleeter. In spring's sweet eyes resides the charm of spring. If only in thine eyes I see thy sweet soul waking, I am content; content though all my heart be breaking For very love of thee. If only in thine eyes I see thy sweet soul glistening, I am content,—for then I know thy soul is listening. Let thine eyes love me through eternity. II. “FIGHT ON” Fight on,—until the noonday sun be dead. Fight on, until the sun of afternoon Fade slowly,—till the sun of evening swoon With blood-shot eyes and smoke-wreaths round his head. Fight on,—while rises the fierce wrathful red Disk of the powder-grimed and sword-scarred moon. Fight on: the army of the stars will soon Give light. Fight on, when every star has fled. Fight through the darkness then, with only light Of all the enemy's eyes to guide the way Straight to the enemy's heart.—While sword can smite And arm can still the mastering will obey, Fight on. And, falling, first with wild delight See the foe stagger, in the death-dawn grey. III. OUR VICTORY Wilt thou not trust me, love, and wait the day When listening hearts do homage to my song? Wilt thou not trust me though the toil be long And many nights and mornings flee away Ere Fame's hand touch to gold the lingering grey? Wilt thou be sweet and true, if I am strong? —Waiting the hour when Justice slays all wrong And when Fame's lips my conquering will obey. Wilt thou not trust me till I bring thee indeed A crown beyond the crown of highest kings? The laurel crown that crowns the soul that sings And soothes the forehead where the thorn-points bleed.— Wilt thou not trust me till the victory's thine? I at thy feet, love, and the world at mine. IV. “ONE AGAINST MANY” I saw as in a dream the stars arrayed Against me,—endless legions surging nigh From the blue depths of fathomless clear sky; I saw their eyes flash through the golden shade. I was afar from help and mortal aid; My arm was weary and my lips were dry; Through daylight I had fought, and seen them fly, My foes,—but now new hosts the old outweighed. And yet I stood and with most weary eyes And weary hand and sword confronted them. Then as I stood, defiant though alone, The trumpet of a sudden wind was blown And in a moment lo! the crowded skies Were empty as seas no ships' keels ever stem. V. SPRING MESSAGES I. AFTER LONG MONTHS Straight from the dark of months thy sweet eyes flashed, and sought me; The light of vanished suns and former stars they brought me, And light of their own flame:— And from them all the sense of Spring-tide crocus-hearted Along my weary soul, swift, on a sudden, darted; And with thy voice the lark's new love-song came. Thou wast the spirit of Spring.—The sense of grassy meadows And merry leaves that dance and balmier twilight shadows Was born along with thee. All blossoms are not dead,—for thou art living, lady! So once again the sun will through the foliage shady Strike his long arrows, lighting flower and tree. Thou art alive. By this I know that Spring will follow: Now hyacinths will bloom, and hill and copse and hollow Will gleam with fiery gold. The silent heart of Spring that for thy mandate waited Will break to flower at last—Spring tortured and belated, Hiding his ferns and flowers in fold on fold. Thou hast the spirit of Spring and Summer's heart within thee: And who would love and hold, and worship thee, and win thee, Must meet the Spring's own eyes Fearless, and Summer's eyes,—and laugh for very pleasure When the bright fields spread out their limitless gold treasure Beneath the cloudless smile of stormless skies. I know that Winter now has passed away before thee. The very heart of May will worship and adore thee And kiss thine hands ere long.— The heart of all the world will come with love and gladness, And silver streams will seek with silver-voiced sweet madness To catch the echo of thy pure heart's song. And once again I lift the lyre the cold had frozen, And laugh to think how soon of all flowers thou the chosen Wilt put the flowers to scorn. When thou dost call on Spring, he wakes and follows after: In thine I hear the ring of very June's own laughter: Thine eyes are lovelier than a summer morn. II. ‘THY FACE” Among the weary crowd of weary common faces I linger,—and I search through flowerless dreary places, Seeking amid the throng One vision worth a thought. Pale Death and Sorrow meet me: Death sues me for a wreath, and Sorrow doth entreat me To crown her wild-haired forehead with a song. Then I take up mine harp, and sing of Death and Sorrow,— Of how the sweetest things are saddest things to-morrow; How pain fills every place; How woe has set its hand upon our city's features; How agony is grooved on brows of human creatures;— Then on a sudden, lady, lo! thy face. Then Death and Sorrow fade, and Pain smooths out before thee Its wrinkled brow. The sun seems ever to cast o'er thee Strange sunlight's ceaseless charm. Greece rises at thy glance; and Youth and Beauty linger Beside thee just to kiss one hand or one white finger, And Life's young red lips kiss thy rounded arm.— I wander through the crowd. I wander gloomy-hearted. Then just as if the sun had on a sudden parted Dense leaves that interlace And smiled with gracious eyes adown the leafy narrows, I weary with the points of daily pain's mute arrows Turn round,—and on a sudden, lo! thy face. III. “BEYOND” Thy springlike spirit has stolen from very Spring the power Whereby he clothes in robes of leaf and bud and flower Each new year without fail. Not even Death, I think, could meet thee and not tremble, Yea, surely he would turn, and sorrow and dissemble: At sight of thy flushed cheek his hand would quail. It seems to me that thou hast endless life within thee; That never heart of man, nor poet's heart, must win thee, But souls of flowers and seas: The living voice of Spring within the woods and mountains; The laughter of the morn in rivers and in fountains: The deathless love-song of the thornless breeze: These are thine own.—But I,—what can I bring but sadness? Thou gazest at the plain with young heart full of gladness, The plain so bright with flowers: I see beyond the plain the solemn hills ascending Height beyond awful height, with black crags never ending And snow-capped vast indomitable towers. Life's joys are all thine own, its every sunniest pleasure: While I with only love for sunshine and for treasure Gaze at thee, rapt and fond. Yet ever is it true that thou art gazing only At the broad flowerful plain,—while I with vision lonely (So lonely!) mark the unscaled rocks beyond. IV. “NEVER TIRED?” And art thou never tired of poems, and of singing?— “Nay! not more tired than Spring of merry bright birds winging Along the woods their way. A woman never tires of love, so it be endless: The summer, full of flowers, would feel forlorn and friendless With one flower less on one acacia spray. “A woman never tires of love, so it be tireless: A woman never tires till passion's soul be fireless And song's heart void of flame. What, do my eyes not speak? Then must my lips make plainer That Song is ever sweet, a gentle-eyed retainer Who follows on the path where Love's feet came “Sing on; and sing of me. Are still my eyes a wonder? Sing till the hushed birds part the leafy boughs in sunder To listen to thy song. A woman's gentle soul of love is never weary: Lo! lover, how the dark with songless hand and dreary Will seek to claim me for its own ere long! “Sing, ere the night be here.”—Song woke at her sweet warning, And with the heart of birds and with the wings of morning Stormed through the sunlit skies:— For song can never cease, while dark and pure and tender, Full of the soul of love, and full of light and splendour, Shine ever through song's heart her unchanged eyes. V. IN THE LATER DAYS So many poets lived, and died, and never found thee!— How countless are the hearts whose loving song had crowned thee Had they but seen thy face!— Now in the later days, when doubt and sorrow darken, And when to music weird the pain-crowned poets hearken, For one Time has reserved a nobler place. In these the later days, when through the mad world ringing With shock and clash of strife strange sound of fiery singing Eddies, swift wave on wave; In these the later days, when some are chanting only The soul of man laid waste, and passion's heart left lonely,— While some sing love-songs to the wan-lipped grave; In these the later days, when kings and thrones are falling And when across the waves the fierce storm-birds are calling And answering, one by one; When Revolution's tides across the path are foaming; When whispers, not of love, thrill through the green-leafed gloaming And tempests threaten God and mock the sun; In these wild later days, when all is dark and boding; When deadly thoughts are hurled like deadliest shells exploding On pale belief and creed; Strong help and high delight it is to hold a treasure Untouched by all the storm—a gift that none may measure— A task to which none other may succeed. Through all the storms I hear thy gentle soft voice speaking: Amid the fiery rain of storm-bolts round us shrieking I listen for thy tread: Thou wouldst remain unchanged though all the world around thee Fell at the trump of doom. The love whose strong hand crowned thee Would hold thee scatheless though the world lay dead. Great help and pure delight it is to worship theeward:— Like turning heart and glance no longer foamward, seaward, But up some valley-glen Full of gold gorse and grass and gentle pink-belled heather, Full of the sense of sun and windless summer weather,— Then, strengthened, meeting the grey waves again. Such is the peace thou bring'st.—In this wild stormy season, Full of the sound of strife and hints of wrath and treason, It is most glad and sweet To have on me bestowed the priceless charge to sing thee, To love thee and to crown,—to worship thee and bring thee Flowers gathered from betwixt the warriors' feet. Keats, Shelley, Marlowe,—these would, each, have perished, willing, If only through their hearts thy voice had once gone, thrilling Those fiery hearts to praise. They lived and sang and died, yet never never knew thee! Their swift song followed not, nor might their love pursue thee: They died, and, dying, panted for thy gaze. VI. THE OLD DREAM The lonely weary stars that never loved before And who were wont across the loveless dark to pour Sad solitary rays Woke up for thee, and brought their gleaming crowns of gold And gave thee all their dreams,—strange love-dreams that of old Lighted old nights and days. The flowers that never loved brought all their bloom and wonder, And tender buds for thee broke green soft sheaths in sunder Eager thine eyes to meet.— And I thy poet bring the dreams that once forsook me, Now caught and clasped again,—the old love-dream that shook me And made youth's wild heart beat. And now if I lose thee, I lose not half my being But all,—and pass through life with gaze no longer seeing Things sweet or glad or fair.— A man gives, when he gives, with absolute devotion. Youth's love is as a stream; but man's is a wild ocean Whose large crests shudder through the trembling air. Youth's love is very sweet: but man's is very strong. Youth's singing hath its charm: man's singing is a song Full of the storm-wind's power. Youth's lips are very sweet: a man's lips are as fire And life and death he holds subject to his desire And grasps them as a woman grasps a flower. VII. THY SOUL Not love that shifts and veers, not love that wanes and passes, Not love wherewith the light wind woos the fickle grasses In summer on the lea; Not love such as the love the wayward springtide brings us Nor likened to the love June's laughing sweet hand flings us,— Not such love bring I thee! I know each passing gleam, each fleeting shadow and light Within thine eyes, or on thy face or forehead white, And long—God knows I long!— To hold thee for mine own: and yet I love thee more Than any poet loved who ever loved before Because I love thy pure soul more than song. I love thee more than songs of face and form and feature.— Daily the soft veil shifts upon the face of Nature: The violet flees the rose: The green leaf flees the red; the love of Nature changes: The wild sea's restless heart from cloud to sea-bird ranges: Each warm wind's lips can melt the mountain's snows. More than strong words can say, though they be strong and eager (Beside the truth of love the sweetest words sound meagre!) I love thine eyes to see. But I with life and death and pain, firm-lipped and fearless, Have wrestled, that thy soul, so passionate and peerless, Might through eternity belong to me. VIII. SONG I Will God at last give me this one sweet thing,— That thy young lips should touch the lips that sing? II That thy young heart should wake a song in me More glad than morning's to the dark cold sea? III If thou canst love me, let thy love abide Unchanged for ever. Be my light and guide! IV But give no love that thou wilt take away. Turn not the sea's whole blue to waste wild grey! V O love of loves, my very singing dies Before the strange sweet light that fills thine eyes. VI Let me—what tenderer sweeter thing could be?— Die at the hands and at the lips of thee! IX. A LOVE-SONG Because thou hast not made me smile, but thou Hast made me weep, I know that I shall love thee even as now When death brings sleep. Because at last I tremble as I fall Before Love's feet, I know I love thee, sweetheart, more than all Who made life sweet. Because at last I sorrow and am afraid And dread Love's hand,— Because an agony lest loveless shade Blot out Love's land Possesses me,—I know that all my heart Is thine indeed, And that strong love of thee, not love of Art, Is now my creed. I know that thou hast changed my being quite And made it strong; Thou with the coal-black hair and eyes whose light Is light of song. I know that thou hast made me pure and brave; Turn not, nor flee: Take thou not back the priceless gift Love gave: Absorb thou me. Hold me and thrill me with thy wondrous eyes Till time is dead; Till the last sunset's flush across wild skies Fades out, blood-red. For never since I met them—never yet— Have mine eyes turned From thine. The light thou didst within them set Has duly burned. And death will find me watching still thine eyes, Not watching things About me,—trembling shores or tottering skies Or golden wings. Hold me; oh, hold me ever, till the grave Close over me. Cast me not back to wander like a wave O'er boundless sea. For thee I love with all my strength of soul. Lo! at thy feet While years flit on and changeful seasons roll O love, O sweet, I rest,—as I have rested never yet. Be true to me. Eyes, gaze through mine till mine own eyes have met Eternity. X. KNOWN, YET UNKNOWN Because I know thee well, yet never quite, I love thee so. Most sweet thou art, yet strange. Each morning's light New blossoms blow,— And every morn within thine eyes the light Of unseen things Shines. It were loss to apprehend thee quite. Thy mystery flings A new and ever newer charm around Thy being here. While others weary, thou art ever found More and more dear. XI. MY QUEEN SONG I Of all girls' faces sweet and very fair There is but one I love.—Can all the stars that gild the air Put out the sun? II Can all the flowers that fill the garden-bed Dismay the rose? Nay! Love's hand only over one sweet head His glory throws. III There are fair flowers and faces—that I know— Many to see. But only one whose beauty lays me low; But one for me. IV Eyes meet my own. They never hold me now: Their spell is o'er. But thine eyes hold me. At thy feet I bow For evermore. V There are fair faces. Only one for me: One mouth, I ween: One royal look of tenderest sovereignty: One love, one queen. XII. “NOW LET ME REST” SONG I I feel that I have all my life been seeking, Seeking for thee. Now let me rest, and listen to Love speaking At length to me. II Just let me listen to Love's silver laughter That rings in thine. Just let me see thine eyes, and never after For others pine. III Just let me listen to the music flowing, Love, through thy voice; Watch the sweet flush upon thy bright cheek glowing; In thee rejoice. IV Just let me rest as if it were for ever, Love, in thy sight, And dream that death and parting cannot sever Nor sorrow blight. V Just let me, sweetest heart that ever found me (For love's own sake!) Dream that thy passionate deathless love has crowned me And never wake. XIII. SUPREME REPOSE I Now all old storms of passionate emotion Are no more stirred. It is as if the whole Atlantic ocean Loved one sea-bird! II It is as if the wild unbroken anguish That surged through me Had found new peaceful wings that droop and languish O'er summer sea. III Old thoughts, old dreams, in thee have found their haven, And deep repose Sinks o'er the heart upon whose walls are graven Strange prints of woes. IV Upon me rest unutterable falleth When thou art near: Peace from the heaven of heavens with soft voice calleth When thee I hear. V Not even a kiss I ask: I only covet That I may weep. Thine heart I ask; but just that I may love it And fall asleep. XIV. “BE THOU HAPPY!” I Oh, be thou happy! Let me ever know At least this thing— That thoughts and dreams of mine that worked me woe Have made thee sing! II There is not any man upon the earth, Beneath God's sky, With songs upon his lips and seeming mirth, So weary as I. III There is not any woman on the earth So sweet as thou: Oh that my pain may magnify thy mirth, Strong Love knows how! IV If thou art happy, I am half content For aye to be The weariest living soul. Mine eyes are bent Alone on thee. V And while I hear thy laughter softly ring, And thine eyes gleam, I just have heart enough to love and sing And sing and dream. XV. SUPREME DEVOTION I If I can love thee with supreme devotion, Wilt thou love me, And mingle with my heart's wild throbbing ocean Thy silver glee? II Lo! love is ne'er content. Love longeth ever Itself to bring. Love's one despair is this—that it can never Its whole soul fling III Down at the loved one's feet. How small and grievous The gifts we make! Slight piteous wreaths Time's grudging slow hands weave us, And these we take IV And crown the souls we love. But if our power And will were one, Each star our hands would bring, and every flower, And every sun. XVI. THE ONLY DEATH I When thou didst speak of death, it seemed to me The only death would be the loss of thee. It is not death that hurts, nor wounds nor pain; This would be death—to see no more again Thine eyes. There is no other death for me Now left, O loved one, than the loss of thee. II. For I have so completely lost in thine My life, that now it seemeth no more mine But just a life that floweth, love, through thee, As the warm land-stream mingleth with the sea. Thou art my life; and life means now to me The life, the beauty, and the love of thee. XVII. A VISION I saw a company whom God had crowned.— They held the post of danger through the day And died at night upon the blood-stained ground And over them the moon soared gaunt and grey And the wild leaves fled past with wailing sound: But now, in heaven, their pain had passed away And they were crowned and victors. Yet their eyes Were full of tears. They knew not why there rang Along the serried armies of the skies So vast a shout. Their joy was like a pang, So unexpected was it. Wild surprise Smote through their dumb hearts as the angels sang “Glory to these, who held the one chief post And held it to the end,—and died at night And won the battle for the whole great host Yet saw no victory when their souls took flight Across the red-stained meadows.” Too engrossed With their own task to watch the waning light They tarried till the end,—till each one fell Prone at his post. Now unto each God says: “Soul, thou didst win the fight. Thou hast done well.” And, as each hears with wonder in his gaze, Each answers, suffering having cast out pride: “Lord, I did nought. I only loved and died.” XVIII. A PRAYER To love is heaven, and not to love is hell.— To give sweet love away Eternally and boundlessly is well. For this alone I pray! I ask the power of loving without bound: No limit there should be. If thine arms, love, may never close me round, Let my arms cover thee! Let my strong love and limitless embrace Of fiery fervent heart Be ever round about thee,—in each place; Blessing, where'er thou art. Let me on earth and through all worlds to be Be just the one who so Completely loved that he saw nought but thee; Who loved till love was woe. —That so thine image may not quit my side Through all eternity: While I thank God that I have lived and died Madly in love with thee. XIX. “YET MORE SWEET” Let me just watch thine eyes. If nothing more, Yet let this one thing be! Is it forbidden to the throbbing shore To watch the clear-eyed sea? May not the green woods, dark and full of woe, Watch, once, their bright birds' flight?— Oh let me love thee, watch thee, guard thee, so: As guards its stars the night. Be thou one star within my dreary night; One sweet wave on my sea; One woman with superb eyes full of light, Light ever turned on me! If all the world of women came and fell One by one at my feet And offered me strange gifts too sweet to tell, It would be yet more sweet, O love, to me to watch thy clear brown eyes (Though no gift else were ours!) Than to possess all hearts beneath the skies, And win those hearts' best flowers. XX. THE WOMAN AND THE GIRL Sometimes I see the girl within thine eyes; Sometimes the woman there Is manifest. So April's tender skies Predict June's perfect air. I sometimes mark, thee watching (and my days Are spent in watching thee) Thy perfect woman-face. I seem to gaze On what shall surely be. I seem to see the woman full of power,— No more the girl most sweet, But the magnificent and perfect flower. I fall before thy feet Thee worshipping with wonder and with awe, For years will further grace And perfect what is now without a flaw, Thy royal young pure face. XXI. ART AND LOVE I used to love fair Art with golden wings; I loved her like a bride; I met her by blue streams and forest springs; I wandered at her side. The sunsets held her, and the morning's gold Circled her peerless hair: Deep fern and heather draped the summer wold, And buoyant Art was there. And in sweet music Art's sweet spirit spoke; And over the wild sea Her face like sudden lustrous morning broke Triumphant upon me. So all my youth was passed. I worshipped her, Fair Art, with love supreme, And brought her all my hopes, and I laid bare Before her every dream. Art was my goddess, tall and ample-eyed,— The queen my spirit sought. I rested at her feet, and would have died To please the queen in aught. But now Art's form doth change into the form That I love better still. Art's marble hand is cold, but thine is warm: Art's stern touch cannot thrill. Thy young touch thrills me, and thy deep brown eyes Make me forget to sing Aught else. So sacred depths of summer skies Drown out the dreams of spring. I have loved Art with love beyond all speech And laboured in her fane, And sought her secret inmost heart to reach,— Her deepest soul to gain. But now I bring my deepest love of Art And give that love to thee. Lo! she and I are strangers and must part: New sails are on the sea. There are fair crowns of labour and of birth; Let this my one crown be— I loved Art best of all things upon earth, Yet loved Art less than thee! XXII. THE POET AND THE LADY THE POET Thou canst not understand this heart of mine: Thou art so fair. Can the white daisy apprehend the pine Whose branches wear Crowns of the stormy stars that through them shine And stormy air? Thou canst not understand how I love thee! How canst thou know The storm and travail of the ceaseless sea And all its woe? Long centuries must it take thine heart to me Quite close to grow. If thou couldst understand my whole soul now, It would be pain. I would not add one wrinkle to thy brow; Ever remain Upon my life's tree the one blossoming bough:— That is love's gain. THE LADY I am content, if I can bring the pine Some gleams of blue! Part the deep dark-tressed boughs, and softly shine The thick leaves through. If I can only apprehend your Art, Know what you are, And in some dark sad corner of your heart Create a star. If I can only bring you some delight, Some bliss to win; Pierce with glad rays your spirit's stormy night And enter in. For God made woman's eyes to comfort those Whose souls despair. For this God made her sweet mouth like a rose, And set love there: That whoso seeth her should know that rest Is yet in store For even the weariest soul within her breast For evermore. XXIII. GOD'S YEARNING “Because I, being God, am deathless King Of all men born, Let the world's measureless wild sorrow bring Its every thorn. “Because I am so strong that even the wings Of lightning fail Before me, let me help the humblest things,— A rosebud pale. “Because I have the godlike power to shun Death's sombre night, Let me the sun-bright pass beyond the sun, Me, lord of light. “Because, O world, thou hatest me indeed And hate is loss, Let me for thy sweet erring strange sake bleed Upon the cross. “O world, thine eyes are full of wandering light: I love to see The glory in thine eyes that shall wax bright And full of me, “When in the end the final work is done And, one far morn, Thy fields and gardens smile beneath the sun Without one thorn. “That thou, world, mayest be saved, let me be lost: That thou mayest rise, Let me the sinless pay sin's fullest cost Before thine eyes. “O world, sweet world, the very heart of God Yearns over thee! Wild anguish storms God's cloudless vast abode, Eternity. “Wild love and anguish storm the heart divine: O world forlorn, I kiss the hands that round my forehead twine Thorn upon thorn.” XXIV. LOVE'S OTHER HALF Most sweet it were that thou shouldst care for me (If only it could be so!)— And yet my passionate deep love for thee Has its own crown to show. The half of love that thou couldst give away Would make my whole heart beat. Yet I may love thee more with each new day: Love's other half is sweet. XXV. A DYING POET'S LOVE When Heine lay upon his bed of pain Helpless, the end being near, Love sought his couch, and sought it like a fane, Brightening the prospect drear. Young love was near him on that dying bed. A young girl's gentle heart Yearned over Heine's world-worn weary head And worshipped Heine's Art. He loved her with the love intense and wild A genius-spirit brings: She on this earth of ours as yet a child,— He 'mid the next world's kings. So when he died, their spirits could not part. She held him with her bloom; She held him with her girlish young live heart: He held her from the tomb. XXVI. TWO DREAMS On one wild day when rain swirled round in showers, I dreamed that thou wast dead: That wandering grass and dreary grave-side flowers Circled thy dear dark head. I stretched out arms my vanished love to reach And groaned in wild despair: Then sank back into calm beyond all speech, Seeing that thou wast there. And yet another dream and weird I had, And it was pain to me.— It seemed that women loved me. Was I glad? Nay, I looked round for thee! Strange is it when one love so holds the heart, So maddens with its spell, That other love would carry hate's own dart,— Would be not heaven, but hell. XXVII. “IF ONLY THOU ART THERE!” We know not yet what heavenly love shall be, Save that it shall be sweet. Yet this I know: that utmost heaven on me Shines, when I hear thy feet. Heaven will be glad and full of calm to me, Dead will be all despair, If but my glance may fall again on thee,— If only thou art there! XXVIII. “BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD” I dreamed I followed thee across the stars; Thy sweet face beckoned me: Through strange cloud-masses, bursting vaporous bars, My spirit followed thee. The vast and desolate and treeless track Seemed just as nothing then; Nought if my spirit could but win thee back And hold thee once again. Stars faded into gloom, and new stars rose Upon my weary sight: Yet still I followed,—followed to the close Of the wild realms of night. And then I found thee,—in a land divine, Unknown, unseen, untrod; And clasped at length thy soul, and sealed it mine Before the throne of God. XXIX. PRAYER Though I be far, yet I can set in motion By prayer for thee A stronger force than sways the wildest sea, The fiercest ocean. Love passes into prayer, and desperate yearning That crosses space And brings our parted spirits face to face, All distance spurning. The soul who prays wields force by far the strongest Of forces all: He soonest wins love's topmost castle-wall Who prays the longest. XXX. “ETERNAL BOYHOOD” I Eternal boyhood deepens day by day As the heart older grows: The man who loves a rose Is ever immortal, though the hair wax grey. II The man who loveth thee, O thou most sweet incarnate spirit of Spring, Becomes a strong and age-defying king Of heaven and earth and sea. III No man who loves thee, sweetheart of my soul, Can e'er be aught but young, For Spring's self on thy tongue Lingers for ever, while swift seasons roll. IV Thee never words may praise Fitly, for thou art far beyond all words,— Just as the summer singing of the birds Outstrips our choicest lays. V I never shall find words in which to say (That is my one despair!) How past all sweet praise fair Thou art to me,—and lovelier day by day. VI I never shall find song Divine enough, my beautiful, for thee. When we stand close beside a white may-tree Words do the sweet bloom wrong. VII Song, once I thought, could never fail to show The fervent heart within: Yet, God knows, it seems sin Almost to sing of thee—I love thee so! VIII My beautiful, my queen, My sweetest of all sweet things upon earth,— My sovereign woman with the silver mirth, The deep glance and serene,— IX The harp falls from my hand! God only knows (The God who gave to me To love and look on thee) How my whole soul upon thee doth repose. XXXI. JACOB AND RACHEL As Jacob served seven years For dark-eyed Rachel, and the long years seemed Nought for the love he bare her as they gleamed Past, full of spring's wild tears And summer's passion,—so it seems to me That I have, through strange suffering, served for thee Not seven years as decreed But seventy times seven years, and more indeed! XXXII. LOVE AND ART Help thou me with my Art! That thus the beauty which I worship so May flush the world's sad cheeks with summer glow And comfort many a heart. Clear is our duty high. Thou hast the gift of beauty; I can sing; We have to bless the wintry world with spring And sunlight, thou and I. Help me the world to teach. Teach me all lessons gracious with thine eyes: Be ever, love, the most divine surprise That e'er moved songful speech. Teach me love's secrets deep. That I may move the world, inspire thou me And fill my spirit with the sense of thee Till sweet thoughts make me weep. Love must not make us blind. We have to help the world and make it glad: Thou by thy beauty, I by song must add New riches to mankind. Just gaze at me, and I Will sing so that the world must gaze at thee And catch the passionate refrain from me, Prolong it when I die. XXXIII. A POET'S SOUL Eternal youth is thine.— The man who loveth thee Grows ageless like the sea And youthful like the changeless mountain-line. Love gives his vast eternal youth to God. The man who pours his soul Deep into Love's control God's temple-floors hath trod. The man who loveth thee, O tenderest living thing, Is crowned immortal king Of past and present and futurity. The man who loveth with the love that looks Straight into Love's own eyes The threatening death defies And finds fresh water-brooks. Others may love thee well. But I love thee, dear heart, With the strong soul of Art And with a force transcending heaven and hell. I give thee just the wildest sweetest thing That under God's blue sky Can sing or throb or sigh; A poet's soul I bring: Its fiery hopes that rise And follow thee, and still Would carry out Love's will Though Death stood in the way with lurid eyes. XXXIV. ‘ACROSS THE STARS” I Though thou art far away Yet, sweetheart, I can pray For thee.—No leagues of thunder-traversed air Can bar the passage of the wings of prayer. II I have no strength nor power, My tender one white flower, To hold thee safe. The Power that sways the sea Will for a season take the charge from me. III The Power that holds the sky Though my arms be not nigh Will see that through thine eyes no sad thoughts gleam But only thine own soul's divine sunbeam. IV God bless and keep thee, dear! Love whisper in thine ear!— Hope mocks at distance, snaps all chains and bars, And pure love reaches thee across the stars. XXXV. THE SUPREME LOVE Affections, passions, many there may be In the soul's life. But one Great love brings absolute fierce sovereignty: Stars tremble at the sun. The great love gathers in its wide embrace Affections, passions all. Where there were many, now shines but one face; The old love-temples fall. This is the wonder of surpassing love; Its marvel and its doom. A sudden wind sweeps grimly from above And leaves one flower in bloom: One, only one. Man rises to his height Of being when he knows That love for one alone can flood life's night With the great stars' repose. I have not loved, nor shall I love again, While stars still kiss the sea, With gleam of joy, or chance of awful pain, Sweetheart, as I love thee. XXXVI. “LOVE'S INVINCIBILITY” It surely must be sweet To be loved, sweetheart, as my soul loves thee? It must make yet more blue the bluest sea, More swift the summer's feet! It must make every tender flower beside The river thou dost seek Smile almost, almost speak: It must add radiance to the water wide. It must make every day More beautiful, my beauty, unto thee: I have not lived for nothing if through me Love doth his gifts convey. It must make, surely, all a woman's soul Expand and bud and bloom; As the sun draws perfume From every flower by his divine control. To know that love is thine, Love pure and passionate and all-supreme,— This must make life to thee one sunny dream And all the world divine. If it is sweet to love, sweet it must be To thee to be loved so, And through all life to go Guarded by love's invincibility. XXXVII. A PRAYER FOR THE FUTURE That thou wilt faithful be, and full of love and sweetness; That thou wilt let fair Love to exquisite completeness Round off our marriage-song, I pray. I pray that through the years that stretch before us God's sun may ever shine with tenderer bounty o'er us: I pray that my love's strength may make thee strong. I pray that every day, as day past day goes gliding, I may be at thy side with gentlest love and guiding, With tenderest voice and heart,— Bestowing upon thee the love that I have lavished On stars and flowers and waves, bright-hearted things soon ravished Away by time's hand as the years depart. I pray that thou mayest know—that God himself may teach thee— How vast a fight I fought to win thee, love, and reach thee; How awful was the strain. I pray that thou mayest know that if my soul hath won thee The power that cast its spell around thine heart and on thee Was just the power of love and desperate pain:— The power that moves the stars,—that reaches God and binds him; Yea, in the farthest bower of mistiest heaven it finds him And brings him to our side: The power that shone through Christ when on the blood-stained gibbet He hung for hours, that love might once for all exhibit Its deathless kinghood through the man who died. And oh that I may be for ever and for ever Thy patient lover true—lose heart and sweet hope never— For this, O love, I pray: That I may win thine heart so utterly and sweetly That thou mayest never need, content in me completely, To turn, e'en for one hour, thine eyes away. I pray that God will give my heart the power to hold thee And my strong arms the right in tenderest clasp to fold thee O sweetheart, O my queen! I pray that I may be thy leader and thy poet Bearing all pain for thee, that thou mayest then forego it And mayest securely on my strong soul lean. O darling of my heart,—if I to-day may name thee So, once, and may for once by sweetest title claim thee— O darling of my soul— I pray that I may win from God the dreadful power In spite of hell and death, to hold thee, O my flower, And win for thee, with thee, new life's white goal. That I may faithful be—to death if it be needed: That ever by thy heart my love-voice may be heeded I pray,—that I may be Each morning more in love, and every morning truer, Even as the sky to God is every morning bluer And bluer all the strange depths of the sea. XXXVIII. “LIFE AND DEATH” This was the awful thing,—that once for all I knew it— That God was in the flame, and gleaming ever through it His panoply supreme. Seven times hot was the flame, but God was in the fire: So through the furnace rang, e'en there, my desperate lyre And agony became like love's own dream. Yet awful was the place—I, passing through pain's portal, Grew for a season mixed with hearts and spirits immortal: I fought,—and held my breath, Knowing that I at length was fighting not for pastime But for the love of thee, and fighting for the last time, And that, this time, the stakes were life and death. XXXIX. THE ENDING OF LOVE'S QUEST For thee I have achieved hard things and dread.—I know it. But what were heart of man, and, least of all, of poet, If this he could not do? The impossible to love is possible, and easy. The God who first began his flower-work by the daisy Conceived at last his rose of fieriest hue. So I who first began my love-work by soft singing Of love that passed away, now send a strong song ringing Along the fields of air. I who have sung of charm of meadow-sweet and daisy And stooped to gather buds in morning's uplands hazy Halt now at thee,—and nothing else is fair. XL. “IF I HAD LOST THEE!” I never should have sung again, if I had lost thee! If the dark winds of time had seized on thee and tost thee Like some sad autumn leaf Aside, why then my soul would never once have spoken Again in music sweet, nor the grim silence broken Of helpless deadliest hopeless speechless grief. The saddest sorrow of all is sorrow that is speechless, Tearless, and motionless; like some vast ocean, beachless Yet void of waves and sound:— A sea that none may plumb, a waste that none may travel, Barred by strange walls of fog that never breeze doth ravel, Sunless and moonless,—and with no known bound. XLI. “THE HIGHEST GOAL” Not for the Stage,—nay, thou art made for higher regions! What hath the rose to say to lesser pale flower-legions? What hath the stainless air To say to wreaths of cloud that linger in the valley? When round about thy path the gold-winged angels rally Wilt thou be less than they, who art more fair? Thou art a poet's love. Be worthy of thy poet. Rise to thy woman's height: abjure not, nor forego it, The whiteness of thy soul. Lo! there are thousands left to seek the valley-fountains: O deathless love of mine, be ours the lordly mountains And ours the highest and the heavenliest goal. XLII. THY GIRLISH THOUGHTS A poet's purest thoughts that heavenward turn, and seaward, Are never pure enough, sweet love, when turning theeward: For thou dost put to scorn By thine unconscious white pure girlhood every hour That I have spent in dreams, and every fancied flower In the dim mystic bardic cloudland born. Man's purest thoughts are nought. Thy girlish thoughts are purer.— Upon the mountain-height of dreams with footstep surer Thou treadest. Yea, to me Thou bringest back lost dreams that once waved plumage saintly. And yet these shadow forth thy girlish heart but faintly: The purest is not pure enough for thee. XLIII. THE VICTOR What are my fairest songs beside thee real and queenly? What is the realm of Art wherethrough men move serenely For many and many a year Compared to thee?—Art fails beside thee and before thee: And, if men praise my work, I hear not, but adore thee; My tenderest words reach not thy beauty, dear. The tenderest words of man, be he ten times inspired, Would fail to render thee, to touch the height desired: Art faints before thy gaze. When all my work had failed, God's conquering hand, thee moulding, Set thee before the world, that every heart, beholding My work contemned, the Victor's work might praise. XLIV. “THINE HIGHEST LOVE” I crave thine highest love.—No mere swift temporal passion, That gives, then passes on in boyish girlish fashion; No momentary thing; But love that ever grows to higher tenderer beauty: The love whose heart is one with the strong soul of duty: The love whereat the stars rejoice and sing. The love of thy deep soul. The love that, daily growing, Sees ever, as the path, along the mountains going, Winds upward day by day, New heights of sacred joy before its footstep gleaming: The love whose heart is one with woman's softest dreaming: The love that triumphs when the hair turns grey. This I would ask of thee—The love that, far from winning And leaving, rather aims for ever at beginning: The love whose birth is new Each morn and every eve: the love that knows no sorrow For, if the night be sombre, it can create to-morrow New light, and blossoms fair with freshest dew. XLV. FLOWER AND FRUIT Why did I not know thee, instead of flowers and mountains? Thy voice is sweeter far than voice of the old fountains: Thou hast a tenderer charm Than all the dreams of bliss Youth worshipped as he wandered Along the flower-hung roads, and sang of love, and pondered. White were the waves. But whiter is thine arm. Why did I not know thee, instead of wooing sadness? Why did I not woo thee, and, wooing thee, woo gladness And infinite delight? If I had only known that thou wast waiting—Known it! If I by but one hint had only once been shown it!— But God keeps all his best gifts out of sight. And now I see thy face revealed with sudden splendour, And all the pent-up love of the long years I render And homage absolute. But is it, love, too late? Will God who kept the flower Waiting through year on year till this triumphant hour Hold back from me the more triumphant fruit? XLVI. “FORSAKE ME NOT” It gladdens all my soul that thou dost choose to tarry, Love, by my side. With thee, all thrusts of pain I parry: Without thee, I am nought. With thee, I am a god, and full of life and power: Without thee, I am lost,—and never one song-flower Without thee would to the world's feet be brought. Forsake me not. My heart is thine as never any Strong heart of singer yet was given and held, though many Strong singers' hearts have sighed. Hold thou my heart; 'tis thine. Stretch out thine hand and take it. Wilt thou redeem and heal,—or past all wild words break it? God, time, and thine own soul, love, must decide. XLVII. THY REWARD If thou art true to me in spite of pain and danger, What wilt thou gain, O love? The sweet divine sense, stranger And stronger far than grief, That thou hast saved a soul, and saved that soul for ever, And added to my crown one flower that withers never,— One deathless never-fading laurel-leaf. This thou wilt gain:—A love that never words can measure; My whole deep heart for mine of never-ceasing treasure (If thou dost value this!) This thou shalt gain:—The sense that when earth's loves are going Thy golden cup of love is full to overflowing; The sense that thou hast saved me by thy kiss. XLVIII. AGONY I Is it not agony beyond all words That thou art not with me? Worse than the loss to the white wild sea-birds Of their white restless sea? II Is there one single hour by day, by night When I grieve not and sigh? Longing for thee, as for my very light,— And longing, till I die! III Art thou in pain? Hast thou one moment's grief,— One little pang at times? O ripple striking on the river-reef, Think of the sea's wild chimes! IV O tender ripple of a girlish heart, Remember how through me Pours the remorseless anguish, for my part, Of the despairing sea! V I dread the morning and I dread the night Because thou art not there: I know (and gladly know) thy pain is light By what I have to bear. XLIX. “UPON THE SEA!” Fight while the timbers shriek, the rigging wails: Thou knowest not what vast issues may depend Upon thy courage and thy faith, O friend— Fight while the hoarse shot whizzes through the sails. Nail to the mast-head with defiant nails The flag that only love's own breeze can bend: Fight the brave vessel till the very end,— While angry powder-smoke sweeps round in gales. Fight while the ship rocks under thee,—and then, When timber parts from timber, smile and thank God in the face of all the world of men That standing-room is left thee on one plank: And when that plank fails, should this last thing be, Why then in God's name stand upon the sea! L. “JOY AND TEARS” When I perceived that my love would not change But last through all the years And over all far heights of being range, The thought brought joy and tears. Deep joy to think that in thy clear brown eyes I might gaze evermore: That love would quite outlast the solemn skies, Outlive the sea and shore. Sorrow to think that it might be in vain; That love deep as the sea Might live eternally and live in pain,— For wilt thou still love me? LI. SONG I To-day thou hast the wings, O love of mine, And over the sea's grey Thou canst flee quite away Leaving my lyre to weep, my soul to pine. II Young art thou, and thou hast the wondrous wings Of girlhood, and the air Of summer finds thee fair And round about thee all the wildwood sings. III Oh, what can hold thee? Can I stay thy flight? Oh love alone can hold Thy young plumes fleet and bold And force thy wandering wild feet to alight. IV I have no other power,—yea, nought but this; Love,—love, and love alone, To draw thee from thy throne;— Love in my eyes, and on my lips love's kiss. LII. GREAT AND SMALL Not only to the stars the star-God who pervadeth The solemn outspread heavens, and broodeth o'er and shadeth The wide skies with his hand,— Not only to the stars the star-God's word is given: Not only to the blue illimitable heaven: Not only to the sea and flower-starred land: The God who sows the void with stars, and sows the meadows With fragrant blossom-stars, and fills the soft June-shadows With wind-breaths sweet and mild,— The God who holds the whole vast cosmos in vibration And hurls through war on war mad nation upon nation Is pledged to help the humblest human child. LIII. “THE LORD WATCH BETWEEN ME AND THEE!” May Love be guardian over heart and heart, Though none beside us stand! May love be with us, when we are apart, And keep hand locked in hand! Though thee I see not, yet thine eyes I see: They keep me true and strong. Though me thou see'st not, let the message be Still with thee of my song. May love keep watch between us!—May his strength Keep both our spirits true! Till, storm and thunder past, we reach at length The sky's eternal blue. LIV. JEWELS Jewels!—Can I not bring thee all the light Of heaven's fair farthest stars for diadem? Can I not give thee the dread soul of them And clothe thee with the wild robes of the night? Can I not win for thee in thickest fight (Where giant spears and swords love's onset stem) Gifts that a goddess-heart might not contemn,— Gifts sweet to love's most penetrating sight?— Can I not clothe thee, O thou woman fair, With love for mantle, and with song for crown Crown thee,—and bring thee, through life's stormiest air, To peace and, it may be, high pure renown? Can I not bring thee gifts of love and praise, From love's soft dawning till the end of days? LV. “IF THOU WILT LOVE ME, LOVE” Thou art my youth.—My youth lies far behind the mountains: Unmeasured years of pain between me and the fountains Of young life bar the way: To-day's November sun seems softly to remind me Of strong old summer suns that in the years behind me Gilded green leaves on many a forest-spray. But thou art youth. To love old age is but a liar. He cannot dim love's flame, he cannot quench love's fire; For all his strength, not he! Old age thinks scorn of love, and deems love like a river Whose blue soft tides at cold advance of age will shiver:— Love laughs,—and lo! love's streamlet is a sea. If thou wilt love me, love,—not with a love which passes, But with a love which stays when winter smites the grasses And roses one by one: If thou wilt love me, love,—with sweet love very tender, The love which at death's gate sees through that gate the splendour Which robes the rising of another sun: If thou wilt love me, love,—with solemn love undying,— Then I shall hear the heights to the far heights replying And song will thrill the skies: If thou wilt love me, love, I never shall grow older, Nor watch the sunset-light upon the hills wax colder, For heaven and earth will take light from thine eyes. LVI. THY WOMANHOOD And dost thou think that I am blind to this— That half thine heart I cannot see? That thou shouldst just a little love is bliss: Yet much is hidden, woe is me! Thy glorious woman-heart all unrevealed Waits,—waits in silence soft and deep. Thy soul as yet is like a form concealed And wrapped in robes of magic sleep. Thy perfect soul is what I long to win: Thy perfect woman-heart indeed. Ope thy soul's gates that Love may enter in; To song the entrance-right concede. Give me thy future. Lovely as thou art, Yet lovelier thou wilt one day be. I dream of this as Spring's enamoured heart Dreams of the summer stars and sea. As Spring's heart dreams of unarisen flowers And of soft summer joys unseen And of love-laughter ringing through deep bowers As yet but touched by tenderest green, So I dream softly, but with high delight —Delight that fills with stars my gloom— Of what thou wilt be,—even yet more bright One day, and full of softer bloom. I know how very little, love, I see Of the deep silent heart within: But keep that heart a sacred trust for me; Give love the chance that heart to win. Wait. Wait till God and Love the moment bring When soul may leap forth soul to meet. Pure love can rob time of its utmost sting And make the weariest hours most sweet. Give me thy soul,—not for this life alone, But for the years beyond the grave. When thou to perfect womanhood art grown, Let heart and glance unite to save. When thou art woman,—when thine eyes awake From girlish thoughts and springlike dreams,— Then let the splendour of love's morning break Around thee with triumphant gleams. When the pure spirit in thee is divine And fair and quite complete and strong, Place then thy woman's warm soft hand in mine And be song's soul. My soul is song. LVII. THE FRONTIER-POST On those who held the frontier-post And held it through the night What of divine new light Shall break when morning shows the golden coast And the new cliffs in sight? On those who gave their lives away For very love's own sake What wondrous dawn shall break Rose-flushed and splendid through the parting grey? What dead hopes shall awake? LVIII. ANOTHER YEAR Another year will soon spread speedy wings And pass into the darkness of dead things, But still the land is ours: The land of love is still our own to hold; Its blossoms white and blossoms of pure gold, And all the next year's flowers. All flowers and beauty of the coming year Are still mine own, for thou art with me, dear, Thou, chief of all things sweet. The old dead year may carry off its spoil: It matters not, for thy true hand can foil Death, and avert defeat. There is no death, if only love's fair land Be ours for ever; if, firm hand in hand, We face the future days. Death has no power when loving hearts are one, And winter gleams as with an August sun And lights flower-fragrant ways. Not only, love, the coming year is ours, But all the next world's unforeseen great flowers If God be good and we Faithful. All future time before us lies And fervent summers with unknown blue skies And blue unheard-of sea. Through pain and dark dread storms we have endured And this foretaste of victory secured; Love's fortress still we keep. Love's flag still flies above the topmost tower, And still thy watchman's cry from hour to hour Rings through life's sombre sleep. LIX. “THE ARMY BEHIND THE MAN” As in a trance I saw a human form.— The universe with peals of thunderous sound And forked red lightnings raged and clamoured round: Ten thousand waves, a white and angry swarm, Swept on him. Hell belched forth a poisonous storm Of fiends who sprang and danced from mound to mound, Mocking. For human sympathy he found Cold hearts and hands to meet love's hand-grasp warm. At first I groaned, and in my sorrow deep Despaired. “The lonely man is lost,” I said: “The universe is armed his soul to slay.” God touched my eyes, and I awoke from sleep And saw the spirit hosts that leader led Filling all time and space, and night and day. LX. LOVE'S SILENCE There is a love so deep it travels far Beyond the reach of words. E'en love-songs jar When the great depths are stirred. The blue vast heaven responds to God who made Its depths profound of awful light and shade Sometimes without one word. When heaven is full of love, no thunders leap Along the heights of the abysmal steep: Nay! all is silent then. There is a love so full of silent peace That even solemn stately love-chants cease Or are not heard of men. O love, be with me in my silent hours And gather sweeter than the old song-flowers With sympathy that knows That as a soul may be too glad to pray So even thus to love there comes a day When the gold song-gates close. Speech is not needed when the souls are one Nor battle-cry when all the strife is done (Yet, ah! the strife was long). O love, come closer than song's tenderest word, Closer than music! When no songs are heard, Be still the soul of song. LXI. OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND From shore to shore Far as the weariest aching sight can roam Billows that climb and burst, billows that roar; Wan leagues of sunless foam. If ever we Reach a new land of peace, of peace divine, The first green hills will rise beyond the sea, Beyond the waste of brine. Far out we sail: Far out of eyeshot of the former land. Round us the wandering white-winged sea-birds wail, A lonely weird strange band. They know not, these, The calm and beauty of the summer shore; The light and laughter of the leafy trees; The fragrance of the pine-wood floor. No dales are theirs Thyme-scented, gentle, full of chant of bees: Only the wild hoarse singing of the airs, The desolate trumpet of the seas. Yet triumph high They feel, those white-winged birds far out at sea. The green wave's curve is tenderer to the eye Sometimes than gleam of grass or tree. And we can share Those sea-birds' triumph and their wild delight, Feeling around their plumes the lonely air And the sweet lonely night. When trees and flowers Shine once more on us, they will be quite new, And other than the old forsaken bowers Will edge the undreamed-of blue. Our only hope (What hope for love but this?) is just to steer, While grim sea-breezes rock the quivering rope, Past reach of eye or ear. Then when the hills Rise, faintly glittering on another shore That unimagined other sunshine fills,— On whose white cliffs new billows roar,— With tearful eyes We shall mark forest-deeps loom forth again And with a sudden thrilling of surprise See summer flowers, and without pain. But out of sight Of trees and flowers and land to-day are we: Above us the great star-hung arch of night; Round us the grey-green wastes of sea. LXII. GOD AND MAN Of old God rested 'mid the heavenly flowers, Far from all sounds and sights of man's despair: The blue sky filled with light the deathless bowers And perfect peace was there. All pure delights were present to his hand: The stars at night were ministers sublime: Joy flooded like a stream the painless land That took no heed of time. Far-off man toiled amid the nether gloom, And woman wept, and death ruled bitterly. Ruin and dread destruction were man's doom; To love, and then to die. But Love arose and said, “While one man sighs Shall I contented dwell beyond the gloom? While sorrow walks the earth with burning eyes Or shudders at hope's tomb?” Strong Love stooped downward to the lowest hell, And made the deepest agony divine. Love said, “With even the saddest it is well Now, for their pain is mine.” And so it came to pass that man arose And blossoms bloomed upon the paths he trod: Yet all his joy (though man forgets) he owes To the deep pain of God. LXIII. MUTUAL LOVE The strength of man first storms the heart: But in the end the woman gives as well. Man's love first plays its urgent part; Man's passion sweeps wide-winged o'er valley and fell. First man pursues. With strength he seeks: For months he deems that no response is there. Then, on a sudden, rose-red cheeks!— He laughs, and kisses lips and throat and hair. This is love's reciprocity divine. Man loves,—and thinks the woman cold: But her pure heart is learning line by line Love-lore it may not yet unfold. Wait. Let the love-god slowly win the heart. One day the soft eyes full of tears Will speak a message past the reach of Art; Yet he may understand who hears. LXIV. CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS MINISTERS Some great unconscious ministers Love has: The stars and roses, and the summer air; The trefoil lurking 'mid the tufted grass; The blue flower-jewels in the corn's gold hair. But man stands forth as minister supreme, As conscious witness of the life divine, And says, “The life of God is not a dream; In very deed God's blood is mixed with mine.” While lightnings flash, and waves arise and break, And all creation seems in jeopardy,— While stormy thunder-throated doubts awake And spread dark wings o'er lurid wastes of sea,— Man stands upright, and conscious of his strength Claims kindred with the Love that holds the helm; That thrills throughout the universe's length, And that no thunder-batteries overwhelm. LXV. EVEN IN HEAVEN Not even in heaven, if heaven I e'er attain, A heaven bestrewed With flowers of joy, would peace within me reign. My risen eager spirit would Stoop downward ever through the golden air Seeking for thee And pause e'en in the midst of holiest prayer If thou hadst need of me. No high delight of heaven, no towers of gold, Would make me glad If thou wert lonely on the earth,—a-cold And lorn and tired and sad. Thy lonely look would strike up through the sky: Thine eyes would reach Through all the stars and find me. One short sigh Would move me more than angels' speech. LXVI. BEAUTY OF SOUL Beauty thou hast to thrill the hearts of men: But wilt thou seek for nothing more? Not seek the loveliness that lasteth when Life's loveliness is o'er? Win thou a glory of sweet heart and mind As noble as thy face is sweet: Let me, love-seeking, ever surely find Christ's eyes when thine I meet. LXVII. LOVE UNDREAMED-OF If I love thee with love surpassing and excelling All love that song or strange high history hath for telling, All love-dreams of the past, Then wilt not thou love me with love that never dreamer In noblest moments dreamed,—love softer and supremer? Will thy love-look not seek mine at the last? If I can bring thee love outweighing and exceeding The common love of man, wilt thou not hear its pleading With tenderer than the heart Of women who are crowned with love that lasts no longer Than bloom of summer rose? If thus my soul be stronger Than souls of most, wilt thou not do thy part? If I bestow on thee a love that knows no ending, Wilt thou be ever mine, in sweetest purest blending Of spirit and of mind? —That so our souls may teach the world before we quit it The deathless lore of love, and write, if fate permit it, Our story in the heart-depths of mankind. I long to give thee, love, now that the world is aging, The love that all its growth and life have been presaging: The love that Dante knew. Then give thou unto me a heart divinely moulded; Sweeter than ever yet the touch of love unfolded; New to my gaze, and in the world's sight new. LXVIII. “THE DIVINE IN THEE” I When thou dost watch me with those clear brown eyes I have the strangest sense That some immortal spirit from the skies Watches, with gaze intense. II Thou art not woman, but a spirit high Clothed, here, in woman's form. I shall not understand thee till I die— And yet thy lips are warm!— III Thou hast the lips of woman, and her brow, And thy superb black hair Maddened me at the first, and maddens now: And yet thou hast an air IV Of subtle spirithood that more than all Allures and prisoneth me. I love the woman:—at the feet I fall Of the divine in thee. AN EPITAPH To beauty's sovereign grace I would have given, had I the power, The wide world's every flower, Each star from God's cloud-girdled dwelling-place. Now, though the meads in bloom Beseech me, with most lavish hands Fast scattering flowers, and all the seas and lands Bring gifts, I can but place them at a tomb. 1892.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol VI: THE PAGEANT OF LIFE TWO CHRISTMAS SONGS I. SONG OF THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM Lo! this night the Lord descending Comes on earth to dwell. Evil's bitter reign is ending, And the power of hell. Neither Greek nor Roman poet, Great-souled though they be, Read God's secret.—Who shall know it? Darkness, or the sea? Greek and Roman, full of learning, Full of strength and might, Sought for God, their strong hearts yearning Godward in the night. Wise men worshipped God for ages; Builded temples grand: Graved their souls on deathless pages; Wrought in many a land. All these sought for God, and found him, In a measure,—each: Sought for God, and loved, and crowned him; Secrets all could teach. But to-night the love immortal Through the gate of time Passes: makes life's fleshly portal Evermore sublime. Woman now is pure for ever, No more man's sad slave. Let man's heart disdain her never Whom God bends to save! Through her sweet lips cometh sorrow Sometimes—let that be! When the bright dawn breaks to-morrow Over land and sea; When we weary stars are turning Homeward to our rest; When the golden sun is burning On the mountain's crest; Light yet nobler this shall presage: For to-morrow morn Through the world shall thrill the message “Jesus Christ is born!” II. SONG OF WOMEN-SPIRITS God at last has heard our crying. Through the ages past We have sought him, groaning, sighing: He has heard at last. Man has mocked us through the ages, Goaded to despair. Poets, thinkers, soldiers, sages, All have called us fair. All have praised our lips and tresses, Golden locks or black: All have sought our love-caresses: All have held us back. All have checked our souls' aspiring: All have dreaded this. This has tired men, never tiring Of the lips they kiss. All have dreaded lest the morning Which should find us free Would be wild with note of warning Rung by land and sea. Not one noble soul has trusted; Roman, Jew, or Greek. Many and many a sword had rusted, Had they let us speak! Many and many a fierce old quarrel Had been lulled to rest! Ours the myrtle, man's the laurel, Man's the battle-crest. Half the spears that maddening hurtle Through the loud rent air Still had rested, had our myrtle Seemed to man's heart fair! Had man listened to our pleading, To our agelong cry, Battle-fields where he lay bleeding, Waiting there to die, Had been fields of corn and clover, Full of peace supreme: Had but man, our agelong lover, Listened to our dream! For our dream is sweet and holy, Full of peace and grace. Slowly, slowly,—slowly, slowly,— We shall win our place. We shall win man's adoration In a nobler sphere, Rule through him some future nation: For our Prince is here. God, in sending Christ, is sending Woman victory. God at last is mixing, blending, Strength and purity. Not their old song-god Apollo, Bright of face and limb, Is the god for us to follow: Nay! we need not him. Songs are sweet, and singers sweeter: Full of charm was each Old-world bard, and old-world metre, Yet they fail to reach Woman's soul as Christ's deep phrases Reach her heart and ear. Every word of his amazes: Rings out pure and clear. Woman loves at last—who waited Through the ages long, Weary, saddened, worn, ill-mated, Void of heart for song. God, who gave the generations Of the past most dim Unto man, gives future nations Not, oh not, to him! Woman's is the future season. Christ's and woman's day Dawns at last: the end of treason, Swords and spears that slay. Lord, we thank thee that thou hearest Woman's piteous prayer. Christ's chief word, his message clearest, Sweetest and most fair, Is the news that woman never Now need dread man's scorn. Woman now is safe for ever: Jesus Christ is born! MARY MAGDALENE I fall, O Lord, before thy feet, For thou hast taught me things most sweet, Most pure, most grand. Behold! I longed to conquer thee; But am content—if this may be— To kiss thine hand. I dreamed of love, and passion wild, But now, O Lord, am reconciled To loveless hours. Thou art so vast in purity! I dreamed of sin; but, thanks to thee, I dream of flowers. Thou art my God: for thou hast taught Truths reaching far beyond man's thought, Deep truths and grave. While other men defile, deflower, Thou usest thine immortal power To lift and save. As man had made me, lo! I came, A woman full of sin and shame And woe and care; With but one sweet thing left to show— The endless glory and the glow Of my gold hair. This, therefore, Lord, I give to thee: The one sweet pure thing left in me, Golden, divine. These locks that once were wanton gold Around thy sacred feet I fold For loving sign. As man had made me, unto thee I came: paths of iniquity My feet had trod. Shameless I was, and lost alas! As thou hast made me, I can pass Straight up to God. THE CHILD Before the child the world expands, And dreams of green or sunny lands Float in upon his soul from space. Each child upon the planet born Brings back that planet's early morn In the sweet sunrise of his face. The world for each is recreate, And each may meet and conquer Fate, And mould his life to woe or weal. For each the sea again is blue: For each the mountain-summits new; For each the morning bugles peal. For each God sheds his glory again On hill and dell and lake and plain: To each he brings his flowers anew. He paints for each the lily white, And hangs with lamps the dome of night, And paints the sky's great ceiling blue. Aye, through the heart of every child Flows somewhat of the rapture wild Which Adam felt, when first aware At nightfall of the starry deep From which the Lord God watched the sleep Of flowers that bloomed in Eden's air. In every child the race resumes Its youth. Among the garden blooms The young child wanders forth. It sees With sinless eyes the snowdrop white; The cornfield's blaze of golden light; The round-head red anemones. All is so new, all is so sweet. The cold is glad, and glad the heat: The wintry ice brings pleasant dreams. What if the winds of winter roar? Down to the pond the skaters pour: They skate, till out the pale moon gleams. Nature has lessons for the man: With other eyes he learns to scan The mountains, and the heights of space. But never colour gleams so fair As sunset hues in soft June air Upon an upturned boyish face. From out the air, within the sea, The radiant sense of joys to be Speaks to the boy's heart, or the child's. The red-eyed roach, the banded perch: The white trunk of the silver birch: The purple heather of the wilds: The spotted trout, that flashes down Along the ripples golden-brown Of the fern-bordered mountain-stream: The woods, alive with cawing rooks: The deep-blue weeded river-nooks Where lie the barbel and the bream: The butterflies, white, yellow, blue, That haunt the woods, or flutter through The clover-fields beside the sea: The beetles flashing one by one Across the gravel in the sun: The azure sky's infinity: All gather depth of meaning strange From the boy's heart.—All shift and change Their meaning with the growing years. The whole of Nature seems to wait On mankind; changes with his state, And shares his hopes and shares his fears. From out the air a message speaks That flushes through the boy's bright cheeks; The gates of wonder never close. God whispers through the nights of June Of something lovelier than the moon, And something sweeter than the rose. THE YOUTH Life thrills me through with all its mighty power: Lord of my darling's heart, I rule the whole. I reach the golden heart of every flower; I apprehend the starry night's deep soul. Love touches all things into sweeter bloom, Transfigures common things, till heavenly light Gleams from the emerald moss on every tomb And from the smallest blossom pure and white. I love. And therefore heaven and God are true: Christ's resurrection was no woman's dream. Because I love, the sky is ever blue: Because I love, the stars shall alway gleam. Because I love, I understand the love That led God's heart to suffer for the race. God died for all, his love for all to prove, As I would die for one belovéd face. If I thus love, can God love less than I? The Ruler of the spheres love less than man? The God whose breath pervades eternity, Can time-born Satan intercept his plan? Nay! all shall end in joy. All troubles pass. Did not I just now kiss my darling's hand? Chirp, merrier cricket, from the tall green grass! Break, bluer seas, upon a whiter land! Sing, happier birds, from leaves more soft and dense! O goldfinch, chanting from yon apple-tree, God's love which made the heaven a nest immense For all the stars, made thy small nest for thee! For thee and for thy love he made the small Sweet nest of moss and straw and twigs that holds Your four eggs safe, as heaven's nest holdeth all The gold stars safe within its cloudy folds. And for my love and me he made the earth, And all its azure skies, and all its flowers. “Love on,” he said: “Rejoice with tenderest mirth, And seek the fields while I hold back the showers. “I set upon the hedge the scented may That thou mightst pluck it. And I made some white Some red: the red may for your wedding-day, The white pure blossom for your wedding-night. “I made laburnum, yellow, starry, fair, That ye might gather this and be content; Not craving for star-blossoms of the air, But gathering here the golden bloom I sent. “And I made lilac—purple flowers and white: The silvery bloom for her, the deep for thee. And I sent breakers dark and breakers bright To be your coursers over the wide sea. “All things in double forms I made for you: The chestnut-blossoms red, the blossoms pale; The crocus sunlike in its fiery hue, The crocus white as thy love's wedding-veil. “I made the golden sun to light your day: I made the silver moon's less garish light. I gave the nightingale his amorous lay, And bade him chant it on your bridal night. “When the first star lay, resting in my hand, Poised, ere I hurled it forth upon the deep, In my far-seeing thought your love I planned And chose star-warders for your nuptial sleep. “Before the first flower blossomed, I ordained Within my soul the blossoms she should wear. Ere time began, within my thought I stained Deep-red the poppies for her deep-black hair. “And, as time onward sped, through rose on rose I poured the sweetness and the fragrant bliss Which, quite perfected now, her lips disclose, And culled from flowers the sweetness of her kiss.” So God said, having us in his regard, Us two, and us alone, my love and me; As if the whole sublime heaven, golden-starred, Were made to light one inlet of the sea. As if the sun were for a single flower Created,—for one blue-bell in a lane: As if creation's every previous hour Were preparation for our final reign. So ever will we reign, my love and I: The one thing deathless is a love like ours. It gathers depth from the unmeasured sky: It gathers sweetness from the whole world's flowers. My love is mine for ever. I am hers. Nought charms me save the royalty in her look. At her least touch my being thrills and stirs To-day, as at her first long glance it shook. No love that changes is the love supreme: No love that falters is the love divine. Death would not wake me from my passionate dream: No love that tires of love is love like mine. For sooner could God's hand displace the sun, Or hush the drum-roll of the stormy sea, Or, having made stars countless, leave not one, Than quench the unending fire of love in me. THE POET O artist dreaming thus thy life away, There is a higher life than thou canst guess. Art thou a poet? sweet love answers, “nay.” Was Christ a poet? woman answers, “yes.” The highest poethood is ever this: To love as Christ loved, and to save the race. Not to spend wild years, seeking kiss on kiss, But to draw forth the soul in woman's face. To aid the weary, and to lift the low: To show God's pity in the human sphere: Besought by sorrow, never to say “no”: To lend the helpless heart a ready ear: To honour woman, and, if woman slip, To stand by ready, with strong outstretched hand, As God sends starlight to the struggling ship, Or the staunch life-boat pulling from the land: This is true poethood.—Aye, not to love The rose the less, but to love virtue more: Not to love earth less in that, far above, The poet sees the stars that sail or soar. Hast thou God's vision? art thou part of him? Can thine eye, steady, mocking at fatigue, Traverse vast spaces where man's eye grows dim, Pursuing phantom star-ships, league on league? Canst thou through throbbing heart and thrilling nerve Feel God's life tingle? canst thou, looking up, Discern God's sculpture in the rainbow curve, Or, glancing downward, in the tulip's cup? Is woman unto thee past measure more Than unto fools and grovellers of the race? God's woman-nature sent us to adore? One moment's glimpse of the eternal face? Canst thou, beholding her, behold God's sense Of form in every curve of neck and limb? God's deep love, insupportably intense, In the eyes that follow man and worship him? Canst thou see what no common eye can see, And, penetrating far past space and time, Be clothed upon with God's eternity— And, as he made the ebon night sublime With countless stars, make generations bright With songs that breathe through ages yet to be The passionate fragrance of one summer night, The scent of sea-weed on a mortal sea? Then, being more than man in thought and frame, Be more than man in noble act as well; Be poet in thy deeds, not only in name; Flash down song's sunshine to the depths of hell. With all who love and struggle take thy part; The gift most holy of all gifts is thine: Pain never a weak soul, hurt no human heart By one unworthy thought or heartless line. CREATION “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.” Genesis i. 31. God made the earth exceeding good. He clothed the hill, or clothed the wood, In verdurous raiment fresh and fair. He filled the earth with living things: With flashing of innumerous wings He filled the sunlit heights of air. He filled the hollow sea with life. Strange sea-flowers in the far depths thrive, And wondrous fishes, scarlet-scaled, Dart like small flying suns along; And where the eager tides wax strong Rushes the salmon, silver-mailed. God made the day, and made the night. He made the sun's engrossing light To brighten all the daylight hours: Then, lest the sun turn tyrant, made The night to give soft rest and shade To man, and solace to the flowers. He made the stars that shine above The earth, and speak to man of love, And lead love's footsteps with their light: The sweet and passionate stars that say, “If man is sovereign of the day, Woman is priestess of the night!” He made the dawning sense of love That seems a glory from above, A rapture sent from very far. Upon the lips of man he set These words “I love you,” and he let Those words be woman's guiding-star. Upon the woman's lips he placed A sweetness pure, a sweetness chaste, A royal beauty, and a bloom That never flower will quite attain. He said to woman, “Love and reign. For love there is not any tomb.” One kingly right he gave to man; His right it is since time began; The right of passionate address. “I die of love. Wilt thou not save?” And then the Lord to woman gave The right to smile, and answer “Yes.” And then God gave the lips the right To meet, and sent the dark-winged night Angelic, to bring sleep and rest. He bade the deepening twilight close The secret whiteness of the rose, But ope the flower of woman's breast. THE YOUNG GENIUS I. God recreates the earth and air, And makes the vast blue waters fair, And makes the earth's wide meadows green For every genius therein born; For each regards the past with scorn As if it had not been! Each genius, by his birthright grand, Inherits sea and sky and land; For each God clothes all stars anew In fiery splendour.—Shakespeare's dead! But still the sun is golden-red, And still the waves are blue. The first white snowdrop is as fair To genius, when Spring's soft hands bear Her gentle early gifts to him, As if no snowdrops ever leaped Before above the mould, or peeped Into the crocus-rim. And unto genius most of all Is woman ever new. Eve's fall Made her perhaps less strangely fair To Adam. But though Adam grieve, His Eden holds an unfallen Eve And genius finds her there. Yes; ever to the genius-eyes The tender light of Paradise Beams forth from woman's perfect look. Her lips are fragrant as the flowers That in life's morning's golden hours From Eden's banks she took. God, that he might forget her fall, Created genius most of all, And set within the genius-brain The power of worship passionate; That woman he might reinstate, And honour her again. That God might constantly repeat His own deep sense of wonder sweet, The passionate awe, the joy sublime, Which first he felt creating Eve, He made the genius-heart achieve The same work through all time. Subordinate to his alone He set the kingly genius-throne, And bade his poet-souls receive His thought anew; that every age Might so repeat the Eden stage, And shape its perfect Eve. II. So genius finding all things new, Must recreate its kingdom too And pay no homage to the past. “Lo! God is in these hills and streams. With miracle the present teems: With wonder sweet and vast.” But no man listens to his tale. He seeks to draw aside the veil That hides the solemn stars of space: He seeks to represent to man God undivulged since time began Save through some human face: But no, mankind will nought of him. His own friends say, “How strange a whim! We knew that poets lived of old; We knew that prophets spake of God; But this man do the same? How odd! His heart is overbold. “Poets have lived. The whole world sang When Shelley's wondrous live harp rang, And thrilled the height and thrilled the deep. All nature in her joyous hours For Keats' brow wove her fairest flowers; Aye, lulled him soon to sleep. “The whole of history spake indeed Through Hugo. What soul can succeed In adding aught to things once said? Yea, God himself who made the sun Was satisfied—he made but one. Darkness! if that were dead.” Darkness? O fools, the solemn night Brims over with perennial light; A hundred million suns in space Flame round about the Eternal's throne, And each sun guards and herds its own Planets that wheel and race. But ever genius must renew The same old struggle, wrestle through The same old thickets of dismay; Be dubbed Beelzebub, when most Inspired by that strong Holy Ghost Who lives and speaks to-day. Still must the son of God, the bard, Find life's long battle bitter hard, Meet envy, hatred, wrath and scorn; Still will he, struggling hard to lift Mankind, receive mankind's one gift— Christ's battered crown of thorn. III. Moreover, genius never feels Save in extremes.—Its whole brain reels With wild delight, or rocks with woe. From one extreme it plunges on To other heights and depths that none Save genius' self may know. It worships God, it worships long Within his house with prayer and song; Then lo! his Temple's gold gates close: The poet sallies forth, and finds Lovely upon the summer winds The soft breath of the rose. Unstable? Yes, but even so The thoughts and songs of genius grow And eddy along their destined course. All is extreme. All is superb And strong and reinless; without curb; Unfettered, full of force. God speaks not only in one hour, Not through the beauty of one flower, But through the flowers of endless time. When genius and the Lord collogue, They speak not in the vulgar brogue But in a tongue sublime. The commonplace well-balanced fool Who speaks by rote and lives by rule, What shall he of God's glories see? What shall he know of woman's heart? Or of the mountain-range of Art Or of Art's ecstasy? But genius, wild, extreme, perverse, With lips that bless, or lips that curse, Brow-bound with thorns, with sorrow shod, However man's heart may despise The deep love-yearning in its eyes, Is strangely close to God. GROWING OLD There is a holy joy in growing old, If but the soul grows as the strength declines. Life's winter need not freeze with flowerless cold, Though spring's brave golden sun no longer shines. Though passion's blossoms wither, are the stars Not nearer, as our ripe souls yearn through space? Heaven's far-lit windows gleam devoid of bars, Wide open, on the upturned aging face. We are more near to death, but nearer too To countless loved ones who have gone before; Who watched death's grey waves quickening into blue, As sunlight reached them from the further shore. This brings content,—aye, rapture. Perfect peace Of spirit should be the sweet lot of the old: A large trust that God's bounty cannot cease; Hope that life's fairy-tale is not half told! Hope that the Power which made so passing fair Our earthly springs, made green leaves interlace, Can bring with grand result its force to bear On higher spheres—that hold some higher race? Strive so to live that, when you come to die, Sweet thoughts may follow you from all your land: Thoughts that shall shine like stars within the sky Of death, and make the sombre prospect grand. Thoughts both of man and woman.—Let men say, “He changed our souls to fire, to slay all wrong:” Let women think, “He lifted sorrow away, And made us stronger, being himself so strong. “No woman was the worse—the better, all, For loving help and helpful love he gave. He lured no trusting weak one to her fall. Our blessing reaches him beyond the grave.” On one side clamour of our winds and waves; Babble of voices; golden stars that burn; Birds singing in the elm-trees over graves; White tombstones couched amid the clustering fern: White tombstones—yes! But bright life over all: Above the graveyard skies of ceaseless blue: The starlit heavens for canopy and pall: This on one side. But, dead man, what of you? Can your eyes now behold the summer skies? Can your ears hear the summer birds that sing? —Or is the silence where the dead man lies Perhaps the noblest gift that death can bring? For through that supreme silence that no voice Of mortal penetrates, that starless gloom, God's voice may sound; and it may say, “Rejoice,” In accents thrilling through the fast-closed tomb. “Rejoice: thy work is over. Take thy rest. Of sweet peace drink thy fill. Thy strife is o'er. Pillow thine head on the Eternal's breast. Suffered thou hast? Thou shalt not suffer more. “Are there no stars to light thee? Is it gloom Within the grave? I am thy star, thy light. Though death to every sun and star spake doom, The Lord thy God is stronger than the night. “There is no death, if thou art part of me: No night, for I will be thy midday sun; Pour at thy feet a new-created sea; Before thy gaze make silver rivers run. “The world with all its graves and flowers is mine, And thou hast helped that world along life's way: Fear not, though never glow-worm star should shine; The God who made the stars is more than they.” This I regret—this grieves me, growing old— That, though maybe to heavenly fields I pass I never more shall see the cowslip's gold Sprinkle with glittering gems the green spring grass. I never more shall see—whatever waits Of glory and beauty far beyond the tomb— One earthly sunset open crimson gates, Or one wild crimson clover-field in bloom. Moreover all the valiant deeds to come, Great deeds in which my nation will take part— Shall I behold them from some heavenly home, And will they thrill to fire my heavenly heart? The next great war! When Europe shakes again Beneath opposing millions' battle-tread, When Belgium is once more a battle-plain Or the Swiss mountain-meadows reek with dead, Shall I behold? Shall I be closed off quite From all the stirring clash of things to come? When England next arises in her might, Shall I be barred behind the eyeless tomb? When England breasts, upon some future sea, The giant-armoured fleets men now prepare, Will not her trumpet-voice reach even me? Shall I not long, long madly, to be there? When France and Russia force us, it may be, To test our iron-plated darkling horde Of monstrous vessels, churning up the sea With Titan screw or fierce torpedo-sword; Or when the red line, where far Indus flows, Wrestles for India, on one mighty day, Shall I be heedless how the battle goes,— Silent for ever, wholly past away? My eyes will soon be dimmed.—God will behold All stars for ever, and all suns of space. In fiery rank on rank of glittering gold Their hosts will charge and wheel before his face. I shall not see the flowers: but God will see The flowers of endless springs, through endless days. He'll share the rose's own eternity, And wander through the sealed years' hidden ways. I shall not hear the thunder, or the roar Of ocean.—God will hear the thunders roll, And hear the huge waves plunge upon the shore, And guide the flashing lightnings to their goal. New moons will silver placid wastes of sea; New suns will blaze above the golden sand: New lovers—yes, to all eternity— Will gaze in eyes that love and understand. God will behold.—The glorious dark-brown hair Of maid on maid he will caress and stroke. Through spring on spring his palette will prepare New soft green colours for each budding oak. He will array each kingfisher in blue, And robe the goldfinch—touch its cheek with red: Crumble to dust the stars,—then make all new; I shall be gone, but God will not be dead. O living mighty Lord, into thine hand I give myself, and all I may not see: The green robes of the cliffs, the corn-clad land, The thyme-tufts shaken by the summer bee. Thou ever hast the past before thy gaze: The present and the future are but one To thee. We see all life through clouds and haze; But thine eyes front and blench not at the sun. YOUNG GIRL'S SONG I. Golden dawn is breaking Over land and sea: All the birds are waking: Does my love love me? See, the morning's sweetness At the window-pane! Summer's full completeness Has returned again. In my heart all flowers Seem to blossom now: Bloom of woodbine-bowers; Buds of apple-bough. Hardly can I fancy What is most in bloom,— Jasmine, purple pansy, Rosebuds in the room, Or my own young gladness Bidding sorrow flee, Sorrow, pain, and sadness, Over leagues of sea; Bidding sorrow leave me For the good God says Nothing ought to grieve me In these summer days; Nothing ought to sadden Mine, a young girl's heart; All hours ought to gladden; All pangs to depart. There are wars and troubles In the world, I know —There are white foam-bubbles On the stream below: Fierce and strong and rapid Does its current gleam, While the poplars vapid Watch it in a dream. But I see the blossoms At the water's edge: Lilies' golden bosoms, Feathery bloom of sedge. When the sun amazes All the banks so green, Then I count the daisies, Tipped with crimson sheen. Gold-crest, wren, and linnet, These I watch and love: God sends every minute Music from above. In the morning early, Singing in the sky 'Mid the cloud-wreaths pearly, Chants the lark on high. When the warm sun blanches Midday with its heat, In the beech-tree branches Sings the throstle sweet. Then the blackbird whistles From the holly-tree: Tom-tits from the thistles Chirp, and call to me. On the river-border Red-breasts cut a dash; Stout knights of the Order Of the crimson sash. Then the singer rarer, While the moonrays gleam, Makes the world a sharer In her deathless dream. So God sends me singers; Till night's darkness deep On the river lingers, And the bird-choirs sleep. II. Yet far sweeter fancies Fill my heart at times; Sweeter than romances Of far Eastern climes. Yes, I have a lover! Does my love love me? He's a sailor-rover, Married to the sea. Yet I know he's faithful: Though the waters blue (Fierce perhaps, and wrathful?) Bore him from my view. Wheresoe'er he wanders, Nigh what alien shores, Sure am I he ponders On me, and adores. Hourly from his pocket Sure am I he takes That small golden locket, Clasped by silver snakes. Sure am I he gazes, Wheresoe'er he be, On three small dried daisies In it...and on me! III. God has given me gladness: I must pass it on. I must banish sadness, Not be glad alone. See the sun, how proudly He bends down to bless: Calls the daisy loudly To his strong caress! All on God dependent Pass his blessings on. Is the sun resplendent? He creates the moon. I must give my pleasure To the world again. Glad beyond all measure, I must lessen pain. Hear me, Father, hear me! Thou hast bent to bless: Sent the sun to cheer me; Sent the air's caress; Sent the rosebuds trailing At the window-pane; Sent these petals hailing, Gold laburnum-rain; Sent the fragrant breathing Of the fields in May, Blossoms interwreathing, Lilac-branch and spray; Sent the dark-green laurel, Sentry at the gate; Birds that chirp and quarrel Lest they be too late, To my window flying For the bread-crumbs there— Titmouse pert and prying, Chaffinch debonair! —Let me give the gladness Thou hast given to me To some soul in sadness,— Change to ecstasy Sorrow of some laden Weary heart and brain: I, a laughing maiden, I would solace pain. With my touch caressing I would soothe the sad; Fill man's life with blessing, Make the whole world glad! THE OLD MAID She gave her life to love. She never knew What other women give their all to gain. Others were fickle. She was passing true. She gave pure love, and faith without a stain. She never married. Suitors came and went: The dark eyes flashed their love on one alone. Her life was passed in quiet and content. The old love reigned. No rival shared the throne. Think you her life was wasted? Vale and hill Blossomed in summer, and white winter came: The blue ice stiffened on the silenced rill: All times and seasons found her still the same. Her heart was full of sweetness till the end. What once she gave, she never took away. Through all her youth she loved one faithful friend: She loves him now her hair is growing grey. THE BLIND POET Within a humble London room A poet lived and wrought: He saw the sweet spring-blossoms bloom, But only in his thought. His eyes were darkened. But his soul Had power to see the skies: Of Nature's lore he read the whole With his heart's loving eyes. A thousand spirits walk the earth, Yet have no power to see: They miss its sorrow, miss its mirth, Its beauty. Not so he! For him the sun was full of light, And blue the clear sea-wave; The wind-tost woods returned delight For music that he gave. The rosebud in his song was red; The sun-kissed hills were green The daisy to his door was led, As proud as any queen! For to each flower he gave a life Beyond the life of time, And by his music made the strife Of wrestling storms sublime. Aye, all hearts loved him. But the dead, They loved him best, it seems. They hovered round about his bed, And drew him through his dreams. They drew his spirit towards the land Where all who love shall see. They took the blind man by the hand: He followed fearlessly. They led him from this land of ours, And promised him a boon: “Thine eyes shall feast on heavenly flowers, On heavenly sun and moon; “Thou shalt see heavenly stars,” they said; “Thou shalt breathe heavenly air; Thou shalt know rapture 'mid the dead, Who, living, knewest despair: “Follow.”—He listened to the voice, And left us here in gloom. Yet has he made the wiser choice: He has left his darkened room. He saw on earth pale ghosts of stars; But that dim life is done: Death bursts his darkness' prison-bars; To-day he sees the sun. FOUR BALLADS I. A SOUTHERN VENGEANCE Under the bright room where they lay, Deep in the stonework gaunt and grey, I will build a dungeon grim. She and her lover (I stabbed him dead, And his blood-drops splashed her breast with red) Shall rest in the darkness dim. Under the bright room where they lay They shall wait in the dark till the Judgment Day Flames out upon her and him. (How it goes ring, ringing, through my brain, That foolish light old swift refrain She was singing when we met in Spain; “I love you, I love you—” again and again!) My hands may tremble. I will not shrink. Clink goes the trowel. Clink! clink! clink! Clink! clink! clink! Under the bright room where they slept Till up from the sea the gold sun leapt, In sunless darkness deep They shall rest till the solemn trump of doom Shakes the walls of their wedding-room And summons their souls from sleep. White by his couch her form shall stand, And her lips shall struggle to kiss his hand And her eyes shall strive to weep. (How I remember the tinkling stream And the night that passed in a maddening dream— The room where we slept, and the pale moonbeam, And her eyes with their wonderful passionate gleam!) Death's cup is ready. Her lips shall drink. Clink goes the trowel. Clink! clink! clink! Clink! clink! clink! Under the bright room where they lay I will build a dungeon, and no day Shall ever enter there. I will take her, stately and lovely—so That the heart of a god might madden and glow With love of her thick black hair: Then, brick by brick and stone by stone, I will build her up in the vault, alone With the man her eyes found fair. (Darling—“the gnat has stung the white Of your beautiful arm,” so I said in the night: “Lay your arm in the moon's soft light; Let me suck the poison out—my right!”) I will not pause to remember or think. Clink goes the trowel. Clink! clink! clink! Clink! clink! clink! Under the bright room where they lay, The room that looks on the sunny bay, I have built a sunless tomb. There my darling and he shall be wed. I stabbed him—curse him! He lies there dead, Stark on a couch in the gloom. Down in the dark she shall live with him: They shall kiss in the dark, till their eyes grow dim And their lustful limbs consume. (I loved her so. Oh, my raven hair And the beautiful throat I found so fair! I loved you—a girl with shoulders bare— And I love you still. That means despair.) I work. I sever the past's last link. Clink goes the trowel. Clink! clink! clink! Clink! clink! clink! Under their bright room, far below, Where the grass spreads rank and the mosses grow, She shall stand and feast her eyes On the corpse of the man she loved so well, Till she starves to a corpse in the vault's dim hell And, grasping her dead man, dies. Outside, the butterflies white will race, And the girls will pass to the market-place, Singing under the sunny skies. Step into the tomb, my lady fair. Your death-cold lover is waiting there With a brave true kiss for the thick black hair, Such a brave true kiss for the thick black hair. (Clink! clink! clink!) II. “YO HO! YO HO!” Over the blue waves leaping The eager vessel flies; It laughs at the green isles sleeping, And it smiles at the sunny skies. But the pilot's song is of sadness, For he knows in the midnight deep That the white waves rise to madness, And he knows where the drowned men sleep. But “Yo ho! Yo ho!” sing the men below; “We care not a fig what wind may blow, Yo ho! Yo ho!” The ships that are passing hail them, Loud echoes the sailor's shout; Did ever their bold hearts fail them, While the flagons of wine held out? The pilot dreams of the haven, And the woman he loves ashore: Black hair like the wing of the raven— Will he never see it more? But “Yo ho! Yo ho!” sing the men below; “Give us wine, and the ship to the bottom may go! Yo ho! Yo ho!” The pilot thinks of his darling By her grey-haired mother's side— (“Yelp!” go the hoarse waves snarling) His beauty, his heart's own pride. He thinks of the Church so quiet On the side of the old green hill (The wind is beginning to riot, And the ropes are never still). “Yo ho! Yo ho!” sing the men below; “Shall the wind's chirp frighten us. No, no, no. Yo ho! Yo ho!” The evening saddens and darkens, And the roaring surges swell; The pilot sighs, as he hearkens To the sound he knows so well. Yet in spite of the sea-waves' warning There is hope in his song to-night, For England's cliffs in the morning May flash on the seamen's sight. But “Yo ho! Yo ho!” sing the men below; “When the bottle goes round, the fun will grow, Yo ho! Yo ho!” But the ship from her course is swerving; On the sharp reefs howl the waves With ponderous white crests curving, And the green gulfs yawn like graves. And the song of the pilot changes, As he stands at the helm—still there— While his eye o'er the black night ranges, To the wild song of despair. Still “Yo ho! Yo ho!” sang the men below, For death can be drowned in the bowl, we know, “Yo ho! Yo ho!” III. THE BLACK FLAG Would you know the life that is fair and free? Climb the downs, and gaze o'er the open sea. See you the schooner at anchor there, And the black flag, strange in the sunny air? That is the bark of the pirate king, And this is the song the pirates sing: “We scuttle a galleon every day, And the blue sea washes the stains away; Can drowned men rise from sleep?” Yesterday morning, rank on rank They stood, while a doomed man walked the plank. Soon only a bubble marked the spot, But the light-heart pirates heeded not; They danced on deck, and they laughed and sang Till the ship's old timbers echoed and rang— “Though the deck run red with the signs of the fray, The sea can wash all stains away, And we are the lords of the deep. “Men think they love, on the dull stale shore; We love, where the billows plunge and roar. We take our pick of the captured girls; Some like black tresses, some love gold curls; We take our pick, and the rest we drown, And they tumble after their sweethearts down To the blue clear depths of the Indian bay, And the tide will carry them right away While their sisters wail and weep. “Then under the trees, if ever we land, Close to the waves on the golden sand, We spread for ourselves a royal feast; The wine shall flow for a night at least! And there by the firelight on the shore Our jolly old chorus loud we roar, ‘Will the waves betray us? Nay, nay, nay! For the sea can wash all stains away, Though the prisoners die in a heap.’ “One of the captured girls we crown— The one with the eyes of lovely brown. She sorrowed at first. She is reconciled, And there isn't a pirate heart more wild. Bride she shall be of the pirate king, And her bright red laughing lips shall sing ‘When the sea-king speaks the waves obey, And they wash the blood of his foes away, And their bones the green depths keep.’” That is the life that is fair and free— So the pirates think—on the fair blue sea. But if ever a king's ship spies them out They must sharpen their cutlas-blades, no doubt, For the king's stout sailors will harry them then And their one last chance is to die like men, Die in a frenzy, fierce and gay, And the sea will wash their blood away, And the waves will over them leap. IV. THE FAIRY BELLS Of old at night, when the woods were bright And the air was warm with the warmth of June, The bells of the fairies tinkled light And their eyes flashed under the summer moon. Yes, then you might hear, when the moon shone clear Through the woods, or over the purple fells, Sometimes distant, and sometimes near, The sound of the beautiful fairy bells, The beautiful fairy bells. Alas! men's hearts waxed selfish and hard, And they only cared for gold and gain; The ears of the fairies grew quite jarred By the puff, puff, puff of the rattling train. To deep dark forests the fairies fled, And we all are sorry—though no one tells— That the innocent sweet old days are dead When we all could hear the fairy bells, The beautiful fairy bells. But still when lovers are fond and true, If they listen within the woods of June When the stars shine through deep skies of blue And the white clouds kiss the shy-faced moon, They may hear, they may hear, soft, sweet and clear, A sound that rises, a sound that swells, Sometimes distant and sometimes near— The sound of the beautiful fairy bells, The beautiful fairy bells. A POET'S GETHSEMANE Part I. THE AGONY OF YOUTH I. IN LONDON. “I love you not,” her letter says: “You even insult me by the thought.” Insult her!...I who had given my days, My heart, my life, to please in aught The woman who now writes to me With a girl's perfect cruelty. “My love is given to him whose wife In some short weeks I am to be.” Then why, in God's name, did she strive To win my pure first love from me? She found, no doubt, a light fierce joy, Experimenting on a boy. A boy's heart! Yes, she thought, no doubt, That I could take the thing in jest: Could serve her, follow her about, And give some love,—yet not my best. My love was sweet in summer-time. It lasts till winter—that's a crime! It pleased her in those summer hours: The passionate worship that I brought Was new to her.—We gathered flowers; Her swift eyes searched for mine, unsought. Her hand pressed mine. Its velvet touch Thrilled through my palm,—and that was much. It seems half lovely, as I look With burning wild gaze back to-day —The meadow-sweet beside the brook; The broad sea-spaces, silver-grey; The walks beneath the moon at night; The boats' sails, brown or snowy white; The stream that gurgled past the mill; The arbour at the garden's end; Our quarrel on the corn-clad hill: Her laughing anger with her friend; Her knife—with which (with skill sublime!) I carved our names, to mock at time; The very robin, perching near In the wide low-branched apple tree And craving largess without fear Of bread-crumbs as we sat at tea Within the bower beside the stream; These things flash on me as I dream! And yet I hold her letter—Yes, It proves the former things were lies; Her soft hand's touch,—like a caress! Her glance,—like God's glance from the skies! My castle of bright dreams must fall: She never cared for me at all. And yet she did care—there's the pang, The viewless horror. That's the spear That rends my heart with iron fang,— The crowning shattering maddening fear That, after all, the woman's heart Is, always, of my own a part. That is the terror. When a girl So leads a youth's wild heart astray God does not let her lightly curl Herself to sleep for many a day Within the bosom, or the bed, Of him she now has chosen to wed. No, God sends anguish. There's the fear: She yet may rise and come to me; Fierce passion yet may win her ear And, murmuring therein constantly, May make her hate the man for whom She now consigns love to its tomb. For, when her eyes met mine, I know There was a something in their gaze Which, though long years may come and go And many an autumn strew the ways With wild leaves shivering at the rain, Will never flash through them again. Never. He cannot draw her eyes To his, as yesterday I drew Their glance, and saw the tear-drops rise, And laughed as through my soul I knew That she who once those far shores trod With me was given to me by God. When once the soul has seen the soul, The man and woman cannot part: Another lover may control The woman's body,—not her heart. Of all things sad, I think that this Sad thing by far the saddest is. And this is ever a poet's fate! To know the woman his indeed, And then to know she knows too late: To know that God's will has decreed That she shall learn what love implies By murdering love before his eyes. A poet by his subtle force Of soul and being can discern The woman's nature still in course Of being created; he can burn With passion for the soul half born— The soul her “husband's” soul will scorn. The poet sees what she can see Hardly at all—her nature true: He feels this linked eternally In sweet communion ever-new To his true nature; feels her wife; Rooted in him: his breath; his life. And then he sees the woman swerve And, knowing not her counterpart, Give touch of body, shock of nerve (Never the shock of heart and heart!) To some man who can only see What's evident externally. This man becomes her “husband”: though The poet feels with sweet divine Strange agony, “Though this be so, In God's sight still the woman's mine. Aye, though he hold her, hold her fast, Her soul will fly to mine at last.” And then the Vision! Who sent that? Was that some lying spirit's design? —As in my lonely room I sat (Her hand that day had thrilled through mine) There came, one night, a sudden sense Superb, engrossing, clear, intense, A sudden sense that she was there, Close by me in that very room; Herself, proud, queenly. While the air Grew fragrant as with summer's bloom, Through this sweet air the woman came And touched my lips with lips of flame. Then, through the long miraculous night I lay awake, yet slept it seemed A slumber broken by delight, And through my soul her strange eyes gleamed. I clasped her in our marriage-bed: “How beautiful you are!” I said. And then her body, wondrous, white, Pure, full of maiden strength and calm, Seemed to transfuse me with its light: Glad mouth to mouth, warm palm to palm, Quite till the crimson dawn of day Wrapt in our marriage-bliss we lay. And night by night the woman came: For some six nights the glory gleamed: For some six nights all heaven aflame, All earth aflower and fervent seemed. Aye, night by night I seemed to rest Triumphant on her very breast. I closed my eyes each night,—and then Unclosed my eyes, and she was there; Ever the same: each night again She seemed to watch me, noble, fair Pure-wifely; and she laid her head Beside mine in my lonely bed. That was the Vision.—I believed The living God had sent it me: With joyous full heart I received Its message of great ecstasy. She was my wife. So God had said, Who sent her angel to my bed. And, now that God had done this thing, Could any hold that God would lie? That he would steal my wife, and fling Deep into hell irrevocably The soul who had believed his word? Could God deny himself? Absurd! Could God now prostitute my bride By placing in another's bed, Warm from the pressure of my side, The form to mine but lately wed? Could God thus rend her limb from limb? Give soul to me—body to him? Nay, never! For my Vision stood Superb and strong, emphatic, clear. If any dream of old held good, If God once spake in Abraham's ear, If he with Moses held discourse, He had spoken to me with no less force. In modern London just as clear The Lord had spoken out to me As where the heights of Sinai sheer Rose in their grim austerity. To me the Lord had spoken who spake To fishers on the Eastern lake. There were not visions two or three, Gods two or three, but only one. God spake to Christ: God spake to me: And what he promised would be done. God lied to me? He lied to all. By this his truth must stand or fall. So, full of faith, I went to her, Believing that the Lord who sent The sacred Vision could not err And that his sovereign justice meant That she should mar her mother's scheme And bring fulfilment to my dream. For, “surely now I see,” I said, “She does not love him. She is mine. Her white ghost slept within my bed: Her ghost-arms round my neck did twine: The woman's self must now fulfil The high God's undisputed will.” She would not see me. But instead She wrote the pencil scrap I hold. I read it,—and my heart fell dead: I, who had been so strong and bold, So full of faith—that this should be The end of all God's pageantry! “Leave me,” she said, “and be a man: Yes, leave me and all thought of me. I do not change: I never can. To him whose wife I am to be My love is given,—aye, all my heart. For ever you and I must part.” This on the Vision's very top! This flung in God's face as reply! My heart came to a sudden stop: I did not reason, or ask why So strange, so mad, an answer came, Befouling her and God with shame. I simply seemed turned quite to stone. I left the house—I know not how— Without a sigh, without a groan: (I wonder at my calmness now)— Crushed utterly; completely slain; Too throughly stricken almost for pain. II. AT OXFORD. SIX WEEKS LATER. Six weeks ago! How long it seems Since through the quiet London square I walked, bereft of hopes and dreams, And felt my whole life leafless, bare, Barren for ever. Now to-day The earth is gladdened. It is May. I walk beside the river's marge; I see the grey old Oxford towers; Watch flashing skiff, and glittering barge, And, on the banks, the same old flowers. Town, river, fields—all are the same: My only sameness is my name. I feel as if I bore within My frame a corpse. With living eyes I see the quick foam-bubbles spin Adown the weir; I see the skies; I see the flowers; I see the oars Sweep by the old thyme-scented shores. And yet I know that I am dead And that the horror of despair Grips all my heart...They must be wed By now—and does he find her fair? And does he twine with tender hands The sweet long loosened brown hair-bands? Was last night—yes?—their wedding night, Or will it be to-night? Will he Win from her lips unknown delight And find her sweet exceedingly? So soft to touch? so good to kiss? And was my darling born for this? And was I born to watch the oars Flash by the thyme-sweet Isis' banks, To pace these green sun-lighted shores, To watch the tall reeds' dark-green ranks, While, underneath the May-stars bright, Such horror may take place to-night? The days pass on. I hate this place. I hate the country green and fair; I hate the bright swift boats that race; I hate the pure sweet-smelling air; I hate the river broad and blue; I hate these trees the sun gleams through. I'll back to London! There, at least I shall feel nearer to the past: The distance will have then decreased Between me and where I saw her last. I shall be happier near the spot Where she so loved, yet loved me not. London! I died in town in March, And I'll revisit town in May. The flower-beds near the Marble Arch, With hyacinths or tulips gay, Are fairer than these country meads Wherethrough the blue old Isis speeds. I shall be near the house wherein I saw her last; saw those strange eyes, In which I fancied love had been,— In which I saw the tear-drops rise. I'll turn once more that old sad page Of life, and make my pilgrimage. III. LONDON. IN JUNE AND JULY. I saw her face again at Lord's. Her eyes met mine. She grew quite pale. Her eyes' expression ill accords With happiness. The same old tale I think it is. The mothers sell Their daughters, and so people hell. I think she loves me.—Oh, her heart Was sweet and grand and full of power! She loved and worshipped all true Art: She should have helped me tend to flower The bud of poesy that she Discerned and nurtured first in me. In this strange age, when all is new, When Thought arises from the tomb, There was such glorious work to do: But she shrinks back into the gloom. What dulls for her Time's golden dawn? The sunset o'er a Rectory lawn! She might have held a poet's heart, Held it for ever. She and I, Wedded in love and love of Art, Married most sympathetically, Might nobly have helped the world along, She by brave thought, and I by song. The chance is over.—Though her eyes Met mine at Lord's the other day, They soon will meet the calm blue skies In the green country, far away From London smoke and London noise, And far from action's rarest joys. High thought will quit her heart and brain; Aye, gradually the thought of me, At first a pang, a passionate pain, Will change to a faint memory. Then the dull prose of daily life Will make her—just a parson's wife. She will read Keble on the lawn, And talk of Keble to his friends: Our hearts will far apart be drawn; We shall be seeking different ends; Her husband-priest will weigh her down, And scatter to the winds her crown. I loved her so! I would have died To help her thought,—to lift it on. Upon the forehead of my bride Thought's fairest circlet should have shone. I loved in early days to see Her young thought's budding potency. Now it is over. Day by day Her thought must grow more dull and hard: Winter will blight the blossoming spray; The Church's keen frost will retard The growth of blossom-thoughts and deeds That would have widened past old creeds. Yes, she is his. His—evermore. Not only body, lovely face, Sweet lips a god's heart might adore, Shoulders a god's arms might embrace, Not only this—the mind as well Is prostituted. That is hell. The mind and body both must go: The head, the heart, the young pure soul: All will be, by a process slow But sure, diverted to a goal Far other than our young hearts dreamed When at our feet the bright waves gleamed. The waves must all lament with me! The flowers and sprays we gathered there; The stars that shone above our sea; The ferns I twisted in her hair; How all must grieve, how all must weep, That her young soul has fallen asleep! Part II. THE AGONY OF MANHOOD I. SUNLIGHT. Thirteen long years have passed away Since through those autumn woods we went: It was a bright September day, And I was full of sweet content; So happy by her side to be— In heaven, if she but looked at me. The leaves were turning golden-red; The swift stream splashed along the dale; In the far distance, blue, outspread, Boundless, with here and there a sail, The sunlit sea gleamed, saying, “To-night Reseek my green cliff's moonlit height.” We were so happy, she and I! There was no place for black despair In all the world! clear was the sky, The autumn flowers were sweet, the air Was crisp and pure. In that green wood It seemed to me God must be good. I know she loved me then. Her eyes Sought mine so constantly,—yet fell, As if with maidenly surprise, As if afraid their tale to tell, When mine searched in their depths to see If yet she was in love with me. Ah! thirteen years. To-day in town My head reels with the strangest sense That that, my first love's long-lost crown, May yet by God's omnipotence Be quite restored, returned to me, In all its pristine purity. I am in love. I feel it now: I feel the sweet sense through each vein. I am in love: I know not how; And yet I am in love again. I am in love. Yes, ten times more Even than I ever loved before. I loved—those thirteen years ago— With tenderest love. My love was slain. I married, and I seemed to know Some slight sweet respite from my pain. I was beloved with passion wild, And I,—I loved the gold-haired child. But still through all my married life The old fierce former dream prevailed, And, though I loved my loving wife, My heart was ceaselessly assailed By memories strong. I loved; and yet I could not stifle mad regret. The old hands drew me, and the eyes Still drew me,—and I seemed to see Ever the pale-blue Northern skies And heard the wild wind's revelry Along the Northern shores, and dreamed That as of old the white moon gleamed. But now to-day I am in love, In love again,—and now I know (For this new fact has served to prove Beyond dispute that this is so) That never, since those early hours, Has my heart loved with all its powers. Strong manhood adds a newer force To love to-day. I love at last Once more with passion; gain of course An added strength from all my past. Past loves, like rivers, with their might Swell the sea-passion of last night. It seemed so strange—the girlish trust Of her who met me, quite alone. The wild Strand, thronged with painted lust, Seemed heavenlike when I heard her tone. She met me, trusted me. Quite pure She was. Her first look made me sure. And then I loved her. That, you see, Was just God's mystery—very sweet. Her simple girlish purity Brought the worn poet to her feet. In a wild world of wrath and crime She seemed half sweet, and half sublime. Then, at the play, I watched her face: It seemed so strange—there, quite alone With this girl full of girlish grace And tenderest beauty, flower half-blown. Alone,—no friend or guardian near; And yet she seemed to have no fear. I think that changed me. That drew out Life's poison from my veins in part. She was a pure girl, not a doubt, With loving eyes and loving heart, And yet she sat there by the side Of one in whom all faith had died. She sat there, knowing nought of me, Yet trusting.—Then my whole heart grew Softer: I loved her purity; I felt it thrill me through and through. I left her at her mother's door; In love with her, for evermore. The days are passing swiftly on; Some happiness returns to me: I feel as if some light had shone From out the deep obscurity. It may be God has watched my pain, And will restore my love again. How if God has led up to this? If from the first he thus designed, And robbed me of my first love's kiss To pay me back in higher kind? I love this girl; and can it be That God may let her love—even me? Even me—sad, care-worn, ill at ease, At war with self, the world, and him; Harassed by wild perplexities; Weary with strife and suffering grim; Can she—this young bright girl—be brought To give my love one passing thought? I am so old and weary. She Is young, fatigueless. Death, it seems, Were far more fitting bride for me Than this young girl, whose dark glance dreams Sweet dreams of spring, and spring's flowers fair, While I dream only of despair. Yet if it could be so? my prayer Would then be answered, and I might (I think I never saw such hair— Coal-black: and then the brown eyes' light!) —I might, perhaps, again believe In God. The sun might shine at eve. I think God lets me love her too. Perhaps God brought me to her side With a distinct great work to do, A true man's work, before I died. It may be so. She's on the stage, So round her all the man-wolves rage. Curse them! I know them. Just because She's unprotected, poor and weak, They'll glance around, and leer, and pause, And think their game is safe, and seek With one accord to steal this pearl. They'll do their best to ruin the girl. My dark-eyed darling! no, please God, They shall not ruin you. I say “No.” Your feet across my path have trod, And you have made my tired heart glow: Would any injure you, of these? Across my body, if you please! I stand, and God stands, in the way. All London seems against you—yes? They say you shall sink. But I say That you shall not sink: nothing less. I'll fight for you for endless time, And make the battle-field sublime. All London on one side, and this The low and bad side? let it be. Men proffering diamonds for your kiss? Well, let them proffer. Trust in me. Bribed managers may swear to wrong: I'll save you,—and crown you with my song. These men are devils. Day by day They struggle to seduce anew Poor foolish girls, their easy prey. They make, themselves a hellish crew, The stage a hell. They can't afford To scorn the offer of a lord. He wants a chorus-girl? My lord May pick and choose. The manager (Tipped by the youngling) will accord His lordship leave without demur To pass behind the scenes, and try Girl-fishing with the golden fly. Money's the question, that is all. Just money—money. Can he pay? He can? How soon the girl will fall! How Satan hates enforced delay! A bouquet—bracelet—supper—kiss— And Miss S. is no longer “Miss.” She has learned the secret; still a child, It may be; ignorant indeed: Yet ruined, lost, betrayed, beguiled, And just to gratify the greed Of managers, and lust of men Who ornament the “Upper Ten.” Not so in your case. I will step Between you and the men who rove Destroying. You a demirep? You sell your beauty, and your love? Never! I swear your soul shall be Pure to the very end, and free. At last I see a poet's work Before me, worthy of the man, And, please God, I will never shirk The task, but carry out God's plan. Some hound would fain destroy? Not he! Unless his sword slips first through me. Her beauty brings my youth again. A girl's pure freshness can create Spring's gladness in the heart and brain And smooth the forehead grooved with Fate. The young sweet brilliance of her eyes Has changed life's sunset to sunrise. Her magnetism is so good, So pure, so sinless. When she came, Up to my very waist I stood Plunged in hell's waters, hot as flame: But now I think that there may be Perhaps a God,—yes, even for me. I dare not dream it. Yet I hope; I struggle with the old despair; Drowning, I cling to this frail rope; I worship her dark eyes and hair. I long to die for her. I long To make her deathless in my song. II. TWILIGHT. How strong my passionate love has grown! How strange and sad and hard to-day What once seemed easy seems! My own She is, and yet I may grow grey And she may never quite be mine: Can such a method be divine? Old doubt returns. Can God do this? Fill all my heart with love of thee; Put thy mouth to my own to kiss, And let me feel its purity; Make me each day discern thee fair, And worship more thine eyes and hair; Can he do this—did he inspire When thou wast (as thou art not now) In danger, my protective fire Of passion—listen to my vow That, come what would, thou shouldst be safe, However heart and flesh might chafe; O sweetheart, did God do this thing, Send me to save thee—and can he, The just great God, the mighty King, Now ravish all thy soul from me? Will some new hand approach, and reap The corn I sowed in agony deep? Aye, wilt thou marry? Shall I stand And see the glory fade away From this our own enchanted land? Will darkness be too strong for day? Is this what God demands at last? More pain—I thought the worst was past. Must I, who by those Northern streams Saw autumn shed upon the air Red leaves, and change the flowers of dreams To flowerless wastes of real despair— Must I, who saw my youth's sun set, In manhood meet a worse thing yet? And then she loves me. Yes, I know: For, when I kiss her darling head, It rises, ever so gently—so— And meets my lips. No word is said, And yet by that one simple sign I know the girl's pure heart is mine. Perhaps...and have I not the right? What man has better right than I? I've guarded her by day and night, Been sunlight in her midday sky, Starlight and moonlight through her sleep; I sowed the corn. May I not reap? I think I could reap, if I chose; For I have made her life so fair: Her every happiness she owes To me,—each breath of summer air That she respires, pure, sinless, free, She owes, and knows she owes, to me. Shall I not take her? Shall I stand Doubting, reluctant? Though I'm bound And wedded, would a God command That I should never quite be crowned By perfect love? This virgin's mine! I feel it: and the gift's divine. I've won her—surely? What can man Do more than I have done indeed? She needed succour. Lo! I ran To succour,—saved her at her need. Andromeda was rightly wed To Perseus, when her foe lay dead. I who the many-headed foe Of London selfishness have slain, Shall I in turn not surely know Reward for all my love and pain? Andromeda shall I not take, And on her lips my long thirst slake? A single monster Perseus slew: But I have toiled from day to day, Have fought beneath bright skies of blue, Have battled through the fog-wreaths grey, Have won for her wild countless fights And overthrown a thousand knights. Is she not mine beyond dispute? Mine: and my dear one knows it too. I kissed her fiercely; she was mute. So little now remains to do— To press my victory to the end, Become a lover, not a friend. Not friend!...Ah, would it be to lose The deep sweet friendship? Would it be To stain her pure mind, and confuse Her simple trusting thoughts of me? I cannot marry her. Would less Be wronging her beyond redress? Have I fought through a thousand fights, Unhorsed black-armoured foe on foe, Yet is there out of all the knights One knight still left me to lay low? Does one still bar me from the goal? The lower side of my own soul. Is, after all, myself the worst Of all my enemies?—Have I slain Thousands, and left their bodies cursed And sword-split helmets on the plain: Have I, with heart ready to break, Fought London for the woman's sake? And must I, having saved her now, And standing face to face alone With her, take on me a harder vow? Must love's fruits to the winds be thrown? Must I now with a stronger knight —Myself—wage this last deadliest fight? SONGS OF THE SEASONS I. SONG OF SPRING Very bright and very pure and very tender Is the golden sunlight on the laughing leaves: Very lovely is the early morning's splendour; Sweet the lilacs smell beneath the cottage-eaves. All things wake renewed to vigour and to passion. Lo! the daisies paint their pink tips, one by one: And the daffodils in their old shameless fashion Dip their robes in colour stolen from the sun. Lovers pass beneath the fragrance of the hedges, And they pause, half wild with wonder and with bliss— (While the river whispers, “See them!” to the sedges) And their lips seem soft as velvet, as they kiss. Blue the sky is, clear of cloud and free of sorrow. Such a noble height of rapture has been won That to-day's delight can dream not of to-morrow: All things worship at the altar of the sun. Yet the sweetness of the season gaineth sweetness From the thought of loving Jesus in the sky. Passion wins its utmost rapture and completeness Realizing that a loving heart is nigh. What is spring without the feeling that a Father Watches, blesses, every noble action done? —Sends the flowers of woman's love for man to gather! Sends the daisies to be gathered by the sun! II. SONG OF SUMMER Grand and glorious is the season of the roses. Spring has passed, but stronger sunlight gilds the corn. On the silver stream the lily's head reposes, And the ripple lifts it tenderly at morn. Love has deepened, with the deepening of the season. Love has strengthened, with the passing of the hours. Love has grown beyond the fear of change or treason. Love has stolen the glow and glory of the flowers. Man and woman understand and love each other. Through the silent leafy summer lanes they wend, Hand in hand. The blue sky smiles down like a mother And the gentle breeze of summer seems a friend. For in spring the heart of man was full of gladness, But in summer rapture gathers all its powers. Who can dream of sorrow, who can think on sadness, While the sky is full of stars, the fields of flowers? Yet the summer and its glory overflowing, Sun and moon and starlit height of purple sky, Silver stream and forest deep and blossoms blowing, All will pass. Yes, even roses have to die! But the sweetness of the Christ grows ever dearer As life's autumn strips the greenery of the bowers: And the beauty of another land seems nearer As the beauty of the summer quits the flowers. III. SONG OF AUTUMN When the leaves are whirling through the forest olden, Grey and green and brown and crimson dying leaves, Sodden leaves that only yesterday were golden, While the autumn wind-swept foliage sways and heaves, There are ghosts of lovers through the forest questing, Seeking vainly as their weary footsteps stray, Haunts they loved when all around the birds were nesting And the air was sweet with fragrance of the may. Weary ghosts they are of former happy lovers. Now they find no mossy carpet for their feet Spread within the oaken glades and hazel covers: Pale and tearful, in the forest-depths they meet. “Here was once a yellow primrose-bank,” they mutter. “Here we built a golden cowslip-throne,” they say. “From yon thicket, with a chirrup and a flutter, Dashed the brown thrush thro' the white and crimson may.” Is there any peace of mind for those who ponder In the autumn on the summer's vanished bloom, Save in hope that every blossom-spirit, yonder Far in heaven, exults triumphant o'er the tomb? Is there hope for human spirits pale and breathless With the struggle and the strife of every day? Just the hope that love's true flowers in heaven are deathless, Though death withers all the sweetness of the may. IV. SONG OF WINTER Dreary snows are all around us in the gardens, And the starlit frosty sky is chilly blue. On the silent stream the stifling cold ice hardens: The moon shivers at the air it travels through. Yet the sweetest of the seasons is the winter: Winter well may smile at summer's ardent scorn. When the air was keen with many an icy splinter, Love with summer at the heart of him was born. Love hath summer in his spirit never dying. Does it matter if the wild wind through the sprays Dashes, leaving all the tossing branches sighing? Does it matter if the snow-drifts pile the ways? For in winter through a humble heart and lowly God revealed himself to man. On Christmas morn Jesus Christ the pure of soul, the Saviour holy, Heedless of the bitter winter wind, was born. And the winter of the spirit—bitter sorrow— Who can banish, who can temper, if not he? Who but Jesus can remind us that to-morrow Shall be sunshine, though murk night is on the sea? For in winter, in the season when the berry Gleams, bright scarlet on the holly and the thorn, Men may feast, the saddest spirits may make merry: In the winter night the Prince of light was born. CHRIST IN THE HEART I. CHRIST, AND THE POETSatan. O poet, in whose brain and heart the sweetness Of summer reigns and glows, What bars thy life from rounding to completeness? Where findest thou thy foes? Thy foes are surely in the heavens above thee; God gazes down with scorn:— The golden stars and golden blossoms love thee, And the bright clouds of morn. Upon thy side thou hast the sunset-glory; The clouds in fiery mail. Each snowdrop whispers thee its pet love-story; Each crocus brings its tale. Thou wanderest singing by the river-edges, And lo! the ripples pause, And hush their love-song to the sighing sedges, To learn thy music's laws. Thou hast a power of endless loving-kindness, A love of all things born. But thee God hates. He'll close thine eyes with blindness! He'll pierce thy brows with thorn! The love of violets in the mossy hollows— This, poet, thou shalt win: The suffrages of the swift-wingéd swallows; The worship of the linn. The pure-souled snow-white lilies shall adore thee; The autumnal forest-glade Shall pour its gorgeous crimson foliage o'er thee; The summer boughs shall shade. Its rarest pearls the amorous sea shall fling thee, Pearls gathered from its breast. Strange priceless gems the humming-birds shall bring thee, Trinkets of throat or crest. The purple heather in the moorland regions Shall nestle round thy feet. The whole world's songsters, in their countless legions, Shall own thy song more sweet. And yet, thou poet, whatsoe'er thou doest, Thy toil shall end in gloom: When summer skies above thee beam their bluest, Prepare thou for the tomb!Poet. I love the bright blue heights of air, The sunlight in the morn: I love to watch that diamond rare, The dewdrop on a thorn. I love the white clouds in the skies, The blue waves by the land: But bluer yet are woman's eyes, And whiter is her hand.Satan. The morning's light shall pass away, It shall be dark at noon: And night shall lack the golden ray Of friendly star or moon. Thou lovest woman? She shall prove Thy direst bitterest woe. She loves thee? Yes: and she can love Thy neighbour even so!Poet. My song shall reach the frail and weak: The sad lost soul shall find That Christ's sweet pity still can speak To erring hearts and blind. Of all the crowns that I can win, This is the highest indeed— To save one woman's soul from sin; To guard her at her need.Satan. And having raised her quite from sin, Watch how the affair will end. The girl you spent your soul to win, Your fortune to befriend, Will—for a diamond brooch maybe, Or for much less than this— Barter the mouth your modesty Did not presume to kiss.Poet. I'll win, please God, a noble name, Do noble work indeed; Speak words of thunder, words of flame, Shake many a rotten creed. My words shall ring from land to land, And many a throne shall quake; The sword shall flash from many a hand For my strong singing's sake.Satan. Dream on, thou fool. The song wins less, The nobler that it be, The people's homage. Their caress Is won quite easily. Write folly, with a tinge of dirt: You surely will succeed. Bilge-water, through a penny squirt,— That is the chrism they need!Poet. I'll write high poems. I will pour Along my throbbing strain The wild winds' wail, the thunder's roar, The music of the main. Though many a bard has lived and died, Still golden sunrise gleams: The stars shine through night's palace wide, And fill my soul with dreams.Satan. A dream—that is the poet's life. But every dream shall end. The sweetheart changes to a wife (And then the stars descend!) The wife developes to a scold. The songs in which you trust Will mix with cabbages and mould, With cinders and with dust.Christ. O poet-heart, despair not.—Know That every song of thine Has made some angel's spirit glow; Yes: every noble line. All earthly joys thou hast to miss? Earth's hopes and passions end? Yet is it not sufficient bliss That Jesus calls thee “friend”? II. CHRIST, AND THE LOVERSatan. Lovelier is she than a poet's dreaming? Brighter are her eyes than starlight gleaming? Is the sun less golden than her hair? Did thy youth pass greyly and in sorrow? Weary, didst thou sleep—and on the morrow Didst thou wake, and find a goddess there?Lover. Lo! my soul was lost. Alone I wandered. By the deadly river-waves I pondered, Gazing in their dark and bitter flow. But my heart was changed, for true love found me: Took my weary life in hand, and crowned me: Spread across the heavens a sunset-glow.Satan. Sweet she is; but time's track never changes; Over all the golden fields he ranges, Flower-destroying. Shall he spare thy bliss? Pleasant are her lips; but time will chill them, Not for ever will the old sweetness fill them, Thou wilt tire before the thousandth kiss!Lover. I was lost and sad, and very weary. Through the gloom of life, the darkness dreary, Came the vision of a perfect thing. Autumn was it. Through the forest-arches, Underneath the October-yellowed larches, Came a presence fairer than of Spring.Satan. And again, when thou dost wax quite olden, Underneath the autumn foliage golden Thou shalt wander—wander quite alone. Death may love the lips thou lovest dearly; Death's grim bugle-call may ring out clearly, And her lips may answer with a moan.Lover. Surely God, who made this perfect creature, Set the stamp of heaven in every feature, Having given, will take her not away? Can God steal from heaven the stars that glitter? Slay the golden sun? Oh, that were bitter! Can he pour wild darkness over day?Satan. Even if she lives, thou wilt not know her When another fifty years shall show her Changed and gaunt and wrinkled to thy gaze. Hardly then thy changed heart shall remember Her who made the dark woods one September Sweeter than the woods of sunniest Mays.Lover. Darling! As the long years fleet and perish, With a tenderer sweet love will I cherish, Guard, protect, and tend, and worship thee. Never will my strong love change one tittle! Though the waves may eat away the brittle Rocks that seemed so stalwart round the sea!Satan. Long before one iron-bound cliff has faltered, Will thy love be changed in form and altered; While the stern cliffs still resist the wave, Passion will be but a distant glimmer. Slowly next thy love-thoughts will wax dimmer, Till at last they are ghosts around a grave.Lover. When we wandered in the golden morning Through the fields, we watched the flowers adorning Leaf and stalk and petal, every one. “See,” we said, “the blossoms' hearts are jealous! Each to outstrip her rival bloom is zealous, Each desires her sovereign lord, the sun.”Satan. And at night-time over field and garden Fall the moonrays, and the blossoms harden Heart and leaf and petal in the cold. When the sun arises in his splendour Dead are all those blossoms over-tender, Though he kissed them with his mouth of gold.Lover. Once I doubted all things, all things human; Railed at God, and scoffed at man and woman; Now I find a never dreamt-of bliss. God has sent me blessing for my curses, In his undeserved and priceless mercies Given me heaven in one pure woman's kiss.Christ. Lover: hold thy noble faith unshaken! Love her purely. If thy love be taken, Know that she is safe with God and me. Know that past the heavens, with angel sweetness In her face, she waits thy soul's completeness; Past the stars, the thunder, and the sea. III. CHRIST, AND THE MAN OF GENIUSMan. In youth I thought the world was bright; The starry fields were full of light: The grassy fields were full of bloom: But oh, how surely brightness goes! Full of high hopes, my life arose: Hopeless, it travelleth to the tomb.Satan. That is the end of all—to seek God's love, to burn to unfold and speak God's gospel to the human race, And then to hear death through the air Thunder his gospel of despair, Or lose all for a woman's face!Man. Of all the curses God can shower The heaviest surely is the dower Of genius, burthening heart and brain: To feel an ever-intenser woe Than others, or a rapturous glow So fierce it deepens into pain!Satan. That is your lot. For ever thus To teach immortal truths to us, Yet lonely through life's waves to steer. That is the glory of the thing: To carve, or write, or paint, or sing, Yet never find an audience here.Man. If God be true, I can endure, Struggle to be unselfish, pure: Yet fear I, judging by the past, Lest, like the brain of Talleyrand, The noblest genius in the land May mix with sewage at the last.Satan. That is the beauty of the thing! To think that mighty brains, which sing Of passionate joys and passionate pain And flowers and stars and sunlit skies, May serve, when once their owner dies, To choke a gutter or a drain.Man. To love more deeply, hour by hour, The simple beauty of a flower, The stars God's conjuring hand forthshook And yet to feel that all one's might Can add no one star to the night Nor one white lily to the brook!Satan. That is your helpless genius-dower. Man's song cannot create one flower: The mightiest sculptor time may send To mould the marble, cannot flush The white stone with the bright blood's blush; Cold marble is it to the end.Man. To know so much! to feel the right Far past the rampires of the night To penetrate to God's high throne! And yet to feel thought sinking back, Defeated, on the same old track, And to be left once more alone!Satan. Again the dower of genius, this. To madden for Jehovah's kiss; Right through the starlit rooms of space To hunt his shadow, endless task; To see God's eyes flash through his mask, But never to discern his face.Man. Prisoned to be by time and space! To long to have gazed on Jesus' face And seen the royal kindness there! The Churches tell us he arose. But when or how? what preacher knows? Their gods are ghosts, their words are air.Satan. You'll never know. And, when you die And think a passage through the sky Will open (as it oped for him!) You will be shoved i'the ground instead, And beetles round about your head Will gather for their gambols grim.Man. To know what noble souls have died, And what sweet women! to be tied For ever to an English blonde. Never to know the exact rich bliss Which pulsed through Cleopatra's kiss! This makes a passionate soul despond.Satan. Aye, God will let thy spirit dream: But when it comes to facts, I deem He'll not send beauty to thy bed. Her whom thy lust would stretch out there He'll marry to a green-grocer, And send thee an ill-breath'd bride instead.Man. To yearn across death's solemn night So thunder-dark, yet see no light Of one dead well-loved starry face Flash out for all one's yearning! this Last sadness lurks within each kiss; This coldness thrills through each embrace.Satan. Yes: when thy mother dies, thy friend, Thy wife, thy sweetheart, that's the end, The end of all—be sure of this. Kiss while thou canst. Within the tomb No widower wins a young girl's bloom. Death proffers not a second kiss.Man. To peer between life's prison-bars And watch those golden ships, the stars; Yet never in life, or death maybe, To board a single star-ship! no. For ever through heaven's deeps we go, Yet hail no consort on the sea.Satan. The same with life. The human soul Is like your earth-ship. Though its goal May lie beyond eternity, Alone for ever it must steer And never through all ages hear One true voice hail across the sea.Christ. O genius-heart, be brave and strong. When thou despairest, suffering long, Think on my life, remember me. Thy soul soars on, all stars of space Sail on, before my Father's face, And harbourage lies beyond the sea. IV. CHRIST, AND THE POOR MANSatan. All thou see'st of splendour and of sweetness, Gulf and river, rock and wood and wave, All that wealth can bring life of completeness, If thou wilt but trust me, thou shalt have.Man. I am happy in my humble garden, Happy 'mid the red geraniums there: Happy, when the good God breathes his pardon And his blessing down the starlit air.Satan. Pardon! not of God need'st thou crave pardon: Rather let him pardon ask of thee. Why should thine hands change to horn and harden, While another lives in luxury?Man. Yet the unequal lot is God's appointing. Happier am I in my humble sphere Than the Pope, for all his proud anointing, Or the king with courtiers at his ear.Satan. King thou art by right. The rich man's slumbers One day shall thy legions rudely break. True, the wealth is his. But thou hast numbers. Strike! for thy seduced sad daughters' sake.Man. That thought maddens. That, and that thought only Drives the avenging blood to heart and head— That the rich man leaves his wife's couch lonely While he wantons in a work-girl's bed.Satan. King thou art,—the sole true monarch, doubtless. Had the myriads of the northern Czar Seen this sooner, his red hand were knoutless, And their hands had snapped each prison-bar.Man. Dreams of fierce and blood-stained revolution, These are born of darkness and of thee. We retain, through Europe's wild confusion, Hearts made clear by sunshine and the sea.Satan. Yes: the sea is free. Its waves would cheer you Onward to the final grim attack. Think what boundless wealth is ever near you! What a city London were to sack!Man. Yet the Thames, with its strong eddying waters Curling downward to the sea's blue plain, Seems to plead for English wives and daughters. Shall we make it blood-red like the Seine?Satan. Wives and daughters! when did ever wealthy Strong man, covetous of girl or bride, Hesitate by violent means or stealthy To abduct your weak one from your side?Man. Yet I look for days of equal measures, Work for all men, healthy homes for each: Laws to guard the poor man's best loved treasures— Daughter, wife, and liberty of speech.Satan. These are going, unless you bestir you. Sword and bayonet, truncheon, gag, and chain; Workhouse-prisons wherein to inter you Living; these the gifts are ye will gain.Man. If the end be this, not ever thunder Through the midnight with such fury rolled As will wild revolt, while weak fools wonder, Through the long streets where they hide their gold.Satan. Grand! let every continental nation, Awe-struck at the English workmen's might, Watch the multitudinous devastation And the balefires flashing through the night.Man. If it ever comes to such an issue, Deadly, desperate, will the mad fight be. Down will crumble walls like paper tissue, When hoarse riot charges like the sea.Satan. Famous! I will head the workmen rallying Through the Parks and Squares with banners red. When the Life-Guards through their gates come sallying, Whitehall shall be choked with cuirassed dead!Man. Never Paris saw so fierce a battle Through its long and sanguine-tinted days. When the Guards' drums through the dense fog rattle, We'll reply by our revolvers' blaze.Satan. Princely! that will be a noble sample To the nations round, and yet to be. English artizans shall set the example. Let the surging red flags follow me!Man. Then the rich man's foot within his garden In his brother's blood perchance shall slip. Stately duchesses shall sue for pardon, Kneeling 'mid our ranks with ashen lip.Satan. Glorious! when the captured girls are waiting, While their fathers' hot blood licks the sewers, Splashing red down gutter and through grating, I will whisper, “What of girls of yours?”Man. This is certain—If that day of thunder Ever breaks on London, those who see Will behold hell's barriers burst asunder, Fiends unchained, and raging devils free.Christ. Satan, when the hell-gates leap asunder, Dreading lest some flippant sword-edge scar, Fearful lest some heedless bullet blunder, Safe will lurk, observing from afar! V. CHRIST, AND THE SOCIAL REFORMERReformer. The world is perfect as God made Its heights of sunlight, depths of shade: God's image in it we restore.Satan. Your pupils daub the world with mud: Or else will send a sea of blood Circling along from shore to shore.Reformer. The world was perfect. Leaf and flower, Starlight and moonlight, sun and shower, Fulfil the high God's perfect will.Satan. And ye will add a starlight new When, torch in hand, ye issue through The portals, to consume and kill.Reformer. What lessons for the race are there— In the heavenly depth of starlit air. What truths the star-land has to teach!Satan. The proletariate little cares About the lessons of the stars: It has its dirty shirts to bleach.Reformer. Astronomy. What nobler lore? Or from the sea-weeds on the shore To educe the laws of life and growth.Satan. Nay! stuff your pockets full of sweets. The children gathered from the streets Like bull's eyes best, I'll take my oath.Reformer. Such small things teach, if man would learn— The heather's bell, a tuft of fern: God's signs are seen in every spot.Satan. The people's sign-boards point the way To where, at foggy close of day, The fieriest brandy can be got.Reformer. Ah! in the future we shall bring To bear the lessons of the spring, The teaching of the summer rose.Satan. And find that those you would uplift Would rather you would let them drift Straight to damnation, in repose.Reformer. A genius grand is in the poor. Behold, we open Music's door And let the poor man enter in.Satan. Try them with Beethoven, Mozart. But don't be angry, do not start, If Vance and short-skirt ballets win.Reformer. The picture-galleries we will ope On Sundays. There, our leaders hope, The working-man will take his wife.Satan. On Sundays, as a general rule, The workman thumps her with a stool, Or jobs her with the carving-knife.Reformer. The noblest singing they shall hear. We'll train their fancy, train their ear, The grandest thoughts to comprehend.Satan. And find that they—yes, one and all— Would rather see at a Music Hall The white-eyed Kaffir. Yes, my friend.Reformer. Christ was the first who understood The people,—saw the undreamed-of good Latent in heart and hand and head.Satan. And therefore on the cross he died, And all the fickle people cried, “Give us Barabbas in his stead!”Reformer. The whole world lies before us. Wide Its wonders stretch on every side. Vast are the truths life has to teach!Satan. The people you would lift so high Would much prefer—though you may sigh— To crack their nuts on Brighton beach.Reformer. The children shall make holiday Among the flowers and fragrant hay, And love the beauty of the flowers.Satan. They love the gutters and the mud. I've seen a dead rat's skin and blood Amuse a blue-eyed child for hours.Reformer. They'll leave the stifling town at morn, And watch the sunshine on the corn And butterflies with wings snow-white.Satan. Children pull off flies' wings, you know. I've often watched them doing so, And revelled in the dainty sight.Reformer. A long day by the sea's white foam! They shall sing hymns, returning home, And ever love the blue-waved sea.Satan. Sing hymns! Through Lambeth when I walk The tiny children's filthy talk Is really shocking, even to me.Reformer. If only we can educate The shop-girls; force the sluggish State To educate them, one and all.Satan. Men train them in such different ways: Opinions differ in these days: I think they're sweetest, when they fall.Reformer. Once educate—then all is well. Love can redeem the lost from hell, And shield the soul sin would destroy.Satan. Sin? That is such an ugly name. A sealskin jacket means the same, And sounds more delicate, my boy!Reformer. Work hard; keep sober; rule your tongue; Love truly, chastely; marry young. Domestic joys are joys which last.Satan. My work-girls dread domestic bliss. Why sell your freedom, when you kiss? Marriage is dying out quite fast.Reformer. I see the good in every one. You count the spots upon the sun, And in the fairest find a sin.Satan. My eyes are microscopic. Yes. I stand by when the girls undress, And count the blotches on their skin.Reformer. Is all life's labour then in vain? Long effort, struggle, bitter pain. Must evil still outbalance good?Satan. The great Reformer, Jesus, died With ruffian-robbers at each side, Nailed on a common cross of wood.Reformer. That seemed like failure—dismal, vast. The bright stars must have gazed aghast, When loving Jesus had to die.Satan. It was the death-blow of his dream. The soldiers saw the blood-drops stream, And laughed to see them. So did I.Christ. On every Church in Christian lands To-day my cross as symbol stands Of mine eternal victory. VI. CHRIST, AND THE KINGKing. Leagues and leagues of rolling upland, leagues and leagues of mountain ground, Leagues and leagues of stormy waters where the giant surges sound, These are mine, and mine for ever. Through the farthest East I reign, And the rivers wait my mandate ere they plunge into the main.Satan. Lord thou art of all things clearly, lord of day and lord of night. In the morn the sun thy servant pays thee homage, brings thee light. At the eve the stars thy servants cast their crowns before thy feet, And thy women do thee service even softer and more sweet.King. Are there lands yet left to conquer? I am weary, though I reign Over mountain, mead, and valley—over river, rock, and plain. Are there hearts yet left to conquer? Are there women more divine Than the girls whose golden tresses at my palace windows shine?Satan. Wealth and kingship last for ever, and all pleasures can be brought To thy feet, O mighty Ruler! Thou need'st stint thyself in nought. Plunge from pleasure into pleasure, as a bather in the sea Leaps from breaker into breaker. Trust thy future unto me.King. Yet I dread the far-off future—sometimes wake up in my bed, Pause from dallying with the glory of a woman's golden head, Pause half frightened, with the sweetness of her kiss upon my mouth, Hearkening as the thunder summons its loud legions from the South.Satan. Dream not of the far-off thunder. Death and thunder are so far. Lo! to-night my slaves shall bring thee, when the evening's lonely star Through the silence of the heavens drives its chariot wrought of pearl, An untouched and trembling maiden. Take thy pleasure with the girl.King. Yet an end will come of pleasure. Through the desert monsters moan, And the ghosts of those I've vanquished haunt the stairway of my throne. Deep in blood my feet have waded. Must I wade for evermore Through red waters? Must my footsteps in my palace slip in gore?Satan. Kings have need to stifle scruple. Kings must sweep their foes away, As the current sweeps the sea-weed round the circle of the bay. Lo! thou art a mighty monarch. Thou hast taken to thy bed Wives of foemen without number, and hast laid their husbands dead.King. Star by star the high heaven opens, full of wonder is the night. I am ruler in my palace. Here a million lamps are bright: Here a thousand women wait me.—God is mightier, mightier far! Lord he is of heaven's blue regions, far beyond the faintest star.Satan. Art thou envious of Jehovah? Canst thou never be content? Lo! the whole wide earth I give thee—sea, and isle, and continent. Thou hast served me, served me truly. Lord thou art of earth and hell. Must thou lust for powers beyond thee, crave for God's high heaven as well?King. Nay, I drive the fancy from me. Bring me women, bring me wine! Let the girls dance wanton measures till their smooth limbs seem divine! Let the captives suffer torture! Let the tigers crowd the ring! I will watch them tear the prisoners. I will live and die a king.Satan. That is better, that is braver. That is speech I love to hear. The proud vaunting of a monarch rings like music in my ear; And I love to see the captives drag their entrails in the dust, For the sight of blood is pleasant, and it whets a monarch's lust.King. Yes, when all the sports are over and the fierce arena clears, I feel joyous and feel tender. Then I weary of the spears And the bleeding and the fighting, and I long for sleep and rest, And to kiss the pale-pink nipple on a maiden's balmy breast.Satan. True: the glory of a monarch is to slay the husband first, To watch anguish do his bidding, to see torture do its worst; Then at night-time, past the turmoil and the throbbing of the strife, To let passion do its utmost on the body of the wife.King. Bid the people throng together. They shall own me king and lord. God may rule by loving-kindness. I will sway men by the sword. I will light red fires of torment that shall leap between the bars Of the prisons, and extinguish God's pale candle-light, the stars.Satan. Canst thou not devise a torment newer than the fires' old blaze? Write in blood a noble poem that shall ring through endless days? Mothers hast thou ripped in sunder, wrenched the babes from out their womb, Tossed the infants on thy spear-points, closed the living in the tomb—King. There are fifteen hundred prisoners in the dungeons of the town: There are fifteen hundred diamonds wanted for my royal crown. Let the diamonds wait a little. I can scent a rarer prize. There are fifteen hundred prisoners. Bring me fifteen hundred eyes.Satan. That is glorious, that is kingly. That is past expression grand. Ruled there ever such a monarch o'er so fortunate a land? His right eye each prisoner loses, but the left eye still remains. See how mercy kisses judgment! See how just a monarch reigns!King. There are half a thousand captives in the fortress, prisoned deep. They shall writhe amid their life-blood, twining in a tangled heap. Break their legs, and hurl them living in the ditch beside the tower. All who pass shall see them rotting, for a token of my power.Satan. Better still, aye even better! That is past all language fine, And the genius that devised it in its greatness matches mine. Judgment once more kisses mercy, and with tenderness is blent. Break their legs, don't kill them outright. Give them five days to repent.King. Bid the people throng together. I will make a royal feast. Let the lamps at night be lighted. I am king on earth at least. If vast angel-hosts in heaven wait Jehovah's stern command, Round about me fifty thousand of the desert's spearmen stand.Satan. Who shall wait thee in thy palace, when the feasting all is done? When the lamps before the moon fly, as she flies before the sun. When thy head with merry feasting and with laughter reels and whirls, Who shall wait thee of thy smooth-limbed satin-bosomed supple girls?King. Let the girl to-night be ready, who last night upon my bed Lay so snowlike on the velvet (Let the tigers wait unfed). In the afternoon the circus, and the blood-stained combat's charms: But at night the king's the captive, prisoned in a woman's arms!Christ. King, to-night when solemn darkness closes down on land and sea Thou shalt meet the only Ruler who hath kingship over thee. Thou hast made the pale stars tremble on their thrones within the sky; But to-night thy soul shall tremble, for to-night thou hast to die. VII. CHRIST, AND THE PHILOSOPHERPhilosopher. Could the good without the evil ever hold out for an hour Never!—Every lady strutting in her grand silk down the street, Full of pureness like an angel, full of beauty like a flower, Were it not for the poor harlot would be never half so sweet.Satan. True, the Force that moulded all things is dramatic at the core; Has its due sense of proportion; sets the good beside the base; Flings the millionaire his nuggets; plants the beggar at his door; Shapes the cripple as a contrast to the young girl full of grace.Philosopher. Often, very very often, do I chuckle to myself, Watching how the good souls struggle, thinking God is on their side. God is far too good an artist to put evil on the shelf: God's superbest Rembrandt-picture was when Christ was crucified.Satan. Yes, I watched with keenest pleasure that strange scene upon the hill. Deeply would you have enjoyed it, could you only have been there. Judas played his part divinely. Pontius backed him with a will. Mary “made up” to perfection, purple robe and golden hair.Philosopher. People rail at crime and murder. Yet the pleasure these imply! Christians sitting at their breakfast o'er their sausage and their toast, Reading in the morning paper that a murderer is to die, Feel a thrill of keen excitement. Murders have a charm for most.Satan. Strange it would be if Jehovah whom the people worship here Should be like a Spanish maiden at a bull-fight, in her place. As she needs its wild excitement, so he needs perhaps to peer From the windows of his palace on the death-pangs of the race.Philosopher. Crimes have sprung from many causes—from the love of wealth and power, From the lust of man for woman; yet beyond conception odd Is it that the Inquisition, of iniquities the flower, Sprang from lust of man for heaven, and from love of man for God.Satan. Therefore is there need most urgent that a newer creed be taught: That the gospel of pure reason should be preached, with all it brings: That mankind should be instructed that God only lives in thought And that he himself is sovereign, the sole living king of kings.Philosopher. Day by day to feel more self-poised, day by day to grow more grand: Day by day to learn new secrets of the silent starry lore: To feel ever the brain strengthening in its power to understand; That is worth the pain of living, though the pain of life be sore!Satan. All the skies are sundered for thee, all the secrets of the deep Blue tremendous heaven are opened to thy keen and searching look. Thou canst count the murky portals, whence the fiery thunders leap. Thou canst enter the wild comets, name by name, within thy book.Philosopher. This is life's end, this is rapture. This is man's sufficient goal. Far away in bygone ages the great Roman poet saw That the secret of true godship is within the human soul, And that all the worlds together move by never-changing law.Satan. Yes. Lucretius, whom I aided in his godlike labour, knew That man's dreams of God were baseless—that the only God indeed, Strong, eternal, self-sufficient, deathless, vast, triumphant, true, Is the soul of man transcending every form of every creed.Philosopher. Prayer has ever been a weakness. Self-sufficient life is grand. When the soul of man is strengthened, when the soul of man is free, He will grow by law eternal, like the blossoms of the land; He will move by changeless impulse, like the tides within the sea.Satan. Through the ages I have wrestled with the dreamers of each race, With the poets, with the thinkers, with the lords of prose and rhyme; Teaching that the glory of manhood is for ever thus to pace, Prayerless, faithless, creedless, godless, on the foam-swept shores of time.Philosopher. Once I prayed: but that is over. Once I hoped: but that is past. It was but a moment's weakness. Now my inmost soul is strong. I have won the perfect endless philosophic calm at last. I have conquered in the struggle, though the strife was fierce and long.Satan. Teach the people thy strong secret. Teach the uselessness of prayer. Teach that man's sufficient godship in his own soul he must find. Teach that faith in God is harmful; both a weakness and a snare. To the doubting bring assurance, and bring light unto the blind.Philosopher. I can see—my reason shows me—that of all the faiths of man, Faith in God is most degrading! The soul shivers at the thought. What! an Eye has followed history since our history first began. What! no deed in noble silence and in darkness has been wrought.Satan. If an Eye eternal follows, through the sunlight and the shade, Ye are like the prisoners followed by the warder's sleepless eye. Night and day your God observes you through the peep-holes he has made In the heavens, flashing on you his star-lanterns from the sky.Philosopher. Yes, the thought is most degrading. If we marry, even then Not a moment free from spying, though the darkness may be deep! Every kiss by God is counted—fifty, twenty, thirty, ten— For the Eye eternal watches man and woman when they sleep.Satan. Not one deed is wrought in private, if the Christian creed be true. Not a man can kiss in private, not a young girl can be got. For the Eye eternal pierces all the cloudland, flashes through; And it fathoms every secret, and it searches every spot.Philosopher. Oh far nobler is the silence, as Lucretius felt and saw, Of the boundless starlit heavens, and the silence of the sea, And the silent sure progression of unalterable law. Let the Christians crown their Jesus. Give the godless void to me!Satan. Yes, for free from wrath and tumult may the soul of man abide Where no gods can ever harass, where no gods can ever slay. Unobserved save of the starlight then a man may hold his bride. Followed only by the sunlight may a man pursue his way.Philosopher. Then the soul in its completeness stands for evermore alone. Could it steer its thought-ship boldly to the farthest shores of space, Never would its keel encounter one rock-fragment of God's throne: Never would the darkness open and reveal the Eternal's face.Satan. That is strength: to steer right onward, seeking nothing from on high— Neither guidance, love, nor counsel. Do the star-ships, when they steer Never failing, never foundering, through the storm-shoals of the sky, Say “God help us!” or “God guide us!” If they said so, would God hear?Philosopher. No: they sail their course eternal through the darkness of the night, And they strike not one another, though no helmsman's hand there be! Twilight draweth back for darkness, darkness giveth place to light, Morning brings its golden sunshine, yet no wrecks are on the sea!Satan. Ever o'er the airy waters will the star-ships sail secure, For the force that leads them onward is but matter's restless hand. If a living God convoyed them, could their pathway be more sure? If a conscious helmsman guided, could their course be better planned?Philosopher. Worse it would be, worse in all ways. For the conscious God might sleep. Constellations might be kindled! starry clusters might consume! If he left the helm a moment, half a million suns might leap Down the breathless airy cliff-sides and plunge ages into gloom!Satan. Rest in peace. Believe and doubt not, for the truth I tell to thee. Godless was the primal darkness, and the first waves felt no hand Rein them when they charged with rapture o'er the green floor of the sea, Nor was God within the sunlight when it first caressed the land.Philosopher. That is all I crave for—freedom from the oppressive sense of One Ever gazing through the myriads of the stars that gem the sky, Ever speaking in the sea-waves, ever shining in the sun; Just to handle my own soul's helm, and to feel that I am I.Christ. Not in all the pride of reason can my Father take delight; Not in genius does he glory, not in stubborn force of will; But he hears the sad soul praying through the silence of the night, And he speaks in solemn sweetness to the childlike spirit still. VIII. CHRIST, AND THE LOST WOMANWoman. Of old the river-banks were sweet.— The waves played round my girlish feet, As in the brook I gathered cress. I stooped. Then, quicker than a thought, The wicked ripples laughed and caught The bright skirt of my Sunday dress.Satan. And who came through the wood that day, With face so handsome, step so gay, And eyes in which no evil seemed? And who, found standing in the brook, Blushed childlike at his laughing look And then went home, and cried, and dreamed?Woman. It was a dream, and nothing more.— I see him standing on the shore: I see the blossoms by the stream: I hear my mother ask me why That night I seemed so strange and shy, Pacing the house as in a dream.Satan. Was it a dream that followed—town; Long rows of houses, smoky brown; And then one night a dainty bed In the grand house he took you to; Wild kisses all the long night through, Till morning flamed out rosy-red?Woman. A dream, a wicked sinful dream! My mother's stern words ghostlike seem, Which warned me when I fled away: His kisses on my lips are ghosts: Grey phantoms are that bed's tall posts, And spectral is that dawn of day.Satan. And was the blue-eyed child a dream Who, like a moment's sunny beam, Flashed o'er your life one golden spark? You loved the father in the child, And half with fate were reconciled. God stole your darling. All was dark!Woman. God took the baby. Better so. He had his father's glance, I know. I would not that my womb should bear A child who, in the days to come, Might lure the heedless to their doom And goad some girl's heart to despair.Satan. Nay, had the child become a man And ended what his sire began, That would have been dramatic, great. He might have seen some other girl At play where the blue waters curl Beside your mother's cottage gate!Woman. Thank God, he died! The poor thin child— I loved it with a passion wild, The only love-power left in me. And yet I hardly cared to groan When I was wholly left alone, A wreck upon life's tossing sea.Satan. And yet he would have spared you gold, Had you but written. But you sold Your honour, sank so foully low. What can a man of character (The best-intentioned) do for her Who fancies profligacy so?Woman. Love once and lose, then all is lost For woman. Man can love a host Of women, so he fancies—yes. Our love is agony or bliss. We give one man an angel's kiss: We give the rest a fiend's caress.Satan. An over-subtle point to me That seems, and quite a travesty Of amorous joys and love-delight. No: on the whole I hold with man That every girl's the same who can Be sweet companion for a night.Woman. A man can love a thousand girls. Smooth black soft tresses, yellow curls, Blue eyes, fierce dark eyes,—all are one. Man finds a thousand faces fair; Loves all the stars that fill the air. Woman is faithful to the sun.Satan. Woman loves once, and that's the end! Then, when her lover, or her “friend,” Forsakes her, what is left to seek? The river.—Which makes clear to me The folly of her theory, And proves her reasoning false and weak.Woman. The river? Yes. It flows along: Not as of old with sweet soft song Near Oxford, past my mother's door. There is no may-bloom on its banks; No tall green reeds in rustling ranks; This moonlight gilds a flowerless shore.Satan. Plunge in, and get it over.—You Keep dreaming of the old waves of blue That once you watched with girlhood's eyes. The moon that parts yon cloudy rack Peers down from heaven on wavelets black To-night. You are in town. Arise!Woman. My life is dark as is the stream. It once was bright with flash and gleam Of love's own sunlight, like the wave. But now the stream and I are one: We have bade farewell to the sun: The moon shall light us to our grave.Satan. Man cares not. God? He does not care. One moment's flash of golden hair Upon the surface of the stream, Then all is over. You make way For a new suicide next day, And pass from man's sight like a dream.Woman. I wonder, is the water cold? Drowning is pleasant, I've been told. The morning sun is far-off yet. I wonder, is it hard to die? Others have drowned—and so can I. One plunge—and then I shall forget!Satan. Not one soul loves you. Quick, my girl! How pleasantly the waters curl: The moon is shining nicely, too. My spirits are leading from the Strand Another young girl by the hand: Hurry—or she may jostle you!Woman. Just let me fold this poor old shawl And lay it down behind the wall, And hat and gloves and necktie. There... The water looks so cool and deep— If I can pluck up heart to leap, There will be no more pain to bear!Christ. Pause: for thou art not quite alone. Far-off in heaven I heard thee moan, And through the starlit silent sky I hastened, as of old, to save. My love is stronger than the grave, And mightier than man's enmity. A VOICE FROM HEAVEN Each evening on the ethereal canvas wide I paint new sunsets, colouring all the air. When Turner failed and flung his brush aside, I touched the heaven,—the longed-for tint was there. Yet who will gaze each evening at the sky? Who cares to contemplate my work supreme? Unnoticed, shade by shade, the bright tints die. Man lusts for gold, while God and poets dream. When my sonorous thunder-pæans sound, What audience have I in the heights of space? When my stars fill the air for leagues around, Frail man is staring in some harlot's face. Alone I travel o'er the shoreless sky; Alone in labour, and in pain and strife. I cross the surges of eternity While man sails round the land-locked bay of life. What genius-loneliness is like to mine? Man shapes one statue, or he paints one face; A poet's soul lives in one single line, A woman's beauty in one curve of grace: Upon one earth ye suffer and ye groan: Your Jesus for one suffering sad world died: But I—for ever past my lonely throne Sweeps the great stars' illimitable tide. I rule new nations in vast star on star: My thought creates new eras, one by one. I steer across the blue sky's harbour-bar Daily the giant ship ye call the sun. Nor only one sun. Through the waves of space Millions of sun-ships plunge upon their way. I am the sole spectator of their race: My touch upon the helm they all obey. And yet my love can pulse through space and time. Does one sad woman in the wintry gloom, Despairing, maddened through another's crime, Wait, while the dark waves tempt her to her doom? Does one frail heart of woman long to die, Hurling her sorrow deep into the wave? There is the God of all things. There am I. There is the love that even yet can save. There is the love that from the central throne Listening can hear the accents of despair: Can hear through all the stars a woman's moan; Answer the strong man's agony of prayer. Aye, if hell's ocean seeks to swallow one Frail human sinner, blood-stained though he be The love of God will bid the mighty sun Rescue the sinner, and dry up the sea. NATURE AND HUMANITY I. NATURE I. SONG OF THE FLOWERS Spring, risen and light-crowned, touched the slumbering flowers In deep green bowers: They bloomed and loved and sang, and praised their King. “Rise from your rest, O sisters sweet, for soon It will be June, The world will need our fragrant comforting!” So spake the rose; And from repose The countless hosts of sister-roses woke. They filled the air With fragrance rare, As morning after summer morning broke. Then came the violets in their myriads too, Arrayed in blue, Save some, the tenderest, who were robed in white. All sang to heaven their song of perfect praise, And filled the ways With scent divine by day, though most by night. Yes, most by night, For then the light Of the enchantress moon is over each: And then you hear, Low, silver-clear, The tender murmur of the flowers' soft speech. Then rose to rose, lily to lily speaks. Then by the creeks, Whereover pours a flood of moonlight pale, Gentle forget-me-not and iris bold, Blue, streaked with gold, Converse, and love lifts from their hearts its veil. “Lo! God is good”— In the green wood Thus spake a wild rose to its sister nigh: “See'st thou up there Those star-flowers fair? Those are what roses come to, when they die! “Yes, sister, roses die,—and then they light The whole wide night; They change to what men call the ‘stars’ above: And then for endless ages they shine through The endless blue, And thrill the souls of men to dreams of love. “No blossoms die: The whole wide sky Receives, and turns to stars their silvery bloom. The fields of air That gleam up there Receive us, sister, in their azure tomb. “Just for one little moment here we dream, And then we gleam For ever set upon the brow of space: Aye, then with exultation we shall find —God is so kind!— Another and a deathless dwelling-place. “Here we delight For one sweet night One pair of lovers with our breath most sweet: But when we die We shall supply Light to a thousand fond hearts when they meet.” So spake to a sister-flower the pale pink rose, Like one who knows The secrets of the stars and of the night. And then two lovers came, and plucked the rose— And now it glows Doubtless amid the stars, and gives man light. What once was breath Most sweet, in death Has been transfigured into higher bloom: The rose once flowered, But now is dowered With light, to gleam across the purple gloom. Praise, love and praise. This ever was the word The flower-souls heard: They caught no distant note of Satan's psalm. The fragrant wondrous flower-world's vast content With joy was blent, And infinite repose, and ceaseless calm. “O sun gold-red,” The daisy said, “Thou art so grand, and yet thou copiest me! My heart of gold I now behold In the blue waves, reflected back from thee!” The violet whispered, as it gazed on high, “O deep-blue sky, Thou steal'st my hues. I love thee for the theft!” The sky laughed out to hear the violet's speech; Pure love filled each: “Love,” sang the green ferns in the granite-cleft. “Love,” sang the sun; And from his throne To fill the daisy's heart he sent down rays, Till it became One golden flame, A golden sunflower flashing back his gaze. And then a lily in the garden-bed, Lifting her head, Said to her sister, “Happiness is ours, Indeed. We live but for a little while, And yet our smile Is deathless. Yes: the good God loves his flowers. “In pale sick-rooms Some lily blooms: The sufferer's sad eye kindles as it sees The dainty stem, White diadem, And fragrant heart that maddened once the bees. “Nothing is lost.—We bloom but for a day, And yet we stay For ever in the soul that found us fair. We lift and comfort; we redeem and save: Yes, even the grave Grows beautiful, when lilies enter there. “The ghost-moths white That flit by night Around our stalks, and through the grass-blades dry, Were lilies. Now From bough to bough Their white wings carry them. We shall not die! “Nothing can die. All things but shift and grow, With progress slow: The lovers we have seen beside us stand Will grow to angels—as the lilies change To ghost-moths strange— And win their gold wings in another land. “Praise God, who makes The hills and lakes; Whose hand can guard whate'er his heart hath given: The golden air, The sun up there, The stars that whisper, ‘We are flowers of heaven.’” II. SONG OF THE RIVERS I. With ripples tuned to silver song Our current foams and leaps along. On either hand the green reeds close: We see the brown bee rob the rose. Upon the hedge its petals gleam: The red rose closed its eyes to dream. Into its heart the quick bee goes, And sucks its sweetness from the rose. Within our safe strong-timbered locks The painted shallop sways and rocks: Beneath our waves the pike darts by, And all the timorous grey roach fly. The white-sailed ghostly cutters glide Along our curves and reaches wide: And now the river-steamer too Cuts with keen keel the waters blue. Fleet racing-boats with eager force Along our current steer their course. Past piers and London wharfs we flow: We lap stone walls with ripples slow. We hear love whispered on the breeze, And underneath our neighbouring trees. White hands lean from the boat's bright edge, And draw up lilies draped with sedge. The spotted trout flash through the deep, And up the weir great salmon leap. The angler's fly says, “If you dare, Snap at me!” to the dace down there. Along the stream gold fields of corn Shine underneath the sun at morn: And in the afternoon they seem, Mist-clad, like cornfields in a dream. We, rivers light of heart and gay, Chant through the whole long summer day; And, when the harvest moon is up, We make love to the cowslip cup. The ragged-robin on our edge Whispers “Good evening” to the sedge. The red kine come to cool their feet In our clear waves in August heat. The country girls wash clothes, and laugh, And hollowing hands, our waves they quaff. A thousand slight things fill the day— Then, when the sunset fades away, The yellow moon above our banks Rises, discerned through tall green ranks Of rushes on the water-line: Then one by one the bright stars shine. All is so lovely in our life: So free from labour, sorrow, strife. We thank the God who gave his streams Their day of toil, their night of dreams. Dreams very tender,—seldom sad. We watch the eyes of lovers glad: We hear the maiden's whispered “I Shall love you, darling, till I die.” We hear the strong man answer: “Love, Our love will last till heights above Receive us. True love cannot die: It shares the stars' eternity.” We hear, and we are glad. We float More buoyantly the lovers' boat. With tender thoughts we watch it gleam Adown the darkness of the stream. II. The memories of our mountains still Are with us.—Each was once a rill, Swift, foaming down some mountain's edge, And tumbling on from ledge to ledge. Then large the greatening river grew, And deeper yet, and yet more blue. Great towns it passed,—and then began To carry out the schemes of man. The white-sailed ships pursued their course Along the river,—used its force. It floated lilies in past hours, But now it floated ships for flowers! Yet, deepening ever in our flow, As we bear commerce to and fro, We feel, if youth's first dreams are lost, The gain is worthy of the cost. In countries many, mighty and great, We aid man's tasks, we share man's state; Where were the glory of the Thames Without its steamers' iron stems? What were the grandeur of the Seine, Unshadowed by the historic fane? Highly the Seine 'mid rivers ranks, For Notre Dame is on its banks. And Westminster's grey stately towers Are worth the loss of early flowers That Nuneham flung, or Oxford threw, From golden fields on waters blue. III. Thus, deepening onward, carrying ships, Kissing the air with statelier lips, Stream after stream must ever tend On towards its God-appointed end. The end is grand, the end is sure: In front, a heaven of waters pure And vast and stainless waits the stream— A waste wherein its soul may dream Dreams kinglier far than dreams that sped About it in the days long dead; Old dreams of mountains robed in mist, Far meadows by the sunlight kissed. This waits us when our work is done: A night wherethrough can pierce no sun; A depth no starlight from the air Can traverse,—nor can moon gleam there. This waits us. Deep our souls shall rest Within the mighty ocean's breast. Rill, river, stream—We all shall be Lost in the greatness of the sea. III. SONG OF THE SEA I. Bright sunsets come and go Above my waters' flow: The gold stars rise and set: But I am young as yet. I saw the first star gleam Above my grey-blue stream: Before the race of man I, the great sea, began. When man's race dies away, My green waves still will play Round granite echoing shores That echo not to oars. God dwells upon his throne, And I on mine, alone. Though all things else should die, We could not,—he and I. The sun has amorous hours With golden plains of flowers. He flashes through the trees: He gilds the emerald leas. His are the inland nooks, The birch-trees, and the brooks: The orchids, white or pied, The daisies, golden-eyed. His are the birds that sing His praises in the spring: The larch is his,—the fir, The rainbow-gossamer. His is the hazel-copse; His are the mountain-tops, And valleys green and sweet Where flocks in thousands bleat. His heart can find repose In kissing the red rose. He fills with love-desire The newly blossomed briar. The gemlike humming-bird Is gladdened at his word. What birds and flowers love me, The ever-ravening sea? Only the sea-weed red Upon my wild floors spread: The sea-bird fierce and strong That loves the billows' song. Strange, through the murky night, Glitter my storm-birds white: My gulls and petrels flit Above my waste, moonlit. Moonlit, or lightning-rayed:— When strong men pale, afraid, Then all my heart delights, In the mad winter nights. Sweeter than grass to me Is tangle of the sea: The rough brown weed that floats Among the spars of boats. Sweeter than fields of corn The sea-gull's cry forlorn, As on the wave he rests Or rises on its crests. A giant ship is tossed Upon my waves and lost. To-night its course is done: I greet to-morrow's sun. Or, with a laughing smile, I greet some coral-isle. Weary of dripping ghosts, I kiss its golden coasts. In depths that were a grave My crimson sea-fronds wave Most gently. In a rill The star-wort is less still! Then, when night sinks again Upon my boundless plain, I chase the glimmering ships, Foam flashing from my lips. Where all was peace before, My white-maned lions roar: The ships' planks part and crack, And spot their manes with black. II. When first God made me, he Set peace upon the sea. My waters all were calm, Like windless isles of palm. But soon my strength arose; I sprang up from repose: And now two giants fight— God, and the ocean's might. Daily I gain more strength: It may be I at length Shall overwhelm and merge The whole earth in my surge. God's angels shall despair When the tornadoes bear My angels, through the night Glittering,—my sea-birds white: Above the dying ship Fast in the black rock's grip They hover, and they shine, These angel-hosts of mine. Lo! at my mad waves' shriek Blenches the sailor's cheek.— To-night is dark. The shore Will never see him more. His wife may wake and pray, And watch the waste of spray: I thunder to her prayer One answering word—“Despair.” IV. SONG OF THE STARS Across the solemn purple plains of night The starry light Falls in a million gold and silver rays. Within the arch of heaven the star-flowers sing: Yes, these too bring Their ceaseless tribute of deep love and praise. God sowed the fields with daisies—so they say: With many a ray Of golden light he sowed the heavens on high. We are the blossoms of the purple air: We blossom there, The buttercups and cowslips of the sky. One law pervades our being. We arise Upon the skies In sudden fiery light and fervent heat:— Then grass and herbs upon our surface grow, And after lo! The varied countless life we find so sweet. Some stars are tulips of the deep-blue sky, And others vie With snowdrops in their whiteness as they gleam. There are fierce warrior-hosts of ardent stars, Decked out like Mars; But other orbs are gentle as a dream. All are swayed justly by the high God's hand.— Our sea and land Are duly parted, and our living things All render homage unto God who made The sun and shade, And gave the fish its scales, the bird its wings. All, all is good.—The viper in the fen, The worst of men, Can bring to pass the high God's perfect will. No single ray of light from any star Can wander far; Each has some fruitful purpose to fulfil. Storm, thunder, terror, blood-red war, white peace,— Hopes that increase,— Fears that wax strong, or passionate joys that wane,— These all achieve their end: Fierce pain and woe, Sunshine or snow, Thin fields of corn, or leagues of golden grain. On each star at its great appointed hour God sends the power Of some redeeming saviour-soul indeed. All stars shall know in turn a saviour's face, And woman's grace In each to woman's serfdom shall succeed. On one small star that swings in dark-blue air A saviour fair Was born in a far Eastern land, they tell. Great marvellous deeds he did with loving hand In that far land, And lifted souls from sin, and saved from hell. But ah! small star, in regions past thy dream Star-legions gleam; Thy resurrection-tale is also ours. In every star Christ died: in each Christ rose. Each planet knows Its Saviour crowned with thorns,—then crowned with flowers. All stars move slowly towards their destined fate, Small stars and great: Each star was born, and each shall find its tomb. Yes: the Eternal power whom we obey Shall sweep one day All stars and strong suns into lampless gloom Then He, the Eternal power, shall build again The dark night's fane, And fit the dome of heaven with lamps quite new Just as earth's blossoms wither in a night, So all our light Shall pass, and fresh lamps burn against the blue A million, million years are but a day To God, one ray Of wandering sunlight thrown against the dark. And yet the Eternal power shall never lose One white star-rose, One pale moon-petal, or one red sun-spark. The tiniest flower the living God's hand made In the first glade In the first star he flung upon the sky Is living yet in some unknown fair mode In some abode: God hears the hidden violet's faintest sigh. Beyond all highest poets' highest dreams The sweet truth gleams, Gleams out resplendent. Nought can pass away. What God has once inspired with living breath, This knows not death: Sunset predicts another golden day. The sunset of the stars when all things end, This doth portend Another sunrise on the seas of space; Another vision of more stars than ours, And fadeless flowers, And deathless beings of a lordlier race. So, ever, living God, we worship thee. Each galaxy Of moons and suns and stars that veer and change Worships with endless worship at thy shrine: For they are thine, And thou art theirs, in union sweet and strange. II. HUMANITY I. VOICES OF HUMANITY I. CHANT OF POSITIVISTS I. We know our own true home at last: The gorgeous dreams of heaven are past: No angel's harp sounds on the breeze. Gold wings are gone. We mark instead White wings above the dahlia bed, And blue wings o'er the clover leas. These are our angels.—Butterflies, Blue as the cloudless azure skies, Or white-winged as the clouds at morn, Dance o'er the garden-beds, and gleam Above the hedges. Now we dream Of other crowns than that of thorn. This earth is all.—Then add new worth To our one home, our fair old earth: Love every flower in every vale. The fancied flowers of heaven were grand. Yet pause: look round. Stretch out thine hand. Gather that snowdrop pure and pale. Was ever heavenly bloom so white?— Did great stars glitter through the night Of heaven, as on our earth they gleam? Had heaven a million lamps, as we? Or white birds on a dark-blue sea? This is the truth. Heaven was the dream. Heaven was the dream.—But now we know How man is made, where man must go: We seek no opening to the tomb; Content to pass, content to be At rest for all eternity Within the deep and flameless gloom. The flameless gloom—for once hell-fire Roared up to heaven, aye flickered higher Than heavenly towers that rose sublime. If heaven we've lost, we've lost as well The flamelit under-realm of hell: We cannot either sink, or climb. The earth is left.—We can adorn Her beauty,—drape with fields of corn The plains that fill her ample breast. Now heaven has past, our souls are free To love the green earth and the sea: Now hope is dead, we are at rest. II. And woman too is left to love: She brings us dreams of things above The common daily life she scorns. Woman makes all things beautiful; For from the hedge her hand can pull The blossoming rose, and leave the thorns! Our angel stands beside us. She First made man of a certainty Dream of a life beyond the tomb. And, now we seek that life no more, Woman is left us to adore, And woman's worship to resume. The force we wasted on the sky Returns to earth. We put it by; We store it up for better things. The noblest angel after all Is woman: sweeter if she fall At times, for very want of wings! Great were Isaiah, Peter, Paul: Our poets can transcend them all; And, now they sing of earth alone, They'll rise to lordlier heights of song. Yes, man himself shall reach ere long The steps of the Eternal's throne. For that eternal force is ours: It brings forth man, it brings forth flowers And life and death, in it, are one. It shines in stars: in man it lives: Its colour to the rose it gives, And gives its red flame to the sun. One force through all things works its way: Through joy and sorrow, night and day: Is gentle in the blue-bell's breath: Is soft within the snow-flake white: Fierce-hued within the lightning's light: One power speaks “Life,” or whispers “Death.” But all beyond is wrapped in gloom. Nought answers from beyond the tomb: No starlight travels from that sky. No eye can pierce the solemn veil: Each soul exploring comes back pale From contact with eternity. III. Therefore the earth is ours alone: The sun sits on its flame-red throne; The stars sit on their thrones in space;— We have this earth whereon we stand: We have the thrill in woman's hand: We have the love in woman's face. We have the force to win a flower Of love, and wear it for an hour, And for an hour to find it sweet. Aye, sweeter is our love for this— In that there is no second kiss, And even the first is over-fleet. In that to-morrow's frost will slay The violets, passing sweet are they! Life is so short. Let it be grand! Let every deed of man be true: There is no heaven in which to do The noble deeds we only planned. Great peace is ours; a peace beyond The reach of those who hope, despond, And snatch at heaven, and shrink from hell; The peace of those who hope for nought Save what each long day's toil has brought, And, hopeless, feel that all is well. II. CHANT OF CHRISTIANS I. He brought no flowers, he brought no gems, No jewels of earth's diadems; Within a stable he was born. With us he suffered day by day; Upon his brow no gold crown lay, But only mocking points of thorn. Not on divine soft banks of rose Where souls of lovers may repose Rested the Lord of earth and air. He found not where to lay his head; Was cradled where the oxen fed; A rock-tomb was his sepulchre. No gifts of love, or power, or fame, Or earthly rank, were his who came To lift the humble soul on high. Though not one star without him shone, Uncrowned he came, he came alone, He brought no star-wreath from the sky. Though, long before the first star gleamed, Within God's bosom Jesus dreamed, He was content that dream should pass. He entered, here, a woman's womb, And let her sacred flesh entomb All that he felt, all that he was. The maiden's womb by God so blessed Bare Jesus, and the maiden's breast Suckled the living King of kings. The infant Mary brought to birth Was king of heaven, and lord of earth And air, to where the last star swings. This was God's condescension great: To enter by that sacred gate The land of woe, the land of pain. And, having reached this land of ours Where thorn-points peer from fairest flowers, What was the fashion of his reign? He reigned in sinful hearts and weak: The sinner's soul he came to seek; He came to dry the sufferer's tears. He came to tell the worn-out heart, “Be of good cheer. Lo! mine thou art, And shalt be through the endless years.” He came to bid the harlot rise: To pour God's sunlight through her eyes, And bid her dark night wane and flee. He came to bid the whole wide earth Partake with man, a second birth; To soothe to rest the restless sea. He came to bid the waters sink To quiet on the blue lake's brink; To say to wild waves, “Peace. Be still!” He came, that wind-tossed souls might find A haven for the weary mind: He came to do the Father's will. The will of him who sends the rain To touch to green the parched-up plain, Or sends the sun to charm the air: The will of him through whom night's hours Glitter with ceaseless starry flowers That make the boundless dark fields fair. The will of him through whom began The cycle of life that leads to man, And who is Jesus ended all: Making in Jesus man complete; Devising evil's full defeat Through him, and Satan's abject fall. The will obeying which he died Thorn-crowned, a spear thrust through his side And red nails through his feet and hands: The will of God through which he rose And passed into supreme repose, Peace God's Son only understands. II. He came to make the blind eyes see; To show that human will is free; That God's will underlies the whole: That, past all weary winds that roar, Sweet sunlight gilds a golden shore Where harbourage waits the storm-tossed soul. He came and suffered here on earth That man might win the second birth: His spotless flesh and blood he gave That man, partaking, might be fed With heavenly wine and heavenly bread, And, haply, so elude the grave. He healed disease that man might know That pang and torment, throb and throe, Are not to last for ever such; That God, who works in every place Through his own laws of time and space, Can change those strait laws at a touch. God binds the laws. They cannot bind The Lord of nature and mankind. Can God's own star-crown bruise his head? Can God, who made both life and death, Who breathes through dust a living breath, Not raise the righteous from the dead? Can God, who makes the storm arise And hurls the thunders through the skies, Change not, at will, his mode and style? God, who controls the lightning's fire, Can he not change, if he desire, Winter to summer by a smile? Can he not change man's March to May? Weave jessamine in December grey Around his temple-porch at will? Change ice that stiffens into blue Calm water, where the reeds renew Their whispering courtship of the rill? This is what Jesus came to teach: That God's sure hand is over each; That waves may rise, and winds may roar, But God the King is Lord of all,— Nor shall a single sparrow fall From his safe hand for evermore. Our hairs are numbered—so he said: Each bright ray of the sunset red God paints with thoughtful conscious hand. The sunset, be it gold or rose, Just as he wills it, shines and glows,— And every wave he leads to land. Not endless law, but ceaseless will. This is Christ's gospel-message still: Will at the heart of all things made. Not Chance at the world-vessel's helm, But loving Will throughout the realm Of life, eternally obeyed. III. So he who, ere the world began, Was God, became in all points man: God's Son was of a woman born. God took account of woman then, And honoured the sweet slave whom men Have lowered and saddened with their scorn. God honoured woman.—None can say Since that far-off first Christmas-Day That woman hath no share nor part In God's eternal great designs. Woman and man God's thought combines: They dwell together in his heart. So, thus this stormy world of ours Was entered. Christ's hand gathered flowers; He watched the sunset and sunrise: He wandered by the inland sea, The blue calm Lake of Galilee; Earth spread her gifts before his eyes. God, who had made, in epochs long Anterior to the first bird's song, Our fiery bright home spin through space, Appeared, himself, to test the whole:— The unexplored vast cosmic soul Was obvious in a human face. God came himself, his work to try: To test his sunlit dome of sky; To see that all had turned out well. Through Jesus' searching eyes he viewed The desert waste, the green-leafed wood, The rocky height, the watered dell. Through Jesus' eyes he gazed on man: And here he chiefliest found his plan Primordial marred and wrenched awry. Man whom he made divinely free, Ruler of earth, lord of the sea, Was veriest slave beneath the sky. And woman, whom God made so sweet, Was trampled by tyrannic feet: The queen was harlot now, and slave. The love that God designed of old Man's love should win, the women sold; They bartered now what once they gave. So, looking on this world of sin, God saw no hope without, within, Nought left save only, dying here At man's own hands, so to restore Woman—that man's heart might adore; And man—that woman might revere Christ,—having entered by the gate Of birth the world he made so great, He found so small, so dark, so sad,— By one path could return to God: The grim cross pointed out the road, And Jesus saw it, and was glad. By woman Christ was born. Through men He reached his Father's home again, The realm corruption may not see.— When woman's God so longed to save That he assumed the flesh she gave, What was man's answer? Calvary.— III. CHANT OF POETS Sweeter than dreams of moon or star, Or dreams of heaven,—aye, fairer far, The dreams of woman's beauty born! God, when he toiled in heaven alone, Grew weary. Now she shares his throne And brings him rapture, night and morn. What was the whole of heaven most fair Without the love of woman there— Without her eyes, without her look? In heaven the soul of woman grew, And still her eyes retain the blue Of that deep heaven which she forsook. Still something sweet, and something strange, Is in her eyes that gleam and change,— A something not of earth or sky: A something maddening hearts that gaze; Requickening thoughts of ancient days, Dreams of a past eternity. Half angel she—and yet not quite: Woman,—with neck and bosom white; Woman—who gives, gives overmuch. An angel's heart: a woman's frame; She brings us peace; she burns with flame; Destroys a life's work at a touch. Within the sick-room dark and dread The glory of her golden head Brings sunlight. Nigh the grave she stands; And man forgets the flowers they bring In gazing at that sweeter thing, The heavenly lilies of her hands. Yet passion fierce and passion strong She wakes. She thrills all hearts to song: She crowns the poet with the bays. In dreams of her his life goes by; Her glances fill with stars his sky, And fill with thoughts of fire his days. God made her soul. Then Satan took The sweet thing and he changed her look And set some light of evil there. She who was wholly angel then Is half a temptress now to men; Aye, half a fiend, and wholly fair. But wholly fair,—for ever fair.— The mere slight fragrance of her hair, The least soft thrilling of her hands, Has served ere now, again will serve, To make the course of history swerve, And ruin souls, and ruin lands. Aye, God and Satan well may fight! She is so sweet, she is so white; She is so good to touch and hold. Love is the only thing that well May outlive heaven and outlive hell: This one joy never groweth old. Still fresh as in the early day When Eden heard the first rose say, “A sweeter mouth than mine is born,” She treads the earth. Since time began She has given herself away to man, With rapture half, and half in scorn. The magic in her voice and gaze Is still the same as in old days When Eden found her very fair. Till time itself shall change and die Some marvel past man's speech shall lie Within the sweetness of her hair. The sympathizing world has worn On its own brow Christ's crown of thorn For nigh two thousand years to-day: But, ages ere he lived and died, Woman could lure man to her side; Her mouth could melt man's will away. A mere girl's eyes of hare-bell blue Can thrill a strong man through and through Whom Jove's own thunders would not bend. And man will win a world, and this In turn will barter for a kiss: And so it will be to the end. IV. CHANT OF WOMEN I. Man brings us flowers and brings us grief; He twines for us love's myrtle leaf, And wreathes about our brows the thorn. We crave for love? Man gives us this? Nay, he bestows but passion's kiss, And tinges passion with his scorn! Ten thousand years have passed away, Or more years yet, the wise men say, Since history on this earth began. In all those years, what have we gained? Deceived, misunderstood, disdained, What shall we render back to man? Love.—This our great prerogative, Eternally we gain and give: We bring God's sunlight from on high. The earth was dark until we came; We fill the earth with love's bright flame, And steal the gold dawn from the sky. By love we grow; by love we gain The right to live, the right to reign:— When man's wild wayward course is done We then shall say to man: Behold, While thine hand delved amid the mould Our souls caught glory from the sun! While thou wast watching earth with eyes Most dim, we watched God in the skies With gaze that daily grew more clear. To conquer earth was all thy dream: To build thy mills on every stream; Through unconjectured waves to steer! Where once were fields made bright with flowers Grew grimy towns and sullen towers: By river-banks great wharfs arose. Where once were alder green and oak Black factories loom, and chimneys smoke, And engines break the morn's repose. O maker of all hideous things, 'Twas well God sent us without wings To dwell upon thine earth with thee— Else, long ere this, our souls had fled Beyond the waste of sunset red, Beyond the green-blue waste of sea: Else some remembrance of our home Had lured us forth to soar and roam Through silent leagues of star-sown air, Compelling us to search for flowers In airy fields and heavenly bowers, Man having stripped earth's meadows bare! II. How couldst thou, having hid with steam And smoke the skies where sweet stars gleam, Discern the starlight in our look? How couldst thou, having choked all flowers In fields and woodlands, care for ours? What cares the boulder for the brook? Thou, slave of thine electric light, Hast even invoked perennial night To brood above thy city's spires; Lest one vast arrow of the sun Should pierce the fog, and leave not one Unquenched, of thine ephemeral fires! But we, who dreamed of higher things, Were happy where the brown lark sings Above the fields of golden grain. At peace with God, we saw the showers Rejoice the pale sun-stricken flowers, And blessed God for his bounteous rain. The poor fish panting out of reach Of the cool water, on the beach, With death's hues glittering on his side, Him would we save: him back we threw, And, smiling, saw the water blue Receive him safe.—You would deride. What pity for the tortured horse Has man? He goads him on his course: There is no mercy in his soul.— God, when he made the dumb things, erred. If he had let them speak one word, Just to repudiate man's control! And God, who made our womanhood And made it at the outset good, Erred too, in that he made us weak. The strength was man's: the soul was ours. God should have guarded his pale flowers In heaven, and let man come to seek. And yet...God hardly could have known That man would claim us for his own; Would hound the thought of God away: Would change the form God made so sweet Into the harlot of the street; Teach those to curse, who once could pray. Ah, piteous story of our wrongs!— And yet to God the whole belongs: We give to God and Christ the whole. We trust God, till all sufferings end: We have in Christ a deathless Friend, An helper sweet, a kindred soul. Christ by his perfect womanhood Hath power to make all women good: The fallen to lift, the sad to save. Women who met his glances knew That here at last was manhood true: Fearless, to him their hearts they gave. They called him “God;” for God was here. The Godhood in a man makes dear The man to woman. Woman's kiss Is never given as mankind deems, Absorbed in its own narrow dreams. God in man—woman worships this. Not all the flowers man brings to her Make her forget Christ's sepulchre. She whispers, “Lord, remember me!” In every crown her brow has worn Woman in secret plants a thorn, In homage to Gethsemane. II. BALLADS OF HUMAN LIFE I. I. BLUE-BELLS “One day, one day, I'll climb that distant hill And pick the blue-bells there!” So dreamed the child who lived beside the rill And breathed the lowland air. “One day, one day, when I am old I'll go And climb the mountain where the blue-bells blow!” One day! One day! The child was now a maid, A girl with laughing look; She and her lover sought the valley-glade Where sang the silver brook. “One day,” she said, “love, you and I will go And reach that far hill where the blue-bells blow!” Years passed. A woman now with wearier eyes Gazed towards that sunlit hill. Tall children clustered round her. How time flies! The blue-bells blossomed still. She'll never gather them! All dreams fade so. We live and die, and still the blue-bells blow. II. THE TOURNAMENT The trumpets' blare Rings through the air: The glittering lists are bright with sword and shield. A hundred gallant knights, Known in a thousand fights, Mix and engage upon the mimic field. But one towers o'er them all, A noble knight and tall, With giant form in armour black concealed. In vain, in vain, The thick blows rain,— He dreams of her whose heart has wrought him wrong. With little heed of all, He lets the swift strokes fall: His war-horse steers a way with onset strong. He gazes up above: Where is his lady-love? He marks her not amid the courtly throng. And yet at last, When hope was past, Flashed on his eyes the wondrous eyes he sought. She wore his colours too, White, twined with tender blue— “She loves!” His strength rushed on him at the thought. Then knight on knight fell low: Aye, always it is so! By woman's hand a true knight's sword is wrought. III. CHRISTMAS FAIRIES Ah! dear old Christmas-tides of long ago. Around the creaking roof-tops roared the blast: The streets and hills and fields were draped in snow; Across the ice the glittering skates shot past. Youth was not dead! Bright green and red The holly-leaves and holly-berries gleamed. The merry church-bells rang; Our young hearts laughed and sang; Of joyous years to come our spirits dreamed. But years to come bring trouble and despair. If childhood brings its simple dream of joy Youth brings love's holier dream, a dream more fair Than dreams which haunt the bright heart of the boy. But all dreams melt As soon as felt,— They fade into the mist of things unseen. Youth's dream of love, alas! Must likewise pale and pass: Sweet love must be as if it had not been. And yet—the holly-berries still are bright; The bells chime merrily across the snow: A thousand Christmas-trees will give delight, Green as the Christmas-trees of long ago. Why are we sad? The young are glad; They dance around the fir-tree hand in hand. Outside, white miles of snow: Inside, the red fire's glow And children's smiles and dreams of fairy-land. IV. TWO NIGHTS Last night he kissed my hair, and kissed my face, And laughed, and praised my figure's supple grace. My soul was dazzled as with sudden flame: Star behind star my sweet star-bridesmaids came: To-night, to-night, No soft starlight, But gloom profound that veils the heaven and sea. Last night the world was full of light and fire: Star throbbed to star, and burned with sweet desire There was no heaven—for earth was heaven instead! No immortality,—for death was dead! To-night, to-night, Dead is delight, And pain awakes and lives eternally. Last night I thought before God's throne I stood And knew, knew once for all, that God was good. To-night how vast a darkness clothes me round: I madden for love's footfall. Not a sound!— Last night, last night, My love took flight: Cloud sobs to cloud, and whispers, “Where is he?” V. LOVE'S ETERNITY Love's early honey-moon is passing sweet. The enraptured lovers wander hand in hand Through the wild roses and the golden wheat, And passion's glamour clothes the sea and land. Her eyes outvie The starlit sky: Love is so full of light that nought else gleams. Love would give light, Were the world black as night! Love would create its heaven of stars and dreams! Then come maturer days. Glad children glance— Upon the tree of life love's blossoms blow. And yet some element of old romance Has vanished, melted in the long ago! The husband says, “Think of the days When hand in hand we wandered, you and I; The nights of June; The marvel of the moon: In later days must love's old glory die?” But with the voice that charmed his heart of old And made the whole of life one moonlit dream The true wife answers, “Life's tale is not told: In front of us new starlit skies will gleam. When toil is o'er, Love as before Will find us, sweetheart, claim us for his own. Love's autumn day, Aye! though our hair be grey, Shall match the sweetness of our summer flown.” VI. MIDNIGHT AT THE HELM “What see'st thou, friend? The frail masts bend, Thy ship reels wildly on the tossing deep; Thy fearless eyes Regard the skies And this broad waste wherethrough white chargers leap; See'st thou the foam?”Pilot.—“I see my home, And children on a white soft couch asleep.” “What see'st thou, friend? The tiller-end Thou graspest safely in thy firm strong grip; Thine eyes are strange, They seem to range Beyond sea, sky, and cloud, and struggling ship, Beyond the foam.”Pilot.— “I see my home,— Brown cottage-eaves round which the swallows dip.” “What see'st thou, friend? Black leagues extend On all sides round about thy bark and thee; Not one star-speck Above the deck Abates the darkness of the midnight sea; The waves' throats roar—”Pilot.—“I see the shore, And eyes that plead with God for mine and me.” VII. THE GHOST AT THE WHEEL Off Beachy Head the vessel wrestles hard: In vain the captain's eyes would pierce the gloom. The great grim cliffs, foam-belted, iron-barred, Through the wild wreaths of scudding sea-fog loom. No stars shine out. Put helm about? Nay! this one ship will hold her lonely way! Though death be near, Her captain's deaf to fear: His voice out-thunders wind and hissing spray. Yet at the rudder, see this lurid light! A form takes shape amid the wind and spray: A white face glitters through the jet-black night. Why falls the captain on his knees to pray? His brother's form Shines through the storm, His brother drowned where these same mad waves flow Round Beachy Head: The strong man shakes in dread: When dead men steer, where will the doomed ship go? The dead man steered. The labouring ship veered round. The awe-struck sailors watched without a word. The waves and threatening thunder ceased to sound: You might have caught the carol of a bird. Then slowly grew The sky pale-blue; Morn showed that when the spectre took command, Ten yards away Were deadly reefs and spray: Love outlasts death, and aids with living hand. VIII. THE SENTRY Along his path the sentry paces slow; Above the field of battle soars the moon: The night is silent, save for wailing low Of wounded men who will be silent soon. The sentry stands With ready hands And eyes that peer far out into the gloom. The hostile hosts, Like groups of ghosts, Upon the distant shadowy hill-tops loom. But not on these the soldier's gaze is set; His heart is gazing elsewhere than his eyes. He sees a garden sweet with mignonette; He hears a voice that to his own replies. O'er leagues of sea In thought flies he; He stands beside a window wreathed with rose. Sweet eyes of blue, Pure, soft, and true, Gaze in his own, till his heart overflows. Ha! guns flash out. The dream is over then. The vision vanishes. It melts away. Lo! plumes, and neighing steeds, and throngs of men, And rattling rifles, in the morning grey. No cottage door— Mad guns that roar! No tender glance from maiden's loving eyes. Yet pity not A soldier's lot: He well has loved, who for his country dies. IX. THE ENGINE DRIVER Through sleet and snow The wild wheels go: Across waste wolds with purple heather bright, O'er many a bridge, Through tunnelled ridge, Flinging weird fires along the startled night, The engine flies,— And one man's steady eyes And hands must guide the thundering force aright. What trust we place In that one face, In those stern lips and dauntless hands that steer: Bridegroom and bride Sit side by side, And trust their lives to him without a fear. Through sun and snow The flashing wild wheels go: He guides those flashing wheels from year to year. Through storm and sun The wild wheels run; Blue skies o'erhead, or murky midnight gloom: Through summer showers, Past woodbine—bowers, Past steep banks yellowed with soft primrose-bloom. Yet one man's skill Makes the end good or ill: He holds the keys of pleasure—or the tomb! X. ON THE RAMPARTS The gold sun sets above the solemn sands; The strained sight aches across the yellow sea: In front, around, the solitude expands, Grim, terrible, devoid of flower or tree. The waste seems dead; No line of red Upon the horizon brings the city cheer. Fierce foes surround; Their trumpets sound; No answering English bugle-note rings clear. Upon the ramparts lo! one paces slow; From time to time he gazes o'er the sands: If morning brings not help, all hope must go. He lifts to silent heaven strong urgent hands. Is help not nigh, O starlit sky And Eastern moon whose white orb glitters past? Black looms the night. No help in sight! Must the beleaguered city fall at last? Morning! The thin mist rises in the air: Not yet the great sun flashes from the sky. That grim and silent watcher still is there. To-day must bring relief, or all must die. Gaze once again Across the plain: One last wild look, for now the sun shines clear. Ha! bayonets gleam; It is no dream; Our England's help can reach us even here! XI. THE EXPLORER Through forests deep, Where serpents creep, The fearless strong explorer threads his way: 'Neath tropic moons, Past dim lagoons, Depths where the sun can never send a ray. His life is in his hand: He treads the burning sand: His labour ceases not from day to day. And yet at night His soul takes flight: He seeks another country in his dreams. He wanders through Lanes fresh with dew And cornfields where the scarlet poppy gleams. He sees the spotted trout From the dark bank flash out: He sees green willows fringing English streams. At morn he wakes: His road he takes:— Upon mud-banks vast crocodiles repose. The trout's quick gleam Was but a dream: The poppy was a dream, a dream the rose! Yet England's viewless might, Stretching through day and night, Follows wherever English valour goes. XII. THE BURNING SHIP The transport ship pursues its lonely way Across the purple moonlit Indian deep. Above, the stars shine out with tender ray: The waveless far-spread ocean seems asleep. All, all was well, When evening fell, And well at sunrise all shall surely be. There's nought to fear! Steer, keen-eyed helmsman, steer,— Steer the great ship across the silent sea! But ah! what piteous sudden cry rings out? “Fire!”—“Fire!” again.—Oh, can this dread thing be? Yes, once again the wild heart-rending shout Troubles the bosom of the peaceful sea. “Fire!”—Red flames rise And stain the skies: The fire spreads o'er the sails, and licks the mast. The ship's consumed! The passengers are doomed: Each agonizing moment seems their last. But ah! the steady soldiers form in lines: Athwart the fire the regiment's old flag floats. The fire upon men's fearless faces shines: The sailors pass the women to the boats. The boats recede; Wild eyes give heed— Their death-watch on the deck the soldiers keep. One strange last cheer, Which England's heart shall hear— And then the sun rose on a sail-less deep. II. I. THE SONG OF ABOU KLEA Our English manhood's still the same As in the days of Waterloo; The sons uphold their father's fame, Beneath strange skies of burning blue. The race is growing old, some say, And half worn out and past its prime; But English rifles volley “Nay,” And English manhood conquers time. Then fear not, and veer not From duty's narrow way: What men have done, can still be done, And shall be done to-day! The broad wild desert stretched away For many and many a weary league; Our soldiers suffered day by day, Enduring hunger, thirst, fatigue. But still, when their fierce foes they met, They fought and conquered as of old: The sun of England has not set; Our nation's story is not told. Then blench not, and quench not High hope's glad golden ray: What men have done, can still be done, And shall be done to-day! II. ENGLAND HO! FOR ENGLAND A FEDERATION SONG Old England needs her children, She needs them every one, From India's morning-bugle To the last sunset-gun: North, East, and South, she needs them, And in the furthest West, And where the Channel waters Storm round her rocky breast. The day is surely coming When all alike she'll need, All far-off true descendants Of the old island-breed. The day is surely coming When all may have to strike For England, ho! for England— So all must fare alike! “For England, ho! for England”— The great deep-throated cry Rings far across the waters; A million mouths reply, “For England, ho! for England, Till England's work be done,— And England's work is timeless And measured by the sun.” III. THE WORKMAN-KING I'm only a working man, my boys, I toil in the London smoke, But when a holiday comes, my boys, I cease to grind and choke. The garden of England's mine, my boys, Its valleys and woods and plains, For the people rules the whole, my boys, The people votes and reigns! The democrat rules the whole, my boys, The forests of larch and oak; We never need cough and sniff, my boys, In the great towns' soot and smoke. The heather-bud swells on the moors and fells And the sea is blue and wide; Do you know how sweet the country smells? You never can tell till you've tried! A noble heritage this, my boys, To possess and rule and sway! Now the people votes and reigns, my boys, We speak, and our lords obey. The garden of England's ours, my boys, But to rule ourselves remains, For the man who governs and rules himself Is ever the man who reigns— The man who can govern and rule himself Is ever the king who reigns! IV. RETROSPECT “O conquering poet, thou that hast The whole world at thy feet, What laurel-garlands crown thy past! Is not the present sweet? Poet. “I'd fling away my crown of bay, Lose it without one throe, To feel beside my own to-day The tender heart I flung away Long, long ago! “O statesman, thou that guidest things With godlike strength of will, Thou art more regal than earth's kings; They hear thee, and are still.” Statesman. “I shape the world continually, I lay its monarchs low, And yet I'd give the world to see The dead eyes smile that smiled at me Long, long ago!” “O warrior, thou that carriest high Thy grey victorious head, What pæans echo to the sky At thy war-horse's tread!” Warrior. “I heed them not. I long to hear The child's speech, soft and slow, That used to sound upon mine ear, So sweet, so pure, so silver-clear, Many and many and many a year Ago!” V. TWO NESTS In the leafless sycamore Lo! a winter nest. Round it all the ceaseless roar Of the storm's unrest. Here love's palace once was seen Swinging to the breeze, Roofed and guarded by the green, Full of melodies. Here the sunset loved to rest, Smiling on the thrush's nest. In yon London attic room Once a painter wrought; All our dense November gloom Darkened not his thought. Woman's love was here as well; Woman's loving eyes Met the painter's when they fell From the pictured skies. Love forsook his fiery quest, Pausing at the painter's nest. Both are changed alike to-day. When the thrushes flew, Sorrow turned the green leaves grey, Robbed the heaven of blue. Painter, sweetheart, both are dead, But the room remains, And an easel smeared with red,— Dusty window panes. Death destroys with equal zest Painter's bower, or thrush's nest. VI. THE PATHWAY OF LIFE In every heart a story; In every heart a grief; The sorrow of a lifetime; A pain or rapture brief. Old hearts and young together, All hearts alike, are one; All harden in black weather, All soften at the sun. All hearts have had their burden; Romance has come to most, Has entered life with trumpets And vanished like a ghost. Each heart is like an album With blossoms therein dried; Sweet blossoms, pure love-blossoms, That bloomed a day, then died. Oh! brothers, Oh! strong brothers, And sisters sad and sweet, Wives, daughters, fathers, mothers,— In suffering all can meet. The path of pain in common We all alike have trod,— May that one pathway lead us, Lead all alike to God! VII. THE PILOT'S WIFE “The moon shines out with here and there a star, But furious cloud-ranks storm both stars and moon: The mad sea drums upon the harbour-bar; Will the tide slacken soon? O Sea that took'st my youngest, wilt thou spare?” —And the Sea answered through the black night-air, “I took thy youngest. Shall I spare to-night?” “The thundering breakers sweep and slash the sands; To westward lo! one line of cream-white foam: I raise to darkling heaven my helpless hands; I watch within the home. O Sea that took'st my eldest, wilt thou save?” —And the Sea answered as from out a grave, “I slew thine eldest son for my delight.” “The giant waves plunge o'er the shingly beach; The tawny-maned great lions of the sea With pitiless roar howl down all human speech; Is God far-off from me? O Sea that slewest my sons, mine husband spare!” —The Sea's wild laughter shook and rent the air: Lo! on the beach a drowned face deadly white. VIII. THE DEAD CHILD But yesterday she played with childish things, With toys and painted fruit. To-day she may be speeding on bright wings Beyond the stars! We ask. The stars are mute. But yesterday her doll was all in all; She laughed and was content. To-day she will not answer, if we call: She dropped no toys to show the road she went. But yesterday she smiled and ranged with art Her playthings on the bed. To-day and yesterday are leagues apart! She will not smile to-day, for she is dead. IX. THE SHADOW AT THE DOOR What adds a beauty to the rose? The thought that, when the night-wind blows, The petals white or petals pink At his cold touch may fail and shrink. This gives its beauty to the flower— That it but blooms and lives one hour. The sun gives charm. What gives it more? The Shadow waiting at the door. The sweetest hour may swiftly pass: Brown are these blades, that once were grass. Blue eyes, gold hair, they are but shows; Death takes them, as it takes the rose. Love draws such eager passionate breath Because he's followed fast by death. What makes us value Love's kiss more? The deathlike Shadow at the door. O love, our bower of love is sweet; The white rug nestles round your feet. Your brown eyes watch the bright fire's glow; I watch your eyes. I love them so! The pictures watch us from the wall: I'm king, and you the queen of all. Does aught else watch? Aye, one thing more: That ghostlike Shadow at the door! X. SADNESS AND GLADNESS Our tired hearts gather sadness, as we grow In care and thoughts and pain. The sweet spring sunlight that once charmed us so Will never gleam again. The grey mists thicken as the sun declines: A deepening shadow clothes the mountain pines. But our tired heart sees not the whole of things. Still over the brown stream Flashes the kingfisher with rapid wings, One sudden azure gleam. Because our souls are weary or are sad, We quite forget that half the world is glad! Some lover just has won his lady's smile, As we won long ago: The wild hedge-blossoms cluster by the stile, Gold buttercups a-row: The silvery minnow darts along the stream: Life is not all a trouble or a dream. XI. NEAR AT HAND The dead are with us through our nights and days; They have not journeyed far, Beyond the clouds, beyond the golden haze That shrouds the furthest star. Our earthly flowers Are still to them most dear, And still they hear The songs of merry birds in hawthorn bowers. Friends who have passed are never far away, Beyond the warmth of June, Beyond the sights and sounds and scents of May, Beyond our waters' tune. They linger still To watch the white moon rise Behind the hill, And still take pleasure in the sunlit skies. They nearest are, just when we need them most. They help with living hands; No spectral shape, no fruitless pallid ghost, Peers from the unseen lands. They watch and heed; Their legions fill the air; They never speed Beyond the cry of pain, or reach of prayer. XII. LOVE AND DEATH An angel watched the world rejoicing: The flowers sang in the morning light; The blue sea sang its tender love-song To golden-girdled stars at night. All seemed so full of peace and gladness— Till lo! a sudden ice-cold breath Passed over hill and wave and meadow: A stern voice whispered, “I am Death!” Alas! in all that angel's dreaming His loving heart had never dreamed That only for one single moment The fairy blossoms sang and gleamed. He turned, and in despairing sadness Would have resought the heavens above, When, softly sounding through the shadows, A sweet voice whispered, “I am Love!” And then the angel saw that fairer Than heaven with all its strifeless calm Is earth, for Love makes sorrow lovely, And plucks from grief the victor's palm. Aye, Love with its undying sweetness Can soothe the weary, cheer the lone: If Death's voice threatens through the darkness, Love whispers, “Death is overthrown!” III. LYRICS OF LOVE AND PASSION I. COCK MILL Upon the bridge beside the mill Two lovers paused, and watched the stream: The golden autumn woods were still With all the stillness of a dream. They gazed into each other's eyes; They loved—they felt that life was sweet; So still the woods, so calm the skies, They almost heard their own hearts beat, While flowing, ever flowing, The clear stream sought the sea, As love-sweet moments going Mix with eternity. Beside that grey old Yorkshire mill A hundred hearts have paused to dream: Have watched the shadows on the hill, And watched the foam-bells on the stream. And all have found the present fair,— Have found the future—who can say? But still that same old mill stands there, And still the stream goes day by day Flowing, for ever flowing, Bearing dead hopes along Like dead leaves, all unknowing, And changing not its song. And in the future hundreds more Will pause and watch the rippling stream, And hope as others hoped of yore, And dream as dead hearts used to dream. A sadness hangs about the mill And broods above the waters' flow; So many hearts must now be still Who watched those bright waves long ago,— Those bright waves ever flowing, Singing to hill and sky, “Seize each love-moment going, For even love must die!” II. A LOST LOVE I would have died to win her: I loved her past a dream. Ah! hand in hand we wandered Beside the mountain-stream. I kissed her raven tresses: I kissed her gentle hand: I was the proudest lover In all the wide wide land. But ah! the rich man sought her; He bribed her with his gold. He changed her heart. He bought her. Her love for me grew cold. And now my life is over— In vain the sun may rise; I never loved the sunshine, I only loved her eyes! Ah! my lost love, my darling, Will your heart one day see That when you won your heaven You purchased hell for me? Ah! my lost love, my beauty, His soul is fierce and mean. He loves you like a plaything: I loved you like a queen! III. A SUMMER DAY The broad blue sky above me, The sunshine on the corn (Oh, had I you to love me, This perfect August morn!) Green tall trees overslanting, With sunlight flashing through (And yet one thing was wanting; My heart cried out for you!) Oh, were you with me, darling, This perfect summer day, Its glory were completer Than tongue of man might say. The green trees of the forest, The bright flowers of the dell, All longed for you, my darling; And oh, I longed as well! And then the eve came slowly: Soft moonlight glittered down With tender light and holy Upon the seaside town. (Oh, were you only with me, All longing, love, would cease: The day that dawned in sadness Would close its eyes in peace!) IV. THE DANCE Weary I am this winter night, Sleep presses on my brain; But you will dance till morning light Gleams at the window-pane. Yes, you will dance, while I shall sleep— So it must ever be! This winter night is starry-bright For you, but dark for me. Yes, you will dance, while I must sleep, And many a heart will thrill As through the dance your Spanish glance Flashes its magic still. Yes, you will dance, while I shall rest, And so it ought to be; For you the night, ablaze with light! The lampless dark for me! And ah! I read the lesson through; I read and grasp it all. The day may come when sleep more deep May on my spirit fall. I shall be sleeping very sound And very still, maybe, While life is yet one merry round Of dance and song for thee. V. “WILT THOU REMEMBER?” Dost thou remember me? It matters not! My heart revisits every spot Which, sweetheart, we have trodden together In this blue perfect summer weather. Dost thou remember me? Wilt thou forget? Mine is the deep regret; Mine is the undying pain. It sometimes seems That love comes only in dreams! Wilt thou remember? Will thy girl's heart keep Treasured in store-house safe and deep, Soft memories of the days soon-dying Before love's laughter changed to sighing? Wilt thou remember? Must it only be That I shall think on thee? Ah! through my heart shoots swift an arrowy pain.. We shall not meet again! VI. FOR EVER YOUNG The wild world hastens on its way; The grey-haired century nears its close; Its sorrow deepens day by day; The summer blush forsakes the rose. But, darling, while your voice I hear And while your dark-brown eyes I see Sad months and sunless, seasons drear, Are all the same, all glad, to me. Despair can never reach me While your soft hand I hold: While your eyes love and teach me, I never shall grow old! They say that love forsakes the old; That passion pales and fades away; That even love's bright locks of gold Must lose their charm and change to grey. But, darling, while your heart is mine And while I feel that you are true For me the skies will ever shine With summer light, and tenderest blue. Yes, let old age deride me! I scorn his mocking tongue. Dear love, with you beside me, I am for ever young! VII. AUTUMNAL LOVE Fair is love whose footstep wanders 'Mid the sunny meads of spring; Love that smiles and laughs and ponders While the swallow's on the wing; Fair and tender, Full of splendour, Full of thoughts the roses bring —Full of dreams the roses bring. Sweet is love when fervent summer Fills the fields with flowers and fruit; When strong passion, swift-winged comer, Wakes wild echoes with his lute; Songs of sweeter Note and metre Make spring's softest music mute —Make spring's sweetest music mute. Yet life's autumn brought my treasure. I was sad and tired and old, Worn and weary beyond measure, When thy face I did behold: Sweet love found me, Saved and crowned me, When the corn was turning gold —When the corn was turning gold. VIII. “GIVE ME THAT ROSE!” Give me that rose! It rests, it blows, Next to your heart, my sweet. That flower to which such favour has been shown Amid Song's deathless flowers shall win a throne From which to watch the baffled years retreat; Give me that rose! Give me that rose: Our moment goes; What now might chance, again may never be! If I have loved you with a love supreme, For just one wild mad moment let me dream (And die within the dream) that you love me! Give me the rose! IX. A TUFT OF MEADOW-SWEET A tuft of withered meadow-sweet, Just that and nothing more: And yet what hosts of memories fleet The dry old fronds restore! A tuft of withered meadow-sweet, No gaudy pink or rose; And yet the dried-up leaves I see, Long scorned of butterfly and bee, Are holier, dearer, unto me Than any flower that blows— Than any flower that blows, my love, Than any flower that blows! For once—ah heaven! how long ago— You have forgotten quite— Where over the blue waters' flow Wild sea-birds' wings shine white, You picked a tuft of meadow-sweet (This very tuft I hold): You plucked the flower and quite forgot The flower, the scene, the youth, the spot; You chose to share another's lot, And share another's gold; You scorned the flower, but I did not, And do not, though I'm old! X. A HEART IN ARMOUR I show the world my armour, All marred and bent with blows. Let men complain!—I never deign My true thoughts to disclose. I show the world my armour, Clinched close in every part. To you I show my weakness: To you I show my heart. I show my strength to others; My tenderness to thee: An ironbound rock I stand the shock Of life's tempestuous sea. But at thy touch, my darling, All hardness melts away; Tears stain my cheek, if you but speak, And lo! the rock can pray. How little mankind knows me! All chained and barred in steel They find my heart. Then they depart, And think I cannot feel. Yet heights and heart-depths hazy Are sometimes clear to one: The sun's one favourite daisy Can understand the sun! XI. AT REST Your dark eyes win a glory From every passing day; The longer grows love's story, The sweeter 'tis, I say! We conquer Time together; For every flower we've seen Has passed into our kingdom, And made you ten times Queen! We win the wealth of summers; We rob the winter days; You're Queen in your fur tippet, Queen of the fireside blaze. Strong love defies all weather: While you and I are one, While we walk on together, We always see the sun! More beautiful and holy You are to me, my Queen: Life's vistas lengthen slowly, And scene melts into scene. But life's old strange heart-hunger Has ceased—I am at rest: And daily you grow younger, And I more deeply blest. XII. LOVE THE CONQUEROR O love, if life should end to-night, How short our life would seem! One little flash of summer light; One brief and passionate dream; One glimpse of roses on the wall, Or blue-bells in the lane, Then, love, the end, the end of all— Aye, buds might swell, and leaves might fall, But not for us again! The stream we used to watch and love Would ever onward flow; From the dark pines the grey wood-dove Would call—we should not know. Ah! not for us the pines would wave, For us no stream would run; We should be silent in the grave, Unable even to hoard and save One little glimpse of sun. Yet is not this a sombre view Of life and all it brings? Thank heaven, the bright waves still are blue, And still the throstle sings! And oh, before love's conquering song Death's voice sinks quite away; For life is short, but love is long, And death is fierce, but love is strong, And love shall win the day! XIII. “MY ALL!” Thou art my all! The golden sun Runs on its course by day, Till sombre clouds and vapours dun Fold round its chariot gay: Yet without thee the world were dark, The sun would never shine; It would be just a wandering spark, Were not thy hand in mine! Yea, even the golden sun above Owes all its glory to thy love. Thou art my all! The flowers are fair When summer comes to reign: But bind the sweet buds in thy hair; What sweetness new they gain! The rose is rich, the lily white, Yet sweeter each one grows For soft communion with thy bright Soft mouth, that richer rose. Thou art indeed the loveliest thing That passionate summer steals from spring. Thou art my all upon this earth; And thou wilt surely be My all, when heavenly stars shine forth On heavenly shores and sea. My all on earth, my all in heaven, My earthly summer's rose, My perfect flower in that strange hour When earthly summers close— My light on earth, be still, sweet soul, My light when life has reached its goal. XIV. “LOVERS STILL!” From lands where Love for ever dreams Thy soft eyes took their light; No moon with quite such magic gleams, Nor any star by night. There is a light that from the soul Flows forth, and that is thine; The only light that can control So wild a heart as mine! Thou bindest all my heart in chains, Sweet chains, as sweet as strong; Love sometimes for one moment reigns, But thou hast reigned so long! In truth I now begin to see That we shall never part, But that God's vast eternity Will link us, heart to heart. The thought is strange and solemn, love, Yet sweeter than 'tis strange: Grand is the love time cannot move And life's cares cannot change. Love me with changeless love like this— Then let time work its will, It cannot steal or mar our bliss If we be lovers still! XV. “AH! ONCE I THOUGHT I LOVED THE ROSE” Ah! once I thought I loved the rose And once I loved the sky, Its calm yet passionate repose, Its blue eternity,— But now I love thy lips and eyes, Thy beauty I adore, I worshipped flowers and summer skies But thee I worship more. I know not whether love is pain: It sometimes brings despair: Then blooms the summer rose in vain; In vain it scents the air. If thou dost wrap my soul in doubt And bid bright hope fly far, Though all night's countless stars shine out I never see one star. And yet with pain I would not part, Not even with despair, If only I may win thine heart And find my solace there. A thousand faces meet my eyes, And yet I see but one,— As silent leagues of starlit skies Dream only of the sun. XVI. “WHY SEEK FOR LOVE BEYOND THE SKY?” Why seek for love beyond the sky, In stars that swim through space? Behold! sweet love is very nigh, And very close his face. On purple fells, by forest-wells, By our blue ocean's side, Love lives and smiles, and dreams and dwells; He lords it far and wide. Not in the shining distant space Where faint star-clusters gleam Does Love reveal his sovereign face,— Nay, here he loves to dream. Our dim old earth can hear his mirth Through forest-arches ring; Aye, English lake and Scottish firth Have heard Love's red lips sing! But most of all, O love of mine, Does Love reveal through thee His look superb, his touch divine, His matchless sovereignty. All stars may die in depths of sky, All dreams fade even as flowers, Earth will be heaven if thou art nigh: Why search, when heaven is ours? NOCTURNE SLEEP I. Not for joy and fiery pleasure Would our spirits ask: Weary past all mortal measure With our ceaseless task, All too weary even to weep, All our inmost grief confessed, All we ask is rest and sleep, Sleep and rest. Surely, if the world-wide nations, If these spake as one, Endless sorrowing generations, All beneath the sun, North and South and East and West, All alike in anguish deep, All would yearn for sleep and rest, Rest and sleep. Lovers who loved on undaunted, Till they met Despair: Poets, dreamers, ever haunted By the spectre Care; If the truth be told indeed, One prayer throbs through every breast— “Give our weary souls for meed Sleep and rest.” II. In the far-off heavenly places Lo! God hears man's cry Piercing through the starry spaces And the untroubled sky. To the sufferer's restless pillow, To the sailor tossing on the deep, To the weary sea-bird on the billow, God to all his creatures sendeth sleep. When the golden sun is banished At the word of night, When the glare of day has vanished, With reposeful light Gleam the stars upon the ocean, Soothing all the hearts and eyes that weep: Rest succeeds to daylight's fierce emotion. Even the murderer God can rock to sleep. Even the soul, whom on the morrow The black gibbet waits, God can visit in his sorrow. Through the prison-gates Passing unopposed and fearless God can touch his eyes with slumber's wing; Make that one last sleep most sweet and tearless; Wander with him through the fields of Spring. III. To the lark that nestles 'mid the clover, After daylong worship of the sun; To the brown thrush when his song is over, To the swallow when his flight is done; To the eagle on his eyrie, To the robin in his nest, When the wings of each grow weary, God sends rest. To the happy bride and bridegroom lying In the first long love-sleep side by side; To the aged, when life's hopes seem dying And when death is longed for like a bride; To the heart of Summer darkening Slowly at the Autumn's breath, God, from his far blue skies hearkening, Sends his angels, Sleep and Death. To the heart that starts with happy dreaming, When the first long days of summer shine; To the soul that sees the red sun gleaming Through the autumnal groves of larch and pine; To the heart of Winter wailing, When no corn is left to reap, God with tenderness unfailing Sends twin angels, Death and Sleep. IV. Grey-grown nations, when they weary, When their course is run; When their shortening days grow dreary For the lack of sun; Hebrew, Roman, Carthaginian, Syrian, Grecian, when their day is past, God removes to Death's dominion; Even the longest record ends at last. As the sacred night descending Covers all the sky, Its vast purple robe extending Downward from on high, So the night of time has swallowed Endless nations, cities, one by one. Greece passed first, the Roman followed. England too will pass beyond the sun. All the towns that press and hustle In the modern maze: London with its stormy bustle; Paris' gaslit blaze: All will pass:—till, leaning lastly From his throne within the heavenly deep, God will work once more, more vastly, Sending on the whole earth rest and sleep. ADAM AND EVE THE FIRST NIGHT IN PARADISE TIME, B.C.— Adam. O Eve, the darkness deepens. Yet I see Through the tall branches of this flowering tree Faint streaks of light. 'Twas there the sun sank low. Eve. Adam, the sunshine made the sweet earth glad, But now I tremble. Darkness makes me sad: I thought the golden sun would never go. Adam. And yet, as fades the sun, the tender light In thine eyes, Eve, seems ever to grow bright: The sun is little, so that I have thee. Eve. Thou art my lord and king. I cannot fear: The deepening darkness draws our souls more near: The day was sweet, and sweet the night will be. Adam. See—from the branches of the trees depend Lamps many-coloured, glowing without end From branch and branch,—or are they in the sky? Eve. I know not. Now, behold, a ghostly sun, White in the darkness, rises there alone, And, flashing into silver, floats on high. Adam. O Eve, the flowers were sweet, the day was bright: But is not darkness sweeter than the light? For now our lips seem nearer. Let them meet! Eve. My limbs feel heavy with the sultry day. There's mystery in that white lamp's glittering ray! Why does my heart at your lips' pressure beat? Adam. I call these small lamps, stars—that lamp, the moon. Rest in my arms: the sun may rise up soon; More golden than all sunshine is thine hair. Eve. I love this darkness better than the light: I feared to touch thee then. But now 'tis right In thine embrace to rest. I'm happy there! Adam. And, Eve, I worship thee, and not the light. This darkness, which I call our bridal night, Is sent by God that I may treasure thee. Eve. I love the darkness better than the day. The fruits my red lips fondled fade away, And now thy lips assert their sovereignty. Adam. Let us pray God the sun may never rise! I never looked before deep in thine eyes: I never felt that thou wast wholly won. Eve. Adam, God took the sun away for this, Lest it should wax quite jealous of my kiss: But, Adam, I love thee and not the sun. CHRIST I. O Satan, thou art strong, and yet behold! Thou shalt not snatch one sheep from out my fold, Nor one star from the star-bright air. Wherever thou canst pass, God goes before: Seek thou the lonely heart, or lonely shore, And thou shalt find my Father there. The saddest soul is his.—The loneliest rose That all unloved upon the hill-side blows He guards and tends with loving hand.— The least frail rose-pink shell is in his care,— Though it be least of all the shells that were Tossed last night on the golden sand.— All sinful souls are his.—He can redeem The tiger-heart and tiger-eyes that gleam: The hands that seek for human prey. Plunge down to deepest hell. Yet God is there. He passes unscorched through its burning air, And turns its lurid night to day. From evil blossoms good. The God who fills With flowers the hollows of the green-robed hills And fills with bloom the lap of spring Is the same God who at the helm presides When the wild vessel plunges through white tides: The reckless waters own their King. Through me the thought of God that underlies The hills and vales and woods and clouds and skies, That, ever unseen, works its will, Became just for one moment plain and clear: God spake once, so that every soul might hear: Judge of the ocean by the rill. The ocean, deep, eternal, rolls along:— Lifting its billows, foaming, stormy, strong, It plunges on from shore to shore. But yet the silver rill that all men see Has its own waves. God's image was in me, The human God whom ye adore. II. Nor, Satan, hast thou learned with all thine art The subtle secret of one woman's heart:— She serves, thou deem'st, the tyrant best? She yields herself,—as freely as the snow That lets the passers by tramp to and fro Above it, baring its white breast? Thou deem'st that true love fails, and lust succeeds? That love may whisper to the river-reeds, But cannot reach a woman's ear? Thou deem'st the tyrant's plan the plan that wins: That woman courts man for his very sins, And worships best in abject fear? But for a moment she shall love the base: Nor is this true love. Then her sweet sad face, Divine through deepest agony, Shall seek the presence of a heavenly friend:— Who suffers anguish to the very end Must, ere that end comes, worship me. I win her love by my own wreath of thorn. O Satan, thou canst hate, and thou canst scorn; Thy vaunting words are fierce and strong: This thou canst never do—by love redeem One woman; change wild passion's sin-stained dream Into an angel's sinless song! I yielded up the tender marriage-kiss, The common lot of love, content with this— That in far days beyond my dream All women of all nations should agree That man's most noble love sprang first from me: The stars I lighted, daily gleam. No flower of love in your wild world to-day Blossoms, save for love-seeds I flung away Upon the breeze of Palestine. New life to woman—this it was I gave. She passed with me the portals of the grave, And rose with her white hand in mine. Never she weeps to-day, but I too weep.— I send the stars to guide true lovers' sleep. I make the bright sea blue for these. The Father hath put all things in my hand: I make the emerald grass adorn the land, And gem with ruby fruit the trees. O Satan, Satan, thou shalt pass away! A million years are but one single day Before high God's eternal gaze. Two thousand years have passed since Calvary's gloom Deepened around me,—still thy sins consume Thyself, and all who seek thy ways. O lonely spirit, who hast no power to see The deathless spirit of love that shines in me And in the Father of all things; O spirit, who feedest on thine own despair And see'st alone the shadow in the air Of thine own form and sombre wings: O spirit, who see'st in woman just a flower, White, fragrant, sweet to pluck in pleasure's hour, And who wouldst have man share thy creed; O spirit, who on the blood-red battle-plain See'st nought but wet heaps of the newly slain,— In cornfields see'st alone the weed: O spirit, to whom the stars are blots on space; Who tarriest in thy dreary dwelling-place, Despairing, doubting, and alone: How would it be if from the highest air A voice said: “Thine ineffable despair Is ended. Thou too hast a throne. “Thou hast a throne, but not the lonely seat Whereon thou sittest while the storm-winds beat Around and o'er thee through the vast.” How were it with thee if the high God said: “O Satan, raise unto the stars thine head; Thy woes and sins lie in the past.” There is a loneliness divinely sweet, My Father's; his in whom all spirits meet, And yet who dwells apart, alone. In every petal of each new-born rose His sweet creative bounty blooms and glows: All seas make music round his throne. The purple depths of the eternal space Serve him for home and boundless dwelling-place; Yet dwells he in the humblest heart. His loneliness is ever unlike thine, For Love creates the loneliness divine, And Hate is regnant where thou art. The eyes of Love are those alone which see.— When the great English warrior followed me And passed into the land divine, What sawest thou, Satan, with thy lurid eyes? Thou thoughtest death came like a fell surprise; That Gordon's thoughts were even as thine. Thou sawest his body flung into the wave. “The Nile,” thou thoughtest, “is this soldier's grave. He toiled. God hath rewarded well. His faith in God,—what was it but a dream? Soon will his corpse grow rotten in the stream.” Such was thy thought, when Gordon fell. But I, the spirit of God beyond the gloom, Knew that for love there is no grave, no tomb:— God dies not. Those who live in him Share the eternal life that was before The first wave rippled on earth's first green shore; That will be when all stars wax dim. This is the eternal life I came to show:— The life all men may share in here below, And carry out in heights above: The life that through God's veins with great throbs burns; The life whose rapture thrills him when he turns Weakness to strength, and hate to love. This, God's own life, was, ere one sea-bird flew Above the primal ocean faint and blue And dull and lifeless, stretching far: Before the deep primordial dark was lit By the first golden fire-spark piercing it With flame that gathered to a star. And this the life of God beyond all creeds, Beyond the thoughts of frail men and their deeds, Beyond their stars, and dreams of space, Extends for ever towards the eternal gloom Where solar systems plunge into their tomb As cataracts plunge, and end their race. When over the last purple steep of sky The gold star-cataracts plunge themselves, and die, When heaven is left again alone, God's heart will still be starful, and supreme: Across his soul's sky still the stars will gleam, And through his thought the winds will moan. The heart that said, “Let light awake and be!” That bade the first blue billows of the sea Arise and laugh in dawn's bright air: The heart that said, “Let golden sunrise flame:” Will still abide unchangeably the same When suns nor moons nor waves are there. The heart that bade the storm-winds wail or roar Along the rocks of many an iron shore And summoned thunders from the deep Will still abide the same, when the last breeze Dies in a whisper in the dying trees,— When the tired thunder sinks to sleep. CHORUS OF SPIRITS OF LIGHT I. However sad man's lot, Despair should enter not The suffering heart of man. God by one single stroke Can heal the heart he broke, So carrying out his plan. For no man sighs in vain: The humblest creature's pain Is known to God on high. He hears the horse's neigh; He hears his red-breasts pray; He hears his throstles sigh. He hears his violets plead, And on the thirsty mead He sends the gladdening rain. The golden buttercup That sighs its sweet heart up To heaven, sighs not in vain. No bright marsh-marigold Is withered by the cold Of late tempestuous May Without a pitying thought Of God, who hastening brought At last the warm sun-ray. The trefoil owes to him (Just as the cherubim Receive from him their crowns!) Its crown of fairy gold That lights the wind-swept wold Or glitters on the downs. The daisy once was white —Until it caught a sight Of angels in the air. Such rapture flushed the flower That, ever since that hour, Its glad pink blush is there! So with the sons of men.— God often and again By sudden stroke can change The most unequal lot: Aye, oftentimes his thought Takes roads and courses strange. How often has he sent, To bring some soul content, An angel all in white— When on the window-sill A snowdrop by his will Has blossomed in the night! How often has he brought From sorrow beyond thought A peace exceeding praise. Though daylight bring despair, There shall be starlight fair And hope in the moon's rays. Above the weary town The silver moon smiles down: The towers and turrets shine. The fog-clouds roll away In banks of sullen grey Along the river-line. Though man's vast cities breed Deep misery indeed, They yield their joys as well. Not all the city life Is one long round of strife, Or one grim coign of hell. With song and laugh and shout The children sally out, Poor hoarse-throat London rooks! They leave the streets dull-grey, And seek the meadows gay Where gleam the silver brooks. We follow where they go: Pale faces all aglow, And hearts no longer sad. See! one child's fingers hold A kingcup. Crown of gold Would make a queen less glad. They paddle in the brook: They strive—in vain—to hook With crooked pins and thread The minnows flashing through The waters clear and blue, Or roach with eye-rings red. Their laughter is divine! Their merry glances shine!— Oh, God is good to these. They make grand holiday Amid the fragrant hay And under the elm-trees. What could an angel need More than this grassy mead Which buttercups enstar? The blue sky shines out clear: Heaven seems so very near, And hell so very far! Their London life is hell Maybe. To-day this dell Where white wild roses bloom Is heaven indeed, and God Is in the golden-rod And in the yaffle's plume. God speaks to children thus: And he commissions us To guard them as they go. In God's great endless park From daylight until dark They wander to and fro. Then, when the night sinks down The white moon o'er the town Shines out and points the way The children's feet have trod Sweet country roads with God For one long summer day. II. Moreover things men dread— War's reckless sword, stained red, And trumpet-bearing hand,— The thunder of the seas,— Swift arrows of disease,— The thirsty wastes of sand,— Blue leagues of glittering ice That crushes in a vice The ship that tempts its grip,— All evil things and strange,— The loves that pale and change, That once lay lip to lip,— All these things God includes In his vast rule. Man broods On ceaseless plan and plot; But under and above Is the eternal love, The God who changes not. God does not dread the storm That shakes the ship's frail form: He sees beyond the night. The sailor fears, for he Sees darkness whelm the sea— But God's eye sees the light. The lover's broken heart Sees all sweet dreams depart, For all his dreams were one. He sees to-day's black gloom, And thunder-clouds that loom— But God's eye sees the sun. God hears to-morrow sing, And voice of birds that wing Through future boughs their way. Man only marks and sees The chill and leafless trees; Man only sees to-day. Man only sees the earth To-day. God marks the birth Of blossoms yet to be.— Man sees the storm-drum swing. God sees the white gull's wing Upon a stormless sea.— Man sees the earthquake's shock Rend house and tower and rock,— Feels horror over all. God, 'neath to-morrow's sun, Sees the green lizard run Along the shored-up wall.— Man worships in one star. In globes that near and far Whirl in their maddening race God brings forth ever-new Life, thrilling the strange blue Unsounded depths of space. God, in that he is God, Upon the winds hath trod And rested on the storm. The stars are in his fold; Nor plunges from his hold One comet's angry form. And yet the God who counts The stars on the dark mounts Of heaven, nor loses one, Will let no frail heart break; And for one daisy's sake He would create a sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol VII: FROM DAWN TO SUNSET PRELUDE DAWN TO SUNSET Beneath the high majestic morning gleaming Once field and mount and moor and forest lay: O'er joyous vale and hill I wandered, dreaming That all life's hours were as the dawn of day. The sun's touch woke the golden daffodilly; His clear beam drew the snowdrop from repose: Then first love said, “My heart is like the lily!” And passion said, “My soul is as the rose!” First love and passion with the sun's rich glory Mixed souls as ardent as that mighty flame. When love spake, every flower took up love's story: When passion spake, dream-flowers yet lovelier came. So love and passion took the world with sweetness, With sovereign sceptre swayed the sea and land: The flowers at love's touch won their full completeness, And passion thrilled the world through woman's hand. Woman was queen of all the young day's splendour, Her crown was woven of morning's lustrous light. At noontide love, perhaps, a shade less tender To man's heart seemed,—passion a shade less bright. Through the still afternoon, when shadows lengthened And on the hills fell silence as of grief, Though deep within the soul love's sweet force strengthened, The fierce heat scorched full many a flower and leaf. Full many a dream had passed, the light of morning No longer lingered on the sapphire wave. The shadows whispered, as in sombre warning, “The sun's sea-cradle is the great sun's grave! “The sea, from which he rose to fill the air-spaces With light that laughed to see his victory won, His joy reflected in a million faces, Will spread forth darkness, and engulf the sun. “As surely as the morning flamed resplendent, Full, as it seemed, of leagues of deathless light, Will evening, dark slave on the sun attendant, Turn traitor, slay the sun, and serve the night.” Ah! so the shadows whispered. But I waited, I let the dreary shadows tell their tale: I watched the flowers within the woods belated; I saw the light upon the hill-tops fail. I saw the sun's gold chariot, wave-encumbered, Sink in those very waters whence it shone— Not long, devoid of life, the darkness slumbered: Star-torches flashed round black night's ebon throne. Then, as Love's heart made all its vast aim clearer, I saw that one pale sun had taken flight For this—that Love might bring to man's gaze nearer Unnumbered suns, and never-ending light. ELEVEN YEARS AGO Eleven years since all the night was filled With thee, and at thy spirit-touch I thrilled, Long years of pain. Ah! wilt thou never, blossom of my dream, Within the palace of my slumber gleam, Never again? All seems so far, so long ago, The sweet joy that I once did know! Thou camest: and the solemn night was hushed, And on thy face the rose of passion blushed, So soft and fair; And I was wrapt in ecstasy sublime, And wafted upward towards an unknown clime Of lordlier air; And yet it seems so far to-day. The heavens were blue. They are so grey! Thou camest: and before thy feet fell dead Each sin and terror, and thy queenly head Lay close to mine; And all the music of our ancient shore Seemed round about our listening hearts to pour A chant divine. O Alice, o'er eleven years The winged thought flies and wakens tears. Thou camest.—Ah, what days have since been ours! Thorns I have gathered. Hast thou gathered flowers? How long and strange The gloomy sun-forgotten years have been, As day passed day and scene succeeded scene With little change. It seemeth now a far-off thing, That night when all the stars did sing! Thou wilt come? When the sunset o'er the sea Brightens to solemn gold, wilt thou not be Beside the waves? When all the flowers of life are pale and dead, Wilt thou not stand beside the last flower's head With touch that saves? I missed thee at life's dawn. Shall I Possess thee once before I die? Thou wilt come. Surely when the roses die, And never more the lily's laugh is nigh, In autumn days,— When the great red leaves burn with autumn fire, As I with lifelong measureless desire, The woodland ways Will smile to see thee pass along, And, almost, wake to summer song! Thine eyes of old were wet with tender love; Passion fell like an aureole from above Upon thy brow: How is it with thee now long years have seen Our forest haunts devoid of bard and queen, Most songless now? Wilt thou for ever tarry, sweet? Is it not time that hands should meet? Thou camest through the night. Wilt thou not come When all the blossoms of long labour bloom Around thy path? Lo! for the eleven long years I, day and night, Have laboured, Alice, for thy soul's delight, And faced the wrath Of time, and conquered time, I deem: Make love's truth sweeter than a dream! Feb. 13, 1882. LYRICS AND BALLADS I. IN AUTUMN If thou and I indeed must part, If even the sweetest days must close, If time that severs rose from rose Must also sever heart from heart,— Oh, then let not our parting be In Spring, that were too hard to bear! For then the copses ring with glee, A thousand blossoms scent the air. When Spring's glad myriad voices Sing love-songs of the heart, When every bird rejoices, It were too sad to part! If thou and I must face the night, The darkness where hopes earthly end,— If, having called me “sweetest friend,” Thou yet must vanish from my sight,— Oh, then let not our parting be In Summer, that were worse to bear! Such glory rests upon the sea; This world is then so wondrous fair. When every hour discloses More fully Summer's heart To Summer's countless roses, 'Twere sadder still to part! If thou and I must face the fate So many souls have faced before, And, having met, must meet no more, And, having loved, have loved too late,— Oh, let our maddening parting be In Autumn. If we part at last, Let it be when the winds at sea Thunder “Despair” in every blast! When wild red leaves are flying, Each bleeding at the heart, Then is the time for sighing, Then is the time to part! II “THE BRIGHT YOUNG DAYS” Long life brings many a blessing; With the years man's wisdom grows: There are world-wide wrongs for redressing, There are noble truths to disclose. Yet ever man's heart keeps turning, With a strange and a fathomless yearning, To the beautiful bright young days When the blue sea laughed in the bays,— When the sunlight gilded the meadows, In the beautiful bright young days! There is love for the old in their season (Bright gold is the autumn grain)— But the love that knew nothing of reason, Will it ever be with us again? No: ever man's heart keeps turning With a wild gaze tearful and burning To the love of the sweet young days, For the tenderest laughter is May's,— The rich forest-gold is October's But the rose and its splendour are May's! So the songs that will perish never, Be the world's age what it may, That will haunt men's hearts for ever Till the ashes of life turn grey, Are the beautiful songs of yearning Where the soul is swift and burning, The songs of the bright young days Ere flowers forsook the ways,— The songs of the days that are vanished, The beautiful bright young days! III. THE LAND EVERLASTING The fairest things, alas! are ever fleetest; How glad, and yet how short, is sunny May: For just one hour the rose is at its sweetest; The violet's perfume lasts but for a day. For some short weeks the waves are at their brightest; The stars grow pale within the morning air: One day the chestnut-bloom is at its whitest— The next day sees it wither and despair. And so with love.—It has its perfect splendour, Its summer glory, when the twain hearts meet: Its perfect hour of June, its moment tender, Its sudden rapture, and its perfume sweet. But ah! it follows the departing roses! It trembles when the thunder smites the sky: At autumn airs its fragrant blossom closes; At touch of wintry wind its petals die. And yet beyond the days of pain and sadness, Beyond time's seasons full of clouds and grief, There must be somewhere everlasting gladness,— A heaven that sees no red-stained autumn leaf.— The loved souls who have left us travel thither; Within the gateways of that heaven they stand: Ah, there the roses never pale nor wither! There is no loveless winter in that land! IV. AUTUMN WAILINGS When youth is gone, and love is gone, What lights the woodland way? October's sunset, chill and wan; The light of Autumn grey. When youth is gone, and love is fled, For us the world might well be dead! When youth is gone,—as dead leaves go Along the autumnal blast,— Then first ourselves we seem to know What all shall know at last; The autumn weariness of life, Past love and labour, zeal and strife. When love is gone,—as blossoms fade, Fade swiftly one by one,— Our tired hearts tremble, as cold shade Replaces summer sun. When youth and love alike are fled, The brain lives on, the heart is dead. V. THE TEARLESS DAYS Was it sweet to have lived, I wonder, In the days when the world was young? When, parting the boughs in sunder, In the forest the wood-nymph sung? Was it sweet, in the woods' recesses, To mark 'neath a moonlit sky The glitter of Venus' tresses As the queen and her train swept by? She must have been grand and peerless, Queen Venus, with Love in her train. Then the eyes of the world were tearless: Will they ever be tearless again? Our woods and our groves are chilly, The goddess is no more there: 'Mid our rocks and regions hilly We mark not the light of her hair. But still on the hedge there are roses, There is light in our true love's eyes; In the woods there are wild-flower posies, And the sun still smiles in the skies. Not a dark cloud threatens with thunder, Not a white storm-wave gives tongue: Shall we ever grow old, I wonder, While the love in our hearts is young? VI. CHANGELESS LOVE The bloom is fair upon the hawthorn hedges; The throstles sing from many a budding spray; Blue ripples laugh along the river-edges; The blue sky seems to whisper, “It is May!” And yet the thought of tawny-leaved September Dismays the fancy with a touch of gloom: Aye, and a mem'ry of old wild November, Whose storm-winds trumpet forth pale Autumn's doom. When love is at its sweetest, in its season, When it is full of summer joy and mirth, There sometimes comes the thought, “In love is treason. Not always Summer sways the green-robed earth.” The bloom is bright upon the garden roses; Their red lips whisper, “Love is king to-day:” Man's heart upon love's word in faith reposes, Yet even love, so trusted, can betray. Oh! is there not some heart which never changes, Some sympathy eternal and divine, Some love that time nor weakens nor estranges? O sweetheart, let such changeless love be thine! Then, whether storm-winds wail through wild November, Or whether August splendour floods the sky, Glad past all words it will be to remember That, come what will, sweet love can never die. VII. PAIN'S CONSTANCY When the thought of our joys forsakes us The thought of our sadness clings. Its lovers and friends grief makes us, But joy is a spirit with wings. The place where we met is forgotten Though the marvellous rose grew there; But the meadow-sweet where we parted Wins its sweetness from despair. The stars of the past have a lustre Outshining the light of the sun: The dreams of our youth will haunt us Till our life's whole race is run. Aye, ever in pale December, When the fires of Christmas glow, The dream that our hearts remember Is the dream of long ago. There is friendship in countless faces; There is true sweet love in a few; There are blossoms in endless places; Each summer brings skies of blue: But the flowers our young hands gathered Are the sweetest flowers that be, And the faces we love for ever Are the faces we never shall see! VIII. “IF ONLY THOU ART TRUE!” If only a single Rose is left, Why should the Summer pine? A blade of grass in a rocky cleft; A single star to shine. —Why should I sorrow if all be lost, If only thou art mine? If only a single Blue-bell gleams Bright on the barren heath, Still of that flower the Summer dreams, Not of his August wreath. —Why should I sorrow, if thou art mine, Love, beyond change and death? If only once on a wintry day The sun shines forth in the blue, He gladdens the groves till they laugh as in May And dream of the touch of the dew. —Why should I sorrow if all be false, If only thou art true? IX. A DREAM OF A FLOWER I dreamed a wonderful dream of a flower. On the hill-side green it grew: But the tongue would fail, nor has brush the power To paint that flower for you. It scented the hill-side far and wide, And scented the fields of corn: Its odour was sweet through the tall gold wheat, And sweet on the airs of morn. And when I woke, I marvelled: My soul seemed breathing still A fragrance never lavished On mortal grove or hill. And never, till love came down from above With its rapture and despair, Did I know what it meant,—nor God's intent When he sent that dream so fair. 'Twas as if God said, “The flower so sweet That upon the hill did gleam Was love; for love is my tenderest flower, And only blooms in a dream!” And still I see the blossom, And still the scent is there; And sometimes it brings gladness, But oftener despair. X CONSUMMATION Life was full of sweet emotion When the spring of life was fair: Bright blue shone the summer ocean; Songs of throstles charmed the air. Passing through the fields one day, Every hedge was rich with may, Sweetening, silvering, every spray. Followed fast the summer's glory, Sheen of lily, flame of rose: Flower by flower took up the story, Till the tired eye claimed repose. Though the summer's touch could thrill Flower and leaf and wave and hill, Something sweet was missing still. Ah, my queen, my sovereign sweetness, When thy fairy glance I knew, Life attained its full completeness And the rose its tenderest hue! All things waited, pale, undone— As the stars his heart has won Watch the sea-line for the sun. XI. BLACKBERRY PICKING How happy we were in the deep green wood, Picking blackberries, you and I! Round us the heather and tall ferns stood: Over us shone the sky. Rich and ripe in the bramble-copse The tempting blackberries gleamed: In the dark-green feathery fir-tree tops The wood-doves cooed and dreamed. Far away is the deep green wood And the silent ferny glen Where happy and hand-in-hand we stood, Craving for nothing then. Far away that happy day Seems in the sunlit past: Why will never a pleasure stay? Do only the sad things last? Yet in your album safely dried A heather sprig I see: The delicate purple tints have died, But it blossoms still for me. For the joyous past is never dead,— No, still the blackberries gleam, And still in the fir-trees overhead The wood-doves coo and dream! XII. RED LEAVES AND GREEN LEAVES What is the whisper of the leaves Round ruined turrets reddening fast, Or nestling under cottage-eaves While autumn winds go sighing past? “Life is sorrow,” they whisper, “Life is only a dream: The sky seemed blue, but it was not true; The sky is as grey as the stream!” What is the whisper of the heart When love and life have ceased to please, When passion's fairy dreams depart And cold winds rustle through the trees? “Life is trouble,” it whispers, “Trouble and wild despair: Once love seemed bright, but at morning light Love's face was no more fair!” Yet autumn leaves and troubled soul May hardly read life's tale aright: Green leaves shall crown the elm-tree bole And love's joy shall outlive the night. “Green leaves,” the red leaves whisper, Fast falling one by one: When night's stars die, behold the sky Laughs out to see the sun! XIII. SISTER ROSES “O sister,” the white rose said to the red, “Could only my face be as bright as thine! I am pale. Could I only be pink instead, I would lift to the sunlight my beautiful head, And never be weary, or weep, or pine!” “O sister,” the red rose said to the white, “Could only my face be as pale as thine! I am doomed to be gathered to-night, to-night,— I shall faint at a ball in the hot gas-light, While you will be glad in the cool moonshine.” “Ah! sister,” the white rose sighed to the red, “You are wrong, you are wrong, and the truth is mine. Far better than life in the dull flower-bed It is to be worshipped, and then to fall dead Where live hearts flutter, and gay lights shine.” XIV. SPRING AND AUTUMN “The rose-tree longs for its beautiful rose, And sighs till its bloom is there: So life will never attain repose Till love its exquisite blossom blows In the beautiful scented air.” These dream-sweet words from a poet's page A girl to her mother read; And the young girl smiled, while the eyes of age Watched softly the fair gold head. But the mother's eyes were dim with tears, While the daughter's eyes were gay; For the mother thought of the long-past years, And of dead sweet hopes, and of sighs and fears, But the young heart dreamed of to-day. “And why are you sad?” the young voice said, “For reading of love is sweet: O bright-eyed Love, with the lips so red— I would fall at his darling feet!” Then the mother said: “Dream on, my child, For love is a beautiful dream; And truly the earth were a desert wild, Had never the eyes of sweet love smiled With their wonderful magic gleam. Smile on: but leave their thoughts to the old, For the poet's words that bring Delight to the young, and a hope untold, Full oft on the older heart fall cold. Mine are the grey locks: yours are the gold! I am autumn: you are the spring!” XV. SHOREHAM CHURCH Storm and sunshine, summer glory, August thunder, wintry snow, Many a human sweet love-story, Many a tale of wrath and woe,— Hours of dark funereal anguish, Hours when 'neath the summer sun Even the flowers he loves must languish, Hours when autumn's peace is won— All of these the church has known, Gazing from its tower of stone; Watching gladness change to grief, Golden to the faded leaf. Witness here to something holier Than our cares and strife, it stands. Round its turrets time creeps slowlier Than across the changing lands. Fields of corn in blood may welter, Human cities reek with crime,— Here is blessing, here is shelter From the sins and shocks of time. Human race succeeds to race, Still the tower stands in its place. “Tremble,” cries the wild wind's tongue; But it answers, “I am young!” Many a lightning-flash, half-grazing, Threatens,—still the tower, upright, At the morning sun is gazing, Scatheless, at the stars by night. Though the soul of man may darken, Still that grey old tower of stone To the sunrise-hymn will hearken, Stand erect, alert, alone, Facing seasons soft or grim, Watcher when man's eyes grow dim, Guardian of man's hopes and fears Through another thousand years. XVI. A BALLAD OF WINTER Said Winter to the Rose: “When first my cold breath blows, Your gentle reign is done.” But said the Rose quite fearless: “New splendid buds and peerless Are waiting for the sun.” Said Winter to my love: “With fur and muff and glove Guard thou thyself, or die.” But said my love: “What folly! Though flowers be dead, the holly Is bright against the sky.” Said Winter unto me: “Take heed, arise and flee; Thy strength is spent. Beware!” Said I: “My love is near me; Her bright eyes soothe and cheer me; Lo! June is in the air.” XVII. THE GOLDEN ISLES Wonderful golden islands Of old, so the fable ran, Lay in the Western Ocean, Closed from the vision of man Wonderful cloudless islets, Set in a stormless sea; Splendid with banks of coral, Blossom and fruit and tree. Wonderful magic islands Ever before us gleam. Ever we strive to reach them: Ever they melt in a dream. Ever we struggle onward Over the lonely seas: Never the islands glitter, Never their fringe of trees! So it goes on for ever. What will the issue be? Oh, will our vessel never Traverse this endless sea?— If we can reach our dreamland, What will be waiting there? Rapture of noble passion? Pallor of white despair? XVIII. THE GOLDEN CARP Fishing! fishing! fishing! The old man sits in a dream; Wishing! wishing! wishing! Watching his float on the stream. Minnows and roach and gudgeon Lie in heaps by his side; But he scowls like an old curmudgeon, He never seems satisfied. So I passed through the open gateway, By a copse of larch and fir, And I asked the old man straightway, “What are you fishing for, sir?” And he said, with his features working And a keen look strange and sharp, “Do you see in the rushes lurking That monstrous golden carp?” And I looked, and I saw the willows, And I saw the rushing stream— I marked the blue swift billows, But I saw no golden gleam. Ah me! he has fished for ever (And we all of us do the same) For a prize that glittered never, For a carp that never came. XIX. AUTUMN LEAVES What do the red leaves whisper? What do the wild winds say, When they wail and roar o'er hill and shore On a stormy autumn day? “The past was sweet with flowers, And beautiful was June; But now on leafless bowers Looks down the lonely moon.” What do our sad hearts utter? What do our spirits cry, When autumn hues at length suffuse Vale, hill, and wood, and sky? “Love's summer heart was tender, But summer glory goes, And Love forgets the splendour He once loved in the rose.” XX. HARROW HILL O green old slopes of Harrow Hill That countless hearts remember, Those hearts are often near you still; Bright May can touch December. O Harrow Hill, green Harrow Hill, What thousands April-hearted Have paced your slopes! They love you still, Though young dreams have departed. O green old slopes of Harrow Hill, Which English elms environ, One deathless shadow haunts you still— The mighty shade of Byron. The soul in him to greatness grew Upon your greensward dreaming; Though Harrow skies then little knew The star within them gleaming. O green old slopes of Harrow Hill All change and storm outliving, In hearts of those who love you still What memories are surviving! O fair green slopes, so bright with hopes By countless young hearts cherished, Old hearts will still love Harrow Hill, Though countless hopes have perished! XXI. CHURCH-BELLS The church-bells rang, and the skylark sang, On a beautiful morn in May; And a mother and son walked side by side, And the boy's gold head was the joy and the pride Of the mother's heart that day. They opened the worn old churchyard gate, And a sunbeam shot from the sky, And its glory was shed on the boy's gold head And it tinted the daisies tipped with red And the buttercup-fields hard by. Long years passed by, and the boy became A soldier of fortune bold: Through the East his fame flashed on like a flame,— He feathered his nest, and he played his game, And won renown and gold. But his hands were stained with sin and crime, Aye, red with blood some say: 'Neath the Indian sun wild deeds were done, And a dark and an evil name was won As the gold hair grew to grey. The church-bells rang, and a skylark sang, On a beautiful morn in May; By a tomb-stone white in the morning light Stood a lonely man, and the sun was bright Not on gold hair now but on grey. His swift thoughts flew o'er the fifty years, And a sunbeam shot from the air As he stood by his mother's grave in tears; And the church-bells whispered in his ears, “It is never too late for prayer!” XXII. THE VOICE OF THE RIVER The river was ever a siren: It sings to the reed-fringed shore; It sings to the floating lilies, And they love it more and more. When the autumn leaves are golden It gathers them all to its wave: It takes, but it never tells them That its waters are deep as the grave. And it sings with a siren sweetness As it eddies to and fro To fairer things than blossoms, With its tempting cold dark flow. And some there are who listen, And they plunge in the cold deep wave: One moment the gold locks glisten— But the moonlight cannot save! But oh, there are voices sweeter Than the river's siren tone! Not even the saddest outcast In the moonlight stands alone. For the face of Christ in the moonlight Shines out over the wave, And he saith to the saddest of mortals, “It was you that I came to save.” XXIII. LIFE'S LAST GIFT A thousand gifts life brings us, And some are passing fair: What perfect flowers it flings us When June's breath scents the air! Yes, Life begins with pleasure: The year begins with glee; With golden blossom-treasure And stormless azure sea. Then how the prospect darkens:— Hearts fail us, and betray; Death glides amid our loved ones,— Steals one by one away: Life, which began in glory, Grows sombre towards its close, For old age chills our pleasures As autumn chills the rose. But one thing life will bring us In autumn days and cold: October's lips can tell us What August never told. Life's latest gift is fairer In that all past gifts cease; Life's last gift is supremest, For life's last gift is peace. HYMN [When our bitter foes surround us] When our bitter foes surround us, Father, be our stay! When in chains our sins have bound us And our follies have discrowned us, Shine thou on our way! Starlike through the darkness gleaming, Father, lift and save! Strengthen us through youth's wild dreaming, And when age's wan moon beaming Slants upon our grave. When fierce passions would betray us, Father, safeguard be! Rose-crowned pleasures would delay us, Cares and griefs of life would slay us, Were it not for thee. Though rich flowers fill all life's garden, Thou art more than these. Thou canst soothe and heal and pardon, Soften the wild hearts that harden, Bend the stubborn knees. When our closest friends have failed us, Thou canst hold us fast. Friends who in life's morning hailed us Now as foes have oft assailed us, But thy love doth last! Lo! the grave's cold hands are taking Mother, wife, or child. What can dull the soul's lone aching, Save man's maddened heart from breaking In its anguish wild? Nought can aid us then but knowing, Father, that with thee Our dead dear ones live in glowing Tender new life, ever flowing From thy Being's sea. We, alive, would trust thee ever, Father, sweet and sure; Knowing that no death can sever,— Knowing that the grave parts never,— In thy love secure. November, 1881. HYMN [Through the foaming white-lipped surges] Through the foaming white-lipped surges, Great All-Father, steer us on. Pain behind us stings and scourges; In the sky the sun gleams wan. All our lives are blent with sorrow; Not one heart doth understand. When we sleep, we dread the morrow; Stretch thou forth thy strong right hand! Songs and flowers and sunsets fail us And the sweet God hidden in these. When pain's barbed red points assail us, Worthless is the singing breeze. Helpless is a rose to aid us When our feet grief's wild ways tread; When despair's fierce spears invade us, And the hopes of youth fall dead. Lift thou then, thou great All-Father, Thy majestic helping hand! All our weary spirits gather Towards thine own eternal land. Not one flower's exceeding splendour Helps a torn soul on its way: Thou, than all flowers far more tender, Change the darkness into day! O'er cold mount, through moonless hollow, O'er lone seas, our footsteps tend. God, thy banner we would follow! Yet is death the awful end? Past the peaks where stars wax breathless, Past all heights man dimly knows, Lift us: blend with ours thy deathless Fathomless divine repose. November, 1881. O MOON! I O moon thou shinest down this London street With light most sweet: What doest thou here? Once did thy clear Splendour illume a road for Iseult's feet? II Shonest thou once glorious o'er the Cornish foam To lead her home? Did moonlight fair Mix with her hair When through the night with Tristram she did roam? III O moon in this, the London of to-day, With clear soft ray Thou shinest,—but yet Dost thou regret Thy lands and flowers and loves so far away? IV For thou wast all unchanged when Jezebel Bowed 'neath thy spell: And, long ere she Shone, white like thee, Thy light o'er the unpeopled planet fell. V Thou hast seen the ages of great endless flowers In old-world bowers,— Of ferns now black Beneath our track; Thou hast sailed the sailless sea for lone vast hours. VI And now thou shinest down this London street So white and sweet; And all the din, Turmoil and sin, Of our great city thine unmoved eyes meet! VII With truth the Greek profound soul saw in thee The maiden glee Of Artemis,— Whose virgin kiss, Calm, unimpassioned, fell on hill and sea. VIII For all our city's travail moves thee not One breath, one jot! The city's roar Shakes thee no more Than lisp of wind-moved rush in loneliest spot. IX What doest thou here O Goddess with those eyes That thrill the skies? What doest thou here, Far from the drear Lone sea-wastes o'er which thy white sea-bird flies? X O pitiless silent lovely soulless moon, Soft as in June Thy tender white Bewitching light Falls o'er the city,—bright as o'er lagoon! XI O heartless Goddess! Are the spirits not dead Whom thy light led? And dost thou still The far skies fill,— What battle-fields beneath thy gaze have bled! XII But thou art changeless,—and as full of joy, Girl-moon, or boy, As in the days When through thy rays Paris led Helen towards the towers of Troy. QUESTIONINGS I. If God be dead, and life be void Of hope that lifted us and buoyed,— If heaven no more in front may shine,— Chorus of the sons and daughters of men.— Yet have we love's own wreaths to twine! If all be passed and over soon, And soulless gleam the stars and moon, And heartless the triumphant sun,— Chorus. Yet have we toil, till toil is done! If ne'er the dreams that once so bright Laughed golden-winged in April light A heavenly fair reward shall find,— Chorus. Yet have we rose-breath on the wind! If now beside the rush-fringed stream No naiad's sun-kissed locks may gleam,— If all the old gods with God be gone,— Chorus. Yet Love's firm footstep labours on! II. But there came answer through the night, Loud thundering from the mountain-height And whispering softly o'er the sea: “I am, and thou art part of me.” The great seas caught the sound, and mirth Rang through the sunlit vales of earth: O'er heathery hill and gold-flowered lea God's voice came—“These are part of me.” And lovers' souls no more were dead, Nor faded the sweet rose's head: They all were gladdened with strange glee; God said to each “Thou art part of me.” The lonely spirit, whose pathway dim Seems full of foes who encompass him, Has caught the sound and feels that he Is saved, since God said, “Trust in me.” The sinner feels God's tender glow Of pity about his dead heart flow: It flowers, as flowers a barren tree, For God said, “Son, believe in me.” O live strong God, make me a part Of thine unmeasured mountain-heart; Pure like the sky, strong like the sea, A spirit of boundless love like thee! “AND YET!” Hold thou thy loved one through the summer night; Soon 'twill be light; The armies of the stars will own defeat: The sun will frighten love from out the skies, With flaming eyes: But yet the night was sweet! The velvet lips that rested once on thine, With touch divine, Turn elsewhere. Will love pause, though tears entreat? Through all time, never!—Yet in days gone by (Yes, one swift sigh!) Those lips to thee were sweet. One hour of rapture, and the sun's warm breath; Then sunless death; Death for the poppies and the golden wheat: Death for the larkspur gathering pearls of dew, And pansies blue: Yet pansies find life sweet! Places where love in the old bright days was fair, And joys that were, Have one same sombre message to repeat; The grass will shortly wave above our tomb With green wild bloom— And yet the grass is sweet! The honeysuckle in the hedge last year Loved to be near Those lovers whispering on the garden-seat. Divided are those loving hearts to-day! Sundered for aye! Yet was not last year sweet? The fierce-eyed sun has risen, and we look back Upon love's track: Were ever starlit tender moods discreet? Could ever flower of fragrant passion bear The morn's keen air? (Yet passion-flowers are sweet!) The summer mocks us with its wealth of blue, And wondrous hue, And fervent fierce unsympathetic heat; The blossoms mock us with their wealth of sheen, Gay 'midst the green— Yet starlit nights are sweet! Love and all tender joys will soon be o'er, And we no more Shall thrill at the approach of woman's feet; Quiet we soon in the chill earth shall lie, My love and I— And yet my love is sweet! “HALF-SEEN!” O girl who turnest down the street, Over-slow yet over-fleet, Half-seen, Thy face was fair and soft and sweet I ween! Never through all eternity Shall I thy full true beauty see: Thou art lost For ever now alas! to me, Crowd-tost. It is so strange and sad to think That just one sudden broken link Snaps all. Our dreams are light-beams. Through a chink They crawl: Then something passes and the light Is quenched, and all again is night. So now Thou art gone, O clear of gaze and white Of brow! Thou art gone.—Yet wholly felt, half seen, A haunting grace was in thy mien And air; And soft as Helen's might have been Thy hair. Even the colour of thine eyes I ne'er shall know, more than of skies That beam Next year. In vain e'en fancy tries To dream! For fancy dreams of many things— Of bird that flies, and bird that sings I'the snare; But finds the bird with swiftest wings Most fair. We love the thing we cannot gain; And most of all what brings us pain We prize. I love, because I love in vain, Thine eyes. In unseen bower, on unknown day, Thine eyes will dream (be it brown or grey, Thy glance!)— And what Love wins, he'll cast away Perchance. And I, who could have loved thee well, Shall never know what thing befell,— Nor see Thy moment's heaven, thy lifelong hell To be. Only the stars that watch thy sleep Will know if thou dost moan or weep, Or where Thou singest, or dost sink in deep Despair. What thou art, I shall never know.— One moment's pang. Then let it go, The pain! This dream-born flower can never blow Again. SUMMER'S DREAM The summer flees away, and who shall find or follow Her footstep, or discern the green-browed hollow Wherein fair summer seeks to rest, With flowers upon her breast? The summer flies.—Perchance her restless heart grows weary; Perchance she finds earth's love-tales waxing dreary; Perchance she tires of praise, and longs To escape men's lutes and songs. In forests weird and strange, she would be followed after By Jove's deep voice or swift Apollo's laughter; And would be gathered, like a rose, Into sublime repose. She would be seized from heaven, and in the flashing splendour Of the god's white arms wrapt, in sacred tender Ineffable supreme embrace, And know Love face to face. In the dim forest-deep, among soft blossoms sleeping, She dreams the golden-bowed keen god comes leaping Along the pink-flowered woodland ways, Upon his brows the bays. She dreams the white-browed god, her fiery-hearted lover, Comes, swiftly pressing through the tangled cover, And that his burning kiss falls light Upon her bosom white. But when she wakes, behold! the frost has touched the larches: She gazes now no more through leafy arches. The wind has changed. 'Tis keen and chill. Grey is the emerald hill. Apollo's harp is hushed. Lo! summer was but dreaming: Cold in the sky the unroyal sun is gleaming. Closed now are August's golden gates: Hard by November waits. Ah! woman too can dream. She dreams of Love for ever. Does Love fulfil one sweet old promise? Never! Love stoops from heaven one single day— Then wings, and he's away! The maiden dreams of Love. As Summer sought Apollo, The maiden would find deep-eyed Love and follow: Till the eyes of very Time grow dim, The girl would follow him. But will he wait for her? Will Love delay his flying? Never! not for ten thousand wild hearts sighing. Love kisses once, and then he goes To seek an unkissed rose. So vanish all the dreams! So woman's heart is broken! She moans, “Would soft-voiced Love had never spoken! Would Love had never seemed so fair— For Love's name is Despair.” TWO SONNETS I. REPRESENTATIVE SOUNDS A young girl's perfect ringing silvery laugh; The strange slow sullen plunge of waves that break; The ripple of leafage which the June winds shake; The lisp of rivers which the breezes quaff; The flapping of the flag around its staff; The subtle hissing of the sinuous snake; The sighing of reeds upon the mountain-lake; The salmon's fierce splash, bleeding from the gaff;— The cheer of legions thundering through the breach; The songs of children, and their thoughtless glee; A woman's heartfelt moan of dull despair; The strong man's deep groan when the surgeons reach The rankling bullet; crash of falling tree; The light soft sound of heavy back-flung hair. II. REPRESENTATIVE COLOURS The sunlight glinting on a space of bright Green grass within a wood; the blue-green leaves Of the sea-poppy; the rich amber sheaves; The sea—grey-blue, or brown, or angry white, Or Southern blue against broad Southern light; A woman's hair—blue-black, or golden-brown; The sudden flash of jewels in a crown; The depth of purple-black vast starless night;— The subtle blending in a woman's eyes Of green and brown; a soldier's scarlet coat; A woman's white form,—nobly, fully, bare, Save for the shadow of chin upon the throat Shadeless; the red sun seen through fog-bound skies; The carmine sea-weed that green waves' lips tear. THE LAST FAREWELL A long farewell and strange, a deep farewell, I send thee, The last farewell of all— Not death's farewell, but life's.—May all life's joys attend thee Till life's last red leaf fall! All pleasures high be thine, all flowers bloom round about thee, All bright suns shine for thee! The sun cannot forsake, spring cannot smile without thee; All things thou swayest but me. Mine heart thou swayest no more. A nobler brave heart finds me, A stronger soul than thine. New chains of love are woven. A new love holds and binds me, And makes its sweetness mine. For years and years and years thy wondrous beauty held me, A captive at thy feet: To song and love and toil thy grey clear eyes impelled me, And love of thee was sweet. But thou,—thou hadst not heart to meet supreme devotion With love as pure and strong! The waves of love and praise fell back in their own ocean; No soft voice answered song. I asked for trust,—I sought for perfect truth,—I pleaded For tender love and faith: My eager words of love rose answerless, unheeded; Hear now what strong love saith. “Farewell! farewell! farewell!—My strangest saddest greeting, My last, I send to thee: Just the last silver sound of singing waves retreating, The last voice of our sea. “The last sound of the breeze amid our ferns and heather And many a mountain-pine; The last blue gleam of old sweet passionate August weather, The last song's sad last line. “The last voice of my youth.—My manhood turns not hither, It turns away from thee: It turns with tenderest love and tenderest yearning whither Thou canst not follow me. “It turns towards other eyes—eyes stedfaster and sweeter, Eyes yet more bright than thine; Towards love whose soul is sure, and whose young feet are fleeter To watch and follow mine. “So this last time in words I turn towards the old palace Of youth and love and song; Turn this last time to thee whom all my youth loved, Alice (And love's last look is long!) “Farewell! farewell! farewell!—Yet forceless for estranging Is the lute-voice of Art: The last and sad farewell, eternal and unchanging, Rings from the altered heart.” March 5, 1885. ON THE DEATH OF DR. CUMMING The mighty stars pursue their course And the waves break with ordered force, Heedless of man; All things flow outward from their source, As they began. One prophet more whose rash weak thought Set law and time and force at nought Has passed away: And still the green bright spring is brought From winter grey. The primrose and the crocus bold Still fill with pale or with deep gold The grass of spring: Still the first sure thrush as of old Starts up to sing. The cowslips yellow and violets blue Drape fields and banks in diverse hue; Nought fails us yet; Each spring's soft head hath glory new For coronet. As surely as summer comes, the rose In all its old rich grandeur blows, And gardens shine, And the fierce tiger-lily glows; Then comes the vine. The prophet who predicted all Should end so soon, himself must fall: The world swings on. Bright months flash by, dull seasons crawl, Till all are gone. But when the fresh clear mornings break On sea or shore or mountain-lake The same sun's might Bids still the same sweet flowers awake And bathe in light. The green immense smooth-curling seas Shake lions' manes before the breeze And no man stays The vast advancing files of these: They go their ways. The rash-tongued seer himself is dead; But no rose blooms to-day less red: No bell less blue. More light upon man's path is shed Than his thought knew. He passes: and the stars awake, And not one lessens for his sake Its wonted fire; Still hearts will bound, and hearts will break, At Love's desire! Will there be one hour less of bloom, Because he passes to his doom And leaves love here? Man's is the light,—his is the gloom, His is the fear. If there be judgment, 'tis for him Within the death-land dark and dim: This world is bright; Aye, brighter now that prophet grim Is lost in night. The birds may sing, the sun may shine, The blue grapes ripen on the vine, The hill-tops gleam, The wind may whisper to the pine Its latest dream: The butterfly may love the rose, The red bee in the hive repose Beside his queen, Without one fear lest God disclose Hell's sudden sheen. The emerald flies may buzz and wheel, The lizard through the leaves may steal With sides that flash; The Last Day's thunder will not peal With sudden crash. The fisher standing by the stream May watch the silver salmon gleam Above the weir; God will not trumpet through his dream “The end draws near!” The girl may pluck forget-me-not,— Not dreading lest the stream turn hot, The flowers turn white, As God in anger sears the spot With lightning-light. The youth may watch his true love's eyes, Without a fear lest horror rise Therein and dread At sight of hell's fierce underskies Of angry red. The world awakes; the prophet sleeps. With laughter in its eyes it leaps Towards newer things: And as its fruited corn it reaps, Its great heart sings! Not yet its end is.—Many a day Shall the brave world spin on its way Through joy and dole: Through dawns of gold and eves of grey Its wheels shall roll. While woman breathes, the world-heart glows Most young and fervent; while the rose Each year is red, The world's tired spirit may repose, But is not dead! July, 1881. HARROW v. ETON AT LORD'S 1881 Just twenty years ago the same shouts sounded. With boyish eager eyes I watched the field: Watched the red ball that o'er the live hedge bounded; Joined in the merry cries that rang and pealed. To-day with sense of speechless desolation Each dead year thrills me from its ghostly throne: Years that began with songs and exultation, Then left me in the starless dark, alone. How strange to think that these boy-hearts awaking To life to-day, are ignorant indeed! Yet that on each love's pitiless morning breaking Will change the hearts that sing to hearts that bleed. No spirit shall shun the love-doom waiting ready, Ready to seize and shape to newer things. All shall be whirled around Fate's frothing eddy, Helpless as are i'the stream a moth's white wings. Ye know so little of what shall surely follow: Your clear gaze centres on the cricket-green. You Venus touches not, nor great Apollo; Nought is to you the golden-girdled queen. Nought are her white arms eager for embraces— Eager as ever, though her shrines may fall. She waits. She peers into the young fresh faces. She wonders which heart first will heed her call. She wonders who will chant afresh her praises, Gathering wild garlands from the wind-swept wold, Crowning her now with fern or pink-tipped daisies; For silent are the lips which sang of old. Nought is she to you.—Yet than rivers clearer Shall ring some voice whose music waits afar. Daily Fate brings the destined moment nearer, As evening brings the sky its certain star. Sweeter one day shall sound a girl's soft laughter Than laugh of comrade brave, or trusty friend. Theirs is one hour: but hers is the hereafter. They triumph now: she triumphs till the end. Touching her hand, ye shall forget to covet The whitest flower that in earth's garden grows: Hearing her voice, ye shall for ever love it: Touching her lips, ye shall forget the rose. Far sweeter things there are than ye are dreaming In this strange world where love is linked to pain; Eyes with a lovelier light than summer's gleaming.— We mortals vanish. But the stars remain. The stars of love for ever shine resplendent: They lighted Byron on his lonely way. They still abide, in love's train still attendant, And they shall light you. Ye shall have your day. VENUS AND THE EVANGELISTS Gathered upon the beach one day I saw A group of preachers.—They had made a square With four green common benches, and they stood Within the square—just ordinary men, Shopkeepers, tradesmen, grocers, what you will. They stood within their green-bench-guarded square, With the wide grey indifferent sea behind And preached their rendering of the word of God. And with them stood some stumpy servant-maids, Sallow, ill-dressed, and awkward; and they sang With help of these their hardly sweet-toned hymns. And then along the beach there came a form Slender and graceful, robed in quiet black, A woman,—one it may be of the band Whom some call “gay,” and some “unfortunate.” She listened to the hymn, and soon received A hymn-book from a stumpy servant-maid, Red-cheeked, red-handed, and red-ribboned too. She stood there, leaning on the green top-bar Of one of the four benches, just outside The hollow angel-guarded preachers' square. —A myriad thoughts flew through me as I watched. “Lo! here is Venus, just outside the heaven Of these the Galilean folk,” I thought; “And yet her grace of mien and attitude Hath surely something in itself of heaven.” She leaned against the bench, and every limb Took of itself the right most fitting pose; She seemed a sudden message sent from Greece, And round her the weird gospel-music rang, And that top-bar of the dividing bench On which she leant seemed like God's judgment-bar, Or like a gulf between the righteous fixed And stately Venus on the other side, And all the ages' strife seemed symbolized By those gaunt preachers safe within the square, They and their women-followers, and the slight Poor fair sad woman in her black silk dress And white straw hat with flowers of lavender Who leant with such unconscious grace of form Against the bench,—against it, but outside. “And yet,” I thought, “is God within that square, Along with those gaunt-eyed repulsive men And sallow stumpy women, or is he Perhaps outside the bench-square sometimes too,— Just as the grey-waved calm far-stretching waste Of water yonder hath but little heed Of these four benches? is not God outside As well as inside—with his grey-waved sea And this grey-eyed poor woman? Surely, yes!” ISOLINA Lines Written on again Reading an old Romance O Isolina, loved in boyish fashion, Loved when the heart was nobly pure and free, Again I read thy tale of love and passion, Again forget the world and gaze on thee. Romance beyond romance is in thy story: I read the wild tale thirty years ago— Yet still I see the sunlight's ceaseless glory Poured over plains and hills of Mexico. And still, though thirty years have done their tragic Grim work on heart and weary brain of mine, Thy dark-fringed eyes retain their glow, their magic, And mine grow younger as they gaze in thine. The boy grew strong for thee, and manhood's yearning Throbbed through his heart and life became a dream: The man to-day, on his own steps returning, Regains his boyhood as thy dark eyes gleam. Thou filledst boyhood with wild thirst and hunger Of ardent passion, fiery, unexpressed: Thou makest manhood thirty long years younger, And bringest somewhat of repose and rest. Thou wast my earliest love-queen, even far earlier Than she who swayed my heart by Northern seas; Thou smiling under skies more blue and pearlier, And wandering 'mid strange tropic flowers and trees. When life flowed on, when the boy's heart grew older, Was any riper passion half so wild? As life progresses, our tired hearts turn colder: The boy loves best, while still in part a child. So, queen of high romance, take this song smiling At the old tale—yet smiling through its tears. How few real loves, for all their soft beguiling, Have held a poet's heart for thirty years! Not even the waves round English white cliffs dancing Allure me, like that sunlit land of thine: The land of silvery speech, and eyes swift-glancing, And limbs whose every movement seems divine. O dream-wrought flower which I shall never gather, Flower blossoming sweetly in those sunlit wilds, Take this, song's tribute,—nay, receive thou rather The man's love, even as thou hadst the child's! TO THE CZAR This poem was written in 1890, with the most passionate earnestness. I, therefore, retain it. But, at the same time, i think it well to say that I should not to-day write it, or fully endorse all the sentiments it contains. February, 1902. G. B. O thou who rulest by the might of legions, Lord of the snow-robed plains, the ice-bound sea, Hear thou man's word in far-off sunnier regions Spoken, the thought of thousands who are free. Deem'st thou thy millions trampled down for ages Will never rise in multitudinous scorn? God clothes thee in darkness, but no God engages That darkness shall not change to fiery morn. Blood cries for blood, and slaughter shrieks for slaughter; Man's dagger flashes back thy keen sword's light: Son seeks for sire, and father seeks for daughter; They win nor smile nor answer from the night. Lo!—with an Emperor's arms to seize and pinion— A woman dies beneath the ensanguined rod: Her cry, though stifled, rings through thy dominion,— Aye! past thy sky's cold starlight, up to God. Not only up to God,—man's soul has shivered With horror, hearing this accurséd thing: A woman's cry, as 'neath the lash she quivered King-smitten, becomes the death-knell of a king. Her cry is cry of triumph for the nations, For worn-out dynasties the trump of doom. It shall be heard by hearts of generations; Our women hear it from the Northland's gloom. Here, where our swordless task is but to listen Till Liberty speaks fully from her throne, 'Tis well to call to mind, while Spring's eyes glisten, That still in one land Winter holds its own; To call to mind that one, well born and cherished By many a friend ere this grim deed was done, At the flail's hundredth blood-stroke sank and perished Where Russia's dim vaults still defy the sun. And thou, whom darkness' sable wide wings sheltering Still shield from sword-thrust of the avenging light, Think'st thou that corpses in thy blind gaols weltering Can stain the flags, yet sully not the night? Construct thy walls of sound-proof stern ingredients!— Erect thy prisons in thy deserts lone!— Blood oozes out, for all thy royal expedients, And trickles Westward from thine hells of stone. The shrieks of thousands doubtless have been stifled: Thine iron-barred dungeons drip with tongueless gore: While gold-crowned dynasties have mocked or trifled, Man's blood has rippled on a voiceless shore. That strange Siberian snow-path, full of terror, Along whose dismal track the doomed feet go— Thousands, through royal crime or royal error, Have crimsoned with their blood the silent snow. Their suffering all seems wasted—wasted wholly Their agelong fierce defiance of the Czars: Still o'er that path the hapless troop winds slowly, And still the snow turns red beneath the stars. A hundred years have passed since, skyward flaming, The black French fortress owned man's conquest wrought; Confessed its hellish sins, its crimes past naming,— Born of kings' fancies, perished at man's thought. How many years will slowlier pass—not, surely, Another century—ere, gaunt wall by wall, Will flame to heaven the fort that holds securely Liberty bound—the prison of Peter-Paul? Or—better still—if thou, whose life is terror To thine own self, wouldst ere that stormy hour Fling wide the gates thy fathers closed in error And mix with reason's dreams thy dreams of power! What is thy life but anguish now?—immuring Thyself behind Gatschina's massy gates, 'Spite of ten thousand bribeless bolts securing, Thou shiverest if one rusty hinge but grates. Chief of a hundred millions, king-commander Of armies cumbering space with lance and plume, Thou art thyself imprisoned, Alexander,— Lord of the earth, yet penned within a room! The humblest child within thy vast dominions, Watching the free-winged swallow on the breeze Or the glad butterfly's untrammelled pinions, Is happier than the lord of lands and seas. The serf within his cottage calmly slumbers; He knows that, when he wakes, all will be well: But thou, whose guards are unimagined numbers, Art at the mercy of one fuse from hell. Summer brings nought of change; in every season Sedition's threats allow thee no repose;— May's flower-sweet air is rank with deadliest treason; Danger may lurk within the scented rose: The morning sun may guide the assassin's dagger; Aim may be trustier underneath the moon; Thou, watching the clear skies, mayest backward stagger Struck dead beneath the stars of fragrant June! Sole despot-ruler of a mighty nation, Yet art thou but the shadow of a king: Thou startest at a green leaf's palpitation, As the earth quakes at thy black eagle's wing. Lifting the gold cup to thy lips thou tremblest: Pause—what if subtlest poison should be there? In face of friends and foemen thou dissemblest; Long terror changed to white thine Empress' hair. Within the holiest church the bomb exploding, With splinters full of fiery tongues may cry, “Remember prisoners in damp cells corroding; Remember Bernstein choked to death—and die!” The knife may flash forth from the embroidered curtain: Thou, shuddering as thou see'st the cold steel shine, Mayest hear a voice that thunders, “Czar, be certain That Zotoff's bloodless veins must drink at thine!” Within the night pale countless ghosts surround thee: “Why tarry thus on earth?” their tongues exclaim; “Already as lord of hell our hands have crowned thee, Czar of the dungeons lit by ceaseless flame. “Priest of the torments in the realms infernal, Prince of the unmeasured leagues of sunless gloom, Pass thou from earth—thine empire is eternal Within the shades, thou Cæsar of the tomb!” POETRY AND SCIENCE Not all the suns that throng the soundless spaces Are worth the radiance of one loving heart: The least and humblest of all human faces Hath nobler import in the eyes of Art. Gaze through your glass till ye be stricken with blindness! Peer at the heavens whose bright star-clusters gleam! One human heart that glows with loving-kindness Outshines the stars, and makes your heavens a dream. Fair Science trumpets her own praise so loudly She fails to catch creation's under-tune; But listening Art, who walks the earth less proudly, Can hear—while Science quarries in the moon. What is it worth to know the leagues that sever Our green-grassed earth from Sirius or from Mars? The skies are lampless wastes, if we for ever Must cease to tell our fortunes by the stars! If darkness' doors were sundered, and we knew them, Gold star by star deploying from the deep,— If we could muster and rank by rank review them, Would it be worth one gift of white-armed Sleep? Love ruled the past, and love will rule the ages Unseen, unknown, the summers yet to be: In spite of Science' wand the storm-wind rages, But Venus' touch wrought magic on the sea. We need not Science' barge, slow-sailed and lumbering, To bear us o'er the ocean of the past; It is enough to know that earth, long slumbering, At love's touch woke to passionate life at last. I'd surely choose, had I the choice, to follow, When morning thrills the dazzled air with pride, Along heaven's heights the footsteps of Apollo Rather than Proctor's, though his path be wide. Of Grimm and Andersen no heart could weary; We turned to another when each tale was done: But now we yawn, and feel that earth grows dreary, While Norman Lockyer lectures on the sun. Give me the days of faith, and not of Science! Give me the days of faith in unseen things! The days of self-doubt, not of self-reliance: Days when the rainbow flashed from fairy wings. Knowledge hath little worth, if dreams are going. Let me watch in the stream the Naiad's hair; Or wander forth when balmy winds are blowing Through sunlit groves, and find sweet Daphne there. To know is well, but not to know is better. 'Tis ignorance that makes the child sublime. To learn new facts adds fetter unto fetter For all the already weary sons of time. We count the stars,—yet dream not what we are losing, Aye, losing all of us, the whole wise race, In that no more among the reed-beds musing Shall we see Pan's half-human wrinkled face. OLD LETTERS I. Letters mixed in strangest wild communion— Was there ever such a wondrous heap? There they lie, diverse, in seeming union: Some in faded brown ink, some in deep. Such a strange assortment! There, collected Through the ups and downs of twenty years, See them lying helpless,—disconnected From the old joys that filled them and the fears. Disconnected are they now for ever From the hopes and fears of early days. They will speak their ancient language never. Can November sing one song of May's? Can the winter with the spring hold parley? Can the wild red poppies as they gleam, Flashing through the wheat and tufted barley, Ever of the frozen furrows dream? No: to-day must face to-day's own troubles. Of the old sorrows, some have past away: Hopes have melted into air like bubbles; Golden dreams have darkened into grey. Ah! the twenty years, the myriad letters— Some that pierced my very soul with pain: Some that bound my heart in loving fetters (Would that we could wear those bonds again!) —Some from India, yet with memories in them Of the dear old Isis' grassy banks! If I once unfasten and begin them, Ghostly thoughts will rise in endless ranks; Thoughts of Oxford, of young days sun-lighted, Of the swift boats racing past the shore; Thoughts of early vows of friendship plighted: Sounds will echo as of wave and oar. If I open—Shall I open any? Dreams are sometimes very sweet indeed, Yet they weaken, when too sweet, too many; Undermine the present strength we need. II. Letters some there are in boyish seasons Written, when the unfeverish hours were fair; Long ere passion's tenderness and treasons Filled the skies of life with burning air. Letters written in the days of rapture, Days of merry gladness all unfeigned; Days when very heaven it was to capture Perch or roach, or whiting rosy-stained. Days when butterflies before us flaming Charmed us as with flash of fairy light, Robed in magic hues past mortal naming, Lustrous yellow, crimson, snowiest white. Letters some there are that breathe of passion. How their value lessens with the years! Now we estimate in sober fashion Sighs and kisses, burning words and tears. Passion doubtless had its truths to teach us: Sent from heaven, it teaches every one. Passion dies—we think no light can reach us— Yet God overtakes us with the sun. Stars and sun again for us are shining; All our sorrow darkens not the sea: “Mortal,” God saith, “while thou wast repining, See what treasures I kept back for thee! “While thou dreamedst that the world was over, Starlight, sunlight, storm and cloud and rain, Golden waving corn and crimson clover, All these came again and yet again. “Though thy sullen vision thou wast sealing, On the hedges miles of may were white: Through the silent darkness slowly stealing Came the moon, and silvered all the night. “Let thy dream of passion fade behind thee Like the tossing vapours seaward blown! Let my comfort breathed through nature find thee: While God liveth, thou art not alone.” III. Strange to think that all these hearts' outpouring Will so soon be ashes...if I burn! Thoughts that sought the blue sky wild and soaring: Love that made the answering spirit yearn. If I cast old letters in the ocean, Trust them to the boundless waves to keep, Will the waters thrill to man's emotion? Can I trust my treasures to the deep? If I fling them forth amid the clover Or the fields where countless daisies grow, Will the skylark care to con them over? Will the clouded yellow care to know? Here are letters full of love and tender, Love that made life's morning like a dream— Shall I cast them 'mid the golden splendour Of the buttercups beside the stream? Oft I think that sacred letters breathing Love of mother, sweetheart, trusty friend, Never ought to feel the hot flames wreathing Round them, ought to find a nobler end. Then I take the letters and I tear them Sadly, gently, tearfully maybe, And I let the loving west wind bear them, Little white-sailed fragments, out to sea! Or I cast them on the eddying river, Watch them floating downward, one by one. Some to starlight, trusting, I deliver: Some I give to morning and the sun. But I never can destroy quite tearless What has cost the writers love and pain. Letters of expostulation fearless, Through my soul your accents ring again! Letters some of love most sweet and simple (These I'll keep for ever, close to me!)— Not a fragment torn of these shall dimple Softest bosom of the sunniest sea. Even the buttercups shall never carry Fragments to their sister-flowers to read: Not one word of these shall ever tarry, Adding sweetness to the scented mead. While I tear—and sometimes not with sorrow— Here a poet's, there a thinker's words, These shall dwell with me for many a morrow, Sweet and simple as the notes of birds. Lo, this canon to the waves I scatter! Burn this maundering prelate in his pride! Rend this preacher's homily—small matter! Love is far too rare to fling aside. IV. But alas! some writers' souls have floated Farther than the letter-fragments sail. Noble spirits, faithful and devoted, Where are ye? Man's wondering thought turns pale. Farther than the stars that watch me read them Have the writers of some letters sped: Angel hearts, it may be, love and heed them, But for us they rank among the dead. Past the goals of mortal joy and anguish, Past our winters of the barren bough, Hours of storm or summer days that languish, Past all change of seasons are they now. Some whose power had vanished of discerning God behind his veil of purple air, God behind his sunset-raiment burning, God beyond the flowers he makes so fair,— These have travelled into viewless regions: Now, perhaps, God face to face they see, Find the deathland holds its living legions, Find how crowded is eternity. Much they suffered, these, while life enchained them. God, perhaps, whom they disdained to own, Generous more than they, has not disdained them, Given an audience unto each alone. Has not God in whom their hearts found pleasure, Though they called him by another name, Said to each with love no words may measure, “Heaven was very lonely till you came!” As I read their loving simple letters Oft I feel that though their creed was grim They have grown to-day beyond its fetters, Each has found God looking out for him. Each has found that if the soul beseech him Truly, in the tongue of any land, Ever will its urgent crying reach him, Ever will he stoop and understand. V. But—a sadder thought—some souls have wandered, Though among the living yet they be, Farther than the letter-fragments squandered On the billows roaring in from sea. Farther than the dead souls (love can perish Never, though the loving hearts be dumb)— Souls whom once our own souls loved to cherish, Whom we think of when the roses bloom: Whom we think of when the roses lavish Scented flying petals on the gale: Think of when the autumn wild winds ravish Crimson leaves that down the eddies sail. Farther than all thought or recollection Even—for their minds have grown apart: Death can bring deep sorrow and dejection, But it never quite dismays the heart. This dismays—that some are near us living, Close beside our threshold it may be, Whom we loved with all our power of giving, Yet between us rolls a bridgeless sea! Friends whose souls from ours the swift years sever, Friends whose love is lost in starless gloom, These indeed are lost to us for ever, Buried deeplier than in any tomb. SONNET TO ERNEST BIRCH O thou who through high Music's golden gate Hast right of entrance to the land divine Wherein the poets' crowns and sceptres shine, Thy coming we, Song's warders, celebrate. Thou art a poet-soul beyond debate:— Thy music thunders out like Milton's line: Thou canst describe in music and design; Thy music sighs forth love, or volleys hate. Poems are silent till thou layest thine hand Upon their chords. Lo! then the poems speak, And utter all their souls in music rare.— Thou dost interpret poets to their land, Adding the music-charm they vainly seek,— Making the fairest poem yet more fair. Feb. 23, 1887. TO SEPTEMBER I love the soft September days.— When summer's ardent life is done, I love to see the red leaves fall And know that death is lord of all; Lord of the green-grassed flowery ways, Lord even of the sun. As Wordsworth loved and worshipped May, I love the calm autumnal time. The gift most needed at the close Of this sad century is repose: Rapture was for a former day And for another's rhyme. As bright May cheers the buoyant soul And fills the glad with gladder thought, So thou, September, cheer'st my heart; For in this world all joys depart, And endless effort wins no goal And labour counts for nought. I love thee, pale September, well. The summer flaunted flower on flower And filled the hedges with its bloom, But thou, September, bringest gloom, And gloom is heaven and light is hell In this the world's dark hour. When Wordsworth sang his song to May, The world had hardly learnt to doubt— God smiled from heaven: he loved us all: Without his will no leaf could fall: But in this later darker day Despair has found us out. We realise that we may be, We human sufferers, quite alone: Created by no conscious will, Doomed to live on and suffer still, Without a heavenly eye to see Or ear to hear us groan. We realise that star on star May mock us from the depths of space, But that in star or moon or sun There may be none to aid us, none: In regions near or regions far No voice, no human face. We deem perhaps that human life Alone in our star buds and flowers, Here having been evolved alone: No whispers on the night-winds blown Bring messages of love or strife From other worlds than ours. But Wordsworth in that happier day Knew not that ere his century's close Dark doubt so deadly would arise. He watched the heavens with tranquil eyes, And sang his loving song to May And to the summer's rose. Ah! dark September suits us best. It meets our humour to behold The bright hues fade on flower and leaf: God knows we are most at home with grief, And in despair are most at rest! We and the age are old. So, sad September, I love thee: The lessening sunshine on the rills, The winds that toss the shuddering leaves, The wind-swept withered sedge that grieves, The chillier sunlight on the sea And on the darkening hills. AN EASTERN YEARNING Woman is part of Nature. She was born From the bright sea-wave. She and flowers are one. Can your cold Western culture e'er adorn Her who is taught by sea-waves and the sun? Oh, God deliver me from Western dreams! Give me warm moonlight on an Arab tent: Within, the touch that thrills, the glance that gleams; Soft bosom o'er me through the darkness bent. Then am I saved and crowned,—for bliss is there, And perfect bliss is heaven. Whate'er men say, I hold that God set stars within the air That mouth to mouth might find a readier way! Is this ignoble? More than sky or flower To love the glory of a woman's grace: To win eternal rapture in an hour, Life at her lips, and heaven in her embrace? Ever to find fresh shapely wonders shown (And beauty has unmeasured power to bless!)— Ever to come on some grand curve unknown, Some line of more than mortal loveliness? To feel—as ever it is deepliest felt At midmost thrilling of the close warm kiss— The sense of form throughout one's being melt, The sculptor's mingled with the lover's bliss? I hold that God made flowers that man might know That woman's beauty is a lovelier joy. Breathe wisdom on the petals—Down they go! Woman becomes an intellectual toy. Here in the West sweet womanhood is dead. Woman is master: mankind is the slave. Awestruck, the trembling spouse draws near her bed And claims the rights her condescension gave. But she is master, ruler of the West: The days of fragrant love have all gone by. Ah me, the olden days were far the best! There were more stars I think, then, in the sky. There was more tenderness in woman's heart, Less curséd Greek and Hebrew in her brain! Then all she knew (enough to know) of Art Was just the art man's passionate love to gain. THIS TIME LAST YEAR Lines written in Memory of Philip Bourke Marston This time last year, the sun and stars and sea, Which thou seeing not didst love, saw and loved thee; The world thou couldst not see beheld thee, friend: We saw the sightless eyes that saw no light,— To whom bright midday was eternal night, And moonlit clear skies moonless to the end. All things that heard thy song, rejoiced to hear; Thy singing made our dreary world less drear; Thou through thy darkness led'st us to the light: And yet that light thou sawest not. Even the sea That spake so many a wondrous word to thee Was never blue, the white rose was not white, The storm-cloud was not dark, the sky not fair, Nor golden-bright the flame-filled sunset air For thee, save only through thy sightless dream: Thou sawest not aught. Yet all things saw thee, friend; The stars and blossoms loved thee to the end; The blue sea loved thee, and the silver stream. And now, perchance—we know not—it may be— Thou dost behold in turn our poor blind sea That fails to apprehend thee where thou art: 'Tis we who are blind to-day,—yes, every one. Blind are our stars, our moonbeams, and our sun; Blind are our daisies with the golden heart. We cannot see thee. We are left in turn With loving souls and sightless eyes that yearn Towards that far land wherein thy foot has trod; Not yet can we behold what thou hast seen; Thou see'st us, it may be; perhaps dost lean Above our struggles like a helpful god. We know not. All is darkness where thou art. And yet, O poet with the true deep heart, Darkness to us may be strange light to thee; Thou who wast blind on earth mayest now behold Heaven's sky from east to west aflame with gold, Immortal morning on a deathless sea. July 23, 1887. FRUITLESS CREATION I retain this poem, written in or about 1890, as the very fact of its being based on so glaring and serious a mistake may perhaps render it of some value,—when the mistake is recognised and acknowledged. The mistake is, of course, that into which Tolstoy and so many earnest modern thinkers bave plunged headlong; the error of regarding physical love as in its essence degrading. It is the most dangerous error imaginable, leading straight back to all ascetic and monkish aberration, and involving the desecration of love and woman. If the “Woman” who speaks in the poem had confined herself to the advocacy of pure and exalted physical passion, she would have been wholly right, and might justly have claimed the support of the God who created those miracles of noble and beneficent design, the human love-organs. But, reacting against such pernicious heresies as those of Tolstoy, she confuses true with base passion, places herself in a seeming opposition to the God of love and nature, who is in fact so tenderly and lovingly on her side,—and thus puts herself wholly in the wrong. It seems necessary to-day to say this much in explanation of the poem. February, 1902. G. B. I. THE FIRST STAR Upon the stocks the first star-vessel waited. The bright prow flashed and gleamed. Within his soul the great Shipwright debated: He doubted, and he dreamed. “The ship is shaped. The masts and shrouds are ready: Its Builder's work is o'er. Soft river-waves around the gold bows eddy; It yearns to quit the shore. “Yet shall I launch it 'mid the wild commotion Of the outer air and sea? Can my star-ship withstand the fierce real ocean? Will it steer back to me? “When launched upon the seas of space exceeding All measurement and bound, Will it be lost? Will my star triumph, speeding O'er depths no lead can sound? “I hesitate. Shall I impart my being To others, less than I? Shall I send forth this star,—then watch it fleeing Lone through the unkindred sky? “The void is dark, and in the gloom is sweetness; Safety for it, for me. Shall I break up the lampless gloom's completeness, Saying to the first star: ‘Be’?” And then the Maker's soul within him reasoned: “If, when I make a sun, I deepen night; if good deeds must be seasoned With evil, every one; “If, when I send my winds to range the valleys And breathe forth peace and bliss, With passionate force they search the woods' green alleys, And ravish when they kiss; “If bluest waves must at the storm's hoarse bugle, Arrayed in furious white, Bay round the bows of labouring ships that struggle Through the stupendous night; “If, having made sweet love, divine and tender And full of purest bloom, Man must attack the flower, and mar its splendour, And plant lust in its room; “If woman, whom my thought would make resplendent, Whom I would grandly mould, Must change into man's slave, on man dependent, And sell her love for gold; “If this be so, let not my star-ship wrestle With life and space and time! Within some creek I had best lay up my vessel, Nor risk the voyage sublime.” So pondered God.—Then his resolve was taken. (With what result, we know.) God signalled with his hand,—with voice unshaken Said to the first star: “Go.” II. THE LAST STAR The thought of God had flowed for years past numbering Into the facts of time. Through age on age God watched, with gaze unslumbering, Sorrow and sin and crime. God watched the grief that follows first love's rapture: From his great throne in space He watched maybe some city's blood-stained capture, Or death-throes of a race. He saw the dead beneath his white moons lying; He heard gaunt lions roar: He heard the groans and curses of the dying; He heard ships strike the shore. He marked the doom that weighs down all creation; He saw love change to shame: He saw death sweep the stars with devastation; He saw hell's leaping flame. He saw love's bloom forsake each woman's features, As old in turn they grew: He saw disease waste millions of his creatures: He saw the leper's hue. He saw faith seize its victims and devour them; He saw mad hatred rage: He saw pure women strive, man's lusts deflower them, From darkling age to age. He sent his Sons. To star on star he sent them, Love's messengers sublime. Mad unbelief rose, armed to circumvent them: Death conquered them, and time. He sent his eldest Son to one doomed city: But him the people slew. Man steeled his heart against Christ's tender pity, And so man's sorrow grew. Ever the same! As Christ was born of Mary, So other Christs were born. Their various fates in one point did not vary; Each Christ was crowned with thorn. If in nought else the vast star-hosts resemble Each other, all alike Smote their own Christs with hands that did not tremble, And lifted spears to strike. Wherever genius, born of God and woman, Flashed on a world's dim way, Its fellow-beings strove with hate inhuman To quench the genius-ray. Wherever God appeared, in seer or poet, Satan appeared as well. God's hand, revealing heaven, disclosed below it The yawning gulfs of hell. God pondered long.—Then his resolve was taken. The heavens in darkness deep He wrapped. The voice that bade the first star waken Said to the last star: “Sleep.” III. THE SECOND PARADISE Yet, ere that star was quite destroyed, A tenderer thought of pity came: God would not leave the heavens quite void; There still should burn one beacon-flame. One star should still through leagues of gloom Fling light, though all stars else were dead. For countless mighty suns a tomb! For one small star new birth instead! For one small star another day, And for two human beings as well More life to use, or fling away; A grander heaven, or deeper hell. “For”—thus God said—“two I will choose, The sole survivors these shall be: For mine own purpose I will use This rearguard of humanity. “They shall rule o'er their star alone, Lords of its wastes of wood and plain: The whole wide earth shall be their throne, Their vast impregnable domain. “The past shall perish. Not a sign Shall testify of ancient hours. No ghosts of dead cold stars shall shine, Nor pale ghosts of forgotten flowers. “All shall be new. Aye, once again An Adam and an Eve shall be Sole in the glory of their reign O'er silent earth and sailless sea. “And these shall love me. I shall find In these the recompence I sought In vain, in vain, amid mankind, Born of mine unripe earlier thought. “Man failed, and woman failed as well: I sweep the whole race to their tomb. Man staggered, woman wholly fell; Tearless, I leave them to their doom. “Two spotless spirits alone I save: These two shall carry out my plan; Shall live, and grow beyond the grave To perfect woman, perfect man. “But let their love be holy and chaste! On this one point the whole depends: Let not love's image be defaced, Disfigured, for ignoble ends. “Let them develope onward, up From man to angel, but abstain From quenching at wild passion's cup A thirst whose quenching is not gain. “Let passion perish,—passion slew The whole primeval world indeed! Now I would make all wholly new, And gift man with a nobler creed. “Grow on to angelhood,—disdain To recreate the lower type Upon this sorrowing earth again: Your star for higher forms is ripe.” IV. THE SECOND FALL The Man. I am as Adam, thou art Eve; we stand Lonely at last upon a lonely star. The lot of those who peopled earth was grand, But our dispeopling doom is grander far. We form the first link with a higher race: All earth's old passions vanish into air. I see the dawning angel in thy face; I mark heaven's halo brightening round thy hair. We, letting all old instincts fade and flee, Dismissing all that marred the race's powers, Shall add new glory to an unknown sea, Mix tenderer fragrance with the unborn flowers. For every blossom suffered at the birth Of sin,—the fields took on a sombre hue: Gladness forsook the green old festive earth; The waves grew grey that once were joyous blue. Love has to answer for the stormy past: Love, guided well by woman's traitorous hand, Has wrecked the stars—till this, the very last, On which to-day with lonely feet we stand. Thou art the culprit,—thou, with eyes so sweet And lips that seem like pure half-opened flowers, Hast forced the world's Creator to retreat: The power to extinguish love at last is ours! The Woman. Nay! 'tis the power to make a new beginning That's ours, to shed new splendour o'er the sea. If love be sin, then very sweet is sinning: Sin shall endure throughout eternity. Was ever rose less pure in that it nestled, Luxuriant, on some bosom warm and white? When God with Chaos' ebon darkness wrestled, It was to give love never-ending light. Was ever star less brilliant at the casement, Has ever moon with lesser lustre gleamed, Watching some lover in sweet first amazement Kissing the lips of which for years he dreamed? Wilt thou resume with speechless exultation The passionate raptures of past years untold, See in my eyes the love-looks of a nation, A century's sunshine in my hair of gold? The flowers of all the past, the loves resplendent That starlike lit old cities, hills, and plains, Are all for thee,—on thee they wait attendant: Lo! Cleopatra burns within my veins. Holding my hand, quite fearless thou mayest enter Strange bowers of love in many a far-off place: For thee shall Fate with ardent touch concentre All beauty in one incomparable face. Wilt thou consent to make me mighty mother Of timeless generations yet to arise? Adam begat one world—beget another! Make fruitful all the dark womb of the skies! Be father of the years beyond man's numbering; Propel afresh the life-throbs of the race Along the channels where life pauses, slumbering: Behold new starlight, gazing on my face! Wilt thou consent, O mortal, firm, unfearing, To crowd the lifeless heaven that o'er us gleams With fleets of planets through the dark waves steering, Lord of a kingdom mocking mortal dreams? This thou canst do, and more,—the moment fateful, August and solemn, calls thee to decide. Above us loom vast starless heavens and hateful: Around us stretch lone lifeless fields and wide. Trust thou the power of fatherhood residing Within thy soul to me—Disperse the gloom! The winds of winter look to thee for guiding: Raise the dead summers from their darkling tomb. Lo! at thy word the June-days bright and burning Shall flash their spears once more against the sun: Within new lovers' hearts shall wake the old yearning; Win me! even so our daughters shall be won. New buoyant springs, whose young hearts leap for gladness, Shall fill the warm pure air with scent of may: New autumns, full of soft and tremulous sadness, Feel at love's touch that sadness melt away. Thou shalt be lord of all the circling seasons; Lord of the summer, as of winter's snows: Ruler and lord of all the dark sea's treasons; Lord of the love that beckons from the rose. Thou, the creator of the new world's rapture, Shalt share the passionate life that is to be: Preside, it may be, at some new Troy's capture, Hold the steep pass at some Thermopylæ. New cities shall be thine, new Londons greet thee; New fiercer life than that which throbbed of old Along the madding streets surge round thee and meet thee; New sunsets tinge their skies with stormier gold. Aye, like the waves of their own seas let nations Rise into light, flash high, then disappear,— Calm joys succeed to stormy tribulations, And golden springs to many a snow-clad year. New poets, mightier than the great who slumber, Through the broad portals of the years shall move: But all shall sing of me,—of all their number Thorn-crowned, sin-marred, not one shall fail to love. Music shall seek the skies, a form imperial: But, as more skilled time's strong musicians grow, Still must love render the wild strings ethereal; I sway them, whether their hearts will or no. New sculptors, marble-moulding, still for ever Their heavenliest impulse from my form shall take. Shall one curve pass from human memory? Never! Dead marble shall be deathless for my sake. Anew the vast cathedrals where love sleeping Waited love's longed-for resurrection morn Shall rise, and hear the sound of women weeping, The passionate prayers of races yet unborn. With kingly wealth impassioned Art combining Shall raise bright palaces in many a land: But ever love's shall be the heart designing, And love's the shaping and adorning hand. Nought shall evade us! by this sweet transgression, This sin superb, if sin indeed it be, We shall for ever stamp our own impression On stars and sun, and towns and hills and sea. Nor only heaven again in all its glory Thou shalt compel time's hand to recreate: Thou shalt rewrite the legend, the fierce story, Of hell,—reprint man's epic poem of hate. Again shall Torquemada's spirit sinister Flash forth upon the world, blood-stained yet grand; Ambassador for God, yet Satan's minister, Climbing the stairs of heaven with dripping hand. Again shall many a prelate's voice of thunder Proclaim his own flock saved, the heathen doomed. At hell's Bastille again shall sweet love wonder, And weep for thousands in its vaults entombed. Again shall man, invincible, eternal, With thousand-throated laugh of mocking scorn Roll back the gates barred by the hands infernal, And flood night's dungeons with the sunlit morn. Again shall battle's fierce throbs course and tingle Through ardent souls on many a future sea: Again smoke-vomiting iron fleets commingle;— Their guns await one signal-flash from thee! Thou hast to speak the word that hurls an ocean Of sword-points at some far-off Waterloo Against calm squares: thine is the intense emotion Of combat, ever-fierce and ever-new. Thine is the fury of battle—thine for ever Love's pleasure; young lips pause at lips most sweet,— Apart, they wait thy mandate.—Wilt thou never Speak the one radiant word that bids them meet? Thou hast the power to bid wild passion waken; The power to bid great countless stars arise Upon the night wherethrough with heart unshaken The maid who seeks her lover peers and flies. Hand thrills not hand till thou dost join them—never Without thy will can one love-deed be done. Thou canst blindfold the watchers,—thou for ever Canst bring sweet darkness, and blindfold the sun. The woman tremulous in her moonless chamber Dreads lest love's foot i'the darkness go astray: But thou canst light love's lamp of golden-amber, The summer moon that shows love's foot the way. Thou hast the power to unbar the morning's portal: Thou canst restore the sun's kiss to the wave. Love, slain by Fate, will rise up, vast, immortal, If thou wilt summon Love's form from the grave. Say to the drowséd waters, turning seaward, “Awake!”—to heaven say, “Let the darkness flee!” Scatter the soul's deep darkness, turning meward: Lift up thine eyes, thy princely face, on me. Wilt thou consent to be the king-creator On whom the eyes of the ages shall be bent,— Wilt thou, my slave, be to all else dictator,— Wilt thou consent to love me? The Man. I consent. DEAD FLOWERS A tuft of mignonette, a withered rose! Numberless foolish hearts have treasured such. Now, as I lift them from their long repose, They turn to dust and crumble at a touch— Poor flowers that meant so much! They meant—pure love and limitless belief In summer's faithfulness, in sunny skies: They mean—one lonely pang of silent grief, Just one true tear that in a moment dries, For even sorrow dies. So with the millions who have hoarded flowers: The frail love-token lasts, the heart's love goes. Man's vaunted strength and woman's boasted powers Are more ephemeral even than the rose, The frailest flower that blows! A withered rose, a tuft of mignonette— How passing weak must be the human heart, For these outlive even love, outlast regret, Abide even when grim pain, with blunted dart, Makes ready to depart. THE SINGERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY When the twentieth century fadeth, when the dusk is round it closing fast, When it hears each singer sadly, knowing that each song may be the last; Will the singers it remembers, glancing back along the years of bloom, Be diviner than the singers chanting through our century's sun and gloom? What strange wars and tribulations will the far-off voices have to sing! Creeds and thrones of newer peoples: flowers of many another laughing spring: Sunrise over many a cornfield red with battle's blood-stains, it may be: Moonlight over wastes of breakers, hideous shipwreck on full many a sea: Love in many a grove and bower, burning love with many an honeyed word— Love whose message old as history seems half whispered, never fully heard: Love co-equal with the ages—love who though his singers fail and pass Is as young as woman's beauty, or the dew-spheres on the morning grass. Yet though grand the future singers, stately though their march of music be, Our strange century hath been gladdened; woodland green and lake and silver sea, These have heard our century's singers. What glad faces shone beneath the light Of the passionate early morning, when the fields of Europe rang with fight! Far-off, very far, it seemeth. Close beside those early singers stood Blood-smeared wild-eyed Revolution, and her spirit mingled with their mood. Something of her ardent message Wordsworth, Shelley, Byron, Coleridge, caught: Somewhat of her fiery nature wove itself within their inmost thought. But the mountains soon from Wordsworth hid the red and blood-streaked dawn of day: To his spirit Revolution had but one pale far-off word to say. Then he turned with growing rapture to the valleys' calm, the mountains' might; Rested 'mid the solemn silence of the countless starlit peaks by night: Chose amid the hills to ponder rather on the great Creator's plan Than to hear mad Paris thunder from her cannon-throats the rights of man: Chose to hear the wild streams murmur, chose to watch the flashing waters gleam, Joining in the green fields' gladness, sharing in the mountains' lonely dream. Grey-haired venerable Landor full or classic passion lived and died: Strong-browed drama-moulding Browning won our womanpoet for his bride. She too was this century's singer,—she who into deathless music wrought All the wealth of woman's passion, all man's sober strength of weightier thought; She who taught the world for ever what a power resides in woman's soul When the brain is there to guide it, and the sovereign genius to control. Shelley, too, divinely laboured—made the half of life a lyric dream; Into music wove the moonlight, made in song a lovelier starlight gleam: Made in verse the blossoms fairer, poured a nobler light on hill and plain; Built in song a lyric Eden, brought to Adam spotless Eve again. And he showed in noble drama, dealing with the old tale of deadly wrong, That his hand could wield the lightning, not alone the lyre of loveliest song. Later on our brother singers fought their battle vast beyond the wave: Longfellow and Whittier struggled, hurling slavery to its blood-red grave. Now at last the slave is chainless, through their power of brain and force of heart: Lowell, Bryant, countless others—nobly each one played a giant's part. Poe with mystic sweetness murmured—left us lyrics time's touch may not wrong: Whitman spake but half his message, failing through the immenseness of his song; Failing through his very largeness of desire co-equal with the land —Left a vast work unaccomplished, waiting for some even mightier hand. Far in France Love found a singer, in whose rich voluptuous song should be Somewhat of its own strange music—somewhat of Love's own eternity: And the singer's heart responded, feeling Love's fair beauty overmuch, Feeling all things else ephemeral, just mere foam-bells melting at the touch: Love to Musset was so lovely that the whole world brightened at its feet; When love passed the whole world darkened, when it vanished nothing else was sweet. Yet for ever bears he witness what the world is like in love's first hour: We may win the fruit he won not, for he never sought beyond the flower. We may see the soul he saw not fill the eyes of love with deathless light: We may see the stars he saw not lift its veil of darkness from the night. In the dawning of the era swift-eyed, seeing, the laurelled singers rose: But the God-endowed blind singer, pale and patient, waited for its close. Never yet the rolling waters held more might of colour than they hold, Marston, in thy deep rich music; there the sunset breathes and burns with gold. Was the tender heart of poet ever filled with tenderer sweeter things? In thy song the roses whisper, heard of thee the “garden fairy” sings. Lonely, many waited for thee—blind, that thou mightest give them eyes to see: Jealous flowers and hills and rivers left forlorn by Shelley looked to thee; All the unsung heart of Nature, many a voiceless lake and silent stream:— Many a star no singer heeded through thy music flashed its infant gleam. For the whole of Nature never, bridelike, conquered by a single bard, Kissed his lips and stood before him, loosed her purple deep hair golden-starred. If the whole of Nature truly were one bride for one great king of song, Would not kingly Victor Hugo lure her coy reluctant feet along? Would not she the spirit of Nature who was girlish, young, when Shelley came, Meet, mature, the century's singer, Hugo,—wreathe his brows with fadeless fame? Other singers win the kisses of the flowers her handmaids sweet and white: But for him her voice of ocean sounds, and calls him towards her through the night. He, the giant message hearing, leaves all friends and passes forth alone, Knowing that the woman calls him, Nature, to be sharer of her throne: Knowing that while other singers worship at her altar, then depart, He may watch her eyes for ever, he the lord and ruler of her heart. Yet the age hath room for others. When the chant of Wordsworth waxéd old Tennyson, most English-hearted, sang to English cliff and English wold. His the message not of ocean, not the kiss that floats across the sea; His the calm heart of the valleys, filled with many a flower and golden tree: His all English women's beauty, and the sweetness of our rose-hung lanes, And the lovelier perfect sweetness that in English women's hearts remains: His the glory of the combat, clash of splintering spear and ringing shield, Courteous strife of many a tourney, fiery strife of many a blood-stained field. Fame of battle's wild narration, crown of martial verse, with Scott he shares— Scott, through whom mankind for ever breathes the sweetness of the mountain-airs: Scott, through whom mankind for ever hears the ancient border minstrels sing, Tweed “repine” and Teviot murmur, and a thousand mountain-runnels ring: Scott, through whom the world for ever grasps the grandeur of the feudal time; Learns to love the grey old castles, grey with clambering lichen, red with crime. At the feet of Europe's monarchs Danton in his huge Titanic mirth Flung the head of Louis bleeding. Then another era dawned on earth. But two singers scorned the era, turned away with eager hearts and eyes; Scott resought his grey old castles, Morris dreamed beneath far sunny skies. Morris took the Greek wise legends,—made us hear through London's dreary roar Witch Medea's luring laughter, and the wave that leaped from Jason's oar: Sang to us wild Northern Sagas, many a weird old chant and mythic rune; Made us love the Volsung Legend, love the grey-eyed wondrous queen Gudrun: Made us with Pygmalion marvel as the white stone grew to woman's form,— Cold eyes flashing into sunlight, marble changing into bosom warm: Made us feel with Galatea what the glory of passion ought to be; Made her break time's marble silence once, and then reseek eternity. Matthew Arnold felt the Zeit-Geist bear him into regions cold and dim; Faith was only for the weak-brained, not the clear-souled poet—not for him. All our century's sadness smote him: Science ruled him, ruled him to the last, Though the Church enchained his father, loyal-souled, the servant of the past. Never more would sign or portent—so the poet's keen-edged tongue proclaimed— Flash upon a world turned sceptic, of faith's earlier follies grown ashamed. Yet how brightly blossoms glitter, here and there, through his world-weary thought! Gems of love and jewels of fancy that the poet's happier genius wrought. So with Clough—the grim doubt seized him, drew him forth from sweet faith's golden shore: This alone he knew for certain—that the old hope could avail no more. Not with Kingsley—he for ever, casting logic's dead weight overboard, Held to the old faith, stern and stedfast; knotty points he settled—with his sword. Fearless noble deathless singer! while his England still confronts the sea Eyes shall soften, hearts shall tremble, at the pathos of the “Sands of Dee.” Would he had written a thousand ballads!—even when he wore the bonds of prose Brighter gleamed the ferns of Devon, lovelier colour glittered in the rose. Round him thronged the Elizabethans, grand old worthies of the heroic time; Is not “Westward Ho!” a poem rich in music though it lacks a rhyme? Rhyming subtly came Rossetti—he who with the Italian music-force Re-imbued the English sonnet, gave the sonnet-stream an altered course. Many a soul in many a sonnet, many a burst of lyric rapture, strove Passion's tenderest lore to utter, stars to ravish from the brow of love: He, with mightier touch, for ever in one sonnet sealed the depth, the height, Sweetness, strangeness, awe of passion, all the mystery of the nuptial night. Can there be a greater glory than this crown man's judgment hath conferred? Even that, singing after Shakespeare, still Rossetti spake a wanting word. Edwin Arnold's “Light of Asia” turned our eyes from English bowers of green, Turned our thoughts from strife of moderns, from our Europe's over-crowded scene; From the clash of sects and parties, all that makes our Western life a storm,— Set before us in the old sunlight, calm and restful, Buddha's princely form. Generations pale and vanish—stars that now are old were fair and young When that “Light” shone forth resplendent which the poet of to-day has sung. Somewhat as of Buddha's greatness, somewhat of his strength that cannot cease, Fills his singer's soul that points us past the storms of time to timeless peace: Peace that reigned in the early ages, ere our Western warrior-life begun; Peace,—and Arnold's song resumes it, full of light and fervent with the sun But the century hath another whom the thunder crowned and sought for bard; Whom the lightning kissed, and loved him; for whose soul the sea-wind wrestled hard. Byron! still the lonely Jura seeks thee, widowed, weary,— and her sighs Rolling through the rolling thunder find no kindred heart nor song-replies: Unto thee, as unto Musset, passion was the gift of perfect worth, Light of woman's eyes the loveliest light that left the heaven and sought the earth: Unto thee—not unto Musset—was the dark-blue ocean-waste divine; Through thy song a thousand wave-crests curl and sparkle, rise and leap and shine. Yet the wild sea's stormy message through a younger fiery singer thrills, And his heart hath caught the rapture somewhat of the green far foam-flecked hills. Swinburne! somewhat of the eternal might and wrath and rapture of the sea Through thy sealike song hath sounded, somewhat of the soul of all things free: And the heart of many a goddess left forlorn through many a weary day Dares to glance up, and rejoices hearing the old note within thy lay. Bowed and full of desolation was full many a goddess' golden head When along the viewless valleys rang the news that bright-souled Keats was dead: Eyes long dry and tearless wept him, pale was Venus watching at his tomb, Stars put off their robes of splendour, and for years no rose won all its bloom. Now the gods shake off their mourning. Lo! again the trembling water glows Round about the form of Venus, wakeful after over-long repose: Once again a lovelier music than the music of our hills and streams Brings again the thought of Sappho, thrills the evening with the morning's dreams. Yet a note of sadness mingles with our song that praises these who sing. All must pass. One century forward, just as blue shall gleam the swallow's wing. Pink the early almond-blossom still amid the branches brown shall shine, And the bees shall hum for ever through the ivy and round about the vine. One live flower shall have the magic all dead things and bloodless to surpass: Who can dream on dead pale singers, when the kingcups glitter through the grass? Who will ponder on our singing, when the very queen of song is there? We may sing of passion's sweetness, but the songless lips will find it fair. All our crowns of blood-stained laurel are not worth the crown the maiden brings, Giving passion to her lover, giving but one glance to him who sings. Though our singing live for ever, little is our sweetest singing worth; Deathless value is in the love-song of the glad old everlasting earth. Deathless glory is in the love-song of the blue old everlasting seas: Endless sweetness in the chanting of the pure fatigueless mountain-breeze. We shall pass, but love shall linger,—linger while the golden mornings gleam; Linger while the last white lily tells its love-tale to the listening stream. We shall pass, but love shall linger while the light in woman's eyes is young, Fair as if no soul had seen it, undescribed as if no soul had sung. Ghosts may wander through the starlight, ghosts of poets crowned with phantom bays; All dead songs shall miss the magic of one thoughtless throstle's living lays. Every night the night's star thrilleth at the marriage-message of the sea: What grows old and grey in Nature? Nought that Nature fashions; only we. Not more snowy was the primal than last April's dazzling chestnut-bloom: Bright last night the star-hosts glittered, bright as when they flashed on Eden's gloom. Round about each new-born poet arms most white his virgin era flings: “Never have I heard sweet singing”—so she whispers to the soul that sings. “Never have I owned a lover!” so she says with glance half shy, half wild: “What is love?” she whispers gently, nestling closer like a loving child. “What is love?” she whispers softly,—and will whisper while the starlit deep Watches over woman's beauty, passion's flower, and fragrant-bosomed sleep. LOVE'S PLEADING If you love me, love of mine, Let me feel it day by day! Never take the light divine Of your tender love away! Let me feel it when we meet, By the joy that fills my heart Making every moment sweet; By my sorrow, when we part. Let me feel that you are mine, When the autumn leaves alight; When the suns of summer shine; When the stars begem the night. Let me feel it hour by hour, As the seasons come and go: When the golden kingcups flower; When the fields are white with snow. Let me feel it in your hand; Let me see it in your eyes: —Then will sky and sea and land Gleam with light of Paradise. Let me hear it in your voice! Let me know that love is there, Bidding all my heart rejoice, Casting out a life's despair. Let me feel that love will last Though the seasons fade and wane: That, when Time itself is past, Love will store its golden grain. Though the restless waves may chafe, Though the storm-wind smite the shore, Let me feel that love is safe, Far beyond the billows' roar! Let me, as time onward flows Stealing sunshine from the air, Stealing colour from the rose, Stealing blackness from your hair,— Let me, as the days depart, Feel you growing through the days Ever dearer to my heart, Ever fairer to my gaze. Let me feel that, when we met, That was life's propitious hour. Though Time's sickle may be set To the grass-blade and the flower, Let me, darling, know that you Dwelling in love's sunnier clime, Where the skies are ever blue, Are beyond the reach of Time. Let me find—when dart on dart Strikes me, giving little rest— Perfect refuge in thine heart, Holiest haven on thy breast! Let me, when with hate increased All the world's one hostile line, Feel that one sweet heart at least Beats in unison with mine. Let me feel that all that's best In my life to thee I owe; Aye, and every hour most blest Of my seasons here below. What in me is good and pure —If some stray pure thoughts there be— What of life's work may endure, True love, all I owe to thee. Let me feel, if all forsake, One is true for evermore. When the lonely wild waves break All along life's lonely shore, Let me feel, if thou art there, With thy faithful hand in mine, That in thousands through the air All the stars of summer shine. Be on earth my perfect queen, Tender, loving, helpful, fond; Lead me past things felt and seen To our unseen home beyond. Let the mystery in thine eyes Ever sacred presage be, Of a light beyond the skies, Of a land we cannot see. Help me onward day by day; When my weary thoughts despair, Soothe my weariness and say, “Wait till night. The stars are there!” When my restless thoughts repine Longing that the night be done, Whisper, with thy hand in mine, “Wait till morning brings the sun.” So for ever be my guide. Weary was I, sad, alone— All the world I had defied, But I bent to thee, my own. Haughty helm and vengeful sword At thy word I flung away: Ceased from hatred, and adored; Half remembered how to pray. Teach me to be true and strong, Brave and humble, pure and glad: Let thy soul inspire my song; Let my soul no more be sad. Change my hatred of the world Into perfect love of thee, As the river onward hurled Calms its wild wave in the sea. Change my dark despairing soul; Lead my thoughts towards peace and rest. Lo! in thee I find my goal; Lo! at thee I end my quest. Let me feel that thou art mine— Gentlest, thou, of all things born: Let me feel that I am thine— I, whose very breath was scorn. Lead me slowly through the love, Changeless, vast, I give to thee, Back to hope, if so it prove; On to heaven, if this may be. When this fleeting life is past, Past its suns that set and rise Lead me, angel-love, at last Back with thee to Paradise! “AMONG THE WILDWOOD BOWERS” The sun streamed over vale and hill, How joyous all things seemed! Far in the distance, clear and still, The yellow cornfields gleamed. Fair was the summer land; I held in mine your hand; Your eyes drew mine, and in their depths I dreamed, Holding in mine your hand! Then, on another golden day, Among the wildwood bowers, Love had its golden word to say The while we gathered flowers. “O love, my heart is thine; Be thou for ever mine; Life's loveliest purest gifts will all be ours, If thou art ever mine!” In what far other land than this, Beneath what heavenly sky, Shall we with wild undreamed-of bliss Meet, sweetheart, you and I? In what far other land Shall we together stand, Past death, past pain and parting, by and bye,— In what far other land? LOVE'S GIFTS The bright blue wave were sad and drear Without its sea-bird white: The rose would die, did it not hear The soft breeze sing at night: Lest heaven should be the storm-wind's prey, Love made the grand sun shine: Lest clouds should cover all my day, He made thy splendour mine! Love sent the sweetest thing on earth To charm me and to chain; To thrill my soul to tenderest mirth, Or—pierce my heart with pain! Love bade the blue sea kiss the land, The gold shore kiss the sea, Then made the marvel of thine hand, And brought my queen to me. FAREWELL! When morning comes, the last pale star Must crowd all sail and flee: The wave that leaps the harbour-bar Says “Farewell” to the sea. The violet in the hollow lane May long to linger there: Nay, it must pass! The golden grain Must leave the furrows bare. “Farewell!” they say, “Adieu!” they cry, All sweet sad earthly things: The loveliest sun-kissed rose must die; The swallow spreads her wings. The crocus with its golden smile Must vanish from the grass: The tulip tarries for awhile, And then it too must pass. Farewell! farewell!—the saddest cry That ever earth has heard: So says the sunset to the sky, The green bough to the bird. So says the rainbow to the spray, The linnet to her nest; So says the dying summer day Unto the mountain's crest. So many golden hours we've known, May know so many yet; We've seen the sun ascend his throne, Have watched the same sun set: Will there be one last hour of all? Last hour of summer bloom, Last green leaf trembling to its fall, Last roseleaf to its doom? Oh sweetheart, must we say “Farewell”? Will all be over soon? Will that green pathway through the dell With dying leaves be strewn? —Life's vessel glides away so fast, Away from you and me: We saw the hull—we see the mast— That soon we shall not see! “THE SWEETEST LOVE IS OVER” I. The sweetest love is over This world has ever seen. No more am I your lover! No more are you my queen! The stars are in the sky, love, They glitter as of old: Starless are you and I, love,— Our heavens are dark and cold. Oh, if you had been true, love, We could have conquered pain! My whole soul trusted you, love —It will not trust again. The flowers again will brighten At Spring's swift loving tread, The waves will leap and lighten, But oh, my heart is dead! It was so little, surely— I asked so little, dear; That you should love me purely, And be my true love here. I loved in man's strong fashion, And valued far above The sweetest gifts of passion The simplest gift of love. The tenderest love is over That life has ever seen. No more am I your lover! No more are you my queen! The stars in heaven are shining; Not one star shines for me! There is no light for me to-night— Oh, what light can there be? II. A boundless darkness covers, Gloom utter and complete, The souls of us—two lovers Who once found sunlight sweet. The gloom is full of terror, The terror full of pain: Somewhere there has been error, Mistake,—that much is plain. Misunderstanding ghastly, Oh, this there must have been! Satan has triumphed vastly, And stolen away my queen. By means most strange and stealthy The cruel deed was wrought: Love deemed himself so wealthy; Lo! Love possesses nought. Love stays you not with yearning, Arrests you not by prayer. You pass a sudden turning— Your figure is not there. I strain my eyes in wonder; Nought is there to behold. We twain are leagues asunder, Who were one heart of old. Of all love's bloom and splendour What relic will there be?— Not even one message tender! Not even a look for me! “Lost!” “lost!” the wail of sadness Goes shivering through my heart. We met in perfect gladness: In hopeless pain we part. LOVE'S CHOICE Because I feel that I cannot forget, I thank thee, Lord!—Because for ever now My eyes will meet the sinless eyes I met, And see the dark hair shade a sinless brow: Because, though she is dead,—aye, dead in shame, Polluted through the villany of one Who, lusting, did in love's dishonoured name The meanest deed that ever on earth was done; Because, though she be lost, she for whose sake I would have gone with singing to my tomb, I think of her...as even the ice-bound lake Dreams of green banks divine with summer's bloom: Because I think of her, so sweet and pure And tender—ere the villany of man Spread forth its cautious net, its cunning lure, And ended darkly what in light began: Because I still can see within her eyes The light of very heaven as once it gleamed; Because my heart, though in hell's depth it lies, Will dream for ever as at first it dreamed: Because the past is with me evermore; Because love is in me a changeless thing; Because the blue waves may forsake the shore, Green leaves forget to deck the brow of Spring— Because there is in me no power to change, Because my pain is everlasting, Lord, I thank thee with a passion grim and strange:— My love thou slayest not with thy keen-edged sword. If thou couldst change despair to joy of heart, Then would there be no story of love to tell! Love bids all untrue comforters depart, And lest in heaven it falter, chooses hell. A POET'S VENGEANCE I. This is my vengeance—not to take away My love, to leave it with you to the end: To speak to you, when flowers are fair; When starlight glistens, to be there; From the blue spotless summer skies to bend. I may not speak in weak words? I can pray. Pray that the higher self I would have died To reach, and at its highest point to keep, May ever, guided by God's hand, Develope, blossom, grow, expand: Pray that the fruits my hand may never reap May fill God's fostering heart with joy and pride. True, the pure freshness of our love is lost. Your dagger smote (ah! if it had but slain)— The blow was cowardly, mean and base: You should have struck before my face,— I would have said, “Smite on—yea, smite again!” But you—you struck when I was trusting most. I trusted you, as man might trust his heart To God his Maker—gave you love supreme. For years I laboured night and day And only ceased from love, to pray: I made your life for years a happy dream: I crowned you with the laurels of my Art. I would have loved you to the very end: I would have shielded you from all things sad. But you—you turned away to seek False love, unfaithful, foolish, weak, Perverse, half blind it may be, wholly mad; For one hour's pleasure you destroyed a friend. You chose the lesser love, the meaner heart: The nobler loving heart you crucified. I gave you heaven: you gave me hell: Was this thing womanly or well? You let the base man win you for his bride, And bade the true strong husband-spirit depart. Now do I curse you? No: nor do I bless. There is a living God in all these things. God shall do justice to the twain: In his safe hands I place my pain: We both must face the judgment sure time brings; In one way love will deepen, not grow less. In this way: love is truth, and truth must be For ever now between us—that is clear. All lies are o'er, they could not last; The untruth is buried in our past;— You love me, or you do not love me, dear: We have to face the future—we shall see! Your soul will grow, or not grow. If it grows, There yet might be on some far future day Peace for our spirits, autumnal rest, A wedded calm in either breast (This is the nobler end for which I pray: Not passion's rapture—rapture of repose). Aye once again, if you could be quite true, True-souled and pure through all eternity, Some happiness my heart might win,— Some day I might forget the sin; I might hear glad birds singing, and the sea Might even regain for me some note of blue. But if your soul will grow not—If it still Lingers as this man's plaything through the years,— If you, a poet's love, his queen, Can wholly choose a thing so mean,— If you forget love's kisses, aye love's tears,— If nothing now can move your nobler will,— If, having once been loved with love most fair, Most strong, most sweet, most gentle, you to-day Can wholly turn your face aside, Why then your true soul must have died! Then God and love and I must turn away: I meet God's eyes, and in them is despair. Yes: if a woman's heart can quite forget The countless happy moments that we shared, If six years are as nothing, then Indeed the creed of vulgar men Would seem like truth—if you too can be snared By diamonds glittering through a golden net. II. But if the nobler course may still be ours, If you to whom I gave my heart can now With perfect love of heart atone, If you can be my very own, My love with faithful eyes and honest brow, We still may gather some immortal flowers. I gave you love beyond the love I gave Ever to any,—love beyond all speech: You stabbed me deeplier far than all: Must our love-temple wholly fall? Is there atonement, love, within our reach? Is there a passion deeper than the grave? I think there may be. Yes: I think the man Who died on Calvary, and rose they say Triumphant from the fast-closed tomb, Might help us through this deadly gloom And change our darkness into sunlit day. No human soul can help, unless Christ can. Is there a darkness star-proof evermore? A depth of hell where God's foot fails to tread? Height beyond height the heavens arise, Vast heaven on heaven of starlit skies; Depth below depth hell's ocean seethes blood-red; Is it unsounded and without a shore? Is there a depth where God's glance cannot go? Darkness from which the Father shrinks away? Then Christ upon the cross in vain Bore for our sakes unmeasured pain; Then is there no word hopeful left to say; We reap despair, whatever seed we sow. But if the love of God can pierce the gloom, Then man's love too can follow where God's goes. My love can reach you evermore And circle hell's sea with a shore And smite the savage wave-crests to repose: My love and Christ's love can outlive the tomb. My love: for Christ and God and man are one, And God can save you, burst your prison-bars Oh love, whose look dismays despair, Can robe you in raiment pure and fair,— As dark night jewels heaven's zone with the stars, As morning gems heaven's forehead with the sun. “THE ETERNAL SILENCE” Round us spreads the eternal silence.—Not the silence of the deep Lonely dark-blue open ocean, leagues from headland and from bay,— Not the silence of the mountains where the solemn summits sleep,— Not the silence of the star-land at the closing of the day,— Not the silence of the forest, when its every leaf is still, When the whole dense tropic woodland basks beneath the tropic sun, Matches death's eternal silence. Wholly settled seems God's will: When the human life is ended, then for us that life is done. Not one sweet word! Not a whisper from beyond the deadly gloom! Not a single word to cheer us, us the living, on our way! Not a single flash of torchlight to illuminate the tomb! Never sunshine, never moonshine, never one thin starry ray! Only yesterday they loved us—then their living eyes were bright— Only yesterday we held them in our living warm embrace: What has happened? What has changed them? Still the form rests in our sight; But the human love has vanished from the dead white quiet face. Only yesterday they heard us, knew the loving voice and hand, And to-day the furthest star-gleam in the blue heaven is more near. What can measure the wild distance? As beside the dead we stand, We confront a ghostly figure, not the figure once so dear. Perfect silence, endless distance—past man's measure, past man's thought! Depth no human lead can fathom—darkness utter and profound! Well God keeps his final secret. All the ages have besought; Every soul has craved an answer from the darkness. Not a sound! Is it well, O God, to take them? Is it nobly, rightly, done? Is this policy of darkness quite the grandest line of all? If a son must lose his mother, or a mother lose her son, Is it well to sweep the dead one out of earshot, out of call? Would not one slight vision help us—just a whisper, just a word, Just a green leaf sent for token, just a touch from out the gloom? Life is changed from epic grandeur—it becomes three parts absurd, One part bitter, when confronted with the sphinx-face of the tomb. Yes, absurd: for through the sorrow and the mystic awe and dread Something of grotesqueness glimmers, something farcical and strange. Why does God create his millions, just to strike those millions dead? Is he hampered, is he pestered, by the ceaseless love of change? Trouble, endless toil and trouble, to complete a human life— Pains to educate and train it—and it ends so very soon! God provides the child a mother, and he sends the man a wife; Lest the earth trip in the darkness, lo! he sends the earth a moon: All seems full of thought and labour, wrought with endless love and care; Blue and grand is the wide ocean, green and flower-sown are the meads, Full of star-lamps is the darkness, full of fragrance is the air,— All the living world bears witness to the Lord God's mighty deeds;— Yes, and mightier than the star-land hung with lamps that gem the night, Grander than the heaven of August when its utmost calm is won, Is the rapture God created when he made the darkness bright With the glory of love that needs not earthly moon or star or sun. Yet it ends in utter darkness! All this noble work of God's Ends abruptly, ends in failure. Death is Conqueror, so it seems: Sweetest flesh must turn to ashes, mightiest brains must mix with clods, Love must wake—within its coffin—from its life of pleasant dreams. Grandly God mapped out his drama, but the villain of the piece Was too forceful for the Playwright, Death has got the upper hand: When he stalks along the footlights, the light-hearted plaudits cease; Death has introduced some “business” that the Author never planned. But God's answer came, soft-whispered through the silence of the night: “Have I moulded one fair planet? Can I not mould thousands more? Have I made the morning radiant with the great sun's golden light? Can I not devise new sunshine for the dead souls to adore? Lo! I keep my solemn secret. But I keep it for your sakes. To the gentle, to the simple, I can whisper through their dream: I can whisper sweetest comfort to the heart that well-nigh breaks; When the stars of heaven are clouded, I can make my starlight gleam. “Not for genius is my message. Genius on the earth may rule,— Sway the hearts of many women, win the worship of the rose; Genius is but as a pupil (not an apt one) in my school; What he doubts, and what he questions, the unlettered peasant knows. Yes: the simple heart that trusteth never fails to hear my voice, Knows my secret often better than the genius it may be; Catches even my faintest whisper, when I bid that heart rejoice, Past the trumpets of the storm-winds, through the thunders of the sea! “Did the humble ever dread me? Did the lowly patient heart Ever tremble, as Death's angel made a silence in the room? Soul by soul, the human millions rise up softly and depart: Summer after summer sends me every field's and forest's bloom. Mothers yield to me their children, and the husband yields his wife, And the night-time yields its starlight, all the splendour it has won: Am not I, the Lord of deathland, also Lord of birth and life? Am not I, the Lord of darkness, the creator of the sun?” THREE SONNETS I. LOVE, AND DREAMS OF LOVE Through years on years a man dreamed dreams on dreams Of love.—The flowers of every spring were fair, And love-thoughts glistened through the summer air And mingled with the lilies on the streams And wove gold circlets from the starry beams:— Slow step by step Love's marble palace-stair The man climbed, and it rang with laughter rare, And sweet eyes met his own with answering gleams. At last he reached the central palace-room, And lo! a woman's form he there descried. She rose to meet him. In that fragrant gloom, Dream following dream, a whole life's love-thoughts died. Love's voice to every dream of love spake doom, And the soul found its all-sufficient Bride. II. SWEETER O love, love, never turn away thy face! If I am faithful—if the stormy sea Gives its wild strength and wilder song to thee, Hold thou, sweet river, full of light and grace, River whose tides green thymy shores embrace, Hold thou for ever firm of heart to me! If my fierce waves defy eternity, Within those waves thy soft blue waters place. I tire of images—I tire of song— Song leads to love, and love bestows at last Not fame but rest. Sweeter it is to me The soft love-light within thine eyes to see Than all old triumphs won by labour strong, All laurel-crowns or dream-crowns of my past. III. LOVE'S FINAL POWERS There are strong powers of love that early years Know little of.—All added force of being Gives love new deeper tenderer eyes for seeing, And love wins sweetness from a lifetime's tears. All pangs and hopes and joys and trembling fears Add strength to love. As life's black darkness grows Love's firmer step through that murk darkness goes And, dauntless, over the grave's brink Love peers. There are strange powers of love that youthful days Know little of. There is a love beside Whose strength the passion of the ocean wide Is like the ripples whispering in blue bays: A love beside whose strength death's fingers wild Are weak as pink soft fingers of a child. “NEVER FAREWELL TO THEE!” Never farewell. Though all life changes round about us, Never farewell to thee! The summers smile and pass. The new spring days without us Win the same ecstasy. Life deepens into death, and death brings new life bearing New gifts that time may take. Leaf saith to leaf farewell, and flower to flower despairing:— Flower-hearts and men's hearts break. Death seems to rule, and pain with foot alert and deadly Treads through the ill-fated throng. The world seems just one waste, one sorrowful vast medley Of wrath and grief and wrong. “Farewell!” “farewell!” “farewell!” saith one heart to another; The sad cry fills the air. “Farewell!” saith love to love. “Farewell!” saith son to mother. This world's gift is despair. Yet, though all things be thus, despair shall never reach us If Love's strong hand we hold. If Love be guide of ours, if Love sustain and teach us, Joy never shall grow old. Let “farewell” ring throughout the universe—I care not, If thou art true to me. My love looks in death's eyes, yet crieth “I despair not: Never farewell to thee!” March 8, 1885. THE ETERNAL LIFE This is the eternal life. All spheres are one: The sphere of our own vast monarchal sun And all the suns of space; The sphere of this world's hare-bells, and the sphere Of yonder gold-brown runnel tinkling clear Through pebbly shoals and bays. The eternal life impinges upon this. The red-lipped maid and lover, when they kiss, Join lips in heaven, not here: The murderer, poising high his bloody brand, Stabs deep his victim in another land Than this. Hell's gates are near. All things that here seem local and apart Unite their powers in one surpassing Art Which circles strong and weak When life climbs upward to a higher range. The sculptor's work becomes a living strange New form. The dead eyes speak. The poet hears the music of his strain As outward chords of music; and, again, The great composer hears The passionate torrent of unspoken speech Which, latent in his notes, he could not reach Nor utter to our ears. The painter sees the hills and dales he sought Not now mere subjects of pictorial thought, Mere panoramic things; He marks the actual height of azure air Which on his canvas was exceeding fair,— Each actual oak-branch swings. The silver rivulets he painted leap Now down an actual craggy pine-clothed steep; The blue waves that he limned Dance underneath true sunlight, and the sky, Real, hears real larches and real aspens sigh; The stars flash out undimmed. He painted Cleopatra? Lo! she stands— With laughing eyes and with beseeching hands She lures him to her side. Among the women of his artist's dream He now may choose that one whose glances gleam Most tenderly, for bride. Sphere touches sphere. They mingle and collide. Hell's arches gloom and threaten by the side Of heaven's doors all aglow. The man who sits beside us, it may be, Is fire-tossed on the intolerable sea Of hell, could we but know. A darkness not of night, unlit by stars, Void of the moon—a gloom which no sound jars (Harsh sounds were welcome there!) Wraps all the lonely weary wastes of earth For some, doomed spirits from their very birth, The bond-slaves of despair. For others the whole earth is glad and sweet. With the spring's buoyant pulse their pulses beat; Their endless life is won: This world to them is heaven, for they create In this dark world of wretchedness and hate Light fairer than the sun. And so with God. Behind the lying sphere Of the unjust grim god who rules us here Another Godhead dwells: A God whose eyes can pierce beyond the feasts Of Churches,—past the idols of the priests, Past all their heavens and hells. To him the poets, one by one, appeal. When shines the sunlight of his face, they feel That hell's flame dies away: That darkling lands whereover chaos reigned, Where captives in murk dungeons pined and plained, Are crimsoned with the day. To him, past God and God, the poets reach. Him they believe in; him their hearts beseech; His eyes and his alone They seek. Their spirits search behind the stars, Making away with every mist that bars The sky-way to his throne. All souls who come between they hurl aside, Whether they be by centuries deified Or for one instant strong. The same swift inspiration through them flows Whence Jewish prophets' fiery speech arose And David's eager song. Behind the souls that hate, the Gods that slay, Ephemeral dying Gods of yesterday Whose thrones one moment gleam, The changeless just Eternal One abides: And past him all the ages' movement glides Like an unending dream. THE ACTIVE DEAD The dead work for our good with love beyond The love they here attained: Their spirits bid our spirits not despond; They bid us climb the hill-tops they have gained. They, could they speak to us, would evermore Forbid our souls to weep: They would command our hearts and thoughts to soar; They would awaken us from hopeless sleep. They, who have ever helped, know better now What high gifts to bestow: They breathe repose upon the weary brow; At night their solemn whispers come and go. And they are with us in the summer days; They speak in our still hours: Though wondrous scenes are bursting on their gaze They never can forget earth's simple flowers. Our hyacinths still bloom within their hearts; Our snowdrops still are white: And still our various-blossomed June imparts Joy to their day and fragrance to their night. They rest. But this their rest—to love us more, To guard us till we meet: The hearts whose loss our faithless souls deplore Were never quite so close, nor half so sweet. THE CROWN OF DEATH Strange is it how the hand of Death bestows Upon the humblest head A crown more sweet than garlands woven of rose, How kingly are the dead! To-day this girl laughs out from coral lips: Within, the smooth teeth shine. She climbs the hills, or watches the white ships Upon the horizon-line. How full of lovely life she is to-day! How her clear laughter rings! To-morrow she is dead and passed away: No more the young voice sings. And then how deep the awe that holds us bound! The merry girl we knew Has passed beyond earth's silvery rillets' sound, Beyond sunshine and dew. She knows to-day what we not yet may know, Sees what we cannot see, Hears songs we cannot hear. She puts on now Her immortality. The simplest child, when crowned by death's great hand, Becomes a queen or king; A citizen of the untraversed land; A dream-girt ghostlike thing. The golden hair that once we knew so well, Bright-shining in our sun, Shines now in sunlight strange that never fell On heights man's foot has won. The eyes we loved,—that looked along with us On green-robed hedge and plain, Will never more regard the prospect thus, Will gaze not thus again. They gaze at flowers and hills we cannot see; At stars we cannot guess: But yesterday they smiled at you or me; The red lips laughed their “Yes!” To-day they will not answer. No, the child Has outgrown our demesne. We are the children. She was falsely styled A child,—she is a queen. THE REAL AND THE IDEAL Some live through many lives. Some pass at once Beyond the region of our stars and suns Into a higher air. Back some return, and ever back again— Renew their pleasures, and renew their pain; Their foreheads once again are grooved with care. With lust some souls for countless ages burn: Some after earth's high prizes pant and yearn And toil for years untold, Some seek for raptures won at point of sword And for wild battle's turbulent reward For ages. Some for centuries worship gold. The beauty of form that womanhood reveals, A robe which half displays and half conceals The spirit's deeper charm— The glory of this may keep a soul spell-bound For centuries that lapse past without a sound. His heaven is in sweet curve of breast or arm. The joy of holding manhood's heart enchained— For this joy many a woman has remained On earth for centuries long. A robin here and there repeats one note Till, wildly in love with his own throbbing throat, He greets eternal mornings with his song. There are, I doubt not, souls on earth to-day Who watched the waves in many a Grecian bay Break, with their ripples blue. Some hearts have loved a woman's form so well That only to possess her soul were hell:— These tarry on earth for a myriad ages too. Helen is here mayhap, and Paris' face Troubled to madness by her changeless grace. Napoleon haunts the field Of ominous Waterloo. He is not dead: He still confronts the line of moveless red, And cannot die because he will not yield. Hosts of uneasy spirits cannot pass. All souls who fail in the earth-sphere to amass Sufficient spirit-power, Too weak to enter on the life beyond, Still travail here, and sorrow, and despond: For ever in the bud, they cannot flower. Lovers have found their ladies' lips so sweet That they have prayed for nothing save to meet Those lips eternally. God grants their prayer; for back to life they come And haunt unalterably their earthly home And watch the same sun light the same grey sea. But those who pass and never need to turn Back to this earth-sphere, live and love and yearn And labour in higher ways. Theirs is reality. Ours is the dream. They live and love indeed. We only seem To live and love. We twine pale phantom-bays. The soul's eternal never-cloying kiss, This has the true possession in it,—this Is sweeter than the dream, The phantom of a kiss that has detained Millions of lingering hearts its ghost-touch gained While earth-suns glimmered on green wood or blue stream. CHARLES GEORGE GORDON: Killed at Khartoum, Jan. 26, 1885 SONNET In these wild later days when faith seems dead And the old Hebrew creed a worn-out thing; When hope in heaven's eternal righteous King Seems fading from the earth, despair instead Filling the hearts of Youth and Age with dread And crowning Winter and dethroning Spring; When no man knows what the next morn may bring While watching sunset flaunt its soulless red; When grim doubt triumphs, and all hearts wax cold And weary, yet again was faith new-born In one man's heart on whom the world's first morn Still gleamed, with God within the morning's gold: God, disregarding this deaf century's scorn, Spake face to face with one man as of old. THE DIRECT AND THE INDIRECT TOUCH In closest contact with the Jewish race, Hand as it were in hand, and face to face, God stood. Each mortal action thrilled to the very heart Of the Immortal. Man was actual part Of God. Man—God: one double solitude. Man acted then as limb, or tongue, or hand Of God,—as under his direct command, As swayed By his immediate voice, or his swift eye. God's trumpet-message shook the stormless sky And man, with terror at his heart, obeyed. God spoke to Greece through loveliness of form: Not through the rolling Sinaitic storm, Or thunderless blue air. Nay! through a girl's unfathomable grace; Or through the kinghood in a Hector's face; Or through the golden light in Venus' hair. By gifts he spake—not now by the direct Strong former touch, as to his old elect In fiery Palestine. God here withdrew the fierce light of his face That men might better apprehend the grace Of Beauty, curve by curve and line by line. To-day he speaks to us—sometimes by Art; Sometimes directly—to the broken heart, Or will. Sometimes by messages the sunset brings, Or the first star whose golden sandal springs Alert above yon purple-shouldered hill. Perhaps for many a day and many a night He leaves the moon and soft stars to give light; The world seems empty of him; Then on a sudden, sundering the skies, He, the Jehovah, on the spirit's eyes Flashes, till every star in heaven turns dim. A POET'S THOUGHTS The thoughts that haunt the poet like a dream, Strange sweet ghost-shapes that through his fancy gleam, Will one day haunt all hearts as well. He fills the wide world with his love of flowers, And with his love of summer sunlit hours, And with his hate of hell. The woman whom he loves and crowns shall stand One day imperial over every land. The passionate eyes that haunt his sleep Shall one day flash upon the world, and make (Not now the poet's, nay) the world's heart ache, And make the world's eyes weep. Whom he has crowned, is crowned. Whom he has raised Shall in the end by all men's tongues be praised. The carven brow he moulds for us Before the world is ever statuesque. The king or charlatan he makes grotesque Shall be grotesque for ever,—alway thus. While creeds and sub-creeds pass, his dreams endure. All that he dreamed of tender things and pure, All that he touched to beauty and bloom, All that he loved with godlike love, shall last When every star we see to-day has past, Orb following orb, into eternal gloom. LOVE'S ARGUMENT He.— “How lovely is that curve of dazzling breast! Now am I blest Beyond all words, in that thou art so fair!”She.— “Thou art the stronger. Teach me, love, to be Ever to thee True helper. In life's struggle let me share!” He.— “The starlit heaven is less sweet than thine eyes: Within them lies An unknown passionate world beyond my dream.”She.— “Yet must we, prisoners in this world of woe, Climb from below Long leagues before heaven's mountain-summits gleam.” He.— “Bend forward gently. Shaped e'en Phidias' hand A neck more grand In every passionate sweet imperious line?”She.— “Time will not spare, who spares no loveliest flower; It has its hour: Seek thou the soul's imperishable shrine.” He.— “Hath the soul radiant beauty such as this? Such lips to kiss, Such hair to fondle, and such hands to stroke?”She.— “To-morrow some new woman will pass by: Through mouth and eye 'Twill be to thee as if a new God spoke.” He.— “Love me to-day. Lo! all the heaven is bright With sweet sunlight, And yet thy loveliness outshines the sun.”She.— “If I love thee, wilt thou love me till death? Will his cold breath Leave the two souls inseparably one?” PAST AND FUTURE Vales where the silken rose In rathe abundance grows, These, as the long years close, Our souls sigh after. Not yet our tired heart thrills At sight of blue bright rills That rift the heavenly hills With silver laughter. Still the old vales attract, And still their charms exact From word and thought and act Love and devotion. Not yet through magic sleep We pass to a new steep And from it mark a deep Undreamed-of ocean. Our thoughts still backward turn Towards far-off brook and burn, Forget-me-not and fern, And heath and daisy. We are half in love with life, Half long for death to wife, So pass our days in strife And wanderings mazy. Death hath not wholly won. Still charm is in the sun; The gleaming ripples run, The blue wave dances: We dream of boyish days And smiling woodland ways,— And now the soul delays, And now advances. A bird's nest in the wood; A mountain solitude; A hill where rain-clouds brood; A river region Where the clear current sips The green bank's mossy lips; Hedges of haws and hips, A scarlet legion; A reeded river marge Whereby the painted barge Slides, seeking the far large Waste sea's redundance; Gardens where blossoms spread, Geraniums pink and red, Pansies with purple head, In sweet abundance; These things lure back again Our thought, our love, our pain. We hear the old love-strain Which that brown throstle Sang through the sunset-air In the great beech-tree there, Pure, silver-throated, fair Spring's first apostle. And yet a nobler song May greet our ears ere long, Full of glad voices, strong Unknown new-comers, When past our death we climb Beyond the reach of time, Past snows and ice and rime, Past springs and summers. The future is our own: Youth's flower-bright fields are mown; The past is overthrown By God's enacting. No past, however sweet, Can be the soul's retreat: To ponder is defeat; Rise, and be acting! WOMAN AND NATURE A glory of light beyond his utmost dream Had flashed with sunlike flame and moonlike gleam On Wordsworth's eyes Had he discerned the sovereign force that fills With lovelier light than theirs the laughing hills And answering skies. The secrets of the grass and of the dew, And of the lakes, the lonely poet knew: These spake aloud. He heard the voices of the stars at night As they climbed upward from slow height to height, From cloud to cloud. And yet he missed the magic of each place, Because he missed the magic of the face Of her whose power Sways Nature,—fills the golden fields with bloom And bids a million rosebuds burst their tomb In one bright hour. Who yields his spirit to the sterile hills Wins his reward. His lonely strong heart thrills At storm and sun; At bastioned thunder-cloud, and mountain rain, And light renewed when the green slopes again Gleam one by one. He hath his high reward,—and yet the higher Reward and sweeter is to feel the fire Of love suffuse The crags and glens and mountain-threatened vales; To know the sovereign of the streams and dales, Their queen-recluse. The surmise of the love within the rose, The sense as of a Spirit whose passion glows In flower and tree, Links a diviner magic than he knew To those same valleys Wordsworth wandered through Yet could not see. SONNET TO ENGLAND Dark days are coming, England. Lo! the sky Is foul and rank with treason, and there are Who say they see the setting of thy star And hold that thou wilt pass away and die. With storm and strife, with keen device and lie Thy foes assail thee. Thou hast journeyed far Since on the Belgian plain thine hosts did bar The hosts of France, and mocked the eagle's cry. But thou art still the same. Thine eyes of fire Have still the strange strong look of Waterloo: If now thy foes are many, and full of ire, Eager thy toil of centuries to undo, Yet still thou hast the power, if thou desire, To thine own deathless record to be true. Feb. 8, 1885. “THE SOVEREIGN ROSE” “God, having made the countless flowers of earth That laugh amid our woods with choral mirth Of clustering sister-stems And having thronged the realms of azure space With star on star, and crowned each star with grace Of blossom-diadems,— “God, having made the flowers, had still one more To mould and shape—no model in his store Suited his work's grand close; So he created woman's lips for this, And with the royal fragrance of her kiss Imbued the sovereign rose. “Therefore all love is good. Who wins a flower Wins a new fragment of God's life that hour And wins one glance supreme Into the deep abysses of God's heart, Limitless depths beyond the strength of Art To fathom in a dream.” So speaks the poet in his early days. Each sweet first tender impulse moves and sways His heart, so swiftly won! He dreams beneath the moon, and thinks the night Sufficient. When a million stars are bright The eye forgets the sun. Yet surely comes the hour when through his dream The morning breaks. Sweet was the moony gleam That lit the soft night-breeze; Sweet was it just to cull love's lighter flowers In life's first lighter less impassioned hours And rest content with these. At last the poet apprehends the soul Of woman,—knows that he, to win the whole, Must give the whole as well: That what he gives, he wins; that woman grows (Just as man wills) to earth's divinest rose Or fieriest flower of hell. Who giveth much, receiveth much. Not he Who sings of her soft tresses tenderly And loves her for an hour, Not he shall win her worship absolute: Seldom that man shall grasp the final fruit Who dallies with the flower. Woman can equal man in loving strength: She shall surpass him, when her heart at length Quite flowers with fragrance fair. The man who brings her all the soul of Art Never quite wins her secret silent heart Unless his soul is there. 'Tis soul and soul. The perfect souls must meet In union never-ending, ever-sweet,— In love's sublime repose. He who would sway the gentlest girlish heart Must give his own, and give it not in part; He wins what he bestows. PURITY OF HEART What lured and won the poet's heart? Who knows?— The passion of the throat, the lips' repose— The night's sweet darkness gathered in her hair? Or was it rather the deep Spanish eyes? The glance of light that to love's glance replies? The girlish gentleness of mien and air? I think the poet's soul was won by this; Not by the sweetness of her rich soft kiss, Not by this only—though by this in part: I think the poet's soul was won indeed And won for evermore, though won with speed, By sovereign truth and purity of heart. May 30, 1886. “THE MIGHTY MANY-SOUNDING ENGLISH SEA” The mighty many-sounding English sea Forgets to love its moon and worships thee; The English meadows, by thy beauty won, Dream in thy glances and forget the sun; The English dales, and dells of deep-green gloom, Beneath thy footing tremble into bloom; The morning follows thee; the wondering night Forgets its stars—for are not thine eyes bright? The English summer wind must tune its lute, Love, at thy voice,—or be for ever mute; The laughter in the branches of the pine Was never lovely till it copied thine; An English poet loves thee,—and his heart For ever singing sings how small a part, How frail a fragment, of thy beauty's soul; Can mortal foot attain love's timeless goal? Can mortal strength avail to worship thee Who hast the sweetness of Eternity? DEATH AND LOVE We rule the blue-green waves that round our shores For ever surge. In vain the tempest roars; The sea yields, and the land: But death and love evade our conquering will. We strive to master them. They cheat us still With unique sleight of hand. The humblest cottage-home, whose garden gleams With scented English blossoms, has its dreams Of love and death, alas! Beside our hamlets ever stands the church, And white tombs near it—under elm or birch, Nestling in dark-green grass. The kingliest race is subject unto death. The lordliest heart oft shudders at the wreath That it perforce must wear One day,—the wreath of agony, when those For whom life's sun, long ere our sunrise, rose Pass, and our souls despair. No stroke of mortal sword, or shock of spear, Can force our English-bred tough hearts to fear; But one thing even we Dread,—that shrill trumpet of malignant doom Which summons our belovéd to the tomb With fiendish constancy. To see them pass, and helplessly to stand By their bed-sides while with white trembling hand They grasp death's hand and go, This pierces to the heart. No mastering force Can hold the blood from faltering in its course, From freezing in its flow, When at the touch of death lo! love is gone, And we are left unalterably alone. Death drives us to despair, And when despair lifts up wild anguished eyes To the grim heights of waste unlighted skies, Behold, a God is there! Christ conquers race on race, and heart on heart, Because he speaks a message not of Art And not of flowers and trees, And not the message of the lover's rose, And not the word of woman's mouth that glows Red-ripe, nor of the seas,— No, not the thunder's or the lightning's word, Nor voice as of the solemn mountains stirred By storms that never cease; When earth has not one accent left of cheer At last Christ's one word wins the human ear, And that one word is “Peace.” BURIED FLOWERS To-day the poor man's fire ablaze That saves him from the cold Takes back the thought to other days, To tropic woodlands old. These coals that give the poor man heat Once filled the air with odours sweet. They waved as grass, they smiled as flowers, They climbed the trunks of trees; They filled old long-forgotten hours With odorous ecstasies. These English coals which now we burn, Black now, were once gay flower or fern. They fill to-day the poor man's grate And warm the wintry air. Black lumps they seem! How strange their fate: Once they were passing fair. They smiled in heaven's old morning-mirth And then were buried deep in earth. It matters not! To-day they rise, And nobler work they do Than when, 'neath ever-burning skies Of ceaseless sunlit blue, They filled the flowery vales with scent, Till their first languid life was spent. In this grey Northern land they burn, Black shiny precious things. They lend the heat by which the urn To the bright tea-pot sings. They lend us heat of heart to jog Through ceaseless rain and endless fog. Their lives are measured not by ours. We live and die; but they Count by a million years their hours: We are of yesterday: The coals we pigmies pile and light Were born in pre-Noachian night. The chestnut-seller in the street Keeps his hot chestnuts warm With buried flowers that once were sweet, That fronted sun and storm In lands and years when things we see Were still remote futurity. The humming-bird has glittered down On yonder mass of coal When it was pliant creeper-crown To some tree's mossy bole. Nature's strange all-embracing plan Stores up the priceless past for man. Within earth's granary deep and thick These silent stores were heaped Till at the miner's sturdy pick From the black depths they leaped. Dead flowers must face our smoke and mist Whose petals once the sun's mouth kissed. And then they cheer us—you and me— With steady warmth and light. They aid our English fireside glee; They make the ingle bright; And then in flames once more expire And, born in sunlight, pass in fire. “WILL YOU GET ME SOME FAIRY-TALES?” Three years ago you asked for fairy-lore; Three years ago, three wild strange years or more, With girlish laughter You revelled in the fairy-tales I brought. We only dreamed of love. We guessed not aught Of all life's pain and strife that followed after. To-day, again, you say “Bring fairy-tales.” Yes, you are right. Whatever woe assails Wall, beam and rafter, Of the frail house of life, it still is well As far as may be in the realm to dwell Of love and fairy-dreams and young light laughter. “ Life should be one long fairy-tale for you” I said—“one summer dream of skies of blue, Were I deviser Of life's events.” Three years have passed away. Your poet's hair is some degrees more grey: Your black hair crowns a forehead three years wiser! But I will work your bidding. We will go Once more where magic silver waters flow; Once more surprise her, The Fairy Queen, and mark her deep eyes change With sudden transformation sweet and strange Into your eyes, my miracle-deviser! DRAMATIC DIALOGUES I. She.— “Why do you love me?” He.— “For your coal-black hair That brings before my eyes the passionate South: Because, although my lips in song despair, Hope thrills them at the touching of your mouth. Because, when life was weary and at an end, Like the bright soul of very Spring you came, Sister and love, a sweetheart in a friend, And fanned with girlish breath joy's flickering flame And so I love you.” She.— “Will your love abide Stedfast and faithful, since we cannot be Sweetheart and lover, husband and fair bride, But have to move apart eternally?” He.— “Lady! the night when first you came to meet A weary poet, placing trust in him, Will fill my soul with memories starry-sweet Till on night's purple robe each star grows dim.” She.— “But think, how long is life, how dull and cold! Can such a love as this content you well? To love, but never to possess and hold, Men teach that this, to man, is worse then hell.” He.— “Worse than a hell it is! Yet you are fair: God made me love you, and such love is gain. If love at times seems shadowed by despair, Still will I love,—if not in joy, in pain. Perhaps, if early in life our eyes had met, The strength for perfect love had not been ours: But now upon the hills our feet are set, And we can gather noble mountain-flowers.” She.— “But if you die, and if I marry then?” He.— “Sweetheart, if God who made me love you so Can take your lips, your heart, from me again, There is no medicine for that mastering woe.” She.— “Stay—” He.— “Never! Did not God himself declare As down the starry heights his great voice rang That you were destined for the one thing fair For me? So I took up my harp and sang. Did God not let me kiss the coal-black hair? Yes, God and you—allowing bliss and pang?” She.— “But ought you thus to have acted? Was it wise, Knowing the barriers Fate has placed between?” He.— “Lady, I met the splendour of your eyes, And barriers vanished at that glance, I ween!” She.— “What is the gain? Ephemeral surely and small, When weighed with what man's heart counts gain and bliss?” He.— “Not half your soul I ask. I ask for all. I ask for years of marriage in one kiss. To feel your soul grow to me day by day With lovely trust and confidence serene: To know that doubts and fears have fled away: To feel your girlish heart completely lean On mine: this is the high reward I pray Your sovereign grace to gift me with, my queen!” She.— “And is that marriage?” He.— “That is the deep soul Of marriage, not the phantom and the form: The marriage-love that, though wild thunders roll, Can breast the cloud-waves and defy the storm. Yes, this is marriage.” She.— “Is not marriage, then, The orange-blossomed daily thing we see?” He.— “Will lace and orange-blossoms help you when, Loveless, you have to face eternity? Will silk and silver and gold and praise of men Assist, when you at last—look round for me?” She.— “Nay, not so fast!” He.— “Nay, faster—for I know, As man knows deep by intuition's law, I, having worshipped, having loved you so, With such sweet homage and such rapturous awe, That every other love, though it sound fair And whatsoever gifts its right hand bring, Would in its left hand bring you black despair And sorrow past our mortal reckoning. No woman ever is loved as I love you Twice on the earth, twice in eternity: You'd miss my old grey eyes, and find the new Brown eyes a trifle tedious, it may be!” She.— “Brown eyes are pretty.” He.— “Yes, your brown eyes have The Pyrenean magic in their gaze: Most stately, queenly, thoughtful, noble, grave, They make me dream of Southern hills and bays.” She.— “But I,—I was not talking of my own”— He.— “And I—I never talk except of yours”— She.— “To argue with a poet”— He.— “Ah, your tone So silver-sweet, ineffably allures!” She.— “But, just to say the same old thing once more, We are debarred and shut off, each from each.” He.— “Can wave thrill wave along the shadowy shore, Can moonbeams mix above the glimmering beach, Can star reach star across the tremulous night, Can sun touch sun across wan leagues of air, And cannot we blend sorrow and delight And peace unchangeably, my one thing fair?” She.— “A poet's thought and diction!” He.— “Nay, the truth To-day as ever is in a poet's dream: True visions, as of everlasting youth And endless summer, through your glances gleam.” She.— “And if I trust you utterly?” He.— “Your trust Will not be misplaced. Set your lips on mine. When heaven's stars vanish, worn to golden dust, Unwrecked, undaunted, shall our love-star shine.” II. He.— “Marriage is friendship,—but it adds a higher And nobler sweetness to the friendly phase; Touches emotion with diviner fire, And wreathes pale crowns with crimson blossom-sprays. Something supremely sweet and pure it brings, Yet all the sacred gifts that friendship brought Are still included.” She.— “Necklaces and rings And bracelets seem to me the gifts most sought By average brides; and by the average man”— He.— “Yes, that is just the sorrow and curse— The misery, the grief, the bitter ban, Too sea-deep to be sounded in a verse. Most bitter indeed it is that love should be Degraded (as it is) far, far, below The level of friendship even.” She.— “Yes, I see Daily how marriage ends in strife and woe. That makes a woman cautious.” He.— “Well may she Be cautious, for she, giving, gives her all. She gives the wonder of her purity. Her gift is infinite: man's gift is small. And yet not always. When a man bestows His noblest purest manhood, then the gift Has its own godlike fragrance, though the rose Of womanhood be sweeter.” She.— “Thus to sift, Divide and analyse, dissect and part Love (poor old sweet love!) makes one half despair.” He.— “Yes, but the lesson is—Find one true heart; Hold it God's choicest gift, his dower most rare. And for much-blundering man the lesson is— Raise woman; help her; learn, if she be pure, She wholly gives her being in her kiss: She loves with love most sacred and most sure.” She.— “How did you learn this? True it is indeed, But as a rule men hear it with surprise.” He.— “I learnt it where I learnt my whole love-creed, Through watching the pure woman in your eyes. One woman can reveal all purity, All love, all womanhood, deep things past speech, To her one lover, so that lover be Willing to let her, quite unconscious, teach.” She.— “Unconscious—yes!” He.— “That is the very chief Of all things. As our love and friendship grew From spring to summer, from slow bud to leaf, From autumn skies to heights of summer blue, I watched you daily and within your eyes I read deep lessons, as I marked the change From fair bright girl to woman fair and wise, As your thoughts ripened, took a wider range. But if you had not been unconscious—quite— All had been spoilt. So tender is the flower Of womanhood the least fleck mars the white, Sullies its petals, and discounts its power. In fact the insane whole effort of the world Is to destroy the thing it values most; To force from blossom-folds not half unfurled A fragrance which, if scattered, soon is lost. If only all women were as pure as you”— She.— “Or all men sound of heart, my true old friend”— He.— “Love would be fresh and sweet as morning dew, And half the sorrows of the world would end.” III. She.— “Have you no faith in God?” He.— “At times I have: At other times my very soul despairs. The world seems one enormous loveless grave,— Dark, but for fiery blasts of hell's hot airs. Yes, my queen-sweetheart, were it not for you, I think I'd hardly care to struggle on: Still on me beamed a glimpse of sunlit blue And God's eyes seemed to smile, when your eyes shone. I know it. Yet a horror grips me hard, A horror lest the Lord, in bringing you Into my life thus, played his last trump card And now has nothing further good to do. Such eyes as yours he wisely kept in store: He could not twice produce a thing so sweet. Now, having played you, what can he do more, Save acquiesce in sorrow and defeat?” She.— “Another inference is just and wise, Juster and wiser: that the God who put Beauty and hope (you say) within my eyes Can bring life's bud to flower, life's flower to fruit.” He.— “And yet he seems to me a Janus-god Often,—two-faced, deceiving, wanton, hard. Why did he open out so sweet a road, And then leave every gate at the ending barred? In one word, why did God so fill my heart With overflowing love and sweet desire, Desire of you, if at the end we part? Can God make holiest hope, profoundest liar?” She.— “We have not parted yet.” He.— “The very thought Is like a storm-wind whirling all the stars Across black space. God made this world for nought, The golden sun, soft Venus, fiery Mars, The universe in fine, when thus he brought My strong love face to face with mocking bars!” She.— “Perhaps, where love is, iron bars only seem: One day yourself may own that God is true, True past your wildest most poetic dream.” He.— “On one condition—that he gives me you.” BORN UPON NEW YEAR'S DAY Born with the glad New Year, Thou bringest blessing, dear,— Thou also makest all things bright and new: Thoughts of spring's sunnier skies Gleam soft within thine eyes, And dreams of summer's dome of statelier blue. Thy birthday is a sign Made evermore divine To me, as unto man the New Year's birth: A sign that God is good; That bare-branched dreary wood And grove will laugh once more with leafy mirth. A sign that once again Summer will banish pain; Thou art my ever-present New Year's day— Thou art my sign from heaven, My sweet one bright star given To light a weary heart along the way. Be ever unto me A New Year. As to thee Thy birthday brought the New Year's light and shine, Bring me an ever-true Delight, an ever-new Summer of hope in God and love divine. A QUEEN'S MANDATE Back to the smoke-fed city from the sea Thou, stronger than the sea's hand, drawest me: Back, past green hill-side, flower and field and tree, To where the eternal fog-bound turrets rise. For thy sake dearer than the mountain-air And than the breezy cliff-tops even more fair Are the dim robes of mist the houses wear Beneath their sunless moonless starless skies. Thou biddest me return, and lo! I leave The golden-coloured morn, the crimson eve; Thy queenly laughing mandate I receive, And bend before the sovereign in thine eyes. I leave my labour here,—I put it by; I bid farewell to the wide dome of sky And to the sea-bird's silver wings that fly Across the watery waste that throbs and sighs. Thou art my ocean, love, my star and sun; Without thee heaven is lost, heaven hardly won; As if love never yet had even begun I seek thee, longing to be made more wise In holiest love-lore, love, than ever yet; Feeling as though our eyes had never met; Feeling as though thy lips had not been set On mine,—as if sweet love were still surprise. For that is what I ever feel of thee: Thou art as new-born as the new-born sea Each morning, or the new pink almond-tree That with the pinkness of the morning vies. Thou art as new-born as the gracious gold That clings around the sun's form, fold on fold, Each break of day. Thou never canst grow old; Thou art the truth, and death is he who lies. Thy strong attraction over leagues of space Lures me and draws me to thy dwelling-place; I long to watch the beauty of thy face, The magic in thy glance that never dies. As the strong sun attracts the furthest star, Piercing past wall of storm and cloudy bar, So where thy most magnetic glances are I have to be. I am thy spoil and prize. If I were further than the furthest light Whose rippling wave-beats strike upon our sight Still wouldst thou draw me, O my one delight; Thy magic spell I still should recognise! So farewell, hill and sky and stars and sea! My love, my own true loved one, summoneth me. Where thou art, all God's stars must surely be, For in thy glances star to star replies. THE ARTIST-SOUL The clear wave's tender green, the purple skies, Take all their colour as the soul's deep eyes Regard them day by day. Nought, save as we regard it, has one shade Of colour. Our thought gilds the autumn glade And tints the rainbow spray. Is any soul in love? The groves assume That heart's high radiance, and they steep their bloom In that heart's tender light. If our hearts quite were sinless, we should know How streamed each fiery sunset's golden glow O'er Eden's every height. If our hearts quite were pure, and quite were fair, What wondrous raiment would the spring-meads wear, Outdoing all their past! With what gold crownals would the kingcups reign! The orange lily at our doors would gain Its marriage-robes at last. If our souls saw with conquering sinless eyes The heights and depths, the sacred sunlit skies, The moon's orb silver-fringed, All things would be transfigured. Eden waits To ope to mortal its immortal gates: On our will all is hinged. Who conquers self, shall for the first time see The marvel of a snowdrop's purity, Inhale the violet's breath. Who conquers self, shall wholly understand The solemn meaning of the sea and land, The laws of life and death. Who conquers self, shall understand the whole And with the cleanséd eyesight of the soul Observe all things anew. The new-born emerald mountain-slopes shall gleam With all the light and richness of a dream, Sparkling with morning dew. The soul shall rise triumphant, and shall say, “The wonder of this rhododendron spray Is wholly new to me. In all old days the tossing tides I saw Were dark and turbulent. With love and awe I watch my first blue sea.” THE HEAVENLY ARMIES The heavenly hosts are ever marching Upon their eager way To reach the abodes of mortal anguish: They march both night and day. Along the heavenly plains their banners And plumes and keen swords shine: The heavenly hosts are ever passing Across earth's frontier-line. Never was human soul beleaguered But in some barrack-square Far, it may be, in utmost heaven Rang out the bugles' blare. Never was human soul encompassed By dark foes crowding round Without the tramp of heavenly legions, Without their trumpets' sound. For ah! their strong celestial Leader Sends not his aid too late. He finds not us, as we found Gordon, Dead at the city's gate. Too late our “thin red line” advancing Filed through the desert grim; We saved a fragment of our honour, But ah! we saved not him. Remember this—the hosts have started. They march by day and night: At dawn perhaps, or in the gloaming, They'll flash upon thy sight. Far-off upon the highway dusty Their plumes and helms will gleam! And all thy night, or day, of battle Shall end, as ends a dream. WALT WHITMAN Thy country waits its bard. This thou hast seen.— Thy soul hath revelled in the forests green; The solemn purple plains; The immense far range of hills whose summits hoar Mix with the eternal blue; the ceaseless roar Of rivers swollen by Titanic rains: Somewhat thy soul hath gathered of the might Of thine America; by day, by night, Watching, thy gaze hath won A measured glimpse of what man's eyes shall see; While Europe's slaves to kings have bent the knee Thou, yokeless, hast been vassal of the sun: Thou, scaling thought's untrodden mountain-sides, Hast felt the heart of Freedom like a bride's Against thine own heart beat; While the old world struggled, cramped by prison-bars, Thou, seeking Freedom's palace lit by stars, Didst pass the heights where storms and the eagles meet: And yet thy giant-futured marvellous land Still needs a seer whose soul shall understand, And, understanding, sing. When the true poet comes, then he will reign O'er vast America from plain to plain, And be the land's first royal-sceptred king. Nature's wild heart is fevered till it speaks. The deathless music of the mountain-peaks And waves is yet to be! America, though Whitman gave you much, He gave you not the missing royal touch: He spake not like your plains, nor like your sea. THE LONDON STREETS Of old the streets were sad and grim: They stretched along, one mass of grey, Vast leagues on leagues of saddening hue That changed not if the heaven were blue Or if the wintry sky were dim, The same from day to day. But now the London streets are bright: In this one point our victory's won; Pure country flowers adorn our streets And fill our balconies with sweets, And make our homes a blaze of light, And tell us of the sun. Geraniums red as flame are there, And golden-centred daisies white: London makes Sussex ferns its own, And calls on Devon for a loan; Pink fuchsias smile in London air, And calceolarias bright. But one thing yet remains to do— To look beyond our balconies. The girl-flowers who in thousands fade Within our city's noisome shade, Let them be loved and cherished too, Not cared for less than these! Not cared for less than flowers that cry With somewhat in their speech of scorn, “Shame that the town that worships flowers Should let far lovelier lives than ours Perish! What it one rose should die? Another rose is born. “But if ye lose one girl-flower fair In these dark streets by thousands trod, That means the loss to your grim town For ever of one lily-crown,— That means to angel-hearts despair, And agony to God.” GAZING BACKWARD We shall survey our lives, when life is past, With strange transfigured vision,—when at last The whole before us gleams. We shall say, “Here a victory was ours: Here gathered we sweet wealth of passion's flowers: Here love's eyes filled our dreams.” Yes, all shall then be changed, and yet the same. The fiery current of the sun's red flame Shall still dart down the air: The flowers shall lavish fragrance on the breeze, And still Spring's kiss shall greet the lilac-trees In London street and square. Yet, as we look, how changed ourselves shall be! With how far different glances shall we see The house-tops veiled in smoke: With what far other eyes shall we behold The sunset struggle with its soot-grimed gold Through city plane and oak. Here loved we; here we suffered; here we won A noble victory; were here undone, Were here restored and saved:— Such thoughts upon the souls with which we rise Through sullied smoke-spheres to the spotless skies Shall be past change engraved. THE WOMANHOOD OF THE FUTURE When woman understands her own pure soul; When she no longer takes Man's thought of her to guide her to the goal; When she awakes; When she once knows herself, the one pure thing Upon an earth impure, Then she will change man's nature, and will bring Peace sweet and sure. When she once knows herself—when she will be True to her own pure heart, Then she will clothe with radiant purity All life and Art. The world will be transformed. It waits for this, And it has waited long: It waits for woman's perfect marriage-kiss And nuptial song. It waits till she arises in her strength To bid all evil flee, Saying, “Who would learn God's deepest truths at length, Must learn of me. “For at the ending of the ages I, Man's sister and man's queen, Stand forth to bid all forms of evil fly From our demesne. “I come to make man pure as I am pure; To bring delights unguessed; Joy that shall vanish not, but shall endure; Raptue and rest. “For man, unless his heart be pure and true, Must ever fail to see The heart of that pure God who speaks his new Gospel through me. “Aye, to the pure in heart God's world is fair! These see with perfect sight How glorious is the summer sunlit air, The rose how white! “These only can perceive the God who dwells In woman, and take part In that great movement which our age foretells With brain and heart. “Who seeth woman, shall see God. Who fails To see and understand, Shall fail to find God—though he spread wide sails From land to land.” “HAVE FAITH IN TRUTH” Have faith in truth. The generations pass: The centuries wither like sun-stricken grass: The very stars are doomed: Yet never one true word shall pass away. The songs of David thrill our hearts to-day; His soul is disentombed. His words move English hearts.—The words of Paul Electrify and aid and lift us all In our far Northern land. No true word ever passes,—no Ideal. Is any word of Christ to-day less real Or parable less grand? Words spoken by blue calm Gennesaret Are heard to-day where ceaseless wild waves fret Wild echoing granite shores. Though all things tremble at the touch of time There is a power more solemn, more sublime, Which past the time-realm soars: There is a power at which the stars of space Tremble,—a power which finds God's dwelling-place, Quitting earth's lowlier clime: The power of each strong human soul to say, “My life's true work shall never pass away; It laughs at death and time.” THE INSPIRING SPIRITS The spirits of stars, the spirits of waves and seas, The spirits of sunset-clouds, the spirits of trees, Inspire the poet's song. He passes rapidly from sphere to sphere: The mountain-thunder now enthrals his ear; Next with the sea-wind's harp he dallies long. The dead hosts, myriads who have passed away, Are marshalled and divided. Some hosts sway The stormy purplest seas: Others, far inland in the forest-nooks, Rule only flowers and birds and rippling brooks And the thyme-scented breeze. The mortal poet, as from sphere to sphere Upon our earth he passes, now can hear The gentler dead hosts speak: Next full of lordly triumph, he bestows Large speech and song's divine relief on those Whose spirits haunt clouds, mist, and mountain-peak. Therefore his heart is diverse, and his strain Diverse—charged now with a tremendous pain, The anguish of the dead: Next winged amid the woods, and light as air, And buoyant as that butterfly poised there Upon the thistle-head. Wild spirits' jealous outcries fill the breeze: “Sing us,” they say, “before thou singest these;” “Is not my wave-breast white?” The ocean-spirit says. “Hath not my face, Full of soft forest-beauty, yet more grace?” The forest-spirit asks with laughter light. “One sonnet!” begs the fairy of the rose. “Once let me speak in song that throbs and glows!” The battle-spirit craves. Dead Cromwell yearns for utterance. Heaven and hell Have each their calm or bitter tale to tell: Each claims its own song-staves. In every varying spot, in each new place, The poet's singing changes heart and face. He meets beside the foam The passionate form of Venus, still as young As when the eager waves that round her clung Were altered, wave by wave, to white flower-bloom. He meets again by yonder vine-tressed hill Dante. His heart can sympathize and thrill At a great city's pain. In Paris blood-red revolution sweeps Superb and dread before his eyes,—then leaps In fierce song from his brain. TO ? The light of mountains, and the light of skies, Will fade out swiftly from before thine eyes: No more, blue seas will break. Cast off thy faith in heaven! The earth will fade. Cease to believe in love! No sunlit glade Will laugh and gleam and brighten for thy sake Thou standest now in deadly peril, friend.— Lose faith in God and woman—all things end; All things at least for thee. Thy poethood, so sweet and pure and strong; The might and force and manhood of thy song; Thy heart's communion with the stars and sea; These things depend on purity of heart. Lose faith in woman; desecrate thine art By low base dreams of her; Pollute thy poethood by thoughts untrue— At the same moment all the sea's wide blue Thou dost defile and change and blot and blur! Nature and God and woman,—these are one. Thy worship of the rose and of the sun, And of the hills and skies, This worship in thy heart is based indeed On faith in heaven and God. Renounce thy creed, And lo! that moment thy pure genius dies. Pause—pause in time. Thou hast the power to teach,— To lift men higher. Thou hast power to reach The fair heights of the Ideal. Defile not thus thy soul with thoughts impure. Lose not thy faith in woman. Be thou sure, Whatever else is false, her love is real. Put doubt and sorrow from thee. Linger not In that malarious and ill-omened spot Where now thy tired feet stand. Shake off the oppressing chains! Be once again A poet-flame, a light to lesser men; A light of song to lighten all the land. “THE PURE IN HEART” The beauty of little things we never see; The beauty of one leaf upon a tree Where thousands wave: The beauty of one shell upon the beach Where thousands crackle at our tread, yet each Buries a sunset in its spiral cave. The olive-green sea-weed upon the shore, Strewing the shingly sunlit briny floor, With sunlight cast Through the bright fronds: the stretch of white chalk cliff: The white foam-streak behind the arrowy skiff: The yellow moon against the tapering mast: It needs a pure fresh heart to see these things. To catch the music of the west wind's wings The soul must be Freed from harsh labour and laborious care: Then can it drink the beauty of moonlit air And apprehend the message of the sea. So with large things. Until the soul is pure God is not seen, nor can the light allure That clothes the line Of the next world's high hill-tops. Nor can she, Woman, whose soul is like the sky or sea, Be apprehended save by love divine. Who would see God, or woman, or the next World—yes, or even understand the text Of hills or plains— Must purify his inward vision first. Never God's beauty yet, nor woman's, burst Upon the soul that selfishness enchains. A rose to one man's insight is a rose: A woman just a supple form that goes Along the street. But to the pure in heart a rose's breath Is woman's. Rose and woman smile at death. Rose, woman, God, are equal, being so sweet. THE BACKGROUND OF LANDSCAPE The sweet face loved within the city's smoke Is not the face that, under birch or oak, The poet loves and sings. The wingless love of cities changes form When mixed with ardour of the wild sea-storm, And takes the sea-bird's wings. This gives to love its splendour and its bloom, This, the background of landscape. Love for home Hath all the world indeed. The maiden loved within a wood of firs Is not the maiden of the lone hill-spurs Or austere mountain-mead. Change place, change power of loving.—Each new place Hath its presiding tutelary grace, Its woman-spirit there. The bower of roses gives the poet love: But lordlier passion thrills the peaks above And the large roseless air. The quiet garden gives the poet rest; The spot where, lip to lip, and breast to breast, Lilies and wall-flowers grow: But passion revels 'mid the curves of seas, Deeper and vaster than the waves of trees, Crested with furious snow. So who would make the landscape of his heart Superb in aspect, perfect in each part, Must add pure line to line: Must love not only maidens of the sea But maidens born where the cloud-shadows flee O'er rolling slopes of pine. Thus varying Nature adds a nameless charm To beauty of dark eyes and curve of arm: In each place each is new. Nor did yon beechwood ever seem so fair As when we met that mountain-maiden there With eyes of mountain-blue. For woman adds to Nature charm as well. She adds the witchery to the ferny dell: Without her all is nought. Without the brightness of her eyes, the night Misses and mourns its stars. The lily white With lovelier touch she wrought. She gives and she receives. The charm is hers In truth that adds such magic to those firs Upon the green hill-side. The laughter of those branches in the woods Follows and corresponds to all her moods, Her love, her joy, her pride. When boyhood's simpler hours are left behind, The man at first seems deaf and dull and blind To Nature's unchanged grace. The boy saw wondrous beauty in the woods: The man sees only leafy solitudes; He longs for form and face. But, later on, he catches further sight Of woman—feels her in the snow-storm white, In the hills' starlit sleep. His growing worship of the royal rose Is worship of the royal mouth that glows Within the petals deep. Never again is Nature wholly free From woman now. Man knows her in the sea, For Venus nestled there. Man feels with magic and unspoken thrill Her beauty in the beauty of the hill, Her charm i'the sunset air. Nature is woman's minister and slave. The man resumes the worship that he gave To Nature in years gone by. He takes his homage back from flower and tree And sunlit lake and thunder-shadowed sea And star-embroidered sky. He takes again the worship that he gave: The lovely silver laugh o'the leaping wave To woman he transfers. She is the universe: she sways the whole. For her the waters lift their tides and roll. The witching moon is hers. All things are hers, her own, by day, by night. The man again revels in Nature's light, But now loves what he knows. The flowers are no more what the boy's heart dreamed For something sweeter than the rose has gleamed As it were within the rose. SOUL TO SOUL, IN HELL This damns our souls, this keeps us ever apart, Apart from life and blue seas and the sun, This,—that we slew an ever-trusting heart: This damns us,—this vast evil we have done. We,—you and I who in this weary hell Gaze at each other with love-lacking eyes,— Had once the chance to do supremely well, Yet did supremely, foully, otherwise. In seeking love, we lied to love. We lied Each to the other, when we lied to her. She might have climbed to heaven's heights at our side: We trod her into hell. Did we not err? Did we not sin beyond all mortal thought, Beyond redemption, in our ghastly dream? We longed to crown ourselves. A crown we wrought; But with her blood its hellish blossoms gleam! That was our love, our passion—to create An endless sorrow for a child to bear: To make our “love” to her seem Satan's hate: To turn her trust to limitless despair. This was our love, our worship of the Lord. And lo! the Lord in whose high name we swore Stood in our pathway with a fiery sword And barred us back from Eden evermore. So great we were,—in our own thought so grand! So far above, beyond, the vulgar throng! And yet the humblest heart in all the land Would not have done a child this deadly wrong. We thought to win each other,—and our doom Is endless separation, endless loss. Our bridal-chamber changes to a tomb Which holds the form we nailed upon her cross. GENIUS No mother owns a son.—Their lives are drawn Together for a time. O'er valley and lawn Of this our earth they pass. But as they older grow, their spheres divide: One seeks by choice the ice-blue mountain-side: The other loves the daisied sunlit grass. Many have lived before. Christ had derived From many a star wherein his soul had lived Soul-learning, lessons high: Perhaps had suffered for another race; Others perhaps had loved the royal face; Another cross perhaps had seen him die. And this is genius.—Genius has rehearsed In other lives its tasks, performed them first In other lands than these. On other azure waters Shelley sailed Long ere his watchful guardian-spirit failed To gauge the peril of the Spezzian breeze. Genius has lived and loved. Its head is hoar With strange experience. Centuries before Its birth, it toiled and dreamed. No Phidias ever carved, no Titian drew, Save from remembrance of an art they knew Long ere the earthly stone or canvas gleamed. And so with love.—What draws our spirits close Is just remembrance. Lo! this scent of rose Upon the bridal night That floats with sudden sweetness through the room Brings back the faint remembrance of love-bloom Gathered in regions far beyond man's sight. This subtle scent that in the girl's loose hair Startles her lover—till his thoughts despair, They wander back so far! What is it but the memory of an hour When she perhaps, ensphered within a flower, Made sweet with that same scent some ancient star? This is what draws our souls together,—this. Not the lips' pressure, but the former kiss Repeated once again. All perfect love is memory, nothing more. Remembrance of a rapture known of yore: A pleasure our souls wrestle to retain. DOUBLE PICTURES I This silent river flows in channel deep: Along its margin giant elm-trees sleep, Immersed in dreams. It breathes the placid and thyme-scented air: Past sedges bright and rushes debonair Its blue wave gleams. II A foam-belled mountain streamlet leaps along Its rocky banks with swift defiant song, Past boulders springs. Its rippling waters, crystal-pure gold-brown, Come bubbling, boiling, eddying, splashing, down: The moor-side rings. I This Southern girl's heart changes like the stream: Yet how divine, how perfect, is the dream That rests and sleeps Within her marvellous eyes. Half cruel, she Is passion's queen and slave,—yet quite love-free, For all she weeps. II An English girl, deep-hearted, silent, strong, Is like the river-wave that flows along, Calm, hastening never. Her love once given, is given. Is passion slow To dawn? Yet, when she loves, for weal or woe She loves for ever. SELF-FORGETFULNESS This is the secret of triumphant Art,— To lose itself in Nature, pour its heart Upon the winds away. Not to turn pale-hued at the storm-blast's drum, Nor bugles of the wild waves when they come Fanfaring past the headland grey. To lose its single self, and to suspire With Nature's breath; to know the cloud's desire, The life of stars and trees; To hold itself suspended in the mid Large tide of things; to lurk most safely hid Within the soft plumes of the breeze; This is the life of Art, the life of man: This is the immortal life that ne'er began Nor has it end nor break. We are constituents of the deathless whole. To every golden star the human soul Is linked. The sun shines for our sake. What heart can dread the billows fierce and strong Who hears behind their blue-green ranks the song Of One who leads their charge? What human soul can sink to final death Beneath their tides, if that soul breathes the breath Of deathless God through soul-lungs large? The lightning is our own. We tame its wings, And lo! our messages of love it brings Along the safe straight wire. We use the very force whose flash perturbs.— We make the poison-hearted sluggish herbs Lull human pain at our desire. Nought fails us. Straight down history's iron grooves A spirit cognate to our own heart moves: His dwelling-place is ours. If we once lose ourselves in his superb Vast life, we win the force to chain and curb The giant elemental powers. All loss of self is gain. Love is just this— Not the mere single isolated kiss, Though every kiss is sweet, But the reception through a woman's eyes Of a new life, as self shrinks up and dies: Heaven opens, when two spirits meet. SIN,—AND FORGIVENESS A gift was given us once, a gift most rare, To keep: A child, with God's own sunshine in her hair And God's own heart of love most pure and deep. We understood her not. Her ways were not Like ours. We understood her not, because she brought Held tight in childish hands heaven's unknown flowers. And, seeing that her flowers were not of earth Indeed, We pained her soul and mocked her simple mirth And called her choicest flower a worthless weed. Her choicest sweetest flower was perfect trust, Sublime: A flower whose roots rebel against earth's dust And sickly sand and waste infertile slime. This flower from heaven we wildly cast away: We slew Her childlike faith. What searching hand to-day Shall find so sweet a flower where that plant grew? We thought because the flower was pure and white And frail, Dreading excess of heat and ardent light, That therefore was its scent of small avail. But we know better now. The angels sought And seized What first in heaven by sinless hands was wrought: With what we heeded not God's heart was pleased. We would not have her flowers. She bore them back To heaven: Yet, passing, dropped one love-flower on the track That we who slew might know ourselves forgiven. AFTER WEARY YEARS When after weary years the poet dies His chant will still add colour to the skies And paint the sea-line blue. Pure souls shall purer be; the strong more strong. Young hearts will leap with rapture at his song To whom the world is new. Never one shell upon the golden shore But shall be brighter, freaked and tinted more With rose-light, in that he Watched with sad heart the slowly sinking sun On many an evening when his toil was done Over its parent sea. For all his sorrow past, the future gains. Its joys are deepest for his deepest pains. It reaps the corn he sowed.— A girl's eyes flash with light? That light has leapt Straight from his song.—A weary soul has slept? He lifted that heart's load.— Through him the seasons smile, the blossoms bloom. But he,—he sleeps so quiet in the tomb; All round him spreads the dim Night of the dead. Man he has raised indeed; Laid the foundations of the future's creed; But, just God, what of him? TRUE KINGSHIP Not those who hold earth's thrones are rightful lords,— Propped up by brainless and subservient hordes, And fenced by walls of steel. These are not the true kings whose sovereign grace Reveals God's kingship to the human race, To whom the ages kneel. The highest king of earth, who sways wide lands And grips blind millions as with iron bands, When once his foot is set Upon the irreparable spirit-shore May find himself a human being, no more— May find his kingship pending even yet. WOMAN, AND GENIUS Not genius, genius needs. The fiery touch of genius would exhaust Genius; 'twas Margaret who conquered Faust. Where genius fails, the simpler heart succeeds. The heart that saves the heart Wherethrough the wild poetic fire-throbs beat Is not the heart wherethrough likewise there fleet Strange fevering dreams of life, and dreams of Art. The heart that saves is this— The heart that represents in simplest guise Woman. God's light must shine within her eyes; God's love must hallow her undoubting kiss. The simplest singlest heart, This saves the poet,—not the complex brain, But woman; simply she; and she again. She, being herself, transcends all heights of Art. LOVE'S TEACHING Thy life has not been wasted. Thou hast taught Truths beyond thought, Sweet sacred truths beyond my dream, to me. Truths not one other woman could have told Thy lips unfold. Blind was I. Thou hast taught my soul to see. For this I owe Thanks infinite. For this I love thee so, That thou hast shown me woman's heart indeed,— So fair and sweet, So far beyond a poet's dreams of it, So far above man's common thoughtless creed. Ah! never think thy life is wasted, dear. It blossoms here; 'Twill blossom tenfold when thy work is done, And when beyond these earthly scenes we go To grasp and know Joys that on earth can only half be won. God surely sent Thy soul to teach love's stormless deep content To me, thou haven of a poet's soul! For this great end, Love, sweetheart, lady, truest dearest friend, He gave my spirit into thy control. A WOMAN'S HEART What gift is there that time cannot replace, Not all its grace, Not all the sundry gifts and dowers of time,— A sweeter thing Than all the seasons bring, Than suns' and moons' and stars' gifts more sublime? What gift is there which, if once flung away, Nought can repay, Not all the silent years of loss and grief,— Not heaven indeed, Nor any faith nor creed, Nor summer's bloom, nor autumn's golden leaf? What gift is there which God himself once deigned, Since man complained Of lonely life and of his daily task, With his own hands To bring the sorrowing lands That groaned and grieved, yet knew not what to ask? What gift is there beyond which lies a gloom Deep as of tomb,— No hope, no sunrise, should its light depart? The gift is this— A noble woman's kiss, The perfect love of a good woman's heart. THE STATUE White, pure, superb, entrancing to the eye, What living form can emulate or vie With this divine Psyche? Greek art is just the soul of God made clear, Undraped,—his message to the human ear Fresh from his burning lips eternally. In the white perfect figure, nobly shaped, Revealed for ever, beautiful, undraped, Unmarred, unstained, divine, There is a gospel hidden. If we will seek, God preaches through the stately curve of cheek And through each limb's inevitable line. This is God's gospel written in white stone.— Not on the Sinaitic Mount alone He thundered, through the storm. He speaks to mankind's spiritual sense Through beauty, and through the mystery intense That seems to robe an unrobed perfect form. UNCONSCIOUS TEACHING The thoughts that trouble poets vex not thee: Thy purity Lifts thee for ever to a higher air. Above the mists of life and all its gloom Thou see'st the bloom In blue skies of the star-flowers clustered there. We weary souls must struggle, ere we reap; Toil, ere we sleep; But thou without an effort enterest straight The golden palace-doors that we unclose By fierce wild blows; At thy mere hand-touch opens wide the gate. Thou art so close to heaven and God indeed That book nor creed Thou needest. Thine own soul is so divine Thou findest ready-graved and written there Commandments fair, Pure law by law, and sacred line by line. If I would learn of God, I come to thee And then I see Straightway what long strange epochs could not reach. Through thee, so simply sweet, I apprehend Life's high true end And learn as thine eyes, all unconscious, teach. RENUNCIATION Man fears sometimes lest, giving up too much, Things sweet to touch, Things sweet to see, things lovely to possess, He may, perhaps, proceed a step too fast, And, yielding, cast Upon God over-labour, over-stress. “If I give up my dearest heart's desire, Can God inspire His world mine abnegation to repay? I yield my snowdrop. Can the Lord disclose A queenly rose Whose glory of bloom may light my wandering way? “Or am I casting overmuch of weight, A care too great, Upon the Maker of all stars and flowers? I shrink from giving up this longed-for thing Lest I should fling On God the burden of dark anxious hours. “Each joy we quit for God, each deed we do Noble and true For his sake, claims its final just reward. Sometimes to pass through self-denial's gate I hesitate, Lest I increase sums owed me by the Lord. “The countless orbs are his,—star beyond star Careering far Through regions infinite of purpling air. Yet can God cash me my one small star-cheque, Or will it wreck The starlit bank of God, presented there?” BEYOND, EVER BEYOND Beyond the outline of the furthest star It may be, new star-globes and sun-globes are, Full of new life and force. Past these again new systems, and past these Eternal ever-blossoming galaxies That urge through the blue depths their fiery course. In each star human beings there may be, And forests full of many a giant tree, And ardent great new flowers, And tides gigantic, plunging through the deep Of oceans beating on vast shores asleep And dull and reckless of the waves like ours. The sun itself, our sun, hurls from its heart Titanic flames aloft. They upward dart, Hundreds of miles on high. They shoot, red-flickering, through the enormous space So tall they almost lick the next star's face And almost traverse the unmeasured sky. There may be stars that sway as many moons As we see stars. The human weak thought swoons Before the space profound. Our sun (and we too) may be whirling fast Around some unseen sun,—careering past Its unseen golden orb without a sound. All stars we see may be but one small part Of wide creation. All perhaps may dart, All star-ships in full sail, Around some central sun; and this, maybe, Round other suns to all eternity; Sun beyond sun, till brain and eye-ball fail. Gods behind gods, vast rulers, there may be: Some gods to whom is given to rule the sea, And some to rule the air. Each star may have a ruler, and each sun A ruler; or huge depths may own but one Monarch, whose power no rival thrones impair. Beyond Christ, God.—And, beyond God again, New Gods of more Titanic heart and reign: Beyond these we may find New star-gods, ruling depths we cannot see: God behind God to all eternity, Just as each star suggests a star behind. The Ruler of this earth, this speck in space, May be subservient to the sun-god's face, A tributary lord. Account he renders often, it may be, Of his great dealings with our land and sea To the higher God, for judgment or reward. The God of the gold-tressed gigantic sun May be a mere proconsul-god to one Who rules beyond his gaze: God behind God, and dream beyond our dream, Till the stern eyes of far-off rulers gleam So faint, they seem like stars in the sea-haze. THE BORDER-BATTLE Yes, weary it is. The days are full of sighing.— Close to our hands the remedy is lying, The cure for sorrow and care. Stretch out thine hand. The poison-draught is ready. See how below that bridge the dark waves eddy! Are not sleep's lips of all lips the most fair?— So pleads the inner voice with dangerous pleading. And yet the soul is great which, rent and bleeding, Lives on and on and on. “Great souls are strong to live.” Great past our knowing Is the brave soul who lives, when hope seems going Where all youth's joys and rainbow-dreams have gone. When hopes and joys and friends have crossed the border, Most great is he who, following out God's order, This side the boundary stands Safeguarding their retreat with sword undying And mighty heart, and deathless self-relying Strong fearless hands. As yet no right is ours to cross life's limit. The stream runs there. We may not ford or swim it, Nor follow our friends, nor cry. Silent we stand, our faces lifeward turning: We may not yet indulge the soul's deep yearning: We must not die. The great soul trusts. The great soul waits, in quiet, Though round him rings the unceasing border-riot Of the red steely storm. He waits till through the dawn, or through the gloaming, He hears the tramp of the relief-guard coming And sees their Leader's form. THE VOYAGE OF DEATH Just as the traveller, putting forth from land At sunset, sees the waste on either hand Widen, and sees the shore Slowly diminish, till the last land-breeze Brings the last scent of thyme and scent of trees,— One faint waft, then no more: As the night darkens slowly, and the coast Becomes a faint far shadow, while the host Of waters wails around; As still the darkness deepens, till the sail Stands out alone against the sky—one pale Ghost on the black background: As next the gold stars one by one appear, While the moon dominates with silver sphere The darkness wide and deep; As we forget the flower-delights of land, Holding new star-companions by the hand, While worlds awake from sleep: So life starts from green shores and early vales Full of the scent of thyme, and rich with tales Of youthful fairy-lore; So life trends outward, till the deepening blue Wild waters thrill the heart with laughter new That answers sail or oar. So life steers onward, till the ghostly land Glimmers far-off, while strips of yellow sand Shine faintly through the haze; Till on a sudden stars and moon seem close To the white sail, and sea-wind round us blows, Not land-wind of the bays. Then first with awe we face the silent night; But afterward with solemn deep delight, Delight that ever grows: For love seems nearer. If our souls give ear, Love speaks through starlit waves with voice more clear Than through the sunlit rose. Love still is with us in the lonely night; Though stars and moon and waters and the white Sail are our only friends. Love still pervades this awe-inspiring realm, And still Love's hand is at the vessel's helm, And still Love's song ascends. Then, as the sense of earth-life fades away, Glimmers a faint pure line of distant grey In front: the dawn is near— The golden morning in whose ardent rays A new land, with new cliffs and green-blue bays, Will make its outline clear. The middle sea is death. The morning-land, Full of flower-scents and rich with golden sand Along its sunlit marge, Is the new morning-life towards which we haste, Travelling across the moonlit landless waste, The flowerless meads and large. Death's agony, its central pang, is this— The old thyme-scent upon life's shores to miss Ere we can trust the new Eternal sweet illimitable grand Wild waste of water,—ere the morning-land Lifts its faint peaks of blue. This is the agony. But trust the deep; The stars and waves that through their haunted sleep Murmur and chant and pray. Then sweeter than life's cliffs with all their bloom Shall be death's waves, for just beyond their gloom Lies unimagined day. THE DEPTH OF HELL Where heaven exists, there must be also hell.— When royal Guinevere succumbed and fell, O singer of Arthurian days, Was there not scope for agony profounder Than if no love passing man's love had crowned her And led her steps through sunlit ways? In this one point, O poet whose golden tongue Has made the grey-haired far-off epochs young And filled them with immortal bloom— In this one point thou hast failed. Thou hast drawn love's magic, But not love's dark wherethrough there flash the tragic Unearthly lights of hell and doom. A rose once fallen, and smutched and soiled and stained, Is sadder than an oak-leaf sturdy-veined That falls, and little loss is there. Just in proportion to a woman's sweetness Is her great downfall's rigorous completeness, When hell breathes round with burning air. The inconceivable and hopeless change! The knowledge that, far as the eye can range, No pitying star will intervene: The bitter sense that God has here no power; That the mad deed of one bewildered hour Is ceaseless, since it once has been: The keen most clear inevitable sense That pain most deep, or sorrow most intense, Can never cleanse man's touch away: The passionate grasp of this one fact undying— That she in Lancelot's arms one night was lying; That in his arms again she lay: This knowledge would rise up till time had end. On either soul this knowledge would descend As the storm lowers on mountain land. The very Maker of the stars and seas, Who can uplift and change and govern these, Could not remove the mark of Lancelot's hand. This is the agony, the hell-deep wrong; And this, O great true poet, this thy song Softens and veils and half conceals:— The agony that through the day and night As sombre vast eternity took flight Would still stalk close at a doomed Arthur's heels. The agony whose changeless curse, it seems, Not God nor Christ can move—not even in dreams: The agony which grasps with grim Portentous grip that those lips kissed again Would never be the wife's. They would retain The touch of Lancelot, the savour of him. THE ETERNAL DEATH There is no death.—The death-deep awful gloom We see and dread Is not the real invincible fog-fume Round the death-bed. There is no death, no darkness. All is light. The deepest gloom Is not the murk impenetrable night Around the tomb. There is a deeper darkness than the dark Where no stars beam: A blackness where not one most faint star-spark Can ever gleam. Wrong-doing is death, and this alone is death. Death is sent here That we may shiver at his ice-cold breath And, shuddering, fear: But fear not him, but his similitude— The death more deep Than ever mortal dreamed, the death more rude Than deathlike sleep. The death we, and we only, can create; The death we bring By fraud and selfishness and wrath and hate And misdoing. This is the eternal death. The other death Is just a change, A sudden dreamlike passage underneath A process strange. And all that gives it horror, steeps in gloom Earth's golden springs, Is but a symbol of the eternal doom Wrong-doing brings. MAN AND GOD Far through the stars the human heart can reach And mark the waves on some celestial beach Breaking, along the night. Our human deeds affect the furthest stars— Change to blood-red the leaves in iron Mars, Or change the colours of the rings and bars That Saturn bears, storm-bright. Our actions bound before us into space: Not one far heavenly spectral dwelling-place Lambent amid the gloom But burns with deeper or with fiercer hue For the misdeeds and sins of me or you; The comet-birds who haunt the enormous blue Heaven-sea, our crimes displume. The whole is one.—A single act of will (God cannot stay it) mounts the purple hill, Climbs the stupendous night, And, having struggled up the heavenly stair And passed right through the star-impeded air, Impinging on the farthest star-cliff there Fringes its base with white. Such air-waves are our deeds. God cannot stay The airy course they take. From day to day We mould all things anew. One woman ruined in an English town Alters the fashion of the dainty crown Some far star-blossom bears, and sends a moan For leagues across the blue. The solitude is peopled with our deeds.— Not words and thoughts, and hopes and fears, and creeds, Not these make history grow. Our actions build the stars, and make all space Fit either for the high God's dwelling-place Or a vast dungeon where our own disgrace Fiendlike tramps to and fro. The slightest noble deed is felt to-day, Though it took place in far-off ages grey. The woman who first clung To the wild dream of woman's purity Passed to the dark unhonoured; and yet she, None other, saith to her sisters “Ye are free” To-day, and speaks our tongue. The singer hidden in the years unknown Who first had eyes to see and soul to groan For woman unredeemed Passed,—yet his soul is seen in woman's eyes To-day, when through them gleams the light of skies Pure, sweet, unstained, unsullied. In like wise They dream, as once he dreamed. One royal act, one regal stroke of will, Can quite remake the universe,—can thrill The farthest bounds of space. The seas are only blue as we design; Ours is the sketch, though God's is the outline; We grant their fruitage to the corn and vine; We mould and shape the race. And our immortal life is in our hand Likewise. Fate hath no force that can withstand The human force of will. God gives the power to wrench the bolts aside And force an entrance large, an entrance wide, Into the deathless house death will provide: Death has no power to kill. God reaches us, and rules us. And we reach The Lord of all the stars. Our broken speech Can move the King of kings. Not only we are governed; we affect God by our will, and force him to reject This or that plan. We force him to select New modes and motive-springs. We act upon the stately will of God; Force it sometimes to choose another road. We, gnats who dance in space, Can none the less affect the central Power: We, creatures whose life lasts one short sweet hour, We, more ephemeral far than the June-flower, Can stir God's dwelling-place. We can so rule our daily devious way That in the end the Lord cannot but say, “This soul must pass the gloom: New labour waits beneath another sun This pale ephemeral, whose one life is done.” This life is ended, when the right is won To disregard the tomb. GOD AND MAN Our minor daily acts are in our hand To do, or not to do. Our deeds are planned Slowly from day to day. We fix the hour for meeting with a friend. We bring our mapped-out labour to an end. We speak. The months obey. The human will is free. Yes, free indeed! Along its woodland path it can proceed, Dealing with wood-side flowers. It gathers here a pink anemone And there a blue-bell, bluer than the sea In its most sunlit hours. The human will appoints its daily track; Climbs the steep mountain,—loiters, or turns back; The human heart is proud: It says, “I will, or will not do this thing;” It says, “I will see Venice in the spring:” Its laugh is long and loud. “This woman I will love,—or here abstain:” “Here I will yield me to sweet passion's reign,— There exercise control:” “To-day dark hair allures me,—but to-night Strange tresses golden-pure or auburn-bright May magnetise my soul.” Ah! so God lets the human spirit dream. He lets us revel in the silver gleam Of the electric light: Then on a sudden through the night's blue damp Flashes his heavenly mountain-shadowed lamp, His moon, full on our sight. He watches us illume pale town on town When dying sunset steals away its crown Of colours from the air; He marks our glow-worm lamps through street on street Crawl slowly one by one, with flashing feet, Till legions glitter there: He watches through the night the yellow gas Flicker behind the dust-streaked London glass; He waits till all is done,— Then brings his single golden-armoured knight To quench ten million lustres with one light, Parades his conquering sun. He lets the human will create one flower; He lets us rear geraniums for one hour, Red petals and green stalks: He lets the human will and human hand Adorn a window-frame with bloom well planned, Or edge the garden walks: And then he spreads the countless tropic bloom As if in mockery through the tropic gloom Of forests dark and dim, Weird places never pierced by human eye, Designing all flower-souls to satisfy With the lone sight of him. The human will maps out futurity. “I love this maid. To-morrow she shall be For ever mine, I deem!” God at the very altar stands austere, Saying, in tones that thrill the human ear, “Your marriage is a dream.” God binds what we unbind, and setteth free What we would join.—We marry. Straightway he Annuls the marriage-bond. What we would seal as final, he unseals: Removes the mist of marriage, and reveals Limitless heights beyond. We plan—he finishes: commence—he ends. He takes the old, and gives our hearts new friends. He lifts the gloomy night Far from our gaze, and fills the sky and air With morning's golden rapture, and the fair Song of the new-born light. Again, when we are weary of the day, He hurls the burning ceaseless sun away And hangs in heaven the moon: He spreads across the solemn skies his peace Nocturnal,—darkens daylit towers and trees That stars may gem his throne. We make our strange machines, our doll-like toys: God's hand is stretched across the heavens, and buoys The stars whose wild prows race. We mould and shape our sculpture, wrought of stone: But God's triumphant sculptor-hand alone Could mould the model's grace. Our gods and heroes, full of strength and force, Ride down the road of time, that echoing course, With sword and shield and plume: Full of heroic fire of life are they; Souls reverenced by the race until to-day; Vast epochs they illume. We mould our leaders. We construct all these: Napoleon, Frederick, Ajax, Hercules, The Cæsars,—that wild line. But God constructed, at an epoch's close, The heart of Christ, and filled it with repose Ineffably divine. We plant one tree, and nurture it with care. In all stars God can make all seasons bear Their fruited stores of grain. Our tree has withered? Lo! a million springs Are bringing forth their green-leaved fosterlings Beneath his bounteous rain. We reap one field in autumn. Lo! God stands And reaps the far skies with immortal hands; The stars are as his sheaves: And the great comets plunging through the night, Whirling through ceaseless space with wild delight, Glean the lost stars he leaves. We toil all day, and through the midnight hours: We guard our lands with grey grim castle towers: We mark our frontier line. God sends his wild snow-warriors in the dark: Our lands are like the sea, without an ark— White wastes, from pine to pine! Our mortal armies meet. We deck them out— The glittering wrestlers close with curse and shout; Guns flash,—the quick swords gleam. But lo! God's moon beholds the hosts at night: Their strength is withered, and their lordly might Has faded like a dream. God's moon is still superb above the plain; But on the ground red heaps of cloth remain,— Red, mixed with green and blue. No eye can tell the Russian from the Turk; The Southern sword is as the Highland dirk, Wet with the same strange dew. All love, all life, God rules. We rule a part: But he with vigilant and ceaseless heart Observes and sways the whole.— A day's delight we plan. The vast surprise Of death he springs on us before the eyes Of our astonished soul. We hold the right to put to shameful death One crime-clad soul, to stay the mortal breath Of one man,—this is ours. But God? He can with one storm-blast unmake The living universe,—as we can shake One dewdrop from the flowers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. VIII TO MY FRIEND ARTHUR HERVEY I strive in verse to render forth the song Of life, to life's strange message I give heed: But where my Art is faulty, yours is strong, And where I fail, you triumph and succeed. For you in music render forth the psalm Of life, aye all its passion, all its power; Music can reproduce June's heavenliest calm When no breath stirs the frailest cliff-side flower. And music too can thunder like the seas: The world's emotion music can express: The saint's thoughts praying on his bended knees, The lover's thrill at beauty's first caress. Through music the one Spirit who sways the whole, Creates, pulls down, refashions and destroys, Speaks—ever music is the world's deep soul Uttering its giant sorrows, giant joys. From the first hour when on our planet-home Love spake, in depths of moonlit forest heard Or by some far-off sea's forgotten foam, Its priceless first unfathomable word, From that first hour hath music reigned supreme, For music's soul and passion's soul are one; And music still will reign while young hearts dream And while sweet darkness follows on the sun. All dim strange thoughts we struggle, and in vain, To utter—pangs and joys, and hopes and fears— In music their impassioned utterance gain; All human longings sound in human ears. The past grows vocal, history speaks once more. Above dense war-ranks nods Achilles' plume: Pale Dido weeps upon the loveless shore: Masked murder dogs love's steps through Venice' gloom. At music's touch man's visions all grow real; We see the matchless face that Bothwell saw:— We enter too the realms of the ideal, The mist-clad land where genius' will is law. A thousand fairies throng the wood-glades, white Beneath the rays of an enchanted moon; Their elfin cohorts flash upon our sight, Armoured in gems that mock the glittering noon. At music's summons Oberon's snowy steed Tramples the clover, jingling silver reins: When music sounds, an unseen world gives heed; Its starlight waxes as our sunlight wanes. While music sounds, no barrier to our hope Looms dark and threatening on the heavenward way, For music gives the glad soul boundless scope And points beyond the night to endless day. The Christian Church through music scales the skies: The humblest chapel built where wild waves foam On Cornish rocks, or where Welsh mountains rise, Through music conquers, even as mighty Rome. And love through music conquers—when we hear The haunting magic of some wondrous tune, Lost loves on golden wings come glimmering near And life's December is as passion's June. Dark eyes we never thought to see again In life shine forth, and speechless joys are won: Music can crowd with life death's ghostly plain And make night's dreams more cogent than the sun. Words—even Shakespeare's words—must sometimes fail, But music never fails: where man has trod It follows, gathering up life's tragic tale, Blending with man's the language of a god. And this immortal tongue is yours, O friend! While I must labour through the straits of rhyme And on my course a world of thought expend, Your Art is subject not to space or time. To you the lover, yearning to express Fancies that ravish, eager thoughts that thrill, Must turn; demanding love's own voice, no less, He finds your music's cadence tenderer still. Demanding passion's voice and soul of fire, He finds your music equal to his theme; Strong as deep love's illimitable desire, Sweet as love's truth, and ardent as its dream. Demanding that love's sadness shall prevail And that love's temple change into a tomb, Still can your varying music tell the tale Of deepening agony and starless gloom. To you for many a year will poets turn; Through you their thought that flagged wins timeless wings: Eyes soften at your strain, and men's hearts burn To whom in vain the unaided poet sings. When pen betrays and silent paper wrongs The poet, stealing witchery from his strain, Your touch brings victory; yes, to you belongs The triumph, and to him the priceless gain. Envious am I, stern fetters we must wear— What grim restraints the laws of verse impose! A flower described is only half as fair, But music adds a fragrance to the rose. And when across the heart life's tempest roars And desolation's trumpet-blast is blown, Music can catch the clash of echoing shores And make the night-wind's melody its own. If I could speak the thoughts that in my brain Struggle imprisoned, if on music's sea I once could launch forth, sail that stormy main, If speech and music wedded once might be, Then, then indeed, I might shake off time's yoke, Upon my brow the deathless stars might gleam: Alas, what poet ever fully spoke The mastering thought that held him like a dream? THE SUN The sun we see that with its fiery gleams Traverses heaven shall in the end maybe Bear life, become the home of human dreams,— Bear mountains, shadowy forests, shadeless sea. The races it shall bear through years of strife Shall struggle,—ships shall toss on snowier foam: Upon the sun, rich in majestic life, Shall rise new cities, spire and arch and dome. A thousand Venices shall lift their towers Upon the sun towards skies of ardent air: Deep groves shall foster unimagined flowers; Love's rapture shall awake—and love's despair. A thousand Londons there shall stream with life: Upon the vast sun's mightier fiery frame Shall seethe the currents of unmeasured strife, Fed by new gods of unknown power and name. Mars, born again, with eager bound shall leap Straight to the fray,—his crimson plume shall wave Where swords flash thickest and where blood runs deep: Huge ships shall founder in their starless grave. Venus again from bluer waves than ours Shall rise, beneath the light of lovelier skies, Her hair fresh-scented from a thousand flowers, With unborn centuries dreaming in her eyes. She, as she ruled on our poor mortal star, Upon the sun shall rule with queenlier sway; Make day's bright golden hours diviner far, And dark night's hours diviner than the day. Her shall the unseen amorous hosts aspire Beyond all gods to serve, through joy and pain, For still love's voice shall wake the unknown desire And love's sweet sorrow seem man's boundless gain. Romance, deep-buried when our own star died, Shall be reborn within the exalted sun, Reborn, and loved and crowned and deified, New combats fought and kinglier victories won. But still for ever shall the sense of love Old as the skies, in every flower reborn, Be mightiest power all living hearts to move, Ruling the clouds of night, the light of morn. A YOUNG GIRL'S DREAM Fair the world is, though the breezes of September O'er the moors and through the forest-alleys pass: Though the light of burning August we remember Is a light for ever lost to us, alas! Though the glory of the branches and the flowers Has for ever with the summer passed away, Love is living yet within the forest-bowers And his heart is still as tender as in May. Was the spring-time half as sweet to me, I wonder, When the pearly snowdrops peeped above the mould, When the green buds burst their wintry sheaths asunder And the crocus dared to don its crown of gold— When the sunlight flashed across the river-billows As the wild wind lashed them into stormy glee, And the branches dipping in them of the willows Deemed they dipped their grey-green leafage in the sea? Was the summer half as fair with all its gleaming Of the crimson fuchsias near our cottage gate? Summer—when the stars of midnight watched me dreaming At the window, when I left it whispered “Wait!” Summer—when the rose with passion seemed to languish And the lily sighed her love-tale to the rose; When the world's heart scorned the very thought of anguish And its spirit was a spirit at repose. Summer—when I wondered, wondered, looking forward, Who would love me, strove to picture and divine; Started at a fancied footstep, gazing doorward,— Sat in fancy, often, with his hand in mine: Summer—when my heart knew little as I wandered Counting blossoms, watching butterfly and bee, Knew so little of the love-lore that it pondered, Knew so little, O my lover-soul, of thee! Was the summer half as lovely as the season That brings perfect love and passion to my heart? Let the blossoms madden at September's treason! Pangless I can watch their glowing tints depart. For my heart and all its thoughts are given over To my darling, and there's summer in his gaze: Let the lily go in mourning for her lover! All my heart is full of dreams of summer days. All my heart is full of dreams of love and heaven; God is good to me, aye good to me indeed: Love for teacher and for prophet he has given, Love for sermon and for bible and for creed. I was lonely in the wild world, I remember, Lonely through the leafy balmy days of June; I am happy and companioned in September; Envious, doubtless, is the silver lonely moon. Envious doubtless are the sea-birds on the ocean: On the tossing waters where have they to rest? Round them stretch the waves in ceaseless angry motion, Where is any nook for haven or for nest? Envious, doubtless, are the stars i' the airy spaces; Leagues they are from any loving star apart; Lonely sail they, leagues from love in starry faces, But my darling has his dwelling in my heart. He will raise me, he will lift me by his passion Towards a region wholly pure and wholly fair: We shall love with angels' love in holiest fashion, Yet find sweetness in the old earth's summer air. We will visit all the old earth's sacred places And in every land be happy and at home, Knit in union closer for the stranger faces; Dream in Paris, pass our honeymoon in Rome. We will wander hand in hand, with love and slowly, Through the cornfields and the towns of Palestine; Fancy that we see the eyes of Jesus holy, Dream we hear the voice most tender and divine. We, the children of the dark-blue Northern ocean, Born in mist-land, loved and nurtured by the sea; In the sunny East will gaze with deep emotion On sunstricken leafless drear Gethsemane. All our life will be the better for the glory That once shone through Jesus' figure and his face; Better shall we understand the sweet old story When we see with tearful eyes the very place, As we say, “Beneath this heaven of cloudless weather Wandered Jesus, here he prayed and here he spoke”— We shall wander through the vineyards, we together, Where his loving heart grew weary, where it broke. Though the beauty and the glamour have departed, Doubtless, from the fields and hills that Jesus saw, Yet we'll gaze with love upon them, tender-hearted, And with something still within the soul of awe: For the paths that God as perfect man hath taken Must for ever gleam with wonder, where he trod Still the human heart with love and faith unshaken Will behold the man,—beholding him, the God. We will trace in fancy spots he may have cherished, Say, “This corner of a vineyard he held dear:” See in fancy the lone hill-side where he perished And the rock-tomb whence his risen voice rang clear. “Here,” we say, “the loving sad disciples wept him; Here they laid his silent body to repose, Deeming that the eternal darkness would have kept him Sleeping ever; here they marvelled, when he rose.” Here our cottage has been home to me, and pleasure, Priceless happiness of girlhood, I have known: To my mother been her darling, her one treasure, Made my father's life less weary, less alone. —Now my life at last will leave the lowly places, Break to noble freedom, burst its prison bars; But for ever I shall love the dear lost faces, Love them as the golden morning loves the stars! I will tell my husband many a simple story; He will listen, for he loves me, to my tale: Tell him of our dear old garden's summer glory, From my girlish dreaming draw aside the veil— Tell him how I wandered through the hazel cover Dreaming of him, dreaming of him by the lake; How I longed to be of service to my lover, How I yearned to give my life-blood for his sake. Foolish dreams, it may be,—weak and very girlish; Yet they have their beauty and value, let them be! The vast ocean is not angry, is not churlish: Let the river sing its ditty to the sea! Let the river tell its quiet tales and simple Of the blossoms growing in the inland nooks, Though the sea receive with hardly a surface-dimple All the life-throbs of a thousand eager brooks. All my thoughts and dreams are his and he will treasure Touch them tenderly, transfigure one by one All my girlish hopes and every girlish pleasure, As the shadowy vales are lighted by the sun. All my friends are his—he'll make me love them better, Never rob me of the true heart of a friend; Make me faithful to each promise to the letter, Make me cling to father and mother to the end. All the children shall be happy at our wedding! (They will miss their girlish teacher's loving rule)— While another path and happier I am treading, They will tread the worn old pathway to the school; To the same old school with honeysuckle clinging Round the doorway and festooning from the eaves— I shall often hear the hymn that they are singing, Hear their fingers rustle through their lesson-leaves. I shall see them trotting underneath the larches, See them in their scarlet tippets and their hoods, See them enter 'neath the school-house' grey-stone arches, Hear their laughter in the playground of the woods: Hear some tiny child's glad cry of sudden pleasure When he spies the first blue egg within the nest, Gathers up with careful hands his turquoise-treasure, Shows it, full of lordly triumph, to the rest. I shall see the first rich golden daffodilly Don its gorgeous glittering raiment on the bank, Mark the snow-white wedding-garment of the lily, Stand again upon our brook-bridge—just a plank— Marking, as the gentle West wind lightly winnows The dark leafage of the rustling alder-tree, Half a hundred darting gleaming saucy minnows Make believe that they are salmon in the sea! Then, that every thought and dream may be the sweeter, I will turn to him, my husband and my friend: How the present joy will make the past completer! How the early days will sanctify the end! Passing from my pleasant dream of days behind me, Dream of English gardens, English hill and sky, Golden splendid Southern sunlight will remind me That I'm dreaming on the shores of Italy! Then a loving kiss will bring me to my senses; I must leave the children, leave them far away, Leave them labouring over nouns and verbs and tenses, Leave them lonely at their labour and their play: I must leave them, for my husband's voice is calling; Leave the tender lovely dreams of early life; See the curtain o'er the girl's work swiftly falling— There's a grander mission waiting for the wife! THE FEAST OF LANTERNS I. THE LANTERNS One evening, weary in brain and sad of heart, I strolled along a sea-front—watched the tide, Saw golden sunset glitter, then depart While raven darkness spread her mantle wide. But in that hour my soul was left alone, Unloved of night, unsolaced of the sea: I turned aside, and lo! a garden shone With glittering lanterns strung from tree to tree. I entered, and through all my heart there rushed The sense of youth and gladness once again: Half pleased, yet half in very truth I blushed To think how slight a salve cures human pain! I had been sad at heart, but here was light, Warmth, colour—pain had loosed its strangling hold:— The dark trees framed more star-lamps than the night; Their branches flashed with gems, or burned with gold. Then, in that mood in which one takes account Of little things and lets all great cares flee, I let my gaze from lawn to terrace mount, From bush illumed to lamp-bedizened tree. My fancy revelled in the fiery gleams Of Eastern colour from the lanterns flung; There mixed a thousand artists' wayward dreams Love-tales unheard and Epics never sung. There crimson mandarins put emerald flocks Of huge Satanic cranes to shameful flight, And gorgeous fishes cruised amid blue rocks, Golden, with eyes whence flashed unearthly light. Pale black-capped soldiers, massed in threatening groups, Loomed fierce upon the lanterns,—pig-tailed kings, And executioners, red-handed troops, And giant butterflies with jewelled wings. Knives raised from severed necks yet dripped with gore; Delicious damsels, dainty, almond-eyed, Ogled their swains; upon a yellow shore Strange painted junks lay basking in their pride. Grim hieroglyphics, Chinese down-strokes, meant No doubt, “I love you—all my heart is thine!” —While over all flowed soft the mystic scent The night-wind culls from heliotrope and pine. Then 'mid that maze of sweet bewildering light The fears that silence lovers fled away, And young hearts gathered courage from the night Who found no words nor courage in the day. And there were shadowy places, bowers apart, Where lovers quitting lamp-land for awhile, Might interchange the thoughts of heart and heart, With ardour plead, or vanquish with a smile. There some who had dreamed for years yet never won The gift of one soft tress, one treasured flower, Tongue-tied beneath the harsh gaze of the sun, Found passionate words within the kindly bower. And lips too coy by day to yield their fill Of sweetest ecstasy and pure delight Bent forward eager answering lips to thrill, Full of the balm and magic of the night. Eyes which by day were cowards were braver now And dared within the shadowy bowers to gleam, Full of the light that makes the lover vow That but for love's light star-land were a dream! And tender tongues, sweet cowards alas! by day, Won from the stars the mandate to be bold, Heedless what jewels of speech they flung away, What lovely word-gems of seductive gold. For round about the thousand lanterns gleamed; Upon the leafy boughs they gently swung: Of fairy-land all fervent young hearts dreamed, And old hearts dreamed of days when they were young. Then underneath two elms whose verdant gloom Shadowed a mimic stage, a play began. The armoured hero tossed his snowy plume: The villain of the piece disclosed his plan. A play wins magic from the soft night air, Steals glamour from surroundings such as these; The lovely village-maid seems twice as fair Beneath the actual shadow of living trees. The courtly dame of passionate romance Seems twice as courtly, more romantic far, When o'er real leaves her lover's steps advance And through real branches peeps the evening star. Moreover sombre deeds that dye the soul Crimson, dark horrors fleeing from the light, Seem twice as grim when actors play their rôle Beneath the sombre ceiling of the night. All is so real—we watch no more a part That some mere actor, aping passion, plays: We feel the wild love throb through Romeo's heart And Shakespeare's Juliet thrills us as we gaze. I gazed—the strange spell seized me, and I felt While in the background countless lanterns gleamed As if before some sacred shrine I knelt Or in Art's holiest temple gazed and dreamed. Music was rapture—notes that ne'er before Had aught of magic power, creative might, Now struck the airs, each note a tiny oar Urging the soul's bark towards unknown delight. The universe seemed made for love alone; All men were lovers, women all were sweet: Sorrow was but a phase to be outgrown And death a phantom cringing at our feet. II. A VOICE FROM THE SEA The night waxed onward—still the lanterns shone Swung, gently still, by slightly freshening air; Still love was king and pleasure held its own Untired, and still the daring wooed the fair. Still in that magic garden life seemed good And still from young lips rang their silvery glee When I through bosky paths in thoughtful mood Moved slowly forth and sought the silent sea. Not far it was—the garden sheltered lay, A sweet enchanted stormless lamplit spot; Yet hardly a stone's throw forth a waste of grey Stretched, hearing love's soft laugh, but heeding not. No lanterns flashed upon the sombre deep, No throne of pleasure stood exalted there, But stirring as it were in troubled sleep The windless ocean murmured to the air: “I hear the sounds of joyance—through dark leaves Uncounted tiny meteor-lanterns shine; The earth is gladdened, or my ear deceives: Yet what abysmal loneliness is mine! “No stars to-night through all the cloud-draped halls Of heaven shall glitter, nor shall laughter be To-night within the black sky's boundless walls Save only mine, the laughter of the sea.” I heard, and as I heard my spirit thrilled Moved deep within me—from the sea there came A sudden sense of mighty power that filled My spirit with might and joy without a name. No more the scent of heliotrope and pine Suggested love's soft hour and passion's glee; My nostrils drank the scent, the scent divine, That gives to man the strange soul of the sea. And, as I drank the scent, my soul grew great And amorous for the sea's embrace and strong; Then through the starless dark heaven's cloudy gate Came the first cadence of the night-wind's song:— “One fête, O sea! and are not thousands thine, When through the heights and depths of purple space The frenzied spears of forked red lightning shine And when the pale ships shudder at thy face? “One mortal fête, one garden's joyous bowers Wherein swift-hearted lovers urge their claims— Lo! theirs are one night's perishable flowers, Thine are the golden stars' immortal flames. “Fêtes thou hast watched on balmier shores than these Beneath a softer heaven, where gentler night Darkens the myrtle-groves and orange trees And where fair women's eyes flash lovelier light. “Where are the lovers who beside thy waves Exchanged love's vows a thousand years ago? Thy waters wash above their lampless graves: Above their summer haunts thy wild waves flow. “Fêtes thou hast watched on ships that through the deep Urge venturous keels—then changing light to gloom Hast bade the music pause, the dancers sleep No wakeful slumber in their cold vast tomb. “Man is but mortal but, immortal sea, Beyond all words thine heart and mine are strong: Thou hast the music of eternity Within thy silence, I within my song.” Then, as the wind's song ceased, from cloud on cloud The sudden spears of lightning flashed their gleams; The thunder pealed above the plains unploughed; Far in the past seemed passion's languid dreams. For now a larger passion shook my soul Swayed by the prowess of the stormy night: I laughed to hear the rising breakers roll, Watching the echoing coast-line fringed with white. The storm-wind and the sea were holding there Majestic parley, their wild hearts were one:— The lightning's fiery radiance thrilled the air, The midnight blackness that defies the sun. And through it all I mortal was a part Of the immortal—time had ceased to be. The mighty sea's was as the storm-wind's heart: The storm-wind's soul was boisterous with the sea. All was forgotten save the strife I saw, The strife that hurls the doomed ships to their goal: With rapture deeper even than deepest awe I saw revealed the ocean's deathless soul; The soul that though man's race to-day might die Would still hold parley with the storm, the night, And still through limitless eternity Worship the gloom and battle with the light. III. THE DAY AFTER A silent morn—the storm had wholly passed, The sunless ocean rested still and grey; I sought the garden paths, the lawns green-grassed, Where last night's feastful hours had slipped away. Ah! in one night wild autumn's hand had flung The spoil of months upon the sodden ground: The trees where last night's graceful lanterns swung Seemed now in sombre funeral robes enwound. Their leaves that yesterday bore summer's green And made believe that June's sky still was bright Were robbed to-day of all their lustrous sheen, Stained to disastrous russet in a night. Upon the lawns the brown sere leaves were strewn, Mixed with some scattered lanterns' coloured shreds; Bright paper globes that mocked the golden moon Last night lay tattered on wet paths and beds. Among the heliotrope the mandarins In hopeless wild forlorn confusion lay, Blending their gorgeous reds and vivid greens With purple flowers in desolate array. Where last night's graceful Juliet moved divine A few damp planks and boards neglected frowned, And sombre seemed the lawn's dark fringe of pine That last night heard soft amorous laughter sound. Then through my soul there ran a sudden dread, An icy terror—“Can this horror be? Must soon all bright and joyous things be dead? Is nought immortal save the storm and sea? “Is even the sea itself with all its waves Mortal? Hath time who slays each human form The power to dig for oceans monstrous graves, The strength to hush the trumpets of the storm? “Is there one Spirit who gazing from on high Sees planet after planet reach its goal, Who sees each star within the starry sky Enact its part, and every human soul,— “Who then the farce being ended, says to all, To last night's lovers and to moon and sun, ‘The play is over—let the curtain fall! Pass into darkness, for your hour is done’?” KING SOLOMON When at the last the great King's heart grew weary, When pleasure's wild impassioned reign was done, When laughter of bright lips rang dull and dreary, When sadness veiled the stars and veiled the sun, Then with grim Death the great King thus debated: “The end is drawing near, lift up thine eyes,” Said Death; “through all these long years I have waited, But now my patient keen spear claims its prize.” “But, Death, the world is mine, its every season— I am the lord of winter and of spring; If one flower failed to obey me, it were treason.” Then answered Death: “I also am a King. “The flowers of all the flower-filled world obey me; They smile one hour upon thee half in scorn, Yet not for all thy wealth will they gainsay me: I steal the rubies from the brow of morn. “Where is thy last month's concubine? thou hast missed her? The dark-brown eyes, the soft lips' fragrant bloom— With lips more masterful than thine I kissed her, Then built our bridal chamber in the tomb. “Arise. The sun and stars were thine, the glory Of empire measureless as morning's light: Green plains and forests dark and mountains hoary; Rest in the day and rapture in the night. “Thy throne was molten gold, with ivory blended, A work of which no craftsman's heart had dreamed: On the six steps by which thy foot ascended Twelve golden lions, maned with terror, gleamed. “Beside the throne two lions even more massive, Sculptured in silent gold, yet seemed to say, ‘If man's heart trembles while our strength rests passive Earth's soul must shudder when we pant for prey.’ “Sheba's fair queen with costliest presents sought thee; Thy wisdom through the wide earth won renown: Kings did thee homage,—Ophir's gold they brought thee: The golden sun was envious of thy crown. “The moon was envious in her pearly whiteness Of women whose soft whiteness gladdened thee: Through pitchy night, or under noontide's brightness, Thy countless strong ships coursed from sea to sea. “Horses they brought thee from far Egypt's regions, Proud-nostrilled, fiery, many a flawless form; Steeds fit to mount thine horsemen's mustering legions, Maned like the night and footed like the storm. “Thy chariots gathered in each chariot city Flashed back the sunlight from their wheels of gold: Where David's splashed through blood-pools without pity Through flower-strewn streets thy cars of triumph rolled. “Not heaven itself had stars enough to greet thee— Bright India's birds for thee must rob the skies, Spread star-besprinkled plumes, and raise to meet thee Their banners glorious with a thousand eyes. “David's fierce wars and warrior-deeds were over; The light of peace on all the glad land fell: Thine eyes were ever soft eyes of a lover, Though sombre David's eyes took fire from hell. “Thou hadst no need of mad adultery's rapture For thy strong men sent forth through land on land Brought thee, through fair gifts won or kingly capture, Forms by some love-god's passionate genius planned. “The women of all the realm were thine. Didst covet Some girl with hair that mocked the raven's wing? At night her mouth was thine, thy lips might love it, And she might say, ‘I worship thee, O King!’ “At morn, if thou didst weary of her embraces, Let the joy wane with dawning of the light! For thee another of countless sweet girl-faces Rose with the stars, resplendent on the night. “The joy men seek and many a life foregoes it, The pressure of virgin lips by no man won, Was thine a thousand times—the dark night knows it That for thy sake craved respite from the sun. “To thee the God of David seemed austerer Than gentler gods of nations round thy throne: To thee the white-armed Ashtaroth was dearer Than the stern Lord whom Sinai's peaks enthrone. “The women-gods of nations round thy borders To thee were lovelier than Jehovah's form: Upon the hill-sides temples at thine orders Rose to the gods of starlight or the storm. “Thy soul was full of artist-dreams and fancies; Thou ponderedst on the tales thy women told, On Midianitish lore and strange romances Of passionate gods who ruled in kingdoms old. “But now the end has come. Lift up thy glances— Glances that shook the earth and shook the sea. O King, a mightier step than thine advances: Tremble,—as all the world once quailed at thee.” Then Solomon: “O Death with gaze tremendous What lamp shall light me when I leave the sun?” And Death, with voice than thunder more stupendous: “All stars I extinguish, King, save only one.” Then Solomon: “O Death with lance that quivers, What cup shall proffer me my costly wine?” And Death: “O King, within my realm are rivers; The right to lap their black waves shall be thine.” Then Solomon: “O bitter Death, thus leaving The land of plenty, what food shall I take?” And Death: “Thy soul will hunger not, receiving Each day one loaf of memory's bread to break.” Then Solomon: “O Death, what change or raiment Shall I select from all my priceless store?” And Death: “Thou hast robbed the world, the time for payment Approaches—take thy winding-sheet, no more.” Then Solomon: “Of queens whose eyes mocked morning Which shall I choose for mistress of the night?” And Death: “The faithfullest—but with this warning, Find, if thou canst, one woman who was not light.” Then Solomon: “On what couch shall I slumber, I who with many a white-limbed love have lain?” And Death: “Thy loves have been so many in number That surely to sleep single will be gain?” Then Solomon: “And how long shall I tarry Within the darkness that man's spirit fears, The gloom where bodiless souls eat not nor marry Nor drink nor slumber?” Death: “Three thousand years.” Four times the great King's loneliness was broken, Four times a spirit in those three thousand years Hovering approached him, and a word was spoken That rang like thunder in the great King's ears. Four times a spirit he once had loved addressed him; Four times that spirit forsook him as in scorn: Four times a spirit whose arms had once caressed him Left him in darkness, crying, “I love the morn!” The first time thus it happed. He saw swift-sailing On starlike wings through night's perpetual gloom A spirit whose glory and loveliness unfailing Had sweeter been to him than summer's bloom. She on the bridal night with queenly laughter Had said: “Bestow a gift on me, O King— A gift that may recall through all the hereafter, In life's dim winter, passion's peerless spring.” And he: “Ask what thou wilt. The world of flowers Is mine, and the underworld of jewelled gleams. O love, shall blood-bright rubies gem thy bowers? O queen, shall star-bright diamonds haunt thy dreams? “Shall Hiram's vessels bring thee gold unmeasured From Tyre, from Sidon? Shall the purple sea Yield up the noblest pearls its depths have treasured? Shall looms of Edom weave rich robes for thee? “Thou art the fairest of far Moab's daughters. For this thy first kiss what gift shall I bring? Ores from the mountains, amber from the waters? Speak thou, O queen—command thy slave, the King.” And she with eyes of more than mortal splendour, Eyes whose bright glance might lead the sun astray, Smiling had said: “In love's supreme surrender My heart is thine, thy will I must obey; “I am thy slave—thou art my lord, my master,— Thine am I from this moment to my grave; Yet woman am I—my desire is vaster Than starlit night, more hungry than the wave. “To-night take all my beauty—it is fairer, They say in Moab, than the day-dawn bright: A royal crown is mine, win thou the wearer; Win from me all thou canst of strange delight. “Yet grant me this, O King—one thing I covet; In Moabitish blood desire runs high: Thou fondlest my white hand,—thou sayest, ‘I love it!’ Place in that hand the rainbow from the sky.” The great King laughed. “O queen, the rainbow's splendour In that white hand of thine thou yet shalt hold— Its gleaming hues, its changing tints most tender, Its red and green, its lilac and its gold.” Then by his magic spells the great King, knowing Secrets revealed to him on earth alone, Created opals—thus for e'er bestowing The rainbow's charm and glamour on a stone. But now she said: “The opal's charm has vanished; My soul has grown beyond such gauds as these. Listen, thou King to night's deep darkness banished; On earth new sunlight shines on lands and seas. “I am the spirit of Freedom—thou the enslaving Strong King of all the world liest chained and bound. Thou mayest not even see the green grass waving; Thou mayest not hear stern Sparta's trumpet sound. “From Asia once again harsh slavery threatens; The dateless future on a thin thread hangs: Asia's tumultuous vast host hourly greatens, One monstrous serpent with unmeasured fangs. “Three hundred heroes in the pass are posted With keen eyes gazing on the silvery sea, The sea that guards the fair land golden-coasted:— Man's history pauses at Thermopylæ. “Lo! time is poised upon a moment breathless: Of centuries Leonidas is lord. Three hundred deaths shall make three hundred deathless; Ten thousand years are balanced on a sword. “As by a hair all Europe's fate is dangling: ‘Draw back,’ saith darkness to the golden morn— ‘Draw back, give place, while Xerxes' hand is strangling The neck of Freedom, in its iron scorn.’ “Five hundred years have passed since in thy palace, O Solomon, my love I gave to thee: Our rainbow-opals circled passion's chalice; Now Freedom's rainbow-circlet crowns the sea. “I, once a slave to all thy royal caprices, Am now to Freedom only chainless thrall For Freedom's touch enslaving, yet releases; At Freedom's voice the inveterate fetters fall. “Now, while pale Europe shrinks from regal capture, With brave Leonidas I pause to see How fearless death may lead to deathless rapture And time pay tribute to eternity.” She spoke—the King remained alone and weeping, But she flew forth to watch the unequal fight That left three hundred in the dark pass sleeping, Their foreheads crowned with everlasting light. Again five hundred years of darkness, lighted By the faint radiance of that single star, Passed o'er the mighty King in gloom benighted, Closed in by past deeds, as by bolt and bar. Then through the gloom he marked a spirit approaching; Before her feet aside the mist-wreaths fell: Her golden wings upon the dark encroaching Lit up like sudden lamps the vaults of hell. A thousand years ago (she then a maiden Of Ammon, he great Israel's peerless lord) He had said, his kingly heart with passion laden, “Choose what thou wilt—then trust my unfailing sword.” And she, within whose hair the stars mistaking Its blackness for sweet night aspired to rest, Said, “Of all jewels of the earth-gods' wondrous making I love the deep-green emerald far the best. “Yet bring me not the emerald's transient lustre; Plant a vast forest round about our throne, Within whose leafage the sun's rays may muster Legions of emeralds nobler than the stone!” So Solomon with ready heart had ordered For her the dark-haired amorous white-browed queen A palace to be built, by dense woods bordered, Where living emeralds flashed their leafy green. But now to-day she said: “O King, low-lying Within the darkness, helpless in the gloom, Upon the earth the sullen night is dying! A living light has flashed upon the tomb! “A nobler reign than thine is now beginning: A mighty Lord, descended, King, from thee, Shall make an end of lust and wrath and sinning,— By love's voice hush the thunder-throated sea. “Rome's empire now through all the world extending Recalls and yet exceeds thine empire old, But this King's empire, when pale Rome's is ending, Boundless, shall storm the sunset's gates of gold. “Women shall seek him—aye, throughout the eras— But by sweet pureness are his victories won. While past kings' dreams dissolve like mist-chimeras His kingdom shall outstay the flagging sun. “The skies shall hear the last low roll of thunder That wearies on the horizon's pallid verge; Beside the lessening waves man's heart shall wonder At the last effort of the worn-out surge: “The very stars with fragments golden-gleaming May strew the heavens, the night drown out the day, The moon may cease to set the green woods dreaming,— Christ's timeless kingdom cannot pass away. “Within his kingdom clasping all things human In deathless clasp of sympathy divine A fairer throne than thy throne waits for woman, A kinglier love, great Solomon, than thine.” In fifteen hundred years the shadows shifted; More light flashed downward from the single star: His weary brow once more the great King lifted,— He saw a spirit approaching from afar. A queen he recognised whose golden tresses Through the Eastern night shone fairer than the sun In the old lost hours of mirth and love-caresses, A wife in Midian's mountain-regions won. “And art thou come to cheer my lonely slumber, To be once more my light?” the great King said: “I, once the lord of palaces past number, Have now no pillow for thy golden head!” The sweet ghost answered: “Past all power of telling Is the great change within my spirit wrought Since by those Eastern fountains upward welling We wandered, mingling queenly and kingly thought. “O King, my soul has grown beyond thy dreaming; Thine harem's backward blossoms all have blown: The eyes that once were stars upon thee gleaming Are now as suns to lands thou hast not known. “A mighty power beyond the Western waters, England, has risen—a land where all are free. My heart is now as hearts of England's daughters, Full of the passion of the chainless sea. “Work have I now to do—work vast, undying; I may not share with thee thy timeless sleep: I have to watch, on my keen sight relying, A mighty fleet whose sails are on the deep. “Beyond thy dreams of love my soul has risen; I am thy slave, thy love-crowned queen, no more! Rest thou for ever in thy lonely prison; I am as free as waves that kiss the shore. “Lo! from the South a giant fleet approaches; Slaves are they who man it, and a king who sends: On English waters their lewd flag encroaches; On me the Armada's destiny depends. “Fate has bestowed on me the power of hurling Upon the Armada all the ocean's might, Wild winds and thunders and white waters whirling: Woman I was—I am the spirit of night! “Fate's hand has stolen the stars of night for crowning My forehead—starless yet my wreath shall be That Philip's fleet may perish, darkness drowning A godless host in hell-depths of the sea. “That is my work, O King—not now to sunder The self-forged chains that hold thee powerless there But forth to hurl the lightning and the thunder, Queen of the storm and sovereign of the air.” Ere long once more the lonely watch was broken— A spirit approached on dawn-pink pinions borne, Then, ere the great King's doubtful word was spoken, Said: “King, behold in me the spirit of morn! “Dost thou remember me the Hittite maiden Of whose blue eyes thou didst one morning say, ‘The sunlit heights beside them are mist-laden; Twin sovereigns are they of the golden day!’ “Ages have passed—behold! in England rises The mightiest poet whom man's race shall hear,— He who can penetrate all hearts' disguises And make all history's darkest moments clear. “Him have I now to aid, smiting asunder Old shackles, pouring through his song supreme Whereat all time to come shall pause in wonder The force of truth, the sweetness of a dream. “Woman I was—I am the spirit of morning And morning's breath in Shakespeare's song shall be; Strength as of dawn, when rose-flushed peaks give warning, And boundless light as of the shoreless sea. “Not Milcah, Tirzah, Asenath,—no longer Our dark-eyed maidens hold man's spirit bound; Man worships even far sweeter souls and stronger, Souls whom the poet of mankind has crowned. “England to-day takes up the chant of the ages, And through that chant rings woman's rallying cry: Within her heart a blossoming hope assuages Her long despair, her voiceless agony. “Thou in the East didst hold our spirits fettered: Prisoned we were, though golden were the walls! Wast thou for one slave's soft kiss truly bettered, Thou, loveless tyrant of a thousand thralls? “Now in the West our agelong bonds are broken. Was Desdemona modelled from a slave? Could any word by mightiest monarch spoken Curb Portia's spirit,—or control the wave? “The sea's force in the hearts of England's daughters From tyrant-kings for ever sets them free. Thy sceptre swayed the hills, but not the waters: The desert was thy footstool, not the sea. “The sea is Shakespeare's, and his land's, for ever; The sea, the stars, the everlasting sun, The passionate heart of love that wearies never— These all are England's, till all time be done.” Again five hundred years—the star seemed nearer: Its golden portals filled with fiery light Flashed till the dense surrounding gloom grew clearer; A gleam of hope shot radiance through the night. Hope! For three thousand years the King, despairing, In woe profound and darkness' depths had lain: Can hope whose soul is love, whose breath is daring, Light up those lampless soundless deeps again? Then starlike—even as if the star, creating Its fairy spirit of brightness, from afar Had sent her—came on wings unhesitating A spirit whose glance was radiant as a star. Then Solomon remembered, slowly raising The shadowy curtains of three thousand years, A maiden passing forth from love, and gazing One moment back with dark eyes full of tears. She had given the King one month of kingly pleasure, One month,—and then had passed into the gloom: But in that month her soul with all its treasure Had blossomed, all its wealth of scent and bloom. She had loved the King, she just a captive maiden— He ruler of the earth, of sea and land. She gave her soul to him, with sweetness laden: He took the flower,—then dropped it from his hand. But now, though vast strange centuries intervening Had done their varying tasks, then waned and fled, She, apprehending love's eternal meaning, Had sought the King among the living dead. She spirit-ruler of the star whose brightness Had dared to face the midnight's sombre scorn Now, pure as mountain-snow's ethereal whiteness, Came whispering words of sweet hope newly born. “Rise!” said she: “time is nought, and life is vaster Than all the swift-winged ways and moods of time. Not death, but love, is all the ages' master,— Lord even of hell, star-garlanded, sublime. “A thousand hearts have failed thee. Yet, immortal, A mightier love than theirs pulsates through one. Lift up thine eyes. Through morning's golden portal Rolls slowly forth the chariot of the sun.” Then Solomon arose.—The star receded; Its task accomplished, that pale lamp might die: But in the East its lustre was not needed, For love's majestic morning lit the sky. JOHN HENRY NEWMAN AND VICTOR HUGO (John Henry Newman: born Feb. 21st, 1801, died Aug. 11th, 1890. Victor Hugo: born Feb. 26th, 1802, died May 22nd, 1885.) While all men's hearts with new-born hope were fed, Hope in the morning, sweet faith in the sun, Hope that dark tyrannous ages all were dead, That reigns of kings and reigns of priests were done; While all men's eyes beheld the morning light Red in the skies, but blood-red over France,— While all men dreamed that now the starless night Had quailed before the high sun's fiery glance; While all men dreamed that now on Europe's plains Untinged with blood might wave the untrodden rye,— While Revolution's forehead red with stains Confronted unabashed the sunlit sky, Two sunlike spirits arose—on each the doom Of endless love, redemptive of their race: And unto one the sweet morn's light was gloom, And one's eyes looked the strong sun in the face. To one the light of morn was but a dream; His heart was with the ages past and dead: The sunshine seemed a pale deceptive gleam, And Freedom's sword was soiled with ominous red. His hands groped backward through blind ways and strange, Seeking to grasp the Cross; his eyes yearned back: His thoughts that moved within a narrow range Guided his feet along a flowerless track. Born in an age when thought had risen to smite All chains and fetters from the soul of man, Born at the morn, he rested in the night, Turned from thought's sea to where thought's stream began. The stars were more to him—the stars that gleamed Leading wise men along a desert way— Than the great sun whose glory round him beamed; The shadowy night was lovelier than the day. True, noble of heart he was—all men loved well Our English Newman, English to the last. Rome tempted, tempted subtly, and he fell: Yet from his heart the sweet love never passed. Still was there something alway in his soul Of English greatness, still his soul was free: Rome's thunders never wholly hushed the roll Of stormier thunders, thundering from the sea. But on the other's soul the morning gleamed. Born at the century's dawn, for him the night Was as a far-off past whereof some dreamed While he dreamed only of the golden light. For him when Revolution's thunders spoke It was as if a thousand reigns were done,— Man freed for ever from night's fruitless yoke And servant only of morning and the sun. All hopes and joys and passions of the race Were his to sing, were his in soul to share: He saw the sun-bright form of Freedom chase Gaunt Slavery's form to its last sunless lair. He saw man's soul as man's soul is to be; Upon the necks of kings and popes he trod: Man's serfs and thralls in love's name he set free, And broke man's idols in the name of God. Woman he saw, not as she is to-day, Man's slave, man's harlot, with the streets for home, But as she will be when men's hearts obey Love's nobler law, in happier years to come. Lightning of anger flashed along his strain; Through resonant verse the loud song-thunder broke: Yet had he pity for a child's least pain— Through him the very heart of childhood spoke. Pity he had for kings, for all who erred, For tyrants, for the ravening souls that slew; Aye, tenderest pity for even each captive bird That pines for deep green woods and skies of blue. The eternal love to him was God supreme; The love that dwells behind the sombre skies, In woman's heart, in woman's passionate dream,— The God whose sunlight shines in sinless eyes. When loudest fell the cataracts of the waves And thunder pealed from heaven's exalted dome Fearless he faced the stormy God who paves His floors with shipwreck and his path with foam. Nature was his—the solemn starlit night; The winds that range the echoing hills for prey; Sunrise upon the waters golden-bright; The rose whose beauty triumphs for a day. And love was his to sing—fair beauty's rose Triumphant through wild hours of centuries long: While through the heart of man love's strange thrill goes The heart of man shall love the poet's song. While on the earth green grows the tender grass Each amorous springtide, while on flower and tree Love scatters jewels as the seasons pass, While love's eyes steal their sapphire from the sea; While on the mountains the eternal snows Gleam white as on the world's first birthday morn, While first love's kiss is fragrant as the rose, While passion laughs the thought of death to scorn; While other Esmeraldas still arise With summer's flower-sweet darkness in their hair, While once more Doña Sol's imperious eyes Bid pale Hernani worship—and despair; While beauty still is unto man the chief Of all things, sweeter than the dream of power, Shaming with deathless hues the thorns of grief, The tints that blush and perish in the flower; While woman's beauty still is crown of Art, The one thing worshipful, the one thing pure, All loveliness that wrought on Hugo's heart In Hugo's song shall blossom and endure. Another century dawns,—the thought of each Therein beyond all doubt shall have its day: To some the churchman's cloistered life shall preach, And some the poet's stormier heart shall sway. Some who love best the sunlight filtering through Stained glass shall seek with Newman shadowy fanes, And some with Hugo's spirit shall seek the blue Bright sun-kissed sea's illimitable plains. Aye, some shall dream with Hugo on the waves And seek with him the sunlit road to God, And some with Newman, seeking starlit graves, Shall tread the thorn-strewn paths that dead saints trod. Some souls shall worship where the wild wind reaps Its fruitless harvest from the fields of foam, And some where time is chained and progress sleeps Within the walls of immemorial Rome. Some souls shall deem, deep-moved by Newman's thought, The ardent passion of his eager brain, That England—sea-zoned England—can be brought Beneath the yoke of haughty Rome again. And some, whose hearts the great French poet stirs, Shall dream that Paris in the end shall be The wide world's centre—all man's worship hers, And hers the wealth of many a far-searched sea; That in the end when all men's minds are one And all men's hearts love's uninvaded home Love's reign, already in his heart begun, Shall be complete in Paris, not in Rome. Some hearts shall dream with Newman that the ghost Of love, the ghost the Roman Church allows, Is fittest bride for man aspiring most, Man's purest helpmate, most seductive spouse; Deeming that human love must ever err When passion through it throbs with mighty force,— Not seeing woman, but the shadow of her,— Deeming love's rapture senseless half, half coarse; Holding that ever far beyond the skies Must love accomplish its diviner dream, And that the light that flashes from the eyes Of woman draws from hell its magic gleam. Others will hold with Hugo that the light Of woman's eyes in far-off heaven was born; That till it shone, no starshine lit the night; That her hand fills with flowers man's wreath of thorn; That woman's beauty is the gift supreme, Man's holiest rapture, his divinest bliss; That heaven with all its joys was but a dream Till heaven met earth in passion's fiery kiss. SONG [Some love endures a season] Some love endures a season; It blossoms as the rose: It blooms without a reason, Without a thought it goes. It comes through dreamland's portal; It flashes on our eyes; It makes some song immortal, Then in an hour it dies. Such love, though brief and hollow, Wins worship as of old: A thousand lovers follow The form they may not hold. “The fairest love is fleetest And soonest lost in gloom; Love's dawn,” they say, “is sweetest When sunset brings its doom.” If pleasure's white hand beckons, What eager hearts pursue! The pain, the cost, who reckons? Who asks if love be true? That love is sweet is certain, The noontide sun is bright— Why lift the future's curtain? Why peer into the night? Yet with immortal passion, Though not in all men's ears, A love of nobler fashion Sings—as to one that hears. To live,—if life be needed; To die,—if she may gain; For this my heart hath pleaded: Will passion's prayer be vain? A LOST MOTHER 1892 IN MOST LOVING MEMORY OF MY MOTHER FRANCES CHARLOTTE BARLOW [This time last year, mother, thou wast with me—] This time last year, mother, thou wast with me— The flowers still bloomed, the world was full of light: The sun still flamed at morn, o'er land and sea; The stars still ruled the empire of the night. To-day thou art gone, and all is changed indeed! For me the whole dim world in shadow lies. Not from the sun, the stars, doth light proceed, But from the love that fills a mother's eyes. Yet, though the light die out on hill and plain, Though darkness spread its veil across the deep, Though I shall never meet on earth again Thine eyes, closed in their everlasting sleep,— Though thou art gone from thine accustomed place, Though sorrow do its deadly best to kill, God, who divides, can bring us face to face, The Power that wrought our love is with us still. September, 1892. A LOST MOTHER I. From immemorial time thou hast been here With each sweet new-born year:— Must this year's hours Keep lonely watch with me for bloomless flowers? From immemorial time thou hast been mine, Love's gift, love's tenderest sign:— Now must I see The unpitying darkness shroud love's form and thee? O mother! mother! So the breezes cry,— The listening waves reply; What, art thou dead! Does no strong help stoop downward from on high? O mother! mother! So the forests moan And heavenly heights, star-sown: Thou art dead! thou art dead! And I am left in all the world alone. From babyhood to childhood, and from this To manhood, thy grave kiss Shielded,—Dead! Dead! What hath become of thy revered grey head? Thou hast closed the door,—thou wilt again appear With the new green-robed year: Thou art not dead,— 'Twas but a dream, one moment of wild fear. Thou hast closed the door,—thou wilt again return? This madness we shall spurn. Thou art not dead: Thou wilt walk with me through the flowers and fern? Thou art asleep,—thou wilt again awake, Mother, for thy son's sake? Thou art not dead,— Dead! O my God,—and will my heart not break? Thou art just sleeping for a little while And then thou'lt wake and smile! Living, not dead, Thou wilt arise from that cold white still bed. What, never more awake? Thine eyes no more Watch the new daylight pour In at the window-pane,— Thine ears hear no sea-music on the shore? Never? I'll not believe it! 'Tis not so: Thou canst not wholly go; Nay, thou wilt come again, And with the same eyes watch the green buds grow. And yet, where art thou? Oh, the spring comes back: It is not green, but black! And summer brings no flowers Now, to pour round her on the sunny track. Yea, all things change for me; the morn will long Be dim with sense of wrong, The starlit hours Most dumb, most dark, that once were light and song. Thou hast been with me these glad many years, Mother,—Oh grant that I, Since thou art dead, may die! Love pleads for death: 'tis life alas! who hears. II. Surely I needed thee the most of all,— Thy heart on which to call. And now thou art dead,—thou art dead,— On me most weak this heaviest blow must fall. There could not be beneath the blue calm sky One mother-needing spirit such as I,— And yet thou art dead, Thou turn'st not back for groan or prayer or cry. I needed thee,—and yet a million more Are motherless as well: Vast is pain's iron hell; Millions have watched at death's relentless door. And now I join the army robed in grief Whom from afar I've seen: What sorrow's depth may mean They tell me,—none can point me to relief. III. And must I live my life, and rise and sleep? Work,—since I cannot weep? Must daily toil begin, A joyless strife renewed, with nought to win? Has life a value, mother, now for me Lonely, apart from thee? From dawn to set of sun Never was work without thy counsel done! How shall I strive, alone, To lure the coy Fame downward from her throne? If Fame should stoop at last Would not the soul's exultant power be past? IV. No friends around can know, Mother, dead mother, that I loved thee so! I am not one to speak Or ease my heart by passionate overflow. They are kind,—but have they heard With me for many a spring the spring's first bird, Seen gulf and creek Flash with a thousand gems at summer's word? Have they, when exiled summer dies of pain, Watched autumn's glittering reign, And, labouring even as one, Through sunless winters sighed not for the sun? Have flowers and ferns and shells in many lands Gathered by earnest hands Taught loveliest lessons?—Now must all be o'er, Delight of groves and shore? V. O beautiful blue sky, thou gleamest on, Though she, my light, is gone! And ye too have no hearts to sympathize, Ye placid starlit skies! Great careless fragrant rose Blooming and shining in the garden-close, How canst thou do this thing? Art thou still crowned, when crownless pain is king? How the world followeth still Its weary selfish ceaseless restless will! She has passed away: and what Is that to world,—or star or lake or hill? Cold nature cannot mourn. We tell our woes To cowslip or to rose: They heed us not: No sorrow breaks the griefless deep's repose. Little it is to wave or star indeed; These fail us at our need: But if on heights divine Listening my mother's soul be touched of mine Most deeply sorrowing, will she not come down, Casting aside her crown? Will she not yearn to help me where I wait, Eyeing the close-shut gate? Shall she not answer prayer Who hath answered even a thought, a wordless fear? Through night's soft darkness shall she not draw near? Ah!—black void endless air! VI. In far-off years, a child, I used to pray That death the self-same day Might fall upon us both, my mother and me; God, hast thou answered,—see! Here am I in my power of manhood,—strong, Alas!—I may live long:— I may live years and years and years alone, A suppliant at death's throne. Shall I live years and years, and never see, Mother, the face of thee? See death call shuddering nations forth to die, Yet, doing so, pass me by? Shall I see day give place to starlit night, Yet miss my one star's light? Miss, when spring's cowslips load with scent the breeze, One flower more sweet than these? VII. If I could see thee!—know Just once for certain that thou waitest me, The dreariest pang would go: But this is just the gift which cannot be. Most hard it seems to bear, Most hard,—that, if the dead be living yet, Our foreheads may be met Never by breathings from their mountain-air. O mother—just to know That Death's forlorn black “Never” is a lie! Then could I wait to die; Will no Power speak the word I long for so? I gaze into the void Of silent sea and starlit deep-blue air, By the heart's madness buoyed:— It is in vain; thou art not there. VIII. I did not see thee waxing day by day Older,—how could I see? Thou wast the same to me As flower or moon or sun or starry ray. Though thou wast growing grey, I noticed not,—thou wast there every morn: Fair credulous love hath only sweetest scorn For death, and dreams no dream can pass away. IX. That thou shouldst be my mother hour by hour, Changeless, of sovereign power, That all of thine should last Though aging worlds drew deathward, darkening fast, This seemed past question: yea, that when the morn O'er golden hills was borne,— That when at drowsy noon The glad earth slept, with eyelids touched by June,— That when from budding copse or white-flowered tree Rang forth the throstle's glee,— That when the blue waves bore Tribute of rainbow shells to rock or shore,— That when the boats black-hulled and russet-sailed Gleamed, till the light wind failed,— That when the bright star-rebels, one by one Glittering, deposed the sun,— That then thou shouldst be with me seemed so right That never, save at night Sometimes, when flashes of the future came Across me like a flame, Could I conceive that one day all these things Would go on as before, But thou wouldst never mark the throstle's wings Nor watch the white-edged shore. X. Herein the agony lies, The dark strange torment past man's power to bear,— That thou art wrapped in dim funereal air Unpierced of mortal eyes; That never—never again—this much is sure— Can I behold thy face Until I pass the gateway of the place Sunless, unknown, obscure. E'en yesterday—it seems—to find thy room I had but to cross one street: To-day...before we meet I too must pass the gateway of the tomb. XI. I saw thy face in death; Calm, lovely, almost girlish, so it seemed— Lying like one that dreamed A dream so sweet the dreamer held her breath. Yet, mother, unto me Thy lined sweet aged face was sweeter far: Whatever angels are, My need is not of angels, but of thee. XII. We held the gates in force,—but in the night When on our baleful town The murderous fog sank down, When moon nor star gave sweet and helpful light, Then, through one postern-gate The silent Shadow crept; It slew her while she slept; We seized our weapons...Ah, too late! too late! XIII. For years beyond man's dream That viewless host of death has held its own: With trumpet-sound, or with no bugle blown, No warning lance-point's gleam, That dim veiled host has crept from town to town Changing man's mirth to sighs— Snatching from monarch's brow the lordliest crown, Closing the fairest eyes. And yet to those who weep The shock seems ever new and ever strange: Though all the world might change, The form they loved they thought their love could keep. XIV. Could we have known that death was near How many things our lips would then have said, Winning sweet answer from the lips now dead, Things sweet to say and hear! What loving farewell then upon the verge Of this the change supreme, Within full sight, full hearing of the surge Of that strange sea that flashed with distant gleam! What thoughts to tarry with us night and day Then through the coming years, Thoughts that might wipe away Some well-nigh hopeless tears! Ah! so we dream. In this the answer lies Perhaps to our despair— That love is changeless, whether past the skies Or breathing here our earthly air: That where most perfect love Has been, no farewell formal and forlorn Could aid, or serve to move From the pierced brow one point of thorn. The last “Good-night”—not known to be the last— This, it may be, far more availed Than any summing up of all the past Or kiss, while life's strength slowly failed. XV. O Death that sparest not the tiniest flower, The smallest sea-weed in the whole wide sea, Wilt thou spare me,— Wilt thou not give me my victorious hour? Thou takest to thyself all summer bloom; Along the violet-scented vales thy hand Sweeps, and behold the land Is as a tomb! No timid prayers, no blossom-pleas, delay Thine hosts upon their way: Thou steal'st the rose,— Then at thy touch September's glory goes. Dead golden Junes are glad within thy halls, And thy voice calls In the end all weary singers unto thee: Forget not me. Thou showedst Keats within thy starlit bowers Fairer than earthly flowers, And her my mother thou didst gently take,— Me thou wilt not forsake? When thou dost light within thy sombre sky Lamps lovelier far than ours that wane and die, For me reserve thou one; Then lead thou back the mother to the son. XVI. He who redeems from death Is with the unerring mighty death-force one; There are not two vast Powers beneath the sun; One God bestows, the same God stays, the breath. One God, and only One, In flower-filled Galilee By the clear inland sea Spake through blue waves, bright blossoms, to his Son; Then, at the bitter end, Built up with iron hands the cross that slew, Aye held the spear that smote his Son's side through;— Death, life, are one same Friend. So, mother, unto thee and me It may be God first spake At crimson sweet daybreak, Even as the Giver of long glad days to be: Then 'neath the noontide sun Spake still,—spake as the One Who brought unto our door Of rich pure blessings so divine a store: Then lastly, it may be, When came the sunset, then the dim night's close (Oh night—that night!), God as sweet Death arose, Thy Steersman still—to shores we may not see. XVII. Though swathed in mists and storm That Steersman's shape, that Steersman's face, may be, Yet may we sometimes see Erect, unmoved, the Watcher's form. Though starlight fails us, though the wild ship goes Through lampless wastes where never sun arose, Yet, mother, “Hitherto”—so thou didst say— “The Lord hath helped us on our way.” I take the inspiring word, On thy lips lately heard: “Through starless nights, through days of strife and storm, May he who guided two, guide still one form!” XVIII. Aye, even in disease When fail the heart and brain, When fails still more the soul of him who sees, Yet cannot lull, the maddening pain— Then, even then, the Lord Within the strange unknown disease may lurk, Watching his atom-armies at their work, Giving each germ its keen small sword:— That so this bodily frame Assaulted, stormed, or undermined at last, May fade by natural laws into the past, Given back to earth, or given to flame; That then, the fleshly scaffolding removed, The soul's fair palace, finished quite, may gleam, Lovelier than palace of the loveliest dream, Lovelier than all we loved. XIX. When face to face I stood With the dim form by death already veiled, When heart and spirit quailed Already at life's o'ershadowing solitude,— Then—though in days gone by It needed not a cry To bring sweet answer from the lips divine That were alive, and mine— Then—though the slightest plea Brought answer back to me Once—then my soul's most hopeless moan Wrung forth no answer from thy lips of stone. XX. This saddens me—that never more On whatsoever golden shore We twain may meet, will mother and son Be made through weakness even more fully one. It breaks my heart to think, Mother, my one best friend, That I no more may lend My aid to thee on the dark river's brink. So sweet it is—the weakness of old age! So sweet thy gentle face,— And in it one might trace The lessons of long life, pure page by page. Thou needest me no more! Thou needest not my arm on which to lean— Oh God, no angel-form, no heavenly scene, No palace flashing gems from roof to floor, Only my mother's figure, slightly bent, Herself, not able to walk far, This I desire!—no stately angel sent From deathless sun or star. XXI. Yea, now the sudden change! Now am I, as it were, once more a child: Thou from the heights to me most strange Canst stoop to aid me, weary and sin-defiled. Thou art renewed, reborn; Now thou hast passed the dark sad hour Thou hast the sunlit brow, the deathless power: 'Tis I who am weak,—and utterly forlorn. XXII. And if in one swift flash I understand, Mother, the heart of thee, Thou too mayest know more fully me Than when we walked here, hand in hand. Thou now dost see more fully—is it so?— That I was seeking God, through darkling ways; That I was compassed round by fiend and foe And fought 'mid gloom and haze. Is death's hand, after all, the only hand That leads two spirits towards one haven at last? Is death even as the watcher at the mast Whose voice rings through the silence, crying “Land!” XXIII. They “sealed” the sepulchre and “made it sure,” “Setting a watch”—but yet... Can God's light traverse even the ways obscure Where death's and horror's ice-cold hands have met? Us the foul horror chills: O God of sunlight, canst thou pierce the gloom? The tomb of Jesus was an empty tomb; My mother's?...Empty also, if God wills. XXIV. In the cold early morn The ringing at the bell,—the message sent! Through the dark streets I went, Encountering full death's glance of scorn. O silent streets, O night That ended as the light So dim, so cheerless, so heart-broken, came, Were ye the very same, The same streets, and the night Through which a few short hours before I passed, while all around seemed bright? Even so the ship is doomed when nearest shore. XXV. God to this agony brought me—did he plan In far-off days the mode to bear me through? Is not one point unknown to him and new, Though strange to suffering man? Can he who sees the whole Bear through the darkness threatening from afar, Even as a small but unextinguished star, The vessel of my soul? XXVI. And if the sorrow of one Be thus discounted, thus foreseen and known, Can God in every case not hold his own And cope with every grief beneath the sun? Not only with our grief, But with the sorrow in each most distant star,— If in those golden orbs there are Souls clamorous for relief? Is all foreseen—this universe of ours, Is it held safe within the Father's hand? Is all foreknown and planned,— Our human deaths, and even the deaths of flowers? Is there no pang too much? No grief that cannot in the far-off end By Love's transmuting touch Be changed to joy, a foe become a friend? Shall I be told, when pain is past, By thine own lips, O mother, it may be, Why thou wast taken thus from me? Will death the conqueror be dethroned at last? XXVII. How huge is man's long-historied grief! Aye, even in days ere history was begun Death stabbed some mother, and her son Mourning as I mourn, found as small relief. In some vague land forgotten of light, Buried beneath the weight of endless years, The same cry pierced the night— “Mother!” Who heard? Who hears? XXVIII. To be made wholly one With all the world in fellowship of grief May count for something. Human joy is brief, And sorrow stalks between us and the sun. I told my story of pain to one I met; He gentler seemed, to grief more reconciled. He said: “A grey-haired mother you regret; I sorrow for a child.” XXIX. So many have gone before! Surely thou art not lonely, mother, there. Strong souls are ready, faces sweet and fair, To welcome thee upon the further shore. 'Tis I who am left alone! Thou feel'st the grasp of many a loving hand: Thy brothers by thee stand; My father claims thee, long-lost, for his own. But oh! forget not me Left on this dreary earth,—prepare a place Where I again may see thy face, Mother, and dwell with thee. XXX. The years between seem nought: Across the years towards boyhood now I go; Again the blue waves flow Of seas that shine in thought. My life's steps I retrace: For four and forty years thou hast been with me— It seems, now God has taken thee But one brief moment's space. Thy day of death (O day of mist and tears!) Looms from behind interminable years: The day we gathered those white starlike flowers Seems distant only a few short hours! XXXI. If thou couldst wake as if from trance Saying, “I have slept—I feel much stronger now;” If I could meet again thy glance And see morn's sunlight kiss thy brow: If thou couldst say, “I journeyed to the tomb But now again God gives me back to thee, Back to the flowers (how sweet their bloom!) Back to our sky and sea:” Why, then I might perhaps forget, If thou wert thus restored, These hours of agony—and own my debt Then to the pitying Lord. XXXII. Oh! why should only Lazarus return, Quitting the clay-cold grave, the narrow bed? So many souls lament, and wild hearts burn— God, give us back our dead! Why choose—it seems unjustly—only one? Why blunt but once Death's eddying sword? Why hear a sister's prayers, yet not a son— What of my mother, Lord? XXXIII. When the soul longs to weep Then to feel turned to stone, This is indeed an agony most deep— Deadlier than pain of tears or passionate moan. Some sob themselves to sleep— Sleep soothes the pent-up agony within, Comfort and aid they win: Weep thou, O God, for those who cannot weep! XXXIV. Through this last strange sad year Beside the graveyard gate I seem to have stood, there watching bier on bier, Myself most desolate. I have seen a beauty radiant as the morn, A young girl's bloom, Into that starless blackness borne We, shuddering, call the tomb: I have seen a mother's love depart— Having struck once, O Lord, Not in its sheath, but in my heart, Thou hast sheathed thy dripping sword! XXXV. “The singer feels not, in that thus he sings,” You say?—Nay, if he sang not, pain would kill. He takes the help God brings Who bids him even in hell's depths sing on still. “The singer feels not”—Nay, so much he feels That, if he sang not, every day In blank despair would creep away And self-destruction lurk at darkness' heels. XXXVI. When all is done that can be done And all that can be said is said, Time leaves alone the mother with the son— The son alive, the mother dead. That is the torture. Through the day and night The vision still is there; The face so calm, but oh! so white— The silent lips, the silver hair. The night before she kissed me, and the kiss Just like another came and passed: O God how different, had we known that this— This—was the very last! XXXVII. The sorrow is spread across a wider space When brothers, sisters, mourn one common loss. But she and I stood face to face: I bear alone my cross. A widow she, and I an only son— That made communion sweet. Our lives were closely linked, as few or none Have had the gladness—and the grief—to meet. No separation marred our joy; The mother had become the perfect friend: The man drew even nearer than the boy, Aye, ever nearer, till the very end. XXXVIII. Her mind was ripening till the very last, Alive to all the news that each day brings; Before her earth's wild pageant passed,— Its crowned Republics and its throneless kings. When battle's trumpet rang out shrill Her eyes with passionate interest watched the fray, And every stormy question of the day Drew close attention still. Mingled with holier lore She loved the legends of old Greece and Rome, And crossed in thought the dim sea's foam, Landing on many a far-off shore. The conversation ready and bright So keenly I miss—the well-stored brain; The mind's unintermittent light, Quenchless by age or pain; The thought wherein confusion never crept, Not weakness even—to the last hour clear; The thought that from the first hour kept Pace with my own thought here; This, not the loving heart alone, I miss, and shall till life is o'er: The soul that made one music with my own,— Music that sounds no more. XXXIX. What are all crowns of fame— If any wreath, though my desert be small, Should in the end to love and labour fall— What are they worth,—what is a poet's name? For years I toiled to win The laurel crown—it seemed the one thing worth Eternal effort on the ephemeral earth: Such effort seems to-day almost a sin. This was the one thing worth Far more than all the highest success on earth— To lay my tired pen down, To cease from dreaming of the bay-leaf crown, To seek my mother's room And there, though on the city darkness lay, To meet the glad smile lovelier than the day, Sunlike in London's deepest gloom. XL. And yet I think that she would say to me, “Cease not from effort—rather struggle on! Thou shalt not work alone: Thy father and I will toil along with thee. “Win thou the flower of fame; Its odour shall be sweet Even here,—yea, labour nobly till we meet: Thou labourest for our name.” XLI. The golden crocus blows again, But oh so different seems its brightness now! I see it through a mist of pain: The leaves seem altered on each budding bough. Yea, all things take their colour from our thought: The radiant waves Will flash their countless gems for nought On eyes that dream of graves. So must it ever be. I saw the flowers, the summer skies, The splendour of the sea, Not through my own, but through my mother's eyes. XLII. The sorrow of one appeals to all. A song of deepest pain In men's hearts may remain When loveliest strains of pleasure's music pall. No song of flower or sea, No song of morning on the sun-kissed hills, No song that takes its cadence from the rills, Hath in it grief's forlorn eternity. No Venus hath the power, Though white and sweet and fair of limb she be And full of glory of her mother-sea And her soft mouth in flower, Yet hath she not the power to lure mankind For all her deathless charms As grief can lure,—and as grief's song can bind, Not with white hands but with gaunt iron arms. XLIII. Had we but closelier watched that day, Had we but guessed that then the attack was planned, Could we, a small but fully awakened band, Have held the hosts of death at bay? Could we have kept death at the door And given, if but for one sweet summer more, Life and the joy of life to one Gladdened so simply by fresh air and sun? I think we might have,—who can say? But does not that most piteous “might” In its mute force convey A sense of horror deeper than the night? Yea, deadlier, deeper, than the tomb That shrouds my mother's form from mortal eyes Is the persistent gloom That on her son's soul lies; On his,—and on another watcher's soul. Two feel that, had their task been fully done, Two broken hearts might even to-day be whole: God help the watcher,—and the son! XLIV. And yet I seem to hear the dead sweet voice Saying, “Blame not overmuch yourselves, my son: God watched—no evil is done; Be thou not sad,—rejoice! “Even if the door of life was left ajar Not through that door came death alone, Nay, Love came with him,—Love who can atone For all mistakes and sins in every star.” XLV. Somewhat no doubt at every death is felt Of self-reproach—the watchers deem they slept Or watched not keenly, when the blow was dealt, When from its scabbard death's sword leapt. God help us—though we love, we are but frail: When we would watch, we sleep. May God the unsleeping Watcher keep O'er all the loving watch that cannot fail! XLVI. If now my father claims thee, is it well? If well for him, is it then ill for me? —Nay, surely golden flower and purple sea And emerald hill-side have their tale to tell? If now in heaven more dazzling flowers Await her gaze, yet many a lovely sight On this old earth was ours: Fair sunlit morns, and many a moonlit night. XLVII. Through work now lies the road, Through work and daily duties, back to thee:— As with clear gentle voice thou biddest me Stoop and lift up my load; The burden of daily labour to be done, The burden of lonely thought— Somewhat is waiting, ever, to be wrought By patient toil, some summit to be won. Not through the graveyard, through the gate of life Lies the road back to thee: Through earnest labour, noble strife, Working out ends my tired eyes cannot see. XLVIII. We dream of angel-forms; Heaven is to us some wondrous land afar, Lighted by rays of many a distant star, Remote, untroubled by our dark-winged storms. Aye, so we dream—the truth we little heed. The angel-voice spake clear; The heaven we sought was here; We see it now, too late,—too late indeed! XLIX. The storms, the troubles, brought the angelic aid: Our land of rain and sun Must sweeter be than one All shadow, or devoid of any shade. The daily help, mother, the daily smile, These were thine angel-tributes unto me; Time then was lovelier than eternity— Alas! but for awhile. L. Yet cannot he whose power first wrought the dream Prolong it—aye for ever, if he wills? He who upon earth's emerald hills Set sunlight, on the sea its sapphire gleam; He who bright day by day, glad hour by hour, Hath helped us, filling every spring the land With laughter of a thousand fields in flower That flashed with countless gold beneath his hand; Can he not, though our hearts despond, Elsewhere with nobler tints adorn the year? The love that drew so fair a picture here Has failed not ever. Can it fail beyond? LI. We say: “The dead know not; If they were with us, they could help to-day, Share this dark grief, or bear this pain away— If they could know, less sunless were our lot! “Again, if they could share our thought Some thoughts of ours might bring delight, Some rays from earthly stars might pierce their night; We should not either weep or smile for nought. “Gladness (if such remain For us) would be more glad And sadness shared would be some shades less sad; Less painful would be pain.” Ah, they may not be far! Our gladness may be theirs to-day; Our sorrows they may bear away: They gaze not down from some cold callous star. They, though their life be lovelier far than ours, Subject to higher laws, May daily and nightly pause To lay beside us fair memorial flowers. The wreaths we weeping brought, The white pure sad funereal bloom We left beside them in the tomb, May be restored—in ways beyond our thought. Our life more fully, it may be, they can share Than we their life to-day; We gaze through skies of sullen grey, They gaze through cloudless air. Far more of us they know Than we of them at this strange hour: Death may bestow on love undreamed-of power, Bursting the senses' prison-gates at a blow. LII. We were so well content, So all-sufficient each to each, So glad beyond all speech: How could we dream the clear skies would be rent? How could we dream that from bright summer skies This thunder-bolt would fall? We never watched at all For death—we only watched each other's eyes. When the green meadows bask beneath the sun In summer, is there one Who, seeing a tiny cloud, would hold his breath Dreaming of death? LIII. If we would value love aright, Must love be taken away? Can no man truly love the day Save only for the contrast of the night? O mother, was it just? Did I not feel the blessing of thine hand Upon my brow? Can I not understand, Save when that hand is turning into dust? LIV. If so the lesson must be learned, If love be taken from the earth That we may know love's utmost worth, Will there be scope to use the knowledge earned? Will there be given me power to show, Mother, that while thou wast with me I failed to grasp the God in thee, Knowing not what now I know? LV. This is a helpful thought— That something wondrous waits Behind the cloud-girt mystic gates Of death,—a something each day nearer brought. “Look forward,” thou didst say, “To meeting those we love.” Ah! through the strife, The toil, the cares, of every day, Mother, the great hope shines, and hallows life. LVI. Still, as each year the lilies blow And gardens grow Divine with fragrance, as each year the sea In centuries yet to be With royal smile puts on anew Its radiant robes of sunlit blue, Through all the glory of Nature men will cry, “Why must our loved ones die?” LVII. And will the wild cry then As now ring through the unanswering air? Will no God mingle with the sons of men? Will still the eternal silence mock man's prayer? Or do the night's wings bear Answer, as only each one knows? Can God who sends the sorrow, send repose? Can God send hope, who sent despair? LVIII. I deemed I was alone, But now from every side I hear the sound Of weeping—mourners gather round: My grief is linked with endless griefs unknown My sorrow is part of these. O God, amid the darkness round thy throne We fall upon our knees: Hear thou the prayer,—hear thou the wordless moan! LIX. Such fierce shocks pave the way For our departure. All seems different now: On sunlit mountain-height and leafy bough Death sets his seal to-day. In even the slightest things we mark a change: The value of all things alters here; Far more familiar grows the sphere That seemed remote and strange. Life's roots are loosened by successive shocks:— Even so the pine that braves the stormiest blast, That lightning rends not from the rocks, Falls to a puff of summer wind at last. LX. The ice-cold horror of the tomb, This haunts my heart by night, by day; It never passes quite away; 'Mid sunlit thoughts the under-thought is gloom. Behind the flowers that light the garden bed, Among the stars, within the blue waves' sheen, I see the grim gaunt faces of the dead, The countless graves at Kensal Green. LXI. One most of all I see. Forgive me, mother, if in my despair Even though thou art not there I seek the spot that saw the last of thee. I know not what thou mayest be now: I only know (And with the extreme deep bitterness of woe) That eyes and hands and the belovéd brow, That all I held so dear, At this point vanished. Could my thoughts forsake At once the spot, even though an angel spake Saying, “She is not here!” LXII. The old doubts confront the soul To-day that man has had to face In every age, in every place: We, knowing a part, still yearn to know the whole. Sometimes a mother dies: For her the eternal rest is won While still youth's bright glad sun Gleams through her daughter's eyes. In heaven how shall it be? The daughter lives on year by year: The end seems not more near; Life's river finds not yet the shoreless sea. The varying days go by: Some hours are glad with sunniest light, Some dark with deepest night; Glad, dark, the countless hours are born and die. But still the mother waits— The daughter's hair grows grey; No light yet flashes from the solemn gates Through which the mother's form was borne away. Where shall they meet and how? The daughter now Is altered, worn and old: The hair the mother stroked was sunniest gold. How will the mother recognise The changed dim eyes? For time has stolen the light, the glow, That filled them long ago! How shall I, mother, being a son, If thou art quite transformed to youth again, Endorse the work by heavenly magic done,— Save only with unutterable pain? LXIII. If there be answer, then this thought Must shape the answer—that the forms we see, By whatsoever hand those forms be wrought, Are wrought for time, not for eternity. They change, they are fugitive: But the sweet love that from a mother's eyes Shines, this shall surely live; Aye live for ever, though its framework dies. Time, change,—these count for nought: The soul outlives the ever-shifting years, By slow steps towards its victory brought Through days of triumph, nights of bitter tears. The thought the forms expressed, This lives for ever. When all stars wax old Still will the mother see the hair of gold Her hand in ages past caressed. So, mother, though love's earlier phase be o'er, Though here thy task is done, Thou art my mother evermore, I, evermore, thy son. LXIV. If day by day I love the dead With deeper passion, holier power, May not they likewise feel from hour to hour Not love's extinction—love's new birth instead? If I love them the more, May not they too—if this high gift may be— Love on, and even purelier than before? May not they also feel more love for me? LXV. Something it is to know that in the gloom A love most sweet abides; That, when I seek the tomb, I then shall grasp at once a hand that guides: That strong and tender aid Waits in advance. Then, though death's surges swell, Where thou art, mother, surely it will be well For me to follow, unafraid. LXVI. Straight from the loves and flowers of sweet midday My soul has passed. No afternoon Has intervened, my thought to attune; With no slow steps the hours have stolen away. Straight from the sunlit morn To this most sombre evening-hour I have been led by some swift Power:— Is it love that leads, or Fate's resistless scorn? LXVII. As one was doomed to bear The pang of parting, maybe it was well, Mother, that on thy son the burden fell; Thou wouldst have had no strength to face despair. Thou in that other world mayest see So many things that lighten pain: But here I bear—I bear for thee— The unalloyed deep grief that would have slain. LXVIII. I have crossed Song's threshold now so many a time And alway, mother, thou hast been with me To help my wayward rhyme; To-day I write not with, but only of, thee. I have written of joy, of passion's rose in bloom, Of sea-waves, of the light— But now of sadness and of grief I write, Of darkness and the tomb. LXIX. Yet in this song, the saddest by far Of all my songs, wilt thou not help me still? Gift me with nobler notes, a purer will— Shine through the gloom, mine everlasting star! Wilt thou not aid mine heart to make This last sad task divine Even though it break? Like all the rest, let this song too be thine! LXX. Sometimes, when first I wake, My heart, forgetting all, forgets to ache: Then comes remembrance with its poisoned fang And its most sharp-edged pang. So may a prisoner in dim vault entombed, At earliest daylight doomed, When first he wakes for one wild moment see Youth's meadows,—not the gallows-tree. LXXI. As later on, he gazes down and meets Eyes that betoken heedless hearts, And through his soul an added horror darts As laughter sounds from the tumultuous streets,— So with mute horror as I gaze A host of mocking forms I seem to see: They jeer and point at me, And laughter rings up from the crowded ways. LXXII. So much I miss Amid the strife and turmoil of the fray The mother's good-night kiss, That closed with blessing many a stormy day. However far away For hours my wandering feet might roam At night they found, and sweeter for delay, The haven of home. LXXIII. “The dead repose,” you say? “The lines on brow and cheek are smoothed away”— But then those lines meant life, For this means strife. They meant the growing in love, the growing in grace, They engraved life's history on the face: Remove them—let them fade and die— You steal as well the personality. You steal the self—you “smooth away” the thing That long life, struggling life, alone can bring; You blur the sacred lessons of the years, Learnt doubtless, some, through grief and tears. “Repose”—I grant you this, but life is dear, Nought else we know of here: To see the “lines” “smoothed out,” when fails the breath, To me brings horror and accentuates death. LXXIV. The streets so empty seem! I wander through them, weary and sad: Where once so many hearts were glad I move, as in a dream. So it will be, till after many days Or few (fewer pangs to bear!) I pass from London's thinly-peopled ways To crowded paths and populous streets elsewhere. LXXV. Upon this Sabbath day I dream of summer Sabbaths long ago, Far oh! so far away— Ere hope died out and doubt had time to grow. We sought the small white church, my mother and I— The heath stretched green and wide: We walked on side by side: Above us burned the cloudless summer sky. All was so perfect then, So joyous and complete;— God, was it well to make those days so sweet If that pure joy can ne'er be ours again? LXXVI. So much there is to say! Her grief with mine would be so wholly one. If mother could but speak to son For one half-hour, on but one day! One day in all the year— The heart might then less wildly ache, The dawn less sadly break, With less of stormy pain or sunless fear. There must be since she died Such worlds on worlds in either heart Pent-up—so much to ask, so much to impart On either side. LXXVII. If lordliest strength of song were mine Still would it be worth while To add sweet verse to verse and line to line— Without the mother's eyes, the mother's smile? I lift the pen...I let it fall... No labour now on earth Seems of the slightest worth: The shadow of death broods over all. LXXVIII. Who hath not felt despair Hath never loved at all: Yea, whoso sayeth that death doth not appal Hath sought no grave, nor felt the darkness there. But whoso loveth well, He sayeth with anguished heart, “Thou glib and easy, smooth-tongued hope, depart! Truth, truth alone, unbars the gates of hell.” LXXIX. This sorrow sometimes brings— That round about our path small fair white flowers All undiscerned in gladness' hours We now perceive; or forth some new bud springs. And larger flowers the searching hand may glean— Blossoms of love we saw not heretofore Or, seeing so close at hand, glanced at no more; These now yield fragrance unforeseen. So, wife, thy love for me reveals, Now that I walk beneath the shadow of night, Now that unlooked-for grief appeals, Undreamed-of depth and height. LXXX. In after-years, Though it may seem that boyhood's memories fade Shrouded in far-off shade, They never fade—they thrill the soul to tears. The true sweet lessons taught By a mother's voice, a mother's eyes, These influence all our after-thought:— The whole day's doom is settled at sunrise. LXXXI. Though manhood's creed may change,— Though faith's tired ship may wander far from home, Tossed 'mid unkindred waves and alien foam, Entering new ports and strange,— Still will the thought most pure and undefiled Of early faith, of early prayer, Weigh with the man, recalling everywhere The creed the mother taught the child. LXXXII. Enter a graveyard—all around you see, Though warm on turf and marble falls the sun, Though round the green banks hums the bee, Signs of Death's conquest won. Just here and there a few sad blossoms shine— What art thou doing, O rose? No blossom here of royal line Without reluctance grows. “In loving memory.” So the legend runs: What memories here unite! Memories of moonlit hours, of August suns,— Memories of young years bathed in golden light. “In loving memory.” Countless souls have wept; The graveyard takes no note of groan or tear. No lasting record can be kept Of those who are resting here. “In loving memory.” Round each sacred word, Urged on by Time, the sluggish moss will creep: Ah! those who loved, in love's sweet weakness erred Deeming they graved so deep. LXXXIII. Each day I miss thee more, In that the friends who thronged around Pass—each on his own mission bound— And all goes on as heretofore. Each day more clearly—this perhaps is well— The difference measureless I see, Mother, between the love that spake through thee And love that speaks—with its own tale to tell. LXXXIV. Sometimes, when music speaks, The dead return. For one sweet hour The fields of youth around me flower: Life's warm blood tinges ghostly lips and cheeks. But when the music fails, then oh! Gone are the flowers, fled are the ghostly folk— It is as if from summer dreams one woke Upon a world of snow. LXXXV. At times I pray that Fate may place Vast leagues of deathless air and griefless space Between me and the spot Where thou wast with me once, and now art not. Wide fields made fragrant with sweet summer's breath, Valleys that know not death, Hills with no clouds of sorrow overcast, These interpose between me and the past! New cities I would see And in them feel more near to thee Perchance beneath a heaven of cloudless blue Than in the sunless town that slew. So for one hour I dream— Then fades the light from mountain, tower, and stream: My home seems here, in London's gloom; I long to live and die beside thy tomb. LXXXVI. Once did I dream—for but one moment's space— Of the belovéd face: God sends not such dreams twice; One unforeseen glad instant must suffice. One word is spoken in extremest need: Well must the listener heed! One moment flashes forth the heavenly light; Then silence, and the night. A thousand dreams of stars and flowers and sun— Of her alas! but one: With deepest awe, with measureless surprise, I heard her voice and met her eyes. “Do what is given you”—this, I know, she said, Standing beside my bed: Once—only once—the dear voice spoke; I marvelled, and I woke. LXXXVII. Most desolate is this universe of ours! The very stars must pass away With all their human lives, with all their flowers: To them their centuries seem but as a day We mourn our ceaseless dead— But there are countless stars whose light Is quenched within the eternal night, Whose last word has been said. Far more in number than the bright live orbs Are these whose work is done: Their ranks are ever swollen, as time absorbs The light and heat of many an aging sun. In this vast pathless universe I groan; I have no hold on night, no grasp of day: O mother, thou wast all my own! When thou wast here, I never lost my way. LXXXVIII. A child was gathering blossoms in a lane: She turned now and again To meet the mother's glance, the eyes that smiled Their deep love on the child. Then all was well—one short sigh of relief— No dread, no thought of grief. Now back once more to search the grassy banks And thin the cowslip-ranks! I watched:—I heard a sudden cry, “Mother!” The sun was sinking in the sky; Dark clouds assailed him on his golden throne, Evening approached: the child was now alone. The mother's form had passed beyond her sight: I saw the blossoms just now held so tight Dropped from the trembling fingers one by one. ...How is it, mother, with thy son? One thought is left, but one—to overtake, Though foot may weary, heart may break: Once more, ere falls the darkness, lowers the storm, To see, to clasp, the mother's form. LXXXIX. ...The child? Ah! she will see Beyond that turning, past that gate or tree, The mother—sobs will cease; For her wild grief will change to perfect peace. For her the sunset heavens will clear; The purple clouds that threatened came not near: No star will veil its splendour; night will be Spread over windless hills and waveless sea. But I—ere I may stand Holding, alive in mine, the far-off hand, Ere I may overtake the far-off form, Above my head must burst the boundless storm. XC. Yet ought I to despair? When one so pure and sweet has passed away, Does her hand point to darkness or to day? To gloom or sunlit air? Her life was tenderest love, from end to end. Can such supreme love die— Be mixed with stars or sky? Is not the vanished still the present Friend? Mother, where art thou now? Not surely in the tomb! Not there the loving eyes, the stainless brow, Not there—but far beyond death's mists and gloom. Thou wouldst not have me weep; This much—amid the sorrow—this I know: Thou sentest me the sleep That gave me strength to bear the unmeasured woe. If I give way to pain My pain, O mother-heart, may trouble thee. What thou wouldst have me gain Is strength—and selfless love, and purity. It may be that my eyes That linger overlong upon thy tomb Should now reseek the skies Where deathless starlight battles still with gloom. It may be that thou say'st With voice more sweet than morning's sweetest song, “I tarry for thee, son—be brave, be strong; So shall the hours make haste.” XCI. 'Tis said of grief's wild dart However near its dripping red point goes That God goes nearer, and can interpose Himself between the spear-point and the heart. If this be so, though we discern not how, How close God stands to every being born, If every thorn-point in each crown of thorn Wounds God's, not only wounds each human brow! XCII. Deep is the human heart: When anguish comes, how true friends rally round; If human love had power, then death discrowned And forceless would depart. But human love has power—to this extent, That the mute frozen horror melts at last; The pain no human strength can bear is past; By whom were loving friends who saved me sent? By whom if not by thee, Mother, whose care still active from above Incarnate once is unincarnate love And perfect ever-present sympathy. Old enmities give way Buried in love's vast overwhelming wave, And hearts estranged to-day Grow one, though one in tears, beside thy grave. XCIII. So large the army grows, The unseen army of the well-loved dead! We, here, for yet a little while make head Against unnumbered foes. But broken is the square—now back to back Or side by side we stand, A small sore-smitten band; Blood freely runs and corpses strew the track. And yet amid wild blows Somewhat of strange delight Waxes and heightens, thrills the heart and glows: So much of day is done, so near is night. So near is night, when on the hard-fought field As the great moon from silent heaven peers down The square that would not yield Will rest—for every brow has won death's crown. XCIV. But yet a greater host Of silent mourners seems to encompass me: They cross the wastes of many a shadowy sea Swift-hovering, ghost on ghost. They cross the unknown years; They say, with grasp of hand or loving look, “From each of us death took A mother”—then their eyes grow dim with tears. Then through the darkness starlight slowly flows, A strange sense thrills me as of love drawn nigh: They say, “Thou knowest not what it is to die; What warrior dreams of rest 'mid shouts and blows? “From each of us death stole Our dearest,—but to each did Love restore That dearest spirit:” I wait to gather more; Nay, silence—but less strife within the soul. XCV. “Must many nights and mornings flee away Ere comes the all-golden day When we shall meet?” I said, And sought news of the dead. No answer reached me. Then again I cried, “However wildly I grieve If unto thee I leave All times and seasons, is my prayer denied? “Wilt thou, if thus I trust, Promise while I thy sacred oath record That we shall meet, though this our star be dust?” “I promise:” said the Lord. XCVI. 'Tis right the sun should shine, the blossoms blow, Though, mother, thou art gone: 'Tis right the stream of life should still flow on; And who am I to say thou dost not know? The spring that comes may bring Not only joy to man, but joy to thee. 'Tis well that once again should smile the sea, The birds once more with unchanged sweetness sing. When in the fields and lanes Once more the cowslips and the kingcups blow, Mother, I will not say thou dost not know,— I will not say no sunlit spot remains. Renew thy wondrous tints, thou radiant rose, And thou, white lily, don thy tenderest white! My mother loves, my mother knows: Wear lovelier robes, to gladden keener sight. XCVII. I owe a debt of thanks To him who chose from out the angelic ranks One having power to kill With sweetest tenderness and perfect skill. So sad it might have been! Some noble souls die hard, Tortured and racked, pain-marred: Some suffer terribly, and not for sin. But she, my mother, gently fell asleep. No time to raise a hand; The attack was subtly planned; The eyes closed, ere the eyes had time to weep. The head not even dropped Forward, but on the pillow calmly lay: The heart that beat for me by night, by day, Wavered—then softly stopped. XCVIII. Yet other thanks I owe To him the guardian Power who guides our way That every sense was clear when closed the day; Clear almost as beneath the morning's glow. The eyes that in the far-off days looked down, Ever with love, on flower and flower, Growing in love, ne'er failed in power: Death, having force to slay, could not discrown. Still were the stars discerned As clearly as when in years long dead, Mother, upon thy bridal night they burned: No tiniest star could veil its golden head. And still was music sweet. Thine ears that ever heard Love's pæan sung Lost still few notes, however soft or fleet, Of notes that charmed in days when thou wast young. XCIX. And this is sweet to think— That through long years thy firm faith never failed: Failed neither at death's dim brink, Nor in those earlier days when doubt assailed. I, later born in this The saddest century since the news went round That death was sceptreless and Christ was crowned,— I, seeking hope, full often sought amiss. Doubt smote, and smote me hard. I, seeking God, full often found instead Darkness, and thoughts ill-starred; I sought Christ overlong amid the dead. But thou, whom love inspired, Didst seek thy Saviour without doubts or fears: Thou soon didst gain the goal that I desired And still desire, with tears. While I was lingering at the ill-fated tomb Where Jesus' corpse in desolation lay, Thine eyes could pierce the gloom: Heaven thou didst reach,—and by a nobler way. As Jesus first appeared To Mary, so when thy pure aid I sought I found sweet faith within thy being inwrought; Thought's stormy dark heaven cleared. For God appeared to thee Though not in waves or sun: While I was seeking God within the sea Or in the mountains, thou with God wast one. The poet seeks—and finds Somewhat divine within the wild waves' roar, Within the music of the warring winds, Upon the storm-swept shore. But thou who carriedst God within thine heart Hadst never need of Nature's kiss, Though sweet to thee was this And sweet the land of Art. Thou wast so near to God that every day When God's clear sunshine rose No dark doubts fled away: Love questions not, but knows. C. And now I hold thy letters in my hand: As from another land They come—they deepen holiest grief, And yet bring some relief. They speak of meeting—simple words and wise— Not overmuch is said: Yet in each sacred phrase a volume lies For she who wrote is dead. A few sweet thoughts and perfect words suffice,— But the whole soul is there: No fruitless sorrow, no prolonged advice, Only a mother's heart laid bare. Enough it is. I thank thee for the gift Sent from God's starriest sky That bids me not despair, but ever lift My thoughts from death to love that cannot die. CI. They say that “Jesus wept.” Sweet is the old record, sweet the loving thought— God into contact with our sorrow brought; Heaven's boundary over-stept. Dogmas? Save this point, none; That through the heart of man in saddest hour Flashed the conviction that some deathless Power Crossed swords with death—and won. CII. They say that Jesus “rose.” Sweet is the old record, sweet the gracious thought— God with our griefs and agonies inwrought; God conscious of our woes: God, lord of life and master of the sun, Encountering starless night,— Putting to desperate flight The hosts that rule the darkness, one by one. Dogmas? Nay, Love instead! No thought abides save this, That Love's eternal kiss Hath fallen upon the forehead of the dead; That at that kiss the dead May pass into the land of light supreme, Where joy is real and sorrow is the dream And “Farewell” is not said. Mother, if Jesus rose, Then thou in God's sweet strength hast risen as well; When o'er thy brow the solemn darkness fell It was but for one moment of repose. Thy love is mine—my deathless love to thee! May God's love guard us till all death is o'er,— Till thine eyes meet my sorrowing eyes once more,— Then guard us still, through all eternity! THE STORY OF THE LIFE OF CALEB SMITH THE METHODIST MINISTER TOLD BY HIMSELF This poem—which has been much misunderstood—is simply intended as a study of the phases through which an originally religious and devoted spirit passes, who has been driven by a succession of the cruellest shocks from faith in God to pessimism, and from pessimism to sheer madness. It seems hardly necessary to say—and yet it must be said—that Caleb Smith was utterly wrong in his inferences. He was imbued with the ever-rigid idea of the unity of the world-force which prevailed during the reigns of Huxley, Darwin, Tyndall, and their group, and he failed to discern the vast correlative fact which is now becoming daily more obvious; the fact, namely, that the personal power of God eternally wages war with personal powers of evil. In his scientific madness he attributed Satan's action to God. His agony of doubt was in exact proportion to his previous rapture of belief. When he seems to rail at God, his heart is in reality like the heart of a child, who, having believed with utter abandonment of faith that his father was supreme and omnipotent, weeps for grief and disappointment at seeing that father disregarded and dishonoured. The poem is, in fact, a cry of love turned into horror, and its true moral is: Shun pessimism as you would a pestilence. Believe in God and good eternally, and fight with and for God against all that is evil and dark and impure. Greater is he that is for you than he that is against you. I would like to add that I have now come to see that the views which I expressed in the preface to the First Edition of “The Crucifixion of Man” were quite erroneous, and that Laurence Oliphant, whose opinions I there opposed, was, after all, nearer to the truth than I was. January, 1902. G. B. What a change from London, drearier as the hot days hotter grew, To the silent bay in Cornwall, to the calm sea's ceaseless blue, To the breeze from off the moorlands! What a change for her and me From the hospital in London to the hospice of the sea! —Living quietly down in Cornwall with my mother, we alone, Having nothing of a week-day we could call our very own (On the Sabbath I was busy with the chapel-service, quite, Busy from the early morning till the stars shone out at night)— Having nothing of a week-day we could care for just as ours, Save the fuchsias in the window—what to living hearts are flowers? I had brought away from London a small girlish flower-bud dropt From some heavenly hand, we fancied, for our lone hearts to adopt. She was daughter of a teacher—in a village school she had taught, But some handsome roué from London whom Fate's reckless guidance brought To her peaceful home in Sussex taught her love, and taught her well, For he found her safe in heaven, but he left her lost in hell. That was dark-eyed Annie's mother—through the round of sin and shame She had passed when he forsook her—to the lowest deep she came Till the hospital received her, and I found her lying there, Just a mournful wreck of beauty, once a woman strangely fair. I had taken a friend's sad duty, taken his mission for the day, Just to visit these poor outcasts, and to speak to them, and pray; So it happened that I saw her,—heard her pale sad lips impart Just an every-day sad story, merely of one more broken heart. So it happened, a while later, when the mother's fate was sealed And the gateways of the darkness at her frail touch 'gan to yield, That I promised on her death-bed that my mother and I would take Her small darling child, and rear it with all kindness for her sake. Down in sunny quiet Cornwall, as the months and years sped on, First she grew to girlish beauty,—then a tenderer sweetness shone In her eyes, her figure rounded. Which is loveliest in a rose? Its coy beauty when it's budding, or its splendour when it blows? Hardly tongue of man can answer—hardly tongue of man could tell Which was loveliest, childish Annie, at whose feet the bright leaves fell In the autumn, one might fancy, just to hear the laugh that rang As her childish steps pursued them, or the girl whose sweet voice sang. Yes: for ever she was singing, with a voice that mocked the birds, Putting wonderful new sweetness into even the homeliest words; Singing to the morning breezes, singing to the midday sun, Singing to the stars that listened when the summer day was done. Ah: how often have I watching seen some stalwart sailor stand Silent in the narrow roadway, with his nets in sunburnt hand, Listening as she sang some love-song, with his dark eyes full of tears: Leagues away the sweet voice took him, to far other lands and years. And I've seen a mother listening, with sad eager eyes and deep, To a wild song of the storm-wind, and I've seen her turn and weep, For she thought—her eyes disclosed it—all her heart was plain to me— Of some sailor-boy, the offering of the storm-wind to the sea. And the younger women listened, as the girl's pure sweet voice rang, And I knew their hearts were hanging on each simple word she sang: They were dreaming of their sweethearts, of the lads they loved so well, And to each the song spoke gently, with its own strange tale to tell. So the days and years fled past us, and I rendered thanks and praise To the good God who had sent us such a help for lonely days. We should nevermore be lonely. Could one's heart ache when she smiled? Was she not our own for ever? Was the girl not as the child? But a mighty change came o'er me, for one lovely August morn Off we started, I and Annie, and we walked through fields of corn, Over many a breezy hill-top, while the sea beneath us shone, Flashed its sapphires in the sunlight, as it smiled up at the sun. There the fishing-boats were lying which in winter-time had dashed Through the blinding whirling snow-storms, while the thunderous great waves crashed Over gunwale, over bulwark; there they rested like the boats On some silent summer river, where the untrembling lily floats. Oh, the splendour of that morning! How it all comes back to me! The sweet scent from cottage gardens, and the fresh scent from the sea: Endless perfect radiant sunlight poured on meadow, hill, and plain; For one hour the calm of Eden seemed to rest on earth again. Hard it was, most hard, to fancy that the golden fields of corn Ever by the winds of autumn had been smitten and lashed and torn: Hard it was before the vision to call up the breakers white, Filling all the bay in winter with their thunder day and night. Perfect peace upon the waters—now the soft breeze sang a psalm; The old trumpet-throated storm-wind had subsided into calm. Perfect peace upon the moorland—dark the silent fir-clumps gleamed, And within them the wood-pigeon murmured gently as she dreamed. Wondrous light upon the town too; as we clambered up the hill All the houses down below us seemed asleep, they were so still: Little quiet whitewashed houses—all was peace in Newlyn town; Peace and rest and golden sunlight, so it seemed as we looked down. Such a sense there was in Nature, past the reach of words or Art, Of a silent something waiting, of a loving spirit and heart. I could almost feel the sweetness of a kiss within the air: Almost catch within the cornfields the quick flash of golden hair. Never till that very morning had the strange sense come to me Of a life behind all Nature, of a soul within the sea; Of a glory past expression, of a rapture to be won From the silent heart of Nature, of a secret in the sun. As we passed the cottage gardens where in sunlit soft repose Gleamed the giant climbing fuchsias, the geranium and the rose, I could see and love the blossoms, but the blossoms' selves were nought: There was something hid behind them, even a sweet creative Thought. There was then a soul in Nature—all was soulless, dark, no more; There was woman's silvery laughter in the wave-pulse on the shore: There was mystic meaning hidden in the dark-blue depth of air; Far within the being of Nature was a Presence yet more fair. And this Presence, turning meward, filled the land and filled the sky With a glory vast and solemn, with a rapture pure and high: I could reach the sacred Presence, I could worship at its shrine; More—my very soul could claim it, I could murmur, “Thou art mine!” There was something, deep in Nature—something sweet to be attained; Heights of holy love to reach to, sacred friendship to be gained: Something strange that, ever eluding mortal grasp and touch of hand, Seemed to whisper, “Yet I love you—yet I smile and understand!” “I am weary of the cornfields, I am weary of the air Full of scents of radiant summer, I am weary of the fair Starlit night that follows sunset, I am weary of the tides Laving lonely coasts of granite and lone coral-islands' sides; “I am weary of the sunrise over mountains lone and vast, I am weary of dead ages, I am weary of my past; I am weary of the worship of the star-hosts as they wheel, As they dress their ranks obedient to the bugling thunder-peal; “I am weary: I am eager not for soulless sympathy Of my soulless white-sailed cloud-ships as they plunge along the sky; I would see my love reflected in the human soul, my thought In the brain that I for ages past man's lengthiest dream have wrought.” So the loving sweet voice whispered—then it changed to mocking mirth, Saying, “Yet I dwell in dreamland, I am part not of the earth: Never human soul shall reach me till the course of time is run, For I dwell beyond the sunset, and I dwell beyond the sun. “Mightiest poets all have sought me—they have found me passing fair; They have sung the glittering radiance of the morning in my hair: Every soul has thought to claim me—each has seen within my eyes, When he dreamed that he possessed me, the first virgin teardrops rise. “Byron thought our wedding-chamber was the palace of the sea; Wordsworth sought me on the mountains, Shelley sought in Italy, And the lips of Keats my lover on my own lips seemed to close So he fancied in the violet, so he felt within the rose. “What the Christians find in Jesus, other loving souls have found In the golden light of morning, in the rushing rivers' sound: Yes, a godhead is in Nature, a divinity in me; Once God thundered upon Sinai—now he thunders through the sea! “Now he thunders on your mountains—when your mighty poet heard Jura thunder, he was listening just as surely to the word Of Jehovah as was Moses in the desert lone and grim: Ever in Nature ye may find me, though to-day ye find not him. “Though the Jewish God has vanished, though his angry lightnings gleam Down the rocky heights no longer, though his kingdom was a dream, I am living, I am with you, there is majesty in me: In the red rose there is passion—there is love within the sea.” So the sweet voice seemed to whisper, and I fancied as I heard That a tenderer soft note sounded from the throat of every bird,— That the lovely colour deepened in the flowers beside the road,— That the sea's plain in the distance with a nobler radiance glowed: And a wondrous sense came o'er me that for me that very day Virgin was the spirit of Nature, that within my arms she lay Never touched and never fondled, that she cared for me alone; That she deigned to love a mortal, and to draw him towards her throne. Though the far primordial hill-tops and the ancient winds and streams Wrought their passion into music and had brought a million dreams, Though man's heart throughout the ages had paid homage at her shrine, Yet that day the spirit of Nature seemed superbly, wholly, mine. But the loving spirit of Nature had yet further gifts in store:— Turning homeward, round the cliff-tops, as we gazed on sea and shore Came the marvel of the sunset—as the sun sank to his grave Such a flood of golden glory lighted cliff and beach and wave! Golden glory—stainless molten glowing wonderful deep gold: Many a sunset from those cliff-tops had I watched and loved of old, Never sunset quite so perfect, never sunset so divine,— All the stars' whole wealth of radiance in its least ray seemed to shine. This was Nature's bridal raiment, thus was Nature robed for me In this golden wedding-garment flung across the sky and sea. All that day had Nature wooed me, but her noblest gift was this; With her soft voice she had charmed me—now she thrilled me with her kiss. —That was just one August sunset; but the glories never known! Wealth of tropical strange sunsets where the weird sun sets alone Over lonely wastes of water, or by reed-swamps dim and deep, From his lonely labour passing to his loveless lonelier sleep! Glory of prehistoric sunsets, when no man's eye might behold All the Western far heaven flushing or with rose-tints or with gold: When no lover whispered gently, “Though the sun beyond the sky Should depart and dwell for ever, golden love would never die!” Sunsets it may be in star-land, countless sunsets it may be Over starry silent oceans, many a dark-blue astral sea; These the Spirit of Nature painting ever paints alone, apart, Mocking human pen and pencil, with strange laughter at her heart. “Would one human artist follow? Can he pass amid the stars? Can he cross their golden portals? Can he leap their harbourbars? Lo! I paint ten million sunsets, while he strives to understand Just one earthly sunset colouring half a mile of sea and land. “While the deep sea drags a vessel down beneath the tossing foam In the heaven I mix my colours, fiery lake and magic chrome; In the peaceful heaven above them, while the sailors shriek distraught, I achieve a feat of sunset Turner's genius never wrought. ‘Painters, poets, all have striven—all have failed to follow me When my brush sweeps o'er the canvas of the answering sky or sea. They may struggle, they may marvel—Nay, the flamelit sunset air That for me breathes only triumph for man's genius breathes despair.” Then the next day in the chapel, lovely summer still without, How I preached, with what an unction! Not one single shadow of doubt Crossed the preacher's mind that morning—all he said, to him was true; So his passion reached the people and it held them spellbound too. I had preached to them of Jesus, I had told them of his grace; I had drawn them moving pictures of the Saviour's grief-lined face; I had preached to them of heaven—I had pictured to my fold Heavenly doorways bright with jewels, heavenly mansions wrought of gold. I had told them that the Saviour is not dead—that still he stands With the infinite same pity in his heart and outstretched hands: That the Father's heart is changeless; that to every soul who wills Jesus speaks his Father's message, by our Cornish rocks and hills. “Is there one heart in this chapel full of sadness?” so I had said; “Let him grasp the fact eternal that the Saviour is not dead: He is living yet to pity, he is living to redeem— All of real life is the Christian's, all the world's life is a dream. “As he spake to his disciples by the Galilean sea So he speaks to-day in Cornwall, so he speaks to you and me: He is near us, he is with us, and he sees with pitying glance Every suffering soul in Newlyn, every sorrow in Penzance. “Though your boats upon the Atlantic, not on any inland lake, Bury deep their bows in winter when the thundering great waves break, Tremble not, for he is near you—aye, the tiller is in his hand, And it has not lost its cunning—he can steer your boat to land. “Jesus dreads not all the Atlantic; he is just as much at home On your vessels, when you are blinded with the scudding sleet and foam, As on boats of humbler fashion on a sea of humbler waves When he succoured other sailors. Still he watches, still he saves. “Not the sea alone he conquers, all of Nature he can rule: By his grace the water-lily buoys its white cup on the pool. Nature is but as his servant, and beyond the sights we see There are sights more glorious waiting, waiting in eternity. “Past the blue waves of the ocean there are bluer waves than ours, And the roses at your windows tell of heavenly fairer flowers: For each passion that we conquer, for each joy that we disdain, There are heavenly high gifts waiting, when our Master comes to reign. “Comes to reign, for he will surely from the highest heaven descend And all human sins and sorrows, aye the world's whole life, shall end: There are many—I believe it—even now living who will see Jesus coming in his glory, in his power and majesty. “Oh, the flowers of earth are nothing! oh, the loves of earth are nought! Oh, the joys of earth are trifles, hardly worth a passing thought! Earthly flowers may dread the winter, mortal sunshine yield to night, I proclaim the life immortal where the Lord God is the light.” —But that day I preached of Nature, for the spirit of Nature seized All my soul and chained and held me, and compelled me as she pleased: I was thinking of the sunlight on the sea the day before— How it glittered on the ocean, how it gleamed along the shore. “Heaven is close, aye all around you!” so I cried to them that day; “It is in the golden sunlight as it flashes on the bay: Even the highest heaven is sunless when God sends, some summer morn, All the sunlight he can gather to assist your fields of corn. “Moonless, starless are the heavens, lampless is God's house on high Sometimes, when the lamps immortal gleam across a mortal sky,— And the angels seem less stately, and their gold robes seem less fair, When the glory of God's sunlight glitters through a woman's hair. “Woman was not made to tempt us! Was not Christ, the God-child, born Of the pure womb of a Virgin? Did the world's Creator scorn Even the lowly flesh of woman? Was it not the great God's plan Through the stainless heart of Mary to redeem the race of man? “Sacred evermore is woman, sacred is this world of ours, For the fingers of its Maker now have plucked its humble flowers: Sacred are its fields and valleys, and its mountain-heights sublime, For eternity has sought us, and has kissed the lips of time. “Now the heart of God that revelled through the years that baffle thought Far in heaven 'mid heavenly splendour loves the flowers his earth has brought, And a fairer light than heavenly is in sunlit Cornish skies.” Then I stepped down from the pulpit—and my eyes met Annie's eyes. Next there came a time of horror, when my soul saw nought of light, Wildly longed by day for Annie, then yearned heavenward through the night; Till at last my thought grew clearer—I would seek the friendly sea— The vast loveless waves should heal me and the winds should set me free. Round the coast just now was sailing, ere the summer days were spent, The dark fleet of herring-fishers, on their Northward voyage intent, From Penzance to Whitby steering: I would join them once again; Strangle love, the sea's strength helping—stifle love, and deaden pain. So I sailed with them and struggled, was victorious for awhile, Dreamed of passionless cold sea-wastes and the white moon's loveless smile— Dreamed that love had never thrilled me, dreamed my heart was wholly dead— Till one starlit night we anchored, half the fleet, off Beachy Head. Then there came through all the calmness of that starlit night at sea The full fierce storm of reaction, smiting body and soul of me: While the stars upon the water in untroubled silence gleamed Thus my storm-tossed troubled spirit in its starless anguish dreamed:— “What a peace upon the waters! What a storm within my soul! Through my heart the giant surges of an endless sorrow roll: All is calm and still around me, countless stars above me shine, And the peace of God is in them, but the travail of man is mine. “Shall I never win God's peace now? must I bid sweet love depart? Wrench the image of a woman, and for ever, from my heart? On the land the roses blossom, and God bending from his throne Sends them love and sends them fragrance: I am loveless, I alone. “Star to star sends holiest greeting,—even the sea-bird from the wave Takes not back the kiss that, passing, with its swift white wing it gave: But God sends a heart to love me—then he takes that heart from me; I am lonelier than the lone stars, I am lonelier than the sea. “In the morning past the green banks in our Cornwall she will go, Through the lovely Cornish deep lanes draped with fern-fronds loiter slow: Will she think of me, I wonder? Will the fern-fronds hear her sigh? Or will all be peace and gladness like the gladness of the sky? “Bird to bird will softly murmur, ‘This is fairy-land's pure queen Sent to tarry here with mortals, for a season known and seen: How the heart of man must love her?’ Then the violet in repose On the mossy bank will whispher, ‘She is lovelier than the rose! “‘Though I love the wild red rosebud, she is lovelier far than this!’ Then the wild red rose will murmur, ‘Though I love the violet's kiss There's a softer sweet kiss waiting, there's a sweeter mouth than hers; Aye, a noble kiss more luscious than the flower-kiss of the furze. “‘I am only a hedgerow blossom—I would die in her embrace Were I but a man to love her, were I in her lover's place! I would bring the whole world's emeralds, every ruby I would take; I would search the depths for diamonds, sack the gold-fields for her sake. “‘That must be the glory of loving,’ so the rose will murmur low, ‘Not to rest among the hedge-leaves while the days pass, dull and slow, But to ruin oneself for love's sake—ruin the world, if that may be! Steal the stars to fill love's coffers, drag lost treasures from the sea. “‘Were I but a man, my violet, were my violet but a maid, I would lift her into sunlight, I would lift her from the shade: I would chaffer with the angels, bring their choicest gold robes down; I would even drive a bargain with Jehovah for his crown!’— “So the wild red rose will whisper, as it were rebuking me. Have I torn for her strange treasures from the green depths of the sea? Have I brought her rubies, sapphires? There are nobler jewels above: These I craved for, these I sought for—and my heart was closed to love. “O my Master, have I left you? Is there even a stronger power In the world than that of Jesus? Is this simple snow-white flower, Even the flower of love that Jesus in his kingly sternness scorns, Far more potent through its fragrance than his pale wreath through its thorns? “Have I after all been preaching of the life beyond the tomb, Preaching of the heavenly blossoms, while I loved a lily in bloom Here on earth? Have I been preaching of sunlight beyond the skies, Dazzled all the while with starlight, even the light in Annie's eyes? “Have I only dreamed of Jesus? Have I acted all the while As if dearer far than Jesus was a girl's quick sudden smile? Have I been content with fancies of the sinless heavenly land While to me the heavenliest rapture would have been to kiss her hand? “All these years have I been traitor—yes, a traitor to my Lord? When I thought I worshipped Jesus, it was Annie I adored: When I thought the Spirit of Nature spoke from wave and bush and flower, It was Annie whom I worshipped,—she was sovereign in that hour. “It was not the Spirit of Nature, it was passion after all, Just the same old pagan passion—what a hideous lapse and fall! I had sworn to banish passion from my life—to live and die As a preacher of the gospel, with my home beyond the sky— “I had preached of self-denial—I was conquered, I was base, Conquered by a girl's young laughter, by the young pure lovely face: Venus still alas! was living; I was sin-stained and defiled; Madly (I see) I loved the woman, while I thought I loved the child! “While I taught her of the next world, she was slowly teaching me Just what Venus taught to mortals when she sprang from out the sea. I was teacher—she was pupil—but the pupil was more wise; While I taught with pen and pencil, she was teaching with her eyes.” So I reasoned through the night-time, but my spirit reached no goal: Star to star gave loving answer, but they spake not to my soul. I was left alone and joyless 'mid the universal peace; “Love is born,” my heart had whispered—now it whispered “Love must cease.” But the morning came resplendent—when the summer night was done All the sea flashed laughing answer to the first kiss of the sun, And my soul flashed laughing answer to the thought that in it lay: All my past life had been darkness—Now at last triumphant day! Now at last sunrise immortal! As I gazed across the waves Leaping, smiling, snowy-crested, could one dream that they were graves? Never! Where was thought of shipwreck? Surely shipwreck could be none In a world where such blue waters laughed beneath so bright a sun! All was peace and all was beauty. Could I dream that love was wrong Listening, as my whole soul listened, to the bright waves' morning song? Was not passion in the sunlight, was not passion in the sea? Was not passion too in God's heart, doubtless, from eternity? Had some souls perchance made shipwreck through their passion, so 'twas said? Yet behold the flood of sunlight flashing down on Beachy Head! Beachy Head had seen its wreckage: Beachy Head that summer morn Laughed the very thought of shipwreck 'neath its high white cliffs to scorn. No: there never had been shipwreck—it was but a dream of pain, And there never could be shipwreck on this sapphire sea again;— Never wreck of any vessel, or of any soul should be, For God vowed it through the sunlight, and he promised through the sea. All the universe was passion; all the universe proclaimed The pure glory of love for ever, with a million tongues unshamed: Every flower on earth proclaimed it, every wave upon the deep; Would God plant love's golden cornfield, then forbid man's hand to reap? Annie—yes, my love for Annie was one verse, one radiant line, Of the universal poem written by the hand divine: I could add one perfect stanza to the world's vast hymn of praise; Though the ages' joy was in it, I could add one summer day's! I could write one passionate lyric, one small song, if heaven should please, Though the Epics were Jehovah's and the vast Odes were the sea's; Though the sweetest tenderest poems bore God's signature, 'tis true, Yet I, loving past expression, could strike out some music too. So my soul won liberation: as the sun climbed higher I saw All my future stretched before me with a throbbing sense of awe; All our future—yes, our future—for my life and hers were one,— So God promised through the bright sea, and he sware it by the sun. What it many a soul, defeated, down had sunk beside the way? She and I would be victorious! love at last should have its day! Were a thousand women traitors, yet one woman (sang the sea) Would be loyal and true for ever, and bring perfect love to me. Yes, to-day creation started on its journey quite anew: For the first time heaven was cloudless, and the sea was stainless blue. Though a thousand women wavered, yet one woman (said the sun) Through all life would follow bravely—and my Annie was that one. I would carry out my purpose now my heart had found repose, Would not quit my sailor comrades till their summer journey's close: I would watch them at their fishing; I would preach (with what a force!) I would let all things that summer take their old unaltered course. Then when they were leaving Whitby, sailing South and sailing West In the first days of the autumn, I would travel with the rest: When the summer was quite over, then my summer should begin; I sailed North to lose a life's love—I would Southward sail to win. I would Southward sail to win her. Oh, my darling, waiting there, Far in dear old magic Cornwall, joy is sometimes hard to bear! I should find her as I left her, hear her sing that old sweet song; Tell her—tell her how I loved her—though she knew it all along. Why, when hopes of man are fairest, does some dark fate dash them down? Does it give the Lord God pleasure first to crown us, then discrown? —When I came again to Cornwall, with the first autumnal leaf, Love, who had given me lordly pleasure, brought me never-dying grief. She was gone—to her destruction—so they told me, when I came; If she had not fallen already, she was on the road to shame: Dazzled by the foolish glitter of a troop of acting knaves She had joined the troop of players,—she had left our moors and waves. She had left Penzance for ever—so the little letter said That my mother grave-eyed gave me—would we think of her as dead? She was weary of quiet pleasures—she remembered all we had done— But the wide sweet world was waiting—there were grand crowns to be won! There were crowns of fame and love-crowns, so the poor sad scrawl went on: She could never rest contented here to live and die unknown; I must never never seek her, she would not disgrace us, no— It was her own choice, her doing; she had freely chosen to go. She had joined the travelling actors for a season, so she said: That was just as a beginning—soon she would be better paid; She would send us wondrous presents from great London,—she was told That her voice alone would bring her fabulous wealth, uncounted gold. We were not to be too sorry—she would far far happier be In the midst of wild excitement than by our grey lonely sea; For she needed wild excitement—it was always rest to dance, And I knew what dull companions came to see her at Penzance. She did so like jolly people! all the actors were so bright— Got up late and tired, that's certain, but they sat up half the night Talking, singing, telling stories—and the acting was great fun; She liked gaslight, always, better than the ugly glaring sun. She would like me to be sorry—just a little—for her sake; Sorry only just a little—did not want my heart to break: I should doubtless soon find some one who would make me a better wife (If indeed like that I loved her)—mine was not her view of life. She was grateful, very grateful—we had always been most kind; We must try now to forget her, try not overmuch to mind: When she thought of all our goodness the thought always made her cry, But then crying made her eyes red—that would never do—Good-bye! So the weary search began then, and for months that search went on: Half through England I went seeking, silent, grim, forlorn, alone, Past all human words despairing, with despair that mixed with shame, For I knew well, if I found her, she would never be the same. No: the damning step was taken. Fate had tossed her on the sea Of the great world, given the devil his grand opportunity: If the devil did not seize it, he was not the devil of old, Swaying man by lust of woman, woman's heart by lust of gold. As the dark sad thought flashed through me, I remembered where he reigns, Satan, chiefliest crowned as monarch, not as king of hills and plains But as deathless lord of London—king eternal and supreme Of the city where the gaslights on his countless armies gleam. There, it might be, I should find her. There for some two years I sought Vainly, vainly, ever vainly—hearing nothing, finding nought; Till at last, one evening, entering Charing Cross to catch the train I ran almost up against her—yes, her very self again. Yes, her very self unaltered—so at first I fondly dreamed: Nay, the light that through the dark eyes flashed and sparkled, shone and gleamed, Bright and lovely, was not lovely as it used to be of old; Now the gaze had grown self-conscious, it might be a trifle bold. Yet she seemed well pleased to see me and with tears the brown eyes filled (Ah, for just one rapturous moment all the storm of life seemed stilled!)— Then we moved away together, out of sound and sight of all; Much my heart fails to remember, but these wild words I recall:— “Yes, I always loved you dearly, but you would not understand, You were thinking of your preaching—you were sombre, and so grand! You were thinking of the next world—I was happy, quite, in this— And you dreamed of heavenly mansions, while I coveted a kiss. “You were wrong and I was right, love—I was ready, you were not; You were writing passion's novel but mismanaging the plot: Come with me—I want to show you that my life is glad and bright; I will love you, sad old lover, I will love you for a night. “I will love you—yes, for nothing—that I never did before; I will show you all my treasures, you shall be one conquest more: You look grave and you are solemn, but I know you love me well; When you travel back to Cornwall you shall have a tale to tell. “You shall see my diamond earrings, and my lovely china jars With such strange old pictures on them—one of Venus kissing Mars: You shall see my blue plush curtains and my ostrich-feather fans; All my room is like a dream, love,—fairer far than dream of man's. “Oh, you used to tell me stories of the fairies, what they did, In their palaces immortal or their leafy coverts hid; But my palace is the richer and my jewels are more grand Than the jewels of the fairies through the whole of fairy-land! “There are blossoms everlasting in my room, they never fade; It is merely a small question of the florist's man well paid: Did the fairies' blossoms glitter even in wintry hostile hours? That is nought; in mid-December I can gather hot-house flowers! “I have strawberries—yes, at Christmas—I have peaches when the moon Dreads her dreary five months' journey to the purple skies of June: I have everything I wish for; if I craved for one thing more I should surely in the morning find it set outside my door! “That is love, you know—to gratify a woman's every whim: That is better far than preaching of the saints and seraphim; Those old saints you used to preach of—how I pitied them poor things, Dragging o'er the heavenly hill-tops their gold harps and heavy wings! “I'm a saint too—some one thinks me quite a lovely perfect saint: If you knew how he adores me—and his stories are so quaint; Oh! the anecdotes he tells me—(let me whisper in your ear, He's a lord too—but be careful—not a soul must ever hear!) “There was never girl so perfect—and he says a perfect girl (Shall I trust you even further? yes, I'll tell you—he's an earl!) Ought to know all sorts of stories, ought to hear all kinds of things; Yes, I like him all the better for the funny books he brings. “There are goody-goody stories—there are novels of intrigue,— And I read the former yawning, but the last without fatigue; There are wonderful French novels, full of horrors—just like life— Where the good man dreams of heaven, while the bad man steals his wife. “I get up at twelve to breakfast, and I go to bed at two; That seems wonderful, old lover, and disgraceful—yes, to you. Down in Cornwall you don't labour like us Londoners at night: When the stars and weak moon fail us, we turn on the electric light. “But we're wasting time—step out now—I will show you where I live, And I'll give you one night's pleasure—that's a real big boon to give (All for love too, all for nothing) when the golden youth in town Pay a brougham for a smile, dear, and a bank-note for a frown! “For I frown upon them sometimes, and they love me just as well, Stuff their bank-notes in my pocket—then I laugh and come and tell My real darling, my brave lover, my kind ducky of an earl, That he's found a faithful mistress, quite a treasure of a girl. “Come, come quickly, for to-morrow—so he writes me—he'll return; There's one night, my friend, still left you—hasten—never look so stern! Why your whole glad face should brighten with a measureless content When a girl so tries to please you. You'll come with me?” And I went. Yes, my soul had been too eager; I had raised my hopes too high; I had dreamed of perfect goodness there beyond the starry sky: I had thought that over all things reigned a God supremely pure, That he stooped from heaven to help us—but my faith was premature. I had dreamed that by his Spirit every noble deed was wrought, That he bent from heaven inspiring every sweet unselfish thought, That he bade us seek his counsel and his grace to sanctify, Breathing round us ghostly comfort, ever watching, ever nigh. I had dreamed that all our sorrows could be used by him to teach Holy lessons worth man's learning, mysteries passing thought and speech; I had loved and I had worshipped—by the wintry Cornish foam I had dreamed of stormless havens, of a Father and a home. When before the grey-green breakers, plunging wildly through the waves, Fled the fishing-boats in winter, while the hoarse wind through the caves And the crags and coigns of granite swept with horror in its roar, I had dreamed of heavenly sunshine shed along a waveless shore. I had loved the bearded seamen—I had preached to them of peace On their tossing boats in winter, when the storm-trumps never cease: When the surges yearned to swallow man and boat within their graves I had told them how the Saviour closed the wild mouths of the waves. I had told them—and they listened, with stern faces very still— That the raging deep was subject to a Father's loving will; That the maddest wave was free not from its halter and its chain, Though it seemed to us unfettered as it coursed along the main. I had said, while all around us streamed the cataracts of the foam, “God is lord of the wild waters, and of all ye love at home; Here the waves' throats howl and raven, but on shore the storm is done, And your children gather blossoms on the cliffs beneath the sun. “There they pluck the golden trefoil, while our vessel sways and rocks, With its brave bows never swerving at the rude waves' countless shocks: There they gather the sea-poppies; God is guarding every one; Here he rules in mist and darkness, there he smiles within the sun. “Fathers, mothers, little children—he can shield you one and all; Aye, without his loving mandate not a sparrow's plume shall fall, No white feather of a sea-bird, till the course of time is run: God can lighten the sea's darkness, he is mightier than the sun.” I had comforted the widow, I had soothed the soul bereaved, I had sought to bring God's comfort to the spirit as it grieved; I had preached the eternal rapture of the life beyond the grave While in hearing of my hearers death's voice sobbed within the wave. In the little whitewashed chapel, with its hideous walls and pews, I had preached to eager hearers Christ's, the gospel's, great good news; I had preached of heavenly glories till the hearers' eyes grew dim, Aye, and preached of hell's red terrors with insistence stern and grim. I had said to the poor woman, when they brought her darling home With his yellow hair still dripping with the clammy beads of foam, “Christ has taken—yield him gently. Still your sweetheart with him waits Smiling, watching, tarrying for you, just behind the golden gates.” I had preached, and striven to comfort—now I knew it was a lie: Of all hopeless hearts and weary the most hopeless heart was I, The most hopeless and the weariest—I the preacher of the Lord, I who trusted in his mercy, had been smitten by his sword. I had preached of hell's red terrors—now my preaching all was done; 'Tis not hard to preach of darkness in the full light of the sun: Easy it is to tell hell's captives to break through their prison bars When oneself is steering heavenward in the full light of the stars! I had preached, but now I knew it, the eternity of pain; Heaven was lost, aye lost for ever, or there was no heaven to gain: Now I knew what I had dreamed of, what the godless void may be— Hell's fierce breakers stretching onward, and no Christ's foot on the sea. Yes, my noblest dreams were scattered. I had dreamed that God had sent Annie, my one love, my darling, my one priceless treasure lent By the Lord to me, to lift me—so I fancied—yet more near Ever unto him in spirit; a delusion—that was clear. Oh my darling whom I worshipped, whom I would have died to win In her pureness, her perfection, safe from weakness, stain, and sin; Whom my whole soul would have honoured, in her tender girlish bloom; Whom God gave me—for one moment—in a gaslit London room! Was it noble, was it worthy of the Lord of heaven to make Her my destined bride a harlot? was it godlike thus to take From a weary heart its gladness, from a lonely soul its light, When I lost her for a lifetime, having won her for a night? Just one night—aye, one night only—and one night in such a place! There to see her gazing at me with the same sweet girlish face Little hardened, scarcely altered, that I used to watch at home, While the moon outside the window lit the pure wild wastes of foam. She the same—yet not the same one—nevermore the same to me Who had held my hand in silence by the blue clear Cornish sea; Who as pure as heaven above us had beheld the stars arise Over sinless leagues of ocean, with love's starlight in her eyes. She the very same for ever—with the wealth of raven hair, Throat whose every curve was perfect, yes if anything more fair; Yet with something lost for ever—with one jewel on the track Dropped—and never through all ages shall we win that jewel back! She the same in sinful London—she, with girlish eyes and heart, Now a sinner, yes a sinner—just a portion, just a part Of the wanton selfish city, she who might have been my own; Now all London stood between us—we should never be alone! I had preached of Christ's redemption. Could his rich blood wash out this? Could he undo what had happened, and unfasten kiss from kiss? Could he link by link remove it, sin's once-fashioned deadly chain? Set before me my lost darling in her whiteness once again? Could he take the feeling from me—though I found her very fair— That another hand before me had caressed the raven hair? That malignant haunting horror, of all poisonous pangs the worst, That each touch had been discounted, that each kiss had been rehearsed! Such a bridal—such a bride-bed—with the drama played before And the author's step, it might be, even now close at the door: Such a bride and such a marriage—just one hour love in the room, Love's voice singing for one moment, then the silence of the tomb! Singing—ah! and such a song too—not the song sung by the sea When the envious throstle clamoured for the copyright from me: When the gold sun paused to listen, though but half his toil was done; When the sun forgot the cornfields, and the lark forgot the sun. This was something like the cadence—still I carry it in my brain: How the words light up those cornfields with the sun's old glory again! How the words, though sweet and simple, sum the history up in brief, For a covert threat lurks in them and a prophecy of grief! The blue sea brings its greeting to the swallow, Then drives it inland with the wild sea-storm. The fields are crowned with bloom, but cold winds follow: Hardly the flowers can keep each other warm. The sun cries to the sky, “Soon must we part: I love you—yes—but not with all my heart!” “We love you, yes, but with a love most fleeting,” So cry the stars to the eternal night: “Farewell! farewell! the sun awaits our greeting; We loved the darkness, now we love the light. Farewell! farewell! the tenderest souls must part: 'Tis good to love—but not with all the heart.” “I love you!” cries the vessel to the river: I love your ripples and their harmless glee; Yet one day with delicious shock and shiver My bows will meet the white waves of the sea. I love you, river, yet we needs must part: I love you well—but not with all my heart.” “I love you!” cries the sea's voice to the vessel, “But I have loved a thousand loves before Then flung them, after one wild amorous wrestle, Pale and discarded on the loveless shore. New loves await me, when the old loves depart: My locks are grey, but youth is in my heart.” Then her ringing clear voice deepened though the song more cruel grew; Still I carry it in my memory, for the cadence thrilled me through: Ah! how well the song expressed her—all her soul through the refrain Chimed out silver-sweet and girlish, yet so careless of man's pain. “I love you, friend—I love you, strong and tender, And full of care for me and kindly thought: I love the summer morning's golden splendour, The frosty lacework on our windows wrought: And yet I love not wholly, only in part; All things I love—yet not with all my heart. “There is a something still before me waiting; I stand and tremble on the wave-washed shore: I stand in doubt, uncertain, hesitating; Love it may be has lovelier gifts in store. Love only as yet has given himself in part: Me Love has loved, but not with all his heart! “If with your heart you love me, let the swallow Point out the road to other shores than ours: I am a bird of passage—I would follow The blue-winged birds to lands of gayer flowers. They tarry not—they love us, yet depart; And I would follow them with all my heart. “I love you well, but yet the hours are flying; The summers pass us by—they gaze in scorn: Yes, hour by hour the golden days are dying; Life dies, while pleasure hardly yet is born. Oh give your bright-winged bird leave to depart, And I will love you then with all my heart. Where she found the song, I know not—nor if here and there a word She had altered, lightly singing, like the light heart of a bird: In some book maybe she found it; he who wrote it knew not then That on one heart 'twould be written with a dagger, not a pen. I would leave the accursed city—I would take her child with me, So she begged me, so she wished it—I would seek the old pure sea: There by stainless wastes of water, by blue wavelets undefiled, It might be a fairer future might await the sinless child. It was something—just a little—for the lost sad mother's sake That I still might do—a little—so my heart not quite might break; Break not yet at least,—my life's work not as yet was wholly done; I had yet to preach of darkness, I the prophet of the sun. How my thoughts flew back remembering how some fifteen years before I had borne away the mother, then a child, and left the door Of the hospital in London thanking God that I could give To a dying woman comfort—then it seemed worth while to live! Annie—little dark-eyed darling—how I proudly bore you away! How I showed you to my mother! how I watched you at your play! How I bought you dolls and trinkets, and a hundred wondrous toys, And tin soldiers—till my mother said that soldiers were for boys. When the railway journey ended, the long journey to Penzance, How I watched your bright eyes sparkle, when you saw the white waves dance: How I thought, “There yet is sunlight, if all other sunlight dies; This is God's eternal sunlight—even the light in sinless eyes!” Oh, how well I can remember when the sea flashed on your sight How you stretched your eyes wide open, with a laugh of pure delight; How with that same voice which, later, made the throstle's heart despond With an eager gasp you asked me, “Are there ducks upon that pond?” How you loved to gather sea-weed—red and green and white and pink; I can see to-day your shudder—I can see your fingers shrink At their sudden startling contact with that cold flower of the sea, The bright scarlet turquoise-beaded furtive sea-anemone. With what pride—I can remember—you once brought me in your hand A translucent lovely treasure which the sea had tossed on land; Just a piece of broken bottle—but to us it seemed to be Surely a priceless emerald stolen from the fairies of the sea! Then the terror—oh! the terror—when beneath that granite slab Your poor finger came in contact, cruel contact, with a crab; How I kissed the poor pinched finger—how I soothed your sobs and sighs— And we bore the rude crab homeward in a teacup for a prize. Then the rapture, the wild rapture, when we saw the goby gleam In our net at last, a captive—the fulfilment of a dream That had lasted the whole summer, for that summer's dearest wish Was to capture from his rock-pool that swift-darting tiny fish. Then the glories of the shore too—there were butterflies on land, Fair to see, but hard to capture. Once you brought me in your hand (Now a hundred bright wing-cases count for nothing on your fan) Such a prize—a great rose-beetle—splendid past the speech of man! Has one jewel in London glittered with as fairylike a gleam As the spots upon the trout's side which we jerked from out the stream, Making all the alder-bushes—and our clothes too—wringing wet, With a happy sudden side-jerk of the diamond-dropping net? Oh those were our golden moments, though more golden were to come When I read you in the quiet and the silence of our home Tales of giants, dwarfs, and ogres, tales of knights and ladies fair —Thinking all the time “no lady ever had my Annie's hair!” How you loved the marvellous stories—nothing as you older grew Was too marvellous, too fantastic, too miraculous for you: Yes—I sometimes even think that our old readings' very charm Turned your mind from life's real duties, did your dawning spirit harm. Take for instance that grand story which would move you even to tears Of the wondrous Fairy Palace which no mortal footstep nears, Magic Palace of the Seasons where the seasons four are one, Where the white snow gleams for ever, yet it melts not at the sun. How your fancy seized the notion of the mingled seasons there, Of the scents of summer mixing with the snow-flakes in the air, Of the measureless bright Palace where eternal summer gleamed, Where the nightingale for ever sang and loved, and loved and dreamed. How you revelled in the notion of the fragrant summer room Where for ever all the roses of the fay-land were in bloom: Where the leafage of a summer that no mortal might behold Lit the deep trees with a splendour mortal tongue has never told. Summer—yes, eternal summer—in that fragrant central room Nought of darkness, nought of horror, nought of sorrow, nought of gloom: That is how your life, my darling (so I murmured!) ought to be; Perfect happiness proceeding from unsullied purity. But the Palace—the bright Palace—oh! my fancy lingers there; If a mortal could but find it, and could breathe its sinless air— If again we could but find it, how contented we should be Even its solemn winter chamber, not the summer room, to see! For within the winter chamber endless hoary winter reigned; Whitest snows of earthly mountains would seem muddy, blurred and stained, By the pure unsullied whiteness of the eternal snows within That far-off enchanted Palace, where no heart had dreamed of sin. Yes, the keen eyes of the fairies might with reason view with scorn Even the bluest ice that glitters on our lordly Matterhorn: Not from noblest Alpine summit was there ever view so grand As from even the humblest summit of the hills of fairy-land. And the night, the wondrous night there, when upon the peaks sublime Fell a silence, such a silence; on the shadowy hills of time That our Wordsworth made immortal, when the moon breathed down her spell And the stars shed forth their glamour, never such a silence fell: Silence perfect, strange, unearthly—silence as of utmost peace— Such as when the trumpet clamours of the warring wild winds cease On a sudden in mid-ocean, and the sea with gentle lips Whispers, “I was only playing,” to the sea-birds and the ships: Silent peace—I used to fancy—such as Jesus might have known When he murmured “It is finished,” when he stood at last alone Face to face with labour ended; peace no mortal sorrow mars: Such the calm was when those ice-peaks glittered underneath the stars! Sinless calm and peace most holy, so the dear old fable ran, Brooded o'er those stainless summits never soiled by foot of man: Calm divine and rapture perfect—through the crags no thunder rolled; There the sun rose storm-defiant, there he sank in cloudless gold. That was far too grand for mortals—we could breathe with easier breath In that Palace of the Seasons where life mocks the sword of death When we entered the bright chamber where rich autumn reigned superb, Crowned with fiery leaves and sunshine, and with glowing corn and herb. (That was just what took your fancy—to have all good gifts in one— Noble whiteness of the winter, nobler glory of the sun; Spring's soft colours never dreading, with a pang of sudden grief, Death that turns the green leaf living to the golden dying leaf.) For within the fairy palace the rich woods of autumn shone, Forest after forest flaming into distances unknown: No such colours in the far-famed Indian summer of the West Ever burned on leafy banners, ever flashed from leafy crest. Fairy oaks and fairy beeches, scarlet maples, glittered there And such radiance gleamed along them from the magic heights of air That, had mortal vision seen them, mortal tongue could never tell How the tossing waves of colour on the light wind rose and fell. Even here was contradiction. What would fairy landscapes be Without wizard feats of colour, glorious incongruity? There were roses, there were snow-drifts, there were yellow autumn leaves— There were dahlias by the ice-ponds, there was frost upon the sheaves. But the loveliest of the chambers in the Palace was the one Where the green leaves gave a softness to the full flame of the sun: Where the may-bloom ever glistened, but more fragrant far than ours; Where the children of the fairies gathered never-dying flowers. There was spring-time everlasting—not a spring that fades away Leaving littered in the foot-paths trodden blossoms of the may, Not a spring that shrinks from summer, but a spring that still will last When the earthly flowers and foliage of a million springs are past. You with sunlight in your glances, and with spring-time in your heart, Seemed yet fuller fairer meaning to the story to impart: When the fairy queen came singing through her palace, every word Seemed to suit you, to express you—it was Annie that I heard. Ours is the unfading pleasure That never can grow old; A joy beyond man's measure, Delight no tongue has told. No death within our palace For ever will there be,— No wild storm's wrath or malice, No terror of the sea. If man with all his sorrow Could reach us where we dwell There would be no to-morrow For fairy mount or fell; If man with all his sadness Within our gates could stand There would be no more gladness Then left for fairy-land. For man would bring his yearning, His hopes and fears and sighs, His passions fierce and burning, His feverish enterprise:— We post our keen-eyed warders Along the frontier line; Upon the magic borders Their fairy sabres shine. If man could ever enter The fairy-land, what grief Would thrill its very centre, A horror past belief. For all our flowers are stainless And all our fields are fair: The life we live is painless, But man's life means despair. Never the fairy warders Will let one mortal pass: Imperative their orders— Were they to yield alas! What thunderous change of weather Upon our hills would loom, For man and sin together Would bring about our doom. But man with heart infernal Will never trespass here; His sentence is eternal, His destiny is clear: He sees the golden portal Through silent slumber gleam,— He cries “I am immortal!” He wakes—It is a dream. I was dreaming of the Palace—I was in the railway train Bearing Annie, ever Annie, to the old lost home again: I was dreaming of the fairies, but my fairy queen was gone; I was only alas! a mortal, broken-hearted and alone. No, the pure-eyed child was with me, with her hand within my hand, Just a stray gold blossom-petal drifted here from fairy-land! But the mother, my lost fairy—she would never, nevermore, See the fairy legions mustering all along the mystic shore! She would never hear the bugles of the fairy squadrons sound, See the fairies line the frontier, guard the old enchanted ground: She would never see the gateways at her coming open wide And the fairy guards saluting, straight, erect, on either side. Day by day the guards would wonder that her chariot never rolled, Drawn by milk-white noble prancers, through the glittering gates of gold: Day by day the keen-eyed watchers, peering out, would peer in vain; Never trumpet in the distance! never dust upon the plain! There the guards will wait for ever—there the sentinels will stand— All will still go on for ever as of old in fairy-land: As of old, with one thing wanting—not at evening nor at morn Through the gates with shouts of triumph will the fairy queen be borne. Though the fairy soldiers know not, though the sinless peaks of snow In the wondrous winter chamber smiling on the meads below, Though these know not, I could tell them where their mourned-for mistress dwells— In a land remote for ever from their stormless fields and fells. Well the years sped on in Cornwall, but I'll pass those swift years by; Nothing varied the vast calmness of the expanse of sea and sky. All the love in me was softened into fatherhood again: Ah, the love in man enables Fate to inflict the endless pain! All went on in steady sequence—that is how the days depart When Fate lurks behind the sunshine with new dark deeds in his heart: Just the same they seem to pass us, smiling, sun-kissed, every one; But Fate, black-browed, thunder-wielding, stands alert behind the sun. —So in summer when the ocean with its soft voice to the land Sings its love-song, sings so gently, he whose heart can understand, Versed in all the ways of Nature, still within the sound can hear Something of its wintry storm-voice, when its wild wrath stuns the ear. For the one same sea in summer to the listening sunlit shore Says with voice as of a lover, “Lo, I love you, I adore!” And in winter to the cliff-sides, ribbed with granite though they be, “Lo, I hate you—ye shall perish from the pathway of the sea!” Fate arose at last: a letter in the old handwriting came— How the light of coming evil flashed across my eyes like flame! Half I broke it open—waited—tore the envelope once more— Trembled then again and waited—till I read it on the shore. She was dying, said the letter, dying in London all alone— Would I come once more and see her? (Would a mother leave her own?) So once more I journeyed townward, took the route I knew so well; Left the quiet sea behind me, entered London—entered hell. Not the same as when I left it was the once well-furnished room: All to-day was desolation, all was emptiness and gloom. No silk curtains to the bed-posts, not a picture now was there; Just a bed—a dying woman—a white ghost with raven hair! Yes, the fairy guards were waiting, far away in fairy-land, But the fairy queen lay dying in a bed-room off the Strand. Not again in fairy regions would her golden sceptre wave: She was just a poor lost woman, five days' journey from her grave! He had left her in man's fashion, wearied when the prize was gained: Of the wedding-robes of passion not a worn-out shred remained! —Left her all alone in London, with the one vile bitter word “Earn your living, you are young yet;” was there any Christ who heard? Was there any Christ, I wonder, who had seen the whole thing done, Seen the girl's heart grow to woman's, seen the woman lightly won, Watched at night within the bed-room, seen the man come, then depart, Any Christ—we'll grant his godhead—but with manhood in his heart? Was there any Christ who knew it, all the lies the man had told, All the lying talk of marriage—who had seen the ring of gold, Just the saddest of all tokens, worn to shirk the social ban, Worn to link her to her sisters, not to link her to the man? Was there any Christ who knew it and whose pure true heart contained All a strong man's mightiest passion, all a strong God's anger chained? Any Christ whose deep love blended in its vast and complex whole All the pity in man's deep nature, all the love in woman's soul? Was his pity quite exhausted? Was his healing power outworn? Did he wear just for one season one ephemeral crown of thorn? In Jerusalem he triumphed? When he rose from out the grave Did he deem his work was over, that no souls were left to save? Did he deem when man betrayed him that no Judas would arise In the ages that he saw not, under Western sunless skies? Did his soul foresee the horror that the years to come would bring? Was he only for one moment just a pale apparent King? Was his kingship wholly vested in the moments that he spent Here on earth with men and women, ere the Temple's veil was rent? Could he face the sin of London? Could he see our streets by night Yet retain his stormless splendour, and his crown's imperial light? Could he bear to see our city—could he know the evil done Every hour, yes every moment, when the gaslights drown the sun? Every night some woman ruined, every night some base seeds sown For whose harvests of fierce evil not God's whole blood could atone! Had he seen this woman ruined? Had he followed Annie's life? Would he not now track the villain, hunt him down with dagger or knife? Would he not proclaim God's justice—if a God indeed there be— God's eternal hate of evil, God's unsullied majesty? —So the thoughts in swift wild sequence flew with frenzy through my brain As I saw the dying woman, heard her speak yet once again, Heard her tell with broken accents all her story of despair; Then my whole soul cried out Godward as I watched her lying there, Cried out heavenward: “If the mountains or the lurid storm-clouds hold Any strong God, a Jehovah, as the peoples deemed of old, If there be a God of anger, past the anger of the sea, And behind the love of Jesus, noble wrath's intensity; “If there be within the thunder still a living God more strong, If the lightning's sword be his sword, if his soul detests the wrong, If the righteous power of judgment yet within some God remains, If he be not blind for ever, if his sceptre he retains; “If he be not weak or slothful, be not sunk in lethargy, Let him mark this London death-bed, let him gaze from heaven and see: Let him stay no longer dallying with his minor toils on high, Let him stoop to us in London, let him quit the starry sky; “Let him rise up in his anger—as they say of old he rose— Let his sword leap from the scabbard, on the hilt his fingers close; Let him carry out my curse now, carry it out by day, by night, Let the living God do justice, let the Lord God hear and smite; “Let the living God do justice, let the living God proclaim Once again his deathless glory, and the greatness of his name; Let him follow with his vengeance this one man, where'er he be— Let my soul's curse light upon him, let it traverse land and sea; “If he scale the lofty mountains, let my curse, God, still be there; Let it peal within the thunder, let it sound through sunlit air; Let it follow him all his lifetime, let it ring his earthly knell, Let it follow him to the graveyard, let it haunt his steps in hell.” Then my whole soul changed to pity. Now the storm of wrath was dead: Very tenderly I raised her, and I kissed the raven head, Kissed it gently, oh so gently—and I kissed the pale sad brow, Thinking, “Though past words I loved her, yet I never loved till now!” All the fieriest early passion had not half the strength or power Of the sense of deathless pity that transfused my soul that hour; I was conscious now of nothing save a love so deep, so strong, That the sense of horror vanished, and the deadly sense of wrong. Here was death to make atonement for the vast wrong done to me: Here was sin's whole end, commencement of a pure eternity. Sin had done its violent utmost to degrade and to defile; Life had strangled her young laughter—death had given her back her smile. Yes, her smile—for as she lay there such a sweetness through her eyes Came with lovely radiance gleaming as through stormiest sunset skies When an autumn wild day closes and the sullen vapours part And we know the sun is living and that love lives at his heart. Just the very same old sweetness, only sweeter so it seemed, That I worshipped when that sunset on the far-off cliff-sides gleamed— When she gave the waves their laughter, gave its lustre to the sky, Gave the evening star its splendour, even her girlish purity. Then I thought, “Whatever happens in the land to which she goes, Whether life or love be waiting, or profound and sweet repose, One thing surely is not waiting, surely it is not in God's plan When the grave's past to confront her with the lies and lust of man. “Whether angels group around her, or the friends of former years, Some with outstretched hands of welcome, some with grave eyes full of tears, Whether Jesus there be waiting, this at least I know right well, That the villain who betrayed her will be leagues away in hell. “God will turn hell's keys upon him, God will keep him safe within The dark region he exults in, even the land of lust and sin: If in God's heart or in Christ's heart any noble anger be The destroyer is damned for ever, but the victim shall go free!” Then she signed to me to listen, and I stooped above the bed: “I know better now, forgive me,” with the same sweet voice she said, Yes the same, but sadly weak now, that had won my heart of old; Then she grasped my hand so firmly in a tight strange childlike hold— “Guard my darling, guard my daughter, save her from this world of sin; There's another Annie left you, there's a victory left to win: If you see her heart misguided, if you see her going wrong, Kill her...kill her—that way save her—you can save, if you are strong. “If you see her copy her mother, if you see her growing too like, Be more merciful than God is, call on pure-souled death to strike! Swear to me, whatever happens, you will never let her be Any rich man's sport and plaything, never let her grow like me. “Do not speak to her of her mother—or, if you must speak at all, Only speak of early days, dear, long before the mother's fall: If she wants to know my ending, asks you what became of me, Say my death was strange and lonely...say that I was drowned at sea.... “Don't forget me, for I loved you—though I did not know it then— You were grave and I light-hearted, and I could not fathom men: When they told me that they loved me, I believed it, till I knew That the grave love was the true love—till at last I fathomed you. “Till at last I understood, dear, wholly learned and not in part How my folly had made you suffer, how my sin had wrecked your heart: Yes, at last I understood you, but the knowledge came in vain; Now it could not bring atonement—it could only deepen pain. “Why, I wonder, is it—always—that a woman's soul must win Perfect knowledge of what love is through the trial first of sin? Perfect knowledge of the noblest through experience of the worst? When she's on the road to Jesus, why must Judas win her first? “Ah! I cannot understand it—nothing now to me is clear Save this one thing, that I love you and I like to feel you near: Come yet closer, come quite close now, for I cannot see you well; Tell me, is God very angry? will he send my soul to hell? “I don't fear him—I can face him, if there's love within his mind; If he loves me as you love me, he will never be unkind: If he loves me as you love me, I could love him in the end; And the next world seems so lonely—I want some one for a friend! “Shall I have to be alone there? I was frightened long ago In that dark strange cave in Cornwall—when I went alone, you know, Seeking ferns within the cavern. When you found me, all was right, For the sunshine came in with you, and that gloomy cave grew bright. “Put your hand beneath the pillow—I have still some seaweed there, Dried, in that small sealed-up packet, and a tuft of maiden-hair That we gathered—you've forgotten?—in remembrance of the cave And my grand deliverance from it: I should like them in my grave. “They may serve there to remind me—who can tell us?—it may be— That you saved me from that darkness and the hoarse threats of the sea: They may serve to give me hope there”—then the voice failed—then she said, “It is dark again, dear—kiss me...” as I kissed her she was dead. Soon I passed into the darkness of the quiet street outside, Just to seek the last sad tendance for a woman who had died; That was all in outward seeming—just to send a human frame Living help in its last journey to the dust from whence it came. That was all in outward seeming: as I turned into the Strand What a rage and crush of people, what a crowd on either hand! Life was hurrying on for ever in its immemorial stream; Which was truth, my whole soul wondered—which, I wondered, was the dream? Which was life in very truth now, which was after all most sweet? Were they living, these lost women, as they pressed along the street, Coarse, with coarser men companions—were they living, or was she Rather living? Had the dead soul won life's genuine victory? “Where is right and where is justice? All is accident and chance. As I passed just now that woman I saw deep within her glance All the latent power of loving that in happier sisters leads Their own souls to heights of virtue, those they love to noble deeds. “Must one woman be degraded, while another woman soars Clad in rustling silks and satin towards the heavenly golden doors? Why must all the stars, obsequious, lend one honeymoon their light While another woman in darkness changes husbands every night? “Why must one display with rapture, happy, wifely, pure and sweet, All her gifts and wedding presents, with the whole world at her feet, While another, just as noble, had her life's chance been the same, Dips her soul each night more deeply in the nameless mire of shame? “Why must one parade in Venice, with her husband by her side, While another walks in London, all the town's promiscuous bride? Analyse them when they started, eyes and lips and mind and heart— It may be you'd hardly have known them, after all, at first, apart? “Why must one child in the cradle by a mother rocked to sleep Rest, while through the foggy darkness other weary footsteps creep,— Weary footsteps of some mother, in her madness carrying down Her first baby to the river, for the cradling waves to drown?” So I thought, and through my spirit a wild sense of godship ran, But a godship fierce, nefarious, not a godship good for man. I had grown in strength of being, but my faith in God was gone: I was standing silent, self-poised—loving truth and that alone. As I watched the crowded pavement and the sad lost faces there All my soul was rent and tortured by a measureless despair; Yet a living force within me seemed to meet the sense of wrong, Living, holy, deathless, godlike, inextinguishably strong. “Death is peace and life is anguish; death's the end, the perfect goal;” This I'll preach in tones of triumph to each listening suffering soul: I shall win, maybe, more hearers—talk of joy, you seem to jest!— But all mortal souls have suffered, and all sufferers long for rest. “Other souls have loved before you, they have suffered, they have passed: Now they call you from the sea-waves, now they summon from the blast. Through a thousand storms they wrestled, through all stormy days but one— That day bore them, wild with rapture, down to darkness from the sun. “And our hope is just to join them, those old ancestors of ours, Stalwart ghosts of brave old Vikings in the deep sea's crystal bowers; There they wait, the staunch old Norsemen—we shall join them, we shall be Welcomed with a shout of triumph through the gateways of the sea. “Though a million ships have safely sailed along the ocean way Little heeded by the waters, not caressed of wind or spray, Yet a chance is left for each one, for the ocean's heart is large; ‘Still it loves you’ the wind whispers, as it sings along its marge. “Still the mighty ocean loves you—yes, the ocean's heart is grand. Has life failed to apprehend you? Still the sea can understand. Are you weary of the pleasures and the loves of every day? There's a kiss fatigueless waiting on the white lips of the spray! “Not in quiet gardens lighted by the soft light of the sun, Nor in heavenly golden palace, shall your final bliss be won; Nay, beneath a stormier moonlight than the light that filled the sky When the sea to the Armada spake one sweet wild hoarse word: ‘Die!’ “Sweet and wild and hoarse and loving—life was waiting them in Spain, Life with all its feeble pleasures, its vast loss, its little gain; Then the infinite sea had mercy—while it baulked the Spaniards' plan, To its bosom's cold pure sweetness it clasped every vessel and man.” So I preached awhile in London, and I found that I could win Hearers—not perhaps save sinners from the ways of wrath and sin As I once (I thought) could save them; now I saved them by the cry “Life is failure, life is torture—lay firm hold on death, and die!” Yes, I found I reached the people: they were ripe and ready there In dark cruel evil London for the gospel of despair. Many sufferers crowded round me, and I gave them of my best; Even the hope of rest from suffering, deep unconscious painless rest. But I wearied of the city, and I longed to hear once more The old angry white waves beating on the stedfast Cornish shore; Longed to see how time was dealing with the bright-eyed girl to whom Life was still a fairy palace, not a dungeon or a tomb. So I came, and when I saw her lo! the budding rose had blown; While I toiled and preached in London, the swift sunny days had flown Down in Cornwall: very lovely was the Annie whom I saw— Yet a thrill of pain ran through me, and I watched her half in awe. She had grown so like her mother! all the past came storming back; Far away my mind went roaming on the old sad trodden track: I was busy while in London—here my mind was void and free, Open to the wind's weird whisper, and the wild voice of the sea. Is there one pure maid, one virgin, in this universe at all? Did not all fair women totter at the first fair woman's fall? —Pure she seems and very tender on the sacred nuptial night, Yet in ages past with passion the same eyes, maybe, waxed bright. Is there one sure sign to show you that she has not lived before, Watched the sunlit blue waves rippling on some quiet Eastern shore? Here i' the North to-day she loves you. Yet her eyes, it may be, gleamed Ages since with Southern passion, as in ancient Rome she dreamed. Your fair bride, maybe, was harlot in some Babylonian street: Many ages she has traversed, and her lips were always sweet And her laugh was always tender—she was dark-eyed, even the same, When the towers of Carthage reddened into violent spires of flame. You to-day may deem you hold her. Not one soul is ever held Safe, securely, by another! By love's laws we are compelled On from passion unto passion, on from wild hope to despair: Maybe through a thousand ages she will still be here and fair. Virgin!—let the weak dream perish, for God laughs the dream to scorn. Is one life of any moment, is it of value to be born Pure just for one single lifetime? Every woman pure to-day In some past life has been wanton, and has flung her soul away. Flung her soul away—as Annie now will fling away her soul, For I see the horror coming, past a man's or God's control; Clearly I feel the horror coming—in her beauty and her pride She will pass into the darkness, like her mother, my lost bride. Surely soon her fate will seize her, for last week I saw her play With a diamond on her finger—when I tore the ring away Such a fierceness flashed upon me from her eyes that it was plain Here was just the mother's nature, reproduced on earth again. Reproduced—for good or evil? Could I doubt which when she said, “I would sell my soul for diamonds”—(how I thought of some one dead! How a desolate room in London flashed upon my sight once more! How I seemed to see men carry a black coffin from the door!) Lovely is she, very lovely, and the donor of the ring Doubtless covets her young beauty, full of sweetness as of spring: Doubtless, eager to possess her, he who gave the child the toy Will proceed—in man's sure manner—first to flatter, then destroy. All the horror will return then. Must I live to see her sink Down hell's fiery seething centre, after gathering on the brink Tender blossoms many-scented, flowers she finds exceeding fair? Must the old mad pain redouble and the speechless old despair? Doubtless all her heart is changing—as her mother's changed before; Now she hears no simple music in the waves' beat on the shore: Now her longing when she watches the moon soar across the sky Is the longing to escape us, and to revel in liberty! Doubtless she too dreams of passion, when we think she dreams of prayer: When her form is in the chapel, her swift spirit is not there; It is far away with some one—who can hold her or retain? God can chain the winged wild ocean, but a girl he cannot chain. Neither man nor God can chain her, nor can strong life hold her fast: Only death can ever hold her, when life's efforts all are past. When life fails and when the Lord fails, man and death may sometimes win; When the sun fails, then the darkness puts an end to love and sin. The eternal darkness closes, and the woman no more sees Silvery moonlight on the waters, golden sunlight on the trees: The eternal darkness saves her, whom nor God nor man could save. Was she wanton on the green earth? She is chaste within the grave. Therefore seeing ever clearlier that the time has come at last For one frail man's giant protest, I have summoned up the past —I have written, since I saw the fatal ring upon her hand, Plainly all our strange sad story, that the world may understand. In the long week since I saw it, that clear token of our doom, I have relived all the stages, seen the sunlight, felt the gloom, Every scene and every trifle have endeavoured to recall. I alone knew all the sorrow. Now the world shall know it all. I will leave the story written, signed and sealed, within my desk, Then will rise up fierce for action, calm no longer, statuesque Now no longer—not a statue, but a living breathing frame Wild for wrestle with the Author of the sin, the woe, the shame. Even now I feel within me strange swift heart-throbs of relief, Somewhat even of exultation, triumph born of deadliest grief; Even now I see before me as it were with prophet's glance All the future made the present, known, experienced, in advance. I will steer into the Atlantic: Fate has wrecked and ruined me— I will form a last alliance with the thunder of the sea. Heaven has failed, aye God has failed me—Christ has failed me in my need; But the sea's heart still is left me, with the sea's heart I will plead. I will steer into the sunset: as that sunset years ago Bathed the world for me and Annie in its loving golden glow, As that sunset flashed before us with the radiance of a dream, Now another spotless sunset shall deliver and redeem. For this girl—another Annie—now another sunset waits: Yea, the sunset shall receive her in its fiery golden gates. All the fairy guards are waiting, far behind the walls of flame; For long years they have been waiting for their queen who never came. But their pure queen now is coming; let the fairy bugles blow! Let the fairies line the roadway! let the news fly to and fro! Let there be a stir, a bustle, through the fairies' wide domain, For the queen they've lost for ages is returning home again. Stately, noble, pure and queenly, full of girlish grace and charm, With God's genius as a sculptor shown in curve of throat and arm, With God's holier sense of sweetness in her maiden heart made known, She is coming, she for ever is returning to her own. She, returning, will be with us now for evermore, and bring As the golden gates she enters such a sudden sense of spring As on earth we feel when Winter with one foot yet on the wold Starts and trembles, as the furze-shoots flash their sudden spears of gold. She, returning, will be with us—lo! the golden sunset waits: She will enter far within it, far beyond the golden gates. She will traverse the old region, she its everlasting queen, With a sovereignty of splendour never witnessed in her mien. With a sovereignty of sweetness now within the queenly eyes She will traverse the old region, see the mountain land that lies Far beyond the fairy borders, which no eye of man has seen,— She the eternal perfect ruler, she the eternal sinless queen. Once again the golden sunset—once again, then never more— Shall flash out with heaven's own brilliance all along the Cornish shore. Here, where Tristram at Tintagel sinned with Iseult at his side, To the sunset, to the Atlantic, I will bring a sinless bride. Here, where Arthur's endless vigil of wild sorrow was begun, I will end all mortal sorrow; it shall set as sets the sun. It shall vanish in the sunset, it shall vanish in the sea; It shall vanish in the radiance of the sky's immensity. What the Lord God failed in doing when he placed upon the hand Of the world her ring of wedding, and espoused the sea and land, I a mortal, I so erring, will accomplish by my might: I will end the pain of living, pain shall vanish in a night. Pain shall vanish—for, a mortal, I can show the immortal road That not even Christ's brave footstep in its fullest grandeur showed: I can add to Jesus' gospel; I can follow where he went; I can bring on earth the silence of a measureless content. I can take this woman holding as it were within her womb A vast power of sorrow endless, endless summers' dying bloom, Endless souls unhinged by anguish, boundless agonies to be,— I can plunge the mortal mother in the vast womb of the sea. I can stay a million curses and avert a million pangs: Grief, men fancied, was immortal—I can blunt grief's deadly fangs. Men will follow where I lead them: I will lead them to the deep, To the sea of vast oblivion, to the shores of endless sleep. There all sorrow shall be ended, and the whole race shall atone For the crime of its creation and revert without a groan, Nay with one wild hymn of triumph, to the unconscious ecstasy Of the fields no ploughshare furrows and the unfurrowed shipless sea. That was joy and life unfailing, free from conscious life's despair; Then the pale moon swam in silence through the sorrowless blue air: Then the soul that gazes downward from the red depths of the sun Watched the earth, yet saw no evil, for no human deed was done. That was rapture for creation! then the golden lonely stars Tilted not with rays immortal at our mortal prison bars: Then they saw no prisoner dying on his silent couch,—they heard Neither battle's shout of triumph nor the lover's whispered word. Love was waiting to destroy us,—but love had not dawned on earth. All the sea laughed out unconscious, through its voice rang thoughtless mirth: Not the mirth it caught from Venus when she sprang from waves that smiled; Not the laughter of the lover, but the laughter of the child. Love was waiting to destroy us,—but as yet the world was free. Lovers loved not on the ocean for no ships sailed on the sea: Lovers loved not in the forests, and the lone hills watched the moon Trodden not by feet of lovers; loveless were the fields of June. That was peace and pleasure perfect; that great peace I will restore. Love shall vanish from the mountains, love shall die out on the shore. I, the preacher of the gospel of despair and boundless gloom, Will restore the world its silence, and its empire to the tomb. Men shall follow my example: step by step the world will cease To run madly after pleasure, and will long alone for peace. Then the cornfields will be weed-grown: who will care to reap the corn When man views himself with hatred and the whole of life with scorn? Man shall wreak at last his vengeance—as I wreak my vengeance, I, Steering out into the darkness, for the sun has left the sky; Bearing with me this one woman—would Fate lower her and deprave? Her at least he shall not conquer—her at least my hand shall save. Though I could not save the mother, is not she the mother now, With the same young strange pure sweetness in the eyes and on the brow? All the long sad years have vanished—Lo! love rises from its grave: I may save from black pollution her I would have died to save. Not in London shall she perish: now our bridal couch shall be Pure and sweet and holy and stainless, even the holy and stainless sea. She whom once I loved in London, where I loved her for an hour, Shall be mine in love immortal, far beyond Fate's lurid power. This is nobler, this ends better than the sad old tale began; This is worthier of my passion, this is worthier of a man. Now the tender night is coming, and the stars will light our way To the room where death is bridegroom, not the room where once we lay. I am death her perfect bridegroom, we are on the lonely deep: Now the night eternal waits us, we have many an hour for sleep; Sweet long hours for sleep, my darling—there's no footstep at the door! Nay, the winds and waves shall guard us, we are many a league from shore. We are lonely at last together, we have left the adulterous land: Lo! our solemn marriage-chamber, lo! our spotless couch at hand. You and I are all alone, love—mortal sounds have died away; Hear the stars' song to the ocean! hear the wind's voice to the spray! Lest our deep calm should be troubled, lest our marriage should be marred, God has sent the unnumbered armies of the deathless stars to guard: That our rapture may be endless and our souls past waking one He has darkened earth for ever, he has slain the intrusive sun. Lest I find you all too lovely, he has sent the moon to show With her soft light for the first time your uncovered breast of snow: Lest I scorn all flowers for ever when your first kiss startles me, He has left the flowers on land, love—he has set us on the sea. Lest the roses all be envious, he has made your mouth a rose; He has left a thousand blossoms on the cliff-sides in repose, He has given ephemeral fragrance to the flowers, ephemeral bliss, He will make the rose eternal in the sweetness of your kiss. Lest the thought of an invasion of our joy should e'er intrude, Any thought of old dead cities, he has given us solitude: Lest a dream of other beings should bring sadness to your face, He has ended other life, love, he has slain the human race. He has had at last great mercy, he has given us bliss divine, Perfect death for you and me, love—life in death, for you are mine. Ours will be the last embrace, love: on this white-waved ocean-plain One last rapture superhuman shall end superhuman pain. All the rapture of the passion that from Eve's first soft kiss ran Like a torrent, like a fire-flood, through the throbbing veins of man, All the raptures of old history, shall be gathered into ours, As the rose resumes the fragrance of a million nameless flowers. That is mightiest compensation—thus to loose within our veins The full torrent of past passion, and to fix the past in chains: Thus to bind the world for ever, but to set two lovers free,— Then to send a world's kiss pressing through your single mouth to me. This is noblest compensation—to put out the human race, But to leave the love-light burning through your eyes and in my face —Thus to let us feel our oneness, I with you, and you with me, And your oneness with the starlight, and my oneness with the sea. Place this once, my stainless darling, your pure lips upon my own: These at least are wholly sinless, these at least are mine alone. Now let sweet death seal the marriage! when two souls are one at last Then death's darkness is not darkness, for the power of death is past. Not to-morrow shall we, waking, hear the wheels of London roll, You with sin's kiss on your whiteness, I with madness in my soul: Nay, for ever now around us let the vast night's curtains be! We are safe within the darkness; we are safe within the sea. TO THE UNIVERSE-GOD God who leadest human creatures safe through many a path and winding way; Thou whose word the leaping thunders and the foam-sprent warrior-waves obey: Thou whom not alone the roses worship with their tender-glowing bloom But, besides, the waving grasses gleaming round about the granite tomb: Thou whom all the ancient nations sought, and brought their gifts to thine abode; Thou through whom the heart of Jesus with the eternal perfect pity glowed: Thou through whom our country's glory reached its splendid perfect flower indeed; Thou who gavest to the people Love for sign and Freedom for a creed: Still thou livest,—livest surely? God, thou art not dead, as some men say, Men who preach the saws of Science and they win the people to their way? Nay, thou livest, livest surely. Far beyond the fiery whirl of fate Thou the God of Love art thronéd, King on whom the giant ages wait. Through a thousand mystic voices thou hast spoken to unnumbered years, Thrilled the heart of priest and singer, thrilled man's fervent soul to fire or tears. Thou wast in the old religions, God of glittering war and white-robed peace; Thou wast in the face of Venus, thou didst tread with her the shores of Greece. Thou wast in the buoyant waters leaping round her rising from the wave; To her hands their deathless magic thine hand full of stranger magic gave. In the gods and in the people thou the Spirit of all things hast thy part; Thou wast in the ancient temples, in the splendours of Athenian Art. All true souls and noble found thee, thee the unchanging God, the deathless One, In the million stars of midnight, in the flowers, the sea-waves and the sun. In strange shrines of many a goddess thou wast hidden, thou the God supreme, Light behind the deadly darkness, truth within the interminable dream. Never one soul quite escaped thee. Thou its Maker hadst a word for each. Through wild sins and wild contritions thou hadst ceaseless power to raise and teach. Thou didst thunder over Sinai, thou didst stablish David on his throne; Through the starless midnight darkness thou didst speak to Solomon, alone. Hast not thou, thou Power omniscient, watching over stars that crowd the skies Still reserved the light of passion, unrevealed save only in woman's eyes? Lovelier than the leagues of starlight, purer than the heavens where great suns gleam, Is the light that passion kindles, even as truth is lovelier than the dream. Thou art deep within all pleasure—thou who scatterest on the hills the snows Art as well within the fragrance of the luscious crimson-petalled rose. Thou who o'er the viewless summits passest like the thunder-footed storm Art as well within the valleys,—grace thou givest to the wood-nymph's form. Thou wast in the soul of Phidias when within the imperishable stone Deep he graved eternal beauty,—and the dream of beauty yet unknown. For in every noble statue sleeps a dream of wonder unrevealed,— Something that the stars have seen not, something that the sweet earth cannot yield. From the statue's lips of triumph comes a murmur, “Not yet all is done! Lovelier than all earthly beauty waits beyond the moonlight and the sun.” Thou, immortal Spirit of beauty, speakest thus through lips of flawless stone, And through other than the statue's, through the model's soft lips' living tone. While the man can mould the statue, thou alone with loving touch and warm Canst enshrine thy dream of beauty in the woman's lovelier living form. Thou the eternal heavens' own Sculptor sendest forth the products of thy skill, Shapes that haunt man's heart for ever, eyes that dazzle and the lips that thrill. Through all poets thou hast spoken, leading each along the darkling ways; Crowning each with thorns of sorrow, then with star-crowns woven of deathless rays. Unto each some word eternal thou dost give—the power to raise or smite; Music of the golden morning or the dark storm-music of the night: Power to speak thy timeless message on man's planet to the sons of time; Power to make love's dream immortal, power to make a moment's bliss sublime. Fragrance of a million blossoms on the breezes every morning dies, But the flower within the poem blooms beneath thought's ever-radiant skies. Fragrance of unnumbered passions on the wind of time is wafted far, But a mighty poem's passion, changeless, shares the life of sun or star. From the hell where woman struggles, lurid hell where ceaseless bale-fires gleam, She shall rise, superb, immortal, changing into love's wild passion's dream. Though for ages vast, unnumbered, she content has been half queen, half slave, Heedless how or what she squandered, so that only her generous instinct gave: Though for ages she has given, winning not the high return she sought, Yet her sweet deferred pure triumph waits her in the dawning age of thought. Thou who hast watched her tribulation, watched her anguish through the darkling years, Spirit of love not only of passion, thou hast heard her moans and marked her tears. Not one maid in Eastern harem sold and wrecked that man's fierce lust might reign But shall win rich restitution, in some sphere where joy shall balance pain. Not one girl in modern London ruined and soiled for some man's passing whim But shall in the end be queenlike, bring deliverance it may be to him. Thou dost keep divinest record: not one silent sacrifice of tears But shall see its hope accomplished, after it may be twice a thousand years. Time is nought, and thou art deathless—thou on whom thou willest canst bestow Life on life in which to blossom, endless years in which the soul may grow. Flowers on earth for a million ages, these have lit the ways with boundless bloom,— Thou the Spirit of love retainest still thy fairest flowers enwrapped in gloom. Woman's is the unknown future—man's has been the long past dark with crime; Now through many a golden era woman's heart shall make man's heart sublime. She shall bring the earth redemption,—fit our star to hold communion high With bright sister-stars and sinless, glittering spotless in the untainted sky. For all stars may hold communion, all the planets' souls are doubtless one; Star to star may speak responsive, moon to white-souled moon, and sun to sun. Woman on our earth may doubtless render earth as pure and man as free As pure stars and starry races hidden in blue mist on the astral sea. Not alone on earth thou toilest: in the countless stars that traverse night Thou the Spirit of all art regnant, filling all the cloudy tracts with light. Rivers flashing hues of sapphire, emerald groves and opal-coasted isles, Waves that welcome ardent sunrise with a thousand golden-rippling smiles: Boundless plains and giant forests, mountains lordlier than our hearts can dream, These upon the stars thou rulest—icy wastes on phantom-planets gleam. Titan Andes, Himalayas, heights that dazzle with perpetual snows, Bowers wherein the flowers fade never, deathless lily, never-darkening rose: Bowers wherein pure love speaks ever, love more soft-voiced than our planet hears, Shores where passion's richer rapture thrills far tenderer souls to sweeter tears: These in unknown realms thou swayest, realms where suns are scattered like the grains Flying abroad in windy harvests, torn by tempest from the golden wains. Lo! the brain of man turns dizzy at the thought of sky-leagues stretching far; Never gate nor wall nor barrier—past each outpost still another star. Is there any farthest outpost, any silent sentry-star that waits Guardian on the dim sky's borders, watchful at the invulnerable gates? Nay! beyond, another sentry—still another, ceaseless through the night; Still another's bright spear glittering, still another helm of fiery light. Human brain may well turn giddy, human thought will never reach the goal: Yet the Ruler of the star-waste hath his temple also in the soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. IX TO THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND When this strange stormy nineteenth century closes, Reaching the goal towards which its wild wheels move, Though earth's green banks will bear their countless roses Will there be women born whom man may love? There will be—doubtless—brains so full of learning That in them will be room for nought beside: Will there be eyes to awake the old love-yearning, Lips sweet as those for whose sake men have died? In Shakespeare's England—“merry,” then they named it! In truth it was another realm than ours; Woman's unsexed mad champions had not claimed it, Robbing the soul of love, the land of flowers. No women-prophets then had risen to teach us That man is wholly sensual, wholly vile; Eager with frown and stamp of foot to reach us (Though woman once could conquer with a smile!) The platforms trembled not—in happier ages— At the impassioned sisters' manly tread: No bands of wild-eyed youths and hoary sages Followed supine, while martial woman led. Man had not cast his sword away—he grasped it— Nor had he set his helm on woman's brow; 'Twas on his own till Mona Caird unclasped it; He was not swordless, helmless then, as now. He had not learned that occult lore reposes On woman's lips; his earlier creed was this— That Nature made them when she made the roses, And that they preach most purely in a kiss. Still of love's bark man was the patient steerer: He had not, cowardly when the waves arose And when the threatening towering rocks loomed nearer, Let woman steer the doomed bark as she chose. A woman's “mission” was the mission ample And all divine, and wholly, nobly, sweet— To lift by love and exquisite example, Not to downtrample with exultant feet. A woman's “right” was that one right unmeasured, The right to give, the “mission” to be won: That right supreme shall by man's heart be treasured As long as God's hand treasures stars and sun. To-day the women calculate and ponder, And calculation's woman's deadliest sin —“Is love's crown wrought of flawless gold, I wonder? If I give so much, how much shall I win? “Is this kiss worth a brooch, that kiss a carriage? What is the value in jewels of my embrace? How may I compass best a wealthy marriage? What is the market value of my face?” Oh, not in ways like these did England's daughters Aid England's sons to found an empire wide As the moon's silent path across the waters, An endless realm in which the sun took pride: Nay! love and beauty were the themes inspiring The poets who at England's dawning rose —There were no lecture-rooms, mayhap, for hiring, Where woman might descant upon her woes. In Shakespeare's England Mona Cairds were powerless; No Westminster Review his eyes had seen: Yet was that grand age songless, loveless, flowerless? Whence sprang that deathless cry of Egypt's queen? “Husband, I come!” Was that cry not inspired By English wifehood, death-defying, true? Must not some living Desdemona have fired The heart conceiving and the hand that drew? Ophelia, Portia, Juliet,—names unnumbered Leap to the lips or linger on the tongue. Their models woke, and lived and loved—then slumbered, But still song's magic makes their sweetness young. Was woman's soul inferior then—inferior Her grace unspeakable of brow and hand? Was she not, being unconscious, far superior To those whose wild shrieks tire a weary land? When Raphael made fair womanhood immortal, When Titian on the undying canvas wrought, Woman was goddess at the blue heaven's portal, But now her forehead wrinkles with its thought. She thinks too much to-day, and loves too little, She who was once the priestess of the heart. The chains of love the thinker weaves are brittle, But love weaves chains death's hand shall fail to part. In ages too remote for man's frail counting Some youth, it may be, pausing on his oar Watched a girl-swimmer the blue waves surmounting, Bound for the green-robed silver-girdled shore: He, ere his dream of matchless beauty perished, Speaking impassioned to the folk at home, Launched the fair legend that all time has cherished Of Venus born from the enchanted foam. From that one woman whom the waters tossing Steered shoreward gently in some Southern clime Sprang the strange Venus-legend, all engrossing, Whose sweet resistless charm will baffle time. But who from women of to-day will gather A legend glorious as that tale of old, Legend to which the fiery sun was father, Flaming from heaven, arrayed in cloudless gold? Not love, but Hebrew and Greek and physiology, And scientific secrets deep and strange, Astronomy, and Chinese, and conchology —Through all these regions woman now must range. And yet in one young cheek's soft merry dimple There lies the witchery most potent far: One girl's glance, full of trustful love and simple, Sparkles more sweetly than the evening star. O women of England, new stars gleam and glisten, The moulding of the future as of the past Lies in your hands—yet, if it may be, listen To one voice from the century closing fast: Heed your own hearts, not this wail never-ending From over-burthened souls who have gone astray; Love as of old from the bright skies is bending; Speak ye his message—man's heart will obey. The women-teachers of to-day are flightiest Of all who have taught—remember, for your part, That youth will gain its impulse purest, mightiest, Never from woman's brain—from woman's heart. The future may be dark—man's soul climbs slowliest Of all things living towards the starlit skies: Yet, ever, youth will learn its lessons holiest Not from the stars, but from a woman's eyes. KENSAL GREEN I O'er the graveyard burning noonday poured its flood of stainless golden light; In that hour the sun seemed victor over all the doubts and dreams of night. II From the heavens of boundless azure, from the air superb with summer's breath, Came, it seemed, a thrill of triumph, wide-winged triumph over wingless death. III Though the dead around lay silent, though a thousand souls had watched in vain, Summer's heart of endless sweetness seemed to soothe man's heart of endless pain. IV “Rest within the arms of summer; fearless, meet the summer's sunlit gaze:” So the soft breeze seemed to whisper, roaming through dim paths and sombre ways. V Yet, I wondered, hath the summer in its glory share or part with those Who have passed beyond all summers, far beyond the sunlight and the rose? VI Though the rose again be radiant, though June's dazzling banners flame and gleam, Are the silent eyes regardful, do the ghosts within the dark graves dream? VII While the waves of life pass o'er them, are they resting blank of gaze below, Neither reached by summer sunshine, nor the shafts of frost nor spears of snow? VIII All the mighty life of London pours its ceaseless giant stream along: Here at Kensal Green is silence, iron silence after reckless song. IX Here the warrior's sword is broken, here the flower-bright heart that loved and gave Fades within the leaden blackness, like one roseleaf in a boundless grave. X Here the love that, like the ocean, seemed to compass all the shores of time Cowers within its lampless prison, weak and broken, like a halting rhyme. XI Love that found the whole of starland space too small for aspiration's breath, Here where mightiest stars are helpless, pants and struggles in the cage of death. XII Love that cried “I am immortal! part of God as God is part of me,” Love that felt its strength pulse through it, like the pulse of tide-waves of the sea; XIII Love that cried “I too am deathless, like the God who sways the heights of space,” Meets within death's vaulted chambers, shuddering, only death's own spectral face. XIV Love that deemed the stars were kindled for its sake, and for its sake alone, Meets decay the fleshless horror swaying the darkness from its starless throne: XV Love that held that all creation moved to mandate of a loving Lord Sees the white throat of creation drip from blood-red stabs of terror's sword: XVI Love that found all flowers most fragrant nought beside the charm that passion brings, Loveless, sinks amid corruption, mocked by grave-stained ghosts of crownless kings: XVII Love that dreamed it had no ending, fair and proud with many a rainbow-gleam, Ends as all past life hath ended, dreams it lives and closes as a dream. 1895. XVIII So I pondered. Since I pondered, I have seen a living face arise; Seen a face from out death's darkness flash with still unchanged and loving eyes. 1901. NEW SUMMERS Just as the summer smote the deep Of winter's awful frost-bound sleep, And lo! the rivers ran, And songs began; As laughter sounded on the sea And through the leaves of every tree, And flowers, forgetting pain, Kissed flowers again: Just as new summer for the old Clothed every barren heath with gold— With raiment of bright furze That crowns the hill-spurs; Just as, e'en redder than before, The roses round each cottage-door Smiled, and the bell-flower blue Of tenderer hue: Just as our dreams of mist-winged weeks Fly when the ardent summer streaks The blazing skies with gold, Grand as of old; Just as our dark dreams flee away, Our hatred of the skies grim-grey, And all our hearts respond To summer fond: Just so our fear that Love had fled And that his rose-like face was dead Is changed to laughter sweet When Love we meet, More beautiful for winter rest, With summer plumage in his crest, And in his hands the sprays Of summer days. Has winter seized one love of ours? New loves shall blossom with new flowers. Loves fairer than of old Thou shalt behold! Loves more bewitching than the past In summers new shall follow fast; Eyes lovelier than the eyes That lit past skies. Oh, wait for summer! Like a dream, With hands that lure and eyes that gleam, Some woman waits for thee By moonlit sea:— Hear how her laugh along the lone sand rings! Mark her neck whiter than that sea-bird's wings! Lo! summer brings her near: Wait thou,—and have no fear. July 3, 1881. A LONDON SEASON Hour follows hour, and day succeeds to day, And the short night gives place to morning grey, And still our feet pursue The phantom, Pleasure, glimmering o'er the way But never quite in view. One day is weary, and the next the same: We have no high pursuit, no settled aim; We follow Pleasure hard. Still, as we follow her, and strive to claim, We meet some window barred. Just as a lover, on some summer night In Italy, pursuing, loses sight Of the sweet form he seeks Within some shrubbery, and her floating white Robe haunts his dream for weeks: So Pleasure shuns us, yea we find her not Amid the heated rooms and in no spot Where languid Fashion dwells; She loves, perhaps, bright beach, or ferny grot, Or green stream-cloven dells. Through the sweet summer night in country lanes And country gardens after soft slight rains Scents numberless delight; Beside the sea's great green dim houseless plains Fringed with their bordering white The wet glad wholesome sand smells fresh and strong, And the sea's limitless June-chastened song Rises upon the air: What have the weary house-pent London throng That can with this compare? Our seasons follow each other, and they find New hearts of men made deaf and women blind To all that Nature brings: Ever the mass of imbecile mankind Will live devoid of wings. But for the poet love alone, and flowers, And woman's heart, make lovely mortal hours; If these he hath he breathes. Without them, curséd are all Fashion's bowers And withered Fashion's wreaths. July 6, 1881. IN LONDON The lips of Venus are as sweet Though sipped within a London street, And her rich hair Is just as soft for lips to meet In London air. And Daphne's limbs are pure and white Though darkness of a London night Beholds them kissed, Not skies with tints of sapphire bright Or amethyst. And Psyche's lips are no less red In that two thousand years have fled With all their flowers Since her old namesake sweet was wed In Southern bowers. And passion is no less divine Though round the brows of love we twine No amorous leaves, Nor white limbs through the water shine On summer eves. For many an age may pass away But still love's eyes confront the day, Challenge the morn, As fair as when, the legends say, Sweet Eve was born. Yea, though a thousand hearts have sung Of woman, woman still is young; Her heart's the same As when round Trojan turrets clung The leaping flame. We find in our old mist-robed land Bright eyes, soft lips, and loving hand, And golden curls: Love wrought with genius when he planned Our English girls. Not Venus rising from the seas Was tenderer of limb than these Whom London rears; We need not give one age that flees Our hopeless tears. July 13, 1881. TO GERTRUDE And dost thou understand me, spirit-stranger, Whose eyes are sweet? Dost thou watch over me, and shield from danger My wandering feet? Art thou, love, with me when the sea's grey billows Would quite cast down? Dost thou then lead me forth beside green willows,— Dost soothe me and crown? I am repaid, if thou dost love me, O stranger, Gertrude (art thou?)— Leading me through defiles of death and danger, With snow-white brow. If thou dost hear me, and all thy spirit listens, I am repaid: If once in thy clear eye the soft tear glistens, Sorrow is outweighed. I am repaid for trouble and tribulation, For grief and pain, If thou, descending from thy queenly station, Dost hear my strain. When mortal women fail, do thou immortal, Uphold my feet: Let white wings shine athwart heaven's golden portal, Where all is sweet. Do thou by night upon my heart descending, With lips more fair Than fairest rose its lavish perfume blending With summer air Console me, and uplift me and restore me To joyous things, Bending rose-soft and snow-ethereal o'er me, With snow-soft wings. 1882. “AS WE GROW OLDER” As we grow older, life grows more divine: Slow word by word and tedious line by line We learn the next world's lore. Then all our hearts are changed, the temporal ends; We bid farewell to old, we make new friends Upon the eternal shore. Wife, mother, brother, sister, father, these Pass, like the passing of a summer breeze; The soul is that which stays. No local earthly frail relationship Hallowed by grasp of hand or touch of lip Defies the fleeting days. Our personality grows wholly new,— Differs from yesterday's as morning dew From dew-drops now absorbed. Closer we cleave to God, and more apart We live, it may be, from the human heart: Our soul's sun shines full orbed. So we pass onward, till we stand at last With every struggle, each love, in the past; Our soul surmounts its throne. Then the large deathless rapture through us thrills: We turn from human hearts, from flowers and hills, And meet God's eyes, alone. 1885. A LOVE-SONG God made us both, and sent the storm to sing Round me: He sent for messenger the crocused spring To thee. He sent the butterflies most bright of wing To thee,— Bade sorrow like a constant sweetheart cling To me. Am I thy lord? Am I as lover and king To thee? Bitter and grievous are the gifts I bring: Love, see! I bring my own unutterable despair To thee: Thou givest thine own beauty, passing fair, To me. Thou biddest summer light suffuse the air For me: My storm of sorrow sweeps the green earth bare For thee. Yet wilt thou hold to me,—with love most rare, Most free? Then God, perhaps, will after all declare For me. Dec. 1, 1885. THOU AND I Oh, this I say of thee, that thy sweet face, When passion else were undisputed king, Reminds me ever of a fairer thing Than passion,—even love, whose gentle grace Fills as with shine of flowers each barren place And makes the birdless sunless mountains sing. Thou bringest back to me, O love divine, O gentle girl-heart full of God indeed, Hope, and a tenderer higher nobler creed. Thou makest this despairing soul of mine Just for one moment bright-hued even as thine: Thou hast the power to lift and power to lead. Just for one moment, while I meet thine eyes, I pass from out the temple of despair And cease to breathe the Dantesque gloomy air, And the dim light of purgatorial skies Brightens. I feel that death's malign mouth lies And that sweet life lasts ever, and ever is fair. And then, thee leaving, back again I pass, Again, God help me! to my proper tomb, Ringed all about with sable starless gloom And blue-green patches of disastrous grass: Thee leaving, I become myself alas! I am despair. Thou art a lily in bloom. 1885. ONE LOVE Let this be said of me, if aught be thought or uttered When I am dead: “The heart that at her coming fluttered, Unshaken, firm before, True till the end remained. While all old dreams forsook him, This one eternal dream with very sweetness shook him As the sea's white soft foam-touch shakes the shore. “A thousand times he dreamed of love. But once love found him, And with an endless wreath of pain and anguish crowned him: Once strong love held him fast. And, when he loved, he loved,—and whom he loved he cherished Till time and life and death, grey-haired and pallid, perished; One love was fadeless till the very last.” 1885. WOMANHOOD AND MANHOOD When womanhood is loved by manhood with the tender Love wherewith I love thee, when manhood's heart can render Homage to her like this, The world will be redeemed. When woman's soul can fashion In the deep heart of man a stainless worldwide passion, Evil will flee before their stainless kiss. This waits,—that every heart of woman win the power To be to some one man his pure immortal flower, His holiest pride and bliss. When womanhood is loved, as I love thee, the yearning Of earth will be fulfilled, and man's will give the burning And woman's mouth will give the angelic kiss. 1886. “HEAVEN IS NO LAND REMOTE” Heaven is not any place. And hell with ardent arches May be discerned amid the feathery-foliaged larches Gleaming.—Our own hearts make The golden towers of heaven, the ramparts high and solemn Relieved by marble white, and wealth of jewelled column:— Our own souls' yearnings fan the fiery lake. From our own thought the waves take life and exultation; The earth moves nearer heaven with each new generation; Heaven is no land remote, Heaven is our old green earth. We can, if we will give it, Impart more heavenly scent to London thick-leaved privet Than fills the airs wherethrough the gold wings float. The fragrance of the soul,—this only brings heaven near us. The eyesight of the soul—this glance we need to cheer us. The soul-glance gives their blue To lake and river and sea: tide-ripples else were duller Than ripples wrought of lead. They win their warmth and colour From warmth within ourselves, and our hearts' hue. Rack weary brain on brain—fatigue the flagging fancy! Search far for heaven!—One square with yellow-hearted pansy Beside its borders set May be to you a heaven far fairer and completer Than soul of prophet dreamed. What Eden scents are sweeter Than rain-washed scent of London mignonette? The storm within the soul takes from the hills their lustre.— The tempest of the heart urges the black fierce cluster Of clouds across the sky. When Love beside us stands, the sun is ever shining; Each cirrhus-band of mist laughs with a golden lining; When Love departs, all stars and suns must die. 1886. “ONLY THE STARS AND SEA” From far beyond my death I seem now to regard thee: Earth's flowers and grass, earth's hills and streams, for thee! The sweet earth seems to have seized thy soul, and closed and barred thee For evermore from me. I seem to feel the breath of sacred death flow round me: The breath of August blossoms floats round thee. Not thine hands, not thine hands to-day have loved and crowned me; Only the stars and sea. The breath of death is sweet, but oh! thy love is sweeter, Thou art more fair, O love,—I moan for thee. In this strange land I faint. Wilt thou, than death's foot fleeter, Hasten, O love, to me? Only the stars and waves, and the black night whose breathing Is cold beside the passionate breath of thee! Only the clouds and stars, the far white waters seething: Only the stars and sea! 1886. “DRIFTING ALONE” I Drifting, drifting alone O'er the wild waste of waters, while the day Sinks swallowed in a haze of sullen grey That hides cliff, shore, and down and creek and bay. No sound save waves that wail and winds that moan: Drifting, drifting, drifting, Drifting on alone! II Drifting, drifting alone Into the darkness of the inhuman sea. Love aided once, sweet Love,—now where is he? Only the boat, the waves, the sky, and she. The sail shrieks out, the racked planks creak and groan: Drifting, drifting, drifting, Drifting on alone! III Drifting, drifting alone Into the midnight, ninety miles away From the old sunlit shores of yesterday. Between her and the land one ceaseless grey Desert, whose billows in fierce monotone Cry “Drifting, drifting, drifting, Drifting to death, alone!” Feb. 3, 1886. THE WOMANHOOD OF FRANCE The womanhood of France is travestied, Held up to scorn By the lewd Art of France. Yet many a heart In France is nobler than all Gallic Art: Love hath not wholly died, Though love may mourn. Though sweet-lipped harlots on the Gallic stage Still hold their own, Sweet-lipped, sweet-bosomed, but with hearts as black And deadly as the midnight's moonless rack, Yet Hugo thrilled the age With sound as of a sudden trumpet blown. Hugo, with Shakespeare's sweetness in his eyes, And in his heart A strength as of the Northern waves that break, Sang how pure love for love's own deathless sake Can face death's flaming skies: His was the Art Of England in some sort, the Art that knows How more divine Than passion's wildest most delirious breath And more triumphant over utmost death Is noble love that grows To kingly stature in the soul's deep shrine. Dec. 13, 1885. THE LONELY YEARNING And dost thou feel, O bard, that in thine heart There are strange powers Unshared of men; That in thine Art Is something cognate to the fields of flowers Or clouds that storm the granite-bouldered glen? And dost thou feel that like another sense Unknown, undreamed of by the common crowd, The beauty of woman thrills thy soul, A joy intense: That thou hast ever to proclaim aloud That Beauty sways beginning, course, and goal? Then, if thou feelest this, If unto thee There is a marvel in the sunset-air And in the swoop of swift or song of bee,— In the sea's kiss A glory that thy fellows may not share; If most of all in Her, Woman, who sways the heart of endless time, The ceaseless years, Thou findest a plenipotence sublime, Beyond thy peers,— If at her eyes thy soul's deep pulses stir; Then strive thou to excel Those unto whom thy vision is not given: If they live nobly, well! But strive thou after even a lordlier heaven. Sink not below the rest. Let blind folk be! Climb thou the mountains thy dream-glances see. 1885. MARRIAGE The woman brings her purity divine: She takes her girlish wreath and lets it shine Upon the man's tired head. The woman brings sweet thoughts and rainbow gleams; The man brings half a life of selfish dreams And selfish thoughts instead. This ought not so to be. They cannot meet, The man, the woman, in eternal sweet High marriage-union so. The man's deep purity should mix with hers: This is the marriage-dower that God confers; This is the gift we owe. All marriage short of this is spoilt and marred, Imperfect, poor, inadequate, ill-starred, Unblessed and undivine. No strange unearthly rapture through it flows; No viewless fragrance, as if mystic rose With lily did combine. When manhood first asserts its inborn strength, Becomes as pure as womanhood at length And meets with noble eyes The fearless eyes of woman, then the race Conquering old lusts and every instinct base To its true height will rise. For then sweet mystery will dawn before Both man and woman, a strange golden shore Of ardent joys and dreams, A griefless wonderful untrodden strand, A flowerful region, an immortal land Of star-rays and moonbeams. All violent grasping after love is sheer Madness and loss. Love lends no earnest ear To eager shouts and cries. Those who will reverence woman she will bless With nobler rapture than the wild caress Of temporal love supplies. The perfect marriage-love is that which breathes Its own still sweetness through the bridal wreaths, The love that joins in one; The love that brings a never-failing peace, The love that though the stars died, could not cease, That must outlive the sun. The love that will not prematurely grasp At pleasure (which then melteth through man's clasp!) The love that waits its time: This love alone can conquer and possess; This love can make the gentlest pure caress Beyond all words sublime. 1886. CHRIST'S WOMANHOOD Woman and man in perfect man unite; The marvellous light Of Christ's eyes had its fount and source in this. In true man strength and sweetness blend their powers, Like diverse flowers Wedded for ever in one marriage-kiss. Through Christ's eyes shone the light, most pure, divine, Which soon shall shine Like God's own sunlight through all women's eyes. The Magdalen caught that saving glance and knew One man was true, And in her soul the harlot straightway dies. When this light shines through all the eyes of men There shall be then No lost souls left on earth to moan and weep. Woman, who is but as a worn-out child Whom pain makes wild, Shall mark that light, and smile, and fall asleep Then she shall wake, And all old pangs that throbbed with weary ache Shall in that healing rest have passed away. New sunlit skies Shall meet the laughing sunlight in her eyes, And on the earth shall dawn love's perfect day. The womanhood Whose sweetness ever in Christ's heart abode Yearning to lift, to gladden, to redeem, Shall purify The earth, and set new stars within the sky, And change life to the likeness of Christ's dream. The Magdalen, Whom Christ by understanding hallowed then, Was the precursor of all women saved. When manhood wills, The blind mad soulless tyranny that kills Shall ended be, and woman unenslaved. Woman first spoke And the first gleam of her far sunrise broke When through Christ's eyes the woman who shall be Loved all the race; When through the sweet sad splendour of his face Shone the true glory of manhood, purity. 1886. “DEATH EQUALIZES ALL” Death equalizes all. The humblest ragged beggar, when he dies, May win a golden bright crown in the skies And at his feet the Seraphim may fall. 1886. THE PERSONALITY OF WOMAN The centuries pass away. In each age woman gaineth A portion of her strength,—but ah, how much remaineth! How much is yet to win! When woman is herself, a free pure soul aspirant, No longer half a slave, and half a sweet-lipped tyrant, Man's freedom will begin. Man is himself a slave, while woman he enslaveth. The roadway straight to hell for his own soul he paveth Who hellward paves her way. Who poisons woman's soul pours poisonous juice abundant Through his own veins, wherethrough the foul stream runs redundant: He toils, and wins his pay. Woman is dwarfed as yet; she cannot win her glory. She cannot shape her fate, nor yet complete her story, And man is dwarfed as well. The final fate of each upon the other's hinges: Her life on man's abuts, and presses and impinges,— And half her life is hell. Weary she is of love that in the same old fashion Sings of her lips and hair, with musical soft passion And words that thrill her heart. Weary she is of this, for all the tender thrilling; And, while her eyes with tears at the sweet song are filling, Higher things she asks of Art. She asks that Art will aid her soul to grow diviner; That love shall lift to God,—apportion and assign her Her place beside her lord. She asks that she shall take her share in strife and labour, She wielding sometimes too her golden-tasselled sabre While man's hand wields his sword. She asks no more the praise of lips and eyes and tresses: Though all her pure soul longs for love's divine caresses She longs yet more for this, For constancy and calm,—and that within the holy Rapture of love the light of heaven may glitter, slowly Heightening from kiss to kiss. She freely gives her lips, she freely gives her beauty; But asks that love may seek the table-land of duty And not the valleys dim. Man she will follow fast, and follow to his gaining, If only after God she knows his soul is straining: Then, she will worship him. Her whole heart yearns to love, and yearns to worship truly. When man be worthy of her, she'll give herself quite newly. Man brings the love of change: But woman shapes the home, and pours from fairy chalice Gifts that can make the home a never-ending palace Of endless scope and range. Weakness still seeketh change. The strong heart holds its station. The purest is the strong most manly conquering nation. By faithfulness supreme To love in all its depth Rome reached her queenly power. When purity was lost, she faded like a flower And ended like a dream. 1886. THE STAR-GARDENS In the dark fields of space the stars are like the flowers: They fill the heavenly meads, and light the heavenly bowers, Some great and strong and grand, Some small and weak perhaps; some scentless orbs and homely; Some proud and haughty stars; some queenly stars and comely; Some, wastes of rock and sand. Some stars are like a rose, and some are as carnations, And some are hedge-flower stars. We needs must still have patience If our star be but small: A hedge-flower star indeed,—a weed perhaps, comparing Its glory with the rest; a planet very daring To tread the lists at all. Patience! the earth is ours. One day, when man is hoary, When every field of earth with battle-blood is gory, When the great task is done, When pain is at an end, pain having taught its lesson, The earth will win a calm beauty beyond expression And rival the old sun. For every star a heaven, for every soul a heaven: This hope supreme and fair to each man's heart is given From Hebrew days to these. The Hebrew prophets preached the end of sorrow and sinning; And now, as if the song of hope were but beginning, It chimes in English seas. Although our star be ranked, in the vast astral order, Low down indeed, though it be but posted on the border, The outlying edge of space, Yet two things hath the earth supremely meritorious Achieved, supremely grand and past man's praising glorious,— She hath this crowning grace,— This grace:—that from her waves with infinite soft laughter Love rose, and never quite, though Sorrow followed after, Forsook the earth reborn: This grace;—that, when the world was sick at heart and weary, Earth found a Christ to die, and found a hill-side dreary And found a wreath of thorn. 1886. TRUST Can I not trust the God who brought me here And made my road a starry or sunlit way? The God who led me on from year to year,— Made fresh flowers spring around me day by day: The God who, knowing that I was to be, Provided beauty for mine every road; Spread out before my wondering eyes the sea,— Wove golden clouds wherethrough his sunsets glowed: The God who made the whole wide earth so fair That I therein for years on years might dwell; Made the white wings of sea-birds throng the air And purple heather-blossoms throng the fell: The God who, having made flower, sun and star, Made one thing fairer,—even love supreme, And thrilled me with its light and sweetness, far Beyond the light and sweetness of a dream. Can I trust God in that strange realm beyond, The which I see not, yet whereto I go, To follow me with faithful love and fond,— To strike new rocks, that forth new streams may flow? Can God, when all the skies of earth grow dark, In new immortal heavens relight the sun? When all the stars of life grow pale and stark Can God's great word requicken every one? Can God provide new rivers and new streams To cleave through heavenly plains their silver way? Make the sweet eyes I only met in dreams Meet mine in regions of eternal day? Can God, who made all earthly love so fair, Complete in heaven the task that he began And shape some nobler woman-angel there, To cling more close than woman clings to man? July 30, 1887. TILL DEATH There are those who love the sunny Southern ocean With its olive-clad and myrtle-scented shore And its waves that know no wrestling tides' commotion; They will dream of its clear waters evermore: For in Italy—perhaps—Love bent and blessed them, Smiling angel-like from depths of bluest sky. So they love the land where perfect Love caressed them More than all lands, and will love it till they die. Others heard Love whisper through the English larches, Heard in gentle spring his gentleness of tone; Saw Love stepping through the fragrant forest-arches, And the banks of yellow primrose were his throne. Or they heard Love's message ever-new though olden, When the autumn winds came sobbing through the sky Strewing forest-paths with crimson leaves and golden: They will love the autumn forest till they die. Others met Love in the darkness of the city, Underneath the dreary fog-wreaths and the smoke: Knew Love's sweetness and his pureness and his pity; Felt the world awake to gladness when he spoke. So they love the grim old city—aye, for ever— Better than the bluest depths of Southern sky. They will love the red moon over our old river: They'll be true to our old city till they die! Nov. 19, 1887. “THE HOUR LONG WAITED FOR” The dim night's solemn sweetness seemed her own: God's very heart of passion bent to heed. The world receded, leaving us alone; The hour long waited for had come indeed. ALFRED TENNYSON While our poets, restless-hearted, wandered far from English cliffs and trees, Seeking nobler inspiration—so they thought—by shores of sunnier seas— While they left the grey old island sung by Shakespeare by their harps unsung England still to thee was flower-crowned, still the splendour on her brow was young: Still for thee her clear waves sparkled with a phraseless magic all their own; Freedom, quitting snowier summits, held the peaks of England like a throne. Freedom to the world-wide peoples spake, thou thoughtest, never mightier word Than the lips of Milton uttered, than among the lone hills Wordsworth heard. At thy very dawn of singing—far o'er English waves the music rolled— Thou didst sing the dawn of Maytime, when the kingcups pave the land with gold. Through a thousand years of history, England's joyous history it may be, English hearts will read thy “May-queen”—as they read it, thrill with love for thee. Never yet the soul of poet, full of passion of spring's lovely prime, Wove within the enmeshed fair verses more of sweetness of the fragrant time: Sweetness of the bright May season, and a sweetness tenderer than of May, Girlish sweetness of the May-queen, queen of all the green land for a day. Queen too, when the sad song ended, of the skies of death she filled with light, Crowning darkness with new starshine, maiden-empress of the impervious night. That was when thy singing lightened first upon the land it was to claim, Hold with all the spell of genius, all the magic of a mighty name. Then to other queens thou turnedst, adding yet another deathless word To the praise of Cleopatra which the unwearying centuries have heard: Making with thy marvellous music earth's fair passionate daughters fairer far, Joining to their crowns for ever yet another matchless lyric star. When the centuries, gazing backward, take account of this our century's song Though but few songs be remembered, clear will ring thy music, sweet and strong. Thou with Hugo and with Browning then wilt win time's great approving word, This, that through thy stately singing ever hope's exhilarant note was heard: This, that as on Browning, Hugo, though the century darkened with despair Still on thee heaven's pure light glittered, still to thee heaven's mountain-heights were fair. Still, for all the scowls of Science, sombre power tyrannic for awhile, Thou didst see beyond the ephemeral darkness radiant morning's golden smile: Morning flashing on the nations, vast exultant morning yet to be, Morning, when the ships of battle yield to ships of commerce on the sea; Morning, when the Russian midnight owns the conquering sun its lord at last, When the days of kings and prisons, hours of chains and tyrants, all are past; Morning, when through Afric's deserts wind no longer, bleeding as they crawl, Slaves who spot the tawny sand-waste with yet redder patches as they fall; Morning, when the people's mandate bids us only crown and recognize Valour, wisdom, stainless merit, and the soul that flames from genius' eyes; Morning, when the love of woman wins at last in that far future hour Scope and room, and right to blossom forth from lovely bud to lovelier flower; Morning, when man's love, developed, manlier now for touch of gentle grace, Treading down the brute within it, looks with godlike eyes in woman's face; Morning, when God's worship merges, as with Christ that nobler creed began, In the service of our fellows, in the limitless pure love of man; Morning, when the Churches teach us, not their bitter parties' rallying-cry, But the wonders of the gospel preached from star to star across the sky,— Marvels of the mighty mountains, shadowy lessons of the purple deep, Secrets of the impassioned summer whose soft kisses lull the winds to sleep; These are morning's far-off glories—these, O singer, thou didst recognize; As in trance on earth thou sawest them, now thou seest with fully awakened eyes. THE POET AND FATE Fate. Singers who charmed the earth are dead: Why singest thou to-day? The Poet. Because the laughing rose is red And white the scented may, And new-born golden light is shed On silver stream and bay. Fate. Thou dwellest 'mid a heedless race: They worship nought but gold. The Poet. Yet will I lift a tearless face Towards Beauty as of old. Her boons of love, her gifts of grace, Are won but by the bold. Fate. Shelley is dead, and Keats is gone, And who will lift the lute? The Poet. Though these be dead, the same strong sun Still changes flower to fruit: The birds' hearts waken, one by one; So why should I be mute? Fate. Sing! who will listen in our time? The poet lives alone. The Poet. Though men reject an idle rhyme, The song-god knows his own,— Inspires them with his breath sublime That they may share his throne. THE SINGER'S DOOM I Defeat and sorrow drive us to despair, But still we sing. Spring mourns all past springs' leaves, but yet is fair, And scents with hawthorn bloom the lazy air, Each spring. II We vow that we will never sing again, But still we sing. “Silence is best,” we say, “for deep heart-pain. Why give our lives to song,—to song, so vain A thing!” III “What is the gain of singing?” so we say— But still we sing. Just as the gold sun rises every day Because some supreme will he must obey, Ordering. IV So we are driven along by some strange will, And still we sing. Frost gives a respite to the singing rill, And winter can arrest the wild bird's chill Stiff wing. V Nought can arrest our singing, for a force Still bids us sing. The same strong power that urges on their course The stars, and clothes anew the hills with gorse And ling. VI We cannot rest, or pause. This is our fate, Half joy, half sting,— To tarry ever at the song-god's gate, And, whether mankind love or mankind hate, Ever to sing. 1885. “NOT ALWAY” Not alway will the heart of woman suffer anguish And her soul's sweetest flowers droop down, decay, and languish, For man's heart will arise And slay, with sword of love, lust the malign slave-master And self, whose worship brings disaster on disaster: Man shall restore the queenhood to her eyes. Not alway can the soul of woman be degraded In this our world,—the world whose dells have been invaded By the rich virgin rose; The world where Dante dreamed, the world where Hugo, later, Took up his chant of love,—the world where Christ, yet greater, Wept God's own tears, even then, for woman's woes. Two thousand years have passed, well nigh,—yet woman weepeth. Not yet the golden star of her redemption leapeth Above the ill-omened shade. Christ saved from plunging deep in black pollution's river The women-souls he loved.—Could even Christ deliver The souls our cities day by day degrade? Hardly, it sometimes seems.—And yet the light is stronger Than all the darkest dark, and love can hold out longer Than hate, the devil's own creed. We need the love of Christ, we need the wrath of Dante (For where the wrath is slight, the noble love is scanty) And Hugo's harp, to raise the dead indeed. 1885. THE UNSEEN LAND I We shall not lonely be: The breakers of death's sea Fringe with their white line no inhuman shore. Within death's valleys meet The faces we found sweet, The hearts and hands that sought our own of yore. Upon death's uplands, lo! Full many a voice we know And flowers like those our living green earth bore. II All, young and old, are there; The child with golden hair, The blue-eyed girl, the man with earnest look. Death's is no lonely land, No waste of desert sand, But glad with silvery laugh of many a brook, And bright with suns like those That in the old days rose, And moonlight floods each ghostly forest-nook. III We need not doubt nor dread: The armies of the dead Beckon us on with many a living hand. The lonelier we are here The less we have to fear For on the other side more dear ones stand: Each summer sends its ghosts Of flowers to death's dim coasts; Each year new loved ones seek that unseen land. THE LONG PARTING They parted beside the cottage door On a beautiful night in June. The soft sea sang to the listening shore And the silver ripples sang to the oar And the dark trees sang to the moon. She said “Good-bye” to her sailor lad And she kissed him with all her heart: And she said, “God speed. It is but for a year.. One year...that we have to part.” A year passed on, and she stood once more On a beautiful moonlit night In the cottage garden as before, And she said, “The sorrowful time is o'er; To-morrow will bring delight. To-morrow my sailor-love will be here; I shall see white sails in the bay: And the long long months of the long long year Will seem but as one short day!” To-morrow!...The bright sun smiled in its glee And the rose smelt sweet by the gate. The thrush bustled out of the great elm-tree: He thought he had news of a wedding to be And he dreaded to start too late. A girl's eyes waited the long day through And the sea-gulls' wings flashed white —When the stars and the moon gleamed out in the blue Clear sky, and the rose was kissed by the dew, Over the wires this message flew: Lost—with all hands—in the night! “THE SONG OF THE BELLS” Once more, once more, rings out on earth The old glad sound of Christmas mirth; Once more the ivy-wreaths we twine And again the bright red berries shine; Hearts that were severed are one to-day And sad souls dare to hope and pray; Jealousy, envy, hatred, scorn, All die in the light of Christmas morn. The chorus swells Of the Christmas bells: Merry and loud is the song of the bells. Yet, as the red glad berries gleam, Some sadness mixes with our dream. So many we loved have passed away Who once were with us on Christmas Day; Before next Christmas heart from heart In sorrow and gloom may have to part; Sweet is the sound of the bells that chime, Yet some hearts mourn at Christmas-time. The chorus swells Of the Christmas bells, But sadness lurks in the song of the bells. Not wholly pain and sad-eyed grief Claim golden berry and fair green leaf; Rather the message of hope and love To-day descends on earth from above; Though rivers be frozen and fields be white The keen stars glitter with added light; In countless hearts the gladness glows That comes with the holly, not with the rose. The chorus swells Of the Christmas bells: “Labour and hope” is the song of the bells. SONNET To my Wife, on the Seventeenth Anniversary of our Wedding Day (Oct. 2, 1889.) So many stormy suns have sought the night, So many stormless noontides passed away, Since that far-off fair stormless autumn day When all the young world seemed so full of light. The world seems darker now, but yet more bright, The more the dark sky gathers robes of grey, Thy love—that shines with holier tenderer ray When all heaven's stars spread golden sails for flight. The one thing stedfast in a world of change, The one light quenchless in a world of gloom, Is love like thine, my noble-hearted wife! And (if man's thought beyond the stars may range) Such love may live, if aught outlast the tomb, In the unknown land where love is light and life. “DREAM-LOVE” When round the paths of boyhood fell the eternal Pure light of morning, mixed with heaven's own gleams; When heaven's own emeralds through the foliage vernal Shone, heaven's own sapphires on the sunlit streams; Then, in those days when all the world was fairer Than ever again this sombre world will be; Then, when the silver moon, love's standard-bearer, Poured stainless light upon a sinless sea; Then, in those days, I loved—and in strong fashion. “Dream-love,” you say? But dream-love is sublime. Ofttimes I think a boy's exalted passion Is the only love that stands the test of time. For then the sense of love with mystery blended Brings heaven to earth, makes all existence grand: But passion understood is passion ended; Love's realm is loveliest as an unknown land. Yet is it ever known? What heart of poet Has ached not as its splendour disappears! Can mortal ever with full knowledge know it,— The land whose sweetness moves the soul to tears? How often have I with eager gaze and burning Striven but once more that far-off land to see: In vain the effort! Fruitless is the yearning— That prize is lost for all eternity. Man's eager gifts bribe not the mute stern warders: The boy might enter, but the man must stand For ever waiting just outside the borders —Angels with flaming swords safeguard the land. O forest-glades wherethrough one fair form wandered! O flower-clad land which I shall ne'er behold! How often have I in riper sad years pondered, Striving again to pass your gates of gold. Alas! the gates are barred, the spell is broken: The purest passion of my life is o'er. O love of dreams, thy soft last word is spoken! O land of light, thy light is mine no more! SHELLEY Through golden years the fame of Shelley grows. From height to height His name is echoed.—In his song the rose Became more bright. He recreated all this world of things: He made all new. Whiter he made the sea-bird's flashing wings, The waves more blue. He thrilled the Italian air with heavenlier gleams His genius brought. Mankind is nearer God for Shelley's dreams And Shelley's thought. And yet, while thousands journey to his tomb And mourn and weep, What of the child who through the dark waves' gloom Passed to her sleep? Never have human sorrowing eyes grown dim At her young grave: Who wails for her, while all hearts weep for him? The wind, the wave! Yet less than his I think her spirit erred Who could not bear Love's loss. She gave him love, but he conferred Man's gift, despair. THE TRIUMPH OF THE BARDS: An Answer to “The Battle of the Bards” Nay! not among the “bards” the “battle” rages, Not there—but rather 'mid the snake-tongued throng Whose hate nor truth disarms nor time assuages, Who, hating sunlight, hate the kings of song. “Where I have failed, shall others triumph? Never! My voice is hushed. Shall other songs succeed?” So whines the ephemeral songless creature ever: Lies are his weapons, hatred is his creed. While in the mist and mire these reptiles quarrel, Emerging, each, from some malodorous lair, To bard on bard time's hand concedes the laurel, Star after star lights darkling wastes of air. While poets' steps ascend the sunlit mountains, While fair before them shines the untrodden snow, While blue beside them gleam the unsullied fountains, The pigmies' “battle” rages far below. The poet's fame is sure and safe for ever; His is the realm of everlasting Art: The songs that move men's souls can perish never, For nought can die that thrills one human heart. While Spring arrays in gems each tenderest flower, Yet fairer in his song their bloom shall be; His is the wild wind's strength, the tempest's power, Morn's splendour on the imperishable sea. While human souls are stormed by passion's madness, While sweet love's joy pours starlight through the gloom, Still is the poet king of grief, of gladness, Master of time and conqueror of the tomb. THE FOUNTS OF SONG Whence springs the sweetness of pure golden rhyme That fills the soul with fragrant dreams for hours? From rose and lily and furze and pink and thyme: The poet's earliest teachers are the flowers. Then, when he craves the thunder for his strain, The strength of song at which the centuries flee, His stern inspiring motive he must gain From the wild waters, worshipping the sea. Another step—and upward. Let the race Of man pour through him its tempestuous might! Let him find marvel in the lowliest face And on the dullest brow a crown of light. Another step—still upward. From above There flows an inspiration higher than this: Through woman's pureness speaks the eternal love, As woman's beauty speaks through woman's kiss. Another step—the last. When all these things Are one by one discerned, all pathways trod, Choosing the road that mocks the eagle's wings The poet's heart must seek the heart of God. Aug. 14, 1891. FROM ETERNITY TO ETERNITY O weird pale pitiless stars, so wan and cold, Planets that knew no youth, yet are not old, Ye watch with deathless eyes Our death-filled years,our bitter days and hours: Yet are ye heartless,—just mere golden flowers Crowding the purple skies? O strong strange stars that glitter through the night, Are ye all speechless? Are your eyes so bright, Yet do they never weep? Are mortal agonies mere passing gleams That flash across the darkness of your dreams But never break your sleep? Out of the far eternity ye came: Into the far eternity ye flame: Our time-realm lies between The twin eternities that ye can hold Fast linked in your slight chains of glittering gold, Joined by your fitful sheen. Between your twain eternities are we; We and our surging lives, our tossing sea Of human strife and care. But ye—long ere the earliest race began, Long ere the moulding God first fashioned man, Your lamps flashed through the air. Before one woman's soft eyes thrilled the light Of far-off morning, ye, star-eyes, were bright, Bright as in this our day. Ere children's voices sounded 'mid the trees, Ye heard the rustling melancholy breeze Wail, on its lonely way. Ye shine to-night on England; and when she Sleeps, silenced in the dim futurity, Past rapture or desire, Still will ye gaze from heaven,—unchanged, as bright As when the darkness of the primal night Leaped at your touch to fire. 1886. ONCE MORE I “Far out where waves are breaking, Where never song-bird sings, My soul would fly, forsaking All flowers and inland things. I am weary of the bowers Where summer's heart is won; I am weary of the flowers; I am weary of the sun: Where only star-rays sunder The darkness, I would be; At rest, while wild waves thunder The anthems of the sea.” II Ah! so my soul went crying— And yet Love lured me back: I heard the soft winds sighing Again round summer's track. Once more the old earth drew me, Though in my soul was scorn; Again love's dart thrilled through me For love again was born. Once more the summer's splendour Descending from above In woman's eyes grew tender, On woman's lips was love. 1889. “HER LAST COURT” If thou wert dead, there could be no to-morrow! Darkness would veil the glory of the sun. —If thou wert dead, the bright blue sky would sorrow: Summer would shiver on his lonely throne. Spring, with its hosts of buds and flowers advancing Alert and joyous to the bare earth's siege, Would miss thy laughter's old clear sound entrancing And pause upon some forest's leafless edge. Autumn in vain, with crowns of crimson splendour In sunburnt grasp, would gaze around for thee. Winter would miss thy touch so warm and tender: Despair would chill the light heart of the sea. The fairies in the woods would whisper, weeping: “Earth's sweetest lady, and most to us akin, Lies now beneath the grass, for ever sleeping. What prize is left on earth for man to win? “The hair whose lustrous black might once have maddened The hearts of kings, before the worms is spread. Death's lips at touch of lovelier lips are gladdened: Death's cold hand rests beneath the stately head. “The voice that won the soul of Art to love it, That thrilled men like the music of the wave, Is silent as the soulless weeds above it: Beauty now holds her last court...in her grave.” March 27, 1890. THE PALACE OF THE DEAD Sometimes, when music sounds, Towards some strange palace I am led Where meet, methinks, the dead: I travel through enchanted grounds. Within those palace-walls, bright-eyed, They dance, converse,—as love or music leads. But I, within the darkness, left outside, Shiver, and hear the hoarse wind through the reeds. 1892. “HOPE DIES’ Hope dies in many a heart, as life grows older: No more with young bright dazzled eyes we see A thousand diamonds on each wave's white shoulder, A thousand emeralds in each sun-kissed tree. No more the road to heaven seems all placarded From starlit side to side: “Admission free.” Love, seeking woman's heart, is checked, retarded; Winged love must pause, and pay his entrance fee. A poor man toils to win a girl's devotion: Some rich man wins her in a night, maybe! Man's thoughts are rocks that breast time's tossing ocean, But woman's thoughts are changeful as the sea. TWO SONNETS WRITTEN AFTER WITNESSING SARAH BERNHARDT'S PERFORMANCE OF THE PART OF “LA TOSCA” I. Forget the flowers of summer, even forget The world-wide reign of daylight and the sun; Share with the stars of night the glory of one Star-crowned for ever, one whom never yet Being born of heaven hath mortal equal met: Forget the sands that through the hour-glass run; Forget, disdain, till these charmed hours are done The moans of grief, the storm-cries of regret. For just one moment lo! the peace of Art Triumphant ever, let who will withstand, Renews the brain and sanctifies the heart For one thing sorrowing, that the power that gave Nobly so much may raise not from the grave Dead Shakespeare's genius, here in Shakespeare's land. II. Yet here in England, though dark dreams have sway, Though in the sea-girt isle where blooms the rose Art, rose-crowned, sea-voiced, hath a thousand foes, When genius speaks ten thousand hearts obey. On England's stage pale shadows have their day, Then to the land of shades each shadow goes And England wakes to welcome one who knows What Art's deep soul through woman's voice can say. We who have worshipped from our natal hour Art, following eager even her slightest glance, Praise heaven that flowerless fields at length may flower, That through the gloom Art's sunlit steps advance, While England honours her whose matchless power The gods who give to man first gave to France. June 27, 1892. A GREETING “We are not so shrouded as we seem, and there is dawn close on the heels of darkness.” —L. C. B. Though still the darkness on the hills is lying And still the starless horror of the night There comes a voice that cries, “The gloom is dying!” There comes a sound and rumour of the light. We who have watched through sunless years and waited Nor seen the hosts of darkness once withdrawn Nor felt the stress of anguish once abated Hear half in doubt a whisper of the dawn. The light we see not yet superbly gleaming Across the wastes of unaccustomed skies May reach a younger soul, may now be streaming Athwart the clouds that part for younger eyes. Hail, friend, who seest the far-off morning bringing Triumph the Church's treacherous spears delay: Greeting from those who 'mid the gloom are singing To one whose song shall sound beneath the day. Greeting to one who, when thought's host advances, When morning's jewels flash on flower and tree, Shall meet morn's sun-bright look with equal glances And see the face we love but shall not see. Greeting to one who, though the dark around him Grew loud with tongues that clamoured and defamed, Knew none the less the sun-god's hand that found him, The smile that drew, the regnant touch that claimed. Greeting from hearts which in the darkness fighting, Lit by the flame alone of flashing swords, Bound at the news of bright-helmed morning smiting With golden bow the raven-armoured hordes. Greeting from one whose troubled note gave warning Though starless robes swept flowerless field and lawn Of the rich plumes and crimson robes of morning, The lustrous pomp and pageant of the dawn. The singer passes, but the dream he cherishes With heart that chides the insufficient tongue, This passes not; it fades not out, nor perishes: The dream that thrilled him once, now thrills the young. He saw fair love approach, whose touch discloses Veiled secrets hidden in history's moonless night: He saw love, lying dead among white roses, With brow and cheek than roses even more white. He watched the sunset on cold mountains dying; He watched the hopeless foam on sunless seas:— Now waves and mountains cry, “Too self-relying, Young hearts are living—thy thought lives in these! “Around thy path have stormed with onset breathless Truth's foes, the lovers of old crime and wrong; But England lives, and fearless thought is deathless, And on youth's brows abides the light of song. “Thy sword that, if it conquered not, ne'er rusted, Thy shield that bears the dints of countless blows, Thine helmet—these, to England's youth entrusted, Shall watch the flight and downfall of thy foes.” March 11, 1894. “LOVE YIELDS HIS SLAVES UP NEVER” I Once more, with skies above her Of endless perfect air, With sunlit leaves to love her And whisper, “Thou art fair;” Once more—and statelier, surer, When summer's hymn was done— From woman's mouth came purer The anthems of the sun: Once more, in honeyed metre That charmed grief to repose, From woman's lips came sweeter The lyrics of the rose. II Once more the word was spoken That fills with mirth and might The heart,—then leaves it broken:— Grief once more slew delight. Delight again came saying (And I believed again!) “When pleasure goes a-maying Grief is not of his train.” When silvery may-bloom glistens Is there one whitethorn leaf Sun-kissed and glad which listens To the cold song of grief? III Not one. So, each spring season The human heart awakes, Forgets past grief and treason: Man's whole heart never breaks. One woman's heart is broken, One man's heart flags and dies: Love's last word is not spoken; The sun is in the skies. A thousand souls each summer Would learn Love's rites and laws: Dead lies the pale last-comer; They glance, but never pause. IV Each says: “Though hearts preceding Were broken one by one, Yet follow we Love's leading As hope pursues the sun. A thousand shipwrecks follow The North wind's course, maybe: Does one fierce shipwreck hollow One slight gulf in the sea? Nay! all the sea is smiling, As if no ship were slain; The blue waves are beguiling The white sails forth again. V “Some new ship, newly starting, May win the unseen far goal; May bribe the waves swift-darting, Evade the thunder's roll; May reach the magic islands Where perfect pleasure waits, Soft fragrance from whose highlands May float through morning's gates.— So we, past wild winds' capture, Past waves that wail and moan, May win the unfading rapture No man has ever known.” VI Aye, so man argues daily. The very fields that saw Love's death, hear voices gaily Proclaim love's deathless law. Within these forest alleys To-day two histories close; To-morrow forth love sallies Pearl-laden from the rose:— Here some sad heart was broken; Sad eyes saw nought beyond; Here love's first word is spoken And new soft eyes respond. VII We force Fate's gates asunder; The young, the glad, the old, The sad, hear August's thunder, See autumn's forest gold: All souls, together blended, See all the year go by; See June's wild rapture ended, Watch hoar December die: Yea, even the deadliest weather When ocean's victory's won To glad hearts linked together Seems gracious with the sun. VIII Is hope in one heart dying? Is rapture wholly fled? The great sun is not sighing: The bright stars are not dead. With footsteps surer, firmer, New lovers tread the vale; Their young red soft lips murmur The same sweet glad old tale.— Love yields his slaves up never; He grants no soul release: Love haunts all hearts for ever, Yet brings not one heart peace. SONNET To L. Cranmer-Byng The Crown of Song. Seek thou the crown that brightest shines of all,— That ever has gleamed before man's envious eyes Seductive most, and most inviolate prize:— Proud beauty wanes, and world-wide empires fall; Rank ivy chokes some king's old banquet-hall; Friendship may fail, the flower of passion dies; But Thought within the imperishable skies Sets stars that make the ages' festival. Great is the power of golden-voicéd rhyme: Yea, though the grief-scarred centuries one by one Flag, and their wings grow weary of the sun, The song that makes an hour of bliss sublime Endures, when all works wrought and all deeds done Sink in the eddying foam-white waves of Time. Oct. 22, 1894. STARS UNCOUNTED Through many a vale of sorrow The human spirit goes. All human hearts are aching, And some are well nigh breaking; But all hearts, sunward turning, With deep wild pain are yearning For some divine to-morrow Of passionless repose. If life's sad days were endless, If no to-morrow's sun Brought peace into our sadness, Sometimes a note of gladness, A whisper sweet and cheering, A sign of dark clouds clearing, Then well might man the friendless Sigh, “Would that life were done!” Though heights tower unsurmounted, And though the sunshine waits And longer seems to tarry The heavier load we carry, Though tenderest dreams of ours Die like the pale dead flowers, Yet are there stars uncounted Behind the dark night's gates. LYRICS I. THE GIFTS OF TIME The gifts of Youth are passing fair: Through many a soft spring day Their tender fragrance scents the air, But—then they pass away! —Hope, dying ere its blossom glows: Faith in the false world's truth: Faith in the swiftly fading rose:— These are the gifts of Youth. But fairer are the gifts Love brings; Is there one humble cot, One palace of a thousand kings Where star-crowned Love is not? —A rapture passing earthly speech: Light stolen from heaven above: The power, it seems, that heaven to reach:— These are the gifts of Love. But yet one other figure waits: In sunshine or in shade, With eyes that meet and conquer Fate's, It tarries undismayed. —Life's harvests, bright on either hand: Joy changeless, deep, sublime: Peace filling all the golden land:— These are the gifts of Time. II. ANOTHER MEETING The sense of leaving thee is pain severer Each time the moment comes when we must part: And yet by this I know that thou art dearer, Dearer than ever to my doting heart! Love's sacred pain hath power to bless Even in its very piteousness; It makes a thousand love-stars shine out plain, For though we part, we soon shall meet again! Yes, there will come another hour of meeting, More love-sweet moments—moments tenderer far; Wild moments, when the heart with passion beating Feels oneness with all flowers, with every star. Are last night's roses pale and dead? Behold, a new rose lifts its head! One moon's deposed? Another moon will reign, Acclaimed by new stars, when we meet again! —When there are no more meetings in the meadow And no more meetings by the moonlit sea, What will be left within the eternal shadow, Within the shadow of death, for you and me? What will be left us? What but love, Supreme on earth, supreme above? Immortal love, and passion without pain: We'll meet once more—but not to part again. III. GOLDEN LOVE “Oh, well I love the red red gold,” So sang the maiden fair: “I love to twine in fold on fold My bright soft golden hair. In spring the golden daffodils Shine out in field and lane, And when red gold the coffer fills Why should a girl complain— And when red gold the coffer fills Why should a girl complain, complain, Why should a girl complain?” There came a lover bold and strong To worship and to dare; His voice of gold sang passion's song, He stroked the golden hair. And now her thought cared nought, cared nought, For all past golden gleams; 'Tis golden love, by heaven's hand brought, That flashes through her dreams— 'Tis golden love, by angels sought, That flashes through her dreams, her dreams, That flashes through her dreams! “I have no gold nor lands,” he said— She said, “But love is fair; Kiss once again my golden head,— Place, thus, love's circlet there.” Then, doubly bright, bright flower and star With golden beauty gleamed, For love makes all things lovelier far Than mortal's heart has dreamed— For love makes all things lovelier far Than mortal's heart has dreamed, has dreamed, Than mortal's heart has dreamed! IV. HAPPIER DAYS In youthful days the woods and hills Seemed full of fairies pure and bright: Their voices mingled with the rills; Their beauty dazzled mortal sight. In youthful days, in youthful days, On moonlit cliffs, by sun-kissed bays, Our hearts could hear the fairy lays —In youthful days, in youthful days! But then a silence weird and strange Fell on the hills and on the sea: Death, sorrow, falsehood, sickness, change, Had hushed the fairy minstrelsy. The fairy queen—so it was said— Lay dying on a cowslip bed, Death-white beneath the moon's pale rays —In later days, in later days! But happier days brought back the light To earth and heaven and sea and grove. Love's starry splendour mocks the night! Time tilts with pointless spears at love! True eyes, pure hearts, and loving hands, Bring blessing deep as fairy land's, And fill man's thankful heart with praise —In happier days, in happier days! V. SOME ONE I loved in life's glad morning, When summer airs were sweet: I brought my heart to some one And laid it at her feet. But ah! the glad dream vanished: Then all the summer fled; The green leaves shook and trembled, My heart for years seemed dead. I gave my heart to some one. How changed the world would be If only that lost some one Had given her heart to me! So dreamed I in life's morning, So dreamed I in despair. But time brought noble solace; New sunlight filled the air. Time brought me my true sweetheart, My some one, good and bright: Time filled my day with sunshine And filled with stars my night. Now all my song is, “Sweetheart, An altered world I see Since you, my love and darling, Have given your heart to me!” VI. “ONE DAY’ Upon a perfect starry night We stood beside the silent deep, Tranced in a still supreme delight, While all the earth was tranced in sleep. “O holy stars that gaze from heaven above, Guard us,” I murmured—“shield true hearts who love! Watch over him, watch over him and me” —A threatening strange moan answered from the sea, “Ah me! Ah me!” And now upon a wintry night, While at my feet the breakers roar Flecking the beach with angry white, I stand just where we stood of yore. There are no stars to-night in heaven above; Dead is my darling, dead are hope and love: Dear beyond words my darling was to me, But he was dearer to the jealous sea, Ah me! Ah me! Not till the sea gives up its dead Shall he and I stand face to face: No soul once clasped has ever fled Back from the mighty sea's embrace. But when the sea yields up its hosts of dead Our marriage-bells shall ring—so love has said: One day from out the vast imprisoning sea My dead lost darling shall return to me; One day—Ah me! VII. “FAR IN THE YEARS BEHIND” Somewhere far in the years behind A true heart loved me well: But Fate was fickle, and I was blind— It's nothing new to tell. I acted madly...we had to part... The dear spring daisies came; But I had broken a loving heart And they never seemed the same. Ah! darling love of the days gone by, The daisies were lovely then: They smiled up each to the summer sky; They never will smile so again. For I broke the hearts of the loving flowers When I broke that heart so brave: They never will smile as in olden hours, Unless they smile on my grave. For not upon earth shall I know sweet rest, The rest that I might have attained: Each day, when the red sun sinks in the West, It is one more victory gained! For my hope lies far beyond the sun, In the heaven that is to be When the sorrow of life at last is done And my darling comes to me. VIII. RUSHLIGHT LOVE He gave you love for an hour, He gave you gold for a day, My sweetheart, my wonderful flower; He tempted you, led you astray. But I would have given my heart to you, Darling, my love and my pride; Opened its every part to you, Made you my being's bride! What did he give you? Riches! What are they all but a dream? Wait but till Death's hand twitches The curtain—away they stream. I would have given you passion Pure as God's love, and as free: I would have loved in the fashion, Love, of the stars and the sea. Love, you have chosen the lesser: Mine was an infinite boon. You might have been the possessor, Queen, of the stars and the moon! What did you choose? No sky-gift, Endless, marvellous, grand, But a rushlight dear at a farthing That flickers and melts in your hand. IX. WAITING They had waited and waited and waited,— But the struggle was sad and long. He was only a writer of poems, And what is the worth of a song? She was poor, she was true, she was noble: She loved him with all her heart. They waited and waited and waited, And they watched the days depart. The sweet springs came with their glory Of primrose and crocus trim; The summers glittered and vanished,— And still she waited for him. For the fortune they once had dreamed of Was still in the dreamer's land. Through summer and winter they waited, And they toiled on hand in hand. They have waited and waited and waited; Far-off is their life's young spring: But their love is as tender as ever And has grown to a heavenly thing. I think that the angels love them: One night through the starlit air They will pass to the heaven above them And the angels will marry them there. X. “GOOD-NIGHT!” Good-night! the tenderest sweetest word That our sad restless world has heard. “Good-night!” saith dew-kissed flower to flower, When comes the peaceful sunset-hour: “Soft rest be yours and slumbers light;” “Good-night!” saith rose to rose—“Good-night!” Good-night! and then the world swings round, Till once again its brow is crowned; Till, when the new glad day's begun, Its forehead lightens with the sun. Then, when the sun's broad wings take flight, The tired world sleeps—Good-night! Good-night! Good-night! O word of hope and peace! Word uttered when vain longings cease; Word uttered when wild dreams are done, When stormy grief wanes with the sun. Love's voice serene from starriest height To all the world breathes soft Good-night, Good-night! “THE WAY THE WORLD GOES ROUND” SONG I Spring and summer, joy and sorrow, Rose and lily and autumn leaf; Laughter now, but tears to-morrow, Rapture followed fast by grief; Grass, then snows upon the ground: That's the way the world goes round! II Peace for years and hedgerows hoary With the fragrant bloom of may; War for months, and meadows gory; Stars that weep and turn away From the reeking battle-ground: That's the way the world goes round! III Brave old world! It pauses never. Soon the voices of to-day, Lessening in the vast for ever, Shall be hushed and pass away: But the world shall sweep along, Chanting its old endless song. THE ROSE AND THE LILY I. The Lily watched the stately Rose And envied her her bloom. “I wait,” she said, “in white repose, I might be in my tomb. The Rose is sweet, the Rose is red, Her lover is the Sun: But I—I might as well be dead! I'm loved and sought of none! I never shall be happy, I never shall be red! The Rose has won my sweetheart, I might as well be dead.” II. But oh! one marvellous morning came: The Sun passed by the Rose; He said, “I seek in love to-day The sweetest flower that blows. A rose is sweet, a rose is red, Adorned with endless art,— But as for me, I've sworn to wed Nought but a lily's heart. I never shall be happy” —So sang the Sun so bright— “Without my love, my Lily, So tender and so white.” “HOW SWEET THE WORLD CAN BE!” SONG I The world was sweet to some, love, 'Twas sweet perhaps to thee, Long years before we met, love, And just as blue the sea. But never till we met, love, Were all things sweet to me; I never, never, knew, love, How sweet this world can be! II No doubt the sea was blue, love, And white the white may-tree— But I, I never knew, love, Until love taught it me. Then how the sea gained hue, love, How brightly bloomed the tree; Yes, everything seemed new, love, Because you smiled at me. III And now I know at last, love, How bright God's world can be; The bloomless days are past, love, A light is on the sea. New life thy love has brought me,— I give that life to thee, For thou alone hast taught me How sweet the world can be! THE RIVER'S BRIDE I The River's silver laughter But yesterday I heard: A blither note rang after Than note of brook or bird. A maiden's laughing gladness Made all the bright world sweet: The stream forswore its sadness, And felt its old heart beat. II But ah! the River loved her; Her voice to him was song: It would not yield or spare her; The River's love was strong. With cold white curling wavelets It bore her from the bank: The River laughed for rapture As in his arms she sank. III O cruel, cruel River! Her lips were warm and red; But now thy waves have kissed them, They are so cold and dead! O River, fierce wild River, Thy love was strange and strong, But ah! thy love has slain her, And where is now thy song? HELL I “Traitress!” he cried, “aye, traitress!” And then the dagger smote, And with its point it traversed The white and slender throat. One glance the woman gave him: It was not anger there, But somewhat like the pleading Of infinite despair. II “Harlot!” he cried, “God curse you, Who gavest love to me And then”...the slow stream trickled From her throat wearily. One other glance she gave him, And love was in the look, And as she fell he knew his hell, And even his wild heart shook. III The hell that ever, ever, Till time itself is o'er, Will close around his spirit bound And fettered evermore. Is it not hell to know that she By his own hand did fall? Yes, she is dead, and that gold head Was sinless after all. SONNET To L. Cranmer-Byng Past and Future Thou hast the whole dim past whereon to draw: The past, with all its fury of sword-lit days, Its bitter love matured in hidden ways, Its nights whose secret joys the dead stars saw, When giant passions knew no rein nor law. For thee the past her chariot-wheels delays; She opens murder's lone haunts to thy gaze; She tells of love that pale gods watched with awe. Man's past means rapturous crime and savage wrong:— Round history's steps the bright blood foams and seethes, And with that dew she tinges thy young wreaths; Yet thine own history thou must write ere long: Take all of weird strange power the past bequeaths, But write thy drama not in blood, but song. Oct. 22, 1894. A SONG OF THE SEA I Creeds we build up, then dismantle, many gods we mould and break, But the vast sea's towering godship what most venturous hand shall shake? Human loves give ghostlike rapture, passing joys, ephemeral pain; When a starlike glance has vanished, never shines that star again. II Though a hundred women greet us, though the stars of night return, Still our souls and hearts long wildly, still our wandering fancies yearn: Though the hundred women yield us all their sweetness, as they yield We desire the flower ungathered and the fragrance unrevealed. III Then our thoughts and eyes turn seaward, then the sails of fancy roam O'er the glimmering plains untravelled, o'er the green hills streaked with foam, Chasing her the unconquered goddess, seeking hers the stainless form Robed by day in gleaming sunlight, veiled at night-time in the storm. IV Though the soul of Byron loved her, not to him she wholly gave All her inmost mystic sweetness—just the kiss of wave and wave, This she yielded, this she granted; but the next who sought the prize Found her white neck chainless ever, met the indomitable eyes. V Poet after poet rises, every fiery heart is stirred: Not the strongest, not the lordliest, speaks as yet the final word. After Shelley, song grew weary of the green earth and the sun; After Hugo's song of ocean, still that chant seemed not begun. VI Nought can turn aside the singer from the loves that lure his praise, From the gold-tressed wood-nymph smiling underneath the tangled sprays, From the red-lipped Naiad laughing with a mouth where summer burns, From the maiden stepping gently through the flowers and clinging ferns: VII Nought arrests him, nought can turn him, save the shadow of mighty wings, Save the form of the sea-goddess, save the joy her strange touch brings; Save the sense that in the darkness as it overspreads the deep Rapture undiscerned is waiting, amorous-bosomed wondrous sleep. VIII Virgin ever, unexhausted, are the great sea's loving arms. Who hath ever wholly won her, who hath numbered all her charms? Who hath said “I am her bridegroom, she for me alone is fair,” Lifting star by star her jewels from the midnight of her hair? IX Who hath said, when all the meadows fling their blossoms at his feet, “There is fragrance more seductive and a flowerless air more sweet”? Who hath murmured, tempted softly by some mortal maid's embrace, “I have mingled with the immortal, seen the eternal face to face”? X Human spirit cannot venture: when we pass into the night, When a century's singing closes, still with amorous arms and white Will the ocean seek new lovers, still their noblest chant will be Caught in rapture from the rapture of the wild lips of the sea. LOVE AND LEARNING: A Midsummer Sonnet In Winter gifts at Learning's feet we fling: The sunshine finds us, but through poets' pages; The stars gleam, but the stars of bygone ages; Spenser wreathes Winter with the bloom of Spring. The birds are silent, but the poets sing: In Shelley's verse the undying Summer glows; At Keats' touch smiles again the frost-nipped rose, And Virgil rules mid-winter like a king. Crowned with a wreath of ferns and golden flowers To our pale star bright joyous Love returns, As if his radiant reign were but begun. Let cold-browed Learning sway the wintry hours! But Love, through whose wild heart June's rapture burns, Leaps up to greet the summer and the sun. A POET'S MADNESS The tender love and worship of a child, These gifts she brought: Wreaths simple, like the blossoms of the wild, For him she wrought. And these he valued not.—When men proclaim His glory alas! Let men remember also the deep shame That cannot pass. Not all his gifts are worth the simple heart Whose faith he shook: The sins of genius in the name of Art We overlook. This is a curséd thing. The truth indeed Is otherwise: Far higher than of Art, the simple creed Of loving eyes. Not genius-garlands with their luscious scent, Not these she wove, Not these she sought. She would have been content With truth and love. THE IVORY FAN SONG I “Buy me that ivory fan,” said she, “So daintily carved and white. In all Bond Street, there's nothing so sweet, I love it from morn till night. I gaze all day at that lovely fan, Fair in the window wide; Buy me the fan, love, if you can, And I shall be satisfied.” II “You never were satisfied yet,” said I. “I bought you a bracelet, dear, And a brooch of jet, and a green aigrette, Just at the close of the year. A sealskin jacket, a rosewood bracket, A parrot from Ispahan, An opera cloak, and a stand of oak, And now you are wild for a fan!” III So we quarrelled. 'Twas just a year ago, And where is the voice to-day That said, “If you can, give me the fan”? Hushed, and taken away. She halts no more at the fan-shop door, She needs no gifts from man, And I say to myself with a sad strange smile, “I wish she had had her fan!” A WORD OF WISDOM I Love with all thy strength of being, while the summer days are long, While thy heart can mix its music with the lark's and thrush's song; While the heart of woman seeks thee for the sake of love alone, While thine ardour wins her sweetness, lures her from her starry throne. II Love with all thy might of manhood, while the summer nights are sweet, While the honeysuckle listens for the sound of lovers' feet; While thy voice can ring with passion, while keen rapture can be won, While there's magic in the moonlight, while there's splendour in the sun. III For the time is surely coming when the flowers will still arise, When the rose will meet the sunshine glittering down from azure skies With an undiminished joyance, when the laughter of the sea Still will ring forth to the sea-bird, but no laugh will sound for thee. IV Yes: the time is surely coming when the sunrise with its gold Will seem just a mocking glory, when the thrush will sing, “You're old!” When the light in woman's glances will seem just a mocking gleam, Saying, “Gaze at me and worship—think I love you—fools may dream. V “Fools may dream of love at fifty, or at sixty—let them know Though they win the red-ripe beauty of young lips in fullest glow They are loved not for their sweetness, they are loved for what they bring: Woman loves not mankind's winter, though she maddens at his spring.” NATURE AND MAN Nay! this silvery moonlight making all your bridal room sublime Is the moonlight of vast ages hid in dateless depths of time, And the scent of blossoms wafted round the stainless marriage-bed Is the breath of old-world violets and the roses that are dead. All of history surges through you: all the past with wings of flame Swept resplendent through the doorway, when your sweetheart's footstep came. In your vain conceit and fancy ye may deem yourselves alone: Ye are watched by ghosts uncounted, ye are tracked by hosts unknown. Sweeter are your loved one's kisses for each kiss that clung of old In far-off forgotten woodlands, or by sands of sunlit gold: When your darling's eyes are tender, when they shine with mystic gleams, They resume the light and magic of dead lovers' joys and dreams. When the maiden says “I love you,” she is speaking not—you hear Man's imperious summons sounding on your heart and at your ear; When ye stand with hands that tremble, silent lovers face to face, Not your own wild passion urges, but the love-power of the race. Kiss that human life may die not—find one hour supremely sweet That a million souls may mingle, that a million mouths may meet: Dreaming in your pride and rapture that ye love alone, apart, Know that Nature triumphs with you, laughing low with amorous heart. From your love ten thousand lovers shall draw forth a life superb: That is why keen Nature urges, why her whispered hints perturb; Why she lures you, why she tempts you—why her wanton hands in haste Lift the robe from the white shoulder, loose the girdle from the waist. Only one thing Nature curses, finds but one thing wholly base— Not to aid with each man's passion the vast love-joy of the race; To remain in lonely pureness—which, to Nature, is to be Just a rock of lifeless granite in her star-kissed boundless sea. Just a sterile rock and deadly, spurned of Nature, mocked, abhorred: “Let the lips grow grey that touch not woman's mouth, divine, adored; Let the red warm life-blood leave them,—let man's eyes grow cold and dim,” So she murmurs, “if they seek not the soft eyes that yearn for him!” While the Churches scowl and mutter, Nature smiles and holds her way; Well she knows her force resistless, knows that all worlds must obey:— Star by star the wide heaven kindles, tree by tree grows bright with leaves, Through the kiss of lips that perish the death-conquering race conceives. Lest our feet by night should stumble, she has set in heaven the moon; Lest our souls forget to praise her, given the rose's scent to June: Lest the race itself should vanish, lest it fail at sun or storm, Wrapped the womb for ever fruitful in creation's loveliest form. Oct. 14, 1894. BEYOND! I There's not a flower that ever blows But tells of blossoms fairer far. Who ever saw the sweet queen rose? What eye hath reached the furthest star? There's not a joy that earth can bring But tells of something holier yet: Delight that bears no hidden sting, And joy not followed by regret. This is the gladdening word of time To hearts that sorrow and despond; Each hill-top that our footsteps climb Reveals a grander peak beyond. II Beyond! Beyond each sorrow waits The joy for which it paved the way. Beyond all storms the sunset's gates! Blue skies beyond the clouds and spray! Beyond the hopes and fears of youth The sober strength of manhood's soul: Beyond all doubts eternal truth; Beyond the course the certain goal. Beyond the stars that flash and gleam The heaven unseen by mortal eyes: Beyond earth's sorrow-haunted dream The perfect peace of Paradise! “WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS BRIGHT WITH MORN” When all the world is bright with morn, When sunlight shines on tree and flower, When pain and grief are yet unborn, In life's first golden dazzling hour,— Ah! then when all the world is fair, Its fairest sweetest gifts we claim; Love's rose that scents the enchanted air, The laurels of eternal fame. The world with all its wealth is ours: We steal with laughter and with glee A thousand rubies from the flowers, A thousand sapphires from the sea! A SONG FOR ENGLAND I Lo! another mighty century dying Bears to deathland many a hero's form: Some who saw Napoleon's banners flying; Some who faced red Alma's leaden storm. Yet in passing towards the shadowy portal Fleeting years with fiery tongues proclaim, “Ages wane, but England is immortal; Deathless through each unforgotten name.” II Deathless through her children crowned and deathless, Hearts who battled with a thousand foes Till among star-nations watching breathless In its lonely strength her sun arose. “Isolation?” Needless is the warning. Force supremer isolation brings When the wrath of England flashes, scorning Lies of statesmen and the plots of kings. III Though the leaders one by one are falling Still the nation marches to its goal; Still, as ever, Freedom's voice is calling; Still it rings within the exultant soul. Still the strife of England is not over: Still she needs the sword-arms of her sons, Needs, from Scottish crags to Deal and Dover, Hands on rifles, gunners at the guns. IV Still she needs, from coast to coast patrolling, Kissing white-maned waves with stormy glee, Cleaving tides that round the world go rolling, Fortress-ships to range the unfortressed sea. While her dark-browed forts on cliff and highland Guard the flower-bright gateways of her home, Still she needs to feel that round the island Thunder-bearing bulwarks guard the foam. Feb., 1896. A PRINCE'S RETURN (Lines Written on the Death of Prince Henry of Battenberg) I Over purple leagues of shadowy water, Heedless now of starshine or of storm, Watched and wept for by a Sovereign's daughter, Comes the relic of a princely form. Now from wave to wave in silence springing, Not with sounds of battle or of glee, Glides a lonely ghostlike vessel, bringing Fever's victim o'er the lonely sea. II Not for love of fame or lust of glory, Not to gain an earthly conqueror's crown, Not to win a name superb in story, Was this Prince's gentle life laid down. Just to show that he was one with others, One with England in her every strife, One in spirit with his soldier-brothers, Keen to share their labours and their life. III Therefore hath he won a name undying In the conquering annals of our race: He who, watching for the spear-storm flying, Met a grimmer foeman face to face. This the lesson—that through sternest trial Flashes forth the light of high deeds done; That, in all heroic self-denial, Princes, people, and the Throne, are one. Feb. 2, 1896. PHANTOM LOVES All have heard the grim old legend of the ship that ever sailed Round the Cape, for ever baffled, labouring on though nought availed; Ghostly bark that ever struggled through the wild encircling deep, Phantom sails that flashed on sailors startled from their midnight sleep. Sudden, through the pitchy darkness loomed the great ship—gaunt it gleamed Guided by the death-pale pilot, when the lurid lightning beamed: For one moment there it glittered—then it vanished in the gloom, Working out through nights eternal its eternity of doom. More tremendous, yet more solemn, is the doom some spirits bear Seeking, seeking, ever seeking, through the fragrant summer air, Through the sombre nights of winter, through the storm-tossed autumn days, Love and passion that evade them—as that ship was lost in haze. “Now at last”—the spirit murmurs—“now at last a love is mine Wholly pure and wholly tender, wholly sweet and all divine: Now at last”—the spirit dreameth—“I shall close this weary quest, Quit the hell of ceaseless travail, win the heaven of endless rest. “Now I love, and for the last time—Nay, I never loved before! Never made the silver sea-waves such sweet music on the shore! Never whiteness in the lily, never splendour in the rose, Gleamed so rich and so translucent—I have won love's deep repose.” But the noble hope is shattered. When love's joy is once attained What becomes of all its sweetness, what of lasting peace is gained? —As the ship toiled on for ever, so must man: his course must be On from passion unto passion, on from sea to sailless sea. Yes, the rose again can glitter, and the lily again can gleam Richer, whiter far than ever through the lost love's tender dream: For each new love is as Venus—at her touch the ocean glows Far more sapphire-waved than ever, lovelier ruby stains the rose. “I was born to give you pleasure”—so the new lips, tender, say: “Love me, court me, win me, wear me, though it be but for a day. I am Venus, I am Sappho, I am all the past in one; I can bring you the lost moon-rays! I can reillume the sun! “All the past is just as nothing, for the future have no care: Dream of one thing, only one thing—Am I young, love? am I fair? I am young and fair, thou sayest? Then let all the world repine, Let the wind through dark leaves murmur—What of that, if I am thine?” But the new love is a phantom, just a ghost—it passes too, And the flowers no more are radiant, and the sea no more is blue. All the soul of man is darkened; hurling hate against the sun It exclaims, “No heart has loved me, nought of love my life hath won!” So, the pale ghost-love pursuing, man goes on from hour to hour,— Wins no fruit of any passion, hardly wins one golden flower: Till at last his true love finds him—but her strange eyes flash with doom; Undivorced are they for ever who join hands within the tomb. ENGLAND AND ART I While in England, here enisled in sweetness, Year by year the girl-soft spirit of Spring Weaves her primrose-crown to pure completeness, Mixing silver stars the wood-nymphs bring; While o'er daisied vale and cowslipped hollow Year by year the white-fleeced clouds float by, There are those who seeking for Apollo Seek in vain, and deem that song must die. II There are those who deem the land grows olden; That the fields War's footsteps never trod, Blossom-gilded, wait in vain the golden Footprint of a more triumphant god. There are those who, rancorous grown and jealous, Ever-envious, mocking from afar, Longing loud to curse us, haste to tell us How our sun hath dwindled to a star! III Win a world-wide empire—overstep it By a yard, and surely thou shalt fall, Aged as in a moment, changed, decrepit, Ready sport, apt stalking-horse for all! So the hostile thousands clamour, burning, While their myriad dogs' tongues drip with foam, Soon to see oblivion's cataracts spurning England to the depths that buried Rome. Feb. 3, 1896. A SILVER WEDDING October 2, 1872: October 2, 1897 With joy and sadness strangely, sweetly, blended We hail, my wife, the silver-shining morn That sees so many joys and sorrows ended; White-winged precursor of the days unborn. In speedy concourse, thoughts throng round us flinging Aside the mantles of the buried days. All live again: old flower-wreathed springs come singing And risen summers perfume woodland ways. Again we watch the purple mountains, dreaming That Wordsworth still their secret heart divines: Again we see the cataract silver-gleaming That leaps for evermore through Southey's lines. Again white Paris spreads her streets before us, Her palaced glories, arched cathedral glooms. The sky of sunny friendly France smiles o'er us, A land for us of well-loved worshipped tombs. For there at Boulogne, where in grey completeness The rampart looks towards Paris or the sea, There lived long since in girlhood's simple sweetness The mother whose young life formed part of me. There too the brothers who with love most tender Watched o'er my youth, in far-off golden hours Plucked 'mid the corn the poppy's crimson splendour And wove their boyhood's wreath of perfect flowers. We have not journeyed far or much, wide-wandering; We know not scents down Indian valleys blown: We have not stemmed the Nile's brown eddies, pondering, Or gazed at Athens on her timeless throne. But we have seen the Bernhardt's glances lighten, Marked Art wax prouder, as her genius grew; Watched her firm fingers round the dagger tighten And watched that white hand redden as it slew. And we have trodden old shadowy paths together, Heard through “Milady's” lips the serpents hiss, And loved those sunniest hearts in blackest weather, D'Artagnan, Porthos, Athos, Aramis. Year after year at wind-kissed sea-stormed Brighton We, studying heaven and sea with earnest eyes, Have watched the crests of green-blue billows whiten And watched God paint new sunsets in his skies. Year after year, returning to the city Whose turrets seek the blue through smoke-wreaths rent, We have felt our hearts go out in unfeigned pity Towards those within the smokeless country pent. For ever thought has star-crowned heaven for neighbour And thought steals stars from heaven, and with them crowns The tireless brows that ever muse and labour Not in the country, in the flowerless towns. Here in old London year by year retiring Has seen prayers answered, problems that depart: We both have laboured,—you my thought inspiring, I setting thought's raw gold in frame of Art. And ever through the past's now mist-wreathed portal Visions of pleasures shared together shine: Delights that youth's keen senses made immortal And love made tenderer by his touch divine. On Dover's heights we chase the “clouded yellows,” Mocked still by many a winged and jewelled form: In Balcombe orchards the red apple mellows; Broad Sussex charms us under sun or storm. Again, as often and often by me sitting At Lord's, you watch the rival school-teams play; Mark with a thrill the Dark Blue's marvellous hitting And see triumphant Harrow win the day. Again, on many a night of swift emotion We see some strong great drama aptly done; Believe in canvas swaying like the ocean, And paper moons, and simulated sun. And Mulgrave once again with magic finger Touches to gold its dark trees' aging locks: Beside the strange old ruin again we linger; Again the sea-flowers gem the tide-washed rocks. Again we leap the stream that seeks the ocean At Robin Hood's, the immortal outlaw's, Bay: We leap; but still I have a lurking notion One cleared the stream—the other stopped half-way! The sea-gulls that we shot,—or missed them, was it? The thyme-sweet cliffs we climbed, the jokes that sped! The sun that, laughing, bent down to deposit Gold, countless gold, upon your crownless head! The moon and stars that kissed the silvered billows; The peace at night upon the stormless deep: Old Oxford's towers, and blue waves under willows, And meadows where youth's flower-crowned fancies sleep. All these we saw and loved. We worshipped Mary, Her whom each poet dreading, yet adores: Murderess divine, half tigress heart, half fairy, Whose ghost at Holyrood spurns the blood-stained floors. We stole, yes stole, bright daffodils, not knowing The crowned slim beauties were but fostered slaves. We deemed the sun had set them all a-blowing, The free wind kissed them into yellow waves! We watched the Thames, a streak of silver lying Beneath the windy firs of Abbey Wood; Across waste moors saw many a sunset dying: On Scarboro's castled storm-blown crags we stood. And through it all the sense of pure devotion, Of wifely love, thrilled ever my young heart; Adding a splendour to the moonlit ocean, Adding a glory to all crowns of Art. Yes: if I, fervid, sought the poet's laurel, Remember, for your sake I largely sought; That to your feet past question, doubt or quarrel, The world turned suppliant might at last be brought. Time spurred the lagging years: we hardly noted, For love arrests life's steeds upon their road. We walked and drove, and climbed bright downs, and boated, And drew strange fishes from their green abode. We hurled o'er ocean meads the flashing cobble, The dark-winged fairy of the North Coast fleet; Her in whose wake the swiftest wild waves hobble, Pursuing vainly with white spray-splashed feet. We knew and loved the sun-burned North Coast sailors: Ah! still true faces on my memory gleam. Alas! Death's prison, where none may bribe the gaolers, Holds many of whom our lingering thoughts would dream. Ah! when upon our race we gaily started, Youth's sunshine glittering on your golden head, How many loving souls, divine, great-hearted, Smiling, beheld us start. The most are dead. How many watched us then! what loving faces, What friendly eyes, what hearts who wished our good. But five and twenty years thin crowded places, As surely as storm-winds thin the gold-leafed wood. They wished us well; they wish us well, it may be: They watched us start; they watch us touch this goal. Glad let our five and twentieth wedding-day be! For five and twenty years wed soul to soul. FAREWELL: SIX SONNETS (1897) SONNET I “ALONE WITH TRUTH” Through all life's early hours when sunshine fell In golden floods across the dawn-bright way, One spirit held a hundred foes at bay And ever cried: “I fear not. All is well.” But soon a thousand of the hosts of hell Sprang forth, and joined the blood-streaked first array And sought with serried phalanx to dismay Yet stormed not that one soul's stern citadel. Then came the night,—first gay with many a star Flung like wild jewels o'er heaven's velvet-blue, Next ever lonelier, as they faded far, Till pitchy black the gemless dim vault grew: Still the man fought, though hope's foot followed youth, Alone in darkness, but alone with truth. SONNET II THE ROSE O sacred flower whose marvellous fragrance, blent With our grey planet's golden-haired first dream, Added strange magic to the first moon-beam That watched our world's first lovers' deep content; O flower, within whose luscious petals pent Lurks as a prisoner woman's kiss I deem, Above thy sweet abyss of scent I seem To linger, as over Eve's lips Adam leant. Oh may I, when my pale gaze fronts the night Amid whose blackness blind Death reaps and sows Groping with bloodless wrists and fingers white, Take with me to the land that no man knows Memories of zoneless passion's wild delight Mixed with thy fragrance, never-dying rose! SONNET III ONE GODDESS Ever, through darkness and unmeasured gloom, When after soft arms' scent and warm embrace I meet the eyeless mute deliberate face That waits and threatens where no bounteous bloom Of summer fills the fields no suns illume, May I bear with me to the joyless place Eternal dreams of one white goddess' grace Whom I have served,—and will serve to the tomb. For she the queen, when once her lips have smiled, Forbids the soul she smiles on ever to flee: She lures him as the flowers' smile lures a child And sways him with most flowerlike sovereignty; She who first sprang from wavelets undefiled, Moulded of rose-bloom and the foam-white sea. SONNET IV ÉMILE ZOLA Right glad am I that in this sunless spot Some call the world, some heaven, some grimmest hell, One man has left in falsehood's citadel Ass Custom's foul old shapeless form to rot, Then pointed out what is, and what is not, In words that through the centuries still will tell Till all men own that what is true is well To speak, to read, without one blank or blot. Right glad am I that, in this world of lies, Where rough worth fails and polished fraud succeeds And brazen-browed imposture fronts the skies While on right's forehead the fierce thorn-crown bleeds, One man at least has dared to seek the prize, Eternal truth beyond all gods and creeds. SONNET V “O SPIRIT OF TRUTH” O Spirit of Truth, one with the eternal sea, The scent of summer flowers, the golden sun, Remember, now my task is well nigh done, I fought and suffered for the love of thee! I spurned the glittering crowns by falsehood won And watched the rose-wreathed hopes spread wings and flee. Wilt thou, O Spirit of Truth, not fight for me Who fought for thee, when champion thou hadst none? Lift me beyond this ceaseless herd of liars Into calm meadows by great spirits trod, Where noble acts are one with high desires: This world weighs on me like a leaden load: To thee, to thee alone my soul aspires, For thine eyes ever watch the eyes of God. SONNET VI FOR A DREAM The fiftieth hour has struck!—I know that soon I part for ever with the strength of youth. But I part never with the love of truth Nor with the love of woman, and of June. I loved the rose at morn, I loved at noon The rose with heavenlier tints, at close of day I loved the rose, and till my locks grew grey Gave all I had to Beauty for a boon. My song, my toil, my life, my heart I gave: I worshipped Beauty with a love supreme; I saw her blue eyes in the summer wave And kissed her fragrant white limbs in a dream And, longing ever that sweet dream to save, Lost for its sake all prizes men esteem. THE LIFE ETERNAL SONNET Woman must bring to man the life of flowers Within her lips and ever-fragrant hair, And all the sweetness of the summer air That breathes from heavenly shores and mystic bowers. She makes this earth the abode of unknown powers That stoop from heaven, the soul of man to bear Upward, if he will hearken and prepare To build on earth the golden deathless towers. White with the glory of the breast of God, Scented from fields no foot of man has trod, She gives herself, a stainless being, to earth. Without her sweet vicarious subtle grace No man can meet God's sweetness face to face Nor know regenerate joys of heavenly birth. 1901. THE LATE BISHOP OF DURHAM SONNET A great soul gone! Through many a long hard day He fought for God and England. Many a soul He led to Christ's beneficent control: His heart grew tenderer, as his hair waxed grey. Yet not to me the Durham towers convey His inmost spirit's thought. My heart goes back And gathers blossoms on that earlier track Where Harrow fields watch Harrow toil and play. There first I knew and loved,—to know was ever To love,—the soul of Westcott, most divine When most he stooped, with manliest pure endeavour To lead the thoughts of boyhood line by line Along the road of faith. Death cannot sever The golden thread that links his heart to mine. July 29, 1901. LEADERLESS SONNET What hope for England, if no man be found With brain to succour, and with strength to lead? Earth yet may witness, if no soul gives heed, A once Imperial race debased, discrowned. To widen Empire to earth's furthest bound Is not to rule, to triumph, to succeed. We fought for Freedom? Nay, we fought for greed. Wild lust for gold runs noblest states aground. On Empire's giddiest height to-day we stand: Who climbs so hugely wins the whole world's hate: One false step hurls from heaven to deepest hell. Yet, careless, strolling onward hand in hand, Our youths and maidens throng round Pleasure's gate, And our grey statesmen murmur, “All is well.” July 30, 1901. AUGUST, 1901 SONNET At home a war of voices never still; No leader found, no sane or clear desire; Not even passion that with fierce wild fire If it destroys, at the very least can thrill. Abroad, the immense black hatred that would kill, Had it the power, all souls that yet aspire. No strong note sounded, save from Watson's lyre: No singleness of heart, or brain, or will. What hope in this? What hope save still to grasp The one great thought that raised us heretofore And placed an Empire's crown within our hands And all life's fairest jewels in our clasp— That Freedom's foot should range from shore to shore And Love lift up her gaze from subject lands. ENGLAND'S CHOICE Thou art in peril greater than thou deemest, O England! What if trial-hours are o'er? How were it if, while blind and drugged, thou dreamest, Thy moment came,—then passed for evermore? Here, 'mid our island's flowers, our songs and laughter, Peace dwells, thou thinkest, calm-eyed in the sun. Yet what if War sprang forth, and Hell leaped after? If days destroyed what centuries have won? Each warrior, wasted in a worthless quarrel, Means one sword less when England's strife begins. We fling our manhood down, defile Fame's laurel, And deem the blindest heart the heart that wins. Who shall atone for countless corpses, rotten On those far plains that England's blood makes red? Whose was the heart, by Justice unforgotten, That planned the crime? What say the maimed, the dead? Lo! through the darkness, awful and abiding, Strange ghosts come floating, gaunt-eyed in the gloom: White ghosts of children, through the black night gliding, And ghosts of mothers, pallid from the tomb. Our women, here, despairing and divided, Know not which way to turn, what side to take. Our statesmen palter. Truth wrings hands, derided. Love wails in heaven, and hearts God moulded break. A moment yet thou hast. Behold life's portal That love guards ever and the stars illume. England! thou mayest choose the gate immortal. The world's whole future turns upon thy doom. But here in England still the roses blossom, Yea, still they watch God's gaze within the sun; And still man's head may rest on woman's bosom In peace, and still love's rapture may be won. Still in our homes the wife may sleep securely, Her calm head pillowed on her husband's breast: The lips of love, untinged by blood and purely, On lips that shudder not may softly rest. Bright girls, with heaven's own light within their glances, Move through the meadows, through the tranquil towns: Not in our streets harsh loveless War advances With touch that soils, dismays, pollutes, discrowns. Here friends are summoned not to watch with terror That seeks the throne of God in anguish grim Friends murdered; friends who fought in grief, in error, Seeing Freedom's face in vision wild or dim. No mother, bound, sees Death with hideous pleasure Hugging in murderous clasp some child's gold head. Night falls in calm on England. All we treasure Sleeps safe. God's angels guard the marriage-bed. Safe—safe—with God to watch and Love to cherish! Who shall express the ecstasy supreme Of knowing that here our loved ones cannot perish? We wake not, shrieking, from some hellish dream. We see not, we, a loved home's beam and rafter Sink, as the tossing flames win closer hold. Here, still, we catch the ring of children's laughter: There, children's bloodless lips grow grey and cold. Art smiles in England. Night by night we follow In many a gilded bright theatric fane Art's steps. Our budding poets court Apollo Or worship Venus in some listless strain. Yet is there work to do. While Mars, grim, tearless, Red-browed, red-sworded, fiercely stalks along, We need a soul of fire, a singer fearless; We need in truth an iron-hearted song. We need the soul of Hugo here, to point us Towards courage higher than cult of swords and guns. We need a holier chrism to anoint us Than that which from the gaping red wound runs. We need to know that round our island rally Vast angel-armies who can hold their own Against the world, though all the world should sally Against their well-loved sea-beat island throne. Can hold their own—though countless cannon thundered, Through our strong help, our women's pure-souled power. England is lost, if we from heaven are sundered: Alone, our might would wither in an hour. Each English flower is linked to some flower-spirit, Each English girl to some bright angel-form. Through woman we the inmost heavens inherit And take the palace of the skies by storm. If England's heart be pure, with clearest laughter The far-off future she may face indeed, Win from the present a superb hereafter; If love be hers in practice as in creed. But, if the nobler heart of woman fail us, The enclosing angel-hosts will fail as well. They cannot stem the huge hosts that assail us, Hosts numbering myriads trained in darkest hell; They cannot guard our country's golden portal, They cannot shield one English girl or flower If we will summon not their aid immortal And link with theirs our own incorporate power. The power of England reaches to far regions; We may claim boldly, count on as our own, The force of angel-hosts, the might of legions Whose spotless armour flashes round God's throne. 1901 “THROUGH WOMAN” TWO SONNETS I. Through woman still the eternal God-power pours Its wealth of passion and its glory of form. God's breast is in the white breast, sweet and warm, And subtle flower-scents from far heavenly shores That who inhales in rapturous trance adores. The impassioned sense of “conjugal repose” God only, being perfect sex-God, knows And gives to man from his exhaustless stores. Dim-seen religions of ancestral lands Erring, it may be, none the less were nearer In this to God's heart, and the truth proclaimed With vision larger and with voice far clearer: God's own Bride's soft touch thrills through woman's hands And through her eyes the deathless glance has flamed. II. Man, over-coarse and gross of heart and head, Can only lust, or love with slight thin flame. He knows not that all blossoms' fragrance came, Yea, every scent of rose of white or red Or tender breath of lily's gold-crowned head, Straight from the bloom of God's own Bride. Oh, shame On creeds that mock at woman's love, and claim Life, when they grope amid their countless dead. This is the message that has yet to come Flinging new light across the sea and land, The fragrant gospel hidden in woman's bloom; The blossom-perfumed message of her hand Sent forth by God to open every tomb For him who hath the soul to understand. July 30, 1901. “GOD'S HOLIEST SHRINE” SONNET Through woman's body of beauty and of grace, Through this, this only, man can reach the fair Soft robe of fragrance that the meadows wear And kiss the sweetness of the morning's face. God's Bride, the universe, will stoop to place If man be willing, if he nobly dare, Her wealth unending in his hands. The hair We worship thrills no spirit lewd or base. The infinite sweetness of the body of earth, Of stars, of planets countless and divine, Alone through woman's sweetness can be won. Man, with a vast unutterable mirth, This winning, wins the glory of the sun And, sun-crowned, worships in God's holiest shrine. July 30, 1901. “THE DREAM THAT WE BEHELD” The dream that we beheld will never more On mortal wondering dazzled eyes descend. The sea, less jewelled, will break along the shore: Love's voice with music will less softly blend. The rose will veil its splendour when we die. “Something there was within its tender bloom” Each loving heart may say, “which, living, I, I only, saw,—that ceases at my tomb.” And woman? Did not one soul find her fair Beyond all mortals who have lived and died? Breathe all heaven's fragrance in her marvellous hair? Touch in her breast the softness of God's Bride? July 31, 1901. “THE SOUL'S EMBRACE” SONNET Who lives not in the heart of woman, lives In God's heart never, though the hand may press God's hand. Who knows not the divine caress Knows not the holiest rapture God's touch gives. Who wills to win the most, the most receives: Who never knew the glory of a rose Full little of God's inmost glory knows Or of the height of rapture love achieves. In holiest pureness seek the kiss divine: Make all its perfect subtle fragrance thine: Find God revealed in woman's wondrous face. Did God make woman for a temptress? Nay, He moulded neck and bosom to convey To man the sweetness of the soul's embrace. July 31, 1901. “LOST PARADISE” SONNET Cleansed by the embrace of woman, man may meet Fearless the glances of the imperial sun. The thrones of golden starland may be won And all the souls of blossoms pure and sweet May mix their delicate scents and softly fleet Throughout the inmost fleshly frame of one In whom a marvellous mystic work is done By Her whose lips impassioned angels greet. Pure from the arms of woman, man obtains Right to the rapture of the Summer's breast And in his arms the Summer's children rest, Even all the blossoms of the hills and lanes. Saved through the touch of woman, man regains Lost Paradise, and his whole body is blest. July 31, 1901. “THE ASTRAL BODY” TWO SONNETS I. The astral body rests within our own And sometimes flashes through the outer folds. All things it rules, all matter's forms it moulds; The earth is unto it subservient throne. Through its pure flesh the scents of flowers unknown Can travel,—yea, it gathers from the flowers Their sweetness, and in love's embrace it showers Their fragrance on the form its kisses crown. There are who even on this earth of ours The pure eternal spirit-form have won, The risen form as radiant as the sun And gifted with unfathomable powers,— The form that every blossom of earth's bowers Builds up, from soft bloom-atoms woven and spun. II. This is why woman with her subtle grace, Her robe of tenderest flesh, in this our day Hath gained the power to gather and convey So strange a mystic sweetness,—not of face Alone, but rather memories of some place Beyond the stars, beyond the sun's red ray, Beyond blue ocean, regions far away That hold dim records of another race. The angel-form within her form revives: The old strange beauty now at last returns, The scent of Eden's roses, Eden's ferns, The clear remembrance of forgotten lives. Aye, while man marvels, victory arrives And Eden's light through the old tree-vistas burns. July 31, 1901. “WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE WORTH OF THINGS” I We cannot estimate the worth of things That once seemed small. The value of a rose With red-lipped beauty and with fragrant wings, One spirit, the spirit that watched it fading, knows. II We cannot tell what rapture we may miss Who lightly lose what once was nobly won. God's heart was given in some dead woman's kiss. One tiny shipwrecked star may wreck the sun. III The child can live without the poet's heart That loved the little face through which heaven smiled. Ah me! my soul is lost, thus rent apart: The poet cannot live without the child. July 31, 1901. LINES WRITTEN BY ONE GRADUALLY GROWING BLIND The world, the world, God's lovely world Is fading out of sight! The great cloud-ships with sails unfurled, Great sails of snowiest white. The skies of blue, the forests green, That I have loved, God knows: The crimson deep triumphant sheen Of summer's stateliest rose. The purple violet's modest hue; The lily's silver crown: My sea's wild waves of magic blue; The light on field and down. To see these things no more, no more,— O agony supreme! To feel that life is o'er, is o'er; To pass into a dream. But, most of all, to leave unmet By mine the eyes of thee, Dear wife,—the eyes that never yet Turned once away from me. This is the haunting horror, this Must wreck at last the brain: The sweetness in thy look to miss Is hell's intensest pain. Aug. 1, 1901.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. X SONNETS (1870-1882) SONNET I BEAUTY'S SPLENDOUR For those who once have marvelled at her splendour And known it no alternative remains,— For ever doomed to suffer endless pains, Or else in emptiness their souls surrender That Beauty in a vision may engender The new-born power of singing endless strains. A wave of mounting melody most tender From sweet rose-scented subtle mouth she rains Upon them: they must echo it, or never Win rest, or cushioned couch, or conscious ease; Their souls from Beauty they will not dissever; The stern-eyed Goddess they cannot appease Save by a manful choice to sing for ever All that, and nothing save what, she shall please. 1870. SONNET II THE LOVE OF THE FUTURE The loves of men as yet are icy floes, Imperfect, shapeless, in tumultuous motion, Rolled aimlessly about the mad mid-ocean: With shocks that shatter and with blinding blows, Heart-pangs of agony, convulsive throes, Abandonment of being, death-devotion, A death that strangles every previous notion, Harmoniously the glittering ice-berg rose. I stand beyond the future, and I see Rise passion-pinnacled the crystal palace, Awful with unimagined purity; A frozen rainbow, an inverted chalice, A dream-encircled dream of what shall be When labourer love has drained the world of malice. 1870. SONNET III CONFESSION OF MY FAITH I. Love, thou art sweet, but thou art not for me: Only to love thee more than other men Is mine, a fleeting vision now and then Of garments passing rapidly to see, But never in thine arms alas! to be, Never to hold thee in a close embrace And only see the eyes and not the face, So near that all things else are forced to flee Save the expression of the life—to die Ten thousand deaths ecstatic in a kiss, Low at annihilation's feet to lie Unconscious in abandonment of bliss— The lovers who are capable of this By fate are left for loss of it to sigh. 1870. SONNET IV CONFESSION OF MY FAITH II. Love crowns the careless men who seek her not With hand capricious, but she leaveth those Who loyally the first her service chose With tears the path of every day to blot; She leaveth them, it seemeth, quite forgot; The current of her favour onward flows And over heads of former victims goes In haste to fertilize some other spot. But, O my brothers, let us yet be true, And though she slays us, gives us no relief, Yet notwithstanding let us be the chief Of those who on the earth are found to do Her work, and prominently bring to view The lineaments that smite us low with grief. 1870. SONNET V THE CHASE OF BEAUTY We follow her fast, we follow her through the gloom, We follow her through the gladsome glare of day, And through the evening shadows sad we stray, We are ready to follow her even to the tomb If only light of eyes of hers may loom From out the dark and dance across the way Paved with the bones of poet-heroes—they Whose hearts the passionate constant fires consume. We follow her hard—she glances round at times, But once or twice in a thousand years or so, And sets some singer's being in a glow, And burns from out his soul a rage of rhymes That ring perhaps some twenty centuries' chimes And through the mouths of men for ages go. 1870. SONNET VI THE PURPLE WINGS If on my shoulders never shall be seen The puissant purple fluttering of the wings Wherewith the poet beateth as he sings The high celestial atmospheric sheen, If I may never say the thing I mean, And only half an ear my audience brings, And misdirected are my ambitious slings, And no Goliath blazing eyes between My stone hits full—at least she lets me die, Queen Beauty, as my gentle brother died Who lies on the Italian mountain-side, In one long passion of an outpoured sigh That seemeth tremblingly to wonder why The kiss of satisfaction is denied. 1870. SONNET VII THE WAKING OF BEAUTY Take courage, friends, for she hath but been sleeping These eighteen centuries underneath the snow; She whom we loved and worshipped long ago In Hellas, for whose face we have been weeping, And long look-out the sons of men are keeping, Shall burn upon us with her early glow Of sweetest rosy gladness; we shall know Her resurrection—we who have been reaping The bitter harvest of her absent shame. From end to end of our awakened earth Shall roll upon the wings of morning mirth The great reverberation of her name, And she shall rule the ages, she the same To whom the foam of Grecian waves gave birth. 1870. SONNET VIII POESY I. Sweet Poesy, I love thee; as a bride Plays with a lover's locks and crowns his hair With kisses, finding him exceeding fair, So do thou prattle, sweet one, by my side, And let me on thy gentle converse glide As softly as a swallow on the air; Be kind to me, let me some secrets share; Thou knowest for how long my soul hath sighed After thy Beauty, shall I not attain One day the inner vision of thy face? Are all a poet's passionate pleadings vain? —I care for nothing else if but thy grace Be present, making summer of each place, Wringing a melody out of every pain. 1870. SONNET IX POESY II. Let us be joinéd hand in hand and go Along the secret dim mysterious shore Where wave succeedeth wave for evermore, Each following each with an incessant flow Of music most bewitching,—let us row Beside strange banks with a half-sleepy oar Under a moon of magic, and explore The world together, say, shall it be so? The glamour of the mornings and the nights Of sacred summer we will make our own, My Poesy,—the laughter of the dawn, The music from the heart of midday drawn, All lusty loves ecstatic and delights, And, best of all for me, thy silvery tone! 1870. SONNET X “PRAISE BEAUTY!” I. Praise Beauty! So say I—although the seas Of loss of being choke the effort down, And universes armed against me frown, I stand upright and speak the thing I please, Not bending feeble supplication knees To any petty bully of the town, Be he philosopher or sage or clown, Whether his glances petrify or freeze. Praise Beauty! and if Beauty loves me not, And never on my brow may cool be laid Aught sweeter than the sorry cypress shade, Nor pointed tips of bay-leaves touch the spot With inward brain-desires and panting hot, Yet unto Beauty be my tribute paid! 1870. SONNET XI “PRAISE BEAUTY!” II. Ah! sweet one, why thus lure us on by day, And send us flying phantom dreams by night That lips may smart for unattained delight? Why, treacherous, teach our vehement tongues to pray Just to annihilate us with a “Nay,” A cold still countenance after smiles so bright? Sweet, thou wast rosy once, why now be white? Thou who didst hasten towards us, why delay? Why tarry thus the backward lingering wheels Of Beauty's chariot harnessed to the sun, And swift by rights as dawn's approach begun, Or echoes following hard triumphant peals When all the brain brimful of rapture reels With melodies that beat and burst and stun? 1870. SONNET XII THE ROSE OF NIGHT “She kept me awake, as a tune of Mozart's might do.” —Keats And she kept me awake, but not the same The vision, or the phantasy of sound That kept my sleepless senses still unbound And all my heart encircled by a flame, But rather as if some splendid flower came Waving a magic mist of perfume round, And occupied my being itself, and wound About me with a most imperious claim, Coloured as is a choice kaleidoscope; And ever and anon the clouds would rise, And, as a moon, would beam before my eyes That, far from closing, ever wider ope, The form that to the craving clasp of hope Pursuing, she retreating still denies. 1871. SONNET XIII A HORROR AND A CALM “Sweet, gather me some clover”—and he stepped Over the stile into the crimson field, And she with a green hedge behind for shield Leaned back and waited, dreamed and smiled and slept, The while he wandered onward far, and leapt To seize another flower fairer still; But, on a sudden, came a cold sharp thrill Across him, and a horror grew and crept With slimy sickening feet throughout his brain, The sense that she was gone—he hurried back, And let the grasses fall upon the track, And with his eyes stretched wide in eager pain Met—that full tender hazel glance again! Of flowers of love they did not find a lack. 1871. SONNET XIV A MARRIAGE PRAYER O tender Mother on high that hast the four Clear winds for breath, be gracious unto these; That hers may mix the savour of the seas Of Italy, and scents from every shore Thy sweet South West wind sweeps her odours o'er; That his may bear the banners of the breeze That rides where the pure keen blue glaciers freeze And Alpine heights ascend for evermore. O Mother, mingle in their meeting breath Thine own soul gathered from the East and West And North and South, and extreme peaks of death And passes of new life,—and bare thy breast That either soul may nestle safe therein, And let its melted snow-wreaths cleanse from sin. 1871. SONNET XV LOVE'S RELIEF Each rain-shower is an evidence to the air Of the relief of heaven, and each storm Of sobs the pressure of God's bosom warm,— A token sent our spirits to prepare For a closer tenderness, a joy more rare, A weeping purer and more clear and sweet, Deliverance after yet more fervent heat, A trouble greater than our souls could bear. Just as a husband weeps upon the breast Of his wife, and in that holy shower of rain The thunder-clouds and copper skies of pain Expand, and sob their terror into rest, Till he sleeps as calmly in that quiet nest As a child who wakes to smile and sleep again. 1871. SONNET XVI THINE HANDS Thine hands do smite me like the perfect chords Of music, every finger brings a tune; They draw me like the drawing of the moon, They thrill my heart like beautiful sharp swords, Or as God's sweet unerring touch rewards His heroes; they pervade me like a stream Of honeyed influence, or as a dream The milk-white bosom of the night affords. Oh, that my heaven may be the ceaseless rain Of swords and soft flowers clustered in thy hands, Or as the ceaseless music that expands From these, the founts of music, when they strain Above me, touching me; and do retain The sweetness of the women of all lands. 1873. SONNET XVII WHITE AND BLACK A most sweet vision holds my spirit now, And Music adds its magic (for before My dreams were silent as a moonless shore At midnight, or a vessel's midnight prow). Over a woman's stately marble brow A pure cascade of coal-black hair doth pour:— The black-brown tresses that I loved of yore, Darkened by contrast of her body of snow. Ah! lady, goddess, is it not enough To overcome me with thy body of white Surrounded with that mist of tresses black, As the moon rides serene upon the rough Dark breakers of invulnerable night?— Must eyes and fiery mouth pursue my track? 1873. SONNET XVIII YEARNING AND ITS MUSIC-ANSWER I. The Beauty of Woman Who shall possess the whole of any flower,— Both petals, leaves, and fragrance that abides In the sweet golden core where God resides, Casting that fragrance forth with lavish power? Man doth possess a woman for an hour:— Upon her ample bosom's roseate tides Softly and sweetly for a month he rides; Then winter shakes the rose-leaves from his bower. How shall we grasp in one excessive bliss The beauty and fragrance that the world has seen, Even from the rose-red blossom of Eve's kiss To the rare laughter of the Egyptian queen, Enclosing, sacred shuddering palms atween, The imperial pure significance of this? 1874. SONNET XIX YEARNING AND ITS MUSIC-ANSWER II. The Musical Blending There is a love beyond the love we hold In earthly grasp of over-eager hand,— A love that bloometh in another land, With petals of divine untarnished gold. When from the shuddering organ notes are rolled Conveying hints we fail to understand, Or when with slender moonlight on the sand A distant horn blends pæans clear and bold:— When music at these seasons wakes in us Some glimpse of evanescent heavenly fire, We learn that love is consummated thus! Yea, woman's hands in heaven are a lyre, And all her snow-white body a stream of sound Whereby we are caught; close-chained, caressed, close-bound. 1874. SONNET XX PSYCHE'S ZONE As Love bestowed on Psyche a bright snake To twist in belted beauty round her waist, That so she might be kept for ever chaste, And every prying hand might tremble and shake,— So have I given my Lady a zone to take And round her beating side to wind and clasp; A rustling girdle of song doth grip and grasp The far-off heart that quivers for song's sake. Intrude not, any wandering lover, lest This serpent that around her body fair In tortuous coils of gleaming colours hangs Should strike you with irreparable fangs:— Leave unto me her snow-white body and breast; Leave unto me her red lips and brown hair. 1874. SONNET XXI PURSUIT AND CAPTURE Is there a sweeter thing than when one feels The breast of Love brought closely to one's own, So that each sigh or softly-murmured moan Is caught and changed to laughter's silver peals? Yea, this is sweeter—that the world conceals No love for ever, though she flee away Through woods and endless forests fierce and grey; Beware! the avenging Love is at thine heels. In some sequestered glade of that wild wood The pale pursuer is upon thee, sweet; Love's angered advent thou shalt not elude,— Turn rather, soft-eyed, that approach to meet! He treadeth after thee with footstep rude, And pauseth not for poisonous swamps, or heat. 1874. SONNET XXII AN EMBODIED MUSIC Thou art indeed the very spirit of song: Thou art in truth the essence of fair sound. All chants upon thy rose-red lips abound; When thou dost speak, it is as music strong And sweet and clear: I hear one dream-tune long Whene'er I hear, see, worship, watch for thee,— The spirit of gracious speech descends on me, And through me thoughts float, in one white-winged throng. O lady fair, thou art the spirit of singing; A sweet embodied music,—nought besides. Lo! through thy white white body the pure tides Of universal sound are softly ringing, Delighting, dazzling, changing fast, and bringing My soul towards some fair rest that God provides. 1876. SONNET XXIII “THOU SHALT DRAW ME” Thou shalt draw me: it shall be changed at last. I am the stronger now—I have to draw Thy soul by some magnetic simple law Towards mine, till every idol is downcast. Then when thy spirit is wholly free from flaw, Thou shalt draw me; my work will then be past: Thou shalt allure by thine own yearning vast My spirit; and it shall follow, pale with awe. My ecstasy shall then at last begin,— My cup of glorious pleasure shall be full,— As into silver waters soft and cool That purge with many a lovely surge from sin I joyous then shall plunge: thy great desire Shall clothe me, as in measureless white fire. 1876. SONNET XXIV DAY BY DAY As day by day the void doth greater grow Between thee and the world, 'tween thee and friends; As life's wide wintry landscape now extends Before thee, its chill meadows deep with snow; As, silently, thou pacest to and fro, Revolving in thy spirit silent ends; As over thee the eternal azure bends, Like love's skies stooping o'er thee long ago; When things are thus,—when thou dost yearn to hear Some word from thine own country, where the air Of softest love once lifted thy brown hair, Some note of recompence, some sound of cheer,— Remember then that, in Art's sunny lands, Thou hast for ever one who understands. 1876. SONNET XXV “GRECIAN AND ENGLISH” Am I a pagan? Am I set at nought Because I worship here in English air The goddess whom Keats' fancy found so fair,— The gold-haired Venus whom his genius brought Hither, sweet queen of songs and amorous thought? No more need blue-bell weep or rose despair: Though Greece she loved, she did not linger there; Drawn Westward ever, the land of Keats she sought. Her light of beauty is upon our hills: She haunts our Isis, and her soft eyes shine On sun-kissed ripples of our Northern rills, And her white limbs repose 'neath birch and pine, And our grey waves with marvellous foot she thrills, Grecian and English,—and as both divine. 1881. SONNET XXVI “ANGER IS OFTTIMES HOLY” Suggested by Keble's poem regretting the disuse of excommunication in the Church of England. “Il faut que le poëte, aux semences fécondes, Soit comme ces forêts vertes, fraîches, profondes, Pleines de chants, amour du vent et du rayon, Charmantes, où, soudain, l' on rencontre un lion.” Victor Hugo, Les Contemplations. Anger is ofttimes holy. Half the worth Of song lies in the singer's sudden sword, Along which burns the anger of the Lord To smite “the high priests and rulers” of the earth. A thing most holy was Elijah's mirth,— The awful mocking gibes his lips outpoured Midmost the palsied powerless priestly horde Who shrieked in vain round their stone altars' girth. Great anger at small anger is no crime: So when we open Keble's page and lo! We find a malediction in his rhyme And spite's stream foaming in weak overflow We volley back the curse of Man and Time, And render scourge for scourge and blow for blow. 1882. SONNET XXVII “BORN OUT OF DUE TIME” If I be born too late, and if for me Beside the sea-wave still white Venus stands With tenderest witchery in soft outstretched hands,— If still along the moonlight-dimpled sea I hear far sounds as of the silver glee Of sea-nymphs making for the weed-flecked strands,— If summer beckons me from balmier lands, Why must ye, O ye people, turn from me? Oh, worship ye your gods, and leave me mine! Think ye that never ripples shone so fair As those of Galilee? A sweeter air Trembles along the blue waves' creamy line And lifts the tresses of dark groves of pine Whereby the old gods' passionate temples were! 1882. SONNET XXVIII MY GIFT Ah! what gifts have I?—Here I try to sing: The roses mock at all my similes; The mavis, casting sweet notes on the breeze, Mocks me; the leafage mocks me in the spring, And the high eagle with triumphant wing Mocks me,—and the sheer music of the seas Mocks me, and the broad laughter of the trees And all the silvery mirth of everything. Yet one gift have I which I yield to none: One supreme sense which doth my being fill: One passionate instinct stronger than the sun: One changeless masterful marked bent of will:— The beauty of Woman doth my spirit thrill As never it thrilled a singer yet,—not one. 1882. ENGLAND AND PALESTINE O shores and lakes and dells Of England! asphodels And lilies of the East are not so fair As tender blossoms born Beneath the breath of morn Within your folds and nursed by Western air: Nor are the Eastern maids Crowned with the dim black braids As sweet as flowing crowns of sun-kissed golden hair. O England! cliffs and downs And bustling fervent towns And long grey shores and myriad-manéd sea, And gardens, close, red-walled, And mountains weird and bald And white-plumed torrents tossing o'er the lea And green sequestered nooks And pebbly trout-loved brooks— Give all your glory of soul, ye wild domains, to me! Crown me not with a hand Burnt red with sultry sand, But with the clear palm of an English maid; Stars that above us shine, O'er mountain-ash and pine, And fluctuant birch and tangled oak-tree's shade And silvery mute stream, Mix ye with my fond dream,— And flowers that flush in spring the English mossy glade. And English women fair, Sweet for the Northern air, Breathed as the English rose and white as high Lilies that round us stand, Stretch forth from all the land Hands lily-white and fragrant ere I die, And crown the English song That sweeps in tide-flood strong Across my eager heart and through my soul doth sigh. Oh, never yet avail Our songs that seek the pale And sunburnt maidens of the Eastern land; That leave the land of pines For weak low-growing vines: Never avail the feet that feebly stand Upon our sounding shores: Never avail the oars That shun the dark-blue deep, that strike against the sand. Grant me the perfect kiss Of England,—give me this, O time, O life, O death with down-bowed wings! I ask this; nothing more: One swift scent of the shore That the blue endless English ocean rings With ring of sweet white foam; One rosebud from my home, One flower whereto my hand in the death-grapple clings. One rustling heather-bell, One tuft of furze to smell, One woman's mouth, dearer than rose, to kiss; One vision, nothing more, Of limitless wide shore; One awful rush of music; only this: One breath of the bright sky Of England;—then I die Content, clasped in a wild unfathomable bliss. One wondrous London day, To watch the torrent play, The flood of life, along the murmuring shore Of endless seething streets; One with the heart that beats In giant pulses through them evermore: Then let the veil be rent And let me pass content The ever-rippling, waiting, yearning death-stream o'er. Crowned with my own sweet land, Her hand within my hand, Her eyes upon my eyes, her tender gaze Deeply intent on me, And all her wind-sweet sea Laughing as children laugh in primrose ways; Thus would I pass,—nor fear Lest in a new land drear I pass beyond the reach of love and flowers and bays. Where God is, children are, And sweet love, and the star Of labour and of hope,—and woman's tread; Woman whose tender breath Fills all the vales of death Like the far miles of countless rose-scent shed In the Caucasian vales: Such death no spirit pales, For where there lasts a rose, no death-pale soul is dead. Where love is, death is not; Yea, not o'er any spot Where sweet love treads hath bitter death the power: Not over England's seas, Nor the immortal breeze, Nor one white pure imperishable flower Of English womanhood, Nor one true bard who stood True to his love and land through life's fast-flitting hour. 1880. NINETEENTH CENTURY SONNETS I retain these Sonnets, written in 1881, as accurately expressing the sadness felt at that time by thoughtful minds, overshadowed by the gloomy suggestions of Positivism and materialistic science. To-day, I need hardly say, the universe, far from seeming Godless and material, appears to me to be simply saturated with God and spiritual potency. G. B. August, 1902. I. Love is worth having: this we know and preach. Though heartless, mindless, soulless, Nature be, And all the voices of her wild white sea Have nought of loving helpful God to teach; Though, piercing far beyond the stars, we reach More stars,—but no high heaven of sacred glee; Though summer laughing in the dense green tree Hath but a mocking restless helpless speech; Though this be so, yet love is passing fair And more than ever do we seek her face, And seek her breast, and nestle in her hair, And dream of her delight in every place. What have we left to do, now God is gone, Save just to love and weep and labour on? II. And yet the sadness! All the flowers are dead. The blue skies bend above us,—but no more They fill with strange glad light the laughing shore, Nor buoyant swings the lily's orange head, Nor smiles the moss-rose, large and sweet and red: Hushed are the joyous sounds we heard of yore; The planet's sweet spring-days of love are o'er; The planet's summer-jocund days have fled. We know, and knowing, cease to love and feel:— O great God, art thou dead,—canst thou not be? May we no more adore thy face and kneel? Grim is our triumph, and forlorn are we. Mournful the silvery moonrays round us steal, And very mournful shines the Godless sea. III. Have we been loving, when we fondly dreamed God loved,—and watched and guarded us and held? Is the swift world by soulless wings impelled And hath the sun for ever heartless gleamed? Are the blue depths just blue and nothing more That once with countless habitations teemed And steps o'er which great armies used to pour And walls that with the eternal glory beamed? O simple sweet world hanging in the void Of tremulous ether, terribly alone Thou art,—by thine own innate forces buoyed And through the air's dense populous eddies thrown With pale Chance at the helm. O world forlorn, Better it had been hadst thou ne'er been born! IV. And is the Christ who rose with heaven-bright wings Dead, dead for ever? Did he never rise And cleave with helm and plume the shadowy skies? What is this message that our sad age brings? Oh, weird the low disastrous whisper rings And fast around the darkening planet flies: “Man stands alone; all former creeds were lies; Truth open every heavenly doorway flings!” The doors are open, and we gaze in dread Thinking perchance some living God to see,— Great eyes that burn from some divine vast head, Or golden sceptre flaming terribly: But our own shadow we behold instead, And but for that the rooms would empty be! V. Something is left: to love and wrestle on Beneath the soulless glaring loveless sky; To toil and bleed and suffer, till we die When the swift circle of our years hath gone. Sweet selfless love at least is not a lie; Love hath its own eternal Godhead still, And we may live as Gods through might of will And mix our souls with all thoughts pure and high. Strength is in Man, if Man created God And through his own thought wove the awful Name And reared God's great grand palace on earth's sod And ringed it round with hell's red guardian flame:— Strength is in Man,—and he with fire is shod And he the earth's wide fruitful fields may claim. PRIESTS AND POETS SONNET Why are the priests and poets never at one? Because the poet's heart is like the sea Boundless and fearless, and his song should be Equal with stars and with the changeless sun. Because a priest speaks, and his work is done, But poets' words sound on eternally. Because the poet's soul is wide and free, But priests' souls cease, like stagnant streams, to run. Because their Christ bled nobly once, but now Their souls are too insensitive to bleed And gold, not thorns, circles their turgid brow; For this it is that singers and the seed Of singers hate and spurn and disallow Their sealess flowerless sunless starless creed. July 2, 1881. “IN A STRANGE DREAM” SONNET In a strange dream I passed beyond the host I led, and stood upon the field alone.— Round me were corpses pale and overthrown; No living friend,—but many a blood-stained ghost. Beaconed in front the fires from post to post: I heard the ringing passionate trumpets blown; Ten thousand eyes were focussed in my own; Like endless waves upon an endless coast The enemy's army stretched in front of me. I caught the ravening eyes of all of these Within my own like spears upon a shield And held them till that army seemed to yield Vanquished, as at the cliff's glance sink the seas.— Then I looked round for God. And where was he? 1883. A DEATH-SONG Bury me not In some lone spot, Though tender flowers be there of love's own training; Yea, not the meadow-sweet And ferns about my feet Would keep my lonesome spirit from complaining; My soul would fly afar Where human spirits are, In sight of human forms some solace gaining. Take me to where In weighted air Of mine own well-beloved eternal city Great fervid thoughts arise, Yea, where men's glowing eyes Gleam ever with fresh hope or love or pity; Oh set me but within London's impassioned din, And even my dead pale lips may chant a ditty. Plant fragrant bloom Above my tomb, Yea, all the season's gentlest maiden flowers; Ferns, and the creamy grace Of lilies thereon place, And build above me rose-hung shaded bowers; But take my body not To any country plot, There to be tortured by the brainless showers. Let flowers of thought To me be brought, Yea, all the pent-up city's burning treasures; When lovers young begin Their new sweet life to win, Let me in spirit smile amid their pleasures; Let the strange sunset red That crowns dim London's head Be the first air of heaven my wing-sweep measures. No rest I crave, No quiet grave, But ceaseless passionate life,—yea, this for ever; A living spirit high I would not stoop to die Or cease the old songful turbulent endeavour; I would for ever know Sweet love, though that be woe, And passion, though its pain abateth never. Give me, O Death, Not slumbering breath As of a child, but all a man's completeness; Grant me the perfect strength And risen power at length Of man, and pour upon me woman's sweetness From lips of women dear Whom thy hand may bring near, Staying for me their heavenly swift-foot fleetness. I fear thee not If but my lot Bring me love's sacred gifts and spotless favour: Yea, if love's utmost glow My living soul may know And love's fruit's innermost most precious savour, Methinks I have a force Thee, pale Death, to unhorse, And never at thy thundering tilt need waver. O woman sweet Whose gentle feet Have brought me in this world mine holiest blessing, Be near me, kiss me, when No help avails of men, But only thine help, godlike and caressing; Lift me above the tomb, Yea, sever thou the gloom, And deaden thou death's fleshly pangs distressing. Rise with me, love, This life above, Long ere the actual death the doorway shadeth; That when his real step sounds And his cold breath abounds, And his deep sword our fast-joined heart invadeth, Victors already we May, in our calm strength, be— And conquerors then, as each the other aideth. Then in no tomb, No death-crowned gloom, We—you and I, sweet love—will rest or tarry; No blossoms shall we need, Nor priests to intercede, Nor prayers our air-light souls towards heaven to carry: For death died long ago When, white as just-fallen snow, God stooped, august from heaven, our souls to marry. TO THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY Lo! through the dismal tides of tribulation We struggle long. Chained are thy chosen souls in every nation: Fettered, though strong. Lift thou thy face, and all the dark is broken As with great light. Through all the blackness speak one word of token, One word of might. We trust thee with a trust that cannot alter Though skies be grim. Our foemen gather around: we do not falter Though hope grows dim. We know in the end that thy great hand shall find us; That we shall sleep Within thy bosom as in the home assigned us, Reward to reap. By all the scent of gracious summer filling Thy neck and hands; By thy sweet touch our souls and bodies thrilling And saving lands, Deliver us, and with the ancient splendour Imbue the skies, Till the old hymns of happy hearts and tender To thy throne rise. We are forlorn and weary and forsaken, So men declare: Yet are we firm and changeless and unshaken, For yet thou art fair Before us in the great eternal meadows Where spring shines bright, And in the purple fathomless far shadows Of boundless night. We trust thee and we flinch not, O our deathless God, love and queen! We follow thee with all the old rapture breathless And thy robes' sheen. Not pain can turn, nor death destroy who follow The bloom of thee, From morning's flame till evening's shadows swallow Thy shore and sea. May 21, 1881. A HYMN I Great God of the wide seas, king too of the space Severing star from gold star, with thy dwelling-place Far amid the cloud-lands, fold in thine embrace Hearts whose intense emotion Like world-wide tides of ocean Yearneth for thy blessing, panteth for thy grace. II Pure as are the roses, white as is the foam, Great God of the mountains, through the starry dome Passing like the night-wind, lift us, waft us, home; For we cry with daring, Suffering souls upbearing,— Souls that through life's desert, stricken, struggling, roam. III Art thou in the heavens? dost thou, high God, care Nothing for the torment which with winged swift spear Blood-dyed at the sharp point, doth assail us here? Are we alone for ever? Wilt thou redeem us never? Nor sweep the thunderous dark-hued threatening fierce skies clear? IV Grant us thy redemption: make us one with thee In thy rapture-dawn in morning o'er the sea, In thy passion-calm in sunset's purity; Let the strange white cloud-billows For our souls too as pillows Gleam forth; let man victorious o'er outspread nature be. V God, thou art immortal; burn us with thy flame, With the soul-deep longing that for utter shame Purifies each effort, cleanses every aim,— That we may find the death-land But one divine rose-breath land, Treading it triumphant, trusting in thy Name. VI Oh, thy flowers are endless; why should human feet Vanish, when thou fillest woods with meadow-sweet Every fresh year gently, for the woods to greet? Canst thou not save the nations Who bring thee heart-oblations As thou yearly savest, God, the golden wheat? VII Raise us from our sins, God,—lift us from the tomb; Make each woman's soul pure as a rose in bloom; In each strong man's spirit every sin consume; With sacred selfless love fulfil us; With thy sweet spirit's yearning thrill us; A sun of hope, divide thou all the wavering gloom. VIII Strengthen us to march on, stedfast day by day, Brace us, purge us, guide us, guard us, God we pray; Through the burning noontide, through the twilight grey, Be with us, great God, to deliver; Fill thou with shafts our spirit's quiver; Be our brazen buckler in the blind affray. IX Be to us in love-land timely shield and shade; As a giant oak-tree watching o'er a glade: Let thy perfect calm bright passion-land pervade; Bend thou above the perfect sleep Of lovers with thy wings that weep Dewdrops divine above them, ready e'er to aid. X Thou art the spirit of love, God: thou thy love instil; With thy power of passion all our soul's veins fill; We would love in one line with thy loving will; Let all things else save love be dead, But love lift high her timeless head,— Love with the force to fashion, make alive or kill. XI Let our souls be music: thou art music, Lord— Music's stainless awful rapture-wingéd sword; Thy great heart respondeth, answereth, chord by chord, The music of the ages That now desponds, now rages, Triumphs again, tremendous, through vast channels poured. XII God, through pain, through anguish, make us one with thee: One with hill and sky-line: one with surging sea: One with thine own splendid death-surmounting free Great soul that fills all things With music of sweet wings Floating above the tides of years that flee. 1880. AN ADJURATION By the old white maze of swift bewildering billows That stormed the strand; By the old dear woods' autumnal mossy pillows, By thy white hand; By far streams washing tips of bended willows, A far-off land! By all sweet sacred memories I adjure thee, By cliff, by star, By maze of garden shrubs that now secure thee Where no songs are; By the old soft dreams that once, sweet, did allure thee, By pain's red scar! By all the tossing tides of bitter sorrow, A foaming main; By love's low whispers when he sought to borrow New hope in vain; By nightly prayers for nobler dawns to-morrow, New heights to gain! By moons that swam serenely o'er the ocean, Gilding the foam; By our young hearts' sustained intense emotion, By passion's home; By the long deep Lethean nightshade potion Given while we roam. By mine own heart that never can forget thee; By flowers of song; By my swift lyre that ceaseless doth regret thee Forlorn so long; By every tender flower that since hath met thee, By yearning strong. By silvery moonlight flooding garden reaches Long leagues inland, Reminding thee of rays that lit the old beaches, The wave-swept strand; By this sad song itself whose mouth beseeches Touch of thine hand; Be gracious:—as the summer rose is tender, Be thou to me! Unveil, white love, thy white eternal splendour As by the sea Love saw soft lips and shaking hands surrender: So let it be. Lo! how the moonlight o'er the mountains hoary Of time yet beams: Rise thou, O woman moon, haloed with glory, With gentle gleams; Close thou the wandering wail of passion's story, Of passion's dreams. Before the October winds the grasses harden Tarry for me In quiet nook of red-leaved autumn garden, Or by the sea: Thyself give for sweet token of sweet pardon, The bloom of thee. By burning light of sunrise on the spaces Of old fair seas; By the swift laughing light of love that chases The quick-winged breeze; By our words' wings and the immemorial races, O love, of these; Rise thou, a woman at last, and, flower-delightful, In close embrace Pour through mine eyes the unforgotten rightful Dream of thy face; Let love be ardent, masterful and mightful, Some little space. Rose of all roses, wait within the garden, Wait thou alone, Woman's soft thrill of over-tender pardon Within thy tone; Wait ere the stealthy frosts the first blades harden, Ere chill winds moan! 1880. MAN'S OVERTHROW Straight through the strongest heart God's arrow goes At God's unerring will. The strongest spirit knows Deepliest how God can make alive or kill. Man stands erect and challenges the Lord With fiery soul to fight. But lo! God's sudden sword Pierces his spirit in the midmost night. In the deep dreary moonless midnight gloom Beside the couch One stands: Not empty is the room: The darkness parts at touch of unseen hands: And God says, “Thou wast strong and full of fire And valiant as the sea; I know thine heart's desire; If I reject thy longing, what of thee?” Then, face to face with the eternal Thought, With not one star to aid, Man feels himself as nought: The fieriest spirit is the most afraid. The strongest spirit is exposed the most To the stern swordlike Thought, And soonest of the host Of rebels to supreme repentance brought. For on his strength God's strength with fiery shock Impinges, and he cries, “I am smitten as by a rock Hurled from the watchful hollows of the skies!” The strength of God seeks out the strongest soul To combat,—and it breaks The strongest, and makes whole Soonest the heart whose very roots it shakes. THE PERSONAL GOD Through youth the poet dreams of God arrayed In the gold sunset-light Or the dark robes of night: God dwells in flowers and stars and leafy shade. God dwells amid the rocks Or 'mid the thunders of the seas is heard Or in the spring-taught songs of many a bird Or bleating of the flocks. But then there comes a time when God no more Is visible in these Dark waters and dim trees Nor mixes with the music of the shore. Before the singer towers, Person to person, solemn face to face, The very God who led the Jewish race And who is leading ours. TO THE UNKNOWN FATHER OF JESUS A word for thee, thou poor forgotten Jew, Who loving Mary dreamedst not that she (Thy kiss worked wonders vaster than she knew!) Would bear the King of all posterity. Thou left'st within the world its fairest light, Obscure begetter of the Nazarene, Whose passionate love-act in an Eastern night Produced the grandest soul the world has seen. Hail, unknown father, undiscerned bridegroom, Who, having passed to regions dim and far, Lost in the ages, buried in time's gloom, Yet left'st within man's world its loveliest star! A thousand shrines for her, the undefiled, By blue Italian lake, Italian sea; Wild worship for the mother of the child— But from men's lying tongues what word for thee? What word for thee, without whom none the less The world had suffered an unmeasured loss? The Saviour was the fruit of thy caress: Without thy love had been nor crown, nor cross,— No cross, no crown, no Jesus. Not one church Had reared its sacred sign in any land! And yet no thinker ever thought to search For thee,—no dreamer cared to understand. Thou wast not good, it may be—high nor great: And yet to thee our greatest owed his breath. Thou wast the watcher at his birth's bright gate, As Pilate watched beside his gate of death. Thee thy son's church has chosen to ignore. The world, with its false sighs and foolish tears, Crying, “Mary virgin! Mary we adore!” Has passed thee by for eighteen hundred years. And what of fatherhood it cared to ascribe To Jesus' father, this to God it gave; Dismissed the thought of thee with jeer and gibe —Thou wast a dead man deep within the grave! Thou hast been wronged.—The mighty God of flowers, Of storms, of sunsets, of the human race; He whose hand sways all destinies of ours; He with the unseen ever-present face: He, herder of the clouds, whose right hand drives The sun's gold chariot through the gleaming sky; Lord of our birth and master of our lives; He at whose word red battle's millions die: He at whose word the chargers of the waves Leap snowy-maned upon the trembling shore; Who in the blue gulf digs the great ships' graves; He whom the stars in all their shrines adore: Could he not leave to Mary and to thee Thy child and hers? Why must the Lord divorce Father from mother? Why must purity, Truth, love, all suffer through man's fancies coarse? The truth is grandest. Years may pass away: Yet by one night's wild love-kiss thou hast won, Poor Jew, the right through every age to say, “I loved the mother. Jesus is my son.” MAY: AN EPISODE I. SEPTEMBER TO MAY A song of storm-blown dark-browed sad September, A song of autumn to the light of May; A song for spring's soft girl-heart to remember When autumn's tired heart passes quite away. How many loves have stood with looks of gladness Within the portals memory's stars illume! But in the end the laughter changed to sadness And passion's heart grew ice-cold at a tomb. Now, give me not the passion-flower that perishes, But love that hath within it friendship's light: The starlike love Time's conquering strong hand cherishes When passion's sun sinks, foundering in the night. Be May, divinely bright, divinely tender, With eyes wherethrough my last romance may gleam. O flower-sweet heart, bring back the lost years' splendour, As May restores each year the dead springs' dream. 'Tis well to know that when the whole hereafter Seems dark, when wrinkled pain courts sorrow's eyes, Pain's brow grows smooth before a young girl's laughter And sorrow owns her sovereignty, and flies. Our England needs her hills and singing waters, Her ever-virgin zone of sunlit sea; But most of all she needs her fair-souled daughters: The mist-veiled future hath its task for thee. Bear ever in mind, of all her pure girl-roses Each stainless rose makes England's armour strong; Renews her force as each wild century closes, Till war's fierce clarion cheers her like a song. And bear in mind that dim September, seeking Nought now but rest within the darkening grove, Found still within his heart the strength for speaking One strange sweet word, and that one word was love. II. A SONG OF MAY Like a beam of the sun she glittered On a world grown dark and old: She touched grief's brow and crowned it, And the sorrowless crown was of gold. The green woods laughed for gladness; The sea tossed rainbow spray; And the hills shook off their sadness, And the wild rose whispered, “May.” At the glory in girls' young faces A man's heart throbs and it stirs: But I know where the sovereign grace is; Their beauty is not like hers! June gladdens, or April pains us: But their spell is an hour's, or a day's. They have no strange charm that chains us; Their magic is not like May's. And now, if the sunlight leaves me, If a parting comes with its pang, If I meet the white ghost Silence In the room where the young laugh rang, I shall murmur, in darkness dreaming Of a girl's bright looks and ways, “There was never a glance so peerless! There was never a smile like May's!” III. A CHRISTMAS EVE Over London, wintry London, fell the darkness and the gloom: In my heart was leaden silence, even the silence of the tomb. Like a monster on the city rushed the grim night, sablemailed; Lamps that tossed their spears against it, seemed but sparks that flashed and failed. Was it Christmas, “merry” Christmas? Were there sounds of mirth and song? Or would only ghostly faces round about my footpath throng? Is it Christmas to earth's mourners? Are the holly-berries red When the hands that used to love them are the cold hands of the dead? Not an island far in ocean, by the foot of man untrod, Where the flowers send virgin sweetness through the still air up to God, Not a death-doomed star and voiceless, void of song of bird or leaf, Is so lonely as our London, when the heart is wrung with grief. But the gloom was changed to sunlight when a woman's swift step came, And the gold sun smote the darkness with his shafts of sudden flame. How the light of some one's beauty and the brightness in her eyes Brought again lost light of summers, brought again June's fervent skies! For the gift of your sweet presence through one golden afternoon, May, my heart's own love, I thank you—for the blessing, for the boon Of two hours of happy laughter, for the sense of long pain done, For the scent of flowers in winter, and the comfort of the sun. IV. AT A GRAVE A young world's laughter rang at summer's word: My heart within me grew most strangely stirred While life that left the dead form flowed through one Full of the rose and splendid with the sun. Beauty that once had flowered in perfect bloom Within that darkling cavern slept in gloom; The eyes that held all hearts with starlike flame Knew not what stars had set, nor what stars came; The lips that, speaking, chained, the hands that drew, One with the unpitying earth in silence grew; Immortal beauty, mortal found alas! Mixed with the mould and blended with the grass; The charm we thought would mock the conquering years Now wins no tribute save the gift of tears. But by the grave above the ill-omened earth Stands sovereign morning, not with morning's mirth But, ten times sweeter, ten times more divine, With downcast eyes wherein the soft tears shine. With more than summer in most perfect smile Beside a girl's grave pauses for awhile A girl; around her all the glad world gleams; Her pitying eyes grow tender while she dreams Of dreams that shone through eyes that never more Will watch green hills, blue waters, golden shore. She brings the dark world news: she tells the graves Of sunlit laughter on a thousand waves Death clouds not ever,—she brings the dead girl dreams Of moonlit whispers in a thousand streams, Of radiant summer tinging every leaf With hues that know not death, that dread not grief, Secrets by her pure soul from Nature won, Love from the stars, a greeting from the sun. Still doth the eternal life by its own laws Proceed, with never check, no lasting pause. Where beauty vanished deep within the gloom, Lo! beauty stands. Where ruled the iron-browed tomb, Where Winter reigned, behold Spring's sun-kissed skies And deathless light in unimagined eyes. Deep thanks I render. I, brow-wreathed with night, Past language weary, rest within thy light. Dark-eyed sweet sorceress, friend whose help bestowed Turned wandering footsteps towards a happier road, My love, mine Iseult, for thy birth-star gleamed On those same waters where dead Iseult dreamed, For thee I tarry; as the thunder's car Changes its course and pauses at a star. V. LOVE, THE TEACHER Not by standing at their graves and weeping Win we audience of the ghostly throng: Those we left beneath the green grass sleeping Need not tears it may be, only song. Not by ceaseless groans and bitter anguish Shall we reach their hearts and bring them nigh: Not by wringing idle hands that languish; Not by watching starless wastes of sky. Where the strong sun gilds the morning mountains, Where the ceaseless crystal waters leap Laughing from the depths of rainbow fountains, There are those we left alone, asleep. Death may claim, and for one moment blinds them— As he blinds us with his sudden hand. Then the unconquered glance of morning finds them, As it finds the slumbering sea and land. Morning finds, and with sweet violence wakes them, Pointing towards the red lips of the day. Towards the embraces of the noon it takes them, Bidding suffering's wan signs pass away. Clearly 'tis so. How did I discern it? Deem no sunset burns with wasted gold? By one road the singer's heart may learn it; From the lips of woman, as of old. By sweet love within his soul renewing All the strength that vanished when a tomb Closed against his maddened step pursuing Sunless doors of iron, gates of gloom. By the knowledge, daily stronger growing, That the love of woman hath no end: By hope's fountain from the dark rock flowing Through the love and sweet help of a friend. VI. “SUMMER IN HIS SONG” Not for thee the rose with sudden bloom Springs from out the grass around a tomb, Not for thee. All the world for thee is glad and bright: Still the stars adore the purple night; Still the purple night adores the sea. Still the birds' blue eggs within the nest, Girdled by the heart of spring-time, rest Safe and warm. Still the sun is full of golden rays; Still the ceaseless light of summer days Cows the storm. Not for thee the ever-darkening years Weave their wayward crowns with pearls of tears, Crowns of grief. When the autumn's fiery glory gleams, 'Tis to thee a season full of dreams Fluttering round in every crimson leaf. Spring that clothes the glowing meads in gold Takes thy girlish hand in hers to hold, Holds it tight:— Quitting April, hand in hand with May, Spring will smile and whisper through the day, Through the night. Every year's each season brings its charm: June hath starry bracelets for thine arm, For thine hair Snowy circlets of the vestal rose. Summer nights that bring to thee repose Bring to singers sleepless-eyed despair. Not for thee the bitter wreaths of thorns, But the golden flowers of golden morns Glad and long. Though the singer's locks are touched with grey Spring-time in his heart he gives to May, Summer in his song. VII. “ONE HOUR OF MAY'S” After Metaphysic's dreary song Back to thee I turn, Finding much of love's pure lore I long Yet to learn. After all the feasts of learning spread Grand before my gaze, Love's sweet mandate thrills my heart instead At a glance of May's. After all the lengthy windy words Spun from mankind's tongue, Strange relief to hear a girl's, or bird's, Said or sung. After wandering through the weary days, Sad, alone, Glad delight to feel one hour of May's Is my own. VIII. “IF I GO FIRST” If I go first, convey to all the flowers Thanks for the fragrance of a thousand hours: My thanks return to all the bowers of June; To friendly stars, to ever-faithful moon. When sweet in spring the lilac-clusters smell Remember there was one who loved them well: But take no thanks, no greeting to the sea, For that is even a part, the soul, of me; May ever the soul within my slumbering form Thrill to the blast, and madden at the storm! When thou dost note the purple pansy, bright Just in the centre with one gold star's light, Or when thou gatherest from the wildwood sprays Pink shell-like roses in the glad June days, Remember one who loved—or loves, who knows?— Night in the pansy, sundawn in the rose. This sculptured bust of one in days that were Not deeplier loved than thou art, nor more fair, This, if thou wilt, in soft remembrance take, And, with her picture, cherish for my sake. As thou hast watched full oft beside her tomb, Watch beside mine; and pierce the lampless gloom With stars more potent than the stars on high, The starry love that sways eternity. IX. “CHRISTMAS EVE AND NEW YEAR'S DAY” Christmas Eve and New Year's Day Both in one Bade the shadows flee away, Brought me sun: Brought me many thoughts and dreams Glad and bright; Silver voice of summer streams Through the night; Scent of many a rose in bloom Through the day: Changed to glorious light the gloom And the grey: Woke again within my heart Clear and strong What had threatened to depart, Passion's song: Lit once more the starlike thought In my brain, Which exulted to be brought Once again; Thought I had not known for years, Pure and sweet; Thought that brings the sudden tears To repeat; Thought that after all the days And their whirl Of despair and blank amaze, Just a girl With the emerald in her eyes Mixed with gleam Of the agate as it lies In the stream, With the darkness in her hair Of the night, On her lips the morning's fair Rosy light, Hope with tender hands might save From the tomb, Open heaven beyond the grave And its gloom: Just the thought it would be sweet, Passing fair, To lie wounded at her feet, Dying there, So the death might bring her bliss, Bliss divine, And by love's eternal kiss Make her mine. X. ARMED FOR THE BATTLE Give my hand a sword to hold, Bring a helmet wrought of gold, A cuirass Where the sun may see his rays Flame and pass, As he treads the cloudy ways. Place a weapon in my hand That will welcome and withstand Many blows, In my helmet fix a white Snowy rose, For I battle for the right. On my breastplate let a star That will glitter from afar Flash and gleam; For the night with all its wrong Like a dream Shall be scattered at my song. Every girl in London needs One who proves him by his deeds Beauty's thrall; One whose ready weapon leaps At a call From the scabbard where it sleeps: One who wins him in the fray, The wild struggle of each day, Force and fame; Adding somewhat hour by hour To his name, Till it breaks to golden flower. Then this blossom bright and blown Shall be hers and hers alone, Shall expand If she wills it at her breast, When the hand That bestowed it is at rest. XI. MY SEA-BIRD Here in London where the days March forlorn through misty ways, Damp and dun,— Looking long for golden rays, Finding none; In our city, where the year Follows spring-time on its bier, Decked in showers,— Where our summers bring severe Sunless flowers; Sweet it is to gaze at thee, Dark-haired daughter of the sea, Of the West, Supple, pliant as a tree Wind-carest. From old Cornwall's windy shore Comest thou, whom I adore In thy grace, Seeing Tristram's wave-kissed oar, Iseult's face. All the sense of sea and sun Thou hast brought us, thou hast won, May divine, With the eyes that never shun Love in mine. Like a sea-bird fain to rest Thou art wind-swept from the West To our home, Sea-willed ever, and with breast White as foam. XII. REST AT LAST After years upon the sea Passing sweet it is to me Here to rest As in island full of bloom, Hearing far away the boom Of the billows as they break, Eager, each, its wrath to slake On the coral-reef's lone crest. After years of strife and pain Passing sweet it is to gain For a space, May, my darling, rest with thee Far from thunders of the sea, And to watch within thine eyes Mingled colours of the skies, Light and shadow on thy face. If I had not fought so hard, Were my helmet not so scarred, Dinted deep, Then it would not be the same; But my life until you came Was a life of swords and blows— Now I find in thee repose: Very sweet are rest and sleep. Sweet it must be unto one After labours 'neath the sun, Labours long, Now at last to see thee stand With a garland in thine hand, And to feel that peace at last When the foam-white reefs are past Waits for singer and for song. XIII. THE HIGHER LOVE If I may not see thee much, Sweet at least it is to touch Hand and hand; Sweet at least it is to know That a heart can understand And that sympathy can grow. If I may not win thee now, I can worship thy pure brow Where the hair Coils so lovingly for crown— Can rejoice to find thee fair, And may win for thee renown. That is much to do indeed: If the world shall give its heed As it goes With swift footstep on its way, Saying, “Here there blooms a rose Worth an instant of delay;” Saying, “Here was passion strong Nobly shrined within a song, Purely framed:” Then, my darling, when I pass, I shall not be all ashamed, Leaving you above the grass; Leaving you above the mould, Watching silver stars and gold Evermore, For your eyes are in my song, And the wings of verse can soar And the prayer of love is strong. If I may not hold you quite To my heart, I may delight To be near; I may clasp you in my thought; At a distance I may hear, By a sigh I may be brought. That is love—the love supreme That outlasts wild passion's dream; That can stand When the very stars must fall, For it travels hand in hand With the mighty Lord of all. That is love—the love that gives, And rejoices while it lives Still to bring Gifts eternal to the shrine: Flowers of summer, flowers of spring, Gifts unselfish, gifts divine. That is love, at which men say, “Though the sunlit month of May Passes soon Yet his May, the song-god saith, Shall be subject not to June Nor to winter, nor to death.” XIV. “JUST A YEAR” Just a year 'tis since we met, Just a year! Many suns have risen and set; Many stars have waxed and waned, Flowers have fled, but love remained; Love's bright presence has been here Just a year. Will he linger, will he pass, He who stays Never 'mid the meads of grass, Never on the mountain-steeps; For his swift foot never sleeps, And his progress he delays Not for Mays. Not for May, and not for June Will he wait, Not for August's cheery tune; Not for hungry-hearted prayer Flung against the hollow air, Hurled against his golden gate: Love is Fate. Will he tarry, love, for thee? Will he pause, Looking down on thee and me? Will he grant another year, Moved by song or prayer or tear To relax his iron laws By a clause? When another year has gone Shall we say, “Time may threaten, love lives on”? When a million roses red Change to white and join the dead, Fallen, and trodden into clay, Flung away! When another year has flown With its light, Then will one love on alone? Will a lonely lover say, “Wings I fashioned for her: May With those very wings took flight Through the night”? XV. “PASSION BLOSSOMS, THEN DIES” Passion blossoms, then dies And its bloom Passes quite, and its eyes Sunlit once like the skies Close in gloom. Give me love that will last When the fire Of romance in the past Sunsetlike fadeth fast On its pyre. Give me love more divine Than the light Of a star that can shine For a month, then decline In a night. If you love me, why so Let it be: But with love that will grow From a stream's quiet flow To a sea. XVI. LOVE IN LONDON In London far from grass or tree Our love took form; Far-off from wild song of the sea In storm. Not where the forest's silent bride, The white moon, dreams, Nor where the iris glows beside The streams: Not by green bank or scented mound, By burn or mere, My sad eyes caught thy glance and found Thee dear. In London, city of ceaseless gloom, Grim sunless place, I found one girlish flower in bloom,— Thy face. In London, where no stars are seen, For all light dies, I found two stars of deathless sheen,— Thine eyes. For London, though it gives no flowers And gives no light, Gives priceless crowns of passionate hours Most bright. In winter, when our fire was red, The curtains drawn, Who longed to see the gold-helmed head Of dawn? Who cared what shafts of sunset flew Through blood-stained air? Not I—for you were sunshine, you Were there! When leaped the amber stream of tea From silver spout, Was not with joy the surly sea Shut out? Or when our lamp with rose-red shade At dusk was lit, Who missed the moon, that thankless jade, One bit? Ah! London after all's the friend To court and claim. It gives us love, and in the end Gives fame. XVII. “LOVE ALONE” The poet, victor over words, Coy wayward things, Deems he can snare the stars, those gold-plumed birds, Because he sings! He dreams of endless conquest, he— While others plod He must win thunder-music from the sea, Epics from God. The fragrance of the lips of June In sunlit dales His song must steal. The slender white-breast moon His hand unveils. Because one hour of mortal breath He makes sublime, His fond heart dreams of victory over death And space, and time. And woman most of all he dreams His song can hold; As Orpheus lured the nymphs from silent streams With harp of gold. Her, chainless, full of force and charm Whom gods have sought In vain, the singer dreams he can disarm By one winged thought. Whom centuries fail to understand He, strong to dare, Dreams he can win, and lay a conqueror's hand On sun-crowned hair. In vain, in vain, O singer proud! No songs disthrone. The free heart yields, the sovereign head is bowed To love alone. XVIII. A MESSENGER Two years within the lonely room I watched. No sweet ghost came: No hand that sought mine, grasping through the gloom; No wings more sun-bright than the dawn's bright flame. All waited, silent, as of old; The pictures and the chair: The merry firelight touched to dancing gold The mantle, framed, of her who was not there. Then lo! one winter night it happed That I sat there alone, Lonely in heart as moonless hills snow-capped, Dreaming of love's pale desecrated throne; When through the door there passed a form With beauty crowned and light Whose wings imperious took the dark by storm, As sunrise storms the rampires of the night. The night's pure freshness wreathed her head: The live soul of the sun Shone through her eyes She gazed at me and said, “Behold! the living and the dead are one.” With living voice that strangely sweet Upon my spirit fell She said: “I come to comfort and to greet; I come to tell thy spirit that all is well.” XIX. THE TEMPTER When Satan found that woman's heart Was strong and brave, To tempting woman all his art And subtlest thought he gave. And since he knew that flowers are nought, Frail gifts, wind-blown, His hand with peerless cunning wrought Bright deathless flowers of stone. All forms, all colours, he combined And sought strange ways To lure and charm the loitering mind And snare the greedy gaze. One woman's soul was stainless still: The ruby came With rays that weakened spirit and will And conquering blood-red flame. Another's heart was heart of steel, Till sapphires drew That heart to theirs with fond appeal Of eyes of heavenly blue. Another's heart was cold and hard: The emerald gleamed; Of lovers' steps on moonlit sward That heart with passion dreamed. Another heart resisted long:— What heart, a girl's, For ever can resist the song The sea chants through its pearls? So one by one the dark king took The women all. Lest any should refuse to look, Predestined not to fall, He set within the turquoise, bright, The blue sky's noon, And in the opal sunset-light And rays of stars and moon. But some hearts yet remained unbought, Unbribed, unwon: Keen Satan softly smiled, and brought Diamonds, that held the sun. E'en so he failed to move each will, To bend all knees; For woman's true soul values still Love's diamond more than these. XX. “FORGIVE, FORGET” If I have pained thee by a word, If, May, when last we met, A doubt shot through me, wild, absurd, Forgive, forget. Love is so scarce, truth is so rare, So swift-winged is regret, So keen the spear-points of despair— Forgive, forget. Believe me, if the quick tears sprang, If thy soft eyes were wet Almost, I also felt a pang: Forgive, forget. Be gracious, love, and for love's sake Bear with me even yet. The best of me discern and take; The rest forget! XXI. “THE HEART OF MAY” The green Spring comes with gladness; Its golden meadows gleam; But sometimes full of sadness Those golden meadows seem. So long ago they glittered With that same fairy gold: But now our hearts are weary; The West Wind's touch seems cold. We and our hearts have travelled Through many a grove and glade; Have marked the shadows lengthen, Have watched the sunlight fade. The voices now that summon Sound weirdly from afar: The sun we seek and worship Is evening's first white star. But still the lilac blossoms With soul that mocks at gloom, And tosses snowier plumelets Above each silent tomb: If we are old and weary, Our best songs long since sung, The soul of Spring is deathless, The heart of May is young! XXII. SPRING Just as a maiden newly wed, Whose lips half long, whose heart half fears, Meets love with smiles, while soft eyes shed Triumphant tears, The moon, that through the winter slept In dreary caves of iron night, Arose and smiled, arose and wept, Arose, most bright. The sun, with ardent amorous thirst And lips that scoffed at cold delay, Went madly craving for the first Warm kiss of May. The stars, that missed with grief and pain The scent of flowers, the sound of mirth, Smiled down from heaven and kissed again The flower-sweet earth. And Winter paled—aye, Winter fled And rubbed his chapped old hands, All cracked and roughened, seamed and red, And sought far lands. And I rejoiced. I heard, I felt, A voice, a hand, that bade the grey Grim winter from within me melt; The voice, the touch, of May. XXIII. ONE DAY IN SPRING From fields made bright with flowers in bloom A young girl turned And sought a darkling London room, Wherein one gas-jet burned. She left the blossoming meads behind, The silent nooks Where fragrant violets wooed the wind Or whispered to the brooks: She passed through streets where wild wheels roar And dust-wreaths race,— Brought sunshine to a sunless door, Light to a weary face: She left the golden furze to scent The soft air's wing; Made for one hour one heart content, And filled it with the spring. XXIV. A SPRING-SONG To thee the flower-bright season brings Glad thoughts of days and years unknown. Thou see'st not summer's restless wings; Thou see'st his light alone. The thought of summers lying dead With quiet hands most still and white Comes not, when summer's rose blooms red And summer's sun flames bright. Before thee Love, superb and fair, With summoning eyes that seek thee stands. No ghost-love, sister to despair, Wrings pale and piteous hands. The lilies all, arrayed in white Around thy path fresh fragrance pour. No lily from beyond thy sight Has passed, for evermore. For thee life's harp triumphant rings; The glad notes mingle not with tears: No strange sigh shivers through the strings, No wail from far-off years. No proud carnation, fiery red, No sun-crowned joy-delirious rose, To thee with sudden doubt has said, “What comes, when sunshine goes?” The wan tomb's gates gleam not each morn; No spectres haunt thy sinless sleep. Death trembles at a young girl's scorn; Sin turns aside to weep. Let many a summer smile and shine For thee when ours have passed away, And many a griefless thought be thine On many a first of May! XXV. “LOVE'S GREETING FROM THE SEA” To thee far-off on sunlit land, 'Mid fragrant meads, 'neath blossomy tree, I send this gift to heart and hand, This song, O love, to thee. Here, where the green waves curve and curl And where the wide-winged winds are free, I think of one far-off, a girl Whose eyes are as the sea. The sea's strange light within them shines, The light whose gleam may never be 'Mid forests green, 'mid oaks or pines, But only on the sea. Here, where the sun's gold arrows dart On waves to windward and to lee, I send thee, love, with faithful heart Love's greeting from the sea. XXVI. PURENESS' CROWN England shall fill the centuries' hands with flowers And through the mortal years immortal be If woman's truth defends her swordless bowers, As guards her shores the sea. Then England shall abide; she shall not fail. No iron monsters of the deep secure: She needs not cunning suits of woven mail, If only her heart be pure. Though round us loom the thunders of the night And Europe ring with trumpet-peals of war, If in one English home pure love gleams bright On England shines a star. Not surelier down the cloud-veiled valleys move The sun's gold chariot-wheels at close of day Than lands decline, wherein men cease to love And women cease to pray. No jewelled crown that mocks the stars is grand As that soft white-rose crown pure women wear. No other sheds such lustre on the land, That for its sake grows fair. Nought weighs with us the centuries' smile or frown If England's daughters, sovereign, fearless, free, Wear on their brows for ever pureness' crown, As sunlight crowns her sea. XXVII. MAY-DAY “Give me the dark sky's windy gates,” I said: “The doors at which the sunset waits With threatening robes of lurid red. “I love the beating of the storm's Black wing; With its own hues pale grief informs The world, and poisons with its sting. “When through the wet leaves pours the hail Malign, I love the cold darts that assail The timorous rose, the shivering vine. “The dark heart loves the gloom, and dreads The sun; It loves the wind that tears to shreds The blossom-petals, one by one.” But on my heart, that struggled hard And long The sunlit moment to retard, There fell the sound of song:— “The leaves are green, the sky is blue, The air That lifts the gloom from earth, from you Lifts somewhat of despair. “Canst thou be sad, when blossoms weave Their crowns From fragrant morn till fragrant eve, Aye, even in heart of towns? “Canst thou be dark of soul, when bright And gay Upon thee gleams with loving light The sunniest smile of May?” XXVIII. “TWO RUBIES” The lilacs scented all the perfect air; Bright living emeralds flashed on every spray: Spring, ever fair to see, grew yet more fair Within the eyes of May. And I—I let my frost-bound heart expand; I let the soft air lull me to repose. I felt a joy the sun could understand, The sun that courts the rose. For, when the sun has striven through clouds and gloom For many a weary league, for many an hour, How must its strange soul worship all the bloom Of one cloud-conquering flower. There came a word those sunlit hours to mar. Two rubies glittering on a golden ring Said: “Soon will vanish some one dearer far Than all the flowers of spring!” A DAY AND A NIGHT IN ROME All day I gazed at pictures—passionate eyes Flashed from the canvas. Prisoned in pure stone I heard Diana's laugh and Daphne's sighs: Venus enthralled me from her timeless throne. I worshipped those whose ever-living Art Could make the marble breathe, the canvas glow; The spirit who spake through Raphael's hand and heart, The God who wrought through Michael Angelo. Lost in my dream of ages past and dead I heeded not the chariot of the sun,— Till all the western sky gleamed weird and red, And that long day of strange delight was done. Then, wandering homeward, lo! a laughing girl With lips not marble, and with heart not stone:— Round her brow coiled full many a blue-black curl; I won a joy to statue-lips unknown. I found that still in that fair wondrous land Beauty that baffled mortal speech was born: The sceptre fell from Theodora's hand; From Faustine's face I turned in silent scorn. Lucretia Borgia swayed no more my heart: Moreover now I knew that lustrous eyes Unknown to history, undiscerned by Art, Had mocked the moonlight in a thousand skies; That wild romances, while past starlight gleamed, Had thrilled the old streets and byeways of the land— That hearts had loved and died, or lived and dreamed, Yet moved no poet's heart, no painter's hand. For still the same strange beauty as of old Flashed forth from eyes that lit the darkening air, And still, but half confined by band of gold, Fell over shoulders smooth the Roman hair. Living! the change complete—the contrast clear. Above us shone the stars, most golden-bright. Soft lips—no statue's—whispered in my ear: Sweet heaving breast was tender-veined and white. O dead-cold bosoms! O voiceless Venus-lips! O eyes where love has slept through ages long! O waists o'er which the marble cincture slips! One warm live mouth outblossoms all your throng. Yes: then I knew that one dear red-lipped maid, Through whose sweet breathing breast live blood-throbs leap, Mocked all pale statues,—that her smile outweighed All loveliest dimples fixed in marble sleep. TO S. THORNE I. LINES WRITTEN IN MID WINTER The flowers of summer died, the winter came Clothing the hills in gloom, the fields in shame; The groves, where stride by stride the frost-king won, Pined for warm airs and clamoured for the sun. But then, with regnant charm that smote dismay And mocked June's flowers, a fairer came than they; The sweetest rose of love that e'er was born Bloomed 'mid the snow, and blossomed on a thorn! II. A NEW YEAR'S GREETING I To thee far-off beside the waves That even in winter gleam with light This greeting from a realm of night And streets like graves. II I send thee, love, the tenderest kiss That ever thrilled across the air To change December's gaunt despair To summer's bliss. III All health, all gladness, love, be thine; Bright days, soft slumbers, till we meet,— Till laughter flashes from thy sweet Young eyes on mine! IV To reach and cheer thee where thou art I send my love, best hopes I send, And New Year wishes without end, And all my heart. III. “THY LIPS ON MINE!” I When am I most at peace, when have I most Of faith in sunlit heaven and light divine, And least in death the shadowy sunless ghost? —When, all the world shut out, with thee I sit; The fire aglow, the red-shade candles lit, Thy hand in mine. II When have I most of gladness here within This stormy rain-dark town, where gas-jets shine But for full many a year no star has been? —When in thy glance I catch the sudden gleam Of far-off waves, and pass into a dream, Thine eyes on mine. III When have I most of joy's delicious throes, The unearthly joy that baffles verse and line,— Most sense of sweetness of the sovereign rose? —When towards our bower of passion I retreat And find love's mystic rapture strangely sweet, Thy lips on mine! IV. THE SIBYL I The sunless world seemed full of sound of doom; Love's reign seemed well nigh done: There came a bright-eyed sibyl through the gloom, And with her came the sun. II Upon her brow the glory of youth was set And from her eyes the morn Flashed till it pierced the clouds of sombre jet, Till laughter and song were born. III Before she came, all flowerless seemed the earth, A silent waste of woes: But with her came the silver flute of mirth And with her came the rose. IV Yea, round her footstep fell the fostering dews; Gold-girdled shone the shore; The fields were jewelled in a thousand hues, And death seemed slain once more. V. A YEAR OF LOVE I A year of love, and not one quarrel yet! Most strange it seems to some that this should be. Nothing to pain us! nothing to regret! Bright sunlight in the eyes that gaze at me! II Yet this is as it should be. Life is short: Not long enough to make a loved one weep. We love in sober earnest, not in sport; Where quiet waters flow, the stream runs deep. III Love, who hast aided where so many failed And given me rest and solace for awhile, Light in the evening skies where sunshine paled, At sunset's hour the sunrise of thy smile; IV Love, whom for thy sweet soul's sake I esteem Seeing all the truth and pureness of thine heart And in thine eyes fulfilment of love's dream, Peace follows thee and sojourns where thou art. V Thine hazel eyes, so trustful and serene, Have wondrous power to soothe me and to bless. The night needs stars: I need thee, O my queen,— Thy look, thy laughter, and thy soft caress. VI Life unto me is now an open scroll; Life to thine eyes is still a tale unread: I can expound life's mysteries to thy soul And guard, while worshipping, thy young proud head. VII In all thy pride of beauty I am proud; Proud when that stately snow-white neck I see, Like some superb sweet lily untouched, unbowed, Sovereign to all, but bending over me: VIII Proud am I of the voice that rings and charms Thousands, my queen who givest the world delight; Proud am I of thy throat and rounded arms And hair more fragrant than a summer night: IX Proud am I most of all that, while dark days Have spread wide wings of gloom o'er land and sea This winter, thou with April in thy gaze Hast given the springtide of thy love to me. VI. MY “DUCHESS” I They call thee “Duchess.” Calm and proud And cold, and full of high disdain, Thou movest, starlike, through the crowd Who scoff, and scoff in vain. II They know not, these, poor soulless clods Whose vulgar touch and glance degrade, That sovereign sweetness brings a God's Most sovereign arm to aid. III They know not that the “Duchess”' power From her own jewel of pureness springs; That, while her lips are like a flower, Her chainless soul has wings. IV Be “Duchess” ever—brave and strong, Most cold to all unworthy of thee; And charm the myriads with thy song, But with thy kiss charm me! VII. SINGER AND SINGER I You sing with voice, I sing with words: But both are one In loving music like the birds And loving flowers and sun. II The voice of radiant youth is thine; Youth's glance supreme, Most sweet of all things, most divine, That makes all life a dream. III Mine only this—the while I may Before thy throne To bend, and call the dawn of day Within thy heart my own. VIII. A BIRTHDAY I “Many and many bright returns,” As runs the good old phrase, Of this thy birthday, this that burns Starlike 'mid dimmer days. II Just twenty-one! How strange it seems. I who have outlived a thousand dreams, Can I make love to one Whose dreams are just begun? III O girlish heart, thou art sublime In that thou comest straight To this the shadowed land of time From morning's timeless gate. IV Within thine eyes the morning's light Shines softly proud, superbly bright: We, gazing from afar, Seem gazing at a star. V So fair, so pure the golden rays Thy golden birthday brings; Time loves and honours such birthdays Who mocks the birth of kings. VI Time, sunless, pauses for awhile To catch one sunbeam from thy smile. I steal it!—Swift-winged rhyme Can outwit even Time. IX. “A YOUNG GIRL'S HEART” I The new spring comes again most bright; Again our London squares behold The snowdrop robed in white, The crocus crowned with gold. II But sweeter than the spring to me And thoughts of summer following after It is thine eyes to see, It is to hear thy laughter. III When summer and spring with pride and pleasure Weave buds and flowers with daintiest art, “I know a lovelier treasure” I cry,—“a young girl's heart.” A MAN'S VENGEANCE Read this letter, read it slowly. You'll remember as you read If 'tis written in blood, your action made the heart that penned it bleed: If it throbs and aches with anguish, bear in mind, remember too, That the anguish was your doing, all the soul-pangs caused by you. Take your memory to a moment when we lived as closest friends, I a toiler, you an artist following Art's impassioned ends: I immersed in daily labour, studying law with cobwebbed brain; You the rather studying woman—studying pleasure, shirking pain. From your shadowy grove of lime-trees, looking westward, you could see 'Mid the blossoms a white blossom in my garden close to me In the radiant summer evens—one than blossoms fairer far, Her my wife, my joy, my rainbow, my dim life's imperial star. For she was my heaven of fulness, rapture past all utterance deep: Her first whisper brought the sunrise, her last kiss brought softest sleep. Even her slightest laugh was music; and one knew not when she smiled If the sun shone through her glances, or an angel through a child! —Yes, you saw her and you loved her; lusted rather, should I say? Felt that here another victim gracious Art set in your way: Noble Art, so true and tender! Art who poisons countless lives,— Looks on women all as models, be they maidens, be they wives. When I saw the new look coming as her brown eyes met your own, When I felt within my spirit daily chillier, more alone, Then I knew that you were praising with an artist's eager heart The one god who knows no pity, calm-eyed blood-stained bay-crowned Art. I might see her in the sunlight, watch her beauty day by day Garbed in glowing silks and satins, radiant blue or pearly grey; I might see her,—safely shielded by her jewels, her brocade; See her glory at the noonday, covered chastely, if displayed: I might see her thus—the husband—you might see her in the gloom, Crush the blossoms that adorned her, crush her young soul's whiter bloom, Lift off jewel after jewel, till you took the fairest one That the starlight gives the lover, not the noonday, not the sun. I might see her all surrounded by a host of friends to guard, Call her wife, and yet between us find a hundred gateways barred: I might see her fair and queenly, chiding subjects from her throne In the sunshine,—you might see her in the friendlier dark, alone. I might hear her merry laughter, I might hear her lightly jest; You might see her sob with passion, be the midnight's starcrowned guest: I might hold her hand and kiss it, I might worship, I might weep; You might strain her to your bosom, hear her call you in her sleep. Yet your rapture was a moment's,—for the death-god bent and seized Her my priceless love, my darling; with desire but half appeased, While her mouth to yours was cleaving, like the sea-flower to the rock, Death's hand tore the mouths asunder, with an ice-cold sudden shock. Did a thought of me, I wonder, at that moment cross her heart, Stay the pulse and freeze the life-blood? was it that which made her start, Draw her lips from yours and, moaning, with her hand upon her side, Pass from this world in a moment, in mid-frenzy's hottest tide? Strange it was and wildly sudden. You were holding in your arms Her a living breathing woman, with the touch, the scent, that charms: In one instant all was altered; now your lust was left alone With a body pure as marble, but as breathless as the stone. Half I smiled when first I heard it. It was hard to lose her so; Hard that when the thirst was urgent, all that quenched the thirst should go; Hard that when the wine to please you, a girl's amorous mouth, was found, Death should dash the glass to pieces, spill the sweet draught on the ground. Spring would gleam again—the summer still would raise the rose from death, Not the flower-scent in her kisses, not the rose within her breath: As a lily dead and withered she the queen of lilies lay; You for ever now were vanquished, you the victor of a day. She was buried in the summer,—and the green grass closed above All the love-god's hand had fashioned, all that lust had stolen from love: But the flowers, the grass, received her—she was nineteen—with a sigh; It was early yet to join them, she was over-young to die. As I thought the matter over, as I turned it in my brain, Having nought but vengeance left me, nothing else to seek or gain, As it seemed a spirit whispered, “Let thy vengeance for a crime Monstrous, be more monstrous even; let the struggle be sublime. “Puny mortals war like mortals—as the sun-god warred of old, Crushing down the night's dim armies with his sword and shafts of gold, As the Titans fought the giants, let the deathless struggle be; Lo! a sword and shield immortal in the darkness wait for thee. “Venture down into the darkness, and observe within the tomb All that once confronted morning like a flower in fullest bloom, All that once with sovereign beauty unashamed smiled at the sun: Venture down; observe and ponder what a mortal's hand has done. “In the deep unholy darkness, under stones of monstrous size, Mixed with horror of corruption, lurk what once were sunbright eyes: In the foul and hideous darkness, by the crawling worms caressed, Lies what once was peerless sweetness, what was once a woman's breast. “'Mid the terror of the darkness, far from scents of flower and tree, Rest remains of what was sweeter than all blossoms once to thee; Heeding not the bitter North wind, nor the West wind, nor the South, Lies what lured a world to worship, what was once a woman's mouth. “In the silence of the darkness, in the blackness dense, supreme, Where no whisper now may travel, where no star may ever gleam, Rests, the one thing still unchanging though nought else unchanged be there, Raven as the raven darkness, lovely still, a woman's hair. “Ponder this, discern and heed it,—mark the thing with equal eyes; In the spring be ever mindful, when the sunlight floods the skies, When the flowers awake from dreaming and put on their robes of bloom, That, though heaven be full of splendour, it is dark within the tomb. “When in summer the blue ocean spreads its wide expanse for thee, When thy soul may daily commune with the pure soul of the sea, With the stars by night, remember there is one whom darkness bars From the joy of the wide water, from communion with the stars. “When the groves in autumn shiver, as their red leaves one by one Whirl around the waning chariot of the fast receding sun, When the waves grow fierce, remember there is one who never more Will rejoice when autumn's storm-blasts toss the pale foam on the shore. “When imperial winter lords it with his robes of spotless white, Loading every branch with blossoms than the summer's bloom more bright, Think of one who loved the winter—then remember that the snow Reigns on earth with sovereign whiteness, but grim darkness reigns below. “There the sword thou seekest flashes. Take it from the hand divine. Let the sword God's hand wields alway for one hour be poised in thine. Wouldst thou know where thou mayest find it? Venture once more through the gloom: Lo! the Avenger's sword is lying by thy dead wife in her tomb. “Yes: the sword that through the eras flashes forth and cleaves its way Through the struggling human myriads rests within a grave to-day. Stoop once more the tomb to enter. From thy dead wife's hand adored Take the bright blade never tarnished, take the living glittering sword. “Not with any rapier human shalt thou slay her slayer. No: Let him live till perfect vengeance has full time to bud and grow; Let his soul be slowly tortured—then when twenty years have sped Thou mayest challenge him to battle, thou mayest strike the body dead. “That a mortal sword can compass; but for this thou hast to wait Till the twenty years have vanished, till revenge more fierce and great Crowns with blood-red flowers of triumph her whom death's cold fingers grasp: When the heavenly sword is crimson, put it back within her clasp.' So I sought the tomb at midnight. All the clustering flowers were sweet: There were fuchsias, red geraniums,—their soft petals brushed my feet, Their pure fragrance floated round me. But their dewkissed tender bloom Well I knew could never reach her, her I worshipped in the tomb. At the flowers I gazed and loved them: she had loved all blossoms so. “Heartless flowers,” I thought, “to blossom since my loved one cannot know! How your beauty gleams triumphant, how your fragrance fills the air With delight and peace unmeasured, though it sharpens my despair!” Something touched my hand and roused me—not a cold touch but a warm. From the flowers my head I lifted. Lo! beside me stood a form. Well my whole thrilled spirit knew it; just the same old haunting grace, And the deep hair deep as darkness, framing still the imperial face. But its sweetness was the one thing, just the one thing that I knew: Sweeter still and ever sweeter the bright marvellous same smile grew: Vainly strove the waning moonlight, and the stars forsook the skies, For a softer light and lovelier shone within a woman's eyes. Then the fragrance of the blossoms grew intenser, but it seemed That with her their fragrance blended, that for her their beauty gleamed, And I knew that I was waking, that I dreamed not now nor slept: For the first time since she left me, leaning on the cross, I wept. Then I raised my head and watched her, and she spoke at last and said: “I am living and I love thee. Since I love thee, hate is dead. Since I give thee all my sweetness, thine for ever, thy reward, By this marble cross for ever leave thy vengeance and thy sword.” For a moment I stood awestruck: in my hands I hid my face. Then I looked, but all was lonely. Very silent was the place. She had vanished. Gazing Eastward, morning's first soft golden gleam Showed that hell and death and darkness had passed nightward like a dream. That was all, but that was ample. From the moment when I knew That the living woman waited, that her living soul was true, All things changed their form, their colour. All was altered by the sun As it rent the clouds proclaiming that an endless night was done. As I pondered, while the sunlight o'er the graveyard poured its flame, Every tomb was there unaltered,—yet not one tomb seemed the same. Had not she, the dead sweet woman whom I thought no God could save, Stood with living foot triumphant 'mid the blossoms on her grave? Had not she who loved all roses touched the roses by her tomb With the feet the blossoms worshipped, mixed her own white deathless bloom With the sweetness, with the whiteness, of the flowers that clustered there? Had not she who banished gladness, with the same hand slain despair? Yes: the crosses stood unaltered,—nay, transfigured every one In the pure light of the morning, in the sweet flame of the sun. What was lying beneath was simply the worn raiment of the dead; By each tomb a figure standing lifted heavenward sun-bright head. I could see the mighty army in that golden glad sunrise With my vision now exalted, with my purged illumined eyes. By one tomb a mother waited: lo! the love eternal smiled On the face that change had touched not. By the next grave stood a child. They were there, the host immortal; they were safe, and they were glad: Though I marked a hundred faces, not one face of all was sad. All the iron-bound gates I dreaded, gates that fiendlike legions guard By one hand—and it was love's hand—in one instant were unbarred. In the graves the raiment rested—set apart, just put aside, Like the robes that shine and glitter at the noonday on a bride: It is not the gorgeous raiment, not the lustrous wedding-white, That the bridegroom claims and covets on the exultant wedding-night. Star by star God shapes and shatters, but each star's task may be done When to golden dust he grinds it,—and the gold dust makes a sun. From the sun new life proceedeth, and a universe anew Soon exults with emerald leafage, ocean-wastes of boundless blue. It may be the Force that leads us, labouring on from age to age, Hath the power to cause all anguish, and the strength too to assuage. He who struck aside my fetters, changed to rapture speechless pain, In each star we see may loosen, after ages, every chain. Though vast hosts of men be martyred, though their blood be freely poured By the hands of fate that tracks them on each planet's emerald sward, Greener grows the grass, it may be: and the dead may rise again More than conquerors through the death-stroke, more than deathless through their pain. It may be the Power immortal has no power to raise or crown Till the life that seems so precious we ourselves disdain, lay down: On the eyes that search for morning everlasting light may stream; There may be, beyond earth's beauty, beauty passing thought or dream. Though the prophet, growing hoary, feels his task not wholly done; Sees the peaks his foot will tread not, gilded by the setting sun; Though he knows the dream that lured him, glorious in the morning light, Now with gentle hands must lead him towards the silence, towards the night; Though he knows that he will reap not, though his hand the seed has sown, That the brazen towers will fall not, till a mightier blast be blown, He remembers, as his sword-arm wearier grows, while eyes grow dim, That the host goes marching onward, that it tarries not for him. Onward ever towards its triumph, though the leaders' forms may fall, Moves that never-pausing army, following Freedom's trumpet-call: And the victors, when their glances scan the path by which they came, Will remember their dead leaders, iron hearts and swords of flame. I will carry out my vengeance, on myself the stroke shall fall; I who would have slain all foemen, I myself will die for all: Yes, to-morrow when the sunlight bids the blossoms smile and bloom, You will find my body lying by the cross that crowns a tomb. —Yet . . . the hardest is the highest. It is harder far to live With that sweet ghost of the darkness still elusive, fugitive; Once again mine eyes have seen her—now life's task is harder far, For mine eyes that searched the darkness, having found, have lost a star. Still to hold fast to the vision; to believe that love is near; Daily still to struggle onward, without rapture, without fear; To retain one's faith in sunset, when the sun has left the sky, In gold blossoms in white winter,—this is harder than to die. Harder, harder was it doubtless, when the risen Jesus turned Heavenward, still to toil and wrestle though the whole soul upward yearned; Harder was it, stranger was it, than the wrestle ere he came: One may grope 'mid utter darkness, one is dazed by flickering flame. None the less, 'tis life that beckons. I'll renounce, if so God wills, For the grander hope that quickens even the grand despair that kills: Setting forth by strenuous labour, earnest words or heartfelt song, That the highest noblest vengeance is to prove, and spare, the wrong. THE GOSPEL OF SCIENCE At last the silence of the years is broken; We apprehend at last creation's plan: Time's word the centuries waited for is spoken; Thought's pulpits echo with the doom of man. Our century, closing, hears with awe and wonder Truth's golden trumpet ring to heaven's blue dome,— Outgrowing Christ's love, outgrowing his Church's blunder, Sees Science lift the veil of things to come. With one hand red from labours anatomical, The other pointing to the stars on high, Science proclaims—as if the thing were comical— “Sun, moon, and stars, and man's whole race, must die!” Man in the viewless past sprang not from heaven, Gifted with angel-powers and angel-shape. Upward from slimy pulp the race has striven: Eden's fair sovereign was, no doubt, an ape. That was commencement, noble and exalted, Of Homer's, Milton's, Hugo's, Shakespeare's race. We walk. Our hairy predecessors vaulted From tree to tree with far more agile grace! Fate's blind force working through its countless creatures Blundered upon a thousand stars maybe, But on our globe by chance struck out man's features; Mixed various salts and made—by chance—the sea. Fate's blind force through all time experimenting, After exploding planets, many a one, At last succeeded, for the gas relenting In new proportions mixed—and made the sun. The trees were all results of chance expedients. A rose, that was blind Fate's most glorious flight! The scents of flowers were mixed of strange ingredients: Ten million centuries' efforts made—a mite. But one day all went wrong. Fate's yeasty crucible Boiling all over with fierce frothy flakes From elements inharmonious, irreducible To fair results, produced the venom of snakes! Chance, nought but chance! A cobra di capello, A rattle-snake, a shark, a humming-bird, A Desdemona, Iago or Othello, All sprang to being at blind Fate's casual word. And history, with its sickening sights that freeze us To silent horror, all is chance as well. Chance brought to birth a Buddha or a Jesus: A freak of thought dug the red pit of hell. However long man's work endures, it perishes, Fades in the end as surely as 'twas born: The noblest poet the heart of mankind cherishes Is as the may-fly of one summer morn. Shakespeare's immortal? While his tongue is spoken: But England's very self shall pass away, Pass to the darkness starless and unbroken, The unsounded depth that knows not night from day. All shall be wasted—effort, labour endless, Sin, suffering, virtue,—all shall be as one. Pale shall the earth be, lonely, helpless, friendless, When time chills deep the bright heart of its sun. What shall it avail that in ten thousand churches Man's soul to Christ its ceaseless tribute brings? Earth whereon Death the dark-winged vulture perches Forgets its heroes and dethrones its kings. No compensation waits in heaven for any: There is no heaven to compensate or bless. Some few were happy; but the suffering many Groan without hope, are wronged without redress. Woman is slave, and shall be slave for ever. She weeps, she toils, she sins,—this is her doom. Purity, brightness, gladness, freedom never! The streets for home, the river for a tomb. Her struggles all are fruitless. Fate will surely Maintain the sovereignty of man the strong. Poets have sung of her, and yet securely Chained with a wreath and ruined with a song. It matters little what her soul long bearing Has moaned beneath, what torments and what rod; For centuries towards the stars her cries despairing Have risen and risen, yet never reached a God! There is no God to reach, no ear to hear her, No tender heart in heaven to heed her prayer. Christ stooped, she thought, from heaven to aid and cheer her; But now that very heaven is voiceless air. The race had hope that one man had evaded The spear of Death, the universal doom, And that by Christ's victorious right hand aided Man too might reach the stars beyond the gloom. Not so! That hope ineffable and tender, That faith transfiguring man's heart with its gleam Of more than mortal light, for all its splendour Was woven in fairy-land—it was a dream. Aye, each redeemer of the race, surrounded By signs and portents, journeyed on his road: At Buddha's birth what miracles abounded! In his queen-mother's womb a strange star glowed. One system ever it is, one range of wonders; Air-castles builded, till the air-turrets fall: Till Time with but one tremor of its thunders, One slight sufficient earth-shock, levels all. The coming centuries have to love, to labour, To sing, to enjoy, to struggle, in the light. Darkness was ever miracle's near neighbour, But now thought's sunshine makes an end of night. The twentieth century's doom's exceeding dismal! It has to march, with stern-browed Truth to lead, Towards moonless plains and forest-depths abysmal, Past many a cold, once fairy-haunted, mead. No Puck to break our sleep with gambols tricksy! Night's paths, so full of music once, are mute. Within the moonlit woods no harp of pixy! No cloven-footed Faun with wanton flute! Nothing to break the dreary desolation; All secrets probed, all mystery solved at last! In truth ours is a luckless generation: Happier, I think, was almost all the past. AN ASPIRATION I Oh, where the immortal may with fiery heart Become of man's own flesh a very part, Spirit divine, Become thou mine: Stoop thou, that I may reach thee where thou art. II Thou art the Lord of all the heaven of night Where star hands on to star the undying light. Stoop thou to me As to the sea The high heaven stoops, and loves for all its might. III Thou art the Lord of all the heaven of morn When the stars shudder, for the sun is born. Yet be thou mine, Spirit divine: Regard not me, the sunless soul, with scorn. IV Thou art the Lord of all the heaven of flowers. Say to me, “Mortal, this one rose is ours; Ours, mine and thine. I bade it shine For thee,—for thee I searched a thousand bowers.” V Thou art the Lord of the eternal sea. I am one wavelet,—mix thine heart with me. Let my soul know The mighty flow Lord, of the waves of immortality. ARTISTIC LOVE Not through the poet's heart one rapture flows When love, that rules him to the end, is won. He wins the raptures of the past,—he knows The joy of deeds in old-world eras done. Nor only in fancy,—for each brain contains, Writ small but clear, the history of the race, A thousand pleasures and a thousand pains:— Thought conquers time, and passion baffles space. The magic touch of woman's hand restores With thrilling present half miraculous power The sense of all the past—its sunlit shores, The glory of its stars, its every flower. The poet breathes, when some new love pervades His being, filling life with warmth and glow, The scent of forest-firs beneath whose shades Two lovers rode a thousand years ago. He sees the very sunlight on the leaves; He hears the clank of wild hoofs that pursue: Though all the living world to-day deceives, The phantom-love within his brain is true. He sees the sunlight glisten through the grove; He sees his prize, sweet, tearful, standing there: His heart that doubts—with reason—living love Finds ghost-love faithful, and dead eyes most fair. A CONTRAST SONNET Poor was the bower of love:—within the bower One most divine with girlhood's swanlike grace; Lips proudly curved to scorn of all things base, Passion's bright bow, yet lovelier than a flower. No silken canopy,—yet within this place The holiest sense of great Love's sovereign power, Who there had prisoned for one priceless hour Immortal beauty in a mortal face. What marvels can the eternal god achieve, The god of love, who still on man bestows In hut or cottage, measureless delight. In every woman there's a hint of Eve; In every flower a soupçon of the rose; In every star one jewel of the night. A MONTH A month,—and then no more? What would the horror of the parting be When the sweet light that lightened hill and sea And shore Fled,—and returned no more! The night would come again! But thou wouldst not be waiting in the night, Tender and gentle, blossom-sweet and white, And pain Would fill the night's old fane. Again the day would break But thou wouldst not be waiting by my side, The spirit of the dawn, the morning's bride: To wake Would double all heart-ache! One month?—we should be wed For ever, married into perfect bliss: And then would come the parting, the last kiss, The red Slow blood-stream where the rent dazed soul-halves bled,— Can we face this? July 18, 1881. “THE RED ROSE HATH ITS SPLENDOUR” The red rose hath its splendour,— The lily its white gleam, And tender It floats above the stream. The sea hath sun to lighten,— The lover hath his maid To heighten Love-pleasure long-delayed. The green leaves interlacing Have the wind's subtle breath Embracing:— The poet hath but death. July 18, 1881. SUFFERING SONNET Suffering hath brought me nearer unto thee. Not till love dies, is risen love sublime. Love slain and risen again hath power to climb God's mountains, and to thread the trackless sea. Now I am dead, love, thou canst listen to me! Thou canst hear other voices in my rhyme Than reckless voices of the old past time When passion dreamed of what was ne'er to be. Now am I strong, and I can breathe the breath Unflinching from the icy lips of death And find the eyes of death a thing most fair And the strange hands of death a woman's hands That usher me towards hill-tops of far lands, And death's shroud is but as thy robing hair. 1882. FLOWER-FRAGRANCE In every flower a woman's spirit dwells, Sweet, undeveloped, undefined as yet. The dewy petals with her tears are wet: She smiles from out the softly-curving bells Or droops in fern-fronds over rustic wells; She gives the wholesome scent to mignonette; Her lips within the foxglove may be met Or in the hyacinthine honeyed cells. And still to-day the difference is there! This woman lurked within the luscious furze Millions of years ago. What lips are hers, Thrilling the lips that touch them with a rare And occult sweetness past man's power to bear. What passionate gifts the rose-woman confers! How the white lily-maiden moves and stirs Her lover to a worship like despair! The blossom-phases woman has passed through Leave signs and tokens we may recognise. This woman by the blueness of her eyes Was surely in Paradise a hare-bell blue: Another was a rose of loveliest hue, Sweet as God's dawning fancy could devise. Woman has loved us under other skies; Faithful, while era after era flew. 1885. ACTING Imagination makes the actor's art: The eager brain, the emotional swift heart That realizes all; The power to live and move and have one's being In that same sphere the audience now is seeing, Whether it be bright room, or haunted hall. Imagination, everything on this Depends: the power to feel through kiss on kiss The living passion leap; The power to magnetise oneself the first; To feel, to be, most blessed or accurst; The power of rapturous joy, the power to weep: The power to feel within some quiet room Ghost after ghost, if need be, fill the gloom With shadowy shapes and sound; The power to love as if a life depended On winning sweet lips ere the evening ended: This gift we seek. How seldom is it found! Then how the power speeds forth and holds each heart Recipient and responsive to its Art, Art being life indeed. How the spectators hush their souls to hear, Yea, listen with the spirit's intense ear, When a real genius-spirit takes the lead. 1885. LONDON IN NOVEMBER Long streets of omnipresent fog and gloom: A very hell, wherethrough there move to doom Strange figures ceaseless. O for one flower, one rose, one sea-gull's flight, To bring me visions of vast air and light, For here I wander sad-eyed, sombre, peaceless. Could any deepest hell that Dante knew Be worse than this which circles me and you In London weather? Rain, rain and fog,—and fog, and fog, and rain; Ten minutes' dismal sun—then clouds again: Till all of us turn mildewy-souled together! Nov. 4, 1885. THE SUDDEN GLANCES I seemed to see the Saviour stretched along The cruel wood. I gazed within his eyes When lo! with trembling of a sweet surprise I met the glance that changed my youth to song. The brown limbs quivered into amorous white. Each hasty blood-drop, hurrying from the blows Seemed like the round shape of a sanguine rose, And all God's face was wonderful with light. As if sweet Venus panted on a cross The body panted, and the breasts became Like breasts of Venus, yea the very same In rounded outline and in silken gloss. For every drop of blood, a flower was there; For every tear, a jewel had been earned; In the dark tresses orange lilies burned: I knew my lady's form and worshipped her. And, more than this, I knew the sacred signs Of noble love and of the cross are one; That through the dark of Calvary the sun Shall pierce, as the red arrows pierce the pines. Christ vanished, and his cross, and lo! I stood Watching my lady twine within her hair White meadow-sweet, and fern-fronds soft and fair, Beneath gold arches of an autumn wood. I turned from Palestine, and from the hill, And marked the love within my lady's eyes, And over us beheld the English skies, And nigh our feet a moorland English rill. And then our lips clung fast, but through the kiss The wild sense pulsed that Christ himself was here; That all true love-songs rise and reach his ear And call him down to share pure passion's bliss. Then the thought passed, and left me face to face With love and with my lady—only her; And with the sunlight crowning larch and fir, And with the silent magic of the place. Nov. 28, 1885. “IN THE GLAD PSALMS” In the glad psalms on Sundays ye recite In this cold loveless sunless English air Ye see not, but the poet sees the light Of passion, he knows that Bathsheba is there. ANGEL-VISION Love bringeth vision. All the world is new: The sky's clear raiment of unsullied blue; The night's robe, star-bestrewn; Each wave that gleams and curves, each flower that blows; Each scented petal of soft pink or rose; Each leaf of leafy June. We see as God and Love see. Never more Will colour now forsake the hills and shore Or light forsake the skies. Who slayeth self shall see, as angels see, The whole world in its Eden-purity With pure immortal eyes. 1886. THE CONQUEST OF DEATH The violets shudder at thee, the roses dread Along the garden-paths thy ghostly tread, O death! The sea-birds dart across the rocky narrows: Their white wings would evade thy dark-winged arrows; They would evade and shirk thy venomed breath. All things have fear of thee. The very sun Dies in the Western sea, its bright day done; The light Gives up to thee its glory, and the bloom Of every summer passes into gloom As surely as day passes into night. Yet what if all things breathe, beyond all death, Breathe with a sweeter drawing of the breath Another air than ours? What if a purpler tinge, a tenderer bloom, Suffuses violets risen from their tomb; Are there no fragrant ghosts of risen flowers? What if within the starry night of sleep Or death, all dead things win a rapture deep And nobler than of day? What if rose saith to rose, and heart to heart, “Lo! death is weak. Why should we ever part? Arise and live! Death wounds, but cannot slay.” 1886. GOD'S DIRECT VOICE God sometimes speaks through tenderest summer flowers And sometimes through the waves. He speaks throught sunlit noons, and moonlit hours: Through daisies white on graves. He speaks through Nature, and through woman's eyes And through her gentle heart: Through red autumnal leaves, through thunderous skies Wherethrough the levins dart. Obscure weak human messengers he sends To souls obscure and weak. Through bitter enemies, or foolish friends, The voice divine can speak. But unto those he loves through friend or flower God speaks not, distantly. Nay! heart to heart in some most sacred hour: They know that it is He! 1887. TWO SONNETS I. ON THE IMPENDING EXECUTION OF FLORENCE MAYBRICK This Sonnet appeared, at the time in question, in the New York Herald. This crime will darken England, and dethrone Justice.—On one side, human, prone to err, Twelve men, and men, moreover, judging her For one sin mainly—sin confessed and known. But on the other side, as hourly shown, The soul of England, greater than her laws: The voice that bids the ermined Hangman pause: The nation's sob, that deepens to a groan. Carry out the sentence? What dishonour then Shall rest for ever on the hands that slew, Though England cried, “This woman's cause is mine!” Reverse it? From the hearts of living men Honour, and time's vast tribute nobly due To those who held the helm in 'eighty-nine. Aug. 13, 1889. II. THE FIRST STONE When English justice had the strength to spare, That so the August morning might not see A woman carried to the gallows-tree For Death with huge delight to bind her there And watch her dangling in the summer air— When England felt that this crime must not be; When women said, “Be ours the penalty, So she be saved from that supreme despair;” When all the avengers vanished, one by one, No sinless hand being found to seize and fling Death's missiles, so that she was left alone, One writer In the Spectator, I regret to say. felt his task was not yet done, Looked straight at Jesus—cried, “My lord and king, Let me thy sinless servant hurl the stone!” Aug. 24, 1889. TO ARTHUR HERVEY SONNET O friend, who hast the power along with me To worship at this dim world's shadowy shrine The God whose eyes behind the shadows shine— Who knowest that Love through music speaks to thee, As I, triumphant, murmur, “It is he!” When through my soul vibrates some sudden line; Thou who canst hear the voice we call divine Speak from the stars, or thunder through the sea: There is a power within our souls to know That, though the Church's God be earless stone, Yet, armed and mighty for his overthrow, Behind him stands the deathless God we own, He who can tame the stormiest winds that blow Defiant trumpets round about his throne. Oct. 20, 1889. TWO SONNETS TO L. Cranmer-Byng I. LIFE A thousand dreams will draw thy feet aside And tempt the suffrage of thy ready lyre: Fair life will proffer thee a fair empire,— This world's wild splendour, all its power and pride. Seek thou the untrodden paths, where none may guide Save thine own soul's strong star that shines like fire: Beyond our dying century's bards aspire With Byron, be with Shelley deified. England expects far greater things from thee Than from the puny crew who chant and wail, The club their heaven, and Primrose Hill their throne. O'er wastes of thought whereon no glimmering sail Has flashed she drives thee forth, and bids thee be For ever fearless, though for ever alone. II. LOVE But yet within life's ocean there are isles Where for calm sunlit seasons thou mayest be Safe from the cold arms of the sullen sea, Press arms divine, and meet diviner smiles. White hands shall beckon through dim forest-aisles, And yet a fragrance not of flower or tree Shall lure thee forth to roam eternally: The known joy palls, the unknown joy beguiles. In some fair island under sapphire skies A woman waits, with queenly lips unkissed And heart that throbs with unacknowledged flame. That island still is wrapped in robes of mist: No dream discloses yet the heavenly eyes; Time whispers not as yet the sovereign name. Oct. 21, 1894. ON THE RUMOURED RESIGNATION OF LORD SALISBURY SONNET The last of England's statesmen! Through the haze Of mocking mirth his spirit of love shone clear, And ever one whose heart could heed might hear The great strong mandate of the former days When storm-kissed England sought not windless ways, Boastful at moments, shivering next with fear, Afraid to tack, or onward straight to steer,— Lost in dim indecision's starless maze. Who shall succeed? At England's crucial hour, When round about her snake-tongued myriads loom Eager by some wild stroke their ends to gain, Shall we entrust the realm where Freedom's flower Still finds a space and moment left for bloom To the pert cap and bells of Chamberlain? Aug. 31, 1901. WAR AND PEACE SONNET “We have not conducted the war unrighteously and cruelly. War, at its best, is an awful curse, and brings with it untold loss of blood and treasure, and the inevitable suffering of the innocent. The exigencies of the war will always require the burning of farms, and even of villages, which are used by the enemy to harass the opposing army and harbour combatants and ammunition; terrible as the farm-burning has been, it was only ordered when absolutely necessary by a British General whose character for humanity and Godliness is beyond dispute.”—The Bishop of Liverpool. “Never before has anything approaching to such wholesale and reckless destruction or abduction of families been enacted by a British army. . . . So ignorant of facts, or so blunted have become the minds of our people on the subject of the women and children that they have come to believe that the Press is justified in extolling the great kindness and liberality which have been shown to these poor prisoners.” —Sir Neville Chamberlain. So speaks the man of God, and so replies The man of war.—How strange a thing is here! The man of God o'er blood-red lists can peer: The soldier longs for peace, and sunnier skies. Confused by folly, and misled by lies, The Churchman lends the mob too ready an ear; The warrior-soul, whose record knows no fear, Knows War's nude horror, sees with prescient eyes. Remember, all, that when the Bishop pleaded And found our war on women Christianlike, “Righteous,” expedient, godly, and the rest, The Soldier rose when one stern word was needed, Alert in honour's name and truth's to strike Aside the swords the hasty Bishop blest. Sir Neville Chamberlain, who thus takes up the cause of humanity against the Bishop of Liverpool, is no puling sentimentalist or disappointed warrior. He enjoys the distinction of having been wounded more often than any other officer in the service, and his Indian record is as brilliant as that of Lord Roberts himself.”—Daily News, Aug. 30, 1901. Aug. 31, 1901. “MELODRAMATIC, OVER-SWEET.”— A Critic. SONNET The rose is over-red, the sunset-air Is over-golden, and the moonlit sea Is over-radiant, critic-friend, for thee, And the wide starlit night is over-fair,— The summer's blossom-breath too sweet to bear, Too white the snowdrop in its purity, Too rich the furze-bloom on the wind-swept lea, Too delicate the scent of flower-sweet hair. Go thou thy way in peace, and dwell with those Who, knowing not God nor woman, never knew Eternal life within the folded rose That gives her lips their fragrance and their hue. How canst thou dream what secrets these impart, Woman and God, when one in body and heart? Dec. 28, 1901. “THE GREATER NEEDS THE LESS” SONNET The greater needs the less,—and so God needs In deeper modes than we can understand Each wave's soft kiss that leaps against the land, Each rippling laugh of humblest river-reeds. Creation's loneliest smallest sob he heeds: The Eternal seeks each child's weak outstretched hand. In this is God the vast, the pure, the grand, That from star-founts the glow-worm's lamp he feeds. The tiniest golden flower is deathless part Of God who moulded and who watches all And holds the whole encircled in his heart:— No sunlit wing can soar, no foot can crawl, Without the safeguard of his eye that knows Each tenderest petal of the world's each rose. Jan. 13, 1902. TO PHILIP BOURKE MARSTON SONNET O thou whose heart, here wrapped in saddest gloom, I sought to help upon its sunless way And cheer by rumours of the golden day That waited just outside thy darkened room, Thou who now standest, conqueror of the tomb, Above all sorrow, far beyond the sway Of this dim dream of life that fills with grey Harsh scentless tints our flowers that barely bloom,— If thou canst turn aside a moment's space From high work fashioned underneath the sun Flame with the glory of thy gaze on one Who loved on earth heaven's calm within thy face: Now that for me life's brighter hours are done Hold thou my hand, while through dark paths I pace. Jan. 13, 1902. “HEROD” AND “ULYSSES” SONNET “I have been very patient.” Through my ears The wail most hopeless of that love-doomed King Herod, re-echoed, and through Time will ring And o'er Night's tides where desolation steers. Not through the grimly grand dramatic years Elizabethan, where song-giants sing, Was seen more wildly pitiful a thing Than Herod's madness, Mariamne's tears. But now, Calypso vainly on the breeze Whispering, while dreams of Ithaca gild the foam, Past islands where white arms invite to ease And softest dalliance weariest breasts that roam, Past pleasure's temples, past all rock-strewn seas, Poet, thou guidest great Ulysses home. Feb. 11, 1902. TWO SONNETS To Stephen Phillips I. “TIME'S FLOWERS AND FRUIT” This chance Life gives thee,—proudly seize it, friend: The chance to sound once more in English ears The trumpet dropped when Shakespeare and his peers Saw their long line of mighty triumphs end. Lift once again the trumpet, and extend The line of triumph. Make man's hopes and fears Thine own, the pangs and passions of the years That glimmer in the past, or still impend. Yes, England needs a singer. She requires No mere frail chanting, no sweet childish lute, But some strong soul, equal to man's desires; Through whom strange histories, dark and sad and mute, May wail their anguish, hurl their pent-up fires, That we may garner Time's lost flowers and fruit. II. “INTERPRETERS SUPREME” Interpreters supreme thine Art will find. Not in fair France, though flower-crowned France may be Art's soft-voiced slave, could women range round thee So purely fair as those by heaven designed To make thy song a garland for mankind But chiefliest for this land that, ringed by sea, Must ever even in Art divinely free Abide, love-guarded, watched by wave and wind. This all who sing, bay-wreathed in other lands, Phillips, our English bard, may wildly long, In vain, to win—that souls so sweet and strong And such sweet eyes, such lips and such white hands, Should speak their verses and expound their song:— The woman who looks the part, she understands. Feb. 11, 1902. NEMESIS SONNET In the concentration camps in South Africa fourteen thousand children died Up to the close of January, 1902. “like faded flowers.” I dreamed that England in strange far-off days Stood fiercely wrestling with embattled foes: As each fell writhing lo! another rose, And round our headlands and blue sunlit bays Brooded a sinister and smoke-stained haze. Each morning brought a prophecy of woes Fulfilled in monstrous sequence. At the close Of day the shuddering moon lit blood-red ways. At last the brave land triumphed, and the light Of morn was shining forth on hill and plain When lo! between our England and the sun Rose the pale ghosts of countless children slain; And England wholly immersed in hopeless night Fell prone, by one vast crime for ever undone. Feb. 13, 1902. A CORONATION POEM August 9, 1902 King, to-day thou takest over from the hands of Time the viewless lord More than man can dream of greatness, realms no monarch won by plot or sword. Never yet to man was given dower so strangely fair to hold and keep: Empire stretching into Empire, blue sea rolling into bluer deep. Far from this our white-cliffed island, far beyond the red sun's dying gold, Thou art king and chosen ruler, thou whom here our grey old towers behold. London stands to-day the centre of an earth that gazes at thy throne: As great friendly stars, it may be, watch to-day the tiny star we own; Small amid the constellations,—yet a mightier task may here be done By the hugely toiling races than the task of many a soulless sun. Here on earth is love and England, here on earth the sweet face of thy Queen: Here Victoria reigned, and passing, linked our land to heavens as yet unseen. Here the princely Consort laboured, as he labours still with force divine, Leading Science on to conquest, Art from noble unto nobler shrine. Here must woman be delivered from her stifling bonds of timeless wrong: Here must all that wail of children change at morning's soft kiss to a song. Not by size of stars and planets is the worth of starry toil appraised; Only by the deeds that lift them, righteous acts whereby the Soul is raised. Soul must be the same for ever, changeless through the dim night's purple hall,— Still the same, alert, progressive, plastic ever in farthest star of all; Pliant still beneath the moulding of the mighty God whose wings pervade All the ceaseless night of shadow, all the sunlit day that knows not shade. All the suns and stars united chant one chorus round God's central Throne; Unto Love they all pay homage, Love they worship, lightcrowned Love alone. Earth's vast mission who shall measure, who shall say what victories may be planned Here, our hearts but feebly guessing at the marvels wrought by mortal hand. For we men may work with angels, eyes regard us from the heights of air; Not for us alone our planet twines the pearls of morning in her hair. Nay, for angel-eyes she shineth, meet for angel-armies to behold; Radiant with her wild seas' sapphires, rich with sundawn's and with sunset's gold. Not alone she treads the ether, sister-orbs beside her pathway tread; She can gaze in loving faces, watch bright star-helms clustered round her head. But to-day her heart is joyous, for in England lordliest of her lands Ring the trumpets wild, acclaiming one who grave before an Empire stands. Loneliest heart in clamorous London, uncompanioned in his vast demesne: Yet for ever royally mated to the bright divine heart of his Queen. Lonely, in his power far-reaching: for an Empire such as he must sway Never Greek or Roman dreamed of, earth beheld its like not till to-day. Lonely: yet with millions watching, loving, praying, hoping—through the air Never yet such blessings speeded, launched upon the golden plumes of prayer. Lonely: yet with God to aid him, and the fearless hearts of England's sons; Flash of English swords, if need be, and at need the baying of England's guns. Round the blue-waved coast, if need be, such a mighty chant as never of yore Pealed from iron throats of cannon, thundering past the virgin-girdled shore. Great ancestral hearts are with him,—hearts of kings who watched our island rise First of all to starry grandeur, sunlike then confront superber skies. Souls of England's strong-brained statesmen, all are heeding, summoned from afar; Called to-day towards spheres we traverse, drawn again to this their well-loved star. Many a mighty gaze is watching, eyes beyond our surmise pure and bright Flash to-day on English faces somewhat of their own world's mystic light. Deep communion with their spirits England's King and Queen to-day may hold; Meet to-day in thought and yearning hearts that swayed their warrior-realm of old: Hearts sweet-dowered as English roses, souls who made the world-wide waves their home, Hands that held the swords that conquered, hearts that loved the storm-birds and the foam. All the future gleams before him, King of England, Ruler of the strange Mystic East no soul has fathomed, where man's dreams beyond man's vision range. Ruler of far Afric's hill-sides, where our English slain lie densely strown; Men who gave their lives for Empire, holding Empire one with Freedom's throne. Ruler of the young vast nations, who with hearts most pure and souls most free Sent their sons to aid our children, racing each with each from sea to sea. All the future gleams before him: priceless, awful is the gift Time brings To this latest English Monarch, gift undreamed-of by past queens or kings. Chance to aid at moulding England, and through England this our whole strange star Into something pure and stainless, such it may be as pure planets are. Chance of lifting upward, heavenward, towards the realm whence ever, grand and sweet, Bends Victoria, this her England that her star-smile loves to guide and greet. Chance of winning, when the moment comes for laying both sword and sceptre down, Even a higher than of England, even God's loyal Servant's deathless Crown. “NOT BY THE CONQUEST OF THE WORLD” Not by the conquest of the world Would England triumph most. Round such a bride her strong arms furled Would find that bride a ghost. Not by grim victories in far lands And streams that run with gore And wild blows dealt by savage hands And countless cannons' roar: Not by the gallows planted where Should rise bright Freedom's tree; Not thus will England hold the fair Pure empire of the sea. Only by love within her eyes And peace abroad, at home; Peace here, beneath calm sunlit skies, And peace upon the foam. Feb. 14, 1902. THE INDELIBLE STAIN While London streets contain the crowd Of faces marred and sad That once were pure, and once were proud, And once were fair and glad; While through the gaslit London night These lost girl-thousands stroll, Our Empire has not won the might Its own fate to control. Lost souls, lost hearts, lost faces,—what That City's doom must be Which sees its own frail children's lot Yet will not, cannot see! Each pale recruit hell's armies gain, Woman's the blame, or men's, Stamps deep on England's robes a stain, A spot no time can cleanse. Feb. 14, 1902. “THIS EMPIRE'S CORONATION ROBES” This Empire's Coronation robes Should be the robes most bright Of all the fabrics of all globes, Most shot with sunset's light: Most beautiful, and most inwrought With wonder of all flowers; Most pure and lovely from the thought Of calm laborious hours: Most rich with glory of the dawn And splendour of the rose; White as the daisies of the lawn, White as the mountain's snows: The robes that woman's form shall wear When, perfect, pure and grand, She shines, the stars within her hair And heaven within her hand. Feb. 15, 1902. “THIS THOUGHT” This thought, upon the wondrous night When all the stars lean down To fill with jewels of great light King Edward's royal crown; This thought, when through the bowers of June, O'er land and purple deep, Beneath the sun, beneath the moon, Large sounds of triumph leap; This thought retain,—that sea and sun And England's hills and flowers Are theirs, theirs only, who hate and shun All evil's monstrous powers; This thought,—that he alone is crowned For ever king and lord Within whose conquering hands is found A true knight's stainless sword. Feb. 15, 1902. THE ANGLO-JAPANESE TREATY SONNET When Hate's black standard is at length unfurled And stored-up rancours smite thee,—when from France Springs Waterloo's for ever poisoned lance And Germany, like a huge snake uncurled, Gleams fierce and fork-tongued,—when from Russia hurled Dark armies down the Asian vales advance Pitiless, immense, barbaric,—when no glance Meets thine of friendship, not through all the world, Though bright through all the world flamed once thy flag,— Then, while the mad guns rave from crag to crag And thou art wrestling with the hosts of man, Thine armour rent even as a woman's scarf, Who shall stand by thee? This thy loving dwarf, Thy staunch ally, thy saviour, swart Japan. Feb. 14, 1902. KRITZINGER SONNET Before the gates of vengeful darkness close Ponder, O England, what thou wilt have done If thou dost hide for ever from the sun This man, perhaps the noblest of thy foes. What woman's heart can here in peace repose If this most monstrous deed, condemned of none, Makes horror's blood-stained cup at last o'er-run? Add not another to unmeasured woes. The world is watching. Let one pitying cry Ring forth from England. In the name of heaven Let mercy, not crude “justice,” win the day! Forgive: and be for many a sin forgiven. Beware lest, if this man ignobly die, Thine own soul with him take the deathward way. Feb. 25, 1902. THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR, AND ITS FRUITS What of the anguish and the bitter sorrow And all the strife and tears? Shall there be sunshine on some great to-morrow That shall atone for gaunt War's blood-red years? The hearts of women pierced, the children lying Silent, in sunless sleep: We think of these, and ask, our whole souls sighing, “Can heaven that sees eternal silence keep? “Is there no answer, comes no word to cheer us Who, lifting helpless hands, Felt grief's wild sword as keen, and death as near us And wept with those who wept in far-off lands?” Feb. 15, 1902. “BEWARE!” While woman deems herself so small, So frail, so slight a thing, There seems no hope, no hope at all: What gifts can mankind bring? God's sweetness through her eyes should shine, God's lilies in her hands; God's tenderest roses she should twine In soft pure bright hair-bands. Unless she bringeth heaven to man, Man cannot reach the sky. If woman cannot lift, who can? This earth's last hope must die. Beware, O earth! O man, beware! Beware, O woman weak! Drive not from hands and lips and hair The angel who would speak. Feb. 25, 1902. VICTOR HUGO'S CENTENARY Feb. 26, 1902. Before the sun all kingliest stars must fade. When morning's light-beams flash from glade to glade And o'er the glittering deep, When crimson dawn leaps on from land to land, Who shall the conquering sun-god's course withstand Or hold Night's castle-keep? So now to-day we hail the deathless one Who shines alone 'mid singers as the sun, Crowned for eternal years: Who reached love's utmost height, thought's lordliest goal; Who heard unmoved Fate's mightiest thunders roll Yet wept at children's tears. THE CENTENARY OF ALEXANDRE DUMAS PÈRE SONNET July 4, 1902. When many a type has vanished from the earth The souls that fiction gives us still shall live, Imperishable through seasons fugitive, Regenerate yearly with a strange new birth. Sweet spirits we loved, pure lips that rang with mirth, Faces with Beauty's priceless gifts to give,— These shall man's homage through all time receive, Tribute to theirs, and their creators' worth. Brightest of all, I sometimes think, two faces Will shine upon the future like twin stars, Full of all gifts of laughter and joy for man: One most at home in peril's deadliest places; One whom no cloud despondent ever mars; Good giant Porthos, deathless d'Artagnan. IRELAND SONNET The wild war over, England takes her rest Sick of mad bloodshed, sick too of display Of sunlit flags that preach from day to day Imperial lessons—aye, but not those best Mandates of Empire that from crest to crest Of Wordsworth's mountains thundered to the spray Of waves that wash round headland, beach and bay, Of England, by her Freedom crowned and blest. Yet what is this that rises like a wraith Standing between us and the gold-robed form Of Peace, with eyes that darken into storm And hands made red with horror of grim death? Peace? “Never Peace, never,” so Ireland saith, “Till wrong is slain by England's own right arm.” July 25, 1902. SONNETS (1902) SONNET I “HEROES HOMERIC” O mighty men and conquerors of renown, Heroes Homeric, English souls of note, For whom our sapient trusty rulers vote Rewards in wealth, and whom the people crown With adulation in the decked-out town Through which ye ride while the gay banners float From roof and window,—what if red War smote No more the veldt, but English field and down? Three years to conquer one small race ye took, Yet England deemed you worthy of high fame And paved with gold the path by which ye came Homeward, with ringing rein and jocund look! At your most dire mistakes all Europe shook With laughter, and true seers grew hot with shame. SONNET II THE EDUCATION BILL Once more in serried ranks the warriors close! On one side men whose passion is to be For ever fetterless, for ever free; Upon the other, Freedom's bitterest foes Who, while ye sleep and rulers nod and doze Would bear across the blue protesting sea Rome's weapons of ancestral devilry To brand and mar the stainless form that rose Triumphant once, and hurled Rome's myriads down, And won from heaven sublime Truth's starry crown, And saved for ever the human race from hell More dark and grim and terrible and dire Than heart can dream. Heed no pale priestly liar, Lest the world shrink to one black prison-cell. SONNET III “IN ART'S HIGH NAME” In Art's high name, in Love's name, in the name Of man and woman, loose not thou thine hold, O man, on woman! Woman, still enfold In thy white arms man's strong form without shame. Believe not Tolstoy, though the Russian's aim Be noble. Nay, in lands and epochs old The eternal truth by angels' lips was told: Woman is man's sweet heritage to claim. The truth as preached by Tolstoy is the lie Most black that yet has darkened sea and sky And robbed of every flower the fragrant land. If woman's body be a thing impure No sun can live, no star's crown can endure And falls the sceptre from the Lord's right hand. SONNET IV RE-INCARNATE ENEMIES We have lived before, and met in ancient days, Plucked golden flowers beneath strange Eastern light And watched strange stars resplendent through the night In epochs past remembrance. In thy gaze Old magic lingers, and a dream of ways Wherein wild swords once clashed in desperate fight: Footsteps have followed us—hate still would smite, And foemen's armour glitters through time's haze. O love, my wife, my darling, have we won So much to lose at length the sweet reward? Are those alive to-day whose forms abhorred, Darkling, once towered between us and the sun? O God, have mercy! Grant us power to shun To-day the vengeance of some ghostly sword. SONNET V “PALE TIME IS NOUGHT” Pale time is nought. Through era on era pass Our souls in forms enduring for awhile, Wherein we laugh and weep, and groan and smile, And struggle fresh experience to amass. But this time . . . ah! this fateful time, alas, We should have conquered hate and wrath and guile, And risen for ever upward. From the Nile Or Tiber's reeds to Thames' bright flowers and grass Through life on life we have moved,—but now to-day, God help me, dark foes bar us on our way, Foes we have vanquished in the ages dead. By strange chance aided, they spring forth again And, with an agony of speechless pain, I see them threaten thy gold peerless head. SONNET VI THE UNSEEN STRUGGLE It may be that on England's fate depends The future of the planet. Here, maybe, Beside our English hills, our English sea, Struggle vast forces for stupendous ends. Beyond our gaze the unseen strife extends, Far past the stars, to dim futurity,— And something of defeat or victory With England's mighty life our own life blends. Titanic battling earthly battle implies. Our puny cannons whisper, but huge hosts Wield the grim thunders of the awful skies. Who knows what breathless part with good or ill, With angel warriors or accurséd ghosts, England may take? The road lies open still. SONNET VII ENGLAND AND ART Be true to Art and Beauty. Milton's creed, Coldly sublime, grasps not with equal span The whole of Nature, or the whole of man: Not by such dreams now prosper or succeed Nations, whose souls and dawning spirits need Food other than pale legends Puritan. Through warmer veins the English red blood ran When Shakespeare's fire linked thought to ardent deed. From France and Italy learn the creed of Greece Renascent. Learn that form is still divine; Yea, that God's spirit speaks through curve and line Of shoulder,—that through glory and subtle scent Of woman's hair angels breathe balm and peace, On things unutterably pure intent. The late William Morris confessed himself quite unable to read Milton, on account of that poet's peculiar blending of metaphysical theology with a “cold classicalism.” “‘For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.’ 1 Cor. xi. io. This verse has been so utterly enigmatical to the translators, and so apparently contradictory to what has preceded it, that they have ventured on an explanation in the margin. ‘That is,’ they say, ‘a covering, in sign that she is under the power of her husband.’ Now the meaning of ???????, rendered ‘power’ in the authorised version, is really ‘authority.’ By no possible licence or contortion of terms can it be made to mean ‘covering.’ Still less is there anything to justify an explanation which is in palpable opposition to the words of the text. There can be no better illustration of the pride and ignorance with which man, even to our own day, insists upon woman's subjection to him, than that he should presume to put in a marginal note, which in the minds of the ignorant has almost the authority of the text itself, in explanation of the words, ‘For this cause ought woman to have authority on her head because of the angels,’ this means, ‘a covering, in sign that she is under the power of her husband.’ Had women been the translators, the explanation would have been different. The true internal significance is that woman is the connecting link between man and the angels, and that it is through her affectional atomic union with them that a channel is formed by which alone the Divine Feminine can descend to man; and the reason why the apostles were divinely impressed to forbid the women to shave their heads was, in the inverse sense, analogous to that which caused Delilah to shave the head of Samson when she wished to deprive him of his strength. There is a certain quality which pertains to the electricity that resides in hair, as to its essential atoms, of which, if I spoke further, I should only excite, still more than I have already done, the ridicule and scepticism of men of science, for it is far beyond their ken, which renders it an important factor in the transmission of force derived from those whom Paul calls ‘the angels,’ and to tamper with this transmitting medium of electric magnetic force is to limit woman's power, and therefore her authority in her own special sphere of operations, over man.”—Scientific Religion. By Laurence Oliphant. 1888. Pp. 356, 357. SONNET VIII “FOR FRANCE” It may be that the future holds for France In spite of gloom and languor and decay The golden glory of a dawn of day, An untouched fair superb inheritance. It may be that her restless eyes shall glance On flowers immortal, when in bloomless grey Regions our English yearnings fade away While death's cold waves inexorably advance. If this be so, the truth is plain to see. Through errors deadly, sins of lying and lust, France, proudly faithful to a mighty trust, Has held that God and beauty of form are one. For this her faith she deathless, it may be, Shall shame the starlight and surpass the sun. SONNET IX TO VIOLET To think that thou art hurt,—and hurt through me! Thou—unto whom each gentle flower that blows, White snowdrop, orange lily, crimson rose, Each leaf, each breath of summer o'er the sea, Brought thoughts divine with utter purity, Dreams no man's coarser spirit shares or knows; Thou—who didst in thy perfect trust repose On God's own bosom, safe eternally, So thou didst deem,—that I should wound or slay The very spirit the tender Love-God gave To lift me safely past sin and the grave, To bring me surely to his heaven at last, When I consider this, the sunlit day, Darkens, and all God's skies seem overcast. SONNET X “REMEMBER” Remember still the fate of England hangs Most dubious in the balance. Greece and Rome Had each their hour, then Time's sea, wave and foam, Swept over countless joys and countless pangs. Not yet the gate of dire ill-fortune clangs, Closed fast for ever. Who shall dream or tell What waits of golden heaven or black-browed hell In front,—of joy or pain's remorseless fangs? Guard England ever, O God whose hand has brought So far the race upon its stormy way And given to us far lands to guide and sway, And the sea's soul for helpmate and for bride. Grant us the spirit of ceaseless prayer, that nought May weaken love, confuse us, or divide. SONNET XI “FOR GOOD OR EVIL” For good or evil, yea for joy or shame, For bright truth spoken, or shameless folly and lie, No city ever yet beneath God's sky On God's vast womanhood put in a claim So heavy. Christ's pure dreams and Satan's game Here blend unceasingly. More women crown With grace and beauty this our marvellous town Than earth has ever seen, or star can name. Most strange, most wonderful! O Wordsworth, bard Of womanless dim mountains, what a theme For nobler song is here in streets that teem With sweet magnetic power that can be felt By those who can their surface self discard, That Woman's magic through brain-cells may melt. SONNET XII Written on the evening of the Coronation Day of King Edward the Seventh. Aug. 9, 1902. The great day closes, full of sound and light And prayerful murmurs, and superb display. Gently the sunlit I am afraid this must be taken in a somewhat metaphorical sense The day, however, was not wholly sunless. moments steal away Into the magic moments of the night. All London flames, immeasurably bright With mimic stars in colourful array, While overhead the summer heavens are gay With nobler stars, millions in flow and flight. London, old London, city of love and crime, Grim with the sins and passions of the past, For just one moment, starry-browed, sublime Shines out, and seems divinely fair to be, Grand with supreme desire, a yearning vast As boundless heavens that meet a boundless sea. SONNET XIII “WOE TO THE MAN” Woe to the man who having touched a Bride Elect in heaven, a daughter of the spheres, To earth descends and quits his angel-peers And lives as man,—his very soul has died. He who once wandered by a seraph's side Through groves unearthly now with terror hears The wizard music that with passionate tears He heard of old, by hearing deified. I marked the voices of vast angel-hosts— And all with one terrific grim accord Cried out in Love's name, “Keen-edged is the sword That through that man's most hapless heart shall smite Who of love-commerce with an angel boasts, Unless as hers his inmost soul be white.” SONNET XIV “IS THERE REDEMPTION?” Is there redemption for the utmost crime Of having sinned against a love so sweet It sought the starriest airs with fearless feet And poured strange fragrance through the fields of time? May erring man supreme forgiveness meet, Be raised again, once more God's mountains climb, Once more the chant of deathless joy repeat And mix his song with ocean's mighty rhyme? If all be lost on earth, if hope and love And health must vanish, are there yet in store Flowers that shall perish not, but evermore Deepen in fragrance as our tired steps move Onward? May awful sorrow one day prove Of sinless life the channel and the door? SONNET XV THE SONS OF SCIENCE I sometimes with a horror past all speech Shrink from the hands of those we fondly call Truth-seeking sons of Science. God help all Whose hapless bodies come within their reach! Lies are their daily food, and lies they preach From house to house, in school or lecture hall. Their coarse foul fleshly blood-tinged hands appal: Love they disdain, and mercy they impeach. England is blinded, hood-winked once again. “Cancer research!” Unutterable crime. No truth that saves the race, no gift sublime Was ever wrenched from out the hideous pain Of writhing rabbits. Mankind will not climb To heaven through Vivisection's hell-deep drain. SONNET XVI CHRIST'S METHOD Not thus did Christ the Eternal loving King Teach truth to man. Not thus did Christ extract The core of pain, but by strong word and act, By touch of hand, by glance o'ermastering The foul disease, the dark invasive thing Within the suffering body pent and packed. Love, ever love—by love he could attract, And draw from deadliest pain its deepest sting. Learn, ye whose chosen office is to heal, That all disease is subject to the power Of Love,—that Love is as a river sweet Pouring with silvery ripples of appeal Gifts pure and priceless at our foolish feet: Health is Love's fruit and Sympathy's white flower. SONNET XVII UNIVERSE-SWEETNESS Ere love's divine ineffable embrace Be fully won, within some garden-close Drink all the fragrance of the perfect rose And let the South West breeze caress thy face. Give thou to woman the pure inmost grace Of the delicious-hearted heliotrope: Love with the rich carnation's power and scope; Let not God's blossoms worst thee in the race. See that she giveth thee within her breast The secret-scented souls of all the flowers And their strange dim heaven-message in her hair: Yea, win thou likewise from the summer air A sweetness unimagined, unconfessed Save to the starlit night's most sacred hours. SONNET XVIII I. “FOR LOVE'S SAKE” For love's sake keep thine inmost body pure: Pure not in coarse Convention's meagre sense But pure through effort terribly intense High joys to gain, whose sweetness shall endure. The sea is thine, all flowers are thine, the sure Strong sun is thine, and morning on the hills: From these win somewhat of the Force that fills The world with raptures thy soul may secure. For love's sake let not any stain abide Upon the deathless body thou mayest give Supremely splendid to a deathless Bride, With whom in God's bright mansions thou mayest live Unfound of grief for ever. Fugitive Is every joy, to pureness unallied. SONNET XIX II. “GOD'S MOTHERHOOD” Yet pure alone through Woman's breath and hands Thou must be. Not in solitude, apart, Canst thou win entrance to God's inmost heart. Through Woman pour upon God's chosen lands His streams of healing. Whoso understands Knows that the flower of life divine we meet Within her lips most saving and most sweet: Yea, guardian at the gate of heaven she stands. God's Motherhood is in her snow-white breast Wherein our souls and bodies sink to rest, There finding the repose of nerve and limb That man alone through Womanhood can know When Womanhood and woman's God bestow Themselves in union strange and pure on him. SONNET XX “CONFLICTING GODS” Conflicting gods above our bodies strive For empire. Who are we that we should think That we alone life's mighty fountains drink, That we alone are passionate and alive? Through us wild spirits struggle to arrive At their own ends, fast-forging link by link Strange chains of deeds at which our souls might shrink, It may be, to assist or to connive. Christ and the gods of Greece are battling still. Not in Miltonian giant dreams alone Satan would hurl the Lord God from his throne, But here in London night's airs leap and thrill With blasts of mad infernal trumpets blown And swords celestial flash, to save or kill. SONNET XXI “THE DIVINE FEMININE” Herein the everlasting mystery lies And its solution. Christ himself bestows Upon the world the purity that glows In woman's heart, and shines through woman's eyes. When all my soul yearned out to Grecian skies And longed to touch the ineffable pure rose Of Venus' lips, I was not wrong, God knows! I was immensely right, supremely wise. The subtle fragrance that through Venus pours And through all flowers, love-nourished by the sun, In its most pure and perfect depths is one With Life that through Christ's sacred body saves. The eternal Beauty that the poet adores On Calvary bled, and sprang from Grecian waves. SONNET XXII THE VIRGIN MARY Of old I held the grandest simplest thing Was the sweet human love, and still I hold Deep in my heart the faith I held of old, But added light the changing seasons bring. The Force that stooped from heaven a Christ to mould Was the strange Mother-power to which we cling As children,—Love that broods with dovelike wing O'er all the sorrowing earth it would enfold. The mystic dream from youth's swift gaze withheld May yet be fragrant at the very heart Of this our universe, the crown of Art, And the most sacred tenderest fact of all: The fact that God through woman's womb expelled The poison there induced through woman's fall. “WHEN THE ROSE BECOMES INCARNATE” When the rose becomes incarnate in the lips of woman, sweet Will the night's arms be to dream in and the morn's embrace to meet: When the sea's soul pours its pureness through the eyes of woman, then Will the angel flash forth godlike through the answering eyes of men. Woe to man who sees too clearly all love's mystic inner deeps, For eternal pain pursues him when he wakes or when he sleeps; Anguish changeless, everlasting,—for he knows love's heaven too well And he seeks on earth to find it, and he finds not heaven, but hell. 1902. “PERFECT SLEEP” Through woman only pure and perfect sleep, The sleep of flowers and children, can be won: The rest divine and safe that visits none Save those whose souls the hands eternal keep. 1902. “THE ANGEL” The poet sees the angel who will be Within the eyes of woman. Mystic, bright Within the face that man despises, he Perceives a glory strange, an unknown light. He sees the angel that, far centuries hence, When many a path of agony is trod, Will stand with brow superb and gaze intense Within the golden palace-walls of God. 1902. ON THE DEATH OF ÉMILE ZOLA SONNET A giant force has vanished. One who fought For Truth and calmly faced Truth's deadliest foes; Who, when all France was silent, grandly arose And slew crowned Falsehood with the sword of Thought; Who home from exile tortured Dreyfus brought And bade the huge unnameable grim woes Of him the saddest of all exiles close; Who for one soul supreme redemption wrought: He, Zola, passes forth to lands unknown. And, even as Hugo left the whole world weak And friendless for a moment, so it seemed, When round about him Death's strange starlight gleamed, So now we feel unutterably alone. Truth silenced, every paltry liar may speak. Oct. 6, 1902. HUGO AND ZOLA I. Eternal light is in the rhymes Of Hugo.—Thence the sun Beams forth on far-off lands and climes: There Love is wooed, and won. There, fairer than in all great strains That listening mankind knows, Rings forth the song of hills and plains, The chant of star and rose. II. Eternal truth is in the words Of Zola.—Thence its power Flames forth on earth's pale servile herds, To France a deathless dower. Glory to France, the land of Art, In that, vast ends to gain, She brought forth Hugo's perfect heart, Then moulded Zola's brain. Oct. 7, 1902. EIGHTEEN SONNETS (1903) SONNET I HECTOR MACDONALD This Sonnet was first published in the Scotsman. Is it that fiends whose very breaths consume Watch ever, and plan the downfall of the great? Who shall explain or fathom this man's fate Or pierce behind the veil of hell-deep gloom? If only Omdurman could have been his tomb! Majestic then through Fame's most splendid gate He would have passed. Huge must have been the hate Unseen that plotted this most piteous doom. Dead!—he who never feared a human foe. What strange Powers wrestled in this soldier's brain? What anguish throbbed with an unheard-of pain Through that proud spirit no sword-stroke could lay low? What end had Death and Death's grim hosts to gain, That such a warrior-soul should perish so? March 26, 1903. SONNET II “WHEN MACEDONIA RISES” When Macedonia rises, when the air Shivers at red deeds daily and nightly done Beneath the pitying stars, the sorrowing sun, Though here in England griefless gardens bear The rose that shines in ardent Summer's hair, The lily whose heart is Summer's wooed and won,— Praise God that here the bloodless blue streams run! That here no murdered mute eyes heavenward glare! Praise God, and humble of soul and watchful be. We are not sinless. Let no crime invoke Judgment. By breeze-swept beech and whispering oak And bright pure wavelets of our guardian sea Think of the strong land's agony if he, The Power that saves, through gloom and terror spoke. SONNET III TO A GREAT POET Now that the clouds of night seem closing round The planet, bearing horror in their train, Will England totter in the track of Spain? Will no great voice of solemn warning sound? The singer whom Italia's struggle found Divinely songful, dreams, and dreams in vain. Will Swinburne's fire of passion never again Blaze forth, awakening souls but half discrowned? The tasks are puny, low the hill-tops sought By bards who trifle in this perilous hour. Singer who so loved France, whose supreme power Mingled with Hugo's, yet one deed unwrought Remains,—to save from hideous death the flower Of England's heart, by wise death-conquering thought. SONNET IV “IN FRANCE ALONE!” I sometimes fancy in France is left alone The love of beauty.—What our world will be When foul-breathed iron-clads possess the sea That once was white-armed Venus' white-waved throne— When with one piteous cry, one deathless moan, She feels that fragrance from her rose must flee,— What then from earth will fade eternally Art dimly guesses; not the worst is known. America, with England in her wake, Worships alone success and wealth. She strives On the waste débris of uncounted lives Babels to build that shadow the daybreak And mock the stars. Vast issues are at stake. Choose well, before the hour of doom arrives. “Caste, class, reverence, hereditary right, religion, count for nothing. ‘Business’ is the object and end of existence. . . . . In many things —in transit, in telegraph and postage, in cotton and woollen work— America lags far behind England; but few can doubt that supremacy under these differing conditions is only a matter of time. The future is a change only comparable with the descent of the barbarians upon the Roman Empire; with the triumph of the machine and the race who knows how to use it, a new page will be opened in the history of the world.”—Daily News, April 3, 1903. Article on America at Work, by J. Foster Fraser. SONNET V “LOVE AND BEAUTY” But France, fair France, that held her stedfast way Mocked, cursed or preached at,—France that ever knew That deep in Beauty's form lay hid the true Secret that gives its golden life to day And sends the blue waves leaping through the bay And on the rose bestows its passionate hue,— Shall not the Power whose eyes are dawns renew Her force, and grant her Art's domains to sway? No voice replies. This only is grandly sure,— Where God and Love and Beauty and Woman are There also shines the sun, there flower and star To flower and star may beckon, bright and pure. Where Beauty is not, there darkness must endure And Death with eyes that blight, and hands that mar. SONNET VI BEAUTY AND HOLINESS Without the holy spirit of love divine No man shall ever the eyes of Beauty meet Or touch with conquering touch the lips most sweet Or see with sight assured the limbs' white line. Before us not the Vision's self shall shine Until all foes are driven in wild retreat From the soul's temple. Tread of alien feet Dismays the goddess, and pollutes the shrine. Until the inmost soul is strong and free And fair and sinless, no man shall attain The mount of victory on whose height we gain The power to grasp that Beauty must be won By kingly passion mixed with purity Divine, and deathless toil divinely done. SONNET VII TO A BROTHER POET O Friend, how rare and sweet a gift is thine! Thou canst make lustrous through the Sonnet's measure Dreams and fair thoughts that men will alway treasure, Spell-bound for ever by some golden line. Singing, thy spirit is one with powers divine Who through thy strain impart immortal pleasure, Enliven toil, add new delight to leisure, Song's flowers with Love's in magic meads combine. Guard well the gift. Frail seems the Sonnet, yet Within it dwells a force that can defy Time's deadliest hate, and watch grim nations die Itself unscathed. Thy sonnets, 'mid their peers, May live when even England's sun has set, Storm-winged with wrath, or stained with deathless tears. SONNET VIII THE WORLD-CONQUEROR Not he who wanders on the wings of steam O'er all the earth, rejoicing as the sky, The hills, the plains, the cities past him fly In one wild endless brain-bewildering gleam,— Not he who, yet more eager, yokes for team The lightnings, tamed in electricity,— Not this man wins the immortal heights that lie Beyond his soulless gaze, his sordid dream. That man is conqueror of the world of things, He holds the stars of all the heavens encased Within his hand, and rules the dark-blue waste Of sky, to whom one small bright violet brings The gift of vast imagination's wings, Who on one woman's lips all joys can taste. SONNET IX THE ELEMENTAL SOUL Strange part hath Woman with the flowers and streams And all wild wayward elemental things. O wingless man, thy partner hath bright wings O'er which the sunset plays, the rainbow gleams! The golden morn amid her tresses dreams: Straight to her heart the tender snowdrop springs. A message from the Unknown Love she brings: Mingled with scents of fairy-land she seems. The Soul that, ever-struggling, ever-chaste, Toils to be with us in these latter days, Through Woman its untold desire conveys And hints sublime of what may one day be When all the green earth by her love embraced Whispers her secret to the stars and sea. SONNET X CHRIST AND APOLLO The force of Christ, his everlasting might We need, the spirit superb that through him flows. We also need the Christ within the rose: We also need the sun-god's glance of light. No one Ideal can content us quite. Ever man's unextinguished yearning glows, Fervent and deep the more, the more he knows. Christ's hands were pierced. Apollo's limbs were white O God, whom all the universe explains, Reveals, expresses, surely thou art found Enthroned in every heart, whose shrine contains The love of thee! Not in earth's sunless fanes Art thou by hands of priests immured and bound! Free, ever, thy true worshipper remains. SONNET XI “LONDON I LOVED” How few there are on whom their City fair And sweet as Athens in the old days shines! London I loved,—her houses' smoke-veiled lines, Her towers, her sunless stream, her fog-damp air. The tiger-lily in a London square To me meant all things. What the soul divines Of mystery, thrilling through a thousand signs, This is our own,—this, fearless, we declare. London I loved,—each Park, and every tree In each, the red-billed swans, the sparrows gay, The teeming busy life of every day. Not the blue wavelets of a summer ocean Brought more of wonder and magic unto me Than human crowds in never-ending motion. SONNET XII “THE ENGLISH SPIRIT IS CHANGED” The English spirit is changed, or changing fast. Gold-worshippers, gold-seekers, we forget Heroes, to whom we owe love's deathless debt, And part, without one soul-pang, from our past. Is it that our fortune's tide hath turned at last? Is it that our star, sublime so long, hath set, Making man's history one immense regret? For England's fate involves a fate more vast. Australian valour, Canada's stern deeds, We greet on penny trumpets, with gay walls, With flaming lanterns, reeling through lewd streets Where woman perishes and no heart heeds. The nation's true pulse moves with sluggish beats, But militant madness thrills our Music Halls. SONNET XIII JOHN MORLEY Bear witness, Time, when secrets all are known, All deeds divulged, all statesmen's actions weighed, To the stern solemn protest one man made, When first red War's mad trumpet-blast was blown. One voice was heard, one great man proudly alone Stood forth, and did not fear to be afraid. Had England listened to the clear word said, Less blood-stained, firmer, might have been her throne. But ever through the records of the race, Remembered ever with pure love, will shine John Morley's fame. Not that illustrious line Who howled for war, not these can meet the face Of Freedom bending usward, nor divine The fair land's future, nor her star-path trace. SONNET XIV WILLIAM WATSON Singer, who sawest that England loved of old Was to herself and her own glory untrue,— Singer, whose passionate heart, unerring, knew That when the truculent foolish wild drums rolled It was indeed that Honour's knell was tolled,— Thou hast thy place among the nobler few Whose spirits an austere destiny pursue, Whose thoughts are flames, whose words are flawless gold. Because thy voice condemned the deadly wrong, Because thy sword flashed, quivering, from its sheath When other bards stood mute, and robed in shame, Time shall not lay one finger on thy wreath. Loud through the years shall ring thy fearless song And many lands shall reverence thy name. SONNET XV “WHERE RUSKIN DREAMED” Where Ruskin dreamed, where Southey and Wordsworth sung, Hear now the strange hoot of the motor-car! Among the mountains, watched by star on star, Hills unto which the arms of white clouds clung Soft and divine, what maddening sounds have rung! What foul petroleum-fumes stream forth and mar Morn's fragrance where morn's countless blossoms are, Or were,—in days when England's soul was young. Had Ruskin marked these conquests fully achieved, His mountain-paths profaned by poisonous smoke,— Had Wordsworth's woodlands such defilement known,— How would their great pure passionate hearts have grieved! As, humble, I grieve to see my City invoke New gods, and quit for ever her timeless throne. SONNET XVI “THE DREAM DIVINE” I sometimes feel as if the dream divine Of what fair Woman on this earth might be, A dream that ever with sweet touch gladdened me In the old days when youth and hope were mine, A dream that met me in the soft starshine Of even, or morn's sunlight o'er the sea,— I sometimes feel that, if this dream must flee, Distorted, baffled, is strong Love's design. If England fails the dream to realize,— If some pure Angel stooping from bright air Met no response within dull human eyes,— If back we have driven towards golden sunset-skies Her who had made for man the whole world fair, Death waits in front: behind us Paradise. SONNET XVII “RECORD!” Woman herself is led astray by dreams That lead the heart of man in turn astray. Oh, will Night's blackness never change to day? Shall we for ever chase elusive gleams? Endless and vain the mad pursuing seems! Soul after soul is born,—then hurled away, Whither? Will Beauty's white foot ne'er delay, Bright on an earth of flowers and sunlit streams? Eternal Beauty, whom I wildly sought When in my youth the long search first began. If all my passionate seeking counts for nought, That I was blinded by fierce light record, By over-trust, by over-zeal, a man Throughout whose heart tumultuous love was poured. SONNET XVIII A LAST WORD O England, whom my spirit longed to aid, Supremely loving every plain and hill, Each flower within green forest, each clear rill, Each thyme-sweet bank, each bower, each breeze-kissed glade, A sense of some vast mandate disobeyed Seems through my heart at this last hour to thrill With pain unutterable. My country still Thou art,—but what strange dreams thy soul degrade! Love,—honour,—justice,—these seem words most vain, Most empty now. No longer London stands Superb, with the world's sword-hilt in her hands And all the world's best thought within her brain. We have lost a prize no other Power can gain, And, crownless, court the doom of lesser lands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. XI VOX CLAMANTIS: SONNETS AND POEMS TO ENGLAND SONNET Not for a single moment must we hold That England's force is spent. Not till the sun Pales in the heavens will England's work be done. Nay the pure Sun-God, armoured all in gold, Still guides and guards us as in days of old And still the Sea's wild love-kiss may be won: The kiss She gives with passionate mouth to none Save those of knightly mark and kingly mould. Through deep-sown dangers, countless round thy road, Strive onward, England. Lift thy giant load. Whom heaven exalts no foeman can abase. God gave thee a sword omnipotent when he Left in thine hand the white hand of the Sea, And set thy soul and Freedom face to face. 1904. TWO SONNETS I THE UNIVERSE-CENTRE “The supreme end and purpose of this vast Universe was the production and development of the living soul in the perishable body of man.” —Alfred Russel Wallace, in the Fortnightly Review for March, 1903. Strange, if in truth this world of ours, so small, So grief-devoured, should the grand centre be Of that huge starry Universe we see,— The end, the chief result, the crown of all! Here is the battle fought. Here stand or fall Armies whose swords flash through eternity. We are the combatants, aye even we Whose pigmy frames the sunlit voids appal. O thought tremendous! thought that must perturb, If it be true, the tremulous soul of man! To know that fragrance of an earthly rose Through the vast flowerless scentless spaces goes Lonely, divine,—to know that Love can curb The winds, and aid or mar the cosmic plan. II “POWERS SUPREMER” Most strange, if woman's wondrous form we know So sweet on earth should be alone indeed In its pure beauty,—shaped, designed, decreed, O'er all the marvelling heavens her spell to throw. Perchance on not one other globe could grow The flowers whose fragrant force the star-hosts need. Here, here alone, can fail or can succeed Love's dream. Here passion's foam-white torrents flow. Most strange, most grand! when earthly lips are one They find within the walls of their embrace Life that will last when planets' lives are done. Two lovers standing silent, face to face, When strength divine worships diviner grace Wield powers supremer than of star or sun. “EVER MINE” SONNET As flowers the sunlit air of heaven, as night The rays that from the starland float through space, So ever doth the poet seek the face Of Beauty, his by the eternal right Of endless and unspeakable delight That makes his heart her shrine in every place; His in her fragrance, in her girlish grace, Her passionate charm, her marvel and her might. The poet follows where pure Beauty leads For she to him is as the force divine That fills with life the flowers of all the meads. O Beauty, summer's flower-sweet breath is thine! I ask no frowning help of flowerless creeds If thou art ever with me, ever mine. THE CELTIC MOVEMENT SONNET O conquered Ireland, conquered by the sword, By force, by sullen strength, by soulless deeds, Strange if at last thine own soul intercedes Even for thy conquerors! Pure and sweet reward, Divine great vengeance, if thine heart is poured Forth in wild singing o'er thine hills and meads, If England hearkens, then the whole world heeds! The Celtic harp may thrill the Saxon horde. O magic beauty in the old legend-land, O charm residing in the mystic rose, “The Secret Rose,” by W. B. Yeats. O power of passionate love that overflows, O fairies white of soul and brow and hand, Ye may reveal lost marvels, and the grand Vast silent secret of the stars disclose. “THE STERNEST HOUR” SONNET O frivolous hearts that waste your days in dreams Most weak, most futile, if the truth were known Might it not startle on her wave-washed throne England, and streak her heaven with blood-red gleams? Though all so calm, so safe, so tranquil seems, What if on us man's race, on us alone, The fate of all the Universe, sun-sown, Depends? What if we shape the stellar schemes? It may be that the sternest hour has come In all the life of all the globes we see Thronging the dark plains of eternity. Of all past ages ours may be the sum. One planet speaks amid the millions dumb, Urging huge hosts towards unknown victory. “WHEN LIFE WAS YOUNG” When life was young and love was gracious And splendid leaping waves shone spacious, How did my lyre laugh forth in glee! The pleasant world was all before me And blue June skies stooped gently o'er me, And thou wast waiting by the sea. But now the days no more in splendour Are robed, nor crimson flush is tender 'Mid branches of the spring-bright tree, And thou art gone, O woman peerless, No more youth's queen, so pure, so fearless, No more the lady of the sea. Springs shine again: but these lack wonder. The waves upon the same shores thunder And suns and stars solicit me. But all is changed. No more I enter Love's golden temple's flame-crowned centre: No more I worship by the sea. I sing,—but not the old song. Rather Red autumn leaves and fruit I gather From russet hill-side, sunburnt lea. No more in all the morning's lightness I mix my soul with shuddering whiteness Of the soft-laughing green-haired sea. Nor are sweet sounds the same for ever. The music-rush transfigures never Though once God's hand it used to be. And though the waves are blue they glow not As once they flamed divine, and show not Thy figure, shapely by the sea. If this it is to grow yet older, That all the heart may freeze and colder May frown the thickening days that flee, I'd give all knowledge and late pleasure For one sweet August evening's treasure Of moonlight o'er the old love-tinged sea. “THOU DOST ENDURE” When we are tost amid life's whirling waters Foam-crested, wild and deep, And none can charm us of earth's sweetest daughters, What refuge save in sleep? When not one rose is left, nor violet nestling In the sweet hollow way; When the far skies with black-plumed clouds are wrestling And all the seas are grey: When death is at the door and, faint and lonely, Our spirit stands apart From man and woman, seeking comfort only; When passion fails, and Art: When the bright golden glittering love-land fadeth, When woman's eyes grow dim, Is there yet One who healeth nor upbraideth And can we turn to him? Is there a Force beyond the surging waters, A Power beyond the skies, Stronger than earth's sons, gentler than her daughters, With more than woman's eyes? With tenderer than her lips, and perfect pleasure Of endless high embrace, And selfless rescuing love that knows no measure In his most awful face? When we are weary, and nought but death can find us, And dead are mortal dreams, And suns are hidden, or blaze forth but to blind us, And hushed are all the old streams: When all the flowers are withered, and the glory Of earth departs indeed, And hearts grow sere, and aging heads grow hoary, And world-pierced spirits bleed: When never again the dew falls in the meadows Quite as it fell of old, And sweet enchantment quits the evening shadows, Forsakes the sunset's gold: When friends betray, and all the world is hollow, And all the stars are pale, Whom shall we seek, and whom for Leader follow, And whom for Champion hail? What refuge save in thee, thou God most tender And infinite and high? Fold us around with more than starlike splendour, With more than sunset sky! Fill us with all thy strength, and with thy passion That, being strong, is pure. Men change. Thou changest not in mortal fashion. Hearts fail. Thou dost endure. LOVE Though all the blossoms perish, and the seas Turn grey at anger of the evening breeze: Though souls grow weary, and faint hearts turn pale: Love hath avail, love hath avail! Though men be mad with yearning unexpressed And not the farthest hill-top yields us rest: Though over endless heartless seas we sail: Love hath avail, love hath avail! Though dreams of youth with weary hearts and eyes Melt beyond mists of morn and sunset skies: Though every hope we cherished seems to fail: Love hath avail, love hath avail! Though all the deepening glory of vernal green Shall soon be but a garment that has been, Yet trees and blossoms cry, while wild winds wail, “Love hath avail, love hath avail!” The love that mixes with the heart divine As the stars seek the waves wherein they shine: Whose wings control the loud ship-shattering gale: This hath avail, this hath avail! The love that nought can dim nor turn aside, High as the sun and as the sweet sea wide: The love that deepens when time's swords assail: This hath avail, this hath avail! The love beyond all words, beyond all creeds, Pierced till it faints and wounded till it bleeds: With thorns on brow, through either hand a nail: This hath avail, this hath avail! O men that struggle towards the far dim light, Love hath the seas' pent force, the mountains' might: Feet shod with love the blue heavens' summits scale: Love hath avail, love hath avail! BEYOND Beyond the travail of earth and all its sorrow We twain may meet And watch the roses gleam on God's to-morrow Soft, fair, and sweet. By some far sea where sunlit waves are breaking One day we'll stand And all our souls shall thrill with rapture waking, Hand cleave to hand. And all the skies shall be love's pure dominion And pain shall flee With weary down-bent vanquished coal-black pinion Across the sea. And we shall heave one sigh of sweetest wonder And one of peace, While far upon the horizon grief's last thunder Rolls, soon to cease. And we shall know that all the strife is over: Ah! rest,—how sweet. How tender-soft the supple yielding clover To tired-out feet! And we shall meet each other's eyes with yearning While soft seas break Before us, the melodious shingle spurning, And lost dreams wake. Nor shall we know till the strange morning finds us That we are dead: That love's hand is as death's hand when it binds us, When grief is fled! Then, crowned with our thorn-wreath, one soul immortal, Two souls shall rise Entering eternal life's majestic portal Whose bars are skies. And heaven shall seem like one love-night whose glory Will ne'er grow cold But flame for ever o'er time's summits hoary With wings of gold. The night when first thy whiteness with me blended, Me bruised and worn: When pain was slain, and sorrow's rule was ended, And hope was born. TWO SONNETS “OUR LEADER” I “Oh, for one half-hour of Gladstone!” —The Bishop of Worcester at St. James's Hall, Sept. 29, 1903. Darkness no star can pierce, no sunny ray Of hope or life, no light of loftier dreams: Blood-torrents tinging Macedonian streams, Shed by the ravening wild hordes who obey Him who should shrink to meet the face of day. No answering flash of sudden sword that gleams: A nation puzzling over fiscal schemes And led by blindest guides for leagues astray. “Oh, for one half-hour” of the heart that spake And Tyranny with form abashed down-cowered, And lands dishonoured and white souls deflowered Saw through dense clouds a glimmer of sunshine break, Seeing England's wrath in Gladstone's gaze awake, Hearing the passionate voice divinely dowered. “OUR LEADER” II Yet is it so? May not the spirit grand Who fought a battle no soul yet has fought For England's nobler soul, who, set at nought, Contemned, rejected, lifted yet the land Towards heights we dimly now can understand,— Who in man's heart a work unheard-of wrought, Heedless of thrones, exalting Love and Thought, Discrowning Evil with his strong right hand— May not to-day that spirit superb look down From some great realm the greater for his crown Of deathless pity, and his human might? May not that spirit with England's soul to-day Commune, our Leader in the heroic way, Our Guide through grief to joy, through gloom to light? A LONDON NIGHT SONNET To-night above our City's roofs and towers The clear moon hangs within a summer sky Almost. What souls to-night with kiss and sigh Will mix wild hearts and gather passion's flowers! How through the night's dim moonlit lamplit hours Bright angels and dark angels fleeting by Will blend the joys that live, the joys that die! At Woman's touch will gleam what magic bowers? To-night, to-night, some pure soft virgin heart With all its own for love's sweet sake will part, Trusting some human spirit with love supreme. To-night...in thirty years what will night's air Behold? A face immeasurably fair? Or features fouler than hell's foulest dream? Sept. 30, 1903. THE SOUL OF ENGLAND If the strong soul from England goes, The soul that loves the weak,— The soul that in the past arose Vengeance divine to wreak; The soul that drew the loving gaze Of those who strove and fought On blood-red fields, in slippery ways, For Freedom, Peace and Thought; The soul that wept for Poland's fall, That clasped Mazzini's hand, That aye responded to a call For help by sea or land; The soul that through the voice superb Of Swinburne hailed the young Republic bursting chain and curb, The strife that Hugo sung; The soul that when the Southern slave At last was saved and free Sent o'er the blue Atlantic's wave The greeting of the sea; The soul that never, through wild years Of struggle, quite forgot The toils of others and their tears, But shared the human lot; The soul that through our women spake In tenderness supreme,— That where a heart could throb or break Found Song's divinest theme; The soul that in the ancient days Hurled Rome's attacks aside, And sought upon the ocean-ways The ocean's breast for bride; The soul that in the days to come A mightier task may find If from our love-crowned island-home Spring thoughts that lift mankind; If this the soul of England fails, All hopes have failed indeed: Before the threats of hell, heaven quails, Nor can one star succeed. 1903. A POET AND A STATESMAN SONNET “The balance of criminality seems to me to lie with the insurgent bands.” —Mr. Balfour, in the English House of Commons. If Wordsworth lived and sang, would not his verse Ring like a trumpet, rousing hearts and hands, Awaking noblest rage in listening lands, Fierce with a righteous god's most passionate curse? O statesmen, who in sentence trimmed and terse For deeds that darken heaven apologize, Do ye not shudder when a nation dies? What sun shall ever such shoreless gloom disperse? O Balfour, cease thy rhetoric! Rise and act. What great high-mettled leader ever found, While shrieking villages were burnt and sacked, While thunder of oppression shook the ground, While a fair land with hell's own hordes was packed, Life in a phrase, salvation in a sound? 1903. ARMAGEDDON SONNET The dreadful close is reached not. Flame to flame May leap, till Europe reddens into fire. Ye who to-day towards slothful calm aspire Yours is the error, yours will be the blame If retribution on the track of shame Follows, if agony's storm-sob rises higher Till the winds hearken, and the waves inquire Whence the long moan of human anguish came. From land to land the torch of war may spring And all the armies of the world may clash Together, and in one vast lightning-flash Man may behold an Armageddon bring, While suns on stars in hideous turmoil crash, The end of love, of life,—of everything. 1903. FOUNDER'S DAY AT HARROW October 8, 1903 SONNET School towering grandly on the green-leafed Hill And Chapel whence so many prayers have flown Heavenward, your calm, your hopes were once my own: Once I was with you, safe from pain and ill, Young, ardent, happy, pure in soul and will. Now I steer onward, evermore alone, See sweetest memories vanish with a moan But feel your power, a holiest influence, still. O Harrow, if my heart in those bright days Had known life's meaning better than I knew, What heights half-climbed a conqueror's steps had trod! Still would the everlasting skies be blue, The sinless nights divine with starry rays, And all the living world aflame with God. FOUR SONNETS ON MACEDONIA I ENGLAND'S MOMENT Europe awaits a mandate! Strong and clear If but the voice of nobler England sounds, The wild beast, Death, will pause upon his rounds: Mankind will hearken, starriest heaven will hear. It is no hour for weak-lipped doubts or fear For lo! the Sultan hunts with hell's black hounds. While Emperors smile, blood drips from children's wounds And horror heightens with the freshening year. Stern hearts allied can stem the crimson stream. Deep pity thrills the chivalry of France: Mazzini's land is stirring and awake. Others are moving. Shall we only dream? Can no great passion lift us from our trance? Immense the moment, and immense the stake. II A TRIPLE ALLIANCE How grand a stroke for angels to record,— That Milton's, Dante's, Hugo's warrior-lands Joined ardent hearts and crime-subversive hands And won for once Love's victory by the sword! Beyond all dreams might be those Powers' reward. From flower to flower a righteous deed expands: Fresh fruits it bears, as year by year commands And heavenlier sunlight round its path is poured. France, England, Italy,—might not these attain At last the ending of the blood-stained quest? Might not the fleets that war with wave and breeze Threaten the Turk, and in a twinkling gain Through the near East a triumph for the West Outtopping all old dull diplomacies? III TO THE POPE Vicar of Christ, who holdest in thine hand A sword far-reaching, keen to save or smite, Rise up, be strong, shed forth thy Church's light. The hosts of hell at thy supreme command May scatter, and that blood-drenched Eastern land May change its robes of red to robes of white. Plead with divine authority. Invite Kings to confer, make nations understand. Thou art the leader of an army vast, Vast on the earth, yet vaster in the skies. On saints, not only upon the living, call. Trumpet to trumpet echoing through the past Will answer. Angel-legions will arise, And Jericho's towers will totter, wall by wall. IV TO THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND Queens of fair England, England of the rose, The sunlit vale, the ocean-girdled shore, The flower-sweet fields where no gaunt cannons roar,— Queens of a land where love's heart may repose Heedless of aught save the deep peace it knows, The joys it brings, the heaven it can restore,— Think of grim agony regnant, nor ignore Measureless grief, most unexampled woes. Vast is your power and vast your influence high. Not yet your hearts have spoken as of old When pity and love and your own souls were one. Your prayers can summon, white-winged from the sky, Spirits of force undreamed-of. Speak, be bold. Banish this darkness, and relight the sun. March, 1904. “IF BUT THE DEAD WERE LIFTED QUITE” If but the dead were lifted quite To some glad land of heavenly air; If they could vanish—all that once they were At one swift stroke be riven from mortal sight; Then...then we might revere The hand that fashioned, and the hand that slew: Then might we say, “The loving soul we knew Lives on, loves on,—no trace of it is here.” Alas! a trace remains. Death doing so much, left still his task undone. Death paused,—and left a mandate to the rains, The frosts, the snows of years—the storms, the sun! May 16, 1892. “UNMOVED’ So many thoughts through my own brain have passed Since these two died, so many a silent dream! The crocus twice has dared the blast And twice the sky grown blue within the stream. Though rose may rival sister rose And year by year the splendent dahlia vie With the bright sunset-sky, And lovelier lilies on the stream repose; Though in our same old land Yet fairer women year by year may rise With unchanged charm in younger eyes, Love's sceptre still in white imperial hand; Though singers one by one May chant, when chainless thought, supreme, Prevails at last, no Church's dream, But sovereign morning's tribute to the sun; Though great deeds may abound And still through many a maddening fight Flame England's helm alight,— Though clashing swords in our green lanes may sound; Though this be so, these silent graves Will hearken not, the dead within will lie Unmoved by sunlight, clamour of the waves, Beauty of woman, thunders of the sky. JEAN RICHEPIN Darkness, darkness everlasting, so it seemed that it must be, Darkness over lake and mountain, over gulf and sunless sea, Darkness when the Master left us—when no more at Hugo's glance Morning lit with loveliest roseflush all the wakening fields of France. Fields of France and meads of England, for the singer reigned supreme, Filling all the world with sunlight, holding all hearts with his dream: When the dream at last was over, when the giant's eyes grew dim, Came the reign of death and silence; Song, it seemed, had died with him. Nature, history, love and passion, all superbly had been sung; Rude must seem all other accents, after his the sovereign tongue; Loveless all the hearts of poets, harsh their hands upon the strings, Dwarfish all the choirs of singers, pale their crowns beside the king's. So we felt for one dark moment. Then with crowns of varied gleams Flashed new stars upon the watchers, carrying on love's broken dreams. Though the Master's harp was silent, yet the lyre of Richepin spoke, And the waves and mountains listened, and the wood-nymphs smiled and woke. Singer strong and true we hail him, yet he sings not of the light; Round his brow broods stubborn darkness, and his keen gaze probes the night. Through his music rings the music, through his eyes there flames the glance, Not of Hugo but Lucretius, new to flower-bright sanguine France. Yet at this our century's ending well it is that one should rise Bold of heart to face the blackness, even the gloom of star-proof skies; Quick of ear to catch and render in his anguish-maddened strain, Not creation's hymn of triumph, but the gaunt world's groan of pain. After hosts of soft-tongued singers chanting idly “All is well!” Right it is that one should question “May not life be living hell?” Are not all things base, deceptive? what of altar and of shrine? Can a world so racked and tortured in its dark depths be divine? After Hugo wreathed with roses, crowned with sorrow Richepin came, In his heart the love that fails not, on his lips the words of flame: After summer-cradled waters, after Hugo's sunlit form, Comes the wild wail of the breakers, comes the thunder-crested storm. 1894. THIS LIFE This life is sad. The blossoms every spring, The stars, the laughing waves upon the sea, Cry, “Death is throned as your perpetual king, But life is ours, to all eternity. “Ye pass, we pass not. Every flower ye love Is endless, for its race will never die. Deathless are all the stars that smile above: Immortal are the clouds that fleck the sky. “Man only is mortal. Every soul we greet Half with pure welcome, half with mocking scorn. Man finds the beauteous earth so very sweet; So fair he finds the pink cheek of the morn. “And yet for but one moment he abides; For but one night for him the stars are grand: For but one little hour the purple tides Watch lovers strolling on the golden sand. “Yea, then the lovers pass, the tides flow on; The stars steer on across an unchanged sky. The sun to-day is that same sun which shone Ere man began to live and love,—and die. “Each flower ye love, each green fern of the dell, Each star ye worship, greets you, but each cries With the same voice that greets, ‘Farewell! Farewell’ ‘Farewell!’ the great sun calls to you, from the skies. “‘Farewell! To-morrow I shall sail in state Through viewless leagues of soft subservient air, While ye will struggle on, and war with Fate, And love and weep, and triumph and despair. “‘The next day, ye will die.’ So saith the sun, And all created things feel sad at heart To think Creation's lord, and kingliest one, Must soonest of all living powers depart. “Remember therefore, not one rose ye greet But sighs a ‘Farewell!’ from its golden core. While vanquished races from the earth retreat Stars, oceans, flowers, abide for evermore.” GONE O vales of meadow-sweet through which she wandered And hills and streams By which she pondered, And forests which awoke her girlish dreams, Are ye all heedless? She is gone for ever And sings no more, And chanteth never Where the white waves break on the golden shore. CHINESE LABOUR IN SOUTH AFRICA SONNET The slave whose wandering foot by Fate was led To British soil that very hour became A freeman. Dead, we thought, was England's fame, Dead every hope, if Liberty fell dead. But now the halo fades from England's head: We dally with dishonour. Huge our shame When the soul's prostitution we proclaim, Defiling lands where noblest blood was shed! One with the mountains, one-souled with the sea, We deemed was England, fetterless and free, For ever pure from Slavery's sordid stain. But now the yellow myriads we enslave And with their soulless toil dig Freedom's grave: Grasping at gold, damnation we attain. 1904. WORDSWORTH'S FOREBODING SONNET If “neither awful voice be heard by thee,” How were it then with England? Wordsworth knew That England, to her loftier soul untrue, Might lose the mandate of the hills and sea, That both with one voice thundered: “Liberty!” Well may we tremble lest that very fate Looms at the threshold, threatens at the gate. Is She a slave, who bade all slaves go free? If England fails—we shudder at the word, For nought indeed is left if England fails. God cannot build again his towers so high. If England fails, her passionate heart unheard, Haul down for ever bright hope's sunny sails: The stars are traitors, love's creed is a lie. 1904. THE UNPARDONABLE CRIME SONNET Never in any near or distant star Has there been wrought so strangely fair a thing As the white wondrous woman-form we sing And love. In heaven's dim regions faint and far Where the bright golden-sailed swift sun-ships are No queen is found for man the lonely king. Here throbs the heart, and here the soft arms cling. Here woman waits, for man to make or mar. The thought has terror in it. So profound Is God's pure thought of woman, so sublime, That the one vast unpardonable crime Must be to change her laughter to a moan Or fling her stainless roses to the ground, Pollute her soul, or desecrate her throne. 1904. SONGLESS SONNET In deadly silence swings the world along Through horror and through darkness to its doom. No fire heroic flashes through the gloom, No mighty star-flame of impassioned song. A wail ascends of unimagined wrong But the dead singers stir not in their tomb. Strange standards glisten, blood-stained lances loom: The righteous falter, and the base wax strong. Who will stand forth as Hugo stood of old When the great stormy music pealed and rolled From Jersey, stern, implacable, supreme; When the world knew that deathless words were spoken And that the bonds of Tyranny were broken And that God thundered through a poet's dream? 1904. THE NEW DANGER SONNET This is the danger, lest in clash of sex Battling with sex, the nobler issues sink Wholly from sight. We stand upon the brink Of deadliest peril. Satan would perplex, Confuse and harass, horrify and vex, Till Man and Woman lose the power to think Clearly, or in despairing madness drink The senses' cup, whose after-flavour wrecks. No chant of conquering Science counts for aught, No victory over starlit space and time, If Woman's true sweet self be changed indeed,— If She be harnessed to a lower creed Than that which through Christ's Resurrection taught That body and soul are deathless and sublime. 1904. THE VAIN SEARCH SONNET When from the timorous music of the day We turn despondent, asking that some lyre May wake a scintillation of the old fire That seems for ever to have passed away; When for some strong and passionate harp we pray, Some soul of pure unconquerable desire Whose heavenly might may seize and lift us higher, A soul whose mandate peoples may obey; When thus we yearn, as for some guiding star, We who most sad and lost and lonely are, We who recall the dead majestic years, Who answers? One bard wanders 'mid his flowers, Pointing towards strifeless fields and bloodless bowers: Another roars camp Ballads in our ears. 1904. ON THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD'S SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS, AGAINST CHINESE SLAVERY SONNET When England, having vanquished in the fight, While almost still the smoke-wreaths round her rolled, Lent ear to curs whose clamour is for gold And ceased to watch with passionate eyes as bright The eyes of Freedom,—then in all men's sight One Christian prelate took the pathway bold, One only, one man wandered from the fold, One fiery star flashed forth upon the night. All is not lost, while one man can be found Fearless and firm and noble as was he Who scorned the falterer's mode, the coward's plea, And, facing abject and subservient lords, Made Westminster ring bravely with the sound Of one immortal protest, Hereford's. 1904. TO A SILENT SINGER SONNET England with passionate yearning longs to hear From the grand living voice a living word Sweet as the chant that once Italia heard, Proud as the young Republic's trumpet clear, Stern as the curse that on Napoleon's ear Smote with huge portent of tremendous doom When prostrate Empire shuddered at its tomb And dawned on Paris the terrific year. Still with us dwells a spirit as great and strong As when the sunrise mingled with his song And night's dim hosts were scattered at his glance; As in the old storm-swept days when Swinburne knew, While hellward the Imperial eagles flew, The heart of Italy, the soul of France. 1904. TO THE AUTHOR OF “FOR ENGLAND” SONNET Singer, who standest forth, alone, apart, Recalling England to her nobler dreams, Strangely divine thy pure strong music seems. Thou hast the ancient fire within thy heart, Yet harrowest not the stately shrines of Art By the harsh battle-trumpet's strident screams. The voice of mountains and of mountain-streams Allures thee more than turmoil of the mart. Follow thy path with ever greatening fame And let the future England, when her eyes Open at last and this day's madness dies, Thrill at the memory of a mighty name, The name of one who, weeping at her shame, Said to her slumbering soul, “Awake, arise.” 1904. SONG'S GOAL SONNET In days like these the singer's lonely task Weighs on him sometimes with a sense of doom: Yea, life itself seems hopeless as the tomb. What hand divine with conquering touch, we ask, Shall ever tear aside Fate's awful mask? What God shall scatter stars upon the gloom Or make again the blackened dim groves bloom Or in new suns bid risen summers bask? If, when I see no English roses more And no white waves on any earthly shore, Some goal is reached through long desire and pain,— If, when far golden morns meet English eyes, The love within my Song not wholly dies, I have not wholly lived and striven in vain. 1904. LOVE ETERNAL I Still each day the glad sun rises, still its conquering light surprises Flower and flower together clinging 'mid the darkness and the dew: Still the sea with flash of greeting smiles in heaven's face, proudly meeting The gold sunshine in its robes of emerald green or sapphire blue. II Rose by rose shines out for ever, their gay groups will vanish never Filling garden after garden, scenting all the summer breeze: From the fern-lined quiet valleys still the silver streamlet sallies And the white foam flings its stainless wedding-garment o'er the seas. III Or by orb the stellar legions fill the far sky's viewless regions And the pale moon sails resplendent through the purple seas of space. Darkness still is full of fancies for the hearts that weave romances, Finding all the heavens' pure starlight in one human worshipped face. IV Still within the forest covers mix the hearts and hands of lovers, Still the lover seeks the eternal in the moment's endless bliss: Still the silences are broken by the mystic old words spoken And the rose becomes self-conscious and divine in woman's kiss. V But the souls that pass and leave us, as the swift fierce years bereave us Of our pleasures, of our gladness, of our health and hopes and ease, Where are they? What darkness holds them? What of awful light enfolds them? What of Shelley when above him closed the mantle of the seas? VI He who sang the bright world's wonder, when he heard alone the thunder And beheld alone the curving loveless white breasts of the waves, Did he then, no more a dreamer, pass to life and love supremer Than our noblest living passion in this earth of flowers and graves? VII Or did speechless terror grasp him, as the waves' hands sought to clasp him, As the flower-sweet glad earth vanished from his thoughts and from his ken,— As he turned towards one who waited, one for evermore unmated, Or yearned back in that dread moment towards a lost love once again? VIII That is what to-day we wonder, striving madly now to sunder Death's serene and sombre curtain, full of starlight or of gloom. What of sins and wild offences when the human nerves and senses Fail, or change their form and message at the gateway of the tomb? IX What of pain and expiation, what of undreamed tribulation, What of horror, what of anguish, what of darkness closing round, When the soul, a conscience only, pays for life's sins, joyless, lonely, Naked, helpless, homeless, loveless, in a realm without a sound? X What of souls for ever dying? Though we hear no groans nor crying Yet there may be round about us in the starshine, in the air, Fieriest torment past our speaking, mad revenge that fiends are wreaking On the souls we counted victors, on the faces we found fair. XI Passion changeless, love eternal! Yes: but this by hate infernal May be dogged and dogged for ever. Life's dim secrets who shall tell? Through unmeasured tribulations, on through endless incarnations Still may toil the human spirit, changing fairest heaven for hell. XII What of noblest love that perished, unredeemed, uncrowned, uncherished, In the far-off silent eras that no legend may restore? If in one life pain is boundless, what of pain's grim footsteps soundless Over years that know no limit, or on seas that know no shore? XIII Love eternal may for ever bring sweet joy that lessens never, Growing upward, upward alway, gathering flowers in heavenly meads: Love unchanging, stern and deathless, crowned with starless agony, breathless, May for ever pant pursuing a pale ghost that still recedes. XIV Oh, we apprehend so little, we who deem love's bonds are brittle, What of mystery, strange, unfathomed, lurks within the gentlest eyes! With her soul the woman holds us, when her soft embrace enfolds us, And the soul releases never, and the last kiss never dies. XV Are not lovers still abiding in some union death-deriding? Are not all stars linked together? Is not changeless law supreme? Love eternal, hate unfailing, endless struggle, hopeless wailing, Now and then one mighty vision of God's face, one marvellous gleam! XVI Is it triumph, is it terror? Is it victory over error That the human race is winning, or a larger power of pain? Is the crown of love most tender, after all, a blood-stained splendour? Is it joy or is it anguish? Is it loss or is it gain? 1904. Absit omen! SONNET (“Slain by judgment thou shalt die.” Mr. Swinburne's Sonnet, called “Czar Louis XVI. Adsit omen!”) Who shall the supreme Judge's task assume? Not wholly mean the ill-starred Louis rose Erect amid not wholly heroic foes: Dethroned, not all unmanned, he strove with doom. Wrath's lightnings bring not dawn from midnight's gloom. Slowly man's sense of larger justice grows: Hugo abides, when blood-grimed Marat goes: Heaven's true Republic builds not on the tomb. Most storm-tossed saddest spirit of all the race Has been the darkling soul men call the Czar. No flower-strewn path his wavering feet have trod. Behold within the judgment-angel's face, Than the sun's utmost flame more dreadful far, The immense unswerving awful pity of God. January 27, 1905. A DEAD PROPHET (“Je crois en Dieu.” Victor Hugo on his death-bed.) I Since the passing of the Master, death and sorrow and disaster, Grief and battle and grim horror, all before our eyes have gleamed. Since the impassioned marvellous singing through the listening world went ringing, What has time accomplished? Little—of the deeds the poet dreamed. II Still the world he loved, predicting that our strifes and aims conflicting Would be merged in peace made perfect in a nobler epoch born, Struggles on, with anguish shaken. One by one life's hopes awaken: One by one life's fair hopes perish, while the wild hours laugh in scorn. III Revolution's blood-bright glory still for Hugo closed the story Of the people's timeless sorrow, brought unmeasured hopes to birth. Then at last the strong sun's splendour forced all darkness to surrender, So he deemed, proclaiming freedom to a saved exultant earth. IV Giant faith, supreme and splendid, ever widening, vast, extended From our earth to farthest heaven,—reaching, fearless, down to hell! How we miss the word that told us that Love's arms for ever hold us, That with even the worst and saddest in the end it must be well. V To each woman, pale, heart-broken, some sweet word of new hope spoken Should bring solace everlasting, joy that deepens evermore. “Yes, at Judas' wild repentance, I would change, reverse, the sentence: I would say to Judas, ‘Enter.’ I would open wide the door.” VI Since the poet's great soul left us, since at last Time's hand bereft us Of the heart that sought grief's twilight, of the eyes that sought the sun, Since that hour the world has darkened, men in vain have yearned and hearkened For some voice of noble mandate, for some large song-victory won. VII Wars and pangs and desolation! For our sorrowing troubled nation Ceased 'mid battle's peals of thunder the Victorian vast repose. Through the forced down-beaten gateway surged in clamorous myriads straightway All the spirits that foster discord, all love's strenuous dark-browed foes. VIII Strife in Africa raged chainless,—War's steeds, foaming, frantic, reinless, Dragged their chariots over thousands and the children wailed and fell. Who shall tell us, who shall measure, what was lost of love's pure treasure, What was wasted of soul-brightness, what of heaven's heart entered hell? IX If, divine from heights above us, longing yet to serve, to love us, On our earth the soul of Hugo, angel-great, majestic, gleamed, How that pure soul must have shuddered as it watched the world unruddered Drifting towards the white-mouthed breakers, knowing Love in vain had dreamed! X Then came Macedonia's terror—doubt, betrayal, darkness, error; All the summer flowers as ever towards God's heaven their fragrance poured: But amid the flowers were wailing sobs that sought heaven unavailing, Forms that wrestled as with demons, forms that writhed upon the sword. XI Then in Eastern far-off regions mixed Japan's and Russia's legions; Human blood-drops mingled ever with the white foam on the deep: The bright moonbeams shone and sported on dead faces, weird, distorted, Thousands hurled by man's inventions into sudden blood-stained sleep. XII Once the grand voice spake in thunder, and a world in silent wonder Watched as Empire shook and tottered, as Napoleon reeled and fell. Would not Hugo's great heart darken, if to-day he had to hearken To the deepening wail of anguish of the world he loved so well? XIII Hugo's stern Republic fighting still with Rome, old feuds exciting Ever newer hate and anger in the world he thought reborn! Darkness still around us brooding, from the darkness still protruding Clustered swords we never dreamed of, not a token as yet of morn! XIV Can he bend, divinely grieving, o'er us, he who died believing That the God of love was near us? Can he reach us with a word? If a deed was done inhuman, deadly wrong to man or woman, Still his spirit, so he told us, in the thunder would be heard. XV Yes, we linger, hoping, praying that the stars their light conveying To our earth may also bring us light of hope from souls afar: That for man's redemption striving still works grandly, still surviving, One whose heart with Christ's heart mingled, one whose soul is as a star. 1904. THE BATTLE OF THE SEA OF JAPAN May 27 and 28, 1905 SONNET Great past all strength of watchers to appraise, The deed by faith and patient valour done When on Tsushima's waters sank the sun And night's grim victory followed on the day's! Before the Western nations' wondering gaze The East stood forth, and fought for life, and won. Ship by ship foundered, gun by giant gun, And a new Empire met the morning's rays. What that fierce anguish meant what tongue can tell? Fate's full desire what mortal power can name Or read the secret of the word that came Fire-winged from heaven through battle's monstrous hell? But this we know, that some vast idol fell And Nelson's land is glad at Togo's fame. TWO SONNETS AN ACTOR'S BURIAL I Sir Henry Irving died at Bradford on October 13, 1905, and was buried in Westminster Abbey on October 20. Crowned by a world whose heart his genius swayed, Through dim October light a great man goes From ceaseless labour to supreme repose: The arduous part has been superbly played. Death summoned,—and no dallying foot delayed: The curtain falls that for the long toil rose. To that strange stage no human eyesight knows He passes, trusting, hopeful, undismayed. Missing the actor changed into a friend, His London for a moment feels alone. Once more the Abbey's solemn arms extend Welcome. No sound of ringing trumpets blown Marshals this valiant spirit to his end, But Memory's hands will rear his silent throne. AN ACTOR'S BURIAL II He saw with genius' glance the future hour When England's nobler drama, nobly done, Shall on some grand ideal stage be one With English acting, a most mighty power: Heir of the age when, bursting into flower At Marlowe's touch, its passionate life begun, Beneath those heavens where Shakespeare was the sun Our drama gave to time that priceless dower. Shakespeare his debtor, Tennyson his friend, While Becket's last great words became his own, Immortal, here he met his mortal end, Treading the lampless ghostly boards alone; Destined through all the undying years to be On England's stage a deathless memory. THE ANGEL OF ENGLAND I While our puny tasks engross us, while the hearts of thousands dream, While we dally with our pleasures or our grief, Gladly, sadly, the world marches towards some destiny supreme And it may be that the fatal hours are brief. II What of England? What of glory in the future shall there be Left for England, if she loses in her turn Lordship over many peoples with the lordship of the sea,— If the fates that beckoned ever, change and spurn? III So a man may win a woman,—for an hour he guards and holds, For an hour, one fleeting moment. What avails? There are watchful foemen waiting. What his conqueror's arm enfolds May elude him, if his strength or wisdom fails. IV Lo! he wakes and she has vanished, and the world is left in dim Utter darkness, cold and starless evermore. The queen-woman once made over, wholly trusted unto him, Passes out, but pauses ghostlike at the door. V So a pause has come, a moment in our history, strange and stern, For we have to choose the pathway we will take, And we have not long to loiter, for the tide is on the turn, And a Bride's heart is our own, to win or break. VI Yea, the Spirit superb and stainless whose soft breath was on the sea And her sweetness in the roses of our land Pauses yet with love and longing. Would we have her footstep flee? Would we lose the passionate pressure of her hand? VII Not in fancy do we dream of watchful spirits who surround, Some with love, but some with hatred in their gaze. One has led us, one has loved us, one has guarded us and crowned, One has guided us through dark and devious ways. VIII But the seers whose souls can travel through the shadows and the gloom Tremble now—they see behind the figure white Darker forms that wait and threaten, evil hosts that tower and loom, And they see the sun's orb menaced by the night. IX All the world is moved to turmoil. In the northland Russia stirs: The far Eastern peoples wake to life unknown. India watches, dimly wondering what of changed doom may be hers: Europe watches, from her still unshaken throne. X Revolution's undercurrent, soundless, ever tinged with red, Flows beneath the lordly palaces of kings. Peace the Czar desired. The moonlight on white faces of his dead Glitters now, the answering vultures wave their wings. XI Poland, Finland, lightward struggle, and the Russian with the Jew Wrestles, till at last the bomb does ruthless work. O'er Armenia God looks down from ceaseless skies of sunlit blue, But he sees the dripping weapons of the Turk. XII Such the world is in this vaunted twentieth century after Christ, With the Churches chanting hymn and solemn psalm: Satan ever with the crimson-handed Sultan keeping tryst; Europe gazing, half amused and wholly calm. XIII Mighty poets dead, forgotten, mighty statesmen passed away, While we dream of gold and luxury and gain! No stern Leader whom the people with stern passion may obey: Titans vanish,—but the clamorous dwarfs remain. XIV Women changing, not to angels, English women downward drawn, English streets at night a wonder and a crime, While above our city still as ever breaks the sinless dawn Crimson, golden, not in Christ's day more sublime. XV Still the Angel's gaze upon our wanton sinful city set, Still the love supreme in lingering heart and eye Full of tender pity and yearning, one immense divine regret, One immense divine redemptive agony! XVI Yet a moment have we, yet an hour to lift to heaven our gaze: At the doorway pauses ever the white Form Who would save us, who would guide us through the future's darkling ways, Ever shining, a star-beacon, through the storm. August 14, 1904. VAE VICTIS! I Progress ever! Pure and holy shines the light of morning, slowly Brightening all that seemed so evil, changing sad things into sweet! Man the victor, man the giant, lord of all things, self-reliant, Shall be crowned with golden sunshine, darkness trembling at his feet. II But the vanquished? What of roses that the summer morn discloses Lying pale and bruised and sodden in the miry heedless way? What of violets in the hollows that no sunshine guards and follows, Lying loveless, doomed and helpless, trodden slowly into clay? III One succeeds—a thousand falter. One to marriage's white altar Brings in triumph sweet and solemn the pure footstep of his bride. With her wedding-robe around her, lo! what angel-hands have crowned her: All the summer brings its lilies, all is joy and peace and pride. IV But another, even fairer, with a wealth of passion rarer, Lovelier far, it may be, hidden in the soul's depths dark and lone, Through the horror of the passion that the lewd streets mould and fashion Will pass downward towards the blackness circling Satan's lurid throne. V Oh, the misery to perceive it, the compulsion to believe it, That for every deed of virtue wrought beneath the approving sun There is balance in some terror, some mad sin, some piteous error, Some huge triumph of the darkness, some vast evil wildly done! VI Lo! in every generation the bright daughters of the nation Bring to sweet life here in England all their purity, their power. When the blossoms flame in splendour, then girl-blossoms far more tender Bring their wealth of pure soul-fragrance, many a white or rose-flushed flower. VII Yet at that same moment, sinking deep and surely hellward, drinking With their pale wan lips for ever of a shame no tongue can tell, There are women man would die for, some that angels' souls must sigh for, Plunging downward, ever downward, while strange laughter rings from hell. VIII To the vanquished woe eternal! Yes, the sentence base, infernal, Seems in blood-red letters written on the universe's walls. For the victor gratulation, joy and songs and acclamation! Scorn and anguish never-dying for the soul that fails and falls! IX To the poet bring his laurel. Then for years dispute and quarrel Over all he loved and fought for. Take his sins, his errant deeds: Let the sun's full light embellish these, enlarge with instinct hellish; Cast them down amid the garbage where the prowling critic feeds. X Let his brave deeds be forgotten,—let them perish, rankling, rotten, Lost amid wild waves of rancour! Pour your uttermost disdain On a sin that was a sorrow, wrought, repented of to-morrow: Overlook, ignore for ever, all the love and all the pain. XI To the weak ones woe for ever! Let them rise to gladness never! Christ discerned his Father's likeness in the pure face of a child. Yet the children, how they perish! Some would succour, some would cherish: Yet the children grow life-weary, long before they even have smiled. XII Oh, our valour scientific, what avails it when terrific, Vast, unceasing, stern, tremendous, still the fight for life prevails? Yea, the gentlest sooner falling, all in vain for help are calling, All in vain, in vain for ever, for some blind god holds the scales. XIII Is the struggle of life extending to the stars,—do they too, blending Life with starry life, it may be, ever fill the fields of space, Where the thunders roar and rattle, with the din of deadliest battle, Shifting ever rank and order, changing post and task and place? XIV Might we some day wake and murmur, “Heaven, we thought secure and firmer Than the solid earth we tread on, with its ceaseless starry rays, Heaven itself is safe no longer, Change and Time have proved the stronger: Lo! uncounted starry wreckage chokes the dark sky's gulfs and bays.” XV To the weaker woe unbending! Dream of life, life never-ending: Dream again, and shudder dreaming of what endless life may be! Life with every hour a sorrow for the conquered, grief tomorrow, Deeper grief on the day after, so throughout eternity. XVI Nation after nation bleeding in the huge strife, still succeeding To another nation's riches, keeps the contest still alive. Here again the weakest perish. Not the lands the pure gods cherish, But the strongest, still the strongest, nations iron-wrought, survive. XVII Woe for ever to the weak ones, to the tenderest souls, the meek ones, To the loving, to the gentle, to the hearts that sympathize! Not on them the victory hinges, on the war-flag's blood-stained fringes Rather, on the smoke of battle and the fire-gleam in the skies. XVIII Yet...a Figure rises slowly, laurelled not, no conqueror, lowly, One too tender for the struggle, whom the world-gods slew with scorn. Has he still, that vast heart broken, one more word of love unspoken? Is his hand upon the rudder? Can his eyes foresee the morn? 1904. “A ROSE OF GOD” SONNET As life's wild battle wavers, as we wait Till over hill and valley falls the gleam Of angel armour flashing through a dream, And angel hosts through morning's golden gate Pour forth, more masterful than death or fate, Or fools found godlike in their own esteem, Or tongues with Self for their eternal theme, We cry: “Will Love's heart triumph over hate?” Yet, though tracked hard by shadows born of hell, Woman's divineness deepens. She shall be Fairer than word of living man may tell. Bright shall be fields and air, serene the sea, When forth she stands at last, grief's dim paths trod, Man's rose on earth, in heaven a rose of God. October 19, 1906. TWO SONNETS THE NOBLER WOMAN I Through age on age the eyes of woman weep, The heart of woman, infinite in power, Sorrows with summer, with the dying flower, With all bright things that fail, and fade, and sleep. From her soul's height her aspirations leap Into the void, dashed down as from a tower. Her cry of pain from wind-swept bower to bower Is as the sea's wail blown from deep to deep. Once, once, she sinned, and this tempestuous orb Whose wild lips hang upon her wondrous kiss Even at her fall was hurled to the abyss Wherein the balefires and the storms absorb Pale Eden's light that gleams, as gleam afar The amazing turrets of the morning star. THE NOBLER WOMAN II Yet when she rises, sovereign, stedfast, sure, Worshipped by angels, who seemed once alone, Swaying the epochs from her boundless throne, Supreme at last upon a planet pure,— Strong, who could so unspeakably endure,— Immortal, she whose task is to atone For death through her made human, and the moan Of multitudinous ages since the lure Of Satan drew her from her seat sublime Within the Paradise wherein man dreamed, While in his eyes the light of godship gleamed And all was love, and nought was shame or crime: Then, shall she rule superb, her high task done, And night and hell shall perish in the sun. October 21, 1906. FOUR SONNETS TO THE MEMORY OF A GREAT QUEEN I When time sinks fainting, when pain's race is run, When freedom's trumpet rings from pole to pole And crime's stupendous storm-clouds cease to roll In blood-red ridges, blotting out the sun: When spirit at last with passionate sense is one And through stern matter gleams the conquering soul: When close upon us towers the ages' goal And earth seems now a heavenly sphere begun: Then shall we know why God, who gave to France The matchless music of one song supreme, And gave to Italy grim Dante's dream, And bade the world bow down to Goethe's glance, Made Shakespeare's England stronger, fairer far Her face a warrior's, and her soul a star. TO THE MEMORY OF A GREAT QUEEN II For, here, where Marlowe saw the morning break As all the heaven of song grew golden-bright, Not since has been, nor ever will be, night. O'er England answering and for England's sake New splendour flashes, as the wild years take Their solemn farewell, or triumphal flight. Not more the beacons when, proud-sailed, in sight, The Armada watched the fiery hills awake. But stronger are we, in that surelier here The soul of Woman passes to a throne. For God led terribly through paths unknown England, that on the world superbly clear Might shine the Vision given to her alone Of Love that, knowing no ending, knows no fear. TO THE MEMORY OF A GREAT QUEEN III Here, where the spirit of Kingsley loved the air Of keen wild wintry England, where the rose In soft delight of sun and shadow grows, Veiled to the base, to loftiest angels bare, A golden passion or a white-winged prayer, The perfect love of woman proudly goes Serene along the starry road she knows, Past night's dim empires, kingdoms of despair. We, we of all men, of all lands, have seen What hope the high Victorian epoch gave, What of strange greeting from beyond the grave, What living mandate from a vanished Queen Who, while our island paths she gently trod, Looked on the face and held the hand of God. TO THE MEMORY OF A GREAT QUEEN IV We, we who watched, and felt our hearts turn cold When England mourned Victoria, seeing the skies Darken, as when a solemn sunset dies: We, who now list to selfishness grown bold And hear a new world's clamorous shout for gold, Triumphs material, gauds that trick the eyes, While barriers thicken and sensual mists arise Denser and denser, covering fold on fold The lessening heavens wherein the great souls shine: We, who have met the blood-stained thrusts of hell And felt the healing of a hand divine, Know that, though nation after nation fell, If but she follow where her sure stars sign With England and her sons it shall be well. February 12, 1907. ON THE MURDER OF THE KING AND CROWN PRINCE OF PORTUGAL Saturday, February 1, 1908 SONNET Before the first fair crocus veiled in white Or proud with stainless tints of starry gold Lifted its crest above the quickening mould, Anarchy's blossom gleamed and flamed, blood-bright. Crowned was the morning, kingless was the night. From land to land the thunder-tidings rolled Of large defiance flung with hate untold At God, and Man, and Liberty, and Light. Through the shocked world wherein alas! was done An act by murderous devils of hell decreed,— In Freedom's name, whose eyes are as the sun, From hearts that follow and from hearts that lead, From Kingdoms and Republics all at one, One voice of condemnation doth proceed. THE HIGHER ENGLAND But behold! the dark is broken with a solemn sweet word spoken: Through the night the shining ripple of a golden starlight flows. If the struggle be tremendous, yet God's power is more stupendous Than the force of even the mightiest of all unseen fiends and foes. Though the blood-stained vivisecting priests of Science, love-rejecting, Rave and rage, and fill our cities with the stench of hideous deeds; Though they bluster, God-displacing, Satan's code and creed embracing, More ignoble, more repellent than the snake amid the reeds; Though they hurl at God defiance, proud, supreme in self-reliance, Basest, foulest, falsest, filthiest, of the devil-spawned sons of time; Though they prosper for a season, rotten-ripe with lies and treason, Changing science into murder, making even research a crime; Though Rome send from hellish regions her dark-browed evasive legions With the unctuous old palaver to entice us and persuade; Though they triumph with their gilding, and their prompt cathedral-building, Striving to seduce the country they lack courage to invade; Though the world-imperial Kaiser, black Morocco's white adviser, Now his friend the Sultan shivers at the notion of extremes, Watch our fleet with eyes most jealous, ever anxious, ever zealous, Ever full of aspirations, he who lured the Boers with dreams; Though the night of Russia darken, as her serfs and peasants hearken To the teachings made emphatic by the deadly bomb they fling; Though the grim Anarchic madness, with a burst of devilish gladness, Slay for sport a prince or noble, or a statesman, or a king; Though in every Christian city, without heed or help or pity Girls whose beauty might be peerless, and whose soul might grow divine, Sink and fade and perish yearly,—not the fate God marked out clearly For his daughters, on whose foreheads he designed love's stars should shine; Though our women seek in marriage diamonds, pearls, a park, a carriage, Rank and wealth and high position,—though the lower lusts persuade; Though we seem to be declining, though huge forces are combining To cast God discrowned and swordless from the world that God's hand made; Though a poet's words appealing seem but ghostly faint cries stealing Over mist-clad fields at sunset, lost in darkening wastes of air; Though the people vaguely wonder, when they hear Song's sudden thunder, “What can ail him, what can move him, seeing that gold is always fair?” Yet immense, divine, magnific, full of glory, beatific, Shall Love's crimson awful sunrise on the planet flash and flame. Was our small star counted friendless? Nay, the constellations endless Are but sister-orbs attendant. To our planet Jesus came. Here have martyrs died unending, their pure blood with His blood blending: Round earth's shores the wild grey ocean in its chainless splendour flows. Here have iron-willed statesmen taught us. Here have prophets' souls besought us. Here hath woman won her kingdom from the kingdom of the rose. Here hath England, led and lighted by her faith for ever plighted To the fearless form of Freedom, lent to stars their crowns to wear. Here hath wood and wave and fountain, forest deep and sunlit mountain, Given our race the eternal mandate to look Godward and to dare. When each soul in full completeness wins a woman's perfect sweetness For his marriage-crown and glory, finds God's tenderness in hers, Then the haunting dreams of error that now hold us with their terror Shall melt into air and vanish o'er the distant mountain-spurs. Woman love a vivisector! Not unless we quite reject her, Wholly choose to part for ever from our helper and our bride, Can we touch the red hand dripping from the knife whose edge went ripping, Just to show its skill, the offspring from some living dog's torn side. Woman love a priest whose passion is to recreate in fashion Old and sad and dim and deadly all that England once found vile! Nay: our women's truer mandate is “Win Liberty and hand it To the waiting subject-races, widening worldward from our isle.” God the Father—so the Churches, till faith's vessel rocks and lurches, Have been preaching through the centuries, till at last there comes the close Of a sexless creed unsuited to man's yearning deeplier rooted, Grandlier soaring,—so encountering nobler friends and subtler foes. God the Mother everlasting, God the spirit of bridehood casting Round the world in tenderest passion arms that lift us from despair: God whose womanhood revealing ever deeper joys is stealing Through the stars its touch makes radiant, through the flowers its kiss makes fair: Such the God the future preaches,—God whose love victorious reaches To the depths of human anguish: not the God of hell and guile But the God who shows his creatures woman's love through woman's features, Not the Father's sword of judgment, but the Mother's sovereign smile. 1908. POEMS VICTORY I A moment I yield thee; 'tis but to shield thee The better; 'tis but to be free to proclaim To men that shall listen, soft eyes that shall glisten As thine eyes glistened, thine own sweet name. II 'Tis but to make greater our pleasure later, When both our hearts and our minds have grown. Some spirit has told me that I shall enfold thee One day, my lost one—but still mine own. III I feel, through the weary days, dismal and dreary, The far keen rapture of that embrace! Its far keen glory—when life's dull story Is quickened, by thine imperial face. IV I will be ready, my voice shall be steady, And all the airs around shall be sweet; To the dim soft bower of love's first hour We two will hasten, we twain will retreat. V There we will linger; I, the singer, Thou the singer's glory and crown; And all life's labour, and life's red sabre, In those far meadows I will lay down. TO THE UNCHANGED GOD I Thou changest never Though men change ever, Yea, veer as waves of the shifting tides; Our seasons pass, We wither as grass That lies burnt brown on the mountain's sides; But thou remainest And death disdainest,— Thy firm foot over the centuries strides. II When Rome was young Thy lips in it sung, The Grecian hill-sides caught from thee Their rose-red light Of joy; in the night Of unknown eras thou wast, and the sea Has known thee, O Lord, And its music has poured Forth for thee since ever it came to be. III Thou art in the bowers Of memory, the flowers The long years gather and treasure and keep: In first love's tender And infinite splendour, O infinite God, thine eyes too weep: And thou dost delight In the calm of the night When lovers upon thy soft breast sleep. IV Not one white rose Without thee blows, Thou art in the meadows that smile in the morn; The long grey hills Thy presence fills, And the roar of the breakers is thy strong scorn; And summer divine Is surely thine, And all its scents at thy word are born. V To-day we sing to you, Our swift songs cling to you, O world of blossoms we soon shall leave. But what of to-morrow? Will it bring sorrow? Will some for our passing sigh once and grieve? A singer to-day Like a bird on a spray Clings to the world's branch; will it receive? VI Will it receive him, Sadden or leave him,— He for a day sings, only a day; Others shall follow, Never Apollo Hath not a song-word potent to say; But what world takes them As this forsakes them, The singers whom this world's gods betray? VII We pass through the flowers, World, of your bowers, And some we gather and some disdain; We pluck in your valleys The flower-wreath that tallies Best with the song-flowers born in our strain; And then we fold Our plumelets of gold, Or of grey, and quit you; our songs remain. VIII But oh whither we Depart, to what sea With strange dark waves, what garden, what bower, Who knows or can say? What summer-sweet day Awaits us, or wintry companionless hour? What guerdon to win? What joys gathered in? What rose of new passion, unspeakable flower? IX Are there women as white In the bowers of the night Of death as in rose-hung bowers of the day? Are there faces as fair In that desolate air Where the wings of the hours hang sodden and grey? Are there mouths that can kiss? Is there infinite bliss Of love, or doth all love vanish away? X No soul can reply: From that mystical sky Come but faint murmurs, no clear voice rings Downward in answer, And but a romancer Seems each one who doubtful or arrogant brings Word from that far land, Weirder than star-land, Whence throbs all music on monstrous wings. XI For music is death, And God, and the breath Of flowers who make fragrant the death they defy; The lips of the Lord Through its cadences poured In it thunder and laugh and reward and reply; In it seas of the speech Of God on the beach Of time plunge downward from fathomless sky. XII But all else changes As time's foot ranges Pitiless, ceaseless, over our plains; His barren relentless Blossomless scentless Finger the date of our death retains; And lo! as we sing A sudden soft wing, Death's, darkens the chamber and hushed are our strains. 1880. THE WRESTLE FOR A SOUL I This I have won by my fight With the spirits of sorrow and night: To be followed, ever hereafter, By a girl's glad sinless laughter. II Through my dream I heard Her maidenly new-born word: Her virginal fresh-wrought speech. It had power my heart to reach. III And now I am well content That the veil of life be rent. For though I pass to the grave This wonderful soul I save. IV Though I, dead, pass to the night, This blossom henceforth is white. Though I am forgotten, I give To her leave to laugh and to live. TO THE REV. STOPFORD A. BROOKE, ON HIS LEAVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND Now, where the high hills are And all the airs with mountain flowers are sweet, Tread thou; the valleys yearn not for thy feet: Their wreathed mists bar The stars from thee, and thee from sight of star. Now, where the clear streams run, Seek thou with ever more familiar tread The utmost summits where the sun burns red, The strong free sun, And where in air most fair God's crowns are won. Beyond all earthly creeds Thou passest now to the utmost peak, O friend, Where in love's vision all our visions blend: Our dreams and deeds Fail us,—the undying love alone succeeds. With deep sigh of relief We watch at last the unimprisoned stars Seen face to face and not through Church-forged bars: Sweet even if brief The hour when power doth shower from sun to sheaf. The one gold autumn hour Whose glory compensates for all the year Of mingled pain and labour and swift fear; When thought to flower Springs, and the autumnal woodbine rings life's bower. To pour our souls away In passionate perfect love; this joy alone Sets the divine sweet soul on God's pure throne: This in our day We yearn and burn to compass, as we may. August 22, 1880. THE ONLY REST There is a land where roses fade not ever, Where hearts once joined in one turn traitors never, The land of death. There all is silent: through that pure dominion Flies never a bird with wandering wistful pinion And wistful breath. Our flowers betray us, fading with the summer, Each sunset darkens for the night, sure-comer, Pursues each hard: Life robs us fast of sweet familiar faces, Robs us of health, endows and then displaces Each aging bard. Beauty is sweet: tender the fair white shoulder; But beauty groweth dim,—the lips wax colder That once were warm: The flower-scent quits the neck and leaves the bosom That once was wordless wealth a bloomless blossom, Quits mouth and arm. The winter groweth apace: our loves escape us; In mantle of chill gloom the dark days drape us; The dark short days:— The old summer thoughts and dreams are no more valid; By autumn walls the autumn daisies pallid Their dank heads raise. Women we loved are weary or dead or faithless; Blossoms we loved the bleak wind leaves not scatheless, It dims their cheeks: In front of us lies mist-winged drear December; Behind, the months we care not to remember, The flower-filled weeks. So is it in life: God seems to have forgotten; The very roots of hope and faith seem rotten And rotten their leaves: Death's kingdom seemeth to our spirit lonely The one thing that abideth,—yea the only Rest man achieves. NO MORE The sweet green flowerful laughing summers coming Again shall shine; Again the June wind's subtle fingers strumming Shall shake the pine; Again the yellow-banded bee go humming O'er clover and vine. Again the long waves, wonderful in whiteness, Shall storm the shore; Again the moon pour forth her regal brightness For stars to adore; Yea, some shall love with the old unchanged heart-lightness, But we no more. Weary the world seems; like a woman colder, Whose soft lips said “I love you” yestereve,—against whose shoulder We leaned our head: She is changed to-day; and all the world's grown older! Its charm is fled! NOT CHRIST, BUT CHRIST'S GOD SONNET Though Christ we need not, yet the God of morn, The Lord of mountains and of stars, we need. Though we despise the grey-beard Church's creed, Christ we despise not,—nor his crown of thorn, Nor loving heart that took the shafts of scorn. We loathe the Church's lies, the Church's greed, But unto Christ's pure genius we give heed, Yet do no despite to the Christs unborn. The God of Christ we yearn for more than we Desire the Hebrew. 'Mid our lanes of rose,— Where the soft clinging honeysuckle grows And scents the shoreside,—by our own wild sea,— We would with God the eternal Father be;— Christ's God hath other secrets to disclose. 1881. PANTHEISTIC DREAMS SONNET What is the worth of Pantheistic dreams?— Oh, what avails it at the hour of death To mix our souls with countless roses' breath, Or with the shining June-sky's sunset-gleams, Or with the glory of blue-rippling streams? What joy is there in groping underneath The soil, to spring in roots of purple heath,— What human rapture in the moon's white beams? One hour of human life, though it be wild And mad and sinful, is a nobler spell Than long eternities in green deep dell, Or ages where the autumnal leaves are piled. The human form, degraded or defiled, Is still the human soul's one citadel. 1881. HEAVEN AND WOMAN SONNET What are ten thousand centuries unto God! Just one swift starry night, and nothing more; Just one light speedy footfall on the floor Of time: one flower beside a dusty road. So mused I in Bond Street: and the ceaseless roar Of carriages seemed like the centuries wheeling Red ranks round God's throne, with wet eyes appealing For pity,—crime on crime and war on war. Through the blue sky I gazed as in a dream:— Then my eyes fell, and in a carriage lo! An olive-skinned clear face and lips that glow With loveliest power of passion, and a gleam Of Italy in the eyes, and forehead low And shapely.—How far-off those star-thoughts seem! 1882. ONE CHANCE SONNET One life; one chance; one woman to adore; One rose to worship:—once and never again Love to our bosom with sweet tears to strain; Once to kiss soft lips on some moonlit shore: Once all our soul in music to outpour, And once to enter Passion's golden fane, And once to launch upon the stormy main Of wild Romance where poets sank of yore:— Just once, and then the end;—one chance we have, One life for singing,—then our lips are sealed, And over us the green grass of the field And the green fern-fronds and white roses wave: One life for music,—then the silent grave, And lands where never morning bugle pealed. 1881. LOVE'S IMMORTALITY SONNET Some say that passion dwindles with the years, Grows old and loses radiance,—but I say That noble love can never pass away, Made strong by pain, made perfect through its tears. Who dreads pale Time's attempts, who doubts and fears Lest noon should mar morn's promise to the day, Shall perish crownless, loveless, in the fray: When weak hearts wail, nor Love nor woman hears. Not all hell's poisonous spears or swords of flame Shall harm the soul that loves, though love seem crime In the eyes of those who love not, for his fame Shall everlasting be, his joy sublime, And Love shall write in gold his deathless name: He who would conquer Love, must conquer Time. “TO-MORROW'S ROSE” One woman doth forsake? Let not thy lone heart break. Thy lips so full of pain Fresh lips shall heal again. To-morrow's rose is fair As that which brought despair. 1881. QUESTION AND ANSWER She. He thinks me just a common wayside flower, Not fitted e'er to bloom on poet's bower: Is that not so? He. And you,—you are a rose of dainty hues Whose petals tints most exquisite suffuse: Is that not so? She. Ah no! I spread but common weary wings. But you,—you deal with grand eternal things: Is that not so? He. The grandest most eternal thing in Art Is the sweet rendering of woman's heart—She. Yes, that is so! 1881. A DEDICATION TO LOUISA S. BEVINGTON Thou art among the chief of those who lead The way; thou bringest woman's soul to bear Upon our new-world thought and mak'st it fair, Adding flower-softness to the future's creed. And thou hast taken part with those who bleed Battling amid the turrets of despair, And hast borne arrows of the high keen air,— Shafts that around thought's iciest summits speed. Therefore I singing in the early day, While yet the dew upon the grass is sweet And our hill-paths are printed by few feet, Bring thee these poems of the cloudland grey, Written on the ridge where night and morning meet, Ere the old faiths' stars have wholly passed away. THE HUMAN LITANY Christians.— Hear us, Father! since within the garden Christ wept tears of blood, be kind and pardon Numberless misdeeds: Men and Women.— Hear us, Mother! by the pangs of nations, By unknown unmeasured tribulations, By each soul that bleeds! Chr.— Hear us, Father! since thy Son sank slowly Into awful death-embrace, the Holy And the spotless King! M. and W.— Hear us, Mother! hear us by the crying Of the waste sad world in darkness lying; Help the hands that cling! Chr.— By Christ's bloody sweat and cross and passion, Father, we beseech thee mould and fashion Man to work thy will! M. and W.— Mother! though their Christ were god and prophet, Yet our modern world, he knew not of it; Knew not doubts that kill! Chr.— Father! by thy dear Son's awful anguish, Help the weary sheep that faint and languish Left on the earth alone!

M. and W.— By the cross of Man, O Mother save us! In Man's own deep red blood-ocean lave us, Till our souls are new! Chr.— Father! by the spears and mocking speeches, Lift our heart, we pray,—till heaven it reaches, Following in Christ's tread! M. and W.— By the cross of Woman, Mother, aid us: When the eyes of soulless saints betrayed us, Woman's gleamed instead! Chr.— By his slow heart-beats now nearly stopping And the pale head on the shoulder dropping, Hear us, O our Lord! M. and W.— By the strange weird glimmer of Her whiteness Mingled on the Cross with that blood-brightness,— Save from sorrow's sword!

Chr.— White is Christ: than man or woman whiter: And his eyes than mortal eyes are brighter: Hear us for his sake! M. and W.— Deeper eyes than Christ's we have among us: Shafts of fiercer pain than his have stung us; Do not our hearts break? Chr.— By the deep sweet eyes and by the splendour Of Christ's heart and all his bounty tender, Father, be our stay! M. and W.— By the heart of Man the Saviour riven, And by Woman's heart which hath forgiven, Help us on our way! Chr.— By the soul of Christ and all the treasure Of his love-deep heart that knows no measure, We beseech thee, save! M. and W.— By the grief that hallows all things human, By the double cross of Man and Woman,— Lift us from the grave! FROM CHURCH TO THE SEA I heard a preacher preach of hell With tongue that raved right well: I left the Church and sought the sea,— Its hand laid hold of me. The welcoming sea-waves bathed me round With mystic soothing sound: The stars shone forth from flameless sky; I knew hell was a lie. I knew the preacher was a liar,— He and his lake of fire: The cool sweet sea put out his lake; My worn heart ceased to ache. The living God was in the sea,— His hand laid hold of me: In all the waves that rose and fell I saw no shadow of hell. Far stretched the boundless hell-less blue; No hell-flames glittered through: Above me bent the clear night-sky; I heard no prisoners' sigh. The preacher died, and God arose Sweet in his grand repose: “Heed not these fools and liars,” he said, “Whose souls are worse than dead. “Meet Me by night beside the seas Or in the wind-waved trees And I will teach thee line by line Secrets of love's and mine.” So God spoke through the sky and sea That strange great night to me: And hell-fire ceased for evermore,— All slavish fear was o'er. THE SEA Away from leaves and bowers And love's soft summer hours, Fragrance of girls and flowers, To the sea I pass: its great waves greet me; Its salt pure strong winds meet me; I am free. Free from the town-oppression; Its ceaseless dull progression Of hot days in procession That weigh down: The glad blue waters cheer me; No flower or leaf is near me, Red or brown. No flowers are here: the breathing Wide mass of waters seething Around my feet is wreathing Flowers of foam: All other bloom forsakes me As the sweet sea's breath takes me To its home. No voice of love beseecheth: No enemy impeacheth: The grey wild water reacheth To the sky: Whatever time be bringing, To hear no sea's chant ringing Is to die. SEA-POPPIES I From preachers preaching by the sea, Good Lord, deliver me! They preach of Christ and heaven and hell, But the white sea-waves swell; I turn from heaven—and sweet the drop is— To the great gold sea-poppies! II They fill the air with fiery lies; I watch the grey clear skies: The wreaths of sea-weed sweeter smell Than their foul fumes of hell! From preachers lying by the sea, Sea-God, deliver me! III Sky-spaces stretch forth calm and far Waiting for crown of star; These preachers belch their venom out With ribald prayer and shout; From preachers blustering by the sea, Sky-God, deliver me! IV Fairer to me is one fair face Than all their gold-harped place: Blue bugloss and the pink rest-harrow Laugh at their poisoned arrow! The sun, the all-golden giant, copies The golden-cheeked beach-poppies! V From vulgar narrowing thoughts of men, Lord, lift us forth again! Stretch out thy sunlike gracious hand Over the sea and land: Blend our unfettered souls with thy Great chainless sea and sky! VI From foolish tongues belying thee, Good Lord, deliver me! Let the blue-leaved gold-faced sea-flowers That kiss the sun for hours And seek no crown and fear no hell Proclaim that all is well! A SEA-DAY The laughing waves are green and white; They surge with limitless delight; To-day What can one dream of but their might? What flower-word can one say? No thought of lady's bower of rose To-day around the rapt heart goes; To-day Before us the wide water flows Green, blue, and wild and grey. O measureless majestic sea Thou layest hand and breath on me To-day: I join the reckless plangent glee Of thy far-reaching spray. All thoughts of passion cease,—and flowers Fade out beneath these salt strong showers To-day: And all the buds on woman's bowers Fade swiftly quite away. No woman now with supple white Smooth inland body gives delight; To-day I join thy curling swirling might, Sea, filling all this bay! No woman now with massed black hair And ripe red mouth is soft and fair: To-day Thy buoyant breath fills all the air, Sea, and thy coursers play! No inland bower receives me, deep, And full of scents that lull to sleep, To-day: I stand upon the shingle steep Where gold sea-poppies stray. What is a woman to the sea Whose loving hand lays hold of me, Spray-wet: Let no white arms around me be! And yet—and yet—and yet— ANTIPHONES Christians. In wondrous white attire we stand, And round us gleams the heavenly land, And faces by sweet airs are fanned—Chorus of Greeks. And we kiss Venus' snow-white hand! Christians. Saved from the flames of raging hell With us and with our souls 'tis well; Now for the lost world sounds its knell—Chorus of Greeks. How sweet these rain-washed roses smell! Christians. No flowers of earth,—no lily or rose That in pale temporal garden blows,— Are sweet or white or pure as those—Chorus of Greeks. That Venus' flower-sweet lips disclose! Christians. Not gardens girt with earthly walls, But heavenly lustrous sun-crowned halls We have for dwelling: Venus falls—Chorus of Greeks. Nay, siluer-voiced her sons she calls! Christians. Hear us, O God! Thy face is bright And we shrink backward from its light; But Christ gives courage, power, and might—Chorus of Greeks. Her breast as moonlit foam is white! Christians. Hear us, O tender Jesus! Red Thy side is with the blood-drops shed For us upon the hill-top dread—Chorus of Greeks. Praise Venus with the golden head! AN ACTOR'S TRIUMPH I The lights, the music, and the crowd Of eager hearts and eyes:— I had failed before,—to-night I vowed To hold both weak and wise And silence all applauding loud Conventionalities, And make the house one temple deep Where men should yearn and women weep. II To-night my spirit-force should seize Their spirits,—hold them bound. I swore it;—through the scenic trees Whose green boughs waved around I gazed,—She came:—upon my knees I fell—my love was found; My love who (in the drama) fled For years, and who, I thought, was dead. III She came:—I lifted earnest gaze And all my heart grew cold; 'Twas not the actress' well-known face, But one I loved of old; (How through the crowded heated place The fiery music rolled!) I saw her,—and I saw the sea Shine, when her eyes fell swift on me. IV Ten years had passed since we had met: But her grey changeless eyes Flashed into mine and held me yet; Through the gilt walls the skies Gleamed, and a moonlit sea-shore wet Before me seemed to rise— (And still the orchestral music rolled And wound about me, fold on fold!) V For months another had been there And played that part with me: To-night this woman with the old hair And eyes,—how could it be? (And then again that beach shone fair And rolled that far-off sea In unison with all the sound Of music here that held me bound!) VI Then in a flash I saw that she This single night had come, Sent by the gods to act with me,— And wonder held me dumb; Her dark hair fluttered loose and free, Full of a strange perfume, About me,—and my heart became A godlike winged thrice-potent flame. VII This single night—no more again— (I saw it in a gleam) I held her; she would vanish then, And with her all my dream: I felt the power, the joy of men Who cross some fatal stream: My nerves were iron, stretched and strung: All heaven upon one moment hung. VIII To-night! to-night! then never more— To-night the prize must fall Unto my lot; once let me soar, Or ever, worm-like, crawl! (Gods! give me this—this, I implore— This,—or nought else at all!) Then all that crowded house to me Grew silent,—like the silent sea. IX I never acted so of old, And never shall again Have force to seize and might to mould The hearts of gazing men;— My soul grew calm and great and bold,— (Thundered the music then!) I kissed her:—and through all the din She knew I knew, and meant to win. X Her fiery lips clove fast to mine, And my fire thrilled her deep— (We saw the white waves' laughing line And the soft blossoms' sleep,— The blossoms that we used to twine) My being with one leap Sprang to a height where never yet Actor's and lover's foot was set. XI “To-night,” I whispered, “fly with me”— (How soulless seemed the Play!) I knew her sweet eyes saw the sea, She could not but obey, Mine was she this night,—nor could he, Her husband, further sway The heart that, mine throughout the years, Filled mine this night with fire and tears. XII And, when the Play was over, out We sprang,—and all the night Around me seemed to laugh and shout With mad divine delight, And the gold stars shone every doubt And tremor out of sight: We swore that next night we would be By the old white-winged love-sweet sea. XIII And next night not on any Stage We stood,—but by the deep: And passion's billows ceased to rage, And love's head fell asleep Upon her breast,—and age on age Seemed past our bower to sweep Harmless and soundless, while we lay Rapt in wild joy till dawn of day. SONNETS (1882) SONNET I MARY MAGDALENE Of all high crowns and sweet the green earth gave, Or the still height of Galilean air, Or white Jerusalem that shone so fair, Or blue Gennesaret with rippling wave, Not one was sweet or high or winged to save As hers who flooded with repentant hair Christ's feet, and brought the ointment soft and rare Of her own broken heart,—as “for his grave.” So she first saw him when his spirit rose:— And through all time, through scene on changing scene, Who is there, knowing Christ, but also knows The soiled heart made by soul-deep sorrow clean? Aye! half his deathless halo Jesus owes To the harlot: gold-haired Mary Magdalene. SONNET II TO IRELAND O Ireland, Ireland,—yet we love thee well!— Lo! thy green meadows are made foul with red Blood-stains by thine own sons' mad folly shed; The land was heavenlike: thou hast made it hell. Thou hast set murder on the lonely fell, And filled the night with shadows of the dead, And made the moonlight shudder at the tread Of monstrous deeds too horrible to tell. And this is love of Ireland! Pause and think. Would not your love on nobler pinions soar If it were taught from cowardly crimes to shrink,— Murder to hate, injustice to abhor? Ye your own chains are forging link by link, And barring on yourselves your prison-door. SONNET III A SON TO A MOTHER Ah! mother, hadst thou died when I was young I could not then have borne it. Then my eyes Would have lost sight of thee within vague skies: My youth would chiefliest of all shafts have stung. I should have seen the far blue hill-tops rise Peak above peak,—and to the lowest rung Of the celestial stair I should have clung Hopeless; or hoping but with wild surmise. But, now that I am old, I feel so near Thy dwelling. “Soon” I say with humble glee “The day will come when I shall follow thee. Thy country on my vision rises clear; The whispers of its summer winds I hear; Its populous streets I very soon shall see.” SONNET IV IN VENICE What sound is this that soundeth through the night, Like falling drops upon the marble floor, In Venice?—“Doth some tender goddess pour Dew from her finger-tips,—or sheds she bright Rose-leaves in showers upon the marble white,— Or is it but the plash of passing oar?” The sleeping husband wondered. Evermore The drops fell tinkling: many and soft and light. He woke, and stretched out hand, and it was wet When he withdrew it. Then upright he sprang! Half-naked, white and stabbed, with hair like jet, His true wife lay. A woman's footstep rang Far-off.—Oh, horror! Stabbed in her young bloom? Yes. And the worst thing was, he guessed by whom. SONNET V GOD AND WOMAN God made a woman,—and he gazed aghast For very wonder. There she stood quite white,— Naked and perfect. In the golden light Before him like a carven dream she passed. Her black hair gleamed against her shoulder bright; Backward, as ever, one quick look she cast: God watched her slowly vanish, till at last The pure superb shape glimmered out of sight. “Now do I for the first time envy Man” He said. “The woman never will be mine;” Those dark thick tresses darker than the pine And sweeter than the rose,—that body wan And soft and scented like the dim woodbine,— I cannot own for ever:—but he can.” SONNET VI FORSAKEN Shall thy divineness wither, woman fair Set in the midst of lonely desert days? Dost thou lift up to heaven thy weary gaze Yet see nought round thee but the void blue air? Have no soft lips of lover kissed thine hair? Hath thine hand never toyed with myrtle sprays? Hast thou not wandered by the green-blue bays In summer, full of dreams no heart could share? Oh, it were sin to leave thee blossoming so— Alone, unplucked, unloved:—as great a sin As to pass by some lily set within A jungle,—where with heavy gait and slow The loveless monstrous beasts lurch to and fro, Piercing the rush-beds with their gaze unclean. SONNET VII “GOD LOVES ALL THINGS” God loves all things. Yes, even the spotted snake,— The lion and tiger, and the bird of prey; The spider's white web hanging o'er the way; The pike who lurks within the weedy lake; The leopard sidling through the tangled brake; The shark who spots with blood the Southern bay; The gnats who muster at the close of day;— Can God who made, relinquish or forsake? One day the tiger shall be pure and clean From bloodshed,—and the human tiger too. What hate degraded, sweet love shall renew. Judas along with Jesus shall be seen: The priest shall cease on Satan's arm to lean, The pulpit cease to thunder to the pew. PASSION AND LOVE SONNET VIII I PASSION The sense of wrong in passion is the power That lights all passion: 'tis the subtle charm That makes so sweet the softness of smooth arm And adds a magic to each swift night-hour. It is the moon that lights the mystic bower Of passion,—and the stars between the trees,— And the strange glamour of the blue-haired seas; It is that weirdly perfumed lurking flower. It is the joy within the joy,—the sense Of curious ecstasy beyond control,— The unholy holy strength within the soul; It is the vial of marvellous wine from whence The red soft lingering honied round drops roll That fill the human veins with fires intense. SONNET IX II LOVE The sense of right in love is the one thing Within it sweetest and of deathless might: Its self-denial gives it larger light Than light of summer, or than light of spring. The sense of duty plumes love's eagle wing For loftier trackless leagues of sunlit flight: The sense of duty is the golden ring Whereby love weds the morn, and baulks the night. Ah! passion's eyes are dark: but love's are grey,— Clear-grey, like greyness of the English seas. One lives within the noon-tide and the day: The other 'mid the darkling olive-trees. Both are most sweet: yet each in her own way;— And when one comes, the other sister flees. SONNET X THE LONELY SENTINEL The sense of passion,—though the passion grew Not on the licensed legal common tree,— Made sudden Spring on every side of me Flute with a music half divine and new. It made the grey waves flash with sudden blue: It filled the air with speechless ecstasy; With golden gleams it lit the cloud-swept lea; It tinged the world's white flowers with roseate hue. And why?—I know not. Only God can tell Why things that on one side seem pale and wrong Are flushed and holy and sweet and full of song Upon the other: why in depths of hell Wherein black Satan's armoured hosts wax strong Glitters one lonely seraph-sentinel. SONNET XI A LOVER TO HIS MISTRESS Yes: every manner of creature you caress! That yellow wanton evil-tongued canary,— You hold the fluffy bird with laughter airy Within your blue-silk amorous loosened dress. You love your lover,—I could swear it,—less Than that red squirrel! Wild coquettish fairy, Of gifts to eager man so shy and chary,— Yet all creation you would bend to bless. With the dark tresses of that horse's mane You mix your own: you kiss his shining neck: You murmur pet names without end to him. If I would kiss you, lo! you start and check My passion with cold words: then turn again To that canary on his saucer's rim. SONNET XII THE ANCIENT MOON O moon, thou gazest on our London night! Thou see'st the Thames' dark eddies roll along: Thou hear'st coarse vulgar words, or snatch of song: Jealous, thou battlest with the electric light. Thou kissest thine old love, the obelisk white Whom thou didst toy with in the unknown years. Thou markest many a bridge with stately piers: Thou followest steam-boats in their throbbing flight. Yet how thou sneerest at us in thine heart,— Thou, most aristocratic of all things!— Thou who hast seen the Assyrian priestess stand Where pillars pale abut on endless sand: Thou who hast watched Gomorrha's black-haired kings, And lent thy lustre to barbaric Art. SONNET XIII TWO NIGHTS The same blue overhanging vault of sky And the same stars, and the same breeze that leaps Along the heavens,—and the same moon that sweeps, Majestic, through the hedgeless fields on high, Scanning creation with cold ageless eye. But what a change in two nights—lo! the lone And solemn desert, and a town half-shown Under the moon,—and the warm night-wind's sigh; White columns, and the brow-bound blue-black hair Of the Assyrian harlot and her face Hard and clear-cut within the market-place (And that same changeless golden moon still there!):— Another night: our Strand and all its glare, And gay-gowned wantons of another race. SONNET XIV BETHLEHEM AND THE GREEN PARK The barley-fields of Bethlehem,—the sky Full of far depths of colour strange and sweet; Boaz asleep,—and Ruth beside his feet Dreaming—the feathery swift moths fleeting by. Through his light sleep he hears a woman sigh And wakes and finds her, and their spirits meet:— Around them still that hush of Eastern heat, And the broad yellow sunburnt plains and dry. Another night:—the centuries have fled, Fled fast: in London, underneath a tree In the Green Park a soldier sits, and he Circles his sweetheart with strong arm, till lo! From the white barrack doth the bugle blow. Love lives, though Ruth the Moabite is dead. SONNET XV “IF ONE COULD LIVE FOR EVER!” If one could live for ever!—carrying on The life of old Assyria till to-day! See era after era pass away Yet be oneself,—though all men else had gone. The sun to-day is the same sun that shone On Saul and David: why should man, I pray, Be less long-lived than its fierce golden spray? E'en the moon lives, though age has made her wan. O God, to live for ever!—passing through Each age, and knowing the ecstasy of each: The same gaze that to-day, quite youthful, falls On the dim dome and facade of St. Paul's Having beheld the Pyramids quite new And flashed response to Cleopatra's speech. SONNET XVI THIS CENTURY,—AND THE NEXT This century knew Napoleon,—and it knew Byron and Wordsworth, and its heart has heard The vast French poet's century-equal word; And it has seen the smoke of Waterloo. It has seen France and Germany bestrew The summer plains with dead. It marked the Third Napoleon drop from empire. It has stirred With iron keels the sea's untroubled blue. Now, nearing its august and solemn close, It has seen Maytime Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke were assassinated in the Phœnix Park, Dublin, on Saturday, May 6, 1882. in the Phœnix Park Shudder at a crime than which no crime more dark Has ever stained May's hawthorn or May's rose. It has seen Revolution's first red spark: Will its child see the towering flame?—God knows. SONNET XVII LOVE THAT ENDURES Ye poets, think ye that the world will still Cherish your memory when ye come to die? Yes, for a little time,—with tear and sigh Bending above you: for an hour she will. Then will new song the woods and valleys fill And new sunrises flush the fickle sky! Again will passion's golden moments fly, As shadows race along the wind-swept hill. Will even the greatest live?—Yes, for awhile. But ah! the world has endless youth in store And unborn Shakespeares, Dantes, wait to pour Song at her feet, and win her fairy smile. Yet, Love that nought could conquer nor defile Has its own godhead, safe for evermore. ODE TO DEATH When all the pleasant days of love are past; When in life's autumn garden lo! the last Red wind-swept rose doth blow; When death stands in the austere gateway saying,— While round him strains of music weird are playing,— “Thou shalt no further go;” Oh, what shall then the former days be worth, And all the gladness of the green old earth, And all her white may-trees? Will all be new and strange in regions far Beyond the fire-gleam of the faintest star That rides the heavenly seas? When in the city of solemn death we stand, Lip touching pale lip, pale hand touching hand, What shall be waiting there?— Shall we meet poets true who went before, Whom we saw landing on the fatal shore? Shall conquering love shine fair? Shall we find all the flowers that fill the land Of sweet death waiting for our outstretched hand,— Or find no flowers at all? O spirits who have passed us, where are ye? We left you on the margin of the sea, Where blue waves rise and fall: We left you there upon the golden sand, And turned one moment, just to gaze inland And smell the hayfields' bloom. When we looked back from cliff-tops to the sea The waves were there (but grey), and where were ye? Gone, through the deepening gloom. And then against the last gold sunset-bar We marked a white sail outlined, faint and far, Upon the horizon dim. Slowly we turned,—and up the valley-glade We walked alone, alone, through beeches' shade, With tightened lips and grim. And we have never heard one word as yet, Though we have watched so many a gold sun set Upon that ocean-marge: O'er the wide channel comes the silvery laughter Of winds and waters,—but no word flies after! The distances are large. 1882. “TOO SOON!” One moment! then you passed away And all the sapphire sky turned grey In June. Why wait not, when 'tis close of day So soon? I caught a glimpse of laughing eyes, Bright-coloured like the laughing skies Of June. They passed. Why is it summer dies So soon? Farewell, clear eyes that flashed and gleamed Then left me lonely, having dreamed Too soon. When you had passed, no more it seemed Like June! LOVE AND TIME No true love passes.—Does the night Steal all its glory from the day? When once the sun is put to flight, Are all the heavens for ever grey? Nay! through the heights and depths of space The fiery-prowed wild star-ships race, The Armadas of immensity: The waves gleamed blue beneath the sun, But, now the golden day is done, The silver moon may kiss the sea. There is no end to time or space. New suns beyond our sun will rise: Life cannot alter true love's face, Nor dim the glory in love's eyes. Love is eternal, ever-new: Just as the waves each morn are blue; Just as the skies each morn are fair; Just as each autumn's golden sheaves Shine out afresh, and golden leaves Glitter each autumn through the air. But all else passes. Thrones must pass; The lordliest shrines and temples fall: Death's sickle gathers in the grass; No loiterer can escape his call. The gods whom man has made and crowned Lie pale, dismembered, on the ground: Man bade them reign; Time bids them flee;— Where once were prisons, now is corn; Where blossoms smiled, are wastes forlorn; Where rivers rippled, roars the sea. The Roman Caesars had their hour: The Roman legions poured along, Beheld the English woods a-flower, And heard the English billows' song. Where are they now? The waves that saw Their legions land with little awe Watch iron-armoured fleets to-day: The waves reck little for they know That nations, like the whirling snow, Melt into nought, and pass away. The Gallic Caesar's empire rose; The whole world trembled at his tread: He gave the thunder no repose; At his sole word the streams ran red. He changed his sceptre for a sword; He longed to say, “I am the lord Of every land beneath the sun. There were two Rulers—God and I; We threw with dice for sovereignty; Jehovah lost: Napoleon won!” Yet in the lonely sea-beat isle The second Caesar passed away, And once again the world might smile, And once again keep holiday. The corn was red at Waterloo, But there to-day the sky is blue: Two spectres pass. The flowers have heard One whisper, “I am Wellington!” And one, “I am Napoleon!” Their soldiers rise not at their word. Time watched pale Cleopatra's kiss Thrill Antony with sweet despair: Time heard the small smooth aspick hiss; Time saw the towers of Ilium flare. In pre-historic dateless hours Among great white unnamed strange flowers Time saw the kiss of bird and bird: When dying Jesus raised his eyes Fast-darkening to the lurid skies Time caught his last heart-broken word. Time saw the first fair woman's eyes Glitter with love when life was young; When young stars watched from cloudless skies, And ruby-throated songsters sung. Time saw the first kiss, and the last Will see when passion's moods are past And blind oblivion waits for man— Time, who beheld the pencil seized By God's swift hand when he well-pleased Sketched out our planet's primal plan. The fair white city on the Seine That heard the chief of poets sing,— That watched the triumph and the pain Of Hugo, and that crowned him king,— That, at the last wild century's close, Watched Revolution as it rose Sea-like with blood-besprinkled surge,— That saw the untrembling guillotine Cleave through the white neck of a queen. And heard the tocsin's cruel dirge,— This city too, shall change and pass; Of all things earthly nought abides: Be walls of iron or beaten brass Yet Time surmounts them and derides. One day the glory of the Czar Was glory as of sun or star, A splendour measureless, sublime: The next day at his feet the shell Burst madly, and the White Czar fell, 'Mid laughter from the lips of Time! But love abides, though all things change, Though nations plunge into the night; Though all around wax dim and strange; Though aging stars give little light.— We float along our century's stream, We sing and toil, and love and dream, But lo! we near the ocean's marge: Our river-century soon will end And, swelling into waves, descend Into the sea-waves fierce and large. Then what shall last? What thing shall be? What shall the twentieth century bear? What ships shall sail upon its sea? What new stars sparkle through its air? We know not: only this we know,— That love, though wild years come and go, Will wander calm-eyed, gathering flowers;— A thousand centuries are as one Day to the never-dying sun And unto love a few short hours. A LOVING HEART A heart that makes the best of things, That findeth good in all: A heart that through the summer sings, And when the cold snows fall: A heart that feels for others' pain And makes the weary young again: This is the heart that helps mankind, That cheers us on our way, And so itself shall surely find More joy than words can say. For what we give to lighten pain In gladness we receive again. The day is long and dark the night, Stern foes around us stand, And ripening years have dimmed the light That gleamed from fairy land: But never can that light depart Which flashes from a loving heart. November 2, 1887. “YONDER A CLOUD!” Yonder a cloud in the deep blue sky, Ever so small a cloud! 'Twill gather to thunder by and bye And the storm will speak aloud. Ever so small a cloud—pure white On the blue sky's spotless space: 'Twill thicken to lurid black by night And darken the sky's whole face. Yonder a cloud, between heart and heart, Ever so small a cloud: Yet gloom will gather, and light depart, And souls will be bent and bowed. Yonder a cloud! Be it ever so small, Let the breeze of love awake And hasten it forth, or hopes will fall And sorrowful hearts will break. Smile and be glad ere the great winds roar And the great seas madden and rise, Ere the fierce waves whiten the whole long shore And the black clouds darken the skies. Yonder a cloud! Be it ever so small, Take warning—cease to be proud: For world-wide grief, or an empire's fall, Begins with “yonder a cloud!” “IF I WERE AS OLD AS YOU!” “If only I were as old as you,” So said a child to me, A child with eyes of fearless blue Bright as the morning sea. “If only I were as old as you, With a great big beard and a hat”— “Yes, my darling, what would you do?” “I'd buy an owl and a cat!” “I'd buy an owl and a cat,” he said, “And a string of amber beads, And a soldier's suit of splendid red, And do tremendous deeds. I'd buy a ship, and a new toy-gun, If I were as old as you, And a helmet flashing like the sun, With a plume of lovely blue!” Such simple things! In later days Does anything bring the joy That a ship and a gun, or a cracker's blaze, Brings to an eager boy? Whatever I buy, I hear that cry, “If I were as old as you, I'd soon have a helmet like the sun, With a plume of lovely blue!” CROSS-PURPOSES “I would have given you love,” said I, “Flowers of the earth and stars of the sky: Thoughts like stars, and love like a flower, Blossoms fit for a queen's own dower, Gifts that a king might long to see”— “Buy me this diamond brooch,” said she. “Dreaming still of the earth?” said I. “You—why I thought you came from the sky! Thought you a fairy, deemed you a queen; Earth for your footstep seemed too mean. You to ask for a brooch from me—” “Buy me that necklace then,” said she. Star-dreams flash through the poet's head: Woman looks at the shops instead. The lover dreams in his lady's eyes; But the lady does not dream—she buys. “Brighter than stars are your eyes,” thinks he— “Eighteen and threepence, dear,” says she. POST-MORTEM SURPRISES I If there be any life beyond the tomb, How full of strange surprises must it be For those who, struggling upward from death's gloom, Behold new sunlight gild new shores and sea! Amidst the gladness will not sadness lurk? We are so wedded here to our own view, To our own dreams,—Jew, Christian, heathen, Turk— It will be hard to find that nought we knew. The Christian dying, and cursing as he dies The poet who believed that love was fair— It will be hard, beneath heaven's golden skies, To see his Jesus kiss a woman's hair. It will be very hard (our minds are small) For those who worshipped at the Virgin's feet To know she had a husband after all, And found the joys of marriage pure and sweet. And for the man of science strong and proud, Who peered beneath the billows of the sea, And pierced beyond the walls of mist and cloud, And read the past, and read futurity: The man before whose ardent gaze unveiled Creation shone,—who named them one by one, The stars that through the black night slowly sailed,— Who faced the soulless Force that steers the sun: The man who would permit mankind to sink, Sad soul by soul, unpitied, to its doom, And stand upon the abyss, close by the brink, And gaze with steady eyes far through the gloom: The man whose sombre wish it is to be Alone for ever, with no God to speak; Alone with darkness on the godless sea, Alone with sunrise on the mountain-peak; Alone with love's high rapture, which for him Would be discounted if a God were there (The sculptor's presence makes each stately limb Of woman to the thinker seem less fair): The man whose soul, though pride within it lies, Hath something of the greatness none the less Of the vast God whose being he denies, Tempered by man's eternal littleness: The man who, rather than bow down before The paltry God the Churches' hands have made, Finds God within the sunlight on the shore Or in the silent forest's moonlit shade: It will be somewhat hard for him to know That this world was not all! His one despair Will be to find that God is living, though God left no track upon the starlit air. It will be hard for Pharisees to own That there is sweetness in a harlot's eyes: It will be hard for kings to leave a throne, And own that flatterers' words were mostly lies. It will be strange to Christian eyes to see Their Lord and Master in a lower place, Perhaps, than thousands worshipped less than he; To mark some weakness in his soul and face. All will be wild surprise,—all must be new. Yet shall we find, if heavenly life be given, The most unselfish head was wisest too,— The heart that loved the most knew most of heaven. II For by our deeds, and by our deeds alone, God judges us,—if righteous God there be. Creeds are as thistle-down wind-tost and blown, But deeds abide throughout eternity. It matters little, so that love be there, Whether you think that legends have their day Then pass, with all they held of foul or fair, Or whether still, Church-pent, you praise and pray. It matters little whether you discern In Venus' limbs a sweetness past man's speech,— Heaven in the rose, a glory in the fern, A million jewels on the sunlit beach; Or whether you elect to burn and pant For heavenly splendours glittering past the tomb, Heedless that God, withholding these, would grant Your eyes a sight of leagues of furze in bloom. Whether you hold that Christ revealed to man The sweetness of the land beyond the grave, Or that Keats felt as never mortal can The sweetness of the earth he came to save: Whether you deem that Musset felt the whole Of young love's rapture as none else can feel, Or that the wild bright ocean's very soul Was Byron's, past all question or appeal: Whether you worship Shakespeare as God's son And Hugo as God's son, in very deed, Or in the older manner worship one, One God-man only, and nought else concede: Whether you hold that Dante brought to light For man pure love, as pure love is to be, And pierced the darkness of hell's lampless night Retaining still song's tongue, and eyes to see: Whether you hold that Turner once revealed, Revealed for ever, perfect landscape-art; That through the song of Shelley music pealed, Pure as from pure depths of God's very heart: All matters little.—Worship God in Christ, Or in the blossoms, or within the sun; Be heathen, Christian—but be not enticed By any creed to leave true work undone. One man will love the pleasures of the earth, Another long for pleasures in the sky; One finds his music in a young girl's mirth, And on her lips his immortality: Another deems that human love is vain, That only in Christ God's likeness must be sought; Another toils through a long life to gain A scholar's insight into ancient thought: Nought matters save our deeds.—If right we do, God is with us, Jehovah is our friend: If self we worship, though our creed be true We shall be found without God at the end. GOD'S SERMON I “Art not thou contented, mortal?” Sometimes so God seems to say: “Must I bear thee through death's portal? Wouldst thou live beyond thy day? Why shouldst thou aspire to be Sentient through eternity? “Life and tender love I sent thee, Sunny dawns and silent eves; Stars and moon and sun I lent thee, Ruby flowers and emerald leaves; Splendour of the sapphire main: Yet thou cravest to live again! “Foolish art thou, foolish surely, Clamouring for a joyless boon. If the heaven that shines so purely Now with golden stars and moon Shone for ever thus the same, Nought it would be but a name. “Thou in time wouldst grow quite weary Of the sights that seem so fair; Even the sunlight would be dreary, Sweet lips not what once they were; Much have I the power to give, Not the power to bid thee live. “Thou art part of all that changes, I myself am changeful too: Through new spheres my being ranges; Other work I have to do Than to keep a moth like thee Plumaged through eternity. “Life I gave thee for a season, Friendship's pleasure, passion's kiss; Heart to love, and brain to reason, Many a month of sunny bliss; But my last gift is my best— Peace from living, perfect rest.” II “Once thou see'st the sun, once only,— Nothing twice is quite the same: Life's supremest joys are lonely, Like the God from whom they came. Only once a kiss is sweet; Once as one the wild hearts beat. “If in heaven thou took'st thy pleasure Through a course of endless hours, Thinkest thou that thou wouldst treasure As thou dost the wayside flowers? No: its coming death bestows All its lustre on the rose. “Deepliest sinks the first impression: Even the form thou lovest best Passed into thy full possession On the night it was possest. Woman, blossom, sunset, sea, Give their beauty once to thee. “Craving heaven, thou cravest sadness. I myself would sometimes give All I know of heavenly gladness For the simple right to live On thine earth for fifty years, Sharing human joys and tears. “Woman's beauty I, her Maker, Only in a measure see: But thou art the full partaker, Her whole self she gives to thee. I, who first created this, Half am envious of her kiss. “Though his joy but for one minute Lasteth, yet the mortal gains, For there's more of rapture in it Than eternity contains! Take thy moment's bliss—then die Happier after all than I.” FATE'S EQUAL MEASURE We need not envy fern and daisy, Nor summer's wealth of bloom: October's days come, dark and hazy, And clothed about with gloom. We need not envy summer's roses: The bleak autumnal wind Sweeps through the frightened shuddering closes And leaves no flowers behind. No lives we see are worth our longing: Through every golden dream The pallid morning thoughts come thronging In one long ghostly stream. Some seem to win one happy season: But envy not their fate! Sorrow and blank dismay and treason Upon their threshold wait. Are lovers happy? Not for ever The clinging kiss shall last. A thousand foemen wait to sever: One rapture—then 'tis past! The blue sea turns to storm and madness; The still lake boils with foam: Spent is the green-leafed summer's gladness; Afar the red leaves roam! So envy no man.—Happiest lovers Have death beside their feet. Lo! what a strange flower-raiment covers The supple snake's retreat. At least in this an equal measure Fate's grim unbribed hand deals, Bestowing pain, and stealing pleasure From every heart that feels. DESPAIR I Each flower hath fellow-flowers, and every leaf May share its grief: The golden great stars roll in ordered course And blend their force: But on his solitary piteous throne Man sits alone. 2 The skies have not one tender word to say, Black, red or grey: The wavelets laugh; their laugh is not for him: The forests grim Wake in the morning by the fresh wind blown; Man stands alone. 3 He hath no share in soulless Nature's glee, Not in the sea, Nor in the life of plant nor joy of morn Nor breeze-bowed corn: Not in the life of flowers when these resume Their last year's bloom. 4 Man lives alone beneath heaven's burning cope, Devoid of hope; Meeting by night and day, and everywhere, Gaunt-browed despair, And knowing only that time must efface Him and his race. June 9, 1881. PAST MANY YEARS Past many years I gaze towards one sweet face And towards a wind-swept sea-kissed upland place Where love was bright: And round me still the far-off wonder flows As the red sunset o'er the water throws Its magic light. Ah! sweet, was all the long strange road too long And couldst thou find no solace in my song Nor sense of rest? Were the wild blossoms that earth's pilgrims seek Poor by the flowers that nestle in thy cheek And in thy breast? And had the lonely unattractive way No splendour greater than of gold sun-ray Or silver moon? Are there not stars and moons and suns within The souls who struggle God's high goals to win, For crown and boon? Ah! weary lovely far-off woman-face How far thou art from love's supreme embrace, How far from mine! Thou lingerest in the green vales far inland And the grey sea's waves win from thy white hand No loving sign. Between us lies a strange and bitter past. Wilt thou traverse the rocky road at last And win the beach? Wilt thou discern that where the great seas roar Delight unspoken dwells for evermore And love's own speech? Oh, in the future's stirring sacred name Thy soul for parcel of her force we claim,— We claim thy power. Remember that the fairest roses shine Where storm and sun and cloud and light combine To brace each flower. Death lies between us; and a weary way. But, by the loving lips of this salt spray And by this place And by all memories, if thine eyes I met, It would be just as if no parting yet Had dimmed love's face! June 10, 1881. “THE SAME FLOWERS BUD, THE SAME FLOWERS BLOW” O old-world singers, ye are dead, But still the eternal rose is red: The same flowers bud, the same flowers blow That once ye loved, so long ago! Where are ye, Greeks who sang at morn Ere new-world sorrow of heart was born? The same flowers bud, the same flowers blow That once ye loved, so long ago! Where are ye who in the early days Being sweet made sweeter English ways? The same flowers bud, the same flowers blow That once ye loved, so long ago! Oh, where are Iseult's ardent eyes Coloured blue-grey like Irish skies? The same flowers bud, the same flowers blow That once they loved, so long ago! Where is the mouth that sang to sleep The blue clear charmed Italian deep? The same shores laugh, the same waves glow That Shelley loved so long ago! Where is the heart that mountain-height Uplifted, and the hill-streams white? The same hills smile, the same streams flow That Wordsworth loved so long ago! Poets and lovers, all are gone, But still the sad same world blooms on: The same flowers bud, the same flowers blow That all these loved so long ago! Thou too hast vanished, lady fair: Thy wreath is dust; thy crown is air: But still the mocking lilies blow That once we loved, so long ago! July 1, 1881. “WHEN ALL THE TOIL IS ENDED” When all the toil is ended, I will leave This dreary land for ever,—I will go Beyond the regions where the wet winds grieve To lands of golden morn and crimson eve, Beyond the snow! To regions where the summer roses blow Safe from our darkling weather's changeful stain And where with silvery voice the clear streams flow And through the moonlit night the lilies grow, Beyond all pain, I'll pass; and through the sunlit days I'll gain Health, and the happier sense of lovelier things Than those that under the fog's dreary reign Struggle: I'll rest where in some leafy lane The throstle sings. Paris shall close me round with sun-bright wings And soothe me with soft laughter, and her eyes Full of all glory woman's love-glance brings Shall waken old lost joys of far-off springs And far-off skies. And Italy shall on my vision rise And deathless Rome; yea, blue Italian seas O'er which the Southern light-winged zephyr flies, Waters o'er which the gondola swift hies, Mountains and trees: And then to Paris and her joyous breeze I will return, for all my heart is there; An exile from her streets and sunny leas I pine in these thick streets and fields that freeze For her sweet air. Paris, O Paris, thou to me wast fair When as a boy I wandered through thy ways! Now that the grey is mixing with my hair I would once more be calm and happy where I knew bright days. 1882. MAN AND THE DEMIURGUS “Have I not hosts of stars beyond thy measure?” God said: “Are suns on suns not heaped like golden treasure That I may plunge glad hands in at my pleasure When thou art dead? “Am I not, past the ages' dread and wonder, Content? Have I no lightning-steeds whose neighing is thunder, By whose eye-flash the heights are cloven in sunder And smitten and rent? “Have I not love beyond thy computation, Beyond The fairest dreams of man or tribe or nation? Can I through whose frame throbs the world-sensation, Can I despond? “Is not my power through world on world extending, Where light-beams dart? Art thou not fearful, frail worm, of offending?” “One thing thou hast not,” Man replied unbending: “My heart.” 1885. “IT WERE BETTER FOR HIM—” Better be fathoms underneath the deep Where sea-weeds wash and strange sea-creatures creep, Thy neck enringed with stone, Than change the eyes and soft lips of one child Into the hardened eyes and mouth defiled That haunt the streets, alone. 1885. A MODERN PREACHER I In church, a few, A pale-eyed crew; Around, the darkness of a starless sea, And one who guides Through blind deaf tides That surge and leap to windward and to lee. II Just gathered here In hope, in fear, In doubt, in wonder, a strange wandering band, In this ark-church Whose tossed planks lurch From side to side, these people kneel and stand. III “What hope,” they say, “For us to-day? The old God is dead. What new God canst thou bring O preacher pale? Lo! our ship's sail Shrieks, as the wild wind-scourges lash and sting. IV “Preach. We will hear With eager ear And wrought-up passionate heart what thou canst tell. Is there a God? Why must man plod Through miles of earth that might be miles of hell? V “The lights within This church, where din And turmoil just for one sweet moment cease, Are glad and bright. But what wild night Outside! What hope for man of lasting peace! VI “Preach, preach. We love Thy face, above The old pulpit, full of noble thought and high. But when we leave The church this eve, How wails the wind across black starless sky! VII “Steer the ship well, Past shoals of hell, Past white fierce waters, past the cliffs that ring With clash of tides: The wind derides Our hearts and voices even while we sing. VIII “Yet preach thou, friend. All hath an end: Thy hope, our doubt, the wild world's storm-tossed way. Steer straight thy church In noble search Through lampless midnight for the golden day.” 1885. “A YEAR AGO” A year ago we stood beneath these temple pillars white And watched the star-ships slowly sail across the purple night. He asked me “Did I love him?” Oh, the answer that I gave! A woman loves but once on earth, but once beyond the grave. A year ago! a year ago! He has forgotten quite: But I remember every word of love we spoke that night. A year ago! a year ago! A little while it seems; And yet 'tis long enough to prove that woman's hopes are dreams. I stand again to-night beside the blue Ægean wave: Again the stars shine out—they seem to shine above my grave. For oh, a woman loves but once! When once her soul is given She cannot love again on earth, she cannot love in heaven. To-night perhaps 'neath other stars, beside another sea, He breathes into another's ear the words he spake to me. The cold stars sail across the sky, the cold blue ripples break: I loved the stars and wavelets once,—but only for his sake. O love, my tenderest hopes were dreams, and now the dreams depart: You gave me passion for an hour, but I gave you my heart. 1887. THE TWO PROPHETS I Bold was the man who ventured to declare “There is no death!”—when every day which fled Murmured, “I carry with me hosts of dead And pour their souls forth on the soulless air:” When every sunrise whispered of despair, Saying, “Ere to-night thou also mayest be led Along the path thy parents had to tread, Who heard no voice, nor saw the sunlight there.” Bold was the man who ventured in the face Of the clear certainty that all things die To announce an endless life beyond death's gloom: To cry, “There is a God of love and grace; There is for each an immortality; There is a power that can unseal the tomb.” II But bolder is the spirit who at this hour After so many centuries would revive Despair, to man proclaiming “Thou shalt live For this life only, like the grass or flower. Hope, young imagination's fairy dower, Has passed away for ever! Toil and strive And love. But one reward the fates can give: Silence. The rest lies far beyond their power.” Bold is the spirit who at this century's close Proclaims: “The star that lighted mankind once Now trembling towards the godless dark is driven! Save in man's dreams your Master never rose; The time has come for ever to renounce All faith in God, and every hope of heaven.” 1888. TWO SONNETS I MERCY AND JUSTICE “Mercy, good Lord,” the sea-beach preachers pray: “Mercy for sinful man; for he deserves His doom, and thy great justice never swerves,— Mercy for man in thy grim judgment-day!” So they exclaim,—beside the sea-waves grey O'er which that unconverted sea-gull curves. And some with craven hearts and cowardly nerves Bend to the lurid God their words portray. But I—I stand secluded and apart, And mix my spirit with the sea's great heart, And with the voice, as it were, of all the sea I cry: “Not mercy,—justice, we require; Be thou true-souled, O God,—and be no liar; Lo! that much sorrowing man demands from thee.” September 6, 1882. II THE GREAT CHANGE Of old the singers spake of loving ways Of God towards man, of wondrous mercies shown: God was the Giver of all things—man alone Received, and homage of high love and praise Was due to God,—altars mankind must raise; With gladness shout or for transgressions moan.— But now crime's torrent gushes from God's throne! God seems to us the sinner in these days. Of old, it seemed, the heavenly eye pursued Sinners who fled from it beyond the light, Cowered in the darkness, trembled at the sun. Now man demands of God: “But art thou good? Hast thou, Lord God, in every point done right? Hast thou loved justice? Yea, what hast thou done?” 1888. THE HOLIER SEPULCHRE The Christian Church that stole the body of Christ In ages past, when Christian years began; That, shameless, robbed the human race, and priced The priceless flesh and blood poured out for man; The Christian Church that with huge priestly scorn Closed up man's saviour in its vaults of night, Stealing the struggling sunshine from the morn, In God's name battling with the God of light; The Christian Church that with base second stroke Drove its proud spear-point through man's saviour's side, Bade man adore no Jesus, but invoke The Christ it robed in wealth and crowned with pride; This Church to-day hears ringing in its ears Time's stern strong judgment-sentence, “Thou hast sinned, And lo! thy legend of unnumbered years Shall pass, like dreams that leave no trace behind.” Yea, now man's voice more mighty than the wave Speaks, half with pity, half in deathless scorn: Man lifts man's saviour from his second grave, Lifts from his brow his second crown of thorn. Nobler than structures raised by Christian Art Is Jesus' resting-place, his timeless tomb: Christ's newer sepulchre is mankind's heart— No starless charnel-house of poisonous gloom. “NOUGHT PERISHES” Nought perishes. All love-dreams of the past Transfigured, through all future years shall last. June 1, 1886. LYRICS TOGETHER They were young and glad together In the dawn of life's first May, When in bright and sunny weather Sang the birds from every spray. Clear the heaven shone out above them; Blue and radiant were the skies: All things living seemed to love them, And the Spring gleamed in her eyes. Through life's Summer still together, Hand in hand and heart to heart, They have borne the sultry weather And have watched the days depart. Still she is to him the maiden Who stepped daintily of old Through the grass, her apron laden With bright buttercups of gold. Still together, still together, They will face life's autumn hours: In the grim November weather Love will strew their path with flowers. For their love has ever brightened Since the first long loving day, And their happiness has heightened, Though their hair is growing grey. HEAVENLY WHISPERS Hardly one sad soul is friendless; Somewhere glows a kindred heart; Yes, though dreary days seem endless, Though sad springs on springs depart. If the rich man in his garden Breathes the incense of the rose, For the poor man at his window White and pure the snowdrop blows. Aye, if every friend be taken, If our silent hearth be lone, Yet are we not all forsaken, Dearer far the dead have grown. Is there one sad soul who hears not From the land beyond the grave Loving voices, gentle whispers, As of souls who yearn to save? And if even these we hear not, If the depth of heaven be gloom, If the angel-voices cheer not, Sound not from beyond the tomb, Still no soul is friendless wholly; Each one who the earth hath trod Hath one Friend, one Friend undying,— Every soul is dear to God. THE HIGHER BEAUTY Let the poet worship beauty, Let him dream within the eyes Of his loved one full of sunlight, Sweeter than the sunniest skies: Let him find in woman's glances Theme for passion and for praise: Let them fill with wild romances All the dreams of all his days. But a nobler thing than beauty And a worthier gift by far Is the love that crowns each duty With the crown of sun or star. Lovely even on earth is woman: She's an angel from the skies When she bends to help the helpless, With God's pity in her eyes. Poets, lovers, ye who worship Beauty's every curve and line, Worship even more devoutly Woman's tenderness divine. Sculptors, painters, ye who build her Temples in the realm of Art, Praise beyond a woman's beauty Woman's ever-loving heart. “MY QUEEN AND I” We walked the woods, my queen and I; The air was bright with spring: Warm was the sun, and blue the sky, And clear the lark did sing. “O love, will you be ever true?” “Aye, true till death!” she said; “True, till the sun forsakes the sky, Till every star is dead.” She spoke, and looked up with a sigh: And then we smiled, my queen and I! To-day we walked through waving corn; Our path lay through the gold: It was a perfect August morn, Sweet as that morn of old. We strolled along, my wife and I: “How short life seems,” she said; “How sad to think that love must die, As spring-flowers all are dead.” I heard, and looked down with a sigh: And then we smiled, my queen and I! And one day through life's autumn woods, With golden leaves around, Beneath grey sky my love and I Shall wander, calm and crowned: Crowned, not with summer dreams that melt When sets the summer sun, But with a sweetness only felt When wedded hearts grow one. Our looks will meet without a sigh When we grow old, my queen and I! “THINE EYES SHALL SEE THE KING!” Thine eyes shall see the King. When earth's wild wastes are trod, Thine eyes shall look on God: Winter shall cease, and change to heavenly spring— Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty, Thine eyes shall see the King! Him shall thine eyes behold. When sorrow's overpast Him shalt thou see at last, And tread with him the heavenly courts of gold— Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty, Thine eyes shall see the King! Thine eyes shall see the King. The Vision surely waits Beyond death's solemn gates, Awful with light that only death can bring: Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty, Thine eyes shall surely see the King. LIGHT IN DARKNESS Sufferer, though thy path be dark, Though no starlight thou mayest mark, Though the days bring deepening pain And love's old sweet hopes seem vain, Though thine eve belie thy morn, Though thy brows be pierced with thorn, Though thy path lie through the night, Christ thy Lord shall be thy Light! Youth, round whom the sunlight gleams, Passing through the vale of dreams, Faint the mountains seem and far, Flowers in myriads round thee are. Yet thou needest Christ to guard! Soon thy pathway may be barred By an host as yet concealed: Then thou needest Christ for Shield! Youth and age indeed are one: Each needs Christ for star and sun; Christ for shield, and crown, and sword; Christ's sweet welcome for reward. When the golden gateways shine, Then may Christ with voice divine Say to each, “Thou need'st not fear; We were waiting for thee here!” “LITTLE THINGS” Art thou powerless, friend, for much? Every heart can bless; Every loving look and touch Makes life's sorrow less. Psalms are in the ocean's swell, But the brooklet charms as well With its laughter light. Life and love pursue the sun, Yet what starry work is done In the purple night: Stars complete his task begun Through the purple night. Every little helps along, Cheers and lifts and speeds,— Note of wren and robin's song, Lisp of river-reeds. Not so much the queenly rose Gives the wearied heart repose As the daisy trim. Is the road the Master trod Over-hard for less than God? Thou canst gaze at him: Where he triumphed, thou canst plod Humbly after him. A FAIRY GARDEN Life was all a fairy garden When we walked in childhood's ways,— Starlit nights of happy dreaming, Sunshine through the golden days. But the moments passed, and left us Somewhat weary, every one; And each year of life bereft us Of some further gleam of sun. God had given us in our childhood A pure angel from his skies To watch over childish footsteps,— And his love beamed from her eyes. Ah! how many an angel-mother Here has tarried for awhile, Then has left us,—and no other Has the sweetness of her smile! But another angel finds us: God will leave us not alone. Somewhat of a mother's sweetness Soundeth in a younger tone. God, who knew our childhood's dangers, Knew the weariness of life, Sent the child the mother-angel,— Sends the man the angel-wife. LIFE'S PATH Life's path winds ever upward; 'Tis no use looking back: The flowers we love and long for Are further on the track. Not in the old green valleys Our haven can be found, But where the North wind sallies Across rough mountain ground. Then ho! for noble climbing. Life's work is not yet done: Our work will not be over Till the last peak is won. Yes, ho! for noble climbing, And effort pure and high. The green seductive valleys Fade out from heart and eye. The mountains, ho! the mountains— Our path lies over these; We quit the valley-fountains, We quit the flowers and trees. We struggle ever upward: Upon the mountain's crest, But never till we reach it, Our weary souls may rest. “HOME AT LAST!” Long years of grief and sighing! Wild seasons of unrest! Hope blooming,—straightway dying On Winter's frozen breast! Through storm and strife God steers us, Till storm and strife be past: This one thought ever cheers us— We shall win home at last! Home at last! God's dice are always loaded. Not fruitless is the pain Of one flower-bud corroded By harsh November's rain. God brings the singing season, And tunes the thrush's lute, In spite of Winter's treason Who gazes blank and mute, Blank and mute! Through all the storms God leads us, And leads the years that wane: The Love eternal heeds us, And changes grief to gain. Time lines and grooves our features; Pain wears our spirits fast: But God will bring his creatures All safely home at last, Home at last! FLOWERS SONNET Mixed with the savour of that central Rose That fills the temple of my heart with bloom Float other seemly odours; there is room For a soft lily tender as the snows, And by her side a red anemone blows, And a staunch wall-flower. Each of these I love: White, red, and yellow banners wave above The plot of quiet ground where each one grows. And over them there stands that crimson flower That, like a picture in a hollow frame, Thrills the recesses of my heart with flame, A very torrent of voluptuous power: Yet from those smaller blossoms in their hour Scents delicate and floods of colour came. December 1, 1871. FOREBODING SONNET Oh hold me fast, my darling, hold me fast! I hear the terrible approaching wings Of Time, like black-plumed pestilential things, Like dim black-throated swifts with bodies cast On the loose circles of an eddying blast: I hear the hoarse reproach his coming brings. Yea, he shall loosen that pale mouth that clings To mine,—our passion shall be floated past But as a red leaf on the autumnal wind. And, therefore, for the last time, hold me tight, And shine upon me with thine own sweet light Of eyes whose magic I was wont to find Even as summer, delicate and kind; Even as spring, immeasurably bright. December 15, 1871. CONFIDENCE SONNET I have written many sonnets of mistrust But now I brush misgiving from me, dear: My soul is confident, my brain is clear: I tread my doubts and misery to dust. I bid the east wind with a rapid gust Sweep timid apprehension far from here: I rest upon your faith without a fear: I slay my weakness with a final thrust. I know that thou art certainly as pure As any snowdrop, and as soft and white: That, even as the mountains do endure, So doth the calm inviolable might Of maidenhood and beauty, and that your Sweet eyes are as the stars' unshaken light. January 9, 1872. VIOLET-EYES SONNET Your eyes were grey before, but now they gleam Like violets set within an ivory frame: So soft and so ethereal a flame Doth play about them, that to me they seem As subtle and as shifting as a dream. Your lips are sweet as violets, and as red As roses: round about your fair soft head Hovers a silvery moon-forsaken beam. What miracles hath Love within his power, That these clear eyes, that were but sorry grey A short while since, now bloom like any flower, Unfolding a most lovely violet ray, Increasing in its warmth from hour to hour, And in its tenderness from day to day. January 9, 1872. “THE MOMENT CAME” The moment came, and I never knew it, The moment to die at the palace gate: And for ever and ever my soul will rue it That the message came, but came too late. O angels who guarded my life's gold portal Why did ye not speak one warning word Clear, straight, from immortals to one sad mortal Whose very soul would have leapt, had he heard? Why did ye not speak, while life was painless, My loved one safe in the sweet safe nest Now stained with the blood of the dove most stainless And robbed for ever of sleep and rest? June 11, 1900. NEVER MORE New foaming seas, New spring-tide breeze, New shells upon the shore, New leaves on trees,— But never never more Those blue waves, blue whatever winds might wail or roar. New loves with gold Locks like the old, New rose-mouth to adore, New hands to hold,— But never never more The woman's face which lighted all that laughing shore. The shore where fell Waves loved so well, Where cliffs their gold flowers bore, Whose tender tendrils swell This year,—but never more Shall crown the brown-haired head they crowned and bound of yore. FIVE SONNETS (1880) SONNET I THE FACES OF THE FUTURE Will there be any loving song as clear, As firm, as sure, as eager, as prolonged? As loud a lover for as sweet an ear? As many hymns of worship as have thronged My harp, through many a sorrow-burthened year? Would that my spirit but for one strange night Might pierce the future with keen vision bright— For but one hour the future's singing hear! Would that I might for but one moment see The faces of the future and the flowers Set on those distant shores in place of thee: Yea, plunge hot-handed 'mid the future's bowers, And join its unawakened revelry, And mark its streams, its towns, its golden towers! SONNET II SHOULD I NOT RETURN? Then should I not return, O love, to thee, Finding none other bride by no far stream; No voice that burns the soul with ecstasy, No living passion sweeter than a dream? Should I not, swiftly turning, shortly seem Upon our moonlit cliff-top to alight, Spreading broad spirit-pinions weird and white, That strangely in the moonrays, vaguely, gleam? Should I not laugh to think that I had dared To search the future, when that future, snared And captured, sweet within thine hands doth lie? Should I not smile, returning, at the thought That, foolish, I through future lands had sought To rid me of the inevitable sky? SONNET III THE CERTAIN SKY For thou dost brood as certain as the sky As sweet, as sure, above me; and thy glow From sacred morn till eventide dost throw About me, and within thine hands I lie When the still breath of eventide doth sigh: If through the future, winged and swift, I go, Thou art within that future, sweet—and lo! I fare no better, if death's door I try. For thou art there within that solemn gateway White, fair as ever, and the same—and straightway I feel upon my brow the pulse of wings; The rustle of the old same plumes sonorous, The sweet wings' same soft pure air-winnowing chorus; No change, but closer prison and glad, death brings. SONNET IV DEATH TRANSFORMED Yea, all the face of death, death's bosom, changes; I pass amid his broad imperious wings; The warrior black who all the black night ranges Is as a maid whose red mouth laughs and sings. About me his resistless arms he flings, But they are soft as woman's, and his face As woman's, and his breath about me clings As woman's—and the whole strange dimlit place Seems like a lawn, a gladsome grassy space: “So this is death,” I said, and as I spoke, Death's arms were bent my body to embrace, Round me they folded like a lissome cloak, And in the eyes of death so sweet a thing I saw revealed, it made my spirit sing. SONNET V DEATH'S TENDERNESS Yea, when death touched me tender was his breast As thy breast in the vision long ago; Within the billow of sleep I sank to rest: Tides crystal-clear above my head did flow. Absolute peace for almost utter woe Clothed all my spirit in harness like a flame: My head sank back, and, sinking backward, lo! The old immeasurable fragrance came, The scent of blossoms with no mortal name, And wrapt me in a regal incense-cloud, And seemed my very inmost soul to claim, Bearing it upward in a royal shroud Through skies, past stars, past suns, past moons and seas, Beyond the birthplace of the purest breeze. GOLDEN SHEAVES I Through spring and summer we toil and slave, We suffer and strive and dream; Our ships fly over the sun-bright wave, Far, far as the waters gleam. We struggle and wrestle for wealth and gold: Though many a hope deceives, Yet some men triumph as life grows old And gather their golden sheaves— Sheaves of silver and sheaves of gold, Glorious golden sheaves! II But what is the sheaf that ever abides, That never can fade or pass? That perishes not when Time derides The blossoms and sundried grass? Love is the beautiful golden sheaf That grows with the autumn leaves: Yes, all true lovers, when Time slays grief, Shall gather their golden sheaves— Beautiful golden sheaves of love, Beautiful golden sheaves! III When sheaves of silver and sheaves of gold Shall crumble and rust and die, Love's beautiful sheaf shall ne'er grow old,— It is garnered and stored on high. Faith delivers the heart from fear, And the righteous soul believes That all who have toiled in the cornfields here Shall gather their golden sheaves— Shall gather their golden sheaves in heaven, Infinite golden sheaves! “THE ENDING OF THE DAY” If at the ending of the day we meet The very lips of love, and find them sweet: When death draws near If then we hear The unknown song no mortal may repeat: If after all the loves of earth are cold Love tenderer then than poet ever told Around us flow, That we may know Fruition of the dream we dreamed of old: If at the setting of the mortal sun Sunrise eternal for us has begun: If we may reach The joys past speech Alone by agony past language won: If even the kiss of God that no man knows Descends, a fragrance stranger than the rose, On lips that seem Not in a dream To win what love conceals till love bestows: If this be so, then who shall dare to say That even a single pang were best away? If suffering lead To this indeed Then death is life and starless night is day. “A SOUL'S PURE RADIANCE” I A soul's pure radiance thrills Death's starrier air And shines around the path my loved one trod. Suffering she bore which few have had to bear: She rests to-night within the arms of God. II And I...God guide me through this torturing dream, Arm me with iron strength and purpose clear: That She may say, when comes my hour supreme, “I never left you. Husband, I am here.” “THE DEAD HAVE NOT DEPARTED” The dead have not departed, Their forms are very near: Rise up, thou broken-hearted, For there is nought to fear. She whom thou lovest dearly Is very close indeed. She sees thy sad soul clearly: Speak thou, for she will heed. 1886 and 1913. “CAN I FORGET?” Can I forget thee? Can the summer rose Forget the green-leafed glade in which it blows? Can it forget The shade the tender thicket round it throws? Can I forget The bower wherein my flowerlike passion grows? Can I forget thee? Can the morning dew Forget the green rich grass it glistened through? Can it forget The warm soft morning mists of pearly blue? Can I forget The hour when morning light was one with you? Can I forget thee now earth's story's told, Now that my lips have pressed thy lips grown cold? Can I forget Thee whom death struck, but whom death shall not hold? Can love forget The hair that shamed the sun with countless gold? Can I forget? Can heaven forget the sun? Or can night's robes without a star be spun? Can these forget Through whom their jewels and golden wealth are won? Can I forget Thee, mine in life, in death—and death is done. July 1, 1881 and January, 1913. SONGS OF ENGLAND AWAKING ENGLAND AWAKING “Germany must have a Navy of such strength that even for the strongest Naval Power, a war with her would involve such risks as to imperil its own supremacy.” —Preamble to the German Navy Act. “Grave responsibilities rest upon any one who misleads our countrymen by encouraging them to continue in their belief that an invasion of these shores is impossible....It is my absolute belief that, without a military organization more adequate to the certain perils of the future, our Empire will fall from us and our power will pass away.” —Lord Roberts, speaking in the House of Lords, on Monday, November 23, 1908. When the disconcerted Concert, with their instruments out of tune Broke and scattered and vanished, came William's concert soon. He grasped the hand of the Sultan, and his own from the grasp grew red: “Lend me your valorous army, when the right time comes,” he said. “Lend me your strong-thewed army, for I follow my god Bismarck And I send no Pomeranian to break his bones in the dark. If ever to throttle England becomes my brotherly work, I can throttle her best by the fingers of the woman-strangling Turk. “I will build a fleet gigantic, I will wait till the moment due, And when that hour approaches, friend, my hope is in you.” So the Sultan Abdul Hamid and William the Crafty clinked Red-stained glasses together, and each at the other winked. Then came Turkey's youngsters, and they carried a great reform, And they did it without bloodshed, but they roused in the West a storm. For “What's to become of my Army, if the Young Turks change in a night?” Wringing his hands, cried William: and he hated the dawning light. Then the Emperor Francis Joseph, and a pitiful thing was this, Joined in the new base Concert, the concert of snakes that hiss. For Herzegovina lured him, and the moral strife was brief: An Emperor lied with an Emperor, a thief hitched on to a thief. White-haired Francis Joseph!—Nay, not his was the fall. Give the trickster's honours to strategist Aerenthal. Bismarck, Metternich, taught him, and he learned his lesson well: And when they cabled, he knew not that they cabled straight from hell. Up with the Sultan's army! Down with the men who strive That a newer nobler Turkey may conquer and grow and thrive! Such was the Teuton's message, cynical, devilish, dark: Worthy of statesman Satan, worthy of fiend Bismarck. They were strong from warring with women,—like steel their muscles grew As the babes and the younglings whimpered, and the wives and mothers flew. What an ally was the Sultan! What a host to be led By Abdul in eagled helmet, or William in fez of red! So this Dual Alliance prospered, till the Young Turks rose in the night Loathing the blood-stained darkness, longing for dawn and light. Their hearts yearned out towards England, the land no Hamid has trod: But that was a stab for William, though he trusted in Bismarck's God. Bismarck's God would be for him. He would bend and would hear The Emperor apt at sermons, big with a godly fear. So he prayed to God and Bismarck: and their Dual answer came, Tongued like the flash of cannons, written in words of flame. “Look to our Navy, William. That is the thing to do. England is old and weary, and the world is sick of her too. England was always a braggart: but she took three years to beat A handful of Boers in their kopjes. William, strengthen the fleet.” So he hearkened to Bismarck pleading, and he never thought it odd That behind the cuirassed German stood a cloven-footed God. He knew not the God of England, for Christ smiles full in His gaze And He guides the sons of England, if England walks in His ways. Then to the West turned William, and his naval instincts grew: Wherever he turned that tattered old flag of Britain flew. “Pile up our naval programmes! On with the ships!” said he. “Soon we shall hustle England. Leave but the job to me.” So the Navy Bills kept passing, and the big preamble said “On the heels of earth's mightiest Navy we intend ere long to tread!” “The prize is vast,” thought William—“the love of the soul of the sea: The waves that fought for England may fight in the end for me.” Then at last the English hearkened, they awoke at last from sleep: They heard the taunts of the giant, and his gibes at last sank deep. Men and women wakened, and the soul of the sea once more Spake to the soul of the nation, and it listened as heretofore— “Be the cost what it may be, be the toil what it will, Let England rule the waters with a mastering Navy still. Long enough has the German vaunted, let him build till his shipyards quake, Let him strain till his sinews splinter—he will never overtake.” All the nation united, as a nation at last was heard; And our inner strifes were forgotten, and one was the loyal word. Let the German sweat and struggle till his blood-shot eyes grow dim: Not for him is the ocean, her passion is not for him. Our women were all divided: strange tastes and luxuries grew: But they heard the big preamble, and they understood and knew It was not a question of voting. Nay, they voted all alike. Every vote was a sword-stroke, though need was never to strike. The women whom Shakespeare drew for us, hearts of love and of flame, When the German big preamble and the German challenge came, Ceased to contend for trifles. What was the suffrage worth If nothing was left to vote for, with England wiped from the earth? So in the year one thousand nine hundred and nine, men saw With passion and deep emotion, with the old delight and awe, The soul of the sea brought closer, for ever face to face With the conquering Anglo-Saxon, the one sea-conquering race. For the Power that sways the ocean, can sway the lands as well: Can lift all earth to a heaven, or sink all earth to a hell. If the moustached German giant sways mankind, which will it be? Militant force on the mainland: flames of hell on the sea. Be not a moment in error: misjudge, mistake not at all. Britain rules for freedom—if the British Power should fall, If the Power that pocketed Alsace gets our Colonies well in his grip, Freedom means violation, a kiss with a fang in the lip. If compulsory service follows on the trumpet-call to the race Blown by our foremost soldiers, that is little indeed to face. Better compulsory service for the sake of the well-loved land Than a slave's compulsory service, and cuffs from a master's hand. Think not our enemies loiter: their chiefest end is in view. Englishmen, Englishwomen, the centuries waited for you. Yours is the word of the ages: for you the choice that will make England the arbiter ever, England alert and awake. Choose, for the moment presses. Choose, for the hour draws nigh. Keep the command of the ocean, live then—lose it, and die. Life and death are in balance: heaven and hell draw swords. But the casting-vote for ever will rest with the wild sea's lords. When the proud-sailed old Armada steered straight for the Cornish coast Our ships were manned by seamen, each strong man good as a host. But the wide-winged storm fought for us, the soul of the sea was aflame, And we know the word of destruction that forth on the storm-wind came. Again and again for England the soul of the sea has fought And far in advance for England lie triumphs beyond all thought: Triumphs of Art and Science, wonders that no man knows; Light in the streams of the sunshine, love in the heart of the rose. But we need the strong straight sword-arm, or Science will speak in vain; And love in the hearts of our women is nought but a grief or a pain If the virile guns can speak not, when the masterful moment comes, With the roar of unleashed lions, that chimes to the roll of the drums. In Africa God was with us, and a thousand blunders He Watched but to overrule them, for He loves the soul of the sea: And the soul of the sea prayed for us, and the sea's great Maker heard The sob in her passionate waters, the sea's strange glorious word. The sea's soul interceded, for the sea loved Nelson well: Time to learn was given us, and we passed through Africa's hell, And we bent to our work in earnest, and we won the game at last. But that was a mere school-lesson: Pretoria lies in the past. If the German moustached giant and his iron-drilled legions came, Think of the homes of England! Think of the leaping flame! Remember the blaze of Bazeilles. “What a city to sack!” Cried Blücher, of old-world London—but he had no ships at his back. If ever the English meadows and the English hillsides felt The foot of the German giant, and the giant's foul blow dealt, Never would horror greater have changed the land to a grave, For the soul of an English woman is not the soul of a slave. Therefore be wise, be ready.—Countrymen, how would it be If all our former battles, our wrestles by land and sea, Waterloo, Trafalgar, Inkerman, all were mere Lessons of infant schooling? How if the test is here? How if the long strange story has come to a point at last When the land must strike for Empire, or be but a kingdom past? Rome and Greece sank downward, every dog has his day,— Every country a splendour, a crown, a change, a decay. Hear but the word of warning. Watch but the moments flee With the stout hearts ready to landward, and the brave eyes keen by sea; And by land and sea the petition from men and women alike, “God strike home for England, if the moment comes to strike!” November, 1908. A PROTEST I Just because I claim for woman highest rank and queenliest place In her glory, in her beauty, in her gentle perfect grace, Do I grieve to see her stooping to a quest the devil ordains, For the devil it is who blinds her, and the devil it is who gains. II Higher than the highest of angels, so is woman in her power: Envied of the stars and sunlight, making jealous bird and flower. When I wrote of Her triumphant, I was thinking of her eyes With the force of love within them, and the scorn of liars and lies. III Just because on her for ever turns the future of the race I would have her pure, imperial, flawless both in form and face: With a body like the marble and a rose's mystic power, Teaching outline to the sculptor, teaching sweetness to the flower. IV When I sang of Her victorious, I was dreaming not of those Whose ignoble hateful handling would deflower the fairest rose. I was singing of the victory of the passionate God who gleams In the eyes of English girlhood, and sends angels to her dreams. V If my words have been distorted, strained and twisted, misconceived, It is woman who has suffered, and the singer who has grieved. Though a larger danger threatens than the keenest pang to one: For the soul of woman altered, alters flower and star and sun. LE FAUX BONHOMME “You English are mad, mad, mad as March hares. What has come over you that you are so completely given over to suspicions quite unworthy of a great nation? What more can I do than I have done?...I bade one of my officers procure for me as exact an account as he could obtain of the number of combatants in South Africa on both sides, and of the actual position of the opposing forces. With the figures before me, I worked out what I considered to be the best plan of campaign under the circumstances, and submitted it to my General Staff for their criticism. Then I despatched it to England, and that document, likewise, is among the State papers at Windsor Castle, awaiting the severely impartial verdict of history.” —The Kaiser, in the Daily Telegraph of October 28, 1908. “The Kaiser told Mr. Hale that King Edward had been hounding and humiliating him for two years, and he was exasperated; that Germany was the paramount power in Europe, and England was trying to neutralize her power; that he (the Emperor) held France in the hollow of his hand, and Russia was of no account since the Japanese War. “That if a pan-European war were inevitable the sooner it came the better, because he was now ready, and was tired of the suspense; that Great Britain had been a decadent nation ever since her victory over the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, because her cause was unrighteous and ungodly, and Divine judgment was bound eventually to overtake the powerful nation that waged such a war; that the Anglo-Japanese alliance was an iniquitous alliance against all the white races. England was proving absolutely her faithlessness as a Christian nation.” —New York World, November 22, 1908. “Why will you never trust me? What do my actions say? When your generals flagged and loitered, when your African wealth was at stake, I sent for the facts and the figures—devoted the best of a day To settling for Roberts and Buller the road that their troops should take. “In the archives of Windsor Castle you will find my maps and my plans. History will do me justice: the ages that come will show That my heart was one with England's, one if ever a man's Strong heart beat for England, in that dread ‘Black Week’ of her woe. “Yes: I am getting indignant. Too long your papers have sneered And I lose at last all patience. I bubble and boil and chafe. When Russia and France were plotting, it was I who interfered: And I wired to Windsor Castle, to tell them England was safe. “My ships for the far Pacific with purest friendly intent I am scheming and building and fitting. Who knows what Japan may say With her guns to the old-world nations, the Powers of the Continent? The thunder of German broadsides may change the fate of a fray.” So he declared, the Kaiser. But then to the West he turned And he spoke in the ear of the writer, the Yankee editor, Hale. And these are the thoughts he uttered, a lesson for all concerned, And once for all with a vengeance the Kaiser lifted the veil. “Hounded, pestered and flouted by England's Monarch, I feel That the moment is ripe for decision. If war in the end must be I would rather suspense were over, I am ready to draw the steel: I believe in the Zeppelin air-ship, though England trusts in the sea. “If all the nations in fury arise and collide and ignite All that I ask for reward of putting the match to the flame Will be Egypt, poor little Egypt: this, and the mad delight Of feeling myself a war-god, a giant force in the game. “Bismarck humbled the Frenchmen. What if a greater thing Looms and rises before me—to prison no Emperor now But to darken the splendour of England, to hunt and humble a King? To chase and harry the hunter, to steal from the topmost bough? “What was the glory of Bismarck, compared to the glory of him Who, seeing the Transvaal farmers by England oppressed, downtrod, Shall arise as a Priest and a Prophet, majestic, immaculate, grim, The sword, the revolver and rifle, the scourge and the dagger of God?” So in the month of November, with double and petulant tongue, On an Englishman, then on a Yankee, the Kaiser foisted his freaks. And this was the nations' comment, the judgment of old and of young: “Listen and learn from the Kaiser. Believe not a word that he speaks.” December, 1908. LORD ROBERTS' SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS Monday, November 23, 1908. At a moment in our history when our foremost statesmen stood Mute and foiled and cowed and futile, things of clay and shapes of wood, Rose a soldier, and he pleaded with the wavering multitude. Never yet for God and England, soldier spake a nobler word. While the querulous lords around him mixed in conclave and conferred England's heart made solemn answer, and the starriest heights were stirred. Never yet austerer moment in the history of the race Brought the halting nation grimly, yet superbly, face to face With the God who guards our England by His sword-arm and His grace. Never yet diviner instant in the days that were and are Dawned in fire upon our planet, made man lordlier, kinglier far, For the destiny of England shapes the future of our star. All the constellations follow this our stately star's control And the vast magnetic currents through the suns and systems roll Hurled from planet unto planet, as on earth from soul to soul. He who lost a son for England as he flashed along the fray, Here in London, in the dimness of the English winter day, Drew his sword again for England, and he flung the sheath away. Clearly, calmly, very gently, yet with somewhat of high scorn, Spake the Soldier to the lordlets, and his fervent words were borne Far beyond the English borders, to the sunset and the morn. East and West, to all the cities where the British flag still flies Sped the word that slew deception and that foiled the god of lies, Scoffed at ever by the weaklings, welcomed ever by the wise. Later on, in days we know not, when beyond our fairest dreams England forth upon the peoples with a stainless splendour gleams, Men will grasp what that word scattered of a thousand hellish schemes. Judas laughing, reincarnate, sat triumphant on a throne: But he shuddered at the trumpet as the sudden blast was blown And he knew his hour was over, and his boastings all outgrown. England's unreturning moment and the doom of traitorous hordes Came like lightning through the midnight when with words like strokes of swords Roberts spoke for truth and England to the people, and the lords. THE MODERN WOMAN I What an abyss for woman! Lo, what a depth to fall! She who might be the helper, angel and guide of all, Changed to a frenzied creature, abject, lunatic, wild,— Something of hell in her madness, something in her of a child! II Curses on those who did it, the elder women who taught English girls base lessons, poisoning soul and thought! Cursed be these, the liars, who troubled the young girl's creed— Told her that men were reptiles, reptiles they who mislead. III Cursed be these who, knowing nothing of love or of man, First the pitiful story of wrong and deceit began! What can set right or atone for it? Nothing, till hell's waves whirl Round the throat of a woman who lies to the soul of a girl. IV Feminine tongues, snake-skilful, have brought us even to this. Women who never have known the love in a strong man's kiss, Never have known sweet passion that lights the land and the sea, Never have known, nor will know it, while stars and the sun shall be,— V These, these most, these only, have changed the current of life To a torrent of blood-red waters, and changed love's joy to a strife: Mixing their base ambitions, their lust and anger and greed, With the thoughts of flower-white girlhood, with our maidens' pure sweet creed. VI “Man is only a cipher”—so they, insolent, say. “Ours is the sex victorious. Ours is the world of to-day.” So they write foul lustful stories, and they poison England's life; And they leave no English maiden fit for an English wife. VII In the old glad days our women were noblest of all upon earth: Purest, happiest, sweetest; history's fairest birth. But now they are changed and defiant. They have learned from the lips that lie That man is a brute and a satyr, developed straight from the stye. VIII That is the teaching pestilent of the elder women whose lies Have saddened the sun of England, and clouded the English skies. Woman was once a flower, a sunlit beautiful rose. Now she carries a dog-whip, and slashes at friends and foes. IX War between woman and woman, mad war, war to the knife, War between woman and mankind, war between husband and wife, This would result from the contest. Think you it turns upon votes? The suffragettes' flag, Defiance, in a fiercer hurricane floats. X Contempt for the old traditions, scorn of love and of man, Hate of the older England, the merciless creed of a clan. A strange-eyed group hysterical, women in nought but the name, This it will mean for England—and ours, our own, is the shame. XI Shame on the manhood of England, that has let this dark thing rise To strength and to vehement boasting beneath unvigilant eyes! Shame on the manhood of England, that has let this come to pass! Shame on the men of putty, seduced by the women of brass! XII Man was the leader of woman: she looked to the man to lead. She loved and obeyed and trusted. Love was her soul's one creed. He has failed in his sacredest duty. The moment he flinched and fell Woman became the leader, and is leading her sex to hell. XIII Certain the end is, certain. If a virile race should arise, The sceptre will pass from our people, abject before our eyes. Never a nation prospers, not even the nation of bees, Where the feminine hosts are the leaders and the males are dwarfed and at ease. XIV “Read not the older authors. Let Charles Dickens alone. His women are namby-pamby: abject slaves we disown. Be not deceived by Shakespeare. Milton? What was he worth? Rather study Lake Harris: a seer and a god upon earth. XV “Man is a lust organic, “Man is a tyrannous, organic lust.” —Thomas Lake Harris. a tyrant lewd and supreme. Woman no more shall be subject. Women, wake from your dream! America's girls shall be leaders. The scorpion, man, shall be trod Deep underfoot for ever, by woman the star-crowned God. XVI “Keep but the stripes for mankind—vitriol, whips and blows. The stars are wanted for woman, who, scorning a slave's repose, Arises, terrible, vengeful, a Mother with eyes of flame, Driving her spouse before her, a man-form timid and tame. XVII “Woman must be the chooser, the arbiter. Hers is the word That gives to her husband his mandate, bids passion speak and be heard. If man should rebel when we treat him—much as a cat or a tyke— The women who spit at policemen will never be slow to strike. XVIII “We have lost the sense of smelling. See Mrs. Swiney's book, The Awakening of Women. The authoress maintains that women have largely lost the sense of smell, and are consequently diviner and higher beings than man: smell being, in her opinion, the lowest and most animal of the senses, and therefore the first sense lost in an upward evolution. We leave it to man who knows The scent of a rose from an onion, the scent of a shrimp from a rose. In our progress onward and upward, the animal gifts we resign: And garlic is even as violets, and drainage is like woodbine. XIX “Our lips are not eager for rapture of passion, for this we scorn. Two embraces, two only, if two babes have to be borne! Passion is only admissible, as a means for the procreation of children, according to the repulsive teaching of the neo-American female physiologists. We are passionless, vigilant, virgin, loud-tongued, sexless, austere. Do you doubt us? Hand us a dog-whip. That argument makes all clear.” XX Such are the words of woman, literal, monstrous, fact, To man and to woman her sister, the prelude to monstrous act. Cursed be all such women! Blessed the first that goes Along the street in the sunshine, sweet, a girl and a rose! THE PATRIOT VOTER “I am not interested in the nonsense Roberts talks.” —Letter of an Englishwoman of the year 1908. I “Wildest talk of an invasion! How can ever such thing be? Give the suffrage to the women, give the vote to them and me. Trust us—trust no ships or weapons—trust not bayonets or the sea. II “Roberts tells us—Roberts warns us—he is talking ‘nonsense’ quite. I and God can put the Germans by our double vote to flight. If I lift my star-ringed finger, they will vanish in a night. III “No: it does not ‘interest’ us, all this talk of swords and tars. We are daughters of the future, we are sisters of the stars, And our dreams are dreams pacific, not man's murderous cult of Mars. IV “We have never read a history, we know nought of gun or boat. England does not ‘interest’ us. Let the throne and country float Straight away to wreck stupendous, so we only get a vote! V “Little England is our England. Perish India, mount and plain! Let some German, or some Russian, o'er the dark-skinned myriads reign! Nought to us the thing can matter, if our petty ends we gain. VI “Are the Indian mobs seditious? Send a peaceful message there. Is an Englishwoman murdered? Hold a meeting, and declare That if several more are murdered, we shall think it most unfair. VII “That's the way to hold an Empire. It was sternly, keenly won. But a swordless grasp may keep it, let no flash be seen of gun, Not a word be heard of anger, till our mission's fully done. VII “This indeed is our proud mission—what was given us, to betray: What was trusted to our keeping, with both hands to fling away: What was won by battling centuries, to cast from us in a day.” POWDER AND PATRIOTISM “Dulce et decorum est pro patriâ mori.” —Horace. “Is ultra-patriotism a good thing?” —British citizen of the twentieth century. I No doubt it is good and pleasant to find in the whole wide earth Valour and strength and beauty, virtue and grace and worth: It is right to be just to a Frenchman or German, an alien birth. II Victors in Art and in Science may Russian or Prussian be. A German may study triumphant the nerves of a gnat or a flea. Be large-souled, cosmopolitan. It matters nothing to me. III Never be insular, narrow. Teach your children at school Never to fight or be furious—to follow the golden rule. If a fool should strike at your left cheek, turn your right to the fool. IV This is excellent teaching: this is the fashion and mode. Yet there are articles two, unchanged in my militant code— That our bayonets refuse to bend and our powder consent to explode. The British powder is said, on good authority, to be greatly inferior to the German. —December, 1908. V Russians, Germans, Italians, Austrians, Japs and Turks, All are hearty good fellows, pleasing in ways and works: Yet they have guns, torpedoes, swords, destroyers and dirks. VI Taking account of all things, thinking still in the road That Nelson and Wellington followed, I cleave and cling to my code— That British bayonets shall curve not, and British powder explode. A WORD FOR THE ARMY “Roberts is nothing but a soldier. He naturally sees as a soldier.... “The military spirit is the very child of the sex-devil—dividing into dualistic ranks class against class, and nation against nation, and sex against sex! ... “I believe in a former letter I referred to a future life in which the Ego would no longer see, through sex bias, the ‘things that belong to God.’” —English lady, and would-be voter. “To Carlyle, nineteen centuries after Christ, as to Thucydides, four centuries before Christ, war is the supreme expression of the energy of a State as such, the supreme, the tragic hour, in the life-history of the city, the nation, as such.... “In the light of History, universal peace appears less as a dream than as a nightmare which shall be realized only when the ice has crept to the heart of the sun, and the stars, left black and trackless, start from their orbits.... “With us, let me repeat, the decision rests, with us and with this generation. Never since on Sinai God spoke in thunder has mandate more imperative been issued to any race, city, or nation than now to this nation and to this people.” —“Reflections on the Origins and Destiny of Imperial Britain.” By J. A. Cramb, M.A., Professor of Modern History, Queen's College, London. I 1 Hark to a patriot's warning, worthy to store and keep In our minds as a boon for ever, a prophecy sage and deep! —“‘Roberts sees as a soldier’: this and nought else is he. I am a woman-voter. As I woman, I think and see. ‘Roberts is only a soldier.’ I am for love and peace: So I war with the old sex-devil, the devil of Rome and Greece, The devil that so divides us. When sex with sex is one The unified human creature will arise and shine as the sun. 2 “We must be unisexual. One sex, one alone, Stands erect in the heavens, and stares at God on his throne. All will be well when woman, with power and victory shod, Destroys the division of sexes and blends with the sexless God. From this division of sexes evil and sin had birth. If man had been woman, and woman had never been woman on earth, All had been well with the peoples, clothed in beauty and grace: Bearded and moustached woman will save and exalt the race. 3 “The old mere masculine error of worship of form must cease. Our booted and tight-laced beauty eclipses the beauty of Greece. We are the form triumphant: no forms that Phidias saw Could stir the beholder to terror, shaped by a loftier law Than the law of sex we abolish, the law of the man and the maid, Fit for the animal two-sexed, the law whose lessons degrade, The law of the flowers' obsceneness, the law of the birds' loose joy, The law that our teachers have given us the mandate now to destroy. 4 “Why will you understand not that sex shall be overthrown And the perfume of blossoms scattered, and the scent of a rose unknown? For our sanctified nostrils smell not, and our glorified nerves are vexed No longer by dreams of passion, that thrill not the forms unsexed. Vast is the pure deliverance. Chain upon chain might fall; But the chain of the old sex-devil was the firmest chain of all. Following scent, the senses will drop from us one by one Till we hear not music, and feel not the lewd male warmth in the sun. 5 “Men will be lifted and gladdened when intellect keen they find In woman. The soul's embraces, the kisses of mind and mind, Will wholly supplant the kisses from lip to lip that flew When the young world laughed like a satyr, and its passionate young lusts grew. From the graze of the tiniest pin-point to the thrust of the savagest sword Every pain is by reason of man the reasonless lord. Change but man to a woman, pare but his tiger claws: Then Eve may re-enter her Eden, as man the devil withdraws.” II 1 But the birds and the blossoms answered, and the universe of God, Fair as when never a woman with womanless fool's feet trod Its hills and its flower-sown valleys—“If sex were lonely and one The stars and the moon would perish, and night would involve the sun. Not a star could gaze at its Maker, nor could God's eyes gaze at a rose, If the glory of sex were abolished, the splendour of love that goes Flaming from planet to planet, flashing from height to height, For the passion of woman for man is the passion of God for light. 2 “The passion of man for woman is the passion of God for the rose, His love for the soul of its sweetness, the marvellous scent that grows Pure and soft on the senses till we know that the rose is one With the passion of woman the blossom, with the passion of man the sun. If the sexless lie and murderous that the sexless women have told Could be true, were it but for a moment, God's heart would be changed and old: All things sweet must vanish, flowers no more could be: And the radiance purple or sapphire would fade from the fields of the sea.” 3 Love and battle together: this is the law of the race. Strength and the masculine sword-arm: feminine curves and grace. So hath the Lord designed it: so are his strange thoughts hurled From man to woman, from woman to man, and from world to world. Conflict, war, for ever! Palestine, Rome and Greece! Conquering Goths and the Vandals! Races never at peace! One thing only is certain: that Mars was armoured and shod With fire and his red sword sharpened by the hand of actual God. 4 Nobler the ends for ever of the desperate strifes may be: Loftier England's message as her hand grows firm on the sea: Clearer her voice and her mandate as Nelson and Wellington meet: The one with his word to our army, the other guiding our fleet. But never till all stars darken and a sunless sky grows cold, Never while morning's mantle is broidered on boundless gold, While lives and the honour of women turn on the stroke of a sword, May we put the steel and the scabbard back in the hand of the Lord. 5 Never—as Ruskin told us—can we draw diviner breath Than in that great game of battle “where the stakes are life and death.” So hath the Lord ordained it: so must this great thing be: While a sword can flame in the sunlight, or a ship's gun flash on the sea. Deep in the heart of our nation is love of the true and right; Sternest passion for justice, passionate search for light. While in the world are falsehood, treachery, craft and crime, Armies of unseen warriors call on the sons of time. III 1 Hear not the voices of women, sent to cajole and mislead, The elder deceiving the younger, spreading a sexless creed: Wholly divorced from England, a danger and curse to the land, For their craft would weaken our manhood, and wheedle the sword from the hand. For the sake of the nobler woman, the woman whom Dickens drew, Milton and Shelley and Shakespeare, the woman tender and true, “Dark and true and tender is the North.” —Tennyson. Pure and divine and gentle, the woman whom England breeds, England, England only, hear not the false-tongued creeds. 2 For the sake of the women of England, silent, loving unheard, Those who have not yet spoken the sweet imperative word; For the sake of the trust reposed in us, never reposed in a land, In an old-world race or nation, direct from destiny's hand; While the golden chance is given us, before the hour has fled, Vote, ordain, that an army, noble and nobly led, Shall spring from the manhood of England, armoured in truth and light Passionate only for justice, stern alone for the right. 3 Once to a race, once only, Time speaks the imperial word. There are other races ripening: there are other clarions heard. Still the chance is before us, and evil counsellors call, Saying, “What do we want with an army? Our ships can answer for all!” If we heed the smooth-tongued pleaders, whether men or women they be, If we add not a nation's army to a nation's strength at sea, Destruction huge, undreamed of, on a craven land may leap; Our fathers won at the sword-point, and the sword alone can keep. 4 But surely the call will be answered. Surely from hand to hand. The signal torch will hasten, till its bright flame fills the land. Surely from woman to woman the clear strong word will fly: “To part from the love of England is worse, far worse, than to die.” To say that the old Field-Marshal, urgent for England's sake, Was talking but as a soldier, to sneer when a world is at stake, This—and a woman did it—is worse, ignobler far, Than war, though war be a demon, and war's red crown be a scar. 5 How if God “sees as a soldier”? How if from height to height The bugle of endless battle peals for the endless right? How if thunders the thunder, lightens the lightning's flame Ever in scorn of meanness, ever in Love's own name? How if an army knightly, strong through love of the land, Gains from God in the highest might to war and withstand? How if an army defending fields no foeman has trod Strikes with the force stupendous of the sword and the passion of God? THE ELEVENTH HOUR I Still an hour is left to hearken: still an hour is left to wake: Still an hour to stifle discord and join hands for England's sake. England, generous, largely trusting, asks what course will Asquith steer? Asks for his sake, not for her sake, for her brightening road is clear. II Yet a moment's space is left him. Once for all he must decide: Flinch and cower and lapse and perish, crawl and whine and skulk and hide, Or stand forth an English statesman, stronger when the sword-blades gleam And the thunder-clash of conflict scares the hucksters from their dream. III But if craven be the answer, if we hear some timorous plea, From stern city unto city and from furious sea to sea Will the Empire's verdict echo, flashed along the wires of time, Judgment endless, unexampled, on an unexampled crime: IV “Leave to Asquith and McKenna, and the anti-English crew Who could twist and cant and shuffle, while the grim risk deadlier grew, As they tumble from their benches and regain their jackals' den, The contempt of English school-girls and the curse of English men.” March 26, 1909. RETRIBUTION While our rivals, ardent, eager, toiling on from day to day, Seek to win and grasp the Trident, “The Trident must be in our fist.” —German Emperor. rule the waves with sovereign sway, Our bold striving, our whole effort, is to fling the gift away, To procure a moment's respite, one more instant of delay. “Cease to probe and carp and question. Nay, inquiry shall be none. We are sapient trusty Sea-Lords, all we do is wisely done. If we choose to work in darkness, why let in the dangerous sun? All is ready: armour-plating, mast and halyard, shot and gun. “Never dream you cannot trust us. Mark how confident and clear Rings the German bright war-trumpet on pale Europe's listening ear! Every resonant note is peaceful, promise ample and sincere. We will blow a friendly bugle, for our bugling friends to hear.” But the nation rose in anger: as one man the nation rose And a stormier Trumpet sounded, for it thundered forth the close Of an era of deception, lies and frauds and shifts and shows, And a fiery retribution on our leaders, not our foes. March, 1909. SONNETS OF EMPIRE SONNET I A PRIME MINISTER With clank of hammer and with clink of steel The German dockyards echo, day and night. Unnumbered legions ripen for the fight While English statesmen fawn and cringe and kneel. In English dockyards men without a meal Stand idle, sullen, in most piteous plight. Asquith, found brazen in the whole world's sight, Stamps truth to dust with a most shameless heel. Our Navy chained, mishandled, and held back, Pants feebly along the inexorable track, While the grim German Navy swells apace. Though this man knows and England knows he lies, No thunder threatens from the silent skies And no truth's Angel smites him in the face. December 21, 1909. SONNET II A PRAYER That these may pass from power, and men may rise Born of the moment, equal to the time, Keen-eyed to probe the black depths of a crime, Most proudly fearless, mercilessly wise! Armoured to win the incalculable prize A nobler England flashes forth, sublime, Whose fleets shall carry peace from clime to clime, Or thunder war, till the last despot dies. One moment of sharp struggle grim and grave, Then with her heel upon the Arch-Serpent's head May England stand, she who just now was dead And no man deemed that God or man could save! But now her feet are swift upon the wave And golden morning lightens round her tread December 21, 1909. SONNET III A CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER “Lord Savile, speaking at Eakring in support of Mr. Hume Williams, Unionist Candidate for the Bassetlaw division of Notts, said that 200 members of the House of Lords had been in the Army and Navy, and seventy served as volunteers in the South African War. “What was Mr. Lloyd-George doing while these peers were gallantly fighting for their Queen and country, and England was mourning the loss of so many brave sons? He was sitting comfortably in the House of Commons. This was the man—this miserable Little Englander—this enemy of his King and country—who now sought to destroy the Lords, and who considered no device too mean or low to attain this end.” —Daily Mail, December 23, 1909. The straight good thrust!—and every English soul That watched the blow felt that the stroke was meet. When true men speak, base demagogues retreat Or snarl and foam, furious beyond control. Remember how this man, when horror stole From home to home with red news to repeat, Sat with the dogs who yelped at each defeat And louder grew, while darker grew the goal. If in some Dantesque fashion stern and great Vengeance on hound-like act and miscreant's lie Could fall, would not this man be hurled by Fate Far from the stars, the sea-waves and the sky, For ever doomed to twist and writhe among The venomous refuse of his own foul tongue? SONNET IV PERFECT IGNOMINY To tax the rich and make the poor man's lot Harder; to watch the German fleet expand; To leave our Navy weak and undermanned; To hear truth told and alter not a jot; To shuffle, quibble, drivel, palter, plot; To skulk round corners, lest some woman's hand Strike; to give aid to every alien land; To leave our working folk to starve and rot; To clip the Army and curtail the Fleet; To cringe to every rowdy in the street; To cadge for votes, half knave, half smug-faced fool; Was this enough? Nay, he must add to this A lecherous longing for the Irish kiss, A shameless rank adultery with Home Rule. December 31, 1909. SONNET V VICTORY At the General Election of January, 1910, the Unionist Party, in the face of lying and misrepresentation unprecedented in English electoral history, secured a net gain of 105 seats. The powers of darkness shudder, as the morn Breaks, and a newer nobler day begun Restores to England gladness and the sun. 'Mid lies and deeds too base for aught but scorn Rulers 'mid lies and base devices born Feel death upon them, see their brief reign done, And watch the swift sands through the hour-glass run, Crime-smeared, by foul dissensions racked and torn. The traitors slowly pass into the night With furtive wolf-like gaze and shackled hands, While England in the golden sunlight stands, Her eyes made glorious with imperial light, And one wild trumpet-blast proclaims her free From dawn to sunset and from sea to sea. February 6, 1910. SONNET VI “ONCE AGAIN” “What are these that howl and hiss across the strait of westward water? What is he who floods our ears with speech in flood? See the long tongue lick the dripping hand that smokes and reeks of slaughter! See the man of words embrace the man of blood!” Swinburne's poem, “The Commonweal, a Song for Unionists”: published in the Times on the eve of the Home Rule Election of 1886. Another long tongue licks another hand, And once again the battle must be fought As though the former strange great fight were nought. Wrath, doom and darkness, shadow all the land. Left are a few—a staunch unbroken band Who will not bow the knee. Unbribed, unbought, They give their lives, their prayers, their toil, their thought, Freely; and if they fall, their fall is grand. Men who loved England, when her nobler heart Tore Gladstone's webs and sophistries apart And wrenched the clean truth from him without fear, Stand firm: while all wise spirits and faithful pray That scorn may sweep such Ministers away, Lest blood should stain the Coronation Year. December 11, 1910. SONNET VII A LIBERAL PROGRAMME Though Gladstone erred, it was a Titan's sin. But his successors—Liberals? What of these? To keep in place by crawling on their knees Through muddiest Labour bogs, or plunging in: To make five hundred Peers, all on the grin, 'Mid scorn of proud Dominions over-seas: Shameless, to drink shame's blackest filthiest lees: To play with flames of War, so they but win: This is their plan. To build their power on lies: To toss each dog the sop that satisfies: Then, once their project is in perfect swing, To prostitute the Flag 'neath Redmond's feet, Reduce our Navy to a fourth-class Fleet, To sell the nation and coerce the King. December 11, 1910. SONNET VIII “BRAVE WORDS!” “I will suppose that owing to some cause the Liberal Party was called upon to deal with this great Constitutional question of the Government of Ireland in a position where it was only a minority dependent on the Irish vote for converting it into a majority. “Now, gentlemen, I tell you seriously and solemnly that although I believe the Liberal Party itself to be honourable, patriotic, and trustworthy, in such a position as this it would not be safe for it to enter upon the consideration of the principle of a measure with respect to which at every step of its progress it would be in the power of a party coming from Ireland to say: ‘Unless you do this and unless you do that we will turn you out tomorrow...’ “Not only the Liberal Party, but the Empire, will be in danger, because questions of the gravest moment and of Imperial weight and of vast consequences may come forward, and there will be no party qualified to deal with them in that independence of position which alone can secure a satisfactory and an honourable issue.” —Mr. Gladstone, speaking at Edinburgh on November 9, 1885. Brave words!—But three months later he betrayed England, himself, and Ireland. He forbore To keep the “serious solemn” oath he swore. All that his hands had built up, he unmade. Men, foul with blood, he fondled and obeyed. Traitors attacked. He opened wide the door; Warned us what not to do, then did far more. A trickster's shuffling meanest game he played. First having spoken truth, he did the lie. Invoking “Empire,” next he chose to stake Empire upon the casting of a die. He sealed his murdered honour in the tomb: Then, with a people weeping for his sake, Marched madly towards the inexorable doom. December 12, 1910. SONNET IX OUR “MODERATES” I marked the Hell that will be. There I found With thinnest star-flame given them for a light Our “Moderates,” and I counted in that night Grey, Haldane, Morley, Birrell, hound by hound. Alive and damned, by his own falsehoods bound, Birrell felt Ireland's hate like poison bite: Morley, with India saved in his despite, Had India's curse to hold him underground. I watched in dust and chains the docile Crewe Who sneered at Roberts, yet no lightning slew: Who, 'mid the laughter of the House of Lords Feeblest and foolishest of all things born, Too weak for wrath of man or woman's scorn, Moved to send Germany our broken swords. December 13, 1910. SONNET X THE CHARGE OF THE PEERS' BRIGADE “Noble six hundred!” —Tennyson. Asquith's five hundred Peers! Brave souls who stoop When Redmond foams with slaughterous intent To be his serving-men: bold warriors bent Like reeds when Dillon's Irish curse and hoop. Weighted with unctuous phrases till they droop, Chaste flowers of choicest Nonconformist scent, May not their robes be splashed, their ermine rent? Hell's scorn may greet and blast the godly troop. Think how tumultuous England will deride, Think how our kindred o'er the seas will jeer, As each proud noble marches to his place, His belly puffed with hopes, his brain with pride, His past anonymous, his future clear, Gold in his hands, and Judas in his face! December 13, 1910. SONNET XI FIELD-MARSHAL EARL ROBERTS He told the truth to England.—Never yet Has any told the straight truth without fear But England's deepest soul has given an ear. The Commons paltered, timorous statesmen met: Not one would trust the nation. 'Mid regret, Hate, anger, indecision, dawns the year That should have brought the imperial moment here. Lurid at sunrise, how will this year set? One thing we know—that one man spoke the truth And warned a palsied people. Once he drew, And lit the darkness with a sudden sword. He shamed our craven Church, our cowardly youth, Our men debauched in brothel or in pew. He wielded, once, the lightning of the Lord. December 14, 1910. SONNET XII M. MÉLINE AND MR. ASQUITH “I care no more for patriotism than for the dirt under my finger-nails.” —Speech by a Socialist. Once, only once, a group of men held sway As wholly false and despicable as those Whose grovelling souls dishonour and depose Freedom, inveterate serfs whom slaves obey. Till the black Dreyfus night-mare passed away From wakened France when truth and Zola rose, Méline was Asquith.—At one victim's throes Tempestuous France grew armed, to mock or slay. But what of men as truthless and as coarse Here, who, for some malign nefarious scheme, Plunge on from crime to crime without remorse: Who, with mad curse and gibe or vulture's scream, Cry, till their cowardly senseless throats turn hoarse, “Empire is but a bauble or a dream?” December 20, 1910. SONNET XIII ENGLAND DECADENT “This people was once a terror to the world.” —Chatham. If we are doomed to watch the mighty land That warriors' swords and singers' souls made great Reel like a helmless vessel on her fate, Saved by no mastering voice, no pilot's hand: If leaders take to flight when fools withstand: If, called to manhood's service for the State, Men tremble and argue, plead and hesitate: If we turn suppliants, who could once command: If England's arm has lost its power to strike, If England's heart has lost its power to feel, If England's tongue has lost its power to speak Truth to her statesmen like a thunder-peal, War would be better; wherein strong and weak May perish, undishonoured, all alike. December 22, 1910. SONNET XIV CHRISTMAS, 1910 “Watcher, what of the night?”—The night is black For the most part, but here and there a star Shines forth,—how few and faint, how dim and far! The thunder of guns upon the forward track Is ceaseless. Limp and flabby, soft and slack, From ball to concert, club to motor-car Our “men” escort our “women.’ On a par The sexes seem, for sex alike they lack. Haunted by dreams of old Victorian days Poets and thinkers contemplate, alone, The ruins of an Empire half o'er-thrown: Watch sparks predicting no bright Christmas blaze But conflagrations kindled in wild ways, Saddest and fiercest that this land has known. December 23, 1910. SONNET XV THERE AND HERE On December 21 and 22, 1910, two English officers, Captain Trench and Lieutenant Brandon, were tried at Leipzig, for espionage. They received a singularly fair and generous trial. Here, ceaseless discord, clash of class and class, Ministers kicked by Socialistic feet Or hoofed by Redmond's lambs that roar and bleat, Now with mild accents, now with lungs of brass. There, as from this distracted land we pass, Militant order, tranquil and complete: A German Army and a German Fleet Backed by Crown, nobles, peasants, people, en masse. There, a fair judgment given by generous men Who, safe and unassailable at home, Conscious of strength, can hold an even way: While, here, our furious anti-patriots foam And gnash their teeth like vicious curs at bay, Or plot with Lloyd-George in some miners' den. December 23, 1910. SONNET XVI THE WRITING ON THE WALL “All history is the history of States once powerful and then decaying. Is Great Britain to be numbered among the decaying States?” —Joseph Chamberlain. To count the swallows flying o'er the pond Or circling round the pump: to sit and doze While nation after nation gains and grows: To march thus far, but not a step beyond. To win an Empire—hugely to despond, To hurl it from us: the Election The Election of December, 1910. shows That half the nation thus decides. Who knows What spell has fallen from what enchanter's wand? We who dictated are content to bend: To watch our fleets rejected of the sea,— India, South Africa, in alien hands: To hear the savage laughter of the lands Crying, “This was England once. Now this is She; Proud at the outset, abject at the end.” December 27, 1910. SONNET XVII THE DECLARATION OF LONDON Nations have risen and fallen, but none as yet While every sane and patriot voice withstands Has signed its own death-warrant, on demands Most paltry most irrevocably set, Though wrath and unappeasable regret Thrill through the hearts and spirits of friendliest lands. Like silliest fish lured on by subtlest hands We plunge and leap and dart into the net. Of all man's history's base and cowardly deeds At which the historian sickens or despairs No cowardlier baser deed was lightlier done Than this that eloquent infamy prepares, This,—that will darken if the plot succeeds Our Empire's sunlit sea-way, and the sun. May 2, 1911. TWO SONNETS SONNET XVIII FOR CORONATION DAY, THURSDAY, JUNE 22, 1911. I At this stern moment when black treason prowls From land to land, and base sedition plots, While patriotism shrinks, and manhood rots, And womanhood, degraded, shrieks and howls, And decadent girls, half-dressed and eyed like ghouls, Crowd mocking streets: while Irish, Welsh and Scots, Would have the kingdom parcelled into lots: While Little England snarls and spits and scowls: At such an hour, when traitorous tongues go free And every loyal heart commits a crime, A keener sword is needed than of rhyme That, Royal at home, Imperial o'er the sea, Our English Monarch's opening reign may be The turning-point of history and of time. SONNET XIX FOR CORONATION DAY, THURSDAY, JUNE 22, 1911. II No task uncertain, no half-dubious thing Is set before us. England up or down Must journey, and with England moves the Crown. Not to an Emperor, not to any King Did seasons strange, austere or joyous, bring So vast a chance of an undreamed renown: Whether the statesmen-chatterers praise or frown, Or world-wide jealousy point its venomed sting. Dark India summons with a soul of fire: Far Canada's plains, each snow-lit mountain-gorge, Australia's heart, and Africa's desire: While all who still can fight and still can pray Cry, on this stately Coronation Day, “God guard our Empire, and God save King George!” SONNET XX THE GREAT BETRAYAL The Parliament Bill was passed by the House of Lords on August 10, 1911. Fear, treachery, folly, intrigue, all that's base And foul in politics, heaped up pell-mell Converged, as if through some magician's spell, When Lansdowne and his fate stood face to face. Was no high instinct left, no pride of race? Prone at the feet of Ford the noblesse fell: And for one night the House of Lords was hell, “His Lordship” striving to outlie “His Grace.” Then...forth the traitors surged, one rabble-rout, Each blindly pressing first to scamper out, Lords, Bishops, one great shameless wrestling sea, While from the tongues of those who still stood fast As the black herd of wolves and apes swept past Rose with a cheer the name of Halsbury. SONNET XXI THE NAVAL PRIZE BILL The Naval Prize Bill, which carries with it the Declaration of London, was thrown out by the House of Lords on Tuesday, December 12, 1911. Crippled and fettered, shorn of half their power, Yet once again, as often, England's Lords, Stood between her and meanest foemen's swords Nor were found wanting in the crucial hour. The Code wherethrough as from a vantage tower Fly all the poisoned darts of alien hordes, Devised to maim and bind her as with cords, Shrinks like a parchment which red flames devour. This much is left—the horror to conceive (For this we must) that Englishmen were found Of mind so feeble or of soul so base As to fling German filth in England's face: Conscious, to sell their country and achieve Damnation here and elsewhere beyond bound. December 13, 1911. SONNET XXII WOMAN SUFFRAGE With screech of parrot or with yelp of fox The wild dishevelled sisters cry for votes: While each who honours woman sadly notes How in vast thoughtless heartless dangerous flocks These sexless creatures surge against the rocks Of duty, love, and wreck their fragile boats Till only some stray spar or top-mast floats, Sight pitiful 'mid the rough green waves' shocks. So, beaten down, dismayed and out of heart, Fed forcibly on their own turgid dreams, Will these mad women swiftly plunge apart From all the world of work and honest schemes, From noble passion and from glorious Art, While Pethick Lawrence rants and Pankhurst screams. January 23, 1912 SONG FOR THE BOYS OF BRITAIN I A trumpet sounds that never sounded In all the history of the race. A danger threatens, grim, unbounded: Strange peril stares us in the face. But all our Empire's grand old story Is yours, from which to learn the way Through duty done to deathless glory: He conquers who can best obey. Be ready and steady Of hand and heart and eye. Work or fight for England! For England live or die! II No time have English lads to trifle: The day of faltering purpose ends. Drill, scout, grow apt with sword and rifle; Make England's hills and streams your friends. From sea to sea, from Scottish borders To Dover's cliffs of snowiest white, Learn every road. Your sudden orders May flash from guns some noon or night. Our England is in danger: Danger will vanish when Her men are all as giants And all her boys are men. III For all our fathers died to gain; For all their sons must fight to keep; For meadow, mountain, sunlit plain, Tombs where our Titans' memories sleep; For all that England most esteems; For kindred lands beyond the foam; For hopes that flash through far-off dreams; For truth and right, for King and home; For Freedom ripening slowly, For all high aims, contend. The country trusts you wholly: Each may be England's friend. IV Behind you lie the deeds of daring That built the Empire you behold; High courage, honour, toil unsparing, And swords of steel and hearts of gold. A few short years! Then forth may thunder The trumpet-peal that calls on you, While weaklings palter, argue, blunder, To close your ranks, to dare and do. Be ready, be steady: Be men in thought and deed. Yours are the arms that England In days to come will need. THE HIGHER WOMAN I When the centuries' tasks are finished, and the light of judgment gleams Crowning the lonely fighters, making an end of dreams, Great will be our days' glory, that our century overthrew The devil of vivisection, whose red hand laughed as it slew. II Now, when woman arises, beautiful, pure-souled, strong, Eager to save the creatures whose moment of life we wrong,— Now that the hope in her glances brings new hope to the race, She, the divine crusader, in the war takes glorious place. III This is a quest for woman, for love is her soul's chief might, Love of the God of the sunshine, scorn of the devil of night, Hate of the hand that tortures, love of the skill that heals, But not by a butcher's study of a nerve that quivers and feels. IV This is a woman's question, if ever a question grew Large and pressing for woman, urgent, imminent, new. For our young girl-students suffer. Is it wise, is it safe, is it well To teach that the road to knowledge leads straight through the pit of hell? V How can woman be mother of love and of hope and of life If her heart be inured to the torture, her hands be trained to the knife? Harden the hearts of your maidens, and all the world turns grey: The sun grows dim in the heavens, the stars' crowns vanish away. VI Tear from the heart of a woman the tender and pitiful dream And you snatch from the skies their glory, you darken the moon's white gleam: You ruffle the souls of the roses, you ravish their scent from these, And you silence the voice of the summer that sounds in the song of the trees. VII To-day the word of the nations through the nobler womanhood speaks. Away with the darkling horror that flushes with shame the cheeks When we think that moment by moment, in London, day after day, Keen knives are athirst for the helpless, and brute hands ready to slay! VIII The thing is obscene, un-English; hateful, cowardly, base. The man who would visit his mother, or look his wife in the face, His red hand smelling of slaughter, his fingers foul from the crime, Is not the man whom a woman deems lord of the world and of time. IX Man is a god, deems woman—her sweet heart breaks when she knows That the brother she loved and prayed for was counting a torn frog's throes In some hellish hospital dungeon, watching it quiver and swerve, Or carving a bound live rabbit, dissecting muscle and nerve. X That was the work of the student, medical, masculine, grand, An honour to English science, the scalpel's gift to the land, While the student's wiser sister, with a knowledge nobler far, Found Christ's love in a flower, watched God's face in a star. XI But the thing must end for ever, the days of horror must close. A vast pure current of pity through the dawning century flows. Ever in woman's footsteps the angels of heaven have trod For the anger of love in a woman is the sternest anger of God. XII Yes: the anger of woman at an innocent child's deep wrong Or a coward's thrust at the creature that sought us with love or with song Is the wrath of Christ and his Father, the flash of the sun's keen sword, And the softest hand of woman deals the strongest stroke of the Lord. XIII All true souls in accordance here are firm and at one, Stern to resolve and determine that a royal deed be done. Here can nation and nation, man and woman, agree: Rulers of plains or of mountains, princes of land or sea. XIV Long and strange is the battle, patience and prayer we need: Faith in the hearts that follow, strength in the souls that lead. Eager and brave girl-soldier, here is a sword for your hand: And you use that sword for England, for love is the life of the land! XV Vast are the world's grim armies; millions trained to obey Wait but some general's orders to unsheathe wild swords and slay. But behind the men and women who follow love as a star Are unseen armies vaster, and a Leader mightier far.</field>
