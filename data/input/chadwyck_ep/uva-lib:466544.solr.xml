      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. COMMENCEMENT. The years appear to mock me as they fly, O heavenly Father! half my life is done, And yet my work is scarcely well begun. Grant me the power to do, before I die, Some work worth doing! Let me glorify Thee, and my Saviour! Grant me to achieve Some conquest for mankind; and let me leave Something behind me which, as time goes by, Into the common garner may be brought Of true and pure and fruitful human thought. On those foundations let me build, which lie Laid by no mortal hand; and when the flame Tries all things, what they are and whence they came, Oh, let my work abide eternally. COMPLETION. I know the builder's toil must go for nought Unless Thou build, Almighty! but I trust That not in vain from Thee, the Good and Just, Patience and strength and guidance have I sought. And now the work Thou gav'st me have I brought Back to Thee, finished; and I hope to be Counted a fellow-labourer with Thee, As one who worthily for truth has wrought. But if it be that I have toiled in vain, Let me not, Father! feel too deep a pain At disappointment of that great reward: But make my spirit to be one with Thine; For, whether failure or success be mine, Truth shall prevail, and Christ be ever Lord. MARY MAGDALENE ON THE MORNING OF THE RESURRECTION. A Recollection of Herbert's Picture of that Subject. ‚ÄúAs the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, A morning without clouds; When the tender grass springeth out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.‚Äù 2 Sam. xxiii. 4. I The morning star is burning in the sky, The dawn is grey above the eastern hill; The guilty city lieth calm and still As sleeping innocence; while passeth by The Magdalene, with sad though lustrous eye, Bearing a vase with spice and ointment sweet, Prepared to render burial honours meet For Him who deigned upon the cross to die. Soon shall arise the light of cloudless morn; The tender grass is waiting to be born Through the clear shining after summer rain. No longer flows the fountain of her tears, And in her eyes a fearful hope appears That Jesus has not lived and died in vain. II And thus I read her musings: ‚ÄúWe were fain,‚Äù She says within herself, ‚Äúto trust that He Was the Deliverer, born to make us free, And on His father David's throne to reign:‚Äî And He has died in shame and bitter pain! Died with the vilest!‚ÄîHe who raised the dead‚Äî He before whom the spirits of darkness fled! And where of all His life is now the gain? 'Tis here at least;‚Äîthough all on earth seem loss, And though the Lord has died upon a cross, The powers of hell confess His victory; The demons that from me His word expelled Return not, by His deathless might withheld:‚Äî Himself He saved not, yet He saveth me!‚Äù CHRIST IN HEAVEN. (See Rev. i. 18, and Ps. lxxvii. 16, 20.) Thou who wast dead and livest evermore, And hast the keys of Hades and of death; Who givest and who takest life and breath;‚Äî O Thou who standest on the eternal shore, Beyond the flow of time, beyond the roar Of change and toil and tumult!‚ÄîLord, we know The heart of love that dwelt in Thee below Still dwells in Thee, whom Seraphim adore. And though Thy ways are in the mighty deep, And though Thy footsteps are by paths unknown, Thou wilt Thine earthly flock in safety keep, And lead and guard and guide it for Thine own; Thou, Heavenly King, art Shepherd of the sheep, And Thou wilt gather all around Thy throne. CHRISTMAS IN ARMAGH CATHEDRAL. With angels and archangels, and with all The host of Heaven, we magnify Thy Name Of Saviour, from the highest Heaven who came To be the Virgin's Son! whom seraphs call Thrice-Holy, God Almighty!‚ÄîLet the same Be echoed in Thy churches here below, With organ music like the cataract's flow, And hovering voices like the rainbow's flame Above the cataract! And when silence falls, May all that kneel within these sacred walls Feel on their hearts Thy blessing fall like dew. And let us bear away, when we depart, Music of Heaven embalmed in every heart! For Thou art mighty all things to renew. ON THE RIVIERA. This poem has been suggested by an incident which the writer witnessed at Villafranca Bay, near Nice. The charcoal was on the ground, and the fish on the charcoal, without anything between. I Under an aged olive, by the sea, I saw a charcoal fire, and fish, and bread, For there a fisher crew their meal had spread; And as I saw, my thoughts to Galilee Were borne, and to the lake with waters free Rippling upon the beach where Jesus said To one who vowed his love, but turned and fled, And then denied his Saviour, Lov'st thou Me? I could not speak, but silent tears made dim Mine eyes, to think how faint my love to Him; For, though I serve Him from my early years, And would not hide one secret from His sight, My path is but a darkness crossed with light, And Heaven most like a clouded heaven appears. II And so it was with the disciples there. They knew that He who died was raised again, But spread the net once more, their food to gain, Knowing not yet how great their blessings were. A night of fruitless toil and half-despair Passed wearily, until the morning came; But when the East was bright with sunrise-flame, The Saviour spake before they were aware. For Christ can hear His people ere they pray. And unto me He spake, that summer day, Under the olives, on Liguria's shore. And, though I made no answer, He will stay. He follows me and finds me when I stray, And leads me back to bless Him and adore. III The pure in heart shall see Thee and be blest. But am I pure? I know not, but I know It is Thy will, my God, that I should grow To purity like Thine; and I can rest Rejoicing, when I think that in my breast There's not a thought or wish but long ago, Before the stream of time began to flow, In Thine eternal foresight was possessed. Naked and open lay my heart to Thee Before Thy hand in secret fashioned me; Therefore, I pray Thee, search and try my heart, And lead me in the everlasting way, And cleanse me from my sin against the day When I shall see Thee, Saviour! as Thou art. SISTER DORA. ‚ÄúBlessed is the man whose strength is in Thee; In whose heart are the highways to Zion. Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings. They go from strength to strength, Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.‚Äù Ps. lxxxiv. 5-7, Revised Version. O strong and blest, who makest God thy choice, And bearest in thy heart thy Saviour's ways, Bidding the vale of misery to rejoice With showers of blessing on its wintry days! Thy life of labour is a life of praise; Thy toil is prayer, thy rest thanksgiving. Go Onward, from strength to strength increasing; so Thy God will guide thee through the thorniest maze Of earthly life, and make all service sweet, Even to bind the wounds and wash the feet Alike of sinner and of saint. Go on And follow in the path thy Saviour trod, Till thou in Zion stand before thy God, And hear thy Father's blessing, ‚ÄúChild, well done.‚Äù GRACE FOR GRACE. ‚ÄúOf His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.‚Äù John i. 16. ‚ÄúLove the gift is love the debt.‚Äù Tennyson. Love may bestow itself, but not withdraw; The gift of love, bestowed, becomes a debt. Thus Love and Duty in the ring are set Of holy Marriage, gems without a flaw; And thus it is that Grace is one with Law In regions higher and more holy still‚Äî In His divinely human heart and will Whose heavenly glory the apostles saw. Not for our merit‚Äîmerit we have none‚Äî We claim the love of God's eternal Son, And hope to see the brightness of His face; For its own sake His love itself bestows, And out of God's eternal fulness flows, And for His grace gives ever fuller grace. INFANCY. A forest in an acorn lies asleep, And sunrise waits below the morning star To flood with spreading light the world afar; All wisdom in an infant's mind lies deep Buried and hid, till He Whose angels keep Charge of the little ones, shall touch and wake His child to knowledge, life, and power;‚Äîshall make The seed a fruit for husbandmen to reap. But what the seed is to the full-grown tree, Or what the child is to the perfect man, The same is man to what he yet shall be When Heaven matures the Almighty Father's plan; His roots are in the past eternity, His fruit the eternity to come shall see. MORTALITY. We live within a prison, which we call Mortality. Its massive walls and roof Against the eternal light of Heaven are proof. In utter darkness it enclosed us all, Till One arose, our hopes to disenthral; The Son of God and man, who broke a way Up through the roof to Heaven; and thence a ray Does ever since upon the darkness fall. And they who see it wait in hope the day When, at the sounding of the trump of might, The roof and walls shall vanish all away That hide the heavenly glories from our sight;‚Äî When life shall fling aside its bonds of clay, And darkness shall be swallowed up of light. PHILOSOPHY. Not long ago I thought, my dearest friend, Like you, that all philosophy was vain, And barren as the desert's pathless plain Whose wastes of sand round Tadmor's fanes extend, And, like the ocean, in the distance blend With Heaven. But on my soul I felt a spell Of strong magnetic virtue, to compel My thoughts toward mightiest mysteries still to bend. Then found I knowledge that I had not sought, Like one who roams, the desert to explore, And, when such dreams are farthest from his thought, Finds suddenly a vein of precious ore, And thanks the Power that led him to the spot, And gathers eagerly the golden store. ON READING HERBERT SPENCER'S ‚ÄúPSYCHOLOGY.‚Äù I thank thee, sage and seer, that thou hast brought The widely wandering intellect of man Back to where first its childhood's walks began; Where the reality we long have sought Through clouds and mists and vapours phantom-fraught Is found upon the firm familiar earth, Where flowers are bright and children make their mirth, And mines of knowledge ask but to be wrought. Again we see ‚Äúthe light of common day‚Äù As when it shone upon our childish way, Before our souls to wander had been taught. We see the truths that are most widely true, Old as the ages, as the morning new, Revealed in things and imaged back in thought. CROMWELL. A gallant ship, upon a stormy tide Onward and upward borne rejoicingly, Beyond the common bounds of land and sea; Then, when the waters ebb, upon the side Of ocean left, a stranded wreck, to glide No more where breezes sweep and billows roll:‚Äî Behold a type of the sublimest soul That has in England reigned since Alfred died. His visioned hopes, his stormy ardour, bore Him onward, upward, to a perilous shore, Then left him desolate in kingly pride. The dream of glory and the sense of power That raised the warrior's soul in battle's hour Were to the lonely despot's heart denied. ON THE COMPLETION OF COLOGNE CATHEDRAL. See Wordsworth's sonnet beginning‚Äî ‚ÄúOh for the help of angels to complete This temple!‚Äù No need for ‚Äúhelp of angels to complete This temple!‚Äù it was better far that man, While centuries passed, should gaze upon its plan Unfinished and abandoned;‚Äîthen 'twas meet The German nation, in the ‚Äúaspiring heat‚Äù Of its returning life, the work should end; That from the finished Minster might ascend The prayer of human faith, with praises sweet. It stands no longer like a broken vow; The spires are crowned, the sculpture perfect now, Keeping the mighty promise of the past. Oh may this glorious Church a symbol stand Of German loyalty to fatherland, And faith in God, while earthly ages last! WORDSWORTH. I dreamed I was a poet once; but all Nature's most mighty spells of sound and sight Fell on my heart like softest notes that fall, And, dying, only wake a dumb delight; And now the charm of all that's dear and bright- The ‚Äúglory of the grass‚Äù in sparkling showers, The breath of spring-time in the woodland bowers, The grandeur of a snowy mountain height, The starry splendour of the heavenly powers, The light of sunset on a sleeping sea, The loveliness of bright-eyed mountain flowers, The music of the skylark and the bee, The mirth of children in the summer hours‚Äî I leave to Wordsworth to express for me. VIRGIL. ‚ÄúFelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas, Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.‚Äù ‚ÄúSunt lacrym√¶ rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt‚Äù Virgil. ‚ÄúHappy were he who could attain to know Causes of things, and underneath his feet Set fear and fate, and the unreturning flow Of all-devouring Acheron.‚Äù Oh! unmeet Such tearless Stoic calm for thee, the sweet Half-Christian poet of the Pagan age, Whom later times esteemed a wizard sage And Dante as his guide rejoiced to greet; Tender as woman, and as childhood pure! Not thoughts like those shall in his mind endure Who learns aright the lore thy genius brings; But human sympathy for human woe; And words of thine which tell that ‚Äútears must flow, And hearts of men are touched by mortal things.‚Äù THE ARABIAN NIGHTS. In childhood, when the days and years seemed long, And life a wonderland, I thought that men Were men indeed. But I have lived since then; And being now a man among the throng Of other men, I see that I was wrong. I find that we are truly children yet; And hours of sickness or of deep regret; Mornings of summer, with the skylark's song; And tales like these‚Äîwild wondrous tales of yore, Which to the child's play of the world belong‚Äî Can bring to grave and care-worn men once more The thoughts of childhood, with conviction strong That even though manliness be folded o'er Our bosoms, we are children at the core. MIST. I can rejoice that I have not been born In southern climes, where heavens are deep and clear; Where stars are brighter, and the hues of morn And sunset shine with richer glow than here; Where spring meets autumn in the circling year; Where myrtles flower, and palm-trees wave on high; For, had I lived in such an atmosphere, The solemn glories of a northern sky Would bring to me not joy, but gloom and dread;‚Äî The veils of rainy mist that magnify The mighty hills and glaciers round me spread; While in the clouds is lost the mountain's head, And every hollow to the baffled eye Seems like a sea's unfathomable bed. GROWING OLD. ‚ÄúHast thou come with the heart of thy childhood back?‚Äù Mrs. Hemans. Do I retain my childhood's heart? you ask. No, but far better! I have put away The childish things and schoolboy's slavish task, That filled the opening hours of life's long day; And whether smooth or thorny be the way Of life, which I so many years have trod, I find it lightened by a heavenly ray‚Äî I find it lead to freedom and to God. And He will bear me safely through the wild, Whatever joy or sorrow He may send; All is in kindness sent; and reconciled, And not a stranger, I shall wait the end; Of God no more a servant, but a child; Of Christ no more a servant, but a friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS IN THE STANZA OF ‚ÄúIN MEMORIAM.‚Äù BELFAST LOUGH. I sailed at morning down the bay, 'Mid scenes familiar to my sight. The sky was neither dark nor bright, And mist upon the water lay; And somewhat dimly, through the mist, The mountains rose; no light and shade Upon their sides in beauty played; No floating clouds their summits kissed. Wide were the waters round me spread; They slumbered not in heavenly blue, Nor rolled in waves of emerald hue, But almost had the tint of lead. No billows dashed upon the shore, Nor whitened o'er the open seas; There was no freshness in the breeze; Sea, earth, and sky no gladness wore. It was my home, the scene around, Though not in light and smiles arrayed; It seemed a place for labour made, Where pleasure hardly might be found. Again I sailed, at evening, back. The mountains wore a purple gloom, And strangely did the sun illume With level rays the vessel's track; For where the mountain ridge is low The sun was sinking to his rest; And all the spaces of the West Were filled with opal-tinted glow; And down upon the waters wide A flood of fiery radiance came, A column made of wavy flame, And rippled in the rippling tide. Where fronts the hill the setting sun, The windows of the village turned To ruddy fire; awhile they burned, Then ceased, like tapers, one by one. The mist was changed to doubtful light; The mountains of the western shore Were farther, larger, than before; And scattered sails were gleaming white. It was my home, the scene around, Though not in home-like light arrayed It seemed a place for visions made, Enchanted sea, and fairy ground. And, as I gazed upon the change, I thought;‚ÄîThe second world, foretold By many a sage and seer of old, May not itself be new or strange; Only another light may shine Than that which rules our earthly days; For we shall dwell beneath the rays Of Light Eternal and Divine. ‚ÄúNO MORE SEA.‚Äù (See Rev. xxi. 1.) The holy seer of Patmos told Of visions of a world to be, Eternal, calm, and where the sea Shall round the earth no more be rolled. And I, to whom the waves' long roar Has ever been a sound of joy; Who loved the ocean when a boy, And now, in manhood, love it more;‚Äî I wondered long what this might mean, If, in that second world sublime, 'Mid all the garnered wealth of time, The ocean shall no more be seen; Till flashed this meaning on my thought;‚Äî The mystery, awful and profound, That shuts our narrow being round, Whereto at last our life is brought; This mighty mystery shall be known, This ocean turned to solid land, Whereon the sons of God shall stand, And build, and use it as their own. A THOUGHT OF STOICISM. I have ere now been half inclined To wish the present life were all; That death upon the soul might fall, And darkness overwhelm the mind. Not that I envied then the beast Which never thinks of good or ill, And only cares to eat his fill At mighty Nature's bounteous feast; But that our motives might be pure, And free our choice and clear our way, The law of conscience to obey, Whether to act or to endure; To fight with sin, without regard To conquests in the battle won; To say at last, ‚ÄúMy work is done; I die, and seek for no reward.‚Äù And yet I know 'tis better far That faith should look beyond the grave On Him Who died, the world to save, And rose to be the Polar Star, For ever, of our hope and love; To guide us on through death and night, To realms of deathless life and light, To mansions of the blest above. I know 'tis well to trust the Power Who makes the buried seeds to bloom, That He will raise me from the tomb, As summer's breath awakes a flower; To take a child upon my knee, Or lay what was my friend in dust, And feel a reverential trust That He Who made them both to be,‚Äî Who gives us death as well as birth, And maketh children grow to men,‚Äî Will give us other life again, More blessed than the life on earth. THEORY AND LIFE. ‚ÄúGrau, theuerer Freund, ist alle Theorie, Und gr√ºn des Lebens goldner Baum.‚Äù Goethe. With petty care and grief o'erfraught, I had been more than half inclined To wish that I could turn my mind Into a mere machine of thought. But on my knee I took a child, And pressed the soft warm lips to mine, And saw the little features shine With life and pleasure as it smiled. Then came to mind what Goethe said: ‚ÄúAll theory is sere and cold, But life is green, with flowers of gold;‚Äù And that unholy wish was fled. PILGRIMAGE. (See Ps. xxiii.) ‚ÄúThe Lord, my Shepherd, will provide For all my wants; He makes me rest Upon the mountain's grassy breast, Or by the quiet water's side.‚Äù Well said, thou true and thankful heart! And yet not all can breathe Amen; For some must roam the desert, when The downward sunbeams fiercely dart; Must wander in a burning land, Where shade and verdure are unknown; Where nought is seen but bare grey stone, And long brown tracts of weary sand. Yet even there the Lord can spread A table in the midst of foes; Out of the rock the fountain flows, And from the heavens descendeth bread. And faith can see a vision shine Of homes of everlasting rest, Where God will make His people blest, In vine-clad vales of Palestine. WORKING AND WAITING. ‚ÄúThey also serve who only stand and wait.‚Äù Milton. Father! I know, unless Thou build, The builder's toil is gone for nought. Thy presence therefore have I sought, That Thy design may be fulfilled In me and in my work. To bend Thy holy will by prayer to mine, I do not ask; but make me Thine, O Thou Who art my being's end! Grant me a patient heart to keep, Faithful alike through praise and blame, In victory and defeat the same, And whether I rejoice or weep; And if Thou wilt, oh grant me this, That I, Thy child, may ever be A fellow-labourer with Thee, And minister to others' bliss; But if the purpose should be Thine, That I must only ‚Äústand and wait‚Äù With myriad others at Thy gate, O Father! let me not repine. So may Thy will through mine be done, Working or waiting, to the last; And may I see, when death is past, The face of Thine eternal Son!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. JOHN STUART MILL. [I have to thank Messrs. Macmillan and Co. for their kind permission to republish this poem, which originally appeared in Macmillan's Magazine. The first stanza of the original publication has been replaced by a new one, and the lines entitled ‚ÄúAfterthought‚Äù are also new.] Would to our God thou hadst been ours! We need you all, ye faithful few Who consecrate to truth your powers, And love it but for being true! I call thee happy; thou wast strong In age with all the strength of youth; With zeal for freedom, hate of wrong, Reverence for man, and love of truth; And thou didst read, as in a scroll, The laws of nature and of mind. But wherefore is it, that thy soul To higher things than these was blind? The world thy intellect descried Was coloured with no heavenly glow; Thy thought, a dwelling fair and wide, Was lighted only from below. And yet, if God is Light indeed, Then surely, whether clear or dim Our knowledge, all its rays proceed‚Äî Though they be broken rays‚Äîfrom Him. And He, I know, will guide thee right. The pure to Him shall see their way; The just shall tread a path of light, Increasing to the perfect day; And thou art such as these; and He Who healed the blind, will touch thine eyes To see the God thou didst not see, The Christ thou didst not recognize; And that which seemed a Stygian shore Will prove a land of knowledge, grown From earthly germs yet more and more, Till thou shalt know as thou art known. AFTERTHOUGHT. Yet, when that second world is won, And thou, in uncreated Light, Hast learned how God's eternal Son Guides all His universe aright, Wilt not thou feel an underflow, Beneath the joy, of chill regret, To think that here thou didst not know The Saviour thou at last hast met? A ROSE TRANSPLANTED. ‚ÄúRose, elle a v√©cu ce que vivent les roses, L'espace d'un matin.‚Äù ‚ÄúA rose, she has lived the lifetime of a rose, One morning's space.‚Äù O God, is this our last farewell to those Whom death's embrace Has borne away in silence? If a Rose In earthly air such beauty can unclose, Sweetness, and grace, Oh what must be her glory when she grows Planted where uncreated radiance glows, And watered by the stream of life that flows Before Thy face! FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL. Death has not overtaken thee, Although thy voice no more is heard. Thy lovely spirit, soaring free And ever singing, like the bird That mounts in song the azure height, Has vanished into heavenly light. See her ‚ÄúMemorials‚Äù (Nisbet and Co.), p. 308. But I, who toil and cannot soar; Who have not skill to speak; whose thought Demands the written page, before It can attain the form it sought; Nor can, like thine, with music aid The charm by words but half conveyed; Whose soul is but as earth to fire, Or night to morn, compared to thine; Why do I feel such strong desire In that high world of light divine The music of thy voice to hear, Which never charmed on earth my ear? Thou couldst have been to me, I feel, A sister and a friend, with voice The discords of my life to heal, And teach my spirit to rejoice. And I to thee might well have taught Lessons with equal blessings fraught; I would have taught thee to refrain Thy thoughts' and words' too eager flow; In perfectness to guide thy strain Of holy poetry; to know How ‚Äútasks in hours of insight willed May be through hours of gloom fulfilled.‚Äù Matthew Arnold. Thy works were but thy smallest part, Mere casual sparks that glanced and glowed; Thou shouldst have mused, and kept thy heart Burning in silence, till it flowed Into a mould of verse sublime, Meet to endure through agelong time. Through time!‚Äîbut what is time to those For whom eternity is won? Thou dwellest in the bright repose That has no need of moon or sun, Where all have light to know their own, For all shall know as they are known. There, in the light of endless days, A brother thou shalt find in me; And all the rivers of our praise Shall flow into the crystal sea, From voices raised apart on earth, But mingled in the second birth. MARGUERITE. See Matthew Arnold's ‚ÄúSwitzerland‚Äù poems, especially ‚ÄúThe Terrace at Berne.‚Äù Canst thou recall thy Marguerite so, With tearless eye and tranquil breath, Nor seek, nor greatly care, to know Which may now hold her, life or death? Would it were death! ‚Äúthe dead are well;‚Äù The tears dry soon above a grave. But is she in an earthly hell? And couldst not thou have tried to save? But if her destiny to control Who charmed thy youth was past thy power, Thou shouldst not mourn a ruined soul Thus lightly, like a withered flower! And has the stream of change and chance Borne aught more precious yet to thee Than her, thy blue-eyed flower of France, Thy pearl of Leman's Alpine sea? ‚ÄúSweetness and light‚Äù‚Äîare these thy aim? She taught thy spirit to be sweet. Pause at the thought, and let it claim A bitter tear for Marguerite. And light‚Äîthe holy light of truth? She was no star, thy course to guide; But in the darkness of thy youth We saw thee clinging to her side. But darkness now for thee is past, Forgotten with the vanished years. Sweetness and light are thine at last, And thou hast done with doubts and fears. Sweetness, to charm away their woes Who breathe hard breath, eat bitter bread; Light, to become the life of those Who dwell in darkness, like the dead. But whence thy sweetness? whence thy light? Are they of Him whom sinners slew, Who rose in God the Father's might, And hailed the woman whom He knew? No, these thou deemest old-world tales; Things that in waking dreams have been. To save thy Marguerite, nought avails The Christ who saved the Magdalene. These symbolize thy creed alone;‚Äî A vacant cross, a sealed-up tomb; An angel leaving fast the stone, A light that makes more dense the gloom; And in the gloom a form is seen, Kneeling, but at no Saviour's feet. Is it the sorrowing Magdalene? Is it thy once-loved Marguerite? THE MYSTERY AND THE GLORY. He that ascends to Etna's highest height, With nought around but rocks and fire and snow, Shall see the stars more numerous and more bright, While the blue depths of heaven still deeper grow. They seem no nearer to the straining sight Than when he gazed upon them from below; But far more glorious in their light they shine, And speak more clearly of the Power Divine. And so it is with those the height who climb Of highest human knowledge; for the rays Of the eternal glory most sublime Seem to the eyes which from that summit gaze; But all the mightiest mysteries of Time, Existence, Freedom, Fate, that height displays Not solved but deepened‚Äîan abyss of sky Deepening and darkening as we mount on high. COMMUNION WITH THE DEAD. Suggested by a letter of Mrs. Beecher Stowe (see her ‚ÄúMemoirs,‚Äù p. 486). ‚ÄúHow do they rest, the holy dead Departed in the faith and fear Of Him, their Saviour, who has led Their spirits to the heavenly sphere? ‚ÄúOn them no evil may alight; No thirst, nor hunger, fear, nor pain, Nor withering heat, nor frosty blight, Shall ever visit them again. ‚ÄúBut, where they rest in calm Divine, Does silence take the place of speech? No interchange of word or sign Across the gulf of death may reach; ‚ÄúAnd do they wait in sleep profound Of agelong rest from earthly strife, Until they hear the trumpet sound That wakes anew the dead to life; ‚ÄòOr do they feel for human woes, And frown in wrath on human sin, And watch and bless the strife of those Who strive a heavenly crown to win? ‚ÄúWe know not. Would to God we knew! What blessing on our life were shed, Could we but pierce the shadows through, And hold communion with the dead!‚Äù Thus did I ponder, till I read Words from beyond the western sea, Echoing my yearning to the dead, And giving answer back to me:‚Äî ‚ÄúWe know the dead through Christ alone‚Äî The Lord who vanquished death of old. With Him, through all the dread unknown, Our spirits may communion hold; ‚ÄúAnd whether the departed wake In light, or sleep in shadow dim, God loves them for the Saviour's sake, And they are bound to us through Him. ‚ÄúThrough Him from highest Heaven who came, Whose human tears for Lazarus flowed, Who bore the cross, endured the shame, And died, and lay in death's abode; ‚ÄúThrough Him who wields the Almighty's powers, The Firstborn, and the Church's Head, Through Him alone, their Lord and ours, We hold communion with the dead.‚Äù A SUGGESTION FOR A PAINTER. Paint us two pictures, which may represent The sorrows and the hopes of humankind. The first, our father Adam's banishment From Eden, where the angel-guard behind, And flaming sword on high, all access bar To where the trees of life and knowledge are; And Eve turns back to weep, and gaze once more On her lost home; but Adam lifts his eye, Serene, though sad, the regions to explore Of that vast world where he must toil and die; And Satan, like a serpent coiled, is near, Exulting in a triumph mixed with fear. And let the other show the Lord ascending Up to the heavens to meet His Father's love. Below, His faithful followers attending, The cloud of light awaiting Him above; The cross, the grave, the stone rolled back, and lying Below them all, the serpent crushed and dying. FIRST SORROW. [Suggested by ‚ÄúGolden Hours‚Äù in ‚ÄúLoving Thoughts for Lonely Hours,‚Äù by M. G.] The days of childhood‚Äîwere they golden? We see them through a golden haze Of memory; but, when near beholden, Were they indeed such golden days? No, not of gold those early hours, Although their passing pleased us well. They were but lovely vernal flowers, Fading and withering ere they fell. But when our earliest grief was blended With trembling faith, our hearts to melt; When childhood's careless joys were ended, And life's reality was felt; When first we cried to God alone;‚Äî That was indeed the golden hour! Then seed of heavenly life was sown In weakness, to be raised in power. The richest store of heavenly gain May spring from deepest earthly loss. The holiest joy has roots in pain‚Äî Eternal glory in the Cross. THE PEACE OF CHRIST. (See John xiv. 27, and Isa. xlviii. 18.) ‚ÄúI leave with thee My peace; Not as the world might give, I give to thee. It is a fount whose stream shall never cease, But widen to a sea.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, my Redeemer! no!‚Äù Thus in my restless youth I made reply; ‚ÄúThe streams of heavenly peace can never flow For me, before I die. ‚ÄúLove I can understand, Although it passeth knowledge; and Thy power I can exult in. Saviour, from Thy hand I seek that twofold dower: ‚ÄúLet love and strength be mine; And joy I can imagine, full and free; And knowledge of Thy will and Thy design; But peace is not for me. ‚ÄúOur earthly life and breath Are spent in deep unrest and hurrying haste; A draught of peace would seem a draught of death; I should not know the taste.‚Äù Thus once I made reply, And to the blast I turned my aching breast. But when the storm was threatening yet more high, I found unsought-for rest. The cloud that was so dark Burst not in tempest, but in calming rain, Which stilled the waves that surged around my bark; And now, though clouds remain, And youthful joy is fled, I feel the calm that follows on the strife; And, by the star of Christ in safety led, I find that peace is life. WAITING FOR CHRIST. The Kingdom of God is within us. God knoweth, it is not without; The world without is a world of conflict, and sorrow, and sin, Which darken its brightest joys with a cloud of misgiving and doubt; But thanks be to Thee, our God, who hast set Thy Kingdom within; For there Thy children in patience and hope shall ever be found, Faithful even to death, a crown of life to gain; Forming a circle of light in the midst of the gloom around, A sphere of peace and joy in the midst of the strife and pain. But is it so, O God? is Thy Kingdom indeed within? Is Thy Kingdom indeed among us, on earth? for since the hour When the Saviour returned to heaven, it seems that the care and the sin And the sorrow of earth combine, Thy Kingdom to overpower. And often our courage sinks, and our prayers seem unavailing, And our faith and hope burn low like a lamp with oil unfed; And the hands of those who fight the fight of faith are failing, And many on sleep are fallen‚Äîare they asleep or dead? Folly! thus to mistrust the Saviour who, dying, won us; Slowness of heart! to doubt all that the prophets have said. The glory of Christ shall shine from heaven and rest upon us; Awaken, thou who sleepest, and arise, thou who art dead! And what if the night be dark? and what if our sight be dim? If we be weary, shall time pause in its onward flow? Christ will remember the world though the world forgetteth Him; And while the sower sleepeth, the corn-blades spring and grow. Like a sightless child that sits and plays on his father's knee, Like a weary child that leans and sleeps on his mother's breast, We yield and trust ourselves to a God that we cannot see, And wait, if not in joy, yet in thankfulness and rest; In the quiet confidence that can trust our God for all; Though the fig-tree bear no fruit, nor grapes grow ripe on the vine, Though the flock be cut off from the fold, and no herd be found in the stall, And the barley fail, and the wheat.‚ÄîBut guard the oil and the wine! See Rev. vi. 6. Guard the wine of Christ, which is His life, outpoured For the saving of the world, for the life and health of men; Guard the oil of the Spirit, which Christ has left to us, stored To keep our lamps alight till the Bridegroom come again. Yea, in the Lord our God we will evermore rejoice; Knowing the Kingdom within shall be at last revealed, When the Lord shall return in the clouds of heaven with the trumpet's voice, And shine as a Sun on those who no longer need a Shield. Then every foe shall be crushed like a vessel made of clay, Every idol shall bow, and into fragments fall; Pain and sorrow and sighing shall flee for ever away, And death shall be destroyed, and God shall be all in all. THE END OF THE JUST. When worthy life its end has met, And goodness back to Heaven is gone, Oh say not that a star is set, But say, a star is lost in dawn. SUMMER. How glorious are the summer days When heaven is clear and air is calm! Earth basks beneath the noontide blaze, And every breath is balm. And how delightful, underneath Some tree's dense foliage to repose, And feel the summer's fragrant breath As through the boughs it blows; Or from the glare too hot and bright To hide beneath some bowered arcade, And bathe the eyes in soft green light Mingled with mellow shade; To watch the play of light and dark Among the clustered leaves on high, And sometimes, through the foliage, mark The azure of the sky! And when the sultry atmosphere Cools at the welcome dawn of even, And dark blue hills are pictured clear Against a sunset heaven, How sweet to watch while stars have birth, With twilight calm our souls to fill, And feel the evening shades o'er earth Grow yet more dim and still; While all is vague as in a dream; And roses pale and lilies white Against the foliage faintly gleam, Like phosphorescent light. Oh, glorious are the evenings fair That end the sultry summer days; 'Tis pleasant but to breathe the air, And joyful but to gaze. A VISION OF THE PRESENT. I dreamed I lived in ages long ago‚Äî The time I recollect not, nor the place‚Äî Among a people in whose veins did flow Blood of the heaven-besieging Titan race, Though human were their mothers: in the glow Of their bright eyes I could discern the trace Of their high ancestry and glorious dower Of magic knowledge and gigantic power. The elements to vassalage they brought, And made them toil as slaves, by ceaseless war; Even fire himself, with daring hands, they caught And tamed, and yoked him to the flying car; The lightning's flash with line and bait they sought, And, like the genie in the copper jar, They held it under bolts and bars restrained, Or, when they pleased, its violence unchained. They weighed the Sun against the Moon; they cast The plummet into heaven's abyss profound, Sounding its depths; the fleetness of the blast They measured, and the speed of light and sound; They searched through plains and mountains, and at last Creation's history graved in rock they found, And learned to read the wondrous tales it told Of monstrous forms that haunted earth of old. They built a magic chamber, wherein all That ever did before its window stand, Unerringly upon the enchanted wall Was painted by a spirit's viewless hand. And ships they had that calms could ne'er enthral, That still obeyed the mariner's command, And, by an innate power of life, defied The adverse struggling force of wind and tide. And slaves they had with arms of iron made, Strong as a thousand men, who tireless bore The heaviest loads, and toiled at every trade: Some blew the forge, some drew to light the ore, Some ploughed, some spun and wove; one, with a head Of steel and brass, could calculate far more From sunrise to the fall of eve, than man Could calculate in half a lifetime's span. And heralds these magicians had, that spoke With voice of lightning and magnetic tongue Across the world. At last my slumber broke‚Äî I think it was a railway bell that rung. Before me rose a steamboat's cloud of smoke, A telegraphic wire above me hung; And, starting from my wonder-dream, I found All I had fancied, in the world around. WESTMINSTER ABBEY. (See John iv. 36, 38.) Through twilight aisles and arches flows A flood of rich and solemn sound. Here England's mightiest men repose, Here England's kings are crowned. Oh, who can say death levels all? Death sets the great of earth sublime Each on his own just pedestal, A landmark of the time. And clearer, purer, seems their fame Out of the silent past to glow, Than when the people mixed their name With daily joy and woe. It is because we thus revere The mighty dead, the glorious past, We hope that many a future year May reap the seed they cast Into the earth, which often gives Back what we thought for ever gone. A thousand years‚Äîand Alfred lives Again, in Washington. Through slow and silent length of time The rain and sunshine of the sky Nourish the cedar to its prime, And spread its boughs on high. And thus did our forefathers build; Year following year, stone following stone. The founder's purpose was fulfilled By labour not his own. The father left the walls begun; His child, obeying his desire, Still at the sacred work went on; His grandson crowned the spire. They toiled like faithful men and true, Whose works on earth deserve to last; Men of a reverent heart, that knew How deeply in the past The living present has its root; And in the future age must bear Such wholesome or such deadly fruit As best rewards our care. That which we reap we have not sown, And what we sow we shall not reap, Nor watch it till its fruit is grown; It groweth while we sleep. Yet what would all that's here be worth, And wherefore all our toil and strife, Were graves our final homes on earth, And death the end of life; If God our Father did not keep A mansion in the heavenly dome, Where all that sow and all that reap Shall join in harvest home? THE YEWS OF BORROWDALE. Written in 1855. I stood beneath the yews of Borrowdale, Renowned in Wordsworth's poem. Fifty years Have added fifty circles to the grain Of younger trees, since Wordsworth wrote those lines: But these are what they were when he described Their gloomy shade and wild contorted boughs. To Grasmere's churchyard then my thoughts returned, Where Wordsworth waits the rising of the dead. For there four yews were planted by his hand, And shadow now his low but honoured grave. Young are they yet, and slender; but a time May be, long after these of Borrowdale Into their parent dust have mouldered back, When those of Grasmere, too, shall in their turn Be gnarled with age, and verging to decay; When men shall come to visit Wordsworth's grave, Speaking our language, but from distant lands Where the magnolia blossoms, and from heights Of Himalaya, clothed with deodars; And spell the lichen-stained and time-worn name Upon the stone that marks his place of rest; And muse beneath the yew-trees' twilight shade, Beside the Rotha's clear and quiet pools, With thoughts too deep for pleasure; then survey With more than common love and thankfulness, The lakes and streams and mountains Wordsworth loved, And call the place their spirits' fatherland. PYGMALION. The sculptor's task is ended: He casts his tools aside, To gaze upon his perfect work In all an artist's pride. For many a year his spirit, In visioned solitude, O'er bright creations of his brain Would, like a lover, brood; For many a year he laboured To give his haunting thought Of pure ideal loveliness, A form in sculpture wrought; And now it smiles upon him, Serene in marble rest; Lovelier than aught of earth‚Äîa shape For islands of the blest. And he, who never sighed for Nor wooed a living maid, But pondered on unreal charms In heavenly light arrayed, Gazing on this creation Of his own raptured mind, Where every charm of form and soul Appears in one combined‚Äî The purity of childhood, A flower's soft bending grace, The glory of a muse inspired, A dovelike gentleness, A sibyl's holy grandeur‚Äî All mingling in the gleam Of vague delight that overcomes A maid in love's first dream, Now feels his bosom burning With all-unwonted fires, And to the Powers that rule in Heaven His soul in prayer aspires;‚Äî ‚ÄúOh, hear me, ye immortals Enthroned above, if e'er Your steadfast counsels may be moved By human wish or prayer! ‚ÄúOh, breathe a living spirit Into the ice-cold stone; Grant it a human voice and heart To answer to my own!‚Äù And at his prayer the marble Begins with life to glow: The cheeks, like rose-leaves, gently blush; The locks turn dark, and flow In waves of raven blackness Like clouds of lingering night, O'ershadowing a forehead fair And clear as morning's light; And large dark eyes, as brilliant And pure as starry rays, Reveal a living woman's soul To his enraptured gaze. Sunlike, she shines upon him With radiant smiling face, And gives him back the kiss of love, And answers his embrace. Their hearts together beating With joy and love and pride, She from her pedestal descends, To be the sculptor's bride. THORWALDSEN'S LAST WORK. It is said that Thorwaldsen, on finishing his last work, wept because he could see no fault in it. In flawless, faultless perfection the statue before me stands; Is this your cause of rejoicing? I turn aside in tears, To think, in this last and most laboured work of my brain and my hands, No sign of error, no trace of imperfection, appears. Small things only are perfect‚Äîthe pearl and the heather-flower, And the insect that passes away when its life is well begun. The dewdrop is perfect and pure in the light of the morning hour, But spots of darkness darken the face of the moon and the sun. Greatness is imperfection. In toil and in strife our powers Are nourished;‚Äîthe strife that matures is one with the hindrance that mars. Whether is greater, the child that laughs as he plays among flowers, Or the man that sighs as he turns a furrowed brow to the stars? All that is noble aspires. To the heavens aspires the tree, And the river's volume swells till it loses itself in the deep. Aspiration and growth‚Äîthese have been life to me; Level perfection is death; I bow the head and weep. Or is it that I am blind, and see no more the faults Which with my finished work have ever been wont to blend? I know not; I only know that my genius creeps and halts; I have gained the height of the pass, and my path must now descend. And yet I thank my God that not in vain I have lived. I have seized and used and adorned the hours as they passed me by; I have learned, I have toiled, I have striven; exulted, despaired, and achieved; Now take me home, O Father! I feel it is time to die. IMMORTAL LOVE. Marriage, though holy, is for earth; But Love, matured on earth, remains To those who, in the second birth, Rise free from earthly stains. Beyond the rocks and shoals of Time, The shoreless and unfathomed sea Extends, unchangeably sublime, Of God's Eternity; And far beyond our mortal gaze Extends, and high as Heaven above Life's drifting clouds and fleeting haze, Unchanged, immortal Love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CLASSICAL AND BIBLICAL STUDIES. THE CONSECRATION OF THE PARTHENON. ‚ÄúTime is a child at play.‚Äù Heraclitus. The Parthenon, Athena's pride and crown, Was finished; every hammer's sound was hushed, The marble's splintery dust was cleared away, And all was ready for the joyful rite Of consecration; when, before the crowd Began to gather, an Athenian came Whose intellect was nurtured in the schools Of ancient song and high philosophy; He came for one long satisfying gaze Upon the perfect work; and, as he mused, His thoughts found words, and with himself he spake: ‚ÄúWhat toil of slaves has built these walls! What wealth of dimly burning gold, And lustrous marble, pure and cold, Is gathered in these sacred halls! ‚ÄúBut far more precious than the hand Of slave, is that high intellect Which gave the free-souled architect O'er matter his sublime command; ‚ÄúAnd far more precious than the gold And marble of this holy shrine, The sculptured images divine Their glorious beauty here unfold. ‚ÄúTo this‚Äîto beauty's perfect height‚Äî All being evermore ascends. Whate'er has force and motion tends To life, and harmony, and light; ‚ÄúBut when the eternal spirit rolls Blindly no more through life and death; When now it lives in human breath, And thinks and feels in human souls; ‚ÄúThen perfect beauty first has birth, The product of the artist's thought; Then sculptured forms like these are wrought, More beautiful than aught of earth. ‚ÄúSo let us now rejoice, that we Have lived to build this glorious fane, And given it beauty to remain In earthly immortality.‚Äù He ceased, and mingled with the festive throng, And joined in every gorgeous gladsome rite As gaily as the gayest there, till even Sent home the crowds, all weary of their joys, And down he lay to rest, but could not sleep; So to the Parthenon he wandered back, And gazed upon the moonbeams as they fell Full on the colonnades. All earth and heaven Were hushed. And then, like stars that hide from day But shine at night, far other thoughts arose Upon his spirit, and again he spake: ‚ÄúOh, what is art to those who groan? And what is glory to the dead? When mightier Death has bowed his head, The hero knows not Victory's tone; ‚ÄúAnd all those myriads who to deeds Of fame and glory are not born, Whose life no beauteous arts adorn, Are they no more than wasted seeds? ‚ÄúOh, can we hope for, after this, Another, a diviner life, Free from the taint of wrong and strife, And all that is at war with bliss? ‚ÄúIs there a world beyond the grave, Where justice reigns;‚Äîwhere deathless shame Awaits triumphant wrong, and fame Shall crown the unsuccessful brave? ‚ÄúIs there a better, kindlier land, Where those we deemed but wasted seeds, Because they wrought no worthy deeds, May into flower and fruit expand? ‚ÄúI fear the Ephesian sage is right; That nought endures but only change. What's now familiar once was strange; And day is swallowed up of night. ‚ÄúFrom earth we come, to earth return; All that has ever lived must die. Perhaps the stars that burn on high To ashes in their time may burn; ‚ÄúAnd this our temple, which we call Eternal in its strength and grace, Barbarian armies may deface, Or earthquakes shatter to its fall. ‚ÄúFor time is as a child at play, Creating and destroying still. Alike to him are good and ill; Together both are swept away. ‚ÄúThen what in boundless space are we? And what in endless time am I? Mere clouds upon the eternal sky, Mere foam upon the eternal sea! ‚ÄúYet surely there is hope to find Wherever there is power to seek; And we could never think or speak Of light, had we from birth been blind. ‚ÄúIs he but like a breaking wave Who gazed on beauty with delight, Who longed for knowledge, strove for right, And died, his fatherland to save? ‚ÄúThere comes no answer. From the shore We watch the billows, while the sea Before us lies,‚Äîa mystery Whose depths we never can explore. ‚ÄúOh, could some power divine illume This life of ours, its sorrows cheer, Its gladness purify, and clear The awful mystery of the tomb! ‚ÄúOr could the universal Mind Which through all being ever rolls, And kindles into life our souls, Reveal itself to humankind! ‚ÄúO mighty Mind, Thou art supreme! O Nature, thou art infinite! Our ignorance is densest night; Our knowledge, but a taper's gleam.‚Äù HANNIBAL'S RETURN TO CARTHAGE. My own, my native Carthage! which I serve, Unseen, though loved, these three and thirty years, Through triumph and misfortune, toil and blood. Home of my fathers, and my childhood's home! Once more mine eyes behold thee, still unchanged;‚Äî The rock-built towers that look upon the sea, The forest of the masts that crowd the port; And there the stern old temple where I laid My hand upon the sacrifice, and vowed Eternal hatred to the Roman name. Have I not well fulfilled my early vow? Have I not written deep my quenchless hate In fire and blood, when desolation tracked My path, and many a plain that bloomed before Turned to a smoking wilderness behind; And when the earth was drenched and waters dyed With Roman blood, upon the battle-days Of Trebia, Thrasymene, and Cann√¶? Yes, And have I not remembered thee, my own, My native Carthage? When Italian lands Confessed my sway, and many a goodly town Knelt to my power, my conquests were for thee. Of thee I thought when Rome's best blood was poured, A rich libation to thy guardian gods, Sweeter than oldest wine. Of thee I thought When my Numidian bloodhounds tracked the wolf Even to his den, to Rome; and I rode on And flung my spear into the startled street; For then I deemed that Rome was won for thee. Vain was my hope. Inexorable fate Dashed the full cup of triumph from my lips. Oh, how unlike is this to that return I hoped for! I would have come back to thee With keys of hundred cities in my hands, With many a high-born hostage in my train, And all the treasures of the Capitol; Rome should have been a suppliant in the dust Before thy feet, and thou the queen of all Between the Desert and the farthest Alps. But these are dreams. Carthage! I now return Not as a conqueror, though unconquered yet; I come to save thee, or to die with thee. I fear thy doom is sealed. For this it was Scipio was saved at Cann√¶; and I saw The sign of fate, and told the coming woe, When I beheld my brother's severed head, And knew his battle had been lost. Alas! My valiant brothers! Mago! Hasdrubal! Fate was more strong than you. We once were three, Sons of Hamilcar, bred like lion's cubs To prey upon the Romans; ye are dead, And sleep on distant shores; while I remain Alone to strive against my country's fate. Happy are ye who live not to behold Carthage a ruin! But I mourn too long. One battle still is left for me to fight, And I will fight it like my father's son‚Äî Yes, like my former self. Scipio and I, Heroes of many a well-fought battle-field, And undefeated both, are now to meet; Our meeting shall be like that war of old, When earth-born giants sought to scale the heavens. Vain is the strife that mortals strive with fate, And yet it must be striven. I will not die While they who rule the world will grant me power To serve my country, or to injure Rome; But if the Powers on high deny me both, I have at least a refuge in the grave. THE TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. The place was desert, and the hour was late, And Jesus sank to rest upon the stones, Oppressed with hunger, weariness, and pain. But soon He heard what seemed a heavenly Voice‚Äî Or was it only thoughts within His heart?‚Äî Saying‚Äî ‚ÄúThou art the Christ! the angel told Thy birth before; the host of heaven rejoiced When Thou wast born; a star arose to guide The Magi to Thy cradle; Thou hast seen And felt the Holy Spirit on Thee rest, And Thou hast heard the Voice that called Thee Son; ‚ÄîWhy shouldst Thou famish in Thy Father's house? If Thou art Heir of all things, if indeed Thou art the Son of God, command this stone That it may turn to bread.‚Äù But He replied‚Äî ‚ÄúI came on earth to do My Father's will; And if it be His will to send Me food, He can command the manna; and the life Of man is not sustained by bread alone, But by the words of God.‚Äù No manna fell; But God sustained Him, and He wandered on, Into the Holy City, to the House Of God. Two men beside had come to pray; And Jesus heard them. One looked up and said‚Äî ‚ÄúI thank Thee, God, I am not as other men, Extortioners, unjust, adulterers, Or even as this publican. I fast Twice in the week; I pay the tithe of all; Not only corn and oil and figs and wine‚Äî To pay of these I count a thing of course‚Äî But tithe of anise, cummin, mint, and rue, And every herb that in my garden grows.‚Äù The other dared not lift his eyes to heaven, But smote upon his breast, and muttered low‚Äî ‚ÄòI am a sinner, and confess my sin; I pray Thee, God, be merciful to me!‚Äù And Jesus climbed the Temple's pinnacle, And gazed adown the dizzy height, and saw The people as they came and went. A Voice Like that which in the desert spake of bread‚Äî Or was it only thoughts within His heart?‚Äî Whispered‚Äî ‚ÄúBy faith the Righteous One shall live: Now prove thy faith! now cast Thee headlong down, And God will give His angels charge of Thee To bear Thee up in safety; and the crowds Shall see, and fear, and wonder, and believe; And Thou shalt teach the prating Pharisee Who vaunts his works, what wonders faith can work; And Thou shalt teach the contrite publican That God is near the lowly and the meek.‚Äù And Jesus answered‚Äî ‚ÄúNot with such a sign Can I rebuke the boaster and the proud, Or teach that with My God forgiveness dwells. If God command Me, I will cast Me down; And if His angels bear Me, it is well; If not, I am content to fall and die, Or, if He will, to die upon a cross. But He hath said, Tempt not the Lord thy God.‚Äù And Jesus wandered silently away, And climbed a snowy mountain height‚Äîthe same Whereon, before He died, He met and spake With Moses and Elijah‚Äîand He fell Into a trance; and, in a vision, saw The glory of the realms of all the world Spread out beneath Him:‚ÄîPalestine, and Greece, Egypt, and Rome, and all that Roman arms Had won; nor only these, but lands unknown Beyond where Alexander's conquest paused, Beyond the source of Nile, beyond the plain Where Cyrus perished, and beyond the sea West of the pillars named of Hercules;‚Äî He saw their glory, and He saw their guilt; He saw the temples of their idol gods, He saw the bloodshed of their wars, the smoke Of ruined homesteads, and the captives borne Away to bondage. And a Voice again‚Äî Or was it only thoughts within His heart?‚Äî Whispered‚Äî ‚ÄúThou art the Christ, the Lord of all! Thou art the Son of David, Thou the Priest After the order of Melchizedec; Thy God hath sworn to make Thine enemies The footstool of Thy feet, and Thou shalt rule The nations with an iron rod, and break Their idols like a potsherd. Fire from heaven Fell at Elijah's bidding to consume His enemies; and fire from heaven shall fall, And utterly destroy Thine enemies, Thou greater than Elijah!‚ÄîI ord and Christ, Why tarriest Thou? all these by right are Thine; Thy Father hath ordained Thee Heir of all; Go, enter on Thine own inheritance!‚Äù And Jesus said‚Äî ‚ÄúFor victories such as these I care not, nor to call down fire from heaven. I came not to destroy; I came to save.‚Äù The Voice replied‚Äî ‚ÄúThe tyrant to destroy, And save the lowly‚Äîtherefore art Thou come! Thou, the Messiah!‚ÄîUnderneath Thy reign Peace shall abound while sun and moon endure; And every man shall safely rest beneath The shadow of his fig tree and his vine; The children of the city of Thy God Shall flourish as the grass upon the earth; And prayer and praise shall unto Thee ascend From every generation; and they all Shall call Thee Blessed. Wherefore tarriest Thou?‚Äî Thou, who art born to crush the Serpent's head!‚Äù And Jesus spake and answered‚Äî ‚ÄúThus to crush All idols into dust, and thus to gain Deliverance for mankind from war and wrong, Were easy as the lifting of My hand. But I, the Son of Man, for harder strife Have come, and higher victories than these. Though I be born to crush the Serpent's head, Yet in the strife I must Myself be crushed. I laid the glory of My Father down, And I was born of woman, and I toiled, A village carpenter, at Nazareth; And I will bear My cross unto the end: And he that bids Me lay aside the cross Bids Me not serve My Father, but the world;‚Äî Yea, serve the Power of Evil; for I know, Although thou speakest with an angel's tongue, Thine is the Tempter's voice that tempted Eve, Thine the Accuser's voice that slandered Job, And thou the Serpent I was born to crush!‚Äù He heard the Tempter's voice no more. He saw Satan as lightning fallen down from heaven; And angels brought Him manna, and they sang Of brief affliction and unending joy; The grave re-opened, and the light of heaven Beyond it, and the Serpent crushed in death; The tree of Eden planted, with its leaves For healing of the nations, and its fruit Of life eternal; death and hell and sin Abolished, and the Father all in all. A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED. See Isa. lx. I, 3; Dan. ii. 31, 45; and Mark iv. 26, 32. ‚ÄúWhat is the symbol that may best describe The Kingdom of My Father in the world?‚Äù The Saviour spake, and paused for a reply. Then answered he whom Jesus called a Stone For the foundation of the Church of God: ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of Thy God is like the morn In cloudless glory, when the shadows flee, And earth rejoices. And the kings of earth Shall come, and lead the nations, to adore The brightness of its rising.‚Äù Then the Son Of Thunder answered‚Äîhe whom Jesus loved: ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of Thy God is like the stone In vision of the Babylonian king, Hewn from the mountain by no human hand, Which fell and smote the image that displayed All worldly domination, pomp, and power, Scattering its form in dust; and then became A mighty mountain, filling all the earth. So shall a Stone from Zion's Rock be hewn, To smite the power of Herod and of Rome; So shall the Kingdom grow, and fill the world, And stand for ever.‚Äù But the Lord replied: ‚ÄúYea, rather is the Kingdom like a grain Of seed that groweth up unseen, unwatched,‚Äî The sower knows not how; for of herself Earth bears her increase; first the blade, and then The ripening ear, and then the ripened corn. Yea, like a mustard seed, the least of all, Which groweth greater than the herbs, and spreads A shelter where the birds of heaven may rest. Such is My Father's Kingdom in the world.‚Äù A SERMON BY SAINT PETER. Hearken, my children, and I will declare That which mine ears have heard, mine eyes have seen. The Saviour said:‚Äî‚ÄúBlessed are ye who know That I am Christ, the Son of God Most High. But now another lesson ye must learn: The Son of Man must suffer unto death, Ere He can enter into glory.‚Äù All That heard were sore astonished; and I said ‚ÄúOh, God forbid it! this shall never be.‚Äù But Jesus turned Him round, and on me fixed That gaze which no man could withstand; and said, ‚ÄúGet thee behind Me, Satan, lest thou make My feet to stumble; for thou speakest not The things of God. He that would follow Me Must bear his cross; he that would save his life Must learn to lose it.‚Äù And I stole away‚Äî I who was always foremost of the Twelve‚Äî I who was first to say, ‚ÄúThou art the Christ‚Äù‚Äî I stole away for very fear and shame; And when my brother told me that He said, ‚ÄúLo, there are some of those that stand around Who shall not taste of death before they see The Kingdom of the Christ revealed in power,‚Äù I groaned and wept to think what I had lost. But six days after, as the evening fell, The Lord arose up suddenly, and said, ‚ÄúI go to ascend Mount Hermon: follow Me, Peter and James and John.‚Äù From off my heart A weight of lead was rolled; I wept for joy. Under the stars we mounted. Not a word Spake Jesus; and we pondered, as we went, Those two mysterious oracles‚Äî‚ÄúThe Christ Must suffer unto death;‚Äù and ‚ÄúYe shall live To see the Kingdom of the Christ.‚Äù We said, ‚ÄúNow shall Messiah's purpose be unveiled! All shall be known ere morning.‚Äù We recalled The Baptist's words, ‚ÄúBehold the Lamb of God, Which beareth all the sin of all the world.‚Äù We said, ‚ÄúThe Paschal lamb is slain; the Christ Lives and abides for ever. God will find A ransom, and will save His Son from death. It may be‚Äîyea, it must be‚Äîwe are tried And proved, as Abraham once was tried and proved When God commanded him to sacrifice His son upon Moriah; once again Jehovah will provide, and Hermon now Shall be a new Moriah; and the Lord Will make an altar of its highest height, And God again will send down fire from heaven; And, like Elijah, shall the Christ ascend, A flaming sacrifice, yet not in death‚Äî Yea, shall ascend before the throne of God, And thence return to judge and rule the world.‚Äù At last we reached the summit; by the stars We knew 'twas midnight. Jesus went apart And stood in prayer; but we were tired and faint With travel, and we laid us down in sleep, Till such a blaze of light upon us fell As might awake the dying; and we saw The Christ revealed in glory, with His robes White as the snow in winter, and His face Bright as the lightning; Moses on His right Stood, and Elijah on His left. We said, ‚ÄúIt is as we believed; the time is come; And on the Mount the Three shall set their throne, The Lawgiver, the Prophet, and the Christ.‚Äù But Jesus and the twain together spake; Not, as we hoped, of kingdoms and of power, But of a Victim to be sacrificed, And His departure at Jerusalem. Then Moses and Elijah said, ‚ÄúFarewell! We meet in Paradise!‚Äù But I exclaimed ‚ÄúO Master, it is blessed to be here! Oh, let them not depart, and let us make Our dwelling on the Mount with them and Thee, And we will spend our lives in praise and prayer!‚Äù But then a cloud of light upon us came‚Äî The Glory, the Shechinah‚Äîand we feared And fell upon our faces; and a Voice Out of the cloud was heard, ‚ÄúBehold My Son, My Chosen, My Beloved.‚Äù And we heard And saw no more, but lay like men in trance, Till Jesus said, ‚ÄúArise, be not afraid.‚Äù And we arose; the vision was no more, And Jesus was alone. And on the morn The Lord descended with us from the Mount, To suffer at Jerusalem, as ye know. THE DREAM OF PILATE'S WIFE. See Matt. xxvii. 19. O Pilate! O my husband! let Him go, The Galilean Prophet!‚Äîall the night With thoughts of Him I have suffered in my dreams. ‚ÄúThou must approve thyself as C√¶sar's friend‚Äù? My dream was first of C√¶sar. He was dead; His palace was a place for owls and bats; His spirit went to join the kings of old; And they, arising from their shadowy thrones, Exclaimed, ‚ÄúArt thou at last become like us, Thou who didst crush the nations, and exalt Thy throne above the stars?‚Äù Then changed my dream. Under an olive tree the Prophet knelt; Upon the ground were drops of blood, that fell Down from His brow in sweat of agony; The thunder and the lightning and the storm Were gathering in the heavens; the thunders' voice Spake with the Prophet, saying, ‚ÄúShall we fall And smite Thine enemies?‚Äù And He replied, ‚ÄúFall not; I bow in death. The hour is theirs; The power of darkness ruleth for the day.‚Äù And then the Prophet died upon a cross, Condemned by thee, my husband! but a God Came down from heaven, and raised Him from the grave. Then did the tempest burst; the stars fell down Like leaves in storms of autumn, and the sun Was turned to darkness, and the moon to blood; And then the Prophet mounted on a throne To judge the nations. All before Him stood‚Äî Barbarians, Greeks, and Romans ‚Äî slaves and kings‚Äî In two vast crowds all mingled. And He spake To those who thronged upon His right, and said, ‚ÄúMercy is for the merciful! and ye Who comforted the sorrowing, come and share The blessings of the kingdom of your God!‚Äù Then turning to the crowd upon the left, He said, ‚ÄúNo mercy for the merciless! And ye, who never cared for human woe, Depart, accursed, into agelong fire!‚Äù And they to Tartarus were borne; and thou, My husband, was the foremost of them all! Thou wilt not heed the warning? I depart; We perish; and the guilt shall all be thine. THE CONVERSION OF SAINT JAMES THE LORD'S BROTHER. This poem is written on the supposition, which seems highly probable, that Saint James the Lord's brother, the first Bishop of Jerusalem and the author of the Epistle of James, was not a believer in Christ until after the Resurrection, when he was converted by the appearance of Christ to him alone. Compare John vii. 5 with I Cor. xv. 7. Jesus, my brother! He is Lord and Christ! Though I have known Him from my earliest years As brother in the flesh, I know Him now No more as brother, but as Christ and King‚Äî As Lord and Saviour! Oh, accuse me not Before the Father, that I disbelieved; I only waited for a sign from heaven, And Thou hast granted it!‚ÄîThy living face, Thy living voice, Thy words of love to me! But wherefore was it that I knew Thee not? Why understood I not the Prophet's words, ‚ÄúA Man of Sorrows, pouring out His soul Even to death‚Äù? And wherefore bowed I not Before the Saviour's awful purity? Well I remember, in our early days, When for some childish fault I sank rebuked, Awed by His majesty of gentleness; And all men saw what wondrous signs were showered, In glory and in blessing, round His path; Sight to the blind and utterance to the dumb, Life to the dead, glad tidings to the poor. Can God's forgiveness ever be for me‚Äî For me, who joined the Pharisees and Scribes In asking for a greater sign than these? I might have been among the faithful Twelve, Who‚ÄîHe hath promised it‚Äîshall sit on thrones, Judging the tribes of Israel. And, O Lord, What means that proverb which I heard Thee speak When I beheld Thee living from the dead, ‚ÄúBlessed are they who see not, yet believe‚Äù? Hast Thou no smallest blessing left for me? And yet Thou dost not visit to upbraid; Thy looks were not of anger, but of love; And I recall another word of Thine, ‚ÄúGod giveth freely, and upbraideth not.‚Äù Epistle of James i. 5. This Epistle is so full of allusions to the recorded teaching of Christ, that the above may not improbably be one of His unrecorded sayings. Freely Thou wilt forgive, my Lord, my God! The glory and the thrones remain for those Who shared Thy sorrows and Thy toils on earth; But grant me Thy forgiveness and Thy love; And I will follow Thee! Thou shalt restore The throne of David and of Solomon; All nations shall behold Thy glory; kings From Tarshish and the Isles shall offer gifts, And Sheba and Arabia bow the knee, And Rome pay tribute. I shall see from far; But grant me in Thy Kingdom to be called Only the least and lowliest! And, O Lord, If for Thy Church a time of toil and pain And trial as of silver in the fire, Must come before Thy glory is revealed;‚Äî If those who share Thy throne must share Thy cross;‚Äî Oh, take me! let me drain the cup of woe, So that I suffer and rejoice with Thee! SAINT PAUL IN ARABIA. I should have known Thee as the Christ of God. I should have read aright the Prophet's words‚Äî ‚ÄúA face more marred than any face of man; A sacrifice whereof the poured-out blood Shall sprinkle many nations; crushed, despised, Yet strong to bear the sins and woes of all; A Lamb in silent meekness led to death;‚Äî Therefore Thy God shall set Thee up on high, And from the mighty Thou shalt wrest the spoil, And tread the Serpent underneath Thy feet.‚Äù But for the Christ, upon a cross, to die The death of robbers and of slaves, I deemed Monstrous, unspeakable; and many a word Haunted my memory from prophetic Psalms Of Christ, a priestly monarch, riding on To victory, with His warriors like the host Of Heaven; the dew of youth upon His brow, Jehovah's rod of empire in His hand, To judge and rule amidst His enemies. Oh, how unlike to Thee!‚Äîto Thee, betrayed, Rejected, and abandoned by Thine own! No dew of youth upon Thy holy brow, But drops of blood! Thy martyr Stephen first Awoke misgiving in my secret soul. I saw an angel's glory on his face; I heard his words; they were not like the speech Of one that pleadeth for his life, but words Of some majestic teacher, when the crowd Listens and bows in reverence;‚Äîand he spake;‚Äî ‚ÄúO stubborn children, deaf and blind of heart, Ye, like your fathers, do for evermore Resist the Holy Spirit; and our God Will at your hands require the blood of all His saints and martyrs poured upon the earth From Abel on to Jesus.‚Äù Then they stopped Their ears, and rushed to stone him; but my ears Would not be stopped; I listened, while I saw The angel glory brightening on his face, And he exclaimed‚Äî ‚ÄúI see the heaven of heavens Opened, and I behold the Son of Man Standing beside the throne of God!‚Äù He fell; I saw no more, but heard his dying prayer‚Äî ‚ÄúO Jesus, O my Saviour, Lord and God, Receive my spirit, and forgive their sin!‚Äù Jesus, the Crucified, his Lord and God! I deemed it blasphemy; I onward went To persecute and kill; but on my way His dying prayer was ever in mine ear, And in mine eyes the glory of his face, Dying, like Abel, martyred for the truth, Dying, like Moses, in the light of God. The more my conscience goaded me, the more I strove with conscience; and another voice Spake to my spirit, saying, ‚ÄúPersevere! Drown thought in action!‚Äù and it had prevailed, Until I heard Thy voice upon the way, Speaking, O Jesus! from the height of heaven. I could not hide me from Thy blinding light, O Thou who knowest all my thoughts from far! Thy love has conquered, Lord! and I am Thine. And now, O Christ, the Vanquisher of death, Who hast ascended far above the heavens, Leading captivity captive, and received Gifts from Thy God for men, that Thou mayest dwell With pardoned rebels!‚Äîoh, forgive the past‚Äî Thou hast forgiven it‚Äîand accept my life, And consecrate it, that I may declare Salvation to the nations, and proclaim Glad tidings to the lowly and the poor; Healing to those whose hearts are broken; light To those who languish in the shades of death;‚Äî And let me tell the promise of the time When all the principalities and powers, Thrones and dominions, of the universe Shall be subdued to Thee, and sin and death Shall be abolished, and Thou shalt restore Thy power and Kingdom back to Him who gave, That God the Father may be all in all. SAINT JOHN AT EPHESUS. This poem is written on the supposition, which on the whole appears the most probable, that the fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse are both the work of the Beloved Disciple, and that the Apocalypse is by many years the earlier of the two. The Lord of Glory said not, ‚ÄúJohn shall live Till in the clouds of heaven I come again;‚Äù He only said, ‚ÄúWhat matters it to thee, O Peter, who shalt glorify thy God, Like Me, upon a cross, if John shall wait My coming?‚Äù And indeed I cannot tell What those words mean, although for threescore years I have held communion with the Lord on high; And seen His face which shineth as the sun Shines in his strength; and heard His voice which sounds Like many waters;‚Äîand He gave me words Which, as ye know, I treasured up, and wrote In seven Epistles to your Churches seven;‚Äî And then He sent me visions of the night, And I beheld the doom of Babylon, The end of time, the harvest of the world; And sin and death and hell I saw consume And vanish in the fiery wrath of God. And then the visions ceased, but I became Nearer the Lord than ever; yet more near Than when I leaned at supper on His breast; And higher in His grace than when I stood With James and Peter on the Holy Mount, And saw the heavenly glory of the Lord; For by His Spirit now He dwells with me, And makes me wiser than the saints of old; For many a prophet, many a saint, has longed To know and feel what Christ reveals to me, The crowning truth of all, that God is love. But when He cometh, hath been told to none. For many a year, we deemed He would descend Before our generation passed away, Robed with the Father's glory, in the clouds; And oft I thought on those who died for Him; On Peter, crucified;‚Äîthe cross is now A sign of glory, not a thing of shame;‚Äî On James my brother, slain by Herod's sword; On James the brother of the Lord, thrown down From off the Temple's roof; on Paul, who toiled Most of us all for Christ, and died beneath The sword of C√¶sar; and on those at Rome Who, like Elijah, passed to God in fire; And Stephen, who was first to die for Christ;‚Äî I saw him stoned; a glory from the Lord Fell on his face; the highest height of heaven Was opened to his vision, and he saw The Son of Man beside the throne of God Standing‚Äînot seated‚Äîstanding up to greet His martyr's entrance into heavenly bliss. And when I thought on these, I said, ‚ÄúO Lord Jesus, come quickly! wherefore tarriest Thou? Wherefore must I, who was the best beloved, Who on the Mount saw Thy transfigured form, Leaned at the farewell supper on Thy breast, And to Thy mother was indeed a son,‚Äî Wherefore should I be last to see my God?‚Äù Long was I bound to earth by her whom Christ Gave to my care‚ÄîHis mother, thenceforth mine. So deep the sword had entered in her heart, She could not live among the haunts of men; Jerusalem, Capernaum, Nazareth,‚Äî All cities were alike‚Äîall crowds seemed full Of pointing fingers and of gazing eyes, Whether of friends or foes. Apart we dwelt Beside untrodden ways. A messenger Would sometimes come to tell us how the Church Suffered or prospered, and how men believed In Antioch, or in Ephesus, or in Rome. My spirit burned with longing to proclaim Jesus the Christ to Israel's scattered tribes, And to the heathen; but the Mother's mind With sad and holy memories of the past Was full to overflowing. She recalled The Saviour's three and thirty sinless years; The hope of kingdoms, ending in the Cross; The Resurrection, and the words He spake, Mysterious, brief, unsatisfying; and then The Ascension to the Father, leaving us As those who mourn the Bridegroom; and her thought Was ever, ‚ÄúWhen will He in might return, And heal the aching sorrow of my soul?‚Äù With weary longing of a lonely heart She slowly pined. I watched her wasted form Till I beheld a glory on her brow As of the woman whom, in after-days, I saw in heavenly vision, crowned with stars, Robed with the sun, the moon beneath her feet. See Rev. xii. 1. And so the Virgin Mother, full of years, Of honours, and of sorrows, passed away. Alone I buried her, and thanked my God That she was with her Lord in Paradise, And I was free to serve Him in the world. But now I know what work for me was left;‚Äî Even the Gospel which my willing scribe This day has finished. And I now surmise The coming of the Lord in clouds of heaven Draweth not nigh. A thousand years with God Are but a day, and but a watch of night. And it may be, that yet a thousand years The Saviour purposeth to train His saints In patient expectation. Blest are they Who learn in silent patience to endure; Endurance worketh hope. Perhaps the book Which thou, my scribe, hast finished even now, May be a light through agelong nights of earth, To witness of the Spirit and the Bride. What once an angel told me, I repeat‚Äî Guard ye the oil and wine! Ibid. vi. 6.‚Äîthe wine of Christ, Which is His life, poured out upon the Cross To save the world of sinners;‚Äîand the oil, Which is the Holy Spirit, with His gifts Of light and healing;‚Äîsee ye keep your lamps Burning, until the Sun of Righteousness Arise at last, with healing in His beams. To me the times and seasons matter not. If in the Father's glory Christ appear While yet I dwell on earth, to me He comes. But if He cometh in the guise of death, I shall but fall asleep, and wake refreshed, And see Him in His glory as He is, And bear His image, and be satisfied. A LOST TALENT. See Matt. xxv. 14, 30; 1 Cor. iii. 10, 15; and John xxi. 3, 7. The summer ended, and the harvest past, And I not saved! the talent that was Thine Lost, and for ever! Must I hear the doom ‚ÄúWicked and slothful servant!‚Äù from Thy lips? Wicked perhaps, and foolish certainly, And yet not slothful; no, I did not shrink In sloth from labour; and I did not hide Thy talent in the earth for fear of Thee; Nor was I wicked; for I did not waste In riotous life the substance that was Thine; But with Thy gold I built a goodly house‚Äî A house of cedar‚Äîto adorn Thy lands. But was it for thy service that I built? Or was it but to glorify myself? Thou only knowest, to Whom all hearts are known! I built what pleased myself. I should have built Of stone and marble, to withstand the fire; I should have built of Thine from base to cope‚Äî Christ the foundation, Christ the crowning stone! But this seemed slow and costly; and I longed For praise of men. And I had my reward; For all men praised my building. But the flash Fell from the heavens; the beams of cedar burned Like faggots, hay, and stubble; I was saved With loss of all, and only saved through fire. Naked my mother bare me, and I come Naked before my Judge. Yet, O my Lord, On no foundation did I seek to build Save that which Thou hadst laid. Behold and see‚Äî The fire has burnt it bare‚ÄîI based my house On Thy foundation; but I built the walls, The pillars, and the arches of the roof, Of substance unapproved of Thee; and now I see its worthlessness revealed in fire. O Judge and Saviour! can it ever be The ocean of eternity shall roll Back to my feet the talent I have lost? 'Twere worth an agelong night of doubt and fear And weary toil in drawing empty nets, To see Thee stand upon the beach at dawn, And hear Thy voice, ‚ÄúLet down the net once more!‚Äù And cast, and draw, and find it filled for Thee! ETERNITY. Eternity is not, as men believe, Before and after us, an endless line. No; 'tis a circle, infinitely great, All the circumference with creations thronged: God at the centre dwells, beholding all. And, as we move in this eternal round, The finite portion which alone we see Behind us, is the Past; what lies before, We call the Future. But to Him who dwells Far at the centre, equally remote From every point of the circumference, Both are alike, the Future and the Past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HYMNS. [‚ÄúWorking and Waiting,‚Äù though a hymn, is printed among the ‚ÄúPoems in the stanza of ‚ÄòIn Memoriam.‚Äô‚Äù] THE KINGDOM, THE POWER, AND THE GLORY. Thine, Father! is the kingdom; Thine are the day and night; Thou movest in the moving heavens, And shinest in the light; And Thine the voice of wisdom That speaks within the breast, And giveth guidance to the strong, And to the weary rest. And Thine the power, O Father! The powers we feel and see‚Äî The powers of nature and of mind‚Äî Have all their source in Thee; Thine are the rain and sunshine, And Thine the lightning's blaze; Thine is the power that glows in life, And Thine the power that slays; And Thine the power, O Saviour! Which can alone be made Perfect in weakness;‚ÄîThine the strength Whereon the souls are stayed Of heroes and of martyrs; The power is Thine to free From fear and sin, and over death To give the victory. But where, O Lord, Thy glory? Thy kingdom's brightness, where? In wintry skies and stormy seas, In hardly answered prayer, In stars that burn to ashes, In life that ends in dust, Oh, must we seek Thy glory there, Thou merciful and just? It is not so. Thy glory, O Father, must have shined Where'er Thy power and kingdom are; It is that we are blind. We see but gleams and flashes From a hidden brightness dart; Oh, give us eyes to see Thee, Lord, In glory, as Thou art! But are not gleams and flashes Enough for such as we? The full unveiling of Thy face No mortal eye may see; And is it not sufficient For us, if we behold Thy brightness where the sunbeams shine, And where the stars are rolled; And if we see Thy glory Reflected in the face Of those who live in Thee, and die Victorious in Thy grace? Were I to hear Thee saying, Servant of God, well done! Thy work is proved, thy sins forgiven, Thy battle fought and won; The harvest of thy sowing The time to come shall reap; Now lay thee down in perfect peace For everlasting sleep; So great would be the blessing, My lips could ask no more; No wish nor prayer my thought could frame‚Äî I only could adore. But more than this we hope for; And what we long for most Is not to join the adoring throng Of all the sainted host, And not to meet the loved ones Assembled round Thy throne;‚Äî What most we long for, Lord, is this‚Äî To know as we are known; To gaze upon Thy glory With face to face, and live; For this includes all blessings, Lord, Which even Thou canst give. DE PROFUNDIS. O Lord, we wander in the night; The way is dark and lone and dread; And yet we know with Thee is light; Thou seest all the path we tread. And Thou alone, O Lord, canst see The tears that must in silence flow. The darkness hideth not from Thee; Thou knowest all our secret woe. O Thou who in Gethsemane Hast for our souls the victory won, Teach us with all the heart to say, ‚ÄúLet not our will, but Thine, be done.‚Äù In desolation's darkest hour, When flesh grows faint and spirit fails, Teach us to trust Thy conquering power‚Äî Teach us to trust that love prevails. Unseen by even the spirit's eye, In sorrow's night Thyself reveal; In deepest darkness, Lord, come nigh, And make our souls Thy presence feel Till life and death are past; and He Who ever liveth, though He died, Shall touch our eyes; and we shall see His glory, and be satisfied. THE POTTER AND THE CLAY. See the Epistle to the Romans, ix. 19, 24. Why hast Thou made me so, My Maker? I would know Wherefore Thou gav'st me such a mournful dower;‚Äî Toil that is oft in vain, Knowledge that deepens pain, And longing to be pure, without the power? ‚ÄúShall the thing formed aspire The purpose to require Of Him who formed it?‚Äù Make not answer thus! Beyond the Potter's wheel There lieth an appeal To Him who breathed the breath of life in us. When the same Power that made My being, has arrayed Its nature with a dower of sin and woe, And thoughts that question all;‚Äî Why should the words appal That ask the Maker why He made me so? I know we are but clay, Thus moulded to display His wisdom and His power who rolls the years; Whose wheel is Heaven and earth;‚Äî Its motion, death and birth;‚Äî Is Potter, then, the name that most endears? To Him we bow as King; As Lord His praise we sing; To Him we pray as Father and as God; Saviour in our distress; Guide through the wilderness; And Judge that beareth an avenging rod. I grudge not, Lord, to be Of meanest use to Thee;‚Äî Make me a trough for swine if so Thou wilt;‚Äî But if my vessel's clay Be marred and thrown away Before it takes its form, is mine the guilt? I trust Thee to the end, Creator, Saviour, Friend, Whatever name Thou deignest that we call. Art Thou not good and just? I wait, and watch, and trust That Love is still Thy holiest name of all. I watch and strive all night; And when the morning's light Shines on the path I travelled here below;‚Äî When day eternal breaks, And life immortal wakes, Then shalt Thou tell me why Thou mad'st me so. FORGIVENESS. O Thou who dwellest alone in unapproachable light, Higher than highest heaven, and yet dost bend Thine ear To hear the cry of those who call to Thee out of the night Of pain, and sorrow, and sin, of ignorance, doubt, and fear! The darkness is full of fear, but the light is more awful still;‚Äî The Light in which nothing is dark;‚Äîthe Eye before whose sight All thoughts of the heart are open, all secrets of good and of ill;‚Äî O Father, help us to bear the glory of Thy might! But if Thou seest our thoughts of sin and of sorrow, we trust That a Father's heart is Thine, Thy children's woes to feel; Thou knowest our earthly frame, Thou rememberest that we are dust; O send Thy Spirit of power and love, to forgive and to heal! Save and forgive when the light of our life is overcast, And the noise of toil and strife overpowers the adoring hymn; When the future looms like impassable mountains misty and vast, And all that we trusted fades like an island distant and dim. Forgive us all, O Father! and teach us all to forgive; That all who have done and all who have suffered wrong, may rest In the rest of Heaven, in the peace wherein our spirits shall live, In the light of God which is life, eternally blessing and blest. But is it true, O God, we must loathe ourselves in Heaven See Ezek. xxxvi. 31. For shame of the sins we wrought on Adam's natal sod? Did not the Saviour die, that all might be forgiven? Has not the Christ ascended, that all may ascend to God? We trust the quenchless fire of the wrath of God that burns The chaff, when the chaff is consumed, shall cease in eternal calm; And the breath that awakes the dead from their sleep shall breathe, and the thorns Of the martyr's crown shall bud, and be changed to the conqueror's palm. All that is Thine is ours. See Luke xv. 31. Oh, not to a hopeless Fate, And not to a changeless Law, does our faith send up its prayer. Thy name, O God, is Love!‚Äîno place can be left for hate; Thou, God, art the God of Hope!‚Äîno room can be found for despair. CONFIDENCE. We scarcely know ourselves, O Father! We know not where Thy guiding leads; All that we know is, how to gather Thy manna from earth's stones and weeds; But for all blessing Thee we trust, O Thou who doest all things well! The gates of Hades Thou hast burst; Thou wilt abolish death and hell. All suffering shall in bliss be hushed, All idols into dust shall fall; The Serpent shall in death be crushed, And God the Father all in all. THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. ‚ÄúEvery good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.‚Äù Epistle of James, i. 17, Revised Version. O Thou, from whom all blessing flows! Lamp of the world, whose holy light No rising and no setting knows, And maketh every shadow bright! Because the Light of Light Thou art, From whom the darkness cannot hide, This weak and fearful human heart Can dare in darkness to abide. No evil can have power on me, Under Thy shelter safely kept; And ‚Äúwhen I wake I am still with Thee,‚Äù For Thou wast with me while I slept. THANKSGIVING. Suggested by Miss Havergal's poem on the same subject. Thanks be to Thee, O Christ! who left Thy heavenly throne, And didst the crimson wine-press tread Of wrath, alone; And dare the bitterest pangs of death To make us all Thine own. Thanks for the martyrs that have trod Thy path since then; Proving the Spirit of their Lord Abides with men; Suffering with Thee, in hope to reign With Thee in life again. Thanks for the fruitless tears that fall For others' woe; The hard and tearless grief for sins Of long ago; The hopeless faith that cries to God, ‚ÄúWhy hast Thou made me so?‚Äô Thanks when a groundless fear or hope Away is cast; When, gazing toward its prize, the soul Forgets the past; Thanks for the deep unrest of heart That rests in Thee at last. Thanks when the veil is torn that hid A truth from view; Thanks when we find the letter false, The spirit true; Thanks for eternal hope revealed, Though seen at first by few. Thanks for the bitter joy that finds Its idols clay; Thanks for the quenchless fires that cleanse The chaff away; For morning stars of time, that fade In Heaven's eternal day. HOLY COMMUNION. O Thou from whom no heart is hidden, Thou to whom every thought is known! We come, the guests whom Thou hast bidden, The people Thou hast made Thine own. Thine own we are, and not in vain We seek, O Christ, from Thee to win A painless pity for our pain, A sinless pity for our sin. Though sin and weakness be our dower, We come for healing, Lord, to Thee; We come to eat Thy bread of power, And drink Thy wine of purity;‚Äî To eat the bread that came from Heaven, When Christ first drew a human breath; To drink the wine that Christ has given In pouring out His soul to death; To live the life that first began When Christ the vale of sorrow trod; For Thou, O Son of God, art Man, And Thou, O Son of man, art God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS AND PARAPHRASES. SAINT PATRICK'S BREASTPLATE. The original of this poem is in Irish, except the last stanza, which is in Latin. I have represented the Latin by longer lines than the rest. The irregular stanzas represent those of the original. I am ignorant of Irish, and have made this version from the literal English translation by Dr. Whitley Stokes, which is printed in the Appendix. This poem is certainly very ancient, and is probably the work of Saint Patrick. Its name of ‚ÄúBreastplate‚Äù (Irish luirech, from the Latin lorica) arises from the Irish custom of repeating it, and other poems, as a protection against danger. I bind as armour on my breast The Threefold Name whereon I call, Of Father, Son, and Spirit Blest, Who maketh and sustaineth all. I bind as armour on my breast The power of Him from heaven who came To make the Godhead manifest; His baptism, and His cross of shame, His burial, and His opened grave; And God's Almighty power, whereby He rose, ascended up on high, And shall return to judge and save. I bind as armour on my breast, In hope a heavenly crown to win, The obedience and the love wherein Angels and seraphs are possessed, With faithful prayer and worthy deed Of all the saints in history's roll, Who kept unstained their holy creed And virgin purity of soul. I bind as armour on my breast The might of God, made manifest In Heaven, and on the stedfast earth; The glory of the sun on high, The brightness of a moonlit sky, The lightning's wildly flashing mirth; The splendour and the glow of fire, The storm that rushes in its ire; The strength that girds the rocky steep, The vastness of the unfathomed deep. I bind as armour on my breast The Wisdom which shall be my Guide; The Shield whose shelter bids me rest In peace, whatever ills betide; The Eye of God, to search my thought; His Ear, my prayer of faith to hear; His Word, to make my words be fraught With courage which His foes shall fear; His angel host, to guard my path Against all human guile and wrath, Against the tempter's lures to sin, Against the lusts that strive within. All these I bind upon my breast Against my foes in earth and hell; Against the sorcerer's chanted spell; Idols, confessed or unconfessed; Falsehood of heresy, and powers That rule the heathen in the hours Of darkness; women's evil wiles; And all the knowledge that defiles. Guard me and shield me, Christ my Lord! Guard me against my foes' desire, Guard me from danger of the fire, Guard me against the hostile shaft, Guard me against the poisoner's craft, Guard me from danger of the sea;‚Äî Guard me, O Christ, in serving Thee, And make me share the great reward. Christ be within me and around; Christ on my left hand and my right; May Christ in all my thoughts be found, Christ in all breadth and depth and height! May Christ be in their eyes that see Thy servant, and their ears that hear; Christ in his thoughts who thinks on me, Christ on his lips who draweth near. I bind as armour on my breast The Threefold Name whereon I call, Of Father, Son, and Spirit Blest, Who maketh and sustaineth all. Salvation is of Thee, the Incarnate Word; Now and for ever save us, Christ our Lord! BUNSEN TO HIS FRIEND ROTHE. Being the Dedication of Bunsen's ‚ÄúPhilosophy of Universal History.‚Äù Translated from the German of Bunsen. The original of this poem is printed in the Appendix. Once we wove the bond of friendship on the Capitolian hill, While thou wast, with power of spirit, making known Our Father's will; While we both, in faith and patience, laboured at the work sublime Which the nobler soul of manhood consecrates to God through time. Thirty years have since passed o'er us, bringing care and bringing gloom; Youthful strength and joy have vanished, youthful hope has lost its bloom; But our early aspirations yet retain the force of youth, Strong as when at first they urged us toward the goal of heavenly truth; And our early friendship, changeless through the time that onward rolls, Draws us both, in soul united, toward the fatherland of souls. For we know the human spirit has on earth by flashes shone, And in God's eternal kingdom shall become His living throne; And we know that God is calling on our Fatherland again; And we feel a heavenly Spirit breathing on the hearts of men; And we trust that all our nation's wounds and sufferings He will heal, And His power before the enfranchised German nation will reveal. That which lives for self must perish in the flood of death unwept, But what lives for human glory in the ark shall safe be kept; Every word, and note, and image, glorified by thought Divine, Through the night of earthly ages, to the latest years will shine. From the temple that we gazed on when the morn of faith was red, I have saved a fragment, spared me in the time of want and dread. Bend thy soul‚Äîthou canst, O Teacher!‚Äîtoward the Builder's plan of old, That our spirits in the ruins all its glory may behold. THE INVINCIBLE ARMADA. Freely translated from Schiller. They come‚Äîthey come‚Äîthe foemen's haughty ships, With clang of fetters and a faith abhorred, And thunder on their cannon's brazen lips;‚Äî They come to waste thy shores with fire and sword. A floating host of mighty citadels, Onward they sail with slow majestic motion; Invincible their name; while scarcely swells Beneath their mighty bulk the awestruck ocean. Each tempest holds his breath; a breeze unfolds Their flags, half-imaged in the water's breast; Death, slavery, and destruction in their holds, They calmly glide; and sky and ocean rest As for the gathering of a tempest-cloud, To burst in ruin on thy fated shore. England, thou must not fall!‚Äîthe free, aloud, Shall wail thy doom when thou art free no more. What saved thee then? was it thy warriors, sprung From Norman chiefs that sailed and fought of old? Was it thy Magna Charta, bravely wrung From kings, by men that knew their rights to hold? No! but thy God did not abandon thee To be the prey of tyrants;‚Äîthee He cherished To be the chosen guardian of the free;‚Äî God, the Almighty, breathed upon the sea, And the Armada perished FROM SCHILLER'S SONG OF THE BELL. Summer her bloom must shed, Ere Autumn's fruit can swell; And Passion in many a heart is dead Where Love remains to dwell. FROM THE GERMAN OF K√ñRNER. Not easy is our fight of faith; The glory must be hardly won. The vintage must be crushed in death Before the purple wine can run; And ere a spirit heavenward go, A heart must break in death below. MOONLIGHT. From the German of Matthison. Above the east horizon The moon floats round and bright; The spirit-haunted ruin Is seen against the light. From beds of moss the glow-worms Shine clear with light-green ray; Over the reedy quagmire Marsh-meteors lightly play. The church-tower windows glimmer Against the rising beams; Upon the glassy water Reflected starlight gleams; In silver wave the cornfields Under the moonlight pale; The pine-clad mountain weareth A white and misty veil. How beautiful the moonbeams In lines of silver gleam Upon the gentle ripple That dances on the stream Which here flows under alders, And there through meadow-flowers, And from the restless mill-wheel Falls down in silver showers! MEDITATIONS OF A DEAF MUTE. From the French of M. P. Pelissier. The original of the following is from the introduction to ‚ÄúPoesies d'un Sourd-Muet, par M. P. Pelissier, Professeur-Suppleant √† l'Institut Royal des Sourds Muets de Paris; avec une Introduction par M. Laurent de Jussien. Libraire de Charles Gosselin, 1844.‚Äù It is printed in the Appendix to the present volume. Voice of our fleeting joys thou art, And echo of our lengthened woes, O Poetry! thou art what overflows From the full human heart, And through all nature spreads;‚Äîthe wind's low sigh, The reed that whispers mournfully, The bird, its songs outpouring, The ocean's murmurs that for ever rise, The thunder loudly roaring, In human joy and sorrow sympathize. But I‚Äîmust I, for whom The silence of the tomb Pervadeth all, remain apart, alone? And must all harmony For ever be to me A thing unshared in, unenjoyed, unknown? Are not imagination's dreams the notes Of a rich spiritual melody Wherein my soul in tranquil gladness floats, Like clouds that float in sunset's golden sea? When into reverie I fall, Music ineffable and deep Within my heart arises:‚Äîall My being then doth silence keep As if to hear my soul pour forth her song, And then a thrill of joy runs all my veins along. In hours like these my fancy taketh wings, And, passing that vague space which separates Realities from unsubstantial things, New worlds of music for herself creates. All things, however great, that men invent, Like man, are finite; but the rich gifts sent By God are infinite, and ever true, And ever beautiful, and ever new. The harmony of sound is sealed to me, And yet I think I can its nature know. And ye‚Äîknow ye the ideal melody That hovers, like a dove with plumes of snow, In the mystic heaven where my imagination Revels in beauty, all her own creation? INVOCATION. From the French of C√©sar Malan. Being the introductory poem of his ‚ÄúChants de Sion.‚Äù Father which art in heaven! For love of Christ accept our songs of praise. Our souls would glorify Thy wondrous ways, And all the blessings given, Father of mercies! by Thy loving power, Which Thy good Spirit on our hearts doth shower. AUTUMN AND DEATH. A paraphrase of part of Dora Greenwell's prose poem, ‚ÄúO Amiable Lovely Death!‚Äù The woods are glorious to behold, But all their hues are hues of death; The autumn blast is keen and cold, And soon the russet and the gold Must drift before the tempest's breath. And we, like leaves, must fall and die. But let me through the ages lie Where grass is green, where bloom the flowers, Where earth shall press me to her breast, Where nought may break my dreamless rest. I shall not mark the passing hours, Nor hear the birds, nor feel the rain. Oh, sweet is sleep that follows pain, With silence sweeter far than sound! But let the light enfold me round, And let me feel that Heaven is near, And deep, and awful in its clear And burning heights; and let me gaze Through all its depths, upon the throne Of Him who dwelleth there unknown, Or known in Love's mysterious ways To mortals and immortals shown By Him who came, a world to save, And wept above a human grave. THE END.</field>
