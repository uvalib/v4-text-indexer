      <field name="fulltext">CLARIODUS; A METRICAL ROMANCE: THE FIRST BUIK OF CLARIODUS. Bricht as ane angell schyning in his weid, With force of speir, upon his mightie steid; Rycht large of statour, strong and corpolent, Lyke God of armis Mars armipotent, Wode, burning, full of courage and desyre; For to behald he was ane awfull syre. Everie man meinit Sir Clariodus; Bot maist of all, the mone was pitious Of his four fellowis, his daith dreiding sore. Ane of them buir his bricht helme him before, Ane uther his speir buir unto the feild, The thrid his ax, the fourt his nobill scheild, Into the close in midis of the palice, In quhilk devysit was the fighting place. Beholding on the stairis by and by The King, the Queine, with mony fair lady, When he was armit, fair, close and juint, Upon his steid ascendit at all poynt; His lance he faikit manlie lyke ane knicht, As lucent lamp so leimit he of licht; Manheid at Mars he neidit naine to borrow; He schynit as dois the bricht day-star at morrow, With cirkill of gold about his helmit cleir, All birnand full of bricht stonis deir, Circumferit with roobies radious, Betwixt ilk sirkill bricht and glorious, With goldin schaikeris abone his plumes greine; His ladyis abone all mycht be seine Ane courtche of plesance, of gold all browderit bricht, Quhilk waifit lyke ane streimer castine licht: The michtie bardis of his nobill steid Of bricht gold gleimit as ane gleid: Of redolent stonis schynit his weid royall: It was maist lyke ane thing selestiall Him to behold, so angillyke of hew. Toward the Lumbard knicht he did persew, Full of assuirit manheid and desyre, In thrist of knichtheid birnand lyke a fyre. As furious lyounis eiger to the field, Anone quhen ather uther can behald, Thair is no mair, bot loud gois up the soundis Of silver trumpits and of clariounis; Togidder gois the knichtis in thair weidis, In gois thair spurris in sydis of thair steidis; Furth gois the speiris straicht as ony lyne, Forward they preike with heartis leonyne; As dreidfull dragonis thay togidder drave, Quhyll baith thair scheildis in peices clave, And baith thair speiris in peices brake, The palice reirdit lyke ane thunder crake: Abake from uther they stakirit with sic forse, Quhill at the grund baith lay man and horse. Clariodus was delyver and ?ing, And up he start without abasing, And pullit out his sword delyverly. The Lumbard knicht still efter him could ly; His fute sadly throw the stirrip ?eid, And throw the feild traillit him his steid; Quhom followit Sir Clariodus so fast, That he the steid rein?eit at the last, And him rescoursit wounder manfulie, Saying, Sir Knicht, defend ?ow hardily. With swordis scharp thay can at uther dryve, Whill baith thair helmis bludy war belyve. Thus war thair straikes baith sad and keine Betwix thir knichtis wounderfull to seine; As rugend lyounis ramping ferce and wode, Withoutin mercie scheding utheris blude So furiouslie, that ferlie was to see Undantounit beine thair nobill heartis hee; As foaming boares, in thair melancholie, Thay bet on utheris birnies cruellie, So long induiring without disconfitour, That ferlie was to everie creatour That them beheld and stud them about, How thay micht stand under sic straikes stout. Clariodus so knichtlie he him baire, That everie wicht him praisit that was thair; Sore movit was the Lumbard campioun, That he, quhilk praisit was of sic renoun, So long assail?eit was with great fighting With ane that was of age so wonder ?oung. He raisit up his forcie arme on height, And at Clariodus with all his meikle might Ane straike he ettillit right as he wald him slo; And he anone weill neirer him can go And on the syd him hit the richt arme under, Quhill of his ribis thrie did breke in sunder; Whairof the wound so lairg was and wyde, His bouellis micht be seine out throw his syd. The Lumbard knicht did with the straik doun fall, And ly in soune alse paill as ony wall. To confort him he schoup or he wald stint, Clariodus, did of his hewmind hint, And held his heid up softlie and it schoke. And quhen that he out of his swoun awoke, He said thir wordis wounder petiously, Ha, flour of knichtheid! I thÃ© mercie cry. The uther said, If thow will mercie crave, Make heir ane aith never to clame nor have The Clare Fontane, as we our cunan maid. Thow saifing lyfe Clariodus! he said, My lord, he said, sall never challinge thairtill; Rycht as thow pleisis thy mynd I sall fulfill. Clariodus is past unto the King, Declairing the cace in everie thing, Him praying for the knichtis lyfe also. The King in armis resavit him tho, Saying, Deir freind, quhat ?e desyre of me I thinke of richt that it sould grantit be; For saifit is the honour of this land, Rycht be the noble deidis of ?our hand. This woundit knicht rycht softlie up thay take, And in his chalmer gart his bed be make; And gat him leiches his woundis for to sie, The trustiest that was in that cuntrie. Clariodus is to his chalmer gone, Quhair his body unermit was anone, Ane leich to him beine fetchit hastilie, Quhilk did his woundis ryp attentivelie, Him conforting, and bade him take gud hart, For he belyve wald be helit of everie smart. The King ane furrit mantill hes him send, And bad alwayes thay sulde him till attend. Albeit in heart noble he was and wicht, Out of his chalmer go he no might For ?aiking of his woundis newe and greine; Bot ane sight of Meliades the scheine Micht more him confort, I dar take on hand, Nor all the leiches into Lumbard land. Quhen endit was the battell on this ways, All the lordis bounit hame with haill advyse. Oft visit hes the King Clariodus, And eik the Lumbard knycht that sore woundit was. Quhen awcht dayis past war and gone by, Meliades hes called privily On hir maistres, saying on this maneir, ?e know how Clariodus full deir First sould be haldin with my father the King, Syne with his barrounis, abone all uther thing, That for our saikis in hand tuike sic battell, And of his woundis he is not ?it haill; Sen the first day that he his chalmer tuike, I ?eid him not to visie nor to looke. Hir maistres said, It war ?our grit honour To visit him quhilk is of knichtheid flour; And now the tyme is maist convenient, The King is furth with all his houshald went, And he rycht long thinkis him alone, Of ?our cuming he wald be glaid anone. Meliades, richt fresch and weill beseine, With hir hes taine twa ladyis fresch and scheine, With hir awin maistres, digne and verteous, [And] past to visie Sir Clariodus; Whair scho him fand with few in companie, On his bed-syd sitting bot quyetlie; Ane goune of claith of gold his sarke abone, Furrit with mertrix. His collour changit sone At hir incuming, and he on fute up start, Within his breist for joye dansit his heart; Quhen that he saw his ladie most bening, For joyfulnes a word micht not out bring. With humbill, sober and womanlie effeire, Adoun scho sat besyd him in ane chyre. And quhen scho did behald this lustie knicht So fair, so ?oung, so valiand and so wicht, Cupid, that lord, with his scharp grindine dairt Full suddanlie hes strukine hir to the heart, So that scho sat bot with changing hew; The fyre of heit it kindlit is of new Of luif within hir breist, birning so sore, That scho desyris of this warld no more Bot him onlie to have in companie, That under Mars beine flour of chivalrie. This war they wyndit baith in lyk maneir, As micht be sein be thair face and cheir; With luif so sore thair spreitis was bereft, That not to speike ane word was left. Meliades, rycht lustie and bening, Said to the squyeris and to the madinis ?ing, Thay ?onder moir in chalmer sould disport, Whill scho few wordis of counsall sould report Of mediceine unto the woundit knicht. On this maneir than spake this goodlie wicht, O ?e my tender freind Clariodus, Weill auchtin I of ?ow to be joyous, That to this regioun brocht hes sic honour; And specialie, abone all creatour, My father aucht to chereis ?ow, and love Nixt God and santis into the hevin above; For quhen his knichtis the battell all refuisit, ?e that ar ?oung and not in armis usit On ?ow it tuik with manlie countinance, And weill mentinet to the uterance. Clariodus said, Madame, so Chryst me save, It is not I that all the thanke sould have Of this battell nor of the victorie, The thanke ane uther servit mor nor I, That caus was haill of the discomfitour. Na, said this fair and lustie creatour, Nane uther was bot ?e, the treuth to tell, Quhilk did the schame out of the court expell; For had not beine ?our honour and bewtie, ?on knicht, but faill, had riddin on this contrie, Quhilk had beine to this realme ane lake; The laud is ?ouris, I dar that undertake. Hir answereit on this wayis Clariodus, Madam, I mervell not that ?e say thus, ?our noble nurtur and womanheid bening ?ow sufferis not to say no uther thing, Thais wordis came of gritt nobilnes; Nor was my deidis of praise or worthines: Bot for to tell the trewth unfen?itlie, Ane uther was the caus aluterlie, That vincuist was the Lumbard knicht in feild. Meliades then reddilie him beheld, Saying, That persoun I wald know I wise. Madame, he said, gif ?e will graunt me this, That ?e will me commend unto that wicht, And fullie do ?our bissines and micht, That my service thay hald exceptabill, And of thair hienes digne and honorabill That thay will not my symplenes conteme, Than sall I gladlie that persoun to ?ou name. At schort, scho sayis, thair is no thing at all Efter my micht bot for ?ow do I sall, Saiving my honour and my womanheid. Madame, he said, Pleis it ?our guidlieheid, ?e mane it secreit keip and not discure. Thairto I grant, said scho, I ?ow assure. Madame, he said, ?e ar Kings dochter deir, Reveill me not, as ?e have height me heir; And gif ?e doe ?our pouer, as ?e say, Anents that persoun, helpe me mair ?e may Nor ony that be levand now on lyve. Now, Lady myne, I will me to ?ow scryve, It was ?our self, if I the truith declaire, That only was the caus of my weilfair; ?e war my strong protectour, and only The caus dreidles of all my victorie: Trest weill, Lady, that now I fein?e nocht; For, be the Lord that all the warld hes wrocht, Only your bewtie and your womanheid Put fra my heart all couardice and dreid: I do mein ?our mercie and ?our grace, For sen the tyme that I saw first ?our face, I have ?ow luifit ouer all eardlie thing; Into my mynd full oft asking, That it had stand upon sic ane cace, Nane upon lyf was abill to ?our grace, Bot be hard fighting in sik degree Sum deids of armis ordeinit war on hee That everie man for dreid sould it forsaike, Than wist I weill I suld it wndertake, The feild, alswith to win worschipe or die; For ather had beine worschipe unto me To wine my lady quhom I luifit so, Or to be donne or to be out of woe. Then weill lang still held hir Meliades, Syne unto him scho sayis on this wayis, How may I trow ?our sawis, saying thus? ?e have beine lang into the court with ws, And never befor sik thing to me ?e movit, Sum tyme I wald persavit, hade ?e me luifit. Madam, quhen I begane ?ow for to luif, My mynd I durst not schaw [?ow] for repruife; For I to ?ow was no comparisoune, Sa monie prinsis nobill of renoune ?e had in proffer, quhom ?e list to take, And I, unworthie was, I wndertake, Into so heigh ane mater to proceid. And ?e, Madame, the rose of lustieheid, Now at the leist is bund to keip secreit; Quhairfor I traist, My Hartis Lady sweit, Gif ?ow no list rew on my painis sore, ?e will keip secreit if ?e will do no more; And as I dar, for my wnworthines I cry ?ow mercie, flour of gentilnes, As I that sall unto my lyvis end Lawlie ?ow serve and never ?ow offend. Advysit was this lady quhat to say, For scho was wyse and honorabill ay; ?it nevertheles luif did hir so owercum, That lang scho sat all speachles and dumbe; And at the last scho said, Clariodus, Gif it be so that luif I grant ?ow thus, ?e salbe to me trew and diligent, Rycht faithfull, secreit and obedient, And ower all wemen that ?e me love and serve Bot fein?eing ay till the day ?e sterve, And ever about to save my honour, And not for lust persew me as ane lichour; Fynd I ?ow set to hurt my honestie, Dreidles at ?ow I will more greifit be, And have ?ow in moir haitret and reproufe Nor of befor I had ?ow into luife; Gif we guid luif and trewth to uther meine, It sall the longer lest ws two betweine, Bot gif we schap to crabe our creatour, It sall no longer prosper nor indure: Thairfor sic thingis if ?e list to fulfill, Say on to me, and I sall say thairtill. Madame, quod he, till all that ?e have said I me conforme, be God that me hes maid, ?ow never to dissobey, nor ?it to grieve For all the dayis that I have heir to leive; Bot ever moir to folow ?owr intent, Richt as ?e now give me commandiment. Than tenderlie the fair Meliades Kissit hir knicht into maist gudlie wayis, And freindlie in hir armis him resavit Alse far as scho micht gudlie unpersavit. When all agreit, than bunden war thir two With aithis great, ay to love uthar so That it sould lest withouttin departing. Betwixt thir loveris, in ane taikineing, Two litill chan?eis interchangit they, In rememberance of thair trouth for ay. Of uthars diverse maters spak they syne, Whyll bricht Apollo westwart did declyne; Than raise hir maistres fra hir companie, And said that it was supper tyme neir by. Meliades than tuik hir [leave with wo;] Bot ?it hir heart micht not depart him [fro,] With easie sichis and inward behalding, As for that tyme they maid [thair] depairting. Gritlie rejosit was Clariodus, That with his lady was comfortit thus; He heallit of his woundis day be day, Quhill all his painis worne war cleine away; Than passit he to see the Lumbard knicht, Him doing comfort oft at all his micht. Clariodus in court I let dwell still, And of ane uthar mater speik I will. It is cumin to the King of Spainis eare, The wonderfull beawtie and the fresch effeir Of Mandonet, the lustie creatoure, Quhilk dochter was unto the Earle Estour. He thocht he wald have hir in mariage; And, with advyse of his haill barrownage, Ane fair ambassat schortlie hes he send, To bring this mater schortlie unto end. The message buire four knichts, mikle to pryse, Sir Leonet de Beaulieu wicht and wyse, Sir Leonet de Mortemer, Sir Ame de Beaufort, Sir Arthur de la Roye, with lustie sorte, To Estur cuntrie sought with diligence; Schawing anone thair letters and credence Unto the Countes wyse and sapient, For than the Earle was not at hame present. Scho thame resavit with great feist and cheir, With companie of ladyis fresch and cleir; And maid them byd, with mirrines and cherisching, Wpon hir Lord the Earlis hame cuming; Quhilk at his cuming fairlie can them treit, And [did] bring furth his dochter Mandonet, Quhilk [prysit was for wit and rare beautie.] Now schort into this mater for to be, Sir Leonet hir weddet with ane ring In the name only of his prince and king, And gave to hir ane full rich diamand. This beand donne, Earle Estour, avenand, Feistit them gudlie dayis two or three; Syne them rewairdit eftir thair degree. Returnit ar thir knichtis hame againe Unto their mightie king and soverane, Whom in the toune of Walburgh thay fande, Bot three days jurnay from Earle Estours land; Rehearsing all [to him] both more and les, How them entreitit Earle Estours nobilnes, And how within a monthis space but more Sould be his wadding day; quhairfore He hes gart warne throw all his regioun Baith duikis, earlis and knichtis of renoune, For to be thair againe the justing day On horse armit redie for tornay. Clariodus, ryding at his disport, He met his fatheris message, with reporte Of all thir foirsaid thingis to be donne, Commanding him that he sould speid him soune Hame to his cuntrie. And quhen Clariodus Had hard thaise tithingis thay have ordanit thus, [He] maid the messinger pas to his In But wordis mo, and hald him clois thairin, Quhill he anon sould schaw him his intent. Clariodus is to his lady went, Meliades, and tauld hir all the cace, Saying, Madame, for all my dayis space Sen that I am becum ?our servitour and thrall, Ather ?our leave heir hartlie have I sall, Or in this land at schort I sall abyde For weill or wo, betyde quhat may betyde; For ?ow, Madam, I never think to displeis. Meliades in hart had litill eis When scho had hard Clariodus intent; Saying, My Knicht, richt weill I am content That waddit beine ?our sister with the King Of Spain?ie land, quhilk is ane mightie rigne: Bot loath I war, if otherways micht be, That ?e sould now depairt so far fra me; To reasoun ?it obey will I ever mo, Suppose my will is ?e not went me fro; Bot sen it reynes to worschip knichtheid, Consent I will, thairfor great God ?ow speid; ?e sall first leave ask at my father the King, Syne speike with me at ?our depairting. Clariodus unto the King is went, And of this mater tauld him the intent; Whairof the King was glaid, and said, Truely I am content, it is ane fair allay; The King of Spain?e is ane michtie King, And eik we sall tham have be that wedding; Have we tham our freindis that be in that countrie, And this always cums weill, as thinkis me. His Thesawrer he gart be efter sent, And chargit him to give incontinent Two thousand floringis to Clariodus, To support him passing hameward thus. He did the King rycht speciallie beseike, That his four fellows pas micht with him eike; To quhilke he grantit upon heartlie wyse; His leave he tuike schortlie to devyse. Clariodus, rycht as the day up cleiris, Adressis him and his four nobill feiris, And hes gart graith thair harnes at all poynt, That in thair armour thair was no disjoynt. Clariodus unto his lady went, The uterance to have of hir intent; Speiring at hir quhat collour he sould taike, Or in quhat hew he just sould for hir saike, Or weir in tournay quhile his hame cuming. Meliades micht not ane word out bring Ane weill long space, for inward paine and wo, That he sould pairt so suddenlie hir fro; And quhen that scho owercam, than said scho thus, My best belovit knicht Clariodus, Uneis my wofull spreit may susteine The hevie pains now that in my breist beine For ?our depairting; bot, as I said before, My will I sall constraine with sighis sore, Sene with honour may it not remeid, And [?ow] to weir I gif the cullour Reid, ?our name and honour wald [I] not impair; Fair weill my knicht, and raught him thair Ane heart of gold with stainis casting licht: This sall ?e have in rememberance of richt That ?e my heart have and no mo, Quhilk in na maner may be pairtit ?ow fro. This heart he tuike, and thankis to hir ?old; And gave to hir ane braclet wroucht with gold, About hir arme praying hir it to weir. Scho kissit him with womanlie effeir. They tuike thair leave at utheris pitiouslie, With tirie faces, imbracing tenderlie; And to hir ladyes all gude nicht he said, Bot naine he kist for aith that he had maid To kisse no lady efter his lady bricht Whill that he hade againe of hir ane sight. That nicht he and his fellows tuke them rest, And on the morrow them to the way hes drest. Clariodus in passing to his countrie With his foure fellows, lustie for to sie, Thay hapinit in ane blisfull morrow scheine To ryde out throw ane gudlie forrest greine, Quhilke callit was the Wode of Eventouris, In quhilk oftymes walkit knichts of King Arthouris Eventouris seikand, as the wse was than. Clariodus said, that we will everie man Eventuris seike be syndrie wayis ryde. Anone thay have depairtit and can devyde. Clariodus, within a litill space, Ane pitious voice he hard crying Aleace! Lamentablie, as it ane woman ware. His steid he rein?eit and raid nar, And as he followit on the cry, He saw foure knichtis enarmit richly, Having [with] them ane lady wo begone; Ane litill dwerff fast efter them can gone. Quhen scho had of Clariodus ane sight, Scho said, Have mercie on me, jentill knicht, Help, for thy manheid and for thy ladyis saike, Me, that am falslie from my husband taike Be the handis of thir knights fellounlie, Quhilk hes him lest woundit cruellie In poynt of death. Than said Clariodus, Fair Lordis, be in heart piteous, And be asschamit fair ladyes to offend; Weill glaidlier thair caus ?e aught defend. Sir Knicht, thay said, Pas quhair ?our erand lyis, ?our appetite we will serve in no wayis. Clariodus said, Heir I make God judge, I sall be deid or scho sall have refuge. And he anone, inermit all in reid, [The quhilk his lady choisit for his weid,] With speir in hand, he spurit fast his steid, And to the formist knicht hes went gud speid, And to the erd him drave so fast but ho, Whill that his nek on force it birst in two; And he was hurt a litill throw his geir Be his fellow, bot haill that baid his speir, Whairwith he ran upon the other thrie, Betwixin quhom begane ane hard mellie: Ane uther to the erd he drave adoun, His lymb to fruschit, and he fell in swoun; The lady and the dwerff fell him abone, And wald have cuttit his throte rycht sonne. Clariodus, thocht that he had mikle adoe, Espyit hes, and thir wordis said them to, To be so cruell and to slay ane knicht, Madam, it settis to na lady bricht. The uther twa knichts assemblit on him fast, Hard was the feild and fell, quhile at the last Clariodus thocht on his ladie bright, And at the thrid knight straik with all his micht, Whill that his helme quyte from his heid he straike, Mercie he askit then for Chrystis saike, And ?eildit him his sword incontinent. The fourt knicht than maid na impediment, Bot said, Sir Knicht, we cum ?our prissoneiris, And heir I obleiss me and all my feiris At ?our command to stand and at ?our will, So that ?e list heir mercie grant ws till. Clariodus was woundit in the syde, ?it never ?eildis quhile they to mercy cryed, For rewth hes restrainit his nobill heart From crueltie, and sonne he did advert Wnto thir knichtis, and said, For your trespas, At ?one lady ?e sall ga mercie ass And forgivenes; and syne ?e sall me sweir, On sik maneir never woman [to] deir; Syn to Great Britane pass ?e sall all sweith, And to the King the maner all ?e kyth; Syn for the fairest lady in the land ?e speir Dwalland in the regioun far or neir, And ?eild ?ow to that lady benigne, Schawing to hir but [ony] fen?eing, Say that the Reid Knicht hes ?ow to hir send, Quhilk hartfullie to hir dois him commend. Thay sweare all be the ordour of knichtheid, That in all haist this sould be donne but dreid. The lady thankit oft Clariodus, Saying, Most nobill knicht and chyvalrus, Wyld is the land, and ludging heir is none; Bot if ?e wald disdaine with me to gone, My duelling place is at the forrestis end, ?e gar thir knichtis also with ?ow wend My husbands frindschip with them for to make, And I ?our woundis dar weill undertake, For I in leichcraft have sum skeill and kuning. Clariodus hes grantit to this thing, And gart thir forsaid knichtis with him ryd; He gart the dwerff with the slaine knicht abyd, Whill they sent for him efterwart; and so Togidder with the lady can thay go, Whill they com to the mikill forrest end; Then from hors thay did thair discend, And with the lady they enterit in the place, Quhair thay resavit war with grit solace. The knichtis to ane chalmer than thay ?eid, And laid soft salves to thair woundis reid. Scho brocht hir Lord unto Clariodus, Gyl?eam de la Weille, worthie and famous; Quhilk thankit him of his great nobilnes, That did his wyfe againe to him redres, Putting his bodie into sic eventure, And syne had maid the haill discomfitour; Whairfor he ?eild him self and all his guide, To him quhilk frindlie in his quarrell stude. So, be the knichts war to the supper set, Clariodus fellowis knokit at the ?et, For thair nane uthar harberie was about, And of thair cuming blyth was all the rowt; Bot sonne thay speirit of Clariodus, Gif any wist of sik ane knicht antrus, Quhilk from thame twinit in the morrow tyde, Walking alleane out throw the woodis wyde, In reid arrayit, baith in scheild and speir. The Lord ansuerit, Fair knichts have ?e no feir; I dar weill say and eike thairat abyde, War all the knichtis in this warld so wyde, Boune unto battell under birneis bricht, He micht amongs thame countit be ane knicht; Heir he is ludgit in this ilk place. As it befell, he tauld them all the cace. Be everie knicht hade tauld his eventur, What him betydit as he throw forrest fure, Alreadie was the supper to tham dicht. Gill?iam de la Weill spake with voice on height, My Lordis, ?e ar all welcum to this place, Amongis ws tak in patience Godis grace. Fair Sir, sweitlie said Clariodus, Methinks it best, according war it thus, Togidder all to soupe, micht it ?ow please, With ?one hurt knichts, micht it them ease; And this I pray ?ow doe for the luife of me, In hope that we sall all the glaider be. The Lord him thankit lawlie at his micht, Saying, Thais wordis come of ane nobill knicht. As he devysit, so was it donne all swyth; To supper went thir lordis glaid and blyth, And everie man was mirrie and joyous, For gud accordance maid Clariodus Amongis the knichts with all his diligence, And everilke feide forgiven is and offence. The Lady tuike upon hir great travell, Whyll that scho maid him of his woundis haill; Then courteslie he tuike his leave and wend, To lord and lady oft doing him commend, To tham and to the woundit knightis thre; Syn toward Esture land the way tuike he. When that the knichtis thrie war haill and sound, And haillit syne of everie grevous wound, Thay tuike thair leave at lord and lady eike, Them thankit syne with myndis myld and meike; And passit syne in Ingland to the King, Declairing him the cace in everie thing, How it befell as ?e have hard beforne; And how they all oblist war and sworne, To ?eild thair bodies to the fairest wight, That was in Ingland into manis sight; And be the way how all men did thame wise, Wnto the guidlie fair Meliades. The King said, Freindis have ?e no knowleging Of him that sent ?ow with sic tyding. The knightis said, No more of him we knaw, Bot the Reid Knight he namit was our aw. The King did send to chalmer for the Queine, As also for Meliades the scheine, And gart the knichts rehearse thair taill all new. Meliades a litill changit hew. The knichtis said, Full weill it may be kend, ?on is the Lady quhome to we ar send. Anone upon thair kneis in humbill wyse, Thay sat all thre befor Meliades, And said, Madam, heir we ar all, only Be the Reid Knicht sent, flour of chevalrie, To ?our bewtie our bodies for to ?eild, As we that vincuist beine with him in feild; ?e doe with ws Lady as lykis ?ow best, ?ouris we ar, demaine us as ?e list. Sumthing abaisit was this guidlie wicht, Siris, scho sayis, I thanke that gentill knicht, And ?e also are welcum for his saike, ?our prisson sable soft I wndertaike; Go and disport with my father the King, And dwell alse long as beine to ?our lyking; Syne as ?e came alse frelie sall ?e wend, For love of him that hes ?ow hither send. The king resavit tham on fair maneir, And said to them, My tender frindis deir, Heir ar ?e welcum with me to remain, Quhen that ?e list ?e may return again; We will not hald ?ow heir as prissoneiris, Bot chereis ?ow as to ?our stait effeiris. He gart rewaird tham wonder royallie. Meliades them treitit gentillie, And gave them giftis; and thay anone On lawlie wayis hes taine thair leave to gone, And to thair cuntrie passit, quhair that thay Full vertuouslie leivit thair for ay. Clariodus hes sped him day and nicht, Whill of his fatheris castell he gat a syght. Of his cuming his frindis was full blyth; Thay drest them to the mariage belyth, For on the morne thair tryst was for to ryde, The king of Spaine did on thair cuming byde. On morrow as the day it waxit licht, The court was on horse alreadie dicht; Fair Mandonet was lustilie beseine, In clothing as effeirit to ane queine, With croune of gold abune hir hairis bricht Of leming stainis casting pleasant licht; The Earle wes cloathit in full rich array, With him his Lady fresch as is the May: Bot all exceidit them Clariodus, In cloath of gold and stainis pretious. With nobill court, this royall rout furth raid, Whill thay com quhair this mightie King abaid. The nobill King gart two Duikes resave The ?oung Lady, and hir to chappell have, Quhair scho was maryit with great solemnitie, And feastit with triumph and royaltie; Syn all the day did sing, dance and disport, The circumstance war long for to report. The king of Spaine he had ane sister fair, Quhilk Donas height of collouris rycht preclaire; This lady oft behald Clariodus With frindlie cheir, and luikis amorus, Of manlie having and knichtlie governance Heiring the courte greatlie him advance, Quhilk it sa far into hir hart can sinke, Whyll at the last of luif scho tuike a drinke; So birning was hir heart with inwart fyre, For thrist of love, heat birning desyre, That scho wes vexit with the feveris quyte, Quhairof as now me list not to indyte. The day passit, the nicht sonne efter went, On morne the King gart cry ane tornament; Ane hundreth knichts of Span?ie war ordand, Aganis ane hundreth knichts of Estour land; On Spain?ie syd was Leonet the knight, And Oliphere de Beaulieu bauld and wight, Sir Leyon Dormal, Sir Ame de Beaufort, Thair namis all it neids not to reporte: On Esturis half was Sir Clariodus, Sir Palexis baith wicht and chivalrus, Sir Amador de Brusland rycht duchtie, Sir Gil?am de la Forrest rycht worthie, Sir Richard Maianis of Scottis natioun, With mony uther knichts of great renoun. Quhen they disjunit had was no delay, In knichtlie weidis thay doe thame selfs aray, And baith the sydis assemblit in the feild, With speir in hand, and coverit ower with scheild; Againis the face of Phebus casting licht, In windois lay the lustie ladyis bricht, Duchesis, countesis and madanis to have sight, And eagit lordis that was mikle of might; The King of Spaine, and the Earle Esture, And thame selfs ilk ane on ane coursour. With trumpit sound the tornament begane, Out throw the feild the knichtis feircely ran; The raschis of speiris did as the thunder rare, Lyke as the darding rumbling in the aire, The horse feit dinnit with noyis full loud, Then all abune thame raise into ane cloud For sand and dust that thair up raise on loft, Of armit men the meiting was unsoft; The speiris brake, the horse togidder drave, The scheildis fruschit and helmes all to clave; The foirsaids knichts togidder did redound, Quhilk magrie thame thay sink unto the ground. To manis eare full terribill was the raird Of horse and harneis rusching to the eard, The bairdit steidis plunging on the greine, The awfull straiks of knichtis in thair teine, The clariounis sound, the heraldis voice and cry, The cairfull echo ?almering to the sky, The foming steidis with sweit alse quhyt as snaw, With bludie sydis alse soft as foull in schaw; Gois throw the preise, quhile that braith them serve Thair is no mair but do or schame deserve. Clariodus with this ?it held him still, Whill Estures folkis abak mauger thair will Constrainit war; and than he belyve With all his force amongs [them] he could dryve; All gois to grund befor his mightie speir, With birning mynd furth braiding as ane beir, As furious lyoun raiging ferce and fell, So fairis he of knichtheid floure and well; He drave doune hors and knichts upon the greine, Was nane of Spain?ie his straik that micht sustine, They went abake richt fast befor his face, Whair ever he come they list him rune a speace; Throw quhom his fellowis curage tuike anone, And thay of Spain?e schope abake to gone. So come thair wnwarlie on Clariodus Ane Count of Spain?e, bauld and chevalrus, Quhilk straike the bucles of his scheild in sunder Richt frelie, and raif the hauberk wnder. His foure fellowis him dressit in his scheild, And syne the Earle he sought out throw the feild, And strak him to the erd, baith horse and man; Syne throw the feild efter his horse he ran, And rein?eit him, and to the Earle him brocht, Saying to him, My Lord, I know ?ow nocht. Then leuch the Earle and said, Forsuith, Sir Knicht, ?e have me laid to sleip or it be nicht. Gude Sir, he said, or I to luging went ?e me wnarmit, contraire my intent. Among thamselfis [thus] they can disporte; The tornament war long for to report, Or all thair nobill deidis for to declair, Induiring quhile the sune wastwart did repaire [And] in his nocturne mantill did cheroude, The trumpits blew to the retreit full loud, And with their voice the heraldis cryit Ho; And everie knicht did to his luging go, And thame wnarmit in chalmeris haistilie, Araying thame againe full richlie In uther clothings, as did thame effeir; Syne to the palice went to thair suppeir. Foure aigit knichts the King gart efter send, And foure heraldis that best armis kend, And bade that on thair trewth it sould be schawd, Of tornament quha wan [maist] praise and laud. Thay answeir maid, and said, with voice on height, Thay have weill previt everie nobill knicht As men of deidis wondour chevalrus; Bot all the praise we gif Clariodus. Rycht have ?e jugit, sayis the nobill King, He hes the fairest knichtis begining That ever I saw, and maist chyvalrus curage, Hie God preserve him quhill he be in age. The heralds and the knights he gart pas Unto his sister, the lustie fair Donas; And bad that scho sum taikin fair sould send, As he that hade the laude and the commend And [the] heigh praise of the tornament. And so thay did, and to the Lady went. Scho him hes send, wroght full curiouslie, Ane plesant wompill, with stonis set mightelie, Circulit and set with subtile work of gold, That it ane guidlie sight was to behold. Thir Lordis, at commandement of the King, Ar passit to Clariodus the ?ing, Saying, The King hes understanding richt, That ?ouris beine the praise of everie knycht, That hes this day beine in the tornament; Wherefore the Kingis sister reverent, With uther ladyes, hes sent ?ow ane plesance, Off thair bewtie to have rememberance. Clariodus than changit hew alyte, And said, I thank my ladyes fair and quhyte; Bot worthier knychtis thair wer the praise to have, And eik moir dingne this plesance to ressave. Throw the requeist of lordis that wer thair, Ressavit he hes the wompill ferlie fair; And right anone about his arme it band, Thanking the King, right lowlie inclynand: He gart reward the heraldis richlie, With hie voicis they all did Larges cry. When suppit hade the fresche Clariodus, The four auld knichtis, worthy and famous, With him to chalmer he tuik in companie, And gave to thame four clothingis of gold mightie. And to the Kingis chalmer went ifeir, Baith erle, lord, knycht and bacheleir, Disporting thame with ladyes of plesance, And with ?oung virginis meik of countenance. The Kingis sister sat with Clariodus, With humbill cheir, to whome scho speikis thus; Clariodus, It dois ?ow weill perteine, To marie with some guidlie ladie scheine; For whill ?e are in this estait, perfay Sir, ?e be seikand aventuris ay. I am (quoth he) of littill availl or might, To have in mariage ony guidlie wight. Clariodus, scho said, full suith they tell That sayes ane man that praisis not him sell The moir he beine to praise with uther men; Sir, be experience this of ?ow I ken: Thus speikand they of materis to and fro, Quhill it wes tyme to beddis for to go. Indurit long this feist with joy and play, Whill at the last Earle Esture on a day, With all his court of lordis and ladyis fair, Thair leave hes taine, hameward to repaire: Fair Mandonet remenit with the King. [One ?eir did scarce compleit its revolving] Whill scho buir him ane sonne height Clariodus Efter his eime the gud Clariodus. Thay luifit ather uther tenderlie, Whom of moir not speike will I. Erle Esture at his Lady leave hes taine, And toward Ingland passit is againe. The way furth ryding with his companie, He met ane Squyer musing hevilie. The Earle demandit quhy he sorie was. My Lord, he said, this is the verie caus; In the land of Galice, my native contrie, Thair enterit is, that hidious is to sie, Ane lyoun strong and hidious to behauld; Thair is no living creature sa bald, That dar his will impunge or ?it resist; He hes all [haill] devorit as he list, And wastit all the cuntrie up and doune; Is nane so hardie dar make objectioun; And I am seikand, that evill beine to get, Ane knicht that dar his face againis him set And him distroy and vincuis with his brand, The quhilk, I traist, no man dare take on hand. Than said the Earle swiftlie, I am woe That sic ane nobill prince is vexit so. The Squyer tuike his leave, and hyne is went. Clariodus unto his taill tuik gud tent, And at his Father soune he askit leave The strong lyoun in batell him to greive. His father is displeasit, and inschew Dangeris thairin quhilk he micht nocht eschew. The uthar with sic instance him besought, That he him levit with ane dreidfull thocht. Clariodus was glaid in his intent, And with his fatheris blissing furth is went, Taking his leave at all the companie. He callit on Palexis secreitlie, And said, Deir Cousing, in Ingland quhen ?e wend, In humbill wayis ?e sall doe me commend Unto my Lady, fair Meliades; Unto hir syne present, in secreit wayis, This courche of plesance, saying to hir plaine, Scho wan it at the tornament in Spaine. Depairtit they than from uthar anone; The Earle of Esture is to Ingland gone, Whair he was weill ressavit with the King And all the court; bot quhen they hard telling The perrellous passage of Clariodus, Then they war wofull, sad and dolorus. When Palexis saw tyme convenient, Unto the fair Meliades he went, Saying, Madame, Clariodus the knicht Oft him commendis unto ?our beawtie bricht, And hes ?ow sent this courtch of hie plesance, Of his service to be in rememberance; And bad me [plane] thir wordis to ?ow saine, ?e wan it at the tornament in Spaine. He tauld the laif furth into lang sermoune, How he was gaine to fight with the lyoun. And quhen his lady understude and knew The dreidfull passage that he did persew, Scho fell on groufe upon hir bed adoun With visage wan, and in a deidlie swoune. And quhen that scho owercam, scho gave a cry, Saying, O [wofull] Death I thÃ© defy, What may thy cruell dairt doe me moir paine Nor have him with a cruell lyoun slaine, Whom I luif better nor I do my lyfe! Wha sall thÃ© help, Clariodus, in stryfe, Or thÃ© defend againis that felloun beast? Is this of luif the joy, is this the feast That I sall have for trewth and meinit no mise? Ah! sall I now forgoe my warld blise, That so we sould depairt, aleace, my knicht! The trewthfullest in love, and gentillest wight, Thou was ane that in warld ever I knew; The companie of man for ever adew, Efter the sight of thÃ©, Clariodus, That was so gentill and so gratious. Palexis was abaisit grittumlie, And mikill rewth had of this fair lady; He comfortit hir at all his power and micht, Saying, Madam, doe not ?our self undicht, For, verelie I live in esperance Of his returne with joy and esperance; And gif men see ?ow taking sic pennance, Thay will ilke deime that is not trew perchance. Thus comfortit he this Lady in sum wayis, By sweittest wordis that he could devyse. Clariodus and his fellow all sweith In land of Galice enterit is belyth, And tuike thair ludging in ane fair village Neir quhair this beist did the maist outrage; And as Phebus declynit in the west, Thay soupit them, and bounit syn to rest. The heavinis torch uprysing reid as fire, The birdis sang with courage and desyre, Up raise the mirrie lark with stevin joyous, Up raise anone the fresch Clariodus, And him full gudlie dressit in his weid; He hard ane mess, and glaidlie could him speid Whill he com neir quhair this beast repairit; Then to his feir his mynd [he] thus declairit, My frind, seine battell is bot aventure, And seine that none may be of fortoune sure, Gif heir I sterve be feat or destinie, To frindis me commend for cheritie. Discendit is this Knicht, and left his steid With his squyer, quha oft bad God him speid. He maid ane crose upon him devotlie, Towardis this beist then passit hardilie, Whilk was the strongest lyoun and maist horibill That ever to manis sight was visible; His awfull cluikis was lang and square, Rycht syd and felterit hang his lyart haire; Scharp was his wapounis, and terribill to behald, His terribilnes cannot weil be tauld; Reid was his eine, birnand as ane fyre, He raxit him, and, ramping in his ire, Quhen Clariodus did neir him aproch He rumbischit whill rared everie roch, And lape upone him in ane rage, all woode, For he that day had gottine no bluide. Clariodus him kepit on his speir, The quhilke to him micht do bot litill deire. The Knicht, that of his lyfe was in great doubt, Full michtilie strak at the lyoun stout; Bot this strong lyoun straike at Clariodus So feircelie, and so woundour furious, That he uneis micht defend him still; For with his cluikis, persing wounder fell, He reft from him dispitiouslie his scheild, And skatterit mail?es wyd into the feild, And sair him woundit with his tuskis keine Whill that his bluid ran streimand in the greine. The peple stuide on hillis and on height, Beholding on the lyoun and the knight; Sore war thair heartis quhan thay saw him bleid, Oft praying God him to suckour in neid. Hard was the batell, asper, woode and fell, So long induring that wounder was to tell. Thus faught they still whill it was neir the nicht; Clariodus, him fail?eing was the licht, And that his speir micht him no thing availl, He drew his sword, and sharplie did assaill This dreidfull beist. And quhen the lyoun saw Him with his schort sword, he stuid the weill les aw, And lape at him lyke as he wald him ryfe. Clariodus than straike at him belyve Under the lymbe and upward in the thie, Whair with his sword ane awfull wound maid he. Quhen that this beist saw furth streiming his bluid, He felt him hurt, and ran as he war wod, And to the forrest swiftlie could he found, The sword with him still stikand in his wound. Then wonder wofull was Clariodus, Quhen with his sword [he] was depairtit thus; And as he stuid and sadlie him bethocht, Whither [that] he sould follow him or nocht, So come ane Knicht richt lustie to behold, And him in armis tenderlie did fold; And Sir, he said, [ay] blisit be that day That ?e war borne, sa may I [ever] say; ?e have delyverit me for ever more Of wofull torment, and evill woundis sore. Clariodus, quhen this ferlie can see, He was abaisit, and said, Quhat may this be? The Knicht sayis, I sall ?ow tell or I gone; Bot first ?our woundis I will stanch anone. Alsweith wnarmit was Clariodus; And he with diverse herbis vertewus Stemit his woundis, and stintit the bleiding; Syne said he thus, Sir knicht, but fail?eing, My father was of Portingall ane knicht, And eke my mother was ane lady bricht: To Wairdis then was givin grite credence, Thairfor my mother gart with diligence The Waird Sisteris wait quhen I was borne, To heir quhat waird thay sould lay me beforne; Agreit thay war, and in melancholie Thay wairdit me, gif ane knave chyld war I, That efter I was sevin ?eiris old To be transformit in ane lyoun bold, And so to be ay quhile the nobillest knicht Into this warld under the sunis licht Sould draw my blood in battell or in stour: I have, alleace, done evill abone measoure, Bot now my fault most wickit and proterve All finishit is; quhairfor whill that I sterve, I salbe ?ouris, evin so Chryst me save. The fairest castell in Portugall I have, And greatest lordschip eik in that cuntrie, As it is myne, I geive it ?ow alse frie; Sir Porrus, in Portingal thay me call. I geive ?ow heir ane ring of gold royall; I wald convoy ?ow throw the land glaidlie, Bot I will not cum upon horse quhile I, For my trespas, go pairt of pilgramage. Ather from uther passit his voyage. The Squyer that was with Clariodus Said unto him, My lord, it standis thus; I wald anone be knichtit of ?our hand, I am ane nobill, ?e sall understand, And Guy de la Riviere thay me call, Lord of that ilk my father is at all. Clariodus alsweith then maid him knicht; Syn on thair horsis muntit baith on height, And to the seitie went, quhair baith them met Full monie ane man of micht thair at the ?et, Halsand him with triumph, laud and glorie, Quhilk great joy he fand of his victorie, Unto his Innis dois him convoy; Quhair that his host resavit him with joy, And had him unto ane chalmer him to rest, [And] of his arming doing him devest, As he that werie was with hard fighting, With grivous woundis that war sore ?aiking. For his hurting his host was sore adreid, He causit him to sup and go to bed. On morrow the new maid knicht, Sir Gwy, gart wryte Letters at lenth, in quhilk he gart indyte The maner of the battell, all at right, Betwixt the awfull lyoun and the knicht, And to the King of Galice hes thame send. And quhen this thing was to his Hienes kend, Grit glaid he was, and all his court also; He gart four knichtis furth them dres, and go Clariodus to bring to his presence. The knichtis passit with great diligence Unto the seitie, quhair they met Sir Guy The new maid knicht, and thay full worthilie At him speirit quhair was Clariodus. And he againe to them did answeir thus, He is in his bed, he is ?it werilie, Dreidlie thairof ?e awcht have none ferlie; For had ?e seine him in the stour as I, ?e wald have littell wounderit thocht he ly: Bot I sall see if he awakis ?it, And syn anone ?ow answeir bring of it. He went belyve and tauld to him the cace, How that four knichtis cumin for him was, Unto the Galice King him for to bring. Fra tyme that he had knowledge of this thing Anon he him dressit in his weid. Sir Guy full glaidlie for the knichtis ?eid, And tham allswyth brings into his presence. Thay helsit him all four with reverence, And schew to him, as ?e have hard report, How that the nobill King did him exort To cum to him withoutin tarying. He thaim resavit with great cherisching, Saying, I sall obey the King his will, And wounder glaidlie his bidding sall fulfill. Syn at his host he tuike his leave to wend, And sudanlie did on his horse assend, And raid furth to the Kingis palace richt, And from his horse anone can licht. The knichtis him convoyit to the King. The King wpraise and come to his meiting. Clariodus upon his kneis sat doune, And courteslie did helse his Hie Renoune. The King in armis hes him taine aloft, He thankit him baith heartfullie and oft For slauchter of the lyoun wode and fell; Saying to him, Welcum of knichtheid well, That hes rescoursit my realme with hard fighting, And maid hes of my pepill ransoming; Therefor the third pairt of my realme heir I To ?ow and ?ouris do give perpetually. Clariodus inclynit to the King, Thanking his Heenes into mikill thing; Thus saying, Sir, ?e do me honor more Nor I deservit ever or could; quhairfore, To doe ?ow plesance God gif me grace, In this cuntrie or in sum uther place. The King went to his denner into hall, And on the forsaid foure knichtis gart call, And to ane chalmer Clariodus gart leid, For ?it his woundis war both greine and reid; He gart for leiches all the cuntrie search, And brocht the best [that] men did of reherse, Quhilk schortlie hes taine him into their cuire; He haillit him of his woundis haill and sure. And quhen the King was set to his denneir, Sir Gwy all haill declairit the manneir Betwix the lyoun and Clariodus Of the strong batell wod and furious. The King rycht greatlie wounderit at his taill, Sa did the lords all at the tabill haill. I leave the King thus sitting at his tabill. Clariodus with knichtis honorable Was servit in his chalmer with alkin thing That unto his estait was pertining. So come to him ane great chirurgiane, Be the Kings ordinance his hurts for to sane. This man in sapience was ane maister great; It neidis not all things for to repeit, Bot finallie his woundis beine all seine, The herbe he fand that was laid on tham greine, Quhairof he espyit soune the vertew, Sayand, the herbis kynd he weill knew; He laid it on the wounds againe, but fabill, And said, it hes beine to ?ow profeitable; I pray ?ow be of comfort gud and blyth, With Godis grace ?e sall recover sweith, That ?e may ryde, and on horse armis beir, And for ?our lady breke alse great a speir As ?e have donne in tornament befor; Have nobill curage and be glaid thairfor: Thair still into his bede he gart him ly, And dynit thair with knichtis standing by: When he his woundis had anoyntit all With pretious salves and balmes maist royall, Into his Innis into the toune he went. Richt glaid [then] was the King in his intent, [That] he remainit in his companie, Clariodus, [the] flour of chevalrie. Quhen he had dynit, fra the buird he raise, And glaidlie to Clariodus he gais, Comfortit him with wordis tenderlie; And he againe him thankit courteslie. The King gart send to chalmer for the Queine, And for hir dochter, and uther ladyis scheine; And thay ar cuming at his ordainance, Whome for to se it was ane great plesance. Clariodus hes maid great reverence Unto the Queine, so great of excellence, And wald have ryssine, bot the King wald nocht, So deir he had his bed with bargain bocht: Scho cherisit him, and did him great plesance, His deidis doing greattumlie advance, And doune scho sat upon his bed syde, And with him speiking thair did long abyde. Then said the King unto Clariodus, If it micht make ?ow mirrie and joyous, My dochter sall rycht glaidlie to ?ow sing: Quhairon he said, I pray ?ow ower all thing To sing ane song: the King did hir command; And scho begane anon without demand, And with ane voice that plesant was to heir; Of quhois song Clariodus had gud cheir, So weill scho song it easit him of his noy. Clariodus said to the King, Ma foy, ?it hard I never sic singing to this day, Into na cuntrie, of sa ?oung ane may; For scho was ?it bot sevin ?eiris of age, Thocht nature had put hir in sic curage. Lang tyme remainit thay with Clariodus, To hold him out of thochtis langorus. On this ways daylie, schortlie to indyte, Him visit King, Queine, and ladyis quhyte; And still with him remainit leichis gud, Whyll he was haill of woundis. To conclude, Now leave will I Clariodus heir still, And of ane uther mater speike I will. The four trew fellows of Schir Clariodus In heartis war all sad and dollorus For langour [that] thay could get na tyding Of him thay luifit atoure all eardlie thing. Palexis and his brother Amadoure, Baith day and nicht oppressit with langour, Unto thair uther two brether hes thame drest, Richard de Maiance, Gil?eam de la Forrest, Saying to them, We are accordit thus, We go to pas and seike Clariodus, And ?e two here to remaine with the King, Ay of the court to send us sum tydeing. On this ways beine agreit finallie, Thir two ar passit to the King in hy, And askit leave to pas the said voyage. Thay war grantit with ane blythe visage. Thay tuike thair leave anone at King and Queine, And at Meliades the lustie lady scheine, Quha callit on Palexis secreitlie, Saying, Commend me oft and hertfullie Unto Clariodus, gif ?e him find, And say, sike langour deidlie dois me bind, That gif I hear no tydingis haistilie, Than daith sall me devoure but remedie; And in taikin ?e sall bide him take This heart of gold, quhilk is of culloure blake; Bide him it cullour alse quhyt with plesance, As it is blake with sorrow and pennance. Thay tuike thair leave and to thair horse they went, And speid them fast with travell diligent Whill thay had passit the boundis of Ingland, And then strange cuntries and wyde thay fand, And ever efter Clariodus thay speir, Bot na wit gat thay of him far nor neir; Then war thay wounder wobegone and sad, Deiming sum mischance him happinnit had. When thay had sought him in mony far cuntrie, Thay happinit in ane wode with tries hie, Quhilk for to pas was strange and perrilus, Whair whyllume walkit feir knichtis antrus. Thay two enterit in at the forrest syde, Whair soune thay harde ane litill thame besyd Ane petious cry lamentabill to heir; Then can Palexis at his fellow speir, Heir ?e ?one voice that beine rycht lamentable? Quhat ever it be, to ws it war meritabill To succour at our mycht ?one creature. Then spurrit they with diligence and cure; Then at the last thre knichtis they can sie, The quhilks, with hartis full of crueltie, Ane naikit man hade bunde rycht fellounlie, Wha ceissit never mercie for to cry. Palexis said, Fair Sirs, be ?our leave, That man ?e do murther and mischeve; It is agains the ordour of knichtheid To do sa cruell and sa foule a deid. Thay said anone, The thing that we doe heir ?e can it not remeid on na maneir. Quoth Amadour, ?e sall him leave with us, Or him defend with deidis chevalrus. Thir knichtis thre withouttin wordis mo Rycht cruellie set on the brether two. Palexis hes the formist knicht borne doune, For he was wicht and mekill of renoune, And with the fall his kne baine brake in two. Then the foure knichtis can togider go, And two for two thay fought full fellounlie, And straike at uthar wonder cruellie: Bot lang the battell might not thus induire, For Sir Palexis and worthie Amadure War hardie knichts, and wounder strong in feild As ony micht be helmed wnder scheild; Thir knichtis two behuifit for to die Incontinent, or for to ?oldin be; And quhen they vincust beine aluterlie, Thay askit mercie wonder petiouslie. Palexis said, Than or we grant ?ow grace, ?e mon all thre make aith into this place, That our command ?e trewlie sall fulfill [In] what so ever we ordane ?ow till. Thay grantit this, and swore as thay than said; And than anon thir [twa] brether them bade In Ingland pas to Philipon the King, And unto him ?eild but tarying; And say that Amadur and Palexis ?ow sent unto his excellent nobilnes, Declairing him without dissimulance Of this mater all haill the circumstance. Thay grantit to this ordinance all thrie. The bundine knicht then gart thay lousit be, And gart them also ask him forgivenes, For he was knicht of full great worthienes: And bad ilk knicht thay sould thair namis schaw; Ane of them said, If it lykis ?ow for to knaw, Sir Gault de le Spyne I am but circumstance, My fellow eike height Ame de Plesans, Cardrois de la Resse they call ?on woundit knicht; In Provence cuntrie beine my dwelling rycht, My fellow is of Flanders natioun, The hurt knicht is of Pollis regioun; Ilk ane of ws come honour to conqueir, And pressoners all caucht as ?e sall heir: Within ane myle fra hyne, in ane castell, Dwellis ane knicht wounderfullie cruell, Quhilke is The felloun callit but petie; Ane wyfe he had of wounderfull beawtie; So com ane knicht by rydand upon cace, And revest hes the Lady fair of face; Synsyne all knichtis cumand throw his land He dois them vinquise with his [michty] hand, And garris them sweir to do siclyke as he To uther knichts cuming in his cuntrie, His lady traisting for to have againe; We thre hapinnit with him to be taine, Quhairfor this knicht we tuike in this maneir To save our aithes, traist weill this is no weir; Men callis him The felloune but petie, For sen his Ledie revischt was, never he Did grace nor petie to no creatoure; And he is wicht and hardie over measour; He laikis no thing langing to knichtheid, Saif he is only crwell of his deid. Ather from uther can depairt anone; Syn thir thrie knichtis ar to Ingland gone. When they war weill recoverit of thair sore, To Philipone the King they went but more; [And], as they height, they did them to him ?eild, Schawing how they owercumin war in feild Be Palexis and Amadour in feir: So furth to him declairing the maneir, The King hes them receivit tenderlie, Saying thir wordis to thame standing by, More am I holding to Sir Clariodus And to his cousings bauld and chevalrus In conqueis of my honour and renoune Nor all the knichtis of my regioun. He thame feistit and treitit nobillie, And thame rewairdit wounder michtilie. Thay tuike thair leave, and passit to thair land, Quhen so they hade compleitit thair command. Palexis now and Amadur also War scant two mylis the Kingis castell fro Of Galice, quhair Clariodus beine ?it, For so the cuntrie maid thame for to wite. Thay ludgit in ane toune that heich was wallit, And Joyous to name it was callit. Thair host them tauld how that Clariodus Was interteinit in that cuntrie famous, And how he vinquist had the lyoun strong, With all the proces and circumstancis long; Whairof thay war rycht glaid in thair intent. Airlie in morrow thay in palice went, Whair they met with Sir Guy the new maid knicht. He did them glaidlie welcum at his micht. From them he passit to Clariodus That was in chalmer, saying to him thus, Two knichtis at the ?et ar lichtit doune, Rich woundour fair and gudlie of faschoune; To speike with ?ow ar thair desyris maist. Clariodus than sped him furth in haist, Rycht woundour glaid and joyous of his cheir, For weill he trowit thay war his cussings deir. When he tham saw, he did tham imbrace, And tenderlie tham kissit in that place. Thair cuming than went to the Kingis eare, Whairof he had ane joy, commixt with feare That thay from him sould fetch Clariodus, Whilk in his eyes semit so gratious That he him lovit evin as his awin lyfe. For the two knichtis he sent belyve; And quhen thay war brocht to his presence, Thay salust him with kinglie reverence, And he resavit tham in fair maneir, Saying, Welcum ?e ar my frindis deir; Sumthing I am adread into my heart, That ?e from me Clariodus depairt; And if it be the caus of ?our cuming, ?e sall my heart wnglaid in mikill thing; ?it glaidlie for his saik I sould ?ow love, That this regioun hes brocht from sik unrove; His frinds sall ever welcum be to me So long as I am King of this cuntrie. The lordis them receavit all about, Knichts, Ladyis and all the lustie rout. Clariodus them tuike in secreit wayis, And speirit all the maner and the gyse Of all the court of Ingland how it stude, And of Meliades baith fair and gude; And thay at schort hes tauld him [all] the cace, Bot I no thing rehearse will in this place Of hir luif taikin, quhilk I let owergone. The King unto his denner went anone; And after denner to the feildis went All throw ane meid of flouris redolent; Enlange ane river maid thay thair walking, Whair sum did play and uther sum did sing, Sum rowit furth on galayis on the fluide, Sum beholding on the feildis stude, Sum with his fellow raillit and maid sport, In joy and blisse was all the lustie sort. The King hes gart Clariodus with him go, Sir Palexis and Amadour also, And with his knichtis causit them to gone To pastyme, and to putting of the stone: Bot thay all uthar knichtis did exceid, To quhilke the King soberlie tuike heid; He all considerit and held him still, Whais great wisdome dantit ay his will. Thir brether greatlie commendit of the King, As he them thocht lyke in everie thing Unto thair Eam, Clariodus the gud; It schew full weill that thay war of a blude. Quhen thay had lang disportit in the meid, The King tuike Sir Clariodus and ?eid Unto the palice, saying to him thus, Is it ?our will, my freind Clariodus, That ?our two cusings go and se the Queine, And my dochter, that ?oung of ?eiris beine? Sir, said the Knicht, as lykis to ?our Grace. Then enterit they anon wnto the place, And to the Queinis presence soune thay ?eid, And scho, of ladyes, full of womanheid, Adresit hir and came in thair presence, Whilke mirrour was of bewtie and clemence; With hir was Cader hir ?oung dochter scheine, In ?euth uprysing wounder fair to seine. Unto the nobill princes said the King, Take thir two knichtis into commoning, That new beine cuming, and schort them with plesance. And scho obeyit with humbill reverence. With uther knichts ?oung ladyis did disport; To tell the faschioun it war lang to report. Still at thair pleasance they remainit so Whill tyme was cum supper to go to. When they had souppit and maid rycht merrie cheir They them disportit on this same maneir. When tyme was cum to beddis for to gone, Then everie man went to his bed anone. Four knichtis did Clariodus convoy Unto his chalmer, quhair maid was mekill joy, And coursis came of meitis dalicat, Of michtie wyne, and spycis aureat. Lang quhan they feistit had in this maneir, To bed they went, baith knicht and baicheleir. Devoydit was the chalmer suddenly, Clariodus and his cousings him by; To bed is went all secreit bot them thre; Of diverse thingis speirit at them he, And thay him answerit as he did inquire. Then said Clariodus, My freindis deir, I have beine thinkand on ?our mariagis, ?e sall that be with great lynagis; Amadur, ?e sall have in wadding The lustie sister of the Spanisch King Of Spain?ie land with ?ow to go to bed; And Palexis, my cousing, ?e sall wed The King of Galice dochter to ?our wyfe; Be now content or never in ?our lyfe, It is not lang sen ?e hir saw, trow I. Weill, Sir, quoth they, ?e sport ?ow merrily, What now say ?e of ?our awin wadding. Quod he, That sall I efterwart inbring When ?e beine waddit and to honour brocht; ?ow to displease this mater speik I nocht, And if thairto ?our self be nocht content, Na mair thairof to speike I me assent. Be this Amador fell sound on sleip, The quhilk Palexis persavit and tuike keipe, And this unto Clariodus he said, Meliades, that fresch lustie ?oung maid, As ?e me bad, I gave the [hie] plesance, Declairing hir, with everie circumstance, The maner haill and caus of ?our byding; Bot quhen scho wist that it was suthfast thing, That to the lyoun ?e sould geive battell, Hir bricht cullour soune waxit wan and paill; Scho sounit deidlie, that peitie was to see, In warld micht no ladie more dolour drie: It war ower lang to tell ?ow all the cace, How scho with teiris hir beawtie did deface; Receave this harte of gold inamellit blake, Scho bad ?ow in rememberance it take, And it to make alse quhyt with conforting As it is blake with sorrow and weiping. The heart recevit has Clariodus, And kissit it weill oft, saying thus, Maist fair of wichtis, fairest to praise, Naught may my wits all inewgh suffais ?our Ladyschipe to thanke with humbilnes According to ?our trewth and gentilnes; When sall I doe to ?ow sa great plesance, As ?e for me have sufferit oft pennance? Meliades, wald God now [that] ?e wist That ardant heat, langour and birning thrist On me so sore for langing for ?our presence, Quhilke beine my warldis joy and sufficence. He thus regrating, Palexis sleipit sound Whill Phebus bricht had rune his course around, And schew his face into the orient. Clariodus he raise, and furth he went Unto the King, saying on this maneir, My cousingnis as ?e se ar cum heir For me, that heir hes maid lang sojorning; Now grant me leave to pas unto the King, Whilk speciallie thir knichts hes for me send. Woe was the King quhen verilie he kend, That he no longer with him wald abyde; Then said he thus, Seing it man so betyd That ?e from us neidis mone depairt, I ?ow beseike and pray with all my hart That ?e wald grant at my desyre ane thing. Clariodus said anon to the King, ?e sall me no tyme pray, bot ay command, And I thairto obey sall but demand. The King said thus, Clariodus, Advyse quhat is best and most pretious In my realem, and tak it I ?ow pray; For unto ?ow it salbe readie ay. Then, Sir, said he, seing it be ?our pleasance, That I sall aske efter ?our ordinance, Heir is Palexis, my freind and my cousing, Whom as myself I luif but fain?eing, I aske ?our doughter to him in mariage, If that ?e wald disdaine with our linage For to allay of ?our great gentilnes; And I ane thing sall height ?ow heir dreidles, That he salbe, within ane ?eiris space, Ane crounit king, throw help of Godis grace. Blyth was the King of thir wordis, and said, Clariodus, I hald me weill apayed. This Knicht anone sat doune upon his kne, And thankit him with great humilitie. The King anone has gart be brocht the Queine, And fair Cadar, his lustie dochter scheine. Clariodus hes sent for Palexis. When Amadur and he cummand was, The King said to his dochter on this ways, Heir ar thrie knichtis mikill for to praise, With ane of them if ?e sould waddit be, Whom wald ?e chose, say on, dochter, let see. Thus unto hir he said in his bourding. And scho to him hes so maid answeiring; Of thir knichtis my chose if I sould have, Clariodus I chuse above the leave, [Of knichtis best, sic maik wold I like well.] Then luich the King, and said, Its na mervell Suppose ane elder woman had it said, When ?e, dochter, that beine so ?oung ane maid, Hes chosen him to be ?our paramour. Clariodus than changit his cullour. Now in this mater to be schort, Seing lang it war the proces to report, The King with all his lordis beine advysit, [It was a thing quhilk gretumly they prysit] That Palexis the fresch and nobill knicht Sould wad anon the Kingis dochter bricht; And efter this ane bischop gar thay bring, And handfast them but langer tarying. Clariodus gave hir ane rich coller With gold all set and michtie stonis deir, Togidder with ane diamond bricht, At his depairting, as ane gentill knicht; The officeris and servants in the hall He gave rewardis, and monie giftis royall. The new maid Knicht for?et he nocht, Ane cloath of gold full curiouslie wrocht He gave to him, and uther giftis mo. At King and Queine they tuike thair leave to go, And of the court at everie lord and knicht; Syn towards Ingland tuike thair gaitis rycht With great triumph, honour and commend. So of this first Buike I make ane end. THE SECUND BUIK OF CLARIODUS. Thir Knights ryding towardis their contrie, Out of Ingland quhen thay war jornayis thrie Thay enterit in ane vaill lustie and greine, Throw quhilk thair ran ane seimlie river scheine; On it was maid ane brig with pilleris wight, Whair that on bread ane man micht pas furth right, By quhilk to thame was no readie way; And on the brig alse soune as enterit thay, Ane armit Knicht thay met, with speir in hand, Sayand to them, Fair Siris ?e mone stand, Or ?e ower pas ?e sall have mair adoe. Soberlie said Clariodus him to, What beine the caus that ?e wald stop our way? Then said the Knicht, I sall it to ?ow say; Ane of ?ow thre rycht heir man gif me feild, And if that I him vinquise under scheild, Incontinent ane uthar I sall say, Or ower the brig ?e sal pas on na way. If that it may na uthar wayis be, Then, said Clariodus, cum on thy way to me. Togidder joynis thir knightis of renowne, Thair meiting was baith hard and felloun, And on thair steidis them togidder bair; Thair speiris flew in peissis in the air; Thair bodies met with sik ane michtie force, Quhilk to the eard this Knicht sent man and horse. Clariodus ?it held his sadill still, The uther raise with force and eiger will. Clariodus discendit from his steid, And to this Knicht hardilie he ?eid. They met with awfull swordis scharpe of steill, Full cruellie as can thair heidis feill; They smote at uther as bairis wode and keine, Or as twa rampand lyounis in thair teine, That in thair breists furious was and wode; Endlang thair sydis streimit doune the blude; The rivar dymit with thair dints in ire; Heich from thair helmis the sparkis flew of fyre. Full awfull war thir knichtis to behold, With irefull straikis quhilk micht not be told; Ather from uther feirclie dang the scheild, As alse the mail?eis scatterit in the feild; They hew throw helme, throw habergeone and plait, Whill that thair swordis with bluid war wat. Palexis than and Amadur also Was for thair Eame in heartis wounder woe, Beholding on the michtie campioun, Whilk was in fight alse feirce as ane lyoun, Full mikill of bodie and alse of height, With gyen corpis wounder strong and wicht. So cruell battell had they never seine, They seamit as two dragounis wode and keine; Thay wint thair had not beine sic fighting fell Bot gif it had beine betwix twa feinds of hell. This asper batell wode and wehement Wox tham betwine so scharpe and violent, That long it might not indure nor lest, On ather syd behuifit them to rest; Baith akit was thair armis and thair handis, Thay stand abake and leanit them on thair brandis, And up thay put thair visouris from thair face The air to take, and braith for to purchas. When they had lang tyme them reposit thus, We ar weill restit, said Clariodus, Now let us enter new to our combat. The uther said, Be him that me creat, Thow may weill thinke it is aneuch to thÃ©, It is ane fill and sum pairt mair to me; ?it had I never half sa mikill adoe; I thÃ© beseike that first thow schaw me to Thy name, that I aske for thy knichtheid, Againe or we to new battell proceid; This aske I only for thy nobilnes. The uther said, That dar I doe doubtles, Clariodus to name men dois me call. The Knicht then inclynit law withall, And fra his head his hewmund did unplace, And be the point his sword, with humbill face, He tuike, and to Clariodus he ?eid, Sayand, O flour of armis and of knichtheid, To thÃ© I ?eild me as to the worthiest Knicht Of all this warld, and to the gentilest wicht; And unto him anone his sword he gave, And said, My lord Clariodus, resave My manreid for now and ever mair; I knew ?ow not, quhilk me repentis sair. Clariodus him receaves sweitlie Into his armis, quha thankis him heartfullie. This Knicht him askit forgiveines That he of folie was sa rackles, To fight with him quha rather he sould serve; Sayand, My lord, greate blame I do deserve; I have this long tyme levit wickitlie, Of my trespas I ask God mercie; For throw my cruell lyfe and tyrranie, Men callis me The Felloun but peitie, For Joysa Ramose they war wount me to call, The caus of this I sall ?ow tell at all. He schew him furth the maner les and more Of his lady as ?e have hard before, Fra him how scho was revischit be ane knicht. Clariodus all wnderstud at ryght, Palexis had tauld him ever ilke deale. He said, Sir Knicht, the caus I know full weill, It was me tauld or this quhair that I raid; Thairfor for?et it, sen thair is no remeid For to make cair for it or ?it regrate, Alse fair ane lady ?e may have I waite. He said, Sir, full suith it is that ?e say; Bot of ?our gentilnes I ?ow pray To go with me this nicht to my ludging, For it is now rycht lait in the evining, And far alse to ane uthar harberie place. Clariodus him glaidlie grauntit hes. Now togidder thir Knichtis went in feir Unto this Lordis castell schyning cleir, With courious kirnellis and goldin chainis bricht. [When the varlotis saw The Felloun knicht] Then doune they let the draw brig fall anone; And thay glaidlie ar to the castell gone, Whair that with mikle myrrines and joy The Knichtis to ane chalmer thay convoy, Whilk was arayit wounder pretiouslie With gold, and silk and arais full michtie. When that the supper was alredie dicht, And all to hall went, this said Knicht Unto Clariodus said in this maneir, Ten prissoneris I have with me heir, Whilk for ?our saik full glaidlie salbe fred; And syn he gart them to the hall be led, And bad them say, Clariodus that he Them lousit out of prissoun ransoune fre; And syne anone, dispuil?eit of his hate, Befor thir prissoneris on kneis sate, And askit thame forgivennes everie knicht, Saying, he sould amend at all his micht. Thir wordis he said so lamentabill, The knichtis wox in heartis merciabill, And him forgave with tender imbracing. Clariodus, with rewth to se this thing, The teiris ower his cheikis haillit doun, So pitious was thair meitting and sermoune. When this was done, they all to supper went Of nobill cheir, quhair nought was indigent; Full royallie thay fure with aboundance Of everie thing that might do them plesance. In mides of this supper raise this Knicht, Whilke lord was of this place, and passit rycht Unto ane closit, and with him brocht againe Rose water cleir, doing thir wordis saine, I am callit The Felloun but pitie, For all men speikis of my crueltie; Now think I to leive so vertouslie, That my gud word sall go alse opinlie: Thairfor if it micht please ?our Lordschipis all, From thence Le Fortoun de Amure ?e me call, And I forever renunce all fellonie. Clariodus weill wnderstud the quhy That he the water brocht in coup of gold, With ane new name that he be baptisit wold; Whairfor the coup he held with hand on height, And let the water fall upon the Knicht, Sayand, Le Fortoun de Amouris I thÃ© call; Fra laughter then ilk ane could neer devall; Ane noyis up raise that mirrie was to heir, When he was baptisit on this maneir. When they had soupit with mirrines and joy, Clariodus to chalmer thay did convoy And his two cousingis, quhilk to bed ar gone Whill bricht Phebus on morrow com anone. Rycht as Clariodus anone up rose, Le Fortoun de Amouris to his chalmer gois, And with him brocht baith harneis, scheild and speir, And all that ganit to ane knicht to weir, And tham presentit to Clariodus, First helsing him, than saying to him thus, Sir, brokin ar ?our harnes in sum part, Quhairfor I ?ow beseike with all my heart That ?e wald weir this harnes for my saike. He thankit him, and did the harnes taike, And him inarmit in it lustilie. And eike this Fortoun de Amouris nobillie The ten Knichtis rewairdit on this wyse With ten fair harneissis gudlie to devyse, And ten steidis the best in that cuntrie. When thay rewairdit war on this degrie, Thay thankit him, and tuike thair leave to wend. Clariodus did on his horse ascend Whill it was neir awcht houris in the day, Fortoun de Amouris convoyit him away. The way depairtit of thir Knichtis than, Thay tuike thair leave at uther everilke man. Ane reale rob gave Sir Clariodus To Fortoun de Amouris quhen they pairtit thus. Ather to uther did heartlie them commend, Imbraicing uther, then fra uther wend. And the ten Knichtis on this same maneir, Thair leave hes taine, [and] hamwart went ifeir. Clariodus, thus furth the way ryding, Ane messinger come in his [gait] meitting From fair Meliades his lady deir, Whilk was hir awin varlat Bonvaleir. He was rejosit thairof greatumlie, And him resavit wounder tenderlie. When he had speirit all things as he list, He tuike hir letteris and for joy tham kist; And bad his cousingis ryd befor sumthing, Whill he advysit war with hir wryting. âMy best belovit Knicht, and joy onlie, To ?ow I me commend rycht heartfullie Abone all uther eardlie creature. As I that lang thinkis abone measure, I have sent ?ow this secreit messinger And varlot of my chalmer Bonvaleir In proper persoun with ?ow to speik, [and] se If ?e be blyth, that he may say to me That he ?ow saw, and with ?our self inspak, In mikill thing quhilk will me glaider make. Send wird with him, my Knicht, I ?ow beseike, Of ?our estait, and of ?our weilfair eike. I bad Palexis me to ?ow commend, And eike with him ane writting wald have send War not that alse awtentike beine his saw As ony dyt in letter, as ?e knaw. And for to schaw to ?ow of my estait, ?e have my hart all haill ?ouris, God wait. ?e left me with no weilfair nor plesance, Bot cruell siching, sorrow and pennance: Quhairfor ane thousand tymes I ?ow pray, To visit me in all the heast ?e may; For I may never be in joy perfite Whill I ?ow se, the grund of my delyt. Whairfor, my Knicht and only paramour, I have ?ow sent ane ballat of amour, Beseiking ?ow that freschlie for my saike ?e hald it, seing I did it make. No more as now, bot God that is above Keip ?ow, my Knicht, quhom ower all I love.â When this ballet was red be Sir Clariodus, He was in heart richt blisfull and joyous; He clossit it, and laid it nixt his heart Under his arme, rejoysing him inwart; Syne haistilie efter his fellowis raid, Calling to him Bonvaleir, and thus said, [Of England Court the tydingis tell. And than] Bonvaleir first at the King began, Syne at the Queine, and tauld that thay war glaid, And syne at fair Meliades the maide; Syne of the Court he tauld of everie stait. Be they had speirit all it waxit lait; And fast thay raid quhile they com to the plane Quhair they saw stand ane fair horse it alleane Neir by ane wode, quhair, throw the way richt, Thay raid full fast, for cumand was the nicht; Whair soune thay hard into the wode tham by Ane cairfull voice, lyke to ane manis cry: Unto the voice they sped them haistily, Whair that they saw ane man bundin ly; Twa litill duerffis was sitting him neir, Upon his breist thair sat ane lady cleir With cruell feir, and in hir hand ane knyfe, Saying, False trator, thow sall lose thy lyfe; Heir sall thou sterve all only of my hand, Me may thou not remeid nor [?it] gainstand; Fals theif, I sall me wraike on thÃ© full weill, This knyfis poynt thy dowbill heart sall feill, And eike I sall thy heart heir carve in two, Never me thow sall begyle nor ?it no mo. Clariodus discendit from his horse rycht thair, Seing this cruell Lady, sa merciles fair; He said, Madame, do never that felloun deid, Have rewth and pitie for ?our womanheid; With that he tuike hir in his armis two, And to hir spake fare monie wirdis mo. This Lady, birning in hir crueltie, With tygir mynd, and attrie face to se, Full tyrranlie as feindlie coccatrice, Unto the Knicht scho answeirit on this wyse, Pas on, and intromet ?ow not with me, For at ?our counsall think I never to be, This trator salbe dead, or ellis I. He said, Have patience, O my fair Ladie, And that ?e ar ane woman have in mynd, And never to ane man be so unkynde As him to slay, doing ?our self defame, Bring everlasting reproch to ?our name. Scho said, I winit ?e had beine ane Knicht, And ?e ane preacher ar becumin richt; So furth and in sum paroch church go teache, For heir it helpis ?ow no thing to fleich, He salbe deid, or I myself sall slay. And quhen Clariodus hard hir so say, For lawghter uneis micht [himself] conteine, For scho was as ane lyoun alse keine; And said, Madam, this tyme for my saike ?e salbe gratious; I undertaike, Gif he hes faillit, he sall to ?ow amend, And his offence war to me maid kend. Sir, scho said, I am this Knichtis wyfe, Whom to I have beine trew in all my lyfe, And him I have taine in adulterie As false tratour with ane far worse nor I; For scho is nothing in comparisoun To me, nether in beawtie nor renoune; Think ?e not this ane thing impertinat, That this false tratour, theif and renegat, Defaice sould [thus] ane lady as am I, Quhilk am mair nobill of genealogie Nor he, or ony of his parentille? Think ?e not deid he hes deservit weill? Clariodus began to smyll a litt, And said, Lady, in him lyis all the wyt; Bot ?it for worschip of ?our womanheid, ?e sall have mercie heir of his misdeid; And in tyme cuming, if he to ?ow offend, Menteine I sall ?our quarreland defend. So with fair wordis and with humbilnes, Relaxit he this Knicht that bundin wes, And tham agreit, schortlie for to say, Syne wald his leave have taine and went his way; Bot thay him prayit that nicht to remaine With tham, quhilke he grantit, the suth to saine. This Knicht lape on behind Clariodus, Him gyding hamwart, myrrie and joyous That so had skaipit betuix the bow and string. Clariodus said, How befell this thing, That ?e war with this Lady bundin so? The trewth, he said, I sall not hyd ?ow fro; Scho fand me with ane woman in quyet, And secreit in hir heart it buire full great, And never schew me ane luike of displisance Whill in the wood it happinit thus perchance Me to unarme me, and ly doune to sleipe; To quhilk scho and ?on dwerfis tuike [gude] keip, And on me semblit sleiping as I lay, And band me thus, the suith if I ?ow say; And had not beine ?e come in this cace, I had bein deid, but mercie or but grace: Whairfor not sufficis my wittis all, ?ow for to thanke; bot heir heicht I sall, ?ouris to be for terme of all my lyfe, That hes me succurit from my cruell wyfe. So raid thay furth unto the Knichts palace, Wher they recevit war with great solace; Anone they soupit and maid rycht myrrie cheir, And syne to bedis went they all in feir. Clariodus lay in bed him alone, And quhen his cousingis sleiping war, anone He callit Bonvaleir, and did him say, Go fetch ?e me ane instrument to play Fra ?one ladie; furth went this Bonvaleir, Whilk hes him brocht ane herp with stringis seir; Inke and paper he gart him bring also, And syne commandit him to bed to go, Saying, he had to do sum bissines. He passit furth quhen all men sleiping was, And enterit in ane lustie garth of flouris, And tuike his Ladyis ballet of amouris, And set it on ane note plesant and richt sweit; And quhen it was all finischit and compleit, He sang it with the harpe rycht myrrillie, To heir whilk was ane joyous melodie: When this was doune he begane to wryte, Unto his ladie as followis the indyt. âLodstar of love, and lampe of lustieheid, Blossome of beautie, and rose of gudliheid, Illustar lillie, and leime of my delyt, To ?ow, the fairest flour of collour quhyt, I me commend ane hundreth thowsand syis, Whom in my daith my lyfe and comfort lyis; ?ow thanking ofter nor I can heir report, Of ?our fresch ballat of plesance and comfort, Of ?our tender wryting so winder sweit, Whilke for to heir rejosis all my spreit. Amadure and Palexis baith ifeir Into the court I send with Bonvaleir, And with no wicht I will discoverit be, My heartis Lady, whill that I ?ow se: And speciallie, Madam, I ?ow requyre, If ?e will doe ocht for my desyre, The postrum of your garth ?e gar unclose; To be thair this nicht is my purpose, The tent hour withouttin ony dread, To speike at lasour with ?our Ladyheid, Whom God in gud prosperitie conserve, And in honour quhidder I leif or sterve.â When endit hade Clariodus this thing, To bed he ?eid withoutin tarying. At morne he hard ane mese with gud intent; Syn to the lord that awcht the paleice he went, And quyetlie thir wirdis said him to, For secreit materis that I have adoe, I wald ane chalmer of ?ow borrow heir, Whill that my bissines compleitit ware. The Lord answeirit and said, Not ane only, Bot all my chalmers, house and harberie, Or then I war wyld, wode, or out of mynd, Considdering ?e have beine to me sa kynd. He thankit him; syne to his chalmer went, Saying to thame, Loe this is my intent, To pas to Denmark I have maid ane vow, The caus quhairof I will not schaw as now, Perchance heirefter ?e may have witting. ?e two sall pas in Ingland to the King, And schaw to him that I am haill and feir, And of my jurnay on this maneir; Me recommending on most humbill wyse, [And that full oft, to fair Meliades,] To hir, and eik unto the court ower all; And quhen I may have lasour cum I sall. Heiring this taill, thir knichtis war full wo; Bot, for his great displeasour dread they so, No thing they said, bot rycht at his command They wald obey withouttin mair demand. Then efter callit he on Bonvaleir, Saying, Commend me to my Lady deir, And unto hir ?e say that in schort space, I thinke to se hir fair and gudlie face; Geive hir this letter in ane taikining That I fair weill: and so, at thair depairting, Fyifte florings of gold he gave him thair; And then Bonvaleir tuike [his] leave to fair. His cousignis tuik thair leave with imbracing; And in Palexis hand he did inthring Ane rich flour of lustie diamand, The quhilke bricht was and illuminand; And him commandit in secreit wayes, That he sould geive it to Meliades. Bonvaleir and thir nobill Knichtis two Thair leave hes taine hamwart for to go; Thir Knichtis two did on thair horse ascend, And Bonvaleir hamwart with them wend. Thir Knichtis, with this varlot Bonvaleir, In thair voyage so softlie can them steir Whill they com neir the cuntrie of Ingland. Bonvaleir, to thir Knightis inclynand, Said, I wald ryd before war it ?our will. Thir Knichtis baith consentit him till. Bonvalier haistit him on sike wyse That in schort tyme into the toune he hyis, As for that tyme quhair lugit was the King; Anone also he changit his clothing, As he had not beine fra hame nor absent. Rycht soune unto Meliades he went, And fand hir in hir wairdrope quyetlie, Playand on ane hearpe rycht mirrilie. And quhen scho of Bonvaleir had ane sicht, Greatlie rejosit was this Lady bricht, And hastilie scho speirit of his tyding. And then Bonvaleir, on his kneis sitting. Said, Gud tyding I have to ?ow, Madame; Clariodus the Knicht of mekle fame Commending him unto ?our Ladieheid, And bad me say unto ?ow but dread That in schort tyme he sould ?our beawtie see; And heir ar letteris that he derectit me, And bad me to ?our Hienes them present. Scho them resavit than incontinent, And rede; bot quhen scho had witting Of all his trysting and of his cuming, Thairfor scho tuike sic comfort and plesance, Scho thocht hir heart for joy begouth to dance; Then said to Bonvalier, I have seine ?our letteris, quhilk sum centensis dois conteine, Within few dayis that Clariodus Salbe in this cuntrie heir with ws. Bonvalier said, Madame, sa traist ?e me, That he sall cum quhen he may readie be; He me rewairdit sa michtilie, And alse hes gevin me of gold sa larglie That I sall rich man be for ever moir, I ?ow requyre that ?e him thank thairfore. I sall him thanke, scho said, at his cuming, For ?e have donne ?our pairt in everie thing; Go furth and fetch me Romaryn alswith. At hir command scho com with visage blyth, And said, Madam, with me quhat war ?our will? Tydings, scho said, I have to tell ?ow till; The nobill and worthie Clariodus, my Knicht, Salbe heir, God willing, with ws this nicht. Romaryn answeirit and said, God me save, Those beine the tydandis fainest I wald have. This nicht he cumis, said Meliades, At ten houris but dread on this wayis, In at the gardine postrum thinkis he All privilie to have his entrie; Thairfoir I pray that ?e the postrum keip, So that the tyme [appoynted] we not sleip. Romaryn said, Madame, not this onlie, To keip the postrum, bot I readilie Wald go for ?ow to the warldis end, To bring to purpose quhilk ?e two pretend: Considering that, bot villanie or blame, ?our love to the incressing of ?ow fame, My part I sall sa weill doe to ?ow baith, That it sall never returne to ?ow no skaith. Thir two as now thay spike no more For persaving; Meliades thairfore Unto hir Ladies went hir to disport, Fulfillit with all glaidnes and comfort. To court then cuming was [Sir] Palexis And Amadour, quhilk with all bissines Went to the King, quha full tenderlie Speirit for Clariodus, and quhy That he not cam. And they have answeir maid, Saying, This is the caus of his abaid, He man in Denmark pass for causis seir; Bot he will speid him hame soune to be heir: He bad ws that we sould him recommend Unto ?our Grace, on quhÃ²me he will depend Abone all princes aneth the firmament. The nobill King in heart was not content That cuming was not ?it Clariodus, And baith his cousings com him fra thus. He speirit at them uther tydings new; And they him plainlie all the maner schew Of all the justing and the tornament Of Spaine, and how the praise and loving went All onlie with Clariodus and no mo. And word be word they tauld him also, How that he manfullie vinquist the lyoun, And all the cace they tauld with lang sermoune; And how that with The Felloun but petie He faught, and gart him leave his crueltie. And quhen the King this hard sa great ferlie, He blissit him and said, I trew suithlie, That sic ane Knicht be not in all the warld as he, Of strenth, and nurtur, and magnanimitie. Thir wordis said the King, and bad them go Unto the Queine, and to hir tell also The ferlie thing, quhilk unto him they schew; To quhom they went anone, and did salew Hir nobilnes; and scho maid them to go With hir into ane garding to and fro Whill they had tauld hir all the circumstance, And word be word without dissimulance; Quhilk was to hir ane thing maist mervellous, How that he micht acheive sic acts perrellous. Sir Amadour went walking with the Queine; And Sir Palexis with the Ladie scheine, And said, Madame, Clariodus the Knicht, Oft him commendis unto ?our bewtie bricht, And sendis to ?ow this flour of diament; Saying, Within few dayis in verament He sall ?ow se. Then said Meliades, Sa lang from ws he bydis on sik wyse, I trow the plesance of his awin cuntrie Sall gar this land with him forgottin be. Palexis for to blind scho said this thing, For he nocht wist of Bonvaleiris wryting. Palexis said, For suith Madam I trow, He had rather die than forgettin ?ow; Uneis scho micht from lawghter then contine, And thocht that he knew litill them betwine; Bot weill scho did consider his lawtie, For to his Eame ane gud parte keipit he. Be this was said, the night aprochit neir; The King then dressit him to his suppeir; For joy that cuming war thir knichtis, he Sent for the Queine and Ladies of beawtie, To soup with them that night into the hall. The coursis com with trumpits sound royall; Rycht nobill cheir they had, with aboundance Of dilicat meits and wynis of plesance. When they had soupit and chirit nobillie, And eftir supper dansit mirrilie With joyous play anone and gud disport, The Queine unto hir chalmer went at schort, And with hir went Meliades the bricht, Wha ay thocht on the cuming of hir Knicht. And quhen it did aproch neir the hour, Scho said unto the Ladyis of hir boure That scho was evill disposit, and wald ly Into hir wairdrop that nicht quyetlie. Hir Ladyis hir convoyit to the doure, Quhilk Romaryn closit eftir hir sure. This Lady langer thocht this nicht perfay Nor scho befor had thocht ane moneth day; Whairfor scho gart Romareine go full oft To hir postrum and set hir paissis soft, That naine sould hir heir. So, oft scho past Whill that scho fand him standing at the last; Then scho undid the port full bissilie, And syn kneillit to him full humbillie, Sayand, My Lord, ?e ar full welcum heir. He said, Grand mercie! with ane knichtlie cheir; Bot he wald not hir kiss quhill he had seine His awin Lady, quhilk he avowit beine. When scho the ?et had closit sikerlie They com togidder befor this ?oung Ladie. When he hir saw he sat doun on his kne, Bot ane long tyme ane word not [say] micht he, Nor ?it this Lady, for ower great comforting; Full war thair hearts of blisfull rejosing; Ouercum thay war with love in everie syd, Whilk in thair breistis was so multiplied That they abaisit lang war in this wyse. And unto him first spake Meliades, Welcum my Knicht, welcum my sufficence, Welcum my warldis joy and haill plesance, Welcum my heartis love, Clariodus, Whais lang absence hes beine to me noyous. Then answeirit he and said full courteslie, My heartis Ladie and my joy onlie, How have ?e fairne sen our last depairting? Now fair I weill, quod scho, in everie thing, Sen ?e ar cum, the caus of my weilfair. With that scho strenthit him in hir armis thair, And he also did hir softlie imbrace, And kissit uther oft into that place. This Knycht then besyd hir doun scho sat Upon ane cuschoun of rich velvat. Speikand syne of divers materis of plesance Belonging unto loves observance, My paramour, said fair Meliades, To me it is reveallit in secreit wyse, That ?e sould have beine wadit into Spaine; This jelusie did hote in me remaine; For ever, great love as it dois oft befall, Hot jelusie ower love does dwell at all. Clariodus said, Madam, be not adred, Quhen that the King of Bethingham sall ?ow wed, The King of Spainis sister sall me have, And that salbe rycht suith, sa God me save. And suith it was, of Bethingam the King And hir freindis had spokin of hir wadding; Quhairfor scho leuch, and said, ?e know ?our sell, All is not trew that everie man dois tell. Amongis them thus mirrilie they sporte, They thocht the night to tham was all to schort. Clariodus said, I have ane interpryse To do in armis, quhairfor ?e mon devyse What cullour I sall weir; for if that I Be into reid, then sall I verily Be knowin to all the court in everie steid, For wait ?e weill that long I wore the reid. Then said Meliades in this maneir, Now it is Mayis moneth fair and cleir; Wharfor, according to the seasoun scheine, Convenient war that ?e sould weir the greine. Clariodus hir thankit courteslie Of hir cullour, and said, Madame, glaidlie At ?our command that cullour I sall use For saike of ?ow, and no man to refuse In tournament, in peace, nor ?it in weir, Alse long as I ?our gudlie cullour beir. Ane chaine of gold scho gave him lang and small, With love knotis that cassin war ower all; And bad that he sould weir it for hir saike Abone his geir; quhilk he did wndertake. And he hir gave ane lustie braslet, All wrocht with gold and pretious stonis set; And for his saike he prayit hir to weir it. The day aprocht, quhairof they war effeirit. Romaryn said, It wilbe day alsweith, And thairof war thir lovers nothing blyth; They tuike thair leave at uthers imbracing, With pitious wirdis, and with kissing, With sorrowfull sighing, and with tirie face; Into thair myndis thinking oft, Alleace, That ever thay sould depairt so suddantlie; Assuring uthers with aithes sikerlie Trewth and gude love for ever more to lest. Depairting syne with heartis sore opprest, To the postrum went Clariodus, With sichis sad and heart dolorus; Whom convoyit the Lady Romaryn, And at the postrum did to him inclyne; Whom at he tuike his leave richt courteslie, And thankit hir baith oft and heartfullie Of all hir secreit service donne before, Sayand, He sould think on it evermore. Then stickit scho the postrum privilie, And to hir Ladie com up haistilie, Whair scho hir fand makand ane pitious mone, Hir gudlie face with tearis all wobegone For sorrow of the suddane depairting Of him quhom that scho lovit ower all thing. Bot Romaryn did comfort hir so fast Whill to hir bed scho bounit at the last, Whair scho lay waiking, and thinking on her knicht Whill Phebus schynit in her chalmer bricht; And then scho raise and hir arrayit anone, And with hir Ladies to the Queine is gone. Clariodus, or that [the] sun up schyne, Was at the forsaid knichtis place againe. The portar trowit, for he was ane valiand knicht, He had beine seikand eventures all nicht. To bed he went, and sleipit quhile it was day; And syne he raise and soune did him aray. When he to God had prayit devotlie, And dynit eik, he said full courteslie Unto the Lord, Len me ane servitour That can ane erand doe with bissie cure. The Lord him grantit hes rycht heartfully, And callit on ane servand neir him by, And him betaucht, saying, ?e sall resave This ?our man quhilk I in dewtie have; For he is secreit, wyse and trew in all, Whairfoir to name we Diligence him call; He sall ?our varlot be withoutin dreid, If ?e him list, for tearme of lyfe poseid. Clariodus him thankit reverentlie; This Diligence he hes sent haistilie For diverse things that was convenient For him to weir into [the] tornament; And bad him alse ane browderer him bring, And eike ane armurar that was cuning, And diverse silkis baith greine and uther hew. This Diligence full weill the waris knew; He tuike the money, and went on his erand; And everilk thing, rycht as he did command, He furnischit hes, and bocht into schort space; And brocht with him the workmen to the place Whair that he bade. And then Clariodus Went to the Lord againe, and said him thus, Sir, ane maister of work mon ?e be; Heirefterwart as ?e wald, Sir, charge me; Gar put ?on workmen in sum quyet hous, And se that they be verie laborus Whill thay have maid ane harnes fair and sure; And bid that they with greine satine it cure, Of Tutabone weill all broderit with the floure, For ?onder cumin is ane good broderour; My uther harnes they may as patroun taike, And thay thairby the meitter sall it make. The Knight all undertuike with diligence; Bot he himself wald not cum in presence Of tham that maid his harnes, dread that thay Sould him reveale againe in the tornay. He gart them alse make gounis of satine greine, For men and wemen, gudlie for to seine; The varlots of the place he gart aray Of satine greine all of ane leveray, Imbrowderit with the flour of Tutabon; So that he left not unrewairdit one. Clariodus sex virginis fair to seine Gart all be clothit into satine greine; The ?oungest he gart aray hir lustilie With gold and stonis winder plesandlie; Abone hir tressit hair of delyte Was set ane chaplet all of pearlis quhyt. And sex squyeris he hes gart cleath also In greine satine, with this Madin to go Unto the King. He teichit hir parqueir What scho sould say, as efter ?e sall heir. This Madine richt to Windischore is went, Wher that the King as than was resident, And lichtit at the palice ?et adoune, Whair monie men rycht gudlie of renoune. Four awfull bearis was to the King present, [With quhilk his Knichts sould fight incontinent.] Great prease of pepill com them to behold. This damisell, bot of fyftine ?eiris old, Went throw the preise whill scho com to the King, Whair kneillit doune this gudlie Madine benign; And first scho helsit him and syne the Queine, And then Meliades the lustie ladie scheine; Syne with he voice scho said before them all Thir wordis, that rehearse to ?ow I sall: King Philipon, unto ?our Excellence The Grein Knicht hes me sent with reverence; The quhilk plainlie commandis me to say, Ane tornay set is for ane moneth day Be him, bot heir ane litill ?ow besyde; Gif ony Knicht, that dois with ?ow abyde, Will him assay, he sall resavit be In justing, for those dayes thinkis he Them to assay, if thay will cum him till; And he that is win sall be at the will Of him that straike him doun but let, To quhat prissoun he will him in set. The Grein Knicht beiris the flour of Tutabon, Wha will assay let him cum on anone To joyous Mason not far ?ow fro, Four myllis of space it is and no mo, The Lord of it Sir Pennent hecht dreidles Of La Carere, ane knicht of worthines. When scho had said thir wordis oppinlie, The King and all the court had great ferlie Of hir language, that scho, sa ?oung of age, So nobillie compleitit had hir message. Among the rout great prease was hir to se, So weill arayit, and of so great bewtie. The King said, Lady, I have great joy to heir ?our speache pronuncit with womanlie maneir; And for to se ?our bewtie maist bening, ?our port, ?our cheir, ?our speach and gud having; ?ow and ?our gyding greatlie I commend, And eike the Greine Knicht that ?ow heir send. We ar to him beholdin in great maneir, That hes ws send so gratious ane messinger; If that ?e pleis, ane quhill ?e sall abyd, Whill I speik with thir Knichtis me besyd; Syn ?e sall answeir have and that anone. He with his Knichtis ar to counsall gone. Thay war content and blyth everie Knicht, Consenting at thair power and thair micht To mak them redie to the turnament, Whairon accordit thay with ane consent. Befor the King sat doune ane Knicht, Sir Broun de la Mere hardie and wicht, And askit thair that he the formost day, To just micht enter in the said tornay. The King him grantit; and syne returnit sweith Unto this Virgine so bening and blyth, Saying to the fair Madine, To the Greine Knicht say, He salbe servit all out ane moneth day At his desyre, and thanke him hartfullie That hes ws chargit so honorabillie Unto so nobill ane act and fair disport. Then he delyverit hes this Madine at schort; At quhais passing into rememberance, Ane diamond he gave hir of plesance; The quhilke scho did resave with humbill cheir, And thankit him upon ane fair maneir. This lustie Madine returning haistilie, Hir squyeris ryding lustilie hir by, Syn to Clariodus did hir dres, And tauld him the maner mair and les, How all the court had joy of hir cuming, And how scho was delyverit with the King, And how that hir beheld Meliades, Quhilk was the rose of everie lustines; Abone mesour commending the bewtie Of hir that was so angill lyke to see; And suith it was that ilk Meliades Beheld hir with all cure and bisines, For weill scho wist quhairfra scho was send, The mair scho did unto the Madine attend. Quhen scho had tauld him all the remanent, Clariodus unto Sir Pennent went, And said, ?e mon ane chalmer gar provide, That is of herberie mekill roume and wyde, And gar aray it lustilie and fair, Perchance in it sum strangers sall repair. When this was said, Clariodus furth went, And twa paviliouns lustilie gart upstent Of greine silk wrocht, and in ane large plaine, Ane flicht schot syndrie, the suith if I sould saine, With silkin roppis also of the samine hew; Ane for him self, quhair, of the bricht gold new Inbrowderit was the flour of Tutabone; For his companioun the uther was anone. Within thir twa was ordanit everie thing That langit unto tornay or justing. Be all was put to poynt and dune at rycht The day was gone, and cuming was the nicht; Clariodus his bodie did devest, Syne to his bed he ?eid, him for to rest. The mirrie day displaying in the morrow, The glaid foullis, devoid of nichtis sorrow, With sugarit nots making ane mirrie sound Aganis bricht Phebus blyth ascentioun, Whilk with his asour beamis of delyt Oppinit on bread the tender blomes quhyt, Doing the blossumes breke in the spray, And everilk bank in grein dois he aray. Clariodus, the flour of Mars, his knichts Full lustilie into his weidis him dichts, With knichtlie cheir and curage leoneine, Thinking or Phebus in the wast declyne, That he sould for his soverane Ladyis saike, With speir in hand, ane manlie counter make. When he ane mess had hard, and tane disjune, He gart four gudlie squyeris enter soune Into the Knichtis pail?eon, and that anone Sould with him just; to serve him thay ar gone; Syne ordanit he two virginis that war cleir, By the rein?eis to leid his awin courseir; The Ladie of the place his helme did beir, Hir following foure fresche virginis of effeir; The Lord himself to serve him of his lance; And all in greine arrayit for plesance; His four squyers upon the samine wyse War all in greine, maist gudlie to devyse. Then to his pail?eoun went he spedilie, Inearmit at all poyntis full richlie, On his companioun thair abyding still. He had with him baith trumpit and clarioun chill, Garring await if they saw ony Knicht Cum from the Kingis court enarmit bricht. And be it was of the day houris ten, Againis the sune ane Knicht cumand thai ken, Lucent as lampe and leming in his weid, Withe lance in hand, upon ane snaw quhyt steid; Two knichtis him convoyit nobilly, And gud Sir Amadur raid him by, And uther fyve him for to serve at all; He seimit feirce and strong as ony wall. When he aprochit neir the pail?eoun, The four squyers with rycht bening sermoun Recevit him, and offerit him entrie, And prayit him to licht thair; bot he Wald not licht doune, bot thankis to them ?old. Anone quhen thus Clariodus can behold, Alse suift as falcoun he sprang upon his steid, As glorious angill schyning in his weid; Fret full of stonis radious and licht, All browderit with gold depaintit full bricht, Out throw the greine gudlie to decerne, Whair ilk gilt mail?e glemit as ane sterne; And for the Lady had his helme to beir, Ane false visar for kening he did weir; Hir ladies all, as ?e have hard me say, Convoyit him furth all into greine aray. When that Sir Broun and his fellowis beheld The Greine Knicht cum so nobillie to the feild, Unto his feiris he said that stude him by, ?one is the knichtliest sicht aluterly, And the most gudlie that ever I saw with ey; And so said all the rest of his mein?e. Clariodus threw on his helme anone, Sir Pennent with his speir is to him gone. The trumpits blew and heraldis cryit all, The menstrellis playit with gle angellicall. Thir Knichts as two lampis leiming licht Of aureat splendor schynit as stonis bricht; They smot thair steidis with spuris hardelie, And ran togidder wonder feircelie, Whill that thair schaftis scharp and squaire Flew all in peices abone them in the aire; They tuike new speirris and ran togidder in feir, Full knichtlie com thir men of armis cleir, Girdand so fast as ane fireflochtis glance, Sir Broun on Clariodus brake his lance, And he him hit againe with sic force That he ane speir lenth strake him fra his hors. The Greine Knicht thene returnit to his tent. Four gudlie squyeris to Sir Broun ar went, Sayand, Sir Knicht, the cunand weill ?e knaw, ?e mon to prissoun with on ane law. Sir Broun answeirit and said, Richt weill ?our willis I sall obey everilk deill. They led him to ane prisson of plesance, Be the Greine Knichtis nobill ordinance; Quhilk chalmer was arrayit nobillie, With clothes of gold and arais full michtie. The squyeris said, ?e most heir abyd, Whill we unto our lord the Greine Knicht ryd. The squyeris com unto Clariodus, Quhilk was hame rydand mirrie and joyous Toward the place of Sir Pennent the Knicht; And at the ?ettis quhen he did alicht, They tauld to him all the maner cleir, How they demainit had the prissoneir. Clariodus unto his chalmer went, And him unearmit thair incontinent; Then hes he for Sir Pennent sent belyve, Sayand, Sir Knicht, ?e pas and eike ?our wyfe, And take with ?ow the sex virginis in hy, With other squyeris in ?our companie, And with Sir Broun ?e soupe and make ?ow blyth. Sir Pennent said, It salbe donne alsueith. The Knicht furth went as he commandit was, With all the forsaidis ladyes more and les, And gart bring furth with them ches and tabill, And instrumentis that war delectabill, With herp, and lute, and instruments for to play; And in this chalmer, put in gud aray, They enterit soune, and said on this maneir, Sir, the Greine Knicht hes sent us to ?ow heir, To do ?ow plesance and hold ?ow companie. Sir Broun answeirit and said, I traist gif I Have no worse prissoun nor this I sall not pleine; And so to tell the trewth and not to feine, The fairest man of armis and the best Is the Greine Knicht, and the seimliest That leives now, I trow, under the sone, He seimis nocht lichtlie to be wone. Sir Pennant said, And he is thair withall, The gentilest and the most liberall That ever I knew in the dayis of my lyfe, None lawlier in the world is borne of wyfe. When they had soupit and fairne rycht reallie, Sir Pennent tuike his leive rycht humbillie, And left with him four squyeris that war wyse, In all his deidis to doe him service. When cumin was to court Sir Amadoure, To heir his tydingis the King had great langour, And bad him schaw as he had hard and seine; And he him tauld the veritie all cleine, Richt as it was, dissimuling in no thing; Of quhilk rehearse great mervell had the King, To Amadur saying, halfe as it war in play, Be of gude curage, the morne ?e mon assay. Amadur said, Availl quhat may availl, However it be, the game I sall assaill. The nicht passit, the morrow com alsuith. Sir Amadur, sa sone as day could kyth, Inarmit him and in the close discendit, And fand awcht squyeris that on him dependit, With Sir Palexis and uther knichtis two. Sueith at the King he tuike his leave to go, And raid furth to the place of justing. When the Greine Knicht had of him persaving, He come furth cleir enarmit under scheild, Convoyit with his Ladyis in the feild; Whom on Palexis had great joy to behold, And said, My brother Amadur, be bold, For ?ow befor ?e have alse fair ane Knicht As ever was cled in helme or birnie bricht. When thay war redie on ather syd, Full manlie can thai to uther ryd; They smot thair steidis with spurris haistilie, And ran togidder wounder ferselie, That baith thair speiris abone tnem flew asunder, And baith thair steidis did bakward founder; Thair squyeris did them serve with speiris new, And thay anone raid utheris to persew, Whill all to fruschit thair lansis in the feild, That all men mervellit that about beheld. Palexis said, Gif that Clariodus War in the land, quhilk is unkend to us, I wald say surlie the Greine Knicht war he, He is so lyke to him in all degree. They ran at uther sa withoutin ho, Whill sevin speiris brokine war in two. Weill knew Clariodus, be his valoure, He was his cousing, nobill Amadure, And blyth [he] was that he into him fand Sic strenth, and micht, and deidis valiand. [Clariodus then tuike the auchten speir] Both great and strong, and, in ane knichtlie feir, He drave at him with sik ane feirfull micht, All to the eard he drave baith horse and Knicht With sike ane force, that all that was about Wint that he had beine dead withoutin doubt. The Greine Knicht raid richt unto his tent. The squyeris to Sir Amadur ar went, And speirit if he was hurt, and he said, Nay, Bot he ane littil fruschit was perfay. Thus Amadur [eik] was to prissoune led, Whairof Sir Broun was wounder blyth and glaid, And said, Welcum, [maist] gentill Amadur, That sik compassioun hes on ?our nichbour, That ?e vouchsafe to cum and visit me. Then, smyling, said Sir Amadur, Pardie ?e neid me not to thanke so greatumly, For ?ow to visit aganis my will com I; I ryd heir that we tak no grevance, For of this justing cum the uterance; I traist that we sall get mo companie, Or then I am dissavit verilie. Clariodus [did] pass to his ludging, And him unarmit but tarying, And bad Sir Pennent tak his Ladie bricht, With all hir madinis, and go unto the Knicht, And make him cheir and companie weill more Nor to the uther Knicht was donne before. And they so did with all thair cure and micht, He wantit nocht perteinit to ane knicht. Palexis past and schew unto the King As ?e have hard, and fein?et in no thing. The King studiit, and had great ferlie Of the Greine Knicht, and of his chevalrie. Thus quhen that Amadour was strikin doun, That was ay praissit of sic renoune, Abaisit was this nobill King, and said Unto Palexis, ?on grein Knicht sall degraid Our Knichtis all, bot ?e remeid us fynd; Whairfor ?e sall no langer duell behind, For ay the mair that we thus vinquist be, The mair degraidis it our honestie; ?e ar our comfort nixt Clariodus, Whilk absent is in this great neid from us. Sir, said the nobill and worthie Palexis, I sall againis the Grein Knicht me adres, Although he war ane infernall creatour I dar my bodie againis him aventour Whidder that fortoun be my freind or fa, Thair sall no dreidour bandis me him fra; Although he straik me doun I have no schame, For Knichtis that ar alse worthie of name Befor his speir poynt hes lyine full law, What fault war it thocht with my feiris I faw. At morne as Phebus markit up his face, Palexis did his harneis on him brace, And him enarmit surelie close and joynt. When that he was all readie and at poynt, With him Sir Gil?eam de la Forrest raid, Unto the feild he dressit but abaid; Richard de Maianis, with uther squyeris mo; Thus all on front unto the feild thay go. And quhen he com unto the first pail?eoun, The foure squyers to meit him maid tham boune, And him resavit wonder thankfullie, And treitit him richt fair honorabillie. He thankit them, and wald not with them licht, Bot hovit still abyding the Greine Knicht. Soune this was tauld unto Clariodus, Quhilk [glad] was of his cousing cumand thus; For weill he knew that he was Palexis, Ane Knicht full great of fame and worthines, Brother unto his cousing Amadur, That valiant was for to manteine ane stour, And was in armis his awin fellow deir, Whom he ever lovit weill in all maneir; And he againe him lovit over all thing, Thocht then he had of him no knowledging. The Greine Knicht assendit on his steid, Bricht as Apollo, schyning in his weid. His Lady him convoyit on ane space, Upon his heid he did his bricht helme lace. The Knicht, Sir Pennent, raucht to him a speir, He steirit his coursour with ane knichtlie feir. Gyl?eam de la Forrest, and Richard de Maianis, When they beheld his knichtlie governance, Thay said anone to nobill Palexis, To doe thy devore with courage thÃ© adrese, For of this wyde warld aluterlie, ?onder rydis the flour of chevalrie; And whoso list to se ane gudlie sicht, Let him cum furth and luike upon ?on Knicht. Sir Palexis, that ever was gud at neid, Delyverlie he lansit furth his steid; Nocht better forge could Deame Natur, For he was seimlie of corpis and statur, Lyk to his eame the gud Clariodus. Thir two aprochit to uther thus, Up gois the weirlyke sound of clariouns, Togidder gois thir michtie champiouns With speir set all sadlie into the reist; With manlie heartis baith fordward they preist, And large alse fast as spuris could them speid, And they have met withouttin aw or dreid. Thair speiris flew in peices in the aire, Whill throw the reard the cludis can all to rare, As it had beine ane crake of thunder fell, The castell wall redoundit with the ?ell; Baith hurlit bakward thair steidis with a grane, Whill that the noyse dinlit baith aird and staine. The rumour raise throw all the feild about, Of the two Knichtis haveing mikill doubt That thay sould have fruschit throw the steill With the ilke dasch; bot thay recoverit weill: Also of new two speiris have they hint, And ran togidder as ferce fyre and flynt Whill that the trinschouns ower thair heidis ?eid, And fyr out followit alse reid as ony gleid; They restit never quhile they awcht speiris brake, So them betwine thair was ay rap for rap: As fearce as dragouns wood and violent Thair course had fetchit from the firmament, And breist for breist had met with all thair mane, Whyll with thair fetheris coverit was the plaine; So strawit was the feild thir Knichtis under Of fettering schafts, and trinschouns broke in sunder, That folkis all winderit that about them hovit, That they nocht go from thair steidis behovit. With the last counter thay maid that day, Than to himself can Palexis say, Thow art no man, for be thy force I feill, Thou art ane feind forgit into steill; For never more, sen I could sit on horse, Was I so machit with no manis force. The samine thing thocht Clariodus, And with ane mynd ferce and curagious Ane speir he gripit winder great and wicht, And with sic force he ran upon the Knicht, He drave him and his hors doun togidder, If they wer dead or not, no man could tell quhidder, To grund thay ruschit with sic ane vehemence, All throw his michtie straike and violence; Bot he, throw Godis grace, full weill eschewit; His nobill squyeris him haistilie relevit. Upon the hand he hurt was a lyt, Of quhilk but dread he rekit not ane myt. Clariodus returnit to his tent. Foure of his squyeris unto Palexis went, And did with him as with the uther two, Quhilk full glaidlie schup with them to go. Sir Amadur had joy and great blythnes, Quhen that he saw his brother Palexis; Sir Broun was glaid also of his cuming, And then alsuith they fell in commoning Of the Greine Knicht, and of his [great] valour, His praise, bewtie, his face, and his figoure. Sir Pennent com as thay war speiking thus, Be the cunning of Sir Clariodus; With him he brocht his Lady bricht and scheine, With all the virginis freschlie cled in greine, Harping, singing, and making melodie, With joyous sound of hevinlie menstrellie. Unto Palexis he maid feist far more Nor he did to the uther twa before. This Ladie, quhilke was ane leich wonder gud, Hes stemit of Palexis hand the blude, And maid it to be haill in litill space, As be the Greine Knicht scho commandit was; The quhilke wald [fain] have seine [Sir] Palexis, And his fellowis, to doe them glaidnes, Bot for discovering he wald not wend Whill that his enterpryse was at ane end. The prissoneris remainis into firmance, They feill no thing of sorrow nor penance. Of Palexis went hame the companie, And did the maneir plainlie sertifie Of all the justing word be word; Whairof the guid King thocht bot litill bourd, That prissoneris his Knichts war so caucht Be sic ane stranger to quhom he nothing awcht. When he had hard that Palexis and his hors War baith to grund [thus] strikin with his force, He ferliet greatlie, so did the court all haill, Of the Greine Knicht and of his [great] availl, Saying, Gif that Clariodus in feild And he alse [came] enarmit under scheild, The two best Knichtis in the warld war met. The King said, Sir Gil?eam, do ?our debt, With him the morne ?our strenth ?e mone assay. Then can Gyl?eam de la Forrest say, Full littil or nocht my strenth it may availl Againis his micht, quhen Knichtis did assaill Stronger nor I, and nobiller [of] renoune, And faillit not for to be strikin doune; Bot as my fellowis ?it I sall assay, And sall not faill to do the best I may. Be he had answeirit thus it waxit lait, And unto bedis went hÃ© and law estait. Gil?eam de la Forrest raise up with the day, And at the King tuike leave and went away, And with his squyeris raid to Mason le Joyous; Whom soune persavit Sir Clariodus, Quhilke smartlie hes donne af his false visage, And threw on him his helmet with curage, And with his michtie speir into his hand He met Sir Gil?eam fairlie on the land, And straike him from [his] horse without delay; And syne unto his pail?eoun went his way: To prissoun was he taine, and that anone; His fellowis hamwart to the King ar gone, And tauld how Gil?eam soune was strikin doune, Richt as ane bairne full febill of persoun. The court greatlie mervellit of this thing, Of the Greine Knicht was all thair comoning; So to and fro thay spake quhile it was nicht, And then anone to bed went everilk knicht. Richard de Maianis nixt did him persew, And nixt him Sir Theman de la Hew, Syn straike he doune Sir Tristrame de Beaufort, And efter him Sir Clarius de la Port, Syne vinquist he Sir Cardron de la Con?e, And efter him Sir Leoport de la Gon?e; So furth induring quhile did ane moneth lest, He counterit with ane Knicht ay of the best Whill threttie Knichtis he had strikin doun Of tham that war in court of best renoune. On this ilk moneth in the letter day, The King inquirit of ane squyer or tway, How the last Knight did him impartie. The Knight of Estur lichtit suddanlie, And did assend into the hall anone; Unto the King full glaidlie is he gone. The King resavit him with great blythnes, And so did all the lordis baith mair and les; The Queine and all the ladies did him kis, And him resavit [alse] with mikill blise, As he quho for the commoun profite haill Exerceisand justice had taine great travell. The King him tauld, with everie circumstance, Of the Greine Knight the rule and governance; And all the maner, as ?e heard before, How on the morne he sould just and no more. And quhan the Earle hard of this tyding, How on the morne that it sould taike ending, So lawlie he inclynit to the King, And besought him atoure all uther thing That he wald releive him of his regall micht, Upon the morne to fight with the Greine Knight. The King was laith to grant him his asking, For he the realme had haill in his governing, And thocht, if [that he] had beine strikin doune That nixt himself was greatest of renowne, It had to his realme dishonour more Nor all the rest that vinquist war before: Bot this he him besought so earnistlie, That be na maner he could him it deny; Bot grantit him, and said, If ?e will so, My self with ?ow in companie sall go, [The Quein, and alse the fair Meliades,] With all my house; sa help us Godis grace That we may vinquise upon the letter day. His houshald all commandit he that thay Sould redie make the morne with him to [go] To Joyous Mason a litill space them fro. Now rest I will to speike more of the King Whill I say of Clariodus sum thing. Clariodus hes gart ane varlot go To Windieschor, to fetch him speiris mo. This varlot hard rehearsing in the toun, How that the King at morne sould make him boune To se the justing upon the letter day; Whairfor he sped him hame but mair delay. And quhen he com before Clariodus, He presentit him the speiris, saying thus, My Lord, I hard rehearsing in the toune, The nobill King, with monie bauld barroun, Sall cum the morne the justing for to sie, In all his hee triumph and royaltie; The lustie Queine, and eike hir dochter fair, With monie ane seamlie ladie wilbe thair; Ane Lord is cum unto the court this night, He seimes baith to be wyse and wicht, The morne quhilk hes taine the justing on hand, The governour they call him of Ingland; The King himself he schaipis him to convoy With great triumph of plesance and of joy. I saw the Queine furth at ane windo ly, With monie ane lady and damosell hir by. And thair I saw the fair Meliades, The tender blome of ?outh and lustines, Distein?eand the rest about with hir bewtie; As the day star full of benignitie Surmuntis everie star situat In the illuminus hevinis stellat Scho is the lodstar full of lustines, Of womanheid baith ladie and maistres: My Lord, I trow in trewth had ?e hir seine, That scho schould greatlie [by ?ow] praisit beine. When of this tyding hard Clariodus, In breist he was wonder glaid and joyous, That uneis for glaidnes he micht conteine, Remembering on Meliades the scheine, Quhilk was of bewtie the verie flour and rose; Hir cuming so greatlie did him rejose, Within his breist his heart dancit aloft, Of his fair fortoun thanking God full oft. Unto the varlot for his gud tydings, He gart be gevin fortie French florings; Syne gart he fetch the gud Lord of that place, And of this thing he tauld him all the cace; Commanding him anone to caus be maid, For sight of Lordis, skaffaldis heich and braid On ather half, quhen the justing sould be, Heicher and lower efter thair degree Of nobillis and barrouns on tham sould stand; And efter that to cover them, so ordand, With leves greine, and flouris reid and quheit, And bricht main blossomis bluming with delyt, That na tre salbe seine for leif and floure; Ouerspred with Mayis carpits of verdoure. He ordanit eike two skaffaldis to be maid [In reall stait, and all with purpour claid,] And syne arayit with silkis thair abone And claith of gold, as michtie Mars his throne; The ane he ordanit for the Kings Majestie, Ane uther for the Queinis royaltie And for hir dochter Meliades the bricht. He ordanit eike ane fair hall sould be dicht Of turnour warke, owercled with leves greine, And brightest blossomis that on bewes beine; And bad tham thair all necessaris intake, Heir ane triumphand banquet for to make. Sir Pennent said, My Lord, goe ?ow repose, And I anone sall follow ?our purpose. This forsaid Knicht gart search all the cuntrie, And fetchit thair all workmen that war slee, Wrichtis, and maisters of geometrie, And maist practitioneris of theotrie, Carvors, painters, and subtillest devysers, To make the listis to the interprisers, Quha in that land of cunning was or pryse, Or had ane curious mynd or devyse. Name bot it was in fortrese or in touris, Or in the hall was depaintit lustie flouris, Or in the hinging of the tapestrie, Or in the listis buildit royallie, Was never hard, of so schort provisioun, So curious wark in no regioun. Clariodus went to [his] bed to sleipe, Bot of his Ladie ever in mynd tuke keipe, Now braiding in his dreime for joy, And now escarting for langour and for noy; Now slumbering soft, now braid awaiking, Now siching deip, [and] now for joy singing. How oft in breistis flitis joy and blis, As weill ?e know that lovers beine I wise, Of thame that loves servandis beine alway. Into his bed now musing as he lay, He thocht if that his Father come in field Againest him in armes under scheild, Then that he wald aluterlie forbeir, And not tuich his bodie with ane speir; Bot onlie that he wald his helme unlace, And ?eild him to his Father with bair faice: For certanlie my Author tellis me thus, That wounder wyse was this Clariodus, Richt just and [gude and] mercifull in heart, Having all tyme the dreid of God inwart; Devote he was, and full of humbilnes, Rycht gentill, and repleit with nobilnes; Quhilke maid him forwart ay in all maneir, And lovit with the peple far and neir. Richt as the lustie candill matutine Begouth with cristall visage for to schyne, Befor Aurora, I meine the Morrow star, For bewtie that clippit is Lucifer, Throw persing licht of quhais beimis scheine, Walknit for love the rewthfull Philomen, With angillis voice singand befor the day; Clariodus, quhilk langer sleipe no may, Furth walkit into his mantill and his sarke For bissines, to gar men heast his warke, Quhilk all that nicht had not sleipit with ey, Bot bissie war in labour eydentlie; Craftis men haistit thair wark perfay, The Knicht Sir Pennent standing thame by, Devising thingis maist expedient For honour of his Lord armipotent. Quhen that the worthie, wicht Clariodus About the lists ane quhyle had passit thus, Seing that everie thing was donne aricht, Becaus he litill sleipit had that nicht, He went unto his chalmer and tuike rest Quhill that the prince of planits him up drest; The goldin glemes of gleiting skyis cleir, Did hevinlie in the orient appeir; Up raise bricht Phebus with the morrow soft, Up raise the noise of birdis upon loft, Up raise the nobill King and eike the Queine, Up raise also Meliades the scheine, Up raise the court, and did them all adrese In pretious weidis of great lustines. The Queine did hir aray full richlie, And hir atyrit full pretiouslie; And eike the lustie madin Meliades Into hir heart could na mair joy devise Nor scho had for to go se the justing, To se him that scho did love abone all thing. Quhen of this passage scho was full assurit, With pretious stonis, and rich pearle and purit, Scho did hir fresche and lustilie atyre; Hir schyning hair as [the] bricht gold wyer Hang schyning into gyltine traces cleir, With croun upon hir heid baith rich and deir Set full of roobies and sapheiris blew; Ane fairer princes in all the warld nane knew. The Count of Estur enarmit him rycht anone At all pairtis, save of his helme alone. Quhen they hard mese and syne disjunit, The silver trumpit syne uptunit. For hors they cryit: the King lape on rycht thair, All coverit with his armis gud and fair: The Queine raid in ane chariot on height, All coverit with ane claith of gold full bricht Browderit with pretious stonis and pearlis quhyt, Quhilk to behold it was [ane] great delyte: Ilke in ane chariot raid this ?oung Princes; Of gold and stonis great was the riches About hir schynit freschlie as the day; Two snaw quhyt palfrayes led hir furth the way, With harnisching more nor I can schaw; For gold and stonis micht no man hir knaw; Threttie ladies followit hir weill beseine, Alse bricht of bewtie as the blossume scheine: The Count of Estur ascendit on his steid, With mony ane knicht [attyrit] in fresch weid, Quhilk buire his speiris and with him abaid; With his bricht helme ane Lord before him raid. I let them pase rycht glad and soberly, And of the Greine Knicht [sum thing] speik will I. The Greine Knicht redie was into his tent. The Knicht Sir Pennent ay full bissie went, Putting all things in rule and governance, Great policie he maid at all plesance. When he thocht everie thing was at poynt, That from perfectioun thair was no disjoynt, For Lordis that war dwelling neir thame by He sent for twelf, abuil?eit reallie, For to resave the King with great honour, Quhilk neir aprochit with court of great valour. And or the King com neir the justing place, They micht his minstrellis heir ane long space; Heich was the noyse, and curious was the sound Of talbert, trumpit, and of clarioun. Quhen that the King was cuming neir the feild, He hovit still, and attentivlie beheld The gudlie entres raisit upon heicht, All browderit and depaintit with leves bricht, With gudlie flouris wounder fresche to be seine, The blumes quhyt, and the leves greine, The variant hewis without of purpour thine, With cloath of gold arayit all within, The curious kirnellis ryseing upon heicht Glittering and schyning so winder fair and bricht. Great was the joy thay had on everie syd, For to behold the Greine Knicht as he did ryd. The King said that it was the gudliest sicht, That ever he saw in eard of ony wicht; So said the lordis and knichtis all in feir. The nobill Queine and all the ladies cleir Great joy had him to se on sik ane wyse; And maist of all, the fair Meliades Rejosit was that Knicht for to behold, Whom to hir heart withoutin straike was ?old; To se him ryd so knichtlie in his weid, That love hir sa strein?eit withoutin dreid, That it ane seikness grew about hir heart, That suddant start scho micht it not escart Of Cupidis bow so big againis hir bent, From quhilk ane hundreth awfull dartis went Ilk efter uther, with woundis greine and new, Throw quhais stoundis scho oft changit hew, Almaist hir passioun insusserabill, Amongs them also scho is to sune abill; And efter that scho wald recover a stound, And with sic comfort and great joy abound, That uneis for glaidnes [scho] micht conteine; And thus for love this lusty] Lady beine. Quhen redie war thir nobill Knichtis two, The Kingis herald cryit, Let them go. Full haistilie than rowmit was the feild, And to thair meiting everie man beheld. The Count of Eftur com redie in his geir: And the Greine Knicht anone hes taine his speir; Bot he his helme no way wald let lace, Whairof his felow grit mervell hes; The caus quhairof ?e sall wit efter soune. Anone the trumpits blew a mirrie toune; The Knichtis baith com to so wonder fair, That all men them commendit that war thair. The Grein Knicht softlie did his courser steir; Bot quhen he did aproch his Father neir, Alsweith his lance fourth of his reist he threw, And from his heid his helme he af drew, And to his Father he hes offerit his speir, Saying, with glaidsume visage and with faire, My Lord, I ?eild me to ?ow but straike, So as ?e list of me ?our conquise make. The Count of Estur him beholding thus, And saw it was his sonne Clariodus, Also his speir to grund he caist him fro, And af hes hivit his helme or he wald ho, And in his armis heir he did him brace, And tenderlie him kissit in that place. Great wounder had the peple all about, Upon this thing had ferlie all the rout; Bot quhen they wist it was Clariodus, The clamour raise and noyse mervellous Amongis them, over all baith auld and ?ing, For, certes, they him lovit over all thing, And with ane clamour rysing to the sky, Vive, Vive Clariodus, they cry. The Lordis lape from skaffald heir and thair, And maid him for to licht with freindlie fair; Bot they uneis in armes micht him fang For preise of peple that about him thrang. The nobill King so glaid was this to seine, For joy the teiris ran doune from his eine; Glaid was the Queine, and all hir Ladies eik: Bot maist of all Meliades the meike, Intill hir eyis full plesand was the sicht Of him that was hir servand and hir Knicht, Quhilk conqueist had hir honour and renoune Over all uther Knichts but comparisoun. What sall I of hir joyes to ?ow wryt? I can not have hir gladnes put in dyte. The King discendit from his skaffald thair; So did the Queine, and eik hir dochter fair. Clariodus tham met full courteslie, And on his kneis sat doun full reverentlie, Helsing the King, quho him he tuike up alsweith Up in his armes, and with his visage blyth Him kissit sweitlie, and eik so did the Queine, And syne Meliades that Lady scheine. Lordis and ladies did so about him thrist, Him welcuming, that redlie he no wist Whom to answeir or to thank in thair; Bot ay inclynand with ane visage fair. Quhen knicht and lord, lady and baitcheleir Had him resavit with ane frindlie cheir, Richt courteslie the King he did beseike, And syne the Queine, and the ?oung Ladie eik, To pas and tham repose into the place; Thay grantit him, and went furth with solace; They enterit in the place, and syne anone In ane fair chalmer he maid them for to gone; The Lord syne of the place he gart him bring, And his aquentance thair maid with the King, And with the Queine, and with Meliades. When this was donne, he said upon this wyse Unto the King, Sir, most it ?ow effeiris, To go and louse ?on werie prissoneris; To quhilk the King hes grantit with gud will, The Count of Estur he gart remaine thair still, And eik with him his sone Clariodus, To make the Ladies mirrie and joyous. He enterit in the chalmer of plesance, Whair that the prissoners sould dre thair pennance. Thir nobill Knichtis quhen they saw the King, They war rejosit into mikle thing; Thay did inclyne and did him reverence, Richt as effeirit to his excellence. He speirit of thair fassioun and thair cheir Sen the first tym thay enterit prissoneir; And thay have tauld him all the circumstance Of all thair feisting, and thair great plesance. The King beheld the chalmer then wislie; And seing it arayit so richlie, Espying all thair playing instruments, Thair feisting, and thair plesant abaitments, Thair dancing, singing, with sound of minstrellie, The King said, ?e ar beholdin grittumlie To the Greine Knicht hes ?ow prissoned so, ?e have felt mair of glaidnes nor of wo; Syne them befor Clariodus he brocht, Saying to them, Know ?e the Greine Knicht ocht? How lykis it ?ow ?our taiker, schaw to us? And quhen they saw it was Clariodus, Mirrier Knights war never under the sone; Thair men micht se ane game new begune, Thay did inclyne to him full courteslie, And he imbracit tham full tenderlie; He kissit Amadur and also Pallexis, Quhilk was his cousings of sik nobilnes. The Knichts then deliverit war anone. The King then to the triumph hall is gone, Quhilk browderit was [with] leives and with flours, Richt lustie fair and plesant ower missours. The King commendit it rycht greattumlie, So did the Queine, and eik the ?oung Ladie; The Count of Estur praisit it also. They wosche and to the denner syne did go. To the tabill anone was set the King, The Queine, and eik Meliades the ?ing; At the same burd sat the Earle of Estur. The Merchellis of discretion and nurture Full bissilie went ben and but the hall; At uther buirdis that war collaterall They set the Lordis efter thair degrees, With potent barouns, knichtis, and ladies. And as the first cours com in randound, The mirrie trumpits maid ane mirrie sound; Of clariouns schill, and uther minstrellie, I wist thair was ane hevinlie melodie; The sound out throw the silver mettel thrang, Whill all the grit hall throw the noyise rang. Thair monie diverse course for to declair Ane houris lenth sould occupie and mair, Quhilk neidis not for to be tauld all heire; Great was the feist with hie triumph and cheir. When silence beine of windand minstrellie, And buird beine servit, by and by The luits beine sayit and the strings, The squyeris dansing alway in the springs, The harpis beine sayit at the full To make hearts mirrie that war dull; The guthtrone with triumph did record, The cleare symball with the mirriecord, The dulcat playit also with portative Sad hevie myndis to make exultative; The dulse, base fiddell, with the recordour Assayit war and set at ane missoure; Out of Irland ther was ane clerscheo. [The King begouth to lauch, the Quein also,] And then luich all, and maid grit game, He could not mirrie be that thair was drame; For thair nocht wantit of all warldlie joy That ever had fair Priamus of Troy. The mekill hall was servit far and neir Of rich wynis in goldin coupis cleir. And betwix coursis was ane pad?eane playit, Into play coats they curiouslie war arayit, By great inchanters and subtill magicianis. Sweit singing was of crastiest musicianis, And mirrie dansing of tender virginis quhyt, With plesant stories all of Homer's indyte; And mirrie fabillis of Guido de Colune, Eik was thair synis of pad?eanis playit dumbe. If I sould tell ?ow all the long proces, I sould ?ow irk be surfat of exces; For best is ane discretioun moderat, For everie thing aucht to be temperat. The Kingis heralds larglie cryit aloud, Of gold and silver, and of seimlie schroud, Gevin to them be Sir Clariodus, That was both wicht, wittie, and famous; Quhilk all this quhyle was on his feit standing, For he was maister carver to the King. Bot soune anone he passit af the hall, And tuike with him his prissoneris all; Saying to them, My frindis trest and deire, ?e do me now the plesour I require, That ?e wald gounis weir in suit with me. Thairto full glaidlie can [they] all agre. He gart furth bring to everie man a goune, That at the listis he had strikin doun, Of claith of gold, hevinlie hewit greine, Furrit with mertrix gudlie for to seine. Quhilk gouns he gart make for thame onlie, Of his great wisdome, and his courtasie. To Sir Pennent ane goun gave he also, [And he] himself that day wore ane of tho. With him thay dynit in the chalmer thair, Syne to the hall [thay] all togider fair, Quhair that the King sat [at] his denner still. This lustie sort of Knichtis went him till, And thankit him of his great gentilnes, To thame donne be his passing nobilnes. Of Sir Clariodus of great renoune Then said the King with richt bening sermoune Unto the Count of Estur; Fair cousingne, I weinit our Knichts sould thair ransoum bring, For to have gevin Clariodus ?our sone; Bot to gif them he hes first begune. The Count of Esture [ansuerit] Per mon fay, The nobill Knichtis speikis more largly Anents my sone I wait, nor he hes deservit; Ane greater guerdoun for to have thay servit. Quhen this was donne, thay wosch and said grace, Syne to the floure they went them to solace. On instruments menstrelles playit curiouslie, Lords, knichts, and ladies dansit mirrilie. Be this thair enterit into the hall The sex fair Virgins, lustie, quhite and small, That led the Greine Knight to the justing place; As rose and lillie cullour was thair face; All cled in cloath of silver new and greine Of plesant bewtie, angellyk to seine; With hairis bundin in traces of gold, Schyning full bricht and pleasant to behold; All with greine hatis on thair heidis set, With stainis and pearle michtilie ouerfret; With sex fair Squyers cled in the same cullour Them leading, for to se was great plesoure. First thrie com in, of quhilk the formist had Upon hir hand ane fair sparhalk weill maid; And to the King scho kneillit courteslie, And him presentit the halk delyverlie, Saying, The Greine Knicht hes this halke ?ow send, Doing him hartlie to ?our Grace commend. The King this halk resavit fra the maid, I thanke richt heartlie the Greine Knicht, he said. The uther thre them followit soberlie, Quhilk gave thre leich of hundis beninglie Unto the King, and all war cullourit quhyt. Thus said the formist madine of delyt, The Greine Knicht him commendis to ?our Grace. Then cryit all the court with mirrie face Upon this wayis, Vive Clariodus, Baith wyse and worthie, nobill and gratious! Then begouth menstrellis mirrilie to play, And for to dance ?oung knichtis did assay; Clariodus anone begouth to dance, And fresch Meliades of most plesance, Quhilk tham becam so weill and lustily, Them for to se great joy had standing by; The lordis, ladies, and knichtis in the hall Dansit anone. Thus mirrie maid thay all. When that the dance was ceisit, then the King Clariodus besoght that he wald sing. The quhilk begouth to sing on gudlie wyse The song that he had maid of Meliades; Ane squyer of his him helpit courteslie, Whilk sang the tennour wonder plesandlie. When he had sung it, [then] he tuike delyt, And it into ane role clossit perfite, And put [it] in the hand of his Ladie Without persaving, wonder quyetlie. Meliades glaidlie tuike the sang, And previlie scho in hir slive it thrang; Syne [secreitlie] his hand scho strein?it, thus, Half smyling, saying, Sir, ?e ar perrellous Amongs ladies in companie to stand, That so can thring thir billis in thair hand. All eardlie joy for ane quhile dois bot lest; When his lustie triumph was mirriest The King gart call for horse, and that anone But more delay, for he wald hameuard gone; Sir Pennent he rewairdit moniefold, And held him still as knicht of his houshold; His Ladie fair, and hir sex Virgins scheine, He gart becum in houshold to the Queine. To Windieschoir the King I let furth ryd. Clariodus behind him did abyd For to rewaird the servants of the place, And so he did rycht larglie with solace; Syne followit on the Court quhilk him abaid, And rycht humblie to the King he raid, And thankit him of his magnificence, And eik the Queine of hir great excellence, Quhilk gave thair nobill presence in the hall; Meliades he thankit eik withall. With court royall, thus raid the King furth rycht To Windischore, and thair he did alycht, Whair [that] the supper redie was at all. The King and Queine ar enterit in the hall, And to the tabill [war] set michtilie; And everilk lord of honour, and ladie, War set at supper efter thair degrie, And servit syne with great solemnitie. The King commandit Sir Pennent the Knicht Sould feistit be, and eik his Ladie bricht, And the sex Virgins; quhilk was donne at all. Then menstrallis playit lustilie in the hall. Rycht as thay souppit had and said the grace, So com the Kingis brother Sir Thomas; Him welcumit the King on fair maneir, As ?e sall efter in this proces heir. ?e micht have seine ane richt triumphant thing, Of gudlie knichtis had beine at justing; Bot fra he saw the honnour and the feist, That thair was maid baith more and leist Unto the Count of Estur and Clariodus, He grew in breist haitfull and invyous; And in his mynd with felloune rancour fyrit He hes ane false and feindlie fact conspyrit Agains Clariodus the wicht and wyse, And eike agains his neice Meliades; Quhilk tham engreifit oft in grit maneir, As ?e sall efter in this Treatese heir. The King gart have him to ane chalmer fair, And royallie gart him be feistit thair. When this was donne, the King to chalmer went, With mony earlis, knichtis, and lordis potent, With mekill glaidnes and with solacing, With minstrellis syne, quhair thay did dance and sing Ane weill lang space; syne everie lord anone Hes taine his leive, syne to his Inis is gone. Meliades hir leave hes taine at the Queine, And went to chalmer with hir ladies scheine; And quhen scho was in chalmer quyetlie, With hir awin secrite servants gone onlie, With the advyse and leive of hir maistres, Scho causit dame Romaryn hir adrese To fetch the Lady of Joyous Mason, To make to hir ane mirrie collation. Scho bad the varlot Bonvaleir also That he for Sir Clariodus sould go. Now Romaryn hes donne this Ladie bring, And the sex Virgins plesant and bening; The varlot eik hes brocht Clariodus. Meliades was then in heart joyous, And tham resavit with ane plesant cheir, And with ane sweit and womanlie maneir, Sayand to [Sir] Clariodus hir Knight, Supple me at ?our pouer and ?our micht, This Ladie for to feist, and make gud cheir. He said, Madame, forsuith my commoun wer, For scho hes oft me feistit [weill] for this. Ane banquit than begane with joy and blise. Meliades then tuike hir be the hand With womanlie effeir, doing hir command For to begine the tabill mirrilie; Bot this gud Ladie full of courtesie Excuisit hir to sit so hÃ© at tabill With hir that was a princes honorabill; Bot that micht be no bute scho sat [hir] doune, With Amadour ane Knicht of grit renoune. And eik scho baid, with wordis amiabill, Clariodus to stand besyd the tabill And be ane carvour. To quhilk he did consent. Lower sat uther ladies consequent. Dame Romaryn with twa ladies hir by Servit the tabill winder reverently. Great was the banquit and plesant was the cheir, With mirrie wordis rycht joyous for to heir, With fair effeir and rycht glaid countinance, With easie sichis grundit on plesance, With law demandis of ladies by and by, With sweit love songs and cumlie minstrelly, With secreit blenkis and inwart beholding, With smylling loukis full of cherising, With birning breist of thrist and hote desyre With quhilk ilk wicht stomakit beine in fyre; With all thair plesant drinkis at the tabill, With thrist of love so wode and insatiabill Within thir lovers breistis did abound, Whair Cupids darts had maid monie ane wounde. Thair coursis heir I will not all indyte, I man on neid restraine my pen alite Or be ouer prolixt in my sermoning. When they had long with joy and conforting, So nobillie feistit that lang it war to tell, All up thay raise, ladie and damosell, And rycht demurlie ane dance thay begane, Ane gudlier saw never leiveand man. Efter the dance, begouth they for to sing; Meliades with countenance bening The tribill sang, full angill lyke and cleir, So that it was ane paradice to heir; Ane nobill tennor held Clariodus, The same to heir was hevinlie and joyous. Whill long upon this wayis thay did disporte, The circumstance war long for to reporte. When it was lait, than leave tuike everie wicht, The Ladie kneillit and said, Madam, Gud nicht. Meliades gart bring of rich collour Ane goune of claith of gold of grit valour, And to the Ladie of Joyous Masone It presentit, saying with bening sermone, ?e sall resavein this, gentill Cousingne, And for my saik weir it with glaidening. This Lady kneillit, thanking hir hartfully. Syne gart scho bring the sex Virgins hir by Sex fair gounis of velvot cramosie, With rich arming reversit nobillie. Clariodus rycht glaid was for to se, Of this Ladie the great nobilitie; Hir passing fredome quhen he did espy, He was rejosit wounder grittumly. Thay tuike thair leaves, thair is no mair to say, Sir Clariodus convoyit all the way This Lady to hir chalmer, and anone He tuike his leave and unto bed is gone. At morrow raise all the lordis in feir, And at the Kingis palice did compeire. The feist indurit furth ane monethes space, With singing, dansing, and joy with solace; Syne lordis tuike thair leave and hamewart went In court quhilk war not daylie resident. Sir Pennent tuike his leave with his Ladie, Rewairdit be the King rycht honorabillie, Whom convoyit Clariodus the Knicht, Oft thanking thame with all his wit and micht Of the grit kindnes that he into thame fand; And gart delyver them, but mair demand, Aucht hundereth florings: bot Sir Pennent I wise Was wounder laith for to resavein this; Bot he most neidis resave it with instance Of Sir Clariodus, that nobill Knicht most to advance. Than ather uther imbracit tenderlie, And tuik thair leave rycht fair and courteslie. Kissit the Ladie hes Clariodus, Returning hamwart mirrie and joyous Unto the court, quhair he remainit still, And thair had daylie plesance at his will Of his Ladie, and commoning also. Whairfor thair heartis brocht war out of woe. The Count of Estur tuike his leave to ryd To his cuntrie, ane quhill thair to abyd With his Ladie, to put in governance His landis haill be gud rewle and ordinance. The King I let dwell still at Windieschore, Whill I ?ow tell of new tydingis more, In historie as my Awthor dois assend, And on this wayis the Secund Buike I end. THE THRID BUIK OF CLARIODUS. The King of Cyprus with his court ryding Endlang the strandis, in ane fair morning, Beheld ane schipe with wind and waves dryve, Quhilk on the cost be tempest did aryve, Whairin war marchandis out of Sarisinis land. The King descendit to heir of thair tydand. They schew him that the Caine of Tartarie With fortie thowsand Turkis was redie To enter in his land incontinent, And him persew with weiris vehement; And said, that thay his ordinance had seine, Quhilk on the sea war cumand all bedeine. The King abaissit was [richt] grittumlie, And for his counsall sent he haistilie; And quhan that with his lordis he beine advysit, For his vasselis to send thay have devisit, That thay within fyve dayis sould compeir On thair best wyse, on hors and armour cleir; And to gar provide tounis with victuall, For to withstand his foes that sould assaill. This beand donne, the King and eike the Queine To Bruland went, ane toun with wallis scheine, And thair within providit for ane ?eir. His letters he derectit far and neir In his cuntrie, and wairnit all his leigis In ilk toun to provide for the seigis. Thair com to Bruland be the fyvetine day Awcht thousand speiris in full gud aray; Of quhilkis the King held four thousand still, The uther half they sent the Marches till, To keip the cuntrie endlang the coast. The Kingis will fulfillit ather host. Within schort tyme the Turkis did aryve, And to Bruland aprochit thay belyve, And thair the seige full stronglie thay confirme; The Sowdane with his lordis did determe To have the toune or ever they fra it raid, And thairon grit avoues have thay maid. The King to counsall with his lordis went, And ordanit folkis in guid abuil?ement For to assay the Turkis day by day. The Cyprianis rycht manfullie did assay The Sarasinis full oft with sword and speir, And ischit out on them with awfull feir; On quhais meiting was grit occisioun, On baith the sydis was slauchter rycht felloun. The wird of quhilk com to the reallem of France, Of quhilk the King had [so] grit displesance, Twa thowsand speiris he sent them to support, With his Constabill; quhilk redie maid at schort, And passit [strait] to Cyprus the cuntrie, To Carados ane walled toune by sea, Whilk was ane myle from Bruland and no more, Whair thay on Sarasinis assail?it sore. From France to Ingland com this ilk tyding. When it consavit Philipon the King, He was displeasit [eik] in great maneir, The King of Cyprus was his cousing neir. First with his counsall he did him advyse, Syne to Clariodus upon this wyse He said, ?e ar ane Knicht of nobill fame, Throuchout the warld spargit is ?our name; My brother of Cyprus and eame I mone support, Quhairfoir ?e take with ?ow ane lustie sorte Of men of armis, aucht hundreth that ar wicht, And speid ?ow to the thrist with all ?our micht; For ?e sall capitane be and governour Unto that rout as Knicht of great valoure. Then said Clariodus, I thank ?ow grittumlie, ?our Heines Sir, that me so nobillie List to advance into so heich renoune: Bot I ungainand am; be this resoune, He sould ane lord be of gritter knowlege And wit of weirlie experience and age Nor am I: ?it to take sic thing on hand, Nocht this I say, ?our Heichnes to gainstand; For I no tyme ?our command will refuse, My unsufficience I speke this to excuse. Thair is no bute heirin to speik no more, Clariodus most neidis make thore. The King gart soune his Letters furth adres For knichtis of grit fame and worthines. When that the armie cuming was all cleir, Clariodus, he said, on this maneir, Thir folkis I beteach in ?our keiping, More trusting in ?our wit and governing Nor ony uther Knicht in all my ringne; This companie thairfor I ?ow resigne, Beseikand ?ow tham wyslie to demane, Whill ?e in Ingland visie us againe. With that he did imbrace Clariodus, Taking his leave with wordis pitious; Wha said unto the King, Wald God that I All ?our command sall doe so diligently, Efter my wit and my knowleging, That to ?our Heichnes salbe grit pleasing. With wordis of pitie and of tendernes He tuike his leave this nicht; and did adres Unto the Queine, and tuike his leave humblie; And at Meliades, quhilk secreitlie Bad him, that he sould quyetlie at eve, Unto hir wairdrope cum and take his leave. Meliades unto hir chalmer went, And all hir ladies unto thair bedis sent, Saying, scho was disposit hevilie, Whairfor scho wald that nicht [all] quyetlie Repose hir in hir wardrop at hir ease. This Ladie, quhom na joyes micht appease For the departing of Clariodus, With ane regrating wondour dolorus Adoune scho set hir at hir bed feit, Full sorrowfull, and bristing out of greit, Bedewing all hir gudlie visage faire With teiris bricht, out letting siches sair, As scho that mundane joy [wald ay] denud. Romaryn bad hir be in comfort gud, And preichit hir with wirdis of plesance; Saying, Madame, in heart take no pennance, For ?e sould rather glaid and mirrie be, Considdering that he passis in suplie Of Cristine men, the Sarasinis to resist. All this micht not hir from weiping desist, Bathit in teiris wox hir bricht visage; Scho said, Let be, how sould my wo asswage, When he that is the flour of chivalrie, So luifing me, and I him so tenderlie, Sall pairt from me into so far cuntrie, Nocht witing efter if I sall him se; Now quhat sall wird of me fra he be gone? My heart is deid and cauld lyke ony stone; Ha Romareine, aleace, quhat sall I say, How sould I leive, my heart is all away! Thus weipit scho and waillit pitiouslie, That ony wicht micht rewth have and mercie Hir to behold, or ?it in chalmer be; Thair is no wicht so crewell but pitie, That micht from teiris hold, or ?it conteine Of weiping, fra this Lady he had seine. Softly scho said, Romaryn go espy, Furth at the garding postrum quyetly, If that my Knicht be cumit thair or nocht. This Romaryn hes hir commandement wrocht, And fand him at the ?et, and him resavit; Syne up to wardrope passit unpersavit, [Where that his Ladie lay on couch alone] Deadlie of cheir as in her lyfe war none. Adoune he sat besyd hir on his kne, For love of God, he said, Madame, let be ?our cair and woe, and take to ?ow glaidnes; For out of dread, I have more hevines For sorrow of ?ow nor dowbill of my smert Albeit that daith sould take me be the heart; ?e aucht be glaid, Madame, of this voyage, For all my freindis of this ilk passage, This wait I weill, thay sould it mirrie maik, And sorie be if it I sould forsaike; Quhilk if I had for ony dreid refuisit, Of couardice men wald me have accusit, Than had I beine degradit and unabill To love ane Kingis dochter amiabill. Madam, have mercie on ?our awin woe; Gif ?e no list, aleace, for to do so, For love of God then mercie have on me, That may for pitie not susteine to se The sorowful sicht of ?ow my Ladie sweit. With that the Knicht anone brist out to greit, That he no wirdis mo as then micht speke For inwart wo; it seamit his heart sould breke, So did the swird of sorrow throw it glyd. Thir loveris weiping [so] on everie syd, Ouercum with painis innumerabill, With sighis and sobis uncoverabill Within thair breists, that long they spake na thing, For nather of them could ane word out bring; With hir was nocht, bot ay, Aleace, my Knicht! And he againe, Aleace, my Ladie bricht! And thus thay fure quhile it was neir the day, Than [wakefull] Romaryn did often say, The nicht was fullie gone, [the] day aprochit; Quhilk wird outhrow [baith] thair heartis brochit Scharp as ane lance, quhilk neidit not I weine, For sorrow aneuch was ellis thame betwine. Then said Clariodus, My Lady bricht, Thair is no mair, Fairweill, and have gud nicht; I recommend me to ?our ladyheid, Oft prayand God preserve ?our gudlieheid; Think on my faith, think on my trew service, Think on ?our Knicht. And quhen Meliades Saw no refuge, bot he wald pairt hir fro, In swoune scho fell for inward paine and woe. In armis softlie tuike Clariodus, And with ane cheir full sad and dollorus, On bed hir laid full tenderlie and soft, And with his hands he held hir heid on loft, Beholding on hir gudlie visage cleir, Whairon the rolling teiris did appeare, As bricht dew dropis upon the lillie quhyte; Quhairof the deadlie woe can no man indyt, Nor half the cair of Sir Clariodus; His hard regrat to heir was pitious. With cauld rose water com Romaryn fast, And on hir face and handis did it cast; Bot lang scho lay with deadlie visage greine, That it was rewth and pitie for to seine. And quhen that scho ouircom, scho did up braid, Whair beine my Knicht Clariodus? scho said. Quoth he, My heartis Ladie I am heir, For love of God make now sum better cheir, And think that we sall meit ?it efter this, Quhen we sall have ineuch of joy and blis; My only Ladie traist withoutin dreid, That for ?our saike againe I sall me speid Into all haist; and eik ?e sal beleive, That I so laith am ?ow [thus] for to greive, That lang I sall not byd from ?our presence, For unto me ane death is ?our absence. Forsuith scho said, Clariodus, I trow That of this warld depairts from uther now The trewest lovers, and the maist faithfull eike; And of ane thing my Knight I ?ow beseike, Thocht ?e be far fra me in ane strange ringne, That ?e be neir to me in sweit thinking; And all of sabill salbe myne aray Whill ?e returne, thairfor make no delay; ?e sall have heir of gold ane diamant, When ?e it se of me be memorant. And he gave hir ane rubbie bricht of hew; With that imbracing can thir lovers trew, And kissit utheris with tearis distelling, And so weill long thay stud without speiking. Depairtit thus the Knicht Clariodus, And his Ladie, with sighis dollorus. It sould me vex and eik my auditouris, For to indyte the half of thair dolouris; Furth of the chalmer went this wofull wicht, With sorrowsull teiris blindit was his sight; To the postrum Romaryn him convoyit, And he, that with melancholie was anoyit, Strein?it hir hand and micht na wirds out bring, And to his chalmer went with sair sighing, And upon groufe fell on his bed adoune, Making ane sorrowfull lamentatioun; Quhilk war ouer tedious heir for to rehearse, Quhairfor I will not put it into verse. He tuike na claithis off, he list not to sleip, Bot quhile the day he did compleine and weipe. Romaryn unto hir Ladie went, and said, Madam, take comfort and anon be glaid, ?our Knicht is trew, and will belyve returne As he hes heicht, and will not long sojorne; And furth scho preichit hir ane fair sermoune: Syne in hir bed scho hes hir laid adoune, Whair scho maid ane regrat lamentabill, Whilk to ane bissie mynd is importabill To beir, to aprehend, or to indyte; And eik hir wo me irkis for to wryte, For never quhill scho saw hir Knicht againe Scho dansit, sang, or wore ane hew bot ane, And that was sabill, signe of steidfastnes; For so hir heart was cled with hevines, That scho no list to cum in companie, Bot solitar to walke all quyetlie. As goldin Phebus the bricht illuminar, Ascendit in the orient preclair, And his diurnall course had new begune, Full lustillie up raise this Mars his sone, The flour of armis nixt God armipotent; Clariodus, I meane, full diligent Addressit him at morne to his jurnay, With all the hast and labour that he may. When he had servit God and taine disjune, The trumpits blew to hors ane mirrie tune; He lape on hors, and all his companie; The Court did him convoy rycht honorabillie, With all the nobill folkis of the toun: Thus raid they furth with trumpit and clarioun Whill thay sex myle had him convoyit, Thay tuike thair leave, baith burges and barrnet, And hame returnit to Windischore againe. Clariodus anone the flude hes taine, He schippit in and all the reall sorte, And soune they did arive at Bruland porte; So weill to tham did Eolus his part, Keiping the wind from everie contrair airt, That be the help of him and Neptunus, Withouttin storme or raine tempesteous, Into the port of Carados thay aryve, And from the schipe went unto land belyve; Whom soune persavit hes the garitouris, That in the toune and wallis lay and bouris, And tauld the King of sic ane companie Had in thair port aryvit haistilie. Blyth was the King and glaid, for weill he wist That they war freindis, his foes to resist. When the grit Constabill of France hard tyding Of Sir Clariodus suddant aryveing, Rycht glaid he was, for divers to him schew Of his valiant deidis and his vertew; Whairfor on hors ascendit he anone, And diverse lordis maid with him to gone, And with grit honour met Clariodus, With knichtis valiant and verteous, Saying, That he was welcum in that land: And ather hes taine uther be the hand, And tenderlie maid thair aquentance; Syne to the toune returnit with plesance, And royallie in at the portis raid. The Frensch Constabill hes grit instance maid Unto Clariodus, with him to go To supper, and his tender cousingis two; He grantit him, and baid his companie, The fairest luging and the maist gudlie Of all the toun, and thair harberie take; Foure louetennents thairefter gart he make, To put his folkis in rewle and governance; To supper syne thay passit with plesance. And so among all uther commoning, He speirit of the tounis beseiging; And syne of thame within and thair defence, And of the Cainis hÃ© magnificence, Of everilke skirmage and new debait Of Cyprianis and of Saraseinis of lait. The Constabill utart everie thing at richt, Wha wan the feild, and quha was put to flicht. Whilk commoning was plesant and joyous Unto the heiring of Sir Clariodus, Wha tuike his leave when the supper was done, And to his folkis haistit him full soune, And bad them all be readie be the day, Inarmit weill, and into gud aray, For he wald let them wit of his cuming. Thay grantit glaidlie all to his biding. Clariodus reposit him that nicht, And on the morne, be the day waxit licht, He ischit furth with all his companie, Enarmit at all peices nobillie, And on the Heathine host full hardilie He maid ane haistie onset, with ane cry, The mightie God namand upon height; With that they ruschit on them with sic micht Throuchout the host alsweith raise the affray, For thay war taine all out of [gud] aray. Our Cristine men so fearcelie them assaillit, That baith in strenth and hardiment thay faillit. Bot throw the bugills and the clariouns soundis, Returnit all this false heard of Mahoundis, And cruellie set on Clariodus: Bot he, that was both wyse and chevalrus, Loude his ansein?e he did among them cry, And with his hÃ© renownit companie, With speiris scharp so manlie with them delt, Whill monie of thame anone the deid hes felt; Of quhilk up raise the clamour and the sound, That all the wallis rang of Bruland toun, And all the toun of Carrados also; The King himself unto the wallis did go, The Constabill of France with monie knicht. Be this the day upcleirit and wox licht, Whair thay micht weill behold the battell, Wha did defend, and wha did best assaill. Ferce was the fight, and awful for to se, On ather syd thair was bot Do or die. Clariodus with michtie speir in hand Assail?eit so, no man micht him gainstand, Bot ather man or hors ?eid to the eard, Among the Heathen so manlie he him steird. When monie ane speir he brokin had asunder, He drew his sword, and focht that it was wonder Him to behold, quhilk as ane lyoun wod Never seicit to sched his foes bluid. Befor his face, loe, heir ane knicht goes doun, And thair ane uther lyis into swoune, The thrid on arsoun gapis as he war deid, Fra sum he carves the arme, and sum the heid, That of his deidis grite plesour had the King, And so had all the peple auld and ?ing. The French Constabill persavit everilk deill, How no helme micht gainstand his brand of steill, And how the Heathin he huntit to and fro, Howbeit thay war fighteris monie mo, Saying, He wenit into threttie knichts Had never beine the curage nor the michts, That he saw into that Knicht that day. His hÃ© honour on all sydis praisit thay. Ane Heathin Knicht that was of maist renoune On Saraseinis syd, prysit ane champioun, That to the Caine was verie neir cousigne, Quick throw the thikest of the preise did thring, And set upon Clariodus the gud; He, as [ane] lyoun, asper, feirce and wod, Ane speir recoverit [lyand] neir him by, And met the Knicht so wonder feircelie, And so him raife all throuch the bodie out, That to the eard he duschit doun but doubt. With that on height he cryit on his ansin?e, And he, quhom that no Turkis micht derein?e, Set on them new with all his companie With so grit curage and so hardilie, And cryit upon the Heathine with ane schout, And with thair steillit brandis that war stout, Thay said thair sydis for till sow full saire, And dang thame doune in draves heir and thair, Whill all the feilds with deid bodies war spred, And all the Heathinis gave thair bake and fled. Be that the nicht aprochit was and neir, That skantlie men as than micht know thair feir; Quhairfor he left the chase as [for] that nicht, And enterit in the toune with wallis wicht Of Carados againe to his luging. The Constabill with folkis auld and ?ing, Of all the toune him met triumphantlie, [Who had that day behavd so valiantlie,] Him welcuming with nobill feist and cheir, Being to the toun convoyit on blyth maneir. The fair begining maid Clariodus Upon the Heathene, that was utragius; Whome I leave in the weiris on this wayis, And speike I will of fair Meliades. Quhen it was manifest to this trator Knight, The Kingis brother, full of fraud and slicht, How that Clariodus with ane armie In Cyprus land was [thus] in chevalrie, The Count of Estur home to his cuntrie Was went also, his barnage for to see, He fein?it letteris of his awin indyte, Throw his [foull] invy, malice and dispyte, As they had cumit from Clariodus Unto the Kingis dochter, beiring thus, That scho the King sould poysoun presentlie, That thay the cuntrie micht posseid thairby. Quhilk letteris in a bag they had bein closit, And with ane mynd wonder evill disposit, Unto the King he went in secreit wayis; The Queine intill ane uther chalmer lyis Richt weill at ease, and wist nocht of this thing. This tratour Knicht hes schawin to the King, That Sir Clariodus had letters sent Unto his dochter Meliades the gent, To poysoune him, that thay micht be his airis; And so the tressoun furth to him declairis, And schew him furth thir letteris oppinlie, That he himself had dyttit traitourouslie, And said, that in ane taverne quhair he lay, Ane messinger thair ludgit in the way, And in his drukinnes, as did befall, Out of his bulgit schuik his letters all; Ane varlot of the taverne thame up tuike, And brocht them me upon the morne to luike, And of this mater of me he was so red [When of the letters I him questioned] He him absentit and hes fled away; Quhairfor in hast, without ony mair delay, I com to warne ?ow of this false treasoun. The King him trowit, and without reasoun, For hastilie credit he wald gif all tyme, An war it anents never so grit ane cryme, Quhilk is ane fault full grit into ane King; He braid unto his sword, rycht haistining, And wald have went his dochter for to sla. This tratour wist if he went out sa, That redderis sould have maid impediment, For all hir lovit that upon hir blent. Na, Sir, he said, my counsall ?e sall doe, Sum burriouris ?e sall gar cum ?ow to, And tham command to worke at my bidding, And I sall caus but ony persaving, That scho be taine and slaine without the toun, And thus sall endit be hir false treasoun; I taike on me to taike him efterwart, And of sik justice gif to him his part. The King neir wode in his melancholie, Hes gart be brocht thir murtherers in hy, And them commandit under all heist paine, That his ane dochter sould with thame be slaine, That litill wist, aleace, of this mater, For paine inewch was at hir heart full neir For the lang absence of Clariodus. This traitour Knicht hes furth delyverit thus, And went to the chalmer of Meliades, And cryit furth on hir this hastie wayis Unto the King. And scho but mair abaid Obayit him, and on hir kne abraid, Sum deill affrayit, furth scho did hir marke In treases with hir kirtill and hir sarke, For scho was ay obedient, meike and wyse, And beningne alse, as heart could [eer] devyse, Trusting hir father had beine at sum malice; My deirest on, scho said, quhat may ?ow pleis? The King, he said, wald speike with ?ow allone. He wald not let Romaryn with hir gone. And quhen, aleace, thistender innocent, Thus with hir Eame throw the hall is went, He hir delyverit hes or he wald stint To the murderer, quhilk haistilie hir hint On felloun wayis, rycht rudlie with rusching, Nocht handillit as the dochter of a King, Bot as trespassour with awfull cheir and schore; Hir tender bonis thay stronglit all so sore Scho wald have cryit; bot scho micht not, alleace, So with hir courtche they wompillit all hir face, Stopping hir mouth so hard and cruellie [That] scho micht uneis draw hir breath gudlie: So furth at ane privie postrum hir led Suiftlie to ane forrest as the traitour bad, To murther hir quhar na man micht tham se. Ah! be this warldis instabilitie Wha sould in riches or hie estate beleive, Sen nane the chance of fortoune [can] echeve! Hir variance and unstabillitie Alyke is redie to heich and law degre; For febilnes oft cumis efter micht, And efter dayis cumis the dewlie nicht, And oft tymis joy cumis efter sorrow and caire, And efter winter cumis the sumer fair; Throw wyldnes of [the] frostis and of haill, Murnis full oft the merie nichtingall, And blythlie singis on the ilk branch againe Quhair scho befor had weipit hard for paine: So men full oft throw walth and grite riches Fallis in povertie and in febilnes, Whom efter fortoune glaidlie dois restore To mair honour nor ever thay war before; And ?it thairefter slydis doune fra hir quheill, From weill to woe, and syne from wo to weill. This transitorie joy it micht not lest, Heir is no ease bot trubill and unrest; For alse unsiker is heir ?our dwelling, All changing is our joy fra abyding. Schir Thomas is returnit to the King, And said, Be glaid, Sir, take gud conforting, ?e ar delyverit weill and hastilie Of ?one wickit and deidlie enemie, I thinke to delyver ?ow eik also Of him that is the worker of this wo; ?e sall the morne gar call to ?ow the Queine, And all ?our maist familiaris bedeine, And schaw to them the cace how it is went; And gif that thay be not thairwith content, ?e sall them punisch as it weill effeiris, Sen that ?e know the danger that appeiris. When this was donne he passit to his bed, Thinkand that he his purpose weill had sped. The King, in his melancolike passioun, The nicht all ower turnit up and doune, And in his breist ay wirking to and fro This suddane vengance and [alse] haistie wo Upon his dochter and himself in eike, For sake of hir that seamit wyse and meike, And syne so sweit and fair ane creature, And so weill taught and lovit abone measoure, And was his only bairne withoutin mo; Unsufferabill was his paine and wo For his awin chyld of fatherlie pitie, That scho the caus of sic ane treasoune be. Romarein trowit, that scho so long abaid, The King in tender commoning hir had Of plesand materis, so that scho thocht not lang; And this scho thocht, aleace, scho thocht all wrang, It was not so, it was the more pitie, Scho being of so wounderfull bewtie. Upon the morne the King sent for the Queine, And tauld hir of Meliades the scheine, And quhat was wrocht; thair is no mair to tell, With pitious cry scho to the eard doun fell In swouning cauld, and with ane deidlie face, And of hir ladies oft was the Aleace! Then nobill knichts with wofull heartis ran, And held hir up with visage paill and wan. When this is knowin in castell and in toun, The clamour raise with lamentatioun Amongis the pepill, with hiddious noyis and beir [For sake of her, that was their Princess deir,] Them selfs demainand that pitie was to see, Wringand thair handis, and cryand for pitie, Beitting thair breistis and face sorowfullie, And tormenting them selfs without mercie. No wofuller in Troy raise up the soun, For Hectoris daith, thair mightie champioun; Nor quhen the Greikis enterit in thair ire In ower thair wallis, and set thair toun on fyre, And slew Priam, and brint Paladeon, Nor was into the court of Philipon, With lamentatioun, and with sorrowfull cry, For hir that was the richt lodstar and gy Of vertew, bewtie, and of gentilnes, Fredome, renoune, honour, and nobilnes. Wo worth the King, thay cry, and his counsell, Doing this deid so wickit and cruell, Quhilk sall this realme turne to distructioun By the vengence that sall from hevine stryke doun Upon [thir] wretchis for the blood saikles Of hir that in all vertew stude maikles Into this wyde warld without comparisoun; Fy on the murtherers! fy on the false trasoun! Fy on the cruell daith for ever more! The skaith is done that no man may restore. Bot had it beine kend to the pepill thair, How that Sir Thomas kindlit had thair cair, He hade beine rent thair with ane thowsand handis, That ?it the mater na thing understandis. Romaryn rave hir hair out with hir neives, And with hir cairfull voice the court scho deives, Smyting hir face that sorow was to se. Now of this lamentatioun let I be, And speik I will of fair Meliades, How that scho was demainit, and quhat wayis. When that thir four murthereris anone War with the Ladie to the forrest gone, And had hir brocht unto the samine steide, Whair [that] they thought to put hir to [the] deid, Thay said, Ladie, richt heir mone ?e die; Hir countinance than pitie was to se; Trembling for dreid, abaisit of hir cheir, With quaiking voice scho said, My frindis deir, Why sould I die? Have ?e that in command? What have I donne? Thay said, without demand We wait no caus, but we commandit ar To slay ?ow heir, dreidles we want no mair. Then fell scho on growse richt pitiouslie Befor thir murthereris, asking ay mercie Full rewthfullie, with lamentabill voice, For love of Jesus that diet on the crose, With ?our waponis have pitie me to ding, Thinke that I am the dochter of a King, Let manlie pitie enter in ?our hearts, To doe to me, ane sillie woman, smarts, And thinke that of ane woman ?e war borne; Mercie, for him that wore the croune of thorne, Of me, alleace, that may ?ow not gainstand, That now ?our scharpe swordis hes in [?our] hand. Thay said, No buite is for to carpin so, We mone our selfs be slaine or ellis ?ow slo. Then towart hir they went with awfull fair. Now grant me this, scho said, I aske no mair, Let me heir to God do my oratioun, Syne this mone be my last devotioun. Go speid ?ow soune, quoth thay, and tarie nocht. Alleace, hir spirit than was all on flaucht. Doune on hir kneis scho sat full humbillie, Quaiking as aspe, and schaiking pitiouslie, For dreid of daith asrayit out of measure Fra that scho saw [that] thair was no favour. Scho said, O Lord, that sittis in hevinis hÃ©, Of mercie King, thow mercie have on me; As thow disdainit for me thy creature To licht into the glorious virgine pure, And sufferit for me deidlie woundis fyve, And raise upon the third day [syne] to lyve, And syne asscendit to the hevinis with glore, Thow grant me this that meikle I implore; As I am innocent of this mateir, Have mercie on me, Lord, I thÃ© require, And save me from thir tormentouris fell, Quhilk in this wood with waponis wald me quell. When scho had prayit lang upon this wyse, To God scho hir betaught, and syne did ryse; Syn to hir tormentouris scho did returne: And thay that hard hir praying thus and murne, And hard hir pitious lamentatioun, Hir bening wordis and hir orisoun, Weill knew of gylt that scho was all saikles; Whairfor they rewit on hir hevines; They went altogither, and was advysit To banisch hir, quhilk soune they have devisit, And thocht thay wald hir nocht saikleslie slo; And, thus according, [unto] hir they goe: And scho, that weinit to have bein deid anone, Fell into swound alse cauld as ony stone; And quhen scho overcome, scho cryit Mercie: Thay said, Lady, for rewth we will apply To save ?our lyfe, bot ?e sall banischit be; For verilie we think it grit pitie, To slay ane Ladie of so grit bewtie. Scho thankit them on kneis heartfullie, And with hir armis small thair legs imbract, And height to take the sea in all heast, Saying, Fair siris, I may ?ow never aquite, That me to leive hes grantit sik respite; Rewardis I have none to give ?ow heir, Sic as I have sik sall ?e have but weir; Scho hir denudit of hir vestur thair, And left no thing upon hir bodie faire Except hir sark bot scho to them it gave; Thay neidit nothing at hir [for] to crave, For scho them frelie offerit but disdaine All that scho tursit, but hir litill chaine. When this was donne thay to toun tham adresst; And scho in middes of the wyld forrest Full waine of wemen was left hir alone; Hir visage was all [weit and] wobegone, In sarke allone, withoutin cloathes moe, At midnicht mirke, and wist not quhair to go. To Shir Thomas thay turnit hame againe, And tauld him that the Ladie thay had slaine. With wordis fair so flatterit he the King, He was content quhen he hard this tyding; The auld servandis haill he gart remove, That to the King [leill] favour had or love; Whom he suspectit gart banisch furth totell, And quhom he lovit thay still in Court did dwell: So be his wickit wayis of trasoune, He brocht this realme neir to confusioun. He dreid the Count of Esturis ham cuming; Quhairfor he sent to him but tarying Counterfute letters upon the Kingis name, That he sould dwell in his cuntrie at hame Ay quhill he send to him ane wryting [cleir,] Or ellis that he sould cum on no maneir. This Lady naikit in the wood allone Full pitiouslie did weipe and make hir mone, Beseikand God to send hir help and grace To schape out of that dreidfull wildernes. Scho passit furth and wist not quhair to go, Into the wood ay turnand to and fro Forward and bakward amongs the thornis keine Whill all to rent on breeris hir sarke beine; And quhen scho hard ocht steiring hir besyde Into ane busch full darne scho wald hir hyde, Quaiking for dreid that folk sould hir espy And murther hir, alleace, scho wist not quhy; Whyllis scho wald ly still and tak [gude] keip, And uther quhyllis out throw the hedgis creipe, Whill that hir hyd as lustie lillie quhyt, Whairon to luike was sumtyme grite delyte, Was all to rent and carvin heir and thair With thornie pikis wounding hir full sair; Hir tender hyd and [lustie] snow quhyt skine, As Mayis blossome, smoth, [and] quhyt and thine, Was all depaint, allace, of reid cullour, As mixteoun of rose and lillie flour, Throw blood that was [from] hir bodie berest, As scho with scurgis had beine all to best. That nicht scho passit with so grit pennence, Praying to God with bening sufference. And be the morrow cleirit up alyte, Out of the forrest scho was passit quite; Then went scho furth in warld scho wist no quhair, Whill that for fault of meit scho hungerit sair. Syne of ane litill hous scho gat ane sight, To quhilk scho did hir speid with all hir might, Whair scho ane woman fand, to quhome scho said, Fair dame, for love of that ilk blissit maid, That bure the birth that sufferit for us deid, Refresch me with ane litill peice of breid, And gif me of ?our almous for to eit, That am in poynt to swone for want of meit. This woman was bot rud of conditioun, And hir beheld so maiglit up and doune, Scho said, Evill woman fra my dore ?e go, And ask them meit that thÃ© demainit so. Then weipit scho that was full will of reid, And furth scho past, asking of God remeid. Richt far scho went and saw na kynd of toune, For fault of foude scho was in poynt to swone; Febill scho wox, and full of hevines, That had beine in rest with all tendernes; Be surfute of travell and hir grit rebute, Quhilk was not wonit to gang upon hir fute, Hir tyrrit lymis no farther micht hir beir; Whairfor in heart scho had full mikle feare. Bot, as God wald, ane uther hous scho saw, And as scho micht scho towardis it could draw, And fand the gudwyfe standing in the dore; Scho said, Have mercie on me ane woman pure, That far hes gaine without cloathis or fude; For love of him that stervit on the rude, ?e me refresch with sum pairt of ?our meit, As I that hungrie am and faine wald eit. This woman was in heart merciabill; When scho had hard hir wordis lamentabill, Scho hir beheld that fair was for to se, Replenischit with wonderfull bewtie, Hir plesant port, hir sweit and louesum face, Hir bricht hairis wyde wavelling out of lace, Hir snow quhyt face with bloud all reid depaint, Hir self so made, so weirie and so faint, Hir lustie visage all with teiris weite, As bricht dew dropis on the lillie sweit; So sore with mercie hir heart was owercum Hir to behold weiping so allone, Scho grat for rewth, and tuike hir in hir hous, Saying, My doghter how hes it happinit thus? I trow sum folk that hes beine evill advisit, For ?our grit bewtie hes ?ow thus supprysit. Nay, said this Ladie, traist ?ow verilie, That I am undeflorit of my bodie Of all filthines or sic corruptioun; Fair dame, have mercie on my infortoun, And schaw me how my leving I sall wine, And quhat labour first I sall [to] begyne; I wald doe service faine for my living, And sall be leill, doubt ?e na uther thing. Ane peice of gray breid the wyfe hes to hir brocht, The quhilke to eate [scho] wounder gud it thocht, That breid of maine to hir was never so sweit, Quhilk plesantlie scho tuike and [soon did] eate: Ane drinke of water than to hir scho gave, Saying, My dochter, so mote God me save, I wald wisch ?ow unto sum gud maistres, Bot ane poure woman is myself doubtles, I may ?ow not susteine [long] heir with me; I have ane cummer dwelling by the sea, That deallis with marchandice and hes riches, And mister hes of servantes as I ges, I traist scho sall resave ?ow in service; Scho is alse full of vertew and gentrice: Bot ?e ar naikit, and thairfor, Alleace! And I have no gud claithes in this place ?ow for to geive; bot for my saullis heill, For love of God sumthing sall I [?ow] deill. Ane old sakcloath [belyve] scho brocht hir thair, And hes it put upon the Lady faire, And with ane corde it fessonit hir about. On humbill wayis scho thankit hir but doubt, Saying, Fair dame, God ?ow forwaird and quyte, And gif to ?ow the kinrike of delyte, For it that ?e have gevine me richt heir, Of meit, and cloathes, and meritabill cheir. This Gudwyfe raise, and said, My dochter fair, Now goe with me. Togidder then thay fair Unto the sea strandis whill thay [be] come; Scho fand hir cummer at hir hous at home, Scho helsit hir, and on this wayis scho said, Commer, I have brocht [heir] to ?ow ane maid That wald have service, and ?e have mikill to do, I dare be bought that vertewouse is scho; Scho is weill taught, and full of gude maneir, Scho gainis weill to be ?our chalmerer. Ha, gude cummer, that is weill said of ?ow! Ane chalmerer! and waits not quhair nor how That scho is cumit, or gif that scho be leill, I have no will with strangeris to dealle. This Lady said, Fair lady, have ?e no dreid, I sall keipe lawtie baith in word and deid. The Gudwyfe, both for rewth and for pitie, And for the prayer of hir commer, sche Hes hir resavit into hir service, And hir assignit to ane [mein] office. The woman passit to hir hous againe. Meliades in service did remaine With hir maistres; the quhilk unto hir said, Now, at this tyme ?e mane be bissie, maid, For unto Estur cuntrie mone we saill; If it lykis ?ow with me for to travell, Go beare ane fardill of ?on wole anone Unto the schipe, quhilk readie is to gone. And quhen the Lady hard of this tiding, Scho was full glad, and said, At ?our lyking, To saill or go ather be land or sea. Speid hand, the gudwyfe said, for cheritie. The wole to beir scho helpit hir maistres, Whill it unto the schipe all caried was. The marineris be then all redie wer Out of the hevin to pas; the day was cleir, The winde was gud, and up the saills thay drew, Full fast thay glyd, out throw the floodis they flew, Whill thay com to the cuntrie of Esture. When thay aryvit into ane port full sure, Swyth landit this Gudwyfe with hir new maid, Whair thay fand cairtis, and theron hes laid Thair merchandeice, and unto Estur toune Thir twa ar past or that thay maid sojorne, Whilk was the fairest toune in that cuntrie, Thair dwellis the Earle and eike the Ladie frie. Meliades full nait and bissie was To beir at the command of hir maistres The woll unto hir cousigne [saif]; and syne Hir maistres gave hir quyet discipleine, Saying, My dochter, be bissie in service, My awnt the better [then] will ?ow chereice, For I perchance will leave ?ow with hir heir, Quhair ?e may vertew and gude maners leir; What is ?our name anone ?e to me schaw? Scho said, My name is Ladar, ?e sall knaw. Ladar, scho said, ?our cloathes doe away, And I sall sumthing better ?ow aray. Scho gave hir sark, kirtill, [and] hose and schoune. The Lady kneillit quhen that this was doune, And thankit hir with sober humbill cheir, And was alse weill content withouttin weir As scho was quhyllume of cloath of gold pretious; Of haill cloathing hir heart was full joyous. This Gudwyfe passit to hir cousingis, And ather uther grate with tendernes. Quhen thay had spokin togidder at laser, They gart belyve make redie the supper, And to it went with mirrie cheir and glaid. This Ladie stude, and to thame service maid, And that scho did so weill and perfytlie, With fair effeir and countinance gudlie, That mervellit was the Maistres of this hous, Quhilk in her heart was mirrie and joyous, And speirit at hir awnt quhat [maid] scho was: And scho hir told the maneir mair and les, And how scho was so trew and diligent In hir service, and humbill of intent; And counsallit hir to taike hir in service, For scho was vertewus ay at all devyse. Scho hir resavit with ane glaidsum cheir, And syne did efter ryse from the suppeir. Hir cummer departit, and hir leave taine hes, And went to bed; and Ladar bissie was, And then to bed scho went hirself to rest, As scho that was with labour sore oprest; Bot mikill of the nicht scho did bewaill, That fortoun did so scharplie hir assaill; ?it ay scho thankit God and gave him gloire, Of all hir trubillis and hir chansis soire: Bot never scho micht forget Clariodus, Of quhais love scho brint so mervellus, And langit so, that winder was to tell Hir sad thochtis, hir tormentis all haill. Unto hirselfe with mone full pitious, Alleace, scho said, wist ?e, Clariodus, What travell I have endureit for ?our saike, Full wofull wald ?e be, I undertake; And how that I arayit am and clede, And how so purelie that I ly in bed, ?e wald not at the leist all be content: Bot all is welcum to me that God hes sent, Whom I beseik of his magnificence, Clariodus, to send ?ow patience, That for my saike ?e do not sic vengence, That efter may turne to ?our displisance. When scho was so weirrie, formurnit, and forweipit, With trubillit spreit and frayitlie, scho sleipit; And gat up airlie be the nicht was gone, And maid the fyre, syne set the pote thairon; The house scho swoupit and did all that effeirit. Hir Maistres raise richt as the day upcleirit, And to the marcat [early] wald scho went With Ladar as ane servant diligent. Then [up] scho tuike ane fardell on hir heid, And with hir went withoutin ony pleid. The woll thay sauld for pryce that mycht suffice, And hame for it tuike uther merchandyce; Syne to the denner went and maid gud cheir. The Gudwyfe raise up efter the denneir, And at hir aunt scho tuik hir leave to wend Hame to hir cuntrie, doing hir commend To freindis all, and to this Ladar eike; And scho, with countinance bening and meike, Hir thankit of hir gentrice, inclynand, And wald hir have convoyit to sea strand: Bot scho wald not, bot gart hir hame returne; The uther into Ingland, but sojorne, Is went to schipe, and soune arivit thair; Full oft this Ladar bad hir weill to faire. Thus scho remainit with hir new maistres, And did hir serve with so grit bissines That scho hir lovit as hir dochter deire. Upon ane day, scho said on this maneir Unto hir maistres, Had I silk and gold, I sould make workis fair for to behold; Pursis, beltis, with collourit quaife and kell, Whilkis wald full weill into the mercat sell, And quite the cost that I unto ?ow make. ?e sall it have, scho said, I undertake. Scho bought hir pirnis baith of gold and silke. And scho hes maid hir fair workis of that ilke. Hir maistres hes them presentit in the faire, And mikill mony scho tuike for thame thair. So at the last amongs hir workis all, Full curious workis scho maid, and most royall War ower the lave in curiositie, The quhilk hir maistres grit ferlie had to see; Whairfoir scho gart hir fold them in ane cloath, And follow hir, thocht scho sumthing was loath, Unto the Earleis palice of Estur. This Ladar, that was ane ladie of nurtur, Obeyit hir maistres, and on with hir is went. Unto the Countes both thay war present, Whilk callit on this Ladar for to se Hir marchandice; and with benignitie Scho com and kneillit to this Ladie doun, And schew hir workis craftie of faschoun. The Countes them commendit grittumlie, And said, they war the fairrest works alluterlie, That scho had seine into hir lyves space: So com the Earle in at the dore in cace, Thay raise to him and maid him reverence. Meliades of angellyk clemence Be then recoverit had hir bewtie, And was againe alse lustie for to se As of before, and haillit haill and sound, Whair breer and thorne had maid hir mony wound; Thairfoir grit mervell was amongs them all Of hir bewtie that stude imperiall Abouth all uther ladies that was thair, Over uther flouris as dois the lilie faire. For as ane thing celestiall to se The Earle did behold hir plesand bewtie, He thocht scho semit, and eike he thocht hir lyke To the Princes of all Brittane kinrike, The Kingis dochter, Meliades the bricht, Baith of hir visage and of hir havingis richt; Bot weill he trouit that Meliades Sould never beine arayit on sike wyse. Hir steidfastlie luik to [full] oft he wald. [And when scho saw that he did hir behald,] Abaisit scho was, and sumthing hir declynit Hir bricht visage that so of bewtie schynit, As scho that never furthie was nor peart, Nather in presence nor ?it into desert; Bot as ane innocent ever under dreid, Full of assurit [modest] womanheid; Far from Dormigill in crueltie, Or Panthassilla in magnanimitie, Bot neirer Grisshald with hir tender breist Of soverane vertew, quhilk is God aneist. When that thay had thair marchandice all fynit, And mirrilie collationat and dynit, The nobill Countes tuike at thaim hir leave, Gart twentie goldin bassants to tham give. Grit talking was amongs them all that nicht, Of Ladar and of hir brave bewtie bricht. When thay come hame hir maistres said hir to, We are rewairdit michtilie, quoth scho, All for ?our verie craft; Have silver heir, Be ?e butlar and make us mirrie cheir. This Ladar hes resavit the mony, And maid hir maistres weill to fair perdie, Of mychtie wyns and plesant meitis deir; Syne servit hir with womanlie effeir. Scho bought hir stufe of gold and silkis than, And with hir warkis mikill thing scho wan. Now of this Ladar leave I will ane throw, And of Clariodus sumthing to ?ow schow. Clariodus in armes day by day, So mikell he wrocht at everie hard assay, That wonder was to tell or ?it to heir, The knightlie deidis of him that hes no peir; His nobill bodie was never out of stoure, His bloodie sword restit never ane houre Fra day being whill that the nicht apeir, He so rememberis on his Ladie cleir, To bring the Turkis to distructioun, That he may hame more glaidlie mak him boun. Thair fell on him so hard rememberance Of his Ladie, with sic continuance, That nather micht he sleip nor ?it take rest, Langourus absence so sairlie him opprest; Ather he thocht the weiris to make schort, Or ellis to die among the Heathin sorte. He had ane quarter of the toune to gyde, And ane port readie for to cast up wyde, When that him list, to ische upon his fone. On of his constabillis gart he call anone, And bad make redie be the day was licht His companie, and in thair geir themdicht, That be the morrow all his lustie sorte Sould redie be abyding at the port. Thay soupit with the Constabill that nicht, Disporting thame with heartis glaid and licht; Syne tuike thair leave, and to thair bed ar gone. He on the morne could glaidlie him dispone Out at the porte to isch with all his mein?e, And at all peices enarmit weill was he, And ischit furth with all his companie Upon the awfull Turkis quhair thay ly. The trumpit blew ane weirlyk sound on heicht; He gave his coursour with his spurris bricht, And schot upon the Heathin with ane schout, And with his speir he enterit in the route Amongis his foes; bot or his big lance brake Full monie ane Sarasine lay deid on his bake. He pullit out his sword delyverlie, And dang the Heathin doun dispitfullie; He maid alse monie peices of thair theis, As dois the wricht small spaillis of the treis, All rougently he ruschit throw [the] rout Of woundit men; befoir him gois the schout. The Caine himself hes hard the suddan cry Among his folk rising so hidiously, On hors he lape and forward com in haist; The michtie Sowdane him followed fast. Clariodus was war, and weill he knew That the grit Caine com him to persew; He ruschit upon him with ane felloun feir, And with his sword him to the sadill scheire; His corps devidit into pairtis two; And syne unto the King he did rycht so. The Heathin wounderit upon that felloun deid, And him the way thay roumit than gud speid. The Cristein men seing his deidis mervellous, Thay cryit, Vive, Vive, Clariodus! Long lyfe, renoune, heich glorie and honoure Be unto thÃ© that is of warldis flour. He namit Jesus, that blissit Saviour cleir, And forwart preissit with ane knichtlie feir; His folks did manfullie thair foes assaill, Thair swordis went alse thik as schour of haill. When the Constabill hard tyding of this thing, To feild he cam withoutin tarying, With knichtis that war valiand in feild, On hors enarmit cleir under scheild; At quhais cuming monie ane Turke can die. The King of Cyprus, on the turret hÃ©, Beheld the battell furious and woode, The crewell scheding of the Heathine bloode Be Cristine knichtis bauld and chevalrus, And speciallie be gud Clariodus, Wha restit never, bot ever dang all doune, He was in fight furious as ane lyoun. The King did him commend, and ferliet of his deidis, He gart his men assend upon thair steidis, And isch out of the toun to thair support; Full manie thowsand thrang out at the port, As swift lyouns desyrous of thair pray; The Cristine men preisit to the hard assay. Fast heir and thair the Heathine ar dung doun With mortall straikis of occisioun; Bot maist of all the gud Clariodus, Alse fearce in fight as lyoun furious, His brand ay bathand in the Heathine bloode, So fairis he as ane tyger woode; Before his forcie arme of great renoune, Unto the ground both hors and man gois doun; His countinance baith wyld and terribill, His michtie corpis baith wicht and invincibill, Strong as ane toure againis the speiris poynt, Micht naine againe abake him put a joynt. When he thus throw the feild so forcilie With sword in hand did ryd, richt ernustlie The Heathine sort for him war so adreid, That richt as scheip befor him [fast] they fled. Of cruell slaughter seisis never the stryfe, Whill not ane Heathin man was left on lyfe, For thay war vinquist all and dungin doune, And finallie put to confusioun; And of the Cristine diet few or none, So gratiouslie did God for thame dispone. Efter the feildis great discomfitour, Clariodus, that mikill was of valoure, Is to the michtie Caineis pail?eoun went, Whair infinit of thesaure importent Was keipit in full great quantitie, The number of it could no man estimie; Thair was of gold, and pretious stainis deir, And rich juellis to by ane reallem weill neir, Quhilk he gart be tursit to the sea Unto his schip; and suith it is that he Amongis men gave mekill of this riches, For he all tyme was full of nobilnes. Among all uther thesaure fand he thair Ane tabiller of chase richt wounder fair, Of gold all wrocht with pretiouse stonis bricht, Diamants, sapheiris and roobies casting licht; Whilk stonis war so grit and ferlie deir, As radious lampe schyning also cleir, The knightis did it pryse that war thair To be worth ane kingis ransoune and maire. He gart ane squyer tak it and with him go Unto the Constabillis tent withoutin ho, Disarmit of his helme; and quhen that he Come in the tent he said, Sir, God ?ow se. The Constabill answeirit and said, Ha, gentill Knight, In ?our arming thair is no fault of sight; How ar ?e now unarmit now sa soune, I traist, quoth he, the danger is all donne. Then lewgh thay both with joy and mirrines. Clariodus said, Will ?e play at the ches. ?ea, said the Lord, have ?e ane tabilleir? That sall ?e se, I have it with me heir. He schew it furth in presence of thame all. And quhen the Constabill saw the ches royall, Whair of the men war all of massie gold And stonis bricht, gudlie to behold; So faire of forme, and great of quantitie, He said it was ane royall sight to se, And said, he never saw so rich ane thing, The maike of it possest no Cristien king. Clariodus said, Of ?our nobilitie, Sir, will ?e doe ane plesance unto me, As for to give this tabiller of ches Unto the Queine of France hir nobilnes, Me humblie commending unto the King, And to the Queine maist lustie and bening, As I that am thair servitor at all Whill that I leive; bot ?e forgive me sall, That I ?ow charge sik message for to doe, The quhilk perteinis not ?our honour to, I meane sik travell to undertaike for me, War it not to the Queinis Majestie; I sould this have presentit myself trewlie, War not that I in Ingland suddantlie Man pas, quhairfor as now ?e me excuse. The Constabill said, I will no way refuse, So mikill service do to ?ow as this; And quhen ?e list to France to cum, I wise ?e salbe welcum, dreidles, to the King, For he hes hard of ?ow gud comoning; Diverse reports hes cumin to his eare Of ?our great heighnes both in peace and weir; And so hes [he] resavit the tabilleir. Togidder as they spake on this maneir, The Sarasinis tents spuil?eit thair mein?e, Whair thay fand thesawre [in] great quantitie, Whilk maid thame rich for terme of all thair lyfe. Thir Lordis hes them readie maid belyve. The French Constabill and Sir Clariodus Upon thair hors assendit full joyous; Unto the King of Cyprus thay raid ifeir, The quhilk did meit them in his best maneir Without the ports, with royall companie, The joyous trumpits sounding mirrilie. The King hes donne the Constabill imbrace, And him resavit with ane mirrie face, Oft thanking him of his nobill support. To quhom the Constabill thir wordis did report, The laud heirof perteinis not to me, Bot only to this Knicht that ?e heir se, Clariodus, the rose and flour of armis, From his sword edge micht helpe no harnis; He was the haill caus of the discomfitoure, Nixt God our forcie campioun in the stoure, Give him the laud, give him the thanks always, Of victorie and Turkis haill suppryse; His nobill deidis giving great commend, Saying, But dreid, unto the warldis end, Thair is no Knicht onlie with his hand That hes donne half the deidis valiand In all his tyme that ?e have donne this day, Thairfor ane honour ?e have conquist for ay; I wonder nocht thocht ?e be val?eand, For ?e ar cum, as I [do] understand, On baith the sydis of rycht nobill bluid, And thairfor, Sir, on neid ?e mon be gud. Clariodus said, Sir, withouttin dreid, ?e gif to me more name than thair is deid; Bot onlie half alse far as ?e report, Richt weill beset I wald think [me] at schorte. The King put him betwixt thir Knichtis two, And altogidder to Bruland can thay go, And enterit in the Kingis palice fair, Full great triumph and feasting [alse] was thar. The Queine and eike hir dochter com to hall, With monie lustie ladie gent and small. It war ane want thair coursis for to tell. Clariodus, that is of knightheid well, Was cherisit so and feastit on sik wyse, Long war to schaw the maner and the gyse. When thay had dynit, thay all to chalmer wente. The King, the Queine, with lustie ladies jent, Thair all the day did dance and make gud sport, The seasoun war ower prolix to report. When even aproachit, to supper then they go, Thair royall fair as now I will pas fro. Efter the supper, on the samine wyse, I can ?ow nocht the maner all devise As thay disport, carrell, dance and sing, Lordis, ladies, and lustie knichtis ?ing. Clariodus requyerit was to dance; He him excusit with fair countinance, Bot all for nocht, excuse availl micht none; With uther lordis he to the dance is gone, So verie weill and manerlie withall, Prysit he was with ladies grit and small, And with the companie everilk wicht. Thay thus disport quhile mides of the nicht; Syne everilk lord and ladie leave hes taine Full courteslie, and to thair Innis are gaine. The King had sonnes that war richt fair and ?ing, That loved Clariodus abone all uther thing; With him they ar to Innis gane infeir, And all to make him companie and cheir; The Constabill eik him cherest tenderlie, As he that was baith vail?eand and worthie. Thus, day by day, thair is no more to tell, In nobill joy and mirrines thay dwell Whill that awcht dayis war all gone outrycht; Syne tuike thair leave to pas everilk wicht, First at the King, syne at his Lordis eike, Syne at the Queine and at his Ladies meike. At thair departing wofull was the King, For he thocht that his lustie dochter ?ing Sould have beine waddit with Clariodus, Thocht fortoun wald not tholl it to be thus. The King maid to the constabill instance For to commend him to the King of France, And thanke him of his help and gude supplie; Syne thesawre gart in full grit quantitie Deliver unto him before he went, Imbracing [him] rycht hartlie in intent. Ather from uther tuike thair leave anone. Syne the King tuike Clariodus allone, And said, Fair Sir, commend me to the King, And thanke him of his nobill supporting Againis my foes strong in battell; And eik I thank ?ow of ?our grit travell That ?e have maid, cuming in this cuntrie; Syne of ?our nobill helpe and gud supplie, Bot quhais vail?eand deidis and chevalrie We hade not lichtlie gottin victorie. Grite giftis profferit to him the King, Bot he thairof as thane wald [tak] no thing. And quhen the King hes seine [that] it is so, He gart ane squyer for ane palfray go, Quhilk as the snow in collour was all quhyt, And of fassioun wounder donne perfyte, Both meane and taill did of [the] bricht gold schyne, In warld men deimit thair was none so fyne. Then said he to Clariodus, Sen ?e Naine uther giftis will resave of me, This horse I give ?ow of a gentill kynd, That ?e may [ever] have me in ?our mynd. Full courteslie then thankit he the King, And said, Sir, I am ?ouris in all thing Whill that I leive, so wyselie God me speid, As I that trew salbe in word and deid To ?ow and ?ouris for now and ever more; ?our Henes keip the michtie King of glore. So thay depairtit with tender imbracing, For verie pitie weipit than the King, And rycht so [sorelie] did Clariodus, For to depart thay war so dolorus. At all the Court thair leave hais taine thir two, With thair mein?e and to thair hors they go; And then ascendit all with ane purpose, Thay raid unto the port of Carrados, Whair that thay fand [thair] schippis all redie, The marineris thay wrocht full bissilie. The Constabill now at Clariodus Hes taine his leave with wordis gratious, To cum in France requyring him sa fast, So that this Lord hes grantit at the last, His aquentance to make with the [gude] King, To him anone promisit he this thing. When the Constabill his leave hes taine thus, He bad adew to Sir Clariodus, And enterit into his barke, and that anone, And all his folkis ar to thair schipis gone. The air was cleir, the wind was verie gud, They drew up saillis, and sped them ouer the flude. Clariodus gart furth ane barke hir drese All full of nobill tresour and riches That he had won into the Caines tent; Unto his Father in Estur he it sent, And bad commend him to his Father thair, Schawing to them at lenth of his weilfair; Syne enterit into his schip richt haistilie, And to thair schipis went all his companie; Thay drew up saillis sweith, and furth thay glyd Atowre the floodis that ar baith roume and wyd. Now ceise I of Clariodus ane throw, And of the Constabill sumthing will schew. The Constabill of France aryvit sweith Unto the port of Rowan, glaid and blyth, And went to Parice with all his folks in feir, And to the King is gone with mirrie cheir. The King richt glaid was of his hame cuming, And maid to him richt heartlie welcuming, And speirit of his tydingis and his fair. Be richt report he told him les and maire Of all the weiris schortlie for to saine, And how the Caine of Tartarie was slaine, And of his host the haill distructioun; And of the valiantnes and grite renoune Of the maist worthie and wicht Clariodus, And of his deidis worthie and chevellrus, And how his only manheid and his micht Monie ane tyme pat the Turkis to flicht, And how he slew the Caine and put him doun, And pat his folkis to thair distructioun, Whairthrow the mortall weiris tuike ane end, And how he bad him to his Grace commend; And how the King of Cyprus worthines Bad him commend him to his Nobilnes, Him thankit of his folkis and supplie, And how that he promisit for to be His in all thing, and stand in his quarrell, Richt as he did to him in strong batell. Blyth was the King quhen he hard this tyding; Bot of this Knicht he ferliet ouer all thing, Throw quhais deidis the Turkis war distroyit, Of him to hear his heart was so joyit, That he never irkit of him to speir, His face, his fassoun, his statur and maneir. He tuike him in ane chalmer him allone, And speirit at him uther tydings anone. And he tauld furth as he requyrit ay; ?it, Sir, he said, I have sum thing to say, This nobill Knicht of quhilk I [do] ?ow tell, The verie flour of chevelrie and well, Hes sent ane gudlie present to the Queine, I wald anone that it war with hir seine. First I will se it, said the King; and thane To fech this tabeller he sent ane man. Sone it was brocht, presentit to the King, Quha it beheld, considering in all thing Of it the valour and the [wondrous] micht; He said, Forsuith it is the fairest sight, And the maist pretious of the quantitie, That in my lyfe I ever saw with ey. He sent anone to chalmer for the Queine, Wha com with all hir ladies fair and scheine, Whom the Constabill salust hes, and syne Hes tauld hir all the cace or he wald fyne; Scho luikit on the royall ches of gold, That pretious was and lustie to behold, And it commendit wonder grittumlie, And so did all the ladyes that stude by. Then said the Queine, I thanke the gentill Knicht, That hes me send this thesaure of sic micht, Forsuith he was no wratch I dar [it] tell, That hes pairtit with so rich ane jewell. And syne considering, said the nobill King, That he [?ow] never saw in his leving, And ?it to me his name [it] is unknawin. The Constabill said, With honour it salbe schawin, He is to name callit Clariodus, Knicht of this warld maist worthie and famous, Sone to the nobill Earle of Esturland. Then said the King, He man be vail?eand, For he is cumit of nobill parentell, His Father the Count know I verie well; I have him seine into this Court repaire, Under the sone I know non gudlier In all maner and wyser nor is he, The better alwayis his Sone neidis most be; And eik of Sir Clariodus himsell Out of Ingland full oft have I hard tell, And of his manlie bewtie and vertew, Now find I weill that thay said of him trew, Whairfor, certes, attoure all [uther] thing, I long to have him in my Court dwelling. The Constabill said, He hes promisit me, Within schort tyme in this land for to be. That wald I, quoth the King, sa God me save, Then his aquentance dreidles I sall have. When they had long tyme commonit in that place, The Queine gart put the chaker in that cace, And gart ane ladie take it up anone, And syne unto hir chalmer is scho gone. Thame now in France in joy we let remaine, And speike we of Clariodus againe. Clariodus did all his bissines To gar the mariners them speid and dres To land alsweith with all thair saillis bent, Of his Ladie sic thochts can him torment; The more that he aproachit to the land, In heat desyre he was ay [more] birnand His Ladie for to se: and then belyve On Ingland coast he did saiflie aryve, Neir by the toun that reallie is wallit, Belvilladoun quhilk to name was callit; Thair landit he and all his chevalrie, And to the toun thay raid richt royallie. Clariodus, as he raid throw the streit, None of his auld aquantance could he meit; In all the toun no kynd of man he saw That he was aquantit with or did knaw; He saw so monie faces that war strange, He dread full sair that thair had beine sum change Into the Court; quhairfor he mervell hade; Thay fled him ay and war for him adred, For thay war of Sir Thomas inputing, The toun to rewle and put in governing. At his Innis this Lord [then] lichtit doun, And hes gart herberie his folkis in the toun, All bot his fellowis quhilkis ever abaid With him still quhidder he ?eid or raid. His host him helsit sum deill hevilie. Perseving hes Clariodus thairby, Tuik in his mynd ane suddant trew consait That sum tratour had wrocht a sore debait Againis him, bot most was in his thocht Meliades, if hir had aillit ocht. Full suddantlie to changing can his hew, The bluide alsweith intill his face it schew; Of misbeleife the stound struike to his heart, That in his breist it trublit him sore inuart; Unto his chalmer sadlie he is gone. And to his host then cumin is anone Ane merchand of the toun, speiring thus, If he had spokin with Clariodus. Na, said the host, I dar not with him speike, For wo my heart was abill for to breke When I him saw; bot he hes persaving, Throw my sad cheir he tuik evill conforting. The merchand said, Methinke that gud it war, That to my Lord we passit both in feir. The host consentit, that Bartane heicht to name. This Allane was ane man mikill of fame, And monie ane day was mair of the toun; Bot from his heicht Sir Thomas pat him doun. When unto chalmer cuming war thir two, This Allane was in heart full hevie and wo, Who helsit him with teiris distelling. Clariodus persavit this in all thing, Allane, ?e ar full welcum unto me; What new tydingis, my frind, [fra Court] bring ?e? Now tell how fairis the Kingis nobilnes, The Queine and hir ?oung dochter the Princes? I cam not in Court, said Allane, thir monie day, Whairfor the maner I can not tell perfay; All that ?our Father pat in the Kingis cervice, Sir Thomas hes put out on felloun wayis, And me he hes exonerit among the leave Of the office that I had wount to have; The King he rewellis and gydis as he list, Whairthrow the realme is hereit and oprest; No man may cum into the Kings presence, Bot throw his gyding and his gud plesance; And ane thing, Sir, and worst of all the leave That he hes donne, thairfor the Feind him have, Be false report and divillisch treasoun eike He hes gart take Meliades the meike, The Kingis dochter and his heare also, Withoutin caus and cruellie hir slo, And, fy! alleace! murderit hir foullie, Into ane nicht without onie mercie, With cruell churllis murdreist cruellie, The trewth I may not tell [?ow] for pitie. When that Clariodus hard this tyding, The crampe of death did [fast] to his heart thring; He gave ane sigh, and said, but wordis mo, Ha, Ladie myne, and ar ?e endit so! The sword of sorrow gave him sic a wound Unto the heart with sik ane deidlie stound he micht not suffer it, bot doune he fell So pitiouslie that sorrow war to tell; Unto the pavement as deid duschit he, His pail visage was gaistlie for to se. Pallexis up start soune, [and] cryit Ha! For ower grit wo he wist not quhat to sa. The Knichtis foure and burgis twa [than] ran, And liftit up the paill and deidlie man, And on ane bed him laid or thay wald ho, And with thair handis schuike him to and fro, And soune his teith oppinit with ane knyfe; Bot still he lay [thair] deid as out of lyfe, And nothing lyke from daith [for] to revert; Whairof his fellowis sic sorrow tuik in heart, Thay maid sik duill that never hard was maire, Never sicht thay saw grevit them [sa] sair. Sik sorrow maid Pallexis and his brother, That naine of them micht counsall gif to other. In this estait lang lay this jentill Knicht; Bot the grit King of glorie and of micht, That ever is wicht quhaever be waike or seik, He wald not suffer of his mercie meike Him that was gentill ay and merciabill In sik ane wyse to end so miserabill. So at the last he out of sound abraid Alse wode of cheir, and luikit rycht affrayd; He saw ane window and wald have lappin out; His fellowis them assemblit him about, Withholding him among them tenderlie, Him comforting with wordis most heartlie. He paisit then the chalmer up and doun, Melancolike, alse furious as ane lyoun; His eine thay brint and flamit as ane gleid, Desyring to revenge the traitorheid Of the maist saikles murder and felloune, Done to this innocent Ladie be tresoun. Alleace! he said, quhat sall I do or say, My warldis joy is [from me] reft for ay; O now quhair sall I go or quhair sall I ryd, Quhair sall I walke at evin or morrow tyd! Whairto for sleip sould I to bedis go, Or quhairto ryse, I waits of nocht bot wo, Or quhairto leive I, [now] thus myne allone, When all my cumpanie is fra me gone; O Death, cum slay me cative in distres, That never sall have ane day of mirrines! Why lests my bodie, seing my heart is slaine, Fairweill for ever all eardlie joy againe! And this he said with sik ane pitious cheir, It was ane paine him for to se or heir; And sorrow him tormentit so fellounlie, Monie ane tyme he cryit God mercie, Have mercie, Lord, that [wiselie] hes me wrocht, Syne with thy daith so deir thow hes me bocht, That I fall not in desperatioun; Thy woundis fyve be my salvatioun That I do nocht that may my soul [eer] tyne; I ask thÃ© mercie, sweit Redemer myne, Now of my greif and my impatience, Who am bereft of all intelligence, And can no resoun have nor sufferance Whill daith upon me do his uterance; And eike have mercie on ?on fair Ladie, Sen I hir lovit for no villanie, As for the cryme scho stervit ane innocent, And pitiouslie with churlis all to rent, And murtherit as ane theif without a judge, Be thow hir ressait, succur and refuge; And let thy woundis be for hir remeid, That for hir sinnis oppinit war so reid; Among thy angellis resave hir in thy joy, As thow that ar of mercie Prince and Roy. With that the teiris ?eid out of his eine, With sichis deip, and sobbis ay betweine, That none on lyfe micht se him nor behold, Bot he anone sould weipe thoch he not wold, Suppose his heart war harder nor the stone. His fellowis foure maid ane pitiouse mone For him in secreit [wyse]; bot not the les, With suggerit wordis of great humbilnes, Thay comfortit him, and oft bad him eit: Bot he so fillit was with dolour grite, No meit he wald isay; bot bad that thay Sould to thair supper go without delay. When they had soupit all, thame gart he call, And said, Go send furth to our frindis all In this kinrick, both Prince, Earle, Lord and Knicht That lovis me, or in my quarrell richt Will make defence, and pray thame tenderlie, Into all hast that thay will make redie To cum with all their nobill chevalrie In my supplie; for now [that] verilie, I never thinke flesch to eit nor wyne to drinke, Whill that I make ?on Tratour to forthinke That ever he tresoun wrocht on sike wayis, And quhill the daith of fair Meliades Revengit be, that all the warld sall heir. Then Allan said to him on this maneir, My Lord, ?our charge I sall fulfill alway; Bot if ?e wairne those Prinsis, as ?e say, Sir Thomas will get wit, and will evaid: Bot will ?e [now] my counsall doe, he said, ?e sall cum to him [richt] without wairning, In that same place quhair he is with the King. In the toun of Clarans quhairin he remains, Ouklie we carie hay in carts and wains, And I my self sall hay have to the toun; Whairfor I wald [that] threttie men war boun, In cairtis closit [all] weill privilie, All ower with hay coverit quyetlie, And [so] no man will stope [thame] quhill that thay Be went within the gettis, quhair ?e may Ane buschment have a litill ?ow besyde, That haistilie may efter them in ryd. When he hes hard him on this wayis conclude, He thankit him, and said the way was gud; And bad all sould be donne as he [had] said Againe the morne, and all thus reddie maid. He callit on his luiftennantis than, And bad thay sould be redie everie man Neir by the toun of Clarans by the day In the wode syd, and hold them quyetlie Whill that thay hard thame cry within the carts, And then to speid them [out] with mirrie hearts. When this was said, they went all to [their] bed, Clariodus him leinit doune all cled, All nicht bewailling hir death pitiouslie, That was so fair, so gud and womanlie: Bot up he raise full long before the day With his foure fellowis, doing thame aray In weirlyk weidis; and syne went haistilie To Allanis Innis, quhair all war maid redie. Clariodus and his fellowis anone, But longer tarie ar to ane cart all gone, With utheris whom thay lykit best to have, Ane cartar come and furth [the gait] thame drave; The uther cairt [then] fillit was also With men of armis, and thus furth thay go To the toun of Clarains be the licht of day, Whair the draw brig soune drawin have thay; The port was oppin, they enterit suddently, With ane grit noyis raisit up the cry; With that the buschment brake with [richt] gud speid; Clariodus assendit on his steid, And to the palice raid or he wald ho; Pairt of his folkis commandit he to go The toun to search, and ay quhair thay finde Sir Thomas' men, in prissoun them to binde. Clariodus then [maist] unfrayitlie In palice enterit with all his chevalrie, And in that chalmer quhair that was the King, With him Sir Thomas, not witting of this thing; For had he wittin that Sir Clariodus Had landit beine and com so neir as thus, He wald have fled away if that he micht. Amongs them enterit hes this nobill Knicht And lawlie on his knie salust the King With honour dew, and with gud blissing; Syne went and hynt Sir Thomas be the hand, Saying, O trator false and dissaveand, Thankis to God that now is cumit the day That with thy trasoun thow no [way] chape may, That thow hes said, ather sall thow preive, Or it sall turne thÃ© to thy grit mischeive. Syne to his fellowis four gave him in cure, Commanding them that thay sould keip him sure. Syne to the King he said on this maneir, Sir, for this caus I [now] am cumit heir, This cursit tratour with his fellounie, Of verie malice movet and invie, Hes wrocht of his awin imaginatioun, Be false and feindlie conspiratioun, [Sic] wayis ?ow and ?our bloode to distroy, That he micht of this regioun ring as Roy; ?our Dochter innocent he hes put to deid Full saikleslie but mercie or remeid; Wha falslie leit on me, as prove I sall On onie He this day that is mortall That will or dar abyde at his opinioun; Thair is not thrie into this regioun That will mantine his quarrell or defend Bot I sall give him battell to the end Againis them all at onis myne allone, Or with them syndrie feight [sall] on be on; Whairfor gar call him heir befor ?ow now, And speir if he the treasoun will avow. The King him callit; and then Clariodus, In presence of them all, said to him thus, Sir Thomas, take ?ow choise of thingis two, Ather ?ourself in battell with me to go And twa with ?ow the best [that] ?e can waill, [And curst be he that in the fight shall faill,] Or prove that ?e have said befor the King, Than, if ?e doe, I merite punisching. Then this Tratur trimblit [baith] fute and hand, And said, I will not into batell stand, I me confes of all this false treasoune, I have deservit daith at schort sermoun; My Lady I gart saikleslie be schent, For trewth to daith scho is gone innocent; Thir letteris with my handis all I wraite. Then all the Court at onis maid regrate For the ?oung Princes, fair Meliades, All causles put to daith on this wayis; Thay gart the letteris thair all [be] present, Caussing Sir Thomas wryte incontinent, To se if that the writtis lyke war: thane This ilk Sir Thomas [for] to wryte begane; Quhilk wryting so lyke was to the uther, That nane of theme micht be knowen quhidder: Then with ane voice thay cryit all at onis, Ha, birne the cruell Tratur, fell and bonis! Clariodus upon his kne sat doune, And askit justice of the deid felloun. The King maid mone, that sorrow was to sie, For hir that was so full of grite bewtie, So full of vertew and of gentilnes, He wold have slaine himself in his madnes War nocht the Lordis was him besyde; He raif his hair and pitiouslie he cryed. To wryte ?ow all his sorrow and his cair, It sould me occupy ane long day and mair; He fell on kneis before Clariodus, Saying to him thir wordis pitious, Let not ?on Tratur first to his deid go, Bot begine at me and with ?our sword me slo, That most have deservit for to die; All princes may exampill take of me, Thus unadvysit to distroy thair blood, Or than advysit, counsall thairto conclude; Why let ?e me in wo thus liveing heir, On me doe furth ?our deid, schrinke for no feir. With that he raif his awin hair pitiouslie, And strake him self wounder fellounlie. Clariodus alsweith tuike up the King Into his armis, thus to him saying, Sir, ?e sould nocht sit on kneis to me, Bot unto God, to him fail?eit [have] ?e And to the leigis of ?our regioun, For ?e distroyit ?our successioun, Thair onelie Princes, and ?our richteous aire, That quhyllum was countit [sa] wyse and fair. The King commandit that his seigis royall Sould be renewit, wher the pepill all Micht se the mortall castigatioun Of this Sir Thomas, for his false treasoun; At his command quhilk soune removit was And in the grit court sat of his palice: And syne commandit he the burgisis two, Clariodus' host and Allan also, To make ane oppin proclamatioun Of all things [to be done] with trumpit sound, That all the peipill micht of Clarains toun Cum and se justice donne of his treasoun; And bad them bring the burriours also. Thir two, as than commandit, furth thay go, As he bad doe, anone the samine ways, And maid ane scaffald upon heicht to ryse. Sir Thomas callit was in judgement, And with ane sise fyllit incontinent; Syne damnit to be drawin ilke lith from uther, In presence of King Philipon his brother; Of quhilk was maid ane executioun Upon the scaffold, the peipill environ: The peipill micht not lichtlie numberit be, Whilk thrang so thike the maner for to sie. The King in judgment sat [exaltit] thair Whill justifit Sir Thomas' folkis war And all that gave him counsall or supplie To doe that felloun deid of crueltie. [This done,] unto Belvelladoun thay raid, Into the Court grit hevines was maid. Clariodus raid speiking with the Queine, Betwix quhom [ay] grit sorrow micht be seine; When they spake of Meliades the bricht With weiping all to blindit was thair sight. The King alsweith is enterit in the toun, Whair he reposit, and quhyllum maid sojorne For to take ordour with everilk officer That Sir Thomas had put from office thair. Then all was wrocht and endit on this wyse, And enterit all agane to thair service. Clariodus his leive tuike at the King, As he had long thocht of his tarying; The cuntrie that sum tyme [syne] he thocht fair, And had in it sic plesour to repair, Than thocht he all was bair and barren wildernes, So far his heart was bund in hevines That in that land he micht not eit nor sleip, Bot weipand ay with sadest sichis deip. The King said, Sir Clariodus, I se That ?e na longer list to byd with me; ?it pitie this realme, gentill Knicht, That in sike perrell standis day and nicht, For fault of ane the peipill to convoy; And ?e depairt, fairweill fra me all joy; ?our Father eik, efter ?our [hame] cuming, I wait will enter no more in this rigne, Then it is put cleine to distructioun: Thairfor I make ?ow supplicatioun, That ?e disdaine not for to byde with me, Whill that ?our Father cum into this cuntrie. Clariodus wald not him grant, for quhy, He trouit never to cum againe suithly, And for to heicht ane thing and keip it nocht Was never in his mynd, deid nor thocht; Whairfor he wald not grant for to abyde. The peipill cryit all on everie syd, Ha, gentill Knicht, and flour of nobilnes, Leave never the King into his heich distres; Bot rew on him, for his saike hes ?ow bocht, For he to leive langer sall he nocht, For sorrow and langour efter ?e be gone. When that this Knicht hard thair pitious mone, Confort ?ow, Sir, he said, for Godis saike, And I sall doe so, heir I undertake, That pleasit ?e salbe, [as] I weill wait; Now heir my brother that Palexis heicht, And eik my cousing Amandur his brother, I sall them two leave with ?ow and no uther, Albeit I war full laith them to forgo; Bot ?it with ?ow thay sall byd baith the two, As thay that manheid and discretioun Hes for to rewle the cuntrie up and doun. This being finit, schortlie for to tell, Clariodus, that is of knichtheid well, His leave hes takine baith at King and Queine, With wofull teares birsting out of his eine; He tuike his leave at the merchand also, And at his gud host, thanking oft thay two Of thair gud service and thair bissines; And syne at all his freindis more and les: Bot quhen anone the peipill saw him ryde Out throw the toun, full pitifullie thay cryed, Fair weill, our confort now and all our joy! Fair weill, our cheif protector out of noy! Fair weill, the gentillest Knicht and maist worthie In all the warld that beine aluterlie! Out of the toun he haistilie did ryd, For clamour of the pepill him besyd; And quhen he was ane myle out of the toun, He and his fellous thair lichtit [tham] doun; To tham he said, My frindis traist and deir, I ?ow reverence, and oft thankis ?ow heir Of ?our service and nobill cumpanie, I me commend to ?ow maist hartfullie, Now mon I pase from ?ow, and nothing wote If I to ?ow will cum againe or not: Bot ?e sall not be dispurvayit at all, My Father in this cuntrie soune cum he sall, And traist richt weill [that] not forget sall I To gar my Father compleit finaly ?our mariagis, be ?e not adred; My frind Palexis, ?e sall Cadar wed, Whom ?e have handfast; and Amandur sall get The King of Spain?es sister Mandonet; And ?e that ar my uther fellowis two Sall have Barronis dochteris also Into our land, quhilk neir ar of our blude; And seing that kyndnes ever amongis us stude, Now let us keip it till our latter day, And se that ?e luife uther rycht weill ay: And ?e, my cusings two, over all thing, Exerce ?our office and please weill ?our King; Amongs the peipill conqueis ?e sik name, That ?our frindis have no reproch nor blame. With this, into his armis he did tham fange, And then begouth sik weiping them amang, That pitie it had beine for to behold. Ane efter uther he in his armes fold, And kissit them, bot micht no wirdis say; Syne lap upon his hors and raid his way. Still thay remainit efter he was gone, Sore weiping and bewailling thame allone; Thay wist he wald go walke in wildernes, And never thairefter ane joyous day posses; Whairfor thair painfull sorrow and thair cheir War all to long for to byd on to heir. Thir four full sadlie to the toun thay went, And he as woode man spurrit ower the bent, As he that wist not quhair to ryd or go, His breist was so oprest with inwart greif and wo. Clariodus raid furth on this maneir, Ane grit forrest quhill he aproachit neir; Then sped he him with all the haist he may, For doubt they sould have stoppit him the way. So in the forrest happinit him to meit Ane Palmer cumand, quhilk did on him greit, And of his almes asked him, and said, That felloun briggandis him dispuil?eit had. Clariodus said, Father, for certaine, The halie gaitis that ?e wount to gang Will not alway let ?ow dispurvayit be; ?e sall have all my cloathes, and gif me ?our clothes againe, and tak myne betwine. Glaid was the Pilgrime this ilk change to seine. Clariodus put on the Palmers weid, And he gave him his cloathes and his steid. The Palmer said, My Lord, I weill persave, That seiknes or melancholie ?e have; Have patience in distres for ony thing, For naturallie the warld is ay changing, And glad joy cumis nixt adversitie Be cours of fortounis mutabilitie. Clariodus than thankis to him maid, Saying, God grant it be as ?e have said. Thus went he furth in palmer weid allone, Out throw the forrest quhill the day was gone; The nicht aproachit and he abydis thair, Baith wind and raine [then] dang on him richt sair, That he in hasart was to lose his lyfe. As day begouth and nicht away did drive, He paicet furth, and fand ane small passage, Quhilk had him throw the wood to ane village; He enterit, asking almous for Godis saike; Sum gave him pairt, and sum did him forsaike, And bad him go and wirke, for he was wicht, And fair of persoune thocht he war ane Knicht; Weill tail?eit of his bodie up and doun, They bade him go [and] thrysche in everie toun. Clariodus then sped him bissilie Whill he come to the sea, and tuik harbrie Into ane hevining place where schipes were, And redie for to saill in cuntries seir. Ane was to go in Estur land; whairfore He haistilie hes passit to the schore, And speirit at the marineris in hy, Gif thay wald tak him in thair cumpanie. Thay said, If that he could make gud service, Thay wald resave him into gudlie wayis. Then hes he said, no worke he wald refuse, That onie uther servitor did use. The Skipper said, Go let him in anone, For he is manfull big of brane and bone; He seames to be na balleist in the how, He sall weill hald ane anker or ane tow, To mak our windis [for] to go on force, And he will draw about lyke ony hors; To dicht our meit, full weill gainis ?on seir, To lift ane mekill caldroun on the fyre. Up gois the saillis, the schip gois to the flude, And cuike thay maid Clariodus the gud; He dicht thair meit, and maid tham gud service In humbill maner, and in gudlie wyse. The wind was fair, the schip was gud be saill, The marineris wicht and bissie in travell; To Estur land aprochit thay belyve, And in ane port saiflie did aryve. The merchands unto land past everie one, Clariodus to land is with thame gone, And at the mariners his leave he tuike, Quhilk wald have feit him to have beine thair cuike. He said, Frindis, I mon to Andromage, Quhilk till compleit it is a fair voyage; Whairfor have me excusit for to gone. Thay bad him cloathes, bot he resavit none. He tuike his leave; and thay bad God him gyde. Unto the toun of Estur neir besyd He dressit him to go with bissines, Whair that his Father and his Mother was. Clariodus furth holdeth but sojorne, Whill he com neir the suburbs of the toune; Beholding [all] the toun and the castell, He laid him doun agroufe besyde ane well, And thair he maid the sairest regrating, That micht be hard of ony creatour leving, Saying, Alleace, O toun! O castell and citie! Baith may ?e ban that ilk nativitie Of that divellisch Sir Thomas the tratour, Throw quhom to ?ow sall cum sic [sad] dollour. O Count of Estur, ?e and ?our Ladie, What wofull painis and melancholie Sall to ?ow cum, quhen that ?e know all cleir [How that for greif your Son is dying heir!] How it is falline, and the cursit chance! Thairwith he tuike sik ane [grit] displisance, He brist all out of teiris pitiouslie, Of his unfortoun pleinand wofullie, And maid the hardest lamentatioun That ever was hard in ony regioun. Bot loe, as fortoun turnis so quyetly, Unto this well thair come [all] suddenly Meliades, hame water for to bring, And saw this wofull man on grouffe lying, Bewailling in distrese so pitiouslie, That to behold this Ladie thocht ferlie; So him to heir with monie sob and grone, It wald have thirllit ony heart of stone; And quhill scho him can [thus] behald and se, Scho for him tuike in heart so great pitie, For verie rewth scho weipit and was wo, Saying, My frind, why do ?e ?our self slo? Or quhat ar ?e, that thus so pitiouslie ?our self demainis thus with melancolie? For Godis saike take ?ow sum patience, And to ?our self do never sike offence. Full faine scho wald have comfortit him sum wayis, For scho was haly, cheritabill and wyse. His heid then hes he raisit upon loft, To se quha gave to him thir wordis soft, That confort him upon so meike maneir; Bot all to blindit was his eine so cleir, That he not redilie micht espie hir face, Saying, I thank ?ow Sister, bot alleace! How that it standis with me if that ?e knew, I traist ?e wald upon my painis rew, Or ony in warld that is now on lyve; Or if thay wist how that with daith I stryve, Or knew the caus quhairfor I thus compleine, For to have mercie rewth wald thame constraine On me that is the sorrowfullest wicht In warld that leives under Phebus bricht. This Ladie said, My freind, trest ?e [me] weill, To ony wicht if that ?e list reveale ?our infortoun, and ?our misaventur, It sould ?ow swage sumthing of ?our dollour. He said, My sweit Sister, [the] suith ?e say, If that remeid micht be in onie way Then gud it war for to reveill my paine; Bot ay, alleace! thir words ar all in vaine, Remeid is none, the ender of my wo Is death, alleace! thairfor fra me ?e go, And me to confort ?ow no mair dispone, And let me sterve for uther bute is none. With that he gave ane sigh full cairfullie, And teiris did out rine so wofullie, That wounder was that he sould leive ane hour. Sweit Sir, scho said, the cause of ?our dolour Please ?e reveale; sould it ?ow not displease I sould ?ow schaw how that ane woman was In alse grit trubill and adversitie As ony creatour in earth micht be, And ?it throw grace of God scho did evaid The great missaventur befor hir laide, And houpe hes ?it confortit for to be Alway restorit to hir awin degrie: Thairefter may ?e pryse if ?e or sche, More panis sufferit or adversitie. When that he hard hir [thus] so beninglie Him answeir make, and [eke] so soberlie, To confort him so gritlie desyring, And that scho was so wo for his weiping, Then he begane with ane pitious cheire The cace to tell, saying on this maneir, Nocht long gone syne, I lovit paramour, Ane Ladie quhilk was of all this warld flour, Ane Kingis onlie dochter and his air, Under bricht Phebus was thair naine sa fair, So humbill, gentill, sober and bening, In quhom at schort did everie vertew ring, That was perteining unto womanheid. This eike day star and rose of gudlieheid Was be hir fatheris charge full haistilie Taine to ane wood and murtherit cruellie By the reporting of ane tratour knicht, Alleace, that ever that wofull day was licht! Scho was my eardlie joy and conforting, Whom that I lovit atoure all eardlie thing, My only plesour of all this warld so wyde. He told hir furth, and did no wordis hyde. Scho him beheld with looke full studious; And quhen scho wist it was Clariodus, But mair abaid anone scho to him past, And him beclipit in hir armis fast; For ower grit blisse no wird scho micht outbring, The suddant joy and haistie conforting Unto hir heart it straike so haistilie, Scho micht not suffer it so abundantlie, Bot reveist of hir spreit scho fell in swoun. And than Clariodus of grit renoune, Beholding on hir in [maist] grathlie wayis, And saw it was his fair Meliades, He micht for joy na words bring furth or say, Nor wist weill long quhair he was perfay. And quhen that he of himselfe ocht wist, This Madine into his armis then he thrust, And held hir up quhilk was to him full deir, And tuike cold water of the fontaine cleir And sprinkllit on hir lustie snow quhyt face. So scho recoverit hes within a space, Saying thir wordis, Ha, my Clariodus, I trowit never againe to seine ?ow thus. And with ane sigh, fra that [was] said, anone Ane rusch of blude furth at hir nose is gone, Or ellis I traist scho sould have deid beine, For scho micht not for ower grit joy susteine Withoutin death or passioun corporall: For joy of nature beine celestiall, And with angellis inparticipat; Quhairfor the spirit mon be separat From the bodie, or it grit joy posseid, Or sorrow eik if it gritlie exceid. The blude effusit sa abundantlie, That he could not it stanch nor remidie. Then of the ringe alseweith rememberit he, That was him gevin efter the mellie Be him that was transformit in the lyoun, Whais vertew beine for bludis effusioun; He tuichit hir with it, and scho anone Ceisit of bleiding; and quhan this was gone, Thay uthir in armis did tenderlie imbrace, And oft hes kissit uther in that place. Bot ?it all this micht not him satisfie, He dred that it had beine ane fantasie Fallin on him, throw hevie thochtis sade, Quhairthrow that he had witles beine and mad; Whairfor to hir he said, My Ladie deir, And is it trewth that ?e beine with me heir? Trest weill, quod scho, Clariodus my Knicht, That I am heir full glad to se this sight, Whilk long gone syne to se I trowit never, Sumtyme I weinit we partit beine for ever; And that was quhen the burriouris me led Unto the forrest, and thair me uncled At mid nicht hour, quhen ?e war far me fro. And with that word thay sighit both [the] two. ?our wofull daith, quod he, and gan to weipe, Into my heart enterit is so deipe, That ?it ?our lyfe nocht [all] so perfytlie May in my breist ?it sink so suddantlie. What wald I longer of thair joyis wryte? I can not half report nor put in dyte Thair blisfull cheir and joyous continance, Conforting uther with wordis of plesance. Adoun thay sat and fell in comoning, And them pleasit of monie diverse thing, Doing to uther all the cace reveill, As to thame hapinit, schawing everie deill Thair grit infortoun and adversitie. Ather of uther then had grit pitie. And quhen Meliades on humbill wayis, Had told him all the maner and the gyse, How scho demainit was so pitiouslie, Then he for rewth did weipe full tenderlie. To speik in this, sik plesour tuike thir two, That Ladar had forgettin hame to go; Whairfor hir maistres speirit for hir so fast, Whill scho went furth to seik hir at the last, And fand her sitting onlie with ane man, [Scho thocht hir mad, and thus in wrath began,] Saying, Evill woman, quhy hes thow me betraisit, ?our vertew ay I commendit and praisit, And now I se full weill how that it standis, ?e sall have sair punitioun of my handis: And ?e evill man, quha hes maid ?ow sa pert, To tryst my servand furth in this desert; Wald ?e hir steill fra me in this maneir? Trest weill that sall not ly in ?our power. With awfull luik to Ladar than scho said, ?e sall forthinke that ever this tryst was maid; In ane strange hour was ?our [sad] begining To cum to me, that neid hes of keiping. When Ladar saw hir maistres was [so] movit, Scho was not all content, for scho hir lovit, And eik scho considderit discreitlie, That for hir gud scho spake it veralie; Whairfor scho said, with sweit and humbill cheir, With bening luike and womanlie effeir, My fair Maistres, displease ?ow not I pray, For heir am I that is and salbe ay ?ouris at all, and redie ?ow to pleis: Bot now ?our heart in sumthing to appease, The trewth of this mater ?e sall know of us, Heir is ?our Lordis sone Clariodus But ony dreid, and I am with ?ow heir, The King of Inglandis only dochter deir. This woman was abaisit than sumthing, And speirit how it micht be so falling. And scho hir tauld the cace then oppinlie. Than sat scho doun on kneis sudantlie, Saying, My Lord, I ask ?ow forgivenes, And ?e my Lady full of gentilnes, Forgif me of my fault and negligens, That have sa far misgone in ?our presens, And have me nothing in disdaine nor heat, That now [am] heir ane puire woman, God wait; ?e may me weill distroy at ?our awin will, That hes so far by reasoun said ?ow till. Clariodus [hir] up in armis tuike; Then said Meliades with freindlie luike, Maistres, be glaid, and do [?ow] merrie make, ?e are forgivine, and that I undertake; Have ?e no dreid, bot traist richt verilie We sall ?ow bring to honour suddantlie. Then said scho to Clariodus, My love, Sen God hes set our heartis thus above, That war so deip drounit in hevines, I reid with humbill continence we dres Us to the kirk, and thank God heartfullie; Nane sall ?ow ken in all the toune trewlie, Into this royall habite that ?e weir. With that scho smylit with womanlie effeir; He smylit eike, and said, I me consent. And swa all thrie unto the kirk they went. And leist that folkis sould unto them take heid, Meliades gart hir maistres first proceid. Swa in the kirke thay enterit devotlie, And offerit thair, with heartis meiklie, Loving to God, with thanks a thowsand syse, Whilk gave tham grace to meit on sik ane wyse. When this was donne, than said Clariodus, Madame, I think that best it war for us, Unto my fatheris palice for to go. Richt as ?e will, scho said, I will do so. Then to the palice passit thay anone, And this gudewyfe they maid with them to gone. And to the getis quhen they cumin war, Clariodus then said to the portar, My freind, we thre hes erand with the Lord, Of quhilk he wald be glaid to heir record; Whairfor I wald ?ow pray gif us entrie Within ?our ?et, to remaine quhile ?e Our erand did, praying him speciallie, To cum and speik with us all privilie. The portar let them enter in anone, Richt as thay bad he to the Earle is gone, And said as they him ordanit in all thing; And he alsweith withouttin tarying, Tuike with him bot ane varlot and no mo, Syne to the porteris ludge culd to them go. And quhen Clariodus [thair] can him se, Adoun he sat alsweith upon his kne. Meliades and hir maistres also Sat still and held them quyet ?ond them fro. He helsit hes his Father reverentlie. This Lord beheld his Sone, and haistilie Him knew, and was amervellit for to se Him disfigurat in so low degrie. He said to him, My sone, Clariodus, How and quhat fassioun ar ?e rewlit thus? Whair beine ?our valiant actis and renoune, ?our fame proclamit in ilk regioun, That standis now in sik ane puire estait, But companie thus walking dissolat? He said, My Lord, the litill valiant deid That in me was, withoutin ony dreid As ?it I have not tint it in no wayis. And then anone his Father gart him ryse, And set him doun to rest thair him besyde, Efter his ganging, quhilk was wount to ryde. Then told he him, with ever ilk circumstance, All haill the maner to the uterance, Of all Meliades adversitie and wo. And rycht as he was telling how that scho Was led into the forrest to be slaine, This Lord micht not conteine for wo and paine; Bot as ane wode man raif his hair for teine, With sorrowfull teiris rining from his eine, For than he traistit that scho had beine dead, And murtherit in the forrest but remeid. Then said Clariodus, My Lord, finally, My taill not to end [fullie] brocht have I, Heir quhat I sall ?it of hir farther say; This Ladie that so verteous beine ay, God wald not suffer of his grit mercie, Hir to be slaine that tyme so cruellie: The burriouris of hir had sik pitie, That thay micht not do sik ane crueltie, As with thair handis sik ane virgine slo; Bot aff the land thay gart promit to go, That scho sould never be seine in that cuntrie. And so furth all the maner told hes he, Of all the eventours that hir befell, And how so long in Estur scho did dwell, And quhat of travell hir betyde also, And how that he in exyle thocht to go. And quhair is my Ladie, quoth Earle Estur, That hes betyde sa mony aventure? If that ?e list with hir to speik, quoth he, Besyd ?ow sitting heir ?e may hir se. And quhen this Lord hes hard of this tyding, To hir he passit, lowlie inclyning, And in his armis imbracit hir tenderlie, And kissit hir rycht oft and freindfullie, Having more joy and glaidnes hir to se, Nor ony sight that ever he saw with ey. He said, Madam, I thanke the Trinitie, That ?e have chapit this infirmitie; That it was ?e, quhy told ?e not, alleace! This uther day quhen ?e war in my place, That I said ?e resemblit in bewtie To sik ane Ladie, if ?e rememberit be? He did hir welcum with grit reverence, As he that was full glaid of hir presence, And of the cuming of his Sone also; Then all to chalmer togidder thay did go. The Earle himself is for the Countes went, And told hir all the maner and event. Scho is unto them cumit haistilie, And thair scho salust this Ladie courteslie, And thocht scho was in full simpill aray, Scho did hir honour grit, the suith to say, And welcumit hir fair on lawlie wayis, And scho againe hes thankit [hir] oft sayis. Clariodus scho tuike in armis syne. I can not all the maner to ?ow defyne, Nor tell ?ow half the joy was thame amang. Knichtis and Ladies thair about thame thrang, Them welcuming with freindlie countinance. This was ane day of feisting and plesance, The nicht owerpast with joy and mirrines; And on the morrow with full grite bissines, The Earle gart ordane claithes rich and fair Of gold and silke, [maist] plesant and preclair, With rich furringis coastlie and pretious, Both for this Ladie and for Clariodus, In all the haist and speid that [weill] thay may. Meliades, that wyse and honorabill was ay, Requyrit hes the Earle richt humbillie, That his Ladie in bed micht with hir ly, Into ane chalmer onlie be them sellis, Whair none war bot Ladies and damosellis. The Earle hir grantit hes with cheir bening, And thairof hir commendit in mekill thing. Syne on the morne quhen tyme was [for] to ryse, Rich cloathes of gold most richlie to devyse, Thay brocht unto Meliades the bricht; And to hir Maistres eik as it was rycht, Thay brocht ane goune of skarlot gud and fyne, That was weill furrit with potent rich armyne. Then blyth was this gudwyfe of hir livaray, The quhilk unto Meliades can say, Madam, I thanke ?our Ladyschip heartlie, That me hes gart reuaird [thus] so richlie; So askit leave to pas hame to hir house, Quhilk scho hir grantit with countinance joyous, Saying, ?e mone cum oft and vissie me; Or we depairt ?e sall rewairdit be Far better be sik sevin; and then heartlie Scho hir imbracit, and kissit tenderlie. Clariodus upon the same maneir, With cloathes that was pretious and deir, Servit was in his chalmer royallie; To quhom ane barbour com [full] bissilie, And off he shouife his lang hairis [all] cleine, That weill long space upon his beard had beine. Syne lustillie he did his geir on dres, As flour of Knichtheid and of gentilnes. The Earle unto Meliades is went, And said, Madame, it war convenient Unto the kirk to go all in effeir, And to gif thankis in all devot maneir To God, that did so mekill for ?ow provide. This Ladie said, we awcht baith tyme and tyde To praise the Lord, that ws so happie maid. This being said, no longer thay abaid. Then be the arme he tuike Meliades, The Court all followit upon gudlie wayis. The pepill gatherit in grit plentie, This strange Ladie and Princes for to se; Thay hir [bricht] bewtie gritlie did commend, And said, And seike unto the worldis end, Thair micht no man se sik ane [gudelie] sicht, As for ane lustie Ladie and ane Knicht, Nor for to luike upon that fair Princes, And on this Knicht, quhilk wicht and worthie was. Scho enteris in the kirk, and [eke] anone The Countes meiklie efter hir is gone, With hir ane Lady fair and weil beseine. This Princes was honourit as ane Queine, The quhilk hir held so [wise and] demurlie At hir devotioun, and so womanlie, With so grit constancie and devote cheir, Bening of luike, and womanlie of maneir, That to the pepill weill it micht be seine, That scho ane michtie Kingis dochter beine, And was discendit of ane nobill hous. When they had endit thair devotioun thus, The nobill Earle hir be the armis tuike, And with ane humbill countinance and luike To Palice ar returnit demurlie, And hame them followit all the companie. Be than was all the denner redie dicht, And to the hall assendit everie Knicht, And went to meit and fuire rycht nobillie. Thair was ane mirrie sound of menstrellie, With interludis and songis of Ladies bricht. Syne efter denner passit everie wicht To chalmer quhair thay plisantlie disport; Full glaid and joyous was this lustie sort. The Earle unto Meliades is went, And said, Madame, it war expedient That I furth send to ?our Father the King Ane pursevant, to tell him this tything. The Ladie said, It war my will doutles, The souner the better as I [do] ges. Ane Pursevant belyve gart he [there] call, And his intent to him declairit all; And at Meliades syne speirit he, What scho wald bide him say to that cuntrie. Than said scho, Freind, [I bid,] with bening face, ?e me commend unto my Fatheris Grace, And to my Ladie eike my Mother the Queine, And unto everie Lord and Ladie scheine That hes me kend; and me commend also To Romaryn and Bonvaleir they two; And ?e sall say unto my Father the King, And to my Mother eike, that, God willing, I sall returne to them with more blythnes Nor I did from them pairt. Quhen this said was, The Pursevant delyverlie furth went, And left the Court in joyis permanent. The Earle was joyous, and his Ladie eike, Of the recovering of this Princes meike, And of the cuming of thair Sone also: Clariodus was blisfull out of wo, That so had fundin fair Meliades: [And no less blisfull this ?oung Ladie wes,] That scho had gottine Clariodus hir Knicht; Hir wofull heart was raisit upon height, That stude before so deipe into distres; Bot ?it for all hir joy and grit glaidnes In constant leving so weill scho did conteine, That be hir cheir it micht not knowin beine, As scho that was discendit of royall bluid; For both of vertew and of pulcritude In warld scho stuid without comparisoune, Of all Princes, Bewtie from the starris doune, Whom with grit joy in Estur I let dwell, And now of uther thingis speik I will, Of Philippone, and of his Court also, And thus out of the Third Buik [will] I go. THE FOURT BUIK OF CLARIODUS. Erle Esturis Pursevant felt no raige Into the sea, bot had ane fair voyage, And at Belvilladoun [he] did aryve, And enterit in the ostlarie belyve, Whair that Clariodus was wount to be; And alse soune as the ostlar can him sie, He speirit in quhat cuntrie he did dwell, And of his tydingis prayit him to tell. I am cumit, quoth he, from Estur land, And if ?e list for to heir [my] tydand, My Lord I left in gude prosperitie, My Ladie eike, and all thair fair mein?e; Whair that I left my Lord Clariodus, Wha never was glaider nor [mair] joyous; Whair I left eike Meliades the scheine, Wha Air and Princes of this regioun beine; Thair scho is treittit nobillie at all, As ony Queine in hir estait royall, Wha heartlie greting unto ?ow me sendis; And eik Clariodus him recommendis To ?ow and to [his freind] Allan also. And quhen the [worthie] host hard him say so, That fair Meliades was ?it on lyve, He than was in joy sa exultive, That of him self almaist he wist no thing; The Lord, he said, the Celestiall King Mote ?ow conserve [for] ever more I pray, For ?our gud tydings in this house this day; If it [may] please ?ow go unto the King, ?e sall convoyit be but tarying. He maid him for to dyne, and than anone To the Palice togidder ar thay gone. Whan that the King in chalmer thair thay fand, The Host said, Sir, heir is an Pursephand, That unto ?ow can schaw the best tyding, That ever I hard of in my leving. He said, that he was welcum; and than alsweith Commandit him his creddence for to kyth. The Pursephant sat doun upon his knie, And said, Sir, the eternall God ?ow se, From Estur cuntrie I am cumit heir, Sent from Meliades ?our onlie dochter deir, Whilk heartlie gretis ?ow in humbill wayis, And recommendis hir ane thowsand sayis Unto ?our Grace and to my Lady the Queine, And alse to everilk Lord and Lady scheine Of all ?our Court, both unto more and les, With all hir mynde and heartis humblenes; And that scho fairis weill I ?ow assure, And lovit is of everie creatoure. When that the King had hard this blyth tyding, For ouer grit joy and heastie conforting, His spreit was [all to] reft ane quhyle him fro; Syne to the hevin he held his handis two, Louing to God giveing ane weill lang space; In armis syne he did with joy imbrace The Pursevant, and said, My freind so deire, Rycht happie tydings have ?e brocht us heir. The foure fellowis of Sir Clariodus Full glaid was of this tyding and joyous. In chalmer evill disposit was the Queine, For sorrow and cair ay seike [scho] had beine Sen efter the murther of Meliades, Whilk was hir told in so cruell wayis. When scho thir tydings hard, scho rose anone, And to the Kingis chalmer is scho gone, Led be two Knichts, for scho was wonder waike; The Pursevant in armis scho did take; And scho, that micht not speike ane weill lang space, Full oft scho thankit God of his gude grace. Romaryn was full blyth of this to heir, And eik so was hir varlot Bonvaleir. The word of this same thing [did] spred so fast, Whill fillit was the Palice at the last, Of pepill thringing [tydings] for to heir, With heartis blyth in blisfull sound and cheir. Both King and Queine, with lord and ladie faire, And all the pepill that beine gatherit thair, Unto the Kirk thay ?eid with ane consent, Devote of mynd and humbil of intent, And God thay thankit wonder heartfullie, That of his grace and of his grit mercie From daith preservit had Meliades. The word is gone upon [full] haistie wayis Out throw the toun, that scho was ?it on lyve; Then all the bellis ringin war belyve Of everie kirke that beine within the toune, With monie ane Prelat in processioun. This being donne, the King to Paleice went, With monie ane lord and ladie reverent; The Pursevant thay feistit royallie, And cherist him richt fair and tenderlie. This day thay did bot play, [and] feist, and dance, With joyous hearts fulfillit of plesance. Thir tydings spred full soune throw the cuntrie, And everie wight of hie and low degre Was blyth thairof, and said, No ferlie beine, That scho that was of everilk vertew Queine, Devoid of vice and everilk villanie, Was so escaipit from the tyrannie Of crewell folkis, and evill devysit mynd; God wald not suffer hir of sik ane kynd Distroyit be, quhilke beine of bewtie rose, And of all womanheid the only chose. The King had ?it ane litill jeloussie, This taill could nocht his mynd all satisfie; He gart be callit the foure murthereris, And all the cace at lenth he at thame speiris, How with his onlie bairne that thay hade wrocht, Commanding that thay sould dissimull nocht. Thay sat all foure upon thair kneis doune, And anone begane to schaw the fassioun, Saying, Our gratious Prince and soverane Lord, To ?our Hienes the trewth we sall record. We went with hir as [that] Sir Thomas bade, Him to displeis forsuith we war full rade; And quhen within the forrest we hir led, Scho of hir lyfe full mekill was adred, And on hir kneis beninglie askit grace, With pitious teiris rolling on hir face. We said that scho behuifit to be deid, Or than our selfs to die without remeid. Scho askit licence than for Godis saike, To suffer hir ane quhile hir prayeris make; Ane litill space scho passit from us than, And unto God hir orisoun begane. We drew behind hir privily to heir What scho wald say, and hard the haill maneir; And syne we knew be hir confessioun, That innocent scho was of all trasoun, To God scho did so pitiouslie compleine. Then verie rewth our heartis did constraine For to doe mercie to that Ladie sweit, That asking mercie wofullie did greit: We gart hir sweir out of this realme to go, As we that not for pitie micht hir slo; As naine on lyve in all this world, I wait, That had hir seine as we in sike estait, Albeit he sould have tint his awin lyfe, Than micht have drawin hir bluid with ane knyfe. And quhen scho saw we did sik grace hir till, Scho hir dispuil?eit of hir awin fre will, And to us gave hir kirtell of velvot blake, And eik hir chaine, and bade in patience take; To hold hir sarke on hir scho askit leave, As scho that had no thing mair us to geive. Rycht sa to go fra us scho was content, We dreid that scho with thorne and breer be schent. The King this heirand weipit pitiouslie, For everie word that he hard specifie Out throw his heart did as ane arow gleid. He callit on ane servant him besyd, And gart ane thowsand merkis [to] them give, Becaus thay sufferit his only doghter leive. He thankit them, and[eike] tuik from them thair The vyle unhonest office that thay baire; Syne gave them offices of maire honoure, And maid them men of substance and valour. When this was donne, he was content at all; His foure maisteris of houshald gart he call, And bad thay sould gar ordane haistilie Two chariots, arayit [full] richlie With gold, and silke, and pretious workis seir, With nobill palfrays thairto, as did effeire, For to bring hame his dochter from Estur; And bad thay sould gar wryt with bissie cure Unto his vassoullis ouer all the regioun, And to his Knichtis grittest of renowne, That war of most nobilitie and fame, For to compeir at Bellvilladoun be name. The letteris being directit, richt anone The forsaids Earls can them all dispone To cum upon thair most gudlie wyse Unto this toune, as ?e have hard devyse. Within ten dayis thay war all redie dight, Be sea and land they sped them at thair might. At Bellvilladoun they did anone aryve; Nobiller Knichtis was thair none on lyve Nor was into that nobill companie; Sir Panse de Lapre, [ane knight] full worthie, Sir Ronar de Galt, ane knight of nobill fame, Sir Lion de la Mont [as] height his name, Sir Bruse de la Woy thair was also, Sir Broune de la Moris, and monie mo, Sir Pennent de la Carare thair was eike, With his Ladie and hir sex virgins meik, With monie uther ladie fair of face, That day aryvit [all] in that ilke place, Quhilk cumin war in thair most gudlie wyse, To ryde in court for fair Meliades. The Knightis namis heir now all to tell At this [ilk] tyme it war rycht lang to dwell. Unto the Kingis Palice ar thay went, And syne unto his Hienes are present, Whom thay have helsit with grit reverence; And syne unto the Queinis excellence Inclynit thay with bening face and cheire. The King them welcumit on fair maneire, And with them hes advysit to and fro, And at the last he said, It standis so, Meliades my doghter, as ?e knaw, Full sore beine trublit for ane traitors saw; I wint aluterlie scho had beine dead, Bot God for hir has schappin sik remeid, That scho in Estur cuntrie is on lyve: Thairfor I have sent for ?ow [all] belyve, To pase for hir, and bring hir to this land. Full glaidlie this the Knichtis tuike on hand, For thay hir lovit ouer all uther thing, For hir meiknes and womanlie having. This being donne, to supper went the King, With monie lustie lords and ladies ?ing; They feistit long, and maid full mirrie cheir. And efter that thay raise from [the] suppeir, The King ordanit thir lustie Knightis two, [Sir] Palexis and Amandour also, And two eik of his maisteris of houshold, This companie in governance to hold, And bad that thay sould rewle and gyd the leave, That in all way thay sould his honour save. He then delyverit with full meike sermoune, And gave to them of gold ane millioune, Sir Pennents Ladie lustilie beseine, And eik hir sex virginis bricht and scheine. Then Bonvaleir tuike leave with them to go; So did this lustie ladie Romaryn also, And to Meliades scho past, for suith Scho was the Ladie hir nureist had of ?outh, With monie uther ladie fresch of hew: Bonvaleir eik, that ay was [leil and] trew, Did with them go, with everie kynd servand That of befor hir servit in Ingland. When everie Lord and Ladie leave hes taine, Anone unto thair ludging are thay gaine; And on the morne as the day up cleirit, Then everie wicht him dressit as effeirit, And on thair horse ascendit but abaid, And royallie out throw the toun thai raid, With sound of trumpit and of clarioun. Blyth was the pepill that baid in the toun, For weill thay knew thair erand: ane and all Then prayit God that fair thay sould befall, And gif them grace to speid on sik ane wyse, That thay hame bring the fair Meliades, Whais palfray with the goldin taill and mene Was with them led, quhite as the snow and schene. In Turkie land I heir it was the gyse, Thair palfrayis to depaint on sik ane wyse, That from them thay will cut [baith] taill and maine, And goldin traces hing on thair againe. I wald the Reidar tuike not sik consait, That nature had wrocht them so diligate, Least that he leuch thairat, and maid ane jape, Lath ware myne Awthore to be maid thair Aip. Thus rydis furth this royall cumpanie, Thay dressit to thair shippis haistilie. Thay hade the winde so richt and eike so faire, They go alse swift as aigill in the aire, That thay within twelf dayis did aryve To Estur cuntre; and then to land belyve They went in feir, and on thair horses ascendit, And to the toun of Belladoun intendit; And on the Tuisday be the hour of noune They com to it, quhair thay discendit soune, And everilke wicht gois from his horse doune, And in the fairest Innis in the toun They tuike thair ludging. Bot so befell anone, Ane squyer of the Palice their was one Into the toun, and saw this lustie sort, Whilke home is went, and of it maid reporte Unto Clariodus, and he alse weill Unto Meliades this thing did reveill, Saying, Madame, is it ?our will to go, And take ?our leave this land of Estur fro? Scho said, My lustie Knight Clariodus, What garis ?ow speir this thing at me thus? Rather I wald, if that my fortoun were, Of Estur cuntrie for to be Ladie heire, Nor to be Queine of the grittest regioun That now is under the hevins dominioune. I will ?ow tell, quoth he, ?our Father the King Hes sent for ?ow ane companie tending Of Lordis, Knightis and of Ladies faire; Remaine ?e heir quhill I againe repaire; Now will I to my Lord my Father go, And tell him this. Then pairtit he her fro: Bot first unto his awin chalmer past he, Whair lay his riches in grit quantitie, That he had wone from Saraseins in fyght; And ane bulget he tuike of ane hudge weight, And oppinit it, and tuike of it anone Ane rich pectrell as onie star that schone; And syne unto Meliades it brocht, And to resave it fairlie hir besought, And at the entrie of the Lords it weir. And then smylling with womanlie effeire, Scho said, Clariodus my Knight full deir, May it not weill suffeice the nobill giftis seire, All that ?our Father my Cousing gave me, And eik ?our Mother in that same degrie; Bot ?e in all gait [ay] will them exceid? Now of sike thing ?e know thair is no neid. He causit eik his Mother the Countes, To treat this Lady with all bissines To take this pectrell rich for to behold. And scho in baith hir handis did it fold, And said, My Ladie, do me this plesance This pectrell to resave at my instance; With that about hir schoulders [scho] it laid; As onie lamp with blisfull beams [it] glaid. Then scho, the wall of womanlie maneir, Hes thankit them [full] oft with bening cheir. [Then] Clariodus is to the Earle went, And schew to him the maner incontinent Of all thir folkis, as ?e have hard me tell. The Countes did still in the chalmer dwell Meliades to dres into hir geir Of thingis sik as gainit for hir to weir. Scho cled hir in ane royall cloath of gold, That was richt fair and plesant to behold, And did hir heid attyre full richlie; And syne the pectrell wonder plesantlie, Scho pat about hir halse as lillie quhyte, As scho that beine the patroune of delyte Of all the warld, withoutin comparisoune, Of everilk vertew and [of hie] renoune. The Countes to hir in sporting did say, [I will me attyre all in fresch array] Againe ?one strangeris cum me for to se; Whairfor I wald be praisit in bewtie; And alse I wald [that] thay [weill] understude, That Esture Ladyis ar both faire and gude. Meliades leuch at hir that raillit so, For scho ane plesant Ladie was also. Scho did hir bodie cloath full richlie, In ane fair goun of velvote cramosie, Furrit with armeine that was nobill and fyne, And lustillie hir heid atyrrit syne. When thay had put them in ane fresch aray, Into ane plesant chalmer passit thay, And thair abaid with all the lustie sorte, Making full merrie gamis and disporte, Whill tyme beine to fetch them to the hall; Of the ambassate was thair speiches all. Clariodus at his Fatheris commande Two maisteris of his houshald hes ordand To go and fetch the lustie companie. And thay anone are passit full glaidlie, With squyeris and with knightis fresch and ?ing; And he to thame command gave and biding. The Count of Esture that was gentill and wyse Then be the arme hes taine Meliades, And led hir to the hall rycht honorablie, And scho [unto] him told all quyetlie Of the riche gift Clariodus hir gave. Then said the Count, Madam, so God me save, My sone I lovit tenderlie before; Bot for that now I love him far the more, To doe service to Ladies honorabill, Sen that I understand he is [richt] abill. They had not talkit long on this wayis, When the ambassat, gudlie to devyse, In fair maneir assendit in the hall. And than in presence thair com first of all Sir Amandur and [eik] Sir Palexis; And syne two Lordis of grite worthines, That maisteris of houshald war unto the Kinge. Helsit thay have the ?oung Princes condinge; And scho resavit them with plesant cheire, With faire effeir and womanlie maneir, Soberlie saying, ?e all welcum beine. Scho kissit them, with teiris from hir eine. The Knichtis two then weipit tenderlie For joy and pitie of the fair Ladie, That saikleslie had sufferit sik distres. Syne halsit they the Count and the Countes. The Kings two maisteris of houshold syne Full lowlie to the Ladie did inclyne. Scho tham resavit with joy and grit plisance, And kissit them with gudlie countinance. Syne halsit they the Earle, and he thame eike; And syne with everie Lord and Ladie meike They spake at lenth, and maid thair aquentance, With heartis full of joy and all plisance. Meliades syne they tuike to ane pairt, And told how that the King with all his heart And eike the Queine did heartlie them commend To hir quhom speciallie they war [to] send For to convoy hir hame in hir cuntrie. Than how thay fair scho speirit full glaidlie; And how fure all the Court [anon] scho speirit. Then they have tauld hir all scho them requyrit. And quhen Meliades, of grit bewtie, Receavit had ilke Knight in his degrie, Then com the Ladyes full of lawlieheid, And law inclynit to hir gudlieheid; And scho resavit them with imbracing, And kissit them with countinance bening, Gyding hirself so wyse and discreitlie, With having and effeir so womanlie, That everilk wicht did boldlie hir commend. And pairt thair was with quhom scho was unkend, Long tyme before desyring hir to see, Wha than affirmit that all was veritie That was reportit of hir womanheid, Of hir great bewtie and hir lustieheid. Romaryn was with joy revest in spreit, Hir breist with blisse was so full and compleit, [With] whom dreidles Meliades the cleir Wald speik allone full faine at thaire laseire. The two maisteris of houshold of Ingland Stude with the Earle of Estur, comonand On materis langand to Meliades. Clariodus that worthie beine and wyse, Causit ?oung Lordis [for] to go and dance With ?oung Ladies of bewtie and plesance. So they put of the day with mirrines, With glaidsum sportis and with grit blythnes. The Earle stude with thir Lordis advysing; And so, among all uther commoning, Of this Princes began thay to devyse How scho sould be at poynt anone, quhat wayis, And how that all thingis sould be ordainit Of hir abuil?ement for hir estait. And then the Count of Estur said them till, ?e sall se, Lordings, if it war ?our will, What ordinit is for hir we sall go luike; And he them both into ane wairdrope tuike, And gart discover the littar that was bricht, And chariot eike that [plesantlie] cast licht, Of gold and stonis that war pretious; Unto thair sights that it was mervellous; And of hir horse the costlie harnisching Thay have commendit into mikill thing: For all that hir pertinit for to weir, Both for hir self and for hir palfray-geir, Was wrocht with stone and pearle rycht potent, Bricht twinkling as the starrie firmament. Syne with the Earle agane returnit thay, Beholding on the dansing and the play Whill tyme [it] beine to supper for to gone: And then the hall devoydit was anone Whill buird beine all coverit and arayit; And then thay went to supper and not delayit. I will not tell of [all] thair courssis heir. When they had soupit and maid mirrie cheir, Thay dansit, sang, and playit, and disporte, That long it war the maner to reporte. When tyme [it] was to bedis for to gone, Lordis and Ladies tuike thair leave anone, And to thair chalmeris went to take them rest. Meliades to bed hes hir adrest, The Ladies of hir chalmer with hir went. Full glaid scho was and blyth in hir intent With Romaryn to commoune at laseire; Full long they spake of diverse matters seire; Whylome they spake of leth, quhylome of loth, Whylome they lewch and quhylome weippit both. [And] when they had long tyme commonit so, Bonvaleir scho commandit for to go At morrow to the suburbs of the toun To the Gudwyfe with quhom scho did sojorne, Commanding hir to be at hir rysing; And that scho sould the wysis with hir bring, That enterit war with hir in house to dwell. He tuike his leave and ran [full] soune to tell. He with sik diligence thir wyfes soght, That he hes them all thre unto hir brocht Be houris ten; and then, without tarying, Hir Fathers maisters of houshald gart scho bring, And said, My frindis, lo! it standis thus, When I was in my maist distres noyous, Thir wyfes me resavit and weill relevit, Or ellis I had in povertie beine mischevit; They war nixt God my comfort and refuge, Fra hunger and cauld thay maid me weill to luge: Whairfor I will ?e geive unto thir thrie Pairt of the fynance [that] is sent to me. Blyth war thir Lordis to doe as scho them bade, Thay said they sould obey with heartis glaid, To gif or to dispone at hir bidding. The wyfes was abaisit then sumthing, When they saw hir arayit on sike wayis. Then meiklie to them went Meliades, And tuike them in hir armis all about, Saying, My sweit freindis, have ?e no doubt Bot I sall be to ?ow ane doghter trew, And cum quhen that ?e list me to persew, ?e salbe supportit [all thrie] richlie. All kneilling, they hir thankit courteslie. Scho gart delyverit be unto thir thrie, Of gold, and silver, and [of] gud monie Alse mikill as wald by of heritage Thrie hundereth merkis worth to thair waige; And gart be gevine unto them also Ane thowsand pund or scho wald pairt them fro, To by thair misteris. And thir wyfis thrie Oft thankit hir with voices upon hie, Saying, Scho was to them ane thankfull gaist, That them unto sik riches had possest; Praying to God and to his Sone so sweit, Ever to keipe hir in bodie and in spreit. Thay tuike thair leave and hamwart [than] could go. Rycht syne scho hes commandit thir maisteris two, That of that Palice everie servitoure Sould be rewairdit with gold and grit trasoure. And so was donne with sike [ane] abundance, That thay thairefter had ay in remembrance: Whairfor the Count and the Countes also Full humbillie hir thankit baith thir two. Scho said, ?e sould no thankis gif to me; Bot ?e of me sould mekill thankit be, That am to ?ow beholdin in sike wayis. With this the gudlie fresche Meliades, Out of ane coffer tuike, riche to behold, Two gudlie collors of the finest gold, Saying, ?e two in my rememberance Sall weir thir colloris, if it be ?our plesance. Thay thankit hir, and said thay sould glaidlie Resave them for hir saike, that was worthie, And all thair lyfe keip them in [hie] daintie, In the rememberance of hir blyth bewtie. And syne scho gart draw furth ane coursour faire, In all the warld was not ane gudlier, And gart Bonvaleir hir servant him resave, And to Clariodus anone him gave; Whairof he thankit [hir ]rycht courteslie, And hir varlot rewairdit michtilie. When this was donne, thay passit for to dyne; And maid them reddie for thair jornay syne. Meliades is passit af the toun, With all hir companie of grite renoune; Full monie ane Lord and Lady hir convoyit, In cloth of gold full richlie arayit. Scho wore ane hate full riche upon hir heade, Whilk shynit of sapheiris and of roobies reide, Ane rich pectrell about hir schoulderis hang, Hir costlie brydell all of gold it rang; And heich upon the litter was scho set, Whilk was with stonis and pearles all owerfret, With cussiounis wrocht with cloath of gold full fyne; Scho schynit as dois the fairest star matutyne. All voyde befor hir com ane chariot bricht Of michtie stonis, casting plesant licht, Hir palfray with the goldin maine and taill, Hir varlot cled in royall apparrell. Syne ten Ladies on ten palfrayis quhyte Com efter hir, quhom to sie was delyte. The Ladie Estur, and Ladie de la Grance, And Ladie de la Cariar of plesance, Upon ane chariot sat in gudlie wayis, The quhilk the King sent to Meliades. The leave com efter syne weill ordinat, In chariots frechlie efter thair estaite. The silver trumpits blew with merie sound, In joy and blisse this companie furth bound. The peiple bad God be in thair companie, [And weipit for the love of this Ladie.] Clariodus ane quhile behind thame baid, Garring be tursit the thesawre that he hade Intill Syprus win from the Turkis strong; Bot he owertuike them or it was ocht long, And to the Count his father thus he said, My Lord, I think it speidfull that we raid Throw France, for it is the most plesant way; And heirupon accordit all beine they. Thus towardis France they raid all in feir, And so they have them sped in sik maneire That in schort tyme thay com to Sant Dynice. Thay lichtit thair and tuike ane gudlie Innis, Whair thay ane day and eike ane nicht reposit, Whom for to se the peipill all rejosit; Whair thair was of the Kingis Court ane Knight, Quhilke them espyit evin as they did licht, And speirit them; and quhen he understude The Ladies name of plesant pulchritude, And quhat the lordis and ladies with hir beine, Ane fairer sight he thoght he had never seine. Unto the King he raid or he wald bline, And told him all the maner and the meine, What that thay war, and how thay war arayit. The nobill King no longer than delayit; Bot haistilie sent for the Constabill, And with Court of Knichtis honorabill, He sent them for to meit, and he anone Towardis Sant Denis with his Court is gone. Be this the Court of fair Meliades On horse ascendit was on gudlie wayis, On gatwart cuming unto Parice toun, Of joyous trumpits with ane mirrie sound. The Constabill hes met and helsit them all. Syne to Meliades in speciall He passit, and hes maid his aquentance, Saying, Madame, but onie variance, Thay said the trewth that praisit ?our bewtie; For verilie, as it apeiris to me, That none ?our bewtie did so fare compryse, Bot ?e deservit more ane thowsand syse To beine commendit, and that I dar weill say. With that scho changit hew, as scho that ay Abandonit beine with [all] schame and dreid, As blossome [sueit] of bening womanheid; For scho was never manlie nor ?it pert [In ocht,] nather in plaine nor in desert. So raid thay furth with mirrie collatioun. And as thay war ane myle from Parice toun, Sex armit Knightis met they in the way, And to Clariodus soune dressit thay; Syne helsit him, and then they said him till, Sir Knight, ?e tell us, if it be ?our will, If sike ane Knight ?e know as we do seike. He answeirit them with wordis wyse and meike, What Knight is he? unto me tell his name. Clariodus, thay said, of mikill fame, The Count of Esturs sone, and eik his heare; If he be in this companie declair? We have him sought in monie seire cuntrie, For out through all the world praisit is he, Both flour of knightheid and of nobilness; And for he is of sik ane worthines, Rycht faine we wald in armis him assaill, If ony of us micht gif to him batell; And if that on micht not, [why,] then sould two; And if that two micht not, [why,] then sould mo; And if he war so abill under scheild, As to us all sex fight to gif in feild, On efter on, or with us all at onis: And thus we are him seikand for the nonis, For to assay our strength and chevalrie On him that of this warld is most worthie; And if he happin for to stryke us doune, We are content he have us to presoune; And if we fuil?e, or dois him suppryse, To take him with us in the samine wyse. To them full meiklie he answeirit thus, I am the Knight ?e call Clariodus, Bot not as ?e me call the warldis floure; For monie ane Knight thair is of mair valour: ?it nevertheles, if that it be ?our will, Anone I sall gif battell heir ?ow till. And quhen they harde, he spake sa courteslie, The mair thay him commendit verilie. When that Meliades hard this tyding, Scho was affrayit into mikill thing, And prayit God devotlie him to save, And give him grace the victorie to have. Clariodus pat on his helme anone, And with his speire is to the formost gone, And to the eard him straike withoutin ho; Syne to ane uther dressit him to go, And so him hit quhill on the ground he lyis; Syne fyve he servit on the samen wayis. The sext against him dressit fellounlie; Thir Knightis ran togidder forcilie, And brake thair speiris, and maid ane course faire. And so thir two so oft hes counterit thair, Whill [that] awght speiris [all] in sunder brake; To gif them roume the Court raid all abake, Them to behold thay had [full] grite plesance. At the sevint course, with knightlie countenance, Clariodus him hit with sik [ane] force, Whill to the eard ?eid both man and horse. Then all the Court, that was beholding by, Heigh praisit hes his nobill chevalrie. Then com the [said] sex Knightis all in feire Unto him, saying, that all the Court might heire, Sir, unto ?ow we us presoneiris ?eild, As to the nobillest Knight that ever buire scheild, To prissoun right, evin as ?e will, [leid us. Then noblie spake to them Clariodus,] Saying, ?e sall go to ?one faire prisoune, Unto ?on Ladies, and pay ?our ransoun. He tuike them be the hands on courtese wyse, And hes them led to fair Meliades. He said, Madame, resave thir presoneris, Demaine thame as to ?our estait effeiris. Then said scho meiklie to the Constabill, Call ?e it not best that I be merciabill? I wald tham freith unto thair libertie, If that it war ?our counsall, quhat say ?e? Madame, he said, I sweir ?ow be my trewth, It war ?our honour upon them to have rewth, And for to freith them [out] of ?our prissoun, Now at ?our entrie into Parice toun. Then said scho thus, Fair Siris, for his saik That unto me ?ow presoners did make, I gif ?ow fredome heir of my presoun. They thankit hir with [richt] bening sermoune. And syne unto Clariodus they went, And ane of them thus spake with meike intent; O floure of knightheid and of chevalrie, We have ?ow sought full long and bissily, And now we have fund ?ow of grit valouris, All to ?our worschip and nothing unto ouris; Heir we us offer to ?our service and thrall, Full hie we sall exalt ?our name ower all; We wer borne in the cuntrie of Polyne, Cadnox de Halt my name is for certaine. He namit all his fellowis namis syne, And wald have taine thair leave and could inclyne. Then he requyrit them with all his heart For to abyde; and tuike them in ane pairt, And of his purse furth hes [he] taine anone Sex diamonts as onie lampe that schone; And said, My freindis, heartlie I requyre This litill mater to have of me heire; Thir diamonds than sall ?e of me taike, And have them to ?our Ladies for my saike: Quhilk thay resavit, thanking him oft syse, Saying, The honouris and the grit impryse That him was gevin, it was not all for nought. Thay tuike thair leave and hamwart ar they sought. The French Knightis, quhen this thing thay had seine, His maners with them gritlie praisit beine. Then royallie to the toun furth thay raide, And to the Kingis Palice but abaid They have them sped, [and] then doun all thay licht. The Constabill hes taine this Ladie bright, And hes with hir ascendit to the hall, Whair the King was with monie lord royall, And eike the Queine with monie ladie fair, All still abyding on thair cuming thair: For the King was never into houshold, Within four hundereth [of] Knightis bold; The Queine also, as sayis myne Authore eike, Was never within ane hundereth Ladies meike. Scho salust hes the King full courteslie, And he did hir resave richt gentillie, And kissit hir, saying, Madame, but dreid Full welcum beine to us ?our nobilheid; For we have longit all in this cuntrie, ?our bright imperiall bewtie for to se, Whom we of sikane vertew hard reporte; ?e beine full welcum heir and all ?our sorte: Whairof scho thankit him full reverentlie. And syne the Queine hir halsit womanlie, The quhilk full honorabillie did hir resave. The King hartilie resavit all the leave, And did them welcume with countinance joyous, And specialie the gud Clariodus; He maid to him grit cheir and welcuming, Whom he desyrit to se abone all thing. The King hes taine the Count of Estur land, And weill long space stude with him commonand. The Queine hir self and Dame Meliades, Held commoning on [the] most gudlie wayis; In whom the Queine sik wit and nurture fand, Sik prudence and sik vertew aboundand, Scho trowit, in warld nether be north nor south, Might not be fund in sik ane tender ?outh Sik wit, not ?it sik womanlie maneir; Scho held hir thairfor abone all woman deire. Amongs all uther thingis, Earle Estur Schew to the King the pitious aventur, And eike distressis of this Ladie frie; Whairat the King [soir] weipit for pitie. Thairefter said he to Clariodus, Fair Sir, ?e beine full welcum unto us; For grit report I have hard of ?ow maid, How in this world, that is baith long and braid, Leifis no Knight nobiller of renoune As ?e that beine without comparisoun. Right sa I have hard now of new reports, How that ?e, at the entrie of our ports, Aprovit hes so weill and nobillie, And donne so fair ane deid of chevalrie, That it war mervell sik ane to be seine, We thinke be ?ow our court all honorit beine. When that the King had of his talke all fynit, Clariodus him thankit and low inclynit, Saying, War I of sik [hie] praise and fame, Lyke as ?our Henes gives to my name, I war all ?ouris without ony dreid Alse long as I might ryde or sit on steid. The King imbracit him with tendernes, Saying, Also I thank ?ow of ?our ches, That out of Cyprus to the Queine ?e send; ?our fredome beine full gritlie to commend, For it ane royall present was and gift, To geive to ony Queine under the lift. Thus cherisit he Clariodus full fair, With wordis that war sweit and debonair. The King hes him aquentit haistilie With all the knightis of thair companie; And thay have with the Kingis court also Aquentit them, and semblit two and two. They can disport and speike of diverse things, So that the mekill hall with joy all rings Of minstrallie and uther mirthes eike; Na solace beine amongis them for to seike. To chalmer [syne thay] went, and thair ane space Abaid thay quhile the supper redie was, The grit triumphis and burdes coverit beine. Then to the hall is went baith King and Queine, And eike this princes digne and honorabill. The nobill King anone begane the tabill, Befor him set Meliades the scheine; Into ane chyre abone him sat the Queine; At the buird heid they set the Earle Esture; Syne everilk lord and ladie in ordour, Efter thair awin degreis war thay set. Ay at the dyse ane knight and ladie met. The Constabill hes taine Clariodus, And his four fellowis that war chevelrus, And all the knightis of his companie, And led them to ane chalmer full glaidlie, And feistit them on mervellous maneir, All haill with diligats and coursis seire. Then maid thay joy and fuire ryght mirrilie, And menstrellis sang and playit curiouslie. Alse of the letter course they servit ware, All be sex plesant ladyis of bewtie cleire, And with aucht knightis convoyit royallie And awght squyeris [that were] ?eing and lustie, Come to the King, and thair ane Poune present, Saying to him thir words in verament, Sir, to this Poune ?e do as it effeiris. This nobill King quhen he thir wordis heiris, Upon this wayis, quoth he, heir I avow, Unto the Poune and Ladyis unto ?ow, The fairest justing the morne I sall devyse In honour of Madame Meliades That ever was into my tyme in France, Thairin sall be no let nor variance. When this was said, the Ladyis reverent, Unto the Queine the Poune thay did present. And I avow, unto the Poune, quoth sche, When Sir Clariodus sall mareit be, That I and all my Court ane feist sall make, For him and for his soverane Ladies saike. The Poune was set befor Meliades, The quhilke demurelie spak on this wayis; Heir I avow unto the Poune but dreid, When everilk Knight is armit upon steid, Efter my cuming I sall them espy, And quha with lance [than] provis most worthy, I sall gif him this hat upon my heid. And with that word scho wox a litill reid. The Poune was borne before the Earle Estur. I sall avow, quoth he, [and that] most suire, For to behold and se on bissie wayis Of everilk justing and haill interpryse, And quhasa passis other in bountie, I sall declair if it be speirit at me. And syne unto the Countes of Estur The Poune was borne; and scho with speach demure Said to the Poune, I vow and heightis thus, At mariage of my sonne Clariodus, In my best cloathing I sall me aray, And never mair againe efter that day; I salbe furrit then with grice allone, For now the bÃ© of my ?outhheid is gone. Syne efter this the Poune went throw the hall, And thay richt honorabillie avowit all. Syne to the Constabillis chalmer [they] it baire, And said to him, My Lord, aquyte ?ow thair. I [sall] avow, quoth he, quhen everie Knight On the justing day salbe arayit richt, That sax Knightis I sall put from thair steidis, Or them unhelme, thoght that be cleir in weidis. The Powne they buire befor Clariodus, And he with gudlie maner speikis thus; Heir I avow, upon the justing day That I sall just, if weild ane speire I may. Then hes the Ladyis to Sir Amandour The Powne presentit, and set it him before. And I avow, quoth he, upon the greine When everie Knight on horse inarmit beine, From aucht Knightis I sall stryke [doun] awcht scheilds, And skatter them full wyde into the feilds. And to Palexis they the Poune [did] bring. I avow, quoth he, to Cupide lovis king, When everilk Knight enarmit beine in weids, That nyne Knightis I sall stryke from thair steids. Unto ane French Knight [then] the Powne brocht thay, That was full fearce and hardie at assay, The quhilk Sir Charles height De les Carere. And I avow, quoth he, on this maner, When all fellowis beiris plait and maill, Than [ten] Knightis in preise I sall assaill, And ten speiris eik I sall breke assunder, Or sum of us sall ly our steidis under. Then to Sir Broune [hecht] de la Amouris The Poune they brought, for he was amourus; The quhilk avowit ane gantellit to weir Upon the hand quhair with he ran his speir. Sir Pennent de Carare, [ay] bold and wicht, Nixt him avowit as ane lustie Knight, That he sould be enarmit all in greine, For the love only of his Ladie scheine. All thair avows war long for to declaire, How everilk Knight avowit that was thaire. When that the Knightis had avowit all, The Ladyis buire the Poune unto the hall, Whair that they lewch with heartis glaid and licht, Rehearsing the avows of everilk Knight. When all was rissine and gone from supper, Unto Clariodus on this maneir The Constabill said, Be ?our avow it seimis ?e sall not just the morne, for so men deimis. Then said Clariodus, Not just I may, For I am hurt upon the hand perfey With [the] sex Knightis at our last justing. And quhen it was rehearsit to the King, He was forsuith thairof nothing joyous; For he had rather seine Clariodus Ane speir have run all right and under scheild, Nor all the Knightis that wald cum to feild. With this thay all unto thair chalmer went, Up gois the sound of hevinlie instrument. Lordis and Ladies anon gois to the dance; The nobill King with gudlie countinance Meliades hes taikine by the hande; Clariodus the Quein at his command; And syne the nobill Lord [the] Constabill Led the Countes of Estur honorabill; And uther Lordis ?oung and rycht lustie Gois to the dance with Ladies by and by. In joy and pleasour was the lustie sorte. Thus quhill bed tyme full glaidlie thay disporte. The Lordis then causit fetche spyce and wyne. Meliades tuik leave, to bed dressit syne; The Lordis eike at the King and [the] Queine, And went to chalmer with thir Ladyis scheine; Whom to the Queine did say, I pray that ?e Be airlie up, the justing for to se. Madame, qwoth scho, I salbe, and bad gud night. And then anone to bed went everie Knight. At morrow as the larke begowth to sing, Awalks the lustie Lords and Knichtis ?eing, That hes avowis maid on this maneir, And all anone thay beine enarmit cleir: Alsweith thay servit God and tuike disjune, And maid them redie for the counter soune. The King also was redie thame to se. The Queine with great triumph and royaltie Arayit hir the justing for to seine, With all hir lustie Ladies [faire and] scheine. Hir goun was of the cloath of gold potent, And circulat with stonis redolent. Full michtilie arayit was hir heid, Hir collour schew as rosis quhyt and reid. Scho wore ane croune of gold mekill of pryce, In quhilke thair schynit monie flour de lyce. Hir Ladyis war abul?eit richlie, And put to poynt richt weill and royallie. They servit God and disjunit syne, Meliades, the lustie ?oung Rosyne, As Mayis blossome newlie brokin quhyte, Adressit hir as goddes of delyte, Arrayit hir as of Ingland the gyse, Becuming hir upon most gudlie wayis, Alse quhyt as snow of satine was hir goune, Raisit with gold richt curious of fassioune, With giltine traisis hang doun leming licht; Hir hat was of the gold all birneist bricht; Hir belt was all of michtie stonnis plantit, No poynt of bewtie nature on hir scantit; For scho hir paintit as Goddes devine, Alse bright as Diane, or as Apolleine, In cloath of gold hir Ladies war beseine, Hir damosellis in quhyt satine scheine Arrayit war, in suit all fair to se. This flour of ?owth and Princes of bewtie, Unto the Queine scho went debonarlie, Hir followit all hir Ladyis by and by. The Queine commendit the gyse of thair clothing, And so did all the Court of Ladies ?ing. Syne furth they went all into ane greine meid, Whair hovit monie nobill Knight on steid, With speir in hand, [and] cumming for to range To the assay, that seimit nothing ftrange; Whair that the King him self [alse] thair abaid, With cloath of gold all stintit and ouerlaid. The Queinis scaffold neir besyd it stude, Whilk schynit all of pleasant pulcritude, With goldin torris and goldin chainis cleir, Whilk leimit licht as Phebus in his speire; Thairin assendit hes the lustie Queine, Meliades and all hir Ladies scheine. The King gart in ane scaffold by him neir Earle Estur sit, and auncient Lordis seir, For to be judge quha provit knightliest, And tell quha thair avowis keipit best. Unto the preise the pepill them adrest, Thair heartis all in curage than increst; Thair bright enarming, cleir as [the] cristall, Against Phebus bright birned as bereall; As glorious angellis thay gleimit on thair steidis, Whill all the land leimit of thair weidis. Among them was Clariodus the Knight Inarmit on steid, unwitting of ony wight; The cause thairof befor ?e hard me say, For thay all trowit he sould not just that day. Of all the rout was no man thair him knew. For, the more strange, of quhyt was all his hew, His scheild, his speir, himself, and eike his steid, His servitouris was in the samin weid. This Knight he held him quyet at ane syde, Beholding them quhilk still did ay abyde. The Constabill com first to the assay, Full weill at poynt and in knightlie aray. He was all ower inarmit into blew; His servitouris war in the samine hew. He had into his thimber, fair be sight, Ane lustie madine with giltine traces bright, Hir ?ellow hairis keaming as the wyre. As pecoke fetherum was hir buske alse faire; Pouderit with stonis as the hevinis stellat About his helme ane cirkill deaureat. His mightie speir he gripis in his hand, And as ane boare abraiding out of band, He spurrit forward his avow to hold. Sir Dovans de Lapri that was [full] bold, Sir Ronar, [and] Sir Lyon de Lamount, Sir Bruce de la Voy, thir foure in frunt, To hold thair avowis forward ar thay gone. Sir Amandur and Sir Palexis anone, Sir Broun de Lamours, and Sir Pennent also, Richt wounder knightlie to the preise they go. Sir Charles de Lesterer lustie under scheild, Com with his fellowis lustie in the feild. Ower long it war thair namis for to note, Thay war ane royall companie God wote. All that [did] com of justeris to the meid, Full weill at poynt inarmit [wer] on steid. Knightlie and fair the justing they begane; Full monie fair and royall course thay ran. They met so fearcelie that it was wonder; Both heir and thair the speiris gois in sunder; Up gois the trenschers in the air on height, Doune gois the horse and the inarmit knight; Out gois the fyre from scheilds as reid as gleid, Off gois the helmis falling in the meid; Syne gois the scheildis to brist in two; The sound of trumpits never could to ho, With weirlyk soundis could thay blow on height; The knichtis met with monie ane hit unlicht, Whair of the rearde raise with sike ane sound, Whill all at onis dynit Parice toun. Monie knightis was thair of full grit strenth; I can not schaw ?ow on ane dayis lenth Thair nobill deidis richt nobill to praise, Nor as I aucht thair nobill fame up raise. Clariodus that saw the manlie faire, Within his breist his courage waxit maire; Then he him put with them that war thairin, For he them waiker thought and waxand thin; Doune gois the speir [that was] both grit and wicht, In gois the spuris that of gold was bright In the sydis of his steid, quhilk swiftlie rane, Thair he to just full royallie begane. Before his speir the knightis gois to grund, Whill from the meid the helmes did redound; Or he wald rest he ruffellit thair atyre, Out of the steill befor him start the fyre; The knightis lay befor him on the greine; Might no man sit on sadell and susteine His mightie straike, bot him behuisit fall, And he in sadell sat as ony wall. Thay thoght he sat on steid invisibill, As campion in armis invinsibill. Full corpolent he was with breist ursyne, With masculine heart and sperit leonine; Fullfillit of vigoure and of fortitude, And he in formeheid full of pulchritude. Of his knightheid quhat beine thair maire to saine, His potent lanse might no man sit againe, Sa fra thair steidis he maid them to declyne; As beistis small befor the wolfe rampine, Alse faine they war his stroaks for to evaid; Full roume wayis thay maid him quhair he raid. He all to fruschit steidis on the greine, He tumit sadills to the number of fyftine Right at his entrie within ane litill thraw, That thay about had ferlie that him saw. When that the King had seine his gudlie fair, And how so wonder knightlie he him baire, He ferliet grittumlie quha it sould be; For never in all his lyftyme seine had he Ane knight in armis prove so worthilie. Rycht so thoght all that plesand companie. Full royall justing amongs them might be seine; For monie ane knight enarmit fair and scheine Myght men behold [then] into the greine meid, That duchtie war and valiant of thair deid. The Lord Constabill he provit weill that day, For monie ane faire course he maid perfay. His vow he keipit as ane nobill knight; For he devoidit of thair helmis bright, Sax armit knightis [all] of grit valoure. Sir Amandur full weill did his devoir; Sevin scheildis from sevin knights he strake. And Sir Palexis strong as ony aike, To grund he put nyne knightis from thair steidis; For he full worthie was in all his deidis. And schortlie for to tell ?ow [all] the trewth, Than everie knight aquyt [him] weill of slewth, And his avow weill keipit that he maid; And all that war about the samen said, And that befor that day thay never saw Sa monie lustie knights rining on raw. And most of all the Quhyt Knyght is praisit, Thay have his name to the staris raisit; For on that day, his knightlie governance Will never with them forgottine be in France: For he, that was without comparisoun Than leveing under Mars his regioun, So wonder knightlie all the day continuit, And eik so mekill travell he susteinit, Unfatigat, unweirie, and unfaint, That I can not ?ow wryte nor ?it depaint His worthie deidis and nobilnes at all, That beine of knightheid floure imperiall: For as the awfull lyoun beirs the croune, I meane of beits, as terrestriall campioun; So is he alse stronge of all etheriall myndis, Beine lord and king, thair pryde so he declynis, As prince of knightheid and floure of chevalrie Of all this wyde warld alluterlie. Grite ferlie had the King quhat he sould be, That was of sike ane wonderfull bewtie. He considderit that the strong Clariodus, Whilk holdin was of knightheid chevalrus, That day hade he not justit nor borne scheild; For gif that he that day hade beine in feild, He wald but dreid have said it had beine he; The King hade full grit plesance him to se. The Queine also full gritlie did him praise, And unto faire Meliades scho says, What thinke ?e of the Quhyt Knight of renowne, That now he is of ?on strong fassioun? I traist firmlie that he sall have ?our hat. Thus raillit hes the Queine, and lewch thairat. Meliades then said, smyling alyte, If he it wyn, he sall it have alse tyte. Rycht full glaid scho was and rycht joyous, For weill scho wist it was Clariodus, Scho knew him be hir varlot Bonvaleir. Scho was displeasit eike in sum maneire, That he nothing before unto hir schew, That he unto the justing wald persew. His Father eik him knew be his fassioun, And had grit plesance of his hie renoune That he hard gevin him in everie syde. What sould I longer in this thing abyde; The justing still induret quhill the nicht, That to his Innis bounit everie wight. The King discendit thair incontinent; Grite number of torches hes before him went Fast to the Palice, for gone was dayis light. The Quene, and alse Meliades the bright, Discendit soune with all thair ladyis faire, And to the palice did with joy repaire. Clariodus is to his chalmer gone, And thair he hes unarmit him full soune; And thair he did on him full lustillie Ane plesant goune of velvote cramosie, And on ane hearpe begouth he for to play, As at the justing he hade not beine that day. And then the King, quhilk no tyme forget myght The nobill deidis of the ilke Quhyt Knight, He gart foure privie squyeris to him call, And bade them doe thair bissines at all Full knowledge for to get of his ludging, And great him heartilie with all cherising, Him praying to cum unto the Palace, And him disport with joy and solace With knightis and with ladies of bewtie, Saying, That welcum in the courte is he. The four squyeris passit at command To the ostlaris but farder demand, As he them bade this Knight to seike ower all. The King is enterit in the mekill hall, With monie ane lord full mekill of renoune, And richt glaidlie to supper [they] can boune. The Queine in chalmer vestit hir all new Into ane lustie goune of velvote blew, And coverit all with orpharie faire; Eike all hir ladies changit gounis thair. Meliades hir vestit in ane goune Of greine velvote, full gudlie of fassoune, Circumferat with stonis casting licht; About hir neke ane chaine of gold [full] bright. Hir hairis bright that nature span so cleire, In aureat tresis hang doun circuleir, Full angell lyke, that schynit scho with gleimis In orient bright with Phebus goldin beamis, Doun schading from hir face, that was alse quhyte As the illustar lillie of delyte. Ane rich cornall about hir hair was set, With radious stonnis mightilie overfret. What sould I tell of her feminitie; Scho strave with Venus in hir bright bewtie. Away thou Lucres with thy plesant eine, And with thy bright hairis thou Palexine, And thou faire Heline with thy hairis quhyte, And Candas with thy culloure of delyte, And with thy trewth thou [chaist] Penelope; For all this, [still] scho might ?our princes be, In vertew, bewtie, and of womanheid, ?our cleir lodstar in everie lustieheid. Hir ladies changit weidis thair also, And to the Queinis chalmer two and two Hir followit all hir damosellis be pairis, In greine satine and gold traced hearis, With pearle scheaplet thair hearis set above. Meliades with hir [fair] court of love Com to the Queine, quha did hir weill behold, Commending thair hir bewtie monifold. And thus thay past the tyme as was the gyse. With that the justeris upon gudlie wayis Enterit within the Palice of renowne, With weirlyke noyis and victorious sounde Of clariouns, trumpits, and loud minstrelly. The heraldis with ane loude voyce thay cry The namis of thir lords with grit clamouris, Under thair grit and mightie coat armouris. The King was set to supper at his tabill, With plesand lordis and ladies amiabill. The justeris in thair chalmeris soupit all, Ilk ane with other maid disporte royall, Of minstrallie and uther grit plesance. And eike the Lord Constabill of France Into his chalmer soupit hes also; And of his companie was none him fro That with him soupit had the night before, Bot Sir Clariodus; and he thairfore Displeasit was sumthing in his intent. And as the Prince most [hie and] reverent With all his lordis in hall had soupit neire, In com the foure squyeris all in feire, Quhom that the King unto the Quhyte Knight send, Sir, said thay, We mak it to be kende, That of the Quhyte Knight ?e sall have tyding; Of him we have sum knowlege and witing; And if ?e will that schawin be his name, Clariodus he height of mikill fame. And quhen the King this harde he was full blyth; Syne to the Count of Estur turnit sweith, And said, Fair Cousing, have ?e knowleging, Quha was the Knight in quhyte at [the] justing. No Sir, he said. Then I sall tell, said he, It was Clariodus ?our sonne perdie. Glaid was the King, and he commandit than, That the foure squyeris in all the heast thay can Sould go anone and fetch the Quhyte Knight. They but more, with torches birnand bricht, Soune in the chalmer of Clariodus They enterit ar, and said unto him thus, My Lord, ?our secreits no longer may be coverit, ?our counsall is [all] to the King discoverit; Heir ar we cumit at his Hienes command For ?our Lordschipe. Quoth he, Without demand I sall obey him quhill I am on lyve. Togidder are thay passit on belyve. Clariodus nocht enterit in the hall Whill soupit had this [gude] Prince royall; Bot in the chalmer of the Lord Constabill He enterit with thir Lordis honorabill. The Constabill, quhen he did him espy, Up lap he from the table demurely, And met him, saying, Quhyte Knight! Quhyt Knight! Of all the world the mirrour schyning bright, In fame of knightheid and of chevalrie The rest exceiding so excellentlie; It seimit nocht ?our hand was hurt to-day, Whilk ?our companiouns testifies perfay; It had beine gud for all the companie, That ?our hand had not hellit so suddanlie. He set him at the begyning of the tabill, And feastit him with cheir [richt] amiabill. The King causit awcht awntient Knightis go, And taike with them cuning heraldis two, And bad them be advysit on the Knights deidis, Quha war maist valiant [that day] on thair steidis, And quha maist worthie war of [hie] renoune. Thir auntient Knightis of discretioun, Ar passit furth at command of the King, With the heraulds to advyse on this thing. The King was servit with meitis amiabill, Almaist his coursis was innumerabill. The hall owerschynit [all] with torches bright, That thame among it seamit dayis licht. The intermeises long war for to tell, On quhilks as now I mynde not for to dwell. The King, quhen he hade souppit, went anone To his chalmer, quhilk [all] of torches schone. The antient Knights and the heraldis eike Com to the King, and said with wordis meike, We wald have ?our advice. Then said the King, Sirs, We have beine advysit of this thing; Sen ?our desyre is my advyse to have, ?e sall it heir anone, sa God me save: Of them without, me thocht the Constabill The louing haill me thocht was most abill; Of them within, it is ane mater plaine, Clariodus, of knightheid soverane, Hes all the laude, quhilk knowis everie wicht, As flour of armis and chevalrie full richt. They answeirit, Sir, as ?e have said, suithlie So it is jugit amongs us veralie. The King gart schaw this [jugement] to the Queine, Wha did gif ane hinger of gold most scheine To them, and bade them as thay list dispone, And gart twa Ladies of hiris with them gone. Unto Meliades have thay passit syne, And hir presentit ane hat of leves greine, Lustie, and said, Madame, ?e knaw ?our awin avow. This Ladie, without aw, Hir hat of gold [scho gave,] and bade that thay Sould it full richtlie it dispone perfey. This lustie hat [all] of greine levis plet, Insteid of it upon hir heid scho set; And with thir Knightis scho sent ladies two. And first unto the Constabill thay go, Saying, The Queine weill gretis ?ow, Sir Knight, And dois present this gudlie hinger bright To ?ow, my Lord, with greatings monie fold; For to hir Grace suithlie it is told, That of the Knightis all that war without, ?ouris beine the praise and louing haill but dout. Then the Lord Constabill full reverentlie Thankit the Queine, and said full humbillie, Thair was full monie Knightis of renowne, To quhom I may be na comparisoun: Bot sen the Queine [out] of hir nobilnes Rewards me so, I with all humbilnes Will it resave, for saike of hir Henes, Whom God preserve in joy and lustines. Two diamonts he gave the Ladies two, And kissit them or he wald pairt them fro. The Heralds he rewairdit with monie, And gave them gold that was [rycht] fair to se. Syne ar thay passit to Clariodus, Him greating [eik] with countinance joyous. Thay him presentit [then] the hat full cleire, And said, Meliades with glaidsum cheire Sent it to him, saying, The Ladies all Him jugit to be most victoriall Of them within, and most of hie renoune Of all the justeris but comparisoune; And told that so him jugit King and Queine, Lordis, Ladies and Knightis all bedeine. Clariodus with wordis richt bening. Joy everlasting, he said, be to the King, And to the Queine, and faire Meliades, And all the Lordis that on sike wayis That gave me name sike as I did not serve; God give me grace thair thankes for to deserve. I dar not tak on me this to resave, Nor for sike cause sike ane rewaird to have; For thair war monie and better knights nor I, Quhilk to resave this gift beine more worthy. Schortlie to tell, no thing might him excuse, Bot to resave thair present he behuise. He gave them thankis oft and courtesly; Syne kissit he the Ladies by and by, And gave ilk ane of them ane chaine of gold; Syne to the awcht ancient Knightis bold He gave awcht coursouris lustie for to se; And to the Heralds in grit quantitie He gave of gold and silver full largelie, And two gounis of cloath of gold mightie. Thay cryit Larges! [Larges!] hÃ© on height Of Sir Clariodus the gentill Knight. Then begouth minstrellis lustilie to play, And lustie wichts the dance begouth to say. The King commandit Clariodus to take Meliades, ane bease dance to make, And bad the Constabill go leade the Queine, And he him self did lead ane madine scheine. And quhen Clariodus had be the hand Meliades, he soune did understande That scho at him displeasit was alyte; Whairfor his heart beine full of wo and syte, And wox so sadlie that mynd he hade of nocht, Bot how into hir favour cum he mocht. When thay had dansit so ane litill space, They sufferit utheris to go into the beace Whill thay reposit beine. And suith to tell, Clariodus abake went be him sell Behinde the dansers, and in ane windo sate; Grite was the dollour that his heart was at, He durst not speir at hir quhairfor or quhy That scho was wroth, love so victoriouslie Him vinquist in his breist; and at the last, Quhan that ane stound or twa had him owerpast, He tuike him hardiment, and thus said he, Madame, I thanke ?ow, so mot God me se, Of the gudlie present ?e to me send, The quhilke I sall unto my lyves end Remember with my service at my might. With soft speech then answeirit scho hir Knight, Clariodus, no thankis gif me to, Sen that I was avowit so to doe. Be hir wordis hir grivance weill he knew, Whilk did his woe quadruple [now] of new. Madame, said he, to me dissimull nocht, If that at me displeasit ?e be ocht; Weill knew I be ?our wordis in this place, That sum pairt now I stand out of ?our grace. Quoth scho, Bot at myself I am displesit. Clariodus in heart the worse was easit, And said, Madame, if that it war ?our will, ?our displeasour I wald ?e schew me till; And if that ?e not please for to do so, Into sum strange cuntrie [then] will I go; I will not heire remaine and ?ow displeise, To do ?ow grevance and myself uneise; [And] best it war me think, for to doe so, Nor ?ow displeise and [alse] my selfin slo; One skaith is les nor two ?e may beleive, My paine I reput not unto ?our greive. Bot quhen scho hard tell of his depairting, Hir heart wox cold, and furth ane sigh did bring. Full red scho was that he sould pas hir fro, For weill scho trowit that it sould have beine so Bot gif he gat hir peace; quhairfore, quoth scho, Clariodus, sen that it man be so, That ?e will wit now quhat I have in mynde, No thing I meane bot that ?e ar unkynde. Fair Sir, or now [oft] I have seine the day, [That, having come, thocht ?e war far away,] ?e wald me bid ?our cullour chose and waill, Seing in tornament it might prevaill, And comforte ?ow my livary for to weire; And now I se sike uses ?e forbeire. At this justing ?e list not to disdaine, Unto my sight and presence to atteine, Nor let me wit if ?e wald just or nocht; The quhy I have considderit in my thocht; Heir beine Ladies [that ar] fairer nor I, ?ow to direct in way of chevalrie, Whom with ever ?e [now] advysit be, Sumtyme ?e war advysit bot with me. And quhan scho had said all, Clariodus Upon his kneis sate doun all dolorus, To schaw hir his intent in humbill wayis; And scho anone hes maid him for to ryse, And stand besyde hir as he did before. Quoth he, My Lady, to quhom I ever more Have beine ane trewthfull servitor and man, Sen first to love or serve ?ow I begane, Trest weill in me thair is no variance; Never could I deale with dissimulance; I liet never in earnest to na wicht, Than unto ?ow, my heart and Ladie bricht, Why sould I do so cursit ane treasoun? Fy on sike fein?it false perditioun! ?it schope I never no wicht for to deceave, Sike longis to ane harlot or ane knaive, And to no wicht that lovis his honoure; For so mot God gif to my saule succoure, As ever I lovit uther Ladie ?it Bot only ?ow, sen first I did promit To be ?our servant and ?our [ain] trew Knight, The quhilk I salbe ever efter my might But slight or ony dissimulatioun, As God alse trewlie be my salvatioun: And in so far as I nocht to ?ow schew, That I this tyme to justing wald persew, Trest not that I of male ingyne it wrocht, Quhilke enterit never nor sall into my thocht, And never ?eilds; ?it I ?ow mercie cry, Now of sleuth and ignorance that I So me misgydit in my raklesnes, Forgive me, Ladie, for ?our gentilnes, And of ?our rewth and womanlie pitie, That ?e no longer have no hait at me In this mater; and thoght my wite was dull, It salbe efter amendit at the full. With that he sate upon his kneis adoune, Asking hir mercie [pitie] and pardoune. Scho is content quhen [he] hir mercie cryit; And eike scho be his countinance espyit That he displeasit was and wo begone, And uther thing save trewth he meinit none. Then was hir breist asswagit of all thing; Bot scho hir heart sa fare had donne resing Unto hir Knight, that [it] atoure measoure Maid at hir heart of jelosie ane schoure, Whairof the straikeand unsufferabill [stound] The breist assaillis quhair love dois so abound. In heart then was scho glaid and rycht joyous, And said, My only Knight, Clariodus, Sen it is so, I heir forgeive ?ow sall, And af his knie thair raisit him at all. And this was donne and that so privily, That naine of them persavit standing by; For with two loveris, being of ane consent, Full secreitlie monie ane gait is went. Then turnit he againe unto the dance, And tuike be hand this Ladie of plesance. And with [new] curage dansit then thir two, As thay that war relaxit out of wo; That then before with painis war oprest, And now againe with joyis new possest; Upon so fair and gudlie wayis they dance. Then said the King, he never saw in France So plesant danseris, and more for to commend. And quhen thair dansing all was at ane end, Clariodus said to Meliades, Madam, I gart grath on [maist] gudlie wayis Twentie fair robis all of satine quhyte, And wrocht all with orphand arte of delyte, To give unto the Kingis Knights and ?ouris, That freschest beine all furrit with amouris; And if ?e think the tyme war oportune, I wold gar fetch them or the danse war donne, And distribute them efter ?our plesance. Scho answeirit him with gudlie countinance, Rycht honorabill is ?our devyse perfey, I wald glaidlie have ane of ?our aray Intill ane hat of cullour quhyte as floure. Glaidlie, Madame, he said, with grit honoure. Unto the Constabill eik he this told, Saying, My Lord, I pray ?ow that ?e wold Helpe me to distribute my livaray, And to beseike the fellowschipe that thay Wald not disdaine sike gifts for to resave, Thocht they be symple to sike lyke men to have. Quoth he, My brother, Sir Clariodus, Sen ?e dispone to gif ane livaray thus, Me of ?our livaray quhy will ?e refuse, Sen I ?ow love as other Knightis dois. With that he lewch on him full joyouslie, For he him lovit ay full tenderlie. I please weill, said Clariodus, that ?e Formist of all into my livaray be, Seing that ?e desyre it. Then ar thay gone Unto the Constabillis chalmer, and thar anone Devysit they on this thing. Then Clariodus Sent for the robis that war pretious. To Bonvaleir he gave command anone, That he sould to the merchandis buithes gone, And bade that he sould by ane hat alse quhyte As is the Mayis blossome of delyte; And syne it geive to Romaryn in keiping, And bad hir with it to hir Ladie ging. Then to the Constabill said Clariodus, Sen that ?e beine so gentill and gratious To be ane of our suite, chose ?e anone Into this lovarray quha sall with ?ow gone. Then ten Knightis chosit the Constabill Out of the Court of France, [the] most abill; Clariodus ten Knightis aveinand, The pik of Ingland and of Estur land; Thair naimis heir neids not for to reporte, The gudliest thay war of all the sorte. When that the Knightis war rewardit thus, Glaidlie thay thankit Sir Clariodus. Thir valiant Lordis vestit all in quhyte, Them to behold it was [ane] grite delyte. The Constabill tuike ane torch bricht birnand, Clariodus ane uther in his hand, And all the leave hes torches taine also, And swa went furth thir Knightis two and two, With hand in hand, all cled into ane suite, Befor them ?eid ane harpe and eike ane lute. Thay fand the King in joy and grite plesance, With Ladies enterit in ane carroll dance, Meliades full fresche leiding the ringe, With ane cleire torche, into hir hand, [birning,] With hir whyte hat on heid of rose culloure, And scho als fresch as is the lillie floure. Thair was the Queine into the danse also, And monie uther lustie ladies mo, And dansing, that to se it was delyte. The Knightis entering so in culloure quhyte The King beheld, and had ane grit pleasance To se the gudlie gyse and countinance. Unto the Constabill and Clariodus He said, Fair Siris, fresch and amorus, ?e have conseillit fra me this noveltie, ?e beine all lustie dansers as thinkis me: Bot [weill] he knew that Sir Clariodus Thir quhyte livoras hes ordanit thus, Becaus that he the Quhyte Knight was before, Him praising in his mynde ay more and more: And all the maner eike persavit he, How to Meliades of grite bewtie He sould be waddit; bot he was wyse at all, And rewlit him as sould ane Prince royall. So in the midis of the jolisie, Thrie Counts are cumit that ar of grite degrie, And in the Palice enterit ar anone; The Counte of Deckare of the thre was one, The Counte of Distempis and the Counte of Champan?ie, Unto the hall ascendit ar all thrie. They helsit have the King on gudlie wayis, And eik the Queine and fair Meliades, The Counte and eik the Countes of Estur. The King, that was ane Prince of grite nurture, Hes them resavit on ane gudlie fassoune, And weill them chereist efter thair renoune. Thair purpose was to beine at the justing, Bot it all endit was or thair cuming. The danse indurit long, and the disporte, The circumstance war long for to reporte. When day approachit neir, to beddis they went, Both King and Queine, Lordis and Ladies jent. Meliades hes taine her leave to gone, The thrie Countis convoyit hir anone Unto hir chalmer; syne tuike leave hir fro, And unto thair rest they all thrie can go. Thus all to beddis went, and sleipit still, Whill bricht Apollo schynit ouer holte and hill. Right as the mirrie larke into the sky Ascendit with ane joyous harmonie, When mistie vapours rysis from the vaile, And leavis hinging full of silver haill, And small foullis delytis them to sing Among the tender rosie blumis ?eing, Of fresch Titane all againis the sighte, From langour them comforting with [the] licht, This lustie Prince no longer might he sleipe, Fra he unto the mirrie day tuike keipe, Bot thocht he wold in hunting for to ryde, And callit on ane varlote him besyde, And bade him gar his maisteris of household, To Boyce de Wincente, that lustie hold, Go and provide with everie ordinance Pertaining to his kinglie governance. This being donne, up raise baith King and Queine, With all his royall Courte richt weil beseine, And service harde with gude devotioune, And syne of menstrallie with merrie sounde. Disjunit they baith lord and ladie bright, And to thair horse anone they can them dicht. With this unto the fair Meliades Bonvalier com to hir on humbill wayis, Saying, My Lord Clariodus me send To ?ow, Madame, and doing recommend, Quhilke hes ?ow send ane diamond full bright, Remembering that he is ?our trewthfull Knight; And he also hes send to ?ow ane sang, The quhilke he maid rycht as the morrow sprang; He and his servandis ar cled in levoray blew, In tokine that he salbe ever trew; If ?e the cullour pleise, he bade me speire. I pleise it weill, quoch scho, in all maneire. Scho tuike the song and diamonde also, And threw ane goldin ring hir finger fro, And said, Anone present this to my Knight, And thanke him of his gyftis all at ryght. Bonvaleir went and did as scho him bad. With this the lustie Courte, with hartis glaid, Muntit on horse with weiddes fresch and gay. Meliades, in nobill and rich aray, In bewtie blumit as blossome on the ryce, Triumphant as terrestrial paradice. To tell ?ow of hir fresch abuil?ement, Or of hir palfrayis pretious ornament, It war prolix, thairfor I let it go. This nobill Courte and Prince furth ryding so, Up to the hevin gois the trumpits sound, Up gois the curious sound of clarioun, With hornis blast they cheir the hardie houndis, Whill Parice wallis reardit with the soundis. So furth thay raid at the ports of the toune, On fra the royall Palice of grite renoune. Clariodus cled in ane mantill blew, With his four fellowis alse in the ilke hew, Full rich furrit with mertrix that is fyne, Upon ane cursour, with heart leoneine, The quhilk Madame Meliades him gave, Softlie he raid quhill he owertuike the leave. Him followit varlots awcht in blew all clede, On wantoun cursouris fate and full weill fede, With silver chan?eis about thair halse full bright. Aucht gentill men, that lustie war and wight, He hade also all cled in dameis blew, With golden chan?eis that war bright of hew. Into the Courte he raid. His lustie entrie It was ane sight full gudlie for to se. The King him callit, [and,] but mair abaide, Clariodus, tell me, anone he said, The maner of the tornament in Spaine; [And] quha did best to me do ?e not faine. Weill wist the King the haill renoune hade he, At the ilk justing was so fair to se. Ane litill reid than wox Clariodus, And to the King he hes maid answeire thus: Sir, if that I the treuth sall ?ow declaire, Full monie mightie and nobill knight was thaire, That so weill provit, that harde was for to tell Whilk of the sorte in chevalrie did excell, Althoght the ladies, of thair courtessie, To sike ane honour did me magnifie, As for to gif the laude and praise to me; ?it I deservit it in no degrie, For monie ane Knight thair better was nor I. Then said the King, I traist rycht veralie, That men full far might seike, or that they fand Ane Knight that ware of deidis sa valiand, To wine renoune in armis ?ow before. Of other diverse materis spake they more. The King so gentill was in commoning, [That] thair was none of honoure, old nor ?ing, Of all the Knightis of Meliades, Bot he with them at leasoure did advyse. And quhen this royall Courte of nobilnes War cumit to Boyce de Vinsentes, From horse all doune [thay quicklie] did descend, And in the mightie Palace as they wende The Ladies all ar unto chalmer gone, The nobill King to hall is went anone. The wallis ware arayit full lustillie, With rich arace [that] thar war full mightie; The hall was mikill and [eik] full of licht. And quhen the denner was all redie dicht, The King sent to [the] chalmer for the Queine, And for Meliades the lustie ladie scheine; They com anone at his commandiment, Himself begane the buirde incontinent, And set abone him all the ladies faire, For he no stait wald let be keipit thaire. The ladies at his tabill grit and small, He gart be sete, thoght they refuisit all. The Count of Estur, and the Lord Constabill, Clariodus with uther lordis abill, Palexis and his brother Amandur, With thair two fellowis of grit honoure, Sir Pennent de la Carier full famous, Sir Charles, Sir Broun, and eike Sir Donaus, And all that longit to Meliades, He hes gart [thame] be set in gudlie wayis At his awin tabill, thocht thay refuisit thairto, His bidding ?it behuifit thay all to doe. He thair hes maid him fellow and no king, As myne awthour hes maid [trew] rehearsing. He was both manlie, wyse and gratious, He could be mirrie and solatious Whair that him list, for till make companie. The coursis com right fair and royallie. The King wold not sit long in that degrie, So longit he the royall chase to se Of fellow deire within his perke royall. Then suddantlie up rysis ane and all. The King twike be the hand Meliades Before them all, and said on this wayis, Faire Siris, ?e sall know, that it is so That none [this day] sould into widdis go Without ane lady, and thairfor that I Of brightest bewtie chose me ane lady. They leuch all at the King that raillit so. Be this was said, anone to horse they go. The nobill King ascendit on his steid, And him behinde the floure of womanheid; Syne hes commandit Sir Clariodus To take the Queine gudlie and gratious Behinde him on his horse: and but demand Thair hes he fulfillit the Kings command. The Count Samphan?e with [alse] bissie cure Twike behind him the Countes of Esture. The Earle of Esture twike behind him eike The Ladie De la Carier fair and meike. So everie lustie Lord and gentill Knight Hes horsit ane Ladie of beawtie bright. Out of the royall Palice have they past With plesant sound of [hunting] hornis blast, And to the wodis raid full royallie, Whair thay hade hunting right aboundantlie. It was ane nobill sight for to behold The fair fresch forrest and the florischit fold, The saitis set with hunters of knowledge, The eger hounds desyrous of courage. Furth gois the dogis throw the ryse on raw, The deir doun cumis dunting throw the schaw. With How and Cry they follow them behinde. The hunteris lurkis law under the lynde. The heard in cumis. Fearslie but abaid The hundis in thair leasches dois abraid, Thair heartis dunting in breistis for desyre. Thus seing, the bukis go bak then in the swyre Be two and thrie, endlong the water syd. The hunds fra monie ane leasch dois out glyde, That under the bewis beine lousit monie brace. The hunters glaidlie followis on the chase. Lo! heir the hynde is letherit be the hunde, And thair ane heart gois gronand to the grunde. So this day fair quhat is thair maire to saine Whill thay of deiris ane grit number had slaine. Clariodus, that raid befor the Queine, Had in his hand ane dearte both scharpe and keine, That he was usit ay weill for to cast; So com ane [deir] buke by him at the last Into his way [and] halfling him againe. Madam, quoth he, pleis ?e for to have slaine ?one faire deir buke that cumis in our way? I ?ow requyer, the Quene can to him say. He did his coursour with his spurris broch Whill neir the buke swiftlie did he aproach, And with sike force the darte did in him dryve, Befor the Queine, that he fell deid belyve. Lordis and Ladies that this thing hes seine, Gritlie it praisit, and most of all the Queine Hes him commendit into mikill thing. Ane Knight hes it rehersit to the King, Quhilke rydand was before Meliades. I know, quoth he, that mekill beine to praise The deidis all of Sir Clariodus, Whilke is both strong, hardie and chevalrus. This being said, the King schuipe him to ryde; Clariodus he gart ryde him besyde, And bade him sing. He said, he wald anone, For he of dissobedience maide none. Then said he to Meliades, Madame, Sing ?e âSi je suis tous jours a Madameâ? Scho said, Forsuith that song I can not sing. Clariodus, let heir it, said the King. On of his servitours he callit thane, The quhilke ane tennour pleasantlie begane, And he the truble sang rycht curiouslie, That it resoundit ane dulse melodie. The King grite plesance had it for to heire, So had the Queine and all the ladies cleire. When he had sung, the King said, Verament This is ane lustie song, and right plesant; This is ane ballet fresch and amorus, Is it new maid? ?ea, said Clariodus. Meliades then smyllit, changing hew, When that he speirit if it was maid of new; For the ilk song it was that he hir send That day of morrow with ane recommend, The quhilk Bonvaleir did to her present. The King in musike was intelligent, He sang ane tennor to Meliades, And scho the trubill sang on gudlie wayis. The thrie Earlis that cumit ware of laite Did sing also with voices dulcorate. In cumpanies ouer all the courte they song, Grite mirrines and joy was them among. Thus pat thay off the tyme with faire pastance, With mirthful breistis bathit in plesance, While that they enterit at Parice portis bricht; And throw the ryndis raid with heartis licht, As thay that to the royall Palice tendit, Whill fra thair horse alsweith they have descendit, And enterit all in thair chalmers anone, Whill tyme was unto supper for to gone. The King, that ever in honour did excell, Them feistit faire, the trewth if I sould tell, Ane monethes space, with sike triumphe and cheir. That none on lyfe under the sune so cleire More plesance hade, nor levit in more joy, Nether in land of Greise, nor ?it in Troy. And quhen the moneth aprochit neir to ende, The Ladie purposit then hame to wende, And garte hir folke make readie in all thing, Againe the day of hir depairting. So happinit in the meine tyme to be, Ane herald cumit out of Ingland cuntrie Thair from the King unto Meliades, And in hir chalmer as scho did up ryse He enterit, and hir salust courteslie, Saying, The King ?our Father rycht heartilie Commendis him to ?ow, and eike the Queine, The quhilkis for ?ow grite langoure dois susteine. Thay have me chargit hame ?ow for to speid; For thair is cuming withoutin ony dreide Thrie faire ambassants from thrie sundrie Kings For ?our wadding. Outower all uther things Thay ?ow desyre; but neverthelese the King, Into that mater worke will he nothing Whill ?our hame cuming, and quhill that he have [Advice] of Earle Estur; sa God me save, Without his counsall he will doe nothing. And quhen this Ladie hard of the tyding, Sum thing scho was into her heart adreid, Believing to sum King thay sould hir wade; Whilke rather wald be deid, without fein?eing, Nor of the world to have the grittest King And leive Clariodus hir onlie Knight. Fair countinance scho maid ?it at [hir] micht, Saying, My frind, welcum ?e ar to me; Thankit be God, of the prosperitie Both of my Father, and of my Mother eik; To save them two, Lord Jesus I beseike. Me for to wade quhen ever that they will, I salbe reddie thair counsall to fulfill. Within thrie dayis we sall out of France Depart, God willing, but more circumstance. When this was said, to Earle Estur he went, And in this mater schew all his intent, And all this thing to him maid manifest; Syne went unto ane Ostlarie to rest. The mariage of [the] faire Meliades Into the Court hes spred on sike ane wayis, Whill it come to Clariodus audience, Whilke throw his breist withoutin resistance As grundine dairte then awfullie did glyde. With sade thochtis his mynd was occupyed. He was dispairit and right sore adrede, Evin that the King her Father sould hir wade Upon ane of those Princes right potent; Beseikeing God full oft in his intent, On sike ane wayis that it sould not proceid. This Ladie eike, that leives in sike ane dreid, Ever to God scho prayis devotlie To send hir him quhome that so [richt] trewlie Scho lovit ay, and sould quhill scho might lest. Thus, nather of thair heartis beine at rest, To speike with uther desyring so gritly At lasoure, quhair no wight might [thame] espy. Clariodus anone went to the King, Whilke then with his thre Counts wes advysing. The King then drew aparte fra them anone, And with Clariodus at lasoure spake allone Of diverse things; and so amongs the lave He said, Clariodus, sa mote God me save, I wald have ?ow still in my Courte dwelling, Whilk my desyre is ower all uther thing. I heir now that Our Brother of Ingland Hes for his Doughter sent, [and] desyrand To have hir waddit at hir hame cuming. Clariodus, ?e doe for me this thing, The quhilke anone I sall unto ?ow say, Be fresch and lustie on hir wadding day; With that he smylit on him lustillie. Clariodus weill understude the why, Whairfore, he said, and this he [smyling] spake, Sir, ?our command to fill I undertake; For that ilk day full blyth I think to be Of everie knight in that ilke assemblie. Then said the King, God grant that it be so, That ware my desyre, and salbe ever mo. The King he thankit in all humbill thing. Then to the Queinis chalmer went the King, And thair he fande the faire Meliades, To quhome sweitlie he said on this wayis, Madam Meliades, as I suppose, Of lustie princes ?e [sall] have ?our chose; Be not haistie, bot weill advysit be, And chuse ane valiant man in all degrie Of might; for landis ?e neid nocht to crave, Seing ane mightie kingdome that ?e have. Sir, ?e know, scho answeirit, in all thing I mone obey unto my Father the King. Thus raillit he with hir full pleasantlie, And scho him answeir maid debonarlie. When cumin was anone the latter day Of this moneth, withoutine mair delay Meliades unto the King is went, Saying unto him with full meike intent, Sir, I am readie to pase in my cuntrie, Gif thair be nocht ellis ?e wald with me. Madame, quoth he, gif so be that ?e will, Now hamewarte pase, God ?our purpose fulfill, And ?ow conserve in plesance and in joy, I will my self in gaitwarte ?ow convoy. Thoght scho said nay, and laith was thairunto, Was none excuse, bot [that] he wold it doe. Then said scho to the Queine, in humbill wayis, I thanke ?ow heire, Madame, ane thowsand sayis, Of the grite jentrice ?e have schawin to me, Of ?our hie honoure [and] nobilitie; My Father hes me send sex faire coursouris, And sex haiknayis plesant attoure measouris; ?e sall have sex of them, and I ?ow pray Them to resave; and tho the Queine alway Excusit hir, ?it scho maid sike instance, The Queine garte take of them delyverance. Thair sadillis war of cloth of gold full bright, Browderit with stonis radious and light, And they alse quhyte as onie snowis doune. The nobill Queine, that was of grite renoune, Hir thankit sweitlie, and gave to her also Ane chaine of gold; and syne with heartis wo, They kissit utheris with teiris distelling. Scho tuike hir leave at Ladies auld and ?ing. Syne come the gudlie Countes of Esture, And tuike hir leave with countinance demure Both at the Queine and at the Ladies all, And at the Kingis Court universall. Unto them all grite giftis gave the Queine. Meliades to close discendit beine. Syne at the Queine [his] leave tuik Earle Estur, And at hir Ladies plesant of portratour. And last of all, Clariodus the Knight Inclynit to the Queine, and bad gude nicht, To hir ay recommending his service. And scho againe upon full humbill wayis Said unto him, Ha! Sir Clariodus, Faire weill, in world the Knight most gratious, And most of deidis famous and of pryse; I am weill holdine unto ?ow oft syse, The richest jewell to the worldis end, ?e, the most nobill Knight, unto me send. With that scho tuike thair of [the] bright gold cleire Ane verie lustie firmaleit most deire, And said, Clariodus, ?e sall this take, And weire it in ?our cuntrie for my saike. He thankit hir full courteslie at all; And then scho hes him kissit anone withall. He tuike his leave at everie Ladie faire. The King was mountit on ane palfray thaire, Ane of the sex the quhilke Meliades Gave to the Queine, quhilke mikill beine to praise; He said thay war ane gyst most honorabill, And thankit hir with wordis amiabill; He said he wold with hir on gaitwart ryde. Not one of them no longer wald abyde; Thay raid out throw the toune full royallie, With trumpit sound of hevenlie melodie. And quhen they war two mylls without the toune, The nobill King, most worthie of renoune, Tuike leave at hir, and gave hir ane colleir, With curious worke that pretious was and deire; And said to hir, Madame Meliades, I me commend to ?ow on humbill wayis, Beseiking ?ow, the pearle of plesance, That ?e wold have on ws rememberance; ?e spair ws not, for we all tyme ar ?ouris. This lustie Princes, with changing collouris, Inclyning then, and reverencing the King, Thay kissit thair, and [so] maid depairting: Syne kissit he hir Ladies ane and ane. The Count of Esture thair his leave hes taine, And his Countes; and syne Clariodus, To whom the King, with wordis gratious, Said, Faire cousing, in heart I am full wo So suddantlie that ?e depairte me fro; Thair leivis none in all this world so wyde, That is so welcum with was to abyde. This Knyght inclynit law with reverence, And humblie thankit the Kingis excellence; Saying, ?our Hienes I thanke humbillie, That hes me treitit heir so nobillie; My service salbe ?ouris for evermore, Whilke celsitude conserve the King of glore. With that he tuike his leave with courtes faire Both at the King and at the Lordis thaire, And eik for?et he not the Constabill. Thir Knightis two with wordis amiabill Tuike leave at uther, imbracing tenderlie, As thay that lovit uthers ay parfytlie. Depairtit so thir Lordis of renoune, Eik my Lord sayis in his translatioun, That from the King none unrewairdit went, Of all the Court nobill and excellent, For unto them with grite humanitie, He schew his regale liberalitie; The quhilk againe to Parice did returne, And thay raid furth withoutin more sojorne. This Princes and hir lustie companie Unto thair cuntrie sped so bissilie, That to the sea they approachit belyve, They schipit all and syne did [saif] aryve In Ingland, whair on horse thay have ascendit, As thay that north into the cuntrie tendit. Thus in thair voyage all was fair and well, Whill, throw ane forrest as thay did travell, They saw ane pail?eoun lustillie upstent, Of silke all reide, that schew full redolent. The Earle said to Meliades the bright, Behold, Madame, besyde ?ow stent on height, The fairest pail?eoun that ever I saw with ey, What is within I reid we go and see. Within the pail?eoun luikit thay anone, And saw ane Knight thair ly with monie grone Above ane bed that lustie was to seine, Full richlie coverit all with satine greine; Ane arrow stake into his schoulder deipe; Besyde him sate ane Ladie doing weipe So wofullie, that pitie was to see. Meliades abaisit than was sche, And bade the Earle within the pail?eoun go, And speir the cause quhairfore that he lay so, And quhy scho was so wobegone ane wight. The Earle enterit and helsit hes the Knight. With febill voice he helsit him againe, Lyke as he hade felt unsufferabill paine. And then unto the damosell he said, If that ?e pleise, [my] faire and lustie Maide, I wald ?e did the cause to me declaire, Whairfor ?e weipe so pitiouslie and saire. Then spake the Ladie, Sene that ?e requyre, I sall ?ow schaw, this is my brother deir; We beine discendit of ane hous royall, For of our blude we stand imperiall In our cuntrie callit Northumberland; And he that was ane Knight full valiand Raid seikand adventuris in ane forrest dicht And met foure Knightis that was fearse and wicht, Whilke semblit on him hes so cruellie, And he defendit him right nobillie, That of the foure thrie [had] he broght af lyfe, The fourt then fled and let ane arrow dryve, Whilke hurte him in the schoulder as ?e se, The quhilk was lansit with sike destanie, That of the world the jentillist Knight but doubt Mone with his hande this arrow now draw out, Or than, alleace! he leivis never more. The nobill Earle saw hir weipe so sore, Ladie, he said, comfort ?ow and be still, Peradventure God hes send helpe ?ow till. The Earle went to Meliades againe, And hir declairit the haill mater plaine All worde be worde richt as the Ladie schew, Saying, Will [now] ?our Knightis all persew Whilk will the arrow draw out of the Knight? Thairof, I pray ?ow, said this gudlie wight. Sir Amandour then [first] the Earle did call, And unto him the cace declairit all, And prayit him to go and to assay For to draw out the arrow gif he may. Sir Amandour this answeir maid him to, It noth effeiris sike things for to doe, And Sir Clariodus in the companie: Bot him the Earle treitit so nobillie, That he is went the mater to assay, Richt modestlie withoutin grite delay, And pullit at the arrow with his hand; Bot thair alsweith impediment he fand, For him it wald not steire out of the wounde; The Knight full sorelie schrinkit at the stound. Sir Amandur was in his heart full woe, And furth out of the pail?eoun can he go. With wordis wrath his Eame he could reprove, That sike ane mater unto him did move. Palexis past thairefter to assay; Bot he might noth the arrow draw away. The ?oung Knightis [then] preisit all aboute; Bot for them all no way it wald come out. Than meiklie said Meliades, I pray That ?e will cause Clariodus assay. That war, quoth he, ane grite presumtioun, Efter so monie Knightis of renowne, That I sould go assay quhair they have fail?eit. Bot his excuse [in] nothing him availlit; Scho him commandit for his Ladies saike, The quhilke scharplie unto his hearte did stryke. Then lichtit he and in the pail?eoun went, The Knight he helsit and the Ladie jent, Saying, Faire Sir, cumin I am to sie Gif I may helpe ?ow of ?our necessitie. Neir him he went with full grite humbillnes, Haveing in God all houpe and confidence, To helpe the Knight; of him he hade pitie, And softlie at the arrow pullit he. It com to him but preise or vehemence, Without obstakill or onie resistence. The bluide with that sprang out aboundantlie Out of the wound, and bled continuallie; Bot nevertheles the Knight on fute up start, And thankit him full oft with all his heart Imbracing him, saying, Of Knightheid floure, All haill! the Eard awcht ?ow [for] to honoure. I thanke our gratious God ane thousand sayis, That hes ?ow sent to me upon this wayis To be my helpe, the quhilk nane uther might; For it assayit hes full monie ane Knight, Bot none of them micht it remeid bot ?e, That is of Knightheid floure and A per se. What is ?our name, if that it war ?our will? And he anone answeirit hes him till, Clariodus of Estur they me call, ?one was my Father visite ?ow first of all. This Knight and eike the Madine humbill and wyse Unto the Earle and to Meliades Ar passit, and them thankit reverentlie, And so did thay to all the cumpanie, Onlie for saike of Sir Clariodus. Syne to the pail?eoun mirrie and joyous They went, quhair that Clariodus thay fand, To stanche his [wounde] quhilk ?it was abydand. The wounde out ran with grite effusioun, Alsweith he tuike the ring of the Lyoune, And twichit it and stemmit it anone. Clariodus then to his horse is gone. He tuike his leave, and efter them he raide, Whilke them among grite avanceing hes maid Of him and of his hie renoune and prise, And how he gentill was at all devyse. This woundit Knight relievit of his woe, Commandit than sex knightis for to go And make his litter of gudlie fassioune; And syne thairin hes [he] garte lay him doune, To have him to his friendis hastillie, This Ladie [also] ryding neir him by, With all hir madinis [full] faire in feire: Thus hame he went, rycht gladsome of his cheire. Sir Brounar de la Haunt it was his name, Ane Lord he was of grite renowne and fame, Quhilk to Clariodus was efterwarte, Ane servitoure richt faithfull in [his] heart. Clariodus hes sped him haistillie, And soune he hes owertaine the companie, And long with them raide speiking to and fro; And syne unto Meliades can go, And spake of diverse materis by the way, And of the woundit Knight eike speak did thay; He tauld how he him stanchit of bleiding. To hir he said among all uther thing, Madame, ?e sould be blyth and have courage That rydis hame now to ?our mariage; Fair Princes bydis [for] ?our hame cuming. Scho answeirit him with wordis richt bening, Saying, Monie askis the thing thay not get; To love and serve quho may loveris let? Quoth he, Madame, full suith it is ?e say, Bot ?it me thinke that gude it war alway That ?e providit war of mariage, Considering that the King is of grite age, And hes no bairnis bot your self allone. And that is suith, quoth scho, so mote I gone; Thairfor ane thing at ?ow I will require, Whilke of ?one Princes war it ?our desyre That I sould marie, dissimull not at all. Quoth he, Madame, my wite it is bot small [Thus] the estaite of Princes for to judge; Becaus as ?it to ?outh I beine ane sudge, And can not on so grite maters decerne, For my ?oung counsall wyse men will disperne. And than, quoth scho, to this answeir ?e can, Into this warld of everie leving man, Whom wald ?e tytest hade me to his wyfe? Quoth he, Grite Lordis wyser be sike fyve The King your Father hes to his counsell, Whairfor in vaine it war for me to tell, For, as thay say, is abiller for to be; Whairfor, Madame, ?e scorne to speir at me. Then said the Ladie, ?e fast your selfe excuse, Of ?our counsall say on for ?our behuise; For thocht ?e know not quhat the lordis ment, ?e know thairof quhat is ?our awin intent, Whom with ?e wold [that] I sould maried beine; Know ?e not eik the trew love us betweine? Now go I alse neir ?ow as [that] I may, To gar ?ow sumthing in this mater say; And I remember that sike thing hes beine, Quhen thair was nothing spokine us betweine, Bot ?e wald answeir, and not be dangerous. I cry ?ow mercie, said Clariodus, My mynde thairin rycht as my self ?e knaw, Whairfore thair was no neid to ?ow to schaw; ?e can not weill considder as I deime; And sen ?e will the suith that I expreime, Gif it sould be as I wald wisch, I say I wald no wight in world ?ow had bot I, And thocht I speike sik words, ?e not disdaine, For grite desyre dois [ever] me constraine. To speik thir wordis, then said Meliades, My Knight, I thanke ?ow on most humbill wayis, That ?e wold do me sike worschipe and honoure As me to wade, and ?e of knightheid floure. Full weill I waite, had ?e not lovit me, ?e wald not ask with me to mariet be; Bot I sa far beholdine ame trewlie Unto ?our Father the Count [maist] worthie, And alse unto ?our Mother the Countes, And to ?our selfe in love and worthines, I ?ow promit I sall no husband have, Bot quhom ?e wald I hade, sa God me save. I height to keipe ?ow this promissioune, As I am Kingis dochter of renoune; Or I it breke ather for weill or wo, I sall dreidles out of the countrie go, As I have done before tyme for ?our saike; And thairfor no displeisoure in hearte ?e take, Whatever ?e heir or se, ?e hold ?ow still: In signe that I this promeis sall fulfill, Ane ring of gold I gif ?ow heir, my Knight, And for my saike ?our heart ?e hold on height. Clariodus the gold ring did resave, And courteslie he oft thanks to her gave, Saying, Madame, nixt God I awght to serve And love ?our Ladischipe quhill that I sterve, That hes me gevin sik consolatioun, Quhilke falling was in disperatioun. For gif I sall the trewth to ?ow declaire, My heart was full of dreid and [of] dispaire, Ay sen I tyding hard of ?our wadding; Whair I hade will to sigh, now may I sing; And quhair I trowit langour sould me slo, ?e have delyverit me of all that wo. Of this mater as then thay spake no more; He let hir ryde ane litill him before, That schoe might talke with uther companie; And he began to sing all secreitlie, For the grite joy was at his heart perfay. This lustie courte thay raide furth [all] the way, Whill thay com neire to Londoun the citie. Thair monie ane Lord that was of grite degrie Them met triumphantlie without the toune, Baith Bischops, Duiks, and Earlis of renoune, And hir convoyit throw the rewis faire, With silke and arras that arrayit war. The bellis range in kirkis up and doune, The silver trumpits maid ane mirrie sound; Among the pepill haill was this clamoure, Welcum our lustie Princess of honoure! Then at the Palice richt as scho discendit, The nobill Lordis still on hir dependit, And hir convoyit up into the hall; Of hir cuming [richt] glaid was ane and all, And of the cuming of Clariodus: Thus was the Court richt blyth and joyous. The supper was anone [all] redie dicht, And to the tabill with monie Lord and Knight Adoune [then] sate this Princes honorabill, And servit was with meitis delectabill. The night before thair cuming to the toune, Thre famous Bischops of full grite renoune, And thrie grite Earlis that war full worthie, Quhilkis war sex hundereth horse in companie; Ane of them sent was to Clariodus, The uther to Palexis richt famous, The third to Amandour the nobill Knight, And broght with them thrie golden crounis bright, To croune them Kingis of thrie kynriks cleire, As ?e sall efter in this storie heire. Into ane lustie Innis ludgit thay, Whair they on windowis and on stairis lay And saw this Princes and this Courte ryde by, And said they saw never sik ane company; And of thair Oist they speirit of the thrie That sould the Princes of thair realmis be. And he them schew unto [the] Knightis thair, Vail?eand of deidis and of thair bodies faire. Thir Lordis them commendit grittumlie, Saying, That they war nobill and worthie, Of thrie realmis to be crounit Kings, And happilie providit war thair rings To have sike thrie Princes for to be, That both war cumit of ane linage hie, And syne was faire and seimit gratious; And most they praisit Sir Clariodus. This night owerdrave, day cumand was anone, And bright Apollo with his beamis schone Ower land and sea, and all the land abreid; This gudlie Princes, floure of womanheid, Addressit hir in hir freschest aray, As is the freschest blossome into May; And up him dressit everie Lord and Knight; Thir thrie Ambassats freschlie hes them dicht Unto thair Lordis, presents to attaine, Full monie ane gowne of silke and golden chaine Was thame among, and gif [I] tell the treuth, Unto the Palice bounit they all but sleuth. Thir tydings harde hes [Sir] Clariodus; Them to convoy he hes sent Knights famous. When all hade servit God, and syne disjunit, Talbrounis and trumpits syne up tunit; Meliades knights convoyit them the way. Alsweith within the Palace enterit they. Weill orderit, and on ane gudlie wayis, They come before Madame Meliades; They helsit have this Princes of bewtie; Syne everie Lord and Knight in his degrie. When they hade salust other courteslie, Then to Meliades thay said humbillie, Madame, with leive of ?ow we will advyse Heir with the Earle of Estur in sum wayis, And we at lenth sall commoune with ?ow syne; With that thay doe full low to hir inclyne. Doe as ?e pleise, quoth schoe, I am content. Thir Lordis and the Earle togidder went Into ane chalmer be them selves allone. Ane of the bischops speikis thus anone, My Lord, ?e know the Lady ?our Countes Beine sister to the Kingis nobilnes Of Ireland, quhilke [now] febill is and old, And may excerse no justice as he wold, And hes no heares abill unto the croune, That cuming are of his successioune: Whairfor unto ?our Sonne ws sent hes he, To gar him cum and ringe in our countrie; And heir we have brought for his [hie] renoune The regale wande of justice and the croune, To delyver to him, and give possessioun Of all his nobill and mightie regioun; And bade, or we returne, to croune him King, And in his name the realme to him resinge. We understand that this may not be donne Into ane tyme that ware mair opportoune Nor heir befor this royall companie. The Earle maid answeir, and said full courteslie, First God I thanke, from quhilke cumis all grace, And syne the King, that so weill ordanit hes His tender bluide efter himself to ringe. Clariodus he gart unto him bring, And said, My Sonne is heir, the quhilk I geive Unto the King alse long as he may leive. Of Ireland two Lordis that was of mikill fame, Of quhom as now I neid not schaw the name, Ane Bischope and ane Earle, them betweine Hes led him furth, quhilk gudlie is to seine. Full joyfull was the pepell auld and ?eing, Quhen that thay saw him led then as ane King, Betweine two Lordis nobill and potent: Bot thay sum pairt in heartis war dolent, Trowand that into Ireland he sould go, Full loath war thay he sould depairte them fro. Two famous Bischopis and honorabill Earlis two Palexis tuike and Amandour also, And to them said on this [samine] maneire. Becaus thir brether two Uncles war but weire To thir two Princes that grite war of degrie, The King of Garnet and of Castel?ie, They war lede furth upon the samine wayis. Full gudlie was the maner and the gyse Of the triumph was maid at thair crouning. All to the kirke are went thir Lordis dinge. Thir Kingis thrie was sete full royallie In regale seats, coverit mightillie With cloathes of gold, befor the hie altere, And on thair heidis thrie goldin crounis deire, With awfull wand of justice in thair hand, Servet with nobill Lordis inclynande. And Prelats that war dinge and honorabill, Begane the service in wayis conveinabill, And thair ane psalme [full] solemelie they sang, For noyise of organis all the collage rang. When that the royall service all was fynit, The Earlis, Lordis and barrounis all inclynit Befor Clariodus with blyth visage, Randering to him of Ireland the homage; Richt so was donne unto the uther two. And syne unto the Palice can thay go, Whair ane full royall denner ordanit was. The Kingis thrie war lede with nobilnes Out of the kirke, with septour, sword, and croune, With noyse of trumpit and of clarioun; They enterit in the Palice joyfullie, With mirthfull sound of hevinlie menstrellie. Heir to be schorte, and leive all circumstance, Thay go to tabill with joy and all plesance. Betwix two Kingis sate Meliades, Ane King sat hir before on gudlie wayis; Thrie Bischopis, and of Estur the Countes, Sate at the tabill thair with all glaidnes; Two maisters of houshold to King Philippon War merchald at the tabill end anone, With them Earle Estur of nobilnes and fame, And the richt honorabill Bischope of Durhame. I may not tary on thair marchelling, To tell ?ow all the royall triumphing, Thair excellent and thair [maist] plesant cheire, Nor of their gudlie service the maneire, Nor of thair grite disport and minstrellie, Nor of the coursis that did multiplie, Nor among coursis the intermeisis glaid, Nor the delectabill comoning thay hade, Nor of the pretious meitis delicate, Nor of thair syndrie stories prorogate; I let owergo all sik prolixitie. Foure syndrie liquoris ran with royaltie, From foure beistis in foure nuiks of the hall, Whilke was ane sight richt fair and triumphall: Ane was ane lyoun, right awfull and terribill, At quhois gaiping mouth, full horibill, Rane myghtie wyne, right plesant, cleir, and cauld; It was ane gude sight him for to behald: The uther was ane lustie unicorne, Eyne Ipocras did ryn out at his horne: The thride ane tyger was, felloun and stout, Rose water fearcelie at his nose ran out: The fourte ane marmaide was, with traces bright, At both her papis mylke ran out on height. And at the letter course, in come ane gyse Of small chyldreine, [full] gudlie to devyse, To the number of fortie, all transsigurat As wolfes full wyld, and [strangelie] deformate, Quhilk scatterit flouris faire throw the hall, With savoure sweit as ony balme royall; And ever ilk ane on ane instrument, On courious wayis, with fyngeris diligent, Diverslie glaidand, all in ane accorde Raising on lost, with joy and grite consorde, The hearts of all the nobill audience. Of eardlie joy thair was no indigence. What sould I longer tell of thair feasting? Thair cumis ane end of everie worldlie thing. When thay hade feastit long upon this wayis, Both Kingis, Lordis, and Ladies, up thay raise, And went to chalmeris fair at all pleasouris, Thair to delyver the ambassadouris. The Ireland Bischope, and the Earle also, [Hes] thair delyverance askit hame to go. The King Clariodus on faire maneire, Thus saide, My Lordis and [my] friendis deire, I thanke the King my Eame of his [gude] grace, That hes his croune, his septore, and his mace, Donne of his nobilnes to me resinge, Albeit thairto I am no thing condinge; And quhair he wold I to his ringe repairit, It may be with expedience declairit Before ?ow all now at this [same] instante, My companie this Princes may not wante, Whilk to hir Father rydis furth anone, Go I hir fro, scho then is left allone; Bot of this voyage quhen [that] I have donne, And quhen I se the tyme is oportune, Sall none ambassage neide me for to bring Unto my Eame and honorabill King: ?e counsall me thairfor in this mater, And to ?our myndis I sall assent right heir. Then said the Bishope with all reverence, ?our wordis beine, Sir, fructuous of sentence; Nothing we can ?our speache [as now] impunge, So scharpe with reasounis cyllit beine our tonge, ?ow in this present voyage we excuse; Sen on no wayis fro hir [?ow go] behuise, ?e may not leave the realme desolate, Thairfor ane louetenant to us create, Our realme to governe in [richt] regiment, Whill ?e gif us your presence excellent. The King consentit to this petitioun, And gave right thair his [hie] commissioun Unto the Earle of Durhame right famous; And soune anone they war delyverit thus. And finallie thir other Kingis two Thair ambassatis hes delyverit also. Full grite giftis thir Kingis gave all thrie Unto thir Lordis mikill of dignitie, Commending them with hearts unto their Kings, Them thanking oft [syss] into mikill things. They tuike thair leave full fairlie on this wayis, Both at the Kings and at Meliades. Earle Estur them convoyit bissilie, Unto the close quhair they fand all redie Ane Knight ordanit be King Clariodus, With monie ane goldin jewell pretious, Both goldin coupis, chan?eis and rings, Rich cloathes of gold, and monie coastlie things, For to present to the ambassadouris; And syne they did with [verie] grite honouris, Convoy them [all] weill far out of the toune. The Bischope and the Earle of great renoune Of Durhame hes thair leavis taine anone, With the ambassate grathing them to gone; With that their gaitis they did depairt, and than Thair leave at uther hes taine everie man. Earle Esture tuike his leave and hamewart raid. And the Ambassadours, withoutin more abaid, In thair voyage usit sik diligence, Whill thay all come soune into the presence Of thair thrie Kings, and than thay all declairit How thay had donne, and hade [in] nothing spairit. Full glaid they war quhen they hard this tyding Of thair Uncles and of thair honoring. All thrie they feastit the Ambassadouris, That had so plesantlie donne thair pleasouris. To chalmer King Clariodus is gone, And his rob royall hes laid af anone, And eik his crown of gold i-forgit new, And pute on him ane goune of velvote blew; Syne went unto the chalmer of Meliades, To quhome schoe courteslie did [thair] up ryse, And unto him maid kinglie reverence, Saying to him, with smylling countinance, Is this the fassioun of ane King, said sche, So quyetlie to cum in this degrie Into ane chalmer quhair ladies dois abyde? Scho set him on ane cuscheine hir besyde. He said to hir thir wordis secreitlie, Nather King, Earle, nor [?it ane] Duike am I, Nor uther Lord, Madame, in ?our presence, Bot ?our awin Knight to doe ?ow reverence To ?ow abone all uther warldis wight, Alse long as I have ather wite or might. Long spake they thus of materis to and fro. The Earle Estur towardis them can go, And said, that speidfull [now it ]war that we Schoupe ws this night in Belvilladoune to be, Whilk is from ws bot awcht mylis of way. All to this thing anone consentit thay, Thair horse thay gart be grathed suddenly. When everie thing was at poynt and readie, The quhilke perteinit unto thair estaite, At schorte thay maid them readie for the gaite, Kingis, Knightis, and Ladies of renowne, Ascendit on thair horse with trumpit soun. The Lordis of the toune did them convoy, Rycht honorabillie with plesance and with joy, Whill thay war riddine ane great pearte of the way; Syne to the toune againe returnit thay. The lustie Courte them sped on sike maneire, So at Belvell they come to the suppeire. When the King wist his Dochter was so neire, He hes delyverit on ane fair maneire The thrie Ambassats, so thay war content; Syne them rewairdit with giftis richt potent, Quhilk leave hes taine and hame raid suddanlie To their Princes, commending grittumlie The Kings honoure and [eik] his gentilnes. Meliades this lustie ?oung Princes, With [all] hir Courte [full] greatlie to advance, Aproached quhair the King maid residence, Whair monie Lords maid full grite reverence, Presentlie com before hir excellence, Fairlie hir met weiping with joy and blis, That schoe againe in hir cuntrie cumin is. Scho enterit in the toun right royallie, Quhilke stentit was with royall tapestrie, Into the honour of hir hame cuming; Minstrellis did play, and bellis long did ring. Full fast the pepill praisit hir bewtie. And so, with all hir Court of royaltie, On gudlie wayis scho rydis throw the toun, And at the Kingis Palice lichtit doune. And when the gudlie fresche Meliades Was from hir horse discendit on this wayis, And enterit in the close of the Palice, The King hir Father, with [ane] mirrie face, Upon his heid put on his nobill croune, Incontinent undid from him his goune And doublet, all alleane he hes discendit To hir quhom to he had so far offendit. Then all the Courte hade ferlie him to sie Go meit his Doghter in sik [ane] degrie. Rycht thair to hir he sate on kneis adoune, All bair heided, saiffand he hade on his croune, As not the father to the chyld sould do: Bot he so gritlie fail?eit hir unto; Whairfor he thoght he wald to hir amende. This Princes saw her Father and did attende, And saw him on his knie, and thocht ferlie; For scho was then abaisit grittumlie, And him before scho fell on kneis eike. The King wirdis lamentabill and meike First spake upon this wayis, I aske God mercie Of my delyverance cursit and hastie, And of my wit that beistlie was and wyld For to believe sike treasoun of my chyld: Syne I aske mercie at ?ow, Dochter deir, In this estait as I am sitting heir, Beseikand ?ow that ?e wald me forgive; For I repent, and sall do quhill I leive, The grite trespase that I have to ?ow wroght. With that from weiping he [refrain] might noght. His beard begane with teares to weit for sorrow As dasie buske bedewit in the morrow. Then all the pepill that this thing could sie, Full fast they weipit for rewth and for pitie, To sie the King regrate on sike ane wayes. This bening Ladie, fair Meliades, Heiring hir Father to hir compleaning so, Hir tender heart almaist it fell in two; For sorrow and pitie neir out of wit scho braid. I cry ?ow mercie, myne Father, scho said, Ryse up, my Lord, quhy sit ?e so, alleace; For it no thing perteinis to ?our Grace, To me, ?our Chyld, to sit upon ?our knie: Bot suithlie it pertenis unto me To sit on kneis to ?ow, my Father deir, My soverane Lord and Prince most inteir; For weill ?e knaw that I full humbillie At ?our command will do aluterlie; And, Father, I forgive ?ow hertfullie. And both with [that] they weipit pitiouslie. Than raise the King but ony wordis mo, And tuik his Doghter in his armis two, Whom that he lovit attoure all eardlie thing, And kissit hir with tender imbracing. Syne he resavit King Clariodus Into his armis, with countinance joyous; And on the samyne wayis his Cousings two With kinglie honour resavit he also; [Then the] Earle Estur and his Countes eike He hes resavit with ane visage meike; Syne all the Lordis and Ladies on be on He helsit hes. And quhen the Queine anone Hir Doghter saw, uneis scho might conteine, Or in hir heart so grit ane joy susteine, To sie hir in so gude prosperitie, That ordanit was so crewellie to die. Hir bairne schoe tuike in armis tenderlie, Ane weill long space imbracing heartillie; Schoe kissit hir [full] oft, with spreite joyous. Syne scho resavit King Clariodus, And syne [the] uther Kingis both in feire, Kissing them [all] with mirth and glaidsume cheir; The Earle of Estur eik, and his Countes, Resavit schoe with joy and mirrines; Than everie Lord and Ladie that was thair, Scho welcumit. Syne to the hall they faire, Whair seiges royall was gudlie to behold For foure Kingis coverit with cloath of gold, Above thair heidis siklyke thair was stent, Whilke to behold was pretious and potent. The hall was all arayit with the samyne, Thair was grit joy of menstrallie and gaming. So quhen thay war all enterit in the hall, King Philipon said this befor them all, Lordingis, it is not unkend perdie, How the knightheid and magnanimitie Of King Clariodus, [the] most famous, And alse his Father, worthy and gratious, This kingrik now exaltit hes so hÃ©, So that it standis imperiall of degrie, Nixt under France, of lawde, honour and fame, Whome fra nane mortall tribute may recleame, Out of [all] thraldome and subjectioun; And eik hes put our foes to afflictioun, Onlie be thame active and chevelrus, And speciallie be King Clariodus, That hes beine haill protectour and defence Into this regne, quhilk haid [grite] indigence Of help and comfort while he came in refuge, And uther regnes he maid unto us suge. Now with rewairde I wald faine him requite, That might doe him baith [honour] and delyte; And gif that heir for to resave him list, I sall him geive the thing that I love best, That is my Doghter, heare of this regioun, Thairto I gif my kingdom and my croun Heir unto him with hir in marriage, All unconstrainit, of my awin curage. For joy at onis the pepill all could cry, Thanking the King that said so worthily. Syne he said to Clariodus the King, Sir, if sa be that ?e no promising Hes maid unto no uther Ladie cleire, I gif to ?ow my onlie Doghter deire. Meiklie him thankit King Clariodus Of his grite gift that was so gratious, [Thus] saying, Sir, I dar ?ow weill assure, I ?it promittit to na creatoure, Nor covenant maid, nor conditioun, To earthlie wight into na regioun. And Sir, if that ?ow pleise into this wayis, To gif ?our Doghter, fair Meliades, In mariage to me, believe ?e sall Glaidin me more, and better please at all, Nor me to gif ane hundreth realmis faire, And all the riches eike under the aire. King Philipone on this most gudlie wayis, Delyverit thair this saire Meliades To King Clariodus; and he anone This fair Princes into his armes hes tone, Imbracing hir, and lowlie did inclyne Unto the King: but quho could all defyne The joy that did enter into his heart! With that the King alswyth did him revert Of Ingland to the Cardinall famous, And gart him handfast thame, and be joyous To go togidir in Godis holy band. When this wes done with feistis triumphand, Quhilk wer ane proces owir lang on to dwell, King Philoppon convoyit them him sell, And maid hir Queine of all his regioun; Syne in his handis two he tuik the croun, And on the heid of King Clariodus He hes it set with countenance joyous, And maid him King of all his regioun faire, Before the people all wer standing thaire. Than did they to Clariodus of knightheid well, ?eild thankis more nor I can think or tell, Reverencing him with all diligence. Bot he, before that gudlie audience, Said he wold not as ?it the honour have Of his kingrik, nor ?it the croun ressave So long as he on lyf wes it to bruike. ?it nevirtheles, thoght he it oft forsuike, King Philippon sik instance maid him till, That he behuifit to obey his will. Thus he of Ingland and Ireland both was King, To the [quhilk] ?it succeidis his ofspring. This beine donne, the dance anone begane, Grit joy and pleasoure was them amonge than. In chalmer they disport ane weill longe space, Whill that the supper almost redie was. The foure Kingis to supper all they went. King Philippon nobill and reverent, And King Clariodus sat at [the] tabill; Before them sate thir Kingis honorabill: King Amandur and King Palexis syne Sate before uther thair as ony lyne. The Cardinall of [richt] grite nobilnes Was set of Estur before the Countes, Next [to] the Counte at the tabillis ende; The discreit Marchell thair estaitis kende. And at the uther end, I ?ow assure, Sat the Duike of Glosester, and the Earle Esture: And syne ever ilk Lord sate in his degrie. They sowppit with triumph and mynstrallie. And efter supper quhen ischit was the hall, The Maisteris of Houshald them commandit all To go into thair Innis for that night Bot secreit Lordis. And than everie wight Devoydit beine that was not of Counsell. Than King, Queine, Lord, Knight and Damosell, To chalmeris went with mirrines and plesance. The Kingis foure with sade rememberance, Devysit togidder be themselves allone Anents the wadding how [that] all sould gone; And certainlie within ane moneth day For to compleit the mariage ordanit thay; And devysit what Princes of honoure, What Duikis, and what Lordis of valoure, Thay wald have at the forsaid mariage. And quhen the King with uther Lordis sage Had long devysit upon this mateire, Then went to beddis Knights and Ladies cleire. King Clariodus and his cousingis two Tuke leave alsweith, and could to chalmer go. This nobill Prince, full fresch and [full] lustie, Put on ane goune of velvote cramosie, And to his Ladie Meliades is gone; The quhilke up raise and kneillit hes anone. Then tuike he hir in armis tenderlie, And said into hir eare full quyetlie, This is ane strange warld that dois indure, When Ladies kneillis to thair serviture. Meliades than changit hew alyte, Of sike language that had no use persyte. And syne he schew to hir the namis haill, That he wald have to be at the brydell; And first the King he namit of Spain?e, And syne the King of Galice namit he, And his sister Madonat, of Spain?e Queine, And eik the King of Spain?es sister scheine, And Ladie Cadder that sould mariet be With King Palexis, as ellis hard have ?e. He spake of this and diverse thingis mo, Syne tuike his leave; bot ?it or he wald [go,] To hir ane gudlie diamond he gave, And of the Ladies rewairdit he the leave. When this was donne, he to his chalmer went, Syne for the Count his Father hes he sent, And with his counsall delyverit he hes anone In foure realmis foure heralds for to gone, And everie ane directit ane syndrie way, Thir said Princes and Ladies for to pray; And gart expensis delyver them anone; And thay belyve hes taine thair leave to gone. King Philipone gart make ane royall croune Of gold and stainis, richt pretious of fassioun, To this ?oung Prince, with uther riche aray, Of quhilk the maner war lang for to say. The King Clariodus gart grath also For himself richlie; so did his Cousings two; And ever ilk Lord, Ladie, and Damosell, Hes for them ordanit royall apparrell. Thus them I leive in mirth, joy, and blisse; So of this Taill the Fourt Buik endit is. THE FYFT BUIK OF CLARIODUS. THE PROLOGUE OF THE FYFT BUIK. In Mayis seasoune [that is] soft and sweit, When balmie liquore dois on leavis gleit, And bewis brekes and blomis upon breid, And pleasantlie inamillit beine the meid All ower depaintit with collouris new, Having passit the sea and cum to land, I meane the foure heralds out of Ingland; First two of them arryvit into France, And to the King with humbill reverence Thay schew thair credence and commissioun. He them delyverit with bening sermoune; And syne anone sent for the Constabill, Saying to him thir wordis honorabill, We have gude tydings of Sir Clariodus, Of two realmes now is he King famous; And heir anone he hes ane message send, Beseikand me to gif ?ow leave to wende In Ingland cuntrie agains his wadding day, The quhilke I grant ?ow, schortlie for to say. Hade he my selfe desyrit for to be, I wald not have denyit it perdie. ?e sall take threttie knightis of renoune, Whilke nobillest beine of all my regioun, To go with ?ow to doe to him honoure, Quhilk is of knightheid verie well and floure. The Constabill thankit him humbillie, And to the heralds did promit trewly Againe the day unto the tryst to wend. The nobill King bade oft him recommend To him, and to his Queine Meliades. And quhen thay war delyverit on this wayse, He gart gif them ane thowsand pound of gold, And two riche garmonds gudlie to behold. Thay thankit have this Prince of [hie] renoune, Inclyning low upon thair kneis doune; Syne tuike thair leave, and tuike them to the way. Into few dayis in Ingland landit thay; Whair thay aryvit, and schew unto the King As ?e have harde me say in everie thing, And how thay ware rewairdit of this wayes; The same they schew to Queine Meliades, And how the King and the Lord Constabill, Did them commend in wayis honorabill Unto the King and unto hir bewtie. And scho was glaide of thair prosperitie. Within awcht dayis efter thair cuming, The uther heraldis both come to the King, Whilk war delyverit on the same maneire. Then was the King richt glaidsume of his cheire. King Philipone aucht barrouns hade ordande, The most active that was into Ingland, To helpe the maisters of houshald to devyse And rewle his Palice on most gudlie wayis, And to resave with gudlie countinance, All Lordis, Knights and Ladies of pleasance, And eik all strangeris [baith] most and least, That with thair presence honour wald the feast. The Lordis awcht with all [thair] diligence, With grite triumph, laude and magnificence, Apperrellit hes the Palice royallie, And all the wallis coverit lustillie, With cloathes of gold, and stainis pretious, And riche arras with workis curious, With auld stories depaint and figurate; How Troy be slaughter was depopulate, And how the toune was taine be false ingyne, And how the wallis ware broght unto ruine: Thair was the seige of Thebis toun also, How oder slew the Trojan brether two, King Polinices, and King Ethiocles: Thair was the deidis of strong Hercules, And all his strength and courage leonyne: And thair was Jason with his cheire vulpeine: Thair was the Conqueise of nobill Alexander: Thair was of Cresseid the saikles slander: The schort persewing of Diomedes: The fervent love of sorrowful Achilles: The craftie winning of the Goldin fleice: The revisching of Heline out of Greice: The dreame of Paris of the Goddis superne, The bewtie of thame how he did decerne, And how he gave the apill to Venus: Thair was the weiping of Sir Troylus, When Cresseid did depairt frome Troy toun: Thair wes the forcie Trojane campioun, Most worthie Hector in armes invincibill, Chaiceing the Greikis with feir right teribill, With naikit sword in hand of bluid all reid: Thair was of Sampson the murthere, and the feid Betwix him and the false Philistiane: And thair wes Lucreis of hir awin hand slaine: And diverse Knights full trew and nothing faint, Bot monie ane fals woman thair wes paint: Thair wes the plaint full pitious and mone Of Arsyte and his brother Palamon: The treuth of Dido and Penelope: Of Clytemnestra the great crweltie, Wha slew hir husband with ane knyfe in bed: Thair wes Piramus and Thisbe both forbled, For sorow of other lay slaine be the well: Thair wes King Orphius, that out of hell His wife did bring with harping [wondrous] sweit: Thair wes Saturnus baneist out of Creit, In sik desert by Jupiter his sone, For he him drink gave of the bittir cone: Thair wes the storeis of all the Nobillis nyne: The half I can not wryte, nor ?it defyne, Of Campiounis the craftie depicturis, Seiming full quick, and livelie of figouris. All paithit wes the hall of marbill whyte. And cloth of gold furmonting of delyte Above the deice wes royallie upstent Of curious champis of rosis redolent; The buird cloth of the samin was but dreid, The silver seimit birning as ane gleid, Of stiff depurit gold [all] birning bright, Of stone and perle the bordour caist ane light. For the four Kings thair of estait withall In four places wer ordanit seidgis royall, With stone and perle [all] richelie resplendent, Lyk to the radious starrie firmament. The cuschingis of deaureat splendure schone, Ane fairer sight into the world wes none; And all the wallis wer full royallie Vestit with clothis of gold full richelie; And all the chalmeris on the samine wayes Arrayit wer full gudlie to devyse. The galleireis about the fresch gardingis Wer stentit all with rich apperrellingis. The Palice close wes fairlie paythit new With marbill stonis reid, [and] whyte and blew. It wer prolikis, and long of circumstancis To tell all haill the royall ordinancis, The fair apperrell and lustie fresch array That thair wes maid for the triumphand day. The gret Constabill of France full mightie Ordanit his Knights all, and maid readie To passe in Ingland to the mariage. And quhen the tyme was cumit of his passage, He tuike his leave full lowlie at the King, Whilk to him said, Sir Constabill, fair Cousing, Commend us to the King Clariodus, And bid him keipe the height he maid to us; Quhilk was to be [richt] glaid and have curage On the day of Meliades mariage, And we sall keipe all the avowis perdie Maid at the supper as weill knowis he; And bid him spair ws not, bot charge us ay, For we ar his in all that we do may. The Constabill said all sould be donne anone; He tuik his leave, and to the Queine is gone, Quhilk bad hir recommend in humbill wayis Both to the King and to Meliades. He tuike his leave, and to his horse ascendit, With all his Knightis that on him dependit; Lordis in France ane grite pairt of the way Convoyit him, and syne thair leave tuike thay. The Lord Constabill, and all his lustie sorte, Ar cumit to Calice and lichtit at the porte. And thair thay went to schippis all belyve, And into Dovar soune thay did aryve; And thair on horse thay mountit but abaid, And to the toune of Londoune furth thay raid, Whaire diverse Lords and marchands of renoune With grite triumph him met without the toune. And thair thay feastit him full royallie, And him convoyit syne full honorabillie Two myllis on gaitward, syne thair leave hes tone. To Bellvilladoun come this Lord anone. When King Clariodus hard of his cuming, He lape on horse but ony tarying Him for to meit, and bad his two Cousings, Of Garnat and of Castal?e the Kings, Remaine in Palice with King Philippon; And he to meit the Constabill anone Furth passit with ane nobill companie; And swa without the portis royallie This Lord he met, and syne did him imbrace, And him resavit with richt merie face; He helsit all his companie also; And syne blythlie unto the toun they go. He bad the Constabill ryd richt by his syd, Bot he refuisit equall with him to ryde; ?it nevertheles he strein?it him thairto, And his command behuifit him to doe. Syne speirit he richt heartillie of the King, And of his Princes lustie and beninge. He said, they heartilie greating to him send, And bad that he sould oft them recommend To him and to the Queen Meliades; And eik he said to him upon this wayis, The King prayit to keip weill ?our promit, And on no ways ?e to for?ettine it. And what he meint weill understude the King, And said he sould fulfill it in all thing; Thairwith he lewch, so did [the] Lord Constabill. And so thay raid with heartis amiabill, Whill thay to Palice come, and thair they licht, And up the gries passit they on height; Syne enterit in the hall, and that anone, Whair that the wallis [all] full brightlie schone; Whilk the Lord Constabill commendit grittumlie, And so did all the nobill companie. Syne thay have past to Philippon the King, To quhome the Constabill maid fair halsing; Then he him thair in armis did resave, And fairlie syne did welcum all the leave. Syne this Lord helsit hes the Kingis two, Palexis and King Amandour also; And thay resavit him on faire maneir, And all his folkis, both knight and bachileir; And then they spake of thingis to and fro. And to the Queinis chalmer syne they go, And thair thay halsit both the Queinis fair; And thay him quyte with wordis debonare, And kissit him with countinance demure, Syne speirit for the King, and how he fure; And also of his lustie Princes eike, And how scho fure, and all hir Ladies meike. He said thay both war in prosperitie, And did commend him unto thair bewtie. Meliades then said unto the Queine, Madam, if ?e of rememberance beine, Full oft or now I have [unto] ?ow told Both unto King and Queine how I was hold, And to the Constabill heire, my faire Cousing, To quhom I am addettit in grite thing. The Lord Constabill then said in this wayis, Madame, ?e say that bot of ?our gentrice, And of ?our sweit assurit womanheid, And nether for my service nor gude deid; Bot traist, Madame, efter my pure power, I sall be to ?ow ane servant singuler. When this said was, the Lord [then] went anone, And kissit all the Ladies on be one. As they abaid amongs the Ladies bright, Out of the hall alsweith thair come ane knight, And to the King Clariodus he said, The nobill King from tabill him abaid; Thair Kingis, Queinis, Lordis, fair Ladies, Com to the hall, all went on lustie wayis. Full reverentlie the King Clariodus Unto King Philipon [then] speikis thus, Sir, gif it pleasis ?ow, my Brother heire, The Lord Constabill and I will go in feire, And dyne into my chalmer quyetlie. Thairof, said he, full weill content am I. And then anone the King Clariodus The Constabill hes led furth joyous, With diverse Knightis of his companie. King Philipon to tabill royallie Was set betwix the [gude] King Palexis And King Amandur that [richt] worthie was; And at the end eike of this royall tabill Was set the Earle Estur honorabill Before ane famous Duike of that cuntrie; Syne everilk Lord and Duike in their degrie Was set, and servit wonder nobillie With pleasand meits and wyne aboundantlie. The King Clariodus greate feisting maid To the French Lord that he in chalmer hade, And to his Knightis fresche and weil beseine. Great mirth and feisting maid baith King and Queine. The menstrells plays with ane melodious soune Before thir Princes of so great renowne. When thay had sittine long on this maneire, Kingis, Princis, Lordis, and Ladies cleire, From burdes thay did up ryse, and said the grace. Clariodus the King, with great solace, And the Lord Constabill ar cumit to hall With ane cumpanie of Knights full royall. King Amandur and King Palexis Unto the Queinis chalmer can them dresse, Thir [said] Princes to bring unto the hall, Quhair thay in chalmer, and thair Ladies all, Dynis, as then of Ingland was the gyse. Thay war arayit on ane gudlie wayis. Meliades, this lustie [fair] young Queine, As ony Goddes fresch was for to seine, Into ane corsit of claith of gold all quhyte, Whilk was of fassioun wonderlie perfyte; Rich talbart sleves, [that war] long, large and wyde, Upon the eard behind hir trailling syde, As it was the gyse of Ingland tho; For in thaise tymis ladyis cled war so. Upon hir heade ane rosie chapilet Within ane roseire all in bright gold set, The roseis reid war all of cullour bricht, And carbunkle stonis casting plesant licht. Upon the roseire lustie to be seine, Insteid of leives hang emeroldis greine, Full freschlie pouderit all with leavis quhyt, Whilk to behald ane hevin was of delyte. About hir snow quhyte throte, as blossome cleire, Of curious warkis hang ane fair colleire. King Amandur to hall did hir convoy, As scho hade beine this worldis gem and joy; And King Palexis led hir mother the Queine; Thair followed hir monie Ladie scheine. And at the entrie of Queine Meliades, They hir beheld upon ane gudlie wayes; For certainlie it seamit to thair eye, That day by day incressit hir bewtie. The King said to the Constabill of France, Go ?e, fair Cousing, and begine the dance, And take into ?our hand Meliades. And his command he did on humbill wayis. He gart the King Clariodus also With the fair Duches of Yorke in danse to go. Full lustie Knights of Ingland and of France Anone enterit freschlie in the danse. Both King and Queine are in thair seiges set, With stone and pearle mightilie owerfret. Of Instruments up raise the mightie soune. Thair dansit monie Ladie of renoune; And uther Ladies, that list not for to danse, Sate with bening and gudlie countinance About the Queine, beholding on the feist. Thus war thay all in joy, both most and leist. In midis of thair mirthful melodie, Doune at the Palice ?et all royallie, Thair lichtit Kings and Lordis of honour, And lustie Ladies alse fresche as Mayis floure; With plesant Court [all] fresche and weill beseine, The mightie King of Spain?e and the Queine: And alse thair enterit in the Palice tho, The King of Galice and his Queine also, With fair Cadar, that lustie Ladie ?eing, With Donas sister to the Spanisch King, With Duikis, Earlis, Lordis and [eik] Knights, And monie uther fresch and lustie wights: And suddanlie thay ar all cumin thus, In witting of the King Clariodus. And when he wist, he [did] discend anone Unto the close with Lordis monie one, And them resavit [thair] full reverentlie; Syne led them to the hall honorablie. King Philipon, and eike the nobill Queine, And fair Meliades of bewtie scheine, Thir Princes met in middis of the hall, And them resavit with triumph royall. Bot thair men micht [have] learnit courtisie, To sie thir mightie Princes nobillie Reflect to uther, and reverentlie inclyne; And eike Ladies with havings femenine To utheris kneillit with sweit debonar cheir, With leuke bening and womanlie effeire. Fresch Mandonat, [that was] of Spain?ie Queine, Hir Father of Estur had grite pleasoure to seine; Eik of hir Mother schoe was thair joyous, And of hir Brother King Clariodus; Thay war so glaid of uther everie one, That long thay could not out of armis gone. The Princes all war led to hall and set on deice, And Lordis to the dance newlie did preise, And minstrellis to play againe begane; Amongis them was joy and mirthis thane. And quhen thus persavit hes Clariodus Sik number of folkis worthie and famous, The wyse Lord Constabill prayit he to take On him sike office for his Ladies saike, To have the rewle as [the] most principall, Abone the Lordis awcht in speciall The maisters of houshold, to command and correct [That thay provision make with due respect] Belonging to the feist in everie thing. And glaidlie he hes grantit to the King, As he that was of sik doings expert, For him suirlie thay micht no tyme escart, Bot he [ay] redie was in all maneir To make the companie merrie feist and cheire, Of Garnat, Galice, France and Spain?ie, Ingland, Irland, Esture and Castel?ie; For he thir Lordis hade all on his toung, All knowis he quhatever be said or soung Amongs them all; and eike he knowis perfyte, What may them greive, or quhat may them delyte: The Constabill of France all this he can, At sike ane tyme he was ane neidfull man. When thay had long disportit on this wayis, Whilk for to seine it was ane parradice, Then Kingis, Queinis, Princis and monie Lordis, Earlis, Knightis, Ladies and all accordis, To chalmeris went, at ease them to acray, And put on them ane lustie new aray; And thay at leasour changit thair cleathing, The quhyte lillie and tender flouris greine. Meliades the ding and lustie Queine, The fresch and new spred rose of bewtie scheine, Abuil?eit hir full fair and lustillie Into ane goune of satine cramosie, With orient pearles pouderat and owerfret, Whilk war full thike and grit thairupon set, Schyning upon the cramosie so bright, Of quhyte and reid full lustie was the sight, Whairof full weill might likinit beine the hew Unto the hevinlie rose with liquor new, Pouderit in morrow with cristall dropis lyke, The reid in equal junxit with the quhyte; And as the blossum honours the blossum in May, So did hir bewtie in hir [fresch] aray. Hir cleire cullour of angel lyke clemence Full far surmuntit into excellence All hir attyre and riche abuil?ement: And most of all hir vertew redolent Full cleire I wis abone hir bewtie schone; For in this warld ?it creatoure was none That ever persavit in hir crueltie, For scho fulfillit was of womanlie pitie, Whilk full was of assurit patience, Approvit be right grit experience; Ay humbill, symple, and schamfull under dreid Was this illustar floure of womanheid. Be this the maisteris of houshold in cum wer, And wairnit them to cum to the supper. Kingis and Princes then went to the hall, Queinis and Ladies [fair] went with them all. Betwix twa Duikis, fresch at all devyse, Unto the hall led was Meliades; God wit if scho was lustie for to sie, So entering them among in that degrie, Hir following in weidis freschlie dicht, Duchesses, Countesses, and plesant Ladies bright. Fyve mightie Kingis was set at the tabill, With them thair Queinis fresch and honorabill; Bot King Clariodus wald sit no way From the Lord Constabill, for togidder thay Held companie without dissaverance. This Constabill, full wyse of governance, Ordanit the hall so weill in everie thing, Alse weill in cheire as in thair marchelling, That he commendit was of everie wight. Fair was the hall and the supper that nicht. The King Palexis, and King Amandur, Oft sent to Donas and to faire Cadar Them praying to be glaid and make gude cheire. When they hade feistit long on this maneire, Foure maisters of houshald, that war honorabill, At the command of the Lord Constabill Servit them with the latter courses thair, With towell and water that was cleir and faire. When thay had waschin and [the] grace all said, From tabill then thay raise but more abaid. This being donne, the minstrells playit on height; Syne to the hall come monie ane Ladie bright, That soupit had in chalmer royallie: Thus pair and pair thay present pleasantlie. The King Clariodus commandit thair The Lord Constabill to take his Sister faire, The Queine of Spain?e, and leid hir in the danse; The quhilke he did anone without neance: And he himself the Queine led of Galice: The King of Spain?e led Meliades: The King Palexis led Donas maist bening, Whilk Sister was of Spain?e to the King: King Amandur led Cadar that was cleire, Whilk was the King of Galice dochter deire: Sir Gil?eam de la Forrest led the Duches, The quhilke ane Ladie fair and lustie was: Ane Countes led Sir Richard de Mayance: And utheris Lordis and Ladies of pleasance ?eid in the danse, with countinance demure. The King of Galice and the Count Esture Not dansit, bot abaid in companie With Philipon that was King [maist] worthie. The uther Ladies, that list not for to dance, Sat with the Queine, to pryse and to advanse Them that best dansit of that lustie sorte. And on this wayis glaidlie can them disport Ane weill long space. And quhen the dance was ceisit, Princes and Ladies to thair chalmers preisit. King Clariodus the Constabill hes taine, And to the King of Spainis chalmer is gane, And unto him he said, My Brother deire, I will my Sister borrow at ?ow heire, The Ladie Donas; thairto I ?ow exhorte, That we ane quhyle may commoun and disporte Into the chalmer with Meliades. The King him answeirit into humbill wayis, Fair Brother, all beine ?ouris that beine myne. With this to uther ather can inclyne. He tuike fair Donas, that lustie was to seine, And garte the Constabill of France leid the Queine. And then thay went upon the samine wayis, Unto the Kingis chalmer of Galice, And tuike with him ?oung Cadder that was faire. Syne to the chalmer glaidlie can repaire Of Queine Meliades; and in the way To Donas King Clariodus can say, Madame, I have to your Brother the King, Anent ?our mariage sent my wryting, Thairwith to be advysit of that cace; And I him thanke that in that mater hes Done all according unto my intent; And veralie, if that ?e wald consent, I wald ?e waddit Amandur the King; And suithlie if I trowit that this thing Sould ?ow displeise, I wald it schow no way; Now quhat ?e thinke of this to me ?e say. Scho said, My fair Brother, [full] weill I knaw That ?e no thing into this world me schaw Bot it according war to my honour; My Brotheris will and ?ouris at all houre I will obey. And this full soberlie Scho said, and smyllit sum deall quyetlie; Quhilk he persavit, and the caus [he] speirit Why that scho lewch. And quhen scho was requyrit The cause to tell; then said scho womanlie, Why that I lewch, if ?e rememberit be When with my Brother ?e war into Spaine, The trewth heirof I sall tell ?ow [all] plaine, When with ?our Sister weddit was the King, Betwix us two was quyet commoning, I spake to ?ow belonging ?our mariage, I lewgh quhen [that] I thoght on that language; For then certes thair was no man on lyfe Whom to that I desyrit to be wyfe Bot unto ?ow, quhairof none sould me blame To have desyret the Knight of nobilest fame In all the world, thoght I so symple was; For it perteinit to ?our nobilnes To have ane ladie of mair lustiheid, As ?e have now withoutin ony dreid. My faire Sister, said [King] Clariodus, I thanke ?ow of ?our [love,] that gratious Stude towards me into sike [ane] degrie; For suith it beine ane fair debait, said he, Of two fair Ladies upon sike ane wayes, Of ?ow Sister and of Meliades. With gudlie wordis and plesant commoning Thir lustie Knightis and thir Ladies ?ing Enterit in the chalmer of this ?oung Queine, Meliades the rose of bewtie scheine. Scho raise upon hir feit full courteslie, With all the Ladies of hir companie; And doun scho set the Queine, hir Sister faire, Upon ane couschen of claith of gold preclaire Abone hir self, quhilk alwayis scho refuisit; Bot at that tyme scho micht not be excuisit. With fair treatie scho gart hir take that place, And scho sate doune betwix hir and Donas. The ?oung Cadar scho gart them set before, That thay might at thair ease speike all the more. The King Clariodus and the Lord Constabill Commoned with uther Lordis amiabill, And them disportit with full grite solace. And monie ane lustie ladie fair of face Was in that blythfull chalmer of plesance, Ane with ane uther maid [thair] aquantance, Ladeis of France, Spain?e, and Inglande, As thay had all beine nureist in ane lande. Ilke King disportit theme full plesandlie Amongs thaise ladies that war womanlie. The tyme thay schorte with heartis glaid and licht, Whill neir the houre was cumit of midnicht; And thay war loath ?it than for to dissever, Thir ladies tyre of uther could thay never. Bot quhen the gudlie fresch Meliades Saw that thay wald depairt upon this wayis, Scho callit Romaryn, and gart hir gone Unto ane calfer, and gart hir fetch anone Ane croun of gold that massie was and wight, All set with stonis radious and licht, And two riche hearts of gold all birning new, Circulate with roobies and sapheiris blew. Into hir hand scho tuike the crounall scheine, And said richt thus unto the Spain?e Queine, My Sister fair, in France was maid this croun, And for that it is maid of new faschoun ?e sall it have with ?ow in ?our cuntrie; The quhilk for to resave full laith was sche: Bot scho hes hir besoght in sik maneire, That scho hes taine the croun of gemis cleir, Reverencing hir Sister grittumlie. The two heartis of gold that war lustie Scho gave to Donas and to Cadar faire; And unto everie ladie that was thair Scho gave rewaird and that full largelie. Quhilke the Lord Constabill persavit tentivelie, And ever ilk wight of hÃ© and law degrie Grittumlie praisit hir liberalitie. Thir Princessis hes thane thair leavis taine, Them to convoy this Ladie wald have gaine: Bot thay wald not hir suffer in no way; For it the use of Ingland was perfay, Ladies the nicht before their mariage Sould dwell in chalmeris, of auld usage, Whill thay went to the kirke to spousit be; So stude that Ladie in that ilk degrie. Efter the leave the King Clariodus Baid with the Queine, for he was amorous. They spake ane quhyle wordis plesand and faire; And syne he tuike ane diamond full cleire And gave to hir, and kissit hir also; And syne him grathit efter the leave to go. The Queine of Spain?e schew unto the King The gift that was so honorabill and ding, Unto hir gevin be Meliades. The King forsuith it [weill] can ruse and praise. Bot moir abaid ilk ane to beddis gois, Them with the nightis rest for to repose, Except worke men that war laborius, And bissie makand workis curious; Sum for the cleithing into fresch aray Of Lords and Knights; and sum for the turnay; Sum [for] to build the listis tuike grite cure; Sum bissie was for to forge new armour; And sum to make the barras great and wyde. Thus everie man was bissie to provide For thingis longing to this nobill feist, Whill that the day up sprang into the eist; And when that Phebus did all the world ouerschyne, Craftismen thair worke bissielie did fyne. When that the Duike of Miland hes hard taulde Of this wading, and quhan that it sould hauld, He sent thrie sommeris chargit richlie To King Clariodus that was worthie, Ane chargit was with cloth of gold full deir, Ane uther with silver chargit was most cleire, The third with silk the best in that cuntrie, For he was full of liberalitie; And to ane nobill man he hes them taught, The Knight Lumbarde, that in the listis faught With King Clariodus but variance, He callit is Sir AmÃ© de Plasance. Sex fresch varlots he did delyver thaire, And four stout squyeris with him for to fair. The Duike of Miland bad that he sould wend Into Ingland, and thair him recommend To King Clariodus in forme reverent, And thaise thrie sommeris unto him present. This Knight he maid no longer residence, Bot hes him sped with so grite diligence That he hade all compleitit his voyage Againe the day of the ilk mariage. And as the King addressit him to ryse, The Knight Lumbard upon ane gudlie wayis Is enterit in at the port of the toun, And at the Palice ?et is lichtit doune; Into the Court weill knowin was the Knight. And then alsweith as [that] thay hade ane sight, Of him thay told to King Clariodus, Of his cuming whilk was full joyous, And said that he wald presence have anone. Then soune ane [fair] message is for him gone. Thay chargit him to cum unto the King, And said, that he was glaid of his cuming. His four squyeris this Knight hes with him taine, And bad the varlots with the horse remaine, And to the Kingis chalmer passit he, [And kneillit doun, quhen he the King did sie,] Upon his knie richt fair and reverentlie. The King Clariodus full tenderlie Resavit him with full glaid countinance, And said, Welcum, Sir AmÃ© de Plisance, What tidings have ?e broght in this cuntrie? All guide unto your Hienes, Sir, said he, The Duke of Myland dois him recommend Unto ?our Hienes, quhilk with me hes send To ?ow thrie sommeris chargit richlie With cloath of gold and silver richt mightie. How dois my Brother the Duike, sayis the King, I thoght full long to heir of him tyding. At my depairting, Sir, richt weill fuire he, I left him into gude prosperitie. The squyeris went againe to horse glaidlie, And lousit hes the summeris bissilie, And broght the clothis thair unto the King, The quhilk them praisit into mikill thing. Thay oppinit them on breade upon ane tabill, The quhilk to sie was fair and amiabill. The King gart deale them all but more proces, And distribute them glaidlie more and les. The Kingis, Princes, and Queinis of honoure, And uther Lordis and Knightis of valoure, Thus distribute thir cloathis in this wayis, All bot two peices to Meliades. Then enterit in the chalmer the Constabill, Thanking the King on wayis honorabill Of the fair cloath of gold that he him send; And eike he said, that tyme it was to wend Unto the kirk. The King Clariodus Him vestit hes in cloathis full pretious, And put on him anone ane rob royall. Be this the houshold was arrayit all, To go to kirke into thair best aray, Thay war ane lustie companie perfay. Meliades, this ?oung and lustie Queine, Was in ane kirtill of cloath of gold beseine Of quhyte culloure, with curious champe of floure Pouderit with pearlis, as the bright dew pure; With mantill of the samyne, rich and deire, With taill full long, quhilk buire ane Ladie cleire; Ane broach of gold, with stonis casting licht, Togidder held hir glorious mantill bright. Ane royall croun was set upon her heid, Owerfret with stonis mightie blew and reid; And lustillie scho sat in seige royall, Of all bewtie as floure imperiall. The King Clariodus of grite renoune, With thrie Kingis triumphand under croune, Convoyit was to kirke full royallie. Thair was with him King Philipon worthie, The King Palexis and King Amandur, With monie ane Duke and Lord of [grit] honoure. Two mightie Kings of Spain?ie and Galeice To kirke leidis the fresch Meliades. Thair followit hir thrie Ladies weil beseine, In fresch aray and full of bewtie scheine. Full monie ane Ladie [bricht] did hir convoy; Thair was the Duches fair of Bellavoy; Of Beline countrie thair was the Duches fair; Of Glocester the Duches eik was thair; With monie ane uther Duches and Countes, And seimlie Ladies of grite nobilnes; The Ladie Cadder, and fair Donas also, Whilk honorabillie the Queinis nixt did go. And efter all thir Ladies fresch and scheine, Thair followit threttie Ladies weil beseine, All cled in cloath of silver of delyte, With perlit hatis schyning of cullour quhyte. Full monie silver trumpit and clarioun Befor them past with noyse throw the toun, With everie maner of uther minstrallie. The rewis all war stintit right richlie With cloathes of gold, and arras wounder faire. The royaltie I cannot half declaire Was them among on this triumphall day, Thair jolitie, thair festing, and thair play. To kirke thay come. What is thair more to tell, For he onlie, that is of Knightheid well, Beine spousit to the floure of womanheid, Before monie ane Prince of nobilheid, And monie lustie Ladie honorabill, [That marchallit war by the Lord Constabill Efter the order of thair nobilnes.] Ane Archbischope anone them maryit hes; Ane mese was singin ryght solemnitlie, With sound of organs, and with melodie. And quhen the service all [thair] endit wes, First can the King Clariodus him dres On gudlie wayis furth of the kirke to go. The King of Spain?e, and of Galice also, Convoyit him with monie Duike and Lord. And trewlie, as myne Authore can recorde, The King Palexis, and King Amandur, Alsweith convoyit this Princes of honoure Unto the Palice ?etis of renoune, The minstrellis [playing] with ane myrrie sound. Thay enterit in the close that was right faire, Abone arrayit, as ?e harde of aire. The gait and gries, arrayit to the hall, Was all of marbill quhyte, and coverit all With costlie arras and curious workis seire; Whilk thay ascendit have in fair maneire. This royall sort unto the hall is gone, Quhair the hie tabill was raisit anone; And on the deice on [the] most gudlie wayis Was set this lustie Queine Meliades; Hir Mother the Queine sate on hir right hande, And nixt her sate the King of Spain?e land, And syne the Queine of Galice fair to se, With Donas and Caddar baith full lustie, And syne of Belum cuntrie the Duches; And on hir uther hand [eik] set thair was The King of Spain?e, the Count of Estur, The King of Galice gudlie of stature, Of Brataleme the Duches of bewtie, The Duches of Bellavoy of Spain?ie cuntrie. When royallie the deice [all] set was thus, Anone the nobill King Clariodus, King Philippon and [eik] King Amandure, The King Palexis and [the] Earle Estur, The Lord Constabill and uther Lordis seire, Unto the grite chalmer went all in feire, The Maisters of houshold and Constabill before; They war all set, but ony proces more. The King Clariodus for?et hes nocht The Lumbard [Knicht;] bot garrit him be broght, And set him in ane honorabill place. The threttie Virginis, that war fair of face, Into the hall war marchellit them allone. All uther Lordis and Ladies everilk one Discreitlie set war efter thair degrie. The trumpits blawis with ane noyse fullie, Whill all the Palice wallis did redound. Ower all the hall the coursis did abound; Grite was the feist, and royall was the cheire, And pleasand was the menstrellis for to heire In hall amongs this royall companie; With intermeisis playit mirrilie, And small pad?eounis that war delectabill, Amongs the plesand coursis inestimabill: Whairfor the maner passis manis ingyne, To tell the meits also of syndrie kynd, Or ?it the wynis nobill and mightie, Quhairof the buirde was servit by and by. The Constabill said to Clariodus, Now sall it weill be knowin unto us, Be ?our having and be ?our countinance, If that ?e keipe unto the King of France That ?e promitit at ?our depairting, For now it is the day of hir spousing; Weill aught ?e glaid and joyous for to be For saike of hir the floure of all bewtie. Thus answeirit hes the King Clariodus; How sould ane man be glaider of his spous Nor he sould of his soverane Ladie be? Then lewch they both and maid ane mirrie glie. Then said anone to him King Philipon, Ha, [my] fair Sone, will ?e be of them one Unto thair wyfis that becumis thrall? Thairto no thing I counsall ?ow at all. Thus war thay all in joyous commoning. The Constabill, but longer tarying, Up raise and went to feist them in the hall. King Clariodus him callit thair withall, And privallie he roundit in his eare, And said, My Brother, ?e beire this rubie cleire, And at my only instance and requeist, It present to the Ladie of the feist; And say, The Knight fulfillit of all joy, Devoyde of everilk sorrow and of noy, In ane rememberance hes it to hir send, Unto hir bewtie doing him recommend. The Constabill the rubie tuike anone, And said, Glaidlie ?our message I sall gone; Syne throw the Palice he passit joyouslie, Convoyit with Knights wounder royallie. To the hie deice [anone] but more abaid He past with countinance right blyth and glaid, And all the Ladies [thair] of fresch bewtie, He feistit hes, that joy was for to sie, With mirrie wordis and [richt] pleasante cheir; For he ane maister was and no scolleir Into sike thing, as then it was weill seine; For he ane Lord of full grit nurture beine. When he had cheirit them ane weill long space, About the tabill he passit hes apaice, Whill he come to the Queine Meliades, And hir the rubie gave in secreit wayis, Saying, The Knight fulfillit of plesance, This ring ?ow sent in [ane] rememberance. Scho tuike the ring but ony persaving; For scho so steidfast was in hir having, That naine persave might be hir countinance When that scho felt of paine or of plisance. So happinit or the dinner was endit, That Sir Porrus of Portugall assendit Into the Palice, for oppine was everie porte, Full wyde upset, the trewth for to report; With him was knightis ten right honorabill, And twentie squyeris fresch and amiabill. This Knight be fortoune and be thrawart fate Into ane lyoun long was deformat, Quhill King Clariodus, be his chevalrie, Redeimit him be batell mightillie. Soune to the Constabill this was tauld anone, The quhilk foure squyers hes gart for him gone. And he anone hes cum to his presence, And helsit him with all dew reverence. The Constabill said, Welcum, Sir Porrus, For he him knew both worthie and chevelrus. He hes him reverencit, and said anone, My [gude] Lord, with ?our leave now I wald gone To Queine Meliades with fresch effeire, I have ane present [unto] hir to beire. The Constabill said, So mote I have joy, I sall unto my Ladie ?ow convoy. He hes him led to Queine Meliades, Whom the Knight helsit hes upon this wayis, Saying, The Lord, that power hes of all, Conserve ?our Hienes and estait royall, Togidder with ?our [most] great excellence. I comin am to thank ?our hie clemence Of the most blissull and happie delyverance Of my proterve missortune and mischance Be King Clariodus; for none bot he Nixt God micht of my fate delyver me; Whom to was no remeid, bot if the best Knight of this world, and eik the gentilest, Redemit me out of my paine and wo: Whairfor in [his] rememberance ever mo, That in this warld is of knightheid [the] floure, His airis sall be nureist with honoure Into this creddell of gold all forgit bright, Discending ay to his successioun right; Thus, sall his regall stok and his ofspring Have of thair nobill progenitours loving. With that he gart his armigers ostend The creddill of gold gudlie to commend, Of sik ane curious worke and quantitie Two men togidder might laide into it be. Then everie Prince and Princes at tabill Said that it was ane gift most honorabill, And said, thay had not seine so rich ane gift, Both of so grite ane quantitie and might. The Queine him thankit hes on fair maneir. The grite Lord Constabill sent for Bonvaleir, And him delyverit this jewell pretious, And bad him have it to hir thesaur hous. The Maisteris of houshold syne he did command This nobill Knight to feist with cheir pleisand. Thay him obeyit with countinance joyous; Bot first unto the King Clariodus Thay him convoyit have full gentillie. He him resavit and thankit full tenderlie Of his present. And syne unto the hall Thay go with him, and maid him feist royall. Thairefter at the portis can doune licht Sir Brounar de la Haunt, that gentill Knight, Of quhois schoulder the King Clariodus Drew furth the arrow that was venomus. He broght with him sex coursouris in gud plicht, And sex fair haiknayis as the snow [all] quhyte, And them presentit to Meliades. And he anone, upon the samine wayis, Declairit hes right [loud] before the tabill, How he of ane hurt [that was] uncurabill Lay in the tent remeidles day and night, Whill King Clariodus the gentill Knight [Had] him releivit furth of his distres; And so furth schew the maner mair and les, How in this world [thair] was no mediceine That na uther wight might worke be ingyne. Thay feistit him with glaid and mirrie cheire. The Count of Estur and his Ladie cleire Grite joy [than] hade in heart of the honour That to thair sone was donne in that [ilk] houre. Efter all uther intermeisis seire, As of the latter course thay servit wer, Twentie ?oung children of fourtine ?eiris age On tame lyounis quhalpis, I ingage, Full gudlie into purpur silk arrayit, Come in before them ryding unafrayit, Sadillit and brydillit and put to poynt at right; And twentie virginis that war blyth and bright, Of the samyne age, on unicornis fair, With harnischingis pleasant and preclaire, Abuil?eit freschlie in the samine hew, And all in hatis greine, and fair and new; And everie madine that was into that place Ane lustie varlot led in goldin lace, With speiris in thair handis everie one. And quhen thay war all enterit in, anone The madinis lichtit gudlie to behald; The varlots tuike thair unicorns to hald; And thay begouth to gang in carralling, And so with that so mirrillie thay sing, That everie wight thair beine had joy to heir, Thair voices was so angell lyke and cleire. And as the madinis song upon this wayes, The varlots justit and maid interpryse; And he, that from his horse was strikine doune, Gave to his fellow ane ring for his ransoun; And he that ring gave to ane Ladie scheine, And scho againe gave him hir hat of greine, And did full womanlie to him inclyne. [This done] betwix hir and hir fellow, syne Scho tuike him in the ring with grit plesance; Syne lustillie begouth thay all to dance. And this was donne, that everie wight might sie; For all the close of [full] large quantitie That day was ordanit to the triumphall hall, With cloathes of gold it was coverit all; And Lordis in the chalmeris round about At fenisteris and windowis luikit out. All saw playit this royall intermeis, The quhilke surmuntit into lustines So far, that thay hade wonder it to se, Saying, forsuith that thay in no cuntrie Hade seine siklyke into no tyme before. And quhen those madinis of bewtie so decore Had lang disportit [thus] and playit glaide, The varlots hes the unicornis to them hade, And set them on thair sadillis lustillie, Syne on thair lyounis lape delyverlie, And of the hall thay past without tarie, And Queine Proserpina with hir Court of Fari. The aucht Maisteris of houshald ordanit hes To draw the buirdis and to say the grace. At the hie deice upraisit was the tabill. Kingis and Princessis that war honorabill Dispoil?eit them of thair robis fair, And them delyverit unto heralds thair Of monie diverse realmis of grit honouris Into thair mightie Princes coat armouris, Quhilk gyftis gat to make them rich for ever. Ane fairer sight sensyne [thair] seine was never, Of Kingis, Queinis, Princes honorabill, Duikis, Lordis, and Ladies amiabill Within ane Palice nor was it in, I wise, Whair thair was nothing wanting of warlds blise. All minstrellis then with instruments are gone, Both lute, harp, viole, clarcheo, and guthrone, To play into the grite triumphall hall, Whair monie ane Prince in thair estait royall Abaid, with monie ane [lustie] Princes faire, And monie ane Ladie blyth and debonare. Then said Clariodus the nobill King To the Constabill his Brother, I desyre the thing, That ?e first go to leid into the dance My Lady my spous, for that war my pleasance; Quhilk for to do he did refuise at all, Considering thair was Princes in the hall Hir for to leid quhom [it] did more perteine: Bot ?it this Prince he will that so sould beine, For unto him he will doe that honoure, For he in France was Lord of grite valoure; Whairfor the King, of grite considerance, Both for the saike of the nobill King of France, And for his awin great wit and nobilnes, He did grit honour unto him dreidles. Then the Lord Constabill into gudlie wayis The dance begane with Queine Meliades; The mightie King of Spain led Cadder scheine, And the Duike of Bellavoy led the Queine Of Spain?ie cuntrie; ane uther Duike also With the Duches of Bellavoy in the dance can go; Ane Duches [eik] led Amandur the King, And King Palexis led Donas the ?eing; Ane lustie Earle of Ingland regioun Of Yorke did leid the Duchess of renoune; And eik the King Clariodus worthie Of Spain?e cuntrie led ane fair Ladie. Thair dancit monie ane uther lord and knight With monie ane ladie and fresch virgine bright. For?et was not Sir AmÃ© de Valeir, Nor ?it the nobill Sir Charles de le Scareir. Sir Gilliam de la Forrest thair did go, Sir Richard de Maianis dansit thair also. For to be mirrie thay neidit no requeist, For none war glaider nor thay war of the feist. Full long it war thair namis to declair, Or ?it to specifie thair dansing thair. The Queine of Ingland sat at the hie dice, With diverse ladies, both Duches and Countes, Beholding on the dansing with fixit eie. Grite was the joy, triumphe, and royaltie; Grite was the mirth, the pleasance, and the sporte, That was, God wote, among that lustie sorte. Full monie ane Knight with Cupidis awfull deart Amongs thame thair was woundit to the heart, Whilk efterwart of langour did complaine, Excellent bewtie so did them constraine Thair for to love all magrie thair intent. Full monie ane secreite luike among them went. With full desyre thair hearts war set on fyre, Throw lovis thrist, heatest of desyre. Thair the Lord Constabill hurt was with ane sight, Sum thing that day he wist of lovis might Onlie throw bewtie of ane ladie scheine, And at ane sight his heart all holdin beine To ane anone, as can my Authore tell; Upon sik thing as now I may not dwell. I will ?ow tell of ane [grit] aventoure By Ladie Fortunis purvenance and cure, Into the Court the quhilk betyde anone, Quhilk ?e sall heir, or that I farther gone; And efter that returne againe I will, And of the feist the leave will tell ?ow till. So happinit in the meane quhyle to be, Ane Herald come [thair] from Polyne cuntrie, Whilk callit was to name Bonadventur, Whom King Clariodus with bissie cure Had sent with credence to Polyne to the King, Him heighting in his weiris sum supporting Againis the Duike of Gravan, quhom betweine Full grit debait [thair] had [ane] long tyme beine: Bot thay agriet war or his cuming; Thus he returnit hame unto the King. When it was told to King Clariodus Of his Herald, that [he] was cumit thus, Unto his chalmer he went the neirest way, And for the Herald sent without delay. The Herald salust him upon his knie, Saying to him, the eternall God ?ow sie; The King of Polyne him to ?ow commendis, And to ?our Hienes heartlie greating sendis, ?ow thanking ofter nor I can heir reporte, Of ?our promit him to at neid suporte. He and the Duik of Gravan ar at ane, Betwix them two the weiris ar all gaine: Bot as I come out throw the realme of France, I saw the King make royall ordinance For tornament, for joy, for feist, for play At Pareis toun againe ?our mariage day; To quhilk was dressit monie ane Lord and Knight, And monie ane lustie Ladie blyth and bright, In companies thik ryding throw the fieldis, With bairdit steidis, harneis, speir and scheildis; And in the honour of ?our grit renoune, He makis all that great provisioun. And eik the Queine with all hir Ladies bright ?our wadding schupe to worschip at thair might With royall feisting, dansing and disport. And scho avowit befor that lustie sorte Unto the Powne that set was on the tabill, This King is suithfast and undouttabill. And ane thing, Sir, I sall ?ow tell for treuth, I saw ane sight quhairof I hade grite rewth, Bot heir without the toun ane litill way. Fyftine Knightis enarmit war perfay, Quhilk reveist fyvetine Virginis had unright, Thinking with thame to ly [on] this ilk night, And of thair virginities them to deflore. Full fast the Madinis mercie did implore; Bot thay with cruell heartis but pitie Demanis thame, that pitie is to sie. Then askit King Clariodus, if thay War passit far. He answeirit and said, Nay, I ges them ?it bot at the Woll, said he, Without the toune that standis by the trie, Whair Ladies usis in thair disport to go, It callit is the Ladies Woll also. On Bonvaleir than callit he anone, And bad him swiftlie for his harnes gone, And sadell him ane coursour that was wight, And bad the Herald go at all his might, Unto the postrum suddanlie him bring, And thair for to abyde on his cuming. With speir in hand [that was] both long and wight, Bonvaleir soune enarmit him [at] right, And he anone unto the postrum went, And on his horse ascendit or he stint. Upon his heid he did his helme on lace, And them commandit both into that place That they discover him in no maneir: Syne chargit he his varlot Bonvaleir, Alleane into his chalmer to sojorne All quyetlie againe quhill he returne; And if his brother the Constabill speire Whair he was gaine, to tell on this maneir, That he was in ane secreit erant went, And wald againe him speid incontinent. And than he tuike his mightie speir in hand, And swiftlie he did gallope ouer the land. Thir Squyeris both thay sat on kneis doun, Prayand to him that wore the bludie croun Him to conserve from all misaventure, Thay him betaught in Godis blissit houre, And to the chalmer soune returnit thay. Clariodus, in all the haist he may, Upon the Knightis followit hes so fast, Whill that he hes ouertaine them at the last, Saying, O Knightis, ?e abyde for shame! Doe not so grit dishonour to ?our name, As for to leid the Madinis on that wayis; The Ordour of Knightheid ye [do] dispyse, On sike ane wayis fair Ladies to offend; For ?e thair quarrell rather sould defend, Nor them to trubill so on sik maneir. Sir Knight, thay said, grit folie to ?ow it wer, As now to schaipe our deidis to correct, For at this tyme ?e may ws not object. I sall resist, quod he, if that I may. Thairwith the formest schupe him to assay. Thay set thair speiris sadlie in the reist, And awfullie towart uther thay preist; And certanlie the King Clariodus He hit him sik ane strake dispiteous, That horse and man went both unto the ground, Whill that his helme did from the eard redound. The second and the third doun run hes he So fellounlie, that naine was of thaise thrie Bot ather his leg or arme he brist in two. And quhen the Madinis saw he provit so, Right heartfullie to God they for him prayit. The twelf Knightis with heartis unaffrayit, Then set on him with swordis all at onis, Traisting to brist him, fell, blood and bonis. Quhen this persavit King Clariodus, With sword in hand as lyoun furious, Full earnestlie he enterit them amang; With mortall straikis he among them dang, That it was wounder him to behald and sie, For he begouth into his wraith to be; Was none so stalwart that his straik gainestuide, For as ane tyger that beine fearse and wode, He on them ruschit than with awfull faire, With bloudie sword thame chasing heir and thair, Bristing thair steill helmis in his ire and teine, Straiking thair steidis from them on the greine, Carving thair lymbis and armis ay in sunder, So monie of them thair steidis lay in under. The Knightis war abaisit grittumlie, Of him that them tormentit so fellounlie; Ane feind thay thocht him lyker nor ane man, For of his fighting ever mair he can. Thay straik at him so thik and fast withall As dois the hammeris on the studie sall; Thay woundit him upon the arme full sore, Whairthrow his courage incressit ay the more; For quhen he saw his blood rin doune so reid He grew in anger and in mortall feid, And on them ruschit with sik violence, With so grit furie and grit vehemence, He huntit them with [sik] ane feirfull cheire, Right as the awfull hundis dois the deire, And skaillit them full wyde before his face, As the fearse lyoun dois small beistis chase; Upon the greine he gave them tant for tant, Whill that thay grew so weirie and so faint, And put them so far to confusioun, That thay could not bot ly in thair ransoune, As ?oldin men his dintis to resave, And could not take the straikis that he gave. And quhen thay saw [that] thair was no remeid, Bot them to ?eild, or ellis for to be deid, Thay said to him at onis pitiouslie, Ha! Flour of Knightheid, grant to ws mercie, And save our lyfis, for thy mikill might, As thow that beine in earth the gentillest Knight. Then said the King, Gif ?e will have mercie, Go to the toun ?e sall standing us by; Unto the Kingis Palice ?e sall speir, And thair ?e sall enter but ony feir, Whair ?e sall entrie have for small requeist, And ?eild ?ow to the Ladie of the feist; Your prissoun sall be soft, I tak on me, If that ?e be all taine with hir bewtie; And eike ?e sall promit, or that ?e wende, In tyme cuming ?e sall ?our lyfes amend, And never againe doe Ladies sik unright, Bot ay defend thair quarrell with ?our might; And eik the Madinis ?e sall restore Unto thair freindis quhair thay war before. Thay said anone, We sall do ?our bidding Into all poynts, save onlie this ane thing, That is to say, to have thir Madins againe, Quhilk if we doe doubtles we salbe slaine. This weill considerit King Clariodus. The damosellis that glaid war and joyous, On kneis fell to him full humbillie, And wald his feit have kissit tenderlie; Bot he wald not them suffer to do so. So twentie Knightis fearslie come but ho, Upon thair steidis swiftlie at the spuris, To seik the Knights that donne them sik injuris, And wald with swordis have upon them beine; Bot King Clariodus lape them betweine, And said, My friendis, no worschip war ?ow to, Unto thir Knights more hermis [for] to doe; Then thankit be God of his eternall grace, Thir Madinis beine recoursit upon cace. And quhen they have [weill] understud that he Was onlie victour of so grit mein?e, Thay war sore wonderit into mikill thing, And come to him [full] lowlie inclyning; And him thay thankit thair with all thair might, As of the world the most nobillest Knight, And prayit him his name to them to kyth. And he anone hes answeirit them belyve, My name I never denyit, nor ?it sall, Clariodus of Estur thay me call. And quhen thay wist it was Clariodus, Thay fell upon thair kneis, saying thus, O nobillest Knight of most excellent fame, Out throw the world springin is ?our name; ?our knightlie deidis and heigh chevalrie, In laude and honour rings unto the skie; We ar not grit amervellit of this deid, Sen that ?e ar the flour of all knightheid, Whom God haith sent our chyldren to persew; We salbe faithfull servitours and trew To ?ow for all the dayis of our lyfe. The nobill King ane freindschip maid belyve Among the Knights; and syne did thame requyre That thay wald go with him to the suppeir. Thay have him reverencit full grittumlie, Syne to the Palice thay [all] raid glaidlie. The other Knightis maid varlots for to gone Unto the wode and litteris maid anone, Whairin thay have four woundit Knightis laid, And send them hame withoutin mair abaid With four varlotis in thair companie, Quhilk ludging tuik in the nixt toun thairby; Syne at the King thay tuike thair leave and went, Thair promise to fulfill incontinent. And he hes ridin againe the privie way Unto the postrom, as ?e hard me say. I leive now of Clariodus ane quhyle, And sumthing now my pen I will exyle, Schortlie to speik of thir elevin Knights, Quhilk to the Palice for to go them dichts. Thir Knightis at the Palice ?et lichtit doun, And enterit at the portis of renoune, Ascendit syne up the gries of the hall; Thay that them saw did wounder ane and all. As diamonds in armour bright thay schone, And thay all woundit war and bluid begone. To hall thay went and passit throw the preis, And or thay stint thay come to the hie deice. Anon the menstrells ceissit for to play, And Lordis left the dance for the afray; For as them thoght it was ane uncouth thing, In bluidie harneis to sie thair incuming. In sylence was the hall of most and leist. Thay speirit quha was Ladie of the feist, And thay tham kennit to Meliades. Then all on knies thay sat on humbill wayis, And said, Madame, unto ?our blyth bewtie We ?eild us heir all presoners to be, To do with ws ryght as ?ourselfin list; For of this world the nobillest Knight and best Ws all hes conqueist with his [awin] hand, And uther foure in poynt of death lyand. Syne quhen he had ws wone with grit mellie, From twentie Knightis of grit crueltie He ws recoursit againe richt nobillie, And ws conserved from thair fellonie. They callit him the Knight of joy compleit, Whois heart of everie plesour beine repleit. Then worde by worde they [all] the maner told Of thair meiting, and of the bargane bold, And of his knightlie strenth and his vigoure, And how he maid the [haill] discomfiture. When they had long his honour done proclame, Thay said, Madame, if ?e wald wit his name, Clariodus of Estur thay him call. Then full of blise and glaidnes was the hall, And thay all cryit with ane cheir joyous, Vive, vive, le Roy Clariodus! And that with sik ane [michtie] noyse and sound, That to the rufe the chalmer did redound. Meliades that blyth was this to heire, ?it changit nather countinance nor cheir; Bot with ane stedfast leuke debonarlie Scho all beheld the mirrie companie, And thankit God devotlie in hir mynde, That her rewairdit hade on sike ane kynd; And [that it] pleasit had his gratious will, The flour of knightheid to geive hir untill: And ?it albeit scho hade in mariage This nobill Knight of so hie vassalage, And understuid and right perfytlie knew That unto hir he steidfast was and trew; ?it Cupid hes hir strikin with his dairte, And newlie woundit hir unto the heart Throw new reporte maid of him be thir Knights In presence of so monie gudlie wights. What is thair mair to say of this mater; Both Kingis, Queinis, Lordis and Ladies cleire Full joyous war thir things for to heir tell Of him that beine of knightheid flour and well, And most of all Earle Estur honorabill, And fair Countes that was demure and stabill. King Philipone them treitit nobillie, And gart the Constabill treit them royallie; And syne the gudlie Queine Meliades Releivit them on fair and gudlie wayis Of hir prisoune, and sweitlie did them treite, And gave them gyftis honorabill and great. Thay tuike thair leave anone full courteslie, Reverencing thir Princis humbillie, And most of all Meliades the Queine, Dressing hir bewtie and hir vertew scheine. Syne soune upon thair horse ascendit thay, And to thair fellows tuike the neirest way, Quhilk thame abaid thair, bot [?it neir] at hand In ane village that callit was Garrand; To quhom they shew the grit nobillitie Was to them donne, and the grit royaltie Of all this feast; and of rewairdis grite Whilk was thame gevin thair they did repeit; And how Clariodus, of knightheid floure, Of twa realmis was famous conquerour; And thair thay did remaine whill haill and sound War thair fellows of everie grevous wound; Syne hame thay went unto thair awin cuntrie, And leivit ay in trewth and chevalrie. King Amandur and [alse] King Palexis, And the Lord Constabill that worthie was, Ascendit on thair horse and that anone, And with all bissines can them dispone To meit the King Clariodus in hy. The King of Spaine eik in thair company Wold have ridin; bot Philipon the King Did him requyer with wordis right bening, Whill thair returning to make residence, The feist to honour with his digne presence. And as thay went to horse on this maneir, Thay met the Kingis varlot Bonvaleir, Whom to the Constabill said, My frind, perdie ?e have this thing conseillit weill fra me, To schaw to me quhair that ?our Maister went. My Lord, said he, it war not pertinent To me to schaw, bot quhat he chargis me, Quhilk to consider discreit anewch ar ?e. Thairwith he lewch, and maid [full] grit gaming. Thir Lords to meit the King ar gone in samming; And soune thay saw him ryde a quyet way Unto the postrum ?et without delay. Then the Lord Constabill unto him raid, And on this maner lawghand to him said, I am of ?ow dissavit out of dreid, For I belevit ?e, sa God me speid, Had beine devysing sum strange abuil?ement Into ?our chalmer for the tornament, And ?e in uther materis bissie wer, As be the Knightis weill it did apeire, Whom into Court amongs we ?e [did] send; Thay maid ?our occupation to us kend. The Kingis two, quhilk war his cousings neir, Thay maid him mirrie companie and cheire. The Lord Constabill persavit weill that he Upon the arme was hurt at the mellie, And speirit at him if he was hurt ought saire; And he said, Nay. With that thay enterit thair In at the gardine ?et of the postrum. To the chalmer of Clariodus thay come. Thay passit soune and him unarmit then; And syne ane furrit mantill have thay taine, And laid it him about right softlie, And on his bed syne maid him [for] to ly, And to refresch him efter his weirines. King Amandur and [alse] King Palexis Commandit he to pase unto the hall, And glaid the feisters at thair power all, And gar them play and make withall disport, The quhilk to doe mirrillie thay them exhort. To hall ar went thir Princes honorabill, And with him left no wight bot the Constabill, And chalmerlandis with him two or thrie. And quhen King Philipon can behold and sie Thir Princes two againe returnit thus, He wist that cum was King Clariodus; At them he speirit the maner and the gyse Of all the mellie and the interpryse, And gif that he was hurt he did require: And thay to him declairit the maneire; That he was hurt thay wold not plainlie tell, For saik of hir that was of bewtie well, In cace thairof scho sould take displisance, Quhairfor thay maid ane mirrie countinance. Unto the King thay told all privilie, That he was hurt, bot ?it not hevilie; Of quhilk Meliades tuik persaving, And was affrayit into mikill thing; Scho swounit neir for inwart paine and wo. Dame Romaryn, that hir persavit so, Unto hir come, and sate doune on hir knie, And quhat hir aillit softlie speirit sche. Scho said, I dreid my Lord Clariodus Be hurt, quhairof my heart is dolorus; ?e sall unto him go but tarrying, And in ane taikine beir to him this ring, And cum againe and me the maner tell. Romaryn then no longer scho did dwell, Scho went to the chalmer of Clariodus, And on hir kneis softlie said scho thus, My Ladie, Sir, hes me unto ?ow send, And unto ?ow dois heartlie hir commend, For sair scho dreidis that ?e hurt [may] be; Quhairfor so full of hevines is sche, That scho uneis may keipe hir countinance, So woundit is hir heart with disperance; And this scho hes ?ow sent in tokening, Thairwith anone presenting him the ring. Romaryn in armis he did imbrace, And to hir said with glaidsum cheir and face, ?e sall my Ladie thanke richt heartfullie, And say unto hir verallie that I Do aill nothing bot that scho may amend, The quhilk alsweith sall unto hir be kend. On this ilk night scho salbe medicyne Unto my wounde, for scho is leich full fyne; And in ane tokine gif hir this roobie bright, And say, scho weill confortit hes hir Knight. Romaryn lewch quhen scho hard him say so, And undertuike for to remeid the wo Of hir Ladie, Meliades the Queine, That did of painis the hevines susteine. Scho tuike hir leave, and to hir Ladie went, And unto hir the tokin hes present, And said as he hir bad, but variance, In mikill thing quhilk lowsit hir pennance; And hir rewairdit with the roobie cleire, That hir sik tydings broght in this maneir. The Constabill, [richt] wyse and componabill, Raillit with mirrie wordis amiabill, And said unto the King Clariodus; This day I saw ane Ladie dolorous, Quhois cullour changit sumthing for ?our saike, Get up, and be alse strong as onie aike; Be all in joy, and thinke not of no paine; Ane sight of ?ow might make ane Ladie faine. Then lewgh the King, and said, My brother faire, Ladies in heart beine pitious ever maire. With that King Philipon, that was worthie, And eike the King of Spaine, com to visie Him in his chalmer with ane freindlie cheire. The King of Galice on the same maneir Com him to visie, and Earl Estur eike, Him to comfort with thair wordis [so] meike. Ane chirurgiane, that ware was and expert, Him tuike in hand to heill of everie sinart In syvetine dayis, that he might ryde and gang. He was ane grit maister chirurgiane. Thus raillit he with King Clariodus, Sir, unto ?ow it salbe nothing noyous, Gif on the night ?e just alse weill as day. He smyllit then, and said, Maister, perfay The trewth ?e tell; bot I have esperance Of my pairtie, to have ane soverance Mair in the night nor in the day had I: For I am ?oldin ellis right verallie Alreadie to my nichts pairtie traist perdie; Whairfor I think scho will more gratious be. The cumpanie then lewgh, and maid gud sport, And to the hall they went agane at schort, All bot the Constabill and two chalmerlanis, Quhilk still abaid with the chirurgianis, Whill visit all and tentit was his wound, And bundit up with sawis that war sound. Of purpur velvote he put on ane goune, With mertrix furrit curious of fassioun. He gave ane uther of the samyn sorte To the Lord Constabill, doing him exhorte Thairin him for to cleith; and thay anone Both in ane suit into the hall is gone. He put the goun on him at his requeist; Syne hand in hand thir two went to the feist, Quhilk lovit uther ay full tenderlie. Of Knightis followit them grit companie. Unto the hall thay went without delay, Whair all devysit was this mirrie play. Thay halsit have the mightie Princes hie, And thay resavit war full joyouslie. Meliades raise off hir mightie seate, Upliftit freschlie with two Earlis great. And this [fair] Prince full humbillie did inclyne, And hir he did imbrace in armis syne, And kissit hir and set hir in hir chyre; Then minstrells playit with ane mirrie fayre, And thair the dance thay have begune againe. Clariodus his Sister tuik in hande, The Constabill the Queine of Galeice toke; The ?oung Knightis for joy thair heartis quoke, And cheisit Ladies to go into the dance. Thus thay disportit with mirth and grit plisance; Full royallie the feast of joy began; Meliades scho dansit not as than. What sould I tell ?ow of thair grit delyte, Quhilk to rehearse almaist war insinit. When redie was the supper, then anone This lustie sorte ar to thair chalmeris gone, And changit thair arayis pleasantlie, And them abuil?eit new and lustillie In licht clethings, all ordanit for the dance, That for to sie it was ane grit pleasance. Of thair robis royall dispuil?et them the Kings, And on them put hes uther licht clethings. Then Ladies war arrayit full richlie. They enterit all togidder right seamelie Into the chalmer of Meliades; And scho, the flour of bewtie most to prais, Was cled in kirtill of claith of gold most deire, And of the samyn hir mantill schynit cleir. The croun of gold scho changit on hir heid, Whilk cast ane light of stonis blew and reid. Hir madinis all war in the samyn gyse, In glorious mantillis gudlie to pryse, Save that thay wore of claith of silver scheine. When Lordis and Ladies thus arayit beine, And everie wight, that pleasour was to se, The Maisteris of houshald, grite of dignitie, Unto King Philipon thay com and said, The supper readie was and on him baid. Than he commandit the Frensche Constabill, And the wyse Count of Estur honorabill, Unto the hall to fech the gudlie spous. Then followit Knightis gudlie and famous. To hall thay broght this ?oung and lustie Queine, As the hie deice anone up raisit beine; And scho was set with honour triumphand, With mightie Kingis upon ather hand, And lustie Queinis fresch and amiabill. And scho of bewtie flour incomparabill Surmuntit all the Ladies in the hall, As rubie hes renoun imperiall Of everie stone; as right as Phebus bricht Beine Lord and Prince of all etheriall light, Blinding the starrie hevine with his bewtie, Richt so hir bewtie, angel lyke to se, And blyth aspectis glaidis all the tabill, As parradyce of joy inestimabill. The King Clariodus and his companie Unto thair chalmer passit joyouslie, And sowpit thair with royall feist and cheir. The sound of trumpits mirrie was to heir, The coursis come of number inestimabill, With instrumentis glaid and delectabill; The wynis ran, that wight war of measouris, From horribill monsturis and fearfull of figouris; And other liquoris mightie and pretious Of dyverse wynis mightie and mervellous Ran out of virginis papis quhyte as snow: All kynd of fleuris in the hall thay flow: By incantatioun of grit practitioneris, By astrologis and art magicianis, Grite sortolegis with thair enchantments Of thair artis gave sik experiments, That thay appeirit lyvelie and visibill: Strong furious lyonis and dragonis horribill, Gaiping as thay the peipill wald devoure: Thair was hunting of all gritest plesoure, The hardie hundis of full grit quantitie Chasing the heartis with thair heidis hie: Richt pleasant war the coursis of birds above, Etheriall foullis in air might mak na rove For lustie falkonis that was gentill of kynd: All joy was, that man might have in mynd Everilk plesour that might revert in spreit: Fresch nightingells thair song with notis sweit, With blythfull birdis in the blomit spray, Befor dame Natur in hir fresch array. I can not tell ?ow in ane houris space The grite excelling pleasoure in that place, Nor of the joyous feisting infinit, Nor of the instruments of grit delyte, With dulce musicianis of princis chappellis seir, Quhilk song with curious craft and [wondir] cleire. It war ouer long heir for to declaire The intermeisis that war playit thair Amongs the coursis most delitious, Quhilk war of proces superstitious. The heralds and minstrellis that thair wes, Thay all full loudlie did thair cry Lairges Of the most royall Prince Clariodus, That gave them gyfts mightie and pretious. The supper long induirit on this wayis; [Clariodus then joyouslie upraise,] And Maisters of houshold gart raise the tabill hie. The grace was said with grit solemnitie, About and ouer the Palice circuleir. The noyse of ministrells mirrie was to heir, And everie wight [grit] joy and mirthis hade. Anon began the dance but more abaid, Incressis ay of mirthis more and more, With gritter preis of peiple nor before. Long war the proces [all] now for to tell Of thair disporte and joy that did excell, Quhilk till midnight [I wote] induirit still. The Maisteris of houshold then schew them till, That it was lait and tyme to go to rest; Then everie wight thair unto bedis drest. The Kingis of Ingland and [eik] of Spaine Hes tane this rose of bewtie soverane, Meliades, and to hir chalmer gois. Clariodus, of knightheid flour and rose, Unto his chalmer convoyit beine with Kings; Syne tuike thair leave with humbill inclynings. In chalmer thair with him abaid no mo, Bot the Lord Constabill that he lovit so, That he could not be but his companie. Four Knightis beine his chalmerleins worthie, Ane was Sir Broun de Lamour [full] wight, Ane uther Gil?eam de la Forrest height, Sir Richard de la Forrest was in feir, The ferd was Sir Penant de la Careire, Quhilk four to him so tender was trewlie, That he to them gave trest of his bodie. And quhen anon with them he was uncled, In furrit mantill he set hes on his bed, And him besyd he set the Constabill, And with him fell in speiking delectabill, Whill that Meliades in bed was gone, Whair Ladeis as than was with hir none Save hir awin Mother, and the Queinis two Of Spaine and Galice; thir wald not fra hir go, Whill scho in bed was brocht, and then anone Thay tuike thair leave, and to thair bedis gone. Then Romaryn, bening and gratious, To chalmer went to King Clariodus, And schew to him that the Queine was in bed, And he anone to [hir] chalmer him sped, And the Constabill into his companie, Quhilk then at his bed [side] richt privalie Tuik leave and bad guid nicht on humbill wayis. Clariodus to fair Meliades Enterit in bed quhom Venus did convoy, Not in his bed bot in his hevin of joy. What is thair mair, bot that the floure of armis Ane rose of bewtie lapit in his armis; And so thir two thay enterit in thair blise, Whilk with thair meritis weill deservit is; And thay, that lovit uther above all things, Passit that night with joy and thair lykings, Quhilk joy doubtles full deir was coft befor, Whairfor thair joy ay multipliet the more. I will not tak in hand for to indyte Thair joyis all, for them I can not wryte; For in sik thing I am not prakticate, Quhilk never my Ladie had in sik ane state. Termis I want sik materis to prefer, Quhairfor ?e loveris to ?ow I it refer, That taistit hes of the ilk samyne tune, And on sik wayis ?our Ladies now hes wone; For to consider thair joy is ouer measoure, Of love they have now fund the theasoure, Whilk long thay have with pane and pennance soght. I know the paine, the pleasoure know I nocht; The wo I felt, thought I the blis not bruike. O ?e my Ladies that luikis on this Buike, To ?ow I me compleine on humbill wayis, That she nocht bot disdaine for my service. Wald God gif [that] sum pairt of ?our pitie War mixit with my Ladies [rare] bewtie; For war scho mercifull as scho is faire, In all this world scho had non [to] compaire; In everie vertew naine micht hir amend. My mater now no longer to transcend, Thir loveris two full litill felt of sorrow, Whill bright Phebus them helsit on the morrow, In at the windo and on the courtines schone, And everilk wight adressit up to gone, With Kingis, Princes, and Ladies of honoure, And everie Ladie hir dressit in hir boure, And did thair bodies lustillie array, Lyk to the Mayis blossome on the spray. Clariodus, as on the day before, In clothing that was pretious and decore, Is vestit, and quhen tyme was opportune, For the Lord Constabill he sent full soune; Syne to King Philipon [anone] he went, Whair all the Kingis togidder war present. The Queine Meliades did freschile hir attyre In cloath of gold bright twinkling as [the] fyre, In kirtill quhilk was glorious to sie, Of purpure velvot ane goun on had sche. Ane lustie huid scho had upon hir heid, With pearlis quhyte and rubies lustie reid Sternit ouer all, quhilk Earle Estur hir send Into the morrow with ane recommend. Scho thus arrayit I let in chalmer dwell, And quhat betyde in Court now I will tell. The King Clariodus, on fair maneir, With the Lord Constabill, his companioun deire, Is to the King of Spain?es chalmer gone, And unto him thir wordis said anone, My fair Brother, [now] harkin unto me, ?e have ane Sister mariet for to be, Whilk is right fair, benigne, and gratious; And I ane Cousing have and Prince famous, Whilk is ane valiant Knight, as weill ?e know; War it ?our will, I wald that it war so, That our alyance might togider go [By mariage of thir richt nobill two.] The King answeirit and said, My Brother faire, I will as ?e will, schortlie to declaire, We think that alway it war convenient. He thankit him with wordis reverent; And syne he past unto King Philipon, And schew to him all haill how it was gone; And he was glaid. Thair is no more to tell. Arayit beine this lustie damosell On gudlie wayis, alse fresch as sould a bryde. King Amandur, upon the uther syde, Abuil?eit him in fresch and regall weid, As he that was ane Prince of nobilheid; And King Palexis on the same maneire, Whilk handfast was with Ladie Cader cleir; All for the mariagis dressit them anone, And thay all four ar to the chappell gone. Within the mightie Palice of renoune Up gois the trumpit and the clarioun. Convoyit thay war with nobill companie Of Kingis, Princes, and Lordis royallie, And mightie Queinis upon ather syde. I bid not on the proces to abyde; Thay mariet war with full grit dignitie, And halie consecrat efter thair degrie. The mes was song with not full curious, With organ sound and thimphand melodious. Efter the mes was donne upon this wayis, And finallie compleitit the service, The ?oung Quenis war led from [the] chappell With Kingis that in honour did excell; Then to thair chalmeris thay went them to recray, And alse to cleith them in ane new aray; And syne discendit into the triumph hall In the grite close that stuide imperiall, On lenth and breid, [on] height and [on] lairgnes, Of riche apparralling and lustines. The tabill up raisit richlie was anone. The two ?oung Queines to the hie deice ar gone With grite estait and regall dignitie; On ather syde sat Kingis fresch to sie, And Quenis alse [full] lustie to behold, In rich apparrall and regale cloath of gold, Whois radious rich apparrall brightlie schone With emerand and pearle but comparison In corronalds, bright jespe, and diademes. Bot if ane wight of death war in extreames, It sould him comfort and rejose to sie Thair excellent and imperiall blyth bewtie. When everie King and Prince of nobilnes, And everie Princes, Ladie, and Duches Beine set at tabill efter thair degrie, The trumpits soundit with ane noyse full hie, Whill that the royall Palice did resoun. Anon the coursis come with sik fusioun, That I wald irk for to report them heire, And ?e sould think it tedious for to heire; Or if I told ?ow all the circumstance Of them in Ingland, Ireland, and of France, Galice, Garnat, and [eik] of Castal?ie, Of Spain?e land, and of Estur cuntrie, How thay war marchellit, or quha maid them cheir, Or of the diverse intermisis seire, Or of the dulce and hevinlie minstrallie, Or of thair musike and diverse melodie, Or of thair diverse playing instruments, Or of thair plisant and trim abuil?ements, Or of thair mirrie cheir maid at the tabill, To tell or to report it war inestimabill; The sweit luikis and amorus beholding Betwix the Knightis and the Ladies ?ing, Or of the heralds in thair coat armouris Of syndrie Princes of grite honouris; Upon sik thing war long for to abyde, Whairfor as now I will let it ower slyde. King Amandur and King Palexis Rewairdit heralds with gold and grit riches; They cryit Larges all the hall about. And quhan all dynit had this nobill rout, Buirdis on loft beine raisit by and by, And graces said be Bischopis devotlie; And all the Lordis that in chalmeris dynit, Whois grite estait can not be [heir] defynit, Unto the court of nobilnes discendit, Quhilk unto nothing bot to honour tendit, Larges, jentrice, and [eik] nobilitie, Trewth, manheid, justice, and liberalitie; Away was falsit, away was wretchitnes, Away was nigardie and all skarschnes. None covitice let them of thair disport, Thair heartis gevin to all glaidnes at schort; Nor naine invy at utheris dignitie Might them depairt from thair cheritie; More grace amongs them wald aboundand be. [Full oft has beine sik royall companie;] Bot not alway exampillis, for to wryte, For so insatiabill beine thair apetite, That all the world micht slokin not thair thrist, Whill daith of clay ingrafe them in ane kist. Into this hall triumph and palestriall, Up gois the joyous sound instrumentall; With dulce, melodious hermonie and sweit, Raising the breist with curage, and the spreit Of them that lustie beine and amorus. Two Earlis, that beine worthie and famous, Thir two ?oung Queinis leidis to the dance, Whom matrimonie hes donne so advance. The Constabill leidis Meliades. Thir Kingis two full fresch at all devyse, King Amandur and King Palexis, Hes taine two Queinis of grit lustines, And dansit on [maist] fair and gudlie wayis Dansis that all men [ever] could devyse; Knightis and Ladies full gudlie for to seine, And virginis in thair dressit hairis scheine, The dance continuing with bening countinance. Thus they disportit them with all plesance, Whill that the supper was redie at all; Then unto chalmer went this court royall, And freschlie thair thay changit thair rayments, And pat on them for playis abuil?ements. And Ladies hes thair gounis laid asyde, And taine on mantillis that war large and wyde Of cloath of gold, purpure, and cramosie. The fair Meliades debonarlie Hes hir dispuil?eit of hir goune velvate, And put on hir ane rosey of dew bewate, Ane goune of gudlie hewit cramosie; Upon hir heid ane croune of gold mightie, Whairin was stonis pretious and decore, That worth ane Kingis ransoune war and more, With goldin chain?e about hir halse so quhyte, Whom to behold ane hevine was of delyte: Her proper persoun glorious was and gay. When everie Ladie hade changit hir array, To the triumph hall ascendit thay anone. Kingis, Princes, and Ladies everie one, War set at supper efter thair degrie. The silver trumpits maid a noyse full hie, The pleasant coursis come abundantly; And buirdis beine [all] servit by and by, The minstrellis sang with curiositie, Sweit as the marmaid in the orient sea. Full long thay sat and maid right mirrie cheir, And soune anone thay raise from the suppeir, And newlie gois to thair abaitments With joyous sound of pleasant instruments. Then all the nobillest King Clariodus For Emayne sent ane Ladie gratious, Of the chalmer of the Duches Bellavoy, Quhilk was of Spaine ane verie flour of joy, And hir delyverit to the Lord Constabill, To go in dance; and he right honorabill Thankit him lowlie and tuik her be the hand. Thir two ?oung Queinis, lustie and pleasand, Led with two Kingis dansit thair ane bease. Meliades be worthie Palexis Was led in dance as goddes Apolleine, Quhilk to behold was lyke ane thing devine. Thus thay disportit quhill it was neir midnight, Syne unto beddes thay passit everie wight. King Philipone and King Clariodus, With countinance mirrie and joyous, Convoyit unto chalmer lustillie Thir young spousis; and syne on wayis gudlie Thair leavis tuike and syne to chalmeris went. Thir two fresch Kingis, fresch in thair intent War of thir Ladies fair and weil beseine. Syne everie King taine hes his awin Queine, And gone to bed with thame with all pleasance: Bot now it war ower long ane circumstance, To tell thair grite pleasance and all thair joy; Glaider war never Sir Troylus of Troy, When he had Cressed in his arms windin, Nor war thir Kingis quhen thay to beds cumin, [To] thair lustie Queinis quhom thay loved long. Bot now the tyme me list not to prolong, For to declair ?ow all thair mirrines, Or into lovis the nights bissines. In joy and blise in armis still thay lay With glaidsum night, quhilk cumin was the day. Apollo restles and unfatigabill, Cleir in the eist devoid of habite sabill, Upon his course was cumin in the hevin, Twentie degries large and thairto sevin, Quhen everie King and Prince of nobilnes, And everilk Queine, Ladie, and Duches, Adressit them full gudlie in thair weid. Meliades the flour of womanheid Was cled in goune of velvote lustillie, Furrit with greice right fair and [full] seamlie; And of the samyne suite scho gave also Unto the new maid Quenis gounis two, And to the Queinis of Galice and Spain?e Two gounis of the samyne sort gave sche; And scho that wes of bewtie crope and rute, Did them beseik to go into ane suite With hir that day; and thay with cheire bening Hir thankit, and did grant to hir this thing. To mes thay went, and syne disjunit all; Syne to the skaffalds in lustie apparrall Went everie Prince and Princes amiabill, And everie Lord and Ladie delectabill. King Philipone with monie ane auncient Knight War set on skaffold to consave at right What Lord or Knight did best in the assay. The Knightis com all lustie in array In cloathes of gold full fair [and] schyning bright. Unto the rinke com monie seamlie Knight So weill at poynt that wounder was to sie. Of trumpits sound full noyis rais on hie. The French Constabill com first in the assay, On gudlie wayis in right knightlie aray, Servit be the nobill King Clariodus, Whois wound to him was ?it sumthing noyous, And for that cause he justit not as than. Thair might be seine monie ane seamlie man. The Constabill was in the range with him, Whilk than was [the] maist liklie for to wine. Of Bellavoy the Duike was [then] without, [And] servit be King Amandur full stoute, Weill accompanied with knightlie companie, For he all tyme was nobill and worthie. The Duike of Brisland enterit in the feild, In knightlie fassoun both with speire and scheild, In his inarming cleire as ony sonne, Quhilk as I traist sall not be lightlie wonne; And he was servit be King Palexis, Becaus he of [the] Galice natioun was. The fresch Knightis com far to the justing, Sir Charles de la Careir as ane lamp schyning, The nobill and duchtie Sir Ame de Valeir, Ane gratious Knight Sir Gorius de Grampeir, With monie uther lustie pleasand Knight. Knightis of Ingland schone as angellis bright, Sir Broun de Amouris cristalleine of hew, And nobill Sir Hewmon de la Mantigue, Sir Richard de Maianis of grite renoune; Sir Gil?eam de la Forrest of Scottis regioun, Ane Knight he was of fair conditioun; Thair was Sir Hew de la Bas of that natioune. The Knight Lumbard, Sir Ame de la Pleasance, Com to the preise with manlie countinance. Of Portingall Sir Porus of renoune Was thair, the Knight quhilk was the [weird] lyoun. It war forsuith ane grit prolixitie To tell thair namis all in thair degrie; For thair was both within and eik without Aucht hundreth Knightis that war [stark and] stout, ?oung, strong, [and] fresch, and also amorus, Antrus, ardent, and [alse] richt desyrus To do thair deidis valiant at thair might, In presens of thair Ladies and thair sight. Or onie Knight encounterit with ane lance, Thir Lordis heralds heighlie did advance In thair coat armuris of gold, stiffe and cleire; And with hie voice that all the feild might heire Cryit the heralds of the Lord Constabill, Poure lamour dele; [and] with grite joy thairtill The Duike of Brislandis heralds cryit hie, Sans poynt faltre; and so with royaltie Thair maisteris wordis thay pronuncit loud. Syne to the scharpe assay of knightlie schroud Addressit Lordis with thair speiris joynit; The cleirlyke trumpits and clariounis tunit. Thus Mars his sonnis chevalrus and bauld, In bright arming and triumph to behauld, Leiming of jespis wounder glorious, And provit in armis so victorious, That it war mervell for to be rehearsit; Thair hie valour with pen can not be versit. Thay brayit on utheris lyke lyounis and bairis, The air all rumblit with the crake of speiris, The earth about all dynnit and it schoke, The reike up raise [like] as ane smodie smoke; The trenscheons of thair speiris up gois on loft, Doune gois the Knightis with ane fall unsoft; With speiris strong so upon breist thay beit, The steidis wox all quhyte with fame and sweit; Cheildis lay scatterit in the feild full wyde, The bright helmis did from thair heidis glyde, The cleir scheildis beine all in sunder brist, Knightis beine out of thair sadillis thrist; The grit steidis togidder gois with gronis, Whill giltin ruifis rattillit all at onis, And bukillis brekis and birneis gois to ground, Whill with the reard thair breistis did redound. The grite Constabill of France regioun That day wan mikill honour and renoune; He did grit worschip to the realme of France, For monie ane Knight he drave doun with [his] lance; He fairis alse wode as lyoun in ane rage, Whois ardant heart desyrus might not asswage The thrist of knightheid, governance, and name; For scho was thair that maid him to eschame Of cowardyce and of slewthfull curage; He did suithlie full nobill vassallage, His knightheid scho enforcit with hir luike. Full weill then provit of Bellavoy the Duike; For he that was right famous of thir deidis Stronglie buire doune both Knightis and thair steidis, And did full valiantlie and lyke ane Knight. Sir Charles de la Carere, bold and wicht, Full weill he provit, as myne Author tellis, In fame of knightheid and chevalrie excellis. Rycht weill him held Sir Richard de Mayanis. The Knight Lumbard, Sir AmÃ© de Plisance, Sik wounderis wroght, that wounder was to sie, Throw his grite force and magnanimitie. And eik Sir Porrus de la Portingall On him that day did take so grite travell, And weill atchevit to the letter end. The Knights of Ingland wan full grite commend. And right swa thay of Spain?ie and [of] France, Thay rewlit [thair] with knightlie governance. For to behold it was ane nobill sight So monie ane valiant and so lustie Knight Into ane feild, [and] dought so long contine. The pepill had grit pleasance them to seine. To ryn at other did thay never fine, Whill bright Appollo wastward did declyne, And him ischerowdit in his mantill reid, And quhill the goldin traces of his heid Men might behold straught and lyneall Abone the earth, with beames colaterall, With ane deaureat supperiall light Leiming the grund; and whill he out of sight Bening descendit from his hemispheire, And Lucine of the hevine had the impyre, And lustie Venus schew hir lustie face, And let hir goldin traces out of leace, Glaiding the hevinlie ringe imperiall, And everie blythfull starne celestiall As roobie twinklit in the firmament. And quhan that nature maid impediment, And them denyit had the light of day, Thay most neids twine. Thair is no more to say, The King hes gevin command out of his seit, In trumpit sound to blow up the retreit; The quhilk command thay let no tyme ouerpas, The sound gois furth of silver and of brase, With sik ane noyse, whill all the listis rang; Men night of mettall heir ane hevinlie sang, When all the trumpits tonit up at onis; Then fra the preis the Knightis them disponis. Bot or the King wold off the skaffald discend, He askit quha the honour and commend Deservit for to have of the justing. The antient Lordis long war advysing, Full grit commend gave to the Knightis all, And them right hie did praise universall, Saying, in thair tyme thay never had seine More valiant Knightis under scheildis scheine, Nor better provit at justing nor tornay; Bot most the laud and the triumph they lay Upon this Lord the mightie Frenche Constabill, And on the Duike of Bellavoy honorabill. The King discendit from his scaffald doune; Kingis, Princes, and Ladies of renoune, Unto the Palice went full royallie, With the victorious sound of minstrallie; And everie Knight unto his ludging went. Clariodus, the Knight armipotent The Constabill led to chalmer royallie, Quhair he alsweith unarmit was hastillie, And put on him ane goun of velvote thair, Furrit with mertrix pretious and fair. King Amandur led the Duike of Bellavoy To chalmer with all melodie and joy. Be this the supper was alreadie dicht, The sex fresch Queinis, in attyre [full] bricht, Com to the hall arrayit nobillie, And at the tabill set with royaltie, With monie ane Ladie, Countes, and Duches, And monie grit Maistres and Barrounes. The Kingis in ane chalmer soupit all. And all the Knightis went unto the hall, That war all day with travell fatigat; The Lord Constabill grittest of estait, And Duike of Bellavoy ane buird begane; Syne efter thair degrie right everie man Was set at tabill, and servit honorabillie. Anone the trumpits blew up mirrillie, They maid grit feist with joy and melodie. Then buirdis beine [all] servit by and by, As thay in midis of the supper wer, Aucht Heraldis come in coat armour cleir, And aught Knightis [full] valiant and worthie, And askit at the nobill companie, Quhilk of the Knightis sould the honour have Of the justing and praise ouer [all] the leave. In hall they had diverse opinioun Amongs the Kingis and Princes of renoune What Knight sould have the lawd and the honoure, Them all thay praisit to be of grite valour; Bot to the Constabill thay gave grit loving, And to the Duike of Bellavoy conding. When this was said, Clariodus the King Sent to Meliades the Queine bening, And bade hir send unto thir Lordis two Rewairdis fair. The message furth can go, And schaw right as [that] ?e have hard devyse. And then the lustie Queine Meliades Baid Romaryne feche unto hir of gold Ane firmaleit and chaine fair to behold; And with fair Emayn of Bellavoy them send, And gart ane uther Ladie with hir wend Unto thir Lordis two. And quhen that thay Unto thair presence com, thus can thay say To the Constabill that worthie was and wyse, Our Soverane Ladie Queine Meliades Requyeris ?ow this chaine for to resave, As ?e that at the justing ouer the leave That war within hes won renoune and praise: Bot he alway that courtes was and wyse, Laith was the chaine for sik caus to resave; Bot nevertheles he most neidis it have, At the requeist of Princes him about. He thankit them and courteslie did lout, And gave [to] them two diamantis faire. The Ladies kneillit with cheiris debonair, And to the Duike of Bellavoy the firmaleit cleir Thay have presentit syne on this maneir, Saying, The lustie Queine ?ow sent this gift. He it resavit withouttin ony schift; The Queine he thankit, and gave the Ladies gent Two royall rubies bright and redolent. Thir Lordis two hes taine thir Ladies bricht, And to the hall them led, whair everie wight Had soupit and up rysin from the tabill, And enterit in ane dance full amiabill. Thair thankit they the Queine Meliades, And syne begouth the dance in humbill wayis With thir ilk forsaid Ladies in thair hand. Full glorious wox the feist and triumphand Of glaid disport: bot it did not long lest, The mirrie Knightis mister had of rest, And went to bed anone and sleipit still, Whill bright Phebus schynit ouer holt and hill. And be [that] it was fullie houris nyne, Full gudlie Knightis cleir and cristallyne Enterit againe into the lustie meid With scheild and lance enarmit upon steid, And justit all the day continuallie; Whairof the hie renoun and victorie, As [that] myne Authore tellis for certaine, Wes gevin to the mightie Duike of Brisland, And to the Duike of Bellavoy thir two. The feist triumphall glaidlie induirit so The tyme compleit of monethes two all out; Grit was the joy amongis that blisfull rout. Clariodus, the best and nobillest [King] That levit then efter Mars his ring, Gart make ane generall Proclamatioun In everie province of his regioun, That every vail?eand Knight [thair] under scheild Compeir sould on sik ane day and feild, And for his Ladies love to rin ane lance, And for the luif, and uther circumstance. The day is cumit, and eik the Knights also. Grit was the preis that in the field can go; Thair might be seine monie ane lustie Knight Of countries strange, inarmit schyning bright Againe the face of Titan, leiming cleire Of redolent stonis pretious and deire. All Kingis, Queinis, and the Ladies fair, War set on scaffalds plesand and preclaire, Beholding all the maner and the gyse Of everilk Knight and of his interpryse. Thair namis dar I not discryve at all; For of this haill world universall Thair beine the chose of all [of] hie renoun Of Knightis of all syndrie natioun. The justing was begun with triumph sound, Whill it redoundit from the cludis doun. Knightis of Ingland, Galice, and of Spaine, That day did not all thair deidis in vaine, For monie ane Knight and horse doun thay buire, Nobillie thay provit, and did long endure; So did the strong Knightis, the suith to say, For monie ane fair course was run that day: Bot he that beine the patron of all Knights, The sone of Mars of bodie and of mights, I meine Clariodus enarmit bright, This potent Prince, as planeit casting licht, Schynit all of stonis and of carbunkellis deire. As Jupiter surmounting in his spheir, Or Lucifer in pairting of the night, So all in gleime and glorious as angell bright, He enterit in the field and that anone; For then all noy of his wound was gone. His mightie speir he faikit in his hand, And on his steid he glydit ouer the land, And buire the Knightis from thair horse alloft, And on the grund maid them to fall unsoft; Might none resist his straikis of sik force, Befor his face to grund went man and horse. Him to behold it was ane ferlie sight, For he was of sik strenth and of [sik] might; Right as the agill in the air at will Devoris the terrestriall volateill, And dantis the etheriall birdis small; So the terrestriall fame victoriall Ringit in him of knightlie governance. Nocht can my pen discryve, nor ?it advance His valiant deidis nor his chevalrie, So far as might be reasoun satisfie Him that in French hes red this historie; To sik ane rethorik nather be laud and glorie, As unto him that did this buik compyle In French, illumining with his goldin style; And he, that did it out of French translait, Hes it depaint of langwage full ornate, And lustie termis richt poeticall: Bot I, the third and secundest of all, Can not so meitter as thay put in prose; Full oft I put the nettill for the rose, And oft the bindweid for the lillie quhyte. The god armipotent might have delyte To sie his knightlie fair and governance, His hie regall victorious importance. His mightie corpis stark and unfatigat Maid monie ane Knight to ly on face prostrat. From sum he straike the helme, and sum the scheild, And sum he laid on groufe upon the feild, And sum he ran doun fearslie and eik his horse, To leive the place behuifit them on forse. The Constabill, that on him followit ay, Sik wounder had to sie the grit deray Amongs the Knightis hurling on the feild, He did huife still long tyme, and him beheld, And mervellit on his strenth and hie curagis, That as ane furious lyon on them ragis. King Amandur and King Palexis, Wha fillit war of manheid and nobilnes, So weill them held, that wounder was to tell, Full monie ane Knight befor thair lansis fell. The royall houshold of King Philipon So nobillie thair lansis did dispone, That monie ane Knight befor them ?eid to grund. Was never hard in all this eard so round Of fairer justing and nobiller tornament; For then under the starrie firmament Of knightlie fame and lawd was Britan bauld, As ?it us tellis the Chronicles auld. So hapinit then ane Knight in feild to be Of grite vigoure and [eik] strenuitie, That he in diverse landis was victoure, Feill Knightis war conqueist be his valoure. Of jyant corpis was this grit campioun, Out throw the feild he playit the lyoun, With mightie speir as Mars he did furth ryd, Defoyl?eand Knightis foullie in his pryde. To sie his bright enarming was delyte, Correspondent to his corpis perfyte, That fair it was to leuike on sike ane Knight, Fulfillit of sik vertew and sik might, Quhilk radious was, and redolent of hew, Of Leslay he height Sir Leonard Perdew. Melancholike he brunt of pure invy, That Sir Clariodus the King worthy So far in valiant deidis did excell; Quhairfor alse wod as ony tiger fell He set on him with mightie lance in hand. The nobill King him mightillie gainstand. Thay fruschit thair speiris freschlie in sunder So fellounlie, to sie that it was wounder. And quhen he saw he could him not vincus, Then he requierit King Clariodus Him for to draw apairt, and to assay, Quhilk of them two vinqueis [the] other may. Clariodus him grantit hes this thing. And then withoutin ony tarying They drew them to ane syd, and hes anone From thair squyeris two mightie speiris tone, And raid at uther, schortlie to conclude, Right as two dragonis that war fearce and wod; Thair seiris brake and sprang into the air, The royall Palice reardit with the rair. And syne with all thair courage and [thair] might Thay strake at other with thair swordis bright. As two wyld boaris irouslie thay faught, From both thair helmes the low ?eid as fyrflaught Throw dintis fers on [the] hard forgit steill, Thay did assay if it was temperit weill, Quhilk rang full loud and gave an awfull sound, Thair brandis cleir wantoun up and doun Againes the sonis fervent beamis bright; Unto the pepill terribill was the sight. Thir cruell Knightis with thair feirfull cheir Ruschit on uther ay in sik maneir, Whill helmis [and] habrigis all to brist; Out throw the steill full fast thay [ay did] thrist. So sad straikis thay [did] on other set, Whill both thair brandis bloodie was and wate. Sir Leonard for ire almost grew wode, That he so long in feight againis him stude, And him micht not vinqueis in no maneir. In scheith he put his sword of mikill cleir, And trowit with his vigour and his force To draw the nobill Knight from [off] his horse. Clariodus persavit him anone, His steid he spurrit and toward him is gone, And in his forcie armis wight and strang, He did the Knight out of his sadill swang, And laid him on his hors nek him before, And to the barras magrie him full sore Him buire, and set him doun curagious. They cryit on height, Vive Clariodus! The stalwart Knight full soune on fute he wan, He said, Thou art ane quike devill and no man; For I have beine in Spain?ie and Itallie, In Denmark, Duchland, and throw all Germanie, ?it fand I never thy peir into no land. To blow the retreit the King gave command; For than Phebus had put his course to end, And bright Venus did in the eist ascend. I may not tarry all the proces on; Kingis, Lordis, Knightis war warnit anon, And schortlie cled into [full] rich array, Syne to the hall they went the neirest way; For thair the tabillis war richlie bespred. Then Kingis, Quenis, Ducheses them sped Unto the deice to thair seats honorabill, Whair thay war servit with coursis inestimabill; For to discus thair is no man on lyve, That can the twentie pairt thairof discryve The grite triumph and feisting beine and cheir, Whair that sa monie Knightis beine in feir. Right as the latter course come in the hall, Then Heraldis in cote armours royall, And twelf Knightis that aigit war and wyse, Quhilk in thair tyme [richt] mikill was to pryse, Unto the hall they ar all went in feir, And cleirlie the opiniouns did speir Of everie Prince and Lord of grit renoun Whois was the laude for [the] conclusioun Of all the Knights that in the justing wer, And who most valiantlie did perseveir, And who the helme [had] conqueist and renoune; For it the maner was in that regioun, That who at justing or at tornament The honour wan, thair was to him present Ane mightie helme circulat with gold cleir, And circumferat with stonis that war deir. They spake of monie [grit] and diverse Knight, Of worthie King Palexis that was wight, And of his brother Amandur the King, And the Lord Constabill nobill and conding, Sir Charles, Sir Porrus, Sir AmÃ© de Plisance; Thay said they beine all worthie to advance. Grite worschip spake they of the Duikis twane Of the cuntries of Bellavoy and Brisland, And of Sir Leonard de la Pardew, Whom King Clariodus out of his sadill drew. Bot King Clariodus they most commend, And finallie they all did condiscend To give him all the lawd and honour hie, To quhom no uther wight was so worthie; For thair might Knightis be of [full] grit fame, Bot nothing all to his imperiall name; For he in grie stude [ay] superlative Abone all uther Knightis [fair] in lyve, In fame of Knightheid and of fortitude: Whairfor the companie did all conclude The helme of honour to give him onlie, That prysit beine the flour of chevalrie. Be this was said, aucht Virginis fair to sie, In tracit hairis of ferlifull bewtie, Four of Spain?ie, and four of Galice land, Com in the hall with countinance pleisand, And broght with them the helme deaureat bright, Owerfret with mightie stonis casting light, And set it doun before him on the tabill, Saying to him with wordis amiabill, Sir, be advyse and counsall generall, Of Kingis, Princes, Lordis, ane and all, This aureat helme is maid for to be ?ouris, For the grite worschipe and the hie honouris That ?e have won with mightie speir and scheild This day at tornay, be justing in the feild. Clariodus thankit the Virginis ?ing, And also he remersit everie King, Saying, thairto he was not dingne nor abill, And offerit it unto the Lord Constabill, Quhilk it refuisit, and so did all the leave; For he himselfe most neidis it resave, Constrainit be the nobill Princes all. Then he upon ane Armiger did call, And gart ane Maister of houshold come him till, Quhilk callit was Sir Henrie Gordonill, To quhom he rounit and ordanit secreitlie, To have the Heraldis with him quyetlie To his wairdrope, and thair rewaird them all, And give them gouns of cloath of gold royall; And bad him give of silver and of gold To everie ane ane thousand merks doun told; And to the Knights he gave twelf coursers fair, [Into this world none might with thame compair.] Richt as he bad this Lord hes donne anone. Syne he commandit two squyeris for to gone To chalmer with his helme; and ordanit eik, That thay sould take with them thir Virginis meik, And tak aught goldin chain?eis avenant, And put to everie chaine ane diamant, And [syne] put [thame] about thair throttis quhyte; The quhilk was donne, schortlie [for] to indyte. Thir Knightis and the Heralds all in feir Enterit againe unto thair suppeir, [All] remersing the King Clariodus, In presence of the companie famous. The Heralds cryit Larges upon hie Of the grit gentrice and liberalitie Of the most hie, excellent [and] mightie Clariodus, the flour of chevalrie. Thus soupit thay with joy and mirrines; And syne [thay] from the tabill can them dres, And enterit in the dance full lustillie With hevinlie sound of hevinlie minstrallie. Clariodus hes causit the strange Knights With Ladies dance; and so the lustie wichts Weill long disportit them on this maneir; Syne spyce and wyne was broght with mirrie cheir, Depairting syne the companie with joy. Clariodus full glaidlie did convoy The strange Knightis unto the Palice ?et, And gart be given to them giftis grit, Robis of silk gudlie [and fair] to sie, With gold and silver in grit quantitie. Thay tuike thair leave and to thair lugings went. At morrow as bright Phebus did up blent, Thay raid into thair cuntries everie one, And schew unto thair Princes thair anone Of all the feist the fassioun and the cheire, Of all the justing, also the maneir, And of the fredome of King Clariodus, And of his knightlie deidis [and] famous. The nobill Kings of Spain?ie and Galice Bad ordane thair estaits in gudlie wayis, To pas at morrow hamwart but delay. The night ower went, and cuming was the day, The Kings did them addres in thair array, And maid them redie with all hest thay may, And thair two Queinis; and syne went in feir And tuike thair leive on gudlie fair maneir At Philipon [the King] and at his Queine, And syne [anon] at his Court all bedeine. In the meine quhyll Sir AmÃ© de Plesance, The Knight Lumbard but longer tariance, Sir Fortun de Amouris, and nobill Sir Porrus, They schoupe to ryd; to quhom Clariodus Gave grite thesawre [of] riches and monie, And cloathes of gold most pleasant for to sie, And gart convoy them with fair companie Of Knights that beine [richt] nobill and worthie. Thairestir soune thir Kingis excellent, And eike thair Queinis, in maner reverent Thair leave hes taine at all the Court royall, At everie Lord, Ladie and damosell, Bot at Clariodus and the Lord Constabill, Whilk them convoyit with Court most honorabill Unto thair schipis quhilk did on them abyde, Whair mony royall gyfts on everie syde Was gevin and taine with monie rich jewell, With cloathes of gold, that was [ane grit] mervell To be rehearsit to ?ow in this place. Then to the sand discendit thay in peace, Reddie to enter all into thair schipis, Lordis in armis each other thair beclipis. The King Clariodus, that was worthie, Imbracit thir two Kingis tenderlie, And eik the Queinis two he kissit ifeire, And thay in barges enterit afe the peir. And last of all his leave tuik pitiouslie At his Father the Earle full tenderlie, He him imbracit and eik his Mother syne, And reverentlie to them he did inclyne. God waite thair was ane sorrowfull depairting, They weipit all with teiris distelling. And Mandonat with sorrowfull effeir Hir bright visage bedewit all with teir, Thus with hir onlie Brother to depairt. The sword of dollour did glyd throw hir heart. For to behold the sight was dollorus, And the depairting sore and pitious, Betwix the onlie Sister and the Brother, And more betwix the one Sone and the Mother. I will not longer tell ?ow of thair sorrow, Anone they twynit with Saint John to borrow. And be the sameine houre the nobill King His leave hes taine with heartlie imbracing At the two Kings, and right so at Palexis, Syne at the Earle Estur of worthines, And at the Queinis, and at the fair Countes, On ather syde kneilling with humbillnes. The guid Lord Constabill tuike leave also At Kingis, Queinis, Ladies; and syne did go To schipis sweith quhair saillis went on heicht. They go to seawart as [ane] foule on flicht. Sa weill of winde servit them Eolus, And so the flude temperit Neptunus, That to the land approachit thay belyve, And into helthsum portis did arryve; And everilk Prince and Lord in thair degrie Ar passit hame in gud prosperitie, Whair thay resavit war with [all] blythnes, And leiveit in joy and in mirrines; And ofttymes heartlie greating sent betwine To King Clariodus and to his Queine. The King Clariodus that nobill was, King Amandour and [eik] King Palexis, The Constabill, and all thair companie, Returnit hamewart ar full mirrillie, Whair that thay fand the King with his Court all Disporting them with triumph royall; With joy and pleasance pat thay afe the night. And on the morn as Phebus gave the light, The Constabill anone did him addrese Unto his schipis with all bissines, And tuike his leave at Philipon the King, And at the Queine and at hir Ladies ?ing, And at the [lustie] fresch Meliades; And this he did upon most humbill wayis, Whair monie [ane] rich gift and jewell great Was gevin and taine, quhilk I will not repeit: Bot trest ?e weill that wo was everie wicht For the depairting of the gentill Knight. On horse he hes ascendit suddanlie, And surth he raid with all his companie. Clariodus he fand without the port Abyding him with ane [richt] lustie sorte Of Kingis, Lordis, and Knights of honour; Both King Palexis and King Amandur War in the Court with all thair companie; And furth anone thay raid full mirrallie, Whill [that] thay com to the sea strandis cleir, Whair that the schipis all [full] redie wer. The King Clariodus and the Lord Constabill With friendlie cheir and wordis amiabill Imbracit uther they have tenderlie, And thay that lovit uther heartfullie Uneis might hold them from weiping then for wo When that thay wist they wald fra uther go, Promitting other with humanitie For evermore treuth and fidelitie; Syne tuik thair leave at uther pitiouslie. The nobill King, that could weill courtesie, Tuike leave [then] at Sir Charles de la Careir, And at the worthie Sir AmÃ© de Valeir, And [syne] at the French Knightis everie one. Full monie ane jewell of gold and pretious stone Amongs them gevin hes the nobill King. And syne his Cousings two, thir Princes ?eing, Thair leave has taine at the Lord Constabill, Imbracing uther with wordis confortabill; And efter that he went into his barge, Quhilk pullit up anone hir saillis large, And ower the fluid [then] freschlie did he fair, Alse swift as dois the Eagill in the air; At Calice thay arryvit esilie, And thair alsweith [thay] tuike thair harborie. And on the morne as cleirit up the day, They all prepairit and put them on the way, And bissellie they sped them day and night, Whill [that] of Parice walls thay gat ane sight; And so withoutin rest this Court furth raid Straight to the Palice quhair the King abaid, And syne discendit from thair horse anone; And the Lord Constabill to the King is gone, And helsit him on knies full reverentlie, And he resavit him full joyouslie. This Lord apairt [syne] went with him but mo, And schew at lenth or he wald farther go The pleasant cheir of the triumphall feist, And all the intermeisis most and leist, With all the grite disport and abaitments, And of the royall justing and turnaments, And of the commendatiouns ane and all Whilke war unto him send in speciall. Glaid was the King his wordis for to heir, And bad that he sould on the same maneir Go schaw the Queine the tydings delectabill. At his command [soun] went the Lord Constabill, And helsit hes the Queine and hir Ladies. Scho him resavit in ane joyfull wayis. He told hir all the maner mair and les, How treitit him Clariodus of nobilnes, With all the heartlie commendatiouns Of Kings and Princes of full great renouns; Of quhilk scho was [richt] joyous for to heir, And so was all hir lustie Ladies cleir. The King for joy gart cry ane grit justing Into the honour of his hame cuming. In mirrines and joy I leave them thus, And speik I will of King Clariodus. Returnit is the King Clariodus, And his two Cousings nobill and famous, Unto the Kingis Palice of renoune; And he, that was imperiall under croun, Obeyit was with sik estait royall, That in this warld King was none mortall Whome to was donne more worschip and honour Nor to this Prince, of chevalrie the flour; And this was donne ower all Britane so braid. When he aught days thair sojornay had maid, He for his four Maisters of houshold send, And them he hes commandit then to wend, And ordain richlie for his hie estate, Arraying all thing that beine pertinat For him and for his Queine Meliades, That all sould redie be on gudlie wayis Within aught dayis for to take the sea; For he his Cousings with all royaltie Wald put in thair realmes, and them convoy And leave them thair to ring as Prince and Roy. Thir four Lordis past [furth] without demand, And in all heast fulfillit his command. When all was readie as him list devyse, He tuike his leave, and eik Meliades, At Philipon the King, and eik the Queine, And prayit God thair keiper for to beine Into the realme whill thair againe cuming. And he anone hes taine in hand this thing. King Amandur and eik King Palexis Thair leave hes taine with all grit humbilnes At King and Queine, and all thair companie, And on thair horsis ascendit royallie, With more triumph nor I can ?ow defyne; And thay anone raid to the port marine, And thair anone went to thair schips ifeir; Bright was the hevin and Phebus schyning cleir. Thay raisit saillis bent unto the height, And fuire ower fluide as falcon fair on flicht; And in fyve dayis, as Dame Fortoun wald, Toward the land [full] lustilie thay hald, And saiffe arryvit into Garnet land, And into ane toun callit Varrogand. The Thrie Estaitis of that regioun Full gloriouslie them met with trumpit sound, And with ane nobill and lustie companie Them all [out] throw the cuntries fair thay gy, Whill thay com into the toun of Durant. The tounschip thair with maner richt plisant, Met them with sound of diverse instruments, With intermeisis and blyth abaitments. In Palice regall, with feist and grit honour, Anon resavit was King Amandur, And thair as Lord thay maid to him homage: Thus Fortoune hes him set in full hie stage. The King, quhilk had resignit him the croun, Was then profest into religioun. Ane moneth out thay sojornit in that land In feistuall joy and pleasance triumphand, And syne Clariodus his leave hes taine, And eike Meliades his soverane, At Amandur and Donas eik his Queine, So did Palexis and lustie Cadar scheine: Bot nevertheles they haive done thame convoy Unto the sea; bot thair was litill joy; At thair depairting pitie was to tell. Whan thay had done full long in armis duell, King Amandur and eik his lustie Queine Hame to thair Palice againe returnit beine, Whair thay full long did leive in joy and blis, Joysing the realme in peace as thay wald wis. The King Clariodus and his companie In schippis enterit hes, and suddanlie They drew up saillis and ouer the wavis schare. They glyde anone alse swift as onie fyre, And day and night thay sojorne not nor rest; Bot furth thay held ower fluid with saillis prest, Whill towards Castal?ie Eolus them draveit, Whair thay struik saill and suddenlie aryvit; And syne on horse full royallie ascendit. The Lordis of the land on them dependit, And throw the cuntrie them convoyit with honour. And he that was the realmes governour, He met them in the toun of Gandaleyis, And feistit them on [the] most gudlie wayis. On morrow furth thay raid with royaltie Unto the principall toun of Castal?ie, Quhilk callit was the toun of fair Vallance. They enterit in the Palice of plisance, Whair that the antient King did them resave, Both Lord and Barroun, Knight, and all the leave, Them welcoming and seisting with great cheir, And to them gart be maid ane grit denneir. Thair coursis all to tell ?ow it wald cumer, Thair intermeisis so war out of number. When thay had dynit, the King of grit renoun In both his handis he tuike his royall croun, And put it on Palexis heid richt thair Befor the companie condigne and fair, In his rob royall alse he did him vest; Syne King of all his realme [he] him possest; And he him self of heigh devotioun Anone did enter into religioun. Thay sojornit still with pleasant abaitments, With feisting, justing, and with tornaments, Whill [that] sex oulkis war out worne ilk day; Syne tuik thair leave withoutin more delay. Palexis them convoyit to the sea, Bot the depairting pitiouse was trewlie Betwix him and his Eame Clariodus. To twin with other thay war dolorus, The quhilk never twinit for weill nor wo, Uneis thay might depairt utheris fro. On everie syd they tuik Saint Johne to borrow Agane to meit, quhilk levit hes thair sorrow. Ather did uther imbrace and said Adew. This King Palexis hameward did persew, Unto his Palice into fair Vallance, And with his Queine thair levit in plisance. The land he rewlit as ony wald devyse, And keipit it in peace and in justice. When that the nobill King Clariodus Now schipit beine and all [his] Court famous, In Irland thay did suddanlie arryve, And thair on horse ascendit they belyve, And throw the toune of Gargaly [thay] raid, Ane fair village, with wallis heigh and braid, Whair two mightie Duikis of that regioun, With diverse utheris Lordis of renoune, Him met, and to the toun him did convoy Full plisantlie, with honour and with joy, And him resavit in ane Palice fair, And royallie that night him feistit thair; And as thair King thay made to him fewtie, And swore to him the aith of fidelitie. Alse sone as he the morrow did espy To horse he went, and all his company, And raid out throw the cuntrie at his will, Whill he com to the toun of Marmavill, Surmunting all the tounis of Irland, Whair that the auld King was [as ?it] livand. He enterit at the ports of the toun, Quhilk was arrayit of ane rich fassoun. The streitis stintit war full royallie With arras and with silkis most mightie, The minstrells playit on diverse instruments; Full monie sports and monie abaitments Devysit war before him on the streit, And full of joy was all the toun repleit; The mirrie sound of trumpits did out thring, And all at onis did the bellis ring; The tounschip met him in thair best array, Him doing all the honour that thay may. He enterit in the kirk full royallie, And thair he lightit and his fair Ladie; And quhen [that] they had maid ane orisoun, [And mess was singin with an hevinlie sound,] Unto the kirk he liverit grit thesawre; Syne to the Palice raid with grit honour, And thair anone from horse they did discend, And up the gries unto the hall they wend, Whair that the antient King into ane chyre Was borne with Knightis them abyding thair, Whilk grevit was with age, and febillit so That he might not into thair meiting go; To quhome the King Clariodus is gone, And heartillie in armis hes him tone. Thir Kingis two imbraicit uther thair With plesant wordis that war sweit and fair. Now am I glaid, this aigit King can say, My deirrest Nevoy that sie now I may Within my realme in sik prosperitie, I cair not now quhidder I leive or die. Then off his heid he tuike his croun pretious, And with it crounit King Clariodus, And to him did resign his regioun. When of this thing was maid conclusioun, His chyre to chalmer was borne royallie; The syd of it buire two Duiks honorabillie, The uther syde Clariodus the King Up buire, and so to chalmer did him bring, And on his bed him set [then] full softlie. Then King Clariodus full courteslie Tuike leave as then, and to the hall is gone, [Whair that the dinner readie was anone.] Grite was the feist, and pleasant was the cheir Within that hall of diverse coursis seir. When thay had dynit and rysin from [the] tabill, Lordis begouth and Ladies delectabill To dance anone, and minstrells gane to play. The portis oppinit war, the suith to say, And thairin enterit everie lustie wight, That list to dance, to sing, or to have sight Of that glaid feist, surmunting in plesance, And everie wight maid plesant countinance At the cuming of thair new Prince and King; For song and play the long hall [all] did ring. The feist was great and lestit inteirlie Ane monethes space, it lestit larglie With glaid disport, justing and tornament. Clariodus the King most excellent Of Lordis he had diverse mariagis, For to inforce with Irland his linagis. He maryit thair the sex Virginis cleir, That winit with the Ladie de la Careir, With potent Lordis of Irland cuntrie, That nobillest war and gritest of degrie; And Romaryn he wadit honorabillie Upon ane Count of Irland right mightie; Sir Gil?eam de la Forrest he mariet also, And Sir Richard de Mayanis they two With two grit Countesses of that cuntrie, With all the feistis and grit royaltie; And fynit war the mariagis all With justing and with tornament royall. When he sex monthis had maid sojorning, And was obeyit both with auld and ?ing, And conqueist all the heartis of that land, Then under him he maid ane Livetenand; Syne he his leave hes taine at the [auld] King, Wha was sorrowfull at his depairting. Diverse Lordis and Ladies of renoun, He tuike with him to Inglands regioun. When he his leave had taine at everie wight, Then to the sea he schortlie hes him dight; Heralds greatlie of gold and of money He left behind him into that cuntrie; Syne with his Court he raid out throw the toun With sound of trumpit and of clarioun. Convoyit him to sea his Luiftenand. And quhen thay war discendit to the strand, First at the King he tuike his regiment, And syne he tuike his leave and hamewart went Unto the King with commendatioune From King Clariodus of grit renoune, Saying, that soune againe he sould returne, And longer then into the land sojorne. Blyth was the King to heir of his rehearse. Up gois the saillis preisit in the mase Of all the schipis of King Clariodus, Whilk be support of the god Eolus, And be the help of him and lord Neptune, Thay war aryvit in the cuntrie soune. Thus quhen Clariodus arryvit beine, Both he and eik Meliades his Queine, Went to the land with all thair companie, And on thair horse ascendit royallie, And throw the cuntrie raid with Court royall The tyding ran out throw the cuntrie haill Of thair hame cuming, both to more and les; And unto Belvell first thay can them dres, And thair they hard how that the King anone, And eik his Queine, war in religioun gone, Nocht fra the toun two mylls in ane Abay, To quhilk they did returne but more delay; And thair this nobill Prince [hes] lichtit doun, And eik his Queine Meliades of renoune, And enterit in the Abay in feir. This auntient King and Queine advertist war Of thair cuming, and com in thair meiting. They helsit uther with tender imbracing, And kissit uther on ane freindlie wayis. And quhen the King and Queine Meliades Had commoned long with them on this maneir, He tuike his leave, so did this Ladie cleir, And said thay wold againe right oft returne. When thay had long tyme maid with them sojorne, On horse thay have ascendit, and furth raid Unto Bellvilladoun but [mair] abaid, Whair all the piple him met with trumpit sound, Crying, Welcum our Prince of most renoune, Uneis for throng he might thring in the streit, All circumstance I omit to repeit. Then at the Palice portis of renoune, He and his royall Court all lightit doun, And unto hall ascendit, and that anone, Whair he resavit Lordis monie one, That wounder glaid was of his hame cuming, For thay him lovit ouer all uther thing. The Lordis of Irland, that war with the King, Seing the joy maid at his hame cuming, And how he was lovit in his cuntrie, Thay thoght in happie tyme chosen was he To be thair King and alse thair governour, Whilk of this world was Prince of most honour. The King gart mak ane Proclamatioun, And send Heralds in everie regioun, That thay, that wold renoun in armis win, Sould schaw, and thair ane tornament begine In the realme of Ingland on sik ane day; And quha desyrit knightlie to assay His nobill deidis, thair sould he servit be. And soune the tyding sprang in ilk cuntrie, Of quhilk the King of France was blyth to heir, And all his Court both Lord and Bacheleir. So happinit quhen the Heralds com to France, The Lord Constabill with royall ordinance Was makand war furth into far cuntrie; Whairfor the King, full valiand of buntie, Send threttie Knightis to the tornament In right knightlie and fair abuil?ement, Led be the Knightis thrie of nobill fame, The first Sir Charles de la Careir to name, The secund was Sir Charles de la Valeir, The third Sir John was de la Barneir. Thir threttie Knightis war so diligent, That two dayis befor the tornament They com to presence of King Clariodus, That glaid was of thair cuming and joyous. Then speirit he of the King, and how he fuire, Thair speirit he of the Queine of lustie figure, Then how the Constabill did eik askit he. They said all war in gud prosperitie, And that both King and Queine did them commend, And heartlie greating to his Hienes send; And said the Constabill in Bethingham is went, With men of weir at the commandiment Of the nobill King, quhilk chargit him so. Then was the King Clariodus full wo That he not cumin was with them, for he Him lovit for his wit and his buntie. Quhen thay had spokin long upon this wayis, He bad them pas to Queine Meliades, And schew to hir the novelties of France. Two Knightis them convoyit with plesance Unto the Queine, quhom thay full courteslie Helsit, and everie thing did specifie To hir as thay did to the King before. And scho, that was of bewtie so decore, Glaid was to heir of the prosperitie Of the gude King of France and his mein?ie, And of the Queine that was so honorabill, And of hir Ladies fair and amiabill. In chalmer war thay put for to recray, Syne efter war in joyis all the day. Upon the morne, from monie far cuntrie Com monie ane Lord and Knight of grit buntie. King Amandur, and eik King Palexis, Hes Knightis sent of full grit nobilnes. The King of Spain?e and [the] Earle Estur Send lustie Knightis of [full] grit valoure. The Count of Glocester, with fair mein?ie, Cumin is from the cuntrie of Spain?ie, Not with Clariodus ?it seine is he; For quhan he was into Spain?e cuntrie, This nobil Count of manlie effeiris Upon the Saraseinis lay at the weiris. So monie Lords and Knights is gatherit thair, That fillit was the royall Palice fair. What is thair more to tellin of this thing, When cumin was the day of thair justing, The Knightis com all armit in the feild, Whair thair devoir they did with speir and scheild, That grit plisance it was them for to sie. The Ladies sat upon skaffaldis hie. Anone the trumpits blew ane mirrie tune, And so with lancis did the Knightis june; Both heir and thair to grund gois horse and man, The earth dinnit as thay togidder ran: Bot all the nobillest King Clariodus, The floure of knightheid, fearce and chevalrus, Inarmit schyning as ane angell cleir, Sik wounderis wroght that ferlie was to heir; From sum he straike the helme and sum the scheild, Sum men and hors he dryves doun in feild Throw his grit vigour and strenuitie, Quhilk was in deids of arms ane A per se, Might none him ather gainstand nor abid; Whairfor in feild thay maid him roum to ryd. Full long the justing induirit on this wayis, The Knightis all war nobill for to pryse, In all the feild was naine of them that fein?es; Full loud the heralds cryit thair anchein?eis Of all thir Lordis worthie and famous. Heraldis eik of King Clariodus, With voices cryit, Elu count a la bell! And he, that so in knightheid did excell, In feild that day hes conqueist sik renoune, That it was hard in everie regioun Of his victorious deidis triumphall, Whairthrow his honour did so far excell; Ower all the world quhile that he was on lyve His knightheid ran in grie superlative. This tornay duirit quhile the blisfull sun His course diurnall had compleitlie run, And did his purpur visage all scheroud In the occident under the noxiall clude, And quhill that Venus schew hir cristall light; Then from the feild they go for falt of sight. Ane moneth out did lest this [grit] tornay, That the Knights did him counter day be day; Bot King</field>
