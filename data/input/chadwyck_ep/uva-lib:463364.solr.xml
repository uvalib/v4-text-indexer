      <field name="fulltext">Priscus Grammaticus de Satyra. Satyra est carmen acerbum, instrum?tum mordax. &amp;c, A satyre, is a tarte and carpyng kynd of verse, An instrument to pynche the prankes of men, And for as muche as pynchynge instrumentes do perse, Yclept it was full well a Satyre then. A name of Arabique to it they gaue: For Satyre there, doothe signifye a glaue. Or Satyra, of Satyrus, the mossye rude, Unciuile god: for those that wyll them write With taunting gyrds &amp; glikes and gibes must vexe the lewde, Strayne curtesy: ne reck of mortall spyte. Shrouded in Mosse, not shrynkyng for a shower Deemyng of mosse as of a regall bower. Satyre of writhled waspyshe Saturne may be namde The Satyrist must be a wasper in moode, Testie and wrothe with vice and hers, to see bothe blamde But courteous and frendly to the good. As Saturne cuttes of tymes with equall sythe: So this man cuttes downe synne, to coy and blythe. Or Satyra of Satur thauthors must be full Of fostred arte, infarst in ballasde breste. To teach the worldlyngs wyt, whose witched braines are dull The worste wyll pardie hearken to the best. If that the Poet be not learnde in deede, Muche maye he chatte, but fewe wyll marke his reede. Lusill, (I wene) was parent of this nyppyng ryme: Next hudlyng Horace, braue in Satyres grace. Thy praysed Pamphlet (Persie) well detected cryme Syr Iuuenall deserues the latter place. The Satyrist loues Truthe, none more then he. An vtter foe to fraude in eache degree. [Q. HORACE FLACCUS HIS FYRSTE BOKE OF SATYRES.] [The fyrst Satyre.] THE POET SPEAKETH Reuerently to his patron Mæcenas, bytterly controlleth the vnconstancye of men, and their chaungeable affections, that none of them will contente him with his share: and herevpon taking occasion, he doeth bende a greate parte of his artillarye against the couetous: whose rauenous and vnsatiable doings, he doeth egerly deteste and abhorre. Right drad Mecenas whats the cause that none contente abyde In trayned trade, that whylome choyse or chaunce to them affyed? But loues, and lykes, an others lote, and nouell lyfe pursues. Still flotes and flyts, from former fate Ne brookes the same to vse. Thunwyldye warryer waste with toyle wyth grouelyng elde for spente, O makelesse marchaunte mumbleth he O state with blisse Yblent. The fearefull marchaunt he again, When waltring wyndes amayne With plunging puffes, from Sothren coste and hydiouse hissing rayne, Torments the Sea, hoistes vp the waues that doth surmounte the sayle, Saunce pere doth deme the souldyers guyse for why, they tugge, they hayle They prease in plumpes on mortall yron where eftesones eyther bayne Is prest: or gladsum trumpets clang dooth blase tryumphante gayne. The counsailer for Meede, or fee that parles, and pledes the lawes When at cockes crow, his gats are pushte with hastinge Clyentes pawes. Then happye farmer ofte sayth he for thou in golden sleepe Arte soust: of mout or suite vndreamde of barre thou beares no kepe. The chubbyshe gnof that toyles and moyles and delueth in the downe, If happlye he a suertie be, so sente for into towne: Who gapes, who gawes, who pores, who pries who proggs his mate but he? Perfaye (saith he), hers all things ryse, these people blessed be The resydue that rests vnroulde, the remnaunte that remayne, Of this new fanglde fickle flocke, woulde pose and put to paines Fable a common pratler.The fabling Fabies tatling toungue: to deskaunte and descriue The route, and rabble, all a rowe (a draughte to longe to dryue) But that no tracte neede trouble thee, nor ambage breede delaye, Harke well how I will coutche this gere, put case som god woulde saye Your lykings all, allowde shalbe, and thou that erste in feilde The maces keene, the grounded sworde, the Tucke, the targe, the sheilde, Was wunte to wilde, wyth passage moyst shall cutte the frothie playne, A merye marchaunte shalte thou row, and thou that didste disdayne To lyue and leade the Lawyers lyfe shalt mucker in the grounde. Be trudgging hence, your trades are turnde, why stande you still in stounde? They wyll not tho, although they mighte accepte this blisfulle boune. Then whats the cause that Ioue thus mockd may not condinglye soone In irefull mode, and dyre reuenge engourge his puffed cheekes Gaynste all this sorte? and spreed no eare to them that hensforth seekes And suies with pratlynge prayer to chop and chaunge their proued plighte. But leste som man shoulde houlde me in hande my tretys is to lyghte, To muche with laughter interlasde (albeit the gester may Harpe on a soothe, (ells God for byd) and toyes may kepe and staye Sumtimes the reeder veray well, as those that teache in schooles, With buttred bread, or featusse knacks will lewre the little fooles, To learne a pase theyr A. B. C. I will be at a poynte Wyth nyfles now. Ile turne the leafe and waightye thinges disiointe. The Churle that shreds the earth, with share, and wreakes the yeeldynge leas, The marryner that shaues the streame and furrouse vncouthe seas: The Tauerner that falsethe othes and litle reckes to lye, The souldyer that doth deale the battes and makes his foes to flye They say the cause they trauayle thus, that thus they care and carke Is this: That when vnnimble age hath refte them of their warke: When fumbling foote denyes to meeue when hande nil houlde or hente That then they might suffisaunce haue leste easles neede them shente. Not muche vnlyke the lytle ant (a beaste of tydye toyle) Who drawes and dragges her delycates orewharte the hillie soyle By myghte of mouth, in all she may and placed in her cell, She stickleth, and bestirres her selfe She huswyfes it right well. She carues it fyne, and mings it thicke and shroudes it vnder roofe As one, that of the wynters wrathe Were not to learne the proofe, Ne yet to care for after clappes. Whereby when Ianyuere That myrethe all the costs wyth slete and saddes the ginning yeare. With aspere shours dooth cause the cloudes and welken aye to wepe Then Ladye Pismyer stirrs no where shees claspde in closset deepe. Shee keepes her Chrystenmasse in caue and there they make bone cheare. They feede and feele the fruit of that, which once they gott yfeare: And wyselye to, but the (alas) not Phebus flaminge brande, Nor greuouse, mumming could that maks the chillyng sencelesse hande Nor fearefull fyer, that flusheth vp and fumes to pitchye smoke: Nor stormye seas whose oppen iawes suppes vp wythout all choke The straglinge shippes: nor weapon whet Nor oughte canne the deterre From huntynge after hurtfull horde for whilste som such there are That swimme in wealthe, and the surpasse in rytches or in robes, Thy glutton mynde will neuer staye still, still thy stomake crobbs. What vayles it the so quakinglye to grubbe and grip the moulde, And there in hucker mucker hyde thy Idalle God thy goulde? If that thou spende and sparple it no dodkin wyll abyde: The deuille may daunce in crosslesse purse when coyne hathe tooke his tyde. And if thou snudge, and saue it sounde and cofferte from the sonne What shewe then hathe thy hidden hepe what luste is therebye wonn? Admit on flore thou haste in store an hundreth thousande mets Of corne dehuskde: what cums thereby? thy belly houldes nor getts No more then myne: as if in case to feelde thou shouldeste fayre With scrippe on backe, fulle frayghte with foode and straighte as thou cums theire The hungrye hunts muste haue it all, what makes thou by this matche? As much as he that carryeth noughte (certes a woorthye catche.) Or els per frendship answer this, to him that doothe propounde Nature his guyde, and treads her steppes, what booteth him of grounde Whether an hundreth acres he or els a thousande tills: Thou saiste he feddes the eye the more, that from the huge hepe fills? Well syr no force, if that you will but condescende to this That our repaste doth ryot shun, and reasonable is To kepe the soule and Carcas cheynd to stynte the pyning stynge Of hungers gnaw, and that we haue a meane of euery thynge: Why th? what doste thou boste so much, thy plumes why doste thou spreade? What better is thy barnes, then our smale sackes that serue our neade? Muche lyke for southe, as if that thou a potte or pitcher muste With lykor lode, and mights it fille at fountayne hereby iuste, And yet for fonde affection, thou, to please thy gredye eye, Shouldste wende vnto the flowing streame where greater gulfes do flye. At whiche whilste som haue reached farre and proferde ouer faste, The b?cke hath burste, that down they lush, and so be drente at laste. But he that leanes to temperaunce, and anchoures on her lore, And takes so muche as serues his turne, and gapes to grype no more, Him needes not draw the drubbled dreggs of fawle by durtye poole, Nor yet for deuelishe thirste to haue (as one from vertues schoole Exempted quite) fetche from the brim and ouerwhelming waues, Where now and then (O iust rewarde) in raginge surge sum taues. The Cristalle springe shall woorke his will and syluer channelde wells Shall yeelde ynoughe, where lurcks no dreade, where slyme ne slabber dwells. But out (alas) the greater parte, with sweete empoysned bate Of welthe bewitchde do weeue their wants aboundaunce in eache state For monye maks and mars (say they and coyne it keepes the coyle It byndes the beare, it rules the roste it putts all things to foyle. A mannes his money and no more, wherin confused is An heauen of happs, a worlde of weeles, an hunnye bath of blisse. O dottrells dome, and is it so? what guardon for these doultes Shall we deuyse? lets suffer still the foolishe frantycke foultes To wallowe in their wilfulnes, whose vnder eating myndes Is neuer crainde, but prools for more and swarues not from their kyndes. Such one we reade of in olde tyme that dwelte in Athins towne A man in substance passinge rytche nathlesse a niggerde cloune, At whose scarceheade and couetyce the worlde did outas make, But all in vayne, he forcst it not he sought not howe to slake. Blacke fame, that frisked euerye wheare and bounsed at ytche eare, A figge for them (? brasen face) I force not howe I heare. They hauke, they hem, they hisse at me, I weygh it not an hawe, Whilste I may harbor in mine arke, and lodge wythin my lawe. My darlynge goulde, my leaneste gueste, my solace and my glee, He is the bone companion, its he that cheares vp me. Ah simple cheare consyderynge all, graue Tantale in thyn hearte, His fee dyd feede his fatalle falle, his mucke procured his smarte. Whose lippes as drye as any kykkes dothe ofte assay to taste, The licker, to allay the droughte that hathe nye, all to waste His intralls sterude for lacke of moyste, the fluds to be his paine They clim vnto his veray chinne and then declyne againe. He catcheth and he snatcheth aye, and stille he grates in teene, And stille shall do, for panges stille springe and freatinge sorowes grene. I pray the now what cause haste thou to sporte and pleasaunce take? To faune vppon thy foolishe goulde whiche endlesse greefe doth make. For thou induriste Tantalls fate, and takynge but his name, This tale maye well be toulde of the thou arte the veray same. Thy house, the hell, thy good the flood, which thoughe it doe not starte, Nor stirre from the, yet hath it so in houlde thy seruyle hearte, That though in foysonne fulle thou swimmes, and rattles in thy bagges, Yet toste thou arte with dreadefulle dreames, thy mynde it waues and wagges, And wisheth after greater things, and that, thats woorste of all, Thou sparest it, as an hollye thynge, and doste thy selfe in thralle Unto thy lowte, and cockescome lyke thou doste but fille thine eye With that, which shoulde thy porte preserue and hoyste thyne honor hye. Thou scannes it, and thou toots vpponte as thoughe it were a warke By practysde painters hande portrayde with shaddowes suttle darke. Is this the perfytte ende of coyne? be these the veray vayles That money hath, to serue thy syghte? fye fye thy wysedome fayles. Tharte misse insenste, thou canste not vste thou wotes not what to do Withall, by cates, bye breade bye drincke, in fyne disburse it so, That nature neede not moue her selfe, nor with abetments scant Distrainte, and prickd, passe forth her dayes in pyne and pinchinge want.

O Ioue betake, that I may be deuoyde of all those gooddes That brewes such banefull broyles, or brings of feare suche gastfull fluddes. But if so bene the pauling colde thy limmes dooth ouergo. Or els sum other worse disease hath daunte thy body so, That downe thou must, and byde in bed, thy vauntage then is great, At elbowe preste thou hast thy frendes who will prouide the meate.

Alas the whyle its no pointe so, thy wyfe she workes thy vayne, Thy sonne he inlye lothes thy lyfe, his regreate and his plainte Is euer freshe, because that death doth linger to attaynte Thy hatefull heade, thy neyghbours, and thy cheefe acquaintaunce all Thy iacke, thy gille, thy kith, thy kinne doth prosecute thy fall. What maruayle ist, when thou hast loude thy syluer as thy lorde, If none loue the, whose loutishe lyfe deserude no louinge worde? But if thou thinckes thy alyes to linke in frindshippe and in faythe, And wenste thou maiste with smale a do from breache and folishe wrathe Kepe tyde the knot that nature knit: Ah sillye manne, in vayne Thou doste surmise this fruitlesse fetche, its farre beyonte thy brayne: Perseueraunce in amitie, and duraunce still in loue Discordeth muche from fickle man, thou maiste as well aboue The sluggishe asse a saddle couche, with golde and perle befret, And strayne his iawes, with brydle braue with goldsmithrye ybet, And so to make him praunce, and plunge, to friske, and gamballs fetche, To chewe vppon the spewinge bit, and at his foes to retche, With harneste houfe: as thou canste learne the fraile retyryng man To treade in trace of trouthe outryghte in truth as he beganne. In fyne, suppresse thy lewde desyre: the more thou haste in store The lesse passe thou for pouertye, do trauaile for no more Sence thou accomplishde haste thy wille, and purchesde wealthe at ease: O be not lyke Vmidius, whose rauenouse disease.

I woulde the not a nipfarthinge, nor yet a niggarde haue, Wilte thou therefore, a drunkard be, a dingthrifte, and a knaue? There is a difference betwixte the gelded Eunuke Paue: And Herniosus, hote as coles that rancke vnclenly swaine. A meane there is in matters all, and certaine bondes be pyghte, On this syde or beyonde the whiche no thinge thats good canne lyghte.

But teenes if that his neyghbours goate a bygger bagge doth beare Then his, or yeeldes her mylke sum deale more flowyng and more cleare: Nor euer will compare him selfe vnto the greater sorte, Whose state is base, and bad as his, who lyues in meane apporte. But roues, and shoots at further marks, now him he doth contende To passe in coyne: now him again, and so there is no ende. For he that thincks to coate all men and all to ouergoe, In runnyng shall sum ritcher fynde who still will bid him hoe. Suche posters may be likened well vnto the carters oulde Of forayne worlde, on mounte Olimpe whose carts when they were roulde With gyrefull sway, by course swyfters, to winne the glistring branche. They ierted vp their horse with whippes, that forth they made them launche, With boysterouse noyse, lyke thunder clappes, they made the quaueryng soyle To dindle and to shake againe, in hope of lawrell spoyle. They neuer had respecte to those that once were caste behynde, But scourde to geue the reste the slip, wyth course as wyghte as wynde. Ryght semblablye, this carkynge kynde of men, doe neuer eye The route that they haue ouerrun in goodes but haste, and hye To retche the resydue and soe do ayme aboue theyr strengthe To pricke, and pearse those marks, and whyts that lye withoute their lengthe. Loe this is euen the veray grounde, this is the perfytte cause, That most mislyke them selues so muche, and can no season pause In blesfulnes: and this is it. why very selde we fynde A man so cloyed with the worlde as he that new hathe dynde Is with his meate, and that thers none which in their extreame dayes Will parte from lyfe, as full from feaste to goe theyr homewarde wayes.

The seconde Satyre. THE POET STIL BLAMETH ficklenes and vnstedfastnes as of those, whiche laborynge to sayle fro the yrcksom poole of auarice, do willyngly contende to make shipwracke by the infortunate waues of prodigalitye: he speaketh againste fashions: they are thoughte to be noorses of pryde, and follye.

Their cause of greafe is sone expressde: he was both free and francke, They hanged on him, his purse kepte them so croustye, and so crancke. But this man, cleane contrarye wyse. Couetous. teschue, and shun the name Of spendall, and of scatter good, and fearyng such lyke blame That doth ensue outragiouse spence, he will not geue nor lende One crosse of coyne, to clothe or feede his nedie naked frende. An other, if thou question him Prodigall. why that he doth deuoure His syre, and gransyres goodes, and turneth towne, and tower All into noughte, throughe greedynes and foule delyting throte: And why that he by gluttanye, and stomake raging hote Miscounsailed, doth make assayle of landes, and lordshippe wyde To bye such curiouse cates, as beste will done his gullet glyde: His answer is not farre to fetch, posthaste he will the saye, That he doth thus set cocke on hoope and lauishly outlay This mucke, &amp; drosse the worlde hath sent, because he woulde not seeme Lyke one of carlish abiecte minde, so vyle a thing testeme. That answer say the neuer thriftes, was geuen in the Cue, Well fare his hearte: the chuffes the same with deepe disprayse pursue. Fusidius, a landed man, a man whose fertyle feyldes, Whose medowes fayre, &amp; glebye groundes reuenues ample yeeldes: A man by art of vsarye, by guyle, and treachers trade, By fraude, and couin full of goods, is veray sore afrayd To spende amongste good companie, leaste on such prankes might springe A iauall, or a ruffins name, or sum such heynouse thinge. This Fulsidie, to fille his purse, and to enritch his store, What soeuer cums by vsers skylle, to get, and gender more, He lays it to the captaine heape, whereof it rose, and grew: He takes by yeare the fiftes of all, and so he bredeth new. And if a man through negligence, perhapps be caste behynde, At partyng he shall pay for that such fetches will he fynde. Heild go me lyke a craftye coulte, and listen euerye where, To vnderstande the names of those that late delyuered were From gouernment of masters sharpe, and ginnes to weare the weede, That onlye manhood doth beseme: there there, he sowes his feede. He mings deceite, he plyes the boxe, he strues me suche a trayne, That straighte he is with them to bringe, (God wotes) vnto their payne. Thunbrydled brutes, the younckers that are paste the cure and charge Of Tutors graue, lyke lustye laddes, do loue, to roue at large, To roiste, and reuell wyth the beste, in suits of silkes to flaunte: The harde headed fathers they denye such spences vaine to graunte: Then cums this foxe, this Fusidie, wyth money preste in hande, He byes before their fathers death their lyueloode, and their lande, Who hearynge such malingen wroughte doth not abrade, and crye, Uppon the greateste God of all, that flings the fates from hye? But they, the sillye fonded fooles, (suche be the youthfull braines) Do feaste him, for his louesom loue, and highly praise his paines Certes, a man shoulde scarse beleue, how much this louelye wighte, Whome others loue, doth loue him selfe, how he doth decke, and dighte His surlye corps in rytche aray, what table he doth kepe, Menedemus.Almoste as greate as did the snudge, whome Terence toulde to stepe, And syncke in sorowes, and in sobbes, for that he chaste his sonne To Asie, there to pyke his crums, which deed vnkynde ons donne: He brake vp house, put myse to grasse, him selfe fed nothing fyne, With colewortes, and such carters cates, ofte woulde the caytife dyne. But here, if sum precysly aske, what doth this processe meane? It is to shew, that whilste sum men take care to kepe them cleane, From blame, &amp; blotte of one grosse sinne, incontinente they are caughte, Intangled with the contrarye: lyke dullerdes neuer taughte. A new f?gled minion of that age. Malkin, to make him singuler, a fashion freshe hath founde, He swings and swoupes from streete to streete, with gowne that sweepes the grounde, And thincke you Malkin wants his mates? no fye, that were a misse, An other pleasaunte headed chylde, in no sauce lyketh this. To proue himselfe a pretye man, and quaynte in his deuyse, He maks his garmente to be shapde, not of so large a syse: For wote you what? he coortalls it, it hardlye hydes his rumpe, Rufillus, he is perfumde with muske Gorgomi, smelles oth pumpe.

Sum one, or other lode starre stille, and what that he doth vse, The resydue may not ne will, for fashion sake refuse. Fashions in all our gesterings, fashions, in our attyre, Which (as the wyse haue thoughte) do cum, and goe in circled gyre. Fashions, in nottynge of the heare, in parynge of the nayles, In Otho, and mustacho beardes, thus fashions neuer fayles. In thother sexe, who woulde rehearse their fashions, as they be, Myghte euen as well by augrisme tell, the grauell of the See. Those curiouse croustinge courtly dames, whose spangled vestures sheene, With stones and pearles, of pryde, and pryse, and emrades heauenlye greene, Doth geue the glimmeringe, gloriouse shewe, that feedes the gasers eyes, And dasles quyte the simple lokes, with leames, that from them flyes: The worlde perchaunce doth thincke them gay, and in a chiefe degree: They be no better creatures, then other people be: Noe outwarde thinge doth better vs, no not our noble kynde: Not pearles, or golde: but pearlesse giftes be praysed in Godlye mynde. All els is toyes, and all is vayne, and all when they haue tryde, Will once confesse these things to be, but nutriments of pryde. The third Satyre. HE REPREHENDETH those who be sharpe accusers of others vyces, and can be contente, either not to see, or dissemble their owne. He dispraiseth the Stoickes discipline, who thoughte, all sinnes to be a lyke, and equallye to be punished: merylye after his maner, he beginneth with the ministrel Tygill, and disaloweth of his mutabilitie of lyfe. It is a faulte, a common faulte, that all our minstrels vse: The more you seme to craue a songe, the more they will refuse. Requeste them not they neuer cease: righte so woulde Tygille fayre, A singer of Sardinia, thoughe Cesar shoulde not spare, For his, and for his fathers sake sum musyke to requyre. Yet woulde his humble suite ofte tymes cum shorte of his desyre. He myghte haue forsde him therunto: but Tygille, if it had Cumde in his braine, woulde of him selfe, take on, as he were mad. He, Bacchus ballets woulde recorde sumtymes the trible parte Sumtymes, the quauerynge deskantdure sumtymes, to vaunte his arte, A boysterouse basse he bounsed out, and iumbled on his stringes, No dram he had of constancy: so fickle in his things. Ofte tymes, he ran, as fled from foe oftetymes in solemne pace He woulde proceade, as thoughe he were in seruynge Iunos grace. Sumtymes, an hundreth wayting men, sumtymes he kepte but ten: Sumtymes he spoke of potentats, and on his honour then Was all his talke: sumtymes, let me one dishe well dighted haue, (Thus would he say), and one course gowne my corps from coulde to saue. To this good husbande, that coulde be with pittance smale content, If sum good frendly man, of hope ten hundred crownes had lent. Within fyue dayes, no groate he had, in purse, ne yet in cheste: All nighte he wakde, whilste morning came, all day he tooke his reste. Was neuer man so litle stayde. but sum, will say to me, And what are you, sum selye saincte? nay, halfe as ill as he: One Meuius, did frumpe and floute at Neuie, then awaye: A frende of his, a stander by, what serray what I say? (Quod he): doste thou not know thy selfe, nor thincke that we the knowe? Meuius.My selfe, yes, I wincke at my selfe: Po. Po therfore, a wincking dawe. This is, a wicked, witlesse, loue, not to be wincked at: Synce, thou doste know, and see thy sinne, and vse to wyncke at that: What meaneste thou, in others faults, so pearsantly to prye Epidaure taken for all kynde of serpents.With Egles syghte, or Epidaurs that suttle serpentes eye? But if in case, an other carpe sum cryme, he sees in thee, He is too rashe, and vndiscreete, and no good fellowe he. A sheepe, a verey gestynge stocke, he treades his shoe awrye, His gowne sitts slacke, his heade vnkempte, vnciuyle, by and by. But he his good, and godly to, and one that wills the well, And thoughe his bodye be not braue, greate witte may in him dwell. Well, ryfle thou thy conscience, and looke thou be not led With any vyce, which nature hath, or custome in the bred. In feildes vnforowde frute is none, for brakes all ouer growes: To blowe retreate, and to returne from whence my matter flowes: If we doe strongly loue a thing, and lyke verey muche, Thoughe faultes in it be euidente, Yet we will see none suche. I woulde, in race of amytye such dotage we might vse, And that vertue, by honeste name, such curtsye woulde excuse. For as the father for ill shape, his sonne doth not disdayne: So frendes, at times, must beare with frendes, though faultes in them remayne. The sonne he squynts, the father saythe Sysiphus. he hath a pincking eye, His legges misshapde, the father sayth, his legge but standes awrye. The parents pleasure much, to prayse, and prattle to the ladde, Thy foote is verey greate (sayth he) thy foote is swelde to badde. Haste thou, a frende, that dyets harde? Well, call him thriftye than: Haste thou, a frende, a bragging lout? call him a iollye man: The king of fellowes, amongste frendes, for hym no better name. Haste thou, a frende, with face of brasse, that bragges without all shame? Compte him, of stearne, and haughtye hearte, that, well dare speake his mynde: That will not flatter, nor yet feare, how soeuer blowes the wynde. If, he be suttle, call him sage, if wylye, call him wyse: This, this is it, that winnes thy frendes, and wun, in frendship tyes. But we, full ill construction, of vertue selfe, do make And eftsones, do eclipps the praise thats due for vertues sake. For, if wyth vs be conuersaunte sum humble, lowly soule We calle him goose, and disarde doulte, and fowlye fatted nowle. And, if a man deale warylye, and beare him selfe vppryghte, Amongste such folke, as fosher fraude, and practise slylye sleighte, For name of skilfull, wyttye man, and one that takes good heede He is a deepe dissemblyng man, and craftye for his meede. If, that a man can not conceale, but tell his verdicte free, (As I Mæcenas patrone myne) haue done full ofte to thee: If, that he speake to one thats whishte, or looketh on his booke, Or talke not all in printe or tune, (say we) this coddes heade, (looke) This asse, doth wante his comon sence. woes me, and oute, (alas) How doe we aggrauate such lawes, as gainste our selues doth passe? For, faultlesse (doubtles) borne is none, and he, is euen the beste, Whose, lyfe syncere admitteth fewe, and with the leaste is preste. A frindly man, (as meete it is) the good, with bad will wey, If much be bad, and more be good, let soulderde frendship stay. Let vs, in equall ballaunce paise, and do as we woulde haue: Wouldste thou thyne owne offences cloke? in others faultes not raue. It is but ryght, that mum, shoulde mum, and perdon, perdon craue. For shorte, in that, the vyce of wrathe will be our tenaunte still, And brutishe parte of moodie mynde, will lodge fections ill: Why do we not, by reasons rule, and by proportion iuste, Deme of the cryme, as it is done, and mulcte it as we muste? If, that the maister byd his man, from borde to take a dishe, The man, doth sipple vp the brothe, or feede on broken fishe: His maister, hangs him straighte vpponte: who will not houlde him mad As Labec? and why not thou Labio a lauishe toungued lo sel. who still was barkyng at Auguste. as frantyke, and as bad? Thy frende offendes, and graunts his guilt, thou, wilt him not forgeue, What arte thou then? a testye churle, greate pittye thou shouldste lyue. If thou him hate, and shun his syghte, (as Drusos detters doe) Thou shalte be dresde, lyke Drusos selfe, A creditours. he, for to lend to moe, Doth sheare, and shaue and powle, and presse, well, when his audit cums, When he most hopes of best recepte and to suruewe his sums. Then, gawlye wordes (for feare of strypes) (when he his coumpts hath red) He doth put vp, with cap, and knee, at those which from him fled. A good felow. Euander cums vnto my house, perhapps, he drincks to much, Or breaks a iugge, or staines my gowne, or, eats my dyat, suche, As was preparde, and plasde for me, is he, the lesse for this, A merry grigge, a iocande frende, for euery sillye misse? Shoulde I, go baull a maine at him, as he had pickte my purse, Or me discryde, his pledge denyed or done sum thinge, thats woorse? Who, almost hath at any tyme thoughte faltes of equall weyghte?

When man, abandon firste the earth, and scraulde out of the moulde, (A dum vnwyldye creature) through hunger, and through coulde, For foode, and harboure gan they fray: at firste, with tooth, and nayle, And then, with clubbes, and then with swords which vse, had taughte tassayle: Whilste wordes, ambasdors of the heart (for to bewray the mynde) Were put in vre: and names applyed, then, to conserue their kynde, They seaste from warres: made reare vp walles: and poundinge lawes did make, That none should filche, nor any robbe, that none shoulde wedlocke brake. For, or that cytyes had their walls, or, Helen, came to Troye, Haue women, bathde the worlde in blood, (the cause of dyre annoye) But, of the slayne was no recorde. they raunged, in eatche where, No spousailes knowne, more brute, then beastes, the make, knew not his feare. The mightieste man, lyke Bulle in herde, did wreake, the meaner sorte: Thus, graunte you must, that feare of wronge, set ladye lawe in forte. If, thou wilte calender in mynde, the consequents of tydes, By notinge, longe dyssente of tyme, in what effecte, it glydes: Well maiste thou see, that nature telth, What lyke, what leaue, we muste, Yet, nature, hath no pollycye, to seuer wronge, from iuste.

HE DEFENDETH HIMSELFE, againste those who had reported him to haue ben slaunderouse, sharpe, and corrosiue: He toucheth Lusilius not to condemne his doings, but to haue th? amended. He professeth to speake againste no man, vppon superfluitie or disease of the braine, but vpon a mere francknesse, &amp; libertye of the mynde: specially, he rebuketh them, which will kycke &amp; resiste when they should be cured. The Poet Aristophanes Eupolis, and Cratyne, And auncients moe, whose interludes, are sauste, with sayinges fyne, If any person were mislyude, in thefte, or leachers lore, Or were a roisting quareller, they woulde display him sore, Hence, Lusill boroud all his vaine, those presidents, he tooke The matter sharpe, the feete, but chaungde, the forme, full sleke, did looke.

Sum, kepe exchaunge, from Easte, to Weste, and sore vpon the Seas: Toste and retoste, (lyke wherlywynde duste) ekynge theyr owne disease, For mainteynaunce, of gotten stocke, or els to make it more. All these do stande in awe, of rymes, and hate the Poets sore. The Poets proyne, beware (say they) that they may ieste their fill, They spare no speache, they spare no frende fooles lauishe, and to ill. And if their toyes, in letters lymde be printed once in booke: Then all the worlde muste take the vewe and all sortes on them looke, If this be true: then harke againe, I am no Poet, I. No Poet, such as is discryude, am not I so? and why? Not he a Poet, that can make an haltinge hudlynge verse: Nor he in paltrye daylie talke that can his tale reherse. Him Poet dub, whose wit is sharpe, whose mynd doth mounte on hye Whose throat is shyrle in trumpet wyse, to coutche mennes acts in skye. Therfore demaunde hath once bene made, if comedies myghte be A poecye, sythence in them the spirit puffes not free. No gorgiouse sounde in worde or sence, saue that in verse it runs: From prose in differs but by foote, but (lo) the father burns In pelting chafe, for that his sonne on wantons madded is, And leaues a spouse of noble dowre this breedes a tempeste, this. And that with torche in twylightinge he treades the romye streets. How say you haue not comedies theyr vigors, and their spreets. Olde Pomponie, if he had lyude, Pomponius an impacient nygard. what stirre now woulde he keepe, (Thinge comicall because his sonne, is drente in debte so deepe? And what thoughe father Pomponie, should grate his gaule in twaine, Affection makes no poecye, but lustye, loftye vayne. Its not inough to pen a verse, in vernishde wordes and pure, Eche worde alone, muste haue his sounde, and seme not to demure. Those simple wordes, playmakers vse, those vse Lusille and I. So nyse, so neate, so numberouse, that alls not worthe a flye. Disorder but the glydinge gate, the wordes appeareth tame, No glose there is of maiestie, not such as in this same. Foule moodie Mars broke brasen bars, bare boulstred boulwarkes backe. These wordes transposde, yet eche one hath of Poesye a smacke: And thus much now an other tyme if rymes allowde may be. But now, why shoulde this kynde of style, be so suspecte in me. Promoters seeke, and pere eche where, and vse to woorke much woe, Accusynge and molestyng men, wheresoeuer they do goe. Feared, and muche addrad of theues, and losels loose of lyfe, Not fearde, of those that pilfer not, nor broche no brabling stryfe Birrus and Cellus, for all naughtie packes.Admit, thou warte a naughtie packe, as dyuers other be, I am not one that doth promote, why arte thou frayde of me? My verses geue no gase from walls, ne yet in tauernes flye, Not Tygille nor such alecunners my woorkes do ouerprye. I shew them but to veray frendes, and at their greate requeste: Not to eche hobb, nor euery where. sum be that thincke it beste, Their quaynte deuyses to proclame, in market fayre, and marte: To reade them graue, &amp; sounde them braue, and to vnfoulde their arte. Such pleasure, haue pryde practisers, who do it not to mende, Nor learne a decencie in thinges, for no such honest ende. A malliperte, a merchaunte I of mallyce (thou wilte say) I vse this talke: whence issude this, gainste me that thou doste lay? Or which of my companions hath this instilde to the? Who pincheth at his frende, not preste, or if he burdned be. Doth not alleuyate his blame, who scoffes to make men smyle, Who plyes for to be plausible, and doth his flowtinge file. Who can inuente things neuer mente, who nothynge can conceale: Such one is naughtes, beware of him, and naughte to him reueale. Sumtymes, at table thou shalte see, a dosen more or lesse, Eche seekynge eche, ortwharte the thums, with tauntes and tearmes to dresse. Their hoste they spare, for manner sake, till Bacchus tyde be vp: Then out muste all mine hoste, myne hoste is scande at euery cup. Rayling thou hates, yet doste thou coumpte raylers but mery men, Good felowes, francke and free of speache, If I haue iested then, A Rufills taste, Gorgonies smell, (two paragons of pryde) I am no freatinge ghoste therfore, nor slaundrouse: all things tryde. If chaunce we talke of Petills pranckes how he from tower stole, A massye peece of bullion golde, (to twyne thy tale in hole) Thou shapes it thus: (as is thy trade) Petille I know him well, I haue sum cause, to speake for him, for he and I did dwell Of childerne little, in one house, my fellow and my frende, Much hath he done, for me at tymes, I founde him euer kynde. And yet I maruayle how he coulde rub out this trespasse so. Logille a fishe whyte without &amp; blacke within.(Lo) here a craftye postles parte, loe here a Logille lo Ha, false malignaunte wreaking minde, this vyce I do expell, As cancre freate, from hearte and booke, moste true it is I tell, For certaintie I lyke it not, then lycence me the more, To gesse aloufe, not hard to scratche but clawe about the sore. My father, he did vsuallie, dehorte me from this sin, By manifolde examples, which, through talke, he woulde bringe in. Still warning me not to ingrate, nor seeke not much to lyue Olde Horace his talke. Albie and Barns Scatter gooddes.But thryftylie contentedly enioye that he would geue. Maiste thou not see younge Albie now how he is cumde to naughte, Backbyting Bar most beggerlike? Ingrayle them in thy thoughte. Two presidents, that thou ne shouldste, thy fathers good mispende, But when he woulde dehorte from loue, his talke was to this ende. Sectan wanton amourouse.Dissemblable to Sectans sorte, no brothelmonger be, So Trebon.Kepe wedlocke chaste, let Trebons name, be warninge vnto thee. The wyse men with their moralls sage, by reason coulde the guide, Suffyseth me that I can geue, such counsayle as I tryde. And if my sawes, in time take place, for teacher haste thou none, When groweth, and yeares shall make the man, youthes shipwracke, will be gone. Thus woulde he turne my plyant youth, and what he wilde in worde, For patterne, he woulde bid me marke, the lyfe of sum good Lorde. So, if he woulde inhibit me, this is no godly deede My sonne (sayth he): and here vppon, sum foule reporte will breede. For euen like, as when neighbours dye, the sickmans chaunging luste, For feare doth stay, and is contente, to cum to dyet iuste: So skillesse youth to see defame, of others, may take heede, And slip not into vyces snare, nor listen to her reede. Hereby I stayed my tempting age, and did no haynouse sin In easye crymes, and veniall I haue bene trapped in. And these, (no doubte) wil wayne awaye and ebb as they did ryse, By helpe of yeares, by frendes reproofe, and by myne owne aduyce. As I lye in my bed sumtymes, on matters thus I muse, Thrifte, would do thus, righte doth diswade, that I shoulde thus me vse. Thus coulde I make my chearfull frendes: this was a foolishe parte: Was I so fondlye ouerseene? a foole sone flings his darte Thus do I mutter in my mynde, Ere whyle at cardes I play, (A faulte, amongste the meaner faultes) forgeue me. Thou saieste nay. Then Poets all, preas on, preas on helpe at a pinche: no dreede, We be so ryotouse a route, who sayes but we shall speede? The multitude can not be led fr? their fancies, no not for truthes sake.As Iewes do measure all by myghte, that none dare them forsake: So we by number will men force. in league with vs to take. THE FIFTE SATIRE, whiche the Poet had written of his iorneying to and fro, wholye altered by the translator. Frende Horace thoughe you maye me vse as to translate your verse, Yet your exployte I do refues, at this tyme to reherse. Not euery tricke, nor euery toye, that floweth from your braine, Are incident into my pen, nor worthie of my paine. (If all be true that sum surmyse) for dyuers thincke it good, To haue discriude the clatteringe broyles, of Mauors raging wood: Or for to know the climats hye, to clym vnto the skyes: To view the starres, their placing eeke and how they set and ryse. Or for to reade the quiddityes and queerks of logique darke, To heare the babblinge sophisters, how they for naughte can barke. Or for to wryte things naturall, thinges misticall and geason: The harmonie of elements how they accorde by reason. To sterte vp in astrologie the casuals of men To limit, and forlote by arte, to shew by whom and when, Thinges were conueyde: and to erecte through what aspecte and why, Pompey abroad, Cesar at home, were fortuned to dye. To tell how man a creature, of reasonable mynde Is sociable, apte, and fitt, to companie by kynde. To read the sacred histories, of man how he began: How firste he fell, through whome he fell, what of him selfe he can. To learne the helpes of holye tongue the doctors to peruse: To course the schoolmen, as they lye and Horace to refuse. Those cacklinge pyes, that vse to prate, so much againste humanytye, Are commonly the lewdest dawes, and skillesse in diuinitie. The antique fathers vsde it much, thapostle doth the same: Now all muste downe, in pullinge downe that fooles may get a name. Som innouation must be made or chaunge of vsed things, Needes muste there be: when all woulde passe and all woulde needes be kynges. Moyses in writinge his fyue bookes confearde with prophane tyme Yet fewe or none, that I haue harde, appeached him of cryme. From Egipte, we may borow stil, it neuer was forbod, So it be for the weale of man and glory of our God. To reade sole scriptures, is I graunte a thinge of lesser paynes, And those that fayne woulde haue it so woulde haue it so for gaines: Unable for to get of toungues or scyences a skyll Then crye they soule diuinitye, as though the rest were ill. Diuinitie is gloriouse and they but idle praters Gainste whose outrage, a man mighte well wryte forty godlye Satyres. The wyse can reade humanitye and beautifye their witte, whileste fooles syt tatlyng to and fro in talkinge againste it. A good diuyne mighte the translate (Horace) I can it proue: Who so denyes, I do not doubte to caste him downe my gloue. And yet suche is the matter now whereon thou doste indyte, That I must play the Poet needes, and wots not what to wryte. Thy lawrell greene betake to me, thy gowne of scarlet reade, And proue a nouice howe I can in after steppes I treade. Feigne me to haue a Poets arte, a natyue Poets brayne: A veray Poete, sauyng that I vse not for to fayne. Dames of Pernas, of Helicon, whence Pegas horse dyd flye: (If yours it be) graunt this to me, in processe not to lye. Nay, thou O truthe, bothe God and man, of whome I stande in awe: Rule ore my wordes, that I ne passe the compasse of thy lawe. What shoulde I wryte gaynst wickednes howe synne hath all the hyre: Howe wyghtes are wed to wretchednes, captiues to theyr desrye? The Prophets haue bewayled that, and he whose voyce so shryll: Both heauen and earth with plaintife tune, and dolours deepe dyd fyll. The truthe hymselfe when he was here, dyd truely thyngs foretell: And wepte to see the sory plagues, that afterwarde befell. If they moude fewe, yf fewe woulde marke the wordes of suche lyke men: Howe may the silly Satyrists, hope for amendment then. In vayne for me to styrre or kepe a racket wyth my rymes: The sonnes of men, wyll styll be men and plyaunt to the tymes. What shoulde I wryte gaynst wyckednesse? the worlde by her aduyce, Hath broughte to passe, that moste beleue, there is no kynde of vice. For couetyse is coloured, and though the Prophete kyng Damne vsurers, yet styll we see more practise of the thyng. Dame Gluttony is too to hye: she keepes in stately halls, And gurmundyse is fellowshyp, for so the worlde it calls. So luste is nowe a lordly thyng, and swearyng hath a grace, Forswearynge couerde vnder zeale, (alas) the cursed case. What shoulde one write, dissemblyng dawes (a wondrous tale to tell) The better birdes of noble price, by creakyng woulde expell. The Popishe dawes, whom all men knowes, To be styll blacke of hue: Doo sweare them selues best protestants, and byrdes thats onely true. What shoulde I write? by colour all true tytles they doo steale, And couer thousande trecheries, vnder pretensed zeale. To knowe the matter perfectly, to vnderstande it well: Marke here what precise Commodus, to Pertinax doothe tell. Thynke Commodus to be such one, as couertly in herte, Doothe worshyp all Idolatrie, and myndes not to conuerte. And yet through shewe of godly zeale, oure churche woulde quite deface, To helpe the popyshe kyngdome vp, and to reteyne his place. Thynke Pertinax a peuyshe impe, an impe of popyshe lyne. Who styll wyll be a Catholike, (though all the bookes) diuine, Doo proue hys churche an heretike.) Sir Commodus kepes styll In Englande for commoditie: Syr Pertinax he wyll To Louayne, to the mother churche, but howe they bothe haue sped, Perceaue that by theyr proper talkes, and what lyues they haue led. The hunger waxeth sharpe and kene, in Flemmyshe bareyn lande, And Pertinax bet home with pyne, takes Commodus by the hande. Pertinax. God saue you gentyll Commodus, howe haue you fared longe? Commodus. Na, veryly euen as you see, well lykyng, fatte, and strong, Of credite neuer better I: what vrgent cause doothe make You at this tyme from sacred soyle, your iourney for to take? Pertinax. When we went to the holy towne, from Englyshe flocke infecte, Our want was wealthe, and coyne at wyll, we were an happye secte. But our long staye, was oure decaye, men grudgde to geue vs more: And Sarum with hys subtile booke, hath cropte our credite sore. Before, we gaue a countenaunce, to all the worlde so wyde: That our intent was wholly bent, to haue our quarell tryde. Suche cautels had we to beare of, that who gainst vs dyd wryte, We swore he was falne from the Churche, of gyddynesse or spyte. We bare them down that they wer nought, rashe, raylyng, and yll spoken, Lewde, and vnlearnde, but nowe our stythe of forgery is broken. Sarum hath walkde so waryly, (it greuthe me to name hym) That moste of men doo see his truthe, we wote not why to blame hym. Nowe they dispaire oure prostrate cause, and of our safe retourne: And suffer vs in beggery, (Ah silly case) to mourne. Commodus. Ah silly case, nay silly fooles, you myght haue lyued here, In wealth and blisse, and euen as there, haue kepte your conscience clere. Pertinax. In deede your letter writ to me, dyd signifye no lesse: But howe that you can vse it so, I woulde you shoulde espresse. Synce I came laste into the realme, it was toulde me of trouthe, That you aboue the rest of men, vse to be freattynge wrothe With ceremonies, is it so? Iesu, what shoulde one hope? They say that you doo caste them of, as brought in by the Pope. Can you speake so precisely here: and beare vs so in hande? You are no doubte no Catholike as now the case doth stande. Commo. No Catholyke: Ah Pertinax thou arte a mery man. I speake, I graunte against the pope and speake the worste I can. And profitte him yet more then you. (perhappes ye gin to muse) But harke to me and listen well what practise I doe vse. When you did cut the salte sea fome, with framed timbre borde, And yeade to Louaine there to heare, the Latine Romishe worde, Then stormynge in my thoughtfull breste, and sharpe beset with cares, In mortall waues I wandred still, in maze of my affayres. Feare caste in all extremities what shoulde I do thoughte I? To sanctuarie of papistes to Louaine shoulde I flye? That were a way to begger me to bringe me vnto neede: And in so doinge, I shoulde woorke, the mother churche smalle meede. Aeneas came into my mynde, that feynde him selfe a greeke, And by that meanes made manye soules, Lorde Dytis hall to seeke. He can not hurte his foe the moste that kepes the furste away: I was resolude to keepe me close, and see a furder stay. I sayde my wounded conscience did prickle more and more, And wyshed after some of skyll to remedye my sore. I sayde my doubte was dangerous, and therfore fayne woulde haue Some clarkly man of eyensyght deepe, within the same to raue. Thys was the tenour of my tale, that I woulde common fayne, If some learnde man on thother syde, woulde take on hym the payne. The Protestants be mercyfull, and glad to wyn vs all: In brefe the chiefe woulde me at length to common with them call. Theyr reasonyng was to and fro, to wyn me yf they coulde: And I began as debonayre, to render vp the houlde. Nowe hearken (oulde frende Pertinax) what was the spedy key: To ope the locke of credits forte, for me to beare a swey. He that was counted too to fearse and angry wyth the Pope, I went to hym, and prayde hym ofte my conscience for to grope. Parted from hym, I woulde proteste, and openly woulde saye: That suche one was the greatest clarke that was on lyue thys daye. He that was holden moste of zeale, and to the worlde the best: Hym woulde I prayse aboue the sonne, and so I purchast reste. No more demaunde made of my faythe. I faynde me very ielous: Of other men, and sayde they were drawebackes, and nothyng zealous. And styll I praysde my confessours, and made them so to swell, Suche pulpit hornetts by my meanes, That none durste with them mell. And what that they to feede theyr mynde, Or coloure ells woulde speake: I mayntaynde it with toothe and nayle, in all that I coulde creake. Then was I dubde as true precise, and faithfull by and by, And none was compted hoate enough, saue he and he and I. I whysperde to and fro a pace, and playde my parte so free: That quarells, stept vp faste and faste, A noble game to see. And that the reste myght learne to stoupe, and I myght growe vp styll: An other fetche by peecemeale, I into them dydde instyll. My maysters lysten well (quod I) take kepe what I shall saye. Me thynks this church; this englishe churche, is clogged at this daye, With ceremonies more then nedes, to tell you at a worde, I would haue all thyngs iuste as they were left vs by the Lorde. This knewe I was the deyntye dyshe, that so theyr passions fed: I am not nowe to learne I trowe, to bryng a babe to bed. Nowe, whether for true conscience, or els that they myght seeme Sole gospellers, and that the worlde, mighte so of them esteme: Or els through our suggestions, they gnawed so this bone, That O good God, I woulde to God they had bene let alone. Nay truste me truly Pertinax men woulde haue bene ful fayne, To thruste out all those gospellers, and sende for you againe. How say you, was not this a drifte, and that a drifte of hope? Am I not nowe, as lege as you, to our good lord the pope? If there were talke of gospels grace, of francknesse of our lybertie, Then woulde I whet my tongue to speake, againste the gifte of pollycie. And that our seruice was consumde, onlye in adoration: Wheras the pryme church, vsde one prayer, the reste in exhortation. That ministers, why shoulde they not? mighte goe euen lyke the reste In suits of silke, in cheynes of golde, apparelde with the beste. That ministers mighte take and leaue their orders when they woulde: I wente about to make all naughte by all the meanes I coulde. This was my greateste anchoure hold, I euer caste it thus: The worse it fared with their churche, the better much for vs. Untowarde case, vnluckye case Ah Pertinax I say (As erst I sayde) a trumpe a trumpe, was caste downe in our waye. And he that caste it, hath surueyde, and markde our cardes so well, That all oure driftes is nowe fordone, and you abrode muste dwell. As for my selfe, who but my selfe I neuer felte lyke ease: Not stoutest of the protestants dare me in ought displease. I made my matche I trowe with suche, as dare not but vpbeare me: What yf I knowe their giltie prankes and therevppon they feare me? Those wryng and wreste the meaner sorte, whose myndes and tongues are free, And so imbecill all theyr strengthe, that they are naught to me. I nowe can dubbe a protestant, and eke disdubbe agayne: And make a Papiste graduate, if he wyll quite my payne. Liuinges are myne, geuynges are myne, the countenance is myne: Promotions come to me alone, or where I will assygne. Yea Pertinax if thou wilte come, of Laberinth ne dreede. I can conducte thee safe and sounde, by vertue of a threede. I knowe who plaies the catte, and howe her ioly krttles mouses, I and my patrons leaue small lore, in some right famous houses. And if there be not speedie healpe. against me and my fooles. Ile driue their Gospell from the churche, and learnyng from the Schooles. In deede I studye harde my selfe, but to what ende or why? That I myght gette the greatest fee, and put all others by. As nowe I am, I coulde not wyshe almoste a better staye: If the precyse crepe vp agayne, I knowe my wonted playe. In the meane tyme I tell them playne they are the greatest clarkes, And that for theyr greate constancie, the totall worlde them markes. Yea I can tell them clawyngly (but that is in their eare.) That those whiche haue deposde them thus, are persecuters cleare. And if that some by pollicie, in tyme doo not preuent them, Ile egge them on to speake some thyng, whiche spoken may repent them. Well yf that those get vp agayne, I kepe my iolly stay: And if sir Pertinax you come, I wyll not go away. So that come papist, or precyse, or formall conformable, The precisde Papist kepes his roume, lyke promontorie stable. And yet, yf thou as palpable, my conscience couldst grope, Shaklockes profession.Of honestie, I am full true, vnto my lorde the Pope. May happs when I haue filde my purse, with takyng all this payne. I wyll go turne from Commodus to Pertinax agayne. Pertinax. What Commodus thou turnes they selfe as one shoulde turne the groate Turne rounde, or else thou will be spyde in turninge ofte thy coate. Becawse, you talked of gropinge erste, howe chauncde it heretofore, That you agaynst the blessed pope, so solemnlye haue swore. Speake oute man, are you in a dumpe? howe durssst you so farre go? Commodus. Iuraui lingua, sed mentem non iuratam gero. I tould them then, I spoke with tongue, but neuer mente it so. Pertinax. Why do you heare their seruice still, a thing of such abusion? Commodus. I could not els abyde with them, to helpe them to confusion. Pertinax. What say you to the precyse stocke, are they resolude that waye? Commodus. Sum parte of them is lyke my selfe, the conformable say That halfe of those whiche busylye against those orders clatter, Are Papistes ranke: as those may see whiche wyll suruey the matter. Pertinax. Why doo they make so straite accompt of thynges that bee but meane? Commodus. Pythagoras, why dyd he put mans soule within a beane? Pertinax. What if your selfe for not wearyng hereafter may be wrounge? Commodus. Tushe man I made them longe ago, a verey Aesops tongue. Pertinax. Synce you agaynst these churchly rites so longe and sore dyd wynche, Howe coulde you nowe resume agayne so bucksome at a pynche? Commadus. A sayde (as ofte I vse to say) that I was very poore, Nathlesse woulde geue tone halfe I had that I myght weare no more. Pertinax. I go to healpe a papist nowe, that ginnes for to recant, Commodus. And I go nowe, for to moleste a silly protestant. O noble force of flattery, Farewell olde fellowe myne, But so farewell that you kepe close and come to me to dyne. Translatour. Farewell a payre of hellyshe impes of cankred Sathans race: For you are enmies vnto God, And his in euery place. The true precise, none doo despise, but all men knowe it well, That they in learnynge and good lyfe, moste commonly excell. Not one of vs, but wylls them well to keepe their godly name. Nor euer thought to preiudice, or to eclips the same. Some be so wyse by Papistes guile, they can not be abusde: Yet Commodus hath fonded some, it can not be excusde. If I shoulde wryte of Commodus the craftes of suche lyke men, The tricklynge teares for hearty griefe woulde ouerlode my pen. But none wyll looke to Commodus, he beares the bell awaye, Some guardon due for his deserte, The Lorde wyll sende one day. The worlde is blearde with duskyng shoes, and daselde with a glose: But I appeale vnto the wyse, and craue redresse of those. Come what can come, howe muche can come, I am at staye in mynde: Theyr net of zeale, wherwith they steale, for euer to vnwynde. Since God and our liege Soueraigne bulwarkes to Truthe doo stande: We feare not Commodus his crafte, nor Pertinax his hande. The sixte Satyre. THE POET REBVKETH those which do c?mend vices in the nobilitie, and do iudge such worthie to bear rule, as also those whiche thinke, that none base borne oughte to haue any accesse to promotion. He speaketh to Mecenas, and commendeth hym as one whiche hath respect onely to vertue and godly qualities. Not due discent from haughtie house, nor thyne Hetrurie lande, (Myne owne good Lord) dothe cause thy name, and honour styll to stande. Not fathers syre, not mothers syre to cheuetant in fielde: (About whose banners suche a route of lustye bloods bare shielde.) Induce thee to be insolent, (as moste of gentrie be) To make a mocke of meaner men, for thou acceptest me. Whose mother was infranchised, and sayste, it dothe not skyll Of petigree, so that oure owne demeanour be not yll. Tullus as suppressor of vertue.Of this full well thou arte resolude before kyng Tullie gan So tyrannous a monarchie imbecelyng freedome than By vertues spray, the basest borne myght be the noblest man. Leuynus agreate gentleman hated of the people for his naughtynes notwithstandinge the great admyration they haue to gentry.Leuinus, he whose ancestours kyng Tarquine droue away: Through lyfe corrupt, and rainlesse youth dyd worke his fames decay. Neglected of the commoners, who onely doo admyre, Nobilitie, and none but them to honors would aspyre. If it be so that lawlesse prankes Yea nobles, discommendeth: Who will prayse vs of baser blood except our lyfe amendeth? For what if Leuyn were estemde and Decie were not so? Decius base borne.Leuyn a lowte, and Decie stoute, Yet Leuins kyndred tho, Myght be induction to the rude, to deeme of hym so well. Appius.If that the counsayles President, perchaunce should me expell, From Senate house, for vulgar stocke, This colour woulde he make, That base must byde in baser roume for ciuile profites sake. But glitterynge glorie rauysheth the poore and princely state: And pleasurs not aiote at lengthe: lette Tullie spell his fate. He myght haue past, hys tyme in peace declinyng lordly lyfe, His royall robes rasde rancour vp, and rancoure termelesse stryfe. Suche is the worlde, who beares the swey assuredly is scande, Howe he came vp, what parentage, what was his fathers lande. For, as the yonger that would seme moste hansome and moste braue, Dothe make the mo to marke the more if he suche features haue: So, who so thinks to rule in realmes, and aufull swey to beare, To place, displace, to dubbe disdubbe, to kepe the costes in feare: The riflyng of his petigree, muste thynke erewhyle to heare. Durste thou (say they) a beggers brat, in suche outtakyng rage, Take on thee thus, to heade the peare, to hang and drawe the page? Nouie, woulde be a counsayler Nouie a pety robber Paulus et Massala, in lawe I passe hym farre. Though not lyke some of fyled tongue to parle a case at barre, But, he can sett a face of it, with his forpenned tayle, In solemne syghtes, he thunders so, that fauters neuer fayle. Lette me speake well, speake what I can, They laugh me styll to scorne: He is to base to rule saye they, in deede to basely borne. Nowe grudge they me, because I am becomde your houshold guest: Before, because in warre and fielde my rule was nexte the beste. Thyngs muche vnlyke: for be it so, that honours enuyde be, As fortunes gyftes, yet maye I well be suppliaunt to the: Whiche art by choyce of ponderyng witte, of frendes prouided (lo) Not roumerakers, nor rente rackers, nor staynde with vices mo. I dare not saye that fortune coulde haue wrought me suche a blisse, Not loreles chaunce, but Uirgils lore, dyd helpe me vp to this. Fyrst Uirgils voyce, then Uaries prayse, your presence dyd procure: At myne income, I lowted lawe, And muttred full demure. For bashefull shame dyd styll my voice and muche abridge my talke: Therfore in blasing of my bloode, my tongue it dothe not walke. Nor howe that I doo mount on mule, in countrey gawyshe games: I platly power out my mynde, thou answere also frames. In briefe and fewe, suche is thy wont and after certayne dayes: Thou calls me home, and calls my frende, and this my griefe alayes. A ioy, to haue Mecene my frende, who good from bad dothe parte, Not by dissente, but lyfe well led, and ballaste breast with arte. For if with slender single sinnes and those but very few, My vpright nature be infecte, (as if in cumlye hue A warte or twayne be euidente) it is not muche to rue. If gamegroper or muckmunger, I can not proue it be, Nor spente my youth in daliaunce, the case is well with me. And be in charitable lyfe, withall and euery frende: I thancke my father for this gere, he sente me to this ende. Flauius.He sente me not to lawyers shop: to learne accoumpte to caste, To be recorder, auditor, to know to fetche in faste. Nor as the gentles sende their sonnes, to chatter in a plea, Professing law, learne lawlesse lyfe, and sayle in reade Sea. But lyke the babes of noble birthe, to Rome I was conducted With lordly artes, that might be seene, the beste I was instructed. My garments suche, retynue suche that most men did beleue, My gransyres goodds, did stay the route, that hangde vppon my sleue. My maister graue, well studied, and much vnlyke a sorte, Who dissolute at eche smale suite, do let their youth go sporte. For few, (as tip of all good name) he taughte me shamfastnes, That shendful shame through worde or fact did neuer me oppresse Not fearing, though I wente to lawe, on him I shoulde complaine, Nor doe: I can him hartye thancke, and praise him, for his paine. Except I mad, I may be glad, eke, of my parente base, And do milyke such kynd of skuse which sum vse in this case. Pardie (say they) not our faulte is, our parage is so meane: Pardye, say I, my voyce and heart doth go against that cleane. For, if that nature woulde and coulde reclayme my dulcet dayes, And bid me picke my parents out, mongst those, that beares the swayes, Sum would no doubte bid me take one, that liftes the loftye mace, And praunceth in the purple throne, contented with my place. I woulde not chaunge: the moste of men, wil thincke me straughte of witte, But you, can wey the waightie state, and iudge a ryghte of it. For, as auctoritie is greate, so substaunce must be greate My viaundes greate my charges greate, my frendes I muste, intreate, Som, one, or other, must I haue where so that I be gone, To towne or countrye farre or neare, a shame to be alone. My many muche, my traine of men, my geldings fatte and fayre, My waggons, coches, horselitters, for coste I muste not spare. In cytie, I must set vppon my golde bespangled mule, In deeper way, a trounsinge steede, whome vneth ought can rule. Els sum will checke me for my thryfte, Lorde Tullus so woulde thriue, Who Pretor woulde ride through the streetes, his trayne no more but fyue. Fyue peltinge laddes, (good senator) at least must wayte on the, And I may rome my mastership, wheresoeuer lyketh me. My selfe alone can chepen things, and make my market well, At euen and morne in fayre or marte from thence to where I dwell: So suche pore cates, as I well lyke, my supper reddie set, A pot of drinke, a glasse of oyle my housholde stuffe not greate. From that to bed not crampte with care, of that whiche may betyde, Nor bente to go a pilgremage, for my greate stryfe or pryde. I ryse at ease walke forth at ease, Nouis and then a caste at booke, All secretly, (a ioy of ioyes at it to syt and loke) For weryed with my bookishe gase, I noynte with supple oyle, My loytrous limmes, and when sir Phebe with brande beginnes to broyle: I washe my corps in cooly shade., my dyat smale and thin, Of pretie pittuance, not so muche, as stomacke woulde let in. I calculate the coursinge starres, how eche doth run, and rayne, When noysom dogge doth flame in rage, I cum not at the bayne, But sytt at home: this is the lyfe, so iollye, and so free, That cherisheth, and cheareth vp, and so recumforts me. As though my father grandfather, and vncle erste had bene, Lordes treasurers, and lefte me knighte, and ryche in chyldhood grene. The seuenth Satyre. A DERISION OF CHIDING and brawling. The stryfe is betwixte Rupilius king of Pryneste, and one Persius: a wonderful vndecente thing, for a noble man to be a scoulder. The fellone tongue of Rupilie, that traytor mungrill king, How Persius hath dreste in kynde, it is no nouell thing. As common as the carts way that. This Persie for the moste, Did make his bode at Ginnia: with Rupilie at hoste. With gybes, and glickes, and taunting stryfe a brawler sharpe and sore Rashe, arrogante, and by vse had of ribaldrye suche store: That from a dosen cacklinge drabbes, the bell he mighte haue bore Well, to the kinge, lyke dogge, and catte, these two did then agree, Lyke champions fell, their toylesum tongues they vsde as weapons free. For eche man seekes to noy his foe, (the olde sayde saw doth tell, With prowes, and those martiall feats, wherein he doth excell. Twixte Priams hautie Hector, and corragiouse Achill, So keene and mortall was their wrathe, that he did Hector kyll. And for no other cause I trow, but that, in those same twayne, Lyke force in principallitie, and parfytnesse did raine. Dasterds will quickly parte them selues, vnequall if they be, (As Glaucus was to Diomede) the weaker shrinketh, he Departs in peace, as recreante, his ransom maks him free. Lorde Brutus was lyeutenaunte, then of Asia the lesse, When Rupilie, and Persius, to combat do addresse. Lyke as two masters of the fence, vnshathe their blades of mighte, So, these same two, tongue puisaunte knyghts, with scoulding, ginn the fyghte, The auditorye numberouse, the Persye onset gaue, The people laugh, he praiseth Brute, and his retenue braue. Duke Brute, the sonne of Asia, his men, he cals the starres, Balde Rupilie, he rattles vp, to combat, if he darres. He calde him hurtefull hatefull dogge, to earthe, a greeuouse sine, Flowte.Lyke pleasaunte streame beset with woode, so flowes his talke diuine. Then Rupilie let issue out, his well ycouched wordes, Through seasonde, as the drubled lakes, that keepeth aye in fordes. So perfyt and exacte a scoulde, that women mighte geue place, Whose tatling tongues, had won a wispe, to stande before theyr face. The Persie see, his foe so fell, A raylers t?g insupportable, therefore not to be aunswered by wordes, but repressed by rigor of the maiestrate.and how he did him snape, Thoughte impossible to resiste, ne wiste he how to scape. Lorde Brute (quod he) my liege lord Brute, for all the gods aboue, Thou, that arte wonte to hasserd all, to win, thy countryes loue, To wringe the maces forth their handes, to daunte the dukes a downe, Be wrekde, be wrekde (thy onely prayse) vpon this doggishe clowne. The eyght Satyre. THE GARDINGE GOD Priapus beinge erected as a watche to driue awaye byrdes and theues, complaineth hym selfe to be sore scarred of the olde witche Canadie, her fellowe sorcerers Sagana, and such lyke. He partlye toucheth the maner of their practisynge. I was sumtimes a very blocke, the bodye of a tree, The wryghte vncertaine what to make, a stoole or God of me, His pleasure was to make me God, mine office is to fray, Both birdes and theues that wolde cum filtche our fruite from hence awaye. As images (most commonly) the woorkemen vse to make, To purchase ease or wealthe to men, and for their lucre sake. This orcharde was a sepulchre indeede, a publique graue, For Nomentane and Pantoble, and euerye rascall slaue. The plat of grounde, was brode and square, and of a mightie lengthe, Sum tombes there were righte beautifull, and of a during strengthe. This place that was a dampishe soyle, and whyte, with dead mens bones, Is now a pleasaunte paradise, to walke in for the nones. The veluet grasse, the holsom herbes, the trees, in motley lyuerie, Both arte and nature haue bestowde, abundantlye their tapestrye. I am molested very muche with fowles, and cleekynge theues, Yet moste these charmynge sorcerers, vndoubtedly me greues. Who doe with poyson, and with spells, bereue men of their witts I can not stay these mother mabbes, but they will charme by fyttes. When as the moone beginnes to shew her younge and cumlye face, They cum to gather, deade mens bones, and hurtefull herbes a pace. Canadie a witche,I saw my selfe olde Canadie, about twelue of the clocke, Bare foote, hyr lockes about her heade, Ytuckde in pukishe frocke. She howled with an other hagge, a color sallow wan Made them to looke, lyke gastefull goosts, (good for to curse and ban) These two with teeth, did rente in twaine a lambe of blackithe hue The blood resorted to an hole, purple, and smoking new. Thence did they scyte, the damned soules, from Plutos pallace large: The soules, that al things should expounde, as it was geuen in charge. Stode statues two, the greate of wull, of wax was made the lesse, The greater gurnde with visage grim, as thoughe he woulde oppresse The lesse which lowred lowtishlye, dispairinge all redresse. The one she calde of Heccatye, Kinge Plutos chamber feare, The other calde Tisephonie, that hath in spite no peare, Fyndes, serpentes, furyes, hellish impes. the moone inflamde to reade, Thou mightes haue seene, the witches couch behynde the tombes of deade. For beinge spyde, If that I lye, the dawes defyle my noule, And all the theues of Rome cum in, and of my fruite take toule. What shoulde I shew particulers? by course how they did speake, The witche and goosts how they did houle, againe how they did squeake, How they enterred in the grounde, a speakled serpentes hyde: And hare of woolfes, and by and by, a flame there out did glyde. And as the flame did grow in bulke, and gan for to increase: So did the waxen image (lo.) by smale and smale decrease. I markte the drabbishe sorcerers and harde their dismall spell The matter, went so harde with me, (there was no other boote) I let a scape? Dame Cannadie she moude her aged foote, And trotteth on her way so harde, that all her teethe out fall: The other trot loste her read hyue, she hid her bushe with all. There mightes thou fynde their coniurde hearbes, their threades and knackes of arte And, for to see the beldoms scarde, haue laughed out thy parte. The nynthe Satyre. IN GENERALL HE CONTROWLETH people inquisitiue, and importunable tatlers. That he doth dialogue wyse, and yet without naming of any person. I chaunced, to roome me in the streets, (as ofte I vse to doe) Musing, I wate not, of what toyes, but scanninge to and froe. Runs, vnto me a certaine man, whome erste I vnneth see, Imbracing me, oh pleasaunte lad, how mightes thou fare (quod he?) Horace, Well at this tyme, and wishe to the, all that thou canste require. When as I see him haunte me still, I askde him his desyre. Str. Why pardye, syr, know you not me? I am a greate lernde man. Horace: If it be so, I deme of you, so muche the better than. Lyues fayne, I woulde haue lefte him there, and hereuppon, I wente Now swifte, now slow and told my boy, tryfles to none intente. In faith I was through bathde in sweate, and thoughte them in good ease, That were well in their chambers set, or in sum secret place. When he woulde prayse, the towne, or streets, I answerde nought againe. I see, (quod he you woulde, that we were parted verye fayne. But all for naughte, it may not be, Ile wayte vppon you now. (Quod I) syr, spare your coortesie, I haue no neede of you. I muste go see, a frende of mine whome you did neuer know, Nye Cesars Orchardes, yonde Tyber, he dwelleth farre below. Strange. No busnes I, needes muste I walke, haue with you for this day, Horace. Then, (lyke the heuye lodened asse) myne eares downe did I lay. Str. Syr, if you knew my qualityes, there is no reason, why, Or Uiske, or Uarus shoulde be more, enteire to you then I. Uiske, &amp; Uarus two iolye Poets. For who, for number or for grace, dare mell with me in ryme? Or who can daunce so footinglye, obseruing tune and time? I can singe so melodiouslye, that verye Hermogene, Woulde enuye me or if he harde woulde yeelde to me I wene Ho. I thoughte to interchaunge a worde, thy mother lyueth she, Or any of thy kynsfolke els, that standeth neede of the? Str. In good time they are broughte to stay, and I remaine alone, Dispatch thou me, so it must be: for many yeres a gone, Sabella aProphetes. Sabella, (I a very chylde) did reede, my dreyre fate, In folowynge forme, with tendre hande, pressed vpon my pate. Not poyson keene, nor enmies sworde, this babe away shall draw, Not stitch or coughe, or knobbyng gowte, that makes the patiente slaw, A prater shall becom his death, therfore, let him alwayes If he be wyse shun iangling iacks, after his youthefull dayes. We came to Lady Uestas churche. the fourth parte ot the day Whilste language passed to and fro, was passed cleane away. He stode in bondes, (as he toulde me) in courte for to apeare, Or sentence els definitiue, shoulde passe againste him cleare. If thou doste loue me frende (quod he) to tharches with me draw, Horace: Nor can I stande, vpon my feete, nor knowe the cyuile law. Str: I doubte if I shoulde leaue my cause, or els thy frendlye companie. Horace, I pray the me, not yet (quod he before me, by and by He preseth on: my victor guyde I did succeade a pace, Str. How doth your lorde Mecenas now, how stande you in his grace? It is a rare and wyttye parte, in frendship long to dwell, Horace, I tell the as a frende, thou haste vsde fortune well, If that thou woldste plante me in once, (in forfitte of my heade) Thou shouldste no doubte, haue me a frende, woulde stande the in good steade. Within a monethes space or twaine, Mecenas I woulde claw That all the reaste mighte blow their nayles, or go to shough the dawe. Horace. We lyue not so, as thou doste thincke, no house, more pure then this, Nor none, that from those mischeues vyle, more cleane and spotles is. His, riches, or his learning is, no preiudice to me: There is a place accordingly, for eche in his degree. Str. A thinge thou tells vncredible: Hor. I tell a sothefaste tale. Str. Thou makes me glow faine woulde I cum to be of his counsaile. Hor. If that you will, you haue a grace, his fauour for to win The first assaulte is very harde, by suite thou maiste get in. Str. I will not fayle, brybes shall corrupte, his cheefist seruinge men Though once or twyce the gats be shut I will not cease yet then Ile wayte my opportunitie, to meete him in the way. To leade him home, to curtsey, and cap him when he stayes. There is no good for to be done, whilste we are lyuing here: Excepte we lye, faune flatter, face, cap, kneele ducke, crouche smile, flere. He pratling thus, a frende of mine one Fuscus Arisie, Met me, who knew this chatting syr almoste as well as I. Stocke stille we stande, he askde me whence, or whether, that I woulde, I halde him backe, and by the hande, of frendship did him houlde. Squintinge his eyes, he gan to nod, to call me thence away, And yet dissemblingly he thoughte, to dallie and to play. My harte in choller perboylde was, I wis my frende (quod I) You sayd, that you a matter had to tell me secretly. Fuscus. An other tyme, I muste go see the circumcised Iues In keeping of their Sabot day, what holye rytes they vse. Horace. I loue not that religion. Fuscus. I, of infirmitie Am scrupulouse: and therfore syr, I pray the beare with me. Hereafter I wilbe your man, both when and where you will, This day dismis me to go roume, throughout the streets my fill. Hor. The churle departes, and lefte me stille to feele my sharpe distresse. By chaunce there cums this fellowes foe, who, now had got redresse, At him by law: varlet, (quod he) I charge the for to stay, And pray you (Horace) geue me leaue, my mynde to him to say. Contente, (quod I), you may be boulde, to worke your will for me, My troublesum companion arested then I see. Both partyes crye, the croude growes greate throughe greate Appollos grace, It was my lucke for to escape, so comberouse a case. The tenthe Satyre. SOME HAD EUIL SPOKEN of Horace, for reprehendynge Lusille. He protesteth that he by no meanes, meaneth to defame the person, but to haue his, or their doinges bettred. Pretye other conceits and notes of versefyinge. Forsoth, I sayd, (Lusill) I sayde, your verses run not rounde. Doth any loue Lusill so well, to praise his Iarringe sounde? But he, through ticklinge vp the towne, with mirth, hath wun a name: And yet this doth not proue him lernde, though I shoulde graunte the same. So mighte our minstrell Laberie, be coumpted learned then, Laberie delectable in minstrelsey, &amp; yet not learned. If merye mirthe and onlye mirthe, coulde make a learned man. To make the reader laughe a pace, is not a Poets parte: I meane not all: though therein be, a prety peece of arte. He muste be quick to make his pause, and sentence, fall in time Els tracting longe, to weryed eares, will make a lothesum ryme. His treatice interchaungeable: now merye and now sad, In Poets puffe and now againe, in Retorique florishe clad. Sumtimes, a fable trymlye toulde, doth worke in better force, Then if the plaintife Poet shoulde besing his musies horce. Sumtime to spare his eloquence, and speake not what he can: Such were the auncient interludes, so were they lyked than. And so farre to be imitate, but neyther Hermogen, Demetrius.Nor other, who woulde seeme to be, so gay deuysinge men, Did euer reade (I dare make good) those lettred Poets woorkes, Saue Catull, and Caluus, wheras such paltrye baggage lurkes. Tush, now I glaunce, and blame amis for Lusill hath deuised, A tricksye worke in Lattin coate, and greakishe gardes comprysed. An auntrus ade, I promise you, O thou that knowes not muche, Cease to admire a man for that the matter is not suche, As it is thoughte, to sprincle here, and there a worde of greeke, Sum assehead doultes in baggish style, of greeke are not to seeke. Excepte thou thincke that diuerse tongues, are better when they meete As mixed wynes, (what els?) become more wholsome and pure swete. Well, in thy verse vse Greke at wyll beware, that when at barre Thou pleadest for thy clyent, there Petillus. thou goest not ouerfarre. I meane as yf some passyng man shoulde stande in plea thy foe, Poblicula or Coruinus. And sweate agayne to grauayle thee, and worke thy clyent woo. Use not thy two tongude phrases then, lyke one of Canues towne, Canues, a towne where was spoken both greke and Laten. Thou mayst perchaunce become nonesuite, thou and thy cause borne downe. Once on a tyme, a Greke poeme I dreamed to indite, (A Romayne I disioynde by sea, vnured so to write) Lorde Romulus dyd byd me stinte, in pitchye silent nyght, At mydnyght, when suche vysions are coumpted moste of myght. In grekyshe tongue (sayeth he) to write write vpon writyng styll, Is as to powre on fatted sowe, more draffe drynke and more swill. Therfore whylst Alphin shriketh out Alphin, a tragicall Poet. the murdred Memnons bayne And reigne descriues I leauyng Greke am of my Satyre fayne. Whiche neyther shall in Guyld hall once, be iudged of the Mayre: Nor fede the eye on stately stage, to make a meyny stare. Fundanus may at his good luste, Fundanus, A Comical poet, of nyncetie fynceties wryte, (I say) of harlots heedfull guyle of Dauns what a spyte, He wrought to Chremes by his crafte, That facultie therfore I leaue to hym as capitayne in scoffyng comyke lore. And Polleo, the princely iestes, in loftie Iambiques maye By vertue of that gracious verse, in tragike wyse displaye: So Uarie makes his Elegies, of quicke and lyuely myght, And Uirgile, well in rurall ryme, His gamesome Muse can dight, A Satyre, I more sauerly, and with more lucke attempted That Uarro, and a number suche, (all arrogance exempted.) I doo not say, before my tyme, But Lusille dyd deuyse, Nor euer ment to preiudice his crowne in any wyse Lawrell Crowne.But nowe and then outtakyngly. he wyll be ouerseene, And bryng suche stuffe, wherof the moste omitted myght haue bene. I pray you (Lusille) saye me soothe, nor be you not offended, Hath not your wysedome sayd or now, that Homer myght be mended? Actius.And hath not ioly Lusill to, the dolefull Actie chaunged? Ennius.And for to carpe hym for his phrase all ouer Ennie raunged. Yet, when he speaketh of hymselfe, He speakes not, as he were A better clarke, then those he blamde. Why maye not we inquyre In ways of talke? yf his harde style, a matter good hath marde: Or if the matter to vntoward, hath made his style to harde. If that a man thynke it enough, and for a poet mete, Twixt meale &amp; meale, two hundreth times, to reare vp on their fete: Lyke Casse, whose lauyshe eloquence, Cassus burned for his folishe bokes. was rushyng as the streames: Therfore were burnt, his corps, his bokes, (his hastye trauaylde dreames.) If this be good, Lusill is good, in suche respecte may he, Of pleasant head, and depe deuice, and clarkly iudgement be. He may be thought to haue enritchde Greace, with his Satyre verse, Muche better then an elder sorte, whiche I coulde nowe rehearse. Ryght happye Lusill, that dydst see so plausible a tyme: If he had ben in these our dayes, he muste haue razde his ryme. And parde of all that was not trym, and so haue bent his brayne: That bothe he should haue scratchde his heade, and bitte his thombes for payne. For nowe, who lookes to beare the bell, his doyngs he muste cull, At home with hym, and better adde, then he dyd erste out pull. Horace. Contented, to haue pleasde the wyse, lette go the skyllesse hobbes, Who woulde esteme the clappyng of a flocke of luskyshe lobbes. (Not I in soothe: the iudgement of one worthy personage, In learnyng rype, in vertue iuste, in verdite sharpe and sage: Geue me before a thousande lowtes, and all their lowde suffrage. Tygille he kepes a prattlynge stylle, his pages doo me pynche: Prate what they can, the worste they can, I mynde not once to wynche. Suche carelesse, brainlesse, senslesse shrubbs, suche sucklyng maultwormes, who, Dothe take their woordes, but as of course, and so can lette them go? The wise clerkes of that age.The lorde Mecenas and Uirgill, Plotie, and Uarius, Ualgie, and or drad soueraigne the great Octauius, And Polleo (I fawne not nowe, not flatter, thankes to pyke) Fuscus, and eke the Uiscie bothe, I woulde they should me lyke. Thou Messala, thy brother to, You Bubilie also, You Seruie, and thou Furnius, bothe you and suche lyke mo, Frendly and learnde, whiche nowe for hast vnnamed I lette go, Your praise I saye, fayne would I haue full sorie and full sad: If I ne can fulfyll the hope, whiche of my selfe I had. Sir Tygill, and syr Demetrie, Your dumpishe domes in schooles, You may bestowe where as you lyste, emongst your flocke of fooles. As for the wyse, they wynke at them, nor will not on them looke: Go boy, go note these sayinges well, and put them in a booke. Q. HORACE FLACCVS HIS SECONDE BOKE OF SATYRES. The firste Satyre. THE POET IS AT ALTERCATION with him selfe, and reasoneth if he should any further procede, in indityng of Satyres, sithens he was thought of some enuious persones to be sharpe spoken, and in dede a backbyter. He demandeth counsayle of the lawyer Trebatius: he defendeth his owne dede, and conuinceth his misiudgers. Some thynke my satyres too to tarte, to kepe no constant lawe, And some haue thought it lously pende what so of myne they sawe. And weane a thousand such lyke rimes, one myght within a daye, Write and dispatch: (old frend Trebate) what should I doo? a way To me prescribe, you byd me reste, my Musies to appall. Na, truste me truly by my thryfte, that were the best of all. But I muste nedes be doyng styll, you byd me, I knowe not what, To swymme in Tyber all the daye at nyght to keepe a chat. To drynke for lyfe, to quasse carouse, to loade my tottye noule, And by suche meanes restrayne my pen, and to surcharge my soule. Or yf I haue suche vrgent luste, and lykyng to indite, That then I should of Cesars fraies and passyng triumphes write. For that woulde fetche vs in the pence, and healpe me for to lyue. Alas (God knowes) full fayne woulde I, my courage wyll not geue Me so to doo. Not euery man the warlyke troupes so gaye, To morishe pykes, and brochyng speares. the frenchemen slayne in fray, The puissaunt Percie pluckte from horse, prayse worthie can display. Why myght I not iust Scipio, thy martiall feates haue praysed, As learned Lusille once tofore, suche bloodie bankets blased? I will assay, as tyme shall serue, Onlesse I wayte my tyme, It is in vayne, to exhibite, to Cesar any ryme. Whome, yf a man attempte to clawe, inflexible he standes, Yet, better were so to presume, then, for to fyle our handes. With bankroute slaue Pantobolus, and Nomentanus prankes. Sithe causeles all mystrust them selues, and cannes me litle thankes. What way for me? they say that I, am subiecte vnto drinke, And shotishely vppon excesse, laye out what so I thynke: Like dronken folke that hoppe and skippe, when lickour lodes their braine, And when through ill affected eie, Pollux and Castor, Iupiter and Leda their sonnes brethren to Helena. one candell semeth twayne. Borne of one egge, Pollux on foote, and Castor loues to ryde, Eche man his mynde. In studyinge howe many waies be tryde? I kepe one staie of writing (they saie) in melancholie moode, Like Lusill, sauyng that my witte, is not all out so good. Lusill, as to his very frende, so woulde he to his booke, His secretes good or bad bewray, looke on them, who woulde looke. Hym followe I in Lucanie, or bred in Appulie I wote not: For Uenuce my towne Uenucinum, iuste betwene Lucanie, and Appulie, ther was the poet borne. betwixte them bothe dothe lye. They Romayns Uenucine possesse, so sente into that place, Leste people nygh aborderyng, myght wyn the same in space. And therby noy the Romyshe wealthe, what so my countrey is: What so my wytte, my bytter style, strikes not a whytte amis. It maye bee lykened to a sworde, In sheathe for my defence. Synce no false lofels hurte me then, why doo I drawe it thence? O kyng, O father Iupiter, Woulde God the tymes were so, That ruste myght well deuoure this sworde, that none woulde worke me wo. But worke they doo, but who so does, though he be diuelyshe fell, I blason farre and nere his armes, and wanton touches tell. He may go howle and pule for wo, the citizens will scorne hym, And cause hym wyshe full many a tyme, his damme had neuer borne hym. The Lawyer when that he is chaft, will threaten iudgement fell: So Canadie our sorceresse with poyson will vs quell: Eche officer dothe menace eke, the worste that they can doe: All bragge of that, whiche is theyr best, and therwith feare their foe. And that nature allowes of this marke thou these notes with me: The wolfe with toothe, the bull with horne and howe this same myght be, Dame Nature teacheth inwardly. thou doste agayne replye, Stronge Sheua, wold not with his sworde, hys mother cause to dye, Though she had wrought him much mischief No meruayle, for the oxe Strikes not with tooth, nor wolfe with hele, strong poyson vsde this foxe. So he and they, the good and lewde theyr weapons haue by kynde, And vse the same to worke theyr weale: The gyftes therfore of mynde Shall be my beste artillerie: For whether quiete age, Abydeth me, or blacke, wyngde deathe encompasse me in rage, Come wealthe or want, at home, or els perchaunce an exilde man, I wyll not fayle, to write my state, if possibly I can. Trebate. My sonne, if that thou write to sharpe, no doubte thou shalte not lyue, Some one or other, wyll to thee Thy fatall wounde ygeue. Horace, Why? Lusill lyude, who euer vsde, all fayners to detect, With satyres sharpe, and quippies rounde, of deathe he neuer reckt. But blamed those, whiche outwardly doo geue a shynynge shoe, And inwardly are chargde with synne, that vnnethes they can goe. Good Lelie dyd not hate his witte, nor he that got renown For pollicie, and pruice too, For beatyng Carthage downe. I say they were not myscontent, That lewde Metellus once, Metellus and Lupus noble men, yet reprehended for vyce. Scipio and Lilius not repyning. And lowtishe Lupus were reformde, with Satyres for the nonce. He woulde not spare the officers, nor priuate men to blame. A frende to none saue honestie, and those that vsde the same. With doughtie stoute duke Scipio, and Lelie learnde and wyse, He woulde ieste very iocundly, One pointe of wysedom, not to be merye amongeste amultitude. and frankly in his guyse, At meales, when he sequestred was frome the vnlettred sorte. What so I am, though farre I wote, from Lusils witte and porse. Yet enuie selfe can not denye, but I haue ledde my life, Amongst the best, though some men thynke me dedicate to stryfe: Me thynks my grounde, is good and sure, excepte you frende Trebate, By lawe, doo disalowe of it, I will pursue my state. Trebate. Beware, beware, the warinde may lyue, be circumspect and slawe, Leste you by wordes vndoo your selfe, through ignorance of lawe. For who that writeth slaundrously, we lawyers muste amende hym: Horace. And who that wryteth true and well, our Cesar muste defende hym, If that a man speake of a zeale, And blame the bad alone, Dispatche youre rowles, there is no gayne, the Lawyer may be gone. The second Satyre. VNDER THE PERSONAGE of the Stoike Ofellus, he controlleth the gluttonous and riottous: he sheweth the varietie of meates them selues, not to be so dilectable, as they are so made by abstinence, and sharpe appetite. He c?mendeth muche frugalitie, whiche is chiefly in sparynge and thryftie diete. Howe good it is, and laudable, to lyue but with a small: It passeth me for to discriue, Offellus tolde it all. A rudesbie, and vnruly, wyse, and yet vnlucky man, Who neuer could bryng to an ende, The thynge whiche he began. Learne abstinence, O learne of me not when your paunche is full, Or when with grosse vpflyngyng fumes, Your syght is masde and dull: Or when your lust leanes to the worst, and wyll not brooke the beste, Come soberly, not ouerchargde, With intrayls all at reste. Some thyng to say: the wastefull wombe, dothe plague and kyll the brayne: As that iudge dothe his countrey hurt, who gapeth after gayne. When thou doste trace the hastyng hare, or tame the Iennet wylde, Or fyght in fielde, lyke Romayn stoute, (vnlyke a Grekyshe chylde.) Or when thou doest at footeball playe, or tennice for pastyme: Whylste loue of game dothe ease thy toyle, and helpe awaye the tyme: Or when thou slyngest in the ayre: with myght auoyde the stone: What so thou doste, do earnestly, and when thy toyle is gone, Thou shalt haue stomake quick and sharpe, that when thou comes to dyne, It will not loke for sweete conceytes, or fragrant friskyng wyne. If that the rude and vgly sea, doo lette the fyshers arte, If foode doo fayle, of breade and salte, to take and eate thy parte. Thou wilt be glad. Why is it thus? Howe soundeth thys wyth reason? The smell of hoate and smokyng roast, though it be deare and geason, Dothe not delyte of it owne selfe: thou makes the culleis good. Thy sweate and pyne, makes sweete and fyne, and sauours all thy food. What taste is there, yf thou beiste gordgde? ne can it well endue, In lampre, or in leueret, or choppyn oysters newe. Nathelesse, I can not thee perswade, but yf they bothe be dreste, The Pecocke, and the pubble hen, the Pecocke tasteth best. Begyled with apparances: because her costly sayle Is rare: and that a circled pryde She beareth in her tayle. As though that were materiall: her feathers doste thou eate, So gaye to thee? or is she ells, in brothe the better meate? The fleshe of bothe is muche alike: thou loues the pecocke, tho, Because of gallant gawyshe plumes: well, lette it then be so. Tuscus, a strete in Rome, nere to a creke of the sea.The Dogge fyshe, that from Tyber cums, or streame in Tuscus streete, Why is it worse, then that, from sea where wrastlynge waues doo meete? O dotyng worlde, aboue the rest, they loue the Mullet greate, And yet doo mynce her smale and smale before they doo her eate. Thus may we see, the syght is all: If syght make thynges excell, Great Porposes, shoulde be in price: na, sothely I can tell Why they be not: this porpose fyshe, with vs is euery where: A mullet for the mincyng dames, Farre sought farre brought deare bought good for Ladyes. for that is rare and dere. The temperate will litle eate and feede of simple chere. Some gluttons would eate greater fyshe, to satisfye theyr mawes, (Lyke hellyshe Harpies) from a panne, with gredie gnawyng iawes. But you, you wastefull southerne wyndes, corrupt their viandes all: It needes not muche: for bore or brytte, dothe taste to them as galle. When to muche hauocke hath them cloyde, then gyn they sore to longe For rapes, and Helicampane roote, and doo the beggers wronge. So kynges (to haue theyr courses iust) Reiect not pore mens cates, As egges, and oyle, with suche the lyke receyude and vsde of states. The heraulde Gallo for a dyshe The dishe, was a fishe cawled Accipenser a while vsuallyea and noble, afterward c?temptible. Pretorie, a frende to the kychin. He vsde vppon a day, Was yll rebukde. But they to blame: for brittes fewe durste assay. The Britte dyd scope abroade in seas, The Storke dyd kepe her neste, Before paunche pampryng Pretorie, tolde howe they shoulde be dreste. If some, the rolted cormoraunt, delytefull woulde reporte, Our youthe (soone taught to naughtynesse) would trye it for a sporte. The couetous and sparynge man we muste not note for one, (As Ofell saythe) if thou, percase from one synne wouldste be gone, And therby happe into a worse, that were a bootlesse case. Canis a couetouse myser. Canis, in whome for his deserte, that name maye well take place, Olde olyues.Olde oliues, and the dogtree fruicte, and lees of chaunged wyne, And vyle vnpleasaunt greasye oyle, to lothesome for a swyne. (If he dyd feast his frende at home, or kepe his natiue daye, One good note of a churl to be liberal of that which is naughte. Demaunde.Or solemnise the tyme by chaunce, in surly ryche araye.) Abundance of suche corrupt stuffe, Mongst his, he woulde outlaye. What dyet shall the wyse man then, twixte two contraries vse? Shall he the trade of couetyse, or prodigall refuse? Replye. Unspotted he, that kepes hym free, and leanes to neither syde. Albutye. He shall not be lyke Albutye, who, when he dothe deuyde, His housholde charge, emongst his men, himselfe wyll nothyng doo: Neuye. Nor yet lyke Neuie wayte at boorde, for that is foolyshe too. Nowe lysten well, howe great the fruicts, of sparyng diete be: First good for healthe, for thys thou must, perswade thy selfe with me: That many thyngs annnoyeth man, And meates doo muche offende, Though they be pleasant, yea and good, yet, when thou doste them blende, As, fyshe with fowle, roste meates with boylde, to choler goes the sweete: The moyst to fleume, for stomacke fleume a guest is moste vnmete. Agayne, the corps chargde with excesse, dothe ouercharge the mynde, Abandonyng to earthly thyngs, the sowle of heauenly kynde. The temperate may soone dispose his membres to their reste, And ryse agayne delyuerly, to labour quicke and preste. He shall be in the better plyte, In tyme that happen may, As when the yeare by compaste course, shall bryng the pagiaunt day. Or if he take confortatiues to helpe hym at his neede: For yeares wyll come, and crayse age. Worthy fruites of temperance. who dayntily must feede. In age, or sycknesse, what shall be, delityng vnto thee? Who haste preuented in thy youthe suche pleasure as myght bee? The rammyshe Bore, they wont to prayse, not that they had no nose To feele hym smell, but to this ende, that he whiche dyd repose Hym selfe with them, myght egerly fall to, and eate his meate: Because they woulde not gluttonlyke, theyr whole prouision eate. In those dayes, I woulde haue ben borne, in suche an honeste tyme: I loue well hospitalitie, If riot cause not crime. If thou doste stande in awe of verse, or force a rymers reede: Take heede suche sortes and subtilties of cates wyll make thee neede. Bothe shame and harme they wyll procure, agayne, adde to this same, Thy kynsmen wroth, thy frends made foes, thy selfe foe to thy name. Wyshyng for deathe, and shalt not dye, but lyue to wayle and mone Thy wanton wealth, thy beggers plight thy treasures that be gone. Tracit. (Saythe tauntyng Tracy) maye not I lay out my coyne at wyll? My rentes come to me thicke and thicke, my want is foyson styll, Not three kynges can dispende with me, who sayth, I may not spende? Poet. Therfore, the surplus of thy goodes applye to better ende. Why want the silly needie soules refreshyng at thy hande? Why doo the temples of the godds, without repayryng stande? Thou corsye carle, thy countrey dere, from hougie substance, suche Shall she haue naught? wylt onely thou deuoure alone so muche? O ieste, vnto thy very foes, For, whether may haue more, (If fortune frowne, and grefes growe on) esperance to his store? Thou: whiche was maried to thy mucke, and freshe in gay attyre, Or he: that dreading chaunce to cum, a litle dothe desyre And keepes it well, and warylye to helpe in hopelesse tyde, Lyke as the wyse, in golden peace for stormye warre prouide. For more beleefe in this behalfe, I then a little boy Can now reporte, that Ofellus, put not so greate a ioy. Nor pleasured so, in his cheefe wealthe, Ofels talke in prosperytie as in his worste decay. This was a common talke of his when he bare greateste sway. Als one to me: on woorkyday I neuer coulde be taken With better meate, in feelde or towne, then roots or chimnye bacon. I, and my sonnes, keepe thus in feilde, our cattell seelde forsaken. But if old acquaintaunce cum, Horace. A more honest kynde of literalitye. Who hath bene longe away Or sum good honest neyghboure els, through sleetie drisling daye, Do cease from woorke, we mery make not with suche costlie fyshe, But with a chicken, or a kyd, and grapes our seconde dishe, A nutte, or els sum kynde of figge, the table tayne awaye We drincke about, and afterwarde for Ceres giftes we pray. So, flye awaye the freating cares, that bringe the wimpled age, Let furiouse fortune frowne and fume, and roste hyr selfe in rage, She can not much empyre our cates: my seruaunts haue not founde. Umbrenus a souldier who had y? grounde geuen him by Augustus.Their cheare much woorse sence Umbrenus hath gotte away our grounde. It matters not for nature gaue not me this proper lande, At firste, nor him, nor any els, he chaste vs forth with hande, His beastelynes will chase him out, or sum expulsiue lawe, Or els his heire that shall suruiue, when he muste couche full lawe. Now Umbrens grounde, of late Ofells (a thing not very stable) Now myne, now thyne, so muste we take, the worlde as variable. Let nothing cause your courage quayle, in care be constante stille, And bende your brestes to beare the blawes of fortune that be ille. The thirde Satyre. THE POET SHEVVETH a greate skill or workemanship in this Satyre, especiallie, in that he earnestlye studying to make others good, is himselfe partely contented to be controwled by the stoicke Damasip, as a sluggarde and pretermitter of duetifull occasions. The stoicke proues sinne to be a certayne kynde of madnesse. Damasip. You write so seldom vnto me, that fowre tymes in a yeare Scarse cums a pen within your hande, perusinge written geare. Halfe angrie with your selfe I weane, that drente in wyne and slepe, You spendinge time in sylente pause, of Satyres beres no keepe. Performe thy promis once at lengthe, goe too, what shall we haue? Thou coms from Saturnes feaste I trow, from drinke thy selfe to saue. Will nothing be? You blame your muse, so do you Poets all, Accuse your pen, when to your mynde, your sentence will not fall. When thou camste to the countrye towne, to lyue a parte from strife, Thy visage gaue, as thoughe thou wouldste haue written bookes for lyfe. Menander, and dan Platos woorkes, why do they on you wayte? Why broughte you Eupolis to towne, and Archilog his mate? You meane for feare of spytefull folke, all vertue to disclame, Thou caitife shalte cum to contempte, shun idle ioyes for shame: Or els surrender all suche praise, as thou haste got before: By woorke of witte, in full intente The Poet contente to be reproued but not at suche a peuishe Marchaunte as to mell with it no more. For this sage counsaile, (Damasipe) the heauenly goddes I pray, this stoicke damasip.To sende a barber speedelye, to wype your berde awaye. Horace. In deede, and knowe you me so wel, how cums it so to passe? Damasip. I sufferde shipwracke of my gooddes, whilste I a merchaunte was. And therefore now can spare an eye, the worlde to ouervewe. Then was I plunged in affaires, as they me droue and drewe, To know what vauntage by exchaunge, to clippe and washe my goulde, By subtilties in mineralles, my state for to vphoulde. By suche lyke sorte came I to haue, an ample wealthie snare To purchasse orchardes for mine ease, and bowers bryghte and fayre. My witte so deepe soe sore to deale, such lucke, to win or saue, That me a Mercurialiste, to surname then they gaue. Horace. I know it well and maruaile much, If that be ridde and gone: Excepte thou haste sum worse diseas whiche needes will rayne alone. As Phisikes cure from heade to breste, diseases can conuey, As by excesse of much madnes, dryue lythergie away. Perchaunce you setting fraude a parte, the mad mans part will play. Dama. Frende Horace, you are mad lykewyse. And so is euerye foole, If stoicke Stertin taughte vs once, true doctrine in his schoole. Of whome, I learnde this trade of lyfe, no trewande in my lore, He dubde me then a stoick sage, and bad me morne no more. Though all the worlde shoulde go to wracke, (for from a brydge I mente All headlonge to haue horlde my selfe so things againste me wente.) Approchinge nygh. O do not so, frende Damasip (quod he) What thirlinge throwes doth twitche thy harte? what shame confoundeth the? The stoicke. Startine supplyeth with his talke almoste all the satyre folowinge. The people cawle the giddishe mad, why, all the worlde is so: If thou be mad, and thou alone: be drounde: I lette the goe. But what is madnes to defyne? Crysip, that noble clarke, Cals all fooles mad, and all whose mindes, are duskde with errors darke. This rule, makes mad a noumberouse swarme, of subiects and of kinges, And none exemptes, saue those in whome, the well of wysdome springes. Now leane thyne eares, and listen well, perceaue howe all be mad, Yea those who earste to make the woorse, such mockeryes haue had. Admit there be through darkesum wood, a speedie footepathe way, On ryghte syde same, on lefte syde sum: and all do go a stray. Through wilsumnes of wildernes: the error is all one, Though through miswandringe diuerslye, they diuerslye haue gone. Thou maist be mad, (frende Damasip) A reason to proue al mad, whiche treade not in one true footepathe of wisedome.thou maiste be muche vnwyse, Thy mockers staringe mad also, though in an other guyse. One manner frensie is, to feare when nothinge is a misse, As hilles on plaines, or seas on mountes, this kynde of buggor this: An other like a desperate, nothinge at all to feare, To trudge through deepe, high, hoate, and coulde, to prease vppon a speare. His frendes reclames his sister deare, his parentes and his wyfe, Theirs rockes, theirs Seas greate dread (say they) sweete kinseman saue your lyfe. He will not heare, for all their crye, no more then Fusie coulde, When he through force of drowsie drincke, was falne in slumber coulde. He shoulde recyte the drunkards parte, he druncke his parte away, The people egde him for to speake, he wiste not what to say. One way or other all are mad, as Damasip, which oulde Pictures did bye, was mad, and he, that lente to him the goulde. Moste mad is he, that takes a truste, not hauynge hope to pay: Moste mad is he, which may make boulde and dare not his assay. Assay (quod you) but who woulde truste, for now the worlde is suche, That lende a man, a thousand crownes, or more, or nye so muche, And take a bill of his hande wryt, an obligation make, So lawyer lyke, so clarklie drawne, that none coulde it mistake, And bynde him strayte, to kepe a day, in payne of marks and poundes, Shew witnes write, and what thou canste, or lowse, or shake thy groundes The one will he do: lyke Proteus, to shapes ychaunged, he Somtime a bore, a birde, a stone, and when he liste a tree. No doubte he will attempte all shiftes, to shifte him selfe from the. If wyse men vse for to do well, and fooles for to do ill, What say you to our creditor, Petill vsurer our vsurer Petill? Is he not mad? who when he lendes, for increase asketh more, Then the pore debter can performe, though he shoulde swelt therfore. Ye lecherouse, luxuriouse, ye supersticiouse: Ye shottishe, dotishe, doultishe dawes, that nothing can discusse. Drawe on my Clyents one by one, be not agreiste ne sad, Stande still in stounde; kepe whishte (I say) whilste I doe proue you mad. I charge you, you ambitious, and you that mucker good, To gerde your gownes, to sytt and harcke, whilste I doe proue you wood. The couetouse, of Helibore: the greater parte muste haue, One parte of a mad man, to seeke, vayne glorye after his deathe.Or rather all the pilles, for the head as they which moste do raue. The executours of Staberie, engraylde on his graue, What were his ample legaces, and what to them he gaue. For so he bad in testament, and if they woulde not so, That then to maintayne sworde players moste of his gooddes shoulde go. Areus superuisor of y? wil.Arrey did superuise this will, who shoulde geue them in wheate, To preserue sporte, as muche as halfe a countrye coulde well eate. Staberie..What though I did (misiudge me not, Stoicke.I had a wittie meaninge. No doubte you had, to this intente, was all his gylefull gleaninge. To haue his heyres, entayle in stones his honnorable will: Neade was to him a wickednes, yea an vngodly ill. Therefore in deede full dreedefullie, he wayed it as goddes curse: If at his death, then in his lyfe, one dodkin he were worse. For all and euerie thinge (quod he) vertue, renoumne, and fame, The corpes, the goste, doth crouche to coyne, and serue vnto the same. Which who so hath all at his luste, him needes no further thinge, He maye be famouse, stonte, and iuste, a wyseman and a kynge. And this is euen as good as if by vertue he vp grue: But Staberie or Aristippe, Aristippe a Philosopher that flattered Alexander. of lykely, iudge not true. Who trauaylinge in Lybie coste his golde caste away, Because it did from iorneyinge, his men a litle stay. Whiche is the madder of the twaine? but we ne can, ne will Sample, againste example bringe, to samples that be ill. If that a man bye instruments, and horde them in a place, Him selfe not weyinge of the sounde, nor forcinge musikes grace: If that a man shoulde bye him stuffe, and tooles to sett vp shop: Or bye him sayles to hange in ship to hale her by the top: And neuer meane to practise oughte, is he not staringe mad? Why is not this our couetouse as much in frensye clad? Who hoordes his monye, and his gould, and vnneth dare auouche it, Because it is so preciouse, to peepe at it, or touche it. If that a man an hudge heape of corne shoulde euer keepe, With stretched arme, and club in hande, for feare berefte of sleepe, And beinge owner, durste not take, one graine, (misdreadinge waste), Eatinge most bitter rootes and leaues, vnmilde vnto the taste: If, one haue manie vessels full, a thousande tun of wyne, And drincke nothing but vinaiger, vntastie and vnfyne: Goe to, if one of fyue score yeares do lye on couche of grounde, And haue his downe, and fetherbeddes, (where he mighte sleepe full sounde) Stufte vp in chestes, for wormes and mothes: sum will not houlde them mad, Because the moste of wealthie men, be now as vyle and bad. O hatefull head, forlorne to God, spares thou for tyme to cum? Na, na, thou spares that thy lewde childe may spende the totall sum. Eche day will spende sum portion, (thou thinckes) if thou do spende Oyle to annointe, oyle for thy borde, mongste thy meates to blende. Further, thou sayste, it is the beste, to lyue vppon a small Why doste thou then forsweare thy selfe, and filtche in places all? Testie anger a kynde of madnes.Haste thou the wittes, that beates thy men, because nothinge can please the? Which thou with purse, haste purcheste deare, to ayde the and to ease the. When thou doste poyson thy parentes, and strangle vp thy wyfe, Arte thou not mad, though in Arge towne, thou droue not out her lyfe Nor yet with sworde as Oreste did, or do not it inacte? Yes, yf for hope of gaine thou haste, but thoughte vppon thy facte. A m? is mad at the first c?cept of mischiefe.Was he not mad before his blade had brusde his mothers baine? Or forthwith, as this cruell fitte, Was crepte into his braine? Synce that Orestes hath bene clepte giddie and mad by name, After the cryme, he hath not done, a facte, of haynouse blame. His syster deare, nor Pylades, he neuer stroke with sworde. To him, and her sumtimes he gaue, a foule vntowarde worde. Her feende him woorse, as him to speake, his pearsinge choler woulde: But thou in harte kilste all thy frendes, that thou mightes haue their goulde. Opimie. The penyfather Opimie, who had so muche in store, Who holyday and workyngday, did toyle whilste he were sore, Was troubled so with lythergie, for sleepe he coulde not stere, His heyre wente rounde aboute the chestes, with blythe and iocaunte cheare: A frendlye quicke Phisition, to make, Opymie starte, Contriude it thus: he bad them bringe, a borde into the place A sorte, eeke to vnseale the bagges, and tell the coyne a pace. He rearde the sickman from his bed, Syr (quod he) houlde it faste Or els no doubte, those will haue all, and sparple all at laste. In my life tyme? Phi. awake betime, be lyuely then in deede. Opimie. What shall I doe? Ph. fall to thy meate, there is no way but feede. Els, will thy spirits be for faynte, thy vigour fall away, Thy stomake weake and languishinge, will bringe the to decay. Op. You geue me naughte. Ph. drincke vp forthewith, this Ptysande made of ryce. Op. What shall I pay? Ph. a small Op. how much. Ph. Two pence. Op. alacke, the pryce. Such costes is woorse, then sworde or theefe, cum death I will not ryse. Damasip. Now who is mad? Sto. Eche foolish man, what is the couetouse? Dam. A foole and mad. St. what if a man be nothinge rauenouse, Eftsones shall he coumpted sounde? no: Dam. Stoicke tell me why? Sto. Put case the restlesse paciente, full ill at ease shoulde lye, His pulse doth shew, he hath no stitche, nor straininge at his harte: Is that ynough to warraunte him, forth of his coutche to starte? Sharpe panges may twitch him in the reynes, and twitche him in the syde: So, though one be not couetouse, yet may he swell with pryde. They neade no salue, to say a sooth. that vse not for to lye, Nathelesse the testie may take pilles, to purge melancolye. Almoste as ill to hoorde thy goodes, that they geue no releefe, As if thou shouldste bestow them on, an arraunte pilferinge theefe. Oppidie.

Stoicke. A man that faultreth in hys speache, for age, and yet is gladde, To playe at quoytes, or spancounter, may well be counted madde: A man, that faultreth in his speache, and wyll by sworde and myght, Obteyne his loue, or murther her in cruell blooddy plyght: As Marrius slewe Hilade, Marius a knowen Romane: esprisede with the loue of Hilade.

Who so that calls me wood or madde, maye learne his propre lacke, And knowe the ferdle of his faultes, that hange behynde his backe. Stoicke. Frende Damasip, though you haue loste your trafficke and your ware: Yet may you gayne, for some will geue that you theyr faultes maye spare. Damasip. Because thers many kyndes of madde, in what sorte doo I dote? Yet to my selfe I seme not madde, nor from my witte a iote. Stoicke. No more semed Agaue to her selfe, when she of dolefull chylde, The head detruncte dyd beare about, she thought her selfe full mylde. If soothe it be, that I am madde, yet stoicke tell me this, What vice is it, through whiche I seeme so muche to doo amys? Stoicke.

A matche vnmete betwixte you twayne, and yll appoynted too. The mother frogge vppon a tyme abrode to feede, or playe: A Calfe kylde all her young, with foote, but one, that scapde awaye: Which brought the tydynges to her damme, howe suche a myghtie beaste, Had slayne her noble progenie, (to tell a blouddie feast.)

The fourthe Satyre. THE POETE COMMONETH with the Epicure Catius, who reueleth vnto hym a great companie of scholetrickes of that secte. The poet nyppeth hym floutyngly, as he dyd els where the precisde Stoike, and suche the lyke fondlyges. Horace. From whence, and whether Catius? Catius. I haue no tyme, farewell, To teache a schoole of newe preceptes, not suche as doo excelle, Pythagoras, or Socrates, or lettred Dan Plato. Hor. I graunt my gylte, at yll aspecte, to speake vnto you so: Nathelesse, I hope your maystershyppe, Wyll beare with me thys ones, Some dayntie doctrine of your secte, and nouell for the nones Propounde, of nature, or of arte, for you in bothe doo passe. Cati. Yea syr, to speake of matters all, that aye my commynge was: And for to speake accordyngly, of rude and homely matter. Horace. A Romayne, nor an Alyen, that taughte you so to clatter? Catius. I wyll disclose his mysteries, but not bewray his name: Least some, myslykyng his preceptes, the author selfe myght blame. The Epicure his schoole. Egges longe and whyte, be nutritiue muche better then the rounde: Egges rosted harde, be costiue, yea vnholsome and vnsounde. The gardeyne herbes be not so swete, As those on mountaynes bee: The watrye soyle, the vertue slakes, that it is not so free. The moushrom that doth spring in meades, or in a supple grounde: Is beste, for suche as growe els where, moste noysome haue ben founde. If guestes come to thee at vnwares, in water myxte with wyne, Souse thou thy henne, she wyll become, shorte, tender, neshe, and fyne.

So Coos wyne, with sorell meynt, hath vertue to expell. Shelfyshe, in growynge of the moone, is beste to eate or sell: Not euery sea, hath fyshe a lyke: Pelore in Lucrin growes, The Murer fishe from Baiæ cums, whence purple coloure flowes From Circes choppynge oysters newe, From Micen vrchen fishe, Of sealed Scalop, Tarento bragges, as her proper dyshe. To furnyshe well a feast, is harde, a thynge not learnde in haste: He that woulde doo it gorgious, must haue a practisde taste. Its not enough to fraight the boorde with sea fyshe out of measure: There muste be brothe for squaymous folke, and spices all of pleasure. In Vmbria the maste fedde bores, doo charge the vessels greate: Uessells, whiche haue not in them borne, the common sortes of meate. The bore is yll in Laurente soyle, that feedes on reakes and reeds, Somtymes, frome goodly pleasant vine, a sower tendrell speedes. The Epicure a Benefactor to the Calat.Who lykes to eate the fruitfull hare, her forepartes are the beste, The choyce and vse of fyshe and fleshe by me fyrste were expreste. I made them so delicious, so welcome to the taste: Some can vouchesafe theyr wittes and paynes in pastrye for to waste: It is not muche commendable, to knowe a knacke or twayne: As if in brewinge spyced wynes, thou shouldst bestow muche paine: And sauce thy meate with foystie oyles, thy gesse wooulde the disdaine. If thou wilte purge mounteflascon wynes, and make them pure and cleare, Set them abrode in open ayre, when many starres appeare. The greuouse smell, by force of ayre, will passe and fade away: Through streyning of them through a clofhe, the good smell woulde decay. To mingle in thyne egge at meales, a litle sacke and saulte, Doth mende the yelke or whyte therof, if it haue anye faulte.

The stronge may eate good looshiouse meate, in kytchins whiche be dreste, The kitchin phisicke, is for them, simplye, the very beste. It is behouable to knowe, of sauce a double kynde, The one, of simple olyue oyle, as we in arte do fynde. The compounde hath that goes therto, Constantinoble bryne, Herbes shred, and minced very thicke, some kynde of compounde wyne: An oyle from Uenefratuum broughte, (Lo) that is passinge fyne. Moste commonly, that fruite is beste, that lyketh best the eye. Some grapes may be conserude by meanes, some pressed by and by, I taught the waye, to kepe them greene, without all ylde or faulte, To eate hearryng with iuyce of grapes, white pepper, and blacke saulte. All those I badde, for to be borne, In vessels of greate pryde. A fayre brode fishe muste aye be borne, in vessells large and wyde. To lashe out all, is not the beste, it can not be denyde.

To haue suche necessary thynges is hansome, and lesse deare, Seclude neatenesse, and then no waste, Can make delitefull cheare. Poet. Sir Catius, for Goddes dere loue and myne, my prayer is, An other tyme, to leade me, where I maye heare more of this. Though well I wote, you coulde for skille, haue played the maisters parte, Yet nothyng lyke the Epicure, the father of the arte. Besydes his graue and modeste lookes, and reuerent attyre, Woulde make one heare him muche the more, with zeale, and great desyre. Whome you perchance esteme the lesse, because you happie stille, Enioye his syght: but I doo wishe to go vnto my fill, The christall fountaynes harde to fynde, and there from vertues rife, To take and practise perfecte rules, of pure and blessed lyfe. The fyfte Satyre. VLISSES AT HIS HOME commynge, beyng brought to greate extremitie and miserie asketh the counsaile of Tyretias, a prophete in hell, howe he may be riche agayne. In Vlisses consyder the state of pouertie, in Tyretias talke the vngodly counsayle, of the deuyll, and the priuie suggestions of the worlde, and her practises. Vlisses. Tyretia, at my request, tell me a little more, Howe maye I be, so riche a man, as I was once before? By what meanes, or what pollicie? (prophete) why doste thou smyle? O suttill pate, arte thou not well, from shypwracke, and exile, To haue escapde, thy housholde goddes, and Ithacke Isles to see? Vlisses. O prophete soothefaste in thy speche, alas) but seest thou me, How bare and beggerly I cum, into my natiue lande? (Thou hauyng so foretoulde my fate) nothinge in plyghte doth stande? The wooers spende vp all my gooddes, and howses do defyle. My stocke and vertue, withoute gooddes, are thoughte as thinges most vyle. To cut of talke, since pouertie thou doste abhorre in harte, Now harken how from deepe distresse, a wittie man maye starte. By sending, pretie presents still, be sewer thy giftes to geue, Unto the wealthie ritch mans house, that is not lyke to lyue. The turtle doue, the orcharde fruite, the honours of the feelde, The rich must haue before goddes selfe, what so thy grounde doth yeelde. Who though he be a periurde man, of currishe kyndred borne, All gored in his brothers blood, a runagate forlorne: Yet coortsye him, and woorship hym, and if he woulde it so, Thou maiste not stay to wayte on him, in place where he shall go. Vlixes. Can I becum a page to slaues, to get a sillie catch, Who, erste in Troye, euen with the beste, was wonte to make my matche? Tire. Therfore, still poore. Applie the worlde, and beare it as it is, Vlixes. Yes, I haue borne, and can abyde, thinges waightier then this. (Good wysarde) tell a speedie way, and driue me of no more: Howe maye I fyll my pouches full, as they were heretofore? Tyre. I sayde, and eftsoones saye to thee, be pregnaunt aye in guyle, Thou muste be forgynge olde mens wylles, And if that in thy wyle, Thou arte perceyude, yf none wyll byte, but all from hooke doo flye: Though ones deceyude, dispaire not tho, persyste thyne arte to trye.

The other, if he haue a wyfe, or hope of progenye, Thoughe all the worlde proclaym hym good lette thou his quarell lye. Do clepe the other, by his names, (fayre wordes with fooles take place:) Right worshipfull, your vertues (saye) hath made me pleade your case. I haue some practise in the lawe, to parle and maynteyne plea, In faythe, I rather woulde myne eyes were drenched in the sea, Then any of these fyled tongues, Your worshyppe shoulde abuse: Or spende yonr goodes. Well go you home, and cease you thus to muse. Plucke vp your hearte, leaue all to me, trye what a frend can doo. In heate or colde, I am your owne to ryde or els to go. Assay the consequence hereof, some one or other wyll, Name thee, an heartie frendly man a man of witte and skyll. Thy hunger shall be great excesse, thy wante muche wealthe at ease, The Tunnye and the whale wyll be, scarce presentes thee to please, But here a caution for the, least some shoulde replye agayne, That thou doest good to sole olde men, as gapyng after gayne. If thou canst spye a wealthie man, that hath a wearyshe chylde, There, shewe thy selfe officious, muche debonaire and mylde: And caste out talke as though thou couldst, proue thee, his seconde sonne, Then plye the olde man, so to saye perchaunce, when he hath done, The chylde may dye, then, who but thou? make entrie on thy right, Suche loose begynnynges, oftentymes, growe vp to force and myght. If, that the olde man offer thee his testament to reade, Make, as thou coulde not, for great grefe, put it awaye with speede: But take a superficiall syght, if thou muste all possesse: Or dyuers mo cooparteners: them thou with crafte muste dresse. By threatnynges or by flatterie, by smothe talke gette thou all, As Esops foxe allurde the dawe, to lette her breakefaste fall. As Corauus with suche lyke sorte, deceyued Scipio. Vlixes. Why art thou mad, or mockst for nonce, for doomyng harde thynges so? Tyre. Laertes sonne, what so I say, muste be, or ells not be, For great Apollo hath bestowde. a prophetes gyfte of me. Vlixes. Unfolde this fable vnto me, this mysterie bewraye. Tyre What tyme this yong man, feare of Parths, begynnes to beare a swaye, (Augustus Prince) by lyne extract from duke Aeneas race, When he shall beare the countenance, and welde the wreakefull mace, A noble dame to Corauus, shall Scipio the bolde Dispouse, and yet for couetyse her dowrie large withholde, Corauus shall a feoffement force, and eke the writyng seale, A cuttyng wrytte for Scipio, whiche he ne shall repeale. I geue thee furthermore in charge, yf any dotynge syer, Be ruled by his mayde or man, thralled to theyr desyre, Acquainte thy selfe, forthwith with them, Praise them, that thee awaye, With gratefull praise, and lyke for lyke, they may agayne repaye. A worldly rule to seeke acquaintaunce at or better: A safe rule Cum æquali æquale tibi uis erit.But what of them? seeke euer to the chiefest, and the beste, Prayse hym, laude hym, so shalte thou be, in tyme a welcome gueste. In case the carle be leacherous, his byddyng doo not byde: Bryng hym thy chaste Penelope, to whome thou waste affyde. Vlix. Penelope, so temperate, so continent a dame, Whome suche a route of reuellers, coulde neuer stayne with shame. Tyr. Those younkers came not for to geue, Prostitution practised for couetise.but hunger for to staunche, They came for lucre, not for loue, to paumper vp the paunche. But this (lo) were a present waie, for her and thee to lyue. Losse made your dame, so temperate, Her trouthe to none to geue. I (beynge then well elderly) at Thebes, there was a wyfe, Who charged strayghtly her assignes, whylste she was yet in lyfe, That they shoulde noynte, and hold her fast, if she could wraste away, That then their hope shoulde want his hyre, and mis his wyshed praye. These shewe to thee, that he that woulde, ryse vp by deade mens bones, Muste play the bawde, the slaue, and loute, and paynfull for the nones. Beare well thy selfe, serue in suche sorte, that naught maie be amended: The testie, tethye, waspishe churle, with pratlynge is offended. Yet sumtymes that thou merelie, lyke Dauus in the play, Abate thy lookes, as thoughe the man with presence did the fray. Be euer duckinge downe to him: if all things be not warme, Besech him thou, to keepe him close, leste haplie cum sum harme. Be stille, and whishte, whilste he speakes oughte, stretch out thy listninge eare, And neuer cease to magnifye, whatsoeuer thou doste heare. In case he will be blasoned, sounde and resounde his prayse Forge and deuyse, puffe vp his harte by any kynde of wayes. What time the wretche drawes to his ende, releasinge the of paine, Then will he say, geue Vlixes, a quarter of my gayne: Of all my substaunce of this worlde. which voice, then thou doste heare, Alas (say thou) Dama my frende, shall he no more appeare? O Dama frende, wilte thou be gone? how maye I haue so good, So trusty true and stedfaste frende? howle, crye as thou werte woode. Weepe, if thou canste, a litle crashe, dissemble all thy ioy, Uppon his toumbe, an hansom coste, and laboure eeke employ, That neighbours maye commende thy facte, and yet, a further note: If one of thy cooparteners gin, to rutle in the throte, Take him asyde, and salue him fayre, and tell him if he please, He shall by howse, an lande of you, for vse, or for his ease. Muche more (as thou doste lyke of this) to the I coulde haue sayde But, I muste to my hellishe taske perforce my toungue is stayde. Proserpina, our tyraunte Quene, so vengefull, and so fell, Dothe hayle me hence, to byde the smarte, with smouldred soules in hell. Ye, worldlinges make suche shiftes as those, adew, and fare you well. The sixte Satyre. MODERAT AND SPARING Liuinge highlye commended the Countrey muche Preferred before the Citie: the pleasure of the one, and the trouble of thother.

Sume trees, to ouer shade the same, the goddes, this good beheste Haue graunted me: they haue fulfilde, and betterde my requeste. Content. Graunte this, frende Mercurie, (for nothinge elles I craue) Graunte this good god, for tearme of lyfe, this lyuelod I maye haue. If I got not my goodes by fraude, nor pore man did oppresse, Nor thorough ryot, on negligence, do meane tomake it lesse? And, do not vse to wishe, so vaine, as foolishe worldlings do.

O that it were myne happie chaunce, to fynde a pot of goulde, To purchesse fearmes, such worthy fermes as now are to be soulde. As some haue done, as he to whome, God hercules did bringe, A gubbe of goulde, who sence hath bought, a woorthie wealthie thinge. A manor, here and now dothe till his grounde, and cherelie singe. If god haue lente me anie thinge, I thanke him much for that. And praye him, for to make my sheepe, and cattle verye fatte. And, for to fatten all I haue, excepte my witte alone: If that be fatte, adew good lorde, our musies maye be gone. Synce I am cumde from cyty now, into the countrye towne, What shall be done (my ryming muse?) shall I in satyres frowne? Not lewde ambition vexethe here, nor washye southerne wynde: Nor fruitlesse harueste, burninge tyme vnto the feeldes vnkynde. Thou father of the morninge tyde god Ianus, by thy name, In whom, men take in hande their woorkes and sett vppon the same: O Ianus, helpe thou on my verse, thou knowes the cruell coyle In Citie kepte, as eeke the eases of quiet countrie soyle. In Rome, I needes muste ryse bytime, to be some suretie, To speake to him, and him for them they still do call on me. Though whiskinge wyndes, do shaue the earth, and though the snawishe day, Be shorte, and sharpe, I muste abrode they wil not let me stay. If that I speake not pleasinglye, but vprighte in my mynde, Then sure I am in places all, ynough of foes to fynde. I muste be crowded in the throng, and staie, when I woulde walke, What ayls this foole? how shoues he one suche is their angrie talke. Or if we to Mecenas walke (for that is all in all,) That makes our greate vnquietnesse to seme to vs so small. (I make no lye) as sone as I draw neare the Pallace place, An hundreth suiters call to me, to speake vnto his grace. One cals on me, at two a clocke, to moute hall for to go. The scribes pray me, for maine affayres to haste the moute hal fro. If there be any grauntes drawne out, that tarrye for the seale, They cry on me, vnto my lorde the thinge for to reueale. A seuen, or eyght yeares, now it is, synce that Mecene my lorde, Did dub me his, and bad me cum aye welcom to his borde. Not to debate of graunde affaires: in waggen, for to ryde, To tell, or heare sum tryfled thing, I placed by his syde. As thus, how that the day doth spende, in maygames, and in play The Tracian, or the Serian, whiche bare the pryse away. And of the season of the yeare, and how the morning coulde, Did nip the foole, in summer tyde, that looke to nothinge woulde. Suche talke, as into eares of drabbes, safelye man mighte power. Through this, mine hatred, quickned firste and kyndled euerye hower. For if in case the noble duke, did solace hym abrode, (Lo) yonder (sayde they) fortunes whelpe, and mokde me where I rode. If from the preeuie councell cum, sum muttring of the warre, Then, who that meetes me, questions me, and greetes me fayre from farre. People. Good master, (you do know those goddes because of neare accesse) Must we to warre on Dasia, our selues in armoure dresse? Horace. I harde it not. Peo. By gisse, (Horace) you wil not leave your mockinge: Hor. Then on my heade (in stiddie wyse,) let all the goddes be knocking. Peo. Cesar, made promisse he woulde geue his souldiers grounde to tyll: In Scycilie, or Italie? Sir, what is Cesars will? Horace. Me swearinge, that I know nothinge, they maruaile, as at one, Of famouse taciturnitie, and secret gyfte alone. In cile, thus I spende my dayes, in muche recourse of care: O manor place, when shall I see, thy groues so freshe, and fayre? When shall I soundlye plye my booke, and at my vacante howers C (ut from the worlde) profoundlye sleepe, amid the fragraunte flowers? Pithagoras, when shall thy beanes, or colewoorte sybbe of kynde, Refreshe, my hungry appetyte. whilste I haue supte or dynde? O nightes, and suppers of the goddes, in whiche both I and myne. Make cheare, at home: my iollie men do feede so cleane, and fyne? Of all the townishe delicates, of what, so lykes them beste, My straungers francklye take repaste, with lyuelye harte, at reste. When, that our sobre companye, begins to warme with drincke, Of purchasinge, or supplantinge, we do not eftsones thinke: In trothe, our talke it multyplyes, but not of baude, or queane, Or who dothe friske it beste in daunce, no, it is chaste, and cleane. Of knowledge, most behoueable as if in ryches be, Or in vertue, the chefest good, (I clepde felicitie.) If frendship springe of vse, or gaine, or do to vertue tende What is the good calde soueraigne, what is her verye ende. If any praysinge hurtefull goodes, of ignoraunce do fayle, Our neyghbour Seruie, hearing that, steppes in to tell his tale: Full gosseplike, the father sage, beginnes his fable then: Fable toulde. The countrye mouse, did enterteyne, within her homelie den, The citie mouse, the olde hostesse, her olde acquainted frende, Doth welcum, loth to sparple muche: and yet for to vnbynde, The corsey anguishe of her geste, with syghtes of daintie fare: Not hurded pulfe, nor longe stalkd otes, (the prodigal) doth spare. She serues in mouth the curnell drye, the gobbets chewde of larde, To please her geste, with cheefeste meates, was cheeflie her regarde: (Her geste that tasted on eche thinge with toth of muche disdaine) The rurall mouse eate new thrushde chaffe, and put her selfe to paine: Reseruing wheate, and cockle flower, (two dishes of muche ioy) Unto the fyne fed citizen, a straunger all to coy. At lengthe bespeakes, the cytie mouse, my frende why lyke you still, To lyue in countrye fastynglye, vppon a craggie hill? How say you? can you fynde in hearte to haunte, and set more by The citie, then the saluage woodes? marche on, be boulde to trye. Our earthelie soule is ruinouse, not possible to flye, From dinte of death, by any meanes, the longeste liude muste dye. Wherfore good sister, whilste thou maiste, do bayth they selfe in blisse, Remember aye, how shadowye, and shorte this lyfe tyme is. These sayings, moued the rusticall, full lightlie leapeth she, They both begin this gay exployte, the citye for to see. Benighted cum they to the towne: (for, midnighte then did hyde The midle parte of roumie skye) when both at equall tyde, Did presse their foote, in pallas proude: where scarlet vestures reade, On Iuery beddes, did glose with gleames, as it were glowing gleade. Muche was the noble remainder, or gorgiouse supper paste, Whiche was bestowed in baskets shutte, not clasped very faste. Therfore, this straunger (countrie mouse) on purple quishion set, The townishe dame (as nurturde well,) her noble cattes doth fette. A feaste, of much varyatie. she like a seruinge page, Dyd daine to go to bring, to taste, in proper personage. The trauailer, dothe lyke her chaunge, and quyte deuoyde of feare, As dedicate to feaste, and wealthe, doth glade her selfe with cheare. All sodeynly, the clappynge dore, doth fraye them into flore, Affrighted sore, a rounde they trip, Dismayed more, and more. Also the vaste, and ample house, of mastie dogges did sounde, The mowse, beset in sorye wyse, doth shape her answere rounde: Farewell. I neade not suche a lyfe: the harmelesse wood, and caue, Can comforte me, with fatche, and tare, and so my bodye saue. The seuenth Satyre. IT IS GOOD AND PROFITABLE, for the Maister somtymes to heare, the true, and honest instruction and aduertisment of his seruant. In olde tyme, seruantes might speake in the moneth of December, whilest Saturnes feastes were solemnised, frankly and at randon. The Poet bryngeth in Dauus, detectyng his maysters practises. Dauus. Ere whyles, I listned to your wordes, and sumthinge woulde haue sayde, But, I a scruaunte, and Dauus, was halfe, and more a frayde. Dauus, a true, and trustie page, so much as sence will geue. A frende sir, so farre vnto you, as I my selfe may lyue. Simo. Becawse our auncitours so woulde, the freedom of decembre Enioy speake out, all things amisse, that, thou doste nowe remembre. Dauus. Some men do stifflye sticke to voyce, and still pursue theire praye, Sum, to, and fro, now well now woorse, and kepe no common stay. Lyke Priscus, chaunginge of his ringes, who such attyre had boughte, And chaungde his suites, so ofte a day, him selfe hathe chaungde to noughte. His house, and lande, to morgage layde, yea, neede dothe him compell, In simple cotage to abyde, where scarce a slaue woulde dwell. At Athins, verye studente lyke, at Rome, a lustie lad, I maruaile, what vnstable starres what byrthsygnes, once he had. Volauery, stickes to, one trade, for gowte, he can not ryse, And therefore nowe he fees a man, to caste for him the dyse. Such constaunte folke, be better, then those chaunglings in and oute, Who plunge in euerye follye which theire heades can bringe aboute. Simo. Wilte thou not say, thou stretche hempe, thou whome thou meanes in thy pratlynge? Dauus. I meane euen the Si. How so sir knaue? Da. For, thou wilte still be tatling. In praysinge, state of forayn tymes, but, if that thou mighste chuse, And god would place the in those worldes, no doubte, thou wouldste refuse. Or thou in hearte didste neuer thincke, whiche thou in worde hast sayde, Or thou not stoutlie cleauiste to the truth as halfe vnstayde. Scarce fullie yet resolude, to plucke, thy foote out of the myer. At Rome thou loues to be abrode, abrode thou doste desyre To cum to Rome, and doste extoll, that lyfe aboue the skye. If thou beeste no mans geste abrode, then doste thou magnifye, The priuate cleare, as thoughe thou wouldste. be bounde to lyue so still: And thinckes it well, that thou ne goste, to tipple, and to swill. But if sum bid the cum indede, thou lins, not then to crie, Oyle, water, haste my seruants haste, awaye, thou doste the hye. Full manie sillie seruiters, that wayte with emptie paunche, Say to them selues, when will this churle, his glutton stomake staunche? I am a smelfeaste bellygod, idle and full of slouthe A greedie gut, and at a worde, a seruaunte to my tothe. Synce thou arte euen as yll, as I, and worse to, in thyne harte, Howe durst thou fyrst begynne with me, as though thou better wart? Thou canste disguyse thy synne with woordes, thy wyckednesse vnfoulde, Thou arte more foole, then I, which earste, for fyftye grotes was soulde. The satyre altered.Explaine thy browes, restraine thy handes. alay thyne anger fell, What Cryspins porter, toulde of the I will make boulde to tell. (Quod he) Dauus, that sillye foole, hathe not his masters caste, His harte, is euer in his toungue, for if the facte be paste: He takes no sounder reste, whileste he, hath chatterde oute the thinge, Then dothe the swyne, that hathe her groyne new wounded with a ringe. In open day, in open streets, he praunces, and he prates. He makes the younkers, all a flote, to breake the brothells gates. His acts, are euer euydente, and therefore, ryfe in talke, Because, he doth not make pretence, nor vnder coler walke. His master, goes in sage attyre: that geues a sober shue. His master, solempne in his wordes: that makes him seme so true. Dauus in sighte of all the worlde, dothe as I sayd before. Simo, dothe all that pryuilye much willinge, to do more. Simo, is ryche and rubbes it out: for goulde hath this by kynde, To louse or tye the tongues of men, and to contente their mynde. Simo maye be a goose, a sheepe, a noddie, and a daw, And haue not giftes, or qualities, to counterpeyse a straw: Yet Parasytes, will tearme him good, and wyse, at all assayes. I wisse, redde goulde, can make a doulte, a paragon of prayse. If Dauus do but talke amisse, a cockescombe, or a bell, Such badges, mighte beseeme oft tyme, the masters very well. The reyster weares not alwaye plumes, nor yet the deuill a tayle, If euery foole did were a bell, there would be iollye sayle. Simo can laye to vsurie, and yet by plea of sleighte, He will persuade the thinge to be, a sinne of little weighte. So drunckennesse, is felowship, furye, is manhood boulde, Fondnesse, is francknesse, and scarcehead, for thriftynesse, is houlde. In fyne, no cryme, no vyce, no sinne in Simo, muste be knowne: No faulte in Dauus, but forthwith with trumpet, it is blowne. Yea, Simo can cloke leacherie, or clepe it, by such name That nowe, it seemes, a neyghborhood, a thinge of little blame. Simo. He slaundered me, (Dauus my man, I am no leacher, I. Dauus.

A gaine thou arte not with thy selfe, thou neuer arte at leasure, Thou canste not reste, nor take a pause, nor muse at thinges of pleasure.

In faith, my frend it lyked me so muche, That ere this tyme, I doo beleue, there neuer was one suche. Horace. If, that it be not tedious, nor doo not you displease, What meate was fyrst, your angrye mawe, that gan for to appease? Fundanus. Fyrst, had we brawne from Lucanie the Father of the feaste, Sayde, he was slayne, when southerne wynde his blusteryng blastes releaste. Rapes, radishe, lettice, Sherwicke rootes, brothes tarte in taste, and quicke Came next, to make our stomake slowe, more vrgently to pricke. Fayre trenchers then was calde for straight, the purple carpett dreste Eche man desyres to sytte nexte hym, that tauntyngly can ieste: Ribauldes and cockescombes are in dede, a sauce vnto our feast. Fooles haue with vs a priuiledge to tell who, what, and when, Fooles speake ofte tymes, the very thoughtes of wyse and wittie men. There was the costly cullices, the Turbut, and the Pyke, The Porpose and the Porpentyne, with many suche the lyke. Pygge, partrige, peacocke, sparrowe, whale, so many of a rowe, That scarce the eater leaueth roome, to fetche his wynde, or blowe. All thynges, so formally brought in, so solemnely assayde, As though on alters to the Goddes, the bankette had bene made. What drinke you maisters (quod our hoste?) Gascoyne, or Rennyshe wyne? We haue of all sortes in this howse, bothe lately brochde, and fyne. Then, when that wyne had wonne the field, and maisterde all our guesse, Lorde, what it was a ioye to see, howe some it downe dothe presse: Lyke as the thynge that heauy is, of Nature so is made, (Excepte the same by violence forholden be, and stayde) To fall to grounde: lyke as the oke, of substance styffe and stoute, Cums downe, when he with dyntyng axe is hewed rounde aboute: So doo our hoglynges synke foorthewith, (theyr heade a Baccus barge) Wyne, is I tell you burdeynous, and passyng full of charge. Some synges of loue, and louers fittes, and howe Cupides darte Dyd smyte hym gentyll sowle amysse, so beautyfull an harte. Some mourne and blame their sorie fate, why Fortune shoulde be suche, That they suche blouddes, shoulde nothynge haue, and others ouermuche. Some chyde, some chatte, some raue, some reele, and some can take the payne, Of curtesye to geue myne hoste, his supper vp agayne. Some wyll vnfould bygge mysteries, and frame his matter so, As though he had aboue the reste, gotte Phebus by the toe. Some, wyll lament the state of tymes, and howe that all is nought, Howe thynges be rysen in theyr price, and howe they haue ben bought. Some sweare, that they haue lyued yll, and howe to morowe daye, They will accorde with all the worlde, and gynne an other playe. Howe Uertue is a perelesse dame, howe fewe doo her imbrace: This will they preache in gestryng wyse, as though in publike place The thynge were done (lo Horace lo) our suppers and our cheare: We spare no coste, we may not aske if it be cheape or deare. We keepe a troupe of seruynge men, a crewe of lusty brutes, And these for our great honours sake, muste cutte it in theyr sutes. These be our handye instrumentes, to woorchen all our will, Not scrupulous for to inquire yf it be good or yll. So many, so officious, that not one heare may lye Amisse on vs, but he or he, will spye it by and by. We laugh at those, when then are drunke, those make a sporte alone: To scoffe at straungers, when as they with drinke are ouergone. Horace So, so, no more Cupide can not from hyue of honey lycke, But one or other bee, forthewith will sting hym with her prycke. The world, the hyue, the combes, the welth whiche who so dothe assaye, Pleasure in face, poyson in tayle, Lyke Scorpion they wyll paye. The stynges, that pricke, be chokyng cares These hony tasters haue: Whilst they are toste within them selues, to seeke, or howe to saue. Wealthe is a thynge moste venomous, and fewe or none we fynde, But pleasure hath lyke Circes cuppes yturnde them from their kynde. Why shoulde the wyse esteme so muche, a rowte of waytyng men? Who, in theyr age moste commonly, what are they? beggers then. Brought vp so lewde, contynue lewde retchelesse, and ydell swaynes: Not knowyng arte, or handycrafte, nor able to take paynes. To kepe them braue, doothe euen as muche thyne honour true vpholde, As yf thou shouldste make thee a tayle, and gylde the same with golde. Is hospitalitie in those, in feedyng any suche? In kepyng stronge and heddy drynkes, in beluynge ouermuche? Lyke spunges neuer satisfied, and lyke Ulisses foes, From meate to bed, from bed to meate, and so their circle goes. Deuisers of all wantonnesse, what should I tell you more? Good, to increase and multiplye, their lorde or maysters skore. I do suppose, that yf mens wealthes, shoulde answere to theyr wylles, That nyght and daye woulde scarse suffice, to reuell out theyr fylles. Eche man is counted of moste price, and mete to be a lorde, As he with dyshes can depaynt, and ouercharge a borde. No talke howe wyse, how vertuous, or to take paynes howe able, But yf he kepe great store of drynke, or honourable table. Therfore some people parasites, that they may seeme to passe, Wyll spende out maluesey, muscadell, and fumyshe hypocrasse. And make their cookes looshiously, theyr delicates to dresse Their very meates in insensiue, broughte in, in suche excesse: That I doo lothe them more in mynde, as thynges more full of harme, Then, if that witche, that Canadie, had cursde them with her charme. FINIS. The wailynges of Hieremie, done into Englishe Uerse. The argument tendyng moste to the ruine of the citie, as it was destroyed by Uespatian and Titus Romaynes, and theyr souldiours. Ierusalem, is iustly plagude, and lefte disconsolate, The dame of towns the prince of realms deuested from her state, The sheene and glosyng paragone, that blased as the sonne, With wreakefull hande of iuste Iehoue, for synne is quite vndone. Synne, synne, vpturneth towne and tower, though it be stronge and hye, Great Babell fell with hautie toppe, that menaced the skye: Ierusalem tormented sore, and bruised in her walles, Remedylesse is ruinous, and therfore downe she falles. And holdyng vp her broyled lymmes, and gastfull scorched face, Woulde nowe fayne flee to God for healpe, and call vppon his grace, Good Hieremie with sobbes and syghes, that all the Citie heares, Dothe waile and wayle, the ruthfull case, his penne full fraight with teares. The fyrste Chapter. Howe sytts the Citie desolate, so populous a place? The ladye of so many landes, Becumde in wydowes case. The Princes of the prouinces, her tribute nowe muste paye, Full sore wepte she, full sore wepte she, all nyght her longe decaye. Alongst her cheekes, the furrowyng teares, from watrishe eyes dyd rayne: Of all her louers, nowe not one, to comforte her in payne, Her frendes thynke muche to visite her, her frendes are turnde to foes, Iehoudah, captiue ledde away Iehoudah the tribe of Iuda a captiue for the woes. And slauerie she brought men to) she takes no kynde of reste: Mongste pagans, where she makes her bode, with foes she is oppreste. Oppreste or taken. The stretes of Syon mourne and wayle, Because there nowe is none, That cums and goes to see their feast, as heretofore haue gone. The gates deuoyde of folke, the priestes doo sygh in sorowes keene, The damsels drent, in moyste of teares, the dame her selfe in teene. Her enemies rule, and who but they? in wealthe surcreasyng faste, The Lorde hathe shente her greuouslye, for heapes of lewdnes paste. Theyr younge, wente captiuate before, her muche dysdaynfull foe, From chylde of Tsyon, all her grace, and noble hue dydde goe. The Potentates lyke strayinge rambes, not fyndyng where to feede, Without all courage, went with those, that dyd them dryue or leede. Hierusalem bethought her selfe, vpon the dismall daye: Of scourge, and of her rebell heart, of all delytefull gay Thynges, whiche she had in alder age, what tyme her folkes so coy, Fell into foyshe hande, and none, woulde succour their annoy. Her enmies hauyng throughly seene, and noted her at will. Dyd scorne her sacred sabboth day, and gyggle out theyr fyll. Ierusalem, outragingly was dedicate to vyce. Therefore is she a mockynge stocke, all those in aufull guyse, That honourde her, and dyd to her, theyr homage heretofore, Doo clepe her, as a fylthy drabbe, and sette by her no more. What shoulde she doo? she gaue a sighe, and lookde askaunce awrye, Polluted foule within her skirtes, Her ende she woulde not eye: And therfore lushed downe at once. All comfortlesse was she: Citie.Rue O lorde, rue vppon my panges, the foe is prowde at me. The foe hath stretched foorthe his arme at all her thynges of pleasure. She sawe, she sawe the prophane route, rushe in, without all measure: Unto thy sacred holy house, that route, whiche thou (O Lorde) Forboddste, that they, ne shoulde come in, the mansion of thy worde. Her numbrous folke (a syghyng flocke) and seekyng after foode, Dyd geue for meate, what so they had, thynges precious or good. To cheryshe theyr so needie sowles. Marke Lorde, and weye on this, Howe vile I am, howe beggerly, My caytife plight it is. O all wayfaryng passengers, for Gods loue, locke and see, If euer griefe were lyke my grefe: for he hath scourged me. The Lorde (I say) hathe spoke the worde, in daye of furye fell From hye, he flonge the fyre adowne, my mortall bones to quell. It tamed me: Before my feete, a trappynge nette he layde, And turnde me backe, to captiue yoke, He, he, (alacke) hath made Me desolate: in gulfes of grefes, all day longe dydde I wade. My heynous synnes, my swarming crimes, to Gods dyre hande are tyde, And thence amayne vppon my necke, from tyme to tyme dyd glyde. Empired I: The Lorde hath put me in suche straynyng clawes, That neuer shall I wrinche me from, the pressyng of their pawes. My woorthies, and my valiantes, he trode them vnder feete, Within my selfe, agaynst my selfe, he made assembles meete, To slay my youthe, was neuer yet, Wynepresse bestamped so, On one virgin Iehoudahs chylde, the Lorde hath stamped (lo.) Therefore wepe I, and from myne eye, as from a water spoute, A flowyng streame, of gushyng teares, eftsoones doothe issue out. My comforter, he kepte aloofe, that shoulde my sowle relieue, My broode berefte of hope, and those preuaylde, that dyd me greue: Ofte proferde Tsyon, foorthe her hande, but none woulde healpe her tho. Great Iacobs rase, the Lorde had plasde amydde her enemies so. Ierusalem, mydst all her foes, is lyke a drabbishe queane, Foule steynd with fylth of mouthly floures a strompet muche vncleane. Iosias their kynge.The Lorde is iuste, disloyall I, haue forsde hym vnto ire, Hearken O worlde, hearken all worldes, once harke at my desyre. And viewe and viewe my thyrlyng throwes what plunges me assaye: My virgins, and my yonge men eeke, are captiues gone away. I calde my louers, one by one, but they begyled me. My priestes and elders in the towne, throughe famyne peryshde be. For foode to theyr forefainted soules, longe soughte they farre and neare, See Lorde, and see, because that I am troubled in eche where: Myne intrayles swollne: my hearte yturnde (suche is my strugglynge paine,) The swoorde deuoures abrode: our home a slaughter house of bayne. Full well knewe they, howe sadde I was, but none woulde solace me, My foes pursewde my harmes, and ioyde, to see them sente from the. But as for sinne, thou broughste on me, a wreakefull vengaunce day: Deale iustlye (Lorde): and as to me, to them their guardon paye, Surueye their mischeefes all in mynde, and deale with them as sore, As thou haste dealte with me pore wretche, for trespasse heretofore. They made the surgyes of my sighes, to multiplie eche daye, They made my heart a well of woes, wearyng it selfe away. The seconde Chapter. Howe hath the Lord in furie fell, beduskde his daughter dere, Tsyon his chylde of Israell, The glory bryght and cleare From heauen, to earthe translated lyes: and in his vengefull day, To batter downe his owne footestole, the GOD. irefull would not stay. He flung it headlonge, neyther sparde, Iacobs fayre blasyng bowers. So, shoke he downe, of Iudas chylde, her fortresses and towers. Through glowyng furye, to the soyle: the kyngdome he prophainde, And wreakde for state, the royall wyghtes, that ouer it had raignde. What so was in all Israell, of passynge price and grace, He marde it quite, turnyng his hande backe, from the enmies face, He kyndled vp in Iacobs sonns, a wastefull flashe of fyre, Which consumde all thynges rounde about, as it were in a gyre. He bent his bowe in foyshe guyse, and further, lyke a foe, He stretchde his arme, what so was fayre, or of muche beautie (lo) In tabernacle of Tsyon, he dyd it all deuoure, And slockmeale lyke to many flames, his wrathes he dyd out powre. The Lorde hymselfe was nowe a foe, he flonge great Iacob downe, Flung strong wals down, huge r?pirs down and bulwarkes of the towne. Fylde Syon full of heartie griefe, appallynge all her ioye: His tente, as it a gardeyne were, tramplynge he dyd destroye. He stroyde his folke, he rasde theyr feastes, and sabbothes out of mynde In Tsyon: To their kynges and priestes, through Ire he is vnkynde. The Lorde hath lefte his altar, and hath cursde, whiche ones he bleste, He gaue vnto the enmies handes, suche houldes as were the beste. The prophane flocke, within Gods house, in mockerye dyd crye, As in theyr sacred Sabboth, once, thelecte dydde synge on hye. Resolude was he, to thwacke downe walles, to euen theim with the flore, And not to turne his hande from waste, theyr rampyre mournde therfore: The battred wall, prostrate dyd fall, flatte leuelde to the grounde, The earthe supte vp the gorgious gates: their yron barres so sounde, He knapte in twayne: mongste Heathens are her Kynges, and puissant peares: The lawe is not: the Prophetes nowe, from Goddes mouthe nothynge heares. Fayre Tsyons elders, in the lande sytte downe in silence deepe. Theyr heade yrubde with ashes pale, theyr corps styll dydde they kepe In sackeclothe wrapte. Hierusalem, thy virgins freshe and fayre Doo hange theyr heades with poutynge lookes, (as caste away with care.) My streamyng eyes, dissolue to naught, my belchyng bowels rumble, My lyuer pyckte vp, through great force, tremblyng on grounde dyd tumble. Suche was my pitie towardes myne, because my babes dyd faynt, And sucklynges tawmed in the streetes, through pyne dyd them attaynt. Ofte cryed they to theyr mothers sadde, where is theyr wyne or breade? Lyke wounded wightes throughout the streetes, they sounded in eche stede: Unbodyinge theyr sely soules, vppon theyr mothers lappes. What should I name? to what should I resemble thy myshappes? O daughter of Hierusalem? what myght I beste compare, To thee, O myne, O Tsyons chylde, to mitigate thy care? Lyke droppes, in hougie tomblyng waues thy flockynge troubles greue the. Aime, myne owne good gyrle, (dere God) who shall releue thee? False prophetes blearde thyn eies with lies who woulde not playnly tell, Thy synnes to thee, to penitence, that they myght thee compell. They scanned theyr lewde prophecies, and reasons false woulde geue, Why, thou shouldste draw in captiue yoke and longe in bondage lyue. At the (chylde of Hierusalem) all those that passed by, Dyd clap theyr handes, and nod their heades and tauntyngly say: Why? Is this the towne so perfecte buylt, the Paragon of hewe, The ioye of all the worlde so wyde, that gaue the gladsome shewe? Gaynst the all foes dyd ope theyr mouthes, with vyle reproches fraight, And hyssde, and gnashde, and cryed marche on, Lette vs deuoure her straight. This is the daye, the wyshed daye, we haue her found and sene: The lorde hath done, what in his minde of longe tyme erste hath bene. Fulfilde hath he, his greate beheste, forspoken long before, Hauoke made he in all excesse, of nothinge made he store. He stirde thy foes, to laughe at the, and thy yll willers all, By his sole meanes, did mounte aloofe, as thou from hye didste fall. Theire hartes abrayded to the lorde: O wall of Syon towne, Forthe of the fludgates of thyne eyes, let fluddes of teares run downe. Unceassauntlye. do way all reste, the apple of thyne eye Applye it still, with moister still, take heede, it neuer drye. Aryse, praise him in silente nighte, prayse him in earlye day, Power oute thyne harte, to him as thou. wouldste water power awaye. Lifte vp thyne handes, to god, that sittes, in empyre, and in seate, That he maye helpe thy babee for faynte, with pyne in euerye streate. See, o lorde, see, consyder well, with home thou hast delte: O, And shall the mothers eate their yonge why lorde, and shall they so? Shall they thus grinde with teeth the fleshe, that from their fleshe did ryse, (Their children scase a full span longe?) the preistes, and prophetes wyse, Be murdered (yea) in thyne owne house alas, and shall they dye? Both yonge and olde, through all the streetes, Uppon the could grounde lye. My virgins and my youthfull Brutes, are fallen with stroke of sworde. Thou haste them kilde, and sparde not one, in day of moodye worde. Thou calste as in a solemne day, my terrors rounde about, And in that day such was thy ire, not one on lyue got oute Those that by me were choyslye fed, and tenderlye vp broughte, Are all consumde: (woes me) consumde, and vanishde all to naughte. The third Chap. I am that wighte, that abiecte wighte, whiche mine owne neade haue seene, Whilste that, the massie rod of God, vppon my backe hath bene. He tooke me and conducted me, to darknes, not to lighte, Turnde gainste my quite, all daye his h?de, he turnde againste me righte. He filde my skin, and fleshe with eelde, and brusde my bones in small, He buylte in gyre and compaste me, with trauaile and with gall. Bestowinge me in darkesum shades, (as one forlorne for aye) Inuironing me rounde about, leste I shoulde scape awaye. And pressinge downe with pondrouse gyues, my feete whiche els mighte flye, He will not heare me when to him, besechinglye I crye. He hath forestopde my pathes with stone, and crokde my wayes a syde, (He was a rampinge beare in waite, a Lyon dyre, vnspyde, My waies he staied and nie dismaide, of hope he made me bare, He bente his bow, and for his shaftes, a marke he set me fare. He causde his quyuer arrowes keen, my raynes for to assay, I was a mocke to all my folke. their sonnett all the daye. Woormewood my drincke he ballasde me, with balefull bitternes, He brake my teethe, and ashes gaue, to feede me in distresse. All reste disharboured from my soule, my wealthe, slipte out of minde, My strengthe is gone in god (quod I no further hope I fynde. I beare in mynde the stertlinge panges, the woormewood, and the gall, Freshe, freshe, ingraued in my soule, my courage downe doth fall. Nathlesse, this vnderpropte my soule that truste coulde neuer quaile, Goddes grace makes vs not to reuelte, his mercy cannot faile. A wounder woorker is our God, beleue in him, will I God is my part, (so sayde my soule) Meaninge of Christ. I looke for him from hye. The lorde is good to those in him, that put esperaunce woulde, Good to that soule, that seekes for him, as for an anchor houlde. Its good to truste vppon the lorde, his sauinge health tabyde: Exceading good for all, whiche from his preceptes doe not slyde. He that was proude and bare him hye, muste syt in hushte alone, And humble him vnto the duste (If all hope be not gone.) And lende his cheeke vnto the stroke, nor recke at wordes of spite, This man the lorde will not forsake, he will not leaue him quite. Though smartingly he visit him, and bitterlie him beate, Yet, can he not but rue on him, suche is his mercie greate. For, man because he will not stoupe, nor bannishe pryde from harte, Therfore such men God tryes and makes, them feele such netlinge smarte. He treadeth vnderneath his feete, the captiues of all landes, Who so doth iniurie the pore, before the lorde he standes, Wronge iudgement and iniustice all Underst?des after the Caldie targ?the lorde he vnderstandes. Who now can say but all thinges cum, by goddes mere prouidence? Prosperitie or aduersitie.Fr? his sole mouth, things sweete or sharpe do they not flowe from thence? Why is man loth for lawlesse lyfe, by law to suffer paine, Let vs insearche and trye our selues, and turne to God againe. Let vs arreare our handes and hearts to God on hye alone, Declynde haue we, rebelde haue we, therefore thou spareste none. Thou hast orewhelmde vs in thy wrathe, and bet vs to too sore, Slaine, and dispatchde, dispatched all, with none lorde haste thou bore. Thou haste inwrapte the, so in cloudes, our prayers can not perse, We are like roges, and runagates amid the pagans fearse. Our enmies gainste vs in despite, did ope their gapinge chappes, Our feare, and eeke our snare is cumde, deepe daunger, and mishappes. Myne eye, doth sende out goulfes of teares, to mourne my folke oppreste, Mine eye, lyke stillitorie runs, and weepes, and knowes no reste, Mine eye doth melte mine hearte, for all my daughters of the Citie, Whilste that the lord throw down his lookes, and from aboue take pittie. My foes pursude me as a birde, Yet iuste cause had they none, They thruste me downe, in dungen darke, and stopte it with a stone. The water surgies wet my heade, I am forlorne (quod I) Therfore lorde from mine erksom den, vppon the did I crye. Thou hardste my voyce, shit not thine eare, but heare my dryrie plainte, Thou stoodste nye me when I did crye and badste me not to fainte. Thou waste the proctor of my soule, and didste my lyfe restore, (O Lorde) thou didste perceaue my wronge, adiudge my cause therfore Thou seest gainste me, their furie all, their damnable intente, Thou hardste their wordes of villanie, their thoughtes how they were bente. Their bablynge lippes, that rose at me their corner muttrings see, At downe sittynge, and vprisinge they make a songe of me. Accordinge to their dealyngs lorde, rewarde to them disburse, Geue them for agonie of soule, thy greeuouse shendfull curse. Pursue, pursue them in thy mode, confounde them by and by. Where so (O lorde) they make abode, vnder the shrowdinge skye. The forth Chap. How is the gould bedimmed so? the gold moste pure and fyne Is chaungde. The stones and glittring perles, of holy house deuine. Flocke meale, to corners of eche streete are scatered, and roulde: The peares, and nobles of Tsion, compared well to goulde, How are they now adnihilate, accoumpted in the lande, Lyke earthen, vessels woorkemanship, of potters mortall hande? The dragons, (beastes of famouse feare) and dreadefull, with their tonge, With propper brestes, (as kynde hath taughte,) do nurse theyr cresyue yonge: But mine, the daughters of my folke, (wightes cruell, and vnkynde) Lyke Ostriches in desertes flye, and leue their fruite behinde. My sucklings tounges, cleaue to their roufe, they were so clammie drye: They calde for breade but none was broughte, therfore in vaine mighte crye. Those whiche had fed so sumptuouse, did pyne in streetes for meate Babes wrapte in scarlet mantles once, their ordure glad did eate. My peoples crymes so manifolde, were more innormouse vyle Then Sodom sinne, Sodom, that suncke in such a sodein whyle. No enmie ought his tente at it, it felte no mortall blow, My straite lyuers whyter then milke, Nazer y? Hebrue word signifieth separated: the translatours cal it the Nazireth, I thoughte better to call th? straite lyuers. whyter, then driuen snow, And rosall ruddish reade within clare rede as preciouse stones, And pollishde lyke the Saphyre gay, cleane pollishde for the nones: Their visage vernagde all with blacke, yblackte with colishe smeare Go now vnknowne, that once in streetes, so admirable were. Their ryueled skinnes, clongde to their bones, vnseparable be: Their cracklinge hydes, britle and brashe, as dryed barke of tree, Better to dide vppon the bladde, then perste with pyne to lye, In lingringe languour, and at lengthe for lacke of foode to dye. The mothers (els much pittifull) did boyle their sucklings small, And eate them vp: so extreame was my doulfull peoples fal. The lorde hath wroughte his wrathe at full, and powred out his ire, And brente Tsion downe to the grounde, with eger grypinge fyer. Not kinges, or any man els wheare, did euer thincke it so, That through Ierusalems stronge gates, coulde entre anie foe. Not sole Prophets, but preists haue set God, in this chafinge moode, Preists seruisable to Idols, and gorde in blessed blood. The blynde bloodmungers, blynde with bleed, did straie the streets aboute, And when they coulde not see the pathe, Much otherwyse in the Geneue byblebeholde they trode it out. Hence, blooddie wightes, hence (quod the foes) fye, fye, awaye, awaie. Touche nothing hence ye currishe bruits and make no more delaye. Both parties chid, both parties stormde, some of the heathen sayed, This people shall dwell here no more the lorde will keepe them stayed, The aufull countinaunce of God, hath scattred them in sundre, Nor euer meanes to mynde them more, pardye, it is no woundre: For they vnto the roiall preists, woulde yeue none honor due, Nor on the grisled horye syers, the retchlesse woulde not rue. Whilste, that we lookde for our vaine hope, our eye sighte gan to dase, We lookde for landes that coulde not saue. nor ride vs from the maze. They hunte, our steppes and trase vs, that in streetes we can not go, Our race is run, our dayes are don, and death will proue it so. Our persecutours, swifter then the Egles of the skye, Chaste vs on mounts, and in deserts, in wayte for vs did lye. Uitalls staye in the Hebrue nosethrills breth. Our vitall stay, and steddie aide, Iosiah nointed Kynge, Our payze of sinne, and plage of payze, did vnto bondage bringe. Childe of Edom, that in Husse dwels Edom flowted. thou needes not carcke nor care: For thou shalte pledge vs on this cup, Geneue for bare sayethe vomit. thou shalte be druncke, and bare. Tsion, that scourge of thyne is paste, God will no more exyle the, Edoms childe the Romanes proceadinge for the more deale of the Edomites. But Edoms chylde hath plague thy sonnes, and shewde what did defyle the. The fyfth Chapter Ieremies prayer. Remembre Lorde what hath betyde to vs beholde and see Our opprobryes, and what they are, and eeke are lyke to be. Our heritaunce is cut of quyte, and turnde to folke prophaine, Our houses by the aliauntes the barberouse is tayne. Our mothers (sillie as they be) like wydowes, sytt alone, Orphanes are we pore Orphanes we, and father haue we none. We boughte the water whiche we druncke, for wood our coyne we payde, Our neckes were hamperde vnder yoke, restlesse fainte, and ill stayde. To Egipte, and Assiria, our hande of league we lente: That we might haue a smal of bred, our carcas to contente. Our parentes they transgreste thy law, and now they are no more, And we their burthynouse offence, and masse of trespasse bore. Slaues ruled vs, and none woulde ryd vs, from their handes, and gyues We earnde our bread with extreme toyle, and hasarde of our lyues: Because of wastefull sworde that from, the deserte did issue. Our skinne is blacke throughe pauling pyne, and lyke to soote in hue. The wedded wyfes in Tsion towne, were wickedlie defeilde, And Iudas virgins, were deflourde (all chastitie exilde? The princes and the potentates, are hanged by the handes, No man in feare, or reuerence, of elders vysage standes. Our yonge men, lyke to vylaine thrawles, in drudgerie did grinde, Our children, (babes infortunate) to gallowes were assignde. The elders rauishte from the genets, the yonge men from their songes, Our ioyful harte is gone, our daunce is whyninge at our wronges. Our glittringe crowne, our temple braue, the lorde did quyte fordoe, Woe euer woe, and out alas, that we haue sinned so. Our hearte with sadnesse is surchargde, our eyes can see no whit, Because mounte Tsion is forsakte, and foxes run on it. But thou, O Lorde for euer standes, Aye duringe is thy throne, Why doste thou stil forsake vs, (Lorde) still leauinge vs alone? Turne, O Lorde, turne thee vnto vs, that we maye turne to thee, And make our dayes as at the firste, from sinne, and mischiefes free. But thou haste clearely caste vs of, and mells with vs no more, Thou arte no doubte (Lorde) throughlie chafte, and angerde verye sore. FINIS. EPIGRAMMATA ANTE duos annos conscripta. PRESENTED TO THE QVEENES MAIESTIE BEING THEN at Cambridge, for the name of his degree. A Price, extracte from hautie house, a Prince of pompouse porte Approcheth here, whose auncitours, triumphe in glories forte. Cum noble lustie Poets cum, strike vp in regall rate, To pennes, to pennes, pursue the chase, ye haue a game of state. If, wit maye win a woorthie name, if vertue purchesse praise, If heauenlye hue deserue an hyer, her bruite then let vs blase. Eche Realme, doth boste him of his prince: eache wryter doth aduaunce His soueraigne: then happie we, thryse happie, is our chaunce, To whome the mightie puissaunte God, hath lente a Queene of pryce, Whose fame we iustly maye procure, vnto the cloudes to ryse. What pleasaunte smylinge, twincklynge starres, what goddes of witte so greate, Coulde fynde, for such excellente giftes, in place so small a seate? Well nature well, now maiste thou daunce, and pastyme for a tyme, For neuer shalt thou creature woorke so quyte deuoide of crime. O, maye not we full rightly tearme, that sacred Royall breste, A paradize, where chaste aduice, of godlinesse doth reste? Ye kynges, that rule by seas and lande, and ye infernall ghostes, Beare wytnesse nowe, we haue a Queene, of whome our Ilande bostes. And Cambridge, nowe thou doest inclose, (hye thankes to hym aboue:) A wyght, whome all the worlde adores, And God hymselfe dothe loue. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE and moste noble Lorde, the Lord Robert Dudley, Erle of Leicester. To heare a pleasant penned verse, Augustus tooke delyte: And well allowde, the wittes that could, his prayses well indite. From massie care of common wealthe, ofte woulde he, for a space, Translate him selfe, to interuewe and iudge a Poets grace. Augustus nowe is dead and gone, his fame hath founde her wynges, Of hym, the broode of Pegasse house, and noble Muses synges. If Englande had suche curious wittes, that coulde in stately verse, The factes, the feates of worthy wightes, and royall gestes reherse: Your lordshyps honour, should be made, the myrrour of our tyme, Because you loue to laye your lookes vpon a Poets ryme. Some mountynge wittes, that loue to mount, and soore aloofe in skie, Bothe will and can arreare your fame, and lodge it in the skie, If we be not to rude vnkynde, You and your golden yeares, Wherin you lyue, shall geue assaulte vnto the furthest eares. Not onely we shall liue in you, the daies that you dwell here, Shall shine and shewe to other worldes, in you sette foorthe so clere. A iewell, welcome to the worlde, by whom the worlde shall wynne, And welcome to that happy age, wherein you dyd begynne: Moste hartie welcome vnto vs, on your aduice dothe staye. The pondrous peyse of publique weale, and vrgent weyghtie swaye. In aduentum clariss. viri Thomæ Hennagii Epigramma. If that my penne could paynt my mynde or wyt bewray my wyll: Then shold your worship know my thoughts that lurke for lacke of skyll. I would excuse my rashe attempt, the noblesse of your name, I would sette foorthe in wordes of weyght, and fynely fyled frame: But eloquence she me denyes, she dothe my hande repell: And makes me shrynke to shewe myne arte, to hym where arte dothe dwell. Then blame your selfe, because I doo indyte my mynde in fewe: We simple Poetes, dare not byde, Your heedfull learned vewe. I iustly may mystrust my selfe, that haue a gyltie mynde: And moste mystruste, when he is iudgde, that can the guylt unwynde. I felte a sharpe and harde conflicte, in writynge of this rime: Good wyll prickte on, rudenesse reclamde, great strugglyng for a tyme. But, eche thynge hath at last his ende, aduaunst hym good wyll tho, And shame exilde, he badde me wryte, the victor vrgde me so. That streyght, my base vnspiced style, was subiecte to your syghte, Whiche ought not once to touche your steppes, vnworthy there to lyghte. But geue hym leaue, by gyfte of verse, his meanynge to escrie: Whose handes, to present prouder price, his power dothe denye. And geue me leaue in fyne to saye, thryse welcome to this place Welcome, for shape, welcome for skyll, welcome for ancient race. TO THE DVKES GRACES departynge. Aryse reporte dothe runne abroade, that Fame hath fethered wynges: By healpe wherof, from eare to eare, posthaste the goddesse flinges. An harbynger, oft tymes to wight, to speedie in her flight, She flynges and friskes, through landes and seas, she neuer loues to light. O fame, where dydste thou then soiorne? Inuironde in what place, Waste thou? that we in no wise knewe, the commyng of his grace: His worthie noble princely grace, whose martiall feates of warre, Whose high attemptes, and hardie hande, dothe fraie his foes from farre. If vnderstandyng had ben geuen, yf thou hadste sayd the worde. The Duke shall come, that valiant Duke, That weeldes the wreakefull sworde. No penne, no poet shoulde haue seaste, nexte to the very beste, In trymme attyre, of sundry toungues, his praise we woulde haue dreste. Then beare with vs, (O famous prince) Your commynge was not knowne, Though verses ebbe, yet loue aboundes, our heartes is, all your owne. FINIS.</field>
