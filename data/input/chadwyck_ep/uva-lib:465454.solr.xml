      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES. THE MAGDALENS; A POEM. ADVERTISEMENT. THE MAGDALEN Charity was established in the year 1758. A commodious habitation was engaged, in PRESCOT STREET, by the promoters of this benevolent institution, and the house was opened on the tenth of August, when eight unhappy objects were admitted. In the year 1772, the charity was removed to a more spacious building in ST. GEORGE'S FIELDS. See to you fane the suppliant Nymphs repair, At Virtue's shrine to breathe Contrition's sigh: Their youthful cheek is pal'd with early care, And sorrow dwells in their dejected eye. Hark! they awake a solemn plaintive lay, Where Grief with Harmony delights to meet: Not Philomela from her lonely spray, Trills her clear note more querulously sweet. Are these the fair (late Pleasure's Festive quire) Who wont the dome of Luxury to tread? Who deck'd in varying fashion's new attire, Still vied in splendor with the high-born Maid? For sober weeds they change their flowing train, Of the pearl bracelet strip the graceful arm, Conceal the breast that glow'd in ev'ry vein, And madden'd into joy at Love's alarm. Ah now no more the diamond's dazzling ray Darts from the artful mazes of the hair; No more those tresses garishly display The idle plumes that sportive mock'd the air. Yet Beauty lingers on their mournful brow, As loth to leave the cheek suffus'd with tears, Which scarcely blushing with a languid glow, Like Morn's faint beam thro' gath'ring mist appears. No more compare them to the gaudy flow'r, Whose painted foliage wantons in the gale: They look the lily drooping from the show'r, Or the pale violet sick'ning in the vale. If fond of empire and of conquest vain, They frequent vot'ries to their altars drew, Yet blaz'd those dazz'ling altars to their bane, The idol they, and they the victim too! Once destitute of counsel, aid, or food, Some helpless orphans in this dome reside, Who (like the wand'ring children in the wood) Trod the rude paths of life without a guide. Some who encircled by the great and rich Were won by wiles and deep-designing art, By splendid bribes, and soft persuasive speech, Of pow'r to cheat the young unguarded heart. Some on whom Beauty breath'd her radiant bloom, While adverse stars all other gifts remov'd; Who hurried from the dungeon's living tomb, To scenes their inborn virtue disapprov'd. What tho' their youth imbib'd an early stain, A second innocence is now their claim; While in the precincts of this blesss'd domain, They bask beneath the rays of rising Fame. So the young myrtles in Misfortune's day, Nipt by the blast that swept their vernal bed, In shelt'ring walls their tender leaves display, And wak'ning into life new fragrance shed. Tho' white-wing'd Peace protect this calm abode, Tho' each tumultuous passion be suppress'd, Still Recollection wears a sting to goad, Still Conscience wakes to rob their soul of rest. See one the tort'ring hour of mem'ry prove, Who wrapt in pensive secrecy forlorn, Sits musing on the pledges of her love, Who fell the victims of paternal scorn: Forgot, deserted in th' extremest need, By him who shou'd have rear'd their tender age: ‘Was this, Seducer, this the promis'd meed?’ She cries—then sinks beneath Affliction's rage: Her busy mind recalls the fatal plain, Which with slow lab'ring steps she journey'd o'er, Half-yielding to the fierce impetuous rain, While in her arms two helpless babes she bore: Her mind recalls how at that awful hour The dismal Owlet scream'd her shiv'ring note, How shriek'd the Spirit from the haunted tow'r, While other sounds of woe were heard remote: How to the covert of a tott'ring shed, As Night advanc'd, she fearfully retir'd; And as around the dark'ning horror spread, Her famish'd infants on her breast expir'd: How keenest Anguish bade her bosom bleed, As there she brooded o'er her hapless state: ‘Was this, Seducer, this the promis'd meed?’ She cries—then sinks beneath Affliction's weight. Another mourns her fall with grief sincere. Whom tranquil Reason tells she's shun'd, disdain'd Repuls'd as vile, by those who held her dear, Who call'd her once Companion, Sister, Friend. That recollects the day when lost to shame, She fondly sacrific'd her vestal charms, Resign'd the virgin's for an harlot's name, And left a parent's for a spoiler's arms. Imagination pictures to her mind The father's rage, the mother's softer woe: Unhappy pair! to that distress consign'd, A child can give, a parent only know. At this deep scene, by Fancy drawn, impress'd, The filial passions in her heart revive: Reproach vindictive, rushes on her breast, To Nature's pangs too feelingly alive. If this, or similar tormenting thought, Cling to their soul, when pensively alone, For youth's offence, for Love's alluring fault, Say, do they not sufficiently atone? Nor deem me one of Melancholy's train, If anxious for the sorrow-wedded Fair, Tho' little skilful of that heav'nly strain, Whose melting numbers to the heart repair: I steal impatient from the idle throng, The roving gay companions of my age, This poem was first published in 1763. To temper with their praise my artless song, And soft-ey'd Pity in their cause engage. 'Tis Virtue's task to soothe Affliction's smart, To join in sadness with the Fair distrest: Wake to another's pain the tender heart, And urge to clemency the rigid breast. YARICO TO INKLE. ADVERTISEMENT. INKLE is preparing to set out for England, after having sold YARICO to a merchant at Barbadoes, ‘not withstanding that the poor Girl, (says the Spectator) to incline him to commiserate her condition, told him that she was with child by him: but he only made use of that information, to rise in his demands upon the purchaser.’ With falsehood lurking in thy sordid breast, And perj'ry's seal upon thy heart imprest, Dar'st thou, Oh Christian! brave the sounding waves, The treach'rous whirlwinds, and untrophied graves? Regardless of my woes, securely go, No curse-fraught accents from these lips shall flow: My fondest wish shall catch thy flying sail, Attend thy course, and urge the fav'ring gale: May ev'ry bliss thy God confers be thine, And all thy share of woe compris'd in mine. One humble boon is all I now implore, Allow these feet to print their kindred shore: Give me, Oh Albion's son! again to roam, For thee deserted, my delightful home: To view the groves that deck my native scene, The limpid stream, that graceful glides between: Retrieve the fame I spurn'd at Love's decree, Ascend the throne which I forsook for thee: Approach the bow'r—(why starts th' unbidden tear?) Where once thy Yarico to thee was dear. The scenes the hand of Time has thrown behind, Return impetuous to my busy mind: ‘What hostile vessel quits the roaring tide ‘To harbour here its tempest-beaten side? ‘Behold the beach receives the shipwreck'd crew: ‘Oh mark their strange attire and pallid hue! ‘Are these the Christians, restless sons of pride, ‘By avarice nurtur'd, to deceit allied? ‘Who tread with cunning step the maze of art, ‘And mask with placid looks a canker'd heart? ‘Yet note, superior to the num'rous throng, ‘(E'en as the citron humbler plants among) ‘That Youth!—Lo! beauty on his graceful brow, ‘With nameless charms bids ev'ry feature glow: ‘Ah! leave, fair stranger, this unsocial ground, ‘Where danger broods, and fury stalks around: ‘Behold thy foes advance—my steps pursue ‘To where I'll screen thee from their fatal view: ‘He comes! he comes! th' ambrosial feast prepare, ‘The fig, the palm-juice, nor th' anâna spare: ‘In spacious canisters nor fail to bring ‘The scented foliage of the blushing spring: ‘Ye graceful handmaids, dress the roseat bow'r, ‘And hail with music this auspicious hour— ‘Ah no! forbear—be ev'ry lyre unstrung, ‘More pleasing music warbles from his tongue; ‘Yet utter not to me the lover's vow, ‘All, all is thine that Friendship can bestow: ‘Our laws, my station, check the guilty flame— ‘Why was I born, ye powers, a Nubian dame? ‘Yet see around, at Love's enchanting call, ‘Stern laws submit, and vain distinctions fall: ‘And mortals then enjoy life's transient day, ‘When smit with passion they indulge the sway: ‘Yes! crown'd with bliss, we'll roam the conscious grove, ‘And drink long draughts of unexhausted love: ‘Nor joys alone, thy dangers too I'll share, ‘With thee the menace of the waves I'll dare: ‘In vain—for smiles his brow deep frowns involve, ‘The sacred ties of Gratitude dissolve, ‘See Faith distracted rends her comely hair, ‘His fading vows while tainted zephyrs bear!’ Oh thou, before whose seraph-guarded throne The Christians bow, and other Gods disown, If, wrapt in darkness, thou deny'st thy ray, And shroud'st from Nubia thy celestial day! Indulge this fervent pray'r, to thee address'd, Indulge, tho' utter'd from a sable breast: May gath'ring storms eclipse the chearful skies, And mad'ning furies from thy hell arise: With glaring torches meet his impious brow, And drag him howling to the gulf below!— Ah no! May Heav'n's bright messengers descend, Obey his call, his ev'ry wish attend! Still o'er his form their hov'ring wings display! If he be blest, these pangs admit allay: Me still her mark let angry Fortune deem, So thou may'st walk beneath her cloudless beam. Yet oft to my rapt ear didst thou repeat, That I suffic'd to frame thy bliss compleat. Deluded sex! the dupes of man decreed, We, splendid victims, at his altar bleed. The grateful accents of thy praiseful tongue, Where artful flatt'ry too persuasive hung, Like flow'rs adorn'd the path to my disgrace, And bade Destruction wear a smiling face. Yet form'd by Nature in her choicest mould, While on thy cheek her blushing charms unfold, Who could oppose to thee stern Virtue's shield? What tender virgin would not wish to yield? But pleasure on the wings of Time was born, And I expos'd a prey to tyrant scorn. Of low-born traders—mark the hand of fate!— Is Yarico reduc'd to grace the state, Whose impious parents, an advent'rous band, Imbru'd with guiltless blood my native land: E'en snatch'd my father from his regal seat, And stretch'd him breathless at their hostile feet! Ill-fated prince! The Christians sought thy shore, Unsheath'd the sword, and mercy was no more. But thou, fair stranger, cam'st with gentler mind To shun the perils of the wrecking wind. Amidst thy foes thy safety still I plan'd, And reach'd for galling chains the myrtle band: Nor then unconscious of the secret fire, Each heart voluptuous throb'd with warm desire: Ah pleasing youth, kind object of my care, Companion, Friend, and ev'ry name that's dear! Say, from thy mind canst thou so soon remove The records graven by the hand of Love? How as we wanton'd on the flow'ry ground, The loose-rob'd pleasures danc'd unblam'd around: Till to the sight the growing burden prov'd How thou o'ercam'st—and how, alas! I lov'd! Too fatal proof! since thou with av'rice fraught, Didst basely urge (ah! shun the wounding thought!) That tender circumstance—reveal it not, Lest torn with rage I curse my fated lot: Lest startled Reason abdicate her reign, And Madness revel in this heated brain: That tender circumstance—inhuman part— I will not weep, tho' serpents gnaw this heart: Frail, frail resolve! while gushing from mine eye The pearly drops these boastful words belie. Alas! can Sorrow in this bosom sleep, Where strikes Ingratitude her talons deep? When he whom still I love, to Nature dead, Stabs Pleasure as she mounts the nuptial bed? What time his guardian pow'r I most requir'd, Against my fame and happiness conspir'd! And (do I live to breathe the barb'rous tale?) His faithful Yarico expos'd to sale! Yes, basely urg'd, (regardless of my pray'rs, E'en while I bath'd his venal hand with tears) The tend'rest circumstance—I can no more— My future child—to swell his impious store:— All, all mankind for this will rise thy foe, But I, alas! alone endure the woe: Endure what healing balms can ne'er controul, The heart-lodg'd stings and agony of soul.— Was it for this I left my native plain, And dar'd the tempest brooding on the main? For this unlock'd (seduc'd by Christian art) The chaste affections of my virgin heart? Within this bosom fan'd the constant flame, And fondly languish'd for a Mother's name? Lo! ev'ry hope is poison'd in its bloom, And horrors watch around this guilty womb. With blood illustrious circling thro' these veins, Which ne'er was chequer'd with plebeian stains, Thro' ancestry's long line ennobled springs, From fame-crown'd warriors and exalted kings, Must I the shafts of Infamy sustain? To Slav'ry's purposes my Infant train? To catch the glances of his haughty lord? Attend obedient at the festive board? From hands unscepter'd take the scornful blow? Uproot the thoughts of glory as they grow? Let this pervade at length thy heart of steel; Yet, yet return, nor blush, oh man! to feel: Ah! guide thy steps from yon expecting fleet, Thine injur'd Yarico relenting meet: Bid her recline, woe-stricken, on thy breast, And hush her raging sorrows into rest! If Pity's voice can't wake thy torpid soul, Let Terror her impending thunder roll:— 'Twas night—my solitary couch I press'd, Till sorrow-worn I wearied into rest: Methought—nor was it childish Fancy's flight— My country's Genius stood confess'd to sight: ‘Let Europe's sons (he said) enrich their shore ‘With stones of lustre, and barbaric ore: ‘Adorn their country with their splendid stealth, ‘Unnative foppery, and gorgeous wealth; ‘Embellish still her form with foreign spoils, ‘Till like a gaudy prostitute she smiles: ‘The day, th' avenging day at length shall rise, ‘And tears shall trickle from that harlot's eyes: ‘Her own Gods shall prepare the fatal doom ‘Lodg'd in Time's pregnant and destructive womb: ‘The mischief-bearing womb, these hands shall rend, ‘And straight shall issue forth Confusion's fiend.’ Say, Albion youth, flow all my words in vain, Like seeds that strew the rude ungrateful plain? Say, shall I ne'er regain thy wonted grace? Ne'er stretch these arms to catch the wish'd embrace? Enough—with new-awak'd resentment fraught Assist me, Heav'n! to tear him from my thought: No longer vainly suppliant will I bow, And give to love, what I to hatred owe; Forgetful of the race from whence I came, With woe acquainted, but unknown to shame. Hence, vile Dejection, with thy plaintive pray'r, Thy bended knee, and still descending tear: Rejoin, rejoin the pale-complexion'd train— The conflict's past—and I'm myself again. Thou parent Sun! if e'er with pious lay I usher'd in thy world-reviving ray! Or as thy fainter beams illum'd the west, With grateful voice I hymn'd thee to thy rest! Beheld, with wond'ring eye, thy radiant seat, Or sought thy sacred dome with unclad feet! If near to thy bright altars as I drew, My votive lamb thy holy Flamen slew! Forgive! that I, irrev'rent of thy name, Dar'd for thy foe indulge th' unhallow'd flame: E'en on a Christian lavish'd my esteem, And scorn'd the sable children of thy beam. This poniard, by my daring hand imprest, Shall drink the ruddy drops that warm my breast: Nor I alone, by this immortal deed From Slav'ry's laws my infant shall be freed. And thou, whose ear is deaf to Pity's call, Behold at length thy destin'd victim fall; Behold thy once-lov'd Nubian stain'd with gore, Unwept, extended on the crimson floor: These temples clouded with the shades of death, These lips unconscious of the ling'ring breath: These eyes uprais'd (ere clos'd by Fate's decree) To catch expiring one faint glimpse of thee. Ah! then thy Yarico forbear to dread, My fault'ring voice no longer will upbraid, Demand due vengeance of the pow'rs above, Or, more offensive still, implore thy love. The NUN; or, ADALEIDA to her FRIEND. With each perfection dawning on her mind, All Beauty's treasure op'ning on her cheek: Each flatt'ring hope subdu'd, each wish resign'd, Does gay Ophelia this lone mansion seek? Say, gentle maid, what prompts thee to forsake The paths thy birth and fortune strew with flow'rs? Thro' Nature's kind endearing ties to break, And waste in cloister'd walls thy pensive hours? Let sober thought restrain thine erring zeal, That guides thy footsteps to the vestal gate; Lest thy soft heart (this friendship bids reveal) Like mine unblest, should mourn like mine too late. Does some angelic lonely-whisp'ring voice, Some sacred impulse, or some dream divine, Applaud the dictates of thy early choice?— Approach with confidence the awful shrine. There kneeling at yon altar's marble base, (While tears of rapture from thine eye-lid steal, And smiling Heav'n illumes thy soul with grace) Pronounce the vow thou never can'st repeal. But if misled by false-entitled friends, Who say—‘that Peace with all her comely train, ‘From starry regions to this clime descends, ‘Smooths ev'ry frown, and softens ev'ry pain: ‘That vestals tread Contentment's flow'ry lawn, ‘Approv'd of Innocence, by Health carest: ‘That rob'd in colours of the vernal dawn, ‘Celestial Hope sits smiling at their breast.’ Suspect their syren song and artful style, Their pleasing sounds some treach'rous thought conceal; Full oft does pride with sainted voice beguile, And sordid int'rest wear the mask of zeal. A tyrant abbess here perchance may reign, Who, fond of pow'r, affects th' imperial nod; Looks down disdainful on her female train, And rules the cloister with an iron rod. Reflection sickens at the life-long tie, Back-glancing Mem'ry acts her busy part; Its charm the world unfolds to Fancy's eye, And sheds allurement on the youthful heart. Lo! Discord enters at the sacred porch, Rage in her frown, and terror on her crest: E'en at the hallow'd lamps she lights her torch, And holds it flaming to each virgin breast. But since the legends of monastic bliss, By fraud are fabled, and by youth believ'd; Unbought experience learn from my distress, Oh! mark my lot, and be no more deceiv'd. Three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled, When I was torn from ev'ry weeping friend; A trembling victim to the temple led, And (blush ye parents!) by a father's hand. Yet then what solemn scenes deceiv'd my choice! The pealing organ's animating sound The choral virgins' captivating voice, The blazing altar, and the priests around: The train of youth array'd in purest white, Who scatter'd myrtles as I pass'd along: The thousand lamps that pour'd a flood of light, The kiss of Peace from all the vestal throng; The golden censers toss'd with graceful hand, Whose fragrant breath Arabian odor shed; Of meek-ey'd novices the circling band, With blooming chaplets wreath'd around their head. My willing soul was caught in rapture's flame, While sacred ardor glow'd in ev'ry vein; Methought applauding angels sung my name, And Heav'n's unsullied glories gilt the fane. Methought in sun-beams rob'd the heav'nly spouse Indulg'd the longings of my holy love: Not undelighted heard my virgin vows— While o'er the altar wav'd the mystic dove. This temporary transport soon expir'd, My drooping heart confess'd a dreadful void: Now helpless, heav'n-abandon'd, uninspir'd, I tread this dome, to Misery allied. No wak'ning joy informs my sullen breast, Thro' op'ning skies no radiant seraph smiles; No saint descends to soothe my soul to rest; No dream of bliss the dreary night beguiles. Here haggard Discontent still haunts my view, The umber'd genius reigns in ev'ry place; Arrays each virtue in the darkest hue, Chills ev'ry pray'r and cancels ev'ry grace. I meet her ever in the chearless cell, The gloomy grotto and the awful wood; I hear her ever in the midnight bell, The chiding gale, and hoarse-resounding flood. This caus'd a mother's tender tears to flow, (The sad remembrance time shall ne'er erase) When having seal'd th' irrevocable vow, I hasten'd to receive her last embrace. Yet ne'er did her maternal voice unfold This cloister'd scene in all its horror drest; Nor did she then my trembling steps with-hold, When here I enter'd a reluctant guest. Ah! could she view her only child betray'd And let submission o'er her love prevail? Th' unfeeling priest why did she not upbraid, Forbid the vow, and rend the hov'ring veil? Alas! she might not—her relentless lord Had seal'd her lips, and chid the rising tear; So Anguish in her breast conceal'd its hoard, And all the Mother sunk in dumb despair. But thou who own'st a Father's sacred name, What act impell'd thee to this ruthless deed? What crime had forfeited my filial claim? And giv'n (Oh! blasting thought) thy heart to bleed? If then thine injur'd child deserve thy care, Oh! haste and bear her from this lonesome gloom: In vain—no words can soothe his rigid ear; And iron laws have riveted my doom. Yet let me to my fate submissive bow; From fatal symptoms, if I right conceive, This stream, Ophelia, has not long to flow, This voice to murmur, and this breast to heave. Ah! when extended on th' untimely bier, To yonder vault this form shall be convey'd; Thou'lt not refuse to shed one grateful tear, And breathe the requiem to my fleeting shade. With pious footsteps join the sable train, As thro' the lengthening isle they take their way: A glimmering taper let thy hand sustain, Thy soothing voice attune the funeral lay. Behold the minister who lately gave The sacred veil, in garb of mournful hue, (More friendly office), bending o'er my grave, And sprinkling my remains with hallow'd dew: As o'er the corse he strews the humbling dust, The sternest heart will raise Compassion's sigh; E'en then, no longer to his child unjust, The tears may trickle from a Father's eye. THE NUNNERY. This Poem, which was placed at the end of the volume in the former edition, comes with greater propriety immediately after the Nun: for as there Adaleida foretels her fate, so is her death mentioned in the Nunnery, and marked with some peculiar circumstances, which render the present Poem a supplement to the preceding one. Now pants the night-breeze thro' the darken'd air, And Silence sooths the vestal world to rest, Save where some pale-ey'd novice (rapt in pray'r) Heaves a deep moan, and smites her guiltless breast. Within those ancient walls with moss o'erspread, Where Grief and Innocence their vigils keep, Each in her humble cell till midnight laid, The gentle daughters of Devotion sleep. Of Wantonness the pleasure-breathing lay, Or Laughter beck'ning from his rosy seat, Or Vanity attir'd in colours gay, Shall ne'er allure them from their sober state. Domestic comforts they shall never know, Nor voice of kindred reach their distant ear: Ne'er with a mother's transport shall they glow, While playful children charm the ling'ring year. The various flow'rs in many a wreath they twine, To crown the altar on some festive day; How fervent do they kiss each holy shrine! How thro' the columns streams the choral lay! Let not Ambition mock with jest profane, The life that woos Retreat's obscurest shade, Nor worldly Beauty with a sneer disdain, The humble duties of the cloister'd Maid. The glist'ning eye, the half-seen breast of snow, The coral lip, the blush of Nature's bloom, Awaits alike th' inexorable foe, The paths of Pleasure lead but to the tomb. Perhaps in this drear mansion are confin'd Some bosom form'd to love, unspoil'd by art; Charms that might soften the severest mind, And wake to extacy the coldest heart. Full many a riv'let wand'ring to the main, Sequester'd pours its solitary stream: Full many a lamp devoted to the fane, Sheds unregarded its nocturnal beam. Some uncrown'd Margaret, loit'ring in her cell, By Nature form'd bright Glory's course to run; Here some inglorious Mountagu may dwell, Some Editha Mr. Pope's Mother., unconscious of a son. From Flatt'ry's lip to drink the sweets of praise, In conscious charms with rivals still to vie: In circles to attract the partial gaze, And view their beauty in th' admirer's eye, Their lot forbids: nor does alone remove The thirst of praise, but e'en their crimes restrain: Forbids thro' Folly's labyrinth to rove, And yield to Vanity the flowing rein. To rear 'mid Hymen's joys domestic strife, Or seek that converse which they ought to shun; To loose the sacred ties of nuptial life, And give to many what they vow'd to one. What tho' they're sprinkled with etherial dew! With blooming wreaths by hands of Seraphs crown'd! Tho' Heav'n's unfading splendors burst to view, And harps celestial to their ear resound! Still Recollection prompts the frequent sigh, The chearful scenes of younger days arise; Still to their native home their wishes fly, Affection's stream still gushes from their eyes: For who entranc'd in visions from above, The thought of kindred razes from the mind? Feels in the soul no warm returning love, For some endear'd companion left behind? Their joy-encircled hearth as they forsook, From some fond breast reluctant they withdrew; As from the deck they sent a farewell look, Fair Albion sunk for ever from their view. For thee who mindful of th' encloister'd train, Dost in these lines their mournful tale relate, If by Compassion guided to this fane, Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate: Haply some matron-vestal may reply, “Oft have we heard him, when Light's ling'ring ray “Scarce mark'd its passage thro' the dark'ning sky, “At yonder altar join the vesper-lay. “Where hapless Adaleida sought repose, “Oft at yon grave wou'd he her fate condole! “And in his breast as scenes of grief arose, “He saw ascending slow her spotless soul: Peace to my Edward's heart, the vision said, Ah! not unseen thou shed'st that grateful tear: I wait at night to catch thy wonted tread, And thank thy faithful love that sorrows here. “One eve I miss'd him at the hour divine; “Along that isle, and in the sacristy: “Another came, not yet beside the shrine, “Not at the font, nor in the church was he: “The next we heard the bell of Death intone, “And to his grave we mov'd, a mournful band; “Approach and read, on this sepulchral stone, “These lines, engrav'd by Friendship's holy hand:” EPITAPH. Pause o'er the Youth—nor grudge the short delay Full soon his little history is told— He gave to Solitude the pensive day, And Pity fram'd his bosom of her mould. THE DESERTER. By others blest with genius' rays Let noble acts be told, While I, content with humbler praise, A simple tale unfold: The Spaniard left the hostile plain, To seek his native land, Beneath the sails that swept the main, Cabeysa join'd the band: Who, as he met his country's foes Within the field of Fame, Above his rank obscure arose, And grac'd his humble name: Yet not the early wreath of Fame With haughtiness was twin'd: Nor pride nor fickleness could claim The empire of his mind: The lowly hut, beneath whose roof He sigh'd a sad adieu, Receiv'd him (time and distance-proof) To Love and Laura true: This hamlet-fair, by Fortune scorn'd, Seem'd Nature's fav'rite child, With hand profuse by her adorn'd —The flowret of the wild! Her neat but homely garments press'd The pure, the feeling heart, Oft sought in vain behind the vest Of decorated art: “If sharing all thy cares (she said) “Has paled my beauty's rose, “Ah! know, for thee the heart that bled, “With all its passion glows: “Blest moment, to my wish that gives “The long long absent youth! “He lives—th' endear'd Cabeysa lives, “And Love confirms the truth. “When thy brave comrades fell around, “What Pow'r's benignant care “Secur'd thee from the fatal wound, “And Laura from despair? “Oft in the troubling dream of night “I saw the rushing spear; “Nor did the Morn's awak'ning light “Dispel the ling'ring fear.” “Thy tender fears (the youth replied) “Ah give them to the air! “To happiness we're now allied, “And pleasure be our care: “Let us pursue the joy begun, “Nor lose by dull delay: “Say, Laura, shall to-morrow's sun “Illume our nuptial day?” With look declin'd she blush'd consent— Reserve that takes alarm, And Love and Joy their influence lent To raise meek Beauty's charm. The guests, to hail the wedded pair, Beneath their roof repair'd; With them the little feast to share Their scanty purse prepar'd: Tho' no delicious wines were pour'd, Mirth took his destin'd place, The handmaid Neatness spread the board, And sage Content said grace. Scarce thro' one hasty week had Love His grateful blessings shed, When bliss (as flies the frighted dove) Their humble mansion fled: 'Twas at Bellona's voice it flew, That call'd to War's alarms: Bad the youth rise, to valor true, And break from Laura's arms: But she still strain'd him to her heart, To lengthen the adieu: “Ah what, (she said) should'st thou depart, “Shall I and Sorrow do? “Say, valiant youth, when thou'rt away “Who'll raise my drooping head? “How shall I chase the fears that say “Thy lov'd Cabeysa's dead? “With thine my fate I now involve, “Intent thy course to steer; “No words shall shake my firm resolve, “Not e'en that trickling tear.” “Fram'd for each scene of soft delight, “(He said) thy gentle form, “As shrinks the lily at the blight, “Will droop beneath the storm.” “Blest in thy presence! ev'ry pain “(She added) brings its charm, “And Love, tho' falls the beating rain, “Will keep this bosom warm.” E'en as the wall-flow'r rears its head, 'Mid ruins, wrecks, and tombs, So 'mid the woes around that spread, True Love unconquer'd blooms. Her zeal (the supplement of strength) Upheld her many a day, But Nature's pow'rs subdued at length, On Sickness' couch she lay: Three painful days unseen she lay Of him she held so dear: “Ah! does he thus my love repay?” She said—and dropt a tear: “Cabeysa, at a league's remove, “Dwells on the tent-spread hill: “Ah! wherefore did he vow true love, “And not that vow fulfil?” Yet not deficiency of truth Forbad to yield relief, Stern pow'r with-held the tender youth, And duty to his chief: Who, wisely counsel'd, drew a line To check the hand of Stealth, That ravag'd wide th' encircling vine, The humble peasant's wealth: To pass the line, it was ordain'd, Whoever should presume, Should a Deserter be arraign'd, And meet the coward's doom. This law, by Equity approv'd, And to the peasant dear, Soon to the brave Cabeysa prov'd Destructively severe: Now Laura's image haunts his soul, In Woe's dark tints array'd: While to his breast Compassion stole, And all her claims display'd: “For me her native home, (he said) “For me each weeping friend, “For me a Father's arms she fled— “And shall not Love attend? “Say for a chosen lover's sake, “What more cou'd woman do? “And now that Health and Peace forsake, “Shall I forsake her too? “Now stretch'd upon the naked ground, “Oppress'd with pain and fear, “She casts a languid eye around, “Nor sees Cabeysa near: “Now, now she weeps at my delay, “And shall neglect be mine? “Submit, ye fears, to Pity's sway:” He spoke—and cross'd the line. Soon at his sight the fair resum'd Each captivating grace: On her pale cheek the rose re-bloom'd, And smiles illum'd her face. Yet to that cheek return'd in vain Bright Health's vermilion dye, For bitter tears that cheek shall stain, And dim her brilliant eye: The youth returning thro' the gloom, At Midnight's secret hour, Was seiz'd—and to Dishonour's tomb Doom'd by the martial pow'r. To meet his fate at wake of day (Love's victim) he was led: No weakness did his cheek betray, While to the chief he said, “If in the battle death I've dar'd, “In all its horror drest, “Think not this scene, by thee prepar'd, “Sheds terror on my breast: “Yet then at Laura's hapless fate, “My fortitude impairs, “Unmann'd I sink beneath the weight “Of her oppressive cares: “Ah! when her grief-torn heart shall bleed, “Some little solace grant, “Oh! guard her in the hour of need “From the rude hand of Want!” Now, kneeling on the fatal spot, He twin'd the dark'ning band: The twelve, who drew th' unwelcome lot, Reluctant took their stand: And now the murm'ring throng grew dumb, 'Twas silence all—save where, At intervals, the sullen drum Struck horror on the ear: Now, with their death-fraught tubes up-rear'd, The destin'd twelve were seen— And now th' explosion dire was heard That clos'd Cabeysa's scene. Another scene remain'd behind For Laura to supply— She comes! mark how her tortur'd mind Speaks thro' th' expressive eye: “Forbear—will ye in blood (she said) “Your cruel hands imbrue? “On me, on me your vengeance shed, “To me alone 'tis due: “Relent—and to these arms again “The valiant youth restore. “I rave—already on the plain “He welters in his gore.” Advancing now, she pierc'd the crowd, And reach'd the fatal place, Where, listing from the corse the shroud, No semblance could she trace. “Is this—oh blasting view! (she cried) “The youth who lov'd too well? “His love for me the law defied, “And for that love he fell! “When will the grave this form receive?— “Prepare the mutual tomb; “There, only there, I'll cease to grieve, “There cease to curse my doom.” Now, conquer'd by Affection's force, Which broke her heart in twain, She sunk upon the bleeding corse, And never rose again. IL LATTE. Incipe, parue puer, risu cognoscere matrem. Ye Fair, for whom the hands of Hymen weave The nuptial wreath to deck your virgin brow, While pleasing pains the conscious bosom heave, And on the kindling cheek the blushes glow: Whose spotless soul contains the better dow'r, Whose life unstain'd full many virtues vouch, For whom now Venus frames the fragrant bow'r, And scatters roses o'er the destin'd couch: To you I sing.—Ah! ere the raptur'd youth With trembling hand removes the jealous veil, Where, long regardless of the vows of truth, Unsocial coyness stamp'd th' ungrateful seal: Allow the poet round your flowing hair, Cull'd from an humble vale, a wreath to twine, To Beauty's altar with the Loves repair, And wake the lute beside that living shrine: That sacred shrine! where female virtue glows, To which retreat the warm affections fly; Where Love is born, where strong attachment grows, Where frames pure Constancy the faithful tye. That shrine! where Nature with presaging aim, What time her friendly aid Lucina brings, The snowy nectar pours, delightful stream! Where flutt'ring Cupids dip their purple wings: For you who bear a Mother's sacred name, Whose cradled offspring, in lamenting strain, With artless eloquence asserts his claim, The boon of Nature, but asserts in vain: Say why, illustrious daughters of the Great, Lives not the nursling at your tender breast? By you protected in his frail estate? By you attended, and by you caress'd? To venal hands, alas! can you resign The Parent's task, the Mother's pleasing care? To venal hands the smiling babe consign? While Hymen starts, and Nature drops a tear. When 'mid the polish'd circle ye rejoice, Or roving join fantastic Pleasure's train, Unheard perchance the nursling lifts his voice, His tears unnotic'd, and unsooth'd his pain. Ah! what avails the coral crown'd with gold? In heedless infancy the title vain? The colours gay the purfled scarfs unfold? The splendid nurs'ry, and th' attendant train? Far better hadst thou first beheld the light Beneath the rafter of some roof obscure; There in a Mother's eye to read delight, And in her cradling arm repose secure.— Nor wonder, should Hygeia, blissful Queen! Her wonted salutary gifts recall, While haggard Pain applies his dagger keen, And o'er the cradle Death unfolds his pall. The flow'ret ravish'd from its native air, And bid to flourish in a foreign vale, Does it not oft elude the planter's care, And breathe its dying odors on the gale? For you, ye plighted fair, when Hymen crowns With tender offspring your unshaken love, Behold them not with Rigor's chilling frowns, Nor from your sight unfeelingly remove. Unsway'd by Fashion's dull unseemly jest, Still to the bosom let your infant cling, There banquet oft, an ever-welcome guest, Unblam'd inebriate at that healthful spring. With fond solicitude each pain assuage, Explain the look, awake the ready smile; Unfeign'd attachment so shall you engage, To crown with gratitude maternal toil: So shall your daughters, in Affliction's day, When o'er your form the gloom of age shall spread, With lenient converse chase the hours away, And smooth with Duty's hand the widow'd bed: Approach, compassionate, the voice of Grief, And whisper patience to the closing ear; From Comfort's chalice minister relief, And in the potion drop a filial tear. So shall your sons, when beauty's charms are fled, When fades the languid lustre in your eye; When Flattery shuns her Hybla-drops to shed, The want of beauty, and of praise, supply: E'en from the wreath that decks the warrior's brow, Some chosen leaves your peaceful walks shall strew: And e'en the flow'rs on classic ground that blow, Shall all unfold their choicest sweets for you. When to th' embattled host the trumpet blows, While at the call fair Albion's gallant train Dare to the field their triple-number'd foes, And chase them speeding o'er the martial plain: The mother kindles at the glorious thought, And to her son's renown adjoins her name; For at the nurt'ring breast the Hero caught The love of Virtue, and the love of Fame. Or in the senate, when Britannia's cause With gen'rous themes inspires the glowing mind, While list'ning Freedom grateful looks applause, Pale Slav'ry drops her chain, and sculks behind: With conscious joy the tender parent fraught, Still to her son's renown adjoins her name; For at the nurt'ring breast the Patriot caught The love of Virtue, and the love of Fame: Yet then, ascending still with bolder view, Should the blest youth to heav'nly gifts aspire, While with keen eye he pierces nature through, And his proud bosom owns a Muse of fire: The Mother yields to Glory's soaring thought, And darts of thrilling transport touch her frame; For at the nurt'ring breast the Poet caught The love of Virtue, and the love of Fame. MATILDA. Où sont les entrailles, les cris, les emotions puissantes de la Nature?—C'est dans l'ame brulante et passionnée des Meres. Essai sur les Femmes. Outrageous did the loud wind blow Across the sounding main: The vessel tossing to and fro, Could scarce the storm sustain. Matilda to her fearful breast Held close her infant dear; His presence all her fears increas'd, And wak'd the tender tear. Now nearer to the grateful shore The shatter'd vessel drew: The daring waves now ceas'd to roar, Now shout th' exulting crew. Matilda, with a Mother's joy, Gave thanks to Heaven's pow'r: How fervent she embrac'd her boy! How blest the saving hour! Oh! much deceiv'd and hapless fair, Tho' ceas'd the waves to roar, Thou, from that fatal moment, ne'er Didst taste of pleasure more: For, stepping forth from off the deck, To reach the welcome ground, The Babe, unclasping from her neck, Plung'd in the gulph profound. Amazement-chain'd! her haggard eye Gave not a tear to flow, Her bosom heav'd no conscious sigh, She stood a sculptur'd woe. To snatch the child from instant death, Some brav'd the threat'ning main, And to recall his fleeting breath Try'd ev'ry art in vain. But when the corse first met her view, Stretch'd on the pebbly strand, Rous'd from her ecstacy she flew, And pierc'd th' opposing band. With tresses discompos'd and rude, Fell prostrate on the ground, To th' infant's lips her lips she glew'd, And Sorrow burst its bound. Now throwing round a troubled glance, With Madness' ray inflam'd, And, breaking from her silent trance, She wildly thus exclaim'd: “Heard ye the helpless infant scream? “Saw ye the mother bold? “How, as she flung him in the stream, “The billows o'er him roll'd? “But soft, awhile—see! there he lies, “Embalm'd in infant sleep: “Why fall the dew-drops from your eyes? “What cause is here to weep? “Yes, yes—his little life is fled, “His heaveless breast is cold: “What tears will not thy Mother shed, “When thy sad tale is told! “Ah me! that cheek of livid hue— “That brow—that auburn hair— “Those lips where late the roses blew, “All, all my Son declare. “Strange thrilling horrors chill each vein— “A voice in accents wild “Thunders to this distracted brain, “Matilda slew her child!” She added not—but sunk oppress'd— Death on her eye-lids stole While from her grief-distracted breast She sigh'd her tortur'd soul. THE SWEDISH CURATE, A POEM. ADVERTISEMENT. CHRISTIERN the Second, king of Denmark, offered to appear in person at Stockholm, to frame a treaty of peace, provided GUSTAVUS VASA remained a hostage on board the Danish fleet. The king having by the stratagem secured the illustrious Swede, forcibly carried him away to Denmark, where he was imprisoned for a considerable time. GUSTAVUS at length found means of escaping from his confinement; and travelling through Sweden in diguise, was received by SUVERDSIO, a poor country curate, who, at the hazard of his life, concealed him in the parish church, and informed him of every thing that had happened in Sweden during his absence, particularly of the massacre of the senate at Stockholm, in which the father of GUSTAVUS was included. Beneath the friendly veil that midnight spread, Gustavus to the patriot Priest was led, An humble, plain, disinterested man, Who rear'd his useful life on Virtue's plan: Pleas'd to behold, entrusted to his care, The hopes of Sweden, and fair Freedom's heir; Lest hostile steps should their abode invade, He to Religion's dome the Chief convey'd: There unrestrain'd he gladly own'd his guest, And yielded to the zeal that fir'd his breast. “Beneath yon hallow'd lamp's resplendent light, “Which glows a brilliant on the breast of Night. “Let me thy long-lost image now survey, “And grateful homage to Gustavus pay: “Oppress'd, o'erthrown at Christiern's dire decree, “Unhappy Sweden still looks up to thee.” “Dost thou with honest and indignant zeal, The Hero answer'd, “speak of Sweden's weal? “Lament the ills the Danish hands achieve? “Or dost thou flatter only to deceive? “Then be it so—call forth thy murd'ring train, “And summon to my bier the cruel Dane; “Thus to Preferment's summit shalt thou rise, “And catch the hov'ring mitre for thy prize.” “Misjudging Youth!” the sacred Seer replied, “Suppress th' injurious doubt, and still confide: “Tho' indigent I stand! yet far above “The hov'ring mitre is my country's love: “Let others to the gilded cross aspire, “And from the crozier catch Ambition's fire, “And as they bask in Leo's fost'ring ray, “Their wealth, their pride, their pageantry display: “Let me, by grandeur undisturb'd, unseen, “Content inspher'd in Duty's humbler scene, “Sequester'd lead my unaspiring days, “And quench at Virtue's fount the thirst of praise; “Be mine to dwell amidst the village swains, “Survey their pleasures, and partake their pains, “Still to their wants unfold my little store, “And place Contentment at the cottage-door. “Ah! deem me then no longer Falshood's son, “(By some dishonest meed's allurement won) “Prompt to surprise thee with ignoble art, “And thro' thy bosom pierce my country's heart. “Avert it, Heav'n!—Shall on this hallow'd ground, “Where all Religion's terrors breathe around, “Say, shall Venality, with artful mien, “Dare to profane this venerable scene? “—Yon distant altar, dress'd in simple guise, “Which seems from out th' encircling tombs to rise, “From whose dread base at each returning day, “While o'er the world ten lustres roll'd away, “I've sent to Heav'n, upon the wings of pray'r, “The hamlet's homage and the hamlet's care, “Shall ne'er behold me tott'ring o'er my grave, “False to my country, treach'rous to the brave.” The Chief, convinc'd, replies—“Oh! virtuous Seer, “Thy firm intrepid zeal I now revere: “That honour-breathing voice, those silver hairs, “That candid brow, engrav'd with Wisdom's cares, “All strike my soul with Truth's unclouded ray, “Before whose warmth Suspicion melts away.” “Thrice happy hour!” th' exulting Pastor said, “Let injur'd Sweden raise her drooping head, “For lo! her godlike Hero comes to save “Her laws, her rights, her freedom from the grave. “—Urg'd in thy absence by intruding fears, “We thought thee dead, and bath'd that thought in tears.” “My death,” the Chief return'd, “the Dane decreed, “But fear, the tyrant's curse, forbade the deed: “Yet then the monarch spread his treach'rous sails, “And by the favor of conspiring gales, “Convey'd me on his rapid bark away, “To his intrusted faith an helpless prey: “Canst thou conceive the pangs that stung my breast, “I who to Fame my ardent vows address'd, “When for th' unblemish'd lustre of renown, “That plays encircling on young Valour's crown, “Condemn'd by Fortune's inauspicious doom, “These eyes were blasted with a prison's gloom? “In ev'ry plan, in all my wishes cross'd, “These arms, my zeal, my youth to Sweden lost. “But Heav'n, that watches with paternal care “The blameless suff'rer, rais'd me from despair, “Gave to my longing hopes the welcome hour, “Decreed to snatch me from the Danish pow'r: “Yet then new Sorrows did my path pursue, “In scenes presented to my mournful view: “Still as I wander'd o'er my native land, “I mark'd the ravage of a tyrant's hand: “Rich Industry had fled the naked plains, “To Slav'ry's banners march'd th' unwilling swains: “Each lofty seat that crown'd the mountain's brow, “And frown'd defiance on th' invading foe, “Spoil'd of its honours, desolate, disgrac'd, “Its turrets fall'n, its battlements defac'd! “Seem'd to the pensive traveller to say, “Behold the dire effect of lawless sway! “The dreary scene unequal to sustain, “I sigh'd—and languish'd for my chains again: “Yet other ills, perchance, I've still to know, “Perchance Gustavus feels but half his woe. “Averse to walk beneath the eye of day, “Oft thro' the night I urg'd my lonely way; “Where'er I went my name I still suppress'd, “And lock'd each bold enquiry in my breast.” The Priest renew'd, “Heart-wounded I unveil, “Replete with Sweden's woes, the cover'd tale: “The barb'rous scene now rip'ning into fate, “The Danish King unbarr'd Destruction's gate Alluding to the massacre of the senate at Stockholm.: “Stern Tyranny thro' trembling Stockholm bore “Her tort'ring wheel, and axes stain'd with gore: “While at her side a captive train appear'd— “Illustrious train! by Liberty rever'd: “Still as they pass'd, they heard around them rise “The people's loud laments and piercing cries: “These eyes beheld (and do I live to tell?) “How firm to Truth these patriot martyrs fell. “First on the scaffold, proud to lead the way “To honour'd death from ignominious day, “Appear'd—Ah! let me not that scene disclose, “And pour upon thy soul a flood of woes: “Here will I pause—yet wherefore thus conceal “What babbling Fame will soon to thee reveal? “Oh! summon all thy fortitude of heart, “For I must wound it in the tend'rest part: “He on the tragic scene who first appear'd, “To meet the bloody axe that Christiern rear'd, “Unblam'd through life, a venerable Seer, “For whom now gushes this unbidden tear, “Who Virtue's steep ascent unrivall'd won, “Rever'd, regretted, call'd Gustavus son!” Th' astonish'd Hero, at his words oppress'd, Like Sorrow's image stands with voice suppress'd: The Priest, unequal to dispense relief, Stood at his side, enwrapp'd in silent grief. —Now breaking from the chains Affliction fram'd, And bursting into voice, the Youth exclaim'd: “Oh injur'd spirit of my Father, hear! “By yon dread altar, and these shrines, I swear, “The base inhuman Dane the day shall rue “He dar'd the scaffold with thy blood imbrue: “A monitor within, to which I yield, “Stirs and impels me to th' avenging field.” He said—a deeper darkness seem'd to reign, A hollow wind ran murm'ring thro' the fane, When lo! ascending from the realms of Night, An awe-commanding spectre rush'd to sight: Around his temples seem'd the civic wreath, And thus prophetic spoke the Son of Death: “Arise to vindicate the sacred laws, “Revenge thy father's and thy country's cause: “Arise! to Mora's distant field repair, “Where Freedom's banners catch the playful air; “Beneath whose shade for thee impatient stand, “Prepar'd to combat, an intrepid band: “But whether in the bold ensanguin'd strife “Thou shalt or forfeit or prolong thy life— “Thy foes shall fall—This to thy knowledge giv'n, “The rest lies buried in the breast of Heav'n: “Still let my wrongs support thee in the fight”— He ceas'd—and instant vanish'd into night. The Pastor spoke—“Go forth, illustrious Chief, “At Heav'n's commandment, to the realm's relief: “Yet then indulge me in this bold request, “Say, is each meaner thought subdu'd to rest? “Say, in this solemn and important hour, “Glows not thy bosom with the lust of pow'r?” “Not all the radiant sun-beams of renown, “Nor yet the dazzling lustre of a crown, “Shall e'er,” the Youth replies, “this heart control: “—My country's love possesses all my soul. “E'en as the bird that from its ashes springs, “And soars aloft upon exulting wings, “So does my country's love its birth assume, “And mount triumphant from the passions' tomb. “But should I view, unnumber'd with the slain, “'Tis all I ask, fair Freedom's future reign, “Then from my gratitude thy voice shall claim “All that thy want or fondest wish can frame.” “No splendid gifts,” the virtuous man rejoin'd, “Have pow'r to move the duty-center'd mind: “Yet would thy gratitude my love secure, “Then be, Oh Chief! a father to the poor:— “Illustrious offspring of an honour'd race, “Allow my warm attachment this embrace.” He spoke—and, with a love devoid of art, He press'd Gustavus to his feeling heart. Now, breaking from the Youth's encircling arms, Resign'd him to his fate and War's alarms: Then to the sacred altar he repair'd, And thus aloud his ardent vows preferr'd: “Oh Thou that liv'st enshrin'd from mortal eye, “Look down indulgent from thy sacred sky, “See the bold Youth to valor's impulse yield, “See, see him hast'ning to th' embattled field! “—On Freedom's brow be his the wreath to twine! “To see that happy glorious day be mine!” He added not—Heav'n granted half his pray'r, The rest was scatter'd to th' abortive air. Scarce had the Chief commenc'd his bold career, When slept the Curate on the peaceful bier: There heav'd the village swain the sigh profound, There stood the grateful poor lamenting round. Thus mourn'd, thus honour'd, fell the hallow'd sage, A bright example to each future age! The hamlet, jealous of her Pastor's fame, Adorn'd her simple annals with his name. THE FUNERAL OF ARABERT, MONK OF LA TRAPPE, A POEM. ADVERTISEMENT. ARABERT, a young ecclesiastic, retired to the convent of LA TRAPPE, in obedience to a vow he had taken during a fit of illness: LEONORA, with whom he had lived in the strictest intimacy, followed her lover, and by the means of a disguise, obtained admission into the monastery, where a few day after she assisted at her lover's Funeral. Fair Leonora, by Affliction led, Sought the dread dome where sleep the hallow'd dead: The solemn edifice was wrapt around In midnight darkness, and in peace profound: A solitary lamp, with languid light, Serv'd not to chase, but to disclose the night; Serv'd to disclose (the source of all her pains) The tomb that gap'd for Arabert's remains: To this, she sent the deep, the frequent sigh, And spoke—the warm tear rushing from her eye. ‘Doom'd to receive all that my soul holds dear, ‘Give him that rest his heart refus'd him here: ‘Oh! screen him from the pain the tender know, ‘The train of sorrows that from passion flow! ‘And to his happier envied state adjoin, ‘(Or all is vain) an ignorance of mine.’ As thus she mourn'd, an aged priest drew near, (Whose pure life glided as the riv'let clear) The virtuous Anselm.—Tho' in cloisters bred, Still bright-ey'd Wisdom to his cell he led: From paths of sophistry he lov'd to stray, To tread the walk where Nature led the way. The Prior's rank he long had held approv'd, Esteem'd, rever'd, and as a parent lov'd: Unskilful in the jargon of the schools, He knew Humanity's diviner rules; To others gentle, to himself severe, On Sorrow's wound he dropt the healing tear. In all the negligence of grief, he found The fair extended on the naked ground. Touch'd at her woe, the sacred Father said, ‘Well may'st thou droop if Happiness be fled: ‘Sure, if at holy Arabert's decease, ‘Impetuous sorrows rush upon thy peace, ‘Some much-lov'd friend in him you must deplore, ‘Or, dearer still, a brother is no more: ‘Yet, as thro' life our weary steps we bend, ‘Let us not sink when beating storms descend: ‘Still let Religion hold unrival'd sway, ‘And Patience walk companion of our way. ‘Ah, lose not sight of that delightful shore, ‘Whose blissful bow'rs shall friends to friends restore! ‘Tho' here Misfortune comes to blast our will, ‘The Heav'ns are just, and God a Father still.’ ‘Blest be the voice,’ the rising mourner said, ‘That bids Affliction raise her drooping head: ‘That bids me hope (beyond e'en Death's domain) ‘These eyes shall banquet on my love again. ‘Ah, start not, Anselm—for, to truth allied, ‘Impiety now throws her mask aside: ‘No holy Monk, by Contemplation led ‘To these sequester'd mansions of the dead; ‘No Youth devoted to Religion's pow'r, ‘Implores thy pity at this awful hour.— ‘The guilty secret I'll at length unfold— ‘In me—(forgive!) a woman you behold. ‘—Ah, fly me not! let Mercy now prevail, ‘And deign to mark my sad disast'rous tale. ‘Known to Misfortune from my tender years, ‘My parents' ashes drank my early tears: ‘A barb'rous uncle, to each vice allied, ‘The office of a parent ill supplied: ‘Of my entire inheritance possess'd, ‘By lucre prompted, and by fortune blest, ‘He pass'd the ocean never to return, ‘And left me weeping o'er my parents' urn: ‘Then Arabert, the gen'rous stranger, came, ‘To soothe my sorrows, and relieve my shame: ‘Beneath his tender care my woes decreas'd, ‘More than Religion's, he was Pity's priest: ‘To reach his bounty my affection strove, ‘Till gratitude was heighten'd into love: ‘Nor he at length refus'd the lover's part, ‘The pity that adorn'd, betray'd his heart. ‘How ardently he wish'd the nuptial rite ‘In holy wedlock might our hands unite! ‘But stern Religion at our vows exclaim'd, ‘And tore the bands that Love and Nature fram'd: ‘For then devoted to her hallow'd shrine, ‘His country's laws forbade him to be mine. ‘Tho' from my mind each flatt'ring thought retir'd, ‘And in my bosom Hope and Peace expir'd; ‘Yet on their ruins Love triumphant rose: ‘Enough—shame o'er the rest a mantle throws: ‘At length Remorse effac'd the guilty scene, ‘And to his breast apply'd her dagger keen; ‘Restrain'd in full career the erring youth, ‘And led him back to Innocence and Truth: ‘'Twas then he fled (divorc'd from Pleasure's chain) ‘To woo Religion in this gloomy fane: ‘Yet ere he fled, my bliss he fondly plann'd, ‘And scatter'd riches with a lavish hand: ‘Ah, what to me avail'd the golden store? ‘The giver gone, the gift could charm no more. ‘While in the gloom his tedious absence cast, ‘My former life in fancy I repass'd, ‘Repentance gain'd admission to my breast, ‘Nor did it enter an unwelcome guest: ‘For ne'er to Pleasure I dismiss'd the rein ‘Free and unconscious of Reflection's pain; ‘If hapless Leonora lov'd too well, ‘Content, fair Virtue's friend, with Virtue fell: ‘But not my stubborn soul could pray'r subdue, ‘E'en grafted on remorse my passion grew; ‘Too fatal passion—by its impulse led, ‘In man's attire to this retreat I fled: ‘Yet then, e'en then to bashful Fear allied, ‘Still o'er my Love did Modesty preside. ‘In those calm moments that precede the night, ‘When peaceful Nature wears a soften'd light, ‘I met the Youth within the solemn grove, ‘(His frequent walk) absorb'd in heav'nly love: ‘By warm occasion eagerly impell'd, ‘A sudden fear my ready steps withheld: ‘While God and he employ the trembling scene, ‘'Twere sacrilege, I cried, to rush between: ‘Still from that hour my wishes I restrain'd, ‘And in my breast th' unwilling secret chain'd; ‘Unknown to him, yet half-content I grew, ‘So that his form might daily charm my view. ‘But new Affliction, with relentless hand, ‘O'erthrew the project that my heart had plann'd; ‘Amid the horrors of the lonesome night, ‘A ghastly spectre rush'd upon my sight, ‘And pour'd these accents on my trembling ear, ‘Think not Impiety shall triumph here: ‘Thy hopes are blasted—Death's tremendous bell ‘Shall sound, ere many hours, thy lover's knell: ‘I started from my couch, with fright impress'd, ‘Flew to the fane to calm my anxious breast, ‘By love then prompted—yet by love dismay'd, ‘The peopled choir I tremblingly survey'd; ‘Sill 'mid th' innumerous monastic train, ‘These eyes solicited his form in vain: ‘Nor in the field or pensive grove retir'd ‘Could I discover whom my heart requir'd: ‘Then sure (I cried) at this unhappy hour ‘Does Anguish o'er his cell diffuse its pow'r: ‘Shall Leonora not relieve his pain, ‘And with these arms his drooping head sustain? ‘Say, near the couch, when Death is stalking round, ‘Shall not the spouse of his fond heart be found? ‘Ah no—th' affection that subdues me still, ‘At that dread moment check'd my ardent will, ‘Lest rushing on his sight I should controul ‘The holy thoughts that hover'd o'er his soul. ‘This low'ring morn disclos'd the fatal truth: ‘Oh early lost—oh lov'd—oh hapless youth— ‘Fix'd to the column of the hallow'd porch— ‘'Twas scarcely light—some Fury lent her torch— ‘I read— The pious Arabert's no more, The peace the dead require, for him implore: ‘Let peace, let joy, (I said) his spirit join, ‘Nor joy nor peace must e'er encircle mine. ‘Lamented Youth! too tenderly allied, ‘In vain you fled me, and in vain you died; ‘Still to your image, which this breast inurns, ‘My constant heart a lamp perpetual burns. ‘But thou, to whom as friend he did impart ‘Each latent wish and foible of the heart; ‘For well I know, where Sorrow drops a tear, ‘Or Misery complains, thou still art near; ‘Ah say, by love did my known image drest, ‘Come to his mind thus welcome, thus carest? ‘Or on his soul come rushing undesir'd, ‘The fatal fair, by female arts inspir'd, ‘Who dimm'd the lustre of his radiant name, ‘And from his temples tore the flow'r of fame; ‘Who thro' the winding maze of Pleasure's bow'r ‘Allur'd (for beauty such as mine had pow'r) ‘E'en to the dang'rous steep—and cast him down ‘From high repute to grov'ling disrenown?— ‘Wretch that I am, to my distressful state ‘There wanted not th' addition of his hate: ‘For him I plung'd my artless youth in shame, ‘Unlock'd reserve, and sacrific'd my fame: ‘Still, still I fear (unable to confide,) ‘Before my Arabert, the lover died: ‘This thought (to thee I'll own) suspends my grief, ‘While cold Indifference comes to my relief: ‘Say, virtuous Anselm, if this thought be vain, ‘And give, Oh give me all my grief again!’ To her reply'd the pity-breathing seer, ‘Mark well my words, and lose thy idle fear: ‘When on the couch of Death the victim lay, ‘Not in that moment was his friend away: ‘As at his side I took my mournful stand, ‘With feeble grasp he seiz'd my offer'd hand, ‘And thus began:—“The fatal dart is sped, “Soon, soon shall Arabert encrease the dead: “'Tis well—for what can added life bestow, “But days returning still with added woe? “Say, have I not secluded from my sight “The lovely object of my past delight? “Ah, had I too dethron'd her from my mind, “When here the holy brotherhood I join'd, “Remorse would not, encreasing my disease, “Prey on my soul, and rob it of its ease: “And yet I strove, unequal to the part, “Weak to perform the sacrifice of heart: “And now, e'en now, too feeble to controul, “I feel her clinging to my parting soul.” ‘He spoke—(my sympathetic bosom bled) ‘And to the realms of Death his spirit fled.’ The fair rejoin'd: ‘Misled by foul distrust, ‘To him, whose heart was mine, am I unjust? ‘Ah, Arabert, th' unwilling fault forgive, ‘Dead to th' alluring world, in thee I live: ‘My thoughts, my deep regret, my sorrows own, ‘No view, no object still but thee alone: ‘At all the vengeance bursting from above, ‘Alarm'd, I weep, I shudder, yet I love.’ As thus she spoke, the death-bell smote her ear, While to the porch the fun'ral train drew near: Ah, Leonore, in that tremendous hour, Didst thou not feel all Heav'n's avenging pow'r, When moving thro' the isle the choral band, And vested priests, with torches in their hand, Gave to thy view, unfortunately dear, Thy lover sleeping on th' untimely bier? Collecting now at length her scatter'd force, With trembling footsteps she approach'd the corse, And, while she check'd the conflict in her breast, The wide-encircling throng she thus address'd: ‘Well may ye mark me with astonish'd eyes, ‘Audacious hypocrite in man's disguise; ‘Who, urg'd by passion, dar'd with steps profane ‘Approach the hallow'd dome of Virtue's train: ‘Lead me, ah lead me, to the dungeon's gloom, ‘The rack prepare—I yield me to your doom: ‘Yet still should Pity in your breast abide, ‘And Pity sure to Virtue is allied, ‘To my distress benign attention lend, ‘Your acts of rigor for a while suspend, ‘Till o'er this bier ('tis Nature's kind relief) ‘I've pour'd my plaints, and paid the rites of Grief: ‘Ah! he was dearer to this bleeding heart, ‘Far dearer than expression can impart. ‘Thou who didst place us in this vale of tears, ‘Where Sorrow blasts the plant that Pleasure rears; ‘If, as the tenets of our creed require, ‘Thy waken'd justice breathe immortal ire; ‘If Love, from whence e'en here misfortunes flow, ‘Beyond the grave is curs'd with endless woe: ‘Ah! not on Arabert thy vengeance pour! ‘On me, on me thy storm of anger show'r! ‘For I allur'd him far from Virtue's way, ‘And led his youthful innocence astray: ‘Ah! not in punishment our fate conjoin, ‘He shar'd the rapture, but the guilt was mine.’ With trembling hand she now the veil withdrew, 'Tis usual to bury the monks of La Trappe in their monastic habit, extended on a plank. When lo, the well known features struck her view: Absorpt in grief she cast a fond survey— At length her thougths in murmurs broke away: ‘That eye—which shed on mine voluptuous light, ‘Alas! how sunk in everlasting night! ‘See from those lips the living colour fled, ‘Where Love resided, and where Pleasure fed! ‘And where bright Eloquence had pour'd her store ‘Dumb Horror sits—and Wisdom is no more: ‘Yet ere the worm (since this is doom'd its prey) ‘Shall steal the ling'ring likeness quite away, ‘On that cold lip sure Leonore may dwell, ‘And, free from guilt, imprint the long farewel:’ She added not—but bending low her head, Three times the mourner kiss'd th' unconscious dead. Now holy Anselm urg'd her to restrain Her boundless grief, in rev'rence of the fane: She answer'd, starting from the sable bier, ‘Can I forget that Arabert was dear? ‘Can I, cold monitor! at once uproot ‘Th' affections from my inmost soul that shoot? ‘Can I forget, as destitute I lay, ‘To sickness, grief, and penury a prey, ‘How eagerly he flew at Pity's call, ‘Put forth his hand, and rais'd me from my fall? ‘All unsolicited he gave me wealth, ‘He gave me solace, and he gave me health: ‘And, dearer than the bliss those gifts impart, ‘He strain'd me to his breast, and gave his heart: ‘And shall these hallow'd walls and awful fane ‘Reproach the voice that pours the praiseful strain? ‘Say, at the friend's, the guardian's, lover's tomb, ‘Can Sorrow sleep, and Gratitude be dumb? ‘But I submit—and bend thus meekly low, ‘To kiss th' avenging hand that dealt the blow: ‘Resign'd I quit the losing path I trod, ‘Fall'n is my idol—and I worship God.’ She ceas'd—the choir intones the fun'ral song, Which holy echoes plaintively prolong; And now the solemn organ, tun'd to woe, Pour'd the clear notes pathetically slow: These rites perform'd—along th' extending fane She now attends the slow-proceeding train; Who o'er the mournful cypress-shaded way, To the expecting tomb the dead convey. See now the priests the closing act prepare, And to the darksome vault commit their care: At this dread scene, too feelingly distress'd, She pour'd the last effusions of her breast: ‘Come, guardian Seraph, from thy throne above, ‘And watch the tomb of my departed love!’ She paus'd—then (o'er the yawning tomb reclin'd) In all the tenderness of grief rejoin'd: ‘Oh Beauty's flow'r—Oh Pleasure ever new— ‘Oh Friendship, Love, and Constancy, adieu! ‘Ye virtues that adorn'd th' unhappy Youth, ‘Affection, Pity, Confidence, and Truth, ‘The gen'rous thoughts that with the feeling dwell, ‘And sympathy of heart—farewell, farewell! ‘Not all of Arabert this tomb contains, ‘All is not here while Leonore remains: ‘Methinks a voice e'en animates the clay, ‘And in low accents summons me away: ‘Haste, Leonore—thy other self rejoin, ‘And let thy glowing ashes mix with mine. ‘Ah, trust me, Arabert! to share thy doom, ‘Prepar'd, resolv'd, I'll meet thee in the tomb: ‘Forbear, Oh Heav'n, in pity to these tears, ‘To curse my sorrow with a length of years! ‘When this grief-drooping form shall press the bier, ‘Say, virtuous Anselm, wilt thou not be near, ‘To grace the close of my unhappy doom, ‘And lay these limbs in this lamented tomb? ‘Thus when this tortur'd heart shall cease to rave, ‘Our blended dust shall warm the faithful grave: ‘Nor distant far is that releasing hour, ‘For Nature now, oppress'd beyond her pow'r, ‘Resigns at length my troubled soul to rest, ‘And Grief's last anguish rushes thro' my breast.’ Behold her now extended on the ground, And see the sacred brethren kneeling round: Them she addresses in a fault'ring tone, ‘Say, cannot Death my daring crime atone? ‘Ah, let Compassion now your hearts inspire, ‘Amid your pray'rs I unalarm'd expire. ‘Thou who art e'en in this dread moment dear, ‘Oh, shade of Arabert, still hover near: ‘I come.’—And now, emerging from her woes, ('Twas Love's last effort) from the earth she rose; And, strange to tell! with strong affection fraught, She headlong plung'd into the gloomy vault: And there, what her impassion'd wish requir'd, On the lov'd breast of Arabert expir'd. WRITTEN IN Mr. HUME's History. Big with the tales of other years, I view th' historic tome; Which to the pensive mind appears A deep capacious tomb: Where long embalm'd by Clio's hand, The patriot and the slave, Who sav'd, and who betray'd the land, Press one extensive grave: With those that grasp'd th' imperial helm, And trod the path of Pow'r: With those who grac'd fair Learning's realm, And Beauty's fairer bow'r. If thus th' illustrious close their scene, Oblivion then may laugh: What flows from Hume's recording pen Is but an Epitaph! IMITATED From the FRENCH. Straying beside yon wood-screen'd river, Dan Cupid met my wond'ring view; His feather'd arrows stor'd his quiver, Each feather glow'd a different hue: ‘For him who frames the daring deed, ‘(The little Godhead said, and laugh'd) ‘To fly with Miss beyond the Tweed, ‘An eagle's plume adorns the shaft. ‘The prattler, vain of his address, ‘The magpye's feathers never fail; ‘And for the youth too fond of dress, ‘I rob the gaudy peacock's tail. ‘Whene'er I mean to rouse the care ‘That lurks within the jealous heart, ‘The owl that wings the midnight air ‘Lends his grave plume to load the dart. ‘But rarely when I would assail ‘The constant heart with truth imprest, ‘Then for the trembling shaft I steal ‘A feather from the turtle's breast: ‘Lo! one with that soft plumage crown'd, ‘Which more than all my arms I prize!’ ‘—Alas!’ I cried, ‘this gave the wound, ‘When late you shot from Julia's eyes.’ FOR THE VASE AT BATH EASTON This poetical institution ceased at the death of Lady Millar, 1781; which event has been celebrated by Miss Seward. UPON DREAMS. NOVEMBER, 1777. I. As Echo's voice returns the pleasing lay, So is a Dream the echo of the day: The busy thoughts that round some object teem Oft join in sleep to form the nightly theme; Then bright-ey'd Fancy lifts her magic wand, While scenes unreal rise at her command; Then Comedy, with all her laughing train, Straight issues from the porch of Comus' fane, And bringing with her all her pleasing wiles, Her pranks, her gambols, and her winning smiles, She bids her merry troop approach the bed, And beat their airy dance round Anstey's head. II. Still when some chosen Fair commands the heart, Gay Fancy acts at night her mimic part: With skilful hand she decks the living scene, And ushers to the view the bosom's Queen. Ye Lovers, answer to the truth I sing; Say, does not Fancy to your slumber bring, Dress'd by each grace, in Beauty's best array, The welcome Fair who charm'd you thro' the day? Does not her form return to glad the sight, Like Cynthia bursting thro' the cloud of night? How pleas'd each well-known feature we descry, That look of sense—that eloquence of eye!— She speaks—her words, beyond vain Music's art, Steal on our slumber, and enchant the heart. III. Sometimes a dream anticipates the date, Comes as a prophet to reveal our fate: And thus, ere Yorick sunk into the tomb, The Priest of sentiment foresaw his doom: 'Twas night—his solitary couch he press'd, Till sorrow-worn he wearied into rest; Eliza then soft gliding on his view, Thus o'er his slumber breath'd her sad adieu: ‘Oh thou, my guardian, confident, and friend, ‘To what thy handmaid now reveals attend: ‘No longer now the gift of Health implore, ‘The curtain drops, and thy short scene is o'er; ‘Yet ere thy feeling spirit takes its flight ‘To yonder regions of celestial light, ‘Some fond endearment to Eliza shew, ‘And thy last blessing on thy Child bestow.’ The Vision ceas'd—yet then the shaul she spread See the Letters to Eliza., To raise compassionate his drooping head, And (from her eyes as beads of sorrow fell) Low on her knees receiv'd his last farewell. FOR THE VASE AT BATH EASTON. DISSIPATION. I. If Hope, the friend of Man, extend a ray Along the sky of some far distant day; Gay Dissipation boasts a friendlier pow'r, She breaks the gloom that dims the present hour! E'en painter-like she takes her ready stand, A radiant pencil decks her skilful hand, And with the colours of her magic art She gilds the cloud that settles on the heart. II. This Proteus often takes a different frame: To Heroes she assumes the shape of Fame; To suckling Bards she rolls the river Cam; To Dowagers she takes the form of Pam. III. Could Celia long endure a country life; The prim false-breeding of th' attorney's wife; The parson's pun; the husband's duller joke; The solitary walk; the raven's croak; Did not the Goddess act the Prophet's part, And to her mournful votary impart The wish'd-for blessings that are doom'd to crown The chearful hours that glide within the town, And paint young Pleasure's gayly-vested train With all the conquests of the next campaign? And e'en in town could she endure the weight Of the long after-dinner tête-à-tête, Did not the Goddess to her mind recal Th' approaching splendors of the evening ball? IV. Behold, encircled with Affliction's gloom, Belinda watches at her husband's tomb; Beneath th' oppressive weight of grief she bends, Like the pale lily when the rain descends: But Dissipation, with her soothing aid, Forbids the beauteous drooping flow'r to fade. The Fair intends, in proof of her distress, To wear the mourning of the days of Bess! But in obedience to the present court, Kind Dissipation bids her wear the short. At her command, while tears bedew her cheeks, Belinda through the veil of mourning peeps; Her pulse beats quicker as she then surveys Th' approaching prospect of more happy days: At length the change of mourning brings relief, And at the change she loses half her grief. Now on the joys that meet her on the way, The mourner casts a fearful coy survey: Now less reserv'd, a bolder view she sends, And bolder still the Pleasure's bark ascends, Where laughing Hebe grasps the glitt'ring helm, To guide the vessel to th' Idalian realm. Now soft recorders send a soothing sound, And in the notes affliction's plaints are drown'd; The sails grow pregnant with the wanton air, Not unregarded by the conscious Fair, Who glides obedient to the fav'ring wind, And leaves the gloom of widowhood behind. THE INDIAN CHIEF. An English Officer in the late war being taken prisoner by the French Indians, became the slave of an old Indian Chief, who treated him with humanity. One day the Indian took the Officer up a hill, and addressed him as follows: See the Anecdotes of Literature, vol. 5th. ‘Twelve tedious moons hast thou my captive been, ‘I've taught thee how to build the swift canoe, ‘To chase the boar, prepare the beaver's skin, ‘To speed the shaft, and scalp the shrieking foe. ‘Say, does thy Father sleep within his grave?’— ‘Oh Heav'n forbid!’ the feeling Youth replied— ‘Then do his sorrows all my pity crave,’ The Chief return'd—‘'Twere better he had died. ‘I was a Father once—oh valiant son! ‘Thy loss each low'ring morn and eve recal. ‘To shield my years, to Danger's path he run; ‘These eyes beheld the gallant warrior fall: ‘And Glory saw him fall with wounds o'erspread, ‘Bold on his bosom ev'ry wound he bore: ‘I rent the forelock from his murd'rer's head, ‘And left him breathless on the crimson shore. ‘Since that sad day my hours no pleasure share’— The Indian Chief now paus'd, with sorrow fraught, Wrapt in the awful silence of despair; At length in words he cloath'd his mournful thought. ‘Behold that sun! how bright it shines to you! ‘Since that sad day to me it looks a cloud: ‘How gay yon blooming roses meet your view! ‘To me Grief drops o'er Nature's breast a shroud. ‘Go, virtuous Stranger! to thy Father go, ‘Wipe from his furrow'd cheek Misfortune's tear: ‘Go, bid the sun to him his splendor shew, ‘And bid the flow'r in all her bloom appear.’ INSCRIPTION FOR A REED-HOUSE Say, if to shun the noisy day, The summer sun's oppressive ray, Thou visit'st Contemplation's cell, Here tarry—she'll repay thee well: For she can bid each passion cease, And sooth the troubled heart to peace, Can to thy sober wishes yield Contentment's flow'r and Wisdom's shield. At Cossy, the Seat of Sir William Jerningham. THE VENETIAN MARRIAGE. The western sun's expiring ray To Venice gave a milder day; Till by degrees the ling'ring light Serenely soften'd into night. Camilla then, with fearful soul, To th' Adriatic margin stole, Where in a bark, at Love's command, Placentio took his faithful stand: Possessing now his future bride, He bade the bark securely glide, Which far unlike that gally show'd That down the silver Cydnus row'd, Beneath whose purple sails were seen Proud Ostentation's gaudy Queen, Who sure of conquest, vain of mind, All languishingly lay reclin'd! Here Beauty undefil'd by art, Whose bosom own'd a tender heart, Beneath the sails from home remov'd, And trusted to the man she lov'd. A soothing calmness lull'd the deep, And hush'd each wavy surge to sleep: The air along the sultry day, Scorch'd by the summer's fervent ray, Was freshen'd by a recent show'r, While silence solemniz'd the hour. The still solemnity impress'd With awful thoughts Camilla's breast: For now by prompting Love impell'd, Now by Timidity withheld, The words she to her lips applied Recoil'd, and unaccented died. Placentio too, alike subdued, They sail'd along in silent mood, And stillness reign'd from shore to shore, Unbroke—but by the dashing oar. At length the Fair dissolv'd the charm— ‘Ah, wonder not I feel alarm: ‘Confiding in thy love I came, ‘And risk'd for thee my virgin fame: ‘Ah tell me to what place we sail, ‘For in my bosom fears prevail:— ‘Yet answer not this idle fear, ‘Where'er thou art, bright Honour's there.’ ‘The plan I form,’ the Youth replied, ‘To Innocence is close allied, ‘And fearful of thy virgin fame ‘As of her babe the tender dame. ‘—These waves, that wander to the sea, ‘Wash in their pilgrimage a tree, ‘Which spreads its lowly branches wide, ‘And dips them in the passing tide: ‘There, in a shed compos'd of reeds, ‘An aged hermit tells his beads: ‘He, gen'rous Sage! will join our hands ‘In wedlock's unremitting bands. ‘Then to Valclusa we'll repair, ‘Where Laura's soul informs the air: ‘Where Petrarch's spirit hovers round, ‘The guardian of the sacred ground, ‘Forbidding still the fiend of art, ‘That shrewd perverter of the heart, ‘The snake, Inconstancy, to rove ‘Within the paradise of Love. ‘As when the winter's storms are fled ‘The fearful snow-drop lifts her head, ‘So may that whiter flow'r, thy breast, ‘Wake into life, from fears releas'd, ‘Mild as these twilight breezes blow, ‘Still as the waves on which we flow!’ ‘Ye walls where first I drew the air!’ Return'd (assur'd) the beauteous Fair; ‘Ye turrets which but dimly seen ‘Encrease the terrour of the scene! ‘Ye stately tow'rs! and rising spires! ‘From you Camilla now retires. ‘Thou tomb whose pious urn contains ‘My sacred Parents' cold remains! ‘Ye partners of my tender years, ‘Whom youthful sympathy endears! ‘Ye joys that crown my native coast!— ‘Well for Placentio all are lost.’ She ceas'd—and on her pensive soul Again an awful musing stole, Such as the twilight scene excites, Such as the feeling heart delights; For as the coy nocturnal flow'r The night-smelling Geranium. No more its sweets at eve withholds, So the meek heart at th' evening hour Its sensibility unfolds. The mild enlivener of the night Now yields her kind directing light! As from the wood's deep bosom sprung, Her sober radiance round she flung, The trees that slept along the shore With light's soft veil she mantled o'er; The bending tow'r of old renown She rounded with a silver crown: The antique fane now rose to view, Envelop'd in the purest hue: Behold the lustre spreading wide Illuminates the ocean-tide, While placid beams serenely gay Like star-drops on her bosom play! This beauteous soul-subduing sight, Diffusing round a calm delight, With sympathetic touch imprest The seat of Love, Placentio's breast: ‘Behold,’ he cried, with Pleasure's voice, ‘Thou Beauty's flow'r, Affection's choice! ‘Behold how Nature decks the night, ‘And cloaths her scenes with vestal light! ‘Methinks kind Heav'n displays its pow'r ‘To decorate thy nuptial hour.’ At length they reach the sacred cell Where Wisdom, Peace, and Virtue dwell; There, bent beneath the weight of age, They find prepar'd th' expecting Sage. He hail'd them in a friendly tone, And bade them call his cell their own: Where rose an altar form'd of moss, Crown'd with a simple wooden cross! There too a taper, mildly bright, Supplied a pompous glare of light. No holy relick rich-enchas'd This humble low-roof'd temple grac'd: But flowrets from the neighb'ring wood The unambitious altar strew'd: For incense they exhal'd perfume, For ornament they gave their bloom. The Hermit spoke—‘Hail, virtuous pair, ‘May sorrow now your bosom spare! ‘Tho' youth be yours, yet well I know ‘You've tasted deep of human woe: ‘Control, and Art, and Baseness join'd ‘To cancel what your hearts design'd: ‘But now Misfortune's reign is o'er, ‘And Pleasure opens all her store.’ See now the youthful Pair unite To meet the hymeneal rite: Pronouncing, as they lowly bow, Warm from the heart, the hallow'd vow: At length the Hermit joins their hands In willing and unvenal bands, Unspotted bands! which mutual Love, And Confidence, and Virtue wove. THE MEXICAN FRIENDS. ADVERTISEMENT. The sublime instance of heroic friendship that forms the subject of this Poem, is recorded by ANTONIO DE SOLIS, is his History of Mexico. This is an episode of a more extensive poem, which is suppressed: This episode is retained, as being the part of that poem which was favourably received. Two fragments, which met with the same distinction, are also preserved. Two valiant Youths (whom Friendship's holy hand Had join'd with her indissoluble band) Beheld indignant, smit with patriot grief, The great achievements of the hostile chief: And now Janellan thus accosts his Friend:— ‘Firm to no purpose, active to no end, ‘See from our gallant men yon hallow'd tow'r ‘Already ravish'd by the invading pow'r: ‘Must this, committed to our mutual care, ‘The same defeat, the same dishonour share? ‘If so—the victor shall not long survive— ‘A thought that bids my fading hope revive, ‘A thought—that like the thunder-flash of night ‘Darts on my darken'd mind a radiant light— ‘But ere my veil'd designment I unfold, ‘Declare, however rash, however bold, ‘Thou'lt not o'ershade with Caution's chill controul, ‘The warm, the splendid purpose of my soul.’ Venzula to his breast his hand applied, And thus, beyond the pow'r of words, replied. The Youth resum'd—‘From this aerial height, ‘Bid thy bold vision take its deepest flight, ‘Down to yon rock, far stretching o'er the shore, ‘'Gainst which the raging waves incessant roar, ‘Whose clashing voices into stillness fade, ‘Ere this tremendous distance they pervade: ‘If Fortune bless what my proud counsels urge, ‘Yon waves shall murmur soon the victor's dirge! ‘My secret project I will now unveil:— ‘Should Cortez o'er this valiant band prevail, ‘Should thro' controulment, and thro' stubborn force, ‘Pour like a torrent his destructive course, ‘When on this summit first he shall appear, ‘I will advance, with well-dissembled fear, ‘And, suppliant as I kneel to win his grace, ‘I'll dauntless lock him in a stern embrace, ‘Bear him reluctant to yon giddy steep, ‘Where yawns a dreadful opening to the deep, ‘And thence—self-ruin'd for my country's good— ‘Plunge with her foe into the whelming flood!’ Venzula answer'd—‘Yes, I much admire ‘What now thy matchless virtue dares inspire: ‘But wilt thou, with an avarice of fame, ‘The meed of Glory all exclusive claim? ‘Wilt thou to perils close to Death adjoin'd ‘Advance, and leave thy faithful Friend behind? ‘In infancy we shar'd the glitt'ring toys, ‘And in one circle play'd our harmless joys: ‘And when we quitted Childhood's lowly vale, ‘Where springing flowrets scent the playful gale, ‘Still hand in hand we climb'd youth's arduous height, ‘Whence greater scenes expanded on the sight, ‘Still our pursuits consenting to one plan, ‘Like wedded streams our lives united ran: ‘And wilt thou now oppose the sacred tide, ‘And bid the friendly waves disparting glide?’ Janellan spoke—‘Endearing Youth! forgive: ‘The conqu'ror of some future Cortez live! ‘Nor mark my fall with Grief's dejected brow, ‘View from my death the bright effects that flow: ‘Behold the tomb that Gratitude shall raise, ‘Illustrious signal of my Country's praise.’ To this the brave Venzula made reply, And as he spoke, tears started from his eye: ‘What tho' Felicity, thy gift, shall stream ‘Sunlike o'er Mexico with brightest beam, ‘Not all the splendour that her rays impart, ‘Will e'er illumine my benighted heart, ‘When destitute of thee, its only ray, ‘Without the hope of kind returning day. ‘Yet then to this great argument adjoin'd ‘Sublimer motives urge my steady mind: ‘Recal, recal that joy-diffusing hour, ‘When gay Prosperity adorn'd my bow'r, ‘As thy fair sister, half-afraid to speak, ‘With downcast look, and blush-embellish'd cheek, ‘At Love's request assented to be mine: ‘Of fleeting bliss vain momentary shine! ‘For she, in flow'r of Youth and Virtue's bloom, ‘Was swept untimely to the rav'nous tomb: ‘As sorrow-wounded o'er her couch I hung, ‘To catch the tones that faded as they sprung, ‘The God, she said, now summons me away, ‘Far from the confines of th' endearing day: ‘Thou of the life I lose the dearest part, ‘Thou chosen spouse! thou sun-beam of my heart, ‘Say, by Affection's glowing hand impress'd, ‘Shall I not live in thy recording breast? ‘If sacred be the suff'rer's last desires, ‘Revere what now my parting soul requires: ‘I leave a brother, by bright Honour rear'd, ‘By all approv'd, and much to me endear'd: ‘Be, for the sister's love, the brother's Friend; ‘Nor from his side depart when storms descend: ‘The palm of Glory waving in your sight, ‘In council, peril, enterprise unite.’ ‘Shall I, when danger calls, consign to air ‘The last bequeathing wishes of the Fair? ‘Perdition catch the base unmanly thought! ‘By Love's subliming purest dictates taught, ‘Amid the perils that around thee wait, ‘View me resolv'd to share th' impending fate: Now to this spot the foe impels the war, ‘Discordance screams, opposing lances jar: ‘The steep ascent, lo! Cortez now has gain'd, ‘Ah! mark his spear with streaming gore distain'd! The illustrious Youths now act their dread design: See at the victor's knee they low incline! Now clasp with circling force th' incautious foe, And close adhering to his figure grow: Their deadly aim his better fate control'd, With matchless pow'r he bursts their stubborn hold: The heroes, blasted in their bold intent, Approach'd (Death hov'ring near) the dire descent: Then, in each other's circling arms intwin'd, In energetic harmony combin'd: 'Twas Friendship, burning with meridian flame, One cause—one thought—one ruin—and one fame: Tremendous moment! See, they fall from light, And dauntless rush to never-ending night! Ye self-devoted patriot victims, hail! Oblivion's gulph shall ne'er entomb your tale: While History to Time's extremest goal Her stream majestic shall thro' ages roll, Like two fair flowrets on one stem that blow, Ye on her margin shall for ever glow. GUATIMOZINO's SPEECH, AT THE PLACE OF INTERMENT. The Mexicans having gained an advantage over the Spaniards, and having buried the troops (that were slain in the action) in a large field, Guatimozino, the emperor of Mexico, thus addresses the place of interment: “Hail, sepulchre, which ev'ry coward shuns! “Thou glorious hecatomb of Valour's sons! “On thee, oh sacred altar of renown, “Th' Eternal Being looks propitious down! “They, they are dear to that all-seeing eye, “Who greatly daring act, or bravely die. “Let this suggestion sooth the bleeding heart, “In which Despair has lodg'd his poison'd dart: “To you I speak, ye fair afflicted train, “Who weep for brothers, friends, and lovers slain: “To you I speak, ye widows plung'd in care; “And you whose sons stern fate refus'd to spare.” As thus he said—deep from some breast unknown Burst unsubdued Affliction's piercing moan, Now intermitting, now returning loud— At length, advancing thro' the wond'ring crowd, A matron-form th' attentive hero view'd, Her robe neglected, and her tresses rude; With hurried step the royal Youth she sought, Her wild eye speaking th' inexpressive thought: Close at her side a lovely boy appears— Now through opposing grief her voice she rears: “Give, give to me the virtue that repels “The whelming surge of Sorrow as it swells! “Two valiant sons, in age my comfort's store, “My lov'd, my duteous children, are no more: “This morn, this direful morn, a prey to fears, “I bath'd our parting with presaging tears: “That they expir'd on Honour's sacred bed, “That their souls mingle with th' illustrious dead, “Well do I know—and glory in the thought: “Bright Virtue's flame, perchance, from me they caught, “From me th' instructive lesson first they claim'd, “This bosom nurtur'd, and this voice inflam'd. “Yet ill with this vain pomp of splendid words “My drooping, loaded, sinking heart accords: “Ah! still to Glory's thought despair succeeds, “And th' agonizing Mother inly bleeds. “This orphan babe to you I now bequeath, “With Honour's brightest flow'rs his mind inwreath.” The child, half-conscious of the mother's grief, As if attempting to dispense relief, Stretch'd forth his little arms, and playful smil'd: In vain the boy her scorpion thoughts beguil'd; Inclining at his call her anguish'd face, Death struck she perish'd in the wish'd embrace. THE SPEECH OF THE HIGH-PRIEST, AT THE PILE. Guatimozino having opposed the Spaniards with great bravery in various engagements, was at length defeated and taken prisoner. In order to extort from him a discovery of the principal mines, he was laid on burning coals: The second in command was also condemned to the same torture, and amidst his sufferings called upon his royal master, to be released from the vow of secrecy; which drew from Guatimozino these memorable words: Am I on a bed of roses?—When the flames had entirely consumed the unfortunate Hero, the High-Priest of Mexico approached the pile, and lamented the fate of his royal Master. When first th' inhuman deed appall'd his sight, E'en as the cedar shrunk in sudden blight He stood—while, at the dire appearance thrill'd, Each function of the soul numb Horror chill'd: At length, relenting into conscious grief, The Seer exclaim'd—“Oh lov'd, oh hapless Chief! “The ashes still that feed yon ling'ring flame, “Do they of all thou art th' existence claim? “Long school'd in pale Adversity's rude porch, “Where Hope's gay scenes are burnt by Havock's torch, “For me, with grief adjoin'd to age oppress'd, “Remain'd but this to cleave my care-worn breast. “In early youth to me thou wast consign'd, “I watch'd the dawn of thy celestial mind, “I saw, by Nature wak'd, thy talents rise, “And Virtue mark them with her brightest dies. “Ah! what avail these fruitless tears I shed? “Tho' thou art gone—yet Vengeance is not dead: “The pregnant womb of Time”—He added not— While from his eye a radiant meaning shot. His bosom heav'd with a prophetic throe, Till language gave his struggling thoughts to flow. “Methinks Futurity, celestial Maid, “Thro' distant Time's dim length'ning isle display'd, “Pours on my favour'd vision days unborn, “That pant impatient for the ling'ring morn: “Smooth as the clear expanse of vernal skies, “A world of water claims my wond'ring eyes; “See on its wavy breast, in splendid pride, “Innum'rous brigantines triumphant ride The Spanish Armada sailed in 1588, disposed in the form of a crescent, and stretching the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one division to that of the other. Hume: “Mark how the gorgeous mass advancing ploughs “The groaning main with high aspiring prows: “Secure in all the haughtiness of strength, “It moves a crescent of tremendous length, “And big with thunders and destructive force, “To Britain's coast directs its threat'ning course. “Oft has Las Casas, in applauding strain, “To me reveal'd that sea-encircled plain. “Thou Glory of the West! Enchantment's isle, “Where beauteous maids on godlike heroes smile: “By Nature's hand with Nature's chaplet crown'd, “In arts, in commerce, and in arms renown'd; “August, magnificent, exalted Dame, “As with a garment rob'd in Freedom's flame! “Arise, arise—forestall th' intended blow, “See to thy portal sails th' audacious foe. “Another scenery is now display'd, “No more the main assembled vessels shade, “A beggar'd remnant (of the splendid throng “That swept in conscious majesty along) “With prows disfigur'd, and dishonour'd masts, “While thro' the rent sails mourn the hollow blasts, “In shatter'd, mean, dismantled, rude array, “Steal o'er the waves their ignominious way. “Oh! of thy brilliant and extensive train “Do these, Armada, these alone remain? “Who has o'erthrown the honours of thy helm? “The voice of Fame replies—Eliza's realm!— “Where lurk thy galleons that surpris'd the deep? “Loud Fame replies—In Ocean's tomb they sleep! “And of Hispania once the bright renown, “Now glows an added gem to Britain's crown.” The curiosity of an ignorant Mexican, concerning the origin of the Air, is so poetically expressed in the following lines, that the Editor thinks himself justified in re-printing them, though they were omitted by the Author in the last edition of his Poems. “Whence is that veering spirit of the sky, “Whose secret form eludes the human eye; “Who now, unmindful of its matchless pow'r “Indulgent whispers to the vernal flow'r, “Plays with her leaves, and hov'ring o'er her bloom “From her young breast allures the enclos'd perfume: “And now, envelop'd in a sullen mood, “Tempestuous rushes on the groaning wood; “Arm'd with destructive energy, invades, “Despoils, devasts the consecrated shades?” THE ANCIENT ENGLISH WAKE; A POEM. ADVERTISEMENT. The Wake is of very great antiquity in this country. It was held on the day of the Dedication, that is, on the day of the saint to whom the village church was dedicated. Booths were erected in the church-yard and on the adjacent plain, and after divine service the rest of the time was devoted to the occupations of the fair, to merriment and festivity. See BOURNE'S Antiquities of the Common People, with Observations by Mr. BRAND. The merchants, who frequented the fairs in numerous caravans or companies, employed every art to draw the people together. They were therefore accompanied by jugglers, minstrels, and buffoons. WARTON'S History of English Poetry, vol. ii. p. 367. Hark! how the merry, merry bells resound, To summon to the Wake the hamlets round: The villagers, in all their best array, Go forth to celebrate the festive day. Now from the moat-encircled castle came An aged Chief, who grac'd the roll of Fame: Who knows not A celebrated character in the reign of Henry the Third. Chester's Earl, to worth ally'd, The boast of chivalry, and valour's pride? From courts and busy camps at length retir'd, To deeds of Fame no longer he aspir'd: Pleas'd, far sequester'd from the voice of praise, To give to peace his last remaining days, And while life's hour-glass near its period stands, To watch and pray beside the closing sands. But, 'mid the stillness of retirement's shade, Domestic sorrow on his bosom prey'd: A Daughter, fram'd his favor to engage, Pride of his house, and soother of his age, Her native mansion had abruptly fled— The veil of darkness o'er the rest was spread. Oft of his child some welcome news to gain The tortur'd Father sought, but sought in vain. He strives (this day) his sorrows to beguile, And hide his anguish with a sickly smile. The hoary Pastor, near the village-fane, Receiv'd the honour'd Chief and all his train: This holy, meek, disinterested man Had form'd his useful life on duty's plan: Unpractis'd in those arts that teach to rise, The vacant mitre ne'er allur'd his eyes. Regardless still of dissipation's call, He seldom tarried at the festive hall, Where all around the storied texture hung, Where psaltries sounded, and where minstrels sung; But to the humble cot's neglected door The sacred man the balm of comfort bore: Still would he listen to the injur'd swain, For he who listens mitigates the pain: There was he seen reclining o'er the bed, Where the pale maiden bow'd her anguish'd head; Where, rest of hope, the yielding victim lay, And like a wreath of snow dissolv'd away: With feeling soul the Pastor oft enquir'd Where the meek train of silent grief retir'd, Shame, that declines her sorrows to impart, The drooping spirit, and the broken heart. He ne'er the friar's gaping wallet fed, But to the widow sent his loaf of bread: His fee to Rome reluctantly he paid, And call'd the Pardoner's a pilf'ring trade. The sacred Psalter well he knew to gloss, And on its page illuminate the cross: The written Missal on the altar seen, Inclos'd in velvet of the richest green, Display'd initials by his fancy plann'd, Whose brilliant colours own'd his skilful hand. This gaily-letter'd book his art devis'd, The temple's only ornament compriz'd: The hallow'd service of this modest fane (Far from the splendor of a choral train) Could boast no labour'd chant, no solemn rites, No clouds of incense, and no pomp of lights; But at the plain and lowly altar stands The village-priest with pure uplifted hands, Invoking from above Heav'n's guardian care, In all the meek simplicity of pray'r. Fam'd Chester, now returning from the fane, Surveys the tents gay-spreading o'er the plain: Beneath whose roof the merchant-band display'd The cheerful scenery of active trade: While some, intent on wealth, with sober view, The graver purport of the fair pursue; Some, of a free and roving mind, partake The various callings of the busy Wake; These urge the prescient seer, deep-vers'd in sate, Some passage of their story to relate: There the fond maid, solicitous to know Some future instance of her joy or woe, Attends, half unbelieving, half sincere, To the vague dictates of the artful Seer. Lo, where the trader all his art employs To rear the pageantry of holy toys, And on the simple rustics shed the glare Of gaudy Superstition's lighter ware: Here beads hung round in many a splendid row, In crystal glitter, or in coral glow: Here gayly-painted saints attract the sight, There ivory crosses of the purest white: Here brilliant pebbles from the hallow'd well, In which are lodg'd the wonder-working spell. Some by the travell'd pilgrim take their stand, To hear the wonders of a foreign strand; While others, smitten with the love of song, Around the minstrel's harp attentive throng. Of war and daring chiefs the master sung, While from the chords terrific sounds he flung: At length, descending from his lofty mood, The feeling bard a milder theme pursued, And gently wak'd those soft, complaining tones, So dear to melody, which Scotland owns Though the Scottish music, as we now have it, is attributed to James the First of Scotland, yet, as most of the harpers were supposed to have come from the North, it is very probable that there was something alluring and characteristic in the northern music previous to that period, and which partook of the style that reigns in the compositions of James the First, and which Tasconi calls Musica lamentevole e mesta differente da tutte l'altre.. Now, when the thronging audience all withdrew, A beauteous Maiden still remain'd in view: She seem'd as one of the dejected kind, Whose face betrays the secret of the mind; She look'd as opening day scarce ting'd with light, Or summer's eve when fading into night: She spoke—‘Sweet are the songs from Scotland's coast, ‘They, they admire them best who feel them most: ‘Abrupt pathetic airs, devoid of art, ‘That breathe upon the soul and melt the heart: ‘Still, when the bard some mournful tale records, ‘With plaintive harmony they clothe his words; ‘Ah! then they witness to the ear of grief, ‘That food to sorrow is the best relief. ‘Bend, gen'rous minstrel, to a mourner's pray'r, ‘Sooth with thy art the ills I'm doom'd to bear; ‘Still let some Highland airs thy skill employ, ‘And steep my soul in melancholy joy.’ Attentive to the tuneful Maid's request, With magic touch the weeping harp he press'd, And waken'd into life that pow'rful strain, Whose sound persuasive charms almost to pain, That thrilling harmony to nature true, Whose arrows only wound the sacred few. See now the throng in clust'ring numbers go To where the troop display'd the gaudy show Dr. Warton observes, in his History of English Poetry, that the subject of this sort of spectacle was (till the reign of Henry the Seventh) confined to moral allegory, or to religion blended with buffoonery.: They first presented to th' expecting view, Amid encircling clouds of richest hue, Religion, on a throne exalted high, While flow'rs fell sprinkling from the mimic sky: Now stately ent'ring on the splendid scene, Array'd in white, three female forms were seen: These female figures to th' admiring crowd The names of Faith, of Hope, of Love avow'd: Three rivals; they appear before the throne To plead—and make their various merit known. Faith, while a sable band o'erspread her eyes, In accents to this purport claim'd the prize: ‘Foe to the prying search of shallow wit, ‘Thy sacred lore, unquestion'd, I admit: ‘Before the dazzling splendor of the Law ‘I close my view, and bend with trembling awe.’ Hope, with an air to confidence ally'd, Advanc'd—her symbol leaning at her side: ‘The sea of life do wrecking winds deform? ‘Borne on a plank, I smile amidst the storm: ‘Still thro' the dark'ning show'rs that intervene, ‘With piercing view I mark the promis'd scene, ‘Where, list'ning to the ocean's distant roar, ‘Delight sits harbour'd near the fragrant shore.’ Next Charity, with looks that dwelt on high, Her soul, ecstatic, beaming from her eye, Began—‘No fond expectancies I frame, ‘I boast no merit, no reward I claim; ‘While Heav'n's creative pow'r around me flows, ‘The flame of love within my bosom glows; ‘Rais'd from the nature of a senseless clod, ‘I burn with gratitude, and thank my God! ‘I feel, I feel affection's piercing dart—’ She paus'd, and laid her hand upon her heart. A dove-like form now sailing from the skies, Bore in her beak the flow'r-inwoven prize; Religion reach'd it from the hov'ring dove, And twin'd the wreath around the brow of Love. Now other actors mute attention claim, Whose antic gestures mark'd a lighter aim; A troop of busy mutt'ring friars press'd Around a law-man by the fiend possest: The meagre Exorcist now plies his part, Acts all the wonders of his secret art: Nor word of magic, pray'r, nor rite avails, The whole artillery of the Father fails: At length he sportive cries: ‘Still uncontroul'd, ‘No pow'r can wrest sly Satan from his hold; ‘Here end we then this ineffectual strife, ‘A lawyer's bosom is a place for life.’— The baffled Exorcist now quits his ground, While peals of simple laughter burst around. See to the tents the villagers repair, The solace of the temp'rate feast to share; A gay pavilion, that adorn'd the plain, Receiv'd time-honour'd Chester and his train: 'Twas then a Maid, whose cheek wore beauty's hue, (Clad as a pilgrim) rush'd upon their view; And said, while at the Warrior's feet she fell, ‘This lowly attitude becomes me well; ‘Nor will I ever raise my blushing face, ‘Till my lov'd Father shall pronounce my grace.’ ‘Lost Agatha!’ th' astonished Chester cries; ‘Lost Agatha!’ each glad'ning guest replies. ‘Tell, tell me, fugitive,’ the Father said, ‘Before my blessing on thy soul I shed, ‘Dost thou return with all thy bloom of name, ‘And all the wonted fragrance of thy fame? ‘If, soil'd by vice in some unhappy hour, ‘Thy character has lost its boasted flow'r, ‘Away, away—far from my sight retire, ‘Nor dare, rash girl! to meet thy wrathful Sire.’ With injur'd look, and blush-embellish'd cheek, The beauteous Agatha began to speak: ‘Proud of my ancestry, our honor'd name ‘Shall ne'er thro' me receive the blast of shame; ‘Pure as the lily drooping with the dew ‘(Heav'n is my judge) I now approach thy view.’ ‘Then with a Father's wonted glow I burn, ‘My fond affections all to thee return; ‘Thy look, thy words, thy tears, each doubt efface,’ He said—and lock'd her in his close embrace. At length he urg'd his daughter to recite The dark mysterious purport of her flight. In act to speak advanc'd the beauteous Fair, And drew attention still as midnight air: She sigh'd—the roses on her cheek grew pale, While expectation panted for the tale. ‘Recall,’ she said, ‘that brilliant hour recall, ‘When first Rodolphus grac'd the festive hall; ‘Adorn'd with Valor's wreath, in early fame, ‘In flow'r of youth, in beauty's pride he came; ‘The blush of diffidence was on his brow, ‘When, in soft voice, he spoke the ardent vow: ‘Oh kind, oh generous Sire! thy friendly voice ‘Approv'd the Youth, and sanctified my choice: ‘To his affection as I nearer drew, ‘Encreasing merit open'd on my view: ‘When he discours'd (till then to me unknown) ‘I breath'd the sigh that sorrow does not own: ‘Regardless of the throng when he was by, ‘Still linger'd on his form my love-sick eye, ‘Still did each moment some new charm disclose, ‘As brings each gale new fragrance from the rose. ‘Oh tender Sire! thou nam'dst the nuptial hour, ‘And grac'd thy daughter with a regal dow'r: ‘Ah me! what boots it that I now display ‘The fatal cloud that brooded o'er that day? ‘That day—when hope had chas'd each ling'ring fear, ‘When all my fond expectancies drew near, ‘When love and fortune smil'd—joy turn'd aside, ‘And left me, plung'd in woe, misfortune's bride: ‘To the swift progress of disease a prey, ‘On death's terrific couch Rodolphus lay; ‘As sorrow-wounded o'er his form I bent, ‘His closing voice these accents feebly sent:— “The Pow'r above, whose will we must obey, “Who tears me now from thee and joy away, “Late saw me at the conscious altar bow, “And heard these lips pronounce the hallow'd vow, “Beneath the banner of the Cross to stand, “And scourge th' usurpers of the Holy Land. “This unaccomplish'd vow to thee I leave, “With stedfast ear my parting words receive: “In the small compass of an urn enshrin'd, “To some bold warrior be my heart consign'd, “To live with him when his intrepid hand “Shall scourge th' usurpers of the Holy Land.” ‘He ceas'd—his fading eyes now roll'd in vain, ‘Now clos'd—and never gaz'd on me again It was not unusual, during the long period of the Crusades, for the knights to make this request upon their death-beds. Among other instances, see particularly one mentioned by Froissart, in his first volume, chapter 21; where the king of Scotland entreats Douglas to embalm his heart immediately after his decease, in order to carry it with him to the holy war.. ‘No bold advent'rous war-bred youth I sought, ‘For love inspir'd me with a bolder thought: ‘I dropt the robe that deck'd the peaceful maid, ‘And, in the warrior's garb of steel array'd, ‘Amidst the embattled ranks unknown I stood, ‘Beneath the banner of the holy rood. ‘As in their urn Rodolphus' ashes slept, ‘I bore them to the plain where Rachel wept. ‘Peace to the souls of Archers that were hurl'd ‘In that dread moment to another world! ‘Fierce from the hands of hostile Pagans flung, ‘Dark o'er the field a cloud of jav'lins hung. ‘Still to this mind returns (dismiss'd in vain) ‘The thund'ring tumult of the horrid plain. ‘At length our daring men, to valor true, ‘The fiery-tressed Saracens o'erthrew: ‘Still dost thou ask what charm, what sacred pow'r, ‘Upheld my frame in danger's rudest hour? ‘Behold, behold the wonder-working charm Taking the urn from her garment., ‘That calm'd my fear in danger's rude alarm: ‘This little tomb, that clasps his better part, ‘Where sleep the ashes of his spotless heart, ‘This relic, as it touch'd my conscious breast, ‘My fainting soul with energy imprest. ‘Enough—soon as the flag of truce unfurl'd ‘Its softer color to the Pagan world, ‘To England then I urg'd my lonesome way, ‘Cloath'd in this pilgrim garb of amice grey: ‘Still as the tenor of my way I kept, ‘O'er thee, oh Father! fond remembrance wept: ‘Oft did I say, while tears roll'd down my face, ‘(And as I spoke I mov'd with quicker pace) ‘By Time's devasting hand despoil'd of friends, ‘Unspous'd, undaughter'd, my lov'd parent bends; ‘Like desolation, all unfenc'd he shews, ‘Expos'd and naked to assailing woes. ‘I go, I go his sorrows to assuage, ‘To smooth with filial hand the couch of age: ‘Ply duty's task, whose labors never tire, ‘Invent young sports to chear his evening fire; ‘The joy I cannot feel to him impart, ‘And brighten with his smiles my drooping heart.’ ‘Forbear, forbear!’ th' enraptur'd Father cries, (While tears of gladness glitter in his eyes) ‘Oh insupportable! oh joyful hour! ‘That bursts upon me in a flood of pow'r.’ He ceas'd—and to the moat-encircled dome In triumph led the beauteous wand'rer home; Where at the castle-gate expecting staid A num'rous train to greet the welcome Maid. Mean-while the jocund villagers convene, Where the wreath'd may-pole crowns the festive green; The comely maids the gifted ribband wear, Gay-streaming from the flow'r-encircled hair. See with the am'rous youths they now advance, Demand the music, and provoke the dance; Link'd hand in hand they form the mirthful round, Obedient to the shrill pipe's nimble sound. Thus on the flowing stream of time, the day With prosp'rous sails glides rapidly away, Till, as the faint beams glimmer from the west, The curfew tolls the hamlet train to rest. A beautiful Picture, taken from the Ancient Wake, by Hamilton, is to be seen in Macklin's Gallery. INSCRIPTION INTENDED FOR AN OLD THATCHED CHURCH. Far from the splendor of a costly fane, My low roof canopies the humble train: Deep in my vaults, divorc'd from human woes, The life-worn weary villagers repose: When at my altar kneels the hamlet Fair, And to her God unveils her bosom'd care: Or does the herdsman bend with grief distrest, Kind comfort steals upon their lighten'd breast: Here too Religion weaves, with viewless hand, For spotless village hearts, the nuptial band, And twines with many a charm the holy braid That joins the lab'rer and the nut-brown maid. ON THE DEATH of Two Favourite Birds. Involv'd in flame and suffocating breath, A hapless bird was doom'd to sudden death; The female, touch'd at his uncommon fate, Survey'd the form of her disfigur'd mate; With drooping head and shiv'ring wings she stood, In all the agony of widowhood! At length, to grief's severest pow'r a prey, She dropt—and sigh'd her little soul away. Ye wedded birds, tho' rigid be your doom, Yet Anna The Honourable Mrs. Talbot. watches at your early tomb; For you her flowing pity bursts restraint, Your dirge is utter'd in her soft complaint, Your elegy, without the poet's art, Is writ by sorrow on the purest heart. SENSIBILITY. Celestial spring! to Nature's favourites giv'n, Fed by the dews that bathe the flow'rs of heav'n: From the pure crystal of thy fountain flow The tears that trickle o'er another's woe; The silent drop that calms our own distress; The gush of rapture at a friend's success; Thine the soft show'rs down Beauty's breast that steal, To sooth the heart-wounds they can never heal: Thine too the tears of ecstacy that roll, When Genius rushes on the ravish'd soul; And thine the hallow'd flood that drowns the eye, When warm Religion lifts the thought on high. THE SOLDIER's FAREWELL, ON THE EVE OF A BATTLE. Night, expecting the dread morrow, Hover'd o'er the martial train; Beauteous Alice, led by sorrow, Hurried to the silent plain: ‘Give the watch-word!’ the guard utter'd Loudly from his destin'd place; ‘Lo! 'tis I,’ fair Alice mutter'd Hastening to his fond embrace. ‘Ever beauteous, faithful ever,’ Quick the gallant Youth rejoin'd ‘Cruel Death can only sever ‘Hearts in love's strong links entwin'd. ‘Soon shall we be torn asunder, ‘Therefore welcome art thou come: ‘Till morn wakes the battle's thunder ‘Rest thee on that broken drum.’ She sat down, in mind reviewing Ills the morning might behold, Tears still other tears pursuing, Down her cheek in silence roll'd: Thoughts to other thoughts succeeding O'er her mind incessant flow; She, like Meekness, inly-bleeding, Broods in stillness o'er her woe: ‘Wherefore, Alice, dost thou ponder ‘Evils that are Fancy's brood? ‘Sure our parting might be fonder ‘Than beseems this silent mood: ‘Yet continue still to ponder ‘Things thy voice wants pow'r to say, ‘Thy dumb grief to me seems fonder ‘Than words deck'd in bright array.’ She replied (her tears still gushing) ‘What avails it to be brave? ‘Thou, amidst the battle rushing, ‘Here perchance may'st meet a grave: ‘Should'st thou perish in the action, ‘Where's the peace to sooth my care? ‘All my life would be distraction, ‘Madness, wailing, and despair. ‘Still thou wert of gentlest carriage, ‘Still affectionately true, ‘And a lover still in marriage, ‘And a friend and parent too.’ ‘Cheer thee, cheer thee, best of women, ‘Trust to the great Pow'r above; ‘When I rush amidst the foemen, ‘Heav'n may think on her I love. ‘Saving is the Miser's pleasure, ‘Spending is the Soldier's thrift; ‘Take this guinea, all my treasure, ‘Take it—as a parting gift. ‘Here end we this mournful meeting, ‘Catch from my lips this fond sigh; ‘If this be our last, last greeting, ‘Know, that I was born to die. ‘See! the day-spring gilds the streamers ‘Waving o'er the martial train; ‘Now the hoarse drum wakes the dreamers, ‘Ne'er perchance to dream again: ‘Hark! I hear the trumpet's clangor ‘Bid the British youth excel; ‘Now, now glows the battle's anger: ‘Lovely Alice, fare thee well!’ ALBINA. ADVERTISEMENT. The subject of these Stanzas is not founded upon a fiction. The young woman was cruelly deluded by a man who was already married: The mock ceremonial of a marriage took place in ITALY: She soon after returned to ENGLAND, and going into a sequestered part of the country, devoted herself to retirement. Would Genius to my fond demand My earnest bold request bestow, A vivid pencil to this hand, Dipt in the brilliant vernal bow: How eager would I then engage (With faithful and unerring aim) To paint on the poetic page Albina's elegance of frame! Her tresses—dark with auburn hue: Her brow serene—young Candour's throne: Her timid eye—whose languid blue Sheds charms peculiarly its own. Her cheek—that wears a lively glow: Not after the fresh morning show'r Can Italy's rich summer show, On all her banks so bright a flow'r. Her cherry lip—inviting bliss, Where Love deliciously reposes, Accompanied by many a kiss, On fragrant leaves of breathing roses. Yet who can paint her beauteous mind? There Innocence has fix'd her seat; There easy wit, and taste refin'd, And sentiment and knowledge meet. Love, who oft whelms the Fair in woe, Soon robb'd her guileless mind of rest: Affection's flame dissolv'd the snow That lodg'd within her spotless breast. As still the East the morn-beams streak, And gild the portal of the day, So did her morning thought still break On the same Youth with Ardour's ray: As the last glimm'rings of the sky Pause on the lake, ere they expire, Each night her thought (as clos'd her eye) Died on the Youth of her desire. The nuptials eager to profane, The bold, unfeeling, treach'rous Youth Led the chaste Maiden to the fane With all the mockery of Truth. Hypocrisy with downcast air, Profaneness with an atheist eye, And Lust with a malignant leer, Remark'd the mock-connubial tie. No sooner had the Youth prevail'd, Successful in his impious aim, He left the drooping Fair, assail'd By Grief, by Infamy, and Shame. 'Twas then the beauteous Mourner woo'd Meek Quiet, in her lonely seat, Where Competency watchful strew'd Her sober treasures at her feet. I'll not the little path-way tell That winds to thy sequester'd scene; Where Virtue loves with thee to dwell, Remote—unseeing and unseen. Where Resignation takes her stand, Prompt to perform her friendly part, And gathers with a trembling hand The fragments of a broken heart. TO THE LATE Earl of CHESTERFIELD. Reclin'd beneath thy shade, Blackheath! From politics and strife apart; His temples twin'd with laurel-wreath, And Virtue smiling at his heart: Will Chesterfield the Muse allow To break upon his still retreat; To view if health still smooths his brow, And prints his grove with willing feet? 'Twas this awak'd the present theme, And bade it reach thy distant ear; Where, if no rays of Genius beam, Sincerity at least is there. May pale Disease fly far aloof, O'er venal domes its flag display; And Health beneath thy peaceful roof Add lustre to thy evening ray! If this my fervent wish be crown'd, I'll dress with flow'rs the godhead's shrine:— Nor thou, with Wisdom's chaplet bound, At any absent gift repine. What tho' thou dost not grace a throne, While subjects bend the supple knee; No other king the Muses own, And Science lifts her eye to thee. Tho' Deafness, by a doom severe, Steals from thy ear the murm'ring rill, Or Philomel's delightful air; E'en deem not this a partial ill. Ah! if anew thine ear was strung, Awake to ev'ry voice around; Thy praises, by the many sung, Would stun thee with the choral sound. ON THE DEATH OF Mr. GARRICK, 1779. O hallow'd Censer! form'd by magic pow'r To waft the incense of bright Avon's flow'r! Those airy forms, by glowing Truth design'd, Which proudly issued from the Poet's mind, No longer realis'd by Garrick's art, Rush on the scene, and rouse the throbbing heart: Macbeth.Ambition—prompt to seize th' imperial reins, Who hospitality's pure rite profanes, And sees (as wildly his strain'd eye-balls glare) The fatal dagger trav'ling thro' the air: Hamlet.Affection—who, half-daring, half-dismay'd, Pursues with anxious steps a Father's shade: As th' awful form stalks solemnly along, Dread Expectation chills the circling throng: Richard the Third.Proud Cruelty—beside a languid lamp, Who 'mid the stillness of the slumb'ring camp, Amid the terrors of the lonesome night, Sits deeply musing on the morrow's fight: 'Till worn with thought, with many a care opprest, He drops the world, and wearies into rest: In vain—Remorse now bids her serpents roll In horrid volumes round his tortur'd soul: Lear.Old-age—who banish'd from his native throne, Forc'd from the door so lately call'd his own, Stands muttering to the foul and midnight air (In beggar'd robes) the accents of Despair: Unreverenc'd, shunn'd, rejected, and revil'd, Stung at the mockery of an impious child, And while the big tears trickle from his eyes, I gave you all, the generous Father cries; Let the fierce spirit of the tempest shed The raging torrent on this hoary head; The worst is past, let the loud thunder burst, The drooping Sire is by a Daughter curst. These were the scenes late held to Britain's view, On which she gaz'd with transport ever new: Endearing scenes! Ah! never to return, While Genius sorrows o'er a Garrick's urn. ON THE AUTHOR OF THE BALLAD CALLED THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD. Let others praise the martial song, Which rushes as a flood, And round the harp attentive throng That honours deeds of blood: Let me that humble Bard revere, Tho' artless be his theme, Who snatch'd the tale to Pity dear, From dark Oblivion's stream. Say, little Mary The daughter of Sir Thomas Beauchamp, of Langley Park, in Norfolk., prattling maid, (Whose wit thine age excels) Beneath what holy yew-tree's shade Thy favourite Author dwells? Ah! not on Westminster's proud ground The fond enquiry waste: Go where the meek of heart are found, And th' unambitious rest. Where Walton's limpid streamlet flows, On Norfolk's rich domain, A gently-rising hillock shews The hamlet's straw-roof'd fane. Hard by is seen a marble stone, By many a winter worn; Forgetfulness around has thrown The rude o'ermantling thorn: Within this low obscure abode Fame says the Bard is laid; Oft have I left the beaten road To greet the Poet's shade. Fame too reports, that when the bier Receiv'd the Poet's frame, The neighb'ring Hamlets hasten'd here, And all the Childhood came: Attir'd in white, an Infant Band Advanc'd in long array; With rosemary-leaves each little hand O'erspread the mournful way: Encircling now the Poet's tomb, Thrice on his name they call, And thrice into the hallow'd gloom Sweet show'rs of violets fall. Compassion's Priest! oh! feeling Bard, Who melts the heart away, Enduring praise shall still reward Thy short and simple lay. Those shall thy praise be found among Whom Nature's touch has grac'd, The warm of heart applaud thy song, And all the pure of taste: The Child shall leave his jocund dance, Suppress his frolic mood, And bend to hear, in silent trance, The Story of the Wood. TO LADY CATHARINE MURRAY, DURING HER RECOVERY FROM AN ILLNESS, OCCASIONED BY HER CLOATHS CATCHING FIRE, 1781. With a green and yellow Melancholy she sat, like Patience on A monument, smiling at grief. Shakispear. Had our great tragic Bard (whose master-hand The patient Viola's sweet portrait plann'd) Beheld fair Catharine to pain consign'd, Yet tow'ring o'er her fate with strength of mind, In other colours he had then display'd The pleasing image of his patient Maid! Not with dim tints of yellow and of green, Would he have sicklied o'er the sufferer's mien: But in a shading cap that veils the face, Half-stealing from the sight each soften'd grace, He would have pictur'd to the stedfast view A cheek a little pal'd with languor's hue; An eye that, beaming with the rays of sense, Speaks to the soul an artless eloquence, And seems a look of gratitude to throw On those whose feelings share the sufferer's woe: And last her lips (whose blushes well display The glowing colour of the ruby's ray) Where Patience dwells, refusing to complain, With Resignation This accomplished young lady was married, in 1782, to the Honourable Edward Bouverie, and died in 1783. that can smile at pain! TO A LADY, WHO LAMENTED SHE COULD NOT SING. ‘Oh! give to Lydia, ye blest Pow'rs,’ I cried, ‘A voice!’ the only gift ye have denied.— ‘A voice!’ says Venus, with a laughing air, ‘A voice! strange object of a Lover's pray'r! ‘Say—shall your chosen Fair resemble most ‘Yon Philomel, whose voice is all her boast? ‘Or, curtain'd round with leaves, yon mournful Dove, ‘That hoarsely murmurs to the conscious grove?’ —‘Still more unlike,’ I said, ‘be Lydia's note ‘The pleasing tone of Philomela's throat, ‘So to the hoarseness of the murm'ring Dove ‘She joins ('tis all I ask) the Turtle's love.’ A SONNET to the Book These lines were sent to Lady Jersey, with a former edition of these Poems. Ah go! beyond thy kindred copies blest, Go meet thy happiness—be Jersey's guest: She, skill'd to judge, thy humble themes receives, Her graceful hand shall touch thy trembling leaves: Her eyes, the boast and envy of the age, Shall shed their pleasing lustre o'er thy page: And while she reads, thy conscious form shall feel The breath of spring from lips celestial steal. FEBRUARY 4th, 1785. Ye radiant Fair! ye Hebes of the day, Who heedless laugh your little hour away! Let Caution be your guide, when next ye sport Within the precincts of the splendid court: Th' event of yesterday Alluding to Mrs. Montagu's fall, the preceding day, as she was going down the stairs at St. James's. for prudence calls, 'Tis dangerous treading when Minerva falls. HONORIA: OR, THE DAY OF ALL SOULS. A POEM. ADVERTISEMENT. The Scene of the following little Poem is supposed to be in the great church of St AMBROSE at MILAN, the second of November, on which day the most solemn office is performed for the repose of the Dead. ‘Ye hallow'd bells, whose voices thro' the air ‘The awful summons of affliction bear: ‘Ye slowly-waving banners of the dead, ‘That o'er yon altar your dark horrors spread: ‘Ye curtain'd lamps, whose mitigated ray ‘Casts round the fane a pale, reluctant day: ‘Ye walls, ye shrines, by Melancholy drest, ‘Well do ye suit the fashion of my breast! ‘Have I not lost what language can't unfold, ‘The form of Valour, cast in Beauty's mould? ‘Th' intrepid Youth the path of battle tried, ‘And foremost in the hour of peril died. ‘Nor was I present to bewail his fate, ‘With pity's lenient voice to sooth his state, ‘To watch his looks, to read, while Death stood by, ‘The last expression of his parting eye. ‘But other duties, other cares impend, ‘Cares that beyond the mournful grave extend: ‘Now, now I view conven'd the pious train, ‘Whose bosom sorrows at another's pain, ‘While recollection, pleasingly severe, ‘Wakes for the awful dead the silent tear, ‘And pictures (as to each her sway extends) ‘The sacred forms of lovers, parents, friends. ‘Now Charity a fiery seraph stands ‘Beside yon altar with uplifted hands. ‘Yet, can this high solemnity of grief ‘Yield to the Youth I love the wish'd relief? ‘These rites of death—ah! what can they avail? ‘Honorius died beyond the hallow'd pale. ‘Plung'd in the gulph of fear—distressful state! ‘My anxious mind abhors to know his fate: ‘Yet why despond? could one slight error roll ‘A flood of poison o'er the healthful soul? ‘Had not thy virtues full sufficing pow'r ‘To clear thee in the dread recording hour? ‘Did they before the Judge abash'd remain? ‘Did they, weak advocates, all plead in vain? ‘By love, by piety, by reason taught, ‘My soul revolts at the blaspheming thought: ‘Sure, in the breast to pure religion true, ‘Where Virtue's templed, God is templed too. ‘Then, while th' august procession moves along, ‘'Midst swelling organs, and the pomp of song; ‘While the dread chaunt, still true to Nature's laws, ‘Is deepen'd by the terror-breathing pause; ‘While 'midst encircling clouds of incense lost ‘The trembling priest upholds the sacred host; ‘Amid these scenes shall I forget my suit? ‘Amid these scenes shall I alone be mute? ‘Nor to the footsteps of the throne above ‘Breathe the warm requiem to the Youth I love? ‘Now silence reigns along the gloomy fane, ‘And wraps in dread repose the pausing strain: ‘When next it bursts, my humble voice I'll join, ‘Disclose my trembling wish at Mercy's shrine, ‘Unveil my anguish to the throne above, ‘And sigh the requiem to the Youth I love. ‘—Does Fancy mock me with a false delight, ‘Or does some hallow'd vision cheer my sight? ‘Methinks, emerging from the gloom below, ‘Th' immortal spirits leave the house of woe! ‘Inshrin'd in Glory's beams they reach the sky, ‘While choral songs of triumph burst from high! ‘See, at the voice of my accorded pray'r, ‘The radiant Youth ascend the fields of air! ‘Behold!—he mounts unutterably bright, ‘Cloath'd in the sun-robe of unfading light! ‘Applauding Seraphs hail him on his way, ‘And lead him to the gates of everlasting day.’ END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II THE SHAKSPEARE GALLERY. ADVERTISEMENT. The following Poem does not pass any judgment upon the Pictures that are now exhibited in the Gallery; but attempts to point out new subjects for future Exhibitions: And, in the delineation of new subjects, attention is paid to the principle laid down by our late great Painter, (in his notes to the translation of Fresnoy by Mr. Mason) “That palpable situation “is preferable to curious sentiment, as the Painter speaks to the eye.” As mus'd the Prophet near mild Chebar's stream EZEKIEL, Chap. 8th., And pray'd his God to dart th' enlight'ning gleam, Abrupt-descending from his airy height, A form angelic rush'd upon his sight! With smiling lip he cheer'd the hallow'd Sire, And bad his soul to Heav'n's best gift aspire: Then, with strong hand, he grasp'd his silver hair, And swift convey'd him thro' the yielding air, Along the unknown region of the sky, The dread, mysterious, deep abyss on high. There Inspiration her bright cloud withdrew, And pour'd her visions on his daring view: Then on his rapture-kindled eye arose Those forms of splendor, those terrific shows, With which he peopled his celestial dream, And swell'd his proud magnificence of theme. To England's Leading Bard thus Genius came, Envelop'd in a robe of holy flame, And bore him, with a whirlwind's rapid force, Beyond the solar road, and starry course; From which far tow'ring and tremendous height (While now he hovers with suspended flight) The Poet view'd, as on a spacious plain, Of human passions the long shadowy train: 'Twas then the favor'd Bard receiv'd the lore, (Whose mystic veil was ne'er remov'd before) That revelation to his instinct giv'n, That ray from God, the energy of Heav'n. To his illumin'd sight was then consign'd The deep recesses of the Human Mind; The ever-varying path of tortuous Art, And the dark passage to the Tyrant's heart; Th' umbrageous winding of the thorny road, That leads to quick-ey'd Jealousy's abode; The gath'ring storms that o'er Resentment roll; The swelling waves that toss the fearful soul; The calm that breathes around the Infant's rest, The rugged cavern of the Murd'rer's breast; The dread materials by the Furies brought, With which are forg'd Despair's tempestuous thought; The shaft, that, mingling pleasure with the pain, Bathes in the blood that warms the Lover's vein. Oh Thou! th' Imperial Genius of our land! Take a fresh garland from thy country's hand; Triumphs unknown she hastens to proclaim, And stamp a new-born era on thy fame! Too long, as with the iron power of Fate, Hath Custom bolted the Historic Gate; Enlighten'd Boydell bursts th' opposing bar, On their rude hinge the pond'rous portals jar; While the rapt Arts salute, with loud acclaim, This rich accession to their rising name. Genius of Painting! thy bright car ascend, Bid glowing Energy thy steps attend, Triumphant ride thro' the unrifled land, And seize thy plunder with victorious hand. Oft have we heard the pure of taste complain Of mawkish Portraiture's eternal reign; Of exhibitions which the art disgrace, And pall the eye with many a vacant face. Let Miniature erect her fairy school, And 'mid her gewgaws unmolested rule; Let her bright dome each pleas'd Narcissus seek, To her let Beauty told her summer cheek! Let her delineate, on her iv'ry plane, The nuptial simper of the happy swain! From these we turn to scenes of higher aim, Where Eagle-Genius soars to nobler game; Where Fancy, Reason, Taste, in one conjoin'd, Unfold the workings of th' impassion'd mind. Now to the laurell'd, academic band, To ev'ry Artist's emulative hand, Munificence upholds her sacred prize, And bids the daring reach it from the skies. While Expectation lifts the thought on high, Methinks I view, with a prophetic eye, In solemn state ascend that splendid Dome, Where the proud Arts shall find an equal home; Where, at the opening of some glorious day, The English mind its treasures shall display; While they, whose taste is sway'd by Rigor's rule, Shall mark the wonders of the Albion School Another gallery is to be erected, for the purpose of receiving the whole collection, when completed.. If time shou'd e'er obliterate the gold Of Shakspeare's language, cast in Vigor's mould Here shall, invested in their various guise, The throng of his departed Forms arise! The splendid forms his mind luxuriant drew, The bold creations he held forth to view, As from their grave shall burst the num'rous host, And on these walls a new existence boast. Here shall be seen, in all her charms array'd, Th' impressive figure of Verona's Maid JULIET.: Clos'd in the dreary vault where sleep the dead, Wrapp'd in the night-dress of the fun'ral bed, She breaks abruptly from her iron trance, And sends around a terror-rolling glance: A mournful, solitary lamp shall throw A sickly glimm'ring o'er the house of woe, And shall the wretched Paris give to view, Stretch'd on the ground, with mien of ghastly hue: Then shall a deeper spectacle display, And hang o'er Romeo with reluctant ray, Disclosing his wan lips, devoid of breath, And faint-ros'd cheek, still beautiful in death: Then shall the beam, with weaken'd effort, shed A fading glory on the Friar's head. She too shall ornament the pictur'd scene, The destin'd victim of Italian spleen IMOGEN.: See the base wretch perform his treach'rous part, With all the subtlety of finish'd art! Behold him bending o'er the sleeping Maid, Her holy form to his research betray'd! Eager some secret notice to retail, With rav'nous aim he lifts the slender veil, And leering marks, by Nature's hand imprest, The mole cinque-spotted on her snowy breast; Whose scatter'd drops to the rapt eye excel The crimson spots within the cowslip's bell. Here too, as patient as the meek-ey'd dove, Shall stand the Maid who “never told her love VIOLA.;” Who, to her coy and fearful bosom true, (As th' unseen worm, that pales the blossom's hue) Still let concealment on her beauty prey, Like snow dissolving silently away. Now, at the magic Painter's wild command, Girt with the sea, ascends th' Enchanted Land! There stands Simplicity's endearing Child MIRANDA., That artless Maid! the flow'ret of the wild! Beside the margin of the wave-vex'd shore, While all around conflicting thunders roar, With unbound tresses, flutt'ring to the wind, Her eye expressive of her tortur'd mind, She views the vessel, by the surges tost, Now seen—now lost—now found—now once more lost: Till, madly rushing on the pointed rock, Its bosom riven with the forceful shock, Beyond the stretch of naval art to save, Down, down, it hurries to the watery grave! Now Prospero comes, with magic arts endu'd, His sable garb with hieroglyphics strew'd; Long care, long study, solitude profound, Has deepen'd on his brow reflection's wound; His low-descending hair, o'erblanch'd with age, Becomes the Sorc'rer, and adorns the Sage: Ah! view him at that dread, momentous hour, While he abjures his necromantic pow'r! Within the ring of Incantation's ground, Elves, Fairies, Spirits, Demons, flock around: Beneath his foot behold the potent wand, Doom'd ne'er again to grace his lifted hand! Behold the volume, which (with myst'ry fraught) Predestination's darkling edicts taught, And breath'd its solemn whispers on the mind, With dust o'erspread, and to neglect consign'd! Yet then the distant scenery imparts A dire remembrance of his former arts: The bright sun fading in his full career, The wild stars madly starting from their sphere, The storm-encumber'd sky, the swelling main, Th' uprooted cedars stretching o'er the plain, The mountain loosen'd by convulsive throe, With ruin rushing to the vale below, And the pale wretch, reversing Nature's doom, Abruptly rising from the rifted tomb! What glowing Artist with bold hand shall claim To draw, Oh Ariel! thy resplendent frame? Thou tricksy Spirit with benignant smile, Thou playful meteor of th' Enchanted Isle! Not like a sea-nymph, rob'd in sickly green, With dappled wings, as on the Stage thou'rt seen, A gay transparency shalt thou appear, Thy form celestial melting into air, With foot light-touching some fantastic height, Prompt to depart, and stretching to thy flight. Yet, ere we sail from this Enchanted Isle, Let other scenes our ling'ring steps beguile: There stands Anthonio, the suggesting fiend, And half reveals his purpose to his friend; His bosom swells, his madd'ning eye-balls roll, And shew the workings of his inmost soul. All that his lawless, wild conceptions dare, In various forms hang hov'ring in the air: A sword fresh-tainted with Alonzo's blood, A sceptre swimming in a crimson flood, A crown with dazzling ornaments o'erspread, And lightly floating o'er Sebastian's head; While, in the distance, rising o'er the bay, Imperial Naples shall her tow'rs display. Lo! now, advancing on the mimic scene, Comes forth to view the fam'd Egyptian Queen ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA, Act 1st, Scene 3d, at the end.; While anxious doubts her Soldier's mind perplex, Behold her rise instructive to her sex! Ah, not superior! for the female heart Endures with fortitude the suff'ring part. Tow'ring beyond the flight of tim'rous love, She bids her Warrior from her sight remove; She points her finger to the martial plain, Points to the active and the daring train: The threat'ning axes which the Fasces bear; The gorgeous streamers swelling to the air; Of busy legions the thick murm'ring swarms; The thronging shields, and high emblazon'd arms; Th' encumbering elephant, the rapid steed, And spoils of former conquest, Glory's meed; Flush'd Conquest, riding in his trophied car, And all the dread magnificence of war. Now shall the fell, tremendous act be done: The Thane MACBETH. appears!—the warning clock strikes One! His daring, wild imaginings create (Such the hot chaos of his mental state) The air-born dagger, and display to view The point obscene, distain'd with crimson hue. Still, as we gaze, shall new creations rise, And varying sceneries prolong surprise: Ere yet the sky-lark leaves his lowly bed, Bright on the mist-encircled mountain's head, See jocund Day on airy tiptoe stand, And ope the gates of Heav'n with radiant hand! Now, like two lions litter'd on one day JULIUS CÆSAR, Act 4th, Scene 3d., Who range the dreary wilds, and share the prey, I see, in dreadful harmony combin'd, Th' illustrious Pair who dignify mankind! The summer-cloud, that dimm'd their friendship's ray, The passing summer-gale hath borne away; Yet Cassius then upbraids th' unmanly grief, That from the moral Porch claims no relief: With low'ring aspect, but with tearless eyes, The grief-torn, inly-bleeding friend replies: “Ah! not in vain was I with Stoics bred, “For yet art thou to learn, that Portia's dead.” The hair-dishevell'd Prophetess of Troy TROILUS AND CRESSIDA, Act 5th, Scene 3d. Shall next the Painter's hallow'd hand employ: She with bold Divination's meteor-eye, Pervades the awful secrets of the sky; The woes of her lov'd country she foretels, And on her brother's death prolixly dwells. Andromache, impress'd with tender fears, At the prophetic strain dissolves in tears; While Hector's scorn-denouncing looks upbraid The vapoury day-dreams of the wild'ring Maid: While Priam, bending at the weight of age, Rever'd, parental, patriarchal Sage! Half credits, half rejects, the tragic tale, Till terrors o'er his fading hopes prevail. Whence yonder radiant form, that charms the eye? 'Tis Expectation, riding through the sky! A sword-like instrument she waves around, Enwreath'd with coronets, with chaplets bound, Prepar'd for Henry and his faithful train, Eager to urge the war o'er Gallia's plain. Behold the Legate from the sacred Dome KING JOHN, Act 3d, Scene 4th., In the rich garb of sacerdotal Rome!— Constance approaches! spurning at relief, Attir'd in all the negligence of grief: In her fierce grasp she shews her rooted hair, Presenting well the image of Despair; And seem to cry aloud, in accents wild, “He talks to me, who never had a child!” Mark where the blood-fed lamps, with crimson ray HENRY SIXTH, Part II. Act 1st, Scene 4th., The ragged entrails of a cave display: On a dread pile of human bones, her throne, Sits, in rude pomp, th' emaciated Crone; She lifts a pale and wither'd hand on high, And on the Phantom rolls her savage eye, Whose doubtful form confounds th' enquiring sight, One part reveal'd, the other lost in night; From this abhorr'd interpreter of fate, The Hag demands the future storms of state, When the Sixth Henry, prince of dim renown, Shall lose, what ill becomes him—England's crown. Ye, who to martial fame your spirit yield, Who pant to reap the honours of the field, See the Third Edward, from the mountain's brow, Survey, with madd'ning glance, the plain below: He there beholds (by sacred Glory won) In Danger's van his dear and godlike Son: He views with wonder, and with mingled fear, (His eye-lid glist'ning with Affection's tear) With pride, applause, and with a Father's joy, The first achievements of th' immortal Boy HENRY FIFTH, Act 1st, Scene 2d.! Lo! the Eighth Henry, from his doubts releas'd, Devotes to infamy th' aspiring Priest HENRY EIGHTH, Act 3d, Scene 2d.: The Monarch hails him as he passes by, With ruin leaping from his threat'ning eye: The Prelate, struck as by the blast of Death, Looks the scath'd oak upon the naked heath. The distant scene shall yield illumin'd night, With one star falling from its airy height, Thy emblem, Wolsey!—thou wast England's star, And thy rich lustre dazzled from afar; Till thou (too daring) wast, by public hate, Flung from the splendor of thy tow'ring state. With fearful steps we now approach the bed Where Scotland's King reclines his weary head: Mark, mark the savage Thane's MACBETH. more savage Wife, Who brandishes aloft the thirsty knife! One moment—and the victim is no more; One moment—and he welters in his gore! When sudden, thro' her soul's encircling night, Flashes a glimm'ring of a moral light: O'er the calm features of the sleeping Guest She sees her Father's image full exprest Act 2d, Scene 2d.—Lady Macbeth. “Had he not resembled my Father as he slept, I had don't.”! 'Tis Nature's miracle!—the Fiend relents, Her alter'd mien a sickly smile presents; Affection subjugates her lawless soul, Her bosom heaves, and tears begin to roll. Say, to whose proud ambition shall be giv'n A pencil glowing with the tints of Heav'n, With which the wild Enthusiast shall aspire To body forth th' ecstatic Muse of Fire HENRY FIFTH, the Prologue. “O for a Muse of Fire, that would ascend “The brightest heaven of Invention!”? At the gay opening of the splendid sky The Seraph enters, with commanding eye, Her radiant visitant Invention hails, And all her waste magnificence reveals: A diamond-rock sustains the gorgeous Queen, That flings a brilliance o'er th' expansive scene; The various Arts their sovereign Mistress own, And bend with low obeisance at her throne: See, to the Muse the Goddess holds a crown, Bright on whose front is character'd “RENOWN!” A subject now unfolds of meeker claim AS YOU LIKE IT, Act 2d, Scene 3d., Yet seeks the heart with unresisted aim: The faithful Servant on the scene appears, Impress'd, but not o'ercharg'd with weight of years: The glow of health still blushes on his cheek, As on the winter-fruit the ruddy streak: His tearful eyes his Master's wants behold, And to those wants he yields the hoarded gold: Methinks he says, “With this thy care assuage; “For me, let Him be comfort to my age, “Whose tender providence the Raven feeds, “And to the Sparrow yields the daily seeds.” See where the chisel, with victorious strife, Has urg'd the torpid matter into life! Lo! the bold Roman to our view consign'd, His air reflective of his haughty mind; Spite of the foldings of a mean disguise, His frame majestic strikes th' admiring eyes: So the tall vessel, shatter'd by the storm, Retains her native dignity of form: Behold him, at the hour of conscious pride, And prompting worth, to confidence allied, What time he utters, with commanding air, “My name breathes terror on a Volscian ear!” This high, heroic task, by Genius plann'd, Avows th' impression of a female hand See the Basso-Relievo by the Honourable Ann Damer.—CORIOLANUS, Act 4th, Scene 5th.: Illustrious Damer! tho' thy splendid name Decks, like a star, the pinnacle of fame, Yet only they who mark, with aspect near, The humbler orb of thy domestic sphere, Can tell (from all the rougher parts refin'd) How Learning sits enamell'd on thy mind: How still, thro' various life's eventful scene, Thy friendship wears th' unfading robe of green!— NOR shall each task unfold the solemn scene Hung with the drap'ry of the Tragic Queen: With airy step Thalia shall advance, And dart around her grief-expelling glance, Group the fantastic forms of Humour's court, And bid the Pleasures o'er the landscape sport.

See where the Birds forsake the realms of air See the Poems.—“The Passionate Pilgrim,” at the end., And to yon melancholy spot repair; Where press the bier those images of love, The radiant Phenix and the faithful Dove: Just o'er the summit of the funeral pyre, Wak'd by the gale, ascends the sacred fire. There Philomela swells her little throat, To grace the requiem with her saddest note: There too the pitying Red-breast shall be seen, And in his bill a leaf of purest green: The Swallow shall his circling sport forego, And join this meek society of woe: The joyous Sky-lark, by compassion won, Shall check his wonted anthem to the sun, And, swift-descending from his radiant height, Devote his music to the hallow'd rite. E'en birds shall here be seen of ampler form, Who slowly sail, and dare the gath'ring storm: The Vulture here shall come, at Sorrow's call, And the dark Raven spread his hov'ring pall: The Bird of Jove shall from his heav'n descend, And with this train his awful presence blend. Ye who, with finer sympathies imprest, Avow th' immaculate and feeling breast, O white-stol'd Virgins! in long order move, True to the ritual of the cypress grove; And, while your souls with chaste affection burn, With garlands deck the emblematic urn. Ah! now the zeal that warms my throbbing heart For all who honor the Poetic Art, Ferments my bosom to this strong desire, That He who led the Bard's theatric quire, Whom England mourns—recording still his name, Who grappled to his own his Shakspeare's fame, That He, by Sculptor imag'd, here may stand, In act to speak what his great Idol plann'd. Thus have we travers'd the extensive plain, Mark'd where the mine contains the swelling vein; Mark'd where the chosen trees their branches shoot, And pluck'd the leaves that veil the Golden Fruit! [[ON THE RESIGNATION OF SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.]] THE FOLLOWING LINES Were written on the Occasion of the late Sir Joshua Reynolds' resigning the President's Chair at the Royal Academy.

Yet he first enter'd on the barren land, And rais'd on high Armida's pow'rful wand: From him the Academics boast a name, He led the way, he smooth'd their path to fame: From him th' instructive lore the pupils claim'd, His doctrine nurtur'd, and his voice inflam'd! Oh, and is all forgot?—The sons rebel, And, Regan-like, their hallow'd Sire expel. Cou'd not his faculties, so meekly borne, Arrest the hand that fix'd the rankling thorn? Cou'd not the twilight of approaching age, The silver hairs that crown th' indulgent Sage, Domestic virtues, his time-honour'd name, His radiant works that crowd the dome of fame, Say, cou'd not these suppress th' opprobrious scene, And charm to slumber academic spleen? Mark, mark the period, when the Children stung The Parent's feelings with their serpent tongue; It was while dimness veil'd the pow'rs of sight, The calamity here alluded to came suddenly upon Sir Joshua while he was painting.And ting'd all nature with the gloom of night!

And as they view this marble stone, Their little Mistress they bemoan. ON JAMES ROBSON, WHO DIED IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR OF HIS AGE, BY A FALL FROM HIS HORSE. To mark the hapless Youth's disastrous doom, The sorrow-wedded Father rears the tomb, On which a Mother wishes to express The mingled pride that swells with her distress: For he was all Affection could desire, All Duty ask'd, all Friendship could require: Simplicity was his, with strength of mind, With ev'ry milder influence combin'd; While Virtue, ardent to complete the whole, Diffus'd her magic colour o'er the soul! ON Miss HAMILTON. Endow'd with all that Fortune could bestow; With brilliancy of wit, and beauty's glow, Francisca, rising to her fifteenth year, Stood mid the virgin train without a peer: Her conscious bosom throbb'd to virtue warm, While diffidence still heighten'd ev'ry charm: But Heav'n's decree forbad this Beauty's Queen To act her part thro' beauty's short-liv'd scene: A gradual illness on her figure prey'd, And slowly, slowly sunk the fading Maid: Torn from each wish to which her youth aspir'd, Unfearing—uncomplaining—she expir'd: Thus some faint lily to its mother-ground In silence falls—while spring is blooming round.

They whom in life the bond of Friendship bound, Here in dread union press the funeral ground. THE RISE AND FALL OF THE NORTHERN POETRY: A POEM, IN TWO PARTS. TO THE Earl of ORFORD. ADVERTISEMENT. The materials that form the first Part of the following Poem are taken from the Scandinavian poetics, The EDDA! In the remarks on the third fable of the Edda, are these words, ‘A powerful Being had with his breath animated the drops out of which the first giant was formed. This Being, whom the Edda affects not to name, was entirely distinct from Odin, who had his birth long after the formation of the giant Ymir.’ — This first agent, or Genius, whom the Edda affects not to name, is supposed, in the following Poem, to create, from his own immediate power, the system of the Scaldic mythology. As it would have been impossible to introduce the whole system without running into a tedious enumeration, the principal feature of it are only retained, sufficient (it is presumed) to give some idea of the character of the northern poetry. Among other omissions, the reader will find that no mention is made of Gimlé, the mansion of bliss, that was appropriated to the reception of the virtuous, nor of Nastrande, the abode of the impious; these places not being supposed to exist in their full extent till the general destruction of the world; whereas the hall of Odin, and the caves of Hela, were peculiarly the Elysium and the Tartarus of the Runic poetry: they are perpetually referred to in the ancient songs of the Scalds, and the wild system of these contrasted abodes seems well calculated to encourage the spirit of war and enterprize which runs through the whole Scandinavian minstrelsy. Some expressions taken from the Edda may appear obscure without an explanation. — In the language of the Scalds, the world is stiled the great vessel that floats on the ages. — The rainbow, the bridge of the gods. — To drink the blood of friendship, alludes to a ceremony performed by two warriors when they enter into an alliance of friendship; they made incisions in their arms or breast, and tasting each other's blood, they mutually swore, that the death of the first of them who fell in battle should not pass unrevenged. To celebrate the mass of weapons, was to fight against the Christians, whose religious sentiments the Scandavians held in contempt, as thinking them adverse to the spirit of war. The Valkeries are a female troop, whom Odin sends to the field of battle upon invisible steeds; their function is to choose such as are destined to slaughter, and conduct their spirits to the Paradise of the Brave. Fenris is a large wolf, who is to break his chains at the general conflagration, and to swallow the sun. PART I. When urg'd by Destiny th' eventful year Sail'd thro' the portal of the northern sphere, Of Scandinavia the rude Genius rose, His breast deep-lab'ring with creation's throes: Thrice o'er his head a pow'rful wand he whirl'd, Then call'd to life a new Poetic world. First thro' the yawning waves that roar'd around, Uprising slow from out the gulph profound, Amidst the fury of the beating storm The giant Ymir heav'd his horrid form. Now on the stormy cloud the rainbow glows, Where gay Diversity her colouring throws. Beyond the sun the Pow'r now cast his eyes, And bade the splendid city Asgard rise; Obedient to the loud creative call She rises, circled with a crystal wall, Her sapphire mansions crown'd with opal tow'rs, O'er which the Pow'r a flood of radiance show'rs. Now a more daring task the Genius plann'd, He seiz'd the rapid lightning in his hand, And as around the broken rays he flung, From the fall'n spires the gods of Asgard sprung. See the dread Ash exalt its lofty head, And o'er a wide extent its umbrage shed: There twelve of Asgard's gods in close divan Sit in strict judgment on the deeds of man: Amidst the waving boughs enthron'd on high An eagle sends around his watchful eye. Three virgin forms, in snowy vests array'd, Stand in the deep recesses of the shade, The rich endowments of whose radiant mind Are by the Pow'r to different acts consign'd. He gives to thee, sage Urda, to restore The splendid deeds of times that are no more, And (faithful as the echo to the sound) Repeat transactions that were once renown'd. Clear to thy view, Vernandi, are unfurl'd The various scenes that fill the extensive world. To thee, O Skulda, the dread pow'r is giv'n, To read the counsels in the breast of heav'n; With daring forecast pierce th' abyss of time, And (utt'ring first some strange mysterious rhyme) Proclaim which babe, when rear'd to warlike form, Shall o'er his country roll destruction's storm; And which, directed to a better fate, Shall rise the pride and pillar of the state. Next, at the awful Pow'r's commanding call, Arose to view great Odin's festive hall! Engrav'd with sun-beams on the crystal gate Appear'd— —Here they reside in splendid state, Who, as they slept in death, reclin'd their head On valour's bier, the battle's rugged bed, Who to the bliss th' intrepid claim aspir'd, Who welcom'd pain, and with a smile expir'd. Now as the Genius waves his hallow'd hand The Valkeries appear, a female band, Prompt to the storm of lances to repair, On viewless steeds to scour the fields of air, Mark as they hover o'er the crowded plain The chosen chiefs, the death-devoted train. The Pow'r now form'd the coward's dwelling-place, The seat of pain, and mansion of disgrace: Deep under earth he fix'd the drear abode, Thro' which the rueful stream of anguish flow'd; Loud roar the surges thro' the gulph profound, While cavern'd echoes murmur back the sound. Close at the gate sat Death's terrific Maid, Her meagre form in sable weeds array'd; A wreath of living snakes entwine her head, And thus with shrilling voice the spectre said: ‘Haste to my caves, ye impotent of heart, ‘Who meanly shrink from valour's daring part, ‘Ye too, who ling'ring on with feeble breath, ‘Crept thro' the languor of old age to death.’ See on the horrid battle's bleeding plain The raven-brood rejoicing o'er the slain! Yet then in vain they gorge the grateful food, Death smites them at the dire repast of blood; When lo! their pinions to the wond'ring view Combining, into one vast texture grew; The gory heads conjoin'd in one dread fold, Around the frame a grisly margin roll'd: Now self-upborne the sable banner flings Bold to the wind its wide-expanding wings; ‘Exalt,’ the Genius cries, ‘thy plumes on high, ‘Wave thy dark signal to the warrior's eye; ‘Th' intrepid Youth beneath thy magic shade ‘Thro' slaughter'd heaps to victory shall wade Tho' the Raven-banner is not mentioned in the Edda, it is of great antiquity; it was supposed to be endued with some magical power, and to insure success..’ Now from a rock on which the Genius stood, He mark'd below a slowly-waving wood, Then rais'd his awful voice—‘Hail, hallow'd gloom, ‘(Where Thought is rear'd, and Fancy decks her plume) ‘Who hold'st within thy vast sequester'd bow'r ‘A numerous train, that wait the rip'ning hour: ‘Resign thy charge, yield to demanding time, ‘The living fathers of the Runic rhyme.’ Swift at his word the ancient sire survey'd, Tumultuous rushing from the solemn shade, Arm'd with the pow'rful harp, an ardent throng, The mighty founders of the northern song. 'Twas then the Pow'r resum'd—‘Ye chosen band, ‘At Nature's furnace take your faithful stand: ‘There forge the verse amidst the fiercest glow, ‘And thence the thunderbolts of Genius throw; ‘Rouse, rouse the tyrant from his flatt'ring dream, ‘Full at his vices wield the daring theme, ‘Till o'er his cheek shall flash intruding shame, ‘That blushing dawn of Virtue's rising flame. ‘Now on the bosom of the list'ning Youth ‘Impress, engrave the sacred form of Truth; ‘Bid them, as varying life unfolds to view, ‘Be still thro' all her scenes to honor true; ‘True to the man on Friendship's list enroll'd, ‘Th' entrusted secret of his soul untold. ‘Woe to that Chief, and blasted be his fame, ‘Whose mean soul chills Affection's holy flame; ‘Forgetting that he once, with zeal impress'd, ‘Drank the pure drops that flow'd from Friendship's breast. ‘Now to the realm, ye hallow'd Bards, impart ‘This truth, and touch with joy the human heart, ‘In man's too transient perishable frame ‘A glowing unabating fire proclaim, ‘Which, as that frame lies mould'ring into clay, ‘Shall thro' th' encircling ruin burst its way: ‘Thus when a torrent of impetuous rain ‘Drowns the low nest that trusted to the plain; ‘High soars the bird beyond Destruction's flow, ‘And owns no kindred with the wreck below. ‘Then o'er some stately tomb's dim entrance bend, ‘And from the daring harp unerring send ‘(As from the sounding bow with vigour sped) ‘The darts of harmony that wake the dead. ‘—Be too of prophecy the dreadful lords, ‘And strike the solemn, deep, mysterious chords; ‘Skill'd to reveal futurity's dark laws, ‘Inforce the song with many an awful pause. ‘In sounds that terrify the soul disclose ‘(Veil'd in the womb of time) destructive woes: ‘Say whirlwinds shall provoke the roaring main; ‘Say stars shall drop like glitt'ring gems of rain: ‘Say Fenris, bursting from his time-worn chains, ‘Shall bear wild horror thro' the Runic plains; ‘Doom'd while the course of havoc he shall run, ‘With jaws outstretch'd to rend the falling sun. ‘Say the gigantic ship, the floating world, ‘Shall, on the iron rock of ruin hurl'd, ‘Sink—like a dream that, rushing from the mind, ‘Leaves not a glimm'ring of its pomp behind ‘Ye bold Enthusiasts, join the warlike train, ‘When true to fame they seek the hostile plain; ‘Bid the loud harp delight the valiant throng, ‘And add the forceful eloquence of song. ‘Thinn'd of his numbers, mark the struggling Chief ‘Encircled close, and sever'd from relief: ‘Now strike the cheering harp—'tis heard no more, ‘Lost in the conflict's wild encreasing roar. ‘Yet strike again, yet strike the note profound, ‘I to the Chief will wast th' inspiring sound; ‘Till thro' the pressure of the battle's storm, ‘He o'er the slain a rugged path shall form. ‘Thus on the main when frozen fragments sail, ‘And with huge mounds oppose the giant whale; ‘The ocean's lord, enrag'd at the delay, ‘Thro' stubborn crashing ice-rocks bursts his way. ‘Now round some death-struck Chief in silence throng, ‘While thus he breathes his own historic song:— Tho' gash'd with wounds, unwounded is my fame, In the war's field I chas'd the flying game; Wrapt in the jealous veil of ling'ring night, Did we not chide the time's reluctant flight? Did not our voices hail the morning ray, Shouting the matins of th' important day? When foreign streamers glitter'd to our view, How swift our weapons from the scabbards flew! 'Twas joy to see the riven helmets fly, 'Twas joy to swell confusion's thund'ring cry, 'Twas joy to see (extending all around) The hostile banners spread the lowly ground; Methought the Danish field, thus mantled o'er, Heav'd conscious of the gorgeous robe it wore. ‘Thus as the Chief shall mitigate his pain See the notes the Reverend Mr. Johnstone has added to his translation of the Death-song of Loderoc., ‘With choral voice relieve the pausing strain: ‘Now, now again your soothing tones suspend, ‘And o'er the dying Chief attentive bend. Rush'd we not forth, at valour's daring call, To crush the forces of the Christian Gaul? Rush'd we not forth in terrible attire, To celebrate the mass of war a length'ning quire? Our glitt'ring swords, impatient of the fight, Were the dread relics that adorn'd the rite. But agony returns—my fading breath Denies expression to the song of death. Farewell—ye battle-sisters hover nigh, Receive your prize—and waft my soul on high! ‘Now ere he sinks beneath the blow of fate, ‘Reveal the honors of his future state; ‘Where to his wond'ring vision shall expand, ‘Adorn'd with heroes, a refulgent land. ‘Ye glowing masters of the Scaldic song In the first rude ages rocks and trees supplied the materials for writing, and on them were inscribed the rudiments of that art: the trees thus marked were held in veneration, and were even believed to inclose some supernatural agent., ‘Still other pow'rful gifts to you belong: ‘The lofty pine that meets the mountain gale, ‘Th' expanding oak that crowns the lowly vale, ‘Shall as your fingers touch the furrow'd rind, ‘Display the treasures of the musing mind: ‘There by the voice of whisp'ring Nature call'd, ‘In future times shall stand the youthful Scald, ‘There shall he meditate the Runic store, ‘There woo the science of the tuneful lore; ‘There view the tree with speechless wonder fraught, ‘Whose womb mysterious bears the Poet's thought; ‘There (from the busy world's incessant din) ‘Inhale the breathings of the Pow'r within. ‘Enough—the pow'r I now bestow enjoy, ‘In Virtue's cause the forceful harp employ: ‘Go forth, ye glorious conquerors of the mind, ‘Atchieve the hallow'd task to you assign'd: ‘Applaud the valiant, and the base controul, ‘Disturb, exalt, enchant the human soul.’ Thus to his Minstrels spoke the awful Pow'r— The warm Enthusiasts own th' inspiring hour; And now dividing into many a band, Strew their wild poetry o'er all the land: So while descending with resistless tide, The snow-flood hurries down the mountain's side, The sun, bright sailing 'midst his ardent beams, Melts the rude havoc into various streams; Which rushing thro' the naked vales below, Rouse vegetation as they roughly flow; Till a new scene o'erspreads the teeming earth, And smiling Nature hails the summer's birth. THE END OF THE FIRST PART. ADVERTISEMENT. The temple of UPSAL was destroyed by INGO, 1075 — a Christian cathedral was erected on its ruins fourscore year after. At the introduction of Christianity, the interposition of angels and appearance of ghosts grew familiar to the SCANDINAVIAN poetry, which was afterwards enriched by allegories, and by the accession of new images, which flowed to it through various channels, particularly from the East. — See RICHARDSON'S Dissertation. When colleges were founded, and the general attention was directed to classical learning, the wild conceptions of the Scaldic minstrels gradually fell into disuse. — This short Analysis contains the subject of the following pages. PART II. The gaudy dome to Pagan worship known, By Ingo's zealous hand at length o'erthrown; O'er the long-reaching ruins still rever'd, The Gothic pile its form majestic rear'd. The fretted columns of ambitious height, And bulk enormous, fix th' astonish'd sight; And as they boldly rise on either hand, Like kindred giants in dread phalanx stand: While thro' the isles that stretch a length'ning way, The umber'd windows shed terrific day. Amidst the wonders of the new abode, The bursting organ seem'd itself a god! Diffusing its magnificence of sound, And sending to the soul its note profound. Th' admiring numbers next the altar view'd, Crown'd with the image of the holy Rood, Displaying the sublime awards of Heav'n, A bleeding Deity—a world forgiv'n.— The awe-struck Bards stood bound as with a spell, While from their grasp the chill'd harp lifeless fell: The lowly valley, and the hill sublime, Echoed no more the battle-breathing rhyme. Thus an eclipse by terror's hand imbrown'd, Wrapt in concealment the poetic ground; But time at length the hov'ring veil withdrew, When all the gorgeous scenery burst to view. The Genius joy'd to see his ancient store Enrich'd with many a form unknown before. The clouds recede, while op'ning skies display Th' angelic hierarchy in proud array: Rank rising above rank in order due, The splendid consistory meets his view. Now spirits of another form appear, And from the yawning graves their shadows rear! Here glides a ghastly shade, intent to shed A scene of terror round the murd'rer's bed: There, 'midst the solemn silence of the night, Beneath the half-veil'd moon's reluctant light, The shade of buried Denmark stalks along, Fraught with his woes, indignant of his wrong. See, from yon infant's tomb, ascend to sight A little form attir'd in purest white: She meets the mother bending o'er the tomb, And wailing her lov'd girl's untimely doom. ‘Hail to thy grief!’ the gentle vision cries, ‘Hail to those tears that trickle from thine eyes: ‘Too feeling parent, mitigate thy pain, ‘Nor waste thy life beneath this gloomy fane: ‘Ah know, thy child with angels soars on high, ‘In the bright mansions of the upper sky, ‘And deck'd with wings that glitter to the ray, ‘Plays on the sun-beams of eternal day: ‘Pass a few years, to Heav'n's dread will resign'd, ‘And thou shalt leave all sorrow far behind; ‘The bliss I now enjoy thou shalt obtain, ‘And e'en Maria shall be thine again.’ At length, o'erspreading the poetic land, Advanc'd the various allegoric band: First on a flow'r-clad hill sublimely high, Whose brow aspiring rush'd into the sky, Hope with a cheering aspect took her stand, A radiant pencil glitt'ring in her hand, With this she colours the dark clouds that low'r, And threaten man with rude misfortune's show'r. Then Celibacy came, in cloisters bred, A sluggish, shard-born form, with dust o'erspread: Dead to the bliss that social life bestows, Dead to the bliss that from affection flows, Dead to the blandishments of female pow'r, He schools the priesthood in his iron bow'r. Then Grace—the Hebe of the Christian sky, With smiling lip and comfort-beaming eye! Th' angelic numbers from their thrones above Stoop'd to behold this object of their love: Thus the full host of stars in cloudless night Gaze on the earth from their ethereal height. His meagre form now Disappointment rears, His cheek deep-channel'd with incessant tears, Trailing, as still he treads the thorny plain, Of blasted hopes the long immeasurable chain. Now Conscience enter'd on the trembling scene, And to the bad disclos'd her with'ring mien: But chiefly when the death-watch strikes the ear, This dread recorder of the past draws near: Ere sick'ning Gertrude fell to death a prey Queen of Denmark, and mother to Hamlet., (Tradition still repeats the moral lay) To goad the bosom of that impious dame, To the pale suff'rer's couch prompt Conscience came, Like a dire necromancer skill'd to raise Th' accusing ghosts of her departed days! Her lab'ring heart sent forth distraction's sigh, As on the Priest she cast th' imploring eye: Then to the Cross (while tears her bosom lave) The kiss of terror, not of love, she gave: Now, yielding to th' access of wild despair, She shrieks, and rends with savage grasp her hair: Now to reflection's gentler pow'r consign'd, Long plaintive tones denote her troubled mind: At length, sad spectacle of wrath divine! The high-born wretch expires without a sign See Henry the VIth. the death of Cardinal Beauford.. On the dire battle's late-ensanguin'd plain, Morality stood musing o'er the slain! Yet then the mourner rais'd her drooping head, And thus with sacred energy she said: ‘Here—where the fatal scenes of slaughter end, ‘Where hostile nations in dread union blend, ‘Where sleep the great, the daring, and the proud, ‘Amidst this silent solitary crowd, ‘Bid the young monarch quench ambition's flame, ‘And 'gainst his passions daring war proclaim.’ Thus came th' instructive allegoric train, To swell the triumph of the Scaldic reign: The Genius now beheld a ghastly crowd, Borne thro' the mid air on the evening cloud: The sable pageantry (when near) display'd Th' unhallow'd form of many a horrid shade. Envelop'd in a robe of darkest hue, The half-existing phantom burst to view; From out the robe a death's-head seem'd to rise, Thro' which tremendous glar'd two fulgent eyes. The whistler shrill, that whoso hears doth dy. Spenser, Canto 12. B. 2d. The time has been my senses would have cool'd to hear a night-shriek. Macbeth, Act v. Scene 5.He too of dreadful fame, th' alarming spright, The unnam'd lonely wand'rer of the night, Whose shriek, profaning the repose around, Foreboded death to him who heard the sound. With wings outstretch'd the Gryphon next was seen, Half-eagle, lion-half, a form obscene: To these th' innumerable host adjoin'd Of shapes uncouth, the tyrants of the mind, Matchless in force, and splenetic of mood, The family of death, and terror's brood. The moon now launching on th' expanse of night, Exulting sail'd amidst a flood of light; Along whose beams (diminutive of size) A ship aerial glided thro' the skies: Which as it rode resplendent from afar, Assum'd th' appearance of a shooting star! The playful Gossimer supplied the sail, Swell'd by the pressure of the panting gale: The deck was peopled by a sprightly band, The little progeny from fairy land! The scene now chang'd—the mountain heav'd groan, The bending forest breath'd a sullen moan: When lo three Lapland hags, self-pois'd on high, Of hideous aspect, struck the wond'ring eye! Their implements of art aloft they bear, And (like the low'ring cloud that loads the air) They spread the texture of the fatal loom, While grim night blackens to a deeper gloom. These forms were welcom'd, as they pass'd along, By savage howlings of the wolf-dog throng. Disastrous ravens to this groupe repair, And bats, the fiends that haunt the darken'd air; And owls the groupe pursue with heavy flight, Prophets of woe, and harpies of the night; And they who 'midst the storm exulting soar, And they whose talons reek with infants' gore. See from their height the haggard shapes descend, And to the ocean's shore their footsteps bend; Where cavern'd deep in conclave dim they dwell, There utter the dread curse, there breathe the spell! Hostile to man, their machinations frame, And act the unhallow'd deed without a name. Thus have we sketch'd, with faint imperfect hand, The forms that peopled the poetic land, Aerial forms (by glowing fiction dress'd) Who rais'd to joy, or aw'd the human breast. At length, these visions fading on the sight, The university of Copenhagen was founded by Christien, who died 1481. —Mallet's History of Denmark, vol. vi. p. 443.A new creation rose at once to light; As from a gulph the new creation sprung, On which the classic beams their splendor flung; While on the land which late we wander'd o'er, Where wild invention watch'd her growing store, Where (thro' rich vales) with swelling surges bold, The flood of poetry resistless roll'd! O'er which the glist'ning rays of fancy play'd, And near whose banks the human passions stray'd, On this rude scene of wonder and delight, In evil moment rush'd eternal night. ABELARD TO ELOISA: A POEM. ADVERTISEMENT. The Monastery of CLUNI, from thence ABELARD is supposed to write the following Epistle, was founded in the year 611, near the village of Mascon, on the river Graone. The Head of this convent (in the time of ABELARD) was distinguished for his learning and humanity. History elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks, by the appellation of the Venerable PETER! He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD, when he was under the censure of the court of Rome. SAINT BERNARD also is connected with the story of Paraciete. This great man stands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century: Born with a mind too restless and enterprising to be confined within the circle of monastic occupations, he rushed into the tumult of active life, and took the lead of some of the most important transactions of the period. With an undisciplined ardour peculiar to his character, he precipitated his country into that ruinous measure, the second crusade. Behold him at another time hastening to the contest that held all EUROPE in suspence, which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom. The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpowered the pretensions of ANACLETUS, and INNOCENT was seated on the papal throne. The enemies of this celebrated Abbot never impeached his moral character; but it must be allowed that in his zeal against the innovation of new opinions, he has sometimes left unregarded the superior duty of charity. A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO, the pope's legate in France, contains the most intolerant and sanguinary counsel. ABELARD in the following Epistle lays a considerable stress upon his sentence of excommunication: In the dark ages, that spiritual humiliation was felt as the greatest calamity; the relation, the parent, the lover, the friend, suspended their endearing offices, and withdrew from the degraded offender. THE following poem has been distinguished by a beautiful sonnet, inserted in a volume of Poems that does honour to modern poetry, by Mr. Taylor, a gentleman whose commendation is a passport to Fame, except where it is directed (as in the present instance) by the amiable bias of friendship. Yon midnight bell, that frights the peaceful air! Commands the Fathers to their wonted pray'r: Now in long order flows the sable throng, Like a dark, sullen stream that creeps along: Why joins not Abelard the sainted train? Does torpid sloth his ling'ring steps detain? These walls, that pillow steep'd in tears, attest That sleep is exil'd from this tortur'd breast: This lamp proclaims the same, whose trembling beam Guides while my hand pursues the glowing theme: While the dread secret from my soul I tear, And unreserv'd my bosom'd feelings bare. Ah me! the passion that my soul misled Was check'd, not conquer'd; buried, but not dead: Now bursting from the grave, in evil hour, It hastens to its prey with fiercer pow'r, And, vulture-like, with appetite increas'd It riots on the undiminish'd feast. Daughter of Paraclete dost thou complain In iron silence that I lock'd my pain? That not to thee (soft solacer in woe) I bad the troubled waves of Anguish flow? Methought the course of three long years' retreat Would scarce thy length'ning sacrifice complete: Methought I should profane the hallow'd rite, Did my laments thy pitying ear affright: Thus at the altar, wrapt in holy dread, The youth of Macedon in silence bled, Nor from his tortur'd and consuming hand Dismiss'd the living close-adhering brand Alluding to the boy at Athens, who, while he was assisting at a religious ceremony, endured a burning coal that fell on his hand, rather than disturb the sacrifice.. But now thy slow inauguration's o'er, And thou hast reach'd Religion's tranquil shore, Now that stern habit throws without controul Her chain of adamant around thy soul, May not th' unhappy Abelard disclose (To her who pities most) his train of woes? Ye sullen gates, within whose bound confin'd, The wretch who enters flings his joys behind! Emerging from the dome, ye crowding spires, Which sun robed glitter like ascending fires! That funeral spot with many a cypress spread, Where shriek the spirits of the guilty dead! Yon moping forest, whose extensive sway Admits no lucid interval of day, No cheering vista with a trail of light Flies thro' the heavy gloom of lasting night! Ye hermitages, deep immers'd in wood, Wash'd by the passing tributary flood, Whose easy waves, soft-murm'ring as they roll, Lull the strong goadings of the feeling soul! Ye tow'ring rocks, to wonder's eye address'd, Mishapen piles by Terror's hand impress'd!— Ah, not these scenes magnificently rude To Virtue's lore have Abelard subdued. When late my steps drew near the peopled choir, What erring wishes did my heart inspire? To the deep mysteries as I advanced, Still in thy presence was my soul entranced: While, bending to the earth, the choral throng Pause, ere they usher the emphatic song; While kneeling seraphs, trembling as they glow, Veil with their radiant wings their bashful brow; While the deep organ (as by fear controul'd) Its solemn sound like distant thunder roll'd; While thick'ning odours dimm'd the dread abode, And th' altar shudder'd at th' approaching God!— 'Midst these august, terrific rites unmov'd, My guilty thoughts to other altars rov'd: In Love enchas'd, a dearer image blest That living chapel, my impassion'd breast! Where burns a hungry and insatiate flame To that soft deity I blush to name. Those hours to recollection spring renew'd, When Passion urg'd us, and when Pleasure woo'd; When, captur'd by Desire's voluptuous hold, Involv'd—combin'd—embodied—and insoul'd— Forbear....Let dim Oblivion cast behind, Words that would soil thy purity of mind: Recal, recal that interesting hour, When in the flush of Youth, and Beauty's flow'r, (Ah! doom'd, severely doom'd, to meet no more) When from each dearer self our forms we tore, How, to Affection's finer touch consign'd, My face upon thy summer cheek inclin'd, Felt as it dropt thy tear's celestial dew, While sighs, not words, breath'd forth our last adieu. Intruding Fancy rais'd the veil between, And shew'd Futurity's unwelcome scene, Nights of long absence that expect no dawn, Divorcing gulphs that must for ever yawn. In thy pure soul a purer self I trac'd, Our glowing minds with energy embrac'd, Whence th' intellectual progeny arose Which kindred fears and kindred hopes compose, Endearments tending to one mutual aim, The same our sorrow, and our joy the same. Now that thy spirit is divinely wrought, To nobler objects flies thy soaring thought; For free and unrestrain'd of human ties, Thy soul uncaptiv'd springs into the skies! To Contemplation's height sublime you sail, While wings seraphic aid the hallow'd gale; From man to God! Perfection's dazzling source, Unwearied you pursue your bright'ning course, And as thro' station'd angels you advance, Send on the throne of Heav'n a daring glance. For me, unequal to this dizzy height, Undisciplin'd, unwing'd for mystic flight, To speed the ling'ring step of cloyster hours, To science I consign'd my mental pow'rs: Fame met me in her path, and round my brow Engarlanded the flow'rs of brightest glow. Then swell'd, disturb'd with Envy's with'ring pow'r, The serpent Bernard hiss'd within my bow'r, Pour'd the black venom with insidious aim, Chill'd my soul's health, and dimm'd my radiant name: Still, still inventing some malignant plan; Impetuous, turbulent, vindictive man! Behind the simple, meek, monastic vest, Ambition blazes in his troubled breast. Averse amid the pensive shades to dwell, He shuns the stillness of the lonely cell, Embroils the contests that involve the great, Deepens the storm that darkens o'er the state, And like the bird of Jove, by vengeance driv'n, Bears in his grasp th' artillery of Heav'n! See Anaclétus, trembling at his frown, To Innocent resign the doubtful crown: Mark, at the impulse of his bold command, The throng that hastens to the palmy land: See to his gaudy levee crouds resort; See the gay tinsel'd foplings of the court: There too the hoary sages of the law, And military chiefs approach with awe; There abbots, princes, cardinals, advance, And all the splendor, all the pride of France. As not unworthy of his sainted rage, Now meaner objects tread his busy stage; He bids thy Abelard ascend the scene, And pours the torrent of his holy spleen: Then Persecution, with resistless sway, Thro' her long-sounding flood-gates burst away; Her armory the Vatican display'd, In all its proud magnificence array'd; From whence abrupt th' avenging Pontiff sprung, And at my peace the bolt of terror flung: While o'er her victim (to dishonour led) Her cloud of iron extirpation spread. Now the pale outcast both of Heav'n and earth, I curs'd the day that glimmer'd on my birth: Degraded—shunn'd—to infamy allied, Amidst the ruins of my soul I cried, No more my image to her thought adjoin'd Shall share the heav'n of Eloisa's mind: No more (I cried) my reprobated name Shall from her lips its daily honour claim, No longer to the throne of God repair, Borne on the wings of her triumphant pray'r. Now frenzy urg'd my wild'ring steps to rove Beneath the night of yon extensive grove: Now urg'd along the mountain's top to range (Despair still haunting me thro' ev'ry change) To tread th' advent'rous path that winds the brow Which scowls tremendous o'er the vale below: Then to the summit of yon rock I toil'd, That shoots its crags fantastically wild! There rush'd upon my view the hallow'd cross, Cloath'd in the garb of venerable moss! This wonted pledge of mercy and delight Struck on my fading hope a dark'ning blight: No more the saving all-atoning rood, The grisly symbol of revenge it stood! Lost in the extacy of strong despair, With madd'ning hand I tore my rooted hair.— 'Twas then the seer of warm compassion came To lull my tortures and dispel my shame: “Desist,” the Priest of Charity began, “And own once more the dignity of man! “No longer Rome and Abelard are foes, “The thunders of the Vatican repose; “The holy church, by my remonstrance won, “Grasps to her bosom her still darling son.” Hail to the tidings of that cheering voice That bids the humbled Abelard rejoice! That bids his image, to her thought rejoin'd, Still share the heav'n of Eloisa's mind. No more thy person (that attractive sight) Diffusing round ineffable delight, Nor thy discourse, illum'd with Wisdom's ray, Which with soft rapine steals the soul away: That eye, where meek Dominion holds her throne; That voice, where Music smooths her softest tone; By liberal Nature prodigally giv'n, (What words can't paint) that smile of opening Heav'n: These various charms, that pass all human praise, These charms that once adorn'd my happier days, No more shall I behold—'tis folly to complain, Those days of splendor ne'er must rise again. Adieu, thou mistress of enchanting pow'r! Thou blissful vision of a transient hour! For such appears (to Fancy still how dear!) The sloping race of Rapture's swift career, When Heav'n enforcing its benign decree, With lavish bounty gave thy form to me. Hope now is dead, and Pleasure's knell is rung; With sable thoughts my dreary mind is hung. 'Twas at the hour when from the sorrowing view The glowing God of day his beams withdrew, When Vesper all her pageantry display'd, Fretting the sky with many an awful shade: Here trees appear'd that struggled with the storm, There a wan cloud assum'd a spectre's form: A solitary hand here grasp'd a spear, There angry meteors combated in air: Now riding on the wind with threat'ning mien, The dark, terrific phantom Death was seen: From a thick vapour's dread unfolding womb Now bodied forth the likeness of a tomb: Thy form, Oh Eloise! I clearly traced, Thine airy arms the sepulchre embraced: That mimic tomb my early fate foreshews, While my soul labours with prophetic throes: Now closes fast my short disastrous day, To life's dark boundary I haste away. The virtuous Cluni still relieves my pains, To thee will he convey my cold remains: This kind assurance mitigates my doom, Thou'lt stand the guardian angel at my tomb: Clos'd be this form in Eloisa's fane, She'll sigh my requiem with a Lover's strain: Oft to my grave with sorrowful delight Will she repair, as glooms the thick'ning night: Burst from thy cloud, Oh Cynthia! burst away, The holy shadow of her frame display! Let the soft texture of her length'ning shade Repose along the spot where mine is laid! Were thus her presence to my wishes giv'n, Death would rejoice, my grave would then be Heav'n! Forgive this last effusion of a heart Which Love and Nature form'd, unstain'd by Art; Which midst the fears that wait on Death's decree, With all its wonted ardor darts to thee. Prepare, prepare for that relentless day When the dark hearse this form shall bear away! When, to the fane of Paraclete convey'd, My humble bier shall at thy feet be laid: Prepare, prepare—throw back the vestal gate, Receive the victim of untimely fate: Receive the man misfortune held to view, Still mid his woes invariably true: The warm enthusiast (now from passion free) Whose life was one continued hymn to thee. Prepare, prepare—yet check the bursting moan, Thou to compassion exquisitely prone! Lest glowing sympathy, with Death at strife, Should kindle my cold ashes into life, And my rous'd voice, invading Nature's laws, Breathe in loud accents terrible applause. THE AFRICAN BOY. Ah, tell me, little mournful Moor, Why still you linger on the shore? Haste to your play-mates, haste away, Nor loiter here with fond delay: When Morn unveil'd her radiant eye, You hail'd me as I wander'd by; Returning at th' approach of Eve, Your meek salute I still receive. “Benign Enquirer, thou shalt know Why here my lonesome moments flow: 'Tis said thy Countrymen (no more Like rav'ning sharks that haunt the shore) Return to bless, to raise, to cheer, And pay Compassion's long arrear. “Tis said the num'rous Captive Train, Late bound by the degrading Chain, Triumphant come, with swelling sails, 'Mid smiling skies, and western gales; They come with festive heart and glee, Their hands unshackled—minds as free; They come, at Mercy's great command, To re-possess their native land. “The gales that o'er the Ocean stray, And chase the waves in gentle play, Methinks they whisper as they fly, Juellen soon will meet thine eye! 'Tis this that sooths her little Son, Blends all his wishes into one: Ah! were I clasp'd in her embrace, I wou'd forgive her past disgrace: Forgive the memorable hour She fell a prey to tyrant pow'r; Forgive her lost, distracted air, Her sorrowing voice, her kneeling pray'r; The suppliant tears that gall'd her cheek, And last, her agonizing shriek. Lock'd in her hair, a ruthless hand Trail'd her along the flinty strand; A ruffian train, with clamours rude, The impious spectacle pursu'd: Still as she mov'd, in accents wild, She cried aloud, My child! my child! The lofty bark she now ascends; With screams of woe, the air she rends: The vessel less'ning from the shore, Her piteous wails I heard no more; Now as I stretch'd my last survey, Her distant form dissolv'd away. “That day is past: I cease to mourn— Succeeding joy shall have its turn; Beside the hoarse-resounding deep A pleasing anxious watch I keep: For when the morning clouds shall break, And darts of day the darkness streak, Perchance along the glitt'ring main, (Oh, may this hope not throb in vain!) To meet these long desiring eyes, Juellen and the Sun may rise.” ENTHUSIASM: A POEM, IN TWO PARTS. ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION. In endeavouring to display the good and bad effects occasioned by Enthusiasm, I might have drawn many signal instances from that inexhaustible mine, the Greek and Roman story; but it appeared to me more eligible to work upon materials hewn from the modern quarry only: the subject, thus treated, I conceived would come more home to the feelings of the reader. With regard to the execution, that rests entirely on the judgement of the Public, into whose presence I now enter, impressed with a mingled sensation of hope and apprehension. PART I. Beyond th' exalted sun's meridian site, Beyond the glimm'ring stars ethereal height, A brighter realm immortal spring displays, Mid the soft breathing of unclouded days: Where sacred minds to virtue high allied, Aerial beings, orient forms abide, Seraphic people! ministers of grace, Prompt to defend and cheer the human race: The mighty mother Earth, who bears mankind, Is to their care and guardian pow'r consign'd. When clashing waves swell high, and angry Fate Tosses the lab'ring vessel of the state, The chosen Angel of th' appointed realm Hastes from his throne, and grasps the trembling helm: To some the honor'd privilege is giv'n To waft the clay-divested soul to heav'n, Weed from the feeling heart the rising sigh, And sweep with viewless hand the clouded eye: Each in his turn descending from above, Performs the generous ministry of love. Behold, superior to the sun-rob'd quire, A female Form to regal pow'r aspire! High on a throne, in brighter beams array'd, Reigns in full pomp th' Enthusiastic Maid! Daughter of Energy, who boldly leads The hallow'd few to great and splendid deeds: Who urges man the steep ascent to climb, And lifts the soul to virtue's height sublime. Thus when of late to fam'd Iberia's coast Gibraltar. Sail'd o'er the wond'ring main th' unnumber'd host, Swift from her seat th' impatient Goddess sprung, And o'er the spot with anxious bosom hung, Till shedding on her sons, to fame consign'd, Some emanation of her dauntless mind, She saw the valiant long-enduring band (Whose fall confederated nations plann'd) Atchieve that deed which time shall still revere, That British miracle to glory dear! Long had th' Enthusiast held her rank supreme, Belov'd, ador'd, of every voice the theme; At length the blast of satire dimm'd the rays, Whose soft effulgence play'd around her praise: The throne encircling frequent murmurs flew, And busy charges trimm'd in motley hue: Yet then, confiding in her god-like plan, Which warms, invigorates, and hallows man, She dares her foes, she dares the hostile train To shake the pillars of her stedfast reign: Urg'd by her innate energy to meet The gath'ring war, she quits her lofty seat, At Reason's bar presents her holy form, Provokes the thund'rers, and demands the storm. A living crescent the bright pow'rs display, Rank above rank in terrible array: While trembling silence breathes upon the train, And expectation throbs in ev'ry vein; Amid this scene th' accusing Angel rose, On his stern brow bold indignation glows; Some troubling vision, with disaster fraught, Employs, detains, alarms his wond'ring thought: —“What rising structure rushes on my sight, Of bulk enormous, of aspiring height The Alexandrian Library, consisting of four hundred thousand manuscripts, was burnt in the sixth century, by the order of Omar; whose enthusiastic zeal for his religion forced from him this memorable saying: “If the books contain only what is in the Coran “they are useless, and dangerous if they contain any thing else.”? Th' Enthusiast, hast'ning thro' the regal porch, Waves in the eye of day a raging torch: See (impious spectacle!) she fires the pile, And hails the sparkles with a greedy smile: Wide and more wide th' imparted flame extends, And now in dreadful victory ascends. Not sumptuous palaces, not awful fanes, Nor of old time the proud, august remains, Not airy villas, nor majestic tow'rs, High massive bulwarks, nor gay pleasure's bow'rs, But to th' unhallow'd blaze I see consign'd The splendid temple of the Poet's mind. Ah! lov'd Tyrtæus Tyrtæus reanimated the dejected minds of the Spartans with the irresistible power of his poetry, accompanied by the harp., tow'ring son of fame, Thy pages shrivel at th' insatiate flame: The glorious workings of thy pregnant heart, The sallies from the inmost breast that start, Eloquent threats that lawless pow'r controul, Thy bursts of rage, and vehemence of soul. Unrivall'd leader of th' ecstatic train, Farewell (for ever lost) thy forceful strain; Farewell (for ever lost) the Spartan song, Which rouz'd to conquest the dejected throng: Did not despondence, like a gath'ring show'r, Hang o'er thy countrymen in evil hour? Say, did she not her fenny pinions spread, And on each bosom chilling fear-drops shed? Thou like the sun a cheerful radiance threw, And from the soil the noxious vapour drew, Till the fall'n soul, uprising from her death, Inhales once more th' invigorating breath. Thy voice—'Tis Honor's call on Virtue's train: Thy voice—Yes, Sparta hears th' inspiring strain; To that vindictive with bold step she speeds, And reaps the harvest of immortal deeds! Unrivall'd leader of th' ecstatic quire, Peace to the manes of thy martial lyre, If peace can be while with licentious pow'r The hungry fires thy last remains devour: Methinks thy lucid, unsubstantial frame Now hovers o'er the wide destructive flame; I see thee toss thine airy arms on high, I hear at times thy shrill, despairing cry: So the fond mother-bird, alarm'd, distrest, Indignant flutters round her peopled nest, While (piteous sight!) a ruthless hand invades, And bears away the music of the shades. See to the dome (thro' many an age rever'd) Which for her sons the hand of Science rear'd, The fiery deluge rolls with threat'ning roar, And sweeps away the long-collected store: Alluring apologues address'd to youth, Pure maxims moulded in the breast of truth, Warm from the holy lips of sages breath'd, Rich moral legacies to man bequeath'd! Celestial thoughts, which (like the fav'ring gales Whose gentle pressure swells the gladsome sails) Waft the dejected mind, with toil o'erspent, To the gay-winding harbor of content. Now History with a heart-felt sigh surveys Her themes, her annals, midst the sounding blaze: Fame smiles no more, but with an alter'd mien Stands trembling at destruction's growing scene: At length, descending like a low-hung cloud, Oblivion o'er the waste expands her shroud, Beneath whose dark'ning canopy is cast The fond remembrance of transactions past: Of youthful warriors, who, by glory led, Bold in the clam'rous van of danger bled, Who, midst the storms of state and home-born wars, Gleam'd thro' the thick'ning shade like morning stars, Till flung untimely from their radiant height, Down, down they hurried to eternal night: Of patriots, who, to honor close allied, In times disastrous stood their country's pride! How these sublime state-columns, tempest-proof, Upheld, midst bursting clouds, the sacred roof, Firm to their cause, and obstinately great, No voice of mortal ever shall relate: Nor shall the voice of mortal e'er display, Or annals usher to the eye of day, The various orders of the female train Diffus'd like flow'rets o'er the smiling plain, Who, like those flow'rets in their beauty's glow, Were swept untimely by the scythe of woe. Here then, to keen reflection's crowded eye, As in a deep sepulchral mansion lie, In iron slumber wrapt, and dread repose, A train of human virtues, human woes: This moral loss the world must now sustain, Swells o'er the boundary of domestic pain, Calls down the gushes of the bleeding mind, And claims th' expansive sorrow of mankind.” He ceas'd.—A Seraph, to his cause allied, And firm to battle on th' accusing side, Resum'd the theme! his arm exalted high, A wild fire flashing from his pregnant eye— “What numerous fugitives arrest my view Alluding to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in consequence of which the Hugonots quitted the kingdom., Their cheek discolour'd with dejection's hue? What ruthless pow'r the wanton act decreed? What led the monarch to this desp'rate deed? Behold—th' Enthusiast at the regal chair Breathes her inflaming whispers on his ear: Now, now she urges his reluctant hand To ratify the terrible command: O hapless, lost, exterminated race, What can atone this unprovok'd disgrace? Ye venerable men with silver hair, Gall'd by the heavy yoke of thornful care, With dauntless soul, enshrin'd in feeble forms, Ye meet the thunders of the rushing storms, Prompt a bold war for virtue's sake to wage Against the comforts of reposing age: Friends, honors, kindred, country ye disclaim, The smiles of patronage, the wreaths of fame, Firm to endure the persecuting rod, And in th' abyss of grief to seek your God. Ye too, ye Fair, on virtue's list enroll'd, Whom Nature fashion'd in her softer mould, In pale adversity's rude science vers'd, Your feeling soul with sorrow's dart transpierc'd, I see you slowly move, a length'ning train, Far from the bounds of your domestic plain: Imagination renovates the hour Ye fell the victims of relentless pow'r, How still ye linger'd on your native strand, Enclos'd by Friendship's small but ardent band; How as ye wept, caressing and caress'd, Your babes were ravish'd from your throbbing breast. But now, intruding on my wond'ring sight, My strong abhorrence other scenes excite. Beneath the roof, where Death's chill banners spread, An agonizing Fair reclines her head: Around the mournful couch of languor stand (In hallow'd vestment) a monastic band! Yet not to act affection's sacred part, With lenient hand to draw the rankling dart, Thro' hope's gay perspective command to rise A soothing prospect of the opening skies; Ah! not for heav'nly charity's best end The gloomy fathers o'er the suff'rer bend, But from th' alarm'd reluctant mind to wrest The coy assentment to the hateful Test This relates to a penal law which confiscated the estates of those who did not, at their deaths, renounce the reformed religion. —See Saurin's Sermons, vol. i. page 152.. At this the mourner lifts her drooping head— ‘While here I languish on affliction's bed, Say, is it thus ye minister relief, And whisper comfort to the soul of grief? When harass'd nature, with herself at strife, The last gleam fading on the lamp of life, When to the storm succeeds the welcome calm, When angel hands reach out the victor's palm, Must I that bliss, that heav'nly prize forego, And whelm my spirit in immortal woe? Yet then my infants, by pale Famine led, Must ask from Pity's hand the scanty bread; Methinks I see them now expos'd to scorn, Their little bosoms pierc'd with sorrow's thorn: Oh, what an image to a mother's sight! The view transports me into madd'ning fright; I yield, I yield, unfold the fatal creed, And Mercy from his thought efface the deed!’ At these dread words, that clos'd th' eventful scene, Religion blush'd, and veil'd her awful mien: Yet on the crime, from tyrant edicts born, By nature from the dying mother torn, Wrung from the bosom, by distraction riv'n, Forgiveness dropt the holy tear of Heav'n. Now to my view, by terrors undismay'd, The glory of the priesthood stands display'd! The virtuous Pastor James Saurin, the celebrated preacher at the Hague, where he resided several years, and was at once the edification and comfort of his exiled brethren. of the suff'ring race, Proud of his wrongs, and patient of disgrace: Him the unhappy fugitives enclose, While thus he speaks—‘Ye partners of my woes, Oh strenuous found in persecution's day, Ye faithful, dear companions of my way, I now behold you as the snow-wing'd dove, Expell'd the ancient mansions of her love, Whose plumes, while clouds o'er canopy her flight, Assume the splendor of a purer white. Does not dim obloquy attaint our birth? Are not our temples levell'd with the earth? Are not our kindred, friends, in fetters bound, Plung'd in the terrors of the cavern'd ground? And we, meek victims, as we pass'd along, Endur'd we not the loud upbraiding throng, While the loose soldiery added to these woes With jeering insults and degrading blows? It seem'd as nature mark'd us for disgrace, The outcast offals of the human race. Oh thou Lewis XIV., by all these horrors unappall'd, Whom with delight I Royal Master call'd, Thou, to remembrance now no longer dear, Whom as the scourge of Heav'n I still revere, Farewell!—Thou too, by partial Fortune blest, All Nature's off'rings breathing at thy breast, Thrice happy France, farewell!—these eyes no more Shall view thy charms, that spread from shore to shore: Thy harvests waving with a stately pride, Thy vintage blushing on the mountain's side; Original and self-exuberant soil, Refusing nothing to the hand of toil; And where the Arts, a bright harmonious band, Refine, exalt, and decorate the land; Where Mirth, the native of thy social bow'rs, Sheds on each lip his fascinating pow'rs; With thee may bliss still undiminish'd dwell, Hail, Oh my country, and a last farewell!’ The Pastor ceas'd.—Then sorrow burst its bound, With fervent lips some kiss'd their parent-ground; Some, with the same tormenting thought imprest, Tore the wild grass and flow'rets from her breast, To bear a relic of their natal plain To scenes unknown, and realms beyond the main. So firm, so pow'rful on the heart of man (Above inconstancy's relenting plan) Is fix'd, enthron'd by Nature's hallow'd hand, The glowing passion of his native land. These are the evils (woe succeeding woe) Which from th' Enthusiast in long order flow: Yet not for these does terror daunt her soul, Mark that proud eye impatient of controul, See riding on that brow imperial will, And Tyranny, the minister of ill. Let then resentment fierce, terrific, loud, Burst like the thunder from the rifted cloud: The course of her devasting steps I've run; My journey's o'er, the mournful tale is done.” END OF THE FIRST PART. PART II. Now rose a Seraph, by affection led, A wreathing glory hovers o'er his head, His flowing accents spotless candour own'd, And on his brow sat Energy enthron'd: He speaks—“The vulture hast'ning to his prey, With sounding pinions wins his distant way, Regardless of the charms that Nature's hand In gay profusion scatters o'er the land, And, summon'd by the pestilential gale, Speeds to the carcase fest'ring in the vale: So these accusers in their rav'ning mood Appear to emulate the gory brood, Unmindful of the virtues that surround The spot on which their censures most abound. Now deeds long past like exhalations roll, Now nearer move, now open on the soul: I see the pale-ey'd citizens convene, In Hist'ry's drama, high-recorded scene Edward III. was so exasperated at the long and gallant resistance he met with from the citizens of Calais, that he threatened to put all the inhabitants to the sword: he desisted from this atrocious design, on the condition that six persons should be sent to him for the purpose of immediate execution. He required that they should approach his presence bare-footed, cloathed in mourning, with ropes round their necks.! The dread resolve from Edward's bosom sprung, Wild consternation o'er their counsels flung: With chilling, blood-recoiling thoughts imprest, Entrancing terror deadens ev'ry breast. At length from out the silent depth emerg'd An ardent Chief, by glory's impulse urg'd: Th' Enthusiast wraps him in her wak'ning fires, And thus he utters what her soul inspires: ‘Ye firm associates in the highest cause, On whom posterity will show'r applause, Who, while calamity severely reign'd, Well the long labours of the siege sustain'd! Deign to accept what my affections give, And bid your kindred, friends, and children live: This, this will cheer me in the trying hour, When I shall bend at the stern tyrant's pow'r, And the doom'd victim (as his rage decreed) On the pure altar of my country bleed: Ah! should my strong forebodings tell me true, Pass one swift moment, these glad eyes shall view The destin'd number of the victims rise, To swell the rites of patriot sacrifice!’— These words prophetic were not ardor's rant, Five kindred bosoms warm for glory pant, These youths th' Enthusiast, sev'ring from the rest, Informs, and breathes herself into their breast; And now, envelop'd in her active flame, The daring chiefs the pond'rous honor claim. See, thro' th' applauses of the grateful throng, The self-devoted heroes move along: To Eustace now advanc'd a beauteous Maid, In the rude garb of negligence array'd, Her auburn tresses ruffling to the wind, Her eye expressive of her tortur'd mind: Say, desp'rate Youth,’ the wild'ring Fair exclaim'd, ‘What dire conception has thy bosom fram'd? Oh, death-importing scenery! sight abhorr'd! Whence this attire, this ignominious cord? Impell'd by frenzy, whither dost thou tend? Relent, relent, thine impious steps suspend!’— With a calm fortitude the Chieftain said, ‘The path that climbs to honor's height I tread: These joyful loud acclaims that rend the air Wouldst thou convert to howlings of despair? Ev'n love commands—with eager step I go, To shield Clotilda from impending woe.’ ‘What peace,’ she answers, ‘can I thence derive? The lover murder'd, say can joy survive? While famine, sickness, terrors I endur'd, Was this the future bliss that hope assur'd? To length'ning care, to sorrow still allied, Behold Clotilda stands Misfortune's bride! Had Mercy, heav'n-descending Mercy, stole Her gentle radiance o'er the conqu'ror's soul, This day, escap'd from wide affliction's wreck, This day might I, reclining on thy neck, Have utter'd Edward's praise—that thought is flown, And each fond project of my heart o'erthrown. When from thy wound I drew the British dart, And with these lips embalm'd th' envenom'd part, Would that the poison like a subtile flame Had scorch'd my entrails, and dissolv'd my frame!’ She ceas'd—her eye emits a weaker glance, While her dim reason fades into a trance: The Youth, as if indignant of delay, Drops her pale hand, and turns abrupt away: Then to the partners of his fate he cried, ‘Ye willing victims, to my soul allied, Forgive, if passion's all-subduing pow'r Dare to profane this high important hour; Now, free of weakness, clear of love's controul, I lead the way that runs to virtue's goal.’ Arriv'd at Edward's tent, the dauntless Youth Resum'd—‘Invested in this garb uncouth, If, at thy bidding, thus we meet thine eye, For grace (the coward's hope) we heave no sigh; Since acts of slaughter are thy soul's best food, Oh, gorge thy rav'ning appetite of blood!’— Now with the glowing Youths, of equal mind, In one resolve, one hope, one peril join'd, He stands, unaw'd by death, sublimely great, True to his cause, rejoicing in his fate. But other scenes of high illustrious fame Burst on my soul, impatient of their claim: Behold! th' Enthusiast, freedom to regain, Leads her stern Barons o'er the sacred Plain; To the proud Monarch they exclaim—‘Thy hand Has touch'd the hallow'd ark that wisdom plan'd; The bending seer, with sorrow's weight opprest, Who beats in his despair his wither'd breast, Shall sooner from his tortur'd mind efface The wretch who plung'd his daughter in disgrace, Who in his sight compell'd her to his arms, And rudely ravish'd her untasted charms, Than we forgive thy violating pow'r, That wrested Freedom from her native bow'r.’ They spoke—each battle-axe, now rear'd on high, (Catching the splendor of th' unclouded sky) Cast on th' illumin'd field a sudden light, Whose rapid flash o'erpower'd the monarch's sight: Upbraiding thoughts his wav'ring mind assail'd, And fear, the tyrant's curse, his aspect pal'd: At length he seals, with mean, reluctant soul, (To Britain ever dear) th' immortal Roll. Now thro' disclosing skies th' angelic train Pour on th' enraptur'd ear the choral strain: ‘Be cheerful praise, be salutations paid, And hymns symphonious, to the godlike Maid, Whose energy resists the tyrant's plan: Joy be to Saints, and liberty to Man!’— From Time's dark gulph, revolving back to light, What new-born image rushes on my sight? The bold Columbus dedicates his sail To the wild breathing of a stranger gale: Th' Enthusiast bids his dauntless soul explore Realms unreveal'd, and seas unplough'd before: The hour now ripening in the womb of time, Th' inspir'd adventurer reach'd the point sublime, The long-obscuring veil for him was furl'd, And on his vision burst another world! Ecstatic Wonder heard the proud event, And o'er the ocean the glad tidings sent: Then Industry, as by electric stroke, From her enduring sleep instinctive broke: With brightest omens of her future reign, This better Venus rising from the main, Saw from all harbours, rushing with the tide, Unnumber'd vessels at her beck'ning glide: Did it not seem as if the sever'd earth, Like two fair sisters parted from their birth, Acknowledging at length their kindred race, Felt the warm transport of a first embrace? Now the same age a different scene presents, And the bold vision labours with events: Methinks I see, extending wide around, A tow'ring wood with crowding leaves imbrown'd; Beneath whose vast display of deadly shade Her listless length lethargic Europe laid: There Superstition her deep plan design'd Against the awful sanctuary of the mind: There the wan sorceress, haggard fiend of hell, Midst her dim orgies mutter'd the dread spell. The sun abhors to pour his radiant flood O'er the dumb horror of the slumb'ring wood; Yet thro' the gloom of sacerdotal night One peerless star reveals a cheerful light: Ah! why in mystic strains eclipse his name? Demand, Oh! Luther, thine unbounded fame: Advance, advance, thou elder son of Truth, Sublime, all-daring, restless, ardent youth! I now behold th' enthusiastic Maid Rushing impetuous to her fav'rite's aid: She reaches to his lips a cup of fire, Whose living drops the leaping pulse inspire. Revealing now his mission from the skies, He utters to the torpid world—‘Arise!’ The sullen forest, wrapt in tenfold night, Swift thro' a thousand vistas drinks the light: Th' imprison'd tenants burst the mental tomb, While from their eyes recedes the massive gloom: The flaky clouds admit an orient ray, And laughing Morn unlocks the gates of day. Prompt Apprehension sends her view around, While her bold thoughts o'erleap their former bound, And Joy proclaims throughout th' applauding earth The hallow'd festival of Reason's birth. Now the couch'd mind reveals its spotless eye, Weak to sustain the splendor of the sky, Till strength'ning at th' irradiating gleam, It meets unblenching Truth's refulgent beam: So when the keenly-glitt'ring darts of light Pierce the loose film that dims the eaglet's sight, First with an ignorant and coy survey The dazzled bird admires the stranger day, Then glancing on the sun with tow'ring gaze, Kindles his vision at the noon-tide blaze. Meek Toleration, heav'n-descending Maid, A vernal rainbow glitt'ring o'er her head, Smooths the rough path destructive feet have trac'd, Adorns and peoples Persecution's waste: She, like the Flora of the Pagan reign, Sprinkles with roses the enamell'd plain, Bids ev'ry flow'r of ev'ry clime arise, And freely breathe its incense to the skies. See Superstition, madd'ning at th' alarm, Extend, in thunder cloath'd, her threat'ning arm, But with'ring at the heart she rues the hour, That harshly severs her diminish'd pow'r: Thus as the serpent, sleeping on the plain, Feels the rude pressure of the loaded wain, With apt revenge, and indignation stung, She rears her crest, and darts her fiery tongue; But impotent of rage, her trailing wound She languishingly sweeps along the ground.” Here clos'd the Seraph his illustrious theme, Which on his audience flash'd conviction's beam. —And now th' Enthusiast, with her hand high-rear'd, Express'd a look demanding to be heard: The circling Hierarchy, with one acclaim, Urge her to vindicate her injur'd fame: She, to their judgment fearlessly consign'd, Thus pour'd th' effusion of her glowing mind:— “Bold on a tow'ring rock, with soul elate, I saw Britannia sit in regal state, Around the globe she threw her vast survey, And mark'd the realms devoted to her sway: Her Western clime, her Oriental reign, Her glory's theatre th' unbounded main: I thus address'd her—‘Hail, immortal Dame, Who, high-exalted, crowd'st the seat of fame, Suspend the thoughts of thine imperial state, And listen to th' event that heaves with fate— A prosp'rous mother (so did Heav'n ordain) Bless'd and ennobled by a numerous train, Beheld (a stranger to affection's tie) Her youngest born with a disclaiming eye, And, breaking loose from ev'ry moral band, Stretch'd o'er th' innocuous babe an iron hand, And, hard'ning in her wrath, the helpless child Was from her presence and her thought exil'd: This little outcast lately I survey'd, As mid the flow'rets of the wild he play'd, Artless and gay, himself the wilder flow'r, Bare to the with'ring heat and quenching show'r.’ Britannia quick return'd, with loud acclaim, ‘Oh piteous infant! Oh inhuman Dame! Where, where does she abide, that I may dart The shaft of death into her wolfish heart?’ 'Twas then I added, with indignant air, ‘Dismiss thy threats, thy warm resentment spare, Or droop thyself beneath a flood of shame, Thine, thine the child, and thou th' inhuman Dame.’ I said—and throwing back my flowing vest, Disclos'd the infant clinging at my breast: ‘Behold,’ I cried, ‘this flow'ret of the wild, This orphan nursling, this rejected child, Mark how around his brow of virtue's mold The signs of greatness dare ev'n now unfold; How on the vigorous eye the morning ray Preludes the splendor of meridian day: Oh! doom'd to act what Heaven's dread thought devis Thou at the font of Energy baptiz'd, Marvellous infant! doom'd to act my plan, Americanus, hasten into man!”—” ‘Enough,’ th' abruptly-rising Quire exclaim, ‘Aspire, Enthusiast, to thy wonted fame; Thy virtues, claims, and eminence we own, Resume thy dignities, ascend thy throne: Still to frail man thy daring strength impart, Still flame th' incentive Seraph of his heart; And when the scenes of earth shall fade away, And man shall need no more thy active ray, Then, sacred object of our praiseful theme, Bright emanation of th' eternal beam, Thou shalt regain thy native, dread abode, And glow for ever in the breast of God!’ AN APOLOGUE. Woo'd by the summer gale, an Olive stood Beside the margin of the silver flood, Beneath its playful gently-wav'ring shade A Syrian Rose her Eastern bloom display'd! The flow'r complain'd, that stretching o'er her head The dark'ning Olive a broad umbrage spread, Or if admitted to a partial view, Her blushing leaves imbib'd a yellow hue. Not unattentive to the mournful strain, The Master heard his Syrian Rose complain: The ready axe soon urg'd the fatal wound, And bow'd the stately Olive to the ground! The Rose exulting now with full display Gave all her beauty to the garish day; But soon her triumph ceas'd—the mid-day beam Pour'd on her tender frame a scorching stream: The Rose now sick'ning, drooping, languid, pale, Call'd the soft show'r, and call'd the cooling gale; Nor soft'ning show'r, nor gale with cooling breath, Approach'd, to save her from untimely death. The humbled Olive saw the Rose distress'd, And thus with dying voice the flow'r address'd: Ah! were it not that low-born envy stole With all its rancour on thy yielding soul, I might, attir'd in youth's unfading green, Have still embellish'd the surrounding scene; And thou, detaining still th' admiring eye, Have breath'd thy little incense to the sky! THE ROOKERY. Oh thou who dwell'st upon the bough, Whose tree now waves its verdant brow, And bending shades the murm'ring brook, List to my woes, dear sister Rook! And when thou'st heard my mournful lay Extend thy wing, and haste away; Lest pinion-maim'd by fiery shot, Thou shou'dst like me bewail thy lot; Lest in thy Rookery be renew'd The tragic scene which here I view'd. The day declin'd, the evening breeze Gently rock'd the silent trees, While spreading o'er my peopled nest I hush'd my callow young to rest; When suddenly an hostile sound, Explosion dire! was heard around; And, level'd by the hand of fate, The flying deaths transfix'd my mate; I saw him fall from spray to spray, Till on the distant ground he lay, With tortur'd wing he beat the plain, And never call'd to me again. Many a neighbour, many a friend, Deform'd with wounds, invok'd their end; Loud uttering omen'd sounds of woe 'Gainst man, our unrelenting foe. These eyes beheld my little brood Fluttering in their guiltless blood, While trembling on the shatter'd tree At length the gun invaded me; But wayward fate, severely kind, Refus'd the death I wish'd to find, Oh! farewell pleasure, peace farewell! And with the gory Raven dwell. Was it for this I shunn'd retreat, And fix'd near man my social seat? For this destroy'd the insect train, That eat unseen the infant grain? For this I cheer'd (with many a note Resounding from my artless throat) Yon dowager of reverend mien? Who dignifies the rural scene! TINTERN ABBEY See the account of Tintern Abbey by the Rev. Mr. Gilpin, in his Observations upon the River Wye.. Mark this lone seat, by Contemplation plann'd, This awful relick of monastic day: Beneath the touch of Time's reluctant hand Slow mould'ring in the silence of decay. Nature her shelt'ring moss around has thrown, As if in pity of the fading pile, And ev'n to cheer what sorrow calls her own On ruin's brow has bid her flow'rets smile. The rifted arch from all connection starts, The prostrate pillars stretch along the vale, Yet mid the wreck of corresponding parts, ‘One column stands to tell the mournful tale.’ TO THE BARON NOLOKEN, THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR, ON HIS SUDDEN RECALL. Thine the applause which (to long merit due) Those judges pay who are to honor true: Still, as before, thou art to all endear'd, Depos'd, yet courted, and tho' fall'n rever'd. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY HERVEY. Late in the Graces' annals have I read The myrtle wreath adorn'd your youthful head; That you unrival'd trod th' Idalian green, And that the Loves elected you their Queen: Of jealous time despise the trivial harm, Still by your wit you conquer, reign, and charm; The learn'd throughout the realm your genius own, And Hervey only has exchang'd her throne! TO THE MEMORY OF THE LATE LADY JERNINGHAM. LINES WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM AT COSSEY-HALL, NORFOLK, THE SEAT OF SIR WILLIAM JERNINGHAM, AUGUST THE 4TH, 1786. I. Thou, to whose sacred page the parting guest Confides the workings of his grateful breast, With awful pleasure o'er thy form I bend, My gift to bring—as brother, guest, and friend. Farewell, ye shades! (ah! not to fame unknown) Where Elegance has rear'd her attic throne: Whose beauties, to the pure of taste address'd, In Nature's charms munificently dress'd; Whose soft amenity, with grace combin'd, Display the emblem of the master's mind: Farewell!—Say, shall I not regret the bow'r Where social intercourse endear'd the hour; Where she, whose footsteps bless this sylvan seat, The pride and mistress of this calm retreat, Her soul illum'd with Wisdom's piercing beam, Sheds round her circle the enlight'ning gleam! II. Ye scenes o'er which I cast a ling'ring view, O'er which affection breathes a warm adieu, That hour I now recal with pleasing pain, Which gave your beauties to my wish again: Yet then, as I approach'd your smiling shore, Prompt expectation gladly flew before: Wing'd with gay hope, as nearer still I drew, Hills, plains, and woods assum'd a brighter hue: Soft-wreath'd in lilac vestment, laughing May With hailing aspect met me on the way; The various vale with eager steps I press'd, Praise on my tongue, and transport in my breast: O'er each lov'd spot I sent a fond survey, Where in the morn of life I wont to stray; The winding walks by memory endear'd, Where with the growing plants my youth was rear'd, Embow'ring shades, in whose deep gloom immers'd, Reflection fed me, and the Muses nurs'd, And, screening from my view ambition's sky, Pour'd other visions on my raptur'd eye. III. Yet, Album, ere the willing task I leave, Warm from the heart these closing lines receive. 'Twas at the hour to contemplation due, When evening meekly from the world withdrew, Beneath an aged oak, in pensive mood, I Sorrow's solitary captive stood: When, from the rifted trunk's obscure recess, A voice breath'd forth, in accents of distress; “Where! where is she! of mild and rev'rend mien, “Once the lov'd mistress of this sylvan scene?”— “Fall'n—fall'n—fall'n—fall'n!”—a distant voice replied: The branches shook, as if to sense allied: Wild Terror flung his strong enchantment round, And evening hurried into night profound! Now fond remembrance turns a willing sight, To dwell on gayer scenes of past delight, Pleas'd to behold her, midst the polish'd train, With grace, with dignity, her part sustain. To mild festivity by nature prone, With inbred wit peculiarly her own, Prompt ev'ry sportive incident to seize, Diffusing pleasure with a careless ease; Of pow'r to charm invincibly possess'd, Unfelt she glided into every breast. There are, who, fram'd with an enlighten'd taste, High on the critic form by judgment plac'd, Who (marking well her sense with strength combin'd, The scintillations of her playful mind, An aptitude that never lost its aim) With brilliant Sevigne in wreathe her name. To discontent, the vice of age, unknown, Her chearfulness maintain'd its envied throne: The gay, the old, the learned, and the young, And they whose heart pure elegance had strung, By the soft pow'r of her enchantment won, Would oft the glare of throng'd assemblies shun, To court her ready wit's enliv'ning beam, And bask beneath its undulating gleam. Yet oft from these unnotic'd would she steal, To soothe the bed-rid stretch'd on Torture's wheel, To smoothe the furrow on Misfortune's brow, To warm the timid, and exalt the low; With lenient hand administer relief, And close the bleeding artery of grief. Ah, ever dear! ah, venerable Shade! Indulge this honor by Affection paid. Enthron'd in bliss, ah! yet forbear to shun This holy tribute from a zealous Son. 'Twas mine, attendant on thy evening ray, To watch the sun-set of thy blameless day; To see thee, weary of th' unequal strife, Shed the faint glimm'rings of exhausted life; And (heavenly Moralist, sublimely great!) At the dread opening of thy future state, Teach by example, to thy latest breath, Meekness in pain, and fortitude in death! END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV PEACE, IGNOMINY, AND DESTRUCTION: A POEM. “Rompez, rompez tout pacte avec l'impieté.” RACINE. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES JAMES FOX. Around th' enduring martyr's hallow'd shrine Their brightest flowers the holy muses twine! With roses blushing from the fields of war, Their skilful hands adorn the victor's car! And, for the candid brow of peace, they bring The modest honours of the early spring! But for the Peace that lifts th' imploring eye, From whose frail breast escapes the coward's sigh, No muse applauding one small leaf shall bring Of all the foliage of the early spring; But, from her bow'r, shall Ignominy rend A branch of nightshade for her gentle friend! These painful eyes behold an English peer (His weak memorial sicklied o'er with fear,) In humble attitude a suppliant stand, To claim the friendship of a murd'rous band! The plaintive breathings of the snow-wing'd dove Ill suit the imperial messenger of Jove! Who should, by long-excited vengeance driv'n, Bear in his grasp the thunderbolt of Heav'n. Oh, my lov'd country! time-ennobled realm, Where jealous honour still has watch'd the helm; Th' unclouded glory long to Europe known Which clasps thy loins like a refulgent zone: Say, will thy hand the hallow'd cestus tear, And yield thy virtue to the tainting air? For me—unmark'd by honours, wealth, or fame, No swelling title blazoning round my name!— To be a fleeting bubble of thy earth Inflames my mounting soul with pride of birth! Oh, sacred parent! still thyself revere; To honour's call, to virtue's voice, be near: Blur not the brightness of thy heav'nly cause With one dim moment's intervening pause. Better to fall in glory's full career, Embracing honour on th' untimely bier; Than weak, subdued, with agonising strife, Waste (in the socket) the last gleams of life. Say, if to cloathe with light the laughing skies The God of Day were doom'd no more to rise, Were it not better, in the pomp of pow'r, In the rich ardour of meridian hour, To rush abrupt from Heav'n with downward flight A flaming chaos to the jaws of night; Than tinge the ocean with a ling'ring ray, Expiring in the silence of decay? Yet think not France from nature will depart, And chace the fiend that grapples to her heart; That the wild tigress will forego her prey, Couch with the kid, and with the lambkin play; That the fond child shall stretch his little hand To lead the lion in a flow'ry band! These beauteous emblems of the days of old With this mock concord no resemblance hold: No heavy drops of mandragóra steep The dragon's eyelids in the dews of sleep! The gift extended by a faithless foe Is the concealment of a lurking woe: 'Tis like the pause that Nature's storm bestows, An awful calm—the thunder's dread repose! My anxious eyes solicit still in vain Some sign that might my failing hopes sustain; Some sacred altar, rob'd in spotless white, Where candour's priest performs the genial rite; Where long-tried statesmen, fraught with wisdom's lore, Whose hair the hand of peace hath silver'd o'er, With learned fathers sway'd by virtue's rule, Whom peace hath tutor'd in religion's school; Where, pensive as they walk'd, the holy breeze Flew through the shady cloister whisp'ring peace. For these best pledges other scenes arise— Th' enchanter's cauldron smites my wond'ring eyes! Behold a troop of ghastly shapes advance In frantic mood, and form a horrid dance; Now bending low, these haggard forms of hell Breathe the dark pray'r, and mutter the dread spell: And now into the turbid stream they throw (With imprecations big with future woe) The galling tears that flow'd from beauty's cheek, The voice of agony and terror's shriek, The blood that trickled from affliction's dart, The sighs exhaling from a broken heart, The burst of anguish—murder's piercing cry, The screams that hurried through the midnight sky, The famish'd infant's deep expiring groan, The dungeon'd victim's solitary moan, The clotted hair which desperation tore, The milk of murder'd mothers streak'd with gore, The plaint of innocence, the virgin's pray'r Which the rude ravisher consign'd to air, The hallow'd edicts by religion plann'd, And holy wedlock's desecrated band: Behold the infernal sorcerers unite To close their incantation's fearful rite, And leering cast into the vase profound, The likeness of two skulls which once were crown'd. Say, for these fiends, if England can descend To weave the bond that grapples friend to friend, Flown is the spirit of her living fame;— And what remains?—a carcase of a name! Cou'd I, like Dryden, wield the bolts of war, And fling amazement from the rushing car! Did I possess that energetic strain Which pours the sorrows of the negro train, Brings the heart-rending tale to Britain's ear, And bids compassion pay her long arrear; The arguments that flow from Wyndham's sense, Well guarded round by reason's strongest fence; The sacred boon by Chatham's Son possest, The muse of eloquence that fires his breast: The quiver richly stored with attic darts, Which genius to his Sheridan imparts: Th' exalting winnow'd purity of soul With which Fitzwilliam soars beyond controul; Who, greatly daring, with a zeal severe Stemm'd the wild deluge of opprobrious fear; And, on the day eternally renown'd, Like Abdiel, was the only faithful found:— Had I these pow'rs concenter'd in one form, I'd pour on England the resistless storm, To wake her soul, to rouse her mental part, And chace her sombrous lethargy of heart. Do some pretend that justice holds the scales That o'er French councils honour now prevails? Approach the dial in the dead of night, Demand the hour by artificial light; Then virtue seek with an enquiring eye, Amid the system unillum'd from high. November the 12th, 1793. The Convention decreed that a spot of ground should be allotted for a burial place, with this inscription—“Death is an eternal sleep.”Mark yon sad cemetery's starless gloom, Where time shall ne'er unlock the rav'nous tomb, Where shadowy death shall a dread vigil keep, 'Midst the still horror of eternal sleep. There the pledg'd maiden, at th' approach of eve, O'er the dear relics of the youth shall grieve, While her dark creed shall urge the sting of woe, And bid her flowing tears for ever flow: Hope dares not whisper to her clouded eye To send a glance to time's unfolding sky, Where Pity weaves the amaranthine chain To circle lovers ne'er to part again. There, too, the mother, with affliction wild, Bends o'er the grave that holds her darling child, For ever holds—No pleasing vision cries, “Suppress the tears that trickle from thine eyes; “Ah! know thy child with angels soars on high “In the bright regions of the upper sky, “And, deck'd with wings that glitter to the ray, “Plays on the sun-beams of eternal day.”— Her dark'ning creed with no assuagement fraught, Forbids her soul to grasp the cheering thought! There, too, the friend his other-self shall mourn, From his habitual sight for ever torn; Forbid to look to that celestial shore Whose blissful bow'rs shall friend to friend restore: Thus the strong chain their sacrilege has riv'n Which bound in sacred union earth and heav'n; Made every future high reversion void; The rights of immortality destroy'd; Compell'd the claims of merit to be mute; Creation's lord degraded to a brute; And, what their hell-constructed thought design'd, Insulted nature and dethron'd the mind. July the 11th, 1791, Voltaire's ashes were removed to St. Genevieve.Behold where flow'rets deck the length'ning way, The slow procession moves in bright array: A gorgeous spectacle! ovation's car! Press'd by no hero slaughter'd in the war, But press'd by him who scatter'd wild alarm, And rais'd 'gainst Virtue his destructive arm: Who dar'd on Truth's bright shield, in evil hour, The poison'd shafts of blasphemy to show'r; His ardent vot'ries—a licentious crowd— Uplift their champion, fest'ring in his shroud, And, while the grave-worms fasten on his frame, High honours pay to his irrev'rent name! Pale Irreligion comes with all her train— Her atheist choir—to act the rites profane: She comes with all the witlings of the land, Her grave buffoons, her academic band! The steps of the fam'd Porch they now ascend, And through the pillar'd aisles their march they bend. An host of praiseful voices rends the fane, And impious echoes multiply the strain. But when the corse was to the vault convey'd, Night round the temple flung her darkest shade; With terror heav'd the sympathetic ground, From ev'ry altar breath'd a sigh profound; And fiends rejoic'd while angels wept around! Time was when France preferr'd her learned name, And wore the wreath bestow'd by classic fame: Mark the dread change!—the cold immoral blast Has chill'd the plants of Science as it pass'd, Nipt the young thought just bursting from its fold, And froze Instruction's current as it roll'd. See Education weeping on the ground; Her globes, her torch, her emblems scatter'd round; Her children all are fled!—the path, that leads To her august abode, is chok'd with weeds: She mourns her sabbaths and her rites suppress'd; She mourns her silent hours' ignoble rest. Who now appears the tutoress of youth, To cheer the darken'd mind with beams of truth? (With those clear rays which her bright noon adorn,) To streak and beautify her pupil's morn. From the wide-yawning ground, now bursts to view A form gigantic, and of sable hue; 'Tis Inhumanity—she comes to trace Instruction's precepts to the rising race: She feasts their minds—not with theatric show, But with live scenes of dire ensanguin'd woe! Gluts their affections with atrocious food, With acts of wrath, and festivals of blood! A battalion of children, from ten to eleven, were organised at Rennes, who were made to shoot old men of eighty.Behold her children, new to war's alarms, At her commandment grasp their little arms! Behold yon aged group, whose silver hair Demands compassion and intreats to spare! 'Gainst these—whose crimes are poverty and age, She bids her pupils act their virgin rage; And as they now impel the death-wing'd balls, Some benefactor, or some parent falls! With horrors deep'ning dye so early stain'd, In massacrous employ so early train'd, Will they not terrify the future day Whose rudiments of vice such proofs display? —'Gainst these to war is virtue's best crusade: She cries “Oh, England! hasten to my aid! “See atheist cruelty her weapons wield! “Lift to her blow thy consecrated shield.” Woe to the land, which (shamefully secure) Shrinks from the toil that wisdom bids endure, Declines the steps of glory to retrace, And shuns calamity to meet disgrace!— Misfortune is the night expecting day; Disgrace a stain that seas can't wash away. Ev'n while my soul from indignation strong, Pours the full torrent of reproachful song! Alluding to the departure of Lord Malmesbury from Paris, which event took place while the New Edition of this Poem was preparing for the press.Weak Embassy beholds with sorrowing eye, Her flutt'ring pray'r ascend an iron sky: The gaudy pile which airy Hope had rais'd, On which half-trembling Caution fondly gaz'd, Dissolves—and like a dream that mocks the mind, Leaves not a glimm'ring of its pomp behind: Then seize, oh Britain! seize the pregnant hour, 'Tis Honour's treasury, 'tis Virtue's dow'r! Thy vaunting foe misled, rejects thy claim, Absolves thy vows, and gives thee back to fame: Seize, seize the hour—with daring thought imprest, Bid the chill fear-drops gath'ring on thy breast Melt into air, like the small gems of rain Which the rous'd lion scatters from his mane. Yes! I adjure thee by thy days of yore; By thine illustrious fame's untainted store; By all the rev'rence thy great statesmen claim, Who rais'd, on Wisdom's plan, thy wond'rous frame; By all thy sacred bards, whose magic lays Sound in thy porch, and dignify thy praise; By thy benevolence—that brilliant gem Whose lustre plays around thy diadem; By all the charities that most endear; By Emigrancy's meek imploring tear; Thou'lt not reject her at her utmost need, Nor plant thy footsteps on the broken reed:— Yes! I adjure thee by the sainted train, Who, heav'n-instructed, rear'd thy modest fane; Gave to thy holy lips a purer pray'r, Whose chaste ascension breathes celestial air. Thou, who hast long attain'd th' immortal goal While choral plaudits sound from pole to pole! The glowing sun-set of whose honour'd day Expands the brilliance of meridian ray: Who hast from states remov'd th' incumbent shade, And the wide sphere of government display'd; The distant azure of whose vague extremes Thou hast illum'd with Truth's unerring beams: Our houshold deity! who warns, foretells, Points to the den where the hush'd monster dwells, Presents our perils awfully to view, And bids the Country to herself be true. Oh, Sage of Beaconsfield! indulge the muse Who the same track (thou hast adorn'd) pursues! Who gleans thy scatt'rings, grasps the falling grain From the full harvest of thy loaded wain! At the close of this Poem were originally introduced some lines, which censoriously mentioned a gentleman, whose great abilities have embellished different walks of literature. The availing myself of this opportunity of publicly acknowledging my error, respecting Mr. Knight, does not arise from the presumption, that a shaft from so feeble a hand could have excited any painful sensation in his mind; but from a view to silence the upbraidings of self-reproach. The same motive induces me to express my regret at some lines, which alluded to an ingenious young gentleman of Lincoln's Inn, J? J? D?, Esq. who is hastening to eminence in his professional line. To the Author of the Baviad no apology can certainly be due, and therefore I retain the lines which, though not immediately connected with the Poem, were generally allowed to be applicable to the person. In speaking of the peace of 1796, the following verses were inserted in the preceding Poem: “Ere I wou'd fix th' irrevocable seal, “And legalise what time can ne'er repeal, “I'd rather by the Nine accurs'd produce, “The harsh crab vintage of the Baviad muse; “Whose cynic numbers, not devoid of art, “Spring from the workings of a bilious heart: “Coarse, unrefin'd, inelegantly keen, “The foul o'erflowings of self-tortur'd spleen.” It is an observation of Mr. Pope, that as a beggar, let him be ever so destitute, has the means of keeping a cur; so the most indifferent Poet has merit sufficient to attract the notice of some bristled snarling critic. In this point of view, the Author of the Baviad may be said to be my cur!—an office I hope he will long retain. This Poem was translated into French by the reverend Father Mendar, Member of the learned order of the Oratorians. This gentleman is now returned to his relations in France. During his residence in this country, he distinguished himself by a peculiarly persuasive and pathetic manner of preaching. His little Poems of the Solitaire des Bords de la Tamise, and Les Remercimens, are warm and elegant effusions that may be properly denominated the poetry of the heart. But the most gratifying incident relative to this Poem is the letter I received from Mr. Burke on the occasion. As the smallest particle of a shattered diamond is valuable, so any fragment of so great a man is worthy of preservation: and under that consideration I yield to the partiality of some friends, who prompt me to annex the letter of Mr. Burke to these notes. “Beaconsfield, 18 Dec. 1796. “MY DEAR SIR, “You will have the goodness to excuse me in using the hand of a friend in making the acknowledgments, which are so justly due to you, on my part, for the valuable present of your Poem. The public is much concerned in this exertion of your genius, and my fame (if fame can be any object to me) gives me a concern in it. The least use I could make of my hand, would be to make it express the dictates of my heart on this occasion; but the truth is, I have been, and am, extremely ill, and there are few hours in the four-and-twenty, in which I am not obliged to pass in my bed or on my couch. “Infirmity does still neglect all office.” I assure you, however, that I read your Poem with great pleasure. The conceptions are just, the sentiments affecting, and the pictures forcible and true. I can say that I am not particular in this opinion, nor am I bribed to it by your indulgence to me, your fellow-labourer, in the same cause.—Mr. Wyndham, I understand (and he has a judgment not to be deceived or corrupted by praise) thinks of your Poem as I do. “I have the honour to be, with the most sincere regard, dear Sir, your most obliged and most faithful servant, “Edmund Burke.” EPILOGUE TO THE TATLERS, A MANUSCRIPT COMEDY OF THE LATE DR. HOADLY, Performed at Covent Garden, for the Benefit of Mr. Holman, and spoken by Mrs. Mattocks. The rights of women, in this cens'ring age, Have yet not been asserted on the stage: For one great branch of our defrauded right, Where hangs the glowing fruit of home-delight, I now appear, to move a new decree, And plead the female cause without a fee. Two scions on one plant, will not now bear A chaste allusion to the wedded pair. Behold! unfeeling Dissipation rends Wide from each other the connubial friends The travelling spray by whim's still varying lot Is seen ingrafted on some distant spot, While the poor widow'd sprig appears to moan Left to the blast unpitied and alone: But our new code forbids the youth to roam, And calls with dove-like voice, the wanderer home; We therefore hope our mates wo'nt think us rude, If from our plan all grafting we exclude. Do some now present daringly maintain, That roguish wives oft snap the wedlock chain? What? if the rover will not share his life With that domestic fixture called a wife, Should the wild truant man forsake the scene, Must she be stil'd an abdicating quean? If from their residence th' incumbents stray, Can it be said the living runs away? Then let the wives for residence contend— To this one point let our exertions bend; And if deserted we'll no more endure it, But in their absence shall appoint a curate. The laws of wedlock are the laws of rhyme, A faithful couplet, in accordant chime: If the first line should not exactly flow In perfect symmetry with that below, Ah! then we look for harmony in vain, And savage Dissonance deforms the strain. Some modern dames, indeed, have thought it sweeter To stretch the couplet to a triplet metre; Our code disclaims this license of the time, Firm for one couplet and one echoing rhyme. Long time entangled in the wedded noose, The city husband and his cackling goose, Half-tir'd, half-pleas'd, without delight or strife, Still, side by side, they waddle on thro' life: This drowsy pair we hold not up to view As a complete example to pursue: We wish the men would rather look on high, And note the lark that warbles to the sky. Nature to this sweet bird alone has given, To wake his carol at the gate of heav'n; Yet, 'midst the pride of his extatic strain, His faithful breast recals the humble plain, And sinking from the splendor of the skies, He joyous to his little mansion flies; 'Lights with gay pinion on his low-built nest, Where all his pleasures, all his wishes rest. Say, does our code, too selfishly inclin'd, Allow no absence of the length'ning kind? Yes! long privations we are doom'd to bear, And for our husbands shed the lonely tear; While for our Country's cause they plough the main, To crush the perfidy of France and Spain! When the rude voice of battle shall be mute, And they return from Valour's proud pursuit; The English wife a garland shall prepare, Breathing the perfume of the summer air. Unlike those high, too-fashionable bays, Which husbands wear in our degenerate days; But gay with roses and with heart's-ease join'd— Those emblems of the pure, delighted mind. On seeing some beautiful Lines WRITTEN BY THE Marchioness of Stafford, On the Death of the late Marquis. Thus falls the stately Oak, which long had stood The pride, the honour, of th' extensive wood: While the majestic form impress'd the ground, While the dark forest breath'd a murm'ring sound! Aurora op'd the portal of the sky, And view'd the ruin with a mournful eye: Then spoke—“Oh! be thou still to memory dear,” And on the branches dropt the embalming tear. LINES ON LORD CASTLE-ROSS Having obtained Two Prize Medals at the College of Old Hall Green, Hertfordshire. Hail to the youth! who round his honour'd name Entwines the blushing wreath of early fame; Who, urging onward in his first career, Gives like the spring an earnest of the year! Hail to the school, whose bright instructive ray Pours on the opening mind a flood of day; Whose precepts each subliming thought impart, Refine, exalt, and dignify the heart: Where Science, Virtue, Loyalty, reside, To form each youth his Country's future pride. TO Mrs. M???, On the Recovery of her Voice. Hark! the lost accents touch the gladden'd ear, The voice of candour, and of mirth I hear: Words that delight without the aid of art, And to each breast a secret charm impart. From darkness thus returns Aurora's ray, Diffusing light, and all the world is gay. LINES Addressed to the Horse of the Right Honourable Lady Cawdor. Proud of thy charge, O rare distinguish'd steed! Pursue thy easy way with quick'ning speed: Yet still observant of the prompting rein, That guides thy airy movement o'er the plain. Should'st thou with one false step betray thy trust, Grace, wit, and beauty, would be laid in dust. TO THE COUNT DE VERLAC, On his Translation of the Poem, “THE FUNERAL OF ARABERT.” Hail to the Bard! who o'er my humble theme Hath shed a warm irradiating beam, Who on my muse from forth his mental store, Breathes many a grace she could not boast before. Th' ingrafted tree thus lifts her cheerful head, And waves her branches with new honours spread: Proud of her foliage, proud of fruit unknown, Of fragrance, tints, and colors scarce her own. ON THE PORTRAIT of Mrs. JERNINGHAM, BY HOPNER. Here Art with Nature, fearful to offend, Asks only to appear as Nature's friend; To show to Time, when Nature's gifts decay, Th' excelling Beauty of the present day. WRITTEN AT THE TOMB OF EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE. O flow'r of Chivalry! O valour's stay! O miracle of England's earlier day! By pleasing awe, and holy musing led, A Bard now visits thy sepulchral bed. Ah! not the torrent of thy bright career, Nor close thy victories and honours here: When her red bolts Destruction's arm shall wield, And Time to dread Eternity shall yield! Thou from the little slumber of the tomb Shalt start—renew'd in youth's and beauty's bloom; And with thy virtues warring on thy side, Sublimely borne on Air's ascending tide, 'Midst men, 'midst angels, to thy triumph giv'n, Shall burst the radiant gates, and conquer heav'n. To MISS B????Y, On her Return from Italy. Tho' Wit's bright sun your sportful thoughts display, And on your converse darts a dazzling ray! Yet still we praise your magic's softer pow'r, When easy friendship smooths the social hour; When o'er another's pain dispensing balm, You round your bower diffuse a heart-felt calm! Thus in your summer mind at once are seen, Italia's sky, and Albion's soothing green. LINES Addressed to the Muse. Tell me, thou dear celestial Maid! To whom I have long homage paid, What attribute shall I bestow, What praises from these lips shall flow? To hail, salute, adorn, and greet The mistress of a proud retreat, Oxburgh, Norfolk Where Honour of the ancient school, Maintains its unsuspended rule; Where Virtue wont so pure to run Thro' many an age, from sire to son THE ANSWER. “Say not, her blushing smile to raise, “She's Wisdom's child—'Tis vulgar praise: “Nor say, that various talents spread “A triple wreath around her head. “Call Fancy to pourtray the fair, “And Truth, to check her hand, be there: “Now bid the limner Fancy trace, “With pencil light, each mental grace: “Behold! she decks the task enjoin'd, “And paints the features of the mind! “Delighted on the cheek to throw “Unalter'd friendship's warmest glow; “To form acute the list'ning ear, “Affliction's distant sigh to hear. “Now, as destroying half she plann'd, “See! Fancy, with obscuring hand, “Flings (as of too much praise afraid) “O'er many a moral charm a shade: “The limner, now more bold and free, “Displays an emblematic key, “Whose whisp'ring mysteries reveal, “The pow'r thro' every heart to steal.” LINES ON “THE BAVIAD:” AND “THE PURSUITS OF LITERATURE.” “That falls out often, Madam, that he that thinks himself a master wit, is a master fool.” BEN JONSON'S SILENT WOMAN. 'Tis said, that when of late the Gallic Host 1797. With spreading sails approach'd the Cambrian coast, An ardent Welchman—at the sight impress'd— Swore, stamp'd, and fum'd; by rage and fear possess'd: As nearer still advanc'd the hostile train, Resistless fury fir'd the Welchman's brain; And now each day he haunts the pebbly strand The self-appointed guardian of the land: Does any vessel his wild vision meet, The maniac loud exclaims “The fleet! The fleet!” Thus, like our Taffy, acts the Baviad Muse! Who, with fell rage, the Cruscan Tribe pursues; Yet to degrade all other Bards he pants, Frets, bounces, bullies, rages, rhymes, and rants! Does any Poet wound his jealous eyes, The maniac “Crusca, Della Crusca!” cries. Oft have I seen, light-tossing on the main, A small bark, steering to Apollo's fane; Whose pilot rear'd no meretricious sail, To play and wanton with the flutt'ring gale: No gold-wing'd Cupids hover'd o'er the prow, To welcome Venus rising from below: This undeck'd galley, innocent of pride, Pursu'd her voyage thro' the swelling tide: That first, that last, that only safe resource— To Nature trusting for a happy course! Yet then, impatient of this humble prize, The rhyming maniac “Della Crusca!” cries. Say, shall this mock high priest of Censure's band Presume to fling his Vetos o'er the land? Did Nature call him to her holy fane? Or Genius, with infusing hand, ordain? Say,—does th' inspiring spirit of the sky, Vaticination, swell his pregnant eye? No prophet's mantle, flutt'ring thro' the air, Fell on our Cynic as th' appointed heir: But he inherits, from some kindred mind, A short rough jerkin of the drugget kind. At first, our author his great name withdrew, Prudish and coy to meet the public view; Suffus'd with blushes of the virgin bride, With soft refusal, and with modest pride; And sweet reluctant amorous delay Prettily shrinking from the garish day: Now the fond witling, eager for applause, Tears with intrepid hand th' injurious gauze; Bursts on the town, and bids the world admire The matchless works of Billy Giffard, 'Squire. If each bold Village-Hampden may withstand The little tyrant of his little land; May not the Muse, with equal right, maintain The long-earn'd honours of her small domain? Ye great departed shades! who, when on earth, Hail'd, with benign applause, the Muse's birth; O Chesterfield! O Chatham's sacred sire! O Gray! thou lord of the enchanting lyre! Beneath your fost'ring praise, a lowly muse Smil'd, like the flow'ret fed with heav'nly dews; And shall this flow'ret perish in her noon, Beneath the dull-ey'd peasant's clouted shoon? When Churchill enter'd on the critic war, With thunder clothing his loud-crushing car; Tho' party-zeal inflam'd his iron heart, And prejudice sharp pointed ev'ry dart; With glowing thoughts, his mind profusely teem'd; And, on his burnish'd armour, Genius beam'd: Meanwhile, th' illumin'd spirit, from her throne Beheld his course, and “mark'd him for her own.” But no such honours our defamer grace— The low-bred snarler of the mongrel race! Ah! may no muse, whom Nature bids aspire, Shrink, when this cens'rer boils with jaundic'd ire. This vaticide! whom Truth and Taste discard: This growling Zoilus! this male Poissarde! Image of Sycobax, constrained to stoop, By Envy's pang distorted to a hoop! Ah! may the heav'n-born Muse, still unappall'd, Her hymns prepare in Virtue's choir install'd; With honest pride her rightful claim assert, And rise aloft, disdaining critic dirt. —Thus the fair Lote-tree, in Egyptian clime, Lifts her gay head above th' unhallow'd slime; While, hovering o'er her form, th' inspiring pow'r No allusion has been made in the preceding Lines to the Translation of Juvenal, by the Author of the Baviad, because I have not read the Translation, and was deterred from the perusal of it, by the very learned, ingenious, and keen strictures inserted in the Critical Review; to which strictures the Author attempted a reply, and in a long, tedious, prolix pamphlet, laboriously endeavoured to vindicate his Translation, “And wrote about it Goddess, and about it.” The Dunciad.Breathes on her leaves, and wakens every flow'r! NOW from the Baviad Muse, we turn away, And to the other Bard direct our lay: Who, like Guy Faux, conceal'd within his cell, Arm'd with a sulph'rous torch allum'd in hell; Ardent to blow, with his destructive aim, To airy nothing, many a splendid name; And now exulting views, thro' Fancy's eye, Cowls, Scarfs, Lawn-sleeves, and Mitres tost on high; Critics and Playwrights, Poetesses fair, Divines and Lawyers, sprawling in the air! This gaudy vision that adorns his theme, Is but the stuff that forms a turbid dream: He wakes, but to lament his poor device; And is himself the fool of Paradise. Our active zealot, hast'ning to the field, Grasps, with profaning hand, Faith's hallow'd shield. Such half-fac'd champions the Great Cause disdains, Who forge malignant Persecution's chains; The principle of Toleration, that brilliant in the diadem of our ecclesiastical polity, this Protestant Capuchin would sully with his contaminating breath. This philosopher, at the close of the eighteenth century, wakes the old cracked trumpet of religious alarm. The man who has the folly to assert, that the existence of some unendowed nunneries among us will endanger the established church, may as well imagine a strong wall can be thrown down by a handful of flowers. When the Hugonots fled for refuge to this Country after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, several pamphleteers, instigated by the same spirit which inflames this Gentleman, endeavoured to disturb the reception they met with from Government. Those advocates for persecution contended, that the Hugonots entertained principles hostile to monarchy; that their dismission from France was to be imputed equally to their political as to their religious opinions: but the wisdom of Government was as deaf to their remonstrances then, as the reigning Administration is now to the clamours of such short-sighted scribblers. Within whose bosom, cold as Alpine snow, No heav'n is kindled, and no seraphs glow! Behold Religion, daughter of the sky! Soft rays of mercy beaming from her eye! With cautious steps she shuns the bruised reed, And sooths the heart Misfortune dooms to bleed! Our ruffian zealot stains her heav'nly face; Blurs ev'ry feature, cancels ev'ry grace; Rends from the brow of the immortal Fair Her white-rose wreath, and stamps a blister there. The reverend victims of Tyrannic sway Crowd to our coast, and breathe our milder day: An injur'd, firm, disinterested band, Whose hallow'd footsteps sanctify our land; On these meek martyrs of the general cause, (Tho' haply rul'd by less enlighten'd laws) Our holy Vandal, with resistless pow'r, Wou'd the full storm of fierce Destruction show'r; Yes, he would rouse Intol'rance from her sleep, And from the saving breast of England sweep The noblest images of God below; Men plung'd, for Virtue's sake, in deepest woe: But Britain scorns the persecutor's pray'r, And his wild war-whoop scatters into air. As the kind Father of the human race, Whose awful Wisdom in each path we trace, Some soft prevailing antidote bestows On ev'ry weed and noxious herb that grows! So of infuriate men to check the force Of their mad schemes, to stay th' intemperate course, He in his mercy gave a King, whose breast Glows and expands to innocence distress'd; With Ministers of high enlighten'd mind, Friends of the weak, and lovers of mankind: And gave fam'd Oxford, whose religious hand Extends her tribute to the suffering band. The University of Oxford, with a liberality and an expansion of sentiment that cannot be sufficiently applauded, presented to each of the French Clergy a New Testament in Latin. The book was printed in conformity to the text approved of by Urban the Eighth. This is a circumstance peculiarly delicate: it enhances the donation, and breathes, as it were, the perfume of mental charity. See the fierce zealot, with unhallow'd rage, Profane the shrine of our departed Sage: Edmund Burke. The same hypocritical veil I mentioned before is made use of, with regard to Mr. Burke: under the appearance of commendation, this writer insinuates the odium he wishes to cast on that eminent personage. He approves, in a note, of the pension that was given him; which he condemns, in the Poem, as offered with a view to a bribe— “Who calm'd the terror of Burke's claws in gold!” A little before this country had the misfortune to lose that great man, this critic expressed a wish that Mr. Burke would put an end to his literary labours, though it was universally acknowledged that the same vivid genius flamed on his later effusions which glowed in his earlier productions. That shrine, where Memory her vigil keeps! Where Patience murmurs, and Affection weeps! Where Friendship with an heart-felt homage bends! Where Grief (the nation's delegate) attends! —“Endow'd with all that Nature's pow'rs dispense, (She cries aloud) “Thou Jove of Eloquence! “Whose arm omnipotent, by Virtue strung, “The daring thunderbolts of Genius flung: “Thou Day-spring, from whence flow'd a radiant gleam, “While democratic darkness curs'd the beam! “Resplendent Moralist! what Honour plann'd, “Thy warning voice diffus'd around the land: “On thee my fond regret shall ever dwell; “O Guardian!—Champion!—Friend!—farewell, farewell!” Is, then, this Cerberus at the gates of Fame, Accurs'd and void of ev'ry honest claim? Tho' weak to reach the awful depth on high, And with th' undaunted eagle cleave the sky: On the bright God of Day unblenching gaze, Kindling his vision at the noon-tide blaze! Yet, would he but observe (intent to please) How Nature marries Elegance and Ease: (For oft along his path, devoid of grace, The splay-foot of Vulgarity we trace:) Would he apply, ere he prepares to hit, The patient chisel to his cumb'rous wit: Would he, with Truth's keen-glittering sun-beam, pierce The film of prejudice that clouds his verse! Himself subdue! his own familiar thwart, And tear the foul fiend Rancour from his heart: He might become a heav'n-commission'd sage, To mark our errors and instruct the age. So the grim rock, that hides his baneful form Beneath the swelling of the ocean storm; When Time, that sways the world, shall interfere, And bid the waves pursue a new career; —That baneful rock his lurking mansion leaves, Full to the view a pond'rous mountain heaves: And now, no more the mariner's dismay, Befriends his course, and points the safer way. LINES TO THE MEMORY OF MRS. DUFF. To this sad grave no common grief invites, No stale display of sanctimonious rites; Domestic virtues here, a drooping band, Around the hallow'd spot despairing stand: And here their lov'd departed mistress mourn, From the fond youth of her affection torn: Torn from gay life's short scene, in morning's bloom, To feed the jaws of the relentless tomb. Ah! when she fell beneath Death's tyrant pow'r, The polish'd world then lost its beauteous flow'r: In whose blest frame were happily combin'd, The feeling bosom, and th' illumin'd mind: A spirit finely touch'd by Nature's hand, Prompt to perform when Virtue gave command; Prompt on Affliction's wound to pour relief, And bind the bleeding artery of Grief. Friendship exclaim'd, while bursting tears ran o'er, ‘My prime, my stedfast favourite, is no more.’ Affection, to the bosom still more dear, Shrunk at th' event, and dropt her warmest tear; Religion rais'd her sacred hand on high! And said—‘see Innocence ascend the sky!’ ON THE DEATH OF Mr. PITT. O matchless Eloquence, with Wisdom join'd! O splendid Honor of the human mind! O sun-like Orb, which cheer'd the public eye! At thy extinction, Nature heav'd a sigh; She met thy birth with gifts unknown before, And o'er thy soul diffus'd a lavish store: Yet then those gifts from others to withhold, With jealous hand she crush'd the heav'nly mould.
