      <field name="fulltext">TO THE TRVLIE HONORABLE, AS WELL FOR VERTVE, AS NOBILITIE, THE LADIE ANNE Herne: Wife to that worthie and generous Gentleman, Syr Edvvard Herne, of the thrice Auncient and Noble ORDER of the BATHE, KNIGHT. Bound by desert, not meriting the same, Words (still) to giue for deeds, doth make me shame. Yet (Beautious) pardon, since the pouer Man Giues, (thogh not what he should) yet what he can. Thanks yeeld I you, (the pay of younger Brother) Let Heyres be franke, and not their Riches smother. What you request, I wish you would commaund, For so my dutie to your Vertue's paund. Vouchsafe this modest Booke, fraught full of wit, A subiect chaste, a Ladie chaste doth fit. Then, honored Anne, grace Honors Academie, Since Honor honoreth you, as much as anie. Your Eglets high Conceit, too well doth know, My Swallow Mvse, flies (for your pitch) too low. This stuffe is Shephards Gray, spunne course and plaine, Vnlesse that you this worke, (to grace) shall daigne. But as your outward shape is louely faire, So inwardly, you'ar Curteous, Debonaire. Your disposition milde, all faults will couer, And (as vnseene) you gentlie them do smother. My hope is then, that you will sweetly looke, With your all-pleasing Eye, vpon this Booke. Resolu'de whereon, your Votarie I rest, Liue happie, since manie through you are blest. The Phœnix faire, sprung from your Ashes sweete, As you, so her, in dutious sort I greete. Euer deuoted vnto your matchlesse Vertues, Robert Tofte. TO THE CVRTEOVS AND IVDICIOVS READER, AND TO NONE OTHER. Pardon to craue of Sottish Mvltitvde, That saucie giddie-headed Monster rude. Who knowes not when ought well, is, or amis, Of shallowe shickle Braine, a token is. Ile not so much, as (winde to begge it) spend, None grosely more, then Find-faults do offend. A golden Calse, I cannot worship, I, An Ape in purple, Asse in skarlet Die. My Muse (as yet) I neuer Marchant made, Who sells its wit for Golde, is Learnings Iade. My Scope is faire, and vertuous is my Feeld, Then pleasure great, this subiect needs must yeeld. Nor I, or anie, feare to be disgrac'te, As is my Muse, so is my Mistris chaste. No word obscene, no phrase lasciuious, You (here) shall reade, to tainte a Virgins blush. Hence (Enuie) then, goe get thee downe to hell, My Sunn's so bright, all mists it doth expell. (Learned) to you, my Booke, and selfe I yeeld, Against those Gorgons, holde forth Pallas Shield. Chiefly against an other worser Crue, (Oh pardon passion, when it speaketh true) Against such ydle Theeues, as doe purloyne, From others Minte, what's none of their owne Coyne. These buz about, like Drones, and Beetles blinde, Whilst (in them) Hunnie none, but gaule you finde. Against these Cheaters, and their shifting Rout, Vouchsafe your Cristall Shield for to hold out. Yee, royall Marchants-like, in th'Ocean deepe, Of endlesse Knowledge, venture, wealth to seeke. Nor feare you (when you vtter it at home) Those barbarous Brokers, that each where doe rome. And do their force (though weake God knowes) aduance, Conducted by their blinde guide Ignorance. Base Ignorance, the Foe most capitall, To Wisedome, Learning, and good Manners all: Oh doe but you, in your RIALTO rich, Of Cvrtesie, (nor is this Fauour mich.) Giue out, this Trash of mine, is like (no Like's the same) Your precious Wares, and I, shall malice shame. Do you (but once) commend this my poore wealth, And MOMVS straite (for griefe) will hang himselfe. Yours euermore, R. T. [THE FIRST DAIES MEETING, OF IVLIETTAES SHEPHEARDS.] [When wilt thou wearie be, of sighing forth my paines] When wilt thou wearie be, of sighing forth my paines, Poore heauie heart? whose teares extinguisht haue thy heate Why doth not this strange sire, which silleth all my vaines, My griefe consume (my coarse consuming) though tis great? With care and cries, to feede my soule, is my desire, No hope to heale my wounds within me bide: Alas I curse my selfe, yet honor I the fire, See then how farre, Loue drawes me on from Reason wide. Thrise happie Nature, of each mortall man in this, For they (in dying) of their ils, an ende doe gaine: But Spirits diuine cannot; Diuine their essence is, Venus immortall was, immortall was her paine. What said I? No. LOVE cannot die through deaths despire, For in the soule he liues, and soule can neuer die: On earth below, no creature is that takes in Loue delight, And Ioue (himselfe) his awfull power hath felt on hie. Woe is me in this strange sort, I perish (languishing,) I wish for death, yet how to perish doe not know: Wretched that wight, whose burning griefes aie doth him wring. Nor can them quench, nor die, to ridde himselfe from woe. But since, I to this mischiefe am predestined, Nor can death, to remorse, or pittie nothing moue: Of Gods ile craue, I may be metamorphosed Into those haplesse Birds, that still bewaile their Loue. [Most vniust lawe of partiall LOVE, which with thy malice slie] Most vniust lawe of partiall LOVE, which with thy malice slie, The lamentable Tragedie of chast Floretta, and kind Plaindor. Thousands of faults with iustice vaile, dost hide malitiously. Thou that thy traiterous selfe, dost faine, to be a sacred thing, And by a coloured greement, thousands vnto death dost bring. Most cruell law of loathed LOVE, that vnder friendships showe, Dost paint thy bloodie Massakers, and makst them holy goe. Thou that with vaine allurements fond, and with faire smiling glose, So many faithfull Louers in their fatall tombes dost close. Who cuttest off so soone of men on earth the vitall thred, Of such as for their loyaltie, and faiths, are honored. Who (fiend-like) suckst their blood, and as if thou still destned were To plague the world; the flesh of these poore murthred soules dost teare. Hast thou then this faire worthy Brace of constant Louers slaine? Whose memorie still flourishing for euer shall remaine. Hast thou them stifled through mischance, without remorse or ruth? Their flowring yeares, their daies, their yeares, in prime of their green youth. Ah too too cruell law of thine, and happie thrise our life, If that it were not subiect to thy ouer-ragings rife. But what is he can liue exempt from these thy amorous lawes? When euery puissant God what ere, this yoke as forced drawes. Then who can Loue commaund, when Ioue himselfe full oftentime, By him hath roughly bin controld, although his powers, diuine? And yet some comfort small it is to vs, though little gaine, The Gods to haue companions with vs, in this our paine. Then reade this more then wofull verse, beleeue it as your Creede, True Herolds of a message such, as hearts to heare will bleede. Though in this vncoth desart colde, LOVES hatefull enemie, Death keepeth his abode and court, and sleepe doth here abie. Where horror doth inhabit still, and fatall sisters three, Who to vntwist our threed of life, most willingly agree. Where hundred thousand hugie Rocks, sore bruisde with thunders might, And torne through long continuance, oftimes iniurious spite. Are to this place chiefe ornaments; though many a hollow caue, And deepelesse ditches, soundlesse pitts, as glories chiefe, it haue. Although in steed of corne, with thornes &amp; brambles it be sowen, And with the chillie spring of Isie waters tis ore-flowen. Although it be inuironed, with monsterous hedges thicke, Of blood drawing brambles, and although wild beasts abound in it. And that the swelling periurde sea, most fearefull to our eyes, The same doth compasse round about, with fome which thicke doth rise. So as no one delight at all (though little) doth appeare, Or seemes that euer Venus sowed her seede immortall here. That neuer here for to repose, did rest the beautious sunne, When he his daily course, in course with Maiestie had runne. In briefe, although this Iland be, of gastfull lands the worst, Where onely damnd dispaire doth seeke for to abide accurst. Yet liude there (here) not long agoe) a louely Shepheard faire, Whome cruell Loue, did vex and gripe, more then with monstrous care. A Shepheard sweete in euery point he was, and complete right, But that too soone his tender yeares cut off, were through despite. A perfect Shepheard faire he was, his mind and valour such, As all the rest of Swaines that liude in woods, he past, by much. The spoyles of wildest Beares, the rough sharpe skin of tusked Bores, Of Lions fell, and greedie Woolues, hang vp, vpon his dores. Strange hidious Serpents vgly heads, and Griffons Tallent clawes, Sharpe poysonous teeth of Dragons huge, with their most vgly pawes. About the little closing walls of his small house was set, As honorable witnesse of his valour more then great. Those were his hangings rich, and these his pictures set in gold, Which intermixt in sundrie sort, you still might fresh behold. A Sentence.No such braue furniture as is a deadly enemies spoyle, Whose colour nere is marde with dust, nor length of time can foyle. So is the battered harnesse rich wonne from our vanquisht foe, Which hung vpon our walls more faire, then gold doth make them showe. For with the same the honour of the owners victorie Is there enstald and registred, nor can it euer die. Thus, then this gallant Shepheard faire, not little to his fame, Adornd his house with sauadge spoyle, which he abroad had slaine. His armour, was his bowe, his clubbe, his Shepheards wreathed hooke, For harneis he of musket proofe, a leathren brestplate tooke. Yet nothing could ore-come, his more then vsuall common power, Still from the chase, and fighting he returned conquerour. Thrise happie, fortunate was his first bringing vp and birth, Not any gifts more excellent, Nature gaue on this earth. Valiant he was, and strong in limmes, well made and trimme withall, So faire as euery Shepheardesse in loue with him did fall. Blest therefore was he in his first greene youth as he deseru'd, Whome honour did accompanie, whom fortune alwaies seru'd. Thrise happie he, in his young yeares, till twas his lucklesse fate, That dismall Loue, his reason and his sense did captiuate. For then he lost his wonted force, and courage euery waies, And of his more then braue exployts, the memorable praise. He onely studied then alone, to nourish his sad griefe, To sighthe his secret sorrowes forth, and waile without reliefe. An Inuectiue against Loue.O more then cursed caitife Loue, thou wisedome dost annoy, Debashest reason sound from minde, and valour dost destroy. Wise men, thou makest worse then fooles, and makst them onely fit To hurt themselues, whilst obstinate, they stand well pleas'd in it. No pleasing obiect likes their eyes, but what doth threat them ill, What euill is, that loue they best, their ruine fostring still. They blowe the glowing coales, that burnes them with ore what desire, As doth the foolish flie, that spoyles himselfe within the fire. Poore soules bewitcht a thousand times, each man in carefull wise, Doth seeke to shunne what may him hurt, and from the same he flies. Each one doth deadly poyson hate, which doth abridge his life, And being pained, strait doth hunt with speede for succour rife. The true disposition of a right Louer.Onely, the peruerse Louer doth all hope of helpe refuse, He likes his pining griefe, and what doth hurt him still doth chuse. He blest himselfe accounteth that, not heald is his disease, His sicknes he doth honour, and to die it doth him please. Hard fortune, is this to him, yet his haps farre harder more, He waileth his mischance, and yet, his griefe he doth adore. His woes nere die, but still reuiue; Then happier liue you faire, You that be dead, in better case, then Louers plag'd, you are. LOVE then our Shepheards courage stout, did weaken with his rage, And reapt the sprouting fruit, scarse ripe, of his first happie age. Ravisht his senses, and to thousand dangerous harmes him drew, And after these disasters all, most cruellie him slew. This Shepheard, Plaindor called was, no creature like to him For force of armes for beautious shape, or vertues, halfe so trim. But heare I pray, how Cupid proud, in most malitious wise, Transformes himselfe to poyson strong for to deceiue our eyes. Who though he seemeth vnto vs as courteous, meeke and kinde, Yet but a poysoned wine (though sweete in tast) you shall him finde. Which we no sooner drinke, but that it doth vs mickle harme, Bereaues vs of our vitall spirits, and doth our Reason charme. This deadly draft who doth but tast, to die is certaine sure, And yet before his death longtime, he must strange griefes endure. Hard by this darkesome desart sad, there was a place most daintie, Where Autumne, in his season brought forth fruits, great store and plentie. Rich was it of all worldly things, but yet amongst the rest, For richest good, a Damsell faire surpassing, it possest. Most famous (for this beautious maid) was registred this place, Though at that time fewe men had had the hap to see her face. Her stature tall, made her in shewe like to a Princely Queene, Rather then one that in the woods and groues brought vp had beene. A description of a beautifull maide.Her flaxen haire which calmie windes did gently blowfull soft, Hung dangling downe, more fine then golde, in thousand curlings wrought. Oft (when she any leisure had) she twisted in the shade Those haires as nets, which many soules (to bow vnto her,) made. Her forhead of faire Iuorie, was, euen, pure, and large, No furrow there (disgrace to forme) the flesh did frowning charge. No bending wrinkle there was seene, nor painting to deface, The snowy whitenes, which is vsde to make more faire the face. Her eyebrowes, purest Ebonie, kept their proportion right, No pleasing show so prettily, the fancie did delight. Sweete shadowes for her sphere-like eyes which with their twincklings calme, From sunnie beames did them defend, which burned ouerwarme. Her diamond sparklingly swere such, and did so brightly shine, As those two lamps the Sunne and Moone, most glorious and diuine. Her piercing glaunces full of power, like to swift lightning were. When as the flash inflam'd from heauen, it selfe on th'earth doth beare. So rolde they'in her head, as greatest hearts they forct decay, And valiant spirits of men as slaues did bring vnto their bay. Dan Cupids darts they were, with which he vsed men to crosse, Who being vassels made most bale, did glorie in their losse. Dire Comets were they, like to such that danger do portend, And such were hers, for death they gaue to her, and to her friend. Yet they of shamefastnes did show to be the bashfull Cell, Where chast delight did daily vse for his disport to dwell. Her pure vermilion shorts, when she did smile had force and power, To show more perfect faire by odds then daintiest gilliflower. How sweet and cruell wast at once to touch so holy thing? What mortall griefe was it that tooke (but once asay) to him? Poore Plaindor can true witnes be, one kisse vnto his cost; Was cause that he his pretious life, and all his good daies lost. Her cherrie lipps, did closely bide, right Orient Pearle of Inde, No pretious Iuells, helfe so rich, you in that land can finde. From which Perculius vaiules, a pleasing sent did come, More sweet then Musike, more daintie farre then rightest Sinamum. Her louely cheekes (Sunnes blemish) were as Alablaster faire, Whose rascall colour mixt with creame, did show beyond compare. Her dimpled chinne was full and round; her brest the milkie way, Where Cupid, (when that he was hot,) a bathing often lay. Two Apples faire thereby was seene, as sprung from paradise, The Graces, in that garden vsde to sport in wanton-wise. Her matchlesse hand was long and strait; her fingers white and small, The mountaine snow refin'd to them, was nothing white at all. Such was this peerlesse virgins faire, and she FLORETTA hight, Blest perfectly, but onely that bad destnie ded her spight. One day as in the warming sunne, with mickle curious care, She did diuide and tide in knots, her shining bright gold haire. The harts of worthiest Demigods, here on the earth to trap, As Plaindor came from woods, to view her (thus,) t'was his hard hap. And being wearie, thought a while to rest him by her side, But this reposing afterward he dearely did abide. For vading pleasure ouer small, he too too deere did pay, But t'was his fortune bad, and downe along by her, he lay. Where he such poyson suckt, as t'was, within a while his bane, And where he rest did thinke to find, he found recurelesse paine. Thrise happie he, had, he not laid himselfe vpon that greene, Or if that forward he had gone, or, her he had not seene. For though his wearie coarse did rest, his mind did trauaile sore, Whilst his bewitched eyes, apace downe swallowed venim store. His gazing eyes nere from her face, one iot at all did stir, His eyes made onely to behold, and gaze on none but her. He markes with more then curious view, her forhead and her cheeke, Her haire, her brest, and other parts which hee too well did leeke. So rests attentiuely and still, leaping as t'were for ioy The conqueror proud, when he beholds his prey which him did noy. So standeth still the greedie' Iewe, to marke with heedfull eye Such pretious Iewells, passing rare, which he doth long to buy. Then, then, the haplesse Shepheard (first) perceiu'd the flame begin, To spred alongst his heart, and to consume his soule within. He then perceiu'd, of libertie he was depriu'd and sence, By those bright beames of that strange glittering beauties excellence. Then of his ill, the sillie wretch, had knowledge at that hower, Yet to resist, or to withstand the same, he had no power. He felt his captiue heart attacht, and roughly raught away, And yet for all this would he not, make of the same a stay. All meanes of helpe he banisht thence, and yet he felt the griefe, He saw, he was as one vndone, yet would not seeke reliefe. He was in prison, yet he did refuse his libertie, He found his error, yet not once (Peccauie) would he crie. He neuer sought to driue from him, this illiueuitable, Though, through the same, he found himselfe (for euer) miserable. Cruell effects of Loue; such Louers, as quite senselesse bee, Cannot auoid their hurt, although with eyes they doe it see. So in Florettas beautious eyes, Plaindor now captiuate, Where he should haue resisted, is proud of his lost estate. He counts himselfe thrise fortunate, that he thus vanquisht is, By so diuine a beautie, which he vowes his chiefest blisse. He, this his hurt doth better loue, then all his former health, His bondage, fore his libertie, he doth preferre and wealth. Ah Louers more then wretched right, worse, hundred times then hell Is your estates, and worse then death, (were it but death t'were well). To th'enemie of your sweet liues, your selues you doe deuote, Your hang-man you doe honour still, who seekes to cut your throte. You are not able once to shunne, to hate or to detest, That which doth make you languish, and you, tortureth with vnrest. You loue, what workes your miseries, and beautie (chiefest sore, To peacefull mindes of worthiest men) as Goddes you adore. Each one (excepting Louers) wrongd, reuengement seekes by lawe, Defends himselfe, and (being hurt) vpon his foe doth drawe. Each one (except the Louer) wars, against his Enemie makes, Hath reason to detest him, and against him vantage takes. He onely yeelds himselfe as slaue, vnto his owne distresse, He honoreth his tormentor fierce; his prison he doth blesse. Who remedie doth seeke for him, him he accounts no friend, He rather hates him mortally, as if he were a fiende. Good counsell vnto Louers.But were not Louers obstinate, did reason rule their minde, Thus peruerse still gainst their owne good, they would not be vnkinde. And thus doth Plaindor now quite change, from his first happie state, That beautie, worshipping, which he ought rather for to hate. As sensuall beast bereft of sense, his heart he offereth free, To her who seekes for to abridge his ioyfull libertie. As sacred, her, he doth account, and holdes her for a Saint, Who is the motiue of his mone, and subiect of his plaint. With great deuotion dotarde like, he vowes to reuerence That, which vnto his life doth seeke to offer violence. Thus from a man vnto a beast, he is transformed right, Whilst he doth seeke to gaine by losse, and Loue, which he should spight. Yet onely in this thing, his lucke was not ore passing bad, Since one, to beare him companie, he in his sorrow had. Floretta felt somewhat the darts of Loue, though not so keene, Which iustly seem'd diuided right these two young soules betweene. A little she did feele the heate, of this hot amorous fire, Which in the loyall Shepheards heart was kindled through desire. His personage, and valour now, her libertie had wonne, And as she, him, before, so now, he, her, had ouercome. Her milde behauiour showed the same; her colour, and her grace, And her two eyes which still were fixt vpon his manly face. Which rauished with selfe-like Loue, like to a mirror true, The one the others beaute case beheld, and sad did view. The stealing glaunces which they both cast forth alike did showe, That in one selfe-same Sea of Loue their hearts were dround with woe. Their vncoth heates, their scalding sighes, their amorous soundings sweete, Foretold that of one selfe-same cup, they both had drunken deepe. Shame onely then withheld their tongues from silence to vntie, And feare, least one, the others sute, vnkindly should denie. Both knewe they lou'de, yet, both did doubt, least they not loued were, They onely thought vpon that Loue, which both did willing beare. No signes betweene them yet had force (although) enough were showen,) To make the truth of both their mindes vnto their soules be knowen. Floretta building on her beautie faire, thought Plaindor lou'de, And that to yeeld himselfe her thrall, he easily might be mou'de. Her greatest doubt was, least he should not constant be, nor true, But in the ende would giue her o're, and cause her so to rue. Plaindor, againe could not perswade, himselfe so blest to be. As for to be belou'd of her, he thought she nere would gree. He not so much, as thinke so, durst, but rather did dispaire, Ere to enioy the thing he held, so deare, and thought so rare. He durst not once desire't, for feare, least being the same denide, He therefore should the greater griefe, in his successe haue tride. Yet in the ende this Shepheah poore, quite wearied with his paine, Tooke heart at grasse, though little lif within m'did remaine. His eyes fixt on the ground full sad, his eyelidds closed tho, And in his gesture many sighes forct from him too and fro. His trembling soule, full of pale dread, teares trickling downe ore warme, His minde tormented diuersely with many a fierce alarme. His bleeding heart prest downe with woe, which throbd and sobd through feare. And gainst all hope of future good, in combat as it were. His armes a crosse in wofull wise; (vnarmed he alone; Thus to Floretta in few words, his case he doth bemone. Diuine and rarest beautie; if the Gods haue heretofore Bin as I am of libertie, depriude, and which is more, Left their chiefe rest, whilst in themselues they bare as open signe, Such earthly beautie, as did seeme more like themselues diuine. Leauing the heauens, their darts and fires, their fortunes for to proue, Disdaining nought as souldiers braue, to march in Campe of Loue. If that their soules were scorched with this Archers fire so whot, As, for their wounds to finde some salue, to seeke they shamed not. If they, as I, felt thousand plagues, for louing as I doe, DEARE, then, that I endure the like, let not be straunge to you. Each seekes the steppes of these great Gods to follow, and though he, Doe somewhat erre in following them, yet ought he pardoned be. My heart (as theirs) I wounded finde, with darts most mortally, Which thou gainst me discharged hast from thy commanding eye. The selfe same fire that was in them, is seazde vpon my soule, From sparkels now, tis growen to flames, and lord-like doth controule. Burnt are my senses all, my powers consumed vnto nought, My reason is enchaunted sore, and I to ruine brought. If thee I see, I die, If not, I then doe pine a way, Thus by no meanes my sicknes strange, I swage can or allay. To quench this raging fire, I done haue what I can, alasse, But twill not be, although I would, I cannot bring't to passe. This onely now remaines for me, my life is in thy hand, If I shall liue, or die, the power as now, within thee stands. By thee alone I hold this life, for thee I die as now, That hope I haue thou nourishest, my feare engendrest thou. Sweete then take pittie of this Loue, like Caos so confuse, And graunt my hearts request, who there his aduocate doth chuse. Mine, ist not any more, thine eyes from me the same did take, Then being thine doe pittie it, and much of it doe make. Destroy not what is in thy power, but rather it preserue, In man, great wisedome tis, what is his owne, for to conserue. I craue not that thou me my captiue heart againe restore, To liue with so braue conquerour as thou, tis happier more. My wils (if any interest, longes to me in the same,) (As much I doubt since it I lost, no more I may it claime.) It still within thy louely bands, as prisoner true be bound, Nor in my brest his wonted place no more henceforth be found. Then since it is thine owne, and that an amorous sweete desire, To haue respect vnto his health and life doth thee require. Vnlesse thou on his fortune hard, dost take some kinde remorse, In thy chast amities pure heate, he needes must die of force. Ah then relent, be pittifull, in fauourable wise, And daine for to accept from him, this dutious sacrifice. For what can I offer more deare to thee, then my deere heart, Which nere would yeelde to Loue before, he felt this bitter smart. Which scornd his vtmost force, and lawes did vtterly reiect, And of his manly stomack stout, did showe full many effect. Then of so braue a vanquisht Foe, ore-come by beautie thine, Take pittie, and him gently vse, in this his captiue time. A Similie.Such gallant souldiers as be tooke in field by chaunce of warre, Be much respected; kindly vsde, and honoured much they are. And whilst as prisoners they remaine, and till their ransome come, All friendly courtesie to them in louing sort is done. Then to my humble heart (faire Dame) who thee doth honour deere, Not cruell be, as if thy foe whome thou should'st hate, he were. Ah gently vse him, or without thus suffering him to lie Still languishing, giue verdit strait, and he shall willing die. For if thy grace he may not gaine, he cannot liue on earth, A Sentence. Whose wounds are deadly, happie he, if ease he finds by death. Speake then Floretta faire to me, nor by thine answere sower, Be thou the cruell cause to force me leaue my life this hower. SWEET speake, for by their Oracles, contented are the Gods To answere men, yet greater farre then men they are by ods. So said the Shepheard, who in feare the summons did attend, Offortune good or bad, if he should liue, or life should end. A Comparison.Like to the guiltie criminall, who is of hope depriu'd, Whilst iudgement with great terror he expects to be disliu'd. His heart did paint full sore and fast, his face for feare did sweat, Mistrust did show in his sad eyes; feare in his soule was set. Disgrace and shame to be denide, his bodie gauld throughout, Who doth attend for what he longes, and languisheth in doubt. Thus wandred too and fro his vitall spirits in this state, Whilst that his life did seeme to him as ouer desperate. Tide was his tongue, and now it irks him that he ought had said, Wishing that he his secret wound to her had not bewraide. So doth a braue and gallant mind, by famine forct to beg Repent him, after that an almes, demanded thus he had. But at the last, the Shepheardesse dissolu'd these doubts confuse, Chearing somewhat the Shepheard, by these words which she did vse. The time hath bin, that Venus (though Loues mothers she) hath lou'd, Whilst self same plagues which she inflicts, on others she hath prou'd. Great Ioue, the President and chiefe, of all the Gods aboue, Did thinke it no disparagement at all to be in loue. Both Gods and Goddesse haue lou'd, then why should I be blam'd, Since but with selfesame spot I am (as they haue all bin) staind. Ioue, life hath giuen vnto vs, that we should follow him, A Sentence.To erre as Gods, is no offence, so praise, not blame, we winne. Then may I without scandall loue, as they before haue done, So as my loue in chastest path of loyaltie doe come. With such loue (Plaindor) thee I like, and hope this loue so strong, Shall be of force thy constancie to make endure more long. I loue thee; yet no power thou hast ore body mine at all, A Sentence.If once presume vnmodestly, ought to request thou shall. For no loue is that loue indeed, but rather furious rage, That seekes our honour with disgrace, or infamie t'engage. Then I will loue thee, yet of me, thy selfe nought else assure But my chast faith, which ile reserue to thee vnspotted pure. Vntill that happie time shall chance to hap to vs at last, When we by sacred marriage rights, may coupled be more fast. And with this Plaindor, be content, for what more canst require, Then of my loue to be assur'd, which is thy chiefe desire. The loyall wish of Louers true, is loue reciprocall, For where good meaning is and plaine, there, none is mockt at all. But for to loue for pleasure fond alone, in sensuall wise, Is brutish, like to beastes who show all reason to despise. Did I but thinke (Shepheard) thy Loue, not sober were, or chast, Or that within thy brest black thoughts (staine to my state) were plast. That from thy heart all honour thou and credit didst reiect, And more of pleasure (went onlike) then vertue didst respect. Assure thy selfe I would reuenge my selfe on thee, so sore, As for thy boldnes thou shouldst die, although I dide therefore. And I soone punish would my selfe for that I was so vaine, To loue a friend, so small of worth, as my chast minde to staine. My blood, shed by my hands should wash my fault and error bæd, Since I to make choyce of my Loue, no better foresight had. Floretta, nere shalt liue to morne, by taking such disgrace, Floretta, sooner flourish shall by death, which ile imbrace. Then Plaindor, liue, and thinke thy selfe, thrise happie for to be, Since of a vertuous Loue, thy selfe assured thou dost see. Meantime, looke to thy selfe, (attending that same blessed day, The haruest of our chastest Loue, when Hymen gather may.) To die; or say ought that vnto discredit mine may turne, For which death purging me, too late, thou then for me shalt mourne. He, that is wise, seekes to be Lord ore his affections, And he a conquerour is right, that conquers his passions. Be thou such one (deare friend) for who with prudencie doth cope, Findes his desires soone ruin dare, and nourished his hope. Thus wisely spake Floretta faire, whose golden speech so graue, Made Plaindor in his entrailes hot, a greater burning haue. Her sage discretion he admires her faith he doth adore, As sacred, he doth honour her, and likes her chast loue more. He could not iust, nor rightly giue a gesse, which did surmount, Of these two so rare qualities in her, of so great count. Her beautie faire, or wisedome graue, which most did her aduance, He was with them so ravished and out of countenance. For heauenly Allure we doe vse, to vertue to erect, And so, cause beautie conquereth mens spirits, we respect. Each of these twaine, sole by themselues, or, by themselues diuided, By men are raisde to highest rate, and as diuine are praised. But in one body, when alone this Twinne of vertue light, That coarse the beautie of the Gods, as then resembleth right. Tis heauenly, then, as they, and for to Loue doth willing draw The hardest hearts, and senselest Rocks of Epyr with great awe. With this rich Iewell pretious, is Plaindor rauished, And without stirring, thinkes that he vp to the heauens is fled. Immortall, and most infinit his glorie he doth thinke, More then the Gods themselues which do of flowing Nectar drinke. His heart in pleasures sea swimmes fast, as he himselfe requires, His soule doth melt through sweet conceit, in flames of his desires. His ioy doth keepe him tongue tide, and he thinkes he dreames as tho, Whilst in his minde, he diuers thoughts doth canuas too and fro. What he doth see, he credits not, nor can he easily deeme, That so rare beautie once will daine of him for to esteeme. He stands amazde like to that Prince from captiue bonds vnthrald, Who is from prison tooke to Throne, and there, anew enstald. He thought Floretta, flower of all, would nere haue stsopt so base, Nor that she ere ment in to write in Checkroll of her grace. Sad sorrow oft the constancie of man doth much annoy, And good things vnexpected, quite confound the minde with ioy. Thrise happie who the Center keepe, nor nere exceed the meane, Where neither good nor bad doth them torment with such extreame. Plaindor, then wakt out of his transe, with louely discreet cheere, Million of condigne thankes doth giue, to his Floretta deere. Deuoutly, he his faith protests, strictly to keepe to her, And that beyond Loues sacred bonds he neuer meanss to stir; To serue her faithfully, and that himselfe heele sooner slaie, Then to commit what should offend her humor any way. Faire flower, quoth he, light of my life, doe not me doubt at all, Thy will, a law, thy word, command, be vnto me still shall. Thy wish my chiefe desire Ile hold, thy glorie shall be mine, Thou wholly shalt be vnto me, and my soule onely thine. I neuer will forget my selfe, and when I first offend Against thy daintie selfe, I pray my life haue shamefull end. When, as vnconstant wauering wight, I shall like Haggard range, Of all the hellish torments fierce, then let me haue the change. Most wicked I, and most vnfit to liue vpon the earth, If when thou life to me hast giuen, I should thee quite with death. A Sentence.‘A fowler fault cannot be nam'd, nor that deserues more shame, ‘Then th'ungrate Louer, when he is vnthankefull to his dame. ‘For ther's no euill that so much craues succours speedie neede, ‘Then that which Louers doth molest, and makes their hearts to bleede. ‘Nor is there any cruell paine, as is the louing griefe, ‘For Loue consumes both soule and coarse, vnlesse it finde reliefe. ‘Then (Ladie) as thou mercifull hast bin thus vnto me, So I my seruice dutifull, for aie assure to thee. And if my fortune chaunce to prooue (by enuious destenie set) That I my selfe by doing what vndecent is forget) My blood shall wash my fault away, and rather this offence Shall ende my life, then periurde like with fault I will dispence. Doe so (replide) Floretta, and thou soone shalt see the day, When as our Loues shall happie prooue, though now they vs delay. But chiefely haue regard (boue all) that thou the cause be not, That my chast meaning through thy fault be staind with vitious blot. For should this ill chaunce hap, thou then (as I before said) soone, Shall seem (slaine by mine owne hands) to sleepe within my Tombe. Thus did these Louers twaine, themselues, one th'other oft coniure, And thus betweene themselues, their faithes (in secret) did assure. An example.As whilom was Dan Paris, with forsooke Enone seene, To plight their Loues most couertlie amongst the leaues so greene, But after they had to idea while, with many a pleasing word, After a thousand pastimes, as the yeare did then afford; With thousand louely glaunces quicke, one to the other cast, Which forst the amorus fire within their entrailes burne more fast. After a thousand pettie Oathes, with sports before nere found, To see, if of their fancies fixt alike were not the ground. After a thousand sugred smiles, and toyings delicate, Which more the mindes of Louers true, doth rightly recreate. After a thousand small disdaines, deuised for the nonce, And discontents, prou'd meriments, betweene these Doue-like ones. By which, from cinders, vnto flames, there heate did more encrease, By reason of this wanton warre, and amorous angrïe peace. After much woing (but no doing) the euening being come, And that the Sire of Phaeton, his course that day had runne; At last, Plaindor, nigh sunsetting, with ioy and meere content, Kist her faire hand with much adoe, yet prettily was shent. That done, (though loth) he bids adue vnto his Ladie bright, Being angrie not a little, that so soone was come the night. And laden richly thus with hope of her, whome he lou'd best, He home doth goe, where quietly he takes his wished rest. O rare beginning, faire commencement of two Loues so chast, O happie couple, whilst their daies so luckily were gract. O blessed Louers, if against your fortunes, heauens rage Not trauerst had to ruine you, in your best youthfull age. But when we thinke (puft vp with hope) that we doe flie aloft, Then soonest clipped are our wings, by angrie stars full oft. Then iealous of our glory, they doe seeke vs to destroy, Thinking, they gaine chiefe victorie when vs they can annoy. Thus, these two Louers vnto dire misfortune destined, By cruell Fates, in middest of their ioyes were ruined. Yet heare this wofull tale of them, and you will iustly say, That nothing long in this vaine world, continueth at one stay. Because Plaindor, for propernes, and strength, others did passe, He of another Shepheardesse, extreamely liked was. His two blacke eyes, made her eyes show, how nigh she was to death, Her colour for the loue of him, was like the fall of leafe. She fancied none but him alone, he was her onely treasure. And that she was thus thrald for him, she counted it a pleasure. But Plaindor, neuer thought on her, nor, for her ought did care, Alreadie all his Rest was vp, to like none but his FAIRE. He had no leisure for to iudge, if she did loue or no, So much for faire Floretta, did his strange affection growe. And so should be true Loue indeed, where two, should be but one, A loyall Louer should but serue his mistris, sole alone. For neuer hath it yet bin seene, that constant amitie Would ere disgest, that in the midst it should diuided be. This caused Plaindor not to loue, this wretched maiden poore, Who for his sake, perplexed was, and well nie at deaths doore.— Thus languishing, she followeth him, with pale and pitteous looke, Still seeking for to take that course which she should haue forsooke. She followeth him in Quest, and still she after him doth trace, Like to the Blood-hound good, the deare that followeth with great pace. Whilst he (good soule) full little thought that she ought to him ment, He, on his owne affection, so earnestly was bent. Nor could he scarce endure to heare her speake, or talke to him, Nor once to looke on her, although she proper was and trim. None but Florettas stainlesse shape, as beautifull he deem'd, All other fauours whatsoere, as Maskes vnto him seem'd. His soules sole ioy, and lifes delight, she was, and chiefe repose, She was his first choyse, and the last, that he through fancie chose. Yet in the end, this pleasure, which him lik't so, him deceiu'd, For she whome he did thus contemne, at last his loue perceiu'd. Seeing her selfe disdaind so oft by him, now growne so quaint, She doubted lest (whome he did serue) he had some other Saint. Which was the cause that hindred her, his fauour to obtaine, Resoluing with her selfe to seeke, till she had found the same. Imagining (but to no end) by some deuise herein To wade so far, as at the last, she Plaindors grace would win. But t'was the ruine of the one, and th'others ouerthrow, By too too soone vntimely death, as I to you will show. Plaindor expecting still the houre, when stormes should once be past, To reape with ioy (what he had sowen with sorrow) at the last. Building vpon Florettos faith, as on a rockie shelfe, Whome he more then the better part accounted of himselfe; Did yeeld his heart into her hands, in most obsequious wise, Breathing by her sweet breath, and taking life by her bright eyes. So as that houre he saw her not, he found himselfe to die, For then, the Louers chear'd, when as his Mistris he is by. Sometimes he would be with her, in the thicke and muddie shade, Sometime sit with her by some spring, which prettie murmuring made. And there while by fountaine coole, the heate from them to keepe, Or in some groue be tapistred, with flowers surpassing sweete. Then, in some Bower, by Nature fram'd, where they did often vse, Vpon the grasse in steed of beds, their lodgings for to chuse. Or (for to see the wanton fish) about some cristall poole, Or by some Isie riuer cleere, the more themselues to coole. Or in some hollow Rocke, the heate of scorching sunne t'auoid, Whose sparkling beames their tender flesh, too much oft times annoid. Or in some fresh and low deepe Caue, enuironed about, Like Baricados made for fence) with brier sweet throughout. In such like place as these they vsde, without suspect alwaies, In this same sort, to spend of their greene youth full many daies. Deuising many a louing toy, as harmelesse wantons doe, Which honour doth permit, whilst they their honour, honour too. One while they merrie Rundelaies together both doe sing, And with their cheerfull chaunting, make the woods throughout to ring. An other while with blushing cheekes, like to two Turtle Doues, One doth vnto the other tell, their first chast modest Loues. Then one the others beautie doth commend, and then againe They praise their plighted constancie, exempt and free from staine. And now, they prettie Babies looke, one, in the others eyes, Whilst loue, new subiects still of sport, to please them doth deuise. Forbearing alwaies, nerethelesse, by proffer, or by showe, Once to attempt, what any way might to dishonour growe. Whilst they poore soules, bare burning coales, yet quench them durst they not, Lest their good fame they should abuse, and their pure honour spot. This made them sound through hope, and sigh for want of their desire, Not daring reape their loues sweet fruites, as much they did require. They wish and yet are wide from it; faine, if they durst, they would, They will not doe (through vertue) what they thinke in sense they should. Sweet thoughts they haue, they sweat for hope, and yet they die through griefe, They haue at hand the remedie, yet will not take reliefe. Halfe dead, halfe liue, they gasping stand, disiesting this sower drench, Whilst water in their hands they haue, this fire yet will not quench. Bright mirrours of rare modestie, crown'd glory you haue wonne, That hauing time and place so fit, your passions did orecome. And now they fell to their repast, which was of sauadge Bore, Which Plaindor had in hunting slaine, with cheese and fruit good store. In steed of daintie wine full strong, to drinke glad were they than, The water of a riuer cleare, which from a Rocke forth ran. But their chiefe foode and daintiest meate, were louely glaunces cast, Which from their eyes like swiftest shafts, were shot and darted fast. A Sentence.Thrife blessed they; No fortune like, (although they feele some smart, ‘To such true Louers, as in bodies twaine, haue but one heart. ‘The wealth of all this hugie world, not worth the halfe of this, ‘None, (lest they haue experience had) can comprehend such blisse. ‘But as we see, the sunne oft times, through ouer sweltrie heate, Changing the weather faire, great stormes, and thundercraks doth threat; So likewise we do finde full oft, that of most pretious things Some great misfortune groweth, which vs to our destructions brings. For euery thing is framed so, and in such fashion'd guise, That what is good, here on the earth, doth finde his contraries. Of perfect Elements of diuers natures, here vnnam'de, Are bodies formde and fashioned, and liuing Creatures framde. The heate engendreth chillie cold, cold water, Thunders cracke, Warre, Concord, Concord Peace, &amp; Peace War, where all goeth to wracke. So, of the pleasant sweet successe, of Louers these, did come That which did breed their dismall ends, and layd them in their Tombe. The Shepheardesse, which Plaindor lou'd, disdaining in her minde, To be disdaind, and reape repulse, where she thought Loue to finde: Did dogge him as an enuious Spie, that no way he could walke, In wood, nor groue, but after him, full slylie she would stalke. And one day (by ill luck) it was, her fortune to espie, How (with Floretta) he a Caue did enter secretlie. Which, when she saw, her loue she curst, the author of her strife, She band the day of her sad byrth, detesting sore her life. She saw her labor all was lost, her time was spent in vaine, And therewithall she well perceiu'd, recurelesse was her paine. Yet, thought she, she would see the ende, of this their Loue so chast, And their discourse to heare, herselfe close in a bush, she plac't. Who, thinking they were (then) alone, for so they made account. Th'one toying with the other stood, as was their vsuall wont. And after many louely tricks, Loue from their eyes did thrill So many Darts, hitting their soules, more heate increasing still. That Plaindor, being ouerchaft with this fierce amorous rage, His lippes vpon the cheekes and mouth, of his faire Saint did gage. Now, of himselfe not master, he, her in his armes doth take, And thousand times did kisse her, though resistance she did make. As hard it is for him that dyeth through thyrst, and want of drinke, A Similie. For to abstaine, when he drawes nigh, the Cristall riuers brinke. So, t'is as insupportable, for any Louer much To be in presence of the Dame he loues, and her not touch. When he hath Fortune time, and place, the leisure and the meane, He cannot hold, his blood's so hot, his heate is so extreame. When he is neere his health, his health to haue, he needs must seeke, When he seeth what he longeth for, he needs the same must like. Flie were he senslesse as a stone, and liuelesse as a blocke, Like to a lumpe of heauie earth, and worse then flintie rocke. So Plaindor takes his pleasure then, forgetfull of his oth, Whilst he, her lips with kisses seales, respecting nought his troth. But weladay; those kisses sweet, to poyson sower did turne, And was the cause, that to his death, they forc't him for to mourne. Floretta chaft apace, that he, thus on her lips had seasde, But Plaindor, this her rage, at last, in sugred-wise appeasde. The sneaking Shepheardesse, the while, withdrawne her selfe now had Out from her hole, where she did see, what made her welnigh mad. And seeing that so many kisses twixt them giuen had bin, These Louers, lou'd but wantonlie, she strait begun to win. Away she goeth, nor far to see the ende she durst be bold, But much astonisht did depart, then frosty Ice more cold. She is resolu'd to be reueng'd, and vexed mightily, With sundry passions, her hote loue, doth turne to crueltie. The Loue of these two soules, she meanes to taxe with foule repriefe, And of the kissing close, to cast Floretta in the teeth. Her Honor to accuse, and of these vertuous Louers twaine To seeke with infamie, and with reproch, their liues to staine. O how disdaine is (in her kinde) more violent of force: And what great dammage hath it brought to men without remorse? O how it power hath for to change the hearts of vanquishers, And how to alter dearest Friends in minde, shee her bestirs. Meane-time Floretta vnderstands, that her Renoum's disgrac't, And that her Honor (vndeseru'd) is wrongfullie defac't. Her Fault, (if chaste loue may be term'de a Fault) this woman base One morning fore the Sheapheards all, reprocheth to her face. Which when Floretta heard, she vowes, ore-charg'de with furious Ire, Against her selfe, against her health, and life for to conspire. No longer will she liue (as now) reuenged for to bee, For Honor hers, by Treason stainde, as she with griefe doth see. An Example.So for to purge her selfe of fault, (not faultie) nerethelesse In ancient Time, vnto her Fame, did die the chaste Lucresse. Thus doth Floretta, destined too hard, with heauy looke, Sweare with her selfe, vpon her selfe, Murther to execute. Her daintie hands, she aymeth now, against her proper corse, Her hands, which too too hastie were, to wrong, without remorse. Ah, how much, Honor's deare vnto a chaste and modest spright, Who seeks by vice, to slaunder such, accursed be that Wight. A Sentence.The feare of Death can neuer coole Desire, that's resolet, To saue his good name, by his life, if he thereon be set. Floretta, then changing her former vse, from sweetest ioy, To vncoth plaint, and passions sad, surcharged with annoy. Bewailing her disaster hard, and sighing forth her paine, Vnto a sauadge Mountaines toppe, gets vp with speed amaine. Where sprang a certaine Water strange, or rather poyson fell, By which strong venim, she did meane, her woes for to expell. This water of such nature was, as nothing could it hold, It brake Glasse, Iron, Brasse, Leade, Steele, it was so deadly cold. But she that knew the propertie thereof, in hoofe of Asse, Close did the same conserue, and then away from thence did passe. And carrying it about her still (vntill she Plaindor found She neuer left, that done, she downe sits, by him on the ground. Where she withouten shewe of griefe, like Cignet that doth sing Before her death) these words worth Note did vse, thus greeting him. Ah Plaindor deare, deare may I say, if thy Floretta poore, Hath giuen thee any proofe of Loue, most perfect, or most sure; If euer of her friendship kinde, thou care hadst heretofore, As not long since, she in thy Loue, with pitty thee did store. By that same loyall loue of thine, she now coniureth thee, Permit her Honor, to reuenge her on her iniurie. Floretta (now) can liue no more, since that she, through thy selfe, Hath lost her good Fame, which she priz'de aboue all worldly wealth. Ah Plaindor, t'is (for euer) lost, and by like lucklesse Fate, Floretta thine, now goeth the way, her life to ruinate. Alas, how often told I thee, when first thou didst me woe, That still, mine Honor to preserue, thou shouldst respect haue due. Mine Honor, which Florettas life, after the same doth draw, And which I iustly forced am, to follow now by Law. How we do liue, here in this world, God knoweth is reckning small, A Sentence.Nor flourish can our Names, or deeds, immortally at all. Vnlesse our Honor, mongst our selues, doe liue immortallie, For that alone keeps vs aliue, that we can neuer die. But if the selfe same blood as yet, remaineth in thy heart Of such, so many sauadge beasts, by which thou richer art; If in the prime of thy best Age, and pride of thy youths flower, Thou hast not lost thy courage olde, through Loues ore-conquering power; Then Plaindor, I pray heartily, nay more, beseechen thee, To liue, when I am dead, and that thou wilt suruiuen me. And thinke deare Friend, I merit not the halfe part of the griefe Which for my death, I know that thou wilt take without reliefe. For I was, but a shadow plaine, trans-form'd in body thine, Besides, fairer then I, thee loues, whose beautie is diuine. Who, with affection like to thine, in fancie being set, The thought of me, and memorie, shall make thee soone forget. So that no sooner Death shall me, from my liues chaines dislinke, As thou stalt forced be, no more on me at all to thinke. Meane time, since hasty Death, doth me, of all my hopes depriue, To haue for my sore wound a Salue, whilst I shall be aliue; And that (sweet Shepheard) I no more (shall now) of thee haue need, Ile thee acquaint, how much, how deare, I loued thee indeed. Most zealous, yet more chast, I lou'd, such was mine amorous flame, My heart was thine, and in thy breast, mine owne Soule did remaine. My thoughts, did wholly run on thee, my bodie aye was thine, Thy will, as t'were, a penalt Lawe, to thee, did me combine. To please thee (not my selfe, (I liu'd, nor did I thinke at all, That ere my credit had receiu'd a foyle, much more a fall. Nay more, I could haue bene content, that thou shouldst tasted haue, That sweetest sweet, that Louers seeke, and still is, that they craue. But that mine Honor did ore me, with greater puissance seaze, Then my desire, ore senses had, (as sensuall) them to please. This selfe-same honor (now) although some (wrongfully) haue toucht, Because it too much honor'd thee, and suffered thee, too much. Demaunds, my bodie offered be, to him, my fault to purge, And for to haue it sacrifiz'de most bloodie, doth it vrge. And so it shall; Floretta, (then courage) take heart at grace, And this vile blot of hatefull shame, let's wipe from off our face. For though I through this poyson strong, of life depriued be, Yet my good Fame, taxt wrongfully, it shall restore to me. Adiew, my dearest Plaindor, but must I, my selfe absent From thee? and from thy presence, needs must I alack be sent? I, I; Ah, hellish griefe, yet me my heart againe restore, That I may liue below this earth, with quiet minde the more. Ah, render me; my heart againe, which Ile in pieces teare, Nor for to see the same to die, be thou abasht with feare. Sweete Plaindor, if that ere thou lou'dst Floretta, thou mayst vaunt, Vouchsafe this one request to her, (now dying) for to graunt, Which is, me to suruiue, that thou, as Testis, witnesse may, How wrongfully some thought (too much) my Glories pride to slay. I call thee, for to speake the truth, of my chaste Innocence, And to the Heauens I doe appeale, who knows my true pretence. Then (Friend) if euer in that sight of thine, this body haue Bene gratious, when it dead shall be, prouide for it, a graue. Close these mine eyes, cashirde from light; shut fast this mouth so pale, And this my Coarse, below in ground, to burie, do not faile. (Deare, this is all I craue of thee, since now my course is runne, That kindnes, is but worth small praise, that by the halues is done, But, how now Plaindor? what! do'st weepe? thou sigh'st amaine, me thinke, Nay, then thy grieuous Martyrdome, I soone will ease and stint. Lets dye, lets dye, more then high time t'is, I were gone from hence, And saying so, she swalloweth downe, that hatefull poysonous drench. That done, vppon the greeny grasse, her selfe she softly throwes. And holding of her armes acrosse, her prettie mouth doth close. When lifting vp her last seene eyes, she Plaindor might behold, How he his manly brest for griefe, did beate with courage bold. Whereat she weeps afresh, so great a Corsie to her t'is, And dying now, she striues to giue to him her latest kisse. That done, she yeeldeth vp the Ghost; Ah heauie spectakell, But now the dire Catastrophe, of this sad tale, Ile tell. When Plaindor saw his Mistres dead, with lookes most furious He draweth his sword, which gainst himselfe, he bends as barbarous. And raging like a bedlem mad, distraught of wit through wroth, Minding himselfe to massacre, these words he sigheth forth. Floretta, ah Floretta, speake, speake fairest of all Faire, Where's now thy faith, that did protest, of me to haue such care? Where's now thy oaths and promises? They (now) haue me deceiu'd, And my greene youth, long fed with hope, they haue of ioy bereau'd. Cruell Floretta, and yet cruell, to none, except vnto Thy selfe, when for anothers fault, thy selfe thou didst vndo. To bring me to my dismall ende no way couldst thou deuise, But for to slaughter thus thy selfe, in such a monstrous guise? O, faire, but chaster Coarse by farre, what hast thou done or sed, To be, vntimely, fore thy time, consorted with the dead? And thou pure soule, within that Coarse, what sinne didst thou commit, That thou so soone, from that faire Inne, away shouldst passe and flit? Thine Honor th'ast kept vndefil'd, then if you this, doe call A fault, how then hast thou offended? Else hast thou not at all. Faire beauties spotlesse Temple, thou doest dye for mine offence. And I, the essence of thy ill, to liue seeke to dispence. Ah wretched me, and which is worse, white liuered soppe I am, Vnworthie of such calling, as to beare thy Seruants name. No, no, I needs must dye, my blood, pardon, for fault shall win, And I will satisfaction make, for this my cruell sin. Yet fore I die, I humbly grace, and pardon, begge of thee, Who hast the power, that this my soule, remaineth thus in me. Ah pardon me, what ist I say? this pardon which I craue, Argues my fault, more monsterous, that worse I sinned haue. I see, the Murtherer I haue bin, of thy fresh flowring youth, Thy healths, chiefe Homicide, and foe, vnto thy faith some ruth. For me, (not for thy selfe) thou dyest, and shall I then be cause, To see those eyes &amp; mouth clos'd vp, which Death vnto them drawes? O, of all vertue, golden meane, of loyaltie, bright sonne, Whome as my Saint I haue ador'd, must thou for me be vndone? O hell, O black dispaire, of Starres most spitefull in such wise, To incense so many boysterous stormes, gainst my small barke to rise; Ay me, why dy'de I not, when first I saw this face of hern, Then lyke an exile, from all ioy to be exposde and driuen? But soft, my Toung runs too too fast, and words be nought but winde, I know not where I am, nor am I now in my right minde. Yet at the least, let me once bid my deerest Dame adieu, And let me of her take my leaue; Ah speake; what, will not you? No, no, I am vnworthy I, vnworthy of her grace, I not deserue, that haue destroyd such fauour, so faire face. And hast thou then, the heart to see, that beautie be disliu'de, The onely cause, that thou long since, of life wert not depriu'de? And canst thou breathe without her sight? thou canst not I doe know, Vnto Th'Elizian golden fieldes, thou needes with her must goe. My selfe, my young yeares cutting off, will rid me of annoy, Since such a blacke tempestious storme, hath shipwrackt all my ioy. Ile die, ile die; but yet what kind of death might I inuent Cruell enough for my vile fact; me iustly to torment? Since that the faithfulst maide aliue, through me her death hath found, To whome, more then to all the world, I was obligde and bound. Diuinest beautie, thou, through me, doest perish, and doest die, Whose chiefe delight was to restore, my nie lost libertie. Plaindor, thy deaths wound hath thee giuen, whilst he forgot himselfe, To whome he owed his life and goods, and more then all his wealth. Ah haplesse man, ah louely Nymphe, great reason sure thou hast To giue me ore, since ouer thee so small care I haue plac'te. And wisely didst thou gesse, that I vnto thy glorious fame, Should be small credit, rather one, that thee and thine should shame. But woe is me, thou wrongest me, if so of me thou iudge, Since for thy sake nought to attempt, as yet I ere did grudge. Faire, thou shalt know, that since my heart, a widower is through thee, He can no ioy what euer take, nor longer liuing bee. Much lesse, that I can like againe, I am no Louer such, If so thou thinkst, thou art deceiu'd, and wrongest me oremuch. Thy seruant, whilst I liu'd I was, dying ile be thy slaue, To make some mends for mine offence, thou readie me shalt haue, Ile die, as thou hast done, as one, of thy praise enuious, Because thou purchast hast for me, thy rest from sorrow thus. I will not beg, that I may touch, that prettie cherrie lip, Whilst I am dying, I confesse, my selfe deserue not it. Yet gratious Goddesse of my thoughs, if those thine eyes so bright, Haue not alreadie quite forsooke their wonted cheerfull light; Ah then, doe but once open them and Plaindor thine regard, With one small glaunce, who now doth leaue his life through fortune hard. Bright starres, your Plaindor, you shall see, how quickly he will die, If you so much doe grace him, as to ope but halfe an eye. And now in leiu of recompence, for wrong that done I haue, This blood accept, my hainous crime, to purifie and laue. Sweete Ladie now at last receiue this blood, this blood of mine, And suffer my dead coarse, repose and rest it selfe by thine. Thus said, with courage great, his sword, he thrusts into his side, And being dead vpon the ground, his bodie faint doth glide. Which with his lukewarme streaming blood, the ground did make to faile Of colour, whilst it flowing ranne, and dide it ouer all. Floretta all this while was not starke dead, the poyson strong Was not enough, which was the cause, her life it did prolong. Her he auie eyes she casteth vp, and rolleth here and there, Whilst in her face, a show of death, halfe smiling doth appeare. And seeing Plaindor, falne by her, she, him doth fast imbrace, And with her feeble force doth wipe, the blood from off his face. His head, with dying hand she doth hold vp, to ease his paine, And hauing giuen to him a kisse, rekisseth him againe. Wherewith he gaspeth, yet once more, and thinkes himselfe the most Blessed, that in his Mistris armes he yeeldeth vp his ghost. Thrise happie Plaindor, fortunate, eternall is thy glorie, For thou hast gained ouer death, a pretious victorie. Thou diest in the clasped armes, of faire Floretta thine, Whilst with her eyes, thine eyes, thy face with hers doe close conioyne. She striuing for to die, that she amaine might thee pursue, Whom thou doest see, though gainst her will, thee to suruiue so true. And now death had alreadie tane her speech, nor could she speake, Yet these few words she sighthed forth, with hollow voice most weake. O Plaindor, sweet friend, Shepheard mine, our Loues though miserable, To ages that hereafter come, to liue shall aie be able. Since through the vertuous paths they trod, vntainted chastitie Serues vnto them to be the ground, to their Eternitie. And though we now die, yet our selues, thus let vs comfort rife, Thou diest forme, and I for thee, am pleasde to end my life. Like faithfull friends we die, the one for th'other's well apaid, And in on: Tombe our bodies both shall be enterd and laid. Thou goest (my Loue) before me, and I follow thee most blithe, As fast, as fast I can, for, thee I meane not to suruiue. Yet happie we in dying thus since (kissing) we embrace, Which (liuing) we durst not attempt, for feare to haue disgrace. But now I come to thee; Thus said, she, on the face doth fall Of her blest Plaindor, whilst her soule, doth flit away withall. Their coarses be within one graue, where they doe quiet sleepe, And in this Rocke, vnto their fame, this verse was grauen deepe. ECCO Great Goddesse of these woods, that in these woods art honored right, Speake, wilt thou lend thine eares to one, that is in wofull plight? With thy last sweete sound amorous, wilt thou my griefe abate? Importuning my Fortune hard, to mee vnfortunate? O Goddesse answere my complaints, which I before thee powre, And pittie my outragious paine, by sweetning of my sowre. Comfort me in my torments and my griefes, that choketh mee, With hope that from this dismall plague; I one day may be free; To th'ende that I deuoutly may, blesse thy thrice blessed Grace, Ah, then if thou (as now) within these hollow Rocks hast place, Answere my Cryes: say, which of these two shall I prooue, To make an end of all my woes, or Death, or Loue? Ecco. LOVE. After so many crosses, which we force and driue, Shall I then die, or they being dead, shall I suruiue? Ecco. SVRVIVE. But, shall I still them liue, depriued of my pleasure? In pensiuenes thus languishing, and in displeasure. Ec. PLEASVRE. May it be, I should be grac't, with her, who doth excell, In all rare showes, so base as I, can I deserue so well? Ec. SO WELL. But, in meane space, for these my griefes, I haue no other scope, But death to ende them, since I liue without all hope. Ec. HOPE. Alas dispaire encountreth still, my rising hope, and truth, And ore me this proud power, will raigne and rage sans ruth. Ec. SANSRVTH. If so, thrice miserable, is the wretched Louers state, And mine what can it be, but most vnfortunate? Ec. FORTVNATE. After so many brunts, borne, which in my soule breedes strife, Which shall I call to helpe me then, or death, or life? Ec. LIFE. But if I vnder this hard law shall liue most cruelly, Who, then will pittie me, whilst in these panges I lie? Ecco. I. If so, then still ile hope, and O yee Gods I you adiure, Not to deceiue my future hopes, nor glories mine obscure. Ah, keepe your promise vnto me, and after so much griefe, Extinguish quite, the furie of my cares which beg reliefe. So will I blesse for euermore, your Deites most true, And mongst, the most renowm'd in world sing praises still of you. [Since, from my sad life, taken is my cleere light] Since, from my sad life, taken is my cleere light, What should I liue now, longer in this bad world? Faint hearts, their deaths waile, where the brauer courage Glad to their endes, runnes. What serues this light me, if what most mine eies pleased, Flies like a shadow, when I seeke the substance? LOVE, not the day, but that rare beautie seeketh Which makes him more shine. Starres, by their Influence, ioy and griefe doe bring vs, Whereas that beautie which our soules doth worship Is our sweet Mistris neuer working vs ill, But pleasure euer. Ah how I feele this paine for to torment me, Being depriu'd of this so worthy beautie, When that I found my libertie so deere, lost, And from me taken. Kept from thy faire sight, which my soule did nourish, Thinkst thou (sweet Ladie) that I longer can liue? Being but a picture, where thy beautie's painted For to please LOVES eye. Like to a pale coarse doe I seeme, in shape, now, Laid all along right, in a Tombe or Graue lowe, Whilst to my losse, I stray like him that wanders Darke in a Desart. Not any pleasure in the hugie Heauens, Can my misfortune, (nere so little) sweeten, Lost haue I her that was mine onely solace. Woe to me therefore. I without life doe liue, for that I want her, All that I haue, she seazeth on, as her owne. Now my Phisition I doe want, I needes must Be very sickly. In the respect of this so liuely hot flame, Which heretofore, hath burnt mine inward intrailes, Darke seemes the Sunne, so gloomie are my sad thoughts, Fit for dispairing. But if I long must liue, without her presence, Sweet death dspatch me, let me no more linger, For, far more blessed is the dead, then he that Wants his faire Mistris. [Before my selfe I doe disliue, heare these my plaints] Before my selfe I doe disliue, heare these my plaints O FAIRE, which rauisht hast my sweetest libertie, If thou before, hast dainde of my religious Loue; My loyaltie (after my death then honor thou. Nor feare that Heauens, shall by my death be proud, Because (ending my dayes) extinguisht is my Fire, Death onely can cashere mee from this wretched life, Where, in the sacred Throne of Loue seates my pure Soule, Whilst I doe breath, whilst hart, through 1000 sorrowes sore; It shall be seruile vassaile to thy Deitie. And, mongst the Ghosts (being dead) thou shalt my Lady be, For in my soule, thy Beautie is caractered; There do I see thee still, and as mine Idol chiefe Ile sacrifice to thee, great store of cries, and teares: Ah, then plight me thy faith, for to accept my vowes As late thou seemdst to rewe, at my sad heauie griefs, Leaue him to dye, to dye, who liues withouten life Being far from thine Eyes, his chiefe diuinest light. For say, (alas) wherein can I stand thee in steed, When I am but a shadow in a withered Corse? Spent haue I all my teares, bewailing thy long absence, In loosing thee, the Heauens haue reft my vigor quite; I nothing am become; Most wretched he that thinks To liue, depriu'd of that chiefe good his heart doth nourish. Then whilst I looke my fatall day of death to see. No voyce sounds in mine eares, but of laments and cries, Mirth is for those are fortunate, not for a soule That feeles more horrors strange then Limbos frightfull Ghosts, Then welcome pining Care, and sorrow sower to me, For with my thoughts, dispairing still, you best agree. [Beyond the Stigian Stix, hath Caron reft] Beyond the Stigian Stix, hath Caron reft Thee, O diuine Faith, and for company, Friendship with thee, who must not here be left, For faith is nothing without amitie. Alas, why let'st thy Muse liue in disdaine, To thee and her (a fortune vsuall seene,) Thou men beleeu'st, tis they that thee haue slaine, Abusing her through othes, as thou hast bin. Thy comforts this, thou diest at this hower, Her ende was languishing, long ere she dide, A speedie death is sweete, a lingring, sower: She starued died, by flowing plenties side. You Mortals then, let in one Tombe remaine, Faith, Loue, and Muses, since they were of prise: For, fond is he that calls them backe againe, And you not Loyall are, friendly, nor wise. [If in one coffin, FAITH, LOVE, and the MVSES graue] If in one coffin, FAITH, LOVE, and the MVSES graue, By earthly creatures hand, enformed close doe lie: And thinke their deedes and name, immortall so to haue, They doe abuse themselues, with ore much Surquedrie. If FAITH no more liues, and if (hence we banish LOVE, If MVSES, haue on earth, no sacred Altars here; Heauens then must (perish;) And the supreme Gods aboue With essence their's (diuine) confused must appeare: But heauens (as yet) stand firmely, Gods doe raigne, And mortall men, by liuing on the earth belowe, So FAITH, LOVE, and the MVSES, still aliue remaine, The sinnes of men cannot exile them vnto woe. A stormie Tempest, may the Sunne, sometimes obscure, Yet afterward, his Beames shew forth more bright and graue. [Mongst the cries of the dead, amidst sighes heauily groning ] Mongst the cries of the dead, amidst sighes heauily groning Of such Ghosts as are damn'd, frighted with Fiends and with hags, Long haue I forced forth, the accents of my too hoarse voice, Yet, nor the dead, nor the damn'd, answered haue any word, My cruell Mistris, nor the Heauens will vnderstand me, Ah solitarie wood, answere me then, I thee pray. Ah doe receiue, &amp; marke the wofull tune of my sad Song, And make all for to know, my clamor ore pittious. Draw with attractiue voyce the stony Rocks for to heare me, O grone, speake thou for me else, all, doe scorne at my cries; Thus for to sigh, and to complaine (alwaie') is a hard case: But worse it is for to see, who sighes, and cries, to be scorn'd. VVhat should I then, O yee woods, for Sacrifice to you offer, But my laments, to you, agreeable, and very fit? Since that you kindly daine, to answer vnto my waylings, Nought haue I now left else, only my sad toung I haue. But tis enough, too much, for such, as Cupid abuseth; For true Louers good hap, lies in the Tombes of the dead. Oh that (of woes wearie) some great God would but exchange me. Into some auncient Beech, or to some wilde sauadge Elme; Should not my liuelesse Trunke, be welcome th? to your Forrests! Teares should so fast from me fall, like to a cristall eye-spring. As they your faithfull plants still should make more abounding, And of power be to force, halfe dying trees to reuine; Ah most sacred Groues, (the time hath bin,) in your coole shade As one rauisht for ioy, I saw the heauenly face Of my cruell Faire; the deadliest foe to my good daies, Of which, since that the stars, as iealous haue me depriu'd, O giue me leaue (so much) as I may but write with my ?sharpe? knife Deepe all about your Rocks, the stories of my deare Loue. Then will I write, how heauens haue made daintily perfect, Mongst thousand beauties, Iuliet, more then the rest. I will write of her chast worth, more then rightly renowmed, What doe I say? Will I write? O, no, not I, as I should. Yet dare I write of my dire paines, the Destinie cruell, Write will I of my hopes, lookt for of me, but in vaine. I will tell how mine eyes are blind, with weeping I vse still And to death, will I leaue (deafe to my plaints, that hath bin A defying challenge, for to prooue that he could not Kill me, without that he kill my miseries therewithall. I will write, how my teares could moue no more with their weeping Those faire eies I adore, Eies, which I loue as my soule, Then the waues of sea doe moue the Rocks that doe scorne them: Rather, I write will, how into my teares there are falne Her leaden shafts, tipt hard with disdaine, for to coole them, And by the same, hath she power, me for to wound, when she please. Write will I, thi'll hap of my youth, the spring of my chiefe tide, Of such veniall faults, as by ill lucke we commit: Which when they seaze on vs, they ende our liues most intire: But more loud will I crie, that mine owne hurts and my harmes After so many crosses, nere could make me become wise, Curst is the wight that is plagu'd, yet by his plagues nothing wise. But yet (as, who power hath ore a power of the rest, He complaines without sense, that by a God's ore come. More for to striue, or doe then we can, the lawes doe forbid vs. LOVE ore Gods and Kings, Ile say I take but the vse, If the cause why I haue offended any doe aske me, Of great Gods and Kings, Ile say, I take but the vse. If to haue thus gron'd forth my painfull griefe I be blamed, If condemned I am, thus to bewray my true Loue; If I be taxt for my crying, for my plaints and my wailing, Then for my selfe, thus I say; Loue that doth wound euery man One himselfe being wounded, strait complains to his Mother, And Mars, oft did grieue, when that he first was in loue. Wretched (so that they iustly plaine) no man may forbid them Reason, t'haue to crie, till that each one doth them heare, Vnto the ende they may entreate all men for to helpe them; He that is sicke, yet scornes him that his paine can asswage, Nere can he cured be, lest that he seeke some meanes for his sicknes. Better tis to complaine, then like a foole for to die. Therefore my griefe, to you O Desarts haue I recounted, Which since you listned too, well will I wish vnto you. That gentle Zephirus, may calmely blow on your heads still, So will I pray for you, then for my sake doe the like. Pray that the cruell one, may take on me little pittie, So may you happie be: So may my Loue be as sweete. [Braue Phillis, tis not for to saue thy fame] Braue Phillis, tis not for to saue thy fame, About these woods thy portrature we cast: Who in the sisters of the woods liues, doth disdaine All pictures, for in them his name, shall last. Only the harmelesse good, most need and craue, The shadowes of the valiant sort to haue. Not for to shew thy beautie excellent, Thou art most (fairest Dame, drawne liuely here) But that all might behold thee still I ment, Since thou for rarest Thewes hast not thy peere. Glorie alone, must Iuliets rightest Painter bee, Honour her patterne, Vertue, her attire to see. [Accursed wretch, and shall my blubbered teares] Accursed wretch, and shall my blubbered teares Nere mollifie my Mystris flintie heart? O no, for these strange heats my bodie beares My teares to fire doe change, to breede my smart. Shall I no more behold her beautie bright, Which wonted was alone, me so to please? No, no, for now I liue withouten light, Since her I see not, cause of my disease. In double wise (alas) I finde my griefe, Whilst trebble still surmounteth my disgrace: First, cause I am a Thrall, without reliefe, And next, for that I see not her faire face. Thrise blest the dead, far happier then my selfe, Death makes an ende, of all their martyring paine: But I still toyling, keepe on sorrowes shelfe, Then, is my life, the worser of the twaine. Halfe dead, halfe liue, I languishing doe lie, Vnder the beautious eyes of my proud ?FAIRE?: Whilst I more cruell finde my destinie, Exilde from her, the essence of my care. Oh what colde passions in strange vncoth wise, Thy wofull absence breeds, through woes dispences? Since that thy sight, made smile my weeping eyes, The losse whereof, depriues me of my sences. DEARE, what am I? poore I, withouten thee? But like a coarse, quite void of vitall breath: Accursed Fate, that such a Law should bee, To force men liue, against their wills on earth. Of thousand griefes, the least and smallest crosse A Louer, louing, doth in Loue indure: Is worse by ods, then is of life the losse, Which we by gentle death, (our friend) procure. Compar'd vnto the passions which I feele, O happie Fate, that so would'st ende my life, To rid me of my troubles euery deele, A Cordiall wore, and comfort passing rife. What, shall I not, from these plagues be releasde? Neuer, before expir'd be my lifes date: Of blessings all, tis not, tis not the least, To die, whom Heauens, (whilsts that the liues) doth hate. O heauens, when will you gainst me quiet cease, And for a while take truce to doe me spight? No, no, I see with me you'l haue no peace, Yet vertue after stormes, doth shew most bright. You then doe meane, thus still my heart to racke, On tenters yours, to sound my constancie: But to what ende, doe you the same alacke, When I it know, and beare it patiently? Then cease yee Gods, to grieue me still with plagues, Ah whither carrie you my vexed soule? But tis no matter: shew your vtmost rage, Not you my dame alone, can it controule. As long as she to accept it please, in shewe You cannot hau't, nor for you shall it care: For dutie lesse, to heauens and Gods I owe, Then to my lifes sweet death, my cruell FAIRE. [Such one diuine Cassandra was] Such one diuine Cassandra was, The Pearle of Phrigian land: Her learning such, as it did passe, Whose Sire, it could not vnderstand. [Thus whilst the Louer burneth in this flame] Thus whilst the Louer burneth in this flame, No beautie's like to that of his faire dame. [But cruell fortune (in the end) did lie in waite] But cruell fortune (in the end) did lie in waite, Too soone so faire beginning for to ruinate. [Ladie (I parting) leaue with thee my soule] Ladie (I parting) leaue with thee my soule, Carrying with me nought but my captiue corse: My captiue corse, proud that you him controule, Through those faire darts, your eyes, Loues strongest, force Whilst I shall drawe, this aierie vitall breath, I still will keepe within me, this strange fire: Which in the fornace of my heart on earth My heart doth trie, my hopes to make more higher. My soule from death sweete Madame you doe keepe, That you may it restore to me againe: When at that heauenly harbor we shall meete, Where our chast Loues shall querdoned remaine: There shall I need it, for to make him tast, After so many troubles freede from griefe, That happie ioy, which Louers hearts makes wast Vntill thereof they find the right reliefe. Then (Soueraigne) pray we that some heauenly power, May hasten for our good, this blessed hower. [But O how short of mortall worldlings is the glorie] But O how short of mortall worldlings is the glorie: Her fortune is unconstant, and their liues but sorie. [But what more wauering did you euer find] But what more wauering did you euer find, Then Seaish waues, what more fierce or vnkind? [Thus when from Heauens of succour we dispaire] Thus when from Heauens of succour we dispaire, We finde that then they take for vs most care. [So faithfull Piramus with griefe was tost] So faithfull Piramus with griefe was tost, When he had thought his Thisbe faire was lost. [Now I haue lost the deare light of mine eyes] Now I haue lost the deare light of mine eyes, What should I doe, but end my wearie dayes? That Louer which with Mistris his doeth die, A Sentence. Dyeth not (Alas) but rather liues alwayes. So Pyramus and Thysbe, did disliue Themselues, and liu'd together like two Doues: That seruant which his Louer doth suruiue, No faithfull Louer by loyaltie prooues. So great a losse teares cannot counteruaile, The rate hereof at so high price is set: Base mindes it fittes (for life) to weepe and waile, That so at length their griefes they may forget. Not death it selfe though stung with his sharp sting, Their loyall hearts can parted make remaine: Th'one dying, doth death to the other bring, Making but one for to become of twaine. As sweet that happie life of Louers was, When th'one the other ioyfullie did prooue: So seemes it sweete to them from life to passe, When they together ende their Life and Loue. Loue doth renew, and so like Phœnix shall In the Elizian fieldes, below the earth: Chaste Amitie, not mortall t'is at all, As is our fatall ende, and flitting breath. Ah how can one liue in this world of woe, A Sentence. When he hath lost the best part of himselfe? Who seekes not after Mistris his to goe, In Friendships Checquer hath but little wealth. Diuorse me then from life yee Destinies, To rid me from this labyrinth of noy: The FAIREST shall not plaine in rightfull wise Of mee, since I haue lost her, (my chiefe ioy.) Ay mee, I see, Death no remorse will take On me, whilst slowe hee hearkneth to my crie: The Heauens, our plagues the greater for to make, Will not permit, Death should approach vs nie. Shall I then liue in griefe, my selfe to banne? Euen in despite, and gainst my soules owne will: Alas I must, for I vnworthy am To bee, where bides my Ladie, freed from ill. Am I not wretched then, more then the rest, To cause her death, for whom I ought t'haue dide? Then why should I imagine me so blest, As for to looke for comfort at this tide? No, no, I must (and I deserue to finde) Thousands of crosses, ere I ende this life: Who ill hath done, deserues no vsage kinde, No gentle death, but direfull sorrowes rife. A Sentence. My hope is this, that after thousand plagues, A lingring death shall seaze vpon my Coarse: Whilst thousand griefs throughout my vaines shall rage, The more to punish him without remorse. Then let none comfort, or once counsell mee, Since this my wound is mortall sans recure: [Meane time, these vertuous Louers twaine, did burne in one selfe fire] Meane time, these vertuous Louers twaine, did burne in one selfe fire, And languishing, did pine away, for want of their desire. [Thrise happie thought himselfe, to see that beautious face] Thrise happie thought himselfe, to see that beautious face, Although she had brought him into, so pittious a case. [O Death, which vnto death my griefes doest consecrate] O Death, which vnto death my griefes doest consecrate, For thankes, my heart blood I will offer vp to thee: Yet dying, I account my selfe as miserable, That sooner this to thee I had not power to proffer. Alas, what gaine I longer life for to prolong? If I am frighted thus as well by day as night? He shipwracke makes not of his rest, that gently dies, And his daies ending, makes an ende of all his griefes. O God, what doth it boote me to adore my FAIRE, Since I vnworthie am to serue so rare a beautie? And yet an honour great tis for me to be loyall, My hurts their guerdons haue in my fidelitie, Then must I die I see, and tis the common course Of brauest spirits, death (gently) to endure, Better resolue to die, then alwaies liue in woe, The shipman toyles, till he attaines the wished port. A due faire beautie, which my soule hast rauished, A due, mine eyes shall nere more see thy brightnes, pure, I will entombe with this my sad disastred life, My heart, my teares, my coarse, in my most faithfull Loue. Ay me, I waile too much, A minde magnanimous Distils not watrie drops, but floods of goarie blood, And worser is his fault, who doth vnwilling die, Then he that from this world doth part, with stomack braue, Courage then, thou my soule, leaue this sad sorrowes cell My bodie; and goe rise with those that liue below, Thrice blessed hee that dieth, his Mistris will to please, Such ende to make, not death, but Glories vnto him, For Countrey, Parents, Frends, their liues let others spend, I will bestow mine, for my faire and chastest Friend. [Hee force and courage takes, fresh blood comes in his face] Hee force and courage takes, fresh blood comes in his face, A similie. Nor findes he any paine, whilst shee is in that place. [Who then esteemes himselfe most blessed in his glorie] Who then esteemes himselfe most blessed in his glorie, More rich, then he had gainde a huge and great victorie. [Who filde, with goarie blood, and flaming fire faire Troy] Who filde, with goarie blood, and flaming fire faire Troy, Whilst as a wofull prey, the Grecians them did stroy. [For Hellen, so his force did Menelaus trie] For Hellen, so his force did Menelaus trie, Resolu'de her for to haue, or else with griefe to die. [As did Achilles once, and Hector valiant stout] As did Achilles once, and Hector valiant stout, When fore the walles of stately Troy, they fought it out. [So Paris (dastard-like) surprisde with seruile feare] So Paris (dastard-like) surprisde with seruile feare, Sware stout Achilles death, to whom he hate did beare. [What can the valiant Hercules, gainst oremuch force preuaile?] What can the valiant Hercules, gainst oremuch force preuaile? Couragious mindes will sooner die, then yeeld themselues, or quaile. [To Cleopatra so, Marke Anthonies dead coarse] To Cleopatra so, Marke Anthonies dead coarse Was brought, which she drew vp to her with wofull force. [Loue fare thou well, liue will I now] Loue fare thou well, liue will I now, Quiet amongst, the green-wood bow. Ill betide him that loue seekes, He shall liue, but with leane cheekes: He that fondly falles in loue, A slaue (still) to griefe shall prooue. Loue fare thou well, liue will I now, Quiet amongst the greene-wood bow. What an Asse, and foole is hee, That may serue, and will goe free: In worlds not a wench so faire, But I for my life more care. Loue fare thou well, liue will I now, Quiet amongst the &amp;c. I like not these Dames so smooth, As would haue men court and loue, For as constant I them finde, As the Sea is, or the winde. Loue fare thou well, liue &amp;c. Once I lou'd one that was kinde, But she did what pleasde her minde: Better tis nere to be borne, Then liue, as anothers scorne. Loue fare thou well, liue well, &amp;c. Then Loue, thee I doe defie, I hate thy bad dealing I, He is a foole that liues in paine, A toy so small for to gaine. Loue fare thou well, liue will I now, Quiet amongst the greene-wood bow. [Nor life, nor vertue haue I, lest I die] Nor life, nor vertue haue I, lest I die, I borrow of my buried trunke chiefe strength, Though I am dead, ore time yet triumph I, Ore time, that euerie thing consumes at length, Whats dead, disdained is, yet all affoord Me honour, and their chiefe preseruers name, All men may rightly call me their best Lord, Since they (Sans me) the world cannot maintaine, Yet though so much good doth from me proceed, These thanklesse worldlings doe not sticke at all To cut me off in Summer with great speed, And beate me into little powder small, Yet had I rather cruelly thus perish, Then liue a longer space, for many time The season doth but badly oft me chearish, Offering great hurt and wrong to vertue mine. The end of the first daies meeting of Iuliettaes Shepheards. THE SECOND DAIES MEETING, OF THE FIFT BOOKE OF IVLIETTAES SHEPHEARDS. [Cruell mishap, the Butcher of my life] Cruell mishap, the Butcher of my life, All (thee except) is mortall heere below: Men are deaths foes, &amp; with him, are at strife, And death is that which I doe couet so. My tongue speaks what with hart agreeth best, Death and laments, is of my speech the sourse: Ah iudge (then) if that I haue any rest, Louing (of euils all) the very worse. If damned soules withouten ende (alwaies) Sharp plagues endure; Alas, I feele like paine: A monstrous ill it is, all his lifes daies, To beare the brunt of ghosts in Limbo slaine: And yet the damnd, suffer for their offence, Whilst I (for doing good) indure these woes: The guiltie (to complaine of ill) wants sense, Wrongly to suffer, patience makes to lose: May not my plaints most iustly counted be, In right the Heauens of crueltie t'accuse? What good, ere found I, O yee Gods, (to me[illeg.] Vniust) yee slay vs, yet to heare vs yee refuse, Withouten feele, of pleasure or of ioy: With anguish you our vitall spirits fill, Enforcing vs to entertaine annoy. So what's good, leaues vs, whilst we take the ill, Thus gainst your fierce, and more then sharpe Alarms, Wee sickly soules, too weake, must harden strong Our selues, and for to helpe vs in our harmes, Wee hope in vaine, (the more) our selues to wrong. “Alack, Cowards that flie, and followed are ore fast, “Small leisure haue, or none, their Armour off to cast. [Loue, is a daintie force aboue all other] Loue, is a daintie force aboue all other, Which doth enforce our spirits vnto good things: And without it, our soules were neuer able Any thing to doe rightly, that deserueth Glorie for euer. Contraries, it doth bring into a concord, Bloodie warres, it (soone) swageth: (Being more puissant, then the Gods themselues are) Sweet, and the sower, it ioyneth both together, For to agree well. Vnder him (wholy) gouernd is the huge world, Vnder his lawes, the heauens eke are subiect: Rightly may he be termd a mightie Monarke, Whose power extends so far, as tis withouten Any set limit. He doth his might vse, onely exercising It, in the harts of litle pretie creatures, Flowers, plants, hearbes, and fruitfull springing greene trees, (Vnder his influence) like true hartie Louers, Loue one another. Of a brace of soules, he doth make but one soule, Which death it selfe doth hardly make to sunder, But man, doth perish, by his destny fatall: Therefore, is Loue, more kinder to be counted Then is our fortune. Simple mens fortunes, he doth (often) raise high, Making them, like to those, of greatest Princesse, Then doth not he (well) merrit much rewarding That to him submits, marching passing brauely Vnder his banner? Hope, to our fainting thoughts he bring to vs still, And to our hearts he bringeth ioy and gladnes, For vnto Louers nothing is so pleasant, As when they see, that of their louely Ladies Much they are made of. He doth reuiue our glory, that was extinct, Through the displeasure of our peruerse Plannets, Oh how the pleasure is accounted daintie, After laments, and bitter heauie sorrowes Which one endureth. After the brunt, of cruell raging Tempest, We find the skies more fairer then before time, Loue doth reforme vs, making vs become new, And to resist our mischiefes, he doth backe vs Fresh to encounter. Tis th'happie hauen, of our best assurance, The sacred Lodestar, Sailers vse in voyage, Whilst that his sweetnesse, all our former trauailes (Which we endured) in our tedious iourney, Makes vs forget them. A Sentence.Neuer hath he had taste aright of pleasure, That in the field hath neuer followed true Loue: As the darke night, is nothing to the faire day, So, to delights of Loue, ther's not vpon earth, Aught to be equalde. Euery ioy, must yeeld vnto daintie Loues ioy, Thoughts of all other, what are they but bitter? All chiefe contentment springeth from this kind Loue, For the conceit (oft) is so sweetly sugred, As all, it passeth. What we imagine of it, in our minds still Cannot be bettred, by our often wishing; For it doth (so much) please vs in our owne thoughts, As it reuiues vs, when our soule is passing Forth of our bodies. Then vnto Cupid, as a sacrifice fit, I, on his altar, offer will my poore heart, Nor is it disgrace for to honour rightly, One that is counted as a heauenly victor, Throughout the whole world. [Vaine Loue's, a furious burning force] Vaine Loue's, a furious burning force, That chastest winds burnes, sanus remorse: Wretched (that loueth) is that coarse, And want shall his desire: He hearts, and minds makes disagree, Through him great houses filled bee, With slaughters, treasons, treacherie; For he of strife is sire. Millions of men, he doth betray, The Gods he bringeth to his bay, Like subtill tyrant he doth slay, (Through sloth) all vertue rare, The smallest shrubs that grow so trim, Doe vade and wither thorough him, Poore beastes flie his imprisoning, Who liues he doth not spare. Such (as in Marriage) holily Are knit, which none ought to vntie, He seekes to lose most wickedly, Faith (plighted) to despite: Braue Kings and Princes he destroyes, Mightie and feeble, he annoyes, Whilst that, with proudest hearts he ioyes, To feed his appetite. The Louer oft as desperate, He egges to slay himselfe through hate, Better to be without Loues mate, Than die, and damned bee, If any pleasure he doth bring, (For that) he (double) doth vs sting, Loue cannot yeeld forth any thing, But what is sorrowes fee. To comfort vs, when storme is done, Then shines againe the cheerfull Sunne, Where, neuer ioy to Louers come, For they are shipwrackt still. A Sentence.Loue is of man the fatall Rocke, On which his ship of ease doth knocke, Whilst on the sands he doth him shocke, By death him for to spill: He neuer felt hath any paine, That hath not knowne the Louers vaine: Each griefe hath but his course certaine, Where Loue doth bleed for aye; No ill (so nigh) the heart doth sit, As doth this fierce tormenting fit, Death is more pleasing far than it, Which rids our cares away. Our soules with hope, it doth torment, Whilst nought, but Massacres are ment, To die tis better far content, Then (ay) liue languishing. Loue (then) most cruell, without grace, Whom I will curse in euery place; No God, but diuell is in this case, God, tha'utor's not of sinne. [LOVE, author of all euill, (the nurse of dainties delicate] LOVE, author of all euill, (the nurse of dainties delicate, The strange historie, and vvofull ende of proude Sycambra, and loyall Zerfira. That chuseth for to soiourne proude, in Pallaces of State: Who makes himselfe be honored, as Father of the skies, In Courts of mightiest Kings, and in the heauens, mongst Gods likewise. As yet scarce haunted had the Plaines, congeal'd with Ice and cold, Nor solitary Desarts strange, which snowy mountaines hold. He had but little in the Woods (yet) vsed for to be, Permitting Shepheards quietly, to ioy their libertie. Who, not so much (as thinking once, on him) had no more care, Then their small flocks forth for to leade, along the medowes faire. To watch, and to defend them, (arm'd) for armed still they were, From roaring Lyon, howling Wolfe, or from the rauenous Beare. Right happie is that man, that hath, then (this) no worser foe, The pleasant sweetnes of his life, to make him to forgoe. Happy indeed, if other thought, he hath not in this life, This trauaile being the cause of all content, and foe to strife. Withouten carke and care, they past their time deuoyd of feare, And from the Fatall sisters sheeres, exempt and freed they were. As iocund, and as merrily they liu'd, as day was long, No mestfull griefe was intermixt, their sweet discourse emong. Nor were their cheekes be blubbered (still) with teares continually, As wretched Louers, who bewaile their woes, with weeping eye. Withouten sighes, and sorrowes sad, they liu'd most blessed than, Nor they, their Fortunes did reuile, and as accursed ban. No pittious Tennor, such as this, their Songs or Chantings had, No mournfull note came heauily, forth from their brests ore-sad. As Louers vse, their Musique sweet, and merrie warbling voyce, Much like that of the Gods of Woods, that each thing doth reioyce. No enuious malice mongst them was, no poyson at their Table, No proud desire, the spring-tyde of their youth, made miserable. Exempt from all ambitious thoughts they were, whose mounting dart (Piercing into the minds of men) doth make them often smart. Nor any other passion strange had they, or did endure, Then such as did an earnest care, for their poore flocks procure. They thought they could resist Loues force, and oft did iest at him, Thinking he was not able, them vnder his yoake to bring. And as a stubborne Rock (we see) the Tempests rage doth scorne, Who growing angry at his pride, renues afresh his storme. Vntill, with flashy Lightning-claps, in pieces he doth breake His flintie stones, whilst to resist, his furie is too weake. And with a boysterous Whyrle-winds blast, on sudden casts downe all, So as being cleft in midst, it doth, in thousand pieces fall. Transporting (here and there) apart, by violence so burst, A Similie. And with the clap of Thunder-bolt, becommeth black as dust. Alongst the medowes and the fields, whilst they as trembling stand, To see how raging Tempests fell, ore euery thing commaund. Euen so, these Shepheards mockt at Loue, they scorn'd at his renowne, Who, chafing at them, (quickly) puld their Peacocks plumes adowne. Taking them prisoners in the snares, which they for others set, Whilst (idlely) they went to hunt, the light-foote Leueret. So long they gib'de at him, till at the last, they bought it deare, As did the Muses heretofore, when as they amorous were. And had him taken fettered fast, within a Flowrie line, He thinking them to haue embrac't, through his great power diuine. For Cupid in meane time, as one enuious of their glorie, Thinking the fairer that he tooke, the more his victorie. Resolu'd to vanquish them, and in his yoake to make them draw, And force them prooue (against their wills) the rigor of his law. He at an ynch doeth follow them, watching most warily, As doeth the Hunts-man when his game (the wilde Boore) he doth spie. When they were set along the bankes, of some cleare running brooke. Or on some little Hillock small, or Oake for shade had tooke. Or whilst (like Fairies) they sat downe, about some siluer spring, Some working, and some doing one, and some, another thing. Some, tuning their Rebeccas rude, and some their Cornets shrill, Each one, themselues applying to what sport they had most will. Whilst in the thickest of the grasse, and meadowes coloured greene, Their prettie foolish Flocks to daunce to feede, and bleat, were seene. Meane time, LOVE watch't with wary heed, aduantage for to take, To spoyle their pleasures sweet, and them his prisoners for to make. But he did find that this could not vpon the hast be done, A Sentence.To vanquish such as prudent be, is not effected soone. This Fort of Vertue to assault, he could not find the feate, Sore doubting, lest in skirmishing, he should (repulst) be beate. Not easily can Loue surprise, the double fenced brest Of such a one, who for his Loue, of vertue is possest. A Sentence.Where (through preuention graue) he knew, he no good there could finde, Whilst, mongst chast harts, his force was like, a little blast of winde. In th'end, when long he had attempt (although it was in vaine) He playeth the subtile Spie, with craft, his purpose to obtaine. Thrusting himselfe in middest of, this chast and harmles flocke, As doth the Wolfe, when he doth meane, the silly Lambes to mocke. Dauncing within the eyes most faire, of fairest Shepheardesse, To make himselfe be honored there, with lowly humblenesse. There doth he take his lodging vp, this practise for to prooue, And rauisheth thousands of harts (most chast) with her sweet Loue. Meane while, vnto the Shepheards all, this Shepheardesse doth seeme So faire a Creature, as her face, immortall they do deeme. They, her adore within their soules, and loue her perfectly, They seek to serue her, honoring her with zeale, religiously. But she makes no account of them, she thinks her selfe diuine, Whilst mortall men, for her to loue, she scorns, as t'were a crime. Thus Loue, with pride, such minds doth fill, as with such heat is firde, And who, with such disdainfull spirits, most hauty are inspirde. A Sentence.So (oft) fine coyest Dames, most proud, and insolent become, When, men they'le haue to account of them, &amp; yet mens sights will shun. Euen as that Souldier, who doth back returne to natiue soyle As victor, not a little vaunts, and bragges of golden spoyle. A ComparisonSo with vain-glory, small is not, this angell possest, Whose insolencie is such, as Heauens themselues the same detest. Honor, oft-times, engendred is, of the most perfects thing, Each one belieues his owne conceit, (his passion following) Accounts of what is excellent, within his proper soule, But yet such faults as him disgrace, he neuer doth controule. A Sentence.He seeth the goodliest gifts he hath, to be distaind with pride, Yet on this vice so palpable, to looke he cannot bide. This Shepheardesse, Sycambra proud, was call'd, and christned so, Whose high aspiring, wrought (in th'end) her finall ouerthrow. A faire young Shepheard did her loue (her) did he loue alone, But at her hands (poore silly soule) contentment found he none. For though she knew affection his, did towards her surmount, Yet she, not of his friendship waide, nor of him made no count. Too too diuine, she thought her selfe, for any for to loue, Loues selfe, (so high she lookt) her will could hardly change or moue. Yet, by the selfe-same Loue, her pride was punisht to her cost, And this presumptuous minde of hers, was cause her life she lost. For now behold, LOVE (who to'th Gods) for might yeelds not at all, (Brauely) to tame proud stubborne hearts, that pride might haue a fall. Beyond, this loftie minded Girle doth soare, the prize to haue. Whilst to a heart more proud then hers, he makes her stoope, like slaue. This was a Springall young, who of his youth was in the prime, Sanguin, as Adon, faire, as faire Narcissus, in his time. As trim, and fresh as May, whose chiefe delight and exercise, Was hunting of the rauenous Wolfe, as was his vsuall guise. The poysoned darts of restles Loue, which loyall hearts doth slay, His wonted rest, brake not at all, by night, nor yet by day. He neuer dream'd of, nor ere knew, what those sad waylings meane. Which gripes the Louers oft with griefs, and makes them pale &amp; leane. He carefull, looking to his sheepe, his time away did passe, In hunting was his chiefest ioy, his loue, wet fishing was. Thus doe you see, how Loue reueng'd himselfe, on that coye Dame, Who ore-presumptuous, both his grace and fauour did disdaine. Thus, hurbe hurlie makes he, being the sire of leaud debate, Confounds all orders good, and sense, and changeth our estate. So braue Achilles lou'd, yet could not lou'd be of his friend, So did Apollo, Daphne like, but tw'as vnto no end. So thousands loued haue, who nere could right rewarded be, Whilst they true tryall made of Loues most vniust crueltie. A Sentence. Sycambra, she (whom others lik'te) did loue, sans being lou'd, And seeking others to transforme, herselfe transformde she proou'd. The louely Swaine which she adorde, Armanda, (cleped so,) Armanda, whom Sycambra sought, yet nere could find him tho. Of stature he was tall, well made of personage and face, And in discretion bare himselfe, with trim and seemely grace. His chestnut haire, was like vnto the whitish waters wet, Which dangling downe in tresses faire, did waue alongst his necke. His faultlesse for-head large and broad, as outward witnes gaue, By secret instinct (as it were) of his stout courage braue. His eyes in colour like to blacke, with twinckling eye-browes hid, The swift flight which from bowe doth flie, resemble aptly did. His Currall mouth was Rubie red, like to the ruddy rose, When through the heat of Sunne, himselfe he daintily doth close. His cheeks, white as the Creame, wherein red strawberies one flings; His Gate and port, like to the state Maiesticall of kings. His naked chinne, declar'd his youth, on which no haire was yet, His well-growne armes, his valour stout: his speech, his prudent wit. By this same gentle Shepheard, was Sycambras pride tooke downe, Since (carelesse of her care for him) he on her still did frowne. Cruell he was without remorse, vnto her endlesse paine, As she vnto her Louer was, retchlesse and hard againe. His great disdaine, this crueltie made her to feele the more, Which (through his beautie, ouer-proud) he made her suffer sore. Thus, oft by selfe-same punishment, which we doe others make To feele, for our offences bad, like penance we doe take. A Sentence. So (oft) the Heauens, by selfe-same Blade, to slay our proper Coarse, (With which we others slaughtered haue) doe iustly vs inforce. Now whilst this Shepheardesse did burne, infancie, with vnease, Nothing, (vnlesse Armanda t'was) her eyes bewitcht, could please. Yet nothing did Armanda loath so much, as when he spide Sycambra, hatefull to his sight, for then, for spite he dide. Thus, their desires (quite contrarie) the one vnto the other, Could not but bring forth thousand griefs, which they were forc't to smother. Sycambra curst that haplesse Loue, which made her for to burne, For him, who vnto her againe, like Loue did not returne. And contrarie, that she must hate the Amitie so rare, Which Zerphir, Zerphir, Louer hers, most loyall to her bare. For so that gentle Swaine was call'd, whose friendship was not fainde, And who, for honoring her so much, much sorrow had sustainde. Meane space, Sycambra night and day, laments her Fortunes hard, Accusing her crosse Fate, and Loue, from all good luck debard. Whilst all this while, Armanda blythe, his hunting followeth fast, And chasing of the Hart and Hynde, his time with pleasure past. He sleepeth soundly in the night, withouten dread or feare, Whilst amorous (onely) of his health, himselfe he seeks to cleare. But weladay, the other Swayne, poore Zerphir, Zerphir poore, As did Sycambra, so did he, most grieuous paines endure. As well as she Armanda lou'd, he lou'd her, or as much, Whilst with the flame of selfe-samefire, Loue his true hart did touch. Yet could he not this uncoth flame, extinguish, coole, or quench, Loue, so from ease and remedy, did keepe him as a fence. Sycambras griefe, and Zerphires paine, alike were in like case, Whilst from their blubbered eyes, salt teares ran trickling downe apace. Both wounded with like Loue, and yet with diuers sundry darts, Encreasing more their dolours, and their pangs within their harts. Sycambra nere Armanda could, attaine as oft she sought, Nor to affect Zerphir, her Swaine, she euer could be brought. Most wretched her hard happe, to place Loue, where she reapt disdaine, Withouten any remedy, for to asswage her paine. Nor to haue power to succour him, who was her Louer true, Whom she did force (yet could not chuse) through her disdaine to rue. Thus many dayes, in this estate, these strange desires remaind, Whilst neither length of time, nor woes, their Fortunes euer chang'd. Sycambra louing still the man, that would not her requite, Nor she once smiling on her Swayne, whose ioy was in her sight. But in the end, vnable more this choaking rage to smother, She did resolue, at resolute, her toments to discouer. To trie if she Armanda could, perswade to ease her smart, And if a gainfull purchase she could make, of his deare hart. For one day (as his fashion was) as he was on the wayes, Attending on his flocke of sheepe, which wantonly did grase, Not thinking he of any Loue, (detesting such a foe) Deuising thousand toyes himselfe to please, as he did goe. Sycambra sweetly him accosts, and prayeth him doe her grace, To giue her leaue, her Fortunes hard, she may discourse a space. And not her prayers to disdaine, nor yet her secret vow, Nor crueller then Gods to be, who vnto prayers bow. Vouchsafing mortall men to heare, and them not to despise, But mou'd vnto compassion, heale their wounds in pittious wise. These words Armanda galled much, (who nought for her did passe) Yet she so vrg'de him, as to heare her speake, content he was. She then as one amazde in minde, quite out of countenance, Her vitall spirits bereft of hope, her ioyes for to aduance. A cold swet ouer all her face, quaking with frightfulnesse, Her eyes halfe shut for shame, her heart fraughted with much distresse. Her sences, daunted sore, her breath still panting too and fro, All which, as true fore-runners, did her griefs at hand fore-show. Her tongue stuttring, &amp; stammering thick, her voyce trembling &amp; soft, Now weeping, and then sobbing fast, and sighing then full oft. See thus to him (vnkinde) did speake at last, though (first) t'were long, To him who pleasure small did take, in this her wofull Song. Ah my Armanda, wilt not take on me compassion? Nor of these torments which doe vexe me, in this vncoth fashion? Wilt thou her send most cruelly, vnto her fatall Tombe? Her, who in soule hath vow'de thine owne, alone for to become? Hast thou the heart, the wight that liues, onely for thee to slay? To th'end shee might thee dutious serue, and chastly thee obey? Sweet Shepheard, euery labour great, deserues a recompence, And (lesse men iustly deale) the Heauens with them will not dispence. They must respect vnto them giue, and awfull honor chiefe, A Sentence. They must their Louers loue, and seek to swage their inward griefe. Else are they not so curteous as is the Lyonesse, Who sheweth to him that feedeth her, a kind of thankefulnesse. Ah then regard my pittious plaintes, reward me for my paine, And suffer me to ioy thy loue, which I deserue to gaine. After a long laborious toyle, the Husbandman doeth reape, The wisht for fruit, which Haruest doth with plentie on him heape. Whereby hee well is guerdoned, for moyling so before, Forgetting quite all former care, which troubled him full sore. And wilt thou I, that partie be, afflicted with such crosse? That I alone, shall merite none receiue, for all my losse? That I shall alwayes liue in Dole, in sad lamenting still, Nor finde no ease for all my griefes, is this thy pleasures will? Wilt thou be without pardon sweete, and mercie all alone, Like to a Furie full of hate, wilt thou be such a one? Ah sweete Armanda, (hart too faire) so cruell for to bee, Beautie and Mercie, as two Twinnes, together still agree. A Sentence. Euen as the Iuye with his armes, the wall doeth close embrace, Winding himselfe most hard thereto: So Beautie cleanes to Grace. And wilt thou then by Bedlem rage, thy Beautie rare defame? Wilt thou through thy strange crueltie; purchase a Murtherers name? Wilt thou (ore-come with ore-much spite) force her vnwilling die? Who thee adoreth as the Gods aboue, most reuerently? Alack Armanda, doe not so, thy Vertue so to wrong, Wise men, themselues so carrie, as (they after death) liue long. A Sentence. Wee must not haue respect alone vnto the present thing, But hope that future praise, great ease vnto our soules may bring. Ah then (deare Shepheard) mercie showe to mee, which shall redowne, To thy immortall Glory much, and much to thy renowne. Be thou content to see her breathe, who by thy Grace doth liue: And who to view thy hurts, in soule (more then thy selfe) would grieue, No Treasure like a faithfull Friend, so rich you can deuise, Who to himselfe gets foes, in minde, much discontented dies. Friendship from Heauen first come, and as a gift diuine is held, A Sentence. And mortall men from ouerthrowes, it saued hath not seld. Then (Deare) vouchsafe for to appease the torments I endure, Appease my sorrowes, and my wounds (nigh mortall) daine to cure. Nor force me not, lest dying, I (when life from me shall part) Doe call vpon thee in my death, as if chiefe cause thou wert. Ah speake then (my Delight) and cleare from me this bitter storme, By comforting my deadly woes, which I too long haue borne. To th'end thy kindnesse milde, to helpe my sicknesse may be seene, As hitherto, the Author of my troubles thou hast beene. But why doest thou so long delay to answere vnto mee? Hard harted more then flintie rocks, which in the mountains bee. Ah cruellman, I well perceiue, my loue thou doest disdaine, Nor wilt vouchsafe in cheerfull wise, to staunch my bleeding vaine. I see thou meanst with those thine eyes, prides dartes, still me to pierce, To close me in my fatall Tombe, through rigor thine, so fierce. Well, be it so, I am content; For happie I them gesse, A Sentence.Who dying, see to dye with them, their griefes, which then doe cease. And since I finde that sauadge-like, thou wilt not rue my state, I am well pleasde to end my dayes, because thou doest me hate. Then (yet but daine to speake to me) say, if thou wilt asswage, Or still increase these plagues of mine, which doe within me rage? (Cruell, dispatch my loyaltie, which nere from thee did swerue) Say in thy conscience, doeth it not, one word of thee deserue? A Sentence.Alas, answere, but I, or no, what lesse thing can one finde, Or baser priz'de, then is a word, which is but sound of winde? Thus said, she sighing ceast, whilst teares from cheekes, like showres did fall, Yet, nor her selfe, nor teares, nor speech, Armanda mou'd at all. Nay more, so cruell was he growne, as he disdaind to looke Vpon her face, her beautious face, which hardly he could brooke. Her passionate words, could not perswade, they made him hate her more, That he so long had giuen her eare, himselfe he blamed sore. In th'end, forc't by the vrgings oft, and importunitie Of sad Sicambra, who like Ghost, did haunt him with her crie. With furious lookes, and frowning brow, these words at last he spoke, Which (like a dismall Oracle) her heart in sunder broke. Foolish Sicambra, (thus in vaine) to vexe me, what doest moane? From these fond fittes of idle Loue: thy minde, why doest not weane? T'is thou, that makst Armanda die, in worse then wofull wise, Armanda, who thy speech and loue contemnes, as worthlesse prise. Thy tedious tale, told to no end, to heare, he little ioyes, He dies, tormented, tir'de, and gaul'd, to heare thee make such noyse. Now prie thee, prie thee, let alone Armanda miserable, Who for to take his wonted rest, is not through thee scarce able. He at thy follies doeth but smile; his chiefe delight and loue, Is for to chase wild beasts of prey, his strength gainst them to prooue. He cannot like of any thing, except his flocke of sheepe, With which, (to pleasure his, not small) he in the fields doth keepe. To force one loue against his will, is, what can neuer be, Neuer the same hath bene as yet nor shall you find't in me. For loyall Loue, that it may dure, and neuer prooue to faint, A sentence.Doth of himselfe, seaze on the heart, without force or constraint. Where being forc't, t'is alwayes bad, vnperfect and vnsound, For nothing's goodly, but what's built, on Friendships firmest ground. Then why, fond Gyrle, art thou so mad, to loue, me to constraine? By this thy earnest vrging speech, which thou too well canst faine? I tell thee, I in those false eyes, nor face of thine, delight, Nor doe I pittie ought at all, thy hard and beauty plight, I laugh to see thee (heauie) weepe, to heare thee sigh, I smile: And in thy martyring, much do ioy, whilst thou complainst the while. Poore wretch, thou doest but loose thy time; nor euer shalt thou finde, Armanda will his fancie change, to thee for to be kinde. He'le neuer loue thee; For before his heart should so conspire To quench so worthlesse flames, a death most strange he would desire. For neuer greater mischiefe vile, can any, himselfe bring, Then when he tries the laws of Loue, and feeles his poysonous sting. Vnhappie they that know the same, and wise I him account, That with this bedlem passion mad, will not at all confrount. My yeares are too too young, mine age not ripe enough as yet, My selfe to subiect as a slaue, to Loue his furious fit. Nor haue I time enough, to be a scholler in his schoole, And I am wilde enough, although I play not so the foole. Then leaue me to my selfe, that I may of my selfe dispose, Whose pleasure, hunting is, whose sport, is quiet soft repose. And come not thus to trouble me, with these thy bawling cries, Which I assure thee, I disdaine, in most contemptuous wise. Be gone, nor looke (here) any more, thou come this text to preach, For, for such sicknesse as these, I am no pleasing leach. And therewithall the Shepheard sterne departs, and all alone Sicambra leanes vncomforted, Sanus pittying of her mone. Alacke, what should she doe as now? She could doe nought but waile, Which rather did encrease her griefe, then cause the same to quaile. No teares our passions can represse, which from the heart arise, A signe they are of woe, but want the perfect remedie. It is but lost time to lament, whil'st weeping we reuiue Afresh, these cruell torments which doe martire vs aliue. Now as she wofully thus tooke on, in this her desperate plight, Kinde Zerphir, who had sought her much, on her by chance did light And seeing her afflicted thus, all desolate and sole, He (sighing) weepes, to view her weepe, and with her doth condole. So suffereth the Louer chast, for his sweet Ladies sake, If she but grieued be, the same he at his soule doth take. He of the paine participates, which in her minde is growne, And more her hurt doth trouble him, then that which is his owne. Zerphir then, did endure as much, as did the Shepheardesse, Her teares were his, his pensiue plight, then his was nothing lesse. But after much lamentings sad, with many a bitter sob, He sweetly thus gan comfort her, whil'st fast her heart did throb. Sicambra, who (thus miserable) thy life hath made to me? Who hath thy fortune brought as mine, thus pittious for to be? Whence comes these sighes, true witnesses of thine in internall troubles? Whence flow these teares apparant showes, that care within thee double, Ist possible a wight, to find so cruell in his will To worke, or once in minde to thinke so faire a Virgin ill. What heart so harsh, degenerate, can liue here on the ground, That to so rare a beautious face, he dare a foe be found? The all doing Gods, whose Essence is immortall and diuine, Haue heretofore sought fauours out, lesse faire a thousand time. Phœbus, of not so faire as thou, did dearely like and deeme, And Ioue, inferiours thine by far, did fancie and esteeme. Who then hard hearted so could be, to play so vile a part, As for to seeke to trouble thee, who more then Goddesse art? Neuer was yet diuinitie to be offended seene, But for their rash temeritie, it hath well punisht beene. Then Lady speake, who could ecclips thy Sun-shine glorie thus Or ore thy feature faire, who could become so tyrannous? The hearts of many Shepheards proud, hast not thou vanquished? Thy diamond eyes, their haughtie spirits, haue they not rauished? Then why should'st thou thus mourne, and weepe? Ah cease to keepe this guile, And from thy heart, all dismall care, abandon and exile. Too louely is thy countenance, thy coarse too sweete to see, That in the flower of youth, thou should'st withouten Louers bee: Mong'st which, thy loyall Zerphir still, most dutious thou shalt finde, And who more then his proper good, thy seruice aie doth minde. Whil'st on the Altar of goodwill, his heart in zealous wise, Vnto thy Saint-like beautie he, (deuout) doth sacrifice. Ah, if thou wert acquainted with this heate so vehement, With which Loue doth incense vs so, whil'st he doth vs torment; If thou but knew'st this ill, by which such crosses sower we haue. Nere leaning vs, vntill our coarse, it bringeth to the graue; Or if thou canst imagine by thine owne experience, How much they suffer, whom Loue keepes within his warlike fence: Then by the selfesame bitter panges, which tortor thy sad heart, Doe take some pittie on my woes, and rue my deadly smart. If thou desir'st to haue thy wound to be recur'd with ease, To heale mine inward festring sore, let it not thee displease. Chase hence mine ill, drie vp my teares, and by one selfesame way, Driue thine likewise from hence, which else will soone worke my decay, Liue after Zerphir thy true slaue, withouten teene and care, Happie liue thou Sicambra sweet, in beautie, euer rare. Passe cheerfully thy time with him, who merily would liue, If he might see these ioylesse fits, thou ouer once would'st giue. (Deare) let me holde this life of mine, as tennant vnto thee, That freede from all disasters bad, thy heart he mighten see. Helpe thou thy selfe (Physition sweet) and driue away these fits, These fits, companions vnto griefe, which in thy countinance fits. And bring not him vnluckilie, before his time be come, (Who is thy secret seruant sworne) vnto his dismall Tombe. Ah speake to me mine onely ioy, and wipe thy watrie eyes, (Of late the clearest lightes of heauen) they were not made for cries. Giue to my frighted heart some breath, and yeeld to him such scope, That (one day) he of that his ill, may be acquit through hope. Put him in comfort, that (though now his fortunes in the waine) He may once finde it at the full, and franchisde be againe. But why Sicambra speak'st thou not? And why art thou so sad? This humour thine melancolie, doth make me almost mad. Ah answere me, and by thy paine, what I doe suffer iudge, Being ore loyall vnto thee, at which I doe not grudge. The parly portall of thy mouth, at last yet open breake, Still hold me not thus in suspence, but somewhat to me speake. For to importune thee with words, I neuer meane to leaue, Vntill some happie blest repile, I shall from thee receaue. Speake, then at last, that my poore heart may know if it shall cease From doubtfull dread, or if thou meanst to graunt it wished peace. Thus Zerphir woo'd, but she that had her minde (as then) not there, No answere to him gaue againe, nor what he said, did heare. She not so much as thought on him, nor what he had indur'd For her owne sake, (Loue all her thoughts so strongly had immurde) Yet he so earnest was with her, desiring her to show, What her intention was towards him, whereby he might it know. That in the end with choller mou'd (outragious through griefe,) Her passions ruling ouer her, and desprate of reliefe; With pale and wanny looke, she forth to him these words doth send, The heauie sentence of his death, and of his fatall end. What moues thee (Zerphir) vnto her so troublesome to bee, Who cares not for thee, nor accounts of thy griefe, nor thee? Who through her dismall fortune hard, hath so much for to care, As other mens misfortunes, she (to heare) no time hath spare. Say what I haue to doe with thee, or with thy constancie. When I nere meane to goe about to quit this courtesie? Thou nothing feel'st compar'd to me, my griefe to thine is small, Thy sicknes in respect of mine, no sicknes is at all. To helpe thy maladie, I am too much diseasde in minde, To chase away thy cares, mine owne troubles too great I finde. A sickly Patient sore attatch't with sharpe diseases rife, Vnto another soule diseasde, cannot restore him life. I cannot helpe thee, for, for want of succour I my selfe, Complaine withouten remedie, yet cannot I finde health. With selfesame paine, as thou art, I am vexed through Loue, Nor Fortune, me to fauour more then thee, as yet I proue. Seeke then elsewhere to swage thy woes, mongst such as (so) are bent, And suffer me that I alone my sorrowes may lament. Nor me importune any more, for fore I pittie take Of thee, the Sunne shall leaue the skie, and firie coach forsake. Enough tis, I alreadie burne, with more then extreame paine, Withouten entertaining more, a second worser gaine. It neuer shall be said or seene, Sycambra burnes with fire Of nouell change, as if to rage, she had a swift desire. For she, vnkind Armanda still, will loue and euer shall, Nor euer any but himselfe in heart she will enstall. She death will chuse, before her faith, she once doe falsifie, Though churlish her, he (Sanus remorse) doth vse discourteously. Thy seruice nere of me shall finde reward or recompence, Then get thee gone, goe Shepheard goe, dispatch I say from hence. Thus said, she angrie flings away (in minde tormented sore,) As scarred wolfe, from thickest flies, or foming sauadge Boore. When they doe heare the Eccoing woods, with noyce of Hounds to ring, Which of their taking (as their prey,) vnluckie message bring. So went Sycambra, who did leaue poore Zerphir in a sound, Whilst banning his hard fortunes all, he grunting falls on ground. He stood amazde, Enon like, and as a Bedlem mad, When as (how Paris false had her forsooke) she tidings had. He hauing lost his Mistris, loathes to liue, such life to rew, As Piramus, for Thisbies sake, himselfe vnhappie slew. The Nymph, he followeth heauily (who galde was at the hart,) As th'Iron doth the Adamant, so drawes she him to smart. Whilst metamorphisde into teares of woe, he knoweth no meane, His torments being so cruell, as his griefes are too extreame. He thinkes no more of his poore sheepe, he hath forgotten those; No other thought now troubles him, but how to end his woes. His voyce, his crie, his gesture sad, and his most morunfull speech, Are all of Loue, and how they Loue for succour may beseech, His colour now is chang'd, and gate, so is his wonted grace, No red nor white as heretofore, remaineth in his face. Like ashes he lookes pale and leane, whilst sorrow drieth his bones, Nor hath he strength for to doe aught, except to send forth grones. Without all hope, or comfort, he doth draw his loathed life, And for his refuge, death doth seeke, to rid him of this strife. But death, is deafe vnto his call, as fierce Sycambra is, And therefore thou, and th'other too, he gainst his will must misse. Well may he call, but they'le not come (once) comfort for to bring, But leaue him, when he needes them most, to liue thus languishing. In briefe, the heauens, death, and men, with destnies doe conspire, Gainst him, that he shall burne, yet haue no meane to quench this fire. Nothing preuailes him to auaile, whilst on the other side Sycambra, in like predicament as he is, doth abide. Of thousand bloodie passions she participateth, vext, Yet nothing can relieue her, whilst she languisheth perplext. Armanda, iests, and her, when she doth speake, at euery word He skoffes, nor fauour he at all to her will once afford. He laughes to see her weepe, to heare her sigh, it makes him smile, Nor will so much as one small dram of pittie yeeld the while. But growing too too insolent, and puffed vp with pride, He wills her to depart and die, nor cannot her abide. Swearing by all the Gods, that he will sooner seeke his death, Then fancie her, as long as he shall draw his vitall breath. She, seeing her selfe disdained thus, doth ban her destinie, And after many strange conceits, resolueth for to die By some strange kinde of vncoth death, she meanes to cure her wound, Which Loue (as foe) had giuen her, her sences to confound. Without imploring any more, sauadge Armandas aide; Who neither her, nor her kinde sute, respected aught or waide. So loyall Hero, of her life, an end would willing make, When faire Leander she did see drowned for her sake. Ah fretting corsie worse then death, with neuer endles smart, When cheating Loue impoysoneth, the constant loyall heart. More cruell then the rest by odds for dying, we but range From this life to another, while we make a better change. Whereas the forlorne Louers life, so bitter is and fell, As thousand deaths they chuse before, they will abide the hell. Of all the torments then on th'earth, Loue most outragious is, Loue, that our youths makes wither fast, depriuing vs of blisse. Sycambra therefore now resolu'de, to die doth soone entend, That so at length her Agonies, and senselesse griefes may end. A trenchant blade she taketh vp, but viewing it so bright And sharpe, she straitway lets it fall, so much it her doth fright. Her heart will not endure her hand should set it to her brest, And therefore with such inchauntment, to die she doth detest. A throtling halter doth displease, as much as sword before, So rusty to be strangled stiffe, her faire necke doth abore. She poyson takes, but her conceit that drench hath ouerthrowne, Which makes her, halter, poyson, sword, (all three) to let alone. A gentler kinde of death (though strange) she hath found out as tho, Which is, t'entombd her selfe aliue, to rid her of her woe. She meanes within a Rocke obscure, from other Rockes far wide, With thousand Ditches compassed, and bushes on each side. Fearefull to Sauadge beasts themselues, and horrible to men, Her selfe there to enclose, and there her selfe doth closely pen. Thus lanquisht she most wrethedly, no meate she had, nor bred. But sighes and sobs, no drinke at all, but teares which fast she shed. No meate she would, but mone, no drinke, but dole to end her life, Meaning hereby her coarse to spoyle, through starning famines knife. The skriching night Owles dolefully, her wailings did assist, And lucklesse Rauens moand her Loue, whilst they to her did list. Death, whom she wisht for (oft) at hand was still, though not so nigh As she desirde, and sorrow was with her continually. No voyce she vsde but cries, no speech, but drerie drie laments, So heauily she mournes, as Rockes for pittie doe relent. Yet no man answeres her at all; The comfort most she findes, Is when false Ecco, her last word againe vnto her windes. But he that of her miserie, is cause and motiue chiefe, Is deafe vnto her praiers become, nor yeeld will her reliefe. More hard, then stubborne Rocks, then hills more Sauadge and more fierce, He will not mollifie his heart, no pittie can it pierce. His weale it is to see her waile, her bale, to him is blisse, Whilst in a state most pittilesse, far worse then death he is. O Tygers whelpe, monster of men, worthy of any blame, Too much vnworthy to be lou'd of such a constant dame. Ah may that fortune chaunce to thee, as to Adonis coy, Who (of a Goddesse dayning loue) a Boore did him destroy. And let it hap to thee, as to Narcissus peeuish Elfe, Who (others Loues refusing) did, in loue fall with himselfe. Yet can I not say, that the Gods are partiall, but most iust, The selfesame measure, others we doe giue, we looke for must. So (Ladies) had Sycambra, kinde vnto her Zerphir bene, She had not (then) such tortors felt, nor had abid such teene As she did bide, still languishing, desirous for to die, Whilst she to death (Armanda like) to come to her doth crie. Yet hopes she thus, she cannot liue, and that her times not long, Her heart she findes alreadie broke, for bearing so great wrong. Besides, her fainting bodie fraile, prognosticates to her, (By reason nature's growne so weake) death is not from her far. Much doe the gastly dreames she hath in slumber, her affright, And fearefull apparitions strange, which she beholdes in night. Sometimes they to her bring dispare, then her with hope they feede, With hope in vaine, which when she wakes, her wounds more fresh make bleed. For he that nothing hath to loose, needs not to waile his losse, Nor needs he feare that Fortunes wheeles (swift turning) should him crosse. Where, he is in most pittious plight, that viewes his chiefest stay, (Which should from ruine him support) on sudden tooke away. Long time Sycambra in this wise most vncoth liued thus, Like to the shape of gastly death, in case most dolorous. Whilst in meane space, Famine and Griefe, with neuer ceasing cries, Her flesh did turne to bones, her heart tormenting in strange guise. Her colour which before was fresh, and daintie as the Rose, And that same beautious varnish pure, no more (now) in her showes. Like to the Flower, which trodden downe within the Medowe greene, By hastie foote of trampling steed, or plodding Oxe is seene. Such one this dying Shephardesse did seeme, quite changde and faint, Her quondam louely face, the teares with blubbring, foule did taint. Her faire eyes, darke and heauie shewd, as when the skies we see, With thickned storme of winde and raine, ore shadowed for to bee. Those shooting Glaunces, which of late were in her rolling Spheares, (Controllers in Dan Cupids Court) no more as now appeares. No more as Diamonds glister they, nor Sun-like doe they shine, But looke like Phœbus, when his place to night he doth resigne. And (now) death which did heretofore long linger, comes apace, And gently seemes by many signes, her offer to embrace. Her forhead faire, whose verie frowne, of all did fauour winne, Was now become deepe furrowed, with sharpe and wrinkled skinne. Her sallow visage, pale and thin, and hunger-staru'd did seeme, One of th'infernall hellish hagges, for shape you would her deeme. Her brests, too pretious Iuerie mounts, were fallen Lanke and bare, Her body (that rich shop) had lost her wonted pretious ware. Her feeble armes, and shoulders weake, supporters of her coarse, Were nought but ioynts of skin and bone, withouten strength and force. So short and thicke she drew her breath, sighing so deepe and sore, As one might easilie gesse she was, not far off from deaths dore. And had not bene but for her teares, which on her cheekes she shed, You would haue iudgd, she had not bene aliue, but stonie dead. Had she not throbs and sighes sent forth, from fainting brest like storme, That all her sences had bene past, you would haue vowd and sworne. Ah too too haplesse Louers chaunce, like her no wretches such, So Dido dide, the Troyan Duke, for louing ouer much. Enon so for Paris died, so, Hero for her friend, (When him she could not saue from death) her life did willing end. Meane while Zerphir, most haplesse wight, on whom fortune did frowne, This dying Shepheardesse echewhere, doth search for vp and downe. And as we oftentimes the Hart, with furious raging moode, Doe see to seeke (his mate) the Hinde with eger pace in wood. (Who is retir'd alone for nonce) into some priuate way, Or running through the forrests wilde, wandring (perchance a stray.) He scales the matchlesse mountaine tops, the hugie hilles most bold, And then he rangeth longst the bankes, of streaming waters cold. Now, through the thickest quickesedge thicke, he venters far to goe, And (now) the Caues he visiteth in hollow dales below. So Zerphir (franticke like) doth runne, to seeke that beautie, which Did (long before) vnto his paine forespeake him and bewitch. One while, he wandereth by the Sea, the sandie shore along, An other while, he skales high hills (through Loue enforst so strong) And then, againe, most desperately, with courage he doth creepe, And diueth into the bottomes lowe, of rockie Caues most deepe. He scoures the vallies, and the plaine, through medowes he doth runne. Gainst Gods and man, he murmureth, as one thats quite vndonne. He calls Sycambra, still, the same Sycambra he doth sound, Whilst Ecco, pittying him, againe Sycambra backe doth bound. In th'end so long he searcheth, that at last he findes her out, When now his voyce was almost lost, with hollowing all about. A Ghost he findes, no living coarse, her haire about her eare, Which blustring blasts of froward windes, abroad dispearst did beare. Her brow, did pale and earthly show, whose colour naturall, Death chased had away as now, and ceazed ouer all. Her ebbone eyes were dull and dimme, suncke deepely in her head, Ore whom the Fatall sisters three, too much tyrannized. Her bloodlesse lippes, like ashes showde, her sweet alluring lip, From which a iuyce did come, which Loue (being ill at ease) did sip. Those Cherries, Roses, Rubies, which you once might there haue spide, Were vanished, and in their steed, worse colours were descride. No fauour was within her face, no cheerfulnes of looke, For some dead coarse, not liuing wight, you might her then haue tooke. This heauie sight and spectacle, did stop his fainting breath, And forct, his inward powers to be as cold as any earth. Withouten mouing, he did stand, and seemd to be one Of those which fierce Medusa chaung'd into a worthlesse stone. But lucklesse she (the Touchstone true of Loue) to trie all wrongs, Who onely to bewaile her griefes, exceedingly still longs, Perceiu'd him not, when first he came appearing to her nigh, Whilst with her passions she partakes, which makes her peece-meale die. Which when the Shepheard throughly vewed, awakt from out his sound, He wondred, that for very woe, he died not on that ground. He draweth neerer vnto her, yet loth to offend the faire, And though her fault he blames, yet he not to reproach her dare. Vpon the sudden, backe he startes, and from her doth recoyle, And then with stealing pace, returnes to her another while. Nor for his life dares he to speake; For where Loue loyall is, There no respect nor due regard at any time doth misse. He seeth how she doth sigh and sob, and how she teares doth shed, Apparant signes and witnesses, that (yet) she is not dead. This makes him sigh and sob (as she) and weepe with pittious dinne, Yet all this pittious stir could not (once) moue her looke on him. So much the wretch was rauished, and earnest in conceit, About resignement of her life, which sorrow did her threat. Whilst, she doth leane her aking-head, vpon her hand belowe, Giuing scalding teares, passage into her panting brest to flowe. Teares, that not quencht, but did encrease the flames that burnt her heart, Teares, that euen to her inward soule did pearce, like glauncing dart. In th'end, the Shepheard cloyd with noy, with griefe hardned and bolde, In pittious voyce and low, to her his mind did thus vnfolde. Woe is me Sycambra is it thou, I see so miserable, And, haue I liude (so long) to view, a sight so lamentable? Ist thou whom death by vncoth Fate, and Fortune ouer strange, Doth force vntimelesse thus into thy darkesome Tombe to range? Ist thou, which nothing hast but teares and cries to entertaine The sharpe assault of death, the which thou couetest ore faine? Ist thou, I see to runne vnto thy end ore desperate, By cruell Planets hatefull doome, to ill, predestinate? Ist thou Sycambra, whom thy Fates, and fatall Destinie, As iealous of thy praise, thy daies to shorten doe agree? Ist thou that hast that colour faire no more vpon thy face, Which as the colour of my griefes, in heart I did embrace? Ist thou that hast no more those flames, within thine eyes now dead, Through which before with brightest fire my soule was daily fed? Ist thou, that hast no more that shew, of more then beautie rare, The prison of my libertie, the cause of all my care? Ist thou, ist thou, whom partiall Gods inforce vnwilling me, Of thy departure from this life, a witnesse for to be? This thou, I know, but too too well, whose perfect Picture right, Is too too liuely portraide forth, within mine inward spright. Tis thou, I know, but too too well, though changd, thou art the same, I, for Sycambra thee will know, thou still shalt be my dame. Tis thou, tis thou, that diest with sobs and sighes tormented thus, Whilst blest thou thinkst thy selfe, to leaue a life so dolorous Tis thou, that parting from this world, this wold is naked left, And voyd of pleasure and delight, which with thee is bereft. Woe is me, and must these eyes, (yet no eyes, but streames of brine,) Liue for to see eclipsed to be, so faire a Sun-shine? Whose glittring Lampes, my chiefest light of yore were wont to bee, Without whose glances bright, nor day, nor morning I could see? Alas (my God) why was I not, when that I first was borne, Transformd into some stone, then thus to be false Cupids scorne? Why died I not, before the time in loue with thee I fell? Since thy plagues vndeserude, doe proue my soule a Criminell? Why doe I not miscarrie, but (against my will) thus liue, Through force of this so vniust Lawe, the more my soule to grieue? Which forceth her to die, that doth deserue to liue for aie, Whilst wretched me, who merrit death, it will not take away? Ah too too partiall lawlesse law, of miserable Loue, Accursed be that day, wherein thou first this life didst proue. O Gods, dart downe your thunderbolts, vpon my hatefull head, Plague me, not her, tis I, not she, that should be punished. This trunke of mine vnprofitable, of vitall breath bereaue, Since that mischieuous Loue doth me, in my best loue deceiue. Ding downe to hell, this coarse of mine, this wicked periur'd corse, (Consuming it to powder small) by flashing lightnings force. Kill (Zerphir) kill, that by one death, he end may all his woe, And with the same rid all his plagues, that in him daily growe. But (fairest Faire) must thou needs die? O losse inestimable, No, no, thou canst not die, for death to kill thee is not able. Thy glory, mongst both Gods and men, shall neuer haue an end, (Despite of Destny) Vertue this, from Tombe shall still defend. Within the hearts of liuing men, shall be thy lasting graue, And as another Pallas thou, shalt reuerence of them haue. Thy soule hath heretofore too rich, and royall tired beene, Thy beautie eke too sacred, and thy Faith too constant seene. Then (as base seruile Bond-slaues poore, tide vnto Vassalage) Subiect to be, or homage yeeld, to deaths ore hastie rage. No (louely Ladie) thou shalt liue, and Zerphir he shall die, Because he came not as he should, to helpe thee speedily. Zerphir must die, who by his death (a true certificate) Shall shew, how through the want of thee, that he to liue doth hate. Zerphir must die, because he cannot after thee suruiue, Nor without thy sweet companie, delight to be aliue. Zerphir must die, because depriude he is, of thy sweet face, And therefore meanes by selfesame steps, the selfesame path to trace. Yet my soules ioy, if of my griefe, if truth that nere did swarue, The smallest sparke of fauour left, did ere of thee deserue. If my deare blood, to beautie thine, which willing I afford, (As sacrifice for to be shed) merrits of thee one word, Ah then looke vpon Zerphir thine, these sighes and sobs refraine, And fore he dieth, vouchsafe to speake to him a word or twaine. This is the onely boone I craue, to which, (but) condiscend, And most contented then, below to th'other Ghosts ile wend. But I perceiues thou wilt not grant this sute (cruell) to me, I cannot this small grace obtaine, I finde it will not be. Why then lets brauely hence depart, lets die her face before, And lets before her seeke to gaine, the calme Elizian shore. So saying, he full oft (farewell Sycambra) did rehearce, Which done, his sword he plact against his brest, the same to pearce. When as Sycambra wakt, as t'were from forth her passions sad, To see Zerphir arriued there by her, was much adrad. But more she troubled was, when she perceu'd how in that place, He as one desperate, would haue slaine himselfe before her face. This forced her pittiously to looke towards him, and with her hand To make a signe, as though she would graunt what he did demand. Beckning to him, to throw his blade from him, which he ore bolde Had drawne to sley himselfe, whilst she her meaning would vnfolde. To which the Shepheard willing greede, approaching to her nie, Longing to heare what she would say, resolude with her to die. He comforts her, he cheareth her, he praieth her leaue her mone, Whilst she with much adoe these words, (her last will) forth doth grone. Zerphir, if I haue iniurde thee, (as needs I must confesse) Yet more reuenge, then what is light on me, thou needs not presse. If heretofore my beautie proud, hath (oft) abused thee, The heauens, to punish that foule fault, thou now dost (iustly) see. I feele, (and that but rightfully) the very selfesame griefe, That thou endur'st to liue disdaind (daining) Sanus reliefe. I die (Zerphir) I die in paine, because as thou I loue, Then with my death contented be, since I this penance proue. Now, I coniure thee, if thou feelst the tortors and the plagues Allotted vnto Louers true, which neuer cease to rage. If thou dost know that dainfull power, of Cupids matchlesse force, (Which makes vs often count of such, as yeeld vs no remorse. And such as much doe make of vs (as barborous and vngrate) To scorne their sutes, and for their Loue, them to repaie with hate. Then (Zerphir) pardon I beseech, since I haue made thee smart, Thou seest, (although not by thy meanes) enough reuengde thou art. That eye which once did thee contemne, with ouer-haughtie scorne, Death to requite thy wrongs on it, and vpon me, hath sworne. Sycambra dieth, plungd in woe, and none doth her deplore, Her countenance and complexion both, are chaunged ouer sore. Her face is bloodlesse, and heate doth keepe within her vaines, Her armes are branne falne, in her cheekes no colour now remaines. She dyeth, she dieth, desirous more to die, then for to liue, Onely that thee she could not helpe nor succour, she doth grieue. Ah Zerphir, if to thinke on me, no anguish thee twill bring, If for thy ouer cruell Dame, it moues thee any thing. And if that Loue (of late so hot,) be not as yet growne colde, But as a valiant conquerour, thy heart doth prisoner holde. If (yet) affection thou bearst her, who neuer thee affected, And that all pittie thou hast not (from pittying her) reiected; Then humblie I doe thee beseech, by that rare former Loue, That these thy griefes, right bottomlesse, compassion kinde may moue. And that this thy compassion sweet, for me may (so) preuaile, As thou to graunt one sute to her, vouchsafe not for to faile. And this it is I beg of thee, that after th'Iron sleepe Of death shall cease vpon my coarse, possession there to keepe, When thou my coarse depriued quite of beauties gifts shalt view, My chearfull eyes to loose their lights, and bid those lights adue, When thou doest heere her sigh from forth her soule (vntimely crost,) And when thou shalt Sycambra thine, view to giue vp the Ghost, Ah then, goe this good turne for me, doe this for me straitway, Vnto my cruell vnkind friend, this RING from me conuay. Tell him, his too too flintie heart, and barborous crueltie, Hath forct me (loyalst maide aliue) for him (aliue) to die. Tell him, by that quicke lightning fire, which from his eyes forth came, Which swifter far then whirling darts, my gentle heart haue slaine. By his rich beautie, too too rich for me, too poore to enioy, Which, for my time, vntimely brought, me vnto endlesse noy. And by that heart of his, too proud, tryumphing ore my glorie, That he forget me not, but thinke vpon my pittious storie. Doe this, sweet Zerphir, for my sake, doe this request for mee. Tis all before my death to thee I giue, as Legasee. Nor doe denie me this, although in conscience I confesse, I, not deserue thy smallest grace, for my ere cruelnesse. Ah Zerphir, this denie me not; This said, she held her peace, And presently death fore her came, with violence to cease. Whilst with a gentle quiet sigh, her soule that wearie was Of loathed life, most willing vp vnto the heauens did passe. Leauing her bodie voyd of life, withouten vitall aire, Disrobde of beautie, spoylde of forme, depriude of colour faire. Yet happie she, to die in such kinde sort as (then) she dide, Since that her griefe vanisht therewith, (which liuing she did bide. Happie to die (so) as she dide, since partiall Loue vniust, Disasters hard, and vndeserude, vpon her still did thrust. Like as we see in th'end of day, vpon the set of Sunne, When Tethis entertaines her spouse, (the light being well night done,) A kinde of cloudie sable dampe ariseth to our eyes, And with a gloomie curtaine thicke, is couered all the skies. So as vpon the face of th'earth, there nothing doth appeare, But darknesse, sleepe, and heauie care, with gastly sighes each where. So by degrees this beautious coarse, lookt pale and wanne like earth, When (once) the soule, had it depriude of his quicke liuing breath. Like to a shadow was it, of a substance faire before, No cheerfull colour was there in that face, so faire of yore. Withouten sence or motion, it remained like a blöcke, Or as a comly pile of stone, carude out of marble Rocke. Yet Zirphir doth imbrace it oft, (and as ift twere aliue, The same with pittious glaunces, he to yeeld to him doth striue. But kisse her, he not dares, though she be dead, lest he offend The soule of her, who (whilst she liu'd,) he lou'd as dearest friend. Her (as before) he doth respect, and doth her reuerence, Although him no drop of grace she gaue, his amorous heate to quench. Teares like to flowers he streameth downe, yet not one word he speakes, Sorrow so much doth seaze on him, as tongue from plaining breakes. Long was he in this agonie, at length he comes his way, Taking the Fatall Ring with him, his Mistris to obey. He hunteth vp and downe to finde Armanda, and at last, (Reuiling him) into these tearmes (tearmes fit for him) he brast. Hard hearted, cruell, Sauadge wretch, for thy vnworthy Loue, Fairest Sycambra, now is dead, since thee, she could not moue. Dead is she, for thy sake, thou liu'st, vnworthy of thy life, Thou liu'dst, her, and her loue to scorne, through thy orethwartings rise, Take here this Ring, she sends to thee, as witnesse too too true, That she destroyd her selfe for thee, though thou her death nought rue. The Flower of all fairenes is dead, slaine onely for thy sake, Whilst thou, nor her, nor on her Loue, wouldst any pittie take. More fierce then Tyger, beastly more then Lion, when as such Relent, and shew compassion more, then thou hast done, by much. Why takst thou not this pretious Iem thou that doest women kill, Which, for thee, till her dying day, she had reserued still. Happie to haue so deare a pawne, yet curst, because thou art The cause, the owner kinde thereof, was strooke with mortall dart. Hold, hold, rude carle, and thinke not but the day shall one day come, When as iust plague thou shalt receiue, for this, by heauens iust dome. Armanda, hearing him to rage in this wise, nought doth say, But smiling, flings the Ring from him, to the woods betakes his way. Leauing poore Zerphir, almost quite bereft of wit, and mad, To see what slight regard of her, and of her Ring he had. And, but he feard the quiet Ghost to grieue, of his faire Dame, He had Armanda for his pride, as he deserued, slaine. This held his hands from slaughtring him, he (so) did her respect, The onely reason why to kill, that wretch he did neglect. The reuerence which vnto her, he (long before time) bare, Made him for his so hot reuenge, his hastie will to spare. As one enraged, this carelesse man he looketh after long, And by his eyes, his minde bewraies, he faine would venge this wrong. Nor doth he leaue to curse and ban, this more then ruthlesse wight, Vntill, through thicknes of the trees, no more he spie him might. Wherewith he riseth, and turnes backe, vnto his Ladies corse, Which he embracing oft, through griefe to fall in sound doth force. Her Ring, on finger hers againe he puts, nor dareth hee Retaine the same, as his owne goods, although now dead she bee. Fearing Sycambras angrie Ghost, once fairest ouer all, Should be offended for so doing, and him disloyall call. This causde him beare himselfe so iust, whilst in most mournfull wise, These his last wordes he sighed forth, mixt with strange dolefull cries. And is it thou Sycambra sweet, whom now I doe embrace, Whom whilst thou liu'dst, my chiefest ioy I in this earth did place? Is thy faire body, fram'd by heauens, all others for to foyle, Become deaths prey, vnworthy, death Sycambra sweet should spoyle? Are these the eyes, whose lights of late, did shine like brightest Sunne, Now darkned by dire destinie, and of their sights vndone? Is this faire forhead, honour chiefe, of Muses vertuous, Bereft of beautious feature quite, and quite disfigurde thus? Is this sweet hony mouth of thine, O griefe that makes me banne, Dispoylde of all his treasures rich, become pale, white and wanne? Are thy chast Brests, the pure ripe fruit of Paradise so faire, Which to allure, the staiedst witts, two daintie Apples bare? Dead and shrunke in, and thou thy selfe, Sycambra tirde with griefe, Hast thou thy soule to heauens resignde, there for to finde reliefe? Thou hast alas, nor liu'dst thou more, those eyes of thine, but late Like Diamonds sparkes, now dim doe show, as deaths darke Sable gate. Nor part nor parcell is of thee, from head vnto the foote, But yeelds a heauie solemne shew, attirde in deadly sute. Thy dates expirde dead art thou now, led, hast thou me the way, High time, now tis for me, the lawes of Nature to obey. Reason it is I follow thee, for is it possible, Thou being gone, I longer here vpon this earth can dwell? My wretched daies in this vile world haue bene vnfortunate, Yet dying thus in chastest Loue, most happie is my state. The Stars haue fullie recompenst, my hatefull fortunes here, In graunting me, the libertie, to die by thee, my deare. And that I touch that coarse, by death exempt from vitall sence, Which, when it liu'd, full hardly did my seruice recompence. Ah beautious shade, of late the lodge of honour and fresh Bower, Whose praise, deaths selfe, though he thee slew, to kill hath not the power. Faire coarse, receiue these tribute teares, and let me pardon winne, If thee embracing after death, I ouerbold haue beene. Daine to accept my scalding sighes, and doe not him despise, Who whilst he liu'd, honoured thee, and dying, thee doth prise. Rich coarse, thou art to make amends to me (poore soule) in this, That for so many woes I felt, thou yeeld to me one kisse. For, what haue I for all my paines, and trauaile I endurde, Which thy hard heart continually too willing me procurde? What recompence or pardon due, did euer I receiue, But what (through sorrow) my best rest from me did take and reaue. To cancell all which former counts, be pleasde (faire Loue) I pray, That Zerphir dying (thou being dead) kisse thee (now) chastly may. And yet alas I dare not, lest that thou shouldst take it ill Gainst me, as if I sought the same withouten thy good will. Faire shadow, now with glorie dect, take for my offerings These teares, these sighes, these passions sad, which sorrow to thee brings. Receiue this blood I sprinkle here, vpon thy sacred shrine, To th'end, my soule in dutious sort, may follow after thine. My heart was thine whilst I did liue, and fortune wills it so That it be thine, when Zerphirs dead, and lieth in th'earth full low. Daine therefore (sacred soule) and thinke not little proud am I, That tis my chaunce, I may haue leaue by thy sweet side to lie. Willing thou wert not whilst thou liu'dst, that I should be thine owne, But being dead, I for thy slaue, most loyall shall be knowne. By reason I haue well deseru'd, through griefes (long by me) borne, And by my chastest countenance, that neuer woes did scorne. The memorie whereof, me thinkes, should make thee, sometimes call To minde thy Zerphir, and not quite forget him once for all. But Zerphir (now) lets die; too long we staied haue, tis enough, Sufficient teares on this dead coarse, we now haue powred forth. The heauens are wearied with my cries, and neuer ceaselesse plaint, And my broke heart, through trembling feare, doth beate in bulcke and faint. Lets die by this one word and as he spoken had that word, (Most cruell gainst himselfe) his side he pierceth with his sword. Wherewith, he tumbleth dead, vpon his Mistris breathlesse corse, Whilst that his wound, both soule and blood, to issue forth doth force. Thus died Sycambra, meriting for constancie great fame, Thus Zerphir died, deseruing well, to haue a liuing name. Death, ioynd them both together neere, their bodies in one Tombe Were laid, which liuing were disioynd by ouer partiall Dome. And (not long after) that proud youth, Armanda for his pride, (As well he aid deserue the same) full dearely did abide. For presently vpon their death, like to Narcissus fond, He died (in loue, being with himselfe) whose losse not any monde. Thus Cupid's in his Lawes, vniust, as by this Tale you see, Yet (Ladies) learne to loue, if lou'd (againe) you meane to bee. SONNET. I. [My thoughts, a new cleare Sunne, (now) whollie do adore] My thoughts, a new cleare Sunne, (now) whollie do adore, My hart (pale, through great feare) doth march vnder his light: This Sunne, thy sweete Face is, where beautie keepes his store, Which being diuine, diuinely prized is aright. Sacred Diana, worshipped in Heauen and Hell, Thou, ore my hart (alone) deseru'st to signorise, Men vanquisht, by rare Deities, that do excell, Thee taking (so) should honor in most sacred wise. If then (I) by thine eyes, am ouercome and slaine, Yet I esteeme my selfe, most happie so to be: Men (seruing Gods) Cannonized Saints, are for their paine, Ah then, these humble prayers, and vowes, accept of me. The greatest Gods vouchsafe, ment presents for to take, A Sentence.And meaning good (the sacrifice) most perfect still doth make. SONNET. II. [Faire Dame, which with sweet bonds, in bondage holdst my hart] Faire Dame, which with sweet bonds, in bondage holdst my hart, Daine, that he may thee serue, his raunsome so to pay: Or, if thou wilt not that from prison he shall part, Then as a guiltie wretch, in his best time him slay. He cannot see thee, lest (he dutious) thee may serue, Needs must hee rest thy slaue, for who hath venim tane, A counter-poyson seekes, himselfe so to preserue, Or findeth Death out, for to ease him of his paine. That torment (sudddainly) which gentle Death doth kill, Ought not to be lamented, when it riddes all griefe: Whereas my woes are heauie, during (alwayes) ill, Ah then, kill me (on suddaine) or yeeld me reliefe. For happier is the Tombe, then is his vitall breath, Who rightly liueth not, but (wretched) languisheth. [(LADIE) how much doe I respect and loue] (LADIE) how much doe I respect and loue Your beautie rare, which doeth my heart controule? When (lest that you to anger I should moue) I bite my tongue, and silent am in soule. Ore me you haue (still) such a hand, As, none but you, may me command. I rather chuse, a thousand times to die, Without offending your most heauenly face: Then like to Dedals sonne, fall foolishly, And so, through rashnes, end my youthfull race. Borne was I, for to be your slaue, My seruice, you (alone) shall haue. If I of you, such reuerent regard Haue, as to you, I dare not tell my griefe: Ah then, but gesse my Crosses ouerhard, By these my teares, I bide without reliefe. Thinke that (as others, I doe mourne, The fire kept close, more hote doeth burne, Before, to you, my cares I will bewray, Ile perish, as your loyall sernant true: Death cannot be so grieuous any way, As for to be offensiue vnto you. So you be not displeasd by me, The losse of life, no losse shall be. A double burning burthen I doe beare, My selfe consuming with a two-fold woe: First, for because I loue, and hold you deare, And next, because I dare not tell you so. A pittious paine, that to conceale, Which most we couet to reueale. The Law doth men (sometimes) compell and make, All that they know, not to disclose or tell: But LOVE all speech away from vs doth take, Which is a plague, as bad as second Hell. We must not for our selues once speake, Whilst silence makes our hearts to breake. But though my tongue most secretly, this ill Doth keepe, my pittious eyes yet shew the same: Thus whilst I loyall do continue still, I counted am a coward, to my shame. Because that I am ouer kinde, I am condemn'd of abiect minde. To reape for louing true, a mortall wound, I holde is as a sacred thing diuine: And so I rather wish, dead to be found, Then a deniall, should cause ruine mine. What neede I (then,) my griefes her show? When what I would (faire shee) doth know. He rather flie to Heauen, with swiftest wing, Then that mine earnest sute, my Dame should grieue: To speake too much, much danger oft doth bring, A Sentence.When warie silence nere doth blame receiue. Of Gods we learne secret to bee, Little to say, and much to see. Then (Dearest) since thou art not ignorant Of my hard state, rue on my pittious plight: Which though in colours, forth I do not paint, Yet they, in conscience merit fauour right. A Sentence.Who serueth well, though he (not crauing) stand, Yet doth his good deserts enough demand. ECCO. Harke (Goddesse of these Woods) vnto my neuer ceaslesse cries, Who here most blessedly dost liue, exempt from vanities. Thou Goddesse, which through knowledge thine, of prudent fore-seeing Fate, Doest know our endes, and deaths, and of our liues, the course and state. Goddesse of heauenly Nature right, to whom Ioue doeth reueale Great secerets of importance, and nought from thee doth conceale. Thou, that of vs, according to thy owne will, doest dispose, Thou, which one while doest make vs liue in ioy, and then in woes. To thee, to thee (doe I appeale: To answere me) then come, Whose voyce seemes for to flie from out, a hollow ghastly Tombe. Who shall relieue my woes, and breathe into me vitall breath? Into my soule ore-chargde with griefe, and ouerwhelmde with death? ECCO. Death. In what estate shall Loue (which cuts my wings of thoughts ore-glad) Finde my poore minde, which when it left it, left it ouer sad? ECCO. Ouer-sad. What, with my heart, once strong as steele, gainst griefes shall then be done? Since hardly it was made to yeeld: shall it be ouercome? ECCO. Ouercome. After so many wearie toyles, where-through I needs must perish, What will my Lady count of this, my too too deare bought seruice? ECCO. Vice. But shall I from this wretched state, whilst I doe liue, be free? Or shall I still, vnto her will (as seruile) Bond-slaue bee? ECCO. Bond-slaue bee. Ah say, what good at length shall I find, in this my cold damage? What new come nouell Accident, shall set a fire my courage? ECCO. Courage. Shall Rage and Furie then, within my bones vnconstant burne? And for to quench this flaming fire, to me shall none returne? ECCO. None returne. Who is the cause of this my griefe, and of mine vsuall paine, Since I haue alwaies honoured the great Palladian? ECCO. Palladian. Why sencelesse find I sences mine, from Reason (thus) to moue? Who workes this vncoth feare in me? Say, is it cruell Loue? ECCO. Cruell Loue. And is it cruell to one, that is the authour of my griefe, The greatest of Gods, that will mongst God, be honored first and chiefe. ECCO. First and chiefe. Shall I then be vnfortunate, starre-crossed in my will? And (without succour) succourlesse, must I continue still? ECCO. Continue still. Ah Arcas, miserable wretch, behold now (here) the life Which thou must lead, whilst thou dost liue, begirt with sorrow rise. Chuse rather death, then thus to liue, in endlesse miserie, (By dying) all thy griefes doe end, thy woes and anguish die. Seeke in this vncoth Desart sad, some kind of gentle death, Who's plungd in paine, should nire desire to draw his vitall breath. A Sentence. One plague's as bad, as is some death, one death ends torments all, Then death, not life, Ile chuse, and take of euills what is most small. [Who, silent (now) attends his Ladies kind replie] Who, silent (now) attends his Ladies kind replie, Whilst to his heart, she wounds doth dart, with her faire eye. [The Rosie bud, which winde bloweth here and there amaine] The Rosie bud, which winde bloweth here and there amaine, Holding his head downe, which he raiseth vp againe. [O mightie LOVE, not Ioue: (though mightiest God he bee)] O mightie LOVE, not Ioue: (though mightiest God he bee) Can bring to passe such wonders, as are done by thee. [Hee was ordainde for further ill, to goe his way] Hee was ordainde for further ill, to goe his way, A Sentence.Nor doth the life of Man, stand alwayes at one stay. [Her eyes, was his bright Sunne, he none desirde but her] Her eyes, was his bright Sunne, he none desirde but her, She onely faire was, her aboue (none else) he did prefer. [No perill (to giue ore her purpose) can her make] No perill (to giue ore her purpose) can her make, So little care, shee of her loathed life doth take. [Her vitall spirits faile her, and she falls forlorne] Her vitall spirits faile her, and she falls forlorne, Like one that is vnto his graue (vntimely) borne. [Euen as Achilles did himselfe, a slaue to Brixis yeeld] Euen as Achilles did himselfe, a slaue to Brixis yeeld, Although shee was his slaue by law, and wonne by him in field. [So for the bodie of Achilles deere friend slaine] So for the bodie of Achilles deere friend slaine, The Greekes and Troyans, hand to hand, doe fight amaine. [So Greekes did waile Achilles death (of great renowne,)] So Greekes did waile Achilles death (of great renowne,) So Troyans, Hector moande (chiefe Fortresse of their towne. [For others good and profit, I (outragious) still] For others good and profit, I (outragious) still Consume, what doth my proper vigor entertaine: And though my burning is not (vnto anie) ill, Where I should praisde be, they vngratefull me doe name. Father of liuing Creatures all, I am renoumde, And Lord I am ouer the Time, on earth, that staies: Yet doth a little thing dant mee, and me confound, And of a Conquerour, conquered, forceth mee strait-waies. But in the end, although that I am plagued thus, Through succour of the windes, when (all) thinke I am dead, I rise againe, to men (oftimes) most dangerous, And through my harmefull rage, I fill them full of dread. My mother I deuour, whilst I a straunger nourish, (For ill) I good doe to my spightfull enemies: Iudge then, since Serpents in my bosome, I doe cherish, If I ore wretched am not, in most pittious wise. [To Louers what good doth the Sunne] To Louers what good doth the Sunne, If by his beames they be vndone? LOVE'S as bitter as is Rue, Blest are such, as nere it knew. He is accurst that comes tot'h Sea Once more, and in port maist haue ease. To Louers, what good doth their Sunne, If by his beames they are vndone? A fond Louer doth not merit, Name, nor fame, of man t'inherit: Since he is foe to his owne health, Whilst in fire he burnes him else. To Louers, what good doth their Sunne, If by his beames they be vndone? Griefe on Loue tendeth nie, Pleasure is his enemies: Better laugh, then wade and sigh, Who then Loues not his owne life? To Louer's what good doth, If by his beames. Without teares no Louer is, Nor his sad laments doth misse: Better farre to liue at ease, Then to seeke a shrowe to please. To Louers what good, If by his beames. Wretched then be such as loue, Ile liue free, nor it will proue. For who'le count of him, that still (Like sot) his woes nourish nill. To Louers, what good doth the Sunne, If by his beames he be vndone? The end of the second daies meeting of Iuliettaes Shepheards. THE THIRD DAIES MEETING OF IVLIETTAES SHEPHEARDS. [My soule, say to me (now) where art?] My soule, say to me (now) where art? Where liuest thou (speake my poore hart!) The Louer that doth liue apart, Without his Mistris faire: Is like a shadowe substancelesse, Where nought but griefe the life doth presse, As pisture of sad heauinesse. And counterfeit of care. Say Phœbus, what good ist to me, Though Skies I view guilded to be? If my adorde Sunne I not see To please my pittious eyne? Can Ceres (of me) praise deserue, Though all the ground with Corne doth swarue, When I through hunger pure doe starue, And readie am to pine? My broken ioyes, repaire who may, Who can my weeping Conduits stay, Since who of sorrow is the pray Belongeth vnto griefe? Mine eyes which death orechargeth sore, (As now) can waile, and weepe no more: Since shee is gone whom I adore, And who brought them reliefe. My hart through sorrow's waxen cold, Loosing what hee most deare did hold, Blessed, if that in graue enrold He were, his hopes being past. No comfort to my soule's arriude, He seekes the meanes to be disliude, So Piramus of Loue depriude, Gaue vp his latest gaspe. Now I, my cruell Faire haue lost, Of what sweet comfort may I boast? Yet for ones Mistris to be lost, The paines of death or pleasure. He is not bound in world to liue, Who (alwayes languishing) doth grieue, When hee, (by dying) may it relieue, Which to him is a Treasure. The Sunne, though hidden be his beames, Extinguisht yet are not his gleames, So Lady mine, her sight forth streames, Though she is farre from me. More cruell did I feele the paine, When her faire glaunce burnt euery vaine, Respecting what I now doe gaine, Although shee absent be. When shee was tooke from me away, Why then did not my heart some slay? For who with Conquerour his, is pray, Cannot be said to die, Ah cruell day, and lucklesse time, When as I lost those lookes diuine, My soule (consumde) away did pine, Wanting that Deitie. Then seeing that depriude I am Of her, no longer liue I can, My Fortunes hard, Ile curse and ban, Expecting still for death. Withouten soule, no bodie liues, His Mistris losse, a Louer grieues: Whilst he such wofull torments prieues, As none feele like on earth. Now doe I meane, in this my verse, to tell that thy beautie Hath by thy glaunces sweet, of freeman made me a Bond-slaue: When mine eies surprisde with a feare more terrible then death, Gan ouer-bold to cast lookes on thy heauenly feature. So will I tell how since that time, I neuer had one day, But that my thought, and my minde haue runne of Loue still raving Nor haue I dreamd of aught, but of that blind little Elfe, Loue, Who hath my heart kept captiue, and my soule as a prisoner. Yet is he happie, that can serue a dame so tryumphant. Happie is he, that is bound in a chaine so sweet and so louely, That all carking care driues from me, lest I be grieued, In that I am thy seruant true, I blest doe account me. Who like the sacred Sunne, doest glad the world and his ofspring. For so diuine a soule as thou, who would not endanger Life, and himselfe, and what he hath that is aught worth? No disgrace tis, of braue Captaine, for to be vanquisht. Loue ne're soiournes in the hearts of cowardly Milkesops, But in the thoughts of Noble men, most fierce doth he combat: And great Ladies mindes he seekes to keepe in his owne puet. Wofull witnesse hereof is Dido, cruelly destned. And those kind sisters that Thesius sau'de from his ending, Hercules that Demigod, that Monsters conquered and Fiends: Had for his foes, theeues and Loue that warre made against him, Die did he, for pure loue, who the pride of the world did encounter: And wicked Tyrants did send to hell with a mischiefe. So did Achilles loue in his prime, and he but a youngling, Was by the craftie meanes of his foe, most cruelly murdred: Greatest states haue lou'd, why then for loue should I blam'd be? If that I seeke (as they) to loue thee my Goddesse aboue all, Not any things here in this earth, compared to thy beautie. Not any things here in this earth, that like to thy sweet selfe May vaunt to giue lawes, as Gods that dwell in the cleere skie. For Loue falling in loue, with thy faire face, and with thy rose cheeke, Plaies like a wanton in thine eies, and like to a Babie. Nor doth he liue but in thee, who art his Court and his Heauen. Happie thou, that canst command so loftie a God-head. Such and so rare thy fauour is, thy grace so beseeming, As their Pallas most diuine, doth seeke to repose her On thy cherrie lippes, hunnie sucking, Mercurie seazeth. And thy sacred Angels voice, is the voice of Apollo. And to be briefe, th'art so diuine, as fewe thee resemble: Fewe, or none that liues in this world so beautifull as thou. Then will I loue thee; what doe I say? too little a thing tis, Lesse that I worship, doe to thee as vnto a Goddesse. Then to thee as immortall wight, my life I doe offer, And my loyall heart doe I sacrifice to thy beautie. Whilst I hung on thine Altar, this my verse, which hath chaunted With thousand close sighes, the praises of many others, But yet neuer honoured any, like to thy rare selfe: Wondred at of men, of Gods most worthily worshipt. Then this my chast voice receiue, as heauenly powers doe. And vouchsafe for this song, a corner of thy sweet Altar, Vnto the end I deeply may engraue in the same place, How in coarse, and in minde, thou fram'd art daintily perfect, And that nothing equall can thy feature immortall, Who art honours louely Nurse, and Eternities owne childe. [The Muses (Goddesse faire) this chast verse offer thee] The Muses (Goddesse faire) this chast verse offer thee, And to thy peerlesse Coarse, and Beauties excellence: To praise the good, to blame such wights as wicked be, Is honors double gaine, and double recompence. Another Quatersan. If thou Dianaes name, her beautie, and her wit doest beare, Who it adornd in heauens, whilst thou below dost soiourne here? What reason is it then, but that we worship thee likewise, As wee the mighty Gods doe, and like honors, thee deuise? Another. Too small a toy this Lawrell is, to make for thee a Crowne, Thy temples to embellish faire, thou art of such renowne. Tis mortals gaine this honour, yet as we present to thee, Immortall verses, so with such, the Gods presented bee. Another. Rare vertue neuer honoured is enough, at any time, Nor can we too much make to smoake, her Altars ore diuine. Then if thy workes (as hers) immortall right doe show, Wonder thou not, though beauties thine be worshipt so. Another. Queene of our workes, and Princesse of our hart, Of our chaste minds we offer thee best part. Our verse, it is, through which the Conquerour liues, Which to his deeds, most heauenly brightnes giues. Another. Blest be our Queene, immortall she alwaies, In words and deeds we'ele honour her with praise. Whose bodie beautious, and whose soule is faire, And who for gifts with Pallas may compare? Another. The Oxe, to Iupiter we vse to sacrifice, To Baccus, Wine, the Goate to Pan, we giue likewise. Corne vnto Ceres, and sweet Myrre we Cupid offer, But vnto thee (who vice dost hate) our verse we proffer. Another. Thy Feature faire, nor stately Gate, hath vs orecome, Tis none of these, thy vertue tis that this hath done. He is not vanquished, that hath endurde the sight Of one that is farre more in power, then mortall might. Another. Mongst thousand honours due vnto thy glorious Deitie, Receiue our verses, and these Flowers, as offerings to thy beautie. Small tryumph for the Captaine tis, to foyle his enemie, Vnlesse Apollos sisters ring out his victorie. Another. [Now must the Gods aboue] Now must the Gods aboue, And all the heauens that moue, Of Diana praises sing, That may hereafter ring. Now must me with knot fine, The Lawrell greene combine: With th'oliue, that his haire, May be adornd more faire. O Cibile, whom the skies Doth worship reuerently: Giue v's of Flowers gay, That Garlands make we may: Yee Muses that doe chaunt, And of worlds honour vaunt: Giue vs Inuention still, From forth your sacred hill. O Maias learned Sonne, Giue vs a hunnie tongue: And with thy rods vs touch, That we may pleasure much. Yee Gods and Goddesse, Beston your worthines: That we may celebrate, Our noble Princesse state. Who with renowme doth liue, Whose deeds forth honour giue: A thing most worthie tis, To praise what worthie is. Then each where we will tell, Her glorie doth excell: (Faire) we of thee will sing. And make our song to ring, Of thee and of thy acts, Of thy victorious facts. Thy beautie wee'le not hide, Which in thy lookes doth bide; Being full of Maiestie, Whilst thou most worthily, For chastitie doest gaine, What Hippolit did (staine) Liue then, and die thou neuer, But be thou crownd for euer, With Coronet diuine, Becomming wearing thine. And neuer may thy hart, Feele sorrow, teene or smart. Still may thy vertue yeeld, Flowers fit, for such a field. And ore Loue dominere, And with thy lookes him feare. Daunt such as ouer-hold, Thy honour dare behold. Let vs right glorie finde, Within thy peerlesse minde. Celestiall things still loue, What mortall is nere proue. This only of thy beautie, We sing as is our dutie. And though thou in thy heart, More firme and loyall art Then loyatie it selfe, (wealth) (Since Loue, takes place fore May we of thee alone, Ay thinke, or else of none. So death it selfe may haue, No power thee for to braue. So maist thou alwaies flourish, Although we die and perish. Like Phœbus Lawrall greene, That fresh is alwaies seene. So will we wish, that care Thy Feature nere impaire. And that what thou dost craue, Thou euer maist it haue. That blacke dispaire, thy soule, With thoughts may nere controule. And that no griefe may cease On thee, to wound thy peace. That Ioue may ding th? downe Who on thy good doe frowne. And enuious are through spite, To see how thou shin'st bright. Since all the Gods doe shew, Their power here below. (A signe that'le thee defend,) Vnto the world his end. Then feare not, for they will Protect, and shield thee still. Whilst thy renowme shall shine, Encreasing time from time. Enfranchising with ioy, Thy selfe free from annoy. To th'end thou helpe vs may, Whom (onely) we obay. Faire) then these verses take, Which we penne for thy sake. Our selues, nor life, our soule, Doe as thou please controule. By all thy deeds of honour, Which thou hidst in a manner. DEARE graunt this Boone, past bee, Tis (all) we beg of thee. [About what time the earth (withouten sowing) plentiously] About what time the earth (withouten sowing) plentiously, Brought vnto men their Haruest rich, (and that continually) When as the wisht for bearded Corne, which Ceres forth doth bring, Waxt ripe, without all cockle bad, in fields faire glistering. When bended Trees, in Autums raine, with burdens there did grone, So full of fruit they hung, without deceiuing any one. When euery hedge a vineyard was, and that in goodly show, Thousand, and thousand bunches thicke, of grapes each where did grow. When as the harmelesse flocks of beasts, and thick-woolld bleating sheepe, Did roue themselues abroad alone, and on the mountaines keepe. When all the long day, Heads of Cattell grazde euery where, Withouten doubt of Wolfe, or Foxe, of Tyger or of Beare. When Elmes and Beech, with stately Okes, drop honie downe amaine, Which on the plants and tender hearbes, in deawie wise did raine. Before that any thunder cracke, and lightnings flashie blast, On flintie marble Rocks did seaze, and them in middest brast. When all was quiet, full of peace, and when this selfesame place, Blessed Astrea with her gifts most happilie did grace. When fire and sword, hard Iron and steele, were banished away, Which (at the first) the causers were, of worlds and mans decay. When that in steed of blood and warre, was nothing but milde peace, Which made the earth, with thousand ioyes, to flourish and encrease. In that blest time and happie age, a Shepheardesse did liue, To whom (all) for her beautie rare, the palme and prize did giue. Thrise happie Stella was she cleapt, and well she might be so, For neuer starre in firmament, more faire and bright did show. As Luna when in midst of pride she sheweth, in frostie night, With sparkling lights, attended on; so shon her beautie bright. But yet (alas) the mortall woes, and hard end she did passe, Did testifie, but too too well, that she not happie was. The names of things to the natures oft; accord and well agree, And yet to the names, the natures (oft) discordant shew to bee. Malitious LOVE, as subtill spie, abounding in all malice, Amongst sweete pleasures, seekes to sowe errors and shamefull vice. He likes (alife) sorrow and griefe, to chop our ioyes among, And pleasure ours, to turne to paine, the more to doe vs wrong. Iealous he is of mortalls good, of their sweet ease and rest, And in their actions (them to crosse) he makes an vsuall iest. This made him cast himselfe into the eies of this maide faire, Which as a torch seru'de for to set a fire most deadly care. Of her bright glaunces (diamonds right) he forged all his darts, With which he (as mercifull) did pierce the loyalst harts. Her flaxen haires were bands, wherewith (as Conquor) he controld, And bound most fast, the soules that were most wariest and most bold. Of her sweet smiles and pleasing speech, he made a luring baite, Through which, to rauish minde and sense he (couert) lay in waite. As with the sound of his rare Harpe, when Orpheus vsde to sing, Hard stubborne Rocks and liuelesse woods, he forst to follow him. As beasts and Birds did tend on him, as gastly spirit of hell: To list to Musicke his, of their owne mindes did them compell. And as the fowler slie, by note of his deceitfull pipe, The simple Bird (vnwittingly) arawes in his net to light. And as the adamant, that nere by lightning taketh flawe, The Iron by a secret power vnto him close doth drawe. So by the louely smiles, and by the sugred speech and grace, Of this rare Damozell, Loue did charme the minds of men apace. By th'unnie of her daintie tongue, they too too credulous, Themselues did offer for to fall in daunger perilous. Now in this place liu'd Shepheards twaine, the proprests of all others, In stuture tall, and vpright height, there were not two such Louers. Nor were they onely goodly wights, but strong withall and stout, Oft they the Beare and Lion chaste the Forrest all about. For hunting (at that time) was all their sport and their delight, This pleasing trauaile being the life, that pleased them aright. Nor was (as then) knowne vnto them, Bellonas bloodie rage, Nor did vaine Loue, seeke them to vex, in prime of their greene age. No brawles, nor loud debates mongst them, was there, them for to grieue, Old Saturne in the golden world, more happier did not liue. (Withouten telling,) store of corne came forth of fruitfull field, Withouten dressing viniards aught, the Viniards, grapes did yeeld. Their beasts increast, Sanus taking paine, their Muttons brought forth wooll, Their bleating Ewes with skipping Lambs were alwaies big &amp; full. But now (behold) in Ambuscade, how Loue doth lie alwaies, Meaning with vncoth cruelties, his honour more to raise. Seazing vpon them (through his might) and on their liberties, The better for to make them tast of his disloyalties. For one day as those harmelesse Swaines did homewards come amaine, Halfe windelesse, and halfe wearied in pursuing of their game, Each of them, a huge wilde Boores head, holding within their hand, Tirde with their sport they had abroad, drie, as they could scarce stand To drinke, and rest themselues awhile, they to a spring did come, Whose water was as colde as Ice, and cleare as any Sunne. A stately Rocke from forth the foote, did issue of this spring, Bout which, a thousand Cipresse Trees stood thicke inuironing. Into this Fountaine (as they say) a Nymph was chaungde sometimes, (And it might well be) for most bright and glorious like it shines. Round all about the same, of Turfs most greene was there a seate, By artificiall Nature framde, most pleasnt and most neate. Here meant they to repose themselues, and here they meant to lie, Whilst with this water coole, they sought to quench their thirst ore drie. But as they thought to lay them downe vpon this bankeside cold, They might a wonderous beautie rich, soundly to sleepe behold. And Stella faire it was, for then, Shepheards might at that time, Amiddest Shepheardesses sleepe, without suspect of crime. (As then) their modest chastitie to staine, each one did feare, For, as they in their mindes were chast, so they in bodie were. Amazde they stood at this sweet face, their drought they had forgot, For now another thirst then that, did drie them farre more hot. Nor cared they (now) for to sleepe, all sleepe they banisht quite, Whilst they as dreaming stood, to view such an vnlookt for sight. They play the wanton Louers (now) whilst with their rolling eie, They nothing doe but onely marke how sweetely she doth lie. As senslesse Rocke, Sanus power they seeme, nor can they stir or rise, Nor other pleasure take they, but to marke her with their eies. Meane time, this beautious face, which them doth gently to her traine, Smiles, as she sleepes, to see how they doe blush (orecome with shame. So is he daunted, who orebold with ouer-daring winke, Thats able for to looke against the Sunnie beames doth thinke. So such as are presumptuous, did too too fondly stare Vpon Medusa, into stones, and flints, soone changed were. Our Shepheards (so being rauished) would neuer ?lin? nor rest, To view one while her louely face, and then, her milke-white brest. Another while they marke her long and yellow flaxen haire, Which gentle windes (as waues of Seas) did moue, now here, now there. Not halfe so faire the golden locks of stubborne Absolon Shewed, as were hers, nor did they seeme so trimme, to looke vpon. Her forhead large, they then did view, as smooth as any Iet, Where (oft) the Graces, in their pride (to make them merrie) met. Nor they forgot her Eielids small, which Loue with his pure fire, Had somewhat blackish made to seeme, the more to breed desire. Rare Eielids, which through her two spheres, euen mongst the very Gods, (Through kind of shadowing sweet) did make them more admirde by ods. Her eies as then they could not view, her eies with Diamonds right, Which, when they opte, the heauens did shew, discouering true delight. Then to her matchlesse mouth they come, most daintie, Sanus compare, How often wisht they it to kisse, but that they durst not dare. A iust report did them debarre, so much for to forget Themselues, as that to doe which might be vnto them a let. Whereby their Ladies afterward they might offend and grieue, Which (fore a loyall Louer so would doe) he would not liue. Vpon her cherrie lippe, where die of Gillsflowers did flowe, The damaske Rose along the same, ranne spredding too and fro. Her beautious cheeke, most freshly shewde, like the Vermillion flower, Cheekes, which (harts made of flintie Rocke) for to controule, had power. Her dimpled chinne, and snowy necke, the Tower of statelines, Not Iunos necke so seemely shewd, and Venus, farre was lesse, So were her brests imbellished with riches manifold, Ah who so faire a sight could see, and not be ouerbold? There was the bosome which did part the milkie way aright, That leades into the golden field, the center of delight. There were those sacred mountaines twaine, where perfect ioy doth rest, None mount those hallowed hills, but such as borne were to be blest. O pleasure vnconceiu'd, to haue the grace them for to touch, But to haue licence them to kisse, to die it were not much. Her supple hand in seemely sort did lie, and comely wise, Her fingers such, as fault to find in them, none could deuise. And last of all (though couered) stretcht out her round cleane foote, Supporter of that building braue, of beautious forme the roote. The rest (and better part) lay hid, yet what was to be seene, (To make one lose his libertie) enough and more had bene. Had Ioue seene one but halfe so faire, he had of her esteemd, Mars would haue yeelden, Phœbus sade, and well of her bane deemd. Thus at one time, these Shepheards twaine, are falne to be in loue, Whilst one and selfesame griefe, they both lust at one time doe proue. Their soules are touched to the quicke, with this one golden dart, Of thousand amorous wishes sweet, they feele the teene and smart. LOVE, hath two arrowes, one of gold, and that doth breed the fire, The others lead, and that doth quench by little all desire. Th'one on the sodaine pierceth, but the other doth no harme, Th'one doth encrease the fire, the other gainst it is a charme. These two strange darts of Cupid proud, Stella felt in her soule, Th'one forc't her loue, but the other did all loue with checke controule. One of these Shepheards she did like, the other she so sore Did hate, against the sillie wretch a monstrous spight she bare. Th'one Coridon was cald, whom she in hart still honoured, The other, Aridon, into a hard Rocke altered. But now (to come whereas we left) our Shepheardesse doth wake, And lifting vp her head, she leaue (as then) of sleepe did take. For she was frighted with a dreame, that did not please her well, A dreame (that as an Oracle) did her mishaps foretell. But when she sawe these Shepheards twaine, she was amazed fore, To see them lie so night to her, she wonder did the more. Yet this her wondring, her became the better, cause she blusht, Whilst she more faire did shew, when through her face the colour flushd. Her eies she cast on the ground, and at vnwares so tooke, By them (vpon the soden) she durst not vpon them to looke. That done, with sad and heedfull care, she doth about her prie, Lest, what not comely had bene, they about her might espie. In th'end, she findes all well, not much vnlike the trauellere, Who doubts some theeues, but hauing found all cleare, then doth not feare. Mean time, poore Cloridou, who is perplext most dangerus, Takes heart at grasse whilst boldly he, gins to accost her thus. Faire light of my best life, why art thou thus possest with care, When heauens themselues, thy vertuous life, hurt cannot, nor once dare? Chaste is thy soule, vertuous thy minde, most beautifull thy face, No Tyger fierce, or Lion fell, thy beautie dare disgrace. The diuels themselues cannot thee hurt, why doubts thou? things diuine, Are not (as mortall be) to shame subiect at any time. The Gods, haue made thee goodly, that the heauens might honour thee, Our spirits, are bodies framde, that thou by vs mighst worshipt bee. Thee will we serue in humble wise, with dutifull respect, Nor whilst we liue (as vs becomes) our duties weele neglect. Then sacred Saint, thy selfe assure, my soule thus languishing, No bad conceit through carriage mine, to thee shall euer bring. No rash attempt (vndecently) shall make me ouerbold With her whome Mistris of my hart, and my chiefe good I hold. Then doe all dread abandon quite, looke merrie, and be blithe. For we both honour thee, and for thy Loue contend and striue. So said the Shepheard, whilst that Loue did shoote in cunning wise, Fancies swift darts into his hart, which came from Stellas eies, From Stellas eies, who now begins to feele an vncoth flame, And who doth finde (as Cloridan) to bide the selfesame paine. She findes she forced is to loue, although against her will, And more she seekes him to expell, the more he entreth still. The Shepheards words are wounds to her and pierce her like a dart, His speeches breaches be, which soone make entrance in her hart. And now (on soden) Cloridon she liketh (and so well,) As (in her sight) for beautie he doth onely beare the bell. And so likewise doth Cloridan thinke of his daintie Loue, Vowing within his soule, that death shall not her thence remoue. So in the Phrigian forrest thicke, when Paris liu'de vnknowne, In Enons Loue (he was intrapt) and (for the same) did mone. Of whose deare loue, that loyall Nymph so highly did esteeme, As after he was slaine, to mourne for him she (aie) was seene. But Stella somewhat fearfull now, and blushing in this case, Vnto her Shepheard thus replide, with comely bashfull grace. A worthie Shepheard (like thy selfe) I neuer doubted yet, That (for to offer wrong to me) his honour would forget. The minde that generous is indeed, and doth for glorie wade, Is nere so base, as to abuse a sillie harmelesse maide. His honour he doth holy wracke vpon discredits shelfe, That hauing others conquered braue, cannot orecome himselfe. It better him becomes to hunt, the Lion or the Bare, The greedie Wolfe, wilde Boore and fierce, then sillie Damosels faire: No glorie tis, much for to force, or proudly to command, As haue no might, nor any power, such furie to withstand. But I assure me of thy selfe, and that I trust thee thus, Thou seest, I doe not flie from thee, as one ore timerus. Besides (with blushing) I confesse, thou art the first of all, That hast against my will, enforct me follow Cupids call. A soule thou hast (that Loue as now) compelleth to be thine, Loue that doth both our harts in one, in loyall bands combine. That Loue which makes me yeeld to thee, for to be ouerthrowne, That Loue, which Tyrant-like denies, that I shall be mine owne. Then looke that in this loue, thou doe mine honour still preserue, It being all, that for our paines, we righly shall deserue. For thou shalt sooner Stella see in graue for to remaine, Before that any vitious soule, her vertuous life shall staine. Shee'le rather die a thousand times, for constant amitie, The treasure is, which I doe rate at endlesse price so hie. Chastely to loue in vertuous sort, is sure a worthie thing, And heauens themselues to modest Loue, a ioyfull end will bring. Remember then what I doe say, or trouble me no more, Faire words without performance true, I loathe and doe abore. So Stella said, and Cloridan to heare these words of ioy, So rauisht was, as now he quite forgot all former noy. Nor could he speake for gladnes, while his hart did leape within, He knew not how to frame his tale, or which way to begin. As dead men we, through ouermuch displeasing griefe, become, So sudden pleasure ouermuch, stops passage of our tongue. Both th'one and th'other, oftentimes, vs too too much doth moue, Extremities of both (without a meane) we often proue. Many through pleasure die, their daies many doe end through woe. Griefe kills our sences sodenly, and ioy likewise doth so. And after winter, many stormes and rainie shewers apace, The Sunne begins (by little) for to shew to vs his face. The plants and Trees reuiue againe, looking both fresh and greene, Which in the frostie season cold, through snow did lie vnseene. So at the last, the Shepheard got his wonted speech againe, And pleasure former dread and feare, did chase away amaine Which being gone, as soone as time did breath to him affoord, In humble wise, he once more thus began her for to boord. (Sweet Ladie) since the law diuine of Cupid heauenly king, Such fauours great doth shew to me, (not of my meriting) And that I blest am so, that to your hart mine tied is, (A cause our chast desires are like for to obtaine rare blisse.) And since our mindes are so vnite, and knit in bonds so strong, As death it selfe with all his force, shall neuer doe vs wrong. I vow for to be yours alone, hap ill to me or well, Despite of destinie, despite of Fortune, spite of hell. For to be loued of thy selfe, it passeth, and is such, As like no glorie is on earth for to be found by much. When Adon Venus did enioy, so blessed was not he, Nor Pirams loue to Thisbe could, so hot and ardent be. The Gods themselues in glorie theirs, who are redoubtable, In pleasure with me to compare cannot, nor are not able. More fortunate am I then they, my hart is more content, Then when Ioue with Europa liu'd, and time away so spent. A thousand Almours in my minde I feele for to be hid, More sweet, then when Leander kind, embrace his Hero did. With Paris vaine, is Hellens ioy compared vnto mine, My fancies are so sweet, they seeme as if they were diuine. None is so happie as my selfe; th'Ambrosia of the Gods, Not so much liketh them, as doth my life like me, by ods. Ah then amongst contentments such, doe not me so much grieue, As for to thinke to offer thee dishonour I would liue. No, no, I held thee too too deare, and at too high a rate, And more of thee, I doe esteeme, then of mine owne estate. Wrong me not so, for from the heauens, the Sunne shall swiftly fall, And I my life will sacrifice, before that happen shall. A great offence with punishment, most grieuous plagued is, Then thinke not ile forget my selfe, to doe (so much) amisse. And that I will performe my word my promise thou shalt haue, So that (with leaue) my mouth of thee this tinie Boone may craue. Onely to kisse thy sacred hand, is that which I request, That hand of thine, which being toucht, shall make me (liuing) blest. No other good (for all my paines) then this I will require, For all my loue, and my good will, I will no may desire. Graunt me my suit, that as my soule is rauisht with thine eies, So by the same, may rauisht be, my life, in selfesame wise. Which if I shall obtaine, ile iudge, my ioyes for to abound, And that (so happie as my selfe) no Louer liues on ground. So said, his Mistris kind, to yeeld this fauour is content, Giuing her hand to him, which he doth kisse incontinent. Thrise blessed hand, which through thy power, doth quench so hot a flame, And through thy gentle touch, the rage asswagest of the same. She powers the drops of pittie, on his more than burning fire, And from his hart plucks forth those darts, there fixed through desire. And now is Cloridan content, and eased of his smart, He goeth no farther, nor makes shew from promise his to part. Yet in his hope is comfort hid, he hopes well in his minde, And in assurance he doth liue, some better good to finde. Meane space, Dan Phœbus leaues his worke, his taske he hauing done, His place resigning, Sisters his, that she her course may runne. When being wearied of his toyle, he gets him to his bed, Whilst Luna pale, amongst the clouds appeares, with horned hed. This is the cause that Cloridan, halfe angrie takes his leaue, Whilst homeward for to goe, his hart with thousand thoughts doth heaue. The day he doth accuse, as one, vnconstant wauering, That daies nere long enough, when one hopes, that good twill him bring. But he must packe from thence, and men the Gods ought to obay, Who haue as well the night ordaind, as they did make the day. His leaue of Stella he doth take, and praieth her be so kind, That he next morning in that place, her louely selfe may find. Which she doth promise (halfe compeld) for Loue doth force her please Her amorous Swaine, and meanes to seeke his torments for to ease. And (now) both part, and goe their waies, whilst vndershadowing tree, They leaue their bleating flocks to rest, which (there) in safetie bee. For Woolues, no enemies (as then) were vnto any beast, The Tiger nor the Lion then, vpon them neuerceast. But Phœbus now was scarsely rose, his wonted course to make, Nor to his brightsom: Chariot had, his firie horse betake; Nor was Aurora stollen yet, from aged Tithons side, To get vnto Eudimion lou'd, and there with him to bide. When Cloridan (whose minde did run vpon his Mistris beautie, (To whom he had deuoted all his seruice and his dutie) Leapes from his couch, for he that hopes vpon some good lucke sweet, To (come next day) hath small desire to slumber or to sleepe. He to the old place maketh hast, to wait on those faire eies, Which spoyle his rest, yet to his hart, are kind in gratious wise. Meane time the Shepheard Aridon, that wretch most miserable, To find such like (as Cloridan had found) he was not able. Most pitiously he languisheth, whilst Loue and all his law, He curseth more then thousand times, of all his woes, the cause. Faine would he leaue to loue, since he seeth he can gaine no grace, And that the fruits of Loue, he nere is like for to embrace. But all in vaine, his destinie he can no waies preuent. Nor can he aught of ill resist, what powers diuine haue ment. What he is able that he doth, but what doth it auaile, For man, LOVE to withstand, when Gods he forceth for to quaile? But as the Hart being sore hurt, the more that he doth seeke To ease him of his hurts, the more he worser is and weeke. So Aridon, in thinking how to rid him of his griefe, The worser waxeth still, and in the end, dieth sans reliefe. Nothing on earth the power of LOVE is able to controle: Like whirling Tempests, what denies, before him it doth role. So Aridon is not of strength, his feete for to retire, From forth that place that burneth him, with vnextinguisht Fire. Whilst Cloridon within himselfe, doth thinke how he is blest, Poore Aridon, his Fortunes bannes, from pleasures dispossest. Both equall in affection, but in comfort differing, Th'one sighes for his woes, the other stands his ioyes oft reckoning. Both like in passions, but in lucke, both too too contrarie, In pleasure th'one consumes his life, th'other for paine doth die. Vntill this time, the one vnto the other was a friend, Nor did the one against the other, mischieuous hate pretend. Before (as brethren sworne) they were, and so together liu'd, What th'one aid like, the other lou'd, nor th'one the other grieu'd. But at the last, faire Stellas loue, (alas that should be so) Causae this their amitie to end, and lesse and lesse to grow. The blinded Sonne of Mars, (who doth his Fathers heire right prooue) Strife and discention takes from Sire (and from his Mother) LOVE. For more he sets at variance, and whips with Discords roddes, Then be the harts he subiugates, and brings to Loue by oddes. But now is Cloridan againe vnto that Spring returnd, Which quenched had the flame, in which before he wofull burnd. The comming of his Dame he stayes with great deuotion, For now to hunt the Sauadge Bore, he thinkes not once vpon. His minde on Stella, onely runnes, (such is this sodaine change) As after Wolfe, or Lyon fierce, he careth not to range. To her his heart he doth deuote, and vnto her prefer His vitall Powers (as pawnes of Loue) engag'de be vnto her. The place he kisseth often, which with Flowers was strewde all ore, Whereas his Mistris hee had found to lye the day before. Happie he calld and counted them, more then a thousand times, Them honoring, as if they had bene some power of God diuine. He blest their beautie, and did pray, that storme nor soking raine, That Sythe, nor Plowe-share there might come, their beautie for to staine. That neither Winters colde, nor Sommers great heate, might there be seene, But that they alwayes fresh might showe, with cooly shadow greene. Thus stayeth the Shepheard, wishing still, and still expecteth sore Her comming, who (vntill she comes) each houre imagining foure. He thinks that for her he stayeth long, but when her companie He hath, he then saith Time runnes fast, and too too soone doth hie. Louers esteeme not any time, excepting such a Day, When they are sure their Mistresses, that they enioyen may. Their beautious presence is their Sunne, it is their brightest Sunne, Their absence is their darkest Night, through which they are vndone. The earthly glorie of the bodie, is the Sunne and Light, But (of our mindes) the cleare day is, faire beautie shining bright, And this they reuerently adore; The Essence of the soule, Is farre more excellent then that of bodie (sans controle.) Beautie attendeth on the soule; the Sunne on bodie waites, The Sunne (for worth) to beautie then must yeeld in all conceit. This makes the Swaine most earnestly to listen with his eare, If he, the rising of his Starre, can see for to appeare. The smallest blast of winde, or leafe, that bloweth in any wise, The Shepheard hearts, and at the noyse thereof strait vp doth rise. He look the wistel round about, and thinkes her for to see, Her, that doth force him vnto Loue, a seruile slaue to bee. Now doth he thinke, that forth her house, she is comming vnto him, And (now) he iudgeth in his minde, she is hard at hand agin. He counteth how farre off she is, then vp he starts on feete, And forward runnes, to see if he, her, on the way can meete. But now, lest by some odde by-way she comes, he feares againe, And then he pensiue sit him downe, recounting of his paine. At last, though (long it be) she comes more louely then the Morne, When rising in her glorious pride, shee Thetis couch doth scorne. Softly she comes, with Snaile-like pace, and to her selfe doth speake, Whilst feare (for losse of her good name) makes her looke pale and bleake. And as she is comming in her walke, in midst of thickest wood, She more then (often) stayeth her steppes, and doubting so, she stood. Halfe ready to turne backe, to breake her promise that was past, (For honor, which full deare she held, such doubts did make her cast.) But Loue, then on the other side, and beautie of the Swaine, A thousand new desires afresh, did breathe in her againe. He telleth her, she is bound to keepe the Oathe she made of yore, (Although that no account is made, what eger Louers swore) For LOVE himselfe doth mocke and iest, to see how Louers sweare, Louers, (but none else) doe dispence, with Oaths withouten feare. In th'end, the Nymph arriueth at th'appointed Christall spring, Where pensiue Cloridan doth walke, his thoughts still canuasing. Sometim she lay vpon the ground, with Flowers be dyapred, Where Stella (but the day before) herselfe with sleepe had fed. One while he rose, and then to lay him downe you might him finde, Now this he did, now that, for Louers troubled are in minde. Thus (being out of hope) he spies, the sight that likes him most, Which make new ioy in euery part, throughout his Coarse to cost. Quickly he runnes to her, her hands to kisse, he soone is prest, Whilst with a thousand sorts of Flowers he beautifieth her brest. She seeing these two forward prancks, her face with blushing dide, Whilst in her selfe (for this) she heares; how honor doth her chide. Aduising her to reprehend him and his leaude demeanor, And that before she yeeld, she should resigne her liues sweete Tenor. But Cupid makes her change her minde: The Shepheards beautie faire, Makes her ore-bold and from her minde, abandoneth all care. She is resolude to vse him kinde, nor with him to finde fault, But him embraceth in sweete wise, who her in aemes had caught. Now all respect of honor, and all feare of future shame, By power of Loue were banished, who her had ouercome. Loue onely is her chiefest choyse, her honor, and her pleasure, The Shepheards will, her readie wish, her ioy, and her chiefe treasure. But (in the end) to couer this, their ouer-amorous rage, Betweene themselues, they plight their faith, and promise Mariage. The witnesses were Loue, the Spring, and many colloured Flower, And thousand pretie chirping Birds, there present at that hower, All which, with cheerfull warbling Note, Hymen, Hymen, sing, And with the ECCHO of the same, the woods made for to ring. Whilst in meane time, our Louers twaine, within a bottome low, (Of a close valley) where no light scarce in the day did showe. Did reape the longde for fruits of Loue, both equall in desire, Which readie was to burne their harts, with more then vncoth fire. That done, on many Beechen Trees, and Rocks, and many a Caue, They enter last their names together, and finely them did graue. Loue knots they make on eu'ry twig, and Garlands passing gay They hang thereon, whilst pleasantly they passe the time away. Thus (for a while) their hap was blest, and sweet their destinie, Their mariage sweeter, and this held a tweluemonth (very nigh.) Nor at this space, they thought as much (as once) of time to come, The present time was onely that, which in their minds did runne. Poore soules they iudge the heauens had not power to doe them ill, Thinking this hunnie Moone with them (thus) would continue still. But all things that are mortall here, doe change as doth the time, Pleasure none sooner's come, then gone, scarce leauing any signe. Loue (as a Feather's) quickly lost, are wauering and light, As sodenly as in our brest conceiu'd tis through delight. A small thing spoyles and hinders it; The twinkling of ancie, The ioyes of any Louer soone can make to vade and die. Witnesse these twaine; whom Cupid thought liu'd pleasantly ore long, Gainst whom th'enuious heauens sore conspirde to doe them wrong. Through which, the partiall Planets wrought their ouerthrow to bee, And with a generall consent, did of their death decree. For (still) the fatall destinies by Gods aye ordered, Whilst by their sharpe Edicts gainst men, they cut their liues, not thred. Like Potters they doe play with men, who if they please, their Pot They breake which they doe make; and if they list, they breake it not. But now to let this passe; one day faire Stella did arriue, Burning with amorous paine vnto the wonted fountaine blithe. And there (expecting Cloridan) her friend she doth repose, Who was as yet (for early t'was) from out his bed (scarce) rose. Looking for him who did not come, she watcht and staid so long, That at the last, on greeuish turffe she fell in slumber strong. Meane time the lucklesse Aridon, in extreame Loue that fride, (Who so much more) the flame for to encrease within him tride By how much Cloridan he saw expelling care and Dole, To haue the hap to quench his fire, in pleasures fountaine coole. Dogs her as she doth goe from home, resoluing in his hart To die, or (else by violence) to ease him of his smart. The friendship of his friend which he did hold most deare of late, Regard to offend the honour of his dame, who him did hate. Faire honestie, nor conscience, all these his hot desire, Bridle could not, but (furious he) would to his will aspire. Whilst thus he thinkes, behold he comes whereas most pleasingly, (Yeelding as twere her selfe) he finds his cruell enemie. Which when he saw, Reason and Faith as (franticke) he neglects, And as one void of sense, from him each good thought he reiects. As on the fearefull Hunts-man pale, the wounded Lionesse, (Bleeding apace) with eger force, for to reuenge doth presse. So this same Sauadge Louer hot, this Ladie rauisheth, Whilst she vnhappie lieth a sleepe, as one withouten breath. He doth abuse her, whilst to wake she doth (as twere) begin, Yet she in such dead slumber was, as ope her eies not bin. With sleepe as (then) she was opprest with sleepe most miserable, That euer after made her life, and fortune lamentable. Still Aridon she kisseth, and most kindly doth embrace, For she (God wot) dreamd Cloridan had bene there in that place. Whilst in meane time (but in ill houre) doth Cloridon arriue, And viewes that sight, which for to see, his soule doth him distiue. He seeth how Aridon (in spite of him) doth him misvse. Who is his Spouse betroth't, and whom none but himselfe should vse. He seeth how Stella (being deceiu'd) his face doth sweetly kisse, Whilst (through her eyes as yet not ope) mistooke she fowly is. Like as the Traueller, in strait and narrow way doth spie A hissing Serpent for to come, towards him, on him to flie. Or as with crie most horrible, his passage to defend, A hideous Dragon makes to him, and rollings forth doth send. Whilst trembling through pale chilly feare, ready to giue vp Ghost, He backward turnes, nor dares he passe, whereas he wisheth most. So Cloridon with wofull griefe, with frantike Iealousie, With rage, mixt with despitefulnes, and burning frenesie. Is vexed so in inward soule, that he in desperate wise, (With sorrow madde) now here, now there, rowles vp and downe his eyes. Shame and sadde griefe so seaze on him, as he flings thence away, Nor can he bide in that bad place, there longer for to stay. Stamping and cursing vp and downe, he runnes about the ground, Seeking himselfe, through vncoth meanes, of life for to confound. Resolude he is to die, sith that his Dame he held so chaste Another loues (not him) whereby her selfe she hath defaste. But now when gracelesse Aridon, the Nymph had thus deceiu'de, He flieth away so fast, as he of her is not perceiu'de. Which made her soone to ope her eyes, when by her, seeing none, (Frighted) she leapeth vp, and stands as still as any stone. In pittious wise shee lookes about, her selfe so for to ease, Yet nothing could she see, but what her sight did more displease. Her dearely loued Cloridon, (on whom she oft doth call) She cannot spie for to appeare, or answere her at all. One while she thinkes he hides himselfe, that for him she should seeke, Another while, that he is gone, to hunt where he doth leeke. And then againe, poore soule she thinks, that she hath bene deceiu'de, And that the same she could not see, through sleepe of sight bereu'de. She thinks, if he (who was with her) had bene her Cloridon, He would not her haue left so soone, nor so soone from her gone. Thus troubled in her minde, with feare, she sits her downe alone, Whilst of her louely Shepheard she, doth stay the comming home. Each houre, a yeare seemes to her, and his staying ouer-long, Makes her to doubt all is not well, and that somewhat is wrong. She weepes, and wailes, she taketh on, and screecheth out full sore, But had she knowne his hard estate, she would haue wailed more. This gaules her still, yet Cloridon, comes not all that same day, The cause that thousand torments doe her tender hart assay. Wofull, she sits like Niobe, teares streaming from her runne, Whilst of her vtter ouerthrow, she doth presage to come. The euening come, she home retires, yet all the night no winke She sleepeth, onely of her Swaine, of him she still doth thinke. That which had past the day before, encreaseth more her woes, This runnes still in her minde, nor what to say thereof she knowes. Feare so doth trouble her, as scarce the day appeard in sight, And that Aurora had expeld the darknesse of the night, But vp she gets, and euery where, seeketh her Swaine to finde, As is the youthfull Hart sought out, by his beloued Hinde. Her husband Cloridon she seekes, and searcheth all about, She looketh for him in the woods, and thickets all throughout. A thousand times she too and fro, vnto the Spring doth runne, To see if he by chaunce (as was his wont) were thither come. But when she doth not finde him there, she then misdoubts the worst, Of some mischaunce that hapned is, and counts her selfe accurst. Yet for all this, she giues not ore, although shee's in dispaire, She trottteth still, she searcheth still, and prieth here and there. The name of Cloridan, she oft repeateth, and doth call, Yet none except the ECCO shrill, doth answere her at all. Ah, what sharp griefs and passions sad, to vexe her did she prooue? Before that she her Cloridan, found well-nigh dead, through loue. Who (wearie for to languish, as sorrowes seruile slaue, With his owne sword, a mortall wound, within his body gaue. After he had a thousand times blamde his disloyall Dame, Accursed Loue, (as most vniust) hating his amorous flame. Within the bottome of a Rocke, beset with gloomy wood, Sprawling he lay along, in midst of his warme purple blood. And yet his breath was not quite gone, though fr? his deadly wo?d, Through floods of goare, that streamde from thence, his scalding sighes were drownd. Death him consumde, griefe for loue him kilde, thus twise he dide, His paines aboue all passions were, that did such pangs abide From his sadeyes, the limbecks wet, of sorrow did distill, Such store of teares, as all the place, with water they did fill. His heauie grones, his endlesse sighes, that came his teares betwixt, His luke-warme blood, that with the moysture of his eyes was mixt. Of his laments most dolorous, the onely witnesse were, And those hard Rocks, which curteous then; retolde what they did heare. Bus now that haplesse Stella, many times prooued had, And that she Cloridan did finde, in this estate so bad. She straight-waies (sownding) falls on him, and liuelesse so was seene, As the poore Shepheard thought forthwith, that (quite) dead she had bene. Which when he saw (although nigh dead as then) was his faire Corse, And that in him, through want of blood, remaind small strength or force. Though death had (now) within his power, his sense already brought, And that he iustly angrie was, gainst Stella, as he thought. Thinking (but wrongfully alas) that she had done him wrong, And though he felt his weakenesse such, as liue he could not long. Yet at the last Loue vanquisht him, and pattie him ore-came, Now gins he loue that beautie which, before he did disdaine. Remorse of Conscience toucheth him, and tells him in his minde, (Which he repents) that he hath vsde his Ladie too vnkinde. Although his thought (that she herselfe abusde hath) doth him tell, Yet neuerthelesse, he honoreth her, and now he loues her well. Which is the cause, with armes, though weake, he seekes to make a shift, And trieth if her (sore languishing) he from the ground can lift. He openeth her faire eyes, and forc't through Cupids proud command, He kisseth them ten thousand times, whilst senslesse she doth stand. O God, how rich and puissant is Loue, and of what great power? All former iniuries, to make him cancell, at this hower? Desire for to reuenge his wrongs, (as Louers wont to vse, He now abhors with such bad meanes, himselfe (hee'le) not abuse. Hee'le rather die, then offer wrong to his disloyall Dame, Minding in death to honor her, and to conceale the same. Softly he rubs her liuelesse face, oft kissing her faire lippes, And (being deadly sicke, from them dead almost) life he sippes. Her fore-head he doth water, with his brinish teares that flowe, Her fore-head, father of his griefe, and motlue of his woe. Thus whilst he ouer her doth mourne, Stella gins to reuiue, Wondring that Cloridon she sees, againe to be aliue. Who feeling now his senses faile, and life to fleete full fast, With hollow voyce, and throtling throate, he spake these speeches last. Ah Stella, Ist thou whom I haue lou'de, then mine eyes more deare Ist thou, that dost before me in this pittions plight appeare? Ist thou ingratefull cruell wench, whom I doe see here lye Hard by my side, whilst for thy sake, I doe vniustly die? Ist that bright Diamond eye of thine, that wounded hath my hart That eye, that gainst all reason, makes me reuerence my smart? Ist that faire Forehead (yet forsworne) and those gold haires of thine, That haue bene enemies to me, and to all good of mine? Ah Stella, what hast done, thy faith (alas) why didst thou breake? So dearely prised on my side, through yeelding ouer-weake? Why hast thou falsly left thy Spouse, thy loyall Cloridon? And entertained in his stead (on suddaine) Aridon? Since at the first, thou (willing) me, and vnconstrained tooke, No reason t'is that now sans cause, I should be (thus) forsooke. Thou hauing then abused me (to tell) how, I abhorre, Hast thou the face, and darest thou, to come my face before? Alas, should I permit thee? Or, should I now banish thee? As periurde wretch, whom I doe finde, mine ouerthrow to bee? LOVE and the Heauens, for witnesses, against thee doe I craue: If whilst I liu'd, I any way, myselfe abused haue? My faith and vowe, plighted to thee, I alwayes haue conserude, My loyaltie thou prooued hast, of thee it well deserude. Not any, but thine onely selfe alone, I loued still, And now I die, (O spite) to hate thee, I haue not the will. Yet hast thou falsified thy Faith, and gone from thy first word, Whilst (for true loue) false fained loue to me thou dost afford But, haue I so ill merited, and Aridon so well? That thou shouldst entertaine him, and me thou shouldst expell? Ah, I haue seene, that with mine eyes, in such vndecent sort, As cause that they haue seene too much; they now are All-amort. I haue thee seene kisse Aridon, false Aridon vniust, Whilst to caresse him (as thou didst) my hart in twaine did burst. Disloyally through periurie, thy Faith thou broken hast, Thine Honor lyeth in the dust, and thy good Name is past. Thy glorie through inconstancie, hath caught her deadly wound. Thy credit stained is, nor more it can be healed sound. Who euer would imagine once, or euer would haue thought, That one so faire a beautie would, so fowle a deed haue wrought? Whoeuer would haue had suspect, an eye so full of loue, So full of infidelitie, vnconstantly would proue? Ah say (discurteous too vnkinde) why hast thou me deceiu'd? This thy false show of Amitie, hath me of life bereau'd. For not my death t'is I lament, nor much of that I waide, If thou hadst not my meaning chast, and honest minde betraide. Had I not found thee mutable, vnconstant, wauering bad, Not lingered, nor languished in life, I so much had. This mischiefe, that thou false art found, and double in thy hart, Doth gaull my soule, worse thousand times, then deaths most keenest dart. But yet although thou hast to me, this iniurie procur'de, Although thy loue to me is found, immodest and periur'd. Yet now I die, I loue thee still, though I t'is am abusde, My death yet shall dispence with thee, and thou shalt be excusde. Love that at first me vnto thee in bands most strict aid binde, Commands me (on alleageance mine) with thee no fault to finde. Then iudge if I did honour thee, whilst I did liue on earth, Sence (dying now) I doe the same, and will doe after death. And since it is thy will sweet soule, that I shall leaue this place, Why doth such outrage offer now, vnto thy beautious face? Ift be thy will, that I shall die, and that to haue me dead, Me and thy selfe in subtill wise thou hast dishonoured. Why sobst and sighest, why with fist doest beate thy tender brest, To see (as thou desir'st) that I be freed from this vnrest. Ah leaue to shed teares thus for me, (now good) thy selfe appease. To see this sight torments me more, and more doth me disease. Weepe not for me, vnworthie I, that thou for me shouldst waile, Since those thine eies, once my chiefe blisse, are now become my baile, Nor seeeme thou thus to grieue for him, or aught for him to mourne. Who (not thy loue deseruing) dieth, because he was forlorne. No, no (aissembling wretch) thou doest not weepe for death of mine, Yetfore I part let me once kisse those daintie lips of thine. Let me (dying) but kisse those eies, although I not deserue, Which for to light me to my Tombe, in steed of torch shall serue. What wilt thou not grace me so much, this fauour wilt not graunt? To haue obtaind so much at my last gaspe, shall I not vaunt? Dost thou denie to suffer me to tast of that sweet good, Which heretofore I oft haue had within this darkesome wood? When our sacred mariage rights consummated with oth, Vowing one to the other faith, and to be constant both. Why doest refuse me (cruell) since I die through heauie griefe, Whilst dying, thou'lt not to my paine ad debut some small reliefe? Stella, this hearing vext in soule, perplexed with strange paine. Once more vpon her faithfull Swaine, doth fall on sound againe. She falleth downe vpon his brest, her bodie senselesse is, When fainting Cloridan begins afresh her for to kisse. And now what's true he doubts, and thinkes he was deceiued right, Cursing his follie ouerbold, and bating his best sighs. He cannot thinke that Stella was with any one vntrue, When he doth see how pitiously she taketh on anewe. So oft to fall in Traunse, so eft such Corsiues to endure, Which makes him curse his tongue, such woes that to her did procure. But in the end she to her selfe againe comes, when with cries And pittious plaints she breaketh forth thus, in lamenting wise. O death, sweet death, why vnto me doest not such fauour shew. As for to end my course my soule and time, all with one blow. Alas, why so long doest permit her for to breath and liue, Who liueth not, whilst languishing she more and more doth griefe. O death, why thus to nourish life in me, doest me despite, Who am of all that liue on earth the most accursedst wight, This bodie which polluted it, with worse then worse may be, This bodie which vnworthie is, the heauens, or man to see. This bodie spoild of honour rich, and cloathed now with shame. (Although my minde did neuer yet consent vnto the same) This bodie which deserues from graue and buriall to be bard, The mocke of Fortune, and the tipe of punishment most hard. This bodie which with mine owne hand, in peeces I should tare. This bodie which for to be burnt to ashes worthie were. Ah cursed bodie, hast thou staind thy soule without recure, And (guiltlesse of this ill) must thou eternall paines endure? Hast thou thy credit lost, thy honour hast thou blemished? Defamde thy Spouse, and Traitor bene vnto thy Lord and head? Thou shalt be plagued for the same, of death thou shalt not misse, Yet death's too good for such a sinne, too milde a paine it is. Ah then (sweet friend) why doest it touch, why to it comes thou nigh! Alacke forbeare, infectious tis, it is thine enemie. Vnworthie of thine eies it is, vnworthie of thy face, Nor doth it merit for to haue, the least drop of thy grace. Vouchsafe not for to touch the same, but rather let it perish, Tis it hath sind and murthered thee, the same then doe not cherish. But yet before into the hands of wisht for death I fall, The Gods to witnesse of my truth as records I do call. I call the heauens aboue, the earth, the Seas that flowing shew, The spirits of the firmament, and them of hell below. The Tritons, Siluans, Satirs swift, the Nymphs in Groues that walke, And damned hags, whose gastly shapes strike terror as they talke. In briefe, what so hath life or moues, all Trees, all Rocks, and Caues, All Fountaines, Groues, and shadowing Vales, from parching heat that saves. All these as witnesses I call, that I am culpable, But yet deceiu'd most traiterously and so made miserable. All these I call, and doe coniurd, that know me innocent, Vnwittingly I faulted haue, yet neuer did consent. My faith I neuer brake to thee (my Spouse) I here a vow, This (heauens yee know for truth) for I did thinke that it was thou. I thought twas thou (as thou wert wont) that thou hast hid my face, (My face that is the cause that thou art in this wofull case) Vnwilling though my bodie is tainted, yet pure's my minde, My bodie, which against his will, thy shadow false did finde. But yet tis faultie and deserues (and righly too) reward, Since it thine ouerthrow hath wrought, through Fortune ouer hard. Twise (then) it thee offended hath, and double wrought thy woe, Alas, that double for to die, I cannot force it tho. The greatest sorrow I sustaine, of these my sorrowes all, Is, that I double cannot die, nor twise by dying fall. Then why shouldst thou desire (sweet hart) new friendship to begin With such a bodie, as but late doth come from doing sinne? Vnworthie tis for thee, the earth, grosse earth, let that it couer, A fitting spoyle tis for the same; and not for any other. Or rather let this carkasse vile, be purged pure with fire, And th'ashes be disperst abroad, through windes as I desire. Woe is me borne was I to be thy death, and through hard hap, By my bad meanes, the Parce three haue caught thee in their trap Tis I, and none but I, that kild thee haue (my dearest Spouse) Tis I that death haue brought to thee, and that most dangerous. Thou diest for my fault, O cruell Lawe, and most vnciuill, He that is guiltlesse, bides the paines of her that hath done euill. Tis I that blood haue drawne from thee, tis I thy hart haue split, Tis I that haue thy louing name, amongst the dead soules writ. It is not death (as thou dost thinke) thy life that shortned hath, But tis thy Stella, haplesse borne to doe thee ill and skath. Then to thy selfe I doe appeale, if death I not deserue, And how much fortune mine accurst, from other Fortunes swerue When as (instead of honouring thee) dishonoured thee I haue, And when I life to thee should giue, I bring thee to thy graue. When as our sacred Hymen, I should reuerence and adore, I haue abusde, disparaged, and scandalisde it sore. And lastly, when with ioy thou shouldest thy youth with pleasure passe, I doe vntimely cut thee off, and make thee vade like grasse. I being then, the cause of all this mischiefe, and this all, Doest seeme to wonder though I weepe, and heauens with sorrow fall? Haue I not reason to lament, to sigh, to waile, and grone, Like vnto Niobe, till like to her I turne to stone? Since first the skies were fram'd, and Sunne to shine, at first, was seene, More wretched woman than my selfe, nere was, nor ere hath beene. O wofull Stella, Cloridan, O Cloridan, my life, My life shall expiat my fault, to end these sorrowes rife. That selfe same sword that wounded thee, shall through my bodie rome, Whilst dying both together, we will laid be in one Tombe. Then pardon me sweet Cloridan, for pittie pardon mee. Since that through others treacherie, I haue offended thee. Adieu my Lord, I loath to liue, and not thy selfe enioy, And saying so, her selfe, she (strait) doth with his sword destroy. O braue Virago, glorie and renowme of women kinde, Fewe like thy selfe, thy selfe like fewe, didst shew a worthie minde. O vertuous Ladie, O faire spirit, of thy selfe, conquerour, Ore whose rare constancie, nor sword, nor death it selfe had power. So Lucres dide, the Romanes Pearle, when by base treacherie, She vndefilde, defiled was, through Tarquin, forceablie. So Hero dide, so Thisbe with the selfesame sword did slay Her selfe, when Piramus to seeke, she went the haplesse way. And now her breathlesse coarse did fall vpon the pouer Swaine, Who with that burthen gan to breath, and seeke some life againe. As when the night approacheth, we behold and view the Sunne, By little and by little steale from hence, his race being done. His colour lesneth, and lookes pale, disdaining that still tide, Whilst in some corner of the skie, his faire face he doth hide. So that vermillion colour sweet of Stella (but of yore,) That beautie boue suparlatiue (as sacred to adore.) That passing snow white Iuorie, that did all thoughts controule, By little and by little, forth from out her bodie stole. Ore that ?same? louely coarse of hers, death sits predominant, Who (for that he came there) for Rose, and Lillie fresh did want. Pale looked now those cherrie lips, like ashes they appeare, Whilst with an iron sleepe shut vp, her eies fast closed were. Her armes hung downe (Sans motion) and like a picture faire, Which (liuelesse) is in colours wrought; resemblance, so she bare. The wofull Shepheard when this sight most dolorous he spide, Afresh his plaints he doth renew, and out aloud he cride. Kissing this liuelesse coarse, and dying, he seekes himselfe to ease, Whilst (her embracing) he doth thinke, her griefes somewhat t'appease, His sight he wistly fixeth on her face, and on her eies, And like a mad man he takes on, in most outragious wise, Yet he to Stella listneth still, who still doth him require, And pray to pardon her foule fault, this oneli's her desire. And as she giueth vp the ghost, she forth these words doth groue, Ah pardon me, sweet pardon me, the most distressed one. Sweet Cloridan forget, forgiue poore Stella for her ill, She did offend, but knew it not, it was against her will. Oh, in one Tombe let me with thee (sweet friend) be buried, Gods lawes command to pardon such as doe offend (being dead.) Farewell deare Spouse, and graunt to me, but this my last request, Farewell, for death to seaze on me, I feele alreadie prest. Ile meete thee in the Lizian fields, and then I will thee knowe, Once more farewell my Cloridan, for now from thee I goe. So saying, she doth breath her last, as any stone she is cold, Yet closely in his feeble armes, the Shepheard doth her hold. But when that he had bleeding left, which like a spring did come From forth his brest, and mongst the blood of his faire Stella runne. He laieth her softly downe by him, her eies he then doth close, And by her side placing himselfe, vnto his end he growes. And hauing cried out full oft, as one accursed most, That he was author of her death, he giueth vp his ghost. Whilst by his warme blood, and salt teares, he seeketh to appease, His Ladies spirit late gone from thence, to liue with greater ease. A thousand times he saith farewell, sweet Stella, still he cride, And in the end, in selfe same sort (as Stella did) he dide. Their bodies twaine, which whilst they liude, had but one soule alone, Were buried both together, shut within one Tombe and stone. And Aridon that Traitor curst, who these two Louers paind, By iustest punishment of Gods, into a Rocke was changd. Which Iupiter doth oftentimes scourge for his former sin, With thunder-bolts, breaking his top, and all to battering him Then let no Louer once presume vnlawfull meanes to seeke, But be resolued to be content, as shall their Ladies leeke. Forforced Loue or treacherie will nere proue well at all, Which if they vse, worse plagues shall them, then Aridon befall. [The glorious heauens we praise in goodly wise] The glorious heauens we praise in goodly wise, Because the Gods doe lodge within that place: So you that hold sweet beautie in your eies, And honour in your soule, haue fairer grace. Then who to glorie yours, can silence giue, When (than the heauens) it is farre more diuine: Heauens perish, but vertuous spirits alwaies liue, Glorie shall flourish still, and so shall thine. Then at your feet, we hang this verse of ours, Whilst, vnder shade of thousand Lawrells greene, We of your virtues will discourse whose powers No Tempests rage (to feare) shall ere be seene. Since Pans faire Sisters, to you honour yeeld, Since this our Song your vertues doe sigh forth: And since all Lawrells doe your forhead shield, Vouchsafe thereof, though tis of little worth. [If nothing faire I see, but whats thy face] If nothing faire I see, but whats thy face, If brightnes thine, the day is, of mine eies, If vertue thine, I doe (as Gods) embrace, Haue I not reason (then) in dutious wise, Thy gratious selfe for to implore, Since thee (as Goddesse) I adore? Who finds a salue to cure him of his griefe, By friendly hand, of that shall he not make Account? when he thereby may get reliefe, Whereby his sicknesse from him he may shake? The wounded Deare, to the hearbe doth go, Which can him helpe as be doth know. So then, in this my worse then Captiues state, These lines I offer to thy Deitie, Not doubting, but (though haplesse be my fall) I, from thy selfe, shall find some remedie. Of thee I beg some grace to haue, In thee of health, to spill or saue. Who dieth for want of succour or remorse, Doth not deserue or merrit any blame: But such as by their owne power and their force, May wretches helpe, yet let them take their bane Such doe deserue punisht to bee, Of Gods and men, in highest degree. Another. [(Dian) thou shin'st in heauens with Maiestie] (Dian) thou shin'st in heauens with Maiestie, In hell below, likewise thou doest command: And in the earth, thou raignest gloriously, Ah then (if I am thine) let me so stand. Slaues to immortall Essence are we all, And them we honour must, though gainst our will: Doest aske (Diuine) then how this doth befall, How I dare loue thee? I must loue thee still. The sacred skies are made for to adore, What that resembleth, we must worship too: For mortall men haue life from them therefore. And vnto them we reuerence ought to doe. Then if thy power, breath to my soule doth giue, Ah then conserue the same; for I am bound Most strictly thee to honour, whilst I liue, And whilst I tred vpon this earthly ground. (Deare) a presumption let not this be thought In me, to serue thee (though a thing of nought.) ECCO. O that the Gods of these huge Woods, would shew me fauour such, But for to heare my Fortunes hard, ore Fortunate by much. O that they would but marke, how I doe nought but waile and crie, I doubt not then, but they their eares, would lend mee by and by. Might I but them so courteous finde, to listen to my mone, I would adore and honor still, their Maiesties each one. Then with a voyce like Lightning flash, I soone would thunder forth, And shewe with sighing in my verse, their bountie and their worth. Of them alone, then would I sing, and of their great renowne, Whist that my tongue should neuer linne, but still their praises sowne. Their kindnesse, my soule vnto them should binde in, to be so fast, As nere I would forget the same, as long as life should last. Ah then shall I obtaine of Mistris mine this happie Boone, To yeeld me liking? when will shee? will it be long, or soone? ECCO. Soone. What may I hope for, when I thus fight vnder Cupids Banner? Whilst I consume my selfe thereby, and worke mine owne dishoner? ECCO. Honer. What may I of my FAIRE expect? when as the Gods I finde, To crosse me in my amorous sute, vnlesse she will be kinde? ECCO. She will be kinde. Who is of power this gloomy Cloud from off mine eyes to moue? And to repaire my late fallen helpe, quite ruined by Loue? ECCO. Loue. Then, ist not hee that courteously after our grieuous woe, Our Fancie brings to happie Port, I now perceiue t'is so. ECCO. T'is so. But are the gentle Heauens content, importunde without cries To yeeld to vs poore worldly wights, our wish in courteous wise? ECCO. In courteous wise. If so, what shall become of that quicke Fire, which burnes so bright, Within my bowels languishing, shal't be extinguisht quite? ECCO. Extinguisht quite. What shall become of this mine ill? (which in my Coarse doth stay, Shall it increase my farther care, or shall it soone away? ECCO. Soone away. Shall I, for any good (ere) hope, to come from her (my griefe,) Who holds my heart fast tide, and plagues my soule without reliefe? ECCO. Reliefe. Say then, hath Loue acquainted yet, my Mistris cruell Hart, With this my woes, hath she as yet, felt (of my paines) some part? ECCO. Some part. Then (sacred Gods) Ile hope the best, and as an Oracle, Ile looke one day, that this to mee, may fall out veritable. Not doubting but that fore I die, I may that sweete fruit reape, In Ioy, which I haue sowne long since, in anguish and in sweate. Meane time, with these your answeres kinde, Ile satisfide returne, Assuring me, through fauours yours, I shall giue ore to mourne. For whilst your comfortable beames shall shine vpon me bright, My hart shall liue (freed from all feare) enfrancht from danger quite. Then (heauenly Powers) remember what your promise is to me, Who trust repose in you, that I deceiued may not be. If men are taxt, for Faith not kept, you merit farre more blame, Since you our deeds brightly adorne, as glistering Sunny flame. [What should I waile thus, weepe, and make those outcries?] What should I waile thus, weepe, and make those outcries? If my misfortunes, (where themselues they should drowne) Burne their most hote selues, hotter farre, then burneth Thicke smoaking Ætna. Thrise wofull Louer euerlasting wretched, Who still doth languish heavily (sans comfort) And neuer hope can, but to liue in sorrow Vntill his life end. Farre better were it neuer for to be borne, Then to be alwayes cruelly afflicted With such a plague, as hourely more and more doth Growe and increase still. What crosse a man is subiect to by Destinie, (Withouten hope) is sure nere to be holpen. Nor doth it leaue him, till that hee be forced For to leaue lifes terme. Then (prithee) sweet death, come away and end me, Come, and abridge the number of my bad daies, Nor canst thou blam'd be for to kill a bodie Wanting a liue soule. Thou that cuttest off so many of our crosses. (Courteous) come, come dispatch me quickly, He cannot liue, but in exceeding anguish That his owne life hates. There is not anything but hath his ending, And what is mortall, hath not here long biding, (once) But yet my wounds growe more and more, nor death Seekes for to change them. None will (so much) as pittie on me take (now,) Nor on my fancie too too dearely purchast, All (sauing sorrowes) in the lash doe leaue me, I being at worst. Thus without dying, doe I vade and perish, Thus flow sower salt teares from mine eies for euer, Whilst that the heauens scoffe at these my crosses, And my faire euill. But if, immortall Cupid be, and mightie, Able to vanquish men and soueraigne Gods too, Why then my soule (now) heales he not? He cannot, Onely my Loue can. But she (ore cruell) too too much deceiues me, Not from her (as yet) any succour find I, Balme for my sore, she yeelded not vnto me, But my decay seekes. Yet tis my hope, that Cupid (as the last) will Venge on her my death, for her ouer proud hart. Oft such deceitfull dames (as she) haue loued, Yet neuer are lou'd. Loue often striketh as he passeth by, blind, And hurts the best; as well as basest persons, Venus is witnesse, Mirrha so, and Dido, Who slewe her owne selfe. And yet before (thus) Mistris mine should plagu'd be, I pray (yee Gods all) let my soule from hence flit, Fore I endure to see that any ill should Vnto her happen. Too well (to wish them ill) her eies I doe loue, And too too carefull am I, of her welfare, I onely studie, how I best might please her, Though to mine owne paine. He that (indeed) loues, rather had he hazard For to die desprate, thousand times, and thousand, Than for to veiw his Ladie liue in anguish, Making her end so. [Trust (now) no more] Trust (now) no more, Yee mortals poore, The Gods aboue, Their wonted grace, From you they chase, Nor you they loue. They doe despise, Our sighes and cries, And we them iest: All pittie milde, They haue exilde, From out their brest. Their Altars proud, No hope doth shroud, Of good to come: And when we pray, As deafe they stay, Seeming right dumme. Then sillie Swaine, And Shepheard plaine, Else where goe crane, Fonds he that mones, To stocks and stones, Himselfe to saue. Elsewhere declare, Thy wofull care, And leaue the skies: Thy wofull plaints, Thy hart that taints, They doe despise. The heauens looke red, With rage are spred, And horrour toe: Tis they, is griefe, Without reliefe, That vs vndoo. He is a sot, That thinketh not, That from that place, Through destinie, Most wretchedly, Comes our disgrace. Then better tis, For death to wish, And end our daies, Then still in strife, Lead such a life, So plagude alwaies. For death's our friend, When he doth end Our bitter smart: And through the same, Doth rid our paine. With his keene dart. [Now that Boreus with his cold] Now that Boreus with his cold Doth this Countrie round infold, And his Isicles displaies, Whilst the Verdure greene he slaies, We must end our life ere long, And shut vp our mournfull song. Now that more than cruell paine, Brings our hopes for to be vaine, And that Loue makes vs distill, Salt teares (sigrnes of ou kind will) Needs we must our liues tearme end, Vnto t'heauens to ascend. Now that such is our sad care, As of helpe we helplesse are. That crosse Fates seekes vs to grieue, Why should we desire to liue? Better tis to die, than still Follow what workes vs more ill. Now that sighes, and sobs, and teares, The subiects of our verses beares. And whilst this plague gaines our hart, Let vs likewise make it smart. By a death that one day may, Make vs victor euery way. Now that skies with lightnings blast, Forct our pleasures not to last. And that Sunne no more doth shine. We must yeeld to tempests time. (Loyall we) will lay vs downe, And goe (willing) to our Tombe. Now that cold and chillie feare, Haunts vs gastly euerie where. Seeke we must, by crueltie, For to end our miserie. For an end to euery thing, Gentle death (none else) doth bring. Now that burning fire ore bright Hath our soules consumed quite. Leauing nought with vs but groanes, Lets our selues rid all at once. Dying, lets our courage proue, Oenon like for Paris loue. [Tuta frequensq; via est, per amici fallere nomen] Tuta frequensq; via est, per amici fallere nomen, Tuta frequensq; licet sit via, crimen habet. The safe and surest way it is By friendship to deceiue: Though safe and surest way it be, T'is knauerie by your leaue. [Who euer saw, but that a Louer vaine] Who euer saw, but that a Louer vaine, Conceales his griefe, nor dares bewray his paine? [For can poore men, with their weake feeble power] For can poore men, with their weake feeble power, The force of Gods crosse, when they gin to lower? [Concealeth still (within his brest) his paine] Concealeth still (within his brest) his paine Nor, (but to Mistris his) will tell the same. [Her speech was gone, pale, earthly, was her sight] Her speech was gone, pale, earthly, was her sight, A stone (not liuing creature) seemd she right. [All ioy he bids adue, all hope farewell] All ioy he bids adue, all hope farewell, No longer now in sorrow, he will dwell. [Thus Heauens make proue, that profitable oft] Thus Heauens make proue, that profitable oft, Which mortall men account of, as of nought. [The wicked still, heape sinne (like Hills) on sinne] The wicked still, heape sinne (like Hills) on sinne, So long, till they their Soules doe soyle within. [Blest is he that nere did proue] Blest is he that nere did proue False in Faith, in all his Loue. Loue (without fidelitie,) Is a plague, that makes vs die. Without Faith, one sues in vaine, Loue of beautie faire to gaine. Blest is he, that nere did proue, False in faith, in all his Loue. Beautie soone, away passe will, Sacred Faith continueth still. Th'ones diuine, and nere deceiues, Th'other oft our hearts bereaues. Blest is he, that nere did proue, False in Faith, in all his Loue. Without Faith, Loue could not be, For through Faith (aie) liueth he. Who a Louer's, and not true, Louers name to him's not due. Blest is he, that nere did proue, False in Faith, in all his Loue. Oh how sweet a thing it is, Two to loue, and faith not misse. Tis two soules in one to bind, Whilst daies (turned to nights) they find. Blest is he, that nere did proue, False in Faith, in all his Loue. [Though light as Feather yet a burthen great I beare] Though light as Feather yet a burthen great I beare, And liue within the lappe of my chiefe enemie, One while I shake, and nod, as if a sleepe I were, Another white as swift as flight, away goe I. Light though I am, I (often) heauie armed men Carrie, and am their faithfull friend and saue their (wealth, Yet (with my selfe) I cast away them, now and then, And (many times) through swiftnes mine I saue my selfe. But after I, in many a place haue serud their turne, And old become, they throw me strait into the fire, Whilst, I (of cold) growe hot, and in the flame doe burne, To serue these men, loe here, you see my goodly hire. For all my labour (done to them) in pieces they me spoile, And hauing done th? seruice good, I am nought worth, &amp; vile. The end of the third daies meeting of Iuliettaes Shepheards. THE FOVRTH DAYES MEETING, OF IVLIETTAES SHEPHEARDS. SONNET. [Come, and approach, and heare my cries, you Hagges, and Hob-goblings] Come, and approach, and heare my cries, you Hagges, and Hob-goblings, And doe receiue in gree, my heauie plaintes, and abuse. Vnto your cruell fatall Sisters, nought doe I profer, For, I (no more) life haue, t'is, with my griefes ouerdead. LOVE, that hath tooke my loyall Hart, for a pawne euerlasting, (Gagd'e, for my Truth) is dead, splitted in euery part. Whilst, to an auncient Elme, I seeme like one that is, Spoylde with Lightnings blast, when (but the roote) doth remaine (O kinde Death) all mortall woes, who makest an end of me, In this my chiefe pangs, thee doe I call, mee to helpe. (Sweet) let me die, through thee, that then, I truely report may, LOVE hath wounded my heart. (Death) of my paine, make an end, Onely (in thee) is my hope, a hope, God knowes very slender, Nought hope I in my cares, but, for to dye out of hand: Dye would I rather, then in woes lie, (still for to languish, Blest is the soule that departs, when that he cannot be curd'e. But you, mine eyes are accurst, to haue seene my Ladie so cruell, Since that disloyaltie, hath (to me) done such a wrong, Well had it bene for you, if, with a night euerlasting, Shut had you bene alwayes, your proper death not to see. That so sacred Light, you are neuer like for to see more, Which did reuiue my spirits, when that they first were in thrall. Sweet should I (then) count my miserie, comparde to my bad hap, If that the world I might leaue, as in my minde I doe wish. Sigh'd haue I, more then a thousand times, yet she with her hard hart, Is no more mollified, then in the Seas is a Rocke: More doe I pray, more doth she say nay, for all mine intreating, Whilst that her lookes are so sower, as they my woes make the more. SONNET I. [More hard then Rocks, I feele my Martyrs hard] More hard then Rocks, I feele my Martyrs hard, The flinty Rocke, the chisell doth endure: Yet nought but death, from hurt can me award, So great's mine ill, which is without recure. Yee heauenly Gods, cast Lightnings on my face, As on the Mounts of Epire, or consume Mee Phœnix like, reuiuing (in a space) For I, (in Loue) a Phœnix am become, Too much I haue abid, then from these eyes, Since you haue drawne forth fountains of salt teares, So many sighes, from heart, let it suffise, Nothing so strong, but sorrow (quickly) weares. Each thing, (except my selfe) with change doth mend, (Yet see my cruell Destenie) I am still, In paine, and yet my paine doth neuer end. Liuing, I die, though (dying) I doe liue, This is the fauour, my FAIRE doth me giue, SONNET. II. [What may it be, my Mistris should me scorne] What may it be, my Mistris should me scorne So much, as not on mee vouchsafe to looke? Was I then vnder such hard Planet borne, As that my sicknes strange, no Salue can brooke? That Beautie which, so often doth me wound, Those sacred eyes (Authors) of all my smart: Kill mee, when I, to looke on them, am found, Nor helpe they me, as I, to death depart. What Destenie then, may change this mine ill hap? What alteration may my griefes appease? I, ill Fortune, in such sorrowes doth me wrap, As (though they would) yet mee they cannot ease. For shee that is, of torments mine the sourse, More sacred is, then heauens, and more diuine: Fierce Destinie, and Fortune (in her course) She doth commaund, and with her beck combine. Then, to this Goddesse, must I seeke alone, To cure my mortall wound, or else to none. [What? shall my Fortune neuer mend, in which I doe languish?] What? shall my Fortune neuer mend, in which I doe languish? Yet (O yee Gods) let me die, for liue without heart, can I not now. Cruell he, that my soule commaunds, doth mocke at my hard haps, Curst be the flame, that euery thing doth burne saue our anguish. Ah, shall I neuer see, my life nor my Loue to be ended? Neuer; for these skies are cruell vnto my plainings. And they doe seeme to be deafe, when with my cries I doe moue them, More, that I liue, I plague my selfe, and am mine owne Hangman. Cruell (alone) is that griefe, that no remedie findeth, But for to suffer (without hope) if destinie mine were. Why was I brought into this world, and why was I borne then? Better (nere) to be, than alwaies so to be tortred. Woe to me, hope haue I none, that ere my paine will be swaged, Yet no griefe there is to be found, but findeth his easing: Excepe such, as ouer desperate, onely by Loue comes. Then since I needes must languish thus, content will I hold me. For (at last) my comforts this, although that I perish, Yet from all these cares and troubles soone shall I rid me. That man neuer feares, when death doth venter vpon him, When to loose this wretched life, he rides in a Hauen, Free from the Tempests of this world, to liue euerlasting. [Yee hollow Rocks be witnesses, what here by me is sed] Yee hollow Rocks be witnesses, what here by me is sed, Within whose gloomie horror darke, the night is shadowed. Yee stately Rocks, to powder burnt, oftimes most cruelly, When Ioue, your tops with thunderbolts, doth scortch and bruse, from skie: Ah be your witnesses of this my sad discourse ile tell You, which of late the loues of these two Shepheards ouerwell Conceiude; of these two louing wights, whose lucklesse hap ile show, Vndone by Loue, by Loue who dares the Gods to ouerthrow? And ye broad Beeches, in your shade that often haue them seene, When they reposing of themselues vnder the same haue beene. You, which a thousand of endless letters caru'd, within your tender rinde, (Knots and deuises in their loue) and such like Toyes may finde. You darksom Caues, where whilst the day did last in brightsome wise, They (blushing) of their chastest Loues did mongst themselues deuise. Yee prettie Foordes and christall springs, yee Riuers murmerous, Who at the sigh of them became for to be amorous. Yee vncoth Desarts, witnesses, what they in secret did, Importunde by their often plaints, which from you were not hid. And thou, thicke priuate shadowing groue, that knowest most of all, To thee (and all the rest) to heare, what I will speake, I call. Vnto you all (beare witnesse then) I to you all appeale, Since tis as true (as pittifull) what I shall now reueale. In that same time, when mongst the woods, as yet Loue was not knowne, In that same happie golden world, when none through Loue did grone. When Shepheards (free from Cupids darts) as carelesse did remaine, And for to languish were not forc't, through too much amorous paine. But rather not so much as once thinking of this proud Loue, Voide from all ill, themselues sought still, merrie to make, and proue. Whilst wantonly amongst themselues, in ioy they spent the day, And pleasantly to their contents, the time did passe away. Freed from those cares, that Louers haunt, and brings them to their graue, Making them pale, and wearie, fore their youths they passed haue. Then was no wailing there, nor eies that teares doe shed apace, Nor (that they grieued were) could you perceiue ought by their face. Cleerd from all plaints, releast from sighes, not knowing what ment care, They did despise, and eke contemne the Cyprian Goddesse faire. Her cruell Sonne, the very Syre, and father of all vice, Of them Oblations neuer had, nor any Sacrifice. The mighty power of Cupid blinde, (as then) they did not know, Nor what did meane his fire-brands, his Arrowes, and his Bow. Withouten troubling with this Loue, their neuer troubled braine, A kinde of ordinary kindnesse did, mongst them remaine. In merry laughter, and in sport, they spent the soone gone yeare: Their chiefest pleasures, thousand songs, and Madrigals then were. Which they sigh'd forth, with comely grace, whilst bout the flowing banke, Of some cleare riuer, all the Crue of them, themselues encampe. One while they daunced hand in hand, within the Meadowes greene, Another while, bout foote of Rocke, for coolenesse they were seene. (As then) plaintes were not their repasts, nor teares, as drinke to vse, (As Louers wont) who what is ill, still for themselues they chuse. Consuming sorrow did not gnawe, nor gripe them at the hart, Nor was their chiefe reliefe of Death, the penetrable dart. But rather, without carke and care, without malice or strife, As happie soules (in all content) they wore away their life. No palenes was within their cheekes, no hollownesse in eye, Which frighted with a suddaine feare, most pittious you might spie. Nor could you once perceiue as much, as signe of heauie chance, In their well featur'de faces all, and louely countenance. Ah trebble blessed such; For he cannot be said to liue, Who for Death wisheth, that his woes, no more might make him grieue. In steed of pastimes to be blithe, they sounded their shill Crowde, And with a hundred Songs, they fild the Groues with noyses lowde. Whilst their soft instruments, apace (according to their vse) Oftimes well tun'de, and then vntun'de, as they themselues did chuse. A thousand Brawles, and Pastorall Odes, they sung in plainest sort, Whereby (the more) they did increase, their merriment and sport. In coole of day, to daunce (about) you mighten them espie, And when the heate was great, in midst of shadowing Groues to lie. There would they many an olde wiues tale, and iesting Fables tell, Whilst (some of them) to blowe a fresh, their Bagpipes fell. Now vnder cooly Trees they would (friendly) make their repast, Feeding on bread and Mornings milke, for to delight their taste. And dipping in the water cleare, their Hattes, they that did drinke, Which better farre then any wine, (though daintiest) they did thinke. But weladay, the nature of this sauadge inhumane LOVE, Did alter this sweete course of life, and worser made them proue. He chang'de their pastimes into playes, and spoyled so their sense, As (weakening courage theirs) hee forc't them stand without defence. As we doe see amaz'd to stand, the gentle harmles Sheepe, (And that in running here and there) no order they doe keepe. When as at vnawares, the Wolfe, with reuenous mouth them takes, And of them as him liketh best, a bloody slaughter makes. Or as we view the Shepheards from the fields in haste to runne, One here, one there, least that by death, they should be ouercome. When Iupiter, to threat the earth, with which he seemeth wroth, From heauen he, in angrie wise, his Thunder sendeth forth. Making a thousand flashie Lights, (the children of dread Feare) Vnto their frighted eyes, and on their bloodlesse cheeks appeare. Whilst furie of the Thunders hard, with such a suddaine cracke, As one would thinke it were hard by, and euen at his backe. Euen so did LOVE, these Shepheards fray, &amp; trouble to them wrought, Consumde their liues, and chiefest glee, and to their end them brought. And thus it was: Nature had framde one Shepheardesse mongst rest, More perfect then the other all, and fairer then the best. Young was she in experience, and in age, for but as then, She passed had of yeares some fiue, and ioyning to them ten. Yet stature hers so comely was, and full of Maiestie, As for a second Venus her, they did (of right) descrie. Her haire farre brighter then pure gold, in knottes was tyed fine, Empaling round her head most rich, of Princely Crowne the signe. Whilst those her tresses amorous, did genttly moue with winde, As we the calmy waues in Sea, to role and rise doe finde. Her Forhead (heauens sweet mount) was smoothe, by Nature framed faire, No Art (though exquisite) could mend the same, it was so rare. No wrinckle was there to be seene, no frowning in that place, (That) truely got by Beautie was, Beautie gaue it such grace. Her Eyelids, lids of Ebony, inclosed there within, Which Gods and Men amazed made, and euery hart did win. Her sparkling eyes, two starres did shew, then Lightning far more bright, More cleare then glorious Sunne, when he doth shew his chiefest light. Eyes, which who so presum'd to dare, their lookes for to behold, They soone were strucken blinde as t'were, for being ouerbold. Eyes where as LOVE in all his pride, did seeme for to repose, And through the sparklings of the which, lies chiefest honors rose. Eyes, which as sacred and diuine, all did adore and feare, Although to euery one their fall, and ouerthrow they were. Her Cheekes that checkt greatst Potentates: which Beautie beautifide, Of ruddie Rose, and Lillie white, the equall combat tryde. Her Cheekes vermillion colloured, by Nature, not through Art, The perfect Type of louelinesse, to each one did impart. Her witching lippe was Currall white, like to a Gilliflower: Which watred was in pearly deaw, most supple euery hower. And as her Lippes, so was her Mouth, her mouth like Orakell, From which, a speech forth came, that did Pallas (though wise) excell. Her Lippes inuiting to sweet sport, did grace her dimpled chinne, Whose sight was such, as was enough (in thought) to make vs sinne. Her snowy Throat was seemely plac'te, so was her sweatlesse Neck, Which whitest Marble of the Alps, and Porphery did check. Her matchlesse Throat so delicate, her daintie Skinne so cleare, As through the same, what so she dranke, the coulour did appeare. Her beautous Breasts, LOVES lobbie right, right way to Paradice: Where grewe those golden Apples rare, vnvalued for their price. Two Mountaines there were plac'te, from whence an amorous sweet fire, Did send forth sighes (children of Care, begotten through Desire.) Her slender Middle like a Spanne, did shewe her waste so small, Which who so lookt on, as he lookt, he languisht therewithall. Next was that place, (Alas, that of that Place, I may not showe) Vnworthie we, such Mysteries and such rare sights to knowe. Her hands were white, as Whale his bone, so matchelesse was her foote, The first whereof, were Arrowes, which Dan Dupid vsde to shoote. Then such this wonderous Beautie was, of this faire Shepheardesse. Who many a Shepheards hart did charm, &amp; wroght them much distresse. Her name was FLORA (FAIRE, surnam'd) well worthy of that name And worthie was that name of her, so glorious was her Fame. Her exercise, and vse (as then) was bout the Fields to walke, And chiefest pleasure which she tooke, in shadowy Groues to stalke, Whilst (as her harmlesse flocke did feede) about them she did sing, (Full merilie) some pleasant Round, which made the woods to ring. For spitefull LOVE (as yet) had not his malice gainst her bent, Nor had he (yet) through his deuise, spoylde this worke excellent. Free was shee from a Louers life, from amorous annoy: With libertie (most pleasantly) her youth she did enioy. But (soone this humor for to change) she gainst her will was forc't: (Compeld to Loue) from her hearts ease, (poore soule) she was diuorc't. For, by her dwelt a goodly Swaine, that did increase her care, A valiant Shepheard, gallant and louely, as she was faire. Borne on the selfe-same day, that she into this world was borne, And subiect, by the selfe-same chaunce) vnto this fatall storme. Hight NVMIDOR, he cleaped was, both affable and kinde, So courteous and so debonnaire, as like you could not finde. In feature, shape, and comelinesse, Adonis he did passe: And (if hee did not him exceed) his equall (sure) he was. Each morning, when the breake of day began for to appeare, He vsed to accompanie, his FLORA, loued deare. Vnto the Meadowes with her Flocke, and there with her would chat, In friendly wise, as they did walke, of this, and then, of that. And afterwards, they both would set them downe, or in some shade, Of some thicke Pinetree, or by Foord, which trickling murmure made. There would he eate of vittailes hers, and she on his would feed, Whilst (what they had emongst themselues) as common, they decreed. When any sport commenced was, mongst Shepheards she was found, The first that led the Daunce with him, and he began the Round. No sooner was it night, but they, together home did goe: And in franke manner one of th'other, Gifts vsde to bestowe. These pretie sports, were but a light (as t'were) more strong to tie, And to begin to binde them in, more perfect Amitie. And yet this plaine and simple kinde of Courting (though plaine stuffe) To set their harmlesse harts on fire, too much t'was, and enough. Since LOVE we see engendred is, only by looks and speach: And so continueth through the same, beyond all humane reach, This was the cause that manie woes they did endure, Of Friends, they loyall Louers did, become most firme and sure. As both their Birth-dayes were but one, so was their Loues but one: Equall they in affection were: and loue they did alone. One minde there was betweene them both, two bodies, but one soule, One Conquerour, both of their harts, and fancies did controle. What one did wish, the other would (alike) was their Desire: If th'one did burne through heate, the other did feele as great a fire. If th'one did send forth pittious plaints, with many a drery teare, The other for to waile with sighes, and sobbes, did not forbeare. No loue, like hers, so passionate, so loyall (ere) hath bene, Anchises loue, with Venus faire, so constant was not seene. Nor Pyramus, may I compare, vnto these Louers true, Although so deare his Dame hee lou'd, as that himselfe he slue. In euery Rocke and Tree, they did ingraue the houre and day, In which LOVE (cunningly) had wrought, to bring them to his bay. In midst of Groues, and thickie Woods, cut in the tender kinde, Of Okes and Elmes, these Louers names, engrauen you might finde. Whilst as they romed here and there, a thousand Songs they sung, To make them to forget their paine, fierce LOVE, them so had stung. The louely Shepheard, Sonnets made, in honor of his Dame, And in her presence sung them oft, presenting her the same. Which she accepted gratiously, whilst with hote sighes from hart, She shewde, how he grieu'd not alone, but that she bare a part. And thus (long time) both comfortlesse, did comfort one another, Long time, this secret Fire (hid close) in bosome they did smother. Whilst in some sort, the heauens did seeme, their actions to allow, And LOVE made show (as good, what so they did) for to avow. But weladay, what mortall thing, can euerlasting bee, When they themselues must (once) decay, and vnto ruine gree? When Fortune (enuious of our good) such interest hath and power, That he can alter our delights, and pleasures in an hower. No maruell (then) though that sweet life, of these two Louers ?maine?, He topsie turvie turned quite, for pleasure bringing paine. As you behold a stately Oke, in growth surpassing prowde, Vnder whose shade of late, the Plants, were glad themselues to shrowde. Whose cooly leaues and braunches greene, greatst Conquerors doth scorne Vpon their helmets and their Crests, most brauely to haue borne. Vpon (the suddaine through mischance) with Thunder strucke, as the Whilst (blasted with the Lightning flash) his head doth lye full low. His scorched leaues look black and swarth, his verdure all is gone, The Tree it selfe, shewing like a Truncke, a Blocke, or bared stone. No sappe or iuyce remaines therein, but dead it seemes to bee, Nor former glorie of his greene, you anie more can see. Euen so by malice most vniust, through Fortune full of strife, Of these two Louers (happie once) did end the pleasant life. The iealous heauens repining that, they thus should liue on earth, (Exempt from cares) Death sent to them, to stop their vitall breath. Death did they send as messenger, to sommon them from hence, And (for to bring the same about) they wrought a false pretence. This which we LOVE call, which two harts makes one, in loyall wise, The same (vow'de to the other oft) makes deadlyest Enemies. Of cold and freezing iealousie, the Author first he is, Whose sweetnes, sowrest miserie, to follow doth not misse. Nor euer hath there any thing, as yet, in him bene found, But (what with griefe and wretchednes) thicke swarming doth abound. His pleasures like are vnto spoyles, or like an Aprill showre, Which is no sooner come then gone, nor any while doth dure. That this is too too true, I vouch, Ænone, she it prou'd, And dolefull Dido, who did die, because one-much she lou'd. Achilles felt his furie fierce, when he Polixena Did sue to haue, whose witching face, was cause of his decay. Then of these faithfull Louers twaine, attend the Tale most sad, And marke, through vile iniurious LOVE, what pittious end they had. It channced (now) the Holly-day, due vnto LOVE, was come, In which, once euery yeare, great Feasts, most solemnely were done. His Temple in this Desart was, which holden was diuine, For honor it was wonderous rich, for beautie rare and fine. As well as Neighbours, Forrainers came thither far &amp; neare, The Demy-gods, Fawnes, Satyres, Nymphs, mongst Shepheards and appeare. These with their Crownes of Laurell greene, vpon their bushy head, Themselues did shew (in Courtly pomp) adorn'd and bellished. About their neckes hung hugie chaines, and pretious Carkenets, And bout their armes they Iewells ware, and costly Bracelets. Now that this God propitious, mongst them himselfe would show, Great store of Sacrifices they, vpon him did bestow. Perfumde with Incens offered, and hundred sorts of verse, Which did his power, his Maiestie, and noble deeds rehearse. That done, they did beginne to daunce; each one as lik'te them best, And to what daunce they Fancie had, to that themselues addrest. Whilst that the Syluans, and the Gods of woods, with Cornets shrill, With Hobbies, Bagpipes, and such like, the place throughout did fill. One doth a Brawle of Poitiers shew, another with a grace The measures leades, the third againe Lauolta treads apace. Thus euery one doth striue to please themselues with fresh delight, No falling out amongst them is, no malice, or despite. Not any was there bent to ill, nor any to displease, One sought another to content, to purchase ioy and ease. Together, mongst this merrie crew, there was our Louers twaine, When, as a curst mishap did chaunce, that cause was of their bane. For mongst the rest, that in that place did daunce, with blith-full glee, Euen in the midst of all their mirth, as merrie as might bee; A Nymph, there was, surpassing faire, for so she well did showe, So faire, as FLORA she did match, if not, before her goe. From forth her eies, like Diamonds, a sparkling fire did come, Whose glaunces shewed to be of force to equalise the Sunne. Her Amber looks (by nature curlde) lay wauing on her cheeke, As Seas doe gently beake on banke (a sight that all did leeke) This Virgin sweet, to NVMIDOR comes, with a grace most trim, And by the hand, the Shepheard takes, to daunce a while with him. Long did they daunce, and as they daunst, her colour fresher showes, And (still) the more she daunceth (aie) the more she fairer growes. So beautifull she seemes (indeed) as in that place there is, A Sauadge Satire, who begins, to thinke to doe amisse. In secret sort, to rauish her, he vowes by force and strife, Or else, before he lose his wish, hee'le lose his hatefull life. This Monster foule (mishapen wretch) vnworthie for to Loue, Dan Cupids fire, within his brest, beginneth (now) to proue. He frets, and fumeth inwardly, and through this vncoth heate, His colour (changing) comes and goes, his heart doth pant and beate. Respect of persons, place, and feare, lest he should not obtaine, His hairie bodie makes to shake, through a cold sweat amaine. Meane space, none doth him marke, or thinke that ere he durst presume, The companie thus to disturbe, in this his fretting fume. But LOVE that forceth mightiest Gods, and them hath (oft) controld, Makes him auditious, insolent, proud, haughtie, and so bold. That in the end (and suddenly) he carrieth her away, As doth the Wolfe, when violently, he seazeth on his pray. Ah helpe (she crieth pittiously) ah helpe, helpe (loud) she cries, Whilst, that through feare, &amp; sorrow she, dead in his rough (armes) lies. All are amaz'd, nor can they moue, onely braue NVMIDOR, Vowes for to rescew her from him, or else to die therefore. With naked sword in hand he runnes, after the Thiefe amaine, Yet all his running's to no end, he laboureth but in vaine. For so fast tripps the Satire, as it seemeth he doth flie, The Eagle faster takes not flight, when he from Ioue doth hie. Nor doth the Hawke (when he hath got the Partridge) seeme so swift, As this rude villaine doth, his feete so fast still moue and shift. But (still) the Nymph (for aide) doth crie, and after NVMIDOR Doth follow, hearing her hard by, which grieueth him the more. He followeth him apace, and (still) he keepes where he hath tras't, And (more he heares her to lament) the more he maketh hast. Yet though he doth all he can, he cannot him ore take, Which is the cause his breast he beates, and sorrow great doth make. And now hard at his heeles he is, which when the Satire sees, Into a hollow gloomie Rocke, to hide himselfe he flees. This was the cause the Shepheard lost, the wofull Damzels sight, Onely by crie of hers he knew, how follow her, he might. So long he seekes, that at the last he comes into the roome, Where as the Satire, gainst her will, the Virgin would orecome. Which sight, incenst him so with rage, as that his sword he takes, And trusting him through bodie quite, an end of him he makes. Downe fals the Monster in his gore, his lust begins to coole, Whilst with his streaming blood, he makes the place seeme like a Poole. Which when the gentle Shepheard sawe, no more he wearie was, (Now he had had his will) he for his trauaile did not passe. The frighted Nymph, he comforteth, and bids her be of cheare, Since that the Satire (for his rash attempt) had paid so deare. He wils her thanks the God of Loue, who had him thither sent, Her to protect from villanie, which was against her ment. Nor looketh he, for praise of her, but happier thinkes himselfe, To saue a Nymph from shame, then if he purchast had great wealth. Thus said the Shepheard to the Nymph, but (thus) although he said, Yet answered she him nought at all (for still she was afraid.) She shooke like an Aspen leafe, her hart did throb and pant, And being frighted in her minde, she breath, almost did want. Resembling right a prettie Hinde, by Hounds that being chast, And hardly scaping from their clawes, thinkes scarce the dangers past. She viewes the Satire, wallowing in his owne blood desperately, Yet though she plainely seeth the same, she scarce beleeues her eie. The Shepheard seeing her still doubt, from feare, her for to winne, Once more begins to comfort her, and thus he doth begin. Sweet Nymph, what meanst thou thus to doubt, and why thy selfe dost wrong. Dost not behold thy lustfull foe, dead for to lie along? To feare (where cause is) Reason wills; withouten cause to feare, Argues a minde depriu'd of sence, and signe's of folly meere. Comfort thy selfe, and (if thou can) tell me what new disgrace, May be of force, to daunt with dread; thy bloodlesse palie face. Seest not thy liuelesse enemie, his countenance dost not know? His earthly coarse as euidence that he is dead, doth show. Cease then to doubt, for feare of ought since now thou hast no cause, Leaue thus to weepe, waile, and lament and make thereof a pause. Take courage vnto thee, and thinke my victorie vpon, The wise (of dangers past) will nere so much as (once) thinke on. Then leaue off for to sorrow thus, and seeme not to disdaine, Through too much passion, honour this, which I through thee doe gaine. (So said) he gently helpes her vp, and sets her on her feete, Whilst with a thousand hunnie words, he sweetly her doth greete. The Nymph, now come vnto her selfe, begins to gather hart, To chase away all feare from her, which sore did breed her smart. Her former colour now doth come into her cheekes afresh, Whilst she in humble sort, with thankes vnto him doth expresse. Her gratefull minde, acknowledging in courteous manner trim, How that her honour, and her life, preserued were by him. With blushing looke, and smiling cheare, she crownes with flowers his head, And vowes in madest wise, to be at his deuotion led. But weladay who ere would thinke, that thanks for his reward, Should be the cause, a recompence he should receiue so hard. This kindnesse, which the Nymph on him bestowd, deseruing worth, Th'vntimely end of him and of his FLORA deare, brought forth. For doing good, the sillie Swaine, his harmelesse life must lose, A slender hire for praise, when at so high a rate it growes. Things taken well, are still done well; a sinne tis to instruct, Vpon surmises false and vaine, and proofes, not to haue iust. Ah had the Shepheards Mistris bene as wise as she was faire, She had not heapt vpon her selfe, nor him, such dismall care. Meane-time, braue Numidor, through his exploit, most famous grew, And through the Nymphs gratefull report, each one this matter knew. Which FLORA made for to misdoubt, for long time she before, Had markt the Virgin to be faire, the cause she feard the more. She sawe (as she did thinke) that or'e familiar he was With her, and how oft them betwixt, great kindnesses did passe. She well remembred, how they daunct together; and which most Did gaul her, how in hast away, he (after her) did post. When as the Satire snatch her vp, her to haue rauished, And (how to saue her) he againe his life had ventured. All these compar'd together, made her gesse, all was not well, So that, her bodie quite throughout, an vncoth cold sweat fell. And now she gan to loue so much, as iealous she did grow Of him, that (nere) the same deseru'd, nor had offended so. She sighes, and sobs, and franticklike, now here, now there doth runne, Thinking her dearest Loue of friend, an enemie was become. Nor dares she (in her soule) him call her faithfull seruant true, Nor worthie of a Mistris kind, since he hath got anew. Against (him say) she doth exclaime, and still gainst him doth crie, Cals him vniust, deceitfull, false, of right, an enemie. And (as if he committed had some monstrous sinne on earth,) She counts him worthie for to die, vnfit to draw his breath. And now, she throughly is assur'd, that he is giuen to range, And that of his first plighted Loue, he hath made an exchange. This forceth her, with face (one while) as pale and was to looke, Another while to be as red, as fire from furnace tooke. Now doth she burne, and then againe, she suddenly doth freese, Whilst through these passions contrarie, her sences she doth leese. And now to kill her NVMIDOR, she vowes most resolute, Since him, a periur'a wretch (and not better) she doth repute. That done, she meanes to end her daies, and slay her selfe, him by. The more, her constant Loue vnto the world to testifie. But now, Loue makes her change her thought, although against her will, And forceth her (although despite of her) to loue him still. She weepes and wailes, and pearly drops fall from her like small teares, Whilst as a bedlem she doth rent her face, and golden heares. She flings her self vpon the ground, her head thereon she knocks, Whilst griefe so much in her beares sway, as it tongues passage locks. With armes acrosse, vnto the heauens, she lifteth vp her hands, Whilst she, of Venus and her Sonne, reuenge of him demaunds. Yet, after of the matter she, better bethinkes her selfe, And then vnto him she doth wish, all happines and health. Grieuing that she so much hath spoke gainst him, she doth repent, And from her former cruell minde, most willing doth relent. But nerethelesse, she is resolu'd her selfe, to end her life, Thereby to ease her of her pangs, and rid her from this strife. So much, she doth disdaine to liue, as death she meanes to chuse, Since Numidor, a Mistris new, hath tooke, her to refuse. Ah cruell Shepheard doth she say, lamenting pittiously, Hast thou the hart, who thee so deare hath lou'd to force to die? Well, well, most vnkind man, I for thy sake, my selfe will slay, And goe into my graue I will (vntimely) fore my day. To please thee (not my selfe I sought) whilst I on th'earth did liue, Nor to prolong my dates ile seeke, since thee (I see) I grieue. But at this fault of thine so foule (vngratefull) dost thou thinke, The Gods aboue (true Iusticers) will seeme at all to winke. Thinkst thou (vnkind) the heauens will (ere) vnto thee be kinde, When (how thou fowly hast profan'd their Altars) they shall finde? No, no, th'immortall powers, sharpe foes vnto thy periurie, Shall doe me right, and wreake my wrong, for this my iniurie. Such punishment (with tortors huge) they shall on thee bestow, As they doe on Danaides, in Limbo lake below. And as they Theseus plagu'd because he wreched was forsworne, Or Iason, who Medea left, all comfortlesse, forlorne. With many other Louers false, which like are vnto thee, (There) as thou (rightly) dost deserue, afflicted thou shalt bee. For Iupiter, though (for a while) he men permits to rome, And fickle changings proue, yet in the end he paieth them home. So Paris died (and well deseru'd) Enone that abusde, Who in her life time (better) him (than he deseru'd) had vsde. Then dost thou thinke (fond-man) that thou shalt scape this scourge Who, art the sowrse of all my griefe, and motiue of my mone? Perhaps thou dreamest, because that they awhile their plagues doe spare, alone, They flowe are vnto punishment, nor of the same haue care. What is deferd, is not vnpaid; the time shall come ere long, That thou shalt make amends for misse, acknowledging this wrong. The more to chastise any fault, the Gods (gently) forbeare, The more at last they are rigorous, more cruell and seuere. Then, thinke not (wrech most treacherous) but that the day shall come, That thou shalt smart, for what thou hast to wofull Flora done. My cause to the heauens I doe commit, to them I doe appeale, They know the secrets of all hearts, nor ought will they conceale. And yet (sweet Numidor) forgiue, and pardon what I say, Since tis my griefe (not I) that thus, against thee doth enuay. For should'st thou neuer so much wrong doe vnto me each houre, Yet angrie for to be with thee, nere shall I haue the power. Loue, which is of more force in me, than is this thy offence, Command me (louing thee) with thee and with thy fault dispence. Iudge then of this strange crueltie, that it should me constraine, To loue and honour him who is the Author of my baine. So we, the feeble sicke man see, through senselesse fond desire, (What is th'occasion of his death) to couet and require. So I (arrested by proud Loue) am forst iniuriously, Alack the while, to honour thee, who laughst to see me die. Thee must I like, and follow still, despite of my poore hart, Although void of all honestie, and friendly Loue, thou art. Still for thy sake I languish must, in death, with great disease, Yet I my selfe count happie, since I doe it thee to please. The Gods forget (as I forgiue thee) from mine inward soule, And neuer may they, for my death, as faultie thee controule. As willingly I thee forgiue, as to my death I goe, For, being dead, thou then too late my constancie shalt knowe. Well maist thou haue a fairer friend, but faithfuller was neuer, Who as she seru'd thee, whilst she liu'd, in death shee'le loue thee euer. But thou, great Cupid, rightfull Iudge, reuenge my cause aboue, On her, who traiterously hath stolne from me, my heart and loue. Plague her that makes me pine away, example let her bee, To Louers all, how they take heede, to vse such treacherie. Plague her that hath my Louer stolen, my louely NVMIDOR, And let her feele like punishment, as I haue felt ore sore. Ah let her not, who loyall Faith, so shamefully doth soile, Raise Trophees of my ouerthrow, nor triumph in my spoile. Thus Flora praied and sigh't, thus wailde the heauie Shepheardesse, Was neuer Nymph, or Maiden borne, that felt such deepe distresse. In wailing, and in weeping, she did spend the day and night, And the remainder of her life, in sorrow sans delight. And now she wearie is of life, life doth her vex and grieue, A greater Corsie hath she not, than that she thus doth liue. She doth resolue to die forthwith, and yet she faine would chuse, The gentlest, and the easiest way, her soule from corpse to loose. For to dispatch her selfe with sword, it was too fierce and fell, The fire displeased her, and the rope to her was horrible. To fling her selfe downe from some Rocks high top she had desire, But being there, the height thereof, did make her to retire. Vpon the Seaish banke she stood, minding therein to lep, But raging waues did her afright from drowning they her kept. As we behold amaz'd to stand, the doubtfull traueller, Not knowing which way for to take, by reason of great feare. (Vnskilfull which path for to trace, beset most dangerously, Which he alreadie, seemeth in his minde, to view with eie. On euery side with Theeus, who all the passages about Haue laid, so as he knoweth not how, from thence to get him out. So Flora doubtfull, and yet full of corsiues and of paine; Knoweth not what death were best to chuse, though she would die full faine. She musing lookes, now here, now there, she runneth euery houre About the woods, and wisheth that some beast might her deuour. O, that we should ill wish our selues, oftentimes we wishing woe Vnto our selues, it lights on vs: poore Flora found it so. No wisedome tis, the Gods (to punish vs) to put in minde, Too soone, they can, if so they please, to plague vs, iust cause finde. Meane time, Loue, at this Shepheardesse doth smile and at her griefe, Who more she doth her woes bewaile, the more she wants reliefe. His glorie he embellisheth, by reason of her care, And his victorious Chariot, with the same doth make more faire. But leauing her (still) languishing, we will againe returne To Numidor, who missing her, doth waile as fast and mourne. He seekes and searcheth euery where, for Flora, he doth call, But yet no voice but Ecco shrill, doth answere him at all. Ecco, doth onely answere him, with wast, and fruitlesse sound, He heares her name, but Floras selfe, can no where yet be found. Like as the Hart (that louing Deare) when he his prettie Hinde, Runnes round about in euery place, with flying pace to finde. Now seeketh her amongst the Rocks, and then the woods among, Then in the Forrests there by Foords, and Riuers all along. And finding still to misse her, then seekes in some hollow Caue, To see if there her companie, as fortunate he may haue. And wearie now, with seeking her, he downe lieth in some place, Sighing full sore for want of her, whom he longs to embrace. So doth our Shepheard; who was now, with seeking her being tirde, Wailes his hard hap, not her to finde, whom he so much desirde. So much he wailes, as hardest Rocks, grieue that so much he seekes, And pittious Ecco, when he sighes, in recompence (now) weepes. Each thing, seemd (to their power) as though they succour to him brought, Onely did Flora want (alas) for whom so much he sought. Flora, for whom he sought, whom yet he could not once entreate, That she vouchsafe would to his cries, to answere and to speake. Flora, who power had ouer him, him to commaund alone, Whose death and life lay in her hands for her (thus) did he mone. And now into his troubled braine, did many fancies come, One while he thinkes some God of woods with her away is runne. Or that some other Satire ruffe, hath drawne her to some caue, And there (against her will) doth minde, his will on her to haue. Another while he doubteth sore, lest in this vncoth wood, Some sauadge beast hath seazde on her, and spilt her harmlesse blood Or else, he feares, she him will haue no more vnto her mate, But rather meanes, some Louer now, into her grace to take. Thus doth he languish comfortlesse, to see his hard estate, And in a manner doth begin to grow as desperate. What hopefull is, that he reiects, no ioy he entertaines, But as a man carelesse of helpe, he wretchedly remaines. As is a guiltie person brought before the Iudge seuere, Conuicted (fore him) for his fault, which proued is most cleare. His conscience telling him of his offence, and his amisse, And for to proue the same, before him, his sharpe witnesse is. Which when he findeth, shame and griefe doth so his sinnes confound. As he his life, not to respect, nor to regard is found. So wofull full of heauie care, this haplesse Shepheard was, And (so, he Flora had not lost) for life he did not passe. But hauing lost her, he did thinke, his heart and soule was gone, And therefore comforted he would not be of any one. Yet he no sooner breath had tooke, but that he nerethelesse, For all his toyling, gan to seeke, and search for her afresh. He prieth into euery bush, through groues he looketh all, And runnes so fast, as oftentimes (through hast) he downe doth fall. Trough brambles sharpe, through bushes, and through hedges he doth passe, Through thicke and thinne, and all to finde his long sought dearest I lasse. Like to the Deare that chased is, by Hunter, he did runne, And then againe begins the course, that he before had donne. When, missing of his purpose, he laments in pitteous case, And (cruell to himselfe) doth scrath and teare his manly face. Euen as Hippollitus the chaste, was drawne by his faire haire, Through forrests, woods, and mountaine tops, and hurried euery where. And at the last, his limmes were rent asunder one from one, Whilst (frighted with sea monsters) he from Chariot fell alone. So, such our Shepheard seemd to be, resembling such a wight, Whilst streames of blood runne downe alongst his bodie, view you might. He sighes and sobs, within the woods, with voice most dolorous, Whilst on the name of Ladie his, he crieth and cals on, thus. Ah where art thou my Flora deare? alas, where maist thou be? And why shouldst thou be so vnkind, to hide thy face from me? What place so happie is to hold thy selfe (mine onely ioy?) Thy beautie (now) where doth it shine, chasing away annoy? (Light of mine eies) say dost thou loue? ah yet vnto me speake? And be not so vnkind, my heart (with calling thee to breake?) Where so thou liu'st, blessed is that place, thrise blessed aie, More willing than in paradise, I there would bide and staie. Alacke what haue I done to thee, thou shouldst be so vnkind, To part from me (my better part) and leaue my soule behind? No doubt, some God hath gotten thee, enioying presence thine, Some heauenly power doth honour thee, which breedeth sorrow mine. For thinkest thou, withouten thee, I can draw forth this breath? Thinkst thou that in thine absence I can liue vpon this earth? Then speake (my sweet) vouchsafe so much, as tell me, where art thou? Where bide those rare perfections, and where shine thy vertues now? May I not be so happie, as to know, where thou dost keepe? Since for thy losse, I cannot chuse, eternally but weepe? Without thy carefull Numidor, tell me where doest thou staie? Who (euer) hath thee lou'd, and who will loue thee still for aie? Canst thou, if him (as he doth thee) so much and truely loue, Grieue him so much, vex him so much, and ouermuch him moue? I knew the time, I must confesse, when as thou didst sermount, For loyall Loue, and when of me, thou diddest make account. I know, I know, thou loud'st me once, that loued me thou hast, And that for constant loyaltie, our mutuall Loue hath past. I know that Loue, ore both our hearts, tryumpht as Conquerour, And that or'e both our soules he had, the like and selfesame power. Ile sweare that once thou louedst me, though now thou lou'st me not, Though now that fire extinguisht is and thou hast me forgot. I know not, if (as wearie of me) thou beginst to range, And that thy fickle minde desires, elsewhere to soare and change. Or, whether, hauing found a man, thou better likst than mee, I am reiected, and shooke off, and quite cassheirde by thee. Which if that it be so, why then, die must poore Numidore, And with his death, his fortune hard, and thy bad minde deplore. If it be so, he must resigne his life to death, and die Rather than liue, thus languishing in paine continually. If it be so, I needs must say (though so to say) doth griue, There is no trust in any one, no faith on earth doth liue. Needs must I say women are false, that constant fewe remaine, And that their Sex doth harbor nought, but false dissembling shame. If it be so, that Flora, false, to Shepheard hers hath prou'd, Then well I sweare, that loyally, neuer hath (woman) lou'd. But why (alas) talke I so vaine? too idle is my head, Whilst with such franticke raging fits my fantasie is fed? What madding humor vexeth me, what bedlem iealousie? What fond conceit makes me to talke (Sans Sens) so foolishly? Am I so vilely giuen, to thinke that Flora will cassbeire Her seruant Numidor, whom she (before) hath lou'd so deare? That she (to any) but to him, will true and faithfull proue, That she will falsifie her faith, orethrowing her first Loue? O thought most base to haue of her, conceit her to mistrust, O traiterous Shepheard, worthlesse man, O louer most accurst. Haue I (long) heretofore, her Loue with Touchstone throughly tride, And shall she now with sensure hard, withouten cause abide? Shall I, of infidelitie condemne her, and suspect, When I haue euer knowne her, all bad motions to reiect? No, no sweet Flora, I dare sweare, and I doe know too well, Thou lou'st thy Numidor, nor him (for new) wilt euer sell. No, thou dost loue him, though some God, hath tane thee gainst thy will, And keepeth thee (perforce) although, thou neuer meanedst ill. I know thou dearely louest him, as dearely as thy hart, And that his absence makes thee waile, and in thee breedeth smart. I know my presence thou dost wish, and dost lament my losse, I know, that my not being with thee, thou dost count a crosse. I doe beleeue assuredly (nor otherwise ile thinke,) Thy loue so sacred nere can die, nor euer be extinct. Too much thou louedst me, too much thou (aie) of me didst make, To leaue me, to abandon me, and me for to forsake. Thou louest me, and dost desire with me to be, I know, But that bad fortune crossed thee, the faults thereof to show. Then in what place, thy sweetest selfe doth soiourne and doth stay, And where so ere thy beautie faire her brightnes doth display. Where ore thy gratious eie doth glaunce, controlling with delight, Embellishing with lustrious raies, the glorie of thy sight; Ah, there the Gods I doe beseech, all happines to raigne, Downe on thee fast, whilst there thou maist, in pleasure (safe) remains. Whilst I meane while, will goe to seeke some wofull vncoth place, Some hollow Rocke, where I may liue, since I can finde no grace. For being of thy seemely shape (though vndeseru'd) depriude, I needes must breath my last of force, and seeke to be disliude. Then happie liue thou, liue thou long, and neuer maist thou tast, Of sorrow such as I haue done, to force thy life to wast. Thus said the Shepheard, and therewith, seekes still some hollow Caue, Wherein he soone may finde his end, which he desires to haue. He seekes to finde his death, whilst her to finde he nere doth sinne, As did Apollo, Daphna chase, whose loue he sought to winne. Nor wearied is he: Louers nere are wearied, when the fire Of Loue doth burne their entrailes hot, with coales of strange desire. Long trauaile, neuer tireth them, but still they labour fresh, And though they be ore chargde, yet take thy courage nerethelesse. Then Numidor (by Loue) borne out, both day and night doth seeke For his faire Saint, for whom he longs and much desires to meete. As one beholds the Lionesse, at mouth with froth to fome, When she to seeke her little ones (stolne from her) forth doth runne. She neuer staieth, but restlesse runnes the forrests all about, Nor giues she ore, although her bones and backe doe cracke throughout. Running, sometimes vpon the hills, and then on Champions plaine, Another whilst alongst corne fields, with swiftie pace amaine. And in the end wearied with griefe, her selfe flings on the ground, Resolu'd to die (through hunger) staru'd, since they will not be found. So such a part our Shepheard plaide, when he did see with eie, His Mistris he no where could finde, he faints, resolu'd to die. But weladay, before his death, he sawe his Flora faire, Flora for whom so oft he calde, the cause of all his care. The coarse of that faire Nymph, for whom he thought himselfe forlorne, He found a Sauadge beast had all in pieces cruell torne. For whilst through madding iealousie, she vp and downe did fret, In thickest woods, as she desirde, a Lion there her met. Which seazing on her with his pawes, did teare her in a trise, (The goodliest creature that did liue) he slewe in furious wise. Yet as she died, on Nunidor she calde (as he might heare) For helpe, though all in vaine, and though (as then) he was too neere. Too neere to her so pittious sound, too farre to helpe her tho, Which was the reason, that the more it did encrease his woe. (She slaine) away the Lion runnes, when as from mountaine hie, He might perceiue her breathlesse trunke, in peeces torne to lie. Which when he sawe, he thither ranne, as if he had bene mad, So fast he ranne, as (running) then, nor strength nor breath he had. Downe falls he sounding for pure griefe, vpon the liuelesse corse, So long, as he did seeme: indeed as dead, without remorse. At last (though long) he once more comes vnto himselfe againe, Calling his vitall spirits to him, although with grieuous paine. Whilst for to vtter these fewe words (words grieuous) he doth proue, Words such, so pittifull, as well both heauen and earth might moue. And art thou dead (faire natures worke) the Mirrour of thy time, Art thou disliu'de, whom all admirde as sacred and diuine? Art thou a prey to enuious Death, could Death thee thus annoy? Who whilst thou liu'dst, my comfort wast, my solace and my ioy? O Death vniust, damnd, enuious vnto my chiefest ease, Durst thou so much (ore insolent) my Flora faire displease? Woes mee th'art dead, and with thee dead, are those thine Eyes so bright: Thine Eyes, which men for to reuiue, had power, enough, and might. Ah thou art dead, where whilom lodg'd mine hart, and inward soule, Thou now art dead, whose onely lookes, the proudest did controule. But thou art dead, and can I liue, to see a sight so sore? Is Flora gone, and likely ist, that liue should Numidore? Prodigious Planets, me to make ore-liue my Ladie deare, Since shee, the Essence of my life was, whilst I liued here. Heauens most vniust, to giue to mee, of life so long a scope, Since I behold (destroyed) her, in whom was all my hope. But yee mine eyes, why feare you not, so foule a sight to marke? And looking on it, afterwards, become not blinde and darke? Most cruelly destned as I was; thrice happie had I beene, If I had neuer had these eyes, and neuer could haue seeme. Thrice happie I, if some wilde beast, in picces had me tore, So I this murther nere had spide, which I so much abhore. I was not (beautious Nymph) no way, to be compar'd to thee, If so, why then should any way, Death hinder be to mee? Accursed soule of mine, and thou, mine euer restlesse hart, Canst thou abide to breath so long, to taste such vncoth smart? I am a Man, and of more strength, then she was; why then first Since I could (better) death endure, died I, not most accurst? Reason it was, and conscience, that I die before thee should, Since as my Faith, and dutie was, not saue thy life, I would. Cruell Lyon, that hast deuourd my ioy, come doe thy will On mee, who for to liue on earth, count it a haynous ill. Come, come, and from this miserie, let him I pray be rid, Who doth desire to end his dayes, as his poore Flora did. Doe vs this pleasure, for to kill vs both (at once) together, That dying so, thou both maist please (as well contenting either) Why com'st not (cruell) then; since that for thee I doe attend? And stay thy leisure, that thou mightst, my wretched bodie rend. I see thou art no Lyon right, but of a Bastard kinde, Else sooner mee, then Ladie mine (ere this time) thou wouldst finde. A Lyon, generous indeed, disdaineth for to prey, On silly Virgins, harmles Maides, but lets them goe their way. Hee onely seazeth on stout men, or such as be his Foes, And spoyleth them, that chaseth him tearing in pieces those. Where, for to tyrannize vpon a Nymph, a murthers such, As neuer like was heard before and is detested much. But I perceiue thou dar'st not come, yet in despite of thee, Ile spoyle my selfe, that so I may, with my deare Mistris bee. Ile die, that I may follow, for to serue my Misteris, Who seekes his Lady to suruiue, of life not worthie is. (Faire) thee the heauens haue reft, to make themselues more faire to show, Whilst here, vpon the earth with vs, they nought haue left, but woe. Faire, they haue taken thee away, to beautifie more faire Themselues, whilst here (instead of thee) they leaue eternall care. Meane time, I liue still languishing, thy heauy losse to rue, Vnworthy to haue bidden thee farewell, or once Adieu. Yet Flora, in despite of Death, thou flourish shalt for euer, Thy praise shall shew Acanthus like, still flowring, dying neuer. The sweet Cloue, Gilliflower, and Rose, of Spring, it shall put downe, Thy beautie was more beautifull, and of more fresh renowne. My daintie Flora being dead, shall be such kinde of Flower, As she shall be eternall (aye) and flourish euery hower. Death may our liues abridge (through Spite) hating our youthfull dayes, But Vertue it can nere subdue, nor subiugate her praise. But why liue I? it may be sayd, that I in life remaine, Who liuing, feele the torments of damn'd Ghosts, eternall paine. No, no, I liue no more, my dayes are turn'd to darkest nights, Already I am registred, amongst the liuelesse Sprights. That I should liue, and Flora dead, a thing's impossible, To stay behinde her, she being gone, I loued her too well. (Sweet) I must satisfaction make, to thee for mine offence, Although I shame when I doe thinke, on my vile negligence. Had I bene carefull ouer thee as (but my pert) it was, Thou then hadst bene aliue as now, to ioy with me (alas.) I did deserue the punishment, for thou didst nere offend, Ah woe is mee, thou not through Foes, hast died, but through thy Friend. For which my trespasse, I resigne my life most willingly, Neuer so much desiring life, as now I wish to die. But yet before I breathe my last, let me obtaine thy grace, That I may kisse those Diamon eyes, that quondant beautious face. Which said, the Shepheard taketh vp, her limmes so scattered, Whilst them embracing, floods of teares, vpon them (swift he shed) So much, and oft, so pittifull, he sobb'd, and sigh'd so fast, As ruthlesse Rocks, seemd for to moane, and halfe in pieces brast. So wofully he wailde, as All (except his Mistris deare, Who to a better world was gone) did seeme his plaintes to heare. Yet though hee sighed, wept, and grieu'd, and did lament so sore, He could not nere-thelesse his Loue, to former life restore. For Floras Spirits were flowen from hence, her soule it did ascend To heauens, where her betrothed Spouse, with ioy, she did attend. Which he perceiuing, gets him vp, and to a Mountaine goes, From top of which, on Mistris his, himselfe (he headlong) throwes. He falls vpon her breathlesse limmes, and as he dying fell, He calls on her, and still he cries; Flora, Adieu, Farewell. Their murthered bodies massacred, within a while were found, Which were intomb'd together both, within one graue in ground. And that of this their loyall Loue, the Fame should neuer die, This wofull Story was engrauen, in plates of Iuorie. [Lucklesse, and luckie, (both at once) am I] Lucklesse, and luckie, (both at once) am I, With feare and hope, I trembled as a Reed: Lucklesse, by Beautie thine, by Destinie, Luckie, because I am thy slaue indeed. For (then thy face) there nothing is more faire: Then thy sweet Eyes, nought more diuine or rare. One while I hope, another while I feare, Nor can there any thing my fancie please: It greeues me for to see the heauens, though cleare, So much I doubt thy fauour to displease. Then thy faire face, there nothing is more faire: Then thy sweet Eyes, nought more diuine or rare. Then (sweet sower Foe) vouchsafe me for to loue, Or once for all, abridge my time of life: Nor suffer me, such torments more to proue, Since I must die, lest thou appease this strife. For then thy face, there nothing is more faire. Than thy sweet Eyes, nought more diuine or rare. Although thine Eyes, my paines encreaseth more, Yet (more I see them) more I them admire: Thy beautious feature, I so much adore, As for to die for it, I still desire. For then thy Face there nothing is more faire: Then thy sweet Eyes, nought more diuine or rare. For louing thee, my greefes I happie deeme, Though cruell and vnsuffrable they bee: Whilst at the same (as enuious) I doe seeme, Though for thy sake, how I still die I see. Then thy faire face, there nothing is more faire: Than thy sweet eies, nought more diuine and rare. Then whether death, my life shall take away, Or whether I shall laid be in my graue, Yet will I loue, and honour thee for aie, Both dead, and liue, my seruice thou shalt haue. For then thy face, there nothing is more faire: Than thy sweet eies, nought more diuine or rare. [Hard Rocks, Rocks cruell, insolent by nature and obdure] Hard Rocks, Rocks cruell, insolent by nature and obdure, Will you no pittie take on me, for torments I endure? Is no compassion in you lodg'd, can nothing be of force? Yet (at the last) though long to rew, and yeeld me some remorce? Ah, if my plagues cannot blaine, that they may cured be, At lest, yet daine, at my sad cries, with voice to answere me. Ah speake, and say the truth, shall I be freed once of this paine? Or must I still endure therein, and languishing remaine? ECCO. Languishing remaine. Ah say (alas) must this my paine (as thou assurd'st me hast,) (Immortall be, continuing still, and must it alwaies last? ECCO. Alwaies last. What comfort then may succour me, who scarcely draw my breath, What may my dying soule reuiue, which is so nigh to death? ECCO. Death. Shall I then liue in sorrow thus? my life away that weares, And sighing, shall I nothing doe, but powre forth watrie tearess ECCO. Watrie teares. But sighing thus, ist possible my more than mortall ill, (Which makes me peecemeale pine away) should thus continue still ECCO. Still. Continuing in my passions thus, opprest with torments rife, What other things will they take hence, will they take hence my life? ECCO. Life. To end my woes, in this sad plight, an end, how might I haue? Shall I finde my reliefe by Loue? or when I am in graue? ECCO. In Graue. But after millions of these woes, being burnt with Loues hot Fewell, For to requite my paines, how shall I finde my Mistris cruell? ECCO. Cruell. Why, then I see, no pittie she, willford me for my griefe, And since tis so, ile yeeld my selfe to death, without reliefe. With one selfe bloodie instrument, and with one selfesame blade, My wounded corpse shall healed be, my soule be well apaide. Since onely death, and none but death, to me can comfort giue, What should me hinder (haplesse) that I should longer liue? I, I will die, yea I will die, and will a minde imbrace, To massacre that wretched state, that followeth me in chase. The first Sonnet. [Thy beautie tis, which (cause, immortall it doth showe,)] Thy beautie tis, which (cause, immortall it doth showe,) So many proud harts it doth curb, and bring downe lowe. It is thy dauntlesse spirit, that all as wonderous deeme, Which thy faire face, and Thewes, more fairer maketh seeme. Ah doe not suffer then are cruell to appeare, Whilst they, their honours due (due vnto them) doe heare. Sacred, he is held with Gods, and sweet to Louers such, Who faithfully doth, thee adore, and reuerence so much. (Faire honour) neuer doe, this mischiefe foule permit, But let milde pittie in the looke, of this mine enemie fit. In my sweet enemies eies, where writ is beauties storie, And let not Surquedrie eclips, with hate such seld seens glorie. At lest yet come to me: so, if the worst doe come, I shall haue honour, though by death I be vndone. Whilst she the heauens shall see, her (sharpely) to rebuke, And mestfull mourne, that she such wrong course gainst me tooke. The second Sonnet. [I liue no more, or if (as yet I liue] I liue no more, or if (as yet I liue, Tis thee to please (thou enemie to my life:) No greater ill, then nourish what doth grieue, Maintaining quenchlesse fire to burne vs rife. What hates me, I most greedily desire, What helpe me may, that helpe to me denies: Alas of whom then shall I aide require, A happie Louer's he (bewaild) that dies. Cruell mishap to force vs for to loue, What vs doth follow with a deadly bate; And that, as sacred to account and proue, Which spoyles, and shortneth our chiefe quiet state. Thrise trebble blest, that neuer knoweth this ill, For better tis disloyall to be thought: Then (for a dismall Ladie) suffer still, Who better lost is, then for to be sought. AN ODE. Since that thou hast Victorie Ore my dearest Libertie. Why (with blacke Robe) beautie thine, Doest thou cloathe, so rich and fine? If thou wear'st it for to witnesse, (As a friend) my sadde distresse. Happie I, since for my sake, Thou the Colours sadde doest take. (Sweete my life) content be thou, That this blacke Weede, I beare now, Haplesse was my life, and so, Sad my life, in th'end shall show. (To mee) these sadde cloathes alone, Appertaine, as signes of mone. Nature in one bodie (nere) Blacke and White, (at once) doth beare. From my Blacke, all hate be wide, With which I my Crosses hide. Hee that in dispaire doeth rest, Black doeth beare (for colour) best. (Cruell) this, not Colour's thine. Since thine eyes, bright and diuine. (Sacred as the hallowed day) Chase the gloomie Night away. One, that (or'e All's) Victor braue, Cannot rightly, this Blacke haue. Our harts wounded, thou doest make, Then (of Conquerour) habite take. And let mee alone with this, Since my fitting colour t'is. Liue thou in eternall glorie, Whilst I die, (at desperate) sorie. Whilst this Dye, thou putst on thee, Thou depriu'st (of comfort) mee. For I doubt that thou art sad, And thy griefe, Death's (to me) bad. Change then, this same weede of Dule, Fit for dead folks, (O thou Cruell.) Why, through it wouldst thou impaire, Beautie thine, farre more then rare? Leaue it, for I thee assure, This, my sight cannot endure. Giue to mee my ?Colour? blacke, Or with Ghostes, I goe to wracke. If, my Colour thou doest take, For to ende my Crosses make Thou wilt not; for whilst I liue, More thou daylie wilt mee grieue. [The heauens (for honours theirs) thee faire haue made] The heauens (for honours theirs) thee faire haue made, The heauens (for my mishap) mee kinde haue framde: Ioue, (for his praise) infanted Vertue thine, Gods, heauen, and earth, reape honour, through thy glorie. I onely am accurst, but victorie T'is, to wage Combat with a Deitie. I loue that sweet band, which enchaines my soule, Liuing, I burne, yet honour I thee flame: Loe, how rich Beautie can vsurpe ore mee, Medusa like, my Nature thou dost chaunge. But hee his Time spends not, but gaineth honor, Who brauely fights, vnder a Goddesse Banner. O happie I, when I thy face behold, More rare and perfect, than was Venus faire: When I thine Eyes, see shining, like two Starres, Gazing I die, whilst death brings life to mee. He happie dieth, that his best life doth end, In loyall seruice of his beautious friend. More happie I, myselfe iudge so to die, Than Adon liu'd, whilst hee the daintie Corpse Of Venus ioyde, who wailde his death most sadde, Hee blessed was, but I, celestiall. Since Fortune mine, with his may well compare, And beare away the prize, for ouer-Faire. Beautious, if onely for to see thy stainelesse Feature, More happie t'is, than Gods, by many wayes: What should I be, wouldst thou (to loue mee) ?deine?, But so great good, vnworthie I, to haue. The Gods would iealous grow, that one poore wretch, In gratious fauor (boue themselues) should stretch. Yet (in despite of them) my ioyfull life, Liueth in contemplation of thy Thewes: Whilst, they like rolling Spheares, the Skies adorne, Happie that Lambe, offered in Sacrifice, To burne vpon thy Aultars, Grace to gaine, Whose Tombe, and Ashes, winnes vnto him, Fame. [Like to Achilles, seem'd hee strong and braue] Like to Achilles, seem'd hee strong and braue, When hee, into their Towne, the Troyans draue. [As Hector did, who beat the Grecians back] As Hector did, who beat the Grecians back, That had (before) the Troyans put to wrack. [Achilles (nere so much) lox'd Briseis so faire] Achilles (nere so much) lox'd Briseis so faire, For whome, (to quarrell so) hee then, did dare. [Yet, his misfortunes take to them, a larger scope] Yet, his misfortunes take to them, a larger scope, Hee giues not ore to Loue, though he is without hope. [Each Louer, that is burned with this amorous flame] Each Louer, that is burned with this amorous flame, In word and deed, dependeth on his louely Dame. [That thy rash speech make thee for to repent] That thy rash speech make thee for to repent, Which at vnwares most fondly from thee went. [And that the sooner he might die with care] And that the sooner he might die with care, Ioy banishing, he entertaines dispaire. [Sweet hope, the life of euery one (what ere) doth cherish] Sweet hope, the life of euery one (what ere) doth cherish, And were it not for wisht for hope, all men would perish. [My sighes, when giue you ore to sigh then forth my paine?] My sighes, when giue you ore to sigh then forth my paine? Mine eyes, when haue you done to waile my griefe, though all in vaine? Was ere seene such strange crueltie, where Loyaltie is found? Whilst (through th'vngratefull) for to die, remorselesse I am bounds I die, but in what sort, alas my woes so many be, As neuer any heretofore, hath suffered like to me. Happie is he that to his end by one sure stroke doth hie, To languish (dying) is far worse, then quickly for to die. My teares that in mine eyes doe stand (with sihges) my griefes doe showe, And yet ther's none that pittieth me, whilst worse I still doe growe. I cannot cured be, and she that's Author of my griefe, (To slay my selfe) she weapons giues vnto me (Sans reliefe.) Like Captiue am I led away, yet can I not behold Her face, to whom I prisoner am, and who my hart controld. He is no valiant Souldiour right, nor any Conquerour braue, Who to his prisoner dares not showe himselfe, when he doth craue. But heauens I see conspire gainst me, this life I finish must, Yet happie he, that in his loue diest loyally and iust. Sacred for euer, Faile shall it neuer, Since that Loue so true, Though none the same rewe This my Monument, Within it is spent. But (cruell) thou too late shalt finde, vntimely death of mine, My Loue was pure, my hart most iust, and bare thereof the signe. Yet ile not taxe thee for my death, thy rigor hard to proue, Ile say it was my destinie, and not thy nere gaind loue. But why (in vaine) seeke I in life, to haue a farther scope, He happie dieth, who in the world hath liued without hope. Then lets dispatch by sweetest end to rid vs of this paine, Lets shun this troublesome sea, the port with Ancor ours to gaine. His death is blessed, Of life disposessed, Ending of his life, He shuns care and strife, When by a sweet way, And in rest doth stay. [Nothing is hard vnto a Louers minde] Nothing is hard vnto a Louers minde, When hee doth seeke to please his Mistrisse kinde. [That Louer true, which to his Mistrisse makes an Oath] That Louer true, which to his Mistrisse makes an Oath, Will die before (to her) hee'le breake his vowed Troath. [My fortun's strange, the whole world holds me deare] My fortun's strange, the whole world holds me deare, And though I nothing am of nothing made, Yet I so spotlesse shew, so faire and cleare, As noblest states, of me are well apaid. What ere passeth by me, I see the same, Yet I no eyes haue, and am formed so: As smallest force doth bring to me my bane, Breaking me peece-meale, with a little blow. My propertie most true is, what doth breath, I liuely that present, in face and beautie: And (which is more) I creature (nere) deceiue, Great personages to me bowe, as t'were of dutie. Yet I them faithfull serue, whilst loth they are To leaue me, so well they my companie Doe like Say then, who rightly can me barre, From honour such, as all giue vnto mee? [Since that Loue is worse then death] Since that Loue is worse then death, And suruies, when coarse wants breath: I will chase away the same, Least I vext be with that paine. For she is fond that liues by Loue, And many plagues is like to proue. What would euery one report, If I liue should in such sort? Hope in vaine and to no end, Marre my selfe, rather then mend. Since she is fond that liues by loue, And many plagues is like to proue. Yet I here protest, though I, Meane to leaue Loues crueltie. Yet I Cupid honour still, Whilst he worketh me none ill. For she is fond that liues by loue, And many plagues &amp;c. I confesse, ther's passions sweete In Loue, for true Louers meete. Such as doth them gently warme, And their harts most sweetly charme. Though she is fond that liues, And many plagues &amp;c. But when tis ore violent, Then the soule with griefe is rent. Whilst it reaues vs of our sence, Therefore ile wish such dispence. For she is fond that liues by loue, And many plagues is like to proue. The end of the forth daies meeting of Iuliettaes Shepheards. THE FIFTH AND LAST DAYES MEETING OF IVLIET. TAES SHEPHEARDS. [What but pale Death can serue as remedie] What but pale Death can serue as remedie, To ease my more then cruell paine? The Pilot that safe in the Hauen doth lie, To feare the Seas tempestuous rage doth shame. She happie is, that in this wretched earth, Can ridde be from all woes, through gentle death. But shee that cannot die, (liuing displeasde) Forc't without aide, for to endure her smart: Can no way haue her endlesse torments easde, But by her cries and fighes, sent forth from heart. But who can make a Sauadge minde ore-wilde, For to become calme, pittifull, and milde? The Mother faire, of Cupid's, blinded Boy, Could not her Corpse from soule see separate: Yet for Adonis, shee was full of noy, Seeing him slaine, by too vntimely Fate. Immortall powers, though freed from Death they bee, Yet (being grieu'd) they mourne as well as wee. Apollo that same faithfull Louer true, When he sawe Daphne metamorphosed: Died not, yet he her chaunce long time did rewe, For Loue makes Gods to waile, and teares to shed. Death endeth euery amorous mortall warre, Yet in such wise to die, they happie are. I am a Nymph, therefore (as Phœbus was) From death exempt, so am I, yet am bound: My time and yeares in sighes and groanes to passe, Whilst ouermuch I gainst my selfe am found. To honour him, who is my deadliest foe, But where Loue is, there euer bideth woe. Yet doth that cruell wretch (who me doth scorne) Not altogether liue withouten griefe: Though for my loue to waile he was not borne, Whilst my hope's vaine, and his without reliefe. A Loyall Louer right is neuer seene, Well of two Ladies, at one time to deeme. Thus doe the heauens, reuengement (for me) take, And yet alas, this doth increase my cares: For (me) his torments worser farre doe make, And I am ill, because not well he feares. She that loues faithfull, maketh farre more mone For her friends hard mishap, then for her owne. A beautie more then earthly sacred right, The Subiect's of my euerlasting dule: Whilst I confesse, I, like a mortall wight, And yet the heauens, who all our actions rule, Nothing more perfect then the same ere sawe, The bad, as well as good, to fancie doth vs drawe. [A fierce LOVE, that burned hast my hart with milde flame] A fierce LOVE, that burned hast my hart with milde flame, In my Mistris sweet thoughts, thoughts for me too high, to reach too: And with deepe desire, doest make mee for to adore her. Ah proud LOVE, that lik'st our wailings, laugh'st for to see still, Our Breasts wounded all with goare, through heauenly Beautie, Through glaunce of such sparkling Eyes, as into our soules diue. After so much done vnto mee, now hast thou the courage After so many hurts th'ast done mee, now for to helpe mee? And to abridge my paines? Speake (sweete Desire) I doe pray thee. Ah, but alas, what a Follie were it for mee to thinke so? Thy crueltie, thou nere giuest ouer; Thou to the world comst Our Faults seuerely to punish, as the Gods Hang-man. Mars, by (their sufferance) knew thy too wanton a Mother. When thou into the world wast brought forth, like to a Bastard. Of Female bloodshed th'art Sonne, and of bloody murther: Foule fall thee therefore, that hast most shamefully cousned Thousands of Heroick spirits, whome wee doe Gods call: Canst thou then falsly breaking the lawes of thy Byrth-right, Curteous (now) become, and be not like to thy Father? Canst thou prooue better then thy Mother, who was an Harlot? No, no: for ripe Grapes from Thistles, neuer can we gather: Nor can I hope (once) well, that thou beeing proud, euer after Hast minde Gentle, to turne for my good, good for to doe mee. No (LOVE) I confesse, I not deserue, whome I doe honour, Worthie shee is for the Gods, and too too fure is shee, for me. Too too vnworthie I am, t'enioy her, whom I doe loue so, Onely to thinke that I loue so faire a soule, doth appease paine. All my paine, and my torments, though they be as immortall, When I remember, that in her liues, what is adorned; How that the wisedome is in her of Pallas, abounding, How that portly Gate of Iuno, is in her walking. And how for Beautie (as Venus, shee's a Goddesse. Then goe thy wayes (Cupid,) packe hence, for well am I pleased, Thy helpe, nor thine ayde to assist mee, ought doe I care for. Happier I can neuer be, then when I behold her. Whom I doe highly prise, reuerence, and obey, aboue all things. And farre more then pleasures false, (Lusts chiefest Allurings) Which fond Louers buy full deare, ioyes, which soone doe away flitte, And likewise kill vs, long, long before our time's come. I doe not honour her, (for to dishonour her) for her Vertues are that I like, so they her minde haue adorned. For where Vertue is, there's a minde, Vnconquered euer. Nor will I craue any other guerdon, whilst I doe liue here. What's diuine will I loue, and what's worthily steemed, For such praise hath shee wonne, as she shall liue euerlasting. [(Sweet) doe not thinke thy pearly teares, my paines can asswage ought] Examitor and Pentamitor verses. (Sweet) doe not thinke thy pearly teares, my paines can asswage ought, Not death, but thy teares, bring to my soule his adue: For thy grieuous plaints in steed of one onely short death, Thousand deaths and more are to me, paine to encrease. I not deserue that thou for me shouldst wofully weepe thus, Tis not death, but thy teares, take from my selfe my delight: Death alone this sillie corpse commands, when it askes him, But thy griefes doe force, soule for to flie to the skie. After so many paines in our loue, leaue vnto me giue none Hence to depart in peace, rest that I may in my graue: Long enough haue I liu'd, since that so gentle a liking, Tide hath thy hart to mine, and to thy soule ioyned mine. Then this my exceeding torments (Faire) doe not enuie, Since that I desire life (then thy selfe) for to leaue: Farewell, pleasd he dyes, who dying, findeth a fauour, When that his Ladies hand, close vp his eyes at his end. What more sacred Tombe, to be enterd can I chuse me, Then to die in thy armes, where my desire euer liu'd? If whilst I liu'd, thou care didst take for my poore life, At my happines then, ah be not enuious now. Leaue I beseech thee, teares to shed, since teares cannot helpe me, For my soule once gone, thou by thy teares cannot haue Cruell death to relent with sighes, you neuer intreate can, Blest that Louer dies, who by his Loue makes an end. Onely this I beg at thy hands, before that I die here, Those faire beautious eyes, kisse that I might but a while: Might I but finde this kindnes rare, then blest would my soule be. Nor would it ere forget, thanks to requite in his minde: (Faire) too much it were for me to die in thy sweet armes, He that dies content, death neuer feeles, or his dart: Who to his Mistris, doth deuote his hart as a present, Leaues the same in his brest, royally laide in a Tombe. Gloomie night for to close mine eyes fast, can neuer haue power, Nor can I die as long as (what I like) I may see. Then doe but thinke on me, whose soule was onely deuoted Vnto thy selfe, and which liu'd in thy brest that is chaste. In the bottome of my darke graue, shine shall thy bright eyes, Whilst with a new fire, death shall me reuiue once againe. For if (heretofore) the same could into my soule peirce, Who can hinder it now brightly to shine on my coarse? Then deare Saint) to leaue these wailings let me request thee, I doe not sigh, cause I die, but thee to see to lament. For since (of thy grace) I am not worthy, but vnfit, Then as much as a teare, why for my sake shouldst thou shed? Vnder the yoake of amorous seruice, whilst that I liu'd, What good once did I thee, what haue I done for thee ere? Tis no sense to bewaile the losse of one that deserues not, Who to none but himselfe, whilst that he liu'd did he loue. This is the cause my soule force my coarse to relinquish, For that he seruice small did (whilst he liu'd to my dame. Yet since this my wisht for death most happily hapneth, Since by my parting now, I from my griefe now doe part: Tis my fortune (for me too good) ah faire doe not enuie, Since that alone through death, happily, liue doth the soule. Wipe then thy faire eyes, and without shewe of a mourner, This my breathlesse Trunke, vnto the graue doe thou beare: Thrise happie Tombe, since he againe reuiues with a new life, Who (dead) leaueth his Loue rauished, him for to ioy. [(Faire) thou the heauens (like to thy selfe) mak'st faire] (Faire) thou the heauens (like to thy selfe) mak'st faire, So thou my Fortune blessest (thee) to loue: He vanquisht is not, though of Armour bare, When with the Sunne, his strength Mars dares not prooue. If I (thy Beauties slaue) my selfe right call, Who (thee t'adore) can blame my loyaltie? The selfe same God, that Louers worship all, Is that sweete God, which breeds their miserie. (Faire) then I loue thee, ah what ist I say? Ny more, I worship thee, and thee admire: My verse, and voyce, shall honour thee for aye, Sing still thy praise, thy glorie still desire. (Faire) it is much, the Gods for to resemble, But more to be, like Vertue; yet without Sage Pallas helpe, Ioue nere had made to tremble, Of furious Tytans, that rebellious Rout. To thee then like to Gods, to Vertue like, All praises wee'le ascribe, as guerdon right. [Withouten scope] Withouten scope, To haue the hopes My Ladie any more, Since cannot bee, That I may see, To death ile flie therefore. Sweet death now come, And to me runne. Since I to thee doe crie, Be thou my friend, That I may end These daies of miserie. Whilst I doe liue, I nought but grieue, Depriued of all ioy, How can that hart, Of ease haue part, When Loue doth him annoy? My sorrowes soure, My cries each houre, My soule doth pinch with paine, My heauie moanes, My sighes nor groanes, Can neuer moue my dame. Why then, so long, (Death) dost me wrong? That yet I am not dead, That man doth rest, Happie and blest, Whose soule from hence is fled. No worldly strife, No ill so rife, Can hurt who is in graue, Die he doth not, But life hath got, That such a good may haue. AN ODE. Worthy's hee of the bright Day, Who doth loyall LOVE obay. CVPID onely I doe loue, Him I worship still aboue: Happie is he that by the same, Wisedome to himselfe doth gaine. Worthy's hee of the bright Day, Who doth loyall LOVE obay. O how sweete is that warme Fire. Which our hearts heates with Desire? To our soules no sweetnes is, Halfe so dulcet as is this. Worthy's hee of the bright Day, Who doth loyall LOVE obay. Blessed LOVE, withouten crime, Two Soules pleaseth at one time: Then doth LOVE, his Louer right, When his loue hee doeth requite. Worthy's hee of the bright Day, Who doth loyall LOVE obay. Of two Soules hee makes but one, In two Bodies all alone: LOVE more happie cannot bee, Then wee louing Couples see. Worthy's hee of the bright Day, What doth loyall LOVE obay. Pleasure none vpon the ground, Like to LOVE is to be found: Pleasures passe as transitorie, LOVE (still) liues in great glorie. Worthy's hee of the bright Day, Who doth loyall LOVE obay. [Worthie is hee of darke Night] Worthie is hee of darke Night, That in Cupid doth delight. Nothing in this World can be, Sweeter then our Libertie: Which LOVE often takes away, And then all our ioyes decay. Worthie is hee of blacke Night, That in Cupid doeth delight. LOVE doth neuer sorrow misse, (Who grieues) malcontented is: But LOVE (thus) doth Louers sting, Doth not LOVE, then sorrow bring? Worthie is hee of Blacke Night, That in Cupid doth delight. Who that soule hath ere seene easde, Vpon whom fierce LOVE hath seasde? The Mistris and the Seruant both, Oft through LOVE, their liues doe loath. Worthie is hee of blacke Night, That in Cupid doth delight. Gods from heauen haue chast'e and sent, This vile wretch, vs to torment: Nor are wee him to endure, That such plagues vs, doth procure. Worthie is hee of blacke Night, That in Cupid doth delight. Then most wretched him I deeme, That of this blinde Boye doth steeme: Worser Plague there's not of ills, That consumes still, yet (nere) kills. Worthie is hee of blacke Night, That in Cupid takes delight. [My pittious eye (in wailing) nothing more] My pittious eye (in wailing) nothing more, Beholdeth faire, then thy diuinest grace: Nothing I see more sacred to adore, Then that pure vertue, that shines in thy face. For thee I liue, for thee I (willing) die, Wishing no Sunne to see, but for thy sake: But should I thee offend, then wretched I. Thus good, and ill, alike for thee I take. For so rare subiect as thy selfe diuine, My hart can neuer suffer ouermuch: Although these cares knawe this poore hart of mine, And (to the quicke) in euery part me touch. Happie is he that suffereth for pure Loue, For whilest he loues so, he himselfe doth finde Transformed into such beautie, as doth moue Life, whereas death before to him was signde. A Deitie, then beautie is aright, When it such wonders worketh in her sight. Another. (Cruell) for louing thee, ile end my daies, Since (dying) I shall liue still in thy beautie: Who dieth Conquerour merrits double praise, But farre more he, who dieth for louing duetie. Immortall glorie Piramus did gaine For this; besides his loyall chastitie Was much commended, when by death the same, Freede Thisbe from most wofull miserie. As he for her, so I for thee will doe, For thee ile die, of my chaste Loue the honour: And as the Phœnix ile consume for you, I (as himselfe) consuming, in that manner. Whilst of my bones so burned shall reuiue, Thousands of Louers created by this fire: Who for their constant Loue shall be aliue World without end, renowmed through true desire. [Since farre exilde from mee doth wound my soule] Since farre exilde from mee doth wound my soule, And that a mortall desperate straunge disease, Doth stealing seaze vpon my bloudlesse Coarse, What should I longer linger for to die? Since Death alone can cure this vncoth flame, Mine eies haue wept, mine hart hath sigh'd too much, My soule is wearied with enduring paine, Hee dieth not, that in dying ends all griefe. Those louely Eyes are now debasht from mee, So is that gratious, Fauour, more then faire, For whom I breath, and feede vpon this Aire, Blest is that man that then yeelds vp his Ghost, When as he findes himselfe in heauens disgrace, And seeth the Welkin for to wound him still, With mee shall wend into my Fatall Tombe, My bloody griefes, and more then dolefull Dule, And all those thoughts of her, who, when I liu'd, Made mee to prooue a worse then trebble Death. Let no man then seeme for to waile my losse, Since friendly Death by it my cares doth crosse. It is enough, since for my worthlesse Death, My Mistris faire, for beareth to lament, Nor grieues that I should part (so soone) her fro, Dead I should please her, better then when life Did soiourne in this earthly Inne of mine, And therefore I will end my loathed dayes. My prying Eyes, first authours of mine ill, My gentle hart, ore loyall in his loue, (As they deseru'd) sharpe paine shall first endure, Reason it is, that they who first offended, Should be inflicted with due punishment, For so the heauens will guerdon each aright. Cupid, doth vse for to abridge our dayes, Nor, for our woes, doth quit vs otherwise. First hee doth wound, and then he heales againe, By two Deuises, and both contraries: The first our heart burnes, th'other kills our strength, Th'one cruell is, the other's amiable. Blest is he, that LOVE serues, since (in one day) Hee happie, or vnhappie, make him may. [Vnto the soundlesse Vaults of Hell below] Vnto the soundlesse Vaults of Hell below, Ile waile my griefes (remedilesse) amaine: Whilst frightfull Ghosts, as pittifull shall shew, And Flintie Rocks, remorse take of my paine. Yea, Death it selfe, my bitter paines shall know, To witnesse that my life in noy hath laine. For Louers true, can neuer die indeed, Whose loyall hearts, a heauenly fire doth feed. My Coarse beeing layd along within my Graue, Shall shew his teares, his torments, and his loue: And (for his minde, did neuer change nor waue) Farre brighter then the Sunne, the same shall proue, By him the picture of his Lady he shall haue, Which (he being dead) afresh shall make him moue. Like to the fire, in ashes couered, Which (though it shew no flame) yet is not dead. LOVE is not tam'de by Death, but still doth liue, Although that life doth flit and passe away: Then (Lady) thinke not though by death (thou grieue My bodie) that thou LOVE canst make decay, As long as Fancie, doth thy beautie driue, Into my soule? No, this will bide for aye. Within my heart, thy beautie printed is, LOVE in my Tombe, to harbor will not misse. Thinkst thou, Ile leaue to loue thee being dead, When thy faire portraiture reuiues my sight? If mortall voice, from Tombes, haue some men lead, Restoring vnto them their senses right. Then how much more, ought LOVE be honoured, Whom (then the greatest Gods) is more of might? Then think not though my Corse in Vault thou see. That from thy loue, (as thou wouldst) I am free. Below in Monument still shalt thou heare, How I will sigh, for (without soule) thy Fire Shall hold mee vp; whilst liuing I'le appeare, (Being dead) as fore my death, I did desire. Nor deadly pangs thereof, will I once feare, Nor part from thee, as thou wouldst faine require. For in thy life, so cruell th'ast not beene, But in my Death, as loyall I'le be seene. Yet is my Fortune better farre then thine, For, without breach of Faith (as thou hast done) I shall haue leaue to plaine of sorrow mine, Thou thinkst (in killing mee a Martyrdome, More tedious (then before) mee to assigne, But th'art deceiu'd, a wrong Race hast thou runne. For whilst I liu'd, thy Rigour was my bane, But now being dead, I freed am from the same. Death then, both thee and mee preserues from ill, Thee, that no more thy Beautie I molest: Mee, that I feele not now thy cruell will, O happie Death, that two desires hath blest. Then let mee die, thy minde for to fulfill, Yet first I will, this Rock shall be possest, Of this my dolefull verse, true witnesse, How (vndeseru'd) I brought was to distresse. For though (to die) it shall mee mickle please, Yet must I grieue at thy lost Companie: Then Rocks, Caues, Woods, Groues, Springs, and greenie Leaze, Witnes you all, LOVE Arcas made to die. To noyse this in the world, doe neuer cease, If I report shall, where as dead I lie, How all of you (although by Nature wilde, Yet (then my Mistris) are more meeke and milde.</field>
