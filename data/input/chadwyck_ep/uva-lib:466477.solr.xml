      <field name="fulltext">VOL I. [VERSE EXTRACTED FROM MEMOIR] TO A FRIEND. Oh! poetry, sweet maid, who only deigns To smile upon the good, the innocent; To thee I fain would sing, to thee who oft Hast scattered roses o'er the rigid face Of youthful woe, for youth has still its griefs, And separation from the mother dear, Who oft has watched us in the hour of sleep, Will wet with sorrow's tear the cheek of youth, And teach his glowing bosom to repine. Oh! Ross, to thee I now address my song; To thee, companion of my earliest lays, My earliest efforts to awake the lyre. And though no glowing numbers here are found, The heart that dictates to my artless pen Is not less warm, less capable of friendship; And though my humble muse cannot presume To claim a sapling from Apollo's wreath, Yet, as the music of the tuneful choir May tempt the sparrow to pour forth his lay, And imitate the warblings of the thrush, So I, enchanted with the lofty lays Of abler poets, may attempt to touch The humble lyre of a rustic muse, And pour to thee my artless melody. Perhaps in future hours, when opprest With all the cares and crosses of the world, Sweet memory will recal the blissful days I spent with thee, and with the pensive muse. MONODY. Again, again, oh! let me hear you speak, Call me, embrace me, look on me again; My hand is on your forehead, it shall seek To give relief and mitigate your pain; And yours will soon press mine, 'tis only weak. Hope cannot be quite lost—life must remain. I see his bosom heave; I hear his breath— 'Tis sleep, 'tis stupor, anything but Death! It is not Death, though motionless he be, That may of ease and slumber be a token; No friendly glance now beams from those dim eyes, By those pale lips no feeble words are spoken; Far better were complaints and painful sighs, Than silence, silence never to be broken. Yet still he sleeps—we may in time restore— No—no—his sleep is Death, he wakes no more! My task is over, and I'll not repine, Since all his tedious pangs are at an end; Beside his bed I shall no more recline, To all his whisper'd wants no more attend; I ne'er shall see his moist eyes fixed on mine, In silent recognition of his friend; I never more shall cool his fever'd brow, Or bathe his cheeks—all, all is over now! He loved me like a brother, and I felt That I should watch him with a brother's care; His chamber was my own, I fondly dwelt Ever beside him, comforting him there. He sought my aid in all things, and I knelt, Morning and evening, joining him in prayer: Whilst tremulous and weak my voice was heard, He breathed with firm distinctness every word. He had no cause to tremble, for his mind (If man's can ever be so) was prepared. In health and strength affectionate and kind, All must have loved him; and in death he dared Look up with faith and hope, and was resigned To his Creator's will. He hath been spared The ills of a bad world; but we have lost One most beloved—'tis we who suffer most. When last we parted, his young heart was sad; But we were full of hope, that future days Would bring a happy meeting; and we had Delightful plans, projecting many ways Of being blest together; he was glad To press my hand, and he would often raise Schemes of unbounded pleasure, shared with me: This might have been—but this can never be! We thought of happy meetings, and we met, But never to be happy; grief and pain Had changed his cheerful face; my eyes were wet With tears I laboured to conceal in vain. I feel his feeble arms embrace me yet, Whilst mine were thrown around him, and again I hear him whisper, in a gentle tone, “My dear, dear friend, I never had but one.” I took a last sad look, and turned away, Leaving him in his grave. I used to share His innocent pursuits; and all the day Was happy by his side; yet he lies there Unconscious of the heavy griefs that prey Upon my wounded heart. My fervent prayer He hears not, “that the joys we hope above May be a state of bliss with those we love.” Ah! yes, we never, never could sustain The loss of those we value here below, Had we not Faith, that we shall meet again In a far better world;—it must be so. 'Tis this that soothes the sick man in his pain; 'Tis this alleviates the mourner's woe; And this shall be my comfort; though we sever, I felt—I feel—it cannot be for ever. And time that changes all things may subdue My present depth of anguish; I may rove With those who soothe my sorrow, and renew The smiles of former days, but I shall love In solitary hours to think of you, And sigh for past delights. We soon remove The mourner's sable garb; but none can know How long in secret lurks the mourner's woe. MOURNFUL RECOLLECTIONS. Oh, Time! I ask thee not to steal away My present grief—I wish not to be gay; Forgetfulness alone can cure regret, And whilst I live, I never can forget. Yes, tears will flow, philosophy in vain May strive to teach forgetfulness of pain; We hear the cold advice which strangers give, Mere words—which all bestow—and none receive. We listen while they speak,—when they are gone The heart still aches, and tears will still flow on. Each book, each plant, each trifle, we behold, Is hallowed by the touch of hands now cold. Yet leave these relics—seek in change of scene A potent spell to make your griefs less keen. Quit all your lost friend valued, and remove Each trifle that reminds you of his love. Roam o'er the world, new friends, new joys, to find, Laugh and be gay—but first leave thought behind. If change avails not, seek employment then, Your books, your walks, your pencil, or your pen: You read—and seek the volumes of his choice— Where is that one who listened to your voice? You walk—but whilst you view each lovely scene Where is the arm on which you used to lean? You draw—but still those scenes your choice must be, Which e'en in darkness you distinctly see. You write—but now the subject of your lay, Is friendship lost, and pleasure pass'd away. Some may pass on through life, and quickly find New ties replacing those they leave behind: One they called friend may sink into the tomb, And only cause a momentary gloom; Awhile they miss in every gay pursuit The voice once lively, now for ever mute; Or in the scenes where they have often met, They deign to breathe a word of cold regret; But soon their transient, heartless sorrow ends, They seek for other joys with other friends. It is an easy task, for hearts at rest, To talk of brighter days to the distressed; To shew us joys the future may reveal, And speak of that composure which they feel. They may remind us, tears and sighs are vain— Alas! can hopelessness diminish pain? They say, when God afflicts us, it is fit That men should suffer meekly, and submit. Yes, we submit, and place our trust alone In one last hope—to go where they are gone. We know his dispensations must be borne, We bow to his behest,—yet still we mourn. Religion teaches us to hope for bliss— But in another region—not in this. When I at last beheld his coffin thrust Into its narrow dwelling—dust to dust, When motionless I stood upon the brink Of his cold grave and wept, I could not think That the mind's purity would pass away, And, like the body, totally decay: No—that pure spirit which was wont to shed A charm o'er all he did, and all he said; That excellence which made him dear to me, Was formed for life and immortality. The mortal part may seek its loathsome prison, The soul—the part of him we loved, is risen, Gone—where the pure in heart again shall meet; Ah, yes!—our prospect would be incomplete, Did we not hope to share the perfect bliss Of that bright world, with friends so dear in this, And recognize those forms in realms above, Who claimed on earth our fondest, purest love. [If any poet can express] If any poet can express Helena's worth and loveliness To him I leave these spotless pages; Were I to labour here for ages, Language could ne'er convey my thought, I could not praise her as I ought. [Oh! think not, Helena, of leaving us yet] Oh! think not, Helena, of leaving us yet, Though many fair damsels inhabit our Isle, Alas! there are none who can make us forget The grace of thy form, and the charm of thy smile. The toys of the French, if they hither are sent, Are endeared by the payment of Custom House duties. Ah! why do not duty and custom prevent The rash exportation of pure British Beauties? Say is there not one (midst the many who sighed To solicit your favour) one favourite beau? And have you to all, who popp'd questions, replied, With that chilling, unkind monosyllable, no? Your mansion with exquisite swains has been thronged, With smiles they approach you, in tears they depart, Indeed, it is said, that a man who belonged To the Tenth, sighed in vain for a tithe of your heart. And are you still happy? could no one be found, Whose vows full of feeling could teach you to feel? A girl so expert at inflicting a wound Should surely be now and then willing to heal. Then leave us not; shall a foreigner own The form we have worshipped as if 'twere divine? No, no, thou art worthy a Briton alone, And where is the Briton who would not be thine? The sordid will come to thee:—yield not to them, Nor give up thy heart, though they earnestly ask it, But say to them, “Gentlemen—is it the gem That you wish to possess, or the dross of the casket?” Their hearts are not rent, no, their wounds would be small Were it not for your rents that they wish to possess. They're very sincere, for undoubtedly all Feel an interest for you they cannot express. Yet, pretty Helena, you must not evade All Lovers, disgusted by lovers of pelf; Go look in thy mirror, and own thou wert made To be loved with devotion, and loved for thyself. [He is gone! the bright star of a nation is hurled] He is gone! the bright star of a nation is hurled From its proud elevation; its lustre is dim. He is cold as the sod where he sleeps, and this world With its scorn, or its laurels, is nothing to him. And both have been his, in the dawn of his life He has grasped, he hath gained the green garland of fame, While slander hath struggled with pitiful strife To point out his errors, and sully his name. He hath tasted the cup of calamity too, And its bitterness poisoned his earliest years; In the withering gloom of his numbers we view, The grief of a spirit too noble for tears. He was rash, and his feelings too proudly disdained One moment's subjection to reason's control; As well might a wave of the ocean be chained In its stormy career, as so daring a soul. He hath felt, and the world loved to tear off the veil From his agonized feelings, and laugh them to scorn: It spoke of his follies, and what was the tale? He had erred,—was an exile,—unhappy,—forlorn. And oh! if indeed it be true, that a mind So ennobled by genius, rejected belief In that God, through whose infinite mercy mankind Can alone find a solace in sickness or grief, May that mind ere its last fatal moment have felt All its error; and spurning mortality's chain, May the sinner's first prayer have been heard while he knelt At that throne, where a penitent pleads not in vain Had he lived, he might yet have shone gloriously forth, And those talents which oft have been lavishly given To gild all the fleeting enjoyments of earth, Might at length have devoted their brightness to Heaven. [Go, little Ruby Heart! and live] Go, little Ruby Heart! and live As dear Helena's guest, And tell her I would gladly give The world to be as blest. Say also she must not forget (Since heartless I depart) That she is deeply in my debt, The item is—a heart. And tell her too I shall be glad To dun her when we meet; And if she'll pay me, I will add, My hand to the receipt. [Dear Duchess] Dear Duchess, I hope that your grace will permit Your servant in exile to scribble a bit: Yet hope not to find an amusing detail Of the joys of the country—pigs, poultry, and ale; I fain would amuse you; but what can I do? I'm dull, but remember I'm absent from you. I walk in the fields with the cows and the sheep, I struggle through ditches both dirty and deep; I gaze on the prospect, the mountains of Wales, The Severn besprinkled with snowy white sails; The cottages, too, with pretty spring flowers, And Thornbury Castle with turreted towers; But where is Rosetta, the Queen of the May? With form so bewitching, with spirits so gay, And with eyes in whose gentle expression we find The beauty that beams from a beautiful mind. Ah! where is Rosetta? in pleasure's gay path, She roves in the Crescent, the idol of Bath; While I look on donkies, or curly-tailed pigs, She gazes on lovers who rumble in gigs, Or those who on foot approach enviably near, And breathe the soft language of love in her ear. And does she forget me? Fly, Ruby Heart, fly! And say, if she smiles upon others—I die: Bid her seek the back drawing-room, there she will see The Beacon that ought to remind her of me. Go, show her the roses I gave her, as yet They cannot be withered, and can she forget? Go teach her white fingers to touch my guitar, And tell her to think that its cadences are The voices of sweet little seraphs who say, Forget not poor Felix who sighs far away. [Oh may'st thou be happy, my early young friend] Oh may'st thou be happy, my early young friend, As happy as man in this world can be; May smiles like thine own thy steps attend, May hearts like thine own still welcome thee! I never have met on this chilling earth, So merry, so kind, so frank a youth! In moments of pleasure, a smile all mirth; In moments of sorrow, a heart all truth. I've heard thee praised, I've seen thee led By fashion along her gay career; While beautiful lips have often shed Their flattering poison in thine ear. And oh! I have said, he must be changed, He cannot withstand this constant praise; He must be spoilt, and his heart estranged From the friends he loved in his boyish days. But no! when we met, I found thee still From vanity's vile contagion free; With manners that asked and gave good will, And pleased by their pure simplicity. Farewell, my friend! may thy youthful bride, As perfect in mind as in person prove; And in years to come, may'st thou look with pride On the being whose charms have won thy love. Yes—may'st thou be happy, my early friend, As happy as man in this world can be; May smiles like thine own, thy steps attend, May hearts like thine own still welcome thee. [Cling to the Cross, thou lone one] Cling to the Cross, thou lone one, For a solace in thy grief; Let faith believe its promise, There is joy in that belief. Oh lie not down, poor mourner, On the cold earth in despair; Why give the grave thy homage? Does the spirit moulder there? The unbeliever trusts not The atonement of the Cross: Say, where shall he find comfort, In the gloom of such a loss? Can He cheer his house of mourning, With the madden'd cry of mirth? No! he throws himself despairing On his all, a clod of earth. Cling to the Cross, thou lone one, For it hath power to save. If the Christian's hope forsake thee, There's no hope beyond the grave. TO MRS. AMES. Her ball is fixed for Friday— My angel wife exclaims; May I believe the tidings? Oh thank you, Mrs. Ames. She has sent out her servant, (I can't remember names) Oh what do you call the fellow? Your own man, Mrs. Ames. John, Thomas, William, Robert, Jehosophat, or James, No matter—she has sent him With cards from Mrs. Ames. And he'll ride round the country (Unless his nag he lames), Inviting all the neighbourhood To wait on Mrs. Ames. I trust your cold is better. Oh! vain were sportive games, Unless you can enjoy them; Then sneeze not, Mrs. Ames. Take Ipecacuhana, Or powders made by James Take tea, and toast-and-butter Take comfort, Mrs. Ames. Shake off your influenza, Most beautiful of dames; For Gunter's man is coming. Behold him, Mrs. Ames. For needful preparations The dining-room he claims; We'll bivouac above stairs; That's cosey, Mrs. Ames! But I must tie my neckcloth; I hear the people's names, Announced by Payn, the butler, Oh! Presto, Mrs. Ames. [I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song!] I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song! I've bent beneath sorrow's cold pressure too long. I've suffered in silence; how vainly I sought For words to unburthen the anguish of thought; Despair haunts the silent endurance of wrong I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song! I welcome thee back as the Dove to the Ark: The world was a desert, the future all dark; But I know that the worst of the storm must be past, Thou art come with the green leaf of comfort at last. Around me thy radiant imagining throng, I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song! I feared thee, sweet Spirit! I thought thou would'st come With memory's records of boyhood and home; The home where I laughed away youth, and was told It would still be my dwelling place when I grew old; But visions of hope to thy coming belong, I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song! Thou wilt not, sweet Spirit! thou wilt not, I know, Mislead to the fruitless indulgence of woe, That shrinks from the smile that would offer relief, And seems to be proud of pre-eminent grief— Thou'lt soothe the depression already too strong: I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song! There's a chord that I never must venture to wake, The sorrow a loved one hath borne for my sake; But her love, which no change in my fortunes could chill, Her smile of affection that follows me still, Oh! these are the themes I may proudly prolong, I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song! I welcome thee back, and again I look forth With my wonted delight on the blessings of earth; Again I can smile with the gay and the young; The lamp is relighted, the harp is restrung. Despair haunts the silent endurance of wrong, I welcome thee back again, Spirit of Song! [Oh! hadst thou never shared my fate] Oh! hadst thou never shared my fate, More dark that fate would prove, My heart were truly desolate, Without thy soothing love. But thou hast suffer'd for my sake, Whilst this relief I found Like fearless lips that strive to take The poison from a wound! My fond affection thou hast seen, Then judge of my regret, To think more happy thou hadst been, If we had never met. And has that thought been shar'd by thee! Ah no, that smiling cheek Proves more unchanging love for me Than labour'd words could speak. But there are true hearts which the sight Of sorrow summons forth; Though known in days of past delight, We knew not half their worth. How unlike some, who have profess'd, So much in friendship's name; Yet calmly pause to think how best They may evade her claim. But ah! from them to thee I turn; They'd make me loathe mankind. Far better lessons I may learn From thy more holy mind. The love that gives a charm to home, I feel they cannot take. We'll pray for happier years to come, For one another's sake. [Old Boat! I wish a lot were mine] Old Boat! I wish a lot were mine, In youth and age resembling thine: When young and strong, like thee to glide Over a calm and sunny tide. For innocent enjoyment fram'd, Pleasure nam'd with me, when I'm nam'd. A cheerful aspect still I'd wear, Sought by the youthful and the fair; And offering to every guest, A shelter and a place of rest. ['Twas in a happy summer hour] 'Twas in a happy summer hour, I watched the building of the bower. No mansion raised for vain display, Nor one where labour works his way, But formed to be the home of pleasure, Where Virtue spends her blameless leisure. Farewell, dear friends, oft may we meet Hereafter in this calm retreat; May every year add something bright To your pure portion of delight. Ah! may you in your daughters find The mother's form, the mother's mind. Look on your sons, and proudly see Their father's high integrity. And blest with this delightful thought By us, their virtues have been taught. Farewell! henceforth each dweller here Shall to my heart be very dear, Remembering whene'er I roam, Cintra has been to me a home. [May the young Queen be happy, and calm her renown] I May the young Queen be happy, and calm her renown, While the sword in the scabbard reposes; On the forehead of youth may the sovereign crown Press no more than a chaplet of roses. May the Arts, as they did in Elizabeth's reign, Shed around intellectual glory; And Victoria's annals be free from the stain Of the errors that darkened her story. May the young Queen be happy, unsullied her court, And the love of her people her pride and support! II May the young Queen be happy! should peace pass away Not a heart in her kingdom would falter; Her voice would call forth a triumphant array, In defence of the throne and the altar. But laurels enough ready gathered we find; And no spark of right feeling he loses, Who prays that the olive may now be entwin'd With the evergreen wreath of the Muses. May the young Queen be happy, unsullied her court, And the love of her people her pride and support! LOVES OF THE BUTTERFLIES. I. I'D BE A BUTTERFLY BORN IN A BOWER. I'd be a Butterfly born in a bower, Where roses and lilies and violets meet; Roving for ever from flower to flower, And kissing all buds that are pretty and sweet! I'd never languish for wealth, or for power; I'd never sigh to see slaves at my feet: I'd be a Butterfly born in a bower, Kissing all buds that are pretty and sweet. O could I pilfer the wand of a fairy, I'd have a pair of those beautiful wings: Their summer-day's ramble is sportive and airy, They sleep in a rose when the nightingale sings. Those, who have wealth, must be watchful and wary; Power, alas! nought but misery brings! I'd be a Butterfly sportive and airy, Rock'd in a rose when the nightingale sings! What, though you tell me each gay little rover Shrinks from the breath of the first autumn day! Surely 'tis better, when summer is over, To die when all fair things are fading away. Some in life's winter may toil to discover Means of procuring a weary delay— I'd be a Butterfly; living, a rover, Dying when fair things are fading away! II. OH! FOLLY CAUGHT ME, AS I SLEPT. Oh! Folly caught me, as I slept, Upon a lilac spray; And spurned me, when his hand had swept My golden down away. Look at my bruised and broken wing, 'Twill bear me hence no more: The flowers will bloom, the birds will sing, But my summer-flight is o'er. Alas! alas! how very brief Is pleasure's brightest ray! The sun, that warms the summer-leaf, Will hasten its decay. I was the Insect-Queen, and oft On me admirers gazed; And, as in sport I soar'd aloft, My beauty has been praised. But other triflers will be found To grace the garden now; And other wings will hover round My own sweet lilac bough. Alas! alas! how very brief Is pleasure's brightest ray! The sun, that warms the summer-leaf, Will hasten its decay. III. BUTTERFLY BEAU. I'm a volatile thing, with an exquisite wing, Sprinkled o'er with the tints of the rainbow; All the Butterflies swarm to behold my sweet form, Though the Grubs may all vote me a vain beau. I my toilet go through, with my rose-water dew, And each blossom contributes its essence; Then all fragrance and grace, not a plume out of place, I adorn the gay world with my presence— In short, you must know, I'm the Butterfly Beau. At first I enchant a fair Sensitive plant, Then I flirt with the Pink of perfection: Then I seek a sweet Pea, and I whisper; “For thee “I have long felt a fond predilection.” A Lily I kiss, and exult in my bliss, But I very soon search for a new lip; And I pause in my flight to exclaim with delight, “Oh! how dearly I love you, my Tulip!” In short, you must know, I'm the Butterfly Beau. Thus for ever I rove, and the honey of love From each delicate blossom I pilfer; But though many I see pale and pining for me, I know none that are worth growing ill for: And though I must own, there are some that I've known, Whose external attractions are splendid; On myself I must doat, for in my pretty coat All the tints of the garden are blended— In short, you must know, I'm the Butterfly Beau. IV. ROUND MY OWN PRETTY ROSE. Round my own pretty Rose I have hover'd all day; I have seen its sweet leaves one by one fall away; They are gone—they are gone—but I go not with them; No, I linger to weep o'er the desolate stem. They say—‘If I rove to the South, I shall meet With hundreds of Roses more fair and more sweet:’ But my heart, when I'm tempted to wander, replies; “Here my first love—my last love—my only love lies.” When I sprang from the home where my plumage was nurst, 'Twas my own pretty Rose that attracted me first. We have loved all the summer; and now that the chill Of the winter comes o'er us, I'm true to thee still. When the last leaf is wither'd, and falls to the earth, The false one to southerly climes may fly forth: But Truth cannot fly from his sorrow; he dies, Where his first love—his last love—his only love lies. V. MY OWN BLUE BELL! MY PRETTY BLUE BELL! My own Blue Bell! my pretty Blue Bell! I never will rove where Roses dwell: My wings you view of your own bright hue, And oh! never doubt that my heart's true blue! Though oft I own, I have foolishly flown To peep at each bud that was newly blown; I now have done with folly and fun, For there's nothing like constancy under the sun, My own Blue Bell! my pretty Blue Bell! I never will rove where Roses dwell: My wings you view of your own bright hue, And oh! never doubt that my heart's true blue! Some Belles are Blues, invoking the muse, And talking of vast intellectual views; Their crow-quill's tip in the ink they dip, And they prate with the lore of a learned lip: Blue bells like these may be wise as they please, But I love my own Blue Bell that bends in the breeze: Pride passes her by—but she charms my eye With a tint, that resembles the cloudless sky. My own Blue Bell! my pretty Blue Bell! I never will rove where Roses dwell: My wings you view of your own bright hue, And oh! never doubt that my heart's true blue! VI. LONG AGO, ERE MY WINGS WERE UNFURL'D. Long ago, ere my wings were unfurl'd, When I lay in a chrysalis state; I was ugly, neglected, unfit for the world, And despised by the gay and the great: If I ventured to utter a word, My voice in an instant was hush'd; And, when trampled upon, it was voted absurd In a Grub to resist being crush'd. But my fortunes improved, and I rose In the world on the wings of success; And I very soon found I was follow'd by those, Who once laugh'd at my manners and dress: The blossoms of beauty, that spurn'd Long ago so degrading a match, Now when I perch'd near to them, smilingly turn'd; For they thought me a pretty good catch. This, I own, is a fanciful theme; Yet 'tis not without meaning, you'll find: For the loves of the Butterflies, small though they seem, May resemble the loves of mankind— The Grub, that is slighted to-day As a suitor presuming and bold, May perhaps be received in a different way, When soaring on pinions of gold. VII. THE BUTTERFLY WAS A GENTLEMAN. The Butterfly was a gentleman, Of no very good repute; And he roved in the sunshine all day long, In his scarlet and purple suit: And he left his lady-wife at home In her own secluded bower; Whilst he, like a bachelor, flirted about With a kiss for every flower. His lady-wife was a poor glow-worm, And seldom from home she'd stir; She loved him better than all the world, Though little he cared for her. Unheeded she pass'd the day—she knew Her lord was a rover then; But, when night came on, she lighted her lamp To guide him over the glen. One night the wanderer homeward came, But he saw not the glow-worm's ray: Some wild-bird saw the neglected one, And flew with her far away. Then beware, ye Butterflies all, beware If to you such a time should come: Forsaken by wandering lights, you'll wish You had cherish'd the lamp at home. VIII. EACH BOWER HAS BEAUTY FOR ME. Each bower has beauty for me, There's a charm in each blossom that blows; And, if absent the Lily should be, I shall do very well with the Rose: If Roses are not in the way, I'll fly to a Hyacinth soon; And I never will quarrel with May, For wanting the Roses of June. No! no! 'tis my pleasure to chase Each pretty bud under the sun: Why should I insult the whole race, By a silly selection of one? I love each exotic, that deigns In a climate like this to expand; And my heart its affection retains For the bloom of my dear native land: In summer's gay mansions I dwell, And since summer so soon will be past, Though I love her first bud very well, I have love in reserve for her last. Yes! yes! 'tis my pleasure to chase Each pretty bud under the sun: Why should I offend the whole race, By a silly selection of one? IX. ONE MORN I LEFT MY BOAT, TO STRAY. One morn I left my boat, to stray In yon island's dewy bowers; I cull'd its sweets, and sail'd away With my stolen store of flowers: The west wind bore me o'er the flood, My prize from the sun I shaded; But, ere evening came, the fairest bud In my lovely wreath was faded! That eve, when nought but sea and sky In the dreary prospect blended, A little blue-wing'd Butterfly Upon the deck descended; It nestled near the Rose, its wing Then lost its buoyant power; And I saw the insect withering Beside its own poor flower. MELODIES OF VARIOUS NATIONS. HARK! FROM YONDER HOLY PILE. (Portuguese Air.) I Hark! from yonder holy pile Wedding-bells are ringing; White-rob'd forms, who crowd the aisle, Solemn chaunts are singing. See the happy bride appear— Yet her footsteps falter; Wherefore should she shed a tear, At the sacred altar? 'Tis not that she wishes now From her love to sever; 'Tis—that should he break his vow, She is lost for ever. II Causeless are thy fears, fair bride, Vain the doubts that grieve thee; View him kneeling at thy side, Think not he'll deceive thee. Binding be his bridal oath, And his love increasing; And may Heav'n bestow on both Pleasures never ceasing! May that hand protect thee still, Thine now fondly pressing; And in ev'ry earthly ill, Be thy guard and blessing! III Youth! the hope her bosom knows Dies if you forsake her; Never let her sigh for those From whose arms you take her. All her fondness ne'er forget, E'en when youth is over; Never let the wife regret That she bless'd the lover. May thy cares to her alone Frankly be confided; May the ties that make you one Never be divided! THEY MAY TALK OF SCENES THAT ARE BRIGHT AND FAIR. (French Air.) I They may talk of scenes that are bright and fair, Where summer seems always shining; And art may spread its attractions there, With the beauties of nature combining: But a charm to me has never appear'd In the most romantic places, Till a cheerful voice was distinctly heard, And I look'd upon friendly faces. Of the smoothest lakes, and the greenest trees, The eye must in time be weary; With friends we can live without things like these, For the prospect can never be dreary. II Whene'er we look back upon former days, And the joys that once were dearest; 'Midst those which mem'ry oft surveys, Our friends appear first and clearest: We cease to remember the sweetest spot, If it offer'd seclusion only; Earth's loveliest bowers delight us not, If those bowers are always lonely. A scene may be fair, but we still need one To be near to us while we view it: So a garden may bloom, but it needs a sun To give splendour and freshness to it. III To me those places have brightest seem'd, Where cheerfulness most abounded, Where eyes with pleasure have often beam'd, And the voice of mirth resounded: The simplest pleasures must welcome be When a friendly hand prepares them; Gay scenes can never be gay to me Till a lov'd companion shares them; For a charm to me has never appear'd In the most romantic places, Till a cheerful voice was distinctly heard, And I look'd upon friendly faces. THOUGH NOW WE PART. (Unknown Air.) I Though now we part, My sanguine heart Looks forward to a brighter day, When time shall heal The wounds we feel, And sorrow pass away. Though deep regret Must linger yet, And darken half the days we see, In all I do I'll live for you, And you must live for me. And surely thus Life offers us Some comfort for the ills we've had; For whilst we're dear To others here, We cannot be quite sad. II These days, alas! Too soon will pass; Yet, when I leave thee, ne'er repine; Where'er I rove, The links of love Shall still as fondly twine. Then murmur not, For love has got Elastic links that never part; Go where we will, They lengthen still, And fasten round the heart. Then, though we part, My sanguine heart Looks forward to a brighter day, When time shall heal The wounds we feel, And sorrow pass away. III When grief destroys Our fickle joys, And throws a shade o'er all we touch, To weary men Hope offers then Her anchor for a crutch: And as we glide Along life's tide, And mourn the balmy breath that's gone, Whene'er we fail, Hope fills our sail, And gently wafts us on. Then, though we part, My sanguine heart Looks forward to a brighter day, When time shall heal The wounds we feel, And sorrow pass away. OH, DO NOT GIVE WAY TO THE SHADOWS OF CARE (Tyrolese Air.) I Oh, do not give way to the shadows of care! They will darken the dawn of your happiest hours; Count the flowers which are strew'd in your path, but beware How you reckon the thorns which are under the flowers. The thorns which you tread on may wound you to-day, But to-morrow may offer some balm for the wound; And think not, when sunshine enlivens your way, That embryo tempests are gathering round. II You blame me, and say that my spirits are light, That I trifle with all the dark shadows you see; But if in my prospect one portion is bright, Dear Anna! it borrows its brightness from thee: And when Care in his course pays a visit to us, Your name ever proves an omnipotent spell; And I banish despondency, arguing thus— “Oh, I love one who loves me, and all will be well!” III Then look forward like me—I will never despond, Till your lips shall have cancell'd our mutual vow; There's a tranquil futurity smiling beyond The light clouds that appear to encircle us now: Though the mists of the morning the skies may obscure, Though the sun for a while may with storms be o'ercast, Yet at noon he'll shine forth more majestic and pure, From the transient eclipse he unsullied has pass'd. IN HOURS OF GRIEF, WHEN EV'RY THOUGHT RENEWS. (Italian Air.) I In hours of grief, when ev'ry thought renews A host of treasur'd joys we're doom'd to lose, Hope fades away, her soothing smiles are vain, Time seems to feel the weight of Sorrow's chain. Why does Time move so slow in mournful years? His wings are heavy, they are wet with tears: But in life's sunshine, when with fond delay We wish to linger in the flow'ry way, His rapid plumage wafts him on so fast, That, ere we feel him present, Time is past. II In Anna's absence, when each thought is gloom, Save one dear thought of meetings yet to come, Life like a polar winter wears away, In ceaseless night, without one sunny ray; I feel becalm'd upon a waveless sea, Far from the happy scenes belov'd by me. But Oh! in Anna's presence, when at last Our joys atone for countless sorrows past, Swift fly the hours, and, ere the anxious heart Can feel that we have met—'tis time to part. ISABEL. (Spanish Air.) I Wake, dearest, wake! and, again united, We'll rove by yonder sea; And where our first vows of love were plighted Our last farewell shall be. There oft I've gaz'd on thy smiles delighted, And there I'll part from thee, Isabel! II Dark is my doom; and from thee I sever, Whom I have lov'd alone: 'Twere cruel to link thy fate for ever With sorrows like my own. Go—smile on more lively friends, and never Lament me when I'm gone, Isabel! III And when at length in these lonely bowers Some happier youth you see, And you cull for him spring's sweetest flowers, And he sings of love for thee; When you laugh with him at these vanish'd hours, O! tell him to love like me, Isabel! IV May his harp in mirthful moments bless thee With measures light and gay; And if mournful thoughts should e'er oppress thee, And cloud thy youthful day, May he with unchanging love caress thee, And kiss thy tears away, Isabel! YOUTH'S BOSOM, WHEN JOY FLOURISHES. (French Air.) I Youth's bosom, when joy flourishes, Feels as if it were made for him; In the visions his heart nourishes Nothing is dark or dim: The only sounds he loves to hear Are those which fill the soul with bliss; Whilst smiling friends surround him here, No world can equal this, Thus wandering, still endeavouring Never to think that mortals die, Death seems like a blight, severing Every human tie. II When one whom he lov'd perishes, Former joys from his grasp are hurl'd; Then the sorrowing heart cherishes Thoughts of a purer world; And pleasure loses all the spells Which dazzle youth's delighted eye, Whilst all he looks on sadly tells Of pleasure long gone by. No more we view death fearfully, But like a path where danger lies, When friends seek it we move cheerfully, Following all we prize. III Where then are the tints hovering Over the path of early years? Where then is the veil covering Sorrows and fruitless tears? Those early tints disperse, and leave The shades that end our childish mirth; The veil is gone—and we perceive The checquered scenes of earth. Oh! when from the heart chillingly Fall the blossoms of hope and love, Then it shrinks from the world, willingly Soaring to hopes above. CAN WE BANISH THE PAST? CAN WE EVER RENOUNCE. (Bohemian Air.) I Can we banish the past? can we ever renounce The friends and the pleasures belov'd by us once? Ah! no: we in sorrow seek comfort alone, In all that reminds us of days that are gone. Let us talk of her then; 'tis a theme ever dear; And we'll whisper her name till we fancy her here: Surrounded by objects that endear'd by her touch, We can never lament her, or love her too much. II Come, sing me the songs which she often has heard, The past will revive with each note and each word; If the future can offer no brightness to us, We may steal a sad comfort from memory thus. There are some who shrink back from such records with dread; It is wise, if they wish not to think of the dead: But dearest in death, as in life she must be, And all that she valued is valued by me! III O touch not her harp! it has ever remain'd, Since the hour that she left it, unmov'd, unprofan'd; Not a hand o'er its strings has been suffer'd to stray, It would chase her last thrilling vibration away: Then awake not its music, for Oh! there's a tone, There's a spell which belongs to that one harp alone; But the spirit that call'd forth its sweetness is fled, And its cadence would sound like a voice from the dead. IV Oh, touch not her harp! 'tis my only delight, And I hear its sad notes 'mid the silence of night; Her voice seems to utter her favourite words, And her finger's soft pressure seems still on the chords: And I fancy her then, as she shone upon earth, In the bloom of her beauty, the dawn of her worth; Not a soul was more pure, not a form was more fair— In the haunts of the lovely, the loveliest there! V In that city, “At Pompeii we entered what is called a coffee-house, the marks of cups being visible on the stone.” “A barrack for soldiers, the columns of which are scribbled with their names and jests.”—Travels in Italy, Greece, and the Ionian Isles, by H. W. Williams, Esq. which, whilst in its splendour it stood, Vesuvius whelm'd in its withering flood, The projects of life, and mirth's liveliest breath, Were changed in an instant to darkness and death. Yet the wine-cup still stands in the desolate halls, And the names which in pastime were carv'd on the walls; For the relics of life and enjoyment will last Long after life's transient enjoyments are past. VI It was thus with my heart when the prospect was gay, The hopes that were dear to me melted away; Where joy seem'd to shine, I met nothing but gloom, And the friend who had lov'd me was cold in her tomb: Yet here I see all that her fancy preferr'd, And this is the room where her accents were heard; And whilst we are here, though of pleasure bereft, We feel that the relics of pleasure are left. WHEN METEOR-LIGHTS DANCE O'ER THE FEN. (German Air.) I. When meteor-lights dance o'er the fen, I guide the twinkling ray; I haunt the path of wand'ring men, And lead their steps astray: When lovers meet to whisper, then I prattle all they say; We vanish in some shady glen Before the dawn of day. We know the token which unites Two hearts—no longer two; We tell the tar on stormy nights His absent love is true; We fan the flame of beacon lights, And all his hopes renew: When maiden ladies dream of sprites, We make the lamps burn blue. II. I make the pallid misers quake, In golden chains who dwell; Ere mortal hopes are hatch'd, I break The unsubstantial shell: Before the dawn, the dew I shake From heath and purple bell; When stolen kisses rustics take, We make them kiss and tell. We know the token which unites, Two hearts—no longer two; We tell the tar on stormy nights His absent love is true; We fan the flame of beacon lights, And all his hopes renew: When maiden ladies dream of sprites, We make the lamps burn blue. IT IS IN THE VOICE OF YEARS THAT ARE GONE. (Swiss Air.) I “It is” in “the voice of years that are gone,” “It is the voice of years that are gone.”—Ossian. In the tale that descends from father to son, We enrol for ever the hero's name, And circle his tomb with the laurel of fame. II His glory time's progress diminishes not, His actions survive without stain, without blot; The banner and trophy shall over him wave, And the tears of his country shall water his grave. III His name is the beacon that shines from afar, To encourage our sons 'mid the dangers of war; To teach them to do as their fathers have done, And to live in “the voice of years that are gone.” IV Hast thou gaz'd on the sea in the stillness of night, When the moon o'er the waves throws a tremulous light; When a long line of glory shines radiantly through The expanse of the ocean's more shadowy blue? V Oh! as bright as the radiance that beams o'er the flood, Is the course which is trod by the great and the good; And as purely the light of their valour and worth Shines forth 'mid the spiritless shadows of earth. IN HAPPIER HOURS. (German Air.) I In happier hours, My pleasure all day Was to rove with the thoughtless, Or dance with the gay; Through life, as I sported, No clouds I could see, And the hearts that were gayest Were dearest to me. But now, in affliction, How chang'd is the view! Though gay hearts are many, Sincere ones are few II Though some come around us To laugh and to jest, In sickness or sorrow They shrink from the test; Their love and their friendship Endures for a while; While fortune is smiling, They also can smile; Like flowers that wither When daylight is gone, And lose all their sweetness When out of the sun. III But you in my sorrow Still faithfully came, And, though I am alter'd, I find you the same; Whene'er you come near me No pleasure you find, Yet always leave something Like pleasure behind: Like the night-blowing Cereus, Which sheds its perfume, And opens its blossoms 'Mid darkness and gloom. TO THE HOME OF MY CHILDHOOD IN SORROW I CAME. (Sicilian Air.) I To the home of my childhood in sorrow I came, And I fondly expected to find it the same— Full of sunshine and joy, as I thought it to be In the days when the world was all sunshine to me: Those scenes were unalter'd by time, and I stood Looking down on the village half hid by the wood; That happy abode, where I us'd to possess A father's affection, a mother's caress. II To others those scenes are as bright as before, But I can rejoice in their brightness no more; I stand in the home of my childhood alone, For the friends of my childhood are all of them gone: 'Twas joy shar'd by others—the laugh and the jest That gave to this spot all the charms it possess'd; And here the remembrance oppresses me most, Of all I once valued—of all I have lost. III How vain was my pray'r, that the place might retain Its delights—if I e'er should behold it again! Those who made it delightful no longer are near, And loneliness seems so unnatural here. Thus he who in age in a ball-room has been, Where in youth his gay spirit gave life to the scene, Is sad, though the scene is unchang'd,—and to him The dance must be cheerless, the brilliancy dim. IV Oh! where are the scenes, ever happy and new, And the eye with felicity always in view, And the juvenile thoughtlessness, laughing at fear, Which reign'd in my bosom when last I was here? And where are the hopes that I us'd to enjoy, The hopes of a light-hearted spirited boy; When the present and past had as little of gloom As I then thought of finding in moments to come? GO, MY OWN DARLING BOY. (Irish Air.) I Go, my own darling boy, Though to see thee depart Blights the last bud of joy In my desolate heart: Thou art call'd to the field Where thy father was slain; And thy mother must yield All she values again. II My child only thinks Of the conqueror's wreath; My coward heart shrinks With forebodings of death; Thy friends may be seen Giving laurels to thee; But branches as green Will then wave over me. III The young may assuage Half their parting regrets; But care clings to age Till it doats, and forgets: The young who deplore, May yet meet thee in joy; But thy mother no more Shall behold thee, dear boy! THINK NOT OF THE FUTURE, THE PROSPECT IS UNCERTAIN. (Welsh Air.) I Think not of the future, the prospect is uncertain; Laugh away the present, while laughing hours remain: Those who gaze too boldly through Time's mystic curtain Soon will wish to close it, and dream of joy again. I, like thee, was happy, and, on hope relying, Thought the present pleasure might revive again; But receive my counsel! Time is always flying, Then laugh away the present, while laughing hours remain. II I have felt unkindness, keen as that which hurts thee; I have met with friendship fickle as the wind; Take what friendship offers ere its warmth deserts thee; Well I know the kindest may not long be kind. Would you waste the pleasure of the summer season, Thinking that the winter must return again If our summer's fleeting, surely that's a reason For laughing off the present, while laughing hours remain. THE DANCE IS DESERTED, THE REVELLERS GONE. (Florentine Air.) I The dance is deserted, the revellers gone, The gay scene is alter'd, its splendour is flown; Like gardens, whose summer profusion of bloom Too quickly is follow'd by winter and gloom: Oh! where are the eyes that shone brightest to-night? And where are the sweet lips that whisper'd delight? Morn's tell-tale ray Chas'd them away; Eyes that have shone all night, shrink from the day. II And she, who the fairest was seen to advance, All lightness and loveliness, leading the dance, Beholds in her slumbers the youth she prefers, Whose hand gave its tenderest pressure to hers; Again sees those looks which her heart can explain In visions he speaks, and she listens again. Pleasure at last Would vanish too fast, If we could not dream over the bliss of the past. III Above her soft pillow, bright fairies are seen, Who float in the air round the form of their queen; Her light wand is wav'd o'er the slumberer's head, And shades of past pleasures encircle her bed: “Oh! bright,” cries the sprite, “are the visions I bring; “I smile, and reality loses its sting: “If you should miss “Tangible bliss, “You'll know the worth of a minute like this. IV “On the face of the ocean, in sunshine or shade, “The tints imperceptibly brighten, or fade; “Each varying cloud, or each glittering ray, “Makes the face of the ocean more sombre, or gay: “Some hearts change as quickly; the friend of the past, “The dearest, the best, is forgotten at last; “Faith which appears “Hallow'd by tears “Is lost in the sunshine of happier years. V “Yes! this is the world: like the changeable wind, “Thus destiny sports with the hopes of mankind; “And since so uncertain their joys when awake, “We Fairies keep watch in the night for their sake; “All daylight disasters we snatch from their view, “While friends seem all constant, and lovers all true: “And when they weep— “Though wounds are deep, “I with my wand bring a solace in sleep.” O LEAVE ME TO MY SORROW. (Irish Air.) I O leave me to my sorrow, For my heart is oppress'd to-day; O leave me, and to-morrow— Dark shadows may pass away: There's a time when all that grieves us Is felt with a deeper gloom; There's a time when hope deceives us, And we dream of bright days to come, II In winter, from the mountain, The stream like a torrent flows; In summer, the same fountain Is calm as a child's repose: Thus, in grief, the first pangs wound us, And tears of despair gush on; Time brings forth new flowers around us, And the tide of our grief is gone. OH! CUPID'S BOW. (Spanish Air.) I Oh! Cupid's bow Is not to blame For half the woe Which bears his name: Another child Assumes his form; He's just as wild, And just as warm: He copies each Seductive wile, His gentle speech, His winning smile: With subtle flame He tips his darts, Andt akes his aim At female hearts; His wings we view As amply plum'd; His blindness too Is well assum'd: That nymph is wise Who cautious moves; Flirtation's eyes Oft mimick Love's. II When first he glides To woman's feet, Flirtation hides His worst deceit; His eyes are shut, His wings conceal'd, And nothing but His smiles reveal'd: The nymph awhile But half approves, Yet thinks the smile Is really Love's: She feels for one Who never feels, Whose heart is stone, While hearts he steals; And when he wins, Ah! fickle swain, He soon begins The game again; And while she sighs, Her sadness proves, Flirtation's eyes Have mimick'd Love's. COME LET US PASS THE SOCIAL GLASS. (Swiss Air.) I Come, let us pass the social glass; Each shall toast his fancy; First let me name a black-ey'd lass, Here's a health to Nancy! Then fill up the sparkling cup, Care's a pallid spectre; This take for my fair one's sake, And you'll find it nectar. II Now I can boast a merry toast Fairer far than any; Bright blue eyes delight me most: Here's a health to Fanny! Then fill up the sparkling cup, Care's a pallid spectre; This take for my fair one's sake, And you'll find it nectar. III O I can prize no common eyes, Black and blue may vary; I know where expression lies: Here's a health to Mary! Then fill up the sparkling cup, Care's a pallid spectre; This take for my fair one's sake, And you'll find it nectar. “TOUJOURS LE MEME” WAS ENGRAV'D ON THE TOKEN. (French Air.) I “Toujours le même” was engrav'd on the token, The ring Rosa gave to the youth she preferr'd; Sadly she gazed from her casement, heart-broken, And wav'd a farewell,—but she spoke not a word. He sigh'd adieu, and she thought sigh'd sincerely, Whilst fondly he cried, “Oh remember my name; “When far away, I shall love thee as dearly, “As fondly, as faithfully, toujours le même!” II When he was gone, for a time he roved blindly 'Midst beauties, and sigh'd at the liveliest ball; But when fair maids on his sadness look'd kindly, The sad one had smiles to bestow on them all! If on the past the gay youth e'er reflected, New pleasures were sought to drown sorrow and shame, Soon he forgot Rosa's smile, and neglected Her ring—and its motto of toujours le même. III Rosa was sad; for a time she persuaded Her fond heart that chance his return might defer; But when the hopes she had cherish'd, all faded, His coldness, his falsehood, were fatal to her. Ah! is it strange while men wildly are roving, Their thoughts and their vows are not ever the same? Man loves again, and ne'er suffers from loving; But woman, sweet woman, is toujours le même. HARK, THE CONVENT BELLS ARE RINGING. (Portuguese Air.) I Hark! the convent bells are ringing, And the nuns are sweetly singing, “Holy Virgin, hear our prayer;” See the novice comes to sever Ev'ry worldly tie for ever; “Take, Oh take her to your care!” Still radiant gems are shining, Her jet-black locks entwining; And her robes around her flowing With sunny tint glowing, But all her rays are dim; “Splendours brighter “Now invite her, “While we chaunt our vesper hymn.” II Now the lovely maid is kneeling, With uplifted eyes appealing; “Holy Virgin, hear our prayer;” See, the abbess bending o'er her, Breathes the sacred vow before her, “Take, Oh take her to your care!” Her form no more possesses Those dark luxuriant tresses; The solemn words are spoken, Each earthly link is broken, And all earthly joys are dim; “Splendours brighter “Now invite her, “While we chaunt our vesper hymn.” WE MEET AGAIN, BUT NOT IN BLISS. (Scotch Air.) I We meet again, but not in bliss, As we have met in moments past; One sad remembrance darkens this— Too well we know it is the last: You go to fight in foreign lands, Far, far across the raging main; Long years must pass before our hands Can meet in friendship's grasp again. II But though we meet as altered men, In form and strength, less young and gay; Though eyes may beam less brightly then, And joy from some may pass away; Yet promise this before we part, Though there is much which time may chill, We'll meet unchang'd in warmth of heart, And keep our friendship blooming still. III We'll talk of all the merry days, The days so darkly closing thus; We'll sing again our jovial lays, Reviving thoughts most dear to us: Our former jests shall gaily pass, And bring back frolics—far remov'd; Again we'll fill the social glass. To all the Scottish maids we loved. IV Though some sad proofs the world affords, That kindness often masks deceit; Though many part with warmest words, Yet change to coldness when they meet; In me such change you ne'er shall view; Our parting was no studied form; The voice that warmly spoke adieu, Shall speak a welcome just as warm. V But should you all at length return In safety to your native shore, And seek the friend you lov'd, and learn His hand can welcome you no more: Though pleasure's voice, and beauty's smile, Around your happy homes may be; E'en then perhaps you'll pause awhile, And heave one secret sigh for me. THERE CAME FROM THE WARS ON A JET BLACK STEED. (Welsh Air.) I There came from the wars on a jet black steed, A Knight with a snowy plume: He flew o'er the heath like a captive freed From a dungeon's dreary gloom. II And gaily he rode to his lordly home,— But the towers were dark and dim; And he heard no reply, when he called for some Who were dearer than life to him. III The gate which was hurled from its ancient place Lay mould'ring on the bare ground, And the Knight rushed in, but saw not a trace Of a friend, as he gazed around! IV He flew to the grove, where his mistress's lute Had charmed him with love's sweet tone: But 'twas desolate now, and the strings were mute, And she he adored was gone. V The wreaths were all dead in Rosalie's bower, And Rosalie's dove was lost; And the winter's wind had withered each flower On the myrtle she valued most. VI But a cypress grew where the myrtle's bloom Once scented the morning air; And under its shade was a marble tomb, And Rosalie's name was there! FLY FORWARD MY BOAT! BEAR ME OVER THE OCEAN. (Scotch Air.) I Fly forward, my boat! bear me over the ocean, To yonder luxuriant meadows and trees: Compar'd with my wishes, how slow is your motion, How feeble the tide, and how languid the breeze! For on that sunny land there is one who sits viewing Each cloud on the sky and each speck on the sea; Who with love's eager glance ev'ry bark is pursuing: Then onward—for Anna is watching for me! II Like beautiful birds in their fulness of feather. Yon vessels unfurl all their sails to the wind; Oh! would that we all could fly forward together! But no, they leave my little boat far behind: Yet, my light little boat! all those gay barks are chasing Fame, fortune, or friends, far away o'er the sea; They know not the charms of the isle they are passing, They know not that Anna is watching for me. III One moment she wishes the wind would blow stronger, Then thinks there is danger and wishes it less; Now looks on the waves, and then fears to look longer, And prays for my safety in silent distress. Though the breeze freshens now, and will soon waft me over, Though swiftly my boat cuts her way through the sea, Too slowly she moves for the heart of a lover, Too slowly for her who sits watching for me. I'LL WATCH FOR THEE. (German Air.) I I'll watch for thee, From my lonely bower; Come o'er the sea At the twilight hour; Come when the day Passes away, Come when the nightingale sings on the tree! Come, and remove Doubts of thy love; But if thou lov'st me not—come not to me! II Why didst thou say I was brighter far Than the bright ray Of the evening star? Why didst thou come Seeking my home, Till I believ'd that thy love was sincere? Oh! if thy vow Wearies thee now Though I may weep for thee,—never come here! HAIL, SOURCE OF JOY! THY MAGIC TOUCH HATH GIVEN. (Air from Haydn.) I Hail, source of joy! thy magic touch hath given Spirit and eloquence to these mute chords: Sweet Music, hail! thou wakest thoughts of heaven, Linking unearthly sounds to earthly words. Hearts own thy sway! when countless voices raise Through echoing aisles the song of prayer and praise. II The merry dance, the “poetry of motion,” Owes all its charm, its very birth, to thee; Footsteps as light as foam upon the ocean, Robb'd of thy measures, motionless would be. Hearts own thy sway, when youthful beauty moves And seems to float upon the tune she loves! III Thy soothing cadence lulls affliction's slumbers, Thy nobler strains arouse the warrior's fire; And well we know the pathos of thy numbers, When little Cupid strings Apollo's lyre. Hearts own thy sway, when lovers glide along O'er waves whose ripple mingles with their song. SHE NEVER BLAMED HIM—NEVER. (Hindoostanee Air.) I She never blamed him—never,— But received him when he came, With a welcome kind as ever, And she tried to look the same: But vainly she dissembled, For whene'er she tried to smile, A tear unbidden trembled In her blue eye all the while. II She knew that she was dying And she dreaded not her doom; She never thought of sighing O'er her beauty's blighted bloom. She knew her cheek was altered, And she knew her eye was dim; But her sweet voice only faltered, When she spoke of losing him. III 'Tis true that He had lured her From the isle where she was born; 'Tis true He had inured her To the cold world's cruel scorn; But yet she never blamed him For the anguish she had known; And though she seldom named him Yet she thought of Him alone. IV She sighed when he caress'd her, For she knew that they must part; She spoke not when he press'd her To his young and panting heart:— The banners waved around her, And she heard the bugle's sound— They pass'd—and strangers found her Cold and lifeless on the ground. YOU THINK I AM UNFEELING. (Indian Air.) I You think I am unfeeling; But ah! you do not mark the tear That o'er my cheek is stealing, When no gay friends are near: As yet you've met me only Where all their darker thoughts conceal; But come when I am lonely, And own that I can feel. I scorn the ties which link me To those who sport on folly's stream; They know me not who think me The trifler that I seem. II The flaming toy, that flashes Like some pure planet of the skies, Soon falls in shapeless ashes, And of its splendour dies! As heartless, and as hollow, Is all the radiance we assume; And oh! as surely follow The coldness and the gloom. Then all the clust'ring roses We heaped together fade away; And lonely night discloses The thoughts we shun'd by day. WHEN THE EYE OF BEAUTY CLOSES. (Venetian Air.) I When the eye of Beauty closes, When the weary are at rest; When the infant's form reposes, Lulled upon its mother's breast: When the moonlight tips the billow, With a wreath of silver foam; Then I leave my sleepless pillow, Then I think of thee and home. II Sleep may visit those who languish Fading on a fevered bed; Sleep may soothe the mourner's anguish When a dream restores the dead: But when Earth itself seems sleeping, And the breathless summer sky; Then my lonely vigils keeping, Then I think of days gone by. I HAVE SENT BACK EV'RY TOKEN. (Italian Air.) I I have sent back ev'ry token, Which you gave me long ago; When those fond vows first were spoken, Which are cancelled now I know: I resign them, but to-morrow Oh! how lonely shall I be! They have soothed me in my sorrow; They reminded me of Thee. II Take thy dear harp, 'twill forsake me As all other joys depart: But alas! thou canst not make me Chace its music from my heart: Tho' I lose it, and these numbers Which I waken, are the last; Fancy oft will bless my slumbers With the sweet notes of the past. IN HALLS OF PRIDE. (Greek Air.) I In halls of pride fair Helen lived, She was a chieftain's daughter; Who with a friendly hand received, The gallant Knights who sought her: Each dawning day new conquests brought, Each night fond vows were spoken; To gain her favour champions fought; And spears (and hearts) were broken. II But Helen heard their vows unmoved) And wished their folly over; She laughed at love—or if she loved, It was some secret lover. And every night alone she went, Regardless of her pillow, And stood upon the battlement, And gazed upon the billow. III Why went she there, and who was He Whose boat lay on the water? What came he for? it could not be To woo the Chieftain's daughter! Oh! no! she surely went to watch The stars with fond devotion; And he, as surely came to catch The fishes in the ocean. IV It may be so—yet strange to say, The Knights were disconcerted, When seeking her at dawn one day, The chamber was deserted! (Of course a good girl ne'er elopes;) Yet Helen has bereft them Of sanguine hopes, And a ladder of ropes Is all that she has left them! GO! MAY'ST THOU BE HAPPY. (Bavarian Air.) I Go! may'st thou be happy, Though sadly we part; In life's early summer Grief breaks not the heart; The ills that assail us As speedily pass As shades o'er a mirror, Which stain not the glass. II Reject not my token, Though soon thou wilt be Far over the billows, Forgetful of me; To me, and me only, 'Tis anguish to part. For thou wilt meet kindness Wherever thou art. III And oh! when beholding A different scene, When leaves fall around you That used to be green; May winter be clothed in His loveliest form, With all of his grandeur, But none of his storm, THERE'S MUSIC AND MIRTH ON THE OCEAN. (Spanish Air.) I There's music and mirth on the ocean; Each gaily trimm'd bark is in motion; But mine in the race shall be fleetest, The burthen it bears is the sweetest; Then fear not, for every billow Is safe as an infant's soft pillow: Come! come! the Regatta is gay, Love, The Rosa shall triumph to-day, Love. II No cloud on the sky shall alarm thee, No wave on the water shall harm thee; The course of my bark shall be ever As smooth as the flow of a river; The soft air of summer shall move us, And fan the gay banner above us! Come! come! the Regatta is gay, Love The Rosa shall triumph to-day, Love. III If other proud vessels should chace us, They'd find it not easy to pass us; The helmsman forgetting his duty, Will pause, when he looks on thy beauty; The charm of thy voice shall mislead him, The spell of thy smile shall impede him; Come! come! the Regatta is gay, Love, The Rosa shall triumph to-day, Love. WEEP NOT AROUND ME. (German Air.) I Weep not around me, my sorrows are over, Gay as a bridal my triumph shall be; See they are raising a pile for my Lover! See they are spreading a pillow for me! Look on my Hero in darkness reposing. Sad are his slumbers of Ada bereft; Oh! when the bright flames are over us closing, Think not I'll sigh for the world I have left. II They may be pitied, whose season of mourning Lingers around them still hopelessly dim; I shall exult, when yon beacon light burning, Circles my Amir, and shrouds me with him. Love in the west, they say, speedily changes, Losing its lustre like yon setting star; Love that is pledged on the banks of the Ganges, Boasts a charm'd spell, like my precious Zinar. III Sing me your loud songs of triumph, and tell me No more of weak fear, for I know not the word: Shout round my couch, for should torture compel me To utter one groan, it must never be heard. Soon shall this body be mouldering ashes, But my free soul shall be wafted above; When o'er the valley the fading light flashes Ada shall rest on the bosom of Love. I'LL SING TO THEE THE FONDEST LAYS. (Scotch Air.) I I'll sing to thee the fondest lays That blue-eyed maiden ever heard; I'll glean from songs of other days Each tender thought, each gentle word: I will not let my fancy rove To themes that charm the worldly throng: Oh! no! for fairy dreams of love And nought but love shall grace my song. II I'll twine for thee the fairest flowers That bloom upon the moss-rose tree; I'll climb the hills, I'll search the bowers, To find a garland fit for thee; I'll breathe to thee each fervent vow That ever pledged a lover's truth, And swear the tie that links us now Shall long outlive the smiles of youth. III I'll build for thee the lightest bark That ever sailed upon the sea; And when the troubled waves are dark, My faithful arms shall shelter thee: To glory's track,—or fortune's smile, Let other vessels proudly float, To some secluded sunny isle I'll gaily steer my precious boat. HARK! HARK! I HEAR A DISTANT DRUM. (Troubadour Air.) I Hark! hark! I hear a distant drum;— The tramp of the steeds,—they come! they come! With weapons bright and banners gay, They pass along in proud array; We view the pomp of war alone, Its gloom is gone: And sweet to-night their dreams will be Of Love, and Joy, and Victory. II But yon fair girl, in mute despair, Looks round for one—who is not there; She watches them till all are past, And scarce believes she sees the last. She lingers still—yet all are gone— She stands alone! Her Edward comes not,—where is he? Alas! can this be Victory? OH! NO! WE NEVER MENTION HER. (French Air.) I Oh! no! we never mention her, Her name is never heard; My lips are now forbid to speak That once familiar word: From sport to sport they hurry me To banish my regret; And when they win a smile from me, They think that I forget. II They bid me seek in change of scene The charms that others see; But were I in a foreign land, They'd find no change in me: 'Tis true that I behold no more The valley where we met; I do not see the hawthorn tree— But how can I forget? III For oh! there are so many things Recall the past to me;— The breeze upon the sunny hills, The billows of the sea; The rosy tint that decks the sky Before the sun is set;— Ay, every leaf I look upon Forbids me to forget. IV They tell me she is happy now, The gayest of the gay; They hint that she forgets me, But heed not what they say: Like me perhaps she struggles with Each feeling of regret; But if she loves as I have loved, She never can forget. I'M SADDEST WHEN I SING. I You think I have a merry heart, Because my songs are gay, But oh! they all were taught to me By Friends now far away: The Bird retains his silver note, Though bondage chains his wing; His song is not a happy one— I'm saddest when I sing! II I heard them first in that sweet home I never more shall see, And now each song of joy, has got A plaintive turn for me! Alas 'tis vain in winter time To mock the songs of spring, Each note recalls some withered leaf— I'm saddest when I sing! III Of all the Friends I used to love My harp remains alone, Its faithful voice still seems to be An echo of my own: My tears when I bend over it Will fall upon its string, Yet those who hear me, little think I'm saddest when I sing! LOVE ADIEU! I Once when you tried to vex and grieve me, Pride for a wonder gave me aid, And when you said “I wish you'd leave me,” I to your great surprise—obey'd! Then to the dim abodes of Learning In a fine frenzy, off I flew, And I exclaimed while sagely turning Classical pages—“Love adieu!” II Music I thought my Grief might soften, But the same songs were still my choice, Which I had heard you sing so often— And they were vile without your voice. Painting I tried,—my sketch for ever Ended in something too like you; Charmed with my own work, oh! I never Could say distinctly “Love adieu.” III Then on the stars intently staring, I with my glass explored the skies; But in my mind I was comparing Those orbs of light, with your bright eyes: So I forsook the shades of Science, And to my fair Enchantress flew, 'Tis ever thus with Man's defiance, When he dare utter “Love adieu.” GOD OF THE FATHERLESS. I When the sun gloriously comes forth from the ocean, Making earth beautiful, chasing shadows away; Thus do we offer Thee our prayer of devotion,— God of the Fatherless!—guide us—guard us to-day! II When o'er the western hills the sunset tints blending, Show us how quickly fades all that on earth seems bright, Then to unfading realms our prayer is ascending,— God of the Fatherless!—guide us—guard us to-night! FLY AWAY, POOR CAPTIVE BIRD. I Fly away! Poor captive bird Too long I've heard Thy notes of woe, I'll let thee go, 'Tis hard to sing With fetter'd wing Then fly away! II Fly away! I've known the gloom Of such a doom; I've seen the stars Through prison bars, And prayed to be At liberty! Then fly away! III Fly away! 'Tis sad to dwell In such a cell; To heave a sigh For yon blue sky, For hills, and groves, And early loves; Then fly away. BEHOLD THE SHIPS. I Behold the ships that proudly leave The shelter of the shore; The port of safety and of peace, They ne'er may enter more: And yet they go exultingly With sails and flags unfurl'd; And rush to brave the elements, Like youth to brave the world! II Alas how like! some few are made To sport on summer seas, The buffets that they meet, are but A billow and a breeze: But some sail under darker skies In tempest and in strife; Like mortals who must struggle through The darker scenes of life! I'LL FIND YOU OUT. I We meet to-night, I do not ask What gay costume you mean to wear, Your eyes will peep through veil and mask, And tell who lurks in ambush there. Ay, close your eyes, and stain your cheek, Do what you will to make me doubt— You must be dumb, for should you speak One little word, I'll find you out! II If as a Savoyard you trip, Your pretty foot my clue will be. In Gypsy rags, your fingers' tip Will point my own love out to me: Beneath a Nun's monastic veil I know your ruby lip will pout; Disguise with you is sure to fail, Wear what you will, I'll find you out! WHERE IS HE NOW! I Where is He now? His boat lies on the shore, Torn is her sail, her banner flies no more; Oft on that deck we've seen his manly form, Spurning the wave, exulting in the storm! Where is He now? II Where is He now? His war-steed roams the plain, Loose o'er his neck is thrown the useless rein; Mute is the tongue that urged that courser's flight, Cold is the heart once fearless in the fight! Where is He now? III Where is He now? His sword is in its sheath, See where it lies beside his laurel wreath; Helmet and plume hang idle on the wall! Hush'd is his harp, and desolate his hall! Where is He now? I WILL LOVE YOU. I I will love you! that is saying I'll be all you most approve, Ev'ry deed of mine, obeying Ev'ry wish of Him I love; Speak not, for your eyes will guide me, And the payment that I seek, Is that you will sit beside me With a smile upon your cheek. II I will love you! round you sporting When I know your heart's at ease, Proudly for your sake exerting Ev'ry talent that can please: And as surely will I watch you In the moment of alarm, Oh! how happy could I snatch you From a woe, with this weak arm. THE DESERTED BRIDE. I Am I then so soon deserted, Is my boasted beauty gone? Was I sought, and was I courted For my gold alone? Poorer maids my grief behold! Love will not be bought with gold. II In my home the lover found me, Then these eyes had ne'er been dim Many friends were smiling round me, Yet I welcomed Him! Oh! how could you change such bliss, False one! to a doom like this? III Yet I loved you, and I swerve not From the love I once profess; Though such duty you deserve not, I'll not love you less: No, I came with my free will, And alas! I love you still! IV Take my gold,—ah, could I weave it Into Love's own precious chain; Trust me I would freely give it Were it mine again. Faithful Love forgets its pride, Come to your deserted Bride. THE LADY'S PAGE. I I'll hang up my harp on a willow tree, And I'll go to the wars again; For a peaceful home has no charm for me, And a battle-field no pain; The Lady I serve will soon be a bride, With a diadem on her brow; Ah! why did she flatter my boyish pride? She is going to leave me now. II She took me away from a warlike Lord, And she gave me a silken suit; And I thought no more of my Master's sword, When I danced to my Lady's lute; And she seemed to think me a Boy above Her pages of low degree: Oh had I but loved with a boyish love, It would have been well for me. III In my breast I will hide my selfish care, I will flush my pale cheek with wine; And when smiles shall welcome the Bridal pair, I will hasten to give them mine. I will laugh and sing, though my heart may bleed, I will dance to the Bridal train; And if I survive it, I'll mount my steed, And I'll rush to the wars again. O SMILE NOT UPON ME. I Oh smile not upon me, a frown were less cold Than a smile so unlike those you gave me of old; Thy love was my treasure, I mourn its decay— Sighing!—Sighing!—day after day. II You speak to me kindly, and strive to conceal By the warmth of your words, all the languor you feel; But I see that in thought you are roving away— Sighing!—Sighing!—day after day. III Go smile upon others and leave me to die, I shall rest in the tomb where my forefathers lie; Where once I was happy, 'tis torture to stray— Sighing!—Sighing!—day after day. IV I sit by the river and watch the cascade, Ah!—once there was mirth in the murmur it made; But sorrowful now seems the dash of its spray— Sighing!—Sighing!—day after day. A SOLDIER LAD. I A Soldier Lad my Love shall be, He'll frown on the foe, but He'll smile on me. I'll deck his helm with plumage light. I'll make his shield and buckler bright; And when the trump he hears, He shall not see my tears. II A Soldier Lad my Love shall be, He'll frown on the foe, but He'll smile on me, And when I hear the fife and drum, When all exclaim “They come! They come!” I know I shall not speak,— The voice of joy is weak! III A Soldier Lad my Love shall be, He'll frown on the foe, but He'll smile on me, I'll make him tell of battles fought, Yet shudder at the tale I sought; His hand will press my own, To prove the danger gone. MINIATURE LYRICS. IN THIS FRIGID PLANET. (French Air.) I In this frigid planet Dim Love's torch appears Though fond hope will fan it, Soon 'tis quenched in tears. Would there were a star, Where we could live together, Far from earth—too far For jealous eyes to peep; Where Love, true as mine, Unkindness ne'er should wither; Where eyes, bright as thine, Never more should weep. II View that star, just risen O'er the tranquil sea; If it were our prison, Oh! how blest we'd be! From that radiant home I'd ne'er wish to wander; Sorrow ne'er should come To molest us there. Though unfeeling men Tear fond hearts asunder; We would triumph then O'er each earthly snare. III Some, with cold derision, Lover's dreams condemn; But my star-light vision Ne'er was meant for them: They who weep for one, Loved in brighter hours; They who sadly shun Mirth—and song—and dance; They, like me, will feel When Life has lost its flowers; 'Tis no harm to steal OPEN YOUR CASEMENT, MY DEAR. A BALLAD, (An original Air.—Composed by Master Balfe.) I Come open your casement, my dear, And fearlessly gaze on the sea; 'Tis tranquil, and why should you fear To venture upon it with me? See light clouds are veiling the moon, No eye your departure will note; Come down from your chamber, and soon I'll waft you away in my boat. II Thus sung a fond youth to his love, Who was sleeping—(Love never should sleep,) Her father was peeping above, (Oh! fathers you never should peep:)— To his daughter's balcony he brought Her monkey in muslins array'd; The youth was o'erjoy'd, for he thought 'Twas the form of his beautiful maid. III He gaz'd on the figure in white, Whose nods gave new life to his hopes, His heart throbb'd with love and delight As he threw up the ladder of ropes; His charmer hopp'd down it—and then The happy delusion was o'er.— Girls often meet monkey-like men, But man ne'er wooed monkey before. IV From the window enjoying the joke, Her Father feared danger no more, And she by the bustle awoke, Soon made her escape at the door: “Come, come to your Rosa,” she said, “Unless you prefer my baboon; “And pray let your next serenade “Take place at the full of the moon.” MARY, THINK OF ME. (An original Air.—Composed by Mr. Lee.) I When rays of summer beam o'er your bower, When the fresh blossoms are upon the tree, And when you walk at this lone hour, Under the willows,—Mary, think of me. With other youths, gaily you'll wander, Yet when they breathe vows of love to thee, You'll sigh for one whose love was fonder, Yes, Mary, yes, then you'll think of me. II These faded blossoms once bloomed above me, Often I met thee under their sweet shade, When they were fresh you seem'd to love me, I never thought love, like them, would fade. But winter's gloom soon will be over, These wither'd trees bright and green will be, Then, Mary, then mourn for your lover, Over my tomb, dear Mary, weep for me. I'LL BE TRUE TO THEE. (Swiss Air.—Arranged by Sir J. Stevenson.) I They tell thee to doubt me, And think of me no more; They say I have sported With female hearts before: But when you hear unkind ones speak, With venomed tongue, and smiling cheek, Repel them, And tell them I have been true to Thee. II They tell thee, the brightness Of frost upon the tree, Which melts in the sunshine, Is true—compared with me: But like two leaves, that on the stem Remain, till winter withers them, United, 'Till blighted, Thus—I'll be true to Thee. OH! HEAR MY SWEET GUITAR. (Spanish Seguidillo.—Arranged by Mr. Horn.) I Oh! hear my sweet guitar;— 'Tis like that bird We oft have heard, Who all night long Sings one fond song;— Thus, Isabel, you are My constant theme: Then do not waste the bliss Of such a night as this, For clouds too soon Will veil the moon, Then calmly dream, My Isabel. II My Isabel, that bird Sings not alone; His sweetest tone Is echoed now, From yonder bough: Yes, there a song is heard Which answers him: But sad my song must be, For 'till you answer me. Though stars are bright, To me their light Seems cold and dim, My Isabel. THE LITTLE PET PLANT. (An original Air.—Composed by Mr. Smith.) I A Florist a sweet little blossom espied, Which bloom'd like its ancestors by the road side; Its sweetness was simple, its colours were few, Yet the blossom looked fair in the spot where it grew; The Florist beheld it, and cried, “I'll enchant “The botanical world with this sweet little plant; “Its leaves shall be shelter'd, and carefully nursed, “It shall charm all the world, tho' I met with it first “Under a hedge!” II He carried it home to his hot-house with care, And he said, “Tho' the rarest exotics are there, “My little pet plant, when I've nourished its stem, “In tint and in fragrance shall imitate them. “Tho' none shall suspect from the road side it came, “Roadum Sidum I'll call it, a beautiful name! “While Botanists look thro' their glasses and view “Its beauties, they'll never suspect that it grew “Under a hedge!” III The little Pet Plant, when it shook off the dirt Of its own native ditch, soon began to be pert, And toss'd its small head, for perceiving that none But Exotics were round it, it thought itself one. As a wild flower, all would have owned it was fair And prais'd it tho' gaudier blossoms were there; But when it assumes hot-house airs we see through The forc'd tint of its leaves, and suspect that it grew “Under a hedge!” MORAL. In the bye ways of life, oh! how many there are, Who, being born under some fortunate star, Assisted by beauty or talent grow rich And bloom in a hot-house instead of a ditch. And whilst they disdain not their own simple stem, The honours they grasp, may gain honour from them; But when (like the Pet Plant) such people grow pert, We soon trace them to their original dirt “Under a hedge!” THE QUEEN OF THE MAY. (Scotch Air.—Arranged by Mr. Barton.) I Can that be the maiden, the Queen of the May, I left in the village most fair and most gay; Whose lovers surrounded her cowslip twin'd throne, She laughed with them all but smil'd fondly on one. That eye now so heavy, how bright was its glance, That lingering footstep was first in the dance, That brow so dejected made others rejoice, And blithe was her accent and sweet was her voice. II And why is the maiden so chang'd since we met? She lov'd him, she lost him, she cannot forget. Can sad hearts dissemble the joy that is gone? Can death's muffled bell echo life's silver tone? The youth was permitted to follow her form, To guide her in sunshine, and guard her in storm; And daily she met him, and ne'er was reprov'd, 'Till her father's reproof came too late, for they lov'd. III The joy of his daughter a father may chill— Affection once kindled obeys not his will; The torrent once suffered to deluge the plain, We cannot recal to its channel again: Go, cold-hearted being, exult in your sway, From hearts you have link'd, tear each fond tie away; Exult 'till you view the dark dwelling of death,— Then mourn o'er the victim who slumbers beneath. REMEMBER ME. I Remember me when I am gone, I still would claim the thoughts of one, And Anna thou wilt ever be, The one I wish to think of me. When winds are fair, and sails are set, I only ask one heart's regret; And oh, how blest should I discern, One welcome smile when I return. II I only ask where'er I rove, A few dear friends, and one dear love; My muse has fame enough if one, For my sake listens to its tone. In fields of war one potent charm, Shall warm my heart, and nerve my arm; In conquest I shall only need, One cheering voice to praise the deed. III Enjoyment loses half its worth, Till one is near to share my mirth; And sorrow's pang is less severe, If one consoling form is near, Remember me when I am gone, I still would claim the thoughts of one. And, Anna, thou wilt ever be The one I wish to think of me. REMEMBER THEE. Addressed to Miss Stephens on hearing her sing “Remember Me.” I Remember thee! can those who hear That lovely voice forget its tone? Remember thee! ah! can'st thou fear Neglect from us, when thou art gone! Must those who hear those notes be told To think of thee with fond regret. It seems as if you deemed us cold— As if you thought we could forget! II In lonely hours, how oft a thought Wakes half forgotten joys again; And blissful feelings come unsought, Though long we lured them back in vain. Thus oft when thou art far away, A voice less sweet—or some wild string Will breathe of thee, and we shall say “Oh! 'tis the song she used to sing.” III Farewell, farewell, if doomed to rove, May'st thou behold unclouded skies; Be still the joy of all who love A thrilling voice, and laughing eyes. May'st thou still meet with friends as warm To tell thee how adored thou art; Yet seem unconscious of the charm Which makes thee rule in every heart. WHY DO WE LOVE? I often think each tottering form That limps along in life's decline; Once bore a heart as young—as warm As full of idle thoughts, as mine. And each has had his dream of joy, His own unequall'd, pure romance; Commencing when the blushing boy First thrills at lovely woman's glance. And each could tell his tale of youth, And think its scenes of love evince More passion, more unearthly truth Than any tale before, or since. Yes! they could tell of tender lays At midnight penn'd in classic shades; Of days—more bright than modern days, And maids more fair than living maids. Of whispers in a willing ear; Of kisses on a blushing cheek; Each kiss—each whisper, far too dear For modern lips to give or speak. Of prospects too untimely cross'd, Of passion slighted, or betray'd; Of kindred spirits early lost, And buds that blossomed but to fade. Of beaming eyes, and tresses gay— Elastic form, and noble brow; And charms that all have passed away, And left them—what we see them now! And is it so? Is human love So very light, so frail a thing! And must youth's brightest visions move For ever on Time's restless wing! Must all the eyes that still are bright, And all the lips that talk of bliss, And all the forms so fair to-night, Hereafter—only come to this? Ah yes! each path where lovers rove, In shady groves, or on the shore; If it can echo vows of love, Hath echoed vows as fond before. And other forms, as fair as these, Have glided down yon verdant glen; And other nymphs beneath the trees Have heard the flattering words of men. A strain as sweet as that which floats Upon the breeze, o'er yonder wave, By moonlight rose from other boats— From lips—now silent as the grave. Then what are love's best visions worth, If we, at length, must yield them thus? If all we value most on earth, Ere long, must fade away from us! If that one being, whom we take From all the world, and still recur To all she said, and for her sake Feel far from joy, when far from her; If that one form which we adore, From youth to age—in bliss or pain, Soon withers, and is seen no more; Why do we love, if love be vain? Oh! is it not because we love (Far more than beauty's fleeting worth;) The kindred soul which soars above The fair, yet fading flow'rs of earth? Because affection shuddering shrinks From the cold dust left mouldering here, And midst his tears the mourner thinks Of joy beyond this troubled sphere? Yes—if when beauty's dazzling mask Is gone, no other charms remain; Well may the heart desponding ask— “Why do we love, if love be vain?” But 'tis not so.—When we behold Death's faded victim once so fair, The eye is dim—The lip is cold— But all we valued—lies not there! TRUTH AND YOUNG ROMANCE. (Air composed by Mr. Sinclair.) I Young Romance through roses straying Saw old Truth trudge lamely on; One in pleasure's light was playing, The other sigh'd for pleasures gone. Cries Romance, “Oh, rest a minute, And discuss our views of earth:— Yours may have most prudence in it, But in mine is all the mirth!” II “Ah!” says Truth, “this world discloses Nought but vain delusive wiles. Thorns are under all your roses, Sadness follows all your smiles.” Cries Romance, “Perhaps I often Colour life with tints too warm; Yet my warmth a shade may soften, While your coldness chills a charm.” III “What is love?” the sage then asks him— “Love—in summer hours so sweet? Wint'ry weather soon unmasks him, And your idol proves a cheat!” “Love!” the youth replies, “Oh, sever Real love from vain deceits: Constant love brings hours that never Lose their sunshine, or their sweets.” IV “Friendship, too, you call a treasure, But,” says Truth, “it is a tie Loosely worn 'mid scenes of pleasure, And when fortune frowns—thrown by.” “Friendship,” he replies, “possesses Worth which no dark change destroys; Seeking, soothing our distresses, Sharing, doubling all our joys.” V “Go,” says Truth, “'tis plain we never Can such hostile thoughts combine; Folly is your guide for ever, While dull sense must still be mine.” Cries the Boy—“Frown on, no matter, Mortals love my merry glance! E'en in Truth's own path they scatter Roses snatch'd from young Romance.” TOO MANY LOVES. (Air composed by Mr. Horn.) I When a heart is contented with one little Love, No follies, no pleasures, can tempt him to rove; In storm, and in sunshine, that one Love will live, Outweighing all else that the wide world can give. But when one little heart flirts with too many loves, Each Cupid a wild little wanderer proves; His smile has no charm, his resentment no sting, And his faith is more light than a Butterfly's wing. II When too many loves sport in Beauty's fair bowers, They scatter the blossoms of too many flowers; They revel 'mid roses all day—but they leave No fragrance—no bloom to refresh them at eve: But when beauty admits only one little guest, He flies to one rose, never heeding the rest; That one rose may wither—yet sweet to the last, 'Twill serve for his pillow when summer is past. III The frail bark of Folly may dance on the tide, Adorn'd with the gay wreaths of pleasure and pride: The first gloomy cloud drives her crew from the deck; The helm is deserted—the vessel a wreck. Yet I've seen a light boat which no storm could o'erwhelm; There was one love on board who stood firm at the helm; He smilingly guided her safe to the shore, And Truth was inscribed on the banner she bore. REPEAT AGAIN. (Duet composed by Sir John Stevenson.) I Repeat again—repeat that song, For feelings that have slumber'd long Revive again; The thoughtless smiles of thoughtless years Dispel awhile the sighs, and tears Of present pain: Oh, what a host of pleaures gone Come to our thoughts with each soft tone! Departed friends seem smiling near, As gay as when we used to hear That merry strain! “Such thoughts are as light as the foam of the sea, Or bubbles that shine for a minute; Though bubbles on water insipid may be, Each wine bubble has spirit in it!” II Yes—'tis the song: but where, oh! where Are those we loved—the young, the fair, With hearts so light? We view them, when from former years Time's veil of shadows disappears, And all is bright! Yes, 'mid the gloom which fortune brings, Some trifle thus gives memory wings; A tune will waft us far away To some departed happy day, Or happy night! “Such thoughts are as light as the foam of the sea, Or bubbles that shine for a minute; Though bubbles on water insipid may be, Each wine bubble has spirit in it!” WON'T YOU. (Air composed by Mr. Ditchfield.) I Do you remember when you heard My lips breathe love's first faltering word; You do, Sweet—don't you? When having wander'd all the day, Link'd arm in arm, I dared to say, “You'll love me—won't you?” II And when you blush'd, and could not speak, I fondly kiss'd your glowing cheek; Did that affront you? Oh, surely not: your eye exprest No wrath—but said, perhaps in jest, “You'll love me—won't you?” III I'm sure my eyes replied, “I will;” And you believe that promise still; You do, Sweet—don't you? Yes, yes! when age has made our eyes Unfit for questions, or replies, You'll love me—won't you? MAY THY LOT IN LIFE BE HAPPY. (Air arranged by Mr. Horn.) I May thy lot in life be happy, undisturbed by thoughts of me, The God who shelters innocence, thy guard and guide will be; Thy heart will lose the chilling sense of hopeless love at last, And the sunshine of the future chase the shadows of the past. II I never wish to meet thee more, though I am still thy friend; I never wish to meet thee more, since dearer ties must end; With worldly smiles and worldly words, I could not pass thee by, Nor turn from thee unfeelingly with cold averted eye. III I could not bear to see thee 'midst the thoughtless and the gay; I could not bear to view thee deck'd in fashion's bright array; And less could I endure to meet thee pensive and alone, When through the trees the ev'ning breeze breathes forth its cheerless moan. IV For I have met thee 'midst the gay—and thought of none but thee; And I have seen the bright array—when it was worn for me; And often near the sunny waves I've wandered by thy side, With joy—that pass'd away as fast as sunshine from the tide. V But cheerless is the summer! there is nothing happy now; The daisy withers on the lawn, the blossom on the bough: The boundless sea looks chillingly, like winter's waste of snow, And it hath lost the soothing sound with which it used to flow. VI I never wish to meet thee more—yet think not I've been taught, By smiling foes, to injure thee by one unworthy thought. No:—blest with some beloved one, from care and sorrow free, May thy lot in life be happy, undisturbed by thoughts of me. TELL ME NO MORE. (Air composed by Mr. Braham.) I Tell me no more that hearts less warm, Feel not the sorrows felt by me; Passing unmov'd by sun and storm Over a tranquil sea: Mine be the heart which feeling sways; Tho' like the ocean's varied form; Tranquil and bright in sunny days, Ruffled in hours of storm. II Dark as a stream whose waters run Under the earth in hidden caves, Where the warm rays of summer's sun Never illumed the waves: Such is the calm of those who rove, Link'd to no being truly dear, While not a cheering ray of love Brightens their cold career. OH SAY NOT 'TWERE A KEENER BLOW. (Air composed by Sir. H. Bishop.) I Oh say not 'twere a keener blow To lose a child of riper years; You do not feel a father's woe, You cannot check a father's tears. The girl who rears a sickly plant, Or cherishes a wounded dove, Will love them most, while most they want The watchfulness of love. II Time must have chang'd that fair young brow, And might have chang'd that spotless heart; Years might have taught deceit—but now, In love's confiding dawn—we part! Ere pain or grief had sown decay, My babe is cradled in the tomb: Like some fair blossom, torn away In all its purest bloom. III With thoughts of peril and of storm We see a bark first touch the wave, But distant seems the whirlwind's form, As distant—as an infant's grave: Though all is calm, the beauteous ship Must brave the whirlwind's rudest breath; Though all is calm, the infant's lip Must meet the kiss of death. THE LAST GREEN LEAF. (Irish Air, “The Jug of Punch,” arranged by Mr. Horn.) I The last green leaf hangs lonely now, Its summer friends have left the bough; Yet, though they withered one by one, The last—still flutters in the sun! And so it is with us to-day, The bowl is filled, we must be gay; We sing old songs again, and yet We've lost old friends since last we met! II But could some lost one now return, And view us here, he would discern Some lips that press the goblet's brim, To hide the sigh that's breath'd for him. We do not meet to banish thought: Yet, though regrets will come unsought, We will not waste in sighs of grief, Life's ling'ring joy—the last green leaf. THE DAUGHTER OF MEATH. (A Tale founded on an Irish Tradition, to be found in Hollinshed's Chronicles.) Turgesius, the chief of a turbulent band, Came over from Norway and conquer'd the land: Rebellion had smooth'd the invader's career, The natives shrank from him, in hate, or in fear; While Erin's proud spirit seem'd slumb'ring in peace, In secret it panted for death—or release. The tumult of battle was hush'd for awhile,— Turgesius was monarch of Erin's fair isle; The sword of the conquerer slept in its sheath, His triumphs were honour'd with trophy and wreath; The princes of Erin despair'd of relief, And knelt to the lawless Norwegian chief. His heart knew the charm of a woman's sweet smile, But ne'er, till he came to this beautiful isle, Did he know with what mild, yet resistless controul, That sweet smile can conquer a conquerer's soul: And oh! 'mid the sweet smiles most sure to enthral, He soon met with one—he thought sweetest of all. The brave Prince of Meath had a daughter as fair As the pearls of Loch Negah, which encircled her hair; The Tyrant beheld her, and cried, “She shall come To reign as the Queen of my gay mountain home; Ere sunset to-morrow hath crimson'd the sea, Melachlin, send forth thy young daughter to me!” Awhile paused the Prince—too indignant to speak, There burn'd a reply in his glance—on his cheek: But quickly that hurried expression was gone, And calm was his manner, and mild was his tone. He answered—“Ere sunset hath crimson'd the sea, To-morrow—I'll send my young daughter to thee!” “At sunset to-morrow your palace forsake, With twenty young chiefs seek the isle on yon lake; And there in its coolest and pleasantest shades, My child shall await you with twenty fair maids: Yes—bright as my armour the damsels shall be, I send with my daughter, Turgesius, to thee.” Turgesius return'd to his palace;—to him The sports of that evening seem'd languid and dim; And tediously long was the darkness of night, And slowly the morning unfolded its light; The sun seem'd to linger—as if it would be An age ere his setting would crimson the sea. At length came the moment—the King and his band With rapture push'd their light boat from the land; And bright shone the gems on their armour, and bright Flash'd their fast-moving oars in the setting sun's light; And long ere they landed, they saw through the trees, The maidens' white garments that waved in the breeze. More strong in the lake was the dash of each oar, More swift the gay vessel flew on to the shore; Its keel touch'd the pebbles—but over the surf The youths in a moment had leap'd to the turf, And rushed to a shady retreat in the wood, Where many veil'd forms mute and motionless stood. “Say, which is Melachlin's fair daughter? away With these veils,” cried Turgesius, “no longer delay; Resistance is vain, we will quickly behold Which robe hides the loveliest face in its fold; These clouds shall no longer o'ershadow our bliss, Let each seize a veil—and my trophy be this!” He seized a white veil, and before him appear'd No fearful weak girl—but a foe to be fear'd! A youth—who sprang forth from his female disguise, Like lightning that flashes from calm summer skies: His hand grasp'd a weapon, and wild was the joy That shone in the glance of the Warrior Boy. And under each white robe a youth was conceal'd, Who met his opponent with sword and with shield. Turgesius was slain—and the maidens were blest, Melachlin's fair daughter more blithe than the rest; And ere the last sunbeam had crimson'd the sea, They hailed the Boy-Victors—and Erin was free! THE LITTLE BARK. (Song composed by Mr. Manners.) I Calm was the night, the moon shone bright. They floated o'er a sea of light— A fair maid leant against the mast And gazed upon our lonely isle; We waved a token as she passed, And she returned it with a smile. No sound was heard—they seemed to glide, In gentle slumber o'er the tide! II That happy night was calm and bright, But storms arose with morning's light;— And all the demons of the deep Rushed from the caverns where they lay, Like tigers that have feigned to sleep, While watching their unconscious prey! The waves were rough, the skies were dark: Alas! how fared the little bark? III The storm is o'er—the sea once more Sports with the pebbles on the shore: Oh! has the bark escaped the storm? Mis-shapen fragments strew the strand; And see a lovely female form, Lies cold and pale upon the sand:— 'Tis she who with a fearless smile, Last night sail'd past our lonely isle! POOR ANNETTE. (French Air, arranged by Mr. Willis.) I I am a little Savoyard, The wind is cold, the sun is set, And night will soon my steps retard, Then raise the latch for poor Annette! My home is far beyond the sea— None know me here, then pity me! Since morn no friendly form has met Poor—lost Annette! II I'll sing to thee—but cannot now With other girls gay songs repeat;— My theme must be a broken vow,— And woman's love—and man's deceit! And ah! my saddest tale will be My own sad fate—them pity me: When I am gone, none will regret Poor—lost Annette! GIVE THAT WREATH TO ME. (Welsh Air, arranged, as a Song or Glee, by Sir John Stevenson.) I Give that wreath to me, When the roses die; Never let it be Thrown neglected by: Bloom and scent may perish, Yet those leaves I'll cherish Hallow'd by thy touch! Then give that wreath to me. II Should I ever find Other Nymphs as fair; With gay wreaths entwin'd Round their flowing hair; Midst the wreaths of pleasure, Still my faded treasure Shall be next my heart! Then give that wreath to me. ART THOU THEN FORSAKEN. (Altered from a Chant by Mr. Manners.) I Art thou then forsaken, Do thy fond hopes fall from thee;— Like sweet blossoms shaken By the tempest from the tree? Does a frown repel thee From the eyes that smil'd before, Does the false one tell thee Thou art dear to him no more? II Though the change may wound thee, Shew it not in look or tone;— Smile—when smiles surround thee, Tears may flow when thou'rt alone! Oh! like yon sweet flowers, Meet the sunshine of the world— Though in darker hours, Ev'ry dewy leaf is furled. THE BANNER SHOULD WAVE. (Glee composed by Mr. Clifton.) I The banner should wave o'er the tomb of the brave, And his comrades should follow his corse to the grave! He should fall in the field—he should rest on his shield, And should smile on the wound he knows ne'er can be heal'd! II It is not for him that the eye shall be dim; But his name oft shall hallow the goblet's bright brim; His helm and his sword are as relics adored, And we fondly repeat his last faltering word! III But he must be mourned who in triumph returned, When the battle was over, with laurels well earned: Who seemed to have past thro' the war's fiercest blast— But to fall from before us in sunshine at last! IV The spirit whose light was unsullied and bright, In the moment of danger the front of the fight! Was quenched in the ray of a prosperous day, When the threatning danger had faded away! LOVE'S MINSTREL. (Song composed by J. A. Wade, Esq.) I Once a sage with cold displeasure, Thus reproved a child of song:— “Cease, oh! cease that trifling measure, “Love has been your theme too long! “Go, and seek some nobler story, “Free from vows, and tears, and sighs;— “Sing of hope—of war—of glory: “Sing no more of lips and eyes!” II Soon the Bard obeyed, combining Bolder notes and nobler words, Loudly touched his harp, resigning All the sweetness of its chords! Once his tale of love and beauty With a poet's warmth was told; Now the task, imposed by duty, Seems alas but dull and cold! III “Oh!” he cries, “forgive me, Father, “All my lofty flights are vain. “Keep your laurels—I had rather “Wear Love's myrtle wreath again. “Why should I profane the pages “Some have touched with so much skill! “Sense I leave to sober sages, “I'll be Love's wild minstrel still!” OH! MAY WE HOPE THO' COLD AND DEAD. (English Melody, arranged as a Duet by Sir J. Stevenson.) I Oh! may we hope, tho' cold and dead Her form lies buried here, Her spirit views the tears we shed And nightly hovers near? II No! if our love beyond the skies Survive death's icy kiss, The mourner's tears are veiled from eyes That look on perfect bliss. OH ASK ME NOT FOR SPORTIVE LAYS. (Song composed by Mr. Sinclair.) I Oh ask me not for sportive lays, Like those I used to sing;— The harp you loved in former days, Has lost its sweetest string! And if I sing of youthful joys, I touch my harp in vain: The loss of that one string destroys The beauty of the strain! II Young love had once a harp they say, And with a boy's delight, In summer he would often play Sweet songs from morn till night. But winter came, and Cupid cried, While leaning o'er his lyre, And now, alas! 'tis thrown aside, For tears hath spoilt the wire! AIRS OF HAUT-TON. AWAY WITH NATURE'S MELODIES. I Away with Nature's melodies, Her roses lack variety, Her smiles may suit the Hor- Ticultural Society: I sing of artificial life, Where pleasure drains her chalices, Where fashion cuts out petticoats, And architecture palaces. II Away with brooks, and hooks, and crooks, Your Phœbes and your Phillises; The brain-struck bard who doats upon Each cataract and hill he sees. In winter time to be sublime, My city muse embarrasses; So she shall sing the picturesque, Of villas and of terraces. III Each symptom of the season makes A London man revive again; With joy he sees the busy bees Inhabiting the hive again. He leaves his cards and kind regards; Those little sweet formalities, Expected by all those who show Their entertaining qualities. IV He quits the club, the joint concern, The pigmy tart and sallad, he Resigns the cruet of white wine, For warmer hospitality. And when he sees the plenteous meal, He well may wonder any one Could live so many months upon A four and twenty-penny one. THIS IS MY ELDEST DAUGHTER, SIR. I This is my eldest daughter, Sir, Her mother's only care; You praise her face—Oh! Sir, she is, As good as she is fair. My angel Jane is clever too, Accomplishments I've taught her; I'll introduce you to her, Sir, This is my eldest daughter. II I've sought the aid of ornament, Bejewelling her curls; I've tried her beauty unadorn'd, Simplicity, and pearls: I've set her off, to get her off, Till fallen off I've thought her; Yet I've softly breath'd to all the Beaux, “This is my eldest daughter.” III I've tried all styles of hair dressing, Madonnas, frizzes, crops, Her waist I've lac'd, her back I've brac'd, Till circulation stops: I've padded her, until I have Into a Venus brought her, But puffing her has no effect, This is my eldest daughter. IV Her gowns are à la Ackermann, Her corsets à la Bell; Yet when the season ends, each beau, Still leaves his T. T. L. I patronize each Déjeûné, Each party on the water; Yet still she hangs upon my arm! This is my eldest daughter. V She did refuse a gentleman,— (I own it was absurd,) She thought she ought to answer No! He took her at her word! But she'd say yes if any one That's eligible sought her; She really is a charming girl, Though she's my eldest daughter. LORD HARRY HAS WRITTEN A NOVEL. I Lord Harry has written a Novel, A story of elegant life; No stuff about love in a hovel, No sketch of a commoner's wife: No trash such as pathos and passion, Fine feelings, expression, and wit; But all about people of fashion, Come look at his caps, how they fit II Oh! Radcliffe! thou once wert the charmer, Of girls who sat reading all night; Thy heroes were striplings in armour, Thy heroines damsels in white. But past are thy terrible touches, Our lips in derision we curl, Unless we are told how a Duchess, Convers'd with her cousin the Earl. III We now have each dialogue quite full Of titles—“I give you my word, My lady you're looking delightful,” “Oh! dear, do you think so, my Lord!” “You've heard of the Marquis's marriage, The bride with her jewels new set, Four horses, new travelling carriage, And déjeûné à la fourchette.” IV Haut Ton finds her privacy broken, We trace all her inns and her outs; The very small talk that is spoken, By very great people at routs. At Tenby Miss Jinks asks the loan of The book from the Innkeeper's wife, And reads till she dreams she is one of The leaders of elegant life. MY WIFE IS VERY MUSICAL. I My wife is very musical, She tunes it over much; And teazes me with what they call Her fingering and touch. She's Instrumental to my pain: Her very Broadwood quakes! Her vocal efforts split my brain, I shiver when she shakes! II She tells me, with the greatest ease, Her voice goes up to C, And proves it, till her melodies, Are maladies to me. She's “Isabelling” if I stir, From where my books lie hid; Or, “Oh! no we never mention her;” I wish she never did! III Her newest turns turn out to be, The same we heard last year; Alas! there's no variety, In variations here: I see her puff, I see her pant, Through ditties wild and strange; I wish she'd change her notes, they want Some silver and some change. I MUST COME OUT NEXT SPRING, MAMA. I I must come out next spring, Mama, I must come out next spring; To keep me with my governess, Would be a cruel thing. Whene'er I view my sisters dress'd, In leno and in lace, Miss Twig's apartment seems to be A miserable place. I must come out next spring, Mama, &amp;c. II I'm very sick of Grosvenor Square, The path within the rails; I'm weary of Telemachus, And such outlandish tales: I hate my French—my vile Chambaud, In tears I've turn'd his leaves; Oh! let me Frenchify my hair, And take to gigot sleeves. I must come out next spring, Mama, &amp;c. III I know quite well what I would say To partners at a ball; I've got a pretty speech or two, And they would serve for all. If an Hussar,—I'd praise his horse, And win a smile from him; And if a naval man, I'd lisp, “Pray, Captain, do you swim?” I must come out next spring, Mama, &amp;c. MY HUSBAND MEANS EXTREMELY WELL. I My husband means well, Good, honest, humdrum man; And really I can hardly tell, How first our feuds began. It was a match of my Mama's, No match at all, I mean, Unless declining fifty has One feature like fifteen. II I long'd to leave the prosing set, Papa, and durance vile, I long'd to have a landaulet, And four neat greys in style: Sir William's steeds were thorough bred, He wooed me fourteen days, And I consented, though his head Was greyer than his greys. III For, Oh! I pin'd for pineries, Plate, pin-money, and pearls; For smiles from Royal Highnesses, Dukes, Marquisses, and Earls. Sir William was in Parliament, And noticed by the King, So when he made his settlement, It was a settled thing. IV He grumbles now! a woman's whim Turns night to day, he says, As if he thought I'd sit with him, Benighting all my days! At six he rises, as for me, At twelve I ring my bell; Thus we're wound up alternately, Like buckets in a well. AWAY WITH THE DAYLIGHT. I Away with the daylight, illumine the gas! The moments of morning too languidly pass; 'Tis only at sunset we find out the worth Of stars in the Heavens, and eyes upon earth! Then away with the daylight, &amp;c. II You blame me for keeping late hours; oh! fie; They all become late ones when they are gone by: And all sorts of hours fly from us so fast, I'm resolved I will keep them,—as long as they'll last. Then away with the daylight, &amp;c. III Late hours! oh! for shame! you're a sluggard to me: You were stirring at six, I was dancing at three. Talk of rising with larks! 'tis far better, I say, For a lark when 'tis dark to go roving away. Then away with the daylight, &amp;c. THE MEN ARE ALL CLUBBING TOGETHER. I The men are all clubbing together, Abandoning gentle pursuits, They revel with birds of a feather, And dine in black neck-cloths and boots. They've no party spirit about them, (My parties are stupid concerns,) The ladies sit sulky without them, Or dance with each other by turns. II Oh! where are the dandies who flirted, Who came of a morning to call? We females are so disconcerted, I'd fee males to come to my ball! 'Twas flattery charm'd us—no matter, Paste often may pass for a gem; Alas! we are duller and flatter, Than when we're flatter'd by them. III When family dinners we're giving, They send an excuse,—there's the rub: Each gourmand, secure of good living, Like Hercules, leans on his club. A hermit, though beauty invites him, Alone at the Union he sits, But what is the fare that delights him Compar'd with the fair that he quits? IN THE DAYS OF MY GREAT GRANDMAMA. I In the days of my great Grandmama, I've been told, There were persons of fashion and taste, Who, in dresses as stout as chain armour of old, The parties of Ranelagh grac'd. How high were their heads, and how high were their heels, And how high were their notions and ways! They mov'd in propriety's round like the wheels Of a warranted watch, in the days Of my great Grandmama! II Fashion then was so dull you could scarcely discern The minute ebb and flow of her tides: And a dowager's dress, though unturn'd, serv'd in turn Three or four generations of brides. Like the family jewels, the family gown Was reserv'd for their Gala displays, And a ruffled old lady look'd placidly down Upon ruffled young girls, in the days Of my great Grandmama! III Oh! the men, who for these female paragons sigh'd, Were unlike those who pester us now; They approach'd with a smile, and a sink, and a slide, And a minuet step and a bow. They were lac'd and embroider'd, and powder'd, and curl'd, Like the men that we see in the plays; And 'tis certain there's nothing so grand in the world, Or so sweet as there was in the days Of my great Grandmama! OH! LET NOT YOUR PASSION FOR MARY THE MAID. I Oh! let not your passion for Mary the maid, Cause you, my Lord Harry, to blush; When beauty ennobles, immediately fade Birth, parentage, duster, and brush. E'en pride from her presence shall never recoil, Her smiles all impediments soften, And who is more likely to make the pot boil Than she who has boil'd it so often? II Then throw by your gun, it might worry her nerves, As she settles her sweets on the shelf; And why should you shoot on a neighbour's preserves, When she's making preserves for yourself: She will prove to you soon, if you raise her aloft, She is worthy the warmest of lovers! She will superintend all your courses, and oft Give new zest to the scent of your covers. III Regard not her frown—you may penetrate stone, By the dripping of water they say; Take courage, your pretty plain cook is not one On whom dripping can be thrown away. You shrink from nobility's daughter who loves To freeze you with manners majestic, And your choice of a partner for life only proves That your habits are strictly domestic. AT HOME. I Invitations I will write, All the world I will invite. I will deign to show civility, To the tip tops of gentility; To the cream of the nobility, I'm “at home” next Monday night. II See my footman, how he runs! Ev'ry paltry street he shuns, I'm “at home” to peers and peeresses, Who reside in squares and terraces, I'm “at home” to heirs and heiresses, And, of course, to eldest sons. III I'm “at home” to all the set, Of exclusives I have met. If a rival open has her doors, All the coronets shall pass her doors, I'm “at home” to the Ambassadors, Though their names I quite forgot. IV I'm “at home” to guardsmen all, Be they short, or be they tall; I'm “at home” to men political, Poetical and critical, And the punning men of wit, I call Acquisitions at a ball. V Oh! the matchless Collinet, On his flageolet shall play; How I love to hear the thrill of it! Pasta's song think what she will of it, He will make a quick quadrille of it, “Dove sono,”—dance away. NOT AT HOME. I Not at home! not at home! close my curtain again, Go and send the intruders away; They may knock if they will, but 'tis labour in vain, For I am not made up for the day. Though my ball was the best of all possible balls, Though I graced my saloon like a Queen; I've a head-ache to-day, so if any one calls, “Not at home!” I am not to be seen. II Not at home! not at home! bring strong coffee at two, But now leave me to doze in the dark; I'm too pale for my pink! I'm too brown for my blue, I'm too sick for my drive in the park. If the man whose attentions are pointed should call, (Eliza, you know who I mean,) Oh! say, when he knocks, I'm knock'd up by my ball, “Not at home!” I am not to be seen. III Not at home to Sir John, not at home to the Count, Not at home till my ringlets are curl'd; Should the Jeweller call with his little account, Not at home! not at home for the world! I, at midnight must shine at three splendid “at homes,” Then adieu to my morning chagrin, Close my curtain again, for till candle-light comes, “Not at home!” I am not to be seen. SONGS FOR THE GRAVE AND GAY. ROMANCE FOR ME. I Romance for me, Romance for me, Not matter of fact and history, And prosing volumes all about— “Once on a time it so fell out.” Romance for me, Romance for me, And a nice little bit of a mystery! II I hate the noon—give me the moon, And dewy nights in May or June: Dull Prudence sighs, and trims her lamp, And talks about cold, night-air, and damp! Romance for me, Romance for me, And a nice little bit of a mystery! III Give me the loves of turtle doves, Who bill and coo in shadowy groves; Give me Romance, and I'll dispense With the rodomontade of common sense. Romance for me, Romance for me, And a nice little bit of a mystery! THERE IS NOT ONE FAMILIAR FACE. There is not one familiar face Where many loved me once! I speak aloud—the lonely place Returns no kind response! Where I and others roved, I see Another roving race; Gay smiles are there—but ah! for me, Not one familiar face! Where are they now, the young, the gay? No longer gay and young; O'er some, too early snatched away, The cold earth has been flung. The rapid stream—the shelter'd seat— Each spot unchanged I trace, But mournful is the scene—I meet Not one familiar face! HE PASS'D! He pass'd, as if he knew me not, Unconscious I was near! And can he then so soon forget A being once so dear! No—through composure ill assumed— I marked the blush of shame; I saw him tremble when he heard Another breathe my name. I ask not now a lover's smile— These eyes are sunk and dim; But in their ruin, they possess An eloquence for him; Though others pass me—from his heart More sympathy I claim; When I am gone—perchance he'll weep Whene'er he hears my name. I KNOW A SPOT. I I know a spot, where we scarce mark the flowers That Spring scatters round her to tell us she's come; I know a spot, where the evergreen bowers Are bright in all seasons—that dear spot is home. II I know a spot, where in Winter's rough weather We laugh while the elements bluster and foam; I know a spot, where when met thus together We've smiles for all seasons—that dear spot is home. OH TEACH MY HEART. I Oh! teach my heart that chilling lore That the world hath taught to Thee. While I am on the sunny shore, What are ocean storms to Me? Oh! some that with me used to sail, Now wreck'd 'neath the waters lie; But we have felt no adverse gale, We will coldly pass them by. II Yet oh! begone—I'll not be taught Such a heartless lore as this; In memory's tomb the charm is sought, And I scorn such a selfish bliss. I will not own 'tis weak to weep When the friends who loved us die, No—I'll seek the scene of their chill sleep, And not coldly pass them by. OH NOT FOR ME! I A little breeze waves the willow That droops across the stream, And ev'ry infant billow Sports with a bright sunbeam; Go forth—go forth—there's joy for thee, But not for me! oh not for me! II I shun the sunny meadow, I seek the church-yard's gloom, Beneath the yew tree's shadow, I weep o'er Laura's tomb. Go forth—go forth—there's joy for thee, But not for me! oh not for me! TEN YEARS AGO! I Ten years ago in this place we met, And we meet as gaily now! For Time has but little changed as yet, Youth's joyous lip and brow. Above us, the tree a canopy weaves, 'Tis a fanciful thought I know— But I almost could think they're the same green leaves That were here ten years ago! II Ten years ago! yet each word and look Are fresh as if just gone by! They were traced in memory's treasure book, And the ink seems scarcely dry! The mariner's barque has encountered storms, From his lip no complaint shall flow, If the barque be mann'd by the same gay forms That were there ten years ago! UPBRAID ME NOT. I Upbraid me not, I little heed The bitter words you speak: The worst reproach that you can use Is on that faded cheek. And though a threat would fail to rouse My feelings or my fears, This heart is touch'd by your despair, And trembles at your tears. II How well do I remember you In all your spring of youth, Believing each fair word and smile Arose from simple truth. Upbraid me not—the false one scorns The threaten'd doom he hears;— This heart is touched by your despair, And trembles at your tears. SAY WHERE IS VIRTUE'S DWELLING? Say where is virtue's dwelling? Where nuns their beads are telling; On the earth kneeling, Cold and unfeeling, Not where the devotee drearily, Paces the nunnery, wearily, At the world railing, Weeping and wailing; That is not Virtue's throne. Where then is Virtue's dwelling? Where the young heart, excelling, Little professes, Meekly possesses Innocent thoughts alone; Sharing life's sunshine readily, Stemming life's tempests steadily; That may be Virtue's throne. I CAN NEVER LOVE YOU MORE. I ne'er will love you less, But I cannot love you more, Nor can I now profess To have warmer vows in store: Words may not quite express How sincerely I adore— I can never love you less, I can never love you more! My love is now full grown, The infant at its birth Could never know, I own One quarter of your worth: But having learnt to bless Your virtues o'er and o'er, I can never love you less, I can never love you more! SONGS OF FASHIONABLE LIFE. NOT GO TO TOWN THIS SPRING, PAPA! I “Not go to town this spring, Papa! Mama! not go to town! I never knew you so unkind, you chill me with that frown; Pray, Mama, indulge your pet, entreat Papa to go; Ah! now I see that you're in tears, we shall succeed I know!” II “Alas! my child, I've done my best, and argued all day long; But men are always obstinate, especially when wrong. 'Tis for my girl I urge the trip, not for myself, alas! But when I married had I known—no matter, let that pass!” III “My dear, you know that I abhor these silly discontents; You're quite absurd, why don't you make the people pay their rents? I can't afford a house in town, nay, don't put on that sneer, For once be happy where you are, we'll go to town next year.” IV “Your conduct, Sir, is most absurd, we went last year in June, But Fanny really had no chance, you took us home so soon: Sir Charles was evidently struck, I'm sure he would have popp'd, But then he saw no more of us, and so the matter dropt.” V “Of course my dear! you stay with us?”—“No, darling, no, not so, My duties parliamentary, force me alas! to go.” “You can't afford a house in town!”—“No, sweetest! there's the rub; For I shall sleep at Batt's you know, and dine, love! at the club.” VI “The club! I hate that odious word, the bane of wedded life, For well the roving husband fares, no matter how the wife! And then the thing's a vile excuse, which we must take perforce, ‘Where have you been this afternoon?’ Oh! at the club of course!” VII “Why rail at clubs, dear Mistress G. you know I never play, I only meet some college friends and spend a quiet day; For when at home I nothing hear, but parties, dress, and balls, Except it's when you scold the maids, or Fanny thrums and squalls.” VIII “I hate all clubs! but I abhor the Athenæum most. They ask the ladies We'nesday nights! it's all a braggart boast: To shew their gilt and or-molu, each anxious member strives, And seems to say, snug quarters these, what do we want with wives?” IX “Come, dearest Fanny, dry your eyes, a leetle rouge put on; I'll order you a sweet chapeau from Maradon Carson, The races and the archeries will very soon be here, Come, dearest! you shall not be vex'd, we will go to town next year.” THE ARCHERY MEETING. I The archery meeting is fixed for the third; The fuss that it causes is truly absurd; I've bought summer bonnets for Rosa and Bess, And now I must buy each an archery dress! Without a green suit they would blush to be seen, And poor little Rosa looks horrid in green! II Poor fat little Rosa! she's shooting all day! She sends forth an arrow expertly they say; But 'tis terrible when with exertion she warms, And she seems to me getting such muscular arms; And if she should hit, 'twere as well if she missed it, Prize bracelets could never be clasp'd on her wrist! III Dear Bess with her elegant figure and face, Looks quite a Diana, the queen of the place; But as for the shooting—she never takes aim; She talks so, and laughs so! the beaux are to blame: She doats on flirtation—but oh! by the bye, 'Twas awkward her shooting out Mrs. Flint's eye! IV They've made my poor husband an archer elect; He dresses the part with prodigious effect; A pair of nankeens, with a belt round his waist, And a quiver of course in which arrows are placed; And a bow in his hand—oh! he looks of all things Like a corpulent Cupid bereft of his wings! V They dance on the lawn, and we mothers, alas! Must sit on camp stools with our feet in the grass; My Flora and Bessy no partners attract! The Archery men are all cross Beaux in fact! Among the young Ladies some hits there may be, But still at my elbow two misses I see! I'M JUST EIGHTEEN, AND QUITE A MAN. I I'm just eighteen, and quite a man, I'm no Etonian now; Don't call me boy! such liberties I never will allow, One's own relations bore one so; when we go out to dine, I wish my mother would not say “John, don't take too much wine.” II My face is smooth, but bear's grease brings mustachios and a tuft; I know my figure's rather slight, but then my coat is stuff'd; My legs are long, and if they are as straight as my father's staff, In black cloth trousers what's the use of having any calf? III Said Lady Trippet when she asked my mother to her ball, If your young people are at home, I beg you'll bring them all, The odious term included me! I'll stay at home, I vow. “Young people” means the boys and girls, I'm no young person now. IV My sister Kate in confidence has told me that Miss King Has raved about me, ever since she saw me in the spring; Poor girl! I must contrive to be less pleasant if I can, And Kate must tell her candidly I'm not a marrying man. FOR FIFTEEN SPRINGS I HAVE BEEN OUT. I For fifteen springs I have been out, and I am thirty-three! I never get proposals now, what can the reason be? All strangers guess me twenty one and praise me to the skies, Because I have such pearly teeth and animated eyes. II Would none but strangers saw me now! Alas it is my lot To dwell where I have always dwelt, half rooted to the spot! Children who shared my childish sports have children of their own, And brats I once look'd down upon, are men and women grown! III Last week a gallant son of Mars invited me to dance: We laughed, we talked! I really thought once more I had a chance! At length he said “My dear Miss Smith, you don't remember me! I'm William Jones, twelve years ago, you danced me on your knee!” IV When fashionably dress'd, some friend exclaims “Miss Smith I know You must remember sleeves like these, at least ten years ago.” The sweetest fruit is that which hangs the longest on the tree, For fifteeen springs I have been out, and I am thirty three! WHAT IS LONDON'S LAST NEW LION? I What is London's last new lion? Pray inform me if you can; Is't a woman of Kamschatka or an Otaheite man? For my conversazione, you must send me something new, Don't forget me! Oh I sigh for the éclat of a début! II I am sick of all the “minstrels,” all the “brothers” this and that; Who sing sweetly at the parties, while the ladies laugh and chat; And the man who play'd upon his chin is passé I suppose, So try and find a gentleman who plays upon his nose. III Send half a dozen authors, for they help to fill a rout, I fear I've worn the literary lionesses out! Send something biographical, I think that fashion spreads, But do not send a poet, till you find one with two heads. IV The town has grown fastidious; we do not care a straw For the whiskers of a bandit, or the tail of a bashaw! And travellers are out of date, I mean to cut them soon, Unless you send me some one who has travell'd to the moon. V Oh! if you send a singer, he must sing without a throat! Oh! if you send a player, he must harp upon one note! I must have something marvellous, the marvel makes the man; What is London's last new lion? pray inform me if you can. THE LAST MAN OF THE SEASON. I Behold the last man of the season Left pacing the park all alone, He'll blush if you ask him the reason, Why he with the rest is not gone? He'll see you with shame and with sorrow, He'll smile with affected delight; He'll swear he leaves London to-morrow, And only came to it last night! II He'll tell you that nobles select him To cheer their romantic retreats, That friends from all quarters expect him To stay at their elegant seats. Invited by all, then, how can he know Which he should favour or shun; He's sure of offending so many, By paying a visit to one. III He'll say that the Yacht Club implore him To cruise in their exquisite ships: That ladies of fashion quite bore him To join in their wandering trips: That stewards of all races entreat him To go to them; what can he do? So odd you should happen to meet him, So strange as he's just passing through. IV In town, in the month of September, We find neither riches nor rank; In vain we look out for a member To give us a nod or a frank. Each knocker in silence reposes, In every mansion you find One dirty old woman who dozes, Or peeps through the dining-room blind! V Then hence, thou last man of the season; Lest fashion the outrage should blab! Shrink back as if guilty of treason Within the dark depths of thy cab. If money be wanting, go borrow, Remain—and thy character's lost! Go print thy departure to-morrow: “Sir Linger from Longs to the coast!” SONGS FROM A FOREIGN LAND. OH! THIS WORLD OF OURS. I Oh! this world of ours, With the path that leads to death, With the thinly scatter'd flowers, And the cold, cold, ice beneath! And the warm hearts we have met, But to lose them and to mourn; And the ever sad regret, For what can never return! Oh! this world of shame and sin, This weary world of ours; The canker worm is at work within The fairest of her flowers. II Think of earthly treasure As a thing that cannot last; Oh! judge of future pleasure By the false joys of the past; Thou wilt learn how to disdain All that mortals covet most, Slow to grasp what thou may'st gain, Slow to mourn what thou hast lost. Oh! this world of shame and sin, This weary world of ours; The canker worm is at work within The fairest of her flowers. NEVER, MY CHILD, FORGET TO PRAY. I Never, my child, forget to pray, Whate'er the business of the day. If happy dreams have bless'd thy sleep, If startling fears have made thee weep, With holy thoughts begin the day; And ne'er, my child, forget to pray. II Pray Him, by whom the birds are fed, To give to thee thy daily bread; If wealth his bounty should bestow, Praise Him from whom all blessings flow. If He who gave should take away, Oh! ne'er, my child, forget to pray. III A time may come when thou wilt miss A father's and a mother's kiss, And then, my child, perchance thou'lt see, Some who in pray'r ne'er bend their knee; From such examples turn away, And ne'er, my child, forget to pray. WHY AT THAT MERRY STRAIN. I Why at that merry strain do my tears flow? Because alas! in vain, I would recall again The friend with whom I heard it long ago. And thus tho' 'tis a measure That speaks to thee of pleasure, To me it hath a melancholy tone, And whispers joy is gone—for ever gone. II Yet oh! that merry strain is still my choice, I cannot call it pain, I seem to hear again The murmur of a dear familiar voice. And thus tho' 'tis a measure That speaks to thee of pleasure, To me it hath a melancholy tone, And whispers joy is gone—for ever gone. OH! CALL IT NOT FOLLY. I Oh! call it not folly, you libel good spirits, He surely is wisest whose heart is most gay, Who looks on mankind but to find out the merits Of those who may chance to be thrown in his way. I know that you think me a volatile being, In truth I am more apt to hope than to fear, And why should I darken the present, for seeing A far distant cloud which may never come near? II Oh! if it be folly, why should you endeavour To end a delusion so happy for me; Ne'er teach me your wisdom, but suffer me ever To search out the bright side of all that I see. Why tell me how changing is woman's affection, Why tell me how fleeting the friendship of man; Both please me, and therefore I see no objection To think them faithful—as long as I can. I LOVE TO PACE THE RUIN'D CELL. I I love to pace the ruin'd cell Where cloister'd monks were wont to dwell, They heard the tolling of the bell With parade of sanctity. I view the wild flow'r on the wall, Their marble tombs neglected fall, And with the psalmist say that all, All—all, is vanity! II Though built for penitence and pray'r, Unholy thoughts have enter'd there And secret sin must ever share, The secret misery. More happy and more holy they, Who purely live, and meekly pray, And shun a proud, yet false display, For all, all is vanity! OH! VIRTUE KNOWS NO HOPELESS GRIEF. I Oh! virtue knows no hopeless grief, 'Tis sin that must despair; The true believer finds relief In solitary pray'r; And faith will take her holy flight, To realms beyond the tomb; They will not madly mourn the blight, Who knows how frail the bloom. II Then say not to a hopeless lot We're fetter'd from our birth, It would be hopeless, had we not A hope beyond the earth: The infidel may well despond, When sorrow's tear he sheds, His bosom knows no hope beyond The dust on which he treads. FILL PLEASURE'S BOWL. I Fill pleasure's bowl at Lethe's stream, And I'll be gay at last; The draught that makes the future bright, Must drown the dreary past. But fill me not the bowl with wine, I shun the dull excess; For that which makes you light of heart My spirits would depress. II Oh! you see around the board, The friends you wish to meet; Where once the smile of friendship shone, You'll view no vacant seat; Their laughing mirth to one so blest You pleasure will impart; And songs of love are sure to find An echo in your heart. III Then, fill me not the bowl with wine, But fill at Lethe's stream, Drive sad regret from daily thought, And from my troubled dream: Let unawaken'd mem'ry lie, As at an infant's birth; And hope again may make me prize The future scenes of earth. IV But no,—it is an idle thought, I ask the boon in vain; I never at the social board Can be a guest again; Their laughing mirth to one so sad New sadness will impart, And songs of love are sure to find An echo in my heart. SIMILITUDES FOR WOMAN. I They err, who seek in earth or air Similitudes for woman; Or in the sea, for nothing there Is half so good, or half so fair, Her worth is too uncommon, For us to find a simile In all the earth,—the air,—the sea. II Go cull the roses of the earth, The pearls beneath the ocean; But rose and pearl are little worth Fair woman's cheek when flushed with mirth, Or pale with sad emotion. Ah no—there is no simile, For her, in earth,—or air,—or sea. III Go gaze upon the deep blue sky, In summer's sweetest weather; Then look on woman's bright blue eye, And tell the bard you wonder why, He names the two together! In her fair face her mind we see, For that there is no simile. COULD SORROW KILL. I Could sorrow kill, you would not see me here, But 'gainst my will, I linger still, With none my path to cheer. And am I wrong to wish for a release, To shun the throng, And dance, and song, And sigh for peace. If wrong it be, then woe is me! The crime's akin to misery. II “Be comforted,” you say with kind intent, Nor would I shed Tears for the dead, The pure, the innocent. But I am wrong in being thus subdued, Whose love most strong, Encouraged long, Met base ingratitude! If wrong it be, then woe is me! The crime's akin to misery. LOVE LIKE THE WEARY BIRD. I There's a time when we feel the want of friends, The early one's the best, When love, like a weary bird, descends To find a place of rest; And finds on all the earth not one Familiar spot to rest upon. II The snow may cover each once green tree, The bird, alas! finds no repose; And love as sad a change may see, Hearts chill'd by worldly snows! With weary wing the bird must fly, And wounded love must soar on high! SONGS OF THE OLD CHATEAU. THE TAPESTRY WAVES IN THE BREEZE OF THE NIGHT. I The tapestry waves in the breeze of the night, And the figures it bears, in the pale moonlight, Seem frowning upon me,—I tremble with fear. Dim shadows I see, and low murmurs I hear! My lamp is expiring—Oh, speed, my love, speed! I listen in vain for the tramp of his steed. II Hark! hark! 'tis the bell of the castle tolls One, The silence how deep now the echoes are gone! And, hush! in the gallery, near and more near, A slow hollow footstep distinctly I hear. My lamp is expiring—Oh, speed, my love, speed! I listen in vain for the tramp of his steed. III The door of my chamber wide open is thrown, A figure stands there like a statue of stone: It raises its helmet—I laugh at my fear, 'Tis my lover I view—'tis my lover I hear! My lamp's fading glimmer no longer I heed, I listen no more for the tramp of his steed. I'VE HEARD MY OWN DEAR MOTHER SING. I I've heard my own dear mother sing a song of other times; 'Twas one she valued more than all her store of ballad rhymes. The theme was one that's often sung—the faithlessness of man; I cannot tell the story now, but thus the burden ran: Beware, beware, O ladies fair, Of man's deceit!—beware. II I wonder'd why my mother wept, for then she still was young; Yet, with a touching earnestness, these warning lines she sung: I used to think, “Man may be false, but what is that to us?” Yet, when I said, “Come sing to me,” her burden still ran thus; Beware, beware, O ladies fair, Of man's deceit!—beware. III I never more shall hear that song from those dear lips again, But in my mind remember'd still those warning words remain. I thought not of them when I heard a lover's ardent vow; But, oh! my mother! feelingly I sing that burden now: Beware, beware, O ladies fair, Of man's deceit!—beware. L'ESPERANCE. I Who gazes so long on each glittering light That beams from the walls of yon castle to-night: Its lord, if he knew that Sir Leon is near, Would watch his fair child with suspicion and fear. She smiles at the feast where gay nobles are met, But she thinks of the knight she was told to forget. Sir Leon be bold, never think of mischance, Trust to honour and truth, L'Espérance, L'Espérance! II The minstrels come forth, and light measures they play, Each guest wears a mask and fantastic array; The peasant and prince meet to laugh and to jest, And the lord of the east woes the lass of the west. A pilgrim in grey to fair Emmeline kneels, Whose mask scarcely veils the delight that she feels. Sir Leon be bold, lead her forth to the dance, Trust to honour and truth, L'Espérance, L'Espérance! III The morning is come, and with helm, spear, and shield, The nobles are seen riding forth to the field; The knight who prevails with his lance and his sword, Is to marry the child of the castle's proud lord. Each rival o'erthrown on the earth fainting lies, While a stranger kneels down for the conqueror's prize; Sir Leon is bold, and he wields a good lance, Here's to honour and truth, L'Espérance, L'Espérance! GUESS THE NAME. I I have drain'd the cup they brought me In the banquet hall of mirth; I have breath'd the name they taught me As the dearest name on earth; But in secret I abhor it, Such a pledge would chill the wine, I've a health far dearer for it; Guess the name—dear love, 'tis thine! II I have been where bright eyes glancing, Shamed the gems that shone around; Where the young and gay were dancing To the lute's melodious sound; But my constant heart still shrinking From the charms they deemed divine, Of a dearer name was thinking; Guess that name—dear love, 'tis thine! III I have sought the distant places Fam'd for beauty's 'witching glance, From Circassia's languid graces To the laughing dames of France: But my thoughts still homeward flying To seek out their chosen shrine, For a dearer name were sighing; Guess the name—dear love, 'twas thine! I WORE THE ROBES OF A NOBLE BRIDE. I I wore the robes of a noble bride, And a white wreath bound my hair; I knelt by my own true lover's side, And the priest was standing there; But the ring fell from my trembling hand, And the bridegroom himself was dumb, For we heard the tramp of a warlike band, And the sound of a distant drum. II Oh! little we thought of the bridal feast, I wept on my bridal day; The gates were closed, and every guest Turn'd mournfully away: Despair's unseen resistless wand My senses did benumb; And I heard the tramp of a warlike band, And the sound of a distant drum. III My husband kissed my pallid cheek, And said he would return. I tried to smile—I could not speak, My heart was too forlorn. I know he fell in a foreign land, Though they say that he soon will come, For I hear no tramp of a warlike band, And no sound of a distant drum. TELL ME THAT HE LIVES. I Tell me that he lives and I'll smile again, Though his limbs be gall'd by a tyrant's chain, Time may burst the link, captives may go free, Tell me that he lives and give life to me. Wounded he may pine in a foreign land, And his sword may fall from his nerveless hand; He may live to wear Fame's unfading wreath, Oh! my constant heart could not bear his death. II Tell me that he lives; I can bear to know He is false to me—say if it be so? Not one selfish thought lingers in my breast; Tell me that he lives, I'll endure the rest. Pallid is my cheek and my eye is dim, He would scarcely know her who weeps for him; He may live to wear Fame's unfading wreath, Oh! my constant heart could not bear his death. THOSE JOYOUS VILLAGE BELLS. I Oh! I cannot bear the sound Of those joyous village bells. Mournful music should be found In the halls where sorrow dwells. Once for me those bells were rung, And the bridal song was sung; Wretched is the bride who hears Sounds like those with tears. II Now I see the laughing train, Youths and maidens dancing forth; I'll not look on them again, Eyes like mine would mar their mirth. Once for me those bells were rung, And the bridal song was sung; Wretched is the bride who hears Sounds like those with tears. COME DECK ME FOR THE DANCE AGAIN. I Come deck me for the dance again, For I will be the brightest there; Bring silken robe and jewell'd chain, And blooming roses for my hair. The world again shall deem me gay, My sombre weeds aside are thrown; You bid me smile—and I obey, But solitude is still my own. II I know my feelings must be blamed By those who never felt like me; They think a moment may be named, When grief shall set the mourner free; The harp, so long unstrung, they say, Should then resume its wonted tone. You bid me smile, and I obey, But solitude is still my own. THINK NOT OF ME, POOR PAGE. I My page, look not wistfully Upon thy lady's cheek, For she can read in thy moist eye The grief thou fain wouldst speak. Thy kindness but augments the pain It offers to assuage; Go, seek thy sunny sports again, Think not of me, poor page. II My sadness will but make thee weep; Thou'lt win no smile from me; So young a plant 'twere sin to keep Beneath woe's poison tree. I love thee, but I send thee forth A captive from the cage. I have no other friend on earth, But heed not that, poor page. III And thou dost weep, remembering How gay I us'd to be; Weep not, for nothing now can bring A sadder change to me. Bow'd down in youth, I do not fear The darkest frowns of age. Go hence, I cannot shed a tear; Think not of me, poor page. IT WAS A DREAM. I It was a dream of perfect bliss Too beautiful to last; I seemed to welcome back again The bright days of the past. I was a boy—my mimic ship Sail'd down the village stream, And I was gay and innocent— But, ah! it was a dream. II And soon I left the childish toy, For those of manhood's choice; The beauty of a woman's form, The sweetness of her voice. I thought she gave me blameless love, The nurseling of esteem, And that I merited such love— But, ah! it was a dream. III I saw my falsehood wound her heart, I saw her cheek grow pale; But o'er her fate the vision threw A bright delusive veil. I thought she lived, and that I saw Our bridal torches gleam; And I was happy with my bride— But ah! it was a dream. I WISH I COULD REMEMBER. I I wish I could remember The melody she sung; It flits across my memory, It trembles on my tongue. Again those sweet notes haunt me, In accents like her own! But ere I can connect them Those few wild notes are flown. II 'Tis like a dreamer waking From slumbers that are blest; Fair visions have been hovering Around his place of rest. The forms that smiled upon him, Then vanish one by one; In vain he would recall them, 'Tis day—and they are gone. III Yet often do I fancy I have the air and words; I hasten to my harp again, And trifle with its chords. Some notes recur, but with them Come thoughts of other years; The air is gone, it owns not Companionship with tears. PEASANTS SAY MY HOME IS HAUNTED. I Peasants say my home is haunted By a phantom cloth'd in white; And unearthly strains are chaunted In my halls at dead of night. But the tale is idly spoken, I behold no shadowy guest; Though, alas! my sleep is broken By remorse that cannot rest. II If, indeed, the dead have power To descend from realms above; Come to me at that dark hour, Sainted spirit of my love! Come! I will not shrink with terror From thy glance—reveng'd thou art; Thou shall see the slave of error Dying of a broken heart. III Come! I think that it would cheer me, Hopeless as my soul hath been, To behold thee hover near me, Pointing to a brighter scene. Yes,—I feel by thee forgiven These despairing pangs would cease; I may dare look up to heaven, And, though guilty, die in peace! SONGS TO ROSA. WHEN FIRST WE MET. I When first we met, I gaz'd on thee, As on some spirit from above; Whose beauty seem'd too pure to be Profan'd by thoughts of earthly love, When noble friends around thee mov'd, And life's most precious gifts were thine How could I dare confess I lov'd? How could I hope to call thee mine? II But when I saw thy bright eyes seek For me amid the glitt'ring throng— When I was told that lovely cheek Grew paler if I linger'd long; And when I knew thou didst not shun The path where I was sure to be, Was I to blame for loving one Who deign'd to own her love for me? III Though many tell me thou hast smil'd On others kindly as on me; And that my heart has been beguil'd By a mere trifler's vanity, I cannot—will not think it true, Nor link thy name with woman's guile; If it be so,—Ah! then adieu To woman's love and woman's smile. YES! WE WILL MEET! (Air from Nina.) I Yes, we will meet as the coldest have met— Yes, we will part with no sigh of regret; Oh! if those eyes dare to look upon me, Why should I shrink from a meeting with thee! II Come with the smile of a saint on thy brow, Come with the friends who are dear to thee now: If in my soul lurks no thought of deceit, Say is it I that should blush when we meet? ISLE OF BEAUTY. (Original Air.) I Shades of evening close not o'er us, Leave our lonely bark awhile! Morn alas! will not restore us Yonder dim and distant Isle. Still my fancy can discover Sunny spots where friends may dwell, Darker shadows round us hover,— Isle of beauty, Fare-thee-well! II 'Tis the hour when happy faces Smile around the taper's light, Who will fill our vacant places? Who will sing our songs to-night? Through the mist that floats above us Faintly sounds the Vesper bell, Like a voice from those who love us. Breathing fondly “Fare-thee-well!” O COME TO ME. (Original Air, by T. H. B.) I Oh come to me, and bring with thee The sunny smiles of former years; If smiles so bright will lend their light To cheer a brow long used to tears. I will not let one sad regret, One gloomy thought, our meeting chill, But for thy sake, I'll strive to make This altered cheek look cheerful still. II But if the gloom of life is come, If smiles have now forsaken thee; Then let not pride attempt to hide The dreary change, but come to me: If thou art gay I will not say One gloomy word to cause a tear; If thou art sad, I'll wish I had A brighter home for one so dear. III Then come to me, our theme shall be The friends we love, not those we mourn. We'll not destroy a present joy, Lamenting joys that ne'er return; The ardent rays of early days, And boyhood's bloom, we ne'er may see; But days of bright and pure delight May be in store, then come to me. WHEN THE BEE. (Spanish Air.) I When the bee from the roses has taken her flight, When the butterfly closes her wing for the night; When the dew makes the flower more fragrant and fair: Then haste to your bower and I will be there. II Oh! sages may ponder on wandering stars, While true lovers wander with tell tale guitars! I'll sing at that hour your favourite air; Then haste to the bower and I will be there. OH! WHAT A PITY! (French Air.) I Beauty and Love once met in sunny weather, “Sweet Boy,” she cried, in her persuasive tone; “Come we will rove through Pleasure's path together, Oh! what a pity Love should be alone.” II How could young Love suspect when Beauty sought him, Sorrow was near! Alas! he's very blind! Day after day her brightest gifts she brought him, Oh! what a pity Beauty was so kind! III Prudence now call'd, and whisper'd “You must only Trifle with Love, beware your heart's unhurt.” Cupid was left to thoughts most sad and lonely; Oh! what a pity Beauty was a flirt! IV Ladies beware before you give a lover Too many smiles, keep prudence within call; If sorrow come when your flirtation's over, Oh! what a pity Love must bear it all! LILLA'S A LADY. (German Air.) I The church bells are ringing, the village is gay, And Lilla is deck'd in her bridal array. She's woo'd and she's won By a proud baron's son— And Lilla's a lady. II And see o'er the valley who rides at full speed, A gallant young knight on a spirited steed, And why starts the youth When they tell him the truth— That Lilla's a lady. III He's smiling in scorn or he's smiling in jest, While three snow white lilies he takes from his breast; “A poor maid,” says he, “Gave this token to me,— “But Lilla's a lady.” IV “These sweet little lilies that grew in the shade, Transplanted to sunshine, unnoticed may fade; Though mere words of course, You may yet feel their force— Since Lilla's a lady.” V “I came here misled by a false woman's vow. I will stay to drink health to the baroness now. And oh! it will be Quite as pleasant to me— Since Lilla's a lady.” VI “Believe not I'll pine,—no, I travelled so far For the girl that you seem'd, not the girl that you are; You are woo'd, you are won By a proud baron's son— And Lilla's a lady.” OH! DO NOT CHIDE ME. (Indian Air.) I Oh! do not chide me for the tears I shed; Oh! do not tell me, Rosa is not dead; Where are the bright eyes that I used to see? Where are the sweet smiles? They are dead to me! II Say not that Rosa smiles upon the gay; Say not her beauty fadeth not away; Still must I wander where she us'd to be; Still must I mourn her—she is dead to me! THE EVERGREEN LEAF. (Original Air.) I “Farewell!” exclaimed Rosa, “dear Roland away! My father decrees it, and we must obey; Yet though I complain not, and bow to his will; In secret, in silence, I'll think of you still.” II “In dreams those dear features before me shall rise; Your bright sunny hair, and your happy blue eyes: My love defies all that the future can bring, Like the evergreen leaf on the emerald ring.” III The maiden is borne to a far distant isle, New friends court her favour, new lovers her smile. Her tears are forgotten, a stranger is near Who breathes the fond language of love in her ear! IV Jet black are his ringlets and dark is his brow; Oh! where is her sunny hair'd favourite now? Alas! is affection so fleeting a thing? Unlike the green leaf on the emerald ring. V Can Rosa be faithless? No—dull are the eyes Of the girl who detects not her lover's disguise: He darkens the tint of his features in vain, The expression so dear to her still must remain. VI No stranger is there, it is Roland she hears, And answers his fond vows with eloquent tears. Then say not that love is a frivolous thing, 'Tis the evergreen leaf on the emerald ring. GO, ROSA, GO! (Original Air.) I Go, Rosa, go! at once farewell, Since faithless I have found thee; Nay, do not quite destroy the spell, That my fancy shed around thee. If thou had'st seem'd, what thou hast prov'd, I never should have sought thee: Alas! it was not thee I lov'd, But the artless girl I thought thee. II Go dance with other youths to-night, Where we have danced together; Go prove thy heart to be as light As the down upon thy feather. Go rove where we have often rov'd, Go smile as pride hath taught thee; Alas! it was not thee I lov'd, But the artless girl I thought thee. BALLADS. OH! 'TIS THE MELODY. I Oh! 'tis the melody We heard in former years; Each note recalls to me Forgotten smiles and tears. Tears caused by fleeting woes I then believed severe, Smiles that were shared by those Whose smiles were very dear. Sing then, oh! sing to me, How sweet each note appears! Oh! 'tis the melody, We heard in former years. II Ay, I remember well, When last I heard that lay, 'Twas in a sunny dell, Just at the close of day. Garlands of roses made A roof from bough to bough, Friends sat beneath the shade— Alas! where are they now? Sing then, oh! sing to me, &amp;c. III Ay, I remember too Who sweetly sang and play'd, Yet half ashamed to view The circle she had made. Smiling to hear the sound Of her own voice and lute, Blushing to look around On list'ners so mute. Sing then, oh! sing to me, &amp;c. THE ROVER'S BRIDE. I Oh! if you love me furl your sails, Draw up your boat on shore; Come tell me of the midnight gales, But tempt their might no more. II “Oh! stay,” Kate whispered, “stay with me.” “Fear not” the Rover cried, “Yon bark shall be a prize for me, I'll seize it for my bride.” III The boat was in pursuit, it flew, The full sails bent the mast, Poor Kate well knew the Rover's crew Would struggle to the last. IV Then, ceaselessly, for morning's light She prayed upon her knees; For, all the night, the sounds of fight Were borne upon the breeze. V When morning came it brought despair, The Rover's boat was gone! Kate rent her hair; one bark was there Triumphant, but alone. VI She sought the shore, she braved the storm, A corpse lay by her side! She strove to warm the Rover's form, She kiss'd his lips, and died. THE SOLDIER'S TEAR. I Upon the hill he turned, To take a last fond look Of the valley, and the village church, And the cottage by the brook. He listen'd to the sounds So familiar to his ear, And the soldier leant upon his sword, And wiped away a tear. II Beside that cottage porch, A girl was on her knees; She held aloft a snowy scarf, Which fluttered in the breeze. She breath'd a prayer for him, A prayer he could not hear, But he paused to bless her as she knelt, And wiped away a tear. III He turn'd, and left the spot, Oh! do not deem him weak, For dauntless was the soldier's heart, Tho' tears were on his cheek. Go watch the foremost ranks, In danger's dark career. Be sure the hand most daring there Has wiped away a tear. WELCOME ME HOME. I Gaily the Troubadour Touch'd his guitar, When he was hastening Home from the war. Singing “From Palestine Hither I come, Lady love! Lady love! Welcome me home.” II She for the Troubadour Hopelessly wept; Sadly she thought of him, When others slept; Singing “In search of thee Would I might roam, Troubadour! Troubadour! Come to my home.” III Hark! 'twas the Troubadour Breathing her name, Under the battlement, Softly he came, Singing “From Palestine Hither I come, Lady love! Lady love! Welcome me home.” SONGS OF THE HAMLET. THE WOUNDED YOUNG KNIGHT. I There came to the hamlet a gallant young knight, He had lost his good steed, he was wounded in fight; And torn was his banner, and broken his lance, His features were bloodless, dejected his glance; A cottager found him and pitied his plight, And offer'd a home to the wounded young knight. II Oh! boldly youth's vigour may struggle with pain, The banish'd rose bloom'd on his features again, His eyes regain'd lustre, and fondly they smil'd On the nurse of his sickness, the cottager's child. And she never strove to conceal her delight, As she rov'd by the side of the wounded young knight. III His war steed is found, and the soldier is gone. Her cheek is as pallid as once was his own; Her step is as feeble, her eyes are as dim, He cheers not the maid, once so cheering to him: He shines at the tourney, he triumphs in fight, She in death breathes a pray'r for the wounded young knight. THE DARK-EYED BRUNETTE. I Remember, at Florence, the dark-eyed Brunette, With her song, and guitar, and her ringlets of jet, How she danc'd to the measure of Italy's lay, And changing it ever, now pensive, now gay. Oh! rove where you will, you must never forget The Florentine beauty, the dark-eyed Brunette. II When I build my love-bower I'll build it at home. From England's fair daughters I wish not to roam; For all that I've seen far away o'er the sea Endears the pure rose of my country to me. Yet still, t'were ingratitude, quite to forget The Florentine beauty, the dark-eyed Brunette. I LOVE THE VILLAGE CHURCH. I I love the village church, With its ivy mantled towers; And rustic forms around the porch, At the Sabbath's holy hour; The music of the bell, O'er the pleasant valley stealing; And the simple pray'r that breathes so well The pure heart's fervent feeling. II I love the village green, Where, after hours of labour, At eve, the young and old are seen With merry pipe and tabor. The banquet is not spread As it is in courtly places; But Nature o'er the spot has shed Her own peculiar graces. THE HAPPY VALLEY. I Oh! after many roving years, how sweet it is to come To the dwelling place of early youth, our first, our dearest home. To turn away our weary eyes from proud ambition's towers; And wander in the summer fields, among the trees and flowers. Oh, after many roving years, &amp;c. II But I am chang'd since last I gaz'd on yonder tranquil scene, And sat beneath the old witch elm that shades the village green, And watch'd my boat upon the brook, as 'twere a regal galley, And sigh'd not for a joy on earth, beyond the happy valley. Oh, after many roving years, &amp;c. III I wish I could recall again that bright and blameless joy, And summon to my weary heart the feelings of a boy. But I look on scenes of past delight, without my wonted pleasure, As a miser on the bed of death looks coldly on his treasure. Yet after many roving years, &amp;c YOUR LOT IS FAR ABOVE ME. I Your lot is far above me, I dare not be your bride; To know that you have lov'd me Will wound your father's pride. Go, woo some high-born lady, And he will bless your choice. Alas! too long already, I've listen'd to your voice. II Oh! may your grief be fleeting! Go seek the halls of mirth, Dread not a future meeting, We ne'er shall meet on earth. Though o'er love's passing vision These tears of anguish flow, Doubt not the stern decision Of her who bids you go. III These tears are not intended As lures to make you stay: I wish they were not blended With all you hear me say. Go! would you ne'er had sought me 'Tis hard so young to die; But 'twas your kindness taught me To raise my hopes so high. IT IS THE LAST MEETING. I It is the last meeting, I know it too well; And near you to-morrow no more I shall dwell Those sweet days are gone! 'Twas folly, I know, I once would not let myself think they could go. At night, when one day of enjoyment was past, I could look to another as bright as the last. My fate is decided, alone I shall dwell, It is the last meeting, receive my farewell. II I blame not your going, the error was mine: I suffered Love's fetters around me to twine; At first they are feeble, and little we think How soon Time will strengthen each delicate link. I ought to have known that my wishes were vain, That the world would recall its young truant again. My fate is decided, alone I shall dwell, It is the last meeting, receive my farewell. SONGS FROM FAIRY LAND. THE MAGICAL MIRROR. I “Why wed you not, baron,” once whispered a fairy, “There's gold in your coffers, why wed you not now?” “Not yet,” quoth the baron, “'tis best to be wary, I might make a change for the worse, you'll allow. My temper's a jealous one; beauty would keep My mind in a frenzy. I'll look 'ere I leap.” II “Oh! give me a boon,” cried the baron, “pray give me, A magical mirror of crystal and gold, And in it if womankind e'er should deceive me, The cause of her fickleness let me behold.” “'Tis yours,” said the fairy; “whatever may be The cause of your grief, there that cause you shall see.” III The Baron soon married, soon found out his error. He sighed in his castle, a desolate place. He eagerly sought in the magical mirror The cause of the evil, and saw—his own face. When age finds a blank in the lot that he draws, He need raise no fairy to tell him the cause. IS THE REIGN OF FANCY OVER? I Is the reign of fancy over With her little fairy train? Shall the night no more be peopled With the visions of the brain? When the moon is bright above us, Shall we dare to venture forth, As if there were no spirits In the air and on the earth? When we hear soft strains of music, Shall we doubt that silver strings Have been touch'd by sprites who revel When the dew is on their wings? When we see the mystic circle On the meadow's green expanse, Shall we doubt we see the footmarks Of the elves' unearthly dance? II No; romance will lose her power, And the muse forget her skill, If we say those wild responses Are mere echoes from the hill; If we say no fairy revels Leave their shadows on the heath, We shall blight the sweetest blossoms That 're bloomed in fancy's wreath. Oh! we must not drive the fairies From their summer haunts on earth; Oh! we must not spurn the legends Of their mischief and their mirth; Oh! we must not rob the blue-bells Of the beings who resort To their silken cells for shelter, Till Titania holds her court. SWEET SISTER FAY. I “Oh! where have you been, sweet sister Fay?” “I have slept in a lily-bell all the long day, And many an insect came to look For the honey that lay in the fragrant nook. I was arm'd with a spear from the hawthorn spray, And afraid of its point they all fluttered away; So I sung my own lullaby, sleeping at ease, In the bell of a lily that wav'd in the breeze. The day is for labour, the night is for glee; Come, brother, trip lightly with me.” Come, sister, trip lightly with me.” II “Where are you going, sweet sister Fay?” “To the turf that is greenest, I'm tripping away; Hark! hark! the sweet music of midnight I hear; The holly leaves rustle, we've startled a deer; The rivulets gushing through coral caves, At intervals drip in the dark blue waves; I've jewell'd my hair, and I've spangled my wing, For I am going to dance at the court of my king. The day is for labour, the night is for glee; Come, brother, trip lightly with me.” Come, sister, trip lightly with me.” ONCE A SILLY MAID. I Once a silly maid exclaimed, “Children wail and fools grow pale, Whene'er a fairy sprite is nam'd, In song or gossip tale. But I laugh at fairy-land, On its limits let me stand, I'll make fun of Oberon, And break his pigmy wand.” II Cried a friend, “Thou'rt brave by day, But at night perhaps I might Chace thy unbelief away, And scare thee with a sprite. Wilt thou, when the clock strikes one, Seek the fairy glen alone?” “Yes; agreed, I'll do the deed, And laugh when it is done.” III To the fairy glen she went, Half afraid to turn her head. Secretly she did repent The bargain she had made. Ev'ry leaf that chanc'd to stir Seem'd to be a sprite to her, Bat or owl, or the howl Of the village cur. IV Home she hurried, half asham'd; What occur'd was never heard, But when fairy-land is nam'd, She never says a word. Some indeed presume to say, She met a husband young and gay; Not a sprite; yet her heart that night Was spirited away. THE INVISIBLE ELVES. I The wee Heinzelmanchens were elves of repute, They watch'd o'er each housewife's domestic pursuit; The ovens were heated, the chambers were swept By her pigmy assistants, while soundly she slept; The proof of their industry shone on her shelves, Yet none had e'er seen these invisible elves. II Dame Bridget, whose spouse was a baker by trade, Ow'd much to the sprite's supernatural aid. But curious women, like children, will break A toy to discover the trick of its make. “No mortal has seen them,” said she to herself, “What can they be made of? I must catch an Elf.” III All night she sat watching, but not a mouse stirr'd: All night too she listen'd, but nothing was heard: They never came near her; she weeps and she prays; But she toils for herself all the rest of her days. She paid for her peeping, a common mishap: Curiosity caught in her own little trap. YOUNG BRINCAN, BEWARE! I Beware of the fairy! young Brincan beware! Thy cheeks are like roses, and bright is thy hair; Thy beauty hath charm'd her, beware of her spell; She is calling thee down to her bright coral cell. Look not in the water, for danger is there. Row homeward, row homeward! young Brincan, beware! II Her spell is upon him; like one who would leap To the arms of a mistress, he dives in the deep; Sweet harmonies hail him, he seems to repose On an emerald pillow as downward he goes: A fairy receives him—oh! what is so fair As that beautiful being! Young Brincan beware! III Her hair is sea-green, but he heeds not its hue, When he looks on her eyes of etherial blue. He loves the fair sea-nymph, forgetting the worth Of his own betroth'd maiden, the fairest on earth. 'Tis morn, and he leaves her, his boat is still there; Row homeward, row homeward! Young Brincan, beware! IV The spell is dissolved; as he steps on the shore, He seeks his betroth'd—but she loves him no more! “Thy hair,” she exclaimed, “is as green as the sea, And a web-footed man is no lover for me.” 'Tis thus with the fickle, who fond vows forswear, For Fairy or Woman! so lovers beware! THE NURSERY TALE. I Oh! did you not hear, in your nursery, The tale that the gossips tell, Of the two young girls who came to drink, At a certain fairy well? The words of the youngest were as sweet As the smile on her ruby lip; But the tongue of the eldest seemed to move As if venom were on its tip! II At the well a beggar accosted them, (A sprite in a mean disguise.) The eldest spoke with a scornful brow, The youngest with tearful eyes. Cried the fairy, “Whenever you speak, sweet girl, Pure gems from your lips shall fall; But whenever you utter a word, proud maid, From your tongue shall a serpent crawl.” III And have you not met these sisters oft, In the haunts of the old and young, The first with her pure and unsullied lip, The last with her serpent tongue? Yes! the first is Goodnature; diamonds bright On the darkest theme she throws; And the last is Slander, leaving the slime Of the snake where'er she goes. THE PERI AND THE PAGE. I A Peri, o'ercome by a Deev, was left In a golden cage confin'd; On the topmost branch of the loftiest tree, It rock'd in the stormy wind. A Page through the forest was prancing forth, But he paus'd, when the Peri cried, “Oh! give me liberty, gentle youth, And I'll be thy lady bride.” II “Nay, I have a love of my own,” he said, “A maiden of low degree; I'll let thee loose; but, beauteous sprite, Thou art not the bride for me.” “I'll give thee the wealth of the world,” she cried. “No, the wealth of the world were vain; Yet tho' I can never be thine, fair sprite, I will break thy golden chain.” III He climb'd the tree, and the Peri was free; But ere she her thanks could speak, With joyous speed, he mounted his steed, The home of his love to seek. “Oh! dearer to me is thy constancy, Than thy love could have been,” she cried; “I promise thee health, I promise thee wealth, Then away to thy chosen bride.” I'VE FAIRY GIFTS ROUND ME. I I've fairy gifts round me, to win back a lover, Who flies from the fond one, still faithful to him. I know I am chang'd, but these spells will recover The heart that is sad and the eye that is dim. Oh! if I was pale when he last looked upon me, My tears in his absence had banished my bloom; Yet would I had smil'd, for I fear he will shun me, His gay spirit shrinks from reproaches and gloom. II But never again shall he see me dejected, My grief when he frowns shall lie deep in my breast; I'll bathe my hot brow with the dews I've collected From rings on the meadows by fairy feet prest; My hair I'll adorn with each delicate flower That buds in the moonlight, for legends will prove When man is inconstant, such wreaths have the power To bring back the beauty that first won his love. FAIRY FAVOURS. I I have dreamt of fairy favours, Of the gold that lies conceal'd, Where no outward mark betrays it In the poor man's sterile field. Is not Industry the fairy, Who can call those favours forth, And can raise a golden harvest From the bosom of the earth? II I have dreamt of fairy favours, Of the spell that will secure True love thro' all its trials, Still as holy and as pure: Is not Constancy the fairy? Is not Innocence her spell? Yes, a paradise she raises, Where true love delights to dwell. III I have dreamt of fairy favours, Of a home of perfect bliss; No monarch has a palace Half so beautiful as this! And is not Content the fairy Who beholds the map unfurl'd; And points to her own dwelling As the best in all the world? THE SPECTRE-LIKE TREE. I Under the spectre-like yew, Spreading its boughs o'er the heath, Sat the lone Banshee; I knew Her wail was the herald of death! 'Twas not a summons for me— When she wept under the spectre-like tree. II Wildly my lover I sought, Scar'd by that desolate wail. Smiling he came—yet I thought Ne'er had I seen him so pale; Oh! how it shock'd me to see, Why she wept under the spectre-like tree! III Now he is laid on his bier, Far from all sorrow and pain, And it would please me to hear The voice of the Banshee again. Come with a summons to me, Come to weep under the spectre-like tree! IS NOT THIS A HAUNTED GROVE? I. “Is not this a haunted grove? Are not fairies round me playing? Hear a maid who seeks her love; Tell me whither is he straying!” “Is he straying!” “Mock me not, but prythee tell, Is there still some kindness in him? Show me by some fairy spell, How to woo him, how to win him!” “How to win him!” II. “Tell me then the truth at once: Tell me am I doom'd to doubt him; Give, oh! give some kind response, For I cannot live without him!” “Live without him!” Mary thus her lot bewails, Still invokes some sylph or fairy. Ye who laugh at fairy tales, Much I fear you'll laugh at Mary. Laugh at Mary. III. She had faith in pigmy sprites; And when'er she miss'd her lover, Sallied forth in moonlight nights, Calling them to catch the rover. Catch the rover. At her elbow, he ere long, Gently whispers something soothing; Mary's sorrow, like my song, Both begins and ends in nothing. Ends in nothing. SONGS OF THE SEASONS. SONGS FOR SPRING MORNINGS. I. THOUGH THE SUMMER MAY HAVE ROSES. Tho' the summer may have roses That outshine the buds of Spring, Deeper shadows in the forest, Blither birds upon the wing. When I see a bright Spring morning, After long, long days of gloom, Summer seems to sport around me In his infancy of bloom. Oh! 'tis sad to see the splendour Of the summer pass away, When the night is always stealing Precious moments from the day: But in Spring each lengthened evening Tempts us farther off from home, And if summer has more beauty, All that beauty is to come. It is thus in manhood's summer, That the heart too often grieves, Over friends lost prematurely, Like the fall of blighted leaves; But, life's spring-time is far sweeter, When each green bud that appears May expand into a blossom, To enliven future years. II. FASHION AND NATURE. Cried Fashion once, that idle queen, “The Spring I love, the balmy Spring! When trees put on their palest green, And feather'd songsters learn to sing!” Dame Nature heard her, and replied “If thus you speak, our quarrel ends, Henceforth we'll wander side by side, Fashion and Nature now are friends.” So Fashion chose a flowing gown, Her flimsy fancies to conceal; And simple Nature went to town To visit Fashion en famille. She sought her in the gay saloon, Where she had revelled all the night: But Fashion did not rise at noon, Her rouge looks best at candlelight. Nature found nothing to her taste; She pined with Fashion by her side; Her own flowers in vases placed, Like birds in cages, drooped and died. To save her life she ran away, And Fashion did not much regret Her simple guest;—so since that day Fashion and Nature have not met. III. FAIREST! WE HAIL THEE QUEEN OF THE MAY! Queen of the May! how sweet is thy throne! Nature herself hath lent thee her own. Covet not gold and jewels of state; Heed not their lustre; think of their weight! Light are thy crown and regal array: Fairest! we hail thee Queen of the May! Queen of the May how gay is thy court, Light-hearted beings thither resort; Covet not halls that sparkle by night, False are their garlands, false is their light! Sunshine illumes thy festival day; Fairest! we hail thee Queen of the May! IV. COME OVER THE LAKE, LOVE! Come over the lake, Love! come over the lake; In yonder green island the Elves are awake, Our bugles they'll hear—and their haunts they'll forsake: Oh! blow the horn! oh! blow the horn! Hark! fairies are replying! Nay, laugh not at fairies, a dangerous jest; They sport in these valleys when we are at rest; I'll call them—you'll hear them—let this be the test: Oh! blow the horn!—oh! blow the horn! Hark! fairies are replying! You say 'tis an echo—perhaps you can tell What echoes are made of, and shew where they dwell? If not—why my fairies at least do as well! Oh! blow the horn!—oh! blow the horn! Hark! fairies are replying! V. ALAS! YOUTH'S GAY SPRING MOMENTS PASS. Alas! Youth's gay Spring moments pass Like sand through old Time's glass; Where pleasure throws Her sweetest rose, To morrow comes a grief, To spread the yellow leaf! The fairest things Have fleetest wings! What then!—gay hearts to-night May catch them in their flight. Heigho! How soon the step of woe Mars beauty's sunlit snow! E'en smiles are made Old Time to aid, For do not wrinkles tell Where dimples used to dwell? The fairest things Have fleetest wings; What then!—gay hearts to-night May catch them in their flight. VI. THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR. Spring flowers are no longer What spring flowers used to be; Their fragrance and their beauty Cannot give delight to me: The cowslip and the primrose And the violet are here— Ah! why am I dejected In the Spring time of the year? How well do I remember When I chased dull sleep away, To give an early welcome To the merry month of May! My footstep on the meadow Was the first to rouse the deer, Ah! then I hailed each blossom In the Spring time of the year! All seasons are delightful In life's gay unclouded spring, We sport among the flowers Like wild birds upon the wing: But when life's bloom is over, And no friendly smile is near, Oh! dreary as December Is the Spring time of the year! VII. UP! MARCH AWAY! Shall the warrior rest, when so near him The flag of the foe is unfurled? No! the sweets of repose shall not cheer him, 'Till that flag from its station be hurled. His night-cloak round him folding, He will watch the dawn of day, And the first sun's beam beholding, He will cry—“Up! March away!” In the night as his watch-path he paces, He pauses and leans on his spear, And he thinks of kind friends and loved places, 'Till down his pale cheek steals a tear! Awhile with deep devotion, For the absent he will pray; But how transient his emotion, Hark! he cries—“Up! March away!” VIII. THE FORWARD SPRING. Spring once was impatient of schooling and nursing, And grew very fine for a season so young; Her playthings she scorned, artificially forcing The charms of her person, the wit of her tongue. Her snowdrops neglecting, her roses displaying, And singing as summer birds only should sing; She smiled, and the world her attractions surveying, Declared it had ne'er seen so forward a Spring! But soon this same world, which is never unwilling To lower pretensions it sanctioned in haste, Perceived that her mornings and evenings were chilling, And all her forced fruit was found wanting in taste. “Alas!” cried the young year, “the charms that I boasted If lavished too early, too early decay, I've lost the pure pleasure of Spring, and exhausted The green leaves that might have made Summer look gay.” And now I will venture to look for a moral, In this little song, which so simple appears; Go childhood and play with your bells and your coral, And sigh not for pleasures unfit for your years: Though infancy, tutored by art prematurely, May imitate man in look, action, and tone; Life's Summer will not be forestall'd, and, too surely, The charm of life's Spring-time for ever is gone! SONGS FOR SUMMER DAYS. I. EACH SEASON POSSESSES A PLEASURE FOR ME. Each season possesses a pleasure for me, I mark not time's progress when gazing on thee; But if I must single out one from the rest, I think that for lovers the Summer is best. Spring mornings are pretty when zephyrs fly forth, To scatter sweet blossoms all over the earth; But Spring smiles too often with snow on her breast, So I think that for lovers the Summer is best. The Autumn is gay with the gold of her sheaves, The blush of her fruit, and the tint of her leaves; But her sun hastens daily more soon to the west, So I think that for lovers the Summer is best, The Winter is merry in festival hall, But false are the garlands that hang on his walls; And 'tis not in crowds that the heart is most blest, So I think that for lovers the Summer is best. II. THE OLDEN TIME. In the olden time, Young lovers roved in these gay bowers: And these echoes oft Have murmured vows as fond as ours. Yes, the old who gaze on us Once sported thus. Eyes were bright, Hearts were light, In the summer days when they were young. Where are all the brave Who won the laurels of those days? Where are all the fair, And poets, too, who sang their praise? Oh! the harp—the smile—the plume— Lie in the tomb. Some remain Who, in vain, Mourn the Summer days when they were young. III. SEE THE SUMMER LEAVES ARE COMING. See the Summer leaves are coming On the plants and on the trees, And the birds that have been roaming Under brighter skies than these. Breezes breathe so soft, they only Curl the surface of the sea; But my heart feels sad and lonely, Without thee, love! without thee. Come, and I will weave you bowers, Cool and shady all day long. Ev'ry path is full of flowers, Every grove is full of song. Sunny, when we roved together, E'en the winter seemed to me; And how sad is summer weather, Without thee, love! without thee. IV. THE OLD OAK TREE. The old oak tree our shade shall be, And there you shall sing gay songs to me; Each sparkling glass that we fill to-night, Reflecting a smile, shall beam more bright; And we'll drink to those that we fain would see Under the shade of the old oak tree. Come Fashion and see our canopy! The gay green leaves of the old oak tree. The setting sun, and the rising moon, Together shall light our sweet saloon. We've the song of the bird and the hum of the bee, Under the shade of the old oak tree. Oh, let there not be a fire for me Kindled against the old oak tree! Too many, alas! will wound the stem Of the tree that in kindness sheltered them. No brand shall be lighted for you or for me Under the shade of the old oak tree. V. COME TO ME, LOVE, AND TELL ME ALL THAT GRIEVES THEE. Come to me, love, and tell me all that grieves thee, Come to me, love, more welcome than the gay; Thy smiles were mine, and now that pleasure leaves thee, Mine be the task to wipe thy tears away. See yon fair rose,—how many triflers woo it, When morning sheds her sunshine and perfume; But like the bird that sings at midnight to it, I'll be thy guard, dear love, in hours of gloom. VI. I'D BE YOUR SHADOW. I'd be your shadow, my own dear love! Your steps I'd follow where'er you rove: Then I'd resemble the form you wear— How cold a copy of one so fair! But I'd not leave you when joy is gone, Though there's no shadow when there's no sun. I'd be your echo, my own dear love! Unseen I'd follow where'er you rove. Each word you utter, I would repeat, How vain to rival a voice so sweet! But I'd be with you when dark days come, Though faithless echo in storms is dumb. VII. OH! WHEN THE TIDE WAS OUT. Oh when the tide was out last night, In yonder bay we roved, We gathered shells, and on the sand We wrote the names we loved. And now we wander forth, and find No friendly records there. The morning tide effaced the words We traced with so much care. 'Tis thus with all whose glory rests Upon the sands of earth; As vain is all the pomps of pride, As vain the smiles of mirth. The ceaseless tide at intervals Will rush o'er all the scene; 'Twill pass—and not a record then Will tell where they have been! VIII. DEAREST INFANT, PURE AS FAIR. Dearest infant, pure as fair, Whilst I watch thy closing eye, Thus my babe, thy mother's pray'r Mingles with her lullaby: Oh be content And innocent! When thy lip's uncertain sound Ripens into words at length; When thy foot upon the ground, Steps relying on its strength: Oh be content And innocent! When the tempting world shall come With the garland that she waves, Some without a thorn, but some Hiding poison in their leaves: Oh be content And innocent! SONGS FOR AUTUMN EVENINGS. I. NOT A SUMMER FRIEND WOULD STAY. My garden once displayed Each fair leaf'd summer flow'r, And fragrant tendrils made A curtain for my bow'r. They are gone! they are gone! It will never more be gay; When I lost the bright sun, Not a summer bud would stay! My garden has been full Of friends in former hours, Who gaily came to cull The fairest of my flow'rs. They are gone! they are gone! It will never more be gay, When I lost the bright sun, Not a summer friend would stay! II. HARVEST HOME! The last golden sheaf is borne off from the meadow, The reaper is gone for his labour is done; The harvest that grew where no cloud threw its shadow Was gathered to-day in the smiles of the sun. See! see! the tankard's foam! Hark! hark! 'tis harvest home! Youth trips to the sound of the pipe and the tabor, While innocent childhood looks on with his laugh, And happy old age tells some listening neighbour Of festivals past, as he leans on his staff. See! see! the tankard's foam! Hark! hark! 'tis harvest home! III. THOUGH AT EACH STEP WE PRESS SOME WITHERED LEAF. Though at each step we press some withered leaf, Like a young joy, by time, turned to a grief. Though all is dreary now, never forget We may find sunshine and summer leaves yet! Winter will yield up his sceptre to May; She will weep o'er it and throw it away; June will soon follow, his sunny hair drest With the gay coronet summer loves best. Oh! 'twill be thus with this sad time of ours: May comes with weeping, but June comes with flow'rs; Trees that around us seem withering now Soon will wear blossoms on every bough. IV. WAKE, DEAREST LOVE! THE MOON IS BRIGHT. Wake, dearest love! the moon is bright; Dream not away so sweet a night; When clouds come on, repose at ease, But do not waste nights fair as these: The very birds are all awake! The swan is roused and skims the lake! The world's so bright, the summer bee Believes 'tis noon!—then come to me! Oh! 'tis the time for serenades! When the moon peeps thro' orange shades, Guitars and voices gain a tone Of sweet enchantment, not their own! There's a wild cadence in the breeze! A murmur in the trembling trees! The silver ripple of the sea Has music in it!—come to me! And few such nights are left us now: The yellow tint is on the bough; The farewell whisper summer gives Just curls the lake, just fans the leaves. Too soon will wane the harvest moon, The latest rose will fade too soon; But in my heart there still will be A summer—if you'll come to me. V. SEE THE MONARCHS OF THE FOREST. See the monarchs of the forest Lose their summer beauty now, And the yellow tints of autumn Mingle on each waving bough. Though these colours are more varied Than their former green array, Yet I love them not—they tell me That all fair things pass away. Oh! I love the spring time better, With her buds that promise bloom, For she daily gives some token That a summer soon will come. And when she comes, I love her, With her sunshine fair and gay, But the winds of autumn tell me That all fair things pass away. VI. TAKE AGAIN ALL YOU GAVE. Take again all you gave as the proofs of your love, Take them back for their value is gone; They were dear to me once, but with others you rove, I am left to weep o'er them alone. Since the heart you gave with them no longer is mine, Since my tears and entreaties are vain, Fare thee well! each remembrance I proudly resign, They are worthless—receive them again. Take the harp so long used to the songs of your choice When your taste was content with my skill; Take it back, since you now find no charm in my voice, Though I sing your old favourites still. Take the garlands you sportively taught me to twine, Take the steed that you led by its rein; Fare thee well! each remembrance I proudly resign, They are worthless—receive them again. VII. ON THE HILLS I WANDERED EARLY. On the hills I wandered early, And I met a maiden there, Who was twining wild flowers With the tresses of her hair. And I thought when I beheld her In her simple garb array'd, This is one of Nature's blossoms, Form'd for solitude and shade. To the dance I went at midnight, And I saw a maiden there, With a diadem of jewels Round the tresses of her hair. It was she I met so early, But her simple garb was gone, And she now seemed formed to revel In the sunshine of a throne. Oh! when youth and beauty mingle In the mansions of the gay, Let not the old condemn them, Or turn scornfully away. For in truth there may be many Who, like my fair mountain maid, Keep their brightness for the sunshine, And their virtues for the shade. VIII. TEACH ME TO FORGET! Friends depart, and memory takes them To her caverns pure and deep; And a forced smile only wakes them From the shadows where they sleep. Who shall school the heart's affection? Who will banish its regret? If you blame my deep dejection— Teach, oh! teach me to forget! Bear me not to festive bowers, 'Twas with them I sat there last! Weave me not Spring's early flowers, They'll remind me of the past! Music seems like mournful wailing, In the halls where we have met; Mirth's gay call is unavailing— Teach, oh! teach me to forget! One who hopelessly remembers Cannot bear a dawning light; He would rather watch the embers Of a love that once was bright. Who shall school the heart's affection? Who shall banish its regret? If you blame my deep dejection— Teach, oh! teach me to forget! SONGS FOR WINTER NIGHTS. I. SIGH NOT FOR SUMMER FLOWERS. Sigh not for summer flowers; What, though the dark sky lowers, Welcome ye wintry hours! Our sunshine is within. Though to the west retreating, Daylight so soon is fleeting, Now happy friends are meeting, And now their sports begin. Sigh not for summer flowers. Leaves that our path once shaded Now lie around us faded; Groves where we serenaded Are desolate and chill; Nature awhile reposes, Art his gay realm uncloses, Beauty displays her roses, And we are happy still! Sigh not for summer flowers. Round us 'tis deeply snowing; Hark! the loud tempest blowing; See! the dark torrent flowing; How wild the skies appear! But can the whirlwind move us? No! with this roof above us, Near to the friends that love us, We still have sunshine here. Sigh not for summer flowers. II. THE DARK WINTER TIME. A goblet with gems may be shining, Though bitter the poison within; So gay wreaths are often entwining The lure that entices to sin. Oh! turn from the false tongues that flatter, They cannot ennoble a crime. Oh! think of the thorns they would scatter O'er thy path, in the dark winter time. The home of thy youth may be lonely, The friends of thy youth may be cold; The morals they teach may seem only Fit chains for the feeble and old. Yet, though they may fetter a spirit That soars in the pride of its prime; The friends of thy infancy merit All thy love in the dark winter time. The stranger in gems would array thee: More pure are the braids thou hast worn; Say—would not their lustre betray thee, Attracting the finger of scorn? Go—gaze once again on thy dwelling, The porch where the wild flowers climb; Go, pray while thy young heart is swelling, Pray for peace in the dark winter time! III. HO! HELM A-LEE. Ho! helm a-lee! now homeward steer, There'll be a storm to-night; But never fear, the shore is near, I see the beacon light. The white foam dances on the sea, More dark and dark it grows! Ho! helm a-lee! Ho! helm a-lee! About—about she goes! Another tack! and now again We scud across the bay; The sea-birds strain their wings in vain To pass us on the way. And now our mountain home we see, How bright the taper glows! Ho! helm a-lee! Ho! helm a-lee! About—about she goes! IV. EVERGREEN TREE. I love thee, evergreen tree! Thou art what friendship should be; But friendship oft is as brief As the rose's delicate leaf. In winter, brambles will show Where summer's fair blossoms grow; And sorrow too often turns Love's roses into love's thorns! Oh, Winter! dearly I love Thy own dark evergreen grove; Thy laurel the warrior wears, It twines round the banner he bears: Thy cypress deepens the gloom That shades a conqueror's tomb; Thy holly wreathed on the wall, At Christmas, is dearer than all. V. ARE THERE TIDINGS IN YON VESSEL. Are there tidings in yon vessel Proudly bounding o'er the wave? Are there tidings for a mother Who is mourning for the brave? No, no, no! She is freighted with fond tidings, But no tidings from the grave. Do not ask me why I hasten To each vessel that appears; Why I seem to cling so wildly To one cherished hope for years; No, no, no! Though my search proves unvailing, What have I to do with tears? Do not blame me when I seek him, With these wan and weary eyes; Can you tell me where he perished? Can you shew me where he lies? No, no, no! Yet there surely is some record, When a brave young hero dies. Had I watched beside his pillow, Had I seen him on his bier; Oh! I must have died of weeping, But I cannot shed a tear! No, no, no! Let me still think I shall see him, Let me still think he is near. VI. OH! WHERE DO FAIRIES HIDE THEIR HEADS. Oh! where do fairies hide their heads, When snow lies on the hills; When frost has spoiled their mossy beds, And chrystalized their rills? Beneath the moon they cannot trip In circles o'er the plain; And draughts of dew they cannot sip, Till green leaves come again. Perhaps, in small blue diving bells, They plunge beneath the wave; Inhabiting the wreathed shells That lie in coral caves. Perhaps, in red Vesuvius, Carousals they maintain; And cheer their little spirits thus, Till green leaves come again. When they return, there will be mirth, And music in the air; And fairy wings upon the earth, And mischief everywhere. The maids, to keep the elves aloof, Will bar the doors in vain; No key-hole will be fairy-proof, When green leaves come again. VII. A WINTER'S NIGHT. In fragrant Spring, the flowers of May Throw all their sheltering folds away; Reviving Nature waves her wand, On every tree the leaves expand; But mine be the hearth that blazes bright, And a circle of friends on a winter's night. In Summer time, each little stem Is deck'd with its leafy diadem; Each rose holds fast, with a fond caress, A captive bee in its sweet recess. But mine be the hearth that blazes bright, And a circle of friends on a winter's night. VIII. THE MISLETOE BOUGH. ?The happiest of the happy, When a spring-lock, that lay in ambush there, Fasten'd her down for ever. Rogers. The misletoe hung in the castle hall, The holly branch shone on the old oak wall; And the baron's retainers were blithe and gay, And keeping their Christmas holiday. The baron beheld, with a father's pride; His beautiful child, young Lovell's bride; While she, with her bright eyes, seem'd to be The star of the goodly company. “I'm weary of dancing now;” she cried; “Here tarry a moment—I'll hide—I'll hide! “And, Lovell, be sure thou'rt first to trace “The clue to my secret lurking place.” Away she ran—and her friends began Each tower to search, and each nook to scan; And young Lovell cried, “Oh! where dost thou hide? “I'm lonesome without thee, my own dear bride.” They sought her that night! and they sought her next day! And they sought her in vain, when a week pass'd away! In the highest—the lowest—the loneliest spot, Young Lovell sought wildly—but found her not. And years flew by, and their grief at last Was told as a sorrowful tale long past; And when Lovell appear'd the children cried, “See! the old man weeps for his fairy bride.” At length an oak chest, that had long lain hid Was found in the castle—they raised the lid— And a skeleton form lay mouldering there, In the bridal wreath of that lady fair! Oh! sad was her fate!—in sportive jest She hid from her lord in the old oak chest. It closed with a spring!—and, dreadful doom, The bride lay clasp'd in her living tomb! SONGS OF THE BOUDOIR. WE MET. I We met—'twas in a crowd—and I thought he would shun me; He came—I could not breathe, for his eye was upon me; He spoke—his words were cold, and his smile was unalter'd; I knew how much he felt, for his deep-toned voice falter'd. I wore my bridal robe, and I rivall'd its whiteness. Bright gems were in my hair, how I hated their brightness; He called me by my name, as the bride of another— Oh, thou hast been the cause of this anguish, my mother! II And once again we met, and a fair girl was near him: He smiled, and whispered low—as I once used to hear him. She leant upon his arm—once 'twas mine, and mine only— I wept, for I deserved to feel wretched and lonely. And she will be his bride! at the altar he'll give her The love that was too pure for a heartless deceiver. The world may think me gay, for my feelings I smother; Oh, thou hast been the cause of this anguish, my mother! THE BOARD IS FULL. I The board is full, we look upon No vacant chair to-night; Though years have passed since last we met, For once we'll scorn their flight. We'll laugh, and be as light of heart As if old time stood still, Between our cheerless parting cup, And that which now we fill. II The call is vain! I miss the smile That made the wine cup sweet; When friends are parted, who shall say, Thus smilingly we'll meet? What trace we in the retrospect Of years, however brief? The fading of the summer flower! The falling of the leaf! SAY YOU'LL REMEMBER. I When we part, I fain would believe Thou wilt remember how happy we've been, But can man have leisure to grieve, Finding new pleasures in ev'ry new scene? Say, you'll remember! II When we part, thy varied career Cannot but ween thy affections at last; I shall mourn, for I shall dwell here, Where all must waken sad thoughts of the past. Say, you'll remember! GIVE ME GOLD. I Give me gold, if hoarded treasure Is the price of life's pleasure; But if bliss is ne'er sold, Why should I ask for gold? II Give me state, if those who number Fawning slaves calmly slumber; But if slaves fawn, yet hate, Why should I ask for state? III If bright gems bring darksome hours, Oh give me fields and flowers; Pride my choice may condemn, But content asks no gem. SIGH NOT. I Sigh not, when I'm away, Fly not far from the gay; Buy not sorrow's dull tale, Cry not,—will it avail? Why not pleasure partake? Die not—live for my sake, Sigh not, when I'm away, Fly not far from the gay. II Hie not to the weird sage, Pry not into life's page, Try not witchery's test; Why not hope for the best? I, not dreaming of guile, Spy not a crime in a smile! Sigh not when I'm away, Fly not far from the gay. THEY WEEP WHEN I HAVE NAMED HER. I They weep when I have named her! I'm sure she was more dear To me, than all the world beside, and yet I shed no tear: I culled the freshest roses, and twined them for her hair, And then I sought her chamber—but, oh! she is not there! II They tell me I have lost her, I smile to see them mourn: She could not thus desert me, I know she will return. And I have deck'd her bower, with all my former care, And now I come to seek her—but oh! she is not there! III I saw them kneel in silence beneath a yew tree's gloom, They pointed to the name I loved upon a marble tomb! And then I wept—but something forbad me to despair, I felt that we should meet again—for oh! she is not there! COME WOO ME AND WIN ME. I Come woo me and win me, but you must be taught By love, and love only, my heart can be caught; Thy wealth will not lure me, ne'er talk of thy store, Believe me I value my happiness more. Come woo me and win me, but you must be taught By love, and love only, my heart can be caught. II I do not reject thee, I own I am free, And made to my fancy my fetters must be; Affection's light garland my heart will retain, But ne'er hope to bind it with interest's chain. Come woo me and win me, but you must be taught By love, and love only, my heart can be caught. THAT FROWN WAS HALF IN JEST. I That silly frown was half in jest, Heigho! We chide the being we love best, Heigho! And then too oft a smile is worn To win the praise of crowds we scorn; That frown was half in jest. II I thought refusals well exprest, Heigho! Were of true loves the surest test, Heigho! And so I frown'd, and bade him go, And now I'd give the world to show That frown was half in jest. OH SING ME NO NEW SONGS TO-NIGHT. I Oh, sing me no new songs to-night: Repeat the plaintive strain, My favourite air in former years,— Come sing it once again. Sweet thoughts that slumber'd start to life, And give my heart relief; And though I weep to hear that song, 'Tis not the tear of grief. II Her precious record of the past Fond memory oft conceals, But music with her master key The hidden volume steals; The loves, the friends, the hopes of youth Are stored in every leaf, Oh, if I weep to hear that song, 'Tis not the tear of grief MISCELLANEOUS SONGS. OH! AM I NOT A LOVER STILL. I Oh! am I not a lover still; In heart and soul the same, As when I sought your bower first, And learn'd to breathe your name? Oh! look I not as proud of you? Oh! speak I not as kind? And, when I leave you, do I not Leave joy itself behind? II The love I offer'd long ago Is but matured by time: As tendrils round their chosen bough Cling closer as they climb. Then am I not a lover still; In heart and soul the same, As when I sought your bower first, And learn'd to breathe your name? THE BRIDEMAID. I The bridal is over, the guests are all gone; The bride's only sister sits weeping alone: The wreath of white roses is torn from her brow, And the heart of the Bridemaid is desolate now! II With smiles and caresses she deck'd the fair bride, And then led her forth with affectionate pride: She knew that together no more they should dwell, Yet she smiled when she kissed her, and whisper'd “Farewell!’ III She would not embitter a festival day, Nor send her sweet sister in sorrow away: She hears the bells ringing; she sees her depart— She cannot veil longer the grief of her heart. IV She thinks of each pleasure, each pain, that endears The gentle companion of happier years. The wreath of white roses is torn from her brow, And the heart of the Bridemaid is desolate now! THE VACANT CHAIR. Suggested by a Monument by?in the Church at Peartree Green, near Southampton. I Thy name, thy worth, my buried love, To others shall be told, Inscribed upon a marble tomb In characters of gold. But in thy chamber I will mourn; I've dear memorials there; I'll look upon the silent lute, And yonder vacant chair. II How precious to the widow'd heart Such simple records prove! In fond perfection they restore Lost words and looks of love. They give us tears and take from pain The anguish of despair. I'll look upon the silent lute, And yonder vacant chair. 'TWAS THE LONG EXPECTED SIGNAL! I She was watching from her casement, She had watch'd since close of day, 'Twas not the hour appointed, Yet she blam'd him for delay; Her gay disguise, her mask and cloak, Were lying by her side, Impatiently she breath'd his name, And wept when none replied. And then she vow'd that he in turn Should watch and wait for her, For when she heard the signal word, She would not deign to stir. II 'Twas the long expected signal! Oh! she knew he'd come at last, She gave a ready answer, For her angry mood was past. And glancing at her toilet glass, She paused a moment there, To re-arrange her silken robe And deck her flowing hair. She gaily sang the melody That was her lover's choice, How happy was that maiden's heart, How merry was her voice! III Alas! 'twas not by her alone That signal had been heard, Her lover's rival lurking there Had caught the whisper'd word. And bloody was his dagger's point As from the scene he rush'd, And cold and pale the lover lay, The voice of love was hush'd! And all unconscious of her doom, Came forth his plighted bride. None saw her shed a tear, at morn The dead lay side by side. PLACE THE LAMP IN YOUR CASEMENT. I Place the lamp in your casement to-night, And draw the silk curtains aside; Far off I shall gaze on the light, As o'er the calm waters I glide. Yes, tranquil the ocean will be, Then prithee, love, watch not in fear, What to you may seem storm, is to me The fair breeze that is wafting me here. Then kindle your lamp, draw the curtain aside, And o'er the calm waters I'll glide. II I will let you extinguish the light, When I've anchor'd my boat in the bay, The beacon we want in our flight; Must guide us the opposite way. Yes, flight—and you will not refuse To fly to my home o'er the sea; For it would be a pity to lose A breeze that's as fair as can be. Extinguish your lamp and rely on your guide, And o'er the calm waters we'll glide. OH! TALK NO MORE OF SORROW PAST. I Oh! talk no more of sorrow past, You taint the present too, And even I shall dream at last Of future ills like you. Where'er my path, I ever took Fair hope to be my guide, Whate'er my fate, I ever look Upon the brightest side. II The darkest cloud that visits earth Not oft survives the day; I'm ever first to sally forth To meet sunbeams half way. The only long liv'd grief must be A grief that's born of sin; But virtue soon cheers up, for she Has sunny thoughts within. IT IS NO HOME FOR ME. I I cannot wish to see the home, where in my youth I dwelt, Oh, were I there, the grief I feel more keenly would be felt: Another's guest in that abode I could not bear to be; I have no right to enter there, it is no home for me. II That home perchance is still unchang'd, in me that change how great, A welcome in an unknown voice would chill me at the gate. I think I should lie down and weep, beneath my fav'rite tree. Oh no, you must not take me there, it is no home for me. III But should that home be desolate, untenanted, and wild, Then all alone I will seek out my play place when a child; When there are none my sighs to hear, and none my tears to see, I'll bid adieu to that dear home, ah! now no home for me. FLY AWAY SORROW! I What can mean this regal gift, And what can be the donor's drift? These silken folds so lightly fall, And jewels rare To deck my hair, To-night I'll wear them at the ball. Tra, la, la, tra, la, la, Oh! it is beautiful; Fly away sorrow, Why it was sent me, We'll find out to-morrow; To-night I will wear it, Oh! fly away sorrow. II It may be a bridal dress, And that is startling I confess. In wedding robes I'll not appear, Till (entre nous,) They tell me who Will act the part of bridegroom here. Tra, la, la, &amp;c. Oh! it is beautiful, &amp;c. THE BOLD BUCCANEER. I Can a pure village maid love a Rover like me, Who's pastime is battle, whose home is the sea; Will she leave the seclusion that innocence loves, The vine cover'd cottage, the meadows and groves, And choosing my daring and reckless career, Will she be the bride of the bold Buccaneer? II Oh come, my brave maiden, more gentle I'll prove Than some who more artfully whisper their love. More proudly my barque o'er the waters shall glide, When I stand on the deck with my beautiful Bride. And her delicate hand in calm weather shall steer, To a gay summer isle with her bold Buccaneer. I'VE SOUGHT HIM IN THE SILENT GROVE. I I've sought him in the silent grove, I've sought him by the sea; I've sung the air he used to love, Why comes he not to me? The carnival to-night Can give me no delight, Until I hear his voice, The partner of my choice. I've sought him in the silent grove, I've sought him by the sea; I've sung the air he used to love. Why comes he not to me? II Ah now I see him dance along, The lightest of the set; And now I hear his merry song, Guitar, and castanet. Though 'tis no easy task To trace me in my mask; True love can never doubt— At once he finds me out. To-night we seek no silent grove, Nor wander by the sea; While minstrels play the airs we love, He'll gaily dance with me. NAPLES IS EVER JOYOUS AND GAY. Naples is ever joyous and gay, Dancing and music closing the day; Come with a mask or with no mask at all Welcome you'll find at the carnival ball, Tra la la. SEE THE SAIL SPREADING. I See, see the ship sailing! Weeping and wailing, Prove unavailing, Prythee refrain. Wave, wave a hand to it, Smile as you do it, Friends as they view it Cheer up again. See, see the sail spreading, Now the deck treading, Are they not dreading Peril to come? Oh! fondly address them, With a smile bless them, Never depress them Thus with your gloom. II See, the tide flowing, Hark the breeze blowing, Both are bestowing Speed on the ship. On, onward careering, While within hearing, Words that are cheering Call to your lip. Far, far the winds move them, Mists hang above them, Now if you lov them, Now you may mourn. Yield, yield to emotion, Pray with devotion, From the vast ocean May they return! FLY AWAY PRETTY MOTH. I Fly away, pretty Moth, to the shade Of the leaf where you slumber'd all day; Be content with the moon and the stars, pretty Moth, And make use of your wings while you may. Though yon glittering light may have dazzled you quite, Though the gold of yon lamp may be gay, Many things in this world that look bright, pretty Moth, Only dazzle to lead us astray. II I have seen, pretty Moth, in the world, Some as wild as yourself and as gay, Who, bewitch'd by the sweet fascination of eyes, Flitted round them by night and by day. But tho' dreams of delight may have dazzled them quite, They at last found it dangerous play. Many things in this world that look bright, pretty Moth, Only dazzle to lead us astray. LOVE IN A COTTAGE FOR ME. I Oh, the air of a city with poor little Love I'm certain will never agree. He'll sigh for the hill and the vale and the grove; So Love in a cottage for me! He'll pine if confined to a square or a street, And look round for an ever-green tree; Then give me, oh give me a rural retreat, Oh Love in a cottage for me! II I very much fear Love loses in town In heart what he gains in esprit; And the form that he doats upon most is his own, So Love in a cottage for me! I'll rove with my Love on the path by the lake, On the sands that are wash'd by the sea; And I give up all else in the world for his sake, So Love in a cottage for me! SUMMER AND WINTER. I Oh, summer hours to us are dear, When all the bow'rs are strew'd with flow'rs, 'Tis the roving season of the year. Yes, over hill and vale we rove, By sunny rill, thro' shady grove, When all is still save the water mill; Oh! that summer time we dearly love, Oh! summer hours to us are dear, &amp;c. II And winter hours to us are dear, With leafless bowers and ceaseless show'rs, 'Tis the fireside season of the year: And songs are sung and tales are told, To charm the young, to cheer the old; And the harp is strung and the log is flung, And 'tis thus warm hearts keep out the cold. Oh! winter hours to us are dear, &amp;c. WHEN THE MOON SHINES BRIGHTLY. I Lightly, nightly, when the moon shines brightly, Wander under yon acacia boughs; There love, hear love that to me thou'rt dear, love, Fly not, why not say you'll trust my vows? If you shun me, you've undone me, With the cruel smile that won me! II Meet me, greet me, and with kind words treat me. Frown not, drown not little love in tears! Take me, make me blest, and ne'er forsake me, Treasure pleasure up for future years. I will never from thee sever, Daily loving more than ever. THOU ART THAT ONE. I He loves not like me who has lov'd more than one; If false thou could'st be, still all others I'd shun. Though broken in spirit my solace should be To think that I merit more kindness from thee. Then oh, do not say though I lov'd thee to-day, Affection will die when I'm far, far away. My eyes may see many, my heart will love none, Excepting one only, and thou art that one. II He loves not like me, when his first love is lost, Who shudders to see things she valued the most; Who shrinks from the music that she used to sing, Avoiding the garden she decked in the spring. If thou wert unkind, it would soothe me to find Some relic that call'd up the past to my mind. The tears that would flow, less than smiles would I shun, Still loving one only, and thou art that one. SAY NOT YOU LOVE ME. I Say not you love me because I am fair; Praise not my beauty, my eyes, and my hair; If these dark tresses have charm'd you to-day, What will you think of me when they grow grey? II Oh! if you love me, endeavour to find Some better reason, some charm of the mind; Though with these tresses so fondly you play, You'll seldom sport with them when they grow grey. III Love that slights beauty, in youth must be cold;— Prizing that only, what is it when old? Try to love something that will not decay; Virtue grows dearer as tresses grow grey. OH! WHY DOES HE STAY. I His foot in the stirrup, his hand on the rein, Why turns the young knight from his charger again. How lately his dark eye was kindled with rage, How lately he summon'd his little foot page. He vow'd he would ride from the castle to-day,— Now ev'ning is coming,—oh, why does he stay? II His lady love danced with another last night, He came to upbraid her, and threaten'd to fight. She laugh'd at his anger, and from her he flew, Exclaiming, “For ever, false lady, adieu!” He summon'd his charger, and brook'd not delay; And now it is waiting.—Oh, why does he stay? III Again to her chamber he silently steals, And humbly before her the penitent kneels; Again her white fingers are clasp'd in his own, Again his plume bonnet beside him is thrown. The steed and the page are forgotten to-day; The lady is smiling—the lover will stay. THE CIRCASSIAN. I She sits within the harem, the Sultan's chosen slave: She spurns the chain of jewels that proud Almanzor gave; The tyrant's haughty passion demands her love in vain, Her young heart's first affection still holds her with no chain. II She sighs for sweet Circassia, and thither fain would go; She thinks of distant fountains, and almost hears them flow; But starting from the vision, some form she seems to seek, She sees her gilded prison, and tears steal o'er her cheeks. III Her lute lies there neglected, 'twas broken by her hand, That lute, at least, shall never obey her lord's command. Her lip may give him welcome, e'en smiles at last may come, But she will never sing him one song that breathes of home. THE BOWER. I The bower, the bower! we planted together, Has felt the chill shower, and Midsummer weather; Again and again, have its blossoms been gather'd, Again and again, its leaves came and then wither'd. Oh! think with what pleasure each tendril we planted, No smiles, save the kind ones around us, were wanted; We envied not Fashion her mansions of pleasure, Nor heroes their laurel, nor misers their treasure; We sprinkled with water each choice little flower, But drank in rich wine to “The bower, the bower!” II The bower, the bower! 'tis long since we've seen it, How many meanwhile have been happy within it? Beneath its green leaves hath been many a meeting, As gay as themselves, ay, and even more fleeting. 'Tis chang'd, for each tendril spreads wildly above us; But Time has not chang'd those who then vow'd to love us; Or if chang'd, 'tis to be more sincere than we thought them, For Time the true value of friendship has taught them. We sprinkled with water each choice little flower, But drank in rich wine to “The bower, the bower!” WE HAVE LOVED. I We have loved, when some despairing Would have spurned the hopeless vow: But we still each trial sharing Sought for Hope, and find her now. II We have known the pain of hiding Love beneath a careless brow; But tho' sad, we still confiding Sought for Hope, and find her now. THOSE HAPPY DAYS. I Those happy days! Oh, let us strive To throw as sweet a charm o'er these; And ere we part, once more revive The sports that never fail to please. II Light up again the marble hall, And let the hearth more brightly blaze; Each well remember'd smile recall, And, oh! restore those happy days! III Those happy days! will they return? The hearth is bright, the wreaths are fair, The golden lamps around us burn, Yet something still is wanting there. IV Where are the smiles? On lip, and cheek, And hollow eye no smile we raise, The friends of youth in vain we seek, Nought can restore those happy days! I'LL COME AGAIN TO THEE. I I am but a lowly page, And serve a noble knight, He knows not that I envy him, In tournament or fight; For he can win the victor's prize That ladies love to see. Were I a knight I'd win it too, And come again to thee! II When foes are near, I will not leave My noble master's side. For well I know that thou wouldst scorn To be a coward's bride. The day of triumph soon will come, Oh, then I shall be free; And if I gain one laurel leaf, I'll come again to thee! III When last we met I did not dare Of love and hope to speak; And yet I saw a tear steal o'er The blush upon thy cheek, Should'st thou forget me, once again That dear face I will see, Ay, though I bear a broken heart, I'll come again to thee! I'VE THE KINDEST OF WELCOMES FOR THEE. I Oh, the kindest of welcomes I'll give thee! Then come to my dwelling, though humble it be; Should'st thou ever feel lonely, and sigh for a home, I've the kindest of welcomes for thee. We will close round the hearth with the song and the jest, When we hear the wind moan o'er the sea; Then come! while my cottage can shelter a guest, I've the kindest of welcomes for thee. II I will never complain, if the smiles of the gay In prosperity lure thee from me; But remember, if ever those smiles pass away, I've the kindest of welcomes for thee. We will talk of the records of days that are gone, Of the noble, the brave, and the free, And when we are parting, at least thou shalt own, I've the kindest of welcomes for thee. I WILL BE KIND TO YOU. I I will be kind to you, kinder than ever, Watching your will in the glance of your eye. Oh! do not think I could cruelly sever A bud from the bough, and then leave it to die! II Check not those natural tears, they are flowing For friends who were kind, ere your lover was known; Yet, you may smile through those tears, you are going With one whose affection shall equal their own. III I will be kind to you, though it may wound you To leave your lov'd home, this atonement I'll make. All my life long, I will strive to surround you With smiles, such as those you resign'd for my sake. IV Surely you cannot believe, if I wanted The sweetest exotic my taste could select, I'd turn away, when my prize was transplanted, And leave it to wither, and die of neglect. I HAVE SEEN YOU, THOUGH UNSEEN. I One fond look my brain has haunted, Since from you estranged I've been, And the wish at length is granted, I have seen you, though unseen. Must I make the weak confession, Yes—degrading though it be; I had hop'd some sad expression Would betray regret for me! II But alas! the dream is over! What I saw I'd fain forget; Nought that spoke the pensive lover— No remembrance! no regret! Looks of love too well I noted, Fond as they were wont to be; But I saw them all devoted To another, not to me! III Oh! I dar'd not venture near you, But your lip too plainly mov'd, Just as when I used to hear you Falsely vow that I was lov'd! I relied, and proof was wanted That my heart your sport had been; And at length the wish is granted, I have seen you, though unseen! I WILL NOT SIGH FOR THEE. I. I will not sigh for thee, no, no! A tear thou shalt not see, no, no! This heart will never break, Not e'en for thy sake. And yet I love thee well, Yes, lady, yes! 'Twere joy with thee to dwell, Yes, lady, yes! I've seen thee frown on me, Yes, lady, yes! Then I'll never sigh for thee. No, no, I ne'er met a form more fair, I ne'er saw brighter hair; I do not wish to part, Yet 'twill not break my heart. And yet I love thee, lady, well, Yes, lady, yes! yes, lady, yes! And yet I love thee, lady, well, Yes, lady, yes! yes, lady, yes! But no, no, I will not sigh! NO, NE'ER CAN THY HOME BE MINE! I I have told thee how sweet the roses are In my home beyond the sea; Where the dark eyed maid, with her sweet guitar, Sits under the orange tree. Then fly, oh fly from this Isle of storm, Where all that is fair must pine, To a sky more blue, and a sun more warm: Henceforth, let thy home be thine. II I have heard thee tell of a sky more blue, And a sun more warm than this; And I've sometimes thought—if thy tale be true, To dwell in that clime were bliss: But oh! when I gaze on my tranquil cot, Where the clematis boughs entwine, The land of the stranger tempts me not, No,—ne'er can thy home be mine! III I will sing to thee, if with me thou'lt rove, The songs of the olden time. Thou wilt never compare with my ardent love The love of this colder clime! Thou wilt scorn the fruits of thy mountain home, Beholding the purple vine; Then come to the land of my birth, oh come, Henceforth let my home be thine. IV Alas! 'tis plain that my mountain home Must ever be scorn'd by thee; And may I not fear that a time will come, When thou wilt have scorn for me? And oh! there is one who loves me here, Whose voice, if less sweet than thine, To my simple taste is far more dear; No, ne'er can thy home be mine. I WOULD BEAR AS MUCH FOR YOU. I I remember how you sooth'd me, when you saw me in distress; There was nothing gave me comfort, but affection's pure caress; Can you doubt me for an instant? Oh, you wrong me, if you do! I remember all your kindness, and I'd bear as much for you. II I remember how you nurs'd me in my sickness, 'gainst my will, How you feign'd to leave my chamber, yet in secret watch'd me still: 'Twas your gentle hand that saved me, and devotion is your due: I remember all your kindness, and I'd bear as much for you. HOW TO BE MORE FIRMLY TRUE. I May we own the pure affection, Plighted by a secret vow; May the love that spurn'd detection Boast its sad endurance now? Yes, love, yes! to those who thought us Merely triflers, thanks are due; For their stern oppression taught us How to be more firmly true! II Say not then that we have wasted Sadly some few years on earth; Grief, just long enough hath lasted To give joy a double worth. To the past still fondly turning, Days less bright we'll keep in view, From that lesson wisely learning How to be more firmly true. I'LL SHED NO TEAR FOR THEE. I I'll shed no tear for thee—no! Tears would but spoil my eyes; If thou would'st go from me—go, The path before thee lies. If other maids have won thee, Let others smile upon thee; Go woo them if thou'rt wise. II I'll smile when thou'rt gone—yes! Don't threaten me, but go; I mean to smile on one—guess If thou his name wouldst know. When gone, thou still returnest; Oh! when thou'rt gone in earnest, How well I'll bear the blow! IN THE SUNNY DAYS DAYS OF LIFE. I In the sunny days of life, As your fond confiding wife, Ever near you, Prompt to cheer you, I will be; But when tears are on your cheek, In your sorrow, if you'd seek The indulgence of a mother, come to me. II Should the friends of brighter days Censure him they used to praise, I'd befriend you, And defend you, You should see; But an error if you'd own, And for erring days atone, As you'd come unto a mother, come to me. MY STEED IS AT THE GATE. I My steed is at the gate, my dear, And I have woo'd thee long; I've been thy partner in the dance, I've listen'd to thy song: I love thee, but I frankly own That these delays I hate, So give an answer to my suit, My steed is at the gate! II I've idly loiter'd many days In meadow and in grove; At night beneath thy tower I've sung The serenade of love. But if I led so dull a life, Thou soon would'st scorn thy mate. I've woo'd thee long—thy answer, quick, My steed is at the gate. III Say “yes,” and thou shalt ever find A faithful knight in me. But answer “no,” I will not vow To pine and die for thee. But say the final word at once, I can no longer wait: A smile have with thee to the church, My steed is at the gate. OLD AGE SITS BENT ON HIS IRON-GRAY STEED. I Old age sits bent on his iron-gray steed, Youth rides erect on his courser black; And little he thinks in his reckless speed, Old age comes on in the very same track! Though one seems strong as the forest tree, The other infirm, and wanting breath; If ever youth baffles old age, 'twill be By rushing into the arms of death. II And youth will quaff, and youth will feast, His lagging foe he'll still deride; Until, when he expects him least, Old age and he stand side by side. He then looks into his toilet glass, And sees old age reflected there; He cries alas! how quickly pass, Bright eyes, and bloom, and raven hair. THE SON OF A SOLDIER A SOLDIER MUST BE. I Oh! dear as you are, tell me not of a home Where my spirit may rest like a bird in a cage; The wing that has early been tempted to roam Must ever be restless, 'till fetter'd by age. I know if you love me, I won your good will, Because I was first of the brave and the free. Then give me a smile to encourage me still, For the son of a soldier a soldier must be. II Oh! dear as you are, could you bid me remain Inactive and dull, I would scorn to obey. A soldier's ambition you shall not restrain, No! breathing a blessing, you'll send me away. You'll watch my return from the brow of the hill, You'll proudly exult when my laurels you see; Then give me a smile to encourage me still, For the son of a soldier a soldier must be. YOU KNOW WE WERE HAPPY. I You saw us together, she stood by my side, Her arm leant on mine, when you last saw my bride; She spoke not, but well were her feelings explain'd, By looks of affection that cannot be feign'd. My home prov'd her fondness: wherever I mov'd, Her hand plac'd to please me some trifle I lov'd; The bliss of my heart must have beam'd from my brow, You know we were happy, oh! pity me now! II You saw us together, again you are here, But she you met with me no longer is near. You now see me lonely, no gentle eyes seek To find out my wishes before I can speak. My dwelling is mournful! no longer I see, Some token, or flower, meant only for me. My anguish of heart is impress'd on my brow; You know we were happy, oh! pity me now! SHE WAS THE FAIREST. I She was the fairest, many there Had long been call'd most bright and fair, Their beaming eyes, their braided hair, Were deem'd the rarest. Unconscious of her charms she came, And startled at her beauty's fame, Blush'd when we breath'd no other name, For she was fairest! II She left us soon a happy bride To roam with one how briefly tried. Oh, woman! by the loved one's side, All ills thou darest. Few years are past, yet she is gone, The widow'd mother weeps alone, O'er infant features like her own, When they were fairest. OH! MINE WAS NOT THE SUDDEN LOVE. I Oh! mine was not the sudden love that's kindled at a glance, I heard not, as I breath'd my vow, the music of the dance. And tho' we met in beauty's court, and thou wert fairest there, I lov'd thee not until I knew that thou wert good as fair. II I cannot call that feeling love, so premature in birth, It is as if the eye could trace the heart's intrinsic worth; Tho' not insensibly I gaz'd on beauty such as thine, 'Twas but Love's temple I ador'd: thy soul, Love's hallow'd shrine. ITALY! BEAUTIFUL LAND! I Italy! Italy! beautiful land! Calmly thy summer sea flows o'er the sand, Home of the laws and the heroes of old, History sanctifies all we behold. Italy! Italy! oh, thou art beautiful! Calmly thy summer sea flows o'er the sand. II Italy! Italy! what tho' I roam, Gazing in rapture, thou art not my home! And tho' her climate is changeful and chill, England, my birth place, is dear to me still. Italy! Italy! tho' thou art beautiful, England, my birth place, is dear to me still! OH! WOULD I WERE UPON THE DECK. I. Oh! would I were upon the deck Of that frail barque which carries thee; On shore I dream of storm and wreck, But at thy side how brave I'd be. Do not dread a woman's tears, Do not dread a woman's fears; For thou shalt see how brave I'll be, Then, dearest, let me go with thee, For thou shalt see how brave I'll be. II. I'd be the first should foes appear To bid thee chase, enslave, or kill; For though his safety may be dear, My lover's fame is dearer still. Do not dread a woman's tears, &amp;c. THE REJECTED! I Not have me! not love me! Oh! what have I said? Sure never was lover so strangely misled. Rejected—and just when I hop'd to be blest! You can't be in earnest—It must be a jest! Remember, remember, how often I've knelt Explicitly telling you all that I felt; And talk'd about poison in accents so wild, So very like torture, you started,—and smiled! Not have me! not love me! Oh! what have I said? &amp;c. II Not have me! not love me! And is it then true That opulent age is the lover for you? 'Gainst rivalry's bloom I would strive,—'tis too much To yield to the terror of rivalry's crutch. Remember, remember, I might call him out, But, Madam, you're scarcely worth fighting about; My sword shall be stainless in blade and in hilt, I thought you a jewel, I find you a jilt! Not have me! not love me! And is it then true, &amp;c. THE ACCEPTED. I I thank thee for that downcast look, and for that blushing cheek, I would not have thee raise those eyes, I would not have thee speak. Tho' mute, I deem thee eloquent, I ask no other sign, While thus thy little hand remains confidingly in mine. II I know you fain would hide from me the tell-tale tears that steal Unbidden forth, and half betray the anxious fears you feel. From friends, long tried and dearly lov'd, the plighted bride must part: Then freely weep, I could not love a cold unfeeling heart. TAKE, TAKE ONCE MORE THY SILV'RY LUTE. I Take, take once more thy silv'ry lute And sing the song I love to hear. Oh, never 'till those lips are mute Shall cease that song my soul to cheer! 'Tis not alone its witching strain: There lies a charm within the chords, Then breathe it to thy lute again, Then breathe it to thy lute again! II When first I heard that spell-wove song, It was at twilight's tender hour; Our hearts were light, our hopes were young, I heard, I loved, and owned their power: And still to me, whene'er it swells, Their wonted spell its notes retain. Of love and thee their music tells, Oh, breathe it to thy lute again! OH! I COME NOT TO UPBRAID THEE. I Oh! I come not to upbraid thee, Nor to woo thee am I here, Though in peril I would aid thee, Though in sorrow I would cheer. Though 'tis thee I'd snatch from danger, On its brink were thousands thrown, Yet the vow of some mere stranger I would trust before thine own. II It will be a source of wonder When we part, I know it well; Why our hearts were torn asunder Let thine own false accents tell. Thou mayst say I did deceive thee, Unprovoked I did renounce; There are many will believe thee, E'en as I believed thee once. III I would peril life to save thee, For no other do I live; No, the love I freely gave thee To no other can I give. For with me all love was over When my first love proved a dream; I have ceased to be thy lover, Love could ne'er survive esteem. THE BATTLE IS FOUGHT. (French Air.) I The battle is fought, and the weapons are sheath'd, The brows of the victors with laurels are wreath'd; Each sword glitters bright, and the blood stains are gone, The triumph of war is remember'd alone. But some may shrink back from this splendid array, Some mourners in tears may turn sadly away. They heed not the pomp of the trophy or wreath, Whose hearts lov'd the lost one who slumbers beneath. II Behold yon fair maid, with a glance of despair Seeks one who she knows too well cannot be there! Till all are gone past, like a statue she stands, Then silently covers her face with her hands. Too hopeless to weep, and too feeble to stir, Each fold of yon banner seems bloody to her. That wreath on his tomb will hang withering now She once hop'd in triumph to twine round his brow. THE OCEAN IS CALM. I The ocean is calm, and the winds are asleep, There is not a wave on the face of the deep. The water all gilded by sunbeams appears, Like dimples of infancy smiling thro' tears. Above as the snowy sails motionless lie, So faint is the summer breeze murmuring by, The waters disturb'd by our boat gently move, Like the soft waving down on the breast of a dove. II When we gaze on the water, how little we know Of floods that unfathom'd are frowning below. Ah! who that now looks on this glittering form Would dream of its terrors in whirlwind and storm; How many, elated with visions of bliss, Have embark'd when the day seem'd as tranquil as this, And thought not of storms and of dangers to come, Though they lurked in the breeze that seem'd wafting them home. SUCH TEARS ARE BLISS. I Oh! give me a sweet and shady bow'r, On the banks of a river, clear and bright, And let not a ray of the sun have pow'r To peep thro' the woodbines from morn till night. Then sing me the songs that I used to hear, In our own sweet home more fair than this; And if on my cheek you behold a tear, Sing on, sing on, for such tears are bliss! II When last we met in that lonely bow'r, We knew not the meaning of such fond tears. We are older now and mourn for some Who shar'd in the pleasure of former years. Ah! when I remember how oft they heard That song in a shady spot like this, Tho' a tear may fall from ev'ry word, Sing on, sing on, for such tears are bliss! OH! ASK ME NOT TO BE YOUR BRIDE. I Oh! ask me not to be your bride; Oh! do not call me fair; For I have thrown the wreath aside I once was proud to wear. And do not gaze upon my cheek, It hath no charms for thee, Tho' I am young, 'tis vain to seek The charms of youth in me. II And yet I think I must have been As gay as those I meet: For I remember to have seen Young lovers at my feet. And they were blythe and merry men, And loved a merry eye; Ah! sure I was like others then, But no, 'tis all gone by. III One came at last who was my choice, He perished on the sea; Still, still I hear the hateful voice That told the tale to me. Then ask me not to be your bride, Oh! do not call me fair, For I have thrown the wreath aside I once was proud to wear. I WILL LISTEN. I Come, sing to me thy sweetest lay, My own dear love! come, sing to me; Though one by one we've seen the ray Of each bright planet pass away, And thought, alas, 'twill soon be day, Yet I will listen still to thee. II Come sing to me! the rills that flow, Through violet beds most sweet must be. Winds pilfer sweets where roses grow, And are those notes so sweet? ah! no, Their charms to those sweet lips they owe, And I will listen still to thee. MY HARP OF SIGHS. I Oh, no! I am not what I was, when last I sung to thee; The playful song, that won thy smile, is not the song for me: My harp of smiles upon the earth unstrung and broken lies; And well I know that one so young will scorn my harp of sighs. II I have no song of youth and hope, that does not close in care; I have no tale of woman's love, that ends not in despair: I only breathe the name of joy, to tell how soon it dies; I only sing the songs that suit this dear, dear harp of sighs! III I could not, if I would, be gay, for when I touch the chords, I throw a shade of sadness o'er the melody, and words: Grief through her darken'd glass discerns no sunshine in the skies, The voice must mourn that mingles with thy notes,—my harp of sighs! MY HARP OF SMILES. I Oh! if upon my harp of smiles one string may still be found; For thee, dear love, I'll strive to wake its long neglected sound: I will be gay, that smile of thine ne'er shone on me in vain; Come forth, my harp of smiles, I'll sing my cheerful songs again! II I thought that in my solitude such songs would ne'er be sung; But thou art here, and I am chang'd, my very heart feels young: One link restor'd, we reunite the long-lost broken chain; Come forth my harp of smiles, I'll sing my cheerful songs again! III I'll sing of love, ay! love like thine, still faithful to its vow; I'll sing of joy—the boundless joy that fills my bosom now; I'll tell thee tales of constancy that triumphs over pain; Come forth my harp of smiles, I'll sing my cheerful songs again! DECK NOT WITH GEMS. I Deck not with gems that lovely form for me, They in my eyes add no charm to thee; Braid not for me the tresses of thy hair, I must have loved thee had'st thou not been fair. II How oft, when half in tears hast thou beguiled The sorrow from my heart, and I have smiled: Oh! form'd alike my tears and smiles to share, I must have loved thee hadst thou not been fair. III Time on that cheek his with'ring hand may press, He may do all but make me love thee less; The mind defies him, and thy charm lies there. I must have loved thee hadst thou not been fair. THE LOVE-KNOT. I You do not now remember This ribbon, once so gay; And yet it was your own gift, Upon our wedding-day. You had no gems to offer, I never sigh'd for them; I prized this little love-knot, Beyond the brightest gem. II I thought you would not know it, Alas, 'tis faded now! No longer fit to flutter Upon a bridal-brow. Yet once a-year I'll wear it, If triflers scorn its hue: I'll tell them I'm as happy As when this knot was new. A FEATHER IN MY CAP. I My heart was free, you caught it: My friends look'd on, and thought it A feather in my cap to win your love: Your love! so many sought it, A feather in my cap t'will prove, Tho' we're no more together; Go, trifler go, your fickle love Was nothing but a feather! II You are not what I thought you: When long ago I sought you, Your face was fair, but lurking there Is a frown that pride hath taught you. Then go, some other victim find, Forgetting, I'll forgive you; Since vanity has chang'd your mind, I'll change my own and leave you. CHARITY. I. Look on the radiant splendour of the night; Say, were each little star, that sheds its light O'er that vast arch to shade its orb, and say, “The skies are bright enough without my ray;” Would not the night be dark? II. And thus it is with Charity, Though small thy gift may seem to be Withhold it not, for like the night, By countless little stars made bright, Thy offering, joined to thousands more, Shall brighten dwellings dark before. III. Have you not seen some lovely bow'r Array'd with ev'ry summer flow'r? Each plant gives fragrance, it is not One scent, one bloom, adorns the spot. No, each small bud perfumes the air, And has its own sweet station there. CAN WE BELIEVE THIS WORLD OF OURS. I Can we believe this world of ours Is but a snare that we must shun, Grasping the thorns, and not the flow'rs, Seeking the gloom, and not the sun! When by sweet music's voice invited, Ought we in scorn to turn away? When with the joyous dance delighted, Are we to blame if we delay? II Must we renounce each art and science, As we would shun some hateful spell; And from each social fond alliance, Turn to the cloister and the cell? No, it is not to gloom and terror, Virtue will fly from harmless mirth; Kind to misfortune, mild to error, Blessing and blest she walks the earth! A SOLITARY GRIEF. I Oh! ask me not what grief it was That wrought this change in me, What sorrow wither'd, one by one The smiles you used to see. The oak knows not which storm remov'd Its fairest summer leaf; A heart that's blighted dwells not on A solitary grief. II I will not speak of scorn from her To whom I fondly knelt; I will not name a friend's deceit, Though that too I have felt. The sinking bark heeds not what wave Has hurl'd it on the reef; A heart that's blighted dwells not on A solitary grief. III You're happy, and if one dark cloud Is seen 'mid tranquil years; In mem'ry's store you treasure up That one sad source of tears: But in my darker destiny, The smiles were few and brief; The heart that's blighted dwells not on A solitary grief. THE BEST WISH. I Say, my child, what would you do? If a fairy said to you,— “With my hand I'll wave my wand, And before me you shall stand, Chang'd in mind, and form, and voice, To whate'er may be your choice.” II Soon the child's reply is heard: “I would be a merry bird, Playing blithely as I please, Ever 'mid the flow'rs and trees; In the sunshine all day long, And my only task, a song!” III “Flow'rs and sunshine soon will go: Think my child of frost and snow; When the forest boughs are bare Will the bird be happy there? Pause awhile, and then rejoice That you cannot have your choice. IV “Rather be a man of worth, Prompt to do good deeds on earth; Work with zeal, your task will prove Easy as the songs you love. They have sunshine, they have flow'rs, Who look back on well spent hours!” GRIEF WAS SENT THEE FOR THY GOOD. I In the scenes of former pleasure, Present anguish hast thou felt? O'er thy fond heart's dearest treasure, As a mourner hast thou knelt? In the hour of deep affliction, Let no impious thought intrude, Meekly bow, with this conviction— Grief was sent thee for thy good. II Some there are who seem exempted From the doom incurr'd by all. Are they not more sorely tempted! Are they not the first to fall? As a mother's firm denial Checks her infant's wayward mood, Wisdom lurks in ev'ry trial: Grief was sent thee for thy good. VIRTUE AND ERROR. I Many there are who of their lot complain; Many there are who rail at fate in vain; But on himself weak man should vent his rage, Error in youth must lead to gloom in age. II Many there are content in humblest lot: Many there are, though poor, who murmur not: Write then in gold on their recording page: Virtue in youth must lead to bliss in age. YOU NEVER KNEW ANNETTE. I You praise each youthful form you see, And love is still your theme; And when you win no praise from me, You say how cold I seem. You know not what it is to pine With ceaseless vain regret; You never felt a love like mine, You never knew Annette. II For ever changing, still you rove, As I in boyhood roved; But when you tell me this is love, It proves you never loved. To many idols you have knelt, And therefore soon forget; But what I feel, you never felt, You never knew Annette. SUCH THINGS WERE. I Time flies when he should linger most, The brightest joys are soonest lost; And swiftly pass the hours away, When friends are near, and hearts are gay. The fairest scenes that mirth can bring Will add a feather to his wing; And when his path is mark'd with care, We think in sorrow such things were. II In happy hours we often say, In scenes like these we must be gay; But, if we lose one valued friend, Our feelings change, our pleasures end. We mourn the looks so truly dear, We miss the voice we used to hear; The scene is changed, and sadly there, We must remember such things were. III In ev'ry path we seek alone, We sadly sigh for something gone; In every walk some spot is seen, Where that lost friend hath lately been; In ev'ry song, in ev'ry dance, We miss a tone, a step, a glance; We think of joys we used to share, And say in sorrow such things were. THE MONKEY JACKET. I In such a coat come not to me, Oh! Captain come not hither; So loose a fit befits not thee, Too rough for fairest weather. For travellers not much amiss, On night coach, or in packet; But why in this metropolis, Why wear a monkey jacket? II At Gardens Zoological, If monkey tricks attract them, The girls see monkeys large and small, Then why should dandies act them? The hairy phiz that suits an ape, I own you do not lack it; But why assume the monkey shape, Why wear a monkey jacket? III You sally forth into the street, All well prepared to rough it; And ev'ry timid belle you meet May half expect a buffet. My choler rises at your cuffs, Your coat, I must attack it; And yet I dread some coarse rebuffs, From such a monkey jacket! WITH BEATING HEART AND TREMBLING STEP. I With beating heart and trembling step, the maiden left her home, She clung for aid to one who spoke of happy days to come: The victim heard not then the voice of conscience whispering low: “Such bliss as guiltless thou hast known, the guilty never know.” II He promis'd splendour, gems, and gold; she heard of these unmov'd; He promis'd changeless constancy, she listen'd and she lov'd! Why was there not some watchful friend to warn her of the foe: “Such bliss as guiltless thou hast known, the guilty never know.” III Again she sees her native vale, again she looks for some Who lov'd in her that mean abode, which once she called her home: But there in hopeless solitude repentant tears must flow: “Such bliss as guiltless thou hast known, the guilty never know.” THE BLACK-BALL'D MAN. I I've got my friends to put me up at all the clubs in town, But, do you know, 'twixt friend and foe, the clubs have knock'd me down. You're well aware at Petty-town the figure that I make, And now to be used scurvily, there must be some mistake. II In Regent Street whom should I meet, why young Sir Harry Miles! He has my vote at Petty-town, how civilly he smiles. I heard him say at Crockford's club, great interest he'd make, And then of course, propose me, so there can be no mistake. III We met again, he tried in vain to look another way; At length he said, “I'm quite annoy'd at what I have to say. I walk'd about to speak your praise, until my legs did ache, But all your balls were black as ink! there must be some mistake!” IV On both United Services, the little and the great, To offer them my services, I civilly did wait; At both the people sat and laugh'd until their sides did shake, And said they had no civil list! and that was no mistake. V The Wyndham I attempted; but the Wyndham blew me back; Then White's, and what's astonishing, at White's the balls were black! Upon the Athenæum steps the people made me quake, With wigs and canes, and shovel hats; there must be some mistake. VI The Travellers is only meant, (and that I think's a pity,) For travellers who serve commercial houses in the city. So still at some dull coffee-house, alone my meal I make, The black-ball'd man! and yet I'm sure—there must be some mistake! OH! HOW BLEST THE LOVER. I. Oh! how blest the lover, When the battle's rage is over, Who perceives The myrtle leaves, His true-love's cot that cover. Though danger hover'd o'er him, Yet his foes have fled before him. Again he's bless'd, Again he's press'd To fond hearts that adore him. II. Children round him gather, And slily ask him whether They may behold His banner's fold, And wear his snowy feather. They listen to his story, And sages weak and hoary Come forth to view His laurels too, And talk of wounds and glory. III. Many lips entreat him To linger while they greet him. He rushes on, To welcome one, The girl who flies to meet him. Oh! how blest, &amp;c. DEARER THAN LIFE THOU ART. I Dearer than life thou art, can I say more? True, I have told thee so often before; But of thy apathy still I complain, Therefore, I tell it thee over again: Thou wert my hope, 'mid the perils of war, Dearer than life thou art, dearer by far! II Some may have eloquent lips I confess, Accents more studied their feelings express; But not a lover before thee has knelt, Feeling one half of the love I have felt. Dear thou art still, though my bliss thou may'st mar, Dearer than life, thou art dearer by far! III If thou art won by gay lovers like these, Still thou shalt find me endeavour to please; Woo thee in accents as proud as their own, Tell thee, thy graces would honour a throne; Call thee my rose-bud, my diamond, my star; Dearer than life thou art, dearer by far! NO VESSEL IS IN SIGHT. I On the summit of the highest cliff that overhangs the deep, Why daily sits that aged dame? and wherefore does she weep? Why leans she o'er the vast abyss from morning's dawn till night, And wherefore doth she wave a scarf? No vessel is in sight. II Oh! she was fam'd for beauty once, though pale and haggard now, Her hair in raven ringlets curl'd around her snowy brow; And plighted to a sailor youth, she sought that dizzy height To welcome him; all day she gaz'd—no vessel was in sight! III He came not—oh! he never came! none knew in what wild storm Her lover's fragile bark went down, none found his lifeless form; And daily o'er that vast abyss she leans from morn till night, And cries when darkness veils the sea—“No vessel is in sight!” HAPPY FACES! I Happy faces! happy faces! On your beauty let me gaze; May the foe to other graces Spare the charm I love to praise. Age may trace the deepest wrinkle, Yet no frown he may impart; Time the chilling snow may sprinkle O'er the head, yet spare the heart Happy faces! Happy faces! &amp;c. II Happy faces! happy faces! Some will say you wither fast; But I'll tell how your graces May through life be made to last. If another ne'er was wounded When in thoughtless mirth you smil'd, Then old age, by friends surrounded, May be cheerful as a child. Happy faces! Happy faces! &amp;c. I CANNOT DANCE TO-NIGHT! I Oh! when they brought me hither, they wonder'd at my wild delight, But would I were at home again, I cannot dance to-night! How can they all look so cheerful? the dance seems strangely dull to me; The music sounds so mournful, what can the reason be? Oh! when they brought me hither, they wonder'd at my wild delight, But I would I were at home again, I cannot dance to-night! II Hark! hark! at length he's coming, I'm not weary—let me stay! I hear his laugh distinctly now, 'twill chase the gloom away. Oh! would that I were near him, he sees me not amid the crowd, He hears me not—ah! would I dared to breathe his name aloud. Oh! when they brought me hither, they wonder'd at my wild delight, But would I were at home again, I cannot dance to-night! III He leaves that group of triflers, and with the smile I love to see, He seems to seek for some one—oh! is it not for me? No, no! 'tis for that dark-eyed girl, I see her now return his glance, He passes me, he takes her hand, he leads her to the dance! Oh! when they brought me hither, they wonder'd at my wild delight, But would I were at home again, I cannot dance to-night! I GAVE YOU MY HEART. I. I gave you my gold, and how little I thought In the first days of love, 'twas my gold that you sought. I will not deny I exulted to see One praised by too many look kindly on me: And the wonder you feign'd, when my treasure was told, Made my poor heart rejoice when I gave you my gold. Your smile is the wealth that I fain would behold, For I gave you my heart ere I gave you my gold. II. I gave you my gold as I'd give it you now; They tell me 'tis wasted, I ask you not how. The pleasures it bought made you wander from me, Could you now be content, oh! how happy I'd be. Your smile is the wealth that I fain would behold, For I gave you my heart ere I gave you my gold: I'LL LIVE ON THE SMILES. I I love you sincerely, though often you tell me I have not the symptoms that lovers should wear; You say I should languish, and strive to compel me To sue for your pity, with sighs of despair. Yet think not that sighing, of love, is a token: You frown, yet I cannot contrive to repine; If hearts are not worth your regard till they're broken, I trust, my fair lady, you'll never have mine! II You tell me my cheek wears no trace of dejection, Yet do not believe that I love you the less; You say I am cheerful, and surely affection May brighten the spirits but cannot depress. When present you always preserve me from sorrow, And even when absent you'll drive it away, For if I should chance not to see you to-morrow, I'll live on the smiles that you gave me to-day. THE FRIENDS WHO SMILE NO MORE. I I've seen you oft select a flower, To wear upon some festive day; But faded ere the evening hour, Without a thought 'twas thrown away! The flow'rs that deck a gay saloon We prize not, when their bloom is o'er; And do we not forget as soon The once gay friends who smile no more. II The withered rose we soon replace, With one as fair as that we lose; And won by some attractive face, As soon another friend we choose: But fleeting must such friendship prove, And dearer ties we shall deplore, When we, like those we used to love, Know what it is to smile no more. THE BIRTH OF A SMILE. I When love was a novice a long time ago, Deck'd out by mama with a quiver and bow, He used them as playthings, and threw out his darts At doves and at sparrows, and thought not of hearts. But shooting at random is dangerous play, A fair nymph was struck by an arrow one day; And Cupid, who then was not so harden'd in guilt, Turn'd pale at the sight of the blood he had spilt. II “Oh! what can I do for my pretty young maid? I'll be your physician,” the penitent said: “Come tell me your symptoms.” “Alas!” she replied, “A fluttering pulse and a pain in my side: And a feverish feeling when Damon is nigh, And a pang when he leaves me, I cannot tell why: Oh! cure me, or shoot Damon also; I'm sure If he shared my feelings I'd ask for no cure.” III “No, no, you shall shoot him yourself,” he replied; “I'll give you my weapon and fight on your side; Prepare your artillery, this way he went. I see him, we'll wound him, make ready, present. I'll send a new light to your eyes, and give birth To a mingled expression, half archness, half mirth; I'll shew him your teeth when your little mouth speaks, And place a small dimple in one of your cheeks.” IV These charms in succession were fruitlessly tried: The youth felt no fever, no pain, in his side. “Now use all your arrows at once,” cried the child; She did so, and Damon was hers, for she smil'd! “Delightful! delightful!” said Cupid, “I've found A charm of all others most certain to wound: Though eyes, teeth, and dimples may fail for awhile, Combine them, and call the bright weapon a smile!” THE TWO WEDDINGS. I Around the marble altar, a hundred tapers blaze; Upon the bride and bridegroom, a hundred vassals gaze: A hundred high born ladies upon the princess wait, A hundred arm'd retainers are mounted at the gate. The vow is said, the hymn is sung, Oh! both are fair and both are young; With what delight they smile to-night, With them the future must be bright; Bright it may be, but their state Gives no surety to either; Happy indeed is their fate, If love brings them together. II Beside a rural altar, two simple peasants stand, No bridal gems and dresses have they at their command: Few friends assemble round them, few eager gazers wait. And when they reach their dwelling, no vassal opes the gate. The vow is said, the hymn is sung; And both are fair and both are young: Alas! to-day, tho' blithe and gay, In poverty love may decay! Poor they may be, but their state Gives no sorrow to either; Happy indeed is their fate If love brings them together. THE SONG OF MY CHOICE. I I never wish to see This path, if not with thee, Nor hear that song divine From any lip but thine. No path is gay, If thou'rt away, And 'tis thy voice Now makes that song my choice. I never wish to see, &amp;c. II Oh, let the flowers decay, While thou art still away. The song must then be mute, And none shall touch thy lute. But flowers will bloom, When thou'rt come home, And that sweet strain Shall cheer my heart again. I never wish to see, &amp;c. CAN YOU NAME HER NOW SO LIGHTLY! I Can you name her now so lightly, Once the idol of you all? When a star hath shone so brightly, Can you glory in its fall? Shall the friends who came around her When her smile could bliss impart, Now a shaft is rais'd to wound her, Rush to guide it to her heart. II When the stigma is upon her Shall the proudest stand aloof? When the crowd proclaim dishonour Will they listen without proof? Shall it almost seem a duty Without proof to say she errs? 'Tis, alas! the fate of beauty So pre-eminent as hers. III Oh! 'tis well when beauty's dwelling Is a calmer, purer sphere; Envy points at all excelling Those in fashion's bright career; And to fame, the taint is surest, 'Mid the busy haunts of men; As the snow remains the purest On the mountain and the glen. WILLIAM AND ADELAIDE. I Oh, fondly shall history point to the page Where the youth of that Prince is recorded; Whose choice, to the high born and proud of the age, A noble example afforded. The son of a monarch, full well hath he earn'd, The laurels of national story! From safety's luxurious pathway he turn'd, And chose that of danger and glory! II On England's best bulwark, her man-of-war's deck, With England's free banner above him, The Prince brav'd the terrors of battle and wreck, And taught her young heroes to love him. He fought under Rodney, the good and the brave, Whose name gilds our national story, And saw the green laurel of victory wave O'er the chief who had led him to glory! III A sailor is call'd to his forefathers' throne, His people with rapture receive him; And well may a Monarch exultingly own The warm-hearted welcome they give him. Oh, long may he live, may his prosperous reign Be enroll'd in our national story; May William and Adelaide ever retain True subjects—the guards of their glory! AND HAVE I LIVED TO HEAR THEE BLAME. I And have I lived to hear thee blame, To see thee turn those eyes away? I thought, if slander breath'd my name, That thou wouldst wipe the stain away. But that delusive thought is gone, And blest again I ne'er shall be. The time will come when thou wilt own That I deserv'd not this from thee. II I've watch'd for thee thro' weary days, I've pray'd for thee thro' nights of gloom, I fondly strove to win thy praise, Yet scorn and hatred are my doom. Though I have sunk before thy frown, The world's contempt unmov'd I'll see; The time will come when thou wilt own That I deserv'd not this from thee. HE LOVES ME NOT WITH THAT FOND LOVE. I I hear him say he loves me well, And I would fain believe; He vows he'll ne'er abandon me, And why should he deceive? Yet still I think—and at the thought My eyes with tears are dim, He loves me not with that fond love Which I have felt for him. II He leaves me for the mountain chase, And for the courtly scene; To me it were the greatest bliss To be where he has been. He leaves me that his laughing lip May touch the goblet's brim; He loves me not with that fond love Which I have felt for him. III Oh! woman dwells in loneliness While restless man may rove; Perhaps he was not made to feel Her all engrossing love. And thus I watch his late return, My fading lamp I trim; He loves me not with that fond love Which I have felt for him. 'TIS WHEN NO TRIFLER LINGERS. I She is not nam'd, when those are near Whose cold hearts condemn the tear That still is shed for one so dear. Say not, she is not nam'd among us— You little dream how much you wrong us. She is not nam'd when those are near, &amp;c. II Some may be forc'd in smiles to dress The mem'ry of a past distress, Think you that they feel the less? Oh! do not say that we forget her, Be silent 'till you know us better. She is not nam'd when those are near, &amp;c. III 'Tis when no trifler lingers near, With apathy our words to hear, We breathe the name of one so dear. We mourn her still, we name her only When all around is sad and lonely. She is not nam'd when those are near, &amp;c. WHEN I MEAN TO DEPART. I When I mean to depart, not a word will I say, No tear, as I leave thee, my grief shall betray; Yes, for once I'll deceive, and thou'lt pardon that deceit, One word at such a moment could'st thou repeat? No, no, no! sister dear, sister dear! Silently we'll part, Oh, while I'm here, shed no tear But press me to thy heart! II We shall soon meet again, never doubt 'twill be so, They who never parted such joy never know. Welcome me when I come, and thy welcome will be sweet, One word when we are parting could'st thou repeat? No, no, no, &amp;c. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[VOLUME TWO] POEMS. THE ABSENTEE. If England's isle is favour'd; if her plains Are sown and reaped by happy, healthful swains; If in her streets and palaces, the light Of wealth and splendour sparkles day and night; If in her capital profusion smiles, She sends the overplus to other isles; If her white rustic cottages retain A beauteous neatness, sought elsewhere in vain; Her boundless charity a joy imparts To humbler dwellings, and less cheerful hearts. When in her halls the young and lovely meet, When nought but tuneful sounds, and dancing feet, Are heard and seen;—when costly jewels blaze, Reflecting the unnumbered lamps, whose rays Beam like the noon-day sun;—then charity May animate each bosom, and may be The leader of the sports: and when at last The revellers are gone, the splendour past, It may cause joy elsewhere, and keep aloof The shades of sorrow from a peasant's roof. Much has been done; but while some ills remain, Let not the wretched cry for help in vain; Send forth the willing tribute, every deed Of charity is blessed, and it shall lead To a more perfect union. Erin feels The kindness of the friendly hand which heals Her present wounds.—Oh! may dissension cease; May perfect confidence, and perfect peace Unite the sister kingdoms—ne'er to part, Cemented by a union of the heart. But oh, ye Renegades! ye Absentees! Who fly from home for luxury and ease, Draining the country of its produce; taking Each shilling you can grasp, and then forsaking Your native land, and the poor slaves whose toil Drew forth your wealth from the luxuriant soil; Say, is it just to draw your riches thence, And leave behind no trifling recompense? To fill your purse, and then with lavish hands To scatter its contents in foreign lands? Lands, where each patriot heart your course should shun, And scorn Hibernia's cold degenerate son. Extensive and superb is your estate, Your grounds magnificent—your income great; Your mansion noble. Has affliction's breath Fann'd it, and changed it to the house of death? Why are the windows shut—the portals closed? Why is the weary traveller opposed? Why does no smoke from chimney-tops ascend, Showing good cheer within?—Is there no friend— No welcome guest in yonder ancient hall? No—nor a host to welcome! dark are all Those once gay chambers; and no more we see Erin's proverbial hospitality. Oh! far beyond a proverb was their warm— Their hospitable welcome; it could charm The saddest stranger from his silent mood, Imparting sweetness to the coarsest food: But thus deserted by their nobles; left Drained of their opulence; almost bereft Of quiet dwellings, while the same good will, The same kind warmth of heart pervades them still; We mourn for them, and with disgust we see The cause of all—the heartless Absentee. Why is his mansion closed? Alas! that gate Has seldom moved upon its hinge of late; The Lord is absent seeking purer air, In Piccadilly, or in Grosvenor Square. Does public business call on him? if so, It may be unavoidable.—Oh, no! Many have good excuses, go they must When business calls; and we sincerely trust Their counsels in the state may make amends For their long absence:—but my blame extends To those who go uncalled, and only go To find a wider field for pomp and show; Drowning all patriot thoughts in baser joys, And spending Irish coin on English toys: And when the mischief they have caused breaks forth, They look amazed, and wonder that the earth Should so uncivilly refuse to give Its produce;—or that Irishmen should live In discontent and pain, while agents pay To each his wages—some few pence a day! Go fashion—to the house of mourning go! With that warm cheek of fire—that heart of snow, There will that flushing cheek be pale with dread, When thy glance rests on the unconscious dead; There will that heart's unthinking coldness melt, Subdued by better feelings—now unfelt. Thy lively spirit shrinks from sorrow's breath; What has that glowing form to do with death? Disease may rage—thy fellow-men may be Hurled to their graves; but, what is that to thee? Gaze on the dead—restrain thy heart's disgust— What he is, thou shalt be—mere lifeless dust! The spring is spent in London's gay career, And in the warmer season of the year, An English cottage-villa near the sea Is the retreat of Erin's Absentee! The winter finds him in the streets of Bath; Spring reconducts him to the London path; His road is circular, its course pursuing, It leads to nothing—but his country's ruin. Yet has not nature, with a liberal hand, Scattered her beauties o'er his native land? Killarney's lakes, and rocks, and Wicklow's glens Are lovely, and unrivalled; pencils—pens— Can ne'er describe, or paint them. Then survey Dublin—still smiling o'er her beauteous bay, And own that Erin is too fair for thee, Deserter! Renegade! and Absentee! FASHIONABLE ECLOGUES. I. Scene—Junior United Service Club. CAPTAIN BIGGS AND LIEUTENANT WILKINS.CAPTAIN. Come, Charles! another glass, my boy! I've gained my end, my point is carried; One bumper more to wish me joy— When next we meet I shall be married. I knew you'd stare—but can you guess Who is the object of my passion? Oh! she's the pink of loveliness, The very paragon of fashion! Nay, do not try—you'll guess in vain— And yet, upon consideration, I own the case is pretty plain, You must have noticed the flirtation. 'Tis Fanny Miles! the reigning belle! The all-accomplished, pretty Fanny! You must confess I've managed well To win a prize sought by so many.LIEUTENANT. I am surprised, I must allow, I thought the girl was too capricious.CAPTAIN. Nay, nay, she never loved till now.LIEUTENANT. Well, but the mother's so ambitious, She will make up to Earls and Dukes, And now and then is disconcerted By chilling slights, and such rebukes As glasses raised, or eyes averted.CAPTAIN. That may be over-anxious zeal, To elevate her only daughter; You cannot feel as mothers feel.LIEUTENANT. No—but the girl—you're sure you've caught her? You think she loves you?CAPTAIN. Think she loves! How can you ask so cold a question. Her pallid cheek her passion proves—LIEUTENANT. Pooh! that may all be indigestion!CAPTAIN. Oh! do not jest; she doats on me: There ne'er was woman so devoted.LIEUTENANT. Since she came out—stop—let me see,— On one—two—three—four—five she's doated. Her dotage may pass off.CAPTAIN.You wrong The kindest of all earthly creatures! Did frailty ever yet belong To such a set of faultless features? Don't smile, for I'll convince you yet, A patient listener entreating; I'll say, how, when, and where we met, And all that happened at the meeting. It was at Almack's; she had got One ticket, and she begg'd another; But Lady C. declared she'd not For worlds admit the humdrum mother.LIEUTENANT. And yet the daughter went?CAPTAIN. Oh yes!— You know—that is—what should prevent her?LIEUTENANT. If 'gainst my parent, I confess, A door were shut, I'd scorn to enter.CAPTAIN.One ticket came—how could it please Maternal feelings not to use it? A ticket for the Duke of D's,— Or even Almack's—who'd refuse it?LIEUTENANT. Are girls so mean! Well, well, proceed. She went, it seems—and there you met her?CAPTAIN. We met—we waltzed—and we agreed To meet again—could I forget her? I called next day, and Mr. Miles, And Mrs. Miles seem'd charm'd to know me, Contributing with many smiles Each kind attention they could show me. And I was ask'd to dine and sup, And cards for balls were never wanting. The carriage came and took me up— We went together, t'was enchanting! I saw at once it was their aim That she and I should be united, For every morning, when I came, To something gay I was invited. In purchases, she sought my taste; Where'er we went, 'twas I escorted; In gallopades, I held her waist; In morning walks, my arm supported. I saw the time was come, in fact, When honour bade me to disclose all, So in the Opera's last act Last night—I whisper'd a proposal!LIEUTENANT. And what said Fanny?CAPTAIN.Oh! she sigh'd— And raised her fan a blush to smother. I gently breathed, “Oh! with what pride Shall I present you to my brother.” She started—(timid pet!) the word Was premature—the thought a bad one. “Brother!” she said; “I never heard— You never mention'd that you had one.” “My elder brother!” I exclaim'd. She turn'd away—(sweet bashful creature! To hear her future brother named No doubt had crimson'd ev'ry feature.) Then pleading earnestly I stood, With half-averted face she heard me, And answer'd “Sir—you're—very—good—” But to her “dear mamma” referred me. I hurried home, and quickly wrote, As 'twere with wand of necromancer; To Mrs. Miles I sent the note, And now I'm waiting for the answer.LIEUTENANT. Sit down, my friend—don't fidget so— Those men at breakfast will observe us— Sit down, I beg of you—CAPTAIN. Oh! no, I really can't, I am so nervous. Ha! what is this!—a note for me! 'Tis it!—“No answer” did the man say?— Now then my longing eyes will see All that sincere affection can say! (reads)“Sir—your obliging note—high sense— My daughter has—of the great honour— Of good opinion—preference—” There, my boy!—there—'tis plain I've won her! (reads again) “But—you're a younger brother, Sir! And I must say—you will excuse it— You were to blame to think of her; And your proposal—must refuse it. “I think it best to add at once, That in declining your acquaintance—” I'll read no more!—Oh, idiot! dunce! How shall I bear this cruel sentence? LIEUTENANT. Be calm, my friend.CAPTAIN.Alas! till now, I never knew what blighted hope meant.LIEUTENANT. Be pacified.CAPTAIN.Ah! tell me how I best may manage an elopement. I'll seek a druggist—happy plan! And I will ask him—LIEUTENANT. Pray be placid!CAPTAIN.For Epsom crystals; but the man I'll bribe to give oxalic acid!LIEUTENANT. Nay, seek amusement—it is right.CAPTAIN. I'll tell my man to load my pistols.LIEUTENANT. Come to the opera to-night.CAPTAIN. I'll go and buy the fatal crystals.LIEUTENANT.I've got two tickets—'tis a sin To die despairing. Come, my crony!CAPTAIN.Well—to please you—I'll just drop in And take one peep at Taglioni. II. Scene—The Governor's Study. SQUIRE LONG AND LONG JUNIOR. SQUIRE LONG. George, why don't you marry?—at your time of life 'Tis a man's bounden duty to look for a wife. LONG, JUN?. Your will is my law, Sir; but what can I do? The ladies I fix upon never please you! SQUIRE LONG. No, George, but your father your interest watches. I've pointed out three or four excellent matches. LONG, JUN?. Your will is my law, Sir; but then, do you see, The ladies you fix upon never please me. SQUIRE LONG. Why zounds! George, you don't go the right way to work, Make up to the Fox-hunting Heiress from York. LONG, JUN?. The steeple chase lady!—If after that spec There's less danger of breaking my heart than my neck; A brilliant her eye, but a ruby her nose is, Horse laughter her smile, and her bloom cabbage roses! SQUIRE LONG. Oh! George, you provoke me; but say, have you seen The rich and rare private theatrical Queen? Who gets up the plays down at Splashington Hall, First Manager—Dramatist—Actress—and all! LONG, JUN?. No! not the Blue Lady who rules the Green-room, Artificial in attitude, simper, and bloom; Who looks up so loving in Romeo's face, Returning with gusto each sigh and embrace. To make a proscenium she'd split my saloon, And darken it all for rehearsals at noon. 'Twould ruffle me, Sir—why, 'twould ruffle a saint To live amid canvass, gilt paper and paint. SQUIRE LONG. What think you then, George, of the Baronet's widow, The lady of arable, pasture, and meadow? LONG, JUN?. Sir Acre's relict? No, no, my good Sir, For ruin lurks under rich widows like her. The crops that she cuts, and the beasts that she kills Are all melted down in her milliner's bills! Don't talk of her produce—its merit must stop, If I cannot prevent her from wearing a crop! Her hey-day is endless; she'll add to my trouble, And into straw bonnets she'd turn all my stubble! SQUIRE LONG. Miss Blonda, the beauty—what think you of her The beauty, par excellence—can you demur? LONG, JUN?. The belle of the public? Ah! no, Sir, I seek For one with the first bloom of youth on her cheek; The belle of my own individual choice, Not hawk'd about yearly by Fashion's shrill voice: Exhibited here, and exhibited there, Until, so long used to vulgarity's stare, So petted by connoisseur, sculptor and painter, My home-admiration could never content her! If I praised her, she'd say, “Oh! I've heard that before; Indeed, my Lord So and So used to say more!” SQUIRE LONG. Well, George, you shan't marry a beauty; you shan't; There's plain Miss Golightly, who wants a gallant. Besides, she writes novels— LONG, JUN?. Ay, when I'm in haste To make love to a gorgon, she'll be to my taste. But worse—oh! a thousand times worse than her looks, Is the thought of her putting me into her books! When wanting a chapter, how pleasant to catch Some foible of mine, just to fill up a sketch! How very convenient, when other themes flag To have me, just like a wild fox in a bag, And then hunt me out, giving all but my name, While those who peruse the three volumes exclaim: “Oh! dear me, how like him; how very absurd! That's meant for her husband, I give you my word! How wrong of her, though—the resemblance must strike! How very improper! Good gracious, how like!” SQUIRE LONG. Well, George, there's Miss Wilkins; the lady they laud For graces acquired whilst living abroad. Her singing; her playing! LONG, JUN?. Why no, I confess She's too foreign in manner—too foreign in dress; In all that she utters and does, I detect A something that tells me she aims at effect, And copying Frenchified airs; after all She wears the French fashions that suit a French doll; Her singing is squall, and her laughter is giggle! Her figure all bustle, her dancing all wriggle! SQUIRE LONG. But, zounds, you must marry! At your time of life 'Tis a man's bounden duty to look for a wife. LONG, JUN?. Your will is my law, Sir—but what can I do? The ladies I fix upon never please you. SQUIRE LONG. No, George; but your father your interest watches: I've pointed out several excellent matches! LONG, JUN?. Your will is my law, Sir, but then do you see, The ladies you fix upon never please me! III. Scene—Mrs. Long's Boudoir. MRS. AND MISS LONG. MRS. LONG. My darling daughter, come to me; Why is your cheek so pale? To fond maternal ears reveal Your first-love's faltering tale. You love young Lord Fitzlackstiver— (Incomparable youth! What fascinating eyes he has!)— You love him?—speak the truth. MISS LONG. No—no—I do not love him—no— That word is far too tame; A faintness comes all over me When others breathe his name. I doat upon him! oh, Mamma, Don't tell me I am wrong; You know he comes here every day, And stays here all day long. MRS. LONG. He does, my pet, I know he does, (Most excellent young man!) But, dearest, long ere you came out His daily calls began. MISS LONG. What mean you, Madam! MRS. LONG. Miss, I mean His Lordship is my friend— My Cicisbeo—my— in short, Your fancies, child, must end. MISS LONG. Madam! Mamma! what can you mean? He's not in love with you? I'll go and speak to my Papa— MRS. LONG. Do—if you dare, love, do! Your father's age, and gout, and bile, And half a hundred ills Keep him at home; I cannot stay To make him take his pills. And then in public, you must know, A man is indispensable. (Now listen, child, and dry your eyes— I always thought you sensible!) As for a ball—your father's far More fit for hearse and hatchment; And who can blame Platonic love And innocent attachment? MISS LONG. My heart will break! oh, 'tis enough To plunge me in despair, To give up such a nobleman! With such a head of hair! Besides, now don't be angry, Ma— When Pa to bed is carried, You've never time to talk to me— I should like to be married! MRS. LONG. Like to be married! so you shall; Yes, darling, to be sure— But not to Lord Fitzlackstiver, The amiable—but poor! Your husband shall have golden coin As countless as sea-sand; Yes, child, the Duke Filchesterton Has offer'd you his hand! MISS LONG. What do you say?—The Duke!—His Grace! A Duchess!—can it be! (He's sixty-five) how very odd That he should fix on me! The Duke!—(he can't have long to live) His Grace! when will he call? How lucky Lord Fitzlackstiver Meant nothing after all! The Duke!—he's very, very old; But what's that to his wife! You do not care three straws about My father's time of life. His Grace!—what gorgeous wedding clothes! What jewels I shall get! The diamonds of the family, (I'll have them all new set.) The Duke!—he can't live very long, His husky cough is chronic, And doubtless I shall find a friend Exceedingly platonic. You'll tell the Duke I'm flatter'd—pleased:— Oh! stop, Mamma—you'll see, Of course, that all his worldly goods Are settled upon me. A Duchess!—only think, Mamma, I shall be call'd your Grace! What had I best be married in, White satin or blond lace? Bless me! how very strange 'twill seem To have a spouse on crutches! I long to tell Fitzlackstiver That I'm to be a Duchess. Poor Fitz! It's well I'm not his wife; It would have made me ill, To go and make a fuss about Some odious butcher's bill. It never would have suited me To hash the boil'd and roast! And ascertain what eggs, and beer, And soap, and candles cost! Poor Fitz! don't let him marry, Ma— Oh, apropos of marriage! I must consult him when he calls, About my travelling carriage. The gout, they say, is apt to kill When vital parts it touches; Make haste, Mamma, and tell the Duke, That I will be his Duchess! IV. Scene—Hogsnorton House. MR. MRS. AND MISS HUM. MISS HUM. Oh, winter in Brighton, in Regency Square, Oh, winter in Brighton, the Court will be there! 'Tis not for myself that I ask it—oh! no, 'Tis for dear papa's health that I'm anxious to go. MRS. HUM. My dear, she is right, you should really arrange Some party of pleasure; you do want a change; For you just at present this place is too dull, Do winter at Brighton, for Brighton is full. MR. HUM. Oh, don't think of moving for my sake, my dear, You're really too anxious—I'm very well here. MISS HUM. Well! oh, my dear father! excuse me, you're wrong To sport with my feelings—go look at your tongue. MRS. HUM. Well! oh, my dear husband, you cannot disguise That terrible yellowness under your eyes! MR. HUM. Begone, ye two birds of ill omen! I see Through this sensitive, anxious, attention to me. If I am so delicate, why should I hear The noise that the sea makes at this time of year? You, Miss, and you, Madam, are trying by stealth To coax me to Brighton, by talking of health. I know what you want, Miss! and you, Madam, too— You want a gay season—yes, both of you do! MISS HUM. Papa, you're unkind; but I scorn to complain, In Hogsnorton House I'm content to remain. I did think the moving might do you some good; No matter—my motives are misunderstood; But even suppose that I did want a change, From stupid Hogsnorton, I'm sure it's not strange; You don't want to see me establish'd in life! Who'd come to Hogsnorton to look for a wife? MRS. HUM. Don't talk to your father—sweet girl, it's no use, He deems my solicitude all an excuse! I've nursed him, and watch'd him, and now he imputes— No matter—I'm silent, but all men are brutes! He deems me deceitful; you heard what he said— He'll be sorry enough perhaps when I'm dead! MR. HUM. Maria, don't cry! Leonora, for shame!— Ask any soul breathing if I am to blame! At Hogsnorton House there's my leather arm-chair, So cosey and snug—(only look at it there!) And then there's my cellar, my genuine wine, Without my old sherry I really can't dine. This house, too, is snug—and, pray, why should I lighten My purse for a gingerbread mansion at Brighton? Where, sleepless, you hear the perpetual din Of the tide going out, or the tide coming in. MRS. HUM. Nay, dearest, don't say so; the lodging shan't be In one of the terraces facing the sea; You'll sleep undisturb'd, love, in Regency Square; And how could you think I'd forget the arm-chair? I plann'd that all nicely, my dear; if we went, It was by the van to be carefully sent. And then too the wine, love, (how odd you and I Should think of the very same things, by the by!) Your genuine sherry I meant to have placed In hampers. You see, dear, I study your taste! MISS HUM. And, dearest papa, you and I will walk out, (You'll lean on my arm, and a fig for the gout;) You'll go to the library every day, And read all the papers in such a snug way. And don't you remember the shop on the Steyne? The pastrycook's shop kept by Phillips! I mean, The shop where you used to eat soup? MR. HUM. Very true, I almost can fancy I smell it—can't you? MRS. HUM. Yes, love, so delicious! And then, too, the chat And the whist at Sir Robert's—you don't forget that? MR. HUM. The whist? oh, that was very pleasant! MRS. HUM. Yes, very!— Shall Simpson have orders to pack up the sherry? MR. HUM. Egad!—but you're certain Sir Robert is there? MISS HUM. Oh, positive! When shall we pack the arm-chair? MR. HUM. I went there last year by the doctor's advice. That mulligatawny is certainly nice. The sherry may travel, 'tis true—and the chair— But Simpson must pack it with very great care. I think it may do me some good—so I'll write To Parsons to take me a lodging to-night. (Exit Mr. Hum.) MRS. HUM. There! did I not manage him well? I declare, Whilst I live, I shall doat on that darling arm-chair; A lucky idea, was it not?—and the wine? MISS HUM. Yes, mamma; and the soup was a good hit of mine. MRS. HUM. And the whist at Sir Robert's! The whist and the chat! MISS HUM. Sir Robert's in France, mamma— MRS. HUM. Never mind that! We'll vow we expected to meet him, and then We'll soon find out two or three humdrum old men. MISS HUM. And now, dear mamma, you're aware that I want A bonnet and gown. MRS. HUM. No, Maria, you can't— You really can't have a new bonnet, my dear; You've worn that so little I gave you last year; Your gowns too must serve for the present. MISS HUM. Ah! no— You cannot help sending to Carson. MRS. HUM. Why so? MISS HUM. Oh, really, mamma, though you do not want dress To set off your figure and face, I confess, Yet still I did see such a hat and pelisse! They'd suit you exactly, I never shall cease To wish that you had them! Cerulean blue! Send for them to please your Maria, pray do. MRS. HUM. My amiable daughter! I cannot refuse To send up to Carson. What gown will you choose? I'll order the blue for myself; and I think Your bonnet, my darling, had better be pink. LUNATIC LAYS. I. I MUST AND WILL AN ACTRESS WED. I must and will an actress wed, She'll smile away all shadows; The voice of Love is eloquent In green-rooms—not green meadows: Talk not of rural hills and vales, They suit my optic sense ill, The only scenery I prize Is that of Stanfield's pencil! The Earl, my father, storms at me, And says it is a queer age, When comic first appearances At last lead to the peerage. And my maternal Countess vows That nothing can console her, If I disgrace the family By marrying a stroller! But, oh! I'd scorn such prejudice, Although 'twere universal; For I have been behind the scenes At night, and at rehearsal. No titled heiress will I ask To be my benefactress; I'd rather elevate my wife, So I will wed an actress. Oh, first I burnt for tragic queens, My passion scarce is cool yet; I teased each Mrs. Beverley, Euphrasia, and Juliet; And if by Belvidera's frowns A little disconcerted, I flew to Mrs. Haller's side, And at the wings I flirted. But Colonel Rant, (the gentleman Who's always amateuring,) Behind the scenes came every night With language most alluring. And he had such a way with him, He won their hearts by magic, So I resign'd Melpomene, And Rant reigned o'er the tragic! To Lady Bells and Teazles next I turn'd—and Lady Rackets, Who put their rouge and spirits on (As boys put on their jackets); Whose smiles, professionally sweet, Appear when prompters summon; Who keep, in fact, their bloom for best, While sallow serves for common. And then I sigh'd for the soubrettes In aprons made with pockets, Who frisk about the stage like squibs, And then go off like rockets. But at their beck I always found Some beauteous Bob or Billy, With whom they lightly tript away, And left me looking silly. To prima donnas then I turn'd, The Pollys and Mandanes; Made love to she Don Carloses, And female Don Giovannis! But soon came one with higher notes— They left me—allegretto! They sought him—volti subito, Forsaking me—falsetto! But now a love for figurantes Within my bosom rankles, I doat upon extended arms, And sigh for well-turn'd ankles Enchanting girls! how dark their hair! How white and red their skin is! I love them all—though wicked wits May call them “spinning Jennies.” In Peter Wilkins I have sigh'd For sylph-like forms, whose trade is To hang suspended by the waist, And act high-flying ladies. The country curate may abuse My loves, because they lack dress, He'll choose a wife from private life;— But I will wed an actress. II. I WANT TO GO UPON THE STAGE. I want to go upon the stage And wear a wig and feathers; I envy each tragedian The laurels that he gathers. I'm sure that I could give effect To Richard's ruthful menace; Oh, would that I might black my face, And act the Moor of Venice! My father talks of what he calls Respectable employments. Condemning as Tom-fooleries My Thespian enjoyments. He calls me mouthing mountebank, And ranting rogue, and stroller; And not a servant in the house Compassionate my dolor! One day I stole a pot of rouge, And Aunt Jane's Sunday spencer; (She left me nothing in her will— How could I so incense her!) I flew to Cowes, where in a barn I found some kindred spirits. And soon I made the manager Appreciate my merits. He did announce me as a star: (He well knew what a star meant—) And I enacted Romeo In Aunt Jane's pink silk garment. My Juliet was a charming girl, A most delicious creature! With eyes—such eyes! and oh! her nose— I idolised the feature! Pink silk, with frogs was my costume, And her's was muslin spangled; And when the Nurse call'd her away, I wish'd she had been strangled. When we lay corpses side by side, A gentle squeeze she gave me, And whisper'd, “Wilt thou be my love?” I sigh'd, “Ay, if thou'lt have me!” But fathers they have flinty hearts, My angry father found me; Oh horrid night! methinks I see Scene shifters grinning around me! Alas! the scene they shifted not; The very pit seems full yet; I cannot tell the tragedy— He tore me from my Juliet! And since that inauspicious night, The stage I've never entered; In life's obscure realities My father's thoughts are centred. Misguided man! beneath his roof Now pines a slighted Roscius, Whose manhood pants to realise Youth's promises precocious. In tragic moods, I push my wig High up upon my forehead; I cork my eye-brows, and assume A stare that's very horrid. I roar a word or two, and then Speak low, you scarce can hear me; And then I thump my breast, ye gods, At Drury, how you'd cheer me! Genteelly comic I can be, And farcically sprightly; I'm excellent in pantomime, In ballet parts dance lightly. Were Mr. Lee, the new lessee, Aware of such a treasure, If I ask'd fifty pounds a-night, He'd give them me with pleasure. III. I MUST HAVE MUSIC. I must have music in my soul, Though envious tongues deny it. I'm very certain I've a voice, And spite of fate I'll try it. I'll practice morning, noon, and night, I'll buy the best instruction, I will abjure all solid food, If singers live by suction. I'll hold a note—'till you shall think That, very like a miser, I never mean to change that note, But you shall find I'm wiser: For you may fix on any key, Then name of notes one dozen, My spendthrift chest shall soon pour forth The treasure you have chosen. At present, up and down the scale, I run with zeal unwearied, Nor deviate into an air Till minor points are carried. When morning dawns, my task begins, At midnight hour it endeth, (Except those tasty intervals That man in eating spendeth.) But genius and the world are foes!— I have a hateful neighbour, A scientific man, forsooth! I scorn his plodding labour! He sends me messages, and says My noise distracts his study. My singing, noise! poor wretch, he knows Nought about taste—how should he? Two other neighbours, invalids, Who live on slops and dozing, Complain my singing wakes them up Just when their eyes are closing! I never sing till five o'clock, As if that could disturb them! I'll let my talents take their course, And scorn those who would curb them. One, (much too cold to estimate My talents in their true sense,) Did—oh it cuts me to the soul!— Indict me as a nuisance! I shook—but 'twas a vocal shake, Not one from terror springing, No judge could venture to assert I'm no great shakes at singing. Once came a crowd, a menial crowd, Crying: “There must be murder! We heard a female's horrid screams. Yes, hereabouts we heard her!” They climb'd the wall—they forced the door!— The ragamuffin sorte! They found me sitting all alone, And singing rather forte! I'll sing the air that Sontag sings, Rode's air with variations. My throat shall be the thoroughfare For all the new inflations. All styles I'll master—I'll outgrowl The trombone when I go low! And when in alt, Velluti's self Shan't sing so high a solo! IV. ADIEU, MY MOUSTACHIOS! Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! Lost, lost is the pride of my chin and my lip! His Majesty wills it, like Samson I'm cropt, And the killing career of Adonis is stopt! The razors are ruthless, my honours they nip! Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! Alas! what avails the loud clank of my spurs, What signify tassels, and feathers, and furs! The padding above, that the waist may look slim; The trowsers compress'd to exhibit the limb! My form I no longer exulting equip. Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! I know they deride a Commander who stoops To cull foreign fashions to deck British troops; But surely the biggest look rather more big In moustachios and tip—like a judge in his wig! I know I look small with my sword on my hip. Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! When Laura last saw me, she own'd that the world Contain'd no moustachios so charmingly curl'd; She thought my head foreign, and unlike the skull Of the money-bag mercantile fellow, John Bull. But now she will call me “contemptible rip!” Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! I went to the levee both pensive and pale— I felt like a puppy-dog robb'd of his tail! The Duke eyed me coldly, when notice I craved. Ah! would he had seen me before I was shaved! And as I kiss'd hands, I'm afraid I let slip, “Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip!” Ah! at a mess dinner, how graceful to dip My napkin, and wipe off the mess from my lip! The hair that grew on it was steep'd in each dish, And nourished by gravy—soup—sauces of fish. They are gone—and my claret I pensively sip. Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! They were red—and I died them—and now at the stain Which remains on the skin I scrub daily—in vain; The hair is shaved off, but a something is seen Which I fear may be thought to look rather unclean, I hope it don't look like a chimney-sweep's lip— Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! My principal reason, I frankly confess, For being a soldier at all—was the dress. The line on my lip, and the dot on my chin, Became me. The change is a horrid take in; I might just as well now have gone on board ship. Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! I know that they deem it unmanly to weep, So into half-pay I'll despondingly creep! The star of my beauty is lost in eclipse, I'll sit in reclusion and sigh for hair-lips! The tears down my nose now incessantly drip. Adieu, my moustachios! farewell to my tip! V. THE LAST WOMAN! I see him not, the man is gone! The man who watched my carriage; Oh! while I linger'd last but one, There still seem'd hopes of marriage. He too is off! alone I pine, A sad condition mine is, 'Tis very odd that one so fine, Should now prove fashion's finis. The desert Park! there is no show Of dames in silks that rustle; I look upon no titled beau, No beauty, and no bustle! Yet madly still that Park I seek, ('Twere far more wise to shun it.) Deep rouge upon my maiden cheek, Deep blonde upon my bonnet. My foot attracts not as I go One glance unto my liking; Though on my stockings, white as snow, The coloured clocks are striking. Spring flow'rs are gone, and autumn leaves Will strew my path hereafter, I laugh not—even in my sleeves, Though they seem made for laughter. The streets are thin, the squares are dull, The crowded hubbub ceases, And nothing now can be made full, But dresses and pelisses. Oh, Art! thine adventitious aid Is vain,—I ne'er approach man; I'm seen by no one but my maid, My pretty page, and coachman. And there's another bore! my page Is growing out of season; He's such a gawky for his age, I can't think what's the reason. I knew 'twas comme il faut in green The stripling to accoutre; But now, though he's but just fifteen, He looks like a sharpshooter. For scenes, where others rove, I fret, And then to cheer my own eye, A private box of mignonette I place on my balcony. Macadam frustrates these pursuits, The noise without he trebles; He tears the street up by the roots, And pounds it into pebbles. To be kept here so late, I vow, In tears of sorrow steeps me; The shopkeepers who see me now Are wondering what keeps me! I must contrive some moving plan, Or life I cannot drag on; I'll send my hat by Pickford's van, My bonnet by the waggon. Winged wardrobes every lady wants To waft her dresses neatly. My vapeur crape with séduisantes Will fill the boot completely. The imperial will hold my slip, (My maid shall pack it, poor thing!) The Morning Post shall print my trip, “Miss Crawl, from Batts' to Worthing.” VI. BIOGRAPHY. So mother Hubbard's dog's deceas'd, That spaniel of repute. Be mine the mournful task to write The memoirs of the brute. O'er all the authors of the day, Biographers prevail, I'll “point a moral” and adorn That little dead dog's tale. I'll sift the Hubbard family For anecdotes canine; The most minute particulars Shall very soon be mine. I'll bore the mournful dame herself With questions most abrupt, And first I'll learn, how, when, and where, His canine mother pupp'd. His puppyism I will trace, On Hubbard's apron rock'd, Describing when his tongue was worm'd, And how his ears were dock'd. His placid temper I will paint, And his distemper too, And all his little snappish tricks The public eye shall view. The dame and he were friends; 'tis thought She gave him bones and milk; And pattingly her hand smooth'd down His coat as soft as silk. But what of that?—The world shall know That he hath snarl'd at her; And that the dame hath kick'd the dog, And call'd him “nasty cur!” His love for her was cupboard love; The fawning which proclaims An instinct partiality For dog's meat—more than Dames. Alas! 'twas not l'affaire du cæur, An ingrate was the pup, Though oft his mistress for his meals Hath cut her liver up. And oft she did instruct the dog Upon his tail to sit, And elevate his two fore paws And beg a tiny bit. She plac'd the dainty on his nose, And counted “one”—“two”—“three!” And when he leapt and caught the prize, A happy dame was she! But I must tell of stolen joys, Of milk that hath been miss'd; Of hunted cats, and worried birds, I have a grievous list. Of rambles too with female dogs; Yet, hearing the old scratch, The dame to let the rover in Would rise, and lift the latch. In truth he was a naughty dog, Of habits very wild; He never yet was known to care One jot for wife or child. His wives were countless, each produced Nine bantlings at a birth; And some were drown'd, and some were left To rot upon the earth. But hold! is this my dead dog's tale? And can I not produce For naughtiness a friendly veil, For folly an excuse? And must the sage biographer Of little dogs and dames, Recall forgotten injuries, Snarls, kicks, and ugly names? The dog was a sagacious dog, That's all the world need know; The failings of the quadruped 'Tis not my task to show. His quarrels with his kith and kin, His puppy tricks when young, If these I tell, he'll seem far worse Than if I held my tongue. It shall be so: my tongue I'll hold, And not my grey goose quill; His death is recent—for a while Biographers be still. Contemporaries point at specks, But pause awhile, and then We may be sure posterity Will calmly hold the pen. But now to take away a life Each man of letters strives; The undertakers thrive by deaths, Biographers by Lives. O'er new made graves, thro' murky mists Of prejudice he jogs; And so it seems biography Is going—to the dogs! VII. THE FIRST WHITE HAT! I met a man in Regent Street, A daring man was he; He had a hat upon his head As white as white could be! 'Twas but the first of March!—away Three hundred yards I ran; Then cast a retrospective glance At that misguided man. I thought it might be possible To do so foul a deed, Yet not commit the murd'rous acts Of which too oft we read. I thought he might have felt distress: Have lov'd—and lov'd in vain— And wore that pallid thing, to cool The fever of his brain! Perchance he had no relative, No confidential friend, To say when summer months begin, And those of winter end. Perchance he had a wife, who was Unto his side a thorn, And who had basely thrust him forth To brave decorum's scorn! But no!—a smile was on his cheek; He thought himself the thing! And all unblushingly he wore The garniture of spring! 'Twas evident the man could not Distinguish wrong from right; And cheerfully he walk'd along, Unseasonably white! Then unperceiv'd I follow'd him, Clandestinely I tried To ascertain in what strange spot So queer a man could hide: Where he could pass his days and nights, And breakfast, dine, and sup; And where the peg could be, on which He hung that white hat up! He paused at White's—the white capotte Made all the members stare; He pass'd the Athenæum Club, He had no footing there! He stood a ballot once (alas! There sure was pique in that) Though they admit light-headed men, They blackball'd the white hat! And on he went self satisfied, And now and then did stop And look into the looking glass That lines some trinket shop; And smilingly adjusted it! 'Twas that that made me vext— “If this is borne,” said I, “he'll wear “His nankeen trowsers next!” The wretched being I at length Compassionately stopt, And us'd the most persuasive words Entreaty could adopt. I said his head was premature; I never left his side, Until he swore most solemnly The white hat should be dyed. VIII. MY SINECURE PLACE. How's this, my Lord Grey, can you mean what you say? Abolish all sinecures: pause, my Lord, pray! Oh, hear me, my Lord: is this really the case? Nay, do not take from me my Sinecure Place! Consider, my income is small for a peer. I'm poor, if you take my odd thousands a-year. Consider, I pray you, how ancient my race, Its dignity sinks with my Sinecure Place. My mansion in town has been lately rebuilt, Adorn'd with superb scagliola, and gilt. Pray, how shall I look Mr. Nash in the face, If you now put an end to my Sinecure Place? My castle must also be kept in repair; One month out of twelve I contrive to be there; One month I devote to the joys of the chase. My castle would go with my Sinecure Place! My cottage ornée, on the Devonshire coast, Must also be sold, if my place should be lost. Now, pray, my Lord, do reconsider my case, And let me retain my snug Sinecure Place. My lady her opera-box must discard! My lady, the beauty—you'll own 'twould be hard. My fortune won't pay for her feathers and lace; Then leave me, oh, leave me, my Sinecure Place! Economy may be discreet, I dare say, Retrenchment is all very well in its way; But there's no occasion for setting your face 'Gainst my individual Sinecure Place. You must, my Lord Grey, (it is time to be frank,) Uphold the importance of persons of rank! The aristocratic look up to your race, Support them, and leave me my Sinecure Place. If beggarly vagabonds will make a row, Be firm, and intimidate, no matter how. E'en flourish a sword in each vagabond's face; I'll do it myself for my Sinecure Place. I'll stipulate always to give you my vote— Whatever you dictate I'll utter by rote; Your notions—whate'er they may be—I'll embrace, And I'll do any job for my Sinecure Place. IX. JUNO'S SOIREE. Once Juno sent out cards, “at home,” to her own exclusive circle, She knew the leaders of high ton were sure to come at her call; She heav'd a sigh for Weippert's band, but checking her vexation, Engaged the music of the spheres as next in estimation. The Queen received the kindest gifts from ev'ry friendly neighbour: First Bacchus sent a pipe of wine, then Pan a pipe and tabor, Diana sent her fullest moon to light the upper regions, And Venus sent a brace of birds—(a pair of doves or pigeons.) The evening came, and Juno shone a blaze of regal beauty; Field Marshal Mars was pre-engaged on military duty; Three muses came—Mnemosyne, the very best of mothers, Ne'er took nine daughters out at once, so left at home the others. The sister Furies, boa clad, who thought themselves delightful, Declared they were quite grieved to see poor Venus look so frightful; The Graces danced a Saraband—Minerva thought them shocking, And Momus quizz'd her style of dress, and call'd her a blue stocking. Though not a son of Erin's Isle, yet Jupiter thought proper To make a Bull that day! ('twas while conversing with Europa); And Echo having caught the tale, did word for word reveal it, And Juno, tho' she bit her lips, pretended not to feel it. Supper was laid—as Gunter lays it where the most select are, And Jupiter bade Ganymede hand round the oldest nectar; Aurora was the first to hint that morning was not far off; And all the party said “Good day,” as Phœbus drove his car off. WEEDS OF WITCHERY. THE SEA PINK. I I've a yacht in the Island, the Sea Pink, of Ryde, Not a craft in the Club can be better; I own, when she goes very much on one side, I'm afraid that the wind will upset her. I belong to the Club, which is very genteel— We ne'er let a Scamp or a Shab in; But though it's the fashion, I own that I feel More at ease in my Cab than my Cabin! II 'Tis true, I know little of nautical ways, And less about charts of the ocean; And what's rather odd, on the quietest days I always grow queer with the motion! I've sunk a large sum on the toy, and 'tis well If the toy and I don't sink together: Oh! talking of sinking—nobody can tell What I suffer in very bad weather! III When I sigh for the land, Sailors talk of “sea room,” All sense of propriety lacking; And they gave me a knock-me-down blow with the boom. T'other day, in the hurry of tacking. I sported one morning a water-proof cap, And a Mackintosh—all India rubber; And a Sailor cried, “Jack, look at that 'ere queer chap, Did you ever see such a land-lubber?” IV What a bother the wind is! one day we were caught In a bit of a breeze in the offing; And we tack'd, and we tack'd, till I verily thought Every tack was a nail in my coffin! Cried one, “Never fear, we shall soon reach the shore,” (To me that word reach is pathetic!) I've heard of perpetual Blisters before, But I've an eternal emetic! V The Captain and Crew are of course in my pay, I expect them to pay me attention; But they push me about, and they now and then say Little words it would shock me to mention! The smell of the tar I detest, and I think That the sea-breeze quite spoils the complexion, But the ladies all say, when they've seen the Sea Pink, That her Owner's the Pink of Perfection. THE POPPY. I “Oh proud am I, exceeding proud, I've mustered the Elite! I'll read them my new Tragedy—no ordinary treat; It has a deeply-stirring plot—the moment I commence, They'll feel for my sweet heroine an interest intense; It never lags, it never flags, it cannot fail to touch, Indeed, I fear the sensitive may feel it over much. But still a dash of pathos with my terrors I combine, The bright reward of tragic Bard—the laurel will be mine! II “Place chairs for all the company, and, Ma'am, I really think If you don't send that child to bed, he will not sleep a wink; I know he'll screech like anything before I've read a page. My second act would terrify a creature of that age: And should the darling, scared by me, become an imbecile, Though flatter'd at the circumstance—how sorry I should feel! What! won't you send the child to bed? well, Madam, we shall see;— Pray take a chair, and now prepare the laurel crown for me. III “Have all got pocket-handkerchiefs? your tears will fall in streams; Place water near to sprinkle over any one who screams. And pray, good people, recollect, when what I've said controls Your sympathies, and actually harrows up your souls; Remember, (it may save you all from suicide, or from fits,) 'Tis but a mortal man who opes the flood-gates of his wits! Retain your intellects to trace my brightest gem, (my moral) And, when I've done, I'm very sure you'll wreathe my brow with laurel. IV “Hem—Act the first, and scene the first—a wood—Bumrumptienters— Bumrumpti speaks, ‘And have I then escaped from my tormentors? Revenge! revenge! oh, were they dead, and I a carrion crow, I'd pick the flesh from off their bones, I'd sever toe from toe! Shall fair Fryfritta, pledged to me, her plighted vow recall, And wed with hated Snookums, or with any man at all! No—rather perish earth and sea, the sky and—all the rest of it— For wife to me she swore she'd be, and she must make the best of it.’” V Through five long acts—ay, very long, the happy Bard proceeds; Without a pause, without applause, scene after scene he reads! That silent homage glads his heart! it silent well may be: Not one of all his slumbering friends can either hear or see! The anxious Chaperon is asleep! the Beau beside the fair! The dog is sleeping on the rug! the cat upon the chair! Old men and babes—the footman, too! oh, if we crown the Bard, We'll twine for him the Poppy wreath—his only fit reward. FORGET MY KNOT. I Forget my knot? forget my knot! Oh, that I may defy! Where'er you are, I'll haunt the spot, Still pointing to the tie. II All other ties may loosen'd be, But mine must last till death! And you I'll taunt incessantly, Until I'm out of breath. III Each day delay on some pretence Was artfully extended; And so, to finish my suspense, Myself I have suspended. IV At Hymen's altar, altered Fair, You were a false defaulter; And so, to end my deep despair, I add an H to alter! V I could not live to hear you scoff, Too fascinating elf; So, when I found you turned me off, I did turn off myself! VI No scissors will avail; we part— On human aid I frown; And though you cut me to the heart, You shall not cut me down. VII I strive your inmost soul to grind, And, if I strive in vain, Hang me, if I for womankind E'er do the like again. VIII They'll call me suicidal, Because this knot I tied; When Jack is dead, let Sue recall How for his Sue he sigh'd! IX To do this melancholy thing, Your garters I have got. Adieu, false Sue, you'll have your swing; And then—Forget my knot! WATER LILIES. I A boat, a boat, an open boat, On “the sea, the sea, the open sea!” If e'er ye have been thus afloat, There's nought could match your misery. II Pale Water Lilies, you'd suppose Poor ladies, when such boats they enter; The cheek, the pallid leaf; the nose, The spot of yellow in the centre! III Such Lilies, “pining on the stem,” Or on the stern, are more or less ill; The smell of tar is bad to them, And worse the pitching of the vessel. IV The spray, alas! no jasmine spray! Is weighing down each best new bonnet; The hair is out of curl; to-day, The sea has all the curl upon it. V Old Ocean! thou art much too old, To be so rough and so unsteady; Is this now—may I make so bold— A fit reception for a lady? VI Shallow thou'rt not; then recollect, All this may seem more deep than clever. Be calm awhile, and thou'lt reflect; Don't play at pitch and toss for ever. WALLFLOWERS. “They call us Wall-flowers, my dear! Because we spend the evening here, All in a row against the wall, Ne'er noticed by the men at all!” “I'm sure it is no fault of ours, We do not wish to be Wallflowers; Not one of us that has not wanted To be by somebody transplanted: It never was our choice at all To sit here ranged against the wall; But, if the men, devoid of taste, Will leave us here our sweets to waste, Selecting silly pinks and roses, To make their hymeneal posies, 'Tis very fit that here we sit, And innocently chat a bit.” “Look at Miss Rose, she's just come in, Some people rave about her skin! Her clear complexion! (how absurd!) You know I never say a word, But this I will say—(how she's scented!) I always thought the Roses painted.” “And here I vow's Miss Violet; I ne'er could find her beauty yet. And how they praise her! what a fuss! Think of preferring her to us! A little, dingy, paltry fright! And what a gown for candlelight!” “Do see the Miss Carnations, there— Not two alike, I do declare— They're showy, but my sister thinks They are so like those little Pinks; You see the likeness? to be sure; The Pinks we never could endure.” “See, from the valley comes Miss Lily! Another beauty,—oh, how silly! White as a sheet, and so petite, No wonder we are obsolete! For Wallflowers truly she's no fellow— Men once were fond of brown and yellow!” CHICK WEEDS. I “My dear, stay here! I'm quite in fear, Unless you all keep very near; My group's a little bit too large; Nine daughters are so great a charge: And though I know, where'er we go, The people think us quite a show; They say—(I hate satiric tricks) Look at the hen and her nine chicks! II “Oh! there's Sir Charles; I'm certain he Will wed one of the family; And should he choose, let none refuse, He's not at all the match to lose. No wonder that he can't decide Which daughter shall become his bride. My charming girls, I'm bound to say, Are all so perfect in their way. III “Don't stoop like that, my sweetest Rose; Maria, dear, turn out your toes; It gives me pain, my angel Jane, To see your squint come back again! Ann, what can make your nose so red? Constantia, do hold up your head; I wish Kate's ancles weren't so thick; Bess, keep your mouth shut, there's a chick! IV “How are you, dear Sir Charles? so near— Your praises did you overhear? All female hearts you seem to touch; My sweet girls praise you over much: Kate in particular; poor Kate Has looked a leetle pale of late— Nay, now so red! why whisper ‘Hush!’ What have I said to make her blush? V “You'll come to tea, Sir Charles? you'll see A most harmonious family. Bess plays the lute, Ann the guitar, Jane learns the harp of sweet Labarre; Rose and Maria, if they're prest, Make use of Broadwood's very best; Constantia sings, indeed we all Love music. You are musical?” VI “I'm musical,” Sir Charles replied, And took his hat, and hem'd, and sigh'd; “I'm musical, and charmed to view Such harmony. Dear Ma'am, adieu. Oh what an orchestra for me, Could I wed all the family. Farewell—temptation let me shun, 'Twould spoil the band to marry one.” THE HARE BELLE. I No Hare Belle for me when the harriers run— If a lady pursue them, that lady I shun: When she leaves her own door, bring her shawl and her clogs If she follow the hounds, she may go to the dogs. II Away with the Hare Belle—the leaps that I see, No thought of a lover's leap wakens in me; For a gate of five bars will most certainly prove An effectual bar to my being in love. III Away with the Hare Belle, her habit, and hat; No lady shall win me with habits like that; Bear Blue Belle and Hare Belle far hence o'er the flood; The first with her study, the last with her stud! IV Away with the Hare Belle, when fair lips I see Discoursing of coursing sounds coarsely to me; And the smack that I doat upon (talking of lips) Is not, I assure you, the smacking of whips. JOHN QUILL. I John Quill was clerk to Robert Shark, a legal man was he, As dull, obscure, and technical as legal man could be; And, perch'd before his legal desk, Quill learnt the legal rules That give high principles to all who sit upon high stools. John Quill with skill could doubt distil where all before was clear, One would suppose that he was born with a pen behind his ear. Though merely clerk to Robert Shark, so great was his address, That many really thought J. Q. as knowing as R. S. II John Quill, however small the job, huge drafts of deeds could draw, A puzzle quite to common sense, according to the law; With vulgar, vile tautology to indicate his skill, He did “enlarge, prolong, extend, and add unto” the bill! And thus he did “possess, obtain, get, have, hold, and enjoy” The confidence of Robert Shark, who called him worthy boy. Birds of a feather were the pair, the aim of both their breasts, To pluck all others, plume themselves, and feather their own nests. III But 'tis a theme too dark for jest; oh! let him who embarks Upon the troubled waters of the law—beware of Sharks; And such my dread of legal Quills, I readily confess That Quills of “fretful porcupine” would terrify me less. When poor men seek a legal friend, the truth the fable tells, The lawyer eats the oyster up, the client has the shells; And could the shells be pounded to a palatable dinner, The legal friend might swallow that, and clients might grow thinner. CORN FLOWERS. I “The weather will change,” cries my Lady, in pain, “My feet are in torture, I'm sure there'll be rain; The Admiral whispered he'd take me in tow, And he glanced at my feet as he said it, I know: But now down at heel must my slipper be worn! 'Twill end in a cut—Oh, this horrible corn!” II A tight fit from Hoby the Captain has got, Engaged to walk out with Miss Laura Lamotte, But oh! in his boot a barometer lies! His corn a sad change in the weather implies; To limp is distraction! “Oh! why was I born? In the flower of my youth I'm cut up by a corn!” III The Belle is preparing to grace the Race Ball, Her foot is in anguish, her shoe is too small! So partial to dancing, what is to be done? How horrid the hopping and carrying one! Cinderella's famed slipper of glass might be worn As a weather-glass now! what a terrible corn! IV There's a moral in this which is found without trouble; The light step of youth may get into a hobble. The shoe may be silken, the sole may be thin, While the soul of the wearer is tortured within; Where roses are sweetest most sharp is the thorn, And Terpsichore's harvest is—cutting a corn! BULL RUSHES. I The Fancy Fair! The Fancy Fair! The fair I fancy governs there; And fairest of the fair is she Who don't deny she fancies me. Among the fair sex, recollect Fair dealings you must not expect; Whatever trash is to be sold, They give no change for notes or gold! II Each stall by some fair dame is graced, Her store of toys before her placed: And as mere traders, lest they fail To raise the wind, must puff the sale. So with these trading amateurs A sigh attracts, a smile allures; And can young men pay down too much For trifles hallow'd by their touch? III What fills the traders with affright? What puts the customers to flight? Why is the scene so sadly changed? A Bull, exceedingly deranged, Alarms the fairest of the fair! Bull rushes here, Bull rushes there! No wonder each sweet voice he hushes— 'Tis a toss up where Mad Bull rushes! DEADLY NIGHTSHADE. I I lay within a strange abode, and on a curtain'd bed, The lamp upon the tapestry a ghastly glimmer shed; I could not doze, I could not sleep, I heard the rats and mice; My head was like a furnace, and my hands and feet like ice. I thought of all my evil deeds, and wished them all undone, I longed to hear the merry lark, and see the rising sun; I heard the hooting of the owl, the ticking of the clock, And the door did shake, while something seem'd to fidget with the lock! II I wanted much to ring the bell to summon man or maid, I did not thrust a finger forth because I was afraid; I longed to call out lustily, but not a word I said, I grasped the blankets and the sheets, and held them o'er my head. I heard a most alarming noise, I never heard the like, Just as the turret-clock struck twelve! a horrid hour to strike! And down my chimney screeching came a most malignant fiend— I sat up trembling in my bed—good gracious, how he grinn'd! III Upon the marble mantelpiece there flared a globe of flame! And in it danced distorted forms, too horrible to name! And on the hearth the fiend still sat—I fainted with affright! But rose next morn to trace the cause the moment there was light. The fiend was but a tabby cat; the globe of flame I saw, A shade of paper for the lamp—such as my sisters draw! 'Twas traced with ghosts and skeletons from charnel-houses damp! It isn't nice to have a Deadly Nightshade for one's lamp! HEARTS-EASE. I I've peeped at Parisian bowers, I've rambled to Naples and Rome; But weary of costlier flowers, I now gather HEARTS-EASE at home: No hotbed henceforth shall be tried, It grows best by my own fireside. II I think a fat man is a fool, Who goes voyaging and coaching about; The foreigners call him John Bull, As if all the English were stout! In London I'm sure people stare, I'm a great curiosity there! III At Dover they rumpled my best coat, And swore, like unmannerly brutes, I had contraband lace in my waistcoat, And Eau de Cologne in my boots! In vain I cried, “Why will you doubt me? I've nought unsubstantial about be.” IV My bootmaker yearly enlarges His bill, with the growth of my calf; And my tailor increases his charges And books me “a coat and a half!” He can't raise my small-clothes, how can he? Small clothes! why I never wear any! V My friend Doctor Camomile offered To cure my rheumatic attack; But he laughed when I said that I suffered A pain in the small of my back! Ah me! he did nothing but quiz it: “The small of your back! pray where is it?” VI If ever they put me in fetters, My bondage eternal must be; For if they enlarge other debtors, I'm sure they will not enlarge me! They'll make light of my claims if they will, Yet I shall look big at them still. VII Young Cupid will never o'ertake me, No, no, I must pine on the shelf; If ever I'm match'd, he must make me A Fatima fat as myself. But never again will I roam, I'm content with my Hearts-ease at home. VIII I'm sure I don't envy the lovers Of sport, though inactive and lame; I've not far to go for the covers, Under which the Cook places my game; Three courses I manage myself, And I've got my preserves on a shelf! IX In France, for this exquisite dinner, A nap. they would charge me at least; But here, after all, I'm a winner, A nap I secure by the feast. And of the past dreaming, at last, Recollection becomes a repast! X My dogs either beg a tit-bit, Or curl themselves up on the rug; And I in my easy chair sit, Luxurious, silken, and snug: And my HEARTS-EASE I trust is secure, For I have not forgotten the poor. THE RECTORY. BOOK I. CANTO I. The lady's boudoir! who shall dare To paint that scene of her seclusion, Where chosen treasures, rich and rare, Deliberately placed with care, Are meant to imitate confusion. The rosewood tables to excess With porcelain and chrystal strew'd, (As if to hint that awkwardness Must never venture to intrude). The escrutoire, the pen of gold, The scented wax, the tinted paper, The silver Cupid doom'd to hold The little pink transparent taper. The sun-flower clock—(whose dial well May represent the golden flower, Mechanically made to tell, In poetry, the passing hour) Some volumes too, in bindings such As fairest fingers love to touch, The Annuals in silken sets, Lightest of literary pets. The flowers, that seem as if they were Thrown idly, negligently, there; But all so tastefully arranged, That were one little blossom changed, The fragrant group at once would lose Its charm, the harmony of hues. Say, can a mortal maid presume To venture here with mop and broom? No, surely while the menials sleep, Good fairies nightly vigils keep; They dust each fragile ornament, Replenish ev'ry vase with scent, Wind up the clock, fold scented paper In forms of spells to light the taper. They lave each precious China dish, And feed the gold and silver fish. The lady's boudoir! Who shall trace The tout ensemble of the place? And there the Lady sits upon The easiest of easy chairs, And murmurs in a pensive tone One of last season's opera airs. She starts, as if the melody Had roused her from her reverie: She rises, to the window goes, And pulls aside the muslin curtain. And sighs, for very well she knows That day's imprisonment is certain: She nothing sees but leafless trees, And snow flakes borne upon the breeze, No ride, no walk; the thought was vain, The muslin curtain fails again. She stirs the fire, yet who can doubt She is unconscious of the action? She very nearly puts it out, In her intenseness of abstraction! And now she sits again, and leans Upon her hand her beauteous brow, And meditates on distant scenes, And friendly faces absent now. At length the feelings that were pent So long in silence find a vent; With no one in her solitude To answer what she may advance, She leaves her meditative mood And thus her thoughts find utterance: “I'll ask him—why should I defer One moment making the proposal? And should he stingily demur, Uncourteously refusing her, To whom in point of fact he owes all, I am not worse off than before. I'll ask; though asking is a bore: And I an heiress! there's the sting! I should have paus'd, had I conjectured That I could ask for any thing, With such a dread of being lectured: I'm sure I thought that heiresses When married, always were looked up to, And treated as divinities, Whom it was man's first thought to please, And kneeling—hold out pleasure's cup to. Heigho! I'll ask him.” And she goes To the study of Sir Hampton Rose. I've breath'd his name! and so already The reader knows this lonely lady; The Lady Hampton Rose—so well Remember'd as a reigning belle, Who married, twenty years ago, A Baronet whose purse was low. And time who frequently displaces The tints that females fain would fix, Has left her full of bloom and graces, Fat, very fair, and thirty-six. But let us follow to the door, Where now reluctantly she lingers, Half leaving it; and now once more Touching the lock with trembling fingers, She knocks and gently cries “My dear Sir Hampton—answer—are you here?” And may we pause to ask the cause Why Time that should make fond ties stronger, Thus oft a chilling barrier draws 'Twixt hearts that beat like one, when younger? Alas! what seeming trifles lead To such a mutual change of feeling, So unimportant, that indeed We scarcely miss the links they're stealing: And yet those several links combined Form the light fetters of affection, Uniting lovers, heart and mind, But which in married life we find, Oft only live in recollection! The confidence unlimited, The eyes that seem by intuition, Before a single word is said, To guess, and answer each petition: Ah! why do such things pass, and why The heart's exclusive fond devotion? And leave the inattentive eye, The cold, or querulous reply, The longing after locomotion! There have been mortals, and there are Less changeable and happier far, Who share the summer days of life As lovers still, though man and wife: And when misfortune's frowning form Comes near them with her wintry weather, They cling, like children in a storm, More closely, lovingly, together. These boast a bliss (oh well I know The truth of what I say) Which fortune never can bestow, And never take away. But I digress, and I confess This habit carried to excess Is very wrong, and we return The Lady's cause of care to learn. 'Tis evident we are too late To hear her open the debate. The lady leans back in her chair, By her own eloquence exhausted, Yet looks with a triumphant air At him so fluently accosted; As if she meant to say: “Now answer, Yes, and refuse me if you can, Sir!” Sir Hampton Rose was one of those Provoking men, of looks so mild, That any body would suppose They might be manag'd by a child. And when they say an angry word, A voice all gentleness is heard; And while the calm eyes acquiesce, And with the placid cheeks say “yes,” The tongue is very apt to give A most decided negative. He had a tantalizing way Of listening to all you say, Or rather seeming so to do, And looking calmly up at you With such a smile, that your success is Apparently beyond a doubt; Yet when you finish, he confesses He is not able to make out What your long speeches are about! E'en now he heard his lady speak, With that tranquillity of cheek, Which made his words the more provoking. “Are you in earnest, love, or joking?” But Lady Rose's glance possest No indication of a jest, When thus Sir Hampton she addrest: “You know I am in earnest, (pray Don't smile in that unmeaning way) My wishes very well you know. (I'm sure my temper is a miracle!) I've told you where I wish to go— (Don't look so hideously satirical.) For eighteen months we have been here, And really at this time of year, This mansion is so very triste, So very sombre!” “Not the least. It is a very charming spot; And you were born here, were you not? Pray don't apologize, my love, I find no fault with Granby Grove. 'Twas mine the day I married you, Your maiden name was Granby too. Trifles seem therefore precious here; Don't call it sombre, don't, my dear.” “‘My dear,’ indeed! that's too absurd!” “My Lady, then: is that the word? Or may I use your christian name? Laura! I'm surely not to blame For checking you when you disparage Your own estate, love—mine by marriage.” “'Tis yours,” her Ladyship replied, “'Tis yours, it cannot be denied; 'Tis yours, and yet I dearly love Each little twig of Granby Grove. Those twigs were mine, oaks, beeches, firs, All planted by my ancestors. But when you thought it worth your while To take me and my twigs—(don't smile), I little thought that I should be Myself as rooted as a tree, With no amusement, nothing new; My daily walk the avenue; My most exciting avocation To watch the course of vegetation; Upon the little twigs to see The spring buds in their infancy, And watch them still, till each receives Its summer modicum of leaves. My autumn pastime to discern How very yellow leaves can turn; My winter—misery!—to fix My eyes on trees transform'd to sticks!” But a matrimonial duet In an awkward key is sometimes set; And though the two performers may Be quite in earnest with their airs, Let a third person steal away And go and mind his own affairs. They often touch discordant chords, Make use of inharmonious words, With voices rais'd too high to be Compatible with melody. We may remark the female voice Is always highest reckon'd; And in the duos of her choice The man sings always second. And thus it is when man and wife Step on the boundaries of strife; The moral or satiric pen Should touch the paper lightly then; And though it may be well to state The aim, and end of the debate, (Just as at distance, we might get A note or two of the duet, And know to what tune it is set). Yet if the argument—or song Grows very loud as well as long, We, knowing what 'tis all about, Should leave the parties, right or wrong, To sing it—or to talk it out. What arguments the lady us'd, How long the gentleman refus'd, The many tears the former shed, The many words the latter said, The pros enforced with so much skill, The ready cons that met them still, These to my muse are things occult, She hastens on to the result. A spring in town was what she wanted; A spring in town at length is granted! Sir Hampton has a wicked way Of saying “no” for the sake of saying it, Though all the time perhaps he may Mean to say “yes.”—Yet half the day He'll shake his head at what you say, And spoil concession by delaying it. When Lady Rose had work'd herself Into an unbecoming rage, He took a volume from a shelf, Deliberately read a page, And then look'd up with that calm smile Which ne'er had left him all the while, And said: “perhaps you'll like to know “I always meant that we should go.” A man may sneer at female reasons For longing after London seasons, But happy Lady Rose, thy Lord Turns thither of his own accord; Thou mightst have argued all day long, Until exhaustion made thee stop, Urging that parents must be wrong Who let their old connexions drop; Thou mightst have said thy son and heir Was old enough to see society, Or that thy daughter young and fair Might be presented with propriety. Or secretly thou mightst have had Visions of thine own beauty clad In robe de bal (of Carson bought;) At Almack's too—too flattering thought! Or smiling forth with braided locks From a best circle opera box.— This never would have done; amusement Offers Sir Hampton no inducement, Unless the amusement chance to be One of his own selection; And then indeed assuredly He could see no objection. And long he furtively hath eyed The hobby that he means to ride, (And pleasing is that hobby's pace To those who never tried her, Though in the amble or the race She's apt to throw her rider). Ambition! (understand me, pray), Ambition in a quiet way, Not of that very lofty kind Which sighs for reputation's “bubble,” Till to his keeping are consign'd Responsibilities, that grind The powers of body and of mind With “double, double toil and trouble.” Not so: Sir Hampton had, in short, (Or thought he had) a friend at court, A cousin in the Cabinet; And though twas long since they had met, And though not very clearly knowing What recompense he hoped to get, He thought he should be right in going At once, and to the courtier shewing His relative the Baronet. He was aware that the relations Of men in public situations, Instead of pocketing vast sums, Can scarcely pick up paltry crumbs, Since unenlighten'd eyes persist In peering at the pension list. And Ladies Jane no longer young, From Peers right honourably sprung, Must now give up, oh sad reverse! Their income from the public purse; A stinted pittance to receive Wrung from some noble relative, Who thinks the public ought to grant A pretty income to his aunt; Not much—sufficient to enable The dame to keep a social table, Champagne, and customary courses, A house in town, landau and horses. And sinecure (which when translated, Without a cure once seem'd to mean) Is now an evil so abated, That those who for snug things have waited With lengthen'd visages are seen: And those who really used to hug Things most inestimably snug, And to their annual thousands add Another—perhaps two, to add, The gift of some most noble cousin, Who thus hath delicately chosen His own relations to assist, And sop their daily bread with honey, By putting them upon the list Of those who drain the public money. They know the cure is nearly finished, And talk, with incomes much diminished, About “the good old times,” and sigh, Relinquishing a luxury! Oh! who would bear the degradation Of being pension'd on the nation? Who, that already has enough To buy an independent loaf, Such stipend would consent to take, To turn the loaf into a cake? Or who that goes on foot to-day, Erect upon the King's highway, So meanly, despicably feels A gilded carriage he'd prefer, If he must be a pensioner, E'er he can buy the toy on wheels! Mistake me not, it would be hard If those who struggle through the strife, The ceaseless toil of public life Were grudg'd their well deserv'd reward. Not so—the pensioners I mean Are useless beings I have seen, Without one talent that can claim For them publicity of name, Yet who have thus been public debtors; And yet a look of pride they wear, A high, aristocratic air! As if their independent neighbours, Who earn their incomes by their labours, The apothecary and the lawyer, Who must bow down to their employer, Were not beyond compare their betters! But I digress, and I confess This habit carried to excess Is very, very wrong, and so I said at least an hour ago. Sir Hampton has with Granby Grove Five thousand pounds a year, Means adequate for those who love In a provincial scene to move, But not enough, I fear, For such as fain would shine in this Luxurious metropolis; But then, Sir Hampton Rose expected That, being very well connected, He might engage a residence, From rents exorbitant refraining, And live at moderate expense. More entertain'd than entertaining. In fact, he thought if he could meet A small abode in Baker Street, Or Gloucester Place, or any where Contiguous to Portman Square, Or in another distant quarter, Now strew'd all over brick and mortar, Cadogan Place, or Eaton Crescent, Or Sloane Street, more remote than pleasant; Where'er in fact his home might be, He thought that he should daily see The cards of the nobility; And an engagement book o'erflowing With all the very best things going. This was a secondary thought; What higher things Sir Hampton sought, He nam'd to none; and Lady Rose Now to her boudoir gaily goes. And whilst her own maid Jane, displaying Her skill, adjusts her evening gown, She half distracts the girl by saying: “Next Monday week we go to town.” CANTO II. Sweet is the earliest breath of spring, the unexpected ray, That peeping out throws warmth upon a February day; We hail the lengthen'd hours of light, the softness of the breeze, And almost wonder why we see no leaves upon the trees. And here and there upon the earth the crocuses are seen, The golden buds that nestle in their cradles of light green, And snowdrops delicate and pale, that droop, as if in fear Of coming from their warm repose so early in the year. And there's a path at Granby Grove, where the earliest spring day Shines forth, as if March meant to steal the livery of May; The first of birds assembled there rehearse their summer song. And a rivulet flows murmuring melodiously along. Oh! rivulets, bright rivulets, ye are the gentle friends Of him upon whose lonely walk no human form attends; And as he sits beside ye, with a soft and soothing tone, Your voices seem to speak to him of joys for ever gone. Ye call up other voices too, unheard for many years, And ye give to him who mourns the dead—the luxury of tears. How often have we heard it said, that in December days The lonely being loves his hearth's companionable blaze! But rivulets, bright rivulets, when social hearths are dim, The mourner seeks your mossy banks, ye are the friends for him. Upon the path that I have nam'd, two youthful lovers stood And seem'd to watch the rivulet in meditative mood. But I must pause to sketch them both: the girl was seventeen; A form and face so beautiful but seldom has been seen. Her name was Mary, and there was a something when she smil'd About her lips, that told you she was Lady Rose's child. A lurking laughter-loving look; but in her nobler face A high expression dwelt, of which her mother had no trace, A touch of sentiment and thought: you read as in a book Whatever mischief might betide that laughter-loving look, That still, within her secret soul lay principles so pure, That in temptation Mary Rose could ne'er be insecure. Her lips were red, her eyes were blue, her skin extremely fair, In ringlets o'er her snowy brow she wore her light brown hair; In ringlets, art's most pleasing style, for ringlets oft run wild Round nature's sweetest dwelling place, the features of a child, Not coiffée'd by a cruel hand—not strain'd into a load Of hard and heavy looking bows, perhaps the latest mode, Invented surely by some fiend, who fain would thus displace (No very practicable task) the charm of woman's face. Slight was her fairy figure, as her mother's might have been, When first she knew Sir Hampton Rose, a bride at scarce sixteen. And Mary by her lover stands, and seems as if in dread That she had hurt his feelings by some rash word she had said. This lover was her cousin—a distant one of course, But cousin is a weighty word—few people know its force. A first, perhaps a second cousin, Ladies need not dread— But if you have one more remov'd—remember what I've said. He'll talk of his relationship—but 'tis a ship he'll sink, The moment it occurs to him love forms a better link. Each day he'll walk, each day he'll talk, and every day you'll see A hundred little things that prove how pleasant he can be; When trifles try to win a smile, he'll step before a dozen, And whisper, while you laugh and say: “He only is my cousin;” And at a pic-nic party, when prudent parents seek To keep all gay adventurers and younger sons in check, They always have this ready mode of ending the quandary: “Oh let us send for cousin Edward, he'll take care of Mary.” And Mary's cousin Edward was a cousin of this kind; Unlimited companionship their hearts had closely twin'd. In all the sorrows of her youth—ten minutes would suffice To take her to the Rectory for comfort and advice. In all her little charities, the same judicious voice Would name to her the pensioners most worthy of her choice. Her chamber too at Granby Grove was chosen for its view, Though other chambers had a more extensive one, 'tis true; But as she sat there, she could see the tower of the church With the gable of the Rectory, and its ivy-mantled porch. But Edward was no Rector; the reader must be told That he was left an orphan boy, at only six years old. His father was a younger son, his mother poor as fair, To virtue and good looks in fact their only child was heir, And heir, alas! to little else. But in our early years A kind hand seldom tries in vain to wipe away our tears, And poverty is then unfelt; we cannot have been taught How many worldly smiles by worldly riches must be bought. At Granby Edward found a home, and Mary and her brother In striving to amuse him seem'd to rival one another. Mary was then three years of age, and little Edward tried To teach her how to run about, protecting her with pride; And as they older grew, their task, their sports were still the same, For Mary left her governess, and to the boys she came To help her brother wend his kite, or look at Edward's boat Which down the little rivulet in gallant trim would float. And when the lads to college went, Miss Mary used to think That writing to her brother John was wicked waste of ink; He was a correspondent so abominably dull. But Edward always answered her, and his letters were so full Of kind remarks and pleasant news, no trifle was forgotten, She read them over every night, and put them by in cotton. Oh what a beauteous thing is love! how happy and how pure, Thus springing up in two young hearts, from present ills secure, Assuming Friendship's name, it quite forgets that friends must sever, As if young cousins thro' the world walk'd hand in hand for ever. A fountain in a lonely vale resembles such a dream: Now nothing but the clear blue sky is mirror'd in the stream, Beside the valley's loveliest path its infancy is led, Its bank is lined with violets, with softest moss its bed. But the stream must leave the lonely vale, the violets and the moss, And struggle on into the world, where restless billows toss. Its purity reflects no more the bright expanse above, And the calmness of its course is lost.—Oh! is't not so with Love? By the Curate's side stood Mary Rose, unwilling to discuss Some painful subject—suddenly he broke the silence thus:— “Forgive me, Mary, oh! forgive the selfishness of heart That would detain you longer here, 'tis time that we should part. I might have known it could not last, I might have known that bliss So pure, so perfect, n'er was meant for such a world as this. And Mary, I will own to thee, that in some pensive mood The thought of being torn from thee unbidden would intrude; But I have hush'd the warning voice, I drove the thought away, I knew that we must part, but still put off the evil day; And in thy presence soon forgot that such a day must come. But why do I distress thee thus? my anguish should be dumb; It shall be so; yes—though I break my heart by the endeavour, Henceforth I'll utter no complaint. Farewell! farewell for ever!” “For ever! Edward, 'tis unkind. For ever!” Mary said, “Oh think when first you went from home, what bitter tears I shed; But I never breathed such cruel words: I plac'd implicit trust Upon a friend's fidelity—shall Edward be less just? You said you would remember me, and did I not believe? I promised I would write to you, and did I then deceive? No, Edward, no, we met again as happy as before, And, dearest cousin, even now we've happy days in store.” “Say, Cousin, yes, that word they will not bid thee to forget— Say Cousin, but we never more shall meet as we have met. Ay, call me Cousin in the world, it surely will be hard If thou mayst not bestow on me a cousin's cold regard. But I renounce the chilling word.” “Oh, Edward, say not so; Thou'rt angry, Edward; let me hear kind words before I go.” “Kind words! I know not what I say; but novice as thou art In worldly ways, consider, is it thus that cousins part? Were I thy cousin only, at the altar I could stand And calmly breathe a blessing while a husband press'd thy hand. But is it so? no, Mary, no—thou canst not be my wife, And the loneliness of blighted hope is Edward's lot for life. Alas! I never loved thee with the common love of earth, The love that vaunts its proud success in revelry and mirth. My love was nurs'd in secret, like a blossom that has furl'd All its sweet leaves from the notice and the sunshine of the world.” Mary was weeping while he spoke; at length she rais'd her head, And looking in his face, almost inaudibly she said: “Edward, you never spoke of this—and have we not been wrong? Yes, both of us, to close our eyes against the truth so long. And now that you address me thus, perhaps I should rely On some more tranquil prompter than my heart for a reply; But no, if you have been to blame, at least that blame I share, And I cannot listen calmly to those accents of despair. If you are wretched, I am so; hereafter be more kind, And think that Mary shares the grief of him she leaves behind.” There was a pause—a blissful pause; but the poet drops his pen; There are no words that can describe the lover's rapture then; And the painter would be fortunate who faithfully could trace The beautiful expression of his fair though manly face, As his arms supported her who had been lov'd so many years, Who with her head upon his heart, was smiling thro' her tears. Who is there that cannot remember moments when he cast From his bosom every feeling for the future and the past, And in the present wholly lost, beholding all most dear, Forgot to hope—forgetting there was such a thing as fear. But Mary's sweet lips broke the spell: “Oh, hasten,” she exclaim'd, “To my parents—to my parents, love, this meeting must be named.” “It has been named,” said Edward, and his cheek grew pale and cold, “It has been named; to both of them my passion has been told, By both that passion has been spurn'd, and this brief meeting o'er, My Mary will be torn from me: we part to meet no more!” But we must leave the lovers now—too long we have intruded, And prying eyes from parting scenes should always be excluded. CANTO III. Were I a country villa to select Like Granby Grove in every respect, Park like, and pretty; one of those estates With two approaches, and with two lodge gates; I never would be tempted, for the sake Of glen and mountain, cataract and lake, To choose a dwelling in its summer dress, Six hundred miles from London, (more or less) Without one human habitation near, And roads impassable one half the year. The summer choice of such a tenement Leads to “the winter of our discontent.” And oh! as little would I like to own One situated near a country town; So near that Mistress this, or Mistress that, Could drop in of an afternoon to chat; So very near, that e'en old maids could take The walk to gossip over wine and cake; And yet so far, 'twere cruel, when they come To send them back again with “not at home.” Place me the town precisely five miles off, For all my wants and wishes near enough; The mail will leave my letters at the gate; And though perhaps pedestrians must wait, And yearly club together, and approach In a landau—(the Angel's old glass coach), Between these visits months must intervene, Not angel ones—tho' few and far between. And o'er the luncheon tray we then shall hear Provincial politics just once a year; The sly remark, that certain people deem That certain people are not what they seem, Adding, that certain other people know They are, or were, or will be so and so. The confidential whispers of the day, Still whisper'd in a confidential way, Till confidants the whispers wide diffuse, And all the smiling circle shares the news. But Granby Grove is only two short miles From Granby Town; and those who don't mind stiles May walk across the fields, a shorter way; Call late, and then judiciously delay, And stay and dine—if they are ask'd to stay. The Grove is therefore often throng'd with visitors, The favour'd haunt of feminine inquisitors. Think not from this the vile opinion mine, That the word gossip must be feminine; For I have seen the male, and frankly state The coat and waistcoat gossip most I hate. For “trifles light as air” may well engage The single lady of a certain age, Who lives alone, with eyes too dim to find, With book or needle, pastime for the mind. To her it would be cruelty to grudge The observatory where she loves to lodge, In the High Street, just opposite the shop Where customers continually stop; With a bay window, where from her snug seat, She has a prospect up and down the street; Picks up the latest rumours, one by one, Hears more than ever was or will be done, And nightly takes her tea chest from the shelf, And tells to others what she heard herself. But look without abhorrence, if you can, Upon a gossip in the shape of man; Man, in whose avocations you expect Some trace of energy or intellect: The book, the pen; or else, with those who shun These home pursuits, the courser and the gun. We turn to Lady Rose, who blithe and gay Holds her last levee at the Grove to-day. We find her seated by a portly dame In silk and swan's down; Plimpton is her name, Wife of a banker, proud to represent One half of Granby town in Parliament. “What, off to-morrow!” she exclaims, “my Lady, And here you sits! you never will be ready; I keeps you from your packing, I'm afraid. But law! you leaves all them things to your maid! I does all that myself—safe bind, safe find— I sorts the articles of every kind, The heavy things at bottom—light at top; I puts my hand upon 'em when we stop, Like a phenolemon, in fact you see, I always does it all for Mister P. We goes to town next week, the House of Commons Has sent my poor dear man some sort of summons. If he sits up all night to hear them speak It will anniliate him in a week, But I suppose, if he don't go there now, The king will miss him, and there'll be a row. Great men, my Lady, leads most shocking lives, And so I'm very sure do great men's wives! I sha'nt know know no one up in town, I fear, But as we lives contagious like, down here, I hopes to meet you in a friendly way, I'll let you know our house, good day, good day!” Off waddles the great man's great wife; and now Comes a young Clergyman with simp'ring bow, (Not Mary's cousin and acknowledged Love, The Curate of the village near the Grove) The Curate of the Town, and prouder far, A Preacher aiming to be popular. And pulpit popularity is not His only aim, far from it, he has got A longing after notoriety, Whatever the pursuit may chance to be. None dress so well as the Reverend Mr. Flinn, And then how black his hair! how white his skin! The last new cut in coats, if you would own, The Reverend Mr. Flinn's is new from town. To see him rising is a perfect treat, The Reverend Mr. Flinn has such a seat! No Granby ball without his aid can answer; The Reverend Mr. Flinn is such a dancer! First at the list of concerts he is reckon'd, The Reverend Mr. Flinn sings such a second! Dames who at whist love partners who can win, Look kindly on the Reverend Mr. Flinn. At water parties he is always present, The Reverend Mr. Flinn can be so pleasant. At archeries, the arrow is put in The bull's eye by the Reverend Mr. Flinn! Some mothers, and daughters too, assert The Reverend Mr. Flinn is apt to flirt; Yet marriage surely were a greater sin In one so poor as the Reverend Mr. Flinn! A “Ladyship” is always sure to win Attention from the Reverend Mr. Flinn. And though more flattering compliments are heard When speaking to the lady of a “Lord,” The bow and smile he never can forget Due to the lady of a “Baronet.” And doubly interesting she appears, When in the rural coterie he hears That she will have that eligible thing, A house in town, in the ensuing spring. At Mrs. Plimpton's exit, John came in, And next announced “The Reverend Mr. Flinn.” “You'll be in Baker Street to-morrow night! A charming change! Your Ladyship is right: There's nothing after all like town, my Lady, I'm dying for the opera already! I must leave poor dear Granby in the lurch, And get some worthy man to serve my church. Town is my element, I never can be Appreciated in a place like Granby. I am not vain; far from it, but I seek Some chapel near the squares, when once a week I may, unbored by burials and marriages, Preach to a well dress'd crowd who come in carriages. One's lost at Granby—positively lost; I'm sick of the eternal tea and toast. 'Two'nt do to say: ‘regret you cannot go;’ They know you cannot be engag'd, they know Where every body breakfasts, dines and sups, And when at tea they fill their china cups, Look out for every creature they invite, Deem a refusal vastly impolite. The town boasts but one party in one night!” Now Lady Rose was very well aware The Reverend Mr. Flinn's incessant care Was by these very persons to be petted, And when unasked, she knew how much he fretted! Their daily flatterer, though it was his rule, Absent to turn them into ridicule! “Dear me! you quite surprise me!” she exclaim'd. “The Reverend Mr. Flinn is always nam'd At Granby with delight; I own I thought You were as glad to seek, as to be sought!” “Oh, no, my Lady, I am sadly teazed; And if at times I manage to seem pleased, It is an amiable weakness, thus To smile on those who inconvenience us.” “A moral maxim that,” said Lady Rose; “You practice what you preach, Sir, I suppose. But, Mr. Flinn, I really understood You meant to settle in the neighbourhood.” “Settle,” exclaimed the Reverend Mr. Flinn, “A charming country this to settle in! But I'm not one who, in a country town, Could, as the vulgar phrase is, ‘settle down.’ Of course your Ladyship alludes, I know, To the rumour of my marriage with Miss Snow.— She's prettyish, and rich—but you must own She is deficient both in taste and ton. I must be less attentive—'tis a sin To let her think she will be Mistress Flinn.” “How fortunate! you may commence to-day Your system of reserve without delay; See all the Snows, the parents and your love, A perfect snow storm, driving to the Grove!” The Reverend Mr. Flinn seem'd rather flurried, Rose to depart—and then his words were hurried. The Snows were usher'd in ere he retreated, He could not leave the room, he soon was seated Next the Miss Snow whose hopes were to be chill'd, And by a slighted passion prematurely kill'd! Unfortunate young man! to thaw that snow, How he hath labour'd nobody can know! And how that snow hath frozen by delay All his advances, nobody can say! And now she seems much more inclined to chat Than usual! He fidgets with his hat, Ashamed that Lady Rose the chat should see Yet loth to lose the opportunity. He fears to lose, yet is ashamed to win! Oh! most embarrass'd Reverend Mr. Flinn! Pity the man who, rising once a year A little way above his proper sphere, Strives—(vain endeavour!) to appear to be Indigenous to such society. Then, to appear recherché, he disclaims All knowledge of the old familiar names; The man whose hand in fellowship he takes, Whose roof has shelter'd him, whose bread he breaks; The woman he has woo'd with all the strength Dissimulation boasts, who loves at length, Who mourns his absence, and will smiling stand To welcome his return with lip and hand; These he disowns, or if he deems it right To say he knows them before ears polite, Insults them by acknowledgment so slight. Such is the Reverend Mr. Flinn, and now Having forsworn his friends, he knows not how To act reserve before my Lady Rose, Yet slily smile as usual on the Snows. Disastrous destiny of trifling fools, Who wish to sit, yet tamper with two stools! The Snows prepare to go, and they begin To wonder at the Reverend Mr. Flinn! “I fear you're poorly, Sir, you've walk'd too far, We'll take you back to Granby, if you are; So says Mamma—says Miss: “You know there'll be A vacant seat upon the box with me.” “Sick!” says old Snow, “Come with us, stay and dine, And I will cure you, Flinn, with old port wine!” The gentlemanly man whom you prefer, Will know you for a year, and call you “Sir;” The vulgar being whom you never seek, Will slap your back and “Flinn” you in a week! The Reverend Mr. Flinn though quite unused To saying “No, I thank you,” twice refused! Then looking with the corner of his eye At Lady Rose's face, he heav'd a sigh; And glancing at the delicate Miss Snow, He could not have the heart to utter “No.” Soon from the window Lady Rose espied The lovers on the dicky, side by side! The carriage drove away, and ere the bell Rings for the meal that most men love so well, Two dozen more across the lawn have flitted, And (most unusual thing) have been admitted! But now the last is gone, the levee done, The lady sits complacently alone, And murmurs to herself in accents sweet, “To-morrow I shall dine in Baker Street!” CANTO IV. The excellent Housekeeper, Mistress Magee, Is wild as weak women can possibly be: She fumes and she frets, and examines, and mends, And she orders about her, and superintends; Arranging and managing, early and late, Now sorting the linen, now packing the plate, Now scolding the butler for doing it wrong; Upbraiding the footman for lingering long, And speaking her mind (though a little afraid Of a saucy reply) to my lady's own maid. And all confidentially seem to agree That the journey has bothered poor Mrs. Magee. “They're going to Lunnon,” she says to herself, As she takes a large pickle jar down from a shelf, “To Lunnon!—I never knows any good come Of people's desarting their comforts at home. To Lunnon! I takes it exceeding unkind They should leave me alone in the country behind: Unless into matters my lady looks deeper, When she sees the housekeeping—she'll miss the housekeeper! You go with them, Jane—deary me! I forget That all the folks call you now Mistress Rosette; Humph—Mistress Rosette! how you used to complain, As a housemaid, at my never calling you ‘Jane;’ But how could I help it? now don't take it ill, I can't forget Jenny, the drudge at the mill.” Cries Mistress Rosette: “I despises your words; We all knows your temper would turn cream to curds. I'd answer—but anger destroys the complexion: Your age and your 'firmities is your protection! You envies my going to Lunnon, I see. These trips are agreeable Mistress Magee.” “Don't talk about trips,” says the keeper of keys, “Don't talk about trips, Ma'am, to me if you please; For your trips I suspect that you need not go far: You've had plenty of trips in your time, Mistress R.” Says Mistress Rosette, and she doubles her fist; “I advises you, Mistress Magee, to desist; To answer such obsequies only degrades To a level with you, Madam—us lady's maids.” “Lady's maids!” with a sneer says the elderly dame; “The gentlemen's maids were a much better name.” And dreading a most pugilistic response, The housekeeper quitted the chamber at once. Oh sad is the housekeeper, ordered to air The old family seat with no family there! To open the windows, to let in the light Upon furniture only, and shut them at night; To hear the wind whistling thro' the spring leaves, No man in the mansion, and dreaming of thieves! No talk with my lady, no orders to take, No dinners to manage, no pastry to make, No housemaid to scold for not using a broom, No gossip and tea in the housekeeper's room; No quality company coming to stay, No little donation on going away, No pleasant civilities: “Happy to see You are looking so charmingly, Mistress Magee! I hope I shall find you as blooming next year, Without you, I scarcely should know myself here.” Oh! nothing of this! she must fold up once more The things that were very well folded before, Or trying to think herself busy, bestow New papers and brandy to jams on the go. The morn of departure, poor Mrs. Magee Is ready at six, with toast, coffee and tea; The carriage is pack'd, and Sir Hampton, his lady, And Mary, are seated within it already; And Mistress Rosette, scorning weather and wind, Is seated with John in the rumble behind: The wheels are in motion—and standing alone, Poor Mistress Magee's occupation is gone. And fast flies the travelling carriage, so fast That the Granby Grove boundaries quickly are past. And now to the Rectory lawn they are close— Poor Mary leans forward to gaze at the house; Her eyes on one casement are fix'd, but so dim Is the grey light of morning, she cannot see him. But onward they go, and a turn in the road Soon veils from her view the poor curate's abode; With that—from her bosom all hope disappears— She leans back in the carriage, and bursts into tears. But one at the Rectory casement hath been, Looking forth as they pass'd, tho' by Mary unseen. His night has been sleepless, ah! who hath not known, What it is in the darkness to stand all alone By the window, and eagerly watch for the least Ray of morning that colours the clouds in the east! Yes, who has not gazed, when the daylight appear'd For an early departure, expected, yet fear'd; Now wondering what can have caused a delay Now certain that something induced them to stay. Looking out at each noise, with so eager an eye, As if 'twould be pleasure to see them pass by! Oh! who has not known what the weary one feels, Who at length in reality hears the swift wheels, And traces, or rather believes he can trace, In the gloom of the carriage, one upturning face, As if seeking for him, where he oft has been sought; And then ere quite sure of the glimpse he has caught, The wheels indistinctly are heard!—they are past. Can it be she is gone—could that look be the last! He ought to have spoken; why did he not stand To acknowledge that look with a wave of the hand? She will think he was sleeping—how cold and remiss, To be able to sleep on a morning like this! What would he not give, to behold her go by Once again—though the vision as swiftly would fly! In the instant, she might have beheld on his cheek The sorrow which plainer than language can speak. She might have remember'd that agonised glance In the radiant assembly, the banquet, the dance; She might have remember'd that look, when the voice Of a lover more noble proclaims her his choice, And her lips might have murmur'd: “No, constant I'll be, I will ne'er forget him, he will ne'er forget me.” SEASONABLE DITTIES. DON'T TALK OF SEPTEMBER! I Don't talk of September!—a lady Must think it of all months the worst; The men are preparing already To take themselves off on the first. I try to arrange a small party, The girls dance together; how tame! I'd get up my game of écarté, But they go to bring down their game! II Last month, their attention to quicken, A supper I knew was the thing; But now from my turkey and chicken They're tempted by birds on the wing! They shoulder their terrible rifles, (It's really too much for my nerves!) And slighting my sweets and my trifles, Prefer my Lord Harry's preserves! III Miss Lovemore, with great consternation, Now hears of the horrible plan, And fears that her little flirtation Was only a flash in the pan! Oh! marriage is hard of digestion, The men are all sparing of words; And now 'stead of popping the question, They set off to pop at the birds. IV Go, false ones, your aim is so horrid, That love at the sight of you dies; You care not for locks on the forehead, The locks made by Manton you prize! All thoughts sentimental exploding, Like flints I behold you depart; You heed not, when priming and loading, The load you have left on my heart. V They talk about patent percussions, And all preparations for sport; And these double barrel discussions Exhaust double bottles of port! The dearest is deaf to my summons, As off on his pony he jogs; A doleful condition is woman's; The men are all gone to the dogs! THE MONTH OF OCTOBER IS BAD! I The month of October is bad As the month of September can be; “Oh, there's not in the wide world” a beau to be had, Some are shooting, and some are at sea! A lonely life woman endures, Deserted for pointers or yachts; With some at their moorings, and some at the moors, Mad for cruises or gunpowder plots! II Sir Charles leaves his mate hymeneal, To sail with the mate of his yawl! Of an amateur sailor the true beau ideal, Blue shirt, jacket, backy, and all! Of quicksands hid under the tide He dreams, as he lies in his berth; Once he thought of no quicksands, save those wont to glide Through Time's glass in a season of mirth! III His cab for a cabin neglected, (The gig that he has is a boat!) The nobleman seaman would blush if detected In wearing a gentleman's coat! His books, lest his lingo should fail, are The maritime novels alone; Chamier's clever “Life of a Sailor,” Or Marryat's matchless “King's Own.” IV For no prima donna he cares; He gives up his box and his stall; And all recollection of Malibran's airs Is very soon lost in a squall! “Oh, her form is divine!” he may cry, But the form that he means is a ship's! And e'en Taglioni unnoticed trips by, Superseded by nautical trips! V When snug in Cowes harbour he's brave, And he sings as he paces the deck, And feeling a mere Lilliputian wave, He recklessly laughs at a wreck. But at Cherbourg, when tempests assail, He wishes he never had sail'd; And if he should happen to weather the gale, He'll take care he is never re-galed. THE LAST SUMMER BONNET. A NOVEMBER PASTORAL. I 'Tis the last summer bonnet, The worse for the wear; The feathers upon it Are dimm'd by sea air: Gay places it went to, But lingers at last, A faded memento Of sunny days past. II The prejudice still is For poets to moan, When roses and lilies Are going and gone. But Fashion her sonnet Would rather compose On summer's last bonnet, Than summer's last rose! III Though dreary November Has darken'd the sky, You still must remember That day in July, When after much roaming, To Carson's we went, For something becoming To take into Kent. IV You, long undecided What bonnet to choose, At length chose, as I did, The sweetest of blues. Yours now serves to show, dear, How fairest things fade; And I long ago, dear, Gave mine to my maid. V Oh, pause for a minute, Ere yours is resign'd; Philosophy in it A moral may find. To past scenes I'm hurried, That relic revives The beaux we worried Half out of their lives. VI 'Twas worn at all places Of public resort; At Hogsnorton races, So famous for sport. That day, when the Captain Would after us jog, And thought us entrapt in His basket of prog! VII He gave me a sandwich, And not being check'd, He offered a hand—which I chose to reject! And then you were teased with The gentleman's heart, Because you seem'd pleased with His gooseberry tart! VIII 'Twas worn at the ladies' Toxopholite fête, (That sharp-shooting trade is A thing that I hate; Their market they mar, who Attempt, for a prize, To shoot with an arrow, Instead of their eyes.) IX And don't that excursion By water forget; Sure, summer diversion Was never so wet! To sit there and shiver, And hear the wind blow, The rain, and the river, Above, and below! X But hang the last bonnet, What is it to us, That we should muse on it, And moralise thus? A truce to reflecting; To Carson's we'll go, Intent on selecting A winter chapeau. XI Then let Betty take it, For Betty likes blue; And Betty can make it Look better than new. In taste Betty's fellow Was never yet seen; She'll line it with yellow, And trim it with green! ALL HAIL TO THEE, HOARY DECEMBER! A DECEMBER PASTORAL. I All hail to thee, hoary December! All hail! (except mizzle and sleet)— Dark month, if one half I remember, A list of thy charms I'll repeat: Though roses are faded, and mute is The nightingale's song in the grove, Thou art, among candlelight beauties, The one of all others I love. II Now mulligatawny is chosen For luncheons, both wholesome and nice; And, Grange, thy brisk trade is quite frozen, For nobody purchases ice! There's ice on the Serpentine river, Where ladies and gentlemen skate, And whilst on the margin I shiver, They flourish a figure of eight! III Oh come with thy thousand ingredients For making an exquisite feast; Oh come with thy countless expedients For fattening up a prize beast! Thy cooks, whose perpetual work is To mince meat, shall hail thy approach; And oh, what uncommon fine turkeys From Norwich fly up by the coach! IV Oh! all love December with reason;— For while Hospitality feeds Her guests, she well knows 'tis the season For charity's holier deeds. And thus rich and poor have to thank it, For gifts which impartially flow; The pauper, when wrapp'd in his blanket, Sighs not for a blanquette de veau. V Oh, come with thy Christmas vagaries, Thy harlequin pantomime jumps, Grim ogres, and beautiful fairies, In gossamer trousers and pumps! Oh come with thy clownish grimaces, Thy pantaloon practical wit; And, tier above tier, merry faces In gallery, boxes, and pit! VI Oh come with George Barnwell and Millwood, A drama of practical force, Which, were we disposed to do ill, would Soon make us good people of course. Young Barnwell—the author alleges— Got rid of his money too fast; And, bothered with pawnbroker's pledges, He murdered his uncle at last! VII Come hither with fun and with folly, Bring icicle gems on thy brow, The bright coral beads of the holly, And pearls from the mistletoe bough. Oh come with thy shining apparel, Thy robe like the snow on the hill; And come above all, with a barrel Of something to take off the chill! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. FRIAR LAURENCE AND JULIET.FRIAR. Who is calling Friar Laurence? Madam Juliet! how d'ye do? Dear me—talk of the—beg pardon— I've been talking about you. Mistress Montague, they tell me You on Thursday mean to wed! It is strange you never told me That poor Mister M. was dead!JULIET. M.'s alive! yet County Paris I'm to marry, people say! (I shall marry the whole county If I go on in this way:) Once you've wedded me already, If I wed again, you see, Though in you a little error, 'Twill be very big o' me.FRIAR. 'Pon my life, it's very awkward! I'll on some expedient hit. If you'll find me ready money, I will find you ready wit: I can't let you wed a second, Ere I know the first has died; Think of faggots! for such deeds, ma'am, Holy friars have been fried!JULIET. 'Tan't my wish, sir, nor intention,— Any scheme of yours I'll hail; To escape from County Paris, Put me in the county jail. Kill me dead! and make me food for Earthworm, viper, toad or rat; Make a widower of Ro-me- -O,—('twill hurt me to do that!)FRIAR. If you've really resolution That your life-blood should be spilt, I will save you, for I'll have you Not quite killed, but merely kilt. Could you in a vault be buried— Horizontal—in a niche? And of death so good a copy, None could find out which is which?JULIET. I would vault into a vault, sir, With a dead man in his shroud; I'd do any dirty work, sir, Though my family's so proud! I'll do whatsoe'er you bid me, 'Till you say I've done enough: Nay, sir, much as I dislike it, I'll take 'poticary's stuff!FRIAR. Then go home, ma'am, and be merry; Say that Paris you will wed; Tell your nurse you've got a headache, And go quietly to bed. Ask for something warm,—some negus, Grog, or gruel, or egg-flip, Put in this, and then drink quickly,— 'Tis so nauseous if you sip.JULIET. Give, oh! give me quick that phial, From the trial I'll not shrink; Is it shaken when it's taken? Gracious me! it's black as ink! There's no fear, I trust, of failure? No, I doubt not its effect; From your conversation's tenor No base phial I expect.FRIAR. You will have the bridegroom follow Where he generally leads; 'Stead of hymeneal flowers, He will wear sepulchral weeds: I to Romeo will quickly Write a letter by the post; He will wake you, and should Paris Meet you,—say you are your ghost!JULIET. 'Tis an excellent arrangement, As you bid me I will act; But within the tomb, dear friar, Place a basket nicely pack'd;— Just a loaf, a tongue, a chicken, Port and sherry, and some plums; 'Twill really be a comfort, Should I wake e'er Romeo comes! THE ABBESS AND THE DUCHESS.ABBESS. Who is knocking for admission, At the convent's outer gate? Is it possible a lady Can be wandering so late? Let me see her through the lattice, And her story let me hear. Oh! your most obedient madam; May I ask what brings you here?DUCHESS. You will very much applaud me, When you hear what I have done; I've been naughty,—I'm a penitent, and want to be a nun. I've been treated most unfairly, Though 'tis said I am most fair; I am rich, ma'am, and a duchess, And my name's La Vallière.ABBESS. Get along, you naughty woman, You'll contaminate us all; When you touch'd the gate, I wonder That the convent did not fall! Stop! I think you mention'd money, That is—penitence, I mean. Let her in—I'm too indulgent; Pray how are the King and Queen?DUCHESS. Lady Abbess, you delight me; Oh! had Louis been as kind! But he used me ungenteelly, To my fondness deaf and blind. Oh! methinks that now I view him, With his feathers in his hat! Hem!—beg pardon—I'm aware, ma'am, That I mustn't speak of that.ABBESS. Not by no means, madam, never; No—you mustn't even think; Put your feet upon the fender And here's something warm to drink. Is it strong enough?—pray stir it. What on earth could make you go From a palace to a convent? Come, I'm curious to know.DUCHESS. Can you wonder, Lady Abbess, At the change I should rejoice; I of vanities was weary, And a convent was my choice. I have had a troubled conscience, And court manners did condemn, Ever since I saw King Louis Making eyes at Madame M.ABBESS. Oh! I think I comprehend you; But take care what you're about; Though 'tis easy to get in here, 'Tan't so easy to get out. You'll for beads resign your jewels, And your robes for garments plain; Ere you cut the world, remember— 'Tis not cut and come again.DUCHESS. I am willing in a cloister That my days and nights should pass; This is very nice indeed, ma'am, If you please, another glass) As for courtiers, I'll hereafter Lay the odious topic by; Oh! their crooked ways enough are For to turn a nun awry.ABBESS. Very proper. To the sisters 'Twould be wrong to chatter thus; Now and then, when snug and cosey, 'Twill do very well for us. It is strange how tittle-tattle All about the convent spreads, When the barber from the village Comes to shave the sisters' heads.DUCHESS. Do you really mean to tell me I must lose my raven locks? Then I'll tie 'em up with ribbon, And I'll keep 'em in my box. Oh! how Louis used to praise 'em! Hem! I think I'll go to bed. Not another drop, I thank you, It would get into my head.ABBESS. Benedicte! my daughter, You'll be soon used to the place; Though at meals our only duchess, You will have to say your grace. And when none can interrupt us, You of courtly scenes shall tell, When I bring a drop of comfort From my cellar to my cell! THE FEMALE CONVICT-SHIP. I The tide is in, the breeze is fair, The vessel under weigh; The gallant prow glides swiftly on, And throws aside the spray. The tranquil ocean, mirror-like, Reflects the deep blue skies; And, pointing to the destin'd course, The straighten'd pennon flies. II Oh! none of those heart-cradled prayers That never reach the lip, No benedictions wait upon That fast-receding ship. No tearful eyes are strain'd to watch Its progress from the land; And there are none to wave the scarf, And none to kiss the hand. III Yet women throng that vessel's deck, The haggard and the fair, The young in guilt, and the depraved Are intermingled there! The girl, who from her mother's arms Was early lured away; The harden'd hag, whose trade hath been To lead the pure astray. IV A young and sickly mother kneels Apart from all the rest; And with a song of home she lulls The babe upon her breast. She falters—for her tears must flow, She cannot end the verse; And nought is heard among the crowd But laughter, shout, or curse! V 'Tis sunset. Hark! the signal gun;— All from the deck are sent, The young, the old, the best, the worst, In one dark dungeon pent! Their wailings, and their horrid mirth Alike are hush'd in sleep; And now the female convict-ship In silence ploughs the deep. VI But long the lurid tempest-cloud Hath brooded o'er the waves; And suddenly the winds are roused, And leave their secret caves. And up aloft the ship is borne, And down again as fast, And every mighty billow seems More dreadful than the last. VII Oh! who that loves the pleasure-barque By summer breezes fann'd, Shall dare to paint the ocean-storm, Terrifically grand? When helplessly the vessel drifts, Each torn sail closely furl'd, When not a man of all the crew Knows whither she is hurl'd! IX And who shall tell the agony Of those confined beneath, Who in the darkness dread to die— How unprepared for death! Who, loathing, to each other cling, When every hope hath ceased, And beat against their prison door, And shriek to be released! X Three times the ship hath struck. Again! She never more will float. Oh! wait not for the rising tide; Be steady—man the boat! And see, assembled on the shore The merciful, the brave: Quick, set the female convicts free, There still is time to save! XI It is in vain! what demon blinds The captain and the crew? The rapid rising of the tide With mad delight they view. They hope the coming waves will waft The convict ship away! The foaming monster hurries on, Impatient for his prey! XII And he is come! the rushing flood In thunder sweeps the deck; The groaning timbers fly apart, The vessel is a wreck! One moment, from the female crowd There comes a fearful cry; The next, they're hurl'd into the deep, To struggle, and to die! XIII Their corses strew a foreign shore, Left by the ebbing tide; And sixty in a ghastly row Lie number'd, side by side! The lifeless mother's bleeding form Comes floating from the wreck; And lifeless is the babe she bound So fondly round her neck! XIV 'Tis morn; the anxious eye can trace No vessel on the deep; But gather'd timber on the shore Lies in a gloomy heap. In winter time those brands will blaze, Our tranquil homes to warm, Though torn from that poor convict ship That perish'd in the storm! TWENTY YEARS! I They tell me twenty years are past, Since I have look'd upon thee last, And thought thee fairest of the fair, With thy sylph-like form and light-brown hair! I can remember every word That from those smiling lips I heard. Oh! how little it appears Like the lapse of twenty years! II Thou art changed! in thee I find Beauty of another kind; Those rich curls lie on thy brow In a darker cluster now; And the sylph hath given place To the matron's form of grace. Yet, how little it appears Like the lapse of twenty years! III Still thy cheek is round and fair; 'Mid thy curls not one grey hair; Not one lurking sorrow lies In the lustre of those eyes. Thou hast felt, since last we met, No affliction, no regret! Wonderful! to shed no tears In the lapse of twenty years! IV But what means that changing brow? Tears are in those dark eyes now! Have my rash, incautious, words Waken'd feeling's slumbering chords? Wherefore dost thou bid me look At yon dark-bound journal-book? There the register appears Of the lapse of twenty years! V Thou hast been a happy bride, Kneeling by a lover's side; And unclouded was thy life, As his loved and loving wife. Thou hast worn the garb of gloom, Kneeling by that husband's tomb; Thou hast wept a widow's tears In the lapse of twenty years! VI Oh! I see my error now, To suppose, in cheek and brow, Strangers may presume to find Treasured secrets of the mind. There fond Memory still will keep Her vigil, when she seems to sleep; Though composure re-appears In the lapse of twenty years! VII Where's the hope that can abate The grief of hearts thus desolate? That can youth's keenest pangs assuage, And mitigate the gloom of age? Religion bids the tempest cease, And leads her to a port of peace; And on, the lonely pilot steers Through the lapse of future years! A PARTY OF PLEASURE. BEING A PAINFUL RETROSPECT OF A TRIP. I A party of pleasure! a party of four, Too few if one less, too many if more; A man and his wife, a beau and a belle Set out on a journey from—whence I shan't tell. II One sketch'd upon paper a plan of the tour, A peep at all places of note to ensure: Oh! think how divine, when the weather is fine, To go via Brussels as far as the Rhine! III The Rhine is a river all tourists should see; That any can miss it astonishes me! No place of repute on the road we'll let slip, But we look to the Rhine as the pride of our trip. IV The bachelor beau, when we landed in France, Was judiciously placed at the head of finance; And ere we set out, as a matter of course, He put in his pocket a very big purse. V I hate English money; I own that I doat On the high-sounding name of a hundred-franc note; Four pounds may sound paltry, but tell it in francs, And we fear not a check to our travelling pranks. VI But when four times four English pounds we can count, (Which, changed into francs, to four hundred amount,) To Constantinople away we may dash, Without the least fear of exhausting our cash. VII We changed it to dollars before we set out; We like solid coin, and a purse that is stout; So the bachelor beau bought a sort of a sack, And he totter'd away with his load on his back. VIII We travell'd by day, and we rested by night; Our purse it was heavy, our hearts they were light; We feasted like princes, but, sipping our wine, Said we, “We'll drink Hock, when we get to the Rhine.” IX At Brussels, delighted, we rose with the lark, The play-bill we read ere we walk'd in the park: “'Tis Robert le Diable! how very divine! And to-morrow, of course, we set out for the Rhine!” X Gods! what has befallen the man of finance? How pallid his cheek! how distracted his glance! Can the bachelor beau wear that visage of gloom? Sure 'tis Robert le Diable just fresh from the tomb! XI “We're lost! we're undone!” cried the man of finance, “Sure never had mortal so sad a mischance! What demon possess'd us? Ah! why did we come? We havn't got money to carry us home!” XII “No money!” exclaimed Mr. Dee, in despair; “No money!” cried Mrs. Dee, tearing her hair; “No money!” said frantic Elizabeth Roe; “No money!” responded the bachelor beau. XIII “I've only got money to take us half-way.” “What! none for a dinner? what! none for the play?” “What! none!” said Elizabeth Roe, turning pale, “I wanted to purchase the sweetest lace veil!” XIV No dinner! no coffee! no supper! no lace! And though we were each of us book'd for a place, 'Twas no place at the play;—no, we started at nine, By a coach that did not go the road to the Rhine. XV Oh! had you but seen us at Lisle the next day! How could we have breakfast with nothing to pay? And the man of finance just awoke from a nap, With the purse on his head for a travelling cap! XVI Cried poor Mr. Dee, “Let our watches be sold; “And here,” said his wife, “is my chain of pure gold;” “And here are my ear-rings,” Elizabeth mutter'd; “Oh! get me some coffee, and toast that is buttered.” XVII But oh! in that moment of panic and grief An elderly gentleman gave us relief; When he heard of our wants, he unbutton'd his coat, And obligingly lent us a hundred-franc note. MORAL. Ye tourists, attend, and my moral discern; Wherever you go, bear in mind your return; And, in some little pocket, be sure that you pack Just money sufficient to carry you back! MY PENSION. I What, take away my Pension! a word with you, Lord Grey; You cannot be so barbarous! you mean not what you say; I have enjoyed, for seven years, twelve hundred pounds a-year, 'Twas granted me by George the Fourth, how can you interfere? I really hoped you'd think it right to grant me an extension; It never once occurr'd to me you'd take away my Pension! II The thing's so inconvenient, you'll force me to retrench— Indeed, retrenchment will not do, you'll send me to the bench! How can you serve a lady so! oh! if I were a man, I'd call you out, my noble lord, and end you with your plan. You might retrench in many little ways that I could mention, But what on earth possesses you to take away my Pension! III You ask about my services; but surely to intrude, And ask a lady such a thing, is little less than rude. Of course I could explain to you—My Lord, I say again, If 'twas my pleasure so to do, of course I could explain; I'm sure I've many female friends of vastly less pretension, Who've met with greater recompense—then don't disturb my Pension! IV Reform may all be very proper, in a certain line, I never can object to it, it's no affair of mine. Reform the House of Commons, and correct abuses there, But don't reform my little house in Green-street Grosvenor-square. Don't seize my jewels, to allay the popular dissension— You can't appease the radicals with my poor little Pension. V The revolutionists abroad have stirr'd up all this fuss: But can your lordship tell me, what are Paris mobs to us? Because the papers bore one so about the row at Brussels; Must English ladies interfere with foreign people's bustles? Now be assured, my noble lord, 'twas folly set the French on; You really are not call'd upon to take away my Pension. VI Propriety might prompt your economical design, In many cases doubtless,—but believe me not in mine; Were I alone, I now might make a sacrifice, 'tis true, But all my family, you know, have little pensions too; My brothers and my cousins would go mad, were I to mention The revolutionary scheme of giving up a pension! VII I think it would be setting an extremely bad example In times like these, when people are endeavouring to trample On all our ancient usages, and raising such a storm About the place and pension list, and radical reform. I say, my Lord, that I should feel deserving reprehension, If I—by these intimidated—threw away my pension. VIII I'm quite convinced the only way of setting matters right, And making common people see things in a proper light, Is keeping up the ancient aristocracy of course, And keeping down plebeians with a military force; The lower orders really are so dull of comprehension, They can't see the utility of granting me a pension. IX The truth is this—(you must not deem these few remarks intrusive)— The aristocracy are not sufficiently exclusive. They call on mistress this and that, and curtsey at a ball To people who, in point of fact, are nobodies at all! I never could perceive the use of smiling condescension— It makes the upstarts insolent, they cavil at a pension. X When I am at my country seat, I shun this growing evil, No member of the middling ranks presumes to call me civil. I never call on them, and if one dares pay me a visit, She comes in some old-fashion'd gown, and I and Laura quiz it; And at the race-ball once a year, I set the upper bench on, In high unbending dignity,—so I deserve my pension. XI Now pray, my lord, consider this, you're ruined if you grant Concessions of this sweeping kind the common people want. The aristocracy must not be interfered with thus: Pray tell me what are starving individuals to us? To pacify the radicals, and end all this contention, We'll call my little income by some other name than pension. XII Of course, my lord, you can retrench in ev'ry other way, The clerks in public offices may scribble on half-pay; The captains and the cornets, and the curates may be fleeced, (The incomes of the bishops, by the by, should be increased). I see you are convinced, my lord, and through your intervention, I trust, in spite of Mr. Hume, you'll let me keep my pension! A PROLOGUE TO AN AMATEUR PLAY, PERFORMED AT BATH, IN AID OF A CHARITY. Another prologue?—zounds! let others speak, I spoke a prologue, Sirs, last Friday week. Besides, I'm Romeo, feathers, frills and all, Equipt for Lady Sykes's fancy ball! Well, if it must be so, I'll e'en commence, And speak of motives and benevolence, Of first attempts, and fears, and arduous parts, And debutants with palpitating hearts; And I'll just hint, before the play begins, Charity hides a multitude of sins. Blame not the novice for his want of skill, Ye critics, say not he is acting ill; May those relieved by this night's profit tell That we, at least for once, have acted well. Then wherefore should I labour to excite A charitable feeling here to-night? It is in charity we face you thus: Then pray look down with charity on us. Who would not take a part in such a cause, Then take our parts and give us your applause. Your plaudits give me confidence, and yet 'Tis strange, I almost hear them with regret. This season—which in radiant pride appears, After the twinkling lights of former years— This brilliant season, so supremely graced With rank, wealth, worth, with beauty, talent, taste, Is drawing to a close, and those I fear Who linger still to aid our efforts here, Will soon be packing trunks and ordering chaises, And seeking rival scenes, and gathering daisies. Yet ere you seek sea breezes, deign to cast One hearty glance on mirthful moments past. Confess that pleasure reigns despotic here, And promise to come back again next year. Farewell—but let me offer, ere we part, Earnest good wishes, spoken from the heart. Some during the past season have it seems, Arranged some little matrimonial schemes, And now dream every night of turtle doves, Of wedding favours, cake and white kid gloves. Oh, may they all be happy, and possess Bliss far beyond their single blessedness. Reside in Bath from January to June, And find in every month a honeymoon. May the town prosper, may the wealthy aid With liberal hand her charities and trade; And whilst her leading stars combine to plot New sports to animate this favoured spot— Oh! may the counter-plot be just as pleasant, And the Town Hall be merry as the Crescent. May fashion still strew roses in our path, And each year add prosperity to Bath. IS THERE AN UNBELIEVER? I Is there an unbeliever! One man who walks the earth, And madly doubts that providence Watch'd o'er him at his birth? He robs mankind for ever Of hope beyond the tomb; What gives he as a recompense?— The brute's unhallow'd doom! II In manhood's loftiest hour, In health, and strength, and pride, Oh! lead his steps through alleys green, Where rills 'mid cowslips glide. Climb nature's granite tower, Where man hath rarely trod; And will he then, in such a scene, Deny there is a God? III Yes,—the proud heart will ever Prompt the false tongue's reply! An Omnipotent providence Still madly he'll deny. But see the unbeliever Sinking in death's decay; And hear the cry of penitence! He never learnt to pray! LINES OCCASIONED BY A VISIT TO MR. JOHN BANIM, IN HIS LAST ILLNESS. I I saw him on his couch of pain, And when I heard him speak, It was of Hope long nurs'd in vain, And tears stole down his cheek. He spoke of honours early won, Which youth could rarely boast; Of high endeavours well begun, But prematurely lost. II I saw him on a brighter day, Among the first spring flow'rs; Despairing thoughts had pass'd away, He spoke of future hours; He spoke of health, of spirits freed To take a noble aim; Of efforts that were sure to lead To fortune and to fame! III They bear him to a genial land The cradle of the weak; Oh! may it nerve the feeble hand, And animate the cheek! Oh! may he, when we meet again, Those flattering hopes recall, And smiling say,—“They were not vain, I've realised them all!” SONGS AND BALLADS. SHOW ME THE RUINED MAN. I Show me the ruined man Who never hopes to rise, Who on the earth where he is hurl'd, Without an effort lies. Oh! bid him come to me And tell his secret care; Whate'er it be, he yet must learn Man never should despair. II This is not said by one, Who no reverse has known; The chances are, his lot hath been Less gloomy than my own. But God will give us strength For the burthen we must bear; Adversity hath taught me this— Man never should despair. III The gloom of blighted hopes None better know than I, And wrong'd by those I loved, I've pray'd To lay me down and die! But blessings still remain'd, And 'twas an impious prayer; Hope will not leave a guiltless mind, Man never should despair. UPON THY TRUTH RELYING. I They say we are too young to love, Too wild to be united; In scorn, they bid us both renounce The fond vows we have plighted. They send thee forth to see the world, Thy love by absence trying; Then go! for I can smile farewell— Upon thy truth relying. II I know that pleasure's hand will throw Her silken nets about thee: I know how lonesome I shall find The long—long days without thee. But in thy letters there'll be joy: The reading—the replying; I'll kiss each word that's traced by thee— Upon thy truth relying. III When friends applaud thee, I'll sit by, In silent rapture gazing; And oh! how proud of being loved, By her they have been praising! But should detraction breathe thy name, The world's reproofs defying: I'd love thee—laud thee—trust thee still— Upon thy truth relying. IV E'en those who smile to see us part Shall see us meet with wonder: Such trials only make the heart That truly loves grow fonder. Our sorrows past shall be our pride, When with each other vying: Thou wilt confide in him who lives Upon thy truth relying. THE GIPSIES' HAUNT. I Why curls the blue smoke o'er the trees? What words are borne upon the breeze? Some cottage in yon lonely glen Lies nestled from the eyes of men. Unconsciously we've wandered near Some rural play-place, for I hear The sound in which my heart rejoices; The melody of infant voices. II Alas! in that green nook we see, No dwelling-place of industry; No dame, intent on household cares, The neat, but frugal meal prepares; No sire his labour o'er, will come To brighten and to share her home; No children from their mother learn An honest way their bread to earn. III The gipsies, wild and wandering race, Are masters of the sylvan chase; Beneath the boughs their tents they raise. Upon the turf their faggots blaze: In coarse profusion they prepare The feast, obtain'd,—how, when, and where? While swarthy forms, with clamour loud, Around the smoking cauldron crowd. IV Forth trips a laughing dark-eyed lass To interrupt us as we pass; Upon your right hand let her look, And there she will read, as in a book, Your future fortune, and reveal The joy or woe you're doom'd to feel. Your course of love she will unfold, If you the picture dare behold! THE FIRST GREY HAIR. I The matron at her mirror, with her hand upon her brow, Sits gazing on her lovely face—ay, lovely even now! Why doth she lean upon her hand, with such a look of care? Why steals that tear across her cheeks? She sees her first grey hair. II Time from her form hath taken away but little of its grace; His touch of thought hath dignified the beauty of her face: Yet she might mingle in the dance, where maidens gaily trip, So bright is still her hazel eye, so beautiful her lip. III The faded form is often marked by sorrow more than years, The wrinkle on the cheeks may be the course of secret tears. The mournful lip may murmur of a love it ne'er confest, And the dimness of the eye betray a heart that cannot rest. IV But she hath been a happy wife; the lover of her youth May proudly claim the smile that pays the trial of his truth. A sense of slight,—of loneliness,—hath never banished sleep: Her life hath been a cloudless one: then wherefore doth she weep! V She looked upon her raven locks: what thoughts did they recall? Oh! not of nights, when they were decked for banquet or for ball: They brought back thoughts of early youth, e'er she had learnt to check With artificial wreaths, the curls that sported o'er her neck. VI She seemed to feel her mother's hand pass lightly through her hair, And draw it from her brow to leave a kiss of kindness there; She seemed to view her father's smile, and feel the playful touch That sometimes feigned to steal away the curls she prized so much. VII And now she sees her first grey hair! oh! deem it not a crime, For her to weep, when she beholds the first foot-mark of time! She knows that, one by one, those mute mementos will increase, And steal youth, beauty, strength away, till life itself shall cease. VIII 'Tis not the tree of vanity for beauty on the wane, Yet though the blossom may not sigh to bud and bloom again, It cannot but remember, with a feeling of regret, The spring for ever gone—the summer sun so nearly set. IX Ah! lady! heed the monitor! thy mirror tells thee truth, Assume the matron's folded veil, resign the wreath of youth. Go! bind it on thy daughter's brow, in her thou'lt still look fair; 'Twere well would all learn wisdom, who behold the first grey hair. THE BANISHED. I Oh give me back my heavy chain; I ask not to be free; I pray'd for life, but now the boon Has lost its charms for me: The blameless life of former years, I know thou canst not give, And banish'd from the friends of youth, I cannot wish to live. II It is a doom far worse than death, To join yon guilty band,— The banish'd ones, who never more Shall view their own loved land. The felon in his grave hears not The curse that brands his name,— More happy than the criminal, Whose living lot—is shame. HE RODE BY AT MORN. I He rode by at morn on his courser so black, And he said that at noon we should see him ride back; Like a bridegroom, who speeds to his bride, he was drest, A plume in his cap, and arose at his breast. Look forth from the casement—look over the plam, We shall see him ride by on his courser again. II I hear the steed coming, his form I discern, No—'tis not the rider who pass'd me at morn! 'Tis his rival, whose right arm encircles the waist Of a lady, whose light form before him is placed! So swiftly they pass, that pursuit will be vain— Oh, when will the poor lover pass us again? III Another steed comes, but so tardy his pace, He seems like a jaded one last in a race! His rider looks down with vexation and gloom, His rosebud is faded, and broken his plume: He gaily rode by us at morn—but 'tis plain, Displeased with his journey, he rides back again. HERE'S A BUMPER TO HER. I Here's a bumper to her, the brunette, With her glances of luminous jet; She is come from the clime, Where the dancer keeps time, To the sound of the gay castanet. Fill high—here's a bumper to her! II Here's a bumper to her, who is fair As the fancy-form'd sylphs of the air; Her blue eye is mild As the glance of a child, Yet love's habitation is there. Fill high—here's a bumper to her! III Here's a bumper to her, if not blind, Charms in all you may easily find, Should your eyes chance to trace Not one charm in the face, Be content with the charms of the mind. Fill high—here's bumper to her! HE CAME AT MORN. I He came at morn to the lady's bower— He sang, and play'd till the noontide hour;— He sang of war—he sang of love, Of battle-field, and peaceful grove: The lady could have stay'd all day To hear that gentle Minstrel play! And when she saw the Minstrel go The lady's tears began to flow. II At mid-day, with her page she went To grace a splendid tournament; And there she saw an armed knight, With golden helm and plumage white; With grace he rode his sable steed, And after many a martial deed, He knelt to her with words most sweet, And laid his trophies at her feet. III At night, in robes both rich and rare, With jewels sparkling in her hair, She sought the dance; and smiling came A youthful prince, who breathed her name. He sang—it was the minstrel's strain! He knelt—she saw the knight again! With lovers three—how blest to find The charms of all in one combined I THOUGHT OF THEE. I I thought of thee, when o'er the sea My vessel flew before the wind, Though mem'ry brought no trace of aught, Save chilling frowns and words unkind! Too well, I knew my last adieu Had caused no sad regret for me; Yet when the shore was seen no more, I thought of thee—I thought of thee! II I thought of thee, when over me Unheeded blew the wintry blast, My fancy roved to scenes I loved, In happy years for ever past. While others slept, I often wept, And gazed upon the dreary sea; And all the night, till dawning light, I thought of thee—I thought of thee! I CANNOT CALL THEE FAIR. I I cannot call thee fair, my child, I cannot call thee fair, Unless a perfect form and face Be joined to gifts more rare; If to thy features blameless thoughts The boasted charm impart, I'll own that thou art beautiful, And press thee to my heart! II I cannot call thee eloquent, Nor listen with delight, Like some, who deem that ruby lips Are always in the right; But if from truth's integrity Thy accents ne'er depart, I'll own that thou art eloquent, And press thee to my heart! III I cannot call thee fortunate, E'en should I see thee count Thy worldly treasures o'er and o'er, And boast of their amount; But if the friendless, of thy store, May claim an ample part, I'll own that thou art fortunate, And press thee to my heart! I HAVE KNOWN THEE IN THE SUNSHINE. I I have known thee in the sunshine Of thy beauty and thy bloom, I have known thee in the shadow Of thy sickness and thy gloom; I have lov'd thee for thy sweet smile, When thy heart was light and gay; But, alas! I lov'd thee better, When the smile had pass'd away. II When we first met, thou wert sporting With the proud ones of the earth, And I thought thee only made for Night of music and of mirth. But thy virtue dwelt in secret, Like a blossom that has furl'd All its sweet leaves, from the notice And the sunshine of the world. I WILL NOT SAY THAT THE WORLD IS GAY. I I will not say that the world is gay, As your youthful fancy paints it; Nor will I snatch the veil away From the hateful stain that taints it: To throw a gloom o'er duty's track, Might make young feet forsake it; While sorrow sleeps, in truth I lack The cruelty to wake it. II Two summer leaves on the stream we'll throw, And watch them stem the current, One floats where tranquil waters flow, One struggles with the torrent: Like this, life's varied tide thou'lt find! But may thy bark float o'er it, Impell'd by fortune's fav'ring wind, And a port of peace before it. I HAVE ROAMED THE WORLD OVER. I I have roam'd the world over, to moisten my lip With the Lethe that banishes care, I have sought Pleasure's banquet halls, eager to sip The draught that invited me there. But I could not forget thee! my features were flush'd By the cup I so madly had drain'd, Yet still though the voice of my sorrow was hush'd, Its feeling acutely remain'd. II So I flew from the mansions of mirth in disgust, And to Learning's dim cloister I turn'd, Unwearied I drew, from oblivion's dark dust, Her stores while my midnight lamp burn'd. But I could not forget thee! tho' wildly I rush'd To each volume my dark cell contain'd, For still though the voice of my sorrow was hush'd, Its feeling acutely remain'd. I'LL ONLY HEAR THE WORD—FAREWELL! I I'll only hear the word farewell, I will not now be told That when you come again, you'll bring A store of gems and gold. To other friends, who love you less, That promise you may tell; At such a moment, let me hear That one sad word—“Farewell!” II Yes, breathe no other word but that, Unless it be the vow, That promises a safe return, With love as fond as now. Say, you'll be true, though in the halls Of splendour you may dwell, Oh! let me hear you tell me this— Or only say—“Farewell.” IT IS NOT ON THE BATTLE FIELD. I It is not on the battle field That I would wish to die; It is not on a broken shield I'd breathe my latest sigh: And though a soldier knows not how To dread a soldier's doom; I ask no laurel for my brow, No trophy for my tomb. II It is not that I scorn the wreath A soldier proudly wears, It is not that I fear the death A soldier proudly dares. When slaughter'd comrades round me lie, I'd be the last to yield; But yet I would not wish to die Upon the battle field. III When faint and bleeding in the fray, Oh! still let me retain Enough of life to crawl away To this sweet vale again; For like the wounded weary dove, That flutters to its nest, I fain would reach my own dear love, And die upon her breast. NO LOVER COMES TO ME. I Oh! since the rising of the sun, Upon the shore I've stood, To be the first to welcome home A lover, brave and good: But o'er the troubled sea, alas! No lover comes to me. II The waves in thunder lash the strand, The rough wind chills my cheek, And oh, I almost dread to view The vessel that I seek! But o'er the troubled sea, alas! No lover comes to me. III And now the day is almost past, The distant tide grows dark, Yet indistinctly I behold A storm-struck helpless bark! Now o'er the troubled sea, alas! A lover comes to me. IV Is there no hope? will none go forth A fellow man to save? The ocean was his battle-field, The ocean is his grave! And o'er the troubled sea, alas! No lover comes to me. OH! NOT WHEN YOUTH AND JOY ARE THINE. I Oh! not when youth and joy are thine Thou'lt know my love for thee; Others, when sunbeams round thee shine, As loving seem to be: But darker days must come to prove All the deep fervour of my love. II How often, when the vain and gay Have thy attendants been, I shunn'd their smiles and stole away To gaze on thee unseen: In darker days they'll disappear, Then call on me;—I shall be near. OH, LETHE'S STREAM! I Oh, Lethe's stream! too tempting fable, I sigh in vain thy sweets to sip; I yet might smile, were I but able, In thy dark wave to bathe my lip. Oblivion come! each relic stealing, That mem'ry shrines from thy chill breath— Say—where shall grief forget the feeling That wounds her heart?—in death! in death! II Oh, Lethe's stream! thy torrent flows not, To charm the bowl where pleasure dwells; Oh, Lethe's stream! sad monks repose not Beside thy brink, in convent cells; Lift sable cowl—or blooming flowers, Thou'lt find that mem'ry sighs beneath; Say—where shall grief forget the bowers Where she was blest?—in death! in death! ONCE 'TWAS MY HOPE. I Once 'twas my hope, upon this spot, A tender flower to raise, I thought its bloom would be my pride, Through many happy days; But ere the sunbeam's smile had lured Its perfect fragrance forth, Its soft leaves sever'd from the stem Lay trampled on the earth. I sorrow'd all the winter time, And bitter tears I shed, When spring return'd, it found me still A mourner o'er the dead. II But soon I saw the plant arise, And spurn its earthly tomb, More beautiful than when I nurs'd Its infancy of bloom! That holy lesson in my heart I'll treasure up with care, I will not sorrow for the dead With hopeless wild despair; For well I know they will shake off This perishable earth, And boast an immortality Of beauty, joy, and worth. POETS BEWARE. I Poets beware! never compare Woman with ought on earth or in air; Earth may be bright, air may be light, But brightness and lightness in woman unite. Can you suppose eyes are like sloes, Or that her blushes resemble the rose? Where shall we seek for sloes that can speak, Or roses that rival an eloquent cheek? II Surely you ne'er saw lilies so fair As the forehead that peeps thro' the curls of her hair! Surely her lips red rubies eclipse, The coral she wears and the nectar she sips! Birds, in the spring, sweetly may sing, But woman sings better than birds on the wing. Then, poets, beware! never compare Woman with ought on earth or in air. SAY—WHERE IS THE NIGHTINGALE? I Say, where is the nightingale I gave you in the spring? Sweetly in unclouded nights the captive used to sing; Oh! it had the wildest notes that ever yet were heard; Tell me not you've changed it for yon green and scarlet bird! II Better is a gentle voice than a painted cheek; I will have the wood notes wild, you the golden beak; Take discordant beauty hence, I'm for plainer sweets, I will have the nightingale's, you the paroquet's. SONG OF GERALDINE. I Why tell me of my Lover's throne, It hath no charms for me, But say his heart is all my own, And then his Bride I'll be. Though proudly soaring to the sun, The birds behold their king, The eagle, in his mountain nest, In softness folds his wing. II Some love the torrent as it leaps O'er rocks, in wild career, But oh! give me the stream that sleeps In sunshine calm and clear. Let me in solitude receive The smiles that love evince, And to the gazing world I leave The splendour of the prince. SHE WATCHED FOR HIM. I She watch'd for him at dawn, and she watch'd for him at noon, Though well she knew she could not hope to see him come so soon; She could not rest,—but peeping thro' her casement's leafy screen, She watch'd the spot where she was told his form would first be seen. II He came not with the dawn, and he came not with the noon, Nor came he when the sun went down, and rose the silver moon; She could not rest,—but wearily sought her casement still, And watch'd—and listen'd for the sound of horsemen on the hill. III Night pass'd—and morn, — the sun in noontide radiance shone, Far off she saw his waving plume,—he came—but not alone; A smiling bride was by his side,—she heard the bridal strain! Her weary eyes were dim with tears,—she could not look again. THE DAHLIA. I I've heard there once was a terrible fight, For precedence in Flora's bowers; From sprigs of quality turning their back Upon what they deem'd commoner flowers; Oh great was the struggle! exotics toss'd Their aristocratic heads, And many who had been inclined to shoot Were obliged to keep their beds. II The lily had beauty and fashion too, 'Twas own'd that she bore the bell, And the roses are a recherché race, As all by their cuttings may tell; But when the fair dahlia came, she heard A London-pride thus say— “We nobles of botany scorn to herd With the blossoms of Botany Bay!” III But when worth and modesty chance to rise, It matters not whence they came, For 'tis upstart folly himself who points To his former humble name. The dahlia family now we meet In the most select of bowers; Permitted to carry their heads as high As some of the older flowers. THE HEIRESS. I I loved thee for thyself alone, The world reproved my choice; Yet well thou know'st I claimed thee still, With no unsteady voice. They call'd thee fickle;—Oh, how blind Fond woman's love may be! I blamed thee not for broken vows, Rejoicing thou wert free. II My father told me thou wert poor, Improvident, and wild; He said that want and penury Would kill his gentle child. I answer'd not—but secretly I scorn'd the tale he told; And then stole forth to offer thee The heiress and her gold. III My mother said—“I do not heed Thy lover's want of wealth;— But will he fondly cherish thee In sickness and in health? He has the restless eye of one Who leads a roving life; He loves not as thou should'st be loved— Oh! do not be his wife!” IV My father's anger moved me not, Nor yet my mother's tears; Thy fascination wean'd my heart From love—the growth of years! With few and fleeting tears I left The haunts of early youth, And placing this weak hand in thine, I trusted to thy truth. V My chosen dwelling would have been Some undisturb'd retreat; But led by thee, I trod the halls Where pleasure's votaries meet. And if with joy I heard them praise The beauty of thy bride, 'Twas but because I dearly prized My husband's glance of pride. VI But then a dreary time came on— I often wept alone;— And when we met, thy voice had lost Its former gentle tone. I utter'd no complaint—thou knowest I never did repine;— And if my pale cheek chided thee, It was no fault of mine. VII I heard my boasted wealth was spent: I smiled at such a loss; My husband's love was more to me, Far more than hoarded dross. And was it only this that caused The frowns upon his brow? “That wealth has been his bane,”—I cried, “We shall be happy now!” VIII Vain hope! for thou dost shun the home Thy folly rendered poor; I know not how to win thee back,— My cheek has lost its lure. I have no mother now to soothe My sorrows on her breast; And he, whose counsel I despised,— My father—is at rest! IX I do not say I love thee not; No, false one, come what will, Return, and be but kind to me, And I should love thee still! A broken mirror still reflects In every shatter'd part; 'Tis thus love seems but multiplied, In this poor broken heart. I'LL NOT WED A BARON. I I'll not wed a baron, I'll not wed a knight, So let them not woo me, with phrases polite; I know they'd soon think me untutor'd and shy, I covet not splendour: no, trust me, not I. II I'll not wed a soldier, he'll leave me for fame; I'll not wed a sailor, for he'll do the same. On land—under water, they'll perish; but why Should I be a widow, why? no, trust me, not I. III Oh! I will love Henry, for Henry loves me; His rose cover'd cottage my dwelling shall be; He's gone to the city a gold ring to buy, And shall I prove fickle? no, trust me, not I. WE'VE SAIL'D UPON THE WINTRY WAVE. I We've sail'd upon the wintry wave, When out of sight of land; And was our trust the steersman's strength, A mortal's feeble hand? No! hopelessly our bark would drift Before the troubled sea, If, mid the tempest's strife, oh God, We did not trust in Thee! II We've suffer'd grief, yet hope's bright wing Has never yet been furl'd; And was our refuge from despair The friendship of the world? No! hopelessly our bark would drift Before the troubled sea, If, 'mid the tempest's strife, oh God, We did not trust in Thee! TO HELENA, ON HER BIRTHDAY. I. My own true love, my true love! here's health and joy to you, love! A happy year, without a tear, and sweet smiles not a few, love! Of all my anniversaries, I prize your birthday best, And well I may, for 'twas the day that brighten'd all the rest; To this I owe my bliss below—oh, more than that, the love Whose purity my guide may be to happiness above. II. My wedding-day is welcome, but it shines in borrow'd bliss, That day owes all its value to the dear one born on this. In doubt, you are the monitor I scorn not to obey, You are the friend I turn to, when a joy is torn away. In sorrow, I have often feign'd hope's softly soothing tone, Till, striving to subdue your grief, I half forgot my own. And then in bliss—oh! what is bliss, I ask—unless it be To look upon your happiness!—ay, that's the bliss for me! THE HEART THAT I GAVE TO THEE. I The heart that I gave to thee Has never come back to me, For though you may spurn it, You cannot return it, Once chained it can never go free. When beauty I chance to see, Then fain would I bend the knee; But listlessly kneeling, My vow wants true feeling; Ah! where can my poor heart be? II You say that my heart is free To rove like the summer bee, Who when a chill shower Kills one pretty flower, Flies off to a fresh rose tree? But chill'd by a frown from Thee, Ah! what are new charms to me? I lack when I view them The heart to pursue them; Then where can my poor heart be? THE TREASURE. I What doth her precious casket hold? What is her hidden treasure? Can sparkling gems, or burnish'd gold Afford this secret pleasure? She leaves her sisters in the day, From the banquet-board she rises, And from her couch she steals away, To weep o'er what she prizes. II Not gold or jewels doth she keep, Within her secret bower, Bright eyes have seldom learn'd to weep O'er these at any hour. If strangers come—she shuts the lid— Her prize in haste concealing; But sad looks, when the chest is hid, Betray the depth of feeling. III What is this source of secret grief?— Alas! a fatal token! The relic of a foreign chief, An arrow, stain'd and broken! Yes, still a blood-mark stains its tip, Although so oft wept over! And still she presses to her lip The shaft that slew her lover! THE WIDOW. I I cannot love another, I cannot cast aside The dark weeds of a widow, For white robes of a bride. I never more may listen To Love's beguiling voice; The sad heart of the mourner Can make no second choice. II Oh! offer nought but friendship, And I will be your friend; Speak only of the lost one, And mark how I'll attend. His portrait hangs above us— Dare not to breathe love's name; Those dark eyes, could I listen, Would frown upon my shame. III And see my child clings to me, And looks up in my face,— He has no other parent To fondle and embrace. Unconsciously, his finger My wedding-ring hath press'd, As if it were to chide me For smiling on my guest. THERE WAS A BARD IN FEUDAL TIMES. I There was a bard in feudal times, A peasant's only child; And, like his native hills, his rhymes Were beautiful and wild. His harp was made of English oak. And simple where its chords, But what of that—its music spoke The meaning of his words. II Soon noble lords and ladies came To hear the minstrel's lay; Sage, knight, and damsel breath'd his name, The idol of the day. He left his home, and threw aside The harp so dear of old; Within the halls of pomp and pride, He freedom lost for gold. III Now forc'd and feeble was his song, Unsteady was his hand; His spirit had been free too long To bow to stern command. Oh! nature's true simplicity, Seek not the glare of art; 'Tis only when she copies thee, That she can touch the heart! WHAT SHALL BE MY THEME? I What shall be my theme, When I sing to thee, Sitting by the village stream, Under the chesnut tree? Tell me, wilt thou choose A gay or mournful string, Shall love or war inspire my muse, Say what shall I sing? II I'll not sing of war, Such a theme would be Much too sad—a gentle star Watches over thee. Let me hear thy voice, And touch thy own lute's string, And whate'er shall be thy choice, That song will I sing! TAKE YOUR POLITICS HENCE. I Take your politics hence, for one evening at least, Drive that demon of discord away from the feast; To my party the men of all parties may come, If they'll only just leave party feeling at home. The speechless in public are ever, I see, Like orator puffs in a snug coterie; If you name your vile House you will give me offence, Oh, let my house be neutral—take politics hence. II These politics now are become quite a pest; What a fuss ere we venture to ask a new guest! “Mr. E., do you see, would be welcome to me, But then—do you think he'd chime in with Lord G?” So the pleasantest men you must sort and divide, When you find that their politics don't coincide. If you name your vile House you will give me offence, Oh, let my house be neutral—take politics hence. III The ladies are now a political race; They think of their canvass much more than their lace. And instead of soft whispers in private, they each Wish to hear a young man's parliamentary speech! A reforming old Tory, you now may look big, And I'll call myself a Conservative Whig; And we'll tell the fair creatures to talk common sense, For that my house is neutral—take politics hence. THE SONG OF THE DYING BARD. I. My harp! I still hold thee! My feeble hand clings Around thee, to waken The voice of thy strings. That voice was my glory, And now that the skill Of the minstrel must leave me, 'Tis dear to me still. Oh! dearer than ever! My harp, if thou hast One note, I invoke it; The sweetest, the last! II. Ah! well I remember How proudly I nurst My powers in secret, When feeling them first! Now throwing thee from me, Dejected, deprest! Yet dearer than ever! My harp, if thou hast One note, I invoke it, The sweetest, the last! III. 'Tis early to leave thee, 'Tis early to lose The young bard's ambition The wreath of the muse: And feeling within me Fresh fountains of thought, To die—leaving others The triumph I sought. Oh! dearer than ever! My harp, if thou hast One note, I invoke it, The sweetest, the last! THE PILGRIM. I Where is the daring Rover, The brigand of the deep? Can such a restless spirit lie Lull'd into peaceful sleep! His name was a word of terror; His deeds were a theme for song! Where is he now? oh! the Rover's prow Was never at rest so long! II Where is the graceful lover So daintily array'd? So famed above all other youths, For dance and serenade! None question'd the nameless stranger, Beguil'd by his voice and lute; Where doth he stray? oh! the lover's lay Hath never so long been mute! III Behold yon lonely pilgrim In penitential prayer; His hands are folded on his breast, His cheek is pale with care. You look on the graceful lover! You look on the rover chief! 'Tis thus remorse brings a change far worse Than is wrought by time or grief. SHALL WE EVER BE HAPPY AGAIN? I Shall we ever be happy again? Shall we ever wake in the morning, Without the ominous gloom, Which seems the heart's sure warning Of something sad to come? Shall we ever lie down to slumber, Without that thought of care, To-morrow will add to the number Of ills that we must bear? Shall we ever be happy again? II Shall we ever be happy again? Shall we ever in summer hours Walk under the trees near home, And gather the fragrant flow'rs, And talk of bright days to come? Unseen, shall I know I am near thee, By hearing thy cheerful voice? Oh! sing as I used to hear thee, And I shall again rejoice; Shall we ever be happy again? THE DRAWING ROOM. I I must be presented to-day, Lady Susan! I must be presented to-day; I must be presented, or what will my cousin, The Bride, Lady Mackintosh, say? She married a man who was knighted last season, For carrying up an address; If she's a great lady, there can be no reason, My Lady, why I should be less. II Now pray, Lady Susan, don't say that you're poorly, 'Tis plain that you want to withdraw; You've married my brother, and I've a right, surely, To go with my sister-in-law; And though you consider us vulgar relations, Some proper repayment there'll be For Brother Bob's Diamond and Pearl presentations, In this presentation of me. III Look at me, my Lady; 'tis folly to quarrel, You'll own that I'm fit to be seen: My yellow silk petticoat loop'd up with laurel, So elegant—yellow and green! My train of red satin (so very well chosen— 'Twill make a pelisse in the spring); And then my blue feathers! I'm sure, Lady Susan, I must be remark'd by the King. IV A train may look very magnificent, flowing Behind one in folds, I dare say; But as for a hoop! oh! I could not bear going To court in that round about way! My lappet's so useless, I cannot bear buying Three yards—it is quite a take-in; And why did you laugh, when you saw I was tying Them gracefully under my chin? V And what must be done when I stand in the presence? Pray tell—I rely upon you: Must I civilly say, as I make my obeisance: “Your Majesty—how do you do?” To be kiss'd by the King! Lady Susan, assist me, I shall not be fit to be seen! What, kiss me in public! oh, when he has kiss'd me, I sha'nt dare to look at the Queen! THE UNWILLING BRIDE. I The joy-bells are ringing—oh! come to the church: We shall see the bride pass, if we stand in the porch. The bridegroom is wealthy: how brightly arrayed Are the menials who wait on the gay cavalcade; The steeds with the chariots prancing along, And the peasants advancing with music and song! II Now comes the procession: the bridemaids are there, With white robes, and ribbons, and wreaths in their hair. Yon feeble old knight the bride's father must be, And now, walking proudly, her mother we see; A pale girl in tears slowly moves by her side: But where is the bridegroom, and where is the bride? III They kneel round the altar—the organ has ceased, The hands of the lovers are joined by the priest;— That bond, which death only can sever again, Which proves ever after life's blessing or bane! A bridal like this is a sorrowful sight: See! the pale girl is bride to the feeble old knight. IV Her hand on her husband's arm passively lies, And closely she draws her rich veil o'er her eyes; Her friends throng around her with accents of love: She speaks not—her pale lips inaudibly move. Her equipage waits—she is placed by the side Of her aged companion—a sorrowing bride! V Again the bells ring, and the moment is come For the young heart's worst trial, the last look of home! They pass from the village—how eagerly still, She turns and looks back from the brow of the hill! She sees the white cottage—the garden she made— And she thinks of her lover, abandoned—betrayed! VI But who, with arms folded, hath lingered so long To watch the procession, apart from the throng? 'Tis he, the forsaken! The false one is gone— He turns to his desolate dwelling alone; But happier there than the doom that awaits The bride, who must smile on a being she hates! APOLLO AND DAPHNE. I Apollo from Olympus stray'd, Enchanted by a mortal maid, Who fled from the intruder. Her coyness, as is oft the case, But gave new ardour to the chase, And so he still pursued her! II One year he followed, and she flew! (A life of misery, she knew, An ill assorted match meant.) Jove changed her to a laurel tree; And so Apollo's proved to be An evergreen attachment! III Too deeply rooted may be thought Poor Daphne's dread of being caught, But do not miss the moral: She seems to say, “Receive, young bard, “From woman's praise your best reward, From woman's smile your laurel.” MY HEART IS NOT YET BROKEN! I My heart is not yet broken, The harp not yet unstrung! “Despair!” hath not been spoken, Though trembling on my tongue! Though fate hath now bereft me Of blessings—past recall; I mourn not, she hath left me Thy love, more dear than all! II My heart too well remembers My boyhood's home of mirth, Methinks I see the embers Still blazing on the hearth! My song of youth—I hear it Still echo thro' the hall! 'Tis gone—but I can bear it! Thy love atones for all. III A stranger owns the meadow. The scene of sportive plays, The trees, beneath whose shadow I pass'd bright summer days: O'er fond hopes crush'd, so early, Some secret tears must fall— But loving thee so dearly, Thy love atones for all. FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH WILL I CALL UPON THEE. I From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee! From the mountain, the valley, the forest the sea; Where the foot of the wanderer never yet trod, The heart of the christian may commune with God! Where ignorance bends the idolatrous knee,— From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee! II I will call upon thee in prosperity's day, Lest the pride of this world lead my spirit astray; I will call upon thee in distress, that my tears May atone for the faults and the follies of years; That purer and brighter the future may be, From the ends of the earth I will call upon thee! III I will call upon thee, as I did when I knelt In the home on the hills, where in boyhood I dwelt; I will call upon thee, if now fated to roam, And the land of the stranger will offer a home, Affection's sweet solace I gratefully see,— From the ends of the earth will I call upon thee! CUPID AND PSYCHE. I Nightly to Psyche's fairy bower, The god of Love in darkness came; But left her, e'er the sunrise hour Betray'd his features and his name; Said Cupid “Oh! remember this, Thy lover's form thou ne'er must see.” Then fondly whisper'd with a kiss— “Beware of curiosity!” II But mortal woman never yet From such a sentence warning took; And more and more, each time they met, She long'd upon his face to look: And once on tip-toe, while he slept, To fetch her lamp she lightly trod, Then back again the trembler crept, And hung enamour'd o'er the god. III A spark fell on his breast! he stirr'd— Ah! what could little Psyche say? Young Love, without one parting word, Waved his light wings, and flew away! The moral, ladies, pray remark,— Whate'er the mystery may be, If love would keep you in the dark, Beware of curiosity. THEY HAVE SEEN BETTER DAYS. I They have seen better days, you say, Oh, tell me when and where; Give me the clue to steal away The memory of their care. There is deep feeling in the tone Of that most touching phrase; And sympathy has tears for one Who has seen better days. II But they, in their small dwelling-place, Give no complainings vent; Their features wear no sullen trace Of gloomy discontent. Most cheerful when alone, they seek For no external rays; And though of past days oft they speak, Scarce call them better days. III Have they endur'd neglect or wrong, And known diminish'd wealth? Light evils; if to them belong Love, competence, and health. They who hang hopeless o'er the couch, Where beauty's bloom decays, May feel despairing thoughts approach, And weep for better days. HE KNEW SHE NEVER BLAMED HIM. I He knew she never blamed him, He knew she seldom nam'd him. He saw her mild forgiving look, A look that half reclaim'd him. But from his victim flying, He basely left her dying, Without a friend, to kneel beside The couch where she was lying. II And does he now regret her? Yes—striving to forget her, His truant thoughts fly back again To scenes where first he met her. In dreams, as in a mirror, He trembling sees with terror A pure heart led to grief and shame, The penalty of error. III None know the thoughts that grieve him; The fairest maids receive him, And listen to his flattering voice; Alas! will they believe him? Yes! though his guilt be greater, Though shame and death await her, Who feels a lover's treachery, Oh! who will shun the traitor? NO, NO, LEAVE ME NOT TO MY SORROW. I No, no, leave me not to my sorrow, With silence the nurse of despair, Oh! come to me still, let me borrow From thee an oblivion of care. Oh! come with thy light-hearted laughter, For there's such a charm in its tone, Like music, 'twill haunt me long after Thy form from my dwelling is gone. II Oh! come with thy memory's treasures, Thy stories and snatches of song, Oh! tell of thy innocent pleasures, I never can listen too long. Oh! come, though desponding thou'lt find me, I'll smile e'er I see thee go forth, I want thy gay voice to remind me There's happiness still upon earth. III Alas! there's a time when dejection Would breathe the wild words of despair, Were it not for the veil which affection Throws over the records of care. Then come with thy light-hearted laughter, For there's such a charm in its tone, Like music 'twill haunt me long after Thy form from my dwelling is gone. THE FASHION OF THIS WORLD PASSETH AWAY. I The fashion of this world passeth away, The things that are fairest are first to decay; The bell of the lily, the leaf of the rose; The moss on the bank where the violet grows; All these are too sweet and too fragile to stay: For the fashion of this world passeth away. II But mourn not the doom of inanimate things; See thy favourite bird with its beautiful wings; Thy dog full of instinct that courts a caress, And scarcely wants language his love to express; The steed thou art proud of—all—all must decay: For the fashion of this world passeth away. III And were we not born for a worthier end, Than to love him, and lose him; oh! what were a friend! The fond heart looks forth from its pilgrimage here, To a meeting more blest in a happier sphere. For this we must watch, and for this we must pray: Since the fashion of this world passeth away. I'LL NAME THE PLACE. I I'll name the place, I'll name the hour, Then come—for 'tis a last farewell; The place shall be the myrtle bower, The time, when sounds the vesper bell. We will not meet as oft we've met, Nor part, as oft we've parted there, Endearing words may breathe regret, But silent tears express despair. II I know that some to soothe thy pain Would say that we again shall meet; But no, my eyes, that cannot feign, Would soon betray my tougue's deceit. Thou shalt be hopeless—I am so, And rather would I know my doom, Than smile, when friends for ever go, And watch—tho' they will never come. III And some, to give thy heart relief, A parting interview would shun. As if it could be a less grief, To ask for me when I am gone! Oh no, I've nam'd the place, the hour, Then come, for 'tis a last farewell; The place shall be the myrtle bower, The time, when sounds the vesper bell. THOU SHALT LAUGH ALL THE HEATHEN TO SCORN. I Thou shalt laugh all the heathen to scorn, Thou shalt baffle the hopes of the proud; Thou shalt tear from the worldly the mask he has worn To dazzle the eyes of the crowd. Not a refuge exists in the world, Where guile from thy vengeance can turn, From his strong-hold, the wretch at thy bidding is hurl'd: Thou wilt laugh all the heathen to scorn. II If thou sendest thy pestilence forth, It will fly on the wings of the wind; It will pass to the uttermost parts of the Earth, And level whole hosts of mankind! If in terror he seek thee at length, Thou wilt not from the penitent turn, But woe to the mortal who trusts his own strength: Thou wilt laugh all the heathen to scorn. OH! YOUTH IS THE TREASURE. I Oh, youth is the treasure, gay youth is the treasure, That gives the true lustre to silver and gold; When young, the mere feeling of life is a pleasure, A feeling that turns to a sorrow when old! If youth in his path should encounter a dolour, He'll pass it by briskly, and bid it adieu; He'll gaze thro' a glass of a beautiful colour, And all the wide world will look beautiful too! II Is this then the lesson philosophy gives us? Is youth to be coupled with pleasure alone? Ah no—let us think that when one season leaves us, The other will boast some calm joys of its own. If wandering youth his foot now and then places On stepping stones, prudence will lay in his track, Of his journey, when over, there still will be traces, On which age will often look tranquilly back. I'LL NOT BELIEVE IT. I I'll not believe love's wreath will pain The hands that weave it; That when no summer flow'rs remain, Love's wreath becomes a galling chain: I'll not believe it! II I'll not believe man wins a heart, To pain and grieve it; That when sad tears unbidden start, The once fond lover will depart: I'll not believe it! III I'll not believe a hope he'll raise, But to deceive it; That in the wane of wedded days, He'll slight the smile love used to praise: I'll not believe it! THE EXHIBITED DWARF. I I lay without my father's door, a wretched dwarfish boy; I did not dare to lift the latch, I heard the voice of joy. Too well I knew, when I was near, my father never smiled; And she who bore me turn'd away, abhorring her poor child. II A stranger saw me, and he bribed my parents with his gold! Oh! deeper shame awaited me—the dwarfish boy was sold! They never loved me, never claim'd the love I could have felt! And yet, with bitter tears, I left the cottage where they dwelt. III The stranger seem'd more kind to me, he spoke of brighter days; He lured each slumb'ring talent forth, and gave unwonted praise; Unused to smiles, how ardently I panted for applause! And daily he instructed me—too soon I learned the cause. IV I stood upon his native shore; the secret was explain'd; I was a vile, degraded slave, in mind and body chain'd! Condemn'd to face, day after day, the rabble's ruffian gaze; To shrink before their merriment, or blush before their praise! V In anguish I must still perform the oft-repeated task; And courteously reply to all frivolity may ask. And bear inhuman scrutiny, and hear the hateful jest! And sing the song—then crawl away to tears instead of rest. VI I know I am diminutive, ay, loathsome, if you will; But say, ye hard hearts! am I not a human being still? With feelings, sensitive as yours perhaps, I have been born! I could not wound a fellow man, in mockery, or scorn! VII But some there are, who seem to shrink away from me at first, And then speak kindly; to my heart that trial is the worst! Oh, then I long to kneel to them, imploring them to save A hopeless wretch, who only asks an honourable grave! WE MUST FOLLOW TO THE TOMB. I We must follow where they lead, We must follow them with speed; Upon that unknown path From which, once enter'd, none recede. We must follow those who now repose, Too early snatched away; And some who saw life's ling'ring close In age and in decay. We must follow, we must follow, For the ground we tread is hollow; We must follow on the unknown path, How early,—who can say? II We must follow to the tomb, We must follow thro' the gloom That veils the dread futurity Of man's immortal doom! We must follow all we'd fain recal— Yet ne'er on earth shall see; For mortal ties shall ne'er enthral The spirit once set free. We must follow, we must follow, &amp;c. THE FIRST CREATED MORTAL. I The first created mortal In Eden's beauteous garden stood; He raised his eyes, To the cloudless skies, And then around; And nought he found That did not prove How boundless his Creator's love. To him the earth was paradise, Without a grief, without a vice. By one so pure, no care was known, And all things that he looked upon Were beautiful and good. II Can earth have been his Eden? Can man have been so pure, so blest? Oh marvel not At his alter'd lot. But probe within The secret sin, And then thou'lt see The source of all his misery. Yet earth might still seem paradise, Could man forsake the path of vice; Content, awhile, to linger here, Though panting for a brighter sphere, The Christian's place of rest. THE FORSAKEN TO THE FALSE ONE. I I dare thee to forget me! go, wander where thou wilt, Thy hand upon the vessel's helm, or on the sabre's hilt; Away! thou'rt free! o'er land and sea go rush to danger's brink! But oh, thou canst not fly from thought! thy curse shall be—to think! II Remember me! remember all my long-enduring love That link'd itself to perfidy; the vulture and the dove! Remember in thy utmost need I never once did shrink, But clung to thee confidingly; thy curse shall be—to think! III Then go! that thought would render thee a dastard in the fight, That thought, when thou art tempest-tost, will fill thee with affright! In some vile dungeon may'st thou lie, and, counting each cold link That binds thee to captivity, thy curse shall be—to think! IV Go! seek the merry banquet hall, where younger maidens bloom, The thought of me shall make thee there endure a deeper gloom; That thought shall turn the festive cup to poison while you drink, And while false smiles are on thy cheek, thy curse will be—to think! V Forget me! false one, hope it not! when minstrels touch the string, The memory of other days will gall thee while they sing; The air I us'd to love will make thy coward conscience shrink— Ay, ev'ry note will have its sting, thy curse will be—to think! VI Forget me! no, that shall not be! I'll haunt thee in thy sleep, In dreams thou'lt cling to slimy rocks that overhang the deep; Thou'lt shriek for aid! my feeble arm shall hurl thee from the brink, And when thou wak'st in wild dismay, thy curse will be—to think! WIT AND FOLLY. I Once Folly tried to cheat the world, Assuming Wit's demeanour, And thought (poor fool!) the dart she hurl'd Than Wit's own darts were keener! While those of Wit were used in sport, And dipp'd in Pleasure's chalice; Young Folly us'd another sort, Whose only point was malice. II A sly and secret aim she took, But ere one heart was wounded, Upon herself, by some ill luck, Each venom'd shaft rebounded. So wisdom ventured to express This gentle hint to guide her: “When Wit takes aim with most success, Good nature stands beside her.” I HAVE NOT KNOWN THEE LONG. I I have not known thee long, Sir Knight, Yet oft I've heard thy name; For in our village we delight To trace a hero's fame. I've thought of thee, I'll not deny, Until I seem'd to know The very glance of that dark eye Which awed my country's foe. II Yet never lightly prize the heart That seems so lightly won; 'Tis surely a dissembler's part, That which we love, to shun! And I'd dissemble, if I'd thought Such guile thou wouldst approve; But no!—the maid, that you have sought, Must glory in your love. III I'll follow you throughout the world, To danger or to death; But should we see the banner furl'd, The weapon in its sheath, We'll rove as fondly to the last, And hand in hand we'll roam, As if our days had all been past Within a peaceful home. SIR HUGH IS GONE TO PALESTINE. I Sir Hugh is gone to Palestine, to fight the Paynim foe, Oh! Ladies should have fortitude, when Lords are forc'd to go; And Lady Kate well knows this truth, a beauteous dame is she, And smiling in her solitude, if solitude it be. Her casement overlooks the sea, and there she sits all day— Oh! is it not to sorrow o'er her plighted Lord's delay? And nightly burns a taper there; oh! is it not to guide The vessel of her plighted Lord across the stormy tide? II Sir Hugh is gone to Palestine, and there he must remain: Oh, Lady fair! thy watchful days, thy beacon light, are vain; And yet they say, within the bay, another light is seen, Borne nightly by a stranger bark—what can such signal mean? Conceal'd beneath the battlement, there is a secret gate, Known only to the castle's Lord, and to his plighted mate; Until her own dear Lord's return, shall other hands be taught To touch the secret spring?—Away—we spurn the hateful thought! III Again she lights her taper, and looks forth upon the deep— No answer from the stranger bark!—why, Lady, dost thou weep? That signal at the secret gate!—she throws it open wide— And instantly a knight in arms is standing at her side: “Oh, Edgar, art thou come at last! nay, speak to me”—she cries— His helm is rais'd!—she shrinks before those dark indignant eyes! Sir Hugh is come from Palestine! he spurns his plighted bride, And Edgar's life-blood mingles with the ocean's ebbing tide. COME, WE'LL HAVE NO FROWNS TO DAY. I Come, we'll have no frowns to-day, If you'll listen I will play; I will sing love's lightest lay, I will chase your gloom away. Come we'll have no frowns, &amp;c. II I will twine a dewy wreath, Buds of rose, and bells of heath, Where the violets repose, Where the fragrant lily grows. Come we'll have no frowns, &amp;c. III I will rifle ev'ry bower, I will gather ev'ry flower; At your feet my store I'll shower: Come we'll have no frowns, &amp;c. I LOVED HIM, BUT I LEFT HIM. I I loved him, but I left him! 'twas a cruel day for me, They said he had another bride who dwelt far o'er the sea; They said I was no wife to him, altho' I bore his name; And I left him, tho' I loved him; oh! was I then to blame? I heard him spurn the rumour, how happy was my heart; I bade him prove his innocence, and urged him to depart; And as he went, I smiling said: “I have not been deceiv'd; “Oh, say thou hast no other wife!”—He said—and I believ'd! II He kiss'd me when he left me, and his tears fell on my cheek. I bade him call me “Wife” again—he wept—and could not speak; I saw him go without a tear, tears would have look'd like dread, And if misgivings chill'd my heart, still not one tear I shed! I smiling wav'd my hand to him, as on the beach I knelt, I veil'd from ev'ry friendly eye the agony I felt; 'Twas in the solitude of home that secretly I griev'd, For one whose truth I would have given worlds to have believ'd. III He came not—and he comes not—and I look not for him now; I am no bride—altho' I heard him breathe a bridal vow; I am not guilty, yet I shun the eyes of all I meet, And feel like a deceiver, tho' the victim of deceit! He has another happy home—my story, whisper'd there, Might teach a fond confiding heart to doubt,—and to despair! Oh, may she never hear my name! may he be still believ'd; And never see the grave of her, who loved—and was deceiv'd! LEA'S BRIDAL DAY. I “To-morrow is my bridal day,” the lovely Lea cries, And gazes from her casement on the calm and starry skies; “To-morrow is my bridal day, and I shall bid farewell, “To the home so very dear to me, where my little sisters dwell. “Oh! bring my bridal garments here, such thoughts will make me weep; “The showy robe—the jewell'd chain—I'll see them ere I sleep; “And come, my little sisters, kneel beside me while I pray; “Why are my spirits thus depress'd, so near my bridal day?” II The night is past—and Lea stands before the casement now, Her hands press back the raven curls from off her marble brow. She gazes like a trembling child, by midnight visions scared, For some inevitable ill, some coming grief, prepared! Her sisters bring her bridal robe, her jewels, and her wreath, She heeds them not, but watches still the path across the heath: They tell her it is time to dress, she motions them away, And whispers: “Let me have my will upon my bridal day.” III It is the bridal hour, and the guests are at the gate; What gloom pervades the festival? the bridegroom is too late! The bridemaids in their gayest robes are all assembled there; But the bride is pale and unadorned—the statue of despair! “He comes! he comes!” at length she cries, “I have not watch'd in vain!” They bear a lifeless bridegroom in, and by his rival slain: A bride scarce living waits for him—“The rites no more delay, “I dying plight my troth to him—'tis still my bridal day!” 'TWAS THIS—'TWAS THIS. I It was a recollection Of a brighter time than this; Of a season when affection Gave to me her fondest kiss. 'Twas thinking of the changes, Doom'd to all beneath the sun; Of the coldness that estranges Hearts that seem'd to beat like one. 'Twas this, 'twas this, believe me, Made me turn away from you, Lest the chilling thoughts that grieve me Should bring grief to others too. II I know you will reprove me; You will say, as oft you've said, The friends who truly love me, Love me most when tears are shed! But no,—I must conceal them, For my sorrows lie too deep; And the kindness meant to heal them Is so sure to make me weep! 'Tis this, 'tis this, believe me, Made me turn away from you, Lest the chilling thoughts that grieve me Should bring grief to others too. NEW FACES. I Oh give me new faces, new faces, new faces! I've seen those around me a fortnight or more; Some people grow weary of things or of places, But persons to me are a much greater bore. I care not for features—I'm sure to discover Some exquisite trait in the first that you send, My fondness falls off when the novelty's over— I want a new face for an intimate friend. II My heart is as genial as Italy's summers, Attachments take root, and grow green in a day; Like bloom on the plum, there's on all the newcomers A charm, that must sooner or later decay. The latest arrival seem'd really perfection, But now, for some reason I can't comprehend, She wearies me so, I must cut the connexion; I want a new face for an intimate friend. III To-day, I may utter a tender expression, To one I to-morrow may probably drop; But friendships should come “hot and hot,” in succession, Just like mutton-pies at a pastrycook's shop; The gardener, too, with new crops is provided, When one crop of marrowfats comes to an end; And why should my new crop of friends be derided? I want a new face for an intimate friend. IV Mamma would persuade me my friends do not vary, But that I have fickle vagaries forsooth! Discernment ought not to be called a vagary, I deem it a virtue precocious in youth. “Be civil,” she says, “to a common acquaintance; Rash friendships are sure prematurely to end.” Oh, cold hearts may credit so frigid a sentence! I want a new face for an intimate friend. V I am not to blame, if I seize the most striking, And very best points about people at first; I am not to blame, if they outlive my liking, And leave me at leisure to point out the worst. I am not to blame, if I'm somewhat less gracious To some I so fluently used to commend; To feel that they bore me is really vexatious! I want a new face for an intimate friend. VI When Mrs. A. came here, my joy was uncommon, I never was happy when not by her side; “Oh! what an agreeable, sweet little woman! She will be a great acquisition,” I cried. I called there so often, so fondly I sought her, My calling so seldom I fear must offend; But, dear me, she's not half so nice as I thought her! I want a new face for an intimate friend. VII When Mrs. B. came, I forgot her completely, For we became just like two leaves on one stalk. She looked and she spoke so uncommonly sweetly, Unless we met daily, how dull was my walk! I thought that her manners were simply enchanting, But now—what false colours can novelty lend! A slight indescribable something is wanting; I want a new face for an intimate friend. VIII Miss D. was delightful, till Mrs. E. prov'd her, By force of comparison, flaunting and free; Then came Lady F.—Oh, how fondly I lov'd her, Until I was dazzled by dear Mrs. G.! Oh give me new faces, new faces, new faces! Let novelty sweeten each sample you send; A fortnight would rub off all grace from the Graces; I want a new face for an intimate friend. NEW YEAR'S DAY. I Another year is passed away, Blithe sounds I hear, gay forms I see; To some this is a joyful day; It brings no joy to me. II Whilst others hope that future years May be unclouded as the last, I dread the future, and with tears Look back upon the past. III To them the dawning year may give A scene of joy, a place of rest; Whilst all for whom they wish to live Are living, and are blest. IV But I possess no cheering thought Of present or of future bliss; The former year that sorrow brought Which cast a gloom on this. V The festive scene which Christmas brings, When music, mirth, and dance combine, Must all be melancholy things To hearts oppressed like mine. VI They call to mind the festive scene, The pleasures of a former year; They tell us too what might have been, Had one we loved been here. VII And when around us we remark Each gaudy dress, each gay pursuit; Our mournful garb appears more dark, Our sorrows more acute. ASK NOT THE COLOUR OF MY ROSA'S EYES. Ask not the colour of my Rosa's eyes; Who can describe the tints of evening skies, When the mind soars beyond each outward hue, To something purer which it loves to view? Ask not the shade of Rosa's curling hair— It is a nameless grace that triumphs there. The shape of Rosa's mouth you may not trace, That source of half the beauty of her face; Those lips of coral, where expression lies, And rivals e'en the magic of her eyes; Her smile more gentle than the dimpling deep, When the wind whispers ere it falls asleep. 'Mid summer's buds, and autumn's fruits, you'll seek In vain, for blooms to match her blushing cheek. LOVE HAS BEEN THERE. I Love has been there; those dark eyes speak Of sad and hopeless hours; On that young cheek, In vain we seek The bloom of youthful flowers. Though o'er thy form gay robes may flow, Though gems adorn thy hair, They hide not woe; Too well we know Love has been there. II Can one so young—so very young, Have lost the smiles of youth? Hath falsehood sung, With artful tongue, Too well dissembling truth? Have blissful thoughts allured thee on, And faded when most fair? The look, the tone Of bliss are gone;— Love has been there. III I met thee first one happy night, With him who smil'd on thee; Thy step was light, Those eyes were bright, And gay and kind was he. The youth is gone—he left behind The step, the glance of care; How changed I find Thy form, thy mind! Love has been there. IV They say that men have never died, When love's first dream they lost. That woman's pride Can turn aside The shaft that wounds her most: That love ne'er kills—it may be so, And death may shun despair; But tears will flow, And well we know Love has been there. THE DARGLE. I Forget not the dargle, forget not the shade, Where we varied the day with dance, music, and song; Where the trees o'er our heads a green canopy made, And the sun never shone on us all the day long. II Look forth from our shady retreat, on the hills Sloping down to the rivulet gushing below; And own, that such valleys, green alleys, and rills, Will be worth recollecting wherever you go. III The leaves seem to slumber, and nothing is heard Save the murmurs delightfully breathing around; The bleatings of sheep, and the songs of a bird, And the river's perpetual lullaby sound. IV And see the Gilt Spear in the sun-beams is bright, The mists from its summit have melted away; It soars, like an eagle, to bask in the light Of evening's last tint, and morn's earliest ray. V Look down on the waters, how brightly they run From their beautiful cradle, the depths of Loch Bray; Now lost in the copse-wood, and now in the sun Shining forth with a ripple, and gliding away. A GENT. IN DIFFS. I A gentleman in difficulties, what is he to do? His wife has sought the English shore, he fain would seek it too. But there, alas! he's liable to writ, arrest, and dun, So he assumes a servant's suit, all other suits to shun. A gentleman in difficulties, what is he to do? A gent. in diffs, a gent. in diffs! what, what's he to do? II And is it not a difficulty, when he fain would eat, To stand behind a chair, and take the covers off the meat! To hand the soup, to hand the wine, to long in vain for both, And find, tho' poor, his way of life is not from hand to mouth. A gentleman in difficulties, &amp;c. III And can there be a difficulty, as you walk along, To know the man who dreads to meet his tailor in the throng? In cloak so closely muffled up, his flitting form you view; These wraps betray his malady is tic, tic-douloureux! A gentleman in difficultics, &amp;c. IV And would you sooth his difficulties, sing in accents sweet, “The sea, the sea, the open sea,” but never name the Fleet. A rest in vain you offer him on this side Dover Cliffs; Arrest (especially the Bench) dismays the gent. in diffs. A gentleman in difficulties, &amp;c. INCONSTANCY. I The fickle rays of April days An early rose-bud nourish'd; Soon chill'd by frost, its leaves it lost, And faded—ere it flourish'd. In vain the noon of sultry June Each kindred bud uncloses; Its withered bough, neglected now, Is left for other roses. II How like the rose, alas! are those, Who nourish thoughts that grieve them; Who pledge their truth, in early youth, To lovers who deceive them. How like the blights of April nights Is he, who, truth professing, Inconstant proves to one who loves, A faithful heart distressing. III How like the days, when brightest rays Conceal the storms that gather, Are smiling eyes, where falsehood lies, Love's fondest hopes to wither. The wounded heart, its keenest smart, In solitude may smother; It may regret the wrongs it met, But cannot love another. THE FATHERLESS. I “Come hither, 'tis thy father, boy! Receive him with a kiss.” “Oh, mother, mother! do not jest On such a theme as this: Though I was but a little child, How bitterly I cried, And clung to thee in agony, When my poor father died.” II “Come, child, this is no time to weep, Partake thy mother's joy! The husband of my choice will prove A parent to my boy.” “Oh, mother, mother! say not so, I cast no blame on thee, But yon gay stranger cannot feel A father's love for me.” III “Come, boy, 'tis for thy sake I wed.” “No, mother, not for mine, I do not ask, in all the world, One smile of love save thine: Oh, say why is the widow's veil So early thrown aside: The hateful rumour is not true: Thou wilt not be a bride?” IV “Oh, mother, canst thou quite forget How hand in hand we crept To my own honour'd father's bed, To watch him as he slept. And do you not remember still His fond but feeble kiss?” “Alas! such thoughts but little suit A day—of joy—like this.” V “Of joy! oh, mother, we must part, This is no home for me; I cannot bear to breathe one word Of bitterness to thee. My father placed my hand in thine, And bade me love thee well, And how I love, these tears of shame May eloquently tell. VI “Thou say'st yon stranger loves thy child; I see he strives to please; But, mother, do not be his bride, I ask it on my knees. I used to listen to his voice With pleasure, I confess; But call him husband! and I shrink, Ashamed of his caress. VII “Had I been younger when he died, Scarce conscious of his death, I might perhaps have smiled to see Thy gems and bridal wreath; My memory would have lost a tie, So very lightly link'd, Resigning that dear form, which now Is vividly distinct. VIII “Had I been older,—more inured To this world's cold career, I might have sought a festival To check a filial tear. Gay banners find gay followers— But, from their station hurl'd, The gay forget them, and pursue The next that is unfurl'd. IX “But I am of an age to prize The being, in whom blend The love and the solicitude Of monitor and friend. He plann'd my boyish sports, and shared Each joy and care I felt, And taught my infant lips to pray, As by his side I knelt. X “Yet deem not mine an impious grief; No, mother, thou wilt own With cheerfulness I spoke of him When we have been alone. But bring no other father here; No, mother, we must part! The feeling, that I'm fatherless, Weighs heavy on my heart.” WISHES. I Say, what should be thy first wish, if a fairy said to thee: “Now ask a boon—I'll grant it—whatever it may be;” The first wish of thy heart, I think, may easily be told; Confide in me, deny it not—thy wish would be for gold. II Oh, no! thou art mistaken; that should not be the boon, My thirst for this world's lucre is ever sated soon; The only gold I prize is such as industry hath bought, And gold like that, from fairy hands, would fruitlessly be sought. III Then say, what would thy first wish be? Ambition's laurell'd name? The pride of popularity, the pinnacle of fame? The pamper'd board of luxury, where crowds of menials wait? Thy second wish will still be gold, to furnish forth thy state. IV Ah, no!—the days are long gone by, when such had been my choice; I ask not fame—far more I prize the self-approving voice: My first wish should not be for fame, my second not for gold, But, listen to me patiently, my wishes shall be told. V Oh, give me but a happy home, to share with her I love, Oh, let me from her path of life each anxious care remove And like the sweet days of the past, “may we have days in store,” Oh, give me this, and only this, I'll never ask for more! THE FORSAKEN TO HER FATHER. I Oh! name him not, unless it be In terms I shall not blush to hear: Oh! name him not, though false to me, Forget not he was once so dear. Oh! think of former happy days, When none could breathe a dearer name; And if you can no longer praise, Be silent and forbear to blame! II He may be all that you have heard; If prov'd, 'twere folly to defend: Yet pause, ere you believe one word Breathed 'gainst the honour of a friend. How many seem in haste to tell What friends can never wish to know! I answer—once I knew him well, And then, at least, it was not so. III You say, when all condemn him thus, To praise him leads to disrepute: But, had the world censured us, Father, he would not have been mute! He may be changed, and he may learn To slander friends, as others do: But if we blame him, we in turn Have learnt that hateful lesson too! IV Desertion of myself, his worst, His only crime perhaps may prove! Shall he of all men be the first Condemned, for being false in love? The world has never yet denied Its favour to the falsest heart; Its sanction rather seems to guide The hand again to aim the dart! V You hate him, father, for you know That he was cruel to your child. Alas! I strove to hide my woe, And when you look'd on me, I smil'd. But on my faded cheek appears An evidence of all I've felt: I pray'd for strength, but falling tears Betray'd my weakness as I knelt. VI Oh! hate him not: he must have seen Some error, that was never meant! And love, you know, hath ever been Prone to complain, and to resent! Hate him not, father! nor believe Imputed crimes, till they are proved; And proof should rather make us grieve For one who once was so beloved. THE NEGLECTED CHILD. I I never was a favourite, My mother never smiled On me, with half the tenderness That bless'd her fairer child. I've seen her kiss my sister's cheek, While fondled on her knee; I've turn'd away to hide my tears— There was no kiss for me! II And yet I strove to please, with all My little store of sense; I strove to please, and infancy Can rarely give offence; But when my artless efforts met A cold, ungentle check, I did not dare to throw myself In tears upon her neck. III How blessed are the beautiful! Love watches o'er their birth; Oh, beauty! in my nursery I learn'd to know thy worth; For even there, I often felt Forsaken and forlorn, And wish'd—for others wish'd it too— I never had been born! IV I'm sure I was affectionate— But in my sister's face There was a look of love, that claim'd A smile or an embrace! But when I raised my lip, to meet The pressure children prize, None knew the feelings of my heart— They spoke not in my eyes. V But, oh! that heart too keenly felt The anguish of neglect; I saw my sister's lovely form With gems and roses deck'd; I did not covet them—but oft, When wantonly reproved, I envied her the privilege Of being so beloved. VI But soon a time of triumph came, A time of sorrow too; For sickness o'er my sister's form Her venom'd mantle threw; The features, once so beautiful, Now wore the hue of death, And former friends shrank fearfully From her infectious breath. VII 'Twas then, unwearied, day and night, I watch'd beside her bed, And fearlessly upon my breast I pillow'd her poor head. She lived—she loved me for my care! My grief was at an end; I was a lonely being once, But now I have a friend! A COUNTRY BALL ON THE ALMACK'S PLAN. I Oh! joy to her, who first began A country ball on the Almack's plan! Hogsnorton's queen she walks erect; The ball exclusive and select: Four Ladies Patronesses sit, From morn to-night arranging it; And when you hear the names of all, You'll guess the merits of the ball. Plebeian persons they reject, Hogsnorton balls are so select! II The squire's own lady, Mistress Pearl, Her sister (quite a stylish girl), And then the wife of Mr. Flaw, (Churchwarden, and a man of law,) And Mistress Pitts, the Doctor's bride, Related on the mother's side To Mr. Biggs (who was you know, Lord Mayor of London long ago!) By these, all upstart claims are check'd, Hogsnorton balls are so select! III They've quite excluded Mr. Squills, Who makes the antibilious pills; Not 'cause he makes 'em, but they say He sells 'em in a retail way; But Mr. Squills declares his wife Has seen a deal of stylish life, And votes Hogsnorton people low, So if she could, she wouldn't go— A strange remark, when you reflect Hogsnorton balls are so select! IV And then you know there's Mr. Flinn, The rich old mercer can't get in; And Sweet the grocer has applied! But Sweet the grocer was denied; And both appear to think it hard That Slush the brewer has a card; And say, “Why should a brewer be One bit more fit for hops than we?” But Slush of course is quite correct, Hogsnorton balls are so select! V Of course, all those they won't admit Discuss the ball, and censure it; And strange opinions they express About each Lady Patroness; Says Mrs. Flinn to Mrs. Sweet, “I wash my hands of the élite;” Says Mrs. Sweet to Mrs. Flinn, “For all the world I'd not go in!” Here envious feelings we detect; Hogsnorton balls are so select! VI Says Mrs. Squills, “There's Mrs. Pearl, You'd think her father was an earl! So high and mighty! bless your heart, I recollect her much less smart, Before she married; and I knew That people said—('tis entre nous) She was a leetle indiscreet— So much, my dear, for the élite!” “Dear me! don't say she's incorrect, Hogsnorton balls are so select!” VII Woe, woe to her who first began A country ball on the Almack's plan! Grim war is raging in the town, The men are raving up and down; And, what may lead to worse mishaps, The ladies all are pulling caps; Indeed we hear, from one and all, As much of bullets as the ball! Why was Hogsnorton's comfort wreck'd? Because her balls were so select! SEEING'S NOT BELIEVING. I I saw her as I fancied fair, Yes, fairest of earth's creatures; I saw the purest red and white O'erspread her lovely features; She fainted, and I sprinkled her, Her malady relieving; I wash'd both rose and lily off! Oh, seeing's not believing! II I look'd again, again I long'd To breathe love's fond confession; I saw her eyebrows form'd to give Her face its arch expression; But gum is very apt to crack, And whilst my breast was heaving, It so fell out that one fell off! Oh! seeing's not believing! III I saw the tresses on her brow, So beautifully braided; I never saw, in all my life, Locks look so well as they did. She walk'd with me one windy day— Ye zephyrs, why so thieving? The lady lost her flaxen wig! Oh! seeing's not believing! IV I saw her form, by Nature's hand So prodigally finished, She were less perfect if enlarged, Less perfect if diminished; Her toilet I surprised—the worst Of wonders then achieving: None know the bustle I perceived! Oh! seeing's not believing! V I saw, when costly gems I gave, The smile with which she took them; And if she said no tender things, I've often seen her look them. I saw her my affianced bride, And then my mansion leaving, She ran away with Colonel Jones— Oh! seeing's not believing! VI I saw another maiden soon, And struggled to detain her; I saw her plain enough—in fact, Few women could be plainer. 'Twas said, that at her father's death, A plum she'd be receiving, I saw that father's house and grounds! Oh! seeing's not believing! VII I saw her mother—she was deck'd With furbelows and feathers; I saw distinctly that she wore Silk stockings in all weathers; I saw, beneath a load of gems, The matron's bosom heaving; I saw a thousand signs of wealth: Oh! seeing's not believing! VIII I saw her father, and I spoke Of marriage in his study; But would he let her marry me? Alas! alas! how could he? I saw him smile a glad consent, My anxious heart relieving, And then I saw the settlements; Oh! seeing's not believing! IX I saw the daughter, and I named My moderate finances; She spurn'd me not, she gave me one Of her most tender glances. I saw her father's bank—thought I, There cash is safe from thieving; I saw my money safely lodged; Oh! seeing's not believing! X I saw the bank, the shutters up, I could not think what they meant; The old infirmity of firms, The bank had just stopt payment! I saw my future father then Was ruined past retrieving, Like me, without a single sous: Oh! seeing's not believing! XI I saw the banker's wife had got The fortune settled on her; What cared he, when the creditors Talk'd loudly of dishonour? I saw his name in the Gazette, But soon I stared, perceiving He bought another house and grounds! Oh! seeing's not believing! XII I saw,—yes, plain as plain could be, I saw the banker's daughter; She saw me too, and called for sal- Volatile and water. She said that she had just espoused A rich old man, conceiving, That I was dead or gone to jail! Oh! seeing's not believing! XIII I saw a friend, and freely spoke My mind of the transaction; Her brother heard it, and he call'd, Demanding satisfaction. We met—I fell!—that brother's ball In my left leg receiving; I have two legs—true—one is cork! Oh! seeing's not believing! MY DEJEUNER A LA FOURCHETTE. I What a beautiful day! Had the weather been wet, What a damp on my déjeûner à la fourchette. There is but one drawback, I own, to my bliss— 'Tis late in the year for a party like this; So I've stuck paper roses on every bush, And my garden has got quite a midsummer blush; And I've calico lilies, judiciously set, To embellish my déjeûner à la fourchette. II I've order'd the people to water the road All the way from the town to my rural abode. Till three, I suppose, not a soul will arrive; Bless me! there's a chaise at the end of the drive! 'Tis old Mrs. Smith!—what can bring her so soon? She thinks herself late, too—a breakfast at noon! And dress'd, I protest, in her best tabinet; What a blot on my déjeûner à la fourchette! III Here's a three-corner'd note (how excited I feel!) What an elegant hand! and a coronet seal! From the Duchess, confined to her room with a cough; Had I known, I'd have put my sweet déjeûner off. An excuse from Sir Thomas—“A touch of the gout!” And one from Lord Harry—“Too ill to go out!” I declare I have lost all the cream of the set, That I asked to my déjeûner à la fourchette. IV But the guests are arriving. My villa has got Quite a park-like appearance—a beautiful spot! The singers, equipp'd in a foreign costume, The horns in that arbour, too loud for a room; The band on the lawn in the pretty marquee, This tent for the dinner, and that for the tea; (Though breakfast they call it, no dinner they'll get, Except at my déjeûner à la fourchette). V What's Harris, my butler, attempting to say? Champagne! why we gave out ten dozen to-day! All gone! and the officers calling for more! Go, open the tent for quadrilles, I implore; Go, Harris, and hint we're expecting them soon, And tell Mr. Tweedle to strike up a tune. I'm certain my husband will never forget The cost of my déjeûner à la fourchette. VI 'Tis getting quite dark! that unfortunate breeze Blows out all the lamps that we placed in the trees. The dew is so heavy, my rockets won't go, And my Catherine-wheels are exceedingly slow. But I heed not the darkness; if people are lost, What accounts there will be in the Herald and Post! And 'twill give me éclat, if a Lord is upset On his way from my déjeûner à la fourchette. WHY DON'T THE MEN PROPOSE? I Why don't the men propose, mamma, Why don't the men propose? Each seems just coming to the point, And then away he goes! It is no fault of yours, mamma, That ev'ry body knows; You fête the finest men in town, Yet, oh, they won't propose! II I'm sure I've done my best, mamma, To make a proper match; For coronets and eldest sons I'm ever on the watch: I've hopes when some distingué beau A glance upon me throws; But though he'll dance, and smile, and flirt, Alas, he won't propose! III I've tried to win by languishing, And dressing like a blue; I've bought big books, and talk'd of them, As if I'd read them through! With hair cropp'd like a man, I've felt The heads of all the beaux; But Spurzheim could not touch their hearts, And oh, they won't propose! IV I threw aside the books, and thought That ignorance was bliss; I felt convinced that men preferred A simple sort of Miss; And so I lisp'd out naught beyond Plain “yeses” or plain “noes,” And wore a sweet unmeaning smile; Yet, oh, they won't propose! V Last night, at Lady Ramble's rout, I heard Sir Harry Gale Exclaim, “Now I propose again—” I started, turning pale; I really thought my time was come, I blush'd like any rose; But oh! I found 'twas only at Ecarté he'd propose! VI And what is to be done, mamma? Oh, what is to be done? I really have no time to lose, For I am thirty-one: At balls, I am too often left Where spinsters sit in rows; Why won't the men propose, mamma? Why won't the men propose? A PIC-NIC. I “A pic-nic, a pic-nic! so happy together! Intelligent women, agreeable men! The middle of June, so we must have fine weather; We'll go upon donkeys to Bogglemy Glen. There has not been rain for six weeks, and, at present, There is not the slightest appearance of change; No pic-nic, I'm sure, ever yet was so pleasant— Few people can realize all they arrange!” II Oh! these words at night were the very last spoken, The first in the morning were equally gay; There was a great mist, which we knew was a token At noon we should have a most exquisite day. The donkeys arrive, and the sociable meant for The matrons unfitted for sidesaddle feats; The baskets of prog and the hampers are sent for, And pack'd in the rumbles, or under the seats. III And now we set off—all the carriages quite full: Do look at Miss Symons, how oddly she sits! No sun to annoy us, it's really delightful! Don't mind Mrs. Wilkins, she says that it spits! Some people take pleasure in throwing cold water On parties of pleasure, and talking of damp; She's just the ill-natured old woman I thought her, We'll laugh at her presently when we encamp. IV My donkey, in stooping to gather a thistle, Was very near pitching me over his head; Dear me! I do think it's beginning to drizzle, Oh, let us take shelter in yonder old shed! How foolish to put on my pink satin bonnet! I envy Miss Martin, she's snug in the straw; My lilac pelisse, too! the water drips on it, The loveliest lilac that ever I saw! V For my part, I own I like this sort of morning, With sun perpendicular what could we do? So pleasant to find the dust laid when returning; 'Twill clear up at twelve, or at latest at two. And now we're at Bogglemy, dear, how unlucky! I'm sure I heard something like thunder just then: The place is so gloomy—the path is so mucky— I scarce can believe I'm at Bogglemy Glen! VI We cannot dine under the trees—it would chill us; We'll try to take shelter in yonder retreat: Oh, dear! it's a dirty old cowhouse, 'twill kill us; If all must crowd into it, think of the heat! A soup-plate inverted Miss Millington uses To keep her thin slippers above the wet clay! Oh! see through the roof how the rain-water oozes— The dinner will all taste of dripping to-day! VII A pic-nic, a pic-nic! so wretched together! All draggle-tail women, and cross-looking men! The middle of June, yet this terrible weather Has made a morass of poor Bogglemy Glen! It rains just like buckets of water; at present, There is not the slightest appearance of change: 'Twas very absurd to leave Waterloo Crescent— Few people can realise all they arrange. MY MARRIED DAUGHTER COULD YOU SEE. I My married daughter could you see, I'm sure you would be struck;— My daughters all are charming girls, Few mothers have such luck. My married one—my eldest child— All hearts by magic wins; And my second so resembles her, Most people think them twins! II My married daughter spoils her spouse,— She's quite a pattern-wife; And he adores her—well he may— Few men lead such a life! She ne'er had married mortal man Till he had won her heart; And my second darling's just the same,— They are seldom known apart. III Her husband oft has press'd my hand, While tears were in his eyes And said, “You brought my Susan up— With you the credit lies.” To make her a domestic wife, I own was all my aim; And my second is domestic too,— My system was the same. IV Now, do you know, I've often thought The eldest of the two (She's married, so I may speak out) Would just have suited you! You never saw her?—how shall I My eldest girl portray! Oh! my second is her counterpart, And her you'll meet to-day. MY CREAM-COLOUR'D PONIES. I Go order my ponies; so brilliant a Sunday Is certain to summon forth all the élite; And cits who work six days, and revel but one day, Will trudge to the West End from Bishopsgate-street: See! two lines of carriages almost extending The whole way from Grosvenor to Cumberland Gate; The Duchess has bow'd to me! how condescending! I came opportunely—I thought I was late. II I'm certain my ponies, my cream-colour'd ponies, Will cause a sensation wherever I go; My page, in his little green jacket, alone is The wonder of all! Oh, I hope he won't grow! How young Sir Charles looks, with his hat so well fitted To shew on the left side the curls of his wig! I wonder that yellow post-chaise was admitted; And there's an enormity—three in a gig! III Dear me! Lady Emily bow'd to me coolly; Oh, look at that crazy old family-coach! That cab is a mercantile person's—'tis truly Amazing how those sort of people encroach! Good gracious! the pole of that carriage behind us Is going to enter my phaeton's back! Do call to them, Robert! Oh! why won't they mind us? I hear it! I feel it! bless me, what a crack! IV Don't glance at the crowd of pedestrians yonder, There's vulgar Miss Middleton looking this way. Let's drive down to Kensington Gardens; I wonder We hav'nt met Stanmore this beautiful day. They've upset the Countess's carriage, how frightful! Do look at Sir David—he'll drive here till dark; Let's go where the crowd is the thickest; delightful! My cream-colour'd ponies, the pride of the Park! MY OPERA BOX! I My opera-box, my opera box! You must engage one, Mr. Coxe. What led the daughter of an Earl To link herself to such a churl? The Duke, my uncle, always said Your father had made mints in trade; And that, I thought, ensured your wife The necessary things of life,— And one among them, Mr. Coxe, I always count my opera-box. II My opera-box, my opera-box! 'Tis said sweet music softens rocks: But that to me is not the charm, It is to show my well turn'd arm, As in the front I smiling sit, The admiration of the pit. I nod—I smile—I kiss my hand,— My voice far louder than the band;— Admitting every beau that knocks At thy closed door, my opera-box! III My opera box, my opera box! My sense of right and wrong it shocks, To think that one of birth so low, When I intreat, should answer “No!” Would none but “Lady Betty” do? “Mistress John Coxe” might serve for you! But 'twas your proudest hope to stride With “Lady Betty” at your side; And mine to ope your coffer's locks, And with strong-box buy opera-box. IV My opera-box, my opera-box! Don't talk to me about the stocks, And rents reduced, and in arrear, And money scarce, and all things dear! I'll have my way; her Grace (my aunt) Declares I'm not extravagant; And says we nobles condescend, When thus plebeian coin we spend;— Then be obedient, Mr. Coxe, And go engage my opera-box! THE MAN WITH THE TUFT. I I ever at college From commoners shrank, Still craving the knowledge Of people of rank: In my glass, my lord's ticket I eagerly stuffed; And all call'd me “Riquet,” The man with the Tuft. II My patron—most noble— Of highest degree! Thou never canst probe all My homage for thee! Thy hand—oh! I'd lick it, Though often rebuff'd; And still I am “Riquet,” The man with the Tuft! III Too oft the great, shutting Their doors on the bold, Do deeds that are cutting, Say words that are cold! Through flattery's wicket My body I've stuff'd, And so I am “Riquet,” The man with the Tuft! IV His lordship's a poet, Enraptured I sit; He's dull—(and I know it)— I call him a wit! His fancy, I nick it, By me he is puff'd, And still I am “Riquet,” The man with the Tuft! THE FEMALE OPIUM-EATER. I There was a noble lady, as fair as fair could be, And when she did whate'er she pleased, a gentle dame was she! But when controll'd, her dark eye told of rage within restrain'd, And she ceased to be a gentle dame, until her point was gain'd. Her lover in the city dwelt, full three long leagues away; Her uncle bade her spurn the youth—oh! how could she obey! She nightly wept, she never slept; at length she thought she'd try Anopium draught, which ev'ry morn her page went forth to buy. II “Why daily goes thy page to town?” her noble uncle cries; “To seek the doctor's shop,” says she, “where opium draughts he buys.” “What need hast thou of opium draughts?”—“I'd fain forget the past, And all my foolishness is fading from me fast.” The uncle smiled, well pleased at this, and walk'd away content; And unmolested to the town the page was daily sent; And daily from the town he brought a bottle of small size; His lady snatch'd it from his hand and bore away the prize. III She bore it to her secret bower, and then she turn'd the key, And there were none her words to hear, and none her acts to see; She daily round the bottle found a short sweet sentence traced, She broke the seal, and then began unfolding it in haste, And then she read with throbbing heart, (love's ardour never stops!) Till she devoured the contents (the writing, not the drops): And daily from her casement high the opium draughts did flow, Till on a shelf stood fifty empty bottles in a row! IV Upon that grim and ghastly row the lady's maid did gaze: The footman to their hollowness a wondering glance did raise; The page who saw them, simpering, said, “Alas! 'tis pretty clear, If she takes so much doctor's stuff, she will not long be here!” Her uncle saw the bottles, too, and saw them with affright; He counted them—he scarcely could believe he counted right! “The dose too strong—thoul't dose too long; at counsel do not scoff; Some night, my dear, a drop too much may chance to take thee off!” V Next morn the page went early forth along the well-known track, And soon with the composing draught composedly rode back; A doctor, (it was rumour'd,) muffled up, was by his side, But one beneath the doctor's cloak a soldier's garb espied! That night (by medical advice) the dame tried change of air! This bulletin her uncle read next morning in despair: “The dear departed owns your warning words were true enough, By bottle number fifty-one your niece was taken off!” WHAT, THOUGH WE WERE RIVALS OF YORE. I “What, though we were rivals of yore, It seems you the victor have proved, Henceforth we are rivals no more, For I must forget I have loved. You tell me you wed her to-day, I thank you for telling the worst; Adieu then! to horse, and away!— But, hold—let us drink her health first! II “Alas! I confess I was wrong To cope with so charming a knight; Excelling in dance, and in song, Well-dressed, debonnaire, and polite! So, putting all envy aside, I take a new flask from the shelf; Another full glass to the bride, And now a full glass to yourself! III “You'll drink a full bumper to me, So well I have borne my defeat? To the nymphs who the bridemaids will be, And to each of the friends you will meet You are weary?—one glass to renew; You are dozing?—one glass to restore; You are sleeping?—proud rival, adieu! Excuse me for locking the door. IV There's a fee in the hand of the priest; There's a kiss on the cheek of the bride! And the guest she expected the least Is he who now sits by her side! Oh, well may the loiterer fail, His love is the grape of the Rhine; And the spirit most sure to prevail Was never the spirit of wine! OLD AGE AND YOUTH. I Old Age sits bent on his iron-grey steed; Youth rides erect on his courser black; And little he thinks in his reckless speed, Old age comes on in the very same track. II And on Youth goes, with his cheek like the rose, And his radiant eyes, and his raven hair; And his laugh betrays how little he knows Of Age, and his sure companion Care. III The courser black is put to his speed, And Age plods on, in a quieter way, And little Youth thinks that the iron-grey steed Approaches him nearer every day. IV Though one seems strong as the forest tree, The other infirm, and wanting breath; If ever Youth baffles Old Age, 'twill be By rushing into the arms of Death! V On his courser black, away Youth goes; The prosing sage may rest at home; He'll laugh and quaff, for well he knows That years must pass ere Age can come. VI And since too brief are the daylight hours, For those who would laugh their lives away, With beaming lamps, and mimic flowers, He'll teach the night to mock the day! VII Again he'll laugh, again he'll feast, His lagging foe he'll still deride, Until—when he expects him least— Old Age and he stand side by side! VIII He then looks into his toilet-glass, And sees Old Age reflected there; He cries, “Alas! how quickly pass Bright eyes, and bloom, and raven hair!” IX The lord of the courser black must ride On the iron-grey steed, sedate and slow; And thus to him who his power defied, Old Age must come like a conquering foe. X Had the prosing sage not preach'd in vain, Had Youth not written his words on sand, Had he early paused, and given the rein Of his courser black to a steadier hand. XI Oh! just as gay might his days have been, Though mirth with graver thoughts might blend; And when at his side Old Age was seen, He had been hail'd as a timely friend. DEAR HARP OF OLD ERIN. I Dear Harp of old Erin! let loyalty waken Thy liveliest strain on this festival day: Oh! ne'er may the warmth of our duty be shaken, Oh! ne'er may our patriot feelings decay. Whilst faction is basely or blindly employ'd 'Gainst the laws, which our fathers in honour enjoy'd, Let the loyal exert ev'ry voice, ev'ry nerve, For the land they adore, and the monarch they serve. George the IVth, George the IVth! fill each glass to the brim, This roof shall resound with good wishes to him. II He came to the brightest and greenest of isles, Where the hearts that are warmest exult in his sway; Where if errors exist, hospitality's smiles Have a charm to chase trivial errors away. Yes, he came, where no monarch for ages had stood, Save when arm'd with the terrors of warfare and blood! He landed, without the proud pomp of a court, With the love of his people his shield and support. George the IVth, George the IVth! &amp;c. III Yes, Erin has bless'd him, though cynics may sneer At a zeal and a loyalty foreign to them; Tho' a trace of their national warmth may appear In their welcome, the coldest alone will condemn. Her voice has not bless'd him in vain, she has shown That a bulwark of loyalty circles the throne; And in England, she'll find kindred spirits to share In the union of hearts that bids treason despair. George the IVth, George the IVth! &amp;c. IV Then hail to our sov'reign, we'll show him, with pride, His adherents are now neither feeble nor few, And would rather maintain a dominion long tried Than raise a new system, because it is new. In the cause be all hearts energetic and warm, And the ship may triumphantly weather the storm; In calm or in tempest we'll stand on the deck, And fight for its safety, or sink with the wreck! George the IVth, George the IVth! &amp;c. V When he, who had liv'd in the love of the nation, In solitude pass'd his life's darken'd decline, And to thee had devolv'd his responsible station, His course, and the friends he had chosen, were thine. Thou hast prov'd that a father's designs were more dear Than the sycophants painting thy early career, Those baffled deluders that choice may condemn, The successes it caused have been hateful to them. George the IVth, George the IVth! &amp;c. I BLAME THEE NOT. I Perhaps my tongue but faintly told The tale it scarcely dared to tell. Perhaps you thought my manner cold, Too cold for one who lov'd thee well. I blame thee not, though false thou art, I mourn thy faults, but never blam'd; And though your follies break my heart, I will not hear those follies nam'd. II Why is it, when young hearts adore One faultless mind, one form, one face, If love is cross'd, they love no more, Another ne'er can fill the place? It is because, in after years, We seek its counterpart in vain, Youth quits his dream of love with tears, And trembles ere he trusts again. I MOURN FOR HER I'VE LOST. I Believe me not cold, tho' my bosom refuses One sigh or one thought for the beauties I see, For love cannot visit my heart till it loses All trace of that one that was dearest to me. Unmov'd I view the charms they boast, For midst the forms that dazzle most, I think of her I've lov'd, I mourn for her I've lost. II And if, in their features, my eye faintly traces A likeness of one I still fondly prefer, How vainly I seek in their loveliest graces The mind which gave value the beauty in her. Unmov'd I view, &amp;c. OH THOSE ARE THE ELOQUENT LIPS. I Oh! those are the eloquent lips that can say The tenderest things in the tenderest way; For those are the lips that a poet would choose To warble his songs, and give wings to his muse. It is not the tone or the cadence alone, For others may rival a cadence or tone; Ye gay youths who listen, beware of her spell, For oft in your slumbers you'll hear Isabel. II Oh! how is it then you all others excel? By blending the sense and the music so well, Expression and science in thee are combin'd, The magic of voice with the magic of mind. To each note of the music new charms you impart, While each word of the poetry touches the heart. Ye gay youths who listen beware of her spell, For oft in your slumbers you'll hear Isabel. III Too often the sound throws a veil o'er the words, Unmeaningly sweet like the wild notes of birds, But hearing thee sing ev'ry verse is distinct, And yet with such exquisite melody link'd; The bard of his song half enamour'd might be, But remembers the charm was all given by thee. Ye gay youths who listen beware of her spell, For oft in your slumbers you'll hear Isabel. WHERE IS MY LOVER. I Where is my lover, can any one tell? Where is he gone, where is he gone? He flirts with another, I know very well, And I am all alone! I own that I frown'd when I sent him away, And order'd him not to come near me to-day; But then I'd no notion that he would obey; Where is he gone, where is he gone? I'm sure we girls don't mean half that we say; Oh! I am all alone! II Where is my lover? oh! bring him to me! Where is he gone, where is he gone? I was not aware how distressing 'twould be, Thus to be alone! They tell me to Mary gay presents he brings; They say that he smiles when fair Isabel sings; 'Tis plain that his cupid has two pair of wings; Where is he gone, where is he gone? Oh! his love and mine are two different things, For I am all alone! III Bid him come back to me like a good man; Where is he gone, where is he gone? I will receive him with smiles, if I can, Though I am all alone! Do not permit him to think that I pine; Tell him that many men call me divine; You cannot mistake him, his form is so fine, Where is he gone, where is he gone? They say that his eyes are the image of mine; Oh! I am all alone! THEY DEEM IT A SORROW GONE BY. I They deem it a sorrow gone by, A passion effaced from my heart, But rankling, the poison may lie, When time has extracted the dart. Again, to the dance I have gone, They think that my spirits are high, They see not my tears when alone, They deem it a sorrow gone by. II The smile is again on my cheek, The jest is again on my tongue, I see them exult when I seek The haunts of the gay and the young. They think a new love will atone, For one that but blossom'd to die, They see not my tears when alone, They deem it a sorrow gone by. WRITE ON THE SAND. I Write on the sand when the tide is low, Seek the spot when the waters flow; Whisper a name when the storm is heard, Pause, that echo may breathe the word. If what you wrote on the sand should last, And echo is heard 'mid the tempests blast, Then believe, and not till them, That there's truth in the vows of men. II Throw a rose on the stream at morn, Watch at eve for the flow'rs return, Drop in the ocean a golden grain, Hope 'twill shine on the shore again. If the rose you again behold, If you gaze on your grain of gold, Then believe, and not till then, That there's truth in the vows of men. OF WHAT IS THE OLD MAN THINKING? I Of what is the old man thinking, As he leans on his oaken staff? From the mid-day pastime shrinking, He shares not the merry laugh. But the tears of the old man flow, As he looks on the young and gay: And his grey head, moving slow, Keeps time to the air they play: The elder around are drinking, But not one cup will he quaff, Oh! of what is the old man thinking, As he leans on his oaken staff? II 'Tis not with a vain repining, That the old man sheds a tear; 'Tis not for his strength declining, He sighs not to linger here. There's a spell in the air they play, And the old man's eyes are dim, For it calls up a past May-day, And the dear friends lost to him. From the scene before him shrinking, From the dance and the merry laugh, Of their calm repose he is thinking, As he leans on his oaken staff. SHE WORE A WREATH OF ROSES. I She wore a wreath of roses, The night that first we met, Her lovely face was smiling, Beneath her curls of jet. Her footstep had the lightness, Her voice the joyous tone; The tokens of a youthful heart, Where sorrow is unknown. I saw her but a moment, Yet methinks I see her now, With the wreath of summer flowers, Upon her snowy brow. II A wreath of orange blossoms, When next we met, she wore; The expression of her features Was more thoughtful than before. And standing by her side was one, Who strove, and not in vain, To sooth her, leaving that dear home She ne'er might view again. I saw her but a moment, Yet methinks I see her now, With the wreath of orange blossoms, Upon her snowy brow. III And once again I see that brow, No bridal wreath is there, The widow's sombre cap conceals Her once luxuriant hair. She weeps in silent solitude, And there is no one near To press her hand within his own, And wipe away the tear. I see her broken hearted, Yet methinks I see her now, In the pride of youth and beauty, With a garland on her brow. SOMETHING TO LOVE. I Something to love, some tree or flow'r, Something to nurse in my lonely bow'r, Some dog to follow, where'er I roam, Some bird to warble my welcome home, Some tame gazelle, or some gentle dove: Something to love. Oh, something to love! II Something to love. Oh, let me see! Something that's filled with a love for me; Beloved by none, it is sad to live, And 'tis sad to die and leave none to grieve; And fond and true let the lov'd one prove, Something to love. Oh, something to love! OH! WHEN IT IS TOO LATE. I Oh! when it is too late thou wilt regret me, In vain thou'lt strive to hate, or to forget me; Thy love for me, in vain, thou'lt strive to smother, Yet ne'er wilt thou again so love another. Ah! when it is too late, thou wilt regret me, In vain thou'lt strive to hate, or to forget me. II Ah! when it is too late, and I'm forsaken, Affection, once so great, will reawaken, And then thou wilt renounce the spells around thee, And sigh for ties that once so fondly bound thee. Oh! when it is too late, thou'lt regret me, In vain thou'lt strive to hate, or to forget me. 'TIS MIDNIGHT. I 'Tis midnight, and sweet melodies Are wafted o'er the tide, From one of those bright pleasure barques, That on the waters glide. Gay lords are there And ladies fair, Along the ship They lightly trip; I envy not their revelry While roving by thy side. II Behold the moonbeams darting through The green transparent tree; And hear the light leaves answering The whispers of the breeze. When winter throws Her chilling snows, O'er all the earth, Then give me mirth, But oh! the dance was never meant For summer nights like these. WHEN YOU AND I WERE BOYS TOGETHER. I When you and I were boys together, 'Ere care's first cloud o'ershadow'd either; When, to the young and joyous spirit, The gayest friend had highest merit: Oh! life seem'd made of sunny weather, When you and I were boys together! II Then, if we heard of war and glory, Our young hearts panted at the story; We paus'd not gravely to consider What cause was right, or who was leader; We sigh'd for sword, and helm, and feather, When you and I were boys together! III We felt the dull restraint that bound us, We saw free manhood busy round us; And dazzled by his hoarded treasure, And tempted by the song of pleasure, Oh! how we long'd to break our tether; When you and I were boys together! IV How false the view by fancy painted, When we and life are first acquainted; How oft, alas! by storms surrounded, The weary spirit has desponded, And sighed for that more sunny weather, When you and I were boys together! SHE WOULD NOT KNOW ME. I She would not know me, were she now to view me; My heart was gay, when long ago she knew me; My songs were daily tun'd to some gay measure, And all my visions were of future pleasure. Oh! tell her not that grief could thus o'erthrow me, But let her pass me by, she will not know me! II In these sad accents, she will ne'er discover The cheerful voice of him who was her lover; Nor will these features, in their gloom, remind her Of the gay smile they wore, when she was kinder. Oh! tell her not that grief could thus o'erthrow me, But let her pass me by, she will not know me! III 'Twould pain her, did she note my deep dejection, To know that she had crush'd such fond affection; And not for all the world, shall my distresses Chase from her heart the joy it still possesses! Oh! tell her not that grief could thus o'erthrow me, But let her pass me by, she will not know me! THE OLD HOUSE AT HOME. I Oh! the old house at home where my forefathers dwelt, Where a child at the feet of my mother I knelt, Where she taught me the pray'r, where she read me the page, Which, if infancy lisps, is the solace of age; My heart, 'mid all changes, wherever I roam, Ne'er loses its love for the old house at home! II Twas not for its splendour, that dwelling was dear! 'Twas not that the gay or the noble were near; O'er the porch the wild rose and woodbine entwin'd, And the sweet scented jessamine wav'd in the wind; Yet dearer to me than proud turret or dome Were the halls of my fathers, the old house at home! III But now the old house is no dwelling for me, The home of the stranger henceforth it shall be; And ne'er will I view it, nor rove as a guest, O'er the ever green fields which my father possessed; Yet still, in my slumbers, sweet visions will come Of the days that are pass'd, and the old house at home! LONG, LONG AGO. I Tell me the tales, that to me were so dear, Long, long ago, long, long ago: Sing me the songs I delighted to hear, Long, long ago, long ago. Now you are come, all my grief is removed, Let me forget that so long you have roved, Let me believe that you love as you loved, Long, long ago, long ago! II Do you remember the path where we met, Long, long ago, long, long ago? Ah! yes you told me you ne'er would forget, Long, long ago, long ago. Then to all others my smile you preferred, Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word, Still my heart treasures the praises I heard, Long, long ago, long ago! III Though, by your kindness, my fond hopes were raised, Long, long ago, long, long ago! You by more eloquent lips have been praised, Long, long ago, long ago. But, by long absence, your truth has been tried, Still to your accents I listen with pride, Blest as I was, when I sat by your side, Long, long ago, long ago! THE LOVER'S LAY. I Hark! 'tis the lover's lay, What doth the fond one say? Oh, full of youthful beauty Is the face on which he gazes, And passive is the small white hand That to his lip he raises. He says, “My life shall prove How fond, how pure, my love!” II Hark! 'tis the maiden's wail! What is her plaintive tale? Though young, her cheek is faded, And her long hair hangs neglected; Her hand is press'd upon her brow, Her dark eyes are dejected: She says, “One year has prov'd How lightly I was lov'd!” III Hark! 'tis her lover's voice. Hark! he can still rejoice! Where all are gay, the gayest, In bright array, he dances, And with the fairest lady there He hand-in-hand advances, And says—what once he said To that forsaken maid! LOVE IS THE THEME OF THE MINSTREL. I Love is the theme! Love is the theme of the minstrel, all over the earth. List to the light hearted Chanson of France, Trace the burthen of German romance. Hear the guitar in the sweet orange grove; Of what sings the Spaniard? Oh, is it not love?—yes, yes, love is the theme! Love is the theme of the minstrel, all over the earth. II Love is the theme! Love is the theme of the minstrel, all over the earth. List to the song in the camp of the brave, Hear the sailor the sport of the wave. In court, or in cottage, wherever you rove, Of what sings the minstrel? Oh, is not love?—yes, yes, love is the theme! Love is the theme of the minstrel, all over the earth. THE WEDDING AT ST. AGNES. I Ever may we hear the bells From Saint Agnes' cloistered cells; May her vot'ries murmur there Matin hymn and vesper prayer. II Ever may a blessing rest On Saint Agnes's holy fane; Never shall a weary guest Ask a blessing there in vain. III Holy father, aid we need, Holy father intercede! We are lovers pale with care, We are lovers in despair. IV Parents have refused consent, And they never will relent! But kind priest to thee we kneel, And our anguish thou wilt heal. V Disobedient daughter, no! 'Tis my task to bid thee go; Never yet were hopes like thine Blest at holy Agnes' shrine. VI Father, at thy feet we kneel, Father, we applaud thy zeal, But when frowning age is dead, Smiling youth at last may wed. VII When we dwell in yonder tow'rs, When the wide domain is ours, Wonder not if then you wait, Holy monk, outside the gate. VIII From the park we shall bestow Neither pheasant, buck, nor doe; Herbs for you are fit repast, Lords shall feast, and monks shall fast! IX I'm content with coarsest bread, But if you're resolved to wed, Wherefore seek another shrine? Let the holy task be mine. THE OLD BACHELOR. I When I was a school-boy, aged ten, Oh, mighty little Greek I knew; With my short strip'd trowsers, and now and then With stripes upon my jacket too! When I saw other boys to the play-ground run, I threw my old Gradus by, And I left the task I had scarce begun, There'll be time enough for that, said I. II When I was at college, my pride was dress, And my groom and my bit of blood; But as for my study, I must confess, That I was content with my stud. I was deep in my Tradesmen's books, I'm afraid, Tho' not in my own by the bye; And when rascally tailors came to be paid, There'll be time enough for that, said I. III I was just nineteen when I first fell in love, And I scribbled a deal of rhyme; And I talk'd to myself in a shady grove, And I thought I was quite sublime; I was torn from my love! 'twas a dreadful blow, And the lady she wip'd her eye; But I didn't die of grief, oh, dear me, no! There'll be time enough for that, said I. IV The next was a lady of rank, a dame With blood in her veins you see; With the leaves of the Peerage, she fann'd the flame That was now consuming me. But tho' of her great descent she spoke, I found she was still very high, And I thought looking up to a wife no joke, There'll be time enough for that, said I. V My next penchant was for one whose face Was her fortune, she was so fair! Oh, she spoke with an air of enchanting grace, But a man cannot live upon air; And when poverty enters the door, young love Will out of the casement fly; The truth of the proverb I'd no wish to prove, There'll be time enough for that, said I. VI My next was a lady who loved romance, And wrote very splendid things; And she said with a sneer, when I ask'd her to dance, “Sir, I ride upon a horse with wings.” There was ink on her thumb when I kissed her hand, And she whisper'd “If you should die, I will write you an epitaph, gloomy, and grand,” There'll be time enough for that, said I. VII I left her, and sported my figure and face, At opera, party, and ball; I met pretty girls at ev'ry place, But I found a defect in all! The first did not suit me, I cannot tell how, The second I cannot say why; And the third, bless me, I will not marry now, There'll be time enough for that, said I. VIII I look'd in the glass, and I thought I could trace A sort of a wrinkle or two; So I made up my mind, that I'd make up my face, And come out as good as new. To my hair I imparted a little more jet, And I scarce could suppress a sigh; But I cannot be quite an old Bachelor yet— No, there's time enough for that, said I. IX I was now fifty one, yet I still did adopt All the airs of a juvenile beau; But, somehow, whenever a question I popp'd, The girls with a laugh said “No!” I am sixty to-day, not a very young man, And a bachelor doom'd to die; So youths be advised, and marry while you can, There's no time to be lost, say I. OUT. I Out, John! out, John! what are you about John? If you don't say out at once, you make the fellow doubt, John! Say I'm out, whoever calls, and hide my hat and cane, John! Say you've not the least idea when I shall come again, John! Let the people leave their bills, but tell them not to call, John! Say I'm courting Miss Rupee, and mean to pay them all, John! Out, John! out, John! what are you about, John! If you don't say out at once, you make the fellow doubt, John! II Run, John, run, John! there's another dun, John! If it's Prodger, bid him call to-morrow week at one, John! If he says he saw me at the window, as he knock'd, John! Make a face, and shake your head, and tell him you are shock'd, John! Take your pocket handkerchief, and put it to your eye, John! Say your master's not the man to bid you tell a lie, John! Out, John! out, John! &amp;c. III Oh, John, go, John! there's Noodle's knock, I know, John! Tell him that all yesterday you sought him high and low, John! Tell him just before he came, you saw me mount the hill, John! Say you think I'm only gone to pay his little bill, John! Then I think you better add, that if I miss to-day, John! You're sure I mean to call when next I pass his way, John! Out, John! out, John! &amp;c. IV Hie, John, fly, John! I will tell you why, John! If there is not Grimshawe at the corner, let me die, John! He will hear of no excuse, I'm sure he'll search the house, John! Peeping into corners hardly fit to hold a mouse, John! Beg he'll take a chair and wait, I know he won't refuse, John! I'll pop thro' the little door that opens to the mews, John! Out, John! out, John! &amp;c. THE MAN THAT HAS BEEN YOUNGER. I 'Tis he! 'tis he! how well he wears, No change since last we met him, I think Old Time, with all his cares, Has managed to forget him; His age, but no! be that forgot, For dates we do not hunger, He merely is (and who is not), The man that has been younger. II His hair has ne'er betrayed a fall, It still is dark and curly. Be wise, if you wear wigs at all, Like him adopt one early. He still retains the jaunty air, His limbs look even stronger, And yet he is, we're all aware, The man that has been younger. III When first I met him in the park, With joy unfeign'd and real, I paused five minutes to remark The toilet's beau ideal. That's five and thirty years ago; Indeed it may be longer! And he's unchang'd, though well we know A man that has been younger. IV And still the glass is raised to scan The fairest nymph that passes, And still the figure of the man Attracts all other glasses. For female admiration, still, His spirit seems to hunger, And yet he is, do what he will, The man that has been younger. DON'T SING ENGLISH BALLADS. I I hate English ballads, don't sing them, I wish Cousin John wouldn't bring them, In the fire I beg you to fling them, And sing in a loftier key. I've bought you a new grand piano, Your voice is a charming soprano, Then don't sing such trumpery, ah, no, Don't sing English ballads to me! II “We met,” from your memory drive it, “The Soldier's Tear,” shall I survive it? Do wipe it away love, for private The tear of a private should be; What ditty is this you've your hand on? “Isle of Beauty!” that ballad abandon, It's an isle I have no wish to land on; Don't sing English ballads to me! III The English words seem so phlegmatic, Italian is aristocratic, I know that the sound is ecstatic, Whatever the meaning may be; I don't mean to say that I know it, As for learning, I'd not undergo it! If ignorant why should we show it; Don't sing English ballads to me! IV I've now got the music book ready, Do sit up and sing like a lady, A recitative from Tancredi, And something about “Palpiti,” Sing forte when first you begin it, Piano the very next minute, They'll cry “what expression there's in it;” Don't sing English ballads to me! THERE DWELT A LADY VERY YOUNG. I There dwelt a lady very young In a castle very old, One lover came with store of love, And one with store of gold; And both with bow and arrow shot, And both the mark could strike, And each could play his own guitar, And each could charm alike. Then which to choose and which refuse, The lady well might ask, Decision with such perfect men Was not an easy task. II At length, she said, “Come both with me, To-morrow I'll decide, And he who plays and shoots the best, Shall claim me as his bride.” The poor one had no trust except His oft exerted skill, The rich one was resolv'd to trust To something better still. “Henceforth, I'll play with golden strings, With gold I'll tip my dart; Yes, yes!” said he, “I know the way, To win the lady's heart.” III Oh, he was first to school, but see, His dart's no longer fleet, And he was first to play, But hark his harp's no longer sweet. The poor one's dart is tip'd with steel, His strings are simple wire, Guitar and dart have won her heart, What change can he desire? The lady's voice has nam'd her choice, And yonder knight is told: He wins who trusts to zeal and worth, He fails, who trusts to gold. GRENADIER. I Cries William, when just come from sea, “Does any one know my Annette? Oh, say, is she faithful to me, Alas, it is long since we met!” “Yes, yes,” an old gossip replies, “We all know her very well here, She has red lips and bonny black eyes; And she lives with her own Granny dear,” “Grenadier! did you say? did you say Grenadier?” “Yes, yes,” the old gossip replies, “She lives with her old Granny dear, O dear!” II Annette flew to welcome him home, But he turn'd from the maid with disdain: “False girl, I suppose you are come To jeer me, and laugh at my pain; Since scandal hath blotted your name, I deem you unworthy a tear, I've been told by an elderly dame, That you live with your own Grenadier.” “Grenadier! did you say Grenadier?” “Yes, I'm told by an elderly dame, That you live with your own Grenadier, O dear!” III Quoth pretty Annette, “Do you dare, To call me inconstant and frail? Beware, Master William, beware, How you trump up an old woman's tale! 'Tis true, when such stories are told, We should not believe half that we hear, Yet I own that my Granny is old, So I live with my own Granny dear.” “Granny dear! did you say? did you say Granny dear?” “Yes, I own that my Granny is old, So I live with my old Granny dear, my dear! MY DAUGHTER'S AN ACCOMPLISHED GIRL. I My daughter's an accomplished girl, (Now, Mary, that's absurd)— 'Tis thus she always runs away, From one applauding word, But since she thus has left us, Sir, I'll promise you a treat, And prove that such a gifted girl You'll very rarely meet! II Her drawings, Sir, all Poonah work, (The fashionable kind;) Her Poonah drawings! surely, Sir, That girl's a deal of mind! Excuse a partial mother, Sir, But think how she will please Her husband, should she ever wed, With Poonah works like these! III And look, Sir, here is her guitar, Dear me, it wants a string! You're fond of music, after tea, Prevail on her to sing. She has not got much voice you know, But take the nearest chair, And stoop your head, and you will then Distinctly hear the air! IV And here is all her worsted work, And pair of slippers, Sir! (I'm sure he'll be a happy man Who wins that gift from her!) She made that rug—now do observe How natural the cat! She work'd that screen—you must allow There's intellect in that! V And here's her album, bound in blue, With clasp, and lock, and key; Oh! such sweet lines about “How doth The little busy bee!” I see you're struck! in truth, she is A sweet accomplished girl! Go, woo her, Sir; unless she loves, She will not wed an Earl! EXPERIENCE, OR THE WAY OF THE WORLD. I Once the Sage Experience Whispered to me, “I will teach thee common sense; “Listen,” quoth he. So I put on a serious look, Tho' I laugh'd in my sleeve at his lecture book. And this is the way of the world. II “Covet not,” my mentor cried, “Any man's lot;” Most demurely, I replied, “Certainly not.” And so next day I went to law, With my neighbour about a stick or straw, And this is the way of the world. III “Chuse your friends for sterling worth; “Wit will not do.” “Oh!” I answer'd “nought on earth “Can be more true.” But worth was much too dull for me, So I chose my friend, for a repartee, And this is the way of the world. IV “Rather chuse a meal of herbs, “If Love's a guest, “Than eat of gold, if Hate disturbs “The splendid feast.” “Most true,” said I, “love sweetens life,” So for money I married a cross old wife, And this is the way of the world. V Soon Experience cried out, “Listen to me! “Words and deeds, beyond a doubt, “Ought to agree!” Said I, “Good words you are welcome to, “But my deeds are to please myself, not you,” And this is the way of the world. TEA AND TURN OUT.LADY. “The neighbours, oh! let me invite them, Dear husband we must give a ball; The neighbours will think that we slight them, Unless we send cards to them all.”GENTLEMAN. “The neighbours, pooh, fiddle-de-dee, What is all this turmoil about? Pray, why can't you ask them to tea, ma'am? There's nothing like tea and turn-out.”BOTH. “Yes, I will,/Yes, I must, have a ball, not a rout, To-morrow I'll send the cards out, A Ball but no tea and turn out There's nothing like tea and turn out.”LADY. “In what a strange light you must see things, To talk of a tea-party thus; How folks will look down on our tea things Who spread supper tables for us.”GENTLEMAN. “Get wafers, and negus, and ices, There's nought so genteel as a rout.” “Go cut up a pound cake in slices, They can't call that tea and turn out.”BOTH. We must have a ball, not a rout, &amp;c.LADY. “My dear, you are talking in riddles; You're late my procedings to stop, I've order'd the lights and the fiddles, And ask'd Captain Flute to my hop.” GENTLEMAN. “If you are in earnest, you must, ma'am, Pay dearly for what you're about, In my house if you raise a dust, ma'am, Pray leave T T L, and turn out!” BOTH. We must have a ball, not a rout, &amp;c. MY SON TOM. I My son's a youth of talents rare, You really ought to know him; But he blushes so, when people stare, That he seldom lets me show him. To school he never yet was sent, Nor yet to Oxford College; So all are in astonishment Where Tom pick'd up his knowledge. My Tom's a youth of talents rare, You really ought to know him, But he blushes so, when people stare, That he seldom lets me show him. II But Tom's a minor, recollect, But nineteen next November! And so, of course, one can't expect Big books he should remember; With clever boys, if people force Their minds, 'tis ruination; So I let nature take her course, A fig for education! My Tom's a youth of talents rare, &amp;c. III By instinct, Tom picks up at once The things that others study. My husband storms, and calls him dunce, He should not do so, should he? Some talk about the books they've read, And each is thought a wise one, Tom makes, all out of his own head, Remarks that quite surprise one. My Tom's a youth of talents rare, &amp;c. IV Tom wears no stock, no long-tail'd coat, Unfit for boys of his age. A jacket and an open throat Best suits his form and visage: Hereafter when the fair, and gay, My darling is pursuing, I'm sure he will not fail to say, “'Twas all my mother's doing!” My Tom's a youth of talents rare, &amp;c. MY DAUGHTER FAN. I My daughter Fan, oh, look at her face, You'll own she's quite uncommon; A girl in years, but in beauty and grace, My daughter Fan's a woman. And well indeed may her mother be proud When she makes such a great sensation, 'Tis nature all—she was never allow'd To be bother'd with education. II My daughter Fan has never been shown Her steps by a dancing master, But she skips about in a way of her own, And nobody gallops faster. She never was taught to sing a bit! And that's what makes me prouder; For when she sings, you'll all admit That nobody can sing louder. III My daughter Fan had her miniature done, I look'd upon that as a duty, Next year, no doubt, her face will be one Of the gems of the Book of Beauty. When Chantry sees her, I think he'll faint, So very superb her bust is, But, after all, neither chisel nor paint Can do my daughter justice. IV The eyes of my daughter seem to me Divine, as I've often told her, While one looks straight, the other, you see, Seems peeping over her shoulder! And that, with her nose (in the turn-up style), I give you my word and honour, Has such a charm, that it wins a smile From all who look upon her! V My daughter Fan will come out in the spring, She begs—and I can't refuse her! But oh dear me 'tis a terrible thing, To think that I soon must lose her! For when she's out she'll marry 'tis clear, And that my bosom touches; My daughter Fan, this time next year, Is sure to be a duchess! THO' FIFTY, I AM STILL A BEAU! I Tho' fifty, I am still a beau, My face is smooth and fair; No dandy in his teens can show A finer head of hair. My wig suspicion has defied, I take observers in, For when the curls are comb'd aside, You'd swear you saw the skin! II My sight may fail, but you will ne'er Behold a beau in specs; We've double glasses, which we wear Suspended round our necks; Those spectacles proclaim decay, And make one look four score, But double glasses seem to say, “Near sighted—nothing more.” III To modern vocalists, alone, I give my word of praise, But never own to having known The stars of other days. Though Mara sang delightfully When I was in my prime; When she is named I say “Dear me! She was before my time.” IV My nephews say, (I'm well aware) That I shall never wed, They hope his worldly goods to share, When Uncle John is dead. But ladies smile on Uncle John, He knows what he's about, And when he weds, his eldest son Will cut his cousins out. V For some sweet girl I daily seek, Not more than twenty-one; A perfect figure, and a cheek Like roses in the sun; Good fortune and good family, Good temper too I want; When all these charms combined I see, Then, nephews, hail your aunt! DRESS'D FOR THE LEVEE! I Dress'd for the levee! come, mother, and see! I must put on my sword,—stop! which side should it be? I'll look at the mirror once more if you please; I wonder they make us wear dresses like these! Is it becoming?—delighted at that! But why in the world must I wear a cock'd hat? II Sister Maria does nothing but laugh, She says that my legs havn't got any calf! And then her maid presuming to say, “La! Master's dress'd up like a man in the play!” Is it becoming? Indeed, I'm so glad! I don't think my legs are by any means bad! III Oh! how I envy the men who can sport Some sort of a uniform going to Court! There is my uncle! we do look, my dear, Rather like Noodle and Doodle I fear. Is it becoming? well you should know best, The bag's rather funny, it must be confest. IV What must I say to the King, Uncle John? Bow and kiss hands, and then merely pass on. It's well that you told me my speech would have been, “Fine weather your Majesty; how is the Queen?” Is it becoming? I'm glad if it is, But I fear, after all, I look rather a quiz! THE ROSE THAT ALL ARE PRAISING. I The rose that all are praising Is not the rose for me; Too many eyes are gazing Upon the costly tree. But there's a rose in yonder glen, That shuns the gaze of other men, For me its blossom raising; Oh, that's the rose for me! II The gem a King might covet Is not the gem for me; From darkness they would move it, Save that the world may see. But I've a gem that shuns display, And next my heart worn ev'ry day, So dearly do I love it; Oh, that's the gem for me! III Gay birds in cages pining Are not the birds for me; Those plumes so brightly shining Would fain fly off from thee: But I've a bird that gaily sings, Tho' free to rove, she folds her wings, For me her flight resigning; Oh, that's the bird for me! I KNOW HE DOTH NOT LOVE ME. I I know he doth not love me, as I was lov'd at first, I cannot tell the reason, I'd ask him if I durst, But that might drive him from me, and tho' it breaks my heart To see him frown upon me, 'twere worse, far worse to part. II Perhaps he knows my sadness, yet should he not reflect I never knew a sorrow 'till chill'd by his neglect; And still with smiles I'd meet him, if I could only see The glance of fond affection that used to beam on me. BEFORE THE BALL. I I'm delighted, I've invited All my neighbours to the ball; How diverting! oh, I'm certain That the house won't hold 'em all! Go, and take the carpets up, Wash the rooms, they won't be dry. In my bed-room we must sup, Take the bed down, by the bye. I must sleep out at the inn; Mind you send my sac de nuit. Hang the lamps up, pray begin; Who'll have time to make the tea? Send for Sophy, tea and coffee Must be handed round to all; How it's blowing! how it's snowing! What a night to give a ball! II Is my dress got? oh, Miss Prescott! Just in time, I do declare! “Eight o'clock, ma'am.” “There's a knock, ma'am.” Oh! the man to do my hair. What are all these little notes? All excuses—oh dear me! All the Seymores got sore throats! Lady Sykes, and Lord Nugee! All my tiptop folks unwell, E'en a saint it would provoke; What a smother! what a smell! Colour'd lamps are sure to smoke. More excuses! what the deuce is Come to people? poorly all! How it's blowing! how it's snowing! What a night to give a ball! III There's a lady come already! Not a thing is comme il faut; See the waiters in their gaiters, Oh! it won't go right, I know. Mrs. Stubbs! well, let her wait; Go and say I'm quite concern'd. A'nt the music very late? Oh, I hope 'tant overturn'd! Hark—a knock! they'll think I'm lost, There's the music come at last, What a ball! the Morning Post Shall describe it when it's past. Oh, how pleasing! what a squeezing! See them thronging, great and small. How it's blowing! how it's snowing! What a night to give a ball! AFTER THE BALL. I Come, let us talk the evening over, I'm sure I'm glad we're under cover, The wind so high, the night so dark, I wish my guests well thro' the park; But vastly snug ourselves we'll render, We'll put our feet upon the fender, And o'er a cosey cup of tea, We'll chat, for none can hear or see, About the ball and the company. II All said my ball was to their liking, The tout ensemble grand and striking; The paper roses sweetly plac'd, The colour'd lamps arrang'd with taste; And tho' I own it was provoking, To see the lamps persist in smoking, Yet many people said to me, They liked the smoke exceedingly— It did not annoy the company. III At supper time, 'twas unexampled, How people o'er their neighbours trampled, Afraid of being left behind— I half suspect they had not dined! I bade Lord John take Lady Susan, And lead the way; at least a dozen Already had unask'd made free! I really thought there would not be Food enough for the company. IV Then, one by one, the good things vanish'd, The table was again replenish'd, And still they cut and came again, And naught but drumsticks now remain. I thought the men would drink for ever! I made the fiddlers thrice endeavour To lure the truants back to me; For 'twas a dreary sight to see The female part of the company. V But now, my dear, I see you're dozing, I scarce can keep my eyes from closing; We've kept it up, as people say, Till Phœbus ushered in the day. Oh dear! oh dear! I think with sorrow The state the house will be in to-morrow; No comfort here for you or me; Oh! my dear, I dread to see The ghost of the ball and the company. POEMS AND SONGS. LOVE AND A COTTAGE. Once on a time (no matter when or where) There liv'd in Britain's Isle a youthful pair; In boyish days no pleasure Edward knew, Unless the sport was shared by Ellen too; Her chosen games he always would prefer, And learnt those lessons best—he learnt with her; Fair Ellen, too, her early playmate loved, And often wore the sash that he approved,— Pursued her evening walk with feigned alarm, To gain the fond protection of his arm; His gifts and tokens she preserved with care, And wore a ring composed of Edward's hair. But girls will grow, and as their years increase, The world decrees these gay delights should cease. Ellen was just eighteen: that happy time, When youth's gay spirit revels in its prime; When love's first tremor to the bosom steals, And woman wonders at the glow she feels; In form and manners changed, she now appears In all the loveliness of riper years; And Edward, too, was changed, for he began To be not quite a boy, nor quite a man; But, from his looks and manners you might deem He was not boyish in his own esteem. His neckcloth now in graceful folds was placed, And gave a sample of the wearer's taste: And, every inch a beau, he stoutly said That none henceforth should call him Master Ned. But, though the charms of bats and balls were fled, And other sports engross'd him in their stead; Though taw and tennis not a thought could claim, And nobler billiards was his only game; Though gay and unconfined he loved to range For new delights;—his heart had known no change; And though transformed with fashionable skill, His youth's companion was remembered still. Returned from school, with wonder and delight He saw the change in Ellen's form and height; And scarcely could he believe the blooming belle Was she whose hoyden tricks he loved so well. They were at first reserved, and knew not how To get beyond a curtsey and a bow: Each suffered a restraint unfelt before. Little was said—but then they thought the more; And soon their tell-tale eyes revealed to each Much more than could be told by parts of speech: Their silence quickly ceased—reserve was lost. And both seemed striving which could talk the most. Daily they met—and failed not to produce, For meetings yet to come, some new excuse; They both found out that early rising serves To give elastic vigour to the nerves; Discovered next the needful good that lies In morning air and constant exercise. And Ellen often ventured out, by stealth, To walk with Edward, and improve her health; And then, whatever walk she chose to name, He always chanced to fix upon the same; And morning, noon, or night, where'er they went, The couple always met—by accident. A sudden love of reading offered next For frequent interviews a good pretext; But Edward's eye oft wandered from his books, To read expressive things in Ellen's looks; And long she listened—for the voice she heard Imparted melody to every word: Reading has charms—and they perceived the charm Was much increased by reading arm in arm; And found their scientific walk so sweet, The more they met, the more they wish'd to meet. Their love of learning none could disapprove, Until, by some mischance, they learnt to love! Then mothers went into fits, and fathers swore, And all declared that they should meet no more; Said days of joy would end in years of pain, And talk'd of prudent schemes—but talk'd in vain: They argued well that Cupid is averse To scanty larders, and an empty purse; That wedded paupers often mourn their lot, And find affection will not boil the pot; And said (whatever boys and girls may think) Lovers, though vastly warm, must eat and drink. But all their arguments had little force, For Edward only thought them words of course. “Shall we,” he said, “who love as much—or more Than ever two young people loved before, Shall we be pent in lucre's paltry bounds, And part because our shillings are not pounds? Shall I look out for wealth, and strive to catch Some advantageous mercenary match? No! to my charming Ellen still I turn: Love's rosy links are easy to be borne; Let sordid souls repent, and mourn in vain The heavy splendour of their golden chain.” “Although we boast no riches,” Ellen cried, “What can I want with Edward at my side? Without wax lights our cot shall ne'er be dim, For even tallow must burn bright with him: Love and a Cottage is the lot I prize, And lucre, filthy lucre, I despise.” The day was fix'd, and Edward flew to buy A charming cottage just two stories high; And one was found which, though extremely small, Was large enough to hold their little all. Some months the bride, with fortitude unshaken, Endured the dull routine of beans and bacon; Preserved each precious morsel on the shelf, And eat the puddings that she made herself; By daily repetition well she knew How to provide but just enough for two; Learnt to economise in every way, And hash the mutton of a former day. Before her spouse she laboured to conceal Her secret horror of the vulgar meal; Boldly contended with domestic ills, And studied the amount of baker's bills. Her bridal garments soil'd, with wondrous skill, She turn'd, and wash'd, and made them useful still; Corrected and revised her old array, And neatly darn'd each symptom of decay; Contrived to make the last year's bonnet do, And said it look'd almost as good as new; Dyed her old gown, its splendour to recall; And sigh'd in secret—if she sigh'd at all. The bridegroom gazed upon his lovely wife, Talk'd of domestic joys, and rural life; Genteelly acquiesced in all she said, And drank her currant wine both white and red. So far 'twas well—but ere two years were past, Their matrimonial sky was overcast; And Ellen then, in tone not very sweet, Complain'd their mansion was not quite complete. “'Tis such a bore,” said she, “in rainy weather, In this small room to sit all day together, Which serves for drawing-room and parlour too: And there's no study set apart for you; You're never out of hearing—and it feels So strange to have you always at my heels; We're very loving—but it is too much To sit so close—our elbows almost touch. And then our maid (alas! we have but one) Does only half of all that should be done, For Nelly acts as cook and butler both, And she who scrubs the kitchen lays the cloth; With arms all crimson, and a flaming face, She bustles on, sole handmaid of the place; And frequent must my occupations be, Since all she fails to do—is done by me: Oft am I plagued with closet, drawer and shelf— In fact, I'm maid of all work to myself. My dear, before I married you, I vow I wish I'd been as wise as I am now.” These Edward heard, and he at times gave vent To equal murmurings and discontent. “What you assert, my love,” he cried, “is true, I think our cottage quite as small as you; But then, my charmer, what can you expect, Your portion brought me nothing, recollect; ‘Nothing can come of nothing,’ pounds and pence In calculations make a difference, I hate our paltry dinners, where the meat Is only just as much as we can eat; If sick of mutton roasted, we arrange To have it boil'd next day, by way of change; And boil'd or roasted, it might do, I own, Had I some good old port to wash it down; But as for currant wine, say what you will, That home-made stuff is apt to make one ill. In tedious tête-à-tête our time is past— Each day a repetition of the last; And in this nutshell, as we sit alone, I hear no human voice except your own. We used to read—but who can pass his life In reading doleful ditties to his wife?” This was his constant theme: thus months were spent In bitter matrimonial argument. “Love and a Cottage” was their former boast— The Cottage still remains, but Love is lost; And when for man and wife it proved too small, No wonder Love could find no room at all. Thus wise at length—though haply wise too late, By mutual consent they separate: And by a written paper we are told— “This Cottage either to be let or sold.” NIGHT THOUGHTS. I When mortals repose on the pillow of night, When nought except fancy's dominion is bright, When the day-dreams of man for a moment are crush'd, And the wailings of childhood in slumbers are hush'd, Through the maze of the past our steps we retread, And the form of the future before us is spread; All the sorrows and fears of the present are flown, And the fancy exists in a world of its own. II Then the forms of the absent distinctly appear, And the voice of affection seems whispering near; All painful realities fade from the view, While friends seem all constant, and lovers all true. Though the eye-lid is closed, with precision we trace Each well beloved feature, each good humour'd face; Though silence surrounds us, their accents remain, And in vision they speak, and we listen again. III Though the sun-shine of Hope and of Fortune may set, In slumbers and dreams it may visit us yet; Though our moments of pleasure so soon pass away, We retrace in the night all the joys of the day; Our mirth would be short if we could not prolong The fond recollection of dance and of song; And our youthful adventures would vanish too fast, If we could not dream over the bliss of the past. BE SILENT, MY LUTE! I Be silent, for ever, be silent, my lute! For the voice that has echoed your numbers is mute; The spirit, the life of my music is o'er, For the ear that has listen'd can listen no more: There has been a time, when my eye has survey'd The theme and the song of my soul as I play'd,— But her features are clouded, her accents are mute, Then be silent, for ever, be silent, my lute! II The garden she planted its blossoms may boast, But the flower is faded which gladden'd it most; Her bowers may bloom with clematis and vine, But where is the hand that once taught them to twine? Thus, the landscape at midnight is beautiful still, And freshness remains upon valley and hill; But then the eye rests upon darkness alone, For the beams that illumine each object are gone. III 'Tis long since we parted, I seek thee in vain; My Ellen! I never can meet thee again! Yet still there are ties which time cannot remove, When we mourn o'er the relics of those that we love: Like rocks which the whirlwind asunder has thrown, Though sever'd for ever in years that are gone, Though the flood of the valley flows darkly between, The trace of their union on each may be seen. IV There once was a time when my muse could assuage The blots and the sorrows that darken life's page; But now every verse unavailing must prove, For tears damp the strings of the lyre of love. Yet still I can look on the lute that she loved, And hear from another the song she approved; But the words and the notes cannot charm me alone, For the spirit, the life, of my music is gone. V Oh! tell me no more of the hopes that you see, For a cloud hovers still 'twixt their radiance and me; I trusted them once—but they left me to mourn; I may view them in thought—but they cannot return. To a sailor whose bark on the billows is tost, When tempests o'erwhelm him, and succour is lost, 'Tis cruel to point to the meadows and groves, And the roses that bloom round the home that he loves. OH, DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT MY HOURS ARE GAY! I Oh! do not suppose that my hours Are always unclouded and gay; Or that thorns never mix with the flowers That fortune has strew'd in my way: When seen by the cold and unfeeling, We smile through the sorrows we feel; But smiles are deceitful—concealing The wounds which they never can heal. II The world is a changeable ocean, And sunbeams and shadows abound; Where the surface seems least in commotion, The rocks of misfortune are found:— And man is the pilot, who steering, Of every billow the sport, Sees the gale of prosperity veering, Which promised to waft him to port. III Our hopes are the gales that serenely Waft onward our sails as we float; Our tears are the whirlwinds that keenly O'erwhelm our poor perishing boat; And reason's the beacon that gives us It's light through life's perilous way, But folly's the ray that deceives us, And leads us too often astray. IV Our moments of mirth may be many, And hope half our sorrow beguiles; But, believe me, there cannot be any Whose features are always in smiles. The heart may be sad and repining, Though cheerfulness brightens the scene, As a goblet with gems may be shining, Though bitter the potion within. V A glittering volume may cover A story of sorrow and woe; And night's gayest meteors may hover Where dangers lie lurking below; Thus oft, in the sunshine of gladness, The cheek and the eye may be drest, Whilst the clouds of dejection and sadness In secret o'ershadow the breast. YOU TELL ME THAT MY SMILES ARE LOST. I You tell me I no longer boast The sprightly language once my own; That all my former smiles are lost, And all my cheerful spirits flown. II You say my songs, in former days, Were fraught with love and hope united; But now the subjects of my lays Are, hope deceived, and passion slighted. III It may be so—for fleeting years The spell from boyhood's dream will sever; And in a world of smiles and tears No song of joy can last for ever. IV And when I sung of love and hope, They were the visions of a boy: Then fancy gives us ample scope For forming plans of future joy. V But riper years too often blight The opening buds that youth had nourish'd; Some cold neglect, some cruel slight, May wound the heart where friendship flourish'd. VI When those we long have loved deceive, We view our loss with vain regret; Our feelings prompt us to forgive, Our wound forbids us to forget. VII And then, though each may meet again, Though no reproving word be spoken, Yet every effort will be vain To join the links by folly broken. VIII But sudden wrath cannot remove The memory of former ties; And though deceit must weaken love, It feels acutely ere it dies. THE HEROES OF WATERLOO. I Weep for the heroes who nobly have perish'd, Whilst planting the olive of freedom on earth; Long shall their names, by their countrymen cherish'd, Ennoble the island that gave them their birth. History, painting their triumph in story, Checks for awhile her victorious strain, And pensively turns to encircle in glory The heroes who fell upon Waterloo's plain. II Yet mourn not for them! for in future tradition Their fame shall exist as our tutelar star; To instil, by example, the noble ambition Of falling, like them, in a glorious war. Posterity long shall remember with pleasure They perish'd for freedom, nor perish'd in vain; And minstrels shall choose for their favourite measure The tale of the battle on Waterloo's plain. III Surviving affection must ever lament them, Mothers and wives for their treasures must mourn; Had they but lived, oh! how sweet to present them The wreaths that must now deck their funeral urn. Though tears may be seen in the bright eye of beauty, One consolation must ever remain— Undaunted they trod in the pathway of duty, Which led them to glory on Waterloo's plain. HINTS TO LOVERS. I How oft by mankind is it spoken That love is the source of all ill; That many fond hearts he has broken, And blights all our happiness still. But I cannot tell how they contrive it, Though lovers complain of their lot, They commonly seem to survive it, If hearts have been broken or not. II Though there's always a portion of sighing, You'll find no disease in a sigh; And until men and women love dying, Love never will cause them to die. If men would get rid of their anguish, I'll cure their disquietude thus— Let us all resolve never to languish For girls that won't languish for us. III No hard-hearted beauty can move me, Who answers my smiles with a frown; But if one should e'er deign to love me, That instant my heart is her own. Through Cupid's wild labyrinth roving, Who is there that never has proved, Though there's something delightful in loving, There's heaven in being beloved? IV When love is o'erwhelm'd with distresses, They flow from our folly alone; But all of the joys he possesses Are tender delights of his own. When vainly our vows have been plighted, No more protestations we'll waste; But slighting—as we have been slighted, We'll leave them, and pity their taste. V When two hearts are govern'd by Cupid, All sorrowful feelings are flown, But truly that love must be stupid, Which only is cherish'd by one. All those who are sad and forsaken From former disasters may learn, Ere they love, proper care should be taken That somebody loves in return. ELLEN. I “Farewell!” exclaim'd Ellen, with furious spite— “From your presence with joy I'll remove; Your detestable name I will never unite With the visions of friendship and love.” “Pretty Ellen,” I cried, “where's the use of this fuss? Do endeavour your anger to stifle; Separation possesses no terrors for us, And appears to my mind a mere trifle. II “You accuse me of falsehood, and call me unkind,— But my errors may sure be forgiven; I call you an angel,—and, therefore, you find I am loth to detain you from heaven. Since first I beheld you, I'm sure you must know That to please you has been my endeavour; And now that you say, 'tis your pleasure to go, I'm more anxious to please you than ever.” LINES ON READING MOORE'S FAREWELL TO HIS HARP, IN THE SIXTH NUMBER OF THE IRISH MELODIES. I Heed not the poet's parting words, Nor think you hear his closing strain; For love still lingers on the chords, And wooes him to his lyre again. II His hand its office may refuse, But genius cannot slumber long; And soon again shall Erin's muse Give life and strength to Erin's song. III Again his music shall bestow A charm to make our moments gay; Again the lover's heart shall glow, While beauty's lip repeats the lay. IV Yes, often shall his voice receive The patriot's praise, the fair one's smile; And Albion's sons again shall give The tribute of a sister isle. V Then do not hear him with regret, Or at his farewell notes repine; Our favourite bard shall charm us yet With many a gay and sportive line. VI When lovers breathe a last adieu To maids who treat them with disdain; A glance their passion can renew, A smile can lure them back again. VII Thus though the bard may now rebel, Though now his hand the lyre may spurn; The echoes of his own farewell Shall tempt the rover to return. “THREE WORDS” TO A LADY FROM WHOM THE AUTHOR HAD RECEIVED A PURSE OF THREE COLOURS. I. Three days you labour'd to unite Three colours, beautiful and bright; Three times you raised my hopes, and said For me the triple web was made; Three times it seem'd before you gave it, 'Twas three to one I ne'er should have it; Three doubts, three fears, were quickly past; Thrice welcome came the purse at last. II. Three thanks I give, which can't reveal One third of what I ought to feel: Yet wanting some more strong device, In three short words, “I thank you,” thrice. I own I'm at (in lines like these) Sixes and sevens, more than threes; And you may think their folly such, Three of them would be three too much; Yet credit this, my joy shall be To drink your health in—three times three. SONGS OF THE DAYS OF CHIVALRY. THE KNIGHT WITH THE AZURE PLUME. I Where is the knight with the azure plume, With his eye of light, and his cheek of bloom; Whose arm seem'd made for the martial lance, Yet whose foot was fam'd for the joyous dance? A maiden sighs for that gay young knight: Say, how he far'd in the distant fight. II Brave was the knight with the azure plume, Though he lov'd the jess'mine bower's perfume, Though he shunn'd the hunter's wild pursuit, To list to the lay of a lady's lute; Though the sports of peace were his heart's delight, Laurels he won in the distant fight. III Where is the knight with the azure plume? A maiden weeps o'er his trophied tomb. That tomb she has raised with mournful care, But the form of her lover is not there! Cold on the plain lies the noble Knight, In the arms he wore in the distant fight. MY FATHER'S SWORD. I My father's sword upon the wall Has slumber'd since his death; Oh, give it me, for now 'tis time To throw away the sheath. Too long I've been content to wear The laurels that he won; Give me the sword—and it shall gain New laurels for his son! II My father's sword! Oh, blame me not, Though tears bedew the steel; Though nerveless now may fall my arm, It is not fear I feel. I weep to think how oft his hand Hath laid aside that sword, While he hath stoop'd to kiss my brow, And breathe some gentle word. III My father's sword!—this silken knot My own dear mother wove. Take hence the weapon—let it grace The halls she used to love. Give me another,—if my prayer In after years be heard— It shall not be unfit to hang Beside my father's sword. A LIGHT FROM HER CASEMENT BEAMS. I A light from her casement beams, 'Tis the only light in the tower! What keeps her still from the land of dreams? 'Tis past the midnight hour. To that lamp I am meant to steer, 'Tis a lure that love hath taught her; And now she is leaning forth to hear My oars dip in the water! II I come, sweet maid, I come! You shall have no cause to doubt me, For now it is plain, in your princely home, You are not quite blest without me. Can so poor a youth be dear To so proud a baron's daughter? Then hence with me, and none shall hear Our oars dip in the water! HE WILL BE THERE! I He will be there! On his white Arab steed, in his bright suit of mail, He will poise the good lance, never yet known to fail. He will be there! Oh, the gauntlet he'll seize that the proudest throw down, And on conquerors conquer'd he'll raise his renown. He will be there! II I will be there! The gem that I gave on his helmet will shine, And the name that he breathes in the fight will be mine. I will be there! A thousand bright eyes my love's triumph will see, My love 'mid ten thousand would single out me. I will be there! LOOK!—DO YOU SEE NO HORSEMAN THERE? I Look!—do you see no horseman there? Hark!—do you hear no drum? Look out, look out—I'll not despair— Come—oh my own love—come! Look from the battlement, look again, Some straggler soon you'll see: You're weary with the search, 'tis plain, Resign the task to me! Look!—do you see no horseman there? Hark!—do you hear no drum? Look out, look out—I'll not despair— Come, oh my own love, come! II Why do you weep? I shed no tear, What tho' so long we wait, Oh! do not breathe a sound of fear To greet him at the gate. I know you think he'll not return, Dare not to speak your dread! Or when he comes, my lord will learn That his poor bride is dead. Look!—do you see no horseman there? Hark!—do you hear no drum? Look out, look out—I'll not despair— Come, oh my own love, come! OH! DARK-EYED MAID OF PALESTINE. I Oh, dark-eyed maid of Palestine, Though thou hast set me free, Mistake me not—I cannot breathe Affection's vow to thee! The love that I can never feel My lip would scorn to feign, Then summon forth thy father's guard, And give me back my chain. II Far in a land thou ne'er wilt view, I left a gentle bride; I know that in my plighted vow Her fond heart will confide; She may be told that far away Her captive love was slain, She shall not hear that I was false, Then give me back my chain. III I see a tear steal o'er thy cheek— My sentence I await; But now thy trembling finger points To yonder open gate! Dark maid of Palestine, I seek My plighted bride again, And when we cease to pray for thee, Oh! give me my chain again. AH! WHO CAN SAY? I Throw down the lute and seize the lance, This is no time for song and dance; Go quench the festive lamps again; And check the bard's too joyous strain! At dawn of day they'll ride away— When to return—ah! who can say? II How full of change, and full of strife Must be the warrior's roving life! But danger gives his heart relief— He hath no time to nourish grief. At dawn of day, they'll ride away— When to return—ah! who can say? III But woman has a dreary fate— He goes—she lingers at the gate— And where he left her, lives to miss All that once made that life seem bliss! At dawn of day they'll ride away— When to return—ah! who can say? THE WREATH. WHAT CAN BE THY GRIEF, MY CHILD? I Come, my child! a crowd rejoices, To the casement quickly come. Hark! that shout of many voices, 'Tis the victor's welcome home! Age forsakes the blazing hearth, Youth exulting hurries forth, Eager to be first to say: “See, the warriors on their way!” Hail thy brother; turn and see Yon bright multitude with me. Silent still, with eyes so wild! What can be thy grief, my child? II Oh, look forth! the hill ascending, Now they quit the leafy glen; And the trumpet's note is blending With the tramp of armed men! I can see thy brother lead Some lamented comrade's steed. Start not, child! I say again That thy brother is not slain! Think how deep had been our gloom, Had he shared that comrade's doom— Silent still! with eyes so wild— Oh! I guess thy grief, my child! ROSE OF AILEEN. I It is not long since last we met, and you are still the same, Yet, oh! I saw you knew me not, until I told my name; You mourn the change, and well you know how deep my grief has been, For you were with me when I won the love of Rose Aileen. II I grieve to think my looks betray the anguish of my heart, In death I'd proudly still deny that I had felt the dart: Assuming smiles, amid the gay I fain would still be seen, I would not have the world believe I sigh for Rose Aileen. III Yet do not heed my selfish boast, a motive far more pure Would make me struggle to conceal the anguish I endure; I'd rather mourn in solitude, unpitied and unseen, Than that my gloom should seem to chide the smiles of Rose Aileen. THE TIDE IS EBBING FAST, MY CHILD. I “The tide is ebbing fast, my child, Come hither to the shore, And where the waves recede, we'll keep Our weary watch once more. They say thy father's boat was wreck'd— Nay, child, look not so pale, As yet no fragments on the sand Confirm the dreadful tale. II “I dare not move those dark sea weeds, To see what lies beneath; At ev'ry step I dread to meet Some harbinger of death. But cheer thee, child—the storm abates! We have no cause to mourn, For with the morning's flowing tide, Thy father will return.” III The night is gone,—and calmly comes The ripple of the tide. The fisher's wife is there—her child Stands weeping at her side. “Behold!” the mother cries, “a form Is floating on the wave! 'Tis he! droop not, for 'tis our task To bear him to his grave.” THE SELF-DEVOTED NUN. I When I hear the vesper bell, And the sisters bend the knee, Breathing prayers for all the world, In my heart I pray for thee. Yes—for thee alone I pray; But the novice they would blame, Did they know that in her cell She had dared to breathe thy name. II I have spurned thy proffer'd love, And thy presence still I shun; I am blameless—what art thou To the self-devoted nun! Oh! it is thy boast to dwell With the gay—the false—the free— And 'tis therefore on my knee That I still must pray for thee. III We shall meet no more on earth, Thou wilt think of me no more; But I'll pray that we may meet When this transient life is o'er. When this world has lost its charm, May it sooth thy soul's despair, To remember that thy name Has been hallow'd by my prayer. TELL ME NOT OF HOARDED GOLD. I Tell me not of hoarded gold From rich Peru; Rather let me first be told That thou art true; Tell me not of honours won, For I shall fear, One so honour'd soon will shun My humbler sphere. II Tell me not of happy Isles Where thou hast been; Tell me not of lovely smiles That thou hast seen: For I fear again thoul't seek A foreign shore; And the smile on Ellen's cheek Will charm no more. WITHER AWAY. I Wither away, green leaves, Wither away, sweet flowers! For me in vain young Spring has thrown Her mantle o'er the bowers. Sing not to me, gay birds, Borne in bright plumage hither; The heart recoils from pleasure's voice When all its fond hopes wither! Wither away! Wither away! II Wither away, my friends, Whom I have loved sincerely: 'Tis hard to sigh for the silent tomb, As a place of rest, so early! While others prize the rose, The cypress wreath I'll gather; The heart recoils from pleasure's voice, When all its fond hopes wither! Wither away! Wither away! OH! REST MY DUENNA. I “Oh, rest, my Duenna, thou'rt weary I see; Oh, rest, for 'tis my turn to watch over thee! We've wander'd too long in the heat of the sun, But now it is night, and thy labour is done; Thy cushions I'll place, and thy casement I'll close, And the voice of Sybella shall soothe thy repose. Oh rest, my Duenna, 'tis time to sleep, If you fear danger, strict watch I will keep!” II The cushions were soft, and the casement was closed, The lady Duenna soon nodded and dozed; Sybella, still singing her lullaby strain, Ran from her, and open'd the casement again. The slumberer moved when she felt the night air, In terror Sybella flew back to her chair: “Oh, rest, my Duenna, 'tis time to sleep, “If you fear danger, strict watch I will keep!” III She saw that she slept, and she stole from her side— She heard a low signal, and softly replied; Her lover appeared, and with treacherous care, The sleeping Duenna they tied to her chair. She woke in dismay, but she struggled in vain; They laughingly varied the lullaby strain: “Oh, wake my Duenna, 'tis wrong to sleep, “For if you fear danger, strict watch you should keep!” THE SONG OF GULNARE. I Far from my own land, the land of my fathers, The ship of the stranger now bears me away; Darkly around me the ocean mist gathers, I hear not a sound, save the dash of the spray. Now, near me, night-watch the forecastle paces, Striving to banish the exile's despair, He praises the Isles that we seek, but all places Are cheerless without the sweet song of Gulnare. II Oh! my own country, thy fruits and thy flowers Would fade 'neath the islander's temperate sky, Let me return to the orange-tree bowers, And there with my own love contented I'll die. They say that they lead me where woman possesses A soft eye of azure, and light golden hair; But give me the land of the long ebon tresses, The glance of dark lustre, the song of Gulnare. OH! REMEMBER THOSE SWEET HOURS. I Oh! remember those sweet hours Pass'd amid Italia's bowers, Or on Como's tranquil waters, Singing with her dark-eyed daughters. Oh! forget not the melodies stealing From the shore full of sweetness and feeling! Those indeed were happy times, When we rov'd in southern climes. II Oh! remember the rich lustre Of the ripe grape's purple cluster, And the dance and song of pleasure, When they cull'd the vintage treasure. Oh! forget not the melodies stealing From the shore full of sweetness and feeling! Those indeed were happy times When we rov'd in southern climes! MY OWN CHILD, MY DEAR CHILD. I My own child, my dear child, oh, smile on me again! And let me have one cheerful word; alas! I ask in vain: As well might I expect new bloom from blossoms I have crush'd; Or listen for the nightingale, whose melody I've hush'd: My own child, my dear child, forgive me ere we part, That look of anguish seems to say, “My mother broke my heart!” II My own child, my dear child, your early love was poor, And poverty hath many griefs, that you could ill endure; Too oft you met in former days, I feel my error now, But never think you were to blame, to break so rash a vow. My own child, my dear child, forgive me ere we part, That look of anguish seems to say, “My mother broke my heart!” III My own child, my dear child, a noble bride you'll be, The lover of your early days is gone far o'er the sea: He doubtless long hath ceas'd to prize the love of youthful years; Nay, do not weep, I meant my words to check these fruitless tears. My own child, my dear child, forgive me, ere we part, That look of anguish seems to say, “My mother broke my heart!” ROUGH SKETCHES OF BATH. Whilst Laureate Southey dedicates his lays To males and females born in other days; Whilst Byron writes, and leaves the world to guess Whether he's more than mortal man—or less; Whilst gentle Moore in love's own language speaks The charms of smiling eyes and dimpled cheeks; And nameless scribblers labour to instil A goose's wisdom with a goose's quill: I seize my pen, determined to rehearse The sports of Bladud in heroic verse; To sing of those who walk in fashion's path, And thus immortalize the charms of Bath! Spread your light wings, my Muse, and never heed The rules of those who write or those who read; Shall Genius be confined, or shall my rhyme Be circumscribed within the bounds of time? Can earthly bounds poetic heroes bind, Or paltry space enclose “the chainless mind?” No! modern poets think it no disgrace To spurn the unities of time and place; 'Tis fit they should the laws of time contemn, For future times will never hear of them. Sweet Bath! the liveliest city of the land, Where health and pleasure ramble hand in hand, Where smiling belles their earliest visit pay, And faded maids their lingering blooms delay; Delightful scenes of elegance and ease, Realms of the gay, where every sport can please! How often have I loitered through the street, Where Bond Street loungers at each step you meet; How often have I paused on all the joys, Boys who ape manhood, men transformed to boys; The never failing pump, the busy scene, Where doting sixty copies gay sixteen: The crowded room with seats beneath the clock, Where talking dames and politicians flock. I check my Pegasus—and post-chaise too, And pause, of Bath to take a distant view; And first—the Abbey Church its splendour rears, The sacred monument of former years; Behold its sculpture—and mark, whilst you view it, The pretty little houses sticking to it; The citizens of Bath, with vast delight, To hide their noble church from vulgar sight, Surround its venerable sides with shops, And decorate its walls with chimney tops! Surely from these designs, so pure, so chaste, Bath has been called emporium of taste: Oh! men of classic judgment! bear them hence To Grecian relics of magnificence; There let them deck (to prove their polished minds) Athenian temples with Venetian blinds! And, to perpetuate their own renown, Improve the Venus—with a satin gown! I cast my eyes around, and next observe The Royal Crescent with its graceful curve, And then above where other crescents grow, That seem to emulate the curve below; And there's the Circus, elegant no doubt, That bellows of which Brook Street is the snout; And mark where many a handsome building mounts, Streets, squares, and terraces, with freestone fronts; Whilst other edifices built for show, Mere lath and plaster, glitter in a row. But hold! enough of this perspective scene, I now proceed to show what moves within. 'Tis twelve at noon, or rather I should say, To fashionable folks 'tis break of day; Still on their downy pillows they repose, And Bath itself seems half inclined to doze. Here beaux and belles, to pass their hours away, Sport half the night, and slumber half the day; Whose nerves can scarce the load of life sustain, 'Till charming candlelight returns again, And thus the vulgar beams of daylight shun; While close drawn curtains quite exclude the sun. The constant youth, amid his slumbers, still Dreams of his partner in last night's quadrille; And though in sheets and blankets tuck'd up tight, Seems, in his sleep, to chasser to the right. With eyes but half unclosed, the rising fair Takes out the useful papers from her hair, Gives to each curl its most attractive grace, And puts her folding drapery in place; Upon her head arranged in varied dyes, Bows upon bows, and plumes on plumes arise; Where'er she goes, a crowd around her gathers, To view her charms as countless as her feathers; And for each conquest, and each beau's mishap She seems to add a feather in her cap. By day all languor—stretch'd upon the bed, With feeble body, and with aching head; Her limbs, extended motionless and faint, Seem chain'd and stiffen'd by some sad complaint; And her pale cheek, apparently, reveals A complication of all earthly ills. But night comes on; then friendly rouge supplies Health to her cheek, and brightness to her eyes; Her invalid envelopments give place To airy muslin, and transparent lace; And, drest for conquest, lovely dimples play Around those lips that scarcely moved all day. That tongue, which lately clothed in sickly white, Exposed its symptoms to the Doctor's sight, Now nimbly moves, from languor's bondage free, And charms the crowd with jest and repartee. Ladies, no longer young, but who in truth Retain the folly and conceit of youth, Are toiling to remove each wrinkled taint, By laying on another coat of paint, Are watering the buds that time has blighted, In fact are labouring to be delighted. The Lords of the Creation, half awake, Adorn themselves, their daily lounge to take; Each lordly man his taper waist displays, Combs his sweet locks, and laces on his stays, Ties on his starch'd cravat with nicest care, And then steps forth to petrify the fair. The streets begin to fill, the motley throng, To see and to be seen, now trip along; Some lounge in the Bazaars, whilst others meet To take a turn or two in Milsom Street; Some eight or ten round Mirvan's shop remain To stare at those who gladly stare again. All who are musical then call at White's, To buy the dances played on Thursday nights; Whilst he, to prove the value of his airs, And willing to exchange his notes for theirs, Bids his young man awake the trembling chords, To play the music set to Byron's words; And fur-clad dandies disregard each tone, Prizing no airs and graces but their own; Orpheus charmed stocks and stones—and he may claim, At times, an audience very much the same. Walking the streets, a stranger would suppose That half the tradesmen were about to close; Ranged in the windows, tempting bills are seen, Mentioning bargains to be found within; But “selling off” seems frequently alone A ruse de guerre to carry business on; And from its frequent use, it would appear They sell off regularly once a-year! Time flies! the ambulating throng grows less, The gay ones hasten home to dine and dress; The beaux in Milsom-Street, who sought renown By walking up, in order to walk down, All, all are gone, each well-drest form retreats, And scarce a dangler lingers in the streets. By day, the ladies constantly are seen In cloth or fur enveloped to the chin; But now 'tis evening, and the air grows colder, They strip, judiciously, the neck and shoulder; The chairs are ordered, and the moment comes When all the world assemble at the Rooms; For higher powers have decreed of late, That dancing shall commence at half-past eight! And should the dancers dare to disobey, And by their non-appearance cause delay, To throw at once perdition on their hopes, The new committee threaten them with ropes. Ranged on the benches sit the lookers on, Who criticise their neighbours one by one; Each thinks herself in word and deed so bless'd That she's a bright example for the rest; Numerous tales and anecdotes they hatch, And prophecy the dawn of many a match, And many a matrimonial scheme declare, Unknown to either of the happy pair. Much delicate discussion they advance About the dress and gait of those who dance: “This gown is made too short—and that too long, That lady's petticoats are pinn'd all wrong; One stoops too much, and one is so upright, He'll never see his partner all the night; One is too lazy, and the next too rough; This jumps too high, and that not high enough.” Thus each receives a pointed observation, Not that it's scandal! merely conversation. There politic mammas are always found Whose cash is scanty, but whose girls abound; They eye the danglers, calculate their pelf, And hope one daughter more will leave the shelf. Their sidelong glances and their smiles disclose Many steel traps to catch unwary beaux; But modern beaux, whose constant thoughts alone Are permanently fix'd on number one, In choosing partners—dream not of a wife, And love duets that do not last for life. The evening glides away in recreation, In whisper'd tête-à-tête, and sweet flirtation: (Report declares the youth is fairly caught, The day is fix'd, the bridal clothes are bought, Favours and cakes are order'd, without doubt— But then report at times is rather out); They each regale on ice and converse sweet, He kindly makès an offer—of his seat, The thing is talk'd of and declared by all; He makes proposals—to procure her shawl, And hands her off with gay and gallant air, Not to the altar—only to her chair! In this distinguish'd circle you will find Many degrees of man, and womankind; All but old women; saucy muse, for shame! In Bath 'tis wrong to mention such a name; Here, salutary rules exclude all those Whom no one hears of, and whom no one knows; That no plebeian breathings may infect An atmosphere at all times so select; No banker's clerks these splendid realms invade, No folks who carry on a retail trade, No actors by profession must appear, To act their parts or speak their speeches here; Yet even here, amid the crowds you view, 'Tis sometimes difficult to tell who's who. Subscription balls are also carried on By those who love to part with one pound one; “Elegant Extracts,” where they keep it up Till five or six, and sumptuously sup. A time there was, in gothic days, when all Were quite contented with a public ball; None issued invitations, I've been told, For more than rooms conveniently could hold. They, ignorantly, would have thought it airs To ask their friends and leave them on the stairs; But customs alter: folks, in times like these, Who give a party, call it what they please. The cards once out, it matters not at all Whether the drawing-room is large or small; They get a harp, the pleasure to enhance, And then the thing becomes a private dance. Whilst these select abodes their charms display, The young poussetting, as the old survey; Many at home remain, and treat their friends With cakes, cards, coffee, and wax candle ends. How wise are they, who thus, whilst others roam, Prefer sequestered joys, and stay at home. “At home!” what numberless delights are found, What sweet emotions mingle with the sound! 'Tis said, that far from cities, there are those Who daily in domestic scenes repose; To them their native home appears most dear, When doors are closed and none but friends are near. But here, to be “at home,” is to invite Half of the world to crowd your house at night, That all the other half may lie awake, Scared by the noise your doors and chairmen make. Here too, it seems, domestic joys consist In scandal, crowded rooms, ice creams, and whist; Candles and ladies' eyes here shine most bright, When both should be extinguished for the night. Inventions multiply, white-lies abound, Sometimes a solitary truth goes round, For those who talk all morning and all night, Must, inadvertently, at times be right. Oh! blest retreat; where beauteous dames impart The mingled charms of nature and of art; Art puts all faded objects out of sight, Whilst nature kindly brings all things to light. Ye favour'd beaux! these specimens behold, Catching your hearts, who thinks of catching cold? Their gowns they shorten too, and each reveals A proper quantity of neck and heels. But fashions change, and soon we may prepare To see the beaux as beautifully bare; Nor should the change surprise us, for the men Expose themselves a little now and then. Here you will find (the rites of Bacchus done) Men of all characters, and men of none. Here ancient bucks their wither'd limbs display, Vainly endeavouring to hide decay; Though still the form of symmetry is seen, And cork supplies the place where flesh has been. Though stays may compensate for vigour gone; Though white of eggs cement his whiskers on; Though artificial curls are neatly spread To hide the sad hiatus on his head: Can cork, or borrow'd curls Time's progress stop? Can age be strengthen'd by a whalebone prop? Do what he will—the number of his years Through all his boyish mummery appears; And age, from all the worth of age exempt, Can only be an object of contempt. Of gamesters too the motley throng consists, Of married debauchees and duellists: Bladud's hot water has been long renown'd, Which flows in ancient courses under ground; Apparently the tepid fluid runs Within the veins of some of Bladud's sons; Yet though these youths are often in hot water, It often ends in smoke, but not in slaughter. In this auspicious region all mankind (Whate'er their taste) congenial joys may find; Here monied men may pass for men of worth; And wealthy cits may hide plebeian birth. Here men devoid of cash may live with ease, Appear genteel, and pass for what they please; Here single men their better half may claim, And flirting spinsters lose that doleful name; Here husbands, weary of domestic strife, May please themselves, and live a single life; And married ladies, in their husband's view, May freely flirt, and boast their conquests too; Here boys and girls may marry in their teens, And live on visionary ways and means; Here fortune-hunting beaux delude the fair With large estates and castles in the air; Here lovely belles so sensitive appear, They fall in love at least four times a year; And dames, who well the board of green cloth know, Sit—where they sat near sixty years ago. Here busy Scandal's ever ready tongue Will interfere to regulate the young, Brings every hidden mystery to light, Corrects the weak, and sets the erring right, Declares what actions they should choose or shun, What they may do, and what must not be done. Here doctors conscientiously contrive, By daily calls, to keep their friends alive; Who, though declining, many days may see, Whilst daily calls produce a daily fee. All systems change, and physic, like the rest, When newly fashion'd operates the best; Thus each practitioner his system draws From some internal, ever-ruling cause, And laying former doctrines on the shelf, Cures by a mode peculiar to himself. One feels your pulse and potently observes— All your complaints originate in nerves. If still unsatisfied, the next you call Will vow that people have no nerves at all. One says the stomach is the tainted part, One says the head's in fault, and one the heart; One undertakes to set you up with ease, And swears that bile occasions your disease, Says bile affects you if you glow or shiver, And throws new lights upon his patient's liver. A time there was, ere modern ills were known, When matrons had a system of their own; Each wife possess'd a closet amply fill'd With drugs well mix'd, and waters well distill'd; Alternate food and physic stored her book, With precepts for the doctress and the cook; There sage prescriptions follow'd rich receipts, And nauseous bitters counteracted sweets. If sickness pain'd her spouse, her ready skill Possess'd a remedy for every ill; Each season'd dish, each potent draught she knew: She made him sick, and cured his sickness too. But this is past,—no spouse now risks his life, Trusting his constitution to his wife. Let London boast her stage, and still retain Her Covent-Garden and her Drury-Lane, So elegantly big, that scarce a word Of what is going forward can be heard, And perch'd aloft, it is in vain you hope To see the stage without a telescope; Here Bath presents a tempting bill of fare, At the new theatre, in Beaufort Square. Our theatre is neat, though there are seen No gas without, or gay saloons within; 'Tis small, I own, but whilst its size we scan— “These little things are great to little man.” What though our stage some few recruits may own, As senseless as the boards they tread upon; Though here at times some heroes may be found, Who bid defiance both to sense and sound,— Confounding every passage they rehearse, Bad by degrees and miserably worse; Yet in this soil, by favour's sunshine rear'd, Some buds of real talent have appear'd; And splendid stars now grace the London sphere, Whose earliest rays were nursed and kindled here. These are thy follies, Bath,—yet even here Some qualifying virtues oft appear; And having sketch'd the errors that pervade, 'Tis fair some light should mingle with the shade. All seem aware of what the proverb means, “Charity hides a multitude of sins;” And therefore keep their consciences secure, By many benefactions to the poor. Thus Mistress Whist this golden rule regards, And gives the poor the cash she wins at cards: Thus he who hears a worthy preacher speak Against his actions in the former week, Buys absolution at an easy rate, By placing his donation in the plate. At circulating libraries we view No tempting raffles, or delightful loo; No fair adventurers can there advance To try their luck at morning games of chance; No winners seize the spoils, or proudly share “Trifles from Brighton,” or gay Tonbridge ware. In these resorts the loungers take their stations, And ask to see the last new publications: Monthly Reviews, and Poems neatly stitch'd, Novels that tend to prove the world's bewitch'd, And Ladies' Magazines just come from town, With “Lines on Love,” and patterns for a gown; These Laura views, as if a hasty look Could estimate the value of a book; And if some touch of scandal she perceives, Some tale initialed, 'twixt the uncut leaves, She gladly pays the shopman the amount, Or begs he'll put it down to her account. Here maiden ladies constantly pursue Something they have not read, or “something new;” Some seek the reading-room, and there peruse, According to their tastes, the London news; The politician reads, with looks sedate, Letters from Paris, and last night's debate; The female is not happy till she sees The daily list of deaths and marriages. One, with uncommon thirst of knowledge blest, Thinks of herself unmindful of the rest, Seizes the Times, and not content with one, Grasps at the Globe, and sits upon the Sun! And now my task is o'er, my grey goose quill! Will others say we've acted well or ill? Methinks I hear the critic tribe discuss The merit of our lines, and argue thus— “What have we here, shall striplings seize the pen, And scan the faults of older, abler men? Is all this meant for wit?—or does he hope To lash with Churchill, ridicule with Pope? Shall any dare to tread in Anstey's path, And write satiric verses upon Bath?” I answer, I have imitated none, Such as they are, my thoughts have been my own; If none must tread where others trod before, Let no one dare compose a stanza more; Let no man deem it worth his while to think, Or idly waste his paper, pens, and ink; For if he writes, a footing he must get In some Parnassus undiscover'd yet. If in my lines no point of wit they view, It lacks the venom'd point of malice too; No individuals are here abused; No private characters are roughly used; No shafts are aim'd to injure worth or merit— I make the cap—but not the heads to wear it.
