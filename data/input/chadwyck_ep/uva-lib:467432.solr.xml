      <field name="fulltext">COUNTRY AIRS THE TREE-LOVER Sweet in the sweet May weather Trees go airy and bright; Winged with the gold-green feather, Veiled in the deep-sea light. Clad in the emerald silk, All a-flutter, a-glitter; Blossoms white as the milk, Never were roses sweeter. Leafy shadows, all dancing, Lovely in shine and shower, Ever twinkling and glancing, Birds have built them a bower. Lord of the leaf and tree, When 'tis time for my going, Leafing time let it be, Neither snowing nor blowing! After that journey taken Let me open my eyes To woods by a May-wind shaken, Full of the birds' replies! Paradise woods in Spring, Scarcely than Earth's were sweeter; Every leaf's on the wing, All a-flutter, a-glitter. Paradise woods in commotion, Tossed in a heavenly May; After the bitter ocean, Dear and homelike were they. Lord of the world to be, Build me no jasper palace, But the young leaf on the tree, And the young bloom on the trellis! THE VIOLET FARM If I might choose my simple lot Far from the town and quite forgot, All in a sheltered nook and warm, 'Tis I would have a violet farm. No daffodils should me entice, Nor hyacinths with their breath of spice, The tulip with her painted hood For me should wither where she stood. Instead of sheep upon the sward, The modest violet I would herd. Instead of golden heads arow, Would see my violet harvest blow. Under an arch of wild, wild cloud, Below an opal mountain bowed, All in a humid world and cool, With winds and waters beautiful. What airs across my farm should breathe! 'Tis sweet where pinks and roses wreath: But pinks and roses are not sweet Beside the hidden violet. No shortest day of all the year Should fade without a violet's cheer, Invisible sweetness hid within And folded up in swathes of green. Though white and purple babes be born When Daffodil his flaming horn O'er quiet hills and vales shall sound And stir the sleepers underground; What country bliss can equal mine, With violets for my flocks and kine, With violets for my corn and store? What could a mortal wish for more? Under a mountain pansy-dark, Loved of the eagle and the lark, And set too low for fear or harm, 'Tis I would have a violet farm. SWEET PEA Like butterflies that hover The reddest rose-tree over, Or rosy bee, The rosiest rose's lover. Or like rose-leaves caught flying In loveliest flight undying, The sweet, sweet pea Sets all the winds to sighing. Scarlet and rose together, She takes the brilliant weather Like humming-bird That flaunts a scarlet feather. So strong, so fine, so airy, Poised like a tiptoe fairy, That careless word Sets off, or foot unwary. Ready for flight, yet never Her links with earth to sever, So lingers she, One foot on earth for ever. But in gold air and azure, Yet treads her heavenly measure; The winged sweet pea Dances for her sweet pleasure. THE CHOICE When skies are blue and days are bright A kitchen-garden's my delight, Set round with rows of decent box And blowsy girls of hollyhocks. Before the lark his Lauds hath done And ere the corncrake's southward gone; Before the thrush good-night hath said And the young Summer's put to bed. The currant-bushes' spicy smell, Homely and honest, likes me well. The while on strawberries I feast, And raspberries the sun hath kissed. Beans all a-blowing by a row Of hives that great with honey go, With mignonette and heaths to yield The plundering bee his honey-field. Sweet herbs in plenty, blue borage And the delicious mint and sage, Rosemary, marjoram, and rue, And thyme to scent the winter through. Here are small apples growing round, And apricots all golden-gowned, And plums that presently will flush And show their bush a Burning Bush. Cherries in nets against the wall, Where Master Thrush his madrigal Sings, and makes oath a churl is he Who grudges cherries for a fee. Lavender, sweet-briar, orris. Here Shall Beauty make her pomander, Her sweet-balls for to lay in clothes That wrap her as the leaves the rose. Take roses red and lilies white, A kitchen-garden 's my delight; Its gillyflowers and phlox and cloves, And its tall cote of irised doves. THE HERMIT Who, counting human joys as vain, Departeth from the ways of men, And to the desert takes his road Rejoicing for the love of God; Who dieth to the human hive That he may save his soul alive, Shakes from his feet the dust of sin, And with much weeping is made clean; Him shall the desert sweetly please, Sweeter than musk or ambergris; Unto his sands with song and sport Companion angels shall resort. The roseate clouds at dawn shall blow Angels his way, and clouds of snow Drift angels to the earth and make Ladders of silver for his sake. In his palm-tree shall angels stir Skilled in the lute and dulcimer, And with their golden wing-feathers Shall fan him from the noontide airs. And by his well shall angels lean And see the golden heads within; Their hands the date and fig shall bring To make his meal at evening. Him shall no evil beast affright Since angels guard him day and night; The vultures they have fled afar From where God's feathered people are. Sweet his estate who in the wild, No more mere mortal man exiled, Looks up, from his tear-watered sod, And sees in heaven the smile of God. SUMMER NIGHT All in the leafy lanes The glow-worm lights his lamp. The nightingale complains In scented dew and damp. The nightingale her ache Bares to the lonely night, When there is none awake, Nothing in vale or height. The glow-worm lights his lamp Under the blossomed may, Hung in the dew and damp His lamp lights up the way. The nightingale complains All night to field and grove; The glow-worm in the lanes Hath lit a lamp to Love. THE PASTORAL PILGRIM For me the town sets forth in vain Her painted pleasures in a train. For I arise and go To a delicious world I know. There the gold-fretted fields are set Like pearls within a carcanet With daisies fine and fresh, And kingcups tangled in a mesh. The pastoral lands I seek where stray The strawberry cattle and the gray, Knee deep in dew and scent, Placid, and breathing forth content. Brave copses line each hill, and there The pleasant habitations are With roses to the eaves, And nightingales amid the leaves. When I shall wake there to the sun And the birds' early antiphon, And lusty bee his chant, How shall I grieve, how shall I want? Sweet peas and dappled mignonette Below my crystal window set, Clear air and lucent skies, And the dove's whispers and replies. A garden and an orchard white And pinkâan orchard's my delight, Whose very name doth bring Airs of the summer, joy of spring. And having these shall I repine For houses, houses in a line, With other men to dwell? Give me my staff and cockle-shell. ROSES The moon hid her face to-night, Veiled her in roses, Rose-leaves in brilliant flight From the sun's closes. Rose of a million leaves, How she is scattered! Like to earth's rose that grieves, Dewless, unwatered. Over the leaf-green sky Rose-leaves are drifting; Now the wind heaps them high, Now is a sifting. There in the midmost flare Dian, capricious, Draws the rose o'er her hair, Scented, delicious. There from the rosiest heaps Dian discloses Dimly her eyes and lips, Smiling through roses. THE OLD LOVE Out of my door I step into The country, all her scent and dew, Nor travel there by a hard road, Dusty and far from my abode. The country washes to my door Green miles on miles in soft uproar, The thunder of the woods, and then The backwash of green surf again. Beyond the feverfew and stocks, The guelder-rose and hollyhocks; Outside my trellised porch a tree Of lilac frames a sky for me. A stretch of primrose and pale green To hold the tender Hesper in; Hesper that by the moon makes pale Her silver keel and silver sail. The country silence wraps me quite, Silence and song and pure delight; The country beckons all the day Smiling, and but a step away. This is that country seen across, How many a league of love and loss, Prayed for and longed for, and as far As fountains in the desert are. This is that country at my door, Whose fragrant airs run on before, And call me when the first birds stir In the green wood to walk with her. THE FOOTPATH WAY The winding road lies white and bare, Heavy in dust that takes the glare, The thirsty hedgerows and parched grass Dream of a time when no road was. Beyond, the fields are full in view; Heavy in herbage and in dew The great-eyed kine browse thankfully; Come, take the footpath way with me! This stile, where country lovers tryst, Where many a man and maid have kissed, Invites us sweetly, and the wood Beckons us to her solitude. Leave men and lumbering wains behind, And dusty roads, all blank and blind; Come, tread on velvet and on silk, Damasked with daisies, white as milk. Those dryads of the wood, that some Call the wild hyacinths, now are come, And hold their revels in a night Of emerald flecked with candle-light. The fountains of the meadows play, This is the wild bee's holiday; When summer-snows have sweetly drest The pasture like a wedding-guest, By fields of beans that shall eclipse The honey on the rose's lips, With woodruff and the new hay's breath, And wild thyme sweetest in her death. Skirting the rich man's lawn and hall, The footpath way is free to all; For us his pinks and roses blow: Fling him thanksgiving ere we go! By orchards yet in rosy veils, By hidden nests of nightingales, Through lonesome valleys where all day The rabbit people scurry and play, The footpath sets her tender lure. This is the country for the poor; The high-road seeks the crowded sea; Come, take the footpath way with me! POPPY The poppy flaunts a petticoat Of airy films that fly and float; Of fairy gauzes, fairy-fine, Lucent and crystalline. Lighter than lightest gossamer, Or the moth's wing at eve astir; Frills of the scarlet set arow, And rosiest rose on snow. No dancing Graces can reveal Flounces like hers from knee to heel; No fairy twirl of fairy girl Scatters such rose and pearl. The fairies laundered this last night, A glow-worm light for candle-light; This in the dews was washed and steeped While drowsy mortals slept. The little fairy fingers feat Ironed it out so neat and sweet, And set the frills with dainty skill, Ruffled at the wind's will. The poppy wears her silk and lace, Clear-starched, with such a delicate grace, Her silken flounces hides and shows As the wind goes and blows. THE WIND IN THE TREES Sound of waters in the tree All new-leafed and heavenly, Waters going, waters flowing To some far belovÃ¨d sea. Every tree is vocal; under The clear bird-notes a soft thunder Of the waters flowing, going Some dim waterway of wonder. Sound of waters hurrying past, Rivers travelling, quiet, fast, Many waters, flowing, growing, Find the belovÃ¨d sea at last. IN MAY Thrushes in twilight green Sing from a leafy screen; The linnet and the lark, Only in deepest dark, Sleep the still hours away Betwixt the day and day. The blackbird calls and calls Through quiet evenfalls, Breaking the heart to know Such songs must pass, must go, Such beauty die, alas, Beauty of things that pass! Just for a day, an hour, Such green in bush and bower. Airy as things with wings Mortal, immortal things, Dearer because, alas, Their hour runs in the glass! Good-bye, ah, sweetest sweeting, Pouring that heavenly greeting! Music to-night, to-morrow The world is old for sorrow. Even as you sing you fly. Beauty, good-night, good-bye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CHILDREN BABY'S SONG The very song the blackbird sung When Love and all the world were young My year-old baby sings, Sweeter than anything with wings. A little song, with catch and trill Made of few notes and little skill, A song for dancing feet Of babes and birds and all things sweet. The baby dances as he sings Sweeter than anything with wings, And sways his golden headâ To the first song the blackbird made. THE CHILD'S CALL He calls with quick, insistent cry, He calls at work or play, And I must put my business by, And all my books away. He summons me from household cares Back to his sunny room, And up the stairs and up the stairs In happy haste I come. Sweeter than lark and mavis dear, And nightingales in May, The little voice so shrill and clear That I must yet obey. While up the stairs and to the door My heart runs on in glee, I hear a voice I knew of yore That never calls for me. Ever through shadow-time and sun I hear a baby call, That is not you, my precious one, That is not you at all. Afar, where heavenly waters flow 'Mid Paradisal calms, All on a sward where lilies blow The Shepherd counts his lambs. Afar, beyond the wintry cold Upon the heavenly hill, A little lamb a few weeks old Bleats for his mother still. O mother's love and mother's joy! But while I come in haste, I hear another lovely boy Cry from the lonely past. And while I kiss your curls aside And hold you to my breast, I kiss the little boy that died, That will not let me rest. ROSA SPINOSA Seven sad swords had Mary's heart, Seven sad wounds to ache and smart; That young rose, her Baby, blowing, Put forth thorns for her undoing: Thorns to pierce the milky breast Where He grew and took His rest. O my rose of joy and grief, Set with thorns in stem and leaf, As her heart was piercÃ¨d thorough, So my heart with love and sorrow. Little rose of thorns, come close To the heart you stab so, Rose! THE SHADOW-CHILD He sees his own sweet shadow fall At evening on the lamp-lit wall, With shrill delighted cries; And deems another boy it is, With small, uncertain feet like his, That at his coming flies. His own gold mop of hair so wild Crowns with wild grace the shadow-child; His quaint, broad shape behold! His own dear bobbing gait he sees, Like daisies dancing on the leas When all the world is gold. His smock-frock to his feet is there, As smock-frocks were your only wear. And when kind Nurse will throw Live rabbits on the wall, not one But two boys clap their hands for fun And dance to see the show. Wasteful of sweets, he leans to kiss This well-beloved playmate of his, But lo! the boy is gone Into the night, into the rain. Yet see how fast he comes again, And see how fast is flown! BLUE EYES The little boy we might not keep Had such great eyes of heaven, such eyes: Deeper than sapphires and more deep Than any seas or skies. Such eyes of wonder opened wide On the strange world; he drank his fill, While other babies slept and cried, Of wonder, wondering still. âWhat is it that he sees?â we said, And followed in the wonder's track. But when the little one was dead That wondering gaze came back. O are you wondering, wondering still? For now you see such wondrous things, Such angels by the field and rill, With wondrous head and wings. O are you wondering, wondering yet, At the kind breast you lie upon, And the kind eyes that once were wet For a most holy Son? Our little boy with wondering eyes, I wonder will they wonder still, Or meet our own with no surprise When we come over the hill! THE ONLY CHILD Lest he miss other children, lo! His angel is his playfellow. A riotous angel two years old, With wings of rose and curls of gold. There on the nursery floor together They play when it is rainy weather, Building brick castles with much pain, Only to knock them down again. Two golden heads together look An hour long o'er a picture-book, Or, tired of being good and still, They play at horses with good will. And when the boy laughs you shall hear Another laughter silver-clear, Sweeter than music of the skies, Or harps, or birds of Paradise. Two golden heads one pillow press, Two rosebuds shut for heaviness. The wings of one are round the other Lest chill befall his tender brother. All day, with forethought mild and grave, The little angel's quick to save. And still outruns with tender haste The adventurous feet that go too fast. From draughts, from fire, from cold and stings, Wraps him within his gauzy wings; And knows his father's pride, and shares His happy mother's tears and prayers. TOBY'S HAIR Brown as salmon streams that hold Wanton sunbeams in their snare, Bronze, and powdered through with goldâ Toby's hair. Swarms of dancing fireflies bright Shed on bracken, everywhere, Till the dark is starred with lightâ Toby's hair. Sparks upon a fire of peat Make a delicate flight in air, So with sudden life is lit Toby's hair, Silk and soft and fairy-spun, Such gold-brown as pansies wear. See, it gathers all the sun, Toby's hair! THE VANE The East Wind stays and stays, Unkind to man and beast; I had not known in the old days If it was West or East. But Love has bid me learn What winds be kind, be keen, And how the glittering vane will turn The chimney-pots between. The East Wind blows and blows, Too rough for a gold head, Harsh for a little human rose, All rosy-white and red. Pack, East Wind, and be off, Back to your arid plain, And bid the West the children love Turn round the gilded vane! THE NEW NURSE When other children shut their eyes The sick child coughs and weeps alone, And Nanna, Nanna, Nanna, cries, Because the nurse he loved is gone. Between the coughing, with new hope Watches the door she will not ope. Between the coughing listens keen For feet upon the nursery stair. The nursery hearth is bright and clean, The walls have pictures rich and rare. Alas, the little luckless wight, Whose world has gone to pieces quite! Alack, the dear remembered head, Black on its pillow through the year! The terrible stranger wears instead Light hair. O Nanna, Nanna dear, Where do you hide through his alarms Your comfortable breast and arms? Alone with her the long night through And illâcould anything be worse? No goblin's grimmer in his view Than this cold, patient, stranger nurse. But though he calls for Nanna still, No Nanna comes nor ever will. HIS KNOWLEDGE âNo one will love you if you're naughty,â said His nurse, demure and chill. The Three-years Wisdom shook his bird-bright head, And answered, âMother will.â He built a castle of his bricks the while, Poised tower and bastion still; As one who suffers Folly with a smile, He answered, âMother will.â âADVENIAT REGNUM TUUMâ Thy kingdom come! Yea, bid it come. But when Thy kingdom first began On earth, Thy kingdom was a home, A child, a woman, and a man. The child was in the midst thereof, O, blessed Jesus, holiest One! The centre and the fount of love Mary and Joseph's little Son. Wherever on the earth shall be A child, a woman, and a man, Imaging that sweet trinity Wherewith Thy kingdom first began, Establish there Thy kingdom! Yea, And o'er that trinity of love Send down, as in Thy appointed day, The brooding spirit of Thy Dove! SHADOW His sunshine lies upon my path, Its glory bathes me every place. Who talked of trouble and of death In this sweet world that knows his face? His shadow lies upon my heart, And where I go runs on before; Its ghostly presence never apart Darkens my threshold, bars my floor. Child, what have I done, to bear Such weight of Love and its annoy? For still the shadow shape of Fear Outruns the hurrying feet of Joy. THE NURSE Such innocent companionship Is hers, whether she wake or sleep, 'Tis scarcely strange her face should wear The young child's grave and innocent air. All the night long she hath by her The quiet breathing, the soft stir, Nor knows how in that tender place The children's angels veil the face. She wakes at dawn with bird and child To earth new-washed and reconciled, The hour of silence and of dew, When God hath made His world anew. She sleeps at eve, about the hour Of bedtime for the bird and flower, When daisies, evening primroses, Know that the hour of closing is. Her daylight thoughts are all on toys And games for darling girls and boys, Lest they should fret, lest they should weep, Strayed from their heavenly fellowship. She is as pretty and as brown As the wood's children far from town, As bright-eyed, glancing, shy of men As any squirrel, any wren. Tender she is to beast and bird, As in her breast some memory stirred Of days when those were kin of hers Who go in feathers and in furs. A child, yet is the children's law, And rules by love and rules by awe. And, stern at times, is kind withal As a girl-baby with her doll. Outside the nursery door there lies The world with all its griefs and sighs, Its needs, its sins, its stains of sense: Within is only innocence. TALISMAN All Heaven in my arm. The child for a charm 'Gainst fear and 'gainst sorrow, To-day and to-morrow. The child for a charm Betwixt me and harm. O mouth, full of kisses! Small body of blisses! Your hand on my neck And your cheek to my cheek. What shall hurt me or harm With all Heaven in my arm? MATERNITY Her body, sweet to be his food, Yields him his precious milk and good. No body of death but life, see then The sacred body of Motherhood! Her heart, by one sweet guest renewed, Hath room for all earth's hapless brood. Yea, wounds for all earth's hurt children, The broken heart of Motherhood!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MANY MOODS APRIL A black North Wind that chills New leaves and songs scarce sung; It was not so in Aprils When I was young. Thrush-notes and blackbird-trills The blossomy boughs among; All in the leafy Aprils When I was young. Showers on the heavenly hills Rainbow and silver hung; Such tears and smiles were April's When I was young. Small streams and babbling rills, Green ways where gossamers swung; The young lambs leaped in Aprils When I was young. Daisies and daffodils, Primroses newly sprung; Fragrant and fresh the Aprils When I was young. Here in this town that kills, The heart for cold is wrung. It's O for the happy Aprils When I was young! MATER DEI She looked to east, she looked to west, Her eyes, unfathomable, mild, That saw both worlds, came home to rest,â Home to her own sweet child. God's golden head was at her breast. What need to look o'er land and sea? What could the winged ships bring to her? What gold or gems of price might be, Ivory or miniver, Since God Himself lay on her knee? What could th' intense blue heaven keep To draw her eyes and thoughts so high? All heaven was where her Boy did leap, Where her foot quietly Went rocking the dear God asleep. The angel folk fared up and down A Jacob's Ladder hung between Her quiet chamber and God's Town. She saw unawed, serene; Since God Himself played by her gown. SLOW SPRING As the day lengthens, the year strengthens. Strengthen, young year! Grow strong and handsome, gallant and winsome, Comely and dear. Gray days shall hold you, sweet days shall fold you, Till there shall come The wind-flowers dancing, the tulips glancing, The swallows home. The nests not yet in the grass are set For larks in the sky To love you madly and hail you gladly, Hail you and die. The rose-tree shows not a trace of the rose That shall crown your head. The leaves are furled in a silent world Till your word be said. O year, grow slowly. Exquisite, holy, The days go on With almonds showing the pink stars blowing, And birds in the dawn. Grow slowly, year, like a child that is dear, Or a lamb that is mild, By little steps, and by little skips, Like a lamb or a child. THE FAITHFUL LOVER Cheer up now, my daughter, I have news for your pleasure: A young man, a rich man, comes seeking my treasure. Now say, shall I tell him that he may come wooing? You are young, little daughter, and the past past undoing, The dead sleeping quiet. O mother, little mother, do you think I'm forgetting The long woe and fever, the fear and the fretting, That the love of my heart still is tossing unburied, At the will of the waves, by the winter winds hurried Here and there through the riot? I am not forgetting, little daughter, your lover, The brown head, the dear head the bitter waves cover; But his soul is in glory, nor jealous nor grieving. Turn round, little daughter, and think on the living: You shall ride in your carriage. I would rather be his widow than a great chieftain's lady; And 'tis, O that in shadow our one grave stood ready! With my head on his breast and my mouth for his kisses, I would envy no fond, faithful lover his blisses, No sweet bride her marriage. He has acres and crops and a mansion and cattle, And a proud name well honoured on old fields of battle; With his gold locks, his blue eyes, his smile true and tender, 'Tis to him many a young maid her love would surrender, For sunshine or shadow. Now sleep, my sweet sorrow, as a babe with its mother On the breast that shall know not the child of another. Go bid my young sister, with eyes gay and fearless, To comfort this young man for a cold heart and cheerless, The heart of a widow. THE WEEPING BABE She kneels by the cradle Where Jesus doth lie; Singing, Lullaby, my Baby! But why dost Thou cry? The babes of the village Smile sweetly in sleep; And lullaby, my Baby, That ever dost weep! I've wrapped Thee in linen, The gift of the Kings; And wool, soft and fleecy, The kind Shepherd brings. There's a dove on the trellis, And wings in the door, And the gold shoes of angels Are bright on our floor. Then lullaby, my Baby! I've fed Thee with milk, And wrapped Thee in kisses As soft as the silk. And here are red roses, And grapes from the vine, And a lamb trotting softly, Thy playfellow fine. Now smile, little Jesus, Whom naught can defile; All gifts will I give Thee An thou wilt but smile. But it's lullaby, my Baby! And mournful am I, Thou cherished little Jesus, That still Thou wilt cry. MOUNTAIN ROSE Cold and rough the North Wind blows, Black in the morning early. Whom should I meet but Mountain Rose Among the stubble barley? All the world is under snows; Blowing 'tis and snowing. Whom should I meet but Mountain Rose The way that I was going? Not a leaf on the poplar-tree, Not a flower on the heather. Mountain Rose looked shyly at me As we stepped out together. Mountain Rose, so airy and free, Where are roses blowing? Rose's cheek, half-turned from me, The rose of love was showing. Black and cold the North Wind blows, Never a bird is singing. There's a lilt in the voice of Rose Sweet as the skylark ringing. Winter's black on heather and broom, Where shall I find honey? Rose's mouth is the honeycomb, And Rose's laugh is sunny. Black and cold the North Wind blows, Winter comes in fairly. I keep Summer with Mountain Rose Among the stubble barley. THE BIRDS' BARGAIN âO spare my cherries in the net,â Brother Benignus prayed; âand I Summer and winter, shine and wet, Will pile the blackbirds' table high.â âO spare my youngling peas,â he prayed, âThat for the Abbot's table be, And every blackbird shall be fed; Yea, they shall have their fill,â said he. His prayer, his vow, the blackbirds heard, And spared his shining garden-plot. In abstinence went every bird, All the old thieving ways forgot. He kept his promise to his friends, And daily set them finest fare Of corn and meal and manchet-ends, With marrowy bones for winter bare. Brother Benignus died in grace: The brethren keep his trust, and feed The blackbirds in this pleasant place, Purged, as dear heaven, from strife and greed. The blackbirds sing the whole year long, Here where they keep their promise given, And do the mellowing fruit no wrong. Brother Benignus smiles in heaven. MOTHER-COUNTRY She is the mother-country, she, 'Mid fields and hills and mists so gray, That calls about her tender knee Her wandering children far away. Her voice is like a lullaby. 'Tis O, the mother's arms within To close awhile the sleepy eye And feel the time of rest begin! The sweetest heart, the softest breast, To win her children and to keep. There where the dream of rest is best Rock us to sleep, rock us to sleep! GREEN BUSHES The green bushes when first I loved you, When we met and my heart approved you, Tossed the gold and the scarlet high, Gold and scarlet went drifting by. Ochone, the wind and the weather! Days when you and I were together; Much we heeded the leaf on the tree: 'Twas heart's spring-time to you and me. The green bushes when we were married White rose and the red rose carried, When you drew me your threshold o'er, Rose and white for our wedding floor. Ochone, the days that are over! I beloved, and you my lover, Little we cared what the world might say, You and I on our wedding day. The green bushes grow thin and shiver, You and I we are lovers ever; Cheek to cheek and heart to heart, Still true lovers whom none can part. Ochone, winter goes sighing, Love in a world of care and dying; Ah, forget that I made you sad, Yet remember I made you glad. The green bushes grow gray and vernal, Spring comes back and Love is eternal; In your arms come kiss, forgive me: Had you ever the heart to grieve me, Ochone? IMMORTALITY So I have sunk my roots in earth Since that my pretty boys had birth; And fear no more the grave and gloom, I, with the centuries to come. As the tree blossoms so bloom I, Flinging wild branches to the sky; Renew each year my leafy suit, Strike with the years a deeper root. Shelter a thousand birds to be, A thousand herds give praise to me; And in my kind and grateful shade How many a weary head be laid. I clothe myself without a stain. In me a child is born again, A child that looks with innocent eyes On a new world with glad surprise. The old mistakes are all undone, All the old sins are purged and gone. Old wounds and scars have left no trace, There are no lines in this young face. To hear the cuckoo the first time, And 'mid new roses in the prime To read the poets newly. This, Year after year, shall be my bliss. Of me shall Love be born anew, I shall be loved and lover too; Years after this poor body has died Shall be the bridegroom and the bride Of me shall mothers spring to know The mother's bliss, the mother's woe; And children's children yet to be Shall learn their prayers about my knee. And many million lights of home Shall light for me the time to come. Unto me much shall be forgiven, I that make many souls for heaven. ALICE Without surcease of breath Her soul hath slipped its sheath, And walks among us, beautiful, unafraid, So mortal eyes may see How immortality Transcends all beauty that must fail and fade. Colours of air and flame, The glory whence she came, Yet float about her in our dusty sphere. Silence and rapture still Brought from the heavenly hill, Whence she hath travelled to our exile drear. Slight as a lance she is, And tall as Lent lilies, Aspiring like a flame in windless air. Incense and breath of spice, Kept from her Paradise, Haunt her from slender feet to ebon hair. Lingering and lovely voiceâ Lutes, dulcimers, hautboysâ Her voice remembers how the music went, Still holds the rise and fall, The sob ecstatical, Of some most heavenly-sweet wind instrument. THE RETURN When we came back to the old beloved places, Home of our dreams, we had forgotten quite Days of our grief when new o'er little faces Grass waved and dew fell in the starless night. Leaves of green silk, laughing skies of azure, Rose freshly blowing, and birds in the bowers: So in that May the Spring spilled out her treasure, Young Love went walking knee-deep in flowers. Just for a space our hearts forgetting wholly Wreckage of winter and blight in the groves; How Death came walking heavily and slowly O'er the saddest garlands that once were Love's. Mercy of mercies! We were so glad returning, Old griefs forgotten, old joys renewed; Death that was Life no longer wears the mourning, Death that was Love hath raised his shadowy hood. A PRAYER Now wilt me take for Jesus' sake, Nor cast me out at all; I shall not fear the foe awake, Saved by Thy City wall; But in the night with no affright Shall hear him steal without, Who may not scale Thy wall of might, Thy bastion, nor redoubt. Full well I know that to the foe Wilt yield me not for aye, Unless mine own hand should undo The gates that are my stay; My folly and pride should open wide Thy doors and set me free 'Mid tigers striped and panthers pied Far from Thy liberty. Unless by debt myself I set Outside Thy loving ken, And yield myself by weight of debt Unto my fellow-men. Deal with my guilt Thou as Thou wilt, And âholdâ I shall not cry, So I be Thine in storm and shine, Thine only till I die. PARENTHOOD These are the years our God Lays down, and nothing loth, His sceptre and His rod As He were tired of both. Bids men and women take His empire for a while, To ban, to bless, to make The children weep or smile. All power be yours, He saith, Over My little ones: The power of life and death, The power of clouds and suns. The power of weal and harm Be yours to have and hold: In you they shall go warm, In you be pinched with cold. Just for these God-like years Ye shall not know th' intense Pang beyond prayers and tears Of your love's impotence. Be yours to make, to mar, This lovely thing I wrought, With love brought from afar, And My eternal thought. This fashioned I of joy, Much hope, without a stain, Pure gold without alloy Redeemed in mine own pain. For this the wine-press trod, Ensanguined to the knee. Afterwardsâsaith our Godâ Ye will account to Me. For every needless tear, For all the smiles unsmiled, For lonely wrong and fear Wrought on My little child, Myself will exact the fee, A God of wrath and scorn: Better that day that ye Were dead ere ye were born. ContrariwiseâHis wrath Our Lord God put awayâ Your watchful love till death I will repay, repay. Lord of the skies and lands Take pity on Thy dust, Strengthen our mortal hands Lest we betray Thy trust! RECALL As the blue swallow flies, Tracking the summer, As the gray pigeon hies, Ever a homer. So on her sunset path Goes my heart flying, Fears not the storm-wind's wrath Nor the sea's sighing. Wears like the sea-swallows Sea's tints upon her, Goes as the carrier goes, Ringed by her owner. Westward she flieth forth, And who shall bind her? Looks not to south or north, East lies behind her. Like a gold flash she gleams, Straight to the sunset; Hurls her o'er seas and streams With a wild onset. Straight to that tender heart, By the dim water. If they might never part, Mother and daughter! THE LEGEND OF ST. AUSTIN AND THE CHILD St. Austin, going in thought Along the sea-sands gray, Into another world was caught, And Carthage far away. He saw the City of God Hang in the saffron sky; And this was holy ground he trod, Where mortals come not nigh. He saw pale spires aglow, Houses of heavenly sheen; All in a world of rose and snow, A sea of gold and green. There amid Paradise The saint was rapt away From unillumined sands and skies And floor of muddy clay. His soul took wings and flew, Forgetting mortal stain, Upon the track of that bright crew That homed to heaven again. Forgetting mortal dearth It seized on heavenly things, Till it was cast again to earth, Because it had not wings. Because the Three in One He could not understand, Baffled and beaten and undone, He gazed o'er sea and land. Then by a little pool A lovely child he saw; A harmless thing and beautiful, And yet so full of awe, That with a curved sea-shell, Held in his rosy hand, Had scooped himself a little well Within the yielding sand. And to and fro went he, Between it and the wave, Bearing his shell filled with the sea, To find a sandy grave. âWhat is it that you do, You lovely boy and bold?â âI empty out the ocean blue, You man so wise and old! âSee you how in this cup I bind the great sea's girth!â âAh no, the gray sands suck it up Your cup is little worth. âNow put your play aside, And let the ocean be. Tell me your name, O violet-eyed, That empty out the sea! âWhat lineage high and fine Is yours, O kingly boy, That sure art sprung of royal line, A people's hope and joy.â âAustin, as you have said, A crown my Sire doth wear, My mother was a royal maid And yet went cold and bare.â He shook his golden curls, A scornful laugh laughed he. âThe night that I was born, the churls, They would not shelter me. âOnly the ox and ass, The night that I was born, Made me a cradle of the grass And watched by me till morn. âThe night that I was born The ass and ox alone, Betwixt the midnight and the morn, Knelt down upon the stone. âThe bitter night I came, Each star sang in its sphere. Now riddle, riddle me my name, My Austin tried and dear.â Austin is on his face, Before that vision bright. âMy Lord, what dost Thou in this place With such a sinful wight?â âI come not here in wrath, But I come here in love, My Austin, skilled in life and death, Thy vanity to prove. âMortal, yet over-bold To fly where th' eagle flies, As soon this cup the sea will hold As thou My Mysteries. âPatience a little yet, And thou shalt be with Me, And in thy soul's small cup unmeet Myself will pour the sea.â When Austin raised his head No child was there beside, But in the cup the Child had made There swelled the rising tide.</field>
