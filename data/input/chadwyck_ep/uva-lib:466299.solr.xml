      <field name="fulltext">[Why hast Thou for our earthly gloom] âHE LAYETH IT ON HIS SHOULDERS REJOICING.â St. Luke xv. 6: âI have found My sheep which was lost.â âO good Shepherd, I thank Thee for Thy tender care and concern for Thy lost sheep. I had indeed been for ever lost, had not Thy love sought and found me when I was astray: for Thy goodness' sake keep me, for the time to come, from wandering from Thee and from Thy fold.â Bp. Wilson's Prayers. Why hast Thou for our earthly gloom Thus left Thy Father's hall? âNot for the righteous am I come, But sinners to recall.â What bear'st Thou from yon desert rock Upon Thy shoulders bound? âA sheep that left My Father's flock, Whom I have lost and found.â What is it causes Angels' mirth 'Mid sons of God in Heaven? â'Tis some poor sorrowing child of earth Who is of God forgiven.â What makes the gracious Father rise, And hasten from His seat? â'Tis one in distance He descries, A long-lost son to meet.â What is that poor and abject thing, Washing Thy feet with tears? âOne that would hide beneath My wing Her sin and shame and fears.â In Paradise who is that one That hastes Thy side along? âOne of earth's outcasts I have won; With Me in death he hung.â Dear words to sinner, at the door Who feels Thy judgment near; And still the more he mourns, the more These words of love are dear. [THE GOOD SHEPHERD] âI HAVE GONE ASTRAY, LIKE A SHEEP THAT IS LOST.â Good Shepherd, bear Thy long-lost sheep Upon Thy shoulders home; By Thine own side the wanderer keep, That I no longer roam. When, viewing all the past, I think How I have gone astray, My spirit doth within me sink; I feel me far away. Thy words, in trembling fear and love, Then o'er and o'er I read, Pledging that Thou from heaven above Wilt come down in our need; That Thou wilt all our sorrows own When most we feel forlorn, And Angels which surround Thy throne Will pity them that mourn. With them that mourn loss of Thy grace, In sorrow and in fear, The Angels which surround Thy face And Thou Thyself art near. The Warning of Joseph. No sooner is our Saviour born Than He is mark'd by woe; Those who love Him must learn to mourn And suffer pain below. His parents have done no man wrong, That they must flee away; But all who unto Him belong Will this bad world betray. Yet they are unto God above And holy angels dear; Bright are their footsteps in His love, Calm'd by His holy fear. To Joseph in a vision deep The angel now return'd, And all around him in his sleep The light celestial burn'd. The Flight into Egypt. Be still, thou wintry Storm, Nor hurt her gentle form; Shine out again from far, Thou Bethlehem's lowly Star; Their pathway strew, thou Earth, For Him who gave thee birth, By Virgin-mother trod, The mother with her God. From nightly winds so wild She wraps her Holy Child; In each thought of unrest, She clasps Him to her breast. Good Joseph by her side Hastes, like a Heaven-sent guide; While Faith throughout the night, Than morning star more bright; And round them holy Love A peaceful light doth prove. [THE CLEANSING OF THE TEMPLE] It is written, My house shall be called the House of Prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. S. Matt. xxi. 13. Ye who approach God's House of Prayer Remember God Himself is there, Though not beheld by eyes of sense; Do Him all lowly reverence. Remember Christ the Crucified Was like a Lamb in all beside; But in His Father's House His zeal Did the avenging Judge reveal. All that profaned He swept from thence, Dreadful in His omnipotence; And 'mid them, with uplifted rod, Stood terrible the Almighty God. There is He still, although unseenâ Take heed no deed or thought unclean Enter within that sacred door, Or tread upon that hallow'd floor. Let not the thoughts of merchandise In thine unheeding breast arise; Nor pleasure past, nor future care, Dare breathe within that hallow'd air. To eyes of faith there God is found, The angel hosts keep watch around; Upon thine heart are countless eyes, As if admitted to the skies. Thus when men know not He is near, In His own House shall He appear, And drive with scourge of endless woe All that defiles His Church below. [THE WIDOW OF NAIN] âHE WAS THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER, AND SHE WAS A WIDOW.ââLuke vii. 12. âThe whole tale of misery is told in a few words. The mother was a widow, and had no hope of having children; she had no one upon whom she might look in the place of him that was dead. To him alone she had given suck; he alone made her home cheerful. All that is sweet and precious to a mother, was he alone to her.ââSt. Gregory Nyssen. Who says the widow's heart must break, The childless mother sink?â A kinder, truer voice I hear, Which even beside that mournful bier Whence parents' eyes would hopeless shrink, Bids weep no more.âO heart bereft, How strange to thee that sound! A widow o'er her only son, Feeling more bitterly alone For friends that press officious round. Yet is the voice of comfort heard, For Christ hath touched the bierâ The bearers wait with wondering eye, The swelling bosom dares not sigh, But all is still, 'twixt hope and fear. Even such an awful soothing calm We sometimes see alight On Christian mourners, while they wait In silence, by some churchyard-gate, Their summons to the holy rite. And such the tones of love which break The stillness of that hour, Quelling th' embittered spirit's strifeâ âThe Resurrection and the Life Am I: believe, and die no more.â Unchanged that voiceâand though not yet The dead sit up and speak, Answering its call; we gladlier rest Our darlings on earth's quiet breast, And our hearts feel they must not break. Far better they should sleep awhile Within the church's shade, Nor wake until new heaven, new earth, Meet for their new immortal birth For their abiding place be made, Than wander back to life, and lean On our frail love once more. 'Tis sweet, as year by year we lose Friends out of sight, in faith to muse How grows in Paradise our store. Then pass, ye mourners, cheerly on, Through prayer unto the tomb, Still, as ye watch life's falling leaf, Gathering from every loss and grief Hope of new spring and endless home. Then cheerly to your work again, With hearts new braced and set To run, untired, love's blessed race, As meet for those who face to face Over the grave their Lord have met. [THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS] âHe had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying.ââLuke viii. 42. Youthful maiden, beauty's flower, Opening for thy summer hour, Know there is a sadder death Than this one, of parting breath. First of all, in secret sins The undying worm begins; But when prayer is given o'er, Then the pulse doth beat no more; Next, when Faith in God's high will Ceases, then the breath is still. Soon Decay, with secret traces, All the work of God effaces; Yet awhile calm beauty lingers, E'en beneath Death's silent fingers; For the features still are fair, You might think that life was there. Now, before Corruption foul Makes his bed in that dark soul, Blest if love should thither lead Christ, the Raiser of the dead. Upon Him, with earnest call, Cast thyself, thine all in all Make Him; what though others scorn, Mock, and laugh, or o'er thee mourn, Life shall soon resume her seat, Thou with Him shalt rise and eat. [THE AGONY]. O Holy Lamb, slain ere the world was made, And hast Thou from Thy Father's bosom come, Thyself the Sacrifice Dimly shadow'd of old? [WASHING THE DISCIPLES FEET] Lord, why in this mysterious scene Art Thou thus kneeling low? Teach us what Thou by this dost mean That we should do or know. [THE BURIAL] One shall say unto Him, What are these wounds in Thine hands? Then shall He answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of My friends. Zech xiii. 6. Hush'd is the noise of that tremendous day In Gabbatha's dark hall and Calvary's hill; The dreadful sounds in distance die away, And in that rocky garden all is still. The Shepherd of the sheep there smitten lies; His sheep beloved are scatter'd far and wide; One faithful group stands in the evening skies, Beneath a rugged rock's o'erhanging side. Joseph and Nicodemus, now grown bold, There wrap their Lord in the white winding-sheet; With fragrant funeral honours they enfold His Head and Body and His sacred feet. The Holy Women too are gazing there, In sorrow beyond sorrow drawing nigh; But the sore agonies of their despair Are calm'd by the deep sense that God is nigh. Here Mary and Salome foremost stand, And gaze on that loved Face all mark'd with gore; The thorny crown hard by, and wounded Hand, Speak agonies which none hath known before. The Magdalene at feet of her dear Lord Kneels down, o'erwhelm'd with passionate grief profound, Remembers her anointing and His word, And gains an unknown comfort from each wound. The Virgin Mother of our Lord and God Is sitting by, in speechless woe, apart; They who approach Him most feel most the rod; The sword e'en now hath pierced her inmost heart. Christ risen. In majesty unspeakable He rose from the dark grave, Victorious o'er the powers of hell, Omnipotent to save. The soldier-guard that watched the tomb Lay breathless with affright, Their souls were wrapt with twofold gloom, While round them shone the light. Then came that holy company Of mourners ever blest, The sepulchre of death to see, But found an angel-guest. Why seek the Living 'mong the dead? No more the grave's dark prison Shall hold Him in her silent bed; The Lord of life is risen! [BEHOLD I STAND AT THE DOOR] âBEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR, AND KNOCK.â Rev. iii. 20. A Stranger in the morning light, Without the door He stood, His locks are wet with dews of night, Song of Solomon v. 2. His hair is drench'd with blood. Lord, art Thou still a stranger, then, By love and pity led, No place among the sons of men To lay Thy sacred Head? Thou bid'st us knock with earnest cries, And none on earth so poor But if he knocks, Thou wilt arise, And ope for him the door. Matt. vii. 7. Still Thou for us art listening long, To rise and let us in, We heed Thee not, we do Thee wrong, And stray in ways of sin: For all too well Thy spirit knows Short time doth yet remain Before the eternal door shall close, And we shall knock in vain. Luke xiii. 25. Thou waitest, but we do not hear; From Heaven Thou comest down; To us on earth Thou drawest near, Thy wandering sheep to own. Yea, Thou Thyself to us art come, And listening at the door, Seeking with us to make Thine home, And dwell for evermore. His locks are wet with dews of night, His hair is drenched with blood, And long within the morning light He at the door hath stood. Two men of old the risen Lord Once joined along the way, With burning hearts they heard His word, And urged with them to stay. Beneath their roof then Him they led, An unknown stranger-guest, When suddenly in breaking bread Their God was manifest. Luke xxiv. 31. 'Tis He that's called the Morning Star Who listeneth at thy door, Within His side there is a scar, His hands are mark'd with gore. If thou wilt ope the door e'en now, His pledge to thee is given; âThen I will sup with thee below, And thou with Me in Heaven.â Rev. iii. 20. A Stranger in the morning light Without the door He stood, His locks are wet with dews of night, His hair is drench'd with blood. The Guardian Angel. âTAKE HEED THAT YE DESPISE NOT ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES: FOR I SAY UNTO YOU, THAT IN HEAVEN THEIR ANGELS DO ALWAYS BEHOLD THE FACE OF MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN.â Child on the Plank. See those bubbles, one, two, three, How they sparkle! now they flee, Now they stop and look at me; Then they hide; now, three, four, five, Whirl about as if alive; Then they break; and then another Rises up, and wheels around, With that rippling, pleasant sound. But how little does my mother Think that I have strayed so far, Or what I have got for her! Guardian Angel. Gently tread, my little one! Fair and bright the waters run; But where most they seem asleep, There are whirlpools very deep; And you have no stay to hold On the plank so free and bold; And to save yourself, I know, You that flower would ne'er let go. The Child in the Storm. âFOR THEY SAY THAT LITTLE INFANTS REPLY BY SMILES AND SIGNS TO THE BAND OF GUARDIAN ANGELS THAT ROUND ABOUT THEM SHINES.â Dark the mountains are, and drear, And no human footstep near; 'Neath the shelter of my wing Safely sleep, thou helpless thing; For the storm that beats so wild Shall not harm thee, little child. From beyond the silver star Have I spied thee from afar; And have come, my watch to keep O'er thee smiling in thy sleep. Gently smile, my little one, For thou art not left alone; Happy would thy mother be Could she wisdom learn of theeâ 'Mid the tempest thus to smile, And to trust in God the while. He through the dark mountain-way Watches where her footsteps stray; But she is half dead with care, For she knows not He is there.</field>
