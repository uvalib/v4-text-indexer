      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HONOURABLE MRS. LEIGH, THE BELOVED SISTER OF OUR IMMORTAL POET, LORD BYRON, THE FOLLOWING HUMBLE PAGES Are Dedicated, BY HER VERY AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND RELATION, E. C. E. STUART WORTLEY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON THE ANCIENT BURIAL PLACE AT PISA. This originally formed part of a poem introduced into my âTravelling Sketches in Rhyme,â and which was published in an unfinished state. How deep a sanctity this grave-ground wears, Oh! what an over-burthening weight of years Rests on this solemn soil; oh! what a weight Of human interest and of human fate!â Trembling, my foot this drear enclosure nears, Yet start no warm, no quick, no natural tears, From my sad rivetted eyesâtoo dull and cold, Is all I here confrontâI here behold; I feel I cannot weepâcold, cold, and dim, The cup of death here filled up to the brim, The dark and rugged cup of death appears, And all too distant, yet too deep for tears; And shadowed, fixed, and frozen o'er by time, To something more mysteriously sublime, Something the mind can scarcely comprehend; Formless, vague, dim, abstractedâwithout end, Without beginningâsomething which the thought Recoils from, shuddering!âDeath, thou seem'st thus fraught With terrors not thine ownâa deeper shade Upon thy sombre semblance here is laid, With more of drear obscurity endowed, Thou lowerest roundâa cloud-encinctured cloud, New attributes of awe invest thee here, I gaze, I tremble, but I shed no tear! Death, Death! and can thy form of shadowy gloom, By Time's petrific sceptre touched, become More dim and icelike than before? Ah, why? Is Time not thy sworn friend, thine old ally, Thy zealous minister and faithful mate, The sure abettor still of thee and Fate. Time, who with thee still hand in hand hath gone, Making all bow before thy cloud-black throne; And if thy sharp stroke thou hast awhile forborne, And left bright hopes uncrushed, dear ties untorn,â And left awhile upon its stalk the rose, To blush and smile in its most sweet repose, Or the proud pine on its commanding heightâ Unhurt by buffeting storm or withering blight, Aye, if some favoured few thou hast thus passed o'er, And left to enjoy their happiness' bright store, Themselves unstricken by thy mortal dart, Nor wounded through some dearer kindred heart; He, blind as Justice' self, rough, rude, and hoar, Plucks them from their vain tenure evermore, And sweeps them one by one to thine embrace, Their doom fulfilled, and closed their lengthened race. The obsequious servantâand the officious friendâ Who biddeth all before thee cower and bend! Still over thee a shadow he hath thrown, Deeper, and yet more dismal than thine own! Yea! over thee a shadow he hath flung, Darker than all that erewhile round thee hung, Until the surcharged spirit inly saith, âThis is the very ghost of ghostly Death! The phantom's dreamy phantasm!â yet not less But more, doth it dispirit and oppress. Still, still 'tis strange, that Time should darkly spread Round thee a dreariment more stern and dread, Round thee, who in a moment changeth all Beneath thy withering touch and ruinous thrall, Who in one moment doth assert thy power, That hideous victory in one fleeting hourâ At once that conquest doth resistless gain, Which thou shalt ever unopposed maintain. Aye, and its ghastlier after-revel too, Dost thou with stern and savage zeal pursue, Ere oft, with smooth and measured movements true, Those hours have sped through their accustomed bounds, Those hours have run their oft-repeated rounds, Their courses never changed of day and night, Sustaining ever their harmonious flight! How seizest thou at once on thy marked prey, Converting them to worthless dust and clay, While the whole spirit is then at once expelled, And the whole frame in leaden durance held; Thus the dread change is direfully complete, And low thy victim crouches at thy feet. 'Tis done! the work of terror and dismay Look on the brow of one dead yesterday. 'Tis done! the work of horror and of woe, Nor can the tyrant's self that work undo, Nor can the tyrant's self that chain unwind With which each pulse he could so strictly bind. Look on the brow of one dead yesterday, How full, how sweeping is the conqueror's sway; How wide, how perfect is the drear divorce, Clay! to thy clod! free spirit! to thy source. A thousand barriers seem at once to rise, (Where e'er we turn our foiled and baffled eyes) Betwixt the quick and dead!âyea, dread and deep, Rise those huge barriers between those that sleep, And those that still must watch, and still must wake, And toil and travail, and brief respite take, Save when a slumber, not so deep nor sweet, After the day's harsh tumult and fierce heat, Comes to refresh their taxed and failing powers, To enable them to bear the weight of hours, The weight of feverish human hours again, With all their tedium, and with all their pain. Oh! stern and strong those frowning barriers are, And none may lift the intermediate bar, And none the intervenient pit may leap, While life is theirsâthat gloomy pit, and deep, Which yawns, the living and the dead betwixt; Howe'er before their very souls were mixed In love or sympathy, or interest keen, As though nought, nought could e'er be forced between! 'Tis done!âand they are sundered wide and far, Dead! to your rest! ye living! to the war! For what, indeed, is vexed and troublous life But one long conflictâone protracted strife? Look on the face of one dead yesterday, Alas! of sense, of consciousness no ray Doth there remain, that blank so dull and drear, To fill, or even to make less harsh appear, Far, far beyond our searching glance and thought, Hath flown the spirit, then all vainly sought, And what we look on, is, and can be, nought. Yea, far that spirit is removed from earth, As though it ne'er had known a mortal birth. No ages can increase the vast gulph spread, Between the soul to its new mansions sped, And this low little world where once it dwelt, And hoped, and dreamt, and knew, and proved, and felt. No centuries can that yawning chasm extend, Nor stretch the abyss that hath nor bounds nor end; No chances and no change that may betide Can make that separation yawn more wide; No! when the soul hath gained its long release, No time that dread partition can increase, Nor e'er estrange the exiled being more, From earth's forsaken and forgotten shore, Than he is utterly and all estranged, Soon as for Death's dim realm this earth's exchanged; Nor shall a heavier interdict e'er sound, To bar from all communion with this groundâ This mortal ground, of old so freely trod, Ere the changed frame was laid beneath the sod, Than was pronounced, when first the soul took flight, What time the armed spectre sternly stooped to smite, What time were closed the dimmed and clouded eyes, 'Gainst all fair Nature owns, and Heaven supplies; Nor can the spirit be more lost to us Than 'twas immeasurably then and thus. Never may it more utterly be lost Than 'twas when first the fatal bridge it crossed, Lost unto us, to time, and to the world; Even in a brief and breathless moment hurled From all that it had ever loved or known, To be the Great Eternity's alone! The soil, heaped crumbling for a thousand years, Above the mournful freight earth's bosom bears, In stern selected spots of funeral gloom, Drear, sombre, solemn privacies of the tomb, Can ne'er a veil more frowning interpose 'Twixt us who breathe this free, fresh air, and those Who are laid beneath in their deep dreamless rest, (Like sleeping children cradled in her breast), Than doth the fresh-strewn mould just press'd upon Some all forgetful and unconscious one, Whose earthly race is newly closed and done; Where, brown and bare, the kindred earth appears, Nor aught of borrowed beauty smiling wears; By shadowing grass and wild flowers unadorned, Blank as the clay the winged soul hath scorn'd, The clay that mingleth a few feet below, With those dull clods, in union chill and slow. No, noâthat loosely-heaped and fresh-strewn mould, Doth all as close and rigidly enfold The imprison'd sleeper in its darksome bed, Left to the eternal silence of the dead, As doth the o'ergrown soil for ages laid Above the reliques that have there decayed; As sternly doth it round its captive throw A funeral mystery none may pierce below, And yetâyetâwhile we walk 'mongst recent tombs, A more familiar guise the grave assumes; Death's awful presence there we recognize, Nor shudderingly avert our conscious eyes, Nor turn with faint and faultering step aside, As though a mournful voice within us cried, âInvade not the pale realms so long consigned To the stern conqueror of all humankind!â 'Tis different all!âthat consecrated ground Where swells full many a lately fashioned mound, Scarce seems all his dominion!âhe must share His reign with other Powers and Rulers there. The Angel and Genius of bright life appears To hover round that place of unstaunched tears; And by that dread companion, yet unscared, To keep o'er every grave a watchful guard; And thus thy form, thou stern and terrible Death, Seems almost shrouded and concealed beneath A thousand linked associations sweet, And freshly-twined remembrances, that cheat The hard reality of half its gloom, And throw a living beauty round the tomb! The spot calls forth a thousand tender dreams, Illusions soft, and visions blest, whose gleams O'er all around a smiling lustre cast, And mediate 'twixt the present and the past. Of its most dreary shades the scene's deprived; Amidst the dead we feelâbut that they lived; We picture to ourselves what once they were, How strong, how brave, how noble, or how fair; How full of human feelings, human hopes, Though now assembled in such passive groupes; And how alive to all that passed around, Though now in apathy so frozen bound. Their namesâsweet sounds!âfamiliar to our ears, Which, haply, old aoquaintanceship endearsâ Their names in characters all uneffaced, On their smooth tombstones are distinctly traced; Their children move with soft steps round their graves, And many a tear the mournful hillock laves; The sheltering tree that late waved o'er their heads, Still to the breeze its mighty foliage spreads; The bower they fondly trimmed with careful hands, Still in its frail fantastic beauty stands; The hawthorn-sweetened way they ofttimes trod, Still breathes its rustic incense far abroad; Almost their very footsteps we might find, While they are gone, like clouds seized by the wind, And carried wildly, utterly awayâ Whither no heart can dream, nor tongue can say. Yet something doth it soothe the pensive soul To pore o'er Memory's deeply-written scroll, To dwell upon the thoughts of what hath been, And from the past's tried, trodden field to glean Pale scattered treasures, which faint-glistening seem, Like aÃ«ry fragments of some broken dreamâ Still, scarcely so; for, while we muse, we feel It is the Truth that thus doth softening steal Along the chastened and uplifted mind, By tender feeling hallowed and refined; And ever as we lingering brood and muse, That Truth arrays itself in deepening hues; That which hath been distinctly reappears, Delivered from the yoke of breathless years. Oh, Time! how dealest thou with all mortal things, Shaking them off like dewdrops from thy wings, Scoffer and fearful spoiler that thou art!â And yet we open spread the burning heart Unto thy ruthless stroke, and rashly load Those wings with our soul's treasures, that o'erflowed As they would flood the Eternityâto be Ruined, undone, and overborne by thee! But then our souls revenge themselves, and cast Their own sweet light upon the o'ershadowed past; And Memory, with her magic, magic wand, Strikes down the blunted scythe from thy foiled hand. We feed on recollections, until nought But what is past seems present to our thought; The tomb's pale prisoners burst their leaden bands; For them afresh flow the hour's exhausted sands; They are, once moreâstill growing on our souls, We feel the cloud of death its gloom unrolls, And the wan forms it veiled from our vain gaze, On every side slow-opening, it displays. These haunt us in full many a startling guise, Passingârepassingâoft before our eyes; These haunt us still where'er we turn and tread, The strongâthe mightyâyea, the immortal dead! We feel their being so withinâwithout, 'Tis but of their unbeing we can doubt! We see the gorgeous universe they saw, Fulfilling still each bright eternal law; Still in perfection's radiant robe arrayed, Unwithered, undespoiled, and undecayed, The universe of which they formed a part. And doth not something whisper at the heart They are not, and they cannot be destroyed, Since thus they leave no shadow, cause no void? How perfect, how complete seems all around, And are they vanished to be no more found? Yet not one ray the less, one cloud the more, To mourn that they are exiles from life's shore; That they are silent prisoners of the past, Fallen on annihilation's void at last; They, whose quick thoughts were Form, Light, Life, Time, Space, Since each they could reflect, and all embrace;â Whose thoughts out-lightened the winged lightnings sent In fierce resplendence from the firmament; Transpierced dense matter, marked creation's laws, And traced back that Creation to its Cause! And can the Life, the Thought, the Breath, the Heart, Unmissed, unmourned, thus ignobly depart? Dream it notâfear it not! it cannot be, 'Twere, oh! too terrible a mystery. Look in the face of yon transcendant sun; Age after age his proud race he hath run In undiminished strength and light, and seen Myriads borne down to dust, himself serene As when he first commenced his bright career, The lord of light and life, the central sphere, The chief of worlds, the monarch of the year! Look on the empurpled heavens, the irradiate earth, All beauteous as at their first splendid birth, And think ye such a glory can have past Still Life by Life, away from these, nor cast A sad and sombre tint o'er all around? That sun, that sky, the sea, the air, the groundâ A heavy cloud of change o'er theseâo'er all A something like the spreading of a pall, By slow but sure degreesâno pause betweenâ O'er the whole boundless, Universal Scene, While victory after victory swept to exalt That conqueror's march who never knows to halt! Aye! if the bonds were rent for evermore, That linked her children to her breast before, Would no fond pang be felt at nature's core? No mournful faintness overspread her face, And shadow o'er her glory and her grace? If 'twere for ever they were snatched away, Would not victorious Death, and strong Decay Their cloudy banners haughtily display, And with imperious exultation wave, O'er this chill worldâone death-bed and one grave? Yea! their dark banners gloryingly unfold, And tell the suns and stars that they were old; And bid them shake before those boding tones Even on the pillared firmness of their thrones,â Still, step by step, advancingâhour by hourâ From strength to strengthâfrom sovereign power to powerâ Would not those dread and giant Terrors sweep All, all before them to destruction's deep? What! shall the Sense, the Feeling, and the Will Be the chief spoilâthe chosen victim still? The wond'rous faculties of the ardent mind, Free as the light, and strong as the unchained wind, Be at one stroke extinguished and suppressed, And all the quick thoughts which that mind confessedâ One moment all seemed theirsâsay, dispossessed, Even of the clay that clothed them, are they hurled For ever from a proud surviving world? For ever are they crushed and trampled down, No place, no power, no will, no way their own? Fear it notâdream it not, it may not be; 'Tis Reason's grand impossibility! Learn nobler things of earth, and sky, and air, Read brighter, purer, prouder meanings there. Doth not that sky, that air, that eloquent earth, Startle the soul to thoughts of loftier birth? Doth not their fair, harmonious show dispense A happier and a holier confidence? Surely, in their perfection's strength, they know That it may not beâthat it is not so! They know that 'tis not so, while we, hedged round With sorrow and with sin, and strictly bound By chains, which earth's lost habitants have rent With doubts, and fears, and hopes together blent, Too oft go trembling on our clouded way, And close our eyes on the uncreated day: The light that all creation's frame pervadesâ The light that never setsâthat never fadesâ Shall that not pierce dim human nature's shades? Surely they know it is not so! and own, Even like a living mantle round them thrown, A Presenceâand a Passionâand a Power! Since, gorgeous universe! the all regal dower, Say, art thou not of those crowned spirits freed, That snatch at last the palmâthe wreathâthe meedâ That burst at last from their restraining bars, To o'erflow with added light the immortal stars; With added fire and light the imperious sun Glorying his lone, proud, central throne upon; And to suffuse the ether and the air With subtlest powers, pure, exquisite, and rare; To impregnate the elements, and all that is With their own essenceâtrebly blessed through this! Thus they rejoin Creation's mighty wholeâ The Pulse of nature, and of space the Soul! A Motionâand a Feelingâand a Willâ And shall not many a quick, responsive thrill, Deep quivering through that tranced creation go; Oh! who shall rashly say it is not so? Shall not an instinct of rich consciousness The universal system kindling bless? Shall not a glorious sympathy intenseâ A strong vibrationâan electric senseâ An answering impulseâan accordant glowâ A deep, reciprocating feeling's flow Be felt through all the Almighty Maker's works, Where many a hidden power unrecked-of lurks? And most, where most at their mysterious springs Quicken the eternal energies of things? There most that consciousness shall pierce, inform, There most inspire, control, illume, and warm, Till all shall wake, glow, breathe, and live, and move, In one existence of unbounded love! One mighty and transcendant unity, That shall eternal as consummate be; One wond'rous harmony, that still shall spread.â Oh! what are they whom we miscall the dead? Who that hath lost a tried and trusted friend, With whose deep soul his own rejoiced to blend In free communion, hallowed and refined, Spirit with spirit linked, and mind with mind; Who that remembers the intercourse of hearts, The soul's sublime escapes and thrilling starts, As to the electric touch of some charmed wand Waved by a mighty, though a viewless, hand; When some chance word, some accidental tone, Pierced through its depths and bade it, kindling, own A thousand splendid sympathies august, That nought in common have with earth and dust; And to strong, eloquent life its silence woke, As by the quick shock of a lightning-stroke! The spirit's wild upspringings and keen flights, And pinings for its liberties and rights; The yearnings for a life more proud and free, The hungerings after immortality, Which, in so many and such various ways, Man's restless nature evermore displays. Who, that remembers this, can turn away From strong conviction, open as the day? Oh! who, remembering thus, in friendship's hours Of confidential breathings (when to ours Another's heart was clearly open laid, With all its wond'rous change of light and shade), How strong the impassioned aspirations were For a more cloudless sky, a purer air; How keen the questionings after secret things; How great the impulse to spread forth its wings, And bid the liberated spirit soar To those empyreal heights ne'er scaled before! How deep the love in the aching bosom set, For those far realms, unreached, unviewed, as yet, Can for one moment hesitate to own, That truth so glorious, so distinctly shown. Or who that recollects the living look, (With all the immixed expressions which it took,) Of one once bound to him by slighter ties, Yet dear and hallowed in his softened eyes; Of one o'er whom the dense veil now is cast, For whom all things of earth are sealed and past; Of one now banished from the light and air, And darkly pent, and coldly prisoned there! Who that remembers, too, that voice that seemed The soul's best vehicle, the voice that teemed With ever-varying modulations still, Whether the speaker's soul was moved by ill Or cheered by goodâthe voice of one now dumb, Now speechless, 'mid the loud incessant hum; (The unpausing din that echoeth not the less Because they are fallen on silent nothingness;) The thousand bright outbreakings of the soul, That undesignedly bared to us the whole, With its deep secrets and mysterious springs, Its strange anomalies and wond'rous things, Its gorgeous treasuries and exhaustless mines, And shadowed sanctuaries, and dim-veiled shrines (Yet, no!ânot so!âof that deep human soul No living eye hath yet embraced the whole; Nor even can friendship's hand that veil upraise, Which guards the inner being from the gaze; That mighty veil o'er each existence thrown, Each, each its own deep worldâapartâalone. Still those outbreakings, those unmaskings, told Full many a thought and feelingâfold in fold, That lay before religiously concealed, As though on earth they might not be revealed.) Who, that remembers these, can fail to feel, Though worldly, vain pursuits may stain or steel, Though worldly prejudice may bar and blind, Or worldly sin with cramping chains may bind, That the deep soul that there in might o'erflowed, That there in all its native vigour glowed, Can never alter and can never die? The child and heir of all eternity! Nay! who that looks back on his own past years, While slow the shadowy prospect spreads and clears, While Memory's soft pathetic light is cast O'er the pale scenery of the buried past; Who, that remembers the endless thoughts and dreams That have illumed his spirit with their gleams, The strange, mysterious, deep impressions there, From time to time, stamped strongly, full, and fair; That spirit's bright expectancies and hopes, Its vigorous zeal that with Fate's harshness copes; Its heavenly foretastes of a suture state, Which it springs forward to anticipate; Its fervent yearnings for its own far home, Which, ever and anon, will startling come, Strange as the fairy melodies that dwell In the echoing windings of the ocean shell, So spiritually delicate and clear, We almost seem to feel them, more than hear. Yet, oh! how deeply do they, murmuring, tell Those magic sounds in the ocean's haunted shell, Sweet tidings of their far off place of birthâ That surgy moanâno! 'tis not of the earth; And still they breathe their long eternal sigh, Sad as a breaking harp-string's plaintive cry! Even so those promptings and those prophet tones Which the pierced bosom tremulously owns, Seem in one farthest heart of hearts enshrined, Of our blest native regions to remind. Who, that remembers these, can thrust aside That heavenly hope, with all that's bright alliedâ Can for one instant deign or dare to doubt, That truth impressed within, inscribed without, Inscribed in radiant characters sublime, O'er all the shadowy things of earth and time, In fulgent characters of living light, More clearly traced than stars on blackest night. Thou ancient, stern, and solemn burial-place, Where sleep in peace a long-forgotten race, Like waves that ran their bright, brief course of yore, And broke and melted on the lonely shore. Like leaves that the autumns of the pale Past shed Upon their silent and discoloured bed; Like clouds that long since from Heaven's marbled face Have passed away, to leave no shadowy trace; Like sparks trod out on hearths of other days, Where now no light, no quick flame flickering plays; Thou stern and solemn burial place of old, Where rest in their securest, firmest hold, The silent, shrouded dead, of ages dead! Like them with mantling shadows overspreadâ Like them for ever lost, for ever fled! Thou canst no sweet, consoling visions bring To bid bright Hope from faint Dejection spring. No! when a friend's dear head is low-laid near, Love, mighty love, is strong to banish fear. In thought we follow to a happier sphereâ In thought we then in distant regions meet, And track the soul to its august retreat; We feel the light we saw in that loved eye Was not created to decayâor die; Nay! even if those, stretched near in their cold trance, Had crossed our paths from time to time, perchance; From time to time, as through life's walks we ranged, With us had greetings and kind words exchanged; Their well-remembered aspects rise once more Our thoughtful-lingering, faint-drooped eyes before! And can we call to mind each buried face, Without remembering that deep eloquent trace Which the immaterial and the undying part Stamped on the features, as the skill of art Stamps on the unmeaning canvas glorious forms, Until it breathes, wakes, smiles, speaks, glows, and warms! The soul's own sun-like image there forget? Or not forgetting, deem it e'er could set? No, surely no; the homeliest features wear An impress of the spirit glowing there; The living rays are brightly streaming seen To light the least inspired, least thoughtful mien,â And o'er the unloveliest lineaments to throw A something that naught else can match below; Aye! something is stamped there which claims at once From kindred conscious natures deep response; Something is there the eagle's eye must lack, Though it hath flashed in glorious daring back The sun's fierce, sultry lustre, when at noon He seemed as he would fire Heaven's red depths soon, Superbly scattering forth in kingly pride His royal treasures, free, and full, and wide; Something the lion's lordly front ne'er bore, Though armed with awful terrors evermore; Though the wild creatures of the forest fly Before the tyrannous threatenings of his eyeâ Though not the boldest of them dare to brook The glorious savage's life-withering look; Something with still, small voice, that startling saith, âI amâand I am ne'er to stoop to death.â The mighty ray of immortality Gleams proudly forth from the least lustrous eye! While some, oh! some rare aspects brightly shine With angel-graces radiant and divine, And the everlastingness of the unseen soul Seems stamped thereon, as on a glowing scroll, Where every lookâthe least and lightest glanceâ The very stillness of the countenance Bear a triumphant meaning, clear and deep, From whence we may the august assurance reap! That countenance illumined from within, Seems but a light, transparent veil, and thin, Between us and the immortal soul that lies Deep in its shrine, one world of mysteriesâ Deep in its living shrine, yet softly shown, And by no light, no lustre but its own, Unto the kindred mind even thus made known. Aye! some transcendant countenances seem, While with expression's radiant prints they teem, All music, inspiration, light, and fire, And like the fuming of an incense-pyre, Scattering its subtle treasures far and wide, Its delicate luxuries free on every side; These seem to exhale a glorious effluence Of pure and exquisite intelligence; Celestial emanations quickening flow From the lit eye, wreathed lip, and flashing brow; While glows the cheek with many a varying hue, As though you saw how the eloquent soul wrought through; As though the quick thoughts ever as they past Across the aspect, keen and kindling cast Their burning shadows there, full, free, and fast! As though from those flushed shadows still more bright, And all transpierced with the inward-streaming light, The living tablet of the human face, Stamped with full many a clear and radiant trace, Was as some lighted vase, through which we see The flame's winged motions wavering swift and free; Some alabaster vase of delicate mould, Designed the glittering, quivering lamp to hold; The lamp whose every flash there sostened plays, No crest of wild-wreathed spires and scattered rays, That break in many a luminous streak, and part,â And with a meteor-brilliance wildering dart, And stream,âand shoot,âand shiftâan hundred ways, But one smooth, undulating, mellowed blaze. Thus, thus the etherial and effulgent mind Within its living casket deep enshrined, Shines clear unto the rapt beholder's view, The lighted features brightly-kindling through, Still to its strong, triumphant influence true; The many-coloured thoughts that quickening dart Along the mind, we may not mark apart; Not as within the ever-coining brain, In bright succession and luxuriant train, They take their glowing and their winged way, And in a thousand strange, wild flickerings play; But as they are gathered, mingled, massed, combined, In one fine finished harmony of mindâ One glorious unity, so perfect seems That delicate confluence of those countless beams, Which through the impressive aspect startling streams; While breathes, and breaks, and brightens thro' the whole A hueâa lightâa motion of the soul! But these that now around me silent dwell, The clayey captives of the clayey cellâ But these, their eyes ne'er answered back our own, Our ears ne'er drank their accent's varying tone; We never marked the soul's own glorious trace, In bright suffusions trembling o'er their face. We never saw the immortal meanings rise, Fraught with rich confirmation in their eyes! These are the strangers of a severed age, Their history is for us a close-sealed page; Their children's children are like them inurned, Like them have to the embodying dust returned! Haply with age weighed down into the grave, Whose peaceful shelter they were fain to crave; Our fathers' fathers looked not on their face, For them they were a past forgotten race! For them they were a people of the tomb, Nor knew they of them but their common doom. Our children's children in the times to come, Shall not be more estranged than we are now, From these long swept, like dew-drops, from the bough. Therefore my mind, from sympathy withdrawn, Contemplates this deep scene, till slowly dawn Clearer reflections on its struggling sense, And springs a happier, tenderer mood from thence. And gradually unfolding, come again Familiar images to heart and brain, (Though by that heart and brain shaped, moulded, coined!) With human sensibilities conjoined, And influences more gracious and more kind, With soft controul prevail o'er my soothed mind. Unto my quickened sense and deepened sight The estranged from earth rise imaged forth aright; Reason resumes her reignâI feel, I know, These bore their measured share of bliss and woe, The curious, complex, countless links and ties, With deep emotions then I recognize, Which bind, while ages their stern task fulfil, To generationâgeneration still! These deep traits too which time can ne'er efface, Which reconcile the past and present race! Ah! me! how lost to every feeling now, That stamps humanity's ingenuous brow, That thrills humanity's capacious heart, That bids young smiles to shine, quick tears to start, Are these cold slumberers, laid our feet beneath, In all the still unconsciousness of death; Though once, ere smitten by fate's envious blow, Once, ere consigned to hungering worms below; Though once, ere exiled to death's cheerless clime, The paths, the various paths of good and crime, They surely followed, and though once within Their breasts glowed quick emotions, we can win But little from these monuments to expose, But little from these carved tombs to disclose, Their deeds, their dooms, their aims, their joys, and woes! And what but these dumb monuments remain, To say they breathed, who ne'er must breathe again; What but these tombs, these sepulchres are found, To speak of them in earthy durance bound; And of their death most, most, these speak and tell, Most on that fearful consummation dwell! And there 'tis made the chief, great, one event, O'er all besides, how sternly prominent! Thou mightiest Death! thou here remainest alone, Conspicuous, on thine isolated throne! Robed in the lengthened shadows of thy reign, Attended but by thine own spectral train; Girt proudly round with all thy state, that suits Thy sombre emblems, and stern attributes. Thou dwell'st here a palmed victor 'midst thy spoils, While from thy contact the chill'd heart recoils; Thou makest thyself a tyrant monarch here, And rulest through prostrate awe and palsied fear; Thou pullest down the pride of glorying life, With its vain triumphs and tempestuous strife, And makest it own itself a fleeting breath, Before thy conquering might, thou mastering Death! Thou seizest on its proud and daring hope, And bidd'st it sickening wane and withering droop, In harsh reprisals for the fiery scorn, With which it joyed to paint thee still as shorn Of each redeeming attribute of good, Traduced, avoided, and misunderstood! With which it sought thy memory still to erase From each blessed haunt, each loved abiding place, And still to wipe away thine every trace, And to despoil thee of thy rightful share, In all that chains men's thoughts, and claims men's care; In harsh reprisals for the old disrespect, The indignities, dishonour, and neglect, To which thou'rt here exposed for evermore, Where haughty life thus triumphs, passing o'er Thy triumphs stern, oft spread her eyes before! These long-bound tenants of the tomb, sleep well, Earth's noisy strife ne'er shakes them in their cell; And, oh! how long their slumber hath endured, How long have they thus strictly been immured; The race of beings that they left behind, Are gone, like whirling dust upon the wind; The hands that laid their reliques in this spot, Long since their strength and cunning have forgot; The tears that mourned them long since have been dried, And those that wailed their deaths themselves have died, Mourner and mourned here slumber side by side. Lo! of their hues of life all disarrayed, The beautiful, the valourous here are laid Beneath our feet, their beauty is effaced, Their valour tamed and crushed, and all that graced Or glorified their past existence, seems Gone, like that froth of nothingnessâour dreams; So far removed from our regards are they, So far removed, so darkly rapt away, That scarce can we our doubting minds persuade, That once in mortal lineaments arrayed, They moved alongâno shadows of a shade, No bodiless dreamsâno imaged things ideal, But living glowing forms, substantial, real; No visionary phantoms, thin as air, That momently appeared, then melted there; But beings full of energies and hope, Strong, strong with all, save one brief pang to cope! And unto us while thus we muse and gaze, And vainly strive oblivion's pall to raise, Even of another different world unknown, Appear to have been those parted ones and flown; Yea, of some different world to ours, they seem To have been the denizens, we scarce can deem They once were, as ourselvesâmost futile dream! It is not so! all that we are, they were, The Votaries of the self-same hope and care, The Followers of the same unwise pursuits, From whence they reaped like rough and bitter fruits. The Apostles of the same unheavenly creeds, (For they, like us, leant still on faithless reeds), That by example, practice, works, and deeds, Too, too persuasive preaching, to their way Haply won heedless converts, drawn astrayâ The Adorers of the same vain idols too; For what beneath the unvarying sun is new? The Pilgrims of the same dull beaten road, Bent, fainting bent, beneath the same harsh load; That our bruised shoulders long o'er burthened bear The crushing load of sufferings and of care! The tired Performers on the same cramped stage, The sad Possessors, too, from youth to age, Still of the same dark dangerous heritage. The struggling Prisoners of the same vile clay, Pressed down to earth, as we are pressed to-day, Subject to all the evils, trials, pains, Which fetter us in close and galling chains; The tasked Probationers, through wrong and strife, Even of the same proud everlasting life! And would we look on them indeed, and know The secrets of their sojourn here below, The counsels of their breasts, we must begin, By gazing unreservedly withinâ By lifting from our souls the covering veil, And not disguising what is false and frail; What wild and wayward in ourselves concealed, Then much that was suppressed, shall be revealed; Then shall we firmlier grasp, and clearer guess, Far less confusing, and mistaking less, Those truths that seemed before our search to evade, Lost in a labyrinth of cloud and shade. No florid flatteries carved on sculptured stone, No heart-felt tributes, in affection's tone Couched fondly, on the monumental urn, That might even touch the cold and melt the stern; No close details, no wrought descriptions long, Where mingleth false with real, and right with wrong; No pompous titles, spread in haughty style, Graved on the funeral slab, the trophy pile; No ostentatious blazonries embossed On deep-dyed banners that had once been tossed, By stormy winds, on battle's stirring plain, Then mouldering hung o'er mouldering bones in vain, With dust and cobwebs on each trailing fold, With clouded broideries thick, and tarnished gold, Can so discover, so betray, and show The mysteries of their pilgrimage below, As our own opened, probed, stripped, sounded breasts, Where all life's feelings are by turns the guests, As our own naked and dissected hearts Their mirrors, shadows, nay, their counterparts; For almost thus do they become at last, When through life's various trials they have past. Tinged to one colour, to one level brought, Tuned to one key, and to one texture wrought; Ruled by one law, and by one influence swayed, And in one mould impressed, one balance weighed! Oh! uniform our various natures grow, Through life's too equalizing care and woe; Aye, even in differing we resemble still, As leaves that on the verdurous branches thrill; Whose very veins and lines, that may to the eye Of keen research, prove strange diversity, Unto the common gaze but make appear Their strong similitude more close and clear, Their strict conformity more nice and near. Their Counterparts, their Histories, too, are there, Just chronicle, and copy, close and fair. Lo! to have loved, lost, struggled, failed, and drooped, Rallied, resisted, dreamed, dared, trusted, hoped; To have essayed, and laboured, and endured; To have been crossed, discouraged, reassured, Chastened and tried, and shaken and subdued; By hope misguided, by regrets pursued. Is't not the Universal History, say, The rapid summary of life's little dayâ The general record of the sons of clay? Their History is, indeed, in our own hearts, That ape their passions, and that act their parts; Chapter for chapter oft alike are found, Column for column, as the web's unwoundâ Character even for character might there Be ofttimes traced, if marked with watchful care. And, blazoned on the same dark treacherous ground, Deepâshadowyâcloudedâstretching without boundâ That ground of passions, feelings, frailties, dreams, Where gleam out fond designs and cherished schemes, (That still are meant unfailingly to lead To radiant happiness, the all-worshipped meed), That oft, too oft, in blank confusion end. While dark Reality doth scowling rend The veil from Fancy, and the wreath from Hope, To bid the strong mind quail, the quick heart droop; While Disappointment's harsh and angry train Comes to distract the thought and cloud the brain; Sharp discontents, regrets, and gnawing cares, And sick despondencies and stern despairs, And all varieties of chill disgustsâ For this the vain head plots, the fond heart trusts; For this our restless spirits we consume, And banish from our cheeks youth's healthful bloom. Still looking forward, forward, as though nought But what were far were worthy to be sought; The future 'tis that must each wish fulfilâ Oh! could we look a little farther still! Beyond life's tangled webâits restless wave, And rest our eyes and hopes upon the grave! This historyâstill repeatedâstill renewed, Is theirsâis oursâis man's at once reviewed; Mortality's brief tales are trite and poor, Their course the same, and their conclusions sure; And modelled in the same terrestrial mould As those that suffered and succumbed of old; Outline for outline oft, and trait for trait, Feature for feature, we belike display Unconsciously to others and ourselves; For deep the pit that black Oblivion delves, Wherein the nations of the past remain, Though thus they rise up in their heirs again. Another Resurrection than the one Which waits them when the course of Time is doneâ A Resurrection to the stirâthe strifeâ The strangely-mingling Heaven-and-Hell of life! But happily for them, unfelt, unknown, Their pangs are ours, their peace all, all their own; We bear their cross, we struggle with their chain, While theyâthey have forgotten toil and pain! The deeper lineaments, broad, clear, and strong, In greater or in less degree belong To all that think and feel, to all that live, And with the bondage and the burthen strive. Doth not the phantom-demon, rampant Pride, In every bosom in some shape reside? What e'er the name it takes, the line it tries, What e'er its revelation or disguise; And still the love of power and love of praise Break forth in thousand forms, in thousand ways; Though smothered long, or disappointed oft,â It is our nature's bent to soar aloft! And still the eternal passion, love, is found In every living bosom's throbbing bound; Whether it be that vain, weak, worldlier love, Too many a breast doth lightly, poorly prove, Dyed with the rainbow, built upon the sands, Which scarce its object's happiness demands; But narrowed, lowered, still in its petty scope, Fostered by Vanity and fed by Hope, Begins and ends in Selfâin self alone, In sooth, the truest idol it hath known! Or that deep passion, raised, sublimed, refined, The love of heart and brain, and soul and mind, That standing like the Sun sees all around, In its own chains of burning glory bound, With its own luminous tendrils wreathed and wound; That may not know what 'tis to change or cease, The law of whose bright Being is increase; Still pouring forth its riches and its might, Until it floods the universe with light, By its own radiant gifts more glorious made! Throned amidst living, glowing worlds, arrayed In love, and light, and beautyâworlds that cast A lustre round where else had frowned a waste, And throw redoubled pomp of splendours o'er Their glory's heavenly source, so bright before! All-powerful passion! thus thou shedd'st around Thy soulâthy selfâthine essence without bound; And all by thee is girt, and lit, and crowned; Thou givest for ever from thy boundless store, And ever as thou givest receivest more! Oh! if aright their records we would read, No distant paths must we divergent tread. Nor let our judgment promptâour fancies lead; Their Histories are our Hearts!âeach pulse that beats, Some portion of their Annals still repeats, Some fragment of their Story doth unfold, Till throb by throb the whole strange tale is told! The fevered burning, and the withering chill, The aching, and the yearning, and the thrill; The rich o'erflowing, and the yawning void, The ecstatic senseâbut waked to be destroyed; Theseâthese nowâoh! too poignantly our own, In all their shades and stages they have known! No pangâno glow, can reach the bosom's core, That they have felt not thrillingly before; No joy uncheckedâno ill unsoothed, uncured, That they have not experienced and endured! And met too, haply, in the self-same way As we have metâas we do meetâto-day; For strong similitudes connect our clay. Howe'er we boast, while 'mid Life's wastes we pine, That we chalk out our course and choose our line; Or that to different fortunes we were born, And differently from them rejoice, or mourn; From themâlong since from Earth's oppressive chain Delivered, ne'er to know its weight again. Not in this worldâthis narrow spaceânot hereâ Not on this worn, dull, unelastic sphere, Can aught original and new appear; Alike our Nature's tendency and tone, And all seem shaped and modelled after one. Alike, the settled aspect and the hue (Unto the unprejudiced, impartial view) Of different passions and of various moods, O'er which the eye of Contemplation broods; And like to birds let loose in stranger woods, That soon grow practised and experienced there, And soar, and flock, and perch, and build, and pair, And trim the plume, and trill the unstudied chaunt; Choose their frequented bough, their favourite haunt; Skim the clear pool, and pierce the embowering shades, While every memory of their birth-place fades, And with their feathered brethren play their part, And, bold and buoyant, through the bright air dart As though they recked not of that alien air, And all things unaccustomed, strange, and rare. Even thus Earth's practised denizens we grow, And hold our way with all the rest below. Too soon do we initiated become In all the mysteries of our mortal home; Too soon, too soon familiarised with all The sinful thoughts man frameth since his fall, And no exceptionsâno exemptions start In proud relief, distinguished and apart From Life's dense massâbut all on this earth bend Beneath stern influences, that chill descend Upon this fated and o'ershadowed sphere, (Which yet well-known, familiar things endear), And with unconscious watchfulness minute, Our conduct we to other's conduct suit; While still we boast with exultation proud, We walk not with the millionâwith the crowd! And ofttimes dream, with self-complacent glow, We lead the way, and the example show. Oh! with the same temptations, trials, pains, The same hopes, wants, trusts, duties, blessings, banes, And with one end, one quest, one doom, one aim, Humanity's another, and the same! Well may this spot charm down to silent rest The myriad feelings battling in the breast, And even withdraw us from our worldly bliss, If bliss be oursâor that which more than this Chokes up the soul with earth's drossâits pursuit, That oft yields bitterest ashesâ'stead of fruit! Here, for one calm hour, it is well to stayâ To museâto moralizeâto adoreâto pray, Until we feel uplifted for awhile From Earth's vain care, and strife, and gloom, and toil, And from its atmosphere of trouble borne, Mount as upon the rushing wings of morn. Such hour should teach sage lessons, strong and deep, Yet every thought in peace religious steep, And show the vanity of earthly things, And stir the feelings in their inmost springs, And loosen, too, the thousand thread-like ties That bind to earthâwhile Timeâfor everâflies! Such hour might seem a touchstone of the past, And Truth's own colours o'er its surface cast, And make us prize alone those joys that last; Those real and solid joys that know no end; Whose memories pure, with heavenly hopes may blend! Nor should it teach ennobling truths alone, But make the soul their bright attractions ownâ But make the soul even rapturously confess, That they alone can lead to happiness! These lessons are the loftiest we can learn, And dull or rash are they who slight or spurn. And yet, however forcible and true, Such lessons may beâthey're nor rare nor new. Have we not met them oftentimes before, And carelessly glanced o'er the sacred lore? Each dayâeach hour that passes should proclaim, And dothâwould we but deign to attendâthe same. Each dayâeach hour that hurrieth o'er our head, As on some great momentous message sped, While still by sure degrees we're onwards led, Minute by minute, nearer to our tomb, While all things join to warn us of our doom. The evanished cloudâthe exhausted, ebbing breeze, That moans in dying cadence through the trees; The evaporating dropâthe extinguished flame, The shattered mirror in its fractured frame; The scorched grass of the fieldâthe harp's riven string, In Nature and in Art, each several thing Still speaks, with startling voiceâof perishing! And as we onwards on our progress wend, Still all things ending, mind us of our end. All that we love or prize, or seek or share, All that we know, view, meet, trust, claim, or bear, Still, still reminds us of the mighty change, As though our thoughts from human things to estrange, Still bears the impress of the great decay, Which wide extends the terrors of its sway. You need not quicken back to Lifeâold Dust! To show us all the weakness of our trustâ The emptiness and folly of our aims, The rash presumption of our baseless claims; The vanity of all our cherished schemes, The specious mockery of our worshipped dreams; The illusions of our fond expectancy, The uncertainty of all beneath the skyâ The slippery surface of the paths we try; The narrowness, the meanness of our views, The brittle nature of the tools we use, In all our undertakingsâour designsâ While some masked Power our vain work undermines! The slight materials of the towers we build, The bluntness of the weapons that we wield; The imperfection of our Earth-formed tiesâ While Passion changes and Affection dies! (Alas! our towers too oft change to our tombs, Our paths conduct but to Fate's funeral glooms; Our arms are aidlessâand our tools are toys, Thraldom our cherished tiesâand jests our joys. Our schemesâthe bright insanity of Hope; Our dreamsâthe sparkles on the dewy slope; Our trusts, our aims, our claims, all weak or wild, Though to the last we move by these beguiled), These are the truths that dimly must o'ercloud All hopes encouragedâall delights enjoyed; But ye need not arise from your repose, Cold ashes!âto confirm theseâor disclose; Our own experience should suffice full well To play the prompter and the oracle. The evidence of every day should come Home to our feelings, to our bosoms home, And serve to teach us, as on truth's own page, And make the thoughtless thinkâthe senseless, sage. You need not startle back to Life, cold clay, To bring us these stern tidings of dismay, Since Man's and Nature's works combine to show How false and fleeting are all things below; Since every being, every object here, Unite to prove that Change and Death are near; Yet we're so wedded to each dear deceit, So bigotted to every gilded cheat, So pledged to all delusions we have made Our treasures and our idols, and arrayed In coloured light that we must yet see fade, That all proves insufficient to remove From these our fond, deep, rooted, 'stablished love. Deafened are we by our own Folly's din, Blinded by cloudy vapours of our sin, Involved in dire and ever-spreading snares, Which our own prejudice or pride prepares; Fettered by chains, forged, fixed by our own handsâ Too surely fixedâtoo closely fastened bands, And blind and deaf we would unchanged remain, And trapped and fetteredâdear to us the chainâ Welcome the snareâand lovely too the cloudâ And musical those deafening clamours loud. And thus we journey on Life's rugged road, As Earth were formed our permanent abode, Till haply wakened roughly from our dream, Too late we find it is not as we deem; With blank dismay and wild remorse we wake, To find our life was one long, long mistake. Yet let me seek to win some gift of Good, Some charm to temper this rebellious blood; One passion mortifiedâone fault subdued, From this strict Schoolâthis lone and stern Retreat For retrospection and reflection meet. From this deep haunt of silence and of shade, Where many an heir of wretchedness is laid! Oh! desolate Theatre of conquering Death, Whose tiers and galleries frown our feet beneath! Oh! shadowy City of the past away! On whose mute halls shines no warm beam of day, How gloomy 'mid this glad enchanted land, So laughing, and so radiant, and so bland! Earth's cities have their names!âthy Capitals, Oh! princeliest Death!âwith their damp crumbling walls, Are namelessâundistinguishedâand unknownâ Marked on no mapâand by no splendours shown; They all are Oneâthe under Earth is all Thy mighty Fortress and masked Capital! Life interferes not with those boundaries drear, Where thy pale standard thou dost frowning rear! This solemn City now beneath our feet, This nameless, viewless, undisturbed Retreat, 'Tis but the counterpart of all that spread Beneath Earth's surface, and beneath our tread! A City peopled with a peaceful throng, Where is no strife, no noise, no wrath, no wrong; A Harbour where the long-tossed barks abide, Rocked by no breeze, and shaken by no tide; A sad Encampment of a slumbering Host, Where Life seems like but to a troubled Ghost! By some strange wayward power o'erruledâpossessedâ A dream's creationâand a moment's guest! Thou art the goal to which all paths conduct, Whose entrance no proud barriers can obstruct; The approach and the avenues are ever freeâ Victory's triumphal arch but leads to thee, Still place of peaceâwhere no rejoicings be! And proud Philosophy's long labyrinth-maze In thee concludes, though branched ten thousand ways; And Love's sweet bowery verdurous-wreathed Arcades, These, these too terminate in thy stern shades; And harsh Adversity's rough paths of thorn, They finish hereâwhere all forget to mourn! In darker climates, where great Nature seems To encourage and to inspire deep solemn dreams, The grave-grounds wear indeed, a look austere, But not the terrors that invest them here; Here, in this glowing Garden of the Earth, Which seems but made for Love, and hope, and mirth, Death's presence here lowers trebly drear and stern, And heavier shades surround the burial-urn. Oh! sad it is to turn from such a sky To the last dwellings of mortality! (Where the lost natives of these regions rest, With sightless eye, and with unconscious breast), Dark frowns the grave, contrasted thus with thee, Poetic Landâbright purple Italy! ON THE LEANING TOWER AT PISA. As one who standeth in a flitting dream, Wherein fantastic shapes perplexing teem To startle and surpriseâwe stand and look On thee, strange Structure! Doth a thunder-stroke Come noiselessly upon thee now?ânot so. We look againâand still thy glorious brow Is lowered but not struck downâyet might we think We stood where toppling on Destruction's brink Old earthquake-ruined cities shookâbut all Is subjected to Stillness' softest thrallâ There is no breath to shake the silvery air, But only to enrich with fragrance rare, With melody and freshness, clear and pure, And still thou stand'stâuninjured and secure! Whilst in a pleased astonishment we gaze On thee, fair Fabric! many feelings raise Changeful emotions in the mind, an awe Creeps slowly o'er us, while our thoughts withdraw By quick, yet imperceptible degrees (Wafted o'er Time's sea by a favouring breeze) From the more common things of common life! Something of magic influence with sweet strife Seizes on all our facultiesâaround A sense of mystery broodeth without bound. We may not raise nor pierce the veil of years Which floats round this rare structure, that appears The work of weird and supernatural handsâ That still seems sinkingâsinking where it stands! Thou ever-bending Tower! whose head is yet 'Mongst swift-winged clouds and rays of glory set; Thine origin and aim are lost and hid, A thousand changes and events amid; Who can declare for what thou wast designed? Mayhap some vain caprice of the human mind Gave thee to attract and yet repulse the eye, A strange, elaborate, bright deformity! Or was't above some grave that thou wert raised, And therefore was thy towering front abased That thou mightest look a marble mourner there, For ever sorrowing, and for ever fair, As if to bring conflicting thoughts to birth, As though at once to point to Heaven and Earth! To lean towards human things and ground-formed tiesâ To lean to all that in Earth's bosom liesâ And leaning, still to aspire unto the skies! For thus thou dostâthou slant yet soaring Tower, That seem'st but chartered to endure an hour! Thou shinest unto my fondly-lingering eye The type of Hope and of Humility! Balanced 'twixt two attractions, deep and strong, Say, hast thou vibrated and trembled long? The Eternal Mother draws thee to her breast, Do yon fair Firmaments thy fall arrest? How long shalt thou stay hovering 'twixt the twain, As though suspended by some viewless chain? How long bewilder the astonished sight, Leaning athwart the Horizon and the Light? Say, wert thou haply meant, severe, to preach With eloquenceâthat asks no aid from speechâ Unto the dwellers in this City's walls, (Whether in cabinned cells or palace halls) Sternly, of change and ruin and decay, That wait their certain and appointed day; And like the Herald that in Philip's ear Cried loud, his dismal warning-note of fear, âRemember thou art mortal,ââstill remind Thusâas in tottering helplessness inclined, That noblest fanes have bowed beneath the stroke, As shrinks the sea-beat cliff, and bends the oak, Howe'er with beauty and with strength endowed,â Have yet beneath the stroke submissive bowed; And that the proudest domes that man can rear Must earthwards stoop, yet nearer and more near; And tower and temple, pillar, arch, and shrine, Or soon or late, their lofty pride resign; And worn, and stained, and grey, must crumbling sink, And, nodding, tremble on stern Ruin's brink, And woo the Ivy's veil to enshroud them round, Ere yet they fall and load the encumbered ground. As CÃ¦sarâdignified in Deathâof old Drew round his form the robe's o'ershadowing fold, And covering up from sight his altered face, Fell at the unshaken statue's blood-stained base. Threatening thyself, thou hast stood from age to age, And yet continuest that strange strife to wage. How long shalt thou maintain that wayward war, Warped from the rigorous perpendicular? Thou makest the dwellings and the domes around, Albeit, with harmony and beauty crowned, Look rigid and unlovely in compare With thee, thus delicately poised in air! A strange fantastic charm's on thee impressed, A wild, unearthly air doth thee invest; A sort of dreamy, willowy grace attends That form which thus so beautifully bendsâ How dost thou chain and captivate the glance With thy most rare eccentric elegance! I gaze on thee with secret pride, to view The daring of Man's hand and Genius too, And recognize our Human Nature's might With an exulting and a strong delight, Through long, long ages, now wrapped round with night, Through changeful chances, and through mixed events And jarrings of this world's strange elements, That vary still the common course of thingsâ Which History's column to our notice brings Through theseâthrough allâthrough every shadowing veil, Our Human Nature's power I trace and hail! Thou lean'st, as Time himself on thee had leant, And slightly shaken thee, and gently bentâ Choosing thee for his staffâproud monument! Amidst this beautiful and wonderous land, So wronged and injured by his barbarous hand, And as he had been wrought upon to spare, Thus left thee standing as his Conqueror there! Thus leaves thee stillâunshatteredâunsubduedâ A bright memorial of his milder mood! Full many a stately dome and glorious fane May I behold ere thee I view again, But Memory still thine image shall retainâ And even in Memory shalt thou haply make The chilled frame shudder, and the senses ache. Thou startlest, yet delightest the Soul the whileâ How muchâthou magical and matchless pile! Thou shock'st, yet pleasest too, the Soul and Sense, Alarm'st their fears, yet winn'st their confidence! Beautiful-terribleâin sooth thou artâ How checkest thou now the beatings of my heart! Which yet leans to thee, as thou leanest to Earth, (As loath to leave its beauty and its mirth.) On thy smooth surface not one stain appears To speak of tempest-scathe, or shock of years; Almost appear'st thou, methinks, to play At Failureâand at Weaknessâand Decay! Like some fair child, that, fearless and elate, Assumes of reverend age the unequal gait, Teaches the vigorous limbs, firm, straight, and strong, To drag in lifeless, helpless guise, along, With arch, bold mimickryâand all the while Retains its own smooth browâits own bright smile! Thou fair and fairy Tower, even so dost thou Seem but in mockery thusâto bend and bow! ST. PETER'S. How the Soul breathes itself away to Heaven 'Midst these all Heavenly Grandeursârent and riven Seem Earth's weak tiesâeach thought becomes a soul! A Soul of fire!âthe Mind's winged glances roll Through the far Futureâwhile the silence grows To an unbounded Harmonyâwhose close Is but where Life's deep tides, o'erflowing, spread Almost too near the Eternal Fountain head! And bound in reverential awe remain, Though there continueth too the harmonious strain! But oh! so deepenedâso enrichedâthat none Of earthly mould might bear the o'erpowering tone The music of the Heaven of Heavensâthat ring While Angels strike the harp, while Seraphs singâ While thundering spheres their full-pealed anthem join, And, oh! while wakes a something more divine!â A breath of Harmony's great Source and Spring, Which poured its Soul through each existent thing; (That breath which bade Creation's fulness be, Whose echo wasâEternal Melody.) The music of the Wisdom of the Power, Which streams through Heaven's bright, fixed, unshadowed hour, However the Enthusiast of the Earth advance From height to heightâin ever-mounting trance, No moment and no mood can e'er ally, With the mixed Music of Humanity! Though to our bounded sense and clouded dream Most perfectâmost victorious and supremeâ Most overpow'ring and profound, it seem In some fine temper of the soulâto swell As though the Host of Heaven then struck the shell, Woke the fine chords, and thrilled the conscious frameâ And from the Skies the unbroken echoes came! Stillâstillâmidst all the triumphs it may own, There lurks the human breathâthe mortal tone; Even our Religion savours of the Earth, And bears too much the stamp of our dim birth, Our highest flights are checked, and weak, and low, Shallow our streams of thought in fullest flow; Our noblest bursts of truth, and zeal, and love, Dashed with some worldly care, too oft must prove Our finest strains of feeling yet are jarred By some false chord, through which the whole is marred. The solemn calm that fills these Precincts seems To melt the mind into a world of Dreams! Whileâspeechlessâbreathlessâonwards I advance, Now some light sound hath caught my earâby chance; Hark! how the faint low echoes dull and dumb, As though from Silence's own hushed depths they had come, Steal on the senseâvague, indistinct, and low; Steal onâhow softâand die awayâhow slow! And make the very stillness seem more still, So faintly floating at their own weak will, 'Mongst these enlaced and sculpture-wreathed arcades, Proud as some unpruned forest's giant shades, Methinks they seem as though to escape they tried, And sigh their last on Nature's bosom wide; In vainâfenced in and closed on every side. At strange, strange distance now appeareth all That we the Actual and the Real call! Betwixt us and the glowing, breathing world, Eternity is in a moment hurled! Another element do we respire, And all seems nobler, purer, rarer, higher, 'Twixt us, and all we deemed and called our own, An awful curtain lowered, doth sundering frown; The soul now opens to itself, and shows New worldsâthat it might ne'er before disclose; Hemmed round with petty cares, and hopes, and aims, With Earth's vain wishesâEarth's engrossing claims; But nowâand here 'tis strengthened to resist, And learns in all its boundless might to exist! 'Tis a Translation!âand when once within These mighty Walls that shut out strife and sin; Pressing the hallowed marbles of this floor, We feel new landed on some blessed shore, Some glorious Isle of beauty and of peace, Where all rough clamours, and all conflicts cease; Some heavenly Isle of harmony and joy, Where Life can lure notânor pale Death destroy; Where all the restless waves that round it roll, But make more calm that country of the Soul! 'Tis an Ascension!âon the wings of love, The wings of faith, that swift as meteors move; How are we borne insensibly above! 'Tis a divine Lustration! how the heart Feels purified in every conscious part Its favourite frailtiesâcherished sins resigned, That seemed before with every pulse entwined! Oh! that this bright abstersion could but save From stains to come, from future sullyings lave! But no! too soon that blessed charm is o'er, And we again areâall we were before! Oh! 'tis a Confirmation! look around, The stamp of Man's high origin is found In this his noblest Workâsupreme, sublime, That looks as meant to tame the tyrantâTime! This proudest labour of his artful hands, That like the Sun, 'midst its own Glory stands! Say, our charmed eyes can we far straining raise, On this outshining, matchless roof to gaze; Nor feel it must be Heaven that spreads above The all glorious Dome beneath whose cope we move; And move in all our littleness confessed, By the dread scene's stupendous pomp oppressed. Like puny, pigmy thingsâlike things of nought, Scarce seenâunless with watchful strictness soughtâ Like what we areâthe voyagers of a spanâ (What else may be that busy pilgrim, man?) Like fragile creatures of a fleeting hour, That boast no strength, no truth, no light, no power; Save what lies hid beneath the exterior frame, And that from Heaven's rich grace alone we claim! Twere well, proud shrine, could we our minds imbue For aye, with all thou hint'st of sage and true,â 'Twere well to keep the soul to that high strain, Which thou inspirestâOh! Beatific Fane. What heaps of priceless treasure here are piledâ What glory and what pomp, here proudly aisled! Lo! what a more than mystery seems to brood O'er this august and Heaven-like solitude! An awful Presenceâand a fearful Powerâ Before whose might we shuddering quail and cower! Where is the mind, that rash, or dull, or bold, Would not confess a boundless awe untold, 'Midst these outshining marvels?âhither come, Ye Sceptics!âand let this triumphant Dome Do what Creation failed to do before: Teach ye to know, to tremble, and to adore! Something of spiritual-material there Appears our own exalted doom to share! Yea! something more than marble and than stone, That speaks in our own tongue with loftiest tone! Come hitherâUnbelieversâScoffersâYe! Who nought divine through Nature's range can seeâ Come hitherâto this conquering Sanctuary! And let this Shrine of Shrinesâsublime and dread, Its own Religion o'er your spirits shed! Pronounce the âEphphatha,â that shall set you free, To tell of Truth, and hear her high decree! Its sacred light upon your darkness pour, And give you Being you ne'er knew before; Nobly advance you in Creation's scale, And bid you almost pierce within the pale! Teach you the eternal Laws supreme to know, And glorious affluence without end bestow! (Such wealth, such riches, as shall lift you high Above this bleak world's barren poverty!) Give you a boundless Lifeâa deathless Soulâ A trustâan aimâan anchor, and a goalâ A freedom, and a future, and a share In all the ordained created things that areâ In all that knowledge graspsâthat sense admiresâ That thought approvesâthat even winged hope desires! Give you a reignâbeyond the conqueror's sway, An inner Empire of perennial dayâ A Universe of Harmony and Love, Where, to one blessed end, still all things move!â A Rock to uphold yeâand a Sun to lightâ A sense of Truthâa consiousness of Rightâ A glad Eternity of peace and blissâ And moreâif more can beâyea! more than this! Give youâAh! costliest boons that ere were givenâ A pitying Saviourâand an opening Heaven! A brightening passage to a blessed abodeâ Oh! give you Allâin giving you a God! THE COLISEUM. Morningâwith sunshine, round thee streams and glows, Ruin of Ruins! and each ray that strows Its quivering splendours o'er thee gains from thee I know not what of solemn Sanctity. Time's awful Shadow streams Superior hereâ Superior?âNo! around us far and near, (While to pale memory we our Souls devote) More awful, more majestic Shadows float, And cloud and cover His!âYe boundless spread, Ye shadows of the great and glorious dead! Spirits of Prideâof Victoryâand of Might; Whose new abode is in yon World of Light! Your traces here are foundâwhere e'er we turn,â Till Earth, till Air doth with your Memory burn. Ye Men of Rome, who awed and ruled a world; Whose fame still streamsâa banner wide unfurled. Your very pastimes and your pleasures seemed Colossalâand even luxury's self redeemed, For still in these,âyourselves, yourselves ye beamed! How ransacked forests, hunted countries sent Their tributes to your feet, and largely lent Their growths, their stores, your Revels to provide, To furnish forth your sport, and swell your pride; Here Nature, seated on the throne of Art, Serenely breathes herself into the heart! And whispers consolation!âwhile bright leaves, With verdurous hues, all variously she weaves O'er the long-fractured wallsâlight webs that shroud Decay and Ruin in a friendly cloud! How doth she bend her graciously above The strange colossal Scene with looks of love. Hath she mistaken this indeed for some Of her own Worksâthis marvel of Old Rome? Her Amphitheatral Alps or Appennines,â Whose cloud-capped chain with snow pale-crested shines,â Where they, a circus of dread mountains bend, And, in a giant ring, far-sweeping tend? (Her mighty eye o'er dazzled by the show Of man's stupendous miracles below! Till their proud girth she wildly magnifies, Familiar with her own vast Earth and Skies, And makes their towering greatness yet more great, And adds to all their splendour and their state, And more of magical perfection lends, And with herself, in dreamy vision blends!) Or, like a generous rival, would she show Companionship and sympathy in woe With shrunken Art, erst reigning by her side, A sister-queen, in glory and in pride! Howe'er it beâlook round you hereâbehold, She shrouds these walls with many a trailing fold,â With many a fair festoon of quivering green, And gilds and lights and consecrates the scene! While by the alliance both gain deeper sway, Than either, in their most divine display, Could proudly compass, separate and apart; For, oh! they speak united to the Heart! Imperial wreck! how dost thou frowning stand, With wrecks and fragments heaped on every hand! And look, the chief and monarch of them all! With thy thronged arches, and thy world of wall! And the ivy folds, stirred by each gale's fresh breath, Heaved, like a bright green oceanâwhile beneath They hide tooâas the ocean hides his prey, But wrecksâand desolationâand decay! Thy giant image in the mind stamped deep, That mind shall evermore unaltered keep. So dwell the eternal Mountains and the Seaâ Once seenâfor ever on the memory! While I stand, watching thee, and lingering stay, (Scarce knowing how to tear myself away) Thou seem'st to swell with ampler sweep of state, To outstretch, to enlarge, to augment, and to dilate,â To outspread thine area wide for countless throngs, For gathered nations of all climes and tongues! Thy front more near the o'er-hanging skies to liftâ Where sunbeams blaze, and golden clouds move swiftâ 'Tis but that thou absorbest the thought and gazeâ Still chained to thee in rapture of amaze! Yea! they are transfixed, and concentrated there, Nor may aught else their strict devotion share. Thou takest the winged thoughts of the upspringing mind, Like lightnings round thy dark scathed front to bind! Its soaring energies to thee are given, Well mayest thou rear thy proud head nearer heaven! Thou fillest the Soul's deep airy wide embrace, More boundless in itself than boundless Space! Well may'st thou wax and spread and sweep and grow, To something measureless, unmatched below! Thou lookest to meâdread pileâ(for ever new, In thy worn age unto the enchanted view,) Thyself a cityâand a proud one too! Thou seemest thyself the august superb remains Of palaces and ramparts, towers and fanes, Aye! seemest, 'midst splintered pillar, shrine, and dome, The arch-wreck of allâthe very Rome of Rome! VESUVIUS. Vesuvius! mighty mystery! thou dost hide With thine uprising wreaths of smoke the pride Of crimson morning, earth's enchanted guest, What time she dons her many-jewelled vestâ And fiercely dost thou haughtily dispute, While to the skies thy blood-red spires upshootâ Deep shadowy Night's majestic Empire old, Still star by star,âwhile trembling they unfold,â Star after starâwhen they come forth serene To shed their holy Beauty o'er the scene! As thou wouldst rob them of their gentle sway, And dash the bright crowns from their brows away, The immortal splendours by their Maker given, And blot their glories from their native Heaven. But thou art foiledâfor still they gleam and smile, And win a tenderer witchery, too, the while, From the deep contrast of thy dreadful show, With their soft brightnessâimaged on the flow So clear and smooth of those pellucid wavesâ (Like molten pearls from their own hidden cavesâ) And still they start and stream, and float and rise O'er all the kindling surface of the skies! Myriads of rich and restless splendours spread Above that stern stupendous Pageant dread, As if to charm away the startled gaze From that terrific and funereal blazeâ But now it is the beauty of the Day That laughs above the mountains and the bay, And all thy spiry flames wax faint, and fail, And struggle with the sunlight, dim and paleâ Those flames that in the ghastly days of old Forth-spouted hideously, and hissing rolled O'er bright tracts they made deserts!âhigh and higher Flinging their fatal wreaths of ruin direâ O'er Cities they made Sepulchres! and crushed Beneath their ebbless waves, that gathering gushed, Till lo! it seemed great Nature's funeral pyre, One fierce Earth-withering Festival of Fire! Outstretched in boundless beauty at thy feet Its burnished surface, one rich lustrous sheet, Like a rejected garment, glittering lies The blue deep Mediterraneanâwhich the skies With more than Tyrian purple brightly stain, And yet thou spurnest it with a proud disdain! Old, shadowy, awful, and mysterious Hill! Stern instrument of fearful Wrath and Ill, Within whose breast all the Elements of Strife Conspiring, warm thee with a fatal Life, And with the weapons of a deadly Power Too darkly furnish thee, 'gainst Fate's marked Hour, And with the insignia of an awful State Surround thee, thou Earth-shaking Potentate! Lo! when thou will'st to assume thy crowning pomp, At the loud signal of thy deafening tromp, The blasting of thy Fury's breath, away The nations shrink, or drop in dust and clay. Naples, the beautiful! that smiles beneath Thy feet, as though 'twould in the face of Death Laugh up with confidence serene and sweet, And thy fierce threatenings with caressings meet, Disarming thee by gentlest loveliness, And winning theeâeven theeâto spare and bless. Naples the brightâthe beautifulâmay yet Pay thee for years allowedâa fearful debt! And that fair town, low planted at thy base, As in some sheltered and auspicious place, May quail before the outpourings of thy rage, Like the doomed cities of an earlier age, Although it smiles so calmly, cheerly now Beneath the o'erhanging shadows of thy browâ While gild yon glorious Sun's unclouded rays Its white and glistening walls, that seem to praise With shining gladness thy forbearance mild, Old Hill! whose terrors are thus boldly piled In frowning awfulness and shadowing gloom, As thou wert armed with Wrath and big with Doom,â Sombre and horrid, up to the unhurt skies, Whose sultry purple with the sapphire vies! And yet, in sooth, it seems to me at times One of imperious Man's dark haughty crimes Thus to dare Danger, and to challenge Fate, And brave great Natureâas in full-throned State Of kingly triumphâclaimedâassumedâavowedâ In luxury of Defianceâstern and proudâ In fulness of Presumption's headlong zeal, As careless of their proper woe or weal! In bold derision, and in mockery light, Of desperate threatenings, as in conscious might, In strength assured of 'stablished confidence, As though possessed of powers of sure defence; And independent of deep Nature's sway, Or with her Terrors proudly urged to play; And evermore prepared with Fate to strive, Whate'er the trying chance that may arrive; Yetâyet the dark and dreadful hour hath been Unfeared, and unforetold, and unforeseen; When on the sudden came the strokeâthe blight, And the fierce minutes in their fearful flightâ The horror-laden minutes, even grew pale At their own deadly tidings, when the mail Of Battle seemed terrifically bound Upon thy Giant-shouldersâand the Sound, The hideous Sound of thy wild roaring cries Shook all the earth, and startled all the skies; Thou gloomy, dark, impenetrable Hill, Mysterious Agent of the Eternal Will,â While thy fierce Saturnalia filled with dread The shuddering myriads, who despairing fled, Winged by Fear's wonder-working strength in vainâ They perished 'twixt the Mountain and the Main; While thou heap'dst ashes o'er the Deadâas bent, To insult them with too like a monument! It was thine hour! and thou improvedst it well, Then didst thou shouting, of thy greatness tell! Then roared thy whirlwind cryâAha!âand Lo! Nature seemed answering back stillâWoe! Woe! Woe! Hark! 'twas the echoâthen 'twas still as death, Till leaped to Lifeânew thunders of thy wrath. Aha! thou shoutedst, and the temples rocked, And the Sea trembled, like a vain thing mocked! Aha!âand Lo! the Heavens so dimmedâobscured, Were blazed with light that might not be endured! Aha!âAha!âand staggering nations fell, And the Earth hissed and howledâa fiercer Hell! The very stars seemed from their stations hurled, Dust was Mankindâand Chaos was the World! THE SYBIL'S GROT. We rested close beside the Sybil's Grot, Spring laughed out fair around! the blue bright sky, The glorious sky of fervent Italy, Bent in unbounded beauty o'er the spot, Shone cloudlessly, without one vapoury blot! Old Times came back on usâbut to the eye They shared the freshness of the bough on high, The brightness of the bright Air!âfrowning not, As in their ancientry so oft they do; Steeped, steeped in all the beauty that shone round,â Beauty of Spring, and vernal bloom! to eschew All melancholy fancies felt we bound Beneath that gladdening sky of sultriest blue, And gracious trees which clothed that turfy mound. TO NAPLES. NaplesâNaples!ârichest dittyâ PÃ¦an-songâdivinest City; Swan-like Harmony sublime, Rising o'er the tide of time; Murmurings of melodious shell, With a long, eolian swell; Lark-like hymn, and echoing strainâ Praising thine enchanted reign;â Might not serve to show forth all Thy countless splendours magical; Lo! where spreads thy blue bright bay, Like a mirror to the day; Lo! where soars thy mountain dread, Dominion beaming from his head; (Though with dire destruction blind, Oft overwhelmingly conjoined); Lo! where smile thy fertile fields, Where the vine its treasure yields; Its purple hoard of treasure rare, A golden river running there; Secretâhiddenâcostlyâpureâ Which exhaustless shall endure! Lo! where gleam thy palaced wallsâ Terraced bowers, and pillared halls; And laugh thy gardens and thy grovesâ Haunts of the graces and the lovesâ There and every where a spell Seems, bright Queen! round thee to dwell: A mastering spell, a kindling charm, To awake, to touch, to enchant, and warm! Naples! Naples!ârichest dittyâ PÃ¦an songâthou fairest Cityâ Chaunt inspired, of proudest choirâ Strain sublime of loftiest lyreâ Ne'er might serve to show forth all Thy matchless splendoursâmagical. No! no! let thine own Syren sing, With voice more sweet than silvery string; And so the beauty we behold, May be well and brightly told; But thine own Syren sole can be, The Muse that shall be worthy thee! WRITTEN AT NAPLES. 'Tis sweet to listen to this voiceful sea, While gentle airs call forth his melody; And bask in this delicious sunshine bright A Paradise of colour and of light! And watch the stealing motion of the wave, That sparkling creeps the shining shore to lave. Let me enjoy this soothing scene awhile, And learn to smile in mighty Nature's smile. Let me lay down my burthening wearying cares, And breathe the freshness of these buoyant airs; And for a timeâalthough that time be briefâ Forget I am the thrall of care and grief! 'Tis a bewilderingâa bewitching sceneâ Oh! let me fly from thoughts of what hath been. Along the shining bosom of the bay What bright luxuriant coruscations play; With smiles and dazzling sparkles thick it teems, A mass of shifting splendours and winged gleamsâ An ever changing beauty there demands A long protracted gazeâdeep splendid bands, Rich breadths of violet-huesâfade softly here Into a tenderer azure, faint, yet clear; And there a burning gold streams, deepening on, As from the great Sun's very heart 'twas won; And rosy shadows, such as blushing play, Round Alpine summits at the break of day: There lace and pave the water's surface fairâ Deep without gloom, and brilliant without glare, A thousand, thousand rainbows seem spread there; And melted though the charmed waves serene, Each heightening more the magic of the scene. 'Tis a confusion of imperial huesâ Yet one Supreme, doth free and far diffuse Its regal depthâone glorious above all, That seems to hold the rest in its proud thrall. The old Monarchic Purple of the Seas, Like the eternal emerald to the treesâ Like the everlasting ruby of the roseâ The flush of gold, the pride of harvest showsâ That rich triumphal hue of Sea and Sky, Maintaineth still its fine ascendancyâ And wheresoe'er it stains the water's breast, Wins the fond dreaming eye from all the restâ That beauteous hue,âthe Heaven and Ocean's own, Which for so long that eye as theirs hath known! Oh! 'tis a prospect to exalt and bless, And fill the heart with dream-like happiness! More zestful, when 'tis little known, and rare; More preciousâwhen a guest unlooked for there. And oh! how pure when thus it is bestowed By Nature's selfâwhen thus it hath o'erflowed From her great glorious Soul into our own, While love is heightening every feeling's toneâ How sacred when it thus seems deeply given; A more immediate giftâfrom yon bright Heaven! FAREWELL TO THE MEDITERRANEAN. Oh! Mediterranean Sea of blue, Oh! Mediterranean Sea; How softly the odorous zephyrs woo Thy waters in their glee. Oh! Mediterranean Sea of blue, Oh! Mediterranean Seaâ All homage and praises are thy due, And ever shall they be! Bright Mediterranean Sea of blue!â Clear Mediterranean wave!â I leave sweet memories, warm and true, Shrined in thy chrystal grave! Oh! Mediteranean Sea of blue, Fair Mediterranean Sea, It is sad for me now to say adieu, And a long adieu unto thee! BELLS AT NAPLES. Sweet Sound of bells; it steals upon mine ear Softly, enchantinglyâand well may seem The Talisman of many a thought and dream, The Alarum of deep Sympathies! that clear And strong return on me, while back I steer My shadowy way along the changeful stream Of life, to that dear point, where many a beam Of hope shone brightâI feel no longer here! Oh! I am where the church bells in the vale, Mine own sweet vale, the well-known and the dear Peal joyously or solemnlyâwhile pale My cheek grows with delightâthen lo! the tear Of old Affection starting, doth avail But to dispel the Illusion,âand its cheer! OH! AUSONIA'S LAND. [The subject of this being Italy I introduce it here, though it was written long before I ever saw that enchanting land.] Oh! Ausonia's LandâAusonia's Land, Where the brightest of blossoms for ever are blowing, Ausonia's climeâAusonia's strand, Where the Fountains of Music for ever are flowing. Where Passion waves his triumphant wand, While Poesy wakes his rich Lyre's deep sound; While beauty clasps in her cestus band, All the dream-enchanted world, spread round! Would you braid the white orange blossom wreath? Those flowers lost at last in their own golden graves! Oh! go, where the Summer breathes precious breath, Where the blue sky spreads like a Sea without waves. Oh! Ausonia's sunâAusonia's sky, Where that sun lives indeed like a God in his glory, Ausonia's bright Clime of old memories high, Where sweep all the gorgeous shadows of story! Where the mighty arts dwell enshrined and crowned, And speak to the Soul with a voice of power, The Soul, whose bright country there, there seems found, Where it claims its feast, its wreath, and its dower. Have ye e'er heard a warble of passion arise, Whose sound thrilled deep to the heart's pierced coreâ Go bask in the light of blue Italy's skies, Ye will hear that warble of sweetness once more! Oh! Ausonia's scenesâAusonia's skies, Where endless enchantments are thronging and thickening, Where Nature smiles, clad in her fairest of dyes, And her airs and her dews are most freshening and quickening. Doth your heart swell high 'mid the dread remains Of immortal man's deep skill and pride? Do ye love the gloom of the ivy-wreathed fanes? Oh! hasten yeâhaste to old Tiber's side! Can ye prize all mighty and solemn things, And gaze with a poet's eye around, Oh fly on expectancy's outstretched wings, To Italia's Heaven-stamped holy ground! Oh! Ausonia! brightest and loveliest of Lands! Where beauty and glory are throned, and for everâ Where Time's all subtle and precious sands, Shine out golden as those of old Pactolus' river! Do you love the morning's most orient smile, And the balmy eve when the day is done? Oh leave then our cold and cloudy isle, For the ever-flowering Land of the Sun! There is One thing lovelier than all! there is One That makes Nature more holy, more great, more fair, Makes yet purer the air, and brighter the Sun, 'Tis the Soul of Freedom!âwhy lives it not there? Oh! Ausonia fairest, most favoured Land, With thy groves, and thy gardens, thy hills, and thy fountains, Take the thunderbolt now in thy queenly hand, Be free as thy torrents, and strong as thy mountains!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS, &amp;c. FROM UNPUBLISHED POEMS. SHALL I TELL ALL THE WORLD. Shall I tell all the world of thy bright charms aloud, Shall I tell all the world of thy charms and attractions? Shall I proudly proclaim to the hushed listening crowd, What an Angel keeps guard o'er my thoughts and my actions. Shall I blazon thy beauty, and sound thy sweet name? 'Twere a theme to inspire with immortal emotion! And my subject alone, must then crown me with fame, While my soul should be stirred as the wind stirs the Ocean No! I will not do thus!âsince 'twould be but to try, Even to enkindle the World with one Passion and Madness! And to make million millions as wretched as Iâ For to love as I love is the rapture of sadness! STANZAS. And need I say to whom addressed These lines are now?âoh, no!â't were vain; The chord shall vibrate in thy breast, The truth shall lighten through thy brain! I write to say but only this: Grieve not that thou hast made me grieve. Oh! thou wert dearer far than blissâ Thou artâthou shalt be while I live! But hast thou made me grieve?âNo! No! In this World nought for me may be Of Bliss, Good, Trial, Strife, or Woeâ There's nothingânothing nowâbut thee! YES! 'TWAS BUT ONE CHANCE WORD. Yes! 't was but one chance wordâbut one chance thought, That thus endangeredâwronged me, and betrayed, That all this misery and despair hath wrought;â With weapons edged and poisoned 't was I played! In sport, I said thou wert the one for whom My heart alone could beatâalone could burn; In sport, 't was that I thus pronounced my doom, And now the dire reality must learn! In sport, I spoke of thy bright aspect's charmâ Ah! wherefore was the praise so just and true? I said that thou alone my Soul could'st warmâ In sport, I saidâtill I believed it too! Oh! if we tempt Temptations thus to come, Dare we expect to move unharmed and free? Haply it might have proved but sport to someâ But, oh! not soâwild, passionate heart! to thee! ONCE I WALKED THROUGH A WORLD. Once I walked through a world where was change, alterationâ But now I feel held in some strange spell-like thrall; One featureâone feature presents all Creation, One self-same appearance and tone runs through all! No variety greets me in Evening or Morning, In the Earth's face beneath, or the Heaven's field above; In the flower's rich investing, the star's bright adorningâ Oh! what can the Power be that rules me, but Love? The sweet air seems his breath, the soft sunshine his smiling And the solid Earth nought but his Shadowâand now, While he reigns o'er my heartâall bewildering, beguiling, I still ask, if 'tis pleasure or pain?âanswer thou! MY HEART!âPOOR HEART! My heart! poor heart! what pain thou givest me now! Thou'rt like a very Death within my Life! While scarcely to myself I dare avow The causeâthe fatal cause of all this strife. My heart! poor heart! be quick, and deeply spread Over mine whole Existence one blank hush. They say that calm and peaceful are the Dead, That their chilled breasts no future griefs can crush! But thouâoh! bitter are thy sufferings now, A struggleâa stagnationâboth in one! The dead may rest in tranquil calmâbut thouâ Oh! how in every way art thou undone. My heart! poor heart! is thy dull torpor rest? And is thy gloomy silence born of peace? Oh! no! o'erwhelmed, bewildered, and oppressed, The worst of pangs are there the last to cease. My heart! my heart! how buoyant once thou wert, How burning and how winged with fluttering hope; One careless error hath undone thee, heart! And well thou hast learned thy partâto sink and droop! DEPARTURE. Oh! what a change one little hour Hath wrought for meânought seems the same; The Air choaks my breathâthe Sunbeams lower, And all is dull, and drear, and tame. Thou'rt gone!âand with thee doth depart HopeâInspirationâLoveâand Life; That torrid whirlwind, my wild heart, Sinks, sickening, from its glowing strife! Life's but a strange sensation nowâ Impatient of myself I'm grown; I feel my soul within me bow, I feel crushed, changed, and lost, and lone. What is this self that is not thee? 'Tis a dull burdenâa vile tieâ Oh! could I but the echo be, Beloved one! of thy faintest sigh! The dream that flits across thy brain, The image of thine all-perfect frame; The glass that bears thy breath's light stain, The very scroll that keeps thy name! The shadow of thy glorious formâ The breeze that fans thy brow by chanceâ The pulse that in thy heart beats warmâ The light of thine all-dazzling glance! Thy very foot-print on the sandâ The chord that thrills to touch of thineâ The word traced lightly by thy handâ Allâaughtâthat is more thine than mine! MY BEAUTIFUL. My beautiful!âmy beautiful! Why art thou far from me? Drear flow the days nowâdrear and dull, Since gladness lives with thee! This World must have the Sun to light Its disk, with bright rays free, Or lie all shadowed round with Nightâ And I, Love! must have thee! The Main must have his own fair Moon His gentle Queen to be, Or roll, one billowy chaos soon, And I, Love! must have thee! The flower must have the South wind's breath, And, oh!âthat flowerâthe beeâ The sword must have its guardian sheathâ And I, Love! must have thee! ALONE! I LOVE TO BE ALONE. Alone!âI love to be alone, Wandering in silence, fancy-free, By none addressedâapproached by noneâ For then, then, I am most with thee! Thy voice of music fills the air, Thy smile of beauty fills the sky, And though thyself thou art not there, The world is all thy memory! Thy memory doth enchantâillume The world within me and around; Without that they were one blank gloom, But with that they're as Eden found! Alone! I would be oft alone, And shapes unseen by others see; And hear sweet voices heard by noneâ Shapes?âvoices?ânay! but thineâbut thee! THE BELOVED NAME. To hear thy name by strangers spoken With careless utterance, light and free, Which in faint whisperings, choaked and broken, I still pronounce so quiveringly. Like ice and fire it thrills, it pains me; A fatal music wraps that wordâ It startles, wounds, and yet enchains meâ The deadliest, sweetest sound e'er heard. GIVE TO ANOTHER ONE MY PART. Give to another one my part In thy so false and treacherous heart; But, oh! the memory of the love Thou borest meâcanst thou thus remove? Tear down mine image from its base, And raise another in its place; I tell thee that that other one Shall mind thee more of the idol gone! CONSTANCY. My Truth shall like the Dial stand, Whether the Sun, with radiance blandâ The Sun of Love and Hopeâshines there, Or frowns the Midnight of Despair! Howe'er thy feebler heart grow strange, My Constancy can know no change; Through doubt, through wrong, through strife, through ill,â Save but from deep to deeper still! DOUBT. Oh, Love! canst thou exist without The golden mystery of a Doubt Wrapped round thee, like a cloud around The light of lightnings yet unbound? But, oh! 'tis agony of griefâ 'Tis Misery's wildest pang and chief; No restâno stayâno strengthâno lightâ The chill, without the charm of Night. But then if Certainty should come, That Certainty soon grows thy tomb! With nought to fan thy mystic fireâ Too soon 'tis fated to expire. Thus, Love! thou must be still below, Our fate, our tyrant, and our foe; Since no way seems for thee to be Our fixed and full Felicity. INCONSTANCY. The Rainbow's and the Opal's light Seems shining o'er my visions bright; My dreams of thee, such colours play O'er my fond fancies, night and day. Their colours not alone are there, But there their change tooâoh! beware! I would not wrong thee, nor deceive; I love thee nowâbut soon shall leave! I love thee nowâbut not for longâ My Love is sunshine all, and song; And it shall surely fade, and fast, For can sweet song and sunshine last? Who can endure a calm at sea, With no adored variety? Or those long days the north doth know, Till worse than gloom the gleams they throw! No! let me love thee for awhile, A blush,âa vow,âa tear,âa smile,â Then free and fain in sooth to range, Court my still dearer idolâChange! A STAR DESERTED BY ITS SUN. A Star deserted by its Sun; A Lute by its awakening One; A Lamb by some false Shepherd left; An Infant of its Nurse bereft; A Shell tossed shoreward by the wave, On some bare rock no billows lave; A Flower forsaken by the bee; A River barred back from the Sea! Such, such am I, by thee forgot, Such, and so hopeless is my lot; Oh! could my misery make me be, But one faint fleeting dream of thee! Such is my heart, by thee disdained, In every pulse and feeling pained; Oh! that this pain could make it pine, Into the Shadow but of thine! A WHISPERED WORD. A whispered wordâone whispered word, Came o'er me like an earthquake's shock, My heart too swiftly surely heard, And on that very instantâbroke! Broke!âbut 'tis like some shattered rock, Split by the thunder's burst of wrath, Which, proud survivor of the shock, Stands, its own monument of death! IN FORMER YEARS. In former years, oh! how did many a dream Come o'er my brain, to kindle and to bless; If my heart ached then, buoyed on life's young stream, It ached but with its far-stretched Hope's excess. But nowâthe heavy differenceânow, alas! It knows to thrill but to the touch of care; And while the joyless minutes darkening pass, It achesâthe deadly Aching of Despair! BROKEN HEARTED!âBROKEN HEARTED! Broken hearted!âbroken hearted, Wildly, wholly broken hearted, Still she watched for one departed, While that bruised heart sorely smarted. Broken hearted!âbroken hearted, Withered, like a stricken flower; Yet one gleam of winged hope darted Through the horrors of that hour! âBroken hearted!âbroken hearted, With a love so fond and true, Oh! it surely hath imparted, Of its truth some share to you. âBroken hearted!âbroken hearted, Still my thoughts, my pangs renew; Yet methinks, thus lorn and parted, Some kind memories are my due!â Broken hearted!âbroken hearted, Still she sought Hope's fires to fan, Ever mocked and ever thwarted, When to flash, those fires began. Broken hearted!âbroken hearted, Vain were energies exerted, Still the tears of anguish started, Till she died for the departed! 'TIS WELL FOR ME. MANUEL TO INEZ. 'Tis well for me those eyes so maddening, Still make my soul in trances lie, The intensity of Feeling's deadening, And that I feel beneath thine eye! 'Tis overstrained, vague, strange, and fearful, And leaves no strong impression clear, My breath grows choakedâmine eye grows tearful, 'Tis all confusion, doubt, and fear. Were't not soâstill should I be painting On memory's tablets each rare charm; 'Tis well that rapt, o'erborne, and fainting, My Soul escapes that deeper harm. Had I a little less of feeling, More dangerous might that feeling prove; But that excess seems almost stealing The peril from the power of Love! When thou'rt away, oh! matchless Being, When thou'rt away I breathe again; I feelâI feelâlike one that's fleeing From ruin, misery, and from pain. The tyranny is so o'erpowering, I joy to snatch one moment's calm; And, coward-like, shrinking back and cowering, I seek Oblivion's softening balm. Perchance thou lovest me; that sweet story Those maddening, maddening eyes have told, With their soul-searching rays of glory, That heart and mind in durance hold. I do believe thou lovest me, dearest, Yet who shall say my love is blest, When its best semblance, and its nearest, Is a Volcano in the breast. No! pity meâAll ye that ever Have borne like burdens of distress; Such love can ne'er be happyânever, Though All conspire to cheer and bless. No! in itself 'tis too much anguishâ A poisoned crownâa gilded curse; We pineâwe doubtâwe writheâwe languishâ Scarce Fortune's wrongs can make it worse! The love some feelâa peaceful current May glide in smooth and measured flow; No boiling surgeâno dashing torrentâ But their love is not my loveâno! Oh! 'tis a rageâa spasmâa fever Torn, tortured through its own excessâ Such love can ne'er be happyânever, Though crowned with every Happiness! LOVE AND PRIDE. Farewell, then, oh! Farewell to thee, I own that thou wert dear to me; But Love shall never bend me down, An abject, slavish mood to own! Since thou canst love me notâalas! As I wouldâmust be lovedâI pass With step of firm decision on, And say â'tis best to mourn alone.â For all on this Earth mourners areâ And what is Love but a deep share In all the shadowing ills that fall On Mortalsâbound by care's strict thrall? Farewell, thenânow farewell to thee, Dearâah! too dear wert thou to me; For all my Courage and my Pride But urged to thisâthen drooped and died! But urged to this last proud farewellâ And now must I for ever dwellâ Since these forsake me and departâ With mine own burning, breaking heart! MY LOVE HATH BEEN A LOVELY DREAM. My Love hath been a lovely dream, And dare we, dare we hope for more?â Borne on Life's darkly-rushing stream, Fast to the unknownâthe viewless shore! My Love a lovely dream hath been; 'Tis overâmust I be content, And struggle through the darkened scene To which its smile such radiance lent? My Love hath proved a lovely dreamâ And dark now looks Reality!â That meteor-flashâthat rainbow-gleam So charmed the fond enraptured eye. My Love hath been the loveliest dream, And dare we, dare we hope for more? What else doth Life itself even seem But Dream in Dreamâtill all is o'er? FAREWELL! LIFE'S MADE UP OF FAREWELLS. Farewell! Life's made up of Farewells, But thisâoh! thisâalas! 'tis now; Dejection in my crushed heart quells Even Passion's wild and fervid glow! Farewell! my Life is but Farewells To every hope and dream, henceforth; Yet Love to thee my soul impels, True as the needle to the north! Farewell! no lossesâno Farewells Await usâin the worlds aboveâ There, where no groan of anguish tells That Suffering is the same with Love! Farewell!âthe grave is strong and stern, And there at last the sufferer hiesâ There Passion must forget to burnâ Passion!âthat King of Agonies! TRUE LOVE. And dost thou ask me to express my love? Alas! it soars my struggling powers above! But since thou will'st it, fondly will I seek That more than feelingâmore than lifeâto speak. In thy prosperityâstrict watch and ward Still will I keep, thy precious weal to guard; And in this anxious serviceâbut in this Place all my worldly, all my wished-for bliss! In thine adversityâifâfearful thoughtâ Life's harsher lessons thou must yet be taught; Closelier will I cling round thee,âevermoreâ As the ivy round the oak when storm-blasts roar. If this ungrateful world should thee desert, Since ah! beware, 'tis hollow at the heart; I will make up for all the Love thou hast lost, And in thy worst distress adore thee most. I'll doat on thee when All beside denyâ When All forsake theeâyet will I not flyâ When All frown on theeâI will fondlier smile, And more respect thee when the rest revile. Thro' gloom, thro' grief, thro' scorn, reproach, neglect, I will more follow theeâand more affect; I will be All in truth that others seemâ Why!âthis is Loveâthe rest's an idle dream! OH! THAT I COULD BUT LOOK ON THEE! Oh! that I could but look on thee, But dare to meet those dangerous eyes; My passionâmine idolatry That solace grievously denies. I envyâhow I envy those Who can meet steadfastly thy look, To a refinement in my woes, That such I cannot, dare not brook. There's such an Echo in my heart; Thy voice to me is almost lost! Ah, see!âBeloved One, that thou art, What pains my least light pleasures cost! If I but once confront thy glance, My very soul seems whirled away In some strange agonizing trance, And wrenched from its yet throbbing clay! Like one without or soul or senseâ In thy dear Presence, LoveâI seem Victim of Passion too intense, That freezes up Existence' Stream. Yes! with a weight of death and frost, On its wild pulses, lies my heart; And soul, and sense, and life seem lostâ Tillâdoom yet worse than deathâwe part! THE BIRTH OF LOVE. What mean theyâthose who speak of Love As having reigned throughout all years; Created by the Heaven above, In one bright birth with yonder spheres? It could not be! 'twas with thy birth Alone the Heavenly power was born: It came aloneâwith thee to Earth, And ye had one sweet natal morn! Ah! meâhow could they dare pretendâ 'Twas passion that they felt of old; Ere Nature to the world did lend Theeâparagon of matchless mould? How jealous-angry feel I now 'Gainst all that ever dared to think The Fates could thus on them bestow That costly cupâ'tis Heaven to drink! How jealous-angry do I feel 'Gainst all that ever dared to dream That Rapture fate to them could deal, Unless a faint Prophetic gleam! A faint prophetic glimpse and gleam Of an Emotion yet to beâ For surely such it well might seemâ How could they love that ne'er saw Thee? A vague, mysterious, dubious senseâ Of a deep feeling yet unknownâ While hung the world in strange suspenseâ Ere that bright mystery's truth was shown! A dim and dreamy ante-past Of thatâthey were not doomed to know, Yet happy in the faint light castâ Thusâo'er their dreary path below! But Love, in all its truth and might, Was never known nor felt beforeâ Without the Sun could they have light? Without the Sea its pearly store? No! think it notâ'tis falseâ'tis vain; Noneânone were ever loved but thee; And, Idol of my heart and brain, None shall dare love thee nowâbut me. THE ADIEU. Now, now, because the foolish careless crowd Proclaimâalas! thy love for me aloud; Thou thus can'st slight me, Cruel, and can'st scorn And leave me hapless, fated, and forlorn. But no! thou shalt not long with wounded pride Struggle that miscalled love to crush or hideâ One sighâFarewell!âone lookâand I am goneâ Forgive the manyâand forget the One! THE PICTURE. Like the fond Corinthian maid, Thy bright likeness, love, I traceâ Every feature shines displayed; Every feature of thy face! But, alas!âmore painful farâ Mine's a more laborious partâ Throbbing-quick my tablets areâ Still I trace it on my heart! Like the fond Corinthian still I thy likenessâlove! designâ With Devotion's care and skill; Till the work's like theeâdivine! But, alas!âonce, once she drewâ That form she lived but to adore; I my labour still renewâ Ten hundred thousand times and more! THE DEFEAT. Oft have I striven 'gainst adverse fate, And oft have I victorious beenâ And movedâtriumphant and elate Through many a desolated scene! But, nowâI fearâI fearâfor now, Dire odds against me seem to be; How can I choose but yield and bow To Fateâand conquering Loveâand Thee? MANUEL TO INEZ. Dark thy lash lies drooping low, Let it shroud the deep eye under: When I gaze on theeâsweet foe! Lest I die with wonder. Every look those dear eyes dart, Some wandering thought of mine must capture; Oh! begone from meâdepart!â Lest I die with Rapture! Most perfect of all living forms, Shaped in too consummate fashion, Veil that glance that thrills, that warms, Lest I die with Passion! BeautyâGraceâthy handmaids beâ Made for theeâall hearts to captureâ And for all who look on theeâ Were PassionâWonderâmade and Rapture! I LOVE THEE IN ALL WAYS. I love thee in all ways, in all degrees, My Soul dost thou so wildly, wholly seize! I love thee in each measure, in each kind, With soul, and life, and strength, and heart, and mind! All earthly feelings, Love, for thee I feel, Quick Adoration's fireâDevotion's zeal; The melting warmth of softest tenderness, And wild keen Passion's uncontrolled excess! Bright Friendship's steady and untroubled flow, And deep-sown Sympathy's mysterious glow; And yet a Love, far, far beyond all theseâ I love thee past all measures and degrees! REMEMBER ME, AND FORGET ME. To thee I pray, to thee I sue, Remember and forget me too,â If ever I thy heart could move, Rememberâand forget me Love! When none beside are sweetly near, To answer back thy smile or tear; When none beside companion thee, Dearest, Oh! deign remember me. When bowed with melancholy hours, A wanderer 'mid forsaken bowers, With none to love, and none to bless, Call upon me in thy distress. When thou would'st seek, and seek in vain, Some solace for thy heart's sick pain, And that the thought a balm might be, Oh! then remember love and me. When thou hast little need of aught To soothe thy heart, tÃ² cheer thy thought, Amid the noisy haunts of men, Forget meâOh! forget me then. WHENEVER THOU REMEMBEREST ME. Whenever thou rememberest me, Remember my true love for thee; That deep and fond and faithful love, Which years nor distance can remove. Forget not thou my heart's strong faithâ Fervent as Life, and strong as Deathâ Still, still devoted in distress, And patient in its passionateness. Repressing jealousy and doubt, Which love ne'er yet was felt without; Lest these should cloud thy dearer joy, Lest these should cross thee with annoy. Remember how I lived for thee, And gloried thus thy slave to be;â Lived upon every breath and word That passed those blessed lips adored. Remember mine unwearying care Thy sorrows or thy joys to share; Remember mine unvarying truth, The deep devotion of my youth. Remember my fond arts and wiles To call back to thy cheekâits smiles; My toils to serve, my cares to please, Remember thisâRemember these! Remember thisâRemember these! I pray thee loveâon bended kneesâ Oh! still when thou rememberest me, Remember my fond Love for thee! AND ART THOU GONE? And art thou goneâthou dear Oneâgone? And I in sorrow and aloneâ The Sun may brightly shine to-day, Reluctantly I meet each ray. Each ray that shining seems to throw A fuller light upon my woe! And, like a gilded shaft, to smite My heart through my tear-troubled sight. And Oh! there is excuse for tearsâ As by a chasmy gulf of years We're severed now, and torn apartâ There is no dial for the heart! Rent by the keenly-furrowing plough Of Absence, moments yawn and grow To nameless portions of dull Time, And mock his measure and his chime. 'TIS DONE. INEZ. 'Tis done! and the dream and its triumphs are o'erâ But not so with the pang, and the rage, and the fever!â Must I now not for ever unceasing deplore, Is my wretchedness sealed not for ever and ever? Wherever I turn, I but meet with dismay, The Day is one twilight of shadows and hazes; The Night, in its gloomy and solemn array, One Chaos of clouds and of phantoms and mazes. 'Tis done! and the Dream and its triumphs are o'erâ But not so with the Memory, the Unrest and the Sorrowâ My heart's fond cry is stillââshall I cease to deplore?â While Despair sees to-day but renewed in to-morrow! FRIEND, GENTLEST FRIEND. Friendâgentlest Friendâstill turn thine eye, On Nature's charms, seek her the most, So shall with kindling pulse beat high Thy young warm heart, by fears uncrost. Be thine her stars, her flowers, her springs, The glory spread o'er every part; The poetry her aspect brings, Unto the quick and watchful heart. Yet ah!â'tis vainâfor well I know How deeply, brightly, was enshrined, Before my slavery and my woe, That more than passion in my mind! Alas! the love of lovely things, Of stars, flowers, sunshine, music, birds, Of smiling skies, and silvery springs, And Poetry's own magic words. Alas! the love of these shields not From pain and sorrow and dismay, Or less unhappy were my lot, Less lowering were my life's brief day! We loveâwe loveâbut I know well, That when the heart's engrossedâenchained, Those thousand loves but strengthening swell The one Love, deeply there contained! SELF GOVERNMENT. Oh! what is this dangerous tampering with peace, What means, foolish heart, thy perplexed hesitation? Let the dream, the delusion pass over and cease, Or is't, thou false, vain, fevered brain, thy creation? What means this wild troubleâwhat mean these fond sighs? This hurrying confusionâthis dreamy distraction? Even now let me rend this dim veil from mine eyes, And plunge in the World of Adventure and Action! These Phantasies nursed but in idlesse and calm, The breath of Exertion shall speedily banish, And the stormiest and roughest of Showers were but balm, Could they bid these strange Visions fade swiftly and vanish. Then arise, weak and rash One, be strong, tutored heart, And cast to the winds all these follies and fancies, Loftier things seek to learn!âtry a far worthier part!â 'Tis Self-government still that all gladness enhances! Yes! away with these vapourous chimÃ¦ras and vainâ Away with winged Fancy's too high-wrought effusions; Let me subject them now unto Reason's stern reign, And check this dark inroad of dreams and illusions! Oh! if many would pause at the first fatal signs Of Danger and Harmâat the opening and onset, Life's Firmament then, that still changefully shines, Might not darken and threaten so ofttimes at Sunset! TO TELL THEE THAT I LOVE THEE AND TO DIE. It was a lovely Maiden, wan and pale, Her mournful aspect told her mournful tale, Grief was stamped deeply on that pallid face, And on her fragile form's slight willowy grace. She wandered hitherâthitherâresting not, As ill at ease in every different spot, As seeking, ever seeking something still, With Hope as blank as Disappointment's chill; Or flying, ever flying, something there, To meet at every turn a new despair. So hied she hither, thitherânow she gazed Wildly, as though at her own grief amazed; And now she fixed her dimmed eyes on the ground, As though she could notâdared not look around. Then, on the sudden, clasping her pale hands, And standing as some mournful statue stands, A Niobe, or Ariadneâloneâ For ever saddening in eternal stone! She burst into a low, faint, earnest strain, As though its passion could subdue her pain. âTo tell thee that I love theeâoh! to tell thee this and die! This is my Soul's one fervent wish, my Heart's eternal cry! I love theeâaye! I love thee, and thou know'st notâdream'st it not, Nor thinkest of all my maddening pangs, nor pitiest my lorn lot. âHow torturinglyâhow torturinglyâthose pangs wound this racked brain, This wrung and heavy heart of loveâof wretchedness and pain, I have dragged through the dull languor of such dark, chill, mortal hours, As have enfeebled soul and mind, and all their withering powers. âI have watched my very life's life melt, and fade, and waste away, With a conscious and a certain, but a long, cold, slow decay! To tell thee that I love theeâbut to tell thee this and die, When I've read one answering meaning in thy deep, dark, glorious eye! âTo press thy hand unto my lipsâto my fading lips and heart, And to that pressure sweetly feel my ebbing life depart; A changeâa deep and sudden changeâeven then, and thus to prove, Forgetting then to liveâyet not forgetting thus to love! âTo see the world sink fast away, and pass off from my gaze, And still thine image to retain, thro' all the gathering haze; Oh! in thine ear, thy pitying ear, to breathe my last long sigh, To tell thee that I love thee, and then, even in telling, die!â A pauseâmethought the Maiden's wish was crowned, And that, while Fancy's haunting shapes gleamed round, And haply rose before her fevered eye Her lover's form, and stood fair imaged by. She deemed she had that secret love betrayed, Long nursed in silence, solitude, and shade; Then found the fate she had so prayed, so sought, And rapturedâdied upon the very thought! While in that passionate burst, her sorrows ceased, And her soul parted, lightened, and released. But once again the plaintive sounds I heard, With more of faultering weakness in each word; More choaked, more hollow, came the tearful tone, A low swan-musicâdeath in every moan! âTo tell thee that I love thee, and to die! Can iron Fate itself that prayer deny? To ask but this, and yet have this deniedâ For this to sigh, and vainly to have sighed! I am so lessoned and so lost in woeâ Oh! I can weave no brighter dream belowâ I dwell on this until it seems the excess, The crown and height of all earth's happiness. My soul hath but one wish, my heart one cry,â To tell thee that I love thee, and to die!â She pausedâand Echo answered, with faint sigh, O! treacherous counsellor and gloomyââdie!â 'Twas thus she wailed in Sorrow's choicest tone, Till felt the hearer like herselfâundone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. TO?. When griefs oppress my wearied mind, Thou onlyâever true and kindâ Canst wile that woe away; Canst soothe the restless strife within, And back to peace and comfort win The heart that owns thy sway. And how shall I that love reward, The debt were deepâthe task were hard, My powers and strength above; Yet oh! one only deep return Dost thou requireâor wish to earn, Love asks but answering Love! SORROW IS MY PERPETUAL GUEST. Sorrow is my perpetual, lasting guest, The constant inmate of my mournful breast, Joy but an ignus fatuus light at best, Just seen and gone. Spring, with her blushing dews and costly blooms, Sufficeth not to light my heart's cold glooms; I walk 'mid Shadows such as brood o'er tombs, And all alone. Once on each cloud, each breeze, each ray of light, My thoughts shot forth in freedom and in might, Now they lie crushed beneath a weight of night, Crushed and undone! But is this doom a different doom from theirs Who walk with me this world of troublous cares?â How can I dream I am of Sorrow's heirs The only one? Are any happy on this changeful sphere, So happy as to know not grief or fearâ Blest strangers to the pangâthe sighâthe tear? Oh! surely none! CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE. These threatening clouds above my head May break in thick and shadowy showersâ Those infant stormsâyet no faint dread Shall darken o'er my placid hours. Oh! when the Sun shines bright above, And angry clouds afar are driven; We cannot show with zealous love How much we trust the o'erruling Heaven! I love to think, when clouds are near, Of the unseen hand that spreads them round; And then dismiss my careful fearâ Since there my hope of hopes I ground! Yon threat'ning clouds then o'er my head May break in dark and thickening showers; But no faint, forward-looking dread Shall dim my now delightful hours! THE FATAL RESOLVE. Myrtilla exclaimed, âYes, Alexis shall die, The deadliest of darts from Love's quiver I'll borrow; And if I may trust to this arm and this eye, The Rebel's last sigh shall be heaved ere to-morrow.â She resolved that the Youth should be mortally wounded, And dread was the pause ere the arrow was thrown; But so hard was his heart, that alas! it rebounded, And the death-doing weapon was lodged in her own. TO M. S. W., ON HER BIRTHDAY, 1833. October! grant one glistening ray, To hail and deck this happy morn; This gentle and auspicious day, When Maryâflower of flowers was born. October! yield one softening smile, To greet her on her onward pathâ Or let her rosy smiles beguile Thee of thy bleak and blustering wrath. October! spare one blushing flower, To wreathe amidst her tresses wild; To bring a dream of Spring's glad hour To herâthe fair and fairy child! Yet noâdark monthâand changeful time; Thou still mayst frown, around, aboveâ Yet smiles for her a cloudless climeâ That homeâwhose light's a Mother's love! MY TEARS ARE PRISONERS. My tears are prisoners in my burning brain, And were they loosened could they ease my painâ Or half the anguish of my grief discloseâ No! tears were meant for lesser, lighter woes! My thoughts by language unrevealed remain, A heavy yoke they bearâa galling chainâ Why should they greet the careless and the cold, And to the dull their treasure-depths unfold? Why should they draw upon themselves the sneer Of heartless apathy, or satire's jeer? My hopes, too, hide and keep themselves apartâ 'Tis well to make a deep world of the heart! To shut it from the hollow world without; To keep it pure from darkness and from doubtâ My tears! be still chained prisoners in my brain; My heart! thy sorrows and thy hopes contain! THE MAIDEN'S LAMENTATION. There flows a bright stream yonder; But I may not, as of yore, Midst the wild flowers near its shoreâ Calmly rest or wander. In other days of gladness, By that bright stream I strayed; But now I seek the shade, For joy is turned to sadness! Joy now can bless me never, Its latest rays are set: I pray but to forgetâ 'Tis my life's long endeavour. There frowns no changeâno blightingâ Still fair the wild flowers growâ The waves in music flow To me how undelighting! My sole guest now is sorrow; Yet is their hope for all! The slave may break his thrall, And I may die to-morrow! REFORMâLIBERTYâMARCH OF INTELLECTâ EQUALITY. When men have set their groaning brethren free, And firm established pure Equality; And in the glorious cause still keen and warm, Have proudly reared the Standard of Reform, Perhaps they may have leisure then to turn, While with the same immortal zeal they burn, And look through all great Nature's mighty range, Intent to effect a salutary change; And in the end, through their unwearied pains, Redress all grievances and rend all chains. Repress all murmurings, and revise all laws, Retrieve all errors, and repair all flaws; And to the Mighty Mother say, âBe free! Thou gav'st us Lifeâwe bring thee Liberty!â Not resting till the boundless Whole's improved, And every shade of every stain removed; And every speck, and slur, and spot's effaced, And all in fair Perfection smiles embraced; And, fixed on broadest basis, strong and sure, For ever framed to triumph and endure, Their lofty Edifice shall nobly standâ Who dares to hint that it is built on sand? Who, sneering, dares incredulous to say âRome was not built and finished in a day? How dare ye hope that pile, through Time shall tower, Run up with lath and plaster in an hour?â (These ignoramuses have yet to learn The present age doth such trite maxims spurn, And reasoneth in the gross and in the lump, And to conclusions doth sublimely jump; And works with patent tools, in special mode, And finds to every pointâa royal roadâ Smooth, well Macadamizedânay, better far, A rail-road worthy great Minerva's car!) Then let them through Creation play the spy, (Like a philosopherâor like Paul Pry) Through all the Earth and Air, and Sea and Sky; For Oh! be sure there's no time to be lost, Whate'er the great experiment may cost, For all must be re-modelled and re-planned, All doth a strict and prompt research demand; A most inquisitorial keen survey, And let there be no doubting nor delay. It were perhaps indeed the better plan To appoint Commissioners, to sift and scan, To ferret here and flutter thereâin short, And then to make their full, fair, free Report; Unbiassed and unbribedâunsued, unswayedâ But duly prompted, and discreetly paid! Equality!âthat cry's far echoed round, Equality!âlet Seas and Skies resound, Mountains and vallies, rocks, shores, isles, and woods, Swamps, mines, and caverns, wastes, abysses, floods. But do they echo back with loud acclaim That magic word, that all-inspiring name? Our shout exultant do they thunder back? Alas! methinks they're dull, or deaf, or slack. The true Republican must groaning see How Nature seems to spurn Equality! And his high soul at once must rage and mourn With deep compassion and indignant scorn, To view through all her proud and ample field, Through all her regions to his gaze revealed, How still she patronizes Aristocracy, And turns her back on lofty-soul'd Democracy; And shows this bad example to us all,â Keeps this in servitudeâholds that in thrallâ Fastidious and exclusive plays her part, In short, shows she's a Tory at her heart! Behold the unworthy System carried on By the abject Planets and the imperious Sunâ Their haughty Governor and RulerâAh! Their Grand Seignorâtheir fiery Padishah! Behold him throned in pride and state monarchical, Egregious 'tisâpreposterous quite and farcical; And still a dangerous precedent presents To all who've tyrannous views and proud intents. This should be altered and subverted quite, There now must be Equality of Lightâ The Planets must their Magna Charta have, How can a Star remain a tramelled slave? Now let the spell that bursts their thrall be spoken, Their wrongs abolished, and their fetters broken; And let the Sun, whose reign must now be short, Yield with good grace his courtiers and his court; With decent dignity consent to fall, And grow a private individual! Let his freed Subjects claim their long-reft rightsâ Away with sycophants and satellites, Slaves, followers, flatterers, minions, parasites. (In these great days, so glorious to all nations, Subordination's worst of ordinations Must be dispensed with, and quite put aside; (Too long hath it been borne, too often tried,) Now that Reform's sublime illuminati Light up the Worldâfrom Greenland unto Hayti, And from Spitzbergen, where cold ice-rocks lie, Even to thy classic bayâOh, Botany! That old and outworn rule shall be forgot, Or banished wholly to the latter spot!) Ah! if the truth be told, these Planets too, For learned Astronomers have vouched it true, These Planets now themselves even boast beside Their own fixed trains to swell their pettier pride! Their second-hand pretensions to exalt, And track their footsteps through the Eternal Vault; Those vassals subject to a vassal's sway, The understrappers' understrappers they! The followers' followersâand the fooled ones' fools, Oh, Nature! and are these thy Courts and Schools? Let each one now with prompt decision sever From his own proper tyrantâand for ever! Oh! Mars and Venus! and thou, Georgium Sidus! That Freedom share in which we men so pride us. Oh! four-mooned Jupiter!âOh! belted Saturn, From human beings deign to take a patternâ Oh! moons of JupiterâOh! Saturn's beltâ Now may the chain of your subjection melt! 'Tis mighty strange, methinks, that Mother Earth, Who gave and gives the Sons of Freedom birth, Herself the mate of Freedomâshould delay To point the path, and marshall forth the way, To show the example, and to take the lead, And foremost in the lofty track to tread, Her Sister-stars with generous zeal to guide, And prompt that act which must their fates decide. Those Planetsâworlds themselvesâshould they still wear Dull Slavery's brand, and her vile penance share? What! should they watch the Sun with servile glance, And bless the light of his proud countenance, Performing strict their stated courses still, Like blindfold Dobbins drudging in a millâ (That high-bred team, that should scorn every trace Of servitude, installed in their proud place!) Still round and round their haughty centre driven, Oh! let their yoke be snapped, their fetters riven, Let each one to Perfection's State approach, And boldly run an opposition coach! As for the light he lends themâlet that pass, Surely that well might be supplied with gas; And if some difficulties should arise, To our busy Planet let them turn their eyes; If they will only send us to direct us, A Plenipotentiary, with a Prospectus, With Protocols and Ultimatums too, And all the appointed ceremonials due, Even a Clerk, with signed and sealed credentials, We will supply them straight with all the essentialsâ That contract willingly the Earth will make, And all the complex business undertake. The Earth?âI beg to state, I mean by this Our own enlightened Great Metropolis, Where they still moil, and toil, with countless aims, The indefatigable Sons of Thames! Whose projects, plans, discoveries, and conceitsâ Pretensions and inventionsâschemes and featsâ TheoriesâartsâsystemsâSpeculations chief, Are past all summing up, and all belief! And if, perhaps, some may be found to say, âHow can they find to yon far realms a way?â The answer's obviousâsimple as 'tis wise, And satisfactory as most replies, âImprovement stands not still, but aye doth steer, Free its proud course, its swift and far career; Is there a day, an hour, but doth produce Some great discovery for the general use? Communication, doubtless, will be soon So perfect, mails will travel to the moon!â Communication, doubtless, will improve 'Twixt us and all beneath, around, above. The first Geology's deep science assists! Particularly those styled Platonists, Who 'mongst her zealous votaries may be found, And seem to plunge the deepest under ground; Who pierce into the low, dark, shadowy realms, Where the Ancients placed their Heroes, without helms On their bare skulls, or swords in their bleached hands, Condemned to wander, in dejected bands, By sullen Acheron's harsh, sterile coasts, A herd of drear, uncomfortable Ghosts. But I have wandered from my subject now, And fallen into digressions rather low. The aerial ship, which, doubtless, all have seen, Would form an admirable go-between, Made through all currents free to cut its wayâ 'Twas just exhibited but the other dayâ To brave those currents all 'twas ripe and ready, But fell in with a current rather heady, Which o'er it exercised undue dominionâ The current 'twas of popular opinion. Also another current's want might join To fix its fate and hasten its decline, The absence of a little currentâcoin! They saidâalthough I cannot say who said itâ It first fell into debt, then in discredit, And thus the poor balloon fell, after all, Without a parachute to arrest its fall; Yet 'twas arrestedâbut, alas! who'd think it? Only the more to abase it and to sink it. And with regret the sequel I repeat, The unlucky ship was borne off to the Fleet! I vouch not for the fact, and but relate These rumours light, then current of its fate. This castle in the airâso saith report, Was made to fleetâto stand was not its forte. But, after all, it may be this narration Had no more than itself of a foundation! But to return to our past theme, I trust The planets soon will their affairs adjust, A nobler system for themselves create, And leave proud Sol in Sol-itary State. The cometsâthey, perhaps, long since broke through The bonds that held them, and the chains that drew The noble rebels of the realms above, See how in loosest dignity they move; Yet dragging after them their lengthened train, As captives just escaped, their shattered chainâ (Long in the noisome dungeon closely pent, 'Mid all the horrors of imprisonment)â That chain which in the hurry of their flight They lingered not to disentangle quite. But trailing loose, behind their footsteps freed, It acts but as the spur acts on the steed, And urges more their full and fiery speed; Reminds them still of dangers late o'ercome, And all the sufferings of their former doom! These seem the glorious liberals of the air, (And, truly, the best place for them is there, Since there is room for them to twist and turn, To sweep, and heave, and swell, and blaze, and burn, In those wide, boundless fields outspread above, Where, independant of the rest, they move, And thus less mischief's likely to befall, Than in our busy, crowded, close-packed ball!) And of the solar system they appear The incendiaries, that, nobly, far and near, Would all in one huge conflagration wrap, And then the extinguisher on all things clap; And raise from the ashes of the world undone, A new, enlightened, and all perfect one; That shall, indeed, have no need of a sun,â (So very much illumined from within, To light it from without, were waste and sin!) The mutineers of those blue regions high,â 'Tis well for us they don't come very nigh. The Radical Reformers, staunch and strong, Protesting boldly 'gainst each shameful wrong, The Washingtons and noble Bolivars, Amongst the restless clouds and rolling stars; The Cromwells and the Catilines sublime, Of the etherial and cerulean clime; The Andreas Hofers, Guy Fawkes, William Tells, Who fain would sound corruption's last of knells;â Wat Tylers, Perkin Warbecks, and Jack Cades, Of those far realms whence they would sweep all shades. What do I say?âmy Muse in climax rise, The mighty Agitators of the skies, Clad in a brazen and a blazing mail, And furnished with a most surprising tail, They seem, the while they plough the firmament, (As though they sought some outlet still or vent) To scrape around them an enormous rent. To make a void and vacuum as they go, While round themselves the golden halo's glow And silver atmosphere's soft, fainter light Shines with a pure and sterling lustre bright. Lo! 'tis a noble sight to upwards gaze On the far thing in all its glittering blaze; High freedom's gifts, and doctrines pure, intense, That far thing seems to ex-pound them and dis-pense; To note them down, and scorn all petty change, Still circulating free on its wide range. When peal of thunders burst in bellowing war, When bickering lightnings flash out from afar, Whose hissing tongues mix with the echoing clap, And zig-zag runâlike rivers on a map. That awfulâmightyâand terrificâform, Seems like the embodied genius of the Storm; And borne on car with swift, loud, rushing wheel, To encourage bickeringâand to urge repeal; (Yetâby such contradictions things are swayed, Also a little of the Peal afraid!) The clapâthe hissâthe mutterâand the groan; The growlâthe scowlâthe flashâthe clash his own. See that great comet as it proudly strays, Avoiding still the beaten turnpike ways, Through which the slavish, stupid planets toil For many a weary league and dreary mile; How finely doth he run his restive race, And seems to seek some snug abiding place; Yet while he shapes his wide, extensive course, With matchless front, and with imposing force, His red-hot carâwith its wild, plunging teams, A little dangerous to his neighbours seems; But then can great Reformers such as he Checked by such slight considerations be? These must be crushed if that their hour is come; What are small units in so great a sum? What! shall they on their glorious march delay For a few individual interests? nay! Nor for doomed thousands that oppose their way? What for the public do they ever care? 'Tis the Re-public claims their thought and prayer; But still the comet wins our warm concern, Beheld it soarâsinkâsweepâretireâreturn, As though some egress it impatient sought, Rapid as light, prompt even as prompter's thought; Anxiousâobedient still to Freedom's call, To leap the Universe's chrystal wall, And yet a little fearful of a fall, And therefore going round to seek the true gate, Perhaps it may at last come to a New-gate. And here I fain would humbly offer now, If Freedom's child such freedoms will allow, A little wholesome counsel, which, no doubt, He'll doâas most do with adviceâwithout; Great Nature's rather a determined dame, And something in her features and her frame Like our Old British Constitution too; Thus, though she deigns indulgently to view Those who persist their own paths to pursue, Yet Order she with Liberty requires,â Apt to repress unlawful, wild desires, And visit with stern indignation those Who break the harmony of her repose; Her fair and lofty fabric strive to shake, And on her weal and peace fierce inroads make; Whose innovations wrong her equipoise, Whose zeal her pure economy destroys; (That rash, uncalculating headstrong zeal, That heeds not proof, remonstrance, or appeal;) Therefore the erratic wanderer should forbear To tempt too much her patienceâit is clear; Since it may chance, if he too far presume, That he may meet a most unpleasant doom; She may affix her strict yoke to his neck, And too abruptly his career may check; His tailâa rat-tail make without remorse, And suddenly arrest him in his course; Therefore 'twere better, sure, at all events, To avoid such sad and untoward accidents, Such undesirable results to shun, And rather cautiously his race to run; Lest he should sink beneath each twinkling star low, While her strong hand drags down his destined car low. Old Ocean, he whose streams are scarce of nectar, A blustering, boisterous, haughty, headstrong Hector, Who seizeth upon most things as his prey, That haply fall in his unpitying way; What boundless treasures doth not he amass! Yet pays no tithe, no income-tax, alas! Doth he not pile his riches heap on heap, Until they almost overflow the deep; And hoards his wealth, too, like a sullen miser, So that the World's no better and no wiser. Say, hath he notâoutrageous shame of shames, On every side his tributary streams? 'Twould baffle even a Newton or a Necker, To calculate what flows to his Exchequer; To him each river duly pays his fee In clearly-chiming, silver currency; Still, still his vast possessions to enlarge, Those streams to him their weighty debts discharge; But though they're liquidated day by day, Still they're unliquidated, strange to say, They're still in debt, and still they're forced to pay; While the deep ties that bound to him before Are but consolidated evermore! And if their haughty master ever deign To fee them for their serviceâslight's their gain; Even those remunerative wages small, Are paid in draughts salineâif paid at all; Or in a molten coin of base alloy, Which doth corrupt their pure state, and destroy. In plague and famine, and in war or peace, Still must his floating capital increase; Since, though he is a miser, it is true, He is a stirring speculator too; Yet doth not in low earth-born schemes embark, Nor ever doth he go beyond his mark; He's ever found on change, whate'er betide, A mighty dabbler in the funds beside; (But then 'tis in the sinking fund the most, As many a wreck can vouch on many a coast.) Still fluctuatingâfor his great settling day Hath not yet come, although in time it may. What ministers can sum (the while they grudge it) The whole contents of his huge boundless Budget? What, though no landed property be his, Except in insulated patches 'tis,â He sometimes wondrous inroads makes in land, And seems to claim the shores on either hand; And when or swoln by floods, or stirred by breeze, Seems on the brink of turning these to seize, (Ne'er scruples the proud main, if none restrain, To encroach on many another's fair domain, And by main force his conquests to maintain!) 'Tis when he wills to arm and take the fieldâ His surface glittering like a mirrored shield!â Yet strange it is, he oft doth then appear A calmer, gentler, milder guise to wear; And smoothing down his rugged mien that awes, Turns his attention more to Agrarian laws. While when reduced to straits, with judgment sound, He cultivates a little more the ground,â I fear in farming he but ill succeeds, And finds his only crop, a crop of weeds! Those streams that to his briny bosom glide, And ever add unto his copious tide, Those streams may break their banksâbut his secure, Fixed, beyond Europe's firmest banksâendure! The Bank of England not so sure and safeâ Though tempests try them and the waters chafe. But to the grievous subject to return: Of all the wealth he gainsâbut doth not earn, Fed by the labour of the industrious poor, And fattening on his lazy Sinecure; (In politics and business it is said, He's but a waverer, and a lie-a-bed); Enriched by other's toil, and what is worse, All that he gets goes to his privy purse. You'll talk perhaps with scientific skill, Of the aqueous vapours rising from him still, Evaporation's laws, clouds, dews, and rain, And how the Rivers but pay back again What they received from his exhaustless store, By some such curious processes before, And say âof Earth he's the Great Reservoir.â This may be true, but I should like to see How he discharges his moist ministry. This may be true, but still this thought pursues, He doubtless gaineth far more than his dues. This may be very fine, and very wise, But sure a shorter process might suffice; And if we must have mists, and dews, and rain, Pray, why must these be filtered through the main? On this, I feel quite sure, you may depend, Not half he gets doth he restore or spend; For as we all must know, he's very deep, And the whole thing might sure be done more cheap. (I'm told his Secretaries and chief Clerks, Are little better than notorious sharks.) His case Investigation doth demand, His tides, his ebbs, his flows, must be replanned, Till Nature takes the hint, too careless slattern, And all is modelled on Reform Bill pattern; On strict economy and justice based, Then shall be no corruption and no waste. Oh! the Elements' Administration soon Must be improvedâthis tyrant in the Moon, His tyrant finds, he still endures her sway, And in his turn is taught too to obey! Thus by the plan in operation now Tyrants to greater tyrants only bow; The Oppressor to the Oppressor's made to yield, And the worst Despot ever wins the field. He his imperious proud command delivers Unto the obedient and obsequious rivers, That still subservient to his mandate toil, And bear their sparkling tribute many a mile; And leave their own fair vales and banks of flowers, And smiling landscapes and gay laughing bowers, To plunge in his vast boiling cauldron wide, Swallowed for ever in the oblivious tide. The while he's led himself like a tame lion, By the inflexible imperious Dian; Orâshame upon the gudgeon and the gabyâ Like a huge, rolling Brobdignadian Baby! In leading strings conducted by her hand, Quite subject to her influence and command; Still hither, thither, wandering at her beck, Just as she wills to urge him, or to check. The mountains, tooâcan any one deny That these hold up their heads much, much too high, And give themselves by far too many airs, (While each winged breeze their lofty summit shares, Which to the sky its peak aspiring bares,) They look down with contempt on fields and valesâ Let them be balanced strictly in the scales: We will examine them a little nigher, And rigidly into their claims enquire; Look to their title deeds, and try their right, And see why they're exalted to this height. Although their crests are lofty, we must own, Yet oft their colours are obscurely shown: What their supporters are we do not know, But shrewdly we suspect they're base and low; Upon these matters we can throw no light, But then they are beneath our notice quite! As for their motto it might well be this, And peradventure, too, in sooth it isâ âQuo sursum volo videreâto bootâ âDum spiro speroâ would their bearings suitâ While many a pinnacle and many a spire Shoots from their sides, and doth from sight retire. Perchance if pertinaciously they'd track Their lineage nowâand to their source look back, They'd find no such great cause for swelling pride; That is, at least, on the Maternal Side; As for the farther side that may perchance There claims to proud precedence more advance; But then those claims are, it is certain, still Quite in the cloudsâbeyond the Herald's skill; 'Twere up-hill work to mount to them, and vainâ And quite impossible to make them plain! And though we care not for such things a pin, Nay! think superiority a sinâ We've heard strange things said of their origin, Hints given of their low station in the past, Doubts cast on their creation and their caste, Whether they were of the Ancient Earth com-peers, Or of a later dateâof modern years. We've found our skill to track their rising slight, And their Descent a slippery subject quite. We've heard of fierce convulsions in our planet: We've heard of heaving strataâMelting Graniteâ Of grey Mont Blanc's sublime and reverend head Being raised alone to its dominion dread By some deep under plotâsome low cabal Which History takes no notice of at all; We've heard of wond'rous changes in brief space, Of lowliest things raised to the loftiest place, In short, we've heard a tale so dark and strange, And so replete with unexampled change, As to a level these proud Mountains brings, Straightways, with base, flat, plain, low under thingsâ Enough to strip them of their claims, and thrust These high Pretenders back to native dustâ Enough of their vain triumphs to despoil, And show they bear the marks of many a soil. Like mighty Mushrooms they have seemed to grow, No one can tell exactly when or howâ How they were raised, in what peculiar mode, Nor to what they their swift advancement owed. (But though the reasons we may never sound, Which caused them to be raised o'er all around, We'll hope, in charity, they were profound!) 'Tis with repugnance terms so harsh we useâ But then it is not ours to pick and choose. (The truth, at every riskâat any rate, Shall be our guide, though rather out of date, A little obsolete in this bright age, So quick, inventive, subtle, shrewd, and sage. (It is, perhaps, too much, indeed, to expect, That aught so clever should be quite correctâ Its comments are upon too vast a scale To admit of all the closeness of detailâ 'Tis too original those laws to obey, Which bid us keep veracity's straight way; Too fanciful Fact's dull rules to recallâ Too lively to be strictly literal!) 'Tis with repugnance we so harshly speak, But 'tis in vain a milder phrase we seek; They seem but Upstarts lifted from the mire, However now they may in pride aspire, As if they sought and struggled to soar higher. (They're but another proof, and one most clear, Of the Inequalities of Fortune here; Her ups and downsâher rises and her falls; While one unto a lofty post she calls, And doth rejoice another to debase, And keep for ever in inferior place, While far above the clouds she raiseth this, And that she hurls deep, deep into the abyss; While this she swells into a soaring Alp, And crowns with glittering snows its high-reared scalp, And that condemns to Life's low humble vale, At least thus sheltered from the inclement gale. But now the Leveller is Abroad, and now 'Tis time to abase the proud and lifted brow, To exalt the humble and to crush the high; But let us kÃ¨ep in mindâEquality! If these but change their places we shall be Exactly where we wereâfor aught I see. But shall this be so poorly managed?âNo! All we must now make lofty, or all low, But how on Earth can we contrive it so?) The Hills a strict examination ask, (Although, in truth, 't were a gigantic task), They need the impartial scrutiny of those Who are ever glad and prompt to interpose; And these shall ne'er from their stern duty swerve, But deal such doom to them as they deserve; And though in some positions they are found Useful, perchance, to mark a country's bound, And to divide the tribes of neighbouring states, And check vain jealousies and fond debates, And form a giant Fortress for the Freeâ (But no!âforgiveâtriumphant Liberty! Thou, all sufficient to thyself, canst well Dispense with Fortress and with Citadel. Oh! thou canst well and joyfully dispense With all extraneous bulwarks or defence; Thy only bulwark thine own red right arm, Enough to guard 'gainst every dire alarm; Thy ramparts but the bodies of thy sons, Though these are rather inconvenient ones!) And though a home and herbage somewhat thin, They may afford the bounding bouquetin, And to the hunters of the Hills may yield, For hardy sports, a wide and noble field, And well supply the River's chrystal course, Which, in their heights untrodden, take their source, And thence descend, in glad and gushing force, To make the valleys laugh, the fields rejoice, And lend fair Nature both a smile and voice; And Summer's parching heats and scorching glows May moderate with their everlasting snows, And sometimes, too, may temper wintry weatherâ We well can do without them altogether. Surely a substitute might now be found, If we with strict attention search around, (In these ingenious and productive days, So fertile in fresh methods and new waysâ So full of fine expedients as they are, That we may well and fearlessly declare, Nor yet be charged with daring Heterodoxy, That most things may be done as well by proxy), A substitute, in short, that will fulfil These various duties with consummate skillâ (Sure in the lofty labour to succeedâ Not bent on base remuneration's meed; But who would solely for Reform's great sake, The overwhelming business undertake), That would as useful and efficient prove As those huge idlers proudly throned above, (And easier to dismiss and to remove), These ostentatious, ponderous, swoln Grandees, That lead a life of sedentary ease, Puffed up and solemnâas they thought alone, With pompous notions, lofty and high flown, Of their own greatness and renown sublime, To which no rivals might aspire to climb; These lazy Overseers of Nature's parish, That look o'er field, and stream, and waste, and marish; O'er grove and heath, and bank, and lake, and woodâ But with their supervision do small goodâ Ayeâlet us now their services refuse, And find some better suited to our viewsâ Confined, too, within fairer, juster bounds, And 'stablished also on more equal grounds. Yet let their claims with us have their due weight, We must not rashly fix upon their fate; Something seems whispering midst this general cry, For Rights and Justice, and for Libertyâ Equalityâand Independence proud. This general cry of the Universal crowd For Toleration, too, in every sense Unbounded, and enlightened, and immense. Something seems whispering, âyet withdraw the ban, The Rights of Mountains are the Rights of Man, When first established on the rolling Earth, From the first moment of their Titan birth, They had their own free charter and fixed law, And, doubtless, one without the slightest flaw; And, certainly, we must concede 'tis true, Equality hath nought with them to do; They never could be meant half way to meet Those that but kiss the dust now of their feet; Their right is to be leftâand not oppressed, And not of their proud station dispossessed; Their right is to be leftâa curious right, Which yet to oppose we are not enabled quite. They have grounded claims and rooted principles, And in exalted views sure each excels. They have solid reasonings, too, upon their side, Which, while in stable firmness they abide, 'Twere vain to shakeâ'twere difficult to o'ercomeâ Some blunt and broad, and keenly pointed some! And while they tower above, unbowed, unbent, We must allow them to be Eminent, And fitted admirably to their place, Which even their foes must own they greatly grace, And though formed of impenetrable stuff, And generally hard, and rude, and rough, Nor given much to the soft and melting mood, Since Nature's sighs and tears they've long withstood, And though abrupt, cold, distant, high, and dry, Their strict uprightness no one can deny. Straight-forward still in all transactions found, And fixed in steadfastness, and sure, and sound; No restlessness, no variation there, Speaks of Ambition's sad and sleepless care: Their ends accomplished areâtheir points are gainedâ And their Ambition's summit is attained. No hollow schemes their ample breasts employ, To undermine their quiet and destroy. They are above all littlenesses quite, And brave the eyes of allâand court the light; And still exposed to observation stand, Full in the sight of all the gazing land, Nor ever are their dealings underhand. Then if we may not grant them a reprieve, Let them from our hands at the least receive The rigorous justice that is but their due, While carefully we look their conduct through, The generous courtesyâthe just regardâ (Yet to look through them will be somewhat hard.) But hence! away! if we're to reason so, If we're so generous and so just to grow, Our Party soon will suffer its death blow. What will become of our transcendant cause If such reflections are to give us pause? What will become of true Reformâif thus We grow so weakly, vainly scrupulous, What will be hers, and her great Champions' fate, If we're to be thus too considerate? Thus conscientious, delicate, and nice, Alas! 'twill be decided in a trice. The glorious hopes we have so fondly formed, Those hopes which every liberal bosom warmed, Soon will they be o'erborne and set aside, If by such rigid principles we guide Reform's auspicious and inspiring march, (Which yet hath reached not its triumphal arch)â Its noble progressâits imposing courseâ But shall we seal its doom without remorse? No!âthose quixotic, high-flown notions vain, Should be dismissed from every rational brain. The mountains seem to oppose our darling scheme, Then let them vanish like an o'ergrown dream! Their shivered fragments the pressed Earth shall strew, Though they may look at first a little blue, They shall assume then each their proper place, That isâthey shall be cut down to their base. 'Mongst trees too in their native forests proud, A verdant, shadowy, whispering, waving crowd, Much is there that requires revision there, And close attention and unwearied care, For harsh Oppression and imperious Pride Shade all the earth, and stalk still side by side; But they must quickly turn o'er a new leaf, Or drink of the same bowl of shame and grief With the poor victims of their hateful sway, Condemned to vegetateâthe tyrant's prey. (Nipped in the bud should they long since have been, Ere they had thus o'ershadowed Earth's wide scene), They must prepare to bowâor witheredâsappedâ The staff of their support full rudely snapped; They shall lie prostrateâtorn up by the roots, With all their prickly thorns and poisonous fruits, For we will stem them in their progress now, Lop off their living shootsâand lay them low. So let Oppression and his helpmeet Pride Perish and wither, darkly side by side. But to return unto our trees againâ Our muse had branched off to a different strain, And yet seemed haunted by the self-same theme, And wrapped as in a sort of dryad dreamâ Transplanted, wandering in a sylvan moodâ Lostâas the tender babes wereâin a wood. Shameful it is and scandalous to see The proud Oak towering o'er each kindred tree; Is't from its merit raised to that high place? No! 'tis the trick of all the Oaken Race. Their stripling-saplings are as sure to upraise Their heads o'er birch, and beech, and box, and bays, (As though even in the acorns were instilled That pride with which the after-tree is filled), As we enlightened Liberals to forbear To take of lofty honours our just share, (Or if indeed we condescend to take, To accept them solely for our Country's sake, And for the People's good, since while we live For that and them alone we wish to thrive, For that and them assuredly alone We wish to pick preferment's savoury bone, To robe in luxury's purple, or to dwell In palace hall instead of humble cell). A vile hereditary privilege 'tisâ And here there's surely much that is amissâ Perhaps you'll say, âyet recollect how goodâ How fineâhow firmâhow valuable's the wood; Permit them to tower proudly o'er the plain, They form the noblest bulwark of the Main! âOld England's wooden walls,â and âhearts of oak,â Are sounds whose spell was made not to be broke; Shall not these proud trees then of rugged frame Our favour and indulgence deeply claimâ More than indulgenceâgratitude and loveâ And reign the sacred monarchs of the grove! The whisper of their leaves says âTrafalgar,â They seem to breathe a thousand tales of war, And talk of stormy fights and stormy gales, Where no rough gust, nor sulphurous blast prevails; Our pride, our strength, our stay, our wealth, our boast, Let them enjoy, for they have earned their post.â Now, I must tell my honourable friend (If that his fine oration's at an end), My honourable friend, who thus essays, By launching forth so boldly in their praise, To win me round their merits to remark, (I own I do admire their gallant bark!)â In short, yourself, dear Reader, if 'tis you, Who thus breaks forth in strainsânot very new, Who thus defends and vindicates the Oak, And deals around a sharp and vigorous stroke, That, after all, this is but idle rant, Dull, threadbare, obsolete, exploded cant, That will not do in these enlightened times, Howe'er with ancient prejudice it chimesâ ReformâReform we need in prose and rhymes. As for your âhearts of oak,â and âwooden walls,â And all the glory which such sound recalls, Methinks, while wooden heads so much abound, (Enough might doubtless with great ease be found To build a very Wall of China round These happy shores, whose sway half Earth obeysâ Excuse the bull that 'mongst this china strays), We can full well with wooden walls dispense, Nor need to draw security from thence; And hearts of stone besides abound enoughâ Formed truly of impenetrable stuffâ Hard as the hardest adamantine rock, To bind us roundâand barricade and block. Besides, were we their merits to allow, And their assumed importance all to avow, And to their strained pretensions to defer, Nor deem their faithful fond admirers err; Even granting all, and more than all you say, Still wherefore this vain showâthis proud display, Why can't they do this in a modest way? But the truth isâthe heroic mania's past, The Sun of Glory is indeed o'ercast! The laurelâguerdon of the Victor's fieldâ Its place of pride must now consent to yield; And it hath had its high and haughty day, And long enjoyed pre-eminence of swayâ The Olive now shall smiling reign supreme, And be the bard's beloved and brightest theme; Let it wave wide and free from shore to shore, Not like its rival, fed with tears of gore, But with the daintiest dewsâthe softest showersâ With sunshine fostered, and entwined with flowersâ Yetâhold, my muse, as plentifully now The tide of blood doth unreceding flowâ Its lava wave streams on as fast and deep As when the swords of banded nations leap Forth from their scabbards in their flashing light, Full in the gazing World's attentive sight, And dyes the Olive of as red a hue As ever yet the Conqueror's laurel knewâ But then it flows not from the open wound Given upon Battle's marked and sanctioned ground, But chiefly from the thrust of ambushed foe, The secret graze and gashâthe stealthy blow. Look on the ceaseless, sanguinary rain That drops upon the glowing fields of Spain, As 'twere the natural dew-fall of the plain! But then, again, undoubtedly 'tis true The laurel can have nought with this to do. The Olive shadows o'er that sea of blood As erst it smiled above the o'erwhelming flood, Beneath the Olive's smileâthe Olive's shade, The murtherous bands through crimson torrents wade, Till we might almost think the treacherous plant, Whose sacred charm our peace-preservers vaunt, The treacherous Olive poured forth all its oil To feed the flame, and speed and spread the broil; Since we are assuredâand to believe are bound, That Europe's in a state of Peace profound; The deadly feuds that scar one nation's breast, Are, it should seem, as nothing to the restâ Who look with most polite indifference on To see their neighbours ruined and undone. A strict neutrality preserving thus, Save and except should Briton, Gaul, or Russ, See any lucky opening for himself To seize a share of profit, power, and pelf, Then farewell to indifferenceâonâonâonâ Something there is to be acquired and won, These high disinterested feelings roused, Lo! either side is zealously espoused. Then the neutrality is neutralized, Then the Arbiterâwho comes as such disguisedâ Plays his insidious and his specious part, And the poor country's doubly doomed to smart. It must be owned the Assassinations there, The butcheringsâslaughteringsâexecutions, bear No sort of likeness to the wars of oldâ The proud encountersâand the conflicts bold, When Honour's self presided o'er the frayâ When Valour's soul burnt brightly through the day, And Mercy smiled o'er Battle's stern array! When all was free, and true, and just, and fair, And high heroic feeling triumphed there. No, no!âthese brawls are scarce upon a par With what was anciently considered war, The old, honourable, high, chivalric strife,â (Which, though but too profuse of human life, Stooped not to mangle with the murderer's knife.) This storm of strifeâthis hideous work of wrathâ This march of Anarchyâthis masque of Deathâ This hell of passions in their deadliest moodâ This ghastly orgyâand this feast of bloodâ These barbarous Saturnalia of the tombâ This desperate drama of portentous gloomâ This hideous serviceânay! this hardened tradeâ This ruffian gameâby ruthless bravoes playedâ Is as unlike as black can be to white From the ancient rules and 'stablished modes of fight In the old barbaric timesâthe illiberal daysâ Dullâunenlightened by Reform's bright rays, Those gothic ages, so obtuse and blind, Uncivilizedâuntaughtâand unrefined! This modern mode of warfareâif, indeed, 'Tis war to bid your hundred thousands bleedâ But I beg pardonâwhat I mean to say Isâthis improved, enlightened, peaceful way Of settling differences and clearing doubts, 'Midst whoops and yells, indeed, and groans and shouts, And clouds sulphureous, dense, and close, and dun, That load the darkened air, and veil the sun, And all the fearful sounds and sights that wait On the red hour of conflictâbig with fateâ Is wholly different from the proud fields fought Of old by generous championsâfree, unbought. What, though these horrors are spread wide around, And Rapine's wrongs, and Discord's plagues aboundâ What, though aboundeth blood, and steel, and flame, This struggle hath a high and honoured claimâ 'Tis consecrated by a cherished name! (Which we must hope is taken not in vainâ Which should be spared the least and lightest stainâ) Even thineâtranscendent Libertyâfor whom So many thousands meet a fearful doom. Though, if we did not know how pure and fair The ends that sanctify these foul means were, We almost might be tempted to exclaim, Shame on the monstersâon the murderers shameâ Just Heaven discards them, let Mankind disownâ Down with the demons, with the dastards down. And though we know in what all-righteous cause These deeds are doneâwe are constrained to pause And marvel that thine Altar should be fed With offerings so obscene, so dark and dread. A moment still we pause in doubtful mood, Whether such evil ere can lead to good, For truly these terrific deeds appear, If all be true that meets the startled ear, However sanctioned by thy name divine, Far worthier of the shambles than the shrine. Fain, fain would I demand of those that know, (Or best should know, whence spring these founts of woe), If nothing can be done at least to allay Those frightful horrorsâfraught with black dismay, To check those monstrous deedsâand change the scene To one more hallowedâhappy and serene? Fain would I askâyet while I ask I feel The question can but pitiably reveal My blindnessâignorance and dulness too, (That cannot mark in colours clear and trueâ The objects thus presented to my view; That cannot pierce the dense clouds hovering round The Sun, obscured by their deep gloom profound), Whether such Peaceâso reeking and so redâ So fellâso fierceâso deadly and so dread; So much with Anarchy's distractions cursed, So stained with Massacre's and Discord's worst; So black with murderâand so foul with crime, So dyed with unstaunched gore's empurpling slime; So split with schism too, and so scarred with shame, So hurled from honourâand so fallen from fame, Is truly better, wiserâhappier far, (While feud succeeds to feudâand jar to jarâ) Than what our fathers wont to christen War. But these are childish doubtsâunworthy quite Of one who lives in this blest age of light! Lo! let us lift the loudly echoing strain In honour of the Olive's oily reign, And lay the flattering unction to our souls, That concord soon shall quench strife's scattered coals, The exulting PÃ¦an undiscouraged raise, While Peace and Plenty claim our tuneful praise. In Peace and Plenty let us all rejoice; Hail Plenty! and hail Peace!âhush! boding voiceâ Who speaks with Repetition's wearying tone, That dull monotony may call her own; Who speaks with shrill, and harsh, and painful note; Whose echoes with a gloomy sadness float Upon the troubled and disordered airâ And wake a thousand sighs and murmurs there, That voice as it with mournful pathos swells Upon Hispania's thrice-told sufferings dwellsâ Gaul's festering plagueâand Erin's famished plight. Here, Mutiny's pent blastâthere Misery's blight)â The restless Lusian's false, uncertain stateâ Pretended loyalty and hidden hateâ The slave in soul full often would be free, To do the desperate deeds that darkest be. The impatient fiend is raging in his soulâ And pants to escape from thraldom and controul; All Law seems despotism, all Rule a curse, All Orderâbut oppression's yoke or worse! The dastard knave at heart, full oft would gain Power to inflict, unpunished, death and pain To take securely his own impious way, And with impunity to stab and slay, And deal his midnight murders unrestrained, His actions like his passionsâfree, unchained; The inborn despot oft with clamorous cry Shouts loud and long for boundless liberty, That he may then all rights and charters spurn, And tyrannize and trample in his turn! Here the Son turned against his Sire, smites down That sacred arm, and spills that bloodâhis own; While friend with friend is wreathed in war-embrace, Nor either heart owns feeling's faintest trace, The helpless Orphan's wan and wasted cheek Behold carnationed by the fatal streak; The Octogenarian's scattered hairs and hoar, Bedabbled with his slowly oozing gore! The brother stricken by the brother's brand, And babes and women seized by murderous hand, And hurled into their dark and sudden tomb, And given by hardened monsters to their doom; Infirmity and infancy consigned To one foul pit with countless victims lined; The hamlet firedâthe altar overthrownâ The cries for mercy to the wild winds blownâ There the dire treasons evermore renewed, The dark plots bredâthe desperate projects brewed; The vile conspiracies in secret hatched, The murderous opportunities still watched; The strict precautions and the sleepless care To avoid the danger and to escape the snare; The unbending attitude of close defenceâ The sharp suspicionâsharpened by suspense; The never-ceasing cloak, and fence, and guard, The still-increasing restless watch and ward; The system of dissembling and distrustâ The ever-growing doubtsâtoo oft proved justâ The countless measures ta'en, and schemes pursued, The anxious vigilsâceaselessly renewedâ And why?âto shield the Elected and the Approvedâ The AdoredâDesiredâthe AppointedâPraisedâBelovedâ To shield the Chosen One from steel and flame, From black Assassination's treacherous aimâ The Master from his faithful Servants, bound By ties so tenderâpaction so profoundâ The Chief from his devoted followers too, His voluntary vassals fond and trueâ The Freeman Citizen in Freedom's land, From every Citizen's uplifted hand! The while the indulgent Ruler is compelled At length, a sharper sword than ever held His Predecessors o'er their People's necks, (Who ne'er required more salutary checks)â To wield with purpose fixed and stern resolve, While plot by plot doth threateningly evolveâ Above his loving, much loved subjects' heads, While terror reigns, and discontent still spreadsâ The liberal Monarch's goaded to become The tyrant buried in self-centred gloom! The outbreak then of schemes with crimes replete, Their full discoveryâfailureâand defeat; And then the fearful consummationâthen The dread scene viewed again, and oft againâ The dark catastropheâthe frightful endâ The lesson read to those it may not mend!â The Culprit stopped in his insane career, Doomed on the Stage of fate and blood to appearâ A Public Spectacle of awe and fear; The Offender taken in his own dire toilsâ Power's outstretched Arm, and Justice' deadly Spoils; And first her Preparation's solemn gloom, Ere yet the Wretch is dragged unto his doom; First the awful ceremonial and array, And then the sanguinary stern displayâ The scaffold reeking with the Patriot's goreâ But shed to cause the flow of torrents more! (Alas! while such dark needful horrors stainâ In Franceâher liberal Monarch's prosperous reign; It can be doubted and denied by none, The Executive department is well done!) While still the hideous tale excitesâinflamesâ Disordered fancies and distempered frames, The Example proves a dire and deadly spellâ Felt but too widelyâfollowed but too wellâ While gain at once dark thoughts that lacked an aimâ A nucleusâand a natureâand a name! The infection spreadsâthe abhorred illusion grows, And works a thousand and a thousand woes. The Monster proves a hallowed Martyr then, Poor Wretch! yet worthier of the Maniac's den, Than of the Martyr's shrineâor Murderer's shroud, The moon-struck Idol of the mistaught crowd; And while spreads far and wide the Felon's fame, Until half Europe rings with the unknown name, New Candidates unfailingly arise For equal honoursâand an equal prize, Till black cabals, conspiracies, and crimes, Thought of with shudderings in less sapient timesâ The attempts of Traitors, and the fall of Kings, Are common as familiar household things, Where'er you turn, in all men's mouths and minds, While awe nor checksânor lost decorum binds. But hold!âenough!âOh! fearful voice!âaway! Thou surely speakest to mock and to betray. It cannot be!âthe horrid hateful tale That loads the air with sighs, and taints the gale; That darkens o'er the sunniest smile of day, And gloomier shades would cast o'er night's dim way. It must be forgedâbe fabricatedâsureâ For Men nor Angels could such things endure! We will not mark it, and we will not hear, But turn a deaf and a determined ear, And drown its echoes with the chorussed song, That hails the joys that unto Peace belong; With our glad chaunt's inspired and proud acclaim, O'erpower those sounds of Sorrow and of Shame! But now must I my former paths re-tread, Resume of my discourse the broken threadâ Return, in short, to where I was before (Too wont to wander to an alien shore,) And trespass thus on foreign grounds no more. Else may the Reader yawnâthe Critic frownâ With just disapprobation, I must own; For 'tis unwise, and wearisome, and wrong, To rove through such eccentric paths along; Then let me wake from my digressive dream, And hasten back to the neglected theme From which I thus was strangely drawn away, And tempted, half unconsciously, to stray. Dear Reader!âsurely I have said enough To stamp your speech as weak bombastic stuff, To clear the mist from your deluded eyes, And show you where the egregious error lies, And strip the illusion of its fair disguise. The truth in all its fulness to disclose, And all the vain deception to exposeâ To prove how Time strange alteration brings, And how much changed the present state of things; To expound the whole strange mystery, and explain, And chase these fond phantasmas of the brain; These dim hallucinations all to chase, And fix ideas more useful in their place. Methinks you now must be convinced indeed, And ready to renounce the Heroic creed, And own that navalâmilitary fame, Are grown the very echoes of a name; That midst the progress which this age hath made, These are completely thrown into the shade; That nought of similarity subsists, That nothing of analogy exists Between the glorious struggles of the Past, And feuds by which our Firmament's o'ercast; Between those high, ambitious dreams of old, And the dark truths of this our Age of Gold; Between the emprising Leaders of these daysâ And Leaders now, but of the Emprize that paysâ 'Tis different allâand let crest-fallen Mars, Who scarce will patronize our present wars, (Whose emblems and whose symbols seem to have grown Far meeter than plumed helm or laurel crownâ The marrowbones and cleavers, which at times Disturb our streets with their discordant chimes) To his own planet now for refuge fly, And turn the indignant terrors of his eye From those whose sires erst served him and adored, And wielded fearlessly their stainless swordâ Sans peur et sans reproche, right gallant knights! But then they knew not of mankind's proud rights. For lion spirits and for hearts of oak, And stalwart arms to deal the swerveless stroke; For noble natures, gentle as they are brave, Though prompt to strikeâyet ever prone to save; For souls with lofty, generous zeal inspired, For minds with lasting, genuinÃ© ardour fired, For deeds of glorious and of proud emprize, For high Ambition, which with lifted eyes Sees Fame and Glory beckoning from afar, And rushes panting to the stormy war, (Alone for Honour's hireâRenown's bright ray, Unmindful of the plunder and the pay; Fond fool!âfor so we sager mortals deemâ To yield all solid profits for a dream!) We now forbear (and wisely too) to look, Where should we find themâin what niche or nook, If we the vain and wearying survey took? We find we do as well without them quite, Since we are so sagacious and so bright; (What need of hands of prowess, hearts of proof, If Craft and Cunning lend their cloven hoof?) And for that Glory and that Fame now bowed Beneath Oblivion's cold and crushing cloud, We feel 'twas a delusion and a dream, A very bubble on Time's rapid streamâ Feel 'twas a vulgar error and mistake, Such as these sapient times will never makeâ And all the memories that we erst revered, To every child of England's soil endeared, And all the sympathies stamped deep before In every bosom's thrilled and trembling coreâ And all the associations that seemed once Sacred in British eyesâno faint response Claim now in British heartsâ'tis past, 'tis o'er, To be repeated and revived no more, The heroic feeling for heroic deeds,â We now rejoice but when sedition speeds, Nor mourn but when some malefactor bleeds; And while our Albion is content to take Her rival's hints, and follow in their wake, Content to play a low inferior part, She that was once the world's great mighty heart, Quite satisfied to fill a second place, Nor seek her ancient glories to retraceâ Such memories are indeed but our disgrace! The Age of Chivalryâsaid Burkeâis past, The Age of Fame and Honour followeth fast! As for this Ageâwhen all men, all things know, What skill can its distinctive features show? Kaleidoscopal and phantasmagorial, Its hues chameleon-like, its lights quite boreal; A Proteus-period, changed from day to day, Which endless aspects doth by turns display. Ten thousand characters it still assumes, Ten thousand formsâthat pass like fleeting fumesâ So, wreathed in myriad shapes the smoke ascends, It curlsâit floatsâit pointsâit swellsâit bendsâ 'Tis thisâ'tis thatâ'tis hereâ'tis thereâ'tis noughtâ Gone like a sighâand vanished like a thought; No shape was there it did not seem to try, Now 'twas a columnânow a canopy; Now 'twas a floating scarfâand now a shieldâ (That dim and massy, darkeneth all the field). So doth the smoke ascend, and so the show Of this strange age doth vary still below. I've seen bright butterflies superbly mailed In rainbow panoplyâtransfixedâimpaledâ (By gentle lovers of great nature's charms, Who injure and destroy her works by swarms) Outstretched on paperâwhere I think they please Far less than floating on the beam and breeze. But how can I e'er pin upon this page The still more restless Spirit of this Age? The Spirit of the Age?âI do it wrong, Ten thousand Spirits sure to it belong, Countless and crowded as the elves and fays, That fable lent to earth in elder days, Whose memory still upon our fancy plays, Or motes that in the shining sunbeams float, Which none can number, and which none can note; Black spirits and white are foundâred spirits and gray, That mingle, mingleâas they mingle may! Count on the opal's face the various hues, The tints that do the flowery beds suffuseâ The forest's leavesâthe desert's sandy grainsâ The ears of corn upon the harvest plainsâ The ocean's wavesâthe sun's gay glittering raysâ The lights and shades of wild autumnal days, But never hope to count by care or skill The Time's strange humoursâvarying, varying still; The multitudinous mockeries that engage The attention of this cultivated age; Oh! Age of harlequin transitions strange, Endless caprice, and everlasting change; Most glorious age of quicksilver and quacks, Of built up systems, and of burnt down stacks.â Machines for Calculation, quite complete, To save your brains and headâart's noblest feat! Machines infernal tooâdesigned no doubt To lop the head you do so well without! To blow away those useless brains inside, Whose place is now so perfectly supplied. Oh! age of patent blacking, and plate glass, Of vapourâpaperâsteamâdreamâgasâand brassâ (The latter article abounds indeed, So much that it might almost take the lead, And give the name of brazen to the age While all the war of impudence can wage!) Blest Age! with rarest mysticism deep dyed, And every other sort of schism beside; Sweet age of craniology and cant, I do not mean to infer by hint askant Or surmise, that the first hath with the last Undue connexionâthough together classed. The former's doubtless in its infancy, The latterânone can question sureâmust be Arrived at ripe, full-grown maturity. Oh! age of all-surpassing show, and sound Of pompous noveltiesâand names profoundâ Of mineralogyâand gene-alogyâ And every alogy, except an-alogyâ Of fair lithography, and other lies, And meteorology, that foils the wise. In shortâfor vain 'twere here the list to unfold,â Of ographies and ologies untold! Of magnetism, mobs, and masquerade, (Few seem what they by Nature's hand were made)â Of lath and plasterâleather and prunellaâ All things that need a far more able tellerâ Of AÃ«rostation, tooâwhich by the way Seems rather stationaryâso to say (And if it is, then 'tis the only thing That is soâfor the World's upon the wing); 'Tis endless movementâmovementâevermore,â Movement by day and nightâon sea and shore; Earth's face is battered, and her sides are shaken, 'Tis such a din the Dead will sure awaken.â Poor mother Earthâshe is ill used indeed; Upon this point we all must be agreed;â She's gashed and goredâand then in irons thrown, Harsh fetters, fixed, and fastened tightly down; While rail-road after rail-road is contrived, As Vulcan's self had on the earth arrived, With all his myrmidons to set up shop, Each brawny minister, each huge Cyclop; There's such a hammering, dinning, deafening, clattering, Thundering, and crashing, driving, riving, battering; And then the hurrying, hastening, crowding, chasing,â The scrambling, scurrying, rushing, running, racing, In all directions how they flock and fly, As Man's first Virtue were Velocity! It seemsâto look upon the stirring sceneâ As though our Planet's habitants had been Engaged in some dire breach o' the peace of lateâ (And 'tis the fashion now to agitate)â And as the Riot Act had just been read, And each one flew to save his own wise head. While, sternly stunned the factious and perverse, That signal word by all obeyedââDisperse!ââ So speed the scattered and the shouldering throng, Like breathless hunted fugitives along. What means the unpausing flightâthe unceasing race? Can no one stay one minute in one place? Is 't a concerted schemeâor is 't by chance That all are dancing such a dizzy dance? What fit hath seized upon the young and old, The soft, the stern,âthe bashful and the boldâ The gay and serious, and the great and smallâ What dire tarantula hath stung us all? Yet better the torpedo's touch would be, Than such extravagant activity. Perpetual motion was not made for man, In this his nether sphereâhis narrow span, While all around us raise so great a dust, And pant and push along, and shove and thrust, While each doth rove and range, return, retreat,â Lo! to stand still would seem a wondrous feat!â And to be stationary for a time, An action almost to be called sublime. 'Tis Stationary's self that fastest flies, Pen, ink, and paper, fleet before our eyes, While Poet, Playwright, Punster, Pamphleteer, The captious Critic with his freezing sneer,â CompilerâCommentatorâCasuist, tooâ Philologist, and Plagiarist, and Blue, The Historian with his high and towering themes, And the Antiquarian with his dubious dreamsâ And Traveller, Theorist, and Translator strive, Which can the fastest and the farthest drive In Learning's and in Fiction's paths of fame, To gain the sounding nothing of a name; Romancers, tooâ(and thousands are compressed In that one name, the briefest and the best).â All help to hurry on the thriving tradeâ All lend their little help, their petty aidâ While labouring, indefatigable still, Works day and night the o'er-wearied paper-millâ While flocks of wild geese in their flight are stopped, And of their dedicated plumage cropped. Then faster than they ever flew above, Those nibbed, flayed, sharpened plumes like lightning move; While speeds the manufacture of the streams, Designed to o'erflow and drown whole Realmsâno! Reams! Those maelstroom streams of all-absorbing ink, Which wellâif once drawn to their dangerous brinkâ Might sailing navies suckâand standing armies sink! Even scribblersâcareless scribblers such as I, Can bid apace the feathered pens to fly Like those swift wings that fledged fleet Mercury's heelâ (This trope is wrong when pens are made of steel)â The seas of ink in blackening tides to roll, Those seas that soon will spread from pole to pole!â Dark Delugeâwhose deep waves in sablest flow, Are spanned but by Invention's famed long bow! But that shall ne'er its dangerous influence pour O'er my plain pageâthat knows but Truth's blunt lore). E'en I can countless quires of paper blot, And deeply darken o'er their once fair lot, And give them to a dim and shadowy doom, And turn their whiteness to a sable gloom, And torture and torment them, âwhile the sweat Of their great agonyâ exudes in jet. But ah!âagain must I my fault confess, Again attempt these wild flights to repress.â I fell abruptly from the fields of Airâ For lately I careered triumphant thereâ Fell on the sullen, solid Earth at once, Giddy and blind, like many another dunceâ Fell like a stricken sparrow from a perch, And left my airy subject in the lurchâ Methinks I must have fallen a thousand feet, Were I to scan my verses in this sheet With nice attention and with narrow careâ (Which censors say I am apt to stint and spare)â Though not in one straight line, but many lines, Yet trust to pardon your kind heart inclines, All, gentle Reader!âwhile with rapid pace My wandering steps I now once more retraceâ Have I one-half of all the wonders named For which our very famous Age is famed? The inventions and improvements that aboundâ The marvels and the mysteries that are foundâ Where'er we cast our wondering wandering eyes, While in succession endless they arise; No! and almost impossible it were To sum up theseâto speak them and declare, Ere I have number'd but a portion o'er, I feel bewildered by fresh myriads more; Swarm springs from swarm, and score succeeds to score, A heterogeneous, multifarious mass, That doth with dazzling, puzzling fleetness passâ A strange confusionâa chaotic show, That ever seems to spread, and wax, and grow. Oh! Age of slackened yokesâbut shortened reigns! Of Punic faithsâand of BÅotian brains; Corinthian foreheadsâSybaritish creedsâ Long-winded words, and Liliputian deedsâ All mixtures and all medleys meet in thee, Legion thy nameâthy dress must motley be. Proud Age of Propagandismâand Patties!â What science, say!âis more improved than that is? Great Cookery's Science! that must interest all, Since Man is markedâa Cooking Animal!â Consistent, liberal, and enlightened France! (That show'st all Nations how to dress and dance; Exportest revolutions, pirouettes, modes, Or picked echantillons of these choice goodsâ Teachest the best constructions of sage codes, As well as the sublimest cut of coats, Also sometimes, too, the neatest cut of throats; And most refined and fashionable way, Our fellow-creatures or to maim or slay;) 'Tis Thou who sendest those legioned armies forth Of skilful artists, East, West, South, and North; Armies that 'stead of causing waste and want, Make the supply of victual their chief vaunt; That spread thy great and glorious fame afar Armies that yet have nought to do with War! Nay! that no doubt conduce to full-fed Peace, Though rivals to the far famed Hosts of Greece! Soft savoury fumesânot sulphurous blasts attend Their prosperous march, as forth their steps they bendâ Their quiet progress as they onwards wend! No desperate deeds their fair renown can soil, Though prone to seize the spoil and breed the broil; For ever constitutionally bent, With zealous care, and with sublime intent, All Europe's Constitutions to improve, And all corrupt abuses to remove; To give to thousands blessings erst unknown, (Which fair Gastronomy proclaims her own) The enlightened entremet, the sauce refined, To exalt the frame as knowledge doth the mind; Their apparatus emulates the fame Medea's kettle once was wont to claim. (What though you bathe not 'mid the savoury steam, Ask yon rapt Epicure what transports teem Through all his renovated frame inspired,â And with fresh thrilling ardours fraught and fired; When first auspicious gales around him waft, From the Enchanter's cave rich odours soft; And call forth feelings fond as those of youth, And haply more ingenuous in their truth;) And thus they visit distant nations still, To lend them all the advantage of their skill; To amend their courses, and to improve their tastes, And work a bright Reformâin their repasts. This is the Age of ceaseless stir and toil, (There is no pause unto the cark and coil) Of countless projectsâpropositionsâplans, Of loaded waggons, barges, coaches, vans, And cargoed ships thronged close, like clustered swans; Of clacking mills for ever going round, Of cumbrous engines plied with thundering sound, Of curious tunnels of construction rare, Of huge suspension-bridges hung in air, Of spinning Jennies and of squeaking Jacks, Of burthened asses and belaboured hacks, Of slackened bridles and of sharpened goads, Of beaten pavements and of battered roads, Of wheels, and weights, and wires, and springs, and screws, Of pulleys, paddles, presses, valves, and flues, Of bellows, and of boilers, and balloons, And barrel organs with their bothering tunes, Of hammers, clappers, rammers, flappers, flails, And clattering omnibuses, cabs, and mails; Also of every manner of machine That can be brought upon the stirring scene, Of all things busy, wondrous, restless, loud, Till not a moment's respite is allowed, And while we sow and spin, grind, build, and ploughâ Poor Time is really to be pitied now, He is so much employed!âI doubt 'tis true, He hath more to manage than he well can do. His forelockâOpportunity, indeedâ By which we are taught to take him at full speedâ That forelock all contrive to claw and pull, Until it scarce adheres to his poor skull. Always near bald, he is now half scalped beside, And needs a perriwig his plight to hide;â Also he'll grow asthmatic, broken-winded, And by the dust he raises be half blinded, Wing-sore and dizzy with his headlong race, And quite unequal to preserve his paceâ If flogged thus most unmercifully on, Till all his strength is spentâhis breath is gone. The rosy-bosomed, rosy-fingered Hours, No more may lightly tread on scattered flowers; Those rosy-fingered Hours grow grey and lean, They're so hard worked, with scarce a rest between, They are withered, wrinkled, worn, and bent, and bowed, For scarce one needful holiday's allowed. Or if, indeed, they have one now and then, Full soon they're called to go to work again, Ere they have time to turn themselves quite round, Again unto the wearying task they are bound. Pure age of patriotsâand pick-pockets tooâ (What those design, perhaps these may but do). These latter gentry are too harshly used, And somewhat inconsistently abusedâ To love their neighbours as themselves, they're bound, And do but stretch the sense beyond the sound, And love their neighbour's goods, too, as their own, Nor rest until their warm affection's shown. Great age of HomÅopathists, too, that seem Of Esculapius now the heirs supreme; Hygeia's chosen ministers, that twine Fresh garlands for her fair and golden shrine. Also of doctrines new, y'cleped Malthusianâ Can aught appear less like to a delusion? In short, of all things practical and plain, And rational and simple, sound and sane. As for that poor ghost Glory, once so prized, 'Tis now, it seems, expelled and exorcised; Such foolish, unsubstantial dreams must fade In the bright blaze of knowledge now displayed. The ancient banners now are dimmed with dust, The swords of belted knighthood dulled with rust. Then let the Oaks, while still improvement spreads, Bow down the hoary honours of their heads; Then let them meeklier bend above the plain, Razed be the records of their billowy reign, Forget their ancient triumphs on the main. Time was, a thousand fell to build up fair A glorious Queen of Ocean and the War, Our thunder-bearing armaments of pride, Our bannered fleets, that o'er the ocean ride Like floating pyramids, with outstretched sails, And tapering masts, whose point the strained eye fails To mark against the blue sky, bright and clear, As speeds the vessel on its swift career, The Utilitarian and the Economist Deem, doubtless, should be scratched from out the list,â The full list of the State's expenditure, Superfluous in the Utopias bright and pureâ Born, bred, (and buried) in their sapient brainâ Fain would they thin their numbers on the mainâ And think your frigates and your seventy-fours Should never have been launched from the English shores; And deem those barks of proud materials framed, Reft from the forests long by man unclaimedâ From the old woods of shadowy ages borne, That deepened midnight, and that darkened morn; Of timber and of fuel but a waste, And much upon that Element misplaced! Save only in fair Commerce' service now, Would they the âdeep and dark blue oceanâ ploughâ But how long would our glorious land maintain Her proud supremacy upon the main, Did not the thundering cannon of her ships Speak âVictoryâ from their adamantine lips? Her vessels hover, like winged genii, round To guard their queen, with mightiest empire crown'd. But I forgetâin this progressing time Supremacy is counted but a crimeâ Equality for nations, as for men,â Be this the darling theme of tongue and pen! Doubtless the air, the earth, the liberal light, Are every breathing creature's certain right. And can it be contested or gainsayed, That also in its ample sweep was made, Far as the thought can reach, the eye can scan, The Universal Main for Universal Man! Nor let the oak indignantly complain, And grieve o'er these restrictions of its reign, (It yet o'ershadoweth far the checquered ground, And casts its deep rich emerald tints around, Still flourishes as verdant midst the sceneâ 'Tis we ourselves that are not quite so green.) The long-sung laurel, as we late have shown, Views its fair triumphs lostâits glories flown; Those leaves that wreathed the imperial diadem, More precious far than costliest gold and gem,â That clasped a CÃ¦sar's godlike forehead round, And many a conqueror's brow victorious bound; Whose chaplet urged the intrepid warrior on, Until the prize was graspedâthe treasure wonâ The priceless treasureâthe immortal prize, The first and fairest in a hero's eyesâ Those leaves are now but laurel leaves again, (And yet as evergreens some charms retain)â Those leaves are now but laurel leaves once more, And all their glory and their pride is o'erâ Unwreathe the Demi-god's imperial crest, And let these leaves, no longer pleached, be pressed; With care extract the inly-circling juice, And mark its secret properties and use; Those glossy garlands have a virtue hid Their clustering foliage' shadowy pride amid. Now let them to the important test be brought, Lo! see the wonders in a moment wroughtâ A mighty change hath o'er their fortunes come, Dragged from the immortal dedicated domeâ Torn from the Temple of the God of Wars, The thunderer of the earth, the all dreadful Mars, Behold them thus condemned at once to fallâ Now dedicate to Apothecaries Hall! The Faculty adopt them for their own, And all their latent usefulness is shown, No more to bind the immedicable wound With Glory's empty charmâa breathâa soundâ But to be now medicinally used, With skill administeredâwith care infused! The smug apprentice now may wreathe his brows With those immortal and transcendant boughs; (Perhaps, though not on Battle's sanguined plain, The youthful hero boasts his hosts of slainâ Experienced in the gloomy work of Death, Perhaps he treads too on Destruction's path!) The knight of brandished spoon, and balmy still, The smoothing spatulaâthe soothing squillâ The phial, and the potion, and the pill, The pestle and the mortarâhe, even he, May pluck the leaves of Daphne's deathless tree! Yet not to him alone may be confined Those chaplets, wont the warriors' brows to bind, Degraded now from that triumphal arch, Where they hung nodding o'er the tromp-timed march, And from the proudly-bannered trophied tent, Where they in broad festoons were greenly bent. Although a medicine they in sooth may make, They also lend new flavour to a cake; A poison or a liqueur too prepareâ There's a distinctionâbut slight difference there, (For shrewdly to suspect I feel inclined They are cousins germane, of one stock and kind;) So, if you'd seek them in a fresh disguise, You'll haply meet them, veiled from careless eyes, In the confectioner's odoriferous shop, 'Chance placed 'twixt liquorice and lollypop. My knowledge of such things is very slight, And no receipt-book's near to set me right, Therefore forgive me if I now forbear With nice precision duly to declare The exact position in which may be found Of these proud leaves, so honoured, so renowned, The disembodied essence!âI am told, Yet know not, if the story's truth may hold, That oft they may be found where, better still, Less famed ingredients would their places fillâ The apricot's smooth kernels, sweet and white, Or peach-stone kernels, not so perfect quite. But shall we mourn above their altered state, And wear the willow for the laurel's fate, And uselessly deplore their present case, Still bent their ancient glories to retrace? No! let us smile away the airy dream, Let those who like it, when they've quaffed the streamâ Oft sloe-leaf juiceâby courtesy called teaâ Then peaceful sip their peaceful ratafia! But yet 'tis vain to doubt it or denyâ We sometimes cast a fond reverted eye Back to the dreams and deeds too of our sires, And glow a moment with congenial firesâ And grieve a moment o'er the broken spell Which once all hearts confessed so fondly well And sadden o'er that grove of glory, shornâ Stripped of its dignitiesâabasedâforlornâ The Evergreen hath fallen, in period brief, Into its fortune's sere and yellow leaf; Yet still Apollo should his sanction lend, And bless the lofty laurel and befriend, Yea! still should Medicine's God the patron be Of that degraded and deserted treeâ Since he who slew the Python with his dart, Is likewise Master of the healing art. He who the Chariot of the Sun commands, Also the use of Medicine understands; He who the rapt and fervent bard adores, Protects the Pharmacopolist's choice stores, And drugs and rhymes confess his radiant sway, And owe allegiance to the God of day. The Poet and Practitioner agree, Oh! bright-locked PhÅbus, in adoring thee; The drama and the draught, the oil and ode, Boast great Apollo as their patron-god. Still the bay tree and all its leaves grow sere, More at a discount each succeeding year; Tea leavesâtobacco leavesâthe cotton tree, May now exulting claim Precedency, (Save as regards its pure extracted dewâ 'Tis only prized in that one point of view!) Sandal woodârose woodâevery branch of trade, Of far more great importance now are made. Ask at our busy marts, our crowded ports, Fair Commerce' haunts and Business' crammed resorts; Ask in our manufacturing districts all, (Where none are freed from busy Mammon's thrall.) One answer will your strict enquiries greet, One certain truth all voices will repeatâ These are the days of money-making cares, Of bonds, and notes, and bills, and loans, and shares; Of speculations and monopoliesâ Subscriptionsâcompetitionsâschemesâsuppliesâ As for the dream of Glory, weak and vain, That cannot now delude men's minds again; All have one fixed pursuit, one dear intent, All on one object are profoundly bent, The lining of the Pocket and the Purse; To all besides this age seems much averse. What is the Victor's medalâwhat but trash? Compared with witching, wonder-working cash? What is the Conqueror's chariot and his crown To change or notes paid regularly down? What his proud arch, his pillar, and his scroll, His Royal banner, and his blazoned roll; His glittering orders and his laurelled name, His vain distinctions and his empty fame; What to the jingling, glittering, smiling coin, Prosperity's exhaustless, boundless mine; Why, what indeed?â'tis ready money still, That gives us all thingsâany thing we will. With that compared all else is worthless chaff; That is Aladdin's lamp, and Prospero's staff, Minerva's Ã¦gis, and Medea's charms, Apollo's arrow, and Achilles' arms. What is there seen by eye, or known to thought, That may not now by mighty gold be bought? Glory and honour, triumph, greatness, fame, The World's applauding shoutâa deathless name, The Critics' admiration and their praise, Aye! even the once much prized, much honour'd bays! Give but an ample and sufficient bribe, And you secure the whole impartial tribe. Well may the barren tree of Glory's field At once its influence lose, its triumphs yield; Then let the Oak submit too, to his fate, Since he is overlooked and out of date. Lo! even the Birch may lord it now above The ancient Monarch of the British grove. (The Birchâthat mighty chastener and sworn foe Of all the dull, the heedless, and the slow; The scourge of idler, dunce, and wayward rogue), Since now the Schoolmaster's so much in vogue, Since now the Schoolmaster exerts such sway, And doth a part so great and glorious play, And waves his twig-bound sceptre far and wide, Whose branching honours spread on every sideâ While myriads tremble at the enforced appeal, Which they are doomed, oft keenly too, to feel. One word, too, to the high and haughty Pine, As arrogant and boastful in its line, Still proudly soaring from its mountain bed, And lifting free its bold ambitious head, Almost as though it felt already there, The appended streamer floating in the airâ As though it towering and commanding stood, A stately mast o'er Ocean's foam-streaked flood, As though already in its pillared pride It shot in glorious height above the tide, Whileâas right onwards rode the bounding bark Free from its headâhigh soaring as the lark Flew that fair streamer in its lofty grace, As 'twere rejoicing in its pride of place; But it must learn to lessen and to lower Its bold claims nowâforgetting thus to tower, Pine-tree and fir shall now more humbly bend, (A deal of pride doth with their firmness blend), If not, they'll fall uprooted in the storm, Since they require a Radical Reform. And if men look beneath Earth's faceâeven there May much be found to claim their generous care. The DiamondâSay, pray what can be its right To shame all other Stones, supremely bright, And make, as 'twere, monopoly of light? He glistens and he glowsâa flashy spark, While his poor brother Charcoal, dim and dark, Is all begrimed, and lustreless, and sad, Like some smutched chimney-sweeper, coarsely clad. (Why doth it blaze out in such bright array? What better is't than other dust and clay, Or wood or stoneâor any thing beside? 'Tis time to mortify such maudlin pride.) As for the charcoal, though we cannot trace A likeness in its dull and dingy face To that proud gem that must attract all eyes, The monarch's portion and the merchant's prize. (This seems a bathosâyet it is not so, Ask but of those who have best right to know, Whether in these days there are no such things As merchants greater than the greatest kings? If Mammon makes the manâif Mammon gives The noblest life in which a mortal livesâ If Mammon raises himârefinesârenews, With the Supreme Elixir which he brews!) Yet he belongs, 'tis said, to the same race, Perchance the poor ill-fated charcoal's case Is but a younger brother's after all, To whom no portion of good things may fallâ And all the unjust contrivance is, be sure, A kind of natural Primogeniture. The diamond doubtless hath, which is not fair, The sparkling shiners all to his own share, The coat of many colours is his own, And Nature's partial tenderness is shown! No wonder he affects a pomp undueâ No wonder that he grows hard hearted too! But let the diamonds, in vain splendour dight, Tremble through all their frame of trembling light, Such glittering toys this polished age will scorn, And leave them in unpolished plight forlorn, In sad and solitary gloom to pine, Lost and neglected in their native mine. Turn to the living world a little space, Ah! much is there of wrong, and vile, and base, Much that must wound the Liberal's noble heart, And make his inmost bosom ache and smart. There, there are grievancesâabusesâwrongsâ Which ask for folio volumesâfluent tonguesâ For pure and practised handsâand Argus eyes, And zealous counsels, learned, and deep, and wise. And man, I fear, is slightly here to blame, I say it with deep sorrow and much shame, But still I doubt he is apt to entertainâ I dwell on this with true concern and pain, Strange partialitiesâaversions too, And stubborn prejudices not a few. This class of creatures wins his kind regard, While that he loathes, which seems unjust and hard. He pets with fondling care his favourite dog, But turns from speckled toad and croaking frog; The one wins all his tenderness and trust, The other's made his by-word of disgust. He treats his horse as fashioned for his use, His assâas only made for his abuse. This he with patronizing zeal befriends, To that but injuries and reproach extends. How ill are usedâOh! hear their moving taleâ The scaly people in Creation's scale; Shut out from all improvement and all knowledge (For who can found in the under seas a college?) Their education is neglected quite, And their best interests are kept out of sight. We've heard of learned and enlightened pigsâ Four-footed pedantsâtailed and snouted prigs, Instructed well in several kinds of loreâ (I own I love not a pedantic bore). These doubtless were (to school when duly brought) Upon the Hamiltonian system taught, And deeply versed as soon as they could gruntâ (I do not mean their boar-ships to affront)â At their first entrance on Life's crowdedâsty, In the Baconian philosophy, Condemned full soon to have the azure hose Drawn on their innocent young pettitoes; The boaresses themselves shall con the page The accomplished Liter-ati of the age! We have heard, too, of grimalkins, who have acquired Polite accomplishments by all admired; That have a mighty store of knowledge reaped, Up to the whiskers in their learning steeped; But who e'er heard of herring yet, or haddock, That could discern a steeple from a shaddock; That could distinguish, with observant eyeâ However they might be induced to tryâ Some old sea monster's salted, pickled bone, Even from their near relation'sâor their own? No! for these poor, degraded dunces yet, They have not so much as learned their alphabet. As far as A, B, C, they may progress, But never will arrive at F.R.S.â Never will go so far as to Ex-cel, Till blank De-cay the O-ce-an world shall quell. Our own domestic animals, perchance, May, as their Masters march, in time advance; But for the sea-fish, also the fresh-water, Their portion still is Ignorance, âNight's daughter.â No scrolls for them unfold, no maps expand, The tree of knowledge grows but on the Land! But, till its mighty roots far-spreading creep, Deeply to fix themselves within the Deep, We must confess, howe'er against our will, That knowledge is but superficial still. But let it now those depths of ocean sound, And prove in every sense, indeed profound, The Schoolmaster's abroad, is all the cry. Now let his lessons be no longer dry; Now let him take his fortune at high tide, Nor rest upon his oars, nor deign to glide, Only where smoothest currents flow along; He still should try the head-long and head-strong. Methinks 'twould seem he is not wont to fear To go beyond his depth,âwhy pause, then, here? No; let him plunge at once head-foremost down, We cannot think that he was born to drown, And seek the ancient realms of the azure god, Whose trident shall be vailed before his rod. And if old Neptune, throned on ooze and slime (Let me not spare the rod, and spoil the rhyme), Should prove refractory, or sneer, or nod, He may be taught to tremble at the rod. Since first rude Boreas, harsh and howling rose, He hath been well accustomed unto blows. Besides, would he arrange the matter well, He might descend to where the Nereids dwellâ Not in a bucket, but in diving bell; Then teach and preach through all the watery city, And if he ne'er returns, the more's the pity. Let not his hopes in the great deep be damped, His energies submerged, his projects swamped. The breakers need not cost him any trouble, He is used to froth, to noise, and to a bubble, And likes, while foreign tongues, he is apt to quote, To feel the flowing liquids in his throat; In short, if he the proper method try, He is sure to go on well and swimmingly, His craft so noble, and his drift so steady, Himself so used besides to currents heady. His projects divers,âand his subjects boys, (Though full-grown candidates for Learning's joys, Now far and wide impatiently aspire, While glow with keen Ambition's restless fireâ Hurrying to school grey Grandam and Grandsire;) His schemes afloat, his hopes a soaring train, His zeal enkindling evermoreâa-main, His ardour still unquenched,âhe shall not sink, Though sea and sky to him look black as ink; 'Gainst wind and tide, should he be strong to pull, So competent to manage wellâthe scull. The poor illiterate fishesâcould they know How much their fellow-creatures they are below, How very much beneath the rest they are; How they would ope their silly eyes and stare. Alas! their gloomy darkness is profound, For them no lights are litâno books are bound; No press is sanctioned, and no pens are slit, No schools are 'stablished, and no works are writ, No themes are classed, no treatises composed, No tracts distributed, no truths disclosed, To inform their minds, their fancies, too, to hit, No tomes are penned of wisdom or of wit. They never hang transfixed on some smooth line, Bating, when, Hook! they meet with points of thine. They have no freedom of Electionâno! Although from pole to pole they are free to go. They have no public meetingsânoneâthe sinners! Nor give, although they furnish public dinners; They are never on their legs, they have no bills, No clause have they, they have nothing but their gills. No candidates ambitious seem to obtain Their favour, nor their kind regards to gain; Nor to the interior of their hidden state E'er show the slightest wish to penetrate, (Perchance, because, though they might not be spurned, They doubt they ne'er would be by them returned!) 'Mongst us they are infamously represented; 'Tis their great Duty to be discontented! The Sea might seem to be, oh! shame and sorrow! But little better than a rotten borough. Corruption certainly doth there go on, And all know well how fish are to be won. And by what baits most likely to be caught, Each has his price too,âall are to be bought. Surely while petty Fins-bury even is free, That mightier Finsbury,âthe fish peopled sea, Should boast a privileged Constituency, But fishes are as I have said before, Sucked down at sea, quite swallowed up on shore! That Captain Cook who sailed so often o'er them, It was not to instruct them, nor to explore them. And all the Cooks who have come after him, Have made sad work for all the fish that swim! What do they do but slay them, weigh them, try them, Scale them and scald them, crimp them, flay them, fry them? True, Natural History may inform us well Of those poor natives of the scale and shell, But though we prize them and their merits own, Too oft our sympathies are strangely shown! And though we study, through their various maze, The different habits, manners, uses, ways Of these thronged tribes of the Ocean's teeming wastes, We think meanwhile, far more of our own tastes! And serve them in a very saucy way, (While firstly we tre-pan them, then be-tray)â And take with them a prompt and speedy course, By which we seal their fate without remorse. And will no liberal member make a motion, To benefit the inhabitants of Ocean? Will none now take them, under their protection? Then let them rise in floundering Insurrection! And nobly seek their dormant claims to urge, And prove the fierce insurgents of the surge; If we advance them not in Being's Scale, Shall the whale be content but to be-wail? To blubber and to blow his mighty nose, Nor lay a train to o'erwhelm his hated foes? (Ah! now for these he but train-oil provides, And leaves his very bones for them besides.) No! he will spout at once whole columns forth, And shed sedition East, West, South, and North! (And deeply 'mid his own reflections dash, Nor check his fearful taleânor spare the lash.) If there be no reporters near to write The strong out-pourings of his vengeful spite, Yet we need surely entertain no fear, But that all those who go to sea will hear. The watery world will quake with quick e-motion, And he shall nobly agitate the Ocean! So shall he soon his uproused comrades warm, Nor throw cold water on the plans they form; So shall he revolutionize the sea, The greatest champion of bright Liberty. What! shall the long scorned Sturgeon, Salmon, Shark, Be satisfied to flounder in the dark? And, from his place long banished, shall the Plaice, Like a true flat fish, aid his own disgrace? Sayâshall the Seal with slaves and minions mix, And thus the seal to his own ruin fix? Sayâshall the Sword-fish hide within the deep, Nor forth in flashing ire indignant leap, Shall they forsake the path the hero treads? And sayâshall the Oysters die too in their beds?â In stupid dulness long consent to dwell, Closed in the locked up chamber of their shell? (Save we burglariously dare to break Through the rough walls, and our forced entrance make, With ruthless hand that splits their sacred roof, 'Gainst all but man's unfair intrusion proof.) Shall Soles consent thus soulless to survive, Nor for their liberties and birthrights strive? Will not the Dog-fish doggedly refuse To endure that yoke which must so sorely bruise? And will not the crustaceous fish become More crusty, bound to so unjust a doom? The crawling crabs more cross and crabbed grow, Nay, lean to war, and ever as they go Look slant and sideways on the hated foe? And if in truth all justice be denied, Trace many a Machiavelian path aside, And indirectly thus their efforts aid, Who seek the oppressor's dreaded power to evadeâ And though they scarce can regularly join In great Improvement's forward march, their line May suit themselves far betterâtheirs may be A natural, though a crooked policy. All, all will blend in union firm and strong, A close, compact, indissoluble throngâ (They surely are not of the melting mood, Since they so long have dwelt within the flood.) And ye have cause, ye nations of the Wave, To rise 'gainst those who injure and enslave; Deep wrongs like yours must not go unrepaid, Or tyranny will flourish undismayed. Riseârise, ye children of the billowy brine, Take your own path, though we may cross your lineâ Ye have been long kept underâbut away, If once ye riseâye then must gain the day! The old veteran warriors of the by past war Are now a straitened few, and scattered far; And we are credibly informed the new Can never flesh their swords, ye fish, on you! RiseâOcean-monsters, rise! and ye small imps, Ye simple shoals of sprats, and smelts, and shrimpsâ Rise oneârise allâand wage a finny war, Can matters well be worse than now they are? Rise oneârise allâa vast and mighty host, That yet can make no strength of arms their boast, Being, in fact, without themâas we know, Though some possess a formidable row, Of sharpened weapons, that might daunt the foe! Some bear upon their backs a ponderous shield, Beneath which they are perfectly coneealed; ('Tis on their backs, with sorrow I repeat, Since this smacks much of flight and of retreat) And yet of flying fish not oft we hear, And therefore should suppress the ready sneer. But rise, ye slumb'ring nations of the Deep, Arouse ye from your dull lethargic sleep, And show the Earth, that ye of the Ocean are The very muscles and the soul of war. But till the above required results take place, I pity much the piscatorial race. Amongst themselves there is need too of reforms, They have their social breezes, civil storms; Poor things, no wonder they have nought else to do. But when we have contrived to make them blue, Things will, no doubt, a new complexion wear, A better colour, and a brighter, bear! Then the belle lettres, the charming and sublime, Shall far more worthily employ their time! The classic authors shall delight their leisure, And yield them all, profound and speechless pleasure. The Blue Seas then, the Black, White, Red, or Green, Shall view a different and far happier scene. The sharks and dolphins shall together play, Together float in learning's peaceful way; The kraken and the cod shall then combined, With zeal promote the noble March of Mind; The ignorant shall then forbear to assail Those who are clad in Wisdom's solid mail; The Illiberal shall be rigorously taught To honour, then, the Enlightened as they ought. Nor shall the idlers scorn, with puffed up notion, The poor industrious Operatives of Ocean, The builder-worms, that patient, year by year, The wondrous island structure firmly rear; The humble working classes of the Main, That ceaseless toil, yet not for hire or gain; That labour hard, unpausing, evermore, Until their labour and their life are o'er. Alas! at present countless wrongs are found 'Mid those deep waters which we may not sound; There, there, we are told, for vanity or victual, The great for ever prey upon the little. But let them now in tender bonds entwine, Leviathan shall with the minnows join, In close fraternity and kindly ties, Nor vulgarly presume upon his size! 'Tis but by accident he is of that class Which boasts so huge a bulk, so vast a mass; And he should verily lament and mourn That to such broad distinctions he is born. Rather than triumph in the chance which thus Gave him a station so conspicuous. But we must now unwillingly leave these To the great Lethe of the unsounded seas, And cast a look on things more known and near, Where e'er may Evil's cloven hoof appear; Turn to the tribes that ply the buzzing wing, That bear the fairy Suckerâthe fine stingâ The little, lightsome natives of the air, Which daily we behold disporting there; Let's hope, amongst the industrious, sober bees, (Or in our Gardens or their wild-wood trees), Let's fondly hope, it shortly will be seen They have taken measures to depose their Queen, 'Tis such a blot upon their busy lives, That they must have a Sovereign in their hives. Oh! they must soon, or each prove Freedom's Martyr, Possess their 'stablished Constitutional Charter! If they a pattern, prudently demand, Let them look round themâplenty are at hand, (The Spanish I would scarcely recommend, Because it breeds fresh troubles without end; Nor yet would I advise the Portugueseâ Dark, blood-stained quarrels seem to arise from these; Likewise the French undoubtedly appears To be the spring of sanguinary tears.) Then let the bees, when in revolt they rise, A good and just one for themselves devise, Then shall they wax far greater when they are free, And taste the enduring sweets of Liberty. Oh! let them join now in their common cause, And frame a combâI mean a code of laws; Then turn their lingering, lumbering drones adrift For their own livelihoods to make a shift. I have heard it hintedâmay it prove untrue, That 'mongst the Antsâa busy nation too, Such things are known and suffered, shame and grief, As a director, master, ruler, chief, That they no expedition undertake, No wise improvement e'er attempt to make, Without a chosen Leader to conduct, To teach the way, to enlighten and instruct, That they've their labourers too, and lower classes, (Who e'er could think that ants would be such asses?) And that within their little social state, Inferiors and dependants watch and wait, Surely these mournful truths but serve to show How far a bad example's force will go! It is our fault who long have led the way,â Long borne the abuse of Government and sway! Perhaps they have a House of Lordsâbeside Where doubtless swelled with ancestorial pride, The hereditary lawgivers would fain Spurn rude dictation and their rights maintain, And dare their real opinions to proclaim, Without a shade of dread or dream of shame!â A standing Army ready at a call, To plunge their foes, or keep themselves in thrall; Penal codes, press-gangs, pension-lists, poor rates, Pamphlets and Parliamentary debates; (Whose great redundance surely mostly springs From a confused and faulty state of things;) With Corporations they may saddled be, And tax collectors that must gall the free, They may have learned associations too, Logicians blusterous, and ladies blue, Critics censorious, and compilers cold, And tedious bores with tales three times retold. They may have speculations too, and schemes That burst like bubbles and depart like dreams; Perhaps they have their distant colonies Which cost in war or peace a fearful price, Also it may be a huge national debt, (The cause of all their ceaseless toil and fret), Fearfully heavy, desperately large, Which they are deeply anxious to discharge; (Oh! let them first discharge their hireling throng, Nor countenance so vile and foul a wrong, Yea, let them mend their practices ere long!) Perhaps they have ancient colleges and schools, With all their musty antiquated rules, Perhaps they have,âOh! crying ill of all, Which must most direly grieve and deeply gall, A rigorous, strong, constabulary force, Which checks sweet Freedom's riots in their course! So human do they truly seem to be Frail miniatures of our Humanity! So human are they in a thousand ways, Which fill the observer with profound amaze; But if they've common sense, (which we miscall, Since 'tis the most uncommon sense of all,) They now the first, the glorious part will play, And teach their human fellows thus the way, The great example they will nobly show, And lower the lofty ones and lift the low, And give Equality to all around, Then shall no evils in their state be found. How can we boast with vain and flighty words, That we are made and born creation's Lords, How dream that a superior stamp we bear, Since apes and ants mock both our acts and air? Since it, alas! is well known to be true That almost every thing we strive to do, Is better done by things we proudly scorn, And deem were solely for our service born! See, how the beaver builds, the silk-worm spins, The mole his way with nice precision wins, Through subterraneous galleries, finely wrought, With toil that tires him not, and costs him nought! The coral-worm uprears its wond'rous isle, And covers ocean many a spreading mile!â And though less startling, full of interest too, The spider spreads his labours to our view, Mark the light nautilus, the billows brave, The natural navigator of the wave; Behold the bee that plays the chemÃ­st's part, With skill unfaltering and consummate art! The Arabs, a brave people, bold and free, (Who boast, and justly, of their liberty, A fine, unfettered independent race,) Think little of precedence, pelf, or place, Yet have a most pernicious custom, which, I am told they carry to a dangerous pitch, While they themselves are simple, plain, and free, They strangely prize their courser's pedigree; And on that pedigree build all their pride, And on their haughty way rejoicing ride! Thus striving to their very beasts to teach Those hurtful maxims which we most impeach. But let the hardy, fearless Arab chief, Now, while 'tis time, turn over a new leaf, Nor aid the wrongs he loathesâdrawn far astray, But take a fairer, more straight-forward way, Nor turn the small head of his noble steed, By vain, fantastic boastings of his breed; Nor bid him trample down his fellow-brute, With step imperious and disdainful foot. Brave children of the desert! can ye care, Or for the inheritance of horse or mare, If they, indeed, are fleeter than the air? Oh! let the manes of their fathers rest, Nor let them rear on high a haughty crest; If they still take, like rushing winds, their way, What can they want with sixteen quarters, pray? If they with speed the trackless wilds can trace, What matter their forerunners in Life's race? Their herald should the flashing lightning be, The plane their only genealogic tree. If they've a shining coat of sleek, smooth pride, And legs of bounding vigour, proved and tried, What do they need a coat of arms beside? Oh! if by their main strength they can prevail, What boots a flourished, vain, heraldic tale? If they leave all behind them in their flight, What went before them's immaterial quite; If they can leap o'er each obstructing thing, It scarce can matter from what source they spring; And if their withers are unwrungâsay trueâ Imports it from what withered stock they grew? There doubtless is, I must with grief declare, Foul play amongst the fair fowls of the air. The monarch eagleâwhy should he pretend His feathered fellows should before him bend. Why should he plume himself with paltry pride, On being lord of the aÃ«ry regions wide? Or, with hooked beak, so high and haughty look, And rule the upper world by hook or crook. Let him a little from his height descendâ I only give this counsel as a friend. 'Mongst beasts as well as birds we sorrowing see The baleful system of supremacy; But not for very long can this endureâ 'Tis doomed to be subverted, I feel sure! The lordly Lion must his pride abate; His rugged throne must quickly abdicate!â That high and most majestic king of beasts, Who boasts purveyors for his royal feastsâ Is not the sharp and active jackall styled The noble brute's provider in the wild?â He now can have no caterer, carver, tasterâ Thus may despatch his dinner all the faster! E'en let him nowâ'twill be his wisest planâ Commence the quiet, country gentleman, Kill his own muttonâfurnish his own mealâ Chase his own venisonâcut up his own veal! That hoary-bearded patriarch, he must now The sovereign herd's triumphant claim avow; He must submit to our projected law, And walk with his brute subjects paw in paw, While all the glories of his former reign Fall from him like the dew-drops from his mane. Let him our will contentedly obey, And peacefully resign his ancient sway, And walk in quiet, with retractile claws, (For these are things that still should give him pause;) Though our proposed and most prodigious bill (To be drawn up with boundless care and skill), For Universal and Complete Reform,â A cause to make e'en rocks of ice grow warm!â Hath no retractile clause, but still is found Full armed to deal momentous changes round! He now must view his ancient state withdrawn, With none to pray, speak fair, sa-lam, or fawn. No more shall he his code despotic frame, Nor barbarously enforce his boastful claim! To our provisions he must now submit, And swallow whatsoe'er we may think fit. Yet he may trust usâliberal and discreetâ Nor fear but we will give him what is meet. His savage majesty must now, 'tis plain, Dismiss his proud and ostentatious train, Yield all his vain advantages, and then Retire in meek submission to his den;â Renounce his ill-advised pretentions quite, Nor dare defend presumptuously his right,â Renounce his hateful privileges all, And hail his equal in his own Jack-all! Even haughty man who still supreme looks down On all things with a lordly, lofty frown, Who, fired with conscious greatness towers erect, And claims from wide creation due respect; Even haughty man, when all this comes to pass, May find his fellow in his own Jack-ass! And now methinks 'tis time to set you free, Dear Reader, from my strain of Liberty; My rather tedious and protracted song, (I trust it carried you with it along;) Methought I caught, ere yet the strain was o'er, The murmurous echo of a muffled snore, Which fell with such a dulcet dying close, It must have breathed from an enlightened nose; Yet, if with patience you would kindly deign, Still courteously to hearken, I would fain Whisper some parting words within your ear,â Perhaps I am not just what I appear. Some slight confessions I have here to make, If you, indeed, are now quite broad awake, And willing for some moments, to attend, For truly, now my strain draws near its end; I own that I feel anxious ere we part, Although I know not, Reader, what thou art, That thou should'st better guess at what I am, For sooth to say, it suits me not to sham, The truth is this, (but I would have you know, I beg and wish it may no farther go; And take a strictly confidential tone, And breathe this for your private ear alone;)â The truth is this, I speak with all submission, Myself, I am nothing of a Politician! (Perchance you have discovered this before, And thought you had some little right to snore.) Like other parrots, I repeat by rote, Whate'er I hear, with closely copied note. To settled principles I lay small claim, My course I shape, my free opinions frameâ My creed political, I found and form, Much as a straw might do amid a storm! (Borne hither, thither, rapidly away, Unconscious of the least support or stay.) Or as a weed, swift carried down a stream, 'Midst thousand, petty, eddying waves, I deem! Or as a little, running, rain-swoln rill, Drawn down a steep declivity of hill. And now methinks that you at least must own, My secret self I have distinctly shown, Nor sought to cheat your penetrating eyes, By shrouding my defects in fair disguise; Yet, as times go, methinks that I may boast That my opinions are as good as most; As independent and original As many others, were truth told of all, As sound as even my neighbours, would they show Theirs but as openly to friend and foe! And therefore though by some I may be blamed, I think I have no cause to be ashamed. And let me also to your ear confide, That I have this advantage on my side, I can adopt full quickly for my own, Of others, both the opinions and the tone, Nor seek the merits of the case to learn, It costs me nothing to retract or turn; No sacrifice at all in this I make, And stillâfor know that I have nought at stakeâ The newest notions, strongest side I choose,â Give credit to the candour of my muse! But I outrun my limitsâto conclude, Man is already more than half renewed. Now, now, let Nature be reformed at last, Doubtless in her bright Prime, in the Elder Past, Things were far better ordered and arranged, Though now so much corrupted and so changed,â Different from things which now shocked Reason sees, Abuses will creep in by slow degrees, And 'tis our duty to abolish these; Then we must never fail to recollect Great Nature, once so fresh,âwith due respect,â Is now indeed an antiquated Dame, Decrepit, withered, with a worn out frame, Large wrinkles, ages have contrived to plough, Along her once serene and radiant brow, Perhaps she may be in her dotage too, Not quite aware of all that she may do; Aged, superannuated, gone to wreck, And needing many a wholesome hint and check! Shorn of her strength, and health, and fallen away Into her second childhood, bent and grey, The withered victim of a long decay! She may be now, o'er-worn with many cares, Unequal grown to rule her own affairs, And also ('tis most likely) worse and worse, May stubborn prove, opinionated, perverse, (As people rather elderly become, At least, no doubt, it is the case with some, When if you offer them the least advice, They frown, and quarrel with you in a trice!) But in these days of superfine invention, 'Twere best that she retired upon a pension; For doubtless, man, with equal skill and grace, Can well fill up her once important place; Even now in countries civilized, she seems, With her bowed woods, lowered hills, and tortured streams, (Disfigured on their mirrors and their marge, By mill, by towing-path, and bridge, and barge,) Her choaked-up plains, her intercepted views, Her clouded aspects, and her altered hues, In endless ways transfigured and disguisedâ Even now scarce seen in countries civilized! She is driven to corners, banished, hunted, hid, And called to account, and crossed, and check'd, and chid, Through buildings, artificial works, and smoke, We scarce can trace one old familiar look, One kindling feature undeformed, of her, Once prized by Poet and Philosopher. Of her, who in the fair world's earlier stage, Was the inspiration of the enraptured Sage, The Painter's idol, and the Dreamer's bliss; But then that age was most unlike to this. In the loud, busy, darksome, crowded town, Where frightful founderies flame, and factories frown, Who could with close and careful search, e'er find Aught that of her, or hers might once remind? She may be charming, and she may be fair, But wholly out of place would she be there! In short, each day brings ample evidence, That man can with her services dispense; And if you must with your own eyes behold The charms which sage and soaring bard have told, Go view the Opera's gay and gilded scene, The dazzling stage, the richly painted skreen, The Panorama's bright and blazing field, Where beauty after beauty is revealed; And the Exhibitions, with their paintings too, Representations, doubtless, chaste and true, At least abounding with bright red and blue, Yellow and scarlet, purple, orange, green, Which in profuse diversity are seen. If you are not right well content with these, Good worthy sir, you must be hard to please. In truth, those paintings, beautiful and bright, That rivet long the connoisseur's charmed sight, Are oft so rarely touched in every part, That Nature near them would appear like Art! Nay, I feel sure, where she by chance to call, She would not know herself therein at all! But when I said, some little time ago, Forgetful of the truths I ought to know, That our true interests now seemed to require That Nature on a Pension should retire, I own I fell into a strange mistake, (Surely I then could scarce be quite awake,) Since Pensions cannot now permitted be, By a discreet Reforming Ministry. Let merit or misfortune then beware, Nor dare to seek a balm or guerdon there. Pensions no more are to be given away, But kept for those who live on prey and pay. But the new Poor Law, to which all must bow, Is fairly come in operation now, And let the mighty Pauperâif, indeed, She be reduced, and should assistance needâ Apply for aid, and duly be received In some huge Union Workhouse and relieved; Though, if the accounts we read and hear be true,â (I cannot yet believe them halfâcan you?)â Far better had she, when her means grow scant, And lodging, medicine, clothes, she is doomed to want, And kindly service and sustaining cheer,â To her own howling deserts, wild and drear, With all convenient haste herself betake, Than for relief such application make; To parching Lybia's staring sterile plains, Uncooled, unwatered by refreshing rains;â Zahara's hideous nakedness of waste, Where any living thing would seem misplaced; Arabia's long, lone tracts of blinding sand, Where fields of boundless barrenness expand,â The untrodden gloomy regions unexplored, Where Earth was ne'er enjoyed nor Heaven adored; Where hateful reptiles house, foul monsters brood, And nothing seems to be of Fair or Good! And to their loneliest, dreariest haunts withdraw, Than trust the tender mercies of that Law! IfâI say ifâthose dire accounts be true, Which Pity's starting tears, that cloud the view, Permit not the eyes, o'erflowing, to read through; So full of misery, bitterness, and woe, That every tear seems keen as fire to flow! What Giant Spectre sternly stalks along, Close followed by a gaunt and ghastly throng, Than spectres more appalling to the view, With tear-stained cheeks of blue cadaverous hue, And with their faint limbs, quivering all the while, (Wrung by long years of labour, suffering, toil,) With weak convulsive life, and living pain, Which sheeted spectre ne'er shall know again; And with their dim eyes rolling in despair, And starting dews that bathe their matted hair, They groan, they sigh, they shriek, they weep, they wail, They tell with choking sobs their piteous tale, For pityâis't or pardon that they pray? What crimes can they have ere committedâsay? Their crime is to be poor, and to be oldâ A deadly crime, as our new statesmen hold. Their state was wont to meet with kind respect, Compassion, sympathyânot harsh neglect, Not barbarous, heartless cruelty. But now, All this is changedâReform knows why and how! Therefore be deaf to their distracted prayer, The aged wife from the aged husband tear; Trueâthey can live but by each other's sideâ But what of that? That prayer must be denied. One thing is sure, torment them as we list, The Poor and Old, we know, can ne'er resist. Therefore, be deaf, and vainly let them crave,â They will but sink the sooner to their grave, And save the parish some few precious pence; (Your true Reformers have such sound, strong sense, They look alone to stern utility, So long as they may not the sufferers be!) See how around the knees of that dread Thing In wild, convulsive agony they cling;â The aged, and the friendless, and the infirm, Whose earthly sorrows must be near their term. By all dear charitiesâall cherished tiesâ All Heaven doth sanctifyâall man can prizeâ All justice claimsâall mercy cravesâthey ask; But vain their tears, and hopeless is their task; It shakes them off, and scowling looks around, And every look doth, withering, pierce and wound. That dreadful form, that breathes not human breathâ What is't?âWhat is it like?âHalf Life, half Death. No blood seems in Its shrunken veins to flow, No vital energies within to glow; Its hideous hair of snakes hangs down in coils, To catch the wretched in its treacherous toils; Its icy mantle is spread open wide, To fold round those, the suppliants at its side,â That icy mantle which no warmth supplies, Whose weight like lead upon their shoulders liesâ Whose touch but chills the marrow in their bones;â Thus, when âthey cry for bread It gives them stones.â It seems a fearful visitant of wrath, That takes 'mid groans and sighs its destined path; A Proteus-Phantom, that all shapes assumes, Like changeful shadows seen 'mid twilight glooms; Now it less harsh, less terrible appears, Though still an aspect stern and dread it rearsâ Now seems to gaze with forward-looking eye, As if instinct with silent prophecy, Unto the distant but the coming days, Intent to work out good by desperate ways. Now 'tis a tyrant, of all tyrants worst, Most cold, most cowardly, cruel, and accursed, That picks its victims out with studious care From those that weakest and most helpless are; Then with a hypocritical pretence, Torments them with a doom of sad suspense, And keeps those shivering, whom it will not save, Between the sickly pallet and the grave. It holds within its bare and bony hand A shadowy cornucopia and dread wand; From this but garbage, dregs, and ashes fall, While that enjoins submission still to all. Its frightful train is such as may befit,â And Poor Law Bill is on its forehead writ. But Lo! the cries seem smothered by despair, They die away in low, faint murmurings there; No longer ringing and re-echoing round,â In leaden silence lie the sufferers bound. It is too muchâthe penance and the painâ Too much for Human Nature to sustain. Hold, ye oppressors, hold the ruthless arm; Ye whom no grief can touch, no pity warm! Whose heavy, cruel, and too skilful stroke, All love-bound links hath loosed, all bonds hath broke! Your law all laws, of Heaven and Earth deridesâ Avaunt! ye black, unhallowed parricides! For ye smite down with sacriligious hand The aged Fathers and grey Mothers of the Land! The Parents of our Populationâthose Whose heads are whitened o'er by countless snows, Who in past years with tender rapture pressed Their rosy offspring to their feeling breast, And in the luxury of Love's silence smiled Above the slumbers of the Heaven-sent childâ What time, enwrapped in deep and dreamless rest, The humble cradle held its infant guestâ Then watched from step to step their children rise, And alter e'en to their parental eyes, Till, fondly anxious for their darlings' fate, They long considered o'er their future state, Loath the beloved ones from their homes to lose, Yet eager for their cherished weal to choose, Then sent them forth to gain their honest breadâ Perchance in some industrious, peaceful trade, Or haply to take part in England's wars, To share her triumphs, and to wear her scars; Or lay the promising and youthful head On beaming Glory's red and reeking bed. Yet, if Heaven willed the poor man's child to spare, Hearingâfor Heaven will hear the poor man's prayerâ How deep the bliss that either heart confessed, While child and parent, in each other blest, Glowed with an honest pride, and joyed to dwell On tales that one would hearâthe other tell; Or they might choose for them a different doom, The labourer's mattockâthe mechanic's loom;â Their children, and their children's children too, Are those whom now in manhood's strength we view! The hoar Progenitors of the actual raceâ The present Generationâin their placeâ The Parents of the PeopleâHow provides Our Land for them?âYe iron-souled parricides, Whose law all earthly, heavenly laws derides! Ye deal to these their scant and slight supply, Which scarce or grants to live, or spares to die. What! Shall we leave them to their dire despairs? We, of the fruit of their long toils the heirs, And see them crushedâoppressed?âWhere am I?âWhere?â I wake to view these horrors melt in air! Starting, I wake, in wonder and amazeâ What hideous vision hath appalled my gaze?â What frightful dream hath visited my brain, For surely I have bowed to Morpheus' reign?â Surely it must have been a dream of woe; For can such horrors be endured below?â Or could it be reality, in sooth?â Oh! answerâCould it, could it then be truth?â Away!âlet whining Tories raise a rout Old women's wrongs and wretchedness about; A fellow-feeling makes them much inclined, No doubt, to pity these and to be kind!â We heed not if they sulk, or if they storm, We are all Reformers, and this is Reform. SONNET ON THE LAMENTED DEATH OF THE COUNTESS HOWE. Bright Excellence! translated to the Skies, We mourn thee with a true and tender woe; Yet should a Heavenly sweetness through it flow, Which from its Heavenly subject should arise! Thou walkedst with the Goodâthe Pureâthe Wiseâ The Meek and Humble-minded ones below. Now shall the Angelic Hosts their Sister know! Mount and receive on high thy palmy prize! Almost thou seemedstâand be these thoughts forgiven, Which will from Grief's luxuriant soil take birthâ So little tinctured with Sin's worldly leavenâ Blest with such bright perfection of rare worth,â Too dear to Earth to be yet spared to Heaven, Yet ah! too ripe for Heaven, to be retained on Earth! TO SILVIO PELLICO. Why, what is Liberty?âTo keep, like thee, The Soul unstained by fetters, and to pour High feelings forth, like bright waves to a shore, Unbarredâunboundedâeach itself a Sea! Oh! Victorâthus most nobly, proudly free When most entrammelled!âFree to feel, to adore, To build blest Visions in thy high heart's core; To be in Thought what thou in Truth shalt be, Ere many years have swept along the path Designed for them by Heaven. Upon his throne, Girt round with fear, and jealousy, and wrath, Is many a King less free than thou wert, lone In thy locked dungeon, since Prayer's mighty breath Dissolved thy chains, and Faith said still âhope on!â LINES. Oh! not alone is blood for blood Just Heaven's unchanged decree, But wrong for wrong, or good for good, Full oft ordained shall be. Suffering for sufferingâpang for pang, Thou yet may'st have to pay; While memories of old times shall hang Around thee night and day. Sufferings for sufferingsâstings for stings, False One! shall yet be thine; A Nation with thy proud Name rings, Thy heart shall ring with mine! Thy parasites may round thee crowd, And hear and see but thee; While thou shalt still, by conscience bowed, Seeâhearâbut only me. THE PASSION-LIGHTNINGS SEARED AND SCATHED TOO SOON. The Passion-lightnings seared and scathed too soon, My inmost being bared before their power; Then came cold, cold Indifference' frozen swoon, While yet my life was in its opening hour. Alas! the Pinions of my Thought too fast Once bore me upwardsâupwardsâfar and free; Then, all exhausted and o'erborne at last, How sunk they, shivering, in Life's swallowing sea! STANZAS. None can our heaviest, worst, of sorrows share, The Depths of our own souls are like to Death; We can take no fond, loved companion there, But lone must tread that silent, shadowy path. There we hear things that others cannot hear; There we see things that others may not see; New Worlds there opening to our gaze appear, New Worlds of Dream, and Cloud, and Mystery. Yes! we must tread those silent walks alone,â Even to ourselves is the undertaking hard! Ten thousand thousand shadows round them thrown, Our progress ever lingeringly retard. Maze within maze we there must ever find, More deepâmore complex still as we advance; Oh! the veiled depths of the quick Heart and Mind,â These are not looked through with one hasty glance! WAKING AT MIDNIGHT. Strange 'tis at Midnight's hour to wake From deep dreams of the Lostâthe Dead, And to feel the Old Times, wave-like, break Above the lowered and weigh'd-down head. Shapesâstepsâsmilesâvoicesâto recall Distinctlyâtill we scarce can deem That Life, with its wild changes all, Can be aught but a shadowy Dream! Then comes the Morning's smiling dawn, And Dreams are Dreams, and cheats again; And the pale Past is all withdrawn Into itselfâin dim Unreign! FAR AWAY!âLONG AGO! Far away!âlong ago! Sounds of sweetness and of woe. Where, my heart, are thy best treasures, Priceless hopes and hallowed pleasures? Far away!âoh! far away! Things of a long vanished day, When wert thou glad, chainless, free? Heart awake and answer me! Long agoâlong agoâ Ah! poor heart, thy life-drops flow In these fond tears that echo deep Those words that seem themselves to weep! Words of sad and searching might, To enchainâto troubleâand to smiteâ Words of sweetness and dismayâ Long ago!âfar away! Long ago!âfar away! Words of Passion and Dismay. When, my Soul, wert thou upspringing, Like the lark thy glad flight winging, From the gloom and care of Earthâ From its dulness and its dearth? Long agoâoh! long agoâ Ere the heavy days of woe! Where are thine own smiling dreams, Lighting Nature with their gleams? Far away!âfar away! Can young delights and winged dreams stay? Now, my soulâo'erwrought, oppressed, Thou must live a thing unblessed, Since thou'st learned those words of woe, Far away!âlong ago! I FLEW TO 'SCAPE FROM LOVE AND THEE. I flew to 'scape from Love and thee, I flew To Nature, rich in sunbeams, flowers, and dew, But where she was most beautifulâmost there She minded me of one yet far more fair. I bent o'er the Romancer's pictured page In hopes my sleepless sorrows to assuage, But each bright Being there recalled that One Yet brighter stillâwhom most I sought to shun. A distant pilgrimage I fondly planned, And turned my steps to many a lovely land, But each fair face I saw did but remind Of one, yet more than beauteousâleft behind. I soughtâin calm Religion's depths I sought A balm for every racked and wounded thought; Alas!âmay this be pardonedâcould it be That I should think of Heaven, and not of thee? MOUNTAINEER'S BATTLE SONG. Let their Battle-thunders roll! Can they daunt the mountain soul? A loftier sound is in our ears, The storm's voice; and our hearts it cheers! Who on the mountain's bosom dwells, Where oft the glorious tempest swells, Nor knows the kingly thunder's toneâ Its deafening crashâits lengthening groanâ That mighty anthem-harmony Which shakes the earth and thrills the sky! On the echoes soars the mountain soulâ Let their Battle-thunders roll! Let their spears glance to the sun! Nor these can dazeânor those can stun! Our ears are armed! our watchful eyes Are conversant with yon bright skies. Like the Persians of old time, The great hills are our shrines sublime! We have lived 'mid scenes of dread, We can die, when hope is dead! Still unshrinking and unscared, With our swords and bosoms bared! Freedom's light is match'd by noneâ Let their spears glance to the sun! Let their legions scale our heights; Deathâdeathâor freemen's rights! From the mountains to the skies 'Tis but one proud step! Arise! Meet the thousands of the foe, Let their arms and numbers go! They are ThousandsâWe are One, Let their spears glance to the sun! Let their Battle-thunders roll, Can they shake the mountain soul? For Religion and our Rights! Let their squadrons scale the heights! INEZ TO MANUEL. Should I have feared theeâwhen at first I met those glances more than bright? Should I a wise distrust have nursed? Or sought security in flight? Should I have trembled then and feared Because thou wert so matchless allâ Nor, like the foolish bird, have neared Those dangers that should most appal? 'Twere needlessâperfect as thou art Beyond all else that's born of dust, Had I but watched my wayward heart, And known its weakness to mistrust! Aye! perfect as thou artâI know That heartâso quickâso wild and warm, Alone could seal my misery soâ And 'gainst me Fate's worst Furies arm! Its dreams unchecked around thee cast A deep charm that was not thine own, And showered about thee, full and fast, A light that strangely-dazzling shone. Should I have feared thee thenâor fled, When first mine eyes were met by thine? No! 'tis mine own heart I should dread, While feeling and while life are mine! Had I but kept a watchful guard O'er that wild whirlwind-heart within, 'Twere wellâbut now, oh! now 'tis hardâ To striveâto struggleâto begin! But now the dreadful charm is wrought, And now, indeed, 'twere wise to fly From theeâfrom loveâfrom hopeâfrom thought To quit thy sideâto shun thine eye. Oh! now 'twere wiseâ'tis needful now Thy presenceâWorshipped One! to avoid, And still to keep that rigid vow Till Passion orâtill I'm destroyed! HUMAN LIFE. A darkness and a light, A silence and a sound, A weakness and a might, A vastness and a bound; Such, such is Human Life, With its contrasts and its change, With its trouble and its strife, Wild, startling, dim, and strange. A war withinâwithoutâ A hurryâa delayâ A certaintyâa doubtâ A slavery and a sway. A fulness and a void, A substance and a shade, Hour after hour destroyed By the progress it hath made. A whirlwind and a calm, An idlesse and a task, A poison and a balm, A vigil and a masque! Such, such is Human Life, Say, rather, Human Death!â 'Tis one agonyâone strifeâ From the first to last of breath!</field>
