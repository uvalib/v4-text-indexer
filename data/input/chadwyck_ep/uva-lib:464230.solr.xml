      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Syr Robert Sidney KNIGHT, LORD VICOVNT Lisle. When first I did thy Patronage implore, Promise and Loue the chiefe incentiues were, VVhich made me bold to set my skill before Your eie of iudgment: But now Loue with Feare VVils me to beg assistance from thy selfe, To saue my Barke from the VVorlds dangerous shelfe. I know not, I, what Pow're doth me constraine, (May be some heau'nly Influence doth moue) For now my Barke must launch into the Maine, O let her Pilot be (great LORD) thy Loue! And as thou grac'd her lying in the Docke, So steere her now aloofe from Enuies Rocke. Your Honors affectionate Seruant, Tho. VV. Vinum, &amp; Vinegrum. I neither hang out Bush nor Signe, t'inuite The commers by to taste, what VVine I sell: T'is new, but hard, the pallat to delight: Yet I haue often heard some others tell, That I haue VVine, some much more sweete then other: Beleeue them not, for they may be deceau'd, T'were better taste thy selfe, then trust an other: I passe not if thou taste, or taste not, so I leau't: It's that I made my selfe, t'was neuer bought, Many pay deare, for that's exceeding nought. THE Abortiue of an idle Houre. Scribimus indocti, doctiq; poemata passim. Ad Lectorem. Epigr. 1. Apologia pro Libello. The Epigrams which you shall read Sunt bona, sunt quædam mediocria, sunt mala plura, Quæ legis hic: aliter non fit Auite liber: Ep. Mar. Are some good, most part nought, Indifferent some; or else indeed A booke, no booke is thought. In Hermaphroditos Anglicanos. Ep. 2. The Virginibus Tyrijs mos est gestare pharetram. Virg. Tyrian maides in shooting tooke great pride, And always wore their quiuer by their side; Our Brittaine brutes, or rather Monster-dames, Whose necks are compass'd with hells yellowe flames, I must tell troth, though I be shent for blabbing, They were Steeletto's, for their prid's in stabbing. In Drusum. Ep. 3. VVhen Drusus waits vpon S?. George his day, He prays his friends not to molest him then, For then hee's not his owne man, doth he say, He's so imployd, as other Lordings men; The man's so farre for being then his owne, That Drusus and his clothes alike are knowne. In Leuem. Ep. 4. Leuis through much experience vnderstands Women haue cause to fancie falling?bands. In Monoculum. Ep. 5. VVe deem them craftie, which with one eye look; But I dare take my oath vpon—ne booke, Monoculus did nere deceiue his brother, Hee'd see with two eyes, if he had another. In Lenonem. Ep. 6. Leno protests it is not past foure yeares, Since shoe-tie-roses were in estimation; And he was one that had the first he swears, T'is like; for he loues still to be in fashion. But for his credit and the time, I'le add, He eight years since a paire of Non Rosæ mundae, Roses had. In Leuem. Ep. 7. I will not, Two negatiues make an affirmatiue. no, and that's as much as I, This phrase cost Leuis hir Virginitie. In Littletonicos. Ep. 8. An auncient tenure Cornage is ye know, And heretofore hath bin of more esteeme: Now horns in euery place so common grow, That men ridiculous this Tenure deeme; It summons them to dinnerBut Inns-of-Court-men should not Cornage scorne, For they are much behoulding to the Horne. In Thrasonem. Ep. 9. Thraso is loath, that his well-wishing friends Should see his courses, or know what he spends; Nouerint vniuersi.But when to borrow neede doth vrge him, then He stands not on't, Bee't knowne vnto all men. In Allum. Ep. 19. All us protests, that he can drinke no wine, He loues it not, t'will make his headpeece light; With ale or beere (sayth he) I'le rather dine, Than hurt my stomacke, or my wits afright. At wine his lipps shall not so much as smacke, But you may dayly make him drunke with sacke. In Quercium. Ep. 11. Qvercius turns ouer many Physicke bookes, But doth not practice, yet on water lookes; I haue not heard his physicke ere sau'd any, But once I heard, he would haue poysond many. In Lucifugum. Ep. 12. Lvcifugus was with a Ghost so haunted, That he thought euery place to be enchaunted; He could no soner moue him to one place, But still his Ghost had got before his face. Lucifugus ow'd mony to his host This was his night and day molesting G. De simulachro Thomæ Bodlëi equitis aurati, Bibliothecæ Oxoniensidicato. Ep. 13. Here may you see though Bodley but in part, Apollo's image and Lysippus art. To wishe for more then part of him were vaine, For all the earth cannot the Anima whole containe. In Orbicularem figuram mundi. Ep. 14. The world is round, we know, that liue therein, T'is round in compasse, and t'is round in sinne. In Magnasum. Ep. 15. Magnasus is a man of worthy race, His nose stands like a Screene before his face; Much worship did he lose of the last Queene, Because he could not for his nose be seene. I heare he hath of late receiu'd some grace, His Nose it seemes, was in some other place. In Thrasonem. Ep. 16. Thraso looks big, and mak's his cheeks seeme ten, As if he would out-face an host of men: The flesh, the deuill, and the world, I know He cannot conquer, though he puffeth so. In Dronum. Ep. 17. VVhere euer Dronus sups, or dines, or walks, He thinks on Dolon, and on Dolon talks; He's much indebted vnto him, he saies; And so thinke I, but debt is ta'ne two wayes. In debt to him sayth he? I know he's bound, Not for his loue, but t'is for many a pound. In Hergusum. Ep, 18. Drunken Hergusus is knowne euery where, Al spendthrifts know him, such as loue good beere Cuckolds, Pandars, and periur'd drabs can tell, Hee's strange to none, not scant to them in hell; Who knowes him not? if he be strange to one, Nosce teipsum T'is to himselfe, himselfe he ne're hath knowne. In Litorem. Ep.19. Litoris holds him for a simple swaine, That get's not forty pounds a yeare by's wits; But he (me thinks) makes small vse of his braine, His shifts are bad, nor dainty are his bits; Yet those, to whom the man is better knowne, Affirme he vseth all he hath, that's ?. In Hergusum. Ep. 20. Hergusus, I had almost quite forgot To aske thee why of late thou art so hot; I will not blame thy liuer, nor thy heart, Thy heate proceeds from some inferiour part. In Thrasonem. Ep. 21. Thraso protests his neighbours goods to couet, Is sinne so vile, no crime may be aboue it; To wish his wife, he sweares, mauger the Deuill Can be no sinne; for, shee's his greatest euill. In Biberium. Ep. 22. Because I sayd Biberius was discreete, In that he vs'd few words when we did meete, One fell a laughing, and this ieast did breake, Biberius drinks vntill he cannot speake. De Insignibus Oxoniensium. Ep. 23. I neuer did behold since I was borne, An Oxe or Bull whose head had not one horne: The Citizens of Oxforde had of yore A Bull that scant had halfe a horne, before The learned Tribe, which indecorum scorns, Out of their loue gaue them a paire of HORNS. In Britannicas Amazones. Ep. 24. They say a new Plantation is intended, Neare or about the Amazonian riuer, But sure that mannish race is now quite ended; O that great Ioue of all good gifts the giuer, Wold moue King Iames once more to store that clyme, With the Mall cut-purses of our bad time. De Corde &amp; Lingua. Ep. 25. Non loquitur os secundum cor. The tongue was once a seruant to the heart, And what it gaue she freely did impart; But now Hypocrisie is growne so strong, She makes the heart a seruant to the tongue. To his worthy friend Captaine Butler, Gouernour of Bermuda, or the Summer Ilands. Ep. 26. I marueil I, what mischiefes or what euils Hath made men call your Iles the Iles of Deuils, Is't for the perillous By reason of Rocks, the entrance into those Ilands is very dangeous. Rockes, or for the In the beginning of that plantation, great store of hoggs were found there. Swine, In whom our Lord the Legion did confine? What ere it be, let's heare no more complaints, So gouerne you, they may be Iles of Saints. In Thrasonem. Ep. 27. Thinke not amisse of Thraso in your hearts, Because he brags, and sets forth his good parts, For I haue knowne some backward to reueale That which they lost, because they did conceale. In Leuem. Ep. 28. Leuis was troubled with a iealous man, Which long perplex't the silly womans mind, But taking heart, she studies all she can For's iealous humor remedy to find: She so contriu'd, that through a little chinke He saw that done, which earst he did but thinke. In Mortem. Ep. 29. Death, wher's thy sting? I hope th'art taken downe, I feare thee not in Citie, Court, nor Towne; Thou need'st not boast thou rob'st men of their breath, For he that conquer'd Hell did conquer Death. In Quercium. Ep. 30. Qvercius queasie stomack feeds on muttons, Great eaters sin (saith he) and termes them glutons; To thrust himselfe out of the count of sinners, One legg of mutton serues him minc't ten dinners. De Luna. Ep. 31. VVomen from Luna's custome much doe stray, She makes hornes monthly, but they e'ry day. In Lenam. Ep. 32. Lena was once of gallants much esteem'd, But now she is as one vnworthy deem'd, By those of whom she hath bin often vs'd, She is contemned, scoft at, and abus'd; The reason's this; All men affect and wish To haue the youngest flesh and ouldest fish, In Tergusum. Ep. 33. Homer did drink, and Homer could not see, But Homer drunke not out his eyes, like ? In Littletonicum quendam. Ep. 34. The morrow next after an Ember Fast, Litoris brags of his last nights repast; Partrich and Pheasant, tut, with him's no dish; I thinke so to, wher's neither flesh nor fish: He alway keepes his bed, when he sups best, But Morpheus still is master of the feast. In Allum. Ep. 35. I ne're did wish thee well, thou saidst to day, Now therefore Allus marke what I shall say: I wish thy nose for euer may looke red, For, vvhen t'is pale (I feare) thou wilt be dead. In Ebriosum Ep. 36. Fle man, sayth she; but I tell mistris Ann, Her drunken husband is no drunken man; For, those whose wits are ouercome with drinke, Are voyd of reason, such are beasts I thinke. In Petræam. Ep. 37. Who sayth Petræa hath no abstinence? Those that say so, haue but a little sense, For most men know, ti's euident and plaine That none from Church doth more then she abstaine. In Thrasonem. Ep. 38. Thraso I thinke doth neare of anger dreame, Although his Coller seems to be extreame. In Lexum. Ep. 39.

VVhen Curuus first Siluanus daughter saw, Her heat of youth his frostie bloud did thaw; Which so inflamd the aged mans desire, That he ne're stood on portion with her Sire; Nor was there cause, the match was not so bad, For with his wife enough (God knowes) he had.

Ep. 44. It seems the English men are Caniballs, For they eat Fooles, and fooles we know are men; Such as eate men haue bitter barbarous galls, The English haue so, it should follow then. Resolutio.

Th'art vaine Magnasus for to be so proud, Because so many, where thou com'st, giue place, And most of those are of the vulgar croud, Yet were they Lords I think, t'were noe great grace: For one of better vnderstanding knowes, They giue not place to thee, but to thy Nose. In Thomansium Long. Ep. 46. Th'art very fitly nam'd Thomansius Long, For with thy name doth well accorde thy nature; Long ere thou wilt doe good, or right a wronge, Long in thy lyeing, likewise longe in stature, Th'art long in all, in Nature, stature, Name, But thou com'st short of vertue, and good fame. De Musis. Ep. 47. Ye reuerend Poets, now but earth and clay, And ye the gloryes of this present age, Vouchsafe mee leaue with due respect to say, Ye seemd to flatter in your sacred rage, Faining the Muses to be women, when Reason approues them rather to be men; Those Nine, in men are but a nine-fould skill, Which for the head is the supreamest part Doe there inhabit, as vpon a hill, Well nam'd Parnassus, or the house of Art; Ther's scant nine women wise; men nine times nine, Then reason will, they should be masculine. In Piscatorem quendam. Ep. 48. Ostendam piscem, quoth a learned Clarcke, That scornd to vse his mother tongue in schooles; A right wise scholler forthwith got a Barcke, And out he goes with all his angling tooles; His guide pointing to Heau'n, ere they went farre, Cry'd Ecce piscem, angle for the starre. De Oto. Ep. 49. Otus a Mayde both farre and neere hath sought, But cannot come, where he dares sweare is one; I tell him Maydes are common to be bought, If they be common then, sayth he, th'are none.

Thraso giu's out, he's riding out of towne, Yet still I meet him ietting in his gowne; Which would haue made me thought it but a brag, Had I not knowne he kept a running Nagg: But if to speake my conscience I were bidden, He rides not halfe so oft, as he is ridden. In Britannicam Amazonem. Ep. 51. God saue you Captaine. Oh I haue mistooke, Excuse mee Ladie; when I first did looke Vpon your broad-brymd hat, and flaunting feather, Those martiall ensignes met in you together, Made mee suppose a Captaine you had beene; Your sex like men I neare before haue seene. In Lizam. Ep. 52. Tarlton cut off all his skirts because none should sit vpon them. Crosse mee not Liza, ne'ther be so perte For if thou do'st, I'le sit vpon thy skerte.

PunctuallistsIn Quosdam Punctualisticos. Ep. 54. Ile tell a secret, if you will not mocke it, Some keepe a Kalender worne in their pockit, To note their dayes of buisnes and delights: Others doe beare about a Rowle of of knights, So punctuall are they; Yet to their disgrace, They haue mistaken both their Day, and Place.

Ep. 57. Drusa loues powdring, but she hateth salt; At first this humour seemeth very strange, Like his who loueth beere, yet hateth mault; But Drusa's woman-like, constant in chaunge. Which maks mee hope, that in her daintiest fare. She may loue salt, and hate her powdred haire. In Capistra fœminea. Ep. 58. Tradition sayth the Mair's of Oxforde wore, A Rope about their necks Ropes on or about the head was a signe of submission. 1. Kings 20.31 in time of yore But now for decencie of later yeares, In the Rop's place each Mai'r a Ribbin wears; This fashion women vse, which maks mee doubt, When that came in with them, their Ropes went out. Ad seipsum. Ep. 59. Nor pine, nor pranck, in pouerty or wealth; Nor curious be, nor carelesse of thy health; To others doe as they should doe to thee; Loue th'actiue life, yet not too busie bee. Maturely ponder, eare thou dost propounde, Prepare thy mind to want, and to abound: I giue my selfe this Counsell, to indeere Mee to my selfe, since to my selfe most neere. In Corbum. Ep. 60. Corbus will not, perswade him what I can, The world should take him for a Gentleman; His reason's this; because men should not deeme, That he is such, as he doth neuer seeme.

Men say th'art crooked and exceeding black, My eye obserues not any thing you lack, And I esteeme thee as a precious Iewell, In thee is that giu's my affection fewell; I loue thee much, what faults so ere men finde, Because I know thou hast a beuteous minde. In Lenonem. Ep. 62. Good lawes there be, and Proclamations made To force the abstinence from flesh in Lent; But Leno's appetite is so vnstaide, Flesh he must haue, though after he repent; I wonder how he keeps worms from his mawe, They say his flesh is leane, and fresh, and rawe. In quendam—Ep. 63. Honest Sir Iohn doth to his neighbours cry, Forsake the world, and learne the way to dye; If this be wholesome counsell he doth giue, Why then makes he himselfe such shift to liue? In Assinium. Ep. 64. Assinius weeps still, for he feares to dye, As who should say, teares did produce his dayes; Nay laugh not, till you know his reason why, Perhaps t'is such, that it will merrit prayse; Singing (sayth he) portends death to the Swan; Why may it not presage the like to man? Allusio ad præcedens. Ep. 65. This may be true; For wer't for ioy or sorrow, The Player Singer sung ouer night, and dy'd next morrow. In Mopsam. Ep. 66.

Tell me Assinius, how it comes to passe, That thou do'st hold in such contempt an Asse; Knew'st thou as much as I, I'de vndertake, Similis similem petit.Thou'dst loue an Asse better for thine owne sake. De Chinensibus. Ep. 70.

De quatuor Terminis militaribus. Ep. 77. If Souldiers may obtaine foure Termes of warre, Muskets shalbe the Pleaders, Pikes the Barre; And since our Termes are rare, get we but one, Mars shall eate flesh, Iustinian picke the bone. Or thus. Ep. 77.

The Doues will dwell in habitations cleane, Aspicis vt veniant ad candida tecta Columbæ.They thriue not, nor delight in any other: But thou hast got a habit so obsceane; (Which thou deriu'st neither from Sire nor mother) Thou dwell'st in Houses (and delight'st therein), Such as are nastie with the stench of sinne. In Floram. Ep. 83. Flora was sicke; they say she's now amended, But wanteth weight her sicknes so impaird her; That weight she wanteth shall be condiscended, She's now so light, that honest men discard her. If she be well, iudge those that haue more skill, In my opinion she is verry ill. Ad Dominam Sapientiam. Ep. 84. Ever young Lady, euer glorious faire, T'is strange the sons of men no more doe court thee, Youth, beautie, honour, wealth, vncertaine are A month they vexe, if one day they disport thee; How talpishe-blind are those, who doe not see, They nothing haue (Dame Wisdome) wanting thee? In quosdam non Ignotos. Ep. 85.

The time hath been, thou weart a sucking Calfe, And then thy mother daily vs'd to beare thee; But when thou wert a weanling, halfe in halfe, Thy weight encreas'd, and then thy Sire did reare thee; But now th'art growne an Oxe, I know not one Can beare thy Horns; thou art so monstrous growne. Ad Floram. Ep. 89. The vse of Masks I cannot but commend, To keepe the beautie from the scorching Sun; But Flora I would know, what you intend, Whether you feare the Moone, when day is done; For I haue heard, that duly euery night You weare a Maske, to smooth, but not to white. De suffocatione Matricis. Ep. 90. Bella is much afflicted with the Mother, No Physick can her mind's content restore; A contrary disease troubles her brother, Of some the Father Dolor patris tearmd; which lyes so sore Vpon his heart, and thence not to be driuen Till he may say, the Father is in heauen. In Leuem. Ep. 91. T'is white and red that most delights the eye, That cheek's ador'd, where those two colours lye; But thou look'st green as leeks, or greenest glasse, Which hue in thee, confirms all flesh is grasse.

Graue Senators, add to your Roy'l Exchange, One You may call it North streete. window more, through which your eyes with pleasure From thence may see your Feildes, and leuell range Of your young Plants; oh take not so much leasure For a good worke, which had beene done (some say) Longe since, had not a Quære de hoc. Stile stood in the way. De quodam iocoso. Ep. 93. A merry Greeke set vp a Siquis, late, To signifie a stranger come to towne, Who could great Noses, and their heate abate; His lodging, such an Inne, the day set downe, The hugest Noses thither made repaire, But Leech found none, they made mine host to stare. Of the Trees and Walkes in Moore-Fieldes. Ep. 94. Ye vpright Formalists, and grauelld walks, Thinke vpon Milletons water. Of you the Spaniard, Dutch, Italian talks; So talke they of your Citty's great Infectour, Old More-Ditch, and condemne the works directour That More-Ditch is not lesse Ditch, or more water, To cleanse the filth of those, The Cut-throates of White-crosse-street and others adjacent. that catle slaughter. In Vulpinum. Ep. 95. Vvlpinus twice was sicke, twice made his will, (With no intent, that then should be his last) Gaue all to those, who bore him no good will, Which well he knew, but policie forecast: That hope of gaine did gaine those men respect, Whom all the world would otherwise neglect. In Potatores. Ep. 96. Ye gusling drunkards, I do much admire, Your throats weare not, nor that your arms do tyre In swallowing drinke, and lifting double Iuggs, Which fright my senses, as the sight of buggs; O Guttur-Laine, how many sorts of drinke, Run poast through thee, as water downe a sincke? In temporis profusores. Ep. 97. The world is ful of prodigall expenders, The borrowers are more then are the lenders; Those Prodigalls commit the highest cryme, Who wast their liues in vaine expence of time. In quendam morbum equinum. Ep. 98. The'rs one disease in country and in London Hath men and horses ye, and women vndon; There cannot sure a more contagious thing come Then this disease that spreads o're all the Kingdome; I dare not nam't least Prides pyes in their passions Chatter against mee. Oh horses! oh the Fashions! In quosdam Tubicinatores. Ep. 99. Ye roaring beggers, tell mee what you meane, To spend each Christmas so much winde, to gleane Gratuities from men. O come not neere Where I abode or whisper in my eare; Be sure your tongues with modestie be tipt, And then I'le tell you, beggers must be whipt. In Zoilum. Ep. 100. My Booke is short sayth Zoilus, What then? I wish it short, and sweet to other men. FINIS. Libellus. If any aske me now, whose booke I am, I cannot answere without signes of shame; For he that owns mee very often saith, I am the worst of all the bookes he hath, And which more grieues me, calls me triuiall rymes, Th'vntimely issue of his idle times.
