The prayse of all women What tyme y? crabbe his course had past And Phebus atteyned the Aquarye The selfe same time wh? it frose fast Amyddes the moneth of Ianuarye I in my bedde, and slepe in myne eye A sodeyne assemble before me dyd appere And women they semed by abyte and chere. A wake they sayde, slepe nat so fast Consyder our grefe, and howe we be blamed And all by a boke, that lately is past Whiche by reporte, by the was fyrst framed The scole of women, none auctour named In prynte it is passed, lewdely compyled All women wherby be sore reuyled. Consyder therin, thyne owne good name Consyder also our infamye Sende forth some other, contrary the same For thyne and ours, bothe honestye The Pean thou wrote, and lyeth the bye Be quycke herein, prolonge nat thus As thou woldest our fauour, nowe do for vs Amongest all other, one boldely prest Obey sayd she shalt thou/be thou now so strong Her male &amp; her mantell, she threwe on my brest For I am she sayd she, thou hast do most wronge A wake a wake, thou slepest ouer longe Uenus am I cleped, my name shall nat be hyd Nowe sharpen thy pen, and wryte as a the byd. Of trueth it is, wryte on quod she The nature of man inclyneth to synne Rather than vertue, and reason is why Eche nature dothe ende, as it dothe begyn Salte wyl be water, thought none be therin The tre of the rote, dothe take his verdure The fruyte wherby, is knowen swete or soure. So at y? begynnyng, where man had that vse Of wyt and reason, to be ruled by By cause he offended, he made excuse The faute allegynge, to the femynye God to haue dysceyued, yf it wolde haue be And as he tho, to lye begon So to this daye, he holdeth on. Of vs pore women customably Without cause iust, to rayle and iest No nature naturate, vnder the skye Fysshe, fowle, worme, ne beest But with theyr owne kynde, the lyue at rest Man of all other, of maners so rude Can nat saye well by his symylytude. A great abuse, and shamefully holde Suche frowardnes, in hande to haue The selfe same thynge, whiche most they shulde Laude and loue, it to depraue And that of nede, whiche most they craue So to improper, great foly it is For in no wyse they may vs longe mys. Recorde the goodnes, of god almyghty At the creacyon, whiche he began Perceyuynge it coulde nat endure a ryght Without any helpe made to the man Faciamus (sayde he) and made Eue than The woman the man, to helpe and assyst It foloweth therfore, we can nat be myst Howe be it, ye men fast pore and prye All that ye may vs women agayne Nothynge lefte out, ye may come by Of holy wrytte, nor thot poetes do fayne All is alledged as thynge certayne And what that makes nat, for your purpose Shall be interpretate, with a lewde glose. Exemples many, faynt and feble Mo than ye may well iustyfye And saye it is a thynge impossyble Any one good woman founde to be Whiche euyll sayenge to ratyfye A sence of Salomon ye aledge, which sayth Mulierem fortem quis inueniet. But as to that thou shalt nat tary Lenger than nedes to make reporte As at this tyme them to contrary By any exemple, the nexte to retort Taken an nowe of the lyuynge sorte Contynue thy processe, tyll thou may espye A place therfore more necessary. Howe shulde this worlde contynued be Man I meane in his most nede Were nat women, what were ye Examples many, hereof may ye rede And ouer that ye se in dede Howe by the vertue of the femynyne face Myrrh encreaseth, and thoughtes gyue place. Pri. Re. xviii.Exempled in Saule, whan he shulde fyght Agaynst the armye phylystyne Had neyther herte, courage ne myght Ne wyst nat what to do therin With hongry thought hym selfe to pyne Had nat the woman hym counseyled and fed For feare in that fury, Saule had be deed Whan ye lye sycke and lyke to dye Who then attendeth you vnto. Were nat the woman, there myght ye lye Donge in your denne, as bestes do The woman is euer redy to go For this and that to watche and wake You to recouer many labours to take. If that your fynger other hede ake Or elles what ayleth you, hande or fote There can no medycyne the payne aslake Without the woman be your bote Lappe you warme in clothes softe A kercheyffe bonde vnto your hedde And in her armes bere you to bedde. Nyght and day than must she wake And redy be at the fyrst call A culles or some caudel make As for the sycke dothe best befall Oneles the woman come withall No man can get hym vp to sytte Therof to taste morsell or bytte Thus of y? woman great pleasures ye haue Whiche man to man can nat suffyce And yet ye do vs all depraue Sayenge we be neyther sadde ne wyse And that no profyte by vs doth ryse Where as in trueth recorde I can As many aryse as by the man. A woman playne dyd fyrst inuent Oui. mea th. li. v. All maner grayne to inne and sowe Ceres named by comune assent And for her wysdome, the people dyd knowe Honours diuyne they dyd her shewe And as her merytes dyd than expresse They named her the good goddesse. And in lyke maner a woman founde Isido. ll. i. ant. ix. The letters fyrst that we nowe wryte The A.B.C. as they do stande Wherby we vse our myndes to endyte One to another ful and perfyte Carmenta called as I remembre Mother vnto the famous Euander. Pallas the doughter of Iupyter August. de ciuita lib. vii. &amp; Oui. in fast. &amp;c.Through her entere and pured brayne The goddesse named of the artyfycer Of wolle and oyle, fyrst founde the vayne For whiche inuencyon the story is playne Preferred she was before Neptune To gyue the name to Athenes towne. Soppho the poetresse dyd also fynde With the harpe to synge the tune to wrest Whiche greatly conforteth mannes mynde With syghes of sorowe ouer prest i. Reg. xvi.Saule the kynge coulde neuer haue rest Tyll Dauyd had harpyd a fytte or two The malygne spryte, wolde nat hym fro. The Sybbilles .xii. dyd prophecy The sone of god shulde man become One of them shewed the mystery Unto Octauyan in the sonne Many is the yeres, that syth is ronne And yet the churche dothe occupye The selfe same Sybbilles prophecye. Hystoryes many I coulde forth lay That maketh wel with the feminye Of lyke sentence I dare well saye And grounded on good auctoryte Howe be it because that poetry Is taken nowe in suche despyte Of other reasons, I wyll thou wryte But fyrst this questyon, aske quod she Demurely, and after a gentyl rate, To whom be holden more are ye Unto the man that you begate Or to the woman puerperate I knowe no reason for your excuse But that it shulde your selues confuse. As sone as the woman, dothe conceyue Full dyuers is her appetyde Bothe bely and hert dothe ryse and heuy The stomake seldome satysfyde For many sondry meates prouyde Longe for more than she may gete. And many a sory morsell ete. In case she may it nat optayne Harde she escapeth with the lyfe And in her labour suche is the payne That as god knoweth the vrgent grefe Without a gracyous prerogatyfe Ware thynge, no doubte, impossyble She shulde escape, and after haue hele. And whan she is delyuered Syke and wepe contynually And as ye knowe but lytell consydered With many a man, the more blame he Who but the woman must keper he Prouyde for euery tagge and cloute And in her armes bere you aboute. In case the man suche labour shulde take I meane to bere you to and fro His armer and shulders wolde so ake That lame he wolde be of bothe two The sely woman hathe neuer do What in her armes and in her lappe Nyght and daye she must you wrappe Lytell or nothynge may she rest But alwayes besy you for to kepe Aryse and fede you with her brest And all to styll you whan ye wepe Where of your selfe, ye can scant crepe She must be redy to gyue you pappe From wynde &amp; wether, you warme to lappe. The man may lye and snowre full fast Whan that the wyfe must watche and wake Out of the bed her armes cast The cradell to rocke tyll they bothe ake The babe also vnto her take And whan he is vnclene beneth Must be content with many yll breth Shyfte hym ofte, wype and wesshe Cloutes and clothes newe prepare And be it harde or be it nesshe She woman must do a way the ware Thus hathe the mother all the care All the labour and dyssease Where as the father dothe what hym please. When that ye drawe nere, xii. monethes olde Than may the woman nother rest ne sytte But euer dadle you in sure holde Tyll tyme that ye haue founde your fyt Her brestes ye tere with many a byt And scratche also with your sharpe nayles And yet the woman you neuer fayles. Where as the man wolde sure dysdayne And be therwith impacyent And peraduenture stryke agayne Nother be eftsons so dylygent If ons ye dyd hym dyscontent For as ye se when hym myslyketh The man dayly his chylderne stryketh The mother tendreth them alway And scant can suffer them in the wynde Of them in doute bothe nyght and daye Lest any male chaunce shulde them blynde Ought you nat then to the woman to be kynde Howe be it ye haue no better sporte Than of the woman euyll to reporte Some saye the woman had no tonge After that god had her create Untyll the man toke leues longe And put them vnder her palate An aspyn leffe of the dyuel he gatte And for it moueth with euery wynde They saye womens tongues be of lyke kynde. I saye the fable rehersed before The trueth well knowen is but a lye All the clerkes that euer were Do wryte the same and testefye That god made all thynge parfetlye Howe shulde the woman then tonge haue none And be of goddes creacyon, Because that Eue our prime parent The wyll of god dyd ons transgresse They blame all women in lyke consent And make them selfe alwayes fauteles There be of women as of men doutles All be it that dyuers haue offended Yet ought nat all to be reprehended All maner clothe is nat lyke fyne Nor yet all men complexyoned lyke Some more of colour, some more sanguyne Some malancolye, some fleamatyke Some longe and small, some shorte and thycke Nat euery man of one compleccyon Nor euery woman of one condycyon Why shulde the woman then be blamed More than the man, and he lyke bad Me thynkes ye ought to be ashamed And also in conscyence sore adrade In case that ye any conscyence had Ro. ii.Wytnes saynt Paule, it doth no man beseme Worse of a nother than of hym selfe to deme Admytte that woman fyrste offended The man persuadynge to transgres A woman was she, the faute that amended Genises. By meane of her great humblenes. Of mannes restore the chefe foundres Eue was she that made vs thrall And Mary was she that loused all. And ouer that in genesye I fynde it wryten, that god dyd make The woman for man an helpe to be Nat of vyle erthe out of the lake But of a rybbe that he dyd take Out of the mannes ryght syde And the woman made of thynge well tryde Lyke as ye se by experyence Golde forged of leade, yren and tynne And is hym selfe in his fyrst essens No better than the matter he was fyrst in And nowe more valued than man myne Lyke so dyd god the femynyne Plaimate of the masculyne. Ye se also the ryche Rubies And other stones of hye vertue Set in golde at poynt deuyse And in thynge of small value In symblable wyse hymselfe Iesu Wolde of the woman incarnate be Mayden and wyfe his mother Mary. And sythe that god the woman create Of thynge thus pured, and nat the man To the ende she shulde helpe hym algate Of congruence it foloweth than Than in no wyse mysse ye can The man (as who sayeth) is the adiectyue And the woman is playne the substantyue. For as wytnesseth the accidence The adiectyue may nothyng do Oneles it be vnder pretence Of other substance put therto The man lnlyke effecte also without the wonans helpynge hande By hym selfe may nat longe stande If a man without womans consent Myght haue redrest the fyrste offence It had nat neded the omnipotent To haue come hym selfe to make y? admendes The woman was chosen by diuyne assence To be through her humylyte The well of our tranquilyty. And who that lysteth the trueth to trye Shall fynde in the Bible thorowe &amp; thorowe That god dyd fauoure the femynyne Many tymes as well as you And in the woman dyd of renewe Agaynst all naturall dysposycyon In steryll age parentall fruycyon. As fyrst in the boke of Genesys Ge. iii. i. Reg. i. Iudici. xiii. iiii. Reg. iiii. Of Ioseph, Isaac, and Samuell With other mo in places sondry As of Sampson ye may fynde well Lyke of the Sunamyte befell The Bible rede and ye shall fynde That these were borne past course of kynde. And in lyke case Elyzabeth Luce. i. The mother of holy Iohan Baptyst Saynt Anne also as scrypture sayeth Conceyued Mary mother of Chryst Math. i. Mary also that man neuer wyst Conceyued by grace both god and man Mayden &amp; mother bothe nowe and than Thus haue ye sure certifycate That god muche fauoureth the femyn kynde Sythe he hym selfe after suche rate Tendreth in them the deuout mynde And furthermore no doute I fynde That god permytted man to make Wonders many for the womans sake. As fyrst we fynde by diuine sopraycyon iiii. Reg iiii. Done by the prophet Helysye A lytell oyle and all by myracle Made to encrease and multyply Ibedem.
