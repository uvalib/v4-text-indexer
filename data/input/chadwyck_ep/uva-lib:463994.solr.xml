Here Bygynnys the Sege off Melayne. 1 All werthy men that luffes to here Off cheuallry þat by fore vs were Þat doughty weren of dede, Off charlles of Fraunce, þ? heghe kinge of alle, Þat ofte sythes made hethyn men for to falle, Þat styffely satte one stede. This geste es sothe, wittnes þ? buke, Þ? ryghte lele trouthe who so will luke, In Cronekill for to rede. Alle lumbardy þay made þaire mone And saide þaire gaumes weren alle gone Owttrayede with hethen thede. 2 The sowdane Arabas the stronge Werreyde appon Crystyndome with wronge And Ceties brake he downn; Robbyde þ? Romaynes of theire rent, Þ? popys pousty hase he schente, And many a kynges with Crownn. In Tuskayne townnes gon he wyn And stuffede þam wele with hethyn kyn, This lorde of grete renownn; And sythen to lumbardy he wane, Mighte to lett hym hade no man, Thus wynnes he many a townn. 3 The Emagery þat the[r] solde bee, Bothe the Rode &amp; þe marie free, Brynnede þam in a fire: And þan his Mawmettes he sett vp there In kirkes and abbayes þat there were, Helde þam for Lordes and Syre. To Melayne sythen he tuke þ? waye And wanne þ? Cyte apon a daye, Gaffe his men golde &amp; ill hyre. Many a Martyre made he there Off men and childire pat there were And ladyes swete of Swyre. 4 Þ? lorde of Melayne, sir Alantyne, Sawe þ? Crystynde putt to pyne, Oute of þ? townn he flede To a Cyte þat was there by, Alle nyghte he thoghte þer In to ly, He was full straytly stede. Þay myghte it wynn with spere &amp; schelde Appon þ? morne hym buse it ?elde Or laye his lyfe in wede. Was neuer no knyghte putt to mare care, Full hertly to Criste þan prayes he thare To knawe þ? lyfe he ledde. 5 Þ? Sawdane sent hym messangers free And bade hym torne and hethyn bee And he solde haue his awenn: Melayne, that was the Riche Cite, And alle þ? laundis of lumbardye, And to his lawe be knawenn: “And if he ne will noghte to oure lawe be sworne He sall be hangede or oþer morne And with wylde horse be drawen: His wyffe &amp; his childire three By-fore his eghne þat he myghte see Be in sondre sawenn.” 6 He prayede þ? sowdane þan of grace Þat he wolde byde a littill space Whils one þ? morne at daye, And he sall do hym for to witt If þat he wolde assent to itt To leue apon his laye. Bot þan heues he vp his handis to heuen, To Iesu Criste with mylde steuen Full hertly gane he praye. “Lorde,” he saide, “als þou swelte appon þ? tree, Of thy man þou hafe Pete, And Mary mylde þat maye! 7 If I solde Crystyndome for-sake And to hethyn lawe me take Þ? perill mon be myn. Bot, lorde, als þou lete me be borne Late neuer my sawle be forlorne Ne dampnede to helle pyne. Bot, lorde, als þou swelte on þ rode And for mankynde schede thi blode Some concelle sende þou me: Whethire þat me es better to doo, The hethyn lawe to torne too, Or my lyfe in lande to tyne.” 8 Than wente þat knyghte vn to bedde For sorowe hym thoghte his hert bledde, And appon Iesu þan gan he calle. And sone aftire þat gane he falle one slepe Als man þat was wery for-wepe. Þan herde by hym on a walle Ane Angelle þat vn-to hym gane saye: “Rysse vp, sir kynge, &amp; wende thy waye, For faire þe sall by falle, To Charles þat beris the flour delyce, Of oþer kynges he berys þe pryce, &amp; he sall wreke thy wrethis alle.” 9 The Angelle bade hym ryse agayne, “And hy þ? faste to charlemayne, Þ? Crownnede kynge of Fraunce, And say hym god byddis þat he sall go To helpe to venge the of thy foo Bothe with spere &amp; launce.” The kynge was full fayne of that, His swerde in his hande he gatt And þerto graythely he grauntis. He garte swythe sadyll hym a palfraye And Euen to Fraunce he tuke þ? waye, Now herkenys of þis chaunce. 10 The same nyghte by fore þ? daye Als kyng Charls in his bedde laye A Sweun þan gan he mete. Hym thoghte ane angele lyghte als leuen Spake to hym with mylde steuen, Þat gudly hym gane grete. Þat angele by-taughte hym a brande, Gaffe hym þ? hiltis in his hande, Þat euen was handefull mete: And saide:“Criste sende the this swerde, Mase the his werryoure here in erthe, He dose þe wele to weite. 11 He biddes þou sall resteyne it tyte And þat þou venge alle his dispyte, For thynge þat euer may bee. And sla alle there thou sees me stryke, And sythen þou birne vp house &amp; dyke, For beste he traystis in thee.” The walles abowte Melayne townne Hym thoghte þ? angele dange þam downn, þat closede In þat Cite. Sythen alle þ? landis of lumbardy, Townnes, borows, and bayli: this was selcouthe to see. 12 When Charls wakenede of his dreme He sawe a bryghtenes of a beme Vp vn-to heuenwarde glyde. Bot when he rose þ? swerde he fande Þat þe Angelle gaffe hym in his hande Appon his bedde syde. He schewede it thanne to his Baronns alle, And than saide his lordes bothe grete &amp; smalle: “Þ? sothe is noghte to hyde: We wote wele þat goddis will it es Þat þou sall conquere of hethennesse Countres lange and wyde.” 13 To mete þan wente þat Riche kynge Bot sone come there newe tydynge, Als he in sete was sette. The lorde of Melayne he sawe come In, Þat was his Cosyn nere of kyn, And hym full gudely grette. The grete lordis alle hailsede hee And prayede þam all sesse of theire glee, And sayse to Charls with owtten lette: “Iesu Criste hase comaunde thee To fare to þ? felde to feghte for mee, My landis agayne to gette.” 14 He tolde þam alle at þ? Borde and by That the Sara?enes had wonn lumbardy— Þay mornede &amp; made grete mone— And how the angelle bade hym goo: The kynge tolde his sweuen alsoo, Þay accordede bothe in one. Thane sayde þ? Beshope Turpyne: “Hafe done! late semble þ? folke of thyne! Myn hede I vndir nome Þat gode es greuede at þ? sara?enes boste: We salle stroye vp alle theire hoste, Þose worthely men in wone.” 15 Bot alle þat herde hym Genyenn, Þat was a lorde of grete renownn And Rowlande Modir hade wedde. Þare wery hym bothe god &amp; sayne Iohn, The falseste traytoure was he one, Þat euer with fode was fedde! For landis þat Rowlande solde haue thare Dede fayne he wolde þat he ware, Þ? Resone ryghte who redde. His firste tresone now by gynnes here, Þat þe lordis boghte sythen full dere, And to ladyse grete Barett bredde. 16 “Sir,” he sayde, “þat ware a Synfull chaunce, Whatt solde worthe of vs in Fraunce, And þou in þ felde were slayne? Thy selfe and we at home will byde And latte Rowlande thedire Ryde, Þat euer to Bekyre es bayne, With Batelle &amp; with brode banere; Of his wyrchippe wolde I here, Witt ?e wele, full fayne.” For Rowlande this resone he wroghte Euere more in his herte he thoghte He solde neuer come agayne. 17 The kynge þan sent a Messangere To grette lordes bothe ferre &amp; nere And bade þam make þam ?are. Bot þ? peris take a concelle newe Þat made alle fraunce ful sore to rewe And byrdis of blyse full bare. Þay prayede þ? kynge on þat tyde Þat he hym selfe at home walde byde, To kepe þat lande ri?t thare: “And Sendis Rowlande to lumbardy, With fourty thowsande cheualry Of worthy men of were.” 18 Then Rowlande thus his were þan made Fares forthe with Baners brade, Þ? kynge byleues þare still With-In þ? Cite of Paressche For to kepe þat townn of pryce, Als þay accordede till. And if þ? Sowdane wane þ? felde Lyghtly walde þey it noghte ?elde To þay had foughtten þaire fill. Bot be comen was þ? feftenede daye Þer fore myghte mornne bothe man &amp; maye, And ladyse lyke full ill. 19 To Melayne euen þay made þam bownn, And Batelde þam þare by-fore þ? townn, þose knyghttis þat were kene. And In to þ? Sowdane þay sent a knyghte And bade hym come owte with þam to fyghte, To witt with owtten wene. The Sowdane grauntis wele þer-till, Þat tornede oure gudmen all to gryll, And many one mo to mene. Than þ? Sara?ene come owte of þat Cite, Forty thowsandes of cheualrye, Þ? beste in erthe myghte be[ne]. 20 Þ? forthirmaste come a sara?ene wyghte, Sir Arabaunt of Perse he highte, Of Gyon was he kynge: He saide þer was na cristyn knyghte, Ware he neuer so stronge ne wyghte, To dede he [ne] solde hym dynge. And one sir Artaymnere of Beme, Þat was sir Olyueres Eme, Byfore þ? stowre þay thrynge; And euen at þ? firste countire righte Þe Sara?en slewe oure cristyn knyghte, It was dyscomforthynge. 21 The lorde of Melayne to hym Rade, Sir Alantyne with owtten bade, Þ? Crystyn knyghte to wreke, Bot he stroke oure Cristyn knyghte þat stownde Þat dede he daschede to þ grounde, Mighte no worde after speke. Sythen afterwarde he bare down Worthy lordes of grete renownn, Ay to his launce gane breke: And sythen areste þaire nobill stedis And to þ? hethyn hoste þam ledis: Loo þus-gates fares þ? freke! 22 Bot by þat was done þ? grete gon mete Barouns ondir blonkes fete Braythely ware borne donn. Thay stekede many a staleworthe knyghte, Þ? hethen folke in þat fyghte Þ? moste were of renownn. Oure knyghtis one þ? gronde lyse With wondes wyde one wafull wyse Crakkede was many a Crownn: Riche hawberkes were all to-rent, And beryns thorowe þaire scheldis schent, Þat many to bery was bownn. 23 Þ? Sara?ene semblede so Sarely Þat þay felde faste of oure cheualrye, Oure vawarde down þay dynge. Righte at þ? firste frusche þay felde Fyve thowsande knyghtis trewly telde, this is no lesynge! Oure knyghtis lyghtede one þ? bent, Thorowe þaire scheldis are þey schent, Of sorowe þan myghte þay synge! Than oure Medill-warde gane þam mete, Þare myghte no beryns oure bales bete, Bot þ? helpe of heuens kynge. 24 Þ? Medill warde sir Rowlande ledde, Þat doghty in felde was neuer drede To do what solde a knyghte. Fyfty Lordis of gret Empryce, Of Fraunce, þat bare þ floure delyce, Hase loste bothe Mayne &amp; myghte. Our Medillwarde sone hade þaye slayne, And Rowlande was in handis tane, And oþer seuen þat were knyghtes. But als god gaffe hym þat chaunce, Þay wende he hade bene kynge of fraunce Þat lyfede in þase fyghtis. 25 Bot of a knyghte me rewes sore, Þat in þ? felde laye wondede thore, Þ? Duke of Normandy. He lukes vp in the felde, His vmbrere with his hande vp helde, On Rowlande gane he cry: “Rowlande, if þ? tyde þat chaunce Þat þou come euer more in to fraunce, For þe lufe of mylde Marie, Comande me till oure gentill kynge, And to þ? Qwene my lady ?ynge, And to all Cheualrye. 26 And if þou come in to Normandy, Grete wele my [faire] lady, And sir Richerd my sone; And dubbe hym Duke in my stede, And bydde hym venge his Fadir dede, Of myrthe if he will mone. Bid hym hawkes &amp; houndes forgoo, And to dedis of armes hym doo, thase craftes for to konne; Appon þ? cursede Sara?ens for to werre, Venge me with dynt of spere, For my lyfe es nere done. 27 A, Rowlande! by-haulde nowe wnatt I see, More Ioye ne myghte neuer bee, In ?outhe ne ?itt in elde. Loo! I see oure vawarde ledde to heuene With Angells songe &amp; merye steuene, Reghte as þay faughte in þ? felde! I see moo Angells, loo! with myn eghe, Then there are men with-In Cristyante, Þat any wapyn may welde. To heuen þay lede oure nobill knyghtis, And comforthes þam with mayne &amp; myghtis, With mekill blysse &amp; belde.” 28 Bot by Rowland gan a sara?ene stande Þat braydede owte with a bryghte brande When he harde hym say soo; And to þ? Duke a dynt he dryvede, At þ? erthe he smate righte of his hede; Þer-fore was Rowlande woo; And Rowland styrte þan to a brande And hastily hent it owte of a sara?ene hande, And sone he gane hym sloo. With þat swerde he slewe sexty, Þ? beste of þ? sara?ene cheualrye, Off hardy men and moo. 29 Þan Rowlande in handis is taken agayne, And putt vn to full harde payne, Þat Sorowe it was to see. And foure nobill knyghtis þan haue þay slayne, By-fore þat were in handis tane With sir Rowlande þ? free. The Sowdane comandis of his men, An hundrethe knyghtis to kepe þam then, Rowland and oþer three, And to oure rerewarde sythen þay rode; Oure Barons boldely þam abode, Nowe helpe þam þ? Trynytee! 30 Þ? Duke of Burgoyne, sir Bellande, Þ? Fadir of sir Gy of nevynlande, Þ? rerewarde þan Rewlis hee. He comforthede alle oure nobyll knyghtis, Said, “lordis, halde ?our feldes &amp; ?our ryghttis And no sara?ene ?ee flee. And þofe ?e see thies lordis be slayne Ne hope ?e noghte for alle þaire payne Þat ne we sall solance see, Bot the werkynge of oure wondis sare Of the paynes of helle fele we no mare, Bot hy to heuen one heghe.” 31 Thay fruschede In fersely: for goddis sake Grete strokes gane þay gyffe and take With wondis werkande wyde: Bot ?itt the sara?ens with þay speris Full ferre on bakke oure Batelle berys And knyghtis felde vndir fete. Walde neuer no Crystyn knyghte thethyn flee Þoghe þat he wyste ryghte there to dye, I doo ?owe wole to wytt. Bot alle in fere þay Endide righte thare Þat Sewede þ? Sara?enes sythen full sare For lordis þat leuede þ? swete. 32 Thus fourty thowsande hafe þay slayne Safe foure þat were in handis tane, Rowlande ande oþer three: One was þ? gentill Erle sir Olyuere, Anoþer was sir Gawtere, Þe kyngis Cosyns nere; The thirde was sir Gy of Burgoyne, His Fadir in þ? felde laye þere slone, Þe soryare myghte he bee. They ledde thies lordes in to Melayne, With þat þ? Sowdane turnes agayne Righte gladde of his men?ee. Prymus passus: the first Fytt. 33 To the Sowdane chambir many a man Oure foure lordis ledd thay than To rekken of theire Arraye. Thay Ette and dranke and make þam glade, Bot littill myrthe oure lordis hadde: Þ? Sowdane gane þam saye, “Welcome be thow, kynge of Fraunce, The by-tide a cely chaunce, thi lyfe was sauede this daye. The false lawes of Fraunce sall downn, The Rewme sall leue one Seynt Mahownn Þat alle þ? myghtyeste maye!” 34 And Rowlande answerde full gentilly: “I ne rekke whethir I lyfe or dye, By god þat awe this daye. Kynge of Fraunce ame I none, Bot a Cosyne ame I one To charlles by my faye. He will gyffe me golde and Fee, Castelles ryche with towris heghe, Þat lorde full wele he maye. Bot goddis forbode &amp; þ? holy Trynytee Þat euer fraunce hethen were for mee And lese oure crysten lawe! 35 For sothe, þou Sowdane, trowe þou moste One þe Fader and þ? Sone and þ? holy goste, thire thre are alle in one: Þat Borne was of Marye free, Sythen for vs dyede one a tree, In other trowe we none.” Thane loughe þ? sowdane withe eghne full smale, And saide; “ane hundrethe of ?oure goddis alle hale Haue I garte byrne in a Firre with bale Sen Firste I wanne this wone. I sawe at none no more powstee Than att anoþer rotyn tree One erthe, so mote I gone! 36 Goo, feche one of theire goddis In And if he in this fire will byrne Alle oþer sett att noghte.” Þan furthe þer rane a sara?ene in þat tyde To a kyrke was there by-side, A faire rode In he broghte Fourmede ewenn als he gane blede. Oure Cristen knyghtis by-gane þaire crede And Rowland god by-soughte, And saide: “þou þat was borne of a May, Schewe þou, lorde, thi meracle this day, Þat with thi blode vs boghte!” 37 They keste þ? Rode in to þ? fire And layde Brandis with mekill Ire, Fayne wolde þay garre hym birne. The Sowdane saide: “now sall ?e see What myghte es in a rotyn tree Þat ?oure byleue es In. I darre laye my lyfe full ryghte Þat of hym selfe he hase no myghte Owte of this fire to wyn. How solde he þan helpe a-noþer man That for hym selfe no gyn ne kan, Noþer crafte ne gyn?” 38 Thay caste one it full many a folde, Þ rode laye still ay as it were colde, No fire wolde in hym too. All if þ? crosse were makede of tree The fire ?ode owtt þat come þer nee, Þan wexe þe sowdan woo: “And ?if þ? deuell,” he sayde, “be hym with In He sall be brynt or euer I blyne;” Of hert he was full throo. “Thies cursede wreches þat are here In Hase wethede þaire goddis þat þai may not byrn, I wote wele it es soo.” 39 Þan bromstone þat wele walde birn, And pykke &amp; terre mengede þer In, Þay slange in þ? fire full bolde. Torches þat were gude and grete For to helpe þat mekill hete Þay caste In many a folde. The fire wexe owte at þ? laste, Oure knyghtis made þaire prayere faste To Criste þat Iudas solde. The rode braste &amp; gaffe a crake, Þat þam thoghte þat alle þ? byggynge brake, Þat was with In þat holde. 40 A fire þan fro þ? crosse gane frusche, And In þ? Sara?ene eghne it gaffe a dosche, Ane Element als it were, That þay stode still als any stone, Haundis nore fete myghte þay stirre none Bot drery wexe in chere, Thay wyste noþer of gude ne ill. Þan Rowlande sais his felawes vn-till: “Sirs, hy vs alle hethyn in fere. This Meracle es schewede thorowe goddis grace For alle þe sara?enes in this place May noþer see nore here.” 41 Sayde sir Gy of Burgoyne: “?itt or I goo The sowdane sall haue a stroke or twoo Þat glade sall hym no glee.” He ferkes owte with a fawchon And hittis þ? Sawdane one þ? crownn Vn to þ? girdyll welle nee. Thay tuke þ? grete lordes with Ire And brynte þam in þat bale fire, Those doughty garte they dye. Bot sythen þ? Sara?enes Crouned sir Garsy, Þay ofte sythes chaste oure cheualry, A bolde Sara?ene was he. 42 Alle þat was þan in þat place Thay slewe clenly thorow goddis grace, Oure worthy men &amp; wyghte. And Sythen owte at þ? ?ates they ?ede Ilkone of þam fande a whitte stede Sadilt &amp; redy dighte. Thay stirtt vp on those stedis full steryn, Þay fande no man þat þam wolde warne, Oure ferse men felle in fighte. And als þ? Cronekill ?itt will saye Eeuen to Fraunce þay tuke þ? waye, To Paresche þay ryde full righte. 43 Bot ?itt þay wolde noghte come att Paresche To þay had offerde to Seyne Denys, And wendis to þat abbaye; And leues þaire stedis righte at þ? ?ate And wightly In þay tuke þ? gate, Þaire prayers for to say. And by þay hade þayre prayers made Agayne þay come with owtten bade, Thaire horse þan were away. And alle þe bellis þat in þat abbaye was Range allone thorowe goddis grace, Whils it was pryme of þ? day. 44 And there-by wiste those lordis of pryce That þ myghte of god and Seynt denys Had broghte þam thethyn a way: Thaire horse þat so there come to handes Was thorowe þ? prayere of seynt Denys, Thus will þ? Cronecle say. Bischope Turpyne þan come fro paresche townn To seynt Denys with grete Processiownn For thiese lordes for to pray That was in lumbardy at þe were: And when he sawe Rowlande there He saide: “lordis, morne we may.” 45 Thay meruelde why þ? bellis so range, And þ? clergy lefte theire sange, Thoghte ferly of þat fare; Thay hade meruelle whate it myghte mene. Als sone als þ? byschoppe hade Rowlande sene To hym he went full ?are. Sayd: “a, Rowlande, how fares lumbardye And all oure nobill cheuallry, þat þou hade with the thare?” “Certis, sir Bischoppe, it is noghte to layne, The sara?enes hase oure gude men slayne, Þou seese of þam na mare.” 46 The Bischop keste his staffe hym fro Þe mytre of his hede also: “I sall neuer were the more, Ne oþer habite for to bere, Bot buske me bremly to þ? were, And lerene one slyke a lore. A! Mary mylde, whare was thi myght, Þat þou lete thi men thus to dede be dighte, Þat wighte &amp; worthy were? Art þou noghte halden of myghtis moste, Full Conceyuede of þ? holy goste? Me ferlys of thy fare. 47 Had þou noghte, Marye, ?itt bene borne Ne had noghte oure gud men thus bene lorne? Þ? wyte is all in the. Thay faughte holly in thy ryghte, Þat þus with dole to dede es dyghte, A! Marie, how may this bee?” The Bischoppe was so woo þat stownnd, He wolde noghte byde appon þ? grownnd A Sakerynge for to see, Bot forthe he wente, his handis he wrange, And flote with Marye euer amange For þ? losse of oure men?ee. 48 Then Come kynge Charls appon Pilgremage Fro Paresche town with his Baronage To seynt Denys he went. Bot when the Bischoppe mett with þ? kynge He wolde noghte say “gud mornynge,” Ne ones his browes blenke. Þ? kynge hade meruelle what þat myght be, Bot als sone als he Rowlande see Wyghtly to hym he went. Be Rowlande had his tale tolde Þ? kynge myghte noghte a tere holde, For bale hym thoght he brynt. 49 “Allas,” he saide, “Cosyn syne, Whare are alle þ? nobill knyghtis of myne Þat euer to fighte were fayne?” “Sir, bi god &amp; by sayne Iohn, Þe Sara?enes alle bot vs hase slone, It is no bote to layne. Bot we were taken in to holde, Bot als þat criste hym selfe wolde Þat we wan owte agayne, Thorowe þ? grace of god om[n]ipotent, In his chambir or we went Þ? Sowdane haue we slayne.” 50 Genyonn saide: “lorde, by my Rede, All if þ? Sowdane thus be dede Thay will haue anoþer newe, A more schrewe þan was the toþer, Garcy þat is his awenn brothir, Þat more Barett will brewe. These landes of hym I rede ?e halde Or he will kindill cares full calde, ?he trowe þis tale for trewe. Or ells with In thies monethes three Als qwhitte of Fraunce sall ?he bee Als ?he it neuer ne knewe.” 51 “Now cristis Malyson,” quod þ? Bischoppe,” myghte he haue Þat Charle firste this concell gaffe &amp; noghte bot it be righte! To make homage to Sara?ene, Iesu kepe vs fro þat pyne And Marie his modir bryghte! Bot at home, sir kynge, þou sall kepe nane Bot alle thy gud men with the tane, Þat worthy are &amp; wighte, Appon ?one cursede sara?enes to were, And venge the one þam with dynt of spere, Þat þus thi peris hase dyghte. 52 And alle þe Clergy vndir-take I Off alle Fraunce full sekerly Þay sall wende to þat were. Of þ? pope I haue pouste, Att my byddynge sall þay bee Bothe with schelde and spere.” The Bischoppe sendis ferre &amp; nere To monke, Chanoun, Preste and frere, And badd þam graythe þaire gere, And keste þaire [care] clene þam froo, Come helpe to feghte one goddis foo, Alle þat a swerde may bere. 53 The Clergy grauntes alle þer to, Als doghety men of dede solde do, Þat worthy were &amp; wyghte. Be comen was wekes three Thare semblede a ful faire men?he, In baneres burneschid bryghte. A hundrethe thowsande were redy bownn Of Prestis þat werede schauen crownn, And fresche men for to fighte. Thay lightede appon a lawnde so clere Vndir þe Mownte Mowmartere, It was a ful faire syghte. 54 With þat þe Bischoppe Turpyn come, And also a Cardynall of Rome, With a full grete powere, Thay semblede appon a noþer syde Baners bett with mekill pryde, Þ? clergy þat was so clere. And appon þaire knees þay knelide down, The Bischoppe gafe þam his Benyson, Alle hollyly in fere. And thane sent he In to the kynge And badde hym forth his Baronns brynge, And saide, “my Prestis are here.” 55 Bot ?itt this false Genyoun Conselde þe kynge ay with treson Þat hym selfe solde duelle þer still: “And lette þe Bischoppe wende his waye, Doo at ?one Sara?enes that he maye, There sall he feghte his fill: And byde thi selfe in this Citee. Slayne in þ? felde gife þat þou bee Alle Fraunce may like it full ill.” And with his concelle and his fare Slyke concell he gaffe þam þare The kynge grauntis þer till. 56 And forthe to þ? Bischoppe þan sendis he, And for thynge þat euer myghte bee He solde hym neuer be-swyke. Bot take his nobill Cheualrye And wende forthe in to lumbardy, “For I will kepe my Ryke.” The Bischoppe saide: “by goddes tree, Or þat Charls doo so with mee Full ill it sall hym lyke! I sall hym curse in myddis his face. What! sall he nowe with sory grace Be-come ane Eretyke?” 57 The Bischoppe leues his powere thare And In to þ? Cite gane he fare And þ? Cardenall with hym. And when he come by fore þ? kynge There was none oþer haylsynge Bot stowte wordes and grym. He saide: “allas, sir Charllyone, That þou thus sone be comes a crayon, Me thynke thi body full dym. Alle the false councell þat touches þ? crown Here gyffe I þam goddis malyson, Bothe in lyfe and lyme. 58 And Cristis Malyson myghte he haue That fyrste to þ? þat Concell gaffe, And here I curse the, þou kynge! Be cause þou lyffes in Eresye, Thou ne dare noghte fyghte one goddes Enemy:” &amp; a buke forthe gane he brynge: And þ? Sertayne sothe als I ?ow telle He dyde all þat to cursynge felle, this was no manere of lesynge. “Nowe arte þou werre þan any Sara?ene, Goddes awenn wedirwyne, Of sorowe now may þou synge! 59 If Cristyndome loste bee Þ? wyte bese casten one the, Allas, þat þou was borne! Criste for the sufferde mare dere, Sore wondede with a spere, And werede a Crown of thorne. And now þou dare noghte in the felde For hym luke vndir thy schelde, I tell þ? saule for lorne. Men will deme aftir thi daye how falsely þou forsuke thi laye, And calle the kynge of skorne.” 60 Bot then kyng Charls with owtten wene At the byschoppe was so tene A fawchone hase he drawen, And þ? Bischoppe styrte þan to a brande, Hent it owt of a sqwyers hande, Both with myghte &amp; mayne, And braydes owte þ? blade bare: Be myghtfull god þan he sware: “If I wiste to be slayne, Charls, and þou touche mee Thou fares noghte forthir fete thre Or it be qwitt agayne.” 61 Than grete lordes ?ede þam by-twene, The kynge comande his knyghtis kene The Bischoppe for to taa. And þ? Bischoppe said: “sirres, I will ?ow no scathe And bi my faythe it es grete wathe Bot if ?e late me gaa. For certis I will noghte taken bee With nane þat I now here see, Bot if ?ee firste me slaa. And whilk of ?ow þat touches me With owtten harme passes noghte hee.” Than with his horse come þay. 62 “Here,” he said, “I a-vowe to mylde marie, And to hir sone god almyghttye, I sall noghte leue the soo. For we are halden with þ? righte Clerkes appon cursede men to fighte, I calle the goddes foo. I sall gerre buske my batelle bownn And halde the, Charls, with In þis townn, With-owt þou sall noghte goo. Was neuer kynge þat werede a crown So foule rebuytede with Relygyon, Þou sall sone witt of woo. 63 Goddes byddynge hast þou broken, Thurghe þ? traytour speche spoken Alle Cristendom walde þou schende. When Criste sent the a suerde vn till Thou myghte wele wiete it was his will that thi selfe solde thedir wende, There-fore I sall stroye the, Bryne and breke downn thi Cite, If þou be neuer so ten[d]e. Then to ?one sara?enes wende sall I, Fighte with þam whils I may dry, In goddes seruyce to ende.” 64 The Bischoppe &amp; þ? Cardynere Appon þaire horses gatt bothe in fere, Owte of þ? townn þay rade Also faste als þay myghte dryve To the grete Batelle be-lyfe, And Buskede baners full brade. They Romede to-warde Paresche town, And thoghte to bete the Cyte downe With þe powere þat he hade. “Slyke clerkes beris my Benysone, For trewere men of Relygyoun In erthe were neuer none made.” 65 Charls ouer þe walles bi-helde, And sawe the hoste come in the felde And drawe to-wardes þ? town. Bot þan said Duke Naymes vn to þ? kynge: “Sir, ?onder comes vs new tythynges With Baners buskede alle bown. I rede ?e praye ?one clergy sesse And aske þ? Bischoppe forgyfnesse And Absolucioun. And graunt hym graythely for to goo For to feghte appon goddis foo, Or loste es thi renownn.” 66 “In faithe,” saide þ? kynge, “I graunt.” The Bischoppe es gude &amp; on evynhaunt With Baners bryghte of hewe Be-fore þam a furlange &amp; mare. The kynge vndid his hede alle bare, The Bischoppe wele hym knewe, And appon his knees he knelid down And tuke his absolucyoun, theire Ioye by-gane to newe. 67 The kynge says: “haly fader free, This gilte I praye the forgyffe me And I will wirke ?our will. And with ?our clergye tournes agayne, Riste and Ryott ?ow by þ? water of sayne, Ay whills I come ?ow till.” The Bischoppe grauntis hym in þat tyde, And pyghte Pauylyons with mekill pryde, With wyne &amp; welthes at will. The kynge in to þ? Citee went And aftir his Baronage he sent, Alle forwardes to fulfill. 68 And by the thre wekes comen were Charls had semblede a faire powere, Hym selfe come all at hande. Erles, Dukes, &amp; þ? xij duchepers, Bothe barons and Bachelers, knyghtis full heuenhande. Thay offerde alle at seynt denys, And grete lordes to armes chesse, And Charls tuke his hande. And thus remewes that grete powere, The leuenynge of [þair] baners clere Lyghtenes all þat lande. [Tertius] Passus: a ffittt 69 Thus Charls with his cheualrye Vn to he come at lumbardy In no place wolde he hone. And to the Sara?enes was it tolde That Charls make werre appon þam wolde, To venge þat are was done. The grete lordes þan to gedir spake: “It is better þat we sir Garcy take, And Crownn hym þ? Sowdane Sone.” Than sent þay to many an hethyn knyghte, Þay badde þat alle solde come þat myghte, By þ? heghten day at none. 70 When þay were semblede sekerly, Thay Crownnede þ? Sowdane sir Garcy, Þat Solance was to see[ne]. Sexty knyghtis of dyuerse lande Ilkon sent hym sere presande To witt with owtten wene. Thay dressede on hym a dyademe, And made hym Emperour so hym seme, These knyghtis þat were kene. Syne present hym with golde, And Stones of vertu þat was holde, Þ? beste in erthe myghte bene. 71 The kynge of Massedoyne lande Sent þ? Sowdane a presande, Þ? Meryeste one molde: Sexty Maydyns faire of face, That cheffeste of his kyngdome was, And faireste appon folde: Sexty Fawconns faire of flyghte, And Sexti stedis noble and wyghte, In euer-ilke Iournay bolde. And appon Ilke a stede a knyghte sittande With a fawcon appon his hande, And a cowpe full of golde. 72 Sexty grewhondes vn to þ? gamen, And Sexti Raches rynnande in samen, Þ? beste in erthe myghte bee. He come hym selfe with this presande And broghte in his awenn hande, Þat was worthe thiese three: In visebill a full riche stone, A Safre þ? beste þat myghte be one To seke alle Crystiauntee. The Sowdane was full fayne of this, And kyndely gan his cosyn kysse With mekill solempnytee. 73 When he his powere semblede hade, A ryalle feste þ? Sowdan made Of worthy men in wede. Of alle þ? damesels bryghte &amp; schene Þ? Sowdane hade hym selfe I wene Þaire althere Maydynhede; By þam ilkone he laye a nyghte, And sythen Mariede hir vn-to a knyghte, Þay leffed one haythen lede. So mekill luste of lechery Was a-mange þat cheualry Þat þay [myg]hte noghte wele spede. 74 To Charls now will I torne agayne Þat passes ouer Mountayne &amp; playne, At [Me]layne wolde he bee; And when he come in to þat stede Where als þ? cristyn men by fore weren dede, Off Fraunce so grete plentee, There heghe appon an hill appon highte Turpyn garte an awtre dyghte, Þat alle þ? folke myghte See; And off the Trynytee a messe he says, And hertly for þ? saules he prayes, And the bodyes þat þare gan dye. 75 The Bischoppe sone gane hym reuesche, In gude entent he says a messe, In þe name of god almyghte: He blyssede þ? awtere with his hande, And a fayre oste of brede þer appon he fande, Þat euer he sawe with syghte. His chalesse was so full of wyne There myghte no more hafe gone þer in, It come fro heuen on highte. He dide his messe forthe to þ? ende And thankede gode þat it hym sende, And Marie his modir bryghte. 76 The Bischoppe in his hert was fayne And thankede god with all his mayne, And Marie his modir free. He tolde þ? hoste with lowde steuen, How brede &amp; wyne was sent fro heuen, Fro god of moste poustee: “And all þat euer hase sene this syghte ?ee are als clene of syn, I plyghte, Als þat day borne were ?ee. And who so endys in this felde In his byggynge sall he belde Euer more in blysse to bee.” 77 The Bischoppe þan keste of his abytte And aftir armours he askede tytte, For egernesse he loughe. A kirtill and a corsett fyne, Þer ouer he keste an acton syne, And it to hym he droughe: An hawbarke with a gesserante, His gloues weren gude &amp; auenaunte; And als blythe als birde one boughe He tuke his helme &amp; sythen his brande, Appon a stede a spere in hande, Was grete and gud ynoghe. 78 Sayse “I praye ?ow, all my cleregy here, Assembles vndire my Banere, The vawarde will I haue. Charls &amp; his knyghtis kene Lete Erles &amp; Barons with hym bene, Bothe Sqwyers &amp; knaue, I beseke freschely for to fyghte, That þ? [le]wede men may se with syghte, And gud Ensample haue. Standis [now baldly f]or ?oure trouthe; Appon ?o[ne Sara?en]es haues no rewthe; For golde in erthe, none saue.” 79 Thus Ch[arls led]eth a faire men?he For[th to Mela]yne, þat riche Cite, Braydes vp Baners ?are. And when þ? Sowdane hase þam sene, He comandes his knyghtis kene, Þat þay solde make þam ?are: And Or he wolde passe owte of þ? townn, He made his Offerande to Mahownn, þ? wars leue gode þay fare. And sythen owt of that Citee, Off heythen men an hugge men?hee Þat Semyde als breme als bare. 80 Sir Arabaunt, with Ire and hete, A Furlange bi-fore þ? Batelle grete, Come and askede fighte. And by-fore of oure folke had he slayne Bothe þ? lorde of Melayne And many an oþer knyght. Than sayde þ? Bischoppe:“so mot I spede, He sall noghte ruysse hym of this dede, If I cane rede a ryghte!” And or any knyght myght gete his gere The Bischoppe gart hym with a spere Appon his tepet lighte. 81 Turpyn strake hym so sekerly Thurgh þe breste bone all plenerly, A lange ?erde and more, That dede he daschede to þ? grounde, Grysely gronaunde in that stownde, Woundede wonderly sore. The Bischoppe þan lighte full apertly And off he hewes his hede in hy, Þat are was breme als bare. His horse vn to þ? Cristen Oste gan spede, A Sqwyere broghte agayne his stede, And one he leppe righte thare. 82 The Bischoppe sqwyere in the place Saw þat þ? kynge dede was Þat had bene of grete powere; His helme &amp; his hawberke holde, Frette ouere with rede golde, With stones of vertue dere; His gowere pendande on þ? grounde, It was worthe a thowsande pownde, Off rubys and Safere: He lowtede down, vp wolde itt ta, The Bischoppe bad hym fro it ga: “Go fonnge the anoþer fere. 83 To wyn the golde þou arte a fole, Þou bygynnes sone for to spoyle, Loo! ?onder comes moo. Thou settis more by a littill golde, Þat þou seese lye appon þ? molde, Þan to fighte one goddes foo. Loo! ?onder comes Sara?enes in þ? felde, Go kill þam down vndir thi schelde, Slyk [w]orchippes were gude to do.” He tuke þ? pendande in his hande, The Bishoppe bett hym with his brande [Þat] he keste it hym fro. 84 With þat come girdande sir Darnadowse, A nobill knyghte and a cheuallrouse, Prekande one a stede. He was þ? chefe of Famagose, A Sara?ene þat fayne wolde wyn lose, And to þ? Cristen oste gan spede. He bad sende owte Charlyon If he dare come to wynn pardoun A bofett for to bede. He wolde noghte fighte bot with a kynge, He calde hym selfe with owt lesynge The chefe of hethyn thede. 85 Then kyng Charls tuke his spere hym to, The Bischoppe Turpyn and oþer mo Prayede god solde hym spede. “A, dere lorde,” said Rowlande in heghe, “Late me fare to fighte for thee, For hym þat one rode gan blede.” Than Charls sweris by saynt paule: “Sen ilke a man feghtis for his saule I sall for myn do mede. Slayne in the felde gif þat I bee Kynge off Fraunce here make I the, With reghte þ? Reme to lede.” 86 Þan with owtten any more habade Theis two kynges to-gedir rade, With Ire and grete envy. And at þ? firste course þat þay ranne Thies kynges two with horse &amp; manne At þ? grounde bothe gun ly. Deliuerly vp sone bothe þay stirtt, And drewe þaire swerdis with noble hertt, With owtten noyse or cry. Thay dalt so derfely with þaire brandes, Thay hewe theire scheldis to þaire handis In cantells hyngand by. 87 So darfely bothe þaire dynttis þay driste A littill while þay wolde þam riste, Þ? Sara?ene prayede hym styntt: “Nowe, certis, sir,” he saide, “me rewes of thee A Cristynn man þat þou solde bee, thou arte so stronge of dyntt. Bot torne vn to oure lawes &amp; take þam to, And I sall gyffe the rewmes two, And elles will þou harmes hentt.” Bot þ? Bischoppe Turpyn þan cryes on heghte: “A! Charles, thynk appon Marie brighte, To whayme oure lufe es lentt. 88 And if euer þat þou hade any myghte, Latt it nowe be sene in syghte, What pouste þat þou hase. Latte neuer oure kynge with dynt of brande B[e] slayne with ?one Sara?ene hande, Ne ende, lady, in this Place. A [God] wote we sall be safe, [Neuer] the lyk wolde we hafe Of oure comly kynge of face. [Þou ma]kere bathe of son and see, [Pity t]he dole w[e d]ree for thee, And graunte vs of thi grace!” 89 [Charls] saide:“sir Bischoppe, nay, [Neuer sall I] forsake my lay:” And to-gedir gan þay goo. So stiffely aythere at othere strake, Appon his helme sir Charles brake His nobill swerde in two. Bot þan the franche folke with nobill steuenn, Thay cry vp vn to þ? kynge of heuenn, And for þaire lorde were wo. The Sara?ene was curtays in þat fighte And lawses owt a knyfe full righte, His swerde he keste hym fro. 90 And Charles voydede his broken brande, Owte he hent a knyfe in hande, And Samen þay wente full tytte. Thay daschede full darfely with þaire dynt, Mighte no steryn stele þam stynt, So styffely bothe þay smyte. In sondre braste þay many a mayle, Thaire hawberghes thurgh force gan fayle: To see had lordis delitte. Bot a felle stroke sir Charls gafe hym one Evyn at þ? breste bone, Þat strake his hert gan blende. 91 The Sara?ene was dede of þat strake, And Charls gan this fende vp take, And with his awenn brande He broches hym so boldely That his hert blode sekerly rane to oure kynges hande. And thare he wane þ? sara?ene swerde, And certis þat with one the erthe He conquered many a lande. The Cristen folke were neuer so fayne; Bot by the kynge was horsede agayne Þ? Batells were doande. 92 And hawberkes sone in schredis were schorne, And beryns thorowe the bodys borne, And many a sara?ene slayne. Knyghtis one þ? bent bledis, Many lay stekede vndir stedis, In gilten gere full gay[n]e: Other with glafes were girde thurgh evyn: We may thanke gode þat is in heuen Þat lent vs myghte &amp; mayne. Thay sloughe þam downn with swerdis bright, Þ? Cristynnes faughte in goddis righte, Þ? Bischoppe loughe for fayne. 93 Bot, als þ? Cronakill ?itt will telle, Þer come a sara?ene fers and felle And to þ? Bischoppe glade. And stroke hym righte thorowe þ? thee, And agayne to þ? hethen oste gane flee, And Turpyn after hym rade. The Bischoppe folouede hym so ferre Þat þ? sara?ene hade þ? werre For þ? maystrie þat he [made]. He stroke hym so in þ? sowdane syghte, He fande neuer man þat after myghte Hele þ? hurt [he had]e. 94 Bot they helde In þ? Bischoppe in þat rowtte Þat he ne myghte noghte wyn owte, And þer he [was doande]. The kynge of Massedoyne land with a spere, Þ? Bischope fro his horse gane bere, And sette [on hym his hande] The sara?enes sware he solde be dede, And þ? kynge sayde, “naye,” in that stede For no Sara?ene liffande. And righte als þay solde oure Bischoppe slo, Thay smote þ? kynge of Massaydoyne fro Clenly of his reghte hande. 95 Bot þan kynges men of Massaydoyne weren wo, When þay saughe þaire lorde was wondede soo, And trowede he walde be dede. Thay Braydede owte swerdes full bryghte Agaynes þ? Sowdane folke to fighte, Full styffely in þat stede: For that gane fyfetene thowsande? dy Of þ? Sowdans cheualry, Laye bledande þan full rede. And with þat Turpyn gatt a-waye To Charls Oste, full fayne were þay, A horse þay to hym lede. 96 Bot when þ? Bischoppe was horsede agayne, Alle þ? cleregy weren full fayne, And presede in to þ? place. So depe wondes þat day þay dalt, Þat many on wyde opyn walt, Þat wikkidly wondede was. Thay sloughe so many an heythen kynge Þat at þ? laste þay tuke to flyinge, Als god vs gaffe þ? grace. Many a Sara?ene garte þay falle, And Turpyn with his Clergy alle Folowede faste one þ? chase. 97 And Charls on þ? toþer syde Sloughe þam downn with wondis wyde, the doughty garte þay dy. The Sowdane hym selfe so harde was stedde Þat with Ten thowsande a-way he fledde, And faste to Melayne gatt he. The Cristen men chasede þam to þ? barres, And sloughe righte there fele folke &amp; fresche, All þat þere walde byde &amp; bee. Bot þan kynge Charls tuke þ? playne And Semblede all his folke a-gayne, To luke how beste myghte [þe]. 98 Thay myghte noghte þ? Cite wynn, The strenghe of þ? Sara?enes þat were with-In. Þe Bischoppe said:“I rede Of oure knyghtes in þ? felde es many wondede vndir schelde, And also some are dede; And ?one Sara?enes full of tresone es, There I concelle bothe more &amp; lesse We stirre noghte of this stede, Ne or to-morne serche neuer a wounde, Bot luke þan who may be sownde; Lete Criste wirke:” &amp; forthe he ?ede. 99 Here to a[c]ordes euerilkon, Lordes [haf] þaire horses tone, And Comen es the nyghte. Fo[r alle] þ? Sara?enes there Th[ay ne mygh]te no forthir fare, Bot bydis in brenys bryghte. Ch[arles acordede] als þay rade, All [nyghte on]e þe bent þay bade With standardes euen vp streghte. The kynge prayede the Bischoppe fre His wonde þat he wolde late hym see, Þat he hade tane in þat fighte. 100 Bot þ? Bischoppe saide:“a vowe to god make I here, There sall no salue my wonde come nere, Ne no hose of my thee: Ne mete ne drynke my hede come In, The Cite of Melayne or we it wyn, Or ells þer fore to dye.” He garte dele his vetells then Firste amanges oure wonded men, Bot no mete neghe wolde hee. Bot als so sore wondede als he was, Knelande he his prayers mase To gode of moste Pouste. 101 Oure folke hade done so doughtily That many of þam weren ful wery, So hade þay foghten þan. Bot one þ? morne þ? Cristen stode A thowsande ouer theire fete in theire blode Of theire awenn wondes wane. Othere refreschynge noghte many hade Bot blody water of a slade, Þat thurghe þ? Oste ran. The Sowdane sent a Messangere To kynge Charles als ?e may here, And that sawe many a man. 102 Þ? Messangere bare a wande Of ane Olefe in his hande, In takynnynge he come of pece. And lowde he cryede appon Charls þ? kynge, And saide he myghte his handis wrynge, “Appon lyfe if þat he es: For oure Sowdane hase by Mahownn sworne Þat he salle mete hym here to-morne, With full prowde men in prese: With fowrty thowsande of helmes bryghte, Was neuer ?itt frekkere men to fighte Sene in hethynnesse.” 103 And Charles ansuerde at þat tide: “In faythe I sall þam here habyde Wode giffe þat þay were. If þat he brynge alle þ? Sara?enes Þat es alle heythynnesse with-In, Hyne will I noghte fare.” The Messangere agayne þan rade, And they sett wache and still habade Whills Pryme was passede &amp; mare. Bot or þ? nonee neghede nee, To þam þan soughte a felle semble With Baners breme als bare. 104 Bot than sir Charles spekes full gudely To Rowlande his nevewe þat stode hym by, And seid; “sir, so god the spede, This day wirke þou Manfully With thi nobill Cheualry, And of þ? Sara?ens hafe [no dre]de. Thou sall see þat I sall noghte be sparede, My selfe sall haue the vawarde, There Iesu [Crist þe sp]ede.” The trumpetes trynes one righte þan, To Ioyne so Iolyly thay by-gane, Oure worthy men in wede. 105 Thay ruysschede Samen with swilke a rake That many a Sara?ene laye on his bake, &amp; one þ? lawnde righte þer þay lay; Full Grisely gronande one the grete, Stekyde vndir stedis fete, And liste no thynge of playe. So darfely þan þay dynge þam downn, Thay saide þ? myghte of saynt Mahownn Was clenely all a-waye. “A! mount Ioye!” oure lordes gane crye, And Charles with his cheualrye Full freschely faughte þat day. 106 They hewe of hethen hedis in hye, Oure Cristen men so sekirly Of þam hade littill drede, Bot brittenesse þam with brandis bare And Sara?enes thurghe þ? schuldire schare, þat to þ? girdill it ?ede. Thay tuke none hede of gudes nore golde, Lay neuer so mekill appon the molde, Oure worthy men in wede; Bot beris abake the Batells brade, Fowrty thowsande in a slade, Laye stekede vnder stede. 107 And so harde by-stade was þ? Sowdane Hym selfe with ten thowsande þan To Melayne tuke þ? gate. Oure Cristen knyghtis with þaire speres The hyndirmaste fro þaire blonkes beres, And chacede þam to þ? ?ate. The owte barres hew þay downn, And slewe hethynn kynges with crownn, And þaire powere þer-ate. To sawtte þ? Cite sadly þay by-gann, Off Cristyn men many a cruelle man, Þ? hethyn wex all mate. 108 With speris &amp; with spryngaldes faste, With dartis kenely owte þay caste, Bothe with myghte &amp; mayne. With gownnes &amp; with grete stones Graythe gounnes stoppede those gones With peletes vs to payne. Oure Cristyn men that were of price Bendis vp bowes of devyce, And Bekirs þam agayne. Appon bothe the sydis so freschely þay fighte That by it drewe vn to the nyghte Fele folke of fraunce were slayne. 109 There were of oure clergy dede And oþer lordes in þat stede, Or thay of sawte walde sesse. By þan þay sawe it was no bote to byde And fro þ? Cite warde þay ryde, Oure prynces prouede in presse. The Bischoppe es so woundede that tyde With a spere thorowe owte the syde, Þat one his ribbis gan rese. Thurgh þ? schelde &amp; the browe bare A schaftemonde of his flesche he schare: lordynges, þis es no lese. 110 He pullede it owte, keste it hym fro, And weryde þ? handis þat it come fro, And þat it lete forthe glyde. The Sowdane ouer þe wallis by-helde And sawe þ? Cristen in the felde Frowarde þ? Cite ride. And appon kynge Charls þan cryes he: “What! Charls, thynkes now to flee? I trowe the moste habyde. I sall the mete to-morne in felde, With fourty thowsand vnder schelde, Sall fonde to felle thi pryde.” 111 Says Charls: “þou false hethyn hownde, Thou ne dare noghte byde appon þ? grounde, Þer euer more worthe the woo Bot aythire of thies dayes Ilyke Hase þou stollen a waye lyke a tyke, The deuelle myghte with þ goo! That Cite bot þou ?elde to me, And fully trowe and Cristyn be Appon one god and no moo, In felde ?if euer I see the mare I sall by myghtfull god” he sware, “Hewe thi bakke in twoo.” 112 Then of oure Cristen men in þ? felde Many semblede vnder schelde, And some ware wondede sare. Thay þat were bothe hale &amp; sownde Comforthed þam þat were euyll wonde, So als Criste wolde it were. The kynge þan of his helme tase, And to the Bischoppe swythe he gase And sayde: “Fadir, for goddes are, Thy woundes that thou walde late me see, If any Surgeoun myghte helpe thee, My comforthe were þ? mare.” 113 “What! wenys þou, Charls,” he said, “þat I faynte bee For a spere was in my thee, A glace thorowte my syde. Criste for me sufferde mare; He askede no salue to his sare, Ne no more sall I this tyde. I sall neuer ette ne drynke, Ne with myn eghe slepe a wynke, Whate bale als euer I byde, To ?one Cite ?olden bee, Or ells þer-fore in Batelle dye, The sothe is noghte to hyde.” 114 Als þay stode spekande of þis thynge, To Charls come a newe tydynge Þat Blenkede all his blee: Thay saide þat one sir Tretigon, Þat was þ? Sowdane syster son, And þ? beste of Barbarye,— “Certys, Charls, he comes at hande With men of armes a sexty thowsande, To strenghe with ?one Cite.” 115A leaf seems to be missing here. The French being hard pressed, Charles wishes one of his knights to ride off to France for help. “Now sone, when I hafe foughten my fill, I sall avise me gif þat I will One thi message to wende.” 116 “Now sir Bawdewyne, buske, &amp; make þ? bownn.” He saide: “allas, þou charelyonn, Þat euer I tuke thi fee! For ?itt my selfe es saffe &amp; sownnde, My body hole with owttyn wounde, Als þou thi selfe may see; I walde noghte, for all thi kyngdome, Þat euer þat worde vn-to france come I solde so feyntly flee. Gett the a currour whare þou may, For, by god þat awe this day, Þou sall haue none of mee.” 117 “A, sir Ingelere, for a knyghte þou art kyde,” “Whi, sir Charls, what walde þou þat I dide? “I pray the wende thi waye.” “Bi Iesu Criste þat sittis aboffe, Me thynke þou kydde me littill luffe, When þou þat worde wolde saye. Bot me sall neuer be-tyde þat taynte: I hope þou wenys myn herte be feynte, I say þ? schortly, naye: Þat I sall neuer so fremdly flee, God lett me ?if it his wills bee Neuer habyde þat daye.” 118 The Duke Berarde was wondede sare, Thurgh þ? schelde into þ? Body bare He was borne with a brande. Of this message þay gun hym frayne, bot he hade no worde to speke agayne, Bot grymly stude lukande. Than Turpyn gan to Charls say: “Here arte þou seruede, bi my fay, Þou fayles of þat þou fande. The Duke es woundede so wonder sare It ware grete syn to greue hym mare; Gude sir, þou late hym stande.” 119 Thay prayede a Banarett þan of pryce, One sir Barnarde of Parische, For grete gyftis he wolde wende. And he saide: “lordynges, by my faye, I ame ouer symple to ?ow to saye, Where euer ?e will me sende. I aske ordir of knyghte þer till; Bot giffe ?our giftis where ?e will, Elles ?e be my frende.” Thay made hym knyghte with full gud chere, He tuke leue at þ? twelue du?epere this curtayse knyghte &amp; he[nde]. 120 He saide þan: “haue guddaye, Charls, in this stede, For þou sall neuer gyffe me brede, Ne in thy burdynge say, If I be pore of golde and fee, Þat I fro this grete Iournee Fayntly fledde a way.” He rydis euen to þ? ?atis of Melayne And there with sara?enes was he slayne, He dide full wele þat day. And Charls for hym in hert was woo, Bischoppe Turpyn and othere moo For his dede sore mournede thay. 121 Thus haue þay prayede euerylkone, Bot there wolde goo neuer one, The symple thay bade none sende. The Bischoppe Turpyn cryede appon highte: “Sen ?e are so frekke for to fighte God of his myghte ?ow mende! ?itt are we ten thowsande here That are ?itt bothe hole and fere, Þat wele for kene are kende. And of gude men þat none will flee, To fourty thowsande or we dye In þ? felde to make þaire ende.” 122 Bot als Turpyn lengs hym on his brande Ouer an hill he saw comande ful many a brade Banere, The Duke of Bretayne, sir lyonelle, That Charls was thare he herde telle And hade mystere of powere. He broghte hym thirty thowsande fyne, Vetaylls gude and nobill engyne, This bolde with full blythe chere, Than Turpyn gan to Charls say: “I see a felle hoste, bi my fay, Þat sone will neghe vs nere. 123 ?one are the sara?enes mekill of mayne, The full powere owt of spayne, Þat sone sall full ill spede. For by hym þat swelt on tree This day no sara?ene sall I see Sall gerre me torne my stede.” And In his hande he caughte a launce:— “Haue gud day, Charls, and grete wele fraunce.”— &amp; agayne þat hoste he ?ede. In fewter sone he keste his spere And thoghte the Boldeste down to bere Þat Batelle walde hym bede. 124 So blody was that Bischoppis wede His conysaunce ne ?it his stede Þ? Bretons ne couthe noghte knawe. Bot als an harawde hym by-helde He lukede vp in to his schelde, And sayde to alle one rawe: “If Bischoppe Turpyn appon lyve be, In faythe, lordynges, ?one es he Þat ?e se hedirwarde drawe.” Thay ferlyde why he fewterde his spere, “A Mounte Ioye,” cryes one þat he myghte here, He was glade of þat sawe. 125 The Wardayne rydis hym agayne And said: “sir Bischoppe, for goddis payne, Who hase greued the?” He tuke his spere owt of reste adownn And gaffe þam alle his Benysonn, the Bretons when he þam see. The Bischoppe tolde þam of his care Bot þan the Bretons hertis were sare, For þe dole oure Oste gun dryee. A Messangere went to telle the kynge, So fayne was Charles neuer of thynge With eghe þat he gan see. 126 And or Turpyn myghte his tale halfe telle He sawe come houande ouer a felle Many a brade Banere; Standardis grete with stalworthe men, Sexti thowsande wele myghte þay ben, In brenyes burnescht clere. Vnder þ? cante of a hille Oure Bretons beldis &amp; bydis stille, When þay wiste whate þay were. The Bischoppe saide: “bi goddis myghte, Thaym sall rewe or it be nyghte, the tyme þat þay come here! 127 Go we to ?one company With ‘Mountioye’ baldly &amp; þam ascrye, Late þer be no Lettynge.” An hawrawde said: “to fewe are we To fighte with slyke a grete men?e, It is better wende to þ? kynge.” “A, sir, whare þay are sexti thowsande men! And if þay were mo bi thowsandis ten, [Bi] God þat made all thynge, The more powere that thay be, The more honour wyn sall we, We dowte noghte þam to dynge.” 128 The Bischoppe to þ? kyng sent And prayes hym to byde appon þ? bent, Þ? Cite for to kepe; That there no sara?ene solde come owte, To þay had rekkenede with þat rowte, Þay sawe come ouere þ? depe. Oure Bretons kyndely comforthes he, Sayse: “alle þ Sara?enes ?e ?onder see Þaire frendis sore may wepe: We sall wirke þam wondis full wyde, I hete þam be þaire lemans syde Sowndely neuer sall þay slepe.” 129 For Isschuynge owte of þ? Cite kynge Charles with his men?e Helde his Batelle still. Oure Bretons bolde þat fresche come In Thoghte þat þay wolde wirchippe wyn And gatt þ? cante of þ? hill. The Sara?enes were so strange &amp; stowte Thay late no lede þat þay wolde lowte, Þay were so wykkede of w[ill]. Oure Bretons dide so doughtyly That lange or none sekerly Þ? sara?enes lykede full ill. 130 Samen þan strake þat grete stowre Als it were aftire þ? none ane houre, It was noghte mekills mare: Bot Many a sara?ene in þat stownde Lay grysely gronande on the grownde, Woundede wonderly sore. Bot there god will helpe þer es no lett; So stronge strokes þay one þam sett With burneschede bladis bare, That fourty thowsande sara?enes kene With Brandis lay brettenyde on the grene, So bolde oure Bretons were. 131 And to þ? Cite þe toþer wolde haue flede, And Rowlande thoghte he wolde þam stedde, Ten thowsande was with hym. And when he with the sara?enes mett, Full grym strokes he ouer þam sett, With growndyn speris and grym. Charles appon þ? tothere syde Sloughe þam downn with wondis wyde, And made þaire dedis full dyme. And thus thay chase þam here and thare, Als þ? howndes dose the hare, And refte þam lyfe and lyme. 132 Rowlande rydis to Letygon, Þat was þ? sowdane Sister sone, And stroke hym with a spere, That dede he daschede in þ? felde: Helme ne hawberke he myghte none welde, Ne neuer after none bere. Of sexti thowsande, sothely to say, Passede neuer one qwyke a way, Bot euyll þay endide there. The Cristenyde knelide down in þat place And thankede god þat gaffe þam grace, So worthily þam to were. 133 The false in þ? felde thus gun þay felle, The kynge callede sir lyonelle, And a-vauntede hym full heghe. The Duke of Burgoyne bi-fore was dede, He Sessede hym in his stede, And gafe hym his doughter free. And to þ? Bischoppe þan swythe he gase, That wery and sore wondede was, And fastande dayes three: Be þat tyme he myghte note wele a worde owt-wyn, The teris rane ouer Charles chynn, Þat Sorowe it was to See: 134 “And þou dy, þan dare I saye The floure of presthode es a-waye, Þat euer hade schauen crownn. For there ne is kynge ne Cardynere In Cristyndome may be thi pere, Ne man of Religiownn.” He will no man his wondes late See, Ne mete ne drynke none neghe hym ne, For prayer ne for pardownn. Oure Oste for þ? Bishcoppe mournes alle, And graythes þam to Melayne walle, With Baners buskede bownn. 135 New vetailles þ? bretons broghte þan Þat refresschede many of oure men, Of brede, brawne &amp; wyne. A nobill hurdas ther was graythede And Baners to þ? walles displayede, And Bendis vp þaire engyne. Þ? Romance Of Duke Rowlande and of Sir Ottuell of Spayne. Off Cherlls of Fraunce. 1 Lordynges, þat bene hende and Free, Herkyns alle hedir-wardes to mee, Gif þat it be ?our will. Now lates alle ?our nyose be, And herkyns nowe of gamen &amp; glee, Þat I schall tell ?ow till. Of doghety men I schall ?ow telle, Þat were full fayre of flesche &amp; fell, And Semely appon Sille. And with þaire wapyns wele couthe melle, And boldly durste in batell duelle, And doghety proued one hill. 2 The sone of le Roy Pepyn, Þat was sir Cherlles gud &amp; fyne, Als þ? cronykills vs gan say, With his dusperes doghety and dym Þat wele couthe feghte with a Sara?ene, For to felle þam fey. Till Genyone with his traytorye Solde þam ille and wikkedly Vn-to þ? false ley: Fourty thowsande and fyfty Of þ? flour of cheualrye there dyede apon a daye. 3 Mynstrells in þat lande gan duelle, Bot alle þ? sothe þay couthe noghte tell Of this noble cheualrye. How þat Cherlles with his swerde gan melle, Bot suche a Menske hym be-fell Þat come hym Sodeynly. They tentede to þaire daunsynge And also to þaire othir thynge, to make gamen &amp; glee. Burdours in to þ? haulle þay brynge, Þat gayly with þaire gle gan synge, With wowynges of lady. 4 And forthir in Romance als ?e mon here; This noble kynge of grete powere Duellede in pariche, With his lordes and his Duspers, Þat were holden felle &amp; fers And in Batelle full wyse. All þay buskede þam for to bere Helme &amp; hawberke, schelde &amp; spere, And rapede þam for to ryse, Agaynes kynge Merthill for to were, And for to kepe þ? heythyn here, &amp; struye there goddes Enymys. 5 Bot now come þam newe note one hande And wondirfull hasty tythande, Þat greuede þam righte Sore. For of þ? cheuallrye of the lande Þer hade dyede thritty thousande, Gif goddes helpe ne wore. And owte of Spayne there come in hy A Sara?ene þat was full doghety, With grymly grownden gare, Fro þ?

And there he metys in that tyde Þat were faire of hewe and hide, thre full noble knyghtis: Sir Otes and sir Raynere, Duke Naymes was theire fere, Þat ofte þaire resouns rightes. He haylsede þam with steryn chere, Sayd: “fro þ? kynge am I sent a Messangere Þat moste es prouede of myghtis.” 7 Duke Naymes sayde full curtaysly: “Sir, whate may thi name bee?” He sayde: “I highte Otuell. kyng Cherlles where es he? Righte to hym by-houede mee Mi message for to telle.” Duke Naymes saide: “he sittes his duspers Imange, With white berde large and lange, Faire of flesche &amp; fell. With a floreschede thonwange, Oure noble kynge þat es so strange, His doghety men I-melle. 8 He sittes in riche meneuere, Þ? Duke Rowlande sittys hym nere In rede Siclaton. And þ? gentille Erle sir Olyuere, Þat es full noble &amp; felle &amp; fere, &amp; in Batelle ay full bowun.” Forthe passede than the Messangere Bi-fore þ? kynge with steryn chere, It was hym grete renoun. He saide: “Ane euyll flawmandre fyre Bryne þ? berde, þ? breste, &amp; þ? swyre, Euen to þ? fote alle doun! 9 A Messangere Ame I sent hy Fro my lorde þ? Emperour sir Garey, Þat Settis ?ow alle at noghte. In Paynym ne es none so doghety, He hathe the flour of cheuallrye All redy with hym broghte. Charlles I ne maye noghte honour the, For þou hase greuede Mahoun &amp; me, Þat alle þis worlde hase wroghte. And, Rowlande, if euer I may the see At Batayle or at any Semble, thi dedis schall dere be boghte. 10 And, Rowlande, gif euer I maye þ? mete, With my swerde I schall the hete, to-hewe thi body in two; And fulle the vnder my horse fete, Sara?enes myrthe with the to bete, For þou hase wroghte þam woo.” And Rowlande at those wordes loughe, &amp; said: “sir, þou arte doghety ynoghe Siche dedis to vndir-too. Þou may Iangill &amp; make it toughe, For here schall no man do the woghe, till aughte dayes ben a-goo.” 11 Þ? kyng spekis þan the Sara?ene till: “Say one, felawe, whatte thou will, Distroube the schall ri?te none. Ne none of my men lowde nor still touche the with nonekyns ille, till heghte dayes ben gone.” Þ? Sara?ene at those wordes hadde skorne: “I dowte no man,” he says, “þat euer was borne, &amp; I my stede hafe tone: Corsu my swerde me bi-forne, Þat myche cristen blode hathe schorne, &amp; many a body slone.” 12 “Where?” sayde þ? kynge in hy. “Sir, in þ? playnes of lumbardy, Þou claymes it for þ? lande.

My selfe was þer in Batelle &amp; faughte, Myn neffes were bolnede dayes aughte, þat Selly was to see.” Vp þan stirte ane hardy knyghte, sir Estut of logres for sothe he highte, A lorde of grete bountee: With the Sara?ene wolde he fighte, A staffe in hande he takes hym righte, Was of Sqwarede tree. 14 Than Rowlande sayde full sobirly; “Now gud sir Estut, let it be, He es a Messangere: He es Ensurede to myn Eme &amp; mee. For-thi, gud sir, par charyte, thyn hert þat þou wolde stere.” Bot ?it þ? knyghte ne wolde noghte spare, Bot hent þ? Sara?ene by þ? hare, &amp; backwarde doun hym bere. Þ?

He braundesch[e]t his swerde bare, Þat trenchande was &amp; wele schare, And sayde full sobirly, And by his grete Mahown he sware: “And any of ?ow duspers stirre þare þ? beste party schall dy!” 16 Þ? kyng his men sone Sessed he, Sayd:“Sara?ene, ?elde thi suerde to mee, &amp; late be alle this bere.” &amp; he sayde:“naye, als mot I the.” Vp þan rose sir Rowlande full Sobirly, &amp; with a lagheande chere Said:“?elde to me thi brande brighte, I schall the saue, als I ame knyghte, Whills þat þou arte here; And when thi Message es doun &amp; dighte, I schall delyuer the thi brande so brighte, Als I am trewe duspere.” 17 “In þat conande I ?elde it the; I nolde gif it for twelue Cite, So bittirly will it bite. And, Rowlande, ?if euer I may the see At batayle or at any Semble, Þ? hede of þer-with to smyte.” Rowlande sayde: “sir, þou art to outrage: Fayrere myghte þou batayll wage þan all daye thus to chide.” Þ? Sara?ene spake with stowte vesage: “Herkenys now to my message, &amp; I schall tell ?ow tyte:— 18 kyng Cherlls, als þou may here, I am sent a Messangere fro hym þat es doghty. He weldes Paynym ferre &amp; nere, Alysaundere of grete powere, &amp; þ? londis of Boty: Toures, Sedoyne ferre &amp; fre, Perse, semely one to see, &amp; þerto fermorye.

Olyuer þat es faire and free, the knyghte es prouede of grete bounte, Þ? landes of Scamonye; 21 To sir Florance of Surry He hathe giffen Fraunce in hye, Þat wele cane prike a stede, Þ? kyng[es] sone of Barbarye, To hafe it to his Bayly, Þer-one his life to lede.” Than the kynge sayde: “nay, Dus[e]pers, whate will ?e say Of this wonder dede? Schall neuer Sara?ene of heythyn ley Welde France by nyghte ne daye; Now Iesu it for-bede!” 22 Þen þay ansuerde sone in hye: “Nay, sir, we will oure batells guy, And rape vs for to ryde Agayne þ? Emperour sir Garcy. thurgh þ? myghte of mylde marye Hym schall schome be-tyde.” the Sara?yn laughes full smothirly: “What! threte ?e now sir Garcy With ?our boste &amp; ?our pryde? ther es none of ?ow so hardy, And ?e hade sene his cheualry, ?our hedis þat ye nolde hyde.” 23 Þ? Duke Naymes talkes wordes one highte, says: “sir, if þat þ? Emperour will fighte, We schall to hym full euen.” Þ? Sara?ene ansuerde with mekill myghte; “He hath a hondreth thousande helmys brighte, &amp; þer-to hundrethes Seuen. Þer es no kyng in Cristyante Dare warne hym huntynge &amp; fischynge fre, Ne discrye hym þer with steuen. Bi-twix two watirs fayre &amp; fre He hath bigged a Cite hight attayle, es none siche vnder þ? heuen. 24 Cherlles, with thi longe berde, Þat Emperoure schall make þ? full ferde With his stronge powere: For he hathe men in Batell lerede, Þat wele kon feghte with floresched swerde, &amp; hafe lemans full clere. Lete Duke Naymes lenge at hame To kepe pareche walles fro schame, Þat no gledes neghe þam nere; Coo ne pye that there come none, For cheualrye es fro hym gone, A nolde nappere als he were.” 25 Þ? Duke Naymes asschamede was, Þ? blode stert vp in his face, A-greued he was full sore. Þan sir Rowlande full rathely vp he rase: “Vnconnande Sara?ene,” he said, “in þis place Þ? wykkednes es ?are. By hym þat dyede appon a tree, Þou scholde haue a velany of me, Ensurede nyfe þat I ware! Bot in Batelle if euer I may þ? see, Schall neuer no kyng of Cristyante Be encombirde with the mare.” 26 the Sara?ene ansueres full stoutly: “Be Mahownn, Rowlande, I ame redy For to fighte with the. In to ?one Medowe I rede we hye, And luke þat no man bee vs by, Grete gamen þan schall men see. Whethir oo werse es of vs twoo lett hewe bothe his spourres hym froo, He neuer more honourede bee.” Rowlande was of hert full throo Siche dedys to vnder-too, His hande vp holdes hee. 27 “Sir Vernague of Barabas, Sertys myn [eme] I wote he was, Þat Rowlande here hath slayne: I chalange his dethe now in þis place, I schalle þ? lede a wikkede pase, Bothe with myghte &amp; mayne.” Þ? kynge at those wordes loughe &amp; said: “sir, þou arte doghty ynoghe:” Garte calle a chambirlayne, Garte delyuere hym Innes withowtten woghe: “To serue hym lokes þat ?e bene toughe, Of alle þat scholde hym gayne.” 28 The kynge garte calle sir Grauntere, Sir Raynere and sir Oggere, bade take kepe of the knyghte. One þ? Morne þay rose alle in fers, The abbott of Saynte Thomers Songe þam a messe full righte. Elleuen coupes fayre to fonde Was Offrede at þ? Abbottes honde, Full of golde so brighte. Rowlande Offrede Droundale his brande, Boghte it agayne with golde at hande; Alle Honoured þay god alle myghte. A fitt. 29 And vnnethes was þ? Messe alle done, When þat þ?Sara?ene come full sone, And cryed appon highte to kyng Cherlles with steryn tone, Sayd: “send owte Rowlande withowtten hone I calle hym recreyande knyghte. I appelle hym for trouthe broken, For þ? wordes þat were spoken ?istreuen within þ? nyghte. In his armes þat he be loken Myn Emes dethe I will hafe wroken, he was a kynge of myghte.” 30 Eleuen duspers stode hym by To arme sir Rowlande full hastyly, Þat prouede was in Batayle. An actone thay threwe appon hym hye And ane hawberke sekerly, Þat sekire was of Mayle: Hose of hawberke Gesseraunte, Broghte hym ane helme of bettant, &amp; lacede his auentale. Iche a knyghte gane þam a-vaunte, For to serue hym to his avenaunte, Þat no thynge scholde hym fayle. 31 Þay spende hym with his gilte sperres, And dressede hym in his armours, Alle redy to the felde: Broghte hym a schelde of faire-coloure: he was a lofely creatoure, Who so hym þan bi-helde. Girde hym with Droundale to þ? were: Appone a stede he leppes there, Þat doghety vnder schelde; And in his hande a noble spere, A faire course he rydes there Hys wapyns for to welde. 32 Then sayde Cherlles þ? kynge; “Loke rekreyande þou hym brynge Þat hathe made þis derraye: late hym noghte skape for nonkynsthynge.” he gaffe hym goddes blyssynge &amp; bade hym wende his waye. Þay broghte þam by-twene two watirs brighte— Sayne, and Meryn le graunte, þay highte, Als þ? bukes gan vs saye— In to a Medowe Semely to sighte, there als these doghety men solde fighte With-owtten more delaye. 33 Þis while houede the Sara?ene still And called to þ? kynge with voyce full schrylle: “Ane hawberke aske I the; Spere and schelde garre brynge me till, For I hafe horssynge at my will, None siche in Cristyante.” Þ? kyng þan lokes hym be-syde And saughe his dogheter mekill of pryde, Belesent, brighte of blee; Þan he comandide hir that tyde: “Goo take hym fayre be thi syde Wele armede þat he bee.” 34 And scho calles Flores of Maundelle, Mayden Roselet of Barelle, &amp; bade þam wende to þ?knyghte, And haste þam þat with-in a while. And til a chambire gan þay syle, And gayly gan hym dighte. to arme hym wele þay were full snelle, Ouer his aktone ane hawberke felle Of colours þat were brighte, Þat aughte gud kynge Ragnell, Þat was bothe ferse and felle &amp; in felde full faire couthe fighte. 35 Þay armede hym wele with-owtten fayle, With golde þay lacede his auentaile For þat it solde be trewe; Brothte hym ane helme of riche entayle, Of precyouse stanes þ? appayrayle, Þat brighteste was of hewe, His helme was bothe harde and holde, ther-one was sett a Sercle of golde Þat bett was wonder newe. then sayde thies Damesels fre one folde, A Meryere armede knyghte one molde Neuer ?itt þay ne knewe. 36 Þay broghte hym a Schelde when he was bownn, theis Maydens two þay broghte hym downn, He cried aftir his stede. He rollede his eghne vp and downn, And sware by his grete Mahoun his Enemy sore myghte drede. Þan spake those two Maydens smale: “sir, kepe the wele fro Drondale, For it will garre the blede. Entyre þou ones in to ?one vale, Comes þou neuer aftyr in to this sale, And sir Rowlande righte may rede.” 37 He toke his leue &amp; forthe he gose, lepe one a stede highte Mekredose, in his hande a spere. A faire course he rydes close Full egerly amonges his fose, &amp; dressede hym in his gere. When þ? Sara?ene commen was, the kyng garte sone a-voyde þ? place, Of Cristen þat there were. to þ? castelle he wendes a pase And appone þ? kirnells gase, to wayte appon þat were. 38 the kynge to Rowlande lowde gan crye: “Feghte one, dere Sone, hardely, In þ? name of Marie of Heuen.” the Sara?ene saide: “I ame redy.” Appon sir Rowlande he gan defy With a full hawtayne steuen. thies kene knyghtis to-gedir gan glide, the Medowe tremlyde one aythir syde, In scheldes þay cowped full euen. theyre Ioynynge was so harde that tyde that theyre tymbir in sondire gan ryde, In mo þan sex or seuen. 39 thurgh-owte þaire scheldis þan þay schare And all þ? lethirs þat þare ware Þay assembled soryly. the poyntes appon þ?hawberke bare Bot þ? mayles so sekir ware, Þ? spere hedis bi-gan to plye. Rowlande owte his swerde wanne And hittes hym on þ? helme thanne, Þat þ? Nasell floghe full hye. thurgh þ? horse schu[l]dirs þ? swerde rane, Þat was a styffe stroke of a man, His noble stede gan dy. 40 the Sara?ene of his horse tumblys doun And stert vp fers als any lyoun, And Cursu his swerde he drewe. he brasede his Schelde &amp; made hym bowun, he hitt sir Rowlande one þ? crowun Þat fore Egirnes he loughe. the Nasell of his helme of-glade Dowun bi-fore hym in the strade, hade almoste wroghte hym woghe. thurgh þ? horse schuldirs þ? swerde gan wade, his stede euen in Sondere he hade, Þ? stroke was stythe ynoghe. 41 Rowlande one þ? grownde es lighte, Vppon his fete he sterte vp righte, His swerde in his hande he helde. Þ? Sara?ene cryed with mekill myghte: “Þis was a stythe stroke of a knyghte, &amp; no thynge of a childe!” Charlles herde those wordes wele, Appon his knees downn gan he knele &amp; bothe his handes vp helde: “God,” he said, “þat alle schall dighte &amp; dele, his Modir mylde, and Saynt Michael, Fro schame ?e Rowlande schelde.!” 42 Rowlande raysede vp Drondale, Abown his hede he gane it hale His Enemy for to dere. He hade almoste wroghte hym bale, A quartere of his helme a-waye gane vale, And halfen-dele his one Ere; Þat þ? Sara?ene by-gane to helde, &amp; vp he caste his noble schelde, In þ? bokells gane he schere. So thikke þaire dynttis to-gedir pelyde, thaire armours hewenn laye in þ? felde, Als floures þat strewede were. 43 Belesent sayde full curtaysly: “Mi lorde, þay feghten full gentilly, &amp; grete trauayle þay hafe.” Vp to god he caste a crye, And to his Moder Saynt Marie: “Fro schame ?e Rowlande Saue; And conuerte vs ?one gentill knyghte Þat es so hardy and so wighte, For elles it were grete wathe. He es so ferse in armes to fyghte And a man of mekill myghte; Full doghety are þay bathe.” 44 Than Rowlande sayde full curtaysly: “Sara?ene, will þou cristenyde be &amp; leue appon oure laye? A noble gifte I schall giffe the, Belesent þat es brighte of ble, In þ? worlde ne es siche a maye. And thow and I and Olyuer, We schall be felawes all in fere, &amp; trauell nyghte &amp; daye: We schall ryde bothe ferre &amp; nere, Wyn Citees &amp; townnes dere, &amp; gode horses at assaye.” 45 the Sara?ene ausuers full stoutly: “thou kan to littill of clergy to leryn me siche a lare. the wordes þat þou hase spoken in hy thou schall þam full dere a-by, With sadde dynttes &amp; sare. I swere the by my grete Mahoun, I schall the lere a newe lessoun, Or I fro the fare, With a bofete appon thi croun Þat þou schall laye þ? wapen doun, rekreyande als þou were.” 46 Þan was sir Rowlande gretly greuded And in his hert full sore ameuede, At þ? Sara?ene lete he flye. He hitt hym a-bown appon þ? heuede, Þat to þ? scholdire þ? swerde wefede, Þ? fyre floghe owte full hye: thurgh duble hawberke it hym schare, to þ? girdilstede it made hym bare, Þen bi-gane he for to plye. Drondale felle so sadde and sare Þat þ? Sara?ene bi-gane to stare, &amp; fallen he was full nye. 47 Þ? Sara?ene þan a lepe he made, A stroke to Rowlande for sothe he glade &amp; hit hym on þ? hede, Þat almoste top ouer tayle he rade, And nere þ? swerde twynede hade, His life þer hade he lefede. And other stroke he to hym bere, And Doun by-fore hym it strypes there, his schelde a waye it reuede And alle þ? skirtys of Rowlandes gere. Otuell says “my suerde kan schere.” &amp; in to þ? erthe it weuede. 48 Rowlande claghte vp his noble schelde, His wapyns wightly for to welde &amp; helde it one his nefe. Þaire dynttis so thikke gan samen helde Þaire harnays hewen was in þ? felde, Full littill was þam leuede, Þaire dynttis felle so sadde &amp; sare, Þat bothe þaire bodies wexen bare, Þaire armours all to-dreues. Þare-fore sir Charlles hade mekill care, appon his knees he knelys thare, &amp; bothe his handes vp-heues, 49 And als þ? kynge thus prayed faste, A dofe come fro the holy gaste, &amp; one þ? Sara?ene lightes: And þan was he full sore agaste, And vn-to sir Rowlande saide he in haste: “Sesse, sir, of thi fighttes, For I ame broghte in siche a will, Þat I ?oure lawes will fulfill, And be-come a Cristyn knyghte.” Þan doun þay layde þaire wapyns still, And aythere wente othire vntill, A Saughtillynge was þer dighte. 50 Þan wolde þ? kynge no lengere dueel Bot hyed hym dowun of the castelle, &amp; grete lordes hym by; He askede sir Rowlande how it bi-felle, and he ansuerde with wordes snelle: “Mi lorde, full gentilly I hafe foghten with þ? beste knyghte, In alle this wdrlde es none so wighte, Þat euer ?itt prouede I . And he hase ?olden hym to the righte, Belesent I hafe hym highte, Gare cristen hym in hy.” 51 Vn-to þ? grounde þan knelide þ? kynge, He loued god of alle this thynge, And his Modir fre. two gude stedis þay garte forthe brynge, &amp; one þay lepe with-owte lettynge &amp; went home to þ? Cite. Bischope Turpyn was Redy With bukes &amp; with Stoles in hy, A fownte sone halowes he To cristen hym þat was doghety; Many grete lorde stode thaym by With myche Solempnyte. 52 And when þ?

Als lely like was hir coloure, Hir rode rede als rose floure, In lere þat rynnes righte. Þ? kyng toke þat brighte in boure With menske &amp; with myche honoure, &amp; gaffe hym þat birde so brighte. 53 He said: “hafe here my doghetir fre, And Rowlande felawe schall þou bee, And gentill sir Olyuer: Powunce and plesaunce I schall gife the, With two full noble Cites, With towrres heghe &amp; dere. I make the lorde of lumbardye, To hafe it alle to thi Bayllyee, Þat contrey ferre &amp; nere. For thi noble cheuallrye Welcome to this companye, Duelle &amp; be a pere.” 54 the Sara?ene knelyde appon his knee, And thankkes the kynge full gentilly Of thies giftes so gude. He sayde: “Damesell, arte þou payed of me?” And sche sayde: “?ee, als mot I thee!” Full frely was þat fude. than he said: “I make a-vowe to mylde Marie, that I hafe now chosen to my lady, Þat es so mylde of mode, that I schall wende to attale, And for thi lufe do cheualrye And distruye þ? heythyn blode. 55 Sir kyng, I giff a-gayne to the this mayden þat es faire &amp; fre, &amp; in clethynge comly clede. And lokes alle þat we redy be In to the landes of lumbardye, Righte als we firste redde, For to distruye there goddes Enemy Þat hathe to ?owe ther grete envy, With folkes on fote wele fedde. When I hafe tane Myn Eme garcy And the Cite of Attaly Þis Mayden schall I wedde.” 56 The [kyng] said þan to his duspers: “Now hafe [?e] herde þ? Messangeres, ?our consell what es beste? Sir Garcy with his stronge powere Distruyes my landes both ferre &amp; nere, Mi Cites brekes &amp; bristes: He confoundes so myche of Cristen blode Þat I for Sorowe goo nere wode, And I may hafe no riste.” And þay þan ansuerde with steryn mode: “to fende of, lorde, vs thynke it gude, to batayle are we priste.” 57 Þ? kynge saide: “we will habyde till it be nerre þ? Somer tyde, Þ? colde of Marche be gone. We schalle sende lettres on ilke a syde, In dyuerse countres brode &amp; wyde, to grete lordes ichone. Sqwyers doghety vndir schelde, that wele kan þaire wapyns welde, by-hynde vs leue we none: And alle þat are with-in elde loke þat þay to batayle helde, Goddes Enemys for to slone.” 58 Þus þ? kynge duellys there till þe tyme commen were, Þ? daye neghede neghe. With hym Rowlande &amp; Olyuere, And þ? gentill Grauntere, In Batayle þat was so sleghe; sir Oggere and sir Raynere, Duke Naymes was þaire fere, &amp; Gayryn of kynredyn heghe: sir Estut and sir Inglere, sir Otuell the werryoure, his dynttys were full dreghe. 59 Appon a Mornynge þay lokede owte And saughe there powere stythe &amp; stowtte comynge ferre &amp; nere.

Awnters thoghte þay for to byde, Þay stale awaye by a wodde syde, Righte towarde Attale, 65 And a Mile with-owtten Attale there houede foure kynges fre With speris in thaire hande. And ichone sware in theire degree Þat þay wolde reghte gladly see Olyuer and Rowlande. Þay sware alle by þaire grete Mahowun, “We wolde þat þay were nowe here bowun, to loke how þay couthe stande. And so we scholde for-Iuste þam doun Þat þay solde neuer see Charllyoun, Þ? chefe of Cristen lande.” 66 Now, lordynges, for to rede ?ow righte thies kynges names what þay highte, Þ? sothe I will ?ow tell. kynge Balsame, a mane of myghte, kynge Corsabell, a-noþer knyghte, Þat bothe was ferse &amp; felle; kyng Askuardyne þat teraunt, Of wikkednes he myghte hym auaunte, Was lyke a fende of helle; the ferthe was faire and auenante With a full Maniy Semblande, Men callede hym kyng Claryell. 67 kynge Clariell sayde: “als mot I the, Rowlande es holden full doghety, Es none siche vndir Sone. Be Mahonn I wolde he were here me by, I scholde assaye his Body, My dynttis scholde he con!” thies knyghttes herde how þay therett were, With spores þay brochede þaire stedis there, oute of þ? wodde þay rynn. than sayd kynge Clariell breme als bare: “We hafe þam þat we spake faire, Be Mahoun alle es wonn. 68 Bot wendes now forthe, ?e kynges three, And slees ?one knyghtis of Cristyantee, &amp; I schall houe here styll. Alle als ?e done I schall see, there es no mache vn-to mee, And þat me lykes ille.” kyng askuardyn in his gere Rydes owte a course of were, Full werly and with ill will. And Rowlande thurgh his scholdir gan schere, his armours ne vaylede noghte a pere, his hert blode he gan þer spill. 69 kyng Corsabolyn in armes full clere Rydis owte to sir Oggere and hittes hym in þ? schelde. the Cristen knyghte neghede hym so nere thurgh double hawberke he hym bere, Of horse he garte hym helde. kyng Balsamy rode till sir Olyuere, thies thre kynges dyede in fere, &amp; lyen gronande in þ? felde.

Charls our kinge in his bed slepithe, gladly brought to bed, and no harm thinkithe; litill rest had the king in his riche clothes, For drechinge and dremyng &amp; trobling his wittis, A sweuyn he met that derid hym sor; that he was hie on his [hors] in wed hore, And saragos the cete seigid about, with all his meyne that he led out. then com gwynylon &amp; gript hym herd, went to his wepon and a sond braid, that the splintis of the sper sprong into heuyn, he went his way with weping steuyn, he left vntak the toun, and to his tent ridis; thoughe he wer wrothe, no man hym wytis. but sone aftur he fell in a noþer: hym thought ferre in fraunce with-outon Frend ther, In A willd Forest Among willd bestis A Bore com from A bank wondirly boistous, And Fought sore with hym, and fendithe hym swithe. he tok hym by the right arm and hent it of clene from the braun, the flesche, &amp; the lier; the fell and the Flesche at his fete fallithe. he lokid ouer a lawnd, the sothe for to sayn, he se a libard lep from low spayn; ther he tok the bore And laid hym to erthe, redely the right ere he pullid from the hed, he lep lightly away, he wold no lenger dwell. then awok the king, &amp; his dreme did tell. when It was day, and the dew fell, then rose the kinge; he wold no mor dwell: he callid the wissest men þen aright, and askid of his dreme hou it be myght. all they said, þat þer did stond, that tray and tene is toward at hond, battell on the feld, byd who þat myght: but none of hem knew þe trouthe aright, whan It will fall the feld for to wyn, and the lebard had tak the bore &amp; slayn hym. and for fair the flesche &amp; þe fight endid, then shuld kinge charls the better aspendid. sithe the bore was beten &amp; basched no mor, but the hurt that he had, hele shuld thor, throughe right resson, they said hym till: “now let god alone, and do all his will.” “lordis,” said the king, “listyn a stound. now we must to Fraunce, god send vs sound! her be wais wild that we wend most, full hore hillis and also he on bost; Full of cragy roches they bene sertayn, And they be callid the gatis of spayn: ther may not iij men go in at onys, luk whiche baron can led vs eft sonnys, whiche knyght our rerward shall gid. for I am not secur of the sairsins þis tid, they be so full of the fend, I drede þer werkis; they must be Frowardis þat delithe with euyll frekis, or he shall haue euyll sped at the last end.” then gwynylon spek—the deuyll hym shend!— “lordis, listyn to me A litill stound. do, lord, as I red, if þou wilt pase sound.

I will hold me by-hind, and þ? men led; rid with the rerward, and be ther gid. but be that lord god þat me hathe bought, ther is noþer kinge ne knyght in my thought that me defithe, I shall his dethe wirche, And clef hym with my brond doun to his tethe. ther-for It is best I busk me blif, when your luen is furthe, I will beleue.” the kinge praid his princis euerychon, If eny man a litill behind gone with a bold battell, the best þat he had, till the folk wer gone þat wer sad. and they said “nay, none oþer wold.” then wer they a-dred lest þey dye shold: Gwynylon was fals long or þat tym, for men dred tresson wher they it finden, and thought on tresson þer trist was neuer. the kinge then was wrothe with þat answer; he lokid about on his bold barons: “Sostir son,” he said, “forsak thou þis sondis: I must bid on my horse, behouythe me non oþer. mak me a batelle for barons &amp; oþer that wille abid in the feld for wers or better. let your harnes go be-for, &amp; hie you aftur, and we will cum aftir when we list. sistir son,” said the king, “sore I mystrist; let we now leue till we eft met; ther is no game ne gle in my hert yet. halfondell of my men I the be-teche, For to help the, þat no harm the reche.” “nay,” said Roulond, “so will I nought; why shuld so many be with me sought? but of my peres, both princis &amp; dukis, let them bid with me in euery shouris. whilles me lastithe lyf, ne shall ye lese man, kny?t in my keping, ne knawe þat we han; horse ne harnes, the hethyn shall not wyn whillis I may endur, by eny maner gyn, and dintis to dele with good durmidalle.” And, whils this tale was told in the sale, vnto Roulond then went the princis xij; Olyuer, and Roger, And Aubry hym-selue, Richard, and Rayner, that redy was euer, tirry, And turpyn, all redy wer, And the good giliuer, that good was at ned, Nemes and oþer iiij, þat god be þer sped! all they said atonys they will to-gedur hold, with Sir Roulond to rid they wer bold: “For he in word and werk greuyd vs neuer, nor sparid schewing of sheldis for non þat lyuyd euer: For dred of dethe, he hid neuer his hed, with hym is worship euer-mor in ded, ther men may wyn worship for euer.” Ingeler And Oger stod vp ther, Archbold and arnold þat gret wer holdene, Gauter and Gaisser &amp; godfray the bolleyn, barenger, and berard, &amp; bedwar the strang, the riche man Richard þat russelen fonge, sampson of seymer said to charls, For to weld all the welth þat men myght, they wold no furþer go then full right, and leue lordis behind þat they louyd euer: they will hold with them “till our hertis bled, ther hedis throughe helmes hewen in-ded, Our well and worship to win sound. yet will tutlers in toun talk bound, that we wer the men þat Roulond wold quell. good Sir, haue good day, to god we þe be-teche! For we will rid in the rout, Roulond to seche.” “I be-tak you to crist,” said the kinge then, “þat died on the rood, he sped you euyn!” now is roulond redy with his rout faire, For to abid at a bank with barons thar. the kinge ridithe on,—crist be his sped!— and all his lordis riding by his sid, and warnyd them hou they do shold; he bad no bern be so bold vpon mold, bugle to blow, ne beme to soun, but he the sairsins se all redy boune, “And he the hethyn se, and help wold haue, lowd cast vp a cry, and hie vs hym to saue:” and they grauntid so for to do. the kinge lep on his sted, stint wold he nought, And euery man on horsbak homward sought; Gwynylon rod be-for, and tho men bad redely to rid, and all the rout sad with soft songis and nothing glad. our men þat behind wer, oder play had: he must tak hed þat with euyll delithe, they wer dampnyd to dethe, as the bok seithe. A mor sorowfull day had they neuer: Itt is wretyn in storis to remembre euer. Here ridithe Roulond, god be his gid! of our cristyn let vs ouer slid, And spek of the hethyn, as the story sais, that hathe spied the werkis of king charls, hou he ridithe furthe, &amp; his men leuys, that he wold fanest haue þer he leseis. then spek the soudan &amp; bad his men hye, “busk you to horse right hastely; tak ye no trewes, thoughe ye myght, for gift ne garison as gwynylon hight. blisssid be mahoun! myche he vs helpithe, to-day we shall haue our will right as vs likithe.” then com þer a kinge with knyghtis many,— he was of the soudan kyn with-outon nay; Amaris he hight, þat many a toun ought; prince was of portingall, proud eft in thought;— Vnto the soudan he said his wille: “lord,” he said, “to you will I tell, that I may go be-for with my noun men, I will say one thinge þat ye shall kene. may I met with Roulond in eny stond, I shall bet hys men and hew hym to ground.” then said the soudon, “mahoun the blis, And help the ther-to, þat thou not myse!” he lep vpon his sted &amp; furthe did he ryd, with xl. thoussond sairsins by his sid; ouer hillis and holtis he hastid full sone, vnto the tym to the cristyn þey com. still then he stod, and set his knyghtis, and thought he had had to few to hold fightis. Roulond was war of þer euyll dedis; he comandid barons by his sidis; he armyd hym surly in Irne wed, And thought hym sure for eny ned. his baners beten with gold for the nonys, set with diamondis &amp; oþer stonys; his kneys coueryd with platis many, his thies thryngid with silk, as I say his Acton And oþer ger þat he werid, the swerd was full good þat he þer had, the hilt then he takithe surly And sad, when that his helme on his hed wer, And his glovis gletering with gold wir; durimdall his swerd gird hym about, with a schynyng sheld on his shulder stout: he tok with hym his sper, and went to his horse, but lep on lightly with-out any fors. then euery cristyn knyght vnto oþer said: “It is fair, Roulond to folow in a braid; he may boldly abid, þat hathe siche a lord.” “now wise vs crist!” quod Roulond, “one word; we be fellos and frendis, god be our gid; we be stad in a place a stound to abid, Amonge medos, and moris, &amp; euyll bankis, And roches roughe, and wodis full of bestis, beter for birdis to bred, þen men in to won, or wild wollves for to walk in sone. It is good to be wise in ded and in thought. If Gwynylon tressour haue tak, &amp; treson wrought, And to the soudan sold vs, as It semyd best, he may the haue vs euyn as they lest, And we vn-warnyd þer-of in this tid. but go furthe, sir gauter, god be your gid, and x M tak of our men; go down by yonder clif and luk þen, If eny hethyn be þer to wirche vs wo; and we will cum to you asson as we may, for to go þat way: and euery man kep oþer, And we may son help yf we þink myster.” now is gauter dight as Roulond hym bad; And his sheld and his brond he had: he shakis down by a schaw and his men right, And lukid on euery sid and se no wight: he rod furthe in an holt, by an hore bank, he se in the vale wher an ost stant, With bright sheldis and schaftis in hond. then wer they wild in þer werkis to found, to Fight or to fall they wist non oþer. Amaris bad hys men sped hem thedir: “go ye forthe proudly, &amp; ber you bold.” A wondur sore mettinge men myght be-hold, what man It had sene mervell to tell; hou wondirly on they set with dintis felle; speris to-brast and in pecis flowen, swerdis swedyrd out &amp; laid hem doun; the blod out at brestis, the brayn at the hedys, lymmys went A-sundir and lost ther stedis. the cristyn wer be-set and coueryd nought. many sairsins that tid to the erthe sought or our folk wer feld, and the feld endid. that day sir gauter many on woundid, till his hed was hurt, &amp; hir brest brok that he se on no sid socour ne help: but the hethyn euer hew hym vpon. then he smot his sted on the hill son, many on folowed, yet it vailid nought; he ridithe weping away And his feles sought. but cristis willis ne wer in þat ilkey stond, that euer he shuld suffur so many a wound. And It wer not to warn his felos all, he had leuer to dy then so shuld be-fall; he rod vp by a bank bleding full sore, And se Roulond rid, a Rout hym be-for, and old Roger behynd þat yet fled neuer: then he kest vp a cry, and callithe hem euer: “crist the red, roulond, &amp; þ? rout son, for I haue lost þat I had, but my-selue a-lone. as I went with-out folkis valis to seche, we wer be-set about: þe deuyll hem feche! they haue slayn my fellos full bold; that I wer on them vengid, god it wold! but now I know hou þat It wendis, I wold foulis had ete me, so I wer at my end. gwynylon hathe vs gilid, I may say now; that euer he was born, a tratur to prove!” ther was weping and wailling of knyghtis, mornynge and menyng of all oþer wightis. thoughe Roulond rew þat rese, he red rem all: “lordis, leue this sorow; help it ne shall. thoughe we dye for sorow, It valithe nought; And in heuyn be þer soulis with-outon thought! let vs spek, and sped our tyme, let our hertis be hie, and to-gedir rynn, that no hethyn hound of our men wyn, but he by it with blod, his brest with-in. For men will tell charls this full sone, when we haue slayn the fals, &amp; the feld won.” now of thes lordis rest we a whill, And spek we of king charlis þens many A mylle. “hou may this chaunce be,” said charls the strong, “that my good knyghtis abiden so long? now may I dred þat I dremyd this nyght, hou A bore bet me and my brond bright, And my spere spild, and my sped failid. I tok it to Roulond &amp; he hem sailid, then is my lyf lorn for euer, &amp; or it dawen the day, his shuld for euer, I wold þat I wer doluyn in clay.” and all the barons to hym gan say: “lord, we will wit what shall be-tid. If gwynylon haue done tresson wild he hathe vs all sold, who so tell durst; but ye ar betraid, we nedis say must, ye trist no trew men þat tellis you right; whoo tellis you sothe, gothe out of sight. he hathe found way to fell vs to ground, and hathe brewid bale in this ilkay stound; and that may sore rew many of your knyghtis.” then was gwynylon wrothe anon rightis, he kest vp his browes &amp; blenchid his eye; he com be-for the kyng &amp; his kyn many, markis and melon and milo þe proud, herdref the hardy in his wed good, And xv mo of that fals kind. gwynylon kest his gloue be-for hem all: “saueng you, my lord, non spar I shall; he that saithe I am tretour, And tok of þe hethyn horse, or harnes, or eny other thing, broche, or bessant, eny harm to done; I will fight with hym, &amp; preue hym fals sone. shall neuer hors bere me of þis place, till I be on hym vengid þat þus said has.” thus said he to the king stonding hym be sid: “he that wold work well, wrothe hym be-tid. vpon almyghty god I put this full right, that I to the soudan nothing be-hight, but for to say the sothe in this ilk stound, your knyghtis be-hind haue som bores fond, or Among the holtis I-herd ryll som hertis; then will Roulond rid among the cleves; he will fell of the Fattest, &amp; you flesche bring; ye know þat he louythe well hunting. he will do his will thouhe it to harm turn. For this thinge ye ned no thing to morn, For harme of hethen ne dred you neuer.” the kinge did stint his strif þen for euer, and gothe with his men throughe the toun, and made accordment betwen hem boun. many a sore sighe went to his hert. the kinge is to Cardoile with care &amp; smert; of hym no mor I tell, but turn to his kny?tis, hou they rod to-gedur in counsall righte. som bad Roulond to blow aftur socour, And som bad hym bid of his blast lengour, and be redy to fight, for fle they nylle. off the hethen houndis herkyn me till, hou they wickidly wrought then be-dene; many a wilfull word went hem betwene. the soudan hathe semblid his men all, And they be redy, what so euer be-fall, men myght se ther ostis in the feldis þer: xx batelles araid all in bright gere, with sheld and sper schynyng bright; and xx crounyd kingis among hem right, eueryche of them rechar then other, the soudan folowed one after anoþer. the sory mad mahoun that they most louyd, to hym all lowtyd, and he on hight hovid, and praid hym that he hem wische wold. they splayd baners, for men se it shold. the feld shone bright, that men myght behold, It was wonder of the soudan so bold. It was in euery manys ere, &amp; not to seche. thus rid they furthe: to the deuyll I hem teche! myche harm was done by the dais end. with that, Amarys met with the soudan hend, with his gret rout riding out of toun; then he stintid his sted &amp; stod still sone, and gret hym merely with good will. “lord mahoun saue the, and kep the from euyll, that thou lese no man ne lond þer thou wendis! Mahoun the saue and the deffendis, but I haue feller then I be-for had. som I met of ther men, they be not mad, x Ml; by taile ther lyues did sell: of them escapid but on, as I you tell, and wondid he was, I tell you sothe. þer-for he ys bold, and to batele gothe.

And he tok of the best that bene bold: Causaryne, that was fals, formest of all, Corsabran, the curssid, kenyst in halle, the bold barbaryn is set on his sted, lionys and lauris, gret kingis inded, keston of calern, and cokard his broder, Tauberd and tampryn, sonyst off oþer: they say to the sovdan in the sam stevyn: “now we be redy to rid furthe euyn, to go in-to the forward to rest vs awhile: For duk Roulond he is fell, but euery pece of his harnes be Asonder rent, And he feld on the feld, and also schent; as longe as thou leuyst, trist vs neuer If we in this mater do not our deuour.” It botes not to abid: full sone the soudan tok his leue anon. An C thoussand of good men wer dressid in ther harnes then, with proud synes of silk lifte on loft. Amaris be-for hem myghtily sought, cryethe vpon mauhoun with mody steuyn:— curse hym, crist, that sittis in heuyn!— bemes and bugles blew full many, that all the daile and doun dynnyd truly. And help Roulondes ost, he þat heuyn weldis! a dredfull tym haue they vnder ther sheldis. Olyuer of that host out from his frendis Is redyn to a roche A litill ther hendis: he saw to Saragos the sairsins all,— A curssed forward, and fight they shall:— he turnyd his sted, and taried no lenger, for to tell his felos to be the strenger; to Roulond and Richard, &amp; Rayner his broder, Ingler and Aubry, and ek all þe oþer: “lordingis, mak you redy, And well on set; the hole hethyn host hastithe you to met; not fully iiij furlong is you betwen; þer-for luk lightly what is best to done, to Abid boldly, or els for to turn; the gile of gwynylon will mak vs to morn but crist vs send socour betym. but wer It thy will, Roulond, then, thy bugle to blow on this bent sid that king charls myght her it this tid; that we be sore be-set, son will he know; we may fight with yonder host, as I trow, till he be couerd and com to this bank; And our men wer here, god wold I thank thoughe ther wer siche ten, I tell you be-dene.” “abid,” quod Roulond, “and siche wordis blyn!

If we dye here, his baile is the mor: I tell my lyf-tym then is for-lore. he may walk homward with hert rew, loue his bed well ouer course, shall he neuer frenchmen out of frauns led.” then was this man wrothe in-ded, And to them said he ther: “ye knyghtis, for shame shon ye neuer. haue ye broken eny bone, or eny harm tid? may ye schew in your sheld eny strokis wid?
