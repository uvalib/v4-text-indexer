      <field name="fulltext">TO THE TRVLIE Learned, and my worthy Friende, Ma. Mathew Royden. Richard Stapleton to the Author. Phœbus hath giuen thee both his bow, and Muse; With one thou slayst the Artizans of thunder, And to thy loose dost such a sounde infuse, That gatherd storms therewith are blowne in sunder: The other decks her with her golden wings Spred beyond measure, in thy ample verse, Where she (as in her bowrs of Lawrell) sings Sweet philosophick strains that Feends might pierse, The soule of brightnes in thy darknes shines Most new, and deare: vnstainde with forraine graces, And when aspiring sprights shall reach thy lines, They will not heare our trebble-termed bases. With boldnes then thy able Poems vse Phœbus hath giuen thee both his bow and Muse. Tho: VVilliams of the inner Temple. Issue of Semele that will imbrace With fleshly arms the three-wingd wife of thunder: Let her sad ruine, such proud thoughts abase And view aloofe, this verse in silent wonder, If neerer your vnhallowed eyes wil pierse, Then (with the Satyre) kisse this sacred fire, To scorch your lips, that dearely taught thereby Your onely soules fit obiects may aspire, But you high spirrits in thys cloud of gold Inioy like Joue) this bright Saturnian Muse, Your eyes can well the dazeling beames behold This Pythian lightner freshly doth effuse To dant the basenes of that bastard traine Whose twise borne iudgments, formeles still remaine. Another. [Vngratefull Farmers of the Muses land] Vngratefull Farmers of the Muses land That (wanting thrift and iudgment to imploy it) Let it manureles and vnfenced stand, Till barbarous Cattell enter and destroy it: Now the true heyre is happily found out Who (framing it t'inritch posterities) Walles it with spright-fild darknes round about, Grafs, plants, and sowes; and makes it Paradise. To which without the Parcæs golden bow, None can aspire but stick in errors hell; A Garland to engird a Monarchs brow, Then take some paines to ioy so rich a Iewell Most prize is graspt in labors hardest hand, And idle soules can nothing rich command. I. D. of the middle Temple. Onely that eye which for true loue doth weepe, Onely that hart which tender loue doth pierse, May read and vnderstand this sacred vierse For other wits too misticall and deepe: Betweene these hallowed leaues Cupid dooth keepe The golden lesson of his second Artist, For loue, till now, hath still a Maister mist Since Ouids eyes were closd with iron sleepe; But now his waking soule in Chapman liues, Which showes so well the passions of his soule, And yet this Muse more cause of wonder giues, And doth more Prophet-like loues art enroule: For Ouids soule, now growne more old and wise, Poures foorth it selfe in deeper misteries. Another. [Since Ouid (loues first gentle Maister) dyed] Since Ouid (loues first gentle Maister) dyed he hath a most notorious trueant beene, And hath not once in thrice fiue ages seene That same sweete Muse that was his first sweet guide; But since Apollo who was gratified Once with a kisse, hunting on Cynthus greene, By loues fayre Mother tender Beauties Queene, This fauor vnto her hath not enuied, That into whome she will, she may infuse For the instruction of her tender sonne, The gentle Ouids easie supple Muse, Which vnto thee (sweet Chapman) she hath doone: Shee makes (in thee) the spirit of Ouid moue, And calles thee second Maister of her loue Futurum inuisibile. Ouids Banquet of SENCE. The Argument. Ovid, newly enamoured of Iulia, (daughter to Octauius Augustus Cæsar, after by him called Corynna,) secretly conuaid himselfe into a Garden of the Emperors Court: in an Arbor whereof, Corynna was bathing; playing vpon her Lute, and singing: which Ouid ouer-hearing, was exceedingly pleasde with the sweetnes of her voyce, &amp; to himselfe Auditus. vttered the comfort he conceiued in his sence of Hearing. Then the odors shee vsde in her bath, breathing a rich sauor, Olfactus. hee expresseth the ioy he felt in his sence of Smelling. Thus growing more deeplie enamoured in great contentation with himselfe, he venters to see her in the pride of her nakednesse: which dooing by stealth, he discouered the comfort hee conceiued in Seeing, and the glorie of her beautie. Visus. Not yet satisfied, hee vseth all his Art to make knowne his being there, without her offence: or (being necessarily offended) Gustus. to appease her: which done, he entreats a kisse to serue for satisfaction of his Tast, which he obtaines. Then proceedes he to entreaty for the fift sence and there is Tactus. interrupted. NARRATIO. The Earth, from heauenly light conceiued heat, Which mixed all her moyst parts with her dry, When with right beames the Sun her bosome beat, And with fit foode her Plants did nutrifie; They (which to Earth, as to theyr Mother cling In forked rootes) now sprinckled plenteously With her warme breath; did hasten to the spring, Gather their proper forces, and extrude All powre but that, with which they stood indude. Then did Cyrrhus is a surname of the Sun, fr? a towne called Cyrrha, where he was honored. Cyrrhus fill his eyes with fire, Whose ardor curld the foreheads of the trees, And made his greene-loue burne in his desire, When youth, and ease, (Collectors of loues fees) Entic'd Corynna to a siluer spring, Enchasing a round Bowre; which with it sees, By Prosopopæia, he makes y? fountaine y? eye of the round Arbor, as a Diamant seemes to be the eye of a Ring: and therefore sayes, the Arbor sees with the Fountaine. (As with a Diamant dooth an ameld Ring) Into which eye, most pittifully stood Niobe, shedding teares, that were her blood. Stone Niobe, whose statue to this Fountaine, In great Augustus Cæsars grace was brought From Sypilus, the steepe Mygdonian Mountaine: That statue tis, still weepes for former thought, Into thys spring Corynnas bathing place; So cunningly to optick reason wrought, That afarre of, it shewd a womans face, Heauie, and weeping; but more neerely viewed, Nor weeping, heauy, nor a woman shewed. In Sommer onely wrought her exstasie; And that her story might be still obserued, Octauius caus'd in curious imagrie, Her fourteene children should at large be carued, Theyr fourteene brests, with fourteene arrowes gored And set by her, that for her seede so starued To a stone Sepulcher herselfe deplored, In Iuory were they cut, and on each brest, In golden Elements theyr names imprest. Her sonnes, were Sypilus, Agenor, Phædimus, ismenus, Argus, and Damasiothen, The seauenth calde like his Grandsire, Tantalus. Her Daughters, were the fayre Astiochen, Chloris, Næera, and Pelopie, Phaeta, proud Phthia, and Eugigen, All these apposde to violent Niobe Had lookes so deadly sad, so liuely doone, As if Death liu'd in theyr confusion. Behind theyr Mother two Pyramides Of freckled Marble, through the Arbor viewed, On whose sharp brows, Sol, and Tytanides In purple and transparent glasse were hewed, Through which the Sun-beames on the statues staying, Made theyr pale bosoms seeme with blood imbrewed, Those two sterne Plannets rigors still bewraying To these dead forms, came liuing beauties essence Able to make them startle with her presence. In a loose robe of Tynsell foorth she came, Nothing but it betwixt her nakednes And enuious light. The downward-burning flame, Of her rich hayre did threaten new accesse, Of ventrous Phaeton to scorch the fields: And thus to bathing came our Poets Goddesse, Her handmaides bearing all things pleasure yeelds To such a seruice; Odors most delighted, And purest linnen which her lookes had whited. Then cast she off her robe, and stood vpright, As lightning breakes out of a laboring cloude; Or as the Morning heauen casts off the Night, Or as that heauen cast off it selfe, and showde Heauens vpper light, to which the brightest day Is but a black and melancholy shroude: Or as when Uenus striu'd for soueraine sway Of charmfull beautie, in yong Troyes desire, So stood Corynna vanishing her tire. A soft enflowred banck embrac'd the founte; Of Chloris ensignes, an abstracted field; Where grew Melanthy, great in Bees account, Amareus, that precious Balme dooth yeeld, Enameld Pansies, vs'd at Nuptials still, Dianas arrow, Cupids crimson shielde, Ope-morne, night-shade, and Venus nauill, Solemne Violets, hanging head as shamed, And verdant Calaminth, for odor famed. Sacred Nepenthe, purgatiue of care, And soueraine Rumex that doth rancor kill, Sya, and Hyacinth, that Furies weare, White and red Iessamines, Merry, Melliphill: Fayre Crowne-imperiall, Emperor of Flowers, Immortall Amaranth, white Aphrodill, And cup-like Twillpants, stroude in Bacchus Bowres, These cling about this Natures naked Iem, To taste her sweetes, as Bees doe swarme on them. And now shee vsde the Founte, where Niobe, Toomb'd in her selfe, pourde her lost soule in teares, Vpon the bosome of this Romaine Phœbe; Who; bathd and Odord; her bright lyms she rears, And drying her on that disparent rounde; Her Lute she takes t'enamoure heauenly eares, And try if with her voyces vitall sounde, She could warme life through those colde statues spread, And cheere the Dame that wept when she was dead. And thus she sung, all naked as she sat, Laying the happy Lute vpon her thigh, Not thinking any neere to wonder at The blisse of her sweete brests diuinitie, The Song of Corynna. T'is better to contemne then loue, And to be fayre then wise; For soules are rulde by eyes: And Ioues Bird, ceaz'd by Cypris Doue, It is our grace and sport to see, Our beauties sorcerie, That makes (like destinie) Men followe vs the more wee flee; That sets wise Glosses on the foole, And turns her checkes to bookes, Where wisdome sees in lookes Derision, laughing at his schoole, Who (louing) proues, prophanenes, holy; Nature, our fate, our wisdome, folly. While this was singing, Ouid yong in loue With her perfections, neuer prouing yet How mercifull a Mistres she would proue, Boldly embrac'd the power he could not let And like a fiery exhalation Followd the sun, he wisht might neuer set; Trusting heerein his constellation Rul'd by loues beames, which Iulias eyes erected, Whose beauty was the star his life directed. And hauing drencht his anckles in those seas, He needes woulde swimme, and car'd not if he drounde: Loues feete are in his eyes; for if he please The depth of beauties gulfye floodd to sounde, He goes vpon his eyes, and vp to them, At the first steap he is; no shader grounde Coulde Ouid finde; but in loues holy streame Was past his eyes, and now did wett his eares, For his high Soueraignes siluer voice he heares. Whereat his wit, assumed fierye wings, Soring aboue the temper of his soule, And he the purifying rapture sings Of his eares sence, takes full the Thespian boule And it carrouseth to his Mistres health, Whose sprightfull verdure did dull flesh controle, And his conceipt he crowneth with the wealth Of all the Muses in his pleased sences, When with the eares delight he thus commences: Now Muses come, repayre your broken wings, (Pluckt, and prophan'd by rusticke Ignorance,) With feathers of these notes my Mistres sings; And let quick verse hir drooping head aduance From dungeons of contempt to smite the starrs; In Iulias tunes, led forth by furious trance A thousand Muses come to bid you warrs, Diue to your Spring, and hide you from the stroke, All Poets furies will her tunes inuoke. Neuer was any sence so sette on fire With an immortall ardor, as myne eares; Her fingers to the strings doth speeche inspire And numberd laughter; that the deskant beares To hir sweete voice; whose species through my sence My spirits to theyr highest function reares; To which imprest with ceaseles confluence It vseth them, as propper to her powre Marries my soule, and makes it selfe her dowre; Me thinks her tunes flye guilt, like Attick Bees To my eares hiues, with hony tryed to ayre; My braine is but the combe, the wax, the lees, My soule the Drone, that liues by their affayre. O so it sweets, refines, and rauisheth, And with what sport they sting in theyr repayre? Rise then in swarms, and sting me thus to death Or turne me into swounde; possesse me whole, Soule to my life, and essence to my soule. Say gentle Ayre, ô does it not thee good Thus to be smit with her correcting voyce? Why daunce ye not, ye daughters of the wood? Wither for euer, if not now reioyce. Rise stones, and build a Cittie with her notes, And notes infuse with your most Cynthian noyse, To all the Trees, sweete flowers, and christall Flotes, That crowne, and make this cheerefull Garden quick, Vertue, that euery tuch may make such Musick. O that as man is cald a little world The world might shrink into a little man, To heare the notes about this Garden hurld, That skill disperst in tunes so Orphean Might not be lost in smiting stocks and trees That haue no eares; but growne as it began Spred theyr renownes, as far as Phœbus sees Through earths dull vaines; that shee like heauen might moue, In ceaseles Musick, and be fill'd with loue. In precious incense of her holy breath, My loue doth offer Hecatombs of notes To all the Gods; who now despise the death Of Oxen, Heifers, Wethers, Swine, and Goates. A Sonnet in her breathing sacrifiz'd, Delights them more then all beasts bellowing throates, As much with heauen, as with my hearing priz'd. And as guilt Atoms in the sunne appeare, So greete these sounds the grissells of myne eare. Whose pores doe open wide to theyr regreete, And my implanted ayre, that ayre embraceth Which they impresse; I feele theyr nimble feete Tread my eares Labyrinth; theyr sport amazeth They keepe such measure; play themselues and dance. And now my soule in Cupids Furnace blazeth, Wrought into furie with theyr daliance: And as the fire the parched stuble burns, So fades my flesh, and into spyrit turns. Sweete tunes, braue issue, that from Iulia come; Shooke from her braine, armd like the Queene of Ire; For first In this allusion to the birth of Pallas; he shewes the conceit of her Sonnet; both for matter and note, and by Metaphor hee expresseth how shee deliuered her words, &amp; tunes, which was by commision of the order, Philosophers set downe in apprehension of our knoweledge, and effection of our sences, for first they affirme, the species of euery obiect propagates it selfe by our spirites to our common sence, that, deliuers it to the imaginatiue part, that to the Cogitatiue: the Cogitatiue to the Passiue Intelect. the Passiue Intelect, to that which is called Dianoia, or Discursus; and that deliuers it vp to the minde, which order hee obserues in her vtterance. conceiued in her mentall wombe, And nourisht with her soules discursiue fire, They grew into the power of her thought; She gaue them dounye plumes from her attire, And them to strong imagination brought: That, to her voice; wherein most mouinglye Shee (blessing them with kysses) letts them flye. Who flye reioysing; but (like noblest mindes) In giuing others life themselues do dye, Not able to endure earthes rude vnkindes Bred in my soueraigns parts too tenderly; O that as The Philosopher saith, Intellectus in ipsa intellegibilia transit, vpon which is grounded thys inuention, that in the same manner his life might passe into hys Mistres conceite, intending his intellectuall life, or soule: which by this Analogie, should bee Intellectus, &amp; her c?ceit, Intelligibilis. Intellects themselues transite To eache intellegible quallitie, My life might passe into my loues conceit, Thus to be form'd in words, her tunes, and breath, And with her kysses, sing it selfe to death. This life were wholy sweete, this onely blisse, Thus would I liue to dye; Thus sence were feasted, My life that in my flesh a Chaos is Should to a Golden worlde be thus dygested; Thus should I rule her faces Monarchy, Whose lookes in seuerall Empires are inuested Crown'd now with smiles, and then with modesty, Thus in her tunes diuision I should raigne, For her conceipt does all, in euery vaine. My life then turn'd to that, t'each note, and word Should I consorte her looke; which sweeter sings, Where songs of solid harmony accord, Rulde with Loues rule; and prickt with all his stings; Thus should I be her notes, before This hath reference to the order of her vtterance, exprest before. they be; While in her blood they sitte with fierye wings Not vapord in her voyces stillerie, Nought are these notes her breast so sweetely frames, But motions, fled out of her spirits flames. For as when steele and flint together smit, With violent action spitt forth sparkes of fire, And make the tender tynder burne with it; So my loues soule doth lighten her desire Vppon her spyrits in her notes So is thys lykewise referd to the order aboue said, for the more perspicuitie. pretence; And they conuaye them (for distinckt attire) To vse the Wardrobe of the common sence: From whence in vailes of her rich breath they flye, And feast the eare with this felicitye. Me thinks they rayse me from the heauy ground And moue me swimming in the yeelding ayre: As Zephirs flowry blasts doe tosse a sounde; Vpon their wings will I to Heauen repayre, And sing them so, Gods shall descend and heare Ladies must bee ador'd that are but fayre, But apt besides with art to tempt the eare In notes of Nature, is a Goddesse part, Though oft, mens natures notes, please more then Art. But heere are Art and Nature both confinde, Art casting Nature in so deepe a trance That both seeme deade, because they be diuinde, Buried is Heauen in earthly ignorance, Why breake not men then strumpet Follies bounds, To learne at this pure virgine vtterance? No; none but Ouids eares can sound these sounds, Where sing the harts of Loue and Poesie, Which make my Muse so strong she works too hye. Now in his glowing eares her tunes did sleepe, And as a siluer Bell, with violent blowe Of Steele or Iron, when his soundes most deepe, Doe from his sides and ayres soft bosome flowe, A great while after murmures at the stroke, Letting the hearers eares his hardnes knowe, So chid the Ayre to be no longer broke: And left the accents panting in his eare Which in this Banquet his first seruice were. Heerewith, as Ouid something neerer drew, Olfactus. Her Odors, odord with her breath and brest, Into the sensor of his sauor flew, As if the Phenix hasting to her rest Had gatherd all th' Arabian Spicerie T'enbalme her body in her Tombe, her nest, And there lay burning gainst Apollos eye, Whose fiery ayre straight piercing Ouids braine Enflamde his Muse with a more odorouse vaine. And thus he sung, come soueraigne Odors, come Restore my spirits now in loue consuming, Wax hotter ayre, make them more sauorsome, My fainting life with fresh-breath'd soule perfuming, The flames of my disease are violent, And many perish on late helps presuming, With which hard fate must I yet stand content, As Odors put in fire most richly smell, So men must burne in loue that will excell. And as the ayre is rarefied with heate But thick and grosse with Summer-killing colde, So men in loue aspire perfections seate, When others, slaues to base desire are sold, And if that men neere Ganges liu'd by sent Of Flowres, and Trees, more I a thousand fold May liue by these pure fumes that doe present My Mistres quickning, and consuming breath Where her wish flyes with power of life and death. Me thinks, as in these liberall fumes I burne My Mistres lips be neere with kisse-entices, And that which way soeuer I can turne, She turns withall, and breaths on me her spices As if too pure for search of humaine eye She flewe in ayre disburthening Indian prizes, And made each earthly fume to sacrifice. With her choyse breath fell Cupid blowes his fire, And after, burns himselfe in her desire. Gentle, and noble are theyr tempers framde, That can be quickned with perfumes and sounds, And they are cripple-minded, Gowt-wit lamde, That lye like fire-fit blocks, dead without wounds, Stird vp with nought, but hell-descending gaine, The soule of fooles that all theyr soules confounds, The art of Pessants and our Nobles staine, The bane of vertue and the blisse of sinne. Which none but fooles and Pessants glorie in. Sweete sounds and Odors, are the heauens, on earth Where vertues liue, of vertuous men deceast, Which in such like, receiue theyr second birth By smell and By this allusion drawne from the effects of sounds and Odors, hee imitates the eternitie of Vertue: saying, the vertues of good me liue in them, because they stir vp pure enclinations to the like, as if infusde in perfumes &amp; sounds: Besides, he infers, that such as are neyther delighted with sounds (int?ding by sounds all vtterance of knowledge, as well as musicall affections,) nor with Odors, (W? properly drye the braine &amp; delight the instruments of the soule, making them the more capable of her faculties) such saith hee, perrish without memorie. hearing endlesly encreast; They were meere flesh were not with them delighted, And euery such is perisht like a beast As all they shall that are so foggye sprighted, Odors feede loue, and loue cleare heauen discouers, Louers weare sweets then; sweetest mindes, be louers. Odor in heate and drynes is consite Loue then a fire is much thereto affected; And as ill smells do kill his appetite With thankfull sauors it is still protected; Loue liues in spyrits, and our spyrits be Nourisht with Odors, therefore loue refected; And ayre lesse corpulent in quallitie Then Odors are, doth nourish vitall spyrits Therefore may they be prou'd of equall merits; Of soueraigne Odors; not of force to giue Foode to a thing that liues nor let it dye, But to ad life to that did neuer liue; Nor to ad life, but immortallitie. Since they pertake her heate that like the fire Stolne from the wheeles of Phœbus waggonrie To lumps of earth, can manly lyfe inspire; Else be these fumes the liues of sweetest dames That (dead) attend on her for nouell frames; Reioyce blest Clime, thy ayre is so refinde That while shee liues no hungry pestilence Can feede her poysoned stomack with thy kynde; But as the Vnicorns pregredience To venomd Pooles, doth purdge them with his horne, And after him the desarts Residence May safely drinke, so in the holesome morne After her walke, who there attends her eye, Is sure that day to tast no maladye. Thus was his course of Odors sweet and sleight, Because he long'd to giue his sight assaye, And as in feruor of the summers height, The sunne is so ambitious in his sway He will not let the Night an howre be plast, So in this Cupids Night (oft seene in day Now spred with tender clouds these Odors cast,) Her sight, his sunne so wrought in his desires, His sauor vanisht in his visuale fires. So vulture loue on his encreasing liuer, And fruitfull entrails egerly did feede, And with the goldnest Arrow in his Quiuer, Wounds him with longings, that like Torrents bleeds, To see the Myne of knowledge that enricht His minde with pouertie, and desperate neede A sight that with the thought of sight bewitcht, A sight taught Magick his deepe misterie, Quicker in danger then Allusion to the transformati? of Acteon with the sight of Diana. Dianas eye. Stay therefore Ouid, venter not, a sight May proue thy rudenes, more then shew thee louing, And make thy Mistres thinke thou think'st her light: Which thought with lightest Dames is nothing mouing. The slender hope of fauor thou hast yet Should make thee feare, such grosse conclusions prouing: Besides, the Thicket Floras hands hath set To hide thy theft, is thinne and hollow harted, Not meete to haue so high a charge imparted. And should it keepe thy secrets, thine owne eye Would fill thy thoughts so full of lightenings, That thou must passe through more extremitie. Or stand content to burne beneath theyr wings, Her honor gainst thy loue, in wager layde, Thou would'st be prickt with other sences stings, To tast, and feele, and yet not there be staide: These casts, he cast, and more, his wits more quick Then can be cast, by wits Arithmetick. Forward, and back, and forward went he thus, A simile, expressing the manner of his minds c?tention in the desire of her sight, and feare of her displeasure. Like wanton Thamysis, that hastes to greete The brackish Court of old Oceanus; And as by Londons bosome she doth fleet Casts herselfe proudly through the Bridges twists, Where (as she takes againe her Christall feete:) She curls her siluer hayre like Amorists, Smoothes her bright cheekes, adorns her browes with ships And Empresse-like along the Coast she trips. Till comming neere the Sea, she heares him rore, Tumbling her churlish billowes in her face, Then, more dismaid, then insolent before Charg'd to rough battaile, for his smooth embrace, She crowcheth close within her winding bancks, And creepes retreate into her peacefull Pallace; Yet straite high-flowing in her female prancks Againe shee will bee wanton, and againe, By no meanes stayde, nor able to containe. So Ouid with his strong affections striuing, Maskt in a friendly Thicket neere her Bowre, Rubbing his temples, fainting, and reuiuing, Fitting his garments, praying to the howre, Backwards, and forwards went, and durst not venter, To tempt the tempest of his Mistres lowre, Or let his eyes her beauties ocean enter, At last, with prayer he pierceth Iunos eare, Great Goddesse of audacitie and feare, Great Goddesse of audacitie, and feare, Queene of Olympus, Saturns eldest seede, That doost the scepter ouer Samos beare, And rul'st all Nuptiale rites with power, and meede, Since thou in nature art the meane to mix Still sulphure humors, and canst therefore speede Such as in Cyprian sports theyr pleasures fix Uenus herselfe, and Mars by thee embracing, Assist my hopes, me and my purpose gracing. Make loue within me not too kinde but pleasing, Exiling Aspen feare out of his forces, My inward sight, with outward seeing, easing, And if he please further to stretch his courses, Arme me with courage to make good his charges, Too much desire to please, pleasure diuorces, Attemps, and not entreats get Ladies larges, Wit is with boldnes prompt, with terror danted, And grace is sooner got of Dames then graunted. Uisus. This sayde, he charg'd the Arbor with his eye, Which pierst it through, and at her brests reflected, Striking him to the hart with exstasie: As doe the sun-beames gainst the earth protected, With their reuerberate vigor mount in flames, And burne much more then where they were directed, He saw th' extraction of all fayrest Dames: The fayre of Beauty, as whole Countries come And shew theyr riches in a little Roome. Heere Ouid sold his freedome for a looke, And with that looke was ten tymes more enthralde, He blusht, lookt pale, and like a feuour shooke, And as a This simile expresseth the cause and substance of those exhalations which vulgarly are called falling starres: so Homer and Virgill calls them, Stellas cadentes, Homer comparing the descent of Pallas among the Troyans to a falling Starre. burning vapor being exhalde Promist by Phœbus eye to be a star, Heauens walles denying to be further scalde The force dissolues that drewe it vp so far: And then it lightens gainst his death and fals, So Ouids powre, this powrefull sight appals. This beauties fayre is an enchantment made By natures witchcraft, tempting men to buy With endles showes, what endlesly will fade Yet promise chapmen all eternitie: But like to goods ill got a fate it hath, Brings men enricht therewith to beggerie Vnlesse th' enricher be as rich in fayth, Enamourd (like good selfe-loue) with her owne, Seene in another, then tis heauen alone. For sacred beautie, is the fruite of sight, The curtesie that speakes before the tongue, The feast of soules, the glory of the light, Enuy of age, and euerlasting young, Pitties Commander, Cupids richest throne, Musick intransed, neuer duely sung, The summe and court of all proportion: And that I may dull speeches best afforde, All Rethoricks flowers in lesse then in a worde. Then in the truest wisdome can be thought, Spight of the publique Axiom worldlings hold, That nothing wisdome is, that getteth nought, This all-things-nothing, since it is no gold. Beautie enchasing loue, loue gracing beautie, To such as constant simpathies enfold, To perfect riches dooth a sounder duetie Then all endeuours, for by all consent All wealth and wisdome rests in true Content. Contentment is our heauen, and all our deedes Bend in that circle, seld or neuer closde, More then the letter in the word preceedes, And to conduce that compasse is reposde. More force and art in beautie ioynd with loue, Then thrones with wisdome, ioyes of them composde Are armes more proofe gainst any griefe we proue. Then all their vertue-scorning miserie Or iudgments grauen in Stoick grauitie, But as weake colour alwayes is allowde The proper obiect of a humaine eye, Though light be with a farre more force endowde In stirring vp the visuale facultie, This colour being but of vertuous light A feeble Image; and the cause dooth lye In th' imperfection of a humaine sight, So this for loue, and beautie, loues cold fire May serue for my praise, though it merit higher. With this digression, wee will now returne To Ouids prospect in his fancies storme: Hee thought hee sawe the Arbors bosome burne, Blaz'd with a fire wrought in a Ladyes forme: Where siluer past the least: and Natures vant Did such a precious miracle performe, Shee lay, and seemd a flood of Diamant Bounded in flesh: as still as Vespers hayre, When not an Aspen leafe is styrrd with ayre. Shee lay The amplification of this simile, is taken fr? the blisfull state of soules in Elisium, as Virgill faines: and expresseth a regenerate beauty in all life &amp; perfection, not intimating any rest of death. But in peace of that eternall spring, he poynteth to that life of life thys beauty-clad naked Lady. at length, like an immortall soule At endlesse rest in blest Elisium: And then did true felicitie enroule So fayre a Lady, figure of her kingdome. Now Ouids Muse as in her tropicke shinde, And hee (strooke dead) was meere heauen-borne become, So his quick verse in equall height was shrinde: Or els blame mee as his submitted debter, That neuer Mistresse had to make mee better. Now as shee lay, attirde in nakednes, His eye did carue him on that feast of feasts: Sweet He calls her body (as it were diuided with her breasts,) y? fields of Paradise, and her armes &amp; legs the famous Riuers in it. fields of life which Deaths foote dare not presse, Flowrd with th' vnbroken waues of my Loues brests, Vnbroke by depth of those her beauties floods: See where with bent of Gold curld into Nests In her heads Groue, the Spring-bird Lameate broods: Her body doth present those fields of peace Where soules are feasted with the soule of ease. To proue which Parradise that nurseth these, See see the golden Riuers that renowne it: Rich Gehon, Tigris, Phison, Euphrates, Two from her bright Pelopian shoulders crowne it, And two out of her snowye Hills doe glide, That with a Deluge of delights doe drowne it: The highest two, theyr precious streames diuide To tenne pure floods, that doe the body dutie Bounding themselues in length, but not in beautie. These Hee intends the office her fingers in attyring her, touching thys of theyr courses, in theyr inflection following, theyr playing vpon an Instrument. winde theyr courses through the painted bowres, And raise such sounds in theyr inflection, As ceaseles start from Earth fresh sorts of flowers, And bound that booke of life with euery section. In these the Muses dare not swim for drowning, Theyr sweetnes poisons with such blest infection, And leaues the onely lookers on them swouning, These forms so decks, and colour makes so shine, That Gods for them would cease to be diuine. Thus though my loue be no Elisium That cannot moue, from her prefixed place; Yet haue her feete no powre from thence to come, For where she is, is all Elisian grace: And as those happy men are sure of blisse That can performe so excellent a race As that Olympiad where her fauor is, So shee can meete them, blessing them the rather And giue her sweetes, as well as let men gather. Ah how should I be so most happy then T'aspire that place, or make it come to mee? To gather, or be giuen, the flowre of women? Elisium must with vertue gotten bee, With labors of the soule and continence, And these can yeeld no ioy with such as she, Shee is a sweet Elisium for the sence And Nature dooth not sensuall gifts infuse But that with sence, shee still intends their vse. The sence is giuen vs to excite the minde, And that can neuer be by sence exited But first the sence must her contentment minde, We therefore must procure the sence delighted, That so the soule may vse her facultie; Mine Eye then to this feast hath her inuited; That she might serue the soueraigne of mine Eye, Shee shall bid Time, and Time so feasted neuer Shall grow in strength of her renowne for euer. Betwixt mine Eye and obiect, certayne lynes, Moue in the figure of a Pyramis, Whose chapter in mine eyes gray apple shines, The base within my sacred obiect is: On this will I inscribe in golden verse The meruailes raigning in my soueraigns blisse, The arcks of sight, and how her arrowes pierse: This in the Region of the ayre shall stand In Fames brasse Court, and all her Trumps commaund. Rich Beautie, that ech Louer labors for, Tempting as heapes of new-coynd-glowing Gold, (Rackt of some miserable Treasurer) Draw his desires, and them in chaynes enfold Vrging him still to tell it, and conceale it, But Beauties treasure neuer can be told None can peculier ioy, yet all must steale it, O Beautie, this same bloody siedge of thine Starues me that yeeld, and feedes mee till I pine. And as a Taper burning in the darke (As if it threatned euery watchfull eye That viewing burns it,) makes that eye his marke, And hurls guilt Darts at it continually, Or as it enuied, any eye but it Should see in darknes, to my Mistres beautie From foorth her secret stand my hart doth hit: And like the Dart of Cephalus dooth kill Her perfect Louer, though shee meane no ill. Thus, as the innocence of one betraide Carries an Argus with it, though vnknowne, And Fate to wreake the trecherie bewraide; Such vengeance hath my Mistres Beautie showne On me the Traitor to her modestie, So vnassailde, I quite am ouerthrowne, And in my tryumph bound in slauerie, O Beauty, still thy Empire swims in blood, And in thy peace, Warre stores himselfe with foode. O Beautie, how attractiue is thy powre? For as the liues heate clings about the hart, So all Mens hungrie eyes do haunt thy Bowre, Raigning in Greece, Troy swum to thee in Art; Remou'd to Troy, Greece followd thee in feares; Thou drewst each Syreles sworde, each childles Dart And pulld'st the towres of Troy about thine eares: Shall I then muse that thus thou drawest me? No, but admire, I stand thus farre from thee. Heerewith shee rose like the Autumnale Starre Fresh burnisht in the loftie Ocean floode. That darts his glorious influence more farre Then any Lampe of bright Olympus broode; Shee lifts her ligthning arms aboue her head, And stretcheth a Meridian from her blood, That slept awake in her Elisian bed: Then knit shee vp, lest loose, her glowing hayre Should scorch the Center and incense the ayre. Thus when her fayre hart-binding hands had tied Those liberall Tresses, her high frontier part, Shee shrunk in curls, and curiously plied Into the figure of a swelling hart: And then with Iewels of deuise, it graced: One was a Sunne grauen at his Eeuens depart, And vnder that a Mans huge shaddow At the Sun going downe, shadowes grow longest, whereupon this Embleme is deuised. placed, Wherein was writ, in sable Charectry, Decrescente nobilitate, crescunt obscuri. An other was an Eye in Saphire set, And close vpon it a fresh Lawrell spray. The skilfull Posie was, Medio Sight is one of the three sences that hath his medi? extrinsecally, which now (supposed wanting,) lets the sight by the close apposition of the Lawrell: the application wherof hath many constructions. caret, To showe not eyes, but meanes must truth display. The third was an Apollo The Sun hath as much time to compasse a Diall as the world, &amp; therfore y? world is placed in the Dyall, expressing the c?ceite of the Emprese morally which hath a far higher intention. with his Teme About a Diall and a worlde in way, The Motto was, Terpsium et orbum, Grauen in the Diall; these exceeding rare And other like accomplements she ware. Not Tygris, Nilus, nor swift Euphrates, Quoth Ouid now, can more subdue my flame, I must through hell aduenture to displease, To tast and touch, one kisse may worke the same: If more will come, more then much more I will; Each naturall agent doth his action frame, To render that he works on like him styll: The fire on water working doth induce Like qualitie vnto his owne in vse. But Heauen in her a sparckling temper blewe (As loue in mee) and so will soone be wrought, Good wits will bite at baits most strang and new, And words well plac'd, moue things were neuer thought; What Goddesse is it Ouids wits shall dare And he disgrace them with attempting nought? My words shall carry spirits to ensnare The subtelst harts affecting sutes importune, “Best loues are lost for wit when men blame Fortune. Narratio. With this, as she was looking in her Glasse, She saw therein Ouid standing behind her, his face was seene in the Glasse. a mans face looking on her: Whereat she started from the frighted Grasse, As if some monstrous Serpent had been shown her: Rising as when (the sunne in Leos signe) Auriga with the heauenly Goate vpon her, Shows her horn'd forehead with her Kids diuine, Whose rise, kils Vines, Heauens face with storms disguising: No man is safe at sea, the Hædy rising. So straight wrapt shee her body in a Clowde, And threatned tempests for her high disgrace, Shame from a Bowre of Roses did vnshrowde And spread her crimson wings vpon her face; When running out, poore Ouid humbly kneeling Full in the Arbors mouth, did stay her race And faide; faire Nimph, great Goddesse haue some feeling Of Ouids paines; but heare: and your dishonor Vainely surmisde, shall vanish with my horror. Traytor to Ladies modesties (said shee) What sauage boldnes hardned thee to this? Or what base reckoning of my modestie? What should I thinke thy facts proude reason is? Loue (sacred Madam) loue exhaling mee (Wrapt in his Sulphure,) to this clowde of his Made my affections his artillerie, Shot me at you his proper Cytadell, And loosing all my forces, heere I fell. This Glosse is common, as thy rudenes strange Not to forbeare these priuate times, (quoth she) Whose fixed Rites, none shoulde presume to change Not where there is adiudg'd inchastitie; Our nakednes should be as much conceald As our accomplishments desire the eye: It is a secrete not to be reuealde, But as Virginitie, and Nuptialls clothed, And to our honour all to be betrothed. It is a want, where our aboundance lyes, Giuen a sole dowre t'enrich chast, Hymens Bed, A perfect Image of our purities, And glasse by which our actions should be dressed. That tells vs honor is as soone defild And should be kept as pure, and incompressed, But sight attainteth it: for Thought Sights childe Begetteth sinne; and Nature bides defame, When light and lawles eyes bewray our shame. Deere Mistresse (answerd Ouid,) to direct Our actions, by the straitest rule that is, We must in matters Morrall, quite reiect Vulgar Opinion, euer led amisse And let autentique Reason be our guide, The wife of Truth, and Wisdoms Gouernisse: The nature of all actions must be waide, And as they then appeare, breede loue or loathing, Vse makes things nothing huge, and huge things nothing. As in your sight, how can sight simply beeing A Sence receiuing essence to his flame Sent from his obiect, giue it harme by seeing Whose action in the Seer hath his frame? All excellence of shape is made for fight, Else, to be like a Beast were no defame; Hid Beauties lose theyr ends, and wrong theyr right: And can kinde loue, (where no harms kinde can be) Disgrace with seeing that is giuen to see? Tis I (alas) and my hart-burning Eye Doe all the harme, and feele the harme wee doo: I am no Basiliske, yes harmles I Poyson with sight, and mine owne bosome too; So am I to my selfe a Sorceresse Bewitcht with my conceites in her I woo: But you vnwrongd, and all dishonorlesse No ill dares touch, affliction, sorcerie, One kisse of yours can quickly remedie. I could not times obserue, as others might Of cold affects, and watry tempers framde, Yet well assurde the wounder of your sight Was so farre of from seeing you defamde, That euer in the Phane of Memorie Your loue shall shine by it, in mee enflamde. Then let your powre be clad in lenitie, Doe not (as others would) of custome storme, But proue your wit as pregnant as your forme. Nor is my loue so suddaine, since my hart Was long loues Vulcan, with his pants vnrest Ham'ring the shafts bred this delightsome smart: And as when Ioue at once from East and West Cast off two Eagles, to discerne the sight Of this world Center, both his Byrds ioynd brest In Cynthian Delphos, since Earths nauill hight: So casting off my ceaseles thoughts to see My harts true Center, all doe meete in thee. Cupid that acts in you, suffers in mee To make himselfe one tryumph-place of twaine, Into your tunes and odors turned hee, And through my sences flew into my braine Where rules the Prince of sence, whose Throne hee takes, And of my Motions engines framd a chaine To leade mee where hee list; and heere hee makes Nature (my fate) enforce mee: and resignes The raines of all, to you, in whom hee shines. For yeelding loue then, doe not hate impart, Nor let mine Eye, your carefull Harbengere That hath puruaide your Chamber in my hart, Be blamde for seeing who it lodged there; The freer seruice merrits greater meede, Princes are seru'd with vnexpected chere, And must haue things in store before they neede: Thus should faire Dames be wise and confident, Not blushing to be noted excellent. Now, as when Heauen is muffled with the vapors His long since iust diuorced wife the Earth, In enuie breath's, to maske his spurtie Tapers From the vnrich aboundance of her birth, When straight the westerne issue of the Ayre Beates with his flowrie wings those Brats of dearth, And giues Olympus leaue to shew his fayre, So fled th' offended shaddowes of her cheere, And showd her pleased count'nance full as cleere. Which for his fourth course made our Poet court her. &amp;c. Gustus. This motion of my soule, my fantasie Created by three sences put in act, Let iustice nourish with thy simpathie, Putting my other sences into fact, If now thou grant not, now changde that offence; To suffer change, doth perfect sence compact: Change then, and suffer for the vse of sence, Wee liue not for our selues, the Eare, and Eye, And euery sence, must serue societie. To furnish then, this Banquet where the tast Is neuer vsde, and yet the cheere diuine, The neerest meane deare Mistres that thou hast To blesse me with it, is a kysse of thine, Which grace shall borrow organs of my touch T'aduance it to that inward He intends the common sence which is centrum sensibus et speciebus, &amp; cals it last because it dooth, sapere in effectione sensuum. taste of mine Which makes all sence, and shall delight as much Then with a kisse (deare life) adorne thy feast And let (as Banquets should) the last be best. Corynna.I see vnbidden Guests are boldest still, And well you showe how weake in soule you are That let rude sence subdue your reasons skill And feede so spoilefully on sacred fare; In temper of such needles feasts as this We show more bounty still the more we spare, Chiefly where birth and state so different is: Ayre too much rarefied breakes forth in fire, And fauors too farre vrg'd do end in ire. Ouid.The difference of our births (imperiall Dame) Is heerein noted with too triuiall eyes For your rare wits; that should your choices frame To state of parts, that most doth royalize, Not to commend mine owne; but that in yours Beyond your birth, are perrils soueraignties Which (vrgd) your words had strook with sharper powers; Tis for mere looke-like Ladies, and for men To boast of birth that still be childeren. Running to Father straight to helpe theyr needs, True dignities and rites of reuerence, Are sowne in mindes, and reapt in liuely deedes, And onely pollicie makes difference Twixt States, since vertue wants due imperance Vertue makes honor, as the soule doth sence, And merit farre exceedes inheritance, The Graces fill loues cup, his feasts adorning, Who seekes your seruice now, the Graces scorning. Pure loue (said she) the purest grace pursues, And there is contact, not by application Of lips or bodies, but of bodies vertues, As in our elementale Nation Stars by theyr powers, which are theyr heat and light Do heauenly works, and that which hath probation By vertuall contact hath the noblest plight, Both for the lasting and affinitie It hath with naturall diuinitie. Ouid replied; in thys thy vertuall presence (Most fayre Corynna) thou canst not effuse The true and solid parts of thy pure essence But doost thy superficiall beames produce Of thy rich substance; which because they flow Rather from forme then from the matters vse Resemblance onely of thy body showe Whereof they are thy wondrous species, And t'is thy substance must my longings ease. Speake then sweet ayre, that giu'st our speech euent And teach my Mistres tractabilitie, That art to motion most obedient, And though thy nature, swelling be and high And occupiest so infinite a space, Yet yeeldst to words, and art condeust thereby Past nature prest into a little place Deare soueraigne then, make ayre thy rule in this, And me thy worthy seruant with a kisse. Ouid (sayd shee) I am well pleasd to yeeld: Bountie by vertue cannot be abusde: Nor will I coylie lyft Mineruas shielde Against Minerua, honor is not brusde With such a tender pressure as a kisse, Nor yeelding soone to words, though seldome vsde, Nicenes in ciuill fauours, folly is: Long sutes make neuer good a bad detection, Nor yeelding soone, makes bad, a good affection. To some I know, (and know it for a fault) Order and reuerence, are repulst in skaling, When pryde and rudenes, enter with assault, Consents to fall, are worse to get then falling: Willing resistance, takes away the will, And too much weakenes tis to come with calling: Force in these frayes, is better man then skyll, Yet I like skill, and Ouid if a kis May doe thee so much pleasure, heere it is. Her moouing towards him, made Ouids eye Beleeue the Firmament was comming downe To take him quick to immortalitie, And that th' Ambrosian kisse set on the Crowne: Shee spake in kissing, and her breath infusde Restoring syrrop to his tast, in swoune: And hee imaginde Hebes hands had brusde A banquet of the Gods into his sence, Which fild him with this furious influence. The motion of the Heauens that did beget The golden age, and by whose harmonie Heauen is preserud, in mee on worke is set, All instruments of deepest melodie Set sweet in my desires to my loues liking With this sweet kisse in mee theyr tunes apply, As if the best Musitians hands were striking: This kisse in mee hath endlesse Musicke closed, Like Phœbus Lute, on Nisus Towrs imposed. And as a Pible cast into a Spring, Wee see a sort of trembling cirkles rise, One forming other in theyr issuing Till ouer all the Fount they circulize, So this perpetuall-motion-making kisse, Is propagate through all my faculties, And makes my breast an endlesse Fount of blisse, Of which, if Gods could drink, theyr matchlesse fare Would make them much more blessed then they are. But as when sounds doe hollow bodies beate, Ayre gatherd there, comprest, and thickned, The selfe same way shee came doth make retreate, And so effects the sounde reecchoed Onely in part, because shee weaker is In that redition, then when first shee fled: So I alas, faint eccho of this kisse, Onely reiterate a slender part Of that high ioy it worketh in my hart. And thus with feasting, loue is famisht more, Without my touch are all things turnd to gold, And till I touch, I cannot ioy my store: To purchase others, I my selfe haue sold, Loue is a wanton famine, rich in foode, But with a richer appetite controld, An argument in figure and in Moode, Yet hates all arguments: disputing still For Sence, gainst Reason, with a sencelesse will. Then sacred Madam, since my other sences Tactus. Haue in your graces tasted such content, Let wealth not to be spent, feare no expences, But giue thy bountie true eternizement: Making my sences ground-worke, which is, Feeling, Effect the other, endlesse excellent, Their substance with flint-softning softnes steeling: Then let mee feele, for know sweet beauties Queene, Dames may be felt, as well as heard or seene. For if wee be allowd to serue the Eare With pleasing tunes, and to delight the Eye With gracious showes, the Taste with daintie cheere, The Smell with Odors, ist immodestie To serue the sences Emperor, sweet Feeling With those delights that fit his Emperie? Shall Subiects free themselues, and bind theyr King? Mindes taint no more with bodies touch or tyre, Then bodies nourish with the mindes desire. The minde then cleere, the body may be vsde, Which perfectly your touch can spritualize; As by the great elixer is trans-fusde Copper to Golde, then grant that deede of prise: Such as trans-forme into corrupt effects What they receaue from Natures purities, Should not wrong them that hold her due respects: To touch your quickning side then giue mee leaue, Th' abuse of things, must not the vse bereaue. Heere-with, euen glad his arguments to heare, Worthily willing to haue lawfull grounds To make the wondrous power of Heauen appeare, In nothing more then her perfections found, Close to her nauill shee her Mantle wrests, Slacking it vpwards, and the foulds vnwound, Showing Latonas Twinns, her plenteous brests The Sunne and Cynthia in theyr tryumph-robes Of Lady-skin; more rich then both theyr Globes VVhereto shee bad, blest Ouid put his hand: Hee, well acknowledging it much too base For such an action, did a little stand, Enobling it with tytles full of grace, And coniures it with charge of reuerend verse, To vse with pietie that sacred place, And through his Feelings organ to disperse VVorth to his spirits, amply to supply The porenes of his fleshes facultie. And thus hee sayd: King of the King of Sences, Engines of all the engines vnder heauen, To health, and life, defence of all defences, Bountie by which our nourishment is giuen, Beauties bewtifier, kinde acquaintance maker, Proportions odnes that makes all things euen, Wealth of the laborer, wrongs reuengement taker, Patterne of concord, Lord of exercise, And figure of that power the world did guise: Deere Hand, most dulie honored in this And therefore worthy to be well employde: Yet know, that all that honor nothing is, Compard with that which now must be enioyd: So thinke in all the pleasures these haue showne (Likened to this) thou wert but meere anoyde, That all hands merits in thy selfe alone With this one touch, haue more then recompence, And therefore feele, with feare and reuerence. See Cupids Alps which now thou must goe ouer, Where snowe that thawes the Sunne doth euer lye: Where thou maist plaine and feelingly discouer The worlds fore-past, that flow'd with Milke and Honny: Where, (like an Empresse seeing nothing wanting That may her glorious child-bed bewtifie) Pleasure her selfe lyes big with issue panting: Euer deliuerd, yet with childe still growing, Full of all blessings, yet all blisse bestowing. This sayd, hee layde his hand vpon her side, Which made her start like sparckles from a fire, Or like Saturnia from th' Ambrosian pride Of her morns slumber, frighted with admire When Ioue layd young Alcydes to her brest, So startled shee, not with a coy retire, But with the tender temper shee was blest, Prouing her sharpe, vnduld with handling yet, Which keener edge on Ouids longings set. And feeling still, he sigh'd out this effect; Alas why lent not heauen the soule a tongue? Nor language, nor peculier dialect, To make her high conceits as highly sung, But that a fleshlie engine must vnfold A spirituall notion; birth from Princes sprung Pessants must nurse, free vertue waite on gold And a profest though flattering enemie, Must pleade my honor, and my libertie. O nature how doost thou defame in this Our humane honors? yoking men with beasts And noblest mindes with slaues? thus beauties blisse, Loue and all vertues that quick spirit feasts Surfet on flesh; and thou that banquests mindes Most bounteous Mistresse, of thy dull-tongu'd guests Reapst not due thanks; thus rude frailetie bindes What thou giu'st wings; thus ioyes I feele in thee Hang on my lips and will not vttered be. Sweete touch the engine that loues bow doth bend, The sence wherewith he feeles him deified, The obiect whereto all his actions tend, In all his blindenes his most pleasing guide, For thy sake will I write the Art of loue, Since thou doost blow his fire and feede his pride Since in thy sphere his health and life doth moue, For thee I hate who hate societie And such as selfe-loue makes his slauerie. In these dog-dayes how this contagion smoothers The purest bloods with vertues diet fined Nothing theyr owne, vnlesse they be some others Spite of themselues, are in themselues confined And liue so poore they are of all despised, Theyr gifts, held down with scorne should be diuined, And they like Mummers mask, vnknowne, vnprised: A thousand meruailes mourne in some such brest Would make a kinde and worthy Patrone blest. To mee (deere Soueraigne) thou art Patronesse, And I, with that thy graces haue infused, Will make all fat and foggy braines confesse, Riches may from a poore verse be deduced: And that Golds loue shall leaue them groueling heere, When thy perfections shall to heauen be Mused, Deckt in bright verse, where Angels shall appeare The praise of vertue, loue, and beauty singing, Honor to Noblesse, shame to Auarice bringing. Heere Ouid interupted with the view Of other Dames, who then the Garden painted, Shrowded himselfe, and did as death eschew All note by which his loues fame might be tainted: And as when mighty Macedon had wun The Monarchie of Earth, yet when hee fainted, Grieu'd that no greater action could be doone, And that there were no more worlds to subdue, So loues defects, loues Conqueror did rue. But as when expert Painters haue displaid, To quickest life a Monarchs royall hand Holding a Scepter, there is yet bewraide But halfe his fingers; when we vnderstand The rest not to be seene; and neuer blame The Painters Art, in nicest censures skand: So in the compasse of this curious frame, Ouid well knew there was much more intended, With whose omition none must be offended. Intentio, animi actio. Explicit conuiuium. A Coronet for his Mistresse Philosophie. Mvses that sing loues sensuall Emperie, And Louers kindling your enraged fires At Cupids bonfires burning in the eye, Blowne with the emptie breath of vaine desires, You that prefer the painted Cabinet Before the welthy Iewels it doth store yee, That all your ioyes in dying figures set, And staine the liuing substance of your glory, Abiure those ioyes, abhor their memory. And let my loue the honord subiect be Of loue, and honors compleate historie; Your eyes were neuer yet, let in to see The maiestie and riches of the minde, But dwell in darknes; for your God is blinde. Bvt dwell in darknes, for your God is blinde, Humor poures downe such torrents on his eyes, Which (as from Mountaines) fall on his base kind, And eate your entrails out with exstasies. Colour, (whose hands for faintnes are not felt) Can binde your waxen thoughts in Adamant, And with her painted fires your harts doth melt Which beate your soules in peecs with a pant, But my loue is the cordiall of soules Teaching by passion what perfection is, In whose fixt beauties shine the sacred scroule, And long-lost records of your humane blisse Spirit to flesh, and soule to spirit giuing, Loue flowes not from my lyuer, but her liuing. Loue flowes not from my liuer but her liuing, From whence all stings to perfect loue are darted All powre, and thought of pridefull lust depriuing, Her life so pure and she so spotles harted, In whome sits beautie with so firme a brow That age, nor care, nor torment can contract it; Heauens glories shining there, doe stuffe alow, And vertues constant graces do compact it. Her minde (the beame of God) drawes in the fires Of her chast eyes, from all earths tempting fewell; Which vpward lifts the lookes of her desires And makes each precious thought in her a Iewell, And as huge fires comprest more proudly flame So her close beauties further blaze her fame. So her close beauties further blaze her fame; When from the world, into herselfe reflected Shee lets her (shameles) glorie in her shame Content for heau'n to be of earth reiected, Shee thus deprest, knocks at Olympus gate, And in th' vntainted Temple of her hart Doth the diuorceles nuptials celebrate Twixt God and her; where loues prophaned dart Feedes the chast flames of Hymens firmament, Wherein she sacrificeth, for her part; The Robes, lookes, deedes, desires and whole descent Of female natures, built in shops of art Vertue is both the merrit and reward Of her remou'd, and soule-infusde regard. Of her remou'd, and soule-infusde regard, With whose firme species (as with golden Lances) She points her liues field, (for all wats prepard) And beares one chanceles minde, in all mischances; Th' inuersed world that goes vpon her head And with her wanton heeles doth kyck the sky, My loue disdaynes, though she be honored And without enuy sees her emperie, Loaths all her toyes, and thoughts cupidinine, Arandging in the army of her face All vertues forces, to dismay loose eyne That hold no quarter with renowne or grace, War to all frailetie; peace of all things pure Her looke doth promise and her life assure. Her looke doth promise and her life assure; A right line, forcing a rebateles point, In her high deedes, through euery thing obscure To full perfection; not the weake disioint Of female humors; nor the Protean rages Of pied fac'd fashion, that doth shrink and swell, Working poore men like waxen images And makes them apish strangers where they dwell Can alter her, titles of primacy Courtship of antick iestures; braineles iests Bloud without soule of false nobilitie Nor any folly that the world infests Can alter her who with her constant guises To liuing vertues turns the deadly vices. To liuing vertues turns the deadly vices, For couetous shee is, of all good parts, Incontinent for still she showes entices To consort with them sucking out theyr harts, Proud, for she scorns prostrate humilitie, And gluttonous in store of abstinence, Drunk with extractions stild in feruencie From contemplation, and true continence, Burning in wrath, against impatience. And sloth it selfe, for she will neuer rise From that all-seeing trance (the band of sence) Wherein in view of all soules skils she lyes. No constancie to that her minde doth moue Nor riches to the vertues of my loue. Nor riches, to the vertues of my loue, Nor Empire to her mighty gouernment: Which fayre analisde in her beauties groue, Showes Lawes for care, and Canons for content: And as a purple tincture gyuen to Glasse By cleere transmission of the Sunne doth taint Opposed subiects: so my Mistresse face Doth reuerence in her viewers browes depaint, And like the Pansye, with a little vaile Shee giues her inward worke the greater grace; Which my lines imitate, though much they faile Her gyfts so hie, and tymes conceits so base: Her vertues then aboue my verse must raise her, For words want Art, and Art want a words to praise her. For words want Art, &amp; Art wants words to praise her, Yet shall my actiue and industrious pen, Winde his sharpe forheade through those parts that saise her, And register her worth past rarest women. Her selfe shall be my Muse; that well will knowe Her proper inspirations: and aswage (With her deere loue) the wrongs my fortunes show, Which to my youth, binde hartlesse griefe in age,) Her selfe shall be my comfort and my riches, And all my thoughts I will on her conuert, Honor, and Error, which the world bewitches, Shall still crowne fooles, and tread vpon desert, And neuer shall my friendlesse verse enuie Muses that Fames loose feathers beautifie. Mvses that Fames loose feathers beautifie, And such as scorne to tread the Theater, As ignorant the feede of memorie Haue most inspirde, and showne theyr glories there To noblest wits, and men of highest doome, That for the kingly Lawrell bent affayre, The Theaters of Athens and of Rome Haue beene the Crownes, and not the base empayre: Farre then be this foule clowdy-browd contempt From like-plumde Birds: and let your sacred rymes From honors Court theyr seruile feete exempt That liue by soothing moods, and seruing tymes: And let my loue, adorne with modest eyes, Muses that sing loues sensuall Emperyes. Lucidius olim. The amorous Zodiack.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This poem may have been translated by Richard Stapleton. 1 I neuer see the Sunne, but suddainly My soule is mou'd, with spite and ielousie Of his high blisse in his sweete course discerned: And am displeasde to see so many signes As the bright Skye vnworthily diuines, Enioy an honor they haue neuer earned. 2 To thinke heauen decks with such a beautious show A Harpe, a Shyp, a Serpent, and a Crow, And such a crew of creatures of no prises, But to excite in vs th' vnshamefast flames, With which (long since) Ioue wrongd so many Dames, Reuiuing in his rule, theyr names and vices. 3 Deare Mistres, whom the Gods bred heere belowe T'expresse theyr wondrous powre and let vs know That before thee they nought did perfect make Why may not I (as in those signes the Sunne) Shine in thy beauties, and as roundly runne, To frame (like him) an endlesse Zodiack. 4 With thee Ile furnish both the yeere and Sky, Running in thee my course of destinie: And thou shalt be the rest of all my mouing, But of thy numberles and perfect graces (To giue my Moones theyr ful in twelue months spaces) I chuse but twelue in guerdon of my louing. 5 Keeping euen way through euery excellence, Ile make in all, an equall residence Of a newe Zodiack: a new Phœbus guising, When (without altering the course of nature) Ile make the seasons good, and euery creature Shall henceforth reckon day, from my first rising. 6 To open then the Spring-times golden gate, And flowre my race with ardor temperate, Ile enter by thy head, and haue for house In my first month, this heauen-Ram-curled tresse: Of which, Loue all his charme-chaines doth addresse: A Signe fit for a Spring so beautious. 7 Lodgd in that fleece of hayre, yellow, and curld, Ile take high pleasure to enlight the world, And fetter me in gold, thy crisps implies, Earth (at this Spring spungie and langorsome With enuie of our ioyes in loue become) Shall swarme with flowers, &amp; ayre with painted flies. 8 Thy smooth embowd brow, where all grace I see, My second month, and second house shall be: Which brow, with her cleere beauties shall delight The Earth (yet sad) and ouerture confer To herbes, buds, flowers, and verdure gracing Ver, Rendring her more then Sommer exquisite. 9 All this fresh Aprill, this sweet month of Uenus, I will admire this browe so bounteous: This brow, braue Court for loue, and vertue builded, This brow where Chastitie holds garrison, This brow that (blushlesse) none can looke vpon, This brow with euery grace and honor guilded. 10 Resigning that, to perfect this my yeere Ile come to see thine eyes: that now I feare: Thine eyes, that sparckling like two Twin-borne fires, (Whose lookes benigne, and shining sweets doe grace Mays youthfull month with a more pleasing face) Iustly the Twinns signe, hold in my desires, 11 Scorcht with the beames these sister-flames eiect, The liuing sparcks thereof Earth shall effect The shock of our ioynd-fires the Sommer starting: The season by degrees shall change againe The dayes, theyr longest durance shall retaine, The starres their amplest light, and ardor darting. 12 But now I feare that thronde in such a shine, Playing with obiects, pleasant and diuine, I should be mou'd to dwell there thirtie dayes: O no, I could not in so little space, With ioy admire enough theyr plenteous grace, But euer liue in sun-shine of theyr rayes: 13 Yet this should be in vaine, my forced will My course designd (begun) shall follow still; So forth I must, when forth this month is wore, And of the neighbor Signes be borne anew, Which Signe perhaps may stay mee with the view More to conceiue, and so desire the more. 14 It is thy nose (sterne to thy Barke of loue) Or which Pyne-like doth crowne a flowrie Groue, Which Nature striud to fashion with her best, That shee might neuer turne to show more skill: And that the enuious foole, (vsd to speake ill) Might feele pretended fault chokt in his brest. 15 The violent season in a Signe so bright, Still more and more, become more proude of light, Should still incense mee in the following Signe: A signe, whose sight desires a gracious kisse, And the red confines of thy tongue it is, Where, hotter then before, mine eyes would shine. 16 So glow those Corrals, nought but fire respiring With smiles, or words, or sighs her thoughts attiring Or, be it she a kisse diuinely frameth; Or that her tongue, shookes forward, and retires, Doubling like feruent Syrius, summers fires In Leos mouth, which all the world enflameth. 17 And now to bid the Boreall signes adew I come to giue thy virgin-cheekes the view To temper all my fire, and tame my heate, Which soone will feele it selfe extinct and dead, In those fayre courts with modestie dispred With holy, humble, and chast thoughts repleate. 18 The purple tinct, thy Marble cheekes retaine, The Marble tinct, thy purple cheekes doth staine The Lillies dulie equald with thine eyes, The tinct that dyes the Morne with deeper red, Shall hold my course a Month, if (as I dread) My fires to issue want not faculties. 19 To ballance now thy more obscured graces Gainst them the circle of thy head enchates (Twise three Months vsd, to run through twise three houses To render in this heauen my labor lasting, I hast to see the rest, and with one hasting, The dripping tyme shall fill the Earth carowses. 20 Then by the necke, my Autumne Ile commence, Thy necke, that merrits place of excellence Such as this is, where with a certaine Sphere In ballancing the darknes with the light, It so might vvey, vvith skoles of equall weight Thy beauties seene with those doe not appeare. 21 Now past my month t'admire for built most pure This Marble piller and her lyneature, I come t'inhabit thy most gracious teates, Teates that feede loue vpon the white riphees, Teates where he hangs his glory and his trophes When victor from the Gods war he retreats. 22 Hid in the vale twixt these two hils confined This vale the nest of loues, and ioyes diuined Shall I inioy mine ease; and fayre be passed Beneath these parching Alps; and this sweet cold Is first, thys month, heauen doth to vs vnfold But there shall I still greeue to bee displaced. 23 To sort from this most braue and pompous signe (Leauing a little my ecliptick lyne Lesse superstitious then the other Sunne) The rest of my Autumnall race Ile end To see thy hand, (whence I the crowne attend,) Since in thy past parts I haue slightly runne. 24 Thy hand, a Lilly gendred of a Rose That wakes the morning, hid in nights repose: And from Apollos bed the vaile doth twine, That each where doth, th' Idalian Minion guide; That bends his bow; that eyes, and leaues vntyed The siluer ribbands of his little Ensigne. 25 In fine, (still drawing to th' Antartick Pole) The Tropicke signe, Ile runne at for my Gole, Which I can scarce expresse with chastitie, I know in heauen t'is called Capricorne And with the suddaine thought, my case takes horne, So (heauen-like,) Capricorne the name shall be. 26 This (wondrous fit) the wintry Solstice seaseth, Where darknes greater growes and day decreseth, Where rather I would be in night then day, But when I see my iournies doe encrease Ile straight dispatch me thence, and goe in peace To my next house, where I may safer stay. 27 This house alongst thy naked thighs is found, Naked of spot; made fleshy, firme and round, To entertayne loues friends with feeling sport; These, Cupids secret misteries enfold, And pillers are that Venus Phane vphold, Of her deare ioyes the glory, and support. 28 Sliding on thy smooth thighs to thys months end; To thy well fashiond Calues I will descend That soone the last house I may apprehend, Thy slender feete, fine slender feete that shame Thetis sheene feete, which Poets so much fame, And heere my latest season I will end. LENUOY. 29 Deare Mistres, if poore wishes heauen would heare, I would not chuse the empire of the water; The empire of the ayre, nor of the earth, But endlesly my course of life confining In this fayre Zodiack for euer shining, And with thy beauties make me endles mirth. 30 But gracious Loue, if ielous heauen deny My life this truely-blest varietie, Yet will I thee through all the world disperse, If not in heauen, amongst those brauing fires Yet heere thy beauties (which the world admires) Bright as those flames shall glister in my verse.
