      <field name="fulltext">IN AFFECTIONATE MEMORY OF C. H. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. THE SENTENCE OF KAÏRES. They tell me faith is powerless now, and ancient love grown cold, That we may not trust the sainted dust of those dark days of old; They say traditions are worn out, and the consecrated lore, The long result of ages, may enthrall the mind no more: No confessor is prisoned now, no fond enthusiast bleeds For the great truths that are heralded in antiquated Creeds. The age of faith is past away with its glory and its gloom, And unfettered Reason springs to life, the darkness to illume. We had our Saints and miracles and the martyrs' blazoned scroll, And through the circling centuries rung the church-bell's thundering toll; It was an age of glorious dreams, and it was well, they say, That men should sleep the whole night through till the dawning of the day. But the age of Faith is past and gone, 'tis the age of Reason now, And who would change the noonday sun for the embers' dying glow? Now Science lights her beacon fires, and Faith must be resigned To the mastery of Intellect, and the haughty force of Mind; New truths each day discovered which the Universe enshrines, New revelations dug from out Geology's deep mines, New philosophies to idolize in Opinion's boundless range, New theories drifted ceaselessly down the torrent stream of Change. So thought the proud Kaïres as he trod that soulless shore, Where Oblivion hangs her cypress wreath o'er Science' buried lore, Where the flowery Ceramicus hides the unemulated brave, And the Salaminian waters flash 'neath the oar-stroke of the slave. So thought he, all unmindful how the wrecks of human pride, In its greatness and its littleness, were strewn his path beside; The pride of blood, the pride of power, of science and of art, They were the heirloom of the Greek, the pulses of his heart. And where are they? and what is Greece? She only lives to tell, That land of shadows and of graves, how erst the mighty fell. The Fathers of the Conclave are met in solemn state, Before them stands Kaïres, all eager for debate; What recks he of a few old men, ungifted and unknown, Whom the crozier and the oil invest with a greatness not their own? He threads the mazy labyrinth of ideal speculation, Sounds the depths of theologic lore, and the theory of salvation, And much he speaks of spirit-life, of purpose deep and high, Of comprehensive intellect, and broad philosophy, Of the meanness and the bigotry of hard dogmatic rules, Of the trammels of the Fathers, and the subtlety of the schools; And yet he is a Christian true, his faith may none gainsay; So spake he, and the prelates gazed, perplexed with sore dismay. They gazed on the apostate;—there was triumph in his eye, The contempt of baffled disputants, the pride of victory;— They gazed on one another, and their meeting glances fell, They had sought to probe his meaning, but he parried them full well. Then one rose up of reverend mien, of bearing grave and sage, His voice was low and tremulous, his beard was blanched with age, But something in his look a more than earthly grace did show, Like Saints in ancient pictures with a glory round their brow; His voice was low and tremulous, and yet that voice had power To rouse the grovelling earthworm, to make the haughty cower. But now he spoke right briefly, and his keen regards were bent Full on Kaires where he stood with calm yet fixed intent, “Thou sayest thy faith is true, brother, but thy words that “faith belie, “Simple and sure the test ordained of old such claim to try; “We seek no subtle argument thy secret soul to read, “We do but ask thee to repeat the Church's ancient Creed.” Sullen and mute he listened, he who had flung erewhile Defiance from his curling lip and proud disdainful smile; The colour faded from his cheek, the lustre from his eye, Those accents smote upon his ear, like a warning from on high. Learning, and wealth, and power of mind, and eloquent display,— The weakest weapons of the Saints are stronger far than they. The wit of Greece, the lordly state of old imperial Rome, The Nazarenes subdued them by the blood of martyrdom. They died not for themselves alone, for Christendom they fought Who weighed the world against a Creed, and counted it for nought. II. THE FATE OF COLUMBUS. O for some spell-word of transcendent power, Some magic wand for one, but one brief hour, That land of dream-like mystery to unveil, Half seen half hidden through the twilight pale, Where, tranced in spectral slumbers still and deep, Earth's wisest, holiest, mightiest, softly sleep, Perchance of earth forgotten,—partial fame Caught not the whispered echo of their name; Blame might not touch, nor Praise with faltering tone Mar the bright meed their glorious feats had won. Hid 'neath the vast cathedral's cloistered shade Rest they unhonoured 'mid the nameless dead, Where the dark cypress marks their lowly grave, Or where above them rolls the Ocean wave;— Sank they what time the fierce Sirocco's blast Swept o'er the burning desert's trackless waste, Or sleeps 'mid Alpine winter's changeless sway, Gulphed in eternal snows their mouldering clay; What reck they? O how heavenly calm doth seem The weird repose of their unbodied dream! But some there are who live from age to age, Whose blazoned glories throng the historic page, Whose form the untiring pencil loves to trace, Whose lofty deeds the minstrel legend grace. And such wert thou, lord of the Atlantic main, Fair Genoa's nursling, pride of fallen Spain, To whose once happy realms thy presence bore A parting gleam of splendour now no more! Thou who didst urge the yet untraversed way Through isles unknown, through Ocean's pathless spray, Dauntless, unwearied, till thy sails were furled Before the confines of another world! How bright the scene! From Hayti's distant shore Faintly resounds the breakers' lessening roar, Soft breezes curl with incense-freighted breath The dark green waves in many a snowy wreath. The refluent music of the laughing foam Sounds it to thee a strain of welcome home? Seems not a type the sun's meridian ray Of joy that fades not with the fading day? Seems only;—Hope her sweet delusion flings Full oft round Childhood's glad imaginings, Weaving before our fondly credulous sight A mystic halo of unearthly light, A glittering maze of visions bright and high— O how unlike the stern reality! If sunniest skies can mar their stainless blue, Why should our waking dreams prove less untrue? O better far some wild uncertain gleam From April skies should gild the troubled stream, E'en if those skies their softest radiance pour Where loudest booms the torrent's muffled roar. The kindling brow, the sunbright smile of gladness, What are they but the harbingers of sadness? And doubt'st thou still? and seems that sparkling sea, Whose dancing foam-bells splash so merrily, Seems it indeed of joy a token true? Still canst thou trust yon heaven's unsullied hue? Pause yet a moment, seek yon lowly door, Gaze through the darkness on that cabin floor; Say who is he the unfriended, bound in chains? Scarce thrills the life-blood through his shrivelled veins, The white hair clustering round his reverend head, O'er his wan face a death-like paleness spread, Fast round his limbs the unyielding fetters prest, Scarce throbs the pulse, scarce heaves the quivering breast. What though at times a faint half-stifled moan Declares those chains have torments not their own, And lightning-like is fired with sudden glow The quenchless lustre of that lofty brow? 'Tis but a moment—to the sunken eye Returns its look of fixed despondency, Whose withering gaze lights up with sickly glare Strange and unreal those features once so fair. Alas, Columbus! and can this be he Whose ardent spirit, panting to be free, Launched on the Ocean of infinity? Those fettered hands besprent with clotted gore Steered they the helm to worlds unknown before? That brow—is it the same whose very frown Adoring crowds would kneel to gaze upon? That wasted form the same whose stately mien Once moved the reverence of a Spanish queen? A prisoner thou, who didst exult erewhile In the full sunshine of a nation's smile? Alas, too surely hast thou learnt to grieve O'er blighted hopes that bloom but to deceive, Like the charmed nurslings of the Dead Sea waste, Fruit to the sight, but ashes to the taste. Is there a curse with deadlier power endued, A bitterer wound than man's ingratitude? Our warmest words are lifeless to express That sense of unimagined loneliness, That icy numbness o'er the spirit flung, Even Hope a wreck and Reason's self unstrung! The trustful heart's affection turned to scorn, The trusted promise of a life forsworn, Struck by the hand our own so oft caressed, Doomed by their lips whom ours so fondly blessed,— It is so keen a thrill of agony, That some would deem to feel it were to die. And he has felt it;—he has learned to bow Beneath the weight of that o'ermastering woe, A cloud of sorrow ever dark and dim, But O how doubly terrible to him, Child of our fallen race, yet treasuring still God's first, best blessing—ignorance of ill! A heart so guileless it could ne'er deceive, A mind so pure it could not disbelieve, A burning zeal that scorned the worlding's art, A faith more strong than Reason can impart, Nature had given; and his the high emprize To disentrance her hidden sympathies. Yes, e'en in boyhood's lightest, merriest hour He felt a restless consciousness of power, While to his soul most real truth did seem Imagination's wildest, loftiest dream, The meteor light which sheds on common things Its own bright tints and fairy colourings. Land of the brightest suns, the purest skies, Mother of nature's heavenliest mysteries, The poplar grove, the rich luxuriant vine, The fragrant olive and the stately pine, These are thy produce;—O what land may vie With thee in beauty, glorious Italy! Thy classic shades fair Learning's ancient home, The spendour thine of old imperial Rome, The breath of song, the flower of knightly deed, The amarant wreath to martyr-brows decreed, Thine the pure ray of Raphael's seraph-fire, Thine Ariosto's soul-entrancing lyre! And thou didst nurse in thy most calm recess, 'Mid varying scenes of exquisite loveliness, 'Mid each delicious fatal luxury That chains the heart or lures the spell-bound eye, Each witching charm whose “mute omnipotence” Steals o'er the soul, beguiling every sense,— 'Mid terraced gardens rich with tropic flowers, Where the soft music floats through orange bowers, While sparkling eyes to sunbright heavens above Unconscious tell the secret of their love,— Thou nursedst one those witcheries failed to please, Who spurned the thraldom of inglorious ease, Strong in the faith, whose strange unworldly gleams Shed brighter radiance on his boyish dreams. Cipango's gold, the riches of Cathay In the far realms of boundless Asia, Some mighty sea o'er which no bark hath sailed, Some world in mists impenetrably veiled, Throng on his glowing sight, and he would fain Waft back their treasures o'er the western main, And tune the Babel clang of Pagan tongues To swell the chorus of angelic songs; Fain would he seek on Syrian shore to quell The rule unblest of Moslem infidel, For His dear sake whose agonizing Sweat Baptized the groves of sainted Olivet, And mindful of the glory-stains that shone At dawn around the vainly-guarded stone. Once more should pilgrims seek the “Mournful Road,” And Salem's shrine by Christian priest be trod, Once more the convent-bell's long silent tones Blend with Ardeni's voiceful orisons. Visions like these had sealed his longing eyes To life's absorbing unrealities, Had bid him seek on earth some nobler aim Than Pleasure's gilded toys or War's fast-fading fame. Yes, he must give that young and lovely form To the wild rushing of the Ocean storm, That gentle voice must learn to still the war Of human passions, wilder, stormier far. Yet wherefore shrink? he owns a secret power To nerve his spirit for the darkest hour; (Doubt they who will) at the still midnight given, Whispered monitions spake the will of Heaven; He hears it in the fitful blasts that sweep Nightly across the far Atlantic deep, In the low prisoned waves' clear undersong, 'Plaining incessantly their sunless caves among And was it all for this—the stern command That tore him from that bright voluptuous land, Which not in vain bade nature's self forswear All nature holds most sacred and most dear;— Accents that erst, unbreathed by earthly voice, Sealed the devotion of his erring choice,— For this—to see his fondest hopes belied, His name reviled, his every prayer denied, Himself an outcast from his new-found home, His glory's meed a traitor's shameful doom? So the rapt maiden gazed in visioned trance On that loved statue's lifeless countenance, Scanning the form to her divinely bright, Till in the effort glazed her aching sight. What though she deemed Apollo's eagle eye Smiled on her beautiful idolatry, And heard through lips that only seemed to move The harp-like breathings of intensest love? In vain, alas! in vain, and she must die The martyr of her own wild extasy! Such are the thoughts, (might skill of mine presume To read aright that sullen brow of gloom,) The musings such of anguish and unrest That vex the captive hero's fevered breast; Pressed though the lips, though pride enchain the tongue, Words burn within to speak the spirit's wrong. “Darkly, oh darkly lowers the coming night, “From leaden skies fast fades the quivering light, “Whose faithless dawn but now allured me on “To glorious deeds which cannot be undone. “Woe worth my country, since the sons of Spain “Guerdon Columbus with the felon's chain! “Woe worth the unequal law that matched in strife “The rival forces that divide our life, “Where love and hate alternate, good and ill, “Control the drift of man's ignoble will! “And what is man? Vile creature of a day, “Degenerate mass of animated clay, “Cursed with a soul that shall not, cannot die, “Heir of a hopeless immortality? “Avaunt thee, fiend! Wild pangs my bosom tear, “Reels my sick brain all maddening with despair, “No kindly spell the agony to charm, “In heaven no ray, on earth no soothing balm. “To thee, blest Maid, I turn! When dark and drear “Fortune frowned on me, thou wast ever near, “With smile undimmed, with soft unclouded brow, “Mother of God! thou wilt not leave me now? “And one there is Isabella of Castille., one mild angelic form, “Seen through the mist-wreaths of the gathering “storm, “A child of earth, of more than earthly grace, “More than a queen, though sprung of queenly race; “Her thought shall woo my angry tongue to bless “When it would curse men for their heartlessness.” Dwells there a mystic spell, a power unseen Shrined in the memory of that saintly queen? Or deigns the Virgin list her suppliant's prayer, And lull to sleep the ravings of despair? Lost in the dream of earlier, happier hours, He roams once more through Genoa's myrtle bowers; Again he sports beneath the cypress shade, Threads the dark grove or high-arched colonnade, Or rifles Nature's store for each bright gem That helps to wreathe his flowery diadem, Or, prescient of the future, loves to guide His mimic pinnace o'er the flashing tide, Scanning even then with boyhood's eager glance The rolling Ocean's infinite expanse, No minstrel lay, no music, half so dear As the loud breakers to his listening ear. Changed is the dream;—across the Atlantic deep Silent and swift three bounding galleys sweep. On the red wave, ere eve's dark shadow closes, Softly the sunset's lingering light reposes! And yet more lovely, sinking slow to rest, With dying splendours crown the unpurpled West. Far o'er the waters, as the heavens grow dim, Rings the last “Ave” of the Vesper hymn By manly voices chanted, clear and strong, Sadness and hope contending in their song; But other far on notes of triumph borne The loud “Te Deum” greets the advancing morn, Hope for assurance changed and toil for rest, A life's long work with full completion blest. Bright as the unfolding gates of Paradise The vision spreads before their longing eyes, Big with the promise of the years to be— Tides rolling shorewards from a shoreless sea! Farewell Columbus! Dream that dream at will, The historic muse preserves its memory still. Silent the whispers of the envious tongue, Cold in the grave the hand that did thee wrong, Thy glory dies not; long as time shall last, While live the old traditions of the Past, Echo shall breathe the music of thy name, And grateful Europe chronicle thy fame. Brighter and brighter, as the Orient ray Grows to the splendour of the full-orbed day; Purer and purer, as beneath the breeze The foam-wreaths whiten on the crested seas; So round thy path the increasing radiance glowed Brighter each day, through sorrow's gathering cloud. Never, O never, so divinely great, As when the victim of unpitying fate, Spurned by the fickle world's once flattering breath, Doomed by thy dearest to a traitor's death, Thy spirit rose mid that unquiet scene, By fear unquelled, in agony serene, True to thyself, though all were false to thee, In grief unconquered, and in bondage free! III. STANZAS FOR MUSIC. (To R. H. B.) Gentle mourner, fondly dreaming O'er the grave of buried years, Where the cold pale stars are gleaming Far along this vale of tears;— Fond enthusiast wildly gazing From the towers of childhood's home On the visioned beacons blazing Bright o'er ocean's sun-flushed foam;— Hope's false mirage hides the morrow, Memory gilds the days gone by; Give not thy young life to sorrow, Trust not joys that bloom to die. Fiercest throbs the pulse of gladness Heralding a darker day, Sweetest spring from thoughts of sadness Eden flowers that ne'er decay. Here of mirth and anguish blended Joys are born that cannot cloy, Ending—not till life is ended— In the painless endless joy. IV. “Wir müssen nach der Heimath gehn Um diese heilige Zeit zu sehn.” This earth with its bright and glorious things, With its blue, and green, and gold; The unseen depth of the Ocean springs With its treasure of gems untold; The sunset sky with its ruby glow, The snow-clad mountains hoary, The moons that on summer midnights throw O'er the wave their golden glory; The wonders of art that man has piled In the cities where myriads dwell; The secrets of science that gleam unveiled, In the student's hidden cell; The burning dream of the poet's soul, The trance of the painter's eye; The musical sounds, whose vibrations roll In their cycles of mystery; The sweetness the smiles of home can impart, And affection's dearest kiss,— They have power to subdue the believing heart, But they are not our own true bliss. The souls of the holy their vigil keep Through the dawn of eternity, In a stiller abode than the Ocean deep, Where the beds of coral lie. The ruddy gold of the sunset heaven, The green of the twilight grove, Are a light to the eye of the wayfarer given, To point to his home above. The inspired voice in the poet's dreams Breathes a message half unspoken; The heaven-sent ray on the artist gleams With its earthly reflection broken. The secrets of science genius may buy Through a life toil of many years, They have power to light up the speaking eye But they cannot draw our tears. The dearest gift that is given on earth Is the smile of those we love, But the spirit of man feels a conscious dearth Which that smile cannot remove. The soul cannot rest till it gains that shore, Where, blent in one heavenly vision, The dreams of affection and knowledge and power Are lost in their endless fruition. V. THE POET AND THE SAINT. (ON READING BYRON.) I blamed thy calm and measured speech, I rashly deemed thy heart was cold; No uttered word its depths could reach, No inbreathed voice its powers unfold. I spoke of him, the son of song, Chief of the laurel-cinctured train, Who taught our own sweet island tongue To sound the deeps of joy and pain; Of him whose soul seemed all on fire, With passioned love and purpose high, While patriot pride and soft desire Alternate ruled his kindling eye; Whose star-tuned lyre through Hellas gave The watchword of awakening might; Who mourned by far Euphrates' wave God's chosen sons in captive plight; Who touched the springs which guide our youth, Great master of the unerring dart; Who bared, with O what conscious truth, The writhings of a wounded heart. I spoke:—no fire lit up thine eye, No rapturous praise unchained thy tongue, Methought a calm, reproachful sigh On thy meek lips unuttered hung. Not thine, with sympathetic burst To hail, like me, the Poet's soul; Not thine, like me, with maddening thirst To drain that deep delirious bowl. Thou couldst not feel as I had felt, No heart-beat owned the impassioned song, No plaint thy tearless eye could melt,— I deemed thy silence did him wrong. Forgive me! that I thought to lure Thy rapt gaze by such a spell as this, Thy spirit was too heavenly pure To know such fierce unhallowed bliss. Forgive me! well, methinks, might he Whose laurelled brows so brightly shine, Give all the dreams of poesy, For one brief hour of peace like thine. VI. THE LIFE-DIRGE OF EGYPT'S DEAD. “His relations sit around the child that is being born, and bewail him, for all the evils he must suffer when he is born, reckoning up all the ills of humanity; but the dead they bury amid sport and exultation, enumerating the miseries from which he is now freed, being in the enjoyment of the greatest happiness.”—Herod. v. 4 I have ventured to apply to the Egyptians what Herodotus says of the Trausi. Such an idea seems countenanced by their manifest care for the dead displayed in the embalmings and pyramids, and they are known to have held the metempsychosis; Herod. ii. 123.. O weep for the Living, and not for the Dead, For the dead no more can sorrow; The brief joyless day of existence has fled, And their night shall know no morrow;— O weep not for them, for they peacefully sleep, With the mighty who fell before them; Nile's time-honoured floods by their resting-place sweep, And the Pyramids shadow o'er them. Weep not for the Dead, for the feverish pulsation Of life-blood is chilled in their veins, The unsatisfied hope, the unsolaced vexation, The dreary succession of pains, Are at rest, and for ever;—the false fleeting smile Of the flowers that bloom on life's waste No more can seduce, nor the fruit-trees beguile Which are wormwood and gall to the taste. O rejoice for the Dead; for they quietly sleep, Where no grief evermore shall assail them, In the stone-cradled cells of the Pyramids deep, With loud exultation we hail them! Alas for the Living! O pray that on those Who yet in the dark womb linger, Ere they wake from their ante-natal repose, Death may lay his icy finger. But weep ye, O weep for the innocent child, Just fresh from the fierce birth-throes, For him let the death-wail rise shrilly and wild, Who is born into this world's woes. As a tempest-tost voyage on a shoreless sea, Is the life that lies before him; Like the spring-tides of Nile o'er the sandy lea Shall the floods of sorrow roll o'er him. We may praise the free life of the bodiless spirit, Ere the trammels of flesh have confined it, But the burden of suffering earth's children inherit What hand may avail to unbind it? We may hymn the repose of the passionless Dead, For they sleep, and their sleep is unbroken; But alas! o'er the fruit of the nuptial bed May no blessing of ours be spoken. The last song dies down at the merriest feast, When the cold morn is cheerlessly breaking; Nor the crown of the king, nor the robe of the priest, Can quiet the heart that is aching. For ever the corpse at the merriest revel Herod. ii. 78. Its joyless monition is giving, For ever a dim pre-announcement of evil Is blent with the life of the living. Then weep for the Living and not for the Dead, For the Dead everlastingly slumber, But O let your tears o'er the new-born be shed, For their woes no prediction can number. VII. FRIENDSHIP. (TO G. M.) They tell me friendship is a name, A flickering wildfire o'er life's troublous Ocean; They say it lights no keen abiding flame, It stirs in our cold hearts no deep emotion. They say that love alone was given, The appointed solace of our earthly lot, That love which finds no counterpart in heaven, Which hath no place where passion's fire is not. Highest they prize that wedded love, Which He, the Love beyond all loves, forswore, Albeit the virgin-seer had power to move The heart of Jesus in His darkest hour. Deem we their verdict true indeed? Is there no love from earthly passion free, No gift to human sympathy decreed But mars the grace of heavenly purity? Mother of mercy, thou canst tell! “Purer than foam on central Ocean tost,” Thou, who for three long hours didst prove full well The sinless pangs which sin's redemption cost. And he, the angel-faced Saint John, Whose virgin lips to our dear Lord's were prest, Was that no love, which o'er his spirit shone Bright through the vision of a world's unrest? Deep, deep, unfathomably deep, Glitters the corals pure and stainless red, The while above the unsleeping waters keep Their stern espial o'er its Ocean bed. The burnished coral's ruddy hue, What speaks it but affection's ardent glow? Why gleams it thus deep hidden from our view, Why but affection's purity to show? Then deem not friendship all untrue, Nor love which is not sexual love a name; No earth-born cloud but mars the heavens' clear blue, The purest, sure, burns aye the brightest flame. The brightest flame, nor all unsweet That soothing balm to pilgrim spirits given; When hearts with hearts in perfect friendship meet, Is there a holier bond on this side heaven? Say I indeed on this side heaven? Nay, friendship fleets not with the fleeting breath; What though the chains of time and sense be riven, Love springs triumphant from the grasp of death. Dearest! be ours such blessed lot, For His sweet sake on Mary's lap who lay, So may our kindred sprights unprisoned float Through changeless orbs of never-setting day! VIII. THE PILGRIM BOAT ON THE RHINE. Mother, our bark floats lightly Across the glimmering deep; The silvery moon-beams brightly On the placid waters sleep. Still on the mountains hoary Is fixed our dreaming eye, Though the sunset's latest glory Hath faded from on high. A sound of waters rushing, Where from many a rocky height Wild mountain streams are gushing, Breaks on the stilly night. No other sound is near us To mar the deep repose; Dear mother, thou wilt hear us, Thine eyelids never close. For the earth-wearied spirit Methinks such quiet even Some music might inherit Caught from the harps of heaven. The moon it glanceth brightly O'er the untroubled deep, Thy smile is o'er us nightly Our dreams from sin to keep. Star of the sea, we hail thee, Bending beneath thy care, Blest Mother, we assail thee With the sweet force of prayer. Thine the deep tender feeling Which Jesus gave to thee, The Godhead's Self concealing In thy meek purity. Thou art Eden's fairest flower, For a soul unstained by sin Was the unearthly dower, Which thou alone couldst win. Sweet are the admonitions Of such a night as this, For it gives us heavenly visions Of thine unequalled bliss. Star-beams, that brightly quiver In the blue depth above, Tell how thou art with us ever In the fulness of thy love. The gentle moon shall mind us Of heaven's eternal rest, O may our last hour find us With thee among the blest! Hail Jesus, Son of Mary, To the pilgrim's prayer incline, For the ways of life are weary, O make us ever Thine; Thine in life's early morning, Thine in death's hour of gloom, Thine, when the archangel's warning Shall call our spirits home! IX. MAYENCE AT SUNSET. Thy throne is on the waters, and thy power Was o'er them once; in solemn majesty Queenlike thou sitt'st, as conscious of the dower Wherewith of old the Church engifted thee. Men gave thee power;—they broke it at their will; Thy beauty was thine own;—thou hast it still. One farewell look,—another moment yet; One last and lingering gaze; how bright they glow, Each mosque-like dome and fairy minaret, Swathed in the dying sunset's mellow glow, Where summer sunsets sweetest, softest shine Glassed on the bosom of the imperial Rhine. Fair Mayence! still thy memory lives with me, A visioned city on an inland sea. X. MECHLIN. A tall church tower reared o'er the busy din Of some vast city, an illumined page From ancient missal torn, and placed within Some noisy pamphlet of this boisterous age;— Such hath thy thought, dear Mechlin, been to me, A blessed isle in memory's boundless sea. Methought a voiceless benediction fell Upon me, as I paced thy quiet square; Within the choir a faint unearthly smell Of incense brooded o'er the cloistral air, The presence-token of One who sojourned there, Perchance unheeded; a mysterious spell Unsphered my rapt soul, and the veil was furled That hides our contact with the spirit-world. XI. ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE DOG. Thou wast my one unclouded joy, Thy trustful love was all for me, Soothing long hours of sad annoy; Oh, I could weep for thee! Days seemed less dark and friends more true With thy warm burden on my knee, And blither hope within me grew; Oh, I could weep for thee! Thy fond caress, thine eager gaze, Thy bounding welcome, full and free, Thy thousand little winning ways; Oh, I could weep for thee! When seated in my lonely room, When pacing o'er the sandy lea, Each day, each hour recalls thy doom; Oh, I could weep for thee! XII. STRIFE AND PEACE. I lay on Loch Katrine's pearly breast, My boat was floating at will; And I felt a delirious vision of rest Steal o'er me with passionless thrill. Not a sound was heard on the green hill side, Not a sound from the copsewood brake, Not a breeze to ruffle the mirror-like tide, Not a stir on the motionless lake. The heaven's dark blue and its silvery haze On the face of the waters are sleeping, The shadow-stains trancing my rapturous gaze Down the mountains are stealthily creeping. There is peace in the depth of the blue changeless heaven, There is peace in the mist-shrouded hill; There is peace in the soul when her fetters are riven, And the life-dream of passion is still. And methought as I lay on that motionless lake, With no murmur the dreamy delusion to break But the refluent waters around the boat's wake, That I saw a sweet vision of peace; Where the jarring discordance of Reason is still, And the truth, which she sought, is the guide of the will, Disenthralled with a gentle release; Where the faëry hopes and the day-dreams of thought Which Fancy's sweet spell hath insensibly wrought In the sunny exuberance of youth, And the plaint that bursts forth from her passionate lyre, When her dearest and last-cherished visions expire At the touch of what manhood calls truth;— Where all these and the dim troublous lustre that gleams, For a moment, it may be, in exquisite dreams, Doomed with morn's garish radiance to fade, Are hushed in the transport of perfected joy, Where unsatisfied cravings no longer annoy, And the dark stream of sorrow is staid. Though reft be the garlands aërially hung By Fancy round youth's burning brow, And mute the sweet strains she so rapturously sung, Oh I would not return to them now! For there is a stillness more solemn and deep Than the deadlies swoon or the heaviest sleep; A slumber transfigured with heavenlier gleams, Than flash o'er the young in their unbodied dreams; When Affection's untold aspirations are blest, And the agonized throbbing of hope are at rest. 'Tis the peace of the spirit when life hath passed o'er her, With her warfare accomplished, her guerdon before her; 'Tis the peace to self-crucified anchorites granted, With their souls from the trammels of sense disenchanted; 'Tis the bliss of the holy, the rest of the dead, The peace on meek sufferers unmurmuring shed: But O 'tis a peace we may never enjoy While our hearts are enthralled to earth's petty annoy! 'Tis a joy the fond heart in her visions may see, O my God that such peace may be granted to me! But hark to that sound, like the roar of the ocean When its wild waters rave in tempestuous commotion, And the agonized seaman's despairing devotion Is blent with the elements' din, Till the last dying wail Is upbore on the gale And the waters rush hurriedly in. From the green slopes where Summer's soft shadows were blending, Behold even now the white cataracts descending, Through self-cloven alleys of rock, While the erst silent groves are tumultuously bending, Beneath the fierce hurricane's shock. O solemn it is in such presence to stand, Where mountains on mountains confusedly grand In stern isolation are piled, While the gathering storm-blast with ominous sigh Moves through the ravines, and each moment more nigh Loud thunder-claps boom from the sulphurous sky Where moon so deceitfully smiled, And the answering echoes of far Benvenue Ring faint through the mist-wreaths that darken the view And Benlomond is shrouded in night; While passionate tears from its summit of snow Rained down to the valleys are lost in the flow Of the billowy waters that murmur below, Foam-crested with white. Perchance thou lovest such sight to scan; Hast thou ever read in the heart of man A darker vision of strife? The tears that are wept on the bleak hill-side, The fierce unrest of the darkling tide, And clouds which the mountain-summit hide, Are the mystery of life. Thou need'st not list for the fitful sweep Of angry winds o'er the valleys deep; Thou need'st not pause for the thunder's roar, Or the booming wave on the rocky shore; There is a tempest of wilder din That rages the human soul within. It needs no wizard's potent spell To call the fiends from their native hell; It needs no charm-word of shadowy might To rouse the soul to that awful fight; The life we live is a ceaseless war, While Reason and Will and Feeling jar. There is rest in the grave the wise man saith; There is peace in the weird isolation of death; But here, poor soul, is no peace for thee Till all thy dissonant chords agree To beat in perfect harmony. There is rest in the grave in the stillness of death, There is rest upon earth in the fulness of faith. XIII. SOLITUDE. (TO G. J. G.) There is a sea, upon whose troublous tide Ten thousand thousand storm-tost galleys ride, Diverse their course, albeit the promised bourne Whereto the unvarying compass points, be one; Diverse their course,—and some there are who mourn Those mateless wanderings 'neath the inclement sun, Or where the stars their wintry vigils keep O'er the dark waters of the uncheery deep. What if two barks that drifted lonelily By some strange influence meet on that far sea? Such the sweet spell o'er kindred spirits thrown, The spell, whose wiles too deep for language lie, Striking responsive chords in hearts that own The throbbing pulse of mutual sympathy. XIV. THE LEGEND OF ST. CATHARINE. [PART I.] When the Leader of Israel, From Pisgah's lone height, Turned his far-seeing glance On the land of delight, Where the palm-trees stand stately In Jericho's vale, The vineyards are fadeless, The flocks never fail; Where the corn-fields are reeling With ungathered grain, From the gnarled oak the honey Drops down to the plain, Where Jordan cleaves swiftly His rock-cradled bed, Round whose green marge the toil Of the heathen is spread;— A moment he gazed And sank down on the sod, But his ecstatic spirit Passed upwards to God. For him the archangel Dread sepulture made, Nor Prophet nor Priest Knew where Moses was laid. A portent more wondrous The Church may record When Catharine fell pierced By the tyrant's sharp sword;— 'Twas mid-day—the sunlight Looked down on the Nile, Alexandria's city Was glad in its smile. The lordly usurper The Emperor Maximin. Was feasting in pride, His hands with the life-blood Of martyrs were dyed, Of the tender and young,— Persecution's stern blast Swept o'er them unshaken, The fiercest and last. At noonday the sun From the blue heaven looked down, The murmur of myriads Uprose from the town. Lo! the sunlight at mid-day Hath paled in the sky; Lo! a sound hath out-murmured The multitude's cry. O'er their rapt gaze a splendour Unearthly was flung, A chant through the air, As of angel-harps, rung; On the wings of the breezes Those missioners sped, Till the glory-cloud rested Where Catharine lay dead. The viewless procession In triumph passed by, The track of its glory Grew faint in the sky. There is rage and unrest In the City's broad square, But the body of Catharine No longer is there. PART II. On the mist-shrouded summit The daylight was dim, Where the monks of Mount Sinai Were chanting their hymn;— Through the chapel a radiance Shot sudden and clear, And their vespers were hushed As the angels grew near. The Eternal of old Spake from Sinai's hoar brow— What strange visitation Re-hallows it now? There the archangel's trumpet Waxed shrilly and loud, And the Voice of the Father Pierced through the dark cloud. There the thunder-clap pealed And the forked lightning shone, The arrow-winged message Sent forth from the throne The stern pre-announcement Of duty to man, Ere grace had completed What justice began. God's angels are wending To Sinai once more, But other in semblance They come than of yore; Not shrouded in darkness And dreadful in state, The trumpet their herald, The tablets their freight; Not bearing to sinners The sentence of wrath, But to Him who redeemed them The fruits of His death; Their hands have uplifted A virginal form, In whose pale cheeks the life-blood No longer is warm. Encinctured with glory Her lily-white brow, Her raiment of triumph Is purer than snow, Her smile is unclouded, The palm-branch alone Tells the death-strife accomplished, The victory won. Where the mountain rears highest Its stone-sprinkled sward The angels have left her To wait for her Lord; From the Church's loud anthems Her name shall ne'er cease, Her body on Sinai Is buried in peace. XV. THE VIRGIN MOTHER. Ave Maria! Oh what vision blest Thy name unveils before the adoring eye, Thou, whom alone of Eve's fallen progeny Sin might not harm, nor Satan's power molest; Whose peerless glory Gabriel's lips confessed, The Spirit's bride, the Incarnate Son's abode, Daughter of earth, and Mother of thy God, Since in thy womb the Eternal deigned to rest. Mother and Maiden! with intenser ray Thy path still kindled towards the perfect day, Till He arose, the Dayspring from on high, To crown the gifts of unresisted grace, The love divine, the virgin purity, That made thy bosom His chosen resting-place. XVI. THE VESPER-BELL. Hall, Mary, hail! the western sky is glowing, The sun sinks down 'neath yon empurpled hill, From distant shores the fresh sea-breeze is blowing, Sweet falls the music of the plashing rill. Hail, Mary, hail! that solemn stillness breaking, Sure on the ear a sweeter music fell, The distant echoes of the valley waking; Hark! 'tis the summons of the vesper-bell. Hail, Mary, hail! like words from the departed Speaks the monition of that saint-bell's toll,— Of blessings slighted to the thankless-hearted, Of peace and gladness to the earth-wearied soul. Hail, Mary, hail! the heavens are faintly lighted, The sun is down, the flickering star-beams shine Pale through the mist-wreaths, while on eyes benighted Streams a mild radiance from the tapered shrine. Hail, Mary, hail! the bell hath ceased its ringing, The wearied labourer sinks to early rest, But hark! within the choir is sweetly singing Of Him, who lay, dear Mother, on thy breast. Hail, Jesus, hail! to Thee our nightly greetings Wakeful we raise, though men around us sleep; Thou wilt not chide Thy Church's oft repeatings; Do Thou our souls from works of darkness keep! XVII. THE FUNERAL OF THE LAST OF THE STUARTS. Bright the funeral lamps are burning through St. Peter's stately dome, Loud ascends the chant of mourning, heard in midnight's stilly gloom. See the long procession winding slowly through the central nave, O'er the alb the sable vestments of the dark-stoled clergy wave. Down before the illumined altar fix the bier and spread the pall, Where the crucifix' deep shadow on the slumberer's face may fall; Raise the sacred host, oh, raise it; let the thundering saint's-bell toll, And intone the “De profundis” for the Stuart's parted soul. Scion of a kingly lineage, heir of thrones and sceptres he, Dispossessed, discrowned, and exiled, last of that long ancestry;— Dispossessed of earthly kingdom, exiled from an earthly home, With the Church's princes numbered found he rest in holy Rome. Blessèd end of bootless struggle, peaceful son of hapless race, Worldly diadems resigning for the better crowns of grace. Yet will dreams of worldly honour with the solemn pageant blend, While the spirits of thy fathers o'er the coffin seem to bend,— They who ruled in fair Dunedin, masters of the knightly sword, Whose high deeds in field and foray thousand minstrel-tongues record; She is there, the queenly victim of a rival's jealous hate, Who for throne received a scaffold, prison walls for royal state, Clinging erst through years of anguish to the faith which thou didst love, Crowned with more than earthly beauty in the better land above; Likest her the ‘martyr’ monarch, with his calm reproachful eye, Dreaming over bygone ages, for his dreams content to die; They who strove with vain persistence forfeit sceptres to regain, By the Boyne's historic waters, on Culloden's bloody plain,— Each and all are gazing on thee from a greener, happier shore, Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the mourner weeps no more. Yea, the spirits of thy fathers o'er the silent bier are bending, But no voice of pride or anger with the funeral chant is blending. Hence, avaunt thee, wild ambition, vain regret for honours fled, 'Neath the crucifix' deep shadow earth and all her pomps lie dead. Toll the bell, and chant the requiem, bright the holy tapers shine, 'Tis the knell of buried princedoms, requiem of a royal line; Lift the Cross, and peal the anthem; slowly through the deepening gloom, See the coffin-lid descending to the Stuarts' vaulted tomb. Wave the golden censer, wave it, let the incense' wafted breath, Last and best of this world's odours, fall upon the face of death; Sprinkle now the holy water, once again the saint's-bell toll, And intone the “De profundis” for the Stuart's parted soul! XVIII. “Da semper dolere, et de dolere gaudere.” There is no joy in all the earth So dear as holy sorrow; None, but from canonized Regret Its sweetest charm doth borrow. When the suffering and the sainted ones From our embrace are riven, There is a glory less on earth, A glory more in heaven. And pleasant is the memory Of happy periods gone, When all the joys of many a year Are gathered into one. The concentrated retrospect Of love in all her gladness Which now is in the lowly tomb, O say not it is sadness. For strong affection deepeneth, Like a broad and kingly river; The last smile is the loveliest, When about to part for ever. The merriest song, the loudest laugh, Oh what are they to this? The joy on earth the likest heaven Is the last remembered kiss. Are we not purest, when we dwell On thoughts of the departed? And are not brightest transports pledged By God to the pure-hearted? O teach us, Lord, to bear our Cross In meekness unrepining: Where deepest go the nail-prints, there The sweetest flowers are shining. When deepest in our sinful souls The five dear wounds are planted, We have a joy all joys beyond Through suffering disenchanted. XIX. TO MY BROTHER ON HIS FIFTH BIRTHDAY. Five years have sped! Of thy brief life five circling years, Their mirth and grief, their hopes and fears, For ever and for ever! Thou saw'st not, knew'st not, as they passed, Faint shadows on the surface glassed, Of Time's deep river. To live and die! This is the work before thee set, Waste on the past no vain regret, The future lives to thee; Yet think when Time's long years have run, Is meted to the deeds then done, Eternity! The time is short! As yet, dear boy, few sins of thine With the soft opening tendrils twine Of thy young being! Approving on thy brow may light, Still with baptismal dewdrops bright, The Eye all-seeing. The time is short! Five years e'en now have o'er thee past; Each left thee different from the last, Each with fresh powers endued thee! Stronger each year with fresh essay To draw thee from the narrow way Ill sprite pursued thee! Yet fear thou not! Through senses five though hell assail thee, Through senses five shall grace avail thee, In weakness perfect found! Do thou but to thyself be true, Nor spell nor fiend aught ill shall do If grace abound. Token most true! Scarce on the angelic feast hath set The sun which gilds thy birthday treat; St. Michael's arm defend thee! Gabriel's soft charm, and Raphael's might, Cherubic hosts through life's long fight, For aye attend thee! Nay, doubt it not; I see thee now a fair-haired child, With glance so free and step so wild; Thy laugh rings loud and clear. O mayest thou tread thine onward way Unconscious as thou art this day Of gloom or fear! Blest be thy lot! Soft be thy slumbers, sweet thy dreams, Glad thoughts to blend with morn's first beams. Bright be thy boyhood's prime! And as the lightsome hours glide by, Be thine to mark without a sigh The course of time! It moveth ever! Boyhood in youth finds early grave, Manhood and age their turn will have, Here changes never cease. Be thine on each swift hour to trace Lines that nor time nor death efface,— Then cometh peace! XX. “Immortalis est enim memoria illius.” I ne'er beheld thy winning grace, Thy calm angelic smile, Nor watched how heavenly thoughts would trace Bright gleams and shadows on thy face Beneath its gentle wile. And yet, methinks, I read e'en now The glance of those bright eyes, I seem to gaze upon thy brow, To hear those accents sweet and low Like music from the skies. That glance, it speaks of glorious things No language may express, Unearthly fair imaginings Are pictured in the sunny springs Of its blue silentness. For such thou wast on earth,—'tis mine To love thee as thou art, Where thy bright virgin form doth shine In paradise, thy spirit shall twine Its tendrils round my heart. Then let thy memory be to me A charm of mystic power, To stay the glance too bold and free, When sinful thoughts press heavily To soothe the darksome hour. Far, far away thy lowly tomb Sleeps in the churchyard shade, Where oft in childhood I have come, To watch the tiny flowerets bloom Above where thou art laid. But yet I feel thee ever near, For holy Church is one; The funeral hymn, the gloomy bier, Are but the dawn of one bright year, Eternity begun. Yes!—thou art near, thou knowest full well Our prayers are breathed for thee, And in the Church invisible, The middle home where thou dost dwell, Bright spirit, pray for me! XXI. TO MY SISTER. “Das Wunder ist des Glaubens liebstes Kind.” Rememberest thou our days of childish mirth, And how we sported on the nursery floor, And read wild fairy tales of knightly worth, Or shuddered at the giant's fabled roar? Infants we were, and orphaned of our mother, And all our thoughts were centred in each other. And one there was, O thou rememberest well, Who watched the promise of the opening hours, With love surpassing all that words may tell, And gentle force of concentrated power; She loved us, toiled for us, for us she prayed, Her sweet affection was our childhood's aid. And O rememberest thou the fern-clad hills, The pleasant rambles 'neath the setting sun, The clear-voiced music of the crystal rills, And sweet home-greetings when the day was done At that dear Vicarage where our time was spent In joy unmixed and blameless merriment? Said I unmixed? and what is given to man Of painless joy, what rose without a thorn? “Whoso hath sinned” (so runs the unchanging ban On Adam laid) “by him must grief be borne;” Earth's dearest joys with sorrows are combined, The saints' white robe with blood incarnadined. And we have felt it all;—that mountain home, Our childhood's glory, now is ours no more, Through those dear haunts the stranger's footsteps roam, The spell is broken, and the dream is o'er; There, where of old we came to worship God, Are laid our loved ones 'neath the flowery sod. The dream is o'er; we are not children now, The dawn of Reason, and the burst of Life, Opinion's force, Imagination's glow, The gift of choice, the fearfulness of Strife, All are upon us, and the dizzied mind Gropes darkly for the truth it cannot find. Pray we of Christ a nobler dream to send, A second spring of renovated youth, Strong as the eagle's; till our flight ascend The stormy spheres and touch the living Truth. To whom on earth a childlike heart is given The children's home is there, once more in heaven. XXII. BEREAVEMENT. Why seemeth all around me sad, When Nature's self is bright and gay, The earth in summer verdure clad, The cloudless heavens in blue array? Why seems to me a dying sigh Borne on the mountain wind to swell? The gushing brook's soft minstrelsy, Why sounds it like a dying knell? Droop not the stately forest trees, When autumn leaves fall thick and sere? Nought list they in the whispering breeze The promise of a bright new-year. Close not the waters with sullen moan O'er the lost seaman's sinking head? Nought reck they how the trumpet-tone Shall bid the sea give up her dead. And what if Nature's face be glad, If summer tints be fresh and gay, May not our riven hearts be sad, When those we love have passed away? When standing on the grassy sod, That hides the dear and lifeless clay, Albeit faith points up to God, Sounds it not bitter, “gone for aye?” Dear mother, more than mother thou, When orphaned of a mother's love, Thou taught'st my trembling knees to bow, My infant lips in prayer to move. Thou bad'st me in the Church's Creed All high and heavenly lore to learn, By gentle word, by loving deed, Thou bad'st me Jesu's love to earn. And sure, a more than mother's love Shone in thy mild and saintlike brow, What words as thine had power to move, What guide so true, so dear as thou? Ah me, how ill have I repaid That love which cannot be exprest! Thou in the silent tomb art laid;— What can we do?—thou art at rest. Dear mother, we will pray for thee, Will pray as only love knows how; May endless rest thy portion be, Perpetual light around thee glow! And in that last, that awful hour, When the trump sounds, the graves are riven, Thy children then, so Christ give power, Shall bless thee in the face of heaven. They shall rise up, and call thee blest, And Mary's Son that seal shall own; The Child who lay on Mary's breast, Will bless thee from His royal throne. XXIII. TRIAL. TO H. P. L. The loyal heart is lightest When just disenthralled from fears, The smile of love is brightest When it is dimmed by tears: The snow-drop glitters purest When bathed in early dew, Friendship is ever surest When fears have proved it true. Then, dearest, let no sorrow On bitter memories dwell, The promise of the morrow Hath a gladder, holier spell. And love's keen eye-glance readeth That talisman aright, For little skill there needeth, When hearts with hearts unite. XXIV. SEPARATION. Thou art going, thou art going, o'er the far Atlantic deep, To the land across whose arid plains the hot siroccos sweep, Where the sun glares down the livelong day with fierce unclouded light, And the tiger's yell breaks fitfully on the brief unrestful night. Thou art going, thou art going, 'mid a stranger race to dwell, Far from the altars of thy home, and the friends thou hast loved so well; Far from the dear remembrances of thy cloister-nurtured youth, From the shrines of ancient glory and the citadels of truth. Yes, Brother, thou art going, and we may not wish thy stay, But oft the heart shall follow thee, when thou art far away, Shall track thine uncompanioned way through Afric's pathless woods, And commune with thy spirit 'mid her voiceless solitudes. Tis thine to tread the path the Church's missioners have trod, In the Name and love of Jesus, and with the Saints of God; Ignatius' hero zeal shall be thy fainting spirit's stay, Meek Xavier's dauntless charity shall cheer thy toilsome way. Good is the cloistral stillness, and the monk's ascetic rule, Good the penance and the twisted scourge of the Trappist's hardy school; Loud rolls the noble liturgy through the high cathedral dome, Sweet is the quiet saintliness of a pure and Christian home. But better than the chanted rite, and the cloister's lonesome vow, Better than home's meek sanctities is the path thou hast chosen now; Press on, press on, right hopefully, in the living strength of faith Through the mission's daily martyrdom to a more than martyr's death. By one fierce pang the martyrs gained the palm-branch and the crown, Henceforth by daily dying thy triumphs shall be won; But through that life in death will shine a radiance from above, A radiance that is not of earth, the deathless light of love. And oh! thy toils will be o'erpaid at that last and awful Day, When before His face the sunlight fades, and the mountains flee away; When those to whom thy lips have made the eternal Gospel known, Shall arise and call thee blessed before the great white throne. Farewell, farewell, dear Brother, perchance it may be given To hold sweet converse here once more, ere the bands of flesh be riven; Perchance we ne'er may meet again till the dread Judgment Day, Thou art going, thou art going, and we may not wish thy stay. Farewell, a sad farewell, yet we need ne'er be lonely-hearted, Though the deep sea roll between us, our spirits are not parted; In one Faith and to one Father shall our intercessions rise, Before the many altars of the one true Sacrifice. XXV. DINAS EMLYN. Not for the snowy whiteness Of the river's foaming leap, Nor for the moon's clear brightness Poured on thy mouldering keep; Not for the bridgeway quaintly Spanning the waters near, Nor the rushing sounds that faintly Ring from the distant weir. 'Tis not for these I love thee, Though I love them passing well; The power thou hast to move me Owns a dearer, holier spell; 'Tis not because on beauty's crown Thy jewels brightest shine,— There are river banks full many a one Fairer, perchance, than thine. But none, like thee, hath spoken Of all that met my gaze, The memory still unbroken Of happy by-gone days; A sweet, strong incantation Comes wafted on that strain, And the old association Of childhood wakes again. As thy waters glide before me Through their rock-enchannelled bed, Dreams of other days come o'er me, Other lights are round me shed; Through the old familiar places I seem to roam once more, While loved and long-lost faces Smile on me from the shore. There is a southern streamlet, Child of the mountain floods, By many a well-known hamlet, Through the dear oft-trodden woods That streamlet wanders ever With sweet melodious noise, Till the stream becomes a river, And uplifts a river's voice. In my ears that voice is ringing As along thy marge I stray, To my gaze thy flow is bringing That river far away; And 'tis for this I love thee; All lovely as thou art, Thy beauty could not move me, But thou speakest to my heart! XXVI. THE THREE PEALS OF THE ANGELUS. Toll at the hour of dawn! When the busy day hath begun, That Christians may kneel in life's early morn To Mary's incarnate Son; For at midnight hour St. Gabriel spoke, And Christ was conceived ere morning broke. Hail Mary, full of grace! Toll at the mid-day hour! Let the bell toll loud and long, For the Sun hath risen with a burning power, And the world and the flesh are waxing strong. Through the long hours of the sultry day, Stay with Thy children, Jesus, stay. Hail Mary, full of grace! Toll at the fall of eve! When the busy day is done, Lest Jesus thy soul in corruption leave, Call yet again on Mary's Son; For at fall of eve, 'mid the gathering gloom, His body was laid in S. Joseph's tomb. Hail Mary, full of grace! Toll for each hour of prayer! Toll at morning, noon, and night; Let the loud church-bells, like the angel, declare The dawn of the world's true Light; Till the chimes that inspired our childhood's faith Are the requiem rung o'er the couch of death. Hail Mary, full of grace! XXVII. TO A FRIEND LEAVING OXFORD. Say, wouldst thou dwell where Piety Hath reared her choicest shrines, Where yet on Magdalen's time-stained tower The moon-beam softest shines? Where o'er the meadow and the flood Christ Church and Merton frown, Where St. Mary's spire true guardian stands Above the quiet town? Where the music of unnumbered bells Calls to the oft-said prayer, And the strength and life-blood of our land Is daily gathered there; Where the ancient wisdom lingers In consecrated tomes, And memories of the ancient faith In Oxford's cloistered homes? Or wouldst thou meet the coming foe, And breast the unequal strife, By England's hearths and homesteads In the battle-field of life? Where in streets and fetid alleys The death-doomed masses pine, Where the sickly torch-light scarce illumes The darkness of the mine; Where Filth and Crime, and fell Disease, Have plied their busiest art, Where the Cross is borne in toilworn hands, And curses in the heart? O fair are Oxford's cloistered homes, Her tuneful bells are sweet, And solemn is the long ascent Of that collegiate street. But thou must forth to other scenes By the world's crowded ways, If thou wouldst work a work for God In these unchristened days. Not in the Student's hidden cell That battle must be fought, Where scarce a ruder sound disturbs The luxury of thought. No!—in the city's crowded street, The lowly village school, Where mind conflicts with mind, is taught The Christian's daily rule. The Church's task this day is set In men and angels' sight, Nor sacrament nor prayer shall fail To those who work aright. Her sacraments, our secret strength, Our war with this world's sin, 'Tis ours to dare the new crusade, Ours in her name to win! XXVIII. THE HEAVENLY STRANGER Suggested by Hunt's picture, The Light of the World.. A stranger in the pale moonlight Before the door He stood, His locks are drenched with dews of night, His raiment stained with blood. A torch in nail-pierced hand He bore No earthly sun so bright; A stranger at the unopened door He knocked the livelong night. The cruel cincture o'er His brow, Woven of thorns, is bound, Tears from His eyes incessant flow, Like rain, upon the ground. Not for the chill night-dews He wept, Nor for the thorny crown; But that His own, His loved ones slept, And left Him all alone. The sheep will hear the shepherd's cry, The hen can call her brood, Yet to His voice came no reply, Shepherd, whose name is Good. The flowers unfold them to the sun, Some radiant grace to win; The livelong night that torch burnt on, Yet all was dark within. A Stranger in the morning light, Still at the door He stood, His locks are drenched with dews of night, His raiment stained with blood. XXIX. THE HOLY ANGELS. Spirits blest in orders nine, Choirs before the awful shrine In ceaseless homage bending, Angel guards in love divine Man's fallen race befriending; Burning seraphs who have place Nighest to the Throne of Grace; Virtues, Thrones, Dominions; All who throng heaven's boundless space Upborne on golden pinions; Ye, O most mysterious seven, Rulers of the hosts of heaven; Dread Michael, prince of might; Thou, to whom men's souls are given, Sweet Raphael, guardian sprite! Gabriel, hail! Redemption's angel Who didst erst the blest evangel To Mary's ear unfold; Ye whose glittering robes bespangle Heaven's pavement-floor of gold! Spirit ever bright and fair, Thou by whose peculiar care My sinful soul is tended, Stretch thy shield hell powers to scare From me, till life be ended! XXX. IN TEMPORE VESPERI ERIT LUX. Of old, O Lord, Thy word was plight, “At evening time there shall be light;” Now darkly lowers the coming night,— “Jesu, mercy.” Chill wintry gusts are sweeping by, All faintly gleams the shrouded sky, The stars are fading from on high,— “Exaudi me.” We see each woe Thy seers reveal, Each vial of Thy wrath we feel, Almost we hear the trumpet peal “Cum angelis.” The rolling ages onward flow, The world is hurrying to and fro, Knowledge from more to more doth grow. But not of Thee; opprest with fear, Misdoubting all that once seemed clear, Men deem the Anti-Christ is near. The glories of Thine ancient home Serve but to shew the gathering gloom, The Sabbath of the world is come. Cold is the Saint's unshrinking faith, The hope that cheered the Martyr's death,— Love freezes at the worldling's breath. Yet most Thy promised light display, Lest wandering from the ancient way, Self-trusting still, we fondly stray. Scarce with faint earth-dimmed glimmerings shine The tapers set to guard the shrine, No prophet speaks, we see no sign. Thou only Good, Thou only True, When faith is weak and friends are few, Do Thou that promised light renew. Give Thou us grace to understand, 'Mid prayers untrue and rites profaned, The tokens of Thy guiding hand. O be one gleam in mercy sent, Ere by the judgment cry is rent A flame-encompassed firmament,— “Cum angelis.” Ere yet that last, that dreadful light Breaks but to éternize the night, The dawning of the infinite,— “Exaudi me.” So, when the dead, earth's countless race, Are ranged before Thine awful Face, May we among the sheep have place,— “Jesu, mercy.” XXXI. A CHANCE MEETING. Forgive me, if I dared to raise An eager glance thou ill could'st brook; Yet there was something in thy look Which did not interdict my gaze. Say, were it rudeness to impart The smile-winged message of those eyes, In whose bright depth unuttered lies The voiceless converse of the heart? That night we met—and not alone— One short hour; yet, when some strange spell Thrills all our being, who may tell How many hours are lived in one? I know but this—at thy warm touch New life, new hopes within me woke, New music in thine accents broke Upon me, though he spoke not much,— Music not hard to understand, Whose echoes linger uneffaced; Still lives in fond remembrance traced The parting pressure of thy hand. XXXII. THE MIDNIGHT MASS OF THE NATIVITY. Alleluia! Lord most holy, In Thy manger-throne we hail Thee: Alleluia! meek and lowly, Never shall our worship fail Thee. Alleluia! choirs of angels Sing at midnight-hour Thy glory, To the watchful shepherds telling From the skies thy natal story. Alleluia! Child of Mary Low the shepherds bend before Thee: Alleluia! Eastern monarchs With their costliest gifts adore Thee. Alleluia! still unending Rings the angel-note above; From our shrines in praise ascending Echoes earth's response of love. Alleluia! shine the tapers, Gleams the holly's burnished spray; Alleluia! chant the Credo, Christ, we welcome Thee to-day! Alleluia! Lord most mighty, Come upon our shrines to dwell! Alleluia! Word incarnate! Hark, it sounds—the sanctus-bell! Down in adoration falling, Hail, sweet Sacrament divine! Hail, to Thee our souls are calling, Thou art ours and we are Thine! XXXIII. THE MANGER OF THE HOLY NIGHT. O mystery of mysteries, The Mighty God an Infant lies, All cradled in a manger cold, Coarse swaddling bands His limbs enfold! Can this be He, of whom the seers have spoken, This Jacob's star, of David's lineage sprung? Sceptre of Israel, and is this Thy token? Yea, thus the angel to the shepherds sung, “Swathed in rude bands, and in a manger laid, Behold your Saviour; be ye not afraid.” Baby Jesus, who dost lie All helplessly, all silently, Throned on Mary's feeble arms, Veiled in childhood's simple charms; Hail Jesus, hail! athwart the manger glowing Scarce the faint light reveals Thy humble bed, The while around chill midnight gusts are blowing, And oxen stalled where angels fear to tread. St. Joseph o'er that sight half wondering grieves, But Mary ponders, worships, and believes. Baby Jesus, God most High, Angel choirs adoringly, In thousand, thousand circles wheeling, Before Thy manger-throne are kneeling! Though ox and ass in stupid awe be gazing, Rude though the night-breeze, and the torch-light dim, A light above all earthly light is blazing, The loud “Excelsis” of the cherubim Is sounding round Thee, soon shall Eastern kings Pour at thy feet their costliest offerings. Haste ye, twine the holly spray, Be your offerings fresh and gay, Be the altar-candles bright For the mass this holy night; Hail! Jesus, hail! Ten thousand shrines are gleaming, Their odorous breath ten thousand censers fling; Ten thousand, thousand choirs, as is beseeming, Sound their glad homage to the Christ, the King. Hail! Jesus, hail! great God, Thy power we own, Prostrate we fall before Thy sacramental throne! XXXIV. THE CHILDREN'S HYMN. Hear Thy children, gentle Jesus, Hear Thy children cry to Thee; Self and sin no more shall please us, Hear our solemn litany! Thou didst suffer, gentle Jesus, Bitter shame and agony; From sin's bondage to release us Thou didst hang upon the tree. Thou didst bear the nails and spitting, Cruel scourge and thorny crown, And the soldiers' mockery sitting Meekly on Thy mimic throne. Thou didst bear the Jews' deriding, Judas' guilt, and Herod's pride, And Thy Mother's grief abiding Mute and tearful by Thy side. But my sins it was that stung Thee, Not the scourge, and nails, and spear; 'Twas my sins alone that hung Thee On the Cross, my Saviour dear! By Thy childhood, gentle Jesus; By the pains Thou didst endure, Let not sin and Satan please us, Make us gentle, good, and pure! Thou wast pierced, O gentle Jesus, Pierced that sinners might not die; O let sin no longer please us, Make us Thine eternally! Gentle Jesus! Thou hast won us By Thy Passion and Thy love: Gentle Jesus! deign to own us In the land of rest above! XXXV. AN EASTER GREETING. At the still matin hour The guard of Pilate slept, Sleepless with anguish in her lonely bower The blessèd Mary wept. At the still matin hour A light from heaven hath shone; The slumberers woke what time the seraph's power Rolled back the sealèd stone. Ere yet those slumberers woke, Ere yet the angel came, A vision blest on Mary's stillness broke, A sweet voice breathed her name. The forty hours are o'er, The grave yields up its dead, The Soul in Limbus tarries now no more, Jesus hath risen and death is vanquishèd. Sing, for the woman's Seed hath crushed the serpent's head. XXXVI. THE END OF MAN. I loved the beauty of the earth, The brightness of the skies; Life wooed me with its careless mirth! My birthright and my prize. I loved in smooth self-chosen ways My truant steps to guide, The Syren voice of partial praise Was music to my pride. The lights of heaven shone pale and dim On eyes that would not see, The wisdom of the Seraphim Was foolishness to me. My life and treasure they were here, My throbbing pulse beat high, My step was free, my glance was clear With youth's gay buoyancy. But youth was short, and life was frail, And human praise untrue, Created beauty but a veil To hide Thee from my view. 'Twas not for these Thou madest me, But for Thyself, O Lord; Thou bad'st me rest alone in Thee, My Prize and my Reward. All earthly joy shall fail at last, All earthly love grow cold, Save loves by that one Love made fast To Jesus and His fold. This earth is but a trial place To train the souls of men, Till Nature is transformed to grace, We know not how nor when. All earthly aims shall have an end, All earthly hopes expire; All faiths that are not Faith, but tend To the eternal fire. One aim there is of endless worth, One sole sufficient Love, To do Thy will, my God, on earth, And reign with Thee above. Who have in life that one true aim, That only hope in death, Shall pass unscathed the trial-flame And earn the amarant wreath. From joys that failed my soul to fill, From hopes that all beguiled, To changeless rest in Thy dear will, O Jesus, call Thy child. XXXVII. TO L. H. D. Thou ne'er hast learnt in this world's specious school To sneer at friendship, and relinquish truth; Thy heart, untaught to love and hate by rule, Beats with the freshness and the fire of youth, While thy gay spirit's artless constancy Glows in the blue depths of thy speaking eye. Would my affection could impart to thee, Dearest, one half so much as I have caught In the unconscious interchange of thought From gazing on thy soul's nobility! Through the wide world I sought, and found not one Whose love could do for me what thine hath done. O blest in life, O doubly blest in death, To whom is given thy keen unwavering faith! XXXVIII. A CHARACTER. (TO ?) A sound of voices that have long been still— The sunshine of their smile who smile no more— The murmurous music of a mountain rill, Speaking to memory's ear the cherished lore Of days that were and are not, and a home Lost in the cloudland of ideal dreams Whose retrospect is childhood, but their gleams Light up dim glories in the ethereal dome Arched o'er the vast hereafter;—such the spell Wrought on me, as I gaze upon thy face, And deeper far, beyond what words may tell, Revealing in thy soul the blended grace Of trustful calm with purpose pure and high, Of manly strength with tenderest sympathy. XXXIX. WAR PIECES, 1855. I. Intercession. O save the land that owns Thy sway, Accept a nation's prayer; O Father, in the multitude Of Thy compassions spare! Our boastful tongues were all too loud, Our bounding hopes too high; Too little of thanksgiving marked Our song of victory. Our faith we laid in England's might, And not in England's God; Thine arm was bared, but not in wrath— We scorned to kiss the rod. Death's Angel hovered o'er the fleet, And trod the hospice ward; The plague smote down, the waters 'whelmed, More than the Russian sword. Now our crushed hearts to Thee we lift, To Thee our chastened song; For the race it is not to the swift, Nor the battle to the strong. Yet let the past suffice for blame, O God of mercy, spare! O God of hosts, for Thy great name, Fulfil thy people's prayer! Stretch forth Thine hand to guard the right, To avenge thine outraged laws; Arise to fight for those who fight For truth and freedom's cause. Behold, O God, a people's tears, Accept a people's prayer, And, Father, in the multitude Of thy compassions, spare! II. Triumph. Our English hearts beat high with joy, As it passed from town to town, The tale that was borne on the swift-winged wires Of the battle fought and won. Loud praised we them—the victor host, Forearmed by Heaven's decree To quell the proud oppressor's boast, To bid the slave go free. Through many a lordly palace-hall Rung out the tale of mirth, And toil-stained hands were clasped in prayer By many a cottage hearth. And old men wept for very joy To hear of England's fame, And infants' stammering lips were taught To murmur Alma's name. But soon a sadder tale was told, And for fear men held their breath, As each day's catalogue unrolled Its messages of death; Of the warrior-boy who had stood unmoved Where the strife swept deadliest by, Who, without a murmur, laid him down In his triumph-hour to die; Of the ranks like fresh ripe corn cut down, When the raging batteries pealed; Of the heroes who fighting hand to hand Were slain on that blood-red field. Through many an English home was hushed The voice of Christmas mirth; And orphan tears of anguish gushed By many a widowed hearth. Bright though the fame of victory wrought In the unequal fight, How dread in memory is the thought Of that Crimean night! The stars shine coldly from on high, The flood rolls far beneath Ruddy with slaughter, breaks no sound The silentness of death. Nought save the vulture's carrion cry To mock the dying brave, And the voice, borne on the night-wind's sigh, Of Alma's rushing wave; And, faintly breathed from dying lips To dying comrades round, The murmurous wail of thirst unslaked Save from the gushing wound. O still, while deep in English hearts Are treasured England's dead, For the brave on the battle-field laid low Shall her grateful tears be shed. While yet the old historic names Of Cressy and Poictiers, Of Trafalgar and Waterloo Ring music in our ears; As their renown from sire to son, A long tradition, ran, Mid England's household names shall live Alma and Inkermann! Of Alma, and the brother might Of France and England's host, Of Balaclava's dear-bought fame, Of Eupatoria's coast, Shall our sons' sons exulting tell, Praising the well-fought fight; Praising the noble dead who fell For Freedom, Truth, and Right. III. Our Fallen Heroes. Not here do we sound the requiem note For the brave who nobly fell;— Borne far o'er the Black-Sea waters float The echoes of their knell, Far, far from the haunts of other days, 'Neath the cold Crimean sod, Their bodies were laid with a nation's praise, And their spirits returned to God: But like churchyard flowers their memory blooms Unexhausted still round their ancient homes. Scarce seems it one short hour hath flown Since ye dwelt beside us here, Scarce yet had we missed the familiar tone That swelled our school-boy cheer; We seemed to feel you by our side On the forms where we sit now, Unmindful of the manlier pride That flushed each warrior brow, Till the news came borne on the Eastwind's breath That the voice we had loved was stilled in death. And, oh, when we met on our festal day And the chant rose full and high, We thought of our comrades far away Who had laid them down to die; We thought how the blazoned scroll should record The letters of each name, And the light from the storied window poured Should mind us of your fame, We knew that your presence would still be felt, As we knelt at the shrine where our lost ones knelt; And we solemnly pledged us ne'er to forget, As the circling years rolled by, How alone we can hope to redeem the debt That is owed to your memory; Not by twining crowns for your patriot brows Of the laurel's fading wreath, But by living a life whose example shows What your lives and deaths bequeath; By the strong resolve, and the purpose high To do and suffer, to dare or die. XL. THE MARTYR BOY Pancrasius, martyred at Rome under Diocletian, aged fourteen.. CONSUMMATUS IN BREVI EXPLEVIT TEMPORA MULTA. Dearest to me of all the martyr host, Whose name, like some strange spell of memory, Shifted the rudder of my being, tost Darkly erewhile on doubt's tempestuous sea! Champion of truth! in truth's predestined home, Beneath the unchristened tyrant's ruthless sway, Was gained thy crown of glorious martyrdom: O guide our feet along the ancient way! Glory of Boyhood! in the deepening gloom Of Pagan night our eyes are fixed on thee, Joying to consecrate the first fresh bloom Of thy young heart's unsullied purity To Him who loved thee. Flower of innocence, Dear follower of the Child of Nazareth, Taming for His dear sake each rebel sense To stern obedience in the grasp of death! Favourite of Jesus! in thy trial hour He still was by thee, making darkness light; The wild beasts of the Coliseum cower Owning thy triumph in the unequal fight. And fiercer far than they, the expectant crowd, Drunk with the blood of Saints, are speechless now, Tranced as in ecstacy; so brightly glowed The unearthly lustre on thy virgin brow. Mirror of chastity! as years roll by, Fresh votaries press to kneel around thy grave, Fresh laurels grace thy deathless victory, So strong, so pure, so beautiful, so brave! Saint of our Saxon sires! thy cherished name Was once a household word on English tongues; Forgive the long neglect, the bitter shame, Forgive three centuries of cruel wrongs. Return once more to this dear land, return, Bring back the ancient zeal, the ancient joy, Bid the old love in our cold bosoms burn, Bring back the faith that armed our Martyr Boy! XLI. THE CHILD-CHRIST ON THE CROSS. DOLOR MEUS IN CONSPECTU MEO SEMPER. His face is flushed with Boyhood's glow, His earnest eyes are raised to heaven; No thorn has scarred that bloodless brow, Nor hands nor feet by nails are riven. They have not bared His limbs in scorn, Nor robbed Him of His seamless vest; No scourge His virgin flesh has torn, No soldier's spear has gashed His breast. No crowds press round with ribald cry To mock the helpless Saviour's woes;— Why bides He there so patiently? Why hangs the Child-Christ on the Cross? Not yet are poured those bitter tears, The Blood to save a world undone; And of those three and thirty years Scarce the first twelve their course have run. O why that self-made Cross embrace? Why antedate the coming strife? Why blend with Boyhood's dawning grace Dread shadows of a tortured life? The chalice steeped in this world's sin, The sweat of dark Gethsemane, The burning thirst our souls to win, The baptism of the bleeding Tree, The traitor in the midnight gloom, The guilty Herod's murderous fears, The shout that hails the unrighteous doom— Creep onward with the creeping years. They come, they come, my Saviour Lord, The snares around Thy path are set, The foeman's darts against Thee stored— They come, but oh, they come not yet. Not yet in pride, or hate, or scorn, A tyrant world hath risen to slay; Oh wherefore dim life's early morn With storms that wrap the closing day? Victim of love, in manhood's prime Thou wilt ascend the Cross to die; Why hangs the Child before His time Stretched on that bed of agony? “No thorn-wreath crowns My boyish brow, No scourge has dealt its cruel smart, In hands and feet no nail-prints show, No spear is planted in My heart. “They have not set Me for a sign, Hung bare beneath the sunless sky; Nor mixed the draught of gall and wine To mock My dying agony. “The livelong night, the livelong day, My child, I travail for thy good, And for thy sake I hang alway Self-crucified upon the Rood. “To witness to the living Truth, To keep thee pure from sin's alloy, I cloud the sunshine of My youth; The Man must suffer in the Boy. “Visions of unrepented sin, The forfeit crown, the eternal loss, Lie deep my sorrowing soul within, And nail My Body to the Cross. “The livelong night, the livelong day, A Child upon that Cross I rest; All night I for My children pray, All day I woo them to My breast. “Long years of toil and pain are Mine, Ere I be lifted up to die, Where cold the Paschal moonbeams shine At noon on darkened Calvary. “Then will the thorn-wreath pierce My brow The nails will fix Me to the tree; But I shall hang as I do now, Self-crucified for love of thee!” XLII. SNOWDONIA. Farewell! 'tis a stranger his blessing bequeaths, Refuse not the offering he tremblingly brings, For the harp of the North no fond patriot wreathes, And chill is the hand that swept o'er its wild strings. Thy minstrels no more sing of saintly Gwydellyn, Or of Arthur who routed the infidel Dane, Yet fancy shall dwell on the feats of Llewellyn, And dirge-like re-echo their once potent strain. Farewell to the tints of thy shadow-stained mountains, Farewell to the mist-wreaths that hang on their brow, Farewell to the voice of thy clear sparkling fountains, That merrily gush to the valleys below! Full often in day-dreams of youthful emotion The heart shall revisit thy wood-skirted lakes, Though bright be the smile of the summer-lit ocean, A brighter on them the soft mountain-breeze wakes. How fair are the sunbeams aërially blending On Snowdon in veins of green varying light, And, if from the mountain-top clouds are descending Are not earth's brightest joys ever shrouded in night? XLIII. EUCHARISTICA. Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament Thy Cross I cannot see, But the Crucified is offered there, And He was slain for me. Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament Thy Flesh I cannot see, But that Flesh is given to be our food, And it was scourged for me. Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament Thy Blood I cannot see, But the Chalice glows with those red drops On Calvary shed for me. Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament Thy Face I cannot see, But angels there behold the brow Thorn-crowned for love of me. Jesus, in thy dear Sacrament Thy Heart I cannot see, But that fiery Heart is prisoned there, And it was pierced for me. Jesus, my Maker and my God, Thy Godhead none may see, But Thou art present, God and Man, In Thy Sacrament with me. XLIV. MATER DOLOROSA. I. Salus Infirmorum. Mother of mercy, thou, When the worn frame is racked with agony, When Reason's self scarce lights the glazing eye, And Memory darkens Hope, art ever nigh To soothe the fevered brow! Thou who didst bend in love O'er Joseph's tranquil deathbed, who didst fall Prostrate to worship in the judgment hall The blood of Jesus, still the sufferer's call Thy mother's heart can move. When the chill frost-wind's breath Shook the rough death bed of the bleeding tree, Tearing the nail-prints open, thou didst see Each throb of anguish: therefore near us be In sickness and in death! II. Refugium Peccatorum. Mother of purity, Immaculate in thy conception, ne'er Did Saint hate sin, as thou didst hate it; where Was sinner's plaint outpoured to pitying ear So welcome as to thee? Thou by the darkened Cross For three long hours didst echo back the cry, ‘Father forgive,’ till Dimas' mockery Was turned to prayer, and Jesus' pardoning eye Cancelled his endless loss. Thou through the lengthening years Dost travail with the children of thy woes, Jesus' bequest in death; oh, let those throes Of mother's anguish win to sure repose The sinner's guilty fears! III. Consolatrix Afflictorum. Mother in sorrows proved! Gentlest of sympathizers! Who hath felt Such grief as thine was? Who like thee hath knelt Helpless, unpitied, while the blow was dealt To slay thy Best-beloved? To thee we lift our eyes, Exiles and pilgrims in this vale of tears Wandering forlorn, while Salem's mount uprears Its burning brow, and for the eternal years The homesick spirit sighs. O Mary, Mother blest, Sweetest of earth's consolers, at thy name The captive's chains fall off, the voice of blame Is still, the moan of grief, the cry of shame Are hushed upon thy breast! XLV. MATER CORONATA. Mother, on this thy festal morn From thousand, thousand choirs are borne Thy praises to the sky, While, myriad-voiced, the angel throng Give back the echoes of our song, Mother of God Most High! Sphered deep within the rainbow zone Of emerald light that girds the throne, Thy majesty we greet; Thy vesture of the Orient beam, The twelve-starred crown thy diadem, The moon beneath thy feet. God's glory is thy matchless dower, Ark of the Covenant, ivory Tower With myrrh and cassia stored, Within whose undefiled womb The true Shekinah made His home, Shrine of the Living Word! When friends abound, and health is strong, And days are bright with mirth and song, Virgin most pure, uphold us! When threatening lower those skies so mild That erst with faithless lustre smiled, O let thine arms enfold us! When the hot restlessness of life Hath marred the spirit's holier strife, And on our darkling sight The far-off land of beauty fades, Like summer tints from mountain glades, Look down, oh Virgin bright! Stretched on the bed of agony, When nought is left us but to die, And voices from the tomb Each moment nearer and more near Ring mocking music in the ear, Telling of wrath to come, When time, and change, and death are o'er, And cast upon the eternal shore Our souls unbodied lie, Call us, absolved from earthly stains, To that dear home, whe e Jesus reigns, Beyond the starry sky. XLVI. BEATUS SIS, CARISSIME! I love to gaze on thy face so fair, And the sunny locks of thy flowing hair, And to read the joyous spell that lies In the flashing glance of those dark bright eyes. But thou art wayward, wild, and young; Thy will is weak, and the world is strong; O ne'er may her fond wiles have power To lure thee in temptation's hour! Let no earth-stain of sin defile The freshness of that radiant smile; Still on thy brow the cross be bright, Unmarred thy chrisom's spotless white. Blithe be thy boyhood, blest thy youth, Nursed in the ways of holiest truth, Thine be the draught of innocent joy, The purer, sure, the last to cloy, A generous heart, a happy home, A life that lightens others' gloom, High gifts to highest uses given, An honoured grave, an early heaven! XLVII. THE MARTYRDOM AT CANTERBURY. Through Canterbury's long-drawn aisles The vesper-hymn was pealing, And the censer's breath fell in snowy wreath On crowds upon the marble pavement kneeling. Of Him who came, the world's true Light, All in the winter dreary, At midnight cold in the days of old, The Son of God, the Son of blessed Mary: Of Him, as o'er the sunset sky Dark shades of eve were thronging, The brethren sung, and the arched roof rung, Each fretted bend the far-off notes prolonging. But hark! that loud unholy din The cloistral echoes waking, And the heavy tread that affrights the dead, And clash of arms the tomb's weird stillness breaking! Far up the nave the sound is borne, Nigher it comes and nigher, And for very fear they pause to hear, In quivering thrills the hymn's last notes expire. Now glancing in the northern aisle Those mail-clad forms they see; Hear the taunts so rude of those men of blood, “Where is the traitor Prelate, where is he?” Then raising high his pastoral cross, The Archbishop came alone; Unruffled his brow, and his speech was slow, As he stood beside St. Bennett's altar-stone. “He whom ye seek, God's chosen priest, No traitor false am I; But your tyrant lord, he hath given the word, Work forth your will: I yield not, though I die.” He turned him to the altar then, His hands in prayer upraising: “To Him whose sovereign will both ye and all fulfil, To God most high, above all mortal praising; “Blest Mary, and the patrons all Of this polluted shrine, Denys, the martyr-saint, who hears the dying plaint; To them I leave the Church's cause and mine.” Meekly is bent that lofty brow, The murderer's knife hath sped; They may cleanse the blood-stains, but the guilt remains; It clings to them, the soul to heaven hath fled. XLVIII. FAREWELL TO HARROW. I. Can the sorrow-laden heart be touched with free poetic fire? Can the hand be true that trembles as it sweeps across the lyre? Sweet floats the linnet's evensong on the scented breeze of May, The winter thrush pours cheerily his matin roundelay; But alas! we are too sin-defiled such artless note to learn, And the mists of earth too rudely quench high thoughts that in us burn; Ne'er wept those wingèd choristers, no care hath vexed their breast, They never knew our memories of trouble and unrest. Yet, Harrow, I should do thee wrong, if no fond lay of mine, All tuneless though its accents be, were offered on thy shrine. 'Tis sad to part from cherished scenes, and sadder still to mourn O'er wasted gifts and hours misspent that never can return, And faintly blending with the strain falls on the listening ear A dirge-like under-song that tells the end of all things near, For each change in this our outward life to the still eye of faith Is another barrier broken between our souls and death. Ah, wherefore thankless do we slight the blessings of to-day? Why prize no happiness till it has almost passed away? Is it, that, still unsatisfied, our ardent longings crave For something which cannot be found on this side of the grave? The rainbow tints are loveliest when just melting from the view, When friends are parting from our side, 'tis then we feel them true; Our holiest sympathies are fed by heart-ennobling fears, And softest falls the glance of love when it is dimmed by tears. As Chivalry's sworn votaries watched of old the livelong night, With their banners waving over them and the Holy Cross in sight, Till the third sunrise streaked with gold the ruddy Eastern sky, And they with prayer and vow might don their knightly panoply;— So should the Christian soldier prelusive vigil keep, And in dews of kindliest influence his youthful senses steep, Watching his arms, ere he essay the battle-field of life, To anneal his heart in purity, and nerve him for the strife. Bright visions thronged their warrior souls, and lit their kindling eyes, Who knelt at midnight hour to muse on knighthood's high emprise. They dreamt, perchance, of ladye-love, and the tournay's glittering ring, How the pen their deeds should chronicle, and the minstrel o'er them sing, Or vowed a pilgrim vow to wrest from miscreant hands and rude The sepulchre where Christ was laid, the soil that drank His blood;— Solemn and glorious dreams, too oft doomed with the morn to fade, When Time and Chance on yearning hopes their icy touch have laid! Even thus in boyhood's eager glance, while all around is bright, Young Fancy revels aureole-crowned with rays of summer light, While yet the heart beats fresh and true, and love is not a name, But a living power to disentrance the affections' hidden flame; Ere the smooth cheek has lost its bloom, and thought its early glow, Or the witness mark of shame hath scarred the yet unfurrowed brow, Ere manhood's frown has withered the fragrance of our youth, And manhood's wisdom turned to doubt the blessed hope of truth. How bright the promise of that hour, how sweet in memory still, Its careless mirth, its keen desire, its ignorance of ill! Dear as the grasp of brother hands, when friends are doomed to part, Whose words shall wake through after years, deep echoes in the heart,— And pleasant as to longing eyes the mellowed sunset ray That cheers the unrelenting gloom of a November day,— So sweet the memory yet so sad, so pleasant the regret, That 'minds one of those schoolboy days we never can forget. Farewell, farewell,—'tis meet once more to wake the dying strain, A gentle cadence, ere it sink never to rise again, As on the incense-breathing air low-chaunted requiems swell, As sounds the lingering music of the far-off midnight bell. Youth's dreams are like spring flowerets, that blossom but to die, When the scorching heat of summer suns glares fiercely from on high; Memory and Hope within my soul future and past are blending, The dream is o'er, the morning breaks, but who may tell the ending? II. ANOTHER FAREWELL. Sweet is the memory of the days gone by The well-known voice, the loved familiar spot We trod so oft, ere Youth's gay buoyancy Was lost for aye, in Manhood's sterner lot. 'Tis sweet to muse on Childhood's opening prime, On school-boy's days of careless merriment, When life rolled o'er us like a Sunday chime Of church-bells, breathing gladness and content. How bright the dreams of Boyhood's marvelling hour, The first warm blush of young affection's glow, The dawning sense of half-unconscious power, The ready tear which age forbids to flow:— These once were ours; and, as we linger near This churchyard-stone, their memory wakes again At thought of him, who loved to murmur here The prelude music of that thrilling strain, Whose full-voiced echoes sounded round our youth, Striking the key-note of our inner lives, Blending strange shapes in guise of seeming truth, With spell, whose witchery still, disowned, survives “Byron's Tombstone,” in Harrow Churchyard.. Here passed his boyhood, 'mid the smiles and tears That chequer life's sweet April; here were nursed The powers for good or ill, in after years Doomed, like the thunder's deafening crash, to burst On souls that felt his mastery, while the keen, Swift lightning-flash their every thought revealed, Playing o'er mountain-sides of fadeless green, Gilding deep founts, erewhile in darkness sealed. Dread power was thine for good or ill, alas! Full oft misused for evil! But this scene Suits not with sinful memories,—let them pass,— Here we but muse of thee as thou hast been In youth's first spring-time. Here no word of blame, No bitter curse shall over thee be said: Speak here your blessing on the Poet's name, Breathe your kind requiem for the noble dead! XLIX. REQUIEM ÆTERNAM. To die, and be at rest Beneath the churchyard sod, The corpse in cere-cloths drest, The spirit with its God. To die, and be at rest, Lapped in ethereal fires, Nor sight nor thought unblest To kindle base desires. To die, and be at rest Beyond the world's annoy, No cares to vex the breast, No tears to trouble joy. To die, and be at rest Where slander's tongue is still, Where praise nor mars our best Nor consecrates our ill. To die, and be at rest Where earthly tumults cease, Where storms may ne'er infest The haven of our peace. To die, and be at rest With them that part no more, Rocked gently on the breast Of loved ones gone before. To die, and be at rest Beyond the power of sin, Love an abiding Guest The ransomed soul within. To die, and be at rest, For this our natures crave, The last home of the blest, The world beyond the grave. To die, and be at rest, 'Tis childhood's earliest dream, In terror unexprest Shrinking from life's dark stream. To die, and be at rest, 'Tis manhood's bitter cry, With thankless toils opprest Of wasted energy. To die, and be at rest, Old age with feeble moan Echoes the long request To lay its burden down. To die, and be at rest, It is a Christian prayer, For death is God's behest, Christ and His Saints are there. L. MEDIÆVAL INFLUENCES. (A Fragment.) It was upon a chill autumnal night, Such as, full oft, our changeful climate sends, While summer lingering, as in act to go, Sojourns awhile amid September winds;— On such a night, by ocean's moon-lit marge I wandered, where upon the shelving sand Billows in silvery succession broke Incessantly, with their clear orisons Mingling my last farewells. And in their sound, Whose soft vibration hung upon the ear Of midnight, memories of another world, Dim echoes of the past, mysteriously Blent with the vision of these latter days. Methought upon a mist-enshrouded plain, In wavy outline partially revealed, Earth's mail-clad armies battled valiantly; Ah me! in what unholy, godless strife, What dissonance of feudal anarchy! For knighthood, holiest ordinance of man, The guardian sworn of Faith and Constancy, Raged in tumultuous forgetfulness Of virgin honour, and the name of Christ. The Church (methought) of glory dispossessed, Herself a very battle-field of strife, Audibly mourned her failing unity, A worldly priesthood, and the din unblest Of jarring systems, the ambitious wrath Of grasping princes, apostolic zeal An empty name, by self-indulgent monks And warrior priests indignantly forsworn. O was it then a wild, unreal spell, The phantasy of a disordered brain, That dream of mediæval sanctity? Sorrowing I gazed with half-averted eye, When sudden on the gathering storm was laid A potent incantation, and thy name, O Rome, a gentle yet majestic voice, Breathed o'er the unquiet nations, “Peace, be still!” Earth heard and trembled; from her monarchs' grasp, By merciful compulsion overawed, Low fell the sceptre, impiously raised To strike the crozier; Chivalry uprose, A beautiful creation, new-baptized, And cleansed from taint of earthliness impure By reverence for our Lady; and the Church Was felt once more, the sinner's healing balm, The mourner's refuge, and the wanderer's home, The worldling's dread, a quiet anchorage Of troubled spirits, a reality Magnificently present on the earth, Signing her tinsel glories with the cross. 'Twas as the voiceless benediction laid On the few kneelers at the lamp-lit shrine Of some monastic chancel, watching there All night before the blessed Sacrament, The vouchsafed presence of the Holy One. O Rome, most hallowed, most benignant power, Do they not err, who deem thy gentle sway A godless usurpation; who would fain Blot thy remembrance from the blazoned scroll Of the recorded past; who will not see The vanquished perils, and the thwarted aims, The sweet corrections and the heedful love Owed to thy delegated Sovereignty, A voice not uncommissioned to proclaim The else unheeded mandates of the Church? Nor therefore deem our common Lord dethroned, Our Lord and hers, because at Mary's shrine, In high ecstatic self-devotion wrapt, The feudal warrior learnt to prize aright The unselfish ardour of chivalric love. To such, methought, a Saint of that dark age, Dark to our earth-dimmed eyes, made clam reply; “Who kneel to Mary, kneel to Mary's Son, “And therefore to the Mother-Maid we cry, “Because her Son is God; no rite profane, “No goddess-worshipping idolatry “Is ours; to Him due honour we accord “Unlimited, unquestioning, entire, “The perfect service of obedient love; “To her such limited and mediate power “As may befit a creature glorified, “Brightest and purest of the white-robed band “Who stand for aye before the throne of God, “One who perchance may pour, and not in vain, “An intercession for the little flock “Purchased by Jesu's all-redeeming Blood.” LI. IN MEMORIAM C. H. C. Accept, dear friend, the tribute-note Of this my last farewell, While yet the echoes round me float Of thy deep dying knell. What though the heart be all on fire With thoughts of other years, Cold is the hand that sweeps the lyre, The eye is dim with tears. How many a word was left unsaid, How much was unconfest!— Can earthly memories vex the dead In that far land of rest? Nay, clearer than yon evening star, With perfect radiance decked, Blame cannot fret nor passion mar The peace of God's elect. But we are left to breast the wave, When thou hast gained the shore; To pass through sorrow to the grave, When thou canst weep no more. God grant our meeting, brother dear, In that sweet home above, Where they that chose His service here Are guerdoned with His love!</field>
