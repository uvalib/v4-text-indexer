Listen to me, and I will tell you a wonderful and true story of Charles, the doughty king who recovered the crown of thorns, the nails, and the other sacred relics, and brought them to St Denys. Charles had collected all his barons, and advanced on Morimoud. Oliver, who commanded the advance-guard, is suddenly attacked by the Saracens in the valley of Rayer. He himself is wounded, and the French are on the point of being put to flight, when Charles with his old knights comes to their aid.

Olyuer rideþ wyþ sper &amp; scheld in-to þe pauylloun: Many was þe kny?t þat him beheld wan he spak ys resoun: To þe kyng said he among þe pres “y haue þe serued ?ore In werre &amp; eke in lond of pes wel seuen ?er &amp; more, &amp; euere suþþe y haue me raid redely to þy seruyse, &amp; ?ut i holde me wel apaid to don þe same gyse, for y haue me preued on þy werre to fi?te a?en þy foes.

To þe Sarasyns ?yuen þay hard batail &amp; slowe him alle aboute; Wan hure speres gunne to faille hure swerdes þay drowen oute. Of summe þay smyte of legges &amp; armes &amp; of sum þe heuedes þay gerde, &amp; summe þay stykede þor? guttes &amp; þearmes so foule with hem þei serde.

Wan þay y-se?e þat þes frensche men ?yue hem so scherp a schour, Faste a-wayward gunne þay flen þay sparede no deshonour. Ac þe kyng of Combles, sir Sortybran þat was hure gouernour, þanne cryede, “lordes, comeþ a?en &amp; schewyaþ ?our vygour! We wolleþ sle þus frensche her ri?t in clene bataille.” Wiþ þat þe Sarsyns reliede hem þer &amp; þe frensche men gunne tassaille. þe Sarsyns þanne with gode herte fo?te &amp; sparede hem na?t, Harde strokes &amp; eke smerte to þe frenschemen þanne þay ra?t. þay caste til hem gleyues &amp; launce falsar? &amp; feþerd dart, &amp; slowe þer-wiþ kni?tes of fraunce &amp; ?aue hem batail hard.

So sherplich þo on hem þay fulle þes Sarsyns al wiþ strengþe, þat þe frensche men þai made reculle wel an akers lengþe. þanne þay asayllede Scot Gwylmer &amp; toke him a-force fyne, &amp; eke sir Berard of Moundisder &amp; Geffray of Langeuyne; &amp; þe ferþe þay token al-so þere sir Aubry, a noble kny?t, &amp; alle þay arn of þe doþþepere þat þo buþe taken in fy?t. þus barons weren take wiþ force &amp; harde y-bounde y trowe, And suþþen y-set alle an horce &amp; awayward with hem þay drowe. Ac wan Charlis hit wiste &amp; se? for hymen hym gan to maye: Ofte a cride to his host an he? “now prikeaþ kny?tes, y praye; If þay hymen ledeþ þus away my doþþepers þat buþ y-take, þanne ys my worschip lost for ay certes for þat sake.” þanne mi?te me sen þe frensche men after þis Sarsyn? chace, þay huld hur scheldes bi-forn hem &amp; harde hem bi-gunne enbrace. At aualyng of an hulle þe frensche han þey of-take, &amp; wanne þ? frensche men on hem fulle þe Sarasyns gunne to quake, þan comencede a batail newe by-twene þes hostes two, þe Sarasyns sone þay al-to-hewe þat þay of-token þo. Rolond drow out durendal þat schon so siluer bri?t, For O[lyuer] hym was wo wyþ al þat he ne had him in si?t. Ac suþþe þat he ne may hym seen a þo?te þan or he wente Amonges hem þer a-wreke is teen sone wyþ swerdes dente. þe furste he mette hi?t engwylard a Sarsyn of gret renoun, þor? helm &amp; coyphe þat wern hard he clef ys hed a-doun; He fel doun ded oppon þe ground is lifdawes wern ido; “Rest,” quaþ he, “þou heþene hound” &amp; anoþerne he lawte þo, &amp; ?af him a strok al on ys yre with durendal is brond: His heued gerte he fro þe swyre þat it tomblede on þe sond.

Roland prykede after blyf for þe loue of Olyuer þan, &amp; potte an auenture ys owe lif to rescuwy þat do?ty man. Ogier deneys on Bryafort wiþ him prikede al-so, And ?af Roland god coumfort þat chyuachee for to do. Now chacieþ þay þe Sarseneys þis noble kni?tes tweye, Ouer mountayns &amp; ouer valeys ne dradde þai for non aye. To rescuwe þis barouns gode euere þay prykede faste, As noble men &amp; he? of mode þat of noþyng wern agaste. Ac al þat þay of-take mi?te as þay prikede þo, With dent of swerd þay slo?en him ri?t &amp; prikede forþ after mo. þus þay prikede, þuse two baroun hure frendes to rescowe, Til þe sonne was ne? go doun &amp; gan to sitte lowe.

Wel longe hadde þys chas y-lest of þys kny?tes tweyn, þe Sarsyns fle?e &amp; no?t ne sest war-for þay turnde a?eyn. Al ful were þe weyes almost of sarasyns þay han a-sleyn, Ac for Rolond haueþ is purpos lost þan was he noþyng fayn. Charlis saw þ? sonne ne? set þat red þan schon &amp; lowe, In his pauillouns to haue recet þiderward gan he drawe. &amp; wiþ his host he tornde a?eyn wiþ a wel yuele chere, &amp; euere he si?te &amp; gan to seyn ‘Alas’ þat he cam theere: “Alas Olyuer, my gode kni?t for þe myn herte ys cold. Alas! þe tyme þou scholdest fi?t with þat Sara?yn bold. Alas! now buþ myn barouns wy?t fro me y-take in hold. Alas! þe tyme þat in mi si?t þis mischef falle schold.” Duk neymes ihurde ys mone &amp; saide to þe kyng, “Auenge þe her-of eft sone &amp; let now þy mornyng. þyn barons schulleþ be delyuered wel wiþ þe hilp of god almi?t, &amp; þe Sarasyns, be þay no?t so fel schullaþ abigge þys ounri?t.” þan kyng C[harlis] swer is oþ ne scholde he neuere be fayn, Til he had him mad hem wroþ &amp; his barons gete a?ayn. As þey ride so on þe way sechyng on þe playne, þey founde Firumbras þar a lay vnder a tre of frayne. Wan Charlis y-saw him war he was he ne?hedem &amp; sayde, “Maugree haue þou, Fyrumbras for þy foul mysbrayde; y haue y-lost Erld Olyuer þys day for þy sake, &amp; duk Berard of Moundesdier &amp; oþre þat buþ y-take.” Fyr[umbras] herde what Charlis saide &amp; made a grete sy?yng, oppon ys arm ys heued a layde &amp; humbliche ansuered þe kyng, “A charlis, kyng of fraunce ne spek þer-of no more; y haue ynow of greuaunce &amp; ?ut me ys wers þer-fore.

For godes loue, sir Emperour tak pite of me here, It turneþ ?ow to gret deshonour &amp; y daye in þis manere.” Wan Charlis had herd þis answere is herte to himward feld; He het .iiij. kni?tes him arere &amp; bere him forþ on a scheld. Softe þus kny?tes þan him bere to þe kyngis pauylloun &amp; of hur handes ne let him nere til Charlis het set him doun. Charlis hemself &amp; sire Oger ounarmede him þo anon, &amp; wan he was sengle amoung hem þer hy auysed is schap echon. Brode scholdres had he with-alle &amp; brustes ful quarree, Wyþ longe sydes &amp; middel smalle a wel schape man was hee.

Alle þat him be-hulde þan among hem þai saide þere, þat Olyuer was a do?ty man wan hym he mi?t conquere. A wel fair kni?t was Firumbras ounarmid wan he lay, Ac ys Fysage al discolourid was for is blod was gon away; thre siþes a sounede afforn hem þere for angwys of ys wounde, By-fore þe lordes þat þar were wiþ-inne a litel stonde. Charlis tok pite of þat si?t an archebisschop a clepede anon, And het him sone þat he wer di?t to blessy þe holy fanston, þat he were fulled þat ilke ni?t &amp; ymad cristenmon. þe prelat dide al so he hi?t &amp; plungede him sone þer-on. þan was cristned sir Firumbras a man of gret deffens, ys name ther y-chaunged was &amp; was ihote Florens, ac þo? me tornde þar ys name as þe manere was, Euere ?ut after a baar þe same &amp; men cliped him Firumbras.

Torne we a?en in tour sawes &amp; speke we atte frome Of Erld Olyuer &amp; his felawes þat Sara?yns habbeþ ynome. þe Sara?yns prykyaþ faste away as harde as þay may hye, And ledeþ wiþ hymen þat riche pray þe flour of Chyualarye, By hilles &amp; roches swyþe horrible on hur cors þay wente, And er þay come to Mantrible neuere þay ne astente. Ouer þe brigge þay gunne ride þat was ful huge of lengthe, In þe Cite þat ny?t to abyde to kep hem þer in strengthe.

Ac Cornyfer is helm was herd &amp; mad þe strok to glente; þan Cornyfer to Roland werd a sturne strok gan slente: Ac Ro[land] kepede hym fram ys berd &amp; with his scheld him hente; bot þor? is scheld þe strok him sprong and þe schild to-chon, ac ys habryioun was ful strong it ne mi?te no ferrer gon.

At a wyndowe as Ro[land] lay lynynge &amp; lokede out, þan Ameral atte is soper he of-say sittynge vnder shrout. Wanne he haþ aperceuede apertely þan Amerel &amp; his aray, To hem he clepede ys company &amp; þus he gan to say: “Lordes, be-holdeþ þan Amerel ?ounder out on þe grene, At is soper ys he me semeþ wel it doþ myn herte tene. Hit were me þynkþ a fair viage to letten him of his purpos.” þan saide þe other barnage “fonde we to greue our fos.” Sone were þys noble barouns y-armed in sykere wedis, &amp; as fers as any lyouns þay sterte vp-on hure stedis. þe damesels duden vp þe ?eate &amp; þe dra?tbrigge lete adoun, And þay fareþ out þer-ate stoutelich ech baroun. Balan hymen aperceyueþ anan as þai come on a mede; Of þe si?te agrise he gan and wax ne? wod for drede. Aspayllard of nubbye clepede he þan &amp; þus til him he sede: “Do Cosyn anon þyn Armys aan &amp; aray þe in syker wede. Lo whar þay comeþ stout &amp; bold þe frensche men of þe tour; þay þenkeþ make our soper cold þai casteþ hem to þat labour.” “Al redy, sire,” Aspaylard sede and armede hym þanne anon, And sone haþ he take ys stede &amp; smertly he was oppon: Ys scheld he takeþ in þat nede launce ne kepede he non, A dart takþ he in his hond for drede &amp; forþ he ys a-gon. Roland was þe furste of alle þat rod afforeward, þe Sarsyn þo?te him for to quelle &amp; launceþ til him þe dart; þe dart was cast with such a mod þat þorw ys scheld it schet, Ac ys haberke was fyn &amp; god &amp; ellis he had be ded.

Roland tornd hym þanne a?eyn &amp; ys felawe dude al-so, Toward þe tour al on þe pleyn as harde as þe hors may go. Wan þe Amyral þys of-se? his herte was cast in care, To is baronage he criede an he? &amp; prayede hymen after fare: “If my neuewe goþ þus a-way by Mahoun ?e buþ to blame; Helpeþ þer-for now wat ?e may þat y ne take no schame.” Op a-sterte þe route anon &amp; hure stedes þai be-strydeþ, And as faste as þe hors may gon after hem þay rydeþ.

To þe soper þan wente þay alle þen, þe lordes, &amp; eke þe ientail wymen, And made hem murie þat ni?t. A-morwe wanne þe sonne hure schon, To-gadre þay assemblede hem euerechon, Lordes and burdes bri?t. þanne spak Richard of Normaundy To þe barons þat stode hym by: “Herknyaþ for ?our honour; Wel ?e wyteþ we buþ her enclos, Hard by-seged wyþ our foes, &amp; wyth strengþe &amp; gret vygour.” of o þyng lordes beo ous sure, Her mowe we no?t longe dure, Bot ous come socour.

Whar-for now buþ alle glad, Ri[chard] ys lyues, buþ no?t a-drad, And haþ y-don þys dede; Conquerid haþ he of kyng Claryoun, An hors þat is worþ many a toun, No-war nys such a stede.” Wanne sche haueþ hure tale y-tolde, þan gunne þaye alle waxe bolde, þat wern þo on þe tour.

By þat he hauede y-blowe a blaste, On þe toun þay bute tabours faste, &amp; made noyse horryble. To armes Sarsyns runne an haste, &amp; xx. þousant sone þer paste of þe Citee of Mantrible. þe dra?tbrigge was wel sone arered, Many a Sar?yn þar was a-stered, þat Ry[chard] wente a?ene. Now god of heuene helpe Rychard! þar mot he pace þorw þe hard, for he not wyder flene.

To ihesu þanne he bad a bone:—“Lord, þat madest sunne, mone, Lond &amp; water cler, Kep me þys day fram my fone, &amp; if y þys ryuer potte me one, þat y ne a-drenche her: &amp; such grace þow me sende, þat y may saf to Charlis wende, &amp; telle hym my porpos, So þat he may come wyþ socour, And delyuery ys barons of honour, þat liggeþ among þy fos.” Nad he no?t þat word ful speke, Er þat þar cam an hert forþ reke, As wyt ase melkys fom.

Muche hym awondreþ Charlys kyng þat he ne hureþ no tydyng of his barouns hende, hwyche he had to þe Ameral sent; For hymen ys he in gret torment, Sorwe hym gan betrende. Charlys clypede ys barouns, And scheweþ til hymen ys resons On þis manere &amp; sede: “Lordes,” said he, “me ys ful wo þat my doþþepers buþ þus a-go, y drede lest þay be dede.

By seynt Dynys a swor ys oþ, þat Gweynes &amp; hyse scholde be wroþ, for hure compassynge: “Hit ys no þyng on hymen ylong þat y ne hadde y-lost Rolond, &amp; myn barons hende. þay buþ wel ful of felonye, &amp; þat þay schullen eft-sone abye, bote þay hemen amende. y þanke þe, Ri[chard],” quaþ Char[lis] kyng, “For certis þow hauest wiþ þy tydyng y-bro?t myn herte of care.

Hyre sarplers dud he with hay be fild, &amp; bonde hem to hure sadels gyld, To deuery hure ryche araye. Hure swerdes durnely so ben y-hid, &amp; ase Marchans þat wern ounkyd, So þey wentte hure waye. Charlis takeþ wyþ hym his host, And fol?eþ after wiþ-oute bost to mantrible-ward ful ri?t. þat day ?af Richard or a ?ede To duk Rayner þe sterrede stede, þat was so god &amp; li?t. Rychard ry?d forþ wyþ ys kny?tes þat warn arayd after hure ry?tes, Ri?t as marchans scholde. By-fore þe kyng þay prykede þere, Y wol ?ow telle now what þay were, þe gretteste of þay bolde. þe furste was Richard of wham y tel, þe secunde of Nauntes þe duk Howel, Duk Rayner þ? þridde was; þe furþe was Raol of Mans þ? stronge; To seche al fraunce brod &amp; longe, A betre kny?t þer nas. þuse prykeaþ faste forþ by-fore, V. hundred kny?tis in al þay wore, Hure somers lefte þay no?t.

Saide Richard—“þat is soþ, Ac loke on þ? medwe war Sarsyn? goþ, A þousant þer buþ &amp; mo, Wel y-armed on þe beste assyse, Hure purpos y can no?t deuyse, Ne wat þay þenkþ do.” þan saide howel—“þys ys hard, Parfay ich am ful sore affard, god of heuene ous lede!” “Lordes,” quaþ Ry[chard], “buþ no?t agast, Ac holdeþ forþ ?our way an hast, &amp; boldelich doþ ?our dede: And wan we comeþ to þe brigge-gate, Hwat so þay beo þat buþ þer-ate, Doþ as y schal sayne.

Agalofre, þe voule gome, Ful wel of-se? þus kny?tes come, Wyþ hure somers fayre. Out of þe tour þan cam he doun, And set hym on an hey? peroun, y-mad as a chayre. An Axe had he þan an-honde, A shrewedere wepene for-to fonde, Was neuere non yfounde. Three fet of brede was þe blad, Of style y-tempred ful wel y-mad, þe hylue wyþ yre y-bounde. þe Sarsyn was an hudous man, By-twyne ys to browen was a span largeliche of brede; Ys browes were boþe rowe and grete, &amp; ys nose cammus, ys e?ene depe, &amp; glystryd as þ? glede. Suþþe þe werlde furst by-gan, Nas neuer ?ut so lodly man, y-mad of flehs &amp; felle. Was he no?t a godes helf þe deuel he semede al hym-self, y come þo ri?t of helle. þe Amyral hadde y-loued hym long, For he was so wonderly strong, And do?ty þer-to of dede.

Wan þay come þe Sarsyn ny Ry[chard] rod by-fore: þan Agolafre stert vp-on ys fet, And askede of Ry[chard] al so ket, Wyder-ward þat þay wore: “&amp; weþen art þou þov ladde prout?

Ri[chard] þe brigge let falle þan adoun, And hys falawes beþ entrede euerech one, or þat gret host hym come. þan come þe Sara?yns of þe Citee route, And þo?te wyþ force dryuen hem oute, &amp; þe brigge a?en vp-drawe: Ac þay wyþ-stode hem al wyþ strengþe, And reculede hem þar an acres lengþe, &amp; many þay habbeþ aslawe. Wan Charlys to þe brigge ys come, Wyþ ys hol host al and some, þe brigge þay toke a-rank. þat day Gweynes bar hym wel, And ys kynnesmen, swykel and fel, Of Char[lis] to gete hem þanke. þay were þe furste men of my?t, þat potte þe Sara?yns to þe fly?t, Al þo? þay kome late. To þe Cite ?eate þey chacedem ri?t, Ac þer þey tornde &amp; ?af hym fy?t, A litel by-fore þe ?eate. [Ry?t to þe dra?t-brigge þat lay þar-ate] Charlys gan fi?te þo wyþ egre mod, And Gweynes al-so þat bi him stod, And slo?e þe Sarsyns kete. þat day schewede þat traytour To Char[lis] ys lord ful muche honour, for neuere a nolde hym lete. Char[lis] lokedem be-hynde ys bak, And saw dele þar many a knak, &amp; myche noyse make. To þat doynge þan tornde he, What yt was he wolde y-se, &amp; þyderward he gan take. þan was Agolafre no?t ded þe ?et, Ac on his knes he hadde him set, For his legges nere no?t sonde, &amp; had wyþ ys axe a-slawe An hep of frenschemen þat leye arawe, Afforn hym on þe gronde. Char[lis] was wroþ and angry so, Wan he se? what he had do, &amp; þo?te on þis manere: “My?te þys fend aryse and go, Muche sorwe wolde he do Among my mayne here;” With þat Char[lis] to hym wond, And gurd him a strok wyþ ys brond, &amp; on þe heued him sette. Ac for þat strok had he no dere, For no strok my?t hym percy þere, þat sory skyn dude him lette: And þan was Char[lis] wonder grym, And a?eyn hym renneþ, &amp; stokeþ hym By-twene ys browes rowe: þan ran þat swerd in-to ys brayn, And whan he haueþ him so a-slayn to þe ryuer was he þrowe. Now ys Agolafre ded, &amp; Char[lis] turneþ a?e þe hed, &amp; ?ede þar he was aar. Alle þe Sar?yns þat he wyþ mette, Bytere &amp; sore he hym grette, &amp; þor? thar body hem bar. þe paynymes þat were oppon þ? brigge, þar me mi?te y-sen hem lygge, bledynge at an hepe; Summe were cloue in-to þe tonge, And somme were styked þor? lyure &amp; longe, And many wer ouer y-lepe: Sone was voydede þe brigge þere Of alle þe oþre þat lyues were, to þ? citee þaye gunne flee: þe ?eates wern opened a?en hem wyde, &amp; þay flo?e in &amp; nold no?t a-byde, &amp; sperede he[m] faste a?ee. [Boþe brigge and baly in-to þe toun-?eate, Now buþ þay comen alle þer-ate] Charlys þe Citee þo gan asayle, Two dawes hole wyþ-oute fayle, Wyþ al ys grete route: And þay wyþ-inne defended hem wel, Wyþ schutynge &amp; castyng of stones fel, Many þay slowe with-oute. Sone was. al þe contree war, xl. Myle aboute thar, þat Mantrible be-seged was, &amp; þe brygge conquered þat was stout: Sar?yn? þyder-ward þan gunne rout, to helpe hem in þat cas. Ere to dawes ful ended ware Fyfty þousant Sar?yns come thare, And entrede in þat Citee. Bot if god helpe now Charlemoun, Wel late passeþ he þor? þat toun, To helpe ys barouns fre. And nowar my?te he passe be-syde, For þe roche was he? an hundred stryde, Stondyng by þ? reuer, And anclosed þat side so stronge &amp; he?e, þat bute it were for þe foul þat fle?e, Passage was non saf þer. [þe Sar?ynen power gan waxe gret] And þe walles were of Marbreston, Wyþ pykes of yre y-set þer-on, oppon þe crest ful þykke. Muche was þe noise &amp; þat cry þat þo was maked in þat Cyty, Among þe Sar?yns wykke. þan was þar a geant ful of pryde, And openede þe water-gate wyde, Ys name was enfachoun: A mayl of Ire he bar an honde, Ther-wyþ þo?te he þanne to fonde The frensche to dynge adoun. þat heued þer-offen was wonder gret, &amp; þe hilues lengþe was viij fet of þat sturne staue.

Enfachoun ys to þe ?eate y-come, And haueþ þat mayl an-honde y-nome, &amp; at þe barers he hym sette: And sayde, “Char[lis], þou olde wrecche, Woldest þov oure relyqes fecche? By Mohoun y wol þ? lette: And bote þou þe rathere beo agon, þou schelt beo ded &amp; þat Anon. Her ri?t þou schalt baslawe.

Or Charlis tok o?t myche kepe, Of frenschemen had he slawe an hepe, þat tilde vp til ys knee: þanne come þe Sar?yn? out And defendede þ? barres al about, &amp; smyte strokes ounryde, &amp; ?yue þe frensche hard batail Ful many þar were with-oute fail; A-slawe on ayþer syde. Charlys þanne of ys stede ali?te, &amp; ioyous ys swerd out he twy?te, &amp; to þe geant sterte, And smot hym an-he? on þe pan, þat wiþ þe dynt þat swerd him ran Doun ry?t þor? ys herte; þe geant fel to grounde an haste, þan were þe Sara?yns sore agaste &amp; lefte þe barrers clene, &amp; to þe ?eate þan þay wende, And hure ?eate gunne defende, Wyþ launces &amp; gleues kene. þe power of hem enpayrede faste, &amp; þ? frensche to þam shute &amp; caste, &amp; rebuked hem foule with-ynne. þan cryede þe kyng wel an he?: “now helpeþ lordes, for we buþ ne?, our purpos her to wynne.” Wanne kyng Char[lis] had y-cryed so, Rychard and Reyner &amp; tweyne mo, Roald was on þer-ate, &amp; þe furthe was þ? duk Howelle, þat þo reculede þe Sarsyns felle, A gret way fro þe ?eate. Now habbeþ þai y-dryue hem in wyþ strengþe Wyþ-inne þe ?eate an acres lengþe, þ? kyng &amp; þys barons foure bot god now helpe þis lordes fyue In gret drede buþ þay of hure lyue, þis lordes of honoure; For þay were be-set a-boute With thre þousant at o route, fy?tyng men ful gode; And an hundred to þ? ?eate þan were y-di?t To schutten it faste bote þay ne my?t, So hard þ? frenche with-stode.

To god kyng Char[lis] prayde þo, Scholde hym saue &amp; his felawes al-so fram combryment of þo felouns, &amp; sende hym grace fayre to ascape, To do þe viage þat [he] haþ schape On helpynge of his barons. Wan duk Rychard y-herde hys fare: “Sir Emperour,” said he, “lef þy care, &amp; tak þyn herte to þe: We buþ now her foule be-sterte, Bote if we ben þe betere of herte, We buþ bot ded for soþe. Teche we now wat men we ben, For wel ?e seeþ we mo?e no?t flen; ?eld ous we mote or fi?te. &amp; ho-so þis day let take him quycke, In helle habbe he pynes wycke, Ay þer to brenne li?te.” þat confort dude Charlis god, &amp; gan to fi?te as he were wod, &amp; sone haþ sleyn a hundred. So dude þe foure as men of mod, Nas no Sarsyn þat hymen a-stod, þat nas to-hewe asounder. “Montioye!” þan Charlis gan to crye With ys voys wel an hye, þat al men mi?te yt here. Gweynes with-oute y-herde þat cry, And of ys lord þan tok pyty, Ys treytour þo? a were, &amp; hasteliche he?ede he him to þe ?eate; Ys kynrede him fol?ede &amp; stode þer-ate, A þousand ate leste; Wel harde þat ?at þay gunne assayle, And þay wiþ-inne with-oute fayle, defended hem in þ? beste, And cast out trees &amp; stones wikke, &amp; þay fulle on hur heuedes þikke, &amp; dust hem to þe erþe adoun. Wan Alorys þe traytour þat y-see?

Our kyng ys now with-inne þe walle, And Reyner of genyue, þat yuel him falle! &amp; al þat falerede. Now schulle we of hymen haue vengeaunce, Ne comeþ þay neuere no more in fraunce, bote þar þay schulle be dede. &amp; beo we delyuerd of hymen þus, y wot ful wel, be swete iesus, of þe oþre we buþ awreke, þat liggeþ at Egremoyne on þe tour; for sorwe her-of and dolour hure hertes wolleþ breke; &amp; þan mowe we wyþ-oute distaunce Habben al þe realme of fraunce At oure comaundyment.” “Godes for-bode,” Gweynes sede, “þat ich assentede to such a dede, To don hym such traysement; for þanne wer y wers þan any qued, If ich assentede to oure kynges ded, Whar þat y mi?t hym saue. for Of hym we holdeþ al our fees, We mote hym helpe in werre &amp; pees, With þe power þat we haue.” “Certis,” said Alorys, “þow dost no?[t] wel, Bote if þou do as y þe tel, &amp; herkne þenchesoun: If Char[lis] be now þar a-slawe, þe othre þanne y-worþe be don of dawe, þat liggeþ at Egrymoun; &amp; þanne buþ our enymys alle dede: &amp; þar-for lef þys assaut y-rede, &amp; turne we a?en to fraunce,” “y wil no?t,” quaþ Gweynes, “be seynt Rycher, y wol hym helpe by my power, As god me ?yue god chaunce.

Wanne þe frensche y-se?e þys, þe sege þey lefte al clene y-wys þor? hure fol distaunce. Wan sir Fyrumbras y saw þat cas A leaf of the MS. is missing here. The following note summarises the narrative as presented in the French original. Ferumbras with reproaches rallies the French, and they force their way into the city. Then the traitors join them. Mantrible is taken. A messenger takes the news to Balan. Amyote, the giantess, hearing of her husband's death, seizes a scythe, and kills several of the French. Charles with a bolt from a cross-bow kills her. The French enter the city. Now haþ Char[lis] þe citee y-take &amp; sleyn echon boþ whit &amp; blake, þat noble was &amp; feer. To dawes soiourned he &amp; two ny?te, þe Citee for to araye &amp; dy?te, After ys owe maner. Alle þay habbeþ þar-ynne aslawe þat lyued on þe heþene lawe, þat þay mo?te of-take: Muche was þe tresour þat þay founde þan, of gold &amp; syluer &amp; ryche stan, &amp; monaye whyt &amp; blake. A tour þar was of a gret Array, In whych þe Amyral ys tresour lay, Gold wyþ-oute nombre. Char[lis] hit delede wyth ys hond Among ys barons al þat a fond, Abo?en erthe and vndre. To alle men he delde ynow plentee to euery man after hys degre On þe toun and there. &amp; þanne þay so?te þe toun aboute, þay founde þe Caue þarwithoute. þar þe childrene were, Whyche þat o?te þe geauntesse, þat Char[lis] aslow in distresse, &amp; schet hure þor? þ? molde. þe chyldren þat were boþe gret &amp; tou?t, By-fore þe kynge þay were y-bro?t, to don with hem what a wolde. Wan þay come to Charlis sy?t, A blessede hym-selue anon ry?t, As he to batail scholde; &amp; sayde þanne on ys sawe, He nolde no?t þay were a-slawe, for a somers charg[e] of golde: þe kyng het anon ri?t þan, To an archebisschop þat hi?t Herman, y-folled þat þay were. þe Archebysschop fullede boþe anon, &amp; Roland þanne he het þat on, &amp; þat other Olyuere. þys was don on þe moneþ of May, Wan þe foules syngeþ on þe spray, &amp; erbes waxeþ grene: after þe ?er . þat our lord was bore, Ny?en hondred &amp; four score, þe twentyþe day y wene. þat þe toun of Mantrible conquerid was, And þe brigge y-wonne þorwe his gras. &amp; þanne þe þridde day, After þe kyng had take ys reste, Of ys barons clepede he þe beste, &amp; þus til hem gan say: “Lordes, &amp; frendes, what redeþ ?ee? Wham schal y leue þys Citee to kepe of al myn host, þe whyle y wende on my vyage To socoury myn othre baronage, þat lyþ on þe ?ondre cost?” “Sire,” quaþ Richard, “be seynt Ion, þay buþ rewarded ri?t anon, Hy þat schullaþ duelle. Roald Delamans þat on schal bee, And howel of Nauntes anoþer ys he, Certys by my wylle.” Char[lis] sayde, “by god almy?t, þow it hauest dyuysed ari?t, After myn owe lykyng. þus barouns buþ gode and suffysaunt For-to take such þyng an hant, god ?yue þ? his blessyng!” Sayde þay þanne to þe kyng: “If we her schulleþ beo leuyng, more folk moste we haue, of ?our baronage &amp; ?our gret power For-to leue wiþ ous hoer, þe Cite for-to saue.” “?e schul haue,” quaþ Charlemayn. Vij. C. he delyuerede to hem þayn, Til hem wiþ-ynne a-stonde. And eke þe wondede men al-so, To soiourny there wyþ hem tho, Til þay were hol &amp; sounde. þe Emperour þanne het an haste þat ys host were arayd faste. To wende on ys iornee. þan were þe tabours faste y-bete, As þat host him lay in euery strete of þat faire Citee. Hure harneys þay gunne to trossye þan, Baroun, &amp; kny?t, &amp; euery man: bote no?t with hem þay nadde Bot bred, &amp; wyn, &amp; flechs, and oten, þer-of þay toke as þay wer hoten, god plente þer-of þay ladde. Ac al hure harneys leuede þay þer, Cloþys, &amp; pauylouns, and oþer ger, And armedem on hure wede. And fayre þay ryde out of þe toun: Oppon blanchard rod Charloun, þat was ful god at nede. þan Char[lis] gan to loke aboute, And be-holdeþ al ys fayre route, þat spradde þo al þat cost: On ys herte god þankeþ hee, þat sent hym on erthe such postee, To gouerny such an host. “Glad,” hym þo?te, “may ich bee, Suþþen y haue al þys barnee, At my commandyment.” þan þankeþ he god eft of ys sond, &amp; croycede ys fysage with ys hond, &amp; rod forþ in þat entent. Now haþ Amyral gadrid ys host On fyftene londes of dyuers cost, To C. þousant and mo. And Charlys wyþ þe hore berde An hundred þousant hadde on herde, þanne with hym to go. Duk Richard þe Auauntwarde ladde, And Reyner of Genyue þat oþer hadde, As þ? kyng it wolde. Richard þe contree y-knew ech del, þat host he ledeþ &amp; gyeþ hit wel, þyderward þat þay scholde A Sara?yn þer was &amp; to þe Amerel ys he come &amp; telleþ þys doynge al &amp; some, &amp; saide on his resoun, In Mantryble how Charlys haþ by gunne Agolafre aslawe and wiþ strengþe y-wonne þe brygge &amp; eke þe toun. Wan þe Amyral y-herde of þat cas Almost for sorwe wod a was, &amp; wep &amp; gan to crye, And sayde, “Mahoun, þow art myswent, for now am y vndon and schent, þou art no?t worþ a flye. Wyckede god, þou dost amys, Suþþe þow wilt suffrye þys, My worschip to wyþdrawe.

Sortybran of Combles com wyþ þaat, “Let of,” sayd he, “þou oundost þy stat;” &amp; of hym þe Axe he hente. “Sire,” he said, “þow dost folye, To do Mahoun such vylonye Ase þou dadest here; For þou hauest y-schent ys face, Do makye hym betere þan a wace, &amp; amendem in þat manere.” Saide þe Amyrel, “me þenkeþ ille þat he suffreþ my worschip spille in tal þys countre wyde, &amp; suffrede Char[lis] þe brigge to pace, Mantrible to take &amp; myn men to chace, &amp; to slen hem be euery syde.” Sortybran sayde to þe Ameral þan: “Hastelyche, syre, let sende a man þat soþe for-to aspye, þat or þay ne?y to ne? þys cost þat þow mowe come wyþ þyn host, &amp; fi?te with hem an-hye. þan schal þov þy worschip gete a?e, And slen þe beste of þat meygne, &amp; take þe Emperour, &amp; lete don hym þanne an-honge, &amp; wyþ hym þus þeues stronge þat lyggeþ on þy tour. And yf Fyrumbras may be take, þat haþ ys fayþ &amp; ous for-sake, let hym þat hed for-gon. &amp; Florippe þy do?tre þat ys ounkynde, To a stake þan let hure bynde, And bren hure þanne anon.” þan þe Amyral hym vnderstod þat ilke consayl þo?t hym god, &amp; saide it scholde be don. Toward Mahoun he humblede him þan, And after þe conseyl of Sortybran An aspye he sent anon. To þe A[myral] Sortibran þo cam &amp; sede “Let assembly þyn host, y rede, ?ond be-fore þe tour; &amp; we schul fonde wyþ strengþe &amp; gyne, If we mowe þe tour y-wynne, or þaym come socour.

Sortybrant confortede him þan, And bad hym stonde vp as a man, &amp; lete of care and wo. Tho was þe assaut y-leuyd clene, for þe Amyral was so fol of tene, And ne mi?t no?t tendy þer-to. “Ay Mahoun,” quaþ þe A[myral] “whar ys þy my?t? Why wolt þou suffry þys ounri?t, þat þay doþ þe þis day? þyne fon me schendeþ &amp; þe al-so, And þou ne takest no kepe þer-to, þy mi?te ys al away.” þan hym spak syre Sortybrant: “Wyt þat þe selue, syr Amyrant, y schal þe saye why: Bred &amp; wyn, &amp; corn plentee, &amp; gold, &amp; syluer haþ he send þe, lordlyche to lyue þar-by; Ac þou hym hauest foule myssayd, Whar-for he ne ys no?t wel apayd, of þyng þat he þ? ?af.

An hard assaut þo by-gan, non scherpere y-saw þer neuere man, y-mad of flesche &amp; bon. Hure grete engyns þan þay bende, And grete stones þar-wyþ þay sende to þe he?e tour: þe walles to-breke, &amp; al to-crusschede, Oueral þar þe stones dusschede, comynge with vygour: Mynours ?ude &amp; mynede þe wal, þe he?e tour to maky hym fal, &amp; summe laddres bere, &amp; aboute þe wal þe laddres lede. God of heuene þe barouns spede! In gret peril þan þay were. þe assaut was huge and perillous, And þe cry oryble and hydous, þat þe Sar?yns made.

Ac þys barons of gret honour A?eyn hem buþ ynome; With swerdes &amp; axes scherp y-grounde þay affuldem with deþes wonde, þar-to were þay boun: Ech on oþer þan gan doun falle, &amp; breke hure nekkes to peces smalle, So dupe þay fulle adoun. “Lordes,” sayde þanne þe gode Ogyer, “We ne buþ bot ten alone heer, to defendye al þis flette: Ac of al fraunce her ys þe flour, Do we þat no man in deshonour of cowardyse ous mo?e arette. By-holdeþ þys tour, þat er strong was, To-broken ys now in twenty plas, wyþ gonnes &amp; cast of gynne. Ac by hym þat flechs of Marie tok, þe wyle þat lyf syt on my bok, ne comeþ þer none with-inne: þe whyle y may wylde with myn hond Corteyn my swerd, þat gode brond, so Sarsyns schal y so cloute, þat a cartful y schal sle me-self; And doþ ?e al-so on ?oure be-helf, &amp; holde we hymen with-oute.” Ro[land] ys swerd þan gan be-holde, And Olyuer hys þat was so bolde, þat boþe blody ware. þan was þar non of al þe wacche þat ys herte ne by-gan to cacche, &amp; to fi?te mad hem ?eare. By þat were Sara?yns sto?en vp al frechs, And wer come inward at hard &amp; neychs At a pan þat was broken; Ac þys lordes hymen potte a-gayn, And habbeþ hem sone fylled &amp; slayn &amp; þat hole a?ayn y-stoken. “A lord,” sayde Florippe þan, “Sone worth ych a lost womman, Wel ne? þe tour ys take. Wo worth þe tyme he was arerd, Of my deth y am afferd, Lordes, for ?our sake.” Gwy of Borgoygne sayde þan: “Ne say þou so no more, lemman, Y pray þe for þyn honour.” “Syre,” sche saide, “y drede stronge For we dwelleþ her so longe, &amp; þar compþ ous no socour. Y hopede lemman, by my lyf, To han y-beo þy weddid wyf, &amp; be cristned for þy sake. þan scholdest þow of al þis lond be kyng, And y þy quene, my swete þyng, &amp; þy worldy make.” Tharwyth sche made a long sykyng, And hadde þan y-falle in sowenyng, Nad olyuer hure vp y-take. þan was non þat mornynge nas Wanne þay hurde þat fayre of fas, How dulfully sche spake. Duk Naymes þo gan loky out, &amp; saw comyng þ? grete rout of Charl[is] with his host On a mounteyne wyþ gret bobance; þe baner knew he ful wel of fraunce þat drowe toward þat cost. “lordlynges,” sayde Naymes þan, “bliþe beþ &amp; glade euery man, &amp; lustneþ god tydynge: þat host of fraunce y seo her come Ful wel y haue it vndernome, be þe baner þat y seo brynge. þe baner ys yborn be-fore þe ferde, &amp; þat host hym cometh afterwerde, Al armed on armes bri?te. þay spedeþ faste on hure maner, Wel fayne þay wolde þat þay wer her, yt semeþ me be sy?te.

Char[lis] and ys host come þay se?e, þe baner of france y-bore an-he?e, þan waxen hy ful bolde. To þe A[merel] þe aspye a?en ys went, Of wam y tolde þat was y-sent To aspyen how it ware, And telleþ hym how þat Charlemayn Wyþ ys host hym comeþ agayn With hym to fi?te ?eare. þanne hym askede þe Amerel: “Wyþ how many comeþ þe fauterel Wyþ þe hore berde?” “Sir,” quaþ he, “þar buþ y-tolde An hondred þousand of kny?tes bolde Comyng on ys ferde.” Sorty brant sayde, “þer-of no drede, þow hast þe doble on þy ferede, Ay tweyne a?en hem one, And þay habbeþ þe wrong &amp; we þe ri?t; To-morwe we schulle wyþ hym fi?t, &amp; discomfytye hymen echone.” Charlys rod forth wyþ ys host, Til he cam negh? þe cost, Thar þe Ameral lay; &amp; wanne a saw ys pauyllouns Abide bad he hys barouns, No ferþer nolde he þat day. The ny?t was come, þe day was gon, þe Emperour him li?t a-doun anon, Vnder an Aychs y wene, þat stod þe same playn oppon, þer þat þe Amerel his host lay on, y-loged on a grene. Thar herborghede þe kyng &amp; ys barouns, Wyþ-oute tentes oþer pauyllouns, Al þat ilke ny?te. For at Mantrible þay hadde y-laft Tentes, pauyllons, &amp; al þat craft, þat þer-to scholde be di?te. Ne dude no man þar of ys gere, Bot al ny?t leyen y-armed ther On armes of god entaile. Hure stedes þai fedde with otes &amp; bred, &amp; hym-self dronke whit wyn &amp; red, &amp; eten of hure vytaile. On þe mor?nyng wan þe day him sprong, Charlis ?eode ys host among, &amp; het þay scholden di?te, Boþe man &amp; hors on such aray As þay wende at al asay beo syker ynow to fi?te; &amp; þan behuld he aboute þe plas, &amp; clepede til him sire Fyrumbras, &amp; þus he spak him tille:— “Fyrumbras, y loue þe for-þan þat þou art bycome a criste-man by þy gode wille: Wolde þy fader cristendom take y Wolde him kepe for þy sake, lost-les on euery syde: Harm ne schold he haue non, On body ne catel, by seynt ion, for al þe worlde wyde, Notheles he haueþ y-do me wrong, My messagers i-holde in prysoun strong, þat y sent hym yore; Ro[land] and othere þat buþ me luf; &amp; þo? y now do hym gref, Beo no?t wroþ þerfore.” þanne hym ansuerede Sir Fyrumbras: “Send to my fader in þys cas, Ys wille to wyte &amp; knowe, If he wolde assenty þar-to; Leuere me were hit my?t be so, þan al þat god y owe.” “Y grante wel,” quaþ þ? Emperer; With þat he clypede duk Reyner, &amp; Rychard of Normaundye, And askede of hem wham þay wil rede þat he schold sende on þat nede, To þe Amerel of nubbye: “If ?e lordes willeþ assenty þar-to, Gweynes schal myn eraunt do, for he ys fers and fel; At þe takyng of Mantrible toun He bar hym as a bold baroun, &amp; prouede him þar ful wel.” Gweynes iherde þe kynges sawe, And sayde a wolde wende fawe, &amp; perfornye wel þat nede: &amp; þaye assentede on hym ?eare þat Gwenes schudde to Ameral fare, þat erand for-to bede. To hym þanne saide þe kyng of fraunce: “Arme þe wel for alle chaunce, þyderward er þou wende; For þo? þe Amyral be our fo, Til hym þe message þou most do, þat y schal þe sende. Say hym þat he his lay for-sake, &amp; to cristendom him-silue take, &amp; lyue on god Almi?te; &amp; þat he delyuery me my barouns bolde þat he haþ kept on ys holde, long tyme a?e þe ri?te, And delyuery me vp on god aray þe Relyqes þat he bar away, In Rome my Citee gret; þe nayles three, &amp; þe croune, þat perschede cryst on ys passyoune, On hefd, honde, and fet: And if he wil assenty þar-to, non harm þanne ne wyl y do To hym ne non of hys. And yf a wil no?t as god me saue, Vengeaunce of hym wil y haue, &amp; loke þou say hym thys.” To Charlis þanne saide Gweneloun: “þy message schal be wel y-don, Sone with-oute drecche.” Ys helm on is hed sone he caste, And let him lacye wel &amp; faste, &amp; ys swerd me dude hym fecche. A lep vp þanne on ys hors of werre, And takeþ til hym scheld &amp; sperre, Strong &amp; god at nede. Oþer felaschip ne takeþ he non, Bot rydeþ forþ hym-self al-on, To do þat hardy dede. As Gweynes hym prikede ouer þ? feldes, He meteþ Sarsyns with speres &amp; scheldes, þat kepte þ? wacche þan: þay askede of hem þanne an-haste, Why he prykede so wonder faste, &amp; wyder he þo?te gan. “Y am a Messager,” quaþ Gweneloun, “Y-send to þe A[meral] by Charloun;” &amp; þanne þay lete hym fare. Neuere ne astente he after þan, Bote prykeþ hym forth be-fore Balan, yn-to ys pauylloun ?eare. Gweynes was boþe hardy &amp; wys, To þe Ameral spak he his avys, ne sparede he for no doute. “Balan,” said he, “to me entende. Charlis kyng to þe me sende, to wham þou most aloute. Mahoun he hoteþ þat þow for-sake, And anon ri?t to follo?t take, &amp; by-lyue on god almi?te. Ys barons als þou scholdist him ?elde, And þe relyqes þat þou dost helde, Al agayn þe ri?te. &amp; if þou assentist to þys sonde, He ne wol no þyng of þy londe, bote lete þe in pes &amp; reste; &amp; euere he wol the worschip do, &amp; Fyrumbras þy sone wol al-so, þe wyle ys lyf wil leste. &amp; bot þou her-of make þy fyn, He diffieþ þe and alle þyn, for with þe wil he fi?te, &amp; discoumfity þe her &amp; þy ferede, &amp; putte þy body to schentful dede, for þy grete onri?te.” Wanne þe Ameral hym vnderstod, A clew ys heued, and ri?te ys hod, &amp; starede with ys e?ene wronge, &amp; prauncede &amp; blew as he were wod, &amp; mi?t no?t speke for his he?e mod, or was after longe. And þan saide he to Gweneylloun: “How wer þou so hardy, stronge feloun, come armed on þy stede, By-fore me her on my pauylloun, &amp; þus vylayn[i]che on þy resoun þy message to me abede? By Mahoun, on wham my be-lyue ys an, þou ne comest neuere,” saide Balan, “to Charlemayn a?ene.” To his barouns þan cride he loud—“To-heweþ þes messager þat ys so proud, Wyþ swerdes scherpe &amp; kene.” Gweynes þanne hym gan to doute, Wanne he saw to hym-ward route Sara?yns stronge &amp; smerte; A drow ys swerd &amp; smot Bruyllant, þat was kyng of Mountmyrrant, euene in-to þe herte; þe Sara?yn þat was of gret renoun At þe Amyral is fet hym fel adoun; &amp; Gweynes turnde hym þanne, And rod out of þe pauylloun þorw al þat host with gret rendoun, As faste as he may renne. þe Amyral ran after hym on ys fet, And cryde to ys host with herte gret— “Takeþ þan þef an-haste.” To horse þanne wente at o trome Fyfty þousant of armede gome, &amp; after hym prykede vaste. At a wyndowe of þe tour stod Neymoun, And saw how þay enchacede Gweneloun, To slen him if þay my?te; Ro[land] þan clypeþ he &amp; Olyuer: “Sirs,” quaþ Neymes, “comeþ ner, And seeþ a propre si?te; Fro þe ?ond pauyllons prykeþ a kny?t, An-horse, y-armed, &amp; weel y-dy?t, Wyþ a drawe swerd an-honde; &amp; hym chacyeþ Sarsyns, by god almi?t, Wel fifty þousant y-armed bri?t, To slen him doþ þay fonde. Me symeþ it ys a Messageer, And Gweynes hit semeþ be si?te her, þat rideþ þar al-one.” “Parfay,” quaþ Ro[land], “þow saist þat soþe, þat knowe hym wel &amp; ys stede boþe, god kep hym fram ys fone!” Alle þay gunne þan god to praye, þat scholde hym coundye on ys waye, &amp; saflyche a?en hym sende. Ac for þay wern for hym in doute, þey by-hulden him ?erne &amp; lokede oute. Wyte þay wolde þan ende Forth hym prykeþ sir Gweneloun Opon ys stede Chacebroun, To-ward ys strengþ? an hye; And þe Sara?yn? after him prikede . þanne Ase harde as hure hors mi?t renne, With noyse &amp; eke with crye, Gweynes fle? forþ so wynd and rayn Til he cam ne? amydde þe playn, &amp; wi?tliche he turnd him þanne, And smot a Sarsyn of Agrymoun, þor? ys hed he clef hym doun, In-to ys brest a spanne. Wyþ tenebre he meteþ &amp; suþþe anoþer, þat on was cosyn, þat oþer was brother To þe Amyral Balanne. Tenebre gurde he þor? þe brayn, þat oþer in þe herte with mi?t &amp; mayn, And forþ he prykeþ þanne. Gweynes was boþ strong and feer, And ofte he tornde hym in þis maner, &amp; slow al þat he ra?te. &amp; eft he prikede on ys way, And wan Ol[yuer] þat al þys cas y-say Y-saw how wel he fa?te, To Roland said he þanne ry?t: “How þeynt þe, felawe, be þis kny?t þat berþ hym þus wel al-one? Ne saw y neuere o man with my sy?t, Saf þe bere hym betere in fy?t, by god þat sit in trone. Now wold it god on þys nede, þat y were by hym on my stede, Baucyn of Melaunt. þan schold y make hure sydes blede, An hundred of hem þer scholde be dede, Of Sarsyns &amp; persaunt.” Of hys do?tynisse myche þay speke, Ac euere þe Sara?yns after hym reke, To slen hym was hure mod: Ac wan þay þat frensch host of-seyn, þay wern agast &amp; tornde a?eyn, prykynge as þay were wod: To þe Ameral þay come sone þas, &amp; tolde þat soþe how it was, of þ?

For Char[lis] þay saiden scholde be slawe, And Fyrumbras ys sone an-honged &amp; drawe, &amp; Flo[rippe]schold be for-brent, And Char[lis] host discoumfyted &amp; slayn; Thus þay talkede be-twene hem tweyn, As þay to-gadre went. Wanne hire hostes were to-gadre y-come, þanne was ther an huge trome, iij hundred þousent &amp; mo.

Now ys Gweynes come a?eyn, &amp; telleþ ys lord, kyng Charlemeyn, to-gadre betre &amp; werse, þat þe Amerel ne dredeþ hym no?t, Nouþer in dede ne in þo?t, þe value of a kerse. &amp; þat wanne he spak of crystendom, How he spatte &amp; fyede þar-on, &amp; wolde hym hab y-sleyne.

For in-to Aufryke schal he be lad, Wyþ þe oþre þat me habbeþ sory mad, þat liggeþ her on my tour.” þay ensemblede þanne to-gadre anon, þe Sarsyns blewe hure hornes ecchon, to batail or þay paste. Ac by-fore alle prikede Bruyllant, For prude &amp; for-to make auaunt, Wel a stones caste; And þanne he cryde and gan to sayn: “Whar art þow, Char[lis], þow vylayn? Wat dost þov yn þis lond.

On þe morwe wan þe sonne schon, Char[lis] of-sente ys barons ecchon, And among hem departeþ þanne Of þat gold &amp; of þat gery?oun þat he fond on þe tour &amp; on þe toun, Y-now to euery manne. An Archebysschop he clepede after þaat, And bad hym ordeyne an huge vaat, Ful of water clere; And his orysouns saye oppon, As he wolde fully ther-on þan Amyral þat was þere. þe Bysschop wente aboute sone þe kynges heste for-to done, for þat hym þo?te god; &amp; wan he had al aboute y-so?t, To a gret holw marbre was he bro?t, þat wyþ-ynne þe paleys stod; Whych was wonyd beo fillid wyþ wyn At euerech gret feste of appolyn, þat þ?

And suþþe of-sente he after þan After þe Ameral, syre Balan, be barons threo wel wy?te, Roland, Olyuer, and Ogyer; þilke thre þo fette hym ther, &amp; bro?t hym forþ anon, by-fore þe emperour þat hym abod And he het anon þar as he stod, Dispoily hym by-fore þe ston. Wan þay by-gunne ys cloþys of-do Myche strif made þe Amerel tho, And tornde &amp; wende faste, Ac Roland and Olyuer hulde hym so, That whather he wolde oþer no, ys cloþys of thay caste. þe Emperour sayde to hym þan—“þou schalt ben a crysteman, &amp; ben y-follyd here; And if þou wolt þer-to beo bro?t, Of þyne ne schalt þow lese no?t, þe worthy of a pere: Ac arst þou most for-sake Mahone, And be-lyue on gode sone, þat in marye y-kened was; &amp; suþþe of hure body y-bore, Wyþ-oute wem &amp; wyþ-oute hore, As sunne goþ þor? þ? glas. þow most al-so be-lyue thus, þat he suffrede deþ for vs, To kepe ous fram helle pyne; &amp; þat he a-ros þe þridde day, And to helle tok þo þe way, And delyuerede þar is hyne; And þat he þer-after to heuene ste?, &amp; syt on ys fader ri?t hond an-he?, &amp; ys in trynytee: And suþþe sente þe holy gost To ys decyples he louede most, And het men y-fulled bee: þou most byleue on holychurche, After hure lawe for-to wurche, And on for-?yft of synne; And on þe dredful domes-day, Wan ech man schal rysen on such aray As he dayeþ ynne, And come be-fore god present, And fonge ther ys iuggyment, to ioye oþer pyne to wende, After þat þat hy doþ heere, Body &amp; saule to dwelle y-fere, Euere wyþ-outen ende, Bylyf þou as y haue þe tau?t, And on þys water tak fullau?t, &amp; þys schal beo þy mede; þy body and þy catel þan my?t þou saue, And heuene blisse al-so haue, If þou dost þat dede.” Wan þe Amerel haþ iherd hym telle, Contenance made he fers &amp; felle, &amp; fram hym tornde away: And bytok hym-selue þe deuel of helle, If he wolde euere wyþ follo?t melle, Terme of ys lyues day; Ne Mahoun wolde he neuere for-sake, For drede of deþ ne for þe wrake, to be ded þer for þe ri?te. For Angre sake þanne he swatte, &amp; þan ston a cracchede &amp; in a spatte In dispit of god almy?te. Wan þe Emperour y-hurd him speke so, Wonderly wroþ þan wax he þo, Ys swerd þan gan he dra?e; Ne hadde Fyrumbras ys sone y-ben þat þo wente hem be-twen, A wold him haue a-sla?e. Fyrumbras huld þan Emp[er]our, And prayede him cesse of his rauncour, &amp; he wolde eft asaye, If he mi?te wyþ any colour Brynge him ?ut of his errour, In-to þe betere waye. þanne spak Florippe, þat burde bry?t—“Syr Emperour, þov dost no?t ary?t, To tarye þus for ys sake. ?e hadde don wel, by god almy?t, Had ?e do slen him ?esterny?t, Wan þat he was take.” þe Emperour huld ys swerd an-honde, And askede a?en whar he wil fonde to lyue on cristes lay, And Mahon ys false god for-sake, And crystendom þar by-fore hym take Wyþ-oute more delay: &amp; if a wolde, þat hit were so, A wolde be ys frend for euere-mo, On what lond þat he lende; And þat he nel by-nyme hym lond ne fee, Bot euere scholde beo to hym pryuee, In-to ys lyues ende. þan Fyrum[bras] ys sonne hym sette on knen By-fore ys fader &amp; cryede a?en— “Mercy, fader,” he sayde, “Swete fader, do hys lykyng, And ne make þer-of no more taryyng, for gode loue y pray þe. And þan my?tou haue al þyn Awe, And libbe þy lyf on godes lawe &amp; kepe þe so fro sore; And þilke þat buþ now þyn fon Wolleþ þe louye euerechon, &amp; worschypy þe euere-more.” “Y graunte,” quaþ he þan “haue y-saied How þat þys water ys arayed, þat y schal plungy on.” þan was Fyrumbras glad &amp; blythe, And þankede god ful many a sythe, &amp; bro?te hym to þe ston, Charlis þanne hym wax ful glad, And hopede a wolde be christen mad, So wern þe oþre barouns. þe bysschop stod þer þo þat had Y-blessed þe fant, and ouer y-rad Alle ys orysouns. þe bysschop sayde to þe Ameral þan—“If þou wilt ben a crysteman, Mahoun þou most for-sake, Aller-ferst by-fore ous here, And suþþe stape in-to þis water clere, þan schaltou fullo?t take.” þe A[meral] þan wroþeliche hym gan beholde, And gurde hym with ys fuste y-volde, Ageyn ys cheke an-haste, þat þre teþ sterte out of þe bon, &amp; nadde Ogyer þo by-twene hem gon, He wolde him habbe of-þraste. þanne saide þe Ameral with egre mod—“Wat wenestow, glotoun, þat ich be wod, Schold y for-sake my dri?te, And beo plunged on þys marbre ston?” In dispyt of cryst þan spat he þer-on, by-fore hure Aldre sy?te. þo wax Charlys wonder grym, And clepede Fyrum[bras] &amp; spak to hym, In þ? maner as y schal sayne:— “Fyrumbras, as þow art me lef, Ne tak yt no?t to no gref, þo? y putte hym to is peyne, Suþþe he wil no?t christened be, Bot haþ now in dispyt of me My bysshop y-bete sore: And afterward, in þe dyspyt of crysst, Spet on þe fant as þow her sysst, ne pray þow for hym no more.” Wan Fyrumbras herd hym speke so, For ys fader þanne hym was so wo He nyste wat þo to done: Bote by-fore hym on ys knes a cryde þat a wolde ?ut a-byde Wyþ hym til eft-sone, þat he hym hadde eft by-so?t, &amp; bot if he þanne wold take fullo?t, As he hym wolde abette, Hys wille wyþ hym do a scholde &amp; gurde of his heued ?yf a wolde, No lenger wold he him lette. To þe Emperour saide florippe þan—“Wy tariest þou so longe wyþ þat man, þat haþ þe &amp; þyne agreued? Al ys for no?t ?e A-boute goes, ?e ne bringeþ him neuere to ?oure purpos, y leye þer-to myn heued.” Til hure þan saide sir Fyrumbras—“Sustre ne ys he þy fader; alas!

Wyþ wilde hors mot y beo drawe, Bot y wolde her ri?t fawe A lyme of me for-gon, Wyþ þat he y-folled wolde bee On þat water þat here [?e] see standyng her on þys ston.” Wyþ þat he wep &amp; sy?te sore, As he þanne stod hym by-fore, &amp; þus til hym gan telle— “Swete fader, chaunge þy þo?t, And elles þow worst to deþe y-bro?t, þan goþ þy saul to helle. And if þow wolt be y-fulled heer þar-of þanne ert þow . skeer, &amp; heuene my?t þou craue. And leue lordlich on þyn owe, And habbe at þyn heste he?e &amp; lowe, As þou wer woned to haue.

To kyng Charlys sayde he þan—“Doþ now syre by thys man As it is þy wille; Certys y ne haue now no wonder þo? ?e hym do hewe ech lyme on sonder, þor?-out flechs &amp; bon, Suþþe he wil no?t for no pray Belyue on god &amp; for-sake ys lay Ne follo?t take non.” þan Char[lis] askede of ys men a-boute, Hwych of hem wolde of al þe route Sle þat heþene hounde. Ogyer hym ansuerede—“y wil hym slo, For myche tene he haueþ me y-do, Her ys his bane y-founde.” Ys swerd a drow þat het corteyn, Wel many a Sara?yn had he sleyn thar-with thar by-fore. Ogier in the nekke thar-wyþ hym gerte, þat þe heued fro þat body sterte, ys owen lengþe &amp; more. Wan þe A[meral] Balan was a-slawe Florippe com forþ &amp; was wel fawe, &amp; [. . asked(?)] kyng Charloun, &amp; sayde, “syre kyng, as þou art wi?te, And y haue ben trewe to þyne kni?te(?), [Now] graunte to me Gyoun.” “Damesele,” quaþ Roland, “þow sayst ry?t, þow schalt hym haue by god almy?t.” þan spak he to þat hende— “Gy of Borgoygne, do as þow hy?t, Ant tak þys lady fair &amp; bri?t, In-to þy lyues ende.” “Wel gladlych,” saide Gyoun þo, “So þat myn vncle assenty to, þe Emperour Charlemayn.” þan saide Charlys—“god for-beode þat y anentes þilke neode Any-þyng sayde a-gayne.” þe Damesele dispoilled hure þanne anon, Hyr skyn was as whyt so þe melkis fom, fairer was non on molde: Wyþ e?ene graye, and browes bent, And ?ealwe traces, &amp; fayre y-trent, Ech her semede of gold. Hure vysage was fair &amp; tretys, Hure body iantil and pure fetys, &amp; semblych of stature. In al þe werld ne mi?t be non fayrer wymman of flesch &amp; bon, þan was þat creature. Wan þys lordes had sey?en hur naked, In alle manere wyse weel y-maked, On hure þay toke lekynge. Was non of hem þat ys flechs ne-raas, Noþer kyng, ne baroun, ne non þat was, Sche was so fair a þynge. The remainder of the MS. is missing. The following note provides a summary of the narrative as presented in the French original. Floripas is baptised, but her name is not changed. She and Guy are crowned, and Spain is divided between Guy and Ferumbras. At the end of a month Charles prepares to return to France. He asks Floripas to show him the sacred relics, as he intends to start the next day. Floripas produces the casket: the crown of thorns is exhibited to the barons. The archbishop tests it, by leaving it suspended in the air without any support. A delicious odour comes from it. The archbishop takes out the nails. The archbishop tests the nails, and declares them to be the real relics. Then he draws out the inscription, which he shows, and lays on a cloth beside the other relics. The relics are carefully wrapped up and placed in the king's coffer. Charles places the fragments of the thorns in his glove, which remains suspended in the air for over an hour. The archbishop points out this great miracle. Charles and his barons go to dinner. The revelry lasts till nightfall, when they separate. Charles dreams that he is at Aixla-Chapelle, and a voice bids him return to Spain, to help Guy. And that a favourite lioness tries to tear him to pieces. Naymes explains the meaning of the dream. Next morning after mass the army starts. Floripas accompanies them a short distance. Guy and Ferumbras go as far as Mantrible, where Charles stays one night. Guy and Ferumbras take leave of Charles. On the eighth day the French arrive at Paris. Charles goes to St Denis and exhibits the sacred relics, which he distributes: part of the crown and one nail he gives to St Denis: the inscription to Compiegne. He establishes in their honour the fair of ‘Lendit.’ Within three years came the treachery of Gwenelon and the death of Roland. Gwenelon is torn in pieces. My tale is done, God bless you all!</field>
