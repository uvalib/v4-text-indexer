      <field name="fulltext">The entertaynemente of the Queenes Maiestie into Suffolke, and Norffolke. To the righte worshipfull Maister Gilbert Gerrard, the Queenes Maiesties Attourney Generall, Thomas Churchyard Gent. sendeth this signe of good will, and wisheth encrease of worthy fame. The Song on Saturday at hir Highnesse entrie, soong on the great Stage that was next the Market place, by the Waytes and best voyces in the Citie. The deaw of heauen droppes this day on dry and barren ground, Wherefore let frutefull heartes I saye at Drumme and Trumpet sound Yeelde that is due, shew that is meete, to make our ioy the more, In our good hope, and hir great prayse, we neuer saw before. The Sunne doth shine where shade hath bin, long darkenesse brought vs day, The Starre of comfort now coms in, and heere a while will stay. Ring out the belles, plucke vp your sprightes, and dresse your houses gay, Runne in for floures to straw the streetes, and make what ioy you may. The deaw of Heauen. &amp;c. Full many a Winter haue we seene, and many stormes withall, Since heere we saw a King or Queene in pomp and Princely pall. Wherefore make feast, and banket still, and now to triumph fall, With dutie let vs shew good will, to gladde both great and small. The deaw of Heauen. &amp;c. The Realme throughout will ring of this, and sundry Regions moe Will say, full great our fortune is, when our good hap they knoe. O Norwich, heere the well spring runnes, whose vertue still doth floe, And loe this day doth shine two Sunnes within thy walles also. The deaw of Heauen. &amp;c. The Boyes speech at Maister Peckes dore. Great things were meant to welcome thee (ô Queene,) If want of time had not cut off the same: Great was our wish, but small is that was seene, For vs to shew, before so great a Dame. Great hope we haue it pleasd our Princes eye, Great were the harmes that else our paynes should reape: Our grace or foyle, doth in your iudgement lie, If you mislike, our griefes do grow on heape: If for small things, we do great fauour find, Great is the ioy, that Norwich feeles this day: If well we waid the greatnesse of your mind, Few words would serue, we had but small to say. But knowing that your goodnesse takes things well That well are meant, we boldly did proceede: And so good Queene, both welcome and farewell, Thine owne we are, in heart, in word, and deede. Mondayes Deuice. The manner of Mercuries Coatche and message to the Queene, requesting hir Highnesse to come abroade, and see what pastyme the Gods had prouided for a noble Prince. Mercuries speech. Mvse not good Queene at me that message brings From Ioue, or iust Iehoua, Lord of might, No earthly God, yet gouernes mortall things, And sprites diuine, and shining Angels bright. This Lord of late to shew his mightie power, Hath wonders wrought, when world lookt least therefore: For at his becke, this day, and present houre, The Heauens shakt, the thunder boltes did rore. The earth did mooue, the dead therein did rise, And out of graue, the Ghostes of men are gone, The wandring Sprites that houered in the Skyes Dropt downe from ayre, for world to wonder on. The Sainctes themselues, that sate in glory great, Were sent in hast, to worke Iehouas will, And I that oft my restlesse wings do beate, Was cald, to vse my wings and office still. A common post is Mercury you know, When he commaunds that made the world of nought, And flyes as fast, as arrow out of bowe, When message may expresse Iehouas thought. Whose power deuine full long ere this hath seene, That in this place should lodge a sacred Queene. And waying well, the Prince whereof I speake, Might weerie waxe of common pastimes heere, (For that he knowes hir iudgement is not weake,) Deuisd aboue, below there should appeare (To welcome hir) some sights that rare should seeme, And carelesse stoode, what world thereof did deeme: So that good Queene, you take them well in worth. No sooner had Iehoua meant these things, But Cloudes clapt hands, and soules of men came foorth Of Heauen gates, yea goodly crowned Kings Were flowen abroade, from blessed Abrams brest: Some in the ayre, and toppes of trees did rest, Some fell on Toures, and stately houses high, Some suncke in Seas, whose names were drouned now, And some did light on land where euery eye May them behold, and note their manners throw. And there withall, the blacke infernall spreetes Ranne out of Hell, the earth so trembling than, And like yong laddes they hopt about the streetes. The Satyres wilde, in forme and shape of man Crept through the wooddes, and thickets full of breeres, The water Nymphes, and Feyries streight appeares In vncouth formes, and fashion strange to view: The hagges of Hell that hatefull are of kind, To please the time, had learnd a nature new, And all those things that man can call to mind, Were gladde to come, and do their dutie throwe. I seeing this, cald for my Coatch in hast, Abide sir Boy, then sayd Iehoua now, Thou goest not yet, vntill a Prince be plast Where I appoynt, thou hast nothing to say. Then still I stoode, to know what should be done. With that, a swarme of people euery way Like little Antes, about the fields gan runne, Some to prouide for pomp and triumph great, Some for good fare, yea household cates and meate, And some they ranne to seeke where Poets dwell, To penne foorth shewes, and paint out trifles well. Some halde and puld, to bring the carredge in, Some ranne to gaze on triumph neere at hand, And some stoode mute, as they amazde had bin To see a Court, and Princely noble band Come marching on, and make heere their abode: But when I saw the carredge heere vnlode, And well had wayd the wonders I haue tolde, O mighty God (quoth I) now giue me leaue To goe from thee, some message to vnfold, That by my speech the hearers may conceiue Thy Godhead great, hath brought this Princesse here. It shall be so (quoth he) dispatch and part, And tell hir, that she is to me so deere, That I appoynt by mans deuice and arte, That euery day she shall see sundrie shoes, If that she please to walke and take the ayre: And that so soone as out of dore she goes (If time do serue, and weather waxeth fayre) Some odde deuice shall meete hir highnesse streight, To make hir smyle, and ease hir burthened brest, And take away the cares and things of weight That Princes feele, that findeth greatest rest. When I had thus receyvd my charge at full, My golden rodde in liuely hand I tooke, And badde in hast my flying Horses pull. But eare I past, I gan about me looke To see that Coatch, and each thing gallant were: So downe I came, all winged as you see. And since I haue espyde that Princesse there, That greatest Kings do sue to by degree, And many mo that sues no whit, do feare, I kisse hir steppes, and shew my maisters will, And leaue with hir such graces from aboue, As alwayes shall commaund hir peoples loue, (Vphold hir raigne, maynteyne hir regall state, Find out false harts, and make of subiectes true, Plant perfite peace, and roote vp all debate) So with this grace, good Queene now heere adue, For I may now on earth no longer stey, Than Seruants must to Maisters will obey. Tuesdayes Deuice. Cupid comming, as he reportes, out of Heauen (from whence his Mother and he is banished) encountres the Queene, and speaketh as followeth, he riding in a Coatch: and you must presuppose, that before his comming to the Queene, he and hys Mother had mette with the Philosopher. [Alas poore boy, where shalt thou wander now] The Shew of Chastitie. Alas poore boy, where shalt thou wander now, I am thrust out of Heauen in despight, My Mother too beginnes to bend the brow, For both we walke, as we were banisht quite. She mourne, and weepes, and blubbers like a child, By which great griefe, in rage now may she fall, And I haue leaue to walke the wood so wild, To houle, to crye, and sore complayne withall. For loe of late, where she and I did goe, A man we met, a father graue and wise, Who told vs both (if you the troth will know) We were the drosse, the scumme of earth and Skyes Fond paltry Gods, the sincke of sinne and shame, A leawd delight, a flying fansie light, A shadow fond, that beares no shape, but name. The whole abuse of each good witte or wight, An ydle ground, whereon vayne Poets walke, A cause of eare, a spring where follie sloes A wicked meane, to nourish wanton talke, And to conclude, sharp nettles vnder Rose We were: thus sayd the Father that we met. My Mother blusht, these thundering words to heare, And from them both, away in hast I get, To see if I in Court find better cheere, But if no friend, nor fauoure I may finde, Nor aunswere haue of that which heere I speake, Farewell, I seeke my fortune in the wind, For Cupid hath in head a finer freake. If Heauens high disdeyne to giue me place In earth below, I meane to hide my face. Chastitie suddainely in the view of the Queene, settes vpon Cupid, and spoyles hym of his Coatch, Bowe and all, and sets him a foote, Musicke the mean tyme. and so rides in his Coatche to the Queene, and speakes as followeth. Chastitie speaketh. To striue with boyes that standes on bragges and braues I thought great scorne, till Cupid I espyde, But that proude ladde, that makes so many slaues, Must needes find one, to daunt his Peacocks pride. Dame Chastitie is she that winnes the field, Whose breast is armd with thoughtes of vertues rare, Who to the fight doth bring no glittering shield, But cleane conceytes, which pure and blessed are, That strikes downe lust, and tames the wilfull mind, Maynteynes the iust, and holds vp learning both; And wisedome great, through me the Sages find, Philosophers, the louers of the troth. Yea Kings and Queenes by me worke wonders still, Do conquere Realmes, and Wisedome do attayne. The studious minds, whose knowledge, witte, and skill, And all the world doth fame and glory gayne That chastly liues, it talkes with God aboue, It climbes the Cloudes from pomp and pleasures vayne. It is a thing that shining Angels loue, And in the world to come shall liue and raigne. It triumph makes of fickle fond desire, It breedes great force and courage full in men, It quencheth sparkes and flames of fancies fire, It quickes the wittes, and helpes the art of penne, Yea all good giftes from Chastitie doth rise That worthy are of honor vnder Skyes. Then sith (ô Queene) chast life is thus thy choyce, And that thy heart is free from bondage yoke, Thou shalt (good Queene) by my consent and voyce, Haue halfe the spoyle, take eyther bowe or cloke. The bowe (I thinke) more fitte for such a one In fleshly forme, that beares a heart of stone That none can wound, nor pearce by any meane. Wherefore take heere the bow, and learne to shoote At whome thou wilt, thy heart it is so cleane, Blind Cupids boltes therein can take no roote. Now will I say in this poore Coatch of mine, To mount the Skyes, and see the Gods deuine. Cvpid commes running afoote like a vagabond towards the Queene, from Wantonnesse and Riot where he was succoured, and meetes againe in open shew the Philosopher, whose habitation was in a Rocke, and the Philosopher demaundes of Cvpid where he hathe bin, and what is the cause he commes abroade in such disorder. The Philosopher speaketh. How now my friend, where hast thou bin? in other plight I trow Thou wast, when lately I thee met, hath Cupid lost his bow? His cloke? his Coatch his witte and all? and fled from mothers face? Or else hath Cupid gone to Schole, to learne some prettie Grace? To play the God, fye foolish boy, leaue of these toyes in time, Thy Mother (as the Poets fayne,) when beautie was in prime A strumpet was, it may be so, as well appeareth yet, Thou art not of the race of Gods, thou art some Beggers chitte. Cupid. Nay doting foole, that still dost pore on Bookes, Though Coatch be gone, and golden cloke be lost, Yet like a God, I tell thee Cupid lookes, When old grey beard shewes like a rotten post. It yll becommes an aged man to rayle On women thus, that are not now in place, But sure thy words are spent to small auayle, They can not blot my mother, nor my race. Philosopher. But dost thou thinke thou art a God? then shew some proofe therof. Cupid. That can I do, but you old men, with boyes will iest and scoffe, And either laugh to scorne our words, or taunt vs past the nick. Philosopher. Beleeue not that, but when in deede we enter neere the quicke, Ye wincke like Coltes, and fling away from witte and feeling seene, Wel Cupid, prooue thou art a God, and shew some good defence, To this thy talke, I will giue eare, and silence keepe a whyle, Vntill thy words haue gone so farre, thy folly makes me smyle. Cupid. The greatest Clarkes that earst haue bin, three thousand yeres agoe, When they on Venus talke or treate, takes Cupids part ye knowe. Their bokes, their scrolles, their p?phlets large, makes m?ti? of my name, You nede no further search for proof, to try out Cupids fame. Philosopher. Boast not of booke; for bookes they be, that plainely witnes beares How Cupids arte infects good minds, and canckers honest eares. And though fond men in Fables shew on you a flourish fine, Such geegawes grees not with good rules, nor holds on gifts deuine. Cupid. Why Sir, you will beleeue, that Ioue and many more Of other Gods in Heauen are, where I haue bin before? Philosopher. In Heauen? there you trippe, why boy how came you thence? You went abroade to take the ayre, and haue bin walking sence Like dawes along the coast, O boy, thy proofe is bare, In Heauen is but one that rules, no other Gods there are. Cupid. And doth not Ioue and Mars beare sway? tush that is true. Philosopher. Then put in Tom and Tibbe, and all beares sway as much as you. Cupid. I told you Sir before, your taunting tong would bite. Philosopher. I come too neere the sore, and please not your delight. But since you fume for naught, and can not heare the truth, I will not shame my hoarie heares, to striue with wanton youth. This Cupid, Venus sonne, as men suppose to bee, Is neyther God nor Man in forme, nor monster as you see, But such a kind of shade, as can no substance shoe, Begot by braynelesse blind delight, and nurst with natures foe. Fed vp with faithlesse foode, and traynd in trifling toyes, Awakt with vice, and luld asleepe agayne with yrkesome ioyes. Wantonnesse and Riotte commes in, and talkes with Cvpid, and so takes him away. Wantonnesse. Art thou so fond to talke with doting age, This Man did bring thy mother in a rage, And told hir playne, a Goddesse faynd she was, Most leawd of life, and brittle as the glasse, I Wantonnesse knowe well that tale is true, To this my friend now Riotte what say you? Riotte. I could say much, but I will hold my peace, Foule is that bird that his owne neast defiles. If Riot should not speake, that Venus knowes so well, (With whom since Cupid bare a name, did want? Venus dwel) Much pitie were it sure, that Riot life should beare, For I am father of delight and pleasure euery where. Without the help of whome, Dame Venus can not liue, For vnto Lust and Riot both, doth Venus honor giue. And Lust is Riots ioy, a spright that pleades for place In euery soyle, since world began to boast of Adams race. And now to tell you playne, from me, or from my stocke, (An endlesse swarme of ydle folke, a merrie carelesse flocke) As prating Poets fayne, at first did Venus spring, But Venus was no strumpet sure; she was some finer thing That alwayes furthers Loue, in French a M[illeg.]rca playne, A beater of good bargaynes oft, and roote of fancyes vayne. Though Goddesse were she not, yet faire and fine was she, As I haue heard good Clarkes report, and you in Bookes shal see Of hir great Storyes made, and great accompt thys day We make of Venus darlings still, wherefore in briefe to say, Both I and thousands more, with Venus needes must hold. Twas she, to whome King Priams sonne did giue the apple of golde That cost so many liues: but reade the seege of Troy, And you shall see what prettie pranckes the mother and this boy Hath playd in many partes, my knowledge is but small, I tell by heeresay many things, but am not learnd at all Good Wantonnesse thou knowst, but passe ore that awhile I could tell tales of Venus yet, would make the hearers smile. Wantonnesse. O speake no more, come comfort Cupid now, Let Venus go, that sate and saw with eye The order great, and all the manner how Dame Chastitie did mount to Starrie Skye With such a Coatch, and such a noble spoyle, As seldome hath in Heauen oft bin seene. She sayd, when she had Cupid put to foyle, She gaue his bowe and shaftes vnto a Queene. And Cupid streight came running vnto me. I saw him bare, and sent him bare away, And as we are in deede but bare all three, So must we part as poorely as we may. No reasoning heere with him that learned is, Philosophers knowes more than wanton fooles, If we had once bin beaten well eare this And lovd our Bookes, and truely plyde our Scholes, We had bin learnd, yea livd, and felt no lacke, Where now our wealth is all vpon our backe. Riotte. BY sweete Sainct Iohn we are in goodly weedes, To daunce with belles a Morrice through the Streets. If any heere, three ydle people needes, Call vs in time, for we are fine for sheetes: Yea, for a shift, to steale them from the hedge, And lay both sheetes, and linnen all to gage. We are best be gone, least some do heare alledge We are but Roages, and clappe vs in the Cage. Come Cupid come, if thou wilt heare a song, Dame Chastitie hath sent hir Coatch along, To comfort those, that dayly liues in wo. Cupid. Nay Cupid will, go hang himselfe I trow. Much better were, to fall on poynt of knife, Than from rich state, to leade a beggers life. Cupid, Wantonnesse, and Riot, departs, and the Coatch softly commes on, with such Musicke as is deuised, and sings not, vntill the Coatch be before the Queene, in the meane while the Philosopher speaketh. Philosopher. Now world may iudge what fables are, &amp; what vain gods ther be, What names and titles fondlings giue, to th?, likewise you see, And that one God alone doth rule, the rest no vertue showe, Vayne Venus and blind Cupid both, and all the ragment rowe And rabble of Gods, are fayned things, to make the season short, As wisedome knowes that wel c? wey, the worth &amp; weight of sport. Through trifles light, sad things are sene, through vice is vertue fo?d, By hollow wayes, and crooked pathes, appeares the playnest ground. Thus leauing vnto wisedomes reach, the things that heere are done, And fearing foyle, if heere we should, in further folly runne, We stay, saue that, some Musicke commes, to knitte in order due, The substance of thys sillie Shew, that we present to you. Modestie, Temperance, Good exercise and Shamefastnesse; the wayting Maydes of Chastitie returne, come in and Sing: and after that Modestie speaketh. The Song. Chast life liues long and lookes on world and wicked wayes, Chast life for losse of pleasures short, doth winne immortall prayse. Chast life hath merrie moodes, and soundly taketh rest, Chast life is pure as babe new borne, that hugges in mothers brest. Leawd life cuttes off his dayes, and soone runnes out his date, C?fo?ds good wits, breeds naughty bloud, and weakens mans estate. Leawd life the Lord doth loath, the lawe and land mislikes, The wise will shunne, fonde fooles do seek, and God sore plagues and strikes. Chast life may dwell alone, and find few fellowes now, And sitte and rule in regall throne, and serch lewd manners throw. Chast life feares no mishappe, the whole account is made, When soule from worldly cares is crepte, and sittes in sacred shade. Leude life is laughte to scorne, and put to great disgrace, In hollow caues it hides the head, and walkes with muffled face, Found out and poynted at, a monster of the mind, A canckred worme, that conscience eates, and strikes cleere senses blind. Chast life a pretious pearle, doth shine as bright as Sunne, The fayre houre glasse of dayes and yeares, that neuer out will runne. The beautie of the soule, the bodyes blisse and ease, A thing that least is lookt vnto, yet most the mind shall please. Modestie speaketh. Dame Chastitie we serue, and wayte vpon hir still, Saue now, that she is cald to Cloudes, to know Iehouas will. She bad vs walke abroade, and searche, where might be seene In stately troupe, and royall Court, a worthy noble Queene. Salute hir in my name, and looke in secret sort (Quoth she) you do with al your force, maynteyne hir princely port. Good exercise as chiefe, thy humble dutie doo, Let Shamefastnesse, and Modestie, and sober Temprance too, Attend as handmaydes still, vpon that sacred dame. We hearing what our mistresse sayd, &amp; marking wel the same, Did hast vs hither streight, but ere we went at large, Iehoua sent vs Graces great, and gaue vs powre and charge, (When pomp is most in place) to creepe in princely hart, And gide the mind, &amp; throughly serch, the soule &amp; euery part. That still the feare of God, be burning in hir brest, Ther is the only house O Quene, wher we four maids wil rest, There we will seruice shew, there shall our vertues budde, Ther is the plot, the seate, the soyle, and place to do most good. Yea vnder richest roabes, we haue a powre to goe, In fairest weedes are cleanest thoughts, &amp; purest minds I know. The earlish Countrey cloyne, yea clad in smeared cloke, With c?ckred hart, &amp; currish lokes, sits grinning in the smoke. The comely cleane attire, doth carrie mind aloft, Makes m? think scorne to stoupe to vice, &amp; loke to Vertue oft. The Sunne that shineth bright, hath vertues manifold, A gallant floure hath pleasant smell, great goodnesse is in gold. So gay and glittring Dame, thy graces are not small, Thy heauenly gifts in greatest prease, in deede surmo?ts th? all. Thurseday. [Most royall Prince, speede on thy comely pace] Firste, Lady Beauty speaketh, and she attyred in very goodly garmentes as becommeth such a Dame. Most royall Prince, speede on thy comely pace, Make hast in time, to do thy subiects good, Go runne with me, to stay this heauie cace, Take paynes good Queene, to gayne the giltlesse blood. In one mans life, saue liues of many moe, Saue him in whome, the state of others stayes, For I poore wretch, God knowes am minded so, With him to liue, with him to end my dayes. Who now in force, of Tyrants hands doth lye, And vaynely striues, to scape his helplesse fate, Who seeth his death, and dolefull date so nigh, Go hast to help, and yet perhaps too late. Manhode. Yet were I best, to kill this peeuish Boy, Whome now she makes, hir chiefe and sole delight, In whome she finds, such pleasure and such ioy, That causelesse I, am cleane defaced quite. Such gaudyes gay, are in his Peacocks face, And skinne smootht vp, with shew of ydle hue, That I do lodge, and languish in disgrace, Though she of me, hath proofe of promise true. Well, make thy choyce, and see what likes thee best, View heere the death, of this thy darling now, Or yeeld thy loue, to fancie my request, Whose manly force, shall winne the conquest throw. Beautie. Naught shalt thou winne, by that which I shall lose, Thou getst no gaynes, though I be thus bereft, And though that I, betweene two mischiefes goes, Where naught but bale, and wretched woe is less, Yet thy reward, which doest assault my friend, (In whose delight, my heart was fedde long whyle) Shall be disdeyne, and hatered in the ende, A guerdon fitte, for such a Tyrant vile. Manhode. This wretch is he, by whome I am annoyde, He hath thy heart, though I deserue the same, If wisely then, I do my harmes auoyde, Why stey I sword, I can not purchase blame, By cutting off, the cause of my distresse, When he is gone, my lette shall be the lesse. Beautie. How canst thou say, thou doest dezerue my heart, Which kilst my heart, and causest all my woe, Manhode. Since that thou takest, my dealing in such part, I will delight, to wreake my wrath on foe. In greeuing thee, most glad to heare me grone, And art most pleasd, when Manhode makes his moane. Beautie. O gracious Prince, to thee my mone I make, And prostrate fall, O Prince before thy foote, With wonted grace, on me some pitie take, O salue my sore, let sorrow find some boote. I swelt in sighes, and sure shall dye to see My friend dispatcht, and murthred in this wise, O bid the wretch, come thrust his sword in me, For from my loue, the cause of griefe doth rise. I made the fault, then punish me therefore, Shall silly Lamb, be ledde to slaughter thus? Do eyther help, with death my endlesse sore, Or with remorse, and ruth the case discusse, If he do dye, by Mightie Ioue I sweare I will not liue, if sword or knife be found, With scratched face, with rent and torne heare, I know at first, my corpse will fall in sound, And then adue, my sprite shall steale away, O Queene, in hast, now bidde the Tyrant stay, Manhoode. Since thou, O Prince, forbidst reuenge to take, And wilst that men, should lose their time in loue, Then marke my case, and giue me leaue to make Myne owne defence, and so alleadge and proue, And I will shewe my right and title good, And that I do, deserue the thing I craue. Though this fond wretch, alwayes my sute withstoode, As one who long, in furies fittes doth raue, Whome leawd delight, hath ledde out of the way, (Which good Aduise, and ordred Iudgement keepe) Whome Beauties blast hath bounst against the bay, Where craggy rockes, and sands lye hidde in deepe, A fond deuice to trust to paynted face, And fasten fayth vpon so fickle stay, To whome Dame Hebe, lends often guisefull grace, Which euery yeare and day doth plucke away, Whome sicknesse spoyles, and many sorowes moe, Whome time doth eate and age at length deuoures, Whome cares of mind do shake and alter so, As Winter winds defaceth Sommer floures. A snare for witte, a bayte for wanton youth, A false conceyte, an error of the mind, A fond delight, wherein there is no truth, A poysoned dish, that doth the reason blind. A colour cast on things that are but bace, A glorious shew, to shrowde a homely part, A rule to runne, a leawd and retchlesse race, A deepe deceyte, which daunteth oft the heart. In rage of youth, these pricking thistles growes, Whiles Riot raygnes, and Folly beares the sway In hoarie age, Deuice and Councell showes, Where borrowed hew, and blossome fades away. The weaker sexe, in beautie doth excell, The infant hath, the sleeke, and smoothest face, The hurtfull weede, which yeeldes allothsome smell, To view of eye, doth vaunt a glorious grace. In outward showes, in deede the trust is small, They are but clokes, and vizards of deceight, The vertuous mind, and manlike sprite is all, Which gaynes renowme, and mounteth to the height. Dame Venus loues, the fierce and warlike Knight, Though once alas, she loud him to hir payne. And Ladyes which, do loue and iudge aright, Loue such as can, their cause with force maynteyne. What could thys Boy, do for his mistresse sake? Whome could this face, subdue in open field? Iudge thou, O Queene, which of vs two could make The better shift, and force the worst to yeeld. Good fauoure. Yet let me pleade, my cause before my Queene As thou hast done, and sentence after craue, Then shall the truth, of our two sutes be seene, I craue no spoyle, but wish the thing I haue. Why should my beautie, purchase my disgrace? Why should my prayse, become mine vtter shame? Why should Dame Natures giftes be thought so base, Which heeretofore haue bin in greater name? Who euer could, enforce the Gods with might, To yeeld themselues, as conquerd with his strength? Yet Beautie hath, subdude them with his sight, And made them bend, and bow to him at length. Whome force subdues, with sadde vnwilling heart, Submittes themselues, and greeue at euery stroke: Who Beautie winnes, and gaynes vnto his part, They gladly graunt, to take the pleasant yoke. Thy strength thou mayst, full many a Winter hide, Till time doth serue, to shew the same in place, Sweete Beautie can, no moment be vnspide, But doth delight, each one with gladsome grace. Dame Natures shew, and Ritches Beautie is, A Heauenly gift, to rauish euery eye, A perfite Pearie, wherein is naught but blisse, Delight of men, delight of Gods on high. Apollo pleasd, himselfe with Golden heare, Heabe delightes, the Gods with comely hue, God Venus oft, hir tender brest did teare, When she Adonis death was fayne to rue. Phœbus did mourne, when his delight was slayne, With great mishappe, and error of his hand, But Gannimed, about with Ioue doth raigne. And wayting on, his Nectars cuppe doth stand. What should I speake, of him who at the brooke, The wanton Nimphes, in loue supprisd away, Or him whome Phœb, in to hir Charriot tooke, Or him, whose beautie dimd the morning grey, The Gods in beautie, passe each mortall wight, And men surmount, in forme the fayrest beast, And yet of them, some are more braue in sight, Whose natures are, more fined than the rest. The vgly Tode, swels out his poyson cold, A crabbed corpse, commes of a churlish kind, No ragged mold, the vertue rare can hold, A seemely face, declares a modest mind. The fayrest Horse will swiftest runne his race, The gallantst Hound, will soonest wind his game, What neede I more, to treate vpon this cace, The hearers shall, be iudgers of the same, If Beauties giftes, and fauoure you exile, Then Manhode must, be heere preferd the while. Dezart. Stay iudgement Prince, and let my cace be know?en? Whose friendly toyle, deserues to reape his gayn?e? Mine earnest sute, may not be thus orethrowen, So long employd, in hope and endlesse payne. I see these men, prease boldly heere in place, Vnfolds great words, and long debates the cace: And braues it out, with goodly gallant Shewes, Which I will not, eclips nor blot at all, My clayme is good, and that iust God he knowes, What neede I then, my right in question call. I haue no force, nor skill in marshiall field, I boast not of my fresh and flouring hue, Nor yet neede not, in any poynt to yeeld, That can alleadge, Dezarts and seruice true. My trauell then, and truth may not be lost, Nor my good will, be recompenst with wrong, Nor he that hath, with tempestes sore bin tost, And tasted griefes, and bitter torments long, May not so soone, be shaken off for nought, I take fine tearmes, to shew my secret thought. The Gods accepts, our dutie in good part, The Prince rewards, the billes of our request, The greatest men, consider but the heart, The friendly meanes, can tame the wildest beast. And Women who, in softest mouldes be cast, Whose tender heartes, rues on our carefull cryes, Must needes be wonne, with louing meanes at last, To ease our playntes, and wipe our watered eyes. True loue of right, must recompenced be, Dezart must needes, flye farre beyond the rest, Then graunt O Prince, this pretious prise to me, Whose loyall loue, claymes place aboue the best. Good fortune. Mvch words are spent, where speech shall not preuayle, Long time is lost, in threats and fond dispute, Though I good Happe, haue borne but simple sayle, And went aloofe, tis I must end thys sute, And reason bring, as victor of the field, Vnto whose troth, your weake discourse shall yeeld. Faire Beautie heere, for whome you fondlings striue, May moue, I graunt, a God to like hir well, But though she were, the fayrest thing aliue, (As sure indeede, hir beautie doth excell) Is that a proofe, that you in loue must fall, With that which nought pertaynes to you at all? Admitte hir mind, by meane of some consayte, With sweete delight, of fancie may be ledde, Your eagre eyes, most greedie of such bayte, In forward hope, a season hath bin fedde. Shall she be spoyld, for fauoure she bestowes In friendly sort, and not in faithfull wise? Nay sure, she shall, ne fame nor freedome lose, For fraylties faultes, or vse of gracious eyes. But to the poynt, and purpose of your strife, One pleades good will, by shape and fauoure got, (A gallant Boy, to please a pleasant wife) Another tels a penned tale by rote, Bedeckt and fylde with ynckhorne tearmes ynow. The third commes in, and calles himselfe Dezart, And each of them are seene in Storyes throw, And finely seekes to conquere Loue by arte. Great sleight is vsd, and Clarkly cunning both, To force a right, and iudgement in this cace, Dezart, he telles a trimme discourse of troth, The tender twigge makes boast of shining face. And Courage he, by Manhood claymeth all, Great poynts they are, that pleaded are this day, And vnto whome, the Lady now should fall, Some doubts may rise, if reason bore the sway. But to be briefe, fayre Shape and comely port, The wise men hold, but outward blossoms vayne, And Manhoods force, may heere be knitte vp short, Stoute hearts may not, alone the glorie gayne: Nor yet Dezart, that neerest goes the gole, May winne the prise, and thrust his better backe, For he it is, that hath the greatest dole, That doth in deede, no peece of Fortune lacke. Good Fortune still, a Lord of worldly chance Is only iudge, himselfe, of all is done, Bid Strength stand backe, good Fortune leades the Dance, Fine shape likewise, with Fortune dare not runne. Dezart is dead, where Fortune men aduance. So heere I prooue, since I good Fortune haue, This Dame is mine, hir destnie willes it so, In Mothers wombe, the Gods this gift me gaue, She ordeynd was, with me away to goe. Each worldly grace, and rule with Fortune flyes, A wife must needes, then stoupe to destnyes lot. Wherefore I heere, possesse thys noble prize, As Iewell rich, by happe and Fortune got. Who striues to take, hir now from me by force, Shall haue withall, my breath and vitall corse. Then talke the other three priuilie togither, and Manhoode speakes to Good Fortune as followes. Manhode. Me thinkes most fond, and weakely commes hee heere Alone to three, if we togither stoode: And though in deede, we buy the quarrell deere, And pay therefore, the sweetest of our bloud, Yet let vs shew, the noble hearts of men, For since he sayth, we all our labour lose, Not one of vs, shall neede to sorow then, Nor care a figge, how ere the matter goes. Dezart. A greed, though I Dezart haue double wrong, I will reuenge the same by dint of sword, And you shall see, I will not dallie long To do my best, sith I haue spoke the word. Despayred men, dare fight with Fortune still, And scratch for life, as long as breath will last, When hope is gone, I know no better skill, But bide the brunt, till all the broyle be past. Let loue and life, togither make an ende, The heart shall feele, and hand shall head defend. Good fauoure. Though I speake last, that first found speciall grace, In formost sight, looke you for tender yeares, And iudge him not, a Milke soppe by his face, That stoutely like a Man at neede appeares. Great skorne I thinke, good Fortune should haue all, And reape the right, that laboure long hath sowen, Yea, Fauoure hath perhappes more friends at call, Than you would thinke, or to the world is knowen. Heere follow the Speeches of the water Nymphes, which should haue bin shewed vpon the Thurseday, had not euill weather hindered the same. The first Nymphes Speech. We Water Nimphs haue time to sport, &amp; skip in euery place, Wh? days are l?g, &amp; nights be short, &amp; Phœbus hides his face, And hearing that there came a Queene, along this water side, So long as we poore silly Nimphes, on land dare well abide, We daunce, we hop, and bounse it vp, in honor of hir name, To whome Diana and hir trayne, doth giue immortall fame. The seconde. We shun the Sunne, yet loue the Mone, &amp; hate the open light, We hide our heads amid the Reedes, in blustring stormy night. In calmest weather do we play, yet seldome seene we are, We watch our times, and flee from those, that stil doe on vs stare. We harme no wight, yet fearefull be, to those that haue no spreete, We are some hold of Wom?s sexe, and gladde with m? to meete. The thirde. The Phayries are another kind, of elfes that daunce in darke, Yet can light Candles in the night, and vanish like a sparke, And make a noyse and rumbling great, among the dishes oft, And wake the sleepie sluggish Maydes, that lyes in Kitchen loft. And when in field, they treade the grasse, from water we repayre, And hoppe and skippe, with th? sometime, as weather waxeth fayre. The fourth and last that called them into their caue. What rule is this, what tales tel you, what bable do you make? Will you tel secrets out of Schole? beware, if bugges awake You will be shent, come hye you hence, can yee abide the viewe, The gaze, and staring such a whyle, of all this noble crue? Though that we came to honor hir, that Gods on high haue blest, It is a shame for water Nimphes, on earth so long to rest. Fridayes Deuice. The Queene of Phayries Speech. Though cleane against the Phayries kind, we come in open viewe, (And that the Queene of Phayries heere, presents hirselfe to you) Some secret cause procures the same: the Gods at first, ye know, In field to honour thee good Queene, did make a gallant shew: Should we that are but sprites of thaire, refuse to do the same? No sure, for Gods and mortall men, shall serue thee noble Dame. The seconde. When Mercury came first in Coatch, a message to vnfolde, (And Maske of Gods amid the night, in ch?ber secrets told) We warned were to shape our selues, to do what Ioue assignd, But water Nymphes stept in the while, and so exprest their mynd, And thrust poore Phayries out of place, yet we: for feare of foyle, Watcht here our time, &amp; for our sports, did chose this certain soyle. The thirde. Yea out of hedge we crept in deede, where close in caues we lay, And knowing by the brute of fame, a Quene must passe this way, To make hir laugh, we clapt on cotes, of Segges and Bulrush both, That she shuld know, &amp; world should say, lo there the Phayries goth, Like Furies madde, and Satyres wild yet loe, we haue in store Fine Timbrels, that the Auntients vse, to make the shew the more. The fourth. Wh? saints &amp; soules, &amp; sprites of m?, fr? Heau? downe did fling, (And Iehoua spake, and Cloudes did shake, &amp; many a crowned King. Crept out of graue, to honor thee, we ready were to wait, But Hagges of Hell, &amp; damned Feends, that feedes on false delayt Did blush to see thy presence Queene, but we that harmelesse were, Kept loue in store, to shew at length our dutie voyde of feare. The fifth. Bvt when that Cupid was condemnd, and Venus fell in rage, And Wantonnesse &amp; Riot rude, for knackes were clapt in cage, And all the ragment rowe of Gods, to one great God gaue place, We sillie Phayries were afeard, therewith to shew our face. Yet when we saw a Maske well likt, and Gods condemnd appeere, We did consult, at last farewell, the Phayries should be heere. The sixth. Bvt with Orations good and great, to wall the weake was thrust, Yet wh? the strongest did their best, of force yet speake we must. For Ioue that all commands, and doth, bade vs to watch the howre, And shew no more at this adue, than was in Phayries powre. So keeping course of Ioues commaund, we speake that is in brest, And leaue the Queene and all the trayne, with wit to iudge the rest. The seauenth. With Gods, yea kings &amp; Quenes, beg? your entrie to this place, With g?tle Gosts &amp; merrie sprites, we mind to end the cace. So in good signe of happie chance, to thee O sacred Queene, To knit vp all, we meane to daunce with Timbrels on this greene. And then farewell, we can no more, salute thee in oure gise, All that is done, by great good will, is offered to the wise. A matter touching the Iourney of Sir Humfrey Gilbarte Knight. The man that trauels much, with mind and body both, (Whose restlesse lims, &amp; labring thoughtes, through heaps of hazards goth,) A while would gladly rest, and so some sollace taste, To sharp the sense, and ease the heart, that toyle doth weare and waste. But though with charged brest, I seeke to steale a nappe, In hope sounde sleepes would soone forget, the griefe of thankelesse happe: Some cause calls vp my Muse, and bids my witts awake, That dowwne is layde on quiet Coutch, a little ease to take: As lately loe you heard, by Verses penned well, Which soundes so shrilly through my eares, and tings so like a Bell, That though in sadde dead sleepe, my wery body were, I must rise vp and whet my wittes, and lend a louing eare To that new tale I heere, of friends that hence do go Vnto a soyle they neuer saw, another world I trow That few or none haue found, well, what should more be sayd, The Iourney that my friends do take, full long in head I wayd, Yet thought to pause awhile, (eare pen to paper past) To see how course of world wold go, and things fell out at last. And thus in my delay I caught a slumber sweete, And sure me thought infearful dreme, or sweauon did I meete The Golden Heart, and other Ships, that to this voyage goes, Which Barks wer brauely vnder saile, where water ebbes and floes. And where the view of Co?trey soile, was farre from Saylers sight, And men were forst to trie the Seas in storme or darkest night, But eare my dreame could ende, a voyce gan call alowde, Wheris Churchyard: doth he sleepe? or is he crept in Clowde, To shunne the vse of penne and matter worthy note? Whereat I started out of bedde, and streight wey vp I gote, And to my Studie dore in hast therewith I went, As one that fain wold write some thing that might the World content. Then brought I vnto mind, the heauie Dreame I had, Yet eare I wrote one Englishe verse, I cald my little ladde, And bad him runne with speede abroade, and bring some newes, And learne the troth of euery thing, that I might shape my Muse To please the peoples eares with frute of Poets penne. My Lackey had not walkt in Pawles not twentie pasis then, But heard that sundrie friends of mine, had taken leaue At Courte, and were all Shipte away. this brute may thee deceyue Thou foolish Boy (quoth I) nay Sir by sweete Sainct Iohn (Quoth he) Sir Humffey Gilbart ?s?ure, and all his troupe is gone. But whether, no man knowes, saue they that are in Barke, Who with one mind, and one consent, do hope to hitte one marke. A ha Sir boy (quoth I) I knew this long agoe, Shut study dore, packe hence a while, and musing euen so, I marueld howe this Knight, could leaue his Lady heere, His friends, and prettie tender babes, that he did hold so deere, And take him to the Seas, where dayly dangers are. Then wayd I how, immortall Fame, was more than worldly care, And where great mind remaynes, the bodyes rest is small, For Countreys wealth, for priuate gayne, or glory seeke we all. And such as markes this world, and notes the course of things, The weake and tickle stay of states, and great affayres of Kings, Desires to be abroade, for causes more than one, Content to liue as God appoyntes, and let the world alone. Yea such as deepely looke, into these worldly toyes, And freedome of the body still, and noble mind enioyes, Are glad to trudge and toyle, and driue off time awhile, And at our ydle pleasures laughs, or at our follies smyle: That will not take some paynes, and trye both land and Seas, For Knowledge seeke, and heape of happe, to do our Countrey ease. O Gilbart noble Knight, God send thee thy desire, O manly Knolles, and worthy Wight, whose heart doth still aspire, I wish thee great renowme, and noble Carie too, And noble North, with Wigmore wise, I wish you well to do. O Rawley ripe of sprite, and rare right many wayes, And liuely Nowell, God you guide, to purchase endlesse prayse. Goe comely Cotten too, and march amidde the rancke, And honest Dennie with the best, must needes deserue some thanke. George Carie forth I call, and sure Iohn Roberts heere, A speciall sparke with present witte, in person shall appeare. Miles Morgan gaynes good Fame, and Whetstone steps in place, And seekes by trauell, and by toyle, to winne him double grace. Iohn Vdall is not hidde, nor Rowles I do forgette, The rest I vow to publish out, and so dwell in their dette. But though that Frances Knolles commes last vnto my mind, Among the first that shall do well, he will not be behind. O faithfull friends farewell, I namd you all aroe, For World to view, whiles world doth last, what courage you do shoe. What charges you are at, what venter you haue made, And how you seeke to traffike there, where neuer yet was trade. And most of you such men, as liuings haue at home, So great and good, that sure abrode yee neede not for to rome: Faire houses, lands, and wiues, great friends, and of the best, Good stayes and pillers, wherevpon the strongest heere may rest: Well knowne, and honord both, in credite euery way, In perfite plighte and state to liue, and laugh, though world say nay. This strange adiew of youres, doth argue noble harts, And in your brestes are noble giftes and many noble parts. For hauing wealth at will, and world at becke and call, Propt vp with Princes fauoure still, so sure ye could not fall: And yet to leaue that hope, to seeke vncertayne happe, And so committe your goods &amp; liues, to euery stormy clappe That suddayne tempest brings: me thinke the venture great, The value of your valiant minds, surmountes the fire in heate. Whereof such hote desires of doing good, doth rise, The kindled [illeg.] do sparckle through the Skyes Some people happly thinke a greedie hope of gayne, And heapes of gold you hope to find doth make you take this payne Oh sure that can not be, conceyue the case who list For hauing that which thousands w?t, alreadie in your fist, You meane to clime for Fame, as high as eye may looke And search the Creekes and priuie Portes, and euery secret nooke, As farre as Shippe may sayle: I trust for Countreys good: And for the commonwealthes auayle, you offer life and bloud Let world now speake the worst, and babble what they please, What thing could make you take these toyles, and so forsake your ease If God moud not your minds, to things he liekth well, And that your good and deepe consaytes, wherein you long did dwell, Did leade and hall you thence, as men prepard and wrought, To shew what witte and skill men haue, and serue the makers thought, That all thing cleerely sees: tis God and your good mind, That driues you to this high attempt, for any thing I find. And as he sent you out, so can he bring you in, Yea safely home, that you shall shew at large where you haue bin, And now to tell it plaine, not one of all your troupe, (Of gentle race) that neere at home, did hold downe head or droupe, But brauely bore it out which shewes, no neede it was, That did procure those gallants gay, from hence in hast to passe. Thus sure some other thing than gayne, did cause you goe, Some noble fire that burnes in brest, whose flames of force must shoe Good meaning and good mind, good frute and grayne withall, When season serues, and haruest commes, and hope for hire doth call. You might haue walkt the streetes, as other gallants do, Yea kept the Court and Countrey both, in Pawles haue ietted too. If mind had not bin drawne, to things of greater weight, And had not harts held vp your heads another kind of heigth, Perhaps in ydle dayes, you would set men a worke, And call them to accompt in hast, that close in corners lurke: And aske in open place, how they would spend their time, And if they say they had no mind the loftie Cloudes to clime, Yet would you wish they should see what on earth is found, And search the proofe, and sayle by arte, about the world so round. At home to tarrie still, but breedes grosse bloud and witte, Then better with the Fawcon flie, than heere on dunghill sitte, And see how Crowes do feede, on tainted carren bare, Or liue a leawd and wretched life, vpon a hungry share. At home much time is lost, and neuer found againe, Much household cares, and common griefes, do breake both sleepe and brayne. Abroade men winne great wealth, or knowledge gayne at least, At home we runne to wanton sportes, and smell out euery feast. Abroade small bankets are, it will not quit the cost, At home is naught but making loue to euery paynted post. Abroade the flesh is tamde, and brought in feare and frame, At home oft times pride goes before, and after commeth shame. Abroade we Wisedome learne, and do from follie flee, At home some daunce so in a nette, their selues they can not see. Abroade where seruice is, much honor may be wonne, At home our gay vayneglory goes, like shadow in the Sunne. Abroade bare robes are best, and Manhoode makes the showe, At home yong Maister must be fine, or all is lost you know. Abroade few quarrels are, a brawle is bought so deere, At home they cogge, they foyst, they royst, and reuell all the yeare. Abroade is courteys speech, and ciuill order still, At home where rudenesse keepes no rule, wilde wantons take their will. Abroade may health be got, for laboure lengthens life, At home the Goute, the Cramp, the cold, and each disease is rife. Abroade the sightes are strange, and wonders may be seene, At home a stale and balde deuice, but duls the spreetes I weene. Abroade we learne to spare, to serue our turne in thend, At home men set the cocke on hoope, and vaynely spoyle and spend. Abroade few theeues you haue, they find so little grace, At home foule shiftes and robbries both, abounde in euery place. Thus prooue I trauels best, for body, soule, and sense, And ease a nurse to pamper vice, and buckler of defense. Where vertue can not strike, nor enter any way, The buckler hath such wicked barres dame Vertues force to stay. With rest leawd lust doth rise, and soone subdues the mind. And toyle beares backe fond Venus toyes, and strikes vaine fancie blind. Much rest runnes Riot still, and breedeth treasons oft, And toyle plucks downe those haughtie hearts that lokes to mount alofte. Rest maketh mischiefe ripe, and settes bad things abroch, Toyle teacheth men to conquer Fame, and flee from foule reproch. Rest loues to dallie much, like whelp that waues the rayle, Toyle is for Vertue quicke as Bee, for Vice as slow as Snayle. Rest sowes no blessed feede, yet reapes a curssed grayne, Toyle weedes the ground, and planteth floures where nettles did remayne. Rest will no dutie know, but shakes off shackels still, Toyle makes the body apte to stoupe, to bend and shew good will. Rest is a retchlesse ioy, that sees not his owne harmes, Toyle castes out many a vayne consayte, that rest brings in by swarmes. If toyle bring these good things that I haue told before, And rest but want and beggrie breedes, with sundrie mischiefes more: They ought haue endlesse lawd, that in these loytring dayes Set ydle hands and heads a worke, to winne immortall prayse. And they that first found out the strange and forrayne soyle, Are gone themselues to win the prise, or take the open foyle, Which shewes them more than men, halfe Gods if I say troth, Whole kingdomes scarcely c? suffice their minds and manhoode both. Now haue they taken leaue of worldly pleasures all, That yong and lusty were to liue, and now to toyle they fall That finely were brought vp, yea now they bidde adiew, The glittring Court, the gall?t towne, the gorgious garments new, The brauerie of this world, the pride and pomp of earth, And looke not backward any way, to ritches, race, or birth. To worthy wife nor friend, to babes nor neerest kinne, But only to the Lord aboue, and iourney they are in. And all for Countreys cause, and to enrich the same, Now do they hazard all they haue: and so for wealth and fame, They fare along the Seas, they sayle and tide it out, They hale and stretch the sheates aloft, they toyle and dread no doubt. They feede on Bisket hard, and drincke but simple beere, Salt beefe, and Stockfish drie as kecke, is now their greatest cheere. And still a fulsome smell of pitch and tarre they feele, And when Seasicke (God wot) they are, about the Shippe they reele. And stomacke belcheth vp, a dish that Hadocks seeke, A bitter messe of sundry meates, a Sirrope greene as leeke. Then head and heart doth heaue, and body waxeth cold: Yet face will sweat, a heauie sight, the same is to behold. But they must needes abide a greater brunt than this, And hope that after hellish paynes, there commes a time of blisse. Yet note the torments strange, that toyling saylers haue, Who liues at mercie of the Seas: yea surge and swelling wave, Would swallow vp the Shippe, if Pylots were not good, And some in time of great distresse vnto their tackle stood. Sometime a flaw of wind blowes Maister ore the Hatch, And Boy fr? toppe coms tumbling downe, and at a cord doth catch To saue his sillie life, aloofe then cries my mates, No neerer shore the Ship she tucke, and on the sand the grates, And plying for aboorde, about the Vessell goes, And through the shroudes and clouted Sayles a gale of winde there bloes, That seemes to shake the Barke, in sunder euery ribbe, Then is no time to heaue she can to crie carous and bibbe, But each man to his worke they fall and flie apace, In necke of this a man of warre that seekes to giue the chace, They spie in halfe a kenne, vp Sould youres ho in hast The Captayne calls, yet vnder hatch, a sort of them are plast, To beate the enmie out that should the Shippe assayle, At length the Cannon bullet flyes, and shotte as thicke as hayle Goes off to murther men, and such a smoke doth rise, As few may well regard the seas, or scarce behold the Skyes. Some grone and bidde goodnight, their day watch waxeth dimme, Some c? not speake their heads are off, and some haue lost a limme. Some lyes on hatches lame, they haue no legges to stand, And some haue lost the vse of arme, or maymed of a hand. And some are fighting still, and gets no harme at all, But he that speedeth best the while, makes boast thereof but small. These brawles and bloudy broyles to end or quiet brought, A new beginnes, as yll a storme, that troubles more their thought. The Rockes and wretched streights, that they must safely passe, The narrow Creekes &amp; doubts they find in compasse of their glasse, Is daunger wonders great, so that these Saylers toyle, Rests all on hazards, eare they come to any certayne soyle. I could rehearse a heape of sorrowes that they haue, But you that liue in peace at home, and mince the matter braue, Will scarce beleeue a troth, and toyle that trauelers take. Well noble Pilgrims, as in Verse I write this for your sake, In Prose at your returne, looke for a greater prayse, A Booke that to the loftie Skyes, your rare renowne shall rayse. This write I for your friends that you haue left behinde, Your worthy wiues, whose patient hearts beare many things in mind, And sitte and shakes their heads at that they can not mend, And many a sigh and sadde consaite, along the Seas they send, To follow those that flie from them God wot to fast, And carried are in rotten Barkes about with euery blast, And tossed vp and downe the Seas, our Lord knowes where. O Husb?ds wh? you saw your wiues, shedde many a bitter teare, How could you part from them? the cace is aunswerd thus, You are not ruld by loue of babes, nor womens willes yewus. But guided by such grace, as God himselfe hath sent, And that you do, is done indeede vnto a good intent. God graunt you good successe, the whole harts ease you craue, As much of wealth and honor both as euer men may haue. A safe and short returne, not long from home to dwell, A quiet happy iourney still, and so deere friends farewell. FINIS. A welcome home to Master Martin Frobusher, and all those Gentlemen and Souldiers, that haue bene with him this last iourney, in the Countrey called (Meta incognita) whiche welcome was written since this Booke was put to the Printing, and ioyned to the same Booke, for a true testimony of Churchyardes goodwill, for the furtherance of Mayster Frobushers fame. Fiue hundreth times, moste welcome home my friendes that farre haue bin, When thousands thought, that all was loste your fleete came safely in: To glad their harts, that long bewailde your toyle and hazard great: O giue me leaue, in English verse a whyle on this to treat, That doth dezerue, such worldes renowme and come to such good end, As forceth friends to fauour much and foes may well commend. You slouth full snayles, that creepe not far, and loue your shelles so well, And you cold crousts, that haue smal crums in cottage poore that dwell, Now will you blush, or bende the browe, to see how trauelers thryue, Nay, now you ought goe helpe your selues and rather seeke to striue Against ill happe, that holdes you here, when others worke for wealth, And trudge abrode, to lengthen life, and nourish wished health. But adle heades, and idle braynes, and babling tongues, I trowe, Had rather sitte in smokie house (or on the dunghill crowe Like crauen Cockes) than go abrode where Fortune may be founde, And serch where Gold, and Treasure lies in bowels of the grounde. A pecke of drosse, doth more content the base and beggars minde, Than heaped bushels, of good happe, that paynefull toyle doth finde, The thriftlesse will, not let to say, ô giue me ease and rest, A groate in purse, a coate on backe, a homely house and nest, And fie on Fame, and profite both, that c?mes by breake of sleepe, And but vaine pleasures of this world, both harde to winne and keepe. O mizers mindes, and wretches hartes, if all men sought their ease, And none should search out golden mines, nor seeke their gaine by seas, The worlde would sone be at an end, or meate and clothe would fayle, And those that now doe laugh and smyle, at length would weepe and wayle. And all a like, should Lorde and ladde be sette by ery where, The foole and wise man, would be one: and voyde of loue or feare The world should stand; for wealth &amp; wit is that which gouernes all, And makes vs know the mighty forte and shoes the great from small. Jf each man were a like in wealth, as rogues and beggars are, And none had skill, nor great foresight for countreys cause to care, Adeu good rule, and ritches too and farewell vertues prayse: But God be thankt, that we are borne to liue in happier dayes, When wittes will worke for wealths auayle and sundry ryde and runne, Yea hoyse vp sayle, and go themselues as far as shines the sunne Through thick and thin, &amp; feare no foile, as though to their good mindes The Gods had made the lande and Seas, the skies, the ayre and windes, To follow that they haue deuisd that take these toyles in hand. And of late dayes, so great a flocke of these are in this land, That J haue scarce good leysure left, to wryte their names a right, And yeelde the prayse, and liuely lawd is due to eury wight. In deede our age for many things exceedes the season past, And yet some say, all things be old and shall whyles world doth last. But if no new deuise, did helpe the age of that is gone, Full weake and lame would be old toyes these dayes to looke vpon. I graunt the graue, olde sages wise, began to breake the yce, Made smoeth rough ways, set vertue vp, and flatly threw downe vice, Built goodly towres, reard walles aloft, and to be briefe and short, Saylde throwe a world, saw eury creeke and knew each common port, But all they did, hath time reformd or made more perfite still, As cunning came, and new Deuise tooke place from auntient skill. So though our elders trauaylde farre, yea, went the worlde about: Yet many things, our fathers witts, as yet could nere finde out: Whiche they did leaue, to yonger heads, and men of later birth, To search, &amp; see, what hidden wealth, lay lurking deepe in earth: As loe, in (Meta cognita) is knowne, &amp; founde of laet, By those, that through their venture great both golde and glory gaet. O Frobusher, thy brute and name shalbe enrold in bookes, That whosoeuer after c?ms, and on thy labour lookes Shall muse and maruell at thyne actes, and greatnesse of thy minde. J say no more, least some affirme J fanne thy face with winde, I flatter for affections sake: well, God shall witnesse be, In this thy prayse (and other Bookes) I speake but right of thee. A Boke I made, at thy Farewell, in prose (where ere it is) Another for thy Welcome home, thou shalte haue after this, If this mislike thee any whitte. So here mine owne good friend I bid thee welcome once againe, and therewith make an ende.</field>
