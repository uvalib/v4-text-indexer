      <field name="fulltext">There is not a more melancholy object in the learned world, than a man who has written himself down.—In this case—one would wish that his friends and relations would keep him from the use of pen, ink, and paper, if he is not to be reclaimed by some other methods. Addison's Freeholder, No. 40.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS TO Three LADIES, sent with the Book. To the M. H. the ? Lady, whose fair approof I wish should give A glorious sanction to whate'er I write; Since what your well-pois'd judgment marks with white Secure from envy will to ages live; So may I in this arduous emprise thrive, As I not follow in the chase for spite; But led by Love of True, and Fit, and Right, In which good cause each gentle breast should strive: While I with hasard of my own good name Like Calidore pursue the Blatant Beast In dear defense of Ladies' honest fame, Which his foul mouth profanely taints with blame; Let me, howe'er with dread and dangers press'd, Enjoy the smiles of ev'ry virtuous dame. To the R. H. the ? Let him rail on, till ev'ry mouth cry shame; Of his ill word I little reckoning make For Ladies' honor, and for Shakespear's sake; So these I may defend from blot or blame: But ill I bear, that any worthy name Of those, who virtue for their mistress take, And hate the sland'rer like the poisonous snake; Should deem my just reproof deserving blame. Yet, if fair ? speak in my defense, If ?vouchsafe her sanction to my page, If ? sweetly deign to smile applause; Aided by these and conscious innocence, I'll boldly brave the CRITIC's utmost rage; And glory suff'ring in so just a cause. To Miss ? Sweet Modesty, the third of that fair band, Whom virtuous friendship, ill by churls deny'd To Ladies' gentle bosoms, hath ally'd; May I unblam'd your favoring voice demand, While arm'd with Truth's good shield alone I stand In Shakespear's cause determin'd to abide Th' outrageous efforts of insulting pride, And marks of Calumny's detested brand? Deep are the wounds she gives, and hard to heal. Yet though enrag'd her hundred tongues she join With canker'd spite to blast my honest name, I reck not much, nor bate my pious zeal; But to the Fair and Good my cause resign, Who smile on Virtue, and whose smiles are Fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Reverend Mr. WARBURTON. SONNET. [Tongue-doughty Pedant; whose ambitious mind] Tongue-doughty Pedant; whose ambitious mind Prompts thee beyond thy native pitch to soar; And, imp'd with borrow'd plumes of Index-lore, Range through the Vast of Science unconfin'd! Not for Thy wing was such a flight design'd: Know thy own strength, and wise attempt no more; But lowly skim round Error's winding shore, In quest of Paradox from Sense refin'd. Much hast thou written—more than will be read; Then cease from Shakespear thy unhallow'd rage; Nor by a fond o'erweening pride mis-led, Hope fame by injuring the sacred Dead: Know, who would comment well his godlike page, Critic, must have a Heart as well as Head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. SONNET I. To R. Owen Cambridge, Esq; Cambridge, with whom, my pilot and my guide, Pleas'd I have travers'd thy Sabrina's flood; Both where she foams impetuous, soil'd with mud, And where she peaceful rolls her golden tide; Never, O never let ambition's pride, (Too oft pretexed with our Country's good) And tinsell'd pomp, despis'd when understood, Or thirst of wealth thee from her banks divide: Reflect how calmly, like her infant wave, Flows the clear current of a private life; See the wide public stream, by tempests toss'd, Of every changing wind the sport, or slave, Soil'd with corruption, vex'd with party strife, Cover'd with wrecks of peace and honor lost. SONNET II. To John Clerke, Esq; Wisely, O Clerke, enjoy the present hour, “The present hour is all the time we have,” High God the rest has plac'd beyond our power, Consign'd perhaps to grief—or to the grave. Wretched the man, who toils ambition's slave; Who pines for wealth, or sighs for empty fame; Who rolls in pleasures, which the mind deprave, Bought with severe remorse, and guilty shame. Virtue and Knowledge be our better aim; These help us Ill to bear, or teach to shun; Let Friendship chear us with her generous flame, Friendship, the sum of all our joys in one: So shall we live each moment fate has given, How long or short, let us resign to Heaven. SONNET III. To Francis Knollys, Esq; O sprung from Worthies, who with counsils wise Adorn'd and strengthen'd great Elisa's throne, Who yet with virtuous pride mayst well despise To borrow praise from merits not thy own; Oft as I view the monumental stone, Where our lov'd Harrison's cold ashes rest; Musing on joys with him long past and gone, A pleasing sad remembrance fills my breast. Did the sharp pang, we feel for friends deceas'd, Unbated last, we must with anguish die; But Nature bids it's rigor should be eas'd By lenient Time, and strong Necessity; These calm the passions, and subdue the mind, To bear th'appointed lot of human kind. SONNET IV. To Mr. Crusius. Crusius, I hop'd the little Heaven shall spare Of my short day, which flits away so fast, And sickness threats with clouds to over-cast, In social converse oft with thee to share; Ill luck for me, that wayward fate should tear Thee from the haven, thou hadst gain'd at last, Again to try the toils and dangers past, In forein climates, and an hostile air; Yet duteous to thy Country's call attend, Which clames her portion of thy useful years; And back with speed thy course to Britain bend: If, e'er again we meet, perchance should end My dark'ning Eve, Thou'lt pay some friendly tears, Grateful to him, who liv'd and died thy friend. SONNET V. On a FAMILY-PICTURE. When pensive on that Portraiture I gaze, Where my four Brothers round about me stand, And four fair Sisters smile with graces bland, The goodly monument of happier days; And think how soon insatiate Death, who preys On all, has cropp'd the rest with ruthless hand; While only I survive of all that band, Which one chaste bed did to my Father raise; It seems that like a Column left alone, The tottering remnant of some splendid Fane, Scape'd from the fury of the barbarous Gaul, And wasting Time, which has the rest o'erthrown; Amidst our House's ruins I remain Single, unpropp'd, and nodding to my fall. SONNET VI. To John Revett, Esq; Revett, who well hast judg'd the task too hard, Of this short life throughout the total day, To follow glory's false bewitching ray, Through certain toils, uncertain of reward; A Prince's service how should we regard? As service still—though deck'd in livery gay, Disguis'd with titles, gilded o'er with pay, Specious, yet ill to liberty preferr'd. Bounding thy wishes by the golden mean, Nor weakly bartering happiness for shew; Wisely thou'st left the busy bustling scene, Where merit seldom has successful been; In Checquer's shades to taste the joys, that flow From calm retirement, and a mind serene. SONNET VII. To the Honorable Philip Yorke. O Yorke, whom Virtue makes the worthy heir Of Hardwicke's titles, and of Kent's estate; Blest in a Wife, whose beauty, though so rare, Is the lest Grace of all that round her wait; While other Youths, sprung from the Good and Great; In devious paths of pleasure seek their bane, Reckless of wisdom's lore, of birth or state, Meanly debauch'd, or insolently vain; Through Virtue's sacred gate, to Honor's fane You and your fair Associate ceaseless climb, With glorious emulation; sure to gain A meed, shall last beyond the reign of Time: From your example long may Britain see, Degenerate Britain, what the Great should be! SONNET VIII. On the Cantos of SPENSER's Fairy Queen, lost in the Passage from Ireland. Wo worth the man, who in ill hour assay'd To tempt that Western Frith with ventrous keel; And seek what Heav'n, regardful of our weal, Had hid in fogs, and night's eternal shade; Ill-starr'd Hibernia! well art thou appaid For all the woes, which Britain made thee feel By Henry's wrath, and Pembroke's conqu'ring steel; Who sack'd thy Towns, and Castles disarray'd: No longer now with idle sorrow mourn Thy plunder'd wealth, or liberties restrain'd, Nor deem their victories thy loss or shame; Severe revenge on Britain in thy turn, And ample spoils thy treacherous waves obtain'd, Which sunk one half of Spenser's deathless fame. SONNET IX. To the Memory of Mrs. M. Paice. Peace to thy ashes, to thy memory Fame, Fair paragon of merit feminine; In forming whom kind Nature did inshrine A mind angelic in a faultless frame; Through every stage of changing life the same, How did thy bright example ceaseless shine; And every grace with every virtue join, To raise the Virgin's and the Matron's name! In thee Religion, chearful, and serene, Unsour'd by superstition, spleen, or pride, Through all the social offices of life, To shed its genuine influence was seen; This thy chief ornament, thy surest guide, This form'd the Daughter, Parent, Friend, and Wife. SONNET X. To N. Paice, Esq; Brother and Friend, whom Heav'n's all-gracious hand, In lieu of Brethren and of Friends deceas'd, To me a solace and support has rais'd, And bound by Virtue's ever-sacred band; To future times fair shall thy memory stand, (If aught of mine to future times at lest Can reach,) and, for fraternal kindness blest, Wide as good Proculeius' fame expand. The fond remembrance of Maria's love Her friends and kindred to thy heart endears; With equal warmth thou dost their friendship meet, And generous acts thy true affection prove; Thy kind compassion dries the Widows tears, And guides the lonely Orphan's wand'ring Feet. SONNET XI. To the Author of Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul. O Lyttelton, great meed shalt thou receive, Great meed of fame, Thou and thy learn'd Compeer, Who, 'gainst the Sceptic's doubt and Scorner's sneer, Assert those Heav'n-born truths, which you believe; In elder time thus Heroes wont t'atchieve Renown; they held the Faith of Jesus dear, And round their Ivy crown or Laurell'd spear Blush'd not Religion's Olive branch to weave; Thus Ralegh, thus immortal Sidney shone, (Illustrious names!) in great Elisa's days. Nor doubt his promise firm, that such who own In evil times, undaunted, though alone, His glorious truth, such He will crown with praise, And glad agnize before his Father's throne. SONNET XII. To D. Wray, Esq; Wray, whose dear friendship in the dawning years Of undesigning childhood first began, Through youth's gay morn with even tenor ran, My noon conducted, and my evening chears; Rightly dost Thou, in whom combin'd appears Whate'er for public life completes the Man, With active zeal strike out a larger plan; No useless friend to Senators and Peers: Me moderate talents and a small estate Fit for retirement's unambitious shade, Nor envy I who near approach the throne; But joyful see thee mingle with the Great, See thy deserts with due distinction paid, And praise thy lot, contented with my own. SONNET XIII. To the same. Written in a fit of Sickness. Trust me, Dear Wray, not all these three months' pain, Though tedious seems the time in pain to wear, Nor all those restless nights, through which in vain I've sought for kindly sleep to lull my care; Not all those lonely meals, and meagre fare, Unchear'd with converse of a friendly guest; This close confinement, barr'd from wholesome air And exercise, of medicines the best; Have sunk my spirits, or my soul oppress'd: Light are these woes, and easy to be born; If weigh'd with those, which rack'd my tortur'd breast When my fond heart from Amoret was torn: So true that word of Solomon I find— “No pain so grievous as a wounded mind.” SONNET XIV. O sacred Love of Country! purest flame, That wont in Britons' honest hearts to blaze, And fire them to achieve high deeds of praise, Which earn the guerdon of eternal fame; If aught of thee remain, beside the name And semblance vain, to these degenerate days; With all the effulgence of thy heavenly rays Shine forth, and dash the spurious Patriot's clame; That bold bad man, who bellowing in the cause Of truth and virtue, and with fraudful skill Winning the giddy changing multitude, Warps on the wind of popular applause To private wealth and power; pretending still With hard unblushing front the public good. SONNET XV. To the Honorable Charles Yorke. Charles, whom thy Country's voice applauding calls To Philip's honorably vacant seat; With modest pride th' awakening summons meet, And rise to glory in St. Stephen's walls; Nor mean the honor, which thy Youth befalls, Thus early clam'd from thy lov'd learn'd retreat, To guard those sacred Rights, which elevate Britain's free sons above their neighbor thralls: Let Britain, let admiring Europe see In those bright Parts, which yet too close confin'd Shine in the circle of thy friends alone, How sharp the spur of worthy Ancestry, When kindred Virtues fire the generous mind Of Somers' Nephew, and of Hardwicke's Son. SONNET XVI. To Isaac Hawkins Browne, Esq; Hawkins, whose lips the Muses have imbued With all the sweetness of th' Aonian spring; Whom emuling I deftly learn'd to sing, And smoother tune my numbers rough and rude; Truce with the jangling Law's eternal feud, It's subtile quirks, and captious cavilling; Unlike the Muse's gentle whispering, Which leads the Heaven-taught Soul to Fit and Good: Thee more beseems in Eloquence' fair field, The Senate, war with Faction's chiefs to wage, Bare the Mock-Patriot's ill dissembled crime, Nor let fair Truth to feigned seeming yield; With thy sweet Lyre to catch the list'ning Age, And sing thy Trimnell's charms in deathless rhyme. SONNET XVII. To the same. Once more, my Hawkins, I attempt to raise My feeble voice to urge the tuneful song Of that sweet Muse, which to her Country's wrong Or sleeps, or only wakes to Latian lays; Great is the merit, well-deserv'd the praise Of that last Work, where Reasoning just and strong In charming verse thy name shall bear along To learned foreiners, and future days: Yet do not Thou thy native language scorn; In which great Shakespear, Spenser, Milton sang Such strains as may with Greek or Roman vie: This cultivate, raise, polish and adorn; So each fair Maid shall on thy numbers hang, And every Briton bless thy melody. SONNET XVIII. To the Right Honorable the Lord Hardwicke, Lord Chancellor. O thou, to sacred Themis' awful throne, And the chief seat among the crowned Peers, The Nation's last resort, in early years Rais'd by thy high desert; Not this alone, Nor all the Fame thy Eloquence has won, Though Britain's counsils with success it steers, And the rough Scot it's distant thunder fears, Rank Thee so high above comparison, As that prime bliss, by which thy heart is warm'd, Those numerous pledges of thy nuptial bed; Who back reflect a lustre on their Sire, Taught by thy lore, by thy example form'd, With steady steps the ways of glory tread, And to the palm of virtuous praise aspire. SONNET XIX. To his Grace Thomas Archbishop of Canterbury. Prelate, whose steady hand, and watchful eye The sacred vessel of Religion guide, Secure from Superstition's dangerous tide, And fateful Rocks of Infidelity; Think not, in this bad age of obloquy, When Christian virtues Christians dare deride, And worth by Party-zele alone is tried, To 'scape the poison'd shafts of calumny; No—though the tenor of thy blameless life, Like His, whose flock is to thy care consign'd, Be spent in teaching Truth and doing Good; Yet, 'mongst the Sons of Bigotry and Strife, Thou too, like Him, must hear thy Good malign'd, Thy Person slander'd, and thy Truths withstood. SONNET XX. To the Right Honorable the Lord Willoughby of Parham. Parham, if worth concel'd in reason's doom From want of worth be only once remov'd; Nor can those virtues be esteem'd and lov'd, Which listless sleep as in the silent tomb; No longer let thy youthful years consume In shy retirement; Thee long since behov'd, In public life, with courage unreprov'd, To shew those worths, which bloom so fair at home: When Virtue, wanting to herself, will shroud Behind the veil of shameface'd bashfulness Those charms, which Action should produce to view; No wonder if the forward, bold, and loud, In this world's bustling scene, before her press, Usurp her name, and rob her of her due. SONNET XXI. For the Root-House at WREST. Stranger, or guest, whome'er this hallowed grove Shall chance receive, where sweet contentment dwells, Bring here no heart, that with ambition swells, With avarice pines, or burns with lawless love: Vice-tainted Souls will all in vain remove To sylvan shades, and hermits' peaceful cells, In vain will seek retirement's lenient spells, Or hope that bliss, which only good men prove: If heaven-born truth, and sacred virtue's lore, Which chear, adorn, and dignify the mind, Are constant inmates of thy honest breast, If, unrepining at thy neighbor's store, Thou count'st as thine the good of all mankind, Then welcome share the friendly groves of Wrest. SONNET XXII. To the Author of Clarissa. O master of the heart, whose magic skill The close recesses of the Soul can find, Can rouse, becalm, and terrifie the mind, Now melt with pity, now with anguish thrill, Thy moral page while virtuous precepts fill, Warm from the heart, to mend the Age design'd, Wit, strength, truth, decency are all conjoin'd To lead our Youth to Good, and guard from Ill: O long enjoy, what thou so well hast won, The grateful tribute of each honest heart Sincere, nor hackney'd in the ways of men; At each distressful stroke their true tears run, And Nature, unsophisticate by Art, Owns and applauds the labors of thy pen. SONNET XXIII. To the Author of Sir Charles Grandison. Sweet Moralist, whose generous labors tend With ceaseless diligence to guide the mind, In the wild maze of error wandering blind, To Virtue Truth and Honor, glorious end Of glorious toils! vainly would I commend, In numbers worthy of your sense refin'd, This last great work, which leaves all praise behind, And justly styles You Of Mankind the Friend: Pleasure with profit artful while you blend, And now the fancy, now the judgment feed With grateful change, which every passion sways; Numbers, who ne'er to graver lore attend, Caught by the charm, grow virtuous as they read, And lives reform'd shall give you genuine praise. SONNET XXIV. To Miss H. M. Sweet Linnet, who from off the laurel spray, That hangs o'er Spenser's ever-sacred tomb, Pour'st out such notes, as strike the Woodlark dumb, And vie with Philomel's inchanting lay, How shall my verse thy melody repay? If my weak voice could reach the age to come, Like Colin Clout's, thy name should ever bloom Through future times, unconscious of decay: But such frail aid thy merits not require, Thee Polyhymnia, in the roseate bowers Of high Parnassus, 'midst the vocal throng, Shall glad receive, and to her tuneful sire Present; where, crown'd with amaranthine flowers, The raptured choir shall listen to thy song.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the most Honorable the Lady Marchioness Grey. SONNET XXV. The Hermitage at TURRICK to the Root-House at WREST. The Beechen Roots of wood-clad Buckingham To Bedford Elms, their courteous breth'ren, send Health and kind greeting, as from friend to friend, And gladly join to celebrate their fame; Beyond all roots above ground we proclame You happiest, destin'd all your days to spend In Wrests fair groves, and Graia to defend From Eurus' blasts, and Phœbus sultry flame; High Privilege to you, though dead, accorded, Which every living tree with envy views! We envy not, but pray for your stability; Proud, that ourselves by Graia are regarded, At her command we not the fire refuse, But chearful blaze and burn with A cant word used by the Builders of the Root-house. Affability SONNET XXVI. On the Edition of Mr. Pope 's Works with a Commentary and Notes. In evil hour did Pope's declining age, Deceiv'd and dazzled by the tinsel shew Of wordy science and the nauseous flow Of mean officious flatteries, engage Thy venal quill to deck his labor'd page With ribbald nonsense, and permit to strew, Amidst his flowers, the baleful weeds, that grow In th' unbless'd soil of rude and rancorous rage. Yet this the avenging Muse ordained so, When, by his counsil or weak sufferance, To thee were trusted Shakespear's Fame and Fate: She doom'd him down the stream of time to tow Thy soul, dirt-loaded hulk, or sink perchance, Dragg'd to oblivion by the foundering weight. SONNET XXVII. To Mr. Wilson Williams. Friend of my Youth, Companion of my Age, Who saw'st my rising, seest my setting sun, And know'st how fast the trembling minutes run; Which lead me to this life's extremest stage, Great is the power of Med'cine to asswage Those pains, which Nature gives us not to shun, And much divine Philosophy has done, To teach us decently to bear their rage; But there's a Balm, which Art nor Nature knows, A Topic, by Philosophy ne'er taught, Which sheaths th' acutest pains, and bids us smile At Age, at Sickness, and all earthly woes; A Conscience free from ill; a mind well fraught With Faith in Him, who will reward our toil. SONNET XXVIII. To George Onslow, Esq; Good Son of the best Father, whose wise lore And great example join thy breast to warm With generous emulation to perform That arduous task, which He has set before, Mine own George Onslow, oft reflect that more From thee the world expects, than from the swarm Of gay, mistutored youths, who ne'er the charm Of Virtue hear, nor wait at Wisdom's door: View then the pattern with a steadfast eye, By thy great Ancestors from Sire to Son With a religious care transmitted down; Firm to the cause of Truth and Liberty, In their fair steps the race of Glory run, Equal their worth, and equal their renown. SONNET XXIX. To W. Heberden, M. D. O Heberden, whose salutary care Has kindly driven me forth the crouded Town To Turrick, and the lonely Country down, To breathe from Chiltern Hills a purer air, For thousands' sakes may Heaven indulgent spare Long, long thy useful life, and blessings crown Thy healing arts, while well deserv'd renown, With wealth unenvied, waits thy toil and care: And when this grateful heart shall beat no more, (Nor long, I ween, can last my tottering frame, But soon, with me, this mortal coil shall end) Do thou, if Calumny again should roar, Cherish his memory, and protect his fame, Whom thy true worth has made thy faithful friend. SONNET XXX. To the Reverend Mr. Harvy. Harvy, dear Kinsman, who in prime of youth (When Passions rule, or proud Ambition's call Too oft misleads our heedless steps to fall From the fair paths of Virtue, Peace, and Truth,) For erring Souls touch'd with a generous ruth, Did'st vow thy service to the God of All; Anxious to rescue free the captive thrall From the old Serpent's deadly poisonous tooth; Great is the weight, important is the care, Of that high office which thou made'st thy choice; Be strong, be faithful therefore to thy best, Nor pains, nor pray'ers, nor fair example spare; So thou shalt hear at last that chearing voice, “Well done, good Servant, enter into rest.” SONNET XXXI. To the Reverend Mr. Lawry. Lawry, whose blissful lot has plac'd thee near To Wisdom's house, where thou mayst rightly spell Of the best means in Virtue to excell; Science, which never can be priz'd too dear: Where thy Great Patron, though in life severe, Is candid and humane, in doing well Constant and zelous, studious to repell Evil by good, in word and deed sincere: In this fair mirror see thy duty clear, Practice enforcing what his precepts teach; This great example study night and day; If faithful thus thy Christian course thou steer, Though such perfection thou should'st fail to reach, Thy generous effort sure rewards will pay. SONNET XXXII. To the Editor of Mr. Pope's Works. O born in luckless hour, with every Muse And every Grace to foe! what wayward fate Drives thee with fell and unrelenting hate Each choicest work of Genius to abuse? Suffic'd it not with sacrilegious views Great Shakespear's awful shade to violate: And His fair Paradise contaminate, Whom impious Lauder blushes to accuse. Must Pope, thy friend, mistaken hapless bard! (To prove no sprig of laurel e'er can grow Unblasted by thy venom) must he groan, Now daub'd with flattery, now by censure scarr'd, Disguis'd, deform'd, and made the public shew In motley weeds, and colors not his own? SONNET XXXIII. To the Memory of John Hampden, Esq; O Hampden, last of that illustrious line, Which greatly stood in Liberty's dear cause, Zelous to vindicate our trampled laws And rights which Britons never can resign, From the wild clame of impious Right Divine, Then when fell Tyranny with harpy claws Had seiz'd it's prey, and the devouring jaws Of that seven-headed Monster, at whose shrine The Nations bow, threaten'd our swift decay; Neighbor and Friend, farewell—but not with Thee Shall die the record of thy House's fame; Thy grateful Country shall it's praise convey From age to age, and, long as Britain's free, Britons shall boast in Hampden's glorious name. SONNET XXXIV. To Mr. Nathanael Mason. Nephew, who soon design'st to pass the Sea, To fix the basis of a useful trade; With prosperous fortune be thy voyage made, And safe return to home—if not to me; Let these few precepts thy instructers be, In distant climes thy friendless youth to aid; Though interest, fashion, secresy persuade, Yet keep thy morals pure, and conscience free: In change of Countries God's all-seeing eye Is every where the same, Virtue and Vice Change not their nature; therefore be thou ware, Shun follies haunts, and vicious company, Least from true goodness they thy steps entice, And Pleasure coil thee in her dangerous snare. SONNET XXXV. To Mr. J. Paice. Joseph, the worthy Son of worthy Sire, Who well repay'st thy pious parents care To train thee in the ways of Virtue fair, And early with the Love of Truth inspire, What farther can my closing eyes desire To see, but that by wedlock thou repair The waste of death; and raise a virtuous heir To build our House, e'er I in peace retire? Youth is the time for Love: Then choose a Wife, With prudence choose; 'tis Nature's genuine voice; And what she truely dictates must be good; Neglected once that prime, our remnant life Is sour'd, or sadden'd, by an ill-tim'd choice, Or lonely, dull, and friendless solitude. SONNET XXXVI. To the same. “With prudence choose a Wife”—Be thy first care Her Virtue, not confin'd to time or place, Or worn for shew; but on Religion's base Well-founded, easy, free, and debonair, Next rose-cheek'd Modesty, beyond compare The best cosmetic of the Virgin's face; Neatness, which doubles every female grace; And Temper mild, thy joys and griefs to share; Beauty in true proportion rather choose Than color, fit to grace thy social board, Chear thy chaste bed, and honest offspring rear; With these seek Prudence well to guide thy house, Untainted Birth, and, if thy state afford, Do not, when such the prize, for Fortune square. SONNET XXXVII. On the Death of Miss J. M. Young, fair, and good! ah why should young and fair And good be huddled in untimely grave? Must so sweet flower so brief a period have; Just bloom and charm, then fade and disappear? Yet our's the loss, who ill alas can spare The bright example which thy virtues gave; The guerdon thine, whom gracious Heav'n did save From longer trial in this vale of care. Rest then, sweet Saint, in peace and honor rest, While our true tears bedew thy maiden herse; Light lie the earth upon thy lovely breast; And let a grateful heart with grief oppress'd To thy dear memory consecrate this verse; Though all too mean for who deserves the best. SONNET XXXVIII. To? “Sweet is the Love, that comes with willingness:” So sings the sweetest Bard Spenser. that ever sung; Ten thousand blessings on his tuneful tongue, Who felt and plain'd true lovers' sore distress! Sweet were the joys, which once you did possess, When on the yielding Fair one's lips you hung; The sorer now your tender heart is wrung With sad remembrance of her fickleness: Yet let not grief and heart-consuming care Prey on your soul; but let your constant mind Bear up with strength and manly hardiness; Your worth may move a more deserving Fair; And she, that scornful beauty, soon may find, Sharp are the pangs that follow faithlessness. SONNET XXXIX. To Richard Roderick, Esq; Equally skilful or the Lyric string To touch, and laugh in many a jocund lay, Or against vice to rise with bold assay, And Satire's burning brond with art to fling; Roderick, why sleeps the Muse, while jolly spring In frolic dance leads-up the blooming May, And the sweet Nightingales on every spray Take the ear prisoner with their carolling? Or, if thy verse a higher theme demand, Mark the Mock-patriot, deck'd in proud array Of borrow'd virtues, which his soul ne'er knew, Scattering fell poison through the cheated land; And, while to private power he paves his way, Dazzling with public good the blinded crew. SONNET XL. To Shakespear. Shakespear, whose heart-felt scenes shall ever give Instructive pleasure to the listening age; And shine unrival'd on the British stage By native worth and high prerogative; When full of fame Thou did'st retire to live In studious leisure, had thy judgment sage Clear'd-off the rubbish cast on thy fair page By Players or ignorant or forgetive See 2 Henry IV. Act 4.Vol. III. P. 511. Theob. 1st Edit.— O what a sea of idly squander'd ink, What heaps of notes by blundering critics penn'd [The dreams of ignorance in wisdom's guise] Had then been spar'd! nor Knapton then, I think, And honest Draper had been forc'd to send Their dear-bought rheams to cover plums and spice. SONNET XLI. To the Rev. Mr. Shaw, Rector of Beirton. O friend, in sad affliction's useful school Long train'd and tutor'd, hard to humane sense, And dark appear th' awards of Providence, Though Truth and Goodness be their constant rule; The word of Truth has said, and reason cool Subscribes, that wise and kind Omnipotence Does oft the bitter cup in love dispense; While draughts of pleasure lull the prosperous fool: Omniscience knows, and Goodness will bestow, What's rightest, fittest, best; let humble man With faith and patience bow submissive down, Secure, that God delights not in our woe; And, when we have measure'd out this life's short span, If sore the trial, bright will be the crown. SONNET XLII. To Miss ? Sweet are the charms of shamefac'd Modesty, When, coyly shy of well deserv'd applause, She veils her blushing cheek, and meek withdraws From general notice and the public eye; But therefore shall exalted worth still lie Lost in oblivion? This the sacred laws Of Justice, the regard to Virtue's cause, And honor of the lovely Sex deny; Wherefore are giv'n the Muse-inspired lays, The Poet's lofty song, but to rehearse The fair deserts of past or present days, And bashful merit's doubting eye to raise? Ill he deserves the powers of tuneful verse, Who can see Virtue, and forbear to praise. SONNET XLIII. My gracious God, whose kind conducting hand Has steer'd me through this Life's tumultuous sea, From many a rock, and many a tempest free, Which prudence could not shun, nor strength withstand, And brought at length almost in sight of land, That quiet haven where I long to be, Only the streights of Death betwixt, which we Are doom'd to pass, e'er reach the heav'nly strand; Be this short passage boisterous, rough, and rude, Or smooth, and calm—Father, thy Will be done— Support me only in the troublous stour; My sins all pardon'd through my Saviour's blood, Let Faith, and Hope, and Patience still hold on Unshaken, and Joy crown my latest hour! SONNET XLIV. To Matthew Barnard The Sexton of the Parish.. Matthew, whose skilful hand and well-worn spade Shall soon be call'd to make the humble bed, Where I at last shall rest my weary head, And form'd of dust again in dust be laid; Near, but not in the Church of God, be made My clay-cold cell, and near the common tread Of passing friends; when number'd with the dead, We're equal all, and vain distinctions fade: The cowslip, violet, or the pale primrose Perhaps may chance to deck the verdant sweard; Which twisted briar or hasle-bands entwine; Symbols of life's soon fading glories those— Do thou the monumental hillock guard From trampling cattle, and the routing swine. SONNET XLV. To the Right Honorable Mr. Onslow, with the Collection of SONNETS. Thou, who successive in that honor'd Seat Presid'st, the feuds of jarring Chiefs to 'swage, To check the boisterous force of Party rage, Raise modest worth, and guide the high debate; Sometimes retiring from the toils of State, Thou turn'st th' instructive Greek or Roman page, Or what our British Bards of later age In scarce inferior numbers can relate: Amid this feast of mind, when “Fancie's Child,” Sweet Shakespear, raps the Soul to virtuous deed, When Spenser warbling tunes his Doric lays, Or the first Man from Paradise exil'd Great Milton sings; can aught my rustic reed Presume to sound, that may deserve thy praise?</field>
