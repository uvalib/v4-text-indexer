R. 3. 20, pp. 19–25.] Takeþe goode hede, sirs and dames, howe Lydegate daun Iohan þe Munk of Bury, moeued of deuocyioun, haþe translated þe salme Benedic anima mea domino. 1 O þou my soule, gyf laude vn-to þe lord, Benedic anima mea domino &amp; omnia que intra me sunt nomini sancto eius. Blesse him and preyse, and forget him nought. Alle myn entraylles booþe in deed and word, And al þat euer is in myn Inward thought, Gyf thank to hym þat þee so deere haþe bought. Of kyndenes he was no thing to blame, Late serche þyn hert with al þat may be thought, And ofre al vp vn-to his hooly name. 2 And þou my soule, yit blesse him efft ageyne, Benedic anima mea domino &amp; noli oblinisciomnes retribuciones eius. Haue euer in mynde his consolacyons, Be not forgetful, but be truwe and pleyne, Ay to remembre his retribuciouns. To him haue ay þy contemplacyouns, Sith he þee bought with his precyous blood, Be not vnkynde, but in þyne orysouns Thenk for þy saake he starff vpon þe rood, 3 Qui propiciatur omnibus iniquitatibus qui sanat omnes infirmitates tuas.Which is alwey to þine Iniquytees So pacyent ay, and mooste suffrable; Heleþe and rekureþe alle þyne infirmytees Of lordes alle þe moost mercyable, Moost loving eeke, euer oon and not vnstable, Voyde of chaunge and of al doublenesse, God graunt my preyer beo to þee acceptable, Þat schewest to me so muche kyndenesse. 4 Qui redimitur de interitu vitam tuam qui coronat te in misericordia &amp; miseracionibus.For he byeþe euer and makeþe redempcyoun, Þy lyf frome deeth and frome captyvytee: With his blood he made þy raunsoun, And with his mercyes he corowneþe þee, And in his mercyes he gyveþe þee liberte, Whane for þy synne þe feonde doþe þee manace, And condescendeþe of mercyful pytee Ay whan þou axest for to do þee grace. 5 Qui repletur in bonis desiderium tuum renouabitur vt aquile inuentus tua.He accomplissheþe in goodnes þy desyres, He is in loue so stedfast and so trewe. Þyne hert enamoureþe with his goostely fyres, And lyke an Egle þy youþe shal renuwe Elyche fresshe of face and eek of huwe, Cladde with a mantel of Inmortalyte, With-oute appalling, of aage elyke nuwe, With Citeseyns of þyne hevenly Cite. 6 ffaciens miseri ordias domine et iudicium omnibus iniuriam pacientibus.Þowe art þe lord, prophetes doon recorde, Moost renommed of power and of might, Doyng mercy and misericorde, And doome to alle wheche þat souffre vnright. Cast on me lord þy mercyable sight, And graunt me mercy toforne er þat þou deeme, Set pees to-forne &amp; modefye þy right, For of my self I haue nought þee to qweeme. 7 He made hees weyes vn-to Moyses Notas fecitum vias suas moysi filiis Israel voluntates eius. For to be knowe, þe byble can weel telle, His willes also, by vertuous encresce, Vn-to his loued people of Israell, And Pharao þat on hem was so felle Out of his daunger made hem free to goo, So let þy mercy, O lord, þy right precelle, Ageynst þacusing of oure goostly foo. 8 Mercy, lord, on wrecches in distresse, Miserator &amp; misericors dominus longanimis &amp; multum misericors. Which on þy mercy beon ay awayting, With-oute vengeaunce souffrest of goodenesse Synners repent hem, þeyre leyser abyding Moost mercyable þou art in forgyving To suche as beon redy to do penaunce, Nowe graunte me grace, lord, in my lyving Or I passe hennes, to haue ful repentaunce. 9 Þis lord shal not perpetuelly be wrothe, Non in perpetuum irascetur dominus. Nor he shal not eternally manace For mercy euer toforne his right it gooþe, And alle his werkis pacyence dooþe enbrace, And he is redy euer to doo grace Who axeþe mercy, he wil him not forsaake; Þerfore O lord, whane we shal hens passe, To-fore þy doome vs to þy mercy take. 10 After oure synnes þe lord moost gracyous Non secundum pecca nostra facit nobis neque secundum iniquitates nostras. List for noon haast avenged for to be, Nor lyke oure trespasses he is not rygorous To do vengeaunce of his benignyte, Mercy preferring to-forne his equyte; For but his mercy sooþely passed his right— I cane namore, but I seye for me, Whane he shal deeme I durst not come in sight. 11 Quoniam secundum altitudinem.For affter þe hevens heghe altytude Passeþe þe eorþe in comparysoun, He haþe made strong his mercy to conclude On alle þat drede him of truwe affeccyoun. I cleyme mercy and voyde away reysoun, And to his grace lowly me submitte, For vpon mercy stant my saluacion, On which to trist myn hert shal neuer flytte. 12 Quantum distat ortus ab occidente.Als fer in seoþe as þe cleer oryent Is in distaunce whane Phebus shyneþe bright Frome þe west party of þoccydent, Right so þe lord which is moost of might Haþe sette oure synnes asyde out of his sight, His doome delaying þat we may come to grace, Making appeel to mercy frome his right, What synfull ellys durst peer afore his face? 13 Quomodo miseretur filiorum misertus est dominus timentibus se.And as a fader mercyful is founde Vpon his childre for to haue pytee, Right so þe lord of mercy most habounde Is mercyful to alle þat dreedful be, For he allone knoweþe our freeltee, And who of hert can dreed him, loue, and serve; Nowe graunt vs lord, of þy benignytee, Mercy toforne or we þy doome deserue. 14 Recordatus est quoniam puluis sumus.He is Remembred þat we but poudre be, A mannys dayes beon but welked hay, Or lyke a floure ful feyre and fresshe to se Which in feelde faadeþe and goþe awey, For whane beautee is cloosed vnder clay, Fare weel of youþe al þe lustynesse, Which tyme O lord, ne sey not to vs nay To haue mercy vpon oure wrecchednesse. 15 Þe spiryt of man shal soone frome him passe Quoniam spiritus per transibit in illo. Al sodeynly, and no whyle abyde, In þis worlde here no more knowe his place, And fare weel þanne al worldly pompe and pryde, Sette lordship and ricchesse þanne a-syde, Al tresor here nys but transytorye; Wherfore, O lord, let mercy so provyde Þat we wiþ þee may regnen in þy glorye. 16 Þy mercyes, lorde, beon preysed frome eterne, Misericordias autem ab eterno et vsque. Euer lasting, who can beholde and se, Who loueþe þee and can with dreed conserne Þy kyndenessis and þy gret bountee, To alle suche þy mercy is mooste free, And of a mayde thorughe mercy þou were borne, Thorughe whos preyer and humylytee, For lack of mercy ne lat vs nat be lorne. 17 And of þis lord þe gret rightwysnesse, Et iusticia illius in filios filiorum hiis qui seruant testamentum eius. Meynt with his mercy by lyneal discent, Shal sprede to children þat doon hir bysynesse For to obserue of hert his testament, And truly keepe his comaundement, Þeyre issu no mescheef shal encoumbre; Nowe, goode lorde, of feythful truwe entent, Graunt me grace I may beon of þe noumbre. 18 Et memores sunt mandata tua.For þey beon fully, as in þeyre ententys, Of oon hert stable as any stoone, Remembring ay of his comaundementes, For to fulfille hem and forget noon, But hem conserve, what so þey ryde or goon, Now goode lord, moost stedfast and moost kynde, Rent on þe Roode bytwixe Marye and Iohn, To-fore þou deeme vs haue mercy in þy mynde. 19 Dominus in celo.God in his palays above celestyal Haþe bylt a see and a manysoun; And his regne moost Imperyal Haþe ouer al his domynacyoun, And al stant vnder his subieccyoun; Wherfore, O lord, thenk on oure freeltee, And late þy mercy beon oure proteccyoun For oþer saufconduyt haue I noon for me. 20 Benedicite domino omnes angeli.Alle þe Aungelles of euery Ierarchye, Blesseþe þee lord with al your ful might, Mighty of vertu his preceptis to applye, His worde tacomplisshe, as it is skil and right; His voyce, his speeche, herkenyng day and night, By attendaunce aboue þe sterres cleer. Nowe, goode lord, of mercy sheed þy lyght Myn hert tenlumyne þat boughtest me so deer. 21 Benedicite domino omnes virtutes.And alle þe vertues of þee lord also, Gyveþe laude and prys to his magnyfysence And blesseþe him as yee aught to doo, Alle hees mynistres with duwe reuerence, Which þat doon with duwe diligence His wille, his word, and may not disobeye. O lord do mercy ageyne my gret offence, Or cruwel deeþe me sodeynly werrey. 22 Blesseþe þee lord, O yee his werkes alle, Benedicite domino omnia opera eius et omnia.

Here foloweþe an Epistel made by þe same Lidegate sende to Sibille with þeschewing of ydelnesse. 1 The chief gynnyng of grace and of vertue To exclude slouþe is ocupacioun, Martha minystred to our lord Iesu, And Maria by contemplacioun, Þeos boþe tweyne, of clene entencyoun, For to exclude al maner ydelnesse Þeire labour sette in vertuous besynesse. 2 Who is it þat cane nowe fynde suche tweyne, Or of þeire secte one verraily in dede, Whiche þat list in labour do suche peyne, Thorugh diligence longinge to womanhede? By excercyse þeire werkes oute to sheede To gif ensaumple, voyding ydelnesse, How þey in vertue shoulde do þeire besinesse. 3 Þe lavde of hem and þe price goþe ferre As by reporte to many fer cuntree, Labour with vyces of custume holdeþe werre, Where as it falleþe that femyninytee Cawseþe slowþe frome housholdes for to flee, Þat he dar nought have none Interesse To interupte vertuous besinesse. 4 Suche a woman, mayde, widowe, or wyffe, Men shoulde of right comende and magnefye, Namely alle þeo þat beon intentyffe In diligence þeire wittes to applye, For alle suche, I dar wel specefye, Namely wyves bencresce of gret richchesse Gretly delyte in hooly besynesse. 5 An housbande which þat suche one doþe possede May hertly truste in hir governaunce, To robbe or spoyle for he haþe no neode He fyndeþe in hir so muche suffisaunce, Of worldely plentee fulsum habondance, And in hir soule ful goostely gladnesse, Ay moste reioyssing vertuous besynesse. 6 Sheo shal preserve him frome al damage At alle tymes, and of hir gret bountee, With right gode chere and a glad visage Shewe him gret signes of huge humylite; In cloþemakinge sheo shal eke besy be, Wolle and flexsse vn-to hir servant? dresse, Sette hem on werke in vertuous besynesse. 7 Sheo resembleþe a shippe of marchandyse, From ful fare providing hir victayle, With wache also sheo cane aught devyse Þat hir housholde of stuffe shal not fayle. In truwe pourchace ful muche sheo shal avayle, Bigynge in tovne on feelde muche besinesse, Alwey in trouthe vsinge avisynesse. 8 With hir handewerk and hir houswyfrede Sheo besy aye amonge in hir gardynes, Provydence did aye hir brydel lede, Plauntynge amonge hir lousty fressh vynes, Which þat brought forþe delytable vynes Vsinge a girdel aboute hir of clennesse, Her lyff tenbrace in vertuous besinesse. 9 And for sheo saughe þat hir werke was goode Hir clere lanterne shal never qwenche his light, And of hir porte to telle yowe howe it stode; With truwe Lucre concluding vp-on right Hir fingers smale, lyche a truwe maystresse, In silke and weving did hir besynesse. 10 To the poure folke did hir almesdede, Hir armes oute a-fer she gaue to reeche, Of colde in wynter hir meynee thare not dreede, For in suche cas sheo was a prudent leche, Alle hir servantes vertues ay to teche, Were twyes cladde, hem kepinge frome distresse In somer and wynter by hir besynesse. 11 Rayed motleys of divers silke and golde free, Of fyne pourpur was wrought hir garnement, Amiddes þe gates of þat royal cytee Sete hir housbande, so noble and prudent, On trespassours to give his Jugement, With Senatours his doome he can dresse, Refourmynge wronge with vertuous besynesse. 12 Of golde and silke sheo made a ryche cloþe And solde it affter thorughe hir providence, And for þat fame ful far in vertue goþe Sheo made a girdel of gret excellence For to represse þe mighty vyolence Of Canandus wilful wrecchednesse, Sheo brideld hir with vertuous besynesse. 13 Of force, of clennesse, and of honestee, And of fayrrenesse made was hir vesture, Hir to defende in al adversitee Of feyth, of trouþe, shal beo hir armure, And sheo shal love, of entente moste pure, Hir last daye of verray perfytenesse, Deservinge heven by vertuous besynesse. 14 Hir mouþe sheo opunde for to be enspyred With þe grace of goostly sapyence, Þe trouþe of hir was specially desyred Lowe of hir speche, of womanly clemence; And sheo considerd of wit and hye prudence, Of hir housholde þe paþes for to dresse Þat al concluded of vertuous besynesse. 15 In ydelnesse sheo eete not hir bred Her childre aroose and blest did hir calle, And hir housbande prudently toke hede And preysed hir amonge hir folkes alle,— So finally it is now þus byfalle, Thourgh his wisdame and gret avisynesse Sheo al governed by vertuous besynesse. 16 Many doghtren of olde antiquytee Gadred golde, goode, and gret tresore, But sheo surmounted by autoritee, To reken hem alle, by diligent labour, She gate hir price, lawde, and gret honnour, By þat worching of gracious richchesse Shutte in hir coffres by vertuous besynesse. 17 Al worldly besynesse nis but vanytee, Grace of fayresse as a floure doþe fade; Fresshnesse abydeþe in mutabilitee And persinge eyene with þeire lookis glade; Al froyte doþe falle, whane trees beon overlade, And al dooþe waste sauf oonly perfytnesse Slouþe to exclude with vertuous besynesse. 18 But a woman provident in dede, I mene suche one þat prudent is and wyse, Þe whiche of Herte þe lorde above doþe drede, Sheo worþy is to haue a ful gret pryce, For sheo conceyveþe by circumspecte avycc, Whatever sheo doþe and with gret redynesse Texclude slouþe with vertuous besynesse. VERBA FACTORIS. O yee wyves and wydowes moste entiere, And godely maydens yonge and fresshe of face, What ever be sayd as in þis matere, Ful humbully I putt me in youre grace, And remembreþe every houres space Þat moder of vyces is wilful ydelnesse, And grounde of grace is vertuous besynesse. LENVOYE. Go, lytel pistel, and recomande me Vn-to my ladye which cleped is Cybille, Pray hir to haue rouþe and eke pitee Of þe dulnesse of þis my rude style, And as þis dytee doþe also compyle, Let hir labour, avoydyng ydelnesse, Vsinge hir handes in vertuous besynesse. 5. THE PATER NOSTER TRANSLATED. [MS. Trinity Coll. Camb.

To bere hyt esyly þow can vs releue, The fende confusyd with all hys wyles, Helpe vs þy chyldre of Adam &amp; Eue, O Pater noster qui es in celis. 6 Suffre vs nat fall in-to temptacion, Whether hit com of flesshe or fende, Kepe vs from all foule delectacion, For bytternes ys euer þe last ende,— Yeue vs now grace oure lyfe to amende, The fende confusyd with all his wyles, And neuer þy goodnes more to offende, O Pater noster qui es in celis. 7 And whateuer offence ys done before In þought, worde, dede, or countenaunce, For þe furst day þat we were bore, We aske now grace of repentaunce, And here to performe oure dew penaunce, Kepyng oure wyttes and þy hestes ten, And gracious Fadyr take no vengeaunce, Sed libera nos a malo. Amen. 6. A PRAYER IN OLD AGE. [MS. Bodley Hatton 73, leaf 116 to 116 back]. 1 All the trespas of my tender youthe, Wyth grevous gyltes rekenyd of yonge age, Wyth the gode lord make hem not couthe Iesu, till tyme that thy wrath aswage. Myn ignoraunce with insolent outrage, Lyke my deserteys, lord, doo not recorde Tyll pees be leyde, and pitee for ostage, That ryght and mercy may graciousli acord. 2 The myspende tyme of all my mydle yeris, When lust with fors was fresh yn that sesoun, My froward fals foren desires, Wyth many olde diuerse transgressioun, Fer fro vertu, contrarye to resoun,— O lord, late pite thy rygore qveme Or that Iugement do execucioun; Blyssid Iesu! do mercy or thou deme. 3 Duryng that age I coude not aduertyse, Of necligens in my memoriall, By providens to see this straunge gyse, Alle wordely fresshnesse by processe shall appalle; And how fortune amonge hir chaunges alle When folk lest wenyth, her servauntis cast doun; Then is no mene, but to clepe and calle To mercy and grace and Cristes passioun. 4 Forsake me not, lord, in my dayes olde, Whenne febylnesse hath crokyd bak and chyne, Currage and blode appalle, and wexe colde; My blyndnesse, lord, with grace do illumyne, And lat the lyght of mercy ouer me shyne, Or that the rolle be rad of myn outrages: Thy blode, thy passioun, graunt me for a signe, Mercifull Iesu, to patyse my passages. Amen. 7. TE DEUM LAUDAMUS. [MS.

He me supportith in al my nede And to bern vp myn Impotence God is myn helpere, no man I drede. 2 My souereyn trust at hym began, Chees hym to be my cheef socour; In this wourld here I drede no man, Prynce, Kyng, Duke, nor Emperour. For he is the ffyn of my labour, Guerdoun of all myn eternal neede, And fro deeth he was my redemptour, Whyl God lyst helpe no man I dreede. 3 He hath me holpe in many a wyse, And preservyd fro many greet grevaunce, Bet than my-self cowde devyse, Myn hope, myn helpe, my suffisaunce, My soule in virtu for to avaunce. That lord my brydel best may lede, Seying thus withoute varyaunce Whyl God lyst helpe no man I drede. 4 And yif the trouthe be weel conceyved I dar weel seyn, whoo so lyst adverte, Nevir man yit that was disceyved That trustith on hym with al his herte. For which it shall me nevir asterte What wrong that any wyght me bede, For to seyn in al my bittyr smerte, Whyl God lyst helpe no man I drede. 5 I haue been offte in dyvers londys And in many dyvers regiouns, Haue escapyd fro my foois hondys In Citees, Castellys and in touns, Among folk of sundry naciouns Wente ay forth, and took noon hede, I askyd no manere of protecciouns, God was myn helpe agayn al drede. 6 Fals fortune in this wourld here, Whan she semyth moost agreable, Moost blaundysshyng of face and chere, Suych tyme she is moost disceyvable.

AN HOLY MEDYTACION. [MS. Trin. Coll. Camb. R. 3. 20, pp. 111–116.] Nowe here filoweþe an holy medytacion. Affter þe stormy tyme cesing þe rayn, Whane for þabsence of colde þeorþe is fayn, And þe qwyck thinges resceyue þeire vygour, And trees bringen foorþe leeff and flour, And by þe glad lusty sesoun of veer Alle þe thinges, which þat wintour eyr Consumed had by his coldes gret, Releeued weren by þe sonnes heet, And swoote gan to smellen euery mede, Þe briddes eeke, warisshed of hir drede, With lusty herte singing in þeyre greves, Desporting hem amonge þe greene leves, And þat þe dayes gonnen for to lenkeþe And þe cleer wedir, by þe sonnes strenkeþe, Echaced had awey wyntours derknesse By þe beemys of his shyning cleernesse, Þe which sesoun caused men for to be Qwyckest in witt of any tyme, parde, At whiche tyme nuwe mutacyoun To alle grene thinges doþe consolacyoun, And mennes thoughtes dulle in ydelnesse, Ocupieþe and clensiþe by swettnesse,— Of studying, loo, þus hit happend me, Amiddes þis sesoun, lusty for to see, With greuous study annoyed was myn hert, Oute of þe which ne wist I howe tastert, But to þe grenes fast I can me hye, Wening þer to fynde remedye, But al for nought certain it wolde not be; For whane I hade sette me vnder a tree, What for þe floures and þe herbes greene, And noyse of briddes singing ay bytweene In hir wyse me thought crafftely, Þat suche a mirthe neuer noon herde I. Hir song made so myn herte for to accende Þat vnto studye holly I gan attende; And studying enforced I my thought To spirituel thing, and to noon oþer nought: But flesshly lust crepte in myn hert anoon So slelely, þat neghe past was and goon Al my spirituel affeccion, Til oure lord god for my correccion Of his gret might putte þane into my mynde Repreving my flesshe in þis kynde, My soule, I seye, spake þus my flesshe vn-to, If yee wol here, þus he sayde, loo,— “O filthy flesshe þou suget vnto synne Whome foule afeccion haþe his herbarowe Inne, Þy foule delyte and þyne Iniquytee Of vertuous study offten destourbeþe me, Consider of what mater þou art ewrought, And howe þou art into þis worlde ebrought. Of þi conceyving ne wol I not devyse, Ne howe þou art efedde, ne in what wyse. I wol eschuwe it for þyne honeste, Wherfore of þat þou getest nomore of me, But þis I knowe and seye þat at þy birthe Þer nys desport, Ioye, ne no mirthe. Whane þou art borne, anoon þou gynnest wayle, For þou þe way entrest, with-outen fayle, Of wrecched deeth, and whyle þee lasteþe lyf Encreesest ay of woo, annoye, and stryff. And whan þat deeþe whome þou ne mayst astert Þee crepiþe in and takeþe þee by þe hert So greuously, and streyneþ þee so sore, Þat in þis worlde þou lyve mayst no more, Þane forþe-with al þou wexest wormes mete Wheche shoul þy flesshe vn-to þy boones frete. Þane affter þat lord God, Iuge of vs alle, Schal þee and euery wight before him calle At þe day of his steorne Iugement, And deeme þee to ioye or to torment; Weel if þou hast doone, to Ioye eendelesse Of heven, wher is mirthe, rest, and pees, Dwelling with God and with his moder deer, And with his seyntes shyning ful cleer, And also with þe hooly companye, Of þaungelles, wheeche þat maken melodye So delytable and in so goodely wyse Þat þer nys mannes tonge to souffyse, Þoughe þey alle were sette and put in oon And hadde þe konnynges of þe, Omer, echoon, To telle þe mirthe and Ioye is in þat place,— And passing al, þe sight of Crystes face, For it surmounteþe thorughe his dignytee, Al Ioye and mirthe þat may erekened bee. Also bewar nowe on þat oþer syde, Þat if it vnto þy soule so betyde Þat þy desertes deeme it vn-to helle, Þer is such torment shortly for to telle And suche noyse, and showting of feondes blaake, So besying hem ay fyres for to make, Þat alle men whiche haue beon or þis Or yit beon might not þe peyne þer is Descryven of þexcessyf tourmentrye, Ne neuer more shoule þey þer dye, But in þe fuyre brennyng with-owten ende. Beware of þis or þat þou hennes weende, O man! with-stonde þy flesshly freeltee, Lest þat þy soule be lust ymaysterd be; For thing þat to þy flesshe semeþe ful sweete Is bitter to þy soule, I þee byheete. Sith God of his bennigne courtesye Haþe sent þe witt and reson þee to guye, Let not þy flesshly lustes beestyal Vnto þe feonde do make þy soule thral, If þou canst see þyn owen wrecchednesse, Þou hast no mater but of hevynesse, Whyle þou art in þe mutabilitee Of þis wreeched worldes vanytee, Wherfore take heede and pryde þee not, I prey, In flesshly luste, but herken what I sey, Trees bring foorþe, þou wost weel, as I gesse, Branch, leef, and floure, wyn oyle, and suche swettnesse, For þy behooue by Goddes ordeynaunce, For þou him shuldest serve to plesaunce. Shewe foorþe þe fruyt, nowe, man þat comeþe of þee, Howe proufitable and fayre is it? let see: Of þee kemeþe dung, vryne, vomyt and spitting, Lysse, nyttes, flees, and suche filthy thing. If þat þy filthes I reherce shal, Men shal well wit þou art nought worth at al. O filthy man! contrarye of al clennesse, Vessel of dung, heep of rotunnesse, Vessel in whoome þe heete of leecherye Lurkiþe and abydeþe þer til þat þou dye! O wreeched man! ful varyant and vnstable Is þy condicyoun, and right deceyvable, Right nowe þou art, nowe stintest þou to be, Wheþer euer þou fleest deeþe ay wol suwe þee. His cruweltee ne wol no wight spare, For euery man he kaccheþe in his snare. Correcte þee, whyles þou hast tyme and space, And preye to God oure lord, þat of his grace He wol forgyve þee al þy wickednesse, And sende þee might to lyven in clennesse; And þou shalt fynden him so mercyable, Þat þaughe þy gilt be neuer so abhomynable, He of þe digne and worþy excellence Of his mercy wol gif þee indulgence Of alle þy giltes, wher-of I þee rede Þat suche a lorde þou serve and loue and drede. Lat not þy flesshly foule affeccyoun Þy soule putte from his dyleccyoun, Looke þat by raysoun þou so brydelde bee Þat oure lord God ne bee not wroth with þee. Sith God haþe made þee vn-to þe liknesse Of him-self by infynyte goodnesse, And made þee moost worþy creature Þat in þis worlde is while þat it shal dure, And haþ þee gyven gret posessyoun And every thing, heer in þis eorþe adowne, Ordeyneþe oonly for to serven þee, And for noon oþer cause, trust þou me Þane thenke on þis, and be þou not vnkynde To God, which haþe þee þus preferred in kynde. Eschuwe þou þerfore him to displeese For dreed of him, and for þy soules eese. Considre eeke þis, and haue it in memorye, Þat al þis wrecched worldes Ioye and glorye, And mighte of kynges, and hir dignytee, And ooþer lordes mightes, what soo þey bee, For alle hir castelles and hir toures hye And hir possessyouns, yit shal þey dye. Hir goode ne catel ne may hem not avaylle; Cruwel deeþe of his pray wol not faylle. Lifft vp þyn hert vn-to þy God abouve, And think howe þat he dyed for þy love. Howe might he shewe gretter kyndenesse Þane dyen for þy synful wrecchednesse? Looke in þyn hert þer beo contrycon, And by thy mouþ þou make confessyon Of þy trespas, man, whyles þou art here, And satisfaccion þou doo eeke in feere.

Harley 2255, leaves 120–126.] 1 Grounde take in vertu by patriarkys Olde, From Abraham lyneally brought doun In the Scripturys as prophetys tolde, Shewyd to them by Revelacioun On kyng and prophete, moost souereyn of Renoun, Dauid fro Iesse for Royal excellence, Frute of whoos wombe, by Iust successioun, To al the Clausys songe in this sequence 2 May cleyme a title by lyneal discent, How Letabundus to hym doth appartene, By the Hooly Goost moost graciously doun sent In a skye lyk gold dewh, bright and shene, Tenlvmyne that gloryous hevenly queene That bar Iesu, a verray clene mayde; In whoos worshepe this sequence as I mene In hire feestys is songen, as I seyde. 3 Ek in the queer above celestial Querestres gadryd of euery Ierarchye, Out of nyne Ordrys chose in Especial, With ther moost hevenly melodyous Armonye, Wher nubes lucida, the saphir hewyd skye Be-syde Cherubyn, bright brennyng as þe glede, To for themperesse, which is callyd Marye, Synge Letabundus, and Seraphyn indede 4 With Principatus moost Imperial, And Potestates, bright as the sonne beem, To-for that lord, that with his blood bought al, Wher as Chorus nove Ierusalem For ioye of hym, that was born in Bedleem, Sang in excelsis, whos refreyt, to conclude, Was Letabundus, in that hevenly Reem With al the noumbre, and glorious multitude 5 Of hevenly spiritis, with al the Ordrys nyne, To Reioysshe Iuda and Israel, By Royal frute born of Dauid-is lyne, A form figuryd by feithful Samuel;— First book of kynges can the processe tel,— Chorus prophetarum graciously syngyng, To plese the lord Callyd Emanuel With Letabundus, to-for that myghty kyng 6 Which callyd is Kyng of Cristemasse,— I take Record of Isaye,— To glade Reemys, provyncys more and lasse, In his worshepe this Court to magneffye, Be assent of Danyel, Ioel and Ieremye; This mydwyntir glad tydynges hoom to bryng, Alle the prophetys with O voys to yow crye, Letabundus devoutly that ye synge. Regem regum intacte profu[n]dit chorus res miranda. This goostly Chorus figured in the Byble, As prophetys Remembre in ther writynges, —Beheest of God may nat be inpossible,— How Gabriel brought first Tydynges Regem regumThat thilke lord, callyd kyng of kynges, Born of a maide, moost souereyn of degre, With Sceptre and Crowne, former of alle thynges, Cleymyng of right to sitte in Dauid-is se,— 8 His fadir Dauid, of prophetys principal, Wrot longe be-forn by goostly knowlechyng,— That Crist Iesus, lord lastyng eternal, Shal sitte, Crownyd as souereyn lord and kyng. Sedebit rex dominus in eternum. Isayas, his power Remembryng, Seyde and wroot, with fervence set a-fyre, Grace of our lord shal fortune his comyng; Multiplicabitur eius imperium With greet encrees multeplye his empyre. 9 Among alle Cristene prynces and monarkes, Foure and twenty prop[h]etys accordyng, First rekne in Ordre twelve patryarkes, With glad reffreytys there consceytes out shewyng. Was nevir seyn so merveyllous a thyng As for to seen in Abraham-is lyne, A yong Melchisedeck, bysshop, preest and kyng, In Bedleem born of a pure virgyne. 10 Regem Regum this sequence doth hym calle, Set a-syde, make no comparysoun, Isaak, Iacob, Rekne vp kynredys alle, generacionem quis enarrabit. Whoo can Remembre his generacioun? Mathew-is gospel makith mencioun, And concludeth in his Genalogye, Off Letabundus al the perfeccioun Parformyd is in Ioseph and Marie. 11 Doth your deveer in al your best entent, Off verray right, lyk as ye ar bounde, Chorus prophetarum beeyng her present, Goostly considered mysteryes that be founde; Which that doth moost vertuously habounde, Of moralyte conceyved the menyng, On Letabundus your consceyt for to grounde, Regem Regum ffresshly that ye synge. Angelus concilij natus est de virgine sol de stella. This Aungel, callyd the Aungeil of counsayl, Born of a maide be spirit of prophecye, Clenly concevyed, and for our greet avayl By the Hooly Goost to governe vs and guye; This same Aungel, the byble may nat lye, To Tobye sent, whan he was falle in age To lede his sone, callyd also Tobye, Oonly by grace to conduyte his passage. Angelus qui portat claues abissi. Off Abyssi this Aungel bar the keyes, Callid Clauis Dauid to shettyn and vnshette, Whom hevene and helle and al the world obeyes. This same Aungel cam doun to paye our dette; In a pure mayde his Royal throne he sette, Mawgre Sathan and al his mortal werre, Out of whoos dongoun prysonnerys he fette, Lyk a bright sonne that sprang out of a sterre, 14 Out of which sterre our helthe was first gonne, Off the Hooly Goost the Chosen habitacle; Sterre of the se that brought forth a sonne, stella maris Was nevir in erthe noon so greet myracle; Of Salamon aureat tabernacle, Flees of Gedeon, with sylvir dewh moost shene, vellus gedeonis. To all virgines merour and spectacle Off hire merites, of hevene crownyd queene. 15 Off Isaak seed, of Iacob our day sterre, Orietur stella ex iacob Geyn worldly trouble our governeresse, On lond and se, bothe in pees and werre, Our Sauffconduit to kepe vs fro distresse.

Sol occasum nesciens semper clara. Stella semp[er] Rutilans semper clara. Off this bright sonne Iohn in his Apocalyps Seyth nevir Phebus was so cleer shynyng, Weestest nat nor suffryth noon eclyps, Callyd Esperus at Eve the nyght gladyng, Al cloudy skyes dirk mystes avoydyng, Malachias can bern herof witnesse, Cause his bryghtnesse is alwey abydyng He Callyth hym sonne of Ryghtwysnesse, 17 His rightwysnesse abydyng and Eterne, iusticia tua iusticia iusticia in eternum With his moost fervent hevenly bryght beemys, Ther is no torche laumpe nor lanterne May be comparyd to his Celestial streemys, For thorugh the world he launchith out his beemys, Specially his bryghtnesse he doth sprede This hih feeste to alle Crystene Reemys By a prerogatyff that love the lord and drede. 18 Afftir Aurora in the morowe gray Tytan ascendyng out of the Oryent, The Amerous larke massageer of day Hath tydynges brouht froom Est tyl Occident, That alle querestrys of Cristes hool Covent Off Letabundus, lyk as ye haue gonne Sol occasum nesciens in al your best entent This vers tencountre in worshepe of this sonne. Sicut sidus Radum profert Virgo filium pari Forma. So as a sterre shedith out his beemys, Hool and nat lassyd, conservith euere his light, So Maria, queen of alle Reemys, Modir to Iesu, and mayde of verray ryght, Whoos virginite, Euere y-lych bryght, Eclypseth nat, so cleer his beemys sprede, In scripture was nevir so glad a sight As a pure modir to floure in maydenhede. 20 Rekne in Ordre alle sesouns of the yeer, Wynter frostys, snowes whyte and shene, March with his buddys at comyng in of veer, Fressh aprylle, with prymerolles grene, Al stant on chaunge; but this hevenly queene With-oute appallyng conservith hire clernesse; Callyd Stella celi, this pryncesse that I meene, Off hevene and erthe lady and Emperesse. Neque sidus radio. Anothir vers accordyng well her-to, Bothe tweyne to-gidre to Conbyne, That neque sidus ffulgens suo Radio, Lefft nat his light, so this pure virgine Doth Letabundus with gladnesse enlvmyne, On Crystes birthe, as writeth Isaye, O blissed queen! thy light lat on vs shyne, Off worldly trouble voyde euery troubly skye. 22 A sterre is nat voyded of cleernesse Though hys stremys ferre abrood do sprede, Nor Maria of virginal clennesse Though she bar Iesu, flouryng in maydenhede, Abacuk of this matere took hede, Seyde opynly in lawde of his memorye, Hevene and erthe Enlumyned wern in dede, And al the hevenly gloryous consistorye 23 Sang in his laude, by Recoord of scripture, Splendor eius lyk lyght this world shal glade. Splendor eius ut lux erit Bedleem heerdys with sheep in ther pasture Toward mydnyght abraydyng in the shade, Among hem sylf greet Ioye and myrthe made, In Reioysshyng of this sterrys streem, More bright of shynyng, nevir lyk to ffade, Brought out of Calde three kynges to Bedleem. 24 Gloria in excelsis was nat songe in veyn, Song of Aungellys was so delicious, The wyntrys nyght was nat spent in veyn Whoos refreyt was pax in hominibus; And Letabundus, this sequence gloryous, To this feeste accordyng wel also, In whoos worshepe, ye querestrys vertuous, Syng with hool herte neque sidus Radio! Cedrus alta libani. Royal Cedrys, growyng on hih mounteyns, And Cipressys vpon the mount Syon, Knet with Isope In gardynes that be pleyns,— Out of Danyel take out the Angle stoon, Ibid testamenta lapis Angula Two testamentys for to Ioyne in Oon, Of Cedre and Isope tak the morallyte, Lyk as prophetys wrot of yoore agoon, The godheed Ioyned with oure humanyte. 26 The hih Cedre his braunchis lyst enclyne To Recounforte our Infirmyte, Whan the Hooly Goost sent to a pure virgine, Callyd Clennest Ysope that sprang out of Iesse, That al oold figurys of Antiquyte In Letabundus acomplysshed been in dede, Engrossyd vp in the natiuite Off Crist Iesu, this sequence whan ye Rede. 27 Somyr flours, that did in wyntir dare, Lowe in the Roote shewyng no fresshnesse, Braunche, bough and tree &amp; medewes Rude &amp; bare, Whan Marche approcheth, put out ther grennesse. And semblably prophetys ber witnesse, Al that they wrot was curteyned in scripture, Of Cristes comyng was but a lyknesse, The light was cloos, hyd vndir ffigure. 28 Oold shadwes wer torneyd to bryghtnesse, Dyrkyd fygurys Recuryd haue ther lyght, Moyses lawe, veyled with dirknesse, Haue drawe ther curtyn, shewyd a sonne bright. Foure Gospeleerys clareffyed our sight With Letabundus, and the foure doctours Haue maad cleer day, that afforn was nyght, In stede of wyntir shewyd somyr flours. 29 Cedre and Isope be Ioyned in the vale, Cristes birthe hath voyded Oold ffigurys.

Ysaias Cecinit sinagoga. Ysaias song of this matere, The Synagoge put in Remembraunce, Ay contrarye froward of look and chere, Wilfully blynded with ygnoraunce. Prophetys wrote they gaff noon attendaunce, To ther wrytyng they wer so Indurat, Crystes doctryne was to them displesaunce, In ther malys they wer so obstynat.

Considre his comyng and his natiuitie As thow art taught by al Oold prophecie, And as the lettre pleynly techith the Bothe of scripture, Cybile, and Poetrye; Al thyng concludyng vpon Isaye, And fulfilled, tyme of Octavyan, Whan a pure maide, which is callid Marye In Bedleem bar our lord bothe God and man. 37 Thus in worshepe of this hevenly queen That bar Iesu is songyn this sequence, Porely brought forth, his loggyng set a [twene] Asse, Oxe, and Rakke, no costful greet dyspence; Kynges cam doun, did hym Reuerence, Bedleem, be glad, grace is to the falle, Prynce of Iuda of moost magnificence Born in thy boundys besyde an Oxes stalle. 38 O Royal Bedleem!

Laud 683, leaves 81–87.] Here begynneth the Pater noster. 1 Atwyxe dred and tremblyng reuerence Astoned I am, for fer der nat be bold To shewe my face, or comyn in presence Feynt of ffantasyes, dulled many fold, My wit but feble, my memorye dulled for old, To medele of thyng solemply be-gonne; Mak no comparisoun attwixen led and gold, Tween a smal sterre and a mydday sonne. 2 I may be wyllyng and fervent in my desirys, Though for vnkonnyng I dar nat procede, In aysshis olde a lytel ffer there ys Wich yeveth no light nor clernesse at a neede; My torche is queynt, his brihtnesse doth nat procede, Wherfore I sholde pleynly me Excuse, Neer that good hope doth my brydel leede Toward Pernaso, to fynde there som muse, 3 I dar nat calle, nouther of old nor newe, To Euterpe for dytees of plesaunce, That be depict with roial purpil hewe, Rad and recordyd, vertuous of substaunce, Such as calle ageyn to remembraunce Excyte hertys with devout mateerys, In Cryst Iesu to ffynde at suffysaunce As they be tauht by the sevene praieris. 4 In pater noster, breeffly comprehendyd, While he was here, of trouthe it is thus fall, Tauht his discipulis, wich may nat ben amendyd, For it transcendith other prayerys all, Most auctorised, whan we for socour Call, Most celestyall and moost of dygnyte, Crowned among praieris in þe hevenly stall Yif it be said in parfight Charyte. 5 Foure be remembrid, in Especyall, Wich appertene on to this mateer, And been in dede verray Celestyall, Wich passe in Shynyng þe hevenly sterris cleer; And been foure thyngis longyng to prayeer, Lyk as myn auctour maketh mencyoun, But I am dul and clypsed of my cheer To telle what vertu restith in Oysoun. 6 I speke of foure, first in myn avys, Nat of the foure hevenly Gospelerys; Nor of foure floodys that come fro paradys That norisshe al Egypt with ther fressh Reverys; Nor how Ezechiel with his ffoure speerys Callid Quatuor rote wich in al vertu schyne; But of a mater longyng to prayeerys Tauht by Iesu, our rudenesse tenlumyne. 7 I nat remembre of the foure Elementys, Nor of the foure sesouns of the yeer, Of foure complexiouns dyuerse of ententys, Of sonne or mone, why they be dirk or clee; Nor of foure wyndys wich dyuersly appeer, But under support and correccyoun I me submytte to alle that schall now heer This symple processe of my translacyoun. 8 I dar nat speke of foure Cardynall, Fortitudo nor of attemperaunce, Of rightwysnesse oon the pryncipall, Wich al policie set in good gouernaunce, For wich I caste my rudenesse to avaunce So that prudencia lyst to be present, And grace also, thorough Goddys purviaunce, List to prouyde taccomplisshe myn Entent. 9 Malapertnesse and presumpcyoun, With vnfeyned trewe humylyte In despit of ffals ambycyoun I take counsayl of feith, hope, and charyte, Callyd virtutes Theologice To dyrecte my desolacyoun, And on this processe to haue mercy and pite, With favour benygne to do correcyoun. 10 Nat apperteneth on to this partye The foure wheelys, brennyng briht as gleede, That ladde the chaar to paradys of Helye, Nor of Perseus the firy wynged steede, Whos goldene trompe thoruh-out Perce and Mede, To blowe ther trivmphes sent out his bloody souns;— I passe al this, grace shal my penne leede To speke of prayer and sevene peticiouns, 11 The wich sevene, groundid in al vertu, I dar weel seyn, passen alle prayerys, Maad and compiled of our lord Iesu, Most covenable to alle our goostly desirys, Nat withstondyng alle old astronomerys Seyn and conferme in ther phylosophie Soun and mevyng of the nyne Speerys Passe and surmounte al wordly armonye. 12 I haue no mouthe, pleynly to devyse, First to remembre the grete dygnyte, Ferfull to take on me so hih Empryse, Moost celestial, most angelyk of degre, For to the hih myghty Trynyte It is direct, lord of moost puyssaunce, Which callid is oon, two, and thre, Al oon in vertu, and al oon in substaunce. 13 This woord Pater shewith in substaunce His myght ys moost grettest of excellence, Of hevene and erthe hath al the ordenaunce, Callyd welle of grace, myrour of sapience, Wich to his children, of ffadirly providence, Hath yeue a fraunchise aboue fraunchises alle, That we may boldly with devout reuerence Ageyn al myschef to hym for helpe calle. 14 First this woord Pater set us in assuraunce, And this woord Noster geveth us homlynesse, Him to requere, with devout obeysaunce, Remedye geyn al worldly dystresse, So that charite, with hir suster meeknesse, Feith, trust, and hope be with hem present, Than, whan we prei and seyn of feithfulnesse Pater noster, we shal haue our Entent. 15 In this woord Pater stant al our confydence, Our hool beleue whan we seyn Qui es, Our stedefast feith and fully our credence, In heuene abidyng as souereyn lord of pes, Where thre Ierarchies day nor nyght nat ses To crie in celis, with heuenly mellodye, Cherubyn nor Seraphyn nat slouh nor rekles Syngen Osanna with fervent armonye. 16 Whos glorious name for to magneffye Mouth and tonge be lame of ther langage, But the Hooly Goost by grace lyst us guye, Us to enspire in our mortal passage, As goostly children, born of hih parage, Neuer to thyn hihnesse by no mortal offence In this dredful perlous pylgrymage Tyl cleer confessioun our gyltes recompense. 17 We wer renewyd ful nyh to thyn allye By the Hooly Goostys gracious influence, First be baptem, to gynne at that partye, Next confermed be thy magnyfycence, To been accepted to thy benyvolence As chose children to thyn herytage, That we may seyn, with devout reuerence, Lord haue mercy on al our old outrage. 18 Thes sevene peticiouns been of vertu moost, Only to God of hooll herte applyed To the sevene vertues of the Hooly Goost; First whan we seyn thy name be sanctyfyed. Name of alle names halwyd and gloryfyed, As the gospel pleynly doth comaunde,— But her my symplesse with Argus nat cleer eied, Meue this questioun, aske this demaunde, 19 How myhte in us be kyndelyd suych desire, Boldly to seyn conceyued our febylnesse, Though charite in us brente as flawme of fyre, Lyk as in Seraphyn brenneth al parfitnesse? I answere thus, a ground take of meeknesse, Vertu of vertues, doctours sey the same, Vnder support of his paternell goodnesse, To seyn or thynke, Halwyd be thy name, 20 With-oute addicioun to sette our herte at reste That therwithal we haue this sentence, For our party, to conclude for our beste In our Inward goostly Intellygence, First that his name, name of most excellence, With-Inne hym-silf, euery hour and space, Be sanctyfied, so by his provydence It may in us be sanctyfied be his grace. 21 Thy kingdam, lord, enlumyned with thy face, adueniat regnum tuum. Where is ful gladnesse of al goostly lyght Mot come to us, tyme set and space, Whan thow assignest be thyn eternal myht, Of thy presence that we may haue a sight; O gracious lord, our tyme so provyde Cleymed with meknesse, of mercy more than riht, Mene of thy passioun that we may there abyde. 22 Thy kingdam, lord, first in this present lyf Come to us, to rewle us and gouerne Geyn the assautys and the treble stryf Of our enmyes, lord, hold so the lanterne By thy grace, which that is Eterne, Regne so in us, of resoun hold so our brydell, y Tween good and evell we may so dyscerne Geyn thy plesaunce, to do no thyng in Idell. 23 Lord, by thy mercy regne in us so heere, Of alle vices we may haue victorye, To cleyme a title aboue the sterris cleere, Thy passioun cheef set first in memorye With the to regne in thyn eternall glorie, Axed by bille, wreten with thy precious blood, For folk alyve, and folk in purgatorye, Doosed and asseled at Calvary on the rood. 24 So as thy will fulfelled is in hevene, Right so in erthe fulfellyd mot it be, Lyk as the court aboue the sterrys sevene Of ordrys nyne and Ierarchies thre Syngen sanctus thries to-for the Trynyte, So make us lord, with devout observaunce Day and nyht knelyng on our kne, Thy deth, thy passioun, to haue in remembraunce. 25 First thy preceptys and ten comaundementis We may fulfylle, attwixen hoope and dreede, And for-sake with al our hooll ententys Al that sholde dysplese the in deede.

Suffre thy mercy so vp-on us spreede, Part to receyue, that thow gaf at thy mawnde 26 To thy dyscyplys for a memoryall, For a perpetuall commemoracyoun, Of thy flessh and thy blood, take in especiall, Of a pure maydyn thyn Incarnacioun, Thy meek suffraunce for our Redempcioun, With mynde also thow lyst for us be ded, That we may cleyme for our savacioun Receyve thy boody among in forme of bred; panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie. 27 That we dar seyn, with al humylyte, Vnder the wynges of thy proteccyoun, Panem nostrum da nobis hodie, Knoden afforn Pilat, baken in thy passioun, Our dayly bred, our Restauracioun, Our foode, our manna, geyn fendis violence, Strong with Helias, Bible maketh mencyoun, To mount Oreb, to haue there residence. 28 This bred of lyf yeveth us force and myht Geyn goostly enmyes, whan they wolde assayll, Helthe of the sowle, our boody strong in fight, With spiritis infernall to holden a batayll, Sathan abitt nat, for all his apparayll, Wher this bred is sacred with Crystis mouth, Clenly receyved, the ffend may nat avayll, So gret vertu this bred hath est and south. 29 This bred of angelis, bred celestyall, Bred that excelleth resoun and nature, Callid bred of lyf, and repast eternall, Yeueth lyf ay-lastyng and euer shal endure; Most comended by prophetis in Scripture, To sowle and boody bred of moost comfort, Folk in siknesse, this bred doth hem recure, To pore pilgrymes restoratyf and support. 30 In this peticioun, O lord, do us socoure, First consydryng our ffragylyte, For-yeve our dettys as we for-yeve oure, Above al thyng to love and drede the, Next our neihebour in parfit charite, First deme my-silf werst of any man, Void of presumpcioun, bowyng doun my kne, And to remembre vp-on the publican, 31 Durst nat lefft vp his eie vp to the hevene, To looke up ferful on-to the sonne streem; And I am soyled with the synnes sevene, Can In myn eien nat seen a large beem, Though it spradde al abrood this Rewm, Can seen weell motys in other menhis sight, A smal sparck, that casteth out no beem, Blent in my fauhtys thouh torchis wer cler light. 32 This to seyne, I can be weell vengable, Et dimitte nobis debita nostra.

The slynge, the stoonys, v. woundys did expresse, Off the iij nayles, the spere deep persyng: Which to remembre, Iesu our hertys dresse, That we thy Mercies eternally may syng. 4 Than was his song, the sawter tellith thus, In signe of victory, the stoory who can reede, Benedictus dominus meus. Conquest of Dauid famous in length &amp; breede! Ther is no tryumphe in knyhtood nor manheede, Marcial sheltrouns, nor baners brood splayeng; Which thyng remembryng, lord, I am bounde in deede, Eternally thy Mercies for to syng. 5 Ther be Canticulis of Conquest and victorye That be songe at feestis marcial, And ther be songis of palmys transitorye, With corious meetrys that be poetical; Laureat tryvmphes, proud and Imperial, With boosty blowe in charys cleer shynyng, Al this left off, with voys memoryal, Eternally thy Mercies I shal syng. 6 Virgile sang the Conquest of Enee, Dites Grec, of Hercules and Iason, Frigius Dares sang in ther Cite Prowesse of Ector, the Troian champioun: Lucan of Iulius made gret boost and sown, Slayn by the Senat, thempyre vsurpyng; Set al asyde, make no comparisoun, Eternally thy mercies I shal syng. 7 Off Alisaundre clerkys synge and reede, Afftir his Conquest slayn in Babilon; Men synge of Cresus, kyng of Perce and Meede, Of Hanybal and the gret Scipioun, Of Adrastus and Agamenoun; Alle set a-bak, and fully remembryng Of hym that made our redempcioun, Eternally his Mercies I shal syng. 8 Gret boost is maad,—but as for me no fors,— Bildyng of Ylioun in many stoory told; Getyng of Troye by the brasen hors; Of bolys, serpentys, that kept the flees of gold; Of Belleferon, that was so proud and bold, And cam to nouht, ther storyes rehersyng; But of Iesu, as I am bounde and hold, Eternally his Mercies I shal syng. 9 At funeral feestys men synge tragedies With wooful ditees of lamentacioun; In thorpys smale be songe Comedies With many vnkouth transmutacioun; Ech man folwyng oppynyoun, Somme in reioisshyng, somme in compleynyng; But for moost sovereyn consolacioun Eternally thy mercies I shal syng. 10 The Musis nyne sang the weddyng song Of Mercurye And Philologye. Thebes the Cite was reysed and maad strong By touch of harpe and sugryd melodye, As Oold Stace saide in his Poetrye; But what so evir they wroot in ther feynyng, Our lord Iesu to preise and magneffye Eternally his Mercies I shal syng. 11 Circes whiloom, the gret enchaunteresse, With song and drynk made folkys bestial, And Syrenes with warblys of swetnesse, And with ther sugryd tvnys Musical, Blente ther resouns and ther memorial; Made hem vnwarly fal in a slombryng, But for to preise hym that is Immortal Eternaly his Mercies I shal syng. 12 Many Canticles in hooly writ be founde, Write and entitled for sovereyn remembraunce,— Children of Israel that were in thraldam bounde Vndir Pharaoo by many gret grevaunce, By myracle accomplisshid ther penaunce, With drye feet the rede see passyng They sang Cantemus, but now for my plesaunce Eternally thy Mercies I shal syng. 13 In Iudicum, the woman Delbora Sang a Canticle, Genesis tellith soo, Thankyng the lord by-cause Sisara Distroyed was, that did so gret woo,— To Goddys peple he was a mortal foo,— Qui sponte optulistis, was of hir song gynnyng, Takyng exaumple, wher evir I ride or goo, Eternally thy Mercies I shal syng. 14 The firste Canticle remembryd in Regum Was maad by Anna, moodir of Samuel, Which began thus, Exultauit cor meum, Ageyns hire whan Hely was so fel; Hyr preyer herd, hooly writt can tel In what wise she maad hir offryng. Thynkyng on Iacob and on Israel Eternally thy Mercies I shal syng. 15 Duke Moises, Israel tenlumyne, Audite celi he sang, as it was riht; Fluat ut ros, or reyn spred his doctryne, And as deuh dropys verray silvir briht Fallith on the greyn on morwenys aftir nyht, He tauhte his peeple at his departyng To love ther lord, with boody, hert, and myht, Eternally his Mercies for to syng. 16 Amyd the ffires the Innocentys thre Ananye, Misael, and with hem Azarye Sang the Canticle Benedicite; No flawme of fyr men myht in hem aspye. Ilich fressh with heuenly Armonye Sang lyk Angelys, the fyr nat hem harmyng; Now al the heuene with sugryd melodye Eternally thy Mercies they do syng. 17 Off Betulia the peeple was maad fayn By cause they wer delyueryd out of dreed, Whan the Tyraunt Olofern was slayn By prudent Iudith, flowryng in womanheed; Canticles songe for hir Conquest in deed, Thankynges youe, for hir discret werkyng: But hym to preyse that for vs list &amp; blede, Eternally his Mercies I shal syng. 18 Isaias, for conclusioun, To save the peeple from adversite Of ful meeke herte, by contemplacioun, Sang Confitebor tibi domine; And Iudith eft, by gret hvmylite, Gan Cantate, the peeple confortynge Geyn ther Enmyes furyous cruelte; But I thy mercies eternally shal synge. 19 Dauid remembrith of a Pellican Figure of Crist which in seyntuarye Offryd his blood for the lyf of man; To whom the Iewes of malys were contrarye; And he was callyd passer solitarye, Moost paciently his passioun suffryng. On hym remembryng, God graunt that I nat varye, Eternally his Mercies for to syng. 20 The noble kyng, callyd Ezechie, Sang Ego dixi, restoryd fro syknesse; Benedictus made Zacharie, And Symeon with ful devout swetnesse Sang Nunc Dimittis, with ful devout gladnesse Withinne the temple at Cristes presentyng. And now with Iesu this Symeon, in sothnesse, Eternally his Mercies he doth syng. 21 Abacuk, that brouht the potage To Danyel lyeng in prisoun, Off hool herte and deuout corage Domine Audiui was his Orisoun, In exitu Israel, canticle of gret renoun, Sang Israel, Iordan his cours tornyng. Now blised Iesu, lyk our affeccioun Graunt we thy Mercies eternally may syng. 22 Vpon a mounteyn beside Nazareth, Fro Dauid-is lyne, cheef braunche of Iesse, Sang Magnificat meetyng Elizabeth, With goostly gladnesse, blyssed mot she be! Cheef examplayre of virginite, Socour to man, our damages refourmyng.

Wives, widwis, maidnys with ther floures Synge Osanna in the heuenly cristal toures, Wher evir is ioye and brihtnesse ay lastyng. Now graunt vs, Iesu, out of al mortal shoures That we thy Mercies eternally may syng. 24 Moost gracious song to syng in every Reem Ecce quam bonum, whan brethren been al oon, Synge to-gidre Lauda Ierusaleem, Preyse of hool herte Deum tuum Syon; With thre Ierarchyes and angelis euerychon Syng Sanctus Sanctus, there hedis enclynyng, In feith, hoope and Charite, stable as a stoon, Eternally thy mercyes they do syng.

II The Secunde day, the se shal ek discende That vnnethe it shal nat wel be seyn. Wilde beestys vpon the flood Rorende, IIIThe thridde day herd on mount and pleyn, Foul, beeste and fyssh, shal tremble in certeyn, Compleynyng in ther hydous moone Vp the skyes; this noyse nat maad in veyn, For what they mene, God shal knowe alloone. IV The Fourthe day, the watir and the see Shal brenne as only flawme light. VThe fiffte day, herbe, foul and tree Shal be bloody dewed to the sight; And alle foulys for feer shal take ther flight, As they were echoon of assent Nouthir Ete nor drynke, but lese strength &amp; myght, Oonly for feer of Cristes Iugement.

XI The xj? signe, pleynly to devise, As it is Remembrid in scripture, Ded boonys that day shal aryse, And grisly stonde on ther sepulture, And shewyn outward a dredful foul figure; So to stonde al day, with boonys blak and donne; Of doom abyde the dredful aventure, Tyl goyng doun of the bloody sonne.

And howe he is protectour and patroun, Þis hooly martir, of knighthood loodsterre, To Englisshe men booþe in pees and werre. 2 In whos honnour siþen goon ful yoore Þe thridde Edward of knighthoode moost entier In his tyme, bassent at Wyndesore Founded þordre first &amp;

And in his youþe he gaf him-self delyte Frome day to day, as Clerkis of him wryte, To suwe vertue, so gynnyng his passage, Vyces excluding, al Ryot, and oultrage. 5 And Cristes feyth for to magnefye At gretter age his cuntree he forsooke, And thoroughe his noblesse and his chyuallerye Trouthe to sousteene, who-so list to looke, Many a Iournee he vpon him tooke, Þe chirche defending with swerd of equytee, Þe Right of wydowes, and of virgynytee. 6 And in þis whyle an aventure is falle, Importable þe people to sousteene, Amiddes þe provynce whiche men lybye calle, In a Cytee þat named is Lysseene; A gret dragoun, with scales siluer sheene, Horryble, dreedful, and monstruous of sight, To-fore þe Citee lay booþe day and night. 7 Þe kyng, þe queene, þe lordes taken heed Of þis sodeyne wooful aventure, And þe people fellen in gret dreed Consydering howe þat þey stonde vnsure, As þey þat might þe mescheef not endure Maade by assaute of þat felle dragoun By pestylence vpon þeyre wooful toun. 8 But whane þe counseyle of þeyre toun took keep Howe þat þeyre peyne was Intollerable, Þey senten out euery day twoo sheep To þis beest foule and abhomynable, To staunche his hunger whiche was vnstauncheable, But whane þeyre sheep by processe gan to fayle Þey most of nuwe provyde more victaylle, 9 And whanne þey foonde no Refuyt ne coumfort For þe dragoun to make pourveyaunce, Þane þey tooke by lotte oþer by soort Man or chylde, þeyre vytayle to avaunce, Lyche as hit felle on by mortal chaunce Allas, ellas, it was to gret pytee To seen þe sorowe þat was in þat Citee. 10 Þe statuit made noon excepcyoun Of heghe ne lowe, þey stoode in so gret doute Touchant þat monstre and þat foule dragoun, Eche maner man, as it came aboute, To be devoured, allas, þey were sent oute, Til at þe last þe lott in þis maner Fel right vpon þe kynges doughter deer, 11 Þat sche most nexst of necessytee Beo so deuowred, helpe may no meede, But to beo sent oute of þat cytee, Þis cely mayde quakyng in hir dreed; Vpon hir hande a sheep she did leed, Hir fadir wepte, hir moder, booþe tweyne, And al þe Cytee in teerys did so reyne. 12 At hir oute goyng hir fader for þe noones Arrayed her with al his ful might In clooþe of golde with gemys and with stoones, Which shoone ful sheene ageyne þe sonne bright, And on hir wey sheo mette an armed knight Sent frome þe lord as in hir diffence Ageynst þe dragoun to make resistence. 13 Saint George it was, oure ladyes owen knyght, Þat armed seet vpon a ryal steed Which came to socour þis mayden in hir right, Of aventure in þis grete neode, “Ellas!” quod she, whane she takeþe heed, And bade him fleen in hir mortal feer, Lest he also with hir devowred were. 14 And whane he saughe of hir þe maner, He hadde pytee and eeke compassyoun, To seen, allas, þe cristal streemys cleer On hir cheekys reyne and royle adowne, Thought he wolde beon hir Chaumpyoun, For lyff nor deeth frome hir not to depart But in hir quarell his body to Iupart. 15 Hooly Saint George his hors smote on þe syde Whane he þe dragoun sawe lyfft vp his hede, And towardes him he proudely gan to ryde Ful lyche a knight with outen fere or dreede; Avysyly of witt he tooke goode heed, With his spere sharp and kene egrounde Thoroughe þe body he gaf þe feonde a wownde. 16 Þe cely mayde, knelyng on hir kne, Vn to hir goddes maked hir preyer, And Saint George, whane he did it see, To hir he sayde, with debonayre cheer, “Ryse vp anoon, myn owen doughter deer, Take þy girdell, and make þer-of a bande, And leed þis dragoun boldly in þyn hande 17 In to þe cyte, lyche a conqueresse, And þe dragoun meekly shall obeye.” And to þe cytee anoon she gan hir dresse— Þe Ouggely monstre dourst it not withseye— And Saint George þe mayden gan conveye, Þat whane þe kyng hade Inspeccyoun, With palme and banner he gooþe processyoun, 18 Yiving to him þe laude of þis victorye, Which haþe þeyre cytee delyverd out of dreed; And Saint George, to encresce his glorye, Pulled out a swerde and smote of his hed, Þe people alwey taking ful good heed, How God þis martyr list to magnefye, And him to enhaunce thorughe his Chiuallerye. 19 Þanne he made þe dragoun to be drawe, With waynes and cartes fer out of þe towne, And affter þat he taught hem Crystes lawe, By his doctryne and predicacyoun, And frome þerrour by conuersyoun, He made hem tourne, þe kyng and þe cyte, And of oon hert baptysed for to be. 20 Þe kyng affter in honnour of Marye And in worship of Saint George hir knight, A ful feyre chirche gan to edefye, Riche of bylding and wonder feyre of sight, Amiddes of which þer sprang vp anoon right A plesaunt welle, with stremys cristallyne, Whos drynk to seek was helthe and medecyne. 21 Saint George þanne enfourme gan þe kyng Of foure thinges of great excellence, First þat he shoulde aboue al oþer thing Crystes chirche haue euer in reuerence, Worship preesthood with al his diligence, Haue mynde on poore, and first his hert enclyne Frome day to day to here servyce devyne. 22 Þis same tyme, þe stoory telle cane, Ageynst Crysten þer was a thyrant sent, Þe which was called þeo-Dacyan, Of paynyme lawe he was a presydent, And to destroye was hooly his entent Þe feyth of Cryst, and sleen his confessours, With dyuers peynes wrought by his tormentours. 23 Whane þat Saint George gan here of take heed Howe þis thyraunt gan Crystes feyth manace, He of pourpos lefft of his knightly weede, And pourely cladde mette him in þe face, Mannely cheered, fulfilled al with grace, In his presence lowde he gan to crye “Oon God þer is, fy on ydolatrye.” 24 Þe false Thyraunt by gret vyolence Commaunded haþe anoon þat he be taake, And to be brought vnto his presence; Bade þat he shoulde Crystes feyth forsake, But he ne liste noo delayes maake, Aunswerd pleynly, his lyff by deth to fyne, Frome Crystes lawe no thing shall him declyne. 25 Þe Thyraunt þanne, of verray cruweltee, Bad þat he shoulde þis martir moost entier Naked beon hanged vpon a galowe tree, With scowrges beet in ful felle maner, And with brondes brennyng bright and cler, His sides brent, were not hes peynes strong? His entraylles opende, salt cast in among. 26 Þe nexst night, Cryst to him did peere, And gracyously gan him to coumfort, And beed him souffre his peynes with goode cheer, And in no wyse him-selven discoumfort, For he þe palme of victor schal report, By his souffraunce, and wynnen þe laurier Of martirdame aboue þe sterres cleer. 27 Þis mighty Geaunt, Crystes Chaumpyoun, Drank bitter venyme made benchauntement, Crystes crosse was his proteccion, Preserving him þat he was not shent, And he þat made hit of ful fals entent Saughe ageyne God he hade no puissaunce, Forsooke his errour and fel In repentaunce. 28 Axeþe mercy in ful humble wyse, And bycame cristen, bytwix hope and dreed, Þe false Iuge, voyde of all Iustyce, Comaunded haþe þat he shuld leese his heed, And in his blood, as any roose reed, He was baptysed, whoo þat can discerne, By deeþe deserving þe lyff þat is eterne. 29 Þanne Dacyan, furyous and cruwel, Gane of nuwe devysen in his teene, Reysed alofft a ful large wheele, Ful of swerdes grounden sharp and keene, And Saint George, in his entent moost cleene, Tourned þer on in þat mortal rage, Þe wheel to braake he felt no damage. 30 Eeke in a vessel boylling ful of leed, Þis hooly martir was eplounged downe, He enterd In with-outen feer or dreed, Þe grace of God was his saluacioun, [And liche a bath of consolacioun] He founde the metal coumfortable and clere, Escaping oute devoyde of al daunger. 31 He was eeke brought, þe story dooþe devyse, In-to a temple ful of mawmetrye, Off entent to haue doo sacrefyce, But alle þeyre goddes he knightly can defye, And sodyenly oure feyth to magnefye A fyre frome heven was by myracle sent, Wher thorughe þe temple was till asshes brent. 32 And with al þis we fynden in his lyff, Thorugh Goddes might and gracyous purveyaunce Þat Alexandrea of Dacyan þe wyff Forsooke ydolles and al hir fals creaunce And became crysten with humble attendaunce, Suffred deeþe baptysed in hir bloode For loue of him þat starff vpon þe Roode. 33 And Dacyan þanne, by ful mortal lawe, Comaunded haþe in open audyence, Þat Saint George be thorughe þe cyte drawe And affter þat þis was his sentence, [He to ben heueded by cruwel violence], And in his dying þus it is befalle, He made his preyer for hem þat to him calle. 34 “O lord,” quod he, “þou here myn orysoun And graunte it beo vn-to þe plesaunce Þat alle folk þat haue deuocyoun To me, O lord, haue hem in Remembraunce And condescende with euery circumstaunce Of þy mercy, O souerein lord moost deer Al for my saake to heren þeyre preyer.” 35 And al þe peple being in presence, A voyce was herd dovne from þe hye heven, Howe þat his preyer was graunted in sentence Of him þat is lord of þe sterres seven.

[Reprinted from “Fugitive tracts:” I, First Series, from an early Pynson print.] 1 The parfite life to put in remembraunce Of a virgyn moost gracious and entere, Which in all vertu had souereyn suffysaunce, Callyd Petronylla Petyrs doughter dere, Benygne of porte, humble of face and chere, All other maydyns excelled in fairenesse, And, as hir legende pleynly doth vs lere, Though she were fayre more commendyd for meknes. 2 And more-ouer, as hir story sayth, By Petyrs doctryne and informacion, In Crystis lawe and stable in that feyth She was so groundyd, for short conclusion, Called the clere myrroure of all perfection, For good exaumple, by Goodys prouidence Preuyd in sekenesse, hir lyf maketh mencion, In all hir sekenesse had parfyte pacience. 3 Though she had of brennynge greate feruence Twene colde and hote, vexacion inportable, There was no grutchinge, but vertuous Innocence, Gaue thanke to God, of hert and thought most stable, From hir entent nat found variable,— So was she groundyd on parfyte charite,— Professyd to God to perseuere immutable, In hir auough made vnto chastyte. 4 Hir perfection breuely to discryue, She was acceptyd so in the lordys sight, To be noumbryd one of the maydyns fyue Afore Ihesu that bare their laumpys light, Which may nat clipse no derkenesse of the night, But euer Ilych abydinge in vertue, This Petronylla might cleyme of very right To hir spouse oure blessyd lord Iesu. 5 And as hir lyfe recordeth by scripture Of this virgyn by myracles full notable, It fyll onys of sodeyne auenture, Petyr sittinge sadly at the table With his disciples, such as were moost able In all vertue, Titus did abrayde And of compassion with langage resonable To Saynt Petyr euyn thus he sayde,— 6 “With humble support of youre audience, Peysed youre power and youre holynesse, What may this mene, concludynge my sentence, That ye make hole all theym that haue sekenesse, And Petronella quaketh in hir accesse, Youre owne doughter in full pitous wise, And ye alas hir langoure to represse, Lyst nat onys byd[den] hir arise?” 7 Saynt Petyr thanne, of faderly pyte Bad hir arise, and serue theym at the table, And she all hole of hir infirmyte, He gaue hir charge to be seruysable; She lyke a virgyn, of port moost agreable, What euer he bad she alwey diligent Of humble wyll, by tokenes moost notable, Lowly to accomplissh his commaundement. 8 And she fulfylled his byddynge, in certeyn, Withoute grutchinge, of virgynall mekenesse, Petyr bad hir goo into hir bed ageyn Lyke as toforne, brennynge in hir sekenesse, For Cristes sake, she dempt it for rightwysnesse, And of humylite, groundyd in all vertue, Hir maladye was to hir a gladnesse, All that she felt for loue of Crist Ihesu. 9 On whom alone she dyd hir hert[e] grounde, Withoute chaunge or foreyn doublenesse, In hir prayers she was so stable founde, Folke that were seke their langoure to represse, And as hir life can truly bere wytnesse, Her inwarde herte so brent in charyte, Though God and nature gaue hir great fayrenesse, Yit more commendyd was hir humylite. 10 A pure virgyn perseuered all hir lyfe Both for condicions and great semelynesse. The Erle Flaccus desired hir to his wyf, Cam and requeryd hir, did his besynesse, For hir port and womanly noblesse, Hir demenynge and gracious visage, Albe that he excellyd in richesse, He besy was to haue hir in mariage. 11 To yeue answere she was nat recheles, But alwey one of thought and [of] corage Toke him asyde, oute of all the prees, Benygnely and demure of langage, Gaue answere for hir auauntage That he shulde the day of hir weddynge Bringe matronys, wyues, maydyns yonge of age, Hir to conuey vnto his dw[e]llinge. 12 He gan reioyse Flaccus anone right In his inwarde hertly aduertence, Lyke hir request, this Erle, this proude knight Made him redy to come to hir presence; She all this while lay in abstynence In prayer wakynge, this virgyn vertuous, With Fellicula moost preuy in sentence Of hir secnees, brought forth in one hour. 13 Of Petronylla thus it is concludyd, Who so list her lyfe playnly to rede, Of his purpos Flaccus was deludyd, And by a preest callyd holy Nychomede Brought to hir couch and lyenge there bedrede, As God list for her graciously to wurch, With hosyll, shrift, yeldyd vp hir goost in dede, A parfite mayde preuyd of all holy church. 14 Fellicula gan afore prouyde Maugre Flaccus to lyue in maydynhede, His loue, his hate, both she set asyde, Lyued vii dayes metles in dede, Slayne by this tyraunt, which made hir sides blede, Lyke rede roses ran doun hir chast blode, And after that he slough Nychomede, Last by despite at Tybre in the flode. 15 Their martyrdome they dyd thus fulfyll, With rosys rubyfyed complete their passyon, With white lyllyes was holy Petronylle Magnefied for chast affection, Saynt Petyrs doughter, hir lif maketh mencion, Exsaumple of pacience in sekenes whan she lay, With purple wede to the heuenly mancyon Hir soule went vp the last day of May. 16 Which is a seson playnly of the yere That all foulys make melodye, And nightyngalys with amerous notys clere Salueth Esperus in hir armonye, The sharpe thorne towadre the partye Of hir herte, kepeth wakyr hir corage, That nouther cokkowe nor howle by enuye May for no slouth fynde in hir avauntage. 17 Take of this mater an applycacion, To say Parnell of herte glad and light That euer was wakir of hole entencyon To serue Ihesu, nat sluggy day nor night, Callyd the nightyngale with heuenly fethers bright, Gaue thanke to God in langoure and sekenesse, Venquesshid iii enmies thrugh grace of Goddis might, And made hir ende in vrgynall clennesse.

Hir martirdam wrought by grete duresse,— Ay vnmutable in hir stablenesse, Vn-to the dethe ay one in hir suffraunce, So was hir herte roted on constaunce. 4 In Crystes feith she gan hir so delyte, For whom she lyste despyse al worldly glorye, This daysye, with leves rede and white, Purpul hewed, as maked is memorye, Whan that hir blode was shad oute by victorye, The chaste lely of whos maydenhede Thorugh martyrdam was spreynt with roses rede. 5 Margarete, the storye dothe hir calle, After a stone ynamed Margarite, A precyous gemme amonge these stones alle, In there bokes as clerkys liste to write; For of nature perlys echone ben white, Right vertuous of kynde, rounde and small— Whiche propurtees resemblen hir at alle. 6 She was first white by virginyte, In al hir lyvyng preuyde vertuous; And smal she was by humylite; Right strong in God, this maide glorious; And for she was thurgh deth victoryous, Thurgh hir triumphe she gate the palme in heuene, With laurer crowned above the sterres seuene. 7 This stone in vertu is a cordyal, To the spirit a grete confortatyf; Right so hir herte was imperyal I mene, in vertu duryng al hir lyf; For she venquesshed with al hir mortal stryf The deuel, the worlde, her storye dothe devyse, And of hir flesshe she made a sacryfice 8 Vnto the lorde, that starf vpon the rode, Whan he liste deye for oure redempcyoun; So this virgine, taquyte him, shad hir blode Ful benygnely in her passyoun.

Here endeth the prolog of Seynt Margarete, and next folwyng begynneth the storye of hir. 12 In Anthiochye, a famous grete Citee, This blyssed mayde, this martir gloryous Whilom was born, hire legende ye may see,— Hir fader callid Theodosius; And as the storye playnly telleth vs, A patryark he was of Paynym lawes After the ryghtes vsed in tho dawes. 13 To a Noryce this mayde was ytake, Right gracious of shape and of visage: The Paynym lawe of herte she hath forsake And was baptised in hir tendre age, For whiche hir fader gan fallen in a rage And to hir-ward bare ful grete haterede, Whan that he knewe she crystened was in dede. 14 And whan that she by processe dede atteyne Vnto the Age of xv. yere, With othir maydnes of beaute souereyne, This holy virgyne, benygne and glad of chere, Flouryng in vertu, moste goodly and entere, Humble of hir porte, this gracyous creature Kepte of hir Noryce the shepe in theire pasture. 15 Devoyde of pride, of rancour and of Ire, She called was a mirrour of mekenesse, The Holy Gost hir herte so dede enspire That wille and thought were sette on parfitnesse, To thynke on Criste was holy hir gladnesse, And chere benygne to alle she dede shewe, Softe of hir speche, and but of wordys fewe. 16 She gat hir love vpon euery syde, By cause she was so inly vertuous,— For God and grace with hir dide abide— Al thyng eschewyng that was vycious;— Til that the Prefette, called Olibrius, Prefectus no mie Olibrius Of auenture rode on his pleyng, Where he sawe first this mayde, hir shepe kepyng. 17 He was rauesshede anoon with hir beaute, Hir grete fairnesse whan he dide aduerte, Hir fresshe face eke whan he dide see; Hir heuenly Iyen perced thurgh his herte, Brent in his corage with importable smerte: This cruel wolfe, for love inpacyent, Cast him devowre this cely Innocent. 18 Firste to him-self thus he spake and sayde: “What is she this, where dothe this goodely duelle? Who saw ever to-forn so faire a maide, Whiche alle othir in beaute dothe excelle? Of wommanhede she is the verray welle; For me semeth myn herte in euery weyne Is thurgh perced with hir Iyen tweyne.” 19 And with that thought he made for to gone His seruauntes to hir Innocence, Bad thei sholde enquere of hir anoon, What that she was, with al hir diligence, And reporte vnto his presence Of hir lynage playnly how it stode And where she were born of gentil blode; 20 “And of hir birthe if that she be fre, I wille hir haue sothly to my wyfe, Loue and cherysshe for hir grete beaute, As it is skyle, duryng al my lyfe, That atwene vs ther shal be no stryfe; And if she be born of foreyne lyne, I wille hir take to my concubyne.” 21 Whan she was brought vnto his presence, First he enquerede of hir condicyoun, Bad hir declare platly in sentence Of hir lawe and hir religioun, And of hir kyn, by short conclusyoun, Clerly dyscure, and the trouthe attame, Hooly hir purpos, and what was hir name. 22 She, not to Rekel for noon hastynesse, But ful demure and sobre of contenaunce, Gan looke on him, by grete avisenesse, Dressyng to God hir hertes remembraunce, Of chere nor colour ther was no variaunce; Constaunt of herte, this holy blyssed mayde To the Prefecte euene thus she saide: 23 “Touchynge my lynage, by successyoun My bloide conveied is fro grete noblesse, My name Margarete; and of religioun I am cristen, in verray sothfastnesse; And in that lawe, with-oute doublenesse, For lyf or dethe playnly I wille abide, Perseuere stable, and varien on no side.” 24 Wher-of the Iuge in manere gan disdeyne, To hir saide, for short conclusioun,— “Margarete, ther ben thinges tweyne Ful couenable to thi condicyoun: And this the first, to myn oppinioun, Of thi byrthe the grete nobilite, And the seconde is thi grete beaute, 25 “Whiche in thi persone Ioyned ben y-fere, Worthi to be called a Margarite, Of fairenesse of shape and eke of chere, A chose gemme among these perles white; And in this tweyne for I me delite, Sewyng my counsaille thou mustest condiscende Better avysed the thride to amende. 26 “To thi beaute it were a ful grete loos, To thi youthe and to thi maydenhede, To leve on him that deied on a croos, I holde it foly; wherfore take goode hede, For-sake his feithe, and do as I the rede; First lat that God of the be denyed Which on a tre was hange and crucified.” 27 “Certes,” quod she, “what euer that thou seye, He wilfully suffred passioun, And humbely liste for mankynde deye And sched his blode for oure redempcioun To make vs fre, and payen oure raunsoun, Of his Ioye that we ne sholde mysse Where now he regneth eternaly in blysse.” 28 The Iuge, wrothe, sent hir to prisoun, There to abide tille on the next day, Makyng as thoo, no dilacioun, Bad she sholde in al the haste thei may Be brought aforn him, to seyn yee or nay Touchyng hir creaunce, what was hir lawe or feithe; And to hir evenne thus he seithe: 29 “Margarete,” quod he, “haue pite on thyne age, And haue eke mercy on thi grete fairnesse. Spille not thi thought of foly ne of rage, But tourn thyn herte, and thi wittes dresse To our goddes, and do thi besynesse Hem to honour and plese her deyete, As thou desirest to lyue in prosperite.” 30 Quod she ageyn: “with hert, wille and thoughte I worship him verrayly in dede That made man, and after hath him bought, Whom heuene and erthe and the see dothe drede. Alle elementes he dothe conveie and lede, For wynde, nor weder, nor no creature With-oute his mercy may no while endure.” 31 Quod the Iuge: “Anoon but thou consente To my desire as thou hast herde devyse, Truste fully that thou shalt repente. For first I shal in ful cruel wyse Mercyles thy body so chastyse,— Trust me welle, this no feyned tale,— Thi flesshe assonder kerve on peces smale.” 32 Quod Margarete, “while that me lastethe brethe, I shal abide in this oppinioun. Sytthe Criste for me suffred peyne and dethe, Shad al his blode for my redempcyoun, So for his sake, of hole affeccyoun, Be assured that I haue no drede To deye for him, and al my blode to shede.” 33 The Iuge thanne vpon a galowe tre Lete hangen vp this holy pure virgyne, Hir flesshe be rente in his cruelte, Whos blode ran doun right as eny lyne; Lyke a quyke this maiden in her pyne Shad oute hir blode, hir veynes al to-rent, Til of hir body the lycour was al spent. 34 Allas the while! thei that stode beside, Full sore wepten of compassyoun; Allas! for doole! thei myght vnnethe abide To sene hir blode so renne and rayle doun So importable was hir passyoun For Cristes feithe, that the peple abraide And of pite thus to hir thei saide: 35 “O Margareta, allas, whan we take hede Hou thou whilom were faireste vn-to see, But now, allas! thi body is al rede, Steyned with blode, whereof we han pite, Allas! allas! hou myght it euere be To sene a mayde yonge, fresshe, and tendre of age Mighty to endure of tourment suche arage? 36 “Whi hast thou lost thyn excellent fairenesse, Whi hast thou lost this shape and thy beaute? And fynal cause of thi mortal distresse Is thi wilful incredulite. Lete fantasies out of thyn herte fle Now at the last, that thou maist in eese Of thy turment the bitternesse appese.” 37 Quod she: “Goth hens, ye fals counsaylirys, Ye worlde peple, vnsad and euer vntrewe, Flesshely, chaungeable, and in youre desirys Delityng euere in thinges that be newe; Amonge remembreth—and wolde God ye knewe— That of my flesshe the mortal tourmentrie Is to my soule chief salve and remedie.” 38 And to the Iuge thus she saide and spake: “O gredy hounde, lyoun insaciable, On my body thou maiste welle taken wrake, But the soule shal perseuere stable, For Cristes feith abiden immutable. For thilke lorde Crist Ihesu, whom I serve, From al mischief my spirit shal preserve.” 39 The Iuge, confuse sittyng in the place, To beholde myght not sustene The rede blode rayle aboute hir face, Like a ryver rennyng on the grene; Toke his mantel in his mortal tene, Hid his visage, whanne that he toke hede In herte astoned to sene hir sydes blede. 40 Made hir in hast to be taken doun Myd of hir peyne cruel and horrible, And efte ageyne putte hir in prisoun, Where she prayde,—if it were possible, Hir mortal foo, dredful and odible, The lorde besechynge that she myght him see, Whiche cause was of her aduersite, 41 Hir impugnynge thurgh his mortal fight That man first brought to distruccyoun. And sodeynly appered in hir sight, Where as she lay bounden in prisoun, In the lykenesse of a felle dragoun The olde serpent, whiche called is Sathan, And hastyly to assayle her he began; 42 With open mouthe, the virgyne to deuour, First of alle, he swolwed in hir hede, And she deuoutly, hirself to socoure, Gan crosse hirself, in hir mortal drede; And by grace, anoone or she toke hede, The horrible beste, in relees of hir peyne, Brast assondre, and partyd was on tweyne. 43 And efte ageyne to assayl hir he began, The story seith, and after dothe appeere By gret disceit in lykenesse of a man; And she deuoutly, with hir yen clere Lyfte vp to God, gan maken hir prayere. And as she lay in hir orisoun, Vnder hir fete lyggyng the dragoun, 44 The deuel, venquysshed, toke hir by the honde, Spake thes wordes, as I shal devyse: “Thou hast me bounde with invisible bonde, Whiche victorie ought ynogh suffice! Cese of thy power, and lat me now aryse, For I may not abiden thi constreynt, In this batayle thou hast me made so feynt.” 45 And she aroos with-oute fere or drede, This cely ma[i]de, this tendre creature, By grace of God hent him by the hede And cast him doun, for al his felle armure, Vnder hir fete—he myght[e] not recure; And on this serpent for to do more wrake, Hir ryght fote she sette upon his bake. 46 “Oo feende,” quod she, “of malyse serpentyne, Remembre of the how I haue victorye, A clene mayde, by powere femynyne, Whiche shall be rad to myn encrees of glorye, Perpetuelly putte eke in memorie, How a mayde hath put vnder fote Sathan, that is of synne crope and roote.” 47 With that the serpent lowde gan to crie, “Thou hast me brought shortly to vttraunce, I am ve[n]quysshed, I may it not denye, Ageyns the ful feble is my puyssaunce, Thyn Innocence hath brought me to myschaunce, And a mayde, but of yeeres tendre, Hath me outrayed with hir lymmes sklendre. 48 “Yif that a man, whiche had force and myght, Had me venquysshed, I myght it welle sustene; But now, allas, ageyn al skele and ryght, A cely virgyne, a mayde pure and clene, Hath me bore down in al my felle tene; And this, allas, bothe at eve and morowe Is grettest cause of my dedly sorowe. 49 “This encreseth grete party of my peyne, Whan I consydre with-ynne my-self and see How thi fader and moder bothe tweyne Were in their tyme friendly vnto me; But thou allone, thurgh thy virginite, Thi chast[e] lyf, thy parfyt holynesse Han me venquysshed and outrayed in distress.” 50 Whan she bigan the serpent to constreyne To discure, and no thinge to hyde By what mene and what manere treyne, Outher by malys, outher by envye and pryde That he assailed man on any syde. “The kynde of man, telle on anoon,” quod she, “And be welle ware thou lye nat to me.” 51 “Sothely,” quod he, “I may it not denye,— To seyn the trouthe playnly, and not spare, My nature is of custume for to lye, As I that am of trouthe and vertue bare, Lyggynge awayte ayenste the welfare Of folkes goode, and alway envyous To alle that ben parfite and vertuous, 52 “Naturelly to hem I haue envye, Though thei thurgh vertu me ofte put abak, And whan it falleth thei haue of me mastrie, Ageyn to me resorteth al the wrak; Of charite I haue so grete a lak, So grete sorowe only for lak of grace That man in heuene sholde occupye my place. 53 “Yet, wote I welle, I may it not recure, Nor in that place shal I neuer abide, But in helle sorowe and peyne endure, From heuene caste for my grete pryde— This foule vice fro thennes was my guyde, Yet of malys, thye trouthe for to telle, Envye I haue that man ther sholde duelle. 54 “This eke trouthe that whilom Salamon, As bookes olde recorden and conclude, Closed in a vesselle fendes many on And of spiritus a grete multitude, Whiche Innocentes ful often can delude; But after dethe of that prudent kynge Fro that vessel thei caste out fire sparklynge. 55 “Men supposyng in theire oppinioun There was closed grete tresour and rychesse, Brak the vessel of entencyoun, And sodeynly the fendes gan hem dresse Oute of that holde fer fro that distresse, At her oute-goyng enfectyng al thayre, Where thei abiden and haue theire repaire; 56 “Which to mankynde do ful grete damage By their malys and ther temptacions, To olde and yonge and euery manere age, By ther conspired fals illusyouns; But fynally all ther collusyons Goth vnto nought, and al ther violence, Whan ther is made myghty resistence.” 57 Whan the serpent malicyous and olde To the mayde, whos fote dede him oppresse, Had his processe and his tale tolde, She with-drowe to done him more duresse; And the dragoun upwarde gan him dresse, Disapered, and forth his wey is goo; And she, assured of hir gostly foo, 58 Wenquysshed hath the prynce of al derkenesse, And sitthe she hathe ouercome the hede, It faylethe nat she nedes moste oppresse His cruel mynystre, and haue of him no drede. And sewyng on, this floure of goodelyhede The next[e] day, voyde of all refuge Save of the lorde, was brought afore the Iuge, 59 Ful moche peple beyng in presence. And for she wolde do no sacryfice The fals goddes, by mortal violence She was dispoiled in ful cruel wyse And naked stode, that folke myght hir despise; And after that this gemme of maydenhede Was brent with brondus bright as eny glede, 60 Hir sydes skorched, whilom white as melke, The cruel mynystres liste hir nat to spare, For Crystes sake, hir body, softe as selke, Mercyles, naked stode and bare; And to avment and encrese hir care, In boylyng water she was caste and bounde, The [wawys burblyng] [with bolles grete &amp; round]. 61 The folkes alle, that stonden enviroune Of doo[l]ful pite, that sawe this auenture, Gan wepe and pleyne, and of compassyoun Merueyled sore a tendre creature Sustene myght suche tourment and endure; For the tyraunt, to make hir peynes straunge, In fire and water gan hir tourment change. 62 And sodeynly there fille an erthe-quave. The people, in drede, dempte it was vengeaunce; And fyve thousand, for God wolde hem save, Conuerted weren from there myscreaunce, For Cristes sake heveded by vengeaunce,— Se how a mayde in al hir tourmentrie The feith of Crist coude magnifie. 63 The blynde Iuge, all voyde of happe and grace, Last that othre conuerted wolde be To Cristes feith, withoute lenger space Commaunded hath that this mayde fre, In youth flourynge and virginite, To ben heueded, withoute more tarying, In hir praier as she lay knelynge. 64 But first she praied of humble affeccyoun To the Iuge, to graunten hir leysere That she myght make hir orisoun, And haue a space to lyue in hir praiere. And ful deuoutly with hert hole and entere Vpon the poynte when she sholde deye, The blessed virgyne thus bygan to preye. 65 First she praide of parfite charite primo orauit pro suis persecutoribus. For hir enemys and hir tourmentours, For hem that caused hir aduersite And had hir pursued with mony sharpe shours, Of parfit loue she gadrid oute the flours, Praying also for thoo folkes alle That after helpe vnto hir grace calle. 66 And for alle thoo that haue hir in memorie, Peticio &amp; per eius memoriam agentibus &amp; se inuocantibus. And swiche as truste in hir helpe at nede; That God hem graunte, sittinge in his glorie, Of his grace that thei may welle spede, And ageyn right that no man hem myslede, “And, lorde,” quod she, “to alle be socoure That for thi sake done to me honoure. 67 “And specyally to the I beseche Etiam denote orauit ad deum ut quecunque in partu parielitans se inuocauit ille sa prolem emittet.

And than this maide, moste of excellence, Roos vp deuoutly, and no thynge afferde Seide vnto him whiche that helde the swerde: 70 “Come nere,” quod she, “myn oune brother dere, Smyte with the swerde, and loke thou spare nought. My body shal behynde abiden here, But my soule to heuene shall be brought.” Her hede enclynynge with an humble thought; The mynystre with al his myght and peyne Lefte vp his swerde and smote hir necke on tweyne. 71 The peple of pite gan to crie and soun That stode and sawe hir bitter passioun; Of martirdam thus she toke the croun[e] For Cristes feithe, with hole affeccyoun. Threttene kalendes, the boke maketh mencyoun, Of Iul this maide, a merour of constaunce, Was laureat thurgh hir parfit suffraunce. 72 An holy seynt writeth of this maide, and seithe: “This Margareta, parfyt of hir creaunce, With drede of God moste stable in hir feythe, Vn-to the deth hauyng perseueraunce Sette hoole to God with thought and remembraunce, In herte ay compunt, she was so vertuous, Euery-thing eschewyng that was vicious. 73 “Hir blyssed lyf, hir conuersacioun Were example of parfite pacience, Of grounded clennesse and of religioun, Of chastite founded on prudence; God gaf to hir souerayn excellence In hir tyme that she shulde be To all a maisterasse of virginite. 74 “Hir fadir, modir, hir kynred she forsoke, Hir holy lyuynge was to hem odious, To Cristes lawe al holy she hir toke, This blissed mayde, this virgin glorious, Of alle hir enemyes she was victorious, Til at the laste, in vertu complet goode, For Cristes sake she shad hir chaste bloode.” Explicit vita sancte Margarete.

Explicit. 38. THE LEGEND OF ST. AUSTIN AT COMPTON. [From MS. Harl. 2255, leaves 24–32.] Offre vp yowre Dymes. 1 Lyk as the Bible makith mencioun, The original ground of devout offryng, Callyd of clerkys iust decimacioun, In pleyn Ynglissh trewe and iust tithyng; Abel began Innocent of lyving, Oonly to God for to do plesaunce, Of frut, of beestys, reknyd euery-thyng, Gaff God his part, tenthe of his substaunce. 2 Melchisedech, bisshop, preest, and kyng, To Abraham, a prynce of gret puissaunce, For his victorye at his hoom-Comyng, Whan Amelech was brouht unto uttraunce, Offryd bred and wyn with devout obeisaunce, Of alle Oblaciouns figurys out to serche; On bred and wyn, by roial suffisaunce, The feith is groundid of al hooly cherche. 3 Of good greyn sowe growith up good wheete, With gret labour plantyd is the vyne, The tenthe part is to our lord moost meete, To whose preceptis, heuenly and divyne, We muste our heedys meekly doun enclyne, Paye our dymes by his Comaundementis, Moyses lawe and Eek bi the doctryne, Foure Ewangelistis and too Testamentis. 4 Fro Melchisedech doun to Abraham, To sette of tithes a fundacioun, Th'encrees of frute and al that therof cam They trewly made ther oblacioun; Whan Iacob sauh in his avisioun, Tyme that he slepte upon the cold[e] stoon, Sauh on a laddere goon angelis up and doun, To God above made his avowh anoon. 5 This was his vowh, with gret humylite, Lik his entent in ful pleyn language; “Lord, yif thou list to conduite me, Of thy grace, Fortune my passage, To retourne hoom to myn herytage, My fadris hous come therto by-tymes, Of good and tresour, with al the surplusage, I shal to the offren vp the dymes.” 6 Among al frutys in especial, By a prerogatif excellent and notable, In worthynesse verray imperial, Of reverence condigne and honourable, By antiquite in templys custumable, In hooly writ remembryd ofte sithes, Wyn, Oyle, and wheete, frutis moost acceptable, To God above were offryd vp for tythes. 7 The Patriark of antiquyte, Callyd Isaak next by Successioun, To Abraham which with thes frutys thre Gaff to Iacob his benediccioun: The which thre in comparisoun, Of the moralité who-so takith heed, To preesthood first and kynges of renoun, Gret mysteries in Oyle wyn and breed. 8 Breed and wyn to bisshopis apparteene, Oyle longith for to anoynte kynges, Offryng is maad of frutys ripe and greene, Of Foul and beeste and of al othir thynges; Breefly conclude alle folk in there livynges, That trewly tithe with glad herte and face, Patriarkis, prophetis in ther writynges, Shal evere encreese with fortune, hap, and grace. 9 And who fro God with-halte his dew[e]te, Lat hym knowe for pleyn conclusyoun, Of warantise he shal nevir the, Lakke grace and vertuous foysoun; Of ther tresour discrece in ech sesoun, To hoolychirche that wil nat pay hys dyme, Lat hym adverte and haue inspeccioun, What ther befyl in Awstynes tyme. 10 I meene Austyn that was fro Rome sent, By Seyn Gregory in to this regioun, Graciously arryued up in Kent, Famous in vertu, of gret perfeccioun; His liff was lyk his predicacioun, As he tauht, sothely so he wrouhte: By his moost hooly conversacioun, Into this lond the feith of Crist he brouhte. 11 Thoruh al the parties and provynces of the lond, Of Cristis gospel he gan the seed to sowe, Unkouth myracles wrouhte with hys hand, Worshipped he was bothe of hih and lowe; With-outen pompe grace hath his horn so blowe, Thoruh his merites that the hevenly soun, He callid was as it is wel knowe, Cristes Apostil in Brutis Albioun. 12 He was Aurora whan Phebus sholde arise, With his briht beemys on that lond to shyne, Callyd day-sterre moost glorious to devise; Our feith was dirkid undir the Ecliptic lyne; Our mysbeleeve he did first Enlumyne, Whan he out-sprad the briht[e] beemys cleere, Of Cristes lawe by his parfit doctryne, Thoruh al this land to make his liht appeere. 13 This was doon by grace or we wer war, Of tholygoost by the influence, Whan foure steedys of Phebus goldene char, List in this regioun holde residence; Who droff the char to Conclude in sentence, By goostly favour of the nyne speerys, Til blissed Austyn, by goostly elloquence, Was trewe Auriga of foure gospelleeris. 14 Or Austyn cam, we slombryd in dirknesse, Lyk ydolastres blyndid in our siht, Of Cristes feith was curteyned the cleernesse, Tyl Sol justicie list shewe his beemys briht; Of his mercy to clarefye the liht, Chace away our cloudy ignoraunce, The lord of lordys of moost imperial myht, Tavoyde away our froward mescreaunce. 15 First fro the Pope that callid was Gregory, Awstyn was sent, who that list adverte, Tyme and date be put in memory, To Cristes feith whan he did vs converte, Our goostly woundys felte as tho gret smerte; Deed was our soule, our boody Eek despised, Tyl Awstyn made vs cast of cloth and sherte, In coold watir by hym we wer baptised. 16 Kyng Ethelbert regnyng that tyme in Kent, Touchyng the date whan Awstyn cam first doun, Noumbryd the tyme whan that he was sent, By Pope Gregory into this regioun, Yeer of our Lord by computacioun, Compleet five hundryd fourty and Eek nyne, As cronyclers make mencioun, In ther bookys fully determyne. 17 Thus he began by grace of Goddis hond, Wher God list werche may be noon obstacle, By his labour was cristened al this lond, Feith of our lord wex moor cleer than spectacle; Whan tholygoost made his habitacle In tho personys that wern in woord and deede, By Awstyn tournyd, God wrouhte a gret myracle, To make hem stable in Articles of the Creede. 18 But to resorte ageyn to my mateere, With thOlygoost Austyn sett a-fire, Gan preche and teche devoutly the maneere Of Cristes lawe abrood in every shire: Grace of our Lord did hym so inspire, To Enlwmyne al this regioun, Of aventure his herte gan desire To Entre a village that callid was Comptoun. 19 The parissh preest of the same place, Aforn provided in ful humble wyse, Bosouhte hym meekly that he wolde of grace Here his compleynt as he shal devise: In pleyn language told hym al the guyse, Lord of that thorpe requeryd ofte sithes, He ay contrayre tobeye to themprise, Of hooly chirche list nat paye his tithes. 20 “Entretid hym lik to his estat, First secrely, next afforn the toun, But al for nouht I fond hym obstynat, Moost indurat in his oppynyoun; Toold hym the Custom groundid on resoun, He was bounde by lawe of oold writyng, To pay his dymes, and for rebellioun I cursyd hym, cause of fals tithyng. 21 “This mateer hool ye must of riht redresse; Requeryng you of your goodly heede, By your discrecioun to do rihtwisnesse, Peysen al the cas and prudently take heede That hooly chirche haue no wrong in deede; Al thyng commytted and weyed in ballaunce, Ye to be Iuge, and lyk as ye proceede We shall obeye to youre ordynaunce.” 22 Hooly Awstyn, sad and wel avised, Kneuh by signes this compleynt was no fable, And in maneer was of the caas agrised, Fond that the lord was in that poynt coupable; To reduce hym and mak hym moor tretable, As the lawe ordeyned hath or riht, Blissid Awstyn, in Cristes feith moost stable, Took hym apart seyde unto this knyght, 23 “How may this be that thou art [so] froward To hooly chirche to pay thy dewtee, Lyk thy desert thou shalt haue thy reward; Thynk that thou art bounde of trouthe &amp; equitee, To paye thy tithes; and lerne this of mee, The tenthe part fro God yif thou withdrawe, Thou myste incurre, of necessite, To been accursyd by rigour of the lawe.” 24 The knyht, astonyd somwhat of his cheer, “Sire,” quod he, “I wol wel that ye knowe, My labour is ay from yeer to yeer By revolucioun that the lond be sowe, Afore this peple stondyng here arowe, By evidence to maken an open preef, What maner boost that ony man list blowe, I with the nynthe wil have the tenthe cheef. 25 “Sey what ye list, I wyl have no lasse.” This was the answere pleynly of the knyht; Hooly Austyn dispoosid hym to masse, Ful devoutly and in the peeplys siht, Tornyd his face, comaundith anoon riht, Ech cursyd man that wer out of grace Tyme of his masse that euery maneer wiht That stood accursyd, voyde shulde his place. 26 Present that tyme many creature, Withoute abood or any long taryeng, Ther roos up oon out of his sepulture, Terrible of face, the peeple beholdyng, A great paas the chircheyeerd passyng, The Seyntuarye bood ther a greet whyle, Al the space the masse was seyeng, Feerfully afore the chirche style. 27 With-oute meevyng, alway stille he stood, The peeple feerful in ther oppynyoun, Almoost for dreed they gan to wexen wood, Afftir masse alle of assent cam doun, To hooly Austyn made relacioun, Of al this caas riht as it was falle, Gaff hem a spirit of consolatioun, Ful sobirly spak unto them alle. 28 Sad and discreet in his aduertence, Sauh by ther poort that they stood in dreede, First of alle with ful devout reverence, Cros and hooly watir he made aforn proceede; The Crucifix their baner was in deede, Blissid Austyn the careyn gan compelle:— “In Iesu name, that lyst for man to bleede, What that thu art trewly for to telle.” 29 “Disobeisaunt my tithes for to paye, Of yoore agoon I was lord of this toun, My dew[e]tees I did alwey delaye, Stood accursyd for my rebellioun, Made in my liff no restitucioun, Geyn thy biddyng I myht no socour haue; My cursed Careyn, ful of corrupcioun, By Goddis angel was cast out of my graue. 30 “Thy precept was upon ech a side, Beyng at masse whil thou were in presence, No stynkyng flessh myht in the poorche abyde, I was take up, lad forth by violence; On me was yove so dreedful a sentence Of Curs, allas! which to my diffame, Now as ye seen, for disobedience Disclaundrid is perpetuelly my name. 31 “Tyme whan Britouns wer lordis of this lond, Hadde the lordship and domynacioun, The same tyme as ye shal undirstond, Of this village in soth I was patroun; To hooly chirche hadde no devocioun, Offte sith steryd of my Curat To paye my dymes, hadde indignacioun, Was ay contrayre, froward, and obstinat. 32 “This hundryd yeer I have enduryd peyne, And fifty ovir by Computacioun, Greet cause have I to moorne and to compleyne, In a dirk prisoun of desolacioun, Mong firy flawmys, voyd of remissioun.” And whil that he this wooful tale toold, Hooly Austyn with the peeple enviroun, Wepte of compassioun, as they to watir woold. 33 Austyn gan muse in his oppynyoun, To fynde a mene the sowle for to save, Of this terrible doolful inspeccioun The peeplis hertys gretly gan abave, Whom to behoolde they cowde no coumfort have Al the while the careyn was in ther presence, Austin axith yif he knew the grave, Of thilke preest that gaf vn hym sentence, 34 “So longe aforn for thy fals tythyng, As we have herd the mateere in substaunce.” “Sothly,” quod he, “ther shal be no taryeng, But ye shal have a reconysaunce, So ye wil digge and doon youre observaunce, To delvyn up his boonys dul and rude, Loo! heer he lith, cheef cause of my grevaunce, So fel a curs he did on me conclude.” 35 Austyn fulfilled of grace and all vertu, As ony pileer in our feith moost stable, The deed preest, in name of Crist Iesu, He bad arise with woordys ful tretable; Requeryd hym, by tokenys ful notable, Yif he hadde sith tyme that he was born Seyn that Owgly careyn lamentable, The deed body that stood hem beforn. 36 “Sothly,” quod he, “and that me rewithe soore, That evir I knewh hym for his frowardnesse, I gaf hym counseil, daily moore and moore, To paye his tithes, the pereil did expresse; He took noon heed his surfetys to redresse; I warnyd him many divers tymes, But al for nouht, I can weel bere witnesse, Deyed accursyd, rebel to paye his dymes.” 37 Whan the preest hath toold euery deel, With evy cheer and voys most lamentable, Quod Seyn Austyn, “Brothir, thou knowest weel, Thynk he that bouht us is evir merciable, By whose exaumple we must be tretable, As the Gospel pleynly doth recoorde, And for thy part be nat thu vengable, So that with rigour mercy may accorde. 38 “Thynk how Iesus bouht us with his blood, Oonly of mercy suffryd passioun, For mannys sake was nayled on the rood, Rive to the herte for our redempcioun; Remembre how thu dist execucioun Upon this penaunt ploungid in greet peyne, Withdrawe thy sentence and do remissioun, Fro purgatorye his trowblys to restreyne. 39 “On hym thu leydist a ful dreedful bond, To the it longith the same bond to unbynde;

Periit fuga a me et non est qui requirat animam meam. O Christe.

Fac mecum signum in bono ut uideant qui oderunt me et confundantur quoniam tu domine adimuisti me &amp; consolatus es me. O robam. Make me a sygne in my fforhed, Of that hooly vyctoryous tre, On wich thow were maad blood red, That alle my ffoon wich looke on me, My goostly enmyes whan they me se May dreede to ther confusioun, Be-cause my trust ys hooll in the Comfort and Consolacyoun. Amen. This is an holy verse also ageyn goostly enmyes. Delicta iuuentutis mee et ignorancias meas me memineris domine.

And yit, allas, noon heed þer-of þey taake! 15 To paye þe raunsoun of our gret losse He was in loue so gentyle and so free Þat hym deyned be nayled on þe crosse, And lyche a theof hong vpon a tree; Lifft vp þyne hert, vnkynde man, and see Þe nightingale in hir armonye, Þus day and night dooþe vpon þe crye. 16 Sheo cryed “Slee al þoo þat beon vnkynde, And cane of loue þe custume not obserue, Nor in þeyre eyghen no drope of pyte fynde, Nor in þeyre brest for loue no sighe conserue; Why list þee lord, for mannes saake sterve But for to paye of fredam þe raunsoun, His hert[e] blood for þeyre redempcioun?” 17 Hees wowndes fyve for man he did vncloose Of hondes, of feet, and of his fayre syde; Make of þees fyve, in þyn hert a roose And let it þeer contynuelly abyde, Forget hem not wher þou goo or ryde Gadre on heepe þees rosen floures fyve, In þy memorye enprynt hem al þy lyve. 18 Þis is þe Roos which first gan wexen reed, Spreynt ouer al with dropes of paurpur huwe, Whan Cryst Iesu was for mankynde ded And hade vpon a garnement ful nuwe, His holy moder, his Cousin eek Saint Johan, Suche array to-fore saughe þey neer noon. 19 Which to beholde God wot þey wer not feyne His blessed body to seen so al to-rent, A crowne of thorne þat throbbed thorugh his breyne, And al þe blood of his body spent; His hevenly eyeghen, allas, deeþe haþe eblent, Who might for routhe susteyne and to beholde But þat his hert of pytee shoulde colde? 20 Þis war þe saame which þat Isaye. Saugh frome Edome came, with his clooþe depeynt Steyned in Bosra, eeke did him aspye Baaþed in blood, til he gan wexen feynt. Þis is he þat drank eysell and galle emeynt, Þis is he þat was to-fore Pylate atteynt, With false accusours in the Consistorye, Oonly to bring mankynde to his glorye. 21 He was moost feyre founden, in his stoole Walkyng of vertues with mooste multytude, Blessed, beningne and hevenly of his scoole, Which with his souffrance Sathan can conclude, His humble dethe did þe deuel delude, Whane he mankynd brought out of prysoun, Making his fynaunce with his passyoun. 22 Ysaye þe moost renommed prophete, Axed of him, why his garnement, Was red and blody, ful of dropes wete, So disguysed was his vestyment; Lyke hem þat pressin quayers of entent In þe pressour, boþe þe rede and whyte, So was he pressyd þy Raunsoun for to quyte. 23 “Hit is I,” quod he, “þat trade it al allone. With-outen felawe I gane þe wyn outpresse, Whane on þe crosse I made a deolful moone And thorough myn hert þe sperehed gan hit dresse, Who felt euer so passyng gret duresse?— Whane alle my freondes alloone me forsooke And I my self þis iourne on me tooke. 24 “Excepte my moder þer durst noon abyd Of my discyples þat weren me suwende: Saynt Iohan for loue stoode by myn oþer syde, Alle þe remenaunt fro me dyden weende. Þe Iewes my flesshe a-sondre dyden reende Who was it but I þat aboode in þe vyne To presse out wyne, þy raunsoun for to fyne? 25 “For mannes saake with me ful harde it stoode, For-saken of alle and eeke desconsolate; Þey lefft no drope, but druwe out al my blood; Was neuer noon so pore in noon estate, Alle my descyples lefft me desolate Vpon þe crosse, bytwene theoves tweyne, And noon aboode to rewe vpon my peyne. 26 “Oo yee alle þat passen by þe wey, Lifft vp þe eghe of youre aduertence! Sawe yee euer any man so dye With-outen gilt, þat neuer did offence? Or is þer ony sorowe in existence Lyche þe sorowe þat I did endure To bye mankynde, vnkynde creature? 27 “For þe surfeyte of þy synnes alle, And for þoffence of þy wittes fyve, My touche, my taast, myn hering did appalle, Smellyng and sight ful feoble were als blyue, Þus in yche party þat man may contryve I suffred peyne, and in euery membre Þat any man can reken or remembre. 28 “Ageyne þe synnes pleynly of þyn hede I hade vpon a crowne of thornes keene; Bitter teres were medled with my bred, For mannes trespas I felt all þe teene, Myne eyen blynde þat whylome shoone so sheene, And for man in my thrust most feel, I drank galle tempred with eyseel. 29 “For mannys looking fulfilled with outrage, And for his tonge ful of detraccyoun, I alloone souffred þe damage, And ageyne falshede of adulacion I drank galle poynaunt as poysoun; Ageyns hering of tales speken in veyne I hade rebuyk and sayde no worde ageyne. 30 “Geyne pryde of beaute, where as folkes trespas, I suffred my-self gret aduersytee, Beten and benchyd in myn owen face, Ageyns touching, if men list to see, Myne handes were nayled fast vn-to þe tree; And for misfootyng, where men went wrong, My feet thorugh percyd, were not my peynes strong? 31 “Was it not I þat trespassed nought, Þat had myne hert perced even atweyne, And neuer ofended oonys in a thought, Yit was it kerve thorugh in euery veyne? Who felt euer in eorþe so gret peyne To reken al giltles as did I? Wher-for þis bridde sang ay, ‘occy, occy’ 32 “Suche as beon to me founde vnkynde And haue no mynde kyndely of resoun, But of slouthe haue elefft byhynde Þe hole remembraunce of my passyoun, By meene of which and mediacyoun Ageyne al poysoun of þe synnes seven Tryacle I brought, sent hem doun frome heven. 33 “Ageyns pryde, Remembre my meeknesse, Geyne coveytyse thenk on my pouerte, Ageyne lechcherye thenk on my clennesse, Ageyns envye thenk on my charytee, Ageyns gloutonye aduerte in hert and se How þat I for mannes gret offence Fourty dayes lyved in abstynence.” 34 Of meeknesse he did his heued enclyne Ageyns þe synne and þe vyce of pryde, Ageyns envye streght out as a lyne, Spradde his armes out on euery syde Tenbrace his freondes and with hem abyde, Shewing hem signes, who so list to see, Grounde of his peynes was parfyt charyte. 35 Ageyns coueytyse, mankynde to redresse Thorugh-nayled weren his hooly handis tweyne, Shewing of fredam a bounteuouse almesse Whane he for loue suffred so gret peyne, To make mankynde his blisse to atteyne. And his largesse to rekken by and by I shal rehers his gifftes ceryously. 36 He gaf his body to man for chief repaast, Restoratyff best in þe fourme of bred, At his maundee or he hennes past His blessed blood in fourme of wyn ful red, His soule in prys whanne þat he was ded, And of oure synnes as cheef lauender Out of his syde he gaf vs water cleere. 37 He gaf also his pourpur vestement To þe Iewys þat did him crucefye. To his apostilles he gaf eeke of entent His blessed bodye, ded whane he did lye. And his moder þat cleped was Marye, Þe keping of hir he gaf to Saynt John And to his fader his goost whane hit was goon. 38 Ageyns slouthe he shewed gret doctryne Whane he him hasted towardes his passyoun, Agenyst wrathe þis was his dicyplyne Whane he was brought texamynacyoun, A sofft aunswere with-oute rebellyoun, Ageynst gloutounye he drank eysell and galle Toppresse sourfaytes of vycyous folkes alle. 39 He gaf also a ful gret remedye To mankynd hir sores for to sounde; For ageyne þe heete of lechcherye Meekly he souffred many a greuous wownde, For noon hoole skyn was on his body founde, Nor þer was seyne oþer apparayle But blood, allas, aboute his sydes raylle! 40 Þer he was sone and his fadres heyre With him alloone by peternytee, Hit was a thing incomparable feyre Þe sone to dye to make his seruaunt free, Him fraunchysing with suche libertee; To make man þat was thorugh synne thralle Þe court tenheryte above celestyal. 41 Þeos kyndnesses wheeche I to þee reherce, Let hem devoyde frome þoblyuyoun, And let þe nayles wheche thoroughe is feet did perce Ben cleere myrour of þy redempcyoun.

Receyued helthe, salue and medecyne Of all þeyre hurtes þat were serpentyne. 46 Þis banier is moste mighty of vertu Geyns feondes defence mighty and cheef obstacle Mooste noble staue and token of Tayu To Esechyel shewed by myracle, Chief chaundellabre of þe tabernacle, Wher through was caused al his cleere light Voyding al derknesse of þe cloudy night. 47 Þis was þe tree of mankyndes boote, Þat stynt hir wrathe and brought in al þe pees, Which made þe water of maraþe fresh and swoote, Þat was to-forne moost bitter, doutelesse, Þis was þe yerde of werþy Moyses, Which made þe children of Israell go free And drye fotyd thorough þe Red See. 48 This was þe slyng which with stoones fyve Worthy David, as bookes specefye, Gan þe hede and þe helme to ryve Of þe Geant þat called was Golye, Wheeche fyve stoones taking þalegorye Ar þe fyve woundes, as I rehers can, With wheeche þat Cryst venqwyssht haþ Sathan. 49 O synful soule! why nyltowe taken keepe Of his peynes remembring on þe shoures? Forsaake þe worlde, and waake oute of þy sleep And to þe gardeyn of parfyt paramours Maake þy passage, and gader þer þy floures Of verray vertu, and chaunge al þyne olde lyff; And in þat gardyn beo contemplatyff. 50 For þis worlde here booþe at even and morowe, Who list consider aright in his resoun, Is but an exyle and a desert of sorowe, Meynt ay with trouble and tribulacyoun; But who list fynde consolacyoun Of goostely Ioye, let him þe worlde forsake And to þat gardin þe right wey[e] take, 51 Wher as þat god of loue him-self doþe dwelle Vpon an hille, fer frome þe mortal vale, Canticorum þe book ful weel can telle, Calling his spouse with sugred notes smale Where þat ful lowd þamerous nightingale Vpon a thorne is wont to calle and crye To mannys soule with hevenly ermonye, Veni in ortum meum, soror mea. “Come to my gardyn and to myn herber grene My fayre suster and my spouse deere, Frome filthe of synne by vertu made al clene With Cristal paved þaleys beon so clere. Come, for I calle.” Anoon, and þou shalt here, Howe Cryst Ihesu, so blessed mot he be! Calleþe mannys soule of parfyte charyte. 53 He calleþe hir suster and his spouse also, First his suster, who-so list to see, As by his nature, take goode heede here-to, Full nyghe of kyn by consanguynyte, And eeke his spouse by affynytee, I mene as þus baffynyte of grace With goostely loue, whane he hit dooþe enbrace. 54 And eeke his suster by semblance of nature Whane þat he tooke oure humanyte Of a mayde moost clennest and pure, Fresshest of floures þat sprang oute of Iesse As flour eordeyned for to releeve man, Which bare þe frut þat sloughe our foo Sathan. of þis balade daune Iohn made no more. 44. THE CHILD JESUS TO MARY, THE ROSE. [MS. B. M.

Whan I for man was borne in my manhede; For whiche with Rosis of heuenly Influence I me reioyse to pley in thy presence. 2 Benyng moder! who first dide inclose The blessed budde that sprang out of Iesse, Thow of Iuda the verray perfite Rose, Chose of my fader for thyn humylite Without fadyng most clennest to bere me; For whiche with Roses of chast Innocence, I me Reioyse to pley in thi presence. 3 O moder! moder! of mercy most habounde, Fayrest moder that euer was alyve! Though I for man have many a bloody wounde, Among theym alle there be Rosis fyve, Agayne whos mercy fiendis may nat stryve; Mankynde to save, best Rosis of defence, Whan they me pray for helpe in thy presence. 45.

Assit principio sancta maria meo. 1 O blyssed lord my lord, O Cryst Iesu, Welle and hedspryng of eternal swetnesse! Of them that loue the, guerdoun of most vertu, Alle other joyes surmountyng in sothnesse, By prerogatyves, in whom ys all gladnesse, Them to comforte that be Contemplatyf; In ther desyres thow art her cheef rychesse And hooll ther tresour, here in this present lyf. 2 Thow art her helthe and comfort in syknesse, Of synfull sowlys reffute and medycyne, And as thy-sylf, O lord, beryst wytnesse To synfull peple thy presence lyst Enclyne, Took our humanyte of a pure vyrgyne, For our sauacyoun, of mercyfull plesaunce; O Iesu!

Oracio. O lord Iesu! enprente in my memorye Alle these tokenys of thy peynfull passioun; Thy cros, thy deth, on Caluary thy vyctorye, Gravyn in myn herte with hooll affeccyoun, Full repentaunce with pleyn confessioun, And as thow bouhtist me, O Ihesu! with thy blood, Graunt of my synnys full remyssioun, Wich for our sake starff vp-on the Rood. 10 O gracyous Iesu, forgere of the hevene, Lord and cryator of euery cryature, Madyst al thys world and þe planetis vij, Vnmesured, and al thyng mayst mesure; Erthe and mounteins round of ther fygure Closyst in thyn hand as a lytell ball, Remembre, O lord! what wo thow dist endure Naylled on the cros, and lyst to be mortall. 11 For love of man in thyn humanyte Feet &amp; handis thorough percid, &amp; maad reed, Between two thevys vpon the Roode tre, And for our sake, O Iesu! thow were ded, Thy body streyned bothe in lengthe &amp; bred On Good Fryday, with many a mortall wounde; Benyngne Iesu, of pyte tak now heed, O welle of grace, of mercy most habounde! 12 Louly besechyng, Iesu, of thy goodnesse That I may haue thy peynes in memorye, And to remembre the wofull bytternesse Wich thow lyst suffre, to brynge us to þi glorye; And in our hertys pryue consystorye Graunt us, O Iesu, with parfight love &amp; dreed, Of our thre enymyes þat we may haue victorye, By thy meek passioun, þat lyst for man, to bleede. 13 O Iesu!

Oracio. Lowly requyring of mercyfull pyte From alle our enymyes, visible and invisible, Dyffende us, Iesu, that we may go ffre, —Sith to thy power nothyng ys inpossyble— From Sathanys myght, hydous and odyble, Vnder the wyngys of thy proteccyoun, That sufferedyst deth vp-on an hih patyble, Shadewe all þi servauntis with þi meek passioun. Oracio. O Iesu, merour of spirituall cleernesse, Hang on the cros ffor our Redempcyoun, Remembre of all the trouble &amp; hevynesse, Nakyd on the Roode taquyten our raunsoun, Voyd of all comfort and consolacyoun Sauff of thy moder, &amp; thy cosyn Seynt Iohn, To hym assyngnyng the commendacyoun To wayte on hyr, Iesu, whan thow were goon. 20 Vndyr thy cros wepyng whan she stood, Seydyst to hir with a ful dedly cheere, “Behold, O woman most benyngne &amp; good, Behold þi sone, wich that stondeth here,” And to Seynt Iohn seidest in this manere, “Behold þi moder &amp; haue hir in kepyng.” Who myhte his eyen from salte teris stere To seen or heryn this dolerous partyng? 21 The prophesye of Olde Symeoon That same hour kam to remembraunce, A swerd of sorwe shold thorgh hir soule goon. Felt euer modyr so grevous a penaunce? Iesu, whos herte was woundid with a launce, Graunt in al myschef and trybulacyoun We may resorte to ffynde in al greuaunce Mercyful support, lord, in thy passyoun. Oracio. O gracyous Iesu, kyng moost amyable, Aboue all kynges kyng of most puyssaunce, Moost desyrous, our comfort most notable, Our suppowaylle, our post geyn al grevaunce, Thy grete sorwys calle him to remembraunce, Wich thow suffredyst for our aldyr goode, Nakyd allas, perced with a launce, On Good Fryday hangyng on the Roode. 23 Thy frendys fledde, almoost euerychoon, The bront abydyng alone al dosolaat, Except thy moder, thevangelist Seynt Iohn, With weping terys tryst &amp; disconsolat, Swownyng full offte, fil to þe ground prostrat Spak to thy moder that alle myghtyn here, “Woman beholde þi sone in pore estaat,” And to Seynt Iohn, “behold þi moder dere.” Oracio.

For to my purpose I wyll anone procede, The trowthe to recorde, I wyll no lengor tary, Ryght as hit was, a poynt I wyll nat vary. 5 Vincencius in hys speculatyf historiall Of thys sayde monke maketh full mensioun, Vnder the fourme to yow, as I reherse shall, That by a gardeyne as he romyd vp and doune He heerd a bysshop of fame &amp; gret renoune Seying v. psalmes in honour of that flowre, That bare Iesu Cryst oure alther redemptoure. 6 In whiche Psalmes, standyng eche in here degre, Whoso lyst take hede in syngler lettres fyue, This blessyd name Maria there may he se That furst of all oure thraldam can depryue, To the hauen of dethe when we gan arryue, And fro the wawes of this mortall see, Made vs to escape from all aduersite. 7 Dystynctly in Latyn here may ye rede echone, Folowyng these baladys as for youre plesaunce, To whom the bysshop hade sayde hys meditacione, The monke anone delytyd in his remembraunce, And thought he wold as for his most affiaunce Cotydyally with hem oonly oure lady plese, That fro all greuaunce hys sorowes myght appese. 8 And there withall he wrote hem in hys mynde, So stedfastly with deuoute and hy corage, That neuer a day a worde he foryate behynde, But seyde hem entyerly in-to hys last age, Hys olde gyltes bothe to a soft and swage Aftyr hyr matyns, as was hys appetyte, To sey hem euer was hys most delyte. 9 Therto his dylygence with all hys hert &amp; myght, And forthe contynuyd in his deuoutest wyse, Tyll at last hit befell apon a nyght The hoole Couent at mydngyht gan aryse, As ys here vsage, to do to God seruyse, So when they were assemblyd there in generall, The suppryour beholdyng aboute ouer all, 10 As ys hys offyce that noone of theym were absent, But of Dan Ioos he cowde nowyse aspy, He roose hym up and priuyly he went In-to hys chambre, and there he fond hym ly Deede as a stoone, and lowde he gan to cry “Helpe,” quoth he, “for the loue of oure lady bryght, Dan Ioos oure brother ys sodenly dede to-nyght.” 11 The couent anone gan renne halfe in a drede, Tyll they had behylde when passyd was here afray Owte of hys mowthe, a Roose boothe sprang and sprede, Fresshe in his coloure as any floure in May, And other tweyne out of his eyen gray Of hys eares as many full fresshly flowryng, That neuer yet in gardyne half so feyre gan spryng. 12 Thys rody Roose they haue so long beholde That sprang for his mowthe, tyll they haue espyed Full fayre grauen, in lettres of bornyd golde, Marie full curyously as hit ys specyfyed, In bookes oolde, and anone they haue hem hyed Vnto the temple, with lawde &amp; hye solempnyte, Beryng the corse that all men myght hit se. 13 Whyche they kepte in ryalte &amp; hy perfeccioune Seuyn dayes in the tempel there beyng present, Tyll thre bysshops of fame &amp; gret renoune Were comyn thedyr, ryght with deuout entent, And many another clerk with hem by oon assent, To se thys myracle of thys lady bryght Seying in thys wyse, with all her hert and myght, 14 “Lawde, honour, pryce and hygh reuerence Eternally be to thee .O. heuynly Iuge, And to thy modyr that of her gret benyuolence, Preserueth from heuynes in this derke deluge, That doone her magnyfy and ys her hoole refuge More then they serue sche quyteth a thowsand folde, Hyr passyng goodnes of vs may nat be tolde:” 15 Thus when these bysshops &amp; clerkis many oon Had thankyd God, as ferforth as they can, And thys lady that hathe thys grace ydoon, So full of ioy and blysse was euery man Of thys myracle, that syth the world began Yet herde I neuer in Roundell, prose ne ryme, Of halfe the gladnes þat was withyn hem that tyme, 16 Sone aftyr thys her iorney gan they holde, Eche in hys syde, in-to hys propre place, Ryght as they fonde ouerall so haue they tolde, Of thys holy Monke, O lady full of grace! Now well ys hym, that can hys hert enbrace, To loue the best and chaunge for no new, That art so feythfull thow canst nat be vntrew. 17 O ye fresshe louers, that lyuyn euer in doublenesse, And hurt your-self full oft with your owne knyfe, Your wofull ioy ys medlyd ay with byttyrnesse, Now glad, now sory, now lyte, now pensyfe, Thus with your-self ye fall euer at stryfe, Betwene two wawes ay possyd to and fro, That in contraryosnes ye stryuyn euyr mo. 18 Youre blynde fantasyes now in hertes weyue, Of chyldysshe vanyte and let hem ouerslyde, And loueth this lady, that can nowyse deceyue, She ys so stedfast of hert in euery syde, That for your nedys so modyrly can prouyde And for your poysy these lettres fyue ye take, Of thys name Maria oonly for hys sake. 19 That for youre trauayle so well [will] yow auaunce, Nat as these wemen on ye whyche ye doon delyte, That fedyn yow all day with feynyd pleasaunce, Hyd vndyr tresoun with many wordys whyte, But bet then ye deserue she woll yow quyte, And for ye shall nat labour all in veyne, Ye shall have heuen there ys nomore to seyne; 20 Whos passyng goodnes may nat be comprehendyd, In mannys prudence fully to determyne, She ys so parfyte she cannat be amendyd, That ay to mercy and pyty doth enclyne. Now benygne lady that dedyst oure sorowes fyne In honour of the that done thy psalmes rede As was Dan Ioos, so quyte hem for theyre mede. Amen. 66. GLORIOSA DICTA SUNT DE TE. [BALADE OF OURE LADYE BY LIDEGATE] [From Trin. Coll. Camb.

Þe name is called, lyche as I can knowe, Þe dwelling place of þe deyitee, Vppon þe wallis, wryten al by rowe, Gloryous thingis beon songe and sayde of þee. 2 Þis was þe songe which Dauid with his harpe Sang vpon þe mountes of Syon, With nootes sweete and warbles touched sharpe Fer frome þe floodes of felle Babylon. Þis cytee bylt with many a prescious stoone, Stoones of vertue, moost ryche vpon to see, And his refreyde resouned euer in oon, Gloryous thinges beon song and sayde of þee. 3 Of alle cytees, who þat serche neghe or ferre, In what regyounes þat men ryde or goo, Þou art þy-self þe bright loode-sterre, Mankyndes lyff, to guye in wele and woo; Nazareth, but not Iherico, Þe prophetes gaf to þye natyvyte, To make vs sure ageynst our mortal foo Howe gloryous thinges beon songe and sayde of þee. 4 Auctours whylome gaf a prys to Troye Laude and honnour and comendacyoun In Remembraunce of þeyre olde Ioye Þat whylome was wel vsed in þat tovne, And eeke of Roome for domynacyoun, Cytees þat tyme of mooste souereyntee; But al þeyre booste may nowe be layde adowne, So gloryous thinges beo sayde and song of þee. 5 Þou art þe cyte mooste kouþe in euery cooste, Of God þe Fader chosen by myracle For þy clennesse vnto þe Hooly Gooste To beon alloone chevest habytacle, Whos meeknesse made þer was noon obstacle To cause him light frome his souereyne see And descende in-to þy tabernacle, Howe gloryous thinges beon seyde and songe of þee! 6 Auctoures also maken mencyoun, As þey in bookes wel reherce konne, Þowe were by meryte and by deuocion Þe table of golde offred to þe sonne, Which fisshers foonde and with þeyre nettes wonne And hit presented vn-to þe deytee Of Phebus, which, with noo skyes donne Eclippseþe neuer, for he sprang oute of þee. 7 Iepte whylome, as maked is memorye, Made of his doughter an oblacyoun Vndescretly, for his gret victorye,— Saynt Austyn wryt, for lacking of resoun; But Ioachim of pleyne entencyoun And hooly Anne þy pure virginytee Offred vn-to God of oon affeccyoun; Howe gloryous thinges beon sayde and songe of þee. 8 Þou art þe temple and þe chosen toure Moost stedfastly founded on clennesse, Where Cryst Ihesu, oure blessed saueour, Chees for tabyde for þyne hoolynesse; What called him dovne but þy gret meeknesse Tenclyne his godheed to þyne humylytee I am to Rude, O lady! for texpresse Howe gloryous thinges beon song and sayde of þee. 9 Þer was a Cyte precelling alle tovnes Whos gret beaute no masoun might amende, Called þe Cyte of strong Chaumpyouns, Whos chaaste walles Sapyence list ascende, Whos worthynesse no clerk cane comprehende; Reclynatorye of þe Trinytee, Reffuge of synners, whanne þat þey offende, Howe gloryous thinges beon songe and sayde of þee! 10 Þy blessed cytee was hyeghly glorefyed, Ecclesiastes cane þe sooþe telle, And of þe lord moost Inly sanctefyed, In which him-self list abyde and dwelle, Owte of þe which, besydes a sacred welle, To saue mankynde of lyf þer sprang a tree, Whos hoolsome fruyt alle fruytes doþe excelle So gloryous thinges beon seyde and songe of þee. 11 In þat cytee þe lord chose for to rest, Recorde I taake of prudent Ysaye, Sought it out and foonde it was þe best And þe prophete cleped Sophonye, In his forsight list wel specefye, “Þis is,” quod he, “þe gloryous fayre cytee Whome al þe warld of right shal magnefye,” So gloryous thinges beon songe and sayde of þee. 12 Ezechiel expressed with his mouþe Þat he saughe a Cyte moost hevenly, Whiche was drawyng miche into þe southe, With-Inne þe which, he telleþe ful goostly, Þat þe lover is serched comunly, Þe lord of lordes þat haþe heghe seuereyntee, And in his wryting he meneþe truly Þe gloryous thinges sayde and songe of þee. 13 Þowe were þe sterre of þe morowe gray, Passing alle oþer as in comparysoun, Þe fulle moone brighter þane þe day, Whylome called in þy concepcyoun; And cleerest sonne in þyn assumpcyoun, Alle derk skyes makyng for to flee, And brightest arke by conuersacion, So gloryous thinges beon sayde and songe of þee. 14 A thousand sheeldes, þe byble bereþe witnesse, Kyng Dauid hade honging in his tour, Of golde and perlle, fret with gret Rychesse, Made and devysed with dilygent labour, And sooþefastly, O goodely fresshe flour, Fayrest of fayre which sprang out of Iesse, A thousand vertues hast loken in þy boure, So gloryous thinges beon sayde and song of þee. 15 O braunche of Iuda! kyn to Israel! Of hoolynesse verray Incomparable, Lyk to Sarra daughter of Raguell, Whiche in hir tyme off herte was so stable Þat neuer man was to hir acceptable, Til þaungel made Thobye hir to se; But þy clennesse chaaste and Inmutable To God was offred, as Prophetis sing of þee. 16 And amonges wymmen, to rekken hem alle, Þou were moost parfyt and hooly of þy lyff, Suche haboundaunce of grace is to þee falle To beon alloone mayde, moder and wyff, Right soletarye and contemplatyff, Lyche hooly Iudith, to saven hir citee, Madest Olypherne for to leese his lyff, Þe feonde outraying, þus prophetes wryte of þee. 17 For þou hast oppressed dovne his heed With al his dreedful venyme serpentyne, Putte mankynde oute of mortal dreed, Whane God his gold dewe made doune enclyne, Þe dewe of grace, in þy brest to shyne, Oute of oure thraldome to get vs lyberte; Nowe let þy mercy oure synnes vndermyne, Sith gloryous thinges bee seyde and songe of þee. 18 Of goostely helthe chevest restoratyff, Of sinful men þe consolacion, In fygure called þe helsome tre of lyff And sacred temple of Kyng Salamon; Þe Busshe vnbrende of pure affeccion, Þe halowed Ark contening thinges three, Þe Ourne and manna, þe yerde eeke of Aron, Howe gloryous thinges beon songe and seyde of þee. 19 Þy goostely brightnesse may souffre noon eclipse, But shyne ay bright, and neuer wexen olde, Þou art þe Cytee which in þappocolips Whylome Saint Iohan saughe pauyed al with golde Whos gret beaute may not beo sayde ne tolde, Superlatyf bove oþer of degree, Called þe qweene of þat hevenly holde, How gloryous thinges beon song and sayde of þee. 20 Þou art in fygure þe mansyoun royal Þat I of spake, remembred by Saint Iohan, On chastytee founded was þe wal, Arered on heght with many a precyous stoone; Twelve þer were, to rekon hem oon by oon, Þe precyous Iasper of virginyte Set in þe grounde first of euerych oon, Iaspe of virginite. Howe gloryous thinges beon sayde and songe of þee. 21 And aldernexst, I haue it weel in mynde, Þe werk tenbelisshe of þy conscyence, Þer was eeke sette þe goodely saphyre ynde, Saphire of trouþe. Tavoyde þe fraude of feondes vyolence, And vnkynde heetes of ffeuerous pestylence Þou canst asswage, of grace and of pytee, With oure demerytes þy mercy lat dispence, Sith gloryous thinges beon songe and seyde of þee. 22 O calceydoyne closed in clennesse! Calsydonie of clennesse. Which of nature power haste and might To ouercome, as clerkis cane expresse, Causis contrarye gouyn ageynst right, Wher-for O lady haue here to a sight,— Þou chosen charboncle of parfyte charytee!

Which of vertu awmentist þe rychesse, Whos glade stremes beon moste comfortable To mysty eghen derked with blyndnesse, Refresshing folk feynted with werynesse, In þeyre vyage whanne þey wery be; Nowe towardes heven oure pilgrymage dresse Where gloryous thinges beon songe and sayde of þee. 24 O cleerest crystual þat first such grace haste wonne Beryle and cristal for light. Þat þe hooly goost in to þy brest alight, Right as þe beryle resceyueþe of þe sonne Fyre of his nature, in euery mannes sight, Þe parfyte beemys so persaunt were and bright Of God provyded by his eternytee, Þis wreched worlde to gladen and to light Howe gloryous thinges beon songe and sayde of þee. 25 O perytot! þe which as clerkes seyþe, Peritot magnefied of god.

By influence of þyne heghe goodnesse Causest in hertis þat beon sadde and truwe, To founde him-self on parfyt stabilnesse O stoone of vertu causing sobirnesse With outen chaunge or mutabilytee; Ruwe of pytee vpon oure wrecchednesse Sith gloryous thinges beon songe and sayde of þee. 28 Of patryarkes þonnour and þe glorye, And of prophetes þe chief foundacion, To þappostilles laude to þeyre victorye, And to þe martirs þe laureal renoun, Of confessours þe consolacioun, And to virgynes myrrour of Chastite To þy servants sheelde and proteccion, Howe gloryous thinges beon songe and sayde of þee. 29 O blessed lady! qweene of þe heghe heven, Whome clerkes calle þemperyse of helle Sitting ful fer above þe sterres seven, And qweenes alle in honnour doist excelle, Be þou oure socour, our vyces to expelle, Þat called art of God þe cheef cytee, Whane we passe hens, by mercy make vs dwelle Where gloryous thinges be sayde and song of þee. 67. QUIS DABIT MEO CAPITI FONTEM LACRIMARUM? Here begynneth a lamentacioun of our Lady Maria. [MS. Bodley Laud Misc. 683, leaves 78–81.] 1 Who shal yeve vn-to myn hed a welle Of bitter terys my sorwys to compleyne, Or a gret condewit of troubly watrys ffelle Down to dystylle fro myn Eyen tweyne, To shewe the constreynt of my dedly peyne Whan I, allas! be-holde and dyd see My dere sone bleede in euery veyne, Atwix two thevys nayllyd to a tre? 2 Who shal of wepyng geve me suffysaunce, Or to my sobbyng who shal me terys ffynde, To se my Ioie myn hertis hih plesaunce My soote sone, that was to me so kynde, Railled with red blood as sap doth thoruh the rynde, Thorugh his enmyes vengable Cruelte; Dirkened with deth his eien now maad blynde, Atwix two thevys naylled to a tre. 3 My Ioie, my lyght, my lanterne moost Entyeer, This hevenly Phebus is clypsed of his lyght, This Esperus hath hyd hys bemys Cleer And is of newe corteyned ffro my sight. Whan shal this day-sterre shewe me his bemys briht, To clere the trouble of myn adversyte? Parde, the Iewys do me to gret vnright To naylle my sone allas on to a tre. 4 O alle ye douhtren of Ierusaleem, Haue som compassioun of my sihes deepe, Nat lyk the gladnesse wich I hadde in Bedleem, Kom neer of routhe and helpe me for to wepe, A swerd of deth doth thoruh myn herte crepe, I ffele it ffull weell of modyrly pyte. Craunpisshed with deth swownyng I do slepe, To se my sone thus naylled to a tre. 5 O gentyl pryncessis and ladyes of Estaat, And ye virgynes, in your entent most clene, To yeve me comfort that stonde al desolaat Renneth a pas to se the woundys grene Of your trewe spouce, of bledyng pale &amp; lene; And aduertyseth and hath now rowthe on me, Feynt for to stonde, for how sholde I sustene To se my sone thus naylled to a tre? 6 And alle ye women, tappese myn hewynesse, Remembreth the processe of his dredful victorie; Se, to-for Pilat, by many fals wytnesse How he was dampned in the Concystorye. Radde ye euere Or sauh in his storye Of any sorwes that may compared be On to the sorwys grave in my memorye To se my sone thus naylled to a tre? 7 And yif ye lyke of routhe for to leere, And at my terys yeve ye nat dysdeyne, But of compassioun meekly lyst to heere, How a sharp swerd myn hert hath corve on tweyne, A swerd of sorwe thoruh perced euery veyne, Now deth hath slayn my sone, and spareth me, Allas! fro wepyng how sholde I me restreyne To se my sone thus naylled to a tre? 8 O peple onkynde! why wil ye noon heed take To se the lord of helle, erthe, and hevene, Meek as a lamb, thus offred for your sake, To sle the dragoun with his hedys sevene, Dauntyng the power of his Infernal levene, Out of his thraldam to make yow go ffre, With many mo wowndys than any man can nevene Whan he at Calvary was naylled to a tre? 9 Is it a mervayll or any maner wonder Though I ful offte swowne for grevaunce? Was euere moder outher here or yonder, That for hyr Chyld ffelte more penaunce? Myn Inward sorwys can ffynde noon allegaunce, Ech hour renewyng, it wyl noon other be, Whan-euere it cometh to my remembraunce How that my sone was naylled to a tre. 10 The lemys ffeble vp-on my feet to stonde, Whanne I, allas, consydre and do be-holde This pitous mateer, that we han on honde, Ful lytell mervayll thouh myn herte colde, Myn handys craunpisshed, I may them nat vnfolde, To goon vpright I haue no ffoot nor kne, My peynes passe alle tormentys newe and olde To se my sone thus naylled to a tre. 11 Geyn the guyse of kynges riche crownes, My dere sone weryd a Crowne of thorn, Of gold and perle, ageyn ther stately gownes, Ageyn ther ridyng gret meyne them be-forn, My sone on ffoote hath his cros I-born; Ageyn ther setys of stones and perre, And for mankynde that was thoruh synne lorn, He, pore and naked, was naylled to a tre. 12 Ageyn the beddys, stately, hih, and soffte, Of worldly pryncys with pelwys for their hed, Vp-on the roode my sone was lyfft a-loffte, With bloody purpil hys mantel maad al reed, Marked with a spere and for mankynde ded, And grucched nothyng thoruh his humylyte, To me noon ese, whanne that I took heed, And sauh my sone thus naylled to a tre. 13 For Adamhis synne thus was my sone slayn, Thoruh the olde serpent by thassent of Eve, When thoruh my meknesse mankynde was maad ffayn, Hir name turned ther thraldam to Releve, And Gabryell kam, my meeknesse ffor to preve, Sent by on accord of al the Trynyte, But ful sore affter it dyd myn herte greve, Whanne I my sone sauh naylled to a tre. 14 For manhis love he faught a gret batayll, With his sevene hedys he outrayed the dragoun, Lyk myhty Sampson with-oute plate or mayll, In his strong ffyght he strangeled the lyoun, Thus was my sone mankyndys Champyoun, Thorugh his most myghty magnanymyte, As kyng and bysshop made his oblacyoun Vpon the hih auhter of the Roode tre, 15 My sonys suffraunce to Sathan was gret wrak, Whos gret meknesse dyd I nouh suffyse, Cleerly ffygured whanne that Ysaak Was by his ffader offred in sacryfyse, Nat dysobeying in no maner wyse, But lyk a lamb of lownesse lyst nat ffle, But most myn herte that tyme did agryse Whan I first sauh hym naylled to a tre. 16 He myhte be callid Eleasar the secounde, The champioun, moost myghty and notable, That gaf tholyfaunt his laste mortal wounde, (Machabeorum this story ys no ffable), And as Hercules, in his conquestis stable, Bar up the hevenys in his humanyte, For whom my sorwis wer maad most lamentable Whan I be-held hym thus naylled to a tre, 17 Thus deth with deth was outraied and brouht lowe, Mankyndys quarel maad vyctoryous, For thanne leviathan was bounde and over-throwe, Whan with his tryvmphes most synguler glorious, My sone had faught with his blood precyous, Conqueryd the dragoun for al his ffel pouste, And dryue hym hom to his Infernall hous, Whan first my sone was naylled to a tre. 18 Lat euery man in this mater take heede, And euery woman in this world a-lyve Come ner to me to seen his woundys bleede, His love, his deth, his kyndenesse to descryve, To se the mysteryes of his woundys ffyve, As bawme and tryacle of most souereynte Cleerly dystyllyng to fynde socour blyve, Down fro my sone [I]nayllyd to a tre. 19 Trust in his mercy and I wyl go be tween, And humbly knele be forn hys fface, For almankynde be medyatrix and mene, Of synful folk to releve the trespace, That he with vengaunce shal them nat manace, Lyk ther dysmeritees to shewe his cruelte, But shewe to them his mercy and his grace, That for ther love was naylled to a tre.

II. Testamentum in nomine Iesu. 31 The yeres passed of my tender youthe Of my fresshe Age sered the grennesse, Lust appalled, thexperience is kouthe, The onweldy Ioyntes starked with rudenesse, The cloudy sight mysted with dirkenesse, Without redresse, recure, or amendes, To me of death han brought in the kalendes. 32 Of myspent tyme a fole may weel compleyne, Thing impossible ageyn for to recure, Dayes lost in ydel no man may restreyne, Them to reforme by none aventure, Eche mortall man is called to the lure, Of deth, allas, vncerteyne the passage, Whos chief marynere is called croked age. 33 One of his bedeles, named feblenesse, Cam with his potent in stede of a mace, Somouned me and after cam sekenesse, Malencolyk, erthely, and pale of face, With ther waraunt these tweyne can manace How deth of me his dewe dette soughte, And to a bed of langoure thei me brought. 34 Where onto me anoon ther did appere Whill that I lay, compleynynge in a trance, Clad in a mentell, a woman sad of chere, Blak was her abyte, sobre of countenaunce, Straunge of hir porte, froward of dalyaunce, Castyng here looke to meward in certeyne Lich of me she hadde but disdeyne. 35 This seid woman was called “remembraunce Of myspent tyme,” in youthes lustynesse, Whiche to recorde did me gret grevaunce, Than cam her suster, named “pensifnesse For olde surfetes,” and gan onto me dresse A wooful bylle, which brought vnto [my] mynde My gret outrages, of long tyme left behynde. 36 Lyggyng alone, I ganne to ymagyne How with .iiij. tymes departed is the yere, First how in ver, the soyle tenlumyne, Buddes gyn open ageyne the sunne clere, The bavme vpreysed most souereyne and entere, Out of the rote doth naturally ascende With new lyffre, the bareyne soil tamende. 37 The honysoucle, the fresshe primerolles, Ther leves splaye at Phebus vprysyng, Thamerous foules with motytes and carolles, Salue this sesoun euery mor[we]nyng, Whan Aurora hir licour distyllyng Sent on herbes the perely dropis shene, Of siluer dewes tenlumyne with the grene. 38 This tyme of Ver is named of grenesse, Tyme of ioye, of gladnesse, and disporte, Tyme of growyng, chief moder of freshnesse, Tyme of reioysyng, ordeyned for counforte, Tyme whan tyme maketh his resorte In geryshe Marche toward the Ariete, Our Emyspery to gladen with his hete. 39 Whiche sesoun prikkes fressh corages, Reioyseth bestes walking in ther pasture, Causeth byrdes to syngen in ther cages, Whanne blood reneweth in euery creature, Sum obseruance doyng to nature, Which is of ver called chief pryncesse, And vnder God ther worldly Emp[e]resse. 40 And for this lusty sesoun agreable Of gladnesse hath so gret avauntage, Be convenyent resoun full notable, Therto ful wel resembleth chyldes age, Quyk, grene, fressh, and delyuer of corage, For ryght as ver ay moreth in grenesse, So doth childhode in amorous lustynesse. 41 This quykyng sesoun, nutrityf and good, Of his nature hath tweyne qualitees, Of hote and moyst, which long also to blode, In ther ascencyoun vpward by degrees: Of kyndly ryght, the whiche propirtees, By natural hete and temperat moysture, Rekened in childhode .xiij. yeer doth endure. 42 Thus in .vj. thynges be order men may seen Notable accord and lust convenience, Blod, eyre, and ver, south, and meridien, And age of chyldhood by naturall assistence, Which, whill thei stonde in ther fressh premynence, Hete and moysture directeth ther passages, With grene fervence to force yong corages. 43 First Zepherus with his blastes sote Enspireth ver with newe buddes grene, The bawme ascendeth out of euery rote, Causyng with flowres ageyn the sunne shene May among mon[e]thes sitt like a quene, Hir suster Apryll watryng hir gardeynes With holsom shoures shad in the tender vynes. 44 This tyme of Ver Flora doth hir cure, With soleyne motlees passyng fressh and gay, Purpel colours wrought be dame nature, Mounteyns, vales, and medewes for tarraye, Hir warderobe open list not to delaye Large mesure to shewe out, and to shede Tresoures of fayre, whiche she doth possede. 45 This sesoun, Ver, most plesaunt to childhode, With hir chapelettes grene, white, and rede, In whiche tyme the newe yonge blode Hote and moyste ascendeth vp in dede, Reioyssyng hertes as it abrode doth sprede, Wenyng this sesoun among ther myrthes alle Sholde neuer discrecen nor appalle, 46 The variaunt sesoun of this stormy age Abraydeth euere on newefangelnesse, Now frounyng chiere, now fressh of visage, Now glad, now lyght, now trouble and hevynesse; Wylde as an herte, nowe mornyng for sadnesse, Stormyssh as Marche, with chaunges ful sodeyne, After cleer shynyng to turne and make it reyne. 47 Of this sesoun lust holte rene and brydell, Selde or neuere abydyng in o poynte; Now passyng besy, nowe dissolute, now ydell; Now a good felowe, now all out of ioynte; Now smothe, now stark, now like an hard purpoynt; Now as the peys of a diall goth, Now gerysh glad, and anoon after wroth. 48 Liche as in ver men gretly them delyte To beholde the beaute souerayne Of these blosemes, somme blewe, rede, and white, In whos fresshenesse no colour may atteyne, But thanne vnwarly cometh a wynde sodeyne, For no fauour list not for to spare Fresshnesse of braunches, for to make hem bare. 49 This sesoun ver stant neuer in no certeyne, For summe on houre though Phebus freshly shyne, In Marches wederes it sodeynly wyll reyne, Which of the day all dirkenesse doth declyne, And semblably a lyknesse to dyffyne, Men sen chyldren of byrth[e] yong and grene, Buryed withinne the yeres fiftene. 50 When Ver is fresshest of blosmes and of floures, An vnware storme his fresshnessse may appayre, Who may withstonde the sterne sharpe schoures Of dethes powere, where hym list repayre? Though fetures fresshe, angelyke, and fayre Shewe out in chyldhode as ony crystall clere, Deth can difface hem withynne .xv. yeer. 51 Veres sesoun doth but a while abide Skarsly iij. monethes he holdeth here soiour; The age of chyldhode, rekene on the tother syde, In hys encrese vp growyng as a floure, But whan that deth manaseth with his shour, In suche case he canne no more defence Than croked age in his most impotence. 52 Ver and eche sesoun mut by processe fade, In ver of age may be no sekernesse, Eche hath his houres, hevy and eke glade, Ther sesouns meynt with ioye and hevynesse, Now fayr, now foule, now helth, now sekenesse, To shewe a maner liknesse and ymage, Our dwellyng here is but a pilgrymage. 53 And for my part, I can remembre weell Whan I was gladdest in that fresshe sesoun, Lyke brotel glasse, not stable nor like stell, Fer out of harre, wilde of condicioun, Ful geryssh, and voyde of all resoun, Lyk a phane, ay turnyng to and fro, Or like an orloge whan the peys is goo. 54 Youe to onthryfte and dissolucioun, Stode onbrydeled of all gouernaunce, Whiche remembryng, be meke confessyoun, Now with my potent to fynde allegeaunce, Of olde surfetes, contrite with repentaunce, To the Iesu, I make my passage, Rehersyng trespaces don in my tender age. 55 But to directe be grace my matere, Mekely knelyng, Iesu, in thy presence, I me purpose to gynne with prayere, Vnder thi mercyfull fructuous influence, So thou Iesu of thy benevolence, To my requestes be mercyfull attendaunce, Graunt or I deye, shryft, hosel, repentaunce. 56 My wrecched lyf tamenden and correcte I me purpose, with support of thi grace, Thy deth thy passioun thy ? crosse shall me directe, Which suffredest deth, Iesu, for our trespace.

Iesus. 80 Duryng the tyme of this sesoun Ver, I mene the sesoun of my yeres grene, Gynnyng fro chyldhode strecched vp so fer To the yeres accounted ffull fyftene, Bexperyence, as it was weel sene, The geryssh sesoun, straunge of condiciouns, Disposed to many vnbrydeled passiouns. 81 Voyd of resovn, youe to wilfulnesse, Froward to vertu, of thryfte take litel hede, Loth to lerne, loued no besynesse, Saue pley or merth, straunge to spelle or rede, Folowyng alle appetytes longyng to childhede, Lyghtly turnyng, wylde and selde sad, Wepyng for now?t, and anone after glad. 82 For litel wroth to stryue with my felawe, As my passiouns did my brydell lede, Of the yerd sumtyme I stood in awe, To be skowred, that was al my drede; Loth toward skole, lost my tyme in dede, Lyke a yong colt that ran without brydell, Made my frendes ther good to spend in ydell. 83 I had in custome to come to skole late, Nat for to lerne but for a contenaunce, With my felawes redy to debate, To Iangle or Iape was sett all my pleasaunce; Wherof rebuked this was my chevesaunce, To forge a lesyng, and thervpon to muse, Whanne I trespaced, my-selven to excuse. 84 To my better did no reuerence, Of my sovereynes gaf no force at all, Wex obstinat by Inobedience, Ran in-to gardeynes, apples ther I stall; To gadre frutes, spared nedir hegge nor wall, To plukke grapes In other mennes vynes Was more redy, than for to sey matynes. 85 My lust was all to skorne folke and jape, Shrewed turnes euer among to vse, To skoffe and mowen like a wantoun ape, Whan I dyd euele, other I koude accuse, My wyttes fyve in wast I did alle vse, Redier cheristones for to telle Than gon to chirche, or here the sacryng belle. 86 Loth to ryse, lother to bedde at eve, With vnwasshe hondes redy to dyner, My pater noster, my crede, or my beleve, Cast atte cok, lo, this was my maner! Wawed with eche wynd, as doth a reedspere, Snybbed of my frendes, sucche tecches tamende, Mad deef ere, list not to them attende. 87 A chyld resemblyng which was not lyke to thryve, Froward to God, rekles in his seruyce, Loth to correccioun, slough my-selue to shryve, All good thewes redy to despice, Chief belweder of [feynyd] truandice, This is to mene, myself I coude feyne, Sike like a truant, and felt no maner peyne. 88 My port, my pas, my foot allwey vnstable, My loke, myn eyen, vnsure and vagabound, In alle my werkes sodeynly chaungeable, To all good thewes contrarye I was founde, Now ouersadd, now mornyng, now iocounde, Wilfull, rekles, made stertyng as a hare, To folowe my lust for no man wold I spare. 89 Entryng this tyme into relygioun, Onto the plowe I put forth myne hond, A yere complete made my professioun, Consideryng litel charge of thilke bond, Of perfeccioun ful gode exaumple I fond, Ther techyng good, in me was [all] the lake, With Lothes wyf I loked often abak. 90 Taught of my maystres be vertuous disciplyne My loke restreyne, and kepe clos my syght, Of blyssed Benet to folowe the doctryne, And bere me lowly to euery maner wyght, Be the aduertence of myn Inward syght, Cast to godward of hole affeccioun, To folowe thempryses of my professioun. 91 His holy rewle was onto me rad, And expouned in ful notable wyse, Be vertuous men, religious and sad, Ful weel experte, discrete, prudent, and wys, Of observaunces of many gostly empryse; I herd all weel, but towchyng to the dede, Of that thei taught I toke litel hede! 92 Of religioun I wered a blak habite, Only outward as be apparence, To folowe that charge sauoured but fullyte, Saue be a maner connterfete pretence; But in effecte ther was none existence, Like the image of Pygmalyon, Shewed lyfly, and was made but of ston. 93 Vpon the ladder, with staves thryes thre, The .ix. degrees of vertuous mekenesse Called in the reule grees of humylite, Wheron tascende my feet me lyst not dresse, But be a maner feyned fals humblenesse, So couertly, whan folkes were present, On to shewe outward, another in myn entent. 94 First, where as I forsook myne owne wylle, Shette with a look of obedience, Tobeye my souereynes, as it was ryght &amp; skylle, To folowe the skole of perfy?t pacience, To myn Eymes doon worshep and reuerence,— Folowyng the reuers, toke all another weye, What I was boden, I koude weel disobeye. 95 With tonge at large and brotel conscyence, Ful of wordes, disordinat of language, Rekeles to kepe my lyppes in silence, Mouth, eyen, and eres token ther avauntage, To haue ther cours onbrydeled be outrage, Out of the reynes of attemperaunce, To sensualyte gaf alle the gouernaunce. 96 Wacche out of tyme, ryot and dronkenesse, Vnfructuous talkyng, Intemperat diete, To veyn fables I did myn eres dresse, Fals detraccioun among was to me swete, To talke of vertu me thought it was not mete, To my corage nor my compleccioun, Nor nat that sowned toward perfeccioun. 97 One with the firste to take my disporte, Last that aros to come to the quere, On contemplacioun I fond but small comforte, Holy histories did to me no chier,— I savoured more in good wyne that was clere,— And euery houre my passage for to dresse, As I seyd erst, to ryot or excesse. 98 Kowde grucch, And fond no cause why, Causeles ofte compleynyng on my fare, Geyn my correcciouns answered frowardly, Withoute reuerence, list no man to spare, Of all vertu and pacience I was bare, Of rekles youthe list non hede to take, What Cryst Iesu suffred for my sake. 99 Which now remembrying in my later age, Tyme of my childhode, as I reherse shall, Wythinne .xv. holdyng my passage, Myd of a cloyster, depicte vpon a wall, I savgh a crucifyx, whos woundes were not smalle, With this [word] “vide,” wrete there besyde, “Behold my mekenesse, O child, and leve thy pryde.” 100 The which word, whan I dyd vndirstond, In my last age takyng the sentence, Theron remembryng, my penne I toke in honde, Gan to wryte with humble reuerence, On this word, “vide,” with humble diligence, In remembraunce of Crystes passioun, This litel dite, this compilacioun. IESUS. Vide. 101 Beholde, o man! lyft vp thyn eye, and see What mortall peyne I suffre for thi trespace, With pietous voys I crye, and sey to the, Beholde my woundes, behold my blody face, Beholde the rebukes that do me so manace, Beholde my enemyes that do me so despice, And how that I to reforme the to grace, Was like a lambe offred in sacryfice. 102 Behold the paynemes of whom that I was take, Behold the cordes with whiche þat I was bounde, Behold the Armoures which made my herte to quake, Beholde the gardeyn in which þat I was founde, Behold how Iudas toke xxx?? pens rounde, Beholde his tresoun, beholde his couetyse, Behold how I with [many a] mortall wounde, Was like a lambe offred in sacrifice. 103 Se my discyple which that hath me sold, And se this feyned fals salutacioun, And se the monye which that he hath told, And se his kyssing and fals decepcioun, Behold also the compassed fals tresoun, Take as a thef with lanternes in ther guyse, And afterward for mannes redempcioun, Was like a lambe offered in sacrifice. 104 Behold to Cayphas how I was presented, Behold how Pilat lyst ?eue me no respite, Behold how bysshopes were to my deth assented, And se how Herawde had me in despite, And like a fool how I was clad in whight, Drawn as a feloun in most cruell wyse, And last of alle, I, after ther delyght, Was like a lambe offered in sacryfice. 105 Behold the mynystres which had me in kepyng, Behold the peler and the ropes stronge, Where I was bounde my sydes dovn bledyng, Most felly bete with [theire] skorges long Behold the batayle that I did vnderfonge, The bront abydyng of ther mortall empryse, Thorgh ther accusyng and ther sklaundres wrong, Was like a lambe offered in sacryfice. 106 Behold and se the hatefull wrecchednesse, Put ageyn me to my confusioun, Meyn eyen hyd and blended with derkenesse, Bete and eke bobbed by fals illusioun, Salued in skorn be ther fals knelyng dovn, Behold al this, and se the mortal guyse, How I only, for mannes saluacioun, Was like a lombe offered in sacryfice. 107 Se the witnesse be whom I was deceyved, Behold the Iuges that gaf my Iugement, Behold the crosse that was for me devysed, Behold my body with betyng all torent, Behold the people which of fals entent, Causeles dyd ageyn me ryse, Whiche like a lambe of malys Innocent, Was like a lambe offered in sacryfice. 108 Behold the woman that folowed me aferre, That sore wept whan I thus was assayled, Behold the Iewes whiche be ther cruel werre, Han my body vnto the cros I-nayled, Behold my tormentes most sharply apparayled, Atwene to theves put to my Iuyse; Behold how mychel my deth hath eke avayled, That was for man offered in sacryfice. 109 Behold the spere most sharply grounde &amp; whette, Myn herte wounded vpon the ryght syde, Beholde the reed spyre galle and eysel fett, Behold the skornynges which þat I did abyde; And my .v. woundes that were made so wyde, Which no man list of rewthe to aduertyse; And thus I was of mekenesse ageyn pryde, For mannes offence offered in sacryfice. 110 Se my disceples, how thei haue me forsake, And fro me fled almost euerychon, Se how they slepte and lyst not with me wake, Of mortall drede they lefte me alle alone; Except my moder and my cosyn Seynt Iohn, My deth compleynyng in most doolfull wyse, Se, fro my crosse they wold neuer goon, For mannes offence whan I did sacryfice. 111 Se how that I was Iuged to the deth, Se Baraban gon at his liberte, Se with a spere Longeus me sleth, Beholde two lycours distyllyng dovn fro me, Se blood and water by mercifull plente, Rayle be my sydes, which ought Inow suffyce To man whan I vpon the rood tree, Was like a lambe offered in sacrifice. 112 Behold the knyghtes which be ther froward chaunce Sat for my clothes at the dees to play; Behold my modyr swownyng for grevaunce, Vpon the crosse whan she sawe me deye; Beholde the sepulcre in which my bones lay, Kepte with strong wacche til I did aryse, Of helle gates, se how I brake the keye, And gaf for man my blood in sacryfice. 113 And geyn thi pryde behold my gret mekenesse, Geyn thyn envie behold my charite, Geyn thi leccherye behold my chast clennesse, Geyn thi couetyse behold my pouerte, Atweene too thevys nayled to a tree, Rayled with reed blood, they lyst me so desguyse, Behold, O man! all this I did for the, Meke as a lambe offred in sacryfice. 114 Behold my loue, and gyf me thyn ageyn, Behold, I deyde thy raunsom for to paye, Se howe myn herte is open brode and pleyn, Thy gostly enemyes onely to affraye, An hardere batayle no man myght assaye, Of all tryumphes the grettest hye empryse, Wher-for, O man! no lenger to dismaye, I gaf for the my blood in sacryfice. 115 Turne home ageyn, thy synne do forsake, Behold and se yf ought be left behynde, How I to mercy am redy the to take, Gyf me thyn herte and be no more vnkynde; Thy loue and myn, togedyr do hem bynde, And late hem neuer parte in no wyse, Whan thou were lost, thy sowle ageyn to fynde My blod I offred for the in sacryfice. 116 Emprente thes thynges in thyn inward thought, And graue hem depe in thy remembraunce, Thynke on hem [wel], and forgete hem nowght, Al this I suffred to do the allegeaunce, And with my seyntes to yeve the suffisaunce, In the hevenly court for the I do devyse A place eternall, a place of all plesaunce, For which my blood I gaf in sacryfice. 117 And more my mercy to putte att a preef, To euery synnere that non ne shal it mysse, Remembre how I gaf mercy to the theef, Which hadde so longe trespaced and doon amys; Went he not frely with me to paradise? Have this in mende, how it is my guyse All repentaunt to bryng hem to my blysse, For whom my blood I gaf in sacryfice. 118 Tarye no lenger toward thyn herytage, Hast on thy weye and be of ryght good chere, Go eche day onward on thy pylgrymage, Thynke howe short tyme thou hast abyden here; Thy place is bygged aboue the sterres clere, Noon erthly palys wrought in so statly wyse, Kome on my frend, my brother most entere! For the I offered my blood in sacryfice! Amen. Explicit testamentum Johanis Lydgate. 69. A KALENDARE.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [MS. Bodl. Rawlinson B. 408, leaves 1–6.] Ianuarius.

A COMPLAINT, FOR LACK OF MERCY. [MS. Univ. Lib. Cam. Ff. 1. 6, leaves 152, back, to 153.] 1 Grettere mater of dol an[d] heuynesse, Noe more cause haith no man to complayne Than y, alas! wich langwysche yn sekenesse, And at myn herte abyde the dedely payne, Whiche daye and nyght dothe me so constreyne; Suche a cotydyan halt me so greuusly, And, worse than deth, my leche dothe disdeyne Me to recure, for lacke of mercy. 2 The salt teres that fro myn yen reyne, Theyre tyme spente yn wepyng, &amp; not els, Which may be called the petows flodes tweyne; And þe hede sprynge with his whofull welles Of dedly constreynte my corage so compellys, Lyke Nyobe and Myrra ffast by, Wiche wepten euer, as theyre story tellys, Withoute recure, for lacke of mercy. 3 Whate vayleth vertu wiche is not treteabill? Recure of sykenesse is hasty medecyne. Whate vayleth bewte which ys nat mercyabill? Whate vayleth a sterre when hit do nat schyne, Or grete poure that lyste nat to declyne His heres downe, to here pytusly Compleynt of nedy, whiche yn theyre payne Crye for recur, and there is no mercy. 4 Achilles swerde the egge was keruy[n]g, The plat therof was softe and recureabile; Wownded of þe egge was mortall yn werkyng, The fatall plate was medycynabill; And thof so be of feith þat ye be stable, Nere þat gode hope toke hede for my party, I nere but dede, pleynely, þis is no fable, Withoute recure, for lacke of mercy. 3. THE COMPLAINT OF THE BLACK KNIGHT. [From MS. Bodley Fairfax 16, leaves 20, back, to 30.] Complaynte of a Louers Lyfe. 1 In May, when Flora, the fressh[e] lusty quene, The soyle hath clad in grene, rede, and white; And Phebus gan to shede his stremes shene Amyd the Bole, wyth al the bemes bryght; And Lucifer, to chace awey the nyght, Ayen the morowe our orysont hath take, To byd[de] lovers out of her slepe awake, 2 And hertys heuy for to reconforte From dreryhed of heuy nyghtis sorowe: Nature bad hem ryse and [hem] disporte, Ageyn the goodly, glad[e], grey[e] morowe, And Hope also, with Saint Iohn to borowe Bad in dispite of Daunger and Dispeyre, For to take the holsome lusty eyre. 3 And wyth a sygh [I] gan for to abreyde Out of my slombre, and sodenly out stert As he, alas, that nygh for sorowe deyde, My sekenes sat ay so nygh myn hert. But for to fynde socour of my smert, Or attelest summe relesse of [my] peyn, That me so sore halt in euery veyn, 4 I rose anon, and thoght I wol[de] goon Vnto the wode, to her the briddes sing, When that the mysty vapour was agoon, And clere and feyre was the morownyng, The dewe also lyk syluer in shynyng Vpon the leves, as eny bavme suete, Til firy Tytan with hys persaunt hete 5 Had dried vp the lusty lycour nyw Vpon the herbes in [the] grene mede, And that the floures of mony dyuers hywe Vpon her stalkes gunne for to sprede, And for to splay[en] out her leves on brede Ageyn the sunne, golde-borned in hys spere, That dovn to hem cast hys bemes clere. 6 And by a ryuer forth I gan costey, Of water clere as berel or cristal, Til at the last I founde a lytil wey Tovarde a parke, enclosed with a wal In compas rounde; and by a gate smal, [W]ho-so that wolde, frely myght[e] goon In-to this parke, walled with grene stoon. 7 And in I went to her the briddes songe, Which on the braunches, bothe in pleyn [and] vale, So loude songe that al the wode ronge, Lyke as hyt sholde sheuer in pesis smale; And as me thoght[e] that the nyghtyngale Wyth so grete myght her voys gan out wrest, Ryght as her hert for love wolde brest. 8 The soyle was pleyn, smothe, and wonder softe, Al ouer-sprad wyth tapites that Nature Had made her-selfe, celured eke a-lofte With bowys grene, the flo[u]res for to cure, That in her beaute they may not longe endure Fro al assaute of Phebus feruent fere, Which in his spere so hote shone, and clere. 9 The eyre atempre, and the smothe wynde Of Zepherus, amonge the blosmes whyte, So holsomme was, and so norysshing be kynde, That smale buddes, and rounde blomes lyte, In maner gan of her brethe delyte, To yif vs hope [that] their frute shal take Ayens autumpne, redy for to shake. 10 I sawe ther Daphene, closed vnder rynde, Grene laurer, and the holsomme pyne, The myrre also, that wepeth euer of kynde, The cedres high, vpryght as a lyne, The philbert eke, that lowe dothe enclyne Her bowes grene to the erthe dovne Vnto her knyght icalled Demophovne. 11 Ther saw I eke [the] fressh[e] haw[e]thorne In white motele, that so soote doth smelle, Asshe, firre, and oke, with mony a yonge acorne, And mony a tre mo then I can telle; And me beforne I sawe a litel welle, That had his course, as I gan be-holde, Vnder an hille, with quyke stremes colde. 12 The grauel golde, the water pure as glas, The bankys rounde the welle environyng, And softe as veluet the yonge gras, That ther vpon lustely gan s[pr]yng, The sute of trees a-bout[e] compassyng Her shadowe cast, closyng the wel[le] rounde, And al the erbes grovyng on the grounde. 13 The water was so holsom, and so vertuous, Throgh myghte of erbes grovynge [ther] beside; Nat lyche the welle wher as Narci[ss]us Islayn was th[o]ro vengeaunce of Cupide, Wher so couertely he did[e] hide, The greyn of deth vpon ech[e] brynk, That deth mot folowe, who that euere drynk; 14 Ne lyche the pitte of the Pegace, Vnder Parnaso, wher poetys slept; Nor lyke the welle of [pure] chastite, Whiche as Dyane with her nymphes kept, When she naked in-to the water lept, That slowe Acteon with his ho[u]ndes felle, Oonly for he cam so nygh the welle. 15 But this welle, that I her reherse, So holsom was, that hyt wolde aswage Bollyn hertis, and the venym perce Of pensifhede, with al the cruel rage, And euermore refresh[e] the visage Of hem that were in eny werynesse Of gret labour, or fallen in distresse. 16 And I that [had] throgh daunger and disdeyn So drye a thrust, thoght I wolde assay To tast a draght of this welle or tweyn, My bitter langour yf hyt myght alay; And on the banke anon dovne I lay, And with myn hede into the welle I raght, And of the watir dranke I a good draght. 17 Wher-of me thoght I was refresshed wel Of the brynnyng that sate so nyghe my hert, That verely anon I gan to fele An huge part relesed of my smert; And therwith-alle anon vp I stert, And thoght I wolde walke[n] and se more, Forth in the parke and in the holtys hore. 18 And thorgh a launde as I yede apace, I gan about[e] fast[e] to be-holde; I fonde anon a delytable place, That was beset with trees yong and olde, Whos names her for me shal not be tolde, A-myde of which stode an erber grene, That benched was with colours nyw and clene. 19 This erber was ful of floures ynde, Into the whiche, as I beholde gan, Be-twex an hulfere and a wodebynde, As I was war, I sawe ther lay a man In blake and white colour, pale and wan, And wonder dedely also of his hiwe, Of hurtes greene, and fresh[e] woundes nyw; 20 And ouer-more destreyned with sekenesse, Besyde al this he was [ful] greuosly, For vpon him he had a hote accesse, That day be day him shoke ful petously, So that for constreynt of hys malady, And hertly wo, thus lyinge al alone, Hyt was a deth for to se him grone. 21 Wherof astonied my fote I gan with-drawe, Gretly wondring what hit myght[e] be, That he so lay and had[de] no felawe Ne that I coude no wyght with him se, Wherof I had routhe and eke pite; I gan anon, so softly as I coude, Amonge the busshes me priuely to shroude; 22 If that I myght in eny wise espye, What was the cause of his dedely woo, Or why that he so pitously gan crie On hys ffortune, and on his eure also; With al my myght I leyde an ere to, Euery worde to marke what he sayed[e], Out of his swogh among as he abreyde. 23 But first, yf I shal make mensyoun Of hys persone, and pleynly him discrive, He was in sothe, with-out excepcioun, To speke of manhod oon the best on lyve— Ther may no man ayein[es] trouthe stryve—, For of hys tyme, and of his age also, He proued was, ther men shuld haue ado. 24 For oon the best ther of brede and lengthe So wel ymade by good proporsioun, Yf he had be in his delyuer strengthe; But thoght and sekenesse wer occasioun, That he thus lay in lamentacioun, Gruffe on the grounde, in place desolate, Sole by him-self, aw[h]aped and amate. 25 And for me semeth that hit ys syttyng His wordes al to put in remembraunce, To me that herde al his compleynyng And al the grounde of his woful chaunce, Yf ther-with-al I may yow do plesaunce: I wol to yow, so as I can anone, Lych as he seyde, reherse[n] euerychone. 26 But who shal helpe me now to compleyn? Or who shal now my stile guy or lede? O Nyobe! let now thi teres reyn Into my penne, and eke helpe in this nede Thou woful Mirre, that felist my hert[e] blede Of pitouse wo, and my honde eke quake, When that I write for this mannys sake. 27 For vnto wo acordeth compleynyng, And delful chere vnto heuynesse, To sorow also sighing and wepyng, And pitouse morenyng vnto drerynesse, And who that shal write[n] of distresse, In partye nedeth to know[e] felyngly Cause and rote of al such malady. 28 But I, alas, that am of wytte but dulle And haue no knowyng of suche mater, For to discryve and wryte[n] at the fulle The wofull compleynt, which that ye shul here; But euen-like as doth a skryuener, That can no more what that he shal write, But as his maister beside dothe endyte: 29 Ryght so fare I, that of no sentement Sey ryght noght as in conclusioun, But as I herde, when I was present, This man compleyn[e] wyth a pytouse soun; For euen-lych, wythout addissyoun, Or disencrese, outher mor or lesse, For to reherse anon I wol me dresse. 30 And yf that eny now be in this place, That fele in love brennyng or fervence, Or hyndered were to his lady grace, With false tonges, that with pestilence Sle trwe men, that neuer did offence In worde ne dede, ne in their entent— Yf eny such be here now present, 31 Let hym of routhe ley to audyence With deleful chere, and sobre contenaunce, To here this man be ful high sentence, His mortal wo, and his perturbaunce Compleynyng, now lying in a traunce, With loke vp-cast, and [with ful] reuful chere, Theffect of which was as ye shal here. Compleynt. The thoght oppressed with inward sighes sore, The peynful lyve, the body langwysshing, The woful gost, the hert[e] rent and tore, The petouse chere pale in compleynyng, The dedely face lyke asshes in shynyng, The salt[e] teres that fro myn yen falle, Parcel declare grounde of my peynes alle. 33 Whos hert ys grounde to blede on heuynesse, The thoght resseyt of woo and of compleynt, The brest is chest of dule and drerynesse, The body eke so feble and so feynt, With hote and colde my acces ys so meynt, That now I shyuer for defaute of hete, And hote as glede now sodenly I suete. 34 Now hote as fire, now colde as asshes dede, Now hote for colde, [now colde] for hete ageyn, Now colde as ise, now as coles rede For hete I bren, and thus betwyxe tweyn I possed am, and al forcast in peyn, So that my hete pleynly as I fele Of greuouse colde ys cause euerydele. 35 This ys the colde of ynwarde high dysdeyn, Colde of dyspite, and colde of cruel hate; This is the colde that euere doth besy peyn, Ayen[e]s trouthe to fight[en] and debate; This ys the colde that wolde the fire abate Of trwe menyng, alas, the harde while; This ys the colde that will me begile. 36 For euere the better that in trouthe I ment, With al my myght feythfully to serue, With hert and al to be dilygent, The lesse thanke, alas, I can deserue. Thus for my trouthe Daunger doth me sterue; For oon that shuld my deth of mercie let, Hath made Dispite now his suerde to whet 37 Ayen[e]s me, and his arowes to file, To take vengeaunce of wilful cruelte, And tonges fals throgh her sleghtly wile Han gonne a werre that wol not stynted be, And fals Envye of wrathe, and Enemyte Haue conspired ayens al ryght and lawe, Of her malis, that Trouthe shal be slawe. 38 And Male-bouche gan first the tale telle, To sclaundre Trouthe of Indignacioun, And Fals-report so loude ronge the belle, That Mys-beleve and Fals-suspecioun Haue Trouthe brought to hys dannacioun, So that alas wrongfully he dyeth, And Falsnes now his place occupieth, 39 And entred ys in-to Trouthes londe, And hath therof the ful possessyoun. O ryghtful God! that first the trouthe fonde, How may thou suffre such oppressyoun, That Falshed shuld haue iurysdixioun In Trouthes ryght, to sle him gilt[e]les? In his fraunchise he may not lyve in pes. 40 Falsly accused, and of his foon for-iuged, Without ansuer, while he was absent, He damned was, and may not ben excused: For Cruelte satte in iugement Of Hastynesse with-out avisement, And bad Disdeyn do execute anon His iugement in presence of hys fon. 41 Atturney non ne may admytted ben To excuse Trouthe, ne a worde to speke; To Feyth or Othe the Iuge list not sen, Ther ys no geyn but he wil be wreke. O Lorde of Trouthe! to The I calle and clepe: How may Thou se thus in Thy presence, With-out[e] mercy mordred Innocence? 42 Now God! that art of Trouthe souereyn, And seest how I lye for Trouthe bounde, So sore knytte in loves firy cheyn, Euen at the deth thro-girt wyth mony a wounde, That lykly ar neuer for to sounde, And for my trouthe am damned to the dethe, And noght abide but drawe alonge the brethe: 43 Consider and se in thyn eternal sight, How that myn hert professed whilom was, For to be trwe with al my ful[le] myght Oonly to oon the which[e] now, alas! Of volunte, withoute more trespas, Myn accusurs hath taken vnto grace, And cherissheth hem my deth for to purchace. 44 What meneth this? what ys this wonder vre Of purveance, yf I shal hit calle, Of God of Love, that fals hem so assure, And trew, alas! dovn of the whele be falle? And yet in sothe this is the worst of alle, That Falshed wrongfully of Trouth hath the name, And Trouthe ayenwarde of Falshed bereth the blame. 45 This blynde chaunce, this stormy aventure In love hath most his experience; For who that doth with trouth[e] most his cure, Shal for his mede fynde most offence, That serueth love with al his diligence; For who can feyne vnder loulyhede, Ne fayleth not to fynde grace and spede. 46 For I loved oon ful longe sythe agoon With al my hert[e], body and ful[le] myght, And to be ded my hert[e] can not goon From his hest, but hold that he hath hight; Thogh I be banysshed out of her syght, And by her mouthe damned that I shal deye, Vnto my behest yet I wil euer obeye. 47 For euere sithe that the worlde began, Who so lyste loke[n] and in storie rede, He shal ay fynde that the trwe man Was put abake, wher-as the falshede I-furthered was; for Love taketh non hede To sle the trwe, and hath of hem no charge, Wher-as the fals goth frely at her large. 48 I take recorde of Palamides, The trwe man, the noble worthy knyght, That euer loved, and of hys peyne no relese, Not-withstondyng his manhode and his myght; Love vnto him did ful grete vnright, For ay the bette he did in cheualrye, The more he was hindred by Envye; 49 And ay the bette he dyd in euery place, Throgh his knyghthode, and [his] besy peyn, The ferther was he fro his ladys grace, For to her mercie myght he neuer ateyn; And to his deth he coude hyt not refreyn For no daunger, but ay obey and serue, As he best coude pleynly til he sterue. 50 What was the fyne also of Ercules, For al his conquest and his worthynesse, That was of strengthe alone pereles? For lyke as bokes of him list expresse, He set[te] pilers thro his high provesse, Away at Cades, for to signifie, That no man myght hym passe in cheualrie. 51 The whiche pilers ben ferre by-yonde Ynde Be-set of golde, for a remembraunce; And for al that was he sete behynde With hem that Love list febly avaunce; For [he] him set last vpon a daunce, Ayen[e]s whom helpe may no strife, For al his trouth[e] [?it] he lost his lyfe. 52 Phebus also for al his persaunt lyght, When that he went her in erthe lowe, Vnto the hert with [fresshe] Venus sight Ywounded was, th[o]ro Cupides bowe, And yet his lady list him not to knowe, Thogh for her love his hert[e] did[e] blede, She let him go, and toke of him non hede. 53 What shal I say of yong[e] Piramus? Of trwe Tristram for al his high renovne? Of Achilles or of Antonyus? Of Arcite or of him Palamovne? What was the ende of her passion But after sorowe dethe and then her graue. Lo her the guerdon that [thes] louers haue! 54 But false Iasoun with his doublenesse. That was vntrwe at Colkos to Mede, And Tereus, rote of vnkyndenesse, And with these two eke the fals Ene: Lo thus the fals, ay in oon degre, Had in love her lust and al her wille, And save falshed ther was non other skille. 55 Of Thebes eke [loo] the fals Arcite, And Demophon eke for his slouthe, They had her lust and al that myght delyte, For al her falshede and [hir] grete vntrouthe. Thus euer Love, alas, and that is routhe, His fals[e] legys furthereth what he may, And sleeth the trwe vngoo[d]ly day be day. 56 For trwe Adon was slayn with the bore Amyde the forest in the grene shade, For Venus love he felt al the sore. But Vulcanus with her no mercy made, The foule cherle had many nyghtis glade, Wher Mars her [worthy] knyght, her [trewe] man, To fynde mercy comfort noon he can. 57 Also the yonge fressh Ipomones, So lusty fre as of his corage, That for to serue with al his hert [he] ches Athalans, so feire of her visage; But Love, alas, quyte him so his wage With cruel Daunger pleynly at the last, That with the dethe guerdonlesse he past. 58 Lo her the fyne of lover[e]s seruise! Lo how that Love can his seruantis quyte! Lo how he can his feythful men dispise, To sle the trwe men, and fals to respite! Lo how he doth the suerde of sorowe byte In hertis suche as must his lust obey, To save the fals and do the trwe dey! 59 For feythe nor othe, worde ne assuraunce, Trwe menyng, awayte, or besynesse, Stil[le] port ne feythful attendaunce, Manhode ne myght in armes worthinesse, Pursute of wurschip, nor [no] high provesse In straunge londe rydinge, ne trauayle, Ful lyte or noght in love dothe avayle. 60 Peril of dethe, nother in se ne londe Hungre ne thrust, sorowe ne sekenesse, Ne grete emprises for to take on honde, Shedyng of blode, ne manful hardynesse, Nor ofte woundynge at sawtes by distresse, Nor iupartyng of lyfe, nor dethe also: Al ys for noghte, Love taketh non hede therto. 61 But Lesynges with her fals flaterye, Thro her falshed and with her doublenesse, With tales new, and mony feyned lye, By False-Semlaunce, and Contrefet-Humblesse, Vnder colour depeynt with Stidfastnesse, With Fraude cured vnder a pitouse face, Accept ben now rathest vnto grace, 62 And can hem-self now best[e] magnifie With feyned port and presumpsion. They haunce her cause with fals Surquedrie, Vnder menyng of Double-Entencion, To thenken on in her opynyon And sey another, to set hym-selfe alofte, And hynder Tr[o]uthe, as hit ys seyn ful ofte. 63 The whiche thing I bye now al to dere, Thanked be Venus and the god Cupide! As hit is seen by myn oppressed chere, And by his arowes that stiken in my syde, That safe the dethe I no thing abide Fro day to day, alas, the harde while, When euere hys dart that hym list to fyle, 64 My woful hert[e] for to ryve atwo, For faute of mercye, and lake of pite Of her that causeth al my peyn and woo, And list not ones of grace for to see Vnto my trouthe throgh her cruelte. And most of al [?it] I me compleyn That she hath ioy to laughen at my peyn, 65 And wilfully hath my dethe [y] sworne, Al gilt[e]les and wote no cause why, Safe for the trouthe that I have hade aforne To her allone to serue feythfully. O God of Love! vnto the I crie, And to thy blende double deyte Of this grete wrong I compleyn[e] me, 66 And vnto thy stormy wilful variaunce, I-meynt with chaunge and gret vnstabl[en]esse, Now vp, now down, so rennyng is thy chaunce, That the to trust may be no sikernesse; I wite hit no-thinge but thi doublenesse. And who that is an archer, and ys blynde, Marketh nothing, but sheteth by wenynge; 67 And for that he hath no discrecion, With-oute avise he let his arowe goo, For lak of syght and also of resoun, In his shetyng hit happeth oft[e] soo, To hurt his frende rathir then his foo; So doth this god with his sharpe flon, The trwe sleeth and leteth the fals[e] gon. 68 And of his woundyng this is the worst of alle, When he hurteth he dothe so cruel wreche, And maketh the seke for to crie and calle Wnto his foo for to ben his leche, And hard hit ys for a man to seche, Vpon the poynt of dethe in [iu]-pardie, Vnto his foo to fynde remedye. 69 Thus fareth hit now euen[ly] by me, That to my foo that yaf my hert a wounde, Mot axe grace, mercie, and pite, And namely ther wher noon may be founde; For now my sore my leche wol confounde And god of kynde so hath set myn vre, My lyves foo to haue my wounde in cure. 70 Alas the while now that I was borne! Or that I euer saugh the bright[e] sonne! For now I see that ful longe aforne, Er I was borne, my destanye was sponne By Parcas sustren, to sle me if they conne, For they my dethe shopen or my shert, Oonly for trouthe I may hit not astert. 71 The myghty Goddesse also of Nature, That vnder God hath the gouernaunce Of worldly thinges commytted to her cure, Disposed hath thro her wyse purveaunce, To yive my lady so moche suffisaunce Of al vertues, and therwith-al purvyde To mordre Trouthe, hath taken Daunger to guyde. 72 For bounte, beaute, shappe, and semelyhed, Prudence, wite, passyngly fairenesse, Benigne port, glad chere with loulyhed, Of womanhed ryght plentevous largesse, Nature in her fully did empresse, Whan she her wroght, and altherlast Dysdeyne, To hinder Trouthe, she made her chambreleyne. 73 When Mystrust also, and Fals-suspecion, With Mys-Beleve she made for to be Chefe of counseyle to this conclusion, For to exile Routhe and eke Pite, Out of her court to make Mercie fle, So that Dispite now haldeth forth her reyn, Thro hasty beleve of tales that men feyn. 74 And thus I am for my trouthe, alas! Mordred and slayn with wordis sharp and kene, Gilt[e]les, God wote, of al trespas, And lye and blede vpon this colde grene. Now mercie, suete! mercye, my lyves quene! And to youre grace of mercie yet I prey, In your seruise that your man may dey. 75 But and so be that I shall deye algate, And that I shal non other mercye haue, Yet of my dethe let this be the date That by youre wille I was broght to my graue, Or hastely yf that ye list me saue My sharpe woundes that ake so and blede, Of mercie charme, and also of womanhede. 76 For other charme pleynly ys ther noon, But only mercie, to helpe[n] in this case; For thogh my wounde blede euere in oon, My lyve, my deth stondeth in your grace; And thogh my gilt be nothing, alace! I axe mercie in al my best entent, Redy to dye yf that ye assent. 77 For ther ayens shal I neuer strive In worde ne werke, pleynly I ne may, For leuer I haue then to be alyve To dye sothely, and hit be her to pay; Ye, thogh hit be this ech[e] same day, Or when that euer her lust to deuyse, Sufficeth me to dye in your seruise. 78 And God, that knowest the thoght of euery wyght Ryght as hit is, in euery thing thou maist se, Yet er I dye, with al my ful[le] myght, Louly I prey to graunte[n] vnto me That ye, goodly, feir[e], fressh, and fre, Which sle me oonly for defaut of routhe, Er then I die, [ye] may know my trouthe. 79 For that in sothe suffic[et]he [vnto] me, And she hit knowe in euery circumstaunce; And after I am wel[a]payed that she Yf that her lyst of deth to do vengeaunce Vnto me, that am vnder her legeaunce, Hit sitte me not her doom to dysobey, But at her lust wilfully to dey. 80 Wyth-out[e] gruching or rebellion, In wil or worde, holy I [me] assent, Or eny maner contradixion, Fully to be at her commaundement; And yf I dye, in my testament My hert I send, and my spirit also, What so-euer she list with hem to do. 81 And alderlast to her womanhede, And to her mercy me I recommaunde, That lye now here betwext hope and drede, Abyding pleynly what she list commaunde For vtterly—this nys no demaunde— Welcome to me while me lasteth brethe, Ryght at her cho[i]se, wher hit be lyf or dethe. 82 In this mater more what myght I seyn, Sithe in her honde and in her wille ys alle, Bothe lyf and dethe, my ioy, and al my peyn; And fynally my hest[e] holde I shall Til my spirit, be destanye fa[ta]l, When that her list, fro my body wynde; Haue her my trouthe and thus I make an ynde. 83 And with that worde he gan sike as sore, Lyke as his hert[e] ryve wolde atweyne, And holde his pese and spake a worde no more, But for to se his woo and mortal peyn; The teres gan[ne] fro myn eyen reyn Ful piteusly for werry inwarde routhe, That I hym sawe so languysshing for his trouthe. 84 And al this w[h]ile my-self I kep close Amonge the bowes, and my-self gunne hide, Til at the last the woful man arose, And to a logge went[e] ther be-syde, Wher al the May his custom was to abide, Sole to compleyn of his peynes kene, Fro yer to yer vnder the bowes grene. 85 And for be-cause that hit drowe to the nyght, And that the sunne his arke divrnall I-passed was, so that his persaunt lyght, His bryght[e] bemes, and his stremes all Were in the wawes of the water fall, Vnder the bordure of our occean, His chare of golde his course so swyftly ran; 86 And while the twilyght and the rowes rede Of Phebus lyght wer deaurat a-lyte: A penne I toke and gan me fast[e] spede, The woful pleynt of this man to write, Worde be worde, as he dyd endyte; Lyke as I herde, and coude him tho reporte, I haue here set, your hertis to dysporte. 87 Iff oght be mys, leyth the wite on me, For I am worthy for to bere the blame; Yf eny thing mys-reported be, To make this dite for to seme lame Thro myn vnkynnyng, but for to seme the same Lyke as this man his compleynt did expresse: I axe mercie and foryeuenesse. 88 And as I wrote me thoght I sawe aferre, Fer in the west lustely appere Esperus, the goodly bryght[e] sterre, So glad, so feire, so persaunt eke of chere, I mene Venus with her bemys clere, That heuy hertis oonly to releve Is wont of custom for to shew at eve. 89 And I as fast fel dovn on my kne, And euen thus to her I gan to preie: “O lady Venus! so feire vpon to se, Let not this man for his trouthe dey, For that ioy thou haddest when thou ley With Mars thi knyght, whom Vulcanus founde And with a cheyne vnvisible yow bounde, 90 “To-gedre both tweyne in the same while, That al the court above celestial, At youre shame gan [to] laughe and smyle. O feire lady! wel-willy founde at al, Comfort to carefull! O goddesse immortal! Be helpyng now, and do thy diligence, To let the stremes of thin influence 91 “Descende dovne, in furtheryng of the trouthe, Namely of hem that lye in sorow bounde; Shew now thy myght, and on her wo haue routhe Er fals Daunger sle hem and confounde: And specialy let thy myght be founde For to socour, what so that thou may, The trew[e] man, that in the erber lay; 92 “And al[le] trew[e] further for his sake, O glad[e] sterre! O lady Venus myn! And [cause] his lady him to grace take; Her hert of stele to mercy so enclyne, Er that thy bemes go vp to declyne, And er that thou now go fro vs adovne, For that love thou haddest to Adon.” 93 And when [that] she was goon [vn]to her rest I rose anon, and home to bed[de] went For werry wery, me thoght hit for the best; Preyng thus in al my best entent, That al[le] trew[e], that be with daunger shent, With mercie may, in reles of her peyn, Recured be, er May come eft aye[y]n. 94 Andfor that I ne may noo lenger wake, Farewel, ye louers al[le] that be trewe! Prayng to God, and thus my leve I take, That er the sunne to morowe be ryse newe, And er he haue ayen his rosen hewe, That eche of yow may haue such a grace, His ovne lady in armes to embrace. 95 I mene thus, that in al honeste, With-oute more ye may to-gedre speke What-so yow list at good liberte, That eche may to other her hert[e] breke, On Ielosie oonly to be wreke, That hath so longe of his malice and envie Werred Trouthe with his tiranye. Lenvoye. Princes, pleseth hit your benignite This litil dite [for] to haue in mynde, Of womanhede also for to se, Your trew[e] man may summe mercie fynde And pite eke, that longe hath [be] be-hynde, Let [him] ayein be prouoked to grace; For by my trouthe hit is ayen[e]s kynde, Fals Daunger to occupie his place. Lenvoye de quare. Go, litel quayre, go vn-to my lyves quene, And my verry hertis souereigne, And be ryght glad for she shal the sene; Such is thi grace, but I, alas, in peyne Am left behinde, and not to whom to pleyn; For Mercie, Routhe, Grace, and eke Pite Exiled be, that I may not ateyne, Recure to fynde of myn adversite. 4. THE FLOURE OF CURTESY. [From Thynne's Chaucer, 1532, leaves 283–284, back.] 1 In Feuerier, whan the frosty moone, Was horned ful of Phebus firy lyght, And that she gan to reyse her streames sone, Saynt Valentyne, vpon thy blisful nyght Of dewetee, whan glad is euery wight, And foules chese, to voyde her olde sorowe, Eueryche his make, vpon the next[e] morowe; 2 The same tyme, I herde a larke synge Ful lustely, agayne the morowe gray: “Awake, ye louers, out of your slombringe, This glad[e] morowe, in al the haste ye may; Some obseruaunce dothe vnto this day, Your choyse ayen of herte to renewe, In confyrmyng for euer to be trewe. 3 “And ye that be, of chosyng, at your large This lusty day, by custome of nature, Take vpon you the blisful holy charge To serue Loue, whyle your lyfe may dure, With herte, body, and al your besy cure, For euermore, as Venus and Cipride For you disposeth, and the god Cupyde. 4 “For ioye owe we playnly to obey[e] Vnto this lordes mighty ordynaunce, And, mercylesse, rather for to d[e]ye Than euer in you be founden varyaunce, And, though your lyfe be medled with greuaunce, And at your herte closed be your wounde, Beth alway one, there as ye are bounde.” 5 That whan I had herde, and lysted longe, With deuoute herte, the lusty melodye Of this heuenly comfortable songe, So agreable as by ermonye, I rose anon, and faste gan me hye Towarde a groue, and the way [to] take, Foules to sene eueryche chose his make. 6 And yet I was ful thursty in languisshyng; Myn ague was so feruent in his hete Whan Aurora, for drery complaynyng, Can distyl her chrystal teeres wete Vpon the soyle, with syluer dewe so swete, For she durste, for shame, not apere Vnder the lyght of Phebus beames clere. 7 And so, for anguysshe of my paynes kene, And for constraynte of my sighes sore, I set me downe vnder a laurer grene Ful pitously; and alway more and more, As I behelde into the holtes hore, I gan complayne myn inwarde deedly smerte, That aye so sore craunpisshed myn herte. 8 And whyle that I, in my drery payne Sate and behelde aboute on euery tre The foules sytte, alway twayne and twayne, Than thought I thus, “Alas, what may this be, That euery foule hath his lyberte Frely to chose after his desyre Eueryche his make thus, fro yere to yere? 9 “The sely wrenne, the tytemose also, The lytel redbrest, haue free election To flyen yfere and togyther go Where as hem lyst, aboute enuyron, As they of kynde haue inclynacion, And as Nature, emp[e]resse and gyde, Of euery thyng lyst[e] to prouyde. 10 “But man alone, alas, the harde stounde, Ful cruelly, by kyndes ordynaunce, Constrayned is, and by statute bounde, And debarred from al suche plesaunce What meneth this? What is this purueyaunce Of God aboue, agayne al right of kynde, Without[e] cause, so narowe man to bynde?” 11 Thus may I se[y]ne, and playne[n] [eke], alas! My woful houre and my disauenture, That doulfully stonde in the same caas, So ferre behynde, from al helth and cure. My wounde abydeth lyke a sursanure, For me Fortune so felly lyste dispose, My harme is hyd, that I dare not disclose. 12 For I my herte haue set in suche a place Wher I am neuer lykely for to spede, So ferre I am hyndred from her grace That saue Daunger I haue none other mede; And thus, alas! I not who shal me rede Ne for myne helpe shape remedye, For Male-bouche, and for false Enuye; 13 The whiche twayne aye stondeth in my wey Malyciously, and false Suspection Is very cause also that I dey, Gynnyng and rote of my distruction, So that I fele, in conclusyon, With her traynes that they wol me shende, Of my labour that dethe mote make an ende. 14 Yet, or I dye, with herte, wyl, and thought To God of Loue this auowe I make: As I best can, howe dere that it be bought, Where so it be that I slepe or wake, Whyle Boreas dothe the leaues shake, As I haue heyght, plainly, tyl I sterue, For wel or wo, that I shal her serue. 15 And for her sake nowe this holy tyme, Saynt Valentyne! somwhat shal I write, Al-though so be that I can not ryme, Nor curyously by no crafte endyte, Yet leuer I haue that she put the wyte In vnconnyng than in neglygence, Whateuer I saye of her excellence. 16 Whateuer I say, it is of du[we]te, In sothfastnesse, and no presumpcion; This I ensure to you that shal it se, That it is al vnder correction, What I reherce in commendacion Of her, that I shal to you, as blyue, So, as I can, her vertues here discryue. 17 Ryght by example as the somer sonne Passeth the sterre with his beames shene, And Lucyfer amonge the skyes donne A-morowe sheweth, to voyde nyghtes tene, So, verily, withouten any wene, My lady passeth, who-so taketh hede, Al tho alyue to speke of womanhede. 18 And as the ruby hath the soueraynte Of ryche stones and the regalye, And the rose of swetenesse and beaute, Of fresshe floures, without[en] any lye, Ryght so, in sothe, with her goodly eye, She passeth al in bountie and fayrenesse, Of maner eke, and of gentylnesse. 19 For she is bothe the fayrest and the beste, To reken al in very sothfastnesse; For euery vertue is in her at reste, And furthermore, to speke of stedfastnesse, She is the rote, and of semelynesse The very myrrour, and of gouernaunce To al example, withouten varyaunce. 20 Of porte benygne, and wonder glad of chere, Hauyng euermore her trewe aduertence Alway to reason; so that her desyre Is brideled aye by wytte and prouydence. Thereto of wytte and of hye prudence She is the welle, aye deuoyde of pride, That vnto vertue her-seluen is the gyde. 21 And ouer this in her dalyaunce Lowly she is, discrete and wyse [and fre], And goodly glad by attemperaunce, That euery wight of hygh and lowe degre Are glad in herte with her for to be; So that, shortly, if I shal not lye, She named is “The Floure of Curtesye.” 22 And there to speke of femynyte, The leste mannysshe in comparyson, Goodly abasshed, hauyng aye pyte Of hem that ben in trybulacion, For she alone is consolacion To al that arne in mischefe and in nede, To comforte hem of her womanhede. 23 And aye in vertue is her besy charge, Sadde and demure, and but of wordes fewe, Dredeful also of tonges that ben large, Eschewyng aye hem that lyste to hewe Aboue her heed, her wordes for to shewe, Dishonestly to speke of any wight; She deedly hateth of hem to haue a syght. 24 The herte of whom so honest is and clene, And her entent so faythful and entere That she ne may, for al the worlde, sustene To suffre her eeres any worde to here Of frende nor foe neyther ferre ne nere Amysse resowning, þat hynder shulde his name, And if she do, she wexeth reed for shame. 25 So trewly in menyng she is in-sette, Without chaungyng or any doublenesse; For bountie and beautie are togyther knette On her persone vnder faythfulnesse; For voyde she is of newfanglenesse, In herte aye one, for euer to perseuer There she is sette, and neuer to disseuer. 26 I am to rude her vertues euerychone Cunnyngly to discryue and write, For, wel ye wot, colour haue I none Lyke her discrecion craftely to endyte, For what I say, al it is to lyte; Wherfore to you thus I me excuse, That I aqueynted am not with no muse. 27 By rethorike my style to gouerne In her preise and commendacion, I am to blynde so hylye to discerne Of her goodnesse to make discrypcion, Saue thus I say, in conclusyon, If that I shal shortly [her] commende, In her is naught that Nature can amende. 28 For good she is, lyke to Polycene, And in fayrenesse to the quene Helayne, Stedfast of herte as was Dorigene And wyfely trouthe, if I shal not fayne, In constaunce eke and faythe, she may attayne To Cleopatre, and therto as secree As was of Troye the whyte Antygone. 29 As Hester meke, lyke Judith of prudence Kynde as Alcest or Marcia Catoun, And to Grisylde lyke in pacience, And Ariadne of discrecioun, And to Lucrece, that was of Rome toun, She may be lykened, as for honeste, And for her faythe, vnto Penelope. 30 To fayre Phyllis and to Hipsyphilee For innocence and for womanhede, For semelynesse vnto Canace; And ouer this, to speke of goodlyhede, She passeth al that I can of rede, For worde and dede, that she naught ne fal, Acorde in vertue, and her werkes al. 31 For though that Dydo with wytte sage Was in her tyme stedfast to Enee, Of hastynesse yet she dyd outrage, And so for Iason dyd also Medee; But my lady is so auysee That, bountie and beautie bothe in her demeyne, She maketh bountie alway souerayne. 32 This is to meane, bountie gothe afore, Lad by prudence, and hath the soueraynte, And beautie foloweth, ruled by her lore, That she ne fende her in no degre; So that, in one, this goodly fresshe fre Surmountyng al, withouten any were, Is good and fayre in one persone yfere. 33 And though that I, for very ignoraunce, Ne may discryue her vertues by and by, Yet on this day, for a remembraunce, Onely supported vnder her mercy, With quakyng honde, I shal ful humbly To her hynesse, my rudenesse for to quyte, A lytel balade here byneth endyte. 34 Euer as I can supprise in myn herte, Alway with feare, betwyxt drede and shame, Leste out of lose any worde asterte In this metre to make it seme lame; Chaucer is deed, that had suche a name Of fayre makyng, that, without[en] wene, Fayrest in our tonge, as the laurer grene. 35 We may assay for to countrefete His gay[e] style, but it wyl not be; The welle is drie, with the lycoure swete, Bothe of Clye and of Caliope; And, first of al, I wol excuse me To her that is grounde of goodlyhede, And thus I say vntyl her womanhede:— Balade Symple 36 “With al my might and [in] my best entent, With al the faythe that mighty God of kynde Me yaue, syth he me soule and knowyng sent, I chese, and to this bonde euer I me bynde, To loue you best, whyle I haue lyfe and mynde.” Thus herde I foules, in the dawenyng, Vpon the day of Saynte Valentyne synge. 37 “Yet chese I, at the begynnyng, in this entent, To loue you, though I no mercy fynde, And if you lyste I dyed, I wolde assent, As euer twynne I quicke out of this lyn[d]e. Suffyseth me to sene your fethers ynde.” Thus herde I foules in the mor[we]nynge Vpon the daye of Saynte Valentyne synge. 38 “And ouer this, myne hertes luste to bente, In honour onely of the wodde-bynde, Holy I yeue, neuer to repente In ioye or wo, where-so that I wynde To fore Cupyde, with his eyen blynde.” The foules al, whan Tytan dyd springe, With deuoute hert, me thought I herde synge. Lenuoye Princesse of beautie, to you I represent This symple dyte, rude as in makynge, Of herte and wyl faythful in myn entent, Lyke as this day foules herde I synge. Here endeth the Floure of Curtesy 5. A GENTLEWOMAN'S LAMENT. [MS. Trin. Coll. Camb. R. 3. 20, pp. 152–154.] And here begynneþe a balade sayde by a gentilwomman whiche loued a man of gret estate. 1 Allas! I wooful creature, Lyving betweene hope and dreed, Howe might I þe woo endure, In tendrenesse of wommanhede, In langoure ay my lyff to leede, And sette myn hert in suche a place, Wher as I, be liklyhede, Am euer vnlyke to stonde in grace! 2 Þer is so gret a difference Tweene his manheed and my symplesse, Þat Daunger by gret vyolence Haþe me brought in gret distresse; And yit in verray sikurnesse, Þoughe my desyre I neuer atteyne, Yit withoute doublenesse To love him best I shal not feyne. 3 For whane we were ful tendre of yeeris, Flouring booþe in oure chyldheed, Wee sette to nothing oure desyres, Sauf vn-to playe, and tooke noon heede, And gaderd flowres in þe meede, Of youþe þis was oure moost plesaunce, And Love þoo gaf me for my meede A knotte in hert of remembraunce, 4 Which þat neuer may beo vnbounde, Hit is so stedfast and so truwe, For alwey oone I wol beo founde His womman, and chaunge for no nuwe! Wolde God þe sooþe þat he knewe, Howe offt I sighe for his saake, And he me list not onys ruwe, Ne yyveþe no force, what yvell I make. 5 His poorte, his cheere, and his fygure Beon euer present in my sight, In whos absence eeke I ensure, I cane neuer be gladde ne light: Fore he is my chosen knyght, Þaughe hit to him ne beo not kouþe, And so haþe he beon boþe day and night, Truly fro my tendre youþe. 6 Emprynted in myn inwarde thought, And alwey shal til þat I deye, Out of myn hert he parteþe nought, Ne neuer shal, I dare weel seye. His loue so soore me dooþe werreye, God graunt hit tourne for þe best! For I shal neuer, I dare wel sey, Withoute his love lyve in rest. 7 A trouthe in tendre aage gonne, Of loue with longe perseueraunce, In my persone so sore is ronne, Þat þer may beo no varyaunce; For al myn hertes souffysaunce Is, wheþer þat I waake or wynk, To haue hooly my remembraunce On his persone, so mychil I thynk! 6. MY LADY DERE. [MS. B.M.

For nowe vpon þis first day I wil my choys renuwe, All þe whyles þat I lyve to hir to be truwe, Boþe to serue and love hir best with al myn hert entier. 2 For I haue maked myn avowe, in verray sothefastnesse, To beo hir faythful truwe man, withoute doublenesse, Wher so euer þat I be ouþer fer or ner. 3 Hit voydeþe al myn hevynesse, boþe in thought and ded, Whane þat I remembre me vpon hir goodelyhed, Because she is so wommanly, boþe of port and chere. 4 And as I stoode myself alloone, vpon þe Nuwe Yere night, I prayed vnto þe frosty moone, with hir pale light, To go and recomaunde me vnto my lady dere. 5 And erly on þe nexst morowe, kneling in my cloos, I prayed eke þe shene sonne, þe houre whane he aroos, To gon also and sey þe same in his bemys clere. 6 But þo þer came a clowdy thought, and gan myn hert assayle, And sayde me, howe my servyce þer me shoulde not avayle, Til my lady mercylesse me hade brought on beer. 7 Hit is ful hard to grave in steel and in a flynt al-so, And yit men may smyte fyre of hem boþe two, But I may of hir hert of steel mercye noon requere. 8 Þo came gode hope ageyne and gan myn hert adawe, And of myn hevy stormy thought apeese wel þe wawe, And so þe skyes of dispeyre began to wexen clere. 9 And yit ageyne for hevynesse I gane me to compleyne, Þat she was so fer away, myn hertes soueraine, Which to spek of wommanhed haþe in þis world no peer. 10 And whanne I thenke verrayly vpon hir wommanhed, And þer withal recorde also hir hevenly godelyhed, I seo sheo is so fer fro me, allas, and I am here. 11 For sheo passeþe of beaute Isaude and Eleyne, I sey in soþe as thenkeþe me, for me list not feyne, And yonge fresshe Polixene with hir eyen cler. 12 She passeþe eke of desport Dydo of Cartage, Adrean and Medea by fauour of vysage, And eke alle þoo þat euer I sawe in any coost appere. 13 Penalapee was in hir tyme moost famous of fayrnesse, And Ester was ecalled eke myrour of gentylesse, But yit noon of hem euerychoon is lyke my lady dere. 14 Iff I shal reherce also Gresyldes pacyence, My lady haþe, I dare wel sey, more passing eloquence To reherse by and by hir vertus alle efeere. 15 I hade leuer a looke alloone withoute[n] any more Of hir goodely eyen twoo myn haromes to restore, Þanne haue alle oþer at my wille I rechche not who hit here. 16 I haue no thing to gyven hir at þis gladde tyme, But myn hert vndeparted, nowe þis first[e] pryme, Þe which þis day I sende hir al hooly and entier. 17 And þis lytel symple gifft I prey hir nought refuse, Þe whiche þoughe hit but symple beo, but God wil me excuse, For yif she toke hit not aright, I shulde hit bye to dere. 18 Who gyvethe his hert he graunteþe al his good[es] in substance, And vn-to hir I gif hit al withoute repentaunce, And þat I am hir truwest man þer by she may hit lere. 19 Now go forthe, hert, and be right glad with hir to abyde, And wayt vpon hir day or night, wher þat she go or ryde, And looke þow part not away, I charge, in no maner. 20 And þoughe þou soiourne euer þer hit shal not cost[e] gret For constreynt of þe wyntur colde ner sunne with his het, For despense of þe vitayle shal nought beo to deer. 21 Go nowe forþe, þou lytel songe, vpon my message, And sey howe þat I gyve hir hole with þe surplusage, Hert, body, and al my good, and my servyce in fere. 22 Lat no wawes ner no wynde lettyn þy passage, Ne stormes of þe salt[e] see, ne no rokkes rage; Þe streemes of hir hevenly looke shul alle þy sorowes steer. 23 Go forthe in hast, þou lytel songe, and no lenger tarye, Now vpon þe first day of þis Ianuarye, And conferme fully vp my choyse ay frome yere to yere.

For cruwel Daunger was my guyde Withoute mercy oþer grace, And so for me can ay provyde, I was forsake in euery place. 2 And wher I put me most in prees, Þer was I firþest esett abacke. Disdeyne enseled my releesse, And wrot þe quytaunce al with black, So þat vpon me fel al þe wrack Of hem þat list at loue chace; Þer was of mercy so gret lacke I was forsake in euery place. 3 I koude neuer go to-forne In no servyce my-self tavaunce; I blewe alwey þe bukkes horne, So vnhappy was my chaunce; And ay þe fyne of my plesaunce, And cheef also of my pourchace, Was to begynne a newe daunce To be forsake in euery place. 4 Yif I loued in hye estate, Þer fonde I nought but disdeyne; And lower dovne I fonde debate, And þus I served euer in veyne; Of hope þer was no dewe ne reyne In no degre me to solace; For which I may of trouthe seyne I am forsake in euery place. 5 I loued some þat wer right feyre, Þat tooke of me no maner heed; And some right fresshe and debonayre, Þat gaf me daunger for my mede; And some eke for hir wommanhed, And some for hir goodely face; Þat my fortune doþe me lede To be forsaken in euery place. 6 And þer as I loued for richchesse Pouert plonged me a-dovne; And wher I did moost bisynesse Skorne was my conclusyoun And for my truwe affeccioun A deynous looke gan me manace; Þat I may wryte for my resoun I am forsake in euery place. 7 I loued some fer ronne in age, Al þoughe hit wer ful truwe chaffare; And yonge eke ful wylde and rage, And list not for no coste to spare; And þus I pleyde Iacke þe Haare, And gane to hoppe a newe trace, And sange “Go, farewell feldfare,” As man forsake in euery place. 8 Þer fonde I moost confusyoun Þer as I did moost my cure; And moost hade indignacioun Wher as lengest I did endure; And my woful aventure Disdayne and Daunger did enbrace; Þat I may singe þe Chaunteplure As man forsake in euery place. LENVOYE. To alle wymmen þis compleynt With cursed hert I nowe direct, Whos corage is euer emeynt With doubulnesse, suche is þe sect, Which soþely no man may correct, Youre nature haþe so double a face, Whos galle ay newe doþe infect Þe sugre of men in euery place.

BEWARE OF DOUBLENESSE. [From MS. Bodley Fairfax 16, leaves 199 to 199, back]. 1 This worlde is ful of variaunce In euery thing, whoo taketh hede, That feyth and trust and al constaunce Exiled ben, this is noo drede; And, safe oonly in womanhede, I kan see no sykyrnesse; But for al that, yet as I rede, Be-ware alwey of doublenesse. 2 Also these fresh somer floures, White and rede, blewe and grene, Ben sodeynly with wynter shoures Made feynt and fade with-oute wene; That truste is noon, as ye may sene, In no thinge, nor noo stedfastnesse; Except in women, thus I mene, Yet ay be-ware of doublenesse. 3 The croked moone—this is no tale— Som while is shene and bryght of hewe; And after that ful derke and pale, And euery monyth chaungeth newe; That, who-so the verray sothe knewe, Alle thynge is bilte on brotilnesse,— Save that women ay be trewe, Yet ay be-war of doublenesse. 4 The lusty fressh[e] somers day And Phebus, with his bemes clere, Towardes nyght they drawe away And no lenger lyste appere; So in this present lyfe now here, Noo-thinge abytte in hys fairenesse, Save women ay be founde entere And devoide of doublenesse. 5 The see eke, with his sterne wawes, Eche day floweth new ageyn, And by concourse of his lawes The ebbe foloweth, in certeyn; After grete drought ther cometh a reyne, That fare-wel alle her stablenesse,— Save that women be hool and pleyne; Yet ay be-war of doublenesse. 6 Fortunes whele gooth rounde about A thousande tymes, day and nyght, Whos course stondeth euer in doute, For to transmewe, she ys so lyght; For which aduertyth in your syght The vntrust of worldly fikelnesse,— Saue women which, of kyndely ryght, Ne haue no tachche of doublenesse. 7 What man may the wynde restreyne, Or holde a snake by the tayle, Or a slepur eele constreyne That yt wil voyde, withoute fayle? Or whoo kan dryve so a nayle To make sure new fanglenesse,— Save women that kan guye her sayle To rowe her boote with doublenesse? 8 Atte euery haven they kan arryve Where as they woote ys good passage. Of innocence they kan not strive Wyth wawes, nor noo rokkes rage; So happe ys her lodmanage Wyth nelde and stoon her course to dresse, That Salamon was not so sage To fynde in hem noo doublenesse. 9 Wher-fore, who-so hem accuse Of any double entencion, To speke rovne, outher to muse, To pynche at hyr condicion— Alle is but fals collusion, I dar ryght welle the sothe expresse: They haue no bette proteccion But shrowde hem vnder doublenesse. 10 So wel ffortuned ys hir chaunce The dise to turne vp so don, With sis and synke they kan avaunce And than by revolucion They sette a felle conclusion Of ambesase, in sothfastnesse, Though clerkes make mencion Ther kynde ys frete with doublenesse. 11 Sampson hadde experience That women weren ful trew[e] founde Whan Dalida of innocence With sheres gan his hede to rounde; To speke also of Rosamounde, And Cleopatris feythfulnesse, The storyes pleynly wil confounde Men that apeche her doublenesse. 12 Sengle thing ne is nat preysed, Nor oo folde is of noo renovne, In balaunce whan they be peysed For lakke of weght they be bore dovne; And for this cause of iuste resovne These women alle, of ryghtwysnesse, Of choys and free eleccion, Muste love eschaunge and doublenesse. Lenvoy. O ye women whiche ben enclyned, By influence of youre nature, To ben as pure as golde y-fyned, In your trouthe for to endure, Arme your-selfe in stronge armure, Leste men assayle youre sikernesse; Sette on your brest, your-self tassure, A myghty shelde of doublenesse.

Digby 181, leaves 8, back, to 10.] 1 T]o Adam and Eve Crist gave the soueraig[n]te Of Paradice, and domynacion, A place fullfilled of all ffelicite, The ffrutes all in there subieccion, Save that of oon was made excepcion, Which God forbade, the Bible canne devise, They sholde it touche in no maner wyse. 2 Which vertu hadde agayn all maladie, Folk to preferre in youth in ther ffresshnes; Who ate þerof sholde neuer die, But leve ever in ioy and gladnes, And nothir ffele trouble nor sikenes But in that place haue ever hertis ease And sufficiant of all that myght hem please, 3 Ever indure, and neuer ffall in age, For which it was called the tre of lyff. But whan Adam was ffallen in dotage, And agayn God beganne to holden stryff, Through excityng of Eve, þat was his wyff, And wilfully gave to here assent Goddes preceptis to breke, and commaundment, 4 They were banysshed out of that blisfull lyf— Whan Adam gafe credence to a snake, And wrecchidly gaue trust vnto his wyff, Which did the apple of the serpent take, And plesauntly did a present make Vnto Adam, as she ffirst bygan Deth to devise and poyson to man. 5 To Salamon also, Kynge of Israell, Sonne of Dauid, Crist gave in commaundment With straungers in no wise that he sholde mell; And for he not liste sue Cristis intent, But to straunge women gave wilfully his assent, Ther goddes worshippid, the Bible ye may see, And folowed his own wyll, and sensualite, 6 Crist wolde hym chast[i]e, in this maner wise: Gave his kyngdom, aftir his mortall fate, To Ieroboan his seruant, the Bible doth deuyse, Disheretyng his heires from house and estate. Who doth aftir women erly or late Accomplyssh ther willes &amp; desires euermore, Grete wonder is at laste, but he repent sore. 7 Also Iacob his wyff, called Rachell, Her own faþer Laban mokked &amp; disceyued; Stale his goodes, the story doth it tell; Leyde hem on the grownde, þe trouth well conceyved, And fforthwith anoon, or it was perceyued, Sate vpon them, these goodes for to hyde, Disceyvyng her ffaþer with surquedry and pride. 8 Holyfernus also, leder of the oste Of Nebugodonoser, the grete warrioure, Of all women loued Iudith most, Trustyng to haue had her to his paramour; But he, wyne-dronken, to slepe lay in his boure With his own swerde, was it not [a] wonder, Att two strokes she smote his nek a-sondir. 9 And Iob in ricches all othir did excell Of his contre, suche was þat tyme his grace, And noon so poure, thus doth the story tell, Was not alyve, borne as he was; But was it not pite, in his most wrecchid caas, In his most povert and moste myserie, His wyf hym rebuked &amp; on a donghyll left hym lye? 10 Sampson also, the strengest man of myght That ever was, loved Dalida the ffeyre, On whom his hert was sett, both day &amp; nyght, She cowde here ffayne so meke and so debonayre, Make hym suche chere whan hym list repaire; But I may call here “Dalida the double,” Cheff cause and rote of his mortall trouble. 11 For he ment trouth, and she was variable; He was ffeithfull, and she was vntrewe; He was stedfast, and she [was] vnstable; He trustith euer oon, she loved thynges newe; She wered colours of many diuers hewe, In stede of blewe, which is stedfast &amp; clene, She loved chaungis of many dyvers grene. 12 But to the purpose for to condiscende, Whan she of Sampson knewe the prevyte, Here ffalshode shortly for to comprehende, She made hym slepe full softly on hir kne, And a sharp rasour aftir toke she Shove of his here, large &amp; of grete lengthe; Wherby, allas, he lost all his strengthe. 13 Thus Sampson was by Dalida deceyved, She cowde so well fflatter, fforge, &amp; ffeyne; Which whan þe Philistens haue conceyued, Vnwarly bounde hym in a myghty cheyne, Cast hym in preson, put out his eyen tweyne, And of despite after, as I fynde, Att þer quernys made hym [for] to grynde. 14 Damage in erth is noon so greuous As an enmy which is secre; Nor pestilens noon so perilous As falsnes, wher it is preve, And specially in ffemynyte, For wher women woll flitte &amp; be variable, Shall no man make hem stedfast &amp; stable. 15 Thise olde ensamples ought i-nowgh suffice Men to be ware, though ther were no newe; But who-so listeth not by othir hym-silf chastice, Othir woll by hym, whan he shall it rewe. Some women outrage, some stedfast been &amp; true; Some renne in riote, of custome this is no faile, Suche woll disceyue, there nature is so frayle. Explicit. 14. A BALLADE OF JAK HARE. [From MS.

Wassail to Maymond and to his Iousy pate, Vnthryfft and he be to-gedre met; Late at eve he wol onspere the gate, And grope on morwe yif Riggis bak be wet, And yif the bak of To-gace be out het; His heuy nolle at mydmorwe vplyfftyng, With on-wasshen handis, not lased his doublet, Out of a bolle to plukke out the lynyng.

For cast of eggys wil not oonys spare, Tyl he be quaylled, body, bak, and syde; His heed endooryd, and of verray pryde.

Laud Misc. 683, leaves 56 to 60.] Here begynneth a tale of thre skore ffoolys and thre wich ar lyk neuer ffor to the. 1 The ordre of foolis, ful yore agoon be-gonne, Neuly professed encreseth the kovent. Bachus and Iuno haue set a-broche a tonne And brouht þe braynes on-to the exegent. Markolff, ther foundour, patroun, &amp; president, Noumbre of this frary told iij skore and thre; Echon registred, be greet avysement; Endosed ther patent, that they shal neuer the. 2 Cheef of alle folys, men in bokys redeth, Able in his foly to holde resydence, Is he that nouther loveth God nor dredith, Nor to his chirche hath noon advertence, Nor to his seyntys doth no reuerence, And hath dysdeyn of ffolk in poverte, To ffader, moder doth no benyvolence— A-seele his patent, for he shal neuer the. 3 The sixte ffooll this frary to be-gynne, More than a fooll, braynles, maad, and wood, Is he that neuer wyll forsake his synne; Nor he that can nouht, nor lerne wil no good; And he that hath two facys in on hood, May ben enrollid in this ffraternyte; Cherl of condicioun and born of gentyll blood May cleyme of riht that he shal neuer the. 4 The tenthe fooll may hoppe vpon the ryng, Foote al afforn, and lede of riht the daunce, He that al yeveth, and kepeth hym-self nothyng. A double herte, fair ffeyned contenaunce; A pretens face, treble in his dalyaunce; Tonge spreynt with sugre, þe galle kept secre, A perlous mouth is wers than spere or launce, Thogh they be cherisshed, God let hem neuer the. 5 Off this fraternyte there is mo than oon Prouerbe seyd in old language: Tendre broweys skalt with a mary-boon, For feble stomakys is holsom in potage; The mary is good, the boon doth but damage. In symulacyoun ys ffals duplycyte, Who leveth the mary braideth on dotage, And cheseth the boon, God let hym neuer the. 6 A fface vnstable, gasyng Est and South, With loude lauhtres entrith his language, Gapeth as a rook, abrood goth iowe and mouth, Lyk a iay enfomyned in hys cage, Malapert of cheer and off vysage, Cometh to counsail or he callyd be, Of ech thyng medlith, his thrifft lith in morgage, Devaunt a knave that schall neuer the. 7 In the book of prudent Cypryan Wich callid is ‘a gardeyn of his fflours,’ He seith a pulteer that selleth a fat swan For a goselyng that greseth on bareyn clours; And he that casteth his cloke a wey in shours, Out of the tempest whan he may ffle; Or whan that Sperado loveth paramours— On of the nombre that schall neuer the. 8 And he also that halt hym-selff wys, Wich in werkyng hath noon experience, Whos chaunce goth nouther on synk nor sis, With ambes—as encreseth his dyspence; A foltyssh face, rude of elloquence, Bosteth with bordas, and at a bront wil ffle; Tween wolle &amp; gossomer is a gret difference, Stuff for a chapman that is nat lyk to the. 9 I redde also of other ffoolys twoo: Thyng to chalenge to wich he hath no right, And he in trouthe is a more ffooll also, Wich al requereth that cometh in his sight. And he is a ffooll wich on-to euery wight Telleth his counsaill and his preuytee. Who sekith werre and hath hym-selff no myht, It were gret mervail that euer he sholde the. 10 Another fool with counterfeet vysage Is he that can falsly ffage and ffeyne, Where that he be old or yong of age, Seith he is syk, and felt no maner peyne; And he that doth his owne wyf dysdeyne, And halt a-nother, of what estat she bee— With other foolys enbrace hym in þe cheyne, A warantyse that he schall neuer the. 11 Off this ffrary mo ffoolys to expresse: He that is to euery man contrarye, And he that bosteth of his cursidnesse, And he also that doth prolonge and tarye, With fair hestis, from his promys to varye— Breeffly to telle, I can noon other see—; He lyk a ffugytyff, that ffleeth to seyntwarie For dred of hangyng, for he schal neuer the. 12 He is a ffooll eek, as Senek seyth, That longe delaieth his purpos for to speede; A gretter ffooll he that breketh his ffeith; And he is a ffooll that doth no shame drede; And he that hoteth, &amp; faileth his frend at nede, Whos promys braideth on duplycyte; An hardy mous, that is bold to brede In cattys eris, that brood shal neuer the. 13 And he is a ffooll that also yeveth credence To newe rumours and euery foltyssh ffable; A dronklew fool that spareth for no dispence, To drynke a taunt, tyl he slombre at þe table; Among alle foolys that fool is most coupable That is a-cursed, and hath ther-of deynte; A pore beggere for to be vengable, Purs Penylees in plees may neuer the. 14 And he that holdeth a quarel ageyn right, Halt his purpos stiborne ageyn resoun; And he is a fooll, that is ay glad to ffyght, And to debate seketh occasioun, Abit so longe tyl he be bete doun, Dronke, lame, that he may nat ffle; And who reioissheth to soioure in prisoun, Enrolle hym vp, for he schall neuer the. 15 A lusty galaunt that weddit an old wicche, For gret tresour, because his purs is bare; An hungry huntere þat handeth hym a bicche, Nemel of mouth, for to mordre an hare; Nyht riotours that wil no wareyn spare, With-oute licence or ony lyberte, Tyl sodeyn perel brynge hem in þe snare, A ppreperatyf that they shal neuer the. 16 Who doth amys &amp; lauheth hym-self to scorne; Or come to counsail or that he be callyd; Or loude lawheth whan he sholde morne, Among alle folis of riht he may be stallyd; Purposeth his viage whan his hors is gallid; Plukketh of his schoon toward his iourne; Forsaketh fressh wyn, &amp; drynkith ale appalid— Swich foltyssh tast, God let hem neuer the. 17 And he þat is a ryotour all his lyff, And hath his felawe &amp; neihebour in despiht, And woundeth hym-self with his owne knyf, Of o candel he weneth two were lyght, Slepeth a day, and waccheth al the nyght, Alle massis doon longe or he redy bee, Suych on may cleyme be very title of riht, To been a brother of them shal neuer the. 18 Who halt al his þe tresour þat he wissheth, And gadreth gossomer to pakke it for wolle; And he is a fool affore þe net that ffissheth; And he is a ffool þat doth þe ffetherys pulle Of ffatte capouns, vp mewed to the ffulle, And hath no thyng but bonys for his ffee— Nullatensis aselyd hath a bulle To alle suych, that noon of hem schall the. 19 Whan þe gandre greseth on the grene, The sleyhty ffox doth hir brood be-holde. He taketh þe ffatte, casteth awey the lene; And Isigrinus, cheef wardeyn of the ffolde, Takith to his larder at what pris they be sold, Grettest lambre, oon, or two, or thre; In wynter nyhtes þe frostis been so colde, The shepperde slepeth—God let hym neuer the. 20 A foreyn lyknesse wich shal no mon displese, By a straunge vnkouth comparysoun: Whan þe belle-weder pastureth at his ese, Though al þe flok haue but smal ffoysoun, Slepeth at leiser, maketh noyse non, nor soun, Careth for no more so he haue plente— Alle tho that make suych a departysioun, Among her sogettys, God let hem neuer the. 21 With ful wombe they preche of abstynence, Ther botel fild with fressh wyn or good ale, Love weell rownyng, loutyng, and reuerence, Newe fals report with many glosyng tale, The iay more cherisshed than the nyhtyngale; Tabourerys with ther duplycyte, Plese more this daies whan stuffed is ther male, Farsed with fflateryng—God let hem neuer the. 22 To gete this ffrary a confirmacyoun Of somme vnthryffty bysshop Nullatense, And graunteth hem a generall pardoun, With a patent to begge ther dyspence, Erly and late to walke with lycence, With open walet ffreely in ech contre, Ther bulle asselyd, concludyng in sentence: Noon of this ordre is neuer lyk to the!

Digby 181, leaves 7 to 8, back.] 1 G]lory vnto God, laude and benysoun To Iohn, to Petir, &amp; also to Laurence, Which haue me take vnder proteccioun From the deluge of mortall pestilence, And from the tempest of deedly violence, And me preserved I fell not in the rage Vnder the yoke and bondis of mariage. 2 I was in purpoce for to take a wiff, And for to haue wedded with-out auysenesse, A full faire mayde; with hir to haue ladde my liff, Whom that I loued of hasty wylfulnesse; With othir ffolys talyved in distresse. And some gave councell &amp; ganne me to constreyne To be partable of ther wofull peyne. 3 They lay vpon me, and hastid me full sore, Gave me councell with hem to be bounde, And ganne to preyse eche day more &amp; more The wofull lyf in which they did habounde, And besy weren my gladnesse to confounde, Them-silf reioysyng both at eve &amp; morowe To haue a ffelowe to lyve with them in sorowe. 4 But of his grace God hath me preserved, To the wise councell of Aungelis three; From Hell[e] gates they haue my-silf conserued, In tyme of Vere when lovers lusty be, And bright Phebus was ffresshest onto see, In Gemyne, the lusty gladde seasoun, Whan I to wedde caught first occasioun. 5 My ioy was sette in especiall To wedde oon excellyng in fairnesse, And through here beaute to haue made my-silf thrall, Vnder the yoke of euerlastyng distresse; But God all oonly of his grete goodnesse Hath be an aungill as ye herde me tell, Stopped my passage from thylke perelis of Hell. 6 Amonge thise aungelis, that were in nombre thre, There appered oon oute of the South, Which that spake ffirst of all that trinite, All of oon sentence, the mater [was] well couth, And he was called “Iohn with the gildyn mouth,” Which concludith by sentence full notable, Wyves of custome be gladly variable. 7 Aftir this Iohn, the story seith also, In confirmacioun of ther ffragilite, Howe that Petyr called the Corbelio Affermyd pleynly, how wyfes gladly be Dyvers of hert, full of duplicite, Right mastirfull, hasty and eke proude, Crabbed of langage when þei lust cry lowde. 8 Who takith a wyf resceyveth a grete charge, In which he is like to haue a ffall; With tempest possede as is a sely barge; Wher he was fre, he makith hym-silf thrall, Wyves of porte been so imperyall, Husbondes dare not [theyre lustis] well gayne-say, But lowly plie, and lowly hem obey. 9[From MS. Harley 2251, leaf 155.] [The husbond euer abideth in travaile, O laboure passed, ther comyth another newe; And euery day she gynneth a bataile, With false compleynyng to chaunge chiere and hewe; Vnder suche falsenes she feyneth hir to be triewe, She makith hir husbond rude as a dul asse, Owt of whos daunger impossible is to passe.] 10 Thus wedlok is an endles penaunce, Husbondes knowe that haue experience, A martirdome and a contynuaunce Of sorowe ay lastyng, a deedly violence, And this of wyves is gladly the sentence; Vpon here husbondes when hem list be bold, Howe they allone gouerne the howsold. 11 And if the husbond happe for to thryve, She saith it is here prudent purviaunce; If they go bak ageynward and vnthryve, She sayth it is his mysgouernaunce; He berith the wite of all suche ordynaunce: If they be poure and fall in[to] distresse, She sayth it is his ffoly and his lewdnesse. 12 And if [so be] he be no spere-man good, Hit may well hap he shall haue an horn, A large bone to stuff wythall his hood, A mowe be-hynde, and fayned chere beforn; And if it ffall, that there good be lorn, By auenture at even or at morowe, The sely husbond shall haue all the sorowe. 13 The husbond hath grete cause to care, For wyff, for childe, for stuff and [for] mayne, And if ought lacke, she woll swere and stare, “He is a wastoure, and shall neuer the!” But Salamon seith, ther be thynges thre, Shrewed wyfes, rayne, and smokes blake, Makith husbondes there howses to fforsake. 14 Wyves been bestes very vnstable In ther desires, which may not chaunged be; Like a swalowe which is insaciable, Like perilous Caribdis of the trouble see, A wawe calme, full of aduersite, Whoes blandisshyng medled with myschaunce— Callid Syrenes ay full of variaunce. 15 They hem reioise to see and to be sayne, And to seke sondry pilgremages; At grete gaderynges to walken vpon the playne, And at staracles to sitte on hie stages; If they be ffaire, to shewe ther visages; If they be ffowle of look or countenaunce, They can amend it with plesaunt daliaunce. 16 Of ther nature they gretly hem delite, With holy fface fayned for the nones, In seyntuaries ther ffrendes to visite, More than for relikkes or any seyntis bones, Though they be closed vnder precious stones; To gete hem pardoun, like there olde vsages, To kys no shrynes, but lusty yong images. 17 And to conclude shortly on reasoun, To speke of wedlok, of ffoles that be blent: Ther is no more grevous ffell poysoun, Ne noon so dredfull [peryllous] serpent, As is a wyfe double in here entent; Wherfore, yonge men, to eschewe sorowe &amp; care, Withdrawe your foot, or ye ffall in the snare.

Song procedith of ioie &amp; plesaunce, And prisoun causith deth &amp; destruccioun; Ryngyng of ffeteris makith no mery soun; Or how shold he be glad or iocounde, Ageyn his wil that lith in cheynes bounde? 16 “What vaileth it a leon to be a kyng Off bestis all, shet in a tour of ston? Or an egle vndir streite kepyng, Callid also kyng of ffoules euerychon? Fy on lordship whan liberte is gon! Answer heer-to, &amp; late it nat asterte, Who syngith mery, that syngith nat of herte? 17 “But if thou wilt reioissh my syngyng, Late me go flee free fro [al] daungeer, And euery day in the morwenyng I shal repair vn-to thi laurer And fresshly syng with lusty notis cleer Vndir thi chaumbir or aforn thyn halle, Euery sesoun whan thou list me calle. 18 “To be shet vp &amp; pynned vndir drede Nothyng accordith vn-to my nature; Thouh I were fed with mylk &amp; wastelbred, And swete cruddis brouht to my pasture, Yit hadde I leuer do my besy cure Erly on morwe to shrape[n] in the vale To fynde my dyner among the wormes smale. 19 “The labourer is gladder at his plow, Erly on morwe to feede hym on bacoun, Than som man is, that hath tresour inow Of all deyntes, plente &amp; foisoun, And hath no fredam, with his pocessioun, To gon at large, but as a bere at stake, To passe his boundis, but if he leve take. 20 “Take this answeer for a ful conclusioun, To syng in prisoun thou shalt me neuer constreyn, Tyl I have fredam in woodis vp and doun, To flee at large on bouhis rouh &amp; pleyn; And of resoun thou shuldist nat disdeyn Of my desir, but lawhen &amp; haue game, But who is a cherl wold eche man were the same.” 21 “Weel,” quod the cherl, “sith it wole nat be That I desir, as be thi talkyng, Maugre thi wil thou shalt chese oon of three, Withyn a cage myryly to syng, Or to the kechen I shal thi body bryng, Pulle thi ffetherys that be so briht &amp; cleere, And aftir roste, or bake to my dyneer.” 22 Than quod the brid:—“To resoun sei nat I nay, Touchyng my song a ful resoun thu hast, And whan my fetheris pullid ben away Yiff I be rostid othir bake in past, Thou shalt of me haue a ful small repast; But yiff thou wilt werkyn bi my counsail, Thou maist bi me han passyng gret avail. 23 “Yiff thou wilt on-to my rede assent, And sofre me gon frely fro prisoun Without raunsom or any othir rent, I shal the yeve a notable gret gwerdoun, Thre greete wisdames, accordyng to resoun, More of availe, take heed what I do profre, Than al the gold that is shett in thi coofre. 24 “Trust me weel I shal the nat disseive, Whoo that shal teche, of resoun he shal go fre.” “Weel,” quod the cherl, “telle on, anoon lat see.” “Nay,” quod the brid, “thou shalt anon conceyve, It sitt a mayster to have his liberte, And at large to have his lessoun, Have me nat suspectt, I meene no tresoun.” 25 “Weel,” quod the cherl, “I hold me weel content, I trust the promys which thou hast made to me.” The brid fley forth, the cherl was at assent, And took hir fliht vp to the lawrer tre. Than thouht she thus:—“Now that I stond[e] free, With snarys, panteris, I cast nat al my live, Nor with no lymetwigges any more to stryve. 26 “He is a fool, that skapid is daunger, Hath brooke his ffeteris, &amp; fled is from prisoun, For to resort; for brent child dredith fyer; Eche man bewar, of wisdam &amp; resoun, Of sugre strowid, that hidith fals poisoun; Ther is no venym so perlious of sharppnesse, As whan it hath of triacle a liknesse. 27 “Whoo dredith no perel, in perel he shal falle; Smothe watres beth oft-sithis deepe; The quaile-pipe can most falsly calle, Til the quaile vndir the nett doth creepe; A blereyde fowler trust nat, thouh he weepe, Eschew his thombe, of wepyng take non heed, That smale briddis can nype bi the hed. 28 “And now that I sich daungers am askapid, I wole bewar, &amp; a-forn provide, That of no fowler I wole no more be iapid, From ther lyme-twiggis I wol fleen ferr a-side, Wher perel is, gret perel is tabide;— Com nere thou cherl, take heed [vn-]to my speche, Of thre wisdamys that I wole the teche. 29 “Yiff nat of wisdam to hasty credence To euery tale, nor to eche tidyng, But considre of reson &amp; prudence Mong many talis is many grett lesyng; Hasty credence hath causid gret hyndryng, [Report of talis, &amp; tydynges brought vp new Makith many a man to be hold vntrewe.] 30 “For oo party take this for my raunsoun; Lerne the secounde, groundid on Scriptur: Desir thou nat bi no condicioun Thyng that is inpossible to recur; Wordly desires stond al in aventure, And whoo disireth to clymbe to hih a-loftt, Bi sodeyn torn, felith often his fal vnsoftt. 31 “The thridde is this, bewar, bothe eue &amp; morwe, Forgete it nat, but lerne this of me: For tresour lost make nevir to grett sorwe, Which in no wise may recured be; For who takith sorwe for losse in that degre, Rekne first his losse, &amp; aftir rekne his peyne, Off oo sorwe, he makith sorwis tweyne.” 32 Aftir this lessoun the brid began a song, Off hir escape gretly reioisshi[n]g, And she, remembring also of the wrong Don bi the cherl, first, at hir takyng, Off hir affray &amp; of hir prisonyng, Glad that she was at large &amp; out of dreede, Said on-to hym, houyng above his hede:— 33 “Thou were,” quod she, “a verry natural foole, To sofre me departe of thi lewdnesse, Thou aughtist of riht to pleyn &amp; makyn deole, And in [thyn] hert[e] han grett hevynesse That thou hast lost so passyng gret richesse, Which myht suffise bi valew in rekeny[n]g To pay the raunsom of a myhty kyng. 34 “Ther is a ston which callid is iagounce, Off old engendrid withynne my entrayle, Which of fyne gold peiseth a gret vnce, Citryne of colour, lik garnetes of entaile, Which makith men victorious in bataile, And who-so-euer bere on hym this stoon Is ful assured of his mortal foon. 35 “Who hath this stoon in poscessioun, Shal sofre no povert, nor non indigence, But of all tresour haue plente &amp; foisoun, And euery man shal doon hym reverence, And noon enmye shal hym doon offence; But from thyn handis now that I am goon, Pleyn if þou wilt, for thi part is noon. 36 “It causith love, it makith men gracious And favorabil in euery mannys siht, It makith accord attween folk envious, Comfortith sorweful, makyth hevy hertis liht, Lik thopasion of colour sonnyssh bright;— I am a fool to telle þe al attonys, Or teche a cherl the prys of precious stonys. 37 “Men shuld nat put a precious margarite As rubies, saphires or othir stonys ynde, Emeroudes, nor othir perlis whihte To fore rude swyn, that love draff of kynde; For a sowe delitith, as I fynde, Moore in fowle draff hir pyggis for to glade, Than in all the perre, that cometh of Garnade. 38 “Ech þing drawith vn-to his semblable: Fissh in the see, bestis on the stronde, The eyr for fowlis of natur is covenable, To a plowman for [to] tyle his londe, And to a cherl, a mookfork in his honde; I lese my tyme any moor to tarye, [To telle a bovir of the lapidarye]. 39 “That thou haddist, thou getist no more ageyn, Thy lyme twyggis &amp; panteeris I defye. To lete me gon thou were fowle ovir-seyn, To leese thi richesse only for folie; I am now free, to syngen &amp; to flie Wher that me list, &amp; he is a fool at all That goth at large, &amp; makith hym-silf thrall. 40 “To heeryn a wisdam thyn eris ben half deeff, Lik an asse that listeth on a harpe, Thou maist go pypen in a ivy leeff; Bett is to me to syngyn on thornes sharpe, Than in a cage, with a cherl to karpe, For it was seyd of ffolkis yoore a-goon, A cherlis cherl ful oft is woo-bigoon!” 41 The cherl felt his hert[e] parte on tweyn, For verry sorwe, and a-sondry rive. “Allas,” quod he, “I may weel weepe &amp; pleyn As a wretche nevir lik to thryve, But for tendewr in povert al my live, For of foly &amp; of wilfulnesse I have now lost al holly my richesse. 42 “I was a lord, I crie, ‘Out on fortune!’ Hadde gret tresour late in my kepyng, Which myht haue made me long to contune With thilk[e] ston to have lived lik a kyng, Yif that I hadde sett it in a ryng, Born it on me, I hadde had good i-nowh, I shold no more haue goon on-to the plowh!” 43 Whan the brid sauh the cherl thus moorne, And how that he was hevy of his cheere, She took hir fliht, and gan ageyn retoorne, Towardis hym, &amp; seide as ye shal here:— “O dulle cherl! wisdames for to leere That I the tauht, al is left bi-hynde, Racid awey, and cleene out of thi mynde. 44 “Tauht I the nat this wisdam in sentence: To every tale brouht to the of newe, Nat hastily yeue ther-to credence, Into tyme thou knowe that it were trewe? All is nat gold that shewith goldissh hewe, Nor stoonys all bi natur, as I fynde, Be nat saphires that shewe colour ynde. 45 “In this doctryne I lost my labour, To teche the sich proverbis of substaunce. Now maist thou seen thi blynded lewde errour; For al my body, peised in balaunce, Weieth nat an vnce, rewde is thi remembraunce, I to have moore peise closyd in myn entraile, Than al my body set for the countirtaile. 46 “Al my body weieth nat an vnce, How myht I than have in me a stoon, That peisith more than doth a grett iagounce? Thi brayn is dul, thi witt is al-most goon, Off thre wisdamys thou hast forgeten on, Thou shuldist nat, aftir my sentence, To euery tale yeue to hasty credence. 47 “I bad al-so, bewar bothe day &amp; morwe, For thyng lost of sodeyn aventur, Thou sholdist nat make to mych sorwe, Whan thou seest thou maist it nat recur; Heer thou failist, which doost thi besi cur In thi snare to catche me ageyn, Thou art a fool, thi labour is in veyn. 48 “In the thridde also thou dost rave, I bad thou sholdist in no maner wyse, Coueite thyng which thou maist nat have, In which thou hast forgeten myn emprise, That I may seyn, pleynly to devise, Thou hast of madnesse forgeten all thre Notable wisdamys, which I tauht[e] the. 49 “It were but foly with the for to carpe, Or to preche of wisdamys more or lasse, I hold hym mad that bryngith foorth an harpe, Ther-on to teche a rude, for-dullid asse; And mad is he that syngith a fool a masse; And he most mad that dooth his besynesse To teche a cherl termys of gentilnesse. 50 “And semblably in Aprill and in May, Whan gentil briddis make most melodie, The cookkow syngen can but o lay, In othir tymes she hath no fantasye; Thus euery thyng, as clerkes specifie, Frute on trees, &amp; folk of euery age, Fro whens thei cam, [thei taken] a tarage. 51 “The vynteneer tretith of his holsom wynes, Off gentil frute bostith the gardeneer, The ffissher cast his hookis &amp; his lynes, To catche ffissh in euery fresh ryveer, Of tilthe of lond tretith the boveer, The cherl deliteth to speke of ribaudye, The hunter to speek of venerye. 52 “All oon to the a ffaucoun &amp; a kyte, As good an oule as a popyngay, A donghyl doke, as deynte as a snyte; Whoo serveth a cherl hath many a carful day. Adieu, Sir Cherl, farwell, I flye my way ; I cast me nevir hensforth, my lyvyng, Aforn a cherl anymore to syng!” Verba auctoris. Ye folk that shal this fable seen &amp; rede, New forgid talis counceilith yow to flee, For losse of good takith no gret heede, Beeth nat to sorwefful for noon aduersite, Coveitith no-thyng that may nat bee, And remembrith, wheer that euer ye gon, A cherlis cherl is alwey woo-begon. Lenvoie. 54 Vn-to purpoos this proverbe is ful riff, Rad &amp; reportid bi oold remembraunce: A childis brid. and a knaves wyff Have oft[e] sithe gret sorwe &amp; myschaunce. Whoo hath freedam, hath al suffisaunce, Better is freedam with litel in gladnesse, Than to be thral in al wordly richesse. 55 Go, litel quaier, &amp; recomaunde me Vn-to my maistir with humble affeccioun; Beseche hym lowly, of mercy &amp; pite, Of thi rude makyng to have compassioun; And as touchyng thi translacioun Out of the Frenssh, how-euyr the Englysh be, All thyng is seide vndir correccioun With supportacioun of your benyngnyte. Explicit Fabula de Ave &amp; Rustico. 21. FABULA DUORUM MERCATORUM. [MS. B.M. Harley 2255, leaves 72 to 88.] 1 In Egipt whilom, as I reede and fynde, Ther dwellyd a marchaunt of hih &amp; gret estat, Nat oonly riche, but bountevous and kynde, As of nature to hym it was innat (For alle vertues in hym wern aggregat); Of vices voyd, pitous and merciable, And of his woord, as any centre, stable. 2 But, as me thynkith, it were convenient, Or in this tale I any ferther passe, For to descryve to you, that be present, Wher that this contre stant and in what place; And, if I erre, I put me in your grace: Forberith me now and heerith paciently; For, as myn auctour seith, riht so sey I. 3 This riche lond, moost passaunt of plente, With Surry marchith toward thorient, On which syde is eek the Rede Se; And Libye stant ful in the occident; Who castith the coostys of the firmament, The Grete Se northward shal he fynde And ferre by south Ethiope and Ynde. 4 As auctours witnesse, this lond is desolat Of cloude and reynes aboute in euery yle, But yeer by yeer the soil is irrigat And ouyrflowyd with the fflood of Nyle, The which endurith but a certeyn whyle, As for a norshyng, her frutys to fecunde, With corn and greyn to make the lond habounde. 5 Of sondry frutys and of marchaundise Thoruh out envyroun it is so plentevous, What mercymony that men list devise, Is ther ful reedy and ful copious. I hold it best to be compendious: Of al richesse ther is such habundaunce, That euery wiht hath ther[of] suffisaunce. 6 This worthy marchaunt, this Egipcien, Which I of spak, was named ferre and wyde; For many oon, that hym had [neuer] seen, Spak of his name, which gladly wol nat hyde. And in a contre cald Baldac ther besyde Anothir marchaunt, as by relacioun, Of hym hadde herd and of his hih renoun. 7 This latter marchaunt was eek a worthy man, Ful weel belovid also in his contre; In trouthe he hadde al, that euyr he wan, And hym governyd evirmore in honeste. From ech to othir the name began to fle, That by report and by noon othir mene Of her too lovys was maad a stable chene. 8 Revoluyth ech by contemplacioun Al of his freend the lyknesse and ymage: Thynkyng hath grave with deep impressioun Ech othris fourme, stature and visage; Her hertys eye did alwey her message, And mynde medleth in the memorial And fet his foode in the ffantastical. 9 Thorugh-out her erys wellyd of memorye The soun of fame of hem so ferre-i-fet Hath past and wonne the castel of victorye: Foryetilnesse ne may it nat vnshet; Love berith the keye and also the cliket, As trewe porteer, that they mot needys dwelle (So ar they loke) withyne myndys selle. 10 Vertu goth ferre, he may nat hyde his liht: Withoute feet a gret paas doth he renne, And, wher he shyneth, no dirknesse of the nyht His beemys dymmen, nor no cloude of synne. Withoute smoke fire ne may nat brenne, And gladly vertu wil in-to vertu trace To seeke his feer in euery coost or place. 11 For, riht as falsnesse anoon fyndith out his feere, So trouthe and trouthe as faste been at accorde; Tweyne of o kynde togidre drawe neere, So strong of nature is the myhty corde. Kynde is in werkyng a ful myhty lorde: In love he lynketh hem, that be vertuous, Riht as dissoluen thynges, that be contrarious. 12 For lich of lich is serchyd and enqueerid: To merthe longith to fynden out gladnesse, And wo can weepe, thouh he be nat leryd, And dool eek drawith vnto drerynesse; Honour is weddyd vnto worthynesse. Vnto his semblable thus euery thyng can drawe, And nothyng bynde hem, but natur by hir lawe. 13 Repoort of vertu oonly by audience From ech to othir hath brouht the blisful soun Of thes too marchauntis disseueryd by absence, That they been oon, as by affeccioun; Ther may be maad no divisioun. With-oute siht ech is to othir deere, Love hath her hertys so soore set affyre. 14 By lond or se the good her chapmen carye Was entircomownyd by her bothys assent: Yiff oon hadde ouht plesaunt or necessarye, Vnto the tothir anoon he hath it sent. So ful they were of oon accordement, As oon in too and too in oon for euere, That nought, but deth, her love may disseuere. 15 Ferthere to telle, how it fel of thes too, As fortune wolde and eek necessite, That he of Baldac to Egipt mvst goo For marchaundise, that was in that contre. Ful glad he was, that he his freend shal see: A blisful wynd in-to his seyl hath blowe His ship to dryve, ther as he may hym knowe. 16 Whan that he was arryved vnto londe, For ioye hym thouhte, he was in Paradys; For euery lovere may weel vndirstonde, That of frenship the moost sovereyn blys Is for to be withouten any mys In thilke place, wher rootid is his herte, For to relese of love his peynes smerte. 17 For, riht as afftir the blake nyht of sorwe Gladnesse folwith thoruh suyng of the day, And fressh flourys displayen by the morwe, That wern toforn in dirknesse and affray, And afftir wyntir sweth greene May: Riht so of ffreendys her tristesse for to fyne Is liht of presence, whan it to them may shyne. 18 O out on absence of hem, that loven trewe! O out on partyng by disseveraunce! O ground of woo, of her feuere newe (I meene, of freendys, that langour in distaunce)! O bittir bale hangyng in ballaunce! On the a clamour now I wil begynne, That causist lovers assondir for to twynne. 19 But, as to them, that han i-tastyd galle, Mor aggreable is the hoony soote, Riht so to them, that wern in myscheef falle, Is, whan they heryn kalendys of her boote. Of lovers art ful bittir is the roote, But weel is hym, that may the frute atteyne, As whilom diden thes noble marchauntis tweyne. 20 For, whan that he of Egipt herde seye, How that his freend was entryd in-to the londe, For verray ioye he felte his herte pleye, And hym tencontre, he seyde, he wolde fonde, And, whan they mette, he took hym by the honde And kist hym aftir, and with vnfeyned cheere He seide: “Wolcom, my feithful freend so deere. 21 Now haue I found, that I so longe haue souht.” “Wolcom,” he seide by rowe an hundryd sithe, And to his place anoon he hath hym brouht And hym receyved with herte glad and blithe. He maad his menee her deveer doon as swithe, That al wer reedy, that myht be to hym ese: So fayn he was his freend to queeme and plese. 22 Vnto a chaumbre ful riche and weel arrayed Anoon he lad hym, which stood somwhat on heihte, And seide: “Freend, I am ful weel appayed, That I be grace of you haue cauht a sihte; For nothyng moore myn herte myht[e] lihte; Wherfore wolcom, also God me save, Vn-to your owne, and to al that I have.” 23 Of mete and drynk, deyntees and vitaille, Of divers wynes ther was no skarsete, Of straunge viaundys in sondry apparaille, That nevir aforn was seen such roialte: To moore and lasse it snowyd doun plente. To rekken the fare and cours in thrifty wyse A somerys day ne myht[e] nat suffise. 24 The riche beddyng of swte so weel beseyne, Passaunt and plesyng eek, the roial paramentis, That for his freend this marchaunt did ordeyne, With al the soun of dyvers instrumentys, Revel disguysed with chaung of garnementis, Of song and musyk the merthe and melodye— Al to reherse my witt I can nat plye. 25 They ryde aboute with hauk &amp; eek with houndys, He shewith hym maneers, castellis and eek tours; Thoruh al his lordship he lat hym in the boundys By park, by forest, by meedwys fressh of flowrs; And, list he were pryked with paramours, Ful many a lady and maiden by his side On white palfreys he made for to ryde. 26 Of al his tresour withyne and withoute Nothyng he hidith: of al he hadde a siht. He saide: “Freend, withouten any doute, What so I haue, is platly in your myht. I feffe you fully in al my good and riht. Beth glad and wolcom: I can sey you no more. Haue her myn hand for now and evirmore.” 27 This straunge marchaunt thankyth hym with herte: Nay, “straunge” nat; allas, why seid I soo? I spak amys, this woord now me asterte, Sith in accord confederat been they too. The boond is maad bothe for wele and woo. I erryd foule to speke of straungenesse Of tweyne allyed, so kneet in stabilnesse. 28 But, as I seyde, with al herte entieer His freend he thankith of entent ful cleene, For now presence hath maad the wedir cleer, Of absence chacyd the mystis ful of teene. Her ioiful somer is tapited al in greene, Of stable blew is her bothen hewe To shewe that too in love wer nevir so trewe. 29 This blisful lyff from day to day they leede, Tyl that fortune to them had enmyte. Allas, for dool myn herte I feele bleede; For evir vnwarly cometh aduersite. This straunge marchaunt hath cauht infirmyte: A brennyng feuere so soore did hym shake, That fro the deth he trowith nat to skape. 30 A bed in haste was maad ful softely, In which he cowchyd, and gan to sike and groone. His prayeer was to alle pitously, That by hym-silf he myhte been alloone: So kowde he best yeuen issu to his moone. But than his freend for woo began to melte, That al his peynes, he seemyd, that he felte. 31 Thus longith it to freendys, entirparte Nat oonly merthe, but wo and hevynesse: Yif oon hath peyne, bothe hertis it doth thoruh-darte, Yif that her love be set in sikirnesse, And, yif oon drye, bothe they haue distresse. This is the ballaunce oonly of freendys riht: Euenly to deele, wher they be glad or liht. 32 And for tassaye, yif it myht [hym] ese, The chaunbre is voyded, and he is left al sool. Than to hym-seluen he spak in his disese And seid: “Allas, my langour and my dool! Now hoot, now coold I erre, as doth a fool. Allas, and yit the cheffest of my peyne Is, that I dar to no wiht weel compleyne. 33 “I am [i-] hurt, but closyd is my wounde: My dethis spere strykith in my brest; My bollyng festrith, that it may nat sounde, And yit no cicatrice shewith at the lest. Cupidis darte on me hath maad arrest: The cleer streemys of castyng of an ye This is tharwe, me causith for to dye. 34 “And at myn herte is hoolly, that I feele, But aftir cure, God wot, I dar nat seche. My sweete fo is hard as any steele. Allas! vnmercy doth to cruel wreche; For thilke flour, that myhte be my leche, She wot riht nouht, what wo that I endure, And to be ded I dar me nat discure. 35 “And eek my freend, whom I love moost of al, Yif that he knewh my secre maladye, Ful cruel vengaunce shuld vpon me fal For myn outrage, despiht and velanye, That I durst evir clymbyn vp so hihe To love that maiden kept for his owne stoor: Thus must I deyen; what shuld I pleynen mor? 36 “I sauh ful many ladyes in the rowte So fayr, so fressh i-brouht for my plesaunce, But now for oon my liff lith al in dowte, That of my deth ther is noon avoidaunce: And yit the thyng, that doth me moost grevaunce, Is, that I shulde to hym I am so bounde Disnatural or traitour been i-founde. 37 “For thilke goodly, that he lovyd moost, I am abowte falsly hym to reve. Love can no frenship, I se weel, in no coost. Allas, Cupide disseyvable for to leve. Love rechchith nat his freend [to] wrath and greve. Allas, of love such is the fervent heete, That litil chargith his freend for to leete.” 38 And, whil he lay in langour thus musyng, His freend wol besy was with al his myht To serche aboute the lond envirounnyng: His menee riden bothe day and niht To founden som man, that wer expert arriht, Or phisicien, for no cost wold he spare To haue restoored the sike to weelfare. 39 Assemblyd been of leechis many oon, The beste and wisest, that he coude ffynde. Vnto the sike they been i-comen echoon To taste his poorys and for to deeme his kynde. The[i] were ful besy to fynd out roote and rynde, Of what humour was causyd his dissese, And theron werke his accesse to appese. 40 With hem they brouhte, yif they sey[e] neede, Ful goode siropys to make dygestyues, And therwithal the sonnere for to speede Pelotes expert for evacuatyues, Ful precious poudrys and confortatives, That, whan they knew of maladyes the roote, Nouht were behynden to werken for his boote. 41 Whan they haue serchid by signes his estat, They merveyle gretly what it myht[e] be, That his fevere was nat interpollat, But ay contynueth hoot and in oo degre. They seide, certeyn, it was noon of the thre, But yif it were oonly effymora; For neithir etyk it was ne putrida. 42 Effymera hath his original Whan mannys spiritys been in distemperaunce, Or in-to excesse yif a wiht be fal Of mete and drynk thoruh mysgovernaunce: Of accidentis, of thouht, of perturbaunce, Of hoot, of cold or greef in any maneer This feuere cometh, as auctours tellen heer. 43 And putrida is causyd gladly thus: Whan any humour synneth in quantite, Or whan his flowyng is to plentevous, That he excedith mesoure in qualite. Yiff by blood, anoon ye may it see; Yif quantite ouht erre, espyeth it thus, The fevere in phisyk is callyd sinochus. 44 And, yiff the humour in qualite exceedith, Or heete or blood passe his temperament, In-to a fevere anoon a man it leedith Clepid synocha by putrefaccioun shent. And, yif of colra he take his groundement, Pure or vnpure, citryn or vitellyne, Gyles you techith to iuge it by vryne. 45 Also of etikes ther be kyndes thre, But oon ther is pereilous in special, The which is, whan by [any] degre Deeply profoundid is heete natural In thilke humydite i-callyd radical; The which ffevere is gladly incurable, For drye tisyk is withal partable. 46 Off othir humours han thes leechys eek Ful deepe enqueeryd to serchen out the trouthe By every weye, that they cowde seek: In hem was ffounde defawte noon nor slouthe; But atte laste of o thyng ha they routhe, That he were falle, for ouht they cowd espye, For thouht or love into malencolye. 47 His vryne was remys, attenuat By resoun gendryd of ffrigidite, The veyne ryueers, for they wern oppilat, It was ful thynne and wannyssh for to see; The streihte passage causyd aquosite, Withoute substaunce to voyde hym of colour, That they dispeired been by his socour. 48 For, whan nature of vertu regitiff Thoruh malencolye is pressyd and bor doun, It is to dreede gretly of the liff, But soone be ordeyned opposicioun; For it was likly, that this passioun Was eithir thouht or love, that men calle Amor ereos, that he was in falle. 49 The roote wherof and the corrupcioun Is of thilke vertu callid estimatiff, As yif a man haue deep impressioun, That ovirlordshipith his imagynatif, And that the cours be forth successyf To trowe a wiht for love mor fayr or pure, Than evir hym ordeyned hath God or nature. 50 This causith man to fallen in manye, So arn his spiritis vexid by travayle. Allas, that man shuld fallen in ffrenesye For love of woman, that litil may avayle! For now thes leechys, as by supposayle, Konne of this man noon othir ffevir espye, But that for love was hool his malladye 51 And, whan his freend the sothe gan vndirgrope Of this myscheef, he nat ne wolde abide; But in to the chaunbyr anoon he is i-lope And kneelyd adoun by his beddys syde. He seyd: “Freend, to me nothyng thu hyde: Telle me your herte, telle me your hevynesse, And lat no thouht causen your drerynesse. 52 “Yiff loues ffevere do yow ouht to quake, Telle me the soth and rake nat in the fyre. Out of your slombre, for shame, why nyl ye wake? To me vncloose the somme of your desyre. Be what she be, I shal do my deveere. Allas, mystrust to lokke it vp fro me! Telle on, for shame, com of and lat me see! 53 “Your freend mystruste, it is an hih repreeff, Or to concele from hym your priuyte. Parauenture he may to your myscheeff Fynde remedye sonnere, than may ye. And sith in feith so deepe i-sworn be we, I wol it weten withouten mor delay, What may you helpyn, by God and by my fay.” 54 And alle the ladyes and maydenys of his hous, Bothe oold and yong, were brouht to his presence. And oon ther was so fair and vertuous, That for hir wysdam and hir excellence Was moost of alle had in reverence, The which this marchaunt for oon the beste alyve Kept in his hous in purpoos hir to wyve. 55 Ful wys she was of so tendir age, Prudent and war and ful of honeste, Devoyde cleene of vices and outrage, Whos beaute flouryd and virginite, Plesaunt of poort, roote of humylite, Of maneer myrour and welle of womanheede, Goodly abayssht and ffemynyn of dreede. 56 Hool of hir herte, benygne and immvtable, Nat frel, fadyng, but ful of affiaunce, In moral vertu mesuryd and tretable, Housoold to guye ful war of governaunce: To been exaunple, kynde hir lyst avaunce, That, yif I shal hir shortly comprehende, In hir was nothyng, that nature myht amende. 57 The sike marchaunt, whan he hir beheeld, With dreedful herte and voys ful tymerous He seide: “Certis, but mercy be my sheeld To you, my freend, that ye be gracious, That on my trespas ye be nat rigerous To take vengaunce on myn hih folye, That I was boold to sette myn herte so hihe. 58 “O, mercy, freend, and rewe vpon my liff: Deth fro my gilt, I wot, is resounable. Love is gynnere and ground of al my striff. But in o thyng I am inexcusable, That I so love that fayr incomperable, Which is to you so plesaunt and so meete: And, to be slayn, to love I can nat leete. 59 “Do, what yow list: for, tyl myn herte ryve, I may nat chesyn, that I am hir man; For, with my silf thouh I evirmor stryve, Ther is noon othir, that I love can; For hir in syknesse I am so pale and wan. Thus I me confesse and put me in your grace: My liff, my deeth is portrayed in hir face.” 60 This freendly marchaunt of this nat dysmayed, But with good herte saide, as ye may heere: “Allas, my freend, why art thu so dismayed For love, anoon sith thu maist han hir heere With al hir beaute and cristal eyen cleere? Betwix yow too in love to make a boond, I gyf hir the: haue, tak hir by the hond. 61 “And ful and hool, as I haue any riht, I give hir the, which is so wys and sage. Rys vp anoon and be riht glad and liht, For I wil makyn between yow the maryage And bere thexpence fully and costage Of your weddyng,” and hath a day i-set Of hir spousayl to see the knotte i-knet. 62 Anoon he ros supportyd by gladnesse, And doun he fel lowly on his kne, And hym he thankyd for his gentillesse, That fro the deth hath maad hym skapid fre. “Allas,” he seide, “whan shal I thanken the, That hast so freely thyn owne love forsake Thy freend to save, and hool and sound to make?” 63 The passaunt costys, the feeste of her weddyng, Iustys and revel and al the purveiaunce, The grete yiftys, the cheer so surmountyng— I wante witt to telle the circumstaunce; For Ymeneus, that hath the governaunce Of such feestys to make accordement, Therto Fortune was therat present. 64 Thus is the syke of his langour lissyd, The blosme of bounte by frenshipe hath he wonne; For hertly merthe to hym is now nat myssyd, No shadwe of sorwe forfarith nat his sonne, His freend to hym abrochyd hath the tonne Of freendly triacle; for nevir I radde yit, O freend to a-nothir that so weel hath hym quyt. 65 To hym relesyd he hath his hertly glorye, Hym silf dismyttid of his inward ioye; The briht myrour, the liht of his memorye, Which al his rancour by refut cowde coye, He hath forsake, the guyere of his ioye, His lives lanterne, staff of his crokyd age, To bryng his freend in quiete out of rage. 66 Off this mateer what shuld I write mor? I wil entrete this processe forth in pleyn: Hir and hir iowellys, hir richesse and hir stor He hath hym youen, the stoory seith certeyn, And hom with al repayred is ageyn And lad hir with hym, as was his freendys wyl, Which cowde nat feyne his plesaunce to fulfyl. 67 At ther departyng the moornyng for to wite, The wooful teerys, dolour and hevynesse, Myn herte bleedith, whan I therof endite, To knowe her trouble, turment and distresse. But of this marchaunt lyst the kyndenesse: His freendys partyng did hym mor to smerte Than love of hir, that sat so nyh his herte. 68 Moornyng for absence he is lefft allone: The tothir streiht to Baldoc, his contre, With wyff and catel the riht weye is gone And ther receyved with gret solennyte. Her lyff they ledde in gret prosperite, His wif and he of oon herte in quyete: For with a bettir no man ne myht mete. 69 Ther was no stryff between hem nor debate, But ful accordid they be bothe nyht and day; She hym obeyeth in al erlich and late: Whan he seid “ya,” she coud nat sey “nay”, A bettir wyff was nevir at al assay; Ioyned in oon thus been her hertys too, That nouht, but deth, her love may fordoo. 70 For alle wyves, as ferre as evir I kneuh, Withyne her brest hath growyng pacience: Suffryng and meeke they been ilich[e] new; But yiff so be, that men hem doon offence, They love nat, men make experience Of her lownesse. But lyst I hem displese, Ye gete no more: passe ovir is an ese. 71 Thus leve I hem in her iolite (I meene thes too), ech lykyng othir weel; I speke no mor of her felicite: For no man may such ioye &amp; merthe feel, But he were expert to telle it euerydeel. For to the marchaunt of Egipt will I turne, Which for his freend in woo I lefte moorne. 72 But now, allas, who shal my stile guye, Or hen[ne]s forth who shall be my muse? For verray dool I stond in iupartye: Al merthe of makyng my mateer mot refuse. Me in-to stoon transmwed hath Meduse For verray stonyng of Fortunys fikylnesse, That for the merveyle no woord I can expresse. 73 Allas, Meggera, I mot now vnto the Of herte calle to helpe me compleyne And to thy sustir eek, Thesiphone, That afftir ioye goddessys been of peyne. O weepyng Mirre, now lat thy teerys reyne In-to myn ynke so clubbyd in my penne, That rowthe in swaggyng abrood[e] make it renne. 74 It sitt the nat enlwmyned for to be Of othir colour but oonly al of sable. O doolful mateer! who so now reede the, He may weel seyn, this world is ful chaungable; For, how this marchaunt whilom so worshipable (I meene of Egipt) Fortune did avale, Mot be as now [the] remenaunt of my tale. 75 To hym Fortune hir falsnesse hath overt, Hir swift[e] wheel turned vp so doun; For he is ffallen and plonget in povert Thoruh vanysshyng of his possessioun. Now al is brouht in-to destruccioun: Rychesse and freendys been alle i-feere goon, And he in myscheef is sool i-lefft aloon. 76 This newe Iob, i-cast in indigence, He weepith, wayleth, soleyn and solitarye; Allone he drouh hym fleeyng al presence, And evir his liff he gan to curse and warye. “O, out on neede of malys multipharye”: He gan to crye in his ire and woo, Lych a man in furye for-poosyd to and froo. 77 For remembraunce of oold prosperite Hath with a darte hym woundid to the herte. Mor vnkouth was to hym aduersite, That nevir to-forn no trouble did hym smerte; For mor despeyred he was for a sterte, That he ne hadde of woo noon excersise: Hym thouhte, it was to hym a newe emprise. 78 Thus is the sweete of his tranquyllite Ful neewly turned in-to bittirnesse; Thus is he valyd adoun from hih degre Ful many a steiher lowe in-to wrechydnesse. His lyff he leedith al in werynesse; For now Fortune hath chaungid newe his weede: Freend nor foo ne took of hym noon heede. 79 But, by hym-silf walkyng in wildirnesse, He gan to pleyne his sodeyn poore estaat And seide: “Allas, wher is the kyndenesse Of alle my freendys to me disconsolaat? I pley[e] sool, I am almoost chek-maat: That whilom hadde my menee me aboute, Now destitut I am beshet withoute. 80 “Now am I repreef to my freendys alle, Markyd of many and of the peeple fable. Now wot I nat, to whom for helpe calle, That sat so glorious somtyme at my table; And they, that than wer to me servisable, Han by despit at myscheef me forsake. Gret cause haue I an outcry for to make. 81 “O out on shame of hauhtesse plongid lowe! O out on dolour of lordship brouht to nouht! O out on richesse with vanyte forblowe, Forsakyng soone and with gret travayle souht! O worldly blisse, of me ful dere abouht, Thy sodeyn turn now doublith my grevaunce Mor than of it I nevir hadde had plesaunce. 82 “Now hongir, thrust, vnkouth as vnto me, Vnwarly sweth my passyd habundaunce. Now cold, now nakyd in necessite I walke aboute for my sustenaunce. Whilom in plente and now al in grevaunce! Allas, my fulle is derkyd in-to wane, With wynd forwhirlyd as is a mvaunt ffane. 83 “O, in this world what woo and werynesse, What mortal torment assaileth al aboute! What grevous molest and what besynesse With many assaut in dreed doth vs to doute! Now vp, now doun, as doth a curraunt goute, So ar we travailed with solicitude: The world with mowhes so weel can vs delude. 84 “But I knowe weel, who trustith on the moost, Shal be deceyued, whan he to the hath neede. Wher is the clarioun of thy cry and boost, That to [the] skyes my fame did[e] beede? Who seruyth the, what shal be his meede: Whan that he wenyth thu maist hym most availe, Than in the hand rathest thu wilt hym fayle?” 85 O seely marchaunt, myn hand I feele quake To write thy woo in my translacioun; Ful offte I weepe also for thy sake, For to beholde the revolucioun Of thy degree and transmutacioun. Allas, to the I can no bet diffence Than the to arme strongly in pacience. 86 Nat oonly thu, but euery man on lyve, How hih in throne he sittith exaltat, Lat hym nat tempte ageyn[e]s God to stryve, But take his sonde meekly withoute debat; For who so do, he is infortunat. No wele is worthy, that may no woo endure, Wherfor ech man tak paciently his ewre. 87 For Senek seith with ful hih sentence Of preef in povert, who-so that hym reede, In thylke book he made of providence, That he vnhappy is, withouten dreede, Which nevir ne hadde adversite nor neede, Of whom the goddys dempten pleynly thus: “Withouten assay no man is vertuous.” 88 “And yiff a tre with frut be ovirlade,” In his Epistles he seith, as ye may see, “Both braunche and bouh wol enclyne and fade. And greyne oppressith to moche vberte. Riht so it farith of fals felicite, That yif his weihte mesure do exceede, Than of a fal gretly is to dreede.” 89 But, why that God this marchaunt list visite, As I suppose, it was hym for to preeve. Thouh he were wooful, he was the lasse wite, Sith nevir afforn Fortune did hym greeve. From his wantrust he was brouht in beleeve, That he weel kneuh, this world was ful vnstable And nat abydyng, but evirmor variable. 90 And, whan he kneuh the grete vnsikyrnesse Of worldly lust by preef in special, On knees he fel with devout humblesse, Ful lowe of herte, and thankyd God of al, And sayde: “Lord, thouh I haue had a fal, Ne put me nat fro thy proteccioun, Sith I it take for my probacioun. 91 “But, goode Lord, lat me Thy grace fynde And guye my wittis, that I be nat despeyred; But me enspeere, puttyng in my mynde Som hoope of refut, that am so soore appeyred. And, thouh to richesse ther be no grees i-steyred Tascenden vp, as I was wont to doone, Yit, goode Lord, do confort to my boone.” 92 And, whil he lay thus in his orisoun, Ful poorly clad in ful symple weede, His herte was brouht in consolacioun, Which in-to lissyng his langour did leede. He thouhte, he wolde preeve his freend at neede; And vnto Baldac, for to make assay, In pilgrym wise he took the rihte way. 93 And, whan he was comen to that londe, Ful soore afferd he was for to compleyne. “Allas!” he seide, “myn herte dar nat fonde Vnto my freend to shewen out my peyne, That whiloom was in richesse so hauhteyne; For to be ded, I dar for shamfastnesse; Nat shewe a poynt to hym of my distresse.” 94 And eek, that it was somwhat late, Whan he was entryd in-to that cite, Hym liked nat to knocken at the gate And nam[e]ly in so poore degre; And it was nyht: therfor he lefte be, List of his freend he were anoon refusyd As man vnknowe or for som spye accusyd. 95 In-to a temple foundid by dayes olde He is i-entryd, a place al desolat, And leyd hym doun by the wallys colde, So weyk, so wery, forwandryd and for-mat. O pompe emporisshyd, whilom so elat! Take heed, ye ryche, of what estat ye bee; For in this marchaunt your myrour ye may see. 96 How many a man hath Fortune assayled, With sleihte i-cast, whan he best wende ha stonde, Her habiriownys of steel also vnmayled! For al her trust she nolde the lasse wonde To pleye this pleye bothe with free and bonde. For who stood evir yit in surete, That in som siht infect was his degre? 97 For by exaumplys nature doth declare, Which is of God mynystir and vikeer; Withoute tonge she biddith vs beware By thylke sterrys, that shynen briht and cleer, Which by her concours and mevyng circuleer, In her discens westyng vndir wavys Vs to enfourmen by chaungyng of hir lawys. 98 And fewe of hem alway to vs appeere, But yif it be the bere briht and sheene In thilke plow, that Arthow doth it steere; For yit Boetes, that twynkelith wondir keene, Somwhile is dym, that men may nat hym seene; Eek Lucifeer, at morowhil prymycere, By nyht hym hidith vndir our empeere. 99 The day doth passe of vanite and glorye, And nyht approchith, whan Titan is gon doun. But who list wynne the palme by victorye, The world to venquyssh ful of elacioun, Lat hym despise as a chaunpioun Al erthly lustys, that shynen but in dreede, And of this marchaunt evir among tak heede. 100 Evir entirmedlyd is merthe and heuynesse, Now liht, now soory; now ioiful, now in woo; Now cleer aloffte, now lowe in dirk[e]nesse, As Iubiter hath couchyd tonnes too Withyne his ceeleer, platly and no moo: That oon is ful of ioye and gladnesse That othir ful of sorwe and bittirnesse. 101 Who that wil entren to tamen of the sweete, He mvst as weel taken his aventure To taste in bittir, or he the vessel leete, And bothe ilich of strong herte endure; He may nat clense the thykke from the pure: Fo[r], who that wil swetnesse first abroche, He mot be war, or bittir wol approche. 102 Of thes too i-dronken at the fulle Hath this marchaunt, that I of spake erwhyle; The laste beuere so maad his hed to dulle, That he ne lest but litil lawh or smyle; Expert he was bothe of trust and guyle: For, wher that he his beddyng whilom chees, Slept on the ground now nakyd herberwelees. 103 And whil that he lay sleepyng in this wise, An hap befel of too men in the toun, Betwix the which a contek gan to ryse Riht ther besyde with gret[e] noyse and soun: That oon his felawe hath slayn and bore doun Vndir the temple, wher as this marchaunt lay, And lefft hym ther and fled anoon his way. 104 The toun was reised with rvmour riht anoon And to the temple faste gonne renne; Now heer, now ther, ful swyft[e]ly they goon To taken hym, that hadde wrouht this synne Tyl atte laste they souhte han hym withynne And with the noyse, as they gonne in threste, The poore marchaunt abrayd out of his reste. 105 Riht sor astonyd, palen gan his hewe, Whan they hym asken, what mystir man he were, Or yif that he thomycide knewe, That hadde slayn the man, “that liggith there.” And he anoon withouten dreed or fere Seyde: “Certeynly, thouh ye me hange and drawe, No wiht but I hath this man i-slawe.” 106 His covetise was to ha be ded, That he by deth hys myserye myht fyne; His woo heeng on hym heuyere than led, And pouerte did hym so moche pyne He wolde, that deth had leyd hook and lyne Tacacchyd hym in to his bittir las: Therfor on hym he took this hih trespas. 107 “O Deth, desyred in aduersite, Whan thu art callyd, why nylt thu wrecchys heere? And art so reedy in felicite To come to them, that the nothyng desire? O com now, Deth, and maak of me thy feere,” This marchaunt crieth in his wooful herte: So ful he was of inward peynes smerte. 108 Anoon he was i-taken and i-bounde And cast in prisoun tyl on the nexte morwe, And than i-taken and brouht, as they hym founde, Afforn the iustice; for no man wold hym borwe. To seen a fyn he hopith of his sorwe; For-dempt he was thoruh his owne speche By iugement to han for deth the wreche. 109 And than, as faste as he to deth was lad, His oold[e] freend happyd forby passe, The which beheeld hym with cheer demvre &amp; sad And kneuh the feturys and signes of his face. And anoon he prayeth leyseer to hym and space For to been herd of hem in pacience And stynt a whyle to yive hym audience. 110 “Sires,” he seith, “so it nat yow displese, This man is dampned so ful of innocence, And gilt[e]les ye don hym this disese; For I my silf haue wrouht this gret offence: To me it fallith tencurren the sentence Of deth, the trouthe weel to founde; For with myn hand I gaff his dedly wounde!” 111 His herte was meevyd of oold naturesse To save his freend and for hym for to deye; And he was hent anoon and pullyd by duresse, With swre arrest they handys on hym leye, And al her lust meekly he did obeye; To-fore the iuge he was i-lad and drawe, Wher he was dampned by concours of the lawe. 112 Thoo was he lad with weepyng and pite, Toward his deth, of many hym besyde. His poore freend was loos at liberte, Which thouhte for woo deth thoruh his herte glyde; Whyls in the prees the verray homycide, That sothfastly that deede hadde i-wrouht, Spak to hym-sylf thus in his owne thouht: 113 “Allas, myn herte, hard as the dyamaunt, How maist thu suffre this cruelte [to] seen! Allas, thoruh remors why ne were I repentaunt The southfast trouthe to be confessyd cleen? Allas, this wrong! how may I thus susteen To see afore me vngilte thus i-take And lad to dethward oonly for my sake? 114 “O rihtwys God, to whom ech pryuyte Is pleyn and open to Thy magnyficence, O Lord, that knowyst myn hyd iniquite: Beholdyng al, O Sonne of Sapience, Ne take no vengaunce of myn hih offence, That I so longe concelyd haue the trouthe; But of Thy mercy, Lord, haue on me routhe. 115 “For weel I wot, that of Thy rihtwysnesse Thu mvst me punysshen at Thy iugement, And thouh Thu suffre a while in esynesse, Blood wil haue wreche, that wrongfully is spent. O blood vngilte, O blood so innocent, How canst thu gon to deth and nat compleyne, To wreke the afftir on me with cruel peyne? 116 “To the hih God, eternal in His see, Blood crieth out, that is i-shad in wronge, And seith: ‘O Lord, whan wilt Thu vengyd bee Vpon our deth? why bydist Thu so longe?’ Of innocentys this is the noote and songe; Wherfor I wol, whil I haue liff and space, The sothe be-knowe, and put me in Thy grace. 117 “It is to moche, that I haue slayn oon; And, but I speke, toward is anothir, The which is domb and stille as ony stoon, For verray love for to save his brothir: Everych is reedy to fonge deth for othir. Now wyl I goon and pleynly me confesse And for my gilt receyven the redresse.” 118 With open mouth lowde he gan to crye: “O ye disceyved peeple by errour! That innocent, allas, why shal he dye, Which nevir ne was his lyve trespasour? Turneth ageyn and let be this clamour And let to me her doom been hool reserved: For I am he, that hath the deth disserved. 119 “Let hym go loos, sith he of gilt is fre: It is my silf, that hath the deede i-do. Why wyl ye erren and punysshen verite And let falsnesse at his large go?” The peeple of this gan for to wondren tho, And eek the iustices, of this sodeyn chaunce, That alle here wittis wer hangid in ballaunce. 120 Yit nevirtheles thus they [haue] i-wrouhte: The ffirste the[i] vnbounde and this othir take, And by assent hem everychon i-brouhte Tofore the kyng and ther a processe make, How ech of thes hath don for othrys sake, And pray[e]n hym good iuge for to bee To fynde a wey the trouthe for to see. 121 This worthy kyng to serchyn out the riht Shewith hym-silff bothe wys and eek tretable, And made mercy to goon afforn his myht, Shapyng a mene ful iust and resonable: To alle thre he shewyd hym merciable; Of al the crym, withyne woordys fewe, Pardoun he grauntith, so they the trouthe shewe. 122 Of al the cas they haue no poynt i-sparyd (First of her ffrenship, ioye and adversite), But woord by woord the stoory hool declaryd: Bothe of thes tweyne the love and vnyte— Ye han that herd, ye gete no mor of me,— And how the thrydde hadde a conscience, For his trespace so dampned innocence. 123 With gret merveile they wondryn on this thyng, To seen in frenship so hool affeccioun, And specially this wise, worthy kyng Gan wisshe of herte, that thoruh his regioun Were ful affermyd an obligacioun Off such enteernesse fro man to man aboute: Off tresoun than ful litil wer to doute. 124 Ful hard it were tacomplisshen his desyr Or in his rewm[e] such a bargeyn dryve: The aeyer infect, the wedir is nat cleer Ne nevir ne shal, whil tresoun is so ryve; For now of trowthe no man can contryve A verray seel or thenpreent i-grave Withoute a label his armes hool to save. 125 But, whan thys kyng hath thus doon hem grace, He let hem goo at her eleccioun, And he of Baldac hat[h] lad hoom to his place His poore freend with gret processioun. He rayeth hym newe with good affeccioun And seide: “Freend, your pensiffheed asswage And for pouert ne beeth no more in rage. 126 “But here anoon, as ferre as it may laste, Of al my good halvendeel is youre: I wyl, that it departyd be as faste At your devise your pouert to socoure; For our frenship shal every sesoun floure, And in short tyme, I telle it you in pleyn, Ye shul to richesse restooryd be ageyn. 127 “And than at erst avised ye may telle, Vnto your contre whedir ye wil returne Or heer with me al your lyff[e] dwelle: The choys is your; look no more ye moorne!

Bodley Laud Misc. 683, leaves 65–78.] Here gynneth the lyff off Guy of Warwyk. 1 Fro Cristis birthe complet nyne hundrid yeer, Twenty and seuene, by computacioun, Kyng Ethelstan, as seith the Cronycleer, Regnyng that tyme in Brutys Albyoun,— Duryng also the persecucyoun Of them of Denmark, wich with myhty hond Rod, brente, and slouh, made noon excepcioun, By cruel force, thorugh out al this lond; 2 Spared nouther hih nor louh degre, Chirchis, collegis, but that they bete hem doun; Myhty castellis, and euery greet cyte In ther ffurie, by ffals oppressioun, On-to the boundys of Wynchestre toun, With suerd &amp; feer they madyn al wast &amp; wylde; And in ther mortall persecucyoun Spared nat women greet with chylde: 3 In this brennyng, ffurious cruelte, To Denmark pryncis, pompous &amp; elat, Lyk woode lyouns, void of all pite, Did no favour to louh nor hih estaat. Allas! this lond stood so dysconsolaat, Froward Fortune hath at hem so dysdeyned, Mars &amp; Mercurie wer with hem at debaat, That bothe þe kyng and pryncis wer distreyned 4 By froward force to take hem to the fflyght, Thes Danyssh pryncis ageyn hem wer so wood; On hih hilles ther ffyres gaff suych lyght, Fortune of werre in suych disioynt tho stood, The peple robbed and spoiled of ther good, For verray dreed of colour ded and pale, Whan the stremys ran doun of red blood Lyk a greet ryver fro mounteyns to þe vale. 5 Paraventure for sum old trespace, As is remembrid of antyquyte, Of o persone hap, ffortune, and grace Myhte be with-drawe, in cronycles ye may see; Reed how þe myhty ffamous Iosue Was put a-bak thre dayes in batayll, The theffte of Nachor made Israell to ffle Out of the ffeld, and in ther conquest faile. 6 Thus by the pryde and veyn ambycioun And cruel ffurie of thes pryncis tweyne This rewm almost brouht to destruccyoun, The swerd of Bellona gan at hem so disdeyne, Lordis wer pensiff, þe porail gan compleyne; Oon of thes tirauntys, callid Anelaphus, And as myn auctour remembreth in serteyn, The tother was named Genaphelus. 7 This myscheff, wers than strok of pestilence, God with his punsshyng is ffounde mercyable; Suerd of a tyraunt punssheth with vyolence, With ffurious hand mortall and vengable; Wher ffolk repente, the Lord is ay tretable, That sit above, wich halt all in his hond, But thes tirauntys, to sheden blood most able, With suerd &amp; flawme troubled al this lond. 8 God ffor synne, by record of Scripture, Hath chastysed many a greet cyte, And suffred hem gret myschef to endure, Record Ierusalem, record on Nynyvee, Paris in Fraunce hath had his part, parde, For leccherie and veyn ambucyoun; Palpable examples, at eye men may see, Of Rome, Cartage, and of Troie toun. 9 This mater offte hath been exempleffyed, For lak of wisdam and of good consayll, That peplys hertys wer nat ffull applyed To sue vertu for ther owne avayll; Wynd of glad Fortune bleuh nat in ther saill, For ther dismeritees, God punshed hem of right, Outrage &amp; vices hath vengaunce at his tayll. Thouh kyng Ethelstan was a manly knyght, 10 Cruell Danys Inglyssh blood to scheede, Ther swerd was wheet, &amp; ther ffyres lyght; ?it in cronycle, at leyser who lyst reede, Kyng Ethelstan was a ffull noble knyght, Though for a tyme eclypsed was his lyght; Of his noblesse and royall mageste, The hand of God stood alway in his myght To chaunge his trouble in-to prosperyte. 11 The sonne is hatter affter sharpe schours, The glade morwe ffolweth the dirke nyght, Affter wynter cometh May with fresshe fflours, And affter mystys Phebus schyneth bright, Affter trouble hertys be maad lyght;— And, to conclude lyk as I began, God lyst to caste his mercyable syght Vpon his knyght, the fforseid Ethelstan. 12 In this mater fforther to procede, Constreynt of werre and gret aduersyte, Made hym to drawe, in cronycle as I reede, With alle his lordis of hih and louhe degre, To haue a counsayll at Wynchestre the cyte, Som remedye in all haste to provyde Ageyn the malys and ffurious cruelte Wrouht by the Danys in ther marcyal pride. 13 Off al the lond gadryd were the statys, Remedye to schapen in this mateere, Pryncys, barouns, bysshopis and prelatys, In that cyte assembled wern in ffeere, Hap and ffortune shewyd hem heuy cheere, Ther hope turned to dysesperaunce, Knyghthood of armes had lost the maneere, So destitute they were of spere and launce. 14 In that party was no remedye, Redres to ffynde, nor consolacyoun, Mars set a-bak all ther chevalrye, Thus stood the lond in desolacyoun, Strong wer the Danys, proud by ambucioun: Kyng Ethelstan, by constreynt and distresse, Held with his lordis a counsayll in that toun To ffynde a mene his myschef to redresse; 15 By grace of God how this myht ben amendyd Recure to ffynde of ther aduersyte. Breeffly to telle, they were thus condescendyd, Benbassatrie or mene of som tretee, Streyghtly driven off necessyte, The kyng of Denmark with homage for to queme: Or vnder tribute to haue this liberte, As a soget reioysshe his dyademe; 16 Or ellis pleynly of partyes covenaunt Kyng Ethelstan for hym to ffynde a knyght With Colybrond of Denmark the Geaunt, Day assigned, to entre with hym in ffyght, For to darreyne atween hem to the right, Who shal reioisshe, with strong and myhty hond, To holde a septre, by manhood and by myght, And haue poscessioun in quyete of this lond. 17 The kyng, the lordis, beyng there present, Withoute respight, or loud dylacioun, To yeve answere of ther ffynall entent, How they list quyten hem, for short conclusioun: Outher to make a resygnacyoun Of septre &amp; crowne, outher to ffynde a knyht, As I seyde erst, to be ther champioun, Geyn Colybrond, to entryn in-to ffight. 18 The Denmark dukis, of malys importable, Wood and wylful in ther marcyal rage, In outher wise lyst nat be tretable, Requyred in haste, ben bassat or massage, To haue answere or pleggis for hostage, Of this convencioun relacioun to sende How they caste hem to puttyn in morgage The lyff of tweyne to make a fynal ende. 19 This apoyntement so streitly was forth lad, Of ffurious haste they wolde haue no delay, Kyng Ethelstan so hard[e] was be-stad, And alle his pryncis put in gret affray; Affore Wynchestre the proude dukis lay, The kyng withinne, astoned in his mende, And weel þe more, be-cause he knew no way In his dyffence a champioun to ffynde. 20 Knew no bet mene, as in this mateer, Redres to ffynde, to resoun accordyng, Than by assent to taken hym to prayeer, He and his lordis, to wakyng and ffastyng, Pore and riche, with-oute more tarying; Alle attonys, as they wern off degre, With salte teris, resembled in ther wepyng, By penaunce doyng, to folk of Nynyvee. 21 From hih estatys doun to the porayll, Of alle degrees ffounde was no wyght To vnderfonge themprise of this batayll, Ageyn the Geaunt of Denmark ffor to ffight: Herald of Harderne, þe noble famous knyht, Callid in his tyme, of prowesse nyh and ferre, Fader in armes, in euery manhis sight; Next Guy of Warwyk, of manhood lodesterre— 22 This seide Herald beyng tho absent, Out of this rewm to seke the sone of Guy, Callid Raynbourne, in contrees adiacent, And alle þe provyncis that stoode faste by, Wich in yong age was stole traytourly, By straunge marchauntis ongoodly lad away, Felyce, his moder, wepyng tendirly, For his absence compleynyng nyht and day. 23 Born by dyscent to ben hir ffadris hayr, Hir yonge sone Raynborne to succede, In hir tyme was holde noon so ffayr, Callid the example of trouthe and womanhede; Rowand, hir ffader, for noblesse and manheede, Erl of Warwyk, named oon the beste knyht That was tho dayes, in story as I reede, But he, allas! fflouryng in hys myght 24 Paide his dette of deth on-to nature, By Parcas sustren was sponne his lyves threede. And, as the story remembreth by scripture, Whan that Felyce conseyved hadde in deede, By [this] seyde Guy, sone affter, as I reede, He lyk a pilgrym endewed with all vertu The nexte morwe chaunged hath his weede, And spedde hym forth for love of Crist Ihesu; 25 Forsook the world, onknowe to euery wight, Of hih perfeccyoun to leven in penaunce, Lefft wyff and kyn, and bekam Goddis knyght, Whom for to serve was set all his plesaunce, Content with lytel, Crist was his suffysaunce, In wordly pompe he lyst not to soiourne.— Callyng ageyn on-to remembraunce Kyng Ethelstan, my penne I wyll retourne, 26 As I began, in ordre to proceede, Of his compleynt to make mencyoun: Not clad in purpil, but chaunged hath his weede, Blak for mornyng and desolacyoun, Be-cause there was in all his regyoun Founde no persone his quarell to dyffende; To God above seyde this orysoun, Bespreynt with teris, his grace doun to sende: 27 “O Lord,” quod he, “of moost magnyfycence, Cast doun Thyn erys vn-to my prayeere! Remembre nat vp-on my greet offence But fro my synnes turne a-way Thy cheere, Disespeired, stondyng in doubyll were, To lese my kyngdam, septre, and regalye, But medyacioun of Thy Moder deere Be gracious mene to saue my partye. 28 “My feith, myn hope, my trust, myn affyaunce All hoolly restith in Thy proteccyoun; My sheeld, my sheltroun, my suerd &amp; eek my launce Be blont and feble, my power is bore doun; But grace with mercy list be my champioun, Þorgh Þi support my foon shal me encombre!” —While Ethelstan seyde this orysoun, Or he was war, he ffyll in-to a slombre. 29 For wach and trouble lay in an agonye, Devoutly knelyng by his beddys syde; The Lord above, wich can no man denye That asketh grace, with meeknesse void of pride, For His servaunt lyst gracyously provyde, Which of His goodnesse sente an aungel doun, Bad hym nat dreede, but set al ffeer a-syde, Wich of His mercy had herd his orysoun. 30 Toward the kyng cast His look benygne, Bad hym truste al hoolly in His grace, By a tookene and an entyeer-signe, Which shal be shewed to hym in riht short space. Of sleep a-dawed, the kyng lefft vp his fface, Marked euerythyng, and prudently took heede To whom the angel his heuynesse tenchase, These wordis hadde, in story as I reede: 31 “From the voide al dyspeir and dreede, Whan Aurora shewith hir pale light, To-morwen erly arys and take good heede, For Crist Ihesu of Hys gracyous myght To thy requeste hath cast doun His sight. Trust vp-on Hym, and in þi trust be stable, He shall conserve of equyte and ryght Thy roiall tytle, ffor He ys mercyable. 32 “At Phebus vpriste set no lenger date, Whan silver deuh doth on the fflours ffleete, Make thy passage toward the north gate, Or that the sonne with his ffervent heete, Hath on the levys dryed vp the weete; Abide there meekly, and God shal to the sende, Fyrst among pore a pilgrym thou shalt meete, Entrete hym goodly, thy quarell to dyffende. 33 “Clad as a pilgrym in a brood sclaveyn, Old and forgrowe amongys the porayll, Marke hym weell, and be riht weell serteyn, At thy requeste that he schall nat ffayll To accomplysshe manly thy batayll.

Neuly reioisshed out off all hevynesse With too bisshopis, as maad ys mencyoun, And erlis tweyne, forth he gan hym dresse; 35 Thankyng the Lord of His benygne graunt, As he was bounde, of humble affeccyoun, With his bisshopis and erlys exspectaunt, At thilke party northward of the toun, Lyk as the aungell, for short conclusioun, Had told the hour on-to the kyng but late, Whan poore ffolk, ffor sustentacyoun, Hadde in costom to entren at the gate. 36 As the cronycle breeffly doth compile, Vnto purpos maketh rehersayll, Of Iohn Baptyst affore in the vygyle, How Guy of Warwik maad his arryvaylle At Portysmouth, myn auctour wil nat ffayle, In his writyng assignyng hour and tyme, By grace of God, wich may most avaylle, Tellith how Guy evene at the hour of pryme, 37 Whan briht Phebus, with his gold-tressed bemys, On hillis hih gan shewe his hevenly lyght, Erly on morwe, and with his hoote stremys Dried vp the deuh as perlis siluer bright, Whan seide Guy, the noble famous knyght, Repeired was from his long pylgrymage, Fro Portysmouth took his weye right, To Wynchestre holdyng his vyage. 38 By grace of God I deeme trew[e]ly Guy was hom sent in-to thys regyoun, Here taccomplisshe, in knyghthood ffynally, The laste empryse of his hih renoun, He ffor to be the kyngys champioun, Onknowe of alle; but whan he cam to lond, To hym was maad pleyn relacyoun Of his requestis, how it did[e] stond. 39 They told hym firste in ordre ceryously, Harald Harderne, that was so good a knyht, Was goon to seke the sone off Guy, Gretly desired of euery maner wight, Wich by discent was born of verray riht By tytle of Felyce, famous in womanhede, At his repair, with grace of Cristis myght, Erl of Warwyk iustly to succede. 40 They told hym also of the grete stryff, Tween them of Denmark &amp; Ethelstan þe kyng, And how that Rowand, ffader to hys wyff, Old erl of Warwik, ful notable of levyng, Was ded also;—and Guy herd euery thyng, Of hih prudence kept hym-silff clos, Lyk a pilgrym his leve there takyng, Goth to Wynchestre anoon as he aroos. 41 Guy took his loggyng, whan it drouh to nyht, With pore men at an old hospytall, Wery of travayl, onknowe to euery wight, Too hundrid pas withoute the north wall, Where stondeth now a menstre ful roiall. The nexte morwe, anoon as Guy a-wook, God was his guyde, in especyall, Mong pore men, the riht[e] weie he took 42 To the north gate, as grace did hym guye, By resemblaunce, so entryng in-to toun As Dauid whilom cam ageyn Golye To helpen Saul, by grace of God sent doun; So for reffuge and ffor savacyoun, Bothe of the kyng and of al this lond, Guy was provided to be ther champioun Ageyn the pompe off proude Colybrond. 43 By his habite and his pylgrym weede, Thilke tyme clad in a round sclaveyn, Of whos array, whan the kyng took heede, Sauh Goddis promys was nat maad in veyn, Took vp his herte, and knew riht weel serteyn, God faileth neuer His frend on see nor lond, With wepyng teris his chekis spreynt lik reyn, For verray gladnesse he took Guy by þe hond. 44 Besekyng hym, in moost louly wyse, With sobbyng cheer that routhe was to see, To vnderfonge this knyhtly hih empryse; For Goddys sake, and mercyfull pyte, To do socour in this necessyte; In his dyffence that he wyll nat ffayll, Geyn Colybrond his champioun for to be For his party darreyne the batayll. 45 Guy, wonder sad of look and of vysage, Feynt and wery, and dulled of travayll, Made his excuse that he was ffalle in age, And out of ews more to be clad in mayll. “My wil,” quod he, “yif it myhte avayll, The cruell ire of Danys to appeese, For comoun profit, good wil shal nat ffayll, My lyf iuparte to set thys lond in ese.” 46 The kyng, the lordys, made greet instaunce To this pylgrym with language and prayere; Guy, for to doon vnto the kyng plesaunce For Ihesus sake, and for His Moder deere, Ys condescendyd, lyk as ye schall heere, With Goddys grace, affter the covenaunt, As the convencyoun iustly doth requere, At place assigned to mete the Geaunt. 47 Off this empryse was maad no long delay, This convencyoun pleynly to darreyne, Tyme set of Iule vp-on the xij. day, Place assigned, and meetyng of thes tweyne, The accord rehersed, the statute, and the peyne, Doubylnesse and ffraude set a-syde, As the partyes were boundyn in serteyn, For short conclusioun ther-by to a-byde. 48 Withoute the gate, remembred as I reede, The place callyd of antyquyte, In Inglyssh tonge named Hyde Meede, Or ellis Denmark, nat fer from the Cyte: Meetyng togedre there men myghte see Terryble strokys lyk the dent of thonder, Sparklys out off ther harneys fflee, That to be-holde, it was a verray wonder. 49 The old pylgrym quyt hym lyk a knyght, Spared nat the Geaunt to assaylle, On his lefft shulder smet at hym with suych myht Vndir the bordour of his aventayll A streem of blood gan by his sydes rayll; The Geaunt wood, this hydous Colybrond, Thoughte it sholde gretly hym avayll That Guyes suerd was broke out of his hond. 50 Whan Danys sauh Guy had lost his suerd, They cauhte a maner consolacyoun; Guy, lyk a knyght in herte nat afferd, Requered manly of the champioun Sith he of wepnys hadde so gret foysoun To graunte hym oon, that hour in his diffence; But Colybrond of indyngnacyoun To his requeste gaff noon audyence. 51 For he was set on malys and on wrak, To execute his purpos set on pryde, And while that he and Guy to-gedre spak, All attonys Guy sterte out a-syde, Cauhte a pollex, lyst no lenger byde, Smette the Geaunt evene in the firste wounde, Made his strok so myghtyly to glyde That his lefft arme and shuldir ffyll to grounde; 52 With wich strok the Geaunt Colybrond, Al his armure and boody was maad reed, Stoupyng a-syde, gan reche forth his hond, To take a suerd, wherof Guy took heed. God and grace that day gaff hym suych speed, To put his name euer affter in memorie, Fleih with his ax, smet of the sturdy heed Of the Geaunt, and hadde of hym vyctorye. 53 This thyng accomplisshed by grace of Goddis hond, And by the prowesse of Guy, this noble knyght, They of Denmark, as the statute bond, Han crossed sail, and take ther weye right Toward ther cuntre, nouther glad nor light, Ther surquedye and ther pompe oppressed: Kyng Ethelstan by grace of Goddys myht, Hadde of Denmark the pompe ful repressed. 54 Ther froward pompe with meknesse was repressed, By Guy of Warwyk, as maad is mencioun,— The kyng, the clergye devoutly haue hem dressed, Pryncys, barouns and burgeis of the toun, With al the comounte; for short conclusioun, Hih and lowe, to speke in generall, Hym to conveie with proscessioun, On-to ther chirche callyd Cathedrall. 55 This seide Guy, ther knelyng on his kne, With gret meknesse made his oblacioun Of thilke ex, with wich afforn that he Hadde of Danys slayn the champioun, Wich instrument thorugh al this regyoun; Is yit callid “the ex of Colybrond,” Kept among men of relygyoun In the vestiarie, as ye shall vnderstond. 56 Whan al was doon, ther is no more to seyn, Guy in al haste caste of hys armure, Lyk a pilgrym put on his sclaveyn. The kyng ful goodly affter dyd his cure That he myhte the grace so recure Of this pilgrym to tellyn and nat spare, In secre wyse to tellyn his aventure, What was his name pleynly to declare. 57 “Certys,” quod Guy, “ye must haue me excused. Touchyng your ascyng and your petycioun, Beth nat besy, and lat no more be mused In your desire for noon occasioun. To myn excuse I haue ful greet resoun, For I shal neuer dyscure this mateer But vnder bond of a condycyoun, Assuraunce maad tween yow and me, in feere; 58 “Alle your pryncys avoided by absence, Sool be our-silff, out of this cyte, Noon but we tweyne beyng in presence, With trouthe assured that ye shal be secre, Duryng my lyf—ye gete no more of me— To no persone, I aske no more avayll, Of ffeith and oth, to hih nor louh degre, That ye shall neuer dyscure my counsayll.” 59 This thyng confermed by promys ful roiall, Passed the subbarbys and boundys of the toun, At a cros that stood ffeer ffrom the wall, Ful devoutly the pilgrym knelith doun, To sette asyde all suspecyoun. “My lord,” quod he, “Of feith with-outen blame, Your lyge man, of humble affeccyoun, Guy of Warwyk trewly is my name.” 60 The kyng, astoned, gan chaunge cher and face, And in maner gan wepyn for gladnesse, And al attonys he gan hym to enbrace In bothe his armes, of royall gentylnesse, With offte kyssyng of ffeithfull kyndenesse, With grete proffres on the tother syde Of gold, of tresour, and of gret rychesse With-inne his paleys yif he wolde abyde. 61 Alle thes profres meekly he for-sook, And to the kynges royall mageste Hym recomaundyng, anoon his weie he took. At his departyng this avouh maad he, With pitous wepyng, knelyng on his kne, Vnto the kyng in ffull humble entent: “Duryng my lyf, it may noon other bee, Schall I neuer doon of this garnement.” 62 At ther departyng was but smal langage, Sweem of ther speche made interupcyoun; The kyng goth hom,—Guy took his vyage Toward Warwyk, his castell and his toun, No man of hym hauyng suspecyoun. Where day be day Felyce, his trewe wyf, Fedde poore folk, of greet devocyoun, To praie for hir, and for hir lordys lyf— 63 Thrittene in noumbre, myn auctour writeth so. Guy at his comyng forgrowe in his vysage, Thre daies space he was oon of tho That took almesse with humble and louh corage; Thankyng the contesse, in haste took his viage Nat fer fro Warwyk, the cronycle doth expresse, Of aventure kam to an hermytage Where he fond on dwellyng in wyldirnesse. 64 To hym he drouh, besechyng hym of grace For a tyme to holde there soiour. The same hermyte with-inne a lytel space By deth is passed the ffyn of his labour; Affter whos day Guy was his successour Space of too yeer, by grace of Cryst Ihesu, Dauntyng his flessh by penaunce and rigour, Ay more and more encresyng in vertu. 65 God made him knowe the day he sholde deie, Thorugh his moost gracyous vysytacyoun, Be an angel hys spirit to conveye Affter his bodyly resolucyoun, For his merites to the hevenly mansioun; Affter he sente in haste his weddyng ryng Vn-to his wyf, of trewe affeccyoun, Praied hir come to been at his deyng. 66 And that she scholde doon hir besy cure, By a maner wyfly dyllygence, In haste ordeyne for his sepulture With no gret cost, nor with no gret dyspence. Gan haste hir faste tyl she kam in presence Where as he lay dedly and pale of fface; Bespreynt with teris, knelyng with reuerence, The dede body swownyng she did enbrace. 67 And as this notable, ffamous, worthy knyght Sente hir to seyne, eek be his massangeer, In that place to burye hym anoon right, Where as he lay afforn a smal auhteer, And that she sholde doon trewly hir deveer, For hir-silf dyspoce[n] and provyde The xv day ffolwyng, the same yeer, To be buryed ffaste be his syde. 68 Hys hooly wyf of al this thyng took heed Lyk as Guy bad, lyst no lenger tarye, To quyte hir-silf of trouthe and womanheed She was ful loth ffrom his desire to varye; Sente in al haste ffor the ordynarye, Whiche ocupied in that dyocyse; She was nat ffounde in o poynt contrarye Al thyng taccomplisshe as ye han herd devyse. 69 And this mater breefly to conclude, At his exequyes, old and yong of age, Of dyuerse statys there cam gret multytude With gret devocyoun to that hermytage; And lyk a prynce with al the surplusage, They took hym vp, and leyd hym in his grave, Ordeyned of God afforn of hih corage Ageyn the Danys thys regyoun to save. 70 Whos sowle, I hope, restith now in glorye, With hooly spiritis above the ffirmament. Felyce, his wyf, ay callyng to memorie The day approchyng of hir enterment, Afforn ordeyned in hir testament Hir sone Reynborne be tytle of hir possede, Heyr trewly born by lyneal dyscent, In the Erldam of Warwyk to succede. 71 The stok descendyng of antyquyte To Guy his ffader be tytle of mariage, Affter whos deth, of lawe and equyte, Reynborne to entre in-to his herytage. Affter al this, his mooder, of good age, Hath yolde hir dette, by deth, vn-to nature.

A Disputation between a horse, a sheepe and a goose, for superiotitie (in a later hand). 1 Controuersies, pleys &amp; discordis Attween persones, wer it too or thre, Sought out the ground bi wittnessis of recordis: This was the costom of antiquyte; Iuges wer sett that hadde auctor[i]te, The cas conceyved stondyng indifferent, Attween parties to yeue a iugement. 2 Parties assemblid of hih or lowe degre, Weren admittid to shewen in sentence Ground of her quarell; the lawe made hem fre Without excepcioun to come to audience, Bi the president comaundid first silence, Fredam yove the parties nat to spare Bi title of right ther grevis to declare. 3 Vpon this mater shortly to conclude, Nat yoor a-gon as I reherse shall, I fond to purpos a similitude Ful craftily depeyntid vpon a wall: Tweyn sitt in ther estat roiall, The hardy Leoun famous in al rewmys, Themperiall Egle pershyng the sonne bemys. 4 These wer the dreedful roiall iugis tweyn, In ther estate sittyng, I took keepe, That herde the parties bi &amp; bi compleyn, The Hoors, the Goos, &amp; the symple Sheepe.

Wher-fore, ye Iugis, I hold it for the best, Rem publicam ye must of riht preferre, Alwey consideryng that pees is bet than werre. 58 “In this mater breffly to conclude, Pees to preferre as to my devis, Bi many an old previd symylitude: Makith no delay, yeuyth to the Sheep the pris, Of oon assent, sith that ye be wis; Lat al werr &amp; striff be sett a-side, And vpon pees dooth with the Sheep a-bide.” 59 “Nay,” quod the Hors, “your request is wrong, Al thyng considerid me wer loth to erre: The Sheep is cause &amp; hath be ful long, Of newe striff &amp; of mortal werre. The circumstancis me list nat to defferre: Thi wolle was cause &amp; gret occasion Whi that the proude Duke of Burgo[uy]n 60 “Cam befor Caleis with Flemynges nat a fewe, Which yaff the sakkis &amp; sarpleres of the toun To Gaunt &amp; Brugis his fredam for to shewe, And of thi wolle hiht hem pocessioun; But his boistous baistill first was bete doun; He vnethe escapid with the liff: What but thi wolle was cause of al this striff? 61 “Wher richesse is of wolle &amp; sich good, Men drawe thidir that be rek[e]les, And soudiours that braynles been, &amp; wood, To gete baggage put hem silf in prees: Causist werre, seist thu louest pees. And yiff ther wer no werre nor bataille, Lityll or nouht gret Hors[is] shuld availe.” 62 “No,” quod the Goos, “nor my ffetheris white, Withoute werre shuld do non avauntage, Nor hookid arwis profite but a lite: To mete our e[n]myes magre ther visage, And from our enmyes to save vs from damage, Fliht of my ffetheris despite of Sheep echon, Shal vs deffende a-geyn our mortal foon.” 63 “Sothe,” quod the Hors, “as in my inward siht, Without[en] werre (be-forn as I yow told), We may nat save nor keepe [wele] our riht, Our garisons nor our castelis old. But her this Sheep rukyng in his fold, Set litill stoor of swerd or arwis keene, Whan he, in pees, may pastur on the greene. 64 “Yiff it so stood that no werre were, Lost wer the craft of these armoreres. What shuld availe pollex, swerd or spere, Or these daggars wrouht bi coteleres, Bowes, crosbowes arwis or fletcheres?

And compleyneth on the werris sore: He seith, ‘bi werris he hath goodis lore,’ Can no recur but grutchyng &amp; disdeyn, Seith he wold fayn have pees a-geyn. 68 Thus pride &amp; richesse to conclude in a clause, Betwen thextremytes of pes &amp; pouerte, Off all debatis &amp; werre be cheeff cause; And, sith wollis bryngith in gret plente, Wher thei habounde (as folk expert may se), Than may I seyn (yiff men wole takyn keepe), Werr is brouht in al only bi the Sheep.” 69 “Her is a gentil reson of an Hors! Ouis I trowe he be fallen in a dotage, Which of madnesse bi wolle set no fors, Falsly affermeth it doth non avauntage. Vertuous plente may do no damage: Sheep berith his wolle, I told so whan I gan, Nat for hym-silf, but for profit of man. 70 “Divers comoditees that comen of the Sheep Cause no werris what men iangle or muse, As in her gilt, ye Iuges, takith keep What that I sei her innocence texcuse! Of coveitise men may falsly mysvse Her beenfetis &amp; wrongly hem attwite Of sich occasiouns wher he is nat to wite. 71 “What is the Sheep to blame in your sight Whan she is shoorn &amp; of hir flessh made bare, Thouh folk of malice for his wollis fiht? Causelees to stryve foolis wil nat spare. Wher pees restith ther is al weelfare; And sith the Sheep louyth pes of innocence, Yeuyth to his party diffynytiff sentence.” 72 The roial Egle, the Leon, of assent, Al thyng considerid rehersid heer-to-forn Of all these thre bi good avisement, Of Hors, of Goos, of Ram, with his gret horn, Sauh in re publica myht nat be for-born; Bi short sentence tavoyde al discorde, Cast a meene to sett hem at a-corde. 73 This was the meene tavoide first the stryves, And al old rancour with her hertis glade, Vse her yiftes &amp; her prerogatives To that eende which that thei wer made, War, with presu[m]pcioun her bakkis be nat lade, Vndevidid with hert[e], will &amp; thouht To doon her office as natur hath hem wrouht. 74 The Hors, bi kynde, to lyve in travayle, Goos, with his Gooslynges [to] swymme in the lake, The Sheep, whoos wolle doth so myche availe, In hir pastur grese &amp; mery make; Her comparisouns bi on assent for-sake, Al-wey remembryng how God &amp; Natur, To a good ende made euery creatur. 75 That noon [of hem] to othir shuld do no wrong, The ravenous wolf the sely lambe toppresse; And thouh oon be more than an othir strong, To the febler do no froward duresse. Al extorcioun is groundid on falsnesse; Will is no lawe whethir it be wrong or riht: Treuthe is put doun, the feeble is put to fliht. 76 Odious of old been all co[m]parisouns, And of comparisons is gendrid hatereede; All folk be nat of lik condiciouns, Nor lik disposid of thouht, wil, or deede; But this fable which that ye now reede, Contreued was that who that hath grettest part Off vertuous yiftis shold with his freend depart. 77 Thus all vertues alloone hath nat oo man: That oon lakkith God hath yove a-nothir: That thou canst nat parcas a-nothir can: So entircomon as brothir doth with brothir; And if charite gouerne weele the tothir, And in oo clause speke in wordis pleyn, That no man shold of othir ha disdeyn. [Amor uincit omnia] The Auctour makith a lenvoie vpon all the mateer be-fore said. 78 Off this fable conceivith the sentence; At good leiser doth the mateer see, Which importith gret intelligence Yiff ye list take the moralite Profitable to euery comounte, Which includith in many sondry wise, No man shuld of hih nor lowe degre, For no prerogatiff his neihbore despise. 79 Som man is strong, hardi as a Leoun To bynde Beeris or Booris to oppresse, Wher-as anothir hath gret discrecioun; Som man hooly liveth in parfitnesse, A-nothir besi to gadre gret richesse: But with al this tak heed of this emprise, No man presume so hih his hornes dresse, For no prerogatiff his neihbour to despise. 80 Trappurs of gold ordeyned wer for steedis; Sheep in the pastur gresen with mekenesse, Yit of ther wollis be woven riche weedis, Of smothe doun maad pilwis for softnesse, Fethirbeddis to sleep, whan men dresse Toward Aurora agey[n] til thei arrise: Rolle vp this problem, thynk what it doth expresse: For no prerogatiffe thi neihbour nat despise. 81 The inward meenyng to-forn as it is told, The Hors is tokne of marcial noblesse With his hi belle &amp; bocis brood of gold. Estat of tirantis the poraile doth oppresse; The Woolff in ffoldis to Sheep doth duresse, Rukkyng in ffoldis for dreed dar nat arryse, Ye that han power be war in your hihnesse, For no prerogatiff, your sogettis to despise. 82 A pronostik clerkis ber wittnesse: Beth war of Phebus that erly cast his liht, Of reyn, of storme, of myste or of derknesse Shal aftir folwe longe or it be nyht; Signe of gret wyntir whan wild gees tak her fliht Like as Natur hir stoundis can devise: Lat hih nor lowe presumen of his myht, For no prerogatiff his neihbour to despise. 83 Of many strange vncouth simylitude, Poetis of old fablis have contryvid, Of Sheep, of Hors, of Gees, of bestis rude, Bi which ther wittis wer secretly apprevid, Vndir covert tyrauntis eeke reprevid Ther oppressiouns &amp; malis to chastise Bi exanplis of resoun to be mevid, For no prerogatiff poore folk to despise. 84 Fortunes cours dyversly is dressid Bi liknessis of many othir tale; Man, best, &amp; fowle &amp; fisshis been oppressid In ther natur bi female or bi male; Of grettest fissh devourid been the smale, Which in natur is a ful straunge guyse, To seen a Kokkow mordre a Nityngale, An innocent brid of hattreede to despise. 85 With this processe who that be wroht or wood, Thynges contrarie be founde in euery kynde: A cherl of berthe hatith gentil blood; It wer a monstre a-geyn natur, as I fynde, That a gret Mastyff shuld a Leoun bynde; A parlious clymbyng whan beggerrs vp arise To hih estat—merk this in your mynde— Bi fals prerogatives ther neihbours to despise. 86 Fals supplantyng clymbyng vp of foolis, Vnto chaires of wordly dygnyte, Lak of discrecioun sett iobbardis vpon stoolis, Which hath distroied many a comounte: Marcolff to sitt in Salamon-is see. What folwith aftir? Nor resoun nor iustise, Vn-iust promocioun &amp; parcialite, Bi fals prerogativis ther neihbours to despise. 87 Tweene riche &amp; poore what is the difference, Whan deth approchith in any creature, Sauff a gay tumbe ffressh of apparence? The riche is shet with colours &amp; pictur To hide his careyn stuffid with fowle ordur; The poore lith lowe aftir the comoun guyse, To techyn al proude of resoun &amp; natur, For no prerogatiff ther neihbour to despise. 88 Ther was a kyng whilom as I rede, As is remembrid of ful yore a-gon, Which cast away croune &amp; purpil weede, Bi cause that he knew nat bon fro bon, Of poore nor riche hym sempte thei wer al on, Refusid his crounne gan to aduertise: Pryncis buried in gold nor precious ston, Shuld, of no pompe, ther suggettis nat despise. 89 This thyng was doon in Alisandris tyme, Bothe autentik &amp; historiall; Bood nat til nyht, left his estat at pryme, His purpil mantil, his garnement roiall, Texemplifie in especiall To imperial power what perel is to a-rise: Whoo clymbith hihest most dreedful is his fall Beeth war, ye princis, your sogettis to despise. 90 Hih &amp; low wer maad of oo mateer; Of erthe we cam, to erthe we shal a-geyn; Thees emperours with diademys cleer, With ther victories &amp; triumphes in certeyn, In charis of gold lat hem nat disdeyn, Thouh thei, eche day, of newe hem silf disguyse. Fortune is fals, hir sonne is meynte with reyn: Beth war, ye pryncis, your suggettis to despise. 91 Hed &amp; feete been necessary bothe; Feet beryn vp all &amp; hedis shal provide; Hors, Sheep, &amp; Gees, whi shuld thei be wrothe, For ther comoditees tabreyden vpon pride? Natur hir giftis doth dyversly devide, Whoos power lastith from Cartage into Fryse: He lastith weel that wisly can a-byde, For any prerogatiff his neihbour to dispise. Conclusio. To beest &amp; foule Nature hath set a lawe: Ordeyned steedis in iustis for the knyht, In carte &amp; plouh stokkis for to drawe, Sheep in ther pastur to grese day &amp; nyht, Gees to swymme a-mong to take ther fliht; Of God &amp; kynde to take ther ffraunchise, Yeuyng exaumple that no maner wiht For no prerogatiff his neihbour shal dispise.

The Tale of the Cok, that founde a precyous stone, groundyd by Isopus, the phylosopher of Rome, that yche man shuld take in gree suche as God sent. 1 W]isdom ys more in prise, þen gold in cofers, To hem, þat haue sauour in lettrure. Olde examples of prudent philosophers Moche auaylyd to folke þat dyd her cure To serche out lykenes in nature, In whyche men myght conceue &amp; clerely see Notable sentence of gret moralyte. 2 Vnto purpos þe poete laureate Callyd Isopus dyd hym occupy Whylom in Rome to plese þe senate, Fonde out fables, þat men myght hem apply To sondry matyrs, yche man for hys party, Aftyr þeyr lust, to conclude in substaunce, Dyuerse moralytees set out to þeyr plesaunce. 3 Som of foules, of bestis and of fyssh, Thys Isopus founde out exsample pleyne. Where syluer fayleþ, in a pewter dyssh Ryall dentees byn oft tymes seyne, And semblably poetes, in certeyne, In fables rude includyd gret prudence And moralytees full notable of sentence. 4 Vnder blak erþe byn precious stones founde, Ryche saphyres &amp; charbuncles full ryall, And, who þat myneþ downe lowe in þe grounde, Of gold &amp; syluer groweþ þe mynerall; Perlys whyte, clere &amp; orientall Ben oft founde in muscle shellys blake, And out of fables gret wysdom men may take. 5 For whyche I cast to folow þys poete And hys fables in Englyssh to translate, And, þough I haue no rethoryk swete, Haue me excusyd: I was born in Lydgate; Of Tullius gardeyn I passyd nat þe gate, And cause, why: I had no lycence There to gadyr floures of elloquence. 6 Yet, as I can, forþe I woll procede In þys labour &amp; my style dresse To do plesaunce to þeym, þat shall hit rede, Requiryng hem of verrey gentylnes Of her grace to rewe on my rudenes, Thys compilacion for to take at gree, Whyche theym to plese translatyd was by me. 7 And, yef I fall bycause of ignoraunce, That I erre in my translacion, Lowly of hert &amp; feyþfull obeysaunce, I me submyt to þeyr correccion, Of hem, þat haue more clere inspeccion In matyrs, þat touche poetry, Me to reforme þat þey nat deny. 8 And, as myn auctor doþe at þe cok begyn, I cast me to folow hym in substaunce, Fro þe trouþe in sentence nat to twyn, As God and grace woll yeue me suffysaunce, Compyle þys lybell for a remembraunce: To the reders hereaftyr may be founde The thanke þerof fully to rebounde. 9 The Cok of kynde haþe a crest rede Shape lyke a crowne, token of gret noblesse, By whyche he haþe, whyle hit stont on hys hede, As clerkis seyn, corage &amp; hardynes, And of hys berde melancolyk felnes: Aboute hys nek by mercyall apparayll Nature haþe yeue hym a stately auentayll. 10 Thys hardy foule with brest &amp; voyce so clere Most trewly kepeþ þe tydes of þe nyght, Of custom namyd comon astrologere In throwpes smale to make þeyr hertis lyght; With spores sharpe enarmyd for to fyght Lyke a champion iustly doþe attende, As a proud capten, hys broode for to defende; 11 Beteþ hys wyngis, aforn or he do syng B[i]t sluggy hertis out of þeyr slepe to wake, When Lucyfer toward þe dawnyng Lawgheth in þe oryent &amp; haþe þe west forsake To chase awey þe myghty clowdys blake: Towarde Aurora þys foule, who takeþ kepe, Byddyþ folk ayene awake out of þeyr slepe, 12 Whos waker callyng þryes tolde in nombre With treble laudes youe to þe Trinite, Slouþe auoydyng, clepeþ folk out of þer slombre (Good hope repeyreþ to all, þat heuy bee), Comforteþ þe seke in hys infirmite, Causeþ merchauntis &amp; pylgryms to be glad, The þeuys swerde hyd vndyr þe shad. 13 Callyd þe prophete of ioy &amp; all gladnes, Embassiatour of Phebus fyry lyght, Whyche put awey by musicall swetnes The vgly blaknes of þe derk[e] nyght; For whyche me semeth, me shuld of dew[e] ryght For .iij. causes preferre þys foule among, For waker kepyng, for hardynes &amp; song. 14 Thys foule ys waker ayen þe vyce of slouþe, In vertu strong &amp; hardy as a lyon, Stable as a geaunt, opon a grounde of trouþe, Ayene all vyces þe morall champion, And with þe entewnes of hys melodious soun He yeueþ ensample, as he hys voyce doþ reyse, Howe day &amp; nyght we the lord shall preyse. 15 And, for because hys brest ys strong &amp; cleere And on hys tipto dysposeþ for to syng, He ys of poettis callyd Chaunceleer. And, as myn auctour remembreþ by wrytyng, Whylom þys foule in a glad mornyng Reioysyd hym ayene the son[ne] shene With all hys flok to walke opon a grene. 16 He was furst besy for to breke hys faste, With hys wyues about hym euerychone, On a small donghyll to fynde a good repaste Gan scrape &amp; sporne &amp; fast about[e] gone. Hyd in þe dong hyll he fonde a iacynct stone, Yet hys labour &amp; hys besy cure Was for nat elles, but for hys pasture. 17 He yaue ensample, whyche gretly may auayle, As he was oonly taught by nature, To auoyde slouþe by dylygent trauayle, By honest labour hys lyuelood to procure. For, who woll þryue, labour must endure; For idylnes &amp; froward negligence Makeþ sturdy beggars for lak of þeyr dyspence. 18 Losengowres, þat fele hem strong ynough, Whyche haue sauour in slouþe &amp; slogardy, Haue leuer to beg, þen go at þe plough, Dyche or delue, þeymsylf to occupy. Thus idylnes[se] causeþ rob[e]ry In vacant pepyll, þat to and fro dyd wende: For þeft arestyd at Tyburn make an ende. 19 They be no men, but folkis bestiall, Voyde of reson oonly for lak of grace, Whyche ete &amp; drynke &amp; labour nat at all. The cok was besy hys lyuelood to purchase The long day in many diuerse plase, Hym &amp; hys broode oonly to forstre, in trouþe, Suche folke rebukyng, þat lyue in slombre &amp; slouþe. 20 Vertu gynneþ at occupacion, Vyces all procede of idelnesse, Vnto þeues foundres &amp; patroun; As thryft commeþ of vertuous besynesse, So of myschyef slouth ys chief maistresse: Thys ydelnes causeþ folk in dede To waste þeyr dayes in myschief &amp; in nede. 21 With scrapyng, spornyng all þe long[e] day The cok was besy hym &amp; hys broode to fede, Founde a iacyncte, whyche in þe donghyll lay, A ryche stone &amp; a precious, as I rede; Of whyche stone when þe cok toke hede, Stynt awhyle, sodenly abrayde, And to þe ston euyn þus he sayde: 22 “Who þat knew þy nature &amp; þy kynde, All þe propurtees, whyche of the be tolde, A ieweller, yef he þe myght fynde, Wolde for þy vertues close þe in golde.

The Tale of the Wolfe and the Lambe groundyd opon Isopus, the phylosophor of Rome, ayenst raueyn &amp; tiranny. 33 R]yght as atwene turment &amp; delyces There ys in kynde a gret difference, Ryght so atwene vertues lyfe &amp; vyces There may be no iust conuenience: Malyce contrary to pure innocence, And phylosophers by wrytyng bere recorde, Twene trowþe &amp; fraude may be non acorde. 34 Atwene rancour &amp; humble pacience Ther ys in nature a gret diuision: A sely shepe make may no resistence Ageyn þe power of a strong lyon; A dwerfe to fyght with a champyon Were to febyll in a felde to endure, By lykenes agayn nature. 35 Grete pykes, þat swymme in large stewes, Smaller fysshe most felly þey deuour. Who haþe most myght, þe febler gladly sewes: The pore haþe few hys party to socour. The rauenous wolf opon þe lambe doþe lour; Of whyche Isopus in hys booke Full notably thys example he toke. 36 The lambe, þe wolf[e], contrary of nature, Euer diuerse &amp; noþyng oon þey þynke. Boþe at onys of soden auenture To a fresshe ryuer þey came downe to drynke: At þe hede spryng hy opon þe brynke Stondeþ þe wolfe, a froward beste of kynde; The sely lambe stood fer abak behynde. 37 Who þat is froward of condicion And disposyd to malyce &amp; outrage, Can sone seke &amp; fynde occasion Pyke a quarell for to do damage; And vnto purpose malycious of corage The furyos wolfe out with hys venym brake, And euyn þys vnto þe lambe he spake: 38 “Lyke þy ffadyr, þou art false &amp; double And hym resemblest of dysposicion, For he was wont my water here to trouble, To meue þe þyk, þat lay low doune: Þat I myght haue no recreacioune To drynk my fyll of water pure and clere, He was so contrary to trouble þys ryuere. 39 “And þou of malyce art com to do þe same, Sekest occasion by trobly vyolence Ayenst me &amp; makest þerof a game To fynde mater and for to do offence.” The lambe answerd with humble reuerence: “Thys may nat be; þe preef ys seyn full oft: I stond beneþe, &amp; ye stond aloft. 40 “From þe hyll þe ryuer downe dyscendeþ: For to ascende hit were ageyn nature. That I stond here hit noþyng yow offendeþ: The trowble goþe low, aboue hit ys most pure; The clere ys youres, but I must endure, Tyll ye haue dronke, and þen at erst begyn, Take, as hit falleþ, þe þyk with the þyn. 41 “I may nat chese: þe choyse to yow ys fall. Hyt were but foly for me with yow to stryue. Ye shall for me haue your desyres all: Of your ryght I wyll nat yow depryue.” But þe wolfe a cause gan contryue Ageyn the lambe of naturall haterede, Seyd vnto hym quakyng in hys drede: 42 “Thy feynyd speche flatteryng &amp; benygne, I see hit well in myn inward syght, How þou dost ayene me malygne To vex me wrongfully, yef þou haddyst myght. The lawe shall part vs, whyche of vs haþ ryght.” But he no lenger on þe lawe abood, Deuouryd þe lambe &amp; aftyr soke hys blood. 43 The lambe was sleyn, for he seyd soþ. Thus was law tornyd to rauyne, Dome execute by þe wolfis tothe; By whyche lawe Naboth lost hys vyne, iii?. Regum viij?. ca?. Whylom commaundyd by law, whyche ys dyuyne, No rauenous beste (þe Byble doþ deuyse) Shuld be offred to God in sacryfyse. 44 Herdys be rekles þe lambe for to defende, Take noon hede on theyr flock to tary; Ther hounde ys muett, whyche þat shuld attende To kepe þe wache fro wolues most contrary; Fewe sheperdys &amp; many mercynary, Pauci pastores te mercenarii multi. That falsly entre, as Iohns gospell tolde, By þe wyndow into Crystis folde. 45 The lambe ys clyppyd, chese and mylke ys peysyd, On felle &amp; flesshe ys set a certayn pryse, For tylþe of lond þe dong ys also preysyd, Noþyng foryete (sheperdys be so wyse): The beest ys spoylyd &amp; nat without avyse. The wolf haþ so ferre þe lambe purchasyd, That he ys deuouryd &amp; haþ noþyng trespasyd. 46 The ram in Colches bare a flees of golde; Therof he was dyspoylyd by Iason, The body left hoole, lyke as hit ys tolde. But shepe þese dayes be spoylyd to þe bon; For þer be wolfes many mo þen oon, That clyp lamborn at sessions &amp; at shyres Bare to þe bone, &amp; yet þey haue no sheres. 47 The sely lambe ys spoylyd to þe bones, The wolf goþ fre, wheþer hit be ryght or wrong. When [a] iorrour haþe caught sauour ones To be forsworn, custom makeþ hym strong. Si dedero ys now so mery a song, Haþ founde a practyk by lawe to make a preef To hang a trew man &amp; saue an errant theef. 48 With empty hande men may noon hawkis lewre Nor cache a iorrour, but yef he yeue hym mede. The pore pleteþ: what ys hys auenture? Voyde purse causeþ he may nat spede. The lambe put bak, þe wolf þe daunce doþ lede. Dyfference atwene þese bestis tweyne Causyd Isopus þys tale for to feyne. Conclusio. 49 The wolfe ys lykenyd to folkys rauenous, The sely lambe resembleþ þe porayle; The wolfe ys gredy, fell, cruell, dyspituous, The lambe content with grasse for hys vytayle. The[i] dey[e] boþe: þe wolfe may nat auayle, Be hit for houndis caren most corumpable, The lambe vp seruyd at þe kyngis table. 50 As men deserue, þey receue þeyr guerdon. On repentaunte þe tyraunt goþ to hell. The pore man with small possession Vertuosly doþ in þe erþe dwell, Content with lytell doþ trewly by and sell And of hoole hert can loue God &amp; drede; When he goþ hens, haþe heuen to hys mede. 51 To encrese vertu and vyces to confounde Example here shewyd of gret diuersyte; By Isopus was þys fable founde, Where ys rehersyd, toforne as ye may se, The wolfis felnesse, þe lambes properte; The lambe commendyd for naturall mekenes The wolfe rebuked for rauenous felnes. Explicit. FABLE III. The Tale of the Frogge and þe Mowse foundyd by Isopus, þe philosophor, groundyd ayenst deceyte. 52 B]y a decree of Natures law, Peysyd egally þe balance of reson, Who þat cast hym deceue hys felaw, Shall of deceyte receue þe guerdon. Salary to feynyng ys simulacion.

The dorre on donghyll, þe bee on holsom floures, As þey receue, þey bryng home to theyr heue: The oon doþe damage, þe oþer doþ releue. 54 Aftyr þeyr naturall disposicions In man &amp; beste ys shewyd experyence: Som haue to vertew þeyr inclinacions, Oone to profyte, anoþer to do offence; Som man pesyble, som man doþ violence; Som man delyteþ in trouþe in hys entent, Anoþer reioyseþ to be fraudulent. 55 Who þat meneþ treson or falsnes With a pretence outward or frenshyp or frendlyhede, Face counterfete of feynyd fals gladnes, Of all enemyes suche oon ys most to drede, And Isopus to purpos, as I rede, Telleþ how a ffrosshe felle &amp; contraryouse, Dowble of entent, deceuyd haþe þe movse. 56 Of þys fable þe processe for to tell, The frosshe of custom abode at a ryuer; The mowse also soiornyd at a myll, That stood besyde from all dangere; And a morow, when Phebus shone full clere, So as þe frosshe passyd þerbesyde, The mowse besought hym goodly to abyde. 57 Lad hym vp to þe myll alofte, Shewyd hym the hoper, þe trowgh &amp; þe myll stone, On a corne sak made hym syt softe, Seyde, he shuld to dyner go anone, Leyde afore hym greynes many oone: To shewe hym of gentylnes gret fauourure The second course he brought in mele &amp; floure. 58 “See,” quoth þe mowse, “þys ys a mery lyfe. Here ys my lordshyp &amp; dominacion. I lyue here esyly out of noyse &amp; stryfe. Thys cloos all hoole ys in my subieccion. Suffisaunce ys my possessione. As I haue appetyte, I dyne late or sone; For Gyb, þe catte, haþe here noþyng to done. 59 “As mesemeþ, I am here ryght well easyd. Better ys quyete, þen troble with ryches. A poreman, þat ys with lytyll plesyd, Laboreþ truly, meneþ no falsenes And ys sequestryd fro worldly besynes, He may at nyght by many sondry preues Meryly slepe for any fere of theues. 60 “Blessyd be pouerte, þat causeþ assurance, Namely when gladnes doþ hys brydyll lede. What God sendeþ, hit ys to þeyr plesance, Thankeþ þe lorde, grogeþ for no nede. As he fyndeþ, þeron he doþ hym fede. Thus am I content here in my householde As well as Cresus was with all hys golde. 61 “Tresour of Mygdas medelyd was with drede, Broke slepes, reft hym hys libertees. The pore man slepeþ fearelese, takeþ noon hede, Who ryde or go: hys gatis opyn bee. And I suppose, noman ys more free Nor more assuryd, to myne opynyon, Then glad pouert with small possession. 62 “Salomon wryteþ, howe hit ys bet by halfe A lompe of brede with reioysyng, Then at festis to haue a rostyd calfe With heuy chere, frownyng or grogyng. Nature ys content with full lytell þyng. As men seyen &amp; reporte, at þe leste, Nat many deyntees, but good chere makeþ a feste. 63 “Where a tyraunt haþ power noon nor myght, Ys sewre abydyng vnto þe porayll. Diogenes was with hys towne as lyght, As Alysaundre with all hys apparayll. Thys lytyll mylle fynt me my vytayll: I haue þerin as gret lust and ioy, As kyng Priamus had in hys towne of Troy. 64 “The poreman mery in hys cotage, As ys þe merchaunt in hys stuffyd house; The plowman glad with bacon &amp; potage, As in þeyr paleyse byn prynces gloriouse. And, þough þat I be but a lytell movse, Ther ys no lorde, mo castelles haþ to kepe, Then I haue hernes &amp; hooles in to crepe. 65 “Abyde with me all nyght in þys mylle, That we togedyr may haue our dalyaunce. Of greyn &amp; mele þou shalt haue þy fylle. When frendis mete, ys ioy &amp; plesaunce. At eue at soper we shall haue a petaunce, And, when Aurora to-morow doþ apere, Or we departe, we shall dyne in fere.” 66 The ffrosshe answeryd &amp; gan hys tale telle: “I haue had here plente of vytayll, Of fresshe lycour þys ys a baren mylle. I prayse no feeste, where good drynke doþ fayll, And what ys worþe all þe apparayll Of diuerse deyntees to a mannys lust, When aftyr mete men gon awey a thrust? 67 “Good drynke at festes makeþ all þe chere, Well sesenyd mete, of good drynke habundance. Here fast[e] by ys a brode ryuere, Whyche of fresshe watyr haþ all suffisaunce. Bacus, Thetis be causers of plesaunce, Bacus god of wyne, Thetis god of water. And, to discure þe sentence of my þought, Where þey two fayle, I sey, þe fest ys nought.” 68 They passyd forþe by a grene mede: The syluer dew toward þe mornyng Haþe of þe mowse soylyd so þe wede, That he haþ lost hys power of rennyng. Thus were þese wormes contrary of lyuyng: The frosshe delyteþ to abyde in mory lakys, The mowse to fede hym on chese &amp; tendyr cakys. 69 The mowse was wery with þe frosshe to abyde, But þe frosshe with a false feynyd chere Seyþe to þe mowse: “Yende on þe oþer syde Ys myne abydyng vppon þe water clere. Lat vs go swymme ouer þe ryuere, And, lyke as I haue vnto þe tolde, Thow shalt abyde &amp; see þere my householde.” 70 The mowse answeryd quakyng in hys drede: “I haue of swymmyng noon experience.” “No,” quoth þe frosshe, “I shall tey a threde About þy nek by gret diligence, The other ende shall for þy defence At my leg sore be knyt behynde Ouer þe broke passage for to fynde.” 71 Thus gan þe ffrosshe couertly to feyne Of false fraude þe lytell mowse to drowne. The frosshe by swymmyng dyd hys besy peyne To make þe mowse lowe to plonge downe. Forþe goþ þe frosshe, þe mowse for fere gan sowne, And in þys whyle a kyte, or þey toke hede, Raught hem boþe vp hangyng by þe þrede. 72 Fatte was þe ffrosshe, þe mowse sklender &amp; lene; The frosshe deuouryd because of hys fatnes. The threde to-brake, þe mowse fell on þe grene, Fro deþe escapyd: þe frosshe for hys falsnes Gwerdon receueþ of vnkyndenes. For conclusion clerk[is] put in mynde, Lawe &amp; nature pleynyn on folke vnkynde. Conclusio. 73 Of vyces all, shortly to conclude, Ther ys no vyce in comparyson To þe vyce of ingratitude; For hit ys worse þen pestylence or poyson, More to be drad, me semeþ, of reson: Preseruatyf made for pestylence, But agayn fraude may be no defence. 74 In þys fable for an exemplary, For þe party of pure innocence, The mowse ys but sympyll, nat contrary, Where þe frosshe by fraude &amp; violence Vnder colour of frendly dylygence Was euer besy hys felow to encloy: The cause out sought hit dyd hymsylf dystroy. 75 To a deceyuour by ryght, as hit ys founde, Kynde requyreþ in folkis fraudulent, Where fraud ys vsyd, fraude mot rebounde, Gwerdon for fraude most conuenient; For whyche Isopus in hys fynall entent Thys fable wrote full soþly in hys wyt: Who useþ fraude, with fraude shalbe quyt. Explicit. FABLE IV. The Tale of þe Hownde and þe Shepe groundyd ayen periure &amp; false wytnes founde by Isopus. 76 T]he world made diuerse by froward folkis tweyne, By a false iorrour and a false wytnesse, Horryble monstres enbrasyd in a cheyne Trouþe forto assayle &amp; greuosly to oppresse, Whyche forto clypse þe lyght of ryghtwysnesse Be nat aferde with hande put forþe toforn Vppon a boke falsely to be forsworn! 77 With cancryd lyppes &amp; with tung[e] double Twene ryght &amp; wrong forþe þey woll procede, Ryghtfull causes to trauerse &amp; trouble, To be forsworn on a boke for mede, Of conscience þey take so lytell hede; Whyche þyng to preue by exsamples full notable Of olde Isopus whylom wrote þys fable. 78 Hauyng thys conceyte, set hit for a grounde; By maner lyknes rehersyng in sentence, He wrete þer was whylom a gret hounde, Whyche toke a quarell by hatefull violence Agayns a shepe simple of innocence, Whyche stood alone voyde of all refuge, Constreynyd by force to apere afore a iuge. [The Trinity MS. fails here; completing portion from Harley 2251.] 79 Agenst the sheepe, quakyng in his drede, Withouten support of any proctour, This ravenous hound thus wrongely gan procede, His tale aforsyng like a false iurrour: How he had lent the sheepe, his neygh[e]bour, A large lofe, his hunger to releve, As he was redy by lawe for to preve. 80 And his quarel more to fortefye, The sely shepe to bryng[en] in distresse, He affermed it, and falsly did lye, Towchyng his loff, that he of kyndenesse Toke it the sheepe, whan he stoode in distresse Of mortal hunger, whan plente dide faile, Likly to dye for lak of vitaile. 81 Straitly requyreng the iuge in this matiere To yeve hym audience and to do hym right, By apparence shewyng ful sad chiere, As though he ment no falsnesse to no wyght. The sely sheepe, astonyed in his sight, Stoode abasshed ful like an innocence; To help hym-self cowde fynd[e] no diffence. 82 Towchyng the loff requyred by the hound, With humble chiere the sheepe did it deny, Sothly affermyng, levyng on this ground, Vnto his day he neuer on no party No loff receyved, and loth he was to ly, Prayeng the iuge, that he myght frely gon, For other aunswer plainly cowde he none. 83 Quod the iuge: “The lawe thow must abide, Til ther be yoven sentence of iugement; I may no favour do to nowther side, But atwene both stande indifferent, As rightful iuge of hert and hole intent, Til I may se by lawe to make me strong, Whiche of the partyes have right or wrong.” 84 The lawe, first founde on a triew[e] grounde, May nat declyne from his stabilnesse. The iuge, abraidyng, axed of the hound, “Hastow,” quod he, “record or witnesse This douteful cause to set in sikernesse, For to stynt[en] al contrauersy Be triewe report of suche as wil nat ly?” 85 The hound answerd: “My cause is iust and triewe, And my-self in lawe here for to aquyte, I have brought two, that the couenant knewe, The faithful wolf, in trowth that doth delite, And with hym comyth the gentil foule, the kyte, Chose for the nones by report of theyr names, As folke wele knowe, that dredith sclaundre and shames. 86 “To offende trewth the wolf doth gretly drede, He is so stidefast and triew of his nature; The gentil kyte hath refused al falshede, He had lever grete hunger to endure, Lovyng no raveyn vnto his pasture, Thanne take a chykken, by record of writyng, To his repast, or any goselyng.” 87 The hound, to acomplissh thend of his entent, Agayn the sheepe to susteyne his partye Witnesse tweyne brought in iugement, The wolf, the puttok that were ful loth to ly; And for to stynte the contrauersy Of this matier, they vpon hem toke To lay theyr hondis boldly vpon a booke. 88 Mote they be hanged on high by the halse, Be-cawse they swore wetyngly vntriewe! The hound wele wiste his [com]playnt was false, The sheepe condempned, tristy and pale of hewe, The twey witnesse, albe it they ne knewe The matier false, rehersed here to-forn, Yit drad they nat falsely to be forsworn. 89 Thus al thre were false by oon assent, The hound, the wolf, and the cursid kyte, The sheepe, allas, though he were innocent, By doome compelled, as Isopos doth write, To pay the loff, his dettis to acquyte, Thus constrayned, the lawe dide hym compelle, At grete myschief his wynter flees to selle. 90 The ram of Colchos bare a flees of gold, Whiche was conquered manly by Iason; But this sheepe, whan he his flees hath sold, With cold constrayned, wynter cam vpon, Deyd at myschief, socour had he none; Be-twene the wolf and the puttok that nought were lost in veyne, As myn auctour sayth, parted was the kareyne. 91 The sheepe thus deyd, his body al to-rent, The ravenous wolf the kareyne did assaile; The hound recouered his part by iugement; The false kyte cast hym nat to faile, To have a repast vpon his adventaile. Thus in this world by extorcion veriliche Poore folk be devoured alwey by the riche. 92 By examples, in stwes long and large, Of grete fissh devoured bien the smale. Hardy is the bote that stryvith agenst the barge. To ouerpresse a pore man the riche set no tale. A cloth sakke stuffid, shame it is to pike a male. What nedith the see to borwe of smale rivers, Or a grete barne to borow of strait garners? 93 Al suche outrages and inconveniences Takith origynal of pillage and ravyne; An extorcioner, to amend his expences, Can make the poore to bowe and declyne; Lierne this prouerbe, founde of old doctryne, “Suche as have no conscience of no maner wronges, Of other mennys ledir can kut ful large thonges.” 94 The shepe is ded, the puttok hath his part, Ioynt from ioynt the wolf hath rent a-sunder, The hound by dome recouered hath his part, Suche false practik is vsed here and yonder: The fiebler playneth, and that is litel wonder. Al suche raveyne on poraile to theyr distresse Beganne at false iurrours and at false witnesse. 95 To a false witnesse, record in Salamon, Prouerbiorum, .iij. thynges bien compared A shrew[e]d dart, an hoked arow is oon, Al for the werre as it is declarid, Yit vnder trety somtyme they be spared; But a false witnesse hath this avauntage With mowth infect alwey to do damage. 96 Agayne sharpe quarels helpith a pavice, Agayne arowes may be made defence, And though a swerd be riche and of grete price, Somtyme he sparith for to do offence; But a false iurrour, by mortal violence, Nat only causith men her bloode to shede, But makith hem lese theyr lyf and goode for meede.” 97 Ageyne verray poyson ordeyned is triacle, As auctours sayne, by craft of medicyne; But ageyn a iurrour there were no bettir obstacle Than to geld hym yong, hys venym to declyne, That no false braunche myght spryng of his lyne, For the nombre suffisith only of ij. or iij. To enfecte a shyre or a grete contre. 98 It is remembred by record of auctours, As writeth Holcot vpon sapience, How ther folwith .iij. incomoditees Of false forsweryng ageyn conscience: First, rehersith this auctour in sentence, Vpon a booke whan a false iurrour Forswerith hym-self, he is to God a traytour. 99 There-vpon, this matier to conclude, That false forsweryng is to God treason, First he makith this simylitude: That if a man withyn a regioun Wold countrefete, by false collusioun, The kynges seale, the people to begile, What were he worthy to deye by civile? 100 And semblaly, who can considre wele, The name of God, ordeyned to impresse, Is the signacle of the celestial seale, Yoven to al Cristen of trowth to bere witnesse, And who that euer mysvsith it in falsenesse, Holcot affermyth it, for short conclusioun, That he to God doth opinly treason. 101 Who with his hand the Holy Booke doth towche, And to record takith Cristes name, On Holy Writ, I dare me wele avowche, If he swere falsely, gretely is to blame, Hande of periurye to his eternal shame; God and His werkis he doth vtterly forsake, And to the fiend for euer he doth hym take. 102 In His preceptis, whiche that be devyne, God bad man bere no false witnesse, And of oure faith to folwe the doctryne. Periury is enemy to al rightwisnesse; What man for lucre or for [gret] richesse Wilbe forsworn, by sentence of clerkis, Falsly forsakith God and al His werkis. 103 Who swerith by God, his hand leyd on a booke, He causith God, auctours doth expresse, Vnto the record of the charge he toke, In right or wronge, in trowth or in falsenesse, To preve his oth Hym takith to wittnesse: If his causyng to make his party strong, Falsly concludith, he doth to God grete wrong. 104 Of periurye the trespas is ful huge, Wonder perilous in Oure Lordis sight, For the iurrours first disseyvith the iuge, Causith his neyghburgh for to lese his right, His conscience hurt, of grace blent the light, As a renegat, that hath the Lord forsake, Lyke to be dampned, but he amendis make. 105 Isopos iurrours doth discryve, Callith theym Arpies, houndes infernal, With ravenous feete, wynged to flee blyve, Like to Carberos, that receyvith al, Gredy Tantalus, whos hunger is nat smal; And be suche peple, who that takith kepe, As sayth my[n] auctour, devoured was the shepe. 106 Thus false forsweryng, frawde, and extorcioun, With false witnesse afore God be dampnable, But if they make diew satisfaccioun, Thynges to restore, wherof they bien culpable; And for suche folkes Isopos wrote this fable, To this intent, that I have told aforn, What peril it is falsly to be forsworn. 107 Late al false iurrours have this in mynde, Remembre at shyres and at cessions: Who is forsworn, settith God behynde, And puttith the fiend in ful possessioun Of soule and body, vnder his dampcioun, Toforn his deth, but if he have repentaunce, Or make restitucioun, or do som penaunce. Here endith the .iij. fable of Isopos, what perel it is to be forsworn wetyngly, as was the wolf and the kyte for synguler love, that they hadde to the hounde, and to have the sheepe ded and slayn, as iurrours dampne þe triewe and save the false.

How the wollffe diseyvyd the crane, Isopus, translatyd by Iohn Lydgat. 108 In Isopus forther to proced, Towchynge the vyce of wnkynd[e]nesse, In this tretes a lytyll fabill I rede Of engratytude, ioynyd to falsenesse, How that a wolff, of cursyd frowardnesse Was to the crane, of malyce, as I fynde, For a good torne falce founden and wnkynd. 109 The fable is this: when bestes everychone Helde a feste and a solempnyte, Ther was a wolffe strangled with a bone, And constraynyd by grete adversyte, Des[es]peyryd relyvyd for to be, For remede playnly knew he none, So depe downe enteryd was the bone. 110 Thorow all the cort surg[e]ons wer sought, Yf eny were abydynge them a-monge; At the last the crane was forthe brought, Bycaws his neke was slender, sharp, &amp; longe, To serche his throt wher þe bone stode wronge, For whiche perlows occupacion The wolff behyte hym a full grete guerdon. 111 The bone out browght by subtile delygence Of the crane, by crafft of surgery, The court all hole being in presence, Axid his rewarde &amp; his solary,— The wolffe frowardly his promys gan deny, Sayd, “It suffisith,”—and gan to make stryffe,— “Out of his mouthe that he scapid with his lyffe.” 112 The wolffe denyed that he had be-hyte, Sowght a-gayne hym froward occacion, Seyd, he had don hym grete wn-ryght, And hym deseyvyd by fals colusion, Whan he his byll putte so low a-downe In his throt to pyke a-wey the bone; Other reward of hym gett he none! 113 Caste on the crane a full cruell loke, Withe opyn mouthe gan to approche nere, “When thow,” quod he, “the sayd[e] bone toke Out of my throt thow were in my daunger, Thy sharpe beke, neke, eyen, and chere Atwene my tethe, sharp[e] whet &amp; kene, Thy lyffe in iubardy, the truthe was welle sene. 114 “At that tyme thy power was but small, Ageyne me to holde were or stryff, For whiche thow art boundyn in speciall To thanke me thow scapidest withe thy lyff, Owt of my iawes, sharper than file or knyff, Stode desolate in many manar wyse, Streynyd in the bondes full narow of my fraunchyse.” 115 And semblably, makyng a fals excuse To pay theyr dewte wnto the poraile, Takynge ther service &amp; labour to ther vse, [Gverdounles] to make them to travayle Yf they aught ax, tyrauntes them assayle, And of malys constreyne them so for drede, They not so hardy of them to ax ther mede. 116 The tyraunt hathe possescions and riches, The poure travelythe for meate, drynke, &amp; fode, The ryche dothe the laborar oppresse, For his labour denyethe hym hys lyflode, The lambe must suffre, the wolffes bene so wode; A playne ensample declaryd how men done, Shewde in the crane that plukkyd away þe bone. [Moralization.] 117 Prayer of princes is a commaundement, The poure obayethe, they dare none othar do, Presept of tyrantes is so vyolent, Who-evar sey nay, nede it muste be so, Hove they ther lust, they care for no mo; The wolffe made holle, of very froward pryde, Sofferyd the crane rewardles to abyde. 118 The crane was chese to be a surg[i]on, To save the wolffe, as ye have hard beforne, Toke out the bone, whiche no man migh[t]e sene, Whiche thynge accomplyshyd, his labour he had lorne, The wolffe made hym blow the bokk[e]s horne,— As it fallythe at preffe, offt[e] sithe, Fayr behestes makythe foles ofte-tyme blythe. 119 Isophus, the famous olde poyete, This fable wrote for a memoryalle, The accorde wher-of wnlykely &amp; wn-mete Atwen tyrauntes &amp; folke that bene rurall, The poure hathe lytell, the extorssionar hathe all, His body, his lyffe, the laborar enpartythe, The riche hathe all, &amp; no-thynge he departythe. 120 The morallyte of this tale out sowght, The crane is lyke the folke, that for drede Travayll for tyrantes, &amp; reseve nowght Bwt fowll rebukes for [a] ffynalle mede; Thus connselynge, yow that this talle dothe rede, Whill that yowr hond is in the wolffes mowthe, Remembre that with tyrauntes merci ys wncothe. 121 To pley withe tyraunts I holde it is no iape, To oppres the poure they have no concience, Fly frome daunger, yf ye may askape, Thynke on the crane that dyd his delygence To helpe the wolfe, but he do recompence, His kyndenes maneshed hym, as I fynde, This tall applyinge a-gayn folke that be wn-kynde. finis Iohn Lydgat, wryten by Iohn Stow. FABLE VI. THE SUN'S MARRIAGE [From MS.

THE TITLE AND PEDIGREE OF HENRY VI [MS. B.M., Harley 7333, leaves 31 to 32, back.] Here begynneth a remembraunce of a peedeugre how that the kyng of Englond, Henry the Sext, is truly borne heir vnto the Corone of Fraunce by lynyall successioun, als wele on his ffader side, Henry the Fifth, whom God assoill, as by Kateryne queen of Englond, his modir, whom God assoile; made by Lydygate Iohn the monke of Bury, at Parys, by þe instaunce of my Lord of Warrewyk. Þe prolog. Trouble hertis to sette in quyete, And make folkys their language for to lette, Which disputen in their opynyons Touching the ligne of two regions, The right, I mene, of Inglond and of Fraunce, To put awey all maner [of] variaunce, Holy the doute and þe ambyguyte, To sette the ligne where hit shuld[e] be, And where hit aught iustly to abide, Wrongfull claymes for to set aside, I meved was shortly in sentement By precept first and commaundement Of the nobly prince and manly man, Which is so knyghtly &amp; so moche can, My lord of Warrewyk, so prudent &amp; wise, Beyng present that tyme at Parys Whan he was than repaired agein From Seint Iulian of Mavns, oute of Mayn, Resorted home, as folkys telle conne, From the castell þat he had[de] wonne Thurgh his knyghthode and his hy noblesse, And thurgh his wysdom &amp; his hy prowesse. Gladly he chevith what so he begynne, Sesyng not tyll he his purpos wynne, The fyn þerof berith witnessing. Lyf and goodis for title of his kyng He sparith not to put in iuperdye, Oonly the right for to magnifie Of him that is to him moste souerain, Henry the Sext, of age ny fyve yere ren, Borne to be kyng of worthie reamys two. And God graunt that it may be so, Septure and crowne þat he may in dede, As he hath right, in peas to possede. And to put his title in remembraunce, Whiche that he hath to Inglond and to Fraunce, The noble, þat worthi varioure, The Regent of þe rem[e] of Fraunce, duc of B[edford]. Whiche may be callid a very conquerour, Who lyst considre and serche by and by His grete emprise in ordre ceriously, And specially to encrece his glory, Who list remembre þe grete high victory Which that he had in Vernoill in Perche, Full notable in boke[s] oute to serche, In cronycles to be song &amp; rad; And this prince, moste discrete &amp; sad, My lord of Bedford, of Fraunce þe regent, Was the first that did his entent, By grete advys and ful hy prudence, Thurugh his labour &amp; his diligence, That made serche in cronycle full notable, By the clerk which he knew moste able, Renomed of wysdom and science, Worthie eke of fame and of credence. And I, as he that durst not withsey, Humbly his biddyng did obey, Ful desirous him to do plesaunce, With fere suppresed for my ignoraunce, And in my hert quakyng for drede; And as I kend began to taken hede Vnto the Frenssh compiled by Laurence, In substaunce filowyng the substaunce Of his writyng and compilacioun. All be þat I in my translacioun To my helpe nor to my socoure Of rethoryk have no maner floure, Yit shal I folow my maistre douteles, Calot, and be not recheles Liche his writyng my stiel to direct; Wher I dar pray hem to correct, I mene tho þat shall hit sene or rede; And right forth, who so lyst take hede, Vndir favour and supportacioun, Thus I begyn on my translacioun. Here endith the prolog, and begynneth the translacioun. Crist Ihesu, Prince and souerain Lord Of vnyte, of peas, and of accorde, Seyng the myschief &amp; þe hie distaunce Betwene the kynges of Englond and of Fraunce; Peryll of soules both[e] nygh and ferre, By occasioun of the mortall werre; Seyng also the grete confusioun Of both reames, by devisioun Thurgh feyned falshed caused cursidly By the Dolphyn, that so horribly Made sleen withoute drede or shame, At Monstreux, a toun of grete fame, Iohn duc of Burgoyne, by grete violence, Doyng to him honure &amp; reuerence, And euermore of inyquite, By false tresoun and cursed cruelte Compassed; alas! þat was to grete a ruth Undir colour and shadowe of veray trouth, In dispite of the Chirche, alas! Hauyng no reward in þis horrible cas To suerte nor othe ymade to-forne, Nor asurance in holy place asworne, The high lord, Herry Bully, to offende; That wit of man coude not comprehende, That this Dolfyn shuld in any wise So hygh tresoun compassen or devise, Himself, alas! in hindryng of his name, Thurgh the world to sclaundre &amp; to blame; Causing in soth his vnabilite For to succede to any dignite, Of knyghtly honure to regne in any lond, As by letres ensealid with his hond Clerly recorde, truth[e] woll not vary, He to his othe wirching the contrary: Consideryng this &amp; peised in balaunce, Touching the right of true enheritaunce, God thurgh his myght who can vndirstond More of grace than of mannes hond, All oure trouble to enden &amp; to fyne, By purveaunce, which þat is devyne, Provided hath of his hy[e] grace For reames two large to compasse A rightfull heir, I dare hit wel endite, As þis figure vnto euery wight Shewyng in ordre descendyng lyne right, To forein blode þat it not ne chaunge, The crowne to put in non hondis straunge, But it conveied þere it shuld be. Shewyng of þe peedegre in portrature. Verily, liche as ye may se, The pee-degre doth hit specifie, The figure, lo, of the genelagye, How that God list for her purchase Thurgh his power and benigne grace, An heir of peas by iust successioun, This ffigure makith clere demonstracioun, Ageins which noman may maligne, But þat he stondith in þe veray ligne, As ye may se, as descendid is Of the stok and blode of Seint Lowys; Of which we aught of equite &amp; right In oure hertis to be glad and light, That we may se with euery circumstaunce Direct the lyne of Englond &amp; of Fraunce. On þe othir part byhold &amp; ye may se Shewyng þe portratur of þe pedegre. Henry comes direct from St. Louis. How this Herry in þe eight degre Is to Seint Lowys sone &amp; very heir; To put awey all doute &amp; dispair, God hath for vs so graciously provided, To make al oon that first was devided, That this Herry stonding in the lyne, Thurgh Goddis hond &amp; purviaunce devyne, Is iustly borne, to voide all variaunce, For to be kyng of Englond &amp; of Fraunce; To whom we owe truly to obey In euery thing, ther is nomore to sey; By whom we se the werre doutelesse Fully finisshed, brought in werre &amp; peas, Betwix this noble worthi reames twayn, Ful long aforne with labour &amp; grete payn Sought &amp; required, which ben now at rest, Thanked be God, þat all doth for the best; And that this peas in sothfast vnyte, Be endid sone withoute strif or plee, By thavise and mediacioun Made by trete of both regioun, Sworne and asured by full besy peyn Of both parties at Trois in Champoigne. Charlis þe Sext makyng thassurance, Thilke tyme beyng kyng of Fraunce; The quene also sworne in the same wise, And after hem, as I shal devise, The boke also entouchid with his hond, Was Herry sworne, kyng of Eng[e]lond, Heir of Fraunce, and also regent, And Phelip eke beyng þere present, Duc of Burgoyne, assured eke &amp; sworne, Sone to the duc of whom I spake byforne, That slayn was &amp; murdred traitoursly; Than thre astatis beyng by &amp; by, Prelatis, Erles, Lordis, and Barons, Sworne and assured, of both regions, As the traite fully hath devised. And there in Troys also was solempnesed The mariage, to conferme vp the peas; And to declare the maner douteles Of this weddyng, who so lyst to serche, At Seint Petirs Aundels of the chirche, The said Herry, manly &amp; prudent, Of Englond kyng, of Fraunce the regent, Etrouthed hath my lady Kateryn, And þe mystery wich that is devyne. O[f] mariage by grete reuerence, The sacrement for the excellence He hath worshipped, and full humbly In the chirch made axid openly, After custume of hy or low degre, To shew ensample of humylite. In the chirche thries of Seint Iohn, Liche the custume of new &amp; yore agon, Thries publisshed in open audience, As the lawe byndeth in sentence. Touching the statuyt in cas of mariage, For any fauour of blode or lynage, The cours suyng in all his hole entent, And in no wise list not be exempte; From poynt to poynt list no thing withdrawe, The bonde filowyng of Holy Chirche lawe, Notwithstonding his astate riall: But in his chirche þan parochiall Of Seint Iohn he came with good entent, For to receive the holy sacrement Of mariage, he and Kateryn, As ye toforne haue herd me determyn. The which Herry if I shal discryve, I dare wele sey þere was neuer on lyve No manlier to speke of worthinesse, Of gouernaunce, nor of hy prowesse, Whiche thurgh his manhode &amp; grete labour, Lyche a notable worthi conquerour Cesid not, thurgh his besy peyne, Iustly to bring worthi reames twayn Vndir oo crowne by desceynt of lyne; For which he may among þe Worthie Nyne Truly be set &amp; reconed for oon, Who can take hede among hem euerichone. And of this Henry, of knyghthode moste famous, Moste avisy, and moste victorious, From Seint Lowys in the right[e] lyne, I sey, of him and of Kateryne, Doun in ordre by corious lyneall, Descendid is from þe stok riall Of Seint Lowis, who can vndirstond, Henry the Sext, borne in Eng[e]lond, For to possede by enheritaunce Crownes two of Englond &amp; of Fraunce, By true title, as ye haue hard toforne, The first yere in soth that he was born. By the which of [hem] he &amp; his fader dere Both[e] two passing in oon yere, Eueriche in haste suyng aftir othir, Kyng of Fraunce, Charles þ[e Sext], &amp; þe kyng of Englond, Her[ry the Fift]. By pitous faate, hit wold be non othir, The yere of grace by computacioun A thousand foure hundrid by conclusioun Twenty and two, who so compte right. God graunt her soulis of her grete myght Ioy &amp; rest which is eternall, In his court aboue celestiall; And graunt oure kyng ioy, honure &amp; glorye, Peas &amp; quiete, &amp; of his foon the victorye, To loue his people, &amp; to be loved ayen, As þei loued her lord most souerain, Charles þe Sext, which was his aiell; And in doctryne he norisshed be aswele, And als wys and prudent fynally, As was his fader callid eke Henry. Graunt him grace &amp; also good fortune, In his regnes also to contynue His riall lyne also to habound, And that hit may verily be founde Hy to encrece in worship &amp; vertue, As an heir blessed of Ihesu, And of renoun excellent in vertue. To drawen oute a true peedegrue, Lyneally descending even adoun From Seint Lowys, most famous of renoun, And renommed of parfite holynesse; And specially, the trouth[e] to expresse, Amonges oþer to reken euerychone, Of Frenssh-men oonly þere was oon From the trouth which wold not varie, Oure liege lord chosen secretary For his feithfull true diligence, Which by name callid is Laurence Calet, of the Counseill clerk, Which toke on him þe laboure of this werk, Euer aftir to be rad &amp; song; First to compile hit in þe Frenssh tong, Compendiously drawe hit in sentence In that language, by grete prouidence, As he þat was passing excellent, In rethoryk famous &amp; eloquent, And diligent withouten any slouth To declare oute the trouth, The chaf to voide &amp; take the true corne. Of which my lorde þat I spak of byforne, My Lord of Warrewyk, ful worthi of renoun, Of high prudence &amp; discrecioun, Touching þe writyng of this Calot clerk, Draw into Frenssh by his besy werk, Gaf me precept in conclusioun To make therof a playn translacioun In Englissh tong, &amp; bad me hit translate. And to reherce þe very true date Of this labour, when I first bygan, Hit was in soth, as I reherce can, The monyth of Iuyll twenty daies comen, And eight ouere, when þe sonne shone Made his paleys &amp; his duellyng place Ameddis the heuen in the thrid[de] face, The signe I mene callid the Lioun, Which is the toure &amp; chief mansioun Where Phebus hath moste souerain dignite And thilke tyme in the thritteneth degre He entred was of the same signe, Thatempre wedir lusty and benigne, Saturne beyng in the Scorpyoun, In which he hath no domynacioun, Ne dignite, shortly for to tary; Iubiter in þe Sagittary Seven degres wher he is dignified, Full fortunat &amp; gretly magnified; Furious Mars, þe ferfull red[e] sterre, Causar of stryf, patroun of þe werre, With his bemes cast moste feruently, Was two pocys passed of Gemeny; Fressh Venus, lady of Citheroun, Was nyne degrees entred the Lyoun; And þe mone, with her hernes pale, From the Bolle gan her cours availe; The same tyme when þat Mercurious In the Lioun had[de] take his hous, Ful contrary to his dignite, Beyng tho in the tenth degre; And of the Bulle also douteles By accomptes also twenty grees Entred was the hed of the Dragoun; And his taill in thopposicioun; The same tyme, as I vndirstond, My Lord bad me þis werk take an hond. That he may se his generacioun Vnto the forteth multiplicacioun Victoriously for to regnen here, Aftir this lif aboue the sterres clere, God him graunt oonly of his grace Of mercy þere for to haue a place. 29.

Make him myhty with vertuous levyng His mortall foon to oppressen and bere adoun, And him to encresen as Cristis champioun, Alle myscheffes ffrom hym to abrigge With the grace off God at thentryng off the Brigge.” 14 Twoo antelopes stondyng on eytheyr syde With the armes off Englond and off Fraunce, In tokenyng that God shall ffor hym provyde, As he hath tytle by iuste enheritaunce To regne in pees, plente and plesaunce; Sesyng off werre, that men mow ryde or goon, As trewe lieges, theyre hertes made both oon. 15 Ferthermore, so as the Kyng gan ryde, Midde off the Brigge ther was a tour on loffte, The Lorde off Lordes beyng ay his guyde, As He hath be and yitt wole be ffull offte; The tour arrayed with welvettes soffte, Clothis off golde, sylke, and tapcerye, As apperteynyth to his regalye. 16 And at his komyng, off excellent beaute, Beyng off port most womanly off chere, Ther yssed oute emperesses three; Theyre heer dysplayed as Phebus in here spere, With crovnettes off golde and stones clere; At whos out komyng they yaff such a liht, That the byholders were stonyed in theire siht. 17 The ffirst off hem called was Nature, As she that hath vnder her demeyne, Man, beeste, and ffoule, and euery creature, With-inne the bondys off hire goldyn cheyn; Eke heven, and erthe, and euery creature This emperesse off custume doth enbrace; And next hire komyth hire sustre called Grace, 18 Passyng ffamous, and off grete reuerence, Moste desired in all regions; For wher that euer she with here precence, She bryngeth gladnes to citees and tovns; Off alle well ffare she holdeth the possessions, For, I dar say, prosperyte in no place No while abydith, but yff ther be grace. 19 In tokne that Grace shulde longe contune Vnto the Kyng she shewed hire ffull benyngne; And next hire come the emperesse, Fortune, Apperyng to hym with many a noble sygne, And ryall toknes, to shewe that he was dygne, Off God dysposed as Grace lyst to ordeyne, Vpon his heede to were crovnes tweyne. 20 Thes three ladyes, alle off oon entent, Three goostly gifftes, hevenly and devyne, Vnto the Kyng anoon they dydde present, And to His Hyhnesse they dydd anoon enclyne; And, what they were pleynly to termyne, Grace gaff him ffirst at his komyng Twoo riche gifftes, Sciens and Kunnyng; 21 Nature gaff him eke strenth and ffeyrenesse, Forto be lovyd and dredde off euery wiht; Fortune gaff him eke prosperite and richesse, With this scripture apperyng in theire siht, To him applyed off verrey dewe riht, “First vndirstonde and ioyfully procede Intende, prospere et regna. And lange to regne” the scripture seyde in dede. 22 This ys to mene, who-so vndirstonde a-riht, Thow shalt be Fortune haue lange prosperite; And be Nature thow shalt haue strenth and myht, Forth to procede in lange ffelicite; And Grace also hath graunted vnto the, Vertuously lange in thy ryall citee, With septre and crovne to regne in equyte.” 23 On the riht hande off thes emperesses Stoode sevyn maydenys verrey celestyall; Lyke Phebus bemys shone hire goldyn tresses, Vpon here heedes eche havyng a cornall, Off porte and chere semyng inmortall, In siht transendyng alle erthely creatures, So aungelyk they wern off theyre ffigures. 24 Alle cladde in white, in tokne off clennesse, Lyche pure virgynes as in theyre ententys, Shewyng outward an hevenly ffressh brihtnesse; Stremed with sonys were alle theire garmentis, Afforne provyded ffor pure innocentis, Most columbyne off chere and off lokyng, Mekely roos vp at komyng off the Kyng. 25 They hadde an bawdrykes alle off saffir hewe, Goynge outward gan the Kyng salewe, Hym presentyng with her gifftes newe, Lyche as theym thouht yt was vnto hem dewe, —Which goostly gifftes here in ordre sewe, Dovne dessendyng as syluere dewe ffro hevyn, Alle grace include with-inne thes gifftes sevyn; 26 Thes ryall gifftes ben off vertue moste Goostly corages, moste sovereynly delyte; Thes gifftes called off the Hooly Gooste, Outward ffigured ben vii dowys white— And seyyng to him, lyke as clerkes write, “God the ffulfille with intelligence And with a spyryt off goostly sapience. 27 “God sende also vnto thy moste vaylle Impleat te Deus spiritu sapiencie et intellectus, spiritui consilij et ffortitudinis et sciencie &amp; pietatis et spiritui timoris Domini.

Thes were theire gifftes shortly in sentence: 29 “God the endewe with a crovne off glorie, And with septre off clennesse and pytee, And with a swerde off myht and victorie, And with a mantel off prudence cladde thow be, A shelde off ffeyth fforto defende the, An helme off helthe wrouht to thyn encrees, Girt with a girdyll off love and parfyte pees.” 30 Thes sevyn virgyns, off siht most hevenly, With herte, body, and handes reioysynge, And off othir cheris appered murely For the Kyngis gracious home komynge; And ffor gladnesse they beganne to synge, Moste aungelyk with hevenly armonye, This same roundell, which I shall now specyfye: 31 “Sovereyne Lorde, welcome to youre citee; Welcome, oure Ioye, and oure Hertis Plesaunce, Welcome, oure Gladnesse, welcome, oure Suffisaunce, Welcome, welcome, riht welcome mote ye be. “Syngyng to-fforn thy ryall Mageste, We say off herte, withoute variaunce, Sovereyne Lorde, welcome, welcome ye be. 32 “Meire, cite?enis and alle the comounte, At youre home komyng now out off Fraunce, Be grace relevyd off theyre olde grevaunce, Syng this day with grete solempnyte, Sovereyne Lorde, welcome to youre citee.” 33 Thus resseyvyd, an esy paas rydyng, The Kyng is entred into this Citee: And in Cornhill anoon at his komyng, To done plesaunce vnto his Magestee, A tabernacle surmountyng off beaute, Ther was ordeyned, be fful ffressh entayle, Richely arrayed with ryall apparayle. 34 This tabernacle off moste magnyficence, Was off his byldyng verrey imperyall Made ffor the lady callyd Dame Sapience; To-fore whos fface moste statly and ryall Wern the sevyn sciences called lyberall Rounde aboute, as makyd ys memorie, Which neuere departed ffrom hire consistorie. 35 First ther was Gramer, as I reherse gan, Chieff ffounderesse and roote off all konnyng, Septem sciencie liberales. Which hadde a-fforne hire olde Precian; And Logyk hadde afforn hire stondyng Arestotyll moste clerkely dysputyng; And Rethoryk hadde eke in hire presence, Tulyus, called Mirrour off Eloquence; 36 And Musyk hadde, voyde off alle discorde, Boece, hire clerke, with hevenly armonye, And instrumentis alle off oone accorde; Forto practyse with sugred melodye He and his scolers theyre wyttes dydde applye, With touche off strenges on orgons eke pleyng, Theyre craffte to shewe at komyng off the Kyng; 37 And Arsmetryk, be castyng off nombrarye, Chees Pyktogeras ffor hire partye; Called chieff clerke to governe hire lybrarye, Euclyde toke mesours be craffte off Gemetrye; And alderhyhest stode Astronomye, Albunisar last with hire off sevyn, With instrumentis that rauht vp into hevyn. 38 The chieff pryncesse called Sapience Hadde to-forn hire writen this scripture: “Kynges,” quod she, “moste off excellence, Per me reges regnant. Et gloriam sapiencie possidebunt. By me they regne and moste in ioye endure, For thurh my helpe, and my besy cure, To encrece theyre glorie and hyh renoun, They shull off wysdome haue ffull possessioun.” 39 And in the ffront off this tabernacle, Sapience a scripture ganne devyse Able to be redde with-oute a spectakle, Et nunc reges intelligite et erudimini qui iudicatis terram. To yonge kynges seyynge in this wyse, “Vnderstondith and lernyth off the wyse, On riht remembryng the hyh lorde to queme, Syth ye be iuges other ffolke to deme.” 40 Ferthermore the matere doth devyse: The Kyng, procedyng fforth [vp]on his way, Kome to the Conduyte made in cercle wyse; Whame to resseyve, ther was made no delay, And myddys above in ffull riche array, Ther satte a childe off beaute precellyng, Middis off the throne rayed lyke a kyng. 41 Wham to governe, ther was ffigured tweyne, Domina misericordia a dexteris et Domina vèritatis a senistris cum clemencia roborabitur thronus eius. Misericordia &amp; veritas custodiunt regem. A lady, Mercy, satte on his riht syde; On his lyffte hande, yff I shall nat ffeyne, A lady, Trouthe, his domes to provyde; The lady Clemens aloffte dydde abyde, Off God ordeyned in the same place The Kyngis throne strongely to enbrace. 42 For, by the sentence off prudent Salamon, Mercy and Riht kepyn euery kyng, And Clemence kepte by Resoun His myhty throne ffrom myschieff and ffallyng, And makith yt stronge with lange abydyng; For I darr say thes sayde ladyes three A kyng preserve in lange prosperytee. 43 Thanne stoode also affore the seyde kyng Twoo iuges with ffull hyh noblesse— Viij sergeauntes echon representyng Iudicium &amp; Iusticiam. For comvne profyte, doom and rihtwysnesse— With this scripture, which I shall expresse: “Honour off kyngys, in euery mannys siht, Of comyn custum lovith equyte and riht.” 44 Kyng Dauyd wrote, the Sawter berith wytnesse, Honor Regis Iudicium diligit. “Lorde God,” quod he, “thy dome yeve to the Kyng, Deus iudicium tuum Regi da, et iusticiam tuam ffilio Regis. And yeve thy trouthe and thy rihtwysnesse The Kyngis sone here in his levyng”; To vs declaring, as by theyre writyng, That kyngis, princes, shulde aboute hem drawe Verba translatoris. Folke that be trewe and well expert in lawe. 45 The Kyng fforth rydyng entryd Chepe anoon, A lusty place, a place off alle delycys; Kome to the Conduyt, wher, as cristall stoon, The watir ranne like welles off Paradys, The holsome lykour, ffull riche and off grete prys, Lyke to the water off Archedeclyne, Which by miracle was turned into wyne. 46 Thetes, which that is off waters chieff goddesse, Thetes est dea aquarum. Hadde off the welle power noon ne myht, For Bachus shewed there his ffulsomnesse Bachus vere est deus vini. Off holsome wynes to euery manere wiht; For wyn off nature makith hertes liht, Wherfore Bachus, at reuerence off the Kyng, Shewed oute his plente at his home komyng. 47 Wyn ys a likour off recreacioun, That day presentyd in tokne off alle gladnesse, Vnto the Kyng off ffamous and hyh renoun, From vs texile alle manere hevynesse; For with his komyng, the dede berith wytnesse, Out off the londe he putte away alle trouble, And made off newe oure ioyes to be double. 48 Eke at thes welles there were virgyns three Which drewe wyn vp off ioye and off plesaunce, Mercy and Grace, theyre suster eke Pyte; Mercy mynystred wynes off attemperaunce, Grace shedde hire likour off goode gouernaunce, And Pitee profered with ffull goode ffoysoun Wynes off comforte and consolacioun. 49 The wyn off Mercy staunchith by nature The gredy thristis off cruell hastynesse, Grace with hire likour cristallyne and pure Defferrith vengaunce off ffurious woodnesse, And Pitee blymsith the swerde off Rithwysnesse; Covenable welles, moste holsom off savour, Forto be tasted off euery governour. 50 O! how thes welles, who-so take goode hede, With here likours moste holsome to atame, Affore devysed notably in dede Forto accorden with the Meirys name; Nomen Maioris Iohannes Welles. Which by report off his worthy ffame That day was busy in alle his gouernaunce, Vnto the Kyng fforto done plesaunce. 51 Ther were eke treen, with leves ffressh off hewe, Alle tyme off yeer, ffulle off ffruytes lade, Off colour hevynly, and euery-liche newe, Orenges, almondis, and the pome-gernade, Lymons, dates, theire colours ffressh and glade, Pypyns, quynces, blaunderell to disport, And the pome-cedre corageous to recomfort; 52 Eke the ffruytes which more comvne be— Quenynges, peches, costardes and wardouns, And other meny ffull ffayre and ffressh to se; The pome-water and the gentyll ricardouns; And ageyns hertes ffor mutygaciouns Damysyns, which with here taste delyte, Full grete plente both off blak and white. 53 And besydis this gracious paradys, Alle ioye and gladnesse fforto multyplye, Twoo olde men, ffull circounspecte and wyse, There dydde appere lyke ffolkes off ffeyrye; The toon was Ennok, the tothir Elye, The Kyng presentyng theire gifftes ffull notable, That God conferme his state ay to be stable. 54 The ffirst seyde, with benyngne chere, Nichil proficiat Inimicus in eo. Et ffilius iniquitatis non apponat nocere ei. Gretly desirynge his prosperyte, That noon enemyes have in him power, Nor that no childe by ffalse iniquyte Parturble neuere his ffelicite; Thus olde Ennok the processe gan well telle, And prayd ffor the Kyng as he roode by the welle. 55 Affter, Elyas, with his lokkes hoore, Seyde well devoutly, lokyng on the Kyng, Dominus conseruet eum et viuificet eum et beatum faciet eum. “God conserve the and kepe the euermore, And make him blessid, here in erthe levyng, And preserve him in alle manere thyng, And specially amongis kynges alle, In enemyes handes that he neuere ffalle.” 56 And at fronteur off thes welles clere, Ther was a scripture komendyng the lykour;— “Yee shall drawe waters, with goode chere, Oute off welles off oure Savyour, Haurietis aquas in gaudio de ffontibus Salvatoris. Which have vertue to curen alle langour, Be influence off her grete swetnesse, Hertes avoydyng off alle theire hevynesse.” 57 Thanne ffrom thes welles off ffulsome habundaunce, With theyr lykours as eny cristall clene, The Kyng roode fforth, with sobre contenaunce, Towarde a castell bilt off iaspar grene, Vpon whos toures the sonne shone shene, Ther clerly shewed, by notable remembraunce, This kyngis tytle off England and off Fraunce. 58 Twoo green treen ther grewe vp-[a]riht, Fro Seint Edward and ffro Seint Lowys, The roote y-take palpable to the siht, Conveyed by lynes be kyngis off grete prys; Some bare leopardes, and some bare fflouredelys, In nouther armes ffounde was there no lak, Which the sixte Herry may now bere on his bak. 59 The [pe]degree be iuste successioun, As trewe cronycles trewly determyne, Vnto the Kyng ys now dessended dovn From eyther partye riht as eny lyne; Vpon whos heede now ffresshely done shyne Two riche crovnes most sovereyn off plesaunce To brynge inne pees bitwene England and Fraunce. 60 Vpon this castell on the tothir syde There was a tree, which sprange out off Iesse, Ordeyned off God ffull longe to abyde;— Dauyd crovnyd ffirst ffor his humylite The braunches conveyd, as men myht[e] se, Lyneally and in the Genologie, To Crist Ihesu, that was born off Marie. 61 And why the Iesse was sette on that partye, This was the cause in especyall, For next to Paulis, I dar well specefye, Is the partye moste chieff and princypall, Callyd off London the chirche cathederall, Which ought off reson the devyse to excuse, To alle thoo that wolde ageyn yt ffroune or muse. 62 And ffro that castell the Kyng fforth gan him dresse Toward Poulys, chieff chirche off this citee, And at Conduyt a liht, and a lyknesse Indevysible made off the Trinite, A throne compassid off his ryall see; Aboute which, shortly to conclude, Off hevenly aungelles wern a grete multitude; 63 To whom was yoven a precept in scripture, Angelus eius mandavit de te. Wrete in the ffrontour off the hyh[e] stage, That they shulde done theyre besy cure, To kepe the Kyng [sure] ffrom alle damage In his lyff here, duryng alle his age, Hys hyh renoun to sprede and shyne fferre, And off his twoo reemes to sese the mortall werre. 64 And laste was wretyn in the ffronterys: “I shall ffulfille him with ioye and habundaunce, And with lengthe off [many] holsome yeerys, And I shall shewe him my helpe with alle plesaunce, And off his lieges ffeythfull obeyssaunce, And multyplye and encrese his lyne And make his noblesse thurh the worlde to shyne. 65 “Love off his peple, ffauour off alle straungers, In bothe his remys pees, reest, and vnyte, Be influence off the nyne sperys, Longe to co[n]tune in his ryall see, Grace to cherice the Meire and the Citee, Longe in his mynde to be conceyved With how good will, that day he was resseyved.” 66 Comyng to Poulis ther he liht adovn, Entryng the chirche ffull demure off chere, And there to mete him with processioun Was the Erchebisshop, and the Chaunceller, Lyncoln, and Bathe, off hoole herte and entier, Salysbury, Norwich, and Ely, In pontyficall arrayed richely. 67 Ther was the Bisshop off Rouchestre also, The Dene off Paulys, the Chanons euerychon, Off dew[e]te as they auht to do, On processioun with the Kyng to goon; And thouh I kan nat reherse hem oon by oon, Yitt dar I say, as in theyre entent, To do theyre devere ffull trewly they ment. 68 Lyke theyre estates fforth they ganne procede; With obseruaunces longyng ffor a kyng Solempnely gan him conveye in dede Vp into the chirche with ffull devoute syngyng; And whanne he hadde made his offryng, The Meire, the citezenis, abode and lefft him nouht, Vnto Westmynstre tyl they hadde him brouht; 69 Where alle the covent, in copys richely, Mette with him off custume as they ouht; The Abbot affter moste solempnely Amonges the relikes the septre oute souht Off Seint Edward, and to the Kyng it brouht; Thouh it were longe, large, and off grete weyht, Yitt on his shuldres the Kyng bare it on heyht, 70 Into the mynstre, while alle the belles ronge, Tyl he kome to the hyh awtere; And ffull devoutly Te Deum ther was songe, And the peple, gladde off looke and chere, Thanked God with alle here hertes entere, To se theire Kyng with twoo crovyns shyne, Ex duabus arboribus Sancti Edwardi &amp; Sancti Lodowici.

[Occasional Poems.] 34. VERSES ON CAMBRIDGE. [Baker's MS., Camb. Univ. 24, pp. 249–250.] 1 By trew[e] recorde of the Doctor Bede, That some tyme wrotte so mikle with his hand, And specially—remembringe as I reede In his Cronicles made of England— Amoung other thyngs, as ye shall understand— Whom for myne aucthour I dare alleage— Kouth þe translation &amp; buylding of Cambridge; 2 With hym accordynge, Alfride the Croniclere— Seriouslye who lyst his booke to see, Made in þe tyme when he was Thresurere Of Beverley, an old famouse cytye— Affirme &amp; seyne, the Universitie Off Cambridge &amp; studye fyrst began By þat wrytinge, as I reporte can. 3 He rehersing first for commendacion, By þat wrytinge, how that old cytie Was stronglie whalled with towers manye one, Builte &amp; finished with great libertie, Notable &amp; famous, of greate authoritie, As theis authors accordinge sayne þe same, Of Cantabro takyng first his name. 4 Like as I finde—reporte I can none other— This Canteber tyme of his lyvynge To Pertholyne he was germayne brother, Duke in tho dayes, in Ireland a great kynge, Chieffe &amp; principall cause of that buildyng; The wall about &amp; towers as they stoode Was sett &amp; builte upon a large floode, 5 Named Cantebro, a large brode ryver, And after Cante called Cantebro. This famous citie, this write the cronicler, Was called Cambridge; rehersing eke also In þat booke theis authors bothe twoe. Towching the date, as I rehear[s]e can, Fro thilke tyme that the world began 6 Fower thowsand complete, by accompt[e]s clere, And three hundreth by computacion, Ioyned therto eight &amp; fortie yeare, When Cantebro gave the foundacion Of thys cytie &amp; this famous towne, And of this noble universitie, Sett on this ryver which is called Cante; 7 And fro the greate transmigracion Of kyns reconned in the Byble of old, Fro Ierusalem to Babylon Two hundreth wynter &amp; thirtie years told— Thus to write myne author maketh me bold— When Cantebro, as it [is] well kouthe, At Atheynes scholed in his youth, 8 All his wytts greatlye did applie To have acquayntance by great affection, With folke experte in philosophie. From Atheynes he brought with him downe Philosophers most sovereigne of renowne, Unto Cambridge, playnlye this is the case, Anaxamander &amp; Anaxogoras, 9 With many other, myne Authours dothe declare; To Cambridge fast[e] can hym spede, With philosophers, &amp; let for no cost spare, In the scholes to studdie &amp; to reede, Of whoes teachynge great profit þat gan spread And great increase rose of his doctrine; Thus of Cambridge þe name gan first shyne 10 As chieffe schoole &amp; universitie. Unto this tyme fro the daye it began, By clere reporte, in many a far countre; Unto the reigne of Cassibellan—, A woorthie prynce &amp; a full knightlie man, As sayne cronicles, who with his might[y] hand Let Iulius Cesar to arryve in this land—, 11 Five hundreth yere, full thirtie yere &amp; twentie Fro Babylons transmigracion, That Cassibelane reigned in Britaine, Which, by his notable royall discrecion, To increase that studdie of great affection, I meane of Cambridge the Universitie Franchised with manye a libertie. 12 By the meane of his royall favor, From countreis about[en] manye one, Divers schollers, by diligent labour, Made þat resorte of great affection; To that stooddie great plentye there cam downe, To gather fruits of wysedome &amp; science And sondrie flowers of sugred eloquence. 13 And as it is put eke in memorie, Howe Iulius Cesar, entring this region, On Cassybellan after his victorye, Tooke with him clarks of famous renowne Fro Cambridge, &amp; ledd them to Rome Towne; Thus by process remembred here-to-forne, Cambridg was founded long or Chryst was borne— 14 Five hundreth yere, thirtie &amp; eke nyne. In this matter ye gett no more of me, Reherse I wyll no more at this tyme. Theis remembranc[e]s have great authoritie, To be preferred of long antiquitie; For which by recorde, all clarks seyne þe same, Of heresie Cambridge bare never blame. 35. DEATH'S WARNING. [MS. Bodley, Douce, 322, leaves 19b. to 20.] 1 Syth that ye lyste to be my costes, And in your book to set[ten] myne image, Wake and remembre wyth grete auys[in]es, Howe my custome and mortall vsage Ys for to spare nether olde ne yonge of age, But that ye nowe in thys world leuyng, Afore be redy or I my belle rynge. 2 My dredefull spere [that ys] full sharpe ygrounde Doth yow now, lo, here thys manace, Armour ys noon that may withstande hys wounde Ne whom I merke ther ys non other grace, To fynde respite of day, oure, ne space; Wherfore be redy, and haue no dysdeyne Yef of my commyng the tyme be vncerteyne. 3 Remembre your yeres almost past be, Of flowryng age lasteth but a seasoun, By procese at ey[e] men may see Beaute declyneth, hys blossom falleth doune, And lytyll and lytyll, tyll by successioun Cometh croked elde, vnwarly [in] crepyng, With hys patent purely than manysshyng. 4 The gospell byddeth than [to] wake and pray[e]; For of my commyng there ys no tyme sette, Ne no man knoweth [the hour] when he shall d[e]ye, Ne agayne myne entre no gate may be shutte; Twene me and kynde ther ys a knot [y-knet] That in thys worlde euery lyuyng creature For Adams synne must dye of nature. 5 O worldely folke, auerteth and take hede What vengeaunce and punycioun God shall take, after ye be dede, For your trespas and youre transgressioun, Whyche breken hys preceptes ayenst all reasoun; Ye haue foryete howe, with hys precious bloode Yow for to saue, he dyed on the roode. 6 Lerne for to dye and hate for to lye, Of olde offens amonge haue repentaunce, And to eschewe all skorne and mok[e]ry[e], Ayenst vyces do almes and penaunce, And for to haue moste souueranly plesaunce, To sewe the pathes of oure lorde Ihesu, Trewe exampeler of grace and vertew, 7 Whyche for oure sake and oure redempcioun, And for oure loue was nayled to a tree, Suffred payne and [cruel] passioun, And nothyng asketh of hygh ne lowe degree, Recompensed ayenwarde for to be, But that we sette all holy oure ententes, For to fulfyll hys commaundmentys, 8 Wherby men may that prudent be and wyse, The ioyes clayme, whyche be eternall, And entre [ageyn] in-to paradyse, From whens [our fadyr] Adam had a fall; To whyche place aboue celestiall, O Cryste Ihesu, so brynge vs to that glory, Whyche by thy dethe had[dest] the victory. Amen. 36. ON THE DEPARTING OF THOMAS CHAUCER (1417). [MS. B.M., Adds. 16165, leaves 248 to 249, back.] Balade made by Lydegate at þe Departyng of Thomas Chaucyer on Ambassade in-to France 1 O þow Lucyna, qwene and empyresse Of waters alle, and of floodes rage, And cleped art lady and goddesse Of iorneying and fortunate passage, Governe and guye by grace þe vyage, Þowe Heuenly Qweene, sith I of hert[e] prey My maystre Chaucyer goodely to convey, is Thomas. 2 Him to expleyten, and firþerne on his way With holsome spede, ay in his iournee. And Neptunus, make eke no delaye Hym to fauour whane he is on þe see, Preserving him frome al aduersytee, Frome al trouble of wynde and eke of wawe. And lat þy grace so to him adawe 3 Þat wher to hym may beo moost plesaunce, Þer make him lande, he and his meynee. And God I prey, þe whyle he is [in] Fraunce, To sende him helthe and prosparytee, Hasty repayre hoome to his cuntree, To reconfort þer with his presence Folkys þat mowrne moost for his absence. 4 For soþely nowe þagreable sonne Of housholding and fulsum haboundaunce Eclipsid is, as men recorden konne, Þat founden þer so ryche souffisaunce, Fredam, bountee, with gode governaunce, Disport, largesse, ioye and al gladnesse, And passingly goode chere with gentylesse. 5 Ceres also, goddesse of welfare, Was ay present, hir chaare with plentee lade; And Bacus þer ne koude neuer spare With his lykour hertes for to glade, Refresshe folkis þat were of colour fade, With his conduytes moost plentyvous habounde, Þe wellis hed so fulsome ay is founde. 6 His moost ioye is innly gret repayre Of gentilmen of heghe and lowe estate, Þat him thenkeþ, boþe in foule and fayre, With-outen hem he is but desolate; And to be loued þe moost fortunate Þat euer I knewe, with othe of soþefastnesse, Of ryche and pore, for bounteuouse largesse. 7 And gentyl Molyns, myn owen lord so der, Lytel merveyle þoughe þow sighe and pleyne; Now to forgone þin owen pleying feere, I wot right wel, hit is to þe gret peyne. But haue good hope soone for to atteyne Þin hertis blisse agayne, and þat right sone, Or foure tymes echaunged be þe mone. 8 Lat be youre weping, tendre creature, i. la femme Chaucer. By my sainte Eleyne fer away in Ynde. How shoule ye þe gret woo endure Of his absence, þat beon so truwe and kynde? Haþe him amonge enprynted in your mynde, And seythe for him, shortly in a clause, Goddes soule to hem þat beon in cause. 9 Ye gentilmen dwelling envyroun, His absence eke ye aught to compleyne, For farwell nowe, as in conclusyoun Youre pleye, your ioye, yif I shal not feyne; Farwel huntyng and hawkyng, boþe tweyne, And farewel nowe cheef cause of your desport, For he absent, farewel youre recomfort. 10 Late him not nowe out of remembraunce, But euer amonge haþe him in memoyre; And for his saake, as in youre dalyaunce, Saythe euery day deuotely þis memoyr(r)e, “Saint Iulyan, oure ioye and al oure gloyre, Come hoome ageyne, lyche as we desyre, To suppowaylen al þe hole shyre.” 11 And for my part, I sey right as I thenk, I am pure sory and hevy in myn hert, More þan I expresse can wryte with inke, Þe want of him so sore doþe me smert; But for al þat hit shal me nought astert, Daye and night, with hert[e] debonayre, And prey to God, þat he soone may repayre. 37. OF THE SODEIN FAL OF PRINCES IN OURE DAYES. [MS. Trin. Coll., R. 3. 20, pp. 359 to 361.] Here folowen seven balades made by Daun Iohn Lydegate of þe sodeine fal of certain Princes of Fraunce and Englande nowe late in oure dayes. 1 Kyng Edward of Carnarvan.Beholde þis gret prynce Edwarde þe Secounde, Which of diuers landes lord was and kyng, But so governed was he, nowe vnderstonde, By suche as caused foule his vndoying, For trewly to telle yowe with-oute lesing, He was deposed by al þe rewmes assent, In prisoun murdred with a broche in his foundament. 2 Kyng Richard þe Seconde.Se howe Richard, of Albyon þe kyng, Which in his tyme ryche and glorious was, Sacred with abyt, with corone, and with ring, Yit fel his fortune so, and eke his cas, Þat yvel counseyle rewled him so, elas! For mys-treting lordes of his monarchye, He feyne was to resigne and in prysone dye. 3 Kyng Charlles.Lo Charles, of noble Fraunce þe kyng, Taken with seknesse and maladye, Which lefft him never vnto his eonding, Were it of nature, or by sorcerye, Vnable he was for to governe or guye His reaume, which caused suche discencyon, Þat fallen it is to gret destruccion. 4 Se nowe þis lusty Duc of Orlyaunce, Þe Duc of Orlyence. Which floured in Parys of chiuallerie, Broþer to Charles, þe kyng of Fraunce: His yong[e] hert[e] thought[e] never to dye, But for he vsed þe synne of lecherye, His cosin to assent[e] was ful fayene, i. Duc of Burgoigne Iohn. Þat he in Parys was murdred and foule slayne. 5 Of Edward þe Thridde Thomas his sone, Thomas Duc of Gloucestre. Of Gloucestre Duc, Constable of England, Which to love trouth was ever his wone, Yet not-with-stonding his entent of trouthe, He murdred was at Caleys, þat was routhe, And he to God and man moste acceptable, And to þe comvne profit moste fauorable. 6 Lo here þis Eorlle and Duc of Burgoyne boþe, Iohn Duc of Bourgoyne. Oon of þe douspiers and deen of Fraunce, Howe fortune gan his prosparite to looþe, And made him putte his lyff in suche balaunce Þat him navayled kyn nor allyaunce, Þat for his mourder he mortherd was and slayne, Of whos deth þErmynakes were fayne. 7 Þis Duc of Yrland, of England Chaumburleyn, Þe Duc of Yrland. Which is plesaunce so he ledde his lyff, Tyl fortune of his welthe hade disdeyn, Þat causeles he parted was frome his wyff, i. laumerrane. Which grounde was of gret debate and stryff, And his destruccion, if I shal not lye, For banned he was, and did in meschef dye. 38. HORNS AWAY. [MS. Laud Misc. 683, leaves 53 to 54, back]. Here gynneth a Dyte of Womenhis Hornys 1 Off God and kynde procedith al bewte; Crafft may shewe a foreyn apparence, But nature ay must haue the souereynte. Thyng countirfeet hath noon existence. Tween gold and gossomer is greet dyfference; Trewe metall requeryth noon allay; Vnto purpos by cleer experyence, Beute wol shewe, thogh hornys wer away. 2 Ryche attyres of stonys and perre, Charbonclys, rubyes of moost excellence, Shewe in dirknesse lyght where so they be, By ther natural hevenly influence. Doublettys of glas yeve a gret evydence, Thyng counterfeet wol faylen at assay; On this mater concludyng in sentence, Beute wol shewe, thogh hornes were away. 3 Aleyn remembreth—his compleynt who lyst see, In his book of ffamous elloquence— Clad al in flours and blosmes of a tre He sauh Nature in hir moost excellence, Vpon hir hed a kerche[f] of Valence, Noon other richesse of counterfet array: Texemplyfie by kyndely provydence, Beute wol shewe, thogh hornes wer away. 4 Famous poetis of antyquyte, In Grece and Troye renomed of prudence, Wrot of Queen Heleyne and Penolope, Of Pollycene, with hir chast innocence; For wyves trewe calle Lucrece to presence; That they wer faire ther can no man sey nay; Kynde wrouht hem with so gret dyllygence, Ther beute kouth, hornys wer cast away. 5 Clerkys recorde, by gret auctoryte, Hornes wer yove to bestys ffor dyffence— A thyng contrarie to ffemynyte, To be maad sturdy of resystence. But arche wives, egre in ther vyolence, Fers as tygre ffor to make affray, They haue despit, and ageyn concyence, Lyst nat of pryde, ther hornes cast away. Lenvoye. 6 Noble pryncessis, this litel schort dyte, Rudely compyled, lat it be noon offence To your womanly mercyfull pyte, Though it be rad in your audyence; Peysed euery thyng in your iust aduertence, So it be noon dysplesaunce to your pay, Vnder support of your pacyence, Yeveth example hornes to cast away. 7 Grettest of vertues ys humylyte, As Salamon seith, sonne of sapyence, Most was accepted onto the Deyte; Taketh heed herof, yeveth to his wordis credence, How Maria, which hadde a premynence Above alle women, in Bedlem whan she lay, At Crystys birthe no cloth of gret dispence, She wered a kouercheef, hornes wer cast away. 8 Off birthe she was hihest of degre, To whom alle angellis dyd obedyence, Of Dauid-is lyne wich sprang out of Iesse; In whom alle vertues by iust convenyence, Maad stable in God by goostly confydence, This rose of Iericho, ther greuh non suych in May, Pore in spirit, parfit in pacyence, In whom alle hornes of pride wer put away. 9 Modyr of Ihesu, myrour of chastyte, In woord nor thouht that neuere dyd offence, Trewe examplire of virgynyte, Hed-spryng and welle of parfit contynence, Was neuer clerk by rethoryk nor scyence Koude alle hir vertues reherse on-to this day; Noble pryncessis, of meek benyvolence, Be example of hir your hornes cast away.

Harley 2255, leaves 45, back, to 47]. 1 Riht myhty prynce, and it be your wille, Condescende leiser for to take, To seen the content of this litil bille, Which whan I wrot, myn hand I felte quake. Tokne of mornyng, weryd clothys blake, Cause my purs was falle in gret rerage, Lynyng outward, his guttys wer out shake, Oonly for lak of plate and of coignage. 2 I souhte leechys for a restoratiff, In whom I fond no consolacioun, Appotecaryes for a confortatiff, Dragge nor dya was noon in Bury toun; Botme of his stomak was tournyd vp-so-doun, A laxatif did hym so gret outrage, Made hym slendre by a consumpcioun, Oonly for lak of plate and of coignage. 3 Ship was ther noon, nor seilis reed of hewe, The wynd froward to make hem ther to londe, The flood was passyd, and sodeynly of newe, A lowh ground-ebbe was faste by the stronde; No maryneer durste take on honde, To caste an ankir for streihtnesse of passage, The custom skars as folk may vndirstonde, Oonly for lak of plate and of coignage. 4 Ther was no tokne sent doun from the Tour, As any gossomer the countirpeys was liht; A ffretyng etyk causyd his langour By a cotidian whi[c]h heeld hym day and nyht; Sol and Luna were clypsyd of ther liht, Ther was no cros, nor preent of no visage, His lynyng dirk, ther wer no platys briht, Oonly for lak and scarsete of coignage. 5 Harde to likke hony out of a marbil stoon, For ther is nouthir licour nor moisture; An ernest grote, whan it is dronke and goon, Bargeyn of marchauntys, stant in aventure; My purs and I be callyd to the lure Off indigence, our stuff leyd in morgage. But ye, my Lord, may al our soor recure, With a receyt of plate and of coignage. 6 Nat sugre-plate, maad by thappotecarye, Plate of briht metal, yevith a mery soun, In Boklerys-bury is noon such letuary. Gold is a cordial, gladdest confeccioun, A-geyn etiques of oold consumpcioun, Aurum potabile for folk ferre ronne in age, In quynt-essence best restauracioun With siluer plate, enprentyd with coignage. [Lenvoye.] 7 O seely bille, why art thu nat ashamyd, So malapertly to shewe out thy constreynt? But pouert hath so nyh thy tonne attamyd That nichil habet is cause of thy compleynt. A drye tisyk makith oold men ful feynt; Reediest weye to renewe ther corage, Is a fressh dragge, of no spycis meynt, But of a briht plate, enpreentyd with coignage. 8 Thu mayst afferme, as for thyn excus, Thy bareyn soyl is sool and solitarye; Of cros nor pyl ther is no reclus, Preent nor impressioun in al thy seyntuarye. To conclude breefly, and nat tarye, Ther is no noyse herd in thyn hermytage, God sende soone a gladdere letuarye With a cleer soun of plate and of coignage. Explicit quod Lydgate. 40.

Trinity Coll., Camb., R. 3. 20, pp. 40–48.] Nowe foloweþe here þe maner of a bille by wey of supplicacion putte to þe kyng holding his noble feest of Cristmasse in Þe Castel of Hertford as in a disguysing of þe rude vpplandisshe people compleynyng on hir wyves, with þe boystous aunswere of hir wyves, devysed by Lydegate at þe request of þe Countre Roullour Brys slayne at Loviers. Moost noble Prynce, with support of Your Grace Þer beon entred in-to youre royal place, And late e-comen in-to youre castell, Youre poure lieges, wheche lyke no-thing weel; Nowe in þe vigyle of þis nuwe yeere Certeyne sweynes ful [froward of ther chere] Of entent comen, [fallen on ther kne], For to compleyne vn-to Yuoure Magestee Vpon þe mescheef of gret aduersytee, Vpon þe trouble and þe cruweltee Which þat þey haue endured in þeyre lyves By þe felnesse of þeyre fierce wyves; Which is a tourment verray importable, A bonde of sorowe, a knott vnremuwable. For whoo is bounde or locked in maryage, Yif he beo olde, he falleþe in dotage. And yong[e] folkes, of þeyre lymes sklendre, Grene and lusty, and of brawne but tendre, Phylosophres callen in suche aage A chylde to wyve, a woodnesse or a raage. For þey afferme þer is noon eorþely stryff May beo compared to wedding of a wyff, And who þat euer stondeþe in þe cas, He with his rebecke may sing ful offt ellas! Lyke as þeos hynes, here stonding oon by oon, [i. demonstrando vj. rusticos.] He may with hem vpon þe daunce goon, Leorne þe traas, booþe at even and morowe, Of Karycantowe in tourment and in sorowe; Weyle þe whyle, ellas! þat he was borne. For Obbe þe Reeve, þat gooþe heere al to-forne, He pleyneþe sore his mariage is not meete, For his wyff, Beautryce Bittersweete, Cast vpon him an hougly cheer ful rowghe, Whane he komeþe home ful wery frome þe ploughe, With hungry stomake deed and paale of cheere, In hope to fynde redy his dynier; Þanne sitteþe Beautryce bolling at þe nale, As she þat gyveþe of him no maner tale; For she al day, with hir iowsy nolle, Hathe for þe collyk pouped in þe bolle, And for heed aache with pepir and gynger Dronk dolled ale to make hir throte cleer; And komeþe hir hoome, whane hit draweþe to eve, And þanne Robyn, þe cely poure Reeve, Fynde noone amendes of harome ne damage, But leene growell, and soupeþe colde potage; And of his wyf haþe noone oþer cheer But cokkrowortes vn-to his souper. Þis is his servyce sitting at þe borde, And cely Robyn, yif he speke a worde, Beautryce of him dooþe so lytel rekke, Þat with hir distaff she hitteþe him in þe nekke, For a medecyne to chawf with his bloode; With suche a metyerde she haþe shape him an hoode. And Colyn Cobeller, folowing his felawe, demonstrando pictaciarium. Haþe hade his part of þe same lawe; For by þe feyth þat þe preost him gaf, His wyff haþe taught him to pleyne at þe staff; Hir quarter-strooke were so large and rounde Þat on his rigge þe towche was alwey founde. Cecely Soure-Chere, his owen precyous spouse, Kowde him reheete whane he came to house; Yif he ought spake whanne he felt[e] peyne, Ageyne oon worde, alweys he hade tweyne; Sheo qwytt him euer, þer was no thing to seeche, Six for oon of worde and strookes eeche. Þer was no meen bytweene hem for to goone; What euer he wan, clowting olde shoone Þe wykday, pleynly þis is no tale, Sheo wolde on Sondayes drynk it at þe nale. His part was noon, he sayde not oonys nay; Hit is no game but an hernest play, For lack of wit a man his wyf to greeve. Þeos housbondemen, who-so wolde hem leeve, Koude yif þey dourst telle in audyence What foloweþe þer of wyves to doone offence; Is noon so olde ne ryveld on hir face, Wit tong or staff but þat she dare manase. Mabyle, God hir sauve and blesse, Koude yif hir list bere here of witnesse: Wordes, strookes vnhappe, and harde grace With sharp[e] nayles kracching in þe face. I mene þus, whane þe distaff is brooke, With þeyre fistes wyves wol be wrooke. Blessed þoo men þat cane in suche offence Meekly souffre, take al in pacyence, Tendure suche wyfly purgatorye. Heven for þeyre meede, to regne þer in glorye, God graunt al housbandes þat beon in þis place, To wynne so heven for His hooly grace. Nexst in ordre, þis bochier stoute and bolde demonstrando Carnificem. Þat killed haþe bulles and boores olde, Þis Berthilmewe, for al his broode knyff, Yit durst he neuer with his sturdy wyff, In no mater holde chaumpartye; And if he did, sheo wolde anoon defye His pompe, his pryde, with a sterne thought, And sodeynly setten him at nought. Þoughe his bely were rounded lyche an ooke She wolde not fayle to gyf þe first[e] strooke; For proude Pernelle, lyche a chaumpyoun, Wolde leve hir puddinges in a gret cawdroun, Suffre hem boylle, and taake of hem noon heede, But with hir skumour reeche him on þe heued. Shee wolde paye him; and make no delaye, Bid him goo pleye him a twenty deuel wey. She was no cowarde founde at suche a neode, Hir fist ful offt made his cheekis bleed; What querell euer þat he agenst hir sette, She cast hir not to dyen in his dette. She made no taylle, but qwytt him by and by; His quarter sowde, she payde him feythfully, And his waages, with al hir best entent, She made þer-of noon assignement. Eeke Thome Tynker with alle hees pannes olde, demonstrando þe Tynker. And alle þe wyres of Banebury þat he solde— His styth, his hamour, his bagge portatyf— Bare vp his arme whane he faught with his wyff. He foonde for haste no better bokeller Vpon his cheeke þe distaff came so neer. Hir name was cleped Tybot Tapister. To brawle and broyle she nad no maner fer, To thakke his pilche, stoundemel nowe and þanne, Thikker þane Thome koude clowten any panne. Nexst Colle Tyler, ful hevy of his cheer, Compleyneþe on Phelyce his wyff, þe wafurer. Al his bred with sugre nys not baake, Yit on his cheekis some-tyme he haþe a caake So hoot and nuwe, or he can taken heede, Þat his heres glowe verray reede, For a medecyne whane þe forst is colde, Making his teethe to ratle, þat beon oolde. Þis is þe compleynt, þat þeos dotardes oolde Make on þeyre wyves, þat beon so stoute and bolde. Þeos holy martirs, preued ful pacyent, Lowly beseching in al hir best entent, Vn-to Youre Noble Ryal Magestee To graunte hem fraunchyse and also liberte, Sith þey beoþe fetird and bounden in maryage, A sauf-conduyt to sauf him frome damage. Eeke vnder support of youre hyeghe renoun, Graunt hem also a proteccyoun; Conquest of wyves is ronne thoroughe þis lande, Cleyming of right to haue þe hyegher hande. But if you list, of youre regallye, Þe Olde Testament for to modefye, And þat yee list asselen þeyre request, Þat þeos poure husbandes might lyf in rest, And þat þeyre wyves in þeyre felle might Wol medle amonge mercy with þeyre right. For it came neuer of nature ne raysoun, A lyonesse toppresse þe lyoun, Ner a wolfesse, for al hir thyraunye, Ouer þe wolf to haven þe maystrye. Þer beon nowe wolfesses moo þane twoo or three, Þe bookys recorde wheeche þat yonder bee. distaves. Seoþe to þis mater of mercy and of grace, And or þees dotardes parte out of þis place, Vpon þeyre compleynt to shape remedye, Or þey beo likly to stande in iupardye. It is no game with wyves for to pleye, But for foolis, þat gif no force to deye! Takeþe heed of þaunswer of þe wyves. Touching þe substance of þis hyeghe discorde, We six wyves beon ful of oon acorde, Yif worde and chyding may vs not avaylle, We wol darrein it in chaumpcloos by bataylle. Iupart oure right, laate or ellys raathe. And for oure partye þe worthy Wyff of Bathe Cane shewe statutes moo þan six or seven, Howe wyves make hir housbandes wynne heven, Maugre þe feonde and al his vyolence; For þeyre vertu of parfyte pacyence Parteneþe not to wyves nowe-adayes, Sauf on þeyre housbandes for to make assayes. Þer pacyence was buryed long agoo, Gresyldes story recordeþe pleinly soo. It longeþe to vs to clappen as a mylle, No counseyle keepe, but þe trouth oute telle; We beo not borne by hevenly influence Of oure nature to keepe vs in sylence. For þis is no doute, euery prudent wyff Haþe redy aunswere in al suche maner stryff.

Wryng hem, yee, wryng, so als God vs speed, Til þat some tyme we make hir nases bleed, And sowe hir clooþes whane þey beoþe to-rent, And clowte hir bakkes til somme of vs beo shent; Loo, yit þeos fooles, God gyf hem sory chaunce, Wolde sette hir wyves vnder gouuernaunce, Make vs to hem for to lowte lowe; We knowe to weel þe bent of Iackys bowe. Al þat we clayme, we clayme it but of right. Yif þey say nay, let preve it out by ffight. We wil vs grounde not vpon wommanhede. Fy on hem, cowardes!

Þis noble Prynce, moost royal of estate, Having an eyeghe to þis mortal debate, First aduerting of ful hyeghe prudence, Wil vnavysed gyve here no sentence, With-oute counseylle of haste to procede, By sodeyne doome; for he takeþe heede To eyþer partye as iuge indifferent, Seing þe paryll of hasty iugement; Pourposiþe him in þis contynude stryffe To gif no sentence þer-of diffynytyff, Til þer beo made examynacyoun Of oþer partye, and inquysicyoun.

A MUMMING AT LONDON. [MS. Trin. Coll. Camb., R. 3. 20, pp. 55–65.] Lo here filoweþe þe deuyse of a desguysing to fore þe gret estates of þis lande, þane being at London, made by Lidegate Daun Iohan, þe Munk of Bury. of Dame Fortune, Dame Prudence, Dame Rightwysnesse and Dame Fortitudo. beholdeþe, for it is moral, plesaunt and notable. Loo, first komeþe in Dame Fortune. Loo here þis lady þat yee may see, Lady of mutabilytee, Which þat called is Fortune, For seelde in oon she dooþe contune. For as shee haþe a double face, Right so euery houre and space She chaungeþe hir condycyouns, Ay ful of transmutacyouns. Lyche as þe Romans of þe Roose Descryveþe hir, with-outen glose, And telleþe pleyne, howe þat she Haþe hir dwelling in þe see, Ioyning to a bareyne roche. And on þat oon syde dooþe aproche A lytel mountaygne lyke an yle; Vpon which lande some whyle Þer growen fresshe floures nuwe, Wonder lusty of þeyre huwe, Dyuers trees, with fruyte elade. And briddes, with þeyre notes glaade, Þat singen and maken melodye; In þeyre hevenly hermonye Somme sing on hye, and some lowe. And Zepherus þeer dooþe eeke blowe With his smooþe, attempree ayre. He makeþe þe weder clere and fayre And þe sesoun ful of grace. But sodeynly, in lytel space, Vpon þis place mooste ryal Þer comeþe a wawe and for-dooþe al. First þe fresshe floures glade On þeyre stalkes he doþe faade. To þeyre beautee he dooþe wrong; And þanne farweel þe briddes song. Braunche and boughe of euery tree She robbeþe hem of hir beautee, Leef and blossomes downe þey falle. And in þat place she haþe an halle, Departed and wonder desguysee. Frome þat oon syde, yee may see, Ceryously wrought, for þe noones, Of golde, of syluer, and of stoones, Whos richesse may not be tolde. But þat oþer syde of þat hoolde Is ebylt in ougly wyse, And ruynous, for to devyse; Daubed of clay is þat doungeoun, Ay in poynt to falle adoun. Þat oon fayre by apparence, And þat ooþer in existence Shaken with wyndes, rayne and hayle. And sodeynly þer dooþe assayle A raage floode þat mancyoun, And ouerfloweþe it vp and doun. Her is no reskous, ner obstacle Of þis ladyes habytacle. And as hir hous is ay vnstable, Right so hir self is deceyuable: In oo poynt she is neuer elyche; Þis day she makeþe a man al ryche And thorughe hir mutabilytee Casteþe him to morowe in pouertee. Þe proddest she can gyve a fal: She made Alexaundre wynnen al, Þat noman him with stonde dare, And caste him dovne, er he was ware. So did sheo Sesar Iulius: Sesar a bakars seon. She made him first victorius, Þaughe to do weel sheo beo ful looþe; Of a bakers sonne, in sooþe, She made him a mighty emperrour, And hool of Roome was gouuernour, Maugrey þe Senaat and al þeyre might; But whanne þe sonne shoone mooste bright Of his tryumphe, fer and neer, And he was corouned with laurier, Vnwarly thorughe hir mortal lawe With bodekyns he was eslawe At þe Capitoyle in Consistorye, Loo, affter al his gret victorye. See, howe þis lady can appalle Þe noblesse of þeos prynces alle. She haþe two tonnys in hir celler; Þat oon is ful of pyment cler, Confeit with sugre and spyces swoote And manny delytable roote. But þis is yit þe worst of alle: Þat oþer tonne is ful of galle; Whoo taasteþe oon, þer is noon ooþer, He moste taaste eeke of þat toþer. Whos sodeyne chaunges beon not sofft, For nowe sheo can reyse oon alofft, Frome lowghe estate til hye degree. In olde storyes yee may see Estates chaunge, whoo takeþe keepe. For oon Gyges, þat kepte sheepe, Sheo made, by vertu of a ring, For to be made a worþy kyng; And by fals mourdre, I dare expresse, He came to al his worthynesse— Moost odyous of alle thinges. And Cresus, ricchest eeke of kynges, Was so surquydous in his pryde, Þat he wende, vpon noo syde Noon eorþely thing might him pertourbe, Nor his ryal estate distourbe. Til on a night a dreme he mette, Howe Iuvo in þe ayre him sette Ecclesiasticus xxvj? cap?. And Iubiter, he vnderstondes, Gaf him water vn-to his handes, And Phebus heelde him þe towayle. But of þis dreme þe devynayle His doughter gane to specefye, And fer to-forne to prophesye, Whiche called [was] Leryopee. Sheo sayde, he shoulde an hanged bee; Þis was hir exposicyoun. Loo, howe his pruyde was brought adovne. And alle þeos chaunges, yif þey beo sought, Þis fals lady haþe hem wrought, Avaled with þeyre sodeyne showres Þe worþynesse of conquerroures. Reede of poetes þe comedyes; And in dyuers tragedyes Yee shal by lamentacyouns Fynden þeyre destruccyouns— A thousande moo þan I can telle—, In-to mescheef howe þey felle Dovne frome hir wheel, on see and lande. Þer-fore, hir malys to withstande, Hir pompe, hir surquydye, hir pryde, Yif she wol a whyle abyde, Foure ladyes shall come heer anoon, Which shal hir power ouergoone, And þe malys eeke oppresse Of þis blynde, fals goddesse, Yif sheo beo hardy in þis place Oonys for to shewe hir double face. Nowe komeþe here þe first lady of þe foure, Dame Prudence. Loo, heer þis lady in youre presence Of poetis called is Dame Prudence, Þe which with hir mirrour bright, By þe pourveyaunce of hir forsight And hir myrrour, called provydence, Is strong to make resistence In hir forsight, as it is right, Ageyns Fortune and al hir might. For Senec seyþe, who þat can see, Þat Prudence haþe eyeghen three, Specyally in hir lookynges To considre three maner thinges, Alweyes by goode avysement: Thinges passed and eeke present, And thinges affter þat shal falle. And she mot looke first of alle, And doon hir inwarde besy peyne, Thinges present for to ordeyne Avysely on euery syde, And future thinges for to provyde, Þe thinges passed in substaunce For to haue in remembraunce. And who þus dooþe, I say þat hee Verrayly haþe yeghen three Comitted vn-to his diffence, Þe truwe myrrour of prouydence. Þane þis lady is his guyde, i. providencia. Him to defende on euery syde Ageyns Fortune goode and peruerse And al hir power for to reuerse. For fraunchysed and [at] liberte, Frome hir power to goo free, Stonde alle folkes, in sentence Wheeche beon gouuerned by Prudence. Nowe sheweþe hir heer þe secounde lady, Dame Rigwysnesse. Seoþe here þis lady, Rightwysnesse. Of alle vertues she is pryncesse, For by þe scales of hir balaunces Sheo sette hem alle in gouuernaunces. She putteþe asyde, it is no dreede, Frenship, fauour and al kyns meede. Love and drede she setteþe at nought, For rightful doome may not beo bought. And Rightwysnesse, who can espye, Haþe neyþer hande ner yeghe. She loste hir hande ful yore agoone, For she resceyueþe gyfftes noone, Noþer of freonde, neyþer of foo. And she haþe lost hir sight al-soo, For of right sheo dooþe provyde, Nought for to looke on neyþer syde, To hyeghe estate, ner lowe degree, But dooþe to boþen al equytee, And makeþe noon excepcyoun To neyþer part, but of raysoun. And for þe pourpos of þis mater Of a iuge yee shal heere, Which neuer his lyff of entent Þer passed no iugement By his lippes of falsnesse; Of whome þe story dooþe expresse, Affter his deeþe, by acountes cleer, More þane three hundreþe yeer, His body, as is made mencyoun, Was tourned vn-to corrupcyoun, Þe story telleþe, it is no dreed; But lyche a roos, swoote and reed, Mouþe and lippes werne yfounde, Nought corrupte, but hoole and sounde. For trouth is, þat he did expresse In alle hees doomes of rithwysnesse. For þis lady with þeos balaunce Was with him of acqweyntaunce, Which him made in his ententys To gyf alle rightwyse iugementis. Where fore þis lady, which yee heer see With hir balaunces of equytee, Haþe þe scaalis honged soo, Þat she haþe no thing to doo Neuer with Fortunes doublenesse. For euer in oon stant Rightwysnesse, Nowher moeving too ne froo In no thing þat she haþe to doo. Loo, heer komeþe in nowe þe thridde lady, called Fortitudo. Takeþe heede, þis fayre lady, loo, Ycalled is Fortitudo, Whame philosophres by þeyre sentence Ar wonte to cleepe Magnyfysence. And Fortitudo soþely sheo hight, Ageyns alle vyces for to fight, Confermed as by surtee Ageynst all aduersytee. In signe wher of sheo bereþe a swerde, Þat sheo of no thing is aferd. For comune profit also she, Of verray magnanymyte, Thinges gret dooþe vnderfonge, Taking enpryses, wheeche beon stronge. And moost sheo dooþe hir power preove A communaltee for to releeve, Namely vpon a grounde of trouthe; Þanne in hir þer is no slouthe For to maynteyne þe goode comune. And alle þassautes of fortune, Of verray stidfastnesse of thought Alle hir chaunges she sette at nought. For þis vertu magnyfycence Thorough hir mighty excellence She armed þeos philosophres oolde, Of worldely thing þat þey nought tolde Recorde vpon Dyogenes, On Plato and on Socrates. She made Cypion of Cartage To vnderfongen in his aage For comune proufyte thinges gret; i. republica. And for no dreed list not leet, Ageynst Roome, þat mighty tovne, For to defende his regyoun. Sheo made Hector for his cytee To spare for noon aduersytee, But, as a mighty chaumpyoun, In þe defence of Troyes toun To dye with-outen feer or dreed. And þus þis lady, who takeþe heed, Makiþe hir chaumpyoun[e]s strong, Parayllous thinges to vnderfong, Til þat þey þeyre pourpos fyne. Recorde of þe worthy nyen, Of oþer eeke þat weere but late, I meene prynces of latter date. Herry þe Fyfft, I dare sey soo, He might beo tolde for oon of þoo; Empryses wheeche þat were bygonne He lefft not til þey weere wonne. And I suppose, and yowe list see, Þat þees ladyes alle three Wer of his counseyle doutelesse, Force, Prudence and Rightwysnesse. Of þeos three he tooke his roote, To putte Fortune vnder foote. And sith þis lady, in vertu strong, Sousteneþe trouthe, and dooþe not wrong, Late hir nowe, to more and lasse, Be welcome to yowe þis Cristmasse. And þeos edoone, komeþe inne þe feorþe lady, cleped Dame Feyre and Wyse Attemperaunce. Þis feorþe lady þat yee seon heer, Humble, debonayre and sadde of cheer, Ycalled is Attemperaunce; To sette al thing in gouuernaunce And for hir sustres to provyde, Vyces alle shal circumsyde, And setten hem in stabulnesse. With hir Cousin Soburnesse She shal frome vyces hem restreyne And in vertu holde hir reyne, And þer-inne gyf hem libertee, Eschuwing alle dishonestee; And hem enfourmen by prudence, For to haue pacyence, Lownesse and humylytee, And pruyde specyally to flee. Contynence frome gloutonye, Eschuwe deshoneste compaignye, Fleen þe dees and þe taverne, And in soburnesse hem gouverne; With hert al þat euer þey can, In vertu loven euery man; Sey þe best ay of entent: Whoo þat seyþe weel, dooþe not repent. Detraccion and gloutouny, Voyde hem frome þy companye And al rancoure sette asuyde. Be not to hasty, but euer abyde, Specyally to doone vengeaunce; In aboode is no repentaunce. And in vertu whoo is þus sette, Þanne beo þeos sustres weel ymette; And sooþely, if it beo discerned, Who by þeos foure is þus gouuerned— Þus I mene: þat by Prudence He haue þe myrrour of Provydence. For to consider thinges alle, Naamely parylles, or þey falle— And who þat haue by gouuernaunce Of Rightwysnesse þe ballaunce, And strongly holde in his diffence Þe swerd of hir Magnyfycence: Yee beon assured frome al meschaunce, Namely whanne þat Attemperaunce Hir sustre gouuerneþe al three. Frome Fortune yee may þane go free, Booþe alwey in hert and thought. Whyle yee beo soo, ne dreed hir nought, But avoydeþe hir acqweyntaunce For hir double varyaunce, And fleoþe oute of hir companye And alle þat beon of hir allye. And yee foure susters, gladde of cheer, Shoule abyde here al þis yeer In þis housholde at libertee; And ioye and al prosparytee With yowe to housholde yee shoule bring. And yee all foure shal nowe sing With al youre hoole hert entiere Some nuwe songe aboute þe fuyre, Suche oon as you lykeþe best; Lat Fortune go pley hir wher hir list. Explicit. 44. A MUMMING AT WINDSOR. [MS. Trin. Coll.

God of his grace caste on þat place a sight, For to þat reavme in passing avauntage In þilke vale was sette þat hermytage. 7 Al þis came in, whoo-so list to seen, I dare afferme it with-oute any dreed, By parfytnesse of þe hooly qweene, Saynte Cloote, floure of wommanheed. What euer she spake, acordant was þe deed: I mene it þus, þat worde and werke were oon; It is no wonder, for wymmen soo beon echoon.

In hir þer was so entier diligence, Fully devoyde of slouthe and necglygence, Ne stynt nought, til þat hir lord haþe take Þe feyth of Cryst and his errour forsake. 10 Þis made, þe kyng þat Crystes feyth tooke, For he was booþe manly and rightwys, Þe three crepaudes þis noble kyng forsooke, And in his sheelde he bare thre floure delys, Sent frome heven, a tresore of gret prys; Affter at Reynes, þe story telleþe þus, Baptysed lowly of Saint Remigius. 11 Þampolle of golde a colver brought adovne, With which he was, þis hooly kyng, ennoynt.

And youre estate al-so to magnefye, Þis aark of God, to make you gracyous, Shal stille abyde with you in youre hous. 14 For whyles it bydeþe stille in youre presence, Þe hyeghe Lord shal blesse booþe yowe and youres, Of grace, of fortune sende yowe influence And of vertue alle þe fresshe floures; And of aduersytee voyde awey þe shoures, Sette pees and rest, welfare and vnytee Duryng youre tyme thoroughe-oute þis cytee.

AMOR VINCIT OMNIA MENTIRIS QUOD PECUNIA. [MS. B.M. Harley 2251, leaves 46, back, to 48, back.] 1 Eche man folwith his owne fantasye Liche as it fallith in his oppinioun, His witte enclyneng vnto that partie Where as his hert hath made eleccioun. Whiche of the two by ust comparisoun Love or money in valew doth excede? To gyve an answer for short conclusioun, Love is sette bakke, gold goth byfore, and mede. 2 Fressh lusty lovers professed to Venus, Sworn to service of the god Cupyde, Suche of corage as bene amerous, On theyr hye hors prowdly whan they ride Seyn how that love sette euery thyng aside; The revers founde in bookis, who list reede, Make no comparisoun, wayte on the tyde, Love is set bakke, gold goth byfore, and mede. 3 Remembre Troye, of Troylus and Cres[e]ide, Eche in theyr tyme furtherd to plesaunce; But what fille after longe or Troylus deyde? A false serpent of chaunge and variaunce Withouten any lengger attendaunce Put out Troylus, and set in Dyomede. What shal I say or conclude in substaunce? Love was set bakke, gold went afore, and mede. 4 Men seyn how Amor vincit omnia, Of hie noblesse love is so corageous; But folk expert seyn how pecunia Put at preef is more victorious. Toforne Haniball preferrid was Cresus, Wher gold and tresoure makith folk to spede, An evidence how Cupide and Venus In al suche case, ben set abak for mede. 5 Ovyde saith, whos writyng is ful kowth, How Socrates for al his sapience, The Greke Omerus with his sugre mowth, Tullius put out for al theyr eloquence; Where love in povert lakkith his dispence, Farewele! adieu! prayer ne may nat spede The cause out sought, of longe experience, Olde aqueyntaunce is set abakke for mede. 6 Love peysith nat ageyne an hevy purs, Trowth is nat herd where lak is of richesse, A false forswerer dredith nat Goddis kurs, To be forsworn for lucre in his falsenesse; Reken storyes of marcial noblesse, Prowesse of princes, allyaunce of hye kynrede, The old auctours can bere hereof witnesse, Love hath ful oft be set abak for mede. 7 Take it for a custome, it wil be non other, In worldly quarels lucre goth toforn. A man for wynnyng wil forsake his brothir, Som tyme for lucre weede above the corn, For lucre alday men wilbe forsworn, Chaunge hath be founde som tyme in wommanhede; In al suche case love blowith the bukkis horn, Where olde acqueyntaunce is sette abak for meede. 8 Paris, for love he gate the qwene Heleyne; Cleopatras loved Anthonius tresoure, Trewe Piramus he felt also grete peyne, For love of Thesbe suffred grete langoure; Kynge Alisaundre, the grete conqueroure, Beloved of Candace, who that can take hede; Concludyng thus, in al worldly laboure Love in al thyng is set abak for mede. 9 Ovyde doth write that goddis and goddessis Have a delite gyftes for to take, And of custom princis and princessis, Who gevith hem ought, they wil it nat forsake; Love may go pley, and his dogge hey shake, For any friend he fyn[dith] at strayt nede; Thus concludyng, short proces for to make, Frendship goth bak, gold goth before, and mede. 10 Frenship on these dayes in fayre langage feyned With a gladd chiere, outward, wordes of liberte, At a straite suche love nys but disdeyned, To fynde socour in his necessite; Al nys nat golde that shyneth bright, parde! Money as revel ay the daunce doth lede; Love is put bak by false duplicite, For in eche court, gold goth before, and mede. 11 The world vnsure, fortune is variable, Booth right friendly founde in prosperite; Put at assay, if they abide stable, Outher of them in tyme of aduersite, Pref thy friende afore, and thou shalt se Whom thow maist trust, thy iournay for to spede; As thow fyndest, so make thyn owne suerte, Whiche of them both, love goth tofore, or mede. 12 Al worldly frenship is straunge and right dyuers. Lete al men trust as they causes fynde; Dede to bihest doth oft the reuers, Theffect in werk goth lame and halt behynde; Of obligacions som sealis ben so blynd That men may neither se the printe ne rede; Thynk thervpon lete it nat out of mynde, Whiche goþ before frenship, money, or mede? 13 The faire behestis maken foolis gladde, Fye on the werk whan hestis ben contrayre! Like to a tre, with fressh blosmes ladde, Whiche that in Aprill so lusti be and fayre; But whan in August folk[es] do repayre To gadre his fruyte, there is none found in dede: Of suche friendis there be mo than a payre, Save with fayre chiere they love nat but for mede. 14 But for to grounde oure love in sikernesse, And sette asyde fraude and decepcioun, Late vs to God al oure wittis dresse Where feyth abydith, and al perfeccioun And perfite love hath his foundacioun: Suche love as wil nat faile his friende at nede, But love for love in the heuenly regioun God yevith to man, for his eternal mede. 15 There men shal fynde ioy and al gladnesse, The love excellyng of Dalida and Sampson, Passe Octovian or Cresus in riches, The love of Phillis or of Demephon; And in fayrenesse transcendyng Absolon; Sette ther your love and ye shul nat myspede That Cite bilt with euery precious ston, Ther for to dwelle for youre eternal mede. 16 Vp to that court now do youre loves dresse, Vnto that gracious gostly mansioun, Whiche that excellith in beaute and brightnes Rome, Cartage, Troye and Ilioun; Of hevenly rubyes bilt is that dongeoun,— God graunt vs grace there oure lyf to lede! And clayme [by] love to have possessioun, With hym for love, that suffre[d] his sides bleede. 17 Who seyth that Amor vincit omnia, He saith ful triew, playnly to expresse, Nought erthely love, whiche with pecunia Sette trouth aside be fraude and doublenesse; But perfite love, whiche hath none interesse To erthly thyngges, neyther in word ne dede; Suche love grounded in love and stablenesse Shal have of God his gwerdoun and his mede. 57.

VERBA TRANSLATORIS. 8 Mong alle thes I counceyl yit take heed, Wher thu abydest or reste in any place, In cheef love God, and with thy love ha dreed, And be feerful ageyn Hym to trespace; With vertuous men encrece shall thy grace, And vicious folk arn cause of gret damage, In every ffelaship so for thysilf purchace, Wher vertu regnyth, ther vttir thy language. 9 Be paied with litel, content with suffisaunce, Clymb nat to hih, thus biddith Socrates; Glad pouert is of tresours moost substaunce, And Catoun seith is noon so greet encres Off wordly tresours, as for to live in pees, Which among vertues hath the vasselage: I take record of Diogenees, Which to Alisaundre had this language. 10 His paleys was a litel poore tonne, Which on a wheel with hym he gan carye, Bad this emperour ride out of his sonne, Which dempt hym-sylf richer than Kyng Darye, Kept with his vessel fro wyndis moost contrarye, Wherin he made daily his passage, This philosophre with pryncys lyst nat tarye, Nor in ther presence to vttre no language. 11 Attwen thes tweyne a greet comparysoun, Kyng Alisaundir he conqueryd al, Diogenes lay in a smal dongoun; Lyke sondry wedrys which turnyd as a bal, Fortune to Alisaundir gaff a sodeyn ffal; The philosophre disposed his coignage, He thouht vertu was moor imperrial Than his acqueyntaunce, with al his proud language. 12 Antonye and Poule dispised al richesse, Lyved in desert of wilful poverte; Sesar and Pompey of marcial woodnesse, By ther envious compassyd cruelte, Twen Germanye and Affryk was gret enmyte; No comparisoun twen good greyn and fforage; Preise every thyng like to his degre; And lyke the audience so vttir thy language. 13 I fond a lyknesse depict vpon a wal, Armed in vertues, as I walk up and doun, The hed of thre ful solempne and roial, Intellectus, Memorye, and Resoun; With eyen and erys of cleer discrecioun, Mouth and tonge avoiden al outrage, Ageyn the vice of fals detraccioun, To do no surfet in woord nor in language. 14 Hand and armys with this discrecioun, Wher-so man have force or ffebilnesse, Trewly to meene in his affeccioun, For fraude or favour to folwe rihtwisnesse; Entrailes inward, devocioun with meeknesse, Passyng Pigmalioun which graued his ymage; Preyd to Venus, of lovers cheef goddesse, To graunt it lyff and quyknesse of language. 15 Of hool entent pray we to Crist Iesu, To quyke a figure in our conscience, Reson as hed, with membris of vertu, Aforn rehersyd breeffly in sentence; Vndir support of his magnificence, Crist so lyst governe our wordly pilgrymage, Tween vice and vertu to sette a difference, To his plesaunce to vttren our language.

Ashmole 59, leaves 35 to 37. 17 stanzas of 8 lines.] Here begynneþe a Polletyke Balade Ryale made by þat approbate Poete Lidegate þe Munk of Burye with þe gode Refrayde, To fynde a freonde at neode. 1 Late whane Aurora of Tytane toke leve, Nought longe agone in a gladde mor[we]nyng, Soole by my self walking in a greve, Goldyne Phebus feyre in chare shyninge, I harde a larke in maner compleyninge, Seying þis refreyde, I toke þer off heede, “Þe worlde is divers, ffortune is chaungyng, Ful weele is him þat fyndeþe a freonde at neede.” 2 Gret noumbre of frendes in prosperitee Whylest fortune sheweþe hir lookes glade; Gret prees of coustume is abowte þe tree, While þat boughes beon with fruytes lade; But whane þe braunches beon bareine and fade Þat he revested is in wynters weede, Fare weele þe prees, þis liknesse þat I made, Is agayne hem þat fayle þeire freonde at neede. 3 Þe ryche man haþe freondes gret plentee, Every wight redy til do him plesaunce. But folke þat beon fallen in pouerte Noman desireþe to haue þeire qweyntance, To þeyme men chaunge chere and contenaunce, Þe poure haþe none to wysse him and to rede, Lat every man have þis in remembraunce It is ful vnkouþe to fynde a freonde at nede. 4 Whilome Horaste was freonde vnto Pilade, Never to part as seyþe Ovydius, In frowarde fortune ne in þeire stoundes glade, So did Achilles and Patreolus, Þe duc Prothee and eke duc Theseus, Þeire thoughtes oone in herte, wille, and dede, Giving ensaumple to prynces vertuous, Howe gret a tresore to fynde a freonde at nede. 5 Kyng Dauid alsoo and freondly Ionathas, Loved as brether voyde of devisyoun, Þey sparde not for daunger nor manasse Ne for al Saulus fel parsecucyoun, Ay to contynue in oone opynyoun, And never dessever for no foreine dede, Texemplefie by short conclusioun Howe muche avayleþe to fynde a frende at nede. 6 Þer is a storye noted in substaunce Of knightes tweyne, Amys and Amylon, As þey were lyke of chere and countenaunce, Of all þeire fayture made none excepcion, Booþe of one porte and one condicion Hole, vndeparted of courage and manhede, As by þere fatal constillacyoun Echeone til oþer feythfull founde at nede. 7 Rethor Tulius, De Amicicia, Hyest of vertues frenship doþe preferre, In þe hevenly courte supra cidera, With gods goddesse caste heos beemis ferre, In whos clere stremis pilgrymes may not erre, What cooste or parte heos lightes for to shede, A precyous tresore founde in pees and werre, A man to fynde a feythful freonde at nede. 8 Þe doctrinal þus writeþe is me tolde Sepe viatorem nona non vetus orbita fallit. Þereinne concludeþe pleinly by sentence, For nuwe knowelegge chaunge not þy freondes alde. Straunge bypathes doone offt gret offence, Til vnkouþe folke þat fayle exparience Vnto what parte þat pathe doþe hem lede, By whiche ensaumple gif to my worde credence, Kepe wele þat freonde þat wil not fayle at neede. 9 Þeos stately freondes boþe of worde and chere, Salmon calþe hem felawes at þe table, As at feestis at dyners and sowpere, With feyre byhestis as þey were vaillable, But at þe point, adieux, al nys but fable, Save worde and wynde conclusion of þeire crede, As weþercok þeire faites beo founde vnstable, Yitte wele is him þat fyndeþe a freonde at nede. 10 And who þat haþe his feithfull freonde ef wonne Vndesseuered þeire hertis knitte in feere Tulius seyþe, þeire frenship is lyche sunne, Whane it sitte hyest in þe midday spere Þat wyndy clowdes approchen man no nere, Nothing but cleer heos bemys ay sprede, Þeire frenship wol not twynne in no manere, For lyff nor deþe to fayle his freonde at nede. 11 By þe counseyle of prudent Salamon, Si possides amicum in temptaccione posside ipsum. Yif þou of freondes make elleccion By gode avyse cheese þee vnto such one, Preved and expert of olde affeccion, And whane þou haste of him pocession, Þane for no nuwe þou chaunge him I þee rede, Of golde of tresore make no comparisoun, To him þat wil not fayle his freonde at nede. 12 Þere ben eke freondes founden for a tyme Est amicus secundum tempus. Wheche þat endure but a smal saysoun, Of whiche chaunge is aye þe nuwe pryme, Stoundemele diuers off entencion, Gerisshe, stormisshe of entencion, Liche march weder, let noman take hede, Preyse as þou fyndest in þyne opynioun, And chese þy freonde þat wol not fayle at neode. 13 Þe sone of Syrake called was Ihesus, Est amicus nomine. Whiche in heos dytes hade so gret a fame, Seþe þere beo freondes of langage glorious Þeire worde and worke not lyke who list atame For hem he callþe freonde but of name, Þeire heestis suspecte, deperted is þeire wede, But þey of frenship bere but þe surname, Be no fals feynier, þat faileþe freonde at nede. 14 Alle one to me þat freonde þat doþe no gode, Nota per Shirley. And þat enemye þat doþe me no damage, As Ianus Byfronus twoo faces in oone hode Byhinde and fore double of þeire vysage, Peyse yee hem boþe with footeles avauntage, Oone countrepeyse þeire love and þeire haterede, A smal destinccion sette in þeire ymage, Þeire trust, þeire hate conclude all one at nede. 15 Þere beon freondfull freondes in wele and woo, And ever elych[e] truwe in þeire entent, And þere beo freondes, Salamon seyþe eke soo, Feyning, flatering, fals, and fraudelente, And some beo double of entendement, Þat flourisshe and floure, but þei do not feede, Of whome I may conclude in sentement, Alle suche wol fayle þeire freonde at his neode. 16 Blessed þis man þat dooþe his freonde socour, Him to support at neode frome his mescheef, Incomporable to golde or suche tresore, Bavme or tryacle agenst alkyns greef, Of pryce no charboncle ne perlle is so cheef, Who fynþe suche one, amisse he may not spede, He may beo marked and trusted, I let you leve, As for to fynde so feythfull freonde at neode. 17 O Cryste Ihesu, whos frenship may not fayle, For love of man þat suffred passyoun, And with Golye þat heldest gret battayle, Oure Dauid þat sloughe bere and lyoun, Oure Moyses, oure Gedeon, oure Sampson, On Calvarie þat list for vs to blede For Maries sake be oure proteccion And helpe alle þoo þat calne þee at þeire nede. 59. A DITTY UPON HASTE. From Camb. Univ. Lib., MS. KK. 1. 6, leaves 205, back, to 208, back.] Here enduth the songe on þis worde / Who sueth vertu, vertu schall he leere / And begyneth the dite on þis worde He hasteth weel þat wysely can abyde. 1 Alle haste is odious, where as discression Off wylfulnesse hath non int[e]resse, And sodeyne rauncour oppressed hath reson, And extort power rebukyd ri?twisenesse, Nameli when fraude, flateri, &amp; ffalsenesse Geyne consience haue trouth[e] sette aside, Afforne providid all surfetys to represse; He hastuth weele þat wysely can abyde. 2 The hasti man ffayleth neuer woo, Haste contrarious enemy to sadnesse, And wylful haste to wisdam gretteste foo, Mortal espie, tretour to soburnesse, Cheef of counsell to ffurius dronkenesse, Spor of vengaunce whan woode man lyste ride, In eueri mater Salamon bereth wittenesse, He hasteth weele þat wyseli can abyde. 3 Geyne foltysche haste without avisinesse, Whan out of counsell exiled is prudence, What folewuth aftur but rancour &amp; rudenesse? Lak of thre mirrouris longyng to prouydence Of tyme passed, ffutur &amp; presence, Grounde of all damage for wantyng of a gyde, To ffolewe þe councell of parfite pacyence, He hastuth wele þat wysely can abyde. 4 Haste ageyne reson requireth repentaunce, Haste vnavysed braydeth on neclygence, Haste puttuth al counseyle in distemperaunce, Hasty report &amp; hasti false credence, Hasti mevyng &amp; hasti violence, In þem þat lyste not afforne provyde For to remembre in þer advertence He hastuth wele þat wysely can abyde. 5 Proverbiorum, Salamon speketh of thre, Alle were to hasti &amp; noon of hem was good, The ffyrste of them of ffurious cruelte Was of kynde hasty to scheede bloode, As whylom Cayme geyne Abel was to wood For he in his offeryng lyste ry?tfully devide, Cayme accursed Abel in grace stood, He hastuth wele þat wysely can abyde. 6 Off a nother Salamon bereth wyttenesse, Whech [hastith] faste toward his heritage, Of coveytyse to gedre grete richesse, In hope þerby to gete grete avauntage He maketh his god of tresour &amp; coygnage What ffolewuth aftur, the schippes seyle wyde, Such folke alday dye or þer myddyll age, He hastuth wele þat wysely can abyde. 7 Tryste is not best þat cometh afforne his tyme, Ner hasty clymbynge to grete possession. Nexte Phebus vpryste þe next oure is prime, And mydday folewuth by iyste succession. Caste weel þyn houres by revolucyoun, Dethys horlage wul not passe his tyde, Be-war þat complyne, preferre not his sesoun, He hastuth wele þat wysely can abyde. 8 Hasty blosomes a sodeyne wynde doth [shake] The seluer deuh a-morewe clere schynynge Wyth bryght bemes of Tytan been vptake, Or heete of mydmorewe þe mystis doth doun brynge, And þus his ffareth by hasty vp clymbynge, Sodeyne rysynge doth sodeynly doun slyde, Take þe moralite vpon þis worde thynkynge, He hastuth weel þat wysely can abyde. 9 At prime-tens, men seen hit wel at ye, Hasty ffrutus haue no longe resydens, Ryght feyre outward þe coore doth putrifye, Dayly perceyuyd of olde experyence; Clymbyng of beggers to worldely excellence, Namely in chyldehood discression set asyde, What folewuth þerof? Al such false apparence Though hit schyne outwarde, hit wyl no while abyde. 10 Eche thyng is beeste take in his sesoun, Thend of Auguste disposeth his ventagys, Caneculer dayes bryng home venyson, In May &amp; Iune bryddys synge in cagys, Corn at hervest is brought home by cariagys, Off hey moneth Iule hath set þe tyde, In temperat weder men goon on pylgrymagis, He hastuth well þat wysely can abyde. 11 Asael was hasti of rennyng, More swyft of cours than outher hert or hynde, Lyste not take of Abner the warnyng, Sleyne for his hast In Regum as y ffynde, Troian stori of Patroclus maketh mynde, When he for hast geyne Hector wolde ryde, Off presumpcyon his yen were to blynde He hastuth weel þat wesely can abyde. 12 Furius hast made Hector lese his lyff Of hateful yre, for he ?aff no credense Vnto þe dreme of his notable wyff, Causyng his deth by fatall influence, Troyus champyoun cheff wall of þer defence, Geyne Iunoos bydyng allas, why wolde he ryde? Geyne Parchas sustren is made no resistence, He hastuth weele þat wysely can abyde. 13 Achylles spere vnwarly made hym bleede, Perced his hert, þe heed was whette so keene, Fortune quyt hym, ther stoory who lyste reede, For haste he hadde toward Pollycene, His deth compasyd by Ercula þe Queene, To-fforn Appollo amyd þer templus wyde That deth for deth departed þem betweene, He hastuth weel þat wysely can abyde. 14 Hasty sechyng &amp; rauaschyng of Heleyne, Whan Paris ryued vp at Citheron, Maade Erles mortally dysdeyne, Geyne Troians leyde siege to þer towne, Looste ther relyquyt called Palladyon, Froward cheer offeryng to Venes &amp; Cupide, Causyng the brennyng of ryche Ylion, He hastuth weel þat wysely can abyde. 15 The amerous haste of Philles who lyste see, For longe abydyng of proude Demophon, Maade sche was turned to a philbert tree, And bare philbertis passyng grete ffuson. Hasti desyris, wyfly affeccion, Off Penolape recorde of Ovide, For Vluxes fyl ofte sithes downe, He hastuth weel þat wysely can abyde. 16 The hasti werres &amp; þe ffurious rage Atwyxe þe tweyne ffamous myghti touns. Atwene þe Romaynes &amp; cite of Cartage, Caused in Auffryk grete desolacyouns, Deth &amp; distruccyon of thre Scipions, Tytus Lyuyus þer trivmphus wyl not hyde, Concludyng thus monge all condicions, That haste is beeste which wysely can abyde. 17 Euer be war of hasti ffrowarde speche, Kepe close þy tonge from rekeles langage, Geyn hurt of tonges harde to fynde a leche, Contraryous wynde of mouth doth grete damage; Swyft of wynge sclaunder doth his message, And frowarde ffame splayeth his ffly?t ful wyde. Good report is best in eueri age, And haste is best þat wysely can abyde. 18 That hast is good wheche hastuth to vertue, And slouthe is good þat vengaunce doth differre. Best of all hastus is haste towarde Ihesu, Haste hym to serue for suche haste may not erre, Criste brought [in] pees, Sathan brought in werre, Pursewe for pees, &amp; late pees be þy gyde, Lette parfyte cherite be þy loode sterre, Suche haste is beste who can þer-on abyde. 19 In wykkyd haste was neuer founde speede, Slouth to be vengid, men seyne such slouth is good, Haste to Criste Ihesu meynt with loue &amp; dreede, Wyth remembraunce he starff apon þe Rood, And for mankynde spent his presyous blood, Wyth a scharpe spere persyng thourgh his syde, To vynqusche Sathan no scheltron is so good, As Cristus Passion who can þer on abyde. 20 Lerne in ?outh to proffyte in vertu, Thyn[g]e take in ?outh hath good impression, A goode begynnynge requireth a good issu, A good preamble a good conclusyon, For vertuous lyff vertuous gwerdon, His bryght bemes vertu can not hyde; Haste in all perylys to Cristus Passion, Embrace þat baner, &amp; do þer-by a-byde. Explicit quod Lydgate. 60. LOOK IN THY MEROUR, AND DEEME NOON OTHIR WIGHT. [From MS. Harl. 2255, leaves 7, back, to 11, back.] 1 Toward the eende of ffroosty Ianuarye, Whan watry Phebus had his purpoos take For a sesoun to sojourne in Aquarye, And Capricorn hadde vttirly forsake, Toward Aurora a-morwe as I gan wake A feldefare ful eerly took hir fliht, To fore my study sang with hir fetheris blake: “Look in thy merour and deeme noon othir wiht.” 2 Thouh the Pecok haue wengys briht and sheene, Grauntyd be nature to his gret avayl, With gold and azour and emeroudis grene, And Argus eyen portrayed in his tayl, Berth up his fethrys displayed like a sayl,— Toward his feet whan he cast doun his sight, Tabate his pryde ther is no bet counsayll;— Look in thy merour and deeme noon othir wiht. 3 The kyng of ffoulys moost imperyal, Which with his look percith the fervent sonne, The Egle, as cheef of nature moost roial, As oolde clerkys weel devise konne; To Phebus paleys by flight whan he hath wonne, What folwith aftir for al his gret[e] myght?

Harley, 2251, leaves 28, back, to 29, back.] 1 By witte of man al thyng that is contryved, Standith in proporcioun, plainly to conclude, In old auctours lyke as it is discryved, Whether it be depnesse or longitude, Cast out by compas of height or latitude, By peyse, by nombre, tryed out by equite, To voyde al errour fro folkis that ben rude, Nothyng commendyd but it in mesure be. 2 Mesours of musyk bene the spieris nyne, Mevid by mesure with hevenly armony; Lower in erth compas, squyer, and lyne, Voyde al errours cause of geometrye; Sownyng of instrumentis, concorde of mynstralcye, Sette full and hoole be perfite vnite; Swetnesse of mesure causith al melodye, By perfit musyk if it in mesure be. 3 Without mesure may non artificere In his wirkyng parfitely procede, Peyntour, steynour, mason, nor carpentere, Without mesure accomplissh nat in dede; Where mesure fayleth, wrong wrought is euery dede, Of thyng to longe the superfluite Mesure cutte of, and thus who can take heede, Iche thyng is praysed if it in mesure be. 4 Whan mesure faileth in dome or iugement, Rightwisnes is tourned to woodenesse, A rigurous iuge, a foltissh president, With hate and rancour doth his vertu dresse; Vengeaunce by envye theyre reason doth oppresse; Whan they ben blynde and can no mesure se, False rooted malice and cruel wilfulnesse, Wil suffre no mesure in theyr court to be. 5 [A crownyd asse rude, that can no goode, That wylle play a countarffetyd lyon, And he allso that is a cherll of blode Brought vp of naght vnto dominacion; A Scottysche hare lyke to a fell gryffon, The lyknesse made contraryous of degre, In theyr accord is no conuencion, Nor in ther meethyng ther may no mesure be.] 6 An olde prouerbe, mesour is tresoure, Where mesure faileth is disconuenience; In rethorik stant no parfite colour, But if it be conveyed by cadence, If mesure lak, what vailith eloquence? Concludyng thus [how] the souerante, Of euery craft and of eche scyence, Receyvith his price, if it in mesure be. 7 [Who that presumythe to make in mytar or prose, Or to accomplyshe matters of poetry, Withe-oute mesure to endyte texte or glose, Or usyth his tonge in truthe or flaterye, Oute of mesur, for to say sooth or ly, Whan over-mykile is, and grett scarsete, A mene is best eche man his witt to plye What-evar he doo, that it in mesure be.] 8 [Temperyd by mesur is every medysyn, Proporcion sent unto the Apotecarie, Helthe Recuryd, folowynge the doctryne Ypocras set in his diatary, Surfatt to mesure is noyous and contrarie, Wher-by is causyd grett in-fermyte, In this mattar what sholde I longar tarye, Wher mesure reygnyth, ther may non exses be.] 9 Where mesure reygnith, subgettis lyve in peas; Roote of discorde is froward tyrannye: Favour in mesure causith grete incres, And out of mesure it causith grete envye. Men must by mesour rigour modifye, Atwixt love and hate mesure doth equyte; Wherfor late souerayns vse this policye, What-euer they do late it in mesure be. 10 Lete men be mesure werk other travaile, Mesoure biddith men do none outrages; And he that euer of mesure takith counsaile, Can nat shewe in one hoode two visages. The coke by mesour sesonyth his potages, A temperat hete egall in oone degre, By decoccioun to take theyr avauntages, Aforn provyded that al in mesure be. 11 Disport with labour among is necessary; Travaile requyrith a recreacioun; Pees and werre ben thynges ful contrary: Mesure of eueriche grauntith his season; Chaunge and diuersite of complexioun In sundry agees set aduersite, Nat to glad ne to hevy of condicioun, But al is wele so it in mesure be. 12 That [play] is goode that causith no damage, Honest disport that causith none hyndryng. Blessid of God is also that langage, That kepith his tunge fro froward bakbytyng; And blessid is he that saith wele of al thyng, And blissed is he whiche in his pouerte, List thank God, voyde of al grucchyng, And doth nothyng but it in mesure be. 13 Late euery man wisely aduertise, He shal agayne receyve suche mesoure, By egal peyse and in the same wise, So as he weyeth vn-to his neyghboure; Be it of hate, fauour, or rancoure; The gospel tellith, lerne this of me, So as thow weyest be mercy or rigoure, The mesure same shal be don to the. 62.

The stoon of paradys was ffyn of his labour, In al his conquest, haue ye wel in mynde, Was sett ferre bak for lak of iust mesure. 6 Knyghthood in Grece and Troye the Cite Took hys principlys, and next in Rome toun, And in Cartage, a famous greet cuntre, Recoord of Hanybal and wourthy Scipioun; The greete debaatys and the divisioun Among these kyngdammys by marcial labour, Fynal cause of ther destruccioun, Was fawte of vertu and lakkyng of mesure. 7 To knyghthood longith the Chirche to suppoorte, Wydewys, and maydenys, and poore folke to diffende, Men in ther ryght knyghtly to recoumfoorte, To comoun profight nyght and day entende, Ther lyff, ther good manly to dispende, To punysshe extorcioun, raveyne, and ech robbour, And brynge[n] alle vnto correccioun, That be froward vnto the iust mesour. 8 Trewe iuges and sergeauntis of the lawe, For hate or frenshippe they shal ther doomys dresse, With-oute excepcioun, and ther hand with-drawe, Fro meede and yifftes alle surffetys to represse; Holde trouthe and sustene rightwisnesse, Mercy preferre alwey to-for rigour, That fals for-sweryng haue there noon interesse, For lak of trouthe and lak of iust mesour. 9 So egally ther doomys to avaunce, Of God and trouthe alwey to takyn hede, And Cambises to haue in remembraunce, That was slayn be-cause that he took meede Of poore folk, the causys they shall speede, To moordre nor theffte they shal doo no favour, In al ther doomys of conscience to dreede, That ryght goo not bak, equite, nor mesour. 10 Meyris, sherevys, aldirmen, cunstablys, Which that governe bourghes and citees, Kepith your fraunchise and statutys profitablys, That moost avaylle may to the Comountees; In no wise lese nought your libertees, Accorde ech man with his trewe neyhbour, As ye ar bounde to hih and lowh degrees, That peys and wheyghte be kept, and iust mesour. 11 A-mong yoursilf suffre noon extorcioun, Let no wrong be doo vnto the poraylle, On theffte and manslaughte doo execucioun, Beth weel providid for stuff and for vitaylle; Let no devisioun, Salamon doth counsaylle, With-inne your-silf holde no socour; And for a tresour which greetly may avaylle, Among alle thyng kepe peys and iust mesour. 12 Famous marchauntys, that ferre cuntrees ryde, With al ther greete rychesse and wynnynges, And artificerys, that at hom abyde, So ferre castyng in many sundry thynges, And been expert in wondirful konnyngges, Of dyvers crafftys tavoyden al errour; What may avaylle al your ymagynynges, Withoute proporciouns of weyghte and iust mesour? 13 Rekne vp phesyk with all ther letuaryes, Grocerys, mercerys, with ther greet habundaunce, Expert surgeyns, prudent potecaryes, And all ther weyghtes peysed in ballaunce, Masouns, Carpenterys, of Yngelond and of Fraunce, Bakerys, browsterys, vyntenerys, with fressh lycour, All set at nought to rekne in substaunce, Yiff peys or weyghte doo lakke, or iust mesour. 14 Ploughmen, carterys, with othir laborerys, Dichers, delverys, that greet travaylle endure, Which bern vp all, and haue doon many yeerys, The staatis alle set here in portrature, On Goddys wyll, and also by nature, Alle oon ymage diuers in ther degree, Shulde be alle oon, by recoord of Scripture, Be large mesour of parfight charyte. 15 Fro yeer to yeer thexperience is seyn, Ne were the plough no staat myght endure; The large feeldys shulde be bareyn, No corn vp-growe nor greyn in his verdure, Man to suppoorte, nor beeste in his nature, For which we shulde of trouthe for our socour Wourshippe the plough, sithe euery creature Hath of the ploughman his lyffloode be mesour. 16 So as the shepperde wacchith vpon ther sheep, The hoote somyr, the coolde wynterys nyght, Spiritual heerdys shulde take keep In Crystes foolde, with al ther ful[le] myght, By vertuous doctryne as they ar holde of ryght, To save ther sogettys fro wolvys fell rygour, That heretikys quenche nat the lyght Of Crystes feith nor of iust mesour. 17 Heerdys with sheep shul walke in good pasture, And toward nyght sewrly sette a foolde, Of Isaac and Iacob a ful pleyn figure, That wer shepperdws whyloom be dayes oolde; Which lyk prelatys and bysshoppes as I toolde, Thestaatys here sett in charyte shal governe, By good exaumple in heete and froostys coolde, That ryght and mesure shal holde vp the lanterne. 18 Strong as Herculees of manhood &amp; of myght, I am set here to stondyn at dyffence, Wrong to represse, and to suppoorte ryght. With this burdoun of sturdy violence; But vnto alle that wyl doo reuerence, To alle the staatys sett here in portrature, I shall to hem make no resistence, That be gouernyd iustly be mesure. 19 Among boorys, beerys, and leounnys, Myn office is to walke in wyldirnesse, Reste a-nyght in cavys and dongeounnys, Tyl Phebus shewe a-morwen his bryghtnesse Now stonde I here to kepe in sekirnesse This hows in sewyrte, with al my besy cure, To letyn in folk, that of gentilnesse Lyst hem governe iustly be measure.

Harley 2255, leaves 3, back, to 5, back.] 1 Lat no man booste of konnyng nor vertu, Off tresour, richesse, nor of sapience, Off wordly support, for al comyth of Ihesu Counsayl, confort, discrecioun, and prudence, Prouisioun, forsight, and providence, Like as the Lord of grace list dispoose; Somman hath wisdam, somman hath elloquence, Al stant on chaung, lyke a mydsomyr roose. 2 Holsom in smellyng be the soote fflourys, Ful delitable outward to the sight; The thorn is sharp, curyd with fressh colouris, Al is nat gold that outward shewith bright; A stokfyssh boon in dirknesse yevith a light, Twen ffair and foul, as God list dispoose,— A difference atwix[en] day and nyght, Al stant on chaung, lyke a mydsomyr roose. 3 Floures open vpon euery grene, Whan the larke, messager of day, Salueth the vprist of the sonne shene Moost amerously in Apryl and in May, And Aurora, ageyn the morwe gray, Causith the dayeseye hir crowne to vncloose; Worldly gladnesse is medlyd with affray, Al stant on chaung, like a mydsomyr roose. 4 Atwen the cokkow and the nightyngale Ther is a maner straunge difference. On fressh braunchys syngith the woode-wale; Iayes in musyk haue smal experyence, Chateryng pyes whan they come in presence, Moost malapert ther verdite to purpoose, Al thyng hath favour breffly in sentence, Off soffte or sharp, lyke a mydsomyr roose. 5 The roial lioun leete calle a parlement, Alle beestys abowte hym enviroun, The wolff of malys, beyng ther present, Vpon the lamb compleyned, ageyn resoun; Said he maad his watir vnholsom, His tendir stomak to hyndre and vndespoose; Raveynours reigne, the innocent is bore doun, Al stant on chaung, lyk a mydsomer roose. 6 Al wordly thyng braydeth vpon tyme, The sonne chaungith, so doth the pale moone, The aureat noumbre in kalenderys set for prime, Fortune is double, doth favour for no boone, And who that hath with that queen to doone, Contrariously she wyl his chaunce dispoose. Who sittith hihest moost like to falle soone, Al stant on chaung, like a mydsomyr roose. 7 The goldene chaar of Phebus in the hayr, Chasith mystes blake, that day dar not appeere, At whos vprist mounteyns be made so fayr As they were newly gilt with his beemys cleere; The nyht doth folwe, appallith al his cheere, Whan westerne wawes his streemys ouer-cloose, Rekne al bewte, al fresshnesse that is heere, Al stant on chaung, lyke a mydsomyr roose. 8 Constreynt of coold makith flours dare With wyntir froostis, that they dar nat appeere. Al clad in russet the soyl of greene is bare, Tellus and Imo be dullyd of ther cheere By revolucioun and turnyng of the yeere, As gery March his stoundys doth discloose, Now reyn, now storm, now Phebus bright &amp; cleere, Al stant on chaung like a mydsomyr roose. 9 Wher is now Dauid, the moost worthy kyng Of Iuda and Israel, moost famous and notable? And wher is Salomon moost souereyn of konnyng, Richest of bildyng, of tresour incomparable? Face of Absolon, moost fair, moost amyable, Rekne vp echon, of trouthe make no gloose, Rekne vp Ionathas, of frenship immutable, Al stant on chaung lyke a mydsomyr roose. 10 Wher is Iulius, proudest in his empyre, With his tryumphes moost imperyal? Wher is Pirrus, that was lord and sire Of Ynde in his estat roial? And wher is Alisaundir that conqueryd al? Failed leiser his testament to dispoose. Nabugodonosor or Sardonapal? Al stant on chaung like a mydsomyr roose. 11 Wher is Tullius, with his sugryd tonge? Or Crisistomus, with his goldene mouth? The aureat ditees that be red and songe Of Omerus, in Grece both north and south? The tragedyes divers and vnkouth Of moral Senek, the mysteryes to vncloose? By many example this mateer is ful kouth, Al stant on chaung like a mydsomyr roose. 12 Wher been of Fraunce al the dozepeers, Which in Gawle hadde the governaunce? Vowes of the Pecok, with al ther proude cheers? The worthy nyne with al ther hih bobbaunce? Troian knyhtis, grettest of alliaunce? The fflees of gold, conqueryd in Colchoos? Rome and Cartage, moost souereyn of puissaunce? Al stant on chaung, like a mydsomyr roos. 13 Put in a som al marcial policye, Compleet in Affryk and boundys of Cartage, The Theban legioun example of cheualrye, At Rodamus Ryuer was expert ther corage, Ten thousand knyhtes born of hih parage, Ther martirdam, rad in metre and proose, Ther goldene crownys, maad in the heuenly stage, Fressher than lilies, or ony somyr roose. 14 The remembraunce of euery famous knyht, Ground considerid, is bilt on rihtwisnesse. Race out ech quarel that is not bilt on riht; Withoute trouthe, what vaileth hih noblesse? Lawrer of martirs foundid on hoolynesse,— Whit was maad red, ther tryumphes to discloose. The whit lillye was ther chaast clennesse, Ther bloody suffraunce was no somyr roose. 15 It was the Roose of the bloody feeld, Roose of Iericho, that greuh in Beedlem; The five Roosys portrayed in the sheeld, Splayed in the baneer at Ierusalem.

The next sustir in ordre, as I can nevene, Was Pacience, which put hir silf in prees, And moost was besy of alle the sustryn sevene Folk at discoord to settyn hem in pees. 12 Gaudium in Spiritu to reiosshe euery wrong, For Cristes comyng among her sustrys alle, With a glad spirit this was hir newe song, Gaudete in Domino, born in an oxis stalle, A newe myracle in Bedleem is now falle, Kyng Dauid-is heir mong prophetis perlees, Shal at Ierusalem in that royal halle As lord of lordys callyd souereyn lord of pees. 13 In thes seven sustryn was no divisioun Cheef of ther consayl wac Humylitas, Content with litel was Discrecioun, Moost meke of alle was Leta Paupertas, Alle of accord, cause that Benignitas Set governaunce, that none was reklees, Of cardinal vertues perfecta societas, What-evir they wrouhte, concludid vpon pees. 14 Thes sustryn alle, pacient and pesible, Lyk ther princesse, moost fayr, moost gracious, Callyd Maria, as ferre as was posible Fulfilled with vertues she was moost plentevous, Queen of Hevene lay in a symple hous, A poore stable mong beestys rewleless An oxe, an asse, no courseers costious, In a streiht rakke lay ther the Kyng of Pees. 15 At Cristes birthe, as I reherse can, This pees cam in almoost at merk mydnyht, Tyme of thempyre of Octovian, Whan Sibile cast hir look vpriht Toward the Orient, and sauh an auhteer briht Callyd Ara Celi, of beute peerlees, Theron an empresse, moost fayr of face and siht, A child in hir armys, callyd cheef Lord of Pees. 16 This pees of grace long while did endure, Tyme that iij. kynges wer conveyd with the sterre, Tyl Herodes, of froward aventure, Geyn Ihesus by malys gan a werre, Sent his knyhtes both[e] nyh and ferre, Slouh Innocentys, of malys giltlees, In Bedleem boundys this Tyraunt list so erre, Ageyn the prynce callyd souereyn Lord of Pees. 17 This Herodis, tiraunt ful of pryde, In his malys surquedous and cruel, Thoruh alle the citees that stood there be-syde, Slouh alle the childre, geyn Crist he was so fel; Of compassioun moost pitously Rachel Wepte whan she sauh the knyhtes mercilees, Slouh so hir childre, born in Israel, For his sake souereyn Lord of Pees. 18 Ther be figures dolorous of pite, Of fals tyrauntes vengable to do wraak, Caym slouh Abel for his gret equite, Attwen Ismael was stryff and Isaak, Esaw wolde haue founde a laak Cause that Iacob was put out of prees, By Rebecca a while set a-baak, Atwen the brethre, tyl ther wer maad a pees. 19 The Apocalips remembryd of seyn Iohn, In his avisiouns the Ewangelist took heede, With a sharp swerd he sauh ridyng Oon, Fers and proudly vpon a poleyn steede, Of colour reed, his iourne for to speede, By his array vengable and reklees, Whos power was bothe in lengthe and breede To make werre and distroye pees. 20 His swerd wex bloody in the mortal werre, Attween Grekys and them of Troye toun, Gan spreede abrood, bothe nyh and ferre, Thebes aforn brouht to destruccioun, Kyng Alisaundre put Darye doun, In Perce and Meede, the crowne whan he chees, Vowes of the Pecok, the Frenssh makith mencioun, Pryde of the werrys moost contrary vnto pees. 21 Othir werrys, that were of latter age, Afftir Ierusaleem and gret Babiloon, Werrys attween Roome and Cartage Of thre Scipiouns, moost souereyn of renoun, Rekne Hanybal, the proude champioun, Brak Rome wallys, furyous and reklees, At the laste stranglyd with poisoun, Of marcial ire koude lyve nevir in pees. 22 Al werre is dreedful, vertuous pees is good, Striff is hatful, pees douhtir of plesaunce, In Charlys tyme ther was shad gret blood, God sende vs pees twen Ynglond and Fraunce; Werre causith povert, pees causith habundaunce, And attween bothen for ther moor encrees, Withoute feynyng, fraude, or varyaunce, Twen al Cristene Crist Ihesus send vs pees. 23 The Fifte Herry preevyd a good knyht, By his prowesse and noble chivalrye, Sparyd nat to pursue his riht, His title of Fraunce and of Normandye, Deyed in his conquest, and we shall alle dye, God graunt vs alle, now aftir his discees, To sende vs grace attween ech partye, By loue and charyte, to live in parfiht pees: 24 Criste cam with pees at his Natiuite, Pees songe of angelis for gladnesse in Bedleem, And of his mercy to make vs alle fre, He suffryd deth at Ierusaleem, The day wex dirk, the sonne lost his beem, The theef to Paradys by mercy gan in prees, Gladdest kalendis to euery Cristen reem, For vs to come to evir-lastyng pees.

Harl. 2251, leaves 26 to 27.] 1 All thyng in kynde desirith thyng i-like, But the contrary hatis euery thyng, Save only mankynd can neuer wele lyke, Without he have a volumus livyng, Flesshly desire, and gostly norisshyng, In oone persone can neuer be wrought, Fuyre and water, to-gyder al brennyng, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 2 A man that vsith to serve lordis twayne, The whiche holdith contrary to oone oppynioun, To please hem both, and serve no disdayne, And to be triewe, without touche of treasoun, Now to talk with that oon, and with that other rowne, To telle hym a thyng that neuer was [i]-wrought, And to bryng this to a goode conclusioun, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 3 A myghti kyng, a pore regioun, An hasty hede, a comunalte nat wise, Mikel almes-dede and false extorcioun, Knyghtly manhod, and shameful cowardise, An hevenly hevene, a peyneful paradise, A chast doctryne with a false thought, First don on heede, and sithen witte to wise, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 4 Freely to spende and to folwe covetise, To se burgyons on a dede drye stok, A gay temple withoute divyne service, A byrdles cage, a key withouten lok, A tombe shyppe alway ridyng on a rok, A riche bisshop convauncyd with right noght; And to bryng this to a goode It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought, 5 To have a galle, and be clepid a douffe, To be my friend, and gyve me false counsaile, To breke myn hede, and yeve me an houffe, To ben a prist, and fight in eche bataile, To lye in bedde, and a strong castel to assaile, To be a merchaunt, where nothyng may be bought, To have a wyf with a fikel tayle, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 6 A prowde hert in a beggers brest, A fowle visage with gay temples of atyre, Horrible othes with an holy prist, A iustice of iuges to selle and lete to hyre, A knave to comande and have an empire, To yeve a iugement of that neuer was wrought, To preche of pees and sette eche man on fyre, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 7 A leche to thryve where none is sore ne sike, An instrument of musyk withouten a sown, A scorpion to be both mylde and meke, A cloyster man euer rennyng in the towne, First to kille and sith to graunt pardoun, To yeve a stone to hem that of brede the besought, To make a shippard of a wielde lyoun, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 8 A lewde wrecche to were a skarlet gowne, With blac lamb furre without purfile of sable, A goode huswyf alwey rennyng in towne, A chield to thryve that is vnchastisable, But euer inconstaunte and lightly chaungeable, To make moche of them that neuer wol be [o]ught, And take a Rome Renner without a lesyng fable, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 9 Religioun men alway wonnyng in the court, Also curatis evil ther children to love, To be forsworn they hold it but a bord, God to serve and with the fiende to beleve, The riche man cherissith the poore to robbe and reve, Hym to disseyve that of trust the besought, To hele dede men with gresse on the greve, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 10 To do reddour alwey without grace or mercy, A powche ful of straw, a prowde purs penyles, Trew tayled land ayenst the right to bye, A blynde borne man to pley wele at chesse, First to dyne and after go to messe, A chield without noryce to be vpbrought, To kepe trewe weight and selle peper by gesse, It may wele ryme, but it accordith nought. 11 Now almighti God, sith it is as thow wost, Among mankynd made suche variaunce, Send downe thy sonde from the Holi Gost, And festen in vs love and concordaunce; And with suche dedis, Lord, thow vs avaunce, That we be neuer streyned with worme nor mought, And bryng vs al to thyn enheritaunce, With thi precious bloode, as thow vs bought. 66. SAY THE BEST, AND NEVER REPENT. [MS. Bodl. Laud 598, leaves 49 to 49, back.] [Ballade.] 1 Who seith the best shal neuer repent, A vertu callid of full grete reuerens; For euery wiseman, to saue hym from reprefe, Doth kepe his tong fful couert in scilens; And men that bith most expert in prudens Seyn of old tyme, that “tong brekith boone,” Of his nature, “though he hymself haue none.” 2 Crokid langage is a ful perilous thefe, Robbith the fame of vertuous innocens, Take the darnel and cast corn fro the sheffe, Sugurat gall with aureat eloquens, Noise of disslaunder is wers þan pestilens, Which comyth of tonges as men se mo þan oon, And brekyth bonys though he hymself haue none. 3 Hit were bettir he fed hym on raw [befe], Than with his slaundir mortal violens, So for to sett his venym at a prefe, To hurt a man which is not in presens, And faile treacle to make resistens; Ageyn such tonges as persse vnto þe boone, Of their nature, þou þei hamself haue none. 4 Of vice? al, to seyn euyl is the chef, That maybe told or rekenyd in sentens, For cankerid mouthis doth most mortal grefe, Namly when prince? list to yeue hem audiens, For slaughtyr of sword doth not so grete offens As mordir of tonges, expert of yore agone, For he brekith bonys though he himself haue none. 5 He gaderith vp the vicious relefe Of menne? maners be froward diligens, Disseuerith frendship of folk þat were most lefe, And cuttith asondir theire old benevolens, For ech fals tong hath þis, of experiens, Ageyn eche vertu to abutt anoone, Thus brekith he bonys, and hymself hath none. [Text.] 6 When the siluer dewe? sote From the heuyn down gan still To bryng the bawme oute of the rote, Aftyr kalendes of Aprill, Within a park I found a bill Vndir a bank beside a bent, Directid to folk þat lyst speke yll, “Who seith the best shall neuer repent.” 7 To sey the best, hit greuyth nought, Both of folkes hiegh and low, Lete the trouth be first out sought, And deme no man till þou hym know; Among good greyn no cockill sow To peyr no man in thyn entent, A foole hath redy bent his bow To shete his bolt, till he repent. 8 For in this world þer is no man, Where so a man to list fer sech, Nor so vertuous no woman, But may be hynderid be cursid spech Venym of tung doth grete wrech, And al þat euer þer-to assent, For with þis lesson I wil hym tech, “Who seith the best shal neuer repent.” 9 Alas, fals conspiracion, Hath hynderid many a creature, Vnkynd subplantacion, Who may the sore ther-of endure? The wound ther-of hath no mesure, Hit perssith deppir þan doth a tent, Take heed, therfore, to this scripture, “Who seith the best shal neuer repent.” 10 A word, when hit is onys i-spooke, May not be callid ayen of new; When tonges arn to wyde vnlooke, Hit makith many man to rew. Theire spech is clad in dowbill hwe To compace thynges þat neuer was ment, Thei slaundir falsly folkes trew, Ho seith the best shal neuer repent. 11 Most perilous hurt þat is on lyue As inward smytyng at the bak, A bacbiter for to discryue Behynd folk he doth most wrak. On folk absent he settith a bak, Of such as be most innocent; Of lesinges so i-stuffid is his sak, That folkes welfare he doth repent. 12 And tho tunges be most to wite That for suger yeuyn gall Ageyn good wol hamself delite To sey the worst in boure and hall, And to eclipsyn and apall Ech thyng be appeyrment Therfore I sey to one and all Who seith þe best shal neuer repent. 13 Caton writith þat good tung Of vertuous hath the first price, No man may stop whan thei be rong, Theis belles as in my deuyce, A slaundir of one goth vp so suyse, By fals report or iugement; Therfore folk[es] þat be wise, To sey the best shal neuer repent. 14 There is som tong can mater ffynd, Afore folk to fflatyr and glose, And cursidly can sey behynd, And of fals slaundir his sak vnclose, Resemblyng and braydyng on a rose, Outward fayre, and thorn in his entent, Wherfore late ech man hym dispose To sey wele, and he shal neuer repent. 15 Ther was on callid Diotropes, Of whom Seynt Iohn makith mencion; Whois tong couth neuer be in pees But brought folk at discencion, With fals spech and detraxcion, For ech mannys tong was rent, Wherfore ech of such condicion Were good to chaunge lest he repent. 16 Many a lady and princesse Of hiegh estate, and many a maide Tonges haue brought in heuynesse, Th[r]ough slaundir of tong falsly seid, And where the venym doth abreid Of recles tonges necligent, Therfore, remembr the on þat I seid, “Who seith þe best shal neuer repent.” 17 Salamon be writyng berith record, He had abhominacion Of tonges þat shew fals discord, Among folkes by diuysion; By hois cursid conclusion Ful many a trew man is blent, Therfore lern in this lesson, Who seith þe best shal neuer repent. 18 Sey the best of more and lesse Of low also and hiegh estate, Lete not langage to sone passe Nor bryng no folkes at debate. To their name sey not chekmate, Speke not withoute avisement But lern this word, erly and late, “Who seith the best shal not repent.” 19 Good seing doth ful greete plesaunce, To God truly and to ech man. Ther folowith þer-of no repentaunce Who to hym first þat slaundir ganne. The poison fro the Deuyll out-ranne Rote and branch fro hym oute went, Therfore þe best reed þat I canne, To sey wele and hit neuer repent. 20 Ther is no wers þat thei þat most deme, Ne more lewdir in theire lyuyng, For with a circumstaunce thei make to seme, Wele trewir in tast þan euer was trew thyng. And al is long in cursid fauoryng Of them þat lust hire of such oblocucion, Almyghty Ihesu, heuyn kyng, Staunch cruel tonges and fals detraxion. 21 Nature of God askith vengeaunce On falshed and vnkyndnes, For þer is neithir sword nor launce So whet to kerue with sharpnes, As tonges ful of doubylnes, For all the world with hem is shent, Therefore, for most sekyrnes, Who seith þe best shal neuer repent. Et ibi finis Inde. 67. SEE MYCHE, SAY LYTELL AND LERNE TO SOFFAR IN TYME. [MS. Br. Mus. Adds. 29729, leaf 130–130, back.] 1 See myche, say lytell, &amp; lerne to soffar in tyme; Emprynte thes thre in thy remembraunce. Lyke as the mone chaungith a-fore the pryme So faryth this worlde, replett with variaunce. Ofte lewde langage cawsyth gret distaunce, Wherefore wyse Caton seythe to olde and yonge, “The first cheffe vertwe is to kepe oure tonge.” 2 So wolde God, that thes fals tonges all Movynge and clappyng lyke þe leffe of aspe, Whos daly venym more bittar is then galle, Were bounden eche one &amp; closed with a claspe Tyll trwthe &amp; temparaunce lyst them to wnhaspe; For falce detractyon, lesyng, and slaundar Hathe slayne more people then dyde kynge Alisander! 3 Yff in this lyffe thow wilt encrese &amp; eche Thy worldely ioye, thyne ease, and thyn welfare, Be well avysed at all tymes of thy speche, And safe the sure frome Sathan and his snare. Ofte fals report of tonges kyndels care; Wherfore in spekynge at no tyme is he ydell That can his tonge att alle tymes wyselye brydell. 4 A lytell sparke ofte sette a tonne a-fyre But when it [brennythe], it is not lyghtely quent. O worde myse spoken may bringe the in the myre. So depe, in sothe, tyll thow ther in be drent. A falce tonge may floryshe well and peynt As for a while, but evar the end is shame; And wo is hym whos tonge hath lost his name. 5 Lytell medelynge causeth quiete &amp; rest; Ovar busy was nevar yet commendable. Loke where thow art in dout, &amp; deme þe best, Dele not with dobblenesse, ne be not dessayvable, Recheles and rakle ar offt tymes reprevable; Wherfore, thy self and thow wolt kepe fro cryme, Se myche, sa[y] lytell, and lerne to suffar in tyme.

Harl. 2251, leaves 246, back, to 249, back.] 1 Lyft up the ieen of your aduertence, Ye that beth blynde with worldly vanyte, No better myrrour than experience, For to declare his mutabilite. Lo! now with ioye, now with aduersite, To erthly pilgrymes that passen to and froo, Fortune shewith ay, by chaungyng hir see, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 2 Boys in his booke of Consolacioun, Writeth and rehersith fortunes variaunce, And makith there a playne discripcioun, To trust on hir ther is none assuraunce; For who til hir, lo! hath attendaunce, Is liche a pilgryme passyng to and froo, To shewe to vs with sugred false plesaunce, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 3 In this world here is none abidyng place, But that it is by processe remuable: For who had euer in erth suche a grace, To make fortune for to abide stable: Hir double face is so variable, Seeth by these pilgrymes that passen to and fro, To prudent folkes an ymage acceptable, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 4 Nis nat this world liche a pilgrymage, Wher high ne lowe no while may abyde? Liche a fayre peynture sette on a stage, That sodainly is oft so cast aside? Fy on pompe, and fy on worldly pride, Whiche bien but pilgrymes passyng to and froo, To shewe plainly, who that can provide, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 5 Oure fader Adam bygan with sore travaile, Whan he was flemed out of Paradice. Lord! what myght than gentillesse availe, The first[e] stokke of labour toke his price; Adam in the tilth whilom was holden wyse, And Eve in spynnyng prudent was also, For to declare as be myn advise, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 6 Is nat the cart and the laborious plough, Of lordes riches and of theyr haboundaunce Roote and grounde, if they kowde have i-nowgh, And hold hem content with fortunes chaunce. But covetise oppressith souffisaunce, In worldly pilgrymes passyng to and froo, To shewen allas and maken demonstraunce, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 7 And for to telle plainly and nat to spare, Whiche bien the worthy surmountyng noblesse, That han be tymes passid this thurghfare, And kowde therin fynde no surenesse, For to abyde but chaunge and doublenesse, What was ther fyne whan that they shuld goo? Redith the cronycles and trouth shal expresse, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 8 Who was more knyghtly than was Iosue, Whiche hyng vp kynges there at Gabaon? Or more manly than Iudas Machabe, Meker than Dauid, wiser than Salamon? Or fayrer founde than was Absolon? Icheon but pilgrymes passyng to and froo; Takyng ensample also by Sampson, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 9 Hector was slayne also of Achilles, As he hym mette vnwarly in bataile, And Iulius was murthred in the prese, Whan senatours at Rome hym dide assaile. What myght the conquest of Alisaundre availe? Al ner but pilgrymes passyng to and froo, Plainly to declare to riche and to the poraile, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 10 Remembrith how that many a riche realme, Hath bien to-forn cast downe and ouerthrowe, Prynces of provynces whilom Ierusalem, Was for his synne somtyme brought ful lowe, Seede of discord also that was sowe, Among the Troians in myddes of theyr mortal woo, Gyvith evidence to make men to knowe, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 11 Of Babyloyne the grete Balthasar, Whan he sat hyest in his estate royal, Ful sodainly, or he list be ware, Had from his crowne a ful dredeful fal; Mane techel phares writen on the walle, Taught hym plainly what wey he shuld goo, To vs concludyng in especial, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 12 [The gret stryffe and the deuisyon] Betwene Pompey and Cesar Iulius, Was grounde and cause why that Rome town Distroyed was, cronycles tellen vs; Cesar slayne by Brutus Cassius, Makyng thempire vnto declyne to goo, For to reporte plainly vnto vs, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 13 Hertis devided have caused mochel wrake; Recorde on Fraunce and Parys the fayre citee, Betwene Burgoynoun and hateful Armynake, Gynnyng and roote of grete mortalite, Shedyng of bloode, slaughter, and aduersite, As Martis chaunce torned to and froo, To yeve ensample if men kowde se, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 14 The fyft Henry, the myghti conquerour, To sette rest atwene Ingland and Fraunce, Dide his peyne and diligent labour, As he wele kydde by knyghtly gouernaunce, [But o allas, fortunes varyaunce] To grete hyndryng of these reames twoo, Toke hym awey, to shewe vs in substaunce, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 15 Clarence the Duk, ensample of gentilesse, Of fredam callid the verray exemplayre; The Duk of Excestre, ful famous of prowesse, Though he were knyghtly, he was eke debonayre; But for al that fortune was yit contrayre: To both these dukes, allas! why dide she so? But for hir list to shewe by mortal chaunce, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 16 Of Salusbury the manly Montagw, Though he was preved in armys a goode knyght, The fatal day yit myght he nat eschewe, Whan that he dyed for his kynges right, And Parchas sustren list preve ther yvel myght, Of his paradice, whan it come therto, To make a myrrour how we may have a sight, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 17 Stabilnesse is founde in nothyng, In worldly honour who so lokith wele; For deth ne sparith emperour ne kyng, Though they be armed in plates made of steele: He castith downe princes from Fortunes wheele, As hir spokes rounde about[e] goo, To exemplifye, who that markith wele, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 18 God sent aforn ful oft his officers, To dukes, erles, barouns of estate, Sommoneth also by his mynisters Surquidous people, pompous and elate, Ageyns whos somons they dare make no debate, Obey his preceptis and may nat go ther fro, To signifie to pope and to prelate, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 19 Of his bedils the names to expresse, And of his sergeauntis, as I can endite, To somowne he sendith langour and sikenesse, And som with povert hym list to visite; To iche estate so wele he can hym qwyte, Markyng his seruantis with tokens where they goo, To shewe hem plainly as I dare wele write, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 20 Whom that he lovith, the Lord forgeth hym nought, I meane the children of his heritage, He gyvith hem leuerey of gold ne perle i-wrought; The prente whiche he bare in his pilgremage, Scorne and rebuke cast in his visage, He pacient and sayde nothyng therto, But gaf ensample to euery maner of age, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 21 Thankith God with humble pacience, Whan he yow visiteth with suche aduersite, Heven nys nat wonne with worldly influence, With gold ne tresour ne grete prosperite, But with suffraunce and with humylite, For this lyf heere, take goode heede therto, Faileth ay at nede wherby ye may se, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 22 Kynges princis, most souerayne of renoun, For al theyr power, theyr myght, theyr excellence, Nor philosophers of euery regioun, Nor the prophetes preferred by science, Were nat fraunchised to make resistence, But liche pilgrymes whan it cam therto, To shewe ensample and playn evidence, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 23 Reken vp the realmes and the monarchyes, Of erthly princes, reigneng in theyr glorye, With theyre sceptres and theyr regalyes, With theyr tryumphes conquerid bi victorye, Theyr marcial actes entitled by memorye, And to remembre whan that al this is doo, They doo but shewe a shadew transitorye, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 24 O, ye maysters, that cast shal yowre looke Vpon this dyte made in wordis playne, Remembre sothly that I the refreyd tooke, Of hym that was in makyng souerayne, My mayster Chaucier, chief poete of Bretayne, Whiche in his tragedyes made ful yore agoo, Declared triewly and list nat for to feyne, How this world is a thurghfare ful of woo. 73. TIMOR MORTIS CONTURBAT ME. [MS. Harley 2255, leaves 128, back, to 131.] 1 So as I lay this othir nyght, In my bed tournyng vp so doun, Whan Phebus with his beemys bryght Entryd the signe of the Lyoun, I gan remembre with-inne my resoun Vpon wourldly mutabilite, And to recoorde wel this lessoun Timor mortis conturbat me. 2 I thoughte pleynly in my devise, And gan considre in myn entent, How Adam whyloom in Paradise Desceyved was of a fals serpent To breke Goddys comaundement, Wheer thorugh al his posteryte Lernyd by short avisement Tymor mortis conturbat me. 3 For etyng of an appyl smal He was exyled froom that place; Sathan maade hym to haue a fall To lese his fortune and his grace, And froom that gardeyn hym enchace Fulle ferre froom his felicite; And thanne this song gan hym manace, Timor mortis conturbat me. 4 And had nought been his greet offence, And this greet transgressioun, And also his inobedience Of malice and of presumpcioun; Gyf credence ageyn al resoun To the Develys iniquite, We had knowe no condicioun Of timor mortis conturbat me. 5 This lastyd forth al the age; Ther was noon othir remedye, The venym myght nevir aswage Whoos poysoun sprong out of envye, Off pryde, veynglorye, and surquedye: And lastyng til tyme of Noye, And he stood eek in iupartye Of timor mortis conturbat me. 6 Froom our forn ffadir this venym cam, Fyndyng nevir noon obstacle, Melchisedech, nor of Abraham, Ageyn this poysoun by noon pyacle, But of his seed ther sprang tryacle; Figure of Isaak, ye may rede and see, Restoore to lyff by hih myracle, Whan timor mortis conturbat me. 7 Moyses with his face bryght Which cleer as ony sunne shoon; Iosue that was so good a knyght That heng the kynges of Gabaoon; Nor the noble myghty Gedeoon Had no poweer nor no powste, For ther ffamous hih renoun, Ageyn timor mortis conturbat me. 8 Sampson that rent the lioun On pecis smale, thus stood the caas; Nor Dauid that slowh the champyoun,— I meene the myghty greet Golias— Nor Machabeus the strong Iudas, Ther fatal ende whoo so lyst see, Bothe of Symon and Ionathas, Was timor mortis conturbat me. 9 In the Apocalips of Seyn Iohn, The chapitlys whoo so can devyde, The Apoostyl thoughte that he sawh oon Vpon a paale hors did ryde, That poweer hadde on euery syde, His name was Deth thorugh cruelte, His strook whoo so that durste abyde Was timor mortis conturbat me. 10 Rekne alle the Wourthy Nyne And these olde conquerours; Deth them made echoon to fyne And with his dedly mortal shours, Abatyd hath ther fressh[e] flours; And cast hem doun froom hih degree, And eek these myghty emperours With timor mortis conturbat me. 11 These ladyes that were so fressh of face And of bewte moost souereyn, Ester, Iudith, and eek Candace, Alceste, Dido, and fayr Eleyne, And eek the goodly wywes tweyne Marcya and Penelope, Were embracyd in the cheyne Of timor mortis conturbat me. 12 What may all wourldly good avaylle? Strengthe, konnyng and rychesse, Nor victorye in bataylle, Fame, conquest, nor hardynesse, Kyngdammys to wynne, or oppresse, Youthe, helthe nor prosperyte? All this hath here no sykirnesse Ageyn timor mortis conturbat me. 13 Whan youthe hath doon his passage And lusty yeerys been agoon, Thanne folwith afftir crookyd age Slak skyn, and many a wery boon; The sunne is dirk that whyloom shoon Of lusty youthe and fresshe bewte, Whan othir socour is ther noon But timor mortis conturbat me. 14 In August whan the levys falle Wyntir folwith afftir soone, The grene of somyr doth appalle, The wourld is chaungeable as the moone; Than is there no moore to doone, But providence in ech degree Of recure, whan ther is no boone Saaff timor mortis conturbat me. 15 Ech man be war and wys beforn Or sodeyn deth come hym to saylle, For there was nevir so myghty born, Armyd in platys nor in maylle, That whan deth doth hym assaylle Hath of diffence no liberte To thynke afore what myght avaylle On timor mortis conturbat me. 16 Enpreente this mateer in your mynde, And remembre wel on this lessoun, Al wourldly good shal leve be hynde, Tresour and greet pocessioun. So sodeyn transmutacioun Ther may no bettir socour be Thanne ofte thynke on Cristes passioun Whan timor mortis conturbat me. 74. TYED WITH A LYNE. [From MS. Harl. 2251, leaves 38, back, to 39, back.] 1 The more I go, the further I am behynde; The further behynd, the nere the weyes end; The more I seche, the wers can I fynd; The lighter leve, the lother for to wend; The lengger I serve, the more out of mynd; Is this fortune, or is it infortune? Though I go loose, I tyed am with a lyne. 2 Drye in the see, and wete vpon the stronde; Brenne in watir, in fuyre fresyng; In reveris thurstlew, and moyst vpon the lond; Gladde in mournyng, in gladnes compleyneng; The fuller wombe, the gredyer in etyng; Is this fortune, or is it infortune? Though I go loose, I teyed am with a luyne. 3 A wery pees, and pees amyd the weere; The better felaw, the rathir at discorde; The neere at hande, the sonner set a-ferre; Accorde debatyng, debatyng at accorde; Furthest fro court, grettest with the lorde; Is this fortune, or is it infortune? Though I go loose, I tyed am with a lyne. 4 A wepyng laughter, a mery glad wepyng; A fresy thowe, a meltyng fryse; The slowar paas, the further in rennyng; The more I renne, the more wey I lese; The grettest losse whan I my chaunce do chese; Is this fortune, or is it infortune? Though I go loose, I teyed am with a lyne. 5 Weryles I walke ay in trouble and travaile, Euer travilyng without werynes; In labour idel, wynnyng that may nat availe; A troubled ioy, a ioyeful hevynes; A sobbyng songe, a chierful distres; Is it fortune, or is it infortune? Though I go loose, I tyed am with a lyne. 6 Wakyng a bedde, fastyng at the table; Riche with wysshis, pore of possessioun; Stable vnassured, assured eke vnstable; Hope dispeyred, a gwerdonles gwerdon; Trusty disceyte, feythful decepcioun; Is this fortune, or is it infortune? Though I go loose, I tiede am wythe a lyne. 7 A mournyng myrth, sobrenes savage, Prudent foly, stidefast wildenesse; Providence conveyed ay with rage; A dronken sadnesse, and a sad drunkenesse; A woode wisdom, and a wise woodenesse; Is this fortune, or is it infortune? Though I go loose, I tyed am with a lyne. 8 Vnhappy everous fortune infortunat; An hertles thought, a thoughtlees reme[m]braunce; Lo what avauntage! and sodainly chekmate, Now six, now synk, now deny for my chaunce; Thus al the world stant in variaunce: Late men dispute, whethir this be fortune? No man so loose, but he is tied with a luyne. 9 The world vnsure, contrary al stablenesse, Whos ioye is meynt ay with adversite; Now light, now hevy, now sorwe, now gladnes; Ebbe after floode of al prosperite. Set al asyde and lierne this of me, Trust vpon fortune? Defye false fortune, And al recleymes of hyr double luyne. 10 The gretter lord, the lasse his assuraunce; The sikerest lyffe is in glad pouerte; Both high and lough shal go on dethis daunce, Renne vnto Powlis, beholde the Machabe; Fraunchise of phisyk makith no man go free; Trust vpon God, defye fals fortune, And al recleymes of hyr double luyne. 11 Lothest departyng where is grettest richesse; Al worldly tresour goth to the world agayne; To kepe it longe may be no sikernesse, Of grete receytis grete rekenyng in certayne. Whan we gon hens al this shalbe but vayne; Trust vpon God, defye false fortune, That al recleymes of hir double luyne. 12 Nothyng more sure than al men shal deye, Late men aforne make theyr ordynaunce; vij. dedis of mercy shal best for vs purveye, And almesdede shal make achevisaunce, Texclude by grace the rigour of vengeaunce; For Cristis passioun mavgre false fortune, Shal-recleyme vs to his merciable luyne. 75. A SONG OF VERTU. [From MS. Harl. 2255, fol. 12 to 14.] 1 As of hony men gadren out swetnesse, Of wyn and spices is maad good ypocras, Fro silver wellys þat boyle vp with fresshnesse Cometh cristal watir rennyng a gret pas; So as Phebus perceth thoruh the glas, With briht beemys, shynyng in his speere, Byforn our dayes this prouerbe provid was,— Of prudent folk men may vertu leere. 2 Quyk lusty sprynges, that boile vp in the welle, Do gret refresshyng and counfort to the siht, Mong holsom herbys in vertu that excelle, What folwith aftir makith hertis glad and liht; Good hair a morwe aftir the dirke nyht, Passyng holsom al sesouns of the yeere, Concludyng thus of verray trouthe and riht,— W[h]o sueth vertu, vertu he shal leere. 3 Frut fet fro fer tarageth of the tre, Wyn takith his pris of the holsom vyne, Of puryd flour maad holsom breed parde, As clerkys wyse is holsom the doctryne; The wyntres nyht is glad whan sterrys shyne, Somer toward whan buddys first appeere, And the Maydewh round lik perlys fyne,— Who sueth vertu, vertu he shal leere. 4 Ech thyng of kynde drawith to his nature, Som to profite in wysdam and science, Som also to studyen in scripture, A fool is dullyd of slouth and necligence; Konnyng conqueryd with long experyence, Which noble tresour may nat be bouht to deere, And who that doth his enteer dilligence,— Vertu to sewe, vertu he shal leere. 5 A yong braunch wol soone wexe wrong, Dispoosyd of kynde for to been a crook, The ffyr of nature wyl growe vpriht and long, Hoot ffir and smoke makith many an angry cook; The fissh for beit goth to the angil-hook, The larke with song is Phebus massageer, A thryvyng scoler riht eerly to his book,— Who sewith vertu, vertu he shal leere. 6 Off rethoricyens men lerne fressh language, Of hooly seyntes procedith parfitnesse, Of furyou[s] folk debate and gret outrage, Of marcial pryncis vertuous hih noblesse, Of wise wisdam, of gentil gentillesse; For lyk hymsilf kynd wyl ay appeere, A cherl of nature wil brayde on rewdnesse,— Who seweth vertu, vertu he shal leere. 7 Lusty hertys in gladnesse them delite, Set al ther study on occupacioun, In ioye and myrthe, riht as an ypocrite Reioysith hymsylf in symylacioun; And bakbiters in fals detraccioun, To hurt wers than brymbyl, busk, or breere, Contrary to vertu of condicioun,— Who sueth vertu, vertu he shal leere. 8 Off knyhtis knyhthood expert in pees and werre; Marchauntys by travayle gadre greet richesse; Be nedle and stoon and by the lood-sterre, Maryners ay ther cours they dresse; And massageers with wacch and gret swiftnesse, Texpleyte ther iourne al tymes of the yeere, Ther grettest foo is slouthe and ydilnesse,— To alle tho that vertu list to leere. 9 Love Hooly Chirche, do therto reuerence, Do no man wrong, mayntene rihtwisnesse; Thouh thu be strong, do no violence, Specially no poore man oppresse; With glad herte parte thyn almesse; In prosperite be nat to proud of cheere, In aduersite be pacient with meeknesse; Sewe aftir vertu, and vertu thu shalt leere. 10 Touchyng also thyn occupacioun, Departe thy tyme prudently on thre, First in prayer and in orisoun, Trauayl among is profitable to the; Reede in bookys of antiquyte, Of oold stooryes be glad good thyng to heere, And it shal tourne to gret comodite,— Sewe aftir vertu, and vertu thu shalt leere. 11 Be no sloggard, fle from ydilnesse; Connyng conquer by vertuous dilligence; Slouthe of vices is cheef porteresse, And a step-moodir to wysdam and science; Labour cheef guyde to profit in prudence, With vertuous lyff take heed of this mateere, Withdrawe thyn hand from froward necligence; Sewe aftir vertu, and vertu thu shalt leere. 12 Sith thu were wrouht to be celestial, Lat resoun brydle thy sensualite, Geyn froward lustys flesshly and bestial, Ageyn al wordly disordinat vanyte; With fortunys fals mutabilite, Peysed how short tyme thu shalt abyden heere, Pray Crist Ihesu, of mercy and pite, Or thu parte hens, vertu so to leere. 13 With tyme and space and goostly remembraunce, Of oold surfetys to haue contricioun, Shrifft, and hosyl, and hooly repentaunce, With a cleer mynde of Crystes passioun, His v. woundys and blood that raileth doun, Vpon the Cros He bouht the so deere, Cleyme of His mercy to haue possessioun, With Hym to dwelle above the sterrys cleere.

Harley 2255, leaves 126, back, to 128.] 1 Toward Aurora in the monyth of Decembre, Walkyng alloone in contemplacioun, On flittyng fortune I gan me remembre, Callyng to mynde wourldly variacioun In poyntes dyvers be computacioun, Prevyng that she ay was vntretable; And euere my mynde concludid this resoun Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 2 Musis poetichall includyng royalte, In feyned tragedyes put therto delyght, Philisoffres moral, hih of auctorite, Thorugh experience of konnyng had delight. Among the Romayns previd was the knyght Whanne ad Rem puplicam he was profitable, With dynt of swerd lyst to diffende ryght, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 3 Off his crafft talkyth the artificeer, Frute folwith the tarage of the tree, Beyn twygges cause smokyng feer A beggere sett in a chayer of degree, Hym silff not knowyng in souereyn dignite, If this teerme to hym were appliable, Clene forgetith his consanguinite, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 4 In the goldene wourld ech man kept his degree, Chevalrye delityd nat with marchaundise, Nyse array in the comunaltee Lefft was, lyst them nat desguyse; Knyghtes in bataylle took greet empryse, Here laureat crownys to make perdurable. Al wourldly rychesse for wourship did despise Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 5 In the Capitolye among the senatours Honowryd he was, writyng whoo list se, Which lyst nat spare fel and sharpe shours, The right to diffende of the comunalte, Pryvat avayl lyst in no degree Vnto hym sylf make acceptable, In metal corrupt put noon felicite, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 6 The owle with the egle doth nat compare, Ne the lamb with the furious lyoun, The sleyghty ffox pleyeth with the hare, In feyned pees, to fals conclusioun, Ryght delyuered for ambicioun Vnto trewthe is nat appliable, Colowryd trety conuertible with tresoun Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 7 An argement sophistical doth me conclude, Hym which to resoun yevith aduertence, Dalida Sampson sotilly did delude, Materys sumtyme put be in suspence, Which partyes doth put to greet exspence, Wrechydnesse causyd that is detestable, Manhood withstondith in the prime temps Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 8 Mars goddesse souereyn of bataylle Brennyng Venus doth exyle froom hire ryght, Which shewyn hire sylff in countirfeet apparaylle, Froom his propirte drawith the hardy knyght In marcial prowesse that put shulde his delyght, Holdyng of the swerd to hym moost covenable, Enemyes foreyn to put vnto flight, Exsperience shewyth the wourld is varyable. 9 Off nedyl and stoon direccioun fayllyng, In his iourne the shipman doth erre, In Aurora a-fore Phebus doth spryng, Risyth with Esperus, namyd the day sterre, Thy tydy shepperde to save froom mortal werre, His owne sheep to hym moost amyable, On fooldys foreyn lyst nat looke to ferre, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 10 Whoom the egle lyst to diffende, Be poweer absolute moost imperial, To hym vengeaunce wyl not ostende, Othir foolys in poweer not egal, Othir conserve in a boody natural, Ech membre to othir supportable, Whoos contrarye destroyeth the body political, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 11 The eraunt theef is hange be the purs, Smal polaylle the kyte doth offende, Of the Chirche they purchace Crystes curs, Ageyn the sensours colours which pretende, A summe notable for hem to dispende, Rollyd at Rome in the audyte countable, Vndir colowryd pretens mateerys which diffende, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 12 Ageyn Aurora the cok doth meryly crowe, Which for envye redily doth fight, Countirfeet poetis seedys doun sowe, In mynde imagyned ageyn trouthe &amp; right. Al is not goold which shynyth cleer &amp; bryght, A beggere to a lord is not comperable, Lyk in apparaylle which apperyth to sight, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. 13 Vnprofitable talkyng with-oute discrecioun, As of Aristotyll doth teche the sentence, Is men to comowne ffailyng discrecioun, On teermys passyng there intelligence; A beggere to trete the hih magnificence Off a prynce famous and aggreable, Contrarye doth take for wisdam vnprudence, Exsperience shewith the wourld is varyable. Lenvoye Goo, litil bille, and vndir socour To euery estaat, this proverbe present, Ech tale is endid, as it hath favour, For among many ech man seith his entent. A greet multitude in oon to make assent Thyng celestial is, and devynable, Envye feerfull for devyne iugement, Experience shewith the wourld is varyable. Explicit quod Lydgate.</field>
