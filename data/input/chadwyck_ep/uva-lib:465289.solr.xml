      <field name="fulltext">Patronus redux: OR, OUR PROTECTOUR Is return'd safe again. ? Non si malé nunc, &amp; olim Sic erit, &amp;c. Hor. lib. 2. od. 10. Paraphrased thus by S. W. Though 'its bad now, 'twill soon be spent, Apollo's Bow's not always bent; But sometimes he'l the Muse bid sing, And touch a better string. To the Right Honourable, THE EARL OF CALANDER. THE PREFACE TO THE READER When on this Poem, Kind Sirs, ye reflect Both of a frowning, and benign aspect, Ye need not seek in its cross form, to Dig For the new Stamps of Torie, and of Whig. Nor from thir nice Distinctions, Rich, and North, Conclude, absurdly, such men to be worth. For I bewitch'd to Harmonie by Rhimes Dare not indulge the Discords of the Times. Nor, simplie, vaunt to either hand t'ave play'd, When in the mean time Vertue is betray'd. When Star-Divines, agreed in Notes, presage The Ills, which are, next year, to fill the Stage: When secret Fate may that to Life recal, On which time had bestow'd a Funeral. The Fable of the Lion and the Fox May now b' appli'd, since on the Gallick Pox Men are as apt to splite, as Ships on Rocks. He who desires to shun the Sirens Charms, And to hug Lab'ring Vertue in his arms; Let him Ulysses trace, that Man of Fame, Or Read this Hero, our well-chosen Theame, And if he grow not wise, he can't the Poet blame. 1 Were ever people happier then were we? Plentie and Peace bound long unto our Shore; From the hot Plague of Summer's Feaver free, When fresh Springs were convey'd unto our Door. 2 These, under Calander, we did enhanse, Of the first mover's Reign the blest Effect, Tho' the near Stars seem t'ave great radiance, And with strong influence on us to reflect. 3 Wee'd tasted scarce the Fruits of his abode, The Summer of his Presence scarce enjoy'd, When Critick Health him quickly call'd abroad, And his Departure our Delights destroy'd. 4 Ev'n so from those plac'd in the frigid zone, The Sun withdrawes his all-refreshing Light, And the fresh Pleasures of their Day anone, End in the sable weed of a long Night. 5 Did we not fully prize your influence? That you, so soon, t'eclipse your splendour chus'd, Thus to displace your Vertue, and drive hence The happiness, which we, it seems, abus'd. 6 So men, when sound and strong, ne'r reckon more Health's value, then did Æsop's Cock the Gemm; Till once thereof depriv'd, then they adore, What they before, possess'd of, did contemn. 7 What curs'd Diseases still this Clime infest? And drive men in pursuit of health abroad; These Serpents sure are brooding in the West, While undevour'd by great Men rose his Rod. 8 Sin was the thing which Mankind did defile, And, since, Rebellion hath the Earth o'rrun; Sure the Black Box was op'ned in this lsle, If where the sin increast these Ills begun. 9 In his aspect, enough t'ave made us proud, More then the Indian wealth we did engross, While under it the Vertues all did shroud, And nothing could our thriving Labours cross. 10 Lo 'it no sooner in black Clouds was wrapt, But, sensiblie, we felt our state decline, Each Vertue shrunk away, as Thunder-clapt, And ev'rie thing our ruine did designe. 11 Justice which all the rest doth represent, With an offended eye asquint did look; The one to us, his Creatures, was but lent, Th' other fixt on him, her three-footed Book. 12 Grave Temperance, when we her Bridle held, Was, from the mean, turn'd into loose excess, The Reins, like Phaeton, we could not wield, And, without Guide, the way but only guess. 13 Sweet Friendship which adversitie doth prove, As if grown peevish, straight forsook our road; She, without him, could not find mutual Love, Nor we trace her, but where he made abode. 14 Lo! Christian Charitie, as wounded, bled, Its Objects seem'd by meagre Cheeks to mourn, The poor by no religious Marie fed, And all the Land, Unchristian, seem'd to turn. 15 The instances of his indulgent Heart, And sumptuous Well grief, diverslie, did show; While these dissolv'd in tears, unforc'd by Art, And this, grown feav'rish, did forbear to flow. 16 True Loyaltie, the A. B. C. of our Youth, Departed not, but lay as't were asleep; Occasion call'd us not t'assert the truth, Loth, without Shepherd, to disturb the Sheep. 17 The Muses, since Mecænas he retir'd, To whom, tho' absent, they paid due respect; Were no more with the gen'rous grapes inspir'd, Nor got a Mistress in the Intellect. 18 Religion, which was wont to lead the Van, Came up, like tired Souldiers, in the Rear, All then, b' example drawn, to Service ran, Such is th' advantage of an Overseer. 19 Trade, which before here constantly did flow, And made the Town of forraign Wealth to boast, Robb'd of its Noble Patrone, fell as low; The Town its Traffick, Trade its Freedom lost. 20 Our foes occasion catcht us to distress, And ev'rie pettie foe appear'd too strong; To him, our Guardian, we could not address, Our selves unable to repair a wrong. 21 To ev'rie stroak our Body open lay, And what was aim'd against us did not miss: But, like his absence, none did so dismay, Each suff'red a peculiar blow by this. 22 Normand, our temper who exactlie knew, And could a Salve applie to ev'ry sore; Soon from our Helm the awful Pow'rs withdrew, When our affairs requir'd a double Oar. 23 The Pow'rs were angrie still, there yet remain'd A pious Hostie, to appease their ire; So massie Gold, for better use ordain'd, Must thus be tri'd, and purifi'd by Fire. 24 The blood of Beasts, it seems, the Gods deride, Man, harmless man, both Priest and Victime is; He, able only th' firie Test t'abide, Must expiate our guilt, procure our Bliss. 25 Or are the Defunct's Souls, by humane Blood, As th' Heathens fanci'd, now to be appeas'd? Nay rather he, who courted shades and woods, A living Tree in Paradise is plac'd. 26 Our tryal was not o'r, until the Clerk Had a surcease unto our Worthies sign'd; Fate knew that if the writing bore his mark, 'T would pass unquestion'd by the rest behind. 27 These were the Pillars of our Loyal Town, And chiefest remora of the Fates below; Whom Secret Fate no sooner had o'rthrown, But we receiv'd th' impendent Fatal Blow. 28 In this our Triple loss, he also shar'd, But, by his care and bounty, 'twas suppli'd, His chearing Presence then our grief empair'd, Now when the cause is giv'n, the cure's deni'd. 29 So when the Flames proud London's Beautie stain'd, And made her Lovers to dissolve in grief; The Royal Arm on it his Bountie rain'd, And from his succ'ring looks each fetcht relief. 30 To crouching thoughts at home we were enslav'd, And the assaults of future fear did kill; Lo! distant comfort there our hopes deceiv'd, When here were present Iliads of ill. 31 A mass of sorrow each day is ingrost, For fresh Tears yielding matter, time, and place: As if the curses of that bloody Ghost, Had fallen on us, and miss'd his own Son's race. 32 What Love, dear Patron, hath us dispossess'd, Your promised return, what fates retard? Tho' Love should cool, while we are sore distress'd; Yet Honour bids you your own words regard. 33 Make hast t'expel our foes, and bear the shock, O linger not, like th' Græcians, in the port; Return as Victour to his vanquisht Flock, Or, to your unfenc'd people, a strong Fort. 34 It seems the Gods did in this Kingdom fix Their plagues, and nothing could our sin attone; Thus Dryden's year of wonders, sixty six, Was but accomplished in eighty one. 35 O thou whose pleasure ord'reth ev'ry thing, And nothing done escapes thy piercing Eye; A speedie period to my suff'rings bring, And let me next the good impli'd espy. 36 Grant, while I hope my troubles to escape, And of ill Men and Dev'ls the subtile Plot; That I may the surviving profit reap, The sweet remembrance of my former lot. 37 Make me thus by affliction grow more wise, And like th' oppressed Palm, ascend more high, Out of thir mournful Ashes make me rise The more Renown'd, by a new progenie. 38 Renew my Patron's health, too long bereft, But the dear purchase safe at home transplant, Wherein, to's Welcome, during life infeft He may ne'r it, nor we the Owner want. 39 Grant us Remorse, and this thy Doom restrain, Thy Judgements, Lord, on us do not entail; And if our Pastor can no respite gain, Lord let the Bishop of our Souls prevail. 40 To thaw our Frosts make our warm Sun appear, And our eclips'd Horizon repossess; Grant the Land-Frigate homeward 'gain may steer, That we may yet retrieve our happiness. 41 Our pray'rs were heard, thus th' easie Gods soon are, By pious Airs of the afflicted, pleas'd; As soon as Jonah made his mournful Pray'r He from the scalie Prison was releas'd. 42 As Tullie to the City 'gain to hie His covetous desire could not withstand; Ev'n so our Patriot casts a longing eye, Far back reflected on his native Land. 43 Yet here always, tho' distant far from this, B' ubiquitie of care, he present was; So Ovid his dumb Legat did dismiss To Rome, when there the Master could not pass. 44 As soon's he had survey'd it in his mind, He was transported hither by desire; His winged fancy could sweet footing find, VVhere he from cares of Court wont to retire. 45 No wonder he preferr'd this Plot of ground To th' English Dales, which tempted but his Eyes; Here all these Pleasures, without price, abound, Planting at home his Earthlie Paradise. 46 He payes, afar, a Visit to the Town, On which he ample Ben'fits did bestow; Obscure and low, bereft of Patrone, grown, VVhose rise again to him alone must ow. 47 Nor Law, nor Order did amongst them thrive, As if they had been under Pupillage; But whose free course his presence will revive, And bring on them again the Golden age. 48 As when Aurora drawes away the Skreen From th' Earth, and with Vermilion paints the Skie, The Sun in our Horizon straight is seen, Impatient till her Beauties he espy. 49 So our Lord's way was with chast Beauty strow'd, His Ladie's Graces, of magnetick force; VVhich, when first view'd by our expecting Croud, Gave notice, he would soon begin his Course. 50 Lo! how her Glorious Presence chear'd the Fields, And made the Journey seem exceeding sweet; The Pleasures which she brought, the way but yields, And ev'rie thing kind welcome seem'd to Greet. 51 The Birds, the feather'd Muses of each place, To welcome her by sweetest Stanza's strove, And weari'd not her moving Court to trace, As if with some bright object faln in love. 52 VVind only fail'd, to set him off from shore, His restless thoughts already home confin'd, VVhich, as his Harbingers dispatch'd before, Foretold himself would not stay long behind. 53 It took effect, the weather straight grew fair, A gentle Gale sprung from its Earthly womb, The Sun both guilt the Skie and warm'd the Air, And all did club for to dispatch him home. 54 The Sea-leagues seem'd to be abridg'd in walks, And all the Seasons to be chang'd to May; VVhile his enrich'd and time-beguiling talk, Then the swift pinnace, did discuss more way. 55 First, at the flitting Port, the Land he prest, VVhere he his Votive Table satisfi'd; Thus to do good his purposes were blest, And did forestal a thankful VVind and Tide. 56 A Friend near by, such such in absence found, To's welcome did the compliment first pay; And while the sundry christen'd Healths went round, He, but with one, would terminate the Day. 57 The parted twain, in their Embraces sweet, Here match again, and distance reconcile; So Rivers seem with closer Huggs to meet, After Divorce made by some justling Isle. 58 And their Re-union quite expells the fear, Their parting bred, and better hopes succeed; So ill, a-part when Leda's Twins appear, Good luck, when join'd, to Sailers is decreed. 59 From thence, like Lovers, longing to improve The mutual Pleasures, home they quickly drive, VVhere they unlock not former knots of Love, But th' holy flame, and nuptial sweets revive. 60 At home? but yet he scarcely home hath win; VVhen him, unrested, bus'ness calls away; Thus he must use his dwelling as an Inn, Only to bait in, but not long to stay: 61 For at the Maiden-City he arriv'd, Often refreshed by his Golden Show'rs; Nor yet, by absence, of these Drops depriv'd, Such Influence she hath on her Paramours. 62 The Lawyers, for their Clients interest, Their Chymick Counsel lavishly disburse, The Merchants wooe him too to take their Test, And both agree to milk and share his Purse. 63 A Welcome Home each pay, a gainful Debt, Knowing on whom to work, and how to move, His gen'rous Soul will not let him forget, Each to requite with Pledges of his Love. 64 Thus, nobly their allegiance he repay'd; Him none for kindness, nor for Debt can crave: And while we long for's coming hither stay'd, Of the unwilling Citie he took Leave. 65 The distance, 'twixt his Palace and the Town, Was swallow'd in the compend of a thought; He, by warm puffs of speedie triumph blown, Hither, without Geometrie, was brought. 66 The ten-years-wandring Greek, upon the main, Arriv'd, was not more welcome to his Spouse, Then was our hon'red Master come again, Untoh is people, and his lonelie House. 67 His Palace seem'd, the Doors and Windows ope, With laughing front, its Landlord to receive; Thus to the Builder's praises they gave scope, And seem'd his stay, and oversight to crave. 68 The people proud of their restored Lord, Soon by diffusive joy were overcome; And at his Entry powr'd out of their hoard, A show'r of blessings to his Welcome home. 69 The Mothers frame the Children understand, And shevv such joy as vvith their age can suite, And vvhile the elder run to Kiss his Hand, With silent Eyes the younger him salute. 70 Lo as he pass'd each Heart nevv vigour took, And straight forgot that they erstvvhile did mourn: Ev'n so the Flovvr's, fred from their Prison, look, When the nevv Sun to Aries doth return. 71 All vvhile the Flagg of Duty is display'd, Their Persons, Povv'r, and Wishes under't bring, And while the Tribute of their Lips is paid, Th' adjacent Hills with his loud Praises ring. 72 So to a new Play, by the Laureat spun, Acted on a new Theater, or Stage; Many, led by an am'rous humour run. And with their Plaudits, the whole Club engage. 73 To his return, Falkirk will take delight To found an Holy day, and feast in State; So the brave Thebans from their signal fight Their yearlie Ceremonies us'd to date. 74 The Graces now on the ascendent are, The Virgin, and old Saturne come again; Warrs Gates are shut, and they such Fortune share, As Rome did under its first Founders Reign. 75 Again they gladly to his Reign submit, The Powr's obeying from the Sacred got; Whom, if, by right, he had not wedded it, They would call hither to preside, by Vote. 76 And now their Well with a full Pipe abounds, And doth its Way by Tides of Joy extend; The measur'd falls of whose glad Streames will sound The Donour's Welcome home, world without end. 77 The Fabrick of this Monument of Fame, At stately height arrives, by fair degrees; And each, by higher Notes, as't were Proclaim The Founder's praise, and hold spectatours eyes. 78 The Shire with circling mirth receives its Reeve Sheriff, on just and hon'rarie account: Whose Chief and Loyal Town its grief reprieves, Turning the Dol'rous, to a Joyful Mount. 79 Their former state, his Presence doth reduce, And raise their Pleasures from the fatal Urn; His looks doe Soul in ev'rie thing infuse, And Vertue scorn'd dares, with its Lord, return. 80 Religion, which of Faith and Life's compos'd, Grew fresh again, and a new courage took, Within the Kirk the Parish is inclos'd, And his Devotion is the Laicks Book. 81 His Zeal unto the Church is well diffus'd, Flowing through all its Pastors, Levi's race; By him his own is honourablie us'd, Striving to found his Patronage on Grace. 82 The lustre of whose Grace the Chappel Paints, And th' exercise of others Grace excites. So th' English Church is Beautifi'd by Saints, And to the Heavens rapps its Proselites. 83 His Conscience, laid unto the sacred Line, Is found exact, and worthie to get trust; His Honesty his Honour doth Define, And the exactness of the rul'd adjust. 84 As Theseus did the Labyrinth deride, By th' help and train of Ariadne's Threed; So he, the Sacred Rule being still his guide, From the dark Mazes of the times is freed. 85 Justice, observing him, on us did throvv At once both Eyes, dispensing looks by Rules; Thus she, vvho lookt before Regardant, novv Is, vvith our Lyon, Sejant, full-fac'd gules. 86 As his true Honesty, meant by the Shield, Is firmly propt by the proud Lyon's Pavv: So may our Town be safe, vvhile 'tis upheld By this great Atlas of the Civil Law. 87 When doubtful Cases in the Law occur, The practicks of his Life we need but scan; Scarce one foul Act that Volume seems to blur, But each page gives the due to God and Man. 88 Nor Rich nor Poor, through preference, are heard, Nor the first speaker, can bribe his applause; Like Alexander, th' other Ear unbarr'd, Is always free reserv'd unto the Cause. 89 As a good Poet doth not 'gainst measures sing, But hath to Laws of Art a due respect; Ev'n so his Acts in equal ballance hing, And of strict Justice make him Architect. 90 Who would obedience to his Laws refuse? When the extreams are so well interlac'd, Which would be, if Rogation were in use, By all the people's suffrages embrac'd. 91 His Debtors to indulge he's eas'lie brib'd, Yet most precisely purgeth his own Debt, His life in Melibæus is describ'd, To calm the Countrie, and Land-marks to set. 92 The man, by him to sit in Judgement call'd, Must Justice weigh with an impartial hand, So those, by the Ægyptian Kings install'd, Were ti'd to Law, tho' th' King should countermand. 93 The worthie still commence his substitute, And such, tho' strangers, here give only price; Whereas that Citie's Gates 'gainst Vertue shut, Are necessarly open unto Vice. 94 Friendship, which, with the Head, our bounds had fled, Now by a closer Union is begun, Thus She doth his uniting Presence wed, And wooe him as the Marigold the Sun. 95 His Friendship knows no treach'rie, nor by path, Nor can the knot be easilie untwin'd, The pious relicts of the Attick Faith, Are on the Table of his Heart enshrin'd. 96 His Friendship, the three requisits unloades, Which he, deep-fraughted, doth to's Friends import, To whom he daigns to shew's familiar Gods, And give sufficient share of ev'rie sort. 97 He chuseth Friends by worth, and not by weight, The honest, tho' but poor, enhance his Voice, And those who fit his humor, are upright; Such sympathie is 'twixt his Friends and choice. 98 Altho' his Genius sociable is, Yet likes not Leagues with many to contract; For scatt'red Love becomes too soon remiss. And many Friends too many cares exact. 99 The fewer Branches that the stock foments, The Bodie's sap is not so soon decay'd; And a great River deeper water vents, Where Streams through fewer Channels are convey'd. 100 To all the Right-hand 'tis unsafe to reach, Or any, rashly, our near Friend to make: So the first matter, as the Physicks teach, Is any form made capable to take. 101 Their Room all blanch, yet without Charter hold, Nor by the new, the old are justled out; And these, in the first Table once enroll'd, Stand fast, tho' Fortune's wheel should turn about. 102 His Friendship with their Fortune won't expire, The lab'ring Ship abhorring to forsake: And when their wounds due medicine require, Duty and Pitie place together take. 103 These timely and discreetly he reproves, Not fearing, for reproof, his Friends to loose; So sometimes to the Patient, whom he loves, Th' expert Physician gives a tarter Dose. 104 His favours, secretly, he makes them taste, Which are more welcome, when they thus surprize; So that Philosopher's conveying cast, Seem'd more enam'ring in the Painter's Eyes. 105 He won't cement with these who palliat Truth, And mutual admonition do repell; He, whose mind is bely'd by's fawning mouth, Is unto him as odious as is Hell. 106 These, who to what he speaks, strain their assent, And to his humour can their own adapt, The subtile Fowler fitly represent, When by his mimick voice the Bird's entrapt. 107 By honi'd words he'll not be prey'd upon, When under such the lurking venome stayes; And tho' smooth-tongu'd applause hath Honour won Yet better 'tis to claim deserved Praise. 108 Now Temperance began their Hearts to wean From tickling pleasures which they had pursu'd; As soon's he rul'd the day, the Golden mean Was in the motions of their minds renew'd. 109 His Temperance hath influence upon us, Perswasive by its modest Dialect: When he superfluous cost abandons thus, We, needless excess, must, for shame, correct. 110 Frugality, his humour thus doth fit, Being thereto from his budding youth inur'd; So by the youth in warrs taught well t'acquit His age, Want will be patiently endur'd. 111 Good Education is a kind of spell, Whereby the Child, in's spring, is lull'd asleep, Untill his pliant mind be season'd well, Which will the scent, through all its seasons, keep. 112 Yet, when his Honour at the stake is laid, He can in lib'ral offrings ev'n transgress; Deserving works, by him are doubly paid, His Bounty rather tending to excess. 113 And while he strives to imitate the Gods, The man ingrate of his Benev'lence shares; So, with ill men the Sun lives not at odds, But to their roofes indiff'rently repaires. 114 He might, by Fortune, be to riot mov'd, Yet huggs Sobriety the Friend of Health, So Life may be prolong'd, Estate improv'd, Mingling together Poverty and Wealth. 115 Litle sufficeth Nature best, if such We knew aright to use, and not to waste, He thinks it meet, whose pow'r can compass much, To be contented quietly with least. 116 Our Loyalty, the Subject's nat'ral Test, His happy advent from its slumber rous'd, By his obedient mouth we are confest, Altho' before, through want of tongue excus'd. 117 This seems t'ave been an an Heritage entail'd Upon the Fam'lie, still to be improv'd; Nay thro this breath, long from the stock exhal'd, The arms will still be honour'd, and belov'd, Digression. 118 A Race so stamp'd with Loyalty and Wit, That it should ever tend to the ascent, Not only in the Senate, rais'd, to sit, But to enhanse the Reins of Government. 119 What Tongue, the Index of th' abounding Heart, Hath greater Love to their great Lord exprest? I pray, whose hand was abler to assert His Prince and Countrey's mutual interest? 120 With what a courage did he brave his fate, Who fell by too too powerful foes oreborn. And with his dying breath pronounc'd it great, Court grandeur and all earthly pomp to scorn. 121 What Courtier, 'midst vicissitudes of State, Hath longer stood unhing'd, or tumbled down? As if true merit aim'd to consecrate Brave George, the surest Atlas of the Crown. 122 He who succeeds to lead the Fam'lie's van, Is like to inherit too their lasting Fame; If they the Nation of that Tribe began, He'll prove the chief promoter of the same. 123 And lo a graff sprung from that verdant stemm, Early begins fair Blossoms to send forth, Making the lustre of that sparkling Gemm To be best seen, through his own living worth. 124 None can him, for Disloy'ltie to his Prince, Without injuring innocence, impeach, The Legends of his Faith and Life evince The practice, of what Law and Gospel teach. 125 For he, in th' old stock of Allegiance 'graft, The right of the Supreme can ne'r explode, By Faith, on whatso'er pretext, he's taught Not to resist the Ordinance of God. 126 In state affairs his hands were not embrew'd, And yet his Loy'ltie is no whit the less; This in his private station hath been shew'd Not yet being call'd to publick business. 127 And he, whose temper jumps not with the time, A more retired course of Life should drive; Thus he, who with the publick could not chime, Did not in men's eyes, like Augustus, live 128 If we the Court and Countrie would compare, Reck'ning with that, the changes, cares, and strife: One, but half-witted, sure would this preferr, And damn the greatness of a Courtlie life. 129 The Countrie life effectually promotes True piety, and innocence abetts; Unto sublimer thoughts it us devotes, And frees us from the Art of counterfeits. 130 Here he enjoyes what wish can e're pursue, Hugging contentment under's shadie grove; The pow'rs, as'twere, allow him here to view, And to foretaste the sweet that are above. 131 Here is the shade of a well peopled wood, Where Nature's choristers have pleasant shrowd, A Garden where the glitt'ring flow'rs do bud, And a Spring talking, musically, loud. 132 Lo here are flowrie Walks, and laughing meads, These feed the body, and the eyes thir Feast; With pond'rous Fruit, here each Tree hangs its head, Able to tempt the eye, and please the taste. 133 His Palace, bord'ring with the common Rode, Seems, hospitably, for its guests to call; And, by his pains, repaired alamode, Outbraves the Shadow of the Roman wall. 134 The ancient Towre, which was by th' English storm'd, And by them suff'red an unbribed death; Behov'd, by levelling, to be reform'd, And to be purg'd from the Usurper's breath. 135 He means his Dwelling publicklie to shew, Removing lets, which might obstruct the eye; So Drusus House was built in open view, That all the City might his life survey. 136 Yet, Hermit-lik, he courts not Solitude, Tho never less alone, but when he's so; A civil life he leads for for others good, Which is the best and noblest of the two. 137 Lo Charity of its wounds freely cur'd, Retrives the Revenues it had before, Others are by his Charity allur'd, While he the widow cheares, and feeds the poor. 138 Within his breast the naked Graces meet, And, christianly, their Offices exerce; There is their Temple reer'd, as in the street, Ne'r meaning to cut off the poor, their terce. 139 If Charity its traffick can enrich, Then he might soon a wealthy Merchant grow, For he refuseth not an Alms, and which, Often unask'd, he largely doth bestow. 140 The needy, dayly entring at his Gates, Return suppli'd with a most willing loan; And lest the wingless bee meet with hard fate, He oft, with hony, feeds the yawning drone. 141 His wealth thus is for ends, by God design'd, And not for worldly byass ends employ'd; And tho' the payment here should be declin'd, Yet 'twill, with int'rest, after be enjoy'd. 142 The Muses, in their Patron's presence safe, Recover their collation, cashier'd long; Glad to have made their first Love's Epitaph, And kindly tun'd the Reals nuptial song. 143 He still refresheth with the early dew, Of his free favour, the ingenious Bards: Maro's reproach to him will ne'r accrue, While he the Gods, and Sacred Verse regards. 144 To pay them honour he's no whit asham'd; Nor thinks't disparagement to nourish Art: Mecænas by Posterity is fam'd, Who did much favour to the Tribe impart. 145 The Nine, from Jove, their pedigree derive, But their well-being much to this Hero owes; 'Tis just his praises should his fate survive, If such advantage from the Muses flows. 146 To count his Vertues o'r, and trace their tracks, They'l take delight, enam'red with his Name; Nay they, if Glory can but match his Acts, Will write them in the Calendar of fame. 147 VVhy should a drop of his Renown be spilt, VVhile by the Muses, 'tmay be intercept, Or, on such Chappel as the Roman built, 'T may be engraven, and from falling kept. 148 Through his departure, Trade, shipwrack'd almost, Discov'reth nigh a long expected Port; Now Riches will be driven on our Coast, And Commerce will chuse hither to resort. 149 The Town's dear purchas'd freedom he'l defend, VVhich some had ta'en occasion to invade; Thus from the Duke, the Merchants noble friend, Our Peers may be mov'd to encourage Trade. 150 The old unjust reproach is now defac'd, VVhile all the fruit of their Industrie taste, His frugal steps, now by his people trac'd, Make 't seem a paradox to loose, or waste. 151 But might the Scandal bear a new Record, That, of Renown, 't might a new income bring, If so we prove more duteous to our Lord And, with our Lord, more Loyal to our King. 152 O're them his Power, gently exercis'd, With their consent, hath him obedience won; To him the People's hearts are sacrific'd, While he is pleas'd to make their case his own. 153 The Sun when near to make the brightest hour, And reach the highest point, appears most slow; So, he exalted both in Place, and Pow'r, Becomes more moderate, and nobly low. 154 To purchase Rev'rence, he doth not affect By coy and swelling lookes, and seem too high, When he, who meets with such squint ey'd neglect, Into his life, too curiously, will pry. 155 Nor yet remark'd, on suppliants to have frown'd, His Clemency being by such Voice alarm'd, So Cæsar's ears were by the zealous sound Of Pray'rs and Supplications strangly charm'd. 156 Strange! how a kind Superiour's look or word Charmes the warm heart, and makes th' affection spring; So he, who easie access did affoord, Was only worthy thought, to be a King. 157 Here Vertue's Tree appears to grow and spread, And stand, unshaken, fix'd by a deep root; And tho' the Tree is hid, as was Nile's head, Yet 'tis known to his People by the Fruit. 158 As that cold herb, when growing near the Vine, Transmits its healing Vertue to the Grape; Ev'n so his active Vertues theirs refine, And by his Courtly Manners theirs they shape. 159 By him that subtile Precept's not transcrib'd For the appearance, not the thing to care; He, only by Moralities, is brib'd, Not by Politicks, which vain Titles bear. 160 Could Sacred Vertue humane shape invest, Sure it would his assume, as most Divine; Lest th' Inns should be mistaken by her Guest, Here are hung up all Plutarch's speaking signs. 161 Thus he the toils of Vertue first o'rcome, May Honour's Trophees, not unjustly claim; So all through Vertue's Temple, at old Rome, Were wont to pass, e're they to Honour's came. 162 As Cæsar did his waiting Friends engage, To seal his last breath with a joyful cry, So he, his part once acted on the Stage, Will sure deserve a solemn Plaudite. 163 His former benefits, among them sown, (Tho' yet the later he upon them heaps) Twice blasted, now by's second heat are grown Mature, and he a thankful Harvest reaps. 164 The better part he chuseth, to Bestow, To take with thankful hearts, they make't their work, Ne'r to be chang'd into the male Cuckow, But hatch'd, as't were, under the grateful Stork. 165 They pray he may, at home, sound Health enjoy, Where th' air less then the English soil offends; Where he can better his Soul's Health employ, And sway the Bodie's, if't on that depends. 166 May these hot Baths thus prove medicinal, To purge away all pain, and pamper Health; So Æson's youth the Sorc'ress did recal, And made him Grat'late in the stoln wealth. 167 May his sweet mate, thus wat'red, pregnant grow, And, landed safe, her masculine fraught unlade; So while Nile doth the Pharian Lands o'rflow, Fruites are produc'd, and living creatures made. 168 After the fall of calm and balmie show'rs, Which to be welcom'd, by the Fields are seen; The smiling spring sends forth her plants and flow'rs, And paints the teeming earth with white and green. 169 O may this Treasure not long here be couch'd, But drain'd, as streams, from this delicious source, The Palm and Olive, by Latona touch'd, Did the strait passage, long obstructed, force. 170 The fruitful Womb is now to Scotland sent, To make the number up in CHARLES his waine; Could Nature then be so improvident, As t'introduce a Prince, without a Train. 171 This doubtful Guest, Health, at dear rate repair'd, To treat aright, the men of skill advise, Not to be toss'd by cares, nor passions snar'd, But th' mean to keep in food, and exercise. 172 And to recruited Health may Fortune add Encrease of Lordship, equal to her own; On whose retail may no co-heir be glad; But, without Rival, that you Reign alone. 173 As 'tis more safe one bear supream Command, Then it' mongst many diff'ring heads should fall; So, under Charles, wee'd have our spot of Land (Unlike the Eccho) know but one man's Call. 174 This this shall be the scope of all our Vows That Both, in honour, long together live; While to Subjection's yoke each calmly bowes, And under them, be Chronicled to Thrive. 175 Till Heav'n, first of their Vertues th' Earth possest, And fill'd with fame, late to receive them daigne, Where Marie, with the worthies, shall be blest, And Alexander, more then Monarch, raign. The EPILOGUE. His luckie aspect, when from us estrang'd, With lofty buskins did the stage befriend; Th' unluckie Scene its Restitution chang'd, And made the Play with Comick shooe to end. FINIS.

Amor animi halat. Hearty affection breath's out. Car. Anagr. 1. Quod tibi dilecti sint proximus &amp; Deus, insto, Vestri quandò Animi suaviter halat amor. Love, as the two Decalogue-objects due, God, and our neighbour, will to both accrue; For't scents so sweetly, thus exhal'd from you. O Ara miti in mala. O sanctuary to the meek against troubles. Car. Anagr. 2. Improbus hic nullo, durusve potitur asylo, In mala quum solum mitibus ara pates. The lewd, and rude need not expect to share In your Protection, when, 'gainst galling care, A rampier to the meek you only are. At arma animi alo. But I maintain the armour of the mind. Car. Anagr. 3. Exultent artes talem reperisse Patronam, Quæ ferat, arma animi convenienter alo. Let Arts exult, that they have found, in need, Such noble Patroness, by name decreed The working mind, in season, thus to feed. FINIS. On the preceeding POEM, Patronus Redux. Here Maro's loafty, and immortal straines, Here Seneca's Diviner raptures flow; Here Ovid's fancy in this Mirrour shines, Plutarch's Moral'ty here it self doth show. Here Learning burnisht with Pegasian fire, And Love with Wit these mighty Lines Inspire: Which Lines, to give my judgement of the whole, Will Burnet and Buchanan both control. To the Learned and ingenious Gentleman, M. L. the Authour. Sir (tho' unto my grief) I must confess, I know you not so much as by the Face, Yet by your other Writtings which I saw, And by the Portraicture which here you draw, Both of your Self and Patron, not to smother My thoughts, you both are happy, each in other. So let the Patron's love and Poet's be Bounded with nothing but eternitie. N. P. TO Michael Livingstone OF Pantasken, Upon his Panegyrick on the Earl of Calander. Tho' Poets now, in this malicious age, In factions joyn, and in damn'd Clubs engage; Plotting to bite in mercenarie Rhimes, And with vile Satyres to lampoon the times: Yet here such paths our Author seeks to shun, And can't, with pleasure, in these footsteps run, Scorning to build the Trophies of his Fame, Upon the ruines of some nobler Name: Neither will he the sensual Creature please, Our huffing Gallants, or such Fops as these, By Writing bawdie; or, with placquet Rhimes, Nick all the itching Wenches of the Times. These easier Ways, he, with contempt, doth view, And not the Many, but the Vertuous, few, He strives to please, and set that goddess forth Vertue, adorn'd with all her native worth Such as she was, e're common made by Fame, Who christned Vice with her usurped Name. Will. Scot.</field>
