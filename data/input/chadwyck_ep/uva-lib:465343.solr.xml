      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HONOURABLE JAMES HALYBURTON of Pitcur, Esq; Member of Parliament of Orkney and Shetland, and Colonel of the Third Regiment of Foot-Guards, &amp;c. The verse has been extracted from prose text. The late Lord Gray, and mony mae Lang syne did tent my rustic pipe; My pipe was green, but new cut frae An ill-grown reed, and was nae ripe. The Earl of Morton neist enquir'd, What I could carol, sing, or play? His Lordship what I sung admir'd, And rais'd what I could never lay. And syne, without a' lett or had, I strutting came to public view; My cap'ring fancy maist gane mad, That's anes again reviv'd by You. Sure, pride's the gyte of ignorance; For fools are easily puff'd up; But when sic leads me out to dance, E'en let my fancy take its scope. Fair fa' your heart, who cur'd my spleen, When I was dwining, like to die: I dowie sat, and aft did mane, But now I'll-sing right merrilie. And when I sing, I'll ay hae mind O' You, and ever wish Your heal; And when I drink, be't ale or wine, You for my tost sall never fail. Thou puny soul, think'st thou that we Regard ought that's perform'd by thee? Thou and thy Rural Muse may go To vulgar sots, that nothing know, But to converse with sheep and cattle, And unto them your nonsense prattle. All are oblig'd to honour, love, and prize Great public spirits, by a thousand ties: The city, country, and each family Are bless'd while under such authority: Like planet stars, they spread their influence On all around their place of residence. All public spirits public blessings are; And it is only their peculiar care Their nation's welfare always to advance, And help all that are low in circumstance; Ev'n as 'tis said, Atlas the earth upbears, So they support all those within their spheres. Collace, Aug. 24. 1753. ALEX. NICOL. PREFACE. Hope. Proceed, go on, and let the world once view Dame Nature's gifts she hath bestow'd on you; Why should that talent she so frankly gave, Be lost by thee? In this you play the knave. Fear. Beware, take heed, consider what you do; What cares the world for ought perform'd by you? Poor are your parts, your fortune mean and low, And money always makes the mare to go. Your vain ambition puffs you up to stretch, And striving, fain would rax above your reach; Fools haste makes waste, so will it fare with you; 'Tis often seen, a poor man's friends are few. Hope. Sure Heav'n and Nature something have design'd, In raising you above the vulgar kind; Without th'advantage of an education, Such ne'er was seen since Scotland was a nation: Shake off dull fears, apply the great and good, Sure Fate will favour you, you may conclude. Fear. Who climbs to rash, may catch a fall at last; He must run slow at length who runs too fast. Ye little know what straits an author's in; Your loss comes first, and yet no hopes to win. Expence and travel you must undergo, Ere ye accomplish't; and yourself may know How insufficient, poor and indigent You are for that on which your mind is bent. Hope. Tush, senseless fears, take courage and once try, There's no assurance till you first essay; Cowards die of fear, while yet they have no cause, He wins no honour who from fortune flies; He that's faint-hearted wins no lady fair, Heav'n gives no grace, unless 'tis sought by pray'r. Apply the gen'rous, then; when they refuse, Drop all your hopes, but never blame your muse: Indulgent Heav'n who gave the gift to thee, Rules over fate, gives fortune her decree: Both are connected, and will surely move Men to befriend, and of thy muse approve, And Critics banter turn to sympathy; Take courage therefore, and be frank and try. Experience she can speak for me, and tell You was encourag'd; let true hope prevail, And banish fear; that slavish fear which racks Your purest fancy, and your mind distracts: Be of good cheer, enjoy what Heav'n thee gave, Your Muse will shine among the Great and Brave. To the Author, on his Collection of Miscellany Poems. I have, my Friend, your poems all perus'd, And, with attention on the same have mus'd. Do you incline my sentiments that I Should thereanent express impartially? If so, to please you, them I'll here rehearse Ingenuously, tho' in rude dogrel verse. Beauties and faults do both in them appear; Many the first, the last but few and rare: But, taken in the complex, I avow, They're excellent, and must give you your due; Your pregnant fancy tow'reth far above That sphere in which mean rhyming scriblers move; Your stile's polite, refin'd and elegant, Surpassing far their silly vulgar cant. And (which the highest praises doth deserve,) You your decorum handsomely observe. I see Melpomene with grief distress'd, All bath'd in tears, with sighs and groans oppress'd; While in sad lays you mournfully deplore Th'unhappy fate of good and great Strathmore. Or when Monorgan's much lamented death, She seems to swoon, and pant for lack of breath, In sorrow plung'd, in sable vesture clad, Doth droop and languish, mourning for the dead. But then, Thalia, in your past'ral song, Looks brisk and gay amidst the Sylvan throng. Bright chearful joy shines in her countenance, While you in softest numbers do advance Agatha's charms, smiles, beauties of that fair, And nuptial blessings of the happy pair. When Erato takes a sublimer theme, To raise on pillars of immortal fame, A noble Hero of great Douglas' name, Then, in heroic and majestic strains, She soars aloft, and leaves the rural plains. Thus with your matter doth your Muse comply, The greatest art, methinks, in poetry. O had that nat'ral genius of thine, Brisk wit, rich Fancy, which in you combine, Been polished by lib'ral education, You might have prov'd an honour to our nation. Great Tully's verdict is, without demur, Confirm'd in you, POETÃ NASCIMUR. Ja. Ballenden. NATURE without ART. PART I. Containing Comical POEMS on Several Subjects. An Account of the Author, being an Epistle to the Right Honourable Susanna Countess of Strathmore, in the Year 1727; but newly revised and corrected, with some Circumstances then omitted. Madam, To let you know my birth and station, My vulgar life and education, Take this swatch in a short narration. A poor mechanic was my father; (My mother had no riches either); He was an artist of his trade, And honest deem'd ay where he staid. But shortly after I was born, He dy'd, left me almost forlorn. I was at school 'bout half a year; That letter'd me first in the lear. About the age of six or seven, Cast wholly on the care of Heav'n, I shifted time, toss'd by hard fortune, Till I was near the age of fourteen; Still poor, and destitute of friends, With struggle scrambled through my teens. I made a sham of turning packman, Though my stock was not worth a plack, Ma'am; Thus through the country I went vaguing, Liv'd by a gentle way of begging: The reason is, I was not able To work for any fixed table; For, when a child, I had a nurse, That ev'ry day deserves my curse; She, in her frolics, let me fall, And brack my back, and bruis'd me all: Unknown to father or to mother, The vile trull did me almost smother. None knew the pain that I did find, Until it made me stark stane-blind. So that I, for a whole year's space, Saw neither light nor human face; And to this day I am short-fighted, But that's a wrong cannot be righted. I rather mark it for a wonder, That this distress I dy'd not under; But Heav'n, by which all things are guided, A longer life for me provided. Then, when I was near aged twenty, I dealt in sangs and ballads plenty; Until my fancy pregnant grew, But how to vent it I not knew: Oh then, thought I, if I could write, I'd have my wishes all complete. Then I got paper, pen and ink, But how to write I could not think; I gain'd good people where I past, To teach me letters first to cast. So I improv'd it to this pitch, By which I reckon myself rich; Ay since, ev'n to this very time, I had delight in writing rhyme. As for opinions, I confess, I never upon them laid stress; Sometimes a Whig, sometimes a Tory, But seldom steadfast in one story. The reason is, I'm not yet fix'd, So my religion is but mix'd; Yet, most of all, I do incline The old Episcopalian line; Yet not so fixed on this head, But I can turn my coat for bread. Yet don't mistake my meaning, as If from the truth I meant to pass; Th'essential parts of my opinion, Is not in any sect's dominion; Nor will I e'er be tied to think, That in one spring I ought to drink. In Christendom we all affect The Christian name, in some respect; Yet, to our shame, and our derision, We're full of schisms and division. Some are Papists, some are Prelates; Some are Quakers, and some Zealots; Some Anabaptists, some Aquarians; Some Antinomians, and some Arians; Some are Free-willers, and some Ranters; Some Presbyterian covenanters; Some Erskinites, to gain probation; Some Glasites, some for Presentation. Though these all aim at heav'n at last, Their diff'rence puts me in a gast; To follow which I cannot tell, Therefore I bid them all farewell; Because I know, that faith and love The sphere is wherein I should move; For sure, without true charity None can enjoy felicity. But charity, now at this day, She is oblig'd to fly away; Instead of which, envy and hate, Contempt, resentment and debate, Is most in each society. This makes me all these sects deny. 'Tis not in word, as I do read, But Christians must be so indeed; So, Madam, this is all my creed. As for my stature, 'tis but little, My body weak and very brittle; Not eloquent; of simple carriage; Plung'd in the careful state of marriage; Rich in children, poor in wealth, Bless'd with a competence of health; A wanton mind, an heart that's cheery; But seldom dull, and often merry; Contented with my rural dishes, Writing and thinking's all my wishes; Though my encouragement's not meikle. I'm Madam, yours, while ? Sandie Nicol. An Introduction to a Wedding SONG. To the Right Honourable the Lord ?. Wake Powers of Love, disclose your blooming charms, May Cupid clasp me in his glowing arms. Thy shining conquests merit lofty lays, And fire the meanest thought to sing thy praise, Hence sullen cares, expire in Lethe's strand, And fix your dungeon cells in Pluto's land. Haste, Sylvan choirs, your tribute Graces move, And lead your glories to the fields of love; While from the eastern folds the morning ray, With heav'nly pomp, breaks up great Morton's day. Morton, that noble celebrated name, The seventh in peerage, as the first in fame. See! see! the fair with easy trips obey, And add new lustre to the gleams of day. Serenest joy, fair Virtue's paragon, And soft majestic notes employ the throng. Some well-lung'd herald then did thrice proclaim, And stretch'd his open throat on ev'ry name, Or lord, or knight, professing arts or arms, Who stray'd on title to Agatha's charms, Streight to spring up, and there declare his right; Justice soon knew her own, and scan'd their might. All, but my lord, sunk down, and hid their face, Commenc'd that instant mute, and slaves to Peace. Her olive wand display'd, almighty Jove Applauds his daughter for her sense of love. The list'ning sun o'er-heard the welcome voice, And with superior blaze attests his joys. Burgundy starts, and pours the grateful juice, An off'ring to the god for's pleasing news. Even Cyprus, groaning with her liquid store, Flows unconstrain'd, and will be shut no more. Old Hymen, shatter'd with his length of toil, Relents to youth, and courts a laughing while. The Dreams, sepulcher'd Dons, in Morpheus' reign, Are bless'd to breathe, and see the solemn train; They think it favour, when allow'd to see A bride, whose guardians Jove and PhÅbus be. The feather'd audience of the middle sky, Are public heralds of their deity, They heave in music, as they soar on high. Heav'n's senate smiles upon their early care, To see the great united with the fair. Fame is a goddess, and surveys her own, And loves all minions faithful to her throne. This Empress calls, I must her charge obey, Tho' courting honour, I do lose my way, And like stun'd Phaeton, exalted stray; While breathing instruments hung on your praise, And vocal benches echo back the lays. The ODE. Taught to command, frail human laws May plead their proud dictator's cause, And muster sanction as a name To lash obedience into fame. But love, that still subsisting phrase, Commanded in the golden days, Even brought a Jove's red thund'ring arms To stoop beneath its conquering charms. Pluto, that dull infernal king, Exulted rapt'rous in his reign; The black and immemorial stream, Could ne'er ingulf Proserpine's name. Sol, the bright regent of the day, Sunk at Leucothoe's brighter ray; Pent up in clouds, revolv'd to night, And bade his love dispense the light. Wedlock, kind Cyprus' early claim, Will softly lengthen out its flame, While flashing lights wheel round their way, And nymphs shine brighter here than they. Hail, welcome tie! stretch on thy chain, Still add a conquest with thy pain; When eye-ball lightning wounds the heart, With nuptial balm bind up the smart. Douglas, who swells the lifts of fame, And echo founders on his name, Hath felt the power of Venus' son, And 'tach'd his honours to his own. From Agatha's imperial eyes Delicious death so frequent flies, The prostrate beau invokes the care Of Cupid to insure the fair. The sigh'd request soon reach'd the throne, The melting eyes became his own; The fond well-natur'd gods up stood, To join the noble with the good. The Graces gamboll'd in array, Which far outblaz'd the glare of day; Yet, inly groan so soon's they see The fourth outshine the former three. Illustrious fair! your consort prove In's acts as happy as his love; Enjoy the triumph of your eyes, Nobility's the fairest prize. Hail, happy Pair, distinguish'd shine, The parents of a race divine; Dissolve in smiles, and Virtue's store Be yours, till Heaven can give no more. A POEM, inscribed to the Right Honourable the Earl of Morton, on his accepting the former Ode, &amp;c. Tho' great Apollo, with the tuneful nine, Should make old Homer strut in ev'ry line, In juster accents I could ne'er express The votive debt of my low thankfulness. My fond ambition had no higher slight, Than be a prostrate in your Lordship's sight: But your acceptance of my homely lays, Begot new fancy, and provok'd to praise. Thus Horace his bold and immortal pen, Did lasting friendship from MÃ¦cenas gain. His elevated thought and copious style Did founder critics, and refound their toil. Propitious Fortune! if a pow'r thou art, Thou still retain'st thy old indulgent heart; Else shining coin had ne'er compens'd my tone, Or made Lord Aberdour my great Patron. Since gratitude that pious quest may claim, Such lengths of duty, and so great a name, Her Ladyship shall still inspire my frame. If e'er my grov'ling reesty rills of sense Shall fail to glide in easy eloquence, The lov'd ideas in my breast shall grow, And in a constant tenor ever flow. But oh! forbid that high illustrious name Be less in fancy than it is in fame. Pardon, my Lord, my mean abortive praise, While it unguarded o'er your glory strays. Silence, with all her mighty sinking fund, Cannot depress or level with the ground Your glories, num'rous as light atoms, fly In no low sphere, but path the liquid sky. Thy bold ancestors stood the dire alarms, When foes and death did both descend in arms: Uncommon brav'ry was their lov'd renown, They courted their country's glory as their own. Douglas and Bruce will be continued names, Fresh in the lists of all poetic themes; Guardians of freedom, to the cause still true, They brought about what princes could not do. No Caledonian nymph, how much refin'd, Can share the virtues of thy consort's mind; The easy current of her seraph sense, Her lively flow of winning eloquence; Besides the wonders of her charming face, Her softning smiles, and pure majestic grace; The keener lightnings quickning in her eyes, Justly detain your love, and tell your prize. Like thee, those ancient peers, both Maul and Hay, Whose title stands on banks of oozy Tay, Did fondly wed the Halyburton line, And were the parents of a race divine. Hail, happy pair, whose conjunct life but one, Makes one life double, and the single none. The DREAM. Aenight as I lay sleeping unka sound, And all my cares in Lethe's river drown'd, Lo, e'er I wist, old Morpheus, with his train, Came sliding in, and buzz'd about my brain. Ten thousand tricks with juggling art they play'd, Made me believe what ne'er was thought or said. At last, methought, they carried me away, Unto a field more beautiful than May, And left me there alone, where, for a while, I pleas'd myself to see dame Nature smile: All things appear'd so beautiful and fair, That I forgat now, or who brought me there. At last I wearied, being all alone, Because the place to me was still unknown. While I was musing how I had come there, Methought I heard sweet music in the air. At last a maid, the fairest e'er was seen, Appear'd before me clad in richest green, Methought it was that Goddess call'd Love's Queen. She had no 'tendants at the time, that I Could see or hear; but, as she passed by, I spy'd a harp, like silver, shining clear, And on it writ, THALIA CHASTE AND FAIR. I call'd to mind, how this name did belong To her that was the Muse of past'ral song. Then suddenly this thought came in my mind, This field is surely sacred to the nine; And that Parnassus certainly was nigh, Where Poets say the Muses use to stay. I swiftly ran, fond! fond! to view the fair; Fain, but afraid my mind for to declare; Yet impudence good manners threw aside, And to the lady rashly thus I said: Be pleas'd, O Madam, to my suit to yield; Tell me to whom belongs this beauteous field? She smiling said, Dear lad, whence camest thou, Or whether bound, and I'll conduct thee through This spacious plain, to where you have a mind? Take courage, say to what you are inclin'd? (For trembling seiz'd me when the lady spake, Yet manners said, some answer I should make). Madam, said I, 'Tis kindness unlook'd for; My inclination leads me to much more Than I expect I ever can attain, Therefore t'attempt it, I'd better refrain. No, said the lady, say what you desire, Or what great height to which you would aspire. Now humbly, Madam, at your great command, I'll my ambition let you understand: I long to see Parnassus' sacred mountain; I long to taste the Heliconian fountain; Those places where the Muses do frequent, To correspond with them I'd be content: But oh! I know that is reserv'd for those Of riper wits, who more of learning knows, And not for me, poor dull illit'rate creature; The Muses friends are more sublime by nature; Their nature too's refin'd by education, Ere they attain the Muses conversation. Then said the lady, Pity it were, poor lad, That you not learning and acquirements had: Since you affect our company so much, I'll fire thy genius with one single touch, That ne'er shall cease, but cause you still aspire In poetry, beyond the vulgar sphere. Dear lady, pray but mind my low estate; I want respect, since I'm illiterate; I cannot write to please the great, and those That poetry and other science knows: I cannot touch the vulgar in my rhyme, Their ignorance holds every verse a crime. Thalia said, You quite mistake the case; The great, the learn'd, will give your writings place, Though you're unlearn'd, men will admire you more, For your performance in a state so poor, Than you the learning of the best had gain'd; For though a verse with nonsense should be stain'd, They will excuse it, pleased with the rest, While critics banter faults that's in the best. Improve your genius, read old authors over, Perhaps you may the spring and mount discover. Walk but aside with me a little way, And taste the streams that from the fountain stray. Just as I tasted, Morpheus he appear'd In direful shapes; I was so much affear'd, That, at first sight, I started up awake, And had no time of her my leave to take. This I thought real, yet nought but visionary; It prov'd a dream, an empty allegory. Yet often since, both fancy, rhyme and numbers, Prevented have my leisure-hours and slumbers. Ambitiously I grasp still at the moon, Ends like a dream, when all my labour's done; Yet still I'm hopeful, as Thalia said, Some gen'rous men will my poor genius aid, That I may have some thing whereof to boast, 'Cause I want wherewith to defray the cost. On the Death of the Honourable Henry Crawfoord of Monorgan, who died March 1731. With sad reflection bygone times I view; The world seems wild with changes that are now. O strange! to see the most delightful place So much refin'd, now turned to disgrace; Where once of late, my dear MÃ¦cenas reign'd, My Muse's softer, and my choicest friend, Heartsome and kind; how often have I seen Him pleas'd, and smile at Christ's Kirk on the Green. The whole of Ramsay's blyth diverting numbers He much admir'd; they oft beguil'd his slumbers. O kindly smiling, still he took delight Me to instruct, and set my verses right. He gave me books from his own liberary, And borrow'd for me a Scots dictionary. E'en to be short, what sense of verse I have, I owe to him; but O! I now perceive A drowsiness o'er all my soul to flow; My fetter'd Muse faggs sore with grief and woe. O grief! to see the pleasant fruits and flowers; The shades and arbours, and the lightsome bow'rs; Sweet gowany greens, and trees aft flourishing; Melodious birds on boughs ay carolling; Their artless music taught them by dame Nature, The second parent of each living creature; Gentle Zeph'rus whistling thro' the trees, The ancient offspring of mount Hybla's bees; From flower to flower, still gathering to increase Their winter stock against a stormy stress. All these are stain'd with the imperfect kind, Which late delighted spirits more refin'd. Once more, my Muse, reflect on these fine days Wherein Monorgan merited thy praise. Not only thine, alas! what canst thou do, Poor giddy thing, dull, and illit'rate too? Had I engine, as ancient Homer had, His fame should then more amply be display'd. Frail fading flesh uncertain is to trust, For cruel death reduceth it to dust. Stone monuments, or fame-recording verse Can best old friendship afterwards rehearse. How dull looks all the Sylvan train to see The walks untrode, trode formerly by thee? Where once, of late, the mavis us'd to sing, The doleful owl makes all the groves to ring; Where once, of late, the nurse's lull-a-ba, And charming maids under Eliza's awe, Made all the place delightful to the eyes, Now all's dispers'd, all waste, all des'late lies. Gone then, dear friend! and shall your memory Die with your body? O! forbid that I Should more survive, when once your fame is dead; But why should I think it can ever fade? Your fame shall live in your sweet progenie, Your Consort's comfort in her grief for thee, Who shall yet banish from the pleasant place The baser sort, and all their ill bred race. I hope to see his hopeful Son to stand In's father's stead, and all his own command. I hope to see the Mother, in old age, Rejoice to see each of her sons a sage. I hope to see the Daughters plant the plains With pleasant prospects of heroic swains. I hope to see the tenants put in mind How once the father was to them so kind: When as the Son improves what he began, And proves the wisest and the bravest man. Hail, gentle youth, may all the stars conspire To raise in thee a noble gen'rous fire; Far to outstrip thy honest ancient Sire. The young Man's Litany. I'm now arriv'd at perfect age, and can Discern myself a reasonable man. Since 'tis decreed man should not live alone, An equal match my mind is set upon. But seeing daily the bad consequence Of rash amours, because of ignorance, Most part of men in marriage go astray, Why? Bastard Cupid blindly leads their way. Ambitious pride still prompts men to be great; They aim at nought but grandeur, wealth and state. Some base born strumpet, or ill natur'd wretch, With ill-got pelf, must be the lordly match; And when possess'd of this vain glorious wife, It lands, at last, in hurry, pain and strife. Some servants grudging, when fatigu'd with toil, Do rashly marry, and their peace beguile: Such like reflections makes me to beware, And claim kind Heaven's aid by earnest prayer, That I may be directed in my choice, And taste the sweets of matrimonial joys. Indulgent Heaven, the guardian of man's race, Grant my request, as pledges of thy grace; Then shall I sing with grateful voice to thee, And oft with joy repeat thy care for me. O then, from all leud strumpets, who are led, By vile desires, to stain the marriage bed; From dull, indocile, clumsy, sleepy queans; From one that's careless, and no virtue minds; From one that's proud, or basely insolent; From frantic fools, or wilful ignorant; From gaudy dressers, and malignant wretches; O, Heavens! deliver me from all such matches. From one too old, or one that is too young; From one that is of vitious parents sprung; From one that's thriftless, nasty, unperfeit; From one in whom I can have no delight; From one that wants an ear, or well-tun'd voice; O Heavens! I thee beseech to hear my cries. From wanton widows, flush'd with youth and ease; From one that won't be curb'd from what her please; From one too rich, or one that is too poor; From discontented, one whose looks are sow'r; From mamm's one daughter, brought up in her house; O Heavens! deliver me from such a spouse. From gamesters, tiplers, idle ugly sluts; From self-conceited, crasy, crack-brain'd wits; From peevish mutterers, charmers, omen-tenters; From liars and thieves, and lonely residenters; Deform'd, immodest, vitious, all in fine; Sweet Heaven! forbid I match with such a kind. From busy meddlers in matters not their own; From one whose passions soon to blaze are blown; From one puff'd up with vain and prideful thought; A secret feeder, careless, good for nought; From one regardless of Heav'n's laws and me; From one contentious, Heaven keep me free. And send me one, both honest, neat and clean; A perfect beauty, with a graceful mein; A virtuous, fortunate and comely creature; A blithe and cheery maid, with handsome feature; A learned wit, with eloquence and mirth; A prudent lass of no contemned birth; One mild and temperate, easy reconcil'd; One who can keep my secrets unreveal'd; One pious, modest, chaste, discreet and wise; One that's upright, without a vain disguise; One who, at times, upon a small estate, Can, with her neighbours, seem to be more great: Let it be said, that she excels them all That Sol'mon mentions, or the good St Paul. May that old motto truly be applied To happy she that Heaven ordains my bride, Full many daughters have done virtuously, Yet there is none but what's excell'd by thee. The young Woman's Litany in Choice of an Husband. O heavenly powers, celestial and divine, All things sublunar are entirely thine; Young men and maids are under thy inspection, And in my choice I come for thy direction. May some kind genius from on high descend, And guide the arrows which blind Cupid send. If e'er my hap be that he shoot for me, Grant I may find thy care to that degree, So that I may have everlasting cause To honour thee, and reverence thy laws. From gray and bald heads, and decrepit joints; From all whose noses to the ale-house points; From gustless gabs that cannot taste of love; From those that daily in their fancies rove; Prom pimps and rakes, and all such misery; From fornicators, Heavens deliver me. From beaus of pleasure, those adapt'd to pride; From idle knaves, that no way can provide For house nor wife, but spend away their time; From epicures, that pamper much their wime; From railers, liars, those stain'd with perjury; And from all thieves, Heavens deliver me. From cursers, swearers, all profanely proud; From clam'rous fools, that speak their folly loud; From irreligious discontented sots; From all oppressors who retain the spots Of avarice; or cow'rdly seem to be; From all dissemblers, Heavens deliver me. From thriftless spenders, careless of their home; From sluggards save, lest in their hands I come; From nasty blockheads, all dull clumsy sots; From superstitious useless idiots; From self-conceited peevish silly creatures; Oh, Heav'ns! deliver me from all bad natures. And send me one, both sturdy, tight and tall, With an estate to suit the man withal. One with a love-taste to admire a woman; One who is stout, and yields his right to no man; One who can daut me, and at night ly near me; I thee beseech, kind Heaven, soon to hear me. One who is bless'd with lib'ral education, Sprung from an honest ancient generation; One whose religion is sound orthodox; One lightsome, and who innocently jokes; One true and faithful, minding his affairs; O Heav'ns! I thee beseech to hear my prayers. One of repute, good manners and good sense; One with an air of purest eloquence; One humbly kind, and with his state content; One profitable to church and government: O Cupid, hasten such comforts to my life, For, troth, I long to be a married wife. One in whose nature all perfections meet To make an husband and a man complete; And can with patience sometimes hear my bawling; One diligent, who loves to use his calling; In fine, let him exceed what I can say: O Heavens! hear me, I thee humbly pray. While I'm a maid, I'm useless to the nation, And do not build a future generation. If all my sex would virgins always stay, The world would run to ruin and decay; But we have much more gen'rous thoughts about us, Than to think men can well subsist without us. To the Right Honourable, the Lord Gray, upon his sending me Mr Ramsay's Poems. Fair fa' your Lordship's canny hand, That ga' Monorgan, on demand, Bright Allan's first collections, Whilk serv'd me as a wing to fly Unto Apollo's clemency, For his divine directions. I'll thank your Lordship heartily, In my ain Scottish cant, For that bra' help it made to me; I wish you never want A plenty of dainty Provisions ev'ry day; I'll bless you, and wish you What here I winna' say. Of your bra' dwelling 'gainst the sun, Near where the gentle Tay doth run, May your posterity Be heirs, till time shall be no more; And as they die, convey'd to glore, To reign eternally. As for Yoursel, Wife, and ilk Child, And a' your kith and kin, May ne'er your virtue be defil'd; But still more honour win. Incline then, to shine then Aboon the rambling crew, That haste ay, to waste ay Their 'states. My Lord, adieu. To two GENTLEWOMEN. Upon whose cheeks sits blooming youth, Like roses yet unblown, Some happy swain will pree each mouth, Tho' to them yet unknown. But yet, perhaps, I guess a' wrang; The match is thought already: I care not tho' I see, ere lang, Each of the two a lady. An ACROSTIC. Immortal, sure! some fair of Cyprus grove, Emergent from the softest seats of love; Awful to sight, thy beauties kindle more, Noose all the soul, and shoot through ev'ry pore. Charms kind, as morning pearls and melting eyes, Rob Florio's heart, and kill by just surprise. A gentle stream, of pure superior sense, With depths of judgment, form thy eloquence. Fame, thro' her waste of reign, displays thy worth; O pleasing view! and calls thy merit forth. On wit and learning, all fresh incense lay, Refined virtue vies the tide of day; Divine Arete, these are all thy prey. Another ACROSTIC. Engine I want, thy name to beautify; Less, less I know its great antiquity. In annals represented it doth ly, Zealous for fame, renown and loyalty. And you adorn with fresh and brighter fame, Bless'd Nymph, the glory of thy ancient name; Embellish'd features, glister over all Thy beauteous form, all is majestical; Has all that's winning, or we valued call. Heaven smil'd on Nature, in her secret cell, Annex'd what could exalt, or yet excel; Lo, all the Sylvan fair implore your love, Lost in those pleasing charms your beauties move. Young Damon scarce dare let his eye-balls roll, But when thy charms blow up his inmost soul. Under yon beach he all in vows doth sit, Reviews thy graces, and adores thy wit. The sighing swain o'ercharg'd, at length doth cry, O Gods, relieve my smart, or else I die; New victims then shall on your altars ly. LOVE's CURE. Dool fell the swain that's mang'd wi' love! He goves for comfort frae above; But Cupid, and hard-hearted Jove, Blink na' relief: And a' his gaunts and gapes but prove Milk to his grief. If some auld swinger snap to speak Of pink-ey'd queans, he gives a squeek; My heart fu' sair, needs that blyth eek, To mend my dool: If Cyprus dame had up her cleek, I'll be her tool. The meikle trake come o'er their snouts That laugh at winsome kissing pouts, Wha look like sheep at merry bouts, And steal a smile: Lang syne they had their carlish doubts, And sighing while. When Jeany geakes, and scorns my tale, And winna yield for prins or ale, That day my tripes will had na kail; Oh! storm-sick then: But if she gaufes, I think her leal, And wow I'm fain. The snapsy karles grane in ease; They sleep and eat whene'er they please; And hae their lucky to keep their clease Baith tight and clean: But we, like waff fok, speal the braes, Love daft and keen. Ilk merry look and wally taste, Gi'es health unto the gamesome jest; And still wi' something they are blest, I winna say, For fear some humour bang my breast, That winna lay. Heal be their gab that Jeanie praise, And tell her o' my bonny plays: Perhaps she'll briss to sic fine days Wi' Venus' leave: Then I'll be vex'd wi' na mae nays, Nor restless live. O Sanny syne will heartsome be, And for lang groans gouf up, Ti hi; E'en not a Jove so fond as he Wi's Juno's charms; When I shall fidge so devoutlie Busk'd in her arms. My heart will midge-like dance and reel, And nouther fear a cow nor deel, But wallop, as Meg i' the Skeel, In jolly nature; And look as brisk as fil'd-up steel, Upo' the matter. But if a' mercy, things misgae, I'll ramble like a Lybean rae, That flees the wood, scorns hay and strae; My planets wyte, The last redress, Lucadea's brae, Oh! hard respite. A Collection of Scots Songs, being new Words adapted to old Tunes. SONG I. [What's all this vain world? or what boots it me] To the Memory of the Right Honourable Charles, late Earl of Strathmore, To the tune of, The yellow-hair'd Laddie. What's all this vain world? or what boots it me, Though I swim in plenty until that I die? Since Heav'n hath robb'd me of my heart's content; While life remains in me, I'll mourn and lament. My sweet lovely Strephon, the pride of the plain, Defending Amyntor, was suddenly slain. My comforts and pleasures, they all disappear, Since no more my Strephon is; Strephon, my dear! When with sad reflection our pleasures I view, Which formerly, Strephon, past 'twixt me and you, My passion, with anguish, makes me cry and roar, Since, my lovely Strephon! I see you no more. Alas! for my Strephon what need I complain? My sighs and my tears, they are all in vain: But still to my fancy ideas appear Of the wonted pleasures 'twixt me and my dear. His smiles and his carriage made all men him prize, The flower of the shepherds, and eke the most wise: His youthful appearance was ay sweet to me; And both our affections were loving and free. 'Mong shepherds my Strephon always led the van; He was noble hearted and loyal to Pan: He judged their causes with great equity; For which now they miss him, and do mourn with me. On that fatal day, when he went from home, I little suspect'd him so soon in his tomb! How dismal and heavy the news was to me, None knows it, none feels it with such misery! But since my dear Strephon no more can return, I'll pay him a tribute of tears every morn; Still wishing that Juno fair Iris would send, With her fatal knife my sorrows to end. SONG II. [Bless'd with my dear Eliza's charms] To the tune of, The bonniest Lass in a' the Warld. Bless'd with my dear Eliza's charms, I have a store of treasure; When I'm busk'd in her slender arms, I can bear no more pleasure. O! since my lucky stars have had An influence so kind then, As to make me t'enjoy a maid According to my mind then; I'll strive to pleasure my sweet lass With kisses and caresses: Let all the dull unthinking class Be banish'd all such blisses. My arms encircling her small waist, Her lips and mine together, How to unty that lovely twist, It is a grudge to either. O she seems loath to bid me quit, And I as loath to do it: We yield to other such delight, No tongue nor pen can shew it. Now farewell, all the times I rov'd, And smil'd on diff'rent beauties; Since one I happily have lov'd, I'll stand to all love's duties. SONG III. TIMBER STAIRS. O Peggy dinna say me na; But grant to me the treasure Of love's return; 'tis unka bra', When ilka thing yields pleasure. Nae pleasure is like love's return; Dear Peggy grant it to me: Nae mair wi' coy slighting spurn, When I my love do show thee. The forest birds example show, My handsome bonny lassy, That lovers should not single go; Therefore be nae mair saucy; But yield unto my fond desire, My dearest charming jewel, And quench the flame of Cupid's fire, That burns me up like fuel. Thy face so beautiful and gay, Engageth me to love thee; Thou'rt sweeter than the flow'rs in May; There's none I'll prize above thee: Thy wit shin'd so into my eyes, Above all human creatures, That Cupid caught me, as a prize, Beholding thy fine features. The ways of virtue, Peggy, trust, I will observe fu' bralie; I'll shun the steps of Venus' lust, When others wi' them dallie. Up stairs, down stairs, down stairs, Timber stairs fear me; I pray you, drap your foolish fears, Dear Peggy, and come near me. SONG IV. The poor Prentice. âI am a poor prentice, bound frae all pleasure; âFain wad I see my love, if I had leisure.â Sleeping and waking her image presents me; O she is my pleasure, and yet she torments me. Blind Cupid did challenge me in battle to th'field; I thought nothing of it, and yet I must yield. And now, as a captive, his bondage I'm under; Of all my resistance he did me quite plunder. But, if my dear jewel wad cast away scorn, And not leave me comfortless, like one forlorn, The bondage I'm under wad be a full pleasure, For that my dear Jenny has charms out of measure. O Phoebe, assist me, by shining most clearly, When I go to the lass I love so dearly. By day, as a captive, my master I'm serving; And sometimes, wanting food, I'm almost starving. Yet all is a pleasure; I count it a fine life To gain that fine creature to be my ain wife. Her beauty and wit, her lips sweet as honey; When dreaming, I cry out, My love she is bonny! I'll rifle her charms yet, when I'm at freedom; And be to her constant, or fates strike me dumb. The happiest of creatures I will be surely, In her arms when I ly snug and securely. SONG V. Few good Fellows when Jamie's awa'. Hard fate to be absent from him that I love! A lot that is surely determin'd above. Yet Heaven's indulgent; and therefore I may Be blest with my Jamie, although he delay. The seas may be calmer, the winds blow more fair; The clouds may dispel, and the elements clear; My Jamie return, and come safe to the shore, With firm resolution to leave me no more. Hard fortune has call'd my dear Jamie away; In far-away parts he's obliged to stay: His own affairs here to ruin will come, If Providence send not my dear Jamie home. His foes they maliciously seek for my wrong; They jest me, and jeer me, and make me their song; They guilefully flatter my servants; and they As eithly believe them, since Jamie's away. He left me a gun, and an old rusty sword, As pledges he faithfully would keep his word: They bribed my servants, and took them awa'; And now, at his coming, I want them to shaw; For which he may brag me, and ca' me unjust, And tell me, I am not well worthy of trust: And what if the spirit they call Jealousy, Should make him to doubt too of my chastity? And if misreports, as many there be, Should come to his ears, then he'd lightly me, And think that I'm scarcely worth seeing again: Sic sad thoughts as these they ga' me wi' pain. But if that kind Providence on us would smile, And cause my dear Jamie to visit this isle, Our former endearments would come to his view; His love and affections perhaps might renew. SONG VI. The Pease Straw. The country swain that haunts the plain, Driving the lightsome plow, At night, tho' tir'd, with love all fir'd, He views the lassie's brow. When morning comes, instead of drums, The flails flap merrilie, To raise the maids out of their beds, To shake the pease strae. Fair Jeany raise, put on her claise; Syne tun'd her voice to sing: She sang sae sweet, with notes complete, Gar'd a' the echoes ring; And a' the males lay by their flails, And dance most merrilie, And bless the hour that she had pow'r To shake the pease strae. The musing swain, disturb'd in brain, Fast to her arms he flew, And strave a while; then, wi' a smile, Sweet Jeany, red in hue, She said right aft, I think you're daft, That tempts a lassy sae; Ye'll do me wrang; pray let me gang And shake the pease strae, My heart, said he, sair wounded be, For thee, my Jeany fair; Without a jest, I get nae rest; By bed it proves a snare. Thy image fine presents me syne, And takes a' rest me frae; And whiles I dream, in your esteem, You reckon me your fae: Which is a sign you will be mine; Dear Jeany, say nae na: But soon comply, or else I dy, Sae tell me, but a flaw, If you can love, for none above Thee I can fancy sae; I would be blest, if I but wist That you would shake my strae. Then Jeany smil'd; said, You're beguil'd, I canna' fancy thee: My minny bauld, she would me scauld; Sae dinna' die for me. But yet, I own, I am near grown A woman: since its sae, I'll marry thee, syne you'll get me To shake your pease strae. SONG VII. My Love she is the Ring-leader To the tune of, The Gallant Shoemaker. You Muses nine, inspire my brain; Likewise I'll invocate Apollo, To furnish me poetick strain, That I may make soft numbers follow; I mean to praise my charming fair, Because that I love none beside her; Her virtue, wit, and prudence rare, Declare that she's the ring-leader. Suppose the fairest nymph alive, Deck'd with the finest robes in fashion, Would use her wits how to contrive In me for her to raise a passion, I'd quickly fly th'enchanting dame, And run to her of whom I'm glader; Because in me she rais'd a flame, She seems to me the ring-leader. Should I compare my dearest Love To goddesses of wit and beauty, Inferior like, they all might move, At her appearance, as their duty. Likewise, the gods might her admire, And watch her, lest some ill betide her; And then pronounce to my desire, That my dear love's the ring-leader. Were great Apollo, with his harp, Set down to sound her praises many, The rural notes, both shrill and sharp, Would all declare they know not any That can compare with my dear Lass; Fine wit and modesty o'erspread her: This character on her I'll pass, My love she is the ring-leader. Great lofty Pope, and Ramsay bright Could ne'er describe her in their verses, Tho' they should rise at every flight, Above all those that love rehearses. She far surmounts the praise of man; No tongue nor pen can right describe her: So take my word, or there's my hand, My love she is the ring-leader. The rural nymphs that tread the green, Due homage they to her surrender; When they at nuptials do convene, Admire her beauty, wit and splendor. All things that make perfection shine, Each one that views her may consider; Their votes may all agree with mine, And say she is the ring-leader. She needs no paranymphs to dress; She's comely as the bright Aurora: She sweetly sings with chearfulness; She's pleasant as the goddess Flora. She's matchless for her constancy; With features base none can deride her: No tongue nor pen, except they ly, Can say but she's the ring-leader. Soft! soft! my Muse, her smiles I see! They put my senses out of order; I'm rapt with wond'ring ecstasy, So that I can't write any further. All I can say seems but to spoil Her praise. Dame Nature has decreed her, The fairest of the fair; and while She lives, to be their ring-leader. SONG VIII. The Summer Evening. To the Tune of, The bonny Bush aboon Traquair. Witness, ye Powers! that do attend My sighs, and stand amazing, And tell if falsehood I pretend, When on her charms I'm gazing. No, no; I scorn so base a crime; Such thoughts need never move her: Eternity shall waste her time, Before I cease to love her. Her smiles, like powerful spells, intraps My wand'ring heart, and binds it; Kind Cupid may wound her; perhaps She'll yield, when as she finds it. O then! my joys will be complete; My wishes at my pleasure: With great delight, whene'er we meet, I'll hug my lovely treasure. But oh! alas! those empty forms, Make me with pain to languish; As sea swains, under furious storms, Are fill'd with grief and anguish; So these ideas that present My fancy, still do move me, Until she yield, with free consent, And say, I dearly love thee. Which sentence, if I once but heard, I'd be more blithe to hear her, Than one from drowning were restor'd; With fondness I'd admire her; And then fly to her bosom fair, And kindly treat my jewel; To every swain I would declare, That she is no more cruel. SONG IX. [On a sweet summer evening, a-walking I went] To the tune of, Thro' the Wood, Laddie. On a sweet summer evening, a-walking I went, At my canny leisure, To view ilka pleasure, To languishing spirits 'twould afforded content; Where flow'rs above measure send forth a sweet scent. Thinks I, what a pleasure dwells in this sweet field, Where Flora dispenses, To pleasure the senses, So sweet and fine odours, contentment to yield, To all whose pretences love a rural field. Then looking around me, I suddenly was Surpris'd by a creature, Whose beauty was greater Than any before I e'er saw in a lass; She had comely features, as she stood on the grass. Then modestly smiling, unto me she said, Swain, Where are you walking, So lazily stalking, In this secret grove? To which I replied, I'm taking my pastime in this pleasant shade. With that, a sharp arrow from Love's fatal bow, It deeply me wounded, There I lay confounded; Senseless with pain, and scarcely could know What was my condition; but my breast it did glow. When, after a little, I recover'd again, Then knew I the matter, How that charming creature Had been all the cause of my former pain; And frankly my passion I 'gan to explain. Dear lassie, said I, by thy lovely charms, I'm robb'd of my senses, As here evidences My fainting, that caused by Cupid's sharp arms; T'enjoy thee, sweet creature, my heart he alarms. Since in this sweet grove I'm wounded by thee, Pray do not disdain me, For that will sore pain me; But rather comply, or let me go free; But it seems thou'rt the lass that's allotted for me. This made the sweet lassie to sigh, and to say, How has Fortune brought me, (When none would have thought me) To walk in the evening, and not in the day? Or how am I happen'd this night in thy way? Said I, with a sigh, but she could not hear, You are the sweet creature, And that is the matter, That in this green shade, on this evening clear; That must be my love, as now doth appear. SONG X. O'er the Muir to Meggy. And I'll o'er the muir to Meggy; Her smiles stir up my passion; All other maids, though ne'er so fine, I'll court but for the fashion. When I'm o'ercome wi' care or grief, Or when a cross torments me, Her smiling face yields me relief, And presently contents me. Her lovely looks chear up my heart, And gars me look ay canty; My vital life will soon depart, Dear Meggy, gin I want thee. Sae dinna break my tender heart, By your unconstant dealing; Your absence proves a grieving smart, And hads my heart ay failing. My heart lyes in her bosom fair; I have it not in keeping; Ilk night I have for her a care, And dream of her when sleeping. Among the croud of nymphs I gaze, With fondness, till I spy her; All my affections turn a blaze, The instant that I eye her. The pleasant tune delights my ear, Call'd, O'er the Muir to Meggie; Her very name gars me forbear To let my thoughts a-vaguing. Let ilka lad aft change his love, For me I'll still be loyal: I never shall my mind remove, Without her flat denial. SONG XI. The Leacher's Lament. To the tune of, John Anderson my Jo. Ilk wanton wench and merry swain, That likes to lilt and sing, And walk about the pleasant plain In time of heartsome spring, If unto Venus ye're inclin'd, Chuse places that's remote; To none but one reveal thy mind, Or else you are a sot. When I was in my youth, my lads, I had nae cross nor care; I laugh'd at feckless careless blades, And courted ay the fair. My love and I did often ly Where pleasant flow'rs did grow; We stood na' on't the game to try, When it came in our row. At last I tauld my mind to twa, Whilk bred me meikle strife; When they at variance did fa', It griev'd me to the life. Ilk ane coost up another's wrang, That scandaliz'd me so, That gar'd me soon forget to gang Where pleasant flow'rs did grow. But now my vitals are decay'd, And runkled is my brow; Small frights they make me soon afraid; My reins are stiff, I trow. The rashness of my youth, I find, Adds twenty to my age: The pleasant hours of Venus kind Kills more than Mars in rage. SONG XII. The amorous Shepherd. Tune, Wat ye wha I met yestreen. Na, Katie winna look sae low, As notice me upo' the green; Haith I am doild, because 'tis so, That she is high and I am mean. But, if the fates wad favour me, And turn her to a lower guise, Or make me rich, that I might be An equal match to my dear prize; With confidence I then wad fly, And court my bonny Katie syne; No mortal monarch's state wad I Think half so bless'd as that of mine. Though I had a' the world wide At my ain government to stand, Nane but my Katie should be bride, Or join with me in Hymen's band. SONG XIII. The ADMIRATION. Tune, Will you go to Fife, Laddie? How did you lear to sing, laddie? Your words do pleasure bring, laddie, Unto my ear, because I hear You're master of the spring, laddie. Sure 'tis a pleasant life, laddie, To be a shepherd's wife, laddie; When void of care, with country fare, They drown all brawls and strife, laddie. I'd be a wife to thee, laddie, From crosses to be free, laddie, Before a lord that could afford Me gold at libertie, laddie. Then we will oft repair, laddie, To take the cauller air, laddie, Upon the braes, free from our faes, Or any subtle snare, laddie. The fat of ky and sheep, laddie, The brooks that softly creep, laddie, Unto the sea, these you and me Shall feed on and syne sleep, laddie. None shall make us afraid, laddie. Kind Fortune, she will spread, laddie, Her favours free on you and me, From evil we'll be freed, laddie. The pleasant flow'rs are fine, laddie, Where you and me shall dine, laddie; The rural boughs shall shade our brows; I'm your's, and you are mine, laddie. SONG XIV. The COMMENDATION. Tune, Have at the Widow, my Laddie. My Johny's a laddie that's lightsome and fair; Few gallants, I think, can wi' him compare; Kind fortune has given him to me for my share. Sae, well's me of my bonny laddie. His face is so lovely, so pleasant he smiles, That many young lassy I'm sure he beguiles; There is none more happy in broad Europe's isles, Than me and my bonny gay laddie. My mother she frown'd, but now she is glad, And loves my sweet Johny; her fury is laid, She gave him her blessing, and all that she had, In a jointure to my bonny laddie. My Johny he's active, couragious and bold; He values not riches, nor silver, nor gold; He's virtuous and constant in love; so I'll hold, Few imitate my bonny laddie. He reads, and he speaks, and he sings with an air, That outstrips the warblers that fly in the air: His sweet charming notes they fully declare The worthiness of my gay laddie. He's heartsome and cheary, and always content; In wisdom and learning, and in merriment, His quiet sober life hereto he hath spent; That fits him to be my sweet laddie. Let ladies of honour chuse gallants that's brave, But should I live single none such I would have; In such a preferment I would be a slave, If robb'd of my bonny sweet laddie. The flocks that he tended may bleat and be wae; The lav'rocks and lintwhites, they a' may be sae, Since he from their company must come away To be my dear love and my laddie. The deserts were homely when he was in them; His music it would make a wild savage tame: For in me it raised a tormenting flame, Till I once enjoy'd my sweet laddie. SONG XV. [In former ages, when] Tune, The Lass of Patie's Mill. In former ages, when Dame Nature bore the sway, All thought 't a pleasure then Her precepts to obey. Love wantonly did play In pure simplicity; His wounding darts made way 'Mong high and low degree. Wit, beauty, virtue, where Young Cupid found these three, He aim'd his arrows there, Through all difficulty: In wealth no merit he, Nor Hymen, ere did place; Unstain'd felicity Shin'd then in every face. A maid upon the plain Could then affection move; Princes would not disdain To chuse such for their love: By int'rest none was drove Gainst Nature's laws to wed; An instinct given by Jove; All by nought else were led. But age and toil, we see, These gods have stupify'd; So that no honesty In all their deeds are spy'd: Old Hymen's knots are ty'd Unequal, now a-days; Wealth beautifies the bride, Though worthy of no praise. SONG XVI. The COMPLAINT. Tune, The East Noo of Fife. Draw near, young men, and hear my plaint, Ye who with laughing merriment Beguile the hurling minutes so, That scarce one year ye think of two. When I was young as well as you, My heart was light and merry too; I courted every charming fair, And slighted every carking care. All day I sang with heartsome glee, And with sweet labour earnestly I purchas'd coin, that I might have A furnish'd fortune to my grave. And all the night I slept full sound, Till little Cupid did me wound; Then all my art I did employ To hasten to the promis'd joy. At markets where I met with lasses, We wantonly carrous'd our glasses: I frankly dealt my fairing too, But ah! these days are past me now. Confin'd at home, wi' churlish want, The sooty Kakers do me daunt; And poverty so curbs my will, I cannot have a pint and jill. But yet my want is not so great, But I might have it at some rate; And heartsomely my penny free Spend frankly with good company. But my wife limits all my time; If I break loose, she banns my wime: And vow she makes an unco fraise; And carps and grumbles two three days. Syne supperless I go to bed; The morn I wake with a fair head; Yet dare not tell, for fear my dame Would put me to a public shame. But since 'tis so that I'm involv'd In such a fate, I am resolv'd To pluck up courage, heart and hand, And make her to her orders stand. Come, let's be jolly, fill again; I'll sit a while, I'm not mistane: And while we blithly slack our drought, Fancy (at least) we're in our youth. I'll reign as king in my empire; That is to say, around my fire; And let the housewife ken I'm free To live, while life is lent to me. Come, here's well may the lads all be, And all the charming lassies too; There's still among the fair as free As any of our sex can be. But let the dull and clumsy queans, Who at true harmony repines, Live in continual frets and groans, With hearts as cold and dead as stones. SONG XVII. The Auld Goodman. One morning of May, by light of the day, As I was walking over the lee, A little near by, I heard a man cry, Alas! alas! what will I do? My wife she is proud, and clamours ay loud; I canna' content her, do what I can: She lends me a gouf, and tells me I'm douf, I'll ne'er be like her last goodman. Oh! had I liv'd single, although with a pingle, I had preserv'd my chastity; I would have liv'd quiet, although sober diet Had been my lot continually: But now, as a slave, my noddle to save, I lout and lour as well's I can; While I'm confus'd, and thus abus'd, Cause I'm no like her last goodman. Oh! had she been young, I might her vile tongue In process of time perhaps have reclaim'd, And made her grow better; but of her ill nature, When we were marry'd, I never dream'd. But great Jove himsel, knows now, as in hell, I belsh out oaths, and curse and ban, When to it I'm furdert, and almost murder'd, 'Cause I'm no like her last goodman. May never poor lad meet wi' sik a bad And crossful wife as I have done; My life is a burden while I'm wi' the lurden; Come death, and haste, and fly, and run, And cut my life's thread, in my extreme need, And carry me safely to the plain, That Jove has assign'd for comfort of mind, Where folk like me forget their pain. Her REPLY. You blame your wife for your poor life; Shame light upon your calf-like face, That plaints on me, when I from thee, Scarce in three months obtain a kiss. You gaunt and groan, in slumber you moan; No active spirit remains in thee; Whilk gars me cry out, and lend thee a rout, You, silly John Snool, a plague to me. You rant and sport 'mong your consort, And make a jest of me your wife; And meikle good gear, whilk, both late and air, My husband wan during his life, You spend; 'tis seen, then late at e'en, You homeward stagger as you can, And tumble to bed, where ony young maid May ly unknown, you calf-like man. You pray that death would cut your breath; Death scarcely thinks you worth his pains, To ware his dart on your dull heart; But if he would, he'd loose my chains. Then would I be quit of you a dead sot, That yields me no pleasure, do what I can: His saul be at rest; I think I was bless'd When living was my auld goodman. SONG XVIII. The FIDELITY. Tune, The bonny Boatman. My pleasant Nymph, thy smiling face Yields to me far more pleasure Than any lass; thy kind embrace Surmounts the greatest treasure. Wert thou my ain, Then I'd disdain All other maids but thee, lass: Pray give consent, Do not torment Me with unconstancy, lass. And if you fancy me, my love, I'll promise thee for ever, Nothing except the Pow'rs above. Our company shall sever: You shall be mine, I will be thine, By Hymen's laws we'll marry: Syne I will kiss Thy bonny face, Dear lass, and winna' spare thee. Euphina, if I were so blest, As have thee for my marrow, Then blithly would I cock my crest Free from all care and sorrow. In rural shades, We'll make our beds, In pleasure and content, love; No care nor toil Shall ever spoil Our rest, if you'll consent, love, To marry me; for in my life On earth I'll have no pleasure, If you deny to be my wife; I'll mourn far out of measure; But if you love, I'll constant prove, None shall make me to alter: Until I die I will deny To change my mind, or faulter. SONG XIX. The forlorn MAID. Tune, Kind ROBIN lo'es me. Upon a morning clear and fair, As I went forth to take the air, I spy'd a lass in great despair, Lamenting most severely. Alas! said she, I am forlorn; To all the town I'm now a scorn; I wish that I had ne'er been born, Since I have lost my lover. He courted me both air and late, And call'd me ay his bonny Kate; But, oh! alas! my wretched fate; I'm ruin'd quite for ever. Alas! woes me! I am wi' bairn; And he is gone, left me forlorn; Now he for me has no concern, Altho' he promis'd fairly. His twinkling eyes, and his sweet breath, Made me forget to dread sik skaith; To wrang me I thought he'd be laith, Yet my thoughts did deceive me. He vow'd and swore, by heavens high, By all the winged fowls that fly, That he would marry me; and I As eithly did believe him. He trysted me one evening fair, Among the groves to take the air; But soon he brought me in a snare; Woes me that e'er I loo'd him. Now I maun beg with this young thing; To pleasure it, with grief I sing; I tear my hair, my hands I wring, For waeness that I loo'd him. My fortune now is cleanly broke, By leaning to that feeble rock; False man that gae me sik a stroke; Sare mayst thou rue thy doings. You virgins, keep your chastitie; To such as him no freedom gi', Lest that you sing along with me, Alas! that e'er I loo'd him, SONG XX. The BANKS of TAY. Tune, Ettrick Banks. The banks of Air, and Ettrick banks, Are sweetly sung among the fair; The former sure deserves no thanks, For Ettrick banks first gave the air. Yet he who sings the banks of Air, Brags proudly of his ancient braes, As nothing with them could compare; But Tay's sweet banks deserve the praise. The rapid river swiftly slides, With pleasant murmurs, thro' the groves, With famous woods on both its sides, Where swains and nymphs disclose their loves; With fertile fields and forests fair, Adorn'd with gow'ny glens and braes, That far surpass the banks of Air, And more, by far, deserve the praise. Both Dukes and Earls our banks do grace; Lords ancient, famous of renown: Here Royal CHARLES, of ancient race, Receiv'd the sceptre, sword and crown. Upon our banks there lives a Lord, Whose title bears Broadalbion; And Murrays, noble by renown, A pillar of the British throne. The Hays, an ancient warlike race, Whose feats of arms have often been With valour shewn in many a place, In many bloody action seen. When bold and proud insulting Danes, Thought all our nation was their prey, One made them leave the Scotian plains; So valiant was that matchless Hay. The Drummonds too, of noble fame, So honourable, great and brave, Alliance to the crown they claim, Upon our banks a lodging have, Enclos'd with woods and gardens fair, That ev'ry month smiles as 'twere May: Blyth Mary walks with pleasure here, And beautifies the banks of Tay. That ancient royal palace, Scoon, Stands on the pleasant banks of Tay; St Johnston, where you'll see the moon On clock-work increase and decay. Here trade and manners flourish fair; Laws and religion equal sway; Nor Irving's holms, nor banks of Air, Can vie with our brave banks of Tay. The Ogilvies, of high descent, Sprung partly from Montgomery's race, Whose valour Fame still represents In that old song of Chevy-chase. Kinnairds, true Scotsmen, much esteem'd Among the brave, the great and gay; They and the Ogilvies are deem'd To beautify the banks of Tay. The Lyons, an heroic race, Whose castle bears their famous name, A beautiful and lovely place, Of regular and comely frame. Their wide extent of fame and state, Takes in that spacious plain Strathmore; Here on our banks, among the great, They share of noble fame and pow'r. The Grays upon our banks do shine, With splendid glories, worthy fame; But oh! my Muse, I want engine To scance upon the ancient name. Let Fame in annals represent The actions of the noble Gray; And Heav'n guard those that resident Here on the pleasant banks of Tay. The Douglases, whose ancestors brave, Shine brightly in records of fame, Upon our banks a title have, That adds a glory to the fame. Here stands the city of Dundee, Where navigation flourish fair, Religion, trade and fishery, Surpassing far the town of Air. Here Macer, Lindsay, Wedderburn, Et cÃ¦tera, knights of high renown, The banks of Tay they much adorn With many famous tow'r and town. The Fyfes and Crawfoords, worthy Grahams, Brave Scotsmen, all deserving praise, Tay's banks can boast of nobler themes Than Ettrick, Air, or Irving's lays. What brisker lads, more lovely swains, Than on the banks of Tay abide? The fairest nymphs sure here remain That's in the universe so wide. All sorts of grain our banks produce, With store of fruits and gardens fair, What's necessary for man's use, Excelling far the banks of Air. An Epitaph on that puissant Duke of Berwick, Great Marshal of France, who, at the siege of Phillipsburgh, viewing the trenches, had his head shot off by a cannon ball, in the year 1734. Here lies his grace, the duke of Berwick, who, With braving courage, scorn'd the raging foe. His warlike arms undauntedly pursu'd His Prince's glory, and his country's good: Till at the siege of Phillipsburgh, sad fate! The fatal moment did him there await! From the artill'ry of the subtile foe, Death flew, and struck his head off at one blow. Had Death but stood so candidly as fac'd him, His valour from the Gaulian coasts had chas'd him. But terror seiz'd the king of terrors so, That, like a coward, behind he struck the blow. CHRIST's KIRK on the GREEN. CANTO IV. To the Reader, After reading the three Cantos of that POEM, the First whereof was composed by no less an Author than a Scottish Monarch; the other Two by-the famous Mr Allan Ramsay; I, out of conceit, attempted to finish, or rather ape that POEM. And considering that Canto First contains the Revels of the Bridal-day, and the Second the Bridal-night, together with the Bedding of the Bride, and the Third what past on the Morrow, or Infare-day, I have endeavoured to Kirk them, and so put away the costly names of Bridegroom and Bride, though not so beautiful as the former. The POEM but falls in a gradual digression, according to the Authors of it, as foresaid. If the World be pleased to reckon me a Third, I shall have my highest wish. A. N. When PhÅbus, wi' his gauden beams, Bang'd in the light of day, And glittering on the silder streams That thro' the valleys stray, The couthy carles, frae their dreams, Began to rax, and say, Up drousy herds; herds PhÅbus blames That made so short a stay Away that day. By that time bells for mass did clink O'er a' the nation round; Wives had tane out their Sunday's wink That morning, lang and sound; Wi' grains and raxing 'gan to blink And vizzy a' things round, Gat up, and gard the kettles chink; For breakfast busy bound Wi' speed that day. Naething was seen twa days afore At Christ's Kirk on the Green, But revellings and battles sore, And dancing hard and keen; The carles did baith rant and roar, And delt some knoits between- Hands; lads their lasses did implore, Greeting wi' baith their een For love that day. The bride was mild as ony lamb Upo' that morning-tide; And love the bridegroom did inflame; His passions wadna' hide, Then Steen, a man of courage, came To kirk bridegroom and bride; Lawrie, Andrew, Dick and Tam, Came banging in at's side Bedeen that day. Then lads and lasses, mony ane, Be that time was come in; The eldren men sat down their lane To wet their throats within: They gat a cheese that weigh'd twa stane, I wat it was na' thin; The lads' bra' knives, hafted wi' bane, Could hardly pierce the skin Of it that day. Quoth Dick, Gin I had here my axe, (For I trow it would take it) I would indent, at three good strakes, My bladder I should break it. Said Hutchon, If your knives inlakes, My durk, let no man lack it, Will soon supply; and, for your sakes, Assunder I shall hack it In sheeds this day. Then all began to chew the cheese, And drink about wi' speed; Wi' mony grievous girn and squeese, The auld folk shook their head, And ban'd their teeth that wadna' bruise, That they might faster feed. Some bit their tongues, until their eyes Sent out their springs, for greed, Or haste that day. Syne pauky Steen drank to the bride, Come, lass, your hanson kelder; For Roger fair confession made Your ma't was i' the melder. At last, her blushes wadna' hide; The lasses speer'd what ail'd her; She in a swarff fell cheek-aside; Auld Mause she ran and held her Upright that day. Ha, quo' the wives, my liken, ken, Or forty ouks be past, 'Twill kyth you ha' been ne'er the men, And Venus' laws embrac'd. I'll warrant we were a' right fain, And ween'd ourselves fu' bless'd, When we got houses of our ain; The pleasures we possess'd Were fine that day. The bells a triple warning gae; Fo'k to the kirk fast flocked; The dowser sort began to say, I trow we've o'er lang joked. Come, drink and eat, and let's away; Some were, thro' haste, ha'f choked; Some clap'd their backs, cry'd well-a-day, While unchew'd bites they bocked Far aff that day. Ilk man and wife, ilk lad and lass, Well buckled i' their claes; A jolly company there was, When to their feet they raise: Fu' handsomely to kirk they pass, Well rank'd in their degrees; To flee the fair nane was sae fa'se, Sae fond were they to please The bride that day. The auld men, at their civil crack, Went on afore the rest; The bridegroom he came at their back; The bride she followed fast; The lads their lasses hands did ta'k, Love's passion sae them press'd; A bonny sight to see them wa'k In gray and tartan dress'd, All gay that day. By dinner-time the mass was done; They hameward high'd wi' speed; Dick, scarce well set, cry'd for a spoon; It was his end to feed. Then on a board they set fu' soon, Some barley-broth and bread; And syne brought in, for their disjoon, Auld Brucky's feet and head, Well sung that day. Though some wi' nevels had sare snouts, A' byganes were neglected; Fell fresh to birle, and drink like trouts, Nae poortoth they suspected; Ilk ane forga' their former routs, New 'greements they erected; Good ale and usque ga'd about, In healths, as they respected Their friends that day. The sutor said, Here's to the health Of thir new-married couple; I wish them meikle joy and wealth, Lang clever, strong, and souple. Their pleasure now is without stealth; The bridegroom winna' scruple To tell his bosom-friend what ail'th Him, though he tak' the ripple On her some day. Wives wi' the drink began to tattle About the bridal-day, How dancing turned to a battle, How Jack began the fray; How arrows flew, and clubs did rattle, And some ha'f-fell'd there lay; How Bessie bald came wi' a brattle, Wi' her knife to geld or slay Them fast that day. Some said, Tam Taylor lay stane still Till a' the fray was done; To rin and redd he had na' will, He thought it was o'er soon. The minstrel fairly tint his skill, For he fell through ilk tune; Ran in atween twa wains, and full He pish'd his ain twa shoon, For fear that day. The cow'rdly carles burnt for shame To hear how they had acted; The miller's wife ga' them the blame Her husband was sae hacked. Then spake up Dick, I fear, good dames, Wi' drink your harns are cracked; Men's characters, and they frae hame, Some mare should be respected By you this day. Tam Luter said, Dick had the wyte, By any in the town, For fighting was na' his delight, Till a' the lave were done. Then Dick, wi' anger and despite, Cry'd, Let me to the lown; You piper dog, I say be quiet, Or I shall tak' you down Belyve this day. Whisht, quoth the miller, what's a' this? Are cowards begun to flyte? A bonny story, troth, it is, To see your girning spite: To blast and brawl ye canna' miss, And kens not wha's 'o wyte; But, gin ye winna' be at peace, Ye's get a bane to bite Upon some day. Come, quo' the smith, Let's drink about, The bride's health maun gae round; The bridegroom's niest, there is na' doubt, Maun u'most ay be found. Quoth a', the smith is unko stout, And his purse hingers bound; But, ere we part, we's ripe it out, And gar him pay fu' sound For's cracks this day. Bridegroom and bride are costly names; When married fo'k's ance kirked, They need na' mare be fash'd wi' them; The smith wants to be jirked. Come, let us here a court proclaim, And fine him as he's worked; With that he thought black burning shame, And down his head he lurked Fu' low that day. Had up your head, auld Hutchon cry'd, You silly simple sot; What? like a coward, your manhood hide Sae for a poor gray groat. Your wife sae bald, and fu' of pride, She wears the breeks, I wot; She'll soundly buff you back and side; I wish she spare your throat Uncut this day. When a' was done, young Roger he Cry'd, Fill me up a gill; To my frank neighbours heartsomelie I'll drink wi' hail good will: The smith and his thrawn wife maun 'gree, Tho' they scald ne'er sae ill; Bairns unborn 'bout them and me Will crack when at the ale, And laugh some day. An Epistle to Mr P?, one of his Majesty's Officers of Excise, on his ridiculing my Verses. Sir, Suppose grammarians, such as you, write fine, Immortalizing heroes in each line; Yet who's to thank you? Sure it's ne'er be me; Your education natural wants supplie. Homer and Horace, when the world was young, They then invented several sorts of song, As Nature taught them, in their mother-tongue. Like to a shepherd on the rural plain, Who tunes his sang amidst the rustic train; His fellows praise him for his soft sweet voice; The flocks they listen, seeming to rejoice. The milking maids lay down their pails and dance, When to the fold he whistling doth advance: His charming voice sounds in their ears, till they Acquire the tune, and lilt it o'er next day. Though you who have poetic art survey'd, The Latin tongue, and many authors read, Compose fine numbers in heroic style; 'Tis but mere imitation all the while. But new invention, such as Homer had, And in their mother-tongue, as Horace did: Purely they wrote, each as dame Nature taught; Their works new wit, new fancy, and new thought. But we must have supplies from other parts, Or shamefully we will mismanage arts: We learn the modes, and languages, and rules, Or else we look like stupid brutish fools. Some brutes they are so docile, that they will Incline, and ape men's actions to the full. But few of men, though they can read and write Their native language, are in one art complete, Especially in poetry, who can, In homely lays, both style and numbers scan? I ne'er admire the learned, though they scance On style and numbers, and fine verse advance; For though the genius should decline, they might, E'en force their way, in making verses right. The warbling quire that ushers in the spring, All know they by a natural instinct sing; And so do I, though never, all my days, Was ever master of one Latin phrase. Though I may nibble at the lowest sprays, I cannot climb to touch the lofty bays. A Letter to J? B? an old Batchelor, persuading him to marry. In frosty weather sheets are cauld, That gars folk closs together fauld. In spite of ilka northern blast, The heat of man and wife shall last. But single lads, like you and me, Maun slide our sarks down o'er our knee; And heat the tae foot wi' the other: What can we do in winter weather? But when the spring and summer comes, When midges dance, and ev'-cloke bums, The man and wife in bed grows warm; The sweat and heat it does them harm. So troth, my friend, I'm at a vary, Whether to keep free, or marry. But yet I have devis'd a wile, The heat of summer to beguile; That is, to keep claes aff the bed, Until the summer heat be fled: And when the' autumnal cald comes in, To hap the bed we'll then begin. Sae gin I had as many years As on your forehead now appears, Some comely fair-one, wi' 'er enticements, Would cause me cast off all advisements, And fairly venture on the tie Of marriage; purposely that I Frae all reproaches should go free, And wanton women's calumny. For they will taunt, and jeer, and joke, And ca' you capon, not a cock; An auld young man that canna' love; A silly fool, as chaste's a dove; Row'd in the brottlet when first seen, And chiefly lo'es his cog sinsyne. With many such reproaches more, Lasses gi' lads that they abhor. Sae take a heart, and learn to woo', That lasses may speak well of you. Brush up your beard, goose out each lirk, And gi' some change to K?'s kirk. Do as your father did, and strive To keep the name of B?ce alive. Sure there is great delight in wooing, 'Tis sic an ancient way of doing: For since auld Adam first was made, His bairns, till now, have us'd the trade. Therefore, my friend, I'd have you try What pleasure's in't, and sae shall I. Wedlock's a divine institution; Sae let us, with one resolution, Obey that sacred old comman', That God in Paradise gave man. Leave parents, friends, and a' your kin, Some bonnie lassie's love to win; And cleave to her for life to live; That will your sunken sp'rits revive. Farewell, my friend; gin ye be wise, You winna' slight my young advice. I own indeed, it is but bruckle, Yet gi'en in love. Your's, Sandy Nicol. Written by a Gentleman upon seeing some of my Verses. Alexander, Thou little bard, of Adam's brood, Had thy education been as good As natural genius leads thee, Thy station now had been much better Than nolt-herd, or a shepherd either; And as well vers'd in natural matter, A poet they had made thee. My ANSWER. Sir, I'm one of ancient Adam's race, Though in the lowest rank and place Dame Nature she has set me; Yet Heav'n gae me a spacious mind, Beyond a hantle o' my kind; The rural muses too, I find, Do fondly daut and pet me. For, mony time, when I thought lang, Thalia brought a past'ral sang, And bade me chear my heart, And let the warld ken that we Regard not learning's high degree; But unto poets naturallie Our secret we impart. My station, though 'tis poor and mean, Yet for no higher pitch I green Than Providence allows; But only, Sir, that I'm inclin'd, (If fortune she would be so kind), To see my verse in print; my mind Ambitiously pursues. An Epistle to Mr Allan Ramsay. SIR, Your name and fame has spread sae far off, I doubt 'tis mare than I'm aware of; For troth, Sir, I maun tell ye, Your head's sae fu' of canty tales, That scoups o'er many muirs and dales, Likewise in ilka valley, That I'm amaist made to sing dumb, And break my quill asunder; And naething say, but maunt and mum, When you begin to thunder Out mony things, and bonny things, That's ilka ane's delight, That ae man, nor nae man, Your canty tales can slight; But praise them ay for wally droll; He's but a fool that will control Your witty wanton verse; For a' the poets o' the nation May come unto your coronation, And ay your praise rehearse. Some with laurel, some with bays, To crown your Laureat, And say, Haith Allan has bright rays That shine aboon our pat. Our quills a', and wills a', Can never reach so far; He thinks ay, and blinks ay, Bright as the clearest star. When I came hame, ilk ane came speering, I scarcely cou'd gi' them an hearing, They were sae unca busie. Said they, O Sandy, saw you Allan, And was you in within his dwelling? Pray tell us what like is he? Said I, my memory is nae meikle, To tell you a' his marks; Read's epistle to's friend Arbruckle, Set down amang his warks: He shaws a' his laws a', And principles ilk ane; His stature and nature, He tells it till Amen. I would be unca well content, To see my writings put in prent, And syne hae them to read. I pray you, send me word about it; For ilk ane says, they deadly doubt if, That ever they will be it. Yet I do bid them thole a while, Till ance the spring come in; They'll gar ye a' baith laugh and smile, Till water your eyes blin. When linking and clinking, You see them thro' ilk shire; Syne sma' folk, and a folk, Will buy them wi' desire. A. Nicol. Said on WRITING. There's nothing for writing, this world's so hard, Excepting it be the d?l ha'ed for reward. I dare not write satire, tho' in it there's wit, And in this our age no subject's so fit. If I write on a country-man, anger breaks out; He threatens to give me my bones in a clout. Be it satire or praise, he foolishly swears, That he will have none of my doggrel verse. And if on an Earl, a Lord, or a Knight, They all turn critics, to judge if 'tis right. Its faults soon appear, its beauty's conceal'd; No more's for the author, except he's revil'd. And if on a groom that has manners and sense, He gives me a bottle, my pen to compense. So this is the fate of a poet that's bad; Tho' more is expected, there is no more had. To write for diversion, no time I can spare; So therefore such writing I had best forbear. Yet sometimes, when fancy provokes me, I must Write something, altho' my labour be lost. An Epistle to a Friend newly married, against the will of his Wife's Friends. Kind Friend, Dear, kind, and loving comerade, I'm sure, as e'er a body had; And gin the warld shou'd a, gae mad, I'll ay say that Thou art a well-deserving lad, Fu' well I wat. But, honest auld acquaintance, now There is a change on me and you; And clashes pass'd, and that nae few, Upon us baith: But Heaven will gi' them their due That wish our skaith. The rising hills, and valleys wide, Our company they now divide; Besides a' that, you've gotten a bride To kiss and clap: I wish naething but good betide, Or be your hap. Your match is nane aboon your thumb, Though a'her kin shou'd glour and gloum, And swell wi' ire, until their bum Like thunder roar; She's your equal now in time to come, As well's before. Sae live contentedly together, In mutual love to one another; And value neither friend nor brother But do your best: Kind Providence, which brought you hither, Makes out the rest. Let ilka tattling ill bred block, Frae house to house still keep a troak Daily, of lies to loose the pock; Sae poor's their post, They'll rin the risk Heav'n to provoke, And damn their ghost. Sae never mind that graceless crew, That speaks nae good but of a few; For what they say is seldom true, Or for good ends: Of a' our wrangs we may na' now Hope for a mends. Take up a heart, and fear nae loss; Be blithe, and laugh at ilka cross; Fate will your enemies oppose; You need na' dread The least affront frae a' your foes; Peace will succeed. May a' the charms of love and youth, And a' the fruits of peace and truth, With heavenly blessings in a fouth, Show'r on your pate; May you a Boaz, and she a Ruth, Still imitate. Farewell. To the Laird of ABERCAIRNIE. Honoured Sir, I've frankly drunk your Honour's heal, Of Andrew Grimmand's laughing ale; And, for your kindness, I'll be bail, I'se gratefu' be: And then you winna' think it ill Bestow'd on me. Bless'd with a long and hearty life; Free of ill humour, care, or strife; A blithe and charming canty wife To be your mate; Of health and riches always rife, Still be your fate. Could my dull muse but clink the rhyme, Free of offences, or a crime, I wad nae grudge how meikle time I took to raise The beauteous stanza of your fame, Or yet your praise. Upon our jolly Change-Keeper leaving the place. Now we may greet when Bacchus frowns: Douf Dulness all our meetings crowns; Our hearty, blithe, and chearful host Has left us all in drouth to toast. He was the jest of all our plays, And swagger'd wide on bridal days. When buckled nymphs met on the green, He soon drew to him a' their een; He bobb'd, wheel'd round, skipt here and there, In sportive doubles, fleet as air. Then wisely cry'd, lest he should fail, To fetch a swinging pot of ale. Sweet son of Mirth! for, on the spot, He'd fling the swats plump down his throat: And wisely reckon'd they were bless'd That pay'd and drank, and danc'd and kiss'd. A narrow-hearted logger-head, He pray'd that drouth might be his dead. When sauls of larger size he met, He bless'd his stars, and thank'd their fate. But this same man, however good, Has left, ah! left this neighbourhood. A Tale of two Brothers, and their Posterity. Doubtless the pleasure is as great In being cheated, as to cheat. Hudibras. Two ancient brothers, famous of renown, Admir'd by all in country and in town; These two increas'd to such a multitude, That one another they at last withstood, Ambitious both to have the sole command, Each striving still to have the upper hand. Cardinia, the bravest brother, seem'd, O'er all the world he was best esteem'd: His valiant sons, where-e'er they came, were known; Such warlike actions by their hands were shown. Free, independent, 'bove two thousand years Successively, our Hero's royal peers Reign'd uncontroll'd, in spite of en'mies power: A foreigner was ne'er his governor. The chiefest son wore an imperial crown; The rest were subjects, loyal to the throne. A lion fierce his royal 'Scutcheon fill'd, Whose rampant paws a blooming thistle held. In fair Edina was the royal seat, And finest Tartan was the coat of State. They scorn'd the Romans, and the Saxon race, And warlike Danes they often put to chace: The Picts extirped freely from the land, Enjoy'd their freedom with victorious hand. What-e'er attempts their freedom to invade, By foreign pow'rs, or en'mies, e'er was made, They firmly stood, unmoveable as rocks; Their force gigantic, none durst bide their strokes. Their privileges, liberties and laws, Their nation's int'rest, and the royal cause; These were the motives push'd our Heroes on: All sought the glory of the ancient Throne. Conquer, victorious, was their word and cry; With loud huzza's o'erpower'd the enemy, Druina was the other brother's name; Not much oblig'd to victory or fame. The Romans, Saxons, Normans, and the Danes, All clapt on him (poor man) their conquering chains. A mixed race, sprung partly from them all, Holds now the pow'r, whose 'scutcheon is the Mole. By gift, or for embellishment, they chose, To grace their banners, a bright spreading rose. Lud is the palace, place and residence Of all their kings, each law and ordinance. Their royal race, at last extinct, they laid Their diadem upon a maiden's head That was ally'd unto Cardinia near: She dying, left one of his sons her heir. They were so subtile, when they saw their strength Upon Cardinia ne'er prevail'd, at length They used flatt'ry to attain their end, And promis'd fair to be his lasting friend. Not only friendship, but rewards of gold, A bait they knew the covetous would hold. We are thy brethren, the Druinians cry'd, More near ally'd since our queen Maiden dy'd. Your prince is ours, by free accession crown'd, And we allow you are the most renown'd. Unite the Thistle and the Rose together, Since we are both under one nursing father. You shall be free to trafic in our land; All that we have shall be at your command. Let prince and parliament stay here in Lud, Then ye'll have access to our chiefest good. In your Edina, for the civil law, Place deputies to keep the land in awe: And for each shire, elect, to represent The same, fit persons in the parliament. Your manufactories, and your cattle trade, Shall, by our help, be far more richer made. Then the Cardinians bravely made reply, We know your flatt'ry, and your treachery. Do you intend, as false designing knaves, To make us free-men your depending slaves? No. We disdain it; and our aweful swords Shall, by our actions, verify our words. Our parliaments, and civil laws, they shall Have their old place within Edina's wall. Let our great Prince the royal scepter sway O'er you and us, and both the courts survey. Yet, notwithstanding, if you seem content, A correspondence, in each parliament, Betwixt us, we will willingly allow; But not to quit our ancient rights to you. Our Prince is now your rightful sovereign; Submit to us, if ye would friendship gain. When the Druinians heard this, they forbore Such treating terms with the Cardinians more. At last, ambassadors from heav'n were sent. Bidding the King to quit the government. Then shortly he exchang'd his diadem With heavenly glory and immortal fame, His royal heir with pomp and splendor crown'd, Chiefs of both tribes the ancient throne surround. Yet the Druinians cunningly began A stratagem against the royal clan. They bred up factions, headed by old Noll; The priests and people royal pow'r control. Their king they murder'd, banished the prince; Which bred confusions 'mong the tribes e'er since. At last, the males of royal seed fell short; A female sway'd the base promiscuous court. Then the Druinians, false as hellish fiends, Thought fittest now to gain their selfish ends: Like the old serpent, cunning to ensnare, Thought best, at first, t'assault the royal Fair. Madam, say they, our all is in thine hand; Our lives and fortunes are at thy command. We want your judgment in one simple case, Namely, twixt us and the Cardinian race. We all are brethren, also neighbours near, And o'er us both, you the great scepter bear. What need we keep so diff'rent from each other, Since we are both under one nursing mother? May we not join us both in unity, Under the conduct of your majesty? Their manufactories, and their cattle trade, Surely by this would richer far be made. We seek not int'rest, honour, or renown, Nor to suppress, or keep Cardinia down. But is't not strange, that we thus tempt the gods, That, being brethren, live so long at odds? Your majesty, if this proposal please you, As well it may, for 'twill more highly raise you In foreign fame, and subjects loyalty, The only hinge of pow'r and royalty; May not (we say) your majesty rehearse This treaty, to the bold Cardinian race? You see advantage by it would accrue, If this were settled, both to them and you. We know they are a stout heroic clan, And scorn to be beholden unto man. But, in this case, we'd stand each others friend, And rest unconquer'd to the world's end. As the fair sex, since mother Eve, sustain'd A yielding temper, and is easy gain'd By fraudulent and false delusive speech; So those the Fair, the royal Fair did reach. So soon as Eve forbidden fruit did taste, She invites her husband to the fatal feast, Involves themselves, and their posterity, In temp'ral loss, and endless misery. The Queen o'ercome, she call'd a parliament, Where she declares how well she was content To have the brothers join'd in unity; Have both one manners, both one laws obey. With secret bribes of pure and stamped gold, In handfulls, hatfulls, numberless, untold, Crafty Druinians laid, as baits, to gain Simple Cardinians to their servile chain. Some, whose estates with equipage were wasted, And purses with extravagancies blasted, Grew covetous to have the shining mould; Their liberties, themselves and nation sold. They snatch'd the bait, because the hook was hid; Thus the Cardinians shamefully deny'd Their wonted freedom, willingly betray'd. When they had sign'd and seal'd the fatal band, Involv'd themselves, and all their native land, Fast in the snare, their wretched heirs espy'd The baneful hook that in the bait lay hid. It firmly sticks in their dejected jaws: The rampant Lyon fears the ugly claws Of the foul Mole, as some infernal fiend. Altho' divines say hellish fiends are chain'd, Yet, when licens'd to wander on the earth, They frighten mortals almost unto death; So now the Mole from under ground gets eyes, And ghostly glares; the Lyon fears, and flies. The very breath of that foul nauseous beast, Poisons the strength of the proud Lyon's crest. His paws are firmly into fetters ty'd; His wonted pow'r all stented and deny'd. What-e'er the Mole bids, the poor Lyon must, Spite of his teeth, perform the same in haste. The Thistle now is pricked with the Rose; The hook is now in the Cardinian's nose. By force compell'd to tax and tribute, who, In former ages, did no taxing know. Commodities must now to Lud be borne, And cheaply sold, or home again return. What the Druinians pleases to impose On the Cardinians, they dare not oppose. The AUTHOR's Wish. A healthy body, and a conscience clear; A moderate draught of small untainted beer When I am dry. When hungry, swoons and pottage; A little garden, and an able cottage. In summer-time a good milk-mother-cow; My choice of books, and nought but read to do. In winter-time a piece fat beef to tottle; And now and then with friends a hearty bottle. A cleanly house; a warm clear canty fire; Clean linens, and my garments all entire. A warm soft bed; a virtuous spouse, and kind; Some pocket-money; these can please my mind. When death approaches, not to dwine, but die; And, after death, bless'd with felicitie. These are my wishes; and I crave no more: If Heaven grant them, Goodness I'll adore. On FORTUNE. O cruel Fortune! and unkind! Unconstant is thy wheel; Thou yield'st to few content of mind; B' experience I feel. Sometimes thy favours they pervert The judgments of the wise; Till oft, too late, they feel the smart From thy false gifts arise. He's only wise that can improve Thy smiles or frowns for good; Such wisdom cometh from above, Thy juggles to exclude. Upon the fair Sex. Hail, gen'rous Fair, who have reviv'd a thought I have retain'd since Nature first me taught. The fair inspire; ambitiously I long To write on them a panegyric song. Were my dull muse but able to indite, My artless fingers would be swift to write The numberless endowments of the sex, Whose beauty none save idiots neglects. I am surpris'd to see unthinking men, Against the Fair, in satire, lift a pen, Who are the hinge of love and generation, The master-piece of Nature and Creation. Man first of dust, or of red earth was made; The woman built of that dust purify'd; Of rarer form, more beautiful and kind; More like to Jove; for Jove's all love, we find. They are more colder in their constitutions Than hated man; and so their dispositions More temp'rate are; in them all virtues dwell; In modesty and softness they excel. Man made without, but she in Paradise; In many things she has pre-eminence. Sure man is of a bold and rugged nature, Whereas the Fair's a soft and tender creature. The seeds of love, of pity, and compassion, Lodge in their breasts, while men are fill'd with passion. Sure Heaven foresaw an inconveniencie Would happen in the human progenie. This world had been an ill-governed theatre, If both the sexes had retain'd one nature. The fair-ones' eyes speak winning eloquence; Their charming smiles an easy access gains To all the corners of their husband's mind, And calms them when they rashly are inclin'd. Though vice, ill-nature, luxury, and toil, The gen'ral mass of human creatures spoil; Yet, 'mongst the best, sprung from a race refin'd, Whose noble blood sure elevates the mind To virtuous ends; and, by their prudence, sway O'er common mortals taught how to obey, Ten thousand beauties with perfections meet To make their charms and innocence complete. Nay, all the virtues shine forth in their charms, While their soft breast their husband's bosom warms. Their outward form adorn'd by art, they seem Each as an angel, or bright seraphim, Whose dazzling glories darken vulgar sight, Like Sol's bright rays in his meridian height. Their ev'ry part most obviously declare Beauty and charms united in the Fair. The comely feet that nimbly do advance, And swiftly swim while Cloe treads the dance; Thence to the waist a modest vail suppresses, And hides from sight those dear forbidden places. As when at noon, in a warm summer day, The glorious sun his splendid beams display, So that no eye, tho' ne'er so strong, can gaze, Unless turn'd blind, on his meridian rays; So these vail'd places cannot see the day; They'd outshine the sun, and chace the light away. Up from the waist, to where two mounts arise, A vail betwixt where wanton Cupid lies, These mounts contain two fountains on their tops, Whose water's sweeter than the nectar drops. Yet these two founts are closely seal'd, till she Be made a mother of a progenie. The ivory neck, as Atlas, up it bears A heaven of beauty in its various spheres. The comely chin more sweets and beauty yields, Than all the fragrance of the verdant fields, Above it stands an oracle of worth, That soon the longing lover's fate speaks forth; Surpassing that of Delphos, which, of old, In rustic rhymes its dark responses told: 'Tis guarded with a ruddy two-leav'd gate; Within it stands twice sixteen knights of state, Invulnerable, harness'd with ivory plate. O pleasant accent! sweet melodious voice! That charms all nature, makes all men rejoice; Proceeding forth from this sweet hollow cave, Such powerful sounds that can both kill and save. The nose, the brow, the blushing cheeks, and eyes, With beauty strike all mortals with surprize. Their ev'ry part with nat'ral magic charms, With secret virtue draws men to their arms. Yet their fair forms are nothing, when compar'd With those perfections wherewith they are stor'd. The fairer virtues beautifie the mind, And darken those externally that shine. The fair-one's virtues, innocence, and worth, Inspir'd a monarch's pen to set them forth. PROVERBS, Chap. xxxi. Verse 10. Illustrious Fair, to virtue all inclin'd, Thrice happy he that such an one doth find. The gold of Ophir, and the coral fine; The topaz, and the silver from the mine; Onix, rich rubies, were they ne'er so rise, Are all inferior to a virtuous wife. In her the husband placeth all his trust, Because he knows she cannot be unjust. He needs not spoil, for she procures him all; Whate'er he wants is at his nod or call. She does him good; when he surveys her charms, The sparks of love that's in his bosom warms. Where virtue lives, true constant love attend, And holds for certain to the latter end. She seeketh wool; she seeketh flax; of both She makes all sorts of necessary cloth. Nay, unconstrain'd, her hands she doth apply To constant labour, working chearfully. Like to the ships where merchants traders are, She brings her food and living from afar. She riseth early, ere the day come in, And calleth up her serving-maids to spin. At mail-time she is careful still to give To each a portion whereupon to live. Well knew she what incessant labour yield; She sums her product; then she buys a field. Behold the genial vines upright do stand, In order rang'd by her successful hand, Indulgent Heaven such durence deigns to crown; Each virtuous step computes her high renown. She girds her loins, hard labour to endure, And states her progress by her growing store. She tastes the sweets of this laborious run, And fingers profit at a borrow'd sun. Distaff and spindle she alternate moves; They speak her actions, and she still improves. With pitying eyes she views the starving race; Like Heav'n she's free, impartial in her grace. With open hands unfolds her gen'rous care; Exactly knows both when to give, and where. From northern coasts the chilling colds may blow, And crust the fields with glazing ice and snow. She scorns the storm's tumultuous parade; With finest scarlet all her house are clad. Of tapestry rich coverings she makes; Pure silk and purple for her clothes she takes Her husband's known among the elders, when He's in the gates, or walks the street with men. She makes fine linen, clean and purely drest, To foreign merchants, from the East and West, She selleth it, gives girdles of the same; They through their land spread her deserving fame. Incompass'd round with servants, valiantly They keep and guard her from all injury. Cloath'd as it were with strength and honour, she Shall still rejoice in her felicitie. And when she speaks, her wisdom is display'd With more applause than the Tritonian maid. She acts and speaks with such a modest grace, A law of kindness from her mouth doth pass. Affairs at home she carefully inspects; Her serving-maids she cautions and directs, Wool how to order, how the flax to dress. She eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children's 'tentive; when she calls they fly; All her commands run swiftly to obey. Her children rise, and her they blessed call; Her husband also, and they praise her all. She's virtuous unto whom all standers by This ancient Motto truly can apply, Full many daughters have done virtuouslie; Yet there is none but what's excell'd by thee. Favour's deceitful; Beauty is but vain; But she alone that fears the Lord shall gain Peace, riches, honour, joy and friendship all, As fruits that from her blessed hands do fall. Give her thereof, and these shall make her great; Yea, her own works shall praise her in the gate. The honest Country-man's Meditation, as he was humming it over alone in Words at Resting-time. Fortune, that with malicious joy, Does man her slave oppress, Proud of her office to destroy, Is seldom pleas'd to bless. Dryden. Faith flies, and piety in exile mourns; And justice, here oppress'd, to heav'n returns. Dryden. If fate's a goddess, as some think she is, I'm made to wonder; and my wonder's this, Why she unequal deals her gifts, and why, What she once gave, she takes from some away? Why she bestows her wealth and pow'r to some, That, by extraction, from the dunghill come; While some that are of noble birth and breeding, Are turned poor, nay slaves their wants deriding? But some men say, this goddess she is blind, And deals at rovers to all human kind. Howe'er it is, I know not; yet I know Some are advanc'd, while others are brought low. Some men have pow'r, yet want the skill to guide it; And some have wit, and yet oblig'd to hide it. Some men are rich, and others wretched poor; And some are chaste, while others play the whore. Some are religious, others are profane; And some have loss, while other some have gain. Some men are patient under th'greatest cross; And some are grieved at the smallest loss. Some men are false, some love to keep their words; And some are valiant, other some are cowards. Some men are born to ease and much content; And some to sorrow, grief and discontent. Some men oppress, while others are oppress'd; Some have hard labour, other some have rest. Some men have sickness, other some have health; Some penury, and some abound in wealth. Some bountiful, and others churlish are; And some are catch'd, while some escape the snare. Some merry make, while other some are sad; And some are good, while other some are bad. Some are shamefac'd, and others impudent; And some are harden'd, other some repent. Some loyal subjects, others rebels prove; And some men hate what others greatly love. Some are ambitious, some their honour flies; And some accept, while others gifts despise. Some men are virtuous, others drown'd in vice; And some are sluttish, other some are nice. So many men, so many dispositions; So many stations, so is their conditions. The covetous, when pow'r is on their side, Are great oppressors, tyrants full of pride; And mainly those that are of mean extraction, When they get wealth, it fills them with distraction. There's farmer Hob from small beginnings rose; But some alledge the fellow found a pose; Or stoll'n or robb'd, or murder'd some for gold; And twenty stories 'bout his wealth are told. Yet there's no man dares to attest the crime; And few, or none, know how it is in time. As he grows rich, he covets still the more; And to his utmost persecutes the poor. Around him, he with covetous design, His thriving neighbours strives to undermine. He views their seats, runs to the landlord syne; Invites him frankly to a treat of wine, Some bottles empty, he proposeth next, Before his sermon, to give out his text. Sir, I'm inform'd some of your tenants are Behind the hand, and in your books too far; And if they fail in payment, Sir, to you, They cannot have sufficient beasts to plow. This dyvers both your honour's land, and them, And you have none, Sir, but yourself to blame. Let me but have, Sir, such and such possessions, I'll try my hand to make some more progressions: With stronger oxen plow up their reversions. Here's gold at will, Sir, for your present use, For I can spare it till the ground produce Her yearly payments by the bullock's toil, Which fails not, when well plow'd in fatted soil. Some golden pieces gratis he lets fly, And then the landlord makes a kind reply; Since you are wealthy, frank, and so discreet, Come, let's strike hands, the bargain is complete. The good old tenants are kick'd out of doors, And turn'd to begg'ry by such sons of whores. Next, there's Alexis, an expectant heir, With pockets scrimpt, yet brisk and debonair; His daily prayer is, That's obstructers may By death be soon and shortly swept away. Indulgent Heav'n his earnest wishes grants, He swears, and swaggers, drinks, and whores and rants; Exhausts his substance, domineering still O'er his poor tenants, subject to his will; By Fortune flatter'd, basely turns uncivil; His subjects dread, he's an incarnate devil. With harrage, carriage, them he still molests; And with extravagance his 'state he wastes. Light come, thinks he, then lightly let it go; If I be serv'd, I value't not a straw. When all's near spent, his pocket empty grown, 'Tis ready cash and credit almost flown, 'Tis cruel mind with tyranny and pride, Runs on oppression, penury to hide; Sends for his tenants, man by man, and swears, Their tenements too great a product bears; You must pay entries ev'ry one, or flit; And more by year; now chuse what ye think fit. Then, in this strait, the simple tenants try; Thus they are both reduc'd to poverty. This breaks all those his tenants that succeed, And his poor heirs must labour for their bread. There's upstart burghers, pedlars-once, now grown Admir'd in country, have the vogue in town; They look a-squint upon the auld goodman, That once were fain to lick his pottage-pan. These cunning callands they corrupt the rest, With crafty counsel, bent for interest. Commodities that's from the country brought, They, with one bod, buy up almost for nought: And what they sell, their tongues are one again; Thus they make rich, beguiling countrymen, Tho' on their souls they bring a guilty stain. There's Mr John probationer devout, With his black sleeves, and military coat; Well-vers'd in logic and philosophy, Fraught with harangues, and blads of orat'ry, But most a stranger to divinity; Yet seeming grave, before the clergy stoops; But, when alone, he sings and takes his cups: Yet he can pray, and tell long scrifts of Greek, And broken smatters of the Hebrew speak; And in the Latin he is nicely read; Can scrape and jouk; then is not he well bred? Having profess'd community and faith, By deed of synod, he a licence hath To preach and pray in public auditory; Tho' ostentation, heart-pride, and vain-glory, Should be his motives, next to gaining bread, He turns Boanerges, shaking hands and head. Some benefice falls vacant; he essays Oft in that place to spread his gospel-rays. Fain would he be the pastor if he might; The stipend fainer by a legal right. The people not unanimous to chuse him, The greatest part enirely do refuse him. He gains the patron; gets a presentation; And this fills some with greater indignation; Yet this installs him pastor of the parish; A great deal more the fleece than flock to cherish. He thus ordain'd, and settled in's possession, His mind runs on another alteration, A finer house, a well-dung'd glebe and garden; But on his studies he is not so arden: With long harangues, tautologies and nonsense, He lulls asleep his silly hearers' conscience. A fine rich wife, and gallant horse to ride; A lazy chair near by his chimney-side: Hath various dishes on his table set; Drink and tobacco heaves him up with fat, More like a swine well-fatted for the knife, Than watchful pastor in a Christian life. I leave their end and fate to him that knows; But this prognostic no good ending shows. These are but swatches of the great oppression, And impositions that o'erspread the nation. Oppression is a god, that's, at this day, Ador'd by all, whose nod all ranks obey. The golden age and silver age are gone; And brass and iron; now is the age of stone. Among the great, where noble blood inspires, To imitate the virtues of their sires, They dare not out them for a perverse crew; That's most in vogue, experience can shew. If priests or poets should their thoughts unfold, They are corrupted with rewards of gold, Or charg'd and persecute their place to hold. But flatt'ry, gains, or praise, altho' misplac'd, True honesty, and truth are both defac'd. But if a scribler, as they call them, say, The stoney age is extant at this day, He's persecuted, scorn'd, reproach'd by all; Such poor rewards to tell-truths now befall. Thirty Riddles, with their Expositions. I. I'm brighter than the radiant beams That from the sun do fly; From mis'ry nothing man exeems, Save my society. Exp. Spiritual virtue. II. I'm one of four that well agree Men to accommodate; Yet, if my bounds exceeded be, Men I would ruinate. Exp. Fire. III. God he once bade a thing be done, And yet he did forbid it; It was not done; yet there was none More lov'd than he that did it. Exp. Abraham offering his Son. IV. A family of five, I hear, Dwelt in a house together, And two of them, as doth appear, Had each of them a mother, Grand-father, father, uncle, aunt, A brother, and a sister; All this is true; and Truth, all grant, No mortals can resist her. Exp. Lot's family in the cave. V. In days of yore I was but one, But now in number more; Though one cannot increase alone, Yet I exceed threescore. Exp. Language in the ark. VI.

I have twelve sons, and ev'ry son Had thirty daughters fair; And these their daughters, ev'ry one, Had children twenty-four: Yet none of these fair daughters saw Another in the face; Their age exceeds not, I can shaw, 'Bove twenty-four hours space. Exp. The year having 12 months, every month 30 days, every day 24 hours; days signify the daughters not aged above twenty-four hours. XVIII. I am man's chief and only friend, And yet his greatest foe; I love him dearly to the end; To death with him I go. Exp. Conscience. XIX.

A POEM, shewing the Original, Antiquity, Beauty, and Glory of Masonry; also its Progress, Improvements, and Usefulness; with a Description of the Mason's Lodge. All which is concluded with an Ode, sung to the tune of, The free and accepted Mason. To which is prefixed, instead of a Preface, a Poem on the printed Pamphlet. 'Tis not, indeed, my talent to engage In lofty trifles; or to swell my page With wind and noise; but freely to impart, As to a friend, the secrets of my heart; And, in familiar speech, to let thee know How much I love thee, and how much I owe. Knock on my heart; for thou hast skill to find If it be solid, or be fill'd with wind; And, thro' the veil of words, thou view'st the naked mind. Dryden. Although my numbers be but faint and lame, I've ventur'd fairly to subscribe my name. Alex. Nicol, a free Brother. To all free and accepted Masons. Worshipful Brethren, Accept, kind Brothers, of my weak essay On that grand ancient art of Masonry: A secret kept since first the world began, And still unknown to the most searching man: Obtain'd by none save in a legal way; Nor will, while lasts alternate night and day. Pretending fools will find themselves mistaken, And all their confidence will soon be shaken: Their vain pretensions better far they'd smother Than be examin'd by a lawful Brother; Yet, uncontroul'd, they'll boast of mighty things, And seem as proud as emperors and kings. The Mason word, (says one), I know as plain As any Brother in the Mason's train; For I have seen the whole in open print, About which they so great a bustle vent. O, says the other, can the thing be true? For I of it had once a single view. True, says the first, ay 'tis the Mason-word, As sure and plain as any can afford. A certain Brother whom they disoblig'd, And treated badly, as it is alledg'd, He, in revenge, their secret open made, And to the world the same he published. As fools are wise still in their own conceit, So these pretenders think themselves complete. If I should say, That printed pamphlet's nought, It would not change their vain and foolish thought: But let them answer points of entrance, then I'll call them Brothers, and the best of men: But they may pore on pamphlets till they're blind, E'er they ought like true Masonry can find. My poem will prove a riddle to all those Pretenders, who nought of the secret knows: To them, if told, yea, e'en the lightest word, Would shrink their hearts, and turn their blood to curd. But all free Brothers, known in masonry, Will in the poem secret beauty see. Read and approve, or disapprove; all's one; We know what's What: pretenders, pick your bone. A POEM on Masonry. Ambition prompts my grov'ling muse t'aspire To touch the highest string in Nature's lyre; Tho' like Apollo's heedless son, I may, Grow giddy in my flight, and lose my way. May rural Muses poise my flutt'ring wing, While these few lines on Masonry I sing! If ought by me sam'd Masonry could raise, My pen would fondly celebrate its praise: I'd sing its glory in each age and place, And from its rise its ancient beauties trace; Since monuments, and bright records of fame, Illustrate to the world a Mason's Name. What matchless patrons honour Masonry, As sacred writ and hist'ry testify? To set aside the Builder of this All, Who is the first and great Original; Who gives all wisdom, and instructs mankind All useful arts and science out to find: Yet notwithstanding, and with reverence, we May say that he did honour Masonry More than all arts found by the human race, And long before invention first took place: Yea, the most High, the God of heaven and earth, Who spake, and all from nothing's womb came forth, Himself assum'd, and justly too may claim, The title of a Master Builder's name. He laid the earth's foundations on the sea, So firm and sure that mov'd it cannot be. He built the lofty rocks and mountains high, Under whose shades the beasts might shelter'd ly From scorching heat of PhÅbus sultry beams, The only storehouse of fresh water streams: He rais'd the arches of Ã¦therial sky, Under whose vaults the winged fowls might fly. Nine spacious spheres, wherein the planets move, The footstool of his glorious seat above, Which (as by sacred writ we're plainly told) He built of jasper and of purest gold. Thus Masonry's original took place, When all this world was nought but empty space. Next man was made lieutenant-lord of all, Productive of this great terrestrial ball; Endu'd with reason, and each faculty Resembling the most sacred Deity; Inspir'd with wisdom, able to invent Accommodations for his own content: He'd first endeavour, doubtless, to procure A shelter for's repose, to rest secure; A natural instinct, whereby brutes purchase (To cherish nature) a quiet resting place. But man more wise, especially that man Who gave his sons of every art the plan, Beyond all dispute he did houses build, Before the earth was either sown or til'd. But Adam's son, first-born of all mankind, Improv'd the art of Masonry, we find, A city built for trade and government, Wild anarchy and factions to prevent; Trade, government and civil laws, we see, Owe their beginning unto Masonry. The seventh from Adam, fam'd in Masonry, Secur'd the art to all posterity, By building pillars, which yet extant stand, As monuments wrought by his artful hand; One of prov'd brick, the other stone secure, That one might flames, the other floods endure; Whereon he wrote a certain prophecy: Thus writing is deriv'd from Masonry. When all the world corrupted was with sin, There was one faithful Mason found therein; Yea, when all flesh was by a flood destroy'd, He did find grace, and was by God employ'd To build an ark, to preach, and warning give, That so his brethren might repent and live. As sacred records plainly do express, He was a preacher of pure righteousness: Preaching, as well as other arts, we see, Took its first rise from ancient Masonry, All artists, with their various craft and cunning, Could not prevent or save themselves from drowning, Save him, and his own family; no moe, Exempted was from that dire overthrow: Thus Masonry, true Masonry, was found Still to exist, when all things else were drown'd. To satisfy the critic's curious eye, The sacred writ will plainly testify, That he a Mason's character and name Might fairly own, and as his honour claim: Not by the ark he built; for carpenters Might challenge that, that patronage was theirs; But soon as he set foot upon dry land, On Mason's art he first essays his hand, And built an altar, whereon, as a priest, He offer'd sacrifice of each clean beast; Whereat Jehovah smelt so sweet a savour, That made him promise to the world a Saviour; And as a sign he would no more destroy, Nor with a flood his creatures more annoy, He set his bow upon the clouds, to shew His gracious purpose stands for ever true. Thus miter'd heads that wear the sacred gown, Are not asham'd fam'd Masonry to own; Even Moses, meekest of the human race, This honourable art he did embrace; He hew'd and squar'd two tables fair of stone, And the decalogue God did write thereon. Mechanic arts, and lib'ral science, all From Masonry had their original; Tho' some, whose judgment groundless fancy sway, Say, it was founded first on geometry. The rule and square, chiefly the compass show, From Masonry all other arts must flow. The compass sure belongs to Masonry, And comprehends all in the world that be: It seems by compass all things first were made, And nature still is by a compass sway'd: So that, without all dispute, Masonry Of other arts has the pre-em'nency. After the deluge men began to spread, And study commerce, science, arts and trade; They, to secure that one of Masonry To after ages in its purity, They made a word, and nam'd it Secrecy. Thence handed down it was by a Memphian swain, By whom its derivations were made plain; He, as a faithful and accepted Mason, Taught a Tyrenian's son the sacred lesson; Who was the most accomplish'd in his art, And acted still a faithful Mason's part. To his companion of renowned fame, Worthy to bear a faithful Mason's name, He freely did communicate the same: Who, in his progress, on a time, by chance, Found one, who after wore the crown of France, And taught him all the myst'ry of that art, Which he acquir'd in every point and part: By him this art and myst'ry did revive, And with new glory in that kingdom live: From whence it was to England introduc'd, And made to flourish at the king's request; Who, by a royal charter and decree, Fix'd an assembly every year to be At York, where all accepted Brothers met, The rules of Masonry to regulate; By whose example and authority, Lodges were form'd and manag'd conjunctly. Hail, mighty art! whose wondrous glory shines, Outfacing time and proudest monarchs reigns: In every nation, structures of great fame The Mason's art and glory do proclaim: Witness the Memphian pyramids, which stand The world's wonders, pride of Egypt land: Diana's temple, the Ephesians trust, Fame's residence, all Asia's great boast. That richer building of Mausolus' tomb, And many structures both in Greece and Rome; And Babylon's prodigious walls may seem T'illustrate to the world a Mason's name. Besides, the temple at Jerusalem, The Jewish glory, and the pride of fame: Walls, bulwarks, forts and tow'rs of sure defence, Shew forth the Mason's great experience. What lofty arches over rivers stand, Securely fix'd by Mason's artful hand, Where all may walk safe as upon dry-land? Sailors in midst of Mason's art safe rides From hurricanes, and the tempestuous tides. All cities, castles, forts and churches stand, As monuments wrought by the Mason's hand. The mighty works, by Masons fram'd of old, In golden letters ever stand inroll'd. Kings, emperors, and princes have been proud, In every age to have themselves allow'd The name of Mason; and rejoiced more To wear that badge, than all they had before. The Masons Lodge. In yonder valley stands the mighty dome, Where Nature shines in all her gaudy bloom: Where riches, beauty, art and pow'r unite To make the structure of the lodge complete. Here golden steps preliminaries join'd With precious stones, the richest of each kind; The lofty gate, expanded high, decor'd With all the beauties Nature can afford. Here spacious lights let in the gleams of day Thro' azure vaults, that back rebound the ray: The floor rich pav'd from every costly mine; And round the walls carbuncles brightly shine. The painted roof in highest orbits rise, Bedeck'd with all the beauties of the skies, In various colours, arch'd of red and green, And fiery amber shine in trails between; And opposite is PhÅbus pourtray'd fair, With constellations round him as in air, The ground-work azure with indented clouds, Above the reach of deluges and floods. When time tires out, and can no longer run, Forth from the centre, brighter than the sun, Shall come the Master, who will justly judge All members of this great and spacious lodge. The ODE. I Here's a health to each one, From the king on the throne, To him that is meanest of station; If they can contend, To have lawfully gain'd The name of an accepted Mason. II Fame trumpets aloud, And seems to be proud Of such a grand occupation; To shew unto all, That there is none shall E'er vie with an accepted Mason. III The glory of kings Are poor empty things, Though empires they have in possession, If void of the fame, Of that noble name, Of a free and an accepted Mason. IV It is ancienter far Than other arts are, Surpassing each other profession: There's none can pretend To discover a friend Like a free and an accepted Mason. V The world is amaz'd, Their wonder is rais'd To see such concurring relation Among us: they cry, The devil is nigh, When one is accepted a Mason. VI But let them say on; To us 'tis well known What's true or false in the relation: Let's drink his health round, That is secret and sound, And a faithful accepted Mason. On receiving a Compliment from the Right Honourable the Lord Kinnaird. While sullen cares my sinking mind o'erflow, Yet in my breast warm emulations glow, Still pregnant with what I can ne'er express, To wit, the tribute of my thankfulness, Your Lordship's due: your bounty merits more Of grateful wishes than I have in store. My words, my wishes, and my earnest pray'r, Is what your Lordship evermore shall share. Could these ought add to your true happiness, The good of heav'n and earth you would possess; And, as a blessing, Heaven your life would lend A longer date, to be a poor man's friend: And when death call'd, your soul would mount above The starry orbs, to reign in bliss with Jove May these be yours; and you a patron shine In ev'ry thing that's noble and divine! May all the blessings of the poor await To introduce you at the heav'nly gate! There, in return of all your gen'rous deeds, Find happiness that human thought exceeds! And here your famous name around the plain, While time remains, still sweet and fresh remain! The poor shall weep when you're 'mong saints preferr'd: And say, oh, for another Charles Lord Kinnaird! My weak endeavours shall be still to show How I'm attach'd, what gratitude I owe For your high bounty: and my rural pen, In humble verse, shall shew I still remain, Your Lordship's most grateful, Most humble, and most Obedient servant, ALEX. NICOL. An ELEGY on auld Use and Wont The EPITAPH. Here lies auld honest Use and Wont, Which loss we never will surmount As lang as time remains; her death Will to all ranks be meikle skaith. Oh Scotland! Scotland! hae ye not, Though ye have stupidly forgot, Ye have avow'dly cut the throat Of Use and Wont; And brought upo' you sic a blot You'll ne'er surmount? Had Use and Wont been to the fore, As she lies buried in her gore, It had advantag'd Scotland o'er Nae little luck: But now, unless ye her restore, Ye're a' mere muck, I need nae say, 'tis o'er well kend, What Use and Wont was to her end; She was to church and state a friend While in her health; Frae father to the son descend She made our wealth. Now sin' auld Use and Wont's awa', The clergy, that should people shaw The gate to heaven, are wood wrang a', They're sae divided; Religion's toss'd like ony ba', And fair misguided. A race of kings have fill'd our throne, Twa thousand years and mair bygone, Descended a' hail sale frae one, Fergus the first; But now in Scotland we have none Sin' Wont's deceast. We had baith parliament and king In our ain land, and ilka thing That did fo'k good, and gar'd us sing Wi' merry mood; But now we a' may turn the spring Sin' Wont is dead. Our peers and gentry were content To bide at hame and spend their rent: But now to travel they are bent, Baith ane and a'; And crack their credit ere they stint, Sin' Wont's awa. Our landlords did nae grudge to see Their tenants thrive, grow rich, and free: But now, gin they win ae babee, Without remead, Their rent is rax'd to a degree, Sin' Wont is dead. Pride was nae in our land sae rife, Nor prejudice, envy, and strife, 'Mang nei'bours near, or man and wife; A' did their best To lead an honest moral life, Till Wont deceast. A farmer ween'd himself fu' bra', When he had plaiden hose like sna', A good gray hodden coat, and a Grey plaid aboon, Warm mittens on his hands, and twa Strong pointed shoon: But now ilk chiel that wins a fee, Maun hae bra' blues; and wha but he? Wi' buckles at's neck, feet, and knee, Well scour'd and clean, As new coach harness use to be; He looks nae mean. Our lairds and lords, yea e'en our king, For garb sought never ony thing But what our ain land forth did bring; Ladies, and a' For foreign fegrims did nae fling Their gou'd awa'. We sought nae foreign wines nor tea, Nor rum, nor brandy, o'er the sea; Good hailsome whisky ay took we To gust our gums; We car'd nae scantly ae babee For o'er-sea drams. While Wont winn'd here a living wife, Our gou'd and silder were as rife As coals are in the shire of Fife; But sin' she's dead, There's mony leads a silly life, Right scant o' bread. While Use and Wont winn'd in thir lands, We had nae use for bills nor bands; All bargains stood by shaking hands, Or prolling thumbs: But now, without them, naething stands; Bargains or sums. We had baith gou'd and silder mines, And poets too that cou'd mak' lines, And some as honest sound divines As ither nations; But now our land its beauty tines Wi' unca fashions. Our brousters made good nappie ale, And sald it cheaper a good deal, And ane then got far better sale, Than now some twa: But now the drinking trade maun fail, Sin' Wont's awa'. For taxes on our ale and maut, And on our tallow, hides, and saut; And mony wrangs, besides a' that, I'll no descrive: But Wont thae things wou'd regulate, Were she alive: Our ancient rights and liberties, And courts of our regalities, Our sheriffs, stewarts of a' degrees, Baith ane and a', Great men's superiorities, Wi' Wont's awa'. Our land is now skier naked made; Not ane auld gun, or rusty blade, Is left us now to save our head When danger comes; Our faes of us naething may dread, Except our bums. Our native garb aside is laid, The ancient tartan coat and plaid; Nane o' them a' dare now be had, Sin' Wont's awa'; Poor Scotland now maun a' be sway'd By English law. But Use and Wont, like mortals a' Must unto death a victim fa': I leard it had been ither twa; But what remead? That honest heart is e'en awa'; Alas, and dead! An ELEGY on Johnie Galla'. The Epitaph of Johnie Galla', A singular and antique fallow; Wrought without tyring, fed wi' pleasure, Despising honour, pomp, and treasure. Of all e'er wore a liv'ry coat, He was the mirror without spot. Though here he lyes in dust, yet he Shall live in this his elegie. Inhabitants of Rossie, now Doubtless your tears are not a few; John Galla' ye nae mair can view, Without remead: He's tane his last good night o' you, Alas! and died. He was a servant neat and tight, Baith leel, and trusty, and upright: His master's turn he cou'd nae slight; Nor was he sweer, Either by day or yet by night, This mony year. He kept the doors baith snug and clean, And a' things feat as a new prin: Baith ear' at morn, and late at e'en; He never tyr'd: His equal's scantly to be seen; Yet he's expir'd. His feet sae harness'd on the soles, That he could tread on burning coals: It set him well to smile at droles, And shake his head: Well cou'd he purge the scuter holes: But now he's dead. His doublet brisk fac'd up wi' red, And well cock'd hat upon his head; He by his mein might seem to lead The British force; His aspect look'd sae fierce and dread, On foot or horse. When he was mounted on a beast, Don Quixote was to him but jest: For ilka squire wou'd have embrac'd Him for a knight; If he had been in harness dress'd, And armour bright. Though he was fit for actions brave, He did nae lord it o'er the lave, Nor like ambitious fools behave; But wi' mair wit, In sober mood, with visage grave, Did ay submit. He took his lot just as it came, Nor fate nor fortune did he blame; Untouch'd by a revengefu' flame, Or jealousie: This character was ay his aim, Fair honestie. Like him at weddings wha cou'd dance, Sae nimbly in the ring advance? He gar'd his metal-buttons glance, Like fire and tow; And kiss'd the lasses as by chance They came in's row. Well cou'd he waught at ale or beer; And gar fouk swelter, laugh, and sneer, When he the lasses but came near, And mint'd to kiss: But now he wins nae langer here, Ah, and alas! Now, wha will manage his wheel-barrow, Sae fairly drive the plow and harrow? Malicious thoughts he did debar a', And vengefu' feud: Behind he has nae left his marrow; But now he's dead. The geese and swine will miss him sair, He gae them curns of pease and bear: Of out-things he took special care: And a' he said Was simple truth, and naething mair: But now he's dead. The church's odd debates he shun'd, And was nae at state factions stun'd: He laid nae stress on monie's fund; But e'en jogg'd on, Judging plain dealing surest ground To walk upon. Sure his religion was the best, Unstain'd wi' envy or contest: 'Mongst other things that he profest, He was intent To take his victuals, and his rest, Wi' free content. He made nae whining fair profession, To raise his pastor's expectation, That he was working for salvation, Like hypocrites: Against him never court nor session Gave out decreets. He was nae drunkard, nor a glutton; Yet he could taste good ale and mutton: The world he valued not a button, That is well kent: Nor had he change of suits to put on, Yet ay content. He was a subject in his station, Loyal as any in the nation, And well behav'd in his vocation, And was indeed The quite reverse of affectation: But now he's dead. He neither spent his time nor money In courting lasses, black or bonny; He never ca'd them Dear nor Honey, When in his prime: Good truth they were a' ane to Johnie At ony time. There's nane can ban his banes when rotten, For gear he had that was ill-gotten: He'd rather that he had been sodden, Hale in a kettle; Or in some desert lyen forgotten Under a nettle. He died in nae choleric pet, Nor was his stomach overset, Nor age nor labour made him fret: But death unseen Came sliding in when it was late, And clos'd his een. When on his tae side like a lamb, Death wi' a sweat, baith cauld and clam, Soon smoor'd out a' the rudy flame That life express'd; While in a grouffing easy dwame He slept to rest. Thus Johnie died withoutten pine; And was well row'd in linen fine. Ilk ane that kend him, cry'd, Oh whine, Poor Johnie's dead! Nane 'tween St Johnstoun and the Skrine, Can fill his stead. Right was he in a coffin laid, Like ane of qualitie array'd: In caps good ale and brandy gade, Just like dub-water; That gar'd the carlins crack that stay'd, And nonsense clatter. Nae little honour was conferr'd Upon him when he was interr'd: Nane o' the company deferr'd To see it sae; But when they came to the kirkyard, Ilk ane look'd wae: And as a sign he was respected, There was nae ane call'd, that neglected To come just at the time expected; Nor did they part 'Till they his grave-stane had erected, A' griev'd in heart. He buried was within the night, Wha hang out a' her torches bright: Wow! they shin'd dowie at the sight, And unco blae; For PhÅbus had withdrawn his light, He was sae wae. Then all, as men discreet and wise, Cry'd âPoor man, in his grave he lyes: âThough we should greet out of our eyes âThe brinish tear; âYet fate, alas! to us denies âHis presence mair. âSin' he sae honestly is laid âNow in his grave, it may be said, â'Tis nature's debt that maun be paid âWi's a' as well: âLet's try if we'll by Bacchus' aid âO'er grief prevail.â Then back they went to Rossie green, Where at the first they did conveen: They drank his dredgie late at e'en, Ilk ane cap out; Nae dool nor dolour mair was seen, But health about. An EPISTLE, from Mr D? L? Schoolmaster at Kinnaird, to Alexander Nicol Schoolmaster at Collace, February 3d 1749; on seeing my last book, called Nature without Art. Dear Sandy, when I saw thy book, And gat a grip o't i' my cluik, I read it o'er into the nook On ilka e'en; But in little langer than an ouk, I tir'd my een. Thou chief art of the poets a'; Thy verses they are unca bra,' And in them there is not a flaw. To be discern'd By eyes of mine; and I hae twa Wi' which I learn'd: And wi' e'm I'd be glad to see The man that penn'd the book for me; But ah, alas! where can he be, In what'na' place? Some tell me that his dwelling's nie, Up at Collace. Which tho' it binnae far awa', Alas! the gait I dinnae knaw, Nae farther up than Sunnie ha'; Then pardon me, Altho' I never came ava' To visit thee. This trash I'm sure when ye inspect, Its filthiness will make you yeck: But to the dult please, Sir, direct, To Kinnaird straight; Where he an answer will expect, Baith right and taight. In verse acrostic my name I thought to sen'; But waes me now, a hair is in my pen. This, with my compliments to you and your spouse, is from, Sir, Your humble and obedient servant, D? L?, A. B. Teacher of the school of Kinnaird. Alexander Nicol's Answer to the foregoing Epistle, February 6th 1749. Sir, The next day after Candlemas, I yours receiv'd in a Scots dress; A hantle war's gane to the press, As witness mine; On whilk ye'd little wit to stress Your twa good een. Anes in a day, when I was young, If ony chiel my praise had sung, I'd like a travel'd tailor flung, And been right vain; But now wi' eild, alas! I'm dung, And blunt's my pen. Whereas you say, You dinnae knaw Nae further up than Sunnie ha'; I think ye've a Scots tongue to ca' At towns and speer; And some good body wou'd you shaw The hie gait here. Besides, you say, Your verse is trash; To praise them here I sanna fash: But I's be whipped wi' a lash, Twice ilka day, If Allan Ramsay made nae cash O' war' nae they. Now, sin' my answer ye expect, I've ventur'd on't for manners sake. Excuse my muse, now auld and weak And rusty grown; Tho', to say truth, she in effect Was ne'er high flown: For latin, logic, greek, nor grammar, I dinna hae: and tho' I stammer, Against me ye need raise nae clamor, But e'en forbear; For my dull Muse would need a hammer To gar her steer. But yet I wou'dnae for a colt, Say, or hae't said, I were a dult: I'd lend my Muse a hearty scult, And gar her trot; Let right or wrang be the result, I'd valu't not. As custom is my compliment, I send to you tho' unacquaint; Wi' you I wou'd be well content To spend a gill, When I come shortly, after Lent, Down the Bought-hill. In verse acrostic ye intendit To write your name, and to me send it: May be I might had quite miskend it, And smoor'd your wit; Our correspondence then had endit. E're it took foot. Now take the hair out of your pen, And anes mair try the rhyming strain; For I right fickle was and fain, To be sae rous'd, By ane wha never did me ken, Sae seldom us'd. Your second essay I expect; For if I had it to inspect, It would revive my intellect, That's dull and heavy; And that wou'd gar me hae respect, For dainty Deavy, While Alex. Nicol. James Ratcliff's Retreat from the Prison of Edinburgh, Monday 23d of July 1739, he being to be hanged the Wednesday after: A SONG. I I as in bedlam, was confin'd A prisoner in chains; And unto death I was design'd, Had I not taken pains. I saw the hour of death approach Unto me very nigh: But now I'm free of that reproach; That cursed death I fly. II Farewell, prison-house, I now No more in you remain; Ye iron fetters all adieu, I think the day's my ain: Farewell ye magistrates, and all In fair Edina's town; I value not, nor never shall, Your judgment, sword or gown. III But be advis'd by me, I pray, Your prison better watch, Upon the next comes in your way, Since I have made dispatch. Since I'm out of your confines, I Rejoice and bless the night, Wherein I had the liberty To take my farewell flight. IV Tence now, ye sullen fears of death! I'm now beyond the pow'r Of that call'd justice; and my breath It cannot now devour. In mercy Heaven grants respite To some that's doom'd to die; The which with praises I'll requite, While I triumphing fly. V Grass-market is not now my dread, Nor yet the fatal tree: It surely is the place of blood, But so 'tis not to me. Let murderers and perjurers Have still it in their due; But let stout-hearted pilferers Their liberties pursue. VI I never did the poor oppress, But those that had to spare, I thought it no unrighteousness The same with them to share. But many landlords in the land Oppress with tyranny The poor; and yet they safer stand Than gen'rous knaves like me. VII Dalgliesh, that dog, no doubt would have His trade still going on; He thought to send me to my grave; For pity he has none. But now, I think, he's mumpt of me, And may go hang himself: I'll triumph o'er him and the tree, Had I some little pelf. VIII But now I have not time to stay To tell you all my mind; Lest I should by too much delay Your tyranny more find. Let magistrates and judges both With anger gnaw their nails: It is best-sailing, by my troth, When wind fills up the sails. A SAPPHIC ODE. I Fairest angel, sweetest creature, Loveliest dearest thing in nature; Tell me, tell me, why that heart, Which can fiercest flames impart, And those eyes so vastly bright, Flaming with excessive light, Neither vows nor pray'rs can move, Nor the pleasing joys of love. II Deep despair, and wasting sighs, Caus'd by your celestial eyes; Restless nights and pining grief, Yet no prospect of relief; Frightful dreams, distracting woes, And each pang a lover knows, Break my quiet, rack my breast, Chasing thence each milder guest. III Such a radiant form as thine, Sure the gods could ne'er design, Rude Tay's rumbling stream to grace; Or create so fair a face, 'Midst eternal snows and frost, To each social pleasure lost; Or e'er place so bright a star, In so low, so wild a sphere. IV No, another fate is due, Brightest seraphim, to you; All the rapt'rous joys that wait On the blessed nuptial state; Ev'ry pleasure that can move, Or incite the soul to love; Ev'ry gift the world can show, Or the heavenly pow'rs bestow. V So the fam'd Cyprian dame, Which now sets the world in flame, Lost 'midst shatter'd ruins lay, And had never bless'd the day, Till great The Venus of Medicis, found by Cosmo Duke of Tuscany. Cosmo's searching eye Did the latent marble spie; Ravish'd saw, with joyful eyes, The fair polish'd wonder rise. A SONG, Tune Allan Water. I As charming Phillis, all alone, Walk'd on the banks of Illa water; The fish up to the surface came, The birds on ev'ry tree did chatter: All join'd so in the harmony, As if it was by them concerted How to engage her to the place, Or how she should be there diverted. II So slowly flow'd the gentle stream, As if it meant she should discover, By its aversion to depart, How much it also was her lover. But when press'd on by the next wave, Which also made all haste to have her, It mourn'd and murmur'd all along, That it should be constrain'd to leave her. III Then Phoebus lifted up his head To see this much admired creature, He blush'd that she shou'd him exceed, And spread his rays o'er ev'ry feature; Thinking, that by his scorching heat He should have made those eyes to cover, That him of light and life defeat, And make each creature her fond lover. IV But whilst she thus did him attack, The nimble deer came out to meet her, And to their silent shades and groves, With all their art they do invite her. With armed heads, and winged heels, So cheerfully they trip'd before her; And when she stood, they stopp'd and gaz'd, As if they humbly would adore her. V By accident I passed by, While thus each creature she alarms; None was more captivate than I, Nor more engaged to her charms: I fix'd mine eyes on ev'ry part, And then I turn'd them up to heav'n, Wishing the gods may send relief, To cure the wound that she had giv'n. A POEM on R? H? of South-Ballo. Let valiant heroes glory o'er the dead, And in triumph their conquer'd captives lead; Let bribes in courts the covetous allure, And misers hoard in bags their cash secure; Let lawyers lead their clients to expence, And wrangling clergy dispute for the sense; Proud haughty beaux expose their foolishness, Oppressors all within their pow'r distress; Lovers for gold instead of beauty pant; And debauchees drink, whore, and swear, and rant; Improvers, architects, and foreign scums, From landlords wheedle many needless sums; Let poets write strange hyperboles of praise On silly wretches, worthy of no lays, Or write heroic numbers on the wars, Intending to describe European jars: But me, let me, in low plebeian verse, The works and merits of a friend rehearse, And were it in my small engine to raise Bright and heroic strains in Ballo's praise, I would not grudge either my pains or time, To furnish out the most delightful rhyme. The Fates concurr'd with Nature, both exert Their skill in forming of a man expert, Complete in body, more complete in mind, Surpassing many of the human kind: For who could trace him from his birth and cradle, Till he became a man to mount a saddle, Might see his embryo fancies quickly grow, Unto a pregnance, yea, an overflow. Thus Jove's own brain one time so pregnant grew, That to get ease the god himself not knew; Till Vulcan came, and daring with his hammer, Gave him a blow that made his godship stammer; And cleanly cleft his ripen'd brain in two, Whence out in haste the armed Pallas flew. Just so, when time had Ballo's fruitful thought To perfect rectitude and ripeness brought, A thousand schemes, each justling to get vent, Oppress'd his brain, all pleading his consent. Some bid him travel: others, arts pursue: Some to the court his politics to shew: Some bid him try the martial feats of war; For there, there only same and honours are: Men seek by these for an immortal name, That after-ages may their deeds proclaim. But he, delib'rate, saw the ills that might Upon such vain aspiring mortals light: The trav'ller often in his journey dies; And fame oft from the proudest warrior flies; Artists find small encouragement oft-times; Courtiers detect'd for some inglorious crimes. Thus he survey'd the scenes of life; and bless'd The country life, as judging it the best. Thought he, What's honour or wide-mouth'd renown, The dignity and glory of a crown, Guarded by foes, at best but seeming friends, Pretending such for base sinistrous ends? While I contented and securely sleep, Needing no centinels my life to keep: Good angels guard my chamber all the night, And early cock proclaims approaching light: Up with the sun, I and my rural train, Each to their labours, some to plow the plain, Some thresh the corn, others do dung prepare, Plying each season of the wheeling year. What life more sweet, enjoying more content, Than when the farmer views his meadows, pent With various flow'rs, which ev'ry now and then Nod with sweet zephyrs puffling o'er the plain? Nor need I be less famous, if I please, Than potentates, e'en kings, and great grandees. Thus after chusing of a farmer's life, Bless'd with a virtuous and a loving wife, His fruitful thought with ease began to play Upon his buildings seeming to decay: The muddy walls he tumbled down, and threw Them into dunghills, straightway building new. But to describe the schemes and plans he laid, The thousandth part by me cannot be said; Improvements, buildings, plantings, these declare What mighty feats by him performed were. ACROSTIC. Revere ye Muses, and exalt the name Of a bright patriot; and let the same Be grav'd on brass and marble, that it may Endure till time thro' waste of reign decay. Review his worth, his works and management, The curious buildings with their ornament; How beautiful the lofty summits rise Upon firm bases, and invade the skies; New culture shews a landskip fruitful fair; The barren heaths and rugged mountains bear Elms, ash and fir, and hedges young enclose Rich fertile plains, where corn in plenty grows. Old men shall say, in time to come, that these Fair buildings, and these stately rows of trees, Set were and builded by a farmer's hand, Of curious thought, whose name should fairly stand Within Fame's temple, wrote in purest gold, Till latest ages wond'ring hear it told. His vast performance here not only shines, But mighty floods shall bear them to the Indes; A thousand things he curiously hath wrought, Lay open to the world his fruitful thought; Lavishly Nature her rich gifts bestow'd On him, till they in ev'ry part o'erflow'd. A Remark on the Poverty of Poets. If poverty that virtue had That it all poets perfect made, I would be one as good as any; For often I have not a penny; Yea more sublime drown'd o'er the head With debt, and pinching want of bread: If these be the unerring muse, I have the bays none can refuse. The Complaint of a Lark directed to a great Lion: A Fable; occasioned by another Lion being influenced by some evil Speaker, to suspect the honesty of the Lark. Sir, I'm oblig'd, in bitterness Of soul, to utter my distress, Not unto you, but to all those That know me, whether friends or foes. Let my complaint with echoes sound, With doleful notes to all around, That all, whoever heard my name, May judge how far I am to blame. I'm blam'd, tho' guiltless, for a crime I know no more of, than the time When I'm to die: and oh! 'tis hard To be from my best friend debar'd By scandalous reports, the which My very heart and vitals touch. All birds and beasts, yea, and the best, Their friendship unto me express'd, And gave me good encouragement If I did either sing or chant: But now I'm ruin'd, and my name Must sink with dire reproach and shame. Because my friend, like PhÅbus fair, Doth influence each other star, Who in conjunction will unite To make my misery complete. But my once worthy friend I'll not E'er brand with such a nasty blot, As for to say, or think, that he Would take a prejudice at me: Except some devil's imp of hell, In wickedness that must excel, To him had represented me In such a scandalous degree. Therefore this one thing shall I say, As Jove's to judge the world one day, The wretch that scandal'd me at first, Escapes fair, if he's not accurs'd. 'Tis true to my experience I never knew such exigence As the last winter all my life, Having five young ones and a wife, But little income easy spent, Yet never seem'd I discontent; For if the sun did warmly blink, Up in the air then would I clink, And there chirp o'er a song of praise To Jove in hopes of better days. Tho' many time, as I'm a sinner, I left my little homely dinner To distribute among the rest, And made diversion all my feast, And slept for supper; seldom more I eat but once in twenty four: Yet none without my nest e'er knew Whether my tripes were toom or fow. Had it not been my gentle heart, I had not acted such a part, If I had to my friend reveal'd What I industriously conceal'd: For certain he some oars had laid Some support for me to have made; For many time, when unexpected, Something for me he has collected; Reliev'd me when in many strait. But now, how wretched is my fate! My name is torn, my friends are lost; Now what remeed? despair I must. Oh vengeance, vengeance, Heav'n take Upon the wretch that first did make My friend my honour to suspect, And me with prejudice neglect! When I think on the defamation Of my good name, a perturbation And agony sets all my soul In fever like a burning coal: It galls me to the heart to think That e'er my character should shrink; For tho' I am of low extraction, I ever had the satisfaction, So far back as tradition traces, Or man remember can the faces Of my progenitors, was not In all our characters a blot. Tho' I'm a poor and simple lark, Yet all that know me can remark, I love my honour and good name, As the proud hero does his fame; And all my intimate acquaintance Will as soon trust that lofty mountains Can be thrown down into the sea, As there's dishonesty in me. Besides, the crime I'm charg'd with may Be seen, as clear as light by day, To be as false an accusation As e'er was heard of in the nation: For my good friend had in his house A tame she-fox, that did abuse Him by imbezzlements; 'tis said That I with her connivance had. But none of all the feather'd kind Was ever with false foxes join'd, Especially the lark, a bird That none offends by deed or word. Our rules of life are innocent, Not justly suff'ring detriment: For in the morning when we rise We soar aloft among the skies; There chearfully we sing Jove's praise, With warbling notes and easy lays; We've gratitude, and pure good will Towards our benefactors still; We know no flatt'ry, fraud or guile, Our fellow-creatures to beguile: Ambition fires our little souls, That lifts our thoughts above the poles; So that we scorn that dirty way That mankind call dishonesty. Tho' I, of all the choir, myself Am but a senseless silly elf; Yet I defy all living creatures, Tho' of the most malignant natures, To prove in justice black's my eye Relating to fair honesty. I love my friends and benefactors, And I forgive all my detracters; Disdaining, as below me far, Envy at any one to bear: For ne'er a forest bird or beast More gen'rous spirits e'er possess'd. Perhaps by this I may offend Him who was once my worthy friend: But let him think in sober mood, If wronged innocence be rude To clear itself, when so put to it, What blockhead is he would not do it? I would not for broad Britain's rent Defame a creature innocent, Tho't were below my rank as far As my old friend's superior. 'Tis murder, in the worst degree, Thus to defame a creature free: For me I'd rather choose to die, Than to survive my honesty. But the event I must refer To mighty Jove, who cannot err, Who governs all sublun'ry things, And turns the hearts of mighty kings; Therefore his mercy I'll implore, Who can my innocence restore, And will against that wretch declare Dire vengeance, horror and despair, That causeth my disquietude: But my complaint I must conclude. The MORAL. Some are so bad they will not stand E'en the most innocent to brand; And when themselves are guilty found, Their neighbours they will also wound; And all men credits that report That tends towards their neighbour's hurt. The Cat and the Ape. A Fable. A child, on a time as he sat at his dinner, By an ape and a cat was attack'd in this manner: These animals both fast to him approach'd, And first on the elbow him gently touch'd, To curry his favour, but chiefly to gain Some part of his dinner their lives to sustain. Both us'd their endeavours to gain the child's heart, And make him with some of his victuals to part. Puss simply purring as her natural song, Stroak'd his hand with her head, while her tail swept along His mouth and his nose: which when he had done A small bit he gave her, and bade her begone. The ape, hunger-bitten, was mov'd with envy 'Gainst puss, whom he seemingly lov'd formerly: He thought it high time both to speak and to act, If he ought of the child's dinner should make. âThat base ill-bred badrons (then said the false ape) Attacks my dear child in too rustic a shape: She can teach you nothing that you stand in need, Except it be rubbing your hand with her head. Be ruled by me, my dear child, if you can, I'll teach you to mimic the deeds of a man; I'll teach you to climb, to leap and to scratch, And fifty fine things in a moment dispatch.â Ambition puffs up the poor child to believe; Not doubting or dreaming that he did deceive; He gave him his dinner: but when he was strute, At the child's disappointment did both laugh and flout; And told him his kyte was so cram'd with his victual, At present he could not well show him his mettle; You'll wait till I'm clunger; but take care of that, Regard not the rubbings of badrons the cat. The MORAL. True honest simplicity never can gain Such profits from mankind as flatt'ry obtain. On seeing Smith and Craig's bantering Poems, anent the building of a School-house at Glenshie. Long time I sought, at last did see, Smith's poems he made in Glenshie, Anent the building a school-house, And fondly them I did peruse. I found a whig call'd Jasper Craig, Who with the lairds had made a league To banter Smith out of his right, And so with paper-balls they fight. But Craig the Presbyterian clerk, He has made very smutty wark; For his expressions, so profane, A Puritan's profession stain. But the Episcopal's more modest, And plainly tells him he's the oddest For filthy words as one can hear; They would offend a strumpet's ear. Indeed the Black-Smith, as he names him, With ridicule and banter shames him; And proves him but a poetaster, Although he be a Craig of Jasper; And teaches him in poetry, Where capitals should used be. Shame to be thus reprov'd and taught By one whom he had reckon'd naught. But o'er the craigs and Highland hills, Smith skips triumphing o'er their quills. In satire no man dares come near him, In Lyric strains they all admire him: His panegyrics are so just, That ev'ry reader praise them must: And for an answer to a letter, None of them all could give a better: For ready wit and easy verse, Craig like to Smith could ne'er rehearse: So that for modesty and wit, The Whig to Tory must submit. Yet they had been both poets good, Had not their subjects been so rude: But true it is, for all their biting, There never came fair words in flyting. An EPISTLE to Mr Robert Smith Schoolmaster at Kinnaird, upon his saying he would not stay in the Place. Kirk of Collace, April 30th, 1750. SIR, If you were not over nice, I'd humbly offer my advice, And it is shortly this; Stay at Kinnaird, for I do think You want not company and drink, And all things at your wish. Upon a bank, afore the sun Your house is situate; A purling stream that round it run, Commodious I wat: With respect to prospect, You have the Carse all o'er, By Tay-side, where ay tide Flows twice in twenty-four. You live hard by the orchard wall, Where mellow fruit unshaken fall, Just at your very feet; An able house well thatch'd aboon, A garden near to rest at noon: What should move you to flit? Flocks feeding on the mountains round, Where lambs do skip and play; The feather'd kinds their music sound To waken up the day: You view then the plowmen All whistling pleasantlie; There's nae thing, but ae thing, You want to happy be; And that's a wife, as I suppose, That puts an end to lovers woes, And calms the tide of life; Which if you had, I dare well say, You would not mint to go away; Look out then for a wife: And settle with your state content, And tempt not Providence: If you remove, you may repent, Void both of peace and pence: Neglect then, t'affect then, Pride and inconstancie; Engage in religion, If you would happy be. Your youth-hood makes you fickle yet, And makes you your affections set On vanity and gain: But be advis'd to mortify Your youthfu' laits by piety; Ambitious to obtain Eternal happiness at last, When this frail body dies; For pleasures here will soon be past; All are but vanities. Be plain then, remain then Still in that hearty place; Discerning youth's learning, And your own growth in grace. Your father's counsel keep in mind; Let not thy brain be stuff'd with wind, To drive you here and there; Like empty clouds that soar aloft, With ev'ry tempest tossed oft With violence through the air. Consider, that a rolling stone Contracts but little fog; There is a dub at ev'ry town, At some a sinking bog: Look out, then, about then, And seek a pious maid, Both homely and comely; Then will your mind be stay'd. This, with my hearty compliment, I with the bearer have you sent, That you may think upon it. But yet 'tis scantly worth your pains; 'Tis the extract of wither'd brains, A poor imperfect sonnet; But you may trust 'tis from my heart Whate'er I wish or say: With you I have no will to part, Therefore I wish your stay. Admit, Sir, my wit, Sir, Was never very meikle; What then? I remain ay Your servant SANDY NICOL. Mr Smith's ANSWER. Sir, Your letter I receiv'd of late: But wow! it was lang after date, Nae less than se'enteen days: But when it came, I it perus'd, And with attention thereon mus'd, And ponder'd ev'ry phrase; But yet I still am at a loss An answer how to send, Since to my muse 'tis sick a cross To pen six lines on end; She haults ay, with faults ay, And canna' get 'em mended; Ay skipping and hipping The words I most intended. So that I cannot be so kind, As freely tell you all my mind, In this my rustic strain. But only for good manners' sake, I've sent you here for to inspect The product of my brain: The which, no doubt, when you peruse, You will not much admire; But if you would lend me your muse, My genius to inspire, I then, Sir, would pen, Sir, An answer that were better: But fulness of dulness My senses all do fetter. Whereas, in yours, you counsel me, In flitting not too rash to be, But even to stay still In this sweet place, as ye describe it, Where all things are for me provided According to my will: But will with me's of more extent Than ever I'll attain; For which cause I must rest content And think here to remain, Ay grudging, and drudging At my poor slavish trade, Designing declining't, If better might be had. You say, a wife's the only thing That I want here to make me sing, And live most happily; Which if it be, I'll look about, And see if I can find ane out, That will be fit with me In sacred wedlock for to join, And give to me her heart; Then I'll be her's, and she'll be mine, Ay until death us part. If she then, shall be then According to my mind, I'll bless her, and kiss her, And still to her be kind. My resolutions now you've got; But whether they be right or not, I can't tell for my life: But be's they will, if I be spar'd But a short while into Kinnaird, I'll look out for a wife; Which if my fancy happen right, And she do not despise me, I will them bless, both day and night, Who did at first advise me. Excuse now, my muse now, She has not meikle pith, To write this, nor dite this, Nor yet hath Robert Smith. POSTSCRIPT. If you think fit to take your pen, And write me something back again, I kindly will accept the same, With a' my pith, And so your servant I remain, While Robert Smith. Another EPISTLE to Mr Robert Smith. February 23d, 1751. SIR, I see you haslins do incline, That I should dig into the mine Of my poetic brain: But ah! 'tis a' sae overgrown, And heaps of rubbish tumbled down, By time's extensive reign; That perfect mettle to find out Would be an unca tawing, 'Twould surely cost me many rout, Great threaping and hard thrawing, While heching, and peching, Because I hae nae pith, To get, Sir, a bit, Sir, To send to Robert Smith. You see by this I'm out o' breath: But, may be, you'll say, That's nae skaith, By spending breath I live. Sae is the fate of folk that's auld; For young folk's clever, stout and bauld, And will nae mainings give; Therefore hae wi' ye o'er the hill, Altho' it be wi' toil, I'll do my best to shaw good will, If't were but for a mile. Ken auld dogs are bauld dogs; They bite sair when they bite: I'll try, then, if I then Something to you can write. I set my fancy on a tow'r, And bade it round about it glowr, Some subject to spie out, That might be fit to send to you: At last and lang ane came in view; I caught it by the snout, And drest it in my liv'ry syne, And bade it come to you: E'en take it, tho' it be not fine, Tho' better be your due. Uneasie to please ye, I would do ony thing; But musty and rusty I am, and cannot sing. But I'd say, I'm surpris'd to see Sae many fools of ilk degree Among the human race: For, when I look the warld around, I cannot see a man that's sound, And wise in ev'ry case. For viewing man when he's a child, He can but girn and greet; Or when a youth, he's very wild, And often indiscreet; Or when, Sir, a man, Sir, He seldom is content With what, Sir, good fate, Sir, Has freely to him lent. If he shall have a little more Than what his father had before, It puffs him up with pride: For set a beggar on horseback, The very first course he will tak, He'll to the devil ride; For beggars they can bear no wealth, Nor rich to want submit; And sickness frets the man of health; For few or none have wit, To spie out, and try out, The vanity of things, Whilk double the trouble On silly mortals brings. The worldling he torments himself With anxious cares to gather pelf, Perhaps for fremit heirs. Th'ambitious cuts his way thro' all Difficulties that may befal, Thro' seen and unseen snares, Aspiring to more high degrees Of honour and renown: Nor bloody wars, nor raging seas Can cast his courage down; Disdaining remaining In any certain place; Till he ay shall see ay The upshot of the case. The man of pleasure takes his ease; And, all his appetites to please, He spares no charge nor cost: Ne'er minding he account must make; Such is his folly and mistake, He gratifies each lust. Thus ev'ry mortal shews his folly In less or more degree: Some overjoy'd, some melancholly; Some o'ers in all we see; Exposing, supposing Their folly to be wise; While others, e'en brothers, Such wisdom will despise. For my part I can easy spy A mote into my neighbour's eye, While in my own's a beam; Yet strength of logic never can Convince me, that I am the man For folly that's to blame. As fools are wise in their conceit, E'en so is all mankind; As when we reason make submit To passions of the mind; 'Tis common, that few men Can their follies spy; Too late they regrete, ay, When 'tis past remedy. I have no time here to enlarge Upon the follies that I charge Against the human race: But as I said, I cannot spy, In no where that I cast mine eye One wise in ev'ry case: For youths they want experience, Their wisdom is to learn: And men use little diligence True wisdom to discern: The aged's engaged With great infirmity: No leisure for pleasure, Nor wisdom, they can see. The rich and poor, the high and low, Respectively their follies show, So that no man is wise. The rich and great are proud and vain, They look on poor men with disdain, And them in heart despise. The poor, again's not innocent, For they're fill'd with envy; They with their state are discontent, And fret continually: Ay grudging, and drudging, To gain their daily bread; All wholly in folly Are plung'd quite o'er the head. Yea, the religious and divines True solid wisdom undermines, Their follies glaring be; For when opinions they espouse, They tie themselves thereto by vows, And strong, strong bigotry: But some, for love of worldly gain, Would make shipwreck of all; As they for ever should remain Upon this earthly ball; Ne'er dreading, nor heeding. How life-days slide away, And death shall their breathes all Cut, and in dust them lay. Farewell, my friend: and if your Muse Had but free scope, which ye refuse, I would get something more. But by this stanza I'm confin'd; My Muse is also out of wind, And trachl'd very sore; Therefore upon another pitch, Where freedom we may find To write what we incline to touch, And freely tell our mind. Adieu, then, to you then; My Muse is tir'd and bruckle: Yet duty to you, too, Obliges Sany Nicol. The PETITION of Alexander Nicol. Schoolmaster at Collace, to the Honourable Sir William Nairn of Dunsinnan Baronet. Honourable Sir, 'Tis kend to many far and near, Th'improvements I have made while here On yard and biggings baith: And for my land, I'm very sure, By the one half 'tis not sae poor; Yet 'tis not free of skaith: For neighbours that ly round about it, Have par'd it sait awa'; It is sae little that I doubt it, That 'tis not right at a': If ye then, to me then, Would tell what should be o't, Wi' pleasure, I'd measure't, And see if 'tis right or not. But the main thing I mostly want, Is what, Sir, you can easy grant, And I'm no right without it; That's summer-pasture for my cow, The whilk, Sir, if I get frae you, I'll pay't, you need not doubt it. Near by me, Sir, you know you have Some rigs to others set; Some part thereof is what I crave, For payment I may get: 'Twould please me, and ease me Of much difficulty: Sir, grant it, I want it, And beg it earnestly. As for my house, 'tis shame to see't, And I am almost herried wi't, 'Tis war than a sheep-cot: The windows give but little light, Without a broad to shut at night, To keep rough weather out; The roof's sae bad, when rain dings on, It draps through ev'ry place; And for the space of six years gone, Sir, this has been my case: I find then, the wind then, And rain dings out my light; Believe me, it grieves me, I'm aft a weary wight. And I maun tell you what I think, Though I had a' the meat and drink You hae about Kirkhill, And had nae other lodging-place, Except the school-house of Collace, It would be mis'ry still: But your allowance, Sir, I doubt, Has gone some other way; What you bestow'd to make it out Has been to knaves a prey; And those men you chose, then, To see the work well done, Made slight things for right things, And yet the price all one. It is dependents' comfort sure, When landlords do for them procure Things necessary right: And honours also doth accrue To kind superiors as due, And puts all grudge to flight. I witness can and testify, How gen'rously you did Things of like nature rectify, Where you concernment had; And I can't deny but That I was satisfied; Which made me, to speed me, Here in you to confide. By these among whom I have been, I'm bragg'd when they my house have seen; They tell me to my face, We thought Sir William would have giv'n You something like a little heav'n To live in at Collace: We see your house is ten times worse, Than what it was before; 'Tis neither fit for cow nor horse, Butt window, roof, or door. But I then, reply them, Sir William knows it not, Else he unto me would Some better things allot. But if I had things neighbour-like, I with a kind of airy fyke, Would brag them ane and a'; And on the matter look right vain, And briskly show them but and ben, My house just like an ha', My yard, my barn, and my byre, And little glebe of land, And summer-pasture, though for hyre, All under your own hand: I'd then, Sir, maintain, Sir, Your generosity, No dominie that common be, In better case than me. My poor petition now you see: And if you please to grant it me, I would be well content; If not, I'll seek some other place, Though loth to leave you and Collace, Sae lang as life's me lent: For many years experience, Your friendship I can boast; And yet in you have confidence, The same will not be lost. If you, then, would bow then, And grant me my request; The favour would ever Make me to wish you blest. ALEX. NICOL. An EPITAPH on Alexander Robertson of Struan. Poor Struan's eyes are clos'd, he lies Now in Death's darksome shade; His chearful voice and mirthful joys Are all in silence laid: In this he err'd, that he preferr'd The man he hated most, To be his heir, and took not care, Till his estate was lost. He in his life had not a wife Among the human race; But the nine lasses of Parnassus By turns he did embrace. No children did from him proceed Of the terrestrial kind: But thousands stand in well-rang'd bands, The produce of his mind; These will show forth his fame and worth, Through ages to ensue; No time can waste, nor envy blast A character so true. What he desir'd, he ne'er acquir'd; And that was once to see Each ancient Lord to's own restor'd, And James supreme to be: But all may know, that here below, None can be satisfied; For all men wish some certain bliss, That is by Heav'n denied. But now his shade is from us fled, And join'd the seraphs bless'd; There to complete the numbers sweet, That here he oft express'd. Let Scotsmen all, both great and small, Lament the death of Struan, And ev'ry thing that seems to bring About their country's ruin. An ACROSTICK. Push'd on by virtue, and industrious care, As all men are in something singular, The Fates agreed to favour each design Remarkably that he did e'er incline. In him the proverb's good to a great pitch, Chiefly the hand that's diligent makes rich: Keenly, by day, he and his servants wrought, His sleep by night was banish'd oft by thought; Unweariedly each day he did pursue New schemes and projects that he had in view, Till he made purchase of a good estate, Each year still adding till it was more great: Reverse of pride and churlishness, yet he Observ'd the rules of mod'rate decencie. Fortune smil'd on him with a full broad face, Kindly caress'd him to his grave in peace. No common man e'er such a figure made, Admir'd by all; now his immortal shade Pursues his active course where it is fled. To the Memory of the Honourable George Hay of Leys, Esq Gone then, great Hay! and shall my rustic Muse A tribute to his memory refuse? O Death, thy pow'r extensive is too far; Thy sword devours in peace, as well as war: Strange! that a tyrant should for ever reign! All good and bad subjected to thy chain! The brave and great, that mankind could defy, Must in a moment, at thy pleasure die! The peaceful, grave, and sober mortal must, By thy austerity, be turn'd to dust! Leys' brave ancestors stood the direful shock At Loncarty, there thund'ring with the yoke Regain'd the vict'ry, when it was near lost, By turning back the fainting flying host; Chear'd royal Malcolm's soul, who saw the day Again restor'd by the undaunted Hay: Yet these by thee, O cruel death, are slain; But, spite of thee, their progeny remain. Thou hast devour'd great Errol's house, 'tis true: But yet the Hays thou never couldst subdue; Kinnoul yet stands in honour and renown; Antiquity thou never canst pull down. Leys peaceful, grave, and sober; yet thy dart Found out a path to pierce his honest heart, And cut him down: but as the phÅnix dies, Another from her ashes doth arise; So Leys, though dead, a progeny succeeds, To represent their great ancestors' deeds. What can we say? Sure there is not a soul That can the pow'r of conqu'ring death controul: All we can do, is to lament and grieve That cruel death ev'n lets not good men live. Leys, not less famous in a peaceful reign, Than his progenitors in a campaign. If he'd been call'd, his valour had been shown, And made the Hero and the Patriot one: But, as he liv'd in such a peaceful age, More useful studies did his mind engage. He seeing farmers at such cost and toil, For little produce by a barren soil; He taught them how to cultivate the same, And thereby purchas'd honour, wealth, and fame. Whereas Carse-farmers in the days of yore, The more they toil'd, the less they had in store: But now their wealth encreaseth with less pain; Their barns enlarg'd cannot contain their grain: All this is owing to the Laird of Leys, By his example and his counsel wise. But now no more he treads the fertile plain, T'inspect the labours of the rustic swain, Directing how fields should be till'd and sown, Or when and how the meadows should be mown: No more he calls the swains and maids at morn To rise, and reap his fruitful fields of corn: No more he orders how to sort each grain, And tell what should to ev'ry rick pertain: No more he sits with a devout decorum, To judge as justice of the peace in quorum. Doubtless his consort, with a grieved mind, Laments an husband dutiful and kind: Doubtless his children mournfully deplore A prudent father, that he is no more: No doubt his friends the sable garments wear, And on reflection often drop a tear. The church and state may mourn, since, to their cost, They both in him a faithful member lost: In him all men a good example saw, Of frugal life, religion, and of law: He made the wicked of their deeds asham'd, And dread him, if they only heard him nam'd. But so it is, that mortals all must die, Some in their bloom, some in their infancy; And some arrive at such old age, that they Like to a lamp, for want of oil, decay: Thus Leys expir'd in good old age; and ev'n Belov'd of all, of God, and ta'en to heav'n: There the reward of virtue he enjoys, An endless bliss that neither fades nor cloys. On Captain Balnave's being dangerously sick of a Fever at the time he should have been married; inscribed to his Lady afterwards. Hail, welcome here, Largotion fair, To be the mother of an heir; An helper meet, and social friend To him that has your favour gain'd: But thanks to Cupid, for his craft, That at the white so aim'd his shaft, So that the whizzing arrow flew Unerring in its path to you; Insensibly the feather'd dart Pierc'd thro' your young and tender heart, And caus'd an easy restless pain, That made you night and day complain; Yet not in words, but in your thought, 'Till providence Alexis brought. But Cupid he had cunningly Took up his lodging in your eye, And at first sight he unawares With's arrow pierc'd the son of Mars. Then honest Hymen standing by Resolv'd to fix the nuptial ty, To ease you both of future pain, That you no longer might complain. But all the nymphs, with envy cry'd, When your felicity they spy'd, We've lost Alexis, certainly; Let's smite him now that he may die, That so our sister-nymph, as well As we, the smart of loss may feel. When Mars beheld such insolence, Such vi'lence to pure innocence, He straightway to Apollo ran; Said, Brother, come and see this man; The Naiades and the wood-nymphs hath Destroy'd him almost unto death: Our sons on earth their skill have lost; Come cure him up, whate'er it cost: Then shall libations offered be To Hymen, and to you, and me: The lovely pair will us invoke, And make our sacred altars smoke. Then soon Apollo did apply For him a present remedy, And cur'd him up; the happy swain Was perfectly reliev'd of pain. Then golden Hymen brought his robe, At which your virgin-heart did throb With vigorous and gay desire, That Hymen's torch doth still inspire. Then he your hands and heart did join, Both bowing to the sacred shrine. Enjoy now as much happiness As I can wish, or you possess. Thus, Madam, here my tale I end, Not wishing it would you offend: May be indeed I've said o'er meikle, Yet no ill's meant by Sandy Nicol. On the City of DUNDEE. Near where the Tay joins with the ocean wide, Dundee's fair harbour stands on its north side, Where ships of burden safely can repose, While billows rise, and loudest tempest blows. The ancient city, fam'd for arms and arts, Parent of many that have shown their parts, Nothing inferior to the world abroad; Such to this city is the gift of God. Dundee is peopled with a prudent race Of wealthy traders, that enrich the place; To strangers kind, and hospitably good, With manly virtues almost all endu'd. Where ancient buildings were by time defac'd, More spacious new ones in their rooms are plac'd: An ancient steeple rears its head on high, O'erlooks the town, and penetrates the sky; Strangers admire, when it afar they spy. A new town-house, much like a palace fair; None of its kind can with it once compare: Their care and prudence did of old provide An hospital for those that are decay'd; Two ancient churches, decently decor'd With all utensils necessar well stor'd. Accommodations they have many now, Which their ancestors ne'er so much as knew: The water-works that turneth as they please To quench with speed the flames devouring bleeze; Lamps in the streets that give a splendid light, Whereby we walk safe in the darkest night; An ancient spring, whose streams long useless stray'd, In leaden conduits now are all convey'd From street to street, the cities multitude By them's supplied with water fresh and good. But ancient things commodious and great, Buildings and wealth, these ne'er secure the state. Where's Babel, Troy, and fam'd Jerusalem? There's scarce a vestige to be found of them; For pride and lust, and wretch'd idolatry, Bloodshed and rapine, and proud tyranny, Long since have made them in oblivion ly. But, lo! Dundee's fam'd citizens have been, Thro' ages past, for virtuous actions keen: Their fervent zeal for pure religion shin'd, And left the rest of Scotland far behind, And with the work of reformation join'd. Here virgin beauties, with such lustre shine, That ev'ry charm about them seems divine: Here virtuous matrons, chastly fix'd in love, That to their husbands helps and comforts prove: Here men of learning, honour and renown, In ev'ry age, have grac'd this ancient town: Hail, ancient city! citizens, all hail! May ne'er your grandeur, wealth and honours fail! Thy trade still prosper both by sea and land! What-e'er you wish be still at your command! Let your religion flourish still in thee, Thy greatest glory since thou wast Dundee! The BROKEN LAIRD REPAIR'D; OR, The DYVOUR turn'd a THRIVER: A COMICAL TALE, IN FIVE CANTOS. Happy the man, who, studying Nature's laws, Thro' known effects can trace the secret cause; His mind possessing in a quiet state, Fearless of fortune, and resign'd to fate. Dryden. Persons in the Poem. An old Gentleman and his Lady. Waste-all, their child. Laborious, their child. Miss Jenny, their child. Caution, tenant to the gentleman. Auld use-and-wont, wife to Caution.

You that in stories take delight To pass the tedious winter night, Lend your attention here a-while, The sequel it will make you smile: Pass by its faults with negligence, And think the author wanted sense; And look not on it as a crime, What's usher'd in for sake of rhyme; None can pretend all men to please: But here it comes just as it is. There was a gentleman of late, Who had an opulent estate, A virtuous lady, chaste and fair, That did three children to him bear: Two sons; as usual, the first-born Was heir; the second had a turn For husbandry and rural life, But chanc'd to wed a tippling wife. The heir was Waste-all nam'd; and he Was justly nam'd so, as you'll see: Laborious was the second's name, Whose wife Miss Tipple must needs claim: The daughter, youngest of the three, Was beauty's perfect symmetrie. No byass'd misconstructed blame Could ever stain Miss Jenny's name. Her careful pious mother taught her All duties that became a daughter; And she as willing to obey, Receiv'd her precepts ev'ry day; Till she arriv'd in the complex The perfect mirror of her sex: She could be chamber-maid and spinner, And on a pinch could dress a dinner: Thus, country-like, she did acquire To manage both at barn and bire; Yet could behave in her vocation By the best born in the nation; Of her, her father comfort had; Her mother on her death-bed said, âYour parents, Jean, you ne'er despis'd; Therefore by me be now advis'd, Ay learn to work, go where you will; Can do, my dear, does seldom ill. And for this reason we all know All things are fickle here below: Before you end your precious life, You may become a farmer's wife; Yea fortune may, if she's not kind, Cause you to wed a lab'ring hind: An idle life's unsafe and sinful, But diligence is often gainful; Pray for a blessing from above; Submit to the good will of Jove; Be ay content in poverty, Grateful as in prosperity: And when I'm sleeping in the dust, You'll find my counsel good, I trust.â Now mark what must not be forgot, This worthy gentleman of note Had an old tenant in his ground, Whose counsel was ay safe and sound: His name was Caution; and had long Liv'd in the place: he was not young; For I'm inform'd he was not under Twelve years, of being ag'd two hunder. It passes for a true relation, That he's the oldest in the nation: Some say Auld-wont his wife, was more, Before she wed him, than six-score. Be that as 'twill, I'm very sure, They were no churls, nor were they poor: They lov'd it well to see folk thrive: They many children kept alive, With bits and sops about their table: As for the poor, that were not able To work, they never went away Without sufficient alms one day. But some with grudging eyes beheld His prosp'rous state, with envy fill'd, Thus to insult the honest man, In public companies began: âThere's Caution, tax-man of Burnhaugh, Inclos'd with weeds of arns and saugh; Securely sits both warm and dry, Nothing oppress'd with poverty; Yet he deals more unto the poor, Than all the increase of our store: And as an oracle of fame, All fools admire his very name; Yea, our good laird, though he be wise, With wiser Caution must advise, Concerning his rash son and heir, That rambles wasting here and there; Yet both their wits can ne'er contrive A mean to make that young man thrive.â Thus, when he heard their taunts about, His patience was so much worn out, That, like a clock run near the hour, He did assume the speaking power. âMy friends, (said he), what though I be A tax-man? doubtless so are ye; Each of you in as good possession, Though not content with your condition: And what though I sit dry and warm? Can that to you do any harm? Use means, with frugal honesty, And then you'll sit as snug as I. 'Tis true, and must needs be confess'd, With poverty I'm not oppress'd; But that's the blessing of kind Heav'n, That to me such good luck has giv'n. As for my giving to the poor, More than the increase of your store, I, by experience, see 'tis plain, The more I give, the more I gain. Ay since I held my tenement, Each year thereof I paid my rent, And had enough to give and take; Which freely, for the Sender's sake, I frankly dealt unto the poor, That call'd for pity at my door: Oft have I prov'd that true record, Who gives the poor lends to the Lord; But now there's few within the land Will trust a farthing in his hand. But some think neither sin nor shame, To play some guineas at a game; Or at horse-races wagers lay, Which shall be foremost, black or bay: And some to hunting are so glu'd, And love so much the sport renew'd; That they, to purchase dogs and hounds, Will forfeit honour, wealth, and grounds. Some love to gratifie their eyes With new-form'd plans and rarities Of building, planting: and there be That study schemes of husbandrie, Improving grounds to such a pitch, Intending thereby to make rich; Some venture on the mighty main, Some unknown treasure to obtain: Some face the awful scenes of war, To gain the trophies of a scar; Ambitious madness men pursue, But there's but few, a very few, That walk in any ways conform To Heaven's laws, or them perform: Few when they're blest with wealth in store, Deign to take pity on the poor. But Heaven's Judge, that judgeth right, Seeing such wretches, in his sight, Consume his lib'ral gifts to feed Their lusts, while his poor people need To be supplied; then will not he On such at last avenged be? Yea, we may daily see and hear, That those in honour who shin'd clear, The only top-props of the place, Are turn'd to ruin and disgrace: By the effects, I guess the cause Has been their breach of Heaven's laws. For those in the superior rank, Do ruin inferiors point blank: And equals, one another would Devour with pleasure, if they could: For pride, intemp'rance, and oppression, Abound so much in all the nation; Landlords oppress'd by government, Make them again rax out their rent, Their tenants to oppress; and they Cause their sub-tenants to obey, And serve with rigour at command, Like Israelites in Egypt-land: Like them they over-burden'd cry To Heav'n against their tyranny. Jove, who is an impartial Judge, He hears the poor, he's their refuge; And their oppressors will annoy; And with just judgment them destroy. Witness the late rebellion, which Swept off oppressors poor and rich; And if those that are left behind Be to inferiors so unkind, Just judgment sure will find them out, And that ere long, I make no doubt.â Then spake Laborious in a rage, âMen have been plagu'd in ev'ry age, With you, and scoundrels such as you, Who 'bout nonsense make such a-do: Such senseless tattling fools imagine, That we know nothing of religion, Because we don't observe the motions Of their poor whining vulgar notions. Your scoundrel kind, Sir, and the poor, Are nations' plagues, I'm very sure; For they're inclin'd to idleness, Under pretences of distress; And you, as senseless, them supply, Under pretence of piety, Such feigned hospitality Is an inlet to villainy, And gives encouragement to such, As on the public would encroach, Like drones that in the hive abide, And eat what frugal bees provide,â Then Caution said, âMy friends, allow That I but once more speak to you: I only give what God gives me, To those that are in poverty; And by experience I perceive, The more I give, the more I have: While you, with all your frugal cunning, Through various schemes and arts are running, Contriving how you may oppress The poor, and put them in distress; And to maintain your pride and lust, To ev'ry man you are unjust; To brutes, and to the earth itself, Intending to increase your pelf. You think it good and lawful thrift, The King and government to shift Of their just tributary rent, On cov'tousness you are so bent. Your equals daily you envy, Because they're not in poverty; And if you can, by slight or might, You will deprive them of their right. As for inferiors, do you not As much as if you'd cut their throat? You daily in a study dive How to cut off their means to thrive, How to impair their privileges; And with superior awe, obliges Them rig'rously to serve, while you Frown on them with contracted brow; Coarse victuals, and not half you give, Of what they were wont to receive. As touching beasts, you over-drive them, And often of their food deprive them; Were't not their price you fear to lose, Daily to death you would them toss: Thus brutes feel your oppressing hand, And grant to answer your command. To earth unjust, like atheists, you Manure, and dig, and dung, and plow; Intending maugre Jove to have More increase than you can receive. There's scarce a bit of ancient swaird, Which our forefathers ever spar'd For common pasture to the poor, But you must tear up and manure. Such things as these you may approve; But curs'd is he land-marks remove: And, notwithstanding all the ways You take to gain, your stock decays; As witness ev'ry month we hear; Yea, daily from the gazetteer; Your fair estates expos'd to sale, To keep your bodies out of jail. By what is said, I don't intend, The least among you to offend: But truth is truth, think what you will; I say no more; my friends, farewel.â The end of the first Canto. CANTO II. When to the antipodes the sun, With expeditious haste, had run, And left our horizon to borrow Light by reflection till to-morrow; The lab'ring hinds from toil retire, To rest and tattle by the fire, And with the lasses interween Their rustic sangs and jests between; While burghers and rich farmers chuse In taverns to tipple and carouse. Our gentleman of whom we spake, Another better course did take: Rather than tipple at ale or wine, He'd meditate on things divine; How happy man was at the first, And by what means he was accurs'd; What mischiefs mankind had invented, Since Eve their happiness prevented; How mankind, worse than tygers, would Devour each other if they could, And for greed of this vain world's good, Would shed each other's precious blood; Like savage brutes of the male kind, When they a lustful female find, The strongest would destroy the rest, To share alone the brutal feast. While other gentlemen were plotting, How oppression might get footing, He, like a grave and sound divine, To rules his conduct did confine: From morning till it was near ten, He gave himself to thinking; then From that time, till it was near two, His public matters did pursue: From two to six the fields he walk'd, And oft with honest Caution talk'd: Then, chagrin humours to suppress, He with his wife would play at chess; And all the pledges that they laid, Were easy won, and easy paid, A bottle of good ale or beer, With which the winner made good cheer; A cheaper purchase drowth to quench, Than rich Canary wines or punch. But, as good men oft evil see Before it come, e'en so did he: He saw his son, with sad reflection, So prodigal set on distraction, That made him think 'twould be his fate To waste and ruin his estate, That he had scrap'd and kept together, Like a discreet and prudent father. Then to his virtuous spouse he said, âMy dear, when we in dust are laid, That worthless wretched son of ours So high above our income tow'rs, He'll shortly make, for ought I think, Our name and honour both extinct.â Said she, âGood husband, there's no hope; He must get leave to take his scope. E'en let him drink as he is brewing; He'll think on't when he comes to ruin. Our frail and tott'ring bodies must Within a little turn to dust; Let worldly pomp and honours go, Since Providence will have it so; It will not break our hearts when we The desolation shall not see.â Thus were the ancient pair resign'd, Because they could not change the mind Of their untoward rakish son, Who out of course so far had run. Then the wise lady sent for Caution, And told him that she had a motion How to relieve her graceless son, When he his outmost course had run: But, âHonest friend, I know you must, By course of nature, turn to dust: You have a servant, as I hear, Whose name is Secret, bring him here; I will commit to him a letter, Containing all the secret matter; I'll take his oath that he'll conceal it, And to no mortal e'er reveal it, Until he see his extreme need, Then may he break the same and read. Then Secret came, to whom she gave The letter seal'd, and bade him have A special care to keep it close, And unto none the same expose, Until the time my son you see In extreme need and misery. âMadam, (said he), I shall obey Whate'er your Ladyship shall say, As I shall answer at the last To heaven's Judge for what is past.â Now Death approach'd the ancient pair; They died, and left their rambling heir, Who quickly wasted his estate, And so involv'd himself in debt, That night nor day he could not rest, Pursu'd with captions, and oppress'd To such a desperate degree, He knew not how nor where to flee: Two creditors, nam'd Trust and Outly, Chas'd and assaulted him so stoutly, That made him to appoint a day, To give his whole estate away. But, in the time of that respite, He thought to put on them a bite; And bargain'd with one Burgher, who Inclin'd he should outwit them: so Having agreed, he gave him all, His rights and titles, great and small; And so to make a full conclusion, He gave him a sole disposition. But, wicked chance! just in the nick, As Burgher counted out his tick, Trust and Outly came in view, And forthwith to the table drew. âBetter (said they) to be a guest At ending of a plenteous feast, Than the beginning of a fray, As we have been by chance this day.â Then said rich Burgher, âAll is one To me, however way 'tis gone, Th'estate is mine,âlet Waste-all now His nearest and best course pursue.â Then Waste-all said, âGood Sirs be kind; Since you to ruin me design'd, You've got my 'state, now let me have My bonds return'd, is all I crave.â Said Trust and Outly courteously, âThat, Sir, is what we should deny, Because we are not yet paid out: But we will get no more we doubt; Therefore we frankly here return them, And if you please, Sir, you may burn them: Besides, to shew a disposition Generous to your low condition, So far your credit to enlarge, We grant an ample free discharge.â Then Waste-all said, âI must conclued, Your proffers are both kind and good: But nothing now can me avail; I'm fit for nothing but a jail; Nay, not for that, but rather live As an abandon'd fugitive, Be the reproach of all mankind, Unstable both in place and mind.â Then Jenny said, all bath'd in tears, âLong since, alas! these were my fears, If you were e'er involv'd in care, You would be driven to despair. To reason sure it is contrary: Dear brother, join the military; Though there you serve in lowest station, You are a man of education; Behave yourself, and you will be Advanc'd to a more high degree. Howe'er, you ought to be content; 'Tis your past pride's just punishment. Why should a living man complain? Wealth may depart and come again: For my part, I'm content to serve In meanest station, e'er I starve; Let's make the best o't that we can: I'll play the woman, you the man. Good Caution was our father's friend, And counsellor unto the end; Apply to him; he'll not despise you, Tho' you are poor, but will advise you: He's not so partial, to respect The rich and great, and poor neglect.â Then Waste-all said, âMy sister dear, I to your counsel shall give ear.â To Caution's house they went full wo, Where was Laborious come, also His wife, and Burgher, Trust and Outly, All came to hear poor Waste-all's outcry, Who tore his hair and clothes so fine, And cry'd, âI've forfeit all for wine, For wantonness and frolic game, For which I now must live in shame. My pious parents I despis'd, Was by lewd company entic'd, While there was ought into my pocket: But by all these I now am mocked.â Some said, he's mad; some said, he'll mend: Among them he had scarce a friend: Some bade to get for him a whore, And some bade kick him to the door: Some bade give him a glass of wine; Some bade him come, sit down and dine. Ne'er was a man more far forlorn, Sustaining so much loss and scorn. Poor miserable prodigal, I'll leave him that he may bewail His own misfortune and miscarriage, And treat of fair Miss Jenny's marriage. The end of the second Canto. CANTO III. It seems there are but very few Themselves from Cupid can rescue: For he's suppos'd to shoot at random; And sometimes hits by chance the grandame, As well's the grandchild; all is one: His arrows force resist can none, Save eunuchs only; yea, a nun The pow'r of love she cannot shun; Nay, grief herself in vain must strive The force of Cupid to deprive; As witness here Miss Jenny fair, Dejected with dishevel'd hair. Young Secret sees a thousand charms Inviting him into her arms; Like to the sun, when he is shrouded, When by a summer show'r o'erclouded; His rays obliquely may encline, Yet will they with great lustre shine; So beauteous charms more sweet appears, When they're bedew'd with tender tears. Now Secret was a man reserv'd, And honest Caution long had serv'd; Yet must he feel the wounding dart Of Cupid piercing to his heart, That made him sigh and wry his brow, And think, âWhat shall I say or do? Can I attempt, in my low station, A maid of birth and education? Yet she's reduc'd, as well as me, To an inferior degree. I'll speak my mind, be as it will; Perhaps with her I may prevail: A proverb I have heard declare, A faint heart wins no lady fair; Wherefore I'll try my art to gain her, For never would a lover fainer.â So by degrees the lover drew To have a private interview. At last he found her all alone, Fetching many a sigh and groan; But like a lover he drew near, Possess'd at once with hope and fear: At last his courage won the day, And to love's passion he gave way. Said heâ ââDear Mistress, why in tears? Pray, cast aside your useless fears; Learn with all ills to be content, You can't foresee nor yet prevent. You gave your brother good advice, Take part thereof, if you are wise; Submit to fate, slight worldly honour, And never grudge at heaven's Donor. And if you please to condescend Your future life with me to spend, Perhaps you may be happy more Than what you ever was before: For tho' I'd been a lord or earl And you but a poor country girl, I could have lov'd none else but you, Tho' I'd sought all the world thro'. It is presumption to be sure, For me to think I should procure Your love, that you might live with me, Who am but poor of low degree: Yet I must needs my passion vent, Which doth my breast so much torment; If you disdain to pity me. No pleasure more on earth I'll see. Yet let me tell you, tho' I'm now In equal circumstance with you, Indeed I was as highly born; Therefore torment me not with scorn: For Jove of mortals doth dispose (For reasons that himself best knows) According as he hath a-mind, The consequence we only find.â Miss Jenny fetch'd a sigh, and said, âDear Sir, respect for you I had Before you spake; but much more now, Believing what you say is true. But, tell me, Sir, e'er I consent, How you resolve our settlement; What business you mean to drive, By which we may both live and thrive.â âYou need not fear, my dear, (said he) Each year I wan a certain fee, Most part whereof I have in store, And Providence will send us more: And my good master Caution will I'm sure befriend us ever still; From him we'll get a little house, Till fortune more for us produce: Therefore, my dear, give your consent, And learn with me to be content.â Said she, âIt seems 'tis fate's decree That you and I should wedded be: And since that I am brought so low, Great thanks I to my mother owe, That taught me how to work, and gain My daily bread, life to maintain. But, Sir, your birth you seem'd to hint Was unto me no detriment: Please tell me out the story clear; For fondly I the same would hear.â âAh! lovely fair, (said he) my birth To me is now but little worth! Which is the cause I have conceal'd it, And in this place yet ne'er reveal'd it: Yet I'll do ought at your command; Therefore, my fairest, understand, My father was an honest man, Descended of a noble clan; My mother also nothing less; But on that I need lay no stress: His name was Honest, and had not In all his character a blot; But to say truth, the country round With him was scarcely ever sound, Because his principles were quite Reverse to what was their delight. The good of others still he, sought, And ever spake just as he thought: He lov'd his sov'reign and his nation, And hated bribery and oppression: Laws and religion he supported, And the disconsolate comforted: E'en to be short, his life and fame Agreed exactly with his name. But in defence of lawful right, As he upon a time did fight, They took away his precious life; With grief thereat soon died his wife: I and my brother then were left, Of comfort and all good bereft: My brother older was than me, And frolicsome to that degree, That soon he wasted pack and purse, And died soon after with remorse; For gaming, balling, whoring, drinking, He never had time left for thinking, Till he, (ah poor unhappy wretch!), Of both our fortunes made dispatch; Which an untimely end brought on him, And few or, none was to bemoan him: I, griev'd at such a dismal case, Did wander from my native place, Not knowing where, with tardy motion; At last I fell on honest Caution; With whom I hir'd, and wrought ay since, None knowing of my circumstance. But now, methinks, kind Heaven smiles, And all my future fears beguiles; My sunken sp'rit revives again, Like to clear shining after rain; I'll frankly bear all ills of life, Since I'll enjoy thee for my wife.â âWhat you advance (said she) appears The greatest wonder in mine ears, I ever heard:âtwo never met So equally unfortunate. Let us to Heav'n ourselves resign; The will of Jove shall ay be mine: If Jove we love, serve, and obey, He will support us every way; And what he sees we really need, Doubtless by him will be supplied, But towards Caution's house let's go, There's my poor brother full of woe.â âBut stay, dear Jenny, I have now Thought on somewhat I have to shew To your dear brother, now in tears, That may prevent his future fears: Go therefore, bring him here to me; The sequel you shall after see.â âGlad would I be, if any were Could mitigate my brother's care. But are you bound so to conceal it, That unto me you can't reveal it? By ties of love, Sir, I would crave I might the welcome secret have.â Said he, âDear Jenny, rest content; 'Tis partly to get his consent, That you and I should wedded be; What's more, soon after you shall see.â Then unto him in haste she went; And said, âDear brother, be content, Go speak with Secret; lo! he waits For you just now without the gates: I'll in, and hear yon gentles talk, While you and he shall take a walk.â When she went in, Auld-use-and-wont Did give her knee a hearty dunt; And cry'd, âMiss Jenny, sit by me, There's nane mair welcomer can be.â Laborious took her in his arms, And cry'd, âShe has a thousand charms; Great pity 'twere one should be lost, That can of wit and beauty boast.â Then Burgher said, âGood Sir, 'tis true, And may prevented be by you; For you are rich enough, and can E'en help the girl to get a man.â âWell jested, Burgher, on my word: If you give ought, I'll give a third Above you, were it thousands more Than what she could have had before.â âWell then, (said Burgher), at this rate, Although my wealth's not very great, To manage you, I'll compliment Miss Jenny with a whole year's rent Of the estate I lately bought, Or as much cash, I'll 'minish nought; And to make good, Sir, what I said, My obligation shall be had.â Then Tipple said, âReach me the cap, I'll drink to Mistress Jane's good hap; For beauty, wit, and honesty, Procure good fortune certainly.â âNa, na, (said Wont), I winna say That Fortune favours good folk ay; For aft the best do suffer need, When warst are satisfied wi' bread. I've seen a proud insulting knave, With some few bags of cash, behave As he had been a Lord himself; So proud some are puff'd up with pelf: While wit and virtue have been made Oblig'd to beg their daily bread.â Said Tipple, âLet her health go round; I'm glad she has such favour found; And wish her more and more success, Till she exceed in happiness.â âCome, come, (said Burgher), sign, Laborious; This deed of ours must be notorious; An hundred pounds I give and grant, To ease Miss Jenny of her want; And you shall give her two, no less, According as you did profess.â Laborious said, âI will be glad, Since you for her such tidings had: So here we both shall sign the band, And give it freely in her hand.â The end of the third Canto. CANTO IV. Here view young Secret and his Lady Pregnant with news, to speak both ready: But he, more quick, first silence broke, And unto this effect he spoke; âA letter I just now receiv'd, At which I am both glad and griev'd: Since here we have a little leisure, My dear, I'll read it for your pleasure.â To Mr Symon Secret, residing with Mr Caution in Burnhaugh, &amp;c. âMy dearest nephew;? ?Understand, So soon as this comes to your hand; Come here to me, for I am lying Most dang'rous ill, for certain dying: My children all are dead and gone, And I am only left alone; And I bequeathe, as heirship due, My whole estate and wealth to you; Come take possession.âIf you're spar'd, See my corpse decently interr'd. My feeble fingers scarce will sign My name to this imperfect line: Your loving uncle till I die I shall remain,â âPhilanthropy.â April 2d, 1753. âMy dear, these are sad news, (said she), Since you must alter your degree, I'll now be left to mourn my fate, Nothing my grief can now abate: In my low state you seem'd to prove A comfort once to me, my love; But now from me you must depart, And leave me here to break my heart.â Said he, âMy dear, pray cease to mourn: To you I shortly shall return; Then you and me shall never part, Till death shall break our tender heart: And, to confirm what here I say, We'll marry e'er I go away: Yet fain I would my uncle see, If that I could before he die: But freely could I part with all, That mankind dear or valu'd call, And that with the profoundest ease, Before I you in ought displease; For still I'll love and honour thee, Since you have stoop'd to favour me.â Miss Jenny, smiling through her tears, Began to drop her former fears; Said, âMy dear Secret, Heaven smiles, And all my grief and fear beguiles: Can I then chuse but grateful be To Jove, for all his care of me? Yea, while I being have, I'll praise Him, who from nothing did me raise, And by his care and providence, Provided for me ever since. My portion was entirely lost, And I had nought whereof to boast, Save that I could work with my hands, To satisfy Nature's demands: But when my brother saw me mourn, His heart did with compassion burn; And said he would assign for me A portion fitting my degree: Burgher alledging that he would Not give so much as well he could, So rais'd his pride and emulation, That made him speak forth in a passion, âPray, Burgher, what needs all this trouble? âWhate'er you give I'll give a double.â Said Burgher, âThere's no tie on me, âBut Nature's self obliges thee; âShe neither is my kin nor blood: âBut, seeing she's both fair and good, âI'll give her wholly, out of hand, âA year's rent of her father's land; âAnd this the more engages me, âTo get sufficient mends of thee.â So they both sign'd the evidence, More out of pride than good pretence. Lo! here it is: I wish my brother, Poor Waste all, had just such another; I'm sure he would take better tent, Than he has done, how it were spent.â Then Secret said, âSome lucky chance His broken fortune may advance: But Laborious must not know, What there's pass'd last betwixt us two; For, since a portion he assigns you, You marry must as he designs you. But Waste-all is well satisfied, That you just now shall be my bride; And he is gone to call Miss John, To join our hands, and make us one: My master and my mistress, both, To tell the secret, will be loth; They shall be witnesses; and, when Time will allow, let others ken. To-morrow, by the break of day, If health permit, I must away: But do not grudge, my dear, nor mourn; For very soon I will return.â Then Secret went, the rest to warn To meet him just now in the barn: With that Miss John and Waste-all came, That put Miss Jenny in a flame. But, gath'ring courage, in they went; Both signified they were content: So joining hands, Miss John them bless'd, Declar'd them married, them dismiss'd. Then, coming to the company, One cry'd, âMiss Jenny, sit by me: Welcome, Miss John; here take your place, You're come in time to say the grace; For Caution is so staunch a Whig, And with the clergy turn'd so big, That men in company cannot Make free with him without a blot.â Said Tipple, âThat is very true; For if we're merry we're call'd fu': The like of him, if they were able, Would make an honest man a rebel: They prize their own fantastic wit, Because the ball is at their foot: This is a critical sad time, When ev'ry thing is judg'd a crime That's not conform to whiggish whims, A pack of saucy d?ls limbs.â Miss John replied, âDear Madam, stop, You should have better sense I hope, Than ridicule against the laws, Religion, and the good old cause.â âThe good old cause, alas! (said she), Is lost, for any thing I see. Our nation's constitutions all Are chang'd, and no memorial Of ancient privileges left; Fram church and state all are bereft. But, Sir, I'll not expect of you My meaning you will misconstrue: I love the government and laws, I also love the good old cause; I love religion when 'tis right, And all conform to holy writ; But impositions on folks conscience Are both ridiculous and nonsense.â Miss John then whisp'ring, said to Caution, â'Tis the drap drink that rais'd this motion: Pray, Madam, drop this topic now; For I suppose you please but few.â âContent (said Tipple), I don't doubt; For few love truth tell'd here about.â The end of the fourth Canto. CANTO V. The western hills eclips'd the sun, When his diurnal course was run; Night spread her mantle o'er the fields, And men resorted to their beilds; So here in Caution's house was met A company at table set: For he a supper had prepar'd, To comfort his young broken laird: But by their wits all were not able To make him sit down at the table; For no doubt but he looked blate When he had spent his whole estate. Laborious call'd him, âgraceless brother As ever was born of a mother.â Trust and Outly said, âno man Will do ought better than he can; Poor man! his case is right forlorn, He gets now baith the skaith and scorn.â Miss John said, âIt is Jove's donation That makes men manage with discretion.â Then Caution said, âDear Sir, I pray Be pleas'd the company obey; Sit down to supper: and take heart; For wealth will come and will depart; And if it leave not us, we must Leave it e'er long, and turn to dust.â Auld-wont said, âI have seen some men Toil and turmoil with meikle pain; Yet all fatigue they could endure, They could not help their being poor: And I have seen some men grow rich, That were intended to be such; And men of honour, wealth and pow'r, That thought themselves in pomp-secure, Brought to contempt, reproach and scorn, And in the saddest case forlorn. So that none needs to be cast down, When fortune, after smiles, doth frown; For she is but a ticklish jade, And those that heed her freaks are mad.â Miss Jenny said, âHis management, No doubt, his mind will now torment: Yet he's in better case this way, Than many gentlemen this day: Who, skulking, dare not once come near Unto their dwelling-house for fear; And many of them stain and catch'd, And soon disgracefully dispatch'd; Their goods confiscate, and their lands Are forfeit all in the king's hands: Their generation's banish'd from Their nation and their native home: Whose fates much sadder are by far Than those of my poor brother's are! For tho' his lands be lost, yet he May sojourn in the nation free, And use what occupation may By providence come in his way.â Then Burgher smil'd; and, jesting, said, âIf Waste-all well-lin'd pockets had, He'd sojourn with a better grace, Than he can do in any place.â Then Tipple said, âSir Burgher, you No doubt in this have spoken true; But yet I think your manners scant, To brag a poor man with his want.â âMadam (said he) be not offended, For it is more than I intended.â âI think (said she) you needed not Cast on his father's son a blot; A better fellow than yourself (For all your base ill-gotten pelf) Would not have brag'd him at this rate, For all your opulent estate: For, poor man, his necessity Was your curs'd opportunity; Just like a covetous meal-monger, That knows the poor must starve with hunger, Unless they give what price he pleases: Sir, by these means your wealth increases.â Said Burgher, âIt is women's failing, They always love to fall a-railing: Howe'er, your ladyship to fire, I'll drive the jest a little higher; Let Waste-all, if he pleases now, Before the company and you, Lay half my money in my hand, I'll wholly give him back his land.â Then Waste-all said, âSir, here I hold Your money shall to you be told; I have it in my pocket here, That will the bargain fully clear.â Then all the company amaz'd, On one another mutely gaz'd. Miss John said, âSuch another turn I never saw since I was born: Now, Burgher, you are fairly bit By him you judg'd had little wit.â Then said Auld-wont, âI think this day Might be the subject of a play; For better sport I never saw, Since ever I came here awa: It pleases me my master's son Will yet (poor man!) enjoy his own; I wish ilk ane could sing and say, My ain's my ain, as he this day.â Then Burgher said, âThat's come in season; I take you witness, she spake treason. âNay, hold! (said Caution) that's envy, And in revenge you make a lye; For, tho' she wish'd ilk ane their ain, Is that a treasonable stain? âYes, yes (said Burgher) the pretender Thinks Britain should to him surrender, And set him king upon the throne, Because he reckons it his own.â Then said Auld-wont, âSir, you, and others That in strange cruelty are brothers; You think no sin to cast aspersions Upon well-meaning honest persons: I had no thought of king nor queen, And wonder what such catchers mean: If ye were rightly serv'd, 'twere reason You were convicted, Sir, of treason; For when you say, the crown's his own, What wants he more, Sir, but the throne?â Laborious said, âI never dive Who should be king, if I can thrive; For kings and great men ne'er cast out About the mean and vulgar rout: So, when the king and government Promotes our int'rest, I'm content. I would not join, to change by force This government, perhaps, for worse: I think it is the height of nonsense, When we have liberty of conscience, Freedom of trade, and ev'ry thing Can be expected of a king, To wish a change, for one who may, Perhaps, oppress us ev'ry way.â âTo me (said Caution) it appears This bygone time, for many years, Our clergy and our gentry, they, For the most part have gone astray: Cursing, whoring, gaming, drinking, Was most the gentry's way of thinking; And living at too high a rate, By which they wasted their estate: Oppression, pride and tyranny, Covetousness and luxury, Brought divine judgment on their heads, To punish these their sinful deeds. The careless clergy seldom mind, Except on Sundays, things divine; Their stipends, glebes and gardens, they In their mind bear the greatest sway.â Then said Miss John, âYou are not blate To scandalize us at this rate,â âI speak in gen'rals, Sir, (said Caution) Therefore do not mistake my notion; For I'll say truth, you may expect it, Where one is serious ten neglect it: Let him to whom this charge is laid, Come challenge me for what I said; And then I'll know him to be one At whom I meant to cast a stone; Not knowing whom I hit until He tell me that I have done ill.â Miss Tipple said, âLet quarrels pass: I'm dry; let's have the other glass. Now Use-and-wont is an old wife; Let's have a hist'ry of her life: Say, why is she call'd Use-and-wont? Or was she nam'd so from the font? âThat be my task, (Miss Jenny said): Long since, when she was but a maid, Her name was Custom, as is plain, Attested by all honest men. Long since, in our ancestors time, When Use-and-wont was in her prime, She was like to a statute book, On which the nation all did look: And every one was deem'd a fool, That acted ought beyond the rule: Then was no need for bills nor bands; All bargains stood by shaking hands: Then was no tacks on tenements; Each paid their ancient usual rents: None would adventure for his neck His neighbour's tenement to take: None entries paid for their possessions, And none complained of oppressions. And if they had, as neighbours will, By virtue of the other gill, Or sitting long beside the barrel, About some trifle bred a quarrel, And rais'd the topic to such height As made them rise, perhaps, and fight; And may be, with their rackless blows, Broke others heads, or bled their nose: Yet of Auld-wont they stood such awe, That they durst never go to law; But the next day, when sober men, They took a pint, and 'gree'd again. Besides, the lawyers did not plead For love of gain, or for their bread: Justice and equity was all By which a cause could stand or fall: Yea, ev'ry thing within the nation Was done with justice and discretion. But foreigners did us corrupt, And our own customs we gave up, And brought us fashions from abroad, That to us at the first seem'd odd; Yet we embrac'd them at the last, And Use and wont away we cast. Some were so mad for her confusion, That they consulted a physician, How they a ling'ring potion might Give her, to wear her from their sight: So when she was quite out of vogue, And hunted sore thro' moor and bog, As an exile she here remains; And Caution thought her worth his pains To chuse her for his wife, and they Liv'd ever happy to this day: And Use-and-wont has been her name Ay since an exile she became; Ay since the poor have miss'd her sore, And many yet will miss her more. But shortly there will come a time, When they'll confess it was a crime: For lo! the curse that shall attend The wretches that did thus offend, Will eat their substance out to nothing, And leave them neither food nor clothing; No landlord e'er shall thrive a day, That helps to put Auld-wont away.â Laborious all the rest invited, To have all bargains whole compleated: So when they'd finish'd ev'ry thing, They look'd all chearful as the spring: Ev'n Burgher, who beguil'd himself, Look'd blithe, although he lost his pelf; Caution no little was comforted, To see the rest as they had sported. Miss John said, âCaution, once you had, If right I mind, a pretty lad: Where is he now? since I came here, I have not seen the boy appear.â Said Caution, âSir, he's gone to see His uncle that is like to die.â As they thus talk'd, they heard a horse Come riding in the way with force: By orders forth a servant ran, And found it was a gentleman, Who hastily began to speer, âWhat company have you got here.â Miss Jenny heard, and fast as able, With Waste-all, rose up from the table, And to the door like lightning flew; Who, when of him she got a view, She cry'd, âMy love, my life, my all, Light down, and into my arms fall.â Then in they went; the rest amaz'd All on the stranger strangely gaz'd: When Caution came to understand That it was Secret, caught his hand, And said, âSir Secret, by your dress, I think we secrets may confess.â âYes, yes, (said he); and now I crave I may her brother's pardon have; For she's my wife now, come what will, To have and hold for good and all.â Said Caution, âIs your uncle dead?â âYes, Sir, (said Secret); in his stead I now am heir, as sure's I'm here, And that's two hundred pounds a year.â Laborious said, âI am well pleas'd, My brother and my sister's rais'd To as great honour and degree, As they were born both heirs to be: I wish you joy with all my heart, And so in peace we'll all depart, Each one to our respective place, And leave the young folk to solace Themselves with love, till the next day We meet again.â Here ends the play. Sung by Miss JENNY. Mankind is like a tennis-ball, Toss'd to and fro by fate. Though one to-day were Lord of all, In honour ne'er so great; Yet the next day reproach and scorn May be his sordid lot; His wealth dispers'd, and he forlorn, And's pleasures quite forgot. Our joys continue but short space; Our griefs more lasting be; We may soon fall into disgrace, Though in prosperitie. We mortals too short-sighted are True virtue to discern; How to escape the baneful snare, We too, too seldom learn. On FORTUNE. I know not what mischievous jarring odds Sometimes fall out among the factious gods: But oftentimes dame Fortune, being blind, She gets a clash or redding-stroke behind, That makes her stagger, and confus'dly reel, And miss the centre of her ticklish wheel; She and her favourites cry barlafumble, While in the dirt they topsy-turvy tumble. Such accidents have many mischiefs done: They kick'd a Charles from the British throne; While on the top he safely seem'd to tread, The wheel soon turn'd, the monarch lost his head. But she by wings still to the top is borne, And in her hand holds Amalthea's horn; Bidding all mortals, high and low, repair To her, and of the same rich plenty share. But that sleek wheel, whereon the strumpet treads, Still hovers o'er the dark oblivion shades: Yet heedless mortals by her philters drawn, To gain the top, their very souls will pawn: Like swarms of bees ambitiously they climb, And wrestle to ascend the slipp'ry rim; Yet some saint-hearted heavy arses sway The wheel half round, thence in the dirt go they, While on the other side aloft some rise, Insulting, as they would invade the skies; Rivals in direct opposition hing, And thousand vot'ries their petitions bring, Imploring Fortune to send favour down, And their endeavours with glad success crown She deals to all, both honest man and rogue, By chance, just as the blind man kill'd the dog: Some get preferment; other some obtain A virtue to increase and manage gain; Whilst other wrestlers, that might merit plead, In no endeavours ever can succeed. Thus she unconstant, without judgment, roves; She'll hate to-morrow, whom to day she loves: And whom she hates is seldom reconcil'd; No more her favours are to them reveal'd. Just like a friend, suspicious causeless grown, Whose wonted smiles turn to an angry frown; His threat'ning aspect dire resentment shows, Though nought save innocence his party knows: So she, if disoblig'd, or, which is worse, If she but think so, doth intail her curse. Great monarchies, and glorious empires, she Has laid in dust by her austeritie; Besides ten thousand thousand families By her o'erthrown in dark oblivion lyes: Nay, heroes proud, that could the world command, Could never her unconstant freaks withstand. Th'aspiring youth need not her favour plead. Nor does she ought regard the hoary head: The rich, tho' rais'd to fame's stupenduous height, Cannot secure her favours for one night: She slights religion, and the learned schools; But favours most the covetous and fools. A PASTORAL between Colin, Willie, and Deavy, upon Baledgarno's Marriage. Three canty shepherds met upon the plain, Chearfu' as sunshine after show'rs of rain: Ilk ane was blithe to see another out, Free on the fields to laugh and loup about. Kind Willie, he, in hamely laughing terms, Claught Colin keenly in his rustic arms; And furthy Deavy, seeing them, grew bauld, His brawny arms soon did them baith infauld. âDear welcome lads, (the blythsome Deavy cry'd), This is the day our pipes maun a' be try'd.â âWi' a' my heart, (quoth Colin), fetch them out, And let us lilt ilk ane a spring about.â Quoth Willie, âThen to take awa' a' grudge, We twa will sing, and Colin he'll be judge: And wha sings best sall be the prettiest man, And a' the flutes sall fairly be his aun. Deavy. What, sall we sing of courts, or war's alarms; Or love, the sweetest theme, and fastest charms? Colin. Naithing but love shall be your task to sing: Love best befits us; 'tis the darling thing. Ilk ane o' you the other's lass describe, That partial love may not your fancies bribe. But I could wish I shou'd na' judge, but hear, I've nae mair skill save an impartial ear. Now, Willie, ye maun first begin the lay, And a' your sweets of vocal notes display: If Babie's beauties can inspire your breast, Sik sentiments will by you be express'd. Deavy sall neist on Annie's charms advance: And, when we've done, we'll tune our reeds and dance. Willie. O PhÅbus, master of the tunefu' nine, Exoner me, and polish my engine! Gi' me that verse, sung in a saft sweet lay, That's due to Daphne, and the honour'd bay! But yet in vain I crave your help, when she In beauty is superior to thee: Whilk ye may view; yet a' your eloquence Can ne'er express her in a perfect sense. 'Tis vain for you to rax aboon your height; Your light's but single, her's is double bright. Thy absence is but night; but her's is hell: In all things else, fair Babie does excel. O lucky Deavy! lucky anes and ay! Happy in Babie's bright refulgent ray; Reflecting on you virtue, goodness, greatness, As in her face ten thousand beauties witness. Babie's a star, ay, she's a lovely star; She's lovely fair, her cheeks sweet roses are: Her smiles! her lips! how sparkle her bright eyes! But in her mind what nobler beauty lyes! I'm sure your senses canna' miss to strive, Whilk sall outdo another when they dive On Babie's beauties; when you see her face, Your sight to hearing surely maun gi' place, To hear her voice; but, when you touch her lip, 'Tis as you wi' the gods did nectar sip; Your sight and hearing are confounded quite, Your touch and taste all surfeit with delight. Pears drop to see her; apples fade away; The purple vine, and olive, baith decay. Wherewi' sall shepherds weave their garlands now, When myrtles, bays, and roses tyne their hue? All nat'ral beauties quickly disappear At Babie's presence, in her bloom maist clear; Her well-shed hair, ev'n parted on her brow, As by her bridegroom, at the marriage vow, Apollo's skill, wi' a' his tunefu' nine, Her simple beauty canna' right define. Out of her breast ten thousand arrows fly, By which ten thousand lovers wounded ly; But sprightly Deavy wan the lovely prize. Thrice happy lad! thrice happy shepherd's fate! That gain'd fair Babie, Babie good and great. I'll mint nae mair fair Babie's charms to trace; Her ilka virtue, beauty, charm and grace Leads aff my thoughts into a senseless maze, Till like a statue, I maun thoughtless gaze; Therefore, dear Deavy, as your rightful due, I'll fairly yield the flutes and bays to you. Deavy. Dear Willie, gin ye shall defective prove, How can I sing the wonders of your love? Sin ye of Babie sickan thoughts can raise, What can I say to worthy Annie's praise? Sin ye prefer to PhÅbus Babies eyes, I can but say Annie's the fairer prize. Ay Annie was, and is! what's this I say? Ah! my unguarded giddie fancies stray, O Pan, recover my tint senses now When Annie's charms in recompence I shew! Annie's a lass well wordy o' your care: A lass said I! ? nae better o' my pray'r; She's now a wise: well snappering nae mair, Need I invoke the rural pow'rs by pray'r. If Annie's self can oughtlins me inspire, I may presume again to touch the lyre: If not, I'll swear henceforth nae mair I'll sing, Nor sall I ever touch the trembling string. If sleepy poppies vie wi' lillies white, Or western shades wi' fair Aurora's light; If black wi' snaw white lambs, or night wi' day, Or dowie cyprus wi' the cheefu' bay; Sae may the nymphs, and maist accomplish'd fair, Wi' sweeter Annie mint anes to compare. Her breast is like a cabinet of goud, Wherein the richest jewels are bestow'd; Wit, virtue, prudence, constancy and love, And a' good things we mortals can approve; Humility, discretion, chastity, And thousands mae that raise her dignity. Her stature's comely: O! her charmtng voice Wad gar a sullen dotard sot rejoice. And you, O Willie, then how bless'd are ye, When to a' these you can have access free? In praising Babie ye my Muse prevented, Or I had Annie's character augmented, Willie. Na, Deavy, na; forsooth I canna' say For compliments, but ye have won the day. Deavy. Na, Willie; you your hyperboles advance Aboon a rustic shepherd's eloquence. Willie. Your Babie merits a' I said, and mair, And has mae virtues than I can declare; For, as I said, Apollo wi' his nine Ae charm about her canna right define. Deavy. Your Annie merits mair nor I can say; For, as I said, if night can vie wi' day, Sae may her sex mint wi' her to compare; Pan or Sylvanus may her worth declare. Willie. Babie frae Colin's ancestors descended; They're much the same, for a' we have contended. Deavy. Your Annie's birth declare her worth and merit, And in her shine our Colin's noble spirit: Ay, Annie bears our worthy Colin's name, That shines renowned in records of fame; And ye yoursel' e'en sprang frae Colin's race: And twice sinsyne the fam'lies did embrace: By Hymen's ties, by him they friendship vow'd; By Annie now that friendship is renew'd. Willie. Babie partakes of Colin's worth and fame, And bears as well a worthy shepherd's name; And ye yoursel' was ay to Colin dear, And now by Babie in a tie mair near. Deavy. There's not a herd on a' the banks of Tay Can tell sic tales as Colin's fel' can say; For his forbears built twa' stately bowers, To screen them frae the winter sleets and showers: On a' our banks nane may them parallel, They cast a dash that a' the lave excel. Now wand'ring Sue the auldest ane possesses; She's left it void, and now it fair decreases: The other now is Colin's residence, For bonnieness might lodge a king or prince. Willie. Well is he wordy o't; and may he lang Possess the same, to judge the shepherd's sang. Colin. To judge your sangs wou'd be a kittle part, Ye hit sae near ilk ane another's art: As in a cock-fight ye your heads have won, Nor by the one the other is outdone; Ye baith deserve alike the wager laid: And Deavy now what ye of Annie said, It might in Willie raise a jealousy, But that he errs in that as well as ye. Keep baith your flutes: and, Willie, I to you Present a garland fitting for your brow; Well wrought of myrtles, bays and roses sweet. Emblems of conquest, peace, and love's delight; A virtuous cleek of silder clear tho' auld, That keeps the tod frae louping o' the fauld: These sma' propines I frankly gi' to you, And wish you heal sangs sweetly to renew. And, Deavy, ye a stob-bairn mauna be, Sae lang as I hae ony thing to gi'; I'll compliment you wi' a pair o' doves, Milk white, as emblems of conjugal loves, And eik a pipe I gat frae Pan langsyne, Whase virtue cheers the heart as well as wine. Now turn your notes into anither strain, Your real judgments frae the heart explain, Whilk o' the twa is best; a single life, Or to be knit in wedlock to a wife? Deavy. In reason Colin ought to be obey'd, Sin for our pains baith you and me are paid: How shall we sing? by turns, or even out? Willie. Lang tales I hate, let's e'en take turn about. Deavy. Then, to be short, a single life is best, If we cou'd live but virtuous, good and chaste. Willie. What anger ail'd you then to take a wife, If ye sae meikle prize a single life? If ane had tald you sae when ye was single, Your judgment to believe't wou'd had a pingle. Deavy. But stay, dear Willie, I've experience, And that, ye ken, gi's fouk a hantle sense: Youth-head is wild, and ill to manage aft, Unless their tempers are but dead and saft: Syne in that case man canna' act his part: The lave befools him, says he has nae heart. Willie. Well, what o' that? youth maun be out, and then We turn sedate, wise and judicious men; Bless'd wi' a wife, get children to succeed In our awn parts, when we are fail'd or dead. Deavy. Of graceless youths there's little hopes that they Will e'er be good unto their dying day: They may indeed get children and a wife; But that ne'er mends their base and vicious life: Their ill example spills baith wife and bairns, And ev'n does ill to a' their near concerns; But virtuous free men's void of houshold care, And meikle lost in keeping house can spare. Willie. The best of a' have frolics in their youth; Age and experience leads them up to truth: A rackless youth may prove a man right wise, And may like you the leats of youth despise. But, to live single purposely to spare For framet blood, sure is the warst o' care. Deavy. A family is no sae easy guided, Nor yet are they sae easily provided; Besides it adds still to our guilt the mair, If we in virtue not exemplar are: But to live single is a virtuous life, And far mair canny than to wed a wife. Willie. Well Deavy lad, sin' virtue you commend, Tell me whereto a virtuous life shou'd tend. Deavy. That question, Willie, is right easie kend, To happiness a virtuous life will tend: Thereby prolong we life, and please the gods, Who take us when we die to bless'd abodes. Willie. Can oughtlins better please the gods than this; Or oughtlins mair augment our happiness, Than wed a virtuous charming lovely wife, Wi' her to lead an honest frugal life; And, as I said, get children to succeed In our awn parts when we are fail'd or dead? Deavy. Ah! witty Willie, I maun awn indeed Ye've fairly hit the nail upo' the head: That's it I meant; a virtuous man and wife May live a pleasant and a happy life; By their examples a' their neibers may Turn good and virtuous, ev'n as well as they. Willie. I trow sae, lad; 'twou'd be nae little strife Wou'd gar ye now forsake a married life: Ye wou'dnae quit your Babie good and fair, For a' the pleasures of a batchelor. Deavy. Nor wou'd ye part wi' Annie's lovely eyes For a' the wealth that in the Indies lyes. But, Willie, see the sun goes out o' sight, And easter shades now usher in the night: On our young lambs the dew fa's wet and cauld; Let's wear them saftly to the ev'ning fauld. Adieu, dear Colin, Willie, baith adieu; We'll meet the morn, and a' our sangs renew. Willie. What think ye, Colin? Deavy, lad, what cheer Can we expect to hae around the year, When the first day our flocks the fields adorn Insensibly we to an end have worn? Colin. Adieu, dear Willie, Deavy lad adieu; Babie and Annie will think lang for you: Let's part the night; and meet again the morn, And sing the blythsome spring and Sol's return. VENUS's JOURNEY. A POEM inscribed to Mr Ogilvie of Inchmartine, on his Marriage. Ye rural Muses, touch my tuneless lyre, And with new fancy all my song inspire: Give numbers unconstrain'd in ev'ry line: May all the poem, like its subject, shine. A fertile plain, where Neptune reign'd of old, And mighty tides with furious winds were roll'd; In midst of which an island rear'd its brow, That all old Ocean's force could ne'er subdue: The nat'ral ash, with shady beeches, spread Around the place, and form'd a rural shade: The Graces there for cool repose retir'd, And Flora spread her garland on the swaird: The choirsters, that charm the month of May, Then sung their matins in the midst of Tay. Martin a saint, searching for solitude, View'd from an height, amidst the raging flood, That paradise, by Nature only fram'd, Fix'd there his cell, and it Inchmartine nam'd. The growing tides this saint did so affright, He utter'd this complaint upon the height: âHere nat'ral beauties deck the place all round; But ah! me fears one night I may be drown'd. Thou Pow'r divine, that Jordan's waves withstood Till thine own people marched thro' the flood, Command this torrent, this proud threat'ning stream, To turn aside, or make its force more lame; That, unsurpris'd, I in this place may live, And ev'ry morning thee due homage give.â Thus said, he to his nightly haunt return'd, And all the night with such complaints he mourn'd; Still praying, that the waves might not invade And overwhelm him in his silent bed: Till near the dawn, amidst the roaring deep, The sounding billows lull'd him fast asleep. Ãolus the while wrought with the flowing tide, And beat with vi'lence on the southern side: That rais'd a gulf sufficient to receive The rapid Tay, and each ascending wave; So that the place, where billows us'd to rore, Is cover'd now with yellow harvest o'er: The lonely cave is now a stately dome; Pomona claims the barren ash's room, Which curiously, where Nature play'd her part, Are beautified and polished by art. The tulips, lilies, flow'rs of various hue, Instead of cowslips and wild dasies, grow. Inchmartine now a safe retreat remains, And Ceres loads her bounty on the plains: In peaceful dust the holy hermit lyes, Succeeded by the ancient Ogilvies. Hymen, reviv'd with summer's fragrant scene, Repairs to visit the fair Paphian queen; Applies her softly that she would engage A pleasure-journey with her equipage, To view dame Nature in her richest dress, And see the swains their lovely nymphs caress. The humble goddess, with a smile reply'd, âWhere would ye, Sir, this journey should be try'd?â Then gratefully the old enamour'd god Bow'd to the goddess with an aged nod: âPlease venture north Saint Martin's isle to view, Where fair Alexis we may soon subdue; Who mourns impatient on the banks of Tay, And knows no reason why he pines away.â Then arming Cupid with new shields and darts, Prov'd armour for the most obdurate hearts, Equip'd for journey, all the godlike train Stood mounted on the wide-extended plain. From off her chariot the bright goddess cry'd, âMy son, approach, come even to my side: Sweet darling beauty, comfort of my heart, To you my great designs I must impart: I cannot call you disobedient son, Since my commands you never left undone, With as much haste as ever you was sent: And wedded beauty to the life go paint, And underneath the fair and lovely scheme Write Rothemay and Ogilvie's fair name, And on the crest your double golden dart, Piercing the centre of Alexis' heart.â Soon as the goddess ended her commands, The artful Cupid ply'd his nimble hands: This piece of sculpture, rare and richly wrought, He finished, and to his mother brought. Then with seraphic speed they wing'd their way Thro' orient clouds of the approaching day: By that the sun had made the morning smile, The train alighted in the beauteous isle. Alexis fair, half walking, half asleep, Confus'd with thinking, fetch'd a sigh so deep, That made the place to echo with the groan; And yet the cause was still to him unknown: At last look'd up, and with new transport spied Cupid's performance, and with rapture cry'd, âYe unseen powr's, explain the artful draught, And from this labyrinth wind out my thought.â At last the optics of his sight were stay'd, Fixing his eyes, the writing he survey'd; Wond'ring again, he view'd the lovely scheme From Rothemay and Ogilvie's fair name; He gather'd straight, he knew the lovely prize, And where the treasure, hid before, now lyes. New vigour started in each nerve and vein, And vapours vanish'd from his love-sick brain: Fir'd with the object, he the object knew, With fond ambition from his bed he slew; Call'd for the strongest and the swiftest steed, That he might fly, if possible, for speed; Whereon he mounted, pray'd his stars to guide His bended course towards the lovely bride. With boundless speed the fiery courser flies Along the plain towards the lovely prize, Where Cupid long before Alexis came, Had fir'd the fair with new uncommon flame: Their sev'ral breasts with equal fervour glows, Their sentiments both fondly would disclose; A thousand blushes seiz'd the tender youth, While he essay'd to open his fair mouth; Thousands of fears surpris'd the fair one's heart, Till he could utter or his love impart. Courage at last o'er bashfulness made way, Both strove in love each other to outvie. What joys, what transport, each by turns did feel, The thousand part no mortal can reveal. Hymen, relenting, crown'd these lovers bliss; Their hearts their hands join'd with a nuptial kiss: Each adding fuel to another's flames; Each who loves most th'ascendant ever claims. Unwearied love, unwasted flames, be thou The dear attendants on the wedlock vow! Let these sweet pair retain Love's youthful fire A Nestor's age, and then with love expire! Their souls unite, like two dear lovers, fly To endless bliss, to love eternally; While their bright offspring, as the phÅnix race, Shall honour, in their turns, the age and place! On Mrs Ogilvie's Chariot-wheel sinking on the Brink of the River Spey. Bright as Aurora on sweet May, When she her beauties all display, Excited by the pow'r of love, Clarinda in her chariot drove: Secure she thought, and nought dismay'd; On either hand a beauteous maid, Whose sweet angelic form and show, All Cupid's art seem'd to undo. As the swift chariot sweept along, Each charm attract'd the gazing throng: So that each swain, as thunder-struck, Stood gazing on the empty track. While the fierce steeds with speed made way, Along the rapid river Spey, Thoughtless of harm, the prospect drew The fair one's eyes abroad to view The river in its rolling pride, And pleasant landskips on each side. But winter storms and summer spates, That brooks' and rivers' bounds dilates, Had undermin'd the bounding brae, Of this same ancient river Spey: The surface hung impending o'er The oozy deep, along the shore. So when Clarinda, in her coach, Too near the confines did approach, The ground deceitful sunk, and stay'd The chariot-wheel: she frighted cry'd, âIs there no human helper nigh, Before we perish here, and die?â Pussilus, a Dutch Captain, rode There, mounted like a demi-god: Yet stupidly he stood afar, Like a doom'd pannel at the bar, And heeded not Clarinda's cries, Nor crystal drops run from her eyes; Though he profess'd a man of war, Deign'd not to help th'affrighted fair. At greater distance than Pussilus, A young knight, stout as bold Achilles, Who acted true knight-errantry, Like lightening flew for her supply. Not like Don Quixote's vap'rish notions; That push'd him on to frantic motions: Nor was his steed like Rosmant, Nor hunger-bitten, tir'd or faint; Nor did he want a spur and whip, To make his courser Light-foot trip Towards Clarinda, thus distress'd, Whose looks her gratitude express'd. New joys sprung up in midst of fears, And drain'd her rapid flood of tears: As sun-beams after show'rs of rain, Shine brightly o'er the moist'ned plain; So she sweet innocence display'd, When he, with expedition, cry'd, âCome, fair Clarinda, to my arms, Secure from danger, hurt, or harms; Come, lovely maids, come safe ashore, The threat'ning aspect dread no more.â By lucky chance, an aged tree Had stood time out of memory, Whose interweaving roots extended Some distance round the place, defended From falling in the mighty deep, Where mermaids dance, and dolphins creep, Until the bold and courteous knight Rescu'd Clarinda in her fright. Long may its branches bud and spring, And on its boughs birds ever sing. Thou bless'd supporter of the fair, The scent of bays and laurels wear, Still fresh and green around the year; And all its kind, where-e'er they be, Be nam'd for ever Venus' Tree. And honest Meg of country breeding, Fond her fortune to be reading, May, as to some Divinity, Apply this consecrated tree; Who'll, like an oracle, proclaim Her lover's residence and name; The colour of his hair, and trade, Shall in a trice be all display'd. Ev'n Willie, when he cannot gain His mistress for affect'd disdain, May to the wood next morn repair, Invoke the tree by earnest pray'r; Thrice round it run, its branches kiss; Syne utter such a charm as this; By Juno's charms, And Cupid's arms, I conjure thee impart, And ease my flame For that fair dame, The Empress of my heart: Tell me if I From her may fly, Or once again renew My wonted art, To gain her heart, And her disdain pursue. To the Right Honourable the Lord Kinnaird, on his commencing Master of Masons, &amp;c. Hail! noble patron of true Masonry, Fame's temple-builder to posterity! Fresh in records shall be your noble name Ingrav'd on pillars of immortal fame. Destin'd by Heav'n, that myst'ry to revive, With fresher glory in the place to live: Sure fervent love to ancient rules and laws, Made you thus honour and support the cause. This secret grand, by kings rever'd of old, Unpurchas'd still for Lydian piles of gold, Now, by your care, in its full glory stands, And mocks the blow of sacrilegious hands: Despises founds and dreadful shocks of war, The storms of time, and tempests from afar. This, all true Masons, unconstrain'd, will own, When your proceedings are to them made known; All in the sphere of Masonry that move, With loud applause, your conduct shall approve. This lodge reviv'd, and by your love allur'd, By wholesome rules, judiciously secur'd To after-ages; those unborn shall praise The undertaking in more lofty lays. Antiquity, with all its glorious fame, Shall be transmitted in your noble name: While Fame exists, yea, and shall still be shown, What Charles Lord Kinnaird has done alone, To rectify and to confirm, what all Accepted Brothers fam'd or valu'd call. End of the first part. NATURE without ART. PART II. Containing Serious POEMS on several Subjects. An Invocation to the heavenly Muse. Urania, if minions mean, like me, Might but a prostrate at thy foot-stool be, I fain would sing some out-lines in thy name; O fire my heart, and bring my soul in frame. Ye heavenly Muse, the Queen of all the nine, Thy inspirations, lofty and divine, Can make a peasant 'bove a prince to shine. To me, illit'rate, clogg'd with worldly care, Extend thy bounty, that I may declare Thy goodness great, and condescending love, Tho' in mean scribbling spheres my pen should move, Yet this thy wonders splendidly displays, When meanest thoughts are fill'd with divine lays. O sacred Muse! thy influence dispense; Inspire my soul; dispel my ignorance. Forty five Wonders; or, an Imitation of a Pamphlet of moral sayings, called, A Book of Fives, or five and forty Wonders. I, in my imitation, turn the strain Unto divine, what may be was profane. The verse has been extracted from prose text. I cannot say that I this work have wrought; For GOD gave me will, mem'ry, skill and thought: Therefore, to thee, O GOD, I give the praise; All's thine I have, my life, and length of days. I'm but a babe, for learning I have none; But yet in me thy pow'r and wisdom's shown; For, from my pen, some things at times have past, That's made myself admire; and at the last, Look up to thee, who guides the hearts of kings; And babes, by thee, are taught mysterious things. Alphabetical Verses on the Life of MAN, being eight Verses annexed to each Letter. A verse may hit him who a sermon flies, And turn delight into a sacrifice. Herbert. With heavenly eloquence, LORD, fill my soul; O fire my dead heart with an altar-coal. Pennycuick. PROLOGUE. Wake, heav'nly Muse, assist my rural quill; Fain wou'd I sing, but, oh! I want the skill. Supply defects, my losses all repair, And let me be the object of thy care. Direct my fancy in this weak essay, While I shall sing man's progress and his way, From infancy and childhood, up to youth, The young man's beauty, and his age and growth, Manhood, old age, conversion, hope and faith, The brevity of all his life to death; As I have seen, experienced oft; Altho' my fancy do not soar aloft, By Nature taught, I sing forth as I can, And style the poem, The Life and Age of Man. An helpless infant, man, at first, appears Upon this stage, perhaps to stay some years. Forlorn by nature, destitute of art, Till those that's more mature must take his part. All other creatures Nature she provides With some defence, as feathers, paws, or hides: But no defence poor infant Man can make, He's so defective, naked, poor, and weak. Behold the infant all in tears doth mourn; Liable to death, to hell, and devils scorn. Danger surrounds him; but, in midst of death, God's goodness lends him being, life, and breath. His providence protects him from all ill; Such is the goodness of his sovereign will. In misery his infancy he spends; To vanity his youth and childhood tends. Childhood and youth are surely vanity, Involv'd in sin and sinful misery. No pleasant flow'r appears more fair and bright Than children do still in their parents' sight. Sure children wise much joys the father's heart; But those who're foolish prove the mother's smart. Yea foolishness in children's hearts are bound; Correction only cures the sinful wound. Delighted with vain idle sports and play, His precious time in madness spends away. Rambling thro' youth, and all its vain conceits, Sometimes mad laughter drives him into frets. Sometimes he's pleas'd, sometimes in anger frowns; Except compell'd, religion he disowns. Sure our Preserver is the God of truth, That keeps from danger poor rash heedless youth. Each passion strong, nurs'd with pure vig'rous blood, He boasts of strength; of each acquirement proud: He kicks and laughs at carking cares of life, Thinks to enjoy untainted pleasures rise. Poor giddy fool! what know'st thou but this night Thy precious soul may take its farewell flight Unto the distant world of spirits, where, While lasts eternity, thou shalt be there? For, sure we are but strangers on this earth; We 'gin to die e'en at our very birth. This earthly house, wherein our soul sojourns, Soon crumbles down, and unto dust returns. Our souls immortal pave their airy way T'eternal night, or to eternal day; To heav'nly joys, or endless woes of hell; Poor blinded youth! to which thou canst not tell. Glad lives the youth in merriment and play; Spends many days insensibly away. His manly actions managing with art, Ere he the secrets of his love impart, By wrestling, running, or some handycraft; For this he knows will prove the wounding shaft, To win the fortress of his mistress' heart; Th'intrigue will hold, if Damon be expert. How high aspires a young man's haughty mind! To honour and the world how much inclin'd! Ambition fills his soul in ev'ry part; And wanton Cupid too must break his heart. The piercing rays from Nelly's beaming eyes, Make him esteem her as the fairest prize. His mind is restless then, both day and night, Till he enjoy (he thinks) his heart's delight. In this vain world he's never satisfy'd; He something wants, for all he hath, beside. Man's happiness, while here, is ne'er complete; Tho' smiling Fortune should his heart invite, To say, O young man, in thy youth rejoice; Taste all the sweets; of all delights make choice: Yet conscience bids him all such thoughts disband; For, know thou must yet in God's judgment stand. Just then when conscience whispers him in th'ear, It strikes him straightway with a painful fear. But, too too soon, he stifles these convictions, And disregards all such heav'nly predictions. As dogs unto their vomit do return, Or sow from washing, in the mire to spurn; So he returns unto his former life, And dallies with his fond new-wedded wife; Keenly pursuing carnal ends, not knowing, That to the flesh, poor harden'd fool, he's sowing; And that, e'er long, corruption he shall reap, And plunge headlong in utter darkness deep: There, ever, ever, in hell's flames to burn, And never, never, from the same return, While God is God, or heav'n subsists in being; Confounded with the thoughts of death, not dying. Less than a hand-breadth, or a narrow span, Is that short age and scanty life of man; Yea, e'en as nothing in Jehovah's eye, Or when compar'd with vast eternity. Much like a stranger in some foreign place, That great affairs must manage in short space, By which he is to gain immortal fame, Or, if neglected, scorn, reproach and shame. Man's life is such, experience doth show; We are but strangers in this earth below. Our time is short, yea, and uncertain too; Yet here we have great business to do: Eternal life, and glorious diadem, Or horror, darkness, and eternal flame. If diligent, the former we shall gain; But, if neglective, we the last obtain. Now, strength of nature makes poor man forget How deep he stands in his Creator's debt. He tents the world, whether it frowns or smiles; Prosp'rous or adverse fortune him beguiles: Either puft up with health, wealth, pride and ease, Or press'd with toil by his necessities. Sure this is true, That great men are a lie, And men of low estate are vanity, O wonderful the goodness is of God, Who man with mercies plenteously doth load! Though he, regardless of his holy law, Runs on in sin, without dread, fear, or awe, Yet God's great goodness holds him in subsistence; In midst of danger sends divine assistance. But sure this will man's condemnation prove, The slighting light and goodness, grace and love. Pensive and sad our man is now become; Views at small distance his approaching doom. When he reflects on time that's past and gone, It makes him sigh with many bitter groan. His conscience tells him he is all forlorn, And that it had been good he'd ne'er been born: At his wit's end, near ready to despair, Scarce dares he venture to groan out a pray'r. Quickly he turns, without the least delay, To keep God's testimony and his way: Yet no salvation this way can he see; For that the law no man can justify. The guilt of sin he from the womb did bring Accuse him sore, and doth his conscience sting; Till in the gospel Jesus Christ he see, By faith, mix'd with pure hope and charity. Rejoicing now, with joy beyond expression, That Jesus Christ hath finished transgression, By nailing sin unto his cross, and then Ascending up on high, in sight of men, To God's right hand, where he, as their high-priest, Makes intercession in the holiest: Not ev'ry year, but once for all obtain'd For us redemption; righteousness unstain'd. See now the glorious privilege of man, More valuable than e'er this world can Afford to any; nay, at cheaper rate: We are the bankrupts; Jesus paid the debt, And set us free; nay more, he gives beside, Fair heavenly mansions, with himself to 'bide, If we by faith claim merit in his blood; And faith's not ours, it is the gift of God. The great transcendent boundless love of God To sinners, such as we, is very odd. Free grace and love to slaves and rebels born; When he oft call'd, we oft refus'd to turn; Till, by his pow'r, he opes our blinded eyes, And lets us see wherein our mis'ry lies; And that he hath a salve to cure each wound: Happy the man whom God hath sought and found! Under old age man seems at last to bow; His flesh turns loose, his forehead wrinkles plow; His teeth decays; his crown all bald appears; His joints are stiff, and deaf'ned turn'd his ears. Phlegm and dire coughs disturb his nightly rest; Sore wand'ring pains his body doth molest. His eyes are dim, he fetcheth short his breath; Expecting hourly his approaching death. Various diseases interrupt his health; He sees no pleasure, tho' he swims in wealth. But if renewed by regeneration, God's holy Spirit gives him consolation. He longs and pants to have his faith in vision, And that his hope were turn'd into fruition. Fain would he leave this tottering earthly tent, To be with Christ above the firmament. What emblem better man's life represents, Than Sphynx his riddle to Thebes' inhabitants? The meaning whereof Oedipus did say, Was, That Man's life was but one single day. His infancy to morning he compares; Full age, high noon; old age night's image bears. Man in his morning creeps on hands and knees; Erect at noon; night comes, a staff supplies. Xerxes from an hill view'd his mighty host, And wept to think how soon they'd all turn dust. How many children in their nonage die! How many when come to maturity! Alas! how many die without expecting! How many 'ceas'd, their errand here neglecting! How few are left, till they thro' age decline! How few reserv'd in heav'n with Christ to shine! Yet, howsoever short man's life may seem, Most part thereof is lost as in a dream, One half we sleep; in nonage reason may Be seen too weak, and in old age decay. Since reason's weak, and life so very short, Let us be caution'd to redress our hurt, By seeking God (since his free grace abound) And call on him while he is to be found. Zaccheus-like, let us by faith climb up By pray'r to heav'n, ere death us interrupt. When death attacks us, we no more can have Of th'world, except a coffin, sheet, and grave. The whole conclusion of the matter hear, Let us be virtuous, and our God still fear; Keeping his laws with all the care we can: This is the duty of frail fading man. CONCLUSION. The letters are what every child that learns, Attains by heart, before he well discerns The sound of words, or syllabs can pronounce. So get these lines, and what they do evince, By heart; and they may give you some impressions, Both of salvation and of your transgressions; Of infancy, of childhood, and of youth; Experience will tell they speak the truth. And, in old age, when more you come to learn, The truth of all you'll certainly discern. The four Seasons of the Year compared to the four Ages of Man's Life, viz. Infancy, Childhood or Youth, Manhood, and old Age. I. WINTER. The absence of the sun gives place to colds; Earth's pores are stopp'd by chilling frosts, and holds All vegetables pris'ners in her womb: All Nature wears an universal gloom. The ice o'erspreads the rivers, ponds and lakes; The bleating flocks with scanty food inlakes. When hills and vales with woolly snows are clad, And storms and tempests all the plains invade, The human race are forc'd to tend the fires, And cattle feeds, imprisoned in byres, Upon the product of their former toil, Till Sol's approach make nature 'gin to smile. Thus, like to winter, is our infancy; We've no perfection; can do nought but cry, Under the load of our first parents' guilt; An heavy burden, too too seldom felt. Unless the Sun of Righteousness diffuse His influence into our souls, we chuse To entertain bleak Winter all our days, And have no Spring, except iniquities. II. SPRING. When Phoebus in our horizon ascends, His powerful heat into the earth he sends, Causing all herbs, trees, fruits and flow'rs to spring, And birds on various boughs to chant and sing. The hills and holms rejoice on ev'ry side, With vernal green all deck'd and beautify'd. The tender buds they by degrees break out, And clothe the trees with mantles round about. The lambkins skip, swift as the skiffing wind, And sprouting corns gladden the farmer's mind. All things look gay: so reason youth inspires; But misimproves't, and yields to carnal fires. He chears his heart, and feasts his wanton eyes On empty objects, and false vanities. Like as the Spring in beauty doth increase, So youth aspires to pride and haughtiness; Boasts in his strength, and other nat'ral parts; Thus carnal thoughts replenish carnal hearts. He shuns the counsel from the wise-man's mouth, That doth advise all in the time of youth, To mind our powerful great Creator, who Can into hell both soul and body throw. III. SUMMER. The warmer sun, and moist'ning dews that fall, Bring to perfection, fruits, herbs, great and small. The western winds puff gently thro' the field, Waving rich corns which fertile valleys yield. The herds and flocks with pleasure feed on hills, Quenching their thirst among the purling rills. The careful ant her little gran'ry stores, Against the winter's chilling sleety showers. The painful bee, with purest honey, fills Laboriously, her narrow waxen cells. In this sweet season, birds and beasts rejoice; All Nature smiles with new supplies of joys. E'en so is man in his full strength of age; Nothing he doubts, no cares his mind engage, Except the world, and worldly gain; he feels No other smart; to carnal fires he yields. With courage stoutly scampers he thro' life; Till grown mature, he fondly weds a wife: Then tamely toils, subsistence to provide For his domestics and his fav'rite bride. Now some religion he must needs pursue; His youthful rambles age 'gins to subdue. Now is the time he gains repute and fame, Or infamy, reproach, and scorn, and shame. All his perfections now are at the height; His sun returns declining down to night. Temptations now will ev'ry day surround him, And many arrows are design'd to wound him. If he is rich, he's tempted to be proud; If he is strong, he's tempted to be rude. If he is poor, he's tempt'd to steal and lye; If he is wise, on's wisdom to rely. If he is foolish, all men prize him nought; If ignorant, he has no sense of thought. If he's ill match'd, he's tempted to disdain; If he is carnal, certainly profane. If fortunate, he fortune still pursues; If hapless, then much discontent ensues. His summer ends, the rip'ning harvest comes; Old age ensues, that brings us to our tombs. The reaper, Death, no mortal can defy; And then, as falls the tree, so must it ly. IV. Autumn, or Harvest. Trees, herbs and flowers now cease their annual growth, And frugal farmers shake themselves of sloth, Call in the aid of lab'ring nymphs and swains, To reap the yellow harvest from the plains. The sickle cuts down high and low; and all With equal fate, are in the sheaves let fall. The best reserved for the next year's seed; The worst for food; for so it is decreed. It must be ground, eat, and cast out in dung; So is the fate of all, both old and young. God, as a farmer, calls his servant Death, Who, with his sickle, cuts all mankind's breath. The best reserv'd for the next world's good, With all the blessings of God's Spirit endu'd. The worst are left for's wrath to feed upon, In endless flames and misery to groan. Thus calls aloud the wheeling year to man, As I have sung. We may by Winter scan Our infancy, wherein we can do nought But mourn in guilt we from our parents brought. The Spring doth shew our growing youth, where vice, With Nature's depravation, doth entice To sin in action 'gainst our God, that gave us Our beings first, and means of grace to save us. The Summer shews our manhood and our strength; And Harvest death, that cuts us off at length. Sure, after death, we must in judgment stand, Either on Christ's right, or on his left hand, There to receive a sentence of duration Beyond conception, far beyond expression. If on his right-hand, we'll to heaven go, Where we'll be free of sorrow, grief and woe. Yea, that mount Zion, city of our God, Shall be our lasting and our blest abode; That holy place, ev'n new Jerusalem, Where we shall shine each as a seraphim. If on his left hand, hell must be our lot, Tormented with a worm that dieth not. As seamen shun the dang'rous rocks and shelves, God grant us faith in Christ to save ourselves. In Infancy our Winter, Spring of youth, Guide us and ours, Lord, in the ways of truth. And in the Summer of our nat'ral days, Lord stablish, strengthen, settle all our ways. And, in our Autumn, fit us all for death, That, in thy favour, we may yield our breath. A Meditation at the Communion-table. What's this I see before mine eye? Behold 'tis bread and wine; Am I a guest to such a feast, Yea, to a feast divine? Yea, more I see; oh! woe is me! I see a mount of sin Cast up before my hard heart's door, And swarms of it within. Nay more, I see Christ Jesus die, And bleeding on the cross, All for my sake, that he might take Away my tinn and dross. I hear him cry, I see him die; I see them pierce his side; I see him bound, in grave-cloaths wound, And in a new grave laid. With inward eyes, I see him rise, And, after forty days, Ascend on high, up thro' the sky; At God's right-hand he stays, Making request, as our high-priest, Before his Father's throne, For such as he shall glorify After this world's done. By this I find, that, in my mind, A supernat'ral change Is fully wrought; whereas my thought On vanities did range. They're fix'd above, and flames with love Towards my blessed Lord, Who underwent sin's punishment For me; and life restor'd, When I was dead, and could not plead, Or merit ought but wrath; But by his pain, I live again, And triumph over death. I now abhor what I before Did love exceedingly; And do disdain the servile chain Of Satan's tyranny. I feel th'effect of God's respect Toward poor sinful me; For, thro' Christ's merit, his holy Spirit Doth plainly testify, That Christ is mine; and doth incline Me to observe his will; For, in my stead, for me he did God's righteous law fulfil. Now, since 'tis so, to God I'll go; For he will me enable Salvation's cup to take, and sup With him at his own table. The bread and wine shews the divine Jehovah condescended, That Christ should die, man to set free; In him the law is ended. From Satan's hands, and sinful bands, He saves us by his grace; From hell and wrath, the second death, And gives us life in'ts place. All glory be, eternally, To him, who, by his pow'r, His life laid down, our souls to crown, And life to us procure: And, when he pleas'd, himself he rais'd, And brake the bands of death; In triumph he, victoriously, Hell's pow'r he conquer'd hath. Those who get grace to see his face, In reconciliation, They, by his love, in heav'n above, Do place their conversation; And are made free, eternally, From any condemnation; They act and do, according to Effectual vocation. They have a right, both day and night, To divine privileges; With Christ from heav'n, all things are giv'n To smooth their pilgrimages. The cloth is spread, the bread is laid; The wine sends forth a smell That makes me long to be among The saints that do excel. In glory high, above the sky, Where this celestial feast Lasts ev'ry day, Lord, grant I may Be there with thee a guest. Meanwhile, O Lord, do thou afford Me comfort at this time: And let me find thee to be kind, And pardon ev'ry crime. When at this feast the bread I taste, It brings fresh to my mind, How Christ was us'd, how he was bruis'd As mill-stones corn do grind. When in my hand this cup doth stand, I think I see him bleed; And, under wrath, to yield to death, Yea, in his en'mies stead. When I go from this table home Unto the world again, Make me to fear and persevere; From sinning me restrain. On the Fall of Man. Altho', O Lord, I was design'd, By thee when I was made, For services that are divine, Soon sin me poisoned: And now I must be made again, And born of the Spirit; Or else, from Scripture it is plain, I'll never life inherit. To the holy Trinity, on the Redemption of Man. Supreme Essence, from eternity Three Persons all in one; Who being gave to all that be, And being had of none. Thro' all eternity thou wast, Now art, and shall be ever; Thy truth and mercy they shall last, Thro' ages end shall never. O blessed Father, who hath sent Thy Son to earth below, To suffer sinners punishment, And free them from hell's woe; And thou most blessed Son of God, Who was so well content With sinners vile to make abode, When by thy Father sent; Likewise, thou Spirit of all grace, That turns rebellious wills To God, and makes a final peace, And them with comfort fills; To thee, O glorious Trinity, Be praises evermore, Ay trinal Three in Unity, Let all flesh thee adore. A Meditation for a Traveller. Upon this road I walk abroad; But, oh! I do not know But death may catch, yea, and dispatch Me, ere I further go. Each step I take, may even make Me step downward to hell, Because I move in sin, and love That lust should in me dwell. I bear the name, yet want the frame Of Christianity; Indwelling lust I love it most, And hug it carefully. O God of pow'r, on me, this hour, Send down thy holy Spirit, And work in me true love to thee, That I may life inherit. Let me still think, that on the brink Of death I daily stand; Since ev'ry hour I am not sure But thou'lt my soul demand. Let me receive that heav'nly joy And peace that's in believing, That I may stand on Christ's right hand, When judging dead and living. I with my soul will God extol, For all his goodness great, And that he hath not, in his wrath, Ere now made hell my fate. Upon the WORLD. O thou, my soul, why in this world Dost thou delight to stay; And as a drudge by her ay hurl'd, Still at her fortune's sway? She's painted o'er with pleasures rare, All dress'd in gaudy hue; She flatter can beyond compare, Yet none of them is true. Like Solomon's vain harlot, she Calls to the simple sinner, Come in, my friend, and feast with me, Of my fine sumptuous dinner. Here's pleasures, pride, and profits too; Here's all things at thy will; Cast off thy drooping cares; come thou, Of solace take thy fill. But thou, my soul, turn not aside; Pass thou not by her doors, For fear she thee bewitch with pride, And spoil thy gracious pow'rs; For many by her have been slain; She strong men wounded hath; Her house the way to hell is plain, Down to the cells of death. Lord, give me grace her to avoid, And slight her gaudy pride; Lest by her means I be destroy'd, I'll chuse thee for my guide. A Meditation for a Fast-day before the Communion. What day is this? I think it is A day wherein I ought To set apart to try my heart; Yea, search each way and thought. 'Tis a fast-day, wherein to pray For grace and humiliation: Before I taste the divine feast, Lord give me preparation. I should be fit, I'm call'd to sit At our Lord's holy table, And there to share of heav'nly fare; That is most valuable. Lord, send a dart to pierce my heart; Increase my faith, that I Thy beauty may behold this day; My soul, Lord, purify. I long have ly'n 'mong pots profane; Lord, make me like a dove, Whose wings are clad with gold o'erspread; Fill me with divine love. I was baptiz'd, and seem'd well pleas'd With Christ's new covenant; And shortly now I am to vow, And shew I am content To leave each sin that I liv'd in, And cleave, thro' Christ, to thee, With heart and mind, and leave behind What tends to misery. My heart, Lord, raise, thy name to praise, With grateful sense of all Thy mercies free, bestow'd on me A sinful criminal. Who'm bred and born in sin forlorn; Nothing but hell's my due: But thanks to thee, thy grace is free, Thy word reveal'd doth shew. For thou hast laid true help and aid On One who mighty is To th'uttermost, to save the lost From wrath to endless bliss: E'en Jesus, who did undergo The punishment of sin, To set us free from misery, And Satan's fearful gin. Unworthy I, yet, Lord, I'll try To seal the covenant, In thine own strength, in hopes, at length, My hard heart may relent. Lord, grant me fear to persevere In ways of holiness; And at the last, when time is past, Enjoy eternal bliss. This Token now doth plainly shew My evidence for heaven: O Lord, I crave, that I may have My guilt and sins forgiv'n. Thro' Jesus' merit, send thy Spirit To guide me in all truth; While here I stay, protect me ay; With new Songs fill my mouth. A Lamentation, &amp;c. O Lord, my God, what can I say Concerning this sad case? This is a sad degen'rate day; Yea, even in this place, We are a people that's secure; No trade we have with heav'n; Yet Satan's bondage we endure; To sin and sloth are giv'n. From Israel the glory's gone; Woe's us, for we have sinn'd Against our God the holy One, And would not be restrain'd. His gracious presence is withdrawn From ev'ry ordinance; O that a day of pow'r would dawn On his inheritance. Because iniquity abounds, The love of many's cold; We're full of putrifying wounds, And bruises manifold. From head to foot, from king to those That are of station mean; All in a course of trespass goes; To sin we all are keen. Lord, we have sinn'd, we must confess, Against thy laws and light; This aggravates our guiltiness, That we thy statutes slight. How can we think to be excus'd When Jesus Christ shall come, When thy free grace is so abus'd By all, both old and young? For Sodom and Gomorrah, sure, And Tyre and Sidon too, It will be better in that hour, Than us who live just now: For, if the gospel had been preach'd To them, as at this day, Their consciences it would have reach'd, And caus'd them watch and pray. The heathens shall in judgment stand Against us who pretend To be in Christ's church militant, Yet have his laws profan'd. We will be forc'd to pray the rocks And mountains, at that day, To fall, and cover us as clokes; But they will all deny. Where shall we go? where can we fly? We shelter will find none, From the lamb's frowning majesty, That sits upon the throne. 'Tis not in man that walks, O Lord, His ways and steps to guide; Do thou thy Spirit's help afford, Or else we'll turn aside. Command a blessing from above, Upon the means of grace; Increase our faith, hope, fear, and love; Give us Christ's righteousness. Fair as the sun, clear as the moon, Lord, make thy church to be, E'en as victorious armies shone With banners terribly: Unite the hearts of all thy priests, In love and concord still: Our sabbaths and our solemn feasts, Bless, Lord, of thy good will. Awaken those that are asleep, That Christ may give them light; Reclaim the obstinate, and keep All thy disciples right. From error, schism and debate, Purge Levi's children all; Give grace and peace in church and state, And bless us, great and small. But, Lord, we hardly can expect Such days of pow'r to be, 'Cause of our wilful sad neglect, And dire apostacie. Thou threatens us, and justly too, Since we thy laws forsook; Thy absence troubles us: do thou Revive us with a look, As thou didst Peter, in the days When in thy humiliation. Exalt us, Lord, and we shall praise Thy name with adoration. The contented Christian, or the Christian's Content. A MEDITATION. Thrice blessed is the happy man That's with his state content, Who trusts in God, he never can In any case lament. True godliness is greatest gain; Contentment fills his mind; The promises are all his ain, And God to him is kind. Afflictions, crosses, losses, all Are welcome to him still; Whatever lot can him befal, He yields to God's good will. If persecution should arise, He bears the smarting rod; With joy he then lifts up his eyes, And firmly trusts in God. If in reproach, contempt or scorn, He mildly bears it all; He minds how Christ's good name was torn, Revil'd by great and small. If adverse poverty and want Should pinch him, he is more, With that same lot of his, content, Than if he had great store. Altho' the fig-tree may not bloom, Nor fruit be in the vine, Yet in his heart should not be room To fret or to repine. The labour of the olive may Cease, and so perish all; And from the fold the flocks decay, Nor herds be in the stall! Yet, in the Lord I will rejoice, My only consolation; I'll greatly joy in God, who is The God of my salvation. A dish of herbs I will prize more; They more content will yield, Than dainties all I had in store, That come from fold or field. What tho' I lose this world's goods? They are but empty toys; God's gracious promises includes My share in heav'nly joys. Tho' sickness sore should me befal, Or sad calamity, I'll eye God's providence in all, When thus he calls on me. These either are to keep me low, Lest proudly I behave, Or spurs to push me on to know What I not yet perceive; Or else they are his chastisements, To shew me how I've swerv'd From's holy just commandements, And nought but's wrath deserv'd. Why should I then fret or repine Against my Father's frowns, When well I know the fault is mine, Yet me he not disowns? Yea, contrary, these shew his love And tender care for me, That I may reign with him above, In true felicity. I'm not a native heir of heav'n; My rights were forfeit all; A bastard, vagabond out-driven, By my original. Yet, wonderful! the mighty God, That made all things of nought, Did cast his eyes of love abroad, And of my state took thought. This wonder yet doth more appear, When God, that cannot ly, Said, if we disobedient were, We should for ever die. Yet, out of love, by wisdom, he, When we were all undone, His word to keep, and us set free, Laid our death on his Son. God pass'd his word that we should die, And he's a God of truth, And there is no iniquity Comes from his sacred mouth. Adam did represent us all In that first covenant; And we with Adam had our fall; Yea, the same punishment Was due to us that he incur'd; A punishment that none E'er could or would for us endure: None could our guilt atone. In earth and heaven none was found To take the book, and say, I'll loose the seals; nay, tho' the sound Thro' heav'n and earth did fly; Till Judah's Lion, David's Root, With pow'r, at last, prevails; The book did take; to solve the doubt, He loos'd the seven seals. May I not then rejoice and sing, Instead of fretfulness, When Christ, the Lamb of God, did bring Us thus in terms of peace: No sacrifice, nor offering, God's justice could appease; Nay, tho' we should our first-born bring, His anger would not cease. For Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Of mere good will, engag'd For sin to bear the wrathful load Of justice all enrag'd. O holy God, I come, said he, To do thy sacred will; Thy justice I will satisfy; Thy laws I'll all fulfil. In room of them whom thou hast chose To be redeem'd from wrath, I'll suffer, that they may rejoice, And triumph over death. All this is matter of content; When I reflect on these, Upon my lusts it puts restraint, And fills my soul with praise. What joy to hear the blessed news, That God to Adam said, Thy seed, in time, shall surely bruse The cursed serpent's head. The morning light doth still increase, Until the sun doth shine; So, from this dawning promise, grace Increas'd her beams divine. To Abraham this was renew'd, And unto Jacob clearer; David and all the prophets view'd Christ's kingdom still the nearer. Then rose the Sun of Righteousness, With healing in his wings; Good will to men on earth, true peace, The holy angel sings. The Word made flesh, dwelt on the earth, Men did his glory see; Eclipsed glory in his birth, To the dim carnal eye. Yet faith sees better far than eyes; It sees a beauty, when Christ in a stable manger lyes, Contemn'd by carnal men. There were who did, and do behold His glory in low station, Such glory as cannot be told, Tho' in his humiliation: Glory as of the only Son, Begotten of the Father, So full of grace and truth, that none Can speak or think of either; Yet so eclips'd, that but a few This glory did behold; The sons of earth could never view The same, tho' it were told Not with a splendid pomp and fame This glory did appear; Not with a great heroic name The prince of life came here. A virgin mean his mother was, Oppress'd with taxes great; She, pregnant, by command must pass To the collector's seat. Unto Bethlehem, the chiefest town, Tho' distant from her home; Inn-keepers there did her disown, And would not give her room. She and her husband then must lodge In some old empty stable; Fill'd with content, they did not grudge At this their bed or table. Oh! wonderful amazing love, That God should dwell with men; That he should leave the heav'ns above, With sinners to remain. Subjected to the law, yet he Is only the law-giver; Tho' he was God, he man must be, Both God and man for ever. Tho' he was the Creator, lo, A creature he became; The nature of angels did forgo; Took seed of Abraham. May I not then contented be? Content above all other; Christ hath become all things for me; He is mine elder brother. When I was in such misery, As cannot be express'd; Christ was a sacrifice for me, Both sacrifice and priest. By nature I'm an heir of wrath, Yet with content may sing; For Christ hath conquer'd Hell and Death; He is my rightful king. I am so brutish, that I am For nothing that I know fit; But Christ to earth from heav'n came, To teach me as a prophet. By Nature I am enmitie Against my great Creator; But Christ he undertook for me To be my Mediator. The devil pleads by law, that I Be justly ruinate; But Christ is always standing by, My stronger advocate, Tho' I have been a sinner vile, And oft did God provoke To thrust me down to hell; meanwhile, Christ is my saving rock. When I was under Justice rod, With guilt and sin all stain'd, Obnoxious to the wrath of God, Christ stept in as my friend. Yea, such a friend he prov'd to me, As I could ne'er expect; He paid my debt, and set me free; That makes me thus reflect. What love, what pity, and good-will, Hath Christ to sinners shown; We made the breach, he did it fill, When helpers we had none. No man had ever greater love Than for a friend to die; But Christ's love greater far did prove To me his enemy. He suffer'd hunger, thirst and cold; He had no where to lodge; Reproach'd and scorn'd, by young and old, Wrought like a servile drudge. One of his disciples betray'd Him with a feigned kiss; Another of them him deny'd; All left him comfortless. He that was judge of all the earth, Must judged be of men; He that was sinless from his birth, Must in a goal remain. From prison to the judgment-hall They brought him; did accuse him; The multitude, both great and small, Inhumanly abus'd him. When they blindfolded him by turns, They smote his blessed face; Their hellish minds with malice burn To put him to disgrace. They scorning bade him prophesy Who't was that smote him last: They all cry'd out, Him crucify, Till Pilate sentence past. His face with spittle all besmear'd, Mix'd with his precious blood; A murderer to him preferr'd, Their malice was so rude. They stript him naked shamefully, In sight of all his foes; And scourged him most grievously; And then instead of cloaths, With purple mantle him array'd; A reed into his hand; A thorny crown on's head they laid; And mocking round him stand. They bow'd the knee, and jesting said, Hail, thou King of the Jews; They struck the crown upon his head, And made the blood out squeeze. The clots of his most precious blood Came trickling to the ground; That all, where-e'er he went or stood, Was all besprinkled round. They all, with one united voice, To crucify him cry'd; To torture him they all rejoice; On him none pity had. They pull'd the mantle off again, His own cloaths put upon him; Yet, notwithstanding all this pain, Not one was to bemoan him. Then was death's sentence on him past, He must be crucify'd: An heavy cross they bring, at last, And on his shoulders ty'd. His nat'ral strength began to fail, That in the way he stood, And fainted, (while they on him rail), With so much loss of blood. A stranger they compell'd to bear His cross with him along Unto mount Calvary, and there They round about him throng. Flat on the ground they laid the cross, And stretch'd him hands and feet, And to the tree they nail'd them closs, To make his pains complete. They set the cross upon its end, And let it fall again; Such cruel torture they intend, His innocence to stain. His cross between two thieves they fix'd; Then they deride him all: And when he cry'd, I thirst, they mix'd Strong vinegar and gall, And put it on a reed, and held It to his sacred mouth. Strange! how these wretches thus rebell'd 'Gainst innocence and truth. The God-head was from him withdrawn; His human nature left With death to struggle all alone; Of comfort all bereft. The pow'rs of hell triumph'd to see Him thus forsaken quite: Those that pass'd by did vilifie, And mock him with delight. He saved others; now, say they, Let him his power exert, And save himself from cruelty, Since he was so expert. Strangers at him their heads did nod, And with blasphemy rave; In God he trusted; now let God With miracles him save. Let Christ, the king of Jews, descend Down from the cross to day, And we'll believe, now in the end, What he before did say. This the chief priests and elders said, To aggravate his grief; Thus God and man they all deny'd This innocent relief, Till he was forc'd to cry, My God, My God, why hast thou me Forsaken? Nay, sure this is odd, That I am left of thee Then must his human nature fade; Now yield to death he must. He cry'd, 'Tis finish'd; bow'd his head; And then gave up the ghost. The sun withdrew his shining light; The rocks were rent in twain; The graves were open'd; saints that night Rose from the dead again. The temple-vail was rent, from top To bottom, at that tide: All nature seem'd her course to stop When he was crucify'd. They'd not believe that he was dead, Until they pierc'd his side; Thence blood and water did proceed, From wounds both deep and wide. Then in a new grave they interr'd His blessed corps at last; And then a great stone they'd prepar'd, Laid thereon, seal'd it fast. Of sufferings a dreadful scene Our Lord did undergo; The wrath of God, of hell, and men, All did him overflow. Then, was not my content dear bought To him that did procure it At such a ransom, that no thought Enough can e'er admire it? O wonderful mysterious love! None like it sure can be; The Son of God come from above To suffer thus for me, Who am the vilest creature, sure, That's this day out of hell; But, by his blood, I am made pure; My sins it doth expel. By rising from the grave again, He took death's sting away; He purchas'd ease to me with pain When I in bondage lay. What more contentment can I have Than see my Lord, by faith, His life resume, and from the grave Rise conqu'ring hell and death? To see him on mount Olives stand, In sight of the eleven, Enclos'd with angels, to ascend To God's right-hand in heav'n. Therefore his people makes request Before his father's throne; When prayer by them in faith's exprest, Christ pleads them as his own. He sends his Spirit us to teach The ways of holiness; His servants he instructs to preach The news of righteousness. O blessed news! that such as we Such favour should obtain; So highly privileg'd, to be Redeem'd from Satan's chain: Not only so, but we are made To our God priests and kings; And Christ shall, as a shepherd, lead Us unto living springs: Yea, and all tears wipe from our eyes, And set our hearts in frame; And stir up all our faculties To bless his holy name. O worthy, worthy, is the Lamb That was for sinners slain; The promis'd seed of Abraham, That gives us life again. When we were dead in sins, and lost, Without all hopes of grace, Our life, alas! him dearly cost, His own life and no less. But now he lives; O blessed be The rock of my salvation; In heav'n he intercedes for me, To my great consolation. His Spirit guides me in all truth, And sets my heart in frame; And with a new song fills my mouth, To bless his holy name. Let seraphims and angels bless His holy name with me; Since I'm a sharer of his grace, His praise I'll magnify. For this I know, and am assur'd, That I with him shall reign; Afflictions here must be endur'd, But lo they want their sting: For Christ hath drunk the bitter cup For sin, that was my due; And from the dead hath lift me up; For he did Death subdue: And in triumph, victorious, he Ascended up on high, And led captive captivity, That did in bondage ly: And he received gifts for those, Yea, those that did rebel, E'en those that were his keenest foes, And nought deserv'd but hell. All this to me gives true content; And my contentment's this, That Jesus Christ doth compliment Me with his righteousness: By which alone I'm justify'd Before his Father's throne; And ever after glorify'd When time here shall be none. Tho' here I see it but in part, And dark, as thro' a glass, By faith, Lord, fix upon my heart What time shall bring to pass. When I shall see thee face to face, And know as I am known, And view the beatific place Of thy majestic throne, Admiring thy infinite love And grace bestow'd on me, In pure unmix'd content above, I'll spend eternity. And when King Jesus shall descend, To judge this world below, His mighty angels will attend Him with a glorious show: With sound of trumpet, from on high, The great archangel shall Descend. All in the grave that ly, Shall hear him loudly call, Arise, ye dead, that in the grave And dust of death do ly, And come to judgment. All shall have Their doom eternally. Then, with content, to consummate, I, with the souls above, The heav'nly orbs shall penetrate With songs of divine love. I, with a swift angelic flight, Shall from these orbs descend, And at the grave's mouth shall alight, My body to attend; There one another we shall greet, With welcomes of content; Then I'll re-enter, when we meet, My old new-fashion'd tent, Made like the body of my Lord, With organs all complete; Free of corruption, and decor'd With ev'ry member meet, To soar with seraphs thro' the sky, And join the blessed throng Of saints and angels, from on high, In a triumphant song. Then, to my great content, I shall Among the blessed stand, At the last judgment general, On Jesus Christ's right hand, And hear from his own blessed mouth, In favour of us all Who have believ'd his sacred truth, That benediction fall, Ye blessed of my Father all Come, and inherit now The kingdom, which, before the fall, I had prepar'd for you. For I was hungry, and thou didst With pity on me think, And gave me meat, and in the midst Of my thirst gave me drink. When I was sick with sore disease, Thou didst me visits make; If ought disturb'd my peace or ease, Thou didst compassion take. When I was naked, poor and low, Ye did me clothing give; And when I did to prison go, Thou oft didst me relieve. Then shall we answer, Lord, we ne'er Saw thee in such distress; This is a myst'ry, we declare, Lord, thou dost now express. Then shall he say, In as much as Thou didst it unto mine, The same as done to me it was; The same reward is thine. Then shall our Lord proceed, and say, To them on his left hand, Depart, ye cursed, hence away, In my sight do not stand; Hence to eternal fire, prepar'd For Satan and his crew; He and his ways were ay prefer'd Before mine still by you: For I was hungry, and no meat You gave me for supply; To slack my thirst I did intreat, Yet this you did deny. When naked, and in prison cast, A stranger all forlorn, And when I turned sick, at last, In all I was your scorn. Then shall they answer, Lord, we ne'er Saw thee in such distress, Else of our help you had had share In each dejected case. Then shall he say, In as much as Ye did it not to mine, The same as not to me it was; The same reward is thine. Then shall they mourn with discontent, When devils shall them lead Unto eternal punishment, Without the least remede. Then we the sentence shall applaud, As past with equity; Tho' in that damn'd and cursed crowd Our nearest kindred be. Then shall our Lord ascend on high, With all his glorious train, Up to his throne of majesty, For ever to remain. Then palms of victory and peace Shall unto us be giv'n; While all the wicked from his face Shall into hell be driv'n. Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard; Man's heart cannot conceive The bless'd effects of that reward We then in heav'n shall have. When we shall enter heaven's gate, Our joys shall then abound; Thousands of angels shall await, Our welcomes there to sound. No more shall discontent molest; No more shall sorrow seize us; We then shall fully be possess'd Of ev'ry thing to please us. No more afflictions; no more cross; And no more fear of dying; Yea, no more grudging; no more loss; And no more pain or crying. No more temptations to assault; No more an evil heart; No more we can commit a fault, Nor from our God depart. There shall be none to persecute; There none to raise reproach; There shall no bribes be destribute; No falsehood can approach. There no division, no debate, No malice, no ill-will, No animosities, no hate; But love and concord still. Nought to oppose our true content; Nought to disturb our joy; Nought there to make us more lament; Nought there can us annoy. O then, my soul, say, be content With all that us befal; Until a little time be spent, Then we'll be freed of all. Then we will fairly bid adieu To all that's transitory, And changed be from old to new, And reign in endless glory. Which that we may, O God, I crave Thy Sp'rit to guide me here, Until that sentence I receive, Before thee to appear. A Soliloquy for an unregenerate Sinner. Ah! wretched creature that I am, To what state have I brought Myself? Alas! now to my shame, Woes me! I see my thought And evil heart did me delude. Ah! still they flatter'd me, And told me that my state was good; But now, alas! I see That I am lost, yea, sure undone For ay, unless the Lord Bring me to Christ, and sin dethrone, And strength and grace afford. My sins, O Lord, my sins, unclean Polluted wretch am I; More loathsome in thy sight I've been, Than venom in mine eye. O what a grievous hell of sin Is in this heart of mine, Which I have thought ay pure within, And wholly to be thine? I am corrupt in ev'ry part; My words, my thoughts and ways; My pow'rs, performances, and heart, Full of corruption lyes. Is not my nature and my will All enmity within? I'm forward unto evil still; My heart's a sink of sin. The swarms of sinful thoughts I have And words, are out of number; Base wicked actions I perceive They now my soul incumber. The load of guilt that's on my soul, My head is full, my heart, My mind, my members all are full; Yea, sin fills ev'ry part. How do my sins all stare on me? How do they witness bear Against me? Woe is me! I see My creditors appear. Every commandement takes hold Upon me, for far more Than thousand talents ten times told, Ten thousand thousand score. O Lord, how endless is the sum Of all my debts to thee! When they in reck'ning, Lord, shall come, Infinite they will be. Suppose all empty space were fill'd, From north, south, east and west, With paper wrote by the most skill'd, In figures of the best, What could from earth to heav'n stand, Short would the number be; When all cast up, the least command Craves more than this from me. My debt's infinite (woe to me!) My sin's increas'd so high; For they are wrongs that's done 'gainst thee, Almighty Majesty. If one work treason 'gainst a king, Altho' he's but a man, Is worthy racking, quartering, Asunder to be drawn. That I deserve far more, I own, Who lift my hand so high, 'Gainst Heaven, and struck at the crown Of God's great dignity. My sins, my sins, behold a troop, Yea, multitudes appear; Their num'rous armies make me stoop, And guilt sounds in mine ear. Infinite evils compass me; Iniquities take hold On me, and sadly terrify Me, mustering so bold. O it were better far to see Hell's regiments on me fall, Than have my sins to fall on me, My silly soul to thrall. How, Lord, am I surrounded so, Before, yea, and behind? How many up against me go? I am undone, I find. They swarm within me, and without They all my pow'rs possess; My soul they have inclos'd about, And down to hell me press. This brood of hell man's ev'ry part, My soul keeps as her own, 'Gainst God that made me; in my heart They do erect their throne. The sands are many, yet but small; The mountains great, but few; My sins are more than they are all; As mountains mighty too. My sins are many, but their weight Exceeds their number far; The pond'rous earth, compar'd, is light, Far lighter than they are. It better were, that all the rocks And mountains fell on me, Than my sins' crushing load; the shocks Thereof most dreadful be. With sin, alas! I'm loaden sore; Let mercy help, O Lord, Or I'm undone for evermore; Do thou relief afford; Press'd down with guilt, Lord, bear me up Under this load I feel; Or I'll be crush'd, without all hope, For ever down to hell. If throughly weigh'd my grief were, and My sins in balance laid, They would be heavier than the sand; (My words are swallowed.) They would weigh down the rocks and hills That in the world stand; And turn the balance 'gainst the isles That earth or sea command. My mighty sins, O Lord, thou knows How manifold they be; And my transgressions o'er me goes; They are not hid from thee. Once did my soul in glory stand; Now humbled is; but where? Once the creation's glory, and God's image thou didst bear; But now a lump of filthiness, Of rottenness a chest; All cover'd o'er with lothsomeness, That cannot be express'd. Oh! how hath sin thee ruinate? Thou shalt be nam'd forsaken; Thy faculties all desolate, Thy chiefest rooms down taken: Thy name shall be call'd Ichabod; Or, Where's the glory gone: How dreadfully art thou down trode, Inglorious wretched one! My beauty to deformity, My glory into shame Is turned now; O Lord, I see What lep'rous wretch I am. When Job and Lazarus their boils And ulcers ran full sore, To man's eyes, nor in his nostrils, Was not offensive more, Than I must needs be, in the view Of God's great majesty, Who is of purer eyes, than to Behold iniquity. What mis'ry have my sins, alas! O Lord, brought me upon? Sold under sin; in what a case I am, to thee 'tis known. Out of God's favour I am cast; Curs'd from the Lord I am; In soul and body I am curs'd; In kindred, state, and name. All that I have is curs'd; and oh! My sins unpardoned; My soul within a step of death; Alas! where is remeid? What shall I do, or whither will I either look or go? God, from above, frowns on me still; Hell gapes for me below. My conscience smites me sore within; Temptations me surrounds About; without, oh sin! oh sin! My soul and body wounds. Where shall I fly, or can abide From God's omnisciency? What pow'r can me secure or hide From his all-piercing eye? Alas! my soul, what mean'st thou now Thus to go on content? Art thou in league with hell? Hast thou With death made covenant? Art thou in love with misery? Here is it good to be? Alas! what shall I do? shall I Live in iniquity? Why, then, damnation, certainly, Will be mine end, 'tis plain, If in a nat'ral state I stay, Or in known sins remain, Ah! shall I so besotted be, And madded, as to sell My soul to flames, eternally, For what prognostics hell? For pleasure, flesh-content, or gain, Shall I longer delay, And in this wretched state remain; I die, if here I stay. What then? is there no help, no hope? Except I turn there's none; Yet is the door of mercy ope' To such a woeful one. Is there redemption, after such High provocation? God's oath is plighted, that is much, To give salvation. He will have mercy yet, if I Unfeignedly do climb, And turn me unreservedly, By Jesus Christ, to him. O God, I'll thank thee, ear' and late, Upon my soul's bent knee; That hitherto thy patience great Hath waited upon me: For had'st thou taken me away In this estate, I had Been cast off from thy mercy ay; For certain perished. But now, let free grace be ador'd, Since mercy it is free; I will accept thy offers, Lord, Thro' Jesus strength'ning me. My sins, O Lord, renounce I will; And so resolve, by grace, To set myself against them still, And follow thee for peace. In holiness and righteousness, All my appointed time; Until that my life's motion cease, I will thy praises chime. Who am I then, O Lord, that I Should make a claim to thee; Or have a part or portion by Thy grace bestow'd on me, Who am not worthy, certainly, To lick dust from thy feet? Since thou holdst forth the sceptre, Am bold to touch at it. If I despair, I mercy slight; Or, to stand off, when thou Call'st me to come, is great unright, And would me quite undo. If humiliation I pretend, And so rebel 'gainst thee, 'Twill prove destruction in the end; Therefore I come to be A prostrate at the throne of grace, With hearty resignation; Extend thy mercy, Lord, speak peace, And give me thy salvation. I will accept, with thankfulness, Of thee, O Lord, as mine; And will give up all, more and less, I have, to thee, as thine. O'er me and mine, thou sov'reign shall Be, and my king and God, Thou shalt be in the throne, and all My pow'rs be at thy nod. They worship shall thy feet before, For thou my portion art; I'll rest in thee, O Lord; therefore Thou art my better part. Thou callest for my heart; oh! that It were made fit for thy Acceptance, blessed Lord, but what A worthless wretch am I Of any gift, or to be thine? But, since thou'lt have it so, I freely do my heart resign; Take it as thine; and O! That it were better. Lord, I put It freely in thine hand; For thou alone canst fashion it Into a mould to stand. O make it after thine own heart, As thou wouldst have it; soft, Humble, and heav'nly in each part, As thou hast promis'd oft. O make it holy, sound and pure; Yea, altogether fit, That I thy favour may procure, To write thy laws in it. come, Lord Jesus, quickly come; Enter triumphantly; Take me for ever to thee home; I yield each faculty. Thou art the way; to thee I come, With guilt of sin o'erload; Thou'rt mediator, and by whom I can approach to God. I have destroy'd myself; but in Thee is my help: Lord save Me, else I'll perish in my sin, And sink below the grave. I, as a pannel, come to thee, With rope about my neck, Acknowledging I ought to die, And worse than death expect. The hires more due sure never were To servants; nor the penny More due unto the labourer; No, not so due to any, As death and hell is unto me. These are my wages due; But to thy merits, Lord, I fly; I trust thou'lt me rescue, By virtue of thy sacrifice, And by thy intercession: Thy teaching, Lord, doth me suffice; Guide thou my conversation. Stand wide, ye everlasting doors; Plain passage that you may Give to King Jesus, and his pow'rs; For he's to come this way, Into my soul and heart, to take Possession evermore: O all pow'rs of my soul, awake, And praise the King of glore. O blessed Sp'rit of the Most High, That consolation brings, Who dost thy chosen sanctify, And guides them in all things, Come in with thy hostility, And courtly 'tendants all; Thy fruits and graces plant in me, And let me hear thy call. Thine habitation make thou me; But nothing I can give, But what is thine, O Lord, to thee, Yet I desire to live. With the poor widow, I cast two Poor mites, as all I have, My body, and my soul, into Thy treasury to save. Them I resign entire to thee; O sanctify them now To be thy servants; then I'll be Changed from old to new. They'll be thy patients, cure them now Of all disease and pains; They'll be thy agents, govern thou Their motions by thy reins. To Satan and the world I have Too long a servant been; Now I'll renounce them all, and crave Thy blessing on each mean. Thy dictates and directions shall Still be my rule for ever; My guide shall be thy counsels all; O Lord, forsake me never. Most glorious blessed Trinity, And Unity in one, Myself I render up to thee; Receive me as thine own. Thy name on me, Lord, write, and set Thy mark on all I have, As thine own proper goods; and let Thy Sp'rit me guide and save. Each member of my corps make thou And all the faculties Of my poor soul, O Lord, for now Thy precepts are my choice. Thy laws I'll lay before mine eyes; They shall the copy be Which I shall keep; and all my days I'll write still after thee. According to this rule I'll walk, In strength of thy great grace; Thy laws shall govern thoughts and talk, And all that I possess. Although I cannot perfectly Keep thy commands, I'll not Allow to break the least, or by Me ever be forgot. The devil, the world, and the flesh, Tempt me, they will, to stop; But thy free Sp'rit will me refresh, Because in thee I hope. Now I resolve, in thine own strength, To cleave to thee always, That I may in the heav'ns, at length, Trump forth thy lasting praise. Whate'er it cost me, well I ken't, I'll lose nothing by thee; Therefore I'm heartily content With each difficulty. Of all that's sinful, thro' thy grace, I will myself deny; To follow thee I will not cease Until the day I die. Thy yoke is easy, Lord; thy cross Is welcome, as it is The way to thee: I'll count but loss All worldly happiness. I'll be content to tarry, till The time I come to thee: Here, poor and low, let me be still Despis'd, so I may be Admitted once to live in bliss With thee, hereafter, Lord; Thou hast my heart and hand to this Agreement, and my word. Like to the Mede's laws let it be, And Persians; Lord, command It never be revers'd; make me For ever there to stand. This resolution I will still Keep till the day I die; I sworn have, perform't I will; And that most chearfully. To keep thy statutes I'll rejoice; I given have my free Consent; my everlasting choice Is made with none but thee. Now, O Lord Jesus, say Amen; Confirm the contract band, That I before thy Father's throne In purity may stand. O thou, my soul, rise up, and sing Praise to the Trinity, Who doth from death to life me bring, And from hell set me free. All glory to the Father, to The Son and Holy Ghost; As't was from the beginning, so Is, and for ay shall last.

The Spirit of the living God Mov'd on the mighty deep; Matter from nothing came abroad, And into forms did creep: Void empty space and darkness did Surround the dark'ned chaos; When the Almighty spoke, and bid Light be, then lo it was. Darkness to separate from light He will'd, and they obey: Light Day he call'd, and darkness Night, And both made the first day. At God's command extended was The spacious firmament, That's like a molten looking-glass, Yet strong and permanent. Waters above it, and below He sep'rated to stay: This firmament call'd Heav'n, and so This made the second day. God will'd the waters under heav'n Together to repair To where he had appointment giv'n, That dry-land might appear: The waters he call'd Seas, and land He called Earth; and they, The instant that he gave command, Did willingly obey. Then said th'Almighty, Let the earth Bring forth grass, herbs and trees, Whose seeds and fruits prolific birth Their various kinds supplies: At his command the fertile earth Did instantly obey; Produc'd her vegetable birth, Concluding the third day. God said, Let there be lights that may Divide the day from night, And rule each season, year and day, And shine exceeding bright: God made the sun, and moon, and set Them in the firmament; The stars also in number great He made for ornament; These he appointed to give light Upon the earth, for they Were to divide the day from night, And this made the fourth day. God will'd the waters to bring forth The moving creatures there; And fowls to fly above the earth In open fields of air: Great whales by him created were; And ev'ry living thing, That either is in seas or air, The waters forth did bring: To ev'ry thing he gave command And virtue to increase Their sev'ral species, that might stand, Till time itself shall cease. Thus God beheld all that he made, And lo! it was all good; The morning and the evening shade The fifth day did conclude. And God said, Let the earth bring forth The living creatures, which May multiply birth after birth, The dry land to enrich: God made all beasts and creeping things, And cattle ev'ry one, After his kind th'earth forth did bring, Ev'n by his word alone: God said, Let Us make man that may Our image represent, And o'er all living creatures sway The pow'r and government: So God created man of dust, And breath'd in him, and he Became a living Soul that must Subsist eternally; Both male and female was he made, Resembling God; and he The pow'r and sovereignty had O'er all in earth and sea: God blessed him, and gave command To multiply, and gave Green herbs to beasts for meat, but man The choicest fruits should have. So God survey'd the works he made, And found them very good. Thus morning and the ev'ning did The first fix days conclude. A Meditation on the Second Chapter of Genesis. Most glorious and holy God, Who was, is, and shall be; Heav'n is thy throne and bless'd abode, To all eternity; The whole earth's of thy glory full, Thy works shew forth thy praise; All nature yields to thy good will, All things thy word obeys: Thou mad'st the heav'ns, earth and sea, Of nothing, by thy pow'r; And over ev'ry thing that be Thou art the governor. Six days, for our example, thou Didst take the worlds to frame; And rested on the seventh, to shew We should observe the same. Thou mad'st the light and darkness, which Are both alike to thee: Sun, moon, and stars, above our reach Their magnitude to see. Thou mad'st thine angels spirits pure, To serve at thy command, To do thy errands, and procure Whate'er thou wilt demand. Thou mad'st man to resemble thee In knowledge, righteousness, And holiness; no misery Obstruct'd his happiness; Inferior but in degree Unto the angels bright; Thou crown'd'st his head with dignity, With favour and delight: Beasts of the earth, fowl of the air, Fifth in the seas that swam, Their due obedience did declare; If he but call'd, they came. Thou mad'st a garden fair and sweet, Where all delight did flourish, Tor recreation, and for meat, All's appetites to nourish: Nay more, to consummate his joy, Thou gav'st to him a wife, That all delights he might enjoy That could be wish'd in life: Save only that peculiar tree That in the garden grew; Of it thou will'd him to keep free, As a Superior's due: Thou jnftly threat'ned, At what time He of the fame did eat, That he should die for such a crime, And lose his blessed state; Not only him, but ev'n all those That should from him proceed, Should share the punishment and loss, Since he of all was head. Most holy, wise and just thou art, O God, in all thy ways; Obedience is our only part, Thy best-lov'd sacrifice. VERSES upon the most remarkable Men and Women mentioned in the BIBLE. ADAM. Adam was plac'd in pleasant paradise, Had all the herbs and fruits therein, to choice Which he should eat, and which he should forbear, Except one tree, whose fruits most dang'rous were, Forbid him (on this peril) by that God Of whom he held his life, and bless'd abode. EVE. Eve, not contented with her bless'd estate, Believ'd the serpent that she'd be more great, Did eat of the forbidden fruit, and gave Her husband also, that he might perceive Things that he knew not, both of good and evil, As she had heard and learned of the devil: But disappointment was their wretched fate; Instead of knowing more, to their regrete, They knew far less, and both were quickly driv'n From paradise, and lost their claim to heav'n. CAIN and ABEL. Abel was good; God therefore him preferr'd, And his first off'ring greatly did regard: But Cain was evil; God did him neglect, And to his off'ring did shew no respect: Which was the cause the villain did embrue His hands in blood, and his own brother flew. ENOCH. Enoch was holy, and still pleased God; Therefore on earth he had no long abode; For God took him alive to heav'n, where he Will reign and walk with him eternally. [Methuselah liv'd to the greatest age] METHUSELAH. Methuselah liv'd to the greatest age Of any e'er was on this earthly stage; Yet of the longest liv'd nought can be said, But that they once did live, and now are dead. NOAH. Six score of years good Noah was employ'd Building an ark, before the flood destroy'd The world for sin; and ev'ry stroke he gave Bade men repent, that God might mercy have: But none regarded, till the deluge drown'd Them all at once; no man alive was found, Save Noah's houshold, eight in number, were Preserv'd alive by God's peculiar care; With two and two of ev'ry bird and beast, That ever since to multitudes increas'd. NOAH's THREE SONS. Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah's three sons were: A father's curse the wretched Ham must bear; Because he saw his father's shame expos'd, And to his brethren had the same disclos'd. Who spread a garment on their shoulders straight, Went back, and screen'd their father's shame from sight. Ham was the father of Canaan: 'tis said By Japheth were the Gentile isles o'erspread: But in Shem's family the church of God For ages had, and shall have its abode. NIMROD. Gigantic Nimrod was a mighty man, He was the first that monarchy began: He and his people, journeying from the East, In Shinar's plains at last their tents they plac'd; âCome (said they) let us here a city build, And an high tow'r, our lives from harm to shield, Whose top may reach to heaven's gates, that when We please we may an access thereto gain; And let us make ourselves a name, that we Scatt'red no more throughout the earth may be.â But God beheld what these vile miscreants did, And that nonght could their enterprize forbid; Said he, All mankind have one kind of speech, And their design is heaven's gates to reach By their hand-work; I will confound them so, That one another's speech they shall not know.â Then ev'ry man spake language that none knew Except himself, and yet he knew not how: âBring me (said one) a load of brick;â and they, Instead thereof, brought him a load of hay: One call'd and bid make fast a rope; and he That was below, made haste to let it flee. Thus all confus'd, their tools they tumbled straight, And like bewitched fools began to fight, All scatter'd round; each one another chas'd; Dispers'd abroad to North, South, East and West. ABRAHAM. From Chaldea the patriarch Abraham, At God's command, a sojourner he came Unto Canaan, which land God promise made To him, that he would give it to his seed, Yet childless, and his wife tho' barren still, She was intent that promise to fulfil; Gave him her handmaid, that she might conceive, And she by her a borrowed child might have. So she conceiv'd, and bare Abram a son, Suppos'd the heir of all his sire had won: But lo! three angels in the form of men Came walking to Abram along the plain, Whom he saluted, to his tent them call'd, And with a rural feast them well regall'd. In compensation they call'd for his wife, And said, âAccording to the time of life, Thou shalt conceive and bear a son, who shall Be thy sole heir, and possessor of all:â At which Sarai laugh'd in heart to hear That one past age, and barren too, should bear; For which they chid her, and affirm'd that she Should the bless'd mother of great nations be. When they departed, Abram courteously And in good manners made them a convoy: When at some distance two went off; but one Abode with Abram till he was made known, And told him plainly that he was his God, And bade him lift his eyes and look abroad, And view the land from North, South, East and West, For of the same his seed should be possess'd. But Abram had forgot God's promise made, And for Ishma'l his son did intereced; âLord, thou hast promis'd, and I do believe That thou to me a progeny wilt give; Therefore Ishmael, if 'tis thy sov'reign will, Grant he may live thy promise to fulfil.â God said, âSarai, as I have told you, shall Bear thee a son, whom thou shalt Isaac call; With him I will my covenant renew Which I have made, and still have kept with you, Lift up thine eyes, and tell the stars, if ye Can number them, so shall thy offspring be; For mighty nations shall be of thy seed, And potent kings shall from thy loins proceed. Also I heard, and gave thee no denial Concerning thy first-born son Ishmael; For he shall live, become exceeding great, And he in time twelve princes shall beget. But I my covenant will 'stablish sure With Isaac, whom thy wife shall to thee bear, And with his seed; and this shall be the sign, That you and yours, yea ev'ry male of thine, Be circumcis'd, and in their foreskin hold My cov'nant's seal, when they are eight days old. They shall be strangers in a foreign land Four hundred years, press'd by a tyrant's hand, From whence I'll bring them by my mighty arm, (And no man shall have power to do them harm), And plant them in this fruitful land, wherein You hitherto a sojourner have been: But thou shalt die in good old age and peace, And the fourth generation of thy race They shall possess the Am'rites land at will, But their iniquities are not yet full.â LOT. Lot, Abram's friend, in Sodom pitch'd his tent: But lo! two angels unto him were sent, And warned him from that vile place to flee, For in short time it would destroyed be; He and his wife, two daughters, and no moe, Deliv'red were from that dire overthrow. His wife, who lov'd the place, began to halt, And looking back was turned into salt: She of God's wrath a monument was made, That others might to God's commands take heed. He and his daughters to a city went; But fear'd to dwell therein, because the scent Of fire and brimstone reach'd thro' all the plain; They fled, and in the mountains did remain: There the two maids suppos'd the human race Was quite extinct, and none left to increase; They made their father drink till he was drunk, Lay down with him when he in sleep was sunk; The force of wine and warmth him so beguil'd, That he unwitting got them both with child: Each of the two brought forth a son, from whom The Moabites and Ammonites did come. ISAAC. Young Isaac now appears upon the stage, Born of his mother when she was past age; At eight days old was circumcis'd, and grew Till he was wean'd, belov'd of not a few, Except Ishmael, Hagar's son, who smil'd When he old Sarah pamp'ring him beheld; At which she said (and kick'd him out of doors) âThis harlot's son shall not be heir with ours.â It came to pass, that God call'd Abraham; To which he answered, âLord, here I am.â God said, âTake Isaac, now thine only son; And nothing grudge, it is what must be done; Take him, I say, and to Meriah go, And on a mountain, which I shall thee show, Offer him up a sacrifice to me: As all is mine, I challenge this of thee.â Then Abram said, âCan this be true I hear, That I should sacrifice mine only heir? Nay, sure I dreamânay, nay, I am awake; Some Deity it was that to me spake. Can God, who is most Holy, Just and Good, Require a sacrifice of human blood? Noâ'tis some daemon, mankind's enemy, That would seduce me to idolatry; God is too good his promise to make void; If Isaac die, my hopes are all destroy'd: But hold! what do I say? why should I doubt Of God's great pow'r his promise to make out? What tho' my Isaac should to ashes burn? God's pow'r can make him unto life return; I in my God will trust, who hitherto All my difficulties hath brought me thro'; Yea, rather than I should my God displease, My darling Isaac I will sacrifice: If I'm deceiv'd, God will my error show, And me preserve from my infernal foe.â Thus forth he ventur'd in the name of God; He and his son upon two asses rode: Wood, fire, a knife, two servants, then took he With him, and went into the land Mori': Three days they walked, till the place they spied Afar; then Abram to his young men said, âStay with the asses, till the lad with me Go worship yonder, and return to thee.â So he took wood, and bound it on his son, Fire in his hand; and on their way they're gone. Now, as they walked, Isaac look'd him round, And said, âMy father, here we do abound With preparations for an off'ring; but A lamb for sacrifice I see it not.â Then Abram said, âGod that requires the thing Will sure provide a lamb for offering.â So on they walk'd towards the place, and there Abram made haste an altar to prepare; And laid the wood in order thereupon, Then stretched out his hand to take his son. Isaac, affrighted, cry'd with tears, and said, âO father, father, I am sore afraid That you are desp'rate, or some frantic fit Has seiz'd your senses, and expell'd your wit: What cruel thing is this you mean to do? Would ye your hands in your own blood imbrue? âNo, no, my son; you quite mistake the case: All human reason must to God give place: No doubt I love you as I do my life; And certainly this sacrificing knife Should as soon sheath in my own bowels as thine, Wer't not I must regard commands divine.â âO father, father, has not God once said, Who sheds man's blood by man shall his be shed? And at the hand of ev'ry man he wou'd Require his brother's or his neighbour's blood? Much more of you: O father dear, forbear, And to seducing spirits give not ear.â âOh not, my son; full well I understand I'm not deceiv'd; it is God's own command: And rather than my God I should displease, My all, my Isaac, I will sacrifice.â âFather, did God 'gainst nature give me life, To lose it by this sacrificing knife? No; sure he did some higher-end propose, Than against nature I the same should lose? Oft have you told me for a truth most valid, God said, in me your seed was to be called: Is God a man, his promise to deny? Or son of man, that he should make a ly? Beware, dear father, what you do; forbear, And to seducing spirits give not ear.â âForbear, dear child; no intercession may Prevail with me my purpose to delay: It is no spirit, but my God; and still I will believe him, and obey his will: I'm confident his promise he'll make good; Tho' here I slay you, and pour out your blood, And I do here your bones to ashes burn, His pow'r can make you unto life return.â âSince now, dear father, you are resolute, And all my arguments you still refute, Unto God's will and yours I do submit, To do with me all that you judge most fit. If you're deceived in this strange intent, I pray the God of heav'n you to prevent; And if it be his sovereign blessed will, I own we should all his commands fulfil: Therefore to him I recommend my spirit, That thro' Messiah that's to come his merit, I may be rais'd from death to life again, And reign with him time without end. Amen.â Then on the altar laid he Isaac bound, And took the knife to give the fatal wound: But lo! an angel call'd from heav'n, and said, âLay not thine hand upon the harmless lad; For now I know thou fearest God truly, Since thou didst not thine only son deny.â Then Abraham lift up his eyes, and spied A ram in thickets by his horns tied: With joyful heart he ran and caught the prize, And off'red him, in's stead, a sacrifice: Jehovah-Jireh then he call'd the place, That is, God will provide in such a case. Again the angel spake to him, and shew'd, That God for this his promise had renew'd, That he would bless him greatly, and his seed Should as the sand on shores be multiplied; That in his seed all nations he would bless, And that their en'mies gates they should possess; Because thou hast obey'd my voice, I will All this and more for you and yours fulfil. So they took journey to return again: And as they walk'd along the lonely plain, Abraham said, âMy son, you plainly see The folly of your arguments with me.â âMy dearest father, now I see indeed God is a present help in time of need; Upon his goodness and his mercies I Will meditate, until the day I die: To us this day he manifested hath Enough to make us stedfast in our faith; I'll ne'er forget how I was ransomed, And in a figure raised from the dead: I'll love the Lord, and serve him all my days, For this is matter of eternal praise.â Thus on they walked, both still praising God, Towards Beersheba, where was their abode. So Sarah died, and Abram purchas'd straight A burial-place to hide her from his sight; Four hundred shekels was the price he paid, For field and cave wherein his wife was laid. When Abram saw his son was grown a man, He to provide him in a wife began; And call'd his servant, unto whom he said, âHere is a point in which I want your aid: Put now thine hand below my thigh, and swear, As thou the God of heav'n and earth shalt fear, Take not a wife to my son Isaac here; Go to my country, and my kindred, there Find out a virgin, pious, chaste and fair, Bring her from thence to be my Isaac's wife, The only joy and solace of his life.â Then said the servant, âSir, perhaps the maid She will not come to do as you have said; Must I your son bring thither back again, In your own native country to remain? âNo, no, (replied the patriarch), take care, And take not back again my Isaac there; For if the maiden will not follow you, Ye shall be clear and free of this your vow.â Then took the servant jewels, bracelets, rings, Gold, furniture, and other costly things, And went toward Mesopotamia, And near the town where Nahor dwelt did draw. Then towards ev'ning, near the city he Stood by a well; and praying earnestly, He said, âO Lord God of my master, now Unto my master's son thy kindness shew: Send me good speed; and let it be, when I The damsels come to draw their waters spy, And she to whom I say, Maid, draw for me, Shall answer, I will you and yours supply, Let it be her thou hast ordain'd thro' life To be my master's son young Isaac's wife.â When he had ended this his wishful pray'r, Rebekah came, who did a pitcher bear; Which when she fill'd with water, âMaid (said he) Allow a draught thereof I pray to me.â âMy lord (said she) it is at your command, And straight let down her pitcher on her hand; Also I'll draw for all thy camels, till They ev'ry one of them shall drink their fill.â The man then wond'ring at her beauty, said, âWhose daughter art thou, O thou charming maid? And can your father lodge us here this night, Until we see the morrow's morning light? Said she, âI am Bethuel's daughter, he The son of Nahor; that's my pedigree: Also we want not room for you to lodge, And likewise straw and provender I judge.â Then pull'd he forth a great ear-ring of gold, And bracelets, saying, âMaid, I pray thee hold, For your good will and service done to me, Too small regard to be bestow'd on thee.â Then ran Rebekah; and her mother told About the man, and of her gifts of gold; Which when her brother Laban saw, he ran, And courteously intreated in the man, And gave him water there to wash his feet, Set meat before him, urging him to eat; But he refus'd; said, âI'll not eat a crumb, Till I have told the errand I am come.â Then Laban said, âSpeak on, Sir, let us hear; You shall be welcome to our utmost here.â Said he, âMy master Abraham is one Whom God hath bless'd with riches, and a son That's grown a man, his only hopeful heir; Wherefore he made me to protest and swear, That I should take my journey to this place, And fetch a wife for him of his own race: Also I see, so far as I have gone, That God doth bless the enterprize begun; For, as I stood by yonder well, I pray'd That God would send to me the very maid He had provided for my master's son, And by that means I wish'd she might be known; If I said, âMaiden, I am very dry, Pray let me have some water for supply, If she should say, âSir, I will give to you, And to your servants, and your camels too;â Let that be her from whom these words shall flow, That God ordains shall to my master go: Scarce had I done with praying in my mind, When lo! Rebekah came, and prov'd so kind. Then did I ask her of her kindred syne, And found that she was of my master's line: Then did I worship rev'rently the Lord; And call'd my master's words unto record, âGod will (said he) his angel send with you, And guide you to the place, and maiden too: Therefore, if you regard my master say; If otherwise, then frankly tell me, nay; That I may turn to either hand, and see What success God provided hath for me.â Then answer'd Laban and Bethuel both, âFriend, to dissemble we'll be very loth; The thing, it seems, proceeds from God alone, And cannot sure by us be overthrown: Behold Rebekah! let her with you go, And be his wife, since God will have it so.â So when the man had heard this kindly word, He bow'd his head, and worshipped the Lord, Did eat and drink, and went to sleep that night, And rose to-morrow by the morning light. Then said he, âSince the Lord hath prospered My journey hither, I would now implead You not to hinder, but send me away Unto my master without more delay.â Said they, âWe'll call the damsel in, and see If she inclines to go along with thee: She being call'd, did instantly consent To go with him, seem'd very well content. Then did they bless her, and sent her away; And to Canaan they came without delay. Now as they walked, and drew near their home, They spied a man out in the fields to come: Rebekah said unto the servant, âSee, There is a man that meets us, who is he? His looks are steady, and his pace but slow, And with a careless air he seems to go.â The servant said, âIt is my master's son, He loves to walk forth in the fields alone To meditate on things that are divine, That elevates his good and holy mind; For he is good, and leads an holy life, With him you'll be a very happy wife.â Then did Rebekah vail her face, that he At first might not her virgin blushes see, While Isaac took her by the hand, and went With her unto his mother Sarah's tent: So she became his wife, with love transported: After his mother's death he was comforted. Then Abraham took him another wife, With whom he spent his residue of life. By whom he sev'ral other children had: To each of them he certain portions paid; But unto Isaac, his beloved heir, He gave his stock, and all he had to spare; So Abraham gave up the ghost and died, And was by Sarah in Macphelah laid. Now Isaac pray'd his wife a child might have (For she was barren), and she did conceive: And lo! the children struggled in her womb, As if each grudged of too little room; Then she enquir'd of God the reason why That she was troubled after such a way; God told her, twins were in her womb, and she The mother of two diff'rent sons must be; Two kinds of people shall from thee divide, The younger o'er the elder shall preside. So in due time Rebekah at one birth Two lively children that were males brought forth: The boy first born was all o'ergrown with hair, And Esau nam'd; the other smooth and fair, And Jacob nam'd, because he strove to feel, When he was born, his brother Esau's heel: Both circumcis'd when they were eight days old; Both grew to men, and Esau rough and bold Was a great hunter of wild venison, But Jacob dwelt in tents upon the plain. Now Isaac loved Esau, for the meat He often of his venison did eat: But lo! Rebekah loved Jacob best, And often in her heart she Jacob bless'd. One day, as Esau had at hunting been, He turned faint; and after he had seen Some pottage Jacob for himself made ready, His wish was eager, and his eyes were steady, And said, âDear brother, pray now give to me Some of your pottage, for I'm like to die.â Then Jacob said, âSell me thy birth-right now, And I'll the pottage frankly give to you.â âTush, tush! (said Esau) take it unto thee, 'Tis of small value when I'm like to die.â Said Jacob, âSwear that this birth-right of thine In ev'ry point shall afterwards be mine:â So Esau sware; and Jacob gave him bread, And pottage both: thus was the bargain made, Then Isaac called Esau his first-born, And said, âMy son, you see with age I'm worn: Mine eyes are dim; my taste is almost gone; Go therefore out, and catch some venison, And make me meat, such as I love, that I May eat, and bless thee here before I die.â Rebekah hearing what was said and done, She call'd for Jacob her beloved son, And told him all, bids him go to the fold, And on two fat and well-grown kids lay hold; I'll make that meat your father loves, that he May eat, and bless thee now before he die. But Jacob said, âMy brother is all hair, My father knows that I am smooth and bare; If he shall feel me, and the cheat discover, He'll count me nothing but a false deceiver: Thereby I would incur his cursing rather Than the kind blessing of a loving father.â Rebekah said, âObey my voice: let me The only object of his cursing be:â Jacob obey'd; she made the sav'ry meat, And cunningly she to conceal the cheat Took Esau's garments, judging it no sin, And cloth'd him therewith, and the hairy skin Put on the smooth parts of his hands and neck, That so his father might not him suspect. The good old man thought 'twas his eldest son, Bless'd him as such: and Jacob scarce outgone, When Esau from his hunting came, and had Of's venison the sav'ry morsel made, Yet miss'd the blessing; and resolv'd to slay His brother Jacob, but he fled away To Padan-aram, there to save his life, Where fourteen years he served for a wife. Jacob became exceeding rich, and had Twelve sons, by whom a nation was o'erspread: Great kings, and many, from him did proceed, As unto Abraham God had promised. JOSEPH. Joseph was sold in Egypt for a slave: But he fear'd God, and did so well behave, That soon he was advanc'd to high degree, And none in Egypt more esteem'd than he. MOSES. Like Moses, none of all the human race Of God had so much countenance and grace: For meekness he all other men excell'd; Yet at the waters rashly he rebell'd: So that the promis'd land afar he view'd; But there to enter he was not allow'd. JOSHUA. Brave Joshua led Isra'l to Canaan, Fought valiantly, subdu'd each heathen man; Parted the land, and in proportion gave To ev'ry tribe, what they by lot should have. Still resolute to serve the Lord was he; And so in peace and good old age did die. HANNAH and SAMUEL. Thus Hannah pray'd most fervently in thought, And earnestly from God a child besought; âAnd if (said she) God me a man-child give, I'll lend him to the Lord while he shall live.â So she conceiv'd, and Samuel did bring forth, A man of great integrity and worth. DAVID. David, a man of early piety, And so God rais'd him to great dignity, From a mean shepherd to a royal throne; Such is God's goodness unto ev'ry one That fear and serve him with their heart and mind: Who seek God early will him surely find. ABSALOM. Absalom for beauty did excel, Yet he against his father did rebel, For which he was in battle overthrown, And doubtless unto hell the wretch is gone So beauty is no sign of goodness, sure; Fair Helen was but an adult'rous whore. SOLOMON. King Solomon, the wisest of mankind; And yet he prov'd an arrant fool, we find. MANASSEH. Manasseh was a wicked wretch; yet he Found mercy when he sought it earnestly: Yet this is no encouragement to sin; It only shews great sinners sav'd have been. JOB. Job patiently did great afflictions bear; He feared God, and held religion dear: So that his wife, his friends, and Satan's art Could never make him from it once depart. ESTHER. God's providence brought Esther to a throne, To save the Jews from being overthrown. HAMAN. Upon the gallows Haman had design'd For Mordecai, himself was hang'd we find, Pride and unjustice sure at length will be Brought to disgrace and endless misery. The PROPHETS. The Prophets all were holy men, and were Inspir'd of God his purpose to declare. Saint JOHN the Baptist. He honour'd was to go before, and tell Redemption was at hand for Israel. JOSEPH and MARY. Joseph and Mary well met man and wife, Both just and good, and happy in their life: The blessed mother of our Lord was she; And he his father was suppos'd to be. The four EVANGELISTS. Four write the hist'ry of our blessed Lord; They all in one and the same things accord: All pointedly relate his lowly birth; His life, and doctrine taught by him on earth; His cruel death; how from the dead he rose, And his ascension each exactly shows. The twelve APOSTLES. Christ twelve Apostles chose, to witness bear Of all he said, and did, and taught while here; And that they might his doctrine spread abroad, As they should after be inspir'd of God. JUDAS. But one of them a trait'rous wretch did prove, For money did forfeit his master's love: But he despair'd, and after hang'd himself; Surely to him it was a dear-bought pelf. HEROD. Proud Herod, when prais'd by a foolish mob, Did the Almighty of his glory rob: So that God's judgments seiz'd him in a trice, That he was eaten quick of worms and lice. REMARKS. [I.] The godly man stands on the surest ground; For he seeks help where help is to be found: But lo! the wicked are in dreadful case; Destruction follows them from place to place. II. A fool for Christ is certainly most wise, Though all the rest of mankind him despise: They're only fools that wealth and honours make Their god while here, and the true God forsake. For nat'ral fools I have nothing to say, But leave their event to the judgment-day. III. That man his journey likely overtakes, Who in the morning slumb'ring sleep forsakes. Rising betimes, he briskly takes his way, Before the sun his sultry beams display: Still making progress, ev'ry step doth tend To make him at the last his journey end. IV. A rogue detected by proof rightly led, Reason for him can no excuses plead: As is his crime so must his sentence be; It is unjust to let a rogue go free; For, when he's punish'd, others may take care, And not involve themselves into the snare. Sure rogues are plagues unto society; So reason says, that ev'ry rogue should die. V. When surly winter with his blasts appear, The most inclement season of the year, The chilling frosts and icy snows descend; 'Gainst them the flow'rs cannot themselves defend; And blust'ring Boreas thunders o'er the plain, And robs the fields of all their vernal green: So, when the wicked o'er the godly reigns, They're made to languish and submit to chains. Fifty Golden Verses. 1 There's few or none, that e'er communion had With God, who are not sometimes sunk and sad. 2 Where ends the work of ministers, therein The work of hearers always should begin. 3 It shews to God we have but little love, In duties, if unwilling we shall prove To come thereto, and stay with weariness, And going from them gladness we express. 4 A man in gifts may be exceeding fat; Yet lean in grace, yea unregenerate. 5 In want of all things, I can taste and see How sweet the Lord is many ways to me. 6 Whate'er we suffer, or whate'er it bring, 'Tis sweetest music to hear conscience sing. 7 Repentances gray-headed seldom prove Of the right kind, descending from above. 8 To worldly things our thirst should be but cold; To heavenly things inflamed, and most bold. 9 'Tis ease for men to fly from duty's way: But who can shun th'account at the last day? 10 Thyself to duties customarly take; But do not duties for mere custom's sake. 11 Out of your houses shut them with disdain, Who will your God in no ways entertain. 12 Associate not with those as friends to thee, That shew themselves God's enemies to be. 13 They cannot be reputed worth men's trust That unto God incline to be unjust. 14 Do thou not venture duty to decline, Thy liberty pretending to maintain. 15 By this day's practice be thou still intending The past days errors and misdeeds amending. 16 I fear my duties more than sins by far; Duties puff up, by sins we humbled are. 17 'Tis well if, when Rome's reliques 'mongst us be; They don't possession keep for popery. 18 Sleep not at night till thou recal to mind What actions thou hast done the day behind. 19 Family passions cloud faith, and disturb Our duties, yea and all our comforts curb. 20 His stock of comforts never can he spent Who with God's providence lives ay content. 21 That man can never want his will, whose wit Doth always to God's holy will submit. 22 They need not of another's bucket drink, That live always upon the fountain brink: Nor crutches use, nor stilts of greater length, Who always are supplied with sp'ritual strength. 23 Let governors and parents always give A good example in the sphere they live; That so their children, and their servants, may Be influenc'd to practise good thereby. 24 Afflictions that are sanctified do prove The truest tokens of a special love. 25 If that our houses be not nursing places For heav'n, and also for the heav'nly graces, They'll places be for breeding brands for hell, And ev'ry vice will flourish therein well. 26 Whatever sins in others you'd reprove, Take double care these sins you do not love. 27 Early beginning in true piety Makes one quite easy when he comes to die. 28 Defer not that till last which cannot be Done oversoon, if undone ruins thee. 29 T'eternity to live on we no more Have, but what here in time we lay in store. 30 To be reproach'd for early piety. Far better is than damn'd eternally. 31 Good education makes good families, And they again pure churches multiplies. 32 He that's content is rich, tho' ne'er so poor; But poor, tho' rich, that can't content procure. 33 Two jubilees are held in heav'n: the one Is when the angels sing before the throne At the conversion of a sinner; next Is when he is in heav'nly glory fix'd. 34 Bad times to live in are, for certainty, The best of times for a good man to die. 35 Afflictions are hard meat for any taster; But patience surely is a good digester. 36 Our spiritual state's best by our actions known, Not only merely by a single one. 37 A Christian will not overtake a sin; Yet the sincere hath overtaken been. 38 Sure sad conclusions might be drawn, and would 'Gainst some saints eminent, if that we should Judge by the rule of some bad actions they Were guilty of when in their house of clay. 39 As charitable to others if we were, 'Twere good, as partial to ourselves we are. 40 The best of saints assurance ne'er could gain, If't did consist with no imperfect stain. 41 Cross sanctified hath in it mercies more, Than comforts that unhallow'd are restore. 42 The company a man keeps ordinar'ly Upon his life is a true commentary. 43 True godliness, tho' persecute, should be Our choice before prophane prosperity. 44 'Tis faith's true nature always to make nigh The things belonging to futurity. 45 It is difficult not to sin, when we Our passions vent, and very angry be: But dang'rous sure when anger we are in, If by our passions we give place to sin. 46 Good scripture logic, sure it is, from thence To draw conclusions of our confidence, From premises of pure experience. 47 The poorest person in this world hath more Than he brought with him of this earthly store: And more than he can carry hence away, When his dead corps shall mingle with the clay. 48 Duties are dang'rous when they're rested in, Even as well as unrepented sin. 49 If mercy be not as a loadstone here Unto our God to draw us still more near, It will be as a milstone I can tell To sink us deeper in the lowest hell. 50 'Tis sad to lose good men in any ways, Yea in the best and most serenest days: But when we lose them in the worst of times, It looks like judgment on us for our crimes. An ACROSTIC. Just men and faithful from the earth decay, And godly men do daily fade away. Mourn, mourn, the loss; oh! Scotland hear the call, Ev'n pillars of the earth we see them fall; Shall we not dread the overthrow of all. Doubtless the righteous are call'd off this stage, Out of the way when God's fierce wrath shall rage, While hypocrites are left to feel the smart, God only knows the secrets of the heart: Love waxeth cold, iniquities abound, Among all ranks in ev'ry where around: Sure they are bless'd that are in Jesus found. An ACROSTIC. I while alive did never cease to give, On all occasions, counsel how to live, How to behave in this vain world below, Not to be doom'd unto eternal woe. But now I'm dead, and no more can I say, Except my tombstone bid you not delay A moment longer in your soul's concern, Till Christ in you be formed you discern. O mind how dismal your last end will be, Not to be found in Christ when you're to die! An Epistle, or New-year's Gift, to a young Merchant in Perth, January 1st 1751. This small Propine that I have penn'd A new year's gift to you I send; In hopes it will accepted be, From one that has regard for thee. What counsel here I do suggest, Altho' it be not well express'd, You'll pardon; for I had not time To write good numbers, sense or rhyme. Look round the world, my lad, and see, If providence befriends not thee: See thousands of as high a birth Slaves unto toil, and low as earth; While you sit easy, clean and neat, And feed upon the best of meat; Have company of ev'ry sort, To which you will to make resort. But be advis'd to have a care, The worst of company forbear: Bad company corrupts a youth; Beware thereof, and cleave to truth. Consider what Almighty Jove Has done for you, and learn to love Him for his goodness unto thee, And follow after piety Lay something up, for fear old age With you shall happen to engage: Wait on your business, and spend Conform each day as you have gain'd. Keep two diurnals, and each night Look o'er them both if they be right; I mean, what progress you have made Both towards heav'n, and in your trade. If at old age you don't arrive, You may have children four or five, And leave them tender, young and bare, If of your trade you take not care. Beware of pride; let not your gain Puff up your mind, and make you vain: Nor at your loss dejected be; Remember all's but vanity. Suppress each carnal appetite, And never set your heart's delight On pleasures that are momentary; For all things here are transitory. And cherish ev'ry pious thought You by God's Spirit have been taught; For pleasures that come from above You'll find the most substantial prove. If you incline to take a wife, An helper meet for you thro' life, Seek first direction from above, Where, and on whom to fix your love, And be advis'd good heed to take, Wed not a wife for money's sake; For love of pelf comes from the devil, It causeth much mischief and evil: Let not a Beauty tempt thy choice, Nor yet a wanton charming voice; For these may draw you in a snare, Therefore, my friend, pray have a care: Not the externals of a woman Should be admir'd, tho' these are common; But seek for one, till her you find That has her beauties in her mind. Farewel, my lad; I you commend To him that's able to defend Both you and me from evils all, That any ways can us besal. I am, Yours, &amp;c. ALEX. NICOL. POSTSCRIPT. If any time you have to spare, Unto booksellers shops repair, Where you your choice of books will find, By which you may improve your mind; And what you fancy take away, And for each night what's custom pay: No time nor cost can better be Spent, than in dead men's company. Take care what books you chuse to read, So that they alter not your creed; For books of heresies delude, And do more evil far than good. But innocent diversions may Sometimes perhaps come in your way; Take part thereof, not to excess, They will your spirits much refresh. A. N. The Brevity of Human Life. What's human life? alas! what need I ask? To tell, none can adventure such a task. Some say, a vapour; some, an empty dream; Some say, 'tis like a bubble in a stream; Some less than nothing, or mere vanity, Or like a cloud before the winds that fly. We cannot call it life; for life's a name That none of all the human race can claim: For here we stay, but as it were to bait, And soon remove into another state. We can't remember how we came to be, Nor accidents prevent, or them foresee. Death dogs behind us; yea, and ev'ry hour, He doth some part of our frail life devour. What we call life is nothing but deceit, A counterfeit, a nothing, and a cheat: For we are apt to think to-morrow will Repay what we to-day have reck'ned ill: To-morrow comes, perhaps, and yet we find Its promises more empty are than wind. Ev'n like the brooks that after sudden rain Run rapidly, and travellers detain; These travellers again that way return, And find its banks and channels deep are worn: Panting with thirst, yet can have no supply; By summer's drought these brooks are parched dry: By these of old, Sheba's and Tema's troops, Were disappointed of their foolish hopes. Objects of sense, yea whether pain or pleasure, Steal off the time by which our life we measure: Then all that's past is like a tale that's told, All is but glass, instead of upright gold. We seek for joy and satisfaction where Nothing is found but sorrow, toil and care. All the four ages of our longest life Are folly, sin, hard labour, pain and grief. Tost to and fro the little time we live, All we enjoy no solid joy can give. From one extreme we rush upon another, And all our hopes in disappointment smother. As sparks of fire fly upward, nat'rally, Our life to troubles hath a tendency. No part or scene of human life is bless'd; For with afflictions God still tries the best, And punishes the vicious, and his wrath Pursues them still both at and after death. So that if we the sweets of life would taste, Sweets most substantial, that for ever last, We must to God's good will always submit, Who will dispose of us as he thinks fit. Our transitory life, uncertain, and so short, Must be well spent, if we would have comfort; Each day we live still learning how to die, And where to fix for our eternity. Tho' to long time our lives cannot extend, Yet our existence is not at an end: Here we must win eternal well or woe, Ere death at last shall strike the fatal blow. The Eighth Chapter of Solomon's Proverbs. Doth not Eternal Wisdom cry, Let sons of men rejoice, When Jesus Christ most pleasantly To you lifts up his voice? As't were, upon each height he waits, By ev'ry path and way: At village doors and city gates, He calling thus doth say; âTo you, O mortal men, I call; My voice is unto thee, Or high or low, or great or small, That son of Adam be. Ye that are simple, understand My wisdom, and be wise; Ye fools give ear to my command, And me no more despise. Hear: for I'll speak things excellent, My lips right things express: To speak the truth is my intent, I hate all wickedness. All words that from my mouth proceed Are in pure righteousness; No froward thing's in them indeed, Or ought that is perverse. They all are plain to him that is To understand inclin'd; And right to him that only does On knowledge set his mind. Take my instruction, and withhold Thine heart from silver bright; My knowledge rather than fine gold That glisters in thy sight: For Wisdom sure is better far Than richest rubies be, And all things else inferior are Can be desir'd by thee. I Wisdom still with Prudence dwell, I knowledge out do find Of witty things that do excel, And fit to store the mind. The fear of God is to hate still All arrogance and pride; The froward mouth and way that's ill, I cannot them abide. Good counsel I can only give, And Wisdom that's divine; I understanding am, I have Strength; yea, all things are mine. By me kings reign, and princes, they Their justice do decree; By me they rule, and nobles sway, And judges all that be. I love them all most ardently That have true love to me; Who seek me early, certainly I found of such shall be. True wealth and honours are with me, My riches last for ay; With righteousness they deck'd shall be That walk within my way. My fruit surpasseth gold most fine; My revenues exceed The choicest silver from the mine, That's often purified. I lead in the most pleasant way Of righteousness divine; Amidst the paths of judgment I Continually incline: That I may cause them that me love True substance to inherit, I'll fill their treasures from above With graces of my spirit. The Lord Jehovah me possess'd From all eternity, Before his works of old, at first Was none but he and me. I was set up e'er time took place, From all eternity; Before the earth in being was, Then, and before, was I: When depths were none, brought forth was I, When waters none could spring, Before the hills and mountains high God did in being bring: While as the earth he had not made, Nor fields nor forests fair, Nor highest part of dust was laid, I then existing were: When he prepar'd the heav'ns above, And fix'd the spangled sky, Wherein the various planets move, There with him, then, was I: When on the depth a compass he Did set upon its face, And fix'd the clouds above that be, And fountains knew their place; When he the sea fix'd and decreed His order not to pass, When he the earth's foundation did Appoint to know its place; Then I was by him, like as one Brought up with him, and I Was his delight, and joy'd alone Before him constantly; Rejoicing in that part of earth, Where saints were to remain; And my delights, e'er they took birth, Were with the sons of men. Now therefore, O ye children dear, Attend to me always; For blessed are they that me hear, And ever keep my ways. Hear my instruction, and be wise, And do it not refuse; For blessed are they that always To hear my words do chuse: Who watches daily at my gates Good counsel he shall gain; Who at my door-posts daily waits, My favour shall obtain: For whosoever findeth me, Their life shall surely save; They of the Lord shall blessed be, And still his favour have: But he against me that doth sin, His own soul wrongeth sore; All they that hate me do incline That death should them devour.â The Love of Christ, An Hymn. The Rose of Sharon is my love, Sweet both in scent and show; The fairest lily I'll approve That in the vallies grow. My Christ is altogether fair, The chief of thousands ten; There's none with him that can compare Among the sons of men. More glorious than hills of prey Is Jesus, who for me Did a far richer ransom pay Than thousand worlds can be. The tongues and pens of men below, And angels all above, Cannot the thousandth part forth show Of my Redeemer's love. No hyperboles can be express'd, Nor no conception frame, Can any mortal in the least, To celebrate his fame. Yet I will sing my Jesus' praise, Tho' in a lisping strain; In hopes the time will come to pass, I'll sing with notes more plain. O well may I say, Love is strong, And cannot quenched be, By all the waters that belong To rivers and the sea. And oh the heighth, depth, breadth and length Of Jesus' love to those, Who, by his own free grace and strength, With him by cov'nant close! As for its height; it was in heav'n Before the world was fram'd, When we were by the Father giv'n To him to be redeem'd: Its depth brought him to earth below, To hell, and to the grave; For he God's wrath did undergo, Our souls from hell to save. Its breadth extends from sea to sea, To all the human race; All Adam's sons will welcome be, By faith that him embrace; Yea from, and to, eternity Its length is without change: For whom he loves, he loves for ay: Is not his love most strange? O if I were beyond the skies His glory to behold, I'd ravish'd be with extasies That here I could not hold. There numbers numberless surround His glorious throne above, All bent his praises forth to sound In songs of divine love. No toil there is them to molest, Nor ought like weariness; No night is there, nor need they rest; Their songs they never cease. With expectation I will wait Till that bless'd time shall come; When my dear Lord shall me invite Unto his presence home. An Hymn on Death. For certain, Lord, one day I must Fall by the hand of death, And turn to my origin dust, And yield to thee my breath. But how uncertain is the time When death shall call on me? It may be in my strength and prime; Whene'er it pleaseth thee. My times are wholly in thine hand, My being is from thee; Thou art my sov'reign to command, I must submissive be. Lord, grant me grace now to prepare For that last enemy, That I may be a conqueror Through him that loved me. Lord, take away the sting of death, Which is the guilt of sin, That when I must resign my breath, With Jesus I may reign. O Jesus, blessed be his name To all eternity, Who came to seek, save and redeem Poor sinful worms like me! How dreadful is approaching death, Where sin's unpardoned! The prospect of eternal wrath Ten thousand deaths exceed: But death unsting'd is a most sweet Ambassador of peace, That makes our joys to be complete, And all our sorrows cease. Lord, fill my soul with ev'ry grace; O give me faith and love, Repentance, self-denial, peace! O set my thoughts above! Prepare me, Lord, for death; that I, When passing death's dark vale, By faith on Jesus may rely, And neither faint nor fail. Hymn for a Fellowship Meeting. Say, brethren, wherefore are we met? What is our errand here? Is it some stories to relate, To gratify the ear? Yes; 'tis to talk of stories true, Of what was done of old, What sacred records to us shew, And us our teachers told. Here is a story wond'rous strange, And yet it is most true, That one should happiness exchange For mis'ries to ensue: Yet this exactly was the case Of God's eternal son; He put himself in sinner's place, And left his glorious throne, Rather than sinners perish'd all, As they behov'd to do; In consequence of Adam's fall, Hell-torments were their due. He condescended to come down, Our nature did assume, To pacify his Father's frown; He suff'red in our room. No friend like to a friend in need; And such a friend was he, That for our sins spilt his heart's blood Upon the cursed tree. Our griefs and sorrows he did bear, And by his stripes we're heal'd: Yet we not friends, but en'mies were, That 'gainst his laws rebell'd. To us the name of Jesus shews (When mis'ry we were in) The greatest and the best of news, Salvation for our sin: Not only from the pow'r and guilt Of sin he makes us free; But us he highly doth exalt To heav'n with him to be. O could we feel the influence, Of this transcendent love! 'Twould conquer self, make us intense For things that are above. THE CHILD's COMPANION; IN A NATURAL DIALOGUE BETWIXT A Child and One of riper Years: Useful for Young Ones. To my young Reader. Dear child, pray hearken unto me, And these few verses hear; For in them you will shortly see How you the Lord should fear. Remember thy Creator great, While in your youth and prime, While evils come not; lest too late You mourn the loss of time. These, and such like, are better far To store your memory, Than smutty idle stories are, That now too common be. ALEX. NICOL. An Advice to Children. By another Hand. O children dear, incline your ear, And hearken to God's voice: This counsel take, and that will make Your parents to rejoice. Be not like those that grace oppose, And give their minds to play: But let thy mind be well inclin'd In seeking wisdom's way. Then shalt thou rest with saints most bless'd, To all eternity; And have the crown of bless'd renown, God's name to magnify. That thou with Christ in paradise For evermore mayst dwell, This do thou pray both night and day: So children dear, farewell. The CHILD's COMPANION, &amp;c. CHILD. I pray, Sir, give me leave to ask Some things I cannot know; And be so kind, if that you can, All these unto me show. COMPANION. Say on, my child; I'll venture on the task; I love it well to hear young children ask. CHILD. How came this world at first to be? Or, who could reach so far, As to fix up these heavens above, The sun, moon, and each star? Who made the mountains and the hills, The rivers and the sea? And whereof can all things be made That round about us be? Sure, they have been exceeding strong, And also very high, That could perform so great a work, And reach up to the sky. And whereupon are all things set? How can they be upborn? How runs the sun till it go down? And how does it return? Yet, tho' they were strong men and high, That all these things have made; How came they at the first to be? Sure, they beginning had. COMP. My dearest child, those questions you propound Such in your age to ask are rarely found: And I am glad to solve you as I can, In plainest terms, that you may understand. There is a God who made all things of nought; Which may indeed non-plus your tender thought: But this great God no man can comprehend, Who was, and is, and will be without end. He of his goodness, by his word, made known To us, that he these mighty works hath done: That book we call the Bible is his word, In which we have a very true record Of all things needful for us here to know; And 'twill an answer to your questions show. There he declares, when he but spoke, and said, âLet all things be,â then all things Being had; And that it was his sacred will to take Six days exactly every thing to make; Such is his great Almighty Power, that he Of nothing made all round us that we see: Sun, moon and stars, he gave command to know Their nat'ral courses, how and where to go: And as you wonder whereon all things stand, My dearest child, you ought to understand, That the same pow'r, who gave them Beings all, Supports and holds them that they cannot fall. CHILD. Oh wonderful! but God is great! But yet how can it be, That no beginning he has had? Seems very strange to me. COMP. No wonder, tho' this seem most strange to thee; For nat'ral men could ne'er that myst'ry see: Philosophers, with all their nat'ral light, Could ne'er conceive the world's beginning right; Neither did their conjectures well agree, For none can know't but by divinity. Some thought that all things, at beginning, were From earth itself; and other some from air; And some from simples, some compounds, would have All things at first; some, numbers did conceive To be the first beginning of creation; And some from atoms fetch their generation, And some from fire; others the world to be In its duration from eternity. But God himself hath by his word made known That He's the great Original alone: Let this suffice us, since to search him more Unlawful is; but let us him adore; For if we trace him farther than he hath Reveal'd himself, and wrought in us by faith, We lose ourselves in that abyss of thought, And our ideas dwindle down to nought. Let us admire and still adore what we Can never comprehend, nor fully see; And so believe what he to us doth show: And after death we more of him shall know. CHILD. What means your saying, After death We more of him shall know? Can we have knowledge after death, When unto dust we go? COMP. But, my dear child, altho' our bodies may Go to the grave, and into dust decay; Yet we have all souls, that can never die Thro' all the ages of eternity. CHILD. What is the soul? what is its shape? From whence did it proceed? Where goes it when our bodies die, For ever to abide? COMP. My child, our souls by God created were, And came from him into our bodies here: Its form and shape no mortal man can tell; But, when we die, it goes to heav'n or hell. CHILD. Where are those places, heav'n and hell, To which, you say, they go? Or is there in them light and joy, Or darkness, grief and wo? COMP. Heav'n is above, and far beyond the sky; Light shines in it, and joy eternally: Hell is beneath, in the profoundest deep; And all in it with torment groan and weep. CHILD. What causes joy in heav'n to be? Or what in hell gives pain? Or why do souls chuse to go there? Or, when there, to remain? COMP. In heav'n all pure, untainted pleasures are; For God himself, the chiefest good, is there: There is his throne which angels bright surround, With golden harps his praises still they sound; There the redeem'd are made both priests and kings, And still the praise of their Redeemer sings, All shining as so many stars of light: Nor have they any intervals of night; Of sun nor moon to shine they have no need, For from God's glory all their light proceed, That far surpass ten thousand times our day, When Sol shines bright in his meridian ray: There all that can immortal souls solace Is to be found in that most blessed place; A thousand years is there scarce thought a day, Such happiness God doth in it display. But lo! in hell, Satan and his black crew Their dreadful groans with torments still renew: With them the souls of unbelievers go Down to that place of never-ending woe; There, press'd with loads of divine wrath, they ly, For ever dying, yet can never die: There horror, darkness, and all mischief meet, To make the miseries of the damn'd compleat: No way is left how they in peace may be; For death still meets them wheresoe'er they flee. CHILD. Who are they that believers are? And angels, who are they? And their Redeemer, who is he That's praised as you say? And who is Satan and his crew? I pray you to me tell Who unbelievers are, and damn'd, That have their part in hell? COMP. Believers are those that believ'd the truth Of their Redeemer from God's sacred mouth, Which is reveal'd in his most holy Word, That by his grace we have upon record. Angels are these bless'd spirits that were made To serve God e're this world beginning had. To tell you who the great Redeemer is, That brings his people to that place of bliss; He's the eternal son of God, and he Became a man, and for their sins did die. Satan, as said is, and his cursed crew, Were angels that thought heaven to subdue. Satan himself the highest angel was Of all so many chiefest and most fair; Ambitious pride he entertain'd, whereby He thought at last to equal the Most High; Drew many thousands of inferior rank To join with him in this rebellious prank: But the Almighty soon perceiv'd their aim, And down to hell in fury tumbled them. The unbelievers and the damn'd are one And the same people that to hell is gone, Because they slighted mercy in their day, And unto God would not for mercy pray. CHILD. But pray, Sir, tell me, if you can, If these men did rebel Against the Lord, in Satan's plot, That they are sent to hell; And why are some, as you have said, From that dire place redeem'd, While those who once were angels, yet By God are not esteem'd? COMP. Man was not made when Satan did rebel, And for his trespass was turn'd down to hell; But afterwards God made the human race, On purpose to fill up their empty space. But to describe the story of man's fall Will take long time: but yet, my child, I shall, To satisfy you so far as I can. And so, at first, God made one single man, Both soul and body, like to you and me, And will'd him to increase and multiply; And for that end God made a woman fair, And gave to him: and bad them have a care To keep the laws that he prescrib'd to them; And if they did continue without blame, After sometime he would translate them from That place, and bring them unto heaven home. âBut if (said he) you do what I forbid, âI'll punish you as I the angels did: âFree will they had to stand or fall; and lo, âSatan soon wrought their dismal overthrow.â But God's great goodness and free sov'reign choice Saves some from hell to heav'n's eternal joys: The angels sin'd, without temptation, sure, And must for ever punishment endure; But man was tempted; yet 'tis God's free grace That ever sav'd one of the human race. CHILD. Pray be not angry, and I'll beg One favour more of you; That is, the way how we are sav'd More plainly to me shew. COMP. My child, I shall before I go An answer to your question show, And plain, but briefly as I can, Describe God's covenants with man. When man at first, as I have said, Was by his great Creator made, He plac'd him in a garden fair, Where he had all things necessar' To make him happy in this life, Except it was one thingâa wife. For when the creatures of each kind Were brought to him, he could not find, Among them all, a social mate To suit his nature and estate: Wherefore the great Creator made, Him soundly sleep, as he'd been dead, And took a rib out of his side, Whereof he made a lovely bride: An helper meet, a woman fair, And brought her unto Adam there. Then Adam said, âThis is my bone, My flesh and blood, we both are one: Hence let all men that come to life Leave all their friends, and take a wife.â Then said the great Creator, âLo, I've made you happy persons two: I give you pow'r; you I command To multiply, and fill the land: I give you sovereignty O'er all things in the earth and sea; Only one thing I want of you, And that is a superior's due, Whate'er my will is to command, You'll not rebelliously gainstand: Wherefore I give you leave to eat Of all this garden's fruits for meat; Only one tree I do design To keep, because the right is mine; Wherefore if you shall eat the same, I here do solemnly proclaim You and your whole posterity Shall for the same for ever die: Therefore free-will I give you here, Either to eat or to forbear; Still to retain your innocence, Or show your disobedience; Thereby t'incur my wrath for ever, From which none else can thee deliver. Chuse what you think is best; and so In happiness I leave you two.â Thus when the great Creator had This covenant with Adam made, Adam consented thereuntil, And promis'd to obey his will: When God had giv'n them good advice, He left them both in paradise. But Satan, as I said before, Who still doth like a lion roar, Ay seeking whom he may devour, Envying the lovely happy pair, Straight to seduce them did prepare: The serpent was a subtil beast By nature; and he thought it best Therein to enter, that he might Thereby at first seduce their sight, And gain upon their outward sense, To violate their innocence. So when the woman did repair Near by the tree, to take the air; Satan, in shape of serpent, came, And up the tree straightway he clamb; Pluck'd off the fruit, began to eat, And said, âThis is delicious meat.â The woman, wond'ring all the time, Supposing that it was a crime He had committed, said, âBase elf! How can you thus destroy yourself? Sure you and your posterity Must for this crime for ever die Our great Creator said we should Be free to eat all that we would, Excepting this one single tree, Which by his great supreme decree He hath forbid, on penalty That if we eat thereof, we die.â Then Satan said, âGreat noble queen, You with your eyes have fairly seen How that I, who inferior are, Below your nature very far, Am free to eat whate'er I please, Without ought to molest my ease; Then why should you be thus confin'd, More than the brute inferior kind?â The woman said, âI cannot say, But freely we ought to obey Our sovereign great Creator, who All good things on us doth destow.â Then Satan said, âI grant, 'tis true Obedience is a sovereign's due, As we the creatures yield to you: But your Creator doth impose On you, and leads you by the nose; For well he knows if you should eat This fruit, you would be wise and great; For see, great queen of the creation, What great and sudden alteration That fruit hath wrought on me a brute, Who all my life before was mute: Now I by virtue of this choice, Can speak, you see, with human voice. Now what great influence, think ye, Would it not have on such as thee? I can assure you from the sense I have of my experience, It would make you as gods to know Both good and evil, and would show What politics your Maker did Intend when he did you forbid.â With these, and such like flatt'ring tales He on her innocence prevails: So that she said, âMine eyes, behold The fruit looks beautiful as gold; Yea, since it hath so chang'd this beast, I'll try its virtue and its taste.â With that she pluck'd and eat also; Straight to her husband she did go, Gave him thereof; so likewise he Did eat of that forbidden tree. No sooner had they broke this law, Than they themselves both naked saw; And were asham'd when they did hear The voice of God did reach their ear; And hid themselves among the boughs, For fear that he would them accuse: For he who knows all that is done Above, yea and below the sun, He knew it instantly, that they Had from his precepts gone astray. So, coming to the garden, he Cry'd, âAdam, Adam, where are ye?â But when they heard the voice of God Reach to the place of their abode, A terror seiz'd their guilty hearts, And like two hares affrighted starts Up from the covert where they lay, Their great Creator to obey. When he call'd, âAdam, where art thou?â Poor Adam did before him bow, All prostrate on the ground; and said, I'm naked, Lord, and was afraid, When I thy dreadful voice did hear, Before thy presence to appear.â The great Creator said, âWho told Thee thou art naked? Wast thou bold To take and eat of that one tree Which I at first deny'd to thee?â Then Adam said, âThe woman, who Thou gav'st to me, did from me go, And took and eat, and to me gave, Which I confess I did receive.â The Lord God said unto the woman, âHad'st thou not all the fruits in common? Why didst thou touch or taste this tree?â Said she, âThe serpent cheated me.â Th'Almighty to the serpent said, âBecause thou hast man thus betray'd, Above all creatures thou art curs'd, And all thy life eat nought but dust; Upon thy belly thou shalt go, For a perpetual mark of wo; Betwixt the woman's seed and thee I'll put a lasting enmity; Thy head it shall his bruises feel, But thou indeed shalt bruise his heel.â Unto the woman next he said, âThy sorrows shall be multiply'd In thy conception, and in birth With sorrow shalt thou still bring forth; And thy desire shall always be Towards thy husband ruling thee.â Then unto Adam did he say, âBecause thy wife you did obey, The ground is cursed for thy sake; Henceforth it shall be poor and weak, Its strength to thee it shall not yield, And thou shalt eat herbs of the field; With sorrow, toil, and sweat of face Thy daily bread thou shalt purchase, Till thou return again to dust, From whence thou taken wast at first.â Yet notwithstanding of their sin, The Lord God made them coats of skin, And clothed them; but drove them from Sweet paradise, their native home; And cherubims he plac'd to wait The entry of the garden gate, And a great flaming sword, that went Each way, their access to prevent Towards the tree of life, lest they Should eat thereof, and live alway. Thus they, and their posterity, Involved were in misery; Depriv'd the presence of their God, And left to range the world abroad, Not knowing where or how to live; And beasts, that did obedience give To them before, rebelled now, And man as prey they would pursue; The lion, tyger, wolf and boar Them greedily they would devour. Besides corruption seiz'd them so, And did like poison thro' them go, Still rip'ning on apace, till they Return'd to their origin, clay. But Adam he some comfort had, From what his great Creator said When he the serpent did accuse, To wit, that woman's seed should bruise The serpent's head, and man should feel The serpent's bruises in his heel. Thus Adam by reflection knew That God to them would mercy shew; For God, by secret inspiration, Gave him an ample revelation Of all things afterwards should be Concerning his posterity: By this he came to apprehend That myst'ry none can comprehend. That there's one God, yet persons three In that same very Godhead be, To wit, the Father and the Son And Holy Ghost, yet all in one. That God was from eternity, And will the same for ever be; That he is present every where, And sees at once all things that are; That he's infinite in his pow'r, The Maker, and the Governor Of all and ev'ry thing that be, Above, below, heav'n, earth and sea, His works and providence declare; All's attributes infinite are: His wisdom, pow'r and holiness, And justice, truth and great goodness; These divine attributes he saw Implead each other, as at law: Each advocate his client's right Did vindicate with all his might. For Justice, he insisted on The truth of God, and it alone. âSince God hath said, who cannot lie, If man shall sin, then shall he die; Now man hath sinn'd, then let him go To hell t'endure eternal wo.â Then Goodness said, âCan mercy now Bring no relief man to rescue? Must he and his posterity All in hell's flames for ever ly?â Said Holiness, âI do abhor All Sin, and therefore can no more Admit of mankind in my sight, Since he my holy laws did slight.â Wisdom, who heard them all the while, Did with compassion sweetly smile; Said, âJustice must be satisfied, And Holiness too dignified, The sinner sav'd, and man set free From hell and endless misery.â This did astonish the creation, To hear such news of consolation: But how it could be brought about No finite being could find out. Thus Adam he was made to see, That God, from all eternity, Foresaw man's fall, and its effect; And that he certain did elect, And chus'd to be redeem'd from wrath, And effects of the second death. The great and glorious Trinity, As they are One, did all agree: The Father, he did condescend Into the world his Son to send In form and nature of a man, Because that Justice did demand The nature that hath sinn'd must die, The truth of God to verify. The Son consented thereunto, In all things he would have him do: Thus was the covenant agreed Betwixt them, and determined. The Father promis'd to the Son Support till all his work was done: The Son, upon the other part, Engag'd from's glory to depart, Become a man, and suffer all Due to the elect by the fall. So some in ev'ry generation Of this had clearer revelation, Until th'appointed time drew near, That Christ the Son was to appear. CHILD. That in the Godhead there should be Three persons, yet but one, Seems very wonderful to me. And hard to think upon. COMP. My dearest child, as I have said before, This is a myst'ry wherein none should pore. We must believe what in his word he shows; For there's no creature this great myst'ry knows: The persons of the glorious Trinity Were Three in One from all eternity. The Father's pers'nal property alone Is that he only doth beget the Son; The Son's to be begotten of the Father; The Holy Ghost is to descend from either: And, in that wond'rous method of salvation, Each of the Three stands in their own relation; For God the Father did contrive the way Of man's salvation, Wisdom to display; The Son did purchas't at th'expence and loss Of his own blood and life upon the cross; The Holy Ghost applies the same to those Whom God from all eternity had chose. CHILD. God, as you say, who sees all things Past, present and to come, Knew those that would do good or ill, That made him chuse but some. COMP. No, it was neither foreseen good nor ill Of any one that moved him theretill, But his own free and gracious sov'reign will: For ever since the first man Adam fell, All men are guilty, and so heirs of hell; Guilty so soon as to the world we come; And therefore not the foreseen good of some; For no man lives and sinneth not: and ev'n The best of men cannot lay claim to heav'n; For none are sav'd but by free sov'reign grace, And who by faith do Jesus Christ embrace. CHILD. Why may not all believe and him embrace, And so all sav'd, as you have said, by grace? COMP. None can believe so as to go to heav'n, But those to whom the grace of faith is giv'n. Though God requires of us that we believe, And for our sins that we repent and grieve, Those are conditions on our part, if we Unto God's covenant of grace agree; Yet wrought in us by God's most holy Spirit, Abstracting from our own desert or merit; Yea he works in us both to will and do Of his good pleasure, and renews us too In ev'ry part, and turns our hearts from evil, And frees us from the bondage of the devil, From sin, and from our own corruptions all, When he doth us effectually call. CHILD. What you have said, Sir, I approve; And I admire God's grace and love In saving some, as you have said, That no good thing about them had. But tell me, Sir, doth't not appear That God is some way too severe, In making creatures some to be Doom'd to eternal misery? COMP. God is supreme; âNone can, or yet dare say, Unto him, Why or what dost thou? or stay His hand from working; when, or where he pleases, He puts down one, another up he raises.â Since ev'ry man from Adam did descend, All are partakers of that sin he sinn'd: He was our head and representative; As he behav'd we were to die or live; For if the fountain be corrupt, be sure The streams thereof they never can be pure. If he in innocence had persever'd, We of that happiness had also shar'd: Most just 'tis then, since he has sinn'd, that we Should be partakers of the misery. CHILD. But, Sir, I have some scruple yet, With rev'rence: I suppose That God is wond'rous good to all He for his elect chose: But still something appears to me That's cruel and unkind, Concerning these poor miscreants That he hath left behind: Can love and goodness pleasure take Those creatures to torment, For ever to eternity, And not at all relent? COMP. Though God is good and merciful, yet he Is also just; and therefore cannot be Said to be cruel, though he never had Sav'd one of all the human race he made. Crimes in proportion punish'd are as they Committed are 'gainst great or lesser sway; So man sinn'd 'gainst Infinite Majesty, And must be punish'd too infinitely: Besides, if sinners should for ever live, Still they would sin, and God's good Spirit grieve; And ev'n in hell they curse, blaspheme and roar Against that God whom saints in heav'n adore; Most just it is they should for ever ly In hell, and suffer to eternity. CHILD. But why might not Almighty God, By his infinite pow'r, Establish man, when he was made, From sin and death secure? COMP. Because 'twas not according to his will; For what he pleases that he does fulfil: Besides, his glorious attributes had not Been so display'd, nor he such praise had got. CHILD. But ah! methinks the curses he Shall get by those in hell, Will counter-balance all the praise By these in heav'n that dwell. COMP. Child, you mistake it: tho' the damn'd in hell Shall howl, and cry, curse, roar, blaspheme, and yell; Yet they can blame none but themselves for all The miseries that ever them befal. CHILD. Dear Sir, I pray make this appear; For that's the thing I long to hear. COMP. Child, read the scriptures, and you'll find Enough to satisfy your mind: There you will see, since Adam fell, God had a church on earth to dwell; And all that would come in were free, Tho' sinners ne'er so great they be. Abel was humble, wise and good; But Cain vicious was and rude; Instead of joining with his brother, He slew him, and his blood did smother; So that he was without excuse, When God to punish him did chuse: Enoch he walk'd with God, and did The wickedness of men forbid; And did emit a prophecy, That they for sin should judged be; Yet they no warning took, and so Without excuse to hell did go. Noah again, when wickedness Grew rampant, preached righteousness Six score of years, and warned all A flood upon them was to fall; Yet they no warning took, till they Were by the deluge swept away. Next Abraham, he did not chuse, When God did call him, to refuse; But when God call'd him, forth he went, Not knowing where to pitch his tent; Submissive unto God's command, He sojourn'd in a foreign land; While those he left behind did chuse Their old idolatry to use: So that excuse they could have none, When they by God were overthrown. Lot, vex'd in Sodom ev'ry day, Did often them beseech and pray To leave the place, repent and turn, Before God did their city burn: But yet no argument could gain On them, to make them sin refrain; Till by experience they found Themselves by fire and brimstone drown'd. Isaac in midst of heathens led A pious life; and all he had Was bless'd therefore with good success, That all around him might confess, That if they had led such a life, As honest Isaac and his wife, For ever happy they had been; But no excuse they had to screen Them from the punishment of sin, Since they in no ways would come in. When Jacob was oblig'd to fly From wicked Esan's tyranny, God so remarkably him bless'd, That Laban he himself confess'd, That while he lodging there did take, He found God bless'd him for his sake: So that when men of common sense Could learn this by experience, And yet would not religious be, Without excuse be sure they'll see God's righteous judgments on them fall, Who would not hearken to his call. Esau had opportunity A devout holy man to be; Good education and example, Altho' he on the same did trample, Both from his father and his mother, And also from his younger brother: But all for nought, it was in vain, He turned graceless and profane, Despis'd his birth-right, good refus'd, So that he cannot be excus'd. Joseph was tempt'd to be unjust, To satisfy his mistress' lust; Yet would he not yield thereunto, For all that she could say or do: So, when she could not gain her end, Revenge on him she did intend. There is no doubt this good man had The ill of sin before her laid; So that she no excuse can frame, Altho' she fry in endless flame. Moses was sent by God's command To Pharoah king of Egypt's land, To fetch his people thence, that they Might serve their God and him obey: But the hard-hearted tyrant slew Their males, and did no mercy shew; And when that Moses him besought, And many signs and wonders wrought, Pharoah, still hard'ned, still denied, Until all the first born died; And tho' he was convinc'd that all The judgments that on him did fall Were purely God's Almighty hand, Yet his good-will he did withstand; So he none but himself can blame, Tho' he's condemned to endless flame. And many more examples be That in the scriptures you may see, That God is good, and just, and holy, And men themselves to blame are wholly. CHILD. But one thing, Sir, before you go You'll be so kind as to me show; And that is, what religion I Shall chuse, and also which deny. COMP. My child, religions there's no more In all the universe but four; And that's Mahomet', Pagan, Jew, And Christian lastly; that's for you: For there's no name in earth or heav'n, Nor yet among men, that is giv'n, By which we can be sav'd, 'tis plain, But Christ, who died and rose again; And him hath God exalted high A Prince and Saviour to be, To give repentance and remission Of all our sins for our salvation. CHILD. No Pagan, Jew, nor Mahomet', Is to be seen upon our street; Yet there, on Sunday, when I stand, The people flock on ev'ry hand To diff'rent quarters of the town, To their respective meetings bound. To follow which I do not know; I pray you therefore to me show Which of them all I ought to chuse, And which of them I should refuse. COMP. What makes such diff'rence in communion Is that old wretched word Opinion, Hatch'd sure by corrupt men's invention, That bred great trouble and contention: Opinion makes a man suppose That he all others should oppose, And that no man is safe but he That is of his community: Such is the folly of mankind, Where prejudice hoodwinks the mind. But be thou, child, advis'd by me, From party-prejudice keep free; Believe in Christ, and him alone Take for your whole salvation. Pray unto God, that he would make You know the truth for Jesus' sake; Pray for repentance, faith and love, And all the graces from above; Observe and keep God's holy law, And of his threat'nings stand in awe; Believe his promises, and he Will surely make them good to thee; A narrow watch keep o'er your heart, And from appearing ills depart, Especially whate'er you see Against God's holy laws to be; And strive to keep a conscience To God and man void of offence; Read ev'ry day God's word with care, You'll find your duties fully there. And since it must be so that ye Must join with some community, Join those whose tenets are most pure, According to God's word, be sure; Neglect their errors which you see By scripture light, and then you'll be A Christian, not a party pleader: May God himself still be your leader! And so, my child, I bid adieu, Till the next time I meet with you. KING SOLOMON's BOOK OF ECCLESIASTES, IN METRE. In this book he convinceth of the vanity of the world, and the foolishness of men: He shews that there is nothing better than to fear God, and to keep his commandments: and he maintains, that there shall be a future judgment. He wrote this book after his falling from God, in token of his true repentance. Virtues are several paths which lead to heaven; And they who tread those paths have graces given: Repentant tears allay the dust of pride, And pious sighs do blow vain thoughts aside. On the BOOK. King Solomon here, in this book, doth shew What by experience he fully knew: Well might he say, That all was vanity; He found it so in truth and verity. For having riches, pow'r and wisdom too, T'accomplish what he had a mind to do, He gave free scope to all his appetites, And try'd all manner of this world's delights; Till drown'd in pleasures, he forgot his God, Who with his bounty did him so much load, That none more rich, and none more wise, than he, Yet all employ'd pursuing vanity. But God by grace at last did let him see, That all he sought was empty vanity; That all amusements, pleasures, and each thing Could here be found, behind them leave a sting; And but short liv'd at longest he did find, And as uncertain as the fleeting wind; And that, for these short vanities, he must In a short time return again to dust, His soul to God, to get a sentence due, And lasting doom for all he did pursue. Reflecting thus, he did repent and grieve, And pray'd that God would his sad state relieve, Renounc'd each carnal and each vain delight, And set himself this little book to write, That others might escape these rocks whereon He split himself, when he was dead and gone. ALEX. NICOL. Collace, March 6th 1749. King Solomon's Book of Ecclesiastes, in Verse. CHAP. I. [1] These words the preacher, David's son and heir, When king in Salem, wisely did declare. 2 Vanity of vanities, said he, Behold all is nought else but vanity. 3 What profit can a man propose to have Of all his labour on this side the grave? 4 One generation passeth hence away, Another comes; but still the earth doth stay. 5 The sun ariseth, also downward goes, And hastes to where he at the first arose. 6 The wind it goes toward the South, and then It turns about unto the North again: Continually it whirls in circuits round, And knows no limits, nor restraint of bound. 7 All rivers run into the sea, yet we No fuller can perceive the same to be: From whence the rivers at the first do flow, Thither again they nat'rally do go. 8 All things we see are full of labour; so Man cannot utter, or their labour know: The eye is not with seeing satisfied, Nor yet the ear with hearing ever tir'd. 9 The thing that's been, is that which yet shall be; And what is done, we done again may see: And there is nothing any man can shew, Below the sun that can be called New. 10 Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See this is new, and never being had? Yea, it hath been long time before us sure, When our hid substance lay in earth obscure. 11 There's no remembrance of what's past and gone, Nor after-ages mind what we have done. 12 Now I the preacher was in Salem king, And over Israel with power did reign. 13 I gave myself by wisdom to search out All things done under heaven round about: This travel sore God gives the sons of men, Therewith to exercise themselves in pain. 14 Yea I have seen all works below the sun; And lo, they all are vanity when done. 15 That which is crooked straight we cannot see, And what is wanting cannot numb'red be. 16 With mine own heart I commun'd as I sate: Lo, now, thought I, I'm come to great estate: I've got more wisdom, sure, than all of them That were before me in Jerusalem: Of wisdom I had great experience, And I for knowledge us'd great diligence. 17 Wisdom to know I gave myself once wholly: Also to know what madness was and folly: And I perceiv'd nothing but grief of spirit A man by these can any ways inherit: 18 For in much wisdom is much grief; and he That gets much knowledge, many sorrows see. CHAP. II. [1] I bade my heart prove mirth and pleasure; they I also found but empty vanity. 2 I said of laughter, Surely it is madness; And what does mirth but fills the mind with sadness? 3 With wine I sought to chear my heart; but, when I thought on wisdom, this was also vain: Folly I try'd, to see what's good for men To do on earth while they alive remain. 4 Great works I made, and built me houses great, And planted vineyards at a costly rate: 5 Gardens I made, and orchards to my mind, And fruit trees planted therein of each kind: 6 I made me pools for wat'ring nurseries, That bringeth forth the young and tender trees: 7 I got me servants, yea, and maidens fair, And in my house too servants born were: I had great store of cattle great and small, Exceeding far my predecessors all: 8 I gath'red silver, gold, and ev'ry thing That proper were for princes or a king: I got me singers and delightful sports, With instrumental music of all sorts. 9 So I was great, increas'd above all them That were before me in Jerusalem; Also my wisdom did with me remain. 10 Mine eyes desire I never did restrain; I ne'er withheld my heart from any joys, And in my labours greatly did rejoice: This was the portion of my labours all, That unto me of all these did befal: 11 I look'd on all the works my hands had wrought, And on the labours my inventions sought; And lo, I found them trifling vanity, And sore vexation of my soul to be: There was no profit in ought I had done, Nor satisfaction here below the sun. 12 I turn'd myself sage wisdom to behold; With madness too, and folly, I made bold: What can the man do that comes after me? Ev'n what is done, surely no more can he. 13 Then did I see that wisdom did excel Folly, as far as heaven itself does hell. 14 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but lo, The fool in paths of darkness on doth go: And I myself perceiv'd, that unto all One event still, for the most part, doth fall. 15 Then did I say, Why should I wiser be Than is the fool? for now I plainly see One event happ'neth both to him and me; Then said I thereby this is vanity. 16 For there's no more remembrance of the wise Than of the fool: in death all hidden lyes: That which is now shall all forgotten be; And as the fool, doth not the wise man, die? 17 Therefore I even hated life, because The work I did unto me grievous was: For surely all is empty vanity, And sore vexation of the spirit be. 18 I hated all the labours I had done, And my inventions here below the sun; Because that he who shall come after me Shall in short time thereof possessor be. 19 And who knows whether he'll be wise or fool? Yet he o'er all my labours shall have rule, Wherein I labour'd, and my wisdom shown: This is a vanity below the sun. 20 Then did I seek to cause my heart despair Of all the works whereof my heart took care. 21 For there's a man hath wisdom to invent, And knowledge to work out his whole intent; In equity he deals with all mankind: Yet must he leave his labours all behind, Unto a man that ne'er employ'd a thought T'accomplish them, nor therein ever wrought: This surely is a sordid vanity, And also a great evil certainly. 22 For what hath man of all his labours done, And heart's vexation here below the sun? 23 For all his days are sorrows, travel, grief; Yea, all he doth can yield him no relief. When as at night his heart can take no rest: This is a vanity, and not the least. 24 There's nothing better for a man, I think, Than that he should with pleasure eat and drink; And let his soul enjoy the happiness Of all he does, and all he doth possess: But this I saw to mortals certainly Came from the lib'ral hand of the Most High. 25 For who can eat, his soul to satisfy, Or who can hasten thereto more than I? 26 For God gives still to good men in his sight Wisdom and knowledge, joy and heart's delight: But to the wicked travel, toil and pain, God gives, that they may wealth and riches gain, That he may give't to good men in his sight. This is a vain vexation of the sp'rit. CHAP. III. [1] To ev'ry thing a season is assign'd, Time to each purpose under heav'n design'd: 2 Time to be born, and eke a time to die; A time to plant, and time to pluck there be: 3 A time to kill, a time to heal; also A time to build, a time to overthrow: 4 A time to weep, a time to laugh may chance; A time to mourn, a time also to dance: 5 A time there is to gather stones full fast, A time also the same away to cast; Time to embrace another, time again When from embracing we must needs refrain: 6 A time to get, a time to lose; there may Be time to keep, and time to cast away: 7 A time to rent, a time to sew; and eke A time of silence, and a time to speak: 8 A time to love, a time to hate may be; A time of war, a time of peace, we see. 9 What profit hath his labours to him brought, Wherein he oft so eagerly hath wrought? 10 I've seen the travel God hath given to men, To exercise them constantly therein: 11 He in his time made all things beautiful, And in their heart he makes the world to rule: So that no man the work of God can find Out from beginning thereof to the end. 12 In them I know there is no good to choice, Save man through life do good, and so rejoice: 13 And that each man should eat, drink, and enjoy The good of all wherein he doth employ His hands or mind at home, or yet abroad; And this for certain is the gift of God. 14 Whate'er God doth, I know for certainty Shall be for ever to eternity: Nought thereto can be added, neither can Ought therefrom be diminished by man: And what God doth, he doth it that men may Fear constantly before him night and day. 15 What's been, is now; and that which is to be, Hath been; and God requires what's past we see. 16 Yea, and I saw below the sun the place Of judgment just, that there was wickedness: Who to the place of righteousness repair, Will shortly see iniquity is there. 17 I in my heart said, God shall surely be Judge both of good and bad of all degree: For there's a time for ev'ry work assign'd, And for each purpose by our God ordain'd. 18 I in my heart perceiv'd the state of men, And wish'd that God might manifest them plain; And that they may perceive, and clearly see That they are beasts, and thereby humbled be. 19 For what befals the sons of men, likewise Befalleth beasts, and so alike both dies: They've all one breath; man hath no pre'm'nency Above a beast, for all is vanity. 20 Into one place all go, both beasts and men: For dust they are; to dust they turn again. 21 Who knows man's spirit that doth upward go; The sp'rits of beasts descend to earth below? 22 There's nothing better in this world, I see, Than that a man rejoice and merry be In his own works; for that's his portion sure: What follows him there's none can him assure. CHAP. IV. [1] So I return'd, consider'd all oppressions Done here below, which are beyond expressions: And lo, the tears of such oppressed ones, Without comforters, utter'd grievous groans; And on the side of their oppressors were Pow'r (but, poor souls!) they had no comforter. 2 Wherefore I prais'd the dead, already dead, Far more than he that liveth in his stead. 3 Yea better far is he that hath not been, Than dead and living; for he hath not seen The evil work that here below the sun By sons of men so frequently is done. 4 Again, all travel I considered, And each right-work, for which a man's envy'd Ev'n of his neighbour: this is vanity, And sore vexation of the mind, surely. 5 The fool together folds his hands afresh, And by his sloth he eateth his own flesh. 6 Better's an handful, with a quiet possession; Than both hands full, with travel and vexation. 7 Then on reflection I did plainly see Below the sun another vanity: 8 There's one alone, and there is not another; Yea, and he hath not either child or brother: Yet endless toil his carnal heart bewitches, So that he's never satisfied with riches; Neither saith he, For whom now do I save My riches, and my soul of good bereave? This also is a vanity; yea more, It is a travel, and a toil full sore. 9 Two better are than one, because they have A good reward for labour to receive. 10 For if they fall, the one will make a shift, And strive his fellow up again to lift: But wo to him that is alone when he Shall fall; hath none that will his helper be. 11 Again, if two together ly, anon They've heat; but how can one be warm alone? 12 And if one shall prevail against him, two Shall him withstand, and likely overthrow; A threefold cord will not so quickly break, As one that's single, certainly more weak. 13 A poor wise child is better far, than he That's old and foolish, tho' a king he be, Who to no admonition will agree. 14 From out of prison one may raised be To rule and reign in royal dignity. Whereas one born in his own kingdom may Be render'd poor, and subject-like obey. 15 I then consider'd all the living which Walk under heav'n, yea, both the poor and rich: The second child, when as a man is dead, That after him shall stand up in his stead. 16 There is no end of all the people seen Even of all before them that have been; Those that come after in him shall not joy. This also is a vexing vanity. CHAP. V. [1] When to God's house thou goest, then be sure To keep thy foot; and be more apt to hear, Than to present the sacrifice of fools, For they ne'er mind that they transgress his rules. 2 Be thou not rash nor hasty in thine heart, To let ought from thy sinful lips depart Before the Lord: for God's in heav'n, and thou Art on the earth; so let thy words be few. 3 A dream comes through a train of business, And fools are known by words too numerous. 4 When thou shalt vow a vow to God, take care To pay the same, and do not it defer: For he in fools no pleasure sure can take; Pay then thy vow, and venture not to break. 5 'Tis better far in vowing to delay, Than one should vow, and then neglect to pay. 6 Let not thy mouth entice thy flesh to sin, Nor angels see an error thou art in: Wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, And spoil the work wherein thou mayst rejoice? 7 In dreams and words are vanities right odd: But shun them all, and only fear thou God. 8 If thou the poor oppressed sore dost see, Though in a land judgment and justice be Most vi'lently perverted, think't not strange, For the Most High will recompence revenge. 9 All share the profits that the earth do yield; The king himself is served by the field. 10 He that loves silver to excess, shall see That he therewith shall ne'er contented be; Nor he that loves abundance with increase: This also is a vanity no less. 11 When goods increase, their eaters multiply; Their owner only sees them with his eye. 12 The lab'ring man most sweetly takes repose; No discontent in wealth or pen'ry knows: Whereas the fulness of the rich doth keep With anxious cares their drowsy eyes from sleep. 13 There's a sore evil I've seen here below, Riches kept for the owner's overthrow. 14 But these same riches, by mismanagement, For certain perish, and are quickly spent: His son, that after in his stead should stand, Is naked born with nothing in his hand. 15 As he at first came from his mother's womb, Just as he came, so he'll go to his tomb: Nought of his labours he can bear away When his dead corpse shall mingle with the clay. 16 This also is an evil sore, that he In all points goes as first he came to be. What profit hath he? what can please his mind, When he hath labour'd for the empty wind? 17 For all his days in darkness he shall eat, And have much sorrow, wrath, and sickness great. 18 Behold that which I heretofore have seen Is good and comely, and hath ever been, Ev'n that a man should eat, drink, and enjoy The good for which his hands he did employ All his life days, which here, below the sun, God gives to him; for 'tis his portion. 19 Each man to whom God gives abundant wealth, And pow'r to eat with competent good health, And takes his portion with a joyful heart; This is a gift God doth to him impart. 20 For he'll not much remember his life days; Because God grants him joy in all his ways. CHAP. VI. [1] There is an evil I have often seen Below the sun, that common is to men: 2 A man whom God gives honour wealth and ease, And wants for nothing that his heart might please; Yet God denies him pow'r to use the same; But strangers thereto right and title claim: This is a strange and sordid vanity; An ill disease, as in the world can be. 3 If one man should an hundred children have, And many days, yea many years, should live, And yet his soul be never fill'd with good, And have no burial, may be understood To be far worse than an untimely birth: 4 For he comes in with vanity, and forth Again in darkness he departs away; And fame his name doth in oblivion lay. 5 Moreover he hath never seen the sun, Nor any thing at all hath ever known: This hath more rest in dark oblivion's shade, Than th'other ever in his lifetime had. 6 Yea, tho' he live a thousand years twice told, Yet with his eyes did never good behold: Do not all mortals to one place descend? What's made of dust, in dust again must end. 7 Man's labour all is for his mouth; yet he His appetite can never satisfy. 8 What hath the wise more than the fool? what hath The poor that walk within the living's path? 9 The eye sight's better, tho' it soon expire Than is the wand'ring of the soul's desire: This also is a very vanity, And a vexation of the mind, surely. 10 That which hath been it is already nam'd, 'Tis known that man was by the Highest fram'd: Therefore he may not once with him contend; For he in no ways can himself defend. 11 Since many things do increase vanity, What can a man be bettered thereby? 12 For who is he can tell what's good for man In this frail life, all his life days so vain, Which as a shadow he doth spend away? For who is he can tell a man what may Be after him, when he is dead and gone, Into his stead here underneath the sun? CHAP. VII. [1] A good name is more preferable far Than precious ointments, ne'er so costly, are: So is the day wherein we come to die To be preferr'd to our nativity. 2 The house of mourning, better far go there, Than to the house of feasting to repair: For that's the end of all men, when they part; Yea, and the living lays it to his heart. 3 Grief better is than laughter certainly; For oft the heart is bettered thereby. 4 The wise man's heart the mourners house frequent; But fools with mirth are always well content. 5 Better to hear the wise rebukes and rules, Than for a man to hear the song of fools. 6 As crackling thorns beneath a pot, so be Fools laughter: this is also vanity. 7 Oppression surely makes a wise man mad; And gifts destroy, and make the heart more bad. 8 Better's the ending of a thing than the Beginning thereof; also so is he, That's patient in his spirit, better far Than they whose spirits proud and lofty are. 9 Let not thy sp'rit to anger soon make haste; For passions always in fools bosoms rest. 10 Say thou not, what could be the certain cause The former time than now far better was? For thou dost not with wisdom thus enquire Concerning this too curious desire. 11 Wisdom is good with heritage; and they That see the sun, are profited thereby. 12 For wisdom is, for certain, a defence; And so is money in another sense: But this is wisdom's great excellency, That who hath knowledge, he gets life thereby. 13 The work of God consider, and take heed; For who'll make straight what he hath crooked made? 14 Be joyful while in your prosperity; But then, consider, in adversity, That God hath set these two in opposition, To th'end that man should here find no fruition. 15 All things I've seen, and marked carefully, In my short life and days of vanity; The just to perish in his righteousness, The wicked's life prolong'd in wickedness. 16 Be not too good; thyself too wise not make: Why shouldst thou spoil thyself for ruin's sake? 17 Be not too wicked; neither foolish be: Before thy time why shouldst thou love to die? 18 'Tis good that thou shouldst take fast hold of this; Slip not thine hand thine former hold to miss: For who fears God, tho' in the greatest thrall, Shall come triumphant forth out of them all. 19 One man by wisdom stronger is, by far, Than ten stout men that in the city are. 30 For on the earth there's not a just man's lot, That ever doth what's good, and sinneth not. 21 Take thou no heed to ev'ry word you hear, Lest servants chance to curse thee in thine ear. 22 For thou art conscious to thyself thou hast Oft cursed others, tho' not full exprest. 23 All this I prov'd by wisdom; said, I'll be Wise; but, alas! it was too far from me. 24 That which is far off, and is very deep, What man is he can find it out to keep? 25 I did apply mine heart to search and know, And seek by wisdom cause of things below; To know the folly and the wickedness Of foolishness, and of most men's madness: 26 And lo! I find more bitter far than death, The wicked woman's filthy noxious breath; Whose heart is snares, yea, and her very hands Are nets and traps, invincible strong bands. Who pleaseth God, from her he shall 'scape free; But sinners, they by her shall taken be. 27 The preacher saith, Lo! this I have found out, In counting one by one to solve the doubt: 28 Which yet my soul seeks with all care of mind; But, in my search, alas! I cannot find: One man among a thousand have I found; But not a woman all the world around. 29 Lo! this I found, that God made man upright; But man in new inventions takes delight. CHAP. VIII. [1] As the wise man, who can such knowledge bring For plain interpretation of a thing? A man's own wisdom makes his face to shine; But time will make his strength and face decline. 2 I counsel thee to keep the king's command, The oath of God you ought to understand. 3 Make no great haste out of his sight to go; Shun evil things, for what he wills he'll do. 4 Where a king's word is, there his pow'r doth shew: And who can say to him, Sir, what dost thou? 5 Whoe'er he be keeps the commandement, No evil thing shall cause his discontent: A wise man's heart will easily discern, And also time and judgment both will learn. 6 Since to each purpose time and judgment be; Therefore sure great is mortals misery. 7 For he knows nothing of futurity: For who can tell him when, or how 'twill be? 8 No man hath pow'r the spirit to retain; Nor hath he pow'r from dying to refrain: There's no discharge of that warfare; nor can A wicked life preserve a wicked man. 9 All this I've seen; and did my heart apply To ev'ry work done here beneath the sky. There is a time wherein a man doth bear Rule over others, to his hurt full dear. 10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who Did from the church oft-times both come and go; And in the city quite forgot were they, Where they so did: this is a vanity. 11 Because against an evil work sentence Doth not on sinners presently commence; Therefore the hearts of mortal men are still Set in them always fully to do ill. 12 Altho' a sinner should an hundred times Prolong his days, and multiply his crimes; Yet sure I am it shall be well with them That fear the Lord, and reverence his name. 13 But with the wicked well it shall not be, Nor yet protract his lease of life shall he; For as a shadow hath he here abode; For why? because he never feareth God. 14 Here on the earth is done a vanity: The just mens lot like wicked workers be, The wicked's lot as they wrought righteously; I said this also is a vanity. 15 Then I commended mirth; because a man Hath nothing better here below the sun, Than that he eat, and drink, and merry be; For that abides of all his industry, With him the days of his frail life alone, Which God doth give him here below the sun. 16 Wisdom when I apply'd mine heart to know, To see the bus'ness done on earth below; (For there is that yea neither day nor night Lets sleep once dim the optics of his sight.) 17 Then I beheld the work of God, that none Can find out what is wrought below the sun: Because though man should labour seeking it, Yea though a wise man should employ his wit, Thinking to know it; yet he grasps the wind, And never shall attain the same to find. CHAP. IX. [1] For all this I consider'd in my heart, Yea ev'n all this inclining to impart, That both the righteous' works, yea, and the wise Are in God's hand, at his disposal lyes: No man can fully love or hatred know, By all that is before them here below. 2 All things alike come unto all, we see: One event to the just and wicked be; To good, and clean, and the unclean likewise; To him that doth, or doth not sacrifice: As is the good so is the sinner; both That sweareth, yea, and he that fears an oath. 3 This is an evil 'mong all things that's done Under the sun, that there is only one Event to all; yea, and mens haarts are still Of evil, yea, and madness ever full, While here on earth they do enjoy their breath: And after that, they go down unto death. 4 For unto him, for certain, that is join'd To all the living, there is hope we find: For sure a dog that lives, is useful more Than a dead lion that had wont to roar. 5 For sure the living know that they shall die; But those that dead are, know nought certainly: Nor any more have they reward or lot; The memory of them is quite forgot. 6 Also their love, their hatred and envy, Are perished: nor any more have they A portion here of any thing that's done, Upon this stage, below the nat'ral sun. 7 Go, eat thy bread, and drink thy wine with joy; For God accepts thy works and thine employ. 8 Thy garments always white and clean sure make, And let thy head no useful ointment lack. 9 Live with the wise thou lovest joyfully, All the life days of thy short vanity Which he allows thee here below the sun, Till thy few days of vanity are run; For that's thy portion in this life, you know, And in thy labour thou tak'st here below. 10 Whate'er thy hand doth find to do, always Do with thy might; for there is no device, Nor knowledge, work nor wisdom, in the grave, In which e'er long thou must a lodging have. 11 Then I return'd, and saw below the sun, The race is not to them that swiftest run; Nor is the battle to the strongest side; Nor to the wise is there continual bread; Nor yet is riches always in the hand Of prudent men, that well can understand; Nor yet is favour ay to men of skill: But time and chance still happen to them all. 12 An evil man, that sticks not at a crime, He's not aware, nor knows the evil time: As fishes caught are in an evil net, And birds are trapt by snares in secret set; So are men's sons snar'd in an evil time, When suddenly it falleth upon them. 13 Below the sun this wisdom did I see, And it seem'd great and very strange to me. 14 There was a city, and few men within; And a great king to siege it did begin, And round it built great bulwarks, and did raise Great batteries, to take it with more ease. 15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, And by his wisdom he to work began, And freed the city; yet no man did mind The same poor man, unto him to be kind. 16 Then did I say, Wisdom is better far Than the great strength of mighty mortals are: But yet the poor man's wisdom few regard; Yea, and his words are very seldom heard. 17 The wise man's words are heard in quiet more, Than the fool's rulers, though aloud he roar. 18 Wisdom is better far than weapons choice, But sure one sinner he much good destroys. CHAP. X. [1] When flies among the surgeon's ointment sink, It causeth it send forth a noisome stink; So little follies, obvious in the wise, Will make the mob their wisdom soon despise. 2 A wise man's heart is at his right-hand ay; But the fool's heart doth at his left-hand stay. 3 Yea, also, when a fool doth walk abroad, His wisdom fails him on the very road; He acts and speaks without concert or rule, And tells to all he meets that he's a fool. 4 If rulers spirits up against thee rise, Leave not thy place as one that guilty flies; For yielding great offences pacifies. 5 Below the sun an evil I have seen Come from the ruler as an error keen: 6 Folly set in great dignity and trust, The rich and wise in lowest places thrust: 7 I have seen servants on high horses ride, And princes walking on the earth beside. 8 Who digs a pit, himself shall fall in it; Who breaks an hedge, a serpent shall him bite. 9 He may be hurt, that stones removes; likely Who cleaveth wood, in danger is thereby. 10 If th'ax be blunt, and he be not expert To sharp the edge, more strength he must exert: But wise men will not means of ease neglect; For wisdom's useful therein to direct. 11 The serpent will without enchantment bite; So babblers will in talking take delight. 12 The wise man's words, that come out from his mouth, Are gracious words, yea words of precious truth; But the fool's lips, poor senseless silly elf! So froward are, they'll swallow up himself. 13 For he begins his words with foolishness, And ends the same in mad mischievousness. 14 A fool also is full of words: surely Man cannot tell what afterward shall be; And who is he for certain can proclaim To any man what shall be after him? The foolish' labour weariness doth prove For each of them; because if he remove Abroad (poor wretch!) he's not so wise, or witty, To find the way again into the city. 16 Wo be to thee, O land! thy state is wild, When as thy king is but a minor child; And when thy princes, be they ne'er so great, Do in the morning too too early eat. 17 But blessed art thou, O thou happy land! When doth the son of nobles thee command, And when thy princes in due season eat, For strength, not drunkenness, which spoils the state. 18 By slothfulness the building soon decays; By idleness the house drops thro' likewise. 19 Feasts are for laughter, wine doth merry make; But money answers all we undertake. 20 Curse not the king, yea, no not in thy thought, Nor in thy closet curse the rich for ought: Birds of the air thy voice shall sure reveal, And what hath wings the matter clear shall tell. CHAP. XI. [1] Thy bread cast on the waters diff'rent ways, And thou shalt find it after many days. 2 To seven and eight a portion give; for thou Know'st not what ill shall be on earth below. 3 If that the clouds be full of rain, they will Empty themselves, and on the earth distil: And if the tree fall South or North, ev'n where The tree shall fall, it surely shall be there. 4 Who foolishly observes the wind, or who Regards the clouds, shall neither reap nor sow. 5 As thou know'st not which way the spirits come, Nor how the bones engender in the womb Of her with child; so canst thou never know The works of God, that maketh all things grow. 6 Then in the morning sow thy seed; and when The ev'ning-comes, thy sowing not refrain: For sure thou know'st not whether that or this Shall prosper well, or both alike increase. 7 'Tis truly sweet and pleasant for the eye To see the light and sun shine from on high. 8 But if a man live many years, and shall Take much delight, rejoicing in them all; Yet let him mind the days of darkness, they Shall many be, and all in vanity. 9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let Thy youthful days on cheerfulness be set: Walk in the ways which thine own heart devise, And after what is pleasing to thine eyes: But know thou, surely God for ev'ry thing Will thee one day unto his judgment bring. 10 Therefore remove all sorrow from thy heart, And cause all evil from thy flesh depart: For all may know this for a certainty, Childhood and youth are surely vanity. CHAP. XII. [1] Remember now thy great Creator, while The bloom of youth upon thy cheeks doth smile; While ill days come not, nor the years draw near, When thou shalt say, I have no pleasure here; 2 While sun, light, moon, nor stars, not dark'ned be, Nor clouds returning after rain you see: 3 In that sad day, when the house-keepers shall Tremble, and strong men bowing down shall fall, The grinders cease, because they are but few, And lookers from the windows lose their view. 4 The doors shall in the streets be shut, also The sound of grinding turned very low; And he shall rise up at the bird's small voice, And all the daughters of the music cease: 5 When they shall be afraid of what is high, Fears in the way appearing ever nigh; The almond-tree shall flourish fair above, The grashopper shall then a burden prove; Desire shall fail, because that man must go To his long home, and mourners walk in wo: 6 Or e'er the cord of silver loosed be, Or golden bowl be broken, or you see The pitcher broken by the fountain side, Or wheel asunder at the cistern slide. 7 Then shall the dust to earth again descend, Just as it was, like to its like still tend; The spirit upward, as a spark, shall fly To God, who gave it, where he is on high. 8 Vanity of vanities we see: The preacher saith, All is mere vanity. 9 Likewise, because the preacher was most wise, He knowledge taught the people all his days: He gave good heed, sought out what he could get, And many proverbs he in order set. 10 The preacher sought out words both plain and smooth; And what he wrote was upright words of truth. 11 Words of the wise as goads and nails they are, Fast'ned by masters of assemblies care, Which from one shepherd freely given were. 12 Further, my son, by these admonish'd be; Of making books there is no end you see; And too much study is a weariness, And very irksome unto human flesh. 13 Let's hear the whole conclusion of the matter, Of all that can be said by word or letter: Fear God, and keep all his commands; for this Man's duty wholly and entirely is. 14 For God to judgment ev'ry work shall bring, Together also with each secret thing; Yea, whether it be good or bad, one day In public manner he will open lay.</field>
