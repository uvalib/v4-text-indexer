      <field name="fulltext">TO The Memory of WILLIAM ROBERTSON THESE POEMS ARE AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED BY “HUGH HALIBURTON”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. In town I walk by this lake-side, I fish in yonder pool; In streets I see o'er mountains wide The morning opening cool. Here later fate has cast my lines, And half my life's been spent; Yet countryward my heart inclines, True to its native bent. City, no son of yours am I, Who bring from boyhood down The memory of the open sky And hills and valleys lown. In vain your traffic hems me in; In vain ye grind and bray; I hear through your discordant din The plashing of the May; The Farg's low treble takes my ear, And, though long silent, still With all the boy's delight I hear The hum of Pottie mill. In vain your reek, in vain your smeek; Through't a' I yet discern The peace that mantles Baigley peak, The skies that span Strathearn. Hughie's Advice to Dauvit to Enjoy the Fine Weather. “Gratia cum nymphis geminisque sororibus audet Ducere nuda choros.” —Car. iv. 7. An' noo ance mair the Lomon' Has donn'd his mantle green, An' we may gang a-roamin' Thro' the fields at e'en; An' listen to the rustlin' O' green leaves i' the shaw, An' hear the blackbird whistlin' Winter weel awa'. Sae mild's the weather, Dauvit, That was but late sae bauld, We gang withoot a grauvit, Careless o' the cauld. An' juist the ither nicht, man, Twa barefit Mays were seen (It maun hae been a sicht, man!) Dancin' on the green. It sets a body thinkin' Hoo quick the moments fly, Hoo fast the days gang linkin'! Spring 'ill sune be by; Then Simmer wi' the roses, Then Autumn wi' the grain; Then Winter comes an' closes A' thing ance again! An' yet, tho' short her range is, Dame Nature's never dune; She just repeats the changes, Just renews the tune. The auld mune to her ruin Gangs rowin' doon the sky, When, swith, a braw bran new ane Cocks her horn on high! Alas! when oor short mornin' Slides doun the slope to nicht, There's neither tide nor turnin' Back to life an' licht. We fa' as fell oor faithers Into the narrow hame, An' fog forgetfu' gaithers Owre oor very name. But what needs a' this grievin' For griefs we dinna feel? Let's leeve as lang's we're leevin', Lauch as lang's we're weel. An' if it's gude i' gloamin' It's better sune than syne To rise an' gang a-roamin' Noo the weather's fine. Hughie refuses to Emigrate. “Ibi tu calentem Debita sparges lacrima favillam Vatis amici.” —Car. ii. 6. Matthie, nae mair! Ye'se gang your lane! Tak' my best wishes wi' ye, An' may guid fortune owre the main An' snugly settled see ye! I wuss ye weel! The kintra's lairge, An ye're but twa wi' Mary; Ye'll shortly hae the owner's chairge, Nae doot, o' half a prairie. There's ample room in sic a park To foond a score o' nations, An' flourish like a patriarch Amon' your generations. But me may Scotland's bonnie hills Maintain to utmost auld age, Leadin' my flocks by quiet rills, An' lingerin' thro' the gold age; Untemptit wi' a foreign gain That mak's ye merely laird o't, An' thinkin' Scotland a' min' ain, Tho' ownin' ne'er a yaird o't! What hills are like the Ochil hills? There's nane sae green, tho' grander; What rills are like the Ochil rills? Nane, nane on earth that wander! There Spring returns amon' the sleet, Ere Winter's tack be near thro'; There Spring an' Simmer fain wad meet To tarry a' the year thro'! An' there in green Glendevon's shade A grave at last be found me, Wi' daisies growin' at my head An' Devon lingerin' round me! Nae stane disfigurement o' grief Wi' lang narration rise there; A line wad brawly serve, if brief, To tell the lave wha lies there. But ony sculptur'd wecht o' stane Wad only overpow'r me; A shepherd, musin' there his lane, Were meeter bendin' owre me. Hughie's Reply to the Laird's Intimation of a Visit. “Mea nec Falernæ Temperant vites neque Formiani Pocula colles.” —Car. i. 20. Dear laird, ye're comin' up the brae As lang's gude weather haulds? Ye're surely welcome to a day Amang your ain sheep-faulds. If caller air, an' caperin' lamb, An' knowes o' noddin' green, Wi' noo an' then a social dram Or twa-haund crack atween; The food wher'on your fathers fared, A girdle scone an' cheese— Ye're freely welcome to them, laird, If thae hae power to please; But if your craig maun hae its waucht O' wines I canna name,— They're no' within a shepherd's aucht: Ye'd better bide at hame. Hughie's Anxiety for Davy on the Seas. “Navis, quæ tibi creditum Debes Virgilium.” —Car. i. 3. Noo a' ye winds, but ane, that rair An' revel on the deep, Respect for ance a poet's pray'r— Swith to your caves, an' sleep! For Davy's sake, wha taks the tide This mornin', be commaundit: There's fifty folk on Devonside That wuss him safely laundit. An' you, wham only we excepp— Ahint his ship, an' blaw! An' mind oor hearts are in that ship That carries him awa'! We'll wauk the nicht upon oor hip If ye should mak' commotion, An' think the hoose is Davy's ship An' Ochil earth the ocean! Wha first to earth's green limits ran An' coveted the sea— Wha first to bigg a ship began, A daurin' loon was he. As seas an' surges owre him lash'd, An' monsters wallowed roond him, Didna his speerit shrink abash'd, His hardihood confoond him? Surely the oceans were design'd To separate the lands, An' men in wisdom were confin'd In kindly kindred bands. But mankind are a restless race, Aye seekin' new inventions, An' warpin' a' the gifts o' grace Clean fra their first intentions. We gruppit steam: nae doot at first It lookit braw an' fine; But mony a pat an' boiler burst Has answer'd for't sin' syne. We flew a draigon: an' the spark Obeys a bairn if need is; But look at the mischeevous wark That's wrocht wi' thir torpeedies. It's lang sin' pouther was fund oot; But we've dune weel oorsel'— We've raised in dynamite, I doot, The mucklest deil in hell. There's naething that we'll no' attemp' If danger but commend it; We're mairchin' at a bonnie tramp— But, Lordsake! what's to end it? Hughie sympathises with Jocky on his well-earned Rest. “Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor Ter pede terram.” —Car. iii. 18. Now Jocky's freed! The bands are broke That tied him to the hated yoke; Rejoicing in his freedom found, With heavy heel he hits the ground. In thraldom to the red earth bound, Sweet Jocky's griefs were of the ground; Now, bondsman with a broken chain, He leaps upon his tyrant slain. Leeze me on simmer!—but she brings A heavy load of hempen strings; She ties sweet Jocky to the wark Fra morning dim till gloaming dark. His haunds are hard, his banes are sair; Wi' but the gift o' caller air, He plants his feet in many a soil, He leaves in many a clod his toil. But noo nae mair he'll drag his feet; The labour o' the year's complete: Now beat the stibble-laund wi' glee, And fling aloft with fetlock free! On loft with rural joy he jumps, He beats the ground with triple thumps! The lingering vigour of his legs He leaves upon the hated rigs! Now heap the hearth with peats an' whins; And, Jocky, rest and roast your shins,— Till Candlemas with blustering shout Cry Jocky and his oxen out! Hughie at the Maiden's Well. “Fies nobilium tu quoque fontium.” —Car. iii. 13. Thou bonnie modest mountain spring, That tinkles oot aneth a stane, An' seems to thy ainsel' to sing— For listener near is nane— There's neither birk nor rowan tree Bends owre thy brink to shelter thee, An' but ae gowan fra the lea Has wander'd here its lane. I thocht nae cretur near e'en-noo, Till, as I loutit doun to drink, Awa' wi' flichterin' flurry flew A lintie fra the brink. I'm dootfu' if it was a bird, Sae still it sat afore it stirr'd, Then, swifter than I'll say the wird, Gaed by me in a blink. Was it the fairy o' the fount Disturbit in her maiden dream, That, takin' fricht on my account, Was startled fra her hame? Thou lovely Thocht o' Solitude! Nae mair will I wi' footstep rude, An' harsh an' hasty wirds, intrude Upon thy haly stream. Sae fare-thee-weel, sweet Maiden's Well! Baith sun and weet thy waters spare! Thou minds me o' a maid thysel', Sae meek thy modest air. Thy siller thread is hardly seen Winding the solemn hills between, Yet a' the way the banks o' green Give proof that thou art there. Note.—The Maiden's Well lies on the edge of the old bridle-path over the hills, about two miles behind Castle Campbell. Its beauty is in itself—cool, clear, and copious; sine floribus, yet not without its wreath of pastoral legend. Hughie's Waddin' Gift to his friend Jame. “Ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi.” —Car. i. 18. Ye're leavin' 's Jame! nae langer noo To rank amon' the wanters— By way o' waddin' gift fra Hugh Accepp thir twa decanters. They're fill'd wi' Scotland's native juice— An' whaur's a nobler liquor? They'll aiblins help to heat your hoose, An' mak' your union siccar. Ye'll hae your joys: John Barleycorn May wi' advantage share them! Ye'll hae your griefs: fill up your horn— He'll gie ye heart to bear them! Tak' aff your dram an' crack your joke However Fortun' vary; It's only aye to water folk She's cauldrife an' contrairy! Ye're puir; but, Jamie, tak' nae thocht,— The maist o' folk are born till't! Dae weel; syne if ye're fash'd wi' ocht, Lift up a hielant horn till't! We've a' oor troubles mair or less, But to cry oot is weak-like; Regairdit thro' a social gless The warld's nane sae bleak-like! Yet, when ye at the board unbend At nae unworthy season, Be mindfu' aye to mak' an end Conformable to reason. For aince if owre the boun's they win, The passions quickly speak oot, An' secrets, that are safer in, Are likelier then to leak oot. Then self-indulgence, lang alloo'd, Becomes a second nature, To change the manner an' the mood, An' e'en the very feature. There's Rabbie wi' the muckle mooth That married Meg that mantit— He drank himsel' into a drooth, An' noo he canna want it! An' then there's gauger Pate—but he 'S nae waur than what his wife is; Ye'll read it in his blecken'd ee What his domestic life is. Tak' warnin', Jamie, by their case, An' learn fra their example, While pleasure's in the mod'rate use, The mod'rate use is ample. The White Winter: Hughie dreads the Return of the Ice Age. “Jam satis terris nivis atque diræ Grandinis misit Pater.” —Car. i. 2. Man, but it's vexin'! There's the Law For five months noo been white wi' snaw; An', when we lookit for a thaw, An' lowser weather, It's gaitherin' for anither fa', As black as ever! It's no' alane that fother's dear, Yowes stervin', an' the lambin' near, An' Winter owre the Ochils drear Drivin' unstintit,— But, Lordsake! what's come owre the year? An' what's ahint it? Wha kens but what oor aixle tree 'S been slew'd aboot, or dung ajee, An' aff thro' space awa' we flee In a daft orbit? Whilk mak's the seasons, as we see, Be sair disturbit. Wha kens but what we've seen the heel O' Simmer in a last fareweel? Nae mair green gowany braes to speel Wi' joyfu' crook, Nor dip in Devon, whaur a wiel Invites to dook! What ance has been may be ance mair, An' ance—as learnèd clerks declare— This planet's fortune was to fare, In ages auld, Thro' regions o' the frigid air, Past kennin' cauld. Nae doot but this was centuries gane, When human cretur' there was nane, An' this auld warld, her liefu' lane, Bowl'd thro' the nicht, Wi' tangles hingin' fra a mune, Her only licht. An eldritch scene that licht display'd! There lay the continents array'd, Like corpses o' the lately dead, In a cauld sheet, Wi' icebergs sittin' at their head An' at their feet! What ance has been may happen twice,— It's weel kenn'd we hae little ch'ice; An' if it be the Age o' Ice Return'd ance mair— Faith, tak' this present for a spice, It offers fair! The snaw a' owre lies sax feet deep; Ae half oor time we're howkin' sheep; We haena haen a blanket sleep Sin' the New Year; An' here we're at oor hin'most neep, An' term-time near! It's juist as bad wi' ither folk: A shepherd's missin' wi' his flock; An eagle's ravagin' the Knock; An' nearer hame, A dearth o' whisky's at the Crook, An' aumries toom. The gates are blockit up a' roun' 's, Silent are a' the seas an' soun's, An' at the very trons in toons It's hoch deep lyin': In fac', the Winter's broken boun's, There's nae denyin'. It may be—for we're grown sae wice, We're no' juist to be smoor'd like mice,— It may be that by some device We'll fricht the snaw, An' gie this threaten'd Age o' Ice The ca' awa'! Some braw electrical machine Amang the cluds may intervene, Send licht an' heat, an' change the scene The warld throughoot; An' burn oor skins, an' blind oor een, Wi't a', nae doot! Come back, come back, oor ain auld sun, Thy auld-appointed path to run; An' a' the freits that were begun To shore us ill Shall, in the crackin' of a gun, Flee owre the hill. Then, as of auld, when skies are clear, An' springin' corn begins to breer, Those joys your shepherd's heart shall cheer That charm'd of yore; An' life on Devon be as dear As heretofore! Hughie's Delight in the Return of Spring. “Audire et videor pios Errare per lucos, amœnæ Quos et aquæ subeunt et auræ.” —Car. iii. 4. I Fra whaur in fragrant wuds ye bide Secure fra winter care, Come, gentle Spring, to Ochilside And Ochil valleys fair. For sweet as ony pagan spring Are Devon's waters clear; And life wad be a lovely thing Gif ye were only here. II She comes! the waffin' o' her wings Wi' music fills the air; An' wintry thochts o' men an' things Vex human hearts nae mair. On Devon banks wi' me she strays, Her poet for the while, And Ochil brooks and Ochil braes Grow classic in her smile! Hughie's Bachelor Party. “Da lunæ propere novæ, Da noctis mediæ.” —Car. iii. 19. Ay, here they come, thrang warstlin' up the brae Like sheep in single file, No' ane o' them wi' lang'age left—they're sae Forfoughen wi' their toil. Tammy, ye're first—but tailors for a broose! Willie, my man, your paw! Ye're pechan', Pate! Weel, Watty, what's the noos? An' Lowrie's last o' a'! What! no a wird? Weel, stand an' tak' a breath, An' view the scene awhile; I weel believe it, Pate, withoot the aith— It was that hin'most mile. Ay, lads, ye're high—ye're up amang the groose; That was the muir-cock's craw! But in! ye're welcome to the Shepherd's hoose; I'm gled to see ye a'. Draw in your chairs—na! no' until I see Five auld frien's plantit richt! An' noo, afore I fesh the barley-bree, Nae politics the nicht! There's Watty wi' the budget in his wime— Noo, Watty, haud your haund; The wise man says that a' thing has its time, But here—ye're aff your laund. Gude-fallowship's the fashion i' the hills, An' fechtin' i' the toun: If either Whig or Tory ventur'd till 's— Man, we wad shute them doun! Come, come! a bargain be't. An'hoo's your hoast? An' what's the price o' woo'? Has Bauby gotten owre that bairn she lost? But was the deacon fu'? That whusky duty!—but we'll lat it be; It mayna get oor length! Here's to ye, Pate! Willie—it's wat your ee! Lad, that's the stuff for strength! Here's a big bumper for us a' thegither! But wha's that at the pane? The new mune keekin' in a kind o' swither! 'Faith, we maun gie her ane! Ane for the nicht; an' ane for Jock the cadger Wha brocht the tappit hen; An' ane for him, too, honest man! the gauger Wha lost himsel' i' glen! Nae pressin'—na! ilk man should ken his score! A sober gauge is six! There's water in a stoup ahint the door For them that want to mix. Na, but I'm blythe—I'm daft to see ye a'! Lowrie, produce your flute, We maun hae music;—first we'll take your blaw, An' syne a sang fra Pate. Then in a chorus sang we'll soop the heather Till the waste places ring, An' social coveys sleepin' soun' thegither Break aff on startled wing. An' let that churlish Nawbal o' a fermer, Oor nippit neebor, hear; An' lovely Abigail, as I may term her, That should be—Dauvit's dear! O Tam, ye're happy in your love for Meg, Ye're blest—ye're free o' blame; But I maun burn for what I daurna beg,— For her I daurna name! Note.—The reference in the 9th stanza is to the increased duty on whisky, threatened by a recent Budget. Hughie's Winter Excuse for a Dram. “Vides ut alta stet nive candidum Soracte.” —Car. i. 9. Fra whaur ye hing, my cauldrife frien', Your blue neb owre the lowe, A snawy nichtcap may be seen Upon Benarty's pow; An' snaw upon the auld gean stump, Whas' frostit branches hang Oot-owre the dyke abune the pump That's gane clean aff the fang. The pump that half the toun's folk ser'd, It winna gie a jaw, An' rouch, I ken, sall be your beard Until there comes a thaw! Come, reenge the ribs, an' let the heat Doun to oor tinglin' taes; Clap on a gude Kinaskit peat An' let us see a blaze. An' since o' water we are scant Fess ben the barley-bree— A nebfu' baith we sanna want To wet oor whistles wi'! Noo let the winds o' Winter blaw Owre Scotland's hills an' plains, It matters nocht to us ava— We've simmer in oor veins! The pooers o' Nature, wind an' snaw, Are far abune oor fit, But while we scoog them, let them blaw; We'll aye hae simmer yet. An' sae wi' Fortune's blasts, my frien',— They'll come an' bide at will, But we can jink ahint a screen An' jook their fury still. Then happy ilka day that comes, An' glorious ilka nicht; The present doesna fash oor thooms, The future needna fricht! The future!—man, there's joys in store, An' joys ye little ken; The warld has prov'd them sweet afore, The warld will again! The lasses, min! the dearest gift An' treasure time can gie— Here's to the love that lichts the lift O' woman's witchin' ee! An' vainly till that licht expire Should storm or winter low'r— It's sune aneuch to seek the fire When simmer days are owre! Note.—Kinaskit, as its inhabitants pronounce Kinnesswood, is a small village at the foot of the Lomond Hill and not far from Lochleven. In its neighbourhood is a small peat-moss, from which the surrounding villages and farm-towns used to be supplied with fuel. To the student of English literature the village of Kinnesswood has other associations—those, namely, connected with Michael Bruce. Hughie Consoles and Counsels young Nannie in the Absence of Davie. “Prima nocte domum claude, neque in vias Sub cantu querulæ despice tibiæ.” —Car. iii. 7. O dry that tear that trickles doun For Davie owre the sea; The fates 'ill keep him safe an' soun', An' that for sake o' thee. What pleasure wad it gie the fates To vex a heart like thine Whas' only wish on Davie waits, Whas' hopes roun' Davie twine. An' dinna wrang his faithfu' heart By dootin' if he's true; Sweet Nannie! far owre fair thou art For him to brak' his voo. Sweet Nannie! there's nae fairer face, Nor mair bewitchin' ee, In ony frem'd or foreign place For Davie's een to see! To thee he turns, for thee he toils, O' thee lies doun to dream, Or wauks the nicht to coont the miles Between him an' his hame. O dinna doot that Nannie's charms 'Ill draw him owre the main To Nannie's fond an' faithful arms An' Devon's banks again. But, Nannie, hearken in your ear— It's kent to ane or twa That hielant Donal' wad draw near Noo Davie's far awa. An' sweetly soonds his pipe, it's true, When gloamin' gaithers dim— 'Faith! Dave has mair to fear fra you Than you've to fear fra him! Hughie takes his Ease in his Inn. “Vates quid orat de patera novum Fundens liquorem.” —Car. i. 31. Noo, by my croon, the sun sends doun Uncommon drouthy weather, But here's an inn—if it were sin We'll spill a dram thegither! An' while we sit an' rest oor fit, Surveyin' man's dominion, We'll tak' a glance at things that chance, An' freely pass opinion. Yon stookit grain that dots the plain— We canna ca' a lead o't; The herd that strays on yonder braes— We canna claim a head o't. It's no' in beeves an' baundit sheaves That we can coont oor wealth, Tam; Yet, nane the less, there's happiness To puir folk wi' their health, Tam. There needs but sma' estate to ca' Awa' the wants that fear folk; While mony wares bring mony cares That never trouble puir folk. An' for the yield o' hill or field— It's little that we're spar'd o't, But to the ee it's just as free To hiz as him that's laird o't. Gie knaves their wine—this drink be mine, Auld Scotland's native brewin'! O' this bereft, there's water left, Wi' that we'll e'en be doin'! Gie fules their braws—they've aiblins cause To be sae finely wrappit; The man that's in a healthy skin, He's brawly if he's happit. Gie him a horse wha wants the force To drive his ain shanks' naigie; What can he ken o' wud or glen, Or mountain wild an' craigie? Wad Fortun' grant me what I want I'd pray for health o' body, A healthy mind to sang inclin'd, An' nae dislike for toddy! Hughie Visits a Sick Friend. “Ibimus, ibimus, Utcumque præcedes supremum Carpere iter comites parati.” —Car. ii. 17. Davie, auld frien', ye've been a long time ailin', Ye've suffer'd mony a weary week o' pain, But dinna think, an' dinna say ye're failin'; Health an' your hopes may a' come back again. Hoo aften hae we wuss'd, my frien', my brither, Leadin' our flocks alang the lown hillside, Thro' life, thro' death to wander on thegither, Content to gang, yet weel content to bide! Man! as I come in-ower fra the green meadow Whaur late-born lambs are toddlin' i' the sun, An' see ye lyin' here, a wastit shadow, Weak as the least and latest life begun, Without its hopes, tho' aiblins wi' a greater, An' me sae hale an hearty lookin' on, Pooerless to help—it's no' in human natur' To leave thae life-lang dreams without a groan. Davie, it canna be; ower muir an' mountain Comes surgin' fra the south the tide o' Spring: Licht to the lift, an' music to the fountain, An' spray o' flooers a' gate its billows fling. O' winter's snaw there's but a tate remainin', Gowans and laverocks gladden sky an' lea, An' maun ye, Moses-like, on this new Canaan Cast but a glance, an' syne lie doun an' dee? What signifies the simmer's gowden splendour O' days an' starry nichts to me my lane? What breath o' balm, what timorous touch an' tender O' wind could comfort me, an' Davie gane? The year's melodious mirth on me were wastit, In wuds an' watters hearin' but a wail; Fra me the cup o' joy wad pass untastit, An' a' the sweets o' life an' livin' fail. An' you,—whaure'er in fields abune ye dander'd, Wha's mornin' prime endures the ages thro', By whatna crystal wave unkent ye wander'd, 'Neth skies wi' ne'er a clud to blot their blue; Tho' ne'er a glint fra hope ye bude to borrow, Secure in calm, unkennin' cauld or care,— My mournin', like a sough o' autumn sorrow, Wad follow ye, an' fret ye even there! Davie, it's no' the first time we hae fand it A joyfu' truth that Providence is kind: Let's warstle thro' the doots whaur noo we're landit, An' face the future still wi' even mind. The gate o' death, by which we a' maun enter— By it we'll meet, tho' late an' lang it be: Peace be wi' him whaever first maun enter, But patience is a harder weird to dree! Hughie on War and Sport. “Quem tu, Melpomene,” &amp;c. —Car. iv. 3. Wham at his birth wi' mournfu' smile The Muse has ance regairdet, Shall ne'er in field o' battle toil To be with bays rewairdet. Yet shall he haunt, a lanely ghost, The placid battle plain— To mourn the lives that there were lost, The loves that there were slain. Hoo caulder for thae stricken lives Maun mony a hearth hae been; Hoo blank to mony bairns an' wives The social hoor at e'en! Nae hunter on the heather hills Bird-slaughterin' shall he be, Nor fisher rivin' fra the gills O' some puir troot his flee. Yet shall he love the dusky pools And speel the mountain stairs, Unburdened wi' the murderin' tools O' guns an' gauds an' snares,— O'erjoy'd to find attractions rife In Nature's ilka feature, And share the brotherhood of life With every happy creature. Oh, what avails a victor's name At close of battle clangour? This warld is far owre sma' for fame, And life owre short for anger. Hughie's Early Memories. “Ille me tecum locus et beatæ Postulant arces.” —Car. ii. 6. When green again, a gledsome hue, The auld hill-taps cam' back to view, An' cluds broke up, an' skies shone thro', An' glorified the Ochils,— I mind it weel, we took the braes, We left the toun like hunted raes, We hardly waited for oor claes, To rin an' speel the Ochils! We lap the burns for bud an' bell, We scour'd for whussle-wud the dell, And ance we happen'd on a stell, High up amang the Ochils! We sheuk the buss, we staned the seggs, We scaur'd the wild-dyuck aff her eggs, We scaur'd the heron aff his legs, And aff the very Ochils! When Simmer days were lang an' fine, We cam' wi' wicker wands an' twine, An' tint, an' thocht it heaven to tine, The 'oors amang the Ochils! Tho' deil a mony troots we gruppit, Baith owre and in the linns we luppit, And to the sark, or past it, strippit, Secure amang the Ochils! Oor breeks lay scatter'd on the banks, We kirn'd the water wi' oor shanks, An' salmon-red we play'd oor pranks, Run deils amang the Ochils! When Autumn sent the settled weather, We lay amang the purple heather, Listening the bees for 'oors thegither Bummin' a' ower the Ochils! We spied the lairds, a beardit lot, Wi' cudgel-staff an' raucous throat, Stappin' aboot, withoot the coat, At hame amang the Ochils! When Winter cam', an' frosts were keen, An' snaw-ploos in the street were seen, We saw them like a far-aff frien',— They were anither Ochils! What tragedy o' bird an' beass, Destruction to the cock-laird race, We kentna o', we could but guess, Was happenin' i' the Ochils! But green again, a gledsome hue, The auld hill-taps cam' back to view, An' the cock-lairds gat up, an' crew Possession o' the Ochils! A Stormy Night: Hughie hobnobbing at Home. “Alga litus inutili Demissa tempestas ab Euro Sternet, aquæ nisi fallit augur.” —Car. iii. 17. George, son of lairds that awn'd the laund, Sin' Scotland was a nation— And yet ye tak' a higher staund Than that o' generation: What tho' your pedigree ye trace Frae maister an' frae madam? The meanest figure wi' a face, He bude to come fra Adam. George, worthy son o' honest folk! I canna rank ye high'r— I spend this nicht at aucht o'clock Beside my ain peat fire. The mune, sair burden'd wi' a broch, Shaws nouther face nor form; And there's a moanin' aff the loch That bodes the comin' storm. Gie Borlan' Jock, the cadger loon, An' poacher tho' he is, As he gangs drookit by your toon, A dram for bringin' this: An' for oorsel's—we'll play the joke We've play'd sae aften noo: Drink up to me at aucht o'clock, And I'll drink doun to you! Hughie in Murnins: he Laments the Loss o' his Frien' Andro. “Ergo Quinctilium perpetuus sopor Urget!” —Car. i. 24. What man or minister 'ill dare Haud oot his haund, an' cry Forbear! This wild, this waefu' sorrow spare; It's Nature's debt? But I will band an' weepers wear For Andro yet! O for the wail o' Autumn wun's, An' trees, an' seas, an' settin' suns, An' melancholy muirlan' whuns, An' hillside sadness! O for the greetin' voice that runs Thro' Nature's gladness! So Andro's gane! the last lang sleep Has fa'en upon him, an' he's deep! An' noo he doesna hear a cheep O' a' we're talkin'; An' we in vain a watch wad keep For him to wauken. It's no' the stroke, tho' fell an' grim, The bosom cauld, the moveless limb, That melt an' mak oor een sae dim, Oor heart sae sair— But oh! what virtues sleep wi' him That's lyin' there! He was sae modest an' sae true— Truth was engraven on his broo! Strict wi' himsel', an' slack wi' you, An' even-mindit: His peer, search a' the parish thro', Ye wadna find it! An' noo he's gane! he's crost the mark Atween us an' that ocean dark, Whereon some day oor ain frail bark Maun sink or sail; But here nae mair again we'll hark His kindly hail. Hughie's Appraisement of the Ochils. “Aurum irrepertum et sic melius situm, Quum terra celat, spernere fortior Quam cogere, humanos in usus Omne sacrum rapiente dextra.” —Car. iii. 3. Wi' couthie farms an' faulds adorn'd, An' hirsels without number; Wi' hummelt kye an' kyloes horn'd, Red, yellow, black, and umber; And, abune a', wi' bannet lairds, The cocks o' the creation— Heaven spare their patriarchal beards, An' speed their generation! What hills are like the Ochil hills, Unless it be the Lomon'? And whaur on earth are sweeter rills To daunder by i' gloamin'? Their caller side the Allan cools, Their sunny side the Devon, Wi' dusky plumms an' crystal pools, Reflecting hill and heaven. Hoo sweet their waters to the ee, Or round the ankles playin', Or mairried to the barley-bree, The fisher's thirst allayin'! Gang freely, fishers, by their banks, Baith foreign loons an' locals, An' fling your flees, an' breathe your thanks, That Nature made the Ochils! Wha wadna keep this rampart free, That rises green amang us? What ither haunt or howff hae we When warld's cares owregang us? It's something to escape the stoor The fecht wi' fortune raises, An' rin a laddie for an hoor Barefit amang the daisies. But here-streek oot your shanks at lairge; There's no' a buird to stay ye; Nor menace o' a trespass chairge, Nor upstart to nay-say ye. There's no' a biggin' wi' a ruif, But mak's ye welcome hither; There's no a farmer wi' a luif, But grips ye like a brither. There's no' a tyke that has a tail But waves 'd aloft to greet ye; The very fanners and the flail Are whirlin' mad to meet ye! Heaven keep the Ochil rampart free, That rises green amang us! What better randyvoo could be, If fate or folly dang us? May never tunnel pierce its hert, Nor mill nor mine disturb it, But Nature flourish here, and Airt Keep in her Lowland orbit. Ae moodiewart there was that socht To mine an' mak' a gain o't; Thank Heaven! his howkin' cam' to nocht, He'd naething but the pain o't. But had that limmer ha'en the power— We ken what bizz'd in he's caip! He'd whummled the haill Ochils ower As I would cowp a beeskep! But what does impious Folly care For happy habitations? She'd overturn a palace fair To seize on the foundations. Note.—For the moodiewart, see ‘Scotland and Scotsmen in the Eighteenth Century.’ He was Lord Tinwald, whose unforgivable sin it was to say that “if one could turn over the Ochils like a beehive, something worth while in minerals might be got.” The Dog-Days: Hughie's Invitation to a Weaver Friend. “Adduxere sitim tempora, Virgili!” —Car. iv. 12. An' noo the dog-days an' their ills Come on us fra the sooth, An' we wha live amang the hills Are a' brunt up wi' drooth! The kye are stan'in' i' the linns, Or tiggin' owre the braes; An' oor wee laddie-herd—he rins Skeer nakit, wantin' claes! Noo, Wull, ye auld divertin' loon, Nae wonder nor you're thin; I meikle fear the smoory toon Has left ye nocht but skin! Lay aff your apron, an' your care, Till a' this heat be by; An' come an' see hoo we folk fare That live by sheep an' kye. That hide o' yours, ye willow wand! I'll mak' a couthie place for't; And bring a lemon i' your hand, We'll aiblins find a use for't. There's folk that ca' a dram a crime— Their virtue's cheap, I'm thinkin'; At least it's pleasant, and the time Seems to invite to drinkin'! Hughie's Dedication. “Vester, Camenæ, vester in arduos Tollor Sabinos.” —Car. iii. 4. Whether alang the tawny bent Diffused in simmer time, Or like a mountain torrent pent In city stane an' lime,— While fickle seasons tak' the gate Owre passive wud an' lea, My lease o' life I dedicate, Sweet Poesy, to thee. Noo weirdless Winter wi' his waste Shall trouble me nae mair, Nor joys that to destruction haste Oppress my soul wi' care. For wild amang the roarin' floods, Yet sweet, I hear thee sing, And in the cleavin' o' the cluds I see thy soarin' wing. Sweet Poesy! with thee to range Owre field and forest free, An' fearless aye o' earthly change, Were happiness to me! An' when at last wi' kindly gloom The gloamin' comes, to ken That death is ither than a doom Unto the sons o' men! Hughie's Advice to auld Tammy to tak' the Use o' his Savings. “Linquenda tellus et domus.” —Car. ii. 14. Ye're agein', Tammy, agein' fast, The season o' your strength is past; Ye're white but whaur ye're bauld; The footmarks o' the craw are seen Aboot the corners o' your een— Ye're auld, my frien', ye're auld! There's some that on life's mornin' road Fall in their glorious strength, An' some, like you, that bear the load O' life the weary length; But hame still, the same still, We've a' to find oor way; What maitter tho' later Or earlier in the day? Tammy, ye've lived to be a laird, Ye awn a stane house, an' a yaird Wi' fruit-trees on your wa'; Ye keep a powny, an' ye've kye, Ye've siller i' the bank forbye— Ye'll need to leave it a'! What need ye, then, to strive an' strain, An' fret your saul wi' care, To gaither gear an' treasure gain A' for a spendthrift heir? He's waitin', like Satan, But if he ance win in, He'll dance throu't, an' prance throu't, An' scatter't a' like sin! Hughie driven in by a Tempest: he Defies the Elements from behind a Jorum. “Rapiamus, amici, Occasionem de die, dumque virent genua.” —Car. v. 13. An angry tempest, roarin' lood, Is broken lowse an' ragin' free; The knock-wud groans wi' anguish boo'd, An' rocks an' writhes the moanin' sea. See whaur in whirlin' shooers they flee, The sprays o' ocean, owre the main! See whaur the leaves o' buss an' tree Gang streamin', streamin' owre the plain! Let's tak' occasion fra the day To triumph owre a thrawart fate, An', ere auld age forbid we may, Assert oor independent state. The wun's that at the wundie beat May tame the tod an' cowe the craw; But we, wha rank a higher rate, Will lauch at Winter's wildest blaw! Bring oot the jorum! there's a drap That should be gurglin' i' the wime o't; An', while the storm flees owre oor tap, We'll toom the cog, an' hae a time o't! A cheerfu' quaich—an' whaur's the crime o't? Or maybe twa—we'll no' get fou! Droon Daddy Care, an' mak' a rhyme o't, An' face the warl' the morn anew! Hughie Flatters Saunders with an Ironical Description of Himself. “Nec si quid olim lusit Anacreon, Delevit ætas.” —Car. iv. 9. I tune my pipe to Doric strains Wi' great gudewill, an' meikle pains, Altho' my skill be like my gains— Baith unco sma'; An' yet a something too remains Ahint the blaw. It's no' for a' the pipin' crew To blaw sic strains as Robbie blew; It's no' for ilka bard to pu' A branch sae green As cleeds wi' laurel Robbie's broo Doun to the een. Yet humbler menstrils hae their meed; There's Allan wi' his rural reed, An' Fergusson, sae fain to lead, Sae sune to fa', An' Jamie Hogg, a border breed, An' Paisley's twa. Forbye the bards that aulder are, Like Barbour, an' the bauld Dunbar, An' Lyndsay—wha in Fife wad daur His name forget? A' haill, an' scarce a hair the waur, An' pipin' yet! Such recompense the Muses gie The Makkars a' in their degree, That neither they themsels' can dee, Nor what they notice; While what they slicht, or dinna see, Quickly forgot is. Brave men were born before the Bruce; An' mony an auld heroic Hoose Has slippit past Oblivion's sluice, An' ne'er a wird o't! They did braw things to little use— We never heard o't! An', therefore, Saunders, when ye gang,— But late may that day be, an' lang!— I promise ye a bur'al sang As sune's we've tint ye, To keep your name amon' the thrang That comes ahint ye. I'll tell them o' your noble heart, An' hoo ye took the puir man's pairt, An' garr'd a greedy rascal smairt, A graspin' cratur'; I'll spread abroad wi' a' my airt Your generous natur'. I'll sing your noble confidence An' trust in man; your common-sense, That lat ye see thro' a' pretence, And smile to see't; I'll sing the virtues that gaed hence When Saunders dee'd. Per Contra.— [Rin, little postscripp, rin an' tell That Saunders as he's drawn's a sell, For Saunders crams into a shell His sordid natur', Cheats, an' distrusts, an' is himsel' The graspin' cratur'!] Hughie's Advice to his Brother John. “Omnes eodem cogimur.” —Car. ii. 3. Dear Jock, ye're higher up the brae Than me, your aulder brither— Keep mind the higher up ye gae The mair ye're in the weather. I'm no' misdootin' that ye're wice, An', for your ploo-share, speed it! But I may better gi'e advice, An' ye may better need it. The higher up the brae ye speel The farrer it's below ye,— Tak' tent ye dinna gi'e the deil Occasion to dounthrow ye. Be douce an' ceevil wi' success, For Fortune's no' to trust aye; Then if your head should tak' the gress, Ye're whaur ye were at first aye. An honest fa', wi' conscience clear, It never brak' a bane yet; There's aye the honest course to steer For a' that's come an' gane yet. But letna lucre be your aim, Pursued thro' thick an' thin aye; The honour o' an honest name, That's what you first should win aye. For happiness (to God be thanks!) Is no' the gift o' Fortun'; Wi' place the limmer plays her pranks, Wi' men like puppets sportin'— Rich folk lookin' idly on At puir folk busy dargin'— But happiness, my brither John, It wasna in the bargain. The ups an' douns o' human life Are like a fairy revel; But a' the warld, an' his wife, Maun lie at ae great level. An' that's a thocht for me an' you When Fate's awards perplex us; In calm eternity's wide view There's little that should vex us. Fate's like the waves beneath the moon, An' we like vessels ridin'; It's up an' doon, an' up an' doon, An' here there's nae abidin'; But on the far horizon's edge, To which we're ever driftin', The changes on Life's pilgrimage Are but a paltry shiftin'. Hughie's Flight as an Eagle. “Jam jam residunt cruribus aspera.” —Car. ii. 20. The bards are birds, an' born to flee! If I were ane, an' choice were free, I'd be an Eagle! wha but he To rule the air! The very sun wi' open ee He can ootstare! His flicht is owre the cluds o' heaven; He screams abune the flashin' levin, That sends the wee fools, terror-driven, Hame when they see't; The heichest hills are thunder-riven Aneth his feet! Nae peer has he; an' wha wad daur The rushin' o' his wings in war? Or seek wi' impious bolt to bar His plumag'd pride? Nae fear has he; his flicht is far, His empire wide. Already doun my sides I feel The feathers creepin'! on my heel A spur sticks oot as sharp as steel! My wings are risin'! I'm ready for the lift! fareweel! I'm aff, bird-guizin'. Wi' ae waff o' my wings I soar A mile abune the city's roar; Then round the globe, shore after shore, Wi' pinions regal, I flee a strang flicht wi' the core, A brither eagle! Homer flees first—for wha wad seek To tak' that honour fra the Greek? Then Pindar wi' triumphant beak An' bluidy talons,— Tho', whyles, he whummles wi' a shriek Clean aff his balance! Then comes a lower flicht, but still Far, far abune oor loftiest hill; Yon's Virgil wi' his weel-preen'd quill Alangside Horace; A band o' Eaglets screamin' shrill Comes next in chorus. But wha is this wi' brunt ee-bree, An' scowther'd on the wings awee? It's Dante: he delichts to flee A' by himsel'. The fire that's in his flamin' ee He stole fra hell! An' yonder, noo, ye may descry Shakespeare an' Milton ridin' by, Dimmin' the haill dome o' the sky, Their ain dominion; While far within their shadow I Streek oot my pinion. But yet it's grand to sail the air Altho' a mile aneth the pair,— To flap your wings owre earthly care, Owre kirk an' steeple, An' see them point Lo here! lo there! The gapin' people. Nae mound nor monument for me! An Eagle-poet canna dee! But when the lightnin' flashes free, The tempest sings, Look up, an' in the tumult see My soarin' wings! Hughie Remonstrates with Davie— a Dour Critic. “Si me lyricis vatibus inseres!” —Car. i. 1. Man, Davie, had I but the art To pierce that stane ye ca' your heart Wi' the clear dart o' poesie, A prooder man there wadna be. For weel it's kent thro' a' the toun That nane can rise that ye ca' doun; While him that by the haund ye tak'— He'll neither fame nor fortune lack; His ballants—thro' the touns they'll cry them, An' weaver bodies rin to buy them. There's twa-three praise me, too, it's true, But what are they when wantin' you? There's Johnny o' the Windyknowe— A blessin' on his auld beld pow! Wi' kindly hail whene'er he meets me He grips me by the haund, an' greets me. “Shakspere!” says Johnnie, “gie's a swatch o't! Weel dune, my bairn! ye hae the catch o't— This dings the lave!” But that's nae test, For aye wi' him the last's the best! There's Geordie, too, my second cousin— His praise is waur to me than pousin; He kens a stirk, but for a sang He's never richt but when he's wrang! There's a few mair that I could name, There's Tam the farrier, an' Jame; But Jame's my brither, an' for Tam— Ye'll buy his judgment wi' a dram. Man, Davie! if ye wad but praise me, Ye wad' as wi' a windlass raise me Oot o' the slough o' doot I'm in, An' set me on a road to rin! Just cast your een abroad an' see Hoo everybody's pleased but me; They've a' some hobby to amuse them, Folk to look on an' frien's to roose them, An' weel contentit there they ride, An' lauch, an' let the warld slide. An' I ana' wad hae my treasure, An' poetry wad be my pleasure, If ye wad only bend your ee An' blink approval ance on me! To be a bandsman pleases some, To toot the horn or beat the drum; Even little Jock that ca's the mangle— Saturday comes, an' the triangle, An' then sae manfu' as he strides An' tingles on its yetlan' sides! An' weel ye ken that Pate Macdougal Wad blaw his soul into a bugle; That thrice thro' jealousy the wife O' Dempster kickit Dempster's fife; An' weel-a-wat the coonty kens When Sandie Brand ca'd oot the brains O' his black fiddle at the fair, An' swore he ne'er wad fiddle mair,— Altho' he “d—d if he was carin',” Sober he sabbit like a bairn! Ithers again for weeks are chammber'd Glowerin' wi' hawks' een on a damberd. Some at the gowfin' spend their leisure; To some the rifle-range gie's pleasure; Quoits or the puttin' stane has charms For steady een an' sturdy arms. O then to see oor noble smith Tak' up the ball to prove his pith! Hark hoo it whizzes thro' the air— He's foremost by an ell or mair. The slater, tae, we maunna slicht,— He drave the pin clean oot o' sicht, An' when wi' shools they howkit for 't, Darkness cam' on, an' spoiled the sport. Nane to this day can understand it— They howkit, but they never fand it! For me—gin I had but the art To pierce that whinstane o' your heart, An' bring the sparkle to your ee— A happier man there wadna be! Noo, Davie, dinna crook your mou'— A wird o' praise is sweet fra you! Hughie in Love with a Shrew. “Urit grata protervitas.” —Car. i. 19. I've nocht to wreak mysel' upon, An' wark I dinna fancy, Sae I'll sit doun an' hae a groan Aboot my cruel Nancy. She thraw'd her head when late yestreen I telt her I was deein'— Either she disna care a preen, Or else she kens I'm leein'. O Nancy, but your hert's as hard An' cauld as kirkyaird granite; 'Deed, whyles I think the nicht ill-starr'd That saw me brak' wi' Janet! She's neither cuist me glance o' grace Nor shown me ceevil favour; The wooer's is a dootfu' case That builds on that behavour! Nae ither lad that awns a dug, But Sandie, ever socht her; She flang a leglen at his lug, As weel's the nits he brocht her. She hasna tried thir tricks on me; She'd find it—no' sae chancy; An' that's what gars me houp to see My waddin'-day wi' Nancy! Hughie's Spring Sunshine dashed wi' Shadow. “Solvitur acris hiems gratâ vice veris et Favoni.” —Car. i. 4. The winter ice is breakin' up, The wast wind whistlin' cracks his whup, An' noo ye hear their Hi! woa! h'up! (Pleasant the hearin'!) As plooman-lads wi' steady grup Draw oot their feerin'. An' now ere lang we'll see the flooers Drawn fra the divots by the shooers, An' saft winds hing the plantin' booers Wi' leaves that rustle, An' lav'rocks to the lift a' 'oors Flee up, an' whistle. It's braw an' blithesome i' the spring To see the joy o' everything: Dance, bairns an' bodies! loup an' sing! Ye dae't wi' reason; Whatever joyous thocht ye bring, It comes in season. Dance while ye can, sing while ye may, For human life's a shortliv'd day; Owre sune, owre sune the gloamin' gray Creeps cauld athort it, An' we at rest oor limbs maun lay Whaur late we sportit! A Weet Hairst: Hughie condoles wi' Saundie. “Aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus.” —Epod. 16. Saundie, my frien'! I ken it's sair, I ken fu' weel your basket's bare, Your store o' savin's toom; I'm wae to see your waefu' looks Oot-ower the fields o' draiglit stooks, An' fodder, fit to soom! Wi' markets cheap and wages dear, Ye've been at mickle cost; An' here's the hervest o' the year, An' a' your labour lost! Perplexin' an' vexin' The ways o' Nature seem; The haste o't, the waste o't, It's like an evil dream! What touch o' comfort can ye feel? It's sad, it's angersome atweel, To think that folk like you, Wha saw'd gude seed in gude dry laund, An' spared nae sweat o' head or haund, In hopes to cairry thro'— Wha watched it fra the wee green breer To Autumn's stately show O' mony a gallant gowden spear In serried rank an' row— Maun see't noo and dree't noo, Lie rottin' i' the rain! The mense o't, the sense o't, Nae mortal can explain! But human reason's but a spark, A can'le's glimmer i' the dark; An' he's the wiser wicht Wha doots his wisdom and his sense, An' puts his trust in Providence Till dawns the dear daylicht. Saundie, my frien'! a bairn-like faith That a'thing's for your gude Will lead ye safe thro' life an' death, Thro' fear o' fire an' flude. Tho' crosses, an' losses, Mar a' the life o' men, They're sent till's; their end till's We'll aiblins ae day ken. Hughie's Advice to Tammie to live less for the Future and more for the Present. “Carpe diem!” —Car. i. 11. Gie owre thae wild uncanny looks, That trokin' wi' the deevil's books, That doctorin' o' yoursel' wi' simples (It only fills your face wi' pimples!), An' learn to live like ither folk Whas' trust is in their aitmeal poke! Ye winna grow ae bit the stranger, Ye winna live ae 'oor the langer, For a' your deep-laid calculations, Your cairds an' left-loof consultations, Your herbs an' drogs, your drinks an' plaisters, An' a' your ither unkent slaisters! Ye'll live nae langer an' nae less Than a' your days, ye maun confess. But surely it's the manlier gate To wait wi' patience on your fate— To sup your parritch, tak' your smoke, An' dee at last like ither folk! This eager wish o' yours to scan The future—will't prolong your span? It's far frae gude, it's doonricht bad, Half-irreligious an' half-mad! What better wad ye be to ken Hoo mony years ye've yet to spen'? For what there's o't ye couldna strengthen 't An' owre the score ye couldna lengthen 't! Ye'd only live a life dementit, An' dee alane an' unlamentit. Tammy, my man! tak' my advice, An' follow 't, an' we'll ca' ye wice: Draw in your hopes, an' keep your fears Commensurate wi' a mortal's years; Enjoy the present—crack your joke An' tak' your dram wi' sober folk, An' dinna grieve the passin' 'oors By wonderin' if the future's yours! Hughie Lectures a Vain Old Maid. “Fis anus, et tamen Vis formosa videri.” —Car. iv. 13. Eh, Nance! this is a sair come-doun; An' ye were ance sae braw, The pridefu'est lass in a' the toon, Coortit by ane an' a! Ay, wumman, at oor time o' life Thae youthfu' memories are rife— Surely ye winna yet maintain Your courtin' days are no by-gane? Ye ken your raven ringlets noo Are grizzle-grey or white, Your een are blear'd that were sae blue An' sparkled sae wi' spite. Wha wad prefer your runkled chaft To rosy Meg's, sae smooth an' saft? An', faith, to ca' your crackit quaver Melodious noo is juist a haver! But bonnie Meg can lilt fu' weel Wi' that bit modest mou', An', while she warbles, whaur's the chiel' Wad lend a lug to you? Ye needna fash to busk yersel', For what ye've on there's nane could tell: Lay by your silks an' pearlins noo, A worset goon's the liker you. Your looks that were sae bauld an' free, Your bloom that was sae bonnie— Ance, an ye mind, they maister'd me; I was as daft as ony! Ay! nane but Bess cam' near ye than,— An' this is Bess's second man, While you—ye're never oot i' bit, An' dressin' like a young lass yet! Autolycus in Glendevon: Hughie falls in with Shakespeare. “Callidum, quidquid placuit, jocoso Condere furto.” —Car. i. 10. A player 's come to Devon banks, An' doun fornenst my door he clanks, An' draws his buskins on; Then up he loups: the gude be near's! The warld at my door appears, An' Devonside stands yon'! Here stalks a king, there slinks a freer, An' fra behint a buss Keeks ane wi' sly todlowrie leer— The loon Autolycus. Deceivin', an' weavin' His wiles wi' ready skill, Yet rantin', an' chantin',— I canna wuss him ill. I pass for honest man mysel', Wi' truth, as far as I can tell; Yet see hoo things come roun',— Some auld forgotten taint o' blude, Some auld forbear's contempt o' gude, Mak's me admire the loon. An' I could hearken till his strain When hawthorn buds appear (Gin I could ca' my lugs my ain) Whil' I had lugs to hear. But deacons, an' beacons O' haly reek and flame, Surround me, an' bound me, An' bid me bide at hame! We're ower sair fash'd wi' righteousness! The warld, I'm sure, wad do wi' less O' that peculiar kind That lies in visage lang an' sour, Uncharitable heart, an' dour An' narrow bigot mind; That weaves a windin'-sheet for mirth, That poisons bread wi' leaven, That herds us fra the joys o' earth, An' fain wad haud's fra heaven! Misca's us, an' thraws us, Hooever it seems fit: We'll blink it, an' jink it, An' tak' oor fling o't yet! Hughie's Views on Soldiering. “Nos proelia virginum Sectis in juvenes unguibus acrium Cantamus.” —Car. i. 6. War's broken oot, an' the toon's wives are skirlin', An' Jock maun awa' to the muster at Stirlin'. A douce lad, Jock, when he lived wi' 's here, Stappin' aboot in his plooman's gear, An' whustlin' blithe on his native braes— But a deevil for fechtin' in scarlet claes! Nae doot he's braw wi' his sabretache White gloves, steel sword, an' a stiff mustache, An' lang strippit-breeks—faith, a strappin' chiel, Wi' a silver spur like a star at his heel! But I'm no' at hame in the haunts o' weir, Wi' its gibbles strange, an' its gibberish queer, Wi' its “limber” here, an' “echelong” there, Its “parks” an' “parades,” an' kens what mair. I'd like very weel to descrive it a' For the sake o' Jock, for he looks sae braw, But I micht gang wrang in a form or a phrase, An' earn Jock's wrath for the rest o' my days. The soger-boys are a sicht to see, But their style o' fechtin' 's no' for me— Wi' their blawin' ye up, an' their ca'in' ye roun', An' their stickin' ye dead when they get ye doun! The only fechtin' I care aboot Is when a Meg wi' her jo fa's oot: She lowses upon him a tinkler jaw An' rugs his hair; an' he bears it a'; An' it's a' made up in an 'oor or twa! Hughie thinks himself now too old for Love. “Nocturnis ego somniis, Jam captam teneo, jam volucrem sequor.” —Car. iv. 1. O haud awa' thae lowin' een! I canna bide their licht; I'm no' sae young as I hae been, Nor near sae strong o' sicht. I'm wearin' near twa score an' ten— It's mair becomin' me To think upon my latter en'; In pity, let me be! There's Sandie wad be liker ye, A dacent honest lad; He's growin' like his nowte awee, But, hoot! he's no' that bad. He's a weel-daein' chield, an' douce, An' wants a wife forbye; An' mind he has a snod bit house, An' twa-three gude milk kye. He'll busk ye juist as braw, nae doot, An' cheaper than anither— He'll hae a gude wheen claes aboot Belangin' to his mither. Then dinna fling awa' your smiles (Ye'd fling whate'er cam' handy At ony o' 's, I've noticed, whyles!) But keep them a' for Sandie. For me, I howp the comin' years Are calmer than I've seen yet; Yet why, ah! why will hidden tears Unbidden fill my een yet? Thee still in dreams by night I view, Thee flying o'er the plain, Thee, cruel Peggy! I pursue O'er rolling seas in vain! Hughie's Indignation at the Conduct of the Absconding Elder. “Mala soluta navis exit alite.” —Car. v. 10. He's aff the kintra at a spang! He's on the sea—they've tint him! The warst o' weather wi' him gang! Gude weather bide ahint him! O for a rattlin' bauld Scots blast To follow an' owretak' him— To screed his sails, an' break his mast, An' grup his ship, an' shak' him. Yet wha was less possessed wi' guile, Or prayed wi' readier unction? He brocht the sweetness o' a smile To every public function. There wasna ane had half the grace Or graciousness o' Peter; There wasna ane in a' the place For the millennium meeter. He's fairly aff, he's stown awa', A wolf that wore a fleece, man! He's cheated justice, jinkit law, An' lauch'd at the policeman. The mission fund, the parish rate, He had the haill control o't; The very pennies i' the plate— He's skirtit wi' the whole o't! It's juist a year—it's no' a year, I'm no' a hair the belder, Since in the Session Chaumer here We made him rulin' elder. An' juist a month as Feursday fell He gat the gold repeater, That in a speech I made mysel' We handit owre to Peter. A bonnie lever, capp'd an' jew'ld Perth never saw the mak' o't, An' wi' his character in goold Engraven on the back o't. He's aff! he's aff wi' a' the spoil, Baith law and justice jinkit! O for a wind o' winds the wale To chase his ship an' sink it! To lift the water like a fleece An' gie him sic a drookin', Whaur on his growf he groans for grace But canna pray for pukin'. Then wash'd owre seas upon a spar, Wi' seaweeds roun' the head o'm, Let neither licht o' sun nor star Shine down upon the greed o'm! But let a shark fra oonderneath, It's jaws wi' hunger tichtenin', Soom round him, shawin' izzet teeth At every flash o' lichtnin'! Till in the end the angry waves Transport him to a distance, To herd wi' wolves an' sterve in caves, An' fecht for an existence! Hughie's Anticipation of Hogmanay Night. “Seu tu querelas sive geris jocos, Seu rixam, et insanos amores, Seu facilem, pia testa, somnum.” —Car. iii. 21. Hoo cam' this bonnie greybeard here, Sae trimly to the time o' year, When folk maun lay 't in, tho' it's dear? But this, I'se wauger, Cost but the buyin' o' the bere An' miss'd the gauger. It's smuggled—faith, I canna doot it! The smell o' peat-reek hings aboot it! But still it's whusky—to dispute it Wad be a sin— Sae wi' the leechence, or withoot it, We'se tak' it in. This verra nicht it's Hogmanay— When Hab an' Rab an' twa-three mae Weel-geizen'd guisers up the brae May be expeckit; An' they maun cake an' caulker hae, Or they're negleckit. An' juist as likly 's no, the folk That brew'd, an' brocht this bonnie crock, An' left it hingin' at my lock, May be amon' them: Surely a mutchkin o' the stock 'S weel wair'd upon them. It's whusky noo; but ere the morn The deil kens what may be i' horn, What acks and antics may be born O' this elixir! The humours o' John Barleycorn— They're a queer mixtur'! Here Willie wi' a warlike ee, There Hab upon his bendit knee, Dave amorous daft, an' Roger ree, An' Patie snorin', An' Geordie wi' his jaws ajee A ballant roarin'! Rab sits an' sulks,—a dour ane Rab! Wee Johnnie gets a gift o' gab; Lang Sandie grows a perfeck blab An' tooms his mind; While Tam, wi' aye the ither sab, Swears he's resign'd. I see them in their various places, Oblivious o' their blacken'd faces; They sit, ae hour the ither chases, Nor think o' risin', Nor hoo John Barleycorn disgraces Them an' their guisin'. At last it comes, the warnin' click The auld clock gi'es afore it strik'; They warstle up, an' i' the nick Roar oot their greetin'; Then Patie's wauken'd wi' a kick, An' skells the meetin'! Hughie upon Human Conduct. “Memento . . . moriture Delli!” —Car. ii. 3. Young man, wha at the gates o' life Are bauldly pushing forward, Forgetna in the fash o' strife That a' your days are order'd. There's mony a quest'on greatly vext, An' mony a truth disputit, But that we a' maun dee s' a text Nae sceptic ever dootit. There's some that groan wi' gather'd cares Like grief-opprest Cassandras, An' some that jig like fules at fairs An' mock like merry-Andros. But hoo should we comport oorsels, As life we journey thro' it? Or wha that kens will rise an' tell 's The wisest way to view it? We'll let that halesome text, as God, There's little doot, design'd it, Come like a caution on the road To keep us even-mindit; To save us in oor prosperous days From insolent offending, An' whisper in the midst o' waes That they too have an ending. It's no' the pairt, but hoo we ack That judgment 'ill be past on; It's no' the red coat nor the black, It's no' what we had last on. That, only that's deservin' praise That we hae dune oor best in; The place is but the player's claes, The conduct is the question. Hughie's Invitation to a Friend in the City. “Hic tibi copie Manabit ad plenum benigno Ruris honorum opulenta cornu.” —Car. i. 17. Noo Nature's wauken'd fra her trance, An' sunbeams owre Lochleven glance, An' soothlan' winds that blaw fra France Bring soothlan' weather, An' lambs like fairy pownies prance Amang the heather. Noo doun the rig the sawer swings, An' Jock ahint the harrow sings; Noo aff his plaid the shepherd flings An' cracks to Rover, While a' the open upland rings To whaup and plover. This mornin' happy man is he That on the Ochils rangin' free Can thro' the blue lift send his ee Owre to the Lomon', An' a' the pleasant prospect see An' envy no man. That happy man—he's no' to seek! That happy man—ye hear him speak! He stands upon an Ochil peak An' looks wi' pity On you that dwall amang the reek Doun i' the city. Nae doot it's there the race is run For walth an' honours, but the fun 'S to them that win, an' tho' ye've won Ye're apt to time them; The glory o' the settin' sun 'Ill far ootshine them! Come, leave awhile the stoory toun, The mill-horse track, the endless roun', The jaded sicht, the jarrin' soun', The haste an' hurry, An' look fra pastoral summits doun On Edinburgh. Here a' your griefs to grund 'ill fa' Like winter's blanket aff a wa' When saft airs owre Damíat blaw, An' skies are clearin'. An' yellow whin-blumes thro' the snaw Are blithely peerin'. Or are ye shilpit, pale, an' sick? Come up the brae an' bide a week, An' drink the pure air at the peak That's nearest heaven, An' get a howp in ilka cheek O' halesome livin'. For what's the worth o' warld's gain Unless the joys o' health remain? Yet there are folk that strive, an' strain Their strength unduly— Wi' puir return for a' their pain, To speak it truly. Note.—Damíat is a conspicuous height of the Ochil range. The Lomonds are a well-known range near Lochleven. Hughie's Belief in Present Duty. “Vina liques, et spatio brevi Spem longam reseces.” —Car. i. 11. It wasna meant that mortal men Should read the deevil's books to ken (What they can never comprehen') The secret o' their hinner en'. The nobler gate o't were to spen' The scriptural threescore years an' ten, Or less or mair, as Heaven may sen', In present duty to the en'. For, let us sum up what we ken; The present—weel, that's oors to spen'; The past—that canna come agen; The future—that's for Heaven to len'. Than this, we'll get nae farrer ben; An' sae, like reasonable men, Let's keep oor hopes within oor ken; An' noo—produce the tappit hen! Pyrrhine Bell: Hughie's old Valentine. “Quis nunc te fruitur credulus aurea?” —Car. i. 5. I Dear Bell,—the name at least is dear, The love was lost langsyne!— Whaur won ye noo? if ane may speer; An' wha's your valentine? That some brisk Donald o' the braes, Or Jockie o' the glen,— That some ane some gate ca's ye his, (God bless the bairn!) I ken. II I'm wae for him, the witless youth, That tak's her passin' whim; An' yet, if I maun speak the truth, I halflins could be him! For wha wad guess a cruel heart Controll'd that witchin' ee? Or that those gleesome airs were airt? But cuissen lads like me! III That some ane some gate has her heart, (God save the mark!) I ken; There never yet was handsome flirt But had her wale o' men. An', troth! if truth were in her kiss, An' true love in her smile, She weel micht merit—what she hiz, The livin' warld to wyle! IV Puir unkent brither, whustlin' blithe Wi' firm belief in Bell, As lang as simmer-glances kythe, Enjoy them for theirsel'! An' bide the winter when it comes As bravely as ye may! What needs a man forecast the glooms To tak' them ere their day? Hughie's Enjoyment of Summer in Glendevon. “Per meos fines, et aprica rura Lenis incedas, abeasque parvis Æquus alumnis.” —Car. iii. 18. Sweet Simmer, to the pastur' come That slopes to Devon banks, And with thee bring the gairie's hum, And earn a shepherd's thanks. For Grecian plains I do not mourn, Nor streams of Castalee; Blink on the banks where I was born, And that's eneu' for me. Sweet Simmer, by oor banks abide And blink on Devon burn; And late depart from Devonside With promise of return. Then fairy fancies wing'd wi' rhyme Across my path shall pass, With wild bees from the beds of thyme, And laverocks from the grass. What whiter gowans wait thy smile On foreign buchtit braes? What swanker shepherds?—sad the while Thy lingering step delays. Here gowden blooms on hill-taps burn, And daisies pearl the lea, And Devon toys in mony a turn From wedding with the sea. Sweet Simmer, by oor banks abide, And prove to warl'y men That, gang they far or gang they wide, There's peace around the pen; That yet the golden age delays Of which they only dream, Wi' shepherd folk on Ochil braes By Devon's gentle stream. Hughie seeks to console a Brother Shepherd, over-grieving for the Loss of his Son. “Non semper imbres.” —Car. ii. 9. It's no' aye rainin' on the misty Achils, It's no' aye white wi' winter on Nigour; The winds are no' sae mony sorrowin' Rachels, That grieve, and o' their grief will no' gie owre. Dark are Benarty slopes, an' the steep Lomon' Flings a lang shadow on the watter plain; But fair Lochleven's no' for ever gloomin', An' Devon's no' aye dark wi' Lammas rain. The birks tho' bare, an' the sune-naked ashes, Not always widow'd of their leaves appear; The oaks cry oot beneath November's lashes, But not for all the months that mak' the year. Comes round a time, comes round at last tho' creepin', And green and glad again stand buss an' tree; E'en tender gowans, thro' the young gress peepin', Rise in their weakness, and owre-rin the lea. Thus Nature sorrows, and forgets her sorrow; And Reason soberly approves her way: Why should we shut oor een against to-morrow Because our sky was clouded yesterday? Dear Adie!—for we've lang kent ane anither, Tendin' oor flocks upon the selfsame hill, And if I speak as brither should to brither, Ye'll neither turn awa' nor tak' it ill,— It's now three year since little Adie left us: He was, to every ane that kenn'd him, dear: Adam! it was the will of God bereft us, Call'd him away, and left the lave o's here. Three years ye've sorrow'd for the little laddie; It clouds your broo, I hear it when ye speak; And thrice I've seen, when ithers sawna, Adie, The sudden tear upon your wasted cheek. Ye nurse your sorrow in the cheerfu' morning, Ye nurse it, too, at unavailing eve; Our rustic gatherings, with a silent scorning, And all our rural sports and joys ye leave. Sorrow is sacred, but this sair insistance, This lang refusal to Heaven's will to boo, Consider, Adie; is't a wise resistance? You'll go to him, he canna come to you. And, since you go to meet him, go not sadly, For the short half o' life that yet remains: You love your son—go then to meet him gladly On that appointed day which Heaven ordains. Hughie at the Smiddy—A Dramatic Idyll. “Ille terrarum mihi præter omnes Angulus ridet.” —Car. ii. 6. Part I. The Smithy—Evening. Smith. Three Ploughmen. Enter Hugh. Hugh —Noo, billies, ken ye what's the steer?1st Ploughman—Dave's listed.2nd Ploughman— Lowrie's on the beer.3rd Ploughman—Nick's cut his throat.Hugh— The gude be here, An' guard an' bless us! There's scandal for a lang loup-year— Gie owre your guesses! Blacksmith, ye'll mind o' Geordie Sym— He cam' the day!Smith— Lang Geordie?Hugh— Him.Smith—I mind him weel—lang, lowse, an' slim; The wind could bend him.Hugh—Ay; but he's back in ither trim Than ance we kenn'd him.Smith—What's that?Hugh— Ou, brawny, big, an' weel; Beard like a buss, kite like a creel, As roond an' soond as ony wheel Ye ever chappit,— A buirdly, business, wice-like chiel As ever stappit.Smith—An' weel pat on?Hugh—The best o' claith; Coat, breeks—the wast o' England baith; An' gowd—1st Pl.— Noo, Hughie, tak' a breath2nd Pl.—An' gie's 't in plenty!3rd Pl.— Ca't thoosan's!Hugh— Weel, I'll tak' an aith At least it's twenty.1st Pl.—Gude measure!2nd Pl.— Lippin'!3rd Pl.— To the brim!Smith—An' wha's he this? Lang Geordie Sym? This man o' size an' substance, him That aye gaed fleein'? 'Faith, Hughie, ye're in famous trim The nicht for leein'! Come, steer aboot! wha's aucht this gear? What's wantit wi' the sock-neb here?1st Pl.—Mair laund. A chap or twa wad near Do a' that's wantit.Smith—Hughie, we'll no' juist ca' ye lear— Tak' it for grantit!Hugh—That's ceevil! Weel, it's what I ken That Geordie's rich amon' rich men, Has siller baith to spare an' spen', An' speaks forbye O' flocks at the far warl's en', An' droves o' kye. His farm's a coonty, an' his sheep The coonty boun's can hardly keep; He says a telescope micht sweep His ootmost border, But ae inch owre it couldna peep, Tho' made to order! An' then his sheep—2nd Pl.— Wow! but it's graund To hear o' sic a sicht o' laund! What say ye, chaps? we'll mak' a baund, An' owre the ocean!1st Pl.—But hoolie! an' let's understaund— Whaur's this new Goshen?Hugh—It's on the underside i' warl'—Smith—Ay, man? Hoo dae they stick?Hugh— Daft carle! This earth's a kind o' whirlin' barr'l, Some up, some under; It's time aboot wi' ilka wharl, An' whaur's the wonder? Owstralia's up when Scotland's doun, An' that's when we're a' sleepin' soun', But i' the nicht time we're ca'd roun', An' i' the mornin' We're up, an' at oor wark, to croon The day's adornin'!3rd Pl.—Man, Hughie, but ye've rowth o' wirds, They carve the subjec'-theme like swirds— Tell us what kin' o' beas' an' birds Live thereawa'.2nd Pl.—An' what they gie their hinds an' herds.1st Pl.— Just oot wi't a'.Hugh—Weel, first, they've neither craws nor doos, But craturs they ca' cockatoos; An' then for beas', they've kangaroos An' aborigins; The folk's a mixtur', I jaloose, O' a' religions, But brithers a'—there's nae pretence; An' then the kintra's sae immense, Ye'll get a farm at sma' expense, An' hoose to sleep in; In fac', ye juist rin oot your fence An' ca' your sheep in. There's nane to steer ye whaur ye sattle. An' there they breed like Jacob's cattle, Till to the boun's they spread an' sprattle, Then—owre they rin Whaur neither fence o' wire nor wattle Can haud them in. O then what muntin' an' what ridin' The gressy wildernesses wide in, To herd the flocks that winna bide in, An' keep them clear! There's nae sic guardin' or sic guidin' O' cattle here. The shepherds i' the saiddle sleep, The plains are populous wi' sheep, The haill horizon seems to creep, An' far ayont it They haena even time to keep The cattle coontit! Owre a' the region, far an' near, There's bleatin' there, an' baain' here; Then comes the crap-time o' the year When packs are made up, An' gowpenfu's o' gowden gear Are snugly laid up. In this way lang lowse Geordie even Has grown a man o' means, an' thriven, Staunds twa ell straucht, an' lifts to heaven A half-ell beard, An' looks as life-like an' as livin' As ony laird. Part II. Smithy as before. Later evening. Smith. Hugh. Three Ploughmen. Outside at half-door, a Tall Stranger, with a half-ell beard, leading a Saddle-horse. Tall Stranger—Who owns this hole? Holloa there—you! Blacksmith or blackguard!Smith— What's ado?Hugh—It's him! it's Geordie!Tall St.— Horse to shoe! And look out—there's 't! (Quoiting in the iron.)Smith—Man, folk hae time to dicht their mou' I' th' heat o' hairst! Ca' in your naig! (Enter Tall Stranger.)Hugh— It's Maister Sym! Noo, blacksmith, say 't!Smith— Hughie, it's him! 'Faith, sir, ye come in ither trim Than ance I've kent ye—Sym—That's years ago!Smith— —lang, lowse, an' slim! Ay, sir, it's twenty!Sym—Twenty?—a hundred! You don't know How much your country clock's gone slow. Well, Hugh? What is't to be then? Go? Or stay and sterve here? “Ay” means—well, look at me! And “no,” For ever serve here. I leave, and soon; and not again To seek old Scotland o'er the main; My home's on yon Australian plain, My hopes are yonder; Why, man, a county breadth's my ain— What needs your wonder? What has old Scotland done for me?Hugh—At least she ga'e ye brains.Sym— May be!Hugh—An' banes; an' bu'k.Sym— Na—that's a lee, The hin'most half o't! The shank she ga'e me for a thie, I made a staff o't! Well, and what else? No more, I trow, But hip-room on a thistly knowe, Or scartin' rocks ahint a plow, For a rich neighbour— Out yonder, lads, there's room to grow, An' wealth for labour! Take my advice—ye'll ne'er repent it; Your country's yonder if ye kent it; There's Burn-the-wind—he's nearhand faintit Ca'in' a shoe on! At his age yonder—Smith— He's contentit; Be joggin' you on! There stands your naig.Sym (giving silver)— And there's your pay. So, Hughie, you elect to stay— Well, wilful man will have his way. Good-bye—but think on't. (Mounts and rides off.) Smith (looking into his loof)— A croon!1st Pl.— He rides a bonnie gray.Smith— We'se ha'e a drink on't!(Boy at bellows despatched with pig.)2nd Pl.—He'd gar ye troo it was a wrang To breathe in Scotland.3rd Pl. (to Hugh)— Will ye gang?Hugh—I've lo'ed auld Scotland far owre lang, Heart-thirled till her! An' what's the gospel o' his sang But only siller? Na, na! that wasna in the plan, That's no' the great chief end o' man, It's no' get a' the gear ye can An' syne content ye; But lift what's lyin' to your han'— Aneu's a plenty. As sweet to me amang the knowes, Whaur Devon's caller current rows, To lead the lambs an' ca' the yowes As to commaund them; As sweet to view the hechts an' howes As if I awn'd them. Nae fairer warl' I wuss to view, Nae loftier path wad I pursue, Nae trustier friends than you, an' you, I care to hae; An' here I wad gang slippin' thro', E'en as I dae. Here as my mortal hopes expire, And ilka earth-born dear desire Dees oot, as dees the desert fire, Let tranquil age Attend me thro' the creepin' tire O' life's last stage. Here let the sicht o' hill an' field The fragrance o' my youth-time yield; Here let me totter doun to eild, An' find a grave here— What ither than a gowany bield Amang the lave here? Nae pomp nor passion there appear, But winds the growin' laurel steer, An' solitary friends draw near At antern times To drap a saut but silent tear Owre Hughie's rhymes! Hughie moralises on the Value of Life. “Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume, Labuntur anni!” —Car. ii. 14. Alas! alas! my fellow feres, We may no more deny The pressure of the speeding years; Oor days are driving by. Already on the downward track The posting furies fare; For virtuous life they will not slack, For purpose will not spare. This is the ill beneath the sun That vexes ageing men— Oor lease of life is half-gate run Before of lease we ken. We waste or ware oor strength of youth On idols of the ee, Infidel of the wholesome truth Of our mortalitie. Ye callants, what avails the strife That twyns ye o' your prime? The dearest gift of life is life, The dearest enemy time. O ne'er can rank or wealth enhance The gift that ne'er was awn, The lovely gift, the glorious chance, Ance offer'd, sune withdrawn! To them that on the shaded slope Are faring down, like me, With ever daily dwining hope, How fair it tak's the ee! What had been oors from hour of birth We learn to value then; Sweet grow the common joys of earth, And dear the face of men. Hughie on Evictions: he Lectures a Greedy Landlord. “Non ebur neque aureum.” —Car. ii. 18. Nae pillars rise at my door-cheeks, Nae plate adorns my door; The sun that through my window keeks Sees but a sanded floor. Nae cock-laird, sick an' sweir to dee, Bans me, his far-aff heir; Nae auld maid sets her mutch at me— In stockings, mony a pair. But common-sense and a sma' cast O' country wit are mine, And friendly critics, east an' wast, Cry up my rustic line. Nae better fortune would I ken For comfort or for pride, Blest wi' a shepherd's but-an'-ben High up on Ochilside. My lease o' life is half-gate through, And I'm contented weel To roam about, e'en as I do, With Rover at my heel. Alas! the emblems of our state, Where'er we turn, appear: Day shouthers day ayont the gate, And moons round aff the year. Yet you, wha's pride disdains to sell, Wha's greed is still to buy, Forgetfu' o' the narrow cell Where you maun erelang lie; You, sir, wha spin not, nor hae cause, Or toil—but where's the use? Are barin' quarries, biggin' wa's, And adding ha' to hoose. And what is this of tyrant's grup, And puir men's rights opposed, Of landmarks lifted, paths ploughed up, And commonty enclosed? Man, wife, an' bruckit bairns maun pack, An' go at your command; Wi' kist an' bundle on their back, They're hundit aff the land. You spurn the cottar from his cot, The cottage from the green; And where the poor man's home was not, Your high ha' door is seen. But there's a Ha' wha's door is sma', To which a' backs maun boo; And this great Ha' that waits us a', Awaits baith them an' you. Hughie marks with delight the Return of Spring. “Diffugere nives.” —Car. iv. 7. Noo swallow-birds begin to big, An' primrose-flooers to blaw; An' Jockie whistles doun the rig A fareweel to the snaw; An' glints o' sunshine, glancin' gleg, Licht up the buddin' shaw; An' westlin' winds are playin' tig Round ae bewildered craw. Auld Tammas to the gavle-wa' Nails up a cherry twig; An' Mar'an waters, raw by raw, Her bleachin' wi' a pig; An' yonder—he's been lang awa'— Comes Packie owre the brig; An' country lads may noo gang braw, An' country lasses trig. Hughie's Friend, the Farmer of Westerha'. “In reducta valle mugientium Prospectat errantes greges.” —Epod. 2. Aboon the braes I see him stand, The tapmost corner o' his land, An' scan wi' care, owre hill an' plain, A prospect he may ca' his ain. His yowes ayont the hillocks feed, Weel herdit in by wakefu' Tweed, An' canny through the loan his kye Gang creepin' to the byre doun by. His hayfields lie fu' smoothly shorn, An' ripenin' rise his rigs o' corn; A simmer's e'enin' glory fa's Upon his homestead's sober wa's. A stately figure there he stands, An' rests upon his staff his hands,— Maist like some patriarch of eld, In sic an e'enin's calm beheld. A farmer he of Ochilside, For worth respeckit far an' wide; A friend of justice and of truth, A favourite wi' age an' youth. There's no' a bairn but kens him weel, And ilka collie's at his heel; Nor beast nor body e'er had ocht To wyte him wi' in deed or thocht. Fu' mony a gloamin' may he stand Aboon the braes to bless the land! Fu' mony a simmer rise an' fa' In beauty owre his couthie ha'! For peacefu' aye, as simmer's air, The kindly hearts that kindle there; Wha's friendship, sure an' aye the same, For me mak's Westerha' a hame. Hughie's Letter of Invitation to the Laird, Entangled by Business or Pleasure in the Town. “Omitte mirari beatæ Fumum et opes strepitumque Romæ.” —Car. iii. 29. Dear laird, although the house be sma', A but-an'-ben the sum o't a', It hauds a drap o' usquebau' As clear's a bead, And aye, whene'er ye like to ca', A welcome wi' 'd. Ye're busy, laird; but what's the need? It canna be the love o' greed; It ne'er was in your father's creed: Come up, an' bide, An' see the flocks how fine they feed On Ochilside. Country and Town are badly pair'd, Like Samson and Delila, laird; She hauds her victims by the beard, As weel she can do 'd. Till in the limmer's lap, I'm fear'd, They lose their manheid. But three mile oot, or aiblins fowre, The vile enchantress has nae power; In vain her glance, in vain her glower; A nobler bliss Begins to act that very hour— The country's kiss. Pure air wi' whin and hawthorn sweet, Clear burns that bathe the mountain's feet, The hills on high, the heavens complete, The far-aff seas— Can streets an' chimla-pats compete Wi' charms like these? Tell nane. an' tak' nae fareweel grip; Just rise, an' gie the town the slip; Get in your hand your ridin' whip, And up the brae Try Dandy's mettle till your hip 'S as black's a slae! Then, like a king that wears a crown, On hills that are your ain look roun'; An' lead the life a' lives aboon In God's daylicht; And in a shepherd's hut sleep soun' The solid nicht! Hughie Watches the Growth of the Grain. “Segetis certa fides meæ.” —Car. iii. 16. The seed was sawn at Hallowmas, Amang the wind an' weet; An' sad at heart the farmer was To fling't amang his feet. Then blew the bitter frosty wund, The last leaf left the tree, An' daisies to the frozen grund Laid their wee heads to dee. But there's a kindness owre us a': Heaven sent its blankets doun, An', 'neath the covering o' the snaw, The seed it sleepit soun'. An' still it sleepit, deaf an' dumb As are the kirkyaird dead, While Boreas threshed his battle-drum, An' thundered overhead. Alas! it was the wildest bit O' a' the widowed year: Save ghaistly mune, or poacher's fit, Nae visitor cam' near. At last the time o' life cam' round Where it lay sleepin' warm, An' timidly abune the ground It reached a tiny arm. It rose; and to the sun so free Stood shivering like a child, That, naked on its mother's knee, Looks round to one that smiled. But Winter's reign was not yet done; And skies gat overcast, And strife across the troubled sun In fitful tumult past. The East sent many a withering blight, The North sent hail an' rain; Yet still it twinkled to the light, And, trembling, rose again. It seemed endowed wi' many lives To meet its many foes, For still, from blasts that nipt like knives Altho' it shrank, it rose. And still it braved the Winter's blast, An' tholed the Winter scorn; And April kindness kissed at last The persevering corn! An' now a stately stalk it rear'd That took the farmer's ee; An' bore a gallant head and beard That flourished fair to see. An', rustling, waving, doun the rig It sported and it sprang; While swallows glanced abune at tig, An' laverocks soared an' sang. Then golden days, an' farmers' praise, John Barleycorn, were thine; And lovers' walks, and whispered talks By moonlight, more divine! Hughie Celebrates his Fiftieth Year. “Festo quid potius die faciam? Prome reconditum Cæcubum.” —Car. iii. 28. This nicht I'm fifty,—fifty, Bess! Gang ben the hoose an' ripe the press, An', what ye find o' whisky, fess Soberly oot: This nicht we'll hae a social gless An' sang aboot. When I was twenty I was tauld When I was fifty I was auld: I'm fifty oot, yet I'll be bauld, Laird o' the truth, To swear I'm just as yap an' yauld As e'er was youth. At fifty, wi' a conscience clear, The man that sits, as I do here, Hand-haill an' neither slow to steer Nor quick to tire, An' wi' that spark to poets dear O' Nature's fire,— He's no' to maen! He's at the stage, The table-land o' middle age; Nae langer on life's pilgrimage Grumblin' an' gropin', But, backward, it's a pictured page, Forward, it's open. He's past the braes; he's at the bit Where ane may ware his gaithered wit And, though his daily burden's yet A heavy load, He travels on a surer fit A smoother road. The fore-nicht flees—Time plies his saw; The pendulum of a wag-at-the-wa' clock. See where he stoops against the wa', Toilin' wi' measured rise an' fa' In silent rage! Thus eats he through life's seasons a', Youth, manheid, age! Let's see! what's left fra last New Year? Hand up the crock!—a chappin clear! Gude luck an' luxury be here, An' a side-saidle! But this is mair than sober cheer,— It means the ladle! And, efter a', the nicht's a youth! Bring oot the bowl—we'll mak' the drouth! But roar for help—there's Aury Struth An' Davie Dinn— Doun to the brae—head wi' your mouth An' cry them in! Wi' the great enemy o' life We'll wage this e'en a merry strife; We mayna stop his nickit knife, But there's the soond— The deil be in my thrapple gif We dinna droon'd! Wi' sowp an' sang we'se fill oor mouth, The e'enin's only in its youth,— It's only aucht o'clock in truth, An' there it's chappin': We'll drink according to our drouth— Pour every drap in! Hughie's Song in Praise of the Simple Joys of Boyhood. “Puræ rivus aquæ.” —Car. iii. 16. O when I was a laddie, noo a lang time back, I hadna mony pennies, but for joys I didna lack: Gie me a Simmer Saturday, my wishes were complete Wi' a lang day before me an' Devon at my feet. I never was an angler, exceppin' in a sense; To be a son of Izaak's I couldna mak' pretence; But I had a fishin'-gad, and was very happy wi't, Wi' a lang day before me an' Devon at my feet. I never killed a saumon: the utmost o' my tak' Was half-a-dizzen spatties in the basket on my back; But ance I raised a noble fish—and was content to see't Wi' a lang day before me an' Devon at my feet. O what cared I for catchin' fish for greed or yet for game? To mak' a bag or mak' a brag was never yet my aim: The fishin' was a mere pretence to win the larger treat O' a lang day before me an' Devon at my feet. There was a sense o' freedom then, that siller canna buy; There was a joy o' living, wi' the sun high in the sky; A day was immortality! an' livin' was sae sweet Wi' a lang day before ye an' Devon at your feet. O we may toil for riper joys an' mair substantial gain, But the simple joys o' laddiehood were easy to attain; Noo for the laddie's simple joys the man amaist could greet— For the lang day that's gane for aye, an' Devon at his feet! Hughie's Letter to a Prosperous Friend. “Bene est, cui deus obtulit Parcâ, quod satis est, manu.” —Car. iii. 16. Dear fellow-pilgrim in the vale, Why should ye langer weep and wail? Your health is gude, your hands are hale, Your conscience free— Deil hae't if onything ye ail Nae mair than me. Ye've loyal sons; ye've lasses braw, Four dainty blossoms fragrant a'— Lang may they brighten hearth and ha', Yours or anither's! Heaven's blessing on their beauty fa', And on their brithers! The warld has favoured ye: your schemes Werena the bonnie baseless dreams That lure, an' loup to wild extremes, To land i' Puirhouse; But solid as the wa's an' beams O' Warks an' Warehouse. Yet wealth brings rarely heart-of-ease: Even he, wha, if his lairdship please, In coach-an'-pair, wi' hands on knees, Can saftly ride, May envy Jock his bread-an'-cheese At yon dyke-side. He's king wha bears a level mind Strengthened by truth, by love refined, In brotherhood with all mankind, And, for the rest, To Heaven's high will serene resigned, And self-possest! What though by Fortune he's bereft? Tak', limmer, fra him wi' your left Whate'er your richt hand gave o' gift!— He'll mak' a fend In honest poverty to shift On to the end. Hughie Directs the Rejoicings for the Queen's Jubilee. “Sera in cœlum redeas diuque Læta intersis populo Quirini!” —Car. i. 2. Ye that are lords o' fixed degree, Ye that are lords by whylies; Ye proveses o' rank, an' ye That are but baron-bailies; Ye members o' the shires an' broughs, Win up, an' haud ye ready To boo your backs an' crook your houghs Afore your sovran leddy! Ye ministers; an' men o' weir— Peace sodgers an' land sailors, Auld warriors, to the service dear, An' young anes, dear to tailors; Ye new-made knichts an' nobles a',— She made ye men o' honour,— Weel may ye rank up in a raw, An' shower your thanks upon her! Ye waiting dames, sae dink an' braw Wi' lades o' costly claithing; Ye bonnie lasses, best o' a' Wi' just a flow'r—or naething; Ye office wands; an' flunkey lords; An' pages, pouthered meetly, Noo hald a tight grip o' the cords, An' guide the course discreetly! Ye college dons, fra proctor doun To him that but professes, Noo, noo's the time to tuck your goun An' draw up your addresses: An' let your Latin be as snug As if she kent the round o't, For, by my faith, she'll lend a lug An' judge ye by the sound o't! Ye parsons, groanin' aye wi' griefs, The warld's maybe mendin'; Ye lawyers, lay aside your briefs, Ill-named—they ne'er have endin'; An' tak' the hills or tak' the dales As wide as e'er ye wandered, Like laddies broken fra the schules, An' free o' stripe an' standard! An' lastly, ye that flood the street, A roarin' spate o' people, Splashed up to wa' an' window-seat, To chimla-stack an' steeple,— It sets ye weel to mak' the din Ye may indulge the morn, June 21, 1887. But dinna loup oot o' your skin, And be content wi' roar'n'! POSTSCRIPT. Ye hills, sune to be blazin' hie, As if by lightning smitten; Ye countries, scattered owre the sea, That mak' the Greater Britain, Shout, and shine oot! tell a' that speir, Wi' a' the speed ye may noo, That, after towlin' fifty year, Our Queen tak's holiday noo! Hughie Lectures the Local Editor, gone abroad on Leave and enjoying himself. “Pollicitus meliora!” —Car. i. 29. Fra whaur, in search o' Simmer air, Southward amang the frem'd ye fare, Till in a sark, or little mair, Ye gang stravaigin',— Come hame an' fill your vacant chair, Ye shameless pagan! We've traced ye to the banks o' Nile; Our een's been on ye a' the while; And, though at times ye've raised the smile, Referring to certain “Letters from Egypt.” We've thocht again— “The dog!” we've said, “is this his style When aff the chain?” The ease of Eastern life, the bliss, Ye've seen't: ye've said, “How fair it is!” Ye've greetit Egypt wi' a kiss, Voluptuous taed! What saftenin' o' the heart was this? And o' the heid? Her flowin' dress o' divers hue, Her glowin' een, her meltin' mou'— Hoo has the glamour o' the view Played to befule ye! A towmont o' the kilt, I troo, Ye'll need to cule ye! Come back, an' tak' a winter tour Amang the snaws on Rannoch moor; Or, better, listen for an 'oor To John M'Caskill: Ae dose o' him's the only cure For you, ye rascal! He'll cure ye o' your rovin' een; He'll tell ye whaur your thochts hae been; He'll purge your mind an' morals clean, An' scour your passions; Till ye renounce the Egyptian queen An' a' her fashions! A Wet Day: Hughie's Pity for the Tinklers. The mist lies like a plaid on plain, The dyke-taps a' are black wi' rain, A soakit head the clover hings, On ilka puddle rise the rings. Sair dings the rain upon the road,— It dings, an' nae devallin' o'd; Adoun the gutter rins a rill Micht halflins ca' a country mill. The very roadman's left the road: The only kind o' beas' abroad Are dyucks, rejoicin' i' the flood, An' pyots, clatterin' i' the wud. On sic a day wha tak's the gate? The cadger? maybe; but he's late. The carrier? na! he doesna flit Unless, D.V., the pooers permit. On sic a day wha tak's the gate? The tinkler, an' his tousie mate; He foremost, wi' a nose o' flint, She sour an' sulky, yards ahint. A blanket, fra her shouthers doun, Wraps her an' a' her bundles roun'; A second rain rins aff the skirt; She skelps alang through dub an' dirt. Her cheeks are red, her een are sma', Her head wi' rain-draps beadit a'; The yellow hair, like wires o' bress, Springs, thrivin' in the rain, like gress. Her man an' maister stalks in front, Silent mair than a tinkler's wont; His wife an' warkshop there ahint him,— This day he caresna if he tint them. His hands are in his pouches deep, He snooves alang like ane in sleep, His only movement's o' his legs, He carries a' aboon like eggs. Sma' wecht! his skeleton an' skin, And a dour heavy thocht within. His claes, sae weel wi' weet they suit him, They're like a second skin aboot him. They're doun the road, they're oot o' sicht; They'll reach the howff by fa' o' nicht, In Poussie Nancy's cowp the horn, An' tak' the wanderin' gate the morn. They'll gie their weasands there a weet, Wi' kindred bodies there they'll meet, Wi' drookit gangerels o' the clan, The surgeons o' the pat an' pan. Already on the rain-washed wa' A darker gloom begins to fa': Sooms fra the sicht the soakin' plain,— It's closin' for a nicht o' rain. Hughie's Version of the Sitting Member's Address. Electors by the Norlan' Firth, Your wisdom's equal to your wirth; Ye chose me at a whip o' dearth To represent ye! I've ta'en a firmer grip i' yearth Since first I kent ye. Wow! but this warld's a canty hole Surveyed by him that heads a poll, Wha's friends without a murmur thole His capers mony, An' crack him up till, like a coal, He's bleezin' bonnie! What, what had I to win your favours When Damheid, for my misbehavours, Maist like an auld cask dung to stavers, Despatched me rowin', Wi' deil ha'et but a tongue an' slavers To start anew on? By this, I micht hae been forgotten, My public reputation rotten, Gien ower to eild and anecdotin'; Or, at the best, Wi' handbag round the counties trottin' In fruitless quest. While here I am, this braw November, Lookin' again to be your Member, Nae fossil auld, nor brunt-oot ember, But het an' smokin'; Wi' promises—which, please remember, May a' be broken! Nae doot it's feckly wrang to lee; But then, lang-windit naigs like me Maun rin baith hand an' helter free As Nature teaches; An', wantin' whids, whaur wad they be, My bonnie speeches? Whiddin's an airt: ye tak your aith; Ye promise “that's as sure as death”; Ye rap it oot to get a breath Or hide a stammer; A kind o' wild rhetoric wreath, It decks your grammar! I keep my promise when I can; But, if I state, an' stick my plan, What waur am I than ony man That's changed his mind? He's wiser noo than he was than, An' that ye'll find. Sae dinna wonder nor repine, Gude, far-aff, faithfu' friends o' mine, If noo-an'-than I seem to tyne Regaird for truth; And oh! preserve the cordial twine That binds us baith! Hughie in Praise of the Native Brew. Nice-gabbit Fortune, wi' her wines, And a' thing braw aboot her!— The ware that on my dresser shines Is hamely pig an' pewter. Yet wha, in gold or siller cup, For foreign drink wad hanker, If bauld John Barleycorn fill up His toddy-bowl or tankar'? It's braw, nae doot, to read aboot A vine-clad skelp o' mountain, Wi' pendants purpling lika shoot In clusters past a' countin'; Yet beardit John will hauld his ain Wi' Bacchus and his vine-trees, Whether wide-racing owre the plain Or resting on the gantrees He shaws, in sooth, as braw a youth Wi' awns on end, or nae beard; But see him stoor, in pith mature, Bedeckit wi' a grey-beard! O fair is ilka youthfu' thing: But mair than half their beauty Lies in the promise o' their Spring, The Harvest o' their duty. The townsman airtin' to the hills Does weel to charge his pistol; But what avails to geizened gills A toom bedizened crystal? Will siller stopper mend his drouth, Or recommend the liquor? Gie me the neat, the naked truth, And never mind the bicker! It's no' upon the ware ye think When weary for a waught o't; It's no' the veshel that ye drink When takin' doun a draught o't: Let but the caup be clean an' fou— There's naething mair anent it, Unless it be weel-pleased to view The fair hands that present it! Gie foreign wights their foreign wines, The produce o' their country; And let abee the ware that shines On sideboards o' the gentry. Auld Nature turns the tap for a', Wherever men are plantit; And, by her gude an' gracious law, We hae the browst we wantit. Hughie's Monument. “Non omnis moriar.” —Car. iii. 30. In vain the future snaps his fangs; The tyke may rage, he canna wrang's; I put my hand upon my sangs Without a swither; To me this monument belangs, I need nae ither! It's no' in granite to endoor; Sandstane comes ripplin' doun like stoor; Marble, it canna stand the shoo'r, It lasts nae time: There's naething yet has half the poo'r O' silly rhyme. The pyramids hae tint their tale, It's lang since they begoud to fail,— They're either murlin' doun to meal Or fog-enwrappit; While Horace at this hour's as hale As e'er he stappit! Sae I may say 't without a lee I dinna a'thegither dee; Therefore forbear to greet for me When I'm awa'; And keep a dry, a drouthy ee, I charge ye a'. When at my door the hearse draws up, And Kate hands roun' the dirgy-cup, Nae friend o' mine will tak' a sup For that the less, But calmly wi' a sober grup Cowp owre his gless. The better part o' me remains! Where Allan water weets the plains, An' Devon, crystal but for rains, Gangs wandering wide, Lang after me ye'll hear my strains On Ochilside.</field>
