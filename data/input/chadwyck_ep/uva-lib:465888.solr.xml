      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION (Edinburgh Edition, 1787) TO THE NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CALEDONIAN HUNT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume I KILMARNOCK 1786 THE TWA DOGS A Tale 'Twas in that place o' Scotland's isle That bears the name of auld King Coil, Upon a bonie day in June, When wearing thro' the afternoon, Twa dogs, that were na thrang at hame, Forgathered ance upon a time. The first I'll name, they ca'd him Cæsar, Was keepit for ‘his Honor's’ pleasure: His hair, his size, his mouth, his lugs, Shew'd he was nane o' Scotland's dogs; But whalpit some place far abroad, Whare sailors gang to fish for cod. His lockèd, letter'd, braw brass collar Shew'd him the gentleman an' scholar; But tho' he was o' high degree, The fient a pride, nae pride had he; But wad hae spent an hour caressin, Ev'n wi' a tinkler-gipsy's messin; At kirk or market, mill or smiddie, Nae tawted tyke, tho' e'er sae duddie, But he wad stan't, as glad to see him, An' stroan't on stanes an' hillocks wi' him. The tither was a ploughman's collie, A rhyming, ranting, raving billie, Wha for his friend an' comrade had him, And in his freaks had Luath ca'd him, After some dog in Highland sang, Was made lang syne—Lord knows how lang. He was a gash an' faithfu' tyke, As ever lap a sheugh or dyke. His honest, sonsie, baws'nt face Ay gat him friends in ilka place; His breast was white, his tousie back Weel clad wi' coat o' glossy black; His gawsie tail, wi' upward curl, Hung owre his hurdies wi' a swirl. Nae doubt but they were fain o' ither, And unco pack an' thick thegither; Wi' social nose whyles snuff'd an' snowkit; Whyles mice an' moudieworts they howkit; Whyles scour'd awa' in lang excursion, An' worry'd ither in diversion; Till tir'd at last wi' monie a farce, They sat them down upon their arse, An' there began a lang digression About the ‘lords o' the creation.’ CÆSAR I've aften wonder'd, honest Luath, What sort o' life poor dogs like you have; An' when the gentry's life I saw, What way poor bodies liv'd ava. Our laird gets in his rackèd rents, His coals, his kain, an' a' his stents: He rises when he likes himsel; His flunkies answer at the bell; He ca's his coach; he ca's his horse; He draws a bonie silken purse, As lang's my tail, whare, thro' the steeks, The yellow letter'd Geordie keeks. Frae morn to e'en it's nought but toiling, At baking, roasting, frying, boiling; An' tho' the gentry first are stechin, Yet ev'n the ha' folk fill their pechan Wi' sauce, ragouts, an sic like trashtrie, That's little short o' downright wastrie: Our whipper-in, wee, blastit wonner, Poor, worthless elf, it eats a dinner, Better than onie ienant-man His Honor has in a' the lan'; An' what poor cot-folk pit their painch in, I own it's past my comprehension. LUATH Trowth, Cæsar, whyles they're fash't eneugh: A cotter howkin in a sheugh, Wi' dirty stanes biggin a dyke, Baring a quarry, an' sic like; Himsel, a wife, he thus sustains, A smytrie o' wee duddie weans, An' nought but his han' darg to keep Them right an' tight in thack an' rape. An' when they meet wi' sair disasters, Like loss o' health or want o' masters, Ye maist wad think, a wee touch langer, An' they maun starve o' cauld and hunger: But how it comes, I never kend yet, They're maistly wonderfu' contented; An' buirdly chiels, an' clever hizzies, Are bred in sic a way as this is. CÆSAR But then to see how ye're negleckit, How huff'd, an' cuff'd, an' disrespeckit! Lord man, our gentry care as little For delvers, ditchers, an' sic cattle; They gang as saucy by poor folk, As I wad by a stinking brock. I've notic'd, on our laird's court-day, (An' monie a time my heart's been wae), Poor tenant bodies, scant o' cash, How they maun thole a factor's snash: He'll stamp an' threaten, curse an' swear He'll apprehend them, poind their gear; While they maun staun', wi' aspect humble, An' hear it a', an' fear an' tremble! I see how folk live that hae riches; But surely poor-folk maun be wretches! LUATH They're nae sae wretched's ane wad think: Tho' constantly on poortith's brink, They're sae accustom'd wi' the sight, The view o't gies them little fright. Then chance an' fortune are sae guided, They're ay in less or mair provided; An' tho' fatigu'd wi' close employment, A blink o' rest's a sweet enjoyment. The dearest comfort o' their lives, Their grushie weans an' faithfu' wives; The prattling things are just their pride, That sweetens a' their fire-side. An' whyles twalpennie worth o' nappy Can mak the bodies unco happy: They lay aside their private cares, To mind the Kirk and State affairs; They'll talk o' patronage an' priests, Wi' kindling fury i' their breasts, Or tell what new taxation's comin, An' ferlie at the folk in Lon'on. As bleak-fac'd Hallowmass returns, They get the jovial, ranting kirns, When rural life, of ev'ry station, Unite in common recreation; Love blinks, Wit slaps, an' social Mirth Forgets there's Care upo' the earth. That merry day the year begins, They bar the door on frosty win's; The nappy reeks wi' mantling ream, An' sheds a heart-inspiring steam; The luntin pipe, an' sneeshin mill, Are handed round wi right guid will; The cantie auld folks crackin crouse, The young anes ranting thro' the house— My heart has been sae fain to see them, That I for joy hae barkit wi' them. Still it's owre true that ye hae said Sic game is now owre aften play'd; There's monie a creditable stock O' decent, honest, fawsont folk, Are riven out baith root an' branch, Some rascal's pridefu' greed to quench, Wha thinks to knit himsel the faster In favor wi' some gentle master, Wha, aiblins thrang a parliamentin', For Britain's guid his saul indentin' ? CÆSAR Haith, lad, ye little ken about it: For Britain's guid! guid faith! I doubt it. Say rather, gaun as Premiers lead him: An' saying aye or no's they bid him: At operas an' plays parading, Mortgaging, gambling, masquerading: Or maybe, in a frolic daft, To Hague or Calais taks a waft, To mak a tour an' tak a whirl, To learn bon ton, an' see the worl'. There, at Vienna or Versailles, He rives his father's auld entails; Or by Madrid he taks the rout, To thrum guitars an' fecht wi' nowt; Or down Italian vista startles, Whore-hunting amang groves o' myrtles Then bowses drumlie German-water, To mak himsel look fair an' fatter, An' clear the consequential sorrows, Love-gifts of Carnival signoras. For Britain's guid! for her destruction! Wi' dissipation, feud an' faction. LUATH Hech man! dear sirs! is that the gate They waste sae monie a braw estate! Are we sae foughten an' harass'd For gear ta gang that gate at last? O would they stay aback frae courts, An' please themsels wi' countra sports, It wad for ev'ry ane be better, The laird, the tenant, an' the cotter! For thae frank, rantin, ramblin billies, Fient haet o' them's ill-hearted fellows: Except for breakin o' their timmer, Or speakin lightly o' their limmer, Or shootin of a hare or moor-cock, The ne'er-a-bit they're ill to poor folk. But will ye tell me, master Cæsar: Sure great folk's life's a life o' pleasure? Nae cauld nor hunger e'er can steer them, The vera thought o't need na fear them. CÆSAR Lord, man, were ye but whyles whare I am, The gentles, ye wad ne'er envý 'em! It's true, they need na starve or sweat, Thro' winter's cauld, or simmer's heat; They've nae sair wark to craze their banes, An' fill auld-age wi' grips an' granes: But human bodies are sic fools, For a' their colleges an' schools, That when nae real ills perplex them, They mak enow themsels to vex them; An' ay the less they hae to sturt them, In like proportion, less will hurt them. A countra fellow at the pleugh, His acre's till'd, he's right eneugh; A countra girl at her wheel, Her dizzen's done, she's unco weel; But gentlemen, an' ladies warst, Wi' ev'n down want o' wark are curst: They loiter, lounging, lank an' lazy; Tho' deil-haet ails them, yet uneasy: Their days insipid, dull an' tasteless; Their nights unquiet, lang an' restless. An' ev'n their sports, their balls an' races, Their galloping through public places, There's sic parade, sic pomp an' art, The joy can scarcely reach the heart. The men cast out in party-matches, Then sowther a' in deep debauches; Ae night they're mad wi' drink an' whoring, Niest day their life is past enduring. The ladies arm-in-arm in clusters, As great an' gracious a' as sisters; But hear their absent thoughts o' ither, They're a' run deils an' jads thegither. Whyles, owre the wee bit cup an' platie, They sip the scandal-potion pretty; Or lee-lang nights, wi' crabbit leuks Pore owre the devil's pictur'd beuks; Stake on a chance a farmer's stackyard, An' cheat like onie unhang'd blackguard. There's some exceptions, man an' woman; But this is Gentry's life in common. By this, the sun was out o' sight, An' darker gloamin brought the night; The bum-clock humm'd wi' lazy drone; The kye stood rowtin i' the loan; When up they gat, an' shook their lugs, Rejoic'd they were na men, but dogs; An' each took aff his several way, Resolv'd to meet some ither day. SCOTCH DRINK Gie him strong drink until he wink, That's sinking in despair; An' liquor guid to fire his bluid, That's prest wi' grief an' care: There let him bowse, and deep carouse, Wi' bumpers flowing o'er, Till he forgets his loves or debts, An' minds his griefs no more. SOLOMON'S PROVERBS, xxxi. 6, 7. I Let other poets raise a frácas 'Bout vines, an' wines, an' drucken Bacchus, An' crabbit names an' stories wrack us, An' grate our lug: I sing the juice Scotch bear can mak us, In glass or jug. II O thou, my Muse! guid auld Scotch drink! Whether thro' wimplin worms thou jink, Or, richly brown, ream owre the brink, In glorious faem, Inspire me, till I lisp an' wink, To sing thy name! III Let husky wheat the haughs adorn, An' aits set up their awnie horn, An' pease an' beans, at e'en or morn, Perfume the plain: Leeze me on thee, John Barleycorn, Thou king o' grain! IV On thee aft Scotland chows her cood, In souple scones, the wale o' food! Or tumbling in the boiling flood Wi' kail an' beef; But when thou pours thy strong heart's blood, There thou shines chief. V Food fills the wame, an' keeps us livin; Tho' life's a gift no worth receivin, When heavy-dragg'd wi' pine an' grievin; But oil'd by thee, The wheels o' life gae down-hill, scrievin, Wi' rattlin glee. VI Thou clears the head o' doited Lear, Thou cheers the heart o' drooping Care; Thou strings the nerves o' Labour sair, At's weary toil; Thou ev'n brightens dark Despair Wi' gloomy smile. VII Aft, clad in massy siller weed, Wi' gentles thou erects thy head; Yet, humbly kind in time o' need, The poor man's wine: His wee drap parritch, or his bread, Thou kitchens fine. VIII Thou art the life o' public haunts: But thee, what were our fairs and rants? Ev'n godly meetings o' the saunts, By thee inspir'd, When, gaping, they besiege the tents, Are doubly fir'd. IX That merry night we get the corn in, O sweetly, then, thou reams the horn in! Or reekin on a New-Year mornin In cog or bicker, An' just a wee drap sp'ritual burn in, An' gusty sucker! X When Vulcan gies his bellows breath, An' ploughmen gather wi' their graith, O rare! to see thee fizz an' freath I' th'lugget caup! Then Burnewin comes on like death At ev'ry chaup. XI Nae mercy, then, for airn or steel: The brawnie, bainie, ploughman chiel, Brings hard owrehip, wi' sturdy wheel, The strong forehammer, Till block an' studdie ring an' reel, Wi' dinsome clamour. XII When skirlin weanies see the light, Thou maks the gossips clatter bright. How fumbling cuifs their dearies slight; Wae worth the name! Nae howdie gets a social night, Or plack frae them. XIII When neebors anger at a plea, An' just as wud as wud can be, How easy can the barley-brie Cement the quarrel! It's aye the cheapest lawyer's fee, To taste the barrel. XIV Alake! that e'er my Muse has reason, To wyte her countrymen wi' treason! But monie daily weet their weason Wi' liquors nice, An' hardly, in a winter season, E'er spier her price. XV Wae worth that brandy, burnin trash! Fell source o' monie a pain an' brash! Twins monie a poor, doylt, drucken hash, O' half his days; An' sends, beside, auld Scotland's cash To her warst faes. XVI Ye Scots, wha wish auld Scotland well! Ye chief, to you my tale I tell, Poor, plackless devils like mysel! It sets you ill, Wi' bitter, dearthfu' wines to mell, Or foreign gill. XVII May gravels round his blather wrench, An' gouts torment him, inch by inch, Wha twists his gruntle wi' a glunch O' sour disdain, Out owre a glass o' whisky-punch Wi' honest men! XVIII O Whisky! soul o' plays an' pranks! Accept a Bardie's gratefu' thanks! When wanting thee, what tuneless cranks Are my poor verses! Thou comes—they rattle i' their ranks At ither's arses! XIX Thee, Ferintosh! O sadly lost! Scotland lament frae coast to coast! Now colic grips, an' barkin hoast May kill us a'; For loyal Forbés' chartered boast Is taen awa! XX Thae curst horse-leeches o' th'Excise, Wha mak the whisky stells their prize! Haud up thy han', Deil! ance, twice, thrice! There, seize the blinkers! An' bake them up in brunstane pies For poor damn'd drinkers. XXI Fortune! if thou'll but gie me still Hale breeks, a scone, an' whisky gill, An' rowth o' rhyme to rave at will, Tak a' the rest, An' deal't about as thy blind skill Directs thee best. THE AUTHOR'S EARNEST CRY AND PRAYER TO THE SCOTCH REPRESENTATIVES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS Dearest of distillation! last and best— —How art thou lost!— PARODY ON MILTON. I Ye Irish lords, ye knights an' squires, Wha represent our brughs an' shires, An' doucely manage our affairs In Parliament, To you a simple Bardie's prayers Are humbly sent. II Alas! my roupet Muse is haerse! Your Honors' hearts wi' grief 'twad pierce, To see her sittin on her arse Low i' the dust, And scriechin out prosaic verse, An' like to brust! III Tell them wha hae the chief direction, Scotland an' me's in great affliction, E'er sin' they laid that curst restriction On aqua-vitæ; An' rouse them up to strong conviction, An' move their pity. IV Stand forth, an' tell yon Premier youth The honest, open, naked truth: Tell him o' mine an' Scotland's drouth, His servants humble: The muckle deevil blaw you south, If ye dissemble! V Does onie great man glunch an' gloom? Speak out, an' never fash your thumb! Let posts an' pensions sink or soom Wi' them wha grant 'em: If honestly they canna come, Far better want 'em. VI In gath'rin votes you were na slack; Now stand as tightly by your tack: Ne'er claw your lug, an' fidge your back, An' hum an haw; But raise your arm, an' tell your crack Before them a'. VII Paint Scotland greetin owre her thrissle; Her mutchkin stowp as toom's a whissle; An' damn'd excisemen in a bustle, Seizin a stell, Triumphant, crushin't like a mussel, Or lampit shell! VIII Then, on the tither hand, present her— A blackguard smuggler right behint her, An' cheek-for-chow, a chuffie vintner Colleaguing join, Pickin her pouch as bare as winter Of a' kind coin. IX Is there, that bears the name o' Scot, But feels his heart's bluid rising hot, To see his poor auld mither's pot Thus dung in staves, An' plunder'd o' her hindmost groat, By gallows knaves? X Alas! I'm but a nameless wight, Trode i' the mire out o' sight! But could I like Montgomeries nght, Or gab like Boswell, There's some sark-necks I wad draw tight, An' tie some hose well. XI God bless your Honors! can ye see't, The kind, auld, cantie carlin greet, An' no get warmly to your feet, An' gar them hear it, An' tell them wi' a patriot-heat, Ye winna bear it? XII Some o' you nicely ken the laws, To round the period an' pause, An' with rhetòric clause on clause To mak harangues: Then echo thro' Saint Stephen's wa's Auld Scotland's wrangs. XIII Dempster, a true blue Scot I'se warran; Thee, aith-detesting, chaste Kilkerran; An' that glib-gabbet Highland baron, The Laird o' Graham; An' ane, a chap that's damn'd auldfarran, Dundas his name: XIV Erskine, a spunkie Norland billie; True Campbells, Frederick and Ilay; An' Livistone, the bauld Sir Willie; An' monie ithers, Whom auld Demosthenes or Tully Might own for brithers. XV Thee sodger Hugh, my watchman stented, If Bardies e'er are represented; I ken if that your sword were wanted, Ye'd lend your hand; But when there's ought to say anent it, Ye're at a stand. XVI Arouse, my boys! exert your mettle, To get auld Scotland back her kettle; Or faith! I'll wad my new pleugh-pettle, Ye'll see't or lang, She'll teach you, wi' a reekin whittle, Anither sang. XVII This while she's been in crankous mood, Her lost Militia fir'd her bluid; (Deil na they never mair do guid, Play'd her that pliskie!) An' now she's like to rin red-wud About her whisky. XVIII An' Lord! if ance they pit her till't, Her tartan petticoat she'll kilt, An' durk an' pistol at her belt, She'll tak the streets, An' rin her whittle to the hilt, I' the first she meets! XIX For God-sake, sirs! then speak her fair, An' straik her cannie wi' the hair, An' to the Muckle House repair, Wi' instant speed, An' strive, wi' a' your wit an' lear, To get remead. XX Yon ill-tongu'd tinkler, Charlie Fox, May taunt you wi' his jeers an' mocks; But gie him't het, my hearty cocks! E'en cowe the cadie! An' send him to his dicing box An' sportin lady. XXI Tell yon guid bluid of auld Boconnock's, I'll be his debt twa mashlum bonnocks, An' drink his health in auld Nanse Tinnock's Nine times a-week, If he some scheme, like tea an' winnocks, Wad kindly seek. XXII Could he some commutation broach, I'll pledge my aith in guid braid Scotch, He needna fear their foul reproach Nor erudition, Yon mixtie-maxtie, queer hotch-potch, The Coalition. XXIII Auld Scotland has a raucle tongue; She's just a devil wi' a rung; An' if she promise auld or young To tak their part, Tho' by the neck she should be strung, She'll no desert. XXIV And now, ye chosen Five-and-Forty, May still your mither's heart support ye; Then, tho' a minister grow dorty, An' kick your place, Ye'll snap your fingers, poor an' hearty, Before his face. XXV God bless your Honors, a' your days, Wi' sowps o' kail and brats o' claes, In spite o' a' the thievish kaes, That haunt St. Jamie's! Your humble Bardie sings an' prays, While Rab his name is. POSTSCRIPT XXVI Let half-starv'd slaves in warmer skies See future wines, rich-clust'ring, rise; Their lot auld Scotland ne'er envies, But, blythe and frisky, She eyes her freeborn, martial boys Tak aff their whisky. XXVII What tho' their Phœbus kinder warms, While fragrance blooms and Beauty charms, When wretches range, in famish'd swarms, The scented groves; Or, hounded forth, dishonor arms In hungry droves! XXVIII Their gun's a burden on their shouther; They downa bide the stink o' powther; Their bauldest thought's a hank'ring swither To stan' or rin, Till skelp—a shot—they're aff, a' throw'ther, To save their skin. XXIX But bring a Scotsman frae his hill, Clap in his cheek a Highland gill, Say, such is royal George's will, An' there's the foe! He has nae thought but how to kill Twa at a blow. XXX Nae cauld, faint-hearted doubtings tease him; Death comes, wi' fearless eye he sees him; Wi' bluidy han' a welcome gies him; An' when he fa's, His latest draught o' breathin lea'es him In faint huzzas. XXXI Sages their solemn een may steek An' raise a philosophic reek, An' physically causes seek In clime an' season; But tell me whisky's name in Greek: I'll tell the reason. XXXII Scotland, my auld, respected mither! Tho' whiles ye moistify your leather, Till whare ye sit on craps o' heather Ye tine your dam, Freedom and whisky gang thegither, Tak aff your dram! THE HOLY FAIR A robe of seeming truth and trust Hid crafty observation; And secret hung, with poison'd crust, The dirk of defamation: A mask that like the gorget show'd, Dye-varying on the pigeon; And for a mantle large and broad, He wrapt him in Religion. HYPOCRISY A-LA-MODE. I Upon a simmer Sunday morn, When Nature's face is fair, I walkèd forth to view the corn, An' snuff the caller air. The rising sun, owre Galston Muirs, Wi' glorious light was glintin; The hares were hirplin down the furs, The lav'rocks they were chantin Fu' sweet that day. II As lightsomely I glowr'd abroad, To see a scene sae gay, Three hizzies, early at the road, Cam skelpin up the way. Twa had manteeles o' dolefu' black, But ane wi' lyart lining; The third, that gaed a wee a-back, Was in the fashion shining Fu' gay that day. III The twa appear'd like sisters twin, In feature, form, an' claes; Their visage wither'd, lang an' thin, An' sour as onie slaes: The third cam up, hap-step-an'-lowp, As light as onie lambie, An' wi' a curchie low did stoop, As soon as e'er she saw me, Fu' kind that day. IV Wi' bonnet aff, quoth I, ‘Sweet lass, I think ye seem to ken me; I'm sure I've seen that bonie face, But yet I canna name ye.’ Quo' she, an' laughin as she spak, An' taks me by the han's, ‘Ye, for my sake, hae gi'en the feck Of a' the Ten Comman's A screed some day. V ‘My name is Fun—your cronie dear, The nearest friend ye hae; An' this is Superstition here, An' that's Hypocrisy. I'm gaun to Mauchline Holy Fair, To spend an hour in daffin: Gin ye'll go there, yon runkl'd pair, We will get famous laughin At them this day.’ VI Quoth I, ‘Wi' a' my heart, I'll do't; I'll get my Sunday's sark on, An' meet you on the holy spot; Faith, we'se hae fine remarkin!’ Then I gaed hame at crowdie-time, An' soon I made me ready; For roads were clad, frae side to side, Wi' monie a wearie body, In droves that day. VII Here farmers gash, in ridin graith, Gaed hoddin by their cotters; There swankies young, in braw braid-claith, Are springin owre the gutters. The lasses, skelpin barefit, thrang, In silks an' scarlets glitter; Wi' sweet-milk cheese, in monie a whang, An' farls, bak'd wi' butter, Fu' crump that day. VIII When by the plate we set our nose, Weel heapèd up wi' ha'pence, A greedy glowr black-bonnet throws, An' we maun draw our tippence. Then in we go to see the show: On ev'ry side they're gath'rin; Some carryin dails, some chairs an' stools, An' some are busy bleth'rin Right loud that day. IX Here stands a shed to fend the show'rs, An' screen our countra gentry; There Racer Jess, an' twa-three whores, Are blinkin at the entry. Here sits a raw o' tittlin jads, Wi' heavin breasts an' bare neck; An' there a batch o' wabster lads, Blackguardin frae Kilmarnock, For fun this day. X Here some are thinkin on their sins, An' some upo' their claes; Ane curses feet that fyl'd his shins, Anither sighs an' prays: On this hand sits a chosen swatch, Wi' screw'd-up, grace-proud faces; On that a set o' chaps, at watch, Thrang winkin on the lasses To chairs that day. XI O happy is that man an' blest! Nae wonder that it pride him! Whase ain dear lass, that he likes best, Comes clinkin down beside him! Wi' arm repos'd on the chair back, He sweetly does compose him; Which, by degrees, slips round her neck, An's loof upon her bosom, Unkend that day. XII Now a' the congregation o'er Is silent expectation; For Moodie speels the holy door, Wi' tidings o' damnation: Should Hornie, as in ancient days, 'Mang sons o' God present him; The vera sight o' Moodie's face, To's ain het hame had sent him Wi' fright that day. XIII Hear how he clears the points o' Faith Wi' rattlin and thumpin! Now meekly calm, now wild in wrath, He's stampin, an' he's jumpin! His lengthen'd chin, his turn'd-up snout, His eldritch squeel an' gestures, O how they fire the heart devout— Like cantharidian plaisters On sic a day. XIV But hark! the tent has chang'd its voice; There's peace an' rest nae langer; For a' the real judges rise, They canna sit for anger: Smith opens out his cauld harangues, On practice and on morals; An' aff the godly pour in thrangs, To gie the jars an' barrels A lift that day. XV What signifies his barren shine, Of moral pow'rs an' reason? His English style, an' gesture fine Are a' clean out o' season. Like Socrates or Antonine, Or some auld pagan heathen, The moral man he does define, But ne'er a word o' faith in That's right that day. XVI In guid time comes an antidote Against sic poison'd nostrum; For Peebles, frae the water-fit, Ascends the holy rostrum: See, up he's got the word o' God, An' meek an' mim has view'd it, While Common-sense has taen the road, An' aff, an' up the Cowgate Fast, fast that day. XVII Wee Miller niest, the guard relieves, An' orthodoxy raibles, Tho' in his heart he weel believes, An' thinks it auld wives' fables: But faith! the birkie wants a manse: So, cannilie he hums them; Altho' his carnal wit an' sense Like hafflins-wise o'ercomes him At times that day. XVIII Now butt an' ben the change-house fills, Wi' yill-caup commentators; Here's crying out for bakes an' gills, An' there the pint-stowp clatters; While thick an' thrang, an' loud an' lang, Wi' logic an' wi' Scripture, They raise a din, that in the end Is like to breed a rupture O' wrath that day. XIX Leeze me on drink! it gies us mair Than either school or college; It kindles wit, it waukens lear, It pangs us fou o' knowledge: Be't whisky-gill or penny wheep, Or onie stronger potion, It never fails, on drinkin deep, To kittle up our notion, By night or day. XX The lads an' lasses, blythely bent To mind baith saul an' body, Sit round the table, weel content, An' steer about the toddy: On this ane's dress, an' that ane's leuk, They're makin observations; While some are cozie i' the neuk, An' formin assignations To meet some day. XXI But now the Lord's ain trumpet touts, Till a' the hills are rairin, And echoes back return the shouts; Black Russell is na spairin: His piercin words, like Highlan' swords, Divide the joints an' marrow; His talk o' Hell, whare devils dwell, Our verra ‘sauls does harrow’ Wi' fright that day! XXII A vast, unbottom'd, boundless pit, Fill'd fou o' lowin brunstane, Whase ragin flame, an' scorchin heat, Wad melt the hardest whun-stane! The half-asleep start up wi' fear, An' think they hear it roarin; When presently it does appear, 'Twas but some neebor snorin Asleep that day. XXIII 'Twad be owre lang a tale to tell, How monie stories past; An' how they crouded to the yill, When they were a' dismist; How drink gaed round, in cogs an' caups, Amang the furms an' benches; An' cheese an' bread, frae women's laps, Was dealt about in lunches, An' dawds that day. XXIV In comes a gawsie, gash guidwife, An' sits down by the fire, Syne draws her kebbuck an' her knife; The lasses they are shyer: The auld guidmen, about the grace, Frae side to side they bother; Till some ane by his bonnet lays, An' gies them't, like a tether, Fu' lang that day. XXV Waesucks! for him that gets nae lass, Or lasses that hae naething! Sma' need has he to say a grace, Or melvie his braw claithing! O wives, be mindfu', ance yoursel, How bonie lads ye wanted; An' dinna for a kebbuck-heel Let lasses be affronted On sic a day! XXVI Now Clinkumbell, wi' rattlin tow, Begins to jow an' croon; Some swagger hame the best they dow, Some wait the afternoon. At slaps the billies halt a blink, Till lasses strip their shoon: Wi' faith an' hope, an' love an' drink, They're a' in famous tune For crack that day. XXVII How monie hearts this day converts O' sinners and o' lasses! Their hearts o' stane, gin night, are gane As saft as onie flesh is: There's some are fou o' love divine; There's some are fou o' brandy; An' monie jobs that day begin, May end in houghmagandie Some ither day. ADDRESS TO THE DEIL O Prince! O Chief of many thronèd pow'rs! That led th'embattl'd seraphim to war. MILTON. I O Thou! whatever title suit thee— Auld Hornie, Satan, Nick, or Clootie— Wha in yon cavern grim an' sootie, Clos'd under hatches, Spairges about the brunstane cootie, To scaud poor wretches! II Hear me, Auld Hangie, for a wee, An' let poor damnèd bodies be; I'm sure sma' pleasure it can gie, Ev'n to a deil, To skelp an' scaud poor dogs like me An' hear us squeel. III Great is thy pow'r an' great thy fame; Far kend an' noted is thy name; An' tho' yon lowin heugh's thy hame, Thou travels far; An' faith! thou's neither lag, nor lame, Nor blate, nor scaur. IV Whyles, ranging like a roarin lion, For prey, a' holes an' corners trying; Whyles, on the strong-wing'd tempest flyin, Tirlin the kirks; Whyles, in the human bosom pryin, Unseen thou lurks. V I've heard my rev'rend graunie say, In lanely glens ye like to stray; Or, where auld ruin'd castles grey Nod to the moon, Ye fright the nightly wand'rer's way Wi' eldritch croon. VI When twilight did my graunie summon, To say her pray'rs, douce, honest woman! Aft yont the dyke she's heard you bummin, Wi' eerie drone; Or, rustlin, thro' the boortrees comin, Wi' heavy groan. VII Ae dreary, windy, winter night, The stars shot down wi' sklentin light, Wi' you mysel, I gat a fright: Ayont the lough, Ye, like a rash-buss, stood in sight, Wi' waving sugh. VIII The cudgel in my nieve did shake, Each bristl'd hair stood like a stake; When wi' an eldritch, stoor ‘quaick, quaick,’ Amang the springs, Awa ye squatter'd like a drake, On whistling wings. IX Let warlocks grim, an' wither'd hags, Tell how wi' you, on ragweed nags, They skim the muirs an' dizzy crags, Wi' wicked speed; And in kirk-yards renew their leagues, Owre howkit dead. X Thence, countra wives, wi' toil an' pain, May plunge an' plunge the kirn in vain; For O! the yellow treasure's taen By witching skill; An' dawtit, twal-pint hawkie's gaen As yell's the bill. XI Thence, mystic knots mak great abuse On young guidmen, fond, keen an' croose; When the best wark-lume i' the house, By cantraip wit, Is instant made no worth a louse, Just at the bit. XII When thowes dissolve the snawy hoord, An' float the jinglin icy boord, Then, water-kelpies haunt the foord, By your direction, An' nighted trav'llers are allur'd To their destruction. XIII And aft your moss-traversing spunkies Decoy the wight that late an' drunk is: The bleezin, curst, mischievous monkies Delude his eyes, Till in some miry slough he sunk is, Ne'er mair to rise. XIV When Masons' mystic word an' grip In storms an' tempests raise you up, Some cock or cat your rage maun stop, Or, strange to tell! The youngest brother ye wad whip Aff straught to hell. XV Lang syne in Eden's bonie yard, When youthfu' lovers first were pair'd, An' all the soul of love they shar'd, The raptur'd hour, Sweet on the fragrant flow'ry swaird, In shady bow'r: XVI Then you, ye auld, snick-drawing dog! Ye cam to Paradise incog, An' play'd on man a cursed brogue (Black be your fa'!), An' gied the infant warld a shog, 'Maist ruin'd a'. XVII D'ye mind that day when in a bizz Wi' reekit duds, an' reestit gizz, Ye did present your smoutie phiz 'Mang better folk; An' sklented on the man of Uzz Your spitefu' joke? XVIII An' how ye gat him i' your thrall, An' brak him out o' house an' hal', While scabs an' botches did him gall, Wi' bitter claw; An' lows'd his ill-tongu'd wicked scaul— Was warst ava? XIX But a' your doings to rehearse, Your wily snares an' fechtin fierce, Sin' that day Michael did you pierce Down to this time, Wad ding a Lallan tongue, or Erse, In prose or rhyme. XX An' now, Auld Cloots, I ken ye're thinkin, A certain Bardie's rantin, drinkin, Some luckless hour will send him linkin, To your black Pit; But, faith! he'll turn a corner jinkin, An' cheat you yet. XXI But fare-you-weel, Auld Nickie-Ben! O, wad ye tak a thought an' men'! Ye aiblins might—I dinna ken— Still hae a stake: I'm wae to think upo' yon den, Ev'n for your sake! THE DEATH AND DYING WORDS OF POOR MAILIE, THE AUTHOR'S ONLY PET YOWE: AN UNCO MOURNFU' TALE As Mailie, an' her lambs thegither, Was ae day nibblin on the tether, Upon her cloot she coost a hitch, An' owre she warsl'd in the ditch: There, groanin, dying, she did lie, When Hughoc he cam doytin by. Wi' glowrin een, an' lifted han's Poor Hughoc like a statue stan's; He saw her days were near-hand ended, But, wae's my heart! he could na mend it! He gapèd wide, but naething spak. At length poor Mailie silence brak:— ‘O thou, whase lamentable face Appears to mourn my woefu' case! My dying words attentive hear, An' bear them to my Master dear. ‘Tell him, if e'er again he keep As muckle gear as buy a sheep— O, bid him never tie them mair, Wi' wicked strings o' hemp or hair! But ca' them out to park or hill, An' let them wander at their will: So may his flock increase, an' grow To scores o' lambs, an' packs o' woo'! ‘Tell him, he was a Master kin', An' ay was guid to me an' mine; An' now my dying charge I gie him, My helpless lambs, I trust them wi' him. ‘O, bid him save their harmless lives, Frae dogs, an' tods, an' butchers' knives! But gie them guid cow-milk their fill, Till they be fit to fend themsel; An' tent them duly, e'en an' morn, Wi' teats o' hay an' ripps o' corn. ‘An' may they never learn the gaets, Of ither vile, wanrestfu' pets— To slink thro' slaps, an' reave an' steal, At stacks o' pease, or stocks o' kail! So may they, like their great forbears, For monie a year come thro' the sheers: So wives will gie them bits o' bread, An' bairns greet for them when they're dead. ‘My poor toop-lamb, my son an' heir, O, bid him breed him up wi' care! An' if he live to be a beast, To pit some havins in his breast! An' warn him—what I winna name— To stay content wi' yowes at hame; An' no to rin an' wear his cloots, Like other menseless, graceless brutes. ‘An' niest, my yowie, silly thing; Gude keep thee frae a tether string! O, may thou ne'er forgather up, Wi' onie blastit, moorland toop; But ay keep mind to moop an' mell, Wi' sheep o' credit like thysel! ‘And now, my bairns, wi' my last breath, I lea'e my blessin wi' you baith: An' when you think upo' your mither, Mind to be kind to ane anither. ‘Now, honest Hughoc, dinna fail, To tell my master a' my tale; An' bid him burn this cursed tether, An' for thy pains thou'se get my blether.’ This said, poor Mailie turn'd her head, An' clos'd her een amang the dead! POOR MAILIE'S ELEGY I Lament in rhyme, lament in prose, Wi' saut tears tricklin down your nose; Our Bardie's fate is at a close, Past a' remead! The last, sad cape-stane of his woes; Poor Mailie's dead! II It's no the loss of warl's gear, That could sae bitter draw the tear, Or mak our Bardie, dowie, wear The mourning weed: He's lost a friend an' neebor dear In Mailie dead. III Thro' a' the toun she trotted by him; A lang half-mile she could descry him; Wi' kindly bleat, when she did spy him, She ran wi' speed: A friend mair faithfu' ne'er cam nigh him, Than Mailie dead. IV I wat she was a sheep o' sense, An' could behave hersel wi' mense: I'll say't, she never brak a fence, Thro' thievish greed. Our Bardie, lanely, keeps the spence Sin' Mailie's dead. V Or, if he wanders up the howe, Her livin image in her yowe Comes bleatin till him, owre the knowe, For bits o' bread; An' down the briny pearls rowe For Mailie dead. VI She was nae get o' moorlan tips, Wi' tawted ket, an' hairy hips; For her forbears were brought in ships, Frae 'yont the Tweed: A bonier fleesh ne'er cross'd the clips Than Mailie's dead. VII Wae worth the man wha first did shape That vile, wanchancie thing—a rape! It maks guid fellows girn an' gape, Wi' chokin dread; An' Robin's bonnet wave wi' crape For Mailie dead. VIII O a' ye bards on bonie Doon! An' wha on Ayr your chanters tune! Come, join the melancholious croon O' Robin's reed! His heart will never get aboon! His Mailie's dead! EPISTLE TO JAMES SMITH Friendship, mysterious cement of the soul! Sweet'ner of Life, and solder of Society! I owe thee much ? BLAIR. I Dear Smith, the slee'st, pawkie thief, That e'er attempted stealth or rief! Ye surely hae some warlock-breef Owre human hearts; For ne'er a bosom yet was prief Against your arts. II For me, I swear by sun an' moon, And ev'ry star that blinks aboon, Ye've cost me twenty pair o' shoon, Just gaun to see you; And ev'ry ither pair that's done, Mair taen I'm wi' you. III That auld, capricious carlin, Nature, To mak amends for scrimpit stature, She's turn'd you off, a human-creature On her first plan; And in her freaks, on ev'ry feature She's wrote the Man. IV Just now I've taen the fit o' rhyme, My barmie noddle's working prime, My fancy yerkit up sublime, Wi' hasty summon: Hae ye a leisure-moment's time To hear what's comin? V Some rhyme a neebor's name to lash; Some rhyme (vain thought!) for needfu' cash; Some rhyme to court the countra clash, An' raise a din; For me, an aim I never fash; I rhyme for fun. VI The star that rules my luckless lot, Has fated me the russet coat, An' damn'd my fortune to the groat; But, in requit, Has blest me with a random-shot O' countra wit. VII This while my notion's taen a sklent, To try my fate in guid, black prent; But still the mair I'm that way bent, Something cries, ‘Hoolie! I red you, honest man, tak tent! Ye'll shaw your folly: VIII ‘There's ither poets, much your betters, Far seen in Greek, deep men o' letters, Hae thought they had ensur'd their debtors, A' future ages; Now moths deform, in shapeless tatters, Their unknown pages.’ IX Then farewell hopes o' laurel-boughs To garland my poetic brows! Henceforth I'll rove where busy ploughs Are whistling thrang; An' teach the lanely heights an' howes My rustic sang. X I'll wander on, wi' tentless heed How never-halting moments speed, Till Fate shall snap the brittle thread; Then, all unknown, I'll lay me with th'inglorious dead, Forgot and gone! XI But why o' death begin a tale? Just now we're living sound an' hale; Then top and maintop crowd the sail, Heave Care o'er-side! And large, before Enjoyment's gale, Let's tak the tide. XII This life, sae far's I understand, Is a' enchanted fairy-land, Where Pleasure is the magic-wand, That, wielded right, Maks hours like minutes, hand in hand, Dance by fu' light. XIII The magic-wand then let us wield; For, ance that five-an'-forty's speel'd, See, crazy, weary, joyless Eild, Wi' wrinkl'd face, Comes hostin, hirplin owre the field, Wi' creepin pace. XIV When ance life's day draws near the gloamin, Then fareweel vacant, careless roamin; An' fareweel chearfu' tankards foamin, An' social noise: An' fareweel dear, deluding Woman, The joy of joys! XV O Life! how pleasant, in thy morning, Young Fancy's rays the hills adorning! Cold-pausing Caution's lesson scorning, We frisk away, Like school-boys, at th'expected warning, To joy an' play. XVI We wander there, we wander here, We eye the rose upon the brier, Unmindful that the thorn is near, Among the leaves; And tho' the puny wound appear, Short while it grieves. XVII Some, lucky, find a flow'ry spot, For which they never toil'd nor swat; They drink the sweet and eat the fat, But care or pain; And haply eye the barren hut With high disdain. XVIII With steady aim, some Fortune chase; Keen Hope does ev'ry sinew brace; Thro' fair, thro' foul, they urge the race, And seize the prey: Then cannie, in some cozie place, They close the day. XIX And others, like your humble servan', Poor wights! nae rules nor roads observin, To right or left eternal swervin, They zig-zag on; Till, curst with age, obscure an' starvin, They aften groan. XX Alas! what bitter toil an' straining— But truce with peevish, poor complaining! Is Fortune's fickle Luna waning? E'en let her gang! Beneath what light she has remaining, Let's sing our sang. XXI My pen I here fling to the door, And kneel, ye Pow'rs! and warm implore, ‘Tho' I should wander Terra o'er, In all her climes, Grant me but this, I ask no more, Ay rowth o' rhymes. XXII ‘Gie dreeping roasts to countra lairds, Till icicles hing frae their beards; Gie fine braw claes to fine life-guards And maids of honor; And yill an' whisky gie to cairds, Until they sconner. XXIII ‘A title, Dempster merits it; A garter gie to Willie Pitt; Gie wealth to some be-ledger'd cit, In cent. per cent.; But give me real, sterling wit, And I'm content XXIV ‘While ye are pleas'd to keep me hale, I'll sit down o'er my scanty meal, Be't water-brose or muslin-kail, Wi' cheerfu' face, As lang's the Muses dinna fail To say the grace.’ XXV An anxious e'e I never throws Behint my lug, or by my nose; I jouk beneath Misfortune's blows As weel's I may; Sworn foe to sorrow, care, and prose, I rhyme away. XXVI O ye douce folk that live by rule, Grave, tideless-blooded, calm an' cool, Compar'd wi' you—O fool! fool! fool! How much unlike! Your hearts are just a standing pool, Your lives a dyke! XXVII Nae hair-brained, sentimental traces In your unletter'd, nameless faces! In arioso trills and graces Ye never stray; But gravissímo, solemn basses Ye hum away. XXVIII Ye are sae grave, nae doubt ye're wise; Nae ferly tho' ye do despise The hairum-scairum, ram-stam boys, The rattling squad: I see ye upward cast your eyes— Ye ken the road! XXIX Whilst I—but I shall haud me there, Wi' you I'll scarce gang onie where— Then, Jamie, I shall say nae mair, But quat my sang, Content wi' you to mak a pair, Whare'er I gang. A DREAM Thoughts, words, and deeds, the Statute blames with reason; But surely Dreams were ne'er indicted Treason. On reading in the public papers, the Laureate's Ode with the other parade of June 4th, 1786, the Author was no sooner dropt asleep, than he imagined himself transported to the Birth-day Levee: and, in his dreaming fancy, made the following Address:— I Guid-mornin to your Majesty! May Heaven augment your blisses, On ev'ry new birth-day ye see, A humble Poet wishes! My Bardship here, at your Levee, On sic a day as this is, Is sure an uncouth sight to see, Amang thae birth-day dresses Sae fine this day. II I see ye're complimented thrang, By monie a lord an' lady; God Save the King's a cuckoo sang That's unco easy said ay: The poets, too, a venal gang, Wi' rhymes weel-turn'd an' ready, Wad gar you trow ye ne'er do wrang, But ay unerring steady, On sic a day. III For me! before a Monarch's face, Ev'n there I winna flatter; For neither pension, post, nor place, Am I your humble debtor: So, nae reflection on your Grace, Your Kingship to bespatter; There's monie waur been o' the race, And aiblins ane been better Than you this day. IV 'Tis very true my sovereign King, My skill may weel be doubted; But facts are chiels that winna ding, And downa be disputed: Your royal nest, beneath your wing, Is e'en right reft and clouted, And now the third part o' the string, An' less, will gang about it Than did ae day. V Far be't frae me that I aspire To blame your legislation, Or say, ye wisdom want, or fire To rule this mighty nation: But faith! I muckle doubt, my sire, Ye've trusted ministration To chaps wha in a barn or byre Wad better fill'd their station, Than courts yon day. VI And now ye've gien auld Britain peace, Her broken shins to plaister; Your sair taxation does her fleece, Till she has scarce a tester: For me, thank God, my life's a lease, Nae bargain wearin faster, Or faith! I fear, that, wi' the geese, I shortly boost to pasture I' the craft some day. VII I'm no mistrusting Willie Pitt, When taxes he enlarges, (An' Will's a true guid fallow's get, A name not envy spairges), That he intends to pay your debt, An' lessen a' your charges; But, God sake! let nae saving fit Abridge your bonie barges An' boats this day. VIII Adieu, my Liege! may Freedom geck Beneath your high protection; An' may ye rax Corruption's neck, And gie her for dissection! But since I'm here I'll no neglect, In loyal, true affection, To pay your Queen, wi' due respect, My fealty an' subjection This great birth-day. IX Hail, Majesty most Excellent! While nobles strive to please ye, Will ye accept a compliment, A simple Bardie gies ye? Thae bonie bairntime Heav'n has lent, Still higher may they heeze ye In bliss, till Fate some day is sent, For ever to release ye Frae care that day. X For you, young Potentate o' Wales, I tell your Highness fairly, Down Pleasure's stream, wi' swelling sails, I'm tauld ye're driving rarely; But some day ye may gnaw your nails, An' curse your folly sairly, That e'er ye brak Diana's pales, Or rattl'd dice wi' Charlie By night or day. XI Yet aft a ragged cowte's been known, To mak a noble aiver; So, ye may doucely fill a throne, For a' their clish-ma-claver: There, him at Agincourt wha shone, Few better were or braver; And yet, wi' funny, queer Sir John, He was an unco shaver For monie a day. XII For you, right rev'rend Osnaburg, Nane sets the lawn-sleeve sweeter, Altho' a ribban at your lug Wad been a dress completer: As ye disown yon paughty dog, That bears the keys of Peter, Then swith! an' get a wife to hug, Or trowth, ye'll stain the mitre Some luckless day! XIII Young, royal Tarry-breeks, I learn, Ye've lately come athwart her— A glorious galley, stem an' stern Weel rigg'd for Venus' barter; But first hang out that she'll discern Your hymeneal charter; Then heave aboard your grapple-airn, An', large upon her quarter, Come full that day. XIV Ye, lastly, bonie blossoms a', Ye royal lasses dainty, Heav'n mak you guid as weel as braw, An' gie you lads a-plenty! But sneer na British boys awa! For kings are unco scant ay, An' German gentles are but sma': They're better just than want ay On onie day. XV God bless you a'! consider now, Ye're unco muckle dautet; But ere the course o' life be through, It may be bitter sautet: An' I hae seen their coggie fou, That yet hae tarrow't at it; But or the day was done, I trow, The laggen they hae clautet Fu' clean that day. THE VISION DUAN FIRST I The sun had clos'd the winter day, The curlers quat their roaring play, And hunger'd maukin taen her way, To kail-yards green, While faithless snaws ilk step betray Whare she has been. II The thresher's weary flingin-tree, The lee-lang day had tired me; And when the day had clos'd his e'e Far i' the west, Ben i' the spence, right pensivelie, I gaed to rest. III There, lanely by the ingle-cheek, I sat and ey'd the spewing reek, That fill'd, wi' hoast-provoking smeek, The auld clay biggin; An' heard the restless rattons squeak About the riggin. IV All in this mottie, misty clime, I backward mus'd on wasted time: How I had spent my youthfu' prime, An' done naething, But stringing blethers up in rhyme, For fools to sing. V Had I to guid advice but harkit, I might, by this, hae led a market, Or strutted in a bank and clarkit My cash-account: While here, half-mad, half-fed, half-sarkit, Is a' th'amount. VI I started, mutt'ring ‘Blockhead! coof!’ An' heav'd on high my waukit loof, To swear by a' yon starry roof, Or some rash aith, That I henceforth would be rhyme-proof Till my last breath— VII When click! the string the snick did draw; And jee! the door gaed to the wa'; And by my ingle-lowe I saw, Now bleezin bright, A tight, outlandish hizzie, braw, Come full in sight. VIII Ye need na doubt, I held my whisht; The infant aith, half-form'd, was crusht; I glowr'd as eerie's I'd been dusht, In some wild glen; When sweet, like modest Worth, she blusht, And stepped ben. IX Green, slender, leaf-clad holly-boughs Were twisted, gracefu', round her brows; I took her for some Scottish Muse, By that same token; And come to stop those reckless vows, Would soon been broken. X A ‘hair-brain'd, sentimental trace’ Was strongly markèd in her face; A wildly-witty, rustic grace Shone full upon her; Her eye, ev'n turn'd on empty space, Beam'd keen with honor. XI Down flow'd her robe, a tartan sheen, Till half a leg was scrimply seen; And such a leg! my bonie Jean Could only peer it; Sae straught, sae taper, tight an' clean Nane else came near it. XII Her mantle large, of greenish hue, My gazing wonder chiefly drew; Deep lights and shades, bold-mingling, threw A lustre grand; And seem'd, to my astonish'd view, A well-known land. XIII Here, rivers in the sea were lost; There, mountains to the skies were toss't; Here, tumbling billows mark'd the coast With surging foam; There, distant shone Art's lofty boast, The lordly dome. XIV Here, Doon pour'd down his far-fetch'd floods; There, well-fed Irwine stately thuds: Auld hermit Ayr staw thro' his woods, On to the shore; And many a lesser torrent scuds With seeming roar. XV Low, in a sandy valley spread, An ancient borough rear'd her head; Still, as in Scottish story read, She boasts a race To ev'ry nobler virtue bred, And polish'd grace. XVI By stately tow'r, or palace fair, Or ruins pendent in the air, Bold stems of heroes, here and there, I could discern; Some seem'd to muse, some seem'd to dare, With feature stern. XVII My heart did glowing transport feel, To see a race heroic wheel, And brandish round the deep-dyed steel In sturdy blows; While, back-recoiling, seem'd to reel Their suthron foes. XVIII His Country's Saviour, mark him well! Bold Richardton's heroic swell; The chief, on Sark who glorious fell In high command; And he whom ruthless fates expel His native land. XIX There, where a sceptr'd Pictish shade Stalk'd round his ashes lowly laid, I mark'd a martial race, pourtray'd In colours strong: Bold, soldier-featur'd, undismay'd, They strode along. XX Thro' many a wild, romantic grove, Near many a hermit-fancied cove (Fit haunts for friendship or for love In musing mood), An aged Judge, I saw him rove, Dispensing good. XXI With deep-struck, reverential awe, The learned Sire and Son I saw: To Nature's God, and Nature's law, They gave their lore; This, all its source and end to draw, That, to adore. XXII Brydon's brave ward I well could spy, Beneath old Scotia's smiling eye; Who call'd on Fame, low standing by, To hand him on, Where many a patriot-name on high, And hero shone. DUAN SECOND I With musing-deep, astonish'd stare, I view'd the heavenly-seeming Fair; A whisp'ring throb did witness bear Of kindred sweet, When with an elder sister's air She did me greet. II All hail! my own inspirèd Bard! In me thy native Muse regard! Nor longer mourn thy fate is hard, Thus poorly low! I come to give thee such reward, As we bestow. III ‘Know, the great Genius of this land Has many a light aerial band, Who, all beneath his high command, Harmoniously, As arts or arms they understand, Their labors ply. IV ‘They Scotia's race among them share: Some fire the soldier on to dare; Some rouse the patriot up to bare Corruption's heart; Some teach the bard—a darling care— The tuneful art. V ‘'Mong swelling floods of reeking gore, They, ardent, kindling spirits pour; Or, 'mid the venal Senate's roar, They, sightless, stand, To mend the honest patriot-lore, And grace the hand. VI ‘And when the bard, or hoary sage, Charm or instruct the future age, They bind the wild poetic rage In energy; Or point the inconclusive page Full on the eye. VII ‘Hence, Fullarton, the brave and young; Hence, Dempster's zeal-inspirèd tongue; Hence, sweet, harmonious Beattie sung His Minstrel lays, Or tore, with noble ardour stung, The sceptic's bays. VIII ‘To lower orders are assign'd The humbler ranks of human-kind, The rustic bard, the laboring hind, The artisan; All chuse, as various they're inclin'd, The various man. IX ‘When yellow waves the heavy grain, The threat'ning storm some strongly rein, Some teach to meliorate the plain, With tillage-skill; And some instruct the shepherd-train, Blythe o'er the hill. X ‘Some hint the lover's harmless wile; Some grace the maiden's artless smile; Some soothe the laborer's weary toil For humble gains, And make his cottage-scenes beguile His cares and pains. XI ‘Some, bounded to a district-space, Explore at large man's infant race, To mark the embryotic trace Of rustic bard; And careful note each opening grace, A guide and guard. XII ‘Of these am I—Coila my name: And this distrìct as mine I claim, Where once the Campbells, chiefs of fame, Held ruling pow'r: I mark'd thy embryo-tuneful flame, Thy natal hour. XIII ‘With future hope I oft would gaze, Fond, on thy little early ways: Thy rudely caroll'd, chiming phrase, In uncouth rhymes; Fir'd at the simple, artless lays Of other times. XIV I saw thee seek the sounding shore, Delighted with the dashing roar; Or when the North his fleecy store Drove thro' the sky, I saw grim Nature's visage hoar Struck thy young eye. XV ‘Or when the deep green-mantled earth Warm cherish'd ev'ry flow'ret's birth, And joy and music pouring forth In ev'ry grove; I saw thee eye the gen'ral mirth With boundless love. XVI ‘When ripen'd fields and azure skies Call'd forth the reapers' rustling noise, I saw thee leave their ev'ning joys, And lonely stalk, To vent thy bosom's swelling rise, In pensive walk. XVII ‘When youthful Love, warm-blushing, strong, Keen-shivering, shot thy nerves along, Those accents grateful to thy tongue, Th' adorèd Name, I taught thee how to pour in song To soothe thy flame. XVIII ‘I saw thy pulse's maddening play, Wild-send thee Pleasure's devious way, Misled by Fancy's meteor-ray, By passion driven; But yet the light that led astray Was light from Heaven. XIX ‘I taught thy manners-painting strains The loves, the ways of simple swains, Till now, o'er all my wide domains Thy fame extends; And some, the pride of Coila's plains, Become thy friends. XX ‘Thou canst not learn, nor can I show, To paint with Thomson's landscape glow; Or wake the bosom-melting throe With Shenstone's art; Or pour, with Gray, the moving flow Warm on the heart. XXI ‘Yet, all beneath th'unrivall'd rose, The lowly daisy sweetly blows; Tho' large the forest's monarch throws His army-shade, Yet green the juicy hawthorn grows Adown the glade. XXII ‘Then never murmur nor repine; Strive in thy humble sphere to shine; And trust me, not Potosi's mine, Nor king's regard, Can give a bliss o'ermatching thine, A rustic Bard. XXIII ‘To give my counsels all in one: Thy tuneful flame still careful fan; Preserve the dignity of Man, With soul erect; And trust the Universal Plan Will all protect. XXIV ‘And wear thou this’—She solemn said, And bound the holly round my head: The polish'd leaves and berries red Did rustling play; And, like a passing thought, she fled In light away. HALLOWEEN Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain, The simple pleasures of the lowly train: To me more dear, congenial to my heart, One native charm, than all the gloss of art. GOLDSMITH. I Upon that night, when fairies light On Cassilis Downans dance, Or owre the lays, in splendid blaze, On sprightly coursers prance; Or for Colean the rout is taen, Beneath the moon's pale beams; There, up the Cove, to stray and rove, Amang the rocks and streams To sport that night: II Amang the bonie winding banks, Where Doon rins, wimplin, clear; Where Bruce ance ruled the martial ranks, An' shook his Carrick spear; Some merry, friendly, country-folks Together did convene, To burn their nits, an' pou their stocks, An' haud their Halloween Fu' blythe that night. III The lassies feat an' cleanly neat, Mair braw than when they're fine; Their faces blythe fu' sweetly kythe Hearts leal, an' warm, an' kin': The lads sae trig, wi' wooer-babs Weel-knotted on their garten; Some unco blate, an' some wi' gabs Gar lasses' hearts gang startin Whyles fast at night. IV Then, first an' foremost, thro' the kail, Their stocks maun a' be sought ance; They steek their een, an' grape an' wale For muckle anes, an' straught anes. Poor hav'rel Will fell aff the drift, An' wandered thro' the bow-kail, An' pow't, for want o' better shift, A runt, was like a sow-tail, Sae bow't that night. V Then, straught or crooked, yird or nane, They roar an' cry a' throu'ther; The vera wee-things, toddlin, rin Wi' stocks out-owre their shouther: An' gif the custock's sweet or sour, Wi' joctelegs they taste them; Syne coziely, aboon the door, Wi' cannie care, they've plac'd them To lie that night. VI The lasses staw frae 'mang them a', To pou their stalks o' corn; But Rab slips out, an' jinks about, Behint the muckle thorn: He grippet Nelly hard an' fast; Loud skirl'd a' the lasses; But her tap-pickle maist was lost, Whan kiutlin in the fause-house Wi' him that night. VII The auld guid-wife's weel-hoordet nits Are round an' round divided, An' monie lads' an' lasses' fates Are there that night decided: Some kindle couthie, side by side, An' burn thegither trimly; Some start awa wi' saucy pride, An' jump out-owre the chimlie Fu' high that night. VIII Jean slips in twa, wi' tentie e'e; Wha 'twas, she wadna tell; But this is Jock, an' this is me, She says in to hersel: He bleez'd owre her, an' she owre him, As they wad never mair part; Till fuff! he started up the lum, And Jean had e'en a sair heart To see't that night. IX Poor Willie, wi' his bow-kail runt, Was burnt wi' primsie Mallie; An' Mary, nae doubt, took the drunt, To be compar'd to Willie: Mall's nit lap out, wi' pridefu' fling, An' her ain fit, it burnt it; While Willie lap, an' swoor by jing, 'Twas just the way he wanted To be that night. X Nell had the fause-house in her min', She pits hersel an' Rob in; In loving bleeze they sweetly join, Till white in ase they're sobbin: Nell's heart was dancin at the view; She whisper'd Rob to leuk for't: Rob, stownlins, prie'd her bonie mou, Fu' cozie in the neuk for't, Unseen that night. XI But Merran sat behint their backs, Her thoughts on Andrew Bell; She lea'es them gashing at their cracks, An' slips out by hersel: She thro' the yard the nearest taks, An' to the kiln she goes then, An' darklins grapit for the bauks, And in the blue-clue throws then, Right fear't that night. XII An' ay she win't, an' ay she swat— I wat she made nae jaukin; Till something held within the pat, Guid Lord! but she was quakin! But whether 'twas the Deil himsel, Or whether 'twas a bauk-en', Or whether it was Andrew Bell, She did na wait on talkin To spier that night. XIII Wee Jenny to her graunie says, ‘Will ye go wi' me, graunie? I'll eat the apple at the glass, I gat frae uncle Johnie': She fuff't her pipe wi' sic a lunt, In wrath she was sae vap'rin, She notic't na an aizle brunt Her braw, new, worset apron Out thro' that night. XIV ‘Ye little skelpie-limmer's-face! I daur ye try sic sportin, As seek the Foul Thief onie place, For him to spae your fortune: Nae doubt but ye may get a sight! Great cause ye hae to fear it; For monie a ane has gotten a fright, An' liv'd an' died deleeret, On sic a night. XV ‘Ae hairst afore the Sherra-moor, I mind't as weel's yestreen— I was a gilpey then, I'm sure I was na past fyfteen: The simmer had been cauld an' wat, An' stuff was unco green; An' ay a rantin kirn we gat, An' just on Halloween It fell that night. XVI ‘Our stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, A clever, sturdy fallow; His sin gat Eppie Sim wi' wean, That lived in Achmachalla: He gat hemp-seed, I mind it weel, An' he made unco light o't; But monie a day was by himsel, He was sae sairly frighted That vera night.’ XVII Then up gat fechtin Jamie Fleck, An' he swoor by his conscience, That he could saw hemp-seed a peck; For it was a' but nonsense: The auld guidman raught down the pock, An' out a handfu' gied him; Syne bad him slip frae 'mang the folk, Sometime when nae ane see'd him, An' try't that night. XVIII He marches thro' amang the stacks, Tho' he was something sturtin; The graip he for a harrow taks, And haurls at his curpin; And ev'ry now and then, he says, ‘Hemp-seed I saw thee, An' her that is to be my lass Come after me, an' draw thee As fast this night.’ XIX He whistl'd up Lord Lenox' March, To keep his courage cheery; Altho' his hair began to arch, He was sae fley'd an' eerie; Till presently he hears a squeak, An' then a grane an' gruntle; He by his shouther gae a keek, An' tumbl'd wi' a wintle Out-owre that night. XX He roar'd a horrid murder-shout, In dreadfu' desperation! An' young an' auld come rinnin out, An' hear the sad narration: He swoor 'twas hilchin Jean M'Craw, Or crouchie Merran Humphie— Till stop! she trotted thro' them a'; An' wha was it but grumphie Asteer that night? XXI Meg fain wad to the barn gaen, To winn three wechts o' naething; But for to meet the Deil her lane, She pat but little faith in: She gies the herd a pickle nits, An' twa red-cheekit apples, To watch, while for the barn she sets, In hopes to see Tam Kipples That vera night. XXII She turns the key wi' cannie thraw, An' owre the threshold ventures; But first on Sawnie gies a ca', Syne bauldly in she enters: A ratton rattl'd up the wa', An' she cry'd, L?d preserve her! An' ran thro' midden-hole an' a', An' pray'd wi' zeal and fervour Fu' fast that night. XXIII They hoy't out Will, wi' sair advice; They hecht him some fine braw ane; It chane'd the stack he faddom't thrice, Was timmer-propt for thrawin: He taks a swirlie, auld moss-oak For some black gruesome carlin; An' loot a winze, an' drew a stroke, Till skin in blypes cam haurlin Aff's nieves that night. XXIV A wanton widow Leezie was, As cantie as a kittlin; But och! that night, amang the shaws, She gat a fearfu' settlin! She thro' the whins, an' by the cairn, An' owre the hill gaed scrievin; Whare three lairds' lands met at a burn, To dip her left sark-sleeve in Was bent that night. XXV Whyles owre a linn the burnie plays, As thro' the glen it wimpl't; Whyles round a rocky scaur it strays, Whyles in a wiel it dimpl't; Whyles glitter'd to the nightly rays, Wi' bickerin, dancin dazzle; Whyles cookit underneath the braes, Below the spreading hazel Unseen that night. XXVI Amang the brachens, on the brae, Between her an' the moon, The Deil, or else an outler quey, Gat up an' gae a croon: Poor Leezie's heart maist lap the hool; Near lav'rock-height she jumpit, But mist a fit, an' in the pool Out-owre the lugs she plumpit Wi' a plunge that night. XXVII In order, on the clean hearth-stane, The luggies three are ranged; And ev'ry time great care is taen To see them duly changed: Auld uncle John, wha wedlock's joys Sin Mar's-year did desire, Because he gat the toom dish thrice, He heav'd them on the fire In wrath that night. XXVIII Wi' merry sangs, an' friendly cracks, I wat they did na weary; And unco tales, an' funnie jokes— Their sports were cheap an' cheery: Till butter'd sow'ns, wi' fragrant lunt, Set a' their gabs a-steerin; Syne, wi' a social glass o' strunt, They parted aff careerin Fu' blythe that night. THE AULD FARMERS NEW-YEAR MORNING SALUTATION TO HIS AULD MARE, MAGGIE ON GIVING HER THE ACCUSTOMED RIPP OF CORN TO HANSEL IN THE NEW-YEAR I A Guid New-Year I wish thee, Maggie! Hae, there's a ripp to thy auld baggie: Tho' thou's howe-backit now, an' knaggie, I've seen the day Thou could hae gaen like onie staggie, Out-owre the lay. II Tho' now thou's dowie, stiff, an' crazy, An' thy auld hide as white's a daisie, I've seen thee dappl't, sleek an' glaizie, A bonie gray: He should been tight that daur't to raize thee, Ance in a day. III Thou ance was i' the foremost rank, A filly buirdly, steeve, an' swank; An' set weel down a shapely shank As e'er tread yird; An' could hae flown out-owre a stank Like onie bird. IV It's now some nine-an'-twenty year Sin' thou was my guid-father's meere; He gied me thee, o' tocher clear, An' fifty mark; Tho' it was sma', 'twas weel-won gear, An' thou was stark. V When first I gaed to woo my Jenny, Ye then was trottin wi' your minnie: Tho' ye was trickie, slee, an' funnie, Ye ne'er was donsie; But hamely, tawie, quiet, an' cannie, An' unco sonsie. VI That day, ye pranc'd wi' muckle pride, When ye bure hame my bonie bride: An' sweet an' gracefu' she did ride, Wi' maiden air! Kyle-Stewart I could bragged wide, For sic a pair. VII Tho' now ye dow but hoyte and hobble, An' wintle like a saumont-coble, That day, ye was a jinker noble, For heels an' win'! An' ran them till they a' did wauble, Far, far behin'! VIII When thou an' I were young and skiegh, An' stable-meals at fairs were driegh, How thou wad prance, an' snore, an' skriegh, An' tak the road! Town's-bodies ran, an' stood abiegh, An' ca't thee mad. IX When thou was corn't, an' I was mellow, We took the road ay like a swallow: At brooses thou had ne'er a fellow, For pith an' speed; But ev'ry tail thou pay't them hollow, Whare'er thou gaed. X The sma', droop-rumpl't, hunter cattle Might aiblins waur't thee for a brattle; But sax Scotch miles thou try't their mettle, An' gar't them whaizle: Nae whip nor spur, but just a wattle O' saugh or hazle. XI Thou was a noble fittie-lan', As e'er in tug or tow was drawn. Aft thee an' I, in aught hours' gaun, On guid March-weather, Hae turn'd sax rood beside our han' For days thegither. XII Thou never braing't, an' fetch't, an' fliskit; But thy auld tail thou wad hae whiskit, An' spread abreed thy weel-fill'd brisket, Wi' pith an' pow'r; Till sprittie knowes wad rair't, an' riskit, An' slypet owre. XIII When frosts lay lang, an' snaws were deep, An' threaten'd labour back to keep, I gied thy cog a wee bit heap Aboon the timmer: I ken'd my Maggie wad na sleep For that, or simmer. XIV In cart or car thou never reestit; The steyest brae thou wad hae fac't it; Thou never lap, an' sten't, an' breastit, The stood to blaw; But just thy step a wee thing hastit, Thou snoov't awa. XV My plengh is now thy bairntime a', Four gallant brutes as e'er did draw; Forbye sax mae I've sell't awa, That thou hast nurst: They drew me thretteen pund an' twa, The vera warst. XVI Monie a sair darg we twa hae wrought, An' wi' the weary warl' fought! An' monie an anxious day I thought We wad be beat! Yet here to crazy age we're brought, Wi' something yet. XVII An' think na, my auld trusty servan', That now perhaps thou's less deservin, An' thy auld days may end in starvin; For my last fow, A heapet stimpart, I'll reserve ane Laid by for you. XVIII We've worn to crazy years thegither; We'll toyte about wi' ane anither; Wi' tentie care I'll flit thy tether To some hain'd rig, Whare ye may nobly rax your leather Wi' sma' fatigue. THE COTTER'S SATURDAY NIGHT INSCRIBED TO R. AIKEN, ESQ. Let not Ambition mock their useful toil, Their homely joys, and destiny obscure; Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile, The short and simple annals of the poor. GRAY. I My lov'd, my honor'd, much respected friend! No mercenary bard his homage pays; With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end, My dearest meed, a friend's esteem and praise: To you I sing, in simple Scottish lays, The lowly train in life's sequester'd scene; The native feelings strong, the guileless ways; What Aiken in a cottage would have been; Ah! tho' his worth unknown, far happier there I ween! II November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh; The short'ning winter-day is near a close; The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh; The black'ning trains o' craws to their repose: The toil-worn Cotter frae his labor goes— This night his weekly moil is at an end, Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes, Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend, And weary, o'er the moor, his course does hameward bend. III At length his lonely cot appears in view, Beneath the shelter of an aged tree; Th' expectant wee-things, toddlin, stacher through To meet their dad, wi' flichterin' noise and glee. His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie, His clean hearth-stane, his thrifty wifie's smile, The lisping infant, prattling on his knee, Does a' his weary kiaugh and care beguile, And makes him quite forget his labor and his toil. IV Belyve, the elder bairns come drapping in, At service out, amang the farmers roun'; Some ca' the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin A cannie errand to a neebor town: Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman grown, In youthfu' bloom, love sparkling in her e'e, Comes hame; perhaps, to shew a braw new gown, Or deposite her sair-won penny-fee, To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be. V With joy unfeign'd, brothers and sisters meet, And each for other's weelfare kindly spiers: The social hours, swift-wing'd, unnotic'd fleet; Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears. The parents partial eye their hopeful years; Anticipation forward points the view; The mother, wi' her needle and her sheers, Gars auld claes look amaist as weel's the new; The father mixes a' wi' admonition due. VI Their master's and their mistress's command The younkers a' are warned to obey; And mind their labors wi' an eydent hand, And ne'er, tho' out o' sight, to jauk or play: ‘And O! be sure to fear the Lord alway, And mind your duty, duly, morn and night; Lest in temptation's path ye gang astray, Implore His counsel and assisting might: They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright.’ VII But hark! a rap comes gently to the door; Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same. Tells how a neebor lad came o'er the moor, To do some errands, and convoy her hame. The wily mother sees the conscious flame Sparkle in Jenny's e'e, and flush her cheek; With heart-struck anxious care, enquires his name, While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak; Weel-pleas'd the mother hears, it's nae wild, worthless rake. VIII With kindly welcome, Jenny brings him ben; A strappin' youth, he takes the mother's eye; Blythe Jenny sees the visit's no ill taen; The father cracks of horses, pleughs, and kye. The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy, But blate and laithfu', scarce can weel behave; The mother, wi' a woman's wiles, can spy What makes the youth sae bashfu' and sae grave; Weel-pleas'd to think her bairn's respected like the lave. IX O happy love! where love like this is found: O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare! I've pacèd much this weary, mortal round, And sage experience bids me this declare:— ‘If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare, One cordial in this melancholy vale, 'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair, In other's arms, breathe out the tender tale Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the ev'ning gale.’ X Is there, in human form, that bears a heart, A wretch! a villain! lost to love and truth! That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art, Betray sweet Jenny's unsuspecting youth? Curse on his perjur'd arts! dissembling, smooth! Are honor, virtue, conscience, all exil'd? Is there no pity, no relenting ruth, Points to the parents fondling o'er their child? Then paints the ruin'd maid, and their distraction wild? XI But now the supper crowns their simple board, The healsome parritch, chief o' Scotia's food; The soupe their only hawkie does afford, That, 'yont the hallan snugly chows her cood; The dame brings forth, in complimental mood, To grace the lad, her weel-hain'd kebbuck, fell; And aft he's prest, and aft he ca's it guid; The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell, How 'twas a towmond auld, sin' lint was i' the bell. XII The chearfu' supper done, wi' serious face, They, round the ingle, form a circle wide; The sire turns o'er, wi' patriarchal grace, The big na'-Bible, ance his father's pride. His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside, His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare; Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide, He wales a portion with judicious care, And ‘Let us worship God!’ he says, with solemn air. XIII They chant their artless notes in simple guise, They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim; Perhaps Dundee's wild-warbling measures rise, Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name; Or noble Elgin beets the heaven-ward flame, The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays: Compar'd with these, Italian trills are tame; The tickl'd ears no heart-felt raptures raise; Nae unison hae they, with our Creator's praise. XIV The priest-like father reads the sacred page, How Abram was the friend of God on high; Or, Moses bade eternal warfare wage With Amalek's ungracious progeny; Or, how the royal Bard did groaning lie Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire; Or Job's pathetic plaint, and wailing cry; Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire; Or other holy Seers that tune the sacred lyre. XV Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme: How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed; How He, who bore in Heaven the second name, Had not on earth whereon to lay His head; How His first followers and servants sped; The precepts sage they wrote to many a land: How he, who lone in Patmos banishèd, Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand, And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounc'd by Heaven's command. XVI Then kneeling down to Heaven's Eternal King, The saint, the father, and the husband prays: Hope ‘springs exulting on triumphant wing,’ That thus they all shall meet in future days, There, ever bask in uncreated rays, No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear, Together hymning their Creator's praise, In such society, yet still more dear; While circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere. XVII Compar'd with this, how poor Religion's pride, In all the pomp of method, and of art; When men display to congregations wide Devotion's ev'ry grace, except the heart The Power, incens'd, the pageant will desert, The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole: But haply, in some cottage far apart, May hear, well-pleas'd, the language of the soul, And in His Book of Life the inmates poor enroll. XVIII Then homeward all take off their sev'ral way; The youngling cottagers retire to rest: The parent-pair their secret homage pay, And proffer up to Heaven the warm request, That He who stills the raven's clam'rous nest, And decks the lily fair in flow'ry pride, Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best, For them and for their little ones provide; But, chiefly, in their hearts with Grace Divine preside. XIX From scenes like these, old Scotia's grandeur springs, That makes her lov'd at home, rever'd abroad: Princes and lords are but the breath of kings, ‘An honest man's the noblest work of God’; And certes, in fair Virtue's heavenly road, The cottage leaves the palace far behind; What is a lordling's pomp? a cumbrous load, Disguising oft the wretch of human kind, Studied in arts of Hell, in wickedness refin'd! XX O Scotia! my dear, my native soil! For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent! Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil Be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content! And O! may Heaven their simple lives prevent From Luxury's contagion, weak and vile! Then, howe'er crowns and coronets be rent, A virtuous populace may rise the while, And stand a wall of fire around their much-lov'd Isle. XXI O Thou! who pour'd the patriotic tide, That stream'd thro' Wallace's undaunted heart, Who dar'd to, nobly, stem tyrannic pride, Or nobly die, the second glorious part: (The patriot's God, peculiarly Thou art, His friend, inspirer, guardian, and reward!) O never, never Scotia's realm desert; But still the patriot, and the patriot-bard In bright succession raise, her ornament and guard! TO A MOUSE ON TURNING HER UP IN HER NEST WITH THE PLOUGH, NOVEMBER 1785 I Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie, O, what a panic's in thy breastie! Thou need na start awa sae hasty Wi' bickering brattle! I wad be laith to rin an' chase thee, Wi' murdering pattle! II I'm truly sorry man's dominion Has broken Nature's social union, An' justifies that ill opinion Which makes thee startle At me, thy poor, earth-born companion An' fellow mortal! III I doubt na, whyles, but thou may thieve; What then? poor beastie, thou maun live! A daimen icker in a thrave 'S a sma' request; I'll get a blessin wi' the lave, An' never miss't! IV Thy wee-bit housie, too, in ruin! Its silly wa's the win's are strewin! An' naething, now, to big a new ane, O' foggage green! An' bleak December's win's ensuin, Baith snell an' keen! V Thou saw the fields laid bare an' waste, An' weary winter comin fast, An' cozie here, beneath the blast, Thou thought to dwell, Till crash! the cruel coulter past Out thro' thy cell. VI That wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble, Has cost thee monie a weary nibble! Now thou's turned out, for a' thy trouble, But house or hald, To thole the winter's sleety dribble, An' cranreuch cauld! VII But Mousie, thou art no thy lane, In proving foresight may be vain: The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men Gang aft agley, An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain, For promis'd joy! VIII Still thou art blest, compared wi' me! The present only toucheth thee: But och! I backward cast my e'e, On prospects drear! An' forward, tho' I canna see, I guess an' fear! EPISTLE TO DAVIE, A BROTHER POET JANUARY I While winds frae aff Ben-Lomond blaw, And bar the doors wi' drivin' snaw, And hing us owre the ingle, I set me down to pass the time, And spin a verse or twa o' rhyme, In hamely, westlin jingle: While frosty winds blaw in the drift, Ben to the chimla lug, I grudge a wee the great-folk's gift, That live sae bien an' snug: I tent less, and want less Their roomy fire-side; But hanker, and canker, To see their cursed pride. II It's hardly in a body's pow'r, To keep, at times, frae being sour, To see how things are shar'd; How best o' chiels are whyles in want, While coofs on countless thousands rant, And ken na how to ware't; But Davie, lad, ne'er fash your head, Tho' we hae little gear; We're fit to win our daily bread, As lang's we're hale and fier: ‘Mair spier na, nor fear na,’ Auld age ne'er mind a feg; The last o't, the warst o't, Is only but to beg. III To lie in kilns and barns at e'en, When banes are craz'd, and bluid is thin, Is, doubtless, great distress! Yet then content could make us blest; Ev'n then, sometimes, we'd snatch a taste Of truest happiness. The honest heart that's free frae a' Intended fraud or guile, However Fortune kick the ba', Has ay some cause to smile; And mind still, you'll find still, A comfort this nae sma'; Nae mair then, we'll care then, Nae farther can we fa'. IV What tho', like commoners of air, We wander out, we know not where, But either house or hal'? Yet Nature's charms, the hills and woods, The sweeping vales, and foaming floods, Are free alike to all. In days when daisies deck the ground, And blackbirds whistle clear, With honest joy our hearts will bound, To see the coming year: On braes when we please then, We'll sit an' sowth a tune; Syne rhyme till't we'll time till't, An' sing't when we hae done. V It's no in titles nor in rank: It's no in wealth like Lon'on Bank, To purchase peace and rest. It's no in makin muckle, mair; It's no in books, it's no in lear, To make us truly blest: If happiness hae not her seat An' centre in the breast, We may be wise, or rich, or great, But never can be blest! Nae treasures nor pleasures Could make us happy lang; The heart ay's the part ay That makes us right or wrang. VI Think ye, that sic as you and I, Wha drudge and drive thro' wet and dry, Wi' never ceasing toil; Think ye, are we less blest than they, Wha scarcely tent us in their way, As hardly worth their while? Alas! how oft, in haughty mood, God's creatures they oppress! Or else, neglecting a' that's guid, They riot in excess! Baith careless and fearless Of either Heaven or Hell; Esteeming and deeming It a' an idle tale! VII Then let us chearfu' acquiesce, Nor make our scanty pleasures less By pining at our state: And, even should misfortunes come, I here wha sit hae met wi' some, An's thankfu' for them yet, They gie the wit of age to youth; They let us ken oursel; They make us see the naked truth, The real guid and ill: Tho' losses and crosses Be lessons right severe, There's wit there, ye'll get there, Ye'll find nae other where. VIII But tent me, Davie, ace o' hearts! (To say aught less wad wrang the cartes, And flatt'ry I detest) This life has joys for you and I; And joys that riches ne'er could buy, And joys the very best. There's a' the pleasures o' the heart, The lover an' the frien': Ye hae your Meg, your dearest part, And I my darling Jean! It warms me, it charms me To mention but her name: It heats me, it beets me, And sets me a' on flame! IX O all ye Pow'rs who rule above! O Thou whose very self art love! Thou know'st my words sincere! The life-blood streaming thro' my heart, Or my more dear immortal part, Is not more fondly dear! When heart-corroding care and grief Deprive my soul of rest, Her dear idea brings relief And solace to my breast. Thou Being All-seeing, O, hear my fervent pray'r! Still take her, and make her Thy most peculiar care! X All hail! ye tender feelings dear! The smile of love, the friendly tear, The sympathetic glow! Long since, this world's thorny ways Had number'd out my weary days, Had it not been for you! Fate still has blest me with a friend In every care and ill; And oft a more endearing band, A tie more tender still. It lightens, it brightens The tenebrific scene, To meet with, and greet with My Davie or my Jean! XI O, how that Name inspires my style! The words come skelpin' rank an' file, Amaist before I ken! The ready measure rins as fine, As Phœbus and the famous Nine Were glowrin owre my pen. My spaviet Pegasus will limp, Till ance he's fairly het; And then he'll hilch, an' stilt, an' jimp, And rin an unco fit; But least then, the beast then Should rue this hasty ride, I'll light now, and dight now His sweaty, wizen'd hide. THE LAMENT OCCASIONED BY THE UNFORTUNATE ISSUE OF A FRIEND'S AMOUR Alas! how oft does Goodness wound itself, And sweet Affection prove the spring of Woe! HOME. I O thou pale Orb that silent shines While care-untroubled mortals sleep! Thou seest a wretch who inly pines, And wanders here to wail and weep! With Woe I nightly vigils keep, Beneath thy wan, unwarming beam; And mourn, in lamentation deep, How life and love are all a dream! II I joyless view thy rays adorn The faintly-markèd, distant hill; I joyless view thy trembling horn Reflected in the gurgling rill: My fondly-fluttering heart, be still! Thou busy pow'r, Remembrance, cease! Ah! must the agonizing thrill For ever bar returning Peace? III No idly-feign'd, poetic pains My sad, love-lorn lamentings claim: No shepherd's pipe—Arcadian strains; No fabled tortures quaint and tame. The plighted faith, the mutual flame, The oft-attested Pow'rs above, The promis'd father's tender name, These were the pledges of my love! IV Encircled in her clasping arms, How have the raptur'd moments flown! How have I wished for Fortune's charms, For her dear sake, and her's alone! And, must I think it! is she gone, My secret heart's exulting boast? And does she heedless hear my groan? And is she ever, ever lost? V O! can she bear so base a heart, So lost to honour, lost to truth, As from the fondest lover part, The plighted husband of her youth? Alas! Life's path may be unsmooth! Her way may lie thro' rough distress! Then, who her pangs and pains will soothe, Her sorrows share, and make them less? VI Ye wingèd Hours that o'er us pass'd, Enraptur'd more the more enjoy'd, Your dear remembrance in my breast My fondly treasur'd thoughts employ'd: That breast, how dreary now, and void, For her too scanty once of room! Ev'n ev'ry ray of Hope destroy'd, And not a wish to gild the gloom! VII The morn, that warns th'approaching day, Awakes me up to toil and woe; I see the hours in long array, That I must suffer, lingering slow: Full many a pang, and many a throe, Keen Recollection's direful train, Must wring my soul, ere Phœbus, low, Shall kiss the distant western main. VIII And when my nightly couch I try, Sore-harass'd out with care and grief, My toil-beat nerves and tear-worn eye Keep watchings with the nightly thief: Or, if I slumber, Fancy, chief, Reigns, haggard-wild, in sore affright: Ev'n day, all-bitter, brings relief From such a horror-breathing night. IX O thou bright Queen, who, o'er th'expanse Now highest reign'st, with boundless sway! Oft has thy silent-marking glance Observ'd us, fondly-wand'ring, stray! The time, unheeded, sped away, While Love's luxurious pulse beat high, Beneath thy silver-gleaming ray, To mark the mutual-kindling eye. X O scenes in strong remembrance set! Scenes, never, never to return! Scenes if in stupor I forget, Again I feel, again I burn! From ev'ry joy and pleasure torn, Life's weary vale I wander thro'; And hopeless, comfortless, I'll mourn A faithless woman's broken vow! DESPONDENCY An Ode I Oppress'd with grief, oppress'd with care, A burden more than I can bear, I set me down and sigh; O Life! thou art a galling load, Along a rough, a weary road, To wretches such as I! Dim-backward, as I cast my view, What sick'ning scenes appear! What sorrows yet may pierce me thro', Too justly I may fear! Still caring, despairing, Must be my bitter doom; My woes here shall close ne'er But with the closing tomb! II Happy ye sons of busy life, Who, equal to the bustling strife, No other view regard! Ev'n when the wishèd end's denied, Yet while the busy means are plied, They bring their own reward: Whilst I, a hope-abandoned wight, Unfitted with an aim, Meet ev'ry sad returning night And joyless morn the same. You, bustling and justling, Forget each grief and pain; I, listless yet restless, Find ev'ry prospect vain. III How blest the Solitary's lot, Who, all-forgetting, all-forgot, Within his humble cell— The cavern, wild with tangling roots— Sits o'er his newly-gather'd fruits, Beside his crystal well! Or haply to his ev'ning thought, By unfrequented stream, The ways of men are distant brought, A faint-collected dream; While praising, and raising His thoughts to Heav'n on high, As wand'ring, meand'ring, He views the solemn sky. IV Than I, no lonely hermit plac'd Where never human footstep trac'd, Less fit to play the part; The lucky moment to improve, And just to stop, and just to move, With self-respecting art: But ah! those pleasures, loves, and joys, Which I too keenly taste, The Solitary can despise— Can want and yet be blest! He needs not, he heeds not Or human love or hate; Whilst I here must cry here At perfidy ingrate! V O enviable early days, When dancing thoughtless pleasure's maze, To care, to guilt unknown! How ill exchang'd for riper times, To feel the follies or the crimes Of others, or my own! Ye tiny elves that guiltless sport, Like linnets in the bush, Ye little know the ills ye court, When manhood is your wish! The losses, the crosses That active man engage; The fears all, the tears all Of dim declining Age! MAN WAS MADE TO MOURN A Dirge I When chill November's surly blast Made fields and forests bare, One ev'ning, as I wand'red forth Along the banks of Ayr, I spied a man, whose aged step Seem'd weary, worn with care, His face was furrow'd o'er with years, And hoary was his hair. II ‘Young stranger, whither wand'rest thou?’ Began the rev'rend Sage; ‘Does thirst of wealth thy step constrain, Or youthful pleasure's rage? Or haply, prest with cares and woes, Too soon thou hast began To wander forth, with me to mourn The miseries of Man. III ‘The sun that overhangs yon moors, Out-spreading far and wide, Where hundreds labour to support A haughty lordling's pride: I've seen yon weary winter-sun Twice forty times return; And ev'ry time has added proofs, That Man was made to mourn. IV ‘O Man! while in thy early years, How prodigal of time! Mis-spending all thy precious hours, Thy glorious, youthful prime! Alternate follies take the sway, Licentious passions burn: Which tenfold force gives Nature's law, That Man was made to mourn. V ‘Look not alone on youthful prime, Or manhood's active might; Man then is useful to his kind, Supported is his right: But see him on the edge of life, With cares and sorrows worn; Then Age and Want—O ill-match'd pair!— Shew Man was made to mourn. VI ‘A few seem favourites of Fate, In Pleasure's lap carest; Yet think not all the rich and great Are likewise truly blest: But oh! what crowds in ev'ry land, All wretched and forlorn, Thro' weary life this lesson learn, That Man was made to mourn. VII ‘Many and sharp the num'rous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret, remorse, and shame! And Man, whose heav'n-erected face The smiles of love adorn,— Man's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn! VIII ‘See yonder poor, o'erlabour'd wight, So abject, mean, and vile, Who begs a brother of the earth To give him leave to toil; And see his lordly fellow-worm The poor petition spurn, Unmindful, tho' a weeping wife And helpless offspring mourn. IX ‘If I'm design'd yon lordling's slave— By Nature's law design'd— Why was an independent wish E'er planted in my mind? If not, why am I subject to His cruelty, or scorn? Or why has Man the will and pow'r To make his fellow mourn? X ‘Yet let not this too much, my son, Disturb thy youthful breast: This partial view of human-kind Is surely not the last! The poor, oppressèd, honest man Had never, sure, been born, Had there not been some recompense To comfort those that mourn! XI ‘O Death! the poor man's dearest friend, The kindest and the best! Welcome the hour my agèd limbs Are laid with thee at rest! The great, the wealthy fear thy blow, From pomp and pleasure torn; But, oh! a blest relief to those That weary-laden mourn!’ WINTER A Dirge I The wintry west extends his blast, And hail and rain does blaw; Or the stormy north sends driving forth The blinding sleet and snaw: Wild-tumbling brown, the burn comes down, And roars frae bank to brae: While bird and beast in covert rest, And pass the heartless day. II ‘The sweeping blast, the sky o'ercast,’ The joyless winter day Let others fear, to me more dear Than all the pride of May: The tempest's howl, it soothes my soul, My griefs it seems to join; The leafless trees my fancy please, Their fate resembles mine! III Thou Pow'r Supreme, whose mighty scheme These woes of mine fulfill, Here, firm I rest, they must be best, Because they are Thy will! Then all I want (O, do Thou grant This one request of mine!): Since to enjoy Thou dost deny, Assist me to resign. A PRAYER IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH O Thou unknown, Almighty Cause Of all my hope and fear! In whose dread presence, ere an hour, Perhaps I must appear! If I have wander'd in those paths Of life I ought to shun— As something, loudly, in my breast, Remonstrates I have done— Thou know'st that Thou hast forméd me With passions wild and strong; And list'ning to their witching voice Has often led me wrong. Where human weakness has come short, Or frailty stept aside, Do Thou, All-good—for such Thou art— In shades of darkness hide. Where with intention I have err'd, No other plea I have, But, Thou art good; and Goodness still Delighteth to forgive. TO A MOUNTAIN DAISY ON TURNING ONE DOWN WITH THE PLOUGH IN APRIL, 1786 I Wee, modest, crimson-tippèd flow'r, Thou's met me in an evil hour; For I maun crush amang the stoure Thy slender stem: To spare thee now is past my pow'r, Thou bonie gem. II Alas! it's no thy neebor sweet, The bonie lark, companion meet, Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet, Wi' spreckl'd breast! When upward-springing, blythe, to greet The purpling east. III Cauld blew the bitter-biting north Upon thy early, humble birth; Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth Amid the storm, Scarce rear'd above the parent-earth Thy tender form. IV The flaunting flow'rs our gardens yield, High shelt'ring woods and wa's maun shield; But thou, beneath the random bield O' clod or stane, Adorns the histie stibble-field, Unseen, alane. V There, in thy scanty mantle clad, Thy snawie bosom sun-ward spread, Thou lifts thy unassuming head In humble guise; But now the share uptears thy bed, And low thou lies! VI Such is the fate of artless maid, Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade! By love's simplicity betray'd, And guileless trust; Till she, like thee, all soil'd, is laid Low i' the dust. VII Such is the fate of simple Bard, On Life's rough ocean luckless starr'd! Unskilful he to note the card Of prudent lore, Till billows rage, and gales blow hard, And whelm him o'er! VIII Such fate to suffering Worth is giv'n, Who long with wants and woes has striv'n, By human pride or cunning driv'n To mis'ry's brink; Till, wrench'd of ev'ry stay but Heav'n, He, ruin'd, sink! IX Ev'n thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate, That fate is thine—no distant date; Stern Ruin's plough-share drives elate, Full on thy bloom, Till crush'd beneath the furrow's weight Shall be thy doom! TO RUIN I All hail, inexorable lord! At whose destruction-breathing word, The mightiest empires fall! Thy cruel, woe-delighted train, The ministers of grief and pain, A sullen welcome, all! With stern-resolv'd, despairing eye, I see each aimèd dart; For one has cut my dearest tie, And quivers in my heart. Then low'ring and pouring, The storm no more I dread; Tho' thick'ning and black'ning Round my devoted head. II And thou grim Pow'r, by Life abhorr'd, While Life a pleasure can afford, O! hear a wretch's pray'r! No more I shrink appall'd, afraid; I court, I beg thy friendly aid, To close this scene of care! When shall my soul, in silent peace, Resign Life's joyless day? My weary heart its throbbings cease, Cold-mould'ring in the clay? No fear more, no tear more To stain my lifeless face, Enclaspèd and graspèd Within thy cold embrace! EPISTLE TO A YOUNG FRIEND May ? 1786. I I lang hae thought, my youthfu' friend, A something to have sent you, Tho' it should serve nae ither end Than just a kind memento: But how the subject-theme may gang, Let time and chance determine: Perhaps it may turn out a sang; Perhaps, turn out a sermon. II Ye'll try the world soon, my lad; And, Andrew dear, believe me, Ye'll find mankind an unco squad, And muckle they may grieve ye: For care and trouble set your thought, Ev'n when your end's attainéd; And a' your views may come to nought, Where ev'ry nerve is strainéd. III I'll no say, men are villains a': The real, harden'd wicked, Wha hae nae check but human law, Are to a few restricked; But, och! mankind are unco weak An' little to be trusted; If Self the wavering balance shake, It's rarely right adjusted! IV Yet they wha fa' in Fortune's strife, Their fate we should na censure; For still, th'important end of life They equally may answer: A man may hae an honest heart, Tho' poortith hourly stare him; A man may tak a neebor's part, Yet hae nae cash to spare him. V Ay free, aff han', your story tell, When wi' a bosom cronie; But still keep something to yoursel Ye scarcely tell to onie: Conceal yoursel as weel's ye can Frae critical dissection: But keek thro' ev'ry other man Wi' sharpen'd, sly inspection. VI The sacred lowe o' weel-plac'd love, Luxuriantly indulge it; But never tempt th'illicit rove, Tho' naething should divulge it: I waive the quantum o' the sin, The hazard of concealing; But, och! it hardens a' within, And petrifies the feeling! VII To catch Dame Fortune's golden smile, Assiduous wait upon her; And gather gear by ev'ry wile That's justify'd by honor: Not for to hide it in a hedge, Nor for a train-attendant; But for the glorious privilege Of being independent. VIII The fear o' Hell's a hangman's whip To haud the wretch in order; But where ye feel your honour grip, Let that ay be your border: Its slightest touches, instant pause— Debar a' side-pretences; And resolutely keep its laws, Uncaring consequences. IX The great Creator to revere Must sure become the creature; But still the preaching cant forbear, And ev'n the rigid feature: Yet ne'er with wits profane to range Be complaisance extended; An atheist-laugh's a poor exchange For Deity offended! X When ranting round in Pleasure's ring, Religion may be blinded; Or if she gie a random sting, It may be little minded; But when on Life we're tempest-driv'n— A conscience but a canker— A correspondence fix'd wi' Heav'n Is sure a noble anchor! XI Adieu, dear, amiable youth! Your heart can ne'er be wanting! May prudence, fortitude, and truth, Erect your brow undaunting! In ploughman phrase, ‘God send you speed,’ Still daily to grow wiser; And may ye better reck the rede, Than ever did th'adviser! ON A SCOTCH BARD GONE TO THE WEST INDIES I A' ye wha live by sowps o' drink, A' ye wha live by crambo-clink, A' ye wha live and never think, Come, mourn wi' me! Our billie's gien us a' a jink, An' owre the sea! II Lament him a' ye rantin core, Wha dearly like a random-splore; Nae mair he'll join the merry roar In social key; For now he's taen anither shore, An' owre the sea! III The bonie lasses weel may wiss him, And in their dear petitions place him: The widows, wives, an' a' may bless him Wi' tearfu' e'e, For weel I wat they'll sairly miss him That's owre the sea! IV O Fortune, they hae room to grumble! Hadst thou taen aff some drowsy bummle, Wha can do nought but fyke an' fumble, 'Twad been nae plea; But he was gleg as onie wumble, That's owre the sea! V Auld, cantie Kyle may weepers wear, An' stain them wi' the saut, saut tear: 'Twill mak her poor auld heart, I fear, In flinders flee: He was her Laureat monie a year, That's owre the sea! VI He saw Misfortune's cauld nor-west Lang-mustering up a bitter blast; A jillet brak his heart at last, Ill may she be! So, took a birth afore the mast, An' owre the sea. VII To tremble under Fortune's cummock, On scarce a bellyfu' o' drummock, Wi' his proud, independent stomach, Could ill agree; So, row't his hurdies in a hammock, An' owre the sea. VIII He ne'er was gien to great misguiding, Yet coin his pouches wad na bide in; Wi' him it ne'er was under hiding, He dealt it free: The Muse was a' that he took pride in, That's owre the sea. IX Jamaica bodies, use him weel, An' hap him in a cozie biel: Ye'll find him ay a dainty chiel, An' fou o' glee: He wad na wrang'd the vera Deil, That's owre the sea. X Fareweel, my rhyme-composing billie! Your native soil was right ill-willie; But may ye flourish like a lily, Now bonilie! I'll toast you in my hindmost gillie, Tho' owre the sea! A DEDICATION TO GAVIN HAMILTON, ESQ. Expect na, Sir, in this narration, A fleechin, fleth'rin Dedication, To roose you up, an' ca' you guid, An' sprung o' great an' noble bluid, Because ye're surnam'd like His Grace, Perhaps related to the race: Then, when I'm tired—and sae are ye, Wi' monie a fulsome, sinfu' lie— Set up a face how I stop short, For fear your modesty be hurt. This may do—maun do, Sir, wi' them wha Maun please the great-folk for a wamefou'; For me! sae laigh I need na bow, For, Lord be thankit, I can plough; And when I downa yoke a naig, Then, Lord be thankit, I can beg; Sae I shall say, an' that's nae flatt'rin, It's just sic poet an' sic patron. The Poet, some guid angel help him, Or else, I fear, some ill ane skelp him! He may do weel for a' he's done yet, But only he's no just begun yet. The Patron (sir, ye maun forgie me; I winna lie, come what will o' me), On ev'ry hand it will allow'd be, He's just—nae better than he should be. I readily and freely grant, He downa see a poor man want; What's no his ain he winna tak it; What ance he says, he winna break it; Ought he can lend he'll no refus't, Till aft his guidness is abus'd; And rascals whyles that do him wrang, Ev'n that, he does na mind it lang; As master, landlord, husband, father, He does na fail his part in either. But then, nae thanks to him for a' that Nae godly symptom ye can ca' that; It's naething but a milder feature Of our poor, sinfu', corrupt nature: Ye'll get the best o' moral works, 'Mang black Gentoos, and pagan Turks, Or hunters wild on Ponotaxi, Wha never heard of orthodoxy. That he's the poor man's friend in need, The gentleman in word and deed, It's no thro' terror of damnation: It's just a carnal inclination, And och! that's nae regeneration. Morality, thou deadly bane, Thy tens o' thousands thou hast slain! Vain is his hope, whase stay an' trust is In moral mercy, truth, and justice! No—stretch a point to catch a plack; Abuse a brother to his back; Steal thro' the winnock frae a whore, But point the rake that taks the door; Be to the poor like onie whunstane, And haud their noses to the grunstane; Ply ev'ry art o' legal thieving; No matter—stick to sound believing. Learn three-mile pray'rs, an' half-mile graces, Wi' weel-spread looves, an' lang, wry faces; Grunt up a solemn, lengthen'd groan, And damn a' parties but your own; I'll warrant then, ye're nae deceiver, A steady, sturdy, staunch believer. O ye wha leave the springs o' Calvin, For gumlie dubs of your ain delvin! Ye sons of Heresy and Error, Ye'll some day squeel in quaking terror, When Vengeance draws the sword in wrath, And in the fire throws the sheath; When Ruin, with his sweeping besom, Just frets till Heav'n commission gies him; While o'er the harp pale Misery moans, And strikes the ever-deep'ning tones, Still louder shrieks, and heavier groans! Your pardon, sir, for this digression: I maist forgat my Dedication; But when divinity comes 'cross me, My readers still are sure to lose me. So, Sir, you see 'twas nae daft vapour; But I maturely thought it proper, When a' my works I did review, To dedicate them, Sir, to you: Because (ye need na tak' it ill), I thought them something like yoursel. Then patronize them wi' your favor, And your petitioner shall ever— I had amaist said, ever pray, But that's a word I need na say; For prayin, I hae little skill o't, I'm baith dead-sweer, an' wretched ill o't; But I'se repeat each poor man's pray'r, That kens or hears about you, Sir:— ‘May ne'er Misfortune's gowling bark Howl thro' the dwelling o' the clerk! May ne'er his gen'rous, honest heart, For that same gen'rous spirit smart! May Kennedy's far-honor'd name Lang beet his hymeneal flame, Till Hamiltons, at least a dizzen, Are frae their nuptial labors risen: Five bonie lasses round their table, And sev'n braw fellows, stout an' able, To serve their king an' country weel, By word, or pen, or pointed steel! May Health and Peace, with mutual rays, Shine on the ev'ning o' his days; Till his wee, curlie John's ier-oe, When ebbing life nae mair shall flow, The last, sad, mournful rites bestow!’ I will not wind a lang conclusion, With complimentary effusion; But, whilst your wishes and endeavours Are blest with Fortune's smiles and favours, I am, dear sir, with zeal most fervent, Your much indebted, humble servant. But if (which Pow'rs above prevent) That iron-hearted carl, Want, Attended, in his grim advances, By sad mistakes, and black mischances, While hopes, and joys, and pleasures fly him, Make you as poor a dog as I am, Your ‘humble servant’ then no more; For who would humbly serve the poor? But, by a poor man's hopes in Heav'n! While recollection's pow'r is giv'n, If, in the vale of humble life, The victim sad of Fortune's strife, I, thro' the tender-gushing tear, Should recognise my master dear; If friendless, low, we meet together, Then, sir, your hand—my Friend and Brother! TO A LOUSE ON SEEING ONE ON A LADY'S BONNET AT CHURCH I Ha! whare ye gaun, ye crowlin ferlie? Your impudence protects you sairly, I canna say but ye strunt rarely Owre gauze and lace, Tho' faith! I fear ye dine but sparely On sic a place. II Ye ugly, creepin, blastit wonner, Detested, shunn'd by saunt an' sinner, How daur ye set your fit upon her— Sae fine a lady! Gae somewhere else and seek your dinner On some poor body. III Swith! in some beggar's hauffet squattle: There ye may creep, and sprawl, and sprattle, Wi' ither kindred, jumping cattle, In shoals and nations; Whare horn nor bane ne'er daur unsettle Your thick plantations. IV Now haud you there! ye're out o' sight, Below the fatt'rils, snug an' tight; Na, faith ye yet! ye'll no be right, Till ye've got on it— The vera tapmost, tow'ring height O' Miss's bonnet. V My sooth! right bauld ye set your nose out, As plump an' grey as onie grozet: O for some rank, mercurial rozet, Or fell, red smeddum, I'd gie ye sic a hearty dose o't, Wad dress your droddum. VI I wad na been surpris'd to spy You on an auld wife's flainen toy; Or aiblins some bit duddie boy, On's wyliecoat; But Miss's fine Lunardi! fye! How daur ye do't? VII O Jenny, dinna toss your head, An' set your beauties a' abread! Ye little ken what cursèd speed The blastie's makin! Thae winks an' finger-ends, I dread, Are notice takin! VIII O wad some Power the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us! It wad frae monie a blunder free us, An' foolish notion: What airs in dress an' gait wad lea'e us, An' ev'n devotion! EPISTLE TO J. LAPRAIK AN OLD SCOTTISH BARD, APRIL 1, 1785 I While briers an' woodbines budding green, And paitricks scraichin loud at e'en, An' morning poussie whiddin seen, Inspire my Muse, This freedom, in an unknown frien' I pray excuse. II On Fasten-e'en we had a rockin, To ca' the crack and weave our stockin; And there was muckle fun and jokin, Ye need na doubt; At length we had a hearty yokin, At ‘sang about.’ III There was ae sang, amang the rest, Aboon them a' it pleas'd me best, That some kind husband had addrest To some sweet wife: It thirl'd the heart-strings thro' the breast, A' to the life. IV I've scarce heard ought describ'd sae weel, What gen'rous, manly bosoms feel; Thought I, ‘Can this be Pope or Steele, Or Beattie's wark?’ They tald me 'twas an odd kind chiel About Muirkirk. V It pat me fidgin-fain to hear't, An' sae about him there I spier't; Then a' that kent him round declar'd He had ingine; That nane excell'd it, few cam near't, It was sae fine: VI That, set him to a pint of ale, An' either douce or merry tale, Or rhymes an' sangs he'd made himsel, Or witty catches, 'Tween Inverness an' Teviotdale, He had few matches. VII Then up I gat, an' swoor an aith, Tho' I should pawn my pleugh an' graith, Or die a cadger pownie's death, At some dyke-back, A pint an' gill I'd gie them baith, To hear your crack. VIII But, first an' foremost, I should tell, Amaist as soon as I could spell, I to the crambo-jingle fell; Tho' rude an' rough— Yet crooning to a body's sel, Does weel eneugh. IX I am nae poet, in a sense; But just a rhymer like by chance, An' hae to learning nae pretence; Yet, what the matter? Whene'er my Muse does on me glance, I jingle at her. X Your critic-folk may cock their nose, And say, ‘How can you e'er propose, You wha ken hardly verse frae prose, To mak a sang?’ But, by your leaves, my learned foes, Ye're maybe wrang. XI What's a' your jargon o' your Schools, Your Latin names for horns an' stools? If honest Nature made you fools, What sairs your grammers? Ye'd better taen up spades and shools, Or knappin-hammers. XII A set o' dull, conceited hashes Confuse their brains in college-classes, They gang in stirks, and come out asses, Plain truth to speak; An' syne they think to climb Parnassus By dint o' Greek! XIII Gie me ae spark o' Nature's fire, That's a' the learning I desire; Then, tho' I drudge thro' dub an' mire At pleugh or cart, My Muse, tho' hamely in attire, May touch the heart. XIV O for a spunk o' Allan's glee, Or Fergusson's, the bauld an' slee, Or bright Lapraik's, my friend to be, If I can hit it! That would be lear eneugh for me, If I could get it. XV Now, sir, if ye hae friends enow, Tho' real friends I b'lieve are few; Yet, if your catalogue be fow, I'se no insist: But, gif ye want ae friend that's true, I'm on your list. XVI I winna blaw about mysel, As ill I like my fauts to tell; But friends, an' folks that wish me well, They sometimes roose me; Tho', I maun own, as monie still As far abuse me. XVII There's ae wee faut they whyles lay to me, I like the lasses—Gude forgie me! For monie a plack they wheedle frae me At dance or fair; Maybe some ither thing they gie me, They weel can spare. XVIII But Mauchline Race or Mauchline Fair, I should be proud to meet you there: We'se gie ae night's discharge to care, If we forgather; And hae a swap o' rhymin-ware Wi' ane anither. XIX The four-gill chap, we'se gar him clatter, An' kirsen him wi' reekin water; Syne we'll sit down an' tak our whitter, To cheer our heart; An' faith, we'se be acquainted better Before we part. XX Awa ye selfish, warly race, Wha think that havins, sense, an' grace, Ev'n love an' friendship should give place To Catch-the-Plack! I dinna like to see your face, Nor hear your crack. XXI But ye whom social pleasure charms, Whose hearts the tide of kindness warms, Who hold your being on the terms, ‘Each aid the others,’ Come to my bowl, come to my arms, My friends, my brothers! XXII But, to conclude my lang epistle, As my auld pen's worn to the grissle, Twa lines frae you wad gar me fissle, Who am most fervent, While I can either sing or whistle, Your friend and servant. SECOND EPISTLE TO J. LAPRAIK APRIL 21, 1785 I While new-ca'd kye rowte at the stake An' pownies reek in pleugh or braik, This hour on e'enin's edge I take, To own I'm debtor To honest-hearted, auld Lapraik, For his kind letter. II Forjesket sair, with weary legs, Rattlin the corn out-owre the rigs, Or dealing thro' amang the naigs Their ten-hours' bite, My awkart Muse sair pleads and begs, I would na write. III The tapetless, ramfeezl'd hizzie, She's saft at best an' something lazy: Quo' she: ‘Ye ken we've been sae busy This month an' mair, That trowth, my head is grown right dizzie, An' something sair.’ IV Her dowff excuses pat me mad: ‘Conscience,’ says I, ‘ye thowless jad! I'll write, an' that a hearty blaud, This vera night; So dinna ye affront your trade, But rhyme it right. V ‘Shall bauld Lapraik, the king o' hearts, Tho' mankind were a pack o' cartes, Roose you sae weel for your deserts, In terms sae friendly; Yet ye'll neglect to shaw your parts An' thank him kindly?’ VI Sae I gat paper in a blink, An' down gaed stumpie in the ink: Quoth I: ‘Before I sleep a wink, I vow I'll close it: An' if ye winna mak it clink, By Jove, I'll prose it!’ VII Sae I've begun to scrawl, but whether In rhyme, or prose, or baith thegither, Or some hotch-potch that's rightly neither, Let time mak proof; But I shall scribble down some blether Just clean aff-loof. VIII My worthy friend, ne'er grudge an' carp, Tho' Fortune use you hard an' sharp; Come, kittle up your moorland harp Wi' gleesome touch! Ne'er mind how Fortune waft an' warp; She's but a bitch. IX She's gien me monie a jirt an' fleg, Sin' I could striddle owre a rig; But, by the Lord, tho' I should beg Wi' lyart pow, I'll laugh an' sing, an' shake my leg, As lang's I dow! X Now comes the sax-an-twentieth simmer I've seen the bud upo' the timmer, Still persecuted by the limmer Frae year to year; But yet, despite the kittle kimmer, I, Rob, am here. XI Do ye envý the city gent, Behint a kist to lie an' sklent; Or purse-proud, big wi' cent. per cent. An' muckle wame, In some bit brugh to represent A bailie's name? XII Or is't the paughty feudal thane, Wi' ruffl'd sark an' glancing cane, Wha thinks himsel nae sheep-shank bane, But lordly stalks; While caps an' bonnets aff are taen, As by he walks? XIII ‘O Thou wha gies us each guid gift! Gie me o' wit an' sense a lift, Then turn me, if Thou please, adrift Thro' Scotland wide; Wi' cits nor lairds I wadna shift, In a' their pride!’ XIV Were this the charter of our state, ‘On pain o' hell be rich an' great,’ Damnation then would be our fate, Beyond remead; But, thanks to heaven, that's no the gate We learn our creed. XV For thus the royal mandate ran, When first the human race began: ‘The social, friendly, honest man, Whate'er he be, 'Tis he fulfils great Nature's plan, And none but he.’ XVI O mandate glorious and divine! The followers o' the ragged Nine— Poor, thoughtless devils!—yet may shine In glorious light; While sordid sons o' Mammon's line Are dark as night! XVII Tho' here they scrape, an' squeeze, an' growl, Their worthless neivefu' of a soul May in some future carcase howl, The forest's fright; Or in some day-detesting owl May shun the light. XVIII Then may Lapraik and Burns arise, To reach their native, kindred skies, And sing their pleasures, hopes an' joys, In some mild sphere; Still closer knit in friendship's ties, Each passing year! TO WILLIAM SIMPSON OF OCHILTREE MAY 1785 I I gat your letter, winsome Willie; Wi' gratefu' heart I thank you brawlie; Tho' I maun say't, I wad be silly And unco vain, Should I believe, my coaxin billie, Your flatterin strain. II But I'se believe ye kindly meant it: I sud be laith to think ye hinted Ironic satire, sidelins sklented, On my poor Musie; Tho' in sic phraisin terms ye've penn'd it, I scarce excuse ye. III My senses wad be in a creel, Should I but dare a hope to speel, Wi' Allan, or wi' Gilbertfield, The braes o' fame; Or Fergusson, the writer-chiel, A deathless name. IV (O Fergusson! thy glorious parts Ill suited law's dry, musty arts! My curse upon your whunstane hearts, Ye E'nbrugh gentry! The tythe o' what ye waste at cartes Wad stow'd his pantry!) V Yet when a tale comes i' my head, Or lasses gie my heart a screed— As whyles they're like to be my dead, (O sad disease!) I kittle up my rustic reed; It gies me ease. VI Auld Coila, now, may fidge fu' fain, She's gotten bardies o' her ain; Chiels wha their chanters winna hain, But tune their lays, Till echoes a' resound again Her weel-sung praise. VII Nae Poet thought her worth his while, To set her name in measur'd style; She lay like some unkend-of isle Beside New Holland, Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil Besouth Magellan. VIII Ramsay an' famous Fergusson Gied Forth an' Tay a lift aboon; Yarrow an' Tweed, to monie a tune, Owre Scotland rings; While Irwin, Lugar, Ayr, an' Doon Naebody sings. IX Th' Illissus, Tiber, Thames, an' Seine, Glide sweet in monie a tunefu' line: But, Willie, set your fit to mine, An' cock your crest! We'll gar our streams and burnies shine Up wi' the best. X We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells, Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells, Her banks an' braes, her dens an' dells, Whare glorious Wallace Aft bure the gree, as story tells, Frae Suthron billies. XI At Wallace' name, what Scottish blood But boils up in a spring-tide flood? Oft have our fearless fathers strode By Wallace' side, Still pressing onward, red-wat-shod, Or glorious dy'd! XII O, sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods, When lintwhites chant amang the buds, And jinkin hares, in amorous whids, Their loves enjoy; While thro' the braes the cushat croods With wailfu' cry! XIII Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me, When winds rave thro' the naked tree; Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree Are hoary gray; Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee, Dark'ning the day! XIV O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms! Whether the summer kindly warms, Wi' life an' light; Or winter howls, in gusty storms, The lang, dark night! XV The Muse, nae poet ever fand her, Till by himsel he learn'd to wander, Adown some trottin burn's meander, An' no think lang: O, sweet to stray, an' pensive ponder A heart-felt sang! XVI The warly race may drudge an' drive, Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch, an' strive; Let me fair Nature's face descrive, And I, wi' pleasure, Shall let the busy, grumbling hive Bum owre their treasure. XVII Fareweel, my rhyme-composing brither! We've been owre lang unkend to ither: Now let us lay our heads thegither, In love fraternal: May Envy wallop in a tether, Black fiend, infernal! XVIII While Highlandmen hate tolls an' taxes; While moorlan' herds like guid, fat braxies; While Terra Firma, on her axis, Diurnal turns; Count on a friend, in faith an' practice, In Robert Burns. POSTSCRIPT XIX My memory's no worth a preen: I had amaist forgotten clean, Ye bade me write you what they mean By this New-Light, 'Bout which our herds sae aft hae been Maist like to fight. XX In days when mankind were but callans; At grammar, logic, an' sic talents, They took nae pains their speech to balance, Or rules to gie; But spak their thoughts in plain, braid Lallans, Like you or me. XXI In thae auld times, they thought the moon, Just like a sark, or pair o' shoon, Wore by degrees, till her last roon Gaed past their viewin; An' shortly after she was done, They gat a new ane. XXII This past for certain, undisputed; It ne'er cam i' their heads to doubt it, Till chiels gat up an' wad confute it, An' ca'd it wrang; An' muckle din there was about it, Baith loud an' lang. XXIII Some herds, weel learn'd upo' the Beuk, Wad threap auld folk the thing misteuk; For 'twas the auld moon turn'd a neuk An' out o' sight. An' backlins-comin to the leuk, She grew mair bright. XXIV This was deny'd, it was affirm'd; The herds and hissels were alarm'd; The rev'rend gray-beards rav'd an' storm'd, That beardless laddies Should think they better were inform'd Than their auld daddies. XXV Frae less to mair, it gaed to sticks; Frae words an' aiths, to clours an' nicks; An' monie a fallow gat his licks, Wi' hearty crunt; An' some, to learn them for their tricks, Were hang'd an' brunt. XXVI This game was play'd in monie lands, An' Auld-Light caddies bure sic hands, That faith, the youngsters took the sands Wi' nimble shanks Till lairds forbade, by strict commands, Sic bluidy pranks. XXVII But New-Light herds gat sic a cowe, Folk thought them ruin'd stick-an-stowe; Till now, amaist on ev'ry knowe Ye'll find ane placed; An' some, their New-Light fair avow, Just quite barefac'd. XXVIII Nae doubt the Auld-Light flocks are bleatin; Their zealous herds are vex'd and sweatin; Mysel, I've even seen them greetin Wi' girnin spite, To hear the moon sae sadly lie'd on By word an' write. XXIX But shortly they will cowe the louns! Some Auld-Light herds in neebor touns Are mind't, in things they ca' balloons, To tak a flight, An' stay ae month amang the moons An' see them right. XXX Guid observation they will gie them; An' when the auld moon's gaun to lea'e them, The hindmost shaird, they'll fetch it wi' them, Just i' their pouch; An' when the New-Light billies see them, I think they'll crouch! XXXI Sae, ye observe that a' this clatter Is naething but a ‘moonshine matter’; But tho' dull prose-folk Latin splatter In logic tulzie, I hope we, Bardies, ken some better Than mind sic brulzie. EPISTLE TO JOHN RANKINE ENCLOSING SOME POEMS I O rough, rude, ready-witted Rankine, The wale o' cocks for fun an' drinkin! There's monie godly folks are thinkin' Your dreams and tricks Will send you, Korah-like, a-sinkin Straught to Auld Nick's. II Ye hae sae monie cracks an' cants, And in your wicked drucken rants, Ye mak a devil o' the saunts, An' fill them fou'; And then their failings, flaws, an' wants Are a' seen thro'. III Hypocrisy, in mercy spare it! That holy robe, O, dinna tear it! Spare't for their sakes, wha aften wear it— The lads in black; But your curst wit, when it comes near it, Rives't aff their back. IV Think, wicked sinner, wha ye're skaithing: It's just the Blue-gown badge an' claithing O' saunts; tak that, ye lea'e them naething To ken them by Frae onie unregenerate heathen, Like you or I. V I've sent you here some rhyming ware A' that I bargain'd for, an' mair; Sae, when ye hae an hour to spare, I will expect, Yon sang ye'll sen't, wi' cannie care, And no neglect. VI Tho' faith, sma' heart hae I to sing: My Muse dow scarcely spread her wing! I've play'd mysel a bonie spring, An' danc'd my fill! I'd better gaen an' sair't the King At Bunker's Hill. VII 'Twas ae night lately, in my fun, I gaed a rovin wi' the gun, An' brought a paitrick to the grun'— A bonie hen; And, as the twilight was begun, Thought nane wad ken. VIII The poor, wee thing was little hurt; I straikit it a wee for sport, Ne'er thinkin they wad fash me for't; But, Deil-ma-care! Somebody tells the Poacher-Court The hale affair. IX Some auld, us'd hands had taen a note, That sic a hen had got a shot; I was suspected for the plot; I scorn'd to lie; So gat the whissle o' my groat, An' pay't the fee. X But, by my gun, o' guns the wale, An' by my pouther an' my hail. An' by my hen, an' by her tail, I vow an' swear! The game shall pay, owre moor an' dale, For this, niest year! XI As soon's the clockin-time is by, An' the wee pouts begun to cry, Lord, I'se hae sportin by an' by For my gowd guinea; Tho' I should herd the buckskin kye For't, in Virginia! XII Trowth, they had muckle for to blame! 'Twas neither broken wing nor limb, But twa-three chaps about the wame, Scarce thro' the feathers; An' baith a yellow George to claim An' thole their blethers! XIII It pits me ay as mad's a hare; So I can rhyme nor write nae mair; But pennyworths again is fair, When time's expedient: Meanwhile I am, respected Sir, Your most obedient. SONG [It was upon a Lammas night] Tune: Corn Rigs I It was upon a Lammas night, When corn rigs are bonie, Beneath the moon's unclouded light, I held awa to Annie; The time flew by, wi' tentless heed; Till, 'tween the late and early, Wi' sma' persuasion she agreed To see me thro' the barley. Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, An' corn rigs are bonie: I'll ne'er forget that happy night, Amang the rigs wi' Annie. II The sky was blue, the wind was still, The moon was shining clearly; I set her down, wi' right good will, Amang the rigs o' barley: I ken't her heart was a' my ain; I lov'd her most sincerely; I kiss'd her owre and owre again, Amang the rigs o' barley. III I lock'd her in my fond embrace; Her heart was beating rarely: My blessings on that happy place, Amang the rigs o' barley! But by the moon and stars so bright, That shone that hour so clearly! She ay shall bless that happy night Amang the rigs o' barley. IV I hae been blythe wi' comrades dear; I hae been merry drinking; I hae been joyfu' gath'rin gear; I hae been happy thinking: But a' the pleasures e'er I saw, Tho' three times doubl'd fairly— That happy night was worth them a', Amang the rigs o' barley. Corn rigs, an' barley rigs, An' corn rigs are bonie: I'll ne'er forget that happy night, Amang the rigs wi' Annie. SONG: COMPOSED IN AUGUST I Now westlin winds and slaught'ring guns Bring Autumn's pleasant weather; The gorcock springs on whirring wings Amang the blooming heather: Now waving grain, wide o'er the plain, Delights the weary farmer; The moon shines bright, as I rove by night To muse upon my charmer. II The paitrick lo'es the fruitfu' fells, The plover lo'es the mountains; The woodcock haunts the lonely dells, The soaring hern the fountains; Thro' lofty groves the cushat roves, The path o' man to shun it; The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush, The spreading thorn the linnet. III Thus ev'ry kind their pleasure find, The savage and the tender; Some social join, and leagues combine, Some solitary wander: Avaunt, away, the cruel sway! Tyrannic man's dominion! The sportsman's joy, the murd'ring cry, The flutt'ring, gory pinion! IV But, Peggy dear, the evening's clear, Thick flies the skimming swallow, The sky is blue, the fields in view All fading-green and yellow: Come let us stray our gladsome way, And view the charms of Nature; The rustling corn, the fruited thorn, And ilka happy creature. V We'll gently walk, and sweetly talk, While the silent moon shines clearly; I'll clasp thy waist, and, fondly prest, Swear how I lo'e thee dearly: Not vernal show'rs to budding flow'rs, Not Autumn to the farmer, So dear can be as thou to me, My fair, my lovely charmer! SONG: FROM THEE ELIZA Tune: Gilderoy I From thee Eliza, I must go, And from my native shore: The cruel fates between us throw A boundless ocean's roar; But boundless oceans, roaring wide Between my Love and me, They never, never can divide My heart and soul from thee. II Farewell, farewell, Eliza dear, The maid that I adore! A boding voice is in mine ear, We part to meet no more! But the latest throb that leaves my heart, While Death stands victor by, That throb, Eliza, is thy part, And thine that latest sigh! THE FAREWELL TO THE BRETHREN OF ST. JAMES'S LODGE, TARBOLTON Tune: Good-night, and joy be wi' you a'. I Adieu! a heart-warm, fond adieu; Dear Brothers of the Mystic Tie! Ye favour'd, ye enlighten'd few, Companions of my social joy! Tho' I to foreign lands must hie, Pursuing Fortune's slidd'ry ba'; With melting heart and brimful eye, I'll mind you still, tho' far awa. II Oft have I met your social band, And spent the cheerful, festive night; Oft, honour'd with supreme command, Presided o'er the Sons of Light; And by that Hieroglyphic bright, Which none but Craftsmen ever saw! Strong Mem'ry on my heart shall write Those happy scenes, when far awa. III May Freedom, Harmony, and Love, Unite you in the Grand Design, Beneath th'Omniscient Eye above— The glorious Architect Divine— That you may keep th'Unerring Line, Still rising by the Plummet's Law, Till Order bright completely shine, Shall be my pray'r, when far awa. IV And You farewell! whose merits claim Justly that Highest Badge to wear: Heav'n bless your honour'd, noble Name, To Masonry and Scotia dear! A last request permit me here, When yearly ye assemble a', One round, I ask it with a tear, To him, the Bard that's far awa. EPITAPH ON A HENPECKED SQUIRE As father Adam first was fool'd, A case that's still too common, Here lies a man a woman rul'd: The Devil ruled the woman. EPIGRAM ON SAID OCCASION O Death, had'st thou but spar'd his life, Whom we this day lament! We freely wad exchanged the wife, An' a' been weel content. Ev'n as he is, cauld in his graff, The swap we yet will do't; Tak thou the carlin's carcase aff, Thou'se get the saul o' boot. ANOTHER One Queen Artemisa, as old stories tell, When depriv'd of her husband she lovèd so well, In respect for the love and affection he'd show'd her, She reduc'd him to dust and she drank up the powder. But Queen Netherplace, of a diff'rent complexion, When call'd on to order the fun'ral direction, Would have eat her dead lord, on a slender pretence, Not to show her respect, but—to save the expense! EPITAPHS ON A CELEBRATED RULING ELDER Here Souter Hood in death does sleep: In hell, if he's gane thither, Satan, gie him thy gear to keep; He'll haud it weel thegither. ON A NOISY POLEMIC Below thir stanes lie Jamie's banes: O Death, it's my opinion, Thou ne'er took such a bleth'rin bitch Into thy dark dominion. ON WEE JOHNIE Hic jacet wee Johnie Whoe'er thou art, O reader, know, That Death has murder'd Johnie, An' here his body lies fu' low— For saul he ne'er had onie. FOR THE AUTHOR'S FATHER O ye whose cheek the tear of pity stains, Draw near with pious rev'rence, and attend! Here lie the loving husband's dear remains, The tender father, and the gen'rous friend. The pitying heart that felt for human woe, The dauntless heart that fear'd no human pride, The friend of man—to vice alone a foe; For ‘ev'n his failings lean'd to virtue's side.’ FOR ROBERT AIKEN, Esq. Know thou, O stranger to the fame Of this much lov'd, much honour'd name! (For none that knew him need be told), A warmer heart Death ne'er made cold FOR GAVIN HAMILTON, Esq. The poor man weeps—here Gavin sleeps, Whom canting wretches blam'd; But with such as he, where'er he be, May I be sav'd or damn'd. A BARD'S EPITAPH I Is there a whim-inspirèd fool, Owre fast for thought, owre hot for rule, Owre blate to seek, owre proud to snool?— Let him draw near; And owre this grassy heap sing dool, And drap a tear. II Is there a Bard of rustic song, Who, noteless, steals the crowds among, That weekly this aréa throng?— O, pass not by! But with a frater-feeling strong, Here, heave a sigh. III Is there a man, whose judgment clear Can others teach the course to steer, Yet runs, himself, life's mad career Wild as the wave?— Here pause—and, thro' the starting tear, Survey this grave. IV The poor inhabitant below Was quick to learn and wise to know, And keenly felt the friendly glow And softer flame; But thoughtless follies laid him low, And stain'd his name. V Reader, attend! whether thy soul Soars Fancy's flights beyond the pole, Or darkling grubs this earthly hole In low pursuit; Know, prudent, cautious, self-control Is wisdom's root. ADDED, EDINBURGH 1787 DEATH AND DOCTOR HORNBOOK A True Story I Some books are lies frae end to end, And some great lies were never penn'd: Ev'n ministers, they hae been kend, In holy rapture, A rousing whid at times to vend, And nail't wi' Scripture. II But this that I am gaun to tell, Which lately on a night befel, Is just as true's the Deil's in hell Or Dublin city: That e'er he nearer comes oursel 'S a muckle pity! III The clachan yill had made me canty, I was na fou, but just had plenty: I stacher'd whyles, but yet took tent ay To free the ditches; An' hillocks, stanes, an' bushes, kend ay Frae ghaists an' witches. IV The rising moon began to glowr The distant Cumnock Hills out-owre: To count her horns, wi' a' my pow'r I set mysel; But whether she had three or four, I cou'd na tell. V I was come round about the hill, And todlin down on Willie's mill, Setting my staff wi' a' my skill To keep me sicker; Tho' leeward whyles, against my will, I took a bicker. VI I there wi' Something does forgather, That pat me in an eerie swither; An awfu' scythe, out-owre ae shouther, Clear-dangling, hang; A three-tae'd leister on the ither Lay, large an' lang. VII Its stature seem'd lang Scotch ells twa; The queerest shape that e'er I saw, For fient a wame it had ava; And then its shanks, They were as thin, as sharp an' sma' As cheeks o' branks. VIII ‘Guid-een,’ quo' I; ‘Friend! hae ye been mawin, When ither folk are busy sawin?’ It seem'd to mak a kind o' stan', But naething spak. At length, says I: ‘Friend! whare ye gaun? Will ye go back?’ IX It spak right howe: ‘My name is Death, But be na' fley'd.’ Quoth I: ‘Guid faith, Ye're may be come to stap my breath; But tent me, billie: I red ye weel, take care o' skaith, See, there's a gully!’ X ‘Gudeman,’ quo' he, ‘put up your whittle, I'm no design'd to try its mettle; But if I did, I wad be kittle To be mislear'd: I wad na mind it, no that spittle Out-owre my beard.’ XI ‘Weel, weel!’ says I, ‘a bargain be't; Come, gie's your hand, an' say we're gree't; We'll ease our shanks, an' tak a seat: Come, gie's your news: This while ye hae been monie a gate, At monie a house.’ XII ‘Ay, ay!’ quo' he, an' shook his head, ‘It's e'en a lang, lang time indeed Sin' I began to nick the thread An' choke the breath: Folk maun do something for their bread, An' sae maun Death. XIII ‘Sax thousand years are near-hand fled Sin' I was to the butching bred, An' monie a scheme in vain's been laid To stap or scar me; Till ane Hornbook's ta'en up the trade, And faith! he'll waur me. XIV ‘Ye ken Jock Hornbook i' the clachan? Deil mak his king's-hood in a spleuchan!— He's grown sae weel acquaint wi' Buchan And ither chaps, The weans haud out their fingers laughin, An' pouk my hips. XV ‘See, here's a scythe, an' there's a dart, They hae pierc'd monie a gallant heart; But Doctor Hornbook wi' his art An' cursed skill, Has made them baith no worth a fart, Damn'd haet they'll kill! XVI ‘'Twas but yestreen, nae farther gane, I threw a noble throw at ane; Wi' less, I'm sure, I've hundreds slain; But Deil-ma-care! It just played dirl on the bane, But did nae mair. XVII ‘Hornbook was by wi' ready art, An' had sae fortify'd the part, That when I lookèd to my dart, It was sae blunt, Fient haet o't wad hae pierc'd the heart Of a kail-runt. XVIII ‘I drew my scythe in sic a fury, I near-hand cowpit wi' my hurry, But yet the bauld Apothecary Withstood the shock: I might as weel hae try'd a quarry O' hard whin-rock. XIX ‘Ev'n them he canna get attended, Altho' their face he ne'er had kend it, Just shit in a kail-blade an' send it, As soon's he smells't, Baith their disease and what will mend it, At once he tells't. XX ‘And then a' doctor's saws and whittles Of a' dimensions, shapes, an' mettles, A' kinds o' boxes, mugs, and bottles, He's sure to hae; Their Latin names as fast he rattles As A B C. XXI ‘Calces o' fossils, earth, and trees; True sal-marinum o' the seas; The farina of beans an' pease, He has't in plenty; Aqua-fontis, what you please, He can content ye. XXII ‘Forbye some new, uncommon weapons, Urinus spiritus of capons; Or mite-horn shavings, filings, scrapings, Distill'd per se; Sal-alkali o' midge-tail-clippings, And monie mae.’ XXIII ‘Waes me for Johnie Ged's Hole now,’ Quoth I, ‘if that thae news be true! His braw calf-ward whare gowans grew Sae white and bonie, Nae doubt they'll rive it wi' the plew: They'll ruin Johnie!’ XXIV The creature grain'd an eldritch laugh, And says: ‘Ye nedna yoke the pleugh, Kirkyards will soon be till'd eneugh, Tak ye nae fear: They'll a' be trench'd wi monie a sheugh In twa-three year. XXV ‘Whare I kill'd ane, a fair strae death By loss o' blood or want o' breath, This night I'm free to tak my aith, That Hornbook's skill Has clad a score i' their last claith By drap an' pill. XXVI ‘An honest wabster to his trade, Whase wife's twa nieves were scarce weel-bred, Gat tippence-worth to mend her head, When it was sair; The wife slade cannie to her bed, But ne'er spak mair. XXVII ‘A countra laird had taen the batts, Or some curmurring in his guts, His only son for Hornbook sets, An' pays him well: The lad, for twa guid gimmer-pets, Was laird himsel. XXVIII ‘A bonie lass—ye kend her name— Some ill-brewn drink had hov'd her wame; She trusts hersel, to hide the shame, In Hornbook's care; Horn sent her aff to her lang hame To hide it there. XXIX ‘That's just a swatch o' Hornbook's way; Thus goes he on from day to day, Thus does he poison, kill, an' slay, An's weel paid for't; Yet stops me o' my lawfu' prey Wi' his damn'd dirt: XXX ‘But, hark! I'll tell you of a plot, Tho' dinna ye be speakin o't: I'll nail the self-conceited sot, As dead's a herrin; Niest time we meet, I'll wad a groat, He gets his fairin!’ XXXI But just as he began to tell, The auld kirk-hammer strak the bell Some wee short hour ayont the twal, Which raised us baith: I took the way that pleas'd mysel, And sae did Death. THE BRIGS OF AYR A Poem INSCRIBED TO JOHN BALLANTINE, ESQ., AYR The simple Bard, rough at the rustic plough, Learning his tuneful trade from ev'ry bough (The chanting linnet, or the mellow thrush, Hailing the setting sun, sweet, in the green thorn bush; The soaring lark, the perching red-breast shrill, Or deep-ton'd plovers grey, wild-whistling o'er the hill): Shall he—nurst in the peasant's lowly shed, To hardy independence bravely bred, By early poverty to hardship steel'd, And train'd to arms in stern misfortune's field— Shall he be guilty of their hireling crimes, The servile, mercenary Swiss of rhymes? Or labour hard the panegyric close, With all the venal soul of dedicating prose? No! though his artless strains he rudely sings, And throws his hand uncouthly o'er the strings, He glows with all the spirit of the bard, Fame, honest fame, his great, his dear reward. Still, if some patron's gen'rous care he trace, Skill'd in the secret to bestow with grace; When Ballantine befriends his humble name, And hands the rustic stranger up to fame, With heartfelt throes his grateful bosom swells: The godlike bliss, to give, alone excels. 'Twas when the stacks get on their winter hap, And thack and rape secure the toil-won crap; Potatoe-bings are snuggèd up frae skaith O' coming winter's biting, frosty breath; The bees, rejoicing o'er their summer toils— Unnumber'd buds' an' flowers' delicious spoils, Seal'd up with frugal care in massive waxen piles— Are doom'd by man, that tyrant o'er the weak, The death o' devils smoor'd wi' brimstone reek: The thundering guns are heard on ev'ry side, The wounded coveys, reeling, scatter wide; The feather'd field-mates, bound by Nature's tie, Sires, mothers, children, in one carnage lie: (What warm, poetic heart but inly bleeds, And execrates man's savage, ruthless deeds!) Nae mair the flower in field or meadow springs; Nae mair the grove with airy concert rings, Except perhaps the robin's whistling glee, Proud o' the height o' some bit half-lang tree; The hoary morns precede the sunny days; Mild, calm, serene, widespreads the noontide blaze, While thick the gossamour waves wanton in the rays. 'Twas in that season, when a simple Bard, Unknown and poor—simplicity's reward!— Ae night, within the ancient brugh of Ayr, By whim inspir'd, or haply prest wi' care, He left his bed, and took his wayward route, And down by Simpson's wheel'd the left about (Whether impell'd by all-directing Fate, To witness what I after shall narrate; Or whether, rapt in meditation high, He wander'd forth, he knew not where nor why): The drowsy Dungeon-Clock had number'd two, And Wallace Tower had sworn the fact was true; The tide-swoln Firth, with sullen-sounding roar, Through the still night dash'd hoarse along the shore; All else was hush'd as Nature's closèd e'e; The silent moon shone high o'er tower and tree; The chilly frost, beneath the silver beam, Crept, gently-crusting, o'er the glittering stream. When, lo! on either hand the list'ning Bard, The clanging sugh of whistling wings is heard; Two dusky forms dart thro' the midnight air, Swift as the gos drives on the wheeling hare; Ane on th'Auld Brig his airy shape uprears, The ither flutters o'er the rising piers: Our warlock rhymer instantly descried The Sprites that owre the Brigs of Ayr preside. (That bards are second-sighted is nae joke, And ken the lingo of the sp'ritual folk; Fays, spunkies, kelpies, a', they can explain them, And ev'n the vera deils they brawly ken them). Auld Brig appear'd of ancient Pictish race, The vera wrinkles Gothic in his face; He seem'd as he wi' Time had warstl'd lang, Yet, teughly doure, he bade an unco bang. New Brig was buskit in a braw new coat, That he, at Lon'on, frae ane Adams got; In's hand five taper staves as smooth's a bead, Wi' virls an' whirlygigums at the head. The Goth was stalking round with anxious search, Spying the time-worn flaws in ev'ry arch. It chanc'd his new-come neebor took his e'e, And e'en a vex'd and angry heart had he! Wi' thieveless sneer to see his modish mien, He, down the water, gies him this guid-een:— AULD BRIG ‘I doubt na, frien', ye'll think ye're nae sheep shank, Ance ye were streekit owre frae bank to bank! But gin ye be a brig as auld as me— Tho' faith, that date, I doubt, ye'll never see— There'll be, if that day come, I'll wad a boddle, Some fewer whigmeleeries in your noddle.’ NEW BRIG ‘Auld Vandal! ye but show your little mense, Just much about it wi' your scanty sense: Will your poor, narrow foot-path of a street, Where twa wheel-barrows tremble when they meet, Your ruin'd, formless bulk o' stane an' lime, Compare wi' bonie brigs o' modern time? There's men of taste would tak the Ducat stream, Tho' they should cast the vera sark and swim, E'er they would grate their feelings wi' the view O' sic an ugly, Gothic hulk as you.’ AULD BRIG ‘Conceited gowk! puff'd up wi' windy pride! This monie a year I've stood the flood an' tide; And tho' wi' crazy eild I'm sair forfairn, I'll be a brig when ye're a shapeless cairn! As yet ye little ken about the matter, But twa-three winters will inform ye better. When heavy, dark, continued, a'-day rains Wi' deepening deluges o'erflow the plains; When from the hills where springs the brawling Coil, Or stately Lugar's mossy fountains boil, Or where the Greenock winds his moorland course, Or haunted Garpal draws his feeble source, Arous'd by blustering winds an' spotting thowes, In monie a torrent down the snaw-broo rowes; While crashing ice, borne on the roaring speat, Sweeps dams, an' mills, an' brigs, a' to the gate; And from Glenbuck down to the Ratton-Key Auld Ayr is just one lengthen'd, tumbling sea— Then down ye'll hurl (deil nor ye never rise!), And dash the gumlie jaups up to the pouring skies! A lesson sadly teaching, to your cost, That Architecture's noble art is lost!’ NEW BRIG ‘Fine architecture, trowth, I needs must say't o't, The Lord be thankit that we've tint the gate o't! Gaunt, ghastly, ghaist-alluring edifices, Hanging with threat'ning jut, like precipices; O'er-arching, mouldy, gloom-inspiring coves, Supporting roofs fantastic—stony groves; Windows and doors in nameless sculptures drest, With order, symmetry, or taste unblest; Forms like some bedlam statuary's dream, The craz'd creations of misguided whim; Forms might be worshipp'd on the bended knee, And still the second dread Command be free: Their likeness is not found on earth, in air, or sea! Mansions that would disgrace the building taste Of any mason reptile, bird or beast, Fit only for a doited monkish race, Or frosty maids forsworn the dear embrace, Or cuifs of later times, wha held the notion, That sullen gloom was sterling true devotion: Fancies that our guid brugh denies protection, And soon may they expire, unblest with resurrection!’ AULD BRIG ‘O ye, my dear-remember'd, ancient yealings, Were ye but here to share my wounded feelings! Ye worthy proveses, an' monie a bailie, Wha in the paths o' righteousness did toil ay; Ye dainty deacons, an' ye douce conveeners, To whom our moderns are but causey-cleaners; Ye godly councils, wha hae blest this town; Ye godly brethren o' the sacred gown, Wha meekly gie your hurdies to the smiters; And (what would now be strange), ye godly Writers; A' ye douce folk I've borne aboon the broo, Were ye but here, what would ye say or do! How would your spirits groan in deep vexation To see each melancholy alteration; And, agonising, curse the time and place When ye begat the base degen'rate race! Nae langer rev'rend men, their country's glory, In plain braid Scots hold forth a plain, braid story; Nae langer thrifty citizens, an' douce, Meet owre a pint or in the council-house: But staumrel, corky-headed, graceless gentry, The herryment and ruin of the country; Men three-parts made by tailors and by barbers, Wha waste your weel-hain'd gear on damn'd New Brigs and harbours!’ NEW BRIG ‘Now haud you there! for faith ye've said enough, And muckle mair than ye can mak to through. As for your priesthood, I shall say but little, Corbies and clergy are a shot right kittle: But, under favour o' your langer beard, Abuse o' magistrates might weel be spar'd; To liken them to your auld-warld squad, I must needs say, comparisons are odd. In Ayr, wag-wits nae mair can hae a handle To mouth ‘a Citizen,’ a term o' scandal; Nae mair the council waddles down the street, In all the pomp of ignorant conceit; Men wha grew wise priggin owre hops an' raisins, Or gather'd lib'ral views in bonds and seisins; If haply Knowledge, on a random tramp, Had shor'd them with a glimmer of his lamp, And would to common-sense for once betray'd them, Plain, dull stupidity stept kindly in to aid them.’ What farther clish-ma-claver might been said, What bloody wars, if Sprites had blood to shed, No man can tell; but, all before their sight, A fairy train appear'd in order bright: Adown the glittering stream they featly danc'd; Bright to the moon their various dresses glanc'd; They footed o'er the wat'ry glass so neat, The infant ice scarce bent beneath their feet; While arts of minstrelsy among them rung, And soul-ennobling Bards heroic ditties sung. O, had M'Lauchlan, thairm-inspiring sage, Been there to hear this heavenly band engage, When thro' his dear strathspeys they bore with Highland rage; Or when they struck old Scotia's melting airs, The lover's raptured joys or bleeding cares; How would his Highland lug been nobler fir'd, And ev'n his matchless hand with finer touch inspir'd! No guess could tell what instrument appear'd, But all the soul of Music's self was heard; Harmonious concert rung in every part, While simple melody pour'd moving on the heart. The Genius of the Stream in front appears, A venerable chief advanc'd in years; His hoary head with water-lilies crown'd, His manly leg with garter-tangle bound. Next came the loveliest pair in all the ring, Sweet Female Beauty hand in hand with Spring; Then, crown'd with flow'ry hay, came Rural Joy, And Summer, with his fervid-beaming eye; All-cheering Plenty, with her flowing horn, Led yellow Autumn wreath'd with nodding corn; Then Winter's time-bleach'd locks did hoary show, By Hospitality, with cloudless brow. Next follow'd Courage, with his martial stride, From where the Feal wild-woody coverts hide; Benevolence, with mild, benignant air, A female form, came from the towers of Stair; Learning and Worth in equal measures trode From simple Catrine, their long-lov'd abode; Last, white-rob'd Peace, crown'd with a hazel wreath, To rustic Agriculture did bequeath The broken, iron instruments of death: At sight of whom our Sprites forgat their kindling wrath. THE ORDINATION For sense, they little owe to frugal Heav'n: To please the mob they hide the little giv'n. I Kilmarnock wabsters, fidge an' claw, An' pour your creeshie nations; An' ye wha leather rax an' draw, Of a' denominations; Swith! to the Laigh Kirk, ane an' a', An' there tak up your stations; Then aff to Begbie's in a raw, An' pour divine libations For joy this day. II Curst Common-sense, that imp o' hell, Cam in wi' Maggie Lauder: But Oliphant aft made her yell, An' Russell sair misca'd her: This day Mackinlay taks the flail, An' he's the boy will blaud her! He'll clap a shangan on her tail, An' set the bairns to daud her Wi' dirt this day. III Mak haste an' turn King David owre, An' lilt wi' holy clangor; O' double verse come gie us four, An' skirl up the Bangor: This day the Kirk kicks up a stoure: Nae mair the knaves shall wrang her, For Heresy is in her pow'r, And gloriously she'll whang her Wi' pith this day. IV Come, let a proper text be read, An' touch it aff wi' vigour, How graceless Ham leugh at his dad, Which made Canàan a nigger; Or Phineas drove the murdering blade Wi' whore-abhorring rigour; Or Zipporah, the scauldin jad, Was like a bluidy tiger I' th'inn that day. V There, try his mettle on the Creed, And bind him down wi' caution,— That stipend is a carnal weed He taks but for the fashion— And gie him o'er the flock to feed, And punish each transgression; Especial, rams that cross the breed, Gie them sufficient threshin: Spare them nae day. VI Now auld Kilmarnock, cock thy tail, An' toss thy horns fu' canty; Nae mair thou'lt rowte out-owre the dale, Because thy pasture's scanty; For lapfu's large o' gospel kail Shall fill thy crib in plenty, An' runts o' grace, the pick an' wale, No gien by way o' dainty, But ilka day. VII Nae mair by Babel's streams we'll weep To think upon our Zion; And hing our fiddles up to sleep, Like baby-clouts a-dryin Come, screw the pegs wi' tunefu' cheep, And o'er the thairms be tryin; O, rare! to see our elbucks wheep, And a' like lamb-tails flyin Fu' fast this day! VIII Lang, Patronage, wi' rod o' airn, Has shor'd the Kirk's undoin; As lately Fenwick, sair forfairn, Has proven to its ruin: Our patron, honest man! Glencairn, He saw mischief was brewin; An' like a godly, elect bairn, He's waled us out a true ane, And sound this day. IX Now Robertson harangue nae mair, But steek your gab for ever; Or try the wicked town of Ayr, For there they'll think you clever; Or, nae reflection on your lear, Ye may commence a shaver; Or to the Netherton repair, An' turn a carpet-weaver Aff-hand this day. X Mu'trie and you were just a match, We never had sic twa drones: Auld Hornie did the Laigh Kirk watch, Just like a winkin baudrons, And ay he catch'd the tither wretch, To fry them in his caudrons; But now his Honor maun detach, Wi' a' his brimstone squadrons, Fast, fast this day. XI See, see auld Orthodoxy's faes She's swingein thro' the city! Hark, how the nine-tail'd cat she plays! I vow it's unco pretty: There, Learning, with his Greekish face, Grunts out some Latin ditty; And Common-Sense is gaun, she says, To mak to Jamie Beattie Her plaint this day. XII But there's Morality himsel, Embracing all opinions; Hear, how he gies the tither yell Between his twa companions! See, how she peels the skin an' fell, As ane were peelin onions! Now there, they're packèd aff to hell, An' banish'd our dominions, Henceforth this day. XIII O happy day! rejoice, rejoice! Come bouse about the porter! Morality's demure decoys Shall here nae mair find quarter: Mackinlay, Russell, are the boys That Heresy can torture; They'll gie her on a rape a hoyse, And cowe her measure shorter By th'head some day. XIV Come, bring the tither mutchkin in, And here's—for a conclusion— To ev'ry New Light mother's son, From this time forth, confusion! If mair they deave us wi' their din Or patronage intrusion, We'll light a spunk, and ev'ry skin We'll run them aff in fusion, Like oil some day. THE CALF To the Rev. James Steven, on his text, Malachi iv. 2:— ‘And ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.’ I Right, sir! your text I'll prove it true, Tho' heretics may laugh; For instance, there's yoursel just now, God knows, an unco calf. II And should some patron be so kind As bless you wi' a kirk, I doubt na, sir, but then we'll find You're still as great a stirk. III But, if the lover's raptur'd hour Shall ever be your lot, Forbid it, every heavenly Power, You e'er should be a stot! IV Tho', when some kind connubial dear Your but-an'-ben adorns, The like has been that you may wear A noble head of horns. V And, in your lug, most reverend James, To hear you roar and rowte, Few men o' sense will doubt your claims To rank among the nowte. VI And when ye're number'd wi' the dead Below a grassy hillock, With justice they may mark your head:— ‘Here lies a famous bullock!’ ADDRESS TO THE UNCO GUID OR THE RIGIDLY RIGHTEOUS My Son, these maxims make a rule, An' lump them ay thegither: The Rigid Righteous is a fool, The Rigid Wise anither; The cleanest corn that e'er was dight May hae some pyles o' caff in; So ne'er a fellow-creature slight For random fits o' daffin. SOLOMON (Eccles. vii. 16). I O ye, wha are sae guid yoursel, Sae pious and sae holy, Ye've nought to do but mark and tell Your neebours' fauts and folly; Whase life is like a weel-gaun mill, Supplied wi' store o' water; The heapet happer's ebbing still, An' still the clap plays clatter! II Hear me, ye venerable core, As counsel for poor mortals That frequent pass douce Wisdom's door For glaikit Folly's portals: I for their thoughtless, careless sakes Would here propone defences— Their donsie tricks, their black mistakes, Their failings and mischances. III Ye see your state wi' theirs compared, And shudder at the niffer; But cast a moment's fair regard, What makes the mighty differ? Discount what scant occasion gave; That purity ye pride in; And (what's aft mair than a' the lave) Your better art o' hidin. IV Think, when your castigated pulse Gies now and then a wallop, What ragings must his veins convulse, That still eternal gallop! Wi' wind and tide fair i' your tail, Right on ye scud your sea-way; But in the teeth o' baith to sail, It maks an unco lee-way. V See Social-life and Glee sit down All joyous and unthinking, Till, quite transmugrify'd, they're grown Debauchery and Drinking: O, would they stay to calculate, Th' eternal consequences, Or—your more dreaded hell to state— Damnation of expenses! VI Ye high, exalted, virtuous dames, Tied up in godly laces, Before ye gie poor Frailty names, Suppose a change o' cases: A dear-lov'd lad, convenience snug, A treach'rous inclination— But, let me whisper i' your lug, Ye're aiblins nae temptation. VII Then gently scan your brother man, Still gentler sister woman; Tho' they may gang a kennin wrang, To step aside is human: One point must still be greatly dark, The moving why they do it; And just as lamely can ye mark How far perhaps they rue it. VIII Who made the heart, 'tis He alone Decidedly can try us: He knows each chord, its various tone, Each spring, its various bias: Then at the balance let's be mute, We never can adjust it; What's done we partly may compute, But know not what's resisted. TAM SAMSON'S ELEGY An honest man's the noblest work of God. POPE. I Has auld Kilmarnock seen the Deil? Or great Mackinlay thrawn his heel? Or Robertson again grown weel To preach an' read? ‘Na, waur than a'!’ cries ilka chiel, ‘Tam Samson's dead!’ II Kilmarnock lang may grunt an' grane, An' sigh, an' sab, an' greet her lane, An' cleed her bairns—man, wife an' wean— In mourning weed; To Death she's dearly pay'd the kain: Tam Samson's dead! III The Brethren o' the mystic level May hing their head in woefu' bevel, While by their nose the tears will revel, Like onie bead; Death's gien the Lodge an unco devel: Tam Samson's dead! IV When Winter muffles up his cloak, And binds the mire like a rock; When to the loughs the curlers flock, Wi' gleesome speed, Wha will they station at the cock?— Tam Samson's dead! V He was the king of a' the core, To guard, or draw, or wick a bore, Or up the rink like Jehu roar In time o' need; But now he lags on Death's hog-score: Tam Samson's dead! VI Now safe the stately sawmont sail, And trouts bedropp'd wi' crimson hail, And eels, weel-kend for souple tail, And geds for greed, Since, dark in Death's fish-creel, we wail Tam Samson dead! VII Rejoice, ye birring paitricks a'; Ye cootie moorcocks, crousely craw; Ye maukins, cock your fud fu' braw Withouten dread; Your mortal fae is now awa: Tam Samson's dead! VIII That woefu' morn be ever mourn'd, Saw him in shootin graith adorn'd, While pointers round impatient burn'd, Frae couples free'd; But och! he gaed and ne'er return'd: Tam Samson's dead. IX In vain auld-age his body batters, In vain the gout his ancles fetters, In vain the burns cam down like waters, An acre braid! Now ev'ry auld wife, greetin, clatters: ‘Tam Samson's dead!’ X Owre monie a weary hag he limpit, An' ay the tither shot he thumpit, Till coward Death behint him jumpit, Wi' deadly feide; Now he proclaims wi' tout o' trumpet: ‘Tam Samson's dead!“ XI When at his heart he felt the dagger, He reel'd his wonted bottle-swagger, But yet he drew the mortal trigger Wi' weel-aim'd heed; ‘Lord, five!’ he cry'd, an' owre did stagger— Tam Samson's dead! XII Ilk hoary hunter mourn'd a brither; Ilk sportsman-youth bemoan'd a father; Yon auld gray stane, amang the heather, Marks out his head; Whare Burns has wrote, in rhyming blether: ‘Tam Samson's dead!’ XIII There low he lies in lasting rest; Perhaps upon his mould'ring breast Some spitefu' moorfowl bigs her nest, To hatch an' breed: Alas! nae mair he'll them molest: Tam Samson's dead! XIV When August winds the heather wave, And sportsmen wander by yon grave, Three volleys let his memory crave O' pouther an' lead, Till Echo answers frae her cave: ‘Tam Samson's dead!’ XV ‘Heav'n rest his saul whare'er he be!’ Is th'wish o' monie mae than me: He had twa fauts, or maybe three, Yet what remead? Ae social, honest man want we: Tam Samson's dead! THE EPITAPH Tam Samson's weel-worn clay here lies: Ye canting zealots, spare him! If honest worth in Heaven rise, Ye'll mend or ye win near him. PER CONTRA Go, Fame, an' canter like a filly Thro' a' the streets an neuks o' Killie; Tell ev'ry social honest billie To cease his grievin; For, yet unskaith'd by Death's gleg gullie, Tam Samson's leevin! A WINTER NIGHT Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, That bide the pelting of this pityless storm! How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you From seasons such as these? SHAKESPEARE. I When biting Boreas, fell and doure, Sharp shivers thro' the leafless bow'r; When Phœbus gies a short-liv'd glow'r, Far south the lift, Dim-dark'ning thro' the flaky show'r Or whirling drift: II Ae night the storm the steeples rocked; Poor Labour sweet in sleep was locked; While burns, wi' snawy wreaths up-choked, Wild-eddying swirl, Or, thro' the mining outlet bocked, Down headlong hurl: III List'ning the doors an' winnocks rattle, I thought me on the ourie cattle, Or silly sheep, wha bide this brattle O' winter war, And thro the drift, deep-lairing, sprattle Beneath a scaur. IV Ilk happing bird—wee, helpless thing! That in the merry months o' spring Delighted me to hear thee sing, What comes o' thee? Whare wilt thou cow'r thy chittering wing, An' close thy e'e? V Ev'n you, on murd'ring errands toil'd, Lone from your savage homes exil'd, The blood-stain'd roost and sheep-cote spoil'd My heart forgets, While pityless the tempest wild Sore on you beats! VI Now Phœbe, in her midnight reign, Dark-muffl'd, view'd the dreary plain; Still crowding thoughts, a pensive train, Rose in my soul, When on my ear this plaintive strain, Slow-solemn, stole:— VII ‘Blow, blow, ye winds, with heavier gust! And freeze, thou bitter-biting frost! Descend, ye chilly, smothering snows! Not all your rage, as now united, shows More hard unkindness unrelenting, Vengeful malice, unrepenting, Than heaven-illumin'd Man on brother Man bestows! See stern Oppression's iron grip, Or mad Ambition's gory hand, Sending, like blood-hounds from the slip, Woe, Want, and Murder o'er a land! Ev'n in the peaceful rural vale, Truth, weeping tells the mournful tale: How pamper'd Luxury, Flatt'ry by her side, The parasite empoisoning her ear, With all the servile wretches in the rear, Looks o'er proud Property, extended wide; And eyes the simple, rustic hind, Whose toil upholds the glitt'ring show— A creature of another kind, Some coarser substance, unrefin'd— Plac'd for her lordly use, thus far, thus vile, below! Where, where is Love's fond, tender throe, With lordly Honor's lofty brow, The pow'rs you proudly own? Is there, beneath Love's noble name, Can harbour, dark, the selfish aim, To bless himself alone? Mark Maiden-Innocence a prey To love-pretending snares: This boasted Honor turns away, Shunning soft Pity's rising sway, Regardless of the tears and unavailing pray'rs! Perhaps this hour, in Misery's squalid nest, She strains your infant to her joyless breast, And with a mother's fears shrinks at the rocking blast! VIII ’O ye! who, sunk in beds of down, Feel not a want but what yourselves create, Think, for a moment, on his wretched fate, Whom friends and fortune quite disown! Ill-satisfy'd keen nature's clam'rous call, Stretch'd on his straw, he lays himself to sleep; While through the ragged roof and chinky wall, Chill, o'er his slumbers piles the drifty heap! Think on the dungeon's grim confine, Where Guilt and poor Misfortune pine! Guilt, erring man, relenting view! But shall thy legal rage pursue The wretch, already crushèd low By cruel Fortune's undeservèd blow? Affliction's sons are brothers in distress; A brother to relieve, how exquisite the bliss!’ IX I heard nae mair, for Chanticleer Shook off the pouthery snaw, And hail'd the morning with a cheer, A cottage-rousing craw. But deep this truth impress'd my mind: Thro' all His works abroad, The heart benevolent and kind The most resembles God. STANZAS WRITTEN IN PROSPECT OF DEATH I Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene? Have I so found it full of pleasing charms? Some drops of joy with draughts of ill between; Some gleams of sunshine mid renewing storms. Is it departing pangs my soul alarms? Or death's unlovely, dreary, dark abode? For guilt, for guilt, my terrors are in arms: I tremble to approach an angry God, And justly smart beneath his sin-avenging rod. II Fain would I say: ‘Forgive my foul offence,’ Fain promise never more to disobey. But should my Author health again dispense, Again I might desert fair virtue's way; Again in folly's path might go astray; Again exalt the brute and sink the man: Then how should I for heavenly mercy pray, Who act so counter heavenly mercy's plan? Who sin so oft have mourn'd, yet to temptation ran? III O Thou great Governor of all below!— If I may dare a lifted eye to Thee,— Thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow, Or still the tumult of the raging sea: With that controlling pow'r assist ev'n me Those headlong furious passions to confine, For all unfit I feel my pow'rs to be To rule their torrent in th'allowèd line: O, aid me with Thy help, Omnipotence Divine! PRAYER: O THOU DREAD POWER Lying at a reverend friend's house one night the author left the following verses in the room where he slept. I O Thou dread Power, who reign'st above, I know thou wilt me hear, When for this scene of peace and love I make my prayer sincere. II The hoary Sire—the mortal stroke, Long, long be pleas'd to spare: To bless his little filial flock, And show what good men are. III She, who her lovely offspring eyes With tender hopes and fears— O, bless her with a mother's joys, But spare a mother's tears! IV Their hope, their stay, their darling youth, In manhood's dawning blush, Bless him, Thou God of love and truth. Up to a parent's wish. V The beauteous, seraph sister-band— With earnest tears I pray— Thou know'st the snares on every hand, Guide Thou their steps alway. VI When, soon or late, they reach that coast, O'er Life's rough ocean driven, May they rejoice, no wand'rer lost, A family in Heaven! PARAPHRASE OF THE FIRST PSALM I The man, in life wherever plac'd, Hath happiness in store, Who walks not in the wicked's way Nor learns their guilty lore; II Nor from the seat of scornful pride Casts forth his eyes abroad, But with humility and awe Still walks before his God! III That man shall flourish like the trees, Which by the streamlets grow: The fruitful top is spread on high, And firm the root below. IV But he, whose blossom buds in guilt, Shall to the ground be cast, And, like the rootless stubble, tost Before the sweeping blast. V For why? that God the good adore Hath giv'n them peace and rest, But hath decreed that wicked men Shall ne'er be truly blest. PRAYER UNDER THE PRESSURE OF VIOLENT ANGUISH I O Thou Great Being! what Thou art Surpasses me to know; Yet sure I am, that known to Thee Are all Thy works below. II Thy creature here before Thee stands, All wretched and distrest; Yet sure those ills that wring my soul Obey Thy high behest. III Sure Thou, Almighty, canst not act From cruelty or wrath! O, free my weary eyes from tears, Or close them fast in death! IV But, if I must afflicted be To suit some wise design, Then man my soul with firm resolves To bear and not repine! THE NINETIETH PSALM VERSIFIED I O Thou, the first, the greatest friend Of all the human race! Whose strong right hand has ever been Their stay and dwelling place! II Before the mountains heav'd their heads Beneath Thy forming hand, Before this ponderous globe itself Arose at Thy command: III That Power, which rais'd and still upholds This universal frame, From countless, unbeginning time Was ever still the same. IV Those mighty periods of years, Which seem to us so vast, Appear no more before Thy sight Than yesterday that's past. V Thou giv'st the word: Thy creature, man, Is to existence brought; Again Thou say'st: ‘Ye sons of men, Return ye into nought!’ VI Thou layest them, with all their cares, In everlasting sleep; As with a flood Thou tak'st them off With overwhelming sweep. VII They flourish like the morning flower In beauty's pride array'd, But long ere night, cut down, it lies All wither'd and decay'd. TO MISS LOGAN WITH BEATTIE'S POEMS FOR A NEW YEAR'S GIFT JANUARY 1, 1787 I Again the silent wheels of time Their annual round have driv'n, And you, tho' scarce in maiden prime, Are so much nearer Heav'n. II No gifts have I from Indian coasts The infant year to hail; I send you more than India boasts In Edwin's simple tale. III Our sex with guile, and faithless love, Is charg'd—perhaps too true; But may, dear maid, each lover prove An Edwin still to you. ADDRESS TO A HAGGIS I Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o' the puddin-race! Aboon them a' ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm: Weel are ye wordy of a grace As lang's my arm. II The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time o' need, While thro' your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. III His knife see rustic Labour dight, An' cut ye up wi' ready slight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like onie ditch; And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! IV Then, horn for horn, they stretch an' strive: Deil tak the hindmost, on they drive, Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve Are bent like drums; Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, ‘Bethankit!’ hums. V Is there that owre his French ragout, Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad mak her spew Wi' perfect sconner, Looks down wi' sneering, scornfu' view On sic a dinner? VI Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as a wither'd rash, His spindle shank a guid whip-lash, His nieve a nit; Thro' bluidy flood or field to dash, O how unfit! VII But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread, Clap in his walie nieve a blade, He'll make it whissle; An' legs, an' arms, an' heads will sned Like taps o' thrissle. VIII Ye Pow'rs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o' fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware, That jaups in luggies; But, if ye wish her gratefu' prayer, Gie her a Haggis! ADDRESS TO EDINBURGH I Edina! Scotia's darling seat All hail thy palaces and tow'rs, Where once, beneath a Monarch's feet, Sat Legislation's sov'reign pow'rs: From marking wildly-scatt'red flow'rs, As on the banks of Ayr I stray'd, And singing, lone, the ling'ring hours, I shelter in thy honor'd shade. II Here Wealth still swells the golden tide, As busy Trade his labours plies; There Architecture's noble pride Bids elegance and splendour rise: Here Justice, from her native skies, High wields her balance and her rod; There Learning, with his eagle eyes, Seeks Science in her coy abode. III Thy sons, Edina, social, kind, With open arms the stranger hail; Their views enlarg'd, their lib'ral mind, Above the narrow, rural vale; Attentive still to Sorrow's wail, Or modest Merit's silent claim: And never may their sources fail! And never Envy blot their name! IV Thy daughters bright thy walks adorn, Gay as the gilded summer sky, Sweet as the dewy, milk-white thorn. Dear as the raptur'd thrill of joy! Fair Burnet strikes th'adoring eye, Heav'n's beauties on my fancy shine: I see the Sire of Love on high, And own His work indeed divine! V There, watching high the least alarms, Thy rough, rude fortress gleams afar; Like some bold vet'ran, grey in arms, And mark'd with many a seamy scar: The pond'rous wall and massy bar, Grim-rising o'er the rugged rock, Have oft withstood assailing war, And oft repell'd th'invader's shock. VI With awe-struck thought and pitying tears, I view that noble, stately dome, Where Scotia's kings of other years, Fam'd heroes! had their royal home: Alas, how chang'd the times to come! Their royal name low in the dust! Their hapless race wild-wand'ring roam! Tho' rigid Law cries out: ‘'Twas just’ VII Wild beats my heart to trace your steps, Whose ancestors, in days of yore, Thro' hostile ranks and ruin'd gaps Old Scotia's bloody lion bore: Ev'n I, who sing in rustic lore, Haply my sires have left their shed, And fac'd grim Danger's loudest roar, Bold-following where your fathers led! VIII Edina! Scotia's darling seat! All hail thy palaces and tow'rs; Where once, beneath a Monarch's feet, Sat Legislation's sov'reign pow'rs: From marking wildly-scatt'red flow'rs, As on the banks of Ayr I stray'd, And singing, lone, the ling'ring hours, I shelter in thy honour'd shade. SONGS JOHN BARLEYCORN A Ballad I There was three kings into the east, Three kings both great and high, And they hae sworn a solemn oath John Barleycorn should die. II They took a plough and plough'd him down, Put clods upon his head, And they hae sworn a solemn oath John Barleycorn was dead. III But the cheerful Spring came kindly on, And show'rs began to fall; John Barleycorn got up again, And sore surpris'd them all. IV The sultry suns of Summer came, And he grew thick and strong: His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears, That no one should him wrong. V The sober Autumn enter'd mild, When he grew wan and pale; His bending joints and drooping head Show'd he began to fail. VI His colour sicken'd more and more, He faded into age; And then his enemies began To show their deadly rage. VII They've taen a weapon long and sharp, And cut him by the knee; Then ty'd him fast upon a cart, Like a rogue for forgerie. VIII They laid him down upon his back, And cudgell'd him full sore. They hung him up before the storm, And turn'd him o'er and o'er. IX They fillèd up a darksome pit With water to the brim, They heavèd in John Barleycorn— There, let him sink or swim! X They laid him out upon the floor, To work him farther woe; And still, as signs of life appear'd, They toss'd him to and fro. XI They wasted o'er a scorching flame The marrow of his bones; But a miller us'd him worst of all, For he crush'd him between two stones. XII And they hae taen his very heart's blood, And drank it round and round; And still the more and more they drank, Their joy did more abound. XIII John Barleycorn was a hero bold, Of noble enterprise; For if you do but taste his blood, 'Twill make your courage rise. XIV 'Twill make a man forget his woe; 'Twill heighten all his joy: 'Twill make the widow's heart to sing, Tho' the tear were in her eye. XV Then let us toast John Barleycorn, Each man a glass in hand; And may his great posterity Ne'er fail in old Scotlànd! A FRAGMENT: WHEN GUILFORD GOOD Tune: Gillicrankie I When Guilford good our pilot stood, An' did our hellim thraw, man; Ae night, at tea, began a plea, Within Americà, man: Then up they gat the maskin-pat, And in the sea did jaw, man; An' did nae less, in full Congress, Than quite refuse our law, man. II Then thro' the lakes Montgomery takes, I wat he was na slaw, man; Down Lowrie's Burn he took a turn, And Carleton did ca', man: But yet, whatreck, he at Quebec Montgomery-like did fa', man, Wi' sword in hand, before his band, Amang his en'mies a', man. III Poor Tammy Gage within a cage Was kept at Boston-ha', man; Till Willie Howe took o'er the knowe For Philadelphià, man; Wi' sword an' gun he thought a sin Guid Christian bluid to draw, man; But at New-York wi' knife an' fork Sir-Loin he hackèd sma', man. IV Burgoyne gaed up, like spur an' whip, Till Fraser brave did fa', man; Then lost his way, ae misty day, In Saratoga shaw, man. Cornwallis fought as lang's he dought, An' did the buckskins claw, man; But Clinton's glaive frae rust to save, He hung it to the wa', man. V Then Montague, an' Guilford too, Began to fear a fa', man; And Sackville doure, wha stood the stoure The German chief to thraw, man: For Paddy Burke, like onie Turk, Nae mercy had at a', man; An' Charlie Fox threw by the box, An' lows'd his tinkler jaw, man. VI Then Rockingham took up the game, Till death did on him ca', man; When Shelburne meek held up his cheek, Conform to gospel law, man: Saint Stephen's boys, wi' jarring noise, They did his measures thraw, man; For North an' Fox united stocks, An' bore him to the wa,' man. VII Then clubs an' hearts were Charlie's cartes: He swept the stakes awa', man, Till the diamond's ace, of Indian race, Led him a sair faux pas, man: The Saxon lads, wi loud placads, On Chatham's boy did ca', man; An' Scotland drew her pipe an' blew: ‘Up, Willie, waur them a', man!’ VIII Behind the throne then Granville's gone, A secret word or twa, man; While slee Dundas arous'd the class Be-north the Roman wa', man: An' Chatham's wraith, in heav'nly graith, (Inspirèd bardies saw, man), Wi' kindling eyes, cry'd: ‘Willie, rise! Would I hae fear'd them a', man?’ IX But, word an' blow, North, Fox, and Co. Gowff'd Willie like a ba', man, Till Suthron raise an' coost their claise Behind him in a raw, man: An' Caledon threw by the drone, An' did her whittle draw, man; An' swoor fu' rude, thro' dirt an' bluid, To mak it guid in law, man. MY NANIE, O I Behind yon hills where Lugar flows 'Mang moors an' mosses many, O, The wintry sun the day has clos'd, And I'll awa to Nanie, O. II The westlin wind blaws loud an' shill, The night's baith mirk and rainy, O; But I'll get my plaid, an' out I'll steal, An' owre the hill to Nanie, O. III My Nanie's charming, sweet, an' young; Nae artfu' wiles to win ye, O: May ill befa' the flattering tongue That wad beguile my Nanie, O! IV Her face is fair, her heart is true; As spotless as she's bonie, O, The op'ning gowan, wat wi' dew, Nae purer is than Nanie, O. V A country lad is my degree, An' few there be that ken me, O; But what care I how few they be? I'm welcome ay to Nanie, O. VI My riches a's my penny-fee, An' I maun guide it cannie, O; But warl's gear ne'er troubles me, My thoughts are a'—my Nanie, O. VII Our auld guidman delights to view His sheep an' kye thrive bonie, O; But I'm as blythe that hauds his pleugh, An' has nae care but Nanie, O. VIII Come weel, come woe, I care na by; I'll tak what Heav'n will send me, O: Nae ither care in life have I, But live, an' love my Nanie, O. GREEN GROW THE RASHES, O Chorus Green grow the rashes, O; Green grow the rashes, O; The sweetest hours that e'er I spend, Are spent among the lasses, O. I There's nought but care on ev'ry han', In every hour that passes, O: What signifies the life o' man, An' 'twere na for the lasses, O. II The war'ly race may riches chase, An' riches still may fly them, O; An' tho' at last they catch them fast, Their hearts can ne'er enjoy them, O. III But gie me a cannie hour at e'en, My arms about my dearie, O, An' war'ly cares an' war'ly men May a' gae tapsalteerie, O! IV For you sae douce, ye sneer at this; Ye're nought but senseless asses, O: The wisest man the warl' e'er saw, He dearly lov'd the lasses, O. V Auld Nature swears, the lovely dears Her noblest work she classes, O: Her prentice han' she try'd on man, An' then she made the lasses, O. Chorus Green grow the rashes, O; Green grow the rashes, O; The sweetest hours that e'er I spend, Are spent among the lasses, O. COMPOSED IN SPRING Tune: Johnny's Grey Breeks I Again rejoicing Nature sees Her robe assume its vernal hues: Her leafy locks wave in the breeze, All freshly steep'd in morning dews. Chorus And maun I still on Menie doat, And bear the scorn that's in her e'e? For it's jet, jet-black, an' it's like a hawk, An' it winna let a body be. II In vain to me the cowslips blaw, In vain to me the vi'lets spring; In vain to me in glen or shaw, The mavis and the lintwhite sing. III The merry ploughboy cheers his team, Wi' joy the tentie seedsman stalks; But life to me's a weary dream, A dream of ane that never wauks. IV The wanton coot the water skims, Amang the reeds the ducklings cry, The stately swan majestic swims, And ev'ry thing is blest but I. V The sheep-herd steeks his faulding slap, And o'er the moorlands whistles shill; Wi' wild, unequal, wand'ring step, I meet him on the dewy hill. VI And when the lark, 'tween light and dark, Blythe waukens by the daisy's side, And mounts and sings on flittering wings, A woe-worn ghaist I hameward glide. VII Come winter, with thine angry howl, And raging, bend the naked tree; Thy gloom will soothe my cheerless soul, When nature all is sad like me! Chorus And maun I still on Menie doat, And bear the scorn that's in her e'e? For it's jet, jet-black, an' it's like a hawk, An' it winna let a body be. THE GLOOMY NIGHT IS GATHERING FAST Tune: Roslin Castle I The gloomy night is gath'ring fast, Loud roars the wild inconstant blast; Yon murky cloud is filled with rain, I see it driving o'er the plain; The hunter now has left the moor, The scatt'red coveys meet secure; While here I wander, prest with care, Along the lonely banks of Ayr. II The Autumn mourns her rip'ning corn By early Winter's ravage torn; Across her placid, azure sky, She sees the scowling tempest fly; Chill runs my blood to hear it rave: I think upon the stormy wave, Where many a danger I must dare, Far from the bonie banks of Ayr. III 'Tis not the surging billows' roar, 'Tis not that fatal, deadly shore; Tho' death in ev'ry shape appear, The wretched have no more to fear: But round my heart the ties are bound, That heart transpierc'd with many a wound; These bleed afresh, those ties I tear, To leave the bonie banks of Ayr. IV Farewell, old Coila's hills and dales, Her heathy moors and winding vales; The scenes where wretched Fancy roves, Pursuing past unhappy loves! Farewell my friends! farewell my foes! My peace with these, my love with those— The bursting tears my heart declare, Farewell, my bonie banks of Ayr. NO CHURCHMAN AM I Tune: Prepare, my dear Brethren I No churchman am I for to rail and to write, No statesman nor soldier to plot or to fight, No sly man of business contriving a snare, For a big-belly'd bottle's the whole of my care. II The peer I don't envy, I give him his bow; I scorn not the peasant, tho' ever so low; But a club of good fellows, like those that are here, And a bottle like this, are my glory and care. III Here passes the squire on his brother—his horse, There centum per centum, the cit with his purse, But see you The Crown, how it waves in the air? There a big-belly'd bottle still eases my care. IV The wife of my bosom, alas! she did die; For sweet consolation to church I did fly; I found that old Solomon provèd it fair, That a big-belly'd bottle's a cure for all care. V I once was persuaded a venture to make; A letter inform'd me that all was to wreck; But the pursy old landlord just waddlèd up stairs, With a glorious bottle that ended my cares. VI ‘Life's cares they are comforts’—a maxim laid down By the Bard, what d'ye call him? that wore the black gown; And faith I agree with th'old prig to a hair: For a big-belly'd bottle's a heav'n of a care. A STANZA ADDED IN A MASON LODGE Then fill up a bumper and make it o'erflow, And honours Masonic prepare for to throw: May ev'ry true Brother of the Compass and Square Have a big-belly'd bottle, when harass'd with care! ADDED, EDINBURGH 1793 WRITTEN IN FRIARS CARSE HERMITAGE, ON NITHSIDE Thou whom chance may hither lead, Be thou clad in russet weed, Be thou deckt in silken stole, Grave these counsels on thy soul. Life is but a day at most, Sprung from night,—in darkness lost: Hope not sunshine ev'ry hour, Fear not clouds will always lour. As Youth and Love with sprightly dance Beneath thy morning star advance, Pleasure with her siren air May delude the thoughtless pair: Let Prudence bless Enjoyment's cup, Then raptur'd sip, and sip it up. As thy day grows warm and high, Life's meridian flaming nigh, Dost thou spurn the humble vale? Life's proud summits would'st thou scale? Check thy climbing step, elate, Evils lurk in felon wait: Dangers, eagle-pinioned, bold, Soar around each cliffy hold; While cheerful Peace with linnet song Chants the lowly dells among. As the shades of ev'ning close, Beck'ning thee to long repose; As life itself becomes disease, Seek the chimney-nook of ease: There ruminate with sober thought, On all thou'st seen, and heard, and wrought; And teach the sportive younkers round, Saws of experience, sage and sound: Say, man's true, genuine estimate, The grand criterion of his fate, Is not, Art thou high or low? Did thy fortune ebb or flow? Did many talents gild thy span? Or frugal Nature grudge thee one? Tell them, and press it on their mind, As thou thyself must shortly find, The smile or frown of awful Heav'n To Virtue or to Vice is giv'n; Say, to be just, and kind, and wise— There solid self-enjoyment lies; That foolish, selfish, faithless ways Lead to be wretched, vile, and base. Thus resign'd and quiet, creep To the bed of lasting sleep: Sleep, whence thou shall ne'er awake, Night, where dawn shall never break; Till future life, future no more, To light and joy the good restore, To light and joy unknown before. Stranger, go! Heav'n be thy guide! Quod the beadsman of Nithside. ODE, SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF MRS. OSWALD OF AUCHENCRUIVE Dweller in yon dungeon dark, Hangman of creation, mark! Who in widow-weeds appears, Laden with unhonoured years, Noosing with care a bursting purse, Baited with many a deadly curse? STROPHE View the wither'd beldam's face: Can thy keen inspection trace Aught of Humanity's sweet, melting grace? Note that eye, 'tis rheum o'erflows— Pity's flood there never rose. See those hands, ne'er stretch'd to save, Hands that took, but never gave. Keeper of Mammon's iron chest, Lo, there she goes, unpitied and unblest, She goes, but not to realms of everlasting rest! ANTISTROPHE Plunderer of Armies! lift thine eyes (A while forbear, ye torturing fiends), Seest thou whose step, unwilling, hither bends? No fallen angel, hurl'd from upper skies! 'Tis thy trusty, quondam Mate, Doom'd to share thy fiery fate: She, tardy, hell-ward plies. EPODE And are they of no more avail, Ten thousand glittering pounds a-year? In other worlds can Mammon fail, Omnipotent as he is here? O bitter mockery of the pompous bier! While down the wretched vital part is driven, The cave-lodg'd beggar, with a conscience clear, Expires in rags, unknown, and goes to Heaven. ELEGY ON CAPTAIN MATTHEW HENDERSON A GENTLEMAN WHO HELD THE PATENT FOR HIS HONOURS IMMEDIATELY FROM ALMIGHTY GOD! But now his radiant course is run, For Matthew's course was bright: His soul was like the glorious sun A matchless, Heavenly light. I O Death! thou tyrant fell and bloody! The meikle Devil wi' a woodie Haurl thee hame to his black smiddie O'er hurcheon hides, And like stock-fish come o'er his studdie Wi' thy auld sides! II He's gane, he's gane! he's frae us torn, The ae best fellow e'er was born! Thee, Matthew, Nature's sel shall mourn, By wood and wild, Where, haply, Pity strays forlorn, Frae man exil'd. III Ye hills, near neebors o' the starns, That proudly cock your cresting cairns! Ye cliffs, the haunts of sailing yearns, Where Echo slumbers! Come join ye, Nature's sturdiest bairns, My wailing numbers! IV Mourn, ilka grove the cushat kens! Ye hazly shaws and briery dens! Ye burnies, wimplin down your glens Wi' toddlin din, Or foaming, strang, wi' hasty stens, Frae lin to lin! V Mourn, little harebells o'er the lea; Ye stately foxgloves, fair to see; Ye woodbines, hanging bonilie In scented bowers; Ye roses on your thorny tree, The first o' flowers! VI At dawn, when every grassy blade Droops with a diamond at his head; At ev'n, when beans their fragrance shed I' th'rustling gale; Ye maukins, whiddin through the glade; Come join my wail! VII Mourn, ye wee songsters o' the wood; Ye grouse that crap the heather bud; Ye curlews, calling thro' a clud; Ye whistling plover; And mourn, ye whirring paitrick brood: He's gane for ever! VIII Mourn, sooty coots, and speckled teals; Ye fisher herons, watching eels; Ye duck and drake, wi' airy wheels Circling the lake; Ye bitterns, till the quagmire reels, Rair for his sake! IX Mourn, clam'ring craiks, at close o' day, 'Mang fields o' flow'ring clover gay! And when you wing your annual way Frae our cauld shore, Tell thae far warlds wha lies in clay, Wham we deplore. X Ye houlets, frae your ivy bower In some auld tree, or eldritch tower, What time the moon, wi' silent glowr, Sets up her horn, Wail thro' the dreary midnight hour Till waukrife morn! XI O rivers, forests, hills, and plains! Oft have ye heard my canty strains: But now, what else for me remains But tales of woe? And frae my een the drapping rains Maun ever flow. XII Mourn, Spring, thou darling of the year! Ilk cowslip cup shall kep a tear: Thou, Simmer, while each corny spear Shoots up its head, Thy gay, green, flowery tresses shear For him that's dead! XIII Thou, Autumn, wi' thy yellow hair, In grief thy sallow mantle tear! Thou, Winter, hurling thro' the air The roaring blast, Wide o'er the naked world declare The worth we've lost! XIV Mourn him, thou Sun, great source of light! Mourn, Empress of the silent night! And you, ye twinkling starnies bright, My Matthew mourn! For through your orbs he's taen his flight, Ne'er to return. XV O Henderson! the man! the brother! And art thou gone, and gone for ever? And hast thou crost that unknown river, Life's dreary bound? Like thee, where shall I find another, The world around? XVI Go to your sculptur'd tombs, ye Great, In a' the tinsel trash o' state! But by thy honest turf I'll wait, Thou man of worth! And weep the ae best fellow's fate E'er lay in earth! THE EPITAPH I Stop, passenger! my story's brief, And truth I shall relate, man: I tell nae common tale o' grief, For Matthew was a great man. II If thou uncommon merit hast, Yet spurn'd at Fortune's door, man; A look of pity hither cast, For Matthew was a poor man. III If thou a noble sodger art, That passest by this grave, man; There moulders here a gallant heart, For Matthew was a brave man. IV If thou on men, their works and ways, Canst throw uncommon light, man; Here lies wha weel had won thy praise, For Matthew was a bright man. V If thou, at Friendship's sacred ca', Wad life itself resign, man; Thy sympathetic tear maun fa', For Matthew was a kind man. VI If thou art staunch, without a stain, Like the unchanging blue, man; This was a kinsman o' thy ain, For Matthew was a true man. VII If thou hast wit, and fun, and fire, And ne'er guid wine did fear, man; This was thy billie, dam, and sire, For Matthew was a queer man. VIII If onie whiggish, whingin sot, To blame poor Matthew dare, man; May dool and sorrow be his lot! For Matthew was a rare man. LAMENT OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING I Now Nature hangs her mantle green On every blooming tree, And spreads her sheets o' daisies white Out o'er the grassy lea; Now Phœbus cheers the crystal streams, And glads the azure skies: But nought can glad the weary wight That fast in durance lies. II Now laverocks wake the merry morn, Aloft on dewy wing; The merle, in his noontide bow'r, Makes woodland echoes ring; The mavis wild wi' monie a note Sings drowsy day to rest: In love and freedom they rejoice, Wi' care nor thrall opprest. III Now blooms the lily by the bank, The primrose down the brae; The hawthorn's budding in the glen, And milk-white is the slae: The meanest hind in fair Scotland May rove their sweets amang; But I, the Queen of a' Scotland Maun lie in prison strang. IV I was the Queen o' bonie France, Where happy I hae been; Fu' lightly rase I in the morn, As blythe lay down at e'en: And I'm the sov'reign of Scotland, And monie a traitor there; Yet here I lie in foreign bands And never-ending care. V But as for thee, thou false woman, My sister and my fae, Grim vengeance yet shall whet a sword That thro' thy soul shall gae! The weeping blood in woman's breast Was never known to thee; Nor th'balm that draps on wounds of woe Frae woman's pitying e'e. VI My son! my son! my kinder stars Upon thy fortune shine; And may those pleasures gild thy reign, That ne'er wad blink on mine! God keep thee frae thy mother's faes, Or turn their hearts to thee; And where thou meet'st thy mother's friend, Remember him for me! VII O! soon, to me, may summer suns Nae mair light up the morn! Nae mair to me the autumn winds Wave o'er the yellow corn! And, in the narrow house of death, Let winter round me rave; And the next flow'rs that deck the spring Bloom on my peaceful grave. TO ROBERT GRAHAM OF FINTRY, ESQ. Late crippl'd of an arm, and now a leg; About to beg a pass for leave to beg; Dull, listless, teas'd, dejected, and deprest (Nature is adverse to a cripple's rest); Will generous Graham list to his Poet's wail (It soothes poor Misery, hearkening to her tale), And hear him curse the light he first survey'd, And doubly curse the luckless rhyming trade? Thou, Nature! partial Nature! I arraign; Of thy caprice maternal I complain: The lion and the bull thy care have found, One shakes the forests, and one spurns the ground; Thou giv'st the ass his hide, the snail his shell; Th' envenom'd wasp, victorious, guards his cell; Thy minions kings defend, control, devour, In all th'omnipotence of rule and power. Foxes and statesmen subtile wiles ensure; The cit and polecat stink, and are secure; Toads with their poison, doctors with their drug, The priest and hedgehog in their robes, are snug; Ev'n silly woman has her warlike arts, Her tongue and eyes—her dreaded spear and darts But O thou bitter step-mother and hard, To thy poor, fenceless, naked child—the Bard! A thing unteachable in world's skill, And half an idiot too, more helpless still: No heels to bear him from the op'ning dun, No claws to dig, his hated sight to shun; No horns, but those by luckless Hymen worn, And those, alas! not, Amalthea's horn; No nerves olfact'ry, Mammon's trusty cur, Clad in rich Dulness' comfortable fur; In naked feeling, and in aching pride, He bears th'unbroken blast from ev'ry side: Vampyre booksellers drain him to the heart, And scorpion critics cureless venom dart. Critics—appall'd, I venture on the name; Those cut-throat bandits in the paths of fame; Bloody dissectors, worse than ten Monroes: He hacks to teach, they mangle to expose. His heart by causeless wanton malice wrung, By blockheads' daring into madness stung; His well-won bays, than life itself more dear, By miscreants torn, who ne'er one sprig must wear; Foil'd, bleeding, tortur'd in th'unequal strife, The hapless Poet flounders on thro' life: Till, fled each hope that once his bosom fir'd, And fled each Muse that glorious once inspir'd, Low sunk in squalid, unprotected age, Dead even resentment for his injur'd page, He heeds or feels no more the ruthless critic's rage! So, by some hedge, the gen'rous steed deceas'd, For half-starv'd snarling curs a dainty feast, By toil and famine wore to skin and bone, Lies, senseless of each tugging bitch's son. O Dulness! portion of the truly blest! Calm shelter'd haven of eternal rest! Thy sons ne'er madden in the fierce extremes Of Fortune's polar frost, or torrid beams. If mantling high she fills the golden cup, With sober, selfish ease they sip it up: Conscious the bounteous meed they well deserve, They only wonder ‘some folks’ do not starve. The grave, sage hern thus easy picks his frog, And thinks the mallard a sad, worthless dog. When Disappointment snaps the clue of hope, And thro' disastrous night they darkling grope, With deaf endurance sluggishly they bear, And just conclude ‘that fools are fortune's care.’ So, heavy, passive to the tempest's shocks, Strong on the sign-post stands the stupid ox. Not so the idle Muses' mad-cap train; Not such the workings of their moon-struck brain: In equanimity they never dwell; By turns in soaring heav'n, or vaulted hell. I dread thee, Fate, relentless and severe, With all a poet's, husband's, father's fear! Already one strong hold of hope is lost: Glencairn, the truly noble, lies in dust (Fled, like the sun eclips'd as noon appears, And left us darkling in a world of tears). O, hear my ardent, grateful, selfish pray'r! Fintry, my other stay, long bless and spare! Thro' a long life his hopes and wishes crown, And bright in cloudless skies his sun go down! May bliss domestic smooth his private path; Give energy to life; and soothe his latest breath, With many a filial tear circling the bed of death! LAMENT FOR JAMES EARL OF GLENCAIRN I The wind blew hollow frae the hills; By fits the sun's departing beam Look'd on the fading yellow woods, That wav'd o'er Lugar's winding stream. Beneath a craigy steep a Bard, Laden with years and meikle pain, In loud lament bewail'd his lord, Whom Death had all untimely taen. II He lean'd him to an ancient aik, Whose trunk was mould'ring down with years; His locks were bleachèd white with time, His hoary cheek was wet wi' tears; And as he touch'd his trembling harp, And as he tun'd his doleful sang, The winds, lamenting thro' their caves, To echo bore the notes alang:— III ‘Ye scatter'd birds that faintly sing, The reliques of the vernal quire! Ye woods that shed on a' the winds The honours of the agèd year! A few short months, and, glad and gay, Again ye'll charm the ear and e'e; But nocht in all revolving time Can gladness bring again to me. IV ‘I am a bending aged tree, That long has stood the wind and rain; But now has come a cruel blast, And my last hold of earth is gane; Nae leaf o' mine shall greet the spring, Nae simmer sun exalt my bloom; But I maun lie before the storm, And ithers plant them in my room. V ‘I've seen sae monie changefu' years, On earth I am a stranger grown: I wander in the ways of men, Alike unknowing and unknown: Unheard, unpitied, unreliev'd, I bear alane my lade o' care; For silent, low, on beds of dust, Lie a' that would my sorrows share. VI ‘And last (the sum of a' my griefs!) My noble master lies in clay; The flow'r amang our barons bold, His country's pride, his country's stay: In weary being now I pine, For a' the life of life is dead, And hope has left my agèd ken, On forward wing for ever fled. VII ‘Awake thy last sad voice, my harp! The voice of woe and wild despair! Awake, resound thy latest lay, Then sleep in silence evermair! And thou, my last, best, only friend, That fillest an untimely tomb, Accept this tribute from the Bard Thou brought from Fortune's mirkest gloom VIII ‘In Poverty's low barren vale, Thick mists obscure involv'd me round; Though oft I turn'd the wistful eye, Nae ray of fame was to be found; Thou found'st me, like the morning sun That melts the fogs in limpid air: The friendless Bard and rustic song Became alike thy fostering care. IX ‘O, why has Worth so short a date, While villains ripen grey with time! Must thou, the noble, gen'rous, great, Fall in bold manhood's hardy prime? Why did I live to see that day, A day to me so full of woe? O, had I met the mortal shaft Which laid my benefactor low! X ‘The bridegroom may forget the bride Was made his wedded wife yestreen; The monarch may forget the crown That on his head an hour has been; The mother may forget the child That smiles sae sweetly on her knee; But I'll remember thee, Glencairn, And a' that thou hast done for me!’ LINES TO SIR JOHN WHITEFOORD, Bart. SENT WITH THE FOREGOING POEM Thou, who thy honour as thy God rever'st, Who, save thy mind's reproach, nought earthly fear'st, To thee this votive off'ring I impart, The tearful tribute of a broken heart. The Friend thou valued'st, I the Patron lov'd; His worth, his honour, all the world approv'd: We'll mourn till we too go as he has gone, And tread the shadowy path to that dark world unknown. TAM O' SHANTER A TALE Of Brownyis and of Bogillis full is this Buke. GAWIN DOUGLAS. When chapman billies leave the street, And drouthy neebors neebors meet; As market-days are wearing late, An' folk begin to tak the gate; While we sit bousing at the nappy, An' getting fou and unco happy, We think na on the lang Scots miles, The mosses, waters, slaps, and styles, That lie between us and our hame, Whare sits our sulky, sullen dame, Gathering her brows like gathering storm, Nursing her wrath to keep it warm. This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter, As he frae Ayr ae night did canter: (Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses, For honest men and bonie lasses). O Tam, had'st thou but been sae wise, As taen thy ain wife Kate's advice! She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum, A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum; That frae November till October, Ae market-day thou was nae sober; That ilka melder wi' the miller, Thou sat as lang as thou had siller; That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on, The smith and thee gat roaring fou on; That at the Lord's house, even on Sunday, Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday. She prophesied, that, late or soon, Thou would be found deep drown'd in Doon, Or catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk By Alloway's auld, haunted kirk. Ah! gentle dames, it gars me greet, To think how monie counsels sweet, How monie lengthen'd, sage advices The husband frae the wife despises! But to our tale:—Ae market-night, Tam had got planted unco right, Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely, Wi' reaming swats, that drank divinely; And at his elbow, Souter Johnie, His ancient, trusty, drouthy cronie: Tam lo'ed him like a very brither; They had been fou for weeks thegither. The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter; And ay the ale was growing better: The landlady and Tam grew gracious Wi' secret favours, sweet and precious: The Souter tauld his queerest stories; The landlord's laugh was ready chorus: The storm without might rair and rustle, Tam did na mind the storm a whistle. Care, mad to see a man sae happy, E'en drown'd himsel amang the nappy. As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure, The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure: Kings may be blest but Tam was glorious, O'er a' the ills o' life victorious! But pleasures are like poppies spread: You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed; Or like the snow falls in the river, A moment white—then melts for ever; Or like the borealis race, That flit ere you can point their place; Or like the rainbow's lovely form Evanishing amid the storm. Nae man can tether time or tide; The hour approaches Tam maun ride: That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane, That dreary hour Tam mounts his beast in; And sic a night he taks the road in, As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in. The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last; The rattling showers rose on the blast; The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd; Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellow'd: That night, a child might understand, The Deil had business on his hand. Weel mounted on his gray mare Meg, A better never lifted leg, Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire, Despising wind, and rain, and fire; Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet, Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet, Whiles glow'ring round wi' prudent cares, Lest bogles catch him unawares: Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh, Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry. By this time he was cross the ford, Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor'd; And past the birks and meikle stane, Whare drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane; And thro' the whins, and by the cairn, Whare hunters fand the murder'd bairn; And near the thorn, aboon the well, Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel. Before him Doon pours all his floods; The doubling storm roars thro' the woods; The lightnings flash from pole to pole; Near and more near the thunders roll: When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees, Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze, Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing, And loud resounded mirth and dancing. Inspiring bold John Barleycorn, What dangers thou canst make us scorn! Wi' tippenny, we fear nae evil; Wi' usquabae, we'll face the Devil! The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle, Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle. But Maggie stood, right sair astonish'd, Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd, She ventur'd forward on the light; And, vow! Tam saw an unco sight! Warlocks and witches in a dance: Nae cotillion, brent new frae France, But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels, Put life and mettle in their heels. A winnock-bunker in the east, There sat Auld Nick, in shape o' beast; A tousie tyke, black, grim, and large, To gie them music was his charge: He screw'd the pipes and gart them skirl, Till roof and rafters a' did dirl. Coffins stood round, like open presses, That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses; And, by some devilish cantraip sleight, Each in its cauld hand held a light: By which heroic Tam was able To note upon the haly table, A murderer's banes, in gibbet-airns; Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen'd bairns; A thief new-cutted frae a rape— Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape; Five tomahawks wi' bluid red-rusted; Five scymitars wi' murder crusted; A garter which a babe had strangled; A knife a father's throat had mangled— Whom his ain son o' life bereft— The grey-hairs yet stack to the heft; Wi' mair of horrible and awefu', Which even to name wad be unlawfu'. As Tammie glowr'd, amaz'd, and curious, The mirth and fun grew fast and furious; The piper loud and louder blew, The dancers quick and quicker flew, They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit. Till ilka carlin swat and reekit, And coost her duddies to the wark, And linket at it in her sark! Now Tam, O Tam! had thae been queans, A' plump and strapping in their teens! Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen, Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen!— Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair, That ance were plush, o' guid blue hair, I wad hae gi'en them off my hurdies For ae blink o' the bonie burdies! But wither'd beldams, auld and droll, Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal, Louping and flinging on a crummock, I wonder did na turn thy stomach! But Tam kend what was what fu' brawlie: There was ae winsome wench and wawlie, That night enlisted in the core, Lang after kend on Carrick shore (For monie a beast to dead she shot, An' perish'd monie a bonie boat, And shook baith meikle corn and bear, And kept the country-side in fear). Her cutty sark, o' Paisley harn, That while a lassie she had worn, In longitude tho' sorely scanty, It was her best, and she was vauntie. . . . Ah! little kend thy reverend grannie, That sark she coft for her wee Nannie, Wi' twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches), Wad ever grac'd a dance of witches! But here my Muse her wing maun cour, Sic flights are far beyond her power: To sing how Nannie lap and flang (A souple jad she was and strang), And how Tam stood like ane bewitch'd, And thought his very een enrich'd; Even Satan glowr'd, and fidg'd fu' fain, And hotch'd and blew wi' might and main; Till first ae caper, syne anither, Tam tint his reason a' thegither, And roars out: ‘Weel done, Cutty-sark!’ And in an instant all was dark; And scarcely had he Maggie rallied, When out the hellish legion sallied. As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke, When plundering herds assail their byke; As open pussie's mortal foes, When, pop! she starts before their nose; As eager runs the market-crowd, When ‘Catch the thief!’ resounds aloud: So Maggie runs, the witches follow, Wi' monie an eldritch skriech and hollo. Ah, Tam! Ah, Tam! thou'll get thy fairin! In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin! In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin! Kate soon will be a woefu' woman! Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg, And win the key-stane of the brig; There, at them thou thy tail may toss, A running stream they dare na cross! But ere the key-stane she could make, The fient a tail she had to shake; For Nannie, far before the rest, Hard upon noble Maggie prest, And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle; But little wist she Maggie's mettle! Ae spring brought off her master hale, But left behind her ain grey tail: The carlin claught her by the rump, And left poor Maggie scarce a stump. Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read, Ilk man, and mother's son, take heed: Whene'er to drink you are inclin'd, Or cutty sarks run in your mind, Think! ye may buy the joys o'er dear: Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare. ON SEEING A WOUNDED HARE LIMP BY ME WHICH A FELLOW HAD JUST SHOT AT I Inhuman man! curse on thy barb'rous art, And blasted be thy murder-aiming eye; May never pity soothe thee with a sigh, Nor never pleasure glad thy cruel heart! II Go live, poor wanderer of the wood and field, The bitter little that of life remains! No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains To thee shall home, or food, or pastime yield. III Seek, manglèd wretch, some place of wonted rest, No more of rest, but now thy dying bed! The sheltering rushes whistling o'er thy head, The cold earth with thy bloody bosom prest. IV Oft as by winding Nith I, musing, wait The sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn, I'll miss thee sporting o'er the dewy lawn, And curse the ruffian's aim, and mourn thy hapless fate. ADDRESS TO THE SHADE OF THOMSON ON CROWNING HIS BUST AT EDNAM, ROXBURGHSHIRE, WITH A WREATH OF BAYS I While virgin Spring by Eden's flood Unfolds her tender mantle green, Or pranks the sod in frolic mood, Or tunes Eolian strains between: II While Summer, with a matron grace, Retreats to Dryburgh's cooling shade, Yet oft, delighted, stops to trace The progress of the spikey blade: III While Autumn, benefactor kind, By Tweed erects his aged head, And sees, with self-approving mind, Each creature on his bounty fed: IV While maniac Winter rages o'er The hills whence classic Yarrow flows, Rousing the turbid torrent's roar, Or sweeping, wild, a waste of snows: V So long, sweet Poet of the year! Shall bloom that wreath thou well has won; While Scotia, with exulting tear, Proclaims that Thomson was her son. ON THE LATE CAPTAIN GROSE'S PEREGRINATIONS THRO' SCOTLAND COLLECTING THE ANTIQUITIES OF THAT KINGDOM I Hear, Land o' Cakes, and brither Scots Frae Maidenkirk to Johnie Groat's, If there's a hole in a' your coats, I rede you tent it: A chield's amang you takin notes, And faith he'll prent it: II If in your bounds ye chance to light Upon a fine, fat, fodgel wight, O' stature short but genius bright, That's he, mark weel: And wow! he has an unco sleight O' cauk and keel. III By some auld, houlet-haunted biggin, Or kirk deserted by its riggin, It's ten to ane ye'll find him snug in Some eldritch part, Wi' deils, they say, Lord safe's! colleaguin At some black art. IV Ilk ghaist that haunts auld ha' or chamer, Ye gipsy-gang that deal in glamour, And you, deep-read in hell's black grammar, Warlocks and witches: Ye'll quake at his conjúring hammer, Ye midnight bitches! V It's tauld he was a sodger bred, And ane wad rather fa'n than fled; But now he's quat the spurtle-blade And dog-skin wallet, And taen the—Antiquarian trade, I think they call it. VI He has a fouth o' auld nick-nackets: Rusty airn caps and jinglin jackets Wad haud the Lothians three in tackets A towmont guid; And parritch-pats and auld saut-backets Before the Flood. VII Of Eve's first fire he has a cinder; Auld Tubalcain's fire-shool and fender; That which distinguishèd the gender O' Balaam's ass; A broomstick o' the witch of Endor, Weel shod wi' brass. VIII Forbye, he'll shape you aff fu' gleg The cut of Adam's philibeg; The knife that nicket Abel's craig He'll prove you fully, It was a faulding jocteleg, Or lang-kail gullie. IX But wad ye see him in his glee— For meikle glee and fun has he— Then set him down, and twa or three Guid fellows wi' him; And port, O port! shine thou a wee, And then ye'll see him! X Now, by the Pow'rs o' verse and prose! Thou art a dainty chield, O Grose!— Whae'er o' thee shall ill suppose, They sair misca' thee; I'd take the rascal by the nose, Wad say, ‘Shame fa' thee.’ TO MISS CRUICKSHANK A VERY YOUNG LADY Written on the Blank Leaf of a Book, presented to her by the Author Beauteous Rosebud, young and gay, Blooming on thy early May, Never may'st thou, lovely flower, Chilly shrink in sleety shower! Never Boreas' hoary path, Never Eurus' pois'nous breath, Never baleful stellar lights, Taint thee with untimely blights! Never, never reptile thief Riot on thy virgin leaf! Nor even Sol too fiercely view Thy bosom blushing still with dew! May'st thou long, sweet crimson gem, Richly deck thy native stem; Till some ev'ning, sober, calm, Dropping dews and breathing balm, While all around the woodland rings, And ev'ry bird thy requiem sings, Thou, amid the dirgeful sound, Shed thy dying honours round, And resign to parent Earth The loveliest form she e'er gave birth. SONG: ANNA THY CHARMS I Anna thy charms my bosom fire, And waste my soul with care; But ah! how bootless to admire When fated to despair! II Yet in thy presence, lovely Fair, To hope may be forgiven: For sure 'twere impious to despair So much in sight of Heaven. ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE DEATH OF JOHN M'LEOD, ESQ. BROTHER TO A YOUNG LADY, A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF THE AUTHOR'S I Sad thy tale, thou idle page, And rueful thy alarms: Death tears the brother of her love From Isabella's arms. II Sweetly deckt with pearly dew The morning rose may blow; But cold successive noontide blasts May lay its beauties low. III Fair on Isabella's morn The sun propitious smil'd; But, long ere noon, succeeding clouds Succeeding hopes beguil'd. IV Fate oft tears the bosom-chords That Nature finest strung: So Isabella's heart was form'd, And so that heart was wrung. V Dread Omnipotence alone Can heal the wound he gave— Can point the brimful, grief-worn eyes To scenes beyond the grave. VI Virtue's blossoms there shall blow, And fear no withering blast; There Isabella's spotless worth Shall happy be at last. THE HUMBLE PETITION OF BRUAR WATER TO THE NOBLE DUKE OF ATHOLE I My lord, I know, your noble ear Woe ne'er assails in vain; Embolden'd thus, I beg you'll hear Your humble slave complain, How saucy Phœbus' scorching beams, In flaming summer-pride, Dry-withering, waste my foamy streams, And drink my crystal tide. II The lightly-jumping, glowrin trouts, That thro' my waters play, If, in their random, wanton spouts, They near the margin stray; If, hapless chance! they linger lang, I'm scorching up so shallow, They're left the whitening stanes amang In gasping death to wallow. III Last day I grat wi' spite and teen, As Poet Burns came by, That, to a Bard, I should be seen Wi' half my channel dry; A panegyric rhyme, I ween, Ev'n as I was, he shor'd me; But had I in my glory been, He, kneeling, wad ador'd me. IV Here, foaming down the skelvy rocks, In twisting strength I rin; There high my boiling torrent smokes, Wild-roaring o'er a linn: Enjoying large each spring and well, As Nature gave them me, I am, altho' I say't mysel, Worth gaun a mile to see. V Would, then, my noble master please To grant my highest wishes, He'll shade my banks wi' tow'ring trees And bonie spreading bushes. Delighted doubly then, my lord, You'll wander on my banks, And listen monie a grateful bird Return you tuneful thanks. VI The sober laverock, warbling wild, Shall to the skies aspire; The gowdspink, Music's gayest child, Shall sweetly join the choir; The blackbird strong, the lintwhite clear, The mavis mild and mellow, The robin, pensive Autumn cheer In all her locks of yellow. VII This, too, a covert shall ensure To shield them from the storm; And coward maukin sleep secure, Low in her grassy form: Here shall the shepherd make his seat To weave his crown of flow'rs; Or find a shelt'ring, safe retreat From prone-descending show'rs. VIII And here, by sweet, endearing stealth, Shall meet the loving pair, Despising worlds with all their wealth, As empty idle care: The flow'rs shall vie, in all their charms, The hour of heav'n to grace; And birks extend their fragrant arms To screen the dear embrace. IX Here haply too, at vernal dawn, Some musing Bard may stray, And eye the smoking, dewy lawn And misty mountain grey; Or, by the reaper's nigthly beam, Mild-chequering thro' the trees, Rave to my darkly dashing stream, Hoarse-swelling on the breeze. X Let lofty firs and ashes cool My lowly banks o'erspread, And view, deep-bending in the pool, Their shadows' wat'ry bed: Let fragrant birks, in woodbines drest, My craggy cliffs adorn, And, for the little songster's nest, The close embow'ring thorn! XI So may, old Scotia's darling hope, Your little angel band Spring, like their fathers, up to prop Their honour'd native land! So may, thro' Albion's farthest ken, To social-flowing glasses, The grace be: ‘Athole's honest men And Athole's bonie lasses!’ ON SCARING SOME WATER-FOWL IN LOCH TURIT A WILD SCENE AMONG THE HILLS OF OUGHTERTYRE Why, ye tenants of the lake, For me your wat'ry haunt forsake? Tell me, fellow creatures, why At my presence thus you fly? Why disturb your social joys, Parent, filial, kindred ties?— Common friend to you and me, Nature's gifts to all are free: Peaceful keep your dimpling wave, Busy feed, or wanton lave; Or, beneath the sheltering rock, Bide the surging billow's shock. Conscious, blushing for our race, Soon, too soon, your fears I trace. Man, your proud, usurping foe, Would be lord of all below: Plumes himself in freedom's pride. Tyrant stern to all beside. The eagle, from the cliffy brow Marking you his prey below, In his breast no pity dwells, Strong necessity compels: But Man, to whom alone is giv'n A ray direct from pitying Heav'n, Glories in his heart humane— And creatures for his pleasure slain! In these savage, liquid plains, Only known to wand'ring swains, Where the mossy riv'let strays Far from human haunts and ways, All on Nature you depend, And life's poor season peaceful spend. Or, if Man's superior might Dare invade your native right, On the lofty ether borne, Man with all his powers you scorn; Swiftly seek, on clanging wings, Other lakes, and other springs; And the foe you cannot brave, Scorn at least to be his slave. VERSES WRITTEN WITH A PENCIL OVER THE CHIMNEY-PIECE, IN THE PARLOUR OF THE INN AT KENMORE, TAYMOUTH Admiring Nature in her wildest grace, These northern scenes with weary feet I trace; O'er many a winding dale and painful steep, Th' abodes of covey'd grouse and timid sheep, My savage journey, curious, I pursue, Till fam'd Breadalbane opens to my view. The meeting cliffs each deep-sunk glen divides: The woods, wild-scatter'd, clothe their ample sides; Th' outstretching lake, imbosomed 'mong the hills, The eye with wonder and amazement fills: The Tay meand'ring sweet in infant pride, The palace rising on his verdant side, The lawns wood-fring'd in Nature's native taste, The hillocks dropt in Nature's careless haste, The arches striding o'er the new-born stream, The village glittering in the noontide beam— Poetic ardors in my bosom swell, Lone wand'ring by the hermit's mossy cell; The sweeping theatre of hanging woods, Th' incessant roar of headlong tumbling floods— Here Poesy might wake her heav'n-taught lyre, And look through Nature with creative fire; Here, to the wrongs of Fate half reconcil'd, Misfortune's lighten'd steps might wander wild; And Disappointment, in these lonely bounds, Find balm to soothe her bitter rankling wounds; Here heart-struck Grief might heav'nward stretch her scan, And injur'd Worth forget and pardon man. LINES ON THE FALL OF FYERS NEAR LOCH NESS WRITTEN WITH A PENCIL ON THE SPOT Among the heathy hills and ragged woods The roaring Fyers pours his mossy floods; Till full he dashes on the rocky mounds, Where, thro' a shapeless breach, his stream resounds. As high in air the bursting torrents flow, As deep recoiling surges foam below, Prone down the rock the whitening sheet descends, And viewless Echo's ear, astonish'd, rends. Dim-seen through rising mists and ceaseless show'rs, The hoary cavern, wide-surrounding, lours: Still thro' the gap the struggling river toils, And still, below, the horrid caldron boils— ON THE BIRTH OF A POSTHUMOUS CHILD BORN IN PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF FAMILY DISTRESS I Sweet flow'ret, pledge o' meikle love, And ward o' monie a prayer, What heart o' stane wad thou na move, Sae helpless, sweet, and fair! II November hirples o'er the lea, Chill, on thy lovely form; And gane, alas! the shelt'ring tree, Should shield thee frae the storm III May He who gives the rain to pour, And wings the blast to blaw, Protect thee frae the driving show'r, The bitter frost and snaw! IV May He, the friend of Woe and Want, Who heals life's various stounds, Protect and guard the mother plant, And heal her cruel wounds! V But late she flourish'd, rooted fast, Fair on the summer morn, Now feebly bends she in the blast, Unshelter'd and forlorn. VI Blest be thy bloom, thou lovely gem, Unscath'd by ruffian hand! And from thee many a parent stem Arise to deck our land! THE WHISTLE A Ballad I I sing of a Whistle, a Whistle of worth, I sing of a Whistle, the pride of the North, Was brought to the court of our good Scottish King, And long with this Whistle all Scotland shall ring. II Old Loda, still rueing the arm of Fingal, The God of the Bottle sends down from his hall: ‘This Whistle's your challenge, to Scotland get o'er, And drink them to Hell, Sir! or ne'er see me more!’ III Old poets have sung, and old chronicles tell, What champions ventur'd, what champions fell: The son of great Loda was conqueror still, And blew on the Whistle their requiem shrill. IV Till Robert, the lord of the Cairn and the Scaur, Unmatch'd at the bottle, unconquer'd in war, He drank his poor god-ship as deep as the sea; No tide of the Baltic e'er drunker than he. V Thus Robert, victorious, the trophy has gain'd; Which now in his house has for ages remain'd; Till three noble chieftains, and all of his blood, The jovial contest again have renew'd. VI Three joyous good fellows, with hearts clear of flaw; Craigdarroch, so famous for wit, worth, and law; And trusty Glenriddel, so skilled in old coins; And gallant Sir Robert, deep-read in old wines. VII Craigdarroch began, with a tongue smooth as oil, Desiring Glenriddel to yield up the spoil; Or else he would muster the heads of the clan, And once more, in claret, try which was the man. VIII ‘By the gods of the ancients!’ Glenriddel replies, ‘Before I surrender so glorious a prize, I'll conjure the ghost of the great Rorie More, And bumper his horn with him twenty times o'er.’ IX Sir Robert, a soldier, no speech would pretend. But he ne'er turn'd his back on his foe, or his friend; Said:—‘Toss down the Whistle, the prize of the field,’ And, knee-deep in claret, he'd die ere he'd yield. X To the board of Glenriddel our heroes repair, So noted for drowning of sorrow and care; But for wine and for welcome not more known to fame Than the sense, wit, and taste, of a sweet lovely dame. XI A Bard was selected to witness the fray, And tell future ages the feats of the day; A Bard who detested all sadness and spleen, And wish'd that Parnassus a vineyard had been. XII The dinner being over, the claret they ply, And ev'ry new cork is a new spring of joy; In the bands of old friendship and kindred so set, And the bands grew the tighter the more they were wet. XIII Gay Pleasure ran riot as bumpers ran o'er; Bright Phœbus ne'er witness'd so joyous a core, And vow'd that to leave them he was quite forlorn, Till Cynthia hinted he'd see them next morn. XIV Six bottles a-piece had well wore out the night, When gallant Sir Robert, to finish the fight, Turn'd o'er in one bumper a bottle of red, And swore 'twas the way that their ancestor did. XV Then worthy Glenriddel, so cautious and sage, No longer the warfare ungodly would wage: A high Ruling Elder to wallow in wine! He left the foul business to folks less divine. XVI The gallant Sir Robert fought hard to the end; But who can with Fate and quart bumpers contend? Though Fate said, a hero should perish in light; So uprose bright Phœbus—and down fell the knight. XVII Next uprose our Bard, like a prophet in drink:— ‘Craigdarroch, thou'lt soar when creation shall sink! But if thou would flourish immortal in rhyme, Come—one bottle more—and have at the sublime! XVIII ‘Thy line, that have struggled for freedom with Bruce, Shall heroes and patriots ever produce: So thine be the laurel, and mine be the bay; The field thou hast won, by yon bright God of Day!’</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume II THE JOLLY BEGGARS A CANTATA RECITATIVO I When lyart leaves bestrow the yird, Or, wavering like the bauckie-bird, Bedim cauld Boreas' blast; When hailstanes drive wi' bitter skyte, And infant frosts begin to bite, In hoary cranreuch drest; Ae night at e'en a merry core O' randie, gangrel bodies In Poosie-Nansie's held the splore, To drink their orra duddies: Wi' quaffing and laughing They ranted an' they sang, Wi' jumping an' thumping The vera girdle rang. II First, niest the fire, in auld red rags Ane sat, weel brac'd wi' mealy bags And knapsack a' in order; His doxy lay within his arm; Wi' usquebae an' blankets warm, She blinket on her sodger. An' ay he gies the tozie drab The tither skelpin kiss, While she held up her greedy gab Just like an aumous dish: Ilk smack still did crack still Like onie cadger's whup; Then, swaggering an' staggering, He roar'd this ditty up:— AIR Tune: Soldier's Joy I I am a son of Mars, who have been in many wars, And show my cuts and scars wherever I come: This here was for a wench, and that other in a trench When welcoming the French at the sound of the drum. Lal de daudle, etc. II My prenticeship I past, where my leader breath'd his last, When the bloody die was cast on the heights of Abram; And I servèd out my trade when the gallant game was play'd, And the Moro low was laid at the sound of the drum. III I lastly was with Curtis among the floating batt'ries, And there I left for witness an arm and a limb; Yet let my country need me, with Eliott to head me I'd clatter on my stumps at the sound of the drum. IV And now, tho' I must beg with a wooden arm and leg And many a tatter'd rag hanging over my bum, I'm as happy with my wallet, my bottle, and my callet As when I us'd in scarlet to follow a drum. V What tho' with hoary locks I must stand the winter shocks, Beneath the woods and rocks oftentimes for a home? When the tother bag I sell, and the tother bottle tell, I could meet a troop of Hell at the sound of a drum. Lal de daudle, etc. RECITATIVO He ended; and the kebars sheuk Aboon the chorus roar; While frighted rattons backward leuk, An' seek the benmost bore: A fairy fiddler frae the neuk, He skirl'd out Encore! But up arose the martial chuck, An' laid the loud uproar:— AIR Tune: Sodger Laddie I I once was a maid, tho' I cannot tell when, And still my delight is in proper young men. Some one of a troop of dragoons was my daddie: No wonder I'm fond of a sodger laddie! Sing, lal de dal, etc. II The first of my loves was a swaggering blade: To rattle the thundering drum was his trade; His leg was so tight, and his cheek was so ruddy, Transported I was with my sodger laddie. III But the godly old chaplain left him in the lurch; The sword I forsook for the sake of the church; He riskèd the soul, and I ventur'd the body: 'Twas then I prov'd false to my sodger laddie. IV Full soon I grew sick of my sanctified sot; The regiment at large for a husband I got; From the gilded spontoon to the fife I was ready: I askèd no more but a sodger laddie. V But the Peace it reduc'd me to beg in despair, Till I met my old boy in a Cunningham Fair; His rags regimental they flutter'd so gaudy: My heart it rejoic'd at a sodger laddie. VI And now I have liv'd—I know not how long! But still I can join in a cup and a song; And whilst with both hands I can hold the glass steady, Here's to thee, my hero, my sodger laddie! Sing, lal de dal, etc. RECITATIVO Poor Merry-Andrew in the neuk Sat guzzling wi' a tinkler-hizzie; They mind't na wha the chorus teuk, Between themselves they were sae busy. At length, wi' drink an' courting dizzy, He stoiter'd up an' made a face; Then turn'd an' laid a smack on Grizzie, Syne tun'd his pipes wi' grave grimace:— AIR Tune: Auld Sir Symon I Sir Wisdom's a fool when he's fou; Sir Knave is a fool in a session: He's there but a prentice I trow, But I am a fool by profession. II My grannie she bought me a beuk, An' I held awa to the school: I fear I my talent misteuk, But what will ye hae of a fool? III For drink I wad venture my neck; A hizzie's the half of my craft: But what could ye other expect Of ane that's avowedly daft? IV I ance was tyed up like a stirk For civilly swearing and quaffing; I ance was abus'd i' the kirk For towsing a lass i' my daffin. V Poor Andrew that tumbles for sport Let naebody name wi' a jeer: There's even, I'm tauld, i' the Court A tumbler ca'd the Premier. VI Observ'd ye yon reverend lad Mak faces to tickle the mob? He rails at our mountebank squad— It's rivalship just i' the job! VII And now my conclusion I'll tell, For faith! I'm confoundedly dry: The chiel that's a fool for himsel, Guid Lord! he's far dafter than I. RECITATIVO Then niest outspak a raucle carlin, Wha kent fu' weel to cleek the sterlin, For monie a pursie she had hookèd, An' had in monie a well been doukèd. Her love had been a Highland laddie, But weary fa' the waefu' woodie! Wi' sighs an' sobs she thus began To wail her braw John Highlandman:— AIR Tune: O, An' Ye Were Dead, Guidman I A Highland lad my love was born, The lalland laws he held in scorn, But he still was faithfu' to his clan, My gallant, braw John Highlandman. Chorus Sing hey my braw John Highlandman! Sing ho my braw John Highlandman! There's not a lad in a' the lan' Was match for my John Highlandman! II With his philibeg, an' tartan plaid, An' guid claymore down by his side, The ladies' hearts he did trepan, My gallant, braw John Highlandman. III We rangèd a' from Tweed to Spey, An' liv'd like lords an' ladies gay, For a lalland face he fearèd none, My gallant, braw John Highlandman. IV They banish'd him beyond the sea, But ere the bud was on the tree, Adown my cheeks the pearls ran, Embracing my John Highlandman. V But, Och! they catch'd him at the last, And bound him in a dungeon fast. My curse upon them every one— They've hang'd my braw John Highlandman! VI And now a widow I must mourn The pleasures that will ne'er return; No comfort but a hearty can When I think on John Highlandman. Chorus Sing hey my braw John Highlandman! Sing ho my braw John Highlandman! There's not a lad in a' the lan' Was match for my John Highlandman! RECITATIVO I A pigmy scraper on a fiddle, Wha us'd to trystes an' fairs to driddle, Her strappin limb an' gawsie middle (He reach'd nae higher) Had hol'd his heartie like a riddle, An' blawn't on fire. II Wi' hand on hainch and upward e'e, He croon'd his gamut, one, two, three, Then in an arioso key The wee Apollo Set off wi' allegretto glee His giga solo:— AIR Tune: Whistle Owre the Lave O't I Let me ryke up to dight that tear; An' go wi' me an' be my dear, An' then your every care an' fear May whistle owre the lave o't. Chorus I am a fiddler to my trade, An' a' the tunes that e'er I play'd, The sweetest still to wife or maid Was Whistle Owre the Lave O't. II At kirns an' weddins we 'se be there, An' O, sae nicely's we will fare! We'll bowse about till Daddie Care Sing Whistle Owre the Lave O't. III Sae merrily the banes we'll pyke, An' sun oursels about the dyke; An' at our leisure, when ye like, We'll—whistle owre the lave o't! IV But bless me wi' your heav'n o' charms, An' while I kittle hair on thairms, Hunger, cauld, an' a' sic harms May whistle owre the lave o't. Chorus I am a fiddler to my trade, An' a' the tunes that e'er I play'd, The sweetest still to wife or maid Was Whistle Owre the Lave O't. RECITATIVO I Her charms had struck a sturdy caird As weel as poor gut-scraper; He taks the fiddler by the beard, An' draws a roosty rapier; He swoor by a' was swearing worth To speet him like a pliver, Unless he would from that time forth Relinquish her for ever. II Wi' ghastly e'e poor Tweedle-Dee Upon his hunkers bended, An' pray'd for grace wi' ruefu' face, An' sae the quarrel ended. But tho' his little heart did grieve When round the tinkler prest her, He feign'd to snirtle in his sleeve When thus the caird address'd her:— AIR Tune: Clout the Cauldron I My bonie lass, I work in brass, A tinkler is my station; I've travell'd round all Christian ground In this my occupation; I've taen the gold, an' been enrolled In many a noble squadron; But vain they search'd when off I march'd To go an' clout the cauldron. II Despise that shrimp, that wither'd imp, With a' his noise an' cap'rin, An' take a share wi' those that bear The budget and the apron! And by that stowp, my faith an' houpe! And by that dear Kilbaigie! If e'er ye want, or meet wi' scant, May I ne'er weet my craigie! RECITATIVO I The caird prevail'd: th'unblushing fair In his embraces sunk, Partly wi' love o'ercome sae sair, An' partly she was drunk. Sir Violino, with an air That show'd a man o' spunk, Wish'd unison between the pair, An' made the bottle clunk To their health that night. II But hurchin Cupid shot a shaft, That play'd a dame a shavie: The fiddler rak'd her fore and aft Behint the chicken cavie; Her lord, a wight of Homer's craft, Tho' limpin' wi' the spavie, He hirpl'd up, an' lap like daft, An' shor'd them ‘Dainty Davie’ O' boot that night. III He was a care-defying blade As ever Bacchus listed! Tho' Fortune sair upon him laid, His heart, she ever miss'd it. He had no wish but—to be glad, Nor want but—when he thristed, He hated nought but—to be sad; An' thus the Muse suggested His sang that night. AIR Tune: For A' That, An' A' That I I am a Bard, of no regard Wi' gentle folks an' a' that, But Homer-like the glowrin byke, Frae town to town I draw that. Chorus For a' that, an' a' that, An' twice as muckle's a' that, I've lost but ane, I've twa behin', I've wife eneugh for a' that. II I never drank the Muses' stank, Castalia's burn, an' a' that; But there it streams, an' richly reams— My Helicon I ca' that. III Great love I bear to a' the fair, Their humble slave an' a' that; But lordly will, I hold it still A mortal sin to thraw that. IV In raptures sweet this hour we meet Wi' mutual love an' a' that; But for how lang the flie may stang, Let inclination law that! V Their tricks an' craft hae put me daft, They've taen me in, an' a' that; But clear your decks, an' here's the Sex! I like the jads for a' that. Chorus For a' that, an' a' that, An' twice as muckle's a' that, My dearest bluid, to do them guid, They're welcome till 't for a' that! RECITATIVO So sung the Bard, and Nansie's wa's Shook with a thunder of applause, Re-echo'd from each mouth! They toom'd their pocks, they pawn'd their duds, They scarcely left to coor their fuds, To quench their lowin drouth. Then owre again the jovial thrang The Poet did request To lowse his pack, an' wale a sang, A ballad o' the best: He rising, rejoicing Between his twa Deborahs, Looks round him, an' found them Impatient for the chorus:— AIR Tune: Jolly Mortals, Fill Your Glasses I See the smoking bowl before us! Mark our jovial, ragged ring! Round and round take up the chorus, And in raptures let us sing: Chorus A fig for those by law protected! Liberty's a glorious feast, Courts for cowards were erected, Churches built to please the priest! II What is title, what is treasure, What is reputation's care? If we lead a life of pleasure, 'Tis no matter how or where! III With the ready trick and fable Round we wander all the day; And at night in barn or stable Hug our doxies on the hay. IV Does the train-attended carriage Thro' the country lighter rove? Does the sober bed of marriage Witness brighter scenes of love? V Life is all a variorum, We regard not how it goes; Let them prate about decorum, Who have character to lose. VI Here's to budgets, bags, and wallets! Here's to all the wandering train! Here's our ragged brats and callets! One and all, cry out, Amen! Chorus A fig for those by law protected! Liberty's a glorious feast, Courts for cowards were erected, Churches built to please the priest! SATIRES AND VERSES THE TWA HERDS: OR, THE HOLY TULYIE AN UNCO MOURNFU' TALE Blockheads with reason wicked wits abhor, But fool with fool is barbarous civil war. POPE. I O a' ye pious godly flocks, Weel fed on pastures orthodox, Wha now will keep you frae the fox Or worrying tykes? Or wha will tent the waifs an' crocks About the dykes? II The twa best herds in a' the wast, That e'er gae gospel horn a blast These five an' twenty simmers past— O, dool to tell!— Hae had a bitter, black out-cast Atween themsel. III O Moodie, man, an' wordy Russell, How could you raise so vile a bustle? Ye'll see how New-Light herds will whistle, An' think it fine! The Lord's cause gat na sic a twistle Sin' I hae min'. IV O Sirs! whae'er wad hae expeckit Your duty ye wad sae negleckit? Ye wha were no by lairds respeckit To wear the plaid, But by the brutes themselves eleckit To be their guide! V What flock wi' Moodie's flock could rank, Sae hale an' hearty every shank? Nae poison'd, soor Arminian stank He let them taste; But Calvin's fountainhead they drank— O, sic a feast! VI The thummart, wilcat, brock, an' tod Weel kend his voice thro' a' the wood; He smell'd their ilka hole an' road, Baith out and in; An' weel he lik'd to shed their bluid An' sell their skin. VII What herd like Russell tell'd his tale? His voice was heard thro' muir and dale; He kend the Lord's sheep, ilka tail, O'er a' the height; An' tell'd gin they were sick or hale At the first sight. VIII He fine a mangy sheep could scrub; Or nobly swing the gospel club; Or New-Light herds could nicely drub And pay their skin; Or hing them o'er the burning dub Or heave them in. IX Sic twa—O, do I live to see't?— Sic famous twa sud disagree't, An' names like villain, hypocrite, Ilk ither gi'en, While New-Light herds wi' laughin spite Say neither's liein! X A' ye wha tent the gospel fauld, Thee Duncan deep, an' Peebles shaul', But chiefly great apostle Auld, We trust in thee, That thou wilt work them hot an' cauld Till they agree! XI Consider, sirs, how we're beset: There's scarce a new herd that we get But comes frae 'mang that cursed set I winna name: I hope frae heav'n to see them yet In fiery flame! XII Dalrymple has been lang our fae, M'Gill has wrought us meikle wae, An' that curs'd rascal ca'd M'Quhae, An' baith the Shaws, That aft hae made us black an' blae Wi' vengefu' paws. XIII Auld Wodrow lang has hatch'd mischief: We thought ay death wad bring relief, But he has gotten to our grief Ane to succeed him, A chield wha'll soundly buff our beef— I meikle dread him. XIV An' monie mae that I could tell, Wha fain would openly rebel, Forby turn-coats amang oursel: There's Smith for ane— I doubt he's but a greyneck still, An' that ye'll fin'! XV O a' ye flocks o'er a' the hills, By mosses, meadows, moors, an' fells, Come, join your counsel and your skills To cowe the lairds, An' get the brutes the power themsels To chuse their herds! XVI Then Orthodoxy yet may prance, An' Learning in a woody dance, An' that fell cur ca'd Common-sense, That bites sae sair, Be banish'd o'er the sea to France— Let him bark there! XVII Then Shaw's an' D'rymple's eloquence, M'Gill's close, nervous excellence, M'Quhae's pathetic, manly sense, An' guid M'Math Wha thro' the heart can brawly glance, May a' pack aff! HOLY WILLIE'S PRAYER And send the godly in a pet to pray. POPE. I O Thou that in the Heavens does dwell, Wha, as it pleases best Thysel, Sends ane to Heaven an' ten to Hell A' for Thy glory, And no for onie guid or ill They've done before Thee! II I bless and praise Thy matchless might, When thousands Thou hast left in night, That I am here before Thy sight, For gifts an' grace A burning and a shining light To a' this place. III What was I, or my generation, That I should get sic exaltation? I, wha deserv'd most just damnation For broken laws Sax thousand years ere my creation, Thro' Adam's cause! IV When from my mither's womb I fell, Thou might hae plung'd me deep in hell To gnash my gooms, and weep, and wail In burning lakes, Whare damnèd devils roar and yell, Chain'd to their stakes. V Yet I am here, a chosen sample, To show Thy grace is great and ample: I'm here a pillar o' Thy temple, Strong as a rock, A guide, a buckler, and example To a' Thy flock! VI But yet, O Lord! confess I must: At times I'm fash'd wi' fleshly lust; An' sometimes, too, in warldly trust, Vile self gets in; But Thou remembers we are dust, Defiled wi' sin. VII O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wi' Meg— Thy pardon I sincerely beg— O, may't ne'er be a living plague To my dishonour! An' I'll ne'er lift a lawless leg Again upon her. VIII Besides, I farther maun avow— Wi' Leezie's lass, three times, I trow— But, Lord, that Friday I was fou, When I cam near her, Or else, Thou kens, Thy servant true Wad never steer her. IX Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn Buffet Thy servant e'en and morn, Lest he owre proud and high should turn That he's sae gifted: If sae, Thy han' maun e'en be borne Until Thou lift it. X Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place, For here Thou has a chosen race! But God confound their stubborn face An' blast their name, Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace An' open shame! XI Lord, mind Gau'n Hamilton's deserts: He drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes, Yet has sae monie takin arts Wi' great and sma', Frae God's ain Priest the people's hearts He steals awa. XII And when we chasten'd him therefore, Thou kens how he bred sic a splore, And set the warld in a roar O' laughin at us: Curse Thou his basket and his store, Kail an' potatoes! XIII Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r Against that Presbyt'ry of Ayr! Thy strong right hand, Lord, mak it bare Upo' their heads! Lord, visit them, an' dinna spare, For their misdeeds! XIV O Lord, my God! that glib-tongu'd Aiken, My vera heart and flesh are quakin To think how we stood sweatin, shakin, An' pish'd wi' dread, While he, wi' hingin lip an' snakin, Held up his head. XV Lord, in Thy day o' vengeance try him! Lord, visit him wha did employ him! And pass not in Thy mercy by them, Nor hear their pray'r, But for Thy people's sake destroy them, An' dinna spare! XVI But, Lord, remember me and mine Wi' mercies temporal and divine, That I for grace an' gear may shine Excell'd by nane; And a' the glory shall be Thine— Amen, Amen! THE KIRK'S ALARM I Orthodox! orthodox!— Wha believe in John Knox— Let me sound an alarm to your conscience: A heretic blast Has been blawn i' the Wast, That what is not sense must be nonsense— Orthodox! That what is not sense must be nonsense. II Dr. Mac! Dr. Mac! You should stretch on a rack, To strike wicked Writers wi' terror: To join faith and sense, Upon onie pretence, Was heretic, damnable error— Dr. Mac! 'Twas heretic, damnable error. III Town of Ayr! Town of Ayr! It was rash, I declare, To meddle wi' mischief a-brewing: Provost John is still deaf To the church's relief, And Orator Bob is its ruin— Town of Ayr! And Orator Bob is its ruin. IV D'rymple mild! D'rymple mild! Tho' your heart's like a child, An' your life like the new-driven snaw, Yet that winna save ye: Auld Satan must have ye, For preaching that three's ane and twa— D'rymple mild! For preaching that three's ane and twa. V Calvin's sons! Calvin's sons! Seize your sp'ritual guns, Ammunition you never can need: Your hearts are the stuff Will be powther enough, And your skulls are store-houses o' lead— Calvin's sons! Your skulls are store-houses o' lead. VI Rumble John! Rumble John! Mount the steps with a groan, Cry:—‘The book is wi' heresy cramm'd’; Then lug out your ladle, Deal brimstone like adle, And roar every note o' the damn'd— Rumble John! And roar every note o' the damn'd. VII Simper James! Simper James! Leave the fair Killie dames— There's a holier chase in your view: I'll lay on your head That the pack ye'll soon lead, For puppies like you there's but few— Simper James! For puppies like you there's but few. VIII Singet Sawnie! Singet Sawnie! Are ye herding the penny, Unconscious what evils await? Wi' a jump, yell, and howl Alarm every soul, For the Foul Thief is just at your gate— Singet Sawnie! The Foul Thief is just at your gate. IX Daddie Auld! Daddie Auld! There's a tod in the fauld, A tod meikle waur than the clerk: Tho' ye can do little skaith, Ye'll be in at the death, And gif ye canna bite, ye may bark— Daddie Auld! For gif ye canna bite ye may bark. X Davie Rant! Davie Rant! In a face like a saunt And a heart that would poison a hog, Raise an impudent roar, Like a breaker lee-shore, Or the Kirk will be tint in a bog— Davie Rant! Or the Kirk will be tint in a bog. XI Jamie Goose! Jamie Goose! Ye hae made but toom roose In hunting the wicked lieutenant; But the Doctor's your mark, For the Lord's haly ark, He has cooper'd, and ca'd a wrang pin in't— Jamie Goose! He has cooper'd and ca'd a wrang pin in't. XII Poet Willie! Poet Willie! Gie the Doctor a volley, Wi' your ‘Liberty's chain’ and your wit: O'er Pegasus' side Ye ne'er laid a stride, Ye but smelt, man, the place where he shit— Poet Willie! Ye smelt but the place where he shit. XIII Andro' Gowk! Andro Gowk! Ye may slander the Book, And the Book not the waur, let me tell ye: Ye are rich, and look big, But lay by hat and wig, And ye'll hae a calf's head o' sma' value— Andro Gowk! Ye'll hae a calf's head o' sma' value. XIV Barr Steenie! Barr Steenie! What mean ye? what mean ye? If ye'll meddle nae mair wi' the matter, Ye may hae some pretence To havins and sense Wi' people wha ken ye nae better— Barr Steenie! Wi' people wha ken ye nae better. XV Irvine-side! Irvine-side! Wi' your turkey-cock pride, Of manhood but sma' is your share: Ye've the figure, 'tis true, Even your faes will allow, And your friends daurna say ye hae mair— Irvine-side! Your friends daurna say ye hae mair. XVI Muirland Jock! Muirland Jock! Whom the Lord gave a stock Wad set up a tinkler in brass, If ill manners were wit, There's no mortal so fit To prove the poor Doctor an ass— Muirland Jock! To prove the poor Doctor an ass. XVII Holy Will! Holy Will! There was wit i' your skull, When ye pilfer'd the alms o' the poor: The timmer is scant, When ye're taen for a saunt Wha should swing in a rape for an hour— Holy Will! Ye should swing in a rape for an hour. XVIII Poet Burns! Poet Burns! Wi' your priest-skelping turns, Why desert ye your auld native shire? Your Muse is a gipsy, Yet were she ev'n tipsy, She could ca' us nae waur than we are— Poet Burns! Ye could ca' us nae waur than we are. POSTSCRIPTS 1 Afton's Laird! Afton's Laird! When your pen can be spared, A copy of this I bequeath, On the same sicker score As I mention'd before, To that trusty auld worthy, Clackleith— Afton's Laird! To that trusty auld worthy, Clackleith. 2 Factor John! Factor John! Whom the Lord made alone, And ne'er made another thy peer, Thy poor servant, the Bard, In respectful regard He presents thee this token sincere— Factor John! He presents thee this token sincere. A POET'S WELCOME TO HIS LOVE-BEGOTTEN DAUGHTER THE FIRST INSTANCE THAT ENTITLED HIM TO THE VENERABLE APPELLATION OF FATHER I Thou's welcome, wean! Mishanter fa' me, If thoughts o' thee or yet thy mammie Shall ever daunton me or awe me, My sweet, wee lady, Or if I blush when thou shalt ca' me Tyta or daddie! II What tho' they ca' me fornicator, An' tease my name in kintra clatter? The mair they talk, I'm kend the better; E'en let them clash! An auld wife's tongue's a feckless matter To gie ane fash. III Welcome, my bonie, sweet, wee dochter! Tho' ye come here a wee unsought for, And tho' your comin I hae fought for Baith kirk and queir; Yet, by my faith, ye're no unwrought for— That I shall swear! IV Sweet fruit o' monie a merry dint, My funny toil is no a' tint: Tho' thou cam to the warl' asklent, Which fools may scoff at, In my last plack thy part's be in't The better half o't. V Tho' I should be the waur bestead, Thou's be as braw and bienly clad, And thy young years as nicely bred Wi' education, As onie brat o' wedlock's bed In a' thy station. VI Wee image o' my bonie Betty, As fatherly I kiss and daut thee, As dear and near my heart I set thee, Wi' as guid will, As a' the priests had seen me get thee That's out o' Hell. VII Gude grant that thou may ay inherit Thy mither's looks an' gracefu' merit, An' thy poor, worthless daddie's spirit Without his failins! 'Twill please me mair to see thee heir it Than stocket mailins. VIII And if thou be what I wad hae thee, An' tak the counsel I shall gie thee, I'll never rue my trouble wi' thee— The cost nor shame o't— But be a loving father to thee, And brag the name o't. THE INVENTORY IN ANSWER TO A MANDATE BY THE SURVEYOR OF TAXES Sir, as your mandate did request, I send you here a faithfu' list O' guids an' gear an' a' my graith, To which I'm clear to gie my aith. Imprimis, then, for carriage cattle:— I hae four brutes o' gallant mettle As ever drew before a pettle: My lan'-afore's a guid auld ‘has been,’ An' wight an' wilfu' a' his days been. My lan'-ahin's a weel-gaun fillie, That aft has borne me hame frae Killie, An' your auld borough monie a time In days when riding was nae crime. (But ance, when in my wooing pride I, like a blockhead, boost to ride, The wilfu' creature sae I pat to— Lord, pardon a' my sins, an' that too!— I play'd my fillie sic a shavie, She's a' bedevil'd wi' the spavie.) My fur-ahin's a wordy beast As e'er in tug or tow was traced. The fourth's a Highland Donald hastie, A damn'd red-wud Kilburnie blastie! Foreby, a cowte, o' cowtes the wale, As ever ran afore a tail: If he be spar'd to be a beast, He'll draw me fifteen pund at least. Wheel-carriages I hae but few: Three carts, an' twa are feckly new; An auld wheelbarrow—mair for token, Ae leg an' baith the trams are broken: I made a poker o' the spin'le, An' my auld mither brunt the trin'le. For men, I've three mischíevous boys, Run-deils for fechtin an' for noise: A gaudsman ane, a thrasher t'other, Wee Davoc hauds the nowte in fother. I rule them, as I ought, discreetly, An' aften labour them completely; An' ay on Sundays duly, nightly, I on the Questions tairge them tightly: Till, faith! wee Davoc's grown sae gleg, Tho' scarcely langer than your leg, He'll screed you aff ‘Effectual Calling’ As fast as onie in the dwalling. I've nane in female servan' station (Lord keep me ay frae a' temptation!): I hae nae wife—and that my bliss is— An' ye hae laid nae tax on misses; An' then, if kirk folks dinna clutch me, I ken the deevils darena touch me. Wi' weans I'm mair than weel contented: Heav'n sent me ane mair than I wanted! My sonsie, smirking, dear-bought Bess, She stares the daddie in her face, Enough of ought ye like but grace: But her, my bonie, sweet wee lady, I've paid enough for her already; An' gin ye tax her or her mither, By the Lord, ye 'se get them a' thegither! But pray, remember, Mr. Aiken, Nae kind of licence out I'm takin: Frae this time forth, I do declare I'se ne'er ride horse nor hizzie mair; Thro' dirt and dub for life I'll paidle, Ere I sae dear pay for a saddle; I've sturdy stumps, the Lord be thankit, And a' my gates on foot I'll shank it. The Kirk and you may tak' you that, It puts but little in your pat: Sae dinna put me in your beuk, Nor for my ten white shillings leuk. This list, wi' my ain hand I've wrote it, The day and date as under notit; Then know all ye whom it concerns, Subscripsi huic, Robert Burns. A MAUCHLINE WEDDING I When Eighty-five was seven months auld And wearing thro' the aught, When rolling rains and Boreas bauld Gied farmer-folks a faught; Ae morning quondam Mason W? Now Merchant Master Miller, Gaed down to meet wi' Nansie B? And her Jamaica siller To wed, that day. II The rising sun o'er Blacksideen Was just appearing fairly, When Nell and Bess got up to dress Seven lang half-hours o'er early! Now presses clink, and drawers jink, For linens and for laces: But modest Muses only think What ladies' underdress is On sic a day! III But we'll suppose the stays are lac'd, And bonie bosoms steekit, Tho' thro' the lawn—but guess the rest! An angel scarce durst keek it. Then stockins fine o' silken twine Wi' cannie care are drawn up; An' garten'd tight whare mortal wight— As I never wrote it down my recollection does not entirely serve me. IV But now the gown wi' rustling sound Its silken pomp displays; Sure there's nae sin in being vain O' siccan bonie claes! Sae jimp the waist, the tail sae vast— Trouth, they were bonie birdies! O Mither Eve, ye wad been grieve To see their ample hurdies Sae large that day! V Then Sandy, wi's red jacket braw, Comes whip-jee-woa! about, And in he gets the bonie twa— Lord, send them safely out! And auld John Trot wi' sober phiz, As braid and braw's a Bailie, His shouthers and his Sunday's jiz Wi' powther and wi' ulzie Weel smear'd that day.... ADAM ARMOUR'S PRAYER I Gude pity me, because I'm little! For though I am an elf o' mettle, And can like onie wabster's shuttle Jink there or here, Yet, scarce as lang's a guid kail-whittle, I'm unco queer. II An' now Thou kens our woefu' case: For Geordie's jurr we're in disgrace, Because we stang'd her through the place, An' hurt her spleuchan; For whilk we daurna show our face Within the clachan. III An' now we're dern'd in dens and hollows, And hunted, as was William Wallace, Wi' constables—thae blackguard fallows— An' sodgers baith; But Gude preserve us frae the gallows, That shamefu' death! IV Auld, grim, black-bearded Geordie's sel'— O, shake him owre the mouth o' Hell! There let him hing, an' roar, an' yell Wi' hideous din, And if he offers to rebel, Then heave him in! V When Death comes in wi' glimmerin blink, An' tips auld drucken Nanse the wink, May Sautan gie her doup a clink Within his yett, An' fill her up wi' brimstone drink Red-reekin het. VI Though Jock an' hav'rel Jean are merry, Some devil seize them in a hurry, An' waft them in th'infernal wherry Straught through the lake, An' gie their hides a noble curry Wi' oil of aik! VII As for the jurr—puir worthless body!— She's got mischief enough already; Wi' stanget hips and buttocks bluidy She's suffer'd sair; But may she wintle in a woody If she whore mair! NATURE'S LAW HUMBLY INSCRIBED TO GAVIN HAMILTON, ESQUIRE Great Nature spoke, observant man obeyed. POPE. I Let other heroes boast their scars, The marks o' sturt and strife, But other poets sing of wars, The plagues o' human life! Shame fa' the fun: wi' sword and gun To slap mankind like lumber! I sing his name and nobler fame Wha multiplies our number. II Great Nature spoke, with air benign:— ‘Go on, ye human race; This lower world I you resign; Be fruitful and increase. The liquid fire of strong desire, I've poured it in each bosom; Here on this hand does Mankind stand. And there, is Beauty's blossom!’ III The Hero of these artless strains, A lowly Bard was he, Who sung his rhymes in Coila's plains With meikle mirth and glee: Kind Nature's care had given his share Large of the flaming current; And, all devout, he never sought To stem the sacred torrent. IV He felt the powerful, high behest Thrill vital thro' and thro'; And sought a correspondent breast To give obedience due. Propitious Powers screen'd the young flow'rs From mildews of abortion; And lo! the Bard—a great reward— Has got a double portion! V Auld cantie Coil may count the day, As annual it returns, The third of Libra's equal sway, That gave another Burns, With future rhymes an' other times To emulate his sire, To sing auld Coil in nobler style With more poetic fire! VI Ye Powers of peace and peaceful song, Look down with gracious eyes, And bless auld Coila large and long With multiplying joys! Lang may she stand to prop the land, The flow'r of ancient nations, And Burnses spring her fame to sing To endless generations! LINES ON MEETING WITH LORD DAER I This wot ye all whom it concerns: I, Rhymer Rab, alias Burns, October twenty-third, A ne'er-to-be-forgotten day, Sae far I sprachl'd up the brae I dinner'd wi' a Lord. II I've been at drucken Writers' feasts, Nay, been bitch-fou 'mang godly Priests— Wi' rev'rence be it spoken!— I've even join'd the honor'd jorum, When mighty Squireships o' the Quorum Their hydra drouth did sloken. III But wi' a Lord!—stand out my shin! A Lord, a Peer, an Earl's son!— Up higher yet, my bonnet! An' sic a Lord!—lang Scotch ell twa Our Peerage he looks o'er them a', As I look o'er my sonnet. IV But O, for Hogarth's magic pow'r To show Sir Bardie's willyart glow'r, An' how he star'd an' stammer'd, When, goavin's he'd been led wi' branks, An' stumpin on his ploughman shanks, He in the parlour hammer'd! V To meet good Stewart little pain is, Or Scotia's sacred Demosthénes: Thinks I: ‘They are but men’! But ‘Burns’!—‘My Lord’!—Good God! I doited, My knees on ane anither knoited As faultering I gaed ben. VI I sidling shelter'd in a neuk, An' at his Lordship staw a leuk, Like some portentous omen: Except good sense and social glee An' (what surpris'd me) modesty, I markèd nought uncommon. VII I watch'd the symptoms o' the Great— The gentle pride, the lordly state, The arrogant assuming: The fient a pride, nae pride had he, Nor sauce, nor state, that I could see, Mair than an honest ploughman! VIII Then from his Lordship I shall learn Henceforth to meet with unconcern One rank as well's another; Nae honest, worthy man need care To meet with noble youthfu' Daer, For he but meets a brother. ADDRESS TO THE TOOTHACHE I My curse upon your venom'd stang, That shoots my tortur'd gooms alang, An' thro' my lug gies monie a twang Wi' gnawing vengeance, Tearing my nerves wi' bitter pang, Like racking engines! II A' down my beard the slavers trickle, I throw the wee stools o'er the mickle, While round the fire the giglets keckle To see me loup, An', raving mad, I wish a heckle Were i' their doup! III When fevers burn, or ague freezes, Rheumatics gnaw, or colic squeezes, Our neebors sympathise to ease us Wi' pitying moan; But thee!—thou hell o' a' diseases, They mock our groan! IV Of a' the num'rous human dools— Ill-hairsts, daft bargains, cutty-stools, Or worthy frien's laid i' the mools, Sad sight to see! The tricks o' knaves, or fash o' fools— Thou bear'st the gree! V Whare'er that place be priests ca' Hell, Whare a' the tones o' misery yell, An' rankèd plagues their numbers tell In dreadfu' raw, Thou, Toothache, surely bear'st the bell Amang them a'! VI O thou grim, mischief-making chiel, That gars the notes o' discord squeel Till humankind aft dance a reel In gore a shoe-thick, Gie a' the faes o' Scotland's weal A towmond's toothache. LAMENT FOR THE ABSENCE OF WILLIAM CREECH, PUBLISHER I Auld chuckie Reekie's sair distrest, Down droops her ance weel burnish'd crest, Nae joy her bonie buskit nest Can yield ava: Her darling bird that she lo'es best, Willie,'s awa. II O, Willie was a witty wight, And had o' things an unco sleight! Auld Reekie ay he keepit tight And trig an' braw; But now they'll busk her like a fright— Willie's awa! III The stiffest o' them a' he bow'd; The bauldest o' them a' he cow'd; They durst nae mair than he allow'd— That was a law: We've lost a birkie weel worth gowd— Willie's awa! IV Now gawkies, tawpies, gowks, and fools Frae colleges and boarding schools May sprout like simmer puddock-stools In glen or shaw: He wha could brush them down to mools, Willie,'s awa! V The brethren o' the Commerce-Chaumer May mourn their loss wi' doolfu' clamour: He was a dictionar and grammar Amang them a'. I fear they'll now mak monie a stammer: Willie's awa! VI Nae mair we see his levee door Philosophers and Poets pour, And toothy Critics by the score In bloody raw: The adjutant of a' the core, Willie,'s awa! VII Now worthy Greg'ry's Latin face, Tytler's and Greenfield's modest grace, M'Kenzie, Stewart, such a brace As Rome ne'er saw, They a' maun meet some ither place— Willie's awa! VIII Poor Burns ev'n ‘Scotch Drink’ canna quicken: He cheeps like some bewilder'd chicken Scar'd frae its minnie and the cleckin By hoodie-craw. Grief's gien his heart an unco kickin— Willie's awa! IX Now ev'ry sour-mou'd, girnin blellum, And Calvin's folk, are fit to fell him; Ilk self-conceited critic-skellum His quill may draw: He wha could brawlie ward their bellum, Willie,'s awa! X Up wimpling, stately Tweed I've sped, And Eden scenes on crystal Jed, And Ettrick banks, now roaring red While tempests blaw; But every joy and pleasure's fled: Willie's awa! XI May I be Slander's common speech, A text for Infamy to preach, And, lastly, streekit out to bleach In winter snaw, When I forget thee, Willie Creech, Tho' far awa! XII May never wicked Fortune touzle him, May never wicked men bamboozle him, Until a pow as auld's Methusalem He canty claw! Then to the blessed new Jerusalem Fleet-wing awa! VERSES IN FRIARS CARSE HERMITAGE Thou whom chance may hither lead, Be thou clad in russet weed, Be thou deckt in silken stole, Grave these maxims on thy soul: Life is but a day at most, Sprung from night in darkness lost; Hope not sunshine every hour, Fear not clouds will always lour. Happiness is but a name, Make content and ease thy aim. Ambition is a meteor-gleam; Fame a restless airy dream; Pleasures, insects on the wing Round Peace, th'tend'rest flow'r of spring; Those that sip the dew alone— Make the butterflies thy own; Those that would the bloom devour— Crush the locusts, save the flower. For the future be prepar'd: Guard wherever thou can'st guard; But, thy utmost duly done, Welcome what thou can'st not shun. Follies past give thou to air— Make their consequence thy care. Keep the name of Man in mind, And dishonour not thy kind. Reverence with lowly heart Him, whose wondrous work thou art; Keep His Goodness still in view— Thy trust, and thy example too. Stranger, go! Heaven be thy guide! Quod the Beadsman on Nidside. ELEGY ON THE DEPARTED YEAR 1788 For lords or kings I dinna mourn; E'en let them die—for that they're born; But O, prodigious to reflect, A Towmont, sirs, is gane to wreck! O Eighty-Eight, in thy sma' space What dire events hae taken place! Of what enjoyments thou hast reft us! In what a pickle thou hast left us! The Spanish empire's tint a head, An' my auld teethless Bawtie's dead; The tulyie's teugh 'tween Pitt and Fox, An' our guidwife's wee birdie cocks: The tane is game, a bluidie devil, But to the hen-birds unco civil; The tither's dour—has nae sic breedin, But better stuff ne'er claw'd a midden. Ye ministers, come mount the poupit, An' cry till ye be haerse an' roupet, For Eighty-Eight, he wished you weel, An' gied ye a' baith gear an' meal: E'en monie a plack and monie a peck, Ye ken yoursels, for little feck! Ye bonie lasses, dight your een, For some o' you hae tint a frien': In Eighty-Eight, ye ken, was taen What ye'll ne'er hae to gie again. Observe the vera nowte an' sheep, How dowff an' dowilie they creep! Nay, even the yirth itsel does cry, For Embro' wells are grutten dry! O Eighty-Nine, thou's but a bairn, An' no owre auld, I hope, to learn! Thou beardless boy, I pray tak care, Thou now has got thy Daddie's chair: Nae hand-cuff'd, mizzl'd, half-shackl'd Regent, But, like himsel, a full free agent, Be sure ye follow out the plan Nae waur than he did, honest man! As muckle better as ye can. January 1, 1789. CASTLE GORDON I Streams that glide in Orient plains, Never bound by Winter's chains; Glowing here on golden sands, There immixed with foulest stains From tyranny's empurpled hands; These, their richly gleaming waves, I leave to tyrants and their slaves: Give me the stream that sweetly laves The banks by Castle Gordon. II Spicy forests ever gay, Shading from the burning ray Hapless wretches sold to toil; Or, the ruthless native's way, Bent on slaughter, blood and spoil; Woods that ever verdant wave, I leave the tyrant and the slave: Give me the groves that lofty brave The storms of Castle Gordon. III Wildly here without control Nature reigns, and rules the whole; In that sober pensive mood, Dearest to the feeling soul, She plants the forest, pours the flood. Life's poor day I'll, musing, rave, And find at night a sheltering cave, Where waters flow and wild woods wave By bonie Castle Gordon. ON THE DUCHESS OF GORDON'S REEL DANCING I She kiltit up her kirtle weel To show her bonie cutes sae sma', And wallopèd about the reel, The lightest louper o' them a'! II While some, like slav'ring, doited stots Stoit'ring out thro' the midden dub, Fankit their heels amang their coats And gart the floor their backsides rub; III Gordon, the great, the gay, the gallant, Skip't like a maukin owre a dyke: Deil tak me, since I was a callant, Gif e'er my een beheld the like! ON CAPTAIN GROSE WRITTEN ON AN ENVELOPE, ENCLOSING A LETTER TO HIM I Ken ye ought o' Captain Grose? Igo and ago If he's among his friends or foes? Iram, coram, dago II Is he south, or is he north? Igo and ago Or drownèd in the River Forth? Iram, coram, dago III Is he slain by Hielan' bodies? Igo and ago And eaten like a wether haggis? Iram, coram, dago IV Is he to Abra'm's bosom gane? Igo and ago Or haudin Sarah by the wame? Iram, coram, dago V Where'er he be, the Lord be near him! Igo and ago As for the Deil, he daur na steer him. Iram, coram, dago VI But please transmit th'enclosèd letter Igo and ago Which will oblige your humble debtor Iram, coram, dago VII So may ye hae auld stanes in store, Igo and ago The very stanes that Adam bore! Iram, coram, dago VIII So may ye get in glad possession, Igo and ago The coins o' Satan's coronation! Iram, coram, dago NEW YEAR'S DAY 1791 This day Time winds th'exhausted chain, To run the twelvemonth's length again: I see the old, bald-pated fellow, With ardent eyes, complexion sallow, Adjust the unimpair'd machine To wheel the equal, dull routine. The absent lover, minor heir, In vain assail him with their prayer: Deaf as my friend, he sees them press, Nor makes the hour one moment less. Will you (the Major's with the hounds; The happy tenants share his rounds; Coila's fair Rachel's care to-day, And blooming Keith's engaged with Gray) From housewife cares a minute borrow (That grandchild's cap will do to-morrow), And join with me a-moralizing? This day's propitious to be wise in! First, what did yesternight deliver? ‘Another year has gone for ever.’ And what is this day's strong suggestion? ‘The passing moment's all we rest on!’ Rest on—for what? what do we here? Or why regard the passing year? Will Time, amus'd with proverb'd lore, Add to our date one minute more? A few days may—a few years must— Repose us in the silent dust: Then, is it wise to damp our bliss? Yes: all such reasonings are amiss! The voice of Nature loudly cries, And many a message from the skies, That something in us never dies; That on this frail, uncertain state Hang matters of eternal weight; That future life in worlds unknown Must take its hue from this alone, Whether as heavenly glory bright Or dark as Misery's woeful night. Since, then, my honor'd first of friends, On this poor being all depends, Let us th'important Now employ, And live as those who never die. Tho' you, with days and honours crown'd, Witness that filial circle round (A sight life's sorrows to repulse, A sight pale Envy to convulse), Others now claim your chief regard: Yourself, you wait your bright reward. FROM ESOPUS TO MARIA From those drear solitudes and frowsy cells, Where Infamy with sad Repentance dwells; Where turnkeys make the jealous portal fast, And deal from iron hands the spare repast; Where truant 'prentices, yet young in sin, Blush at the curious stranger peeping in; Where strumpets, relics of the drunken roar, Resolve to drink, nay half—to whore—no more; Where tiny thieves, not destin'd yet to swing, Beat hemp for others riper for the string: From these dire scenes my wretched lines I date. To tell Maria her Esopus' fate. ‘Alas! I feel I am no actor here!’ 'Tis real hangmen real scourges bear! Prepare, Maria, for a horrid tale Will turn thy very rouge to deadly pale; Will make thy hair, tho' erst from gipsy poll'd, By barber woven and by barber sold, Though twisted smooth with Harry's nicest care, Like hoary bristles to erect and stare! The hero of the mimic scene, no more I start in Hamlet, in Othello roar; Or, haughty Chieftain, 'mid the din of arms, In Highland bonnet woo Malvina's charms: While sans-culottes stoop up the mountain high, And steal me from Maria's prying eye. Blest Highland bonnet! once my proudest dress, Now, prouder still, Maria's temples press! I see her wave thy towering plumes afar, And call each coxcomb to the wordy war! I see her face the first of Ireland's sons, And even out-Irish his Hibernian bronze! The crafty Colonel leaves the tartan'd lines For other wars, where he a hero shines; The hopeful youth, in Scottish senate bred, Who owns a Bushby's heart without the head, Comes 'mid a string of coxcombs to display That Veni, vidi, vici, is his way; The shrinking Bard adown the alley skulks, And dreads a meeting worse than Woolwich hulks, Though there his heresies in Church and State Might well award him Muir and Palmer's fate: Still she, undaunted, reels and rattles on, And dares the public like a noontide sun. What scandal called Maria's jaunty stagger The ricket reeling of a crooked swagger? Whose spleen (e'en worse than Burns's venom, when He dips in gall unmix'd his eager pen, And pours his vengeance in the burning line), Who christen'd thus Maria's lyre-divine, The idiot strum of Vanity bemus'd, And even th'abuse of Poesy abus'd? Who called her verse a Parish Workhouse, made For motley foundling Fancies, stolen or strayed? A Workhouse! Ah, that sound awakes my woes, And pillows on the thorn my rack'd repose! In durance vile here must I wake and weep, And all my frowsy couch in sorrow steep: That straw where many a rogue has lain of yore, And vermin'd gipsies litter'd heretofore. Why, Lonsdale, thus thy wrath on vagrants pour? Must earth no rascal save thyself endure? Must thou alone in guilt immortal swell, And make a vast monopoly of Hell? Thou know'st the Virtues cannot hate thee worse: The Vices also, must they club their curse? Or must no tiny sin to others fall, Because thy guilt's supreme enough for all? Maria, send me too thy griefs and cares, In all of thee sure thy Esopus shares: As thou at all mankind the flag unfurls, Who on my fair one Satire's vengeance hurls! Who calls thee, pert, affected, vain coquette, A wit in folly, and a fool in wit! Who says that fool alone is not thy due, And quotes thy treacheries to prove it true! Our force united on thy foes we'll turn, And dare the war with all of woman born: For who can write and speak as thou and I? My periods that decyphering defy, And thy still matchless tongue that conquers all reply! NOTES AND EPISTLES TO JOHN RANKINE IN REPLY TO AN ANNOUNCEMENT I I am a keeper of the law In some sma' points, altho' not a'; Some people tell me, gin I fa' Ae way or ither, The breaking of ae point, tho' sma', Breaks a' thegither. II I hae been in for 't ance or twice, And winna say o'er far for thrice, Yet never met wi' that surprise That broke my rest. But now a rumour's like to rise— A whaup's i' the nest! TO JOHN GOLDIE AUGUST 1785 I O Goudie, terror o' the Whigs, Dread o' black coats and rev'rend wigs! Sour Bigotry on her last legs Girns and looks back, Wishing the ten Egyptian plagues May seize you quick. II Poor gapin, glowrin Superstition! Wae's me, she's in a sad condition! Fye! bring Black Jock, her state physician, To see her water! Alas! there's ground for great suspicion She'll ne'er get better. III Enthusiasm's past redemption Gane in a gallopin consumption: Not a' her quacks wi' a' their gumption Can ever mend her; Her feeble pulse gies strong presumption She'll soon surrender. IV Auld Orthodoxy lang did grapple For every hole to get a stapple; But now she fetches at the thrapple, An' fights for breath: Haste, gie her name up in the chapel, Near unto death! V 'Tis you an' Taylor are the chief To blame for a' this black mischief; But, gin the Lord's ain folk gat leave, A toom tar barrel An' twa red peats wad bring relief, And end the quarrel. VI For me, my skill's but very sma', An' skill in prose I've nane ava'; But, quietlenswise between us twa, Weel may ye speed! And, tho' they sud you sair misca', Ne'er fash your head! VII E'en swinge the dogs, and thresh them sicker! The mair they squeel ay chap the thicker, And still 'mang hands a hearty bicker O' something stout! It gars an owthor's pulse beat quicker, An' helps his wit. VIII There's naething like the honest nappy: Whare'll ye e'er see men sae happy, Or women sonsie, saft, and sappy 'Tween morn and morn, As them wha like to taste the drappie In glass or horn? IX I've seen me daez't upon a time, I scarce could wink or see a styme; Just ae hauf-mutchkin does me prime (Ought less is little); Then back I rattle on the rhyme As gleg's a whittle. TO J. LAPRAIK (THIRD EPISTLE) I Guid speed and furder to you, Johnie, Guid health, hale han's, an' weather bonie! Now, when ye're nickin down fu' cannie The staff o' bread, May ye ne'er want a stoup o' bran'y To clear your head! II May Boreas never thresh your rigs, Nor kick your rickles aff their legs, Sendin the stuff o'er muirs an' haggs Like drivin wrack! But may the tapmost grain that wags Come to the sack! III I'm bizzie, too, an' skelpin at it; But bitter, daudin showers hae wat it; Sae my auld stumpie-pen, I gat it, Wi' muckle wark, An' took my jocteleg, an' whatt it Like onie clark. IV It's now twa month that I'm your debtor For your braw, nameless, dateless letter, Abusin me for harsh ill-nature On holy men, While deil a hair yoursel ye're better, But mair profane! V But let the kirk-folk ring their bells! Let's sing about our noble sel's: We'll cry nae jads frae heathen hills To help or roose us, But browster wives an' whisky stills— They are the Muses! VI Your friendship, sir, I winna quat it; An' if ye mak' objections at it, Then hand in nieve some day we'll knot it, An' witness take; An', when wi' usquabae we've wat it, It winna break. VII But if the beast and branks be spar'd Till kye be gaun without the herd, And a' the vittel in the yard An' theckit right, I mean your ingle-side to guard Ae winter night. VIII Then Muse-inspirin aqua-vitæ Shall mak us baith sae blythe an' witty, Till ye forget ye're auld an' gatty, And be as canty As ye were nine year less than thretty— Sweet ane an' twenty! IX But stooks are cowpet wi' the blast, And now the sinn keeks in the wast; Then I maun rin amang the rest, An' quat my chanter; Sae I subscribe mysel in haste, Yours, Rab the Ranter. Sept. 13, 1785 TO THE REV. JOHN M'MATH INCLOSING A COPY OF HOLY WILLIE'S PRAYER WHICH HE HAD REQUESTED, SEPT. 17, 1785 I While at the stook the shearers cow'r To shun the bitter blaudin show'r, Or, in gulravage rinnin, scowr: To pass the time, To you I dedicate the hour In idle rhyme. II My Musie, tir'd wi' monie a sonnet On gown an' ban' an' douse black-bonnet, Is grown right eerie now she's done it, Lest they should blame her, An' rouse their holy thunder on it, And anathém her. III I own 'twas rash, an' rather hardy, That I, a simple, countra Bardie, Should meddle wi' a pack sae sturdy, Wha, if they ken me, Can easy wi' a single wordie Louse Hell upon me. IV But I gae mad at their grimaces, Their sighin, cantin, grace-proud faces, Their three-mile prayers an' hauf-mile graces, Their raxin conscience, Whase greed, revenge, an' pride disgraces Waur nor their nonsense. V There's Gau'n, misca'd waur than a beast, Wha has mair honor in his breast Than monie scores as guid's the priest Wha sae abus't him: And may a Bard no crack his jest What way they've use't him? VI See him, the poor man's friend in need, The gentleman in word an' deed— An' shall his fame an' honor bleed By worthless skellums, An' not a Muse erect her head To cowe the blellums? VII O Pope, had I thy satire's darts To gie the rascals their deserts, I'd rip their rotten, hollow hearts, An' tell aloud Their jugglin, hocus-pocus arts To cheat the crowd! VIII God knows, I'm no the thing I should be, Nor am I even the thing I could be, But twenty times I rather would be An atheist clean Than under gospel colors hid be Just for a screen. IX An honest man may like a glass, An honest man may like a lass; But mean revenge an' malice fause He'll still disdain An' then cry zeal for gospel laws Like some we ken. X They take Religion in their mouth, They talk o' Mercy, Grace, an' Truth: For what? To gie their malice skouth On some puir wight; An' hunt him down, o'er right an' ruth, To ruin streight. XI All hail, Religion! Maid divine, Pardon a Muse sae mean as mine, Who in her rough imperfect line Thus daurs to name thee To stigmatise false friends of thine Can ne'er defame thee. XII Tho' blotch't and foul wi' monie a stain An' far unworthy of thy train, With trembling voice I tune my strain To join with those Who boldly dare thy cause maintain In spite of foes: XIII In spite o' crowds, in spite o' mobs, In spite of undermining jobs, In spite o' dark banditti stabs At worth an' merit, By scoundrels, even wi' holy robes But hellish spirit! XIV O Ayr! my dear, my native ground, Within thy presbyterial bound A candid lib'ral band is found Of public teachers, As men, as Christians too, renown'd, An' manly preachers. XV Sir, in that circle you are nam'd; Sir, in that circle you are fam'd; An' some, by whom your doctrine's blam'd (Which gies ye honor), Even, Sir, by them your heart's esteem'd, An' winning manner. XVI Pardon this freedom I have taen, An' if impertinent I've been, Impute it not, good sir, in ane Whase heart ne'er wrang'd ye, But to his utmost would befriend Ought that belang'd ye. TO DAVIE SECOND EPISTLE Auld Neebor, I I'm three times doubly o'er your debtor For your auld-farrant, frien'ly letter; Tho' I maun say't, I doubt ye flatter, Ye speak sae fair: For my puir, silly, rhymin clatter Some less maun sair. II Hale be your heart, hale be your fiddle! Lang may your elbuck jink an' diddle To cheer you thro' the weary widdle O' war'ly cares, Till bairns' bairns kindly cuddle Your auld grey hairs! III But Davie, lad, I'm red ye're glaikit: I'm tauld the Muse ye hae negleckit; An' gif it's sae, ye sud be lickit Until ye fyke; Sic han's as you sud ne'er be faiket, Be hain't wha like. IV For me, I'm on Parnassus' brink, Rivin the words to gar them clink; Whyles daez't wi' love, whyles daez't wi' drink Wi' jads or Masons, An' whyles, but ay owre late I think, Braw sober lessons. V Of a' the thoughtless sons o' man Commen' me to the Bardie clan: Except it be some idle plan O' rhymin clink— The devil-haet that I sud ban!— They never think. VI Nae thought, nae view, nae scheme o' livin, Nae cares to gie us joy or grievin, But just the pouchie put the nieve in, An' while ought's there, Then, hiltie-skiltie, we gae scrievin, An' fash nae mair. VII Leeze me on rhyme! It's ay a treasure, My chief, amaist my only pleasure; At hame, a-fiel', at wark or leisure, The Muse, poor hizzie! Tho' rough an' raploch be her measure, She's seldom lazy. VIII Haud to the Muse, my dainty Davie: The warl' may play you monie a shavie, But for the Muse, she'll never leave ye, Tho' e'er sae puir; Na, even tho' limpin wi' the spavie Frae door to door! TO JOHN KENNEDY, DUMFRIES HOUSE I Now, Kennedy, if foot or horse E'er bring you in by Mauchlin Corss (Lord, man, there's lasses there wad force A hermit's fancy; And down the gate in faith! they're worse An' mair unchancy): II But as I'm sayin, please step to Dow's, An' taste sic gear as Johnie brews, Till some bit callan bring me news That ye are there; An' if we dinna hae a bowse, I'se ne'er drink mair. III It's no I like to sit an' swallow, Then like a swine to puke an' wallow; But gie me just a true guid fallow Wi' right ingíne, And spunkie ance to mak us mellow, An' then we'll shine! IV Now if ye're ane o' warl's folk, Wha rate the wearer by the cloak, An' sklent on poverty their joke Wi' bitter sneer, Wi' you nae friendship I will troke, Nor cheap nor dear. V But if, as I'm informèd weel, Ye hate as ill's the vera Deil The flinty heart that canna feel— Come, sir, here's tae you! Hae, there's my han', I wiss you weel, An' Gude be wi' you! Robt. Burness. Mossgiel, 3rd March 1786. TO GAVIN HAMILTON, ESQ., MAUCHLINE RECOMMENDING A BOY Mossgaville, May 3, 1786 I hold it, Sir, my bounden duty To warn you how that Master Tootie, Alías Laird M'Gaun, Was here to hire yon lad away 'Bout whom ye spak the tither day, An' wad hae don't aff han'; But lest he learn the callan tricks— As faith! I muckle doubt him— Like scrapin out auld Crummie's nicks, An' tellin lies about them, As lieve then, I'd have then Your clerkship he should sair, If sae be ye may be Not fitted otherwhere. Altho' I say't, he's gleg enough, An' bout a house that's rude an' rough The boy might learn to swear; But then wi' you he'll be sae taught, An' get sic fair example straught, I hae na onie fear: Ye'll catechise him every quirk, An' shore him weel wi' ‘Hell’; An' gar him follow to the kirk— Ay when ye gang yoursel! If ye, then, maun be then Frae hame this comin Friday, Then please, Sir, to lea'e, Sir, The orders wi' your lady. My word of honour I hae gien, In Paisley John's that night at e'en To meet the ‘warld's worm,’ To try to get the twa to gree, An' name the airles an' the fee In legal mode an' form: I ken he weel a snick can draw, When simple bodies let him; An' if a Devil be at a', In faith he's sure to get him. To phrase you an' praise you, Ye ken, your Laureat scorns: The pray'r still you share still Of grateful Minstrel Burns. TO MR. M'ADAM OF CRAIGEN-GILLAN IN ANSWER TO AN OBLIGING LETTER HE SENT IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY POETIC CAREER I Sir, o'er a gill I gat your card, I trow it made me proud. ‘See wha taks notice o' the Bard!’ I lap, and cry'd fu' loud. II Now deil-ma-care about their jaw, The senseless, gawky million! I'll cock my nose aboon them a': I'm roos'd by Craigen-Gillan! III 'Twas noble, sir; 'twas like yoursel, To grant your high protection: A great man's smile, ye ken fu' well, Is ay a blest infection. IV Tho', by his banes wha in a tub Match'd Macedonian Sandy! On my ain legs thro' dirt and dub I independent stand ay; V And when those legs to guid warm kail Wi' welcome canna bear me, A lee dyke-side, a sybow-tail, An' barley-scone shall cheer me. VI Heaven spare you lang to kiss the breath O' monie flow'ry simmers, An' bless your bonie lasses baith (I'm tauld they're loosome kimmers)! VII An' God bless young Dunaskin's laird, The blossom of our gentry, An' may he wear an auld man's beard, A credit to his country! REPLY TO AN INVITATION Sir, Yours this moment I unseal, And faith! I'm gay and hearty. To tell the truth and shame the Deil, I am as fou as Bartie. But Foorsday, Sir, my promise leal, Expect me o' your partie, If on a beastie I can speel Or hurl in a cartie. Yours,—Robert Burns. Machlin, Monday Night, 10 o'clock TO DR. MACKENZIE An Invitation to a Masonic Gathering Friday first's the day appointed By our Right Worshipful Anointed To hold our grand procession, To get a blaud o' Johnie's morals, An' taste a swatch o' Manson's barrels I' th'way of our profession. Our Master and the Brotherhood Wad a' be glad to see you. For me, I wad be mair than proud To share the mercies wi' you. If Death, then, wi' skaith then Some mortal heart is hechtin, Inform him, an' storm him, That Saturday ye'll fecht him. Robert Burns, D.M. Mossgiel, 14th June, A.M. 5790 TO JOHN KENNEDY A Farewell Farewell, dear friend! may guid luck hit you, And 'mong her favourites admit you! If e'er Detraction shore to smit you, May nane believe him! And onie deil that thinks to get you, Good Lord, deceive him! TO WILLIE CHALMERS' SWEETHEART I Wi' braw new branks in mickle pride, And eke a braw new brechan, My Pegasus I'm got astride, And up Parnassus pechin: Whyles owre a bush wi' downward crush The doited beastie stammers; Then up he gets, and off he sets For sake o' Willie Chalmers. II I doubt na, lass, that weel kend name May cost a pair o' blushes: I am nae stranger to your fame, Nor his warm-urgèd wishes: Your bonie face, sae mild and sweet, His honest heart enamours; And faith! ye'll no be lost a whit, Tho' wair'd on Willie Chalmers. III Auld Truth hersel might swear ye're fair, And Honor safely back her; And Modesty assume your air, And ne'er a ane mistak her; And sic twa love-inspiring een Might fire even holy palmers: Nae wonder then they've fatal been To honest Willie Chalmers! IV I doubt na Fortune may you shore Some mim-mou'd, pouther'd priestie, Fu' lifted up wi' Hebrew lore And band upon his breastie; But O, what signifies to you His lexicons and grammars? The feeling heart's the royal blue, And that's wi' Willie Chalmers. V Some gapin, glowrin countra laird May warsle for your favour: May claw his lug, and straik his beard, And hoast up some palaver. My bonie maid, before ye wed Sic clumsy-witted hammers, Seek Heaven for help, and barefit skelp Awa wi' Willie Chalmers. VI Forgive the Bard! My fond regard For ane that shares my bosom Inspires my Muse to gie'm his dues, For deil a hair I roose him. May Powers aboon unite you soon, And fructify your ámours, And every year come in mair dear To you and Willie Chalmers! TO AN OLD SWEETHEART WRITTEN ON A COPY OF HIS POEMS I Once fondly lov'd and still remember'd dear, Sweet early object of my youthful vows, Accept this mark of friendship, warm, sincere— (Friendship! 'tis all cold duty now allows); II And when you read the simple artless rhymes, One friendly sigh for him—he asks no more— Who, distant, burns in flaming torrid climes, Or haply lies beneath th'Atlantic roar. EXTEMPORE TO GAVIN HAMILTON STANZAS ON NAETHING I To you, Sir, this summons I've sent (Pray, whip till the pownie is fraething!); But if you demand what I want, I honestly answer you—naething. II Ne'er scorn a poor Poet like me For idly just living and breathing, While people of every degree Are busy employed about—naething. III Poor Centum-per-Centum may fast, And grumble his hurdies their claithing; He'll find, when the balance is cast, He's gane to the Devil for—naething. IV The courtier cringes and bows; Ambition has likewise its plaything— A coronet beams on his brows; And what is a coronet?—Naething. V Some quarrel the Presbyter gown, Some quarrel Episcopal graithing; But every good fellow will own The quarrel is a' about—naething. VI The lover may sparkle and glow, Approaching his bonie bit gay thing; But marriage will soon let him know He's gotten—a buskit-up naething. VII The Poet may jingle and rhyme In hopes of a laureate wreathing, And when he has wasted his time, He's kindly rewarded with—naething. VIII The thundering bully may rage, And swagger and swear like a heathen; But collar him fast, I'll engage, You'll find that his courage is—naething. IX Last night with a feminine Whig— A poet she couldna put faith in! But soon we grew lovingly big, I taught her, her terrors were—naething. X Her Whigship was wonderful pleased, But charmingly tickled wi' ae thing; Her fingers I lovingly squeezed, And kissed her, and promised her—naething. XI The priest anathèmas may threat— Predicament, sir, that we're baith in; But when Honor's reveillé is beat, The holy artillery's—naething. XII And now I must mount on the wave: My voyage perhaps there is death in; But what is a watery grave? The drowning a Poet is—naething. XIII And now, as grim Death's in my thought, To you, Sir, I make this bequeathing: My service as long as ye've ought, And my friendship, by God, when ye've—naething. REPLY TO A TRIMMING EPISTLE RECEIVED FROM A TAILOR I What ails ye now, ye lousie bitch, To thresh my back at sic a pitch? Losh, man, hae mercy wi' your natch! Your bodkin's bauld: I didna suffer half sae much Frae Daddie Auld. II What tho' at times, when I grow crouse, I gie their wames a random pouse, Is that enough for you to souse Your servant sae? Gae mind your seam, ye prick-the-louse An' jag-the-flae! III King David o' poetic brief Wrocht 'mang the lassies sic mischíef As fill'd his after-life with grief An' bloody rants; An' yet he's rank'd amang the chief O' lang-syne saunts. IV And maybe, Tam, for a' my cants, My wicked rhymes an' drucken rants, I'll gie auld Cloven-Clootie's haunts An unco slip yet, An' snugly sit amang the saunts At Davie's hip yet! V But, fegs! the Session says I maun Gae fa' upo' anither plan Than garrin lasses coup the cran, Clean heels owre body, An' sairly thole their mither's ban Afore the howdy. VI This leads me on to tell for sport How I did wi' the Session sort: Auld Clinkum at the inner port Cried three times:—‘Robin! Come hither lad, and answer for't, Ye're blam'd for jobbin!’ VII Wi' pinch I put a Sunday's face on, An' snoov'd awa' before the Session: I made an open, fair confession— I scorn'd to lie— An' syne Mess John, beyond expression, Fell foul o' me. VIII A fornicator-loun he call'd me, An' said my faut frae bliss expell'd me. I own'd the tale was true he tell'd me, ‘But, what the matter?’ (Quo' I) ‘I fear unless ye geld me, I'll ne'er be better!’ IX ‘Geld you!’ (quo' he) ‘an' what for no? If that your right hand, leg, or toe Should ever prove your sp'ritual foe, You should remember To cut it aff; an' what for no Your dearest member?’ X ‘Na, na’ (quo' I), ‘I'm no for that, Gelding's nae better than 'tis ca't; I'd rather suffer for my faut A hearty flewit, As sair owre hip as ye can draw't, Tho' I should rue it. XI ‘Or, gin ye like to end the bother, To please us a'—I've just ae ither: When next wi' yon lass I forgather, Whate'er betide it, I'll frankly gie her't a' thegither, An' let her guide it.’ XII But, Sir, this pleas'd them warst of a', An' therefore, Tam, when that I saw, I said ‘Guid-night,’ an' cam awa, An' left the Session: I saw they were resolvèd a' On my oppression. TO MAJOR LOGAN I Hail, thairm-inspirin, rattlin Willie! Tho' Fortune's road be rough an' hilly To every fiddling, rhyming billie, We never heed, But take it like the unbrack'd filly Proud o' her speed. IX We've faults and failins—granted clearly! We're frail, backsliding mortals merely; Eve's bonie squad, priests wyte them sheerly For our grand fa'; But still, but still—I like them dearly . . . God bless them a'! X Ochon for poor Castalian drinkers, When they fa' foul o' earthly jinkers! The witching, curs'd, delicious blinkers Hae put me hyte, An' gart me weet my waukrife winkers Wi' girnin spite. XI But by yon moon—and that's high swearin!— An' every star within my hearin, An' by her een wha was a dear ane I'll ne'er forget, I hope to gie the jads a clearin In fair play yet! XII My loss I mourn, but not repent it; I'll seek my pursie whare I tint it; Ance to the Indies I were wonted, Some cantraip hour By some sweet elf I'll yet be dinted: Then vive l'amour! XIII Faites mes baissemains respectueusè To sentimental sister Susie And honest Lucky: no to roose you, Ye may be proud, That sic a couple Fate allows ye To grace your blood. XIV Nae mair at present can I measure, An' trowth! my rhymin ware's nae treasure; But when in Ayr, some half-hour's leisure, Be't light, be't dark, Sir Bard will do himself the pleasure To call at Park. Robert Burns. Mossgiel, 30th October, 1786 TO THE GUIDWIFE OF WAUCHOPE HOUSE (MRS. SCOTT) Guid Wife, I I mind it weel, in early date, When I was beardless, young, and blate, An' first could thresh the barn, Or haud a yokin at the pleugh, An', tho' forfoughten sair eneugh, Yet unco proud to learn; When first amang the yellow corn A man I reckon'd was, An' wi' the lave ilk merry morn Could rank my rig and lass: Still shearing, and clearing The tither stookèd raw, Wi' clavers an' havers Wearing the day awa. II E'en then, a wish (I mind its pow'r), A wish that to my latest hour Shall strongly heave my breast, That I for poor auld Scotland's sake Some usefu' plan or book could make, Or sing a sang at least. The rough burr-thistle spreading wide Amang the bearded bear, I turn'd the weeder-clips aside, An' spar'd the symbol dear. No nation, no station My envy e'er could raise; A Scot still, but blot still, I knew nae higher praise. III But still the elements o' sang In formless jumble, right an' wrang, Wild floated in my brain; Till on that hairst I said before, My partner in the merry core, She rous'd the forming strain. I see her yet, the sonsie quean That lighted up my jingle, Her witching smile, her pauky een That gart my heart-strings tingle! I firèd, inspirèd, At ev'ry kindling keek, But, bashing and dashing, I fearèd ay to speak. IV Hale to the sex! (ilk guid chiel says): Wi' merry dance on winter days, An' we to share in common! The gust o' joy, the balm of woe, The saul o' life, the heav'n below Is rapture-giving Woman. Ye surly sumphs, who hate the name, Be mindfu' o' your mither: She, honest woman, may think shame That ye're connected with her! Ye're wae men, ye're nae men That slight the lovely dears; To shame ye, disclaim ye, Ilk honest birkie swears. V For you, no bred to barn and byre, Wha sweetly tune the Scottish lyre, Thanks to you for your line! The marl'd plaid ye kindly spare, By me should gratefully be ware; 'Twad please me to the nine. I'd be mair vauntie o' my hap, Douce hingin owre my curple, Than onie ermine ever lap, Or proud imperial purple. Farewell, then! lang hale, then, An' plenty be your fa'! May losses and crosses Ne'er at your hallan ca'! R. Burns. March, 1787 TO WM. TYTLER, ESQ., OF WOODHOUSELEE WITH AN IMPRESSION OF THE AUTHOR'S PORTRAIT I Reverèd defender of beauteous Stuart, Of Stuart!—a name once respected, A name which to love was once mark of a true heart, But now 'tis despis'd and neglected! II Tho' something like moisture conglobes in my eye— Let no one misdeem me disloyal! A poor friendless wand'rer may well claim a sigh— Still more, if that wand'rer were royal. III My Fathers that name have rever'd on a throne; My Fathers have fallen to right it: Those Fathers would spurn their degenerate son, That name, should he scoffingly slight it. IV Still in prayers for King George I most heartily join, The Queen, and the rest of the gentry; Be they wise, be they foolish, is nothing of mine: Their title's avow'd by my country. V But why of that epocha make such a fuss That gave us the Hanover stem? If bringing them over was lucky for us, I'm sure 'twas as lucky for them. VI But loyalty—truce! we're on dangerous ground: Who knows how the fashions may alter? The doctrine, to-day that is loyalty sound, To-morrow may bring us a halter! VII I send you a trifle, a head of a Bard, A trifle scarce worthy your care; But accept it, good Sir, as a mark of regard, Sincere as a saint's dying prayer. VIII Now Life's chilly evening dim-shades on your eye, And ushers the long dreary night; But you, like the star that athwart gilds the sky, Your course to the latest is bright. TO MR. RENTON OF LAMERTON Your billet, Sir, I grant receipt; Wi' you I'll canter onie gate, Tho' 'twere a trip to yon blue warl' Where birkies march on burning marl: Then, Sir, God willing, I'll attend ye, And to His goodness I commend ye. R. Burns. TO MISS ISABELLA MACLEOD Edinburgh, March 16, 1787 I The crimson blossom charms the bee, The summer sun the swallow: So dear this tuneful gift to me From lovely Isabella. II Her portrait fair upon my mind Revolving time shall mellow, And mem'ry's latest effort find The lovely Isabella. III No Bard nor lover's rapture this In fancies vain and shallow! She is, so come my soul to bliss, The Lovely Isabella! TO SYMON GRAY I Symon Gray, you're dull to-day! Dullness with redoubled sway Has seized the wits of Symon Gray. II Dear Symon Gray, the other day When you sent me some rhyme, I could not then just ascertain Its worth for want of time; III But now to-day, good Mr. Gray, I've read it o'er and o'er: Tried all my skill, but find I'm still Just where I was before. IV We auld wives' minions gie our opinions, Solicited or no; Then of its fauts my honest thoughts I'll give—and here they go: V Such damn'd bombást no age that's past Can show, nor time to come; So, Symon dear, your song I'll tear, And with it wipe my bum. TO MISS FERRIER I Nae heathen name shall I prefix Frae Pindus or Parnassus; Auld Reekie dings them a' to sticks For rhyme-inspiring lasses. II Jove's tunefu' dochters three times three Made Homer deep their debtor; But gien the body half an e'e, Nine Ferriers wad done better! III Last day my mind was in a bog; Down George's Street I stoited; A creeping, cauld, prosaic fog My very senses doited; IV Do what I dought to set her free, My saul lay in the mire: Ye turned a neuk, I saw your e'e, She took the wing like fire! V The mournfu' sang I here enclose, In gratitude I send you, And pray, in rhyme as weel as prose, A' guid things may attend you! SYLVANDER TO CLARINDA I When dear Clarinda, matchless fair, First struck Sylvander's raptur'd view, He gaz'd, he listened to despair— Alas! 'twas all he dared to do. II Love from Clarinda's heavenly eyes Transfix'd his bosom thro' and thro, But still in Friendship's guarded guise— For more the demon fear'd to do. III That heart, already more than lost, The imp beleaguer'd all perdu; For frowning Honor kept his post— To meet that frown he shrunk to do. IV His pangs the Bard refus'd to own, Tho' half he wish'd Clarinda knew; But Anguish wrung the unweeting groan— Who blames what frantic Pain must do? V That heart, where motley follies blend, Was sternly still to Honor true: To prove Clarinda's fondest friend Was what a lover, sure, might do! VI The Muse his ready quill employ'd; No nearer bliss he could pursue; That bliss Clarinda cold deny'd— ‘Send word by Charles how you do!’ VII The chill behest disarm'd his Muse, Till Passion all impatient grew: He wrote, and hinted for excuse, ‘'Twas 'cause he'd nothing else to do.’ VIII But by those hopes I have above! And by those faults I dearly rue! The deed, the boldest mark of love, For thee that deed I dare to do! IX O, could the Fates but name the price Would bless me with your charms and you, With frantic joy I'd pay it thrice, If human art or power could do! X Then take, Clarinda, friendship's hand (Friendship, at least, I may avow), And lay no more your chill command— I'll write, whatever I've to do. Sylvander. Wednesday night TO CLARINDA WITH A PAIR OF WINE-GLASSES I Fair Empress of the Poet's soul And Queen of Poetesses, Clarinda, take this little boon, This humble pair of glasses; II And fill them up with generous juice, As generous as your mind; And pledge them to the generous toast: ‘The whole of human kind!’ III ‘To those who love us!’ second fill; But not to those whom we love, Lest we love those who love not us! A third:—‘To thee and me, love!’ TO HUGH PARKER In this strange land, this uncouth clime, A land unknown to prose or rhyme; Where words ne'er cros't the Muse's heckles, Nor limpit in poetic shackles: A land that Prose did never view it, Except when drunk he stacher't thro' it: Here, ambush'd by the chimla cheek, Hid in an atmosphere of reek, I hear a wheel thrum i' the neuk, I hear it—for in vain I leuk: The red peat gleams, a fiery kernel Enhuskèd by a fog infernal. Here, for my wonted rhyming raptures, I sit and count my sins by chapters; For life and spunk like ither Christians, I'm dwindled down to mere existence; Wi' nae converse but Gallowa' bodies, Wi' nae kend face but Jenny Geddes. Jenny, my Pegasean pride, Dowie she saunters down Nithside, And ay a westlin leuk she throws, While tears hap o'er her auld brown nose! Was it for this wi' cannie care Thou bure the Bard through many a shire? At howes or hillocks never stumbled, And late or early never grumbled? O, had I power like inclination, I'd heeze thee up a constellation! To canter with the Sagitarre, Or loup the Ecliptic like a bar, Or turn the Pole like any arrow; Or, when auld Phœbus bids good-morrow, Down the Zodíac urge the race, And cast dirt on his godship's face: For I could lay my bread and kail He'd ne'er cast saut upo' thy tail!. . . Wi' a' this care and a' this grief, And sma', sma' prospect of relief, And nought but peat reek i' my head, How can I write what ye can read?— Tarbolton, twenty-fourth o' June, Ye'll find me in a better tune; But till we meet and weet our whistle, Tak this excuse for nae epistle. Robert Burns. TO ALEX. CUNNINGHAM Ellisland in Nithsdale, July 27th, 1788 I My godlike friend—nay, do not stare: You think the praise is odd-like? But ‘God is Love,’ the saints declare; Then surely thou art god-like! II And is thy ardour still the same, And kindled still in Anna? Others may boast a partial flame, But thou art a volcano! III Even Wedlock asks not love beyond Death's tie-dissolving portal; But thou, omnipotently fond, May'st promise love immortal! IV Thy wounds such healing powers defy, Such symptoms dire attend them, That last great antihectic try— Marriage perhaps may mend them. V Sweet Anna has an air—a grace, Divine, magnetic, touching! She takes, she charms—but who can trace The process of bewitching? TO ROBERT GRAHAM, ESQ., OF FINTRY REQUESTING A FAVOUR When Nature her great master-piece design'd, And fram'd her last, best work, the human mind, Her eye intent on all the wondrous plan, She form'd of various stuff the various Man. The useful many first, she calls them forth— Plain plodding Industry and sober Worth: Thence peasants, farmers, native sons of earth, And merchandise' whole genus take their birth; Each prudent cit a warm existence finds, And all mechanics' many-apron'd kinds. Some other rarer sorts are wanted yet— The lead and buoy are needful to the net: The caput mortuum of gross desires Makes a material for mere knights and squires; The martial phosphorus is taught to flow; She kneads the lumpish philosophic dough, Then marks th'unyielding mass with grave designs— Law, physic, politics, and deep divines; Last, she sublimes th'Aurora of the poles, The flashing elements of female souls. The order'd system fair before her stood; Nature, well pleas'd, pronounc'd it very good; Yet ere she gave creating labour o'er, Half-jest, she tried one curious labour more. Some spumy, fiery, ignis fatuus matter, Such as the slightest breath of air might scatter; With arch-alacrity and conscious glee (Nature may have her whim as well as we: Her Hogarth-art, perhaps she meant to show it), She forms the thing, and christens it—a Poet: Creature, tho' oft the prey of care and sorrow, When blest to-day, unmindful of to-morrow; A being form'd t'amuse his graver friends; Admir'd and prais'd—and there the wages ends; A mortal quite unfit for Fortune's strife, Yet oft the sport of all the ills of life; Prone to enjoy each pleasure riches give, Yet haply wanting wherewithal to live; Longing to wipe each tear, to heal each groan, Yet frequent all unheeded in his own. But honest Nature is not quite a Turk: She laugh'd at first, then felt for her poor work. Viewing the propless climber of mankind, She cast about a standard tree to find; In pity for his helpless woodbine state, She clasp'd his tendrils round the truly great: A title, and the only one I claim, To lay strong hold for help on bounteous Graham. Pity the hapless Muses' tuneful train! Weak, timid landsmen on life's stormy main, Their hearts no selfish, stern, absorbent stuff, That never gives—tho' humbly takes—enough: The little Fate allows, they share as soon, Unlike sage, proverb'd Wisdom's hard-wrung boon. The world were blest did bliss on them depend— Ah, that ‘the friendly e'er should want a friend!’ Let Prudence number o'er each sturdy son Who life and wisdom at one race begun, Who feel by reason, and who give by rule (Instinct's a brute, and Sentiment a fool!), Who make poor ‘will do’ wait upon ‘I should’— We own they're prudent, but who owns they're good? Ye wise ones, hence! ye hurt the social eye, God's image rudely etch'd on base alloy! But come ye who the godlike pleasure know, Heaven's attribute distinguish'd—to bestow! Whose arms of love would grasp all human race: Come thou who giv'st with all a courtier's grace— Friend of my life, true patron of my rhymes, Prop of my dearest hopes for future times! Why shrinks my soul, half blushing, half afraid, Backward, abash'd to ask thy friendly aid? I know my need, I know thy giving hand, I tax thy friendship at thy kind command. But there are such who court the tuneful Nine (Heavens! should the branded character be mine!), Whose verse in manhood's pride sublimely flows, Yet vilest reptiles in their begging prose. Mark, how their lofty independent spirit Soars on the spurning wing of injur'd merit! Seek you the proofs in private life to find? Pity the best of words should be but wind! So to Heaven's gates the lark's shrill song ascends, But grovelling on the earth the carol ends. In all the clam'rous cry of starving want, They dun Benevolence with shameless front; Oblige them, patronise their tinsel lays— They persecute you all your future days! Ere my poor soul such deep damnation stain, My horny fist assume the plough again! The pie-bald jacket let me patch once more! On eighteenpence a week I've liv'd before. Tho', thanks to Heaven, I dare even that last shift, I trust, meantime, my boon is in thy gift: That, plac'd by thee upon the wish'd-for height, With man and nature fairer in her sight, My Muse may imp her wing for some sublimer flight. IMPROMPTU TO CAPTAIN RIDDELL ON RETURNING A NEWSPAPER Ellisland, Monday Evening I Your News and Review, Sir, I've read through and through, Sir, With little admiring or blaming: The Papers are barren Of home-news or foreign— No murders or rapes worth the naming. II Our friends, the Reviewers, Those chippers and hewers, Are judges of mortar and stone, Sir; But of meet or unmeet In a fabric complete I'll boldly pronounce they are none, Sir. III My goose-quill too rude is To tell all your goodness Bestow'd on your servant, the Poet; Would to God I had one Like a beam of the sun, And then all the world, Sir, should know it! REPLY TO A NOTE FROM CAPTAIN RIDDELL Ellisland Dear Sir, at onie time or tide I'd rather sit wi' you than ride, Tho' 'twere wi' royal Geordie: And trowth! your kindness soon and late Aft gars me to mysel look blate— The Lord in Heaven reward ye! R. Burns. TO JAMES TENNANT OF GLENCONNER Auld comrade dear and brither sinner, How's a' the folk about Glenconner? How do you this blae eastlin wind, That's like to blaw a body blind? For me, my faculties are frozen, My dearest member nearly dozen'd. I've sent you here, by Johnie Simson, Twa sage philosophers to glimpse on: Smith wi' his sympathetic feeling, An' Reid to common sense appealing. Philosophers have fought and wrangled, An' meikle Greek an' Latin mangled, Till, wi' their logic-jargon tir'd And in the depth of science mir'd, To common sense they now appeal— What wives and wabsters see and feel! But, hark ye, friend! I charge you strictly, Peruse them, an' return them quickly: For now I'm grown sae cursed douse I pray and ponder butt the house; My shins my lane I there sit roastin, Perusing Bunyan, Brown, an' Boston; Till by an' by, if I haud on, I'll grunt a reál gospel groan. Already I begin to try it, To cast my een up like a pyet, When by the gun she tumbles o'er, Flutt'ring an' gasping in her gore: Sae shortly you shall see me bright, A burning an' a shining light. My heart-warm love to guid auld Glen, The ace an' wale of honest men: When bending down wi' auld grey hairs Beneath the load of years and cares, May He who made him still support him, An' views beyond the grave comfórt him! His worthy fam'ly far and near, God bless them a' wi' grace and gear! My auld schoolfellow, preacher Willie, The manly tar, my Mason-billie, And Auchenbay, I wish him joy; If he's a parent, lass or boy, May he be dad and Meg the mither Just five-and-forty years thegither! And no forgetting wabster Charlie, I'm tauld he offers very fairly. An', Lord, remember singing Sannock Wi' hale breeks, saxpence, an' a bannock! And next, my auld acquaintance, Nancy, Since she is fitted to her fancy, An' her kind stars hae airted till her A guid chiel wi' a pickle siller! My kindest, best respects, I sen' it, To cousin Kate, an' sister Janet: Tell them, frae me, wi' chiels be cautious, For, faith! they'll aiblins fin' them fashious; To grant a heart is fairly civil, But to grant a maidenhead's the devil! An' lastly, Jamie, for yoursel, May guardian angels tak a spell, An' steer you seven miles south o' Hell! But first, before you see Heaven's glory, May ye get monie a merry story, Monie a laugh and monie a drink, And ay eneugh o' needfu' clink! Now fare ye weel, an' joy be wi' you! For my sake, this I beg it o' you: Assist poor Simson a' ye can; Ye'll fin' him just an honest man. Sae I conclude, and quat my chanter, Yours, saint or sinner, Rab the Ranter. TO JOHN M'MURDO WITH SOME OF THE AUTHOR'S POEMS I O, could I give thee India's wealth, As I this trifle send! Because thy Joy in both would be To share them with a friend! II But golden sands did never grace The Heliconian stream; Then take what gold could never buy— An honest Bard's esteem. SONNET TO ROBERT GRAHAM, ESQ. OF FINTRY ON RECEIVING A FAVOUR, 19TH AUGUST 1789 I call no Goddess to inspire my strains: A fabled Muse may suit a Bard that feigns. Friend of my life! my ardent spirit burns, And all the tribute of my heart returns, For boons accorded, goodness ever new, The gift still dearer, as the giver you. Thou orb of day! thou other paler light! And all ye many sparkling stars of night! If aught that giver from my mind efface, If I that giver's bounty e'er disgrace, Then roll to me along your wand'ring spheres Only to number out a villain's years! I lay my hand upon my swelling breast, And grateful would, but cannot, speak the rest. EPISTLE TO DR. BLACKLOCK Ellisland, 21st Oct., 1789. I Wow, but your letter made me vauntie! And are ye hale, and weel, and cantie? I kend it still, your wee bit jauntie Wad bring ye to: Lord send you ay as weel's I want ye, And then ye'll do! II The Ill-Thief blaw the Heron south, And never drink be near his drouth! He tauld mysel by word o' mouth, He'd tak my letter: I lippen'd to the chiel in trowth, And bade nae better. III But aiblins honest Master Heron Had at the time some dainty fair one To ware his theologic care on And holy study, And, tired o' sauls to waste his lear on, E'en tried the body. IV But what d'ye think, my trusty fier? I'm turned a gauger—Peace be here! Parnassian queires, I fear, I fear, Ye'll now disdain me, And then my fifty pounds a year Will little gain me! V Ye glaikit, gleesome, dainty damies, Wha by Castalia's wimplin streamies Lowp, sing, and lave your pretty limbies, Ye ken, ye ken, That strang necessity supreme is 'Mang sons o' men. VI I hae a wife and twa wee laddies; They maun hae brose and brats o' duddies: Ye ken yoursels my heart right proud is— I need na vaunt— But I'll sned besoms, thraw saugh woodies, Before they want. VII Lord help me thro' this warld o' care! I'm weary—sick o't late and air! Not but I hae a richer share Than monie ithers; But why should ae man better fare, And a' men brithers? VIII Come, firm Resolve, take thou the van, Thou stalk o' carl-hemp in man! And let us mind, faint heart ne'er wan A lady fair: Wha does the utmost that he can Will whyles do mair. IX But to conclude my silly rhyme (I'm scant o' verse and scant o' time): To make a happy fireside clime To weans and wife, That's the true pathos and sublime Of human life. X My compliments to sister Beckie, And eke the same to honest Lucky: I wat she is a daintie chuckie As e'er tread clay: And gratefully, my guid auld cockie, I'm yours for ay. Robert Burns. TO A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SENT A NEWSPAPER, AND OFFERED TO CONTINUE IT FREE OF EXPENSE Kind Sir, I've read your paper through, And faith, to me 'twas really new! How guessed ye, Sir, what maist I wanted? This monie a day I've grain'd and gaunted, To ken what French mischief was brewin; Or what the drumlie Dutch were doin; That vile doup-skelper, Emperor Joseph, If Venus yet had got his nose off; Or how the collieshangie works Atween the Russians and the Turks; Or if the Swede, before he halt, Would play anither Charles the Twalt; If Denmark, any body spak o't; Or Poland, wha had now the tack o't; How cut-throat Prussian blades were hingin; How libbet Italy was singing; If Spaniard, Portuguese, or Swiss Were sayin or takin aught amiss; Or how our merry lads at hame In Britain's court kept up the game: How royal George—the Lord leuk o'er him!— Was managing St. Stephen's quorum; If sleekit Chatham Will was livin, Or glaikit Charlie got his nieve in; How Daddie Burke the plea was cookin; If Warren Hastings' neck was yeukin; How cesses, stents, and fees were rax'd, Or if bare arses yet were tax'd; The news o' princes, dukes, and earls, Pimps, sharpers, bawds, and opera-girls; If that daft buckie, Geordie Wales, Was threshin still at hizzies' tails; Or if he was grown oughtlins douser, And no a perfect kintra cooser: A' this and mair I never heard of, And, but for you, I might despair'd of. So, gratefu', back your news I send you, And pray a' guid things may attend you! Ellisland, Monday Morning TO PETER STUART Dear Peter, dear Peter, We poor sons of metre Are often negleckit, ye ken: For instance your sheet, man (Tho' glad I'm to see't, man), I get it no ae day in ten. TO JOHN MAXWELL, ESQ. OF TERRAUGHTIE ON HIS BIRTH-DAY I Health to the Maxwells' vet'ran Chief! Health ay unsour'd by care or grief! Inspir'd, I turn'd Fate's sibyl leaf This natal morn: I see thy life is stuff o' prief, Scarce quite half-worn. II This day thou metes threescore eleven, And I can tell that bounteous Heaven (The second-sight, ye ken, is given To ilka Poet) On thee a tack o' seven times seven, Will yet bestow it. III If envious buckies view wi' sorrow Thy lengthen'd days on thy blest morrow, May Desolation's lang-teeth'd harrow, Nine miles an' hour, Rake them, like Sodom and Gomorrah, In brunstane stoure! IV But for thy friends, and they are monie, Baith honest men and lasses bonie, May couthie Fortune, kind and cannie In social glee, Wi' mornings blythe and e'enings funny Bless them and thee! V Fareweel, auld birkie! Lord be near ye, And then the Deil, he daurna steer ye! Your friends ay love, your foes ay fear ye! For me, shame fa' me, If neist my heart I dinna wear ye, While Burns they ca' me! TO WILLIAM STEWART In honest Bacon's ingle-neuk Here maun I sit and think, Sick o' the warld and warld's folk, An' sick, damn'd sick, o' drink! I see, I see there is nae help, But still doun I maun sink, Till some day laigh enough I yelp:— ‘Wae worth that cursed drink!’ Yestreen, alas! I was sae fu' I could but yisk and wink; And now, this day, sair, sair I rue The weary, weary drink. Satan, I fear thy sooty claws, I hate thy brunstane stink, And ay I curse the luckless cause— The wicked soup o' drink. In vain I would forget my woes In idle rhyming clink, For, past redemption damn'd in prose, I can do nought but drink. To you my trusty, well-tried friend, May heaven still on you blink! And may your life flow to the end, Sweet as a dry man's drink! INSCRIPTION TO MISS GRAHAM OF FINTRY I Here, where the Scottish Muse immortal lives In sacred strains and tuneful numbers join'd, Accept the gift! Though humble he who gives, Rich is the tribute of the grateful mind. II So may no ruffian feeling in thy breast, Discordant, jar thy bosom-chords among! But Peace attune thy gentle soul to rest, Or Love ecstatic wake his seraph song! III Or Pity's notes in luxury of tears, As modest Want the tale of woe reveals; While conscious Virtue all the strain endears, And heaven-born Piety her sanction seals! Robert Burns. Dumfries, 31st January 1794 REMORSEFUL APOLOGY I The friend whom, wild from Wisdom's way, The fumes of wine infuriate send (Not moony madness more astray), Who but deplores that hapless friend? II Mine was th'insensate, frenzied part— Ah! why should I such scenes outlive? Scenes so abhorrent to my heart! 'Tis thine to pity and forgive. TO COLLECTOR MITCHELL I Friend of the Poet tried and leal, Wha wanting thee might beg or steal; Alake, alake, the meikle Deil Wi' a' his witches Are at it, skelpin jig an' reel In my poor pouches! II I modestly fu' fain wad hint it, That One-pound-one, I sairly want it; If wi' the hizzie down ye sent it, It would be kind; And while my heart wi' life-blood dunted, I'd bear't in mind! III So may the Auld Year gang out moanin To see the New come laden, groanin Wi' double plenty o'er the loanin To thee and thine: Domestic peace and comforts crownin The hale design! POSTSCRIPT IV Ye've heard this while how I've been licket, And by fell Death was nearly nicket: Grim loon! He got me by the fecket, And sair me sheuk; But by guid luck I lap a wicket, And turn'd a neuk. V But by that health, I've got a share o't, And by that life, I'm promis'd mair o't, My hale and weel, I'll tak a care o't A tentier way; Then farewell Folly, hide and hair o't, For ance and ay! TO COLONEL DE PEYSTER I My honor'd Colonel, deep I feel Your interest in the Poet's weal: Ah! now sma' heart hae I to speel The steep Parnassus, Surrounded thus by bolus pill And potion glasses. II O, what a canty warld were it, Would pain and care and sickness spare it, And Fortune favor worth and merit As they deserve, And ay rowth—roast-beef and claret!— Syne, wha wad starve? III Dame Life, tho' fiction out may trick her, And in paste gems and frippery deck her, Oh! flickering, feeble, and unsicker I've found her still: Ay wavering, like the willow-wicker, 'Tween good and ill! IV Then that curst carmagnole, Auld Satan, Watches, like baudrons by a ratton, Our sinfu' saul to get a claut on Wi' felon ire; Syne, whip! his tail ye'll ne'er cast saut on— He's aff like fire. V Ah Nick! Ah Nick! it is na fair, First showing us the tempting ware, Bright wines and bonie lasses rare, To put us daft; Syne weave, unseen, thy spider snare O' Hell's damned waft! VI Poor Man, the flie, aft bizzes by, And aft, as chance he comes thee nigh, Thy damn'd auld elbow yeuks wi' joy And hellish pleasure, Already in thy fancy's eye Thy sicker treasure! VII Soon, heels o'er gowdie, in he gangs, And, like a sheep-head on a tangs, Thy girnin laugh enjoys his pangs And murdering wrestle, As, dangling in the wind, he hangs A gibbet's tassle. VIII But lest you think I am uncivil To plague you with this draunting drivel, Abjuring a' intentions evil, I quat my pen: The Lord preserve us frae the Devil! Amen! Amen! TO MISS JESSIE LEWARS Thine be the volumes, Jessie fair, And with them take the Poet's prayer: That Fate may in her fairest page, With ev'ry kindliest, best presage Of future bliss enrol thy name; With native worth, and spotless fame, And wakeful caution, still aware Of ill—but chief Man's felon snare! All blameless joys on earth we find, And all the treasures of the mind— These be thy guardian and reward! So prays thy faithful friend, the Bard. Robert Burns. June 26th, 1796 INSCRIPTION WRITTEN ON THE BLANK LEAF OF A COPY OF THE LAST EDITION OF MY POEMS, PRESENTED TO THE LADY WHOM, IN SO MANY FICTITIOUS REVERIES OF PASSION, BUT WITH THE MOST ARDENT SENTIMENTS OF REAL FRIENDSHIP, I HAVE SO OFTEN SUNG UNDER THE NAME OF CHLORIS I 'Tis Friendship's pledge, my young, fair Friend, Nor thou the gift refuse; Nor with unwilling ear attend The moralising Muse. II Since thou in all thy youth and charms Must bid the world adieu (A world 'gainst peace in constant arms), To join the friendly few; III Since, thy gay morn of life o'ercast, Chill came the tempest's lour (And ne'er Misfortune's eastern blast Did nip a fairer flower); IV Since life's gay scenes must charm no more: Still much is left behind, Still nobler wealth hast thou in store— The comforts of the mind! V Thine is the self-approving glow Of conscious honor's part; And (dearest gift of Heaven below) Thine Friendship's truest heart; VI The joys refin'd of sense and taste, With every Muse to rove: And doubly were the Poet blest, These joys could he improve. Une Bagatelle de l' Amitié Coila THEATRICAL PIECES PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY MR. WOODS ON HIS BENEFIT NIGHT, MONDAY, 16TH APRIL, 1787 When by a generous Public's kind acclaim That dearest need is granted—honest fame; When here your favour is the actor's lot, Nor even the man in private life forgot; What breast so dead to heavenly Virtue's glow But heaves impassion'd with the grateful throe? Poor is the task to please a barb'rous throng: It needs no Siddons's powers in Southern's song. But here an ancient nation, fam'd afar For genius, learning high, as great in war. Hail, Caledonia, name for ever dear! Before whose sons I'm honor'd to appear! Where every science, every nobler art, That can inform the mind or mend the heart, Is known (as grateful nations oft have found), Far as the rude barbarian marks the bound! Philosophy, no idle pedant dream, Here holds her search by heaven-taught Reason's beam; Here History paints with elegance and force The tide of Empire's fluctuating course; Here Douglas forms wild Shakspeare into plan, And Harley rouses all the God in man. When well-form'd taste and sparkling wit unite With manly lore, or female beauty bright (Beauty, where faultless symmetry and grace Can only charm us in the second place), Witness my heart, how oft with panting fear, As on this night, I've met these judges here! But still the hope Experience taught to live: Equal to judge, you're candid to forgive. No hundred-headed Riot here we meet, With Decency and Law beneath his feet; Nor Insolence assumes fair Freedom's name: Like Caledonians you applaud or blame! O Thou, dread Power, Whose empire-giving hand Has oft been stretch'd to shield the honor'd land! Strong may she glow with all her ancient fire; May every son be worthy of his sire; Firm may she rise, with generous disdain At Tyranny's, or direr Pleasure's chain; Still self-dependent in her native shore, Bold may she brave grim Danger's loudest roar, Till Fate the curtain drop on worlds to be no more! PROLOGUE SPOKEN AT THE THEATRE OF DUMFRIES ON NEW YEAR'S DAY EVENING, 1790 No song nor dance I bring from yon great city That queens it o'er our taste—the more's the pity! Tho', by the bye, abroad why will you roam? Good sense and taste are natives here at home. But not for panegyric I appear: I come to wish you all a good New Year! Old Father Time deputes me here before ye, Not for to preach, but tell his simple story. The sage, grave Ancient cough'd, and bade me say: ‘You're one year older this important day.’ If wiser too—he hinted some suggestion, But 'twould be rude, you know, to ask the question; And with a would-be-roguish leer and wink He bade me on you press this one word—Think! Ye sprightly youths, quite flush with hope and spirit, Who think to storm the world by dint of merit, To you the dotard has a deal to say, In his sly, dry, sententious, proverb way! He bids you mind, amid your thoughtless rattle, That the first blow is ever half the battle; That, tho' some by the skirt may try to snatch him, Yet by the forelock is the hold to catch him; That, whether doing, suffering, or forbearing, You may do miracles by persevering. Last, tho' not least in love, ye youthful fair, Angelic forms, high Heaven's peculiar care! To you old Bald-Pate smoothes his wrinkled brow, And humbly begs you'll mind the important—Now! To crown your happiness he asks your leave, And offers bliss to give and to receive. For our sincere, tho' haply weak endeavours, With grateful pride we own your many favours; And howsoe'er our tongues may ill reveal it, Believe our glowing bosoms truly feel it. SCOTS PROLOGUE FOR MRS. SUTHERLAND ON HER BENEFIT-NIGHT AT THE THEATRE, DUMFRIES MARCH 3RD, 1790 What needs this din about the town o' Lon'on, How this new play an' that new song is comin? Why is outlandish stuff sae meikle courted? Does Nonsense mend like brandy—when imported? Is there nae poet, burning keen for fame, Will bauldly try to gie us plays at hame? For Comedy abroad he need na toil: A knave and fool are plants of every soil. Nor need he stray as far as Rome or Greece To gather matter for a serious piece: There's themes enow in Caledonian story Would show the tragic Muse in a' her glory. Is there no daring Bard will rise and tell How glorious Wallace stood, how hapless fell? Where are the Muses fled that could produce A drama worthy o' the name o' Bruce? How here, even here, he first unsheath'd the sword 'Gainst mighty England and her guilty lord, And after monie a bloody, deathless doing, Wrench'd his dear country from the jaws of Ruin! O, for a Shakespeare, or an Otway scene To paint the lovely, hapless Scottish Queen! Vain all th'omnipotence of female charms 'Gainst headlong, ruthless, mad Rebellion's arms! She fell, but fell with spirit truly Roman, To glut the vengeance of a rival woman: A woman (tho' the phrase may seem uncivil) As able—and as cruel—as the Devil! One Douglas lives in Home's immortal page, But Douglasses were heroes every age; And tho' your fathers, prodigal of life, A Douglas followed to the martial strife, Perhaps, if bowls row right, and Right succeeds, Ye yet may follow where a Douglas leads! As ye hae generous done, if a' the land Would take the Muses' servants by the hand; Not only hear, but patronize, befriend them, And where ye justly can commend, commend them; And aiblins, when they winna stand the test, Wink hard, and say: ‘The folks hae done their best!’ Would a' the land do this, then I'll be caition Ye'll soon hae Poets o' the Scottish nation Will gar Fame blaw until her trumpet crack, And warsle Time, an' lay him on his back! For us and for our stage, should onie spier:— ‘Whase aught thae chiels maks a' this bustle here?’ My best leg foremost, I'll set up my brow:— ‘We have the honor to belong to you!’ We're your ain bairns, e'en guide us as ye like, But like good mithers, shore before ye strike; And gratefu' still, I trust ye'll ever find us For gen'rous patronage and meikle kindness We've got frae a' professions, setts an' ranks: God help us! we're but poor—ye'se get but thanks! THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN An Occasional Address SPOKEN BY MISS FONTENELLE ON HER BENEFIT NIGHT NOVEMBER 26, 1792 While Europe's eye is fix'd on mighty things, The fate of empires and the fall of kings; While quacks of State must each produce his plan, And even children lisp the Rights of Man; Amid this mighty fuss just let me mention, The Rights of Woman merit some attention. First, in the sexes' intermix'd connexion One sacred Right of Woman is Protection: The tender flower, that lifts its head elate, Helpless must fall before the blasts of fate, Sunk on the earth, defac'd its lovely form, Unless your shelter ward th'impending storm. Our second Right—but needless here is caution— To keep that right inviolate's the fashion: Each man of sense has it so full before him, He'd die before he'd wrong it—'tis Decorum! There was, indeed, in far less polish'd days, A time, when rough rude Man had naughty ways: Would swagger, swear, get drunk, kick up a riot, Nay, even thus invade a lady's quiet! Now, thank our stars! these Gothic times are fled; Now, well-bred men—and you are all well-bred— Most justly think (and we are much the gainers) Such conduct neither spirit, wit, nor manners. For Right the third, our last, our best, our dearest: That right to fluttering female hearts the nearest, Which even the Rights of Kings, in low prostration, Most humbly own—'tis dear, dear Admiration! In that blest sphere alone we live and move; There taste that life of life—Immortal Love. Smiles, glances, sighs, tears, fits, flirtations, airs— 'Gainst such an host what flinty savage dares? When awful Beauty joins with all her charms, Who is so rash as rise in rebel arms? But truce with kings, and truce with constitutions, With bloody armaments and revolutions; Let Majesty your first attention summon: Ah! ça ira! the Majesty of Woman! ADDRESS SPOKEN BY MISS FONTENELLE ON HER BENEFIT NIGHT, DECEMBER 4TH, 1793, AT THE THEATRE, DUMFRIES Still anxious to secure your partial favor, And not less anxious, sure, this night than ever, A Prologue, Epilogue, or some such matter, 'Twould vamp my bill, said I, if nothing better: So sought a Poet roosted near the skies; Told him I came to feast my curious eyes; Said, nothing like his works was ever printed; And last, my prologue-business slily hinted. ‘Ma'am, let me tell you,” quoth my man of rhymes, ‘I know your bent—these are no laughing times: Can you—but, Miss, I own I have my fears— Dissolve in pause, and sentimental tears? With laden sighs, and solemn-rounded sentence, Rouse from his sluggish slumbers, fell Repentance? Paint Vengeance, as he takes his horrid stand, Waving on high the desolating brand, Calling the storms to bear him o'er a guilty land?’ I could no more! Askance the creature eyeing:— ‘D'ye think,’ said I, ‘this face was made for crying? I'll laugh, that's poz—nay more, the world shall know it; And so, your servant! gloomy Master Poet!’ Firm as my creed, Sirs, 'tis my fix'd belief That Misery's another word for Grief. I also think (so may I be a bride!) That so much laughter, so much life enjoy'd. Thou man of crazy care and ceaseless sigh, Still under bleak Misfortune's blasting eye; Doom'd to that sorest task of man alive— To make three guineas do the work of five; Laugh in Misfortune's face—the beldam witch— Say, you 'll be merry, tho' you can't be rich! Thou other man of care, the wretch in love! Who long with jiltish arts and airs hast strove; Who, as the boughs all temptingly project, Measur'st in desperate thought—a rope—thy neck— Or, where the beetling cliff o'erhangs the deep, Peerest to meditate the healing leap: Would'st thou be cur'd, thou silly, moping elf? Laugh at her follies, laugh e'en at thyself; Learn to despise those frowns now so terrific, And love a kinder: that's your grand specific. To sum up all: be merry, I advise; And as we're merry, may we still be wise! POLITICAL PIECES ADDRESS OF BEELZEBUB To the Right Honorable the Earl of Breadalbane, President of the Right Honorable the Highland Society, which met on the 23rd of May last, at the Shakespeare, Covent Garden, to concert ways and means to frustrate the designs of five hundred Highlanders who, as the Society were informed by Mr. M'Kenzie of Applecross, were so audacious as to attempt an escape from their lawful lords and masters whose property they were, by emigrating from the lands of Mr. Macdonald of Glengary to the wilds of Canada, in search of that fantastic thing—Liberty. Long life, my lord, an' health be yours, Unskaith'd by hunger'd Highland boors! Lord grant nae duddie, desperate beggar, Wi' dirk, claymore, or rusty trigger, May twin auld Scotland o' a life She likes—as lambkins like a knife! Faith! you and Applecross were right To keep the Highland hounds in sight! I doubt na! they wad bid nae better Than let them ance out owre the water! Then up amang thae lakes and seas, They'll mak what rules and laws they please: Some daring Hancock, or a Franklin, May set their Highland bluid a-ranklin; Some Washington again may head them, Or some Montgomerie, fearless, lead them; Till (God knows what may be effected When by such heads and hearts directed) Poor dunghill sons of dirt an' mire May to Patrician rights aspire! Nae sage North now, nor sager Sackville, To watch and premier owre the pack vile! An' whare will ye get Howes and Clintons To bring them to a right repentance? To cowe the rebel generation, An' save the honor o' the nation? They, an' be damn'd! what right hae they To meat or sleep or light o' day, Far less to riches, pow'r, or freedom, But what your lordship likes to gie them? But hear, my lord! Glengary, hear! Your hand's owre light on them, I fear: Your factors, grieves, trustees, and bailies, I canna say but they do gaylies: They lay aside a' tender mercies, An' tirl the hullions to the birses. Yet while they're only poind and herriet, They'll keep their stubborn Highland spirit. But smash them! crush them a' to spails, An' rot the dyvors i' the jails! The young dogs, swinge them to the labour: Let wark an' hunger mak them sober! The hizzies, if they're aughtlins fawsont, Let them in Drury Lane be lesson'd! An' if the wives an' dirty brats Come thiggin at your doors an' yetts, Flaffin wi' duds an' grey wi' beas', Frightin awa your deuks an' geese, Get out a horsewhip or a jowler, The langest thong, the fiercest growler, An' gar the tatter'd gypsies pack Wi' a' their bastards on their back! Go on, my Lord! I lang to meet you, An' in my ‘house at hame’ to greet you. Wi' common lords ye shanna mingle: The benmost neuk beside the ingle, At my right han' assigned your seat 'Tween Herod's hip an' Polycrate, Or (if you on your station tarrow) Between Almagro and Pizarro, A seat, I'm sure ye're weel deservin't; An' till ye come—your humble servant, Beelzebub. Hell, 1st June, Anno Mundi 5790 BIRTHDAY ODE FOR 31ST DECEMBER 1787 Afar the illustrious Exile roams, Whom kingdoms on this day should hail, An inmate in the casual shed, On transient pity's bounty fed, Haunted by busy Memory's bitter tale! Beasts of the forest have their savage homes, But He, who should imperial purple wear, Owns not the lap of earth where rests his royal head: His wretched refuge dark despair, While ravening wrongs and woes pursue, And distant far the faithful few Who would his sorrows share! False flatterer, Hope, away, Nor think to lure us as in days of yore! We solemnize this sorrowing natal day, To prove our loyal truth—we can no more— And, owning Heaven's mysterious sway, Submissive, low, adore. Ye honor'd, mighty Dead, Who nobly perish'd in the glorious cause, Your King, your Country, and her laws: From great Dundee, who smiling Victory led And fell a Martyr in her arms (What breast of northern ice but warms!), To bold Balmerino's undying name, Whose soul of fire, lighted at Heaven's high flame, Deserves the proudest wreath departed heroes claim! Not unrevenged your fate shall lie, It only lags, the fatal hour: Your blood shall with incessant cry Awake at last th'unsparing Power. As from the cliff, with thundering course, The snowy ruin smokes along With doubling speed and gathering force, Till deep it, crushing, whelms the cottage in the vale, So Vengeance' arm, ensanguin'd, strong, Shall with resistless might assail, Usurping Brunswick's pride shall lay, And Stewart's wrongs and yours with tenfold weight repay. Perdition, baleful child of night, Rise and revenge the injured right Of Stewart's royal race! Lead on the unmuzzled hounds of Hell, Till all the frighted echoes tell The blood-notes of the chase! Full on the quarry point their view, Full on the base usurping crew, The tools of faction and the nation's curse! Hark how the cry grows on the wind; They leave the lagging gale behind; Their savage fury, pityless, they pour; With murdering eyes already they devour! See Brunswick spent, a wretched prey, His life one poor despairing day, Where each avenging hour still ushers in a worse! Such Havoc, howling all abroad, Their utter ruin bring, The base apostates to their God Or rebels to their King! ODE TO THE DEPARTED REGENCY BILL Daughter of Chaos' doting years, Nurse of ten thousand hopes and fears! Whether thy airy, unsubstantial shade (The rights of sepulture now duly paid) Spread abroad its hideous form On the roaring civil storm, Deafening din and warring rage Factions wild with factions wage; Or Underground Deep-sunk, profound Among the demons of the earth, With groans that make The mountains shake Thou mourn thy ill-starr'd blighted birth; Or in the uncreated Void, Where seeds of future being fight, With lighten'd step thou wander wide To greet thy mother—Ancient Night— And as each jarring monster-mass is past, Fond recollect what once thou wast: In manner due, beneath this sacred oak, Hear, Spirit, hear! thy presence I invoke! By a Monarch's heaven-struck fate; By a disunited State; By a generous Prince's wrongs; By a Senate's war of tongues; By a Premier's sullen pride Louring on the changing tide; By dread Thurlow's powers to awe— Rhetoric, blasphemy and law; By the turbulent ocean, A Nation's commotion; By the harlot-caresses Of Borough addresses; By days few and evil; (Thy portion, poor devil!), By Power, Wealth, and Show—the Gods by men adored; By nameless Poverty their Hell abhorred; By all they hope, by all they fear, Hear! and Appear! Stare not on me, thou ghostly Power, Nor, grim with chain'd defiance, lour! No Babel-structure would I build Where, Order exil'd from his native sway, Confusion might the Regent-sceptre wield, While all would rule and none obey. Go, to the world of Man relate The story of thy sad, eventful fate; And call presumptuous Hope to hear And bid him check his blind career; And tell the sore-prest sons of Care Never, never to despair! Paint Charles's speed on wings of fire, The object of his fond desire, Beyond his boldest hopes, at hand. Paint all the triumph of the Portland Band (Hark! how they lift the joy-exulting voice, And how their num'rous creditors rejoice!); But just as hopes to warm enjoyment rise, Cry ‘Convalescence!’ and the vision flies. Then next pourtray a dark'ning twilight gloom Eclipsing sad a gay, rejoicing morn, While proud Ambition to th'untimely tomb By gnashing, grim, despairing fiends is borne! Paint Ruin, in the shape of high Dundas Gaping with giddy terror o'er the brow: In vain he struggles, the Fates behind him press, And clamorous Hell yawns for her prey below! How fallen That, whose pride late scaled the skies! And This, like Lucifer, no more to rise! Again pronounce the powerful word: See Day, triumphant from the night, restored! Then know this truth, ye Sons of Men (Thus ends thy moral tale): Your darkest terrors may be vain, Your brightest hopes may fail! A NEW PSALM FOR THE CHAPEL OF KILMARNOCK ON THE THANKSGIVING-DAY FOR HIS MAJESTY'S RECOVERY I O, sing a new song to the Lord! Make, all and every one, A joyful noise, ev'n for the King His restoration! II The sons of Belial in the land Did set their heads together. ‘Come, let us sweep them off,’ said they, ‘Like an o'erflowing river!’ III They set their heads together, I say, They set their heads together: On right, and left, and every hand, We saw none to deliver. IV Thou madest strong two chosen ones, To quell the Wicked's pride: That Young Man, great in Issachar, The burden-bearing tribe; V And him, among the Princes, chief In our Jerusalem, The Judge that's mighty in Thy law, The man that fears Thy name. VI Yet they, even they with all their strength, Began to faint and fail; Even as two howling, rav'ning wolves To dogs do turn their tail. VII Th'ungodly o'er the just prevail'd; For so Thou hadst appointed, That Thou might'st greater glory give Unto Thine own anointed! VIII And now Thou hast restored our State, Pity our Kirk also; For she by tribulations Is now brought very low! IX Consume that high-place, Patronage, From off Thy holy hill; And in Thy fury burn the book Even of that man M'Gill! X Now hear our prayer, accept our song, And fight Thy chosen's battle! We seek but little, Lord, from Thee: Thou kens we get as little! INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HON. C. J. FOX How Wisdom and Folly meet, mix, and unite, How Virtue and Vice blend their black and their white, How Genius, th'illustrious father of fiction, Confounds rule and law, reconciles contradiction, I sing. If these mortals, the critics, should bustle, I care not, not I: let the critics go whistle! But now for a Patron, whose name and whose glory At once may illústrate and honor my story:— Thou first of our orators, first of our wits, Yet whose parts and acquirements seem mere lucky hits; With knowledge so vast and with judgment so strong, No man with the half of 'em e'er could go wrong; With passions so potent and fancies so bright, No man with the half of 'em e'er could go right; A sorry, poor, misbegot son of the Muses, For using thy name, offers fifty excuses. Good Lord, what is Man! For as simple he looks, Do but try to develop his hooks and his crooks! With his depths and his shallows, his good and his evil, All in all he's a problem must puzzle the Devil. On his one ruling passion Sir Pope hugely labors, That, like th'old Hebrew walking-switch, eats up its neighbours. Human Nature's his show-box—your friend, would you know him? Pull the string, Ruling Passion—the picture will show him. What pity, in rearing so beauteous a system, One trifling particular—Truth—should have miss'd him! For, spite of his fine theoretic positions, Mankind is a science defies definitions. Some sort all our qualities each to its tribe, And think Human Nature they truly describe: Have you found this, or t'other? There's more in the wind, As by one drunken fellow his comrades you'll find. But such is the flaw, or the depth of the plan In the make of that wonderful creature called Man, No two virtues, whatever relation they claim, Nor even two different shades of the same, Though like as was ever twin brother to brother, Possessing the one shall imply you've the other. But truce with abstraction, and truce with a Muse Whose rhymes you'll perhaps, Sir, ne'er deign to peruse! Will you leave your justings, your jars, and your quarrels, Contending with Billy for proud-nodding laurels? My much-honour'd Patron, believe your poor Poet, Your courage much more than your prudence, you show it. In vain with Squire Billy for laurels you struggle: He'll have them by fair trade—if not, he will smuggle; Nor cabinets even of kings would conceal 'em, He'd up the back-stairs, and by God he would steal 'em! Then feats like Squire Billy's, you ne'er can achieve 'em; It is not, out-do him—the task is, out-thieve him! ON GLENRIDDELL'S FOX BREAKING HIS CHAIN A FRAGMENT, 1791 Thou, Liberty, thou art my theme: Not such as idle poets dream, Who trick thee up a heathen goddess That a fantastic cap and rod has! Such stale conceits are poor and silly: I paint thee out a Highland filly, A sturdy, stubborn, handsome dapple, As sleek's a mouse, as round's an apple, That, when thou pleasest, can do wonders, But when thy luckless rider blunders, Or if thy fancy should demur there, Wilt break thy neck ere thou go further. These things premis'd, I sing a Fox— Was caught among his native rocks, And to a dirty kennel chained— How he his liberty regained. Glenriddell! a Whig without a stain, A Whig in principle and grain, Could'st thou enslave a free-born creature, A native denizen of Nature? How could'st thou, with a heart so good (A better ne'er was sluiced with blood), Nail a poor devil to a tree, That ne'er did harm to thine or thee? The staunchest Whig Glenriddell was, Quite frantic in his country's cause; And oft was Reynard's prison passing, And with his brother-Whigs canvássing The rights of men, the powers of women, With all the dignity of Freemen. Sir Reynard daily heard debates Of princes', kings', and nations' fates, With many rueful, bloody stories Of tyrants, Jacobites, and Tories: From liberty how angels fell, That now are galley-slaves in Hell; How Nimrod first the trade began Of binding Slavery's chains on man; How fell Semiramis—God damn her!— Did first, with sacrilegious hammer (All ills till then were trivial matters) For Man dethron'd forge hen-peck fetters; How Xerxes, that abandoned Tory, Thought cutting throats was reaping glory, Until the stubborn Whigs of Sparta Taught him great Nature's Magna Charta; How mighty Rome her fiat hurl'd Resistless o'er a bowing world, And, kinder than they did desire, Polish'd mankind with sword and fire: With much too tedious to relate Of ancient and of modern date, But ending still how Billy Pitt (Unlucky boy!) with wicked wit Has gagg'd old Britain, drained her coffer, As butchers bind and bleed a heifer. Thus wily Reynard, by degrees In kennel listening at his ease, Suck'd in a mighty stock of knowledge, As much as some folks at a college; Knew Britain's rights and constitution, Her aggrandisement, diminution; How Fortune wrought us good from evil: Let no man, then, despise the Devil, As who should say: ‘I ne'er can need him,’ Since we to scoundrels owe our Freedom. ON THE COMMEMORATION OF RODNEY'S VICTORY KING'S ARMS, DUMFRIES, 12TH APRIL 1793 Instead of a song, boys, I'll give you a toast: Here's the Mem'ry of those on the Twelfth that we lost!— We lost, did I say?—No, by Heav'n, that we found! For their fame it shall live while the world goes round. The next in succession I'll give you: the King! And who would betray him, on high may he swing! And here's the grand fabric, our Free Constitution As built on the base of the great Revolution! And, longer with Politics not to be cramm'd, Be Anarchy curs'd, and be Tyranny damn'd! And who would to Liberty e'er prove disloyal, May his son be a hangman—and he his first trial! ODE FOR GENERAL WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY No Spartan tube, no Attic shell, No lyre Æolian I awake. 'Tis Liberty's bold note I swell: Thy harp, Columbia, let me take! See gathering thousands, while I sing, A broken chain, exulting, bring And dash it in a tyrant's face, And dare him to his very beard, And tell him he no more is fear'd, No more the despot of Columbia's race! A tyrant's proudest insults brav'd, They shout a People freed! They hail an Empire sav'd! Where is man's godlike form? Where is that brow erect and bold, That eye that can unmov'd behold The wildest rage, the loudest storm That e'er created Fury dared to raise? Avaunt! thou caitiff, servile, base, That tremblest at a despot's nod, Yet, crouching under the iron rod, Canst laud the arm that struck th'insulting blow! Art thou of man's Imperial line? Dost boast that countenance divine? Each skulking feature answers: No! But come, ye sons of Liberty, Columbia's offspring, brave as free, In danger's hour still flaming in the van, Ye know, and dare maintain the Royalty of Man! Alfred, on thy starry throne Surrounded by the tuneful choir, The Bards that erst have struck the patriot lyre, And rous'd the freeborn Briton's soul of fire, No more thy England own! Dare injured nations form the great design To make detested tyrants bleed? Thy England execrates the glorious deed! Beneath her hostile banners waving, Every pang of honour braving, England in thunder calls: ‘The Tyrant's cause is mine!’ That hour accurst how did the fiends rejoice, And Hell thro' all her confines raise th'exulting voice! That hour which saw the generous English name Link't with such damnèd deeds of everlasting shame! Thee, Caledonia, thy wild heaths among, Fam'd for the martial deed, the heaven-taught song, To thee I turn with swimming eyes! Where is that soul of Freedom fled? Immingled with the mighty dead Beneath that hallow'd turf where Wallace lies! Hear it not, Wallace, in thy bed of death! Ye babbling winds, in silence sweep! Disturb not ye the hero's sleep, Nor give the coward secret breath! Is this the ancient Caledonian form, Firm as her rock, resistless as her storm? Show me that eye which shot immortal hate, Blasting the Despot's proudest bearing! Show me that arm which, nerv'd with thundering fate, Crush'd Usurpation's boldest daring! Dark-quench'd as yonder sinking star, No more that glance lightens afar, That palsied arm no more whirls on the waste of war. THE FÊTE CHAMPETRE Tune: Killiecrankie I O, wha will to Saint Stephen's House, To do our errands there, man? O, wha will to Saint Stephen's House O' th'merry lads of Ayr, man? Or will ye send a man o' law? Or will ye send a sodger? Or him wha led o'er Scotland a' The meikle Ursa-Major? II Come, will ye court a noble lord, Or buy a score o' lairds, man? For Worth and Honour pawn their word, Their vote shall be Glencaird's, man. Ane gies them coin, ane gies them wine, Anither gies them clatter; Annbank, wha guess'd the ladies' taste, He gies a Fête Champetre. III When Love and Beauty heard the news The gay green-woods amang, man, Where, gathering flowers and busking bowers, They heard the blackbird's sang, man A vow, they seal'd it with a kiss, Sir Politics to fetter: As theirs alone the patent bliss To hold a Fête Champetre. IV Then mounted Mirth on gleesome wing, O'er hill and dale she flew, man; Ilk wimpling burn, ilk crystal spring, Ilk glen and shaw she knew, man. She summon'd every social sprite, That sports by wood or water, On th'bonie banks of Ayr to meet And keep this Fête Champetre. V Cauld Boreas wi' his boisterous crew Were bound to stakes like kye, man; And Cynthia's car, o' silver fu', Clamb up the starry sky, man: Reflected beams dwell in the streams, Or down the current shatter; The western breeze steals through the trees To view this Fête Champetre. VI How many a robe sae gaily floats, What sparkling jewels glance, man, To Harmony's enchanting notes, As moves the mazy dance, man! The echoing wood, the winding flood Like Paradise did glitter, When angels met at Adam's yett To hold their Fête Champetre. VII When Politics came there to mix And make his ether-stane, man, He circled round the magic ground, But entrance found he nane, man: He blush'd for shame, he quat his name, Forswore it every letter, Wi' humble prayer to join and share This festive Fête Champetre. THE FIVE CARLINS Tune: Chevy Chase I There was five carlins in the South: They fell upon a scheme To send a lad to Lon'on town To bring them tidings hame: II Nor only bring them tidings hame, But do their errands there: And aiblins gowd and honor baith Might be that laddie's share. III There was Maggie by the banks o' Nith, A dame wi' pride eneugh; And Marjorie o' the Monie Lochs, A carlin auld and teugh; IV And Blinkin Bess of Annandale, That dwelt near Solway-side; And Brandy Jean, that took her gill In Galloway sae wide; V And Black Joán, frae Crichton Peel, O' gipsy kith an' kin: Five wighter carlins were na found The South countrie within. VI To send a lad to London town They met upon a day; And monie a knight and monie a laird This errand fain wad gae. VII O, monie a knight and monie a laird This errand fain wad gae; But nae ane could their fancy please, O, ne'er a ane but tway! VIII The first ane was a belted Knight, Bred of a Border band; And he wad gae to London Town, Might nae man him withstand; IX And he wad do their errands weel, And meikle he wad say; And ilka ane at London court Wad bid to him guid-day. X The neist cam in, a Soger boy, And spak wi' modest grace; And he wad gae to London Town, If sae their pleasure was. XI He wad na hecht them courtly gifts, Nor meikle speech pretend; But he wad hecht an honest heart Wad ne'er desert his friend. XII Now wham to chuse and wham refuse At strife thae carlins fell; For some had gentle folk to please, And some wad please themsel. XIII Then out spak mim-mou'd Meg o' Nith, And she spak up wi' pride, And she wad send the Soger lad, Whatever might betide. XIV For the auld Guidman o' London court She didna care a pin; But she wad send the Soger lad To greet his eldest son. XV Then up sprang Bess o' Annandale, And swore a deadly aith, Says:—‘I will send the belted Knight, Spite of you carlins baith! XVI ‘For far-aff fowls hae feathers fair, And fools o' change are fain; But I hae tried this Border Knight: I'll try him yet again.’ XVII Then Brandy Jean spak owre her drink:— ‘Ye weel ken, kimmers a’, The auld Guidman o' London court, His back's been at the wa'; XVIII ‘And monie a friend that kiss'd his caup Is now a fremit wight; But it's ne'er be sae wi' Brandy Jean— I'll send the Border Knight.’ XIX Says Black Joán frae Crichton Peel, A carlin stoor and grim:— ‘The auld Guidman or the young Guidman For me may sink or swim! XX ‘For fools will prate o' right or wrang, While knaves laugh in their slieve; But wha blaws best the horn shall win— I'll spier nae courtier's leave!’ XXI Then slow raise Marjorie o' the Lochs, And wrinkled was her brow, Her ancient weed was russet gray, Her auld Scots heart was true:— XXII ‘There's some great folk set light by me, I set as light by them; But I will send to London town Wham I lo'e best at hame.’ XXIII Sae how this sturt and strife may end, There's naebody can tell. God grant the King and ilka man May look weel to themsel! ELECTION BALLAD FOR WESTERHA' Up and waur them a', Jamie, Up and waur them a'! The Johnstones hae the guidin o't: Ye turncoat Whigs, awa! I The Laddies by the banks o' Nith Wad trust his Grace wi' a', Jamie; But he'll sair them as he sair'd the King— Turn tail and rin awa, Jamie. II The day he stude his country's friend, Or gied her faes a claw, Jamie, Or frae puir man a blessin wan— That day the Duke ne'er saw, Jamie. III But wha is he, his country's boast? Like him there is na twa, Jamie! There's no a callant tents the kye But kens o' Westerha', Jamie. IV To end the wark, here's Whistlebirk— Lang may his whistle blaw, Jamie!— And Maxwell true, o' sterling blue, And we'll be Johnstones a', Jamie. Up and waur them a', Jamie, Up and waur them a'! The Johnstones hae the guidin o't: Ye turncoat Whigs, awa! ELECTION BALLAD AT CLOSE OF THE CONTEST FOR REPRESENTING THE DUMFRIES BURGHS, 1790 Addressed to Robert Graham of Fintry I Fintry, my stay in worldly strife, Friend o' my Muse, friend o' my life, Are ye as idle's I am? Come then! Wi' uncouth kintra fleg O'er Pegasus I'll fling my leg, And ye shall see me try him! II But where shall I gae rin or ride, That I may splatter nane beside? I wad na be uncivil: In mankind's various paths and ways There's ay some doytin body strays, And I ride like a devil. III Thus I break aff wi' a' my birr, An' down yon dark, deep alley spur, Where Theologies dander: Alas! curst wi' eternal fogs, And damn'd in everlasting bogs, As sure's the Creed I'll blunder! IV I'll stain a band, or jaup a gown, Or rin my reckless, guilty crown Against the haly door! Sair do I rue my luckless fate, When, as the Muse an' Deil wad hae't, I rade that road before! V Suppose I take a spurt, and mix Amang the wilds o' Politics— Electors and elected— Where dogs at Court (sad sons o' bitches!) Septennially a madness touches, Till all the land's infected? VI All hail, Drumlanrig's haughty Grace, Discarded remnant of a race Once godlike—great in story! Thy fathers' virtues all contrasted, The very name of Douglas blasted, Thine that inverted glory! VII Hate, envy, oft the Douglas bore; But thou hast superadded more, And sunk them in contempt! Follies and crimes have stain'd the name; But, Queensberry, thine the virgin claim, From aught that's good exempt! VIII I'll sing the zeal Drumlanrig bears, Who left the all-important cares Of fiddlers, whores, and hunters, And, bent on buying Borough Towns, Came shaking hands wi' wabster-loons, And kissing barefit bunters. IX Combustion thro' our boroughs rode, Whistling his roaring pack abroad Of mad unmuzzled lions, As Queensberry buff-and-blue unfurl'd, And Westerha' and Hopeton hurl'd To every Whig defiance. X But cautious Queensberry left the war (Th'unmanner'd dust might soil his star; Besides, he hated bleeding), But left behind him heroes bright, Heroes in Cæsarean fight Or Ciceronian pleading. XI O, for a throat like huge Mons-Meg, To muster o'er each ardent Whig Beneath Drumlanrig's banner! Heroes and heroines commix, All in the field of politics, To win immortal honor! XII M'Murdo and his lovely spouse (Th'enamour'd laurels kiss her brows!) Led on the Loves and Graces: She won each gaping burgess' heart, While he, sub rosâ, played his part Among their wives and lasses. XIII Craigdarroch led a light-arm'd core: Tropes, metaphors, and figures pour, Like Hecla streaming thunder. Glenriddell, skill'd in rusty coins, Blew up each Tory's dark designs And bared the treason under. XIV In either wing two champions fought: Redoubted Staig, who set at nought The wildest savage Tory; And Welsh, who ne'er yet flinch'd his ground, High-wav'd his magnum-bonum round With Cyclopeian fury. XV Miller brought up th'artillery ranks, The many-pounders of the Banks, Resistless desolation! While Maxwelton, that baron bold, 'Mid Lawson's port entrench'd his hold And threaten'd worse damnation. XVI To these what Tory hosts oppos'd, With these what Tory warriors clos'd, Surpasses my descriving: Squadrons, extended long and large, With furious speed rush to the charge, Like furious devils driving. XVII What verse can sing, what prose narrate The butcher deeds of bloody Fate Amid this mighty tulyie? Grim Horror girn'd, pale Terror roar'd, As Murther at his thrapple shor'd, And Hell mix'd in the brulyie. XVIII As Highland craigs by thunder cleft, When lightnings fire the stormy lift, Hurl down with crashing rattle, As flames among a hundred woods, As headlong foam a hundred floods— Such is the rage of Battle! XIX The stubborn Tories dare to die: As soon the rooted oaks would fly Before th'approaching fellers! The Whigs come on like Ocean's roar, When all his wintry billows pour Against the Buchan Bullers. XX Lo, from the shades of Death's deep night Departed Whigs enjoy the fight, And think on former daring! The muffled murtherer of Charles The Magna Charter flag unfurls, All deadly gules its bearing. XXI Nor wanting ghosts of Tory fame: Bold Scrimgeour follows gallant Graham, Auld Covenanters shiver . . . Forgive! forgive! much-wrong'd Montrose! Now Death and Hell engulph thy foes, Thou liv'st on high for ever! XXII Still o'er the field the combat burns; The Tories, Whigs, give way by turns; But Fate the word has spoken; For woman's wit and strength o' man, Alas! can do but what they can: The Tory ranks are broken. XXIII O, that my een were flowing burns! My voice a lioness that mourns Her darling cubs' undoing That I might greet, that I might cry, While Tories fall, while Tories fly From furious Whigs pursuing! XXIV What Whig but melts for good Sir James, Dear to his country by the names, Friend, Patron, Benefactor? Not Pulteney's wealth can Pulteney save; And Hopeton falls—the generous, brave!— And Stewart bold as Hector. XXV Thou, Pitt, shalt rue this overthrow, And Thurlow growl this curse of woe, And Melville melt in wailing! Now Fox and Sheridan rejoice, And Burke shall sing:—‘O Prince, arise! Thy power is all prevailing!’ XXVI For your poor friend, the Bard, afar He sees and hears the distant war, A cool spectator purely: So, when the storm the forest rends, The robin in the hedge descends, And, patient, chirps securely. XXVII Now, for my friends' and brethren's sakes, And for my dear-lov'd Land o' Cakes, I pray with holy fire:— Lord, send a rough-shod troop o' Hell O'er a' wad Scotland buy or sell, To grind them in the mire! BALLADS ON MR. HERON'S ELECTION, 1795 BALLAD FIRST I Wham will we send to London town, To Parliament and a' that? Or wha in a' the country round The best deserves to fa' that? For a' that, and a' that, Thro' Galloway and a' that, Where is the Laird or belted Knight That best deserves to fa' that? II Wha sees Kerroughtree's open yett— And wha is 't never saw that?— Wha ever wi' Kerroughtree met, And has a doubt of a' that? For a' that, and a' that, Here's Heron yet for a' that! The independent patriot, The honest man, and a' that! III Tho' wit and worth, in either sex, Saint Mary's Isle can shaw that, Wi' Lords and Dukes let Selkirk mix, And weel does Selkirk fa' that. For a' that, and a' that, Here's Heron yet for a' that! An independent commoner Shall be the man for a' that. IV But why should we to Nobles jeuk, And it against the law, that, And even a Lord may be a gowk, Wi' ribban, star, and a' that? For a' that, and a' that, Here's Heron yet for a' that! A Lord may be a lousy loon, Wi' ribban, star, and a' that. V A beardless boy comes o'er the hills Wi's uncle's purse and a' that; But we'll hae ane frae 'mang oursels, A man we ken, and a' that. For a' that, and a' that, Here's Heron yet for a' that! We are na to be bought and sold, Like nowte, and naigs, and a' that. VI Then let us drink:—‘The Stewartry, Kerroughtree's laird, and a' that, Our representative to be’: For weel he's worthy a' that! For a' that, and a' that, Here's Heron yet for a' that! A House of Commons such as he, They wad be blest that saw that. BALLAD SECOND: THE ELECTION Tune: Fy, Let Us A' to The Bridal I Fy, let us a' to Kirkcudbright, For there will be bickerin there; For Murray's light horse are to muster, An' O, how the heroes will swear! And there will be Murray commander, An' Gordon the battle to win: Like brothers, they'll stan' by each other, Sae knit in alliance and kin. II An' there'll be black-nebbit Johnie, The tongue o' the trump to them a': Gin he get na Hell for his haddin, The Deil gets nae justice ava! And there'll be Kempleton's birkie, A boy no sae black at the bane; But as to his fine nabob fortune— We'll e'en let the subject alane! III An' there'll be Wigton's new sheriff— Dame Justice fu' brawly has sped: She's gotten the heart of a Bushby, But Lord! what's become o' the head? An' there'll be Cardoness, Esquire, Sae mighty in Cardoness' eyes: A wight that will weather damnation, For the Devil the prey would despise. IV An' there'll be Douglasses doughty, New christening towns far and near: Abjuring their democrat doings An' kissing the arse of a peer! An' there'll be Kenmure sae generous, Wha's honor is proof to the storm: To save them from stark reprobation He lent them his name to the firm! V But we winna mention Redcastle, The body—e'en let him escape! He'd venture the gallows for siller, An' 'twere na the cost o' the rape! An' whare is our King's Lord Lieutenant, Sae famed for his gratefu' return? The billie is getting his Questions To say at St. Stephen's the morn! VI An' there'll be lads o' the gospel: Muirhead, wha's as guid as he's true; An' there'll be Buittle's Apostle, Wha's mair o' the black than the blue; An' there'll be folk frae St. Mary's, A house o' great merit and note: The Deil ane but honors them highly, The Deil ane will gie them his vote! VII An' there'll be wealthy young Richard, Dame Fortune should hang by the neck: But for prodigal thriftless bestowing, His merit had won him respect. An' there'll be rich brither nabobs; Tho' nabobs, yet men o' the first! An' there'll be Collieston's whiskers, An' Quinton—o' lads no the warst! VIII An' there'll be Stamp-Office Johnie: Tak tent how ye purchase a dram! An' there'll be gay Cassencarry, An' there'll be Colonel Tam; An' there'll be trusty Kerroughtree, Wha's honour was ever his law: If the virtues were pack't in a parcel, His worth might be sample for a'! IX An' can we forget the auld Major, Wha'll ne'er be forgot in the Greys? Our flatt'ry we'll keep for some other: Him only it's justice to praise! An' there'll be maiden Kilkerran, An' also Barskimming's guid Knight. An' there'll be roaring Birtwhistle— Yet luckily roars in the right! X An' there frae the Niddlesdale border Will mingle the Maxwells in droves: Teuch Johnie, Staunch Geordie, and Wattie That girns for the fishes an' loaves! An' there'll be Logan's M'Doual— Sculdudd'ry an' he will be there! An' also the wild Scot o' Galloway, Sogering, gunpowther Blair! XI Then hey the chaste interest of Broughton. An' hey for the blessings 'twill bring! It may send Balmaghie to the Commons— In Sodom 'twould mak him a King! An' hey for the sanctified Murray Our land wha wi' chapels has stor'd; He founder'd his horse among harlots, But gie'd the auld naig to the Lord! BALLAD THIRD JOHN BUSHBY'S LAMENTATION Tune: Babes In the Wood I 'Twas in the Seventeen Hunder year O' grace, and Ninety-Five, That year I was the wae'est man Of onie man alive. II In March the three-an'-twentieth morn, The sun raise clear an' bright; But O, I was a waefu' man, Ere to-fa' o' the night! III Yerl Galloway lang did rule this land Wi' equal right and fame, Fast knit in chaste and holy bands With Broughton's noble name. IV Yerl Galloway's man o' men was I, And chief o' Broughton's host: So twa blind beggars, on a string, The faithfu' tyke will trust! V But now Yerl Galloway's sceptre's broke, And Broughton's wi' the slain, And I my ancient craft may try, Sin' honesty is gane. VI 'Twas by the banks o' bonie Dee, Beside Kirkcudbright's towers, The Stewart and the Murray there Did muster a' their powers. VII Then Murray on the auld grey yaud Wi' wingèd spurs did ride: That auld grey yaud a' Nidsdale rade, He staw upon Nidside. VIII An' there had na been the Yerl himsel, O, there had been nae play! But Garlies was to London gane, And sae the kye might stray. IX And there was Balmaghie, I ween— In front rank he wad shine; But Balmaghie had better been Drinkin' Madeira wine. X And frae Glenkens cam to our aid A chief o' doughty deed: In case that worth should wanted be, O' Kenmure we had need. XI And by our banners march'd Muirhead, And Buittle was na slack, Whase haly priesthood nane could stain, For wha could dye the black? XII And there was grave Squire Cardoness, Look'd on till a' was done: Sae in the tower o' Cardoness A howlet sits at noon. XIII And there led I the Bushby clan: My gamesome billie, Will, And my son Maitland, wise as brave, My footsteps follow'd still. XIV The Douglas and the Heron's name, We set nought to their score; The Douglas and the Heron's name Had felt our weight before. XV But Douglasses o' weight had we: The pair o' lusty lairds, For building cot-houses sae fam'd, And christenin kail-yards. XVI And then Redcastle drew his sword That ne'er was stain'd wi' gore Save on a wand'rer lame and blind, To drive him frae his door. XVII And last cam creepin Collieston, Was mair in fear than wrath; Ae knave was constant in his mind— To keep that knave frae scaith. BALLAD FOURTH: THE TROGGER Tune: Buy Broom Besoms Chorus Buy braw troggin Frae the banks o' Dee! Wha wants troggin Let him come to me! I Wha will buy my troggin, Fine election ware, Broken trade o' Broughton, A' in high repair? II There's a noble Earl's Fame and high renown, For an auld sang—it's thought The guids were stown. III Here's the worth o' Broughton In a needle's e'e. Here's a reputation Tint by Balmaghie. IV Here's its stuff and lining, Cardoness's head— Fine for a soger, A' the wale o' lead. V Here's a little wadset— Buittle's scrap o' truth, Pawn'd in a gin-shop, Quenching holy drouth. VI Here's an honest conscience Might a prince adorn, Frae the downs o' Tinwald— So was never worn! VII Here's armorial bearings Frae the manse o' Urr: The crest, a sour crab-apple Rotten at the core. VIII Here is Satan's picture, Like a bizzard gled Pouncing poor Redcastle, Sprawlin like a taed. IX Here's the font where Douglas Stane and mortar names, Lately used at Caily Christening Murray's crimes. X Here's the worth and wisdom Collieston can boast: By a thievish midge They had been nearly lost. XI Here is Murray's fragments O' the Ten Commands, Gifted by Black Jock To get them aff his hands. XII Saw ye e'er sic troggin?— If to buy ye're slack, Hornie's turnin chapman: He'll buy a' the pack! Chorus Buy braw troggin Frae the banks o' Dee! Wha wants troggin Let him come to me! THE DEAN OF THE FACULTY A NEW BALLAD Tune: The Dragon of Wantley I Dire was the hate at Old Harlaw That Scot to Scot did carry; And dire the discord Langside saw For beauteous, hapless Mary. But Scot to Scot ne'er met so hot, Or were more in fury seen, Sir, Than 'twixt Hal and Bob for the famous job, Who should be the Faculty's Dean, Sir. II This Hal for genius, wit, and lore Among the first was number'd; But pious Bob, 'mid learning's store Commandment the Tenth remember'd. Yet simple Bob the victory got, And won his heart's desire: Which shows that Heaven can boil the pot, Tho' the Deil piss in the fire. III Squire Hal, besides, had in this case Pretensions rather brassy; For talents, to deserve a place, Are qualifications saucy. So their worships of the Faculty, Quite sick of Merit's rudeness, Chose one who should owe it all, d'ye see, To their gratis grace and goodness. IV As once on Pisgah purg'd was the sight Of a son of Circumcision, So, may be, on this Pisgah height Bob's purblind mental vision. Nay, Bobby's mouth may be open'd yet, Till for eloquence you hail him, And swear that he has the Angel met That met the Ass of Balaam. V In your heretic sins may ye live and die, Ye heretic Eight-and-Thirty! But accept, ye sublime majority, My congratulations hearty! With your honors, as with a certain King, In your servants this is striking, The more incapacity they bring The more they're to your liking. MISCELLANIES THE TARBOLTON LASSES I If ye gae up to yon hill-tap, Ye'll there see bonie Peggy: She kens her father is a laird, And she forsooth's a leddy. II There's Sophy tight, a lassie bright, Besides a handsome fortune: Wha canna win her in a night Has little art in courtin. III Gae down by Faile, and taste the ale, And tak a look o' Mysie: She's dour and din, a deil within, But aiblins she may please ye. IV If she be shy, her sister try, Ye'll may be fancy Jenny: If ye'll dispense wi' want o' sense, She kens hersel she's bonie. V As ye gae up by yon hillside, Spier in for bonie Bessy: She'll gie ye a beck, and bid ye light, And handsomely address ye. VI There's few sae bonie, nane sae guid In a' King George' dominion: If ye should doubt the truth of this, It's Bessy's ain opinion. THE RONALDS OF THE BENNALS I In Tarbolton, ye ken, there are proper young men, And proper young lasses and a', man: But ken ye the Ronalds that live in the Bennals? They carry the gree frae them a', man. II Their father's a laird, and weel he can spare't: Braid money to tocher them a', man; To proper young men, he'll clink in the hand Gowd guineas a hunder or twa, man. III There's ane they ca' Jean, I'll warrant ye've seen As bonie a lass or as braw, man; But for sense and guid taste she'll vie wi' the best, And a conduct that beautifies a', man. IV The charms o' the min', the langer they shine The mair admiration they draw, man; While peaches and cherries, and roses and lilies, They fade and they wither awa, man. V If ye be for Miss Jean, tak this frae a frien', A hint o' a rival or twa, man: The Laird o' Blackbyre wad gang through the fire, If that wad entice her awa, man. VI The Laird o' Braehead has been on his speed For mair than a towmond or twa, man: The Laird o' the Ford will straught on a board, If he canna get her at a', man. VII Then Anna comes in, the pride o' her kin, The boast of our bachelors a', man: Sae sonsy and sweet, sae fully complete, She steals our affections awa, man. VIII If I should detail the pick and the wale O' lasses that live here awa, man, The faut wad be mine, if they didna shine The sweetest and best o' them a', man. IX I lo'e her mysel, but darena weel tell, My poverty keeps me in awe, man; For making o' rhymes, and working at times, Does little or naething at a', man. X Yet I wadna choose to let her refuse Nor hae't in her power to say na, man: For though I be poor, unnoticed, obscure, My stomach's as proud as them a', man. XI Though I canna ride in well-booted pride, And flee o'er the hills like a craw, man, I can haud up my head wi' the best o' the breed, Though fluttering ever so braw, man. XII My coat and my vest, they are Scotch o' the best; O' pairs o' guid breeks I hae twa, man, And stockings and pumps to put on my stumps, And ne'er a wrang steek in them a', man. XIII My sarks they are few, but five o' them new— Twal' hundred, as white as the snaw, man! A ten-shillings hat, a Holland cravat— There are no monie Poets sae braw, man! XIV I never had frien's weel stockit in means, To leave me a hundred or twa, man; Nae weel-tocher'd aunts, to wait on their drants And wish them in hell for it a', man. XV I never was cannie for hoarding o' money, Or claughtin't together at a', man; I've little to spend and naething to lend, But devil a shilling I awe, man. I'LL GO AND BE A SODGER I O, why the deuce should I repine, And be an ill foreboder? I'm twenty-three and five feet nine, I'll go and be a sodger. II I gat some gear wi' meikle care, I held it weel thegither; But now it's gane—and something mair: I'll go and be a sodger. APOSTROPHE TO FERGUSSON INSCRIBED ABOVE AND BELOW HIS PORTRAIT Curse on ungrateful man, that can be pleas'd And yet can starve the author of the pleasure! O thou, my elder brother in misfortune, By far my elder brother in the Muse, With tears I pity thy unhappy fate! Why is the Bard unfitted for the world, Yet has so keen a relish of its pleasures? THE BELLES OF MAUCHLINE I In Mauchline there dwells six proper young belles, The pride of the place and its neighbourhood a', Their carriage and dress, a stranger would guess, In Lon'on or Paris they'd gotten it a'. II Miss Millar is fine, Miss Markland's divine, Miss Smith she has wit, and Miss Betty is braw, There's beauty and fortune to get wi' Miss Morton; But Armour's the jewel for me o' them a'. AH, WOE IS ME, MY MOTHER DEAR Jeremiah, chap. xv. verse 10 I Ah, woe is me, my Mother dear! A man of strife ye've born me: For sair contention I maun bear; They hate, revile, and scorn me. II I ne'er could lend on bill or band, That five per cent. might blest me; And borrowing, on the tither hand, The deil a ane wad trust me. III Yet I, a coin-denyèd wight, By Fortune quite discarded, Ye see how I am day and night By lad and lass blackguarded! INSCRIBED ON A WORK OF HANNAH MORE'S PRESENTED TO THE AUTHOR BY A LADY Thou flatt'ring mark of friendship kind, Still may thy pages call to mind The dear, the beauteous donor! Tho' sweetly female ev'ry part, Yet such a head and—more—the heart Does both the sexes honor: She show'd her taste refin'd and just, When she selected thee, Yet deviating, own I must, For so approving me: But, kind still, I mind still The giver in the gift; I'll bless her, and wiss her A Friend aboon the lift. LINES WRITTEN ON A BANK NOTE Wae worth thy power, thou cursed leaf! Fell source of a' my woe and grief, For lack o' thee I've lost my lass, For lack o' thee I scrimp my glass! I see the children of affliction Unaided, through thy curs'd restriction. I've seen the oppressor's cruel smile Amid his hapless victims' spoil; And for thy potence vainly wish'd To crush the villain in the dust. For lack o' thee I leave this much-lov'd shore, Never, perhaps, to greet old Scotland more. R. B. Kyle THE FAREWELL The valiant, in himself, what can he suffer? Or what does he regard his single woes? But when, alas! he multiplies himself, To dearer selves, to the lov'd tender fair, To those whose bliss, whose beings hang upon him, To helpless children,—then, Oh then he feels The point of misery festering in his heart, And weakly weeps his fortunes like a coward: Such, such am I!—undone! THOMSON'S Edward and Eleanora I Farewell, old Scotia's bleak domains, Far dearer than the torrid plains, Where rich ananas blow! Farewell, a mother's blessing dear A brother's sigh, a sister's tear, My Jean's heart-rending throe! Farewell, my Bess! Tho' thou 'rt bereft Of my paternal care, A faithful brother I have left, My part in him thou'lt share! Adieu too, to you too, My Smith, my bosom frien'; When kindly you mind me, O, then befriend my Jean! II What bursting anguish tears my heart? From thee, my Jeany, must I part? Thou, weeping, answ'rest: ‘No!’ Alas! misfortune stares my face, And points to ruin and disgrace— I for thy sake must go! Thee, Hamilton, and Aiken dear, A grateful, warm adieu: I with a much-indebted tear Shall still remember you! All-hail, then, the gale then Wafts me from thee, dear shore! It rustles, and whistles— I'll never see thee more! ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF ROBERT RUISSEAUX I Now Robin lies in his last lair, He'll gabble rhyme, nor sing nae mair; Cauld Poverty wi' hungry stare Nae mair shall fear him; Nor anxious Fear, nor cankert Care, E'er mair come near him. II To tell the truth, they seldom fash'd him, Except the moment that they crush'd him; For sune as Chance or Fate had hush'd 'em, Tho' e'er sae short, Then wi' a rhyme or sang he lash'd 'em, And thought it sport. III Tho' he was bred to kintra-wark, And counted was baith wight and stark, Yet that was never Robin's mark To mak a man; But tell him, he was learned and clark, Ye roos'd him then! VERSES INTENDED TO BE WRITTEN BELOW A NOBLE EARL'S PICTURE I Whose is that noble, dauntless brow? And whose that eye of fire? And whose that generous princely mien, Ev'n rooted foes admire? II Stranger! to justly show that brow And mark that eye of fire, Would take His hand, whose vernal tints His other works admire! III Bright as a cloudless summer sun, With stately port he moves; His guardian Seraph eyes with awe The noble Ward he loves. IV Among the illustrious Scottish sons That Chief thou may'st discern: Mark Scotia's fond-returning eye— It dwells upon Glencairn. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF SIR JAMES HUNTER BLAIR I The lamp of day with ill-presaging glare, Dim, cloudy, sank beneath the western wave; Th'inconstant blast howl'd thro' the darkening air, And hollow whistled in the rocky cave. II Lone as I wander'd by each cliff and dell, Once the lov'd haunts of Scotia's royal train; Or mus'd where limpid streams, once hallow'd, well, Or mould'ring ruins mark the sacred Fane. III Th'increasing blast roared round the beetling rocks, The clouds, swift-wing'd, flew o'er the starry sky, The groaning trees untimely shed their locks, And shooting meteors caught the startled eye. IV The paly moon rose in the livid east, And 'mong the cliffs disclos'd a stately form In weeds of woe, that frantic beat her breast, And mix'd her wailings with the raving storm. V Wild to my heart the filial pulses glow: 'Twas Caledonia's trophied shield I view'd, Her form majestic droop'd in pensive woe, The lightning of her eye in tears imbued; VI Revers'd that spear redoubtable in war, Reclined that banner, erst in fields unfurl'd, That like a deathful meteor gleam'd afar, And brav'd the mighty monarchs of the world. VII ‘My patriot son fills an untimely grave!’ With accents wild and lifted arms, she cried; ‘Low lies the hand that oft was stretch'd to save, Low lies the heart that swell'd with honor's pride. VIII ‘A weeping country joins a widow's tear; The helpless poor mix with the orphan's cry; The drooping Arts surround their patron's bier; And grateful Science heaves the heart-felt sigh. IX ‘I saw my sons resume their ancient fire; I saw fair Freedom's blossoms richly blow. But ah! how hope is born but to expire! Relentless fate has laid their guardian low. X ‘My patriot falls, but shall he lie unsung, While empty greatness saves a worthless name? No: every Muse shall join her tuneful tongue, And future ages hear his growing fame. XI ‘And I will join a mother's tender cares Thro' future times to make his virtues last, That distant years may boast of other Blairs!’— She said, and vanish'd with the sweeping blast. ON THE DEATH OF LORD PRESIDENT DUNDAS Lone on the bleaky hills, the straying flocks Shun the fierce storms among the sheltering rocks; Down foam the rivulets, red with dashing rains; The gathering floods burst o'er the distant plains; Beneath the blast the leafless forests groan; The hollow caves return a hollow moan. Ye hills, ye plains, ye forests, and ye caves, Ye howling winds, and wintry swelling waves, Unheard, unseen, by human ear or eye, Sad to your sympathetic glooms I fly, Where to the whistling blast and water's roar Pale Scotia's recent wound I may deplore! O heavy loss, thy country ill could bear! A loss these evil days can ne'er repair! Justice, the high vicegerent of her God, Her doubtful balance eyed, and sway'd her rod; Hearing the tidings of the fatal blow, She sank, abandon'd to the wildest woe. Wrongs, injuries, from many a darksome den, Now gay in hope explore the paths of men. See from his cavern grim Oppression rise, And throw on Poverty his cruel eyes! Keen on the helpless victim let him fly, And stifle, dark, the feebly-bursting cry! Mark Ruffian Violence, distained with crimes, Rousing elate in these degenerate times! View unsuspecting Innocence a prey, As guileful Fraud points out the erring way; While subtile Litigation's pliant tongue The life-blood equal sucks of Right and Wrong! Hark, injur'd Want recounts th'unlisten'd tale, And much-wrong'd Mis'ry pours th'unpitied wail! Ye dark, waste hills, ye brown, unsightly plains, Congenial scenes, ye soothe my mournful strains. Ye tempests, rage! ye turbid torrents, roll! Ye suit the joyless tenor of my soul. Life's social haunts and pleasures I resign; Be nameless wilds and lonely wanderings mine, To mourn the woes my country must endure: That wound degenerate ages cannot cure. ELEGY ON WILLIE NICOL'S MARE I Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare As ever trod on airn; But now she's floating down the Nith, And past the mouth o' Cairn. II Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare, An' rode thro' thick an' thin; But now she's floating down the Nith, And wanting even the skin. III Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare, And ance she bore a priest; But now she's floating down the Nith, For Solway fish a feast. IV Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare, An' the priest he rode her sair; And much oppress'd, and bruis'd she was, As priest-rid cattle are. LINES ON FERGUSSON I Ill-fated genius! Heaven-taught Fergusson! What heart that feels, and will not yield a tear To think Life's sun did set, e'er well begun To shed its influence on thy bright career! II O, why should truest Worth and Genius pine Beneath the iron grasp of Want and Woe, While titled knaves and idiot-greatness shine In all the splendour Fortune can bestow? ELEGY ON THE LATE MISS BURNET OF MONBODDO I Life ne'er exulted in so rich a prize As Burnet, lovely from her native skies; Nor envious Death so triumph'd in a blow As that which laid th'accomplish'd Burnet low. II Thy form and mind, sweet maid, can I forget? In richest ore the brightest jewel set! In thee high Heaven above was truest shown, For by His noblest work the Godhead best is known. III In vain ye flaunt in summer's pride, ye groves! Thou crystal streamlet with thy flowery shore, Ye woodland choir that chaunt your idle loves, Ye cease to charm: Eliza is no more. IV Ye heathy wastes immix'd with reedy fens, Ye mossy streams with sedge and rushes stor'd, Ye rugged cliffs o'erhanging dreary glens, To you I fly: ye with my soul accord. V Princes whose cumb'rous pride was all their worth, Shall venal lays their pompous exit hail, And thou, sweet Excellence! forsake our earth, And not a Muse with honest grief bewail? VI We saw thee shine in youth and beauty's pride And Virtue's light, that beams beyond the spheres; But, like the sun eclips'd at morning tide, Thou left us darkling in a world of tears. VII The parent's heart that nestled fond in thee, That heart how sunk, a prey to grief and care! So deckt the woodbine sweet yon aged tree, So, rudely ravish'd, left it bleak and bare. PEGASUS AT WANLOCKHEAD I With Pegasus upon a day Apollo, weary flying (Through frosty hills the journey lay), On foot the way was plying. II Poor slip-shod, giddy Pegasus Was but a sorry walker; To Vulcan then Apollo goes To get a frosty caulker. III Obliging Vulcan fell to work, Threw by his coat and bonnet, And did Sol's business in a crack— Sol paid him in a sonnet. IV Ye Vulcan's sons of Wanlockhead, Pity my sad disaster! My Pegasus is poorly shod— I'll pay you like my master! Ramage's, 3 o'clock ON SOME COMMEMORATIONS OF THOMSON I Dost thou not rise, indignant Shade, And smile wi' spurning scorn, When they wha wad hae starved thy life Thy senseless turf adorn? II They wha about thee mak sic fuss Now thou art but a name, Wad seen thee damn'd ere they had spar'd Ae plack to fill thy wame. III Helpless, alane, thou clamb the brae Wi' meikle honest toil, And claucht th'unfading garland there, Thy sair-won, rightful spoil. IV And wear it there! and call aloud This axiom undoubted:— Would thou hae Nobles' patronage? First learn to live without it! V ‘To whom hae much, more shall be given’ Is every great man's faith; But he, the helpless, needful wretch, Shall lose the mite he hath. ON GENERAL DUMOURIER'S DESERTION FROM THE FRENCH REPUBLICAN ARMY I You're welcome to Despots, Dumourier! You're welcome to Despots, Dumourier! How does Dampiere do? Ay, and Bournonville too? Why did they not come along with you, Dumourier? II I will fight France with you, Dumourier, I will fight France with you, Dumourier; I will fight France with you, I will take my chance with you, By my soul, I'll dance with you, Dumourier! III Then let us fight about, Dumourier! Then let us fight about, Dumourier! Then let us fight about Till Freedom's spark be out, Then we'll be damn'd, no doubt, Dumourier. ON JOHN M'MURDO Blest be M'Murdo to his latest day! No envious cloud o'ercast his evening ray! No wrinkle furrow'd by the hand of care, Nor ever sorrow, add one silver hair! O may no son the father's honor stain, Nor ever daughter give the mother pain! ON HEARING A THRUSH SING IN A MORNING WALK IN JANUARY Sing on, sweet thrush, upon the leafless bough, Sing on, sweet bird, I listen to thy strain: See aged Winter, 'mid his surly reign, At thy blythe carol clears his furrowed brow. So in lone Poverty's dominion drear Sits meek Content with light, unanxious heart, Welcomes the rapid moments, bids them part, Nor asks if they bring ought to hope or fear. I thank Thee, Author of this opening day, Thou whose bright sun now gilds yon orient skies! Riches denied, Thy boon was purer joys: What wealth could never give nor take away! Yet come, thou child of Poverty and Care, The mite high Heav'n bestow'd, that mite with thee I'll share. IMPROMPTU ON MRS. RIDDELL'S BIRTHDAY 4TH NOVEMBER 1793 I Old Winter, with his frosty beard, Thus once to Jove his prayer preferred:— ‘What have I done of all the year, To bear this hated doom severe? My cheerless suns no pleasure know; Night's horrid car drags dreary slow; My dismal months no joys are crowning, But spleeny, English hanging, drowning. II Now Jove, for once be mighty civil: To counterbalance all this evil Give me, and I've no more to say, Give me Maria's natal day! That brilliant gift shall so enrich me, Spring, Summer, Autumn, cannot match me.’ ‘'Tis done!’ says Jove; so ends my story, And Winter once rejoiced in glory. SONNET ON THE DEATH OF ROBERT RIDDELL OF GLENRIDDELL No more, ye warblers of the wood, no more, Nor pour your descant grating on my soul! Thou young-eyed Spring, gay in thy verdant stole, More welcome were to me grim Winter's wildest roar! How can ye charm, ye flowers, with all your dyes? Ye blow upon the sod that wraps my friend. How can I to the tuneful strain attend? That strain flows round the untimely tomb where Riddell lies. Yes, pour, ye warblers, pour the notes of woe, And sooth the Virtues weeping o'er his bier! The man of worth—and ‘hath not left his peer’!— Is in his ‘narrow house’ for ever darkly low. Thee, Spring, again with joy shall others greet; Me, memory of my loss will only meet. A SONNET UPON SONNETS Fourteen, a sonneteer thy praises sings; What magic myst'ries in that number lie! Your hen hath fourteen eggs beneath her wings That fourteen chickens to the roost may fly. Fourteen full pounds the jockey's stone must be; His age fourteen—a horse's prime is past. Fourteen long hours too oft the Bard must fast; Fourteen bright bumpers—bliss he ne'er must see! Before fourteen, a dozen yields the strife; Before fourteen—e'en thirteen's strength is vain. Fourteen good years—a woman gives us life; Fourteen good men—we lose that life again. What lucubrations can be more upon it? Fourteen good measur'd verses make a sonnet. FRAGMENTS TRAGIC FRAGMENT All villain as I am—a damnèd wretch, A hardened, stubborn, unrepenting sinner— Still my heart melts at human wretchedness, And with sincere, tho' unavailing, sighs I view the helpless children of distress. With tears indignant I behold the oppressor Rejoicing in the honest man's destruction, Whose unsubmitting heart was all his crime. Ev'n you, ye hapless crew! I pity you; Ye, whom the seeming good think sin to pity: Ye poor, despised, abandoned vagabonds, Whom Vice, as usual, has turn'd o'er to ruin. Oh! but for friends and interposing Heaven, I had been driven forth, like you forlorn, The most detested, worthless wretch among you! O injured God! Thy goodness has endow'd me With talents passing most of my compeers, Which I in just proportion have abused, As far surpassing other common villains As Thou in natural parts has given me more. REMORSE Of all the numerous ills that hurt our peace, That press the soul, or wring the mind with anguish, Beyond comparison the worst are those By our own folly, or our guilt brought on: In ev'ry other circumstance, the mind Has this to say:—‘It was no deed of mine.’ But, when to all the evil of misfortune This sting is added:—‘Blame thy foolish self!’ Or, worser far, the pangs of keen remorse, The torturing, gnawing consciousness of guilt, Of guilt, perhaps, where we've involvèd others, The young, the innocent, who fondly lov'd us; Nay, more, that very love their cause of ruin! O burning Hell! in all thy store of torments There's not a keener lash! Lives there a man so firm, who, while his heart Feels all the bitter horrors of his crime, Can reason down its agonizing throbs, And, after proper purpose of amendment, Can firmly force his jarring thoughts to peace? O happy, happy, enviable man! O glorious magnanimity of soul! RUSTICITY'S UNGAINLY FORM I Rusticity's ungainly form May cloud the highest mind; But when the heart is nobly warm, The good excuse will find. II Propriety's cold, cautious rules Warm Fervour may o'erlook; But spare poor Sensibility Th'ungentle, harsh rebuke. ON WILLIAM CREECH A little upright, pert, tart, tripping wight, And still his precious self his dear delight; Who loves his own smart shadow in the streets Better than e'er the fairest She he meets. Much specious lore, but little understood (Veneering oft outshines the solid wood), His solid sense by inches you must tell, But mete his subtle cunning by the ell! A man of fashion, too, he made his tour, Learn'd ‘Vive la bagatelle et vive l'amour’: So travell'd monkies their grimace improve, Polish their grin—nay, sigh for ladies' love! His meddling vanity, a busy fiend, Still making work his selfish craft must mend. ON WILLIAM SMELLIE Crochallan came: The old cock'd hat, the brown surtout the same; His grisly beard just bristling in its might ('Twas four long nights and days to shaving-night); His uncomb'd, hoary locks, wild-staring, thatch'd A head for thought profound and clear unmatch'd; Yet, tho' his caustic wit was biting rude, His heart was warm, benevolent, and good. SKETCH FOR AN ELEGY I Craigdarroch, fam'd for speaking art And every virtue of the heart, Stops short, nor can a word impart To end his sentence, When mem'ry strikes him like a dart With auld acquaintance. II Black James—whase wit was never laith, But, like a sword had tint the sheath, Ay ready for the work o' death— He turns aside, And strains wi' suffocating breath His grief to hide. III Even Philosophic Smellie tries To choak the stream that floods his eyes: So Moses wi' a hazel-rice Came o'er the stane; But, tho' it cost him speaking twice, It gush'd amain. IV Go to your marble graffs, ye great, In a' the tinkler-trash of state! But by thy honest turf I'll wait, Thou man of worth, And weep the ae best fallow's fate E'er lay in earth! PASSION'S CRY Mild zephyrs waft thee to life's farthest shore, Nor think of me and my distresses more! Falsehood accurst! No! Still I beg a place, Still near thy heart some little, little trace! For that dear trace the world I would resign: O, let me live, and die, and think it mine! By all I lov'd, neglected, and forgot, No friendly face e'er lights my squalid cot. Shunn'd, hated, wrong'd, unpitied, unredrest The mock'd quotation of the scorner's jest; Ev'n the poor support of my wretched life, Snatched by the violence of legal strife; Oft grateful for my very daily bread, To those my family's once large bounty fed; A welcome inmate at their homely fare, My griefs, my woes, my sighs, my tears they share: Their vulgar souls unlike the souls refined, The fashion'd marble of the polish'd mind. ‘I burn, I burn, as when thro' ripen'd corn By driving winds the crackling flames are borne.’ Now, maddening-wild, I curse that fatal night, Now bless the hour that charm'd my guilty sight. In vain the Laws their feeble force oppose: Chain'd at his feet, they groan Love's vanquish'd foes. In vain Religion meets my shrinking eye: I dare not combat, but I turn and fly. Conscience in vain upbraids th'unhallow'd fire. Love grasps his scorpions—stifled they expire. Reason drops headlong from his sacred throne. Your dear idea reigns, and reigns alone; Each thought intoxicated homage yields, And riots wanton in forbidden fields. By all on high adoring mortals know; By all the conscious villain fears below; By what, alas! much more my soul alarms— My doubtful hopes once more to fill thy arms— Ev'n shouldst thou, false, forswear the guilty tie, Thine and thine only I must live and die! IN VAIN WOULD PRUDENCE In vain would Prudence with decorous sneer Point out a censuring world, and bid me fear: Above that world on wings of love I rise, I know its worst, and can that worst despise. ‘Wrong'd, injur'd, shunn'd, unpitied, unredrest, The mock'd quotation of the scorner's jest,’ Let Prudence' direst bodements on me fall, Clarinda, rich reward! o'erpays them all. THE CARES O' LOVE HE The cares o' Love are sweeter far Than onie other pleasure; And if sae dear its sorrows are, Enjoyment, what a treasure! SHE I fear to try, I dare na try A passion sae ensnaring; For light's her heart and blythe's her song That for nae man is caring. EPIGRAMS EXTEMPORE IN THE COURT OF SESSION Tune: Killiecrankie LORD ADVOCATE He clench'd his pamphlets in his fist, He quoted and he hinted, Till in a declamation-mist His argument, he tint it: He gapèd for 't, he grapèd for 't, He fand it was awa, man; But what his common sense came short, He ekèd out wi' law, man. MR. ERSKINE Collected, Harry stood awee, Then open'd out his arm, man; His lordship sat wi' ruefu' e'e, And ey'd the gathering storm, man; Like wind-driv'n hail it did assail, Or torrents owre a linn, man; The Bench sae wise lift up their eyes, Hauf-wauken'd wi' the din, man. AT ROSLIN INN My blessings on ye, honest wife! I ne'er was here before; Ye've wealth o' gear for spoon and knife: Heart could not wish for more. Heav'n keep you clear o' sturt and strife, Till far ayont fourscore, And by the Lord o' death and life, I'll ne'er gae by your door! TO AN ARTIST Dear ?, I'll gie ye some advice, You'll tak it no uncivil: You shouldna paint at angels, man, But try and paint the Devil. To paint an angel's kittle wark, Wi' Nick there's little danger: You'll easy draw a lang-kent face, But no sae weel a stranger. R. B. THE BOOK-WORMS Through and through th'inspirèd leaves, Ye maggots, make your windings; But O, respect his lordship's taste, And spare the golden bindings! ON ELPHINSTONE'S TRANSLATION OF MARTIAL O thou whom Poesy abhors, Whom Prose has turnèd out of doors, Heard'st thou yon groan?—Proceed no further! 'Twas laurel'd Martial calling ‘Murther!’ ON JOHNSON'S OPINION OF HAMPDEN For shame! Let Folly and Knavery Freedom oppose: 'Tis suicide, Genius, To mix with her foes. UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF MISS BURNS Cease, ye prudes, your envious railing! Lovely Burns has charms: confess! True it is she had ae failing: Had ae woman ever less? ON MISS AINSLIE IN CHURCH Fair maid, you need not take the hint, Nor idle texts pursue; 'Twas guilty sinners that he meant, Not angels such as you. AT INVERARAY I Whoe'er he be that sojourns here, I pity much his case, Unless he come to wait upon The Lord their God, ‘His Grace.’ II There's naething here but Highland pride And Highland scab and hunger: If Providence has sent me here, 'Twas surely in an anger. AT CARRON IRONWORKS We cam na here to view your warks In hopes to be mair wise, But only, lest we gang to Hell, It may be nae surprise. But when we tirl'd at your door Your porter dought na bear us: Sae may, should we to Hell's yetts come, Your billie Satan sair us. ON SEEING THE ROYAL PALACE AT STIRLING IN RUINS Here Stewarts once in glory reign'd, And laws for Scotland's weal ordain'd; But now unroof'd their palace stands, Their sceptre fallen to other hands: Fallen indeed, and to the earth, Whence grovelling reptiles take their birth! The injured Stewart line is gone, A race outlandish fills their throne: An idiot race, to honour lost— Who know them best despise them most. ADDITIONAL LINES AT STIRLING Rash mortal, and slanderous poet, thy name Shall no longer appear in the records of Fame! Dost not know that old Mansfield, who writes like the Bible, Says, the more 'tis a truth, Sir, the more 'tis a libel? REPLY TO THE THREAT OF A CENSORIOUS CRITIC With Æsop's lion, Burns says:—‘Sore I feel Each other blow: but damn that ass's heel!’ A HIGHLAND WELCOME When Death's dark stream I ferry o'er (A time that surely shall come), In Heaven itself I'll ask no more Than just a Highland welcome. AT WHIGHAM'S INN SANQUHAR Envy, if thy jaundiced eye Through this window chance to spy, To thy sorrow thou shalt find, All that's generous, all that's kind. Friendship, virtue, every grace, Dwelling in this happy place. VERSICLES ON SIGN-POSTS 1 He looked Just as your sign-post Lions do, With aspect fierce and quite as harmless too. 2 (PATIENT STUPIDITY) So heavy, passive to the tempest's shocks, Dull on the sign-post stands the stupid ox. 3 His face with smile eternal drest Just like the landlord to his guest, High as they hang with creaking din To index out the Country Inn. 4 A head, pure, sinless quite of brain and soul, The very image of a barber's poll: Just shews a human face, and wears a wig, And looks, when well friseur'd, amazing big. ON MISS JEAN SCOTT O, had each Scot of ancient times Been, Jeanie Scott, as thou art, The bravest heart on English ground Had yielded like a coward. ON CAPTAIN FRANCIS GROSE The Devil got notice that Grose was a-dying, So whip! at the summons, old Satan came flying; But when he approach'd where poor Francis lay moaning, And saw each bed-post with its burthen a-groaning, Astonish'd, confounded, cries Satan:—‘By God, I'd want him ere take such a damnable load!’ ON BEING APPOINTED TO AN EXCISE DIVISION Searching auld wives' barrels, Ochon, the day That clarty barm should stain my laurels! But what'll ye say? These movin' things ca'd wives an' weans Wad move the very hearts o' stanes. ON MISS DAVIES Ask why God made the gem so small, And why so huge the granite? Because God meant mankind should set That higher value on it. ON A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY SEAT We grant they're thine, those beauties all, So lovely in our eye: Keep them, thou eunuch, Cardoness, For others to enjoy. THE TYRANT WIFE Curs'd be the man, the poorest wretch in life, The crouching vassal to the tyrant wife! Who has no will but by her high permission; Who has not sixpence but in her possession; Who must to her his dear friend's secret tell; Who dreads a curtain lecture worse than hell! Were such the wife had fallen to my part, I'd break her spirit, or I'd break her heart: I'd charm her with the magic of a switch, I'd kiss her maids, and kick the perverse bitch. AT BROWNHILL INN At Brownhill we always get dainty good cheer And plenty of bacon each day in the year; We've a' thing that's nice, and mostly in season: But why always bacon?—come, tell me the reason? THE TOADEATER Of Lordly acquaintance you boast, And the Dukes that you dined with yestreen, Yet an insect's an insect at most, Tho' it crawl on the curl of a Queen! IN LAMINGTON KIRK As cauld a wind as ever blew, A cauld kirk, and in't but few, As cauld a minister's ever spak— Ye'se a' be het or I come back! THE KEEKIN GLASS How daur ye ca'me ‘Howlet-face,’ Ye blear-e'ed, wither'd spectre? Ye only spied the keekin-glass, An' there ye saw your picture. AT THE GLOBE TAVERN, DUMFRIES 1 The greybeard, old Wisdom, may boast of his treasures, Give me with gay Folly to live! I grant him his calm-blooded, time-settled pleasures, But Folly has raptures to give. 2 I I murder hate by field or flood, Tho' Glory's name may screen us. In wars at hame I'll spend my blood— Life-giving wars of Venus. The deities that I adore Are Social Peace and Plenty: I'm better pleas'd to make one more Than be the death of twenty. II I would not die like Socrates, For all the fuss of Plato; Nor would I with Leonidas, Nor yet would I with Cato; The zealots of the Church and State Shall ne'er my mortal foes be; But let me have bold Zimri's fate Within the arms of Cozbi. 3 My bottle is a holy pool, That heals the wounds o' care an' dool, And pleasure is a wanton trout— An ye drink it, ye'll find him out. 4 In politics if thou would'st mix, And mean thy fortunes be; Bear this in mind: Be deaf and blind, Let great folks hear and see. YE TRUE LOYAL NATIVES Ye true ‘Loyal Natives’ attend to my song: In uproar and riot rejoice the night long! From Envy and Hatred your core is exempt, But where is your shield from the darts of Contempt? ON COMMISSARY GOLDIE'S BRAINS Lord, to account who does Thee call, Or e'er dispute Thy pleasure? Else why within so thick a wall Enclose so poor a treasure? IN A LADY'S POCKET BOOK Grant me, indulgent Heaven, that I may live To see the miscreants feel the pains they give! Deal Freedom's sacred treasures free as air, Till Slave and Despot be but things that were! AGAINST THE EARL OF GALLOWAY What dost thou in that mansion fair? Flit, Galloway, and find Some narrow, dirty, dungeon cave, The picture of thy mind. ON THE SAME No Stewart art thou, Galloway: The Stewarts all were brave. Besides, the Stewarts were but fools, Not one of them a knave. ON THE SAME Bright ran thy line, O Galloway, Thro' many a far-famed sire! So ran the far-famed Roman way, And ended in a mire. ON THE SAME, ON THE AUTHOR BEING THREATENED WITH VENGEANCE Spare me thy vengeance, Galloway! In quiet let me live: I ask no kindness at thy hand, For thou hast none to give. ON THE LAIRD OF LAGGAN When Morine, deceas'd, to the Devil went down, 'Twas nothing would serve him but Satan's own crown. ‘Thy fool's head,’ quoth Satan, ‘that crown shall wear never: I grant thou'rt as wicked, but not quite so clever.’ ON MARIA RIDDELL ‘Praise Woman still,’ his lordship roars, ‘Deserv'd or not, no matter!’ But thee whom all my soul adores, There Flattery cannot flatter! Maria, all my thought and dream, Inspires my vocal shell: The more I praise my lovely theme, The more the truth I tell. ON MISS FONTENELLE Sweet näiveté of feature, Simple, wild, enchanting elf, Not to thee, but thanks to Nature Thou art acting but thyself. Wert thou awkward, stiff, affected, Spurning Nature, torturing art, Loves and Graces all rejected, Then indeed thou 'dst act a part. KIRK AND STATE EXCISEMEN Ye men of wit and wealth, why all this sneering 'Gainst poor Excisemen? Give the cause a hearing. What are your Landlord's rent-rolls? Taxing ledgers! What Premiers? What ev'n Monarchs? Mighty Gaugers! Nay, what are Priests (those seeming godly wisemen)? What are they, pray, but Spiritual Excisemen! ON THANKSGIVING FOR A NATIONAL VICTORY Ye hypocrites! are these your pranks? To murder men, and give God thanks? Desist for shame! Proceed no further: God won't accept your thanks for Murther. PINNED TO MRS. WALTER RIDDELL'S CARRIAGE If you rattle along like your mistress's tongue, Your speed will out-rival the dart; But, a fly for your load, you'll break down on the road, If your stuff be as rotten's her heart. TO DR. MAXWELL ON MISS JESSY STAIG'S RECOVERY Maxwell, if merit here you crave, That merit I deny: You save fair Jessie from the grave!— An Angel could not die! TO THE BEAUTIFUL MISS ELIZA J?N ON HER PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND EQUALITY How, ‘Liberty!’ Girl, can it be by thee nam'd? ‘Equality,’ too! Hussey, art not asham'd? Free and Equal indeed, while mankind thou enchainest, And over their hearts a proud Despot so reignest ON CHLORIS REQUESTING ME TO GIVE HER A SPRIG OF BLOSSOMED THORN From the white-blossom'd sloe my dear Chloris requested A sprig, her fair breast to adorn: ‘No, by Heaven!’ I exclaim'd, ‘let me perish for ever, Ere I plant in that bosom a thorn!’ TO THE HON. WM. R. MAULE OF PANMURE Thou Fool, in thy phaeton towering, Art proud when that phaeton's prais'd? 'Tis the pride of a Thief's exhibition When higher his pillory's rais'd. ON SEEING MRS. KEMBLE IN YARICO Kemble, thou cur'st my unbelief Of Moses and his rod: At Yarico's sweet notes of grief The rock with tears had flow'd. ON DR. BABINGTON'S LOOKS That there is a falsehood in his looks I must and will deny: They say their Master is a knave, And sure they do not lie. ON ANDREW TURNER In Se'enteen Hunder 'n Forty-Nine The Deil gat stuff to mak a swine, An' coost it in a corner; But wilily he chang'd his plan, An' shap'd it something like a man, An' ca'd it Andrew Turner. THE SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT The Solemn League and Covenant Now brings a smile, now brings a tear. But sacred Freedom, too, was theirs: If thou'rt a slave, indulge thy sneer. TO JOHN SYME OF RYEDALE WITH A PRESENT OF A DOZEN OF PORTER O had the malt thy strength of mind, Or hops the flavour of thy wit, 'Twere drink for first of human kind— A gift that ev'n for Syme were fit. Jerusalem Tavern, Dumfries ON A GOBLET There's Death in the cup, so beware! Nay, more—there is danger in touching! But who can avoid the fell snare? The man and his wine's so bewitching! APOLOGY TO JOHN SYME No more of your guests, be they titled or not, And cookery the first in the nation: Who is proof to thy personal converse and wit Is proof to all other temptation. ON MR. JAMES GRACIE Gracie, thou art a man of worth, O, be thou Dean for ever! May he be damn'd to Hell henceforth, Who fauts thy weight or measure! AT FRIARS CARSE HERMITAGE To Riddell, much-lamented man, This ivied cot was dear: Wand'rer, dost value matchless worth? This ivied cot revere. FOR AN ALTAR OF INDEPENDENCE AT KERROUGHTRIE, THE SEAT OF MR. HERON Thou of an independent mind, With soul resolv'd, with soul resign'd, Prepar'd Power's proudest frown to brave, Who wilt not be, nor have a slave, Virtue alone who dost revere, Thy own reproach alone dost fear: Approach this shrine, and worship here. VERSICLES TO JESSIE LEWARS THE TOAST Fill me with the rosy wine; Call a toast, a toast divine; Give the Poet's darling flame; Lovely Jessie be her name: Then thou mayest freely boast Thou hast given a peerless toast. THE MENAGERIE I Talk not to me of savages From Afric's burning sun! No savage e'er can rend my heart As, Jessie, thou hast done. II But Jessie's lovely hand in mine A mutual faith to plight— Not even to view the heavenly choir Would be so blest a sight. JESSIE'S ILLNESS Say, sages, what's the charm on earth Can turn Death's dart aside? It is not purity and worth, Else Jessie had not died! HER RECOVERY But rarely seen since Nature's birth The natives of the sky! Yet still one seraph's left on earth, For Jessie did not die. ON MARRIAGE That hackney'd judge of human life, The Preacher and the King, Observes:—‘The man that gets a wife He gets a noble thing.’ But how capricious are mankind, Now loathing, now desirous! We married men, how oft we find The best of things will tire us! GRACES A POET'S GRACE BEFORE MEAT O Thou, who kindly dost provide For ev'ry creature's want! We bless the God of Nature wide For all Thy goodness lent. And if it please Thee, heavenly Guide, May never worse be sent; But, whether granted or denied, Lord, bless us with content. AFTER MEAT O Thou, in whom we live and move, Who made the sea and shore, Thy goodness constantly we prove, And, grateful, would adore; And, if it please Thee, Power above! Still grant us with such store The friend we trust, the fair we love, And we desire no more. AT THE GLOBE TAVERN BEFORE MEAT O Lord, when hunger pinches sore, Do Thou stand us in stead, And send us from Thy bounteous store A tup-or wether-head. AFTER MEAT 1 Lord [Thee] we thank, and Thee alone, For temporal gifts we little merit! At present we will ask no more: Let William Hislop bring the spirit. 2 O Lord, since we have feasted thus, Which we so little merit, Let Meg now take the flesh away, And Jock bring in the spirit. 3 O Lord, we do Thee humbly thank For that we little merit: Now Jean may tak the flesh away, And Will bring in the spirit. EPITAPHS ON JAMES GRIEVE, LAIRD OF BOGHEAD, TARBOLTON Here lies Boghead amang the dead In hopes to get salvation; But if such as he in Heav'n may be, Then welcome—hail! damnation. ON WM. MUIR IN TARBOLTON MILL An honest man here lies at rest, As e'er God with His image blest: The friend of man, the friend of truth, The friend of age, and guide of youth: Few hearts like his—with virtue warm'd, Few heads with knowledge so inform'd: If there's another world, he lives in bliss; If there is none, he made the best of this. ON JOHN RANKINE Ae day, as Death, that gruesome carl, Was driving to the tither warl' A mixtie-maxtie, motley squad And monie a guilt-bespotted lad: Black gowns of each denomination, And thieves of every rank and station, From him that wears the star and garter To him that wintles in a halter: Asham'd himself to see the wretches, He mutters, glow'ring at the bitches:— ‘By God I'll not be seen behint them, Nor 'mang the sp'ritual core present them, Without at least ae honest man To grace this damn'd infernal clan!’ By Adamhill a glance he threw, ‘Lord God!’ quoth he, ‘I have it now, There's just the man I want, i' faith!’ And quickly stoppit Rankine's breath. ON TAM THE CHAPMAN As Tam the chapman on a day Wi' Death forgather'd by the way, Weel pleas'd he greets a wight so famous, And Death was nae less pleas'd wi' Thomas, Wha cheerfully lays down his pack, And there blaws up a hearty crack: His social, friendly, honest heart Sae tickled Death, they could na part; Sae, after viewing knives and garters, Death taks him hame to gie him quarters. ON HOLY WILLIE I Here Holy Willie's sair worn clay Taks up its last abode; His saul has taen some other way— I fear, the left-hand road. II Stop! there he is as sure's a gun! Poor, silly body, see him! Nae wonder he's as black's the grun— Observe wha's standing wi' him! III Your brunstane Devilship, I see, Has got him there before ye! But haud your nine-tail-cat a wee, Till ance you've heard my story. IV Your pity I will not implore, For pity ye have nane. Justice, alas! has gi'en him o'er, And mercy's day is gane. V But hear me, Sir, Deil as ye are, Look something to your credit: A cuif like him wad stain your name, If it were kent ye did it! ON JOHN DOVE, INNKEEPER I Here lies Johnie Pigeon: What was his religion Whae'er desires to ken To some other warl' Maun follow the carl, For here Johnie Pigeon had nane! II Strong ale was ablution; Small beer, persecution; A dram was memento mori; But a full flowing bowl Was the saving his soul, And port was celestial glory! ON A WAG IN MAUCHLINE I Lament him, Mauchline husbands a', He aften did assist ye; For had ye staid hale weeks awa', Your wives they ne'er had missed ye! II Ye Mauchline bairns, as on ye pass To school in bands thegither, O, tread ye lightly on his grass— Perhaps he was your father! ON ROBERT FERGUSSON ON THE TOMBSTONE IN THE CANONGATE CHURCHYARD HERE LIES ROBERT FERGUSSON BORN SEPT. 5TH, 1751 DIED OCT. 16TH, 1774 No sculptur'd Marble here, nor pompous lay, No storied Urn nor animated Bust; This simple stone directs pale Scotia's way To pour her sorrow o'er the Poet's dust. ADDITIONAL STANZAS NOT INSCRIBED I She mourns, sweet tuneful youth, thy hapless fate: Tho' all the powers of song thy fancy fir'd, Yet Luxury and Wealth lay by in State, And, thankless, starv'd what they so much admir'd. II This humble tribute with a tear he gives, A brother Bard—he can no more bestow: But dear to fame thy Song immortal lives, A nobler monument than Art can show. FOR WILLIAM NICOL Ye maggots, feed on Nicol's brain, For few sic feasts you've gotten; And fix your claws in Nicol's heart, For deil a bit o't's rotten. FOR MR. WILLIAM MICHIE SCHOOLMASTER OF CLEISH PARISH, FIFESHIRE Here lie Willie Michie's banes: O Satan, when ye tak him, Gie him the schulin o' your weans, For clever deils he'll mak them! FOR WILLIAM CRUICKSHANK, A.M. Now honest William's gaen to Heaven, I wat na gin't can mend him: The fauts he had in Latin lay, For nane in English kent them. ON ROBERT MUIR What man could esteem, or what woman could love, Was he who lies under this sod: If such Thou refusest admission above, Then whom wilt Thou favour, Good God? ON A LAP-DOG I In wood and wild, ye warbling throng, Your heavy loss deplore: Now half extinct your powers of song— Sweet Echo is no more. II Ye jarring, screeching things around, Scream your discordant joys: Now half your din of tuneless sound With Echo silent lies. MONODY ON A LADY FAMED FOR HER CAPRICE I How cold is that bosom which Folly once fired! How pale is that cheek where the rouge lately glisten'd! How silent that tongue which the echoes oft tired! How dull is that ear which to flatt'ry so listen'd! II If sorrow and anguish their exit await, From friendship and dearest affection remov'd, How doubly severer, Maria, thy fate! Thou diedst unwept, as thou livedst unlov'd. III Loves, Graces, and Virtues, I call not on you: So shy, grave, and distant, ye shed not a tear. But come, all ye offspring of Folly so true, And flowers let us cull for Maria's cold bier! IV We'll search through the garden for each silly flower, We'll roam thro' the forest for each idle weed, But chiefly the nettle, so typical, shower, For none e'er approach'd her but rued the rash deed. V We'll sculpture the marble, we'll measure the lay: Here Vanity strums on her idiot lyre! There keen Indignation shall dart on his prey, Which spurning Contempt shall redeem from his ire! THE EPITAPH Here lies, now a prey to insulting neglect, What once was a butterfly, gay in life's beam: Want only of wisdom denied her respect, Want only of goodness denied her esteem. FOR MR. WALTER RIDDELL So vile was poor Wat, such a miscreant slave, That the worms ev'n damn'd him when laid in his grave. ‘In his scull there's a famine,’ a starved reptile cries; ‘And his heart, it is poison,’ another replies. ON A NOTED COXCOMB CAPT. WM. RODDICK, OF CORBISTON Light lay the earth on Billie's breast, His chicken heart's so tender; But build a castle on his head— His scull will prop it under. ON CAPT. LASCELLES When Lascelles thought fit from this world to depart, Some friends warmly spoke of embalming his heart. A bystander whispers:—‘Pray don't make so much o't— The subject is poison, no reptile will touch it.’ ON A GALLOWAY LAIRD NOT QUITE SO WISE AS SOLOMON Bless Jesus Christ, O Cardoness, With grateful lifted eyes, Who taught that not the soul alone But body too shall rise! For had He said:—‘The soul alone From death I will deliver,’ Alas! alas! O Cardoness, Then hadst thou lain for ever! ON WM. GRAHAM OF MOSSKNOWE ‘Stop thief!’ Dame Nature call'd to Death, As Willie drew his latest breath: ‘How shall I make a fool again? My choicest model thou hast taen.’ ON JOHN BUSHBY OF TINWALD DOWNS Here lies John Bushby—honest man! Cheat him, Devil—if you can! ON A SUICIDE Here lies in earth a root of Hell Set by the Deil's ain dibble: This worthless body damn'd himsel To save the Lord the trouble. ON A SWEARING COXCOMB Here cursing, swearing Burton lies, A buck, a beau, or ‘Dem my eyes!’ Who in his life did little good, And his last words were:—‘Dem my blood!’ ON AN INNKEEPER NICKNAMED ‘THE MARQUIS’ Here lies a mock Marquis, whose titles were shamm'd. If ever he rise, it will be to be damn'd. ON GRIZZEL GRIMME Here lyes with Dethe auld Grizzel Grimme Lincluden's ugly witche. O Dethe, an' what a taste hast thou Cann lye with siche a bitche! FOR GABRIEL RICHARDSON Here brewer Gabriel's fire's extinct, And empty all his barrels: He's blest—if as he brew'd, he drink— In upright, virtuous morals. ON THE AUTHOR He who of Rankine sang, lies stiff and deid, And a green, grassy hillock hides his heid: Alas! alas! a devilish change indeed!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume III YOUNG PEGGY I Young Peggy blooms our boniest lass: Her blush is like the morning, The rosy dawn the springing grass With early gems adorning; Her eyes outshine the radiant beams That gild the passing shower, And glitter o'er the crystal streams, And cheer each fresh'ning flower. II Her lips, more than the cherries bright— A richer dye has graced them— They charm the admiring gazer's sight, And sweetly tempt to taste them. Her smile is as the evening mild, When feather'd pairs are courting, And little lambkins wanton wild, In playful bands disporting. III Were Fortune lovely Peggy's foe, Such sweetness would relent her: As blooming Spring unbends the brow Of surly, savage Winter. Detraction's eye no aim can gain Her winning powers to lessen, And fretful Envy grins in vain The poison'd tooth to fasten. IV Ye Pow'rs of Honour, Love, and Truth, From ev'ry ill defend her! Inspire the highly-favour'd youth The destinies intend her! Still fan the sweet connubial flame Responsive in each bosom, And bless the dear parental name With many a filial blossom! BONIE DUNDEE I ‘O, whar gat ye that hauver-meal bannock?’ ‘O silly blind body, O, dinna ye see? I gat it frae a young, brisk sodger laddie Between Saint Johnston and bonie Dundee. O, gin I saw the laddie that gae me't! Aft has he doudl'd me up on his knee: May Heaven protect my bonie Scots laddie, And send him hame to his babie and me! II ‘My blessin's upon thy sweet, wee lippie! My blessin's upon thy bonie e'e brie! Thy smiles are sae like my blythe sodger laddie, Thou's ay the dearer and dearer to me! But I'll big a bow'r on yon bonie banks, Whare Tay rins wimplin by sae clear; And I'll cleed thee in the tartan sae fine, And mak thee a man like thy daddie dear.’ TO THE WEAVER'S GIN YE GO Chorus To the weaver's gin ye go, fair maids, To the weaver's gin ye go, I rede you right, gang ne'er at night, To the weaver's gin ye go. I My heart was ance as blythe and free As simmer days were lang; But a bonie, westlin weaver lad Had gart me change my sang. II My mither sent me to the town, To warp a plaiden wab; But the weary, weary warpin o't Has gart me sigh and sab. III A bonie, westlin weaver lad Sat working at his loom; He took my heart, as wi' a net, In every knot and thrum. IV I sat beside my warpin-wheel, And ay I ca'd it roun'; And every shot and every knock, My heart it gae a stoun. V The moon was sinking in the west Wi' visage pale and wan, As my bonie, westlin weaver lad Convoy'd me thro' the glen. VI But what was said, or what was done, Shame fa' me gin I tell; But O! I fear the kintra soon Will ken as weel's mysel! Chorus To the weaver's gin ye go, fair maids, To the weaver's gin ye go, I rede you right, gang ne'er at night, To the weaver's gin ye go. O, WHISTLE AN' I'LL COME TO YE, MY LAD Chorus O, whistle an' I'll come to ye, my lad! O, whistle an' I'll come to ye, my lad! Tho' father an' mother an' a' should gae mad, O, whistle an' I'll come to ye, my lad! I But warily tent when ye come to court me, And come nae unless the back-yett be a-jee; Syne up the back-style, and let naebody see, And come as ye were na comin to me, And come as ye were na comin to me! II At kirk, or at market, whene'er ye meet me, Gang by me as tho' that ye car'd na a flie; But steal me a blink o' your bonie black e'e, Yet look as ye were na lookin to me, Yet look as ye were na lookin to me! III Ay vow and protest that ye care na for me, And whyles ye may lightly my beauty a wee; But court na anither tho' jokin ye be, For fear that she wyle your fancy frae me, For fear that she wyle your fancy frae me! Chorus O, whistle an' I'll come to ye, my lad! O, whistle an' I'll come to ye, my lad! Tho' father an' mother an' a' should gae mad, O, whistle an' I'll come to ye, my lad! I'M O'ER YOUNG TO MARRY YET Chorus I'm o'er young, I'm o'er young, I'm o'er young to marry yet! I'm o'er young, 'twad be a sin To tak me frae my mammie yet. I I am my mammie's ae bairn, Wi' unco folk I weary, Sir, And lying in a man's bed, I'm fley'd it make me eerie, Sir. II Hallowmass is come and gane, The nights are lang in winter, Sir, And you an' I in ae bed— In trowth, I dare na venture, Sir! III Fu' loud and shrill the frosty wind Blaws thro' the leafless timmer, Sir, But if ye come this gate again, I'll aulder be gin simmer, Sir. Chorus I'm o'er young, I'm o'er young, I'm o'er young to marry yet! I'm o'er young, 'twad be a sin To tak me frae my mammie yet. THE BIRKS OF ABERFELDIE Chorus Bonie lassie, will ye go, Will ye go, will ye go? Bonie lassie, will ye go To the birks of Aberfeldie? I Now simmer blinks on flow'ry braes, And o'er the crystal streamlets plays, Come, let us spend the lightsome days In the birks of Aberfeldie! II The little birdies blythely sing, While o'er their heads the hazels hing, Or lightly flit on wanton wing In the birks of Aberfeldie. III The braes ascend like lofty wa's, The foaming stream, deep-roaring, fa's O'er hung with fragrant-spreading shaws, The birks of Aberfeldie. IV The hoary cliffs are crown'd wi' flowers, White o'er the linns the burnie pours, And, rising, weets wi' misty showers The birks of Aberfeldie. V Let Fortune's gifts at random flee, They ne'er shall draw a wish frae me, Supremely blest wi' love and thee In the birks of Aberfeldie. Chorus Bonie lassie, will ye go, Will ye go, will ye go? Bonie lassie, will ye go To the birks of Aberfeldie? M'PHERSON'S FAREWELL Chorus Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, Sae dauntingly gaed he, He play'd a spring, and danc'd it round Below the gallows-tree. I Farewell, ye dungeons dark and strong, The wretch's destinie! M'Pherson's time will not be long On yonder gallows-tree. II O, what is death but parting breath? On many a bloody plain I've dar'd his face, and in this place I scorn him yet again! III Untie these bands from off my hands, And bring to me my sword, And there's no a man in all Scotland But I'll brave him at a word. IV I've liv'd a life of sturt and strife; I die by treacherie: It burns my heart I must depart, And not avengèd be. V Now farewell light, thou sunshine bright, And all beneath the sky! May coward shame distain his name, The wretch that dare not die! Chorus Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, Sae dauntingly gaed he, He play'd a spring, and danc'd it round Below the gallows-tree. MY HIGHLAND LASSIE, O Chorus Within the glen sae bushy, O, Aboon the plain sae rashy, O, I set me down wi' right guid will To sing my Highland lassie, O! I Nae gentle dames, tho' ne'er sae fair, Shall ever be my Muse's care: Their titles a' are empty show— Gie me my Highland lassie, O! II O, were yon hills and vallies mine, Yon palace and yon gardens fine, The world then the love should know I bear my Highland lassie, O! III But fickle Fortune frowns on me, And I maun cross the raging sea; But while my crimson currents flow I'll love my Highland lassie, O. IV Altho' thro' foreign climes I range, I know her heart will never change; For her bosom burns with honour's glow, My faithful Highland lassie, O. V For her I'll dare the billows' roar, For her I'll trace a distant shore, That Indian wealth may lustre throw Around my Highland lassie, O. VI She has my heart, she has my hand, My secret troth and honour's band! 'Till the mortal stroke shall lay me low, I'm thine, my Highland lassie, O! Chorus Farewell the glen sae bushy, O! Farewell the plain sae rashy, O! To other lands I now must go To sing my Highland lassie, O. THO' CRUEL FATE Tho' cruel fate should bid us part Far as the pole and line, Her dear idea round my heart Should tenderly entwine. Tho' mountains rise, and deserts howl, And oceans roar between, Yet dearer than my deathless soul I still would love my Jean. STAY, MY CHARMER I Stay, my charmer, can you leave me? Cruel, cruel to deceive me! Well you know how much you grieve me: Cruel charmer, can you go? Cruel charmer, can you go? II By my love so ill-requited, By the faith you fondly plighted, By the pangs of lovers slighted, Do not, do not leave me so! Do not, do not leave me so! STRATHALLAN'S LAMENT I Thickest night, surround my dwelling! Howling tempests, o'er me rave! Turbid torrents wintry-swelling, Roaring by my lonely cave! Crystal streamlets gently flowing, Busy haunts of base mankind, Western breezes softly blowing, Suit not my distracted mind. II In the cause of Right engagèd, Wrongs injurious to redress, Honour's war we strongly wagèd, But the heavens deny'd success. Ruin's wheel has driven o'er us: Not a hope that dare attend, The wide world is all before us, But a world without a friend. MY HOGGIE I What will I do gin my hoggie die? My joy, my pride, my hoggie! My only beast, I had nae mae, And vow but I was vogie! The lee-lang night we watched the fauld, Me and my faithfu' doggie; We heard nocht but the roaring linn Amang the braes sae scroggie. II But the houlet cry'd frae the castle wa', The blitter frae the boggie, The tod reply'd upon the hill: I trembled for my hoggie. When day did daw, and cocks did craw, The morning it was foggie, An unco tyke lap o'er the dyke, And maist has kill'd my hoggie! JUMPIN JOHN Chorus The lang lad they ca' Jumpin John Beguil'd the bonie lassie! The lang lad they ca' Jumpin John Beguil'd the bonie lassie! I Her daddie forbad, her minnie forbad; Forbidden she wadna be: She wadna trow't, the browst she brew'd Wad taste sae bitterlie! II A cow and a cauf, a yowe and a hauf, And thretty guid shillins and three: A vera guid tocher! a cotter-man's dochter, The lass with the bonie black e'e! Chorus The lang lad they ca' Jumpin John Beguil'd the bonie lassie! The lang lad they ca' Jumpin John Beguil'd the bonie lassie! UP IN THE MORNING EARLY Chorus Up in the morning's no for me, Up in the morning early! When a' the hills are covered wi' snaw, I'm sure it's winter fairly! I Cauld blaws the wind frae east to west, The drift is driving sairly, Sae loud and shrill's I hear the blast— I'm sure it's winter fairly! II The birds sit chittering in the thorn, A' day they fare but sparely; And lang's the night frae e'en to morn— I'm sure it's winter fairly. Chorus Up in the morning's no for me, Up in the morning early! When a' the hills are cover'd wi' snaw, I'm sure it's winter fairly! THE YOUNG HIGHLAND ROVER I Loud blaw the frosty breezes, The snaws the mountains cover. Like winter on me seizes, Since my young Highland rover Far wanders nations over. Where'er he go, where'er he stray, May Heaven be his warden! Return him safe to fair Strathspey And bonie Castle Gordon! II The trees, now naked groaning, Shall soon wi' leaves be hinging, The birdies, dowie moaning, Shall a' be blythely singing, And every flower be springing: Sae I'll rejoice the lee-lang day, When (by his mighty Warden) My youth's return'd to fair Strathspey And bonie Castle Gordon. THE DUSTY MILLER I Hey the dusty miller And his dusty coat! He will spend a shilling Or he win a groat. Dusty was the coat, Dusty was the colour, Dusty was the kiss That I gat frae the miller! II Hey the dusty miller And his dusty sack! Leeze me on the calling Fills the dusty peck! Fills the dusty peck, Brings the dusty siller! I wad gie my coatie For the dusty miller! I DREAM'D I LAY I I dream'd I lay where flowers were springing Gaily in the sunny beam, List'ning to the wild birds singing, By a falling crystal stream; Straight the sky grew black and daring, Thro' the woods the whirlwinds rave, Trees with agèd arms were warring O'er the swelling, drumlie wave. II Such was my life's deceitful morning, Such the pleasures I enjoy'd! But lang or noon loud tempests, storming, A' my flowery bliss destroy'd. Tho' fickle Fortune has deceiv'd me (She promis'd fair, and perform'd but ill), Of monie a joy and hope bereav'd me, I bear a heart shall support me still. DUNCAN DAVISON I There was a lass, they ca'd her Meg, And she held o'er the moors to spin; There was a lad that follow'd her, They ca'd him Duncan Davison. The moor was dreigh, and Meg was skeigh, Her favour Duncan could na win; For wi' the rock she wad him knock, And ay she shook the temper-pin. II As o'er the moor they lightly foor, A burn was clear, a glen was green; Upon the banks they eas'd their shanks, And ay she set the wheel between: But Duncan swoor a haly aith, That Meg should be a bride the morn; Then Meg took up her spinnin-graith, And flang them a' out o'er the burn. III We will big a wee, wee house, And we will live like king and queen, Sae blythe and merry's we will be, When ye set by the wheel at e'en! A man may drink, and no be drunk; A man may fight, and no be slain; A man may kiss a bonie lass, And ay be welcome back again! THENIEL MENZIES' BONIE MARY Chorus Theniel Menzies' bonie Mary, Theniel Menzies' bonie Mary, Charlie Grigor tint his plaidie, Kissin Theniel's bonie Mary! I In comin by the brig o' Dye, At Darlet we a blink did tarry; As day was dawin in the sky, We drank a health to bonie Mary. II Her een sae bright, her brow sae white, Her haffet locks as brown's a berry, And ay they dimpl't wi' a smile, The rosy cheeks o' bonie Mary. III We lap an' danc'd the lee-lang day, Till piper-lads were wae and weary; But Charlie gat the spring to pay, For kissin Theniel's bonie Mary. Chorus Theniel Menzies' bonie Mary, Theniel Menzies' bonie Mary, Charlie Grigor tint his plaidie, Kissin Theniel's bonie Mary! LADY ONLIE, HONEST LUCKY Chorus Lady Onlie, honest lucky, Brews guid ale at shore o' Bucky: I wish her sale for her guid ale, The best on a' the shore o' Bucky! I A' the lads o' Thorniebank, When they gae to the shore o' Bucky, They'll step in an' tak a pint Wi' Lady Onlie, honest lucky. II Her house sae bien, her curch sae clean I wat she is a dainty chuckie, And cheery blinks the ingle-gleede O' Lady Onlie, honest lucky! Chorus Lady Onlie, honest lucky, Brews guid ale at shore o' Bucky: I wish her sale for her guid ale, The best on a' the shore o' Bucky! THE BANKS OF THE DEVON I How pleasant the banks of the clear winding Devon, With green spreading bushes and flow'rs blooming fair! But the boniest flow'r on the banks of the Devon Was once a sweet bud on the braes of the Ayr. Mild be the sun on this sweet blushing flower, In the gay rosy morn, as it bathes in the dew! And gentle the fall of the soft vernal shower, That steals on the evening each leaf to renew! II O, spare the dear blossom, ye orient breezes, With chill, hoary wing as ye usher the dawn! And far be thou distant, thou reptile that seizes The verdure and pride of the garden or lawn! Let Bourbon exult in his gay gilded lilies, And England triumphant display her proud rose! A fairer than either adorns the green vallies, Where Devon, sweet Devon, meandering flows. DUNCAN GRAY I Weary fa' you, Duncan Gray! (Ha, ha, the girdin o't!) Wae gae by you, Duncan Gray! (Ha, ha, the girdin o't!) When a' the lave gae to their play, Then I maun sit the lee-lang day, And jeeg the cradle wi' my tae, And a' for the girdin o't! II Bonie was the Lammas moon (Ha, ha, the girdin o't!), Glowrin a' the hills aboon (Ha, ha, the girdin o't!). The girdin brak, the beast cam down, I tint my curch and baith my shoon, And, Duncan, ye're an unco loun— Wae on the bad girdin o't! III But Duncan, gin ye'll keep your aith (Ha, ha, the girdin o't!), I'se bless you wi' my hindmost breath (Ha, ha, the girdin o't!). Duncan, gin ye'll keep your aith, The beast again can bear us baith, And auld Mess John will mend the skaith And clout the bad girdin o't. THE PLOUGHMAN Chorus Then up wi't a', my ploughman lad, And hey, my merry ploughman! Of a' the trades that I do ken, Commend me to the ploughman! I The ploughman, he's a bonie lad, His mind is ever true, jo! His garters knit below his knee, His bonnet it is blue, jo. II I hae been east, I hae been west, I hae been at St. Johnston; The boniest sight that e'er I saw Was the ploughman laddie dancin. III Snaw-white stockings on his legs And siller buckles glancin, A guid blue bonnet on his head, And O, but he was handsome! IV Commend me to the barn-yard And the corn mou, man! I never got my coggie fou Till I met wi' the ploughman. Chorus Then up wi't a', my ploughman lad, And hey, my merry ploughman! Of a' the trades that I do ken, Commend me to the ploughman! LANDLADY, COUNT THE LAWIN Chorus Hey tutti, taiti, How tutti, taiti, Hey tutti, taiti, Wha's fou now? I Landlady, count the lawin, The day is near the dawin; Ye're a' blind drunk, boys, And I'm but jolly fou. II Cog, an ye were ay fou, Cog, an ye were ay fou, I wad sit and sing to you, If ye were ay fou! III Weel may ye a' be! Ill may ye never see! God bless the king And the companie! Chorus Hey tutti, taiti, How tutti, taiti, Hey tutti, taiti, Wha's fou now? RAVING WINDS AROUND HER BLOWING I Raving winds around her blowing, Yellow leaves the woodlands strowing. By a river hoarsely roaring, Isabella stray'd deploring:— ‘Farewell hours that late did measure Sunshine days of joy and pleasure! Hail, thou gloomy night of sorrow— Cheerless night that knows no morrow! II ‘O'er the Past too fondly wandering, On the hopeless Future pondering, Chilly Grief my life-blood freezes, Fell Despair my fancy seizes. Life, thou soul of every blessing, Load to Misery most distressing, Gladly how would I resign thee, And to dark Oblivion join thee!’ HOW LANG AND DREARY IS THE NIGHT Chorus For O, her lanely nights are lang, And O, her dreams are eerie, And O, her widow'd heart is sair, That's absent frae her dearie! I How lang and dreary is the night, When I am frae my dearie! I restless lie frae e'en to morn, Tho' I were ne'er sae weary. II When I think on the lightsome days I spent wi' thee, my dearie, And now what seas between us roar, How can I be but eerie? III How slow ye move, ye heavy hours! The joyless day how dreary! It was na sae ye glinted by, When I was wi' my dearie! Chorus For O, her lanely nights are lang, And O, her dreams are eerie, And O, her widow'd heart is sair, That's absent frae her dearie! MUSING ON THE ROARING OCEAN I Musing on the roaring ocean, Which divides my love and me, Wearying heav'n in warm devotion For his weal where'er he be: II Hope and Fear's alternate billow Yielding late to Nature's law, Whispering spirits round my pillow, Talk of him that's far awa. III Ye whom sorrow never wounded, Ye who never shed a tear, Care-untroubled, joy-surrounded, Gaudy day to you is dear! IV Gentle night, do thou befriend me! Downy sleep, the curtain draw! Spirits kind, again attend me, Talk of him that's far awa! BLYTHE WAS SHE Chorus Blythe, blythe and merry was she, Blythe was she butt and ben, Blythe by the banks of Earn, And blythe in Glenturit glen! I By Oughtertyre grows the aik, On Yarrow banks the birken shaw; But Phemie was a bonier lass Than braes o' Yarrow ever saw. II Her looks were like a flow'r in May, Her smile was like a simmer morn. She trippèd by the banks o' Earn As light's a bird upon a thorn. III Her bonie face it was as meek As onie lamb upon a lea. The evening sun was ne'er sae sweet As was the blink o' Phemie's e'e. IV The Highland hills I've wander'd wide, As o'er the Lawlands I hae been, But Phemie was the blythest lass That ever trod the dewy green. Chorus Blythe, blythe and merry was she, Blythe was she butt and ben, Blythe by the banks of Earn, And blythe in Glenturit Glen! TO DAUNTON ME Chorus To daunton me, to daunton me, An auld man shall never daunton me! I The blude-red rose at Yule may blaw, The simmer lilies bloom in snaw, The frost may freeze the deepest sea, But an auld man shall never daunton me. II To daunton me, and me sae young, Wi' his fause heart and flatt'ring tongue: That is the thing you ne'er shall see, For an auld man shall never daunton me. III For a' his meal and a' his maut, For a' his fresh beef and his saut, For a' his gold and white moníe, An auld man shall never daunton me. IV His gear may buy him kye and yowes, His gear may buy him glens and knowes; But me he shall not buy nor fee, For an auld man shall never daunton me. V He hirples twa-fauld as he dow, Wi' his teethless gab and his auld beld pow, And the rain rains down frae his red blear'd e'e— That auld man shall never daunton me! Chorus To daunton me, to daunton me, An auld man shall never daunton me! O'ER THE WATER TO CHARLIE Chorus We'll o'er the water, we'll o'er the sea, We'll o'er the water to Charlie! Come weal, come woe, we'll gather and go, And live and die wi' Charlie! I Come boat me o'er, come row me o'er, Come boat me o'er to Charlie! I'll gie John Ross another bawbee To boat me o'er to Charlie. II I lo'e weel my Charlie's name, Tho' some there be abhor him; But O, to see Auld Nick gaun hame, And Charlie's faes before him! III I swear and vow by moon and stars And sun that shines so early, If I had twenty thousand lives, I'd die as aft for Charlie! Chorus We'll o'er the water, we'll o'er the sea, We'll o'er the water to Charlie! Come weal, come woe, we'll gather and go, And live and die wi' Charlie! A ROSE-BUD, BY MY EARLY WALK I A rose-bud, by my early walk Adown a corn-inclosèd bawk, Sae gently bent its thorny stalk, All on a dewy morning. Ere twice the shades o' dawn are fled, In a' its crimson glory spread And drooping rich the dewy head, It scents the early morning. II Within the bush her covert nest A little linnet fondly prest, The dew sat chilly on her breast, Sae early in the morning. She soon shall see her tender brood, The pride, the pleasure o' the wood, Amang the fresh green leaves bedew'd, Awake the early morning. III So thou, dear bird, young Jeany fair, On trembling string or vocal air Shall sweetly pay the tender care That tents thy early morning! So thou, sweet rose-bud, young and gay, Shalt beauteous blaze upon the day, And bless the parent's evening ray That watch'd thy early morning! AND I'LL KISS THEE YET Chorus And I'll kiss thee yet, yet, And I'll kiss thee o'er again, And I'll kiss thee yet, yet, My bonie Peggy Alison. I When in my arms, wi' a' thy charms, I clasp my countless treasure, O, I seek nae mair o' Heav'n to share Than sic a moment's pleasure, O! II And by thy een sae bonie blue I swear I'm thine for ever, O! And on thy lips I seal my vow, And break it shall I never, O! Chorus And I'll kiss thee yet, yet, And I'll kiss thee o'er again, And I'll kiss thee yet, yet, My bonie Peggy Alison RATTLIN, ROARIN WILLIE I O, rattlin, roarin Willie, O, he held to the fair, An' for to sell his fiddle And buy some other ware; But parting wi' his fiddle, The saut tear blin't his e'e— And, rattlin, roarin Willie, Ye're welcome hame to me! II ‘O Willie, come sell your fiddle, O, sell your fiddle sae fine! O Willie come sell your fiddle And buy a pint o' wine!’ ‘If I should sell my fiddle, The warld would think I was mad; For monie a rantin day My fiddle and I hae had.’ III As I cam by Crochallan, I cannily keekit ben, Rattlin, roarin Willie Was sitting at yon boord-en': Sitting at yon boord-en', And amang guid companie! Rattlin, roarin Willie, Ye're welcome hame to me. WHERE, BRAVING ANGRY WINTER'S STORMS I Where, braving angry winter's storms, The lofty Ochils rise, Far in their shade my Peggy's charms First blest my wondering eyes: As one who by some savage stream A lonely gem surveys, Astonish'd doubly, marks it beam With art's most polish'd blaze. II Blest be the wild, sequester'd glade, And blest the day and hour, Where Peggy's charms I first survey'd, When first I felt their pow'r! The tyrant Death with grim control May seize my fleeting breath, But tearing Peggy from my soul Must be a stronger death. O TIBBIE, I HAE SEEN THE DAY Chorus O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, Ye wadna been sae shy! For laik o' gear ye lightly me, But, trowth, I care na by. I Yestreen I met you on the moor, Ye spak na, but gaed by like stoure! Ye geck at me because I'm poor— But fient a hair care I! II When comin hame on Sunday last, Upon the road as I cam past, Ye snufft an' gae your head a cast— But, trowth, I care't na by! III I doubt na, lass, but ye may think, Because ye hae the name o' clink, That ye can please me at a wink, Whene'er ye like to try. IV But sorrow tak him that's sae mean, Altho' his pouch o' coin were clean, Wha follows onie saucy quean, That looks sae proud and high! V Altho' a lad were e'er sae smart, If that he want the yellow dirt, Ye'll cast your head anither airt, And answer him fu' dry. VI But if he hae the name o' gear, Ye'll fasten to him like a brier, Tho' hardly he for sense or lear Be better than the kye. VII But, Tibbie, lass, tak my advice: Your daddie's gear maks you sae nice, The Deil a ane wad spier your price, Were ye as poor as I. VIII There lives a lass beside yon park, I'd rather hae her in her sark Than you wi' a' your thousand mark, That gars you look sae high. Chorus O Tibbie, I hae seen the day, Ye wadna been sae shy! For laik o' gear ye lightly me, But, trowth, I care na by. CLARINDA, MISTRESS OF MY SOUL I Clarinda, mistress of my soul, The measur'd time is run! The wretch beneath the dreary pole So marks his latest sun. II To what dark cave of frozen night Shall poor Sylvander hie, Depriv'd of thee, his life and light, The sun of all his joy? III We part—but, by these precious drops That fill thy lovely eyes, No other light shall guide my steps Till thy bright beams arise! IV She, the fair sun of all her sex, Has blest my glorious day; And shall a glimmering planet fix My worship to its ray? THE WINTER IT IS PAST I The winter it is past, and the simmer comes at last, And the small birds sing on ev'ry tree: The hearts of these are glad, but mine is very sad, For my love is parted from me. II The rose upon the brier by the waters running clear May have charms for the linnet or the bee: Their little loves are blest, and their little hearts at rest, But my lover is parted from me. III My love is like the sun in the firmament does run— Forever is constant and true; But his is like the moon, that wanders up and down, And every month it is new. IV All you that are in love, and cannot it remove, I pity the pains you endure, For experience makes me know that your hearts are full of woe, A woe that no mortal can cure. I LOVE MY LOVE IN SECRET Chorus My Sandy O, my Sandy O, My bonie, bonie Sandy O! Tho' the love that I owe To thee I dare na show, Yet I love my love in secret, My Sandy O! I My Sandy gied to me a ring Was a' beset wi' diamonds fine; But I gied him a far better thing, I gied my heart in pledge o' his ring. II My Sandy brak a piece o' gowd, While down his cheeks the saut tears row'd; He took a hauf, and gied it to me, And I'll keep it till the hour I die. Chorus My Sandy O, my Sandy O, My bonie, bonie Sandy O! Tho' the love that I owe To thee I dare na show, Yet I love my love in secret, My Sandy O! SWEET TIBBIE DUNBAR I O, wilt thou go wi' me, sweet Tibbie Dunbar? O, wilt thou go wi' me, sweet Tibbie Dunbar? Wilt thou ride on a horse, or be drawn in a car, Or walk by my side, O sweet Tibbie Dunbar? II I care na thy daddie, his lands and his money; I care na thy kin, sae high and sae lordly; But say that thou'lt hae me for better or waur, And come in thy coatie, sweet Tibbie Dunbar. HIGHLAND HARRY Chorus O, for him back again! O, for him back again! I wad gie a' Knockhaspie's land For Highland Harry back again. I My Harry was a gallant gay, Fu' stately strade he on the plain, But now he's banish'd far away: I'll never see him back again. II When a' the lave gae to their bed, I wander dowie up the glen, I set me down, and greet my fill, And ay I wish him back again. III O, were some villains hangit high, And ilka body had their ain, Then I might see the joyfu' sight, My Highland Harry back again! Chorus O, for him back again! O, for him back again! I wad gie a' Knockhaspie's land, For Highland Harry back again. THE TAILOR FELL THRO' THE BED I The tailor fell thro' the bed, thimble an' a', The tailor fell thro' the bed, thimble an' a'; The blankets were thin, and the sheets they were sma'— The tailor fell thro' the bed, thimble an' a'! II The sleepy bit lassie, she dreaded nae ill, The sleepy bit lassie, she dreaded nae ill; The weather was cauld, and the lassie lay till: She thought that a tailor could do her nae ill! III Gie me the groat again, cannie young man! Gie me the groat again, cannie young man! The day it is short, and the night it is lang— The dearest siller that ever I wan! IV There's somebody weary wi' lying her lane, There's somebody weary wi' lying her lane! There's some that are dowie, I trow wad be fain To see the bit tailor come skippin again. AY WAUKIN, O Chorus Ay waukin, O, Waukin still and weary: Sleep I can get nane For thinking on my dearie. I Simmer's a pleasant time: Flowers of every colour, The water rins owre the heugh, And I long for my true lover. II When I sleep I dream, When I wauk I'm eerie, Sleep I can get nane For thinkin on my dearie. III Lanely night comes on, A' the lave are sleepin, I think on my bonie lad, And I bleer my een wi' greetin. Chorus Ay waukin, O, Waukin still and weary: Sleep I can get nane For thinking on my dearie. BEWARE O' BONIE ANN I Ye gallants bright, I rede you right, Beware o' bonie Ann! Her comely face sae fu' o' grace, Your heart she will trepan. II Her een sae bright like stars by night, Her skin is like the swan. Sae jimply lac'd her genty waist That sweetly ye might span. III Youth, Grace, and Love attendant move, And Pleasure leads the van: In a' their charms, and conquering arms, They wait on bonie Ann. IV The captive bands may chain the hands. But Love enslaves the man: Ye gallants braw, I rede you a', Beware o' bonie Ann! LADDIE, LIE NEAR ME Chorus Near me, near me, Laddie, lie near me! Lang hae I lain my lane— Laddie, lie near me! I Lang hae we parted been, Laddie, my dearie; Now we are met again— Laddie, lie near me! II A' that I hae endur'd, Laddie, my dearie, Here in thy arms is cur'd— Laddie, lie near me! Chorus Near me, near me, Laddie, lie near me! Lang hae I lain my lane— Laddie, lie near me! THE GARD'NER WI' HIS PAIDLE I When rosy May comes in wi' flowers To deck her gay, green-spreading bowers, Then busy, busy are his hours, The gard'ner wi' his paidle. II The crystal waters gently fa', The merry birds are lovers a', The scented breezes round him blaw— The gard'ner wi' his paidle. III When purple morning starts the hare To steal upon her early fare, Then thro' the dew he maun repair— The gard'ner wi' his paidle. IV When Day, expiring in the west, The curtain draws o' Nature's rest, He flies to her arms he lo'es best, The gard'ner wi' his paidle. ON A BANK OF FLOWERS I On a bank of flowers in a summer day, For summer lightly drest, The youthful, blooming Nelly lay With love and sleep opprest; When Willie, wand'ring thro' the wood, Who for her favour oft had sued— He gaz'd, he wish'd, He fear'd, he blush'd, And trembled where he stood. II Her closèd eyes, like weapons sheath'd, Were seal'd in soft repose; Her lips, still as she fragrant breath'd, It richer dyed the rose; The springing lilies, sweetly prest, Wild-wanton kiss'd her rival breast: He gaz'd, he wish'd, He fear'd, he blush'd, His bosom ill at rest. III Her robes, light-waving in the breeze, Her tender limbs embrace; Her lovely form, her native ease, All harmony and grace. Tumultuous tides his pulses roll, A faltering, ardent kiss he stole: He gaz'd, he wish'd, He fear'd, he blush'd, And sigh'd his very soul. IV As flies the partridge from the brake On fear-inspired wings, So Nelly starting, half-awake, Away affrighted springs. But Willie follow'd—as he should; He overtook her in the wood; He vow'd, he pray'd, He found the maid Forgiving all, and good. THE DAY RETURNS I The day returns, my bosom burns, The blissful day we twa did meet! Tho' winter wild in tempest toil'd, Ne'er summer sun was half sae sweet. Than a' the pride that loads the tide, And crosses o'er the sultry line, Than kingly robes, than crowns and globes, Heav'n gave me more—it made thee mine! II While day and night can bring delight, Or Nature aught of pleasure give, While joys above my mind can move, For thee, and thee alone, I live! When that grim foe of Life below Comes in between to make us part, The iron hand that breaks our band, It breaks my bliss, it breaks my heart! MY LOVE, SHE'S BUT A LASSIE YET Chorus My love, she's but a lassie yet, My love, she's but a lassie yet! We'll let her stand a year or twa, She'll no be half sae saucy yet! I I rue the day I sought her, O! I rue the day I sought her, O! Wha gets her need na say he's woo'd, But he may say he has bought her, O. II Come draw a drap o' the best o't yet, Come draw a drap o' the best o't yet! Gae seek for pleasure whare ye will, But here I never missed it yet. III We're a' dry wi' drinkin o't, We're a' dry wi' drinkin o't! The minister kiss't the fiddler's wife— He could na preach for thinkin o't! Chorus My love, she's but a lassie yet, My love, she's but a lassie yet! We'll let her stand a year or twa, She'll no be half sae saucy yet! JAMIE, COME TRY ME Chorus Jamie, come try me, Jamie, come try me! If thou would win my love, Jamie, come try me! I If thou should ask my love, Could I deny thee? If thou would win my love, Jamie, come try me! II If thou should kiss me, love, Wha could espy thee? If thou wad be my love, Jamie, come try me! Chorus Jamie, come try me, Jamie, come try me! If thou would win my love, Jamie, come try me! THE SILVER TASSIE I Go, fetch to me a pint o' wine, And fill it in a silver tassie, That I may drink before I go A service to my bonie lassie! The boat rocks at the pier o' Leith, Fu' loud the wind blaws frae the Ferry, The ship rides by the Berwick-Law, And I maun leave my bonie Mary. II The trumpets sound, the banners fly, The glittering spears are rankèd ready, The shouts o' war are heard afar, The battle closes deep and bloody. It's not the roar o' sea or shore Wad mak me langer wish to tarry, Nor shouts o' war that's heard afar: It's leaving thee, my bonie Mary! THE LAZY MIST [I] The lazy mist hangs from the brow of the hill, Concealing the course of the dark winding rill. How languid the scenes, late so sprightly, appear, As Autumn to Winter resigns the pale year! II The forests are leafless, the meadows are brown, And all the gay foppery of summer is flown. Apart let me wander, apart let me muse, How quick Time is flying, how keen Fate pursues! III How long I have liv'd, but how much liv'd in vain! How little of life's scanty span may remain! What aspects old Time in his progress has worn! What ties cruel Fate in my bosom has torn! IV How foolish, or worse, till our summit is gain'd! And downward, how weaken'd, how darken'd, how pain'd! Life is not worth having with all it can give: For something beyond it poor man, sure, must live. THE CAPTAIN'S LADY Chorus O, mount and go, Mount and make you ready! O, mount and go, And be the Captain's Lady! I When the drums do beat, And the cannons rattle, Thou shalt sit in state, And see thy love in battle: II When the vanquish'd foe Sues for peace and quiet, To the shades we'll go, And in love enjoy it. Chorus O, mount and go, Mount and make you ready! O, mount and go, And be the Captain's Lady! OF A' THE AIRTS I Of a' the airts the wind can blaw I dearly like the west, For there the bonie lassie lives, The lassie I lo'e best. There wild woods grow, and rivers row, And monie a hill between, But day and night my fancy's flight Is ever wi' my Jean. II I see her in the dewy flowers— I see her sweet and fair. I hear her in the tunefu' birds— I hear her charm the air. There's not a bonie flower that springs By fountain, shaw, or green, There's not a bonie bird that sings, But minds me o' my Jean. CARL, AN THE KING COME Chorus Carl, an the King come, Carl, an the King come, Thou shalt dance, and I will sing, Carl, an the King come! I An somebodie were come again, Then somebodie maun cross the main, And every man shall hae his ain, Carl, an the King come! II I trow we swappèd for the worse: We gae the boot and better horse, And that we'll tell them at the Cross, Carl, an the King come! III Coggie, an the King come, Coggie, an the King come, I'll be fou, and thou 'se be toom, Coggie, an the King come! Chorus Carl, an the King come, Carl, an the King come, Thou shalt dance, and I will sing, Carl, an the King come! WHISTLE O'ER THE LAVE O'T I First when Maggie was my care, Heav'n, I thought, was in her air; Now we're married, spier nae mair, But—whistle o'er the lave o't! Meg was meek, and Meg was mild, Sweet and harmless as a child: Wiser men than me's beguiled— Whistle o'er the lave o't! II How we live, my Meg and me, How we love, and how we gree, I care na by how few may see— Whistle o'er the lave o't! Wha I wish were maggots' meat, Dish'd up in her winding-sheet, I could write (but Meg wad see't)— Whistle o'er the lave o't! O, WERE I ON PARNASSUS HILL I O, were I on Parnassus hill, Or had o' Helicon my fill, That I might catch poetic skill To sing how dear I love thee! But Nith maun be my Muses' well, My Muse maun be thy bonie sel', On Corsincon I'll glowr and spell, And write how dear I love thee. II Then come, sweet Muse, inspire my lay! For a' the lee-lang simmer's day I couldna sing, I couldna say How much, how dear I love thee. I see thee dancing o'er the green, Thy waist sae jimp, thy limbs sae clean, Thy tempting lips, thy roguish een— By Heaven and Earth I love thee! III By night, by day, a-field, at hame, The thoughts o' thee my breast inflame, And ay I muse and sing thy name— I only live to love thee. Tho' I were doom'd to wander on, Beyond the sea, beyond the sun, Till my last weary sand was run, Till then—and then—I'd love thee! THE CAPTIVE RIBBAND I Myra, the captive ribband's mine! 'Twas all my faithful love could gain, And would you ask me to resign The sole reward that crowns my pain? II Go, bid the hero, who has run Thro' fields of death to gather fame— Go, bid him lay his laurels down, And all his well-earn'd praise disclaim! III The ribband shall its freedom lose— Lose all the bliss it had with you!— And share the fate I would impose On thee, wert thou my captive too. IV It shall upon my bosom live, Or clasp me in a close embrace; And at its fortune if you grieve, Retrieve its doom, and take its place. THERE'S A YOUTH IN THIS CITY I There's a youth in this city, it were a great pity That he from our lasses should wander awa'; For he's bonie and braw, weel-favor'd witha', An' his hair has a natural buckle an' a'. II His coat is the hue o' his bonnet sae blue, His fecket is white as the new-driven snaw, His hose they are blae, and his shoon like the slae, And his clear siller buckles, they dazzle us a'. III For beauty and fortune the laddie's been courtin: Weel-featur'd, weel-tocher'd, weel-mounted, an' braw, But chiefly the siller that gars him gang till her— The penny's the jewel that beautifies a'! IV There's Meg wi' the mailen, that fain wad a haen him, And Susie, wha's daddie was laird of the Ha', There's lang-tocher'd Nancy maist fetters his fancy; But the laddie's dear sel he loes dearest of a'. MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS Chorus My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here, My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer, A-chasing the wild deer and following the roe— My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go! I Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North, The birthplace of valour, the country of worth! Wherever I wander, wherever I rove, The hills of the Highlands for ever I love. II Farewell to the mountains high cover'd with snow, Farewell to the straths and green valleys below, Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods, Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods! Chorus My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here, My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer, A-chasing the wild deer and following the roe— My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go! JOHN ANDERSON MY JO I John Anderson my jo, John, When we were first acquent, Your locks were like the raven, Your bonie brow was brent; But now your brow is beld, John, Your locks are like the snaw, But blessings on your frosty pow, John Anderson my jo! II John Anderson my jo, John, We clamb the hill thegither, And monie a cantie day, John, We've had wi' ane anither; Now we maun totter down, John, And hand in hand we'll go, And sleep thegither at the foot, John Anderson my jo! AWA', WHIGS, AWA' Chorus Awa', Whigs, awa'! Awa', Whigs, awa'! Ye're but a pack o' traitor louns, Ye'll do nae guid at a'. I Our thrissles flourish'd fresh and fair, And bonie bloom'd our roses; But Whigs cam like a frost in June, An' wither'd a' our posies. II Our ancient crown's fa'n in the dust— Deil blin' them wi' the stoure o't, An' write their names in his black beuk, Wha gae the Whigs the power o't! III Our sad decay in church and state Surpasses my descriving. The Whigs cam o'er us for a curse, And we hae done wi' thriving. IV Grim Vengeance lang has taen a nap, But we may see him waukin— Gude help the day when Royal heads Are hunted like a maukin! Chorus Awa', Whigs, awa'! Awa', Whigs, awa'! Ye're but a pack o' traitor louns, Ye'll do nae guid at a'. CA' THE YOWES TO THE KNOWES Chorus Ca' the yowes to the knowes, Ca' them where the heather grows, Ca' them where the burnie rowes, My bonie dearie! I As I gaed down the water-side, There I met my shepherd lad: He row'd me sweetly in his plaid, And he ca'd me his dearie. II ‘Will ye gang down the water-side, And see the waves sae sweetly glide Beneath the hazels spreading wide? The moon it shines fu' clearly.’ III ‘I was bred up in nae sic school, My shepherd lad, to play the fool, An' a' the day to sit in dool, An' naebody to see me.’ IV ‘Ye sall get gowns and ribbons meet, Cauf-leather shoon upon your feet, And in my arms thou'lt lie and sleep, An' ye sall be my dearie.’ V ‘If ye'll but stand to what ye've said, I'se gang wi' you, my shepherd lad, And ye may row me in your plaid, And I sall be your dearie.’ VI ‘While waters wimple to the sea, While day blinks in the lift sae hie, Till clay-cauld death sall blin' my e'e, Ye sall be my dearie.’ Chorus Ca' the yowes to the knowes, Ca' them where the heather grows, Ca' them where the burnie rowes, My bonie dearie! O, MERRY HAE I BEEN I O, merry hae I been teethin a heckle, An' merry hae I been shapin a spoon! O, merry hae I been cloutin a kettle, An' kissin my Katie when a' was done! O, a' the lang day I ca' at my hammer, An' a' the lang day I whistle an' sing! O, a' the lang night I cuddle my kimmer, An' a' the lang night as happy's a king! II Bitter in dool, I lickit my winnins O' marrying Bess, to gie her a slave. Blest be the hour she cool'd in her linens, And blythe be the bird that sings on her grave! Come to my arms, my Katie, my Katie, An' come to my arms, and kiss me again! Drucken or sober, here's to thee, Katie, And blest be the day I did it again! A MOTHER'S LAMENT I Fate gave the word—the arrow sped, And pierc'd my darling's heart, And with him all the joys are fled Life can to me impart. By cruel hands the sapling drops, In dust dishonor'd laid: So fell the pride of all my hopes, My age's future shade. II The mother linnet in the brake Bewails her ravish'd young: So I for my lost darling's sake Lament the live-day long. Death, oft I've fear'd thy fatal blow! Now fond I bare my breast! O, do thou kindly lay me low, With him I love at rest! THE WHITE COCKADE Chorus O, he's a ranting, roving lad! He is a brisk an' a bonie lad! Betide what may, I will be wed, And follow the boy wi' the White Cockade! I My love was born in Aberdeen, The boniest lad that e'er was seen; But now he makes our hearts fu' sad— He takes the field wi' his White Cockade. II I'll sell my rock, my reel, my tow, My guid gray mare and hawkit cow, To buy mysel a tartan plaid, To follow the boy wi' the White Cockade. Chorus O, he's a ranting, roving lad! He is a brisk an' a bonie lad! Betide what may, I will be wed, And follow the boy wi' the White Cockade! THE BRAES O' BALLOCHMYLE I The Catrine woods were yellow seen, The flowers decay'd on Catrine lea; Nae lav'rock sang on hillock green, But nature sicken'd on the e'e; Thro' faded groves Maria sang, Hersel in beauty's bloom the while, And aye the wild-wood echoes rang:— ‘Fareweel the braes o' Ballochmyle! II ‘Low in your wintry beds, ye flowers, Again ye'll flourish fresh and fair; Ye birdies, dumb in with'ring bowers, Again ye'll charm the vocal air; But here, alas! for me nae mair Shall birdie charm, or floweret smile: Fareweel the bonie banks of Ayr! Fareweel! fareweel sweet Ballochmyle!’ THE RANTIN DOG, THE DADDIE O'T I O, wha my babie-clouts will buy? O, wha will tent me when I cry? Wha will kiss me where I lie?— The rantin dog, the daddie o't! II O, wha will own he did the faut? O, wha will buy the groanin maut? O, wha will tell me how to ca't?— The rantin dog, the daddie o't! III When I mount the creepie-chair, Wha will sit beside me there? Gie me Rob, I'll seek nae mair— The rantin dog, the daddie o't! IV Wha will crack to me my lane? Wha will mak me fidgin fain? Wha will kiss me o'er again?— The rantin dog, the daddie o't! THOU LINGERING STAR I Thou ling'ring star with less'ning ray, That lov'st to greet the early morn, Again thou usher'st in the day My Mary from my soul was torn. O Mary, dear departed shade! Where is thy place of blissful rest? See'st thou thy lover lowly laid? Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast? II That sacred hour can I forget, Can I forget the hallow'd grove, Where, by the winding Ayr, we met To live one day of parting love? Eternity cannot efface Those records dear of transports past, Thy image at our last embrace— Ah! little thought we 'twas our last! III Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore, O'erhung with wild woods thickening green; The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar 'Twin'd amorous round the raptur'd scene; The flowers sprang wanton to be prest, The birds sang love on every spray, Till too, too soon, the glowing west Proclaim'd the speed of wingèd day. IV Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes, And fondly broods with miser-care. Time but th'impression stronger makes, As streams their channels deeper wear. O Mary, Dear departed shade! Where is thy place of blissful rest? See'st thou thy lover lowly laid? Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast? EPPIE ADAIR Chorus An' O my Eppie, My jewel, my Eppie! Wha wadna be happy Wi' Eppie Adair? I By love and beauty, By law and by duty, I swear to be true to My Eppie Adair! II A' pleaure exile me, Dishonour defile me, If e'er I beguile thee, My Eppie Adair! Chorus An' O my Eppie, My jewel, my Eppie! Wha wadna be happy Wi' Eppie Adair? THE BATTLE OF SHERRAMUIR I ‘O, cam ye here the fight to shun, Or herd the sheep wi' me, man? Or were ye at the Sherra-moor, Or did the battle see, man?’ ‘I saw the battle, sair and teugh, And reekin-red ran monie a sheugh; My heart for fear gae sough for sough, To hear the thuds, and see the cluds O' clans frae woods in tartan duds, Wha glaum'd at kingdoms three, man. II ‘The red-coat lads wi' black cockauds To meet them were na slaw, man: They rush'd and push'd and bluid outgush'd, And monie a bouk did fa', man! The great Argyle led on his files, I wat they glanc'd for twenty miles; They hough'd the clans like nine-pin kyles, They hack'd and hash'd, while braid-swords clash'd, And thro' they dash'd, and hew'd and smash'd, Till fey men died awa, man. III ‘But had ye seen the philibegs And skyrin tartan trews, man, When in the teeth they daur'd our Whigs And Covenant truebles, man! In lines extended lang and large, When baig'nets o'erpower'd the targe, And thousands hasten'd to the charge, Wi' Highland wrath they frae the sheath Drew blades o' death, till out o' breath They fled like frighted dows, man!’ IV ‘O, how Deil! Tam, can that be true? The chase gaed frae the north, man! I saw mysel, they did pursue The horseman back to Forth, man; And at Dunblane, in my ain sight, They took the brig wi' a' their might, And straught to Stirling wing'd their flight; But, cursed lot! the gates were shut, And monie a huntit poor red-coat, For fear amaist did swarf, man!’ V ‘My sister Kate cam up the gate Wi' crowdie unto me, man: She swoor she saw some rebels run To Perth and to Dundee, man! Their left-hand general had nae skill; The Angus lads had nae good will That day their neebors' bluid to spill; For fear by foes that they should lose Their cogs o' brose, they scar'd at blows, And hameward fast did flee, man. VI ‘They've lost some gallant gentlemen, Amang the Highland clans, man! I fear my Lord Panmure is slain, Or in his en'mies' hands, man. Now wad ye sing this double flight, Some fell for wrang, and some for right, But monie bade the world guid-night: Say, pell and mell, wi' muskets' knell How Tories fell, and Whigs to Hell Flew off in frighted bands, man!’ YOUNG JOCKIE WAS THE BLYTHEST LAD I Young Jockie was the blythest lad, In a' our town or here awa: Fu' blythe he whistled at the gaud, Fu' lightly danc'd he in the ha'. II He roos'd my een sae bonie blue, He roos'd my waist sae genty sma'; An' ay my heart cam to my mou', When ne'er a body heard or saw. III My Jockie toils upon the plain Thro' wind and weet, thro' frost and snaw; And o'er the lea I leuk fu' fain, When Jockie's owsen hameward ca'. IV An' ay the night comes round again, When in his arms he taks me a', An' ay he vows he'll be my ain As lang's he has a breath to draw. A WAUKRIFE MINNIE I ‘Whare are you gaun, my bonie lass? Whare are you gaun, my hinnie?’ She answer'd me right saucilie:— ‘An errand for my minnie!’ II ‘O, whare live ye, my bonie lass? O, whare live ye, my hinnie?’ ‘By yon burnside, gin ye maun ken, In a wee house wi' my minnie!’ III But I foor up the glen at e'en To see my bonie lassie, And lang before the grey morn cam She was na hauf sae saucy. IV O, weary fa' the waukrife cock, And the foumart lay his crawin! He wauken'd the auld wife frae her sleep A wee blink or the dawin. V An angry wife I wat she raise, And o'er the bed she brought her, And wi' a meikle hazel-rung She made her a weel-pay'd dochter. VI ‘O, fare-thee-weel, my bonie lass! O, fare-thee-weel, my hinnie! Thou art a gay and a bonie lass, But thou has a waukrife minnie!’ THO' WOMEN'S MINDS Chorus For a' that, an' a' that, And twice as meikle's a' that, The bonie lass that I loe best, She'll be my ain for a' that! I Tho' women's minds like winter winds May shift, and turn, an' a' that, The noblest breast adores them maist— A consequence, I draw that. II Great love I bear to a' the fair, Their humble slave, an' a' that; But lordly will, I hold it still A mortal sin to thraw that. III In rapture sweet this hour we meet, Wi' mutual love an' a' that, But for how lang the flie may stang, Let inclination law that! IV Their tricks an' craft hae put me daft, They've taen me in an' a' that, But clear your decks, and here's:—‘The Sex!’ I like the jads for a' that! Chorus For a' that, an' a' that, And twice as meikle's a' that, The bonie lass that I loe best, She'll be my ain for a' that! WILLIE BREW'D A PECK O' MAUT Chorus We are na fou, we're nae that fou, But just a drappie in our e'e! The cock may craw, the day may daw, And ay we'll taste the barley-bree! I O, Willie brewed a peck o' maut, And Rob and Allan cam to see. Three blyther hearts that lee-lang night Ye wad na found in Christendie. II Here are we met three merry boys, Three merry boys I trow are we; And monie a night we've merry been, And monie mae we hope to be! III It is the moon, I ken her horn, That's blinkin in the lift sae hie: She shines sae bright to wyle us hame, But, by my sooth, she'll wait a wee! IV Wha first shall rise to gang awa, A cuckold, coward loun is he! Wha first beside his chair shall fa', He is the King amang us three! Chorus We are na fou, we're nae that fou, But just a drappie inn our e'e! The cock may craw, the day may daw, And ay we'll taste the barley-bree! KILLIECRANKIE Chorus An ye had been whare I hae been, Ye wad na been sae cantie, O! An ye had seen what I hae seen On the braes o' Killiecrankie, O! I ‘Whare hae ye been sae braw, lad? Whare hae ye been sae brankie, O? Whare hae ye been sae braw, lad? Cam ye by Killiecrankie, O?’ II ‘I faught at land, I faught at sea, At hame I faught my auntie, O; But I met the Devil and Dundee On the braes o' Killiecrankie, O. III ‘The bauld Pitcur fell in a furr, An' Clavers gat a clankie, O, Or I had fed an Athole gled On the braes o' Killiecrankie, O!’ Chorus An ye had been whare I hae been, Ye wad na been sae cantie, O! An ye had seen what I hae seen On the braes o' Killiecrankie, O! THE BLUE-EYED LASSIE I I gaed a waefu' gate yestreen, A gate I fear I'll dearly rue: I gat my death frae twa sweet een, Twa lovely een o' bonie blue! 'Twas not her golden ringlets bright, Her lips like roses wat wi' dew, Her heaving bosom lily-white: It was her een sae bonie blue. II She talk'd, she smil'd, my heart she wyl'd, She charm'd my soul I wist na how; And ay the stound, the deadly wound, Cam frae her een sae bonie blue. But ‘spare to speak, and spare to speed’— She'll aiblins listen to my vow: Should she refuse, I'll lay my dead To her twa een sae bonie blue. THE BANKS OF NITH I The Thames flows proudly to the sea, Where royal cities stately stand; But sweeter flows the Nith to me, Where Cummins ance had high command. When shall I see that honor'd land, That winding stream I love so dear? Must wayward Fortune's adverse hand For ever—ever keep me here? II How lovely, Nith, thy fruitful vales, Where bounding hawthorns gaily bloom, And sweetly spread thy sloping dales, Where lambkins wanton thro' the broom! Tho' wandering now must be my doom Far from thy bonie banks and braes, May there my latest hours consume Amang my friends of early days! TAM GLEN I My heart is a-breaking, dear tittie, Some counsel unto me come len' To anger them a' is a pity, But what will I do wi' Tam Glen? II I'm thinking, wi' sic a braw fellow In poortith I might mak a fen'. What care I in riches to wallow, If I mauna marry Tam Glen? III There's Lowrie the laird o' Dumeller: ‘Guid day to you,’ brute! he comes ben. He brags and he blaws o' his siller, But when will he dance like Tam Glen? IV My minnie does constantly deave me, And bids me beware o' young men. They flatter, she says, to deceive me— But wha can think sae o' Tam Glen? V My daddie says, gin I'll forsake him, He'd gie me guid hunder marks ten. But if it's ordain'd I maun take him, O, wha will I get but Tam Glen? VI Yestreen at the valentines' dealing, My heart to my mou gied a sten, For thrice I drew ane without failing, And thrice it was written ‘Tam Glen’! VII The last Halloween I was waukin My droukit sark-sleeve, as ye ken— His likeness came up the house staukin, And the very grey breeks o' Tam Glen! VIII Come, counsel, dear tittie, don't tarry! I'll gie ye my bonie black hen, Gif ye will advise me to marry The lad I lo'e dearly, Tam Glen. CRAIGIEBURN WOOD Chorus Beyond thee, dearie, beyond thee, dearie, And O, to be lying beyond thee! O, sweetly, soundly, weel may he sleep That's laid in the bed beyond thee! I Sweet closes the ev'ning on Craigieburn Wood And blythely awaukens the morrow; But the pride o' the spring on the Craigieburn Wood Can yield me naught but sorrow. II I see the spreading leaves and flowers, I hear the wild birds singing; But pleasure they hae nane for me, While care my heart is wringing. III I can na tell, I maun na tell, I daur na for your anger; But secret love will break my heart, If I conceal it langer. IV I see thee gracefu', straight, and tall, I see thee sweet and bonie; But O, what will my torment be, If thou refuse thy Johnie! V To see thee in another's arms In love to lie and languish, 'Twad be my dead, that will be seen— My heart wad burst wi' anguish! VI But, Jeanie, say thou wilt be mine, Say thou lo'es nane before me, And a' my days o' life to come I'll gratefully adore thee. Chorus Beyond thee, dearie, beyond thee, dearie, And O, to be lying beyond thee! O, sweetly, soundly, weel may he sleep That's laid in the bed beyond thee! FRAE THE FRIENDS AND LAND I LOVE I Frae the friends and land I love Driv'n by Fortune's felly spite, Frae my best belov'd I rove, Never mair to taste delight! Never mair maun hope to find Ease frae toil, relief frae care. When remembrance wracks the mind, Pleasures but unveil despair. II Brightest climes shall mirk appear, Desert ilka blooming shore, Till the Fates, nae mair severe, Friendship, love, and peace restore; Till Revenge wi' laurell'd head Bring our banish'd hame again, And ilk loyal, bonie lad Cross the seas, and win his ain! O JOHN, COME KISS ME NOW Chorus O John, come kiss me now, now, now! O John, my love, come kiss me now! O John, come kiss me by and by, For weel ye ken the way to woo! I O, some will court and compliment, And ither some will kiss and daut; But I will mak o' my guidman, My ain guidman—it is nae faut! II O, some will court and compliment, And ither some will prie their mou', And some will hause in ither's arms, And that's the way I like to do! Chorus O John, come kiss me now, now, now! O John, my love, come kiss me now! O John, come kiss me by and by, For weel ye ken the way to woo! COCK UP YOUR BEAVER I When first my brave Johnie lad came to this town, He had a blue bonnet that wanted the crown, But now he has gotten a hat and a feather— Hey, brave Johnie lad, cock up your beaver! II Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu' sprush! We'll over the border and gie them a brush: There's somebody there we'll teach better behaviour— Hey, brave Johnie lad, cock up your beaver! MY TOCHER'S THE JEWEL I O, meikle thinks my luve o' my beauty, And meikle thinks my luve o' my kin; But little thinks my luve I ken brawlie My tocher's the jewel has charms for him. It's a' for the apple he'll nourish the tree, It's a' for the hiney he'll cherish the bee! My laddie's sae meikle in luve wi' the siller, He canna hae luve to spare for me! II Your proffer o' luve's an airle-penny, My tocher's the bargain ye wad buy; But an ye be crafty, I am cunnin, Sae ye wi' anither your fortune may try. Ye're like to the timmer o' yon rotten wood, Ye're like to the bark o' yon rotten tree: Ye'll slip frae me like a knotless thread, An' ye'll crack ye're credit wi' mair nor me! GUIDWIFE, COUNT THE LAWIN Chorus Then, guidwife, count the lawin, The lawin, the lawin! Then, guidwife, count the lawin, And bring a coggie mair! I Gane is the day, and mirk's the night, But we'll ne'er stray for faut o' light, For ale and brandy's stars and moon, And blude-red wine's the risin sun. II There's wealth and ease for gentlemen, And semple folk maun fecht and fen'; But here we're a' in ae accord, For ilka man that's drunk's a lord. III My coggie is a haly pool, That heals the wounds o' care and dool, And Pleasure is a wanton trout: An ye drink it a', ye'll find him out! Chorus Then, guidwife, count the lawin, The lawin, the lawin! Then, guidwife, count the lawin, And bring a coggie mair! THERE'LL NEVER BE PEACE TILL JAMIE COMES HAME I By yon castle wa' at the close of the day, I heard a man sing, tho' his head it was grey, And as he was singing, the tears doon came:— ‘There'll never be peace till Jamie comes hame! II ‘The Church is in ruins, the State is in jars, Delusions, oppressions, and murderous wars, We dare na weel say't, but we ken wha's to blame— There'll never be peace till Jamie comes hame! III ‘My seven braw sons for Jamie drew sword, But now I greet round their green beds in the yerd; It brak the sweet heart o' my faithfu' auld dame— There'll never be peace till Jamie comes hame! IV ‘Now life is a burden that bows me down, Sin I tint my bairns, and he tint his crown; But till my last moments my words are the same— There'll never be peace till Jamie comes hame!’ WHAT CAN A YOUNG LASSIE I What can a young lassie, What shall a young lassie, What can a young lassie Do wi' an auld man? Bad luck on the penny That tempted my minnie To sell her puir Jenny For siller an' lan'! II He's always compleenin Frae mornin to eenin; He hoasts and he hirples The weary day lang; He's doylt and he's dozin; His blude it is frozen— O, dreary's the night Wi' a crazy auld man! III He hums and he hankers, He frets and he cankers, I never can please him Do a' that I can. He's peevish an' jealous Of a' the young fellows— O, dool on the day I met wi' an auld man! IV My auld auntie Katie Upon me taks pity, I'll do my endeavour To follow her plan: I'll cross him an' wrack him Until I heartbreak him, And then his auld brass Will buy me a new pan. THE BONIE LAD THAT'S FAR AWA I O, how can I be blythe and glad, Or how can I gang brisk and braw, When the bonie lad that I lo'e best Is o'er the hills and far awa? II It's no the frosty winter wind, It's no the driving drift and snaw; But ay the tear comes in my e'e To think on him that's far awa. III My father pat me frae his door, My friends they hae disown'd me a'; But I hae ane will tak my part— The bonie lad that's far awa. IV A pair o' glooves he bought to me, And silken snoods he gae me twa, And I will wear them for his sake, The bonie lad that's far awa. V O, weary Winter soon will pass, And Spring will cleed the birken shaw, And my sweet babie will be born, And he'll be hame that's far awa! I DO CONFESS THOU ART SAE FAIR I I do confess thou art sae fair, I wad been o'er the lugs in luve, Had I na found the slightest prayer That lips could speak thy heart could muve. I do confess thee sweet, but find Thou art so thriftless o' thy sweets, Thy favours are the silly wind That kisses ilka thing it meets. II See yonder rosebud rich in dew, Amang its native briers sae coy, How sune it tines its scent and hue, When pu'd and worn a common toy! Sic fate ere lang shall thee betide, Tho' thou may gaily bloom awhile, And sune thou shalt be thrown aside, Like onie common weed, an' vile. SENSIBILITY HOW CHARMING I Sensibility how charming, Thou, my friend, can'st truly tell! But Distress with horrors arming Thou alas! hast known too well! II Fairest flower, behold the lily Blooming in the sunny ray: Let the blast sweep o'er the valley, See it prostrate in the clay. III Hear the woodlark charm the forest, Telling o'er his little joys; But alas! a prey the surest To each pirate of the skies! IV Dearly bought the hidden treasure Finer feelings can bestow: Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure Thrill the deepest notes of woe. YON WILD MOSSY MOUNTAINS I Yon wild mossy mountains sae lofty and wide, That nurse in their bosom the youth o' the Clyde, Where the grouse lead their coveys thro' the heather to feed, And the shepherd tents his flock as he pipes on his reed. II Not Gowrie's rich valley nor Forth's sunny shores To me hae the charms o' yon wild, mossy moors; For there, by a lanely, sequesterèd stream, Resides a sweet lassie, my thought and my dream. III Amang thae wild mountains shall still be my path, Ilk stream foaming down its ain green, narrow strath; For there wi' my lassie the lang day I rove, While o'er us unheeded flie the swift hours o' love. IV She is not the fairest, altho' she is fair; O' nice education but sma' is her share; Her parentage humble as humble can be; But I lo'e the dear lassie because she lo'es me. V To Beauty what man but maun yield him a prize, In her armour of glances, and blushes, and sighs? And when Wit and Refinement hae polish'd her darts, They dazzle our een, as they flie to our hearts. VI But kindness, sweet kindness, in the fond-sparkling e'e Has lustre outshining the diamond to me, And the heart beating love as I'm clasp'd in her arms, O, these are my lassie's all-conquering charms! I HAE BEEN AT CROOKIEDEN I I hae been at Crookieden— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! Viewing Willie and his men— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! There our foes that burnt and slew— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! There at last they gat their due— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! II Satan sits in his black neuk— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! Breaking sticks to roast the Duke— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! The bloody monster gae a yell— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! And loud the laugh gaed round a' Hell— My bonie laddie, Highland laddie! IT IS NA, JEAN, THY BONIE FACE I It is na, Jean, thy bonie face Nor shape that I admire, Altho' thy beauty and thy grace Might weel awauk desire. Something in ilka part o' thee To praise, to love, I find; But, dear as is thy form to me, Still dearer is thy mind. II Nae mair ungen'rous wish I hae, Nor stronger in my breast, Than, if I canna mak thee sae, At least to see thee blest: Content am I, if Heaven shall give But happiness to thee, And, as wi' thee I wish to live, For thee I'd bear to dee. MY EPPIE MACNAB I O, saw ye my dearie, my Eppie Macnab? O, saw ye my dearie, my Eppie Macnab? ‘She's down in the yard, she's kissin the laird, She winna come hame to her ain Jock Rab!’ II O, come thy ways to me, my Eppie Macnab! O, come thy ways to me, my Eppie Macnab! Whate'er thou has done, be it late, be it soon, Thou's welcome again to thy ain Jock Rab. III What says she, my dearie, my Eppie Macnab? What says she, my dearie, my Eppie Macnab? ‘She lets thee to wit that she has thee forgot, And for ever disowns thee, her ain Jock Rab.’ IV O, had I ne'er seen thee, my Eppie Macnab! O, had I ne'er seen thee, my Eppie Macnab! As light as the air and as fause as thou's fair, Thou's broken the heart o' thy ain Jock Rab! WHA IS THAT AT MY BOWER DOOR I ‘Wha is that at my bower door?’ ‘O, wha is it but Findlay!’ ‘Then gae your gate, ye 'se nae be here.’ ‘Indeed maun I!’ quo' Findlay. ‘What mak ye, sae like a thief?’ ‘O, come and see!’ quo' Findlay. ‘Before the morn ye'll work mischief?’ ‘Indeed will I!’ quo' Findlay. II ‘Gif I rise and let you in’— ‘Let me in!’ quo' Findlay— ‘Ye'll keep me wauken wi' your din?’ ‘Indeed will I!’ quo' Findlay. ‘In my bower if ye should stay’— ‘Let me stay!’ quo' Findlay— ‘I fear ye'll bide till break o' day?’ ‘Indeed will I!’ quo' Findlay. III ‘Here this night if ye remain’— ‘I'll remain!’ quo' Findlay— ‘I dread ye'll learn the gate again?’ ‘Indeed will I!’ quo' Findlay. ‘What may pass within this bower’ (‘Let it pass!’ quo' Findlay!) ‘Ye maun conceal till your last hour’— ‘Indeed will I!’ quo' Findlay. BONIE WEE THING Chorus Bonie wee thing, cannie wee thing, Lovely wee thing, wert thou mine, I wad wear thee in my bosom Lest my jewel it should tine. I Wishfully I look and languish In that bonie face o' thine, And my heart it stounds wi' anguish, Lest my wee thing be na mine. II Wit and Grace and Love and Beauty In ae constellation shine! To adore thee is my duty, Goddess o' this soul o' mine! Chorus Bonie wee thing, cannie wee thing, Lovely wee thing, wert thou mine, I wad wear thee in my bosom Lest my jewel it should tine. THE TITHER MORN I The tither morn, when I forlorn Aneath an aik sat moaning, I did na trow I'd see my jo Beside me gin the gloaming. But he sae trig lap o'er the rig, And dawtingly did cheer me, When I, what reck, did least expeck To see my lad sae near me! II His bonnet he a thought ajee Cock'd spunk when first he clasp'd me; And I, I wat, wi' fainness grat, While in his grips he press'd me. ‘Deil tak the war!’ I late and air Hae wish'd since Jock departed; But now as glad I'm wi' my lad As short syne broken-hearted. III Fu' aft at e'en, wi' dancing keen, When a' were blythe and merry, I car'd na by, sae sad was I In absence o' my deary. But praise be blest! my mind's at rest, I'm happy wi' my Johnie! At kirk and fair, I 'se ay be there, And be as canty's onie. AE FOND KISS I Ae fond kiss, and then we sever! Ae farewell, and then forever! Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee. Who shall say that Fortune grieves him, While the star of hope she leaves him? Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me, Dark despair around benights me. II I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy: Naething could resist my Nancy! But to see her was to love her, Love but her, and love for ever. Had we never lov'd sae kindly, Had we never lov'd sae blindly, Never met—or never parted— We had ne'er been broken-hearted. III Fare-thee-weel, thou first and fairest! Fare-thee-weel, thou best and dearest! Thine be ilka joy and treasure, Peace, Enjoyment, Love and Pleasure! Ae fond kiss, and then we sever! Ae farewell, alas, for ever! Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee. LOVELY DAVIES I O, how shall I, unskilfu', try The Poet's occupation? The tunefu' Powers, in happy hours That whisper inspiration, Even they maun dare an effort mair Than aught they ever gave us, Ere they rehearse in equal verse The charms o' lovely Davies. II Each eye, it cheers, when she appears, Like Phœbus in the morning, When past the shower, and every flower The garden is adorning! As the wretch looks o'er Siberia's shore, When winter-bound the wave is, Sae droops our heart, when we maun part Frae charming, lovely Davies. III Her smile's a gift frae 'boon the lift, That maks us mair than princes. A sceptred hand, a king's command, Is in her darting glances. The man in arms 'gainst female charms, Even he her willing slave is: He hugs his chain, and owns the reign Of conquering lovely Davies. IV My Muse to dream of such a theme Her feeble powers surrenders; The eagle's gaze alone surveys The sun's meridian splendours. I wad in vain essay the strain— The deed too daring brave is! I'll drap the lyre, and, mute, admire The charms o' lovely Davies. THE WEARY PUND O' TOW Chorus The weary pund, the weary pund, The weary pund o' tow! I think my wife will end her life Before she spin her tow. I I bought my wife a stane o' lint As guid as e'er did grow, And a' that she has made o' that Is ae puir pund o' tow. II There sat a bottle in a bole Beyont the ingle low; And ay she took the tither souk To drouk the stourie tow. III Quoth I:—‘For shame, ye dirty dame, Gae spin your tap o' tow!’ She took the rock, and wi' a knock She brake it o'er my pow. IV At last her feet—I sang to see't!— Gaed foremost o'er the knowe, And or I wad anither jad, I'll wallop in a tow. Chorus The weary pund, the weary pund, The weary pund o' tow! I think my wife will end her life Before she spin her tow. I HAE A WIFE O' MY AIN I I hae a wife o' my ain, I'll partake wi' naebody: I'll take cuckold frae nane, I'll gie cuckold to naebody. II I hae a penny to spend, There—thanks to naebody! I hae naething to lend, I'll borrow frae naebody. III I am naebody's lord, I'll be slave to naebody. I hae a guid braid sword, I'll tak dunts frae naebody. IV I'll be merry and free, I'll be sad for naebody. Naebody cares for me, I care for naebody. WHEN SHE CAM BEN, SHE BOBBED I O, when she cam ben, she bobbéd fu' law! O, when she cam ben, she bobbéd fu' law! And when she cam' ben, she kiss'd Cockpen, And syne she deny'd she did it at a'! II And was na Cockpen right saucy witha'? And was na Cockpen right saucy witha', In leaving the dochter o' a lord, And kissin a collier lassie an' a'? III O, never look down, my lassie, at a'! O, never look down, my lassie, at a'! Thy lips are as sweet, and thy figure complete, As the finest dame in castle or ha'. IV ‘Tho' thou hast nae silk, and holland sae sma', Tho' thou hast nae silk, and holland sae sma', Thy coat and thy sark are thy ain handywark, And Lady Jean was never sae braw.’ O, FOR ANE-AND-TWENTY, TAM Chorus An' O, for ane-and-twenty, Tam! And hey, sweet ane-and-twenty, Tam! I'll learn my kin a rattlin sang An I saw ane-and-twenty, Tam. I They snool me sair, and haud me down, And gar me look like bluntie, Tam; But three short years will soon wheel roun'— And then comes ane-and-twenty, Tam! II A gleib o' lan', a claut o' gear Was left me by my auntie, Tam. At kith or kin I needna spier, An I saw ane-and-twenty, Tam. III They'll hae me wed a wealthy coof, Tho' I mysel hae plenty, Tam; But hear'st thou, laddie—there's my loof: I'm thine at ane-and-twenty, Tam! Chorus An' O, for ane-and-twenty, Tam! And hey, sweet ane-and-twenty, Tam! I'll learn my kin a rattlin sang An I saw ane-and-twenty, Tam. O, KENMURE'S ON AND AWA, WILLIE I O, Kenmure's on and awa, Willie, O, Kenmure's on and awa! An' Kenmure's lord's the bravest lord That ever Galloway saw! II Success to Kenmure's band, Willie, Success to Kenmure's band! There's no a heart that fears a Whig That rides by Kenmure's hand. III Here's Kenmure's health in wine, Willie, Here's Kenmure's health in wine! There ne'er was a coward o' Kenmure's blude, Nor yet o' Gordon's line. IV O, Kenmure's lads are men, Willie, O, Kenmure's lads are men! Their hearts and swords are metal true, And that their faes shall ken. V They'll live or die wi' fame, Willie, They'll live or die wi' fame! But soon wi' sounding Victorie May Kenmure's lord come hame! VI Here's him that's far awa, Willie, Here's him that's far awa! And here's the flower that I lo'e best— The rose that's like the snaw! O, LEEZE ME ON MY SPINNIN-WHEEL I O, leeze me on my spinnin-wheel! And leeze me on my rock and reel, Frae tap to tae that cleeds me bien, And haps me fiel and warm at e'en! I'll set me down, and sing and spin, While laigh descends the summer sun, Blest wi' content, and milk and meal— O, leeze me on my spinnin-wheel! II On ilka hand the burnies trot, And meet below my theekit cot. The scented birk and hawthorn white Across the pool their arms unite, Alike to screen the birdie's nest And little fishes' caller rest. The sun blinks kindly in the biel, Where blythe I turn my spinnin-wheel. III On lofty aiks the cushats wail, And Echo cons the doolfu' tale. The lintwhites in the hazel braes, Delighted, rival ither's lays. The craik amang the claver hay, The paitrick whirrin o'er the ley, The swallow jinkin round my shiel, Amuse me at my spinnin-wheel. IV Wi' sma to sell and less to buy, Aboon distress, below envý, O, wha wad leave this humble state For a' the pride of a' the great? Amid their flaring, idle toys, Amid their cumbrous, dinsome joys, Can they the peace and pleasure feel Of Bessy at her spinnin-wheel? MY COLLIER LADDIE I ‘O, whare live ye, my bonie lass, And tell me how they ca' ye?’ ‘My name,’ she says, ‘is Mistress Jean, And I follow the collier laddie.’ II ‘O, see you not yon hills and dales The sun shines on sae brawlie? They a' are mine, and they shall be thine, Gin ye'll leave your collier laddie! III ‘An' ye shall gang in gay attire, Weel buskit up sae gaudy, And ane to wait on every hand, Gin ye'll leave your collier laddie!’ IV ‘Tho' ye had a' the sun shines on, And the earth conceals sae lowly, I wad turn my back on you and it a', And embrace my collier laddie. V ‘I can win my five pennies in a day, An' spend it at night fu' brawlie, And make my bed in the collier's neuk And lie down wi' my collier laddie. VI ‘Loove for loove is the bargain for me, Tho' the wee cot-house should haud me, And the warld before me to win my bread— And fair fa' my collier laddie!’ NITHSDALE'S WELCOME HAME I The noble Maxwells and their powers Are coming o'er the border; And they'll gae big Terreagles' towers, And set them a' in order; And they declare Terreagles fair, For their abode they choose it: There's no a heart in a' the land But's lighter at the news o't! II Tho' stars in skies may disappear, And angry tempests gather, The happy hour may soon be near That brings us pleasant weather; The weary night o' care and grief May hae a joyfu' morrow; So dawning day has brought relief— Fareweel our night o' sorrow! IN SIMMER, WHEN THE HAY WAS MAWN I In simmer, when the hay was mawn And corn wav'd green in ilka field, While claver blooms white o'er the ley, And roses blaw in ilka bield, Blythe Bessie in the milking shiel Says:—‘I'll be wed, come o't what will!’ Out spake a dame in wrinkled eild:— ‘O' guid advisement comes nae ill. II ‘It's ye hae wooers monie ane, And lassie, ye're but young, ye ken! Then wait a wee, and cannie wale A routhie butt, a routhie ben. There Johnie o' the Buskie-Glen, Fu' is his barn, fu' is his byre. Tak this frae me, my bonie hen: It's plenty beets the luver's fire!’ III ‘For Johnie o' the Buskie-Glen I dinna care a single flie: He lo'es sae weel his craps and kye, He has nae love to spare for me. But blythe's the blink o' Robie's e'e, And weel I wat he lo'es me dear: Ae blink o' him I wad na gie For Buskie-Glen and a' his gear.’ IV ‘O thoughtless lassie, life's a faught! The canniest gate, the strife is sair. But ay fu'-han't is fechtin best: A hungry care's an unco care. But some will spend, and some will spare, An' wilfu' folk maun hae their will. Syne as ye brew, my maiden fair, Keep mind that ye maun drink the yill!’ V ‘O, gear will buy me rigs o' land, And gear will buy me sheep and kye! But the tender heart o' leesome loove The gowd and siller canna buy! We may be poor, Robie and I; Light is the burden luve lays on; Content and loove brings peace and joy: What mair hae Queens upon a throne?’ FAIR ELIZA I Turn again, thou fair Eliza! Ae kind blink before we part! Rew on thy despairing lover— Canst thou break his faithfu' heart? Turn again, thou fair Eliza! If to love thy heart denies, For pity hide the cruel sentence Under friendship's kind disguise! II Thee, dear maid, hae I offended? The offence is loving thee. Canst thou wreck his peace for ever, Wha for thine wad gladly die? While the life beats in my bosom, Thou shalt mix in ilka throe. Turn again, thou lovely maiden, Ae sweet smile on me bestow! III Not the bee upon the blossom In the pride o' sinny noon, Not the little sporting fairy All beneath the simmer moon, Not the Poet in the moment Fancy lightens in his e'e, Kens the pleasure, feels the rapture, That thy presence gies to me. YE JACOBITES BY NAME I Ye Jacobites by name, Give an ear, give an ear! Ye Jacobites by name, Give an ear! Ye Jacobites by name, Your fautes I will proclaim, Your doctrines I maun blame— You shall hear! II What is Right, and what is Wrang, By the law, by the law? What is Right, and what is Wrang, By the law? What is Right, and what is Wrang? A short sword and a lang, A weak arm and a strang For to draw! III What makes heroic strife Famed afar, famed afar? What makes heroic strife Famed afar? What makes heroic strife? To whet th'assassin's knife, Or hunt a Parent's life Wi' bluidy war! IV Then let your schemes alone, In the State, in the State! Then let your schemes alone, In the State! Then let your schemes alone, Adore the rising sun, And leave a man undone To his fate! THE POSIE I O, luve will venture in where it daur na weel be seen! O, luve will venture in, where wisdom ance hath been! But I will doun yon river rove amang the wood sae green, And a' to pu' a posie to my ain dear May! II The primrose I will pu', the firstling o' the year, And I will pu' the pink, the emblem o' my dear, For she's the pink o' womankind, and blooms without a peer— And a' to be a posie to my ain dear May! III I'll pu' the budding rose when Phœbus peeps in view, For it's like a baumy kiss o' her sweet, bonie mou. The hyacinth's for constancy wi'its unchanging blue— And a' to be a posie to my ain dear May! IV The lily it is pure, and the lily it is fair, And in her lovely bosom I'll place the lily there. The daisy's for simplicity and unaffected air— And a' to be a posie to my ain dear May! V The hawthorn I will pu', wi' its locks o' siller gray, Where, like an agèd man, it stands at break o' day; But the songster's nest within the bush I winna tak away— And a' to be a posie to my ain dear May! VI The woodbine I will pu' when the e'ening star is near, And the diamond draps o' dew shall be her een sae clear!

VII I'll tie the posie round wi' the silken band o' luve, And I'll place it in her breast, and I'll swear by a' above, That to my latest draught o' life the band shall ne'er remove, And this will be a posie to my ain dear May! THE BANKS O' DOON I Ye banks and braes o' bonie Doon, How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair? How can ye chant, ye little birds, And I sae weary fu' o' care! Thou'll break my heart, thou warbling bird, That wantons thro' the flowering thorn! Thou minds me o' departed joys, Departed never to return. II Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon To see the rose and woodbine twine, And ilka bird sang o' its luve, And fondly sae did I o' mine. Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose, Fu' sweet upon its thorny tree! And my fause luver staw my rose— But ah! he left the thorn wi' me. WILLIE WASTLE I Willie Wastle dwalt on Tweed, The spot they ca'd it Linkumdoddie. Willie was a wabster guid Could stown a clue wi' onie bodie. He had a wife was dour and din, O, Tinkler Maidgie was her mither! Sic a wife as Willie had, I wad na gie a button for her. II She has an e'e (she has but ane), The cat has twa the very colour, Five rusty teeth, forbye a stump, A clapper-tongue wad deave a miller; A whiskin beard about her mou, Her nose and chin they threaten ither: Sic a wife as Willie had, I wad na gie a button for her. III She's bow-hough'd, she's hem-shin'd, Ae limpin leg a hand-breed shorter; She's twisted right, she's twisted left, To balance fair in ilka quarter; She has a hump upon her breast, The twin o' that upon her shouther: Sic a wife as Willie had, I wad na gie a button for her. IV Auld baudrans by the ingle sits, An' wi' her loof her face a-washin; But Willie's wife is nae sae trig, She dights her grunzie wi' a hushion; Her walie nieves like midden-creels, Her face wad fyle the Logan Water: Sic a wife as Willie had, I wad na gie a button for her. LADY MARY ANN I O, Lady Mary Ann looks o'er the Castle wa', She saw three bonie boys playing at the ba', The youngest he was the flower amang them a'— My bonie laddie's young, but he's growin yet! II ‘O father, O father, an ye think it fit, We'll send him a year to the college yet; We'll sew a green ribbon round about his hat, And that will let them ken he's to marry yet!’ III Lady Mary Ann was a flower in the dew, Sweet was its smell and bonie was its hue, And the longer it blossom'd the sweeter it grew, For the lily in the bud will be bonier yet. IV Young Charlie Cochran was the sprout of an aik; Bonie and bloomin and straucht was its make; The sun took delight to shine for its sake, And it will be the brag o' the forest yet. V The simmer is gane when the leaves they were green, And the days are awa that we hae seen; But far better days I trust will come again, For my bonie laddie's young, but he's growin yet SUCH A PARCEL OF ROGUES IN A NATION I Fareweel to a' our Scottish fame, Fareweel our ancient glory! Fareweel ev'n to the Scottish name. Sae famed in martial story! Now Sark rins over Solway sands, An' Tweed rins to the ocean, To mark where England's province stands— Such a parcel of rogues in a nation! II What force or guile could not subdue Thro' many warlike ages Is wrought now by a coward few For hireling traitor's wages. The English steel we could disdain, Secure in valour's station; But English gold has been our bane— Such a parcel of rogues in a nation! III O, would, or I had seen the day That Treason thus could sell us, My auld grey head had lien in clay Wi' Bruce and loyal Wallace! But pith and power, till my last hour I'll mak this declaration:— ‘We're bought and sold for English gold’— Such a parcel of rogues in a nation! KELLYBURN BRAES I There lived a carl in Kellyburn Braes (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), And he had a wife was the plague o' his days (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!).

IV ‘It's neither your stot nor your staig I shall crave (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), ‘But gie me your wife, man, for her I must have’ (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). V ‘O welcome most kindly!’ the blythe carl said (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), ‘But if ye can match her ye're waur than ye're ca'd’ (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). VI The Devil has got the auld wife on his back (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), And like a poor pedlar he's carried his pack (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). VII He's carried her hame to his ain hallan-door (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), Syne bade her gae in for a bitch and a whore (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). VIII Then straight he makes fifty, the pick o' his band (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), Turn out on her guard in the clap o' a hand (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). IX The carlin gaed thro' them like onie wud bear (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!): Whae'er she gat hands on cam ne'er her nae mair (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). X A reekit wee deevil looks over the wa (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!):— ‘O help, maister, help, or she'll ruin us a'!’ (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). XI The Devil he swore by the edge o' his knife (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), He pitied the man that was tied to a wife (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). XII The Devil he swore by the kirk and the bell (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), He was not in wedlock, thank Heav'n, but in Hell (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). XIII Then Satan has travell'd again wi' his pack (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), And to her auld husband he's carried her back (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). XIV ‘I hae been a Devil the feck o' my life (Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme!), But ne'er was in Hell till I met wi' a wife’ (And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime!). THE SLAVE'S LAMENT I It was in sweet Senegal That my foes did me enthral For the lands of Virginia,-ginia, O! Torn from that lovely shore, And must never see it more, And alas! I am weary, weary, O! II All on that charming coast Is no bitter snow and frost, Like the lands of Virginia,-ginia, O! There streams for ever flow, And the flowers for ever blow, And alas! I am weary, weary, O! III The burden I must bear, While the cruel scourge I fear, In the lands of Virginia,-ginia, O! And I think on friends most dear With the bitter, bitter tear, And alas! I am weary, weary, O! THE SONG OF DEATH I Farewell, thou fair day, thou green earth, and ye skies, Now gay with the broad setting sun! Farewell, loves and friendships, ye dear tender ties— Our race of existence is run! Thou grim King of Terrors! thou Life's gloomy foe, Go, frighten the coward and slave! Go, teach them to tremble, fell tyrant, but know, No terrors hast thou to the brave! II Thou strik'st the dull peasant—he sinks in the dark, Nor saves e'en the wreck of a name! Thou strik'st the young hero—a glorious mark, He falls in the blaze of his fame! In the field of proud honour, our swords in our hands, Our king and our country to save, While victory shines on Life's last ebbing sands, O, who would not die with the brave? SWEET AFTON I Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes! Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise! My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream— Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream! II Thou stock dove whose echo resounds thro' the glen, Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den, Thou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear— I charge you, disturb not my slumbering fair! III How lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills, Far mark'd with the courses of clear, winding rills! There daily I wander, as noon rises high, My flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye. IV How pleasant thy banks and green vallies below, Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow There oft, as mild Ev'ning weeps over the lea, The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me. V Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides, And winds by the cot where my Mary resides! How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave, As, gathering sweet flowerets, she stems thy clear wave! VI Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes! Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays! My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream— Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream! BONIE BELL I The smiling Spring comes in rejoicing, And surly Winter grimly flies. Now crystal clear are the falling waters, And bonie blue are the sunny skies. Fresh o'er the mountains breaks forth the morning, The ev'ning gilds the ocean's swell: All creatures joy in the sun's returning, And I rejoice in my bonie Bell. II The flowery Spring leads sunny summer, The yellow Autumn presses near; Then in his turn comes gloomy Winter, Till smiling Spring again appear. Thus seasons dancing, life advancing, Old Time and Nature their changes tell; But never ranging, still unchanging, I adore my bonie Bell. THE GALLANT WEAVER I Where Cart rins rowin to the sea By monie a flower and spreading tree, There lives a lad, the lad for me— He is a gallant weaver! O, I had wooers aught or nine, They gied me rings and ribbons fine, And I was fear'd my heart wad tine, And I gied it to the weaver. II My daddie sign'd my tocher-band To gie the lad that has the land; But to my heart I'll add my hand, And give it to the weaver. While birds rejoice in leafy bowers, While bees delight in opening flowers, While corn grows green in summer showers, I love my gallant weaver. HEY, CA' THRO' Chorus Hey, ca' thro', ca' thro', For we hae mickle ado! Hey, ca' thro', ca' thro', For we hae mickle ado! I Up wi' the carls of Dysart And the lads o' Buckhaven, And the kimmers o' Largo And the lasses o' Leven!

Hey, ca' thro', ca' thro', For we hae mickle ado! O, CAN YE LABOUR LEA Chorus O, can ye labour lea, young man, O, can ye labour lea? Gae back the gate ye came again— Ye'se never scorn me! I I fee'd a man at Martinmas Wi' airle-pennies three; But a' the faut I had to him He couldna labour lea II O, clappin's guid in Febarwar, An' kissin's sweet in May; But what signifies a young man's love, An't dinna last for ay? III O, kissin is the key o' love An' clappin is the lock; An' makin of's the best thing That e'er a young thing got! Chorus O, can ye labour lea, young man, O, can ye labour lea?

He paidles out, and he paidles in, An' he paidles late and early, O! This seven lang years I hae lien by his side, An' he is but a fusionless carlie, O!’ II ‘O, haud your tongue, my feirrie auld wife, O, haud your tongue, now Nansie, O! I've seen the day, and sae hae ye, Ye wad na been sae donsie, O.

A coof cam in wi' routh o' gear, And I hae tint my dearest dear; But Woman is but warld's gear, Sae let the bonie lass gang! II Whae'er ye be that Woman love, To this be never blind: Nae ferlie 'tis, tho' fickle she prove, A woman has't by kind. O Woman lovely, Woman fair, An angel form's faun to thy share, “Twad been o'er meikle to gien thee mair! . . . I mean an angel mind.

THE LOVELY LASS OF INVERNESS I The lovely lass of Inverness, Nae joy nor pleasure can she see; For e'en to morn she cries ‘Alas!’ And ay the saut tear blin's her e'e:— II ‘Drumossie moor, Drumossie day— A waefu' day it was to me! For there I lost my father dear, My father dear and brethren three. III Their winding-sheet the bluidy clay, Their graves are growin green to see, And by them lies the dearest lad That ever blest a woman's e'e. IV Now wae to thee, thou cruel lord, A bluidy man I trow thou be, For monie a heart thou hast made sair That ne'er did wrang to thine or thee!’ A RED, RED ROSE I O, my luve is like a red, red rose, That's newly sprung in June. O, my luve is like the melodie, That's sweetly play'd in tune. II As fair art thou, my bonie lass, So deep in luve am I, And I will luve thee still, my dear, Till a' the seas gang dry.

IV And fare thee weel, my only luve, And fare thee weel a while! And I will come again, my luve, Tho' it were ten thousand mile! AS I STOOD BY YON ROOFLESS TOWER Chorus A lassie all alone was making her moan, Lamenting our lads beyond the sea:— ‘In the bluidy wars they fa', and our honor's gane an' a', And broken-hearted we maun die.’ I As I stood by yon roofless tower, Where the wa'flow'r scents the dewy air, Where the houlet mourns in her ivy bower, And tells the midnight moon her care: II The winds were laid, the air was still, The stars they shot along the sky, The tod was howling on the hill, And the distant-echoing glens reply. III The burn, adown its hazelly path, Was rushing by the ruin'd wa', Hasting to join the sweeping Nith, Whase roarings seem'd to rise and fa'. IV The cauld blae North was streaming forth Her lights, wi' hissing, eerie din: Athort the lift they start and shift, Like Fortune's favours, tint as win. V Now, looking over firth and fauld, Her horn the pale-faced Cynthia rear'd, When lo! in form of minstrel auld A stern and stalwart ghaist appear'd. VI And frae his harp sic strains did flow, Might rous'd the slumbering Dead to hear, But O, it was a tale of woe As ever met a Briton's ear! VII He sang wi' joy his former day, He, weeping, wail'd his latter times: But what he said—it was nae play!— I winna ventur't in my rhymes. Chorus A lassie all alone was making her moan, Lamenting our lads beyond the sea:— ‘In the bluidy wars they fa', and our honor's gane an' a', And broken-hearted we maun die.’ O, AN YE WERE DEAD, GUIDMAN Chorus Sing, round about the fire wi' a rung she ran, An'round about the fire wi' a rung she ran:— ‘Your horns shall tie you to the staw, An' I shall bang your hide, guidman!’ I O, an ye were dead, guidman, A green turf on your head, guidman! I wad bestow my widowhood Upon a rantin Highlandman!

III A sheep-head's in the pot, guidman, A sheep-head's in the pot, guidman: The flesh to him, the broo to me, An' the horns become your brow, guidman! Chorus Sing, round about the fire wi' a rung she ran, An'round about the fire wi' a rung she ran:— ‘Your horns shall tie you to the staw, An' I shall bang your hide, guidman!’ AULD LANG SYNE Chorus For auld lang syne, my dear, For auld lang syne, We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet For auld lang syne! I Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And auld lang syne! II And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp, And surely I'll be mine, And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet For auld lang syne! III We twa hae run about the braes, And pou'd the gowans fine, But we've wander'd monie a weary fit Sin' auld lang syne.

Chorus For auld lang syne, my dear, For auld lang syne, We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet For auld lang syne! LOUIS, WHAT RECK I BY THEE I Louis, what reck I by thee, Or Geordie on his ocean? Dyvor beggar louns to me! I reign in Jeanie's bosom. II Let her crown my love her law, And in her breast enthrone me, Kings and nations—swith awa! Reif randies, I disown ye. HAD I THE WYTE? I Had I the wyte? had I the wyte? Had I the wyte? she bade me! She watch'd me by the hie-gate side, And up the loan she shaw'd me; And when I wadna venture in, A coward loon she ca'd me! Had Kirk and State been in the gate, I'd lighted when she bade me. II Sae craftilie she took me ben And bade me mak nae clatter:— ‘For our ramgunshoch, glum guidman Is o'er ayont the water.’ Whae'er shall say I wanted grace When I did kiss and dawte her, Let him be planted in my place, Syne say I was the fautor! III Could I for shame, could I for shame, Could I for shame refus'd her? And wadna manhood been to blame Had I unkindly used her? He claw'd her wi' the ripplin-kame, And blae and bluidy bruis'd her— When sic a husband was frae hame, What wife but wad excus'd her! IV I dighted ay her een sae blue, An' bann'd the cruel randy, And, weel I wat, her willin mou' Was sweet as sugarcandie. At gloamin-shot, it was, I wot, I lighted—on the Monday, But I cam thro' the Tyseday's dew To wanton Willie's brandy. COMIN THRO' THE RYE Chorus O Jenny's a' weet, poor body, Jenny's seldom dry: She draigl't a' her petticoatie, Comin thro' the rye! I Comin thro' the rye, poor body, Comin thro' the rye, She draigl't a' her petticoatie, Comin thro' the rye! II Gin a body meet a body Comin thro' the rye, Gin a body kiss a body, Need a body cry? III Gin a body meet a body Comin thro' the glen, Gin a body kiss a body, Need the warld ken? Chorus O, Jenny's a' weet, poor body, Jenny's seldom dry: She draigl't a' her petticoatie, Comin thro' the rye! YOUNG JAMIE I Young Jamie, pride of a' the plain, Sae gallant and sae gay a swain, Thro' a' our lasses he did rove, And reign'd resistless King of Love. II But now, wi' sighs and starting tears, He strays amang the woods and breers; Or in the glens and rocky caves His sad complaining dowie raves:— III I, wha sae late did range and rove, And chang'd with every moon my love— I little thought the time was near, Repentance I should buy sae dear. IV ‘The slighted maids my torments see, And laugh at a' the pangs I dree; While she, my cruel, scornful Fair, Forbids me e'er to see her mair.’ OUT OVER THE FORTH I Out over the Forth, I look to the north— But what is the north, and its Highlands to me? The south nor the east gie ease to my breast, The far foreign land or the wide rolling sea! II But I look to the west, when I gae to rest, That happy my dreams and my slumbers may be; For far in the west lives he I loe best, The man that is dear to my babie and me. WANTONNESS FOR EVERMAIR Wantonness for evermair, Wantonness has been my ruin. Yet for a' my dool and care It's wantonness for evermair.

O-hon! for Somebody! O-hey! for Somebody! I wad do—what wad I not?— For the sake o' Somebody! THE CARDIN O'T Chorus The cardin o't, the spinnin o't, The warpin o't, the winnin o't! When ilka ell cost me a groat, The tailor staw the lynin o't. I I coft a stane o' haslock woo, To mak a wab to Johnie o't, For Johnie is my only jo— I lo'e him best of onie yet!

SAE FLAXEN WERE HER RINGLETS I Sae flaxen were her ringlets, Her eyebrows of a darker hue, Bewitchingly o'er-arching Twa laughing een o' bonie blue. Her smiling, sae wyling, Wad make a wretch forget his woe! What pleasure, what treasure, Unto those rosy lips to grow! Such was my Chloris' bonie face, When first that bonie face I saw, And ay my Chloris' dearest charm— She says she lo'es me best of a'! II Like harmony her motion, Her pretty ankle is a spy Betraying fair proportion Wad make a saint forget the sky! Sae warming, sae charming, Her faultless form and gracefu' air, Ilk feature—auld Nature Declar'd that she could dae nae mair! Hers are the willing chains o' love By conquering beauty's sovereign law, And ay my Chloris' dearest charm— She says she lo'es me best of a'. III Let others love the city, And gaudy show at sunny noon! Gie me the lonely valley, The dewy eve, and rising moon, Fair beaming, and streaming Her silver light the boughs amang, While falling, recalling, The amorous thrush concludes his sang! There, dearest Chloris, wilt thou rove By wimpling burn and leafy shaw, And hear my vows o' truth and love, And say thou lo'es me best of a'? THE LASS THAT MADE THE BED I When Januar' wind was blawin cauld, As to the North I took my way, The mirksome night did me enfauld, I knew na where to lodge till day. By my guid luck a maid I met Just in the middle o' my care, And kindly she did me invite To walk into a chamber fair. II I bow'd fu' low unto this maid, And thank'd her for her courtesie; I bow'd fu' low unto this maid, An' bade her mak a bed to me. She made the bed baith large and wide, Wi' twa white hands she spread it down, She put the cup to her rosy lips, And drank:—‘Young man, now sleep ye soun'.’ III She snatch'd the candle in her hand, And frae my chamber went wi' speed, But I call'd her quickly back again To lay some mair below my head: A cod she laid below my head, And servèd me with due respeck, And, to salute her wi' a kiss, I put my arms about her neck. IV ‘Haud aff your hands, young man,’ she said, ‘And dinna sae uncivil be; Gif ye hae onie luve for me, O, wrang na my virginitie!’ Her hair was like the links o' gowd, Her teeth were like the ivorie, Her cheeks like lilies dipt in wine, The lass that made the bed to me! V Her bosom was the driven snaw, Twa drifted heaps sae fair to see; Her limbs the polish'd marble stane, The lass that made the bed to me! I kiss'd her o'er and o'er again, And ay she wist na what to say. I laid her 'tween me an' the wa'— The lassie thocht na lang till day. VI Upon the morrow, when we raise, I thank'd her for her courtesie, But ay she blush'd, and ay she sigh'd, And said:—‘Alas, ye've ruin'd me!’ I clasp'd her waist, and kiss'd her syne, While the tear stood twinklin in her e'e. I said:—‘My lassie, dinna cry, For ye ay shall mak the bed to me.’ VII She took her mither's holland sheets, An' made them a' in sarks to me. Blythe and merry may she be, The lass that made the bed to me! The bonie lass made the bed to me, The braw lass made the bed to me! I'll ne'er forget till the day I die, The lass that made the bed to me. SAE FAR AWA I O, sad and heavy should I part But for her sake sae far awa, Unknowing what my way may thwart— My native land sae far awa. II Thou that of a' things Maker art, That formed this Fair sae far awa, Gie body strength, then I'll ne'er start At this my way sae far awa! III How true is love to pure desert! So mine in her sae far awa, And nocht can heal my bosom's smart, While, O, she is sae far awa! IV Nane other love, nane other dart I feel, but hers sae far awa; But fairer never touched a heart, Than hers, the Fair sae far awa. THE REEL O' STUMPIE I Wap and rowe, wap and rowe, Wap and rowe the feetie o't; I thought I was a maiden fair, Till I heard the greetie o't! II My daddie was a fiddler fine, My minnie she made mantie, O, And I myself a thumpin quine, And danc'd the Reel o' Stumpie, O.

II How blest ye birds that round her sing, And welcome in the blooming year! And doubly welcome be the Spring, The season to my Jeanie dear! III The sun blinks blythe in yon town, Among the broomy braes sae green; But my delight in yon town, And dearest pleasure, is my Jean. IV Without my Love, not a' the charms O' Paradise could yield me joy; But gie me Jeanie in my arms, And welcome Lapland's dreary sky! V My cave wad be a lover's bower, Tho' raging Winter rent the air, And she a lovely little flower, That I wad tent and shelter there. VI O, sweet is she in yon town The sinkin sun's gane down upon! A fairer than's in yon town His setting beam ne'er shone upon. VII If angry Fate be sworn my foe, And suff'ring I am doom'd to bear, I'd careless quit aught else below, But spare, O, spare me Jeanie dear! VIII For, while life's dearest blood is warm, Ae thought frae her shall ne'er depart, And she, as fairest is her form, She has the truest, kindest heart. Chorus O, wat ye wha's in yon town Ye see the e'enin sun upon? The dearest maid's in yon town That e'enin sun is shining on. WHEREFORE SIGHING ART THOU, PHILLIS?

Chorus Mally's meek, Mally's sweet, Mally's modest and discreet, Mally's rare, Mally's fair, Mally's ev'ry way complete. WANDERING WILLIE I Here awa, there awa, wandering Willie, Here awa, there awa, haud awa hame! Come to my bosom, my ae only dearie, And tell me thou bring'st me my Willie the same. II Loud tho' the Winter blew cauld at our parting, 'Twas na the blast brought the tear in my e'e: Welcome now Simmer, and welcome my Willie, The Simmer to Nature, my Willie to me! III Rest, ye wild storms in the cave o' your slumbers— How your wild howling a lover alarms! Wauken, ye breezes, row gently, ye billows, And waft my dear laddie ance mair to my arms. IV But O, if he's faithless, and minds na his Nannie, Flow still between us, thou wide-roaring main! May I never see it, may I never trow it, But, dying, believe that my Willie's my ain! BRAW LADS O' GALLA WATER I Braw, braw lads on Yarrow braes, They rove amang the blooming heather; But Yarrow braes nor Ettrick shaws Can match the lads o' Galla Water. II But there is ane, a secret ane, Aboon them a' I loe him better; And I'll be his, and he'll be mine, The bonie lad o' Galla Water. III Altho' his daddie was nae laird, And tho' I hae nae meikle tocher, Yet, rich in kindest, truest love, We'll tent our flocks by Galla Water. IV It ne'er was wealth, it ne'er was wealth, That coft contentment, peace, and pleasure: The bands and bliss o' mutual love, O, that's the chiefest warld's treasure! AULD ROB MORRIS I There's Auld Rob Morris that wons in yon glen, He's the king o' guid fellows and wale of auld men: He has gowd in his coffers, he has owsen and kine, And ae bonie lassie, his dautie and mine. II She's fresh as the morning the fairest in May, She's sweet as the ev'ning amang the new hay, As blythe and as artless as the lambs on the lea, And dear to my heart as the light to my e'e. III But O, she's an heiress, auld Robin's a laird, And my daddie has nocht but a cot-house and yard! A wooer like me maunna hope to come speed: The wounds I must hide that will soon be my dead. IV The day comes to me, but delight brings me nane; The night comes to me, but my rest it is gane; I wander my lane like a night-troubled ghaist, And I sigh as my heart it wad burst in my breast. V O, had she but been of a lower degree, I then might hae hop'd she wad smil'd upon me! O, how past descriving had then been my bliss, As now my distraction no words can express! OPEN THE DOOR TO ME, O I O, open the door some pity to shew, If love it may na be, O! Tho' thou hast been false, I'll ever prove true— O, open the door to me, O! II Cauld is the blast upon my pale cheek, But caulder thy love for me, O: The frost, that freezes the life at my heart, Is nought to my pains frae thee, O! III The wan moon sets behind the white wave, And Time is setting with me, O: False friends, false love, farewell! for mair I'll ne'er trouble them nor thee, O! IV She has open'd the door, she has open'd it wide, She sees the pale corse on the plain, O, ‘My true love!’ she cried, and sank down by his side— Never to rise again, O! WHEN WILD WAR'S DEADLY BLAST I When wild War's deadly blast was blawn, And gentle Peace returning, Wi' monie a sweet babe fatherless And monie a widow mourning, I left the lines and tented field, Where lang I'd been a lodger, My humble knapsack a' my wealth, A poor and honest sodger. II A leal, light heart was in my breast, My hand unstain'd wi' plunder, And for fair Scotia, hame again, I cheery on did wander: I thought upon the banks o' Coil, I thought upon my Nancy, And ay I mind't the witching smile That caught my youthful fancy. III At length I reach'd the bonie glen, Where early life I sported. I pass'd the mill and trysting thorn, Where Nancy aft I courted. Wha spied I but my ain dear maid, Down by her mother's dwelling, And turn'd me round to hide the flood That in my een was swelling! IV Wi' alter'd voice, quoth I:—‘Sweet lass, Sweet as yon hawthorn's blossom, O, happy, happy may he be, That's dearest to thy bosom! My purse is light, I've far to gang, And fain wad be thy lodger; I've serv'd my king and country lang— Take pity on a sodger.’ V Sae wistfully she gaz'd on me, And lovelier was than ever. Quo' she:—‘A sodger ance I lo'ed, Forget him shall I never. Our humble cot, and hamely fare, Ye freely shall partake it; That gallant badge—the dear cockade— Ye're welcome for the sake o't!’ VI She gaz'd, she redden'd like a rose, Syne, pale like onie lily, She sank within my arms, and cried:— ‘Art thou my ain dear Willie?’ ‘By Him who made yon sun and sky, By whom true love's regarded, I am the man! And thus may still True lovers be rewarded! VII ‘The wars are o'er and I'm come hame, And find thee still true-hearted. Tho' poor in gear, we're rich in love, And mair, we'se ne'er be parted.’ Quo' she :—‘My grandsire left me gowd, A mailen plenish'd fairly! And come, my faithfu' sodger lad, Thou 'rt welcome to it dearly!’ VIII For gold the merchant ploughs the main, The farmer ploughs the manor; But glory is the sodger's prize, The sodger's wealth is honour! The brave poor sodger ne'er despise, Nor count him as a stranger: Remember he's his country's stay In day and hour of danger. DUNCAN GRAY I Duncan Gray cam here to woo (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!) On blythe Yule-Night when we were fou (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!). Maggie coost her head fu' high, Look'd asklent and unco skeigh, Gart poor Duncan stand abeigh— Ha, ha, the wooing o't! II Duncan fleech'd, and Duncan pray'd (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!), Meg was deaf as Ailsa craig (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!). Duncan sigh'd baith out and in, Grat his een baith bleer't an' blin', Spak o' lowpin o'er a linn— Ha, ha, the wooing o't! III Time and Chance are but a tide (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!): Slighted love is sair to bide (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!). ‘Shall I like a fool,’ quoth he, ‘For a haughty hizzie die? She may gae to—France for me!’— Ha, ha, the wooing o't! IV How it comes, let doctors tell (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!): Meg grew sick, as he grew hale (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!). Something in her bosom wrings, For relief a sigh she brings, And O! her een they spak sic things!— Ha, ha, the wooing o't! V Duncan was a lad o' grace (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!), Maggie's was a piteous case (Ha, ha, the wooing o't!): Duncan could na be her death, Swelling pity smoor'd his wrath; Now they're crouse and canty baith— Ha, ha, the wooing o't! DELUDED SWAIN, THE PLEASURE I Deluded swain, the pleasure The fickle Fair can give thee Is but a fairy treasure— Thy hopes will soon deceive thee: The billows on the ocean, The breezes idly roaming, The cloud's uncertain motion, They are but types of Woman! II O, art thou not ashamèd To doat upon a feature? If Man thou would'st be namèd, Despise the silly creature! Go, find an honest fellow, Good claret set before thee, Hold on till thou art mellow, And then to bed in glory! HERE IS THE GLEN I Here is the glen, and here the bower All underneath the birchen shade, The village-bell has toll'd the hour— O, what can stay my lovely maid? 'Tis not Maria's whispering call— 'Tis but the balmy-breathing gale, Mixed with some warbler's dying fall The dewy star of eve to hail! II It is Maria's voice I hear!— So calls the woodlark in the grove His little faithful mate to cheer: At once 'tis music and 'tis love! And art thou come? And art thou true? O, welcome, dear, to love and me, And let us all our vows renew Along the flowery banks of Cree! LET NOT WOMEN E'ER COMPLAIN I Let not women e'er complain Of inconstancy in love! Let not women e'er complain Fickle man is apt to rove! Look abroad thro' Nature's range, Nature's mighty law is change: Ladies, would it not be strange Man should then a monster prove? II Mark the winds, and mark the skies, Ocean's ebb and ocean's flow. Sun and moon but set to rise. Round and round the seasons go. Why then, ask of silly man To oppose great Nature's plan? We'll be constant, while we can— You can be no more, you know! LORD GREGORY I O, mirk, mirk is this midnight hour, And loud the tempest's roar! A waefu' wanderer seeks thy tower— Lord Gregory, ope thy door. II An exile frae her father's ha', And a' for sake o' thee, At least some pity on me shaw, If love it may na be. III Lord Gregory mind'st thou not the grove By bonie Irwine side, Where first I own'd that virgin love I lang, lang had denied? IV How aften didst thou pledge and vow, Thou wad for ay be mine! And my fond heart, itsel' sae true, It ne'er mistrusted thine. V Hard is thy heart, Lord Gregory, And flinty is thy breast: Thou bolt of Heaven that flashest by, O, wilt thou bring me rest! VI Ye mustering thunders from above, Your willing victim see, But spare and pardon my fause love His wrangs to Heaven and me! O POORTITH CAULD Chorus O, why should Fate sic pleasure have Life's dearest bands untwining? Or why sae sweet a flower as love Depend on Fortune's shining? I O Poortith cauld and restless Love, Ye wrack my peace between ye! Yet poortith a' I could forgive, An 'twere na for my Jeanie. II The warld's wealth when I think on, Its pride and a' the lave o't— My curse on silly coward man, That he should be the slave o't! III Her een sae bonie blue betray How she repays my passion; But prudence is her o'erword ay: She talks o' rank and fashion. IV O, wha can prudence think upon, And sic a lassie by him? O, wha can prudence think upon, And sae in love as I am? V How blest the wild-wood Indian's fate! He woos his artless dearie— The silly bogles, Wealth and State, Can never make him eerie. Chorus O, why should Fate sic pleasure have, Life's dearest bands untwining? Or why sae sweet a flower as love Depend on Fortune's shining? O, STAY, SWEET WARBLING WOOD-LARK I O, stay, sweet warbling wood-lark, stay, Nor quit for me the trembling spray! A hapless lover courts thy lay, Thy soothing, fond complaining. Again, again that tender part, That I may catch thy melting art! For surely that wad touch her heart, Wha kills me wi' disdaining. II Say, was thy little mate unkind, And heard thee as the careless wind? O, nocht but love and sorrow join'd Sic notes o' woe could wauken! Thou tells o' never-ending care, O' speechless grief and dark despair— For pity's sake, sweet bird, nae mair, Or my poor heart is broken! SAW YE BONIE LESLEY I O, saw ye bonie Lesley, As she gaed o'er the Border? She's gane, like Alexander, To spread her conquests farther! II To see her is to love her, And love but her for ever; For Nature made her what she is, And never made anither! III Thou art a queen, fair Lesley— Thy subjects, we before thee! Thou art divine, fair Lesley— The hearts o' men adore thee. IV The Deil he could na skaith thee, Or aught that wad belang thee: He'd look into thy bonie face, And say:—‘I canna wrang thee!’ V The Powers aboon will tent thee, Misfortune sha'na steer thee: Thou 'rt like themsel' sae lovely, That ill they 'll ne'er let near thee. VI Return again, fair Lesley, Return to Caledonie! That we may brag we hae a lass There's nane again sae bonie. SWEET FA'S THE EVE I Sweet fa's the eve on Craigieburn, And blythe awakes the morrow, But a' the pride o' Spring's return Can yield me nocht but sorrow. II I see the flowers and spreading trees, I hear the wild birds singing; But what a weary wight can please, And Care his bosom is wringing? III Fain, fain would I my griefs impart, Yet dare na for your anger; But secret love will break my heart, If I conceal it langer. IV If thou refuse to pity me, If thou shalt love another, When yon green leaves fade frae the tree, Around my grave they'll wither. YOUNG JESSIE I True hearted was he, the sad swain o' the Yarrow, And fair are the maids on the banks of the Ayr; But by the sweet side o' the Nith's winding river Are lovers as faithful and maidens as fair: To equal young Jessie you seek Scotia all over— To equal young Jessie you seek it in vain! Grace, beauty, and elegance fetter her lover, And maidenly modesty fixes the chain. II Fresh is the rose in the gay, dewy morning, And sweet is the lily at evening close; But in the fair presence o' lovely young Jessie Unseen is the lily, unheeded the rose. Love sits in her smile, a wizard ensnaring; Enthron'd in her een he delivers his law; And still to her charms she alone is a stranger: Her modest demeanour's the jewel of a'. ADOWN WINDING NITH Chorus Awa wi' your belles and your beauties— They never wi' her can compare! Whaever hae met wi' my Phillis Has met wi' the Queen o' the Fair! I Adown winding Nith I did wander To mark the sweet flowers as they spring. Adown winding Nith I did wander Of Phillis to muse and to sing. II The Daisy amus'd my fond fancy, So artless, so simple, so wild: ‘Thou emblem,’ said I, ‘o' my Phillis’— For she is Simplicity's child. III The rose-bud's the blush o' my charmer, Her sweet balmy lip when 'tis prest. How fair and how pure is the lily! But fairer and purer her breast. IV Yon knot of gay flowers in the arbour, They ne'er wi' my Phillis can vie: Her breath is the breath of the woodbine, Its dew-drop o' diamond her eye. V Her voice is the song o' the morning, That wakes thro' the green-spreading grove, When Phebus peeps over the mountains On music, and pleasure, and love. VI But Beauty, how frail and how fleeting! The bloom of a fine summer's day! While Worth in the mind o' my Phillis Will flourish without a decay. Chorus Awa wi' your belles and your beauties— They never wi' her can compare! Whaever hae met wi' my Phillis Has met wi' the Queen o' the Fair! A LASS WI' A TOCHER Chorus Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher, Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher, Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher, The nice yellow guineas for me! I Awa wi' your witchcraft o' Beauty's alarms, The slender bit beauty you grasp in your arms! O, gie me the lass that has acres o' charms! O, gie me the lass wi' the weel-stockit farms! II Your Beauty's a flower in the morning that blows, And withers the faster the faster it grows; But the rapturous charm o' the bonie green knowes, Ilk spring they're new deckit wi' bonie white yowes! III And e'en when this Beauty your bosom has blest, The brightest o' Beauty may cloy when possess'd; But the sweet, yellow darlings wi' Geordie impress'd, The langer ye hae them, the mair they're carest! Chorus Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher, Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher, Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher, The nice yellow guineas for me! BLYTHE HAE I BEEN ON YON HILL I Blythe hae I been on yon hill As the lambs before me, Careless ilka thought, and free As the breeze flew o'er me. Now nae langer sport and play, Mirth or sang can please me: Lesley is sae fair and coy, Care and anguish seize me. II Heavy, heavy is the task, Hopeless love declaring! Trembling, I dow nocht but glow'r, Sighing, dumb despairing! If she winna ease the thraws In my bosom swelling, Underneath the grass-green sod Soon maun be my dwelling. BY ALLAN STREAM I By Allan stream I chanc'd to rove, While Phebus sank beyond Benledi; The winds were whispering thro' the grove, The yellow corn was waving ready; I listen'd to a lover's sang, An' thought on youthfu' pleasures monie, And ay the wild-wood echoes rang:— ‘O, my love Annie's very bonie! II ‘O, happy be the woodbine bower, Nae nightly bogle make it eerie! Nor ever sorrow stain the hour, The place and time I met my dearie! Her head upon my throbbing breast, She, sinking, said:—“I'm thine for ever!” While monie a kiss the seal imprest— The sacred vow we ne'er should sever.’ III The haunt o' Spring's the primrose-brae. The Summer joys the flocks to follow. How cheery thro' her short'ning day Is Autumn in her weeds o' yellow! But can they melt the glowing heart, Or chain the soul in speechless pleasure, Or thro' each nerve the rapture dart, Like meeting her, our bosom's treasure? CANST THOU LEAVE ME Chorus Canst thou leave me thus, my Katie! Canst thou leave me thus, my Katie! Well thou know'st my aching heart, And canst thou leave me thus for pity? I Is this thy plighted, fond regard: Thus cruelly to part, my Katie? Is this thy faithful swain's reward: An aching broken heart, my Katie? II Farewell! And ne'er such sorrows tear That fickle heart of thine, my Katie! Thou may'st find those will love thee dear, But not a love like mine, my Katie. Chorus Canst thou leave me thus, my Katie! Canst thou leave me thus, my Katie! Well thou know'st my aching heart, And canst thou leave me thus for pity? COME, LET ME TAKE THEE I Come, let me take thee to my breast, And pledge we ne'er shall sunder, And I shall spurn as vilest dust The world's wealth and grandeur! And do I hear my Jeanie own That equal transports move her? I ask for dearest life alone, That I may live to love her. II Thus in my arms, wi' a' her charms, I clasp my countless treasure, I'll seek nae mair o' Heav'n to share Than sic a moment's pleasure! And by thy een sae bonie blue I swear I'm thine for ever, And on thy lips I seal my vow, And break it shall I never! CONTENTED WI' LITTLE I Contented wi' little and cantie wi' mair, Whene'er I forgather wi' Sorrow and Care, I gie them a skelp, as they're creepin alang, Wi' a cog o' guid swats and an auld Scottish sang. II I whyles claw the elbow o' troublesome Thought; But Man is a soger, and Life is a faught. My mirth and guid humour are coin in my pouch, And my Freedom's my lairdship nae monarch daur touch. III A towmond o' trouble, should that be my fa', A night o' guid fellowship sowthers it a': When at the blythe end o' our journey at last, Wha the Deil ever thinks o' the road he has past? IV Blind Chance, let her snapper and stoyte on her way, Be't to me, be't frae me, e'en let the jade gae! Come Ease or come Travail, come Pleasure or Pain, My warst word is:—‘Welcome, and welcome again!’ FAREWELL, THOU STREAM I Farewell, thou stream that winding flows Around Eliza's dwelling! O Mem'ry, spare the cruel throes Within my bosom swelling: Condemn'd to drag a hopeless chain And yet in secret languish, To feel a fire in every vein Nor dare disclose my anguish! II Love's veriest wretch, unseen, unknown, I fain my griefs would cover: The bursting sigh, th'unweeting groan Betray the hapless lover. I know thou doom'st me to despair, Nor wilt, nor canst relieve me; But, O Eliza, hear one prayer— For pity's sake forgive me! III The music of thy voice I heard, Nor wist while it enslav'd me! I saw thine eyes, yet nothing fear'd, Till fears no more had sav'd me! Th'unwary sailor thus, aghast The wheeling torrent viewing, 'Mid circling horrors sinks at last In overwhelming ruin. HAD I A CAVE I Had I a cave On some wild distant shore, Where the winds howl To the wave's dashing roar, There would I weep my woes, There seek my lost repose, Till grief my eyes should close, Ne'er to wake more! II Falsest of womankind, Can'st thou declare All thy fond, plighted vows Fleeting as air? To thy new lover hie, Laugh o'er thy perjury, Then in thy bosom try What peace is there! HERE'S A HEALTH Chorus Here's a health to ane I loe dear! Here's a health to ane I loe dear! Thou art sweet as the smile when fond lovers meet, And soft as their parting tear, Jessy— And soft as their parting tear! I Altho' thou maun never be mine, Altho' even hope is denied, 'Tis sweeter for thee despairing Than ought in the world beside, Jessy— Than ought in the world beside! II I mourn thro' the gay, gaudy day, As hopeless I muse on thy charms; But welcome the dream o' sweet slumber! For then I am lockt in thine arms, Jessy— For then I am lockt in thine arms! Chorus Here's a health to ane I loe dear! Here's a health to ane I loe dear! Thou art sweet as the smile when fond lovers meet, And soft as their parting tear, Jessy— And soft as their parting tear! HOW CRUEL ARE THE PARENTS I How cruel are the parents Who riches only prize, And to the wealthy booby Poor Woman sacrifice! Meanwhile the hapless daughter Has but a choice of strife: To shun a tyrant father's hate Become a wretched wife! II The ravening hawk pursuing, The trembling dove thus flies: To shun impending ruin Awhile her pinion tries, Till, of escape despairing, No shelter or retreat, She trusts the ruthless falconer, And drops beneath his feet. HUSBAND, HUSBAND, CEASE YOUR STRIFE I Husband, husband, cease your strife, Nor longer idly rave, sir! Tho' I am your wedded wife, Yet I am not your slave, sir. ‘One of two must still obey, Nancy, Nancy! Is it Man or Woman, say, My spouse Nancy?’ II ‘If 'tis still the lordly word, Service and obedience, I'll desert my sov'reign lord, And so goodbye, allegiance!’ ‘Sad will I be so bereft, Nancy, Nancy! Yet I'll try to make a shift, My spouse Nancy!’ III ‘My poor heart, then break it must, My last hour I am near it: When you lay me in the dust, Think, how will you bear it?’ ‘I will hope and trust in Heaven, Nancy, Nancy! Strength to bear it will be given, My spouse Nancy.’ IV ‘Well, sir, from the silent dead, Still I'll try to daunt you: Ever round your midnight bed Horrid sprites shall haunt you!’ ‘I'll wed another like my dear, Nancy, Nancy! Then all Hell will fly for fear, My spouse Nancy!’ IT WAS THE CHARMING MONTH Chorus Lovely was she by the dawn, Youthful Chloe, charming Chloe, Tripping o'er the pearly lawn, The youthful, charming Chloe! I It was the charming month of May, When all the flow'rs were fresh and gay, One morning, by the break of day, The youthful, charming Chloe, From peaceful slumber she arose, Girt on her mantle and her hose, And o'er the flow'ry mead she goes— The youthful, charming Chloe! II The feather'd people you might see Perch'd all around on every tree! With notes of sweetest melody They hail the charming Chloe, Till, painting gay the eastern skies, The glorious sun began to rise, Outrival'd by the radiant eyes Of youthful, charming Chloe. Chorus Lovely was she by the dawn, Youthful Chloe, charming Chloe, Tripping o'er the pearly lawn, The youthful, charming Chloe! LAST MAY A BRAW WOOER I Last May a braw wooer cam down the lang glen, And sair wi' his love he did deave me. I said there was naething I hated like men: The deuce gae wi'm to believe me, believe me— The deuce gae wi'm to believe me! II He spak o' the darts in my bonie black een, And vow'd for my love he was diein. I said, he might die when he liket for Jean: The Lord forgie me for liein, for liein— The Lord forgie me for liein! III A weel-stocket mailen, himsel for the laird, And marriage aff-hand were his proffers: I never loot on that I kenn'd it, or car'd, But thought I might hae waur offers, waur offers— But thought I might hae waur offers. IV But what wad ye think? In a fortnight or less (The Deil tak his taste to gae near her!) He up the Gate-Slack to my black cousin, Bess! Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her, could bear her— Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her. V But a' the niest week, as I petted wi' care, I gaed to the tryste o' Dalgarnock, And wha but my fine fickle lover was there? I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock, a warlock— I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock. VI But owre my left shouther I gae him a blink, Lest neebours might say I was saucy. My wooer he caper'd as he'd been in drink, And vow'd I was his dear lassie, dear lassie— And vow'd I was his dear lassie! VII I spier'd for my cousin fu' couthy and sweet: Gin she had recover'd her hearin? And how her new shoon fit her auld, shachl'd feet? But heavens! how he fell a swearin, a swearin— But heavens! how he fell a swearin! VIII He beggèd, for gudesake, I wad be his wife, Or else I wad kill him wi' sorrow; So e'en to preserve the poor body in life, I think I maun wed him to-morrow, to-morrow— I think I maun wed him to-morrow! MY NANIE'S AWA I Now in her green mantle blythe Nature arrays, And listens the lambkins that bleat o'er the braes, While birds warble welcomes in ilka green shaw, But to me it's delightless—my Nanie's awa. II The snawdrap and primrose our woodlands adorn, And violets bathe in the weet o' the morn. They pain my sad bosom, sae sweetly they blaw: They mind me o' Nanie—and Nanie's awa! III Thou lav'rock, that springs frae the dews of the lawn The shepherd to warn o' the grey-breaking dawn, And thou mellow mavis, that hails the night-fa, Give over for pity—my Nanie's awa. IV Come Autumn, sae pensive in yellow and grey, And soothe me wi' tidings o' Nature's decay! The dark, dreary Winter and wild-driving snaw Alane can delight me—now Nanie's awa. NOW ROSY MAY Chorus Meet me on the Warlock Knowe, Dainty Davie, Dainty Davie! There I'll spend the day wi' you, My ain dear Dainty Davie. I Now rosy May comes in wi' flowers To deck her gay, green-spreading bowers; And now comes in the happy hours To wander wi' my Davie. II The crystal waters round us fa', The merry birds are lovers a', The scented breezes round us blaw, A wandering wi' my Davie. III When purple morning starts the hare To steal upon her early fare, Then thro' the dews I will repair To meet my faithfu' Davie. IV When day, expiring in the west, The curtain draws o' Nature's rest, I flee to his arms I loe the best: And that's my ain dear Davie! Chorus Meet me on the Warlock Knowe, Dainty Davie, Dainty Davie! There I'll spend the day wi' you, My ain dear Dainty Davie. NOW SPRING HAS CLAD I Now spring has clad the grove in green, And strew'd the lea wi' flowers; The furrow'd, waving corn is seen Rejoice in fostering showers; While ilka thing in nature join Their sorrows to forego, O, why thus all alone are mine The weary steps o' woe! II The trout within yon wimpling burn Glides swift, a silver dart, And, safe beneath the shady thorn, Defies the angler's art: My life was ance that careless stream, That wanton trout was I, But Love wi' unrelenting beam Has scorch'd my fountains dry. III The little floweret's peaceful lot, In yonder cliff that grows, Which, save the linnet's flight, I wot, Nae ruder visit knows, Was mine, till Love has o'er me past, And blighted a' my bloom; And now beneath the withering blast My youth and joy consume. IV The waken'd lav'rock warbling springs, And climbs the early sky, Winnowing blythe his dewy wings In Morning's rosy eye: As little reck't I Sorrow's power, Until the flowery snare O' witching Love in luckless hour Made me the thrall o' care! V O, had my fate been Greenland snows Or Afric's burning zone, Wi' Man and Nature leagu'd my foes, So Peggy ne'er I'd known! The wretch, whose doom is ‘hope nae mair,’ What tongue his woes can tell, Within whose bosom, save Despair, Nae kinder spirits dwell! O, THIS IS NO MY AIN LASSIE Chorus O, this is no my ain lassie, Fair tho' the lassie be: Weel ken I my ain lassie— Kind love is in her e'e. I I see a form, I see a face, Ye weel may wi' the fairest place: It wants to me the witching grace, The kind love that's in her e'e. II She's bonie, blooming, straight, and tall, And lang has had my heart in thrall; And ay it charms my very saul, The kind love that's in the e'e. III A thief sae pawkie is my Jean, To steal a blink by a' unseen! But gleg as light are lover's een, When kind love is in the e'e. IV It may escape the courtly sparks, It may escape the learned clerks; But well the watching lover marks The kind love that's in her e'e. Chorus O, this is no my ain lassie, Fair tho' the lassie be: Weel ken I my ain lassie— Kind love is in her e'e. O, WAT YE WHA THAT LO'ES ME Chorus O, that's the lassie o' my heart, My lassie ever dearer! O, that's the queen o' womankind, And ne'er a ane to peer her! I O, wat ye wha that lo'es me, And has my heart a keeping? O, sweet is she that lo'es me As dews o' summer weeping, In tears the rosebuds steeping! II If thou shalt meet a lassie In grace and beauty charming, That e'en thy chosen lassie, Erewhile thy breast sae warming, Had ne'er sic powers alarming:— III If thou hadst heard her talking (And thy attention's plighted), That ilka body talking But her by thee is slighted, And thou art all-delighted:— IV If thou hast met this fair one, When frae her thou hast parted, If every other fair one But her thou hast deserted, And thou art broken-hearted:— Chorus O, that's the lassie o' my heart, My lassie ever dearer! O, that's the queen o' womankind, And ne'er a ane to peer her! SCOTS, WHA HAE I Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled, Scots, wham Bruce has aften led, Welcome to your gory bed Or to victorie! II Now's the day, and now's the hour: See the front o' battle lour, See approach proud Edward's power— Chains and slaverie! III Wha will be a traitor knave? Wha can fill a coward's grave? Wha sae base as be a slave?— Let him turn, and flee! IV Wha for Scotland's King and Law Freedom's sword will strongly draw, Freeman stand or freeman fa', Let him follow me! V By Oppression's woes and pains, By your sons in servile chains, We will drain our dearest veins But they shall be free! VI Lay the proud usurpers low! Tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty's in every blow! Let us do, or die! THEIR GROVES O' SWEET MYRTLE I Their groves o' sweet myrtle let foreign lands reckon, Where bright-beaming summers exalt the perfume! Far dearer to me yon lone glen o' green breckan, Wi' the burn stealing under the lang, yellow broom; Far dearer to me are yon humble broom bowers, Where the blue-bell and gowan lurk lowly, unseen; For there, lightly tripping among the wild flowers, A-list'ning the linnet, aft wanders my Jean. II Tho' rich is the breeze in their gay, sunny vallies, And cauld Caledonia's blast on the wave, Their sweet-scented woodlands that skirt the proud palace, What are they?—The haunt of the tyrant and slave! The slave's spicy forests and gold-bubbling fountains The brave Caledonian views wi' disdain: He wanders as free as the winds of his mountains, Save Love's willing fetters—the chains o' his Jean. THINE AM I I Thine am I, my faithful Fair, Thine my lovely Nancy! Ev'ry pulse along my veins, Ev'ry roving fancy! To thy bosom lay my heart There to throb and languish. Tho' despair had wrung its core, That would heal its anguish. II Take away those rosy lips Rich with balmy treasure! Turn away thine eyes of love, Lest I die with pleasure! What is life when wanting love? Night without a morning! Love the cloudless summer's sun, Nature gay adorning. THOU HAST LEFT ME EVER, JAMIE I Thou hast left me ever, Jamie, Thou hast left me ever! Thou hast left me ever, Jamie, Thou hast left me ever! Aften hast thou vow'd that Death Only should us sever; Now thou'st left thy lass for ay— I maun see thee never, Jamie, I'll see thee never! II Thou hast me forsaken, Jamie, Thou hast me forsaken! Thou hast me forsaken, Jamie, Thou hast me forsaken! Thou canst love another jo, While my heart is breaking Soon my weary een I'll close, Never mair to waken, Jamie, Never mair to waken! HIGHLAND MARY I Ye banks and braes and streams around The castle o' Montgomery, Green be your woods, and fair your flowers, Your waters never drumlie! There Summer first unfald her robes, And there the langest tarry! For there I took the last fareweel O' my sweet Highland Mary! II How sweetly bloom'd the gay, green birk, How rich the hawthorn's blossom, As underneath their fragrant shade I clasp'd her to my bosom! The golden hours on angel wings Flew o'er me and my dearie: For dear to me as light and life Was my sweet Highland Mary. III Wi' monie a vow and lock'd embrace Our parting was fu' tender; And, pledging aft to meet again, We tore oursels asunder. But O, fell Death's untimely frost, That nipt my flower sae early! Now green's the sod, and cauld's the clay, That wraps my Highland Mary! IV O, pale, pale now, those rosy lips I aft hae kiss'd sae fondly; And clos'd for ay, the sparkling glance That dwalt on me sae kindly; And mouldering now in silent dust That heart that lo'ed me dearly! But still within my bosom's core Shall live my Highland Mary. MY CHLORIS, MARK I My Chloris, mark how green the groves, The primrose banks how fair! The balmy gales awake the flowers, And wave thy flaxen hair. II The lav'rock shuns the palace gay, And o'er the cottage sings: For Nature smiles as sweet, I ween, To shepherds as to kings. III Let minstrels sweep the skilfu' string In lordly, lighted ha': The shepherd stops his simple reed, Blythe in the birken shaw. IV The princely revel may survey Our rustic dance wi' scorn; But are their hearts as light as ours Beneath the milk-white thorn? V The shepherd in the flowery glen In shepherd's phrase will woo: The courtier tells a finer tale— But is his heart as true? VI Here wild-wood flowers I've pu'd, to deck That spotless breast o' thine: The courtier's gems may witness love— But 'tis na love like mine! FAIREST MAID ON DEVON BANKS Chorus Fairest maid on Devon banks, Crystal Devon, winding Devon, Wilt thou lay that frown aside, And smile as thou wert wont to do? I Full well thou know'st I love thee dear— Couldst thou to malice lend an ear! O, did not Love exclaim:—‘Forbear, Nor use a faithful lover so!’ II Then come, thou fairest of the fair, Those wonted smiles, O, let me share, And by thy beauteous self I swear No love but thine my heart shall know! Chorus Fairest maid on Devon banks, Crystal Devon, winding Devon, Wilt thou lay that frown aside, And smile as thou wert wont to do? LASSIE WI' THE LINT-WHITE LOCKS Chorus Lassie wi' the lint-white locks, Bonie lassie, artless lassie, Wilt thou wi' me tent the flocks— Wilt thou be my dearie, O? I Now Nature cleeds the flowery lea, And a' is young and sweet like thee, O, wilt thou share its joys wi' me, And say thou'lt be my dearie, O? II The primrose bank, the wimpling burn, The cuckoo on the milk-white thorn, The wanton lambs at early morn Shall welcome thee, my dearie, O. III And when the welcome simmer shower Has cheer'd ilk drooping little flower, We'll to the breathing woodbine-bower At sultry noon, my dearie, O. IV When Cynthia lights wi' silver ray The weary shearer's hameward way, Thro' yellow waving fields we'll stray, And talk o' love, my dearie, O. V And when the howling wintry blast Disturbs my lassie's midnight rest, Enclaspèd to my faithfu' breast, I'll comfort thee, my dearie, O. Chorus Lassie wi' the lint-white locks, Bonie lassie, artless lassie, Wilt thou wi' me tent the flocks— Wilt thou be my dearie, O? LONG, LONG THE NIGHT Chorus Long, long the night, Heavy comes the morrow, While my soul's delight Is on her bed of sorrow. I Can I cease to care, Can I cease to languish, While my darling fair Is on the couch of anguish! II Ev'ry hope is fled, Ev'ry fear is terror: Slumber ev'n I dread, Ev'ry dream is horror. III Hear me, Powers Divine: O, in pity, hear me! Take aught else mine, But my Chloris spare me! Chorus Long, long the night, Heavy comes the morrow, While my soul's delight Is on her bed of sorrow. LOGAN WATER I O Logan, sweetly didst thou glide That day I was my Willie's bride, And years sin syne hae o'er us run Like Logan to the simmer sun. But now thy flowery banks appear Like drumlie winter, dark and drear, While my dear lad maun face his faes Far, far frae me and Logan braes. II Again the merry month of May Has made our hills and vallies gay; The birds rejoice in leafy bowers, The bees hum round the breathing flowers; Blythe Morning lifts his rosy eye, And Evening's tears are tears o' joy: My soul delightless a' surveys, While Willie's far frae Logan braes. III Within yon milk-white hawthorn bush, Amang her nestlings sits the thrush: Her faithfu' mate will share her toil, Or wi' his song her cares beguile. But I wi' my sweet nurslings here, Nae mate to help, nae mate to cheer, Pass widow'd nights and joyless days, While Willie's far frae Logan braes. IV O, wae upon you, Men o' State, That brethren rouse in deadly hate! As ye make monie a fond heart mourn, Sae may it on your heads return! Ye mindna 'mid your cruel joys The widow's tears, the orphan's cries; But soon may peace bring happy days, And Willie hame to Logan braes! YON ROSY BRIER I O, bonie was yon rosy brier That blooms sae far frae haunt o' man, And bonie she—and ah, how dear!— It shaded frae the e'enin sun! II Yon rosebuds in the morning dew, How pure among the leaves sae green! But purer was the lover's vow They witnessed in their shade yestreen. III All in its rude and prickly bower, That crimson rose how sweet and fair! But love is far a sweeter flower Amid life's thorny path o' care. IV The pathless wild and wimpling burn, Wi' Chloris in my arms, be mine, And I the warld nor wish nor scorn— Its joys and griefs alike resign! WHERE ARE THE JOYS I Where are the joys I hae met in the morning, That danc'd to the lark's early sang? Where is the peace that awaited my wand'ring At e'ening the wild-woods amang? II Nae mair a-winding the course o' yon river And marking sweet flowerets sae fair, Nae mair I trace the light footsteps o' Pleasure, But Sorrow and sad-sighing Care. III Is it that Summer's forsaken our vallies, And grim, surly Winter is near? No, no, the bees humming round the gay roses Proclaim it the pride o' the year. IV Fain wad I hide what I fear to discover, Yet lang, lang, too well hae I known: A' that has causèd the wreck in my bosom Is Jenny, fair Jenny alone! V Time cannot aid me, my griefs are immortal, Not Hope dare a comfort bestow. Come then, enamor'd and fond of my anguish, Enjoyment I'll seek in my woe! BEHOLD THE HOUR I Behold the hour, the boat arrive! Thou goest, the darling of my heart! Sever'd from thee, can I survive? But Fate has will'd and we must part. I'll often greet the surging swell, Yon distant isle will often hail:— ‘E'en here I took the last farewell; There, latest mark'd her vanish'd sail.’ II Along the solitary shore, While flitting sea-fowl round me cry, Across the rolling, dashing roar, I'll westward turn my wistful eye:— ‘Happy, thou Indian grove,’ I'll say, ‘Where now my Nancy's path may be! While thro' thy sweets she loves to stray, O, tell me, does she muse on me?’ FORLORN MY LOVE Chorus O, wert thou, love, but near me, But near, near, near me, How kindly thou would cheer me, And mingle sighs with mine, love! I Forlorn my love, no comfort near, Far, far from thee I wander here; Far, far from thee, the fate severe, At which I most repine, love. II Around me scowls a wintry sky, Blasting each bud of hope and joy, And shelter, shade, nor home have I Save in these arms of thine, love. III Cold, alter'd friendship's cruel part, To poison Fortune's ruthless dart! Let me not break thy faithful heart, And say that fate is mine, love! IV But, dreary tho' the moments fleet, O, let me think we yet shall meet! That only ray of solace sweet Can on thy Chloris shine, love! Chorus O, wert thou, love, but near me, But near, near, near me, How kindly thou would cheer me, And mingle sighs with mine, love! CA' THE YOWES TO THE KNOWES SECOND SET Chorus Ca' the yowes to the knowes, Ca' them where the heather grows, Ca' them where the burnie rowes. My bonie dearie. I Hark, the mavis' e'ening sang Sounding Clouden's woods amang Then a-faulding let us gang, My bonie dearie. II We'll gae down by Clouden side, Thro' the hazels, spreading wide O'er the waves that sweetly glide To the moon sae clearly. III Yonder Clouden's silent towers Where, at moonshine's midnight hours, O'er the dewy bending flowers Fairies dance sae cheery. IV Ghaist nor bogle shalt thou fear— Thou'rt to Love and Heav'n sae dear Nocht of ill may come thee near, My bonie dearie Chorus Ca' the yowes to the knowes, Ca' them where the heather grows, Ca' them where the burnie rowes, My bonie dearie. HOW CAN MY POOR HEART I How can my poor heart be glad When absent from my sailor lad? How can I the thought forego— He's on the seas to meet the foe? Let me wander, let me rove, Still my heart is with my love. Nightly dreams and thoughts by day Are with him that's far away. On the seas and far away, On stormy seas and far away— Nightly dreams and thoughts by day, Are ay with him that's far away. II When in summer noon I faint, As weary flocks around me pant, Haply in this scorching sun My sailor's thund'ring at his gun. Bullets, spare my only joy! Bullets, spare my darling boy! Fate, do with me what you may, Spare but him that's far away! On the seas and far away, On stormy seas and far away— Fate, do with me what you may, Spare but him that's far away! III At the starless, midnight hour When Winter rules with boundless power, As the storms the forests tear, And thunders rend the howling air, Listening to the doubling roar Surging on the rocky shore, All I can—I weep and pray For his weal that's far away. On the seas and far away, On stormy seas and far away, All I can—I weep and pray For his weal that's far away. IV Peace, thy olive wand extend And bid wild War his ravage end; Man with brother man to meet, And as brother kindly greet! Then may Heaven with prosperous gales Fill my sailor's welcome sails, To my arms their charge convey, My dear lad that's far away! On the seas and far away, On stormy seas and far away, To my arms their charge convey, My dear lad that's far away! IS THERE FOR HONEST POVERTY I Is there for honest poverty That hings his head, an' a' that? The coward slave, we pass him by— We dare be poor for a' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Our toils obscure, an' a' that, The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The man's the gowd for a' that. II What though on hamely fare we dine, Wear hoddin grey, an' a' that? Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine— A man's a man for a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, Their tinsel show, an' a' that, The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, Is king o' men for a' that. III Ye see yon birkie ca'd ‘a lord,’ Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that? Tho' hundreds worship at his word, He's but a cuif for a' that. For a' that, an' a' that, His ribband, star, an' a' that, The man o' independent mind, He looks an' laughs at a' that. IV A prince can mak a belted knight, A marquis, duke, an' a' that! But an honest man's aboon his might— Guid faith, he mauna fa' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Their dignities, an' a' that, The pith o' sense an' pride o' worth Are higher rank than a' that. V Then let us pray that come it may (As come it will for a' that) That Sense and Worth o'er a' the earth Shall bear the gree an' a' that! For a' that, an' a' that, It's comin yet for a' that, That man to man the world o'er Shall brithers be for a' that. MARK YONDER POMP I Mark yonder pomp of costly fashion Round the wealthy, titled bride! But, when compar'd with real passion, Poor is all that princely pride. II What are the showy treasures? What are the noisy pleasures? The gay, gaudy glare of vanity and art! The polish'd jewel's blaze May draw the wond'ring gaze, And courtly grandeur bright The fancy may delight, But never, never can come near the heart! III But did you see my dearest Chloris In simplicity's array, Lovely as yonder sweet opening flower is, Shrinking from the gaze of day: IV O, then, the heart alarming And all resistless charming, In love's delightful fetters she chains the willing soul! Ambition would disown The world's imperial crown! Ev'n Avarice would deny His worshipp'd deity. And feel thro' every vein love's raptures roll! O, LET ME IN THIS AE NIGHT Chorus O, let me in this ae night, This ae, ae, ae night! O, let me in this ae night, And rise, and let me in! I O lassie, are ye sleepin yet, Or are ye waukin, I wad wit? For Love has bound me hand an' fit, And I would fain be in, jo. II Thou hear'st the winter wind an' weet: Nae star blinks thro' the driving sleet! Tak pity on my weary feet, And shield me frae the rain, jo. III The bitter blast that round me blaws, Unheeded howls, unheeded fa's: The cauldness o' thy heart's the cause Of a' my care and pine, jo. Chorus O, let me in this ae night, This ae, ae, ae night! O, let me in this ae night, And rise and let me in! HER ANSWER Chorus I tell you now this ae night, This ae, ae, ae night, And ance for a' this ae night, I winna let ye in, jo. I O, tell me na o' wind an' rain, Upbraid na me wi' cauld disdain, Gae back the gate ye cam again, I winna let ye in, jo! II The snellest blast at mirkest hours, That round the pathless wand'rer pours Is nocht to what poor she endures, That's trusted faithless man, jo. III The sweetest flower that deck'd the mead, Now trodden like the vilest weed— Let simple maid the lesson read! The weird may be her ain, jo. IV The bird that charm'd his summer day, And now the cruel fowler's prey, Let that to witless woman say:— ‘The gratefu' heart of man,’ jo Chorus I tell you now this ae night, This ae, ae, ae night, And ance for a' this ae night, I winna let ye in, jo. O PHILLY, HAPPY BE THAT DAY ChorusHe and She. For a' the joys that gowd can gie, I dinna care a single flie! The lad/lass I love's the lad/lass for me, And that's my ain dear Willy/Philly. He. IO Philly, happy be that day When, roving thro' the gather'd hay, My youthfu' heart was stown away, And by thy charms, my Philly! She. O Willy, ay I bless the grove Where first I own'd my maiden love, Whilst thou did pledge the Powers above To be my ain dear Willy. He. II As songsters of the early year Are ilka day mair sweet to hear, So ilka day to me mair dear And charming is my Philly. She. As on the brier the budding rose Still richer breathes, and fairer blows, So in my tender bosom grows The love I bear my Willy. He. III The milder sun and bluer sky, That crown my harvest cares wi' joy, Were ne'er sae welcome to my eye As is a sight o' Philly. She. The little swallow's wanton wing, Tho' wafting o'er the flowery spring, Did ne'er to me sic tidings bring As meeting o' my Willy. He. IV The bee, that thro' the sunny hour Sips nectar in the op'ning flower, Compar'd wi' my delight is poor Upon the lips o' Philly. She. The woodbine in the dewy weet, When ev'ning shades in silence meet, Is nocht sae fragrant or sae sweet As is a kiss o' Willy. He. V Let Fortune's wheel at random rin, And fools may tyne, and knaves may win! My thoughts are a' bound up on ane, And that's my ain dear Philly. She. What's a' the joys that gowd can gie? I dinna care a single flie! The lad I love's the lad for me, And that's my ain dear Willy. Chorus He and She. For a' the joys that gowd can gie, I dinna care a single flie! The lad/lass I love's the lad/lass for me, And that's my ain dear Willy/Philly. O, WERE MY LOVE I O, were my love yon lilac fair Wi' purple blossoms to the spring, And I a bird to shelter there, When wearied on my little wing, How I wad mourn when it was torn By Autumn wild and Winter rude! But I wad sing on wanton wing, When youthfu' May its bloom renew'd. II O, gin my love were yon red rose, That grows upon the castle wa', And I mysel a drap o' dew Into her bonie breast to fa', O, there, beyond expression blest, I'd feast on beauty a' the night, Seal'd on her silk-saft faulds to rest, Till fley'd awa by Phœbus' light! SLEEP'ST THOU I Sleep'st thou, or wauk'st thou, fairest creature? Rosy Morn now lifts his eye, Numbering ilka bud, which Nature Waters wi' the tears o' joy. Now to the streaming fountain Or up the heathy mountain The hart, hind, and roe, freely, wildly-wanton stray; In twining hazel bowers His lay the linnet pours; The laverock to the sky Ascends wi' sangs o' joy, While the sun and thou arise to bless the day! II Phœbus, gilding the brow of morning, Banishes ilk darksome shade, Nature gladdening and adorning: Such to me my lovely maid! When frae my Chloris parted, Sad, cheerless, broken-hearted, The night's gloomy shades, cloudy, dark, o'ercast my sky; But when she charms my sight In pride of Beauty's light, When thro' my very heart Her beaming glories dart, 'Tis then—'tis then I wake to life and joy! THERE WAS A LASS I There was a lass, and she was fair! At kirk and market to be seen When a' our fairest maids were met, The fairest maid was bonie Jean. II And ay she wrought her country wark, And ay she sang sae merrilie: The blythest bird upon the bush Had ne'er a lighter heart than she! III But hawks will rob the tender joys, That bless the little lintwhite's nest, And frost will blight the fairest flowers, And love will break the soundest rest. IV Young Robie was the brawest lad, The flower and pride of a' the glen, And he had owsen, sheep, and kye, And wanton naigies nine or ten. V He gaed wi' Jeanie to the tryste, He danc'd wi' Jeanie on the down, And, lang ere witless Jeanie wist, Her heart was tint, her peace was stown! VI As in the bosom of the stream The moon-beam dwells at dewy e'en, So, trembling pure, was tender love Within the breast of bonie Jean. VII And now she works her country's wark, And ay she sighs wi' care and pain, Yet wist na what her ail might be, Or what wad make her weel again. VIII But did na Jeanie's heart loup light, And did na joy blink in her e'e, As Robie tauld a tale o' love Ae e'enin on the lily lea? IX While monie a bird sang sweet o' love, And monie a flower blooms o'er the dale, His cheek to hers he aft did lay, And whisper'd thus his tender tale:— X ‘O Jeanie fair, I lo'e thee dear. O, canst thou think to fancy me? Or wilt thou leave thy mammie's cot, And learn to tent the farms wi' me? XI At barn or byre thou shalt na drudge, Or naething else to trouble thee, But stray amang the heather-bells, And tent the waving corn wi' me.’ XII Now what could artless Jeanie do? She had nae will to say him na! At length she blush'd a sweet consent, And love was ay between them twa. THE LEA-RIG I When o'er the hill the eastern star Tells bughtin time is near, my jo, And owsen frae the furrow'd field Return sae dowf and weary, O, Down by the burn, where scented birks Wi' dew are hangin clear, my jo, I'll meet thee on the lea-rig, My ain kind dearie, O. II At midnight hour in mirkest glen I'd rove, and ne'er be eerie, O, If thro' that glen I gaed to thee, My ain kind dearie, O! Altho' the night were ne'er sae wild, And I were ne'er sae weary, O, I'll meet thee on the lea-rig, My ain kind dearie, O. III The hunter lo'es the morning sun To rouse the mountain deer, my jo; At noon the fisher takes the glen Adown the burn to steer, my jo: Gie me the hour o' gloamin grey— It maks my heart sae cheery, O, To meet thee on the lea-rig, My ain kind dearie, O! MY WIFE'S A WINSOME WEE THING Chorus She is a winsome wee thing, She is a handsome wee thing, She is a lo'esome wee thing, This sweet wee wife o' mine! I I never saw a fairer, I never lo'ed a dearer, And neist my heart I'll wear her, For fear my jewel tine. II The warld's wrack, we share o't; The warstle and the care o't, Wi' her I'll blythely bear it, And think my lot divine. Chorus She is a winsome wee thing, She is a handsome wee thing, She is a lo'esome wee thing, This sweet wee wife o' mine MARY MORISON I O Mary, at thy window be! It is the wish'd, the trysted hour. Those smiles and glances let me see, That make the miser's treasure poor. How blythely wad I bide the stoure, A weary slave frae sun to sun, Could I the rich reward secure— The lovely Mary Morison! II Yestreen, when to the trembling string The dance gaed thro' the lighted ha', To thee my fancy took its wing, I sat, but neither heard or saw: Tho' this was fair, and that was braw, And yon the toast of a' the town, I sigh'd and said amang them a':— Ye are na Mary Morison!’ III O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace Wha for thy sake wad gladly die? Or canst thou break that heart of his Whase only faut is loving thee? If love for love thou wilt na gie, At least be pity to me shown: A thought ungentle canna be The thought o' Mary Morison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME IV MISCELLANEOUS SONGS A RUINED FARMER I The sun he is sunk in the west, All creatures retirèd to rest, While here I sit, all sore beset With sorrow, grief, and woe: And it's O fickle Fortune, O! II The prosperous man is asleep, Nor hears how the whirlwinds sweep; But Misery and I must watch The surly tempests blow: And it's O fickle Fortune, O! III There lies the dear Partner of my breast, Her cares for a moment at rest! Must I see thee, my youthful pride, Thus brought so very low?— And it's O fickle Fortune, O! IV There lie my sweet babies in her arms; No anxious fear their little hearts alarms; But for their sake my heart does ache, With many a bitter throe: And it's O fickle Fortune, O! V I once was by Fortune carest, I once could relieve the distrest; Now life's poor support, hardly earn'd, My fate will scarce bestow: And it's O fickle Fortune, O! VI No comfort, no comfort I have! How welcome to me were the grave! But then my wife and children dear— O, whither would they go! And it's O fickle Fortune, O! VII O, whither, O, whither shall I turn, All friendless, forsaken, forlorn? For in this world Rest or Peace I never more shall know: And it's O fickle Fortune, O! MONTGOMERIE'S PEGGY I Altho' my bed were in yon muir, Amang the heather, in my plaidie, Yet happy, happy would I be, Had I my dear Montgomerie's Peggy. II When o'er the hill beat surly storms, And winter nights were dark and rainy, I'd seek some dell, and in my arms I'd shelter dear Montgomerie's Peggy. III Were I a Baron proud and high, And horse and servants waiting ready, Then a' 'twad gie o' joy to me— The sharin't with Montgomerie's Peggy. THE LASS OF CESSNOCK BANKS I On Cessnock banks a lassie dwells, Could I describe her shape and mien! Our lasses a' she far excels— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! II She's sweeter than the morning dawn, When rising Phœbus first is seen, And dew-drops twinkle o'er the lawn— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! III She's stately like yon youthful ash, That grows the cowslip braes between, And drinks the stream with vigour fresh— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! IV She's spotless like the flow'ring thorn With flow'rs so white and leaves so green, When purest in the dewy morn— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! V Her looks are like the vernal May, When ev'ning Phœbus shines serene, While birds rejoice on every spray— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! VI Her hair is like the curling mist, That climbs the mountain-sides at e'en, When flow'r-reviving rains are past— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! VII Her forehead's like the show'ry bow, When gleaming sunbeams intervene, And gild the distant mountain's brow— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! VIII Her cheeks are like yon crimson gem, The pride of all the flowery scene, Just opening on its thorny stem— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! IX Her teeth are like the nightly snow, When pale the morning rises keen, While hid the murm'ring streamlets flow— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! X Her lips are like yon cherries ripe, That sunny walls from Boreas screen: They tempt the taste and charm the sight— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een! XI Her teeth are like a flock of sheep With fleeces newly washen clean, That slowly mount the rising steep— An' she has twa sparkling, rogueish een!

THO' FICKLE FORTUNE I Tho' fickle Fortune has deceived me (She promis'd fair, and perform'd but ill), Of mistress, friends, and wealth bereaved me, Yet I bear a heart shall support me still. II I'll act with prudence as far as I'm able; But if success I must never find, Then come, Misfortune, I bid thee welcome— I'll meet thee with an undaunted mind! RAGING FORTUNE I O, raging Fortune's withering blast Has laid my leaf full low! O, raging Fortune's withering blast Has laid my leaf full low! II My stem was fair, my bud was green, My blossom sweet did blow; The dew fell fresh, the sun rose mild, And made my branches grow. III But luckless Fortune's northern storms Laid a' my blossoms low! But luckless Fortune's northern storms Laid a' my blossoms low! MY FATHER WAS A FARMER I My father was a farmer upon the Carrick border, O, And carefully he bred me in decency and order, O. He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing, O, For without an honest, manly heart no man was worth regarding, O. II Then out into the world my course I did determine, O: Tho' to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming, O. My talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education, O— Resolv'd was I at least to try to mend my situation, O. III In many a way and vain essay I courted Fortune's favour, O: Some cause unseen still stept between to frustrate each endeavour, O. Sometimes by foes I was o'erpower'd, sometimes by friends forsaken, O, And when my hope was at the top, I still was worst mistaken, O. IV Then sore harass'd, and tir'd at last with Fortune's vain delusion, O, I dropt my schemes like idle dreams, and came to this conclusion, O:— The past was bad, and the future hid; its good or ill untrièd, O, But the present hour was in my pow'r, and so I would enjoy it, O. V No help, nor hope, nor view had I, nor person to befriend me, O; So I must toil, and sweat, and broil, and labour to sustain me, O! To plough and sow, to reap and mow, my father bred me early, O: For one, he said, to labour bred was a match for Fortune fairly, O. VI Thus all obscure, unknown, and poor, thro' life I'm doom'd to wander, O, Till down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber, O. No view nor care, but shun whate'er might breed me pain or sorrow, O, I live to-day as well's I may, regardless of tomorrow, O! VII But, cheerful still, I am as well as a monarch in a palace, O, Tho' Fortune's frown still hunts me down, with all her wonted malice, O: I make indeed my daily bread, but ne'er can make it farther, O, But, as daily bread is all I need, I do not much regard her, O. VIII When sometimes by my labour I earn a little money, O, Some unforeseen misfortune comes gen'rally upon me, O: Mischance, mistake, or by neglect, or my good-natur'd folly, O— But, come what will, I've sworn it still, I'll ne'er be melancholy, O. IX All you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour, O, The more in this you look for bliss, you leave your view the farther, O. Had you the wealth Potosi boasts, or nations to adore you, O, A cheerful, honest-hearted clown I will prefer before you, O! O, LEAVE NOVÉLS I O, leave novéls, ye Mauchline belles— Ye're safer at your spinning-wheel! Such witching books are baited hooks For rakish rooks like Rob Mossgiel. II Your fine Tom Jones and Grandisons They make your youthful fancies reel! They heat your brains, and fire your veins, And then you're prey for Rob Mossgiel. III Beware a tongue that's smoothly hung, A heart that warmly seems to feel! That feeling heart but acts a part— 'Tis rakish art in Rob Mossgiel. IV The frank address, the soft caress Are worse than poisoned darts of steel: The frank address and politesse Are all finesse in Rob Mossgiel. THE MAUCHLINE LADY I When first I came to Stewart Kyle, My mind it was na steady: Where'er I gaed, where'er I rade, A mistress still I had ay. II But when I came roun' by Mauchline toun, Not dreadin anybody, My heart was caught, before I thought, And by a Mauchline lady. ONE NIGHT AS I DID WANDER One night as I did wander, When corn begins to shoot, I sat me down to ponder Upon an auld tree-root: Auld Ayr ran by before me, And bicker'd to the seas; A cushat crooded o'er me, That echoed through the trees. THERE WAS A LAD Chorus Robin was a rovin boy, Rantin, rovin, rantin, rovin, Robin was a rovin boy, Rantin, rovin Robin! I There was a lad was born in Kyle, But whatna day o' whatna style, I doubt it's hardly worth the while To be sae nice wi' Robin. II Our monarch's hindmost year but ane Was five-and-twenty days begun, 'Twas then a blast o' Janwar' win' Blew hansel in on Robin. III The gossip keekit in his loof, Quo' scho:—‘Wha lives will see the proof, This waly boy will be nae coof: I think we'll ca' him Robin. IV ‘He'll hae misfortunes great an' sma', But ay a heart aboon them a'. He'll be a credit till us a': We'll a' be proud o' Robin! V ‘But sure as three times three mak nine, I see by ilka score and line, This chap will dearly like our kin', So leeze me on thee, Robin! VI ‘Guid faith,’ quo' scho, ‘I doubt you, stir, Ye gar the lasses lie aspar; But twenty fauts ye may hae waur— So blessins on thee, Robin!’ Chorus Robin was a rovin boy, Rantin, rovin, rantin, rovin, Robin was a rovin boy, Rantin, rovin Robin! WILL YE GO TO THE INDIES, MY MARY I Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary, And leave auld Scotia's shore? Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary, Across th'Atlantic roar? II O, sweet grows the lime and the orange, And the apple on the pine; But a' the charms o' the Indies Can never equal thine. III I hae sworn by the Heavens to my Mary, I hae sworn by the Heavens to be true, And sae may the Heavens forget me, When I forget my vow! IV O, plight me your faith, my Mary, And plight me your lily-white hand! O, plight me your faith, my Mary, Before I leave Scotia's strand! V We hae plighted our troth, my Mary, In mutual affection to join; And curst be the cause that shall part us! The hour and the moment o' time! HER FLOWING LOCKS I Her flowing locks, the raven's wing, Adown her neck and bosom hing. How sweet unto that breast to cling, And round that neck entwine her! II Her lips are roses wat wi' dew— O, what a feast, her bonie mou! Her cheeks a mair celestial hue, A crimson still diviner! THE LASS O' BALLOCHMYLE I 'Twas even: the dewy fields were green, On every blade the pearls hang, The zephyr wanton'd round the bean, And bore its fragrant sweets alang, In ev'ry glen the mavis sang, All Nature list'ning seem'd the while, Except where greenwood echoes rang Amang the braes o' Ballochmyle. II With careless step I onward stray'd, My heart rejoic'd in Nature's joy, When, musing in a lonely glade, A maiden fair I chanc'd to spy. Her look was like the Morning's eye, Her air like Nature's vernal smile. Perfection whisper'd, passing by:— ‘Behold the lass o' Ballochmyle!’ III Fair is the morn in flowery May, And sweet is night in autumn mild, When roving thro' the garden gay, Or wand'ring in the lonely wild; But woman, Nature's darling child— There all her charms she does compile! Even there her other works are foil'd By the bonie lass o' Ballochmyle. IV O, had she been a country maid, And I the happy country swain, Tho' shelter'd in the lowest shed That ever rose on Scotia's plain, Thro' weary winter's wind and rain With joy, with rapture, I would toil, And nightly to my bosom strain The bonie lass o' Ballochmyle! V Then Pride might climb the slipp'ry steep, Where fame and honours lofty shine, And thirst of gold might tempt the deep, Or downward seek the Indian mine! Give me the cot below the pine, To tend the flocks or till the soil, And ev'ry day have joys divine With the bonie lass o' Ballochmyle. THE NIGHT WAS STILL I The night was still, and o'er the hill The moon shone on the castle wa', The mavis sang, while dew-drops hang Around her on the castle wa': II Sae merrily they danc'd the ring Frae eenin' till the cock did craw, And ay the o'erword o' the spring Was:—‘Irvine's bairns are bonie a'!’ MASONIC SONG I Ye sons of old Killie, assembled by Willie To follow the noble vocation, Your thrifty old mother has scarce such another To sit in that honorèd station! I've little to say, but only to pray (As praying's the ton of your fashion). A prayer from the Muse you well may excuse ('Tis seldom her favourite passion):— II ‘Ye Powers who preside o'er the wind and the tide, Who markèd each element's border, Who formèd this frame with beneficent aim, Whose sovereign statute is order, Within this dear mansion may wayward Contention Or witherèd Envy ne'er enter! May Secrecy round be the mystical bound, And brotherly Love be the centre!’ THE BONIE MOOR-HEN Chorus I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men! I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men! Take some on the wing, and some as they spring, But cannily steal on a bonie moor-hen. I The heather was blooming, the meadows were mawn, Our lads gaed a-hunting ae day at the dawn, O'er moors and o'er mosses and monie a glen: At length they discovered a bonie moor-hen. II Sweet-brushing the dew from the brown heather bells, Her colours betray'd her on yon mossy fells! Her plumage outlustred the pride o' the spring, And O, as she wanton'd sae gay on the wing, III Auld Phœbus himsel', as he peep'd o'er the hill, In spite at her plumage he tryèd his skill: He level'd his rays where she bask'd on the brae— His rays were outshone, and but mark'd where she lay! IV They hunted the valley, they hunted the hill, The best of our lads wi' the best o' their skill; But still as the fairest she sat in their sight, Then, whirr! she was over, a mile at a flight. Chorus I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men! I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men! Take some on the wing, and some as they spring, But cannily steal on a bonie moor-hen. HERE'S A BOTTLE There's nane that's blest of human kind But the cheerful and the gay, man. I Here's a bottle and an honest man! What wad ye wish for mair, man? Wha kens, before his life may end, What his share may be o' care, man? II Then catch the moments as they fly, And use them as ye ought, man! Believe me, Happiness is shy, And comes not ay when sought, man! THE BONIE LASS OF ALBANIE I My heart is wae, and unco wae, To think upon the raging sea, That roars between her gardens green An' the bonie lass of Albanie. II This noble maid's of royal blood, That rulèd Albion's kingdoms three; But O, alas for her bonie face! They hae wranged the lass of Albanie. III In the rolling tide of spreading Clyde There sits an isle of high degree, And a town of fame, whose princely name Should grace the lass of Albanie. IV But there is a youth, a witless youth, That fills the place where she should be We'll send him o'er to his native shore, And bring our ain sweet Albanie! V Alas the day, and woe the day! A false usurper wan the gree, Who now commands the towers and lands, The royal right of Albanie. VI We'll daily pray, we'll nightly pray, On bended knees most fervently, That the time may come, with pipe and drum We'll welcome hame fair Albanie. AMANG THE TREES I Amang the trees, where humming bees At buds and flowers were hinging, O, Auld Caledon drew out her drone, And to her pipe was singing, O. 'Twas Pibroch, Sang, Strathspeys and Reels— She dirl'd them aff fu' clearly, O, When there cam' a yell o' foreign squeels, That dang her tapsalteerie, O! II Their capon craws an' queer ‘ha, ha's,’ They made our lugs grow eerie, O. The hungry bike did scrape and fyke, Till we were wae and weary, O. But a royal ghaist, wha ance was cas'd A prisoner aughteen year awa, He fir'd a Fiddler in the North, That dang them tapsalteerie, O! THE CHEVALIER'S LAMENT I The small birds rejoice in the green leaves returning, The murmuring streamlet winds clear thro' the vale, The primroses blow in the dews of the morning, And wild scatter'd cowslips bedeck the green dale: But what can give pleasure, or what can seem fair, When the lingering moments are number'd by care? No flow'rs gaily springing, Nor birds sweetly singing Can soothe the sad bosom of joyless despair! II The deed that I dar'd, could it merit their malice, A king and a father to place on his throne? His right are these hills, and his right are those valleys, Where the wild beasts find shelter, tho' I can find none! But 'tis not my suff'rings thus wretched, forlorn— My brave gallant friends, 'tis your ruin I mourn! Your faith prov'd so loyal In hot bloody trial, Alas! can I make it no better return? YESTREEN I HAD A PINT O' WINE I Yestreen I had a pint o' wine, A place where body saw na; Yestreen lay on this breast o' mine The gowden locks of Anna. II The hungry Jew in wilderness Rejoicing o'er his manna Was naething to my hiney bliss Upon the lips of Anna. III Ye monarchs take the East and West Frae Indus to Savannah: Gie me within my straining grasp The melting form of Anna! IV There I'll despise Imperial charms, An Empress or Sultana, While dying raptures in her arms I give and take wi' Anna! V Awa, thou flaunting God of Day! Awa, thou pale Diana! Ilk Star, gae hide thy twinkling ray, When I'm to meet my Anna! VI Come, in thy raven plumage, Night (Sun, Moon, and Stars, withdrawn a'), And bring an Angel-pen to write My transports with my Anna! POSTSCRIPT I The Kirk an' State may join, and tell To do sic things I maunna: The Kirk an' State may gae to Hell, And I'll gae to my Anna. II She is the sunshine o' my e'e, To live but her I canna: Had I on earth but wishes three, The first should be my Anna. SWEET ARE THE BANKS I Sweet are the banks, the banks o' Doon, The spreading flowers are fair, And everything is blythe and glad, But I am fu' o' care. Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, That sings upon the bough! Thou minds me o' the happy days When my fause Luve was true. Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, That sings beside thy mate, For sae I sat, and sae I sang, And wist na o' my fate! II Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon, To see the woodbine twine, And ilka bird sang o' its luve, And sae did I o' mine. Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose Upon its thorny tree, But my fause luver staw my rose, And left the thorn wi' me. Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose Upon a morn in June, And sae I flourish'd on the morn, And sae was pu'd or noon. YE FLOWERY BANKS I Ye flowery banks o' bonie Doon, How can ye blume sae fair? How can ye chant, ye little birds, And I sae fu' o' care? II Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, That sings upon the bough: Thou minds me o' the happy days When my fause Luve was true! III Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, That sings beside thy mate: For sae I sat, and sae I sang, And wist na o' my fate! IV Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon To see the woodbine twine, And ilka bird sang o' its luve, And sae did I o' mine. V Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose Frae aff its thorny tree, And my fause luver staw my rose, But left the thorn wi' me. CALEDONIA I There was on a time, but old Time was then young, That brave Caledonia, the chief of her line, From some of your northern deities sprung (Who knows not that brave Caledonia's divine?). From Tweed to the Orcades was her domain, To hunt, or to pasture, or do what she would. Her heav'nly relations there fixèd her reign, And pledged her their godheads to warrant it good. II A lambkin in peace but a lion in war, The pride of her kindred the heroine grew. Her grandsire, old Odin, triumphantly swore:— ‘Whoe'er shall provoke thee, th'encounter shall rue!’ With tillage or pasture at times she would sport, To feed her fair flocks by her green rustling corn; But chiefly the woods were her fav'rite resort, Her darling amusement the hounds and the horn. III Long quiet she reign'd, till thitherward steers A flight of bold eagles from Adria's strand. Repeated, successive, for many long years, They darken'd the air, and they plunder'd the land. Their pounces were murder, and horror their cry; They'd conquer'd and ravag'd a world beside. She took to her hills, and her arrows let fly— The daring invaders, they fled or they died! IV The Cameleon-Savage disturb'd her repose, With tumult, disquiet, rebellion, and strife. Provok'd beyond bearing, at last she arose, And robbed him at once of his hopes and his life. The Anglian Lion, the terror of France, Oft, prowling, ensanguin'd the Tweed's silver flood, But, taught by the bright Caledonian lance, He learnèd to fear in his own native wood. V The fell Harpy-Raven took wing from the north, The scourge of the seas, and the dread of the shore; The wild Scandinavian Boar issued forth To wanton in carnage and wallow in gore; O'er countries and kingdoms their fury prevail'd, No arts could appease them, no arms could repel; But brave Caledonia in vain they assail'd, As Largs well can witness, and Loncartie tell. VI Thus bold, independent, unconquer'd, and free, Her bright course of glory for ever shall run, For brave Caledonia immortal must be, I'll prove it from Euclid as clear as the sun:— Rectangle-triangle, the figure we'll chuse; The upright is Chance, and old Time is the base, But brave Caledonia's the hypothenuse; Then, ergo, she'll match them, and match them always! YOU'RE WELCOME, WILLIE STEWART Chorus You're welcome, Willie Stewart! You're welcome, Willie Stewart! There's ne'er a flower that blooms in May, That's half sae welcome's thou art! I Come, bumpers high! express your joy! The bowl we maun renew it— The tappet hen, gae bring her ben, To welcome Willie Stewart! II May foes be strong, and friends be slack! Ilk action, may he rue it! May woman on him turn her back, That wrangs thee, Willie Stewart! Chorus You're welcome, Willie Stewart! You're welcome, Willie Stewart! There's ne'er a flower that blooms in May, That's half sae welcome's thou art! WHEN FIRST I SAW Chorus She's aye, aye sae blithe, sae gay, She's aye sae blithe and cheerie, She's aye sae bonie, blithe and gay, O, gin I were her dearie! I When first I saw fair Jeanie's face, I couldna tell what ail'd me: My heart went fluttering pit-a-pat, My een they almost fail'd me. She's aye sae neat, sae trim, sae tight, All grace does round her hover! Ae look depriv'd me o' my heart, And I became her lover. II Had I Dundas's whole estate, Or Hopetoun's wealth to shine in; Did warlike laurels crown my brow, Or humbler bays entwining; I'd lay them a' at Jeanie's feet, Could I but hope to move her, And, prouder than a belted knight, I'd be my Jeanie's lover. III But sair I fear some happier swain, Has gain'd my Jeanie's favour. If so, may every bliss be hers, Though I maun never have her! But gang she east, or gang she west, 'Twixt Forth and Tweed all over, While men have eyes, or ears, or taste, She'll always find a lover. Chorus She's aye, aye sae blithe, sae gay, She's aye sae blithe and cheerie, She's aye sae bonie, blithe and gay, O, gin I were her dearie! BEHOLD THE HOUR FIRST SET I Behold the hour, the boat, arrive! My dearest Nancy, O, farewell! Sever'd frae thee, can I survive, Frae thee whom I hae lov'd sae well? II Endless and deep shall be my grief, Nae ray of comfort shall I see, But this most precious, dear belief, That thou wilt still remember me. III Along the solitary shore, Where flitting sea-fowl round me cry, Across the rolling, dashing roar, I'll westward turn my wistful eye. IV ‘Happy thou Indian grove,’ I'll say, ‘Where now my Nancy's path shall be! While thro' your sweets she holds her way, O, tell me, does she muse on me?’ HERE'S A HEALTH TO THEM THAT'S AWA I Here's a health to them that's awa, Here's a health to them that's awa! And wha winna wish guid luck to our cause, May never guid luck be their fa'! It's guid to be merry and wise, It's guid to be honest and true, It's guid to support Caledonia's cause And bide by the buff and the blue. II Here's a health to them that's awa, Here's a health to them that's awa! Here's a health to Charlie, the chief o' the clan, Altho' that his band be sma'! May Liberty meet wi' success, May Prudence protect her frae evil! May tyrants and Tyranny tine i' the mist And wander their way to the Devil! III Here's a health to them that's awa, Here's a health to them that's awa! Here's a health to Tammie, the Norlan' laddie, That lives at the lug o' the Law! Here's freedom to them that wad read, Here's freedom to them that would write! There's nane ever fear'd that the truth should be heard But they whom the truth would indite! IV Here's a health to them that's awa, An' here's to them that's awa! Here's to Maitland and Wycombe! Let wha does na like 'em Be built in a hole in the wa'! Here's timmer that's red at the heart, Here's fruit that is sound at the core, And may he that wad turn the buff and blue coat Be turn'd to the back o' the door! V Here's a health to them that's awa, Here's a health to them that's awa! Here's Chieftain M'Leod, a chieftain worth gowd, Tho' bred amang mountains o' snaw! Here's friends on baith sides o' the Firth, And friends on baith sides o' the Tweed, And wha wad betray old Albion's right, May they never eat of her bread! AH, CHLORIS I Ah, Chloris, since it may not be That thou of love wilt hear, If from the lover thou maun flee, Yet let the friend be dear! II Altho' I love my Chloris mair Than ever tongue could tell, My passion I will ne'er declare— I'll say, I wish thee well. III Tho' a' my daily care thou art, And a' my nightly dream, I'll hide the struggle in my heart, And say it is esteem. PRETTY PEG I As I gaed up by yon gate-end, When day was waxin weary, Wha did I meet come down the street But pretty Peg, my dearie? II Her air so sweet, her shape complete, Wi' nae proportion wanting— The Queen of Love could never move Wi' motion mair enchanting! III With linkèd hands we took the sands Down by yon winding river; And O! that hour, and shady bow'r, Can I forget it? Never! MEG O' THE MILL SECOND SET I O, ken ye what Meg o' the mill has gotten? An' ken ye what Meg o' the mill has gotten? She's gotten a coof wi' a claute o' siller, And broken the heart o' the barley miller! II The miller was strappin, the miller was ruddy, A heart like a lord, and a hue like a lady. The laird was a widdifu', bleerit knurl— She's left the guid fellow, and taen the churl! III The miller, he hecht her a heart leal and loving. The laird did address her wi' matter more moving: A fine pacing-horse wi' a clear, chainèd bridle, A whip by her side, and a bonie side saddle! IV O, wae on the siller—it is sae prevailing! And wae on the love that is fixed on a mailen! A tocher's nae word in a true lover's parl, But gie me my love and a fig for the warl! PHILLIS THE FAIR I While larks with little wing Fann'd the pure air, Viewing the breathing Spring, Forth I did fare. Gay, the sun's golden eye Peep'd o'er the mountains high; ‘Such thy bloom,’ did I cry— ‘Phillis the fair!’ II In each bird's careless song, Glad, I did share; While yon wild flowers among, Chance led me there. Sweet to the opening day, Rosebuds bent the dewy spray; ‘Such thy bloom,’ did I say— ‘Phillis the fair!’ III Down in a shady walk Doves cooing were; I mark'd the cruel hawk Caught in a snare. So kind may Fortune be! Such make his destiny, He who would injure thee, Phillis the fair! O SAW YE MY DEAR, MY PHILLY I O, saw ye my Dear, my Philly? O, saw ye my Dear, my Philly? She's down i' the grove, she's wi' a new love, She winna come hame to her Willy. II What says she my Dear, my Philly? What says she my Dear, my Philly? She lets thee to wit she has thee forgot, And for ever disowns thee, her Willy. III O, had I ne'er seen thee, my Philly! O, had I ne'er seen thee, my Philly! As light as the air, and fause as thou's fair, Thou's broken the heart o' thy Willy. 'TWAS NA HER BONIE BLUE E'E I 'Twas na her bonie blue e'e was my ruin: Fair tho' she be, that was ne'er my undoin. 'Twas the dear smile when naebody did mind us, 'Twas the bewitching, sweet, stoun glance o' kindness! II Sair do I fear that to hope is denied me, Sair do I fear that despair maun abide me; But tho' fell Fortune should fate us to sever, Queen shall she be in my bosom for ever. III Chloris, I'm thine wi' a passion sincerest, And thou hast plighted me love o' the dearest, And thou'rt the angel that never can alter— Sooner the sun in his motion would falter! WHY, WHY TELL THY LOVER I Why, why tell thy lover Bliss he never must enjoy? Why, why undeceive him, And give all his hopes the lie? II O, why, while Fancy, raptur'd, slumbers, ‘Chloris, Chloris,’ all the theme, Why, why wouldst thou, cruel, Wake thy lover from his dream? THE PRIMROSE I Dost ask me, why I send thee here The firstling of the infant year: This lovely native of the vale, That hangs so pensive and so pale? II Look on its bending stalk, so weak, That, each way yielding, doth not break, And see how aptly it reveals The doubts and fears a lover feels. III Look on its leaves of yellow hue Bepearl'd thus with morning dew, And these will whisper in thine ears:— ‘The sweets of loves are wash'd with tears.’ O, WERT THOU IN THE CAULD BLAST I O, wert thou in the cauld blast On yonder lea, on yonder lea, My plaidie to the angry airt, I'd shelter thee, I'd shelter thee. Or did Misfortune's bitter storms Around thee blaw, around thee blaw, Thy bield should be my bosom, To share it a', to share it a'. II Or were I in the wildest waste, Sae black and bare, sae black and bare, The desert were a Paradise, If thou wert there, if thou wert there. Or were I monarch of the globe, Wi' thee to reign, wi' thee to reign, The brightest jewel in my crown Wad be my queen, wad be my queen. INTERPOLATIONS YOUR FRIENDSHIP I Your friendship much can make me blest— O, why that bliss destroy? Why urge the only, one request You know I will deny? II Your thought, if Love must harbour there, Conceal it in that thought, Nor cause me from my bosom tear The very friend I sought. FOR THEE IS LAUGHING NATURE For thee is laughing Nature gay, For thee she pours the vernal day: For me in vain is Nature drest, While Joy's a stranger to my breast. NO COLD APPROACH No cold approach, no alter'd mien, Just what would make suspicion start, No pause the dire extremes between: He made me blest—and broke my heart. ALTHO' HE HAS LEFT ME Altho' he has left me for greed o' the siller, I dinna envý him the gains he can win: I rather wad bear a' the lade o' my sorrow Than ever hae acted sae faithless to him. LET LOOVE SPARKLE Let loove sparkle in her e'e, Let her lo'e nae man but me: That's the tocher guid I prize, There the luver's treasure lies. AS DOWN THE BURN As down the burn they took their way, And thro' the flowery dale; His cheek to hers he aft did lay, And love was ay the tale, With:—‘Mary, when shall we return, Sic pleasure to renew?’ Quoth Mary:—‘Love, I like the burn, And ay shall follow you.’ IMPROBABLES ON ROUGH ROADS I'm now arriv'd—thanks to the Gods!— Through pathways rough and muddy: A certain sign that makin' roads Is no this people's study. Yet, though I'm no wi' scripture cramm'd, I'm sure the Bible says That heedless sinners shall be damn'd, Unless they mend their ways. ELEGY ON STELLA I Strait is the spot, and green the sod, From whence my sorrows flow; And soundly sleeps the ever dear Inhabitant below. II Pardon my transport, gentle shade, While o'er the turf I bow! Thy earthly house is circumscrib'd, And solitary now! III Not one poor stone to tell thy name Or make thy virtues known! But what avails to thee—to me— The sculpture of a stone? IV I'll sit me down upon this turf, And wipe away this tear. The chill blast passes swiftly by, And flits around thy bier. V Dark is the dwelling of the dead, And sad their house of rest: Low lies the head by Death's cold arm In awful fold embraced. VI I saw the grim Avenger stand Incessant by thy side; Unseen by thee, his deadly breath Thy lingering frame destroy'd. VII Pale grew the roses on thy cheek, And wither'd was thy bloom, Till the slow poison brought thy youth Untimely to the tomb. VIII Thus wasted are the ranks of men— Youth, health, and beauty fall! The ruthless ruin spreads around, And overwhelms us all. IX Behold where, round thy narrow house, The graves unnumber'd lie! The multitude, that sleep below, Existed but to die. X Some with the tottering steps of Age Trod down the darksome way; And some in Youth's lamented prime, Like thee, were torn away. XI Yet these, however hard their fate, Their native earth receives: Amid their weeping friends they died, And fill their fathers' graves. XII From thy lov'd friends, when first thy heart, Was taught by Heaven to glow, Far, far remov'd, the ruthless stroke Surpris'd, and laid thee low. XIII At the last limits of our Isle, Wash'd by the western wave, Touch'd by thy fate, a thoughtful Bard Sits lonely on thy grave! XIV Pensive he eyes, before him spread, The deep, outstretch'd and vast. His mourning notes are borne away Along the rapid blast. XV And while, amid the silent dead, Thy hapless fate he mourns, His own long sorrows freshly bleed, And all his grief returns. XVI Like thee, cut off in early youth And flower of beauty's pride, His friend, his first and only joy, His much-lov'd Stella died. XVII Him, too, the stern impulse of Fate Resistless bears along, And the same rapid tide shall whelm The Poet and the Song. XVIII The tear of pity, which he shed, He asks not to receive: Let but his poor remains be laid Obscurely in the grave! XIX His grief-worn heart with truest joy Shall meet the welcome shock; His airy harp shall lie unstrung And silent on the rock. XX O my dear maid, my Stella, when Shall this sick period close, And lead the solitary Bard To his belov'd repose? POEM ON PASTORAL POETRY I Hail, Poesie! thou Nymph reserv'd! In chase o' thee, what crowds hae swerv'd Frae common sense, or sunk enerv'd 'Mang heaps o' clavers! And och! o'er aft thy joes hae starv'd 'Mid a' thy favours! II Say, Lassie, why thy train amang, While loud the trump's heroic clang, And sock or buskin skelp alang To death or marriage, Scarce ane has tried the shepherd-sang But wi' miscarriage? III In Homer's craft Jock Milton thrives; Eschýlus' pen Will Shakespeare drives; Wee Pope, the knurlin, till him rives Horatian fame; In thy sweet sang, Barbauld, survives Even Sappho's flame! IV But thee, Theocritus, wha matches? They're no herd's ballats, Maro's catches! Squire Pope but busks his skinklin patches O' heathen tatters! I pass by hunders, nameless wretches, That ape their betters. V In this braw age o' wit and lear, Will nane the Shepherd's whistle mair Blaw sweetly in its native air And rural grace, And wi' the far-fam'd Grecian share A rival place? VI Yes! there is ane—a Scottish callan! There's ane! Come forrit, honest Allan! Thou need na jouk behint the hallan, A chiel sae clever! The teeth o' Time may gnaw Tantallan, But thou's for ever. VII Thou paints auld Nature to the nines In thy sweet Caledonian lines! Nae gowden stream thro' myrtles twines, Where Philomel, While nightly breezes sweep the vines, Her griefs will tell: VIII In gowany glens thy burnie strays, Where bonie lasses bleach their claes, Or trots by hazelly shaws and braes Wi' hawthorns gray, Where blackbirds join the shepherd's lays At close o' day. IX Thy rural loves are Nature's sel': Nae bombast spates o' nonsense swell, Nae snap conceits, but that sweet spell O' witchin love, That charm that can the strongest quell, The sternest move. ON THE DESTRUCTION OF DRUMLANRIG WOODS I As on the banks of winding Nith Ae smiling simmer morn I stray'd, And traced its bonie holms and haughs, Where linties sang, and lammies play'd, I sat me down upon a craig, And drank my fill o' fancy's dream, When from the eddying deep below Up rose the Genius of the Stream. II Dark like the frowning rock his brow, And troubled like his wintry wave, And deep as sughs the boding wind Amang his caves the sigh he gave. ‘And come ye here, my son,’ he cried, ‘To wander in my birken shade? To muse some favourite Scottish theme, Or sing some favourite Scottish maid? III ‘There was a time, it's nae lang syne, Ye might hae seen me in my pride, When a' my banks sae bravely saw Their woody pictures in my tide; When hanging beech and spreading elm Shaded my stream sae clear and cool; And stately oaks their twisted arms Threw broad and dark across the pool; IV ‘When, glinting thro' the trees, appear'd The wee white cot aboon the mill, And peaceful rose its ingle reek, That, slowly curling, clamb the hill. But now the cot is bare and cauld, Its leafy bield for ever gane, And scarce a stinted birk is left To shiver in the blast its lane.’ V ‘Alas!’ quoth I, ‘what ruefu' chance Has twin'd ye o' your stately trees? Has laid your rocky bosom bare? Has stripp'd the cleeding aff your braes? Was it the bitter eastern blast, That scatters blight in early spring? Or was't the wil'fire scorch'd their boughs? Or canker-worm wi' secret sting?’ VI ‘Nae eastlin blast,’ the Sprite replied— ‘It blaws na here sae fierce and fell, And on my dry and halesome banks Nae canker-worms get leave to dwell: Man! cruel man!’ the Genius sigh'd, As through the cliffs he sank him down: ‘The worm that gnaw'd my bonie trees, That reptile wears a Ducal crown.’ THE JOYFUL WIDOWER I I married with a scolding wife The fourteenth of November: She made me weary of my life By one unruly member. Long did I bear the heavy yoke, And many griefs attended, But to my comfort be it spoke, Now, now her life is ended! II We liv'd full one-and-twenty years A man and wife together. At length from me her course she steer'd And gone I know not whither. Would I could guess, I do profess: I speak, and do not flatter, Of all the women in the world, I never would come at her! III Her body is bestowèd well— A handsome grave does hide her. But sure her soul is not in Hell— The Deil would ne'er abide her! I rather think she is aloft And imitating thunder, For why?—Methinks I hear her voice Tearing the clouds asunder! WHY SHOULD WE IDLY WASTE OUR PRIME I Why should we idly waste our prime Repeating our oppressions? Come rouse to arms! 'Tis now the time To punish past transgressions. 'Tis said that Kings can do no wrong— Their murderous deeds deny it, And, since from us their power is sprung, We have a right to try it. Now each true patriot's song shall be:— ‘Welcome Death or Libertie!’ II Proud Priests and Bishops we'll translate And canonize as Martyrs; The guillotine on Peers shall wait; And Knights shall hang in garters. Those Despots long have trode us down, And Judges are their engines: Such wretched minions of a Crown Demand the people's vengeance! To-day 'tis theirs. To-morrow we Shall don the Cap of Libertie! III The Golden Age we'll then revive: Each man will be a brother; In harmony we all shall live, And share the earth together; In Virtue train'd, enlighten'd Youth Will love each fellow-creature; And future years shall prove the truth That Man is good by nature: Then let us toast with three times three The reign of Peace and Libertie! THE TREE OF LIBERTY I Heard ye o' the Tree o' France, And wat ye what's the name o't? Around it a' the patriots dance— Weel Europe kens the fame o't! It stands where ance the Bastile stood— A prison built by kings, man, When Superstition's hellish brood Kept France in leading-strings, man. II Upo' this tree there grows sic fruit, Its virtues a' can tell, man: It raises man aboon the brute, It mak's him ken himsel', man! Gif ance the peasant taste a bit, He's greater than a lord, man, And wi' the beggar shares a mite O' a' he can afford, man. III This fruit is worth a' Afric's wealth: To comfort us 'twas sent, man, To gie the sweetest blush o' health, And mak' us a' content, man! It clears the een, it cheers the heart, Mak's high and low guid friends, man, And he wha acts the traitor's part, It to perdition sends, man. IV My blessings ay attend the chiel, Wha pitied Gallia's slaves, man, And staw a branch, spite o' the Deil, Frae 'yont the western waves, man! Fair Virtue water'd it wi' care, And now she sees wi' pride, man, How weel it buds and blossoms there, Its branches spreading wide, man. V But vicious folk ay hate to see The works o' Virtue thrive, man: The courtly vermin's bann'd the tree, And grat to see it thrive, man! King Louis thought to cut it down, When it was unco sma', man; For this the watchman crack'd his crown, Cut aff his head and a', man. VI A wicked crew syne, on a time, Did tak' a solemn aith, man, It ne'er should flourish to its prime— I wat they pledg'd their faith, man! Awa they gaed wi' mock parade, Like beagles hunting game, man, But soon grew weary o' the trade, And wish'd they'd been at hame, man. VII Fair Freedom, standing by the tree, Her sons did loudly ca', man. She sang a sang o' Liberty, Which pleas'd them ane and a', man. By her inspir'd, the new-born race Soon drew the avenging steel, man. The hirelings ran—her foes gied chase, And bang'd the despot weel, man. VIII Let Britain boast her hardy oak, Her poplar, and her pine, man! Auld Britain ance could crack her joke, And o'er her neighbours shine, man! But seek the forest round and round, And soon 'twill be agreed, man, That sic a tree can not be found 'Twixt London and the Tweed, man. IX Without this tree alake this life Is but a vale o' woe, man, A scene o' sorrow mix'd wi' strife, Nae real joys we know, man; We labour soon, we labour late, To feed the titled knave, man, And a' the comfort we 're to get, Is that ayont the grave, man. X Wi' plenty o' sic trees, I trow, The warld would live in peace, man. The sword would help to mak' a plough, The din o' war wad cease, man. Like brethren in a common cause, We'd on each other smile, man; And equal rights and equal laws Wad gladden every isle, man. XI Wae worth the loon wha wadna eat Sic halesome, dainty cheer, man! I'd gie the shoon frae aff my feet, To taste the fruit o't here, man! Syne let us pray, Auld England may Sure plant this far-famed tree, man; And blythe we'll sing, and herald the day That gives us libertý, man. TO A KISS I Humid seal of soft affections, Tend'rest pledge of future bliss, Dearest tie of young connections, Love's first snow-drop, virgin kiss! II Speaking silence, dumb confession, Passion's birth and infant's play, Dove-like fondness, chaste confession, Glowing dawn of brighter day! III Sorrowing joy, adieu's last action, Ling'ring lips—no more must join! Words can never speak affection, Thrilling and sincere as thine! DELIA AN ODE I Fair the face of orient day, Fair the tints of op'ning rose: But fairer still my Delia dawns, More lovely far her beauty blows. II Sweet the lark's wild-warbled lay, Sweet the tinkling rill to hear: But, Delia, more delightful still Steal thine accents on mine ear. III The flower-enamoured busy bee The rosy banquet loves to sip; Sweet the streamlet's limpid lapse To the sun-brown'd Arab's lip: IV But, Delia, on thy balmy lips Let me, no vagrant insect, rove! O, let me steal one liquid kiss! For O! my soul is parch'd with love! TO THE OWL I Sad bird of night, what sorrow calls thee forth, To vent thy plaints thus in the midnight hour? Is it some blast that gathers in the north, Threat'ning to nip the verdure of thy bow'r? II Is it, sad owl, that Autumn strips the shade, And leaves thee here, unshelter'd and forlorn? Or fear that Winter will thy nest invade? Or friendless Melancholy bids thee mourn? III Shut out, lone bird, from all the feather'd train, To tell thy sorrows to th'unheeding gloom, No friend to pity when thou dost complain, Grief all thy thought, and solitude thy home, IV Sing on, sad mourner! I will bless thy strain, And pleas'd in sorrow listen to thy song. Sing on, sad mourner! To the night complain, While the lone echo wafts thy notes along. V Is Beauty less, when down the glowing cheek Sad, piteous tears in native sorrows fall? Less kind the heart when anguish bids it break? Less happy he who lists to Pity's call? VI Ah no, sad owl! nor is thy voice less sweet, That Sadness tunes it, and that Grief is there? That Spring's gay notes, unskill'd, thou can't repeat, That Sorrow bids thee to the gloom repair! VII Nor that the treble songsters of the day, Are quite estranged, sad bird of night, from thee! Nor that the thrush deserts the evening spray, When darkness calls thee from thy reverie! VIII From some old tower, thy melancholy dome, While the gray walls and desert solitudes Return each note, responsive to the gloom Of ivied coverts and surrounding woods: IX There hooting, I will list more pleased to thee, Than ever lover to the nightingale, Or drooping wretch, oppress'd with misery, Lending his ear to some condoling tale! THE VOWELS A TALE 'Twas where the birch and sounding thong are ply'd, The noisy domicile of pedant pride; Where Ignorance her darkening vapour throws, And Cruelty directs the thickening blows! Upon a time, Sir A B C the great, In all his pedagogic powers elate, His awful chair of state resolves to mount, And call the trembling Vowels to account. First enter'd A, a grave, broad, solemn wight, But, ah! deform'd, dishonest to the sight! His twisted head look'd backward on his way, And flagrant from the scourge he grunted, ai! Reluctant, E stalk'd in; a piteous case, The justling tears ran down his honest face! That name, that well-worn name, and all his own, Pale, he surrenders at the tyrant's throne! The Pedant stifles keen the Roman sound Not all his mongrel diphthongs can compound; And next the title following close behind, He to the nameless, ghastly wretch assign'd. The cobwebb'd gothic dome resounded, Y! In sullen vengeance, I disdain'd reply: The Pedant swung his felon cudgel round, And knock'd the groaning vowel to the ground! In rueful apprehension enter'd O, The wailing minstrel of despairing woe: Th'Inquisitor of Spain the most expert, Might there have learnt new mysteries of his art. So grim, deform'd, with horrors entering, U His dearest friend and brother scarcely knew! As trembling U stood staring all aghast, The Pedant in his left hand clutch'd him fast, In helpless infants' tears he dipp'd his right, Baptiz'd him eu, and kick'd him from his sight. ON THE ILLNESS OF A FAVOURITE CHILD I Now health forsakes that angel face. Nae mair my dearie smiles. Pale sickness withers ilka grace, And a' my hopes beguiles. II The cruel Powers reject the prayer I hourly mak' for thee: Ye Heavens! how great is my despair! How can I see him die! ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE CHILD I O, sweet be thy sleep in the land of the grave, My dear little angel, for ever! For ever?—O no! let not man be a slave, His hopes from existence to sever! II Though cold be the clay, where thou pillow'st thy head In the dark, silent mansions of sorrow, The spring shall return to thy low, narrow bed, Like the beam of the day-star to-morrow. III The flower-stem shall bloom like thy sweet seraph form Ere the spoiler had nipt thee in blossom, When thou shrank frae the scowl of the loud winter storm, And nestled thee close to that bosom. IV O, still I behold thee, all lovely in death, Reclined on the lap of thy mother, When the tear-trickle bright, when the short stifled breath Told how dear ye were ay to each other. V My child, thou art gone to the home of thy rest, Where suffering no longer can harm thee: Where the songs of the Good, where the hymns of the Blest Through an endless existence shall charm thee! VI While he, thy fond parent, must sighing sojourn Through the dire desert regions of sorrow, O'er the hope and misfortune of being to mourn, And sigh for this life's latest morrow. ADDENDUM TO MALLY'S MEEK Her yellow hair, beyond compare, Comes tumbling down her swan-white neck, And her twa eyes, like stars in skies, Would keep a sinking ship frae wreck!</field>
