      <field name="fulltext">DIVINE EMBLEMS. EMBLEM I. For by the works of the law, shall no flesh be justified. GAL. chap. 2, v. 16. [Why is this darkness?—Phœbus shone most bright] Why is this darkness?—Phœbus shone most bright E'en now—and now, it is Cimmerian night! What have I done, that Thou shouldst veil his face From me—to sun the profligate and base?— What thoughtless deed—what meditated sin Of mine—hath roused this ceaseless thundering? Have I not read thy Law; and kept it too? Done all—and more than Thou command'st me do? Denied the flesh—fulfilled mount Sinai's law? Display a blemish—I discern no flaw. Was it for this, I've borne the world's rebuke, Eschew'd its fashions—hid me in a nook Recluse! lest through mine eyes, my loyal heart Should swerve—and from thy holy law depart. Could I do more, to gain thy radiant smile— What more—thy heavenly favours to beguile? Yet vain have been my vigils—watch and ward— If night and thund'rings be my sole reward! When did I fail in doing my best do To merit Heaven?—thy Word's my surety true. Forbear thine anger!—bid thy thunders cease— My limbs are palsied—and my fears increase! I may have sinn'd; but, Lord! I know not when: In thought I may have wander'd—but what then, In act I'm pure—what canst thou wish for more? Augment not, Lord! my sin-abounding score. No “still small voice!”—thy thunderings do not cease Lord!—does thy wrath with my dismay increase? Oh, I am helpless, Lord! vouchsafe one glimmering ray, That I may know thy will—and see my way: By man false school'd, oh, teach me, Lord, to read Thy word aright—Lord! help me in my need. Heart-broken—poor—benighted—full of sin— With works bespangled—but bedaub'd within! Oh whisper comfort to my labouring soul! If thought can sin—do Thou my thoughts control. Have mercy, Lord!—command thy thunders cease; Stay thou mine aspen limbs—my fears decrease! Beyond the hills, methinks I ken a ray— Hail, Phospher! harbinger of day! Come! come Redeemer! oh, dispel this gloom This terror night has been full long my doom! Yes, I have err'd!—to trust to mortal arm, To works, and merits—as if they could charm Eternal justice!—when the thought's required To be as perfect as the deed desired! Come, Saviour! come, in radiance bright, Warm my clamm'd limbs—dismiss this Stygian night Increase my love!—the sin-atoning Lamb Alone can shelter from the stern I AM! The sufficiency of my merit is to know that my merit is not sufficient. S. AUGUST. The ray of hope that breaks upon the benighted soul, is cheering as the morning star to the sick prisoner languishing for the time of the warder's rising; he hopes once again to be placed under the canopy of heaven. ANON. Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the land darkened. ISAIAH, chap. 9, v. 19. Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works. IB. chap. 59, v. 6. Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. IB. chap. 60, v. 1. Darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 1 JOHN, chap. 2, v. 8. Not of works, lest any man should boast. EPH. chap. 2, v. 9. EPIG. [What though thy sun gives warmth and light and life!] What though thy sun gives warmth and light and life! Does he not hatch the dying maggot-fly? My Sun revives benighted souls! which rife Live through a bliss-prepared eternity! EMBLEM II. What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? MARK, chap. 8, v. 36. [Whither away, fond Boy?—thy fling of pleasure] I Whither away, fond Boy?—thy fling of pleasure Thou hast enjoyed—without control or measure: Thy whim exhausts not!—and the World but seems A willing agent, to thy waking dreams— But will it always prove as willing as it seems? II Though calm and sunshine—and the gentle breezes Attending, fan thee—and the gliding pleases— Though confidence be buoyant, and thy skill Be surety 'gainst a common chance of ill: A blast may rend thy sail—a wave thy fortunes spill. III Unthwarted hankerings sure have turn'd thy brain— What! seek new pleasures o'er so foul a main? Thy hollow bark—should zephyrs turn to gusts, Will shift its ballast—and the fool that trusts Its specious loyalty—be overwhelmed in lusts. IV And art thou still of mind to venture out Beyond thy ken? Young Steersman! put about Before the Pharos sinks—be not so keck! Thy unrestrained career may meet a check I'th' sea—although on land thou could'st not break thy neck. V Poor, blind, inflated Boy! thou dost not see The rocks and shoals, that almost stare at thee; Charybdis yawns—and Scylla's iron shore In vain rejects the waves, with loudest roar— Thou hast no ear; no eye, to shun or to explore. The flesh is to be satisfied so far as suffices to our good; whosoever alloweth so much to her as to make her proud, knoweth not how to be satisfied: to be satisfied is a great art; lest by the satiety of the flesh we break forth into the iniquity of her folly. S. GREG. Hom. 3, secund. parte. Ezech. For Mammon is a chief tempter—he hath under his control riches, honours, pleasures, and giveth fair weather revels to foul souls. ANON. The heart is a small thing, but desireth great matters—it is not sufficient for a kite's dinner, yet the whole world is not sufficient for it. HUGO, de animâ. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. ISAIAH, chap. 55, v. 7. There is no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches. ECCLES. chap. 4, v. 8. EPIG. [The wayward Boy, whose foolish loving mother] The wayward Boy, whose foolish loving mother Permits him domineer o'er servants, sister, brother! Fancies such mute endurance of his kicks and blows Results from power in him—so with his growth he grows A braggart!—till some rustic urchin mar his nose! EMBLEM III. The waves compassed me about, even unto the soul, the depth closed me round, the weeds were wrapt about my head. JONAH, chap. 2, v. 5. [A dainty voyage thou hast made, forsooth] I A dainty voyage thou hast made, forsooth, In grasping search of El Dorado! Is it thy fancied skill hath wrought thee ruth? Or art capsiz'd by a tornado? Or has thy bubble-bark—too light—too crank— Shifted its ballast—and expos'd its flank To the boist'rous wind; to play thee off a prank? II Whate'er the cause; thou art in doleful plight: Besotted and besopp'd is thy condition! Thy honours and renown have taken flight! And thou thyself fast sinking to perdition, Thou art chin-deep immers'd in lusts!— Sure fate of him who seeks and trusts A wanton World—hot spices bring on thirsts! III Where is thy helmet—and thy warlike gear? Thy money-bags, and deeds and gaming toys? And smiles?—all gone!—what hast thou left? a tear To brine that cheek so late suffused with joys— Infatuate youth!—still cling'st thou to thy foe? Uncoil thy leg—and learn thy curse to know— One moment—and she swamps thee!—let her go. IV Cast off—and make for shore—behold! A shield still floats—and wooes thy panting breast: Repent—and cherish hope—in hope be bold That grace may save—repentance is the test! Repentance—to the soul gives kind relief: Repentance—changes hope, to sure belief: Repentance—saved the sighing dying thief! Tell me, where be those now, that so lately loved and hugged the World? HUGO, de animâ. But I tell you a storm shall arise, thy light bark shall be shattered, and all thy choice Argosie—riches, power, pride, honours, be lost, and thyself gasping in lusts—thy haughtiness craving the help even of a straw—eschew the empty world, for its love is death. ANON. They shall be as chaff that is driven with a whirlwind out of the floor. HOSEA, chap. 13, v. 3. EPIG. [What is the World?—a field of flowers, and weeds, and stubble!] What is the World?—a field of flowers, and weeds, and stubble! And life?—a very schoolboy's soapen bubble! Which if a fly but cross its airy way, The bubble bursts—the Globe has passed away! EMBLEM IV. Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! PSALM 120, v. 5. [—Seductive World, we've had enough of thee!] Soul. —Seductive World, we've had enough of thee! Beshrew thy power! my Sister must be free— She is no slave of thine—nor master thou to me! II Thou didst allure us, with enticing sweets— Before us placed thy gay delusive treats— And trapped us with thy soul-destroying gilded cheats. III By subtle fumes, that o'er my senses stole, Caution was lull'd—thou didst obtain control Over my yielding Sister: whilst still slept her soul! IV Awake, I gave thy opiates to the wind, Dared thee to stay the unconsenting mind! And the unwilling body must not be confined. Mammon. —I do retain her till she pays the debt For jewels, feasts, and robes of golden net— Down beds of Tyrian hue and costly mansions let. Soul. —What she partook—thou didst invite her to, And woful retchings she did undergo From the seductive sweets!—the debt is false you know! VII In the same rustic garb she's clad, as erst, Ere your deceptive blandishments accurst Enticed her wandering eye—and on her senses burst. Mammon. —She had her will, she wanted no decoy To woo to pleasure and a life of joy— Oh no! a world of pleasure is too choice a toy! Soul. —Sister! thou would'st be free from thy disgrace? Body. —Oh yes! Soul. —Thou would'st not while in leagues so base? Body. Oh no! Soul. —Dost hear, thou fiend of double face? Soul. —Now, Sister, break his bonds—try—do thy best! Some severed bands thy willing will attest! Behold! the Bridegroom comes—his pow'r will do the rest! It is the Devil's part to suggest: ours not to consent. As oft as we resist him, so often we overcome him: so often we bring joy to the Angels and glory to God, who prepareth us that we may contend, and assisteth us that we may conquer. S. BERNH. For the Devil may suggest, compel he cannot. S. CHRYS. sup. Matth. I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. JOB, chap. 19, v. 25, 26, 27. The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. LUKE, chap. 19, v. 10. EPIG. [Here's pretty work! Satan's black bloated Porpus] Here's pretty work! Satan's black bloated Porpus Has dared suspend the Habeas Corpus! But see! one comes—who if I'm not mistaken Will make the Hell-hog scout, to save his bacon! EMBLEM V. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! PSALM 84, v. 1. [Oh love divine! Oh much abounding grace!] I Oh love divine! Oh much abounding grace! To grant a glimpse to one so base Of bliss!—to see and taste this ample store Of love—and paradise explore!— Delightful vision of immortal gifts! Raising the soul to airy clifts, From earthly grovelings!—Lord! I long to part From life—to live in my dear Florist's heart: And adoration pay, A never-ending day, Amidst these fragrant flowers—and constant May! II Like to the Bee—from sweet to sweets I rove Tasting the bounties of thy love— The thornless rose, the odorous violet In perfume speech—say “go not yet.”— The honeysuckle, with mellifluous sweets, Entices to her bow'ry seats— And the white jessamine, with gentle twine Wooes me to tarry, with her tender bine— Oh I would willing stay My lifelong day, Midst flowers that never fade—and constant May. III Fond children of the World! did ye but know The chosen plants that here do grow— Did ye once taste the cooling quenching rills, That trickle from th'ethereal Hills— Did ye once hear the melody that cheers The heart—and fascinates the ears!— Ye would not while with gaudy marigolds, Or drink of thirsty springs that Earth infolds! But quickly haste away To spend a day, Amidst these fragrant flowers—and constant May. IV Ye laud the charms the changing world affords, Its pleasures, honours—golden hoards; And vainly think that wealth well spent May purchase heaven! although not give content. Alas! ye argue, but ye little know, Since reason's clogg'd by things below: Did ye once taste these rills, and hear, and see These heavenly sights—you'd raise your thoughts and flee From earth and things of clay To spend a day, Amidst these fragrant flowers—and constant May. V Your thoughts, poor Worldlings! and the goods ye prize Are worthless in the Bridegroom's eyes: Your birds are tuneless, when compared with these That sing from everlasting trees: The waters ye call fair, and so much praise, Are turbid as your brightest days: To taste you've but to will—and to forego The 'witching World!—is but the World to know. Then prithee haste away To spend a day, Amidst these fragrant flowers—and constant May. That is the true and chief joy, which is not conceived from the creature, but received from the Creator, which being once possest of, none can take from thee: whereto all pleasure being compared is torment, all joy is grief, sweet things are bitter, and all glory is baseness. S. BERNH. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth. MATT., chap. 7, v. 7, 8. Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. JOHN, chap. 6, v. 37. They mind earthly things; but our conversation is in heaven. PHILIP., chap. 3, v. 19. EPIG. [Hark! to the warning voice—it tells thee true] Hark! to the warning voice—it tells thee true, Thy coin is Brummagem—thy pansies, rue! Shake off thy sloth—be wise—nor more deceive Thyself with baubles! which you die, and leave. EMBLEM VI. As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. PROV. 26, v. 11. [Touch it no more, fond Boy!] I Touch it no more, fond Boy! But think thyself well loose From such a load!—employ Thy senses to a better use! For all thy toil, what dost possess of its possessions? Disease! from revel nights—and hollow false professions II Sickness doth sometimes prove A good; and works a change— So thine may mercy move, And thee from earth estrange; Thy ague-stricken limbs, oppressed by mammon weight Have toppled off their load—thy worse than worthless freight. III How thou hast puff'd, and blow'd, And vainly spent thy breath, And stagger'd with thy load, And gasp'd as one in death! Know Boy! thy hot-cold malady is earth begot, And wilt thou strive again, to gain so foul a lot? IV Thou hast escap'd—unhurt— Without a crick—fond Boy! Dost woo again the flirt, The gilded cheating toy? 'Tis full of bubbles, bawbles, snares, and turpitude Give it no more thy love—thy willing servitude. V Hast thou ambition? rise From earth to things above,— To heaven thy downcast eyes, And choose a nobler love— There may'st thou rest from toil—and loads oppressing In realms of joy, 'midst treasures worth possessing. O you that dote upon the world, for what victory do ye fight? Your hopes can be crowned with no greater reward than the world can give; and what is the world but a brittle thing full of dangers, wherein we travel from lesser to greater perils? Oh, let all her vain, light, and momentary glory perish with herself, and let us be conversant with more eternal things. S. AUGUST., lib. Confess. Vanity of vanities; saith the preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity. I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit. ECCL., chap. 1, v. 2, 14. For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? LUKE, chap. 9, v. 25. EPIG. [One paradox the Moth and Man entangles] One paradox the Moth and Man entangles: She burns her legs off—and still seeks the candles: So thoughtless he, bilk'd, cross'd, and wounded, daily teazed; Still wooes the swindling world—as were his brain diseased. EMBLEM VII. To every thing there is an appointed time. ECCLES., chap. 3, v. 1. [Avaunt thy hand!—my days fly so too fast!] Avaunt thy hand!—my days fly so too fast! Just now I've leisure to review the past— Let go the Index! tell me, has fell spite Embued thee?—so to hasten on the night.— The Index, as the horologe, goes well, No hour escapes unmark'd its loud-tongued bell. I have not clogg'd the wheels, or staid its go; But kept them fed with oil, and clean—altho' I've often wish'd the pendulum might stand, Without the aid of my too willing hand. Scythe-man! forbear—the days of my existence Are few enough, without thy sharp assistance! Time. —Thine oil has not been pure!—the wheels are clogg'd— The pendulum's too slow—and must be jogg'd! The works are sore disorder'd—and I trow You've lived too fast—and it goes far too slow! With Thee,—the hour of twelve has long since chimed Yet here—the Index lags at six. Lady. —Ill-timed! Time. —Poor soul! I will but set the Meter right That thou may'st truly know Time's rapid flight! Thy constitution fails—thy death's begun! Thy day is spent before the set of sun! Lady. —How lived too fast?—of what have I partook Not drest by rules of culinary book?— Did I e'er sip but of the costliest wine?— Or e'er on couch less soft than down, recline?— Have I lethargically gone to bed Before the sun decampt—or night was sped?— I ne'er exposed me to the evening's dew, Nor sought the damps of morn—as “cotters” do! In mansion pleasures I have past the night Nor rose—till Sol had gain'd meridian height! Time. —Thine oil has been impure!—thy knowledge frail To think that sloth and lux'ries could avail To foster health—thy system's morbid grown! And hale hilarity—for ever flown: Thy turbid blood flows at a drawling pace, And Apoplexy stalks upon thy face!— My mission's done!—poor soul! I must away To meet the sun—and usher in the day! Lady. —While—yet awhile! Oh, tell me what to do! Time. —Reverse thy life—thy flitted hours review! Div. Cup. —Repent! whilst minutes last—thy hours are few.— Hope still remains—here turn thy flooded eyes, And trust ? time flies! Luxury is an enticing pleasure, a bastard mirth, which hath honey in her mouth, gall in her heart, and a sting in her tail. HUGO. Mind ye how ye pass your hours, for life is the time of your probation—life is uncertain; therefore procrastinate not; what ye think is health ofttimes proves disease, and sickness ofttimes is your health. ANON. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. LUKE, chap. 6, v. 25. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. 1 PETER, chap. 5, v. 8. EPIG. [Tho' fair to view—th'Asphal'tean fruit accurst!] Tho' fair to view—th'Asphal'tean fruit accurst! Is cored with bitterness—and pulp'd with dust! Hectic may heighten beauty—but the ruddy wealth That blooms upon the country cheek—is Health. EMBLEM VIII. You that walk in the light of your own fire; and in the sparks that ye have kindled, ye shall lie down in sorrow. ISAIAH, chap. 50, v. 11. [What dost thou there? Poor Boy, thou hast no chance] I What dost thou there? Poor Boy, thou hast no chance 'Mongst practised gamblers fraught with foul deceit! Thou might'st as well seek piety, perchance, Or bashful virtue in the public street! Thou can'st not hope to win, from such companionment! Unfructive is thy science—and thy time's misspent. II Hast thou much gold to stake? they'll have it all, Maugre thy cunning—Two, so closely leagued As Mammon, and his man—must work thy fall; They are all eye, and touch,—whilst thou fatigued With planning, hoping, watching—nod'st: anon They make thee bankrupt—and thy reputation's gone. III Vain, foolish youth!—to think thy mite of sense Can cope with such—so consummate in wiles!— Thy honest play, poor Boy! is poor pretence— Those are but grins—that thou mistak'st for smiles! Thou hast not half a chance!—t'escape unscath'd their paws Is hopeless—as the captur'd mouse from feline claws. IV A dumbmy! verily they have in tow: Thou see'st not when they filch thee of the deal!— Cut as thou wilt, an honour lies below, But thou no knave canst on the board reveal! Now they revoke! by thee unkenn'd: their spades come in, And all thy hearts are lost: Fool! dost still think to win? V What! four by honours!—and thy score at six! Thy joyful look betides a certainty— Thou art deceived—they'll win the game by tricks! Despite thy honours, and thy chuckling eye. Thou may'st as well attempt to guide the light of day, As pit thy fancied science 'gainst their crafty play. VI Thou hast no chance!—thy winning is in flight! Break up—get home—thou'st rubbers lost enow! How can'st thou in such folly take delight? Marring thy forehead, with a wrinkled brow— Unless thou dost repent, and change thy ways and friends; Thy life will be thy death, and Hell thy journey ends! Avoid disputations; for much evil has been done to Christ's Church by weak disputants—the Logicians of this world do use subtleties—and do oftentimes confound the faithful—yea, sometimes bring into captivity the disciple that doth trust his own strength— Do not seek them out—and if the Children of the Devil would seek thee out—send them to your Doctors. ANON. I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. JOB, chap. 30, v. 30. But shame shall be the promotion of fools. PROV., chap. 3, v. 35. EPIG. ['Tis better keep at home, and ponder well—] 'Tis better keep at home, and ponder well— Than search out casuists, to controvert— His idiosyncracy is great!—who thinks to quell A flaming Play-house—with a penny squirt! EMBLEM IX. Be thou faithful unto death. REV., chap. 2, v. 10. [Return my best belov'd! nor linger longer, where] I Return my best belov'd! nor linger longer, where The nightingale is mute! though silent groves be there! But spread the sails of my desires—thine anchor weigh; For I am mark'd for scorn!—by thy prolonged stay. The Nobles pass me by, with haughty eyes; Nor hear my sighs! The Merchants close their hands, and bar the door 'Gainst my implore! The Maidens toss the head, and will not know, One brought so low! My Kindred fly me—when they should console Mine anguish'd soul! All this I suffer, and much more could bear! Would my Beloved come—if he would draw more near! Blow gently winds—ye balmy zephyrs play Around my Love! whilst my Beloved's away. II Return my best belov'd! nor longer linger, where The nightingale is mute! though spicy woods be there! But hoist the sails of my desires! thine anchor weigh; For I am mark'd for scorn!—by thy protracted stay. They ask me whom I love! but I thy name Fear to proclaim! Lest they should multiply their scoffs and sneers, And mock my tears! They doubt my honour!—thy betroth'd they shun As one undone By traitor!—left to tears, and sobs, and frights, And sleepless nights. All this I suffer, and yet more could bear! Would my Beloved come—if he would draw more near! Blow gently winds—ye fragrant zephyrs play Around my Love—whilst my Beloved's away. III Return my best belov'd! nor linger longer, where The nightingale is mute! though spicy groves be there! But spread the sails of my desires! thine anchor weigh; For scorn I am the “mark!”—from thy prolonged stay. Thou said'st, my Love! thou would'st return full soon: By change of moon! The moon has chang'd, and chang'd, and chang'd again But chang'd in vain! Nor Moon, nor Sun, has solace brought my heart, Since thy depart! But sorrowing days and nights fill up the space, And blear my face. All this I undergo—and more would bear! Did my Beloved come—if he would draw more near! Blow gently winds—ye rose-fraught zephyrs play Around my Love—whilst my Beloved's away. IV Return my best belov'd! nor longer linger, where The nightingale is mute! tho' myrtle groves be there! But hoist the sails of my desires! thine anchor weigh; For scorn I'm made the “mark!”—from thy prolonged stay. I will not breathe, thou might'st be back ere now: By plighted vow! I will not think thee fickle grown, and gone: And I forlorn! Oh no! but hope, with balmy breathing morn Thou wilt return! Fraught with delights, to succour, heal, and charm My fond alarm. Much have I undergone—and more could bear! Did my Beloved come—if he would draw more near! Blow gently winds—ye od'rous zephyrs play Around my Love—whilst my Beloved's away. V Return my best belov'd—nor linger longer, where, The nightingale is mute! tho' citron groves be there! But spread the sails of my desires! thine anchor weigh; For I am stricken sore!—by thy protracted stay. Come my beloved! to my loyal breast, And be at rest! Make it thy haven safe, from rock and billow: Thy peaceful pillow! Be thou my magnet—make the needle true, Quickened by you! Then height, nor depth, nor space shall sever Our love—Oh never! Much have I undergone, and more would bear! Did my Beloved come—if he would draw more near! Blow briskly winds—sweet fanning zephyrs play Around my Love—my lover speeds his way! Fear not, O Bride, nor despair; think not thyself contemned, if thy Bridegroom withdraw his face awhile. AUTOR scalæ paradisi. If the Church hath true love towards Christ, time and absence will but make it more binding—for the Spirit doth sometimes appear to be absent, and the Church suffers persecutions that it may be tried—but the Bridegroom will not tarry long away: therefore be ye faithful to Martyrdom. ANON. Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is lovely. My beloved is mine and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies. CANT., chap. 2, v. 14, 16. By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but found him not. IB., chap. 3, v. 1. EPIG. [The true True-lovers'-knot but firmer ties] The true True-lovers'-knot but firmer ties The farther lovers part—hold thou but fast— Tho' still earth-bound—thy Love beyond the skies! The tie contracts—the union's sure to last. EMBLEM X. My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments. PSALM 119, v. 120. [How could I trust yon antic swain] I How could I trust yon antic swain With cap and bells and toy? Some planet, sure, did turn my brain To catch at such decoy: With him to keep fools' holiday I gambol'd far away— I followed where he led—he led astray— II Thoughtless we pass'd Mount Sinai: Loud thunderings smote my ear: Fork'd lightnings glared my wanton eye, But life was in the glare! I took alarm—on feet of thought Jordan's pure stream I sought; I found a sterile country—parch'd with drought! III I turn'd my steps to Bethsaida, But found no waters fair— No “pool!” no Ishmaelitish trader Halted his camels there. I fled—my antic snare pursued And would again have woo'd— I stopt my ears—and all his lures withstood. IV I sought Bethesda's fount of fame, But found its waters “still.” I watch'd—no friendly angel came To agitate the rill— Distracted o'er the earth I roam— I've dared the Ocean's foam! Do tell me—if thou canst—my pathway home! V Oh I am weary, sick, and sad, My half-clad limbs are cold; No good I've known—no peace have had, Since I forsook the fold: But thorny paths, and flinty roads, And chilly damp abodes: And worse than all—dismal and dire forebodes! Evangelist. —The Prodigal! repentant grown, Was welcomed with cost— Thy gentle Shepherd knows his own, Altho' the mark be lost! He left the “perfect ninety-nine!” I'th' fold, and did incline To seek the “truant one,” with love divine! Soul. —Say! is there hope, when I return, To 'scape the righteous dart? Evangelist. —Yes! if his love did ever burn Within thy wayward heart. This pathway leads to yonder gate, There loudly knock—though late— Thy Shepherd stands prepar'd to fold the runagate! Broad and spacious is the road to infernal life: there are enticements and death-bringing pleasures— there the Devil flattereth that he may deceive: smileth that he may endamage: allureth that he may destroy. CYPRIAN, in Ep. The Lord went before the children of Israel by day in a pillar of cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire, but they rebelled—the thunderings of Mount Sinai affrighted them: yet they bow'd to Idols—he gave them bitter water to drink—he also gave them manna to eat—but for all his anger and kindnesses they repented not—so that of the host that fled from Egypt, none entered the promised land save Joshua and Caleb. ANON. Return ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. JEREMIAH, chap. 3, v. 22. I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins; return unto me, for I have redeemed thee. ISAIAH, chap. 44, v. 22. Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. MATT., chap. 11, v. 28. EPIG. [To be well off—and feel so! sure is knowledge] To be well off—and feel so! sure is knowledge, To keep so—wisdom! seldom gain'd at College: Sound health requires but little care—much care To reinstate—and boxes of—Pilula fare. EMBLEM XI. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. GENESIS, chap. 1, v. 3. [In vain thou striv'st, the Power that made, can rule] I. In vain thou striv'st, the Power that made, can rule, Can move, can fix—can delegate—resume— The malign influence of thyself, and fool, No more shall mar the world or thought entomb— Behold! religion, peace, and science fair, Now reign where ignorance and superstition, Avarice and folly had a share Of sway—and hurried to perdition. Thou fail'st to move—yet hop'st to bear away The wanton World—and once more so regain Thy power to work—if only for a day— I tell thee Mammon! that thy hope is vain! The hold thou hast—too slight to bear—will break, And greater purchase thou'rt forbid to take. II. Dost thou not marvel that thy dainty master, Satan! unheeds thy call—nor sends a devil To help thee stem and strive in thy disaster? To use his favourite thus is far from civil. Perchance! he's ill-at-ease and cannot come, Or paying visits to his debtors? Or is arrived the dread Millennium? And he got fast in mighty fetters: Where for a thousand years, Hell's Majesty In moody melancholy may solus sit; Or rave and curse, or contemplate and sigh, Within the confines of the groundless pit! 'Tis even so!—some work is left for thee— But all thy power to tempt shall harmless be: Thou still the thousand years shalt play a part, But lack the sway thou once hadst o'er the heart. By how much nearer Satan perceiveth the World to be at an end, by so much the more fiercely he troubleth it with persecution; that knowing himself to be damned he may get company in his damnation. ISIDOR., lib. 1. Then shall Christ's kingdom be manifest, for it is written that Satan shall be bound for a thousand years, which is called the Millennium; and then after a time shall Christ reign. ANON. All vices wax old by age: covetousness alone groweth young. S. AUGUST. And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the Dragon, that old serpent which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit. REV. chap. 20, v. 1, 2, 3. And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it. IBIDEM, chap. 20, v. 11. EPIG. [The motto “mutatur non mutari”] The motto “mutatur non mutari” Seems to have put Mammon in a quandary; As the writing of old, displayed on the wall Staggered Belshazzar before his fall— Old tempter to evil, thou may'st fret, fume, and fuss, For thy doom, likes the doom, of old Sisyphus! EMBLEM XII. FIRST PART. Lighten mine eyes, O Lord, lest I sleep the sleep of death. PSALM 13, v. 3. [To tread] I To tread Where sleep the dead; To muse upon the past, Is life to know, whilst life does last. The flow'r that blooms upon the conic sod Exhaling fragrant sweets—emblems a soul with God! II Where lie The great that die? I'th' earth!—and their abode Is with the slave that bore the load! Death knows not of degrees—he equal makes The clown, the priest, the monarch! when their breath he takes. III The dead O'er whom we tread: But few years past trod o'er The church-yard—and are now no more: Silent and dank they rest—the boist'rous world, With all its storms, affrights them not—their sails are furl'd. IV To muse, And to diffuse Our musings 'mongst the young, Ready to join the busy throng, Of men—is what Experience owes to Youth: Let them beware of slighting wisdom and reproof! V Upon A plank we run, Across a gulph that yawns— Life's path is thick beset with thorns! It is a meadow all bestrew'd with flowers! It is a stormy sea!—a day of gentle showers! VI The past! The thought how vast— Epoch on Epoch, have evolv'd! Yet “the first cause” is still unsolv'd; The problem's, not for man's infirmity Of mind—we cannot comprehend “eternity!” O Wisdom! with how sweet an art doth thy wine and oil restore health to my healthless soul! how powerfully merciful, how mercifully powerful art thou! powerful for me, merciful to me! S. GREG., in pastoral. The Church-yard is a delightful garden, and the Charnel-house a mansion of sweet savour to the enquiring soul; for they lead to meditation on the fragileness and noisomeness of this corruptible, and the necessary preparation for the incorruptible state. ANON. But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God. PSALM 73, v. 28. EPIG. [The Tombstone “records” of the village dead] The Tombstone “records” of the village dead Invite the passer-by to—“stop and read!” O Reader! read and stop—behold thy bed Of earth! whate'er thy rank—whate'er thy creed. SECOND PART. Yet a little while is the light with you. JOHN, chap. 12, v. 35. [Is life] VII Is life A long short strife, And nothing more?—it ought To be, the nursery of thought— The time allotted to prepare our souls With true and “vise” passports! good at heavenly tolls! VIII To know, Where lurks the foe And what his strength, is half The battle—with thy pilgrim staff, If Pilgrim true thou art—thou may'st assault The tempting fiend—and haply bring him to default! IX Before The conflict sore: Let Hope, thy thews encase: And Faith, thy holy courage brace; Be Love, thy trust—which if vouchsaf'd, thou'rt sure To foil the tempter—and the promised prize secure. X 'Tis gone! “The bell strikes one!” The myst'ry's solv'd—in youth Be wise—and know this solemn truth! Life is the time to seek the Lord—in death There's no “repent”—Hope flits upon the parting breath! XI And all Our own we call; We leave—the wise-laid plan For eking out our little span Of life, in deeds of worth and piety, Put off—undone—Death tears us from society. XII O'ercast— The sunshine past— The cold earth intervenes Between the actor, and life-scenes! This ponderous Globe shall disappear! Death die! Time lose his 'count!—bewildered in Eternity! Thou knowest not what time he will come; wait always, that because thou knowest not the time of his coming, thou mayst be prepared against the time he cometh. S. AUGUST. Despise ye the mammon of this world—be ye temperate and humble—vigilant—valiant for the faith and persevering to the end; so shall ye inherit the Crown of Glory. ANON. Neither be ye terrified because of them. For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. DEUT., chap. 20, v. 3, 4. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities. EPH., chap. 6, v. 12. The world passeth away, and the lust thereof. 1 JOHN, chap. 2, v. 17. EPIG. [Man, prates about his love of peace, and hate of strife—] Man, prates about his love of peace, and hate of strife— The certainty of Death—th'uncertainty of Life— Yet does his little life, less love than strife contain; And Life, and Death, preach holy certainties in vain. [ALAS!] ALAS! We sob and cry Most piteously, In early INFANCY! Our CHILDHOOD years move trippingly: Our BOYHOOD and our lectures crawlingly— And then we wish for power and manhood ardently— We love &amp; hate, &amp; hope &amp; fear—gain, lose; are hale &amp; sick alternately! Passes MANHOOD—then comes on OLD AGE &amp; feebleness; &amp; then we sigh The time that's past,—and think it all mispent—are very worldly wise—and DIE! [illeg.]ing our little “good or ill” to that world's whim to blot or magnify: And then our friends, with ostentation, send the body to the grave—in earth to lie: And kindred weep, 'kerchief in hand—and put on black, to mistify: And say they share our gold reluctantly, Thinking the time arrived full tardily! And then they live right merrily Laughing, and cheerily Forgetting verily OLD SLY! This World's a Circus—Hospital, a Paradise, a Sty! In which we strive, and moan, and riot, multiply and die. LIFE's but a span—a sob, a smile, a laugh, a sigh; And ah! 'tis made well nigh A very, very FARCE!</field>
