      <field name="fulltext">TO THE SACRED MAIESTIE OF MY DREAD SOVERAIGNE LORD THE KING. See (gratious Liege) from Sabrines farthest shore, (The semicircling bound of that dominion, Where hardy Britaines your great name adore) A Shepherd lowly in his owne opinion, Bold on your Grace, presents you with a Song, Whose subiect rightly doth to you belong. A Theame diuine, though simple be the Singer: A feast of dainties, in a woodden platter: As you esteeme the Cates, accept the Bringer: Deeme of the Person, as you like the matter. The Swaine could not find out a fitter thing, To shew his faith, and zeale vnto his King. 'Twas in the Presse, liuing your Royall Sire, Saluting you with Title of The Prince: But sith the King of Kings hath rays'd you higher, The Frontispice is onely altred since. The Booke each-where its former style obserues, And humbly begs your pardon where it swerues. Vouchsafe it shelter vnder Your protection. It guides the Reader to eternall rest, Directs Inferiors to their due subjection, Stor'd with instructions vsefull for the best. May Kings and Princes from your loynes descending: Reade it with comfort to the worlds ending. Your Sacred Maiesties most humble, and faithfull Subiect: Iohn Stradling. To the Reuerend Father in God, Theophilvs, Lord Bishop of Landaffe, my worthy Diocesan. Sent with the Copie, to be pervsed. Loe, here a Childe of mine in Sacred Font Alreadie dipt, repayres for Confirmation To you (my Lord) reflect your eye vpon't, I'm suertie for his Christian education. Then on his Head impose your hand, and blesse, If you approue the Faith he doth confesse. Your Lordships very louing friend, Ioh. Stradling. The Lord Bishops answere. I view'd your Childe, and I dare sweare 'tis yours, So plaine so pithy, and so like the Sire: The Theame diuine, commends your well-spont how'rs, The Poets furie, and the Fathers fire. I poz'd him in our vulgar Catechisme, And thus Confirme him, he is void of schisme. Your true louing friend, THEO. LANDAVENSIS. Another of the same Lord Bishop. This booke's a Sustæme Theologicall, A Paraphrase vpon the holy Bible: I wish, who stand vpon their Gentrie, all Such Poets were; instructed thus to scribble. No man could write the Theorie so well, Who did not in the Practick part excell. Theo. Landaven. DIVINE POEMS. The first Classis. THE ARGVMENT. Messias Promised, Figured, Prophecied. The Theame propos'd, the heau'nly ayde implor'd: Mans fall. Messias of the Womans seede Promis't, by whom Mankinde should bee restor'd, To Patriarks renewed oft, here reade. Types, Sacrifices, Figures shew the same, Prophets describe his Person, Birth, and Name. 1 A Mayden-Mother, and a King her sonne, The subiect of this work. Excite my Muse a taske to vnder-take: The like hath not beene since the world begunne. My spirits faile, my feeble hand doth shake, My heart, with highnesse of the theame doth tremble: The true-heart-searcher knowes I nought dissemble. 2 O thou the Source, and Subiect of my song, Inuocation for diuine ayde. That canst make Babes thy prayses to rehearse: Illuminate my minde, vntie my tongue, That I may see aright, and sing in Verse, Thy high Discent, thy Birth, thy Generation, Life, Doctrine, Deeds, Death, strange Resussitation. 3 That seeing, singing, I may meditate On th' Worlds new-birth, lost-mans regeneration: That, what my Muse shall in rude Rimes relate, May sweetly worke in many, soule-saluation. (For, who here reades, beleeues, and liues thereafter, Is Gods deare childe beloued, sonne or daughter.) 4 Gen. 2.When God plac't Man i'th' Garden of delight, And made him Lord of all things vnder skie: He gaue him one precept to keepe aright, With threat, that for transgressing he should die. Adam his sinne and fall,Man sinning had his doome, depriu'd of blisse: A curse laid on the earth, himselfe, and his. 5 First, amplified by the excellency of his creation.Had he beene shap't after an vgly fashion, Or made a Mome of meane capacitie. Or shut vp in some simple habitation, Or fram'd the subiect of infirmitie: Or destin'd to some drudging occupation, So as he might haue loathed his creation: 6 Some colour had beene to excuse the crime, And mitigate the rigour of his doome: But he, of all earth-creatures had the prime, Sate Ruler of the rest, as in Gods roome: Gen. 1. 26.Endew'd with reason, speech, and comely feature, After Gods Image, a most noble Creature. 7 Elen his dwelling, daintie fruits his feeding, Health, beautie, strength, not subiect to decay: He needed not to toyle, nor sweat for's breeding, But thinke vpon his God, thanke him, and pray. Old age, diseases, death could not haue harm'd him, Had he obey'd his Maker who fore-warn'd him. 8 Secondly, by the facilitie to haue obserued the Precept.Nor was the Precept so precise to hold, (One Tree among some thousands to forbeare.) But that the retchlesse creature was so bold, His wife to follow, more then God to feare. Sure, to the Deuill he would not haue yeilded, Gen. 3. 12.But by the Woman, simply was beguiled. 9 That knew the subtile Serpent, who began To tempt the weake, and likeliest to be wonne: He made no offer to seduce the Man, But gayning her, he thought the matter done. By Adams fall, each man is taught a Lecture: I say no more, but leaue it to coniecture. 10 How long he dwelt within this pleasant seate, Questions vnanswered. Whether some yeeres, or moneths, or dayes, or lesse: Ere he of that forbidden fruit did eate, Presum'd his Makers precept to transgresse: Are questions I'll not venter to decide. Long in the place it's like he did not bide. 11 “For why? The Deuill certes soone began “To play his prize; he vseth not to sleepe, “But watcheth euer to beguile that man, “Whom God and his good Angels doth not keepe. “No sooner did this Fowler set his gin, “But Adam, like a silly fowle, flew in. 12 If he, a creature of such rare perfection, Such depth of reason, wisedome and foresight, Who had to good and ill like free election, Who knew precisely what was wrong, what right: If such a Man, so Angell-like as hee, At first assault could yeild, and conquer'd bee. 13 What may be hop't for in his wretched race, Infected with the venom of his sinne: Made foes to God, depriued of his grace, And much more apt to let temptation in? How may we shun that subtill Serpents baites, Who to beguile vs, all occasions waites? 14 A Comparison.A subiect tainted with such shamefull treason, Against his souereigne Lord to him most kinde: To hope for pardon, certes hath small reason, To sue for it, how durst he cast in's minde? What he might blush to begge, God freely gaue: Enfranchis'd him, who made himselfe a slaue. 15 Gods infinite goodnesse to Angels, and Men.In God, a mirror full of admiration, Neuer enough admired we behold: To Man and Angels in their first creation, Such boundlesse bountie as cannot be told: Diuinitie excepted, nothing wanted: In other Princely gifts they were not scanted. 16 These, wayting alwayes in his heauenly Palace, Blest with his presence: (Blessing there's no greater,) That, in earths pleasant Garden taking solace, Sole Lord and King ouer each other creature. What would? Nay more what could they haue expected? Ingratefull, that so good a God neglected. 17 Lastly, by the obedience of inferior creatures, mans rebellion is aggrauatedAll creatures else obseru'd their Makers Lawe, Aym'd at those ends, whereto he had assign'd them: To breake his Hests, it seemes they stood in awe, Nature, not Reason, was the bond did binde them. “Angels and Man, that most should haue obay'd: “Were onely they, who from their dutie stray'd. 18 First Lucifer presumed to rebell, And drew with him whole millions to conspire: These hurled downe into the pit of hell, Enrag'd with enuie, malice, wrath and ire, Persisted and proceeded in their sinne, Striuing more rebels on their side to winne. 19 It grieu'd the wretch, to see Mans happy state, Tormented was he at his blest condition: This mou'd him more, both God and Man to hate, For holding that, whereof he lost fruition. Fayling 'gainst God, The Man he then assayl'd, Nor left him, till against him he preuayl'd. 20 Oft haue I heard it by my Elders told, A Simile. And noted for a thing most certaine true: That men, whom plague or pestilence doth hold, The stronger on them that infection grewe: The more they wish occasions to embrace, For drawing others to their desp'rate case. 21 So fares it with that wicked damned Fiend, Plagu'd with the rancour of his foule offence: He walkes, and hunts about eu'n to this end, By might, or craft, or any faire pretence, To leade mankinde into his curs't condition, And bring both soule and body to perdition. 22 He wrought with Adam iust as he desir'd, The Deuill a most wilfull Rebel to God, vnpardonable. Made him accurst, and cheated of Gods grace, Like to himselfe: (for-cause he once aspir'd, Arch-traytor, to mount seated in Gods place.) Through willfull pride he fell, can rise no more: Man simply misse-lead, found fauour. For Man misse-lead, God kept a boone in store. 23 So haue I often read, seene and obserued, A Comparison. Gods Vice-royes deale with Rebells of each kinde: Ring-leaders dragg'd to death, as they deserued, When simple soules seduced, fauour finde. “Mercy and Iustice ought be ioyn'd together, “Kings that haue one alone, as liefe th' had neither. 24 Iude 6.Gods Iustice seized on those sinning spirits, That left their first estate, to clamber higher: They were rewarded after their demerits, Doom'd to the vengeance of eternall fire. Hence comes that prouerbe, daily vs'd by all, (Most certaine is it) Pride will haue a fall. 25 Gen. 3. 12, 13. Adam likewise and Eue (poore soules) were cited At Iustice-barre, to answere their offence: Each of them pleaded, how they were enticed, And so confest, vsing no more defence. Iudgment they had (Gods Iustice could no lesse) But Mercy found a meane for their redresse. 26 A worldly-wise Obiection, or Cauill.A wordly-minded-wizard here will looke, To know what motiue mou'd the King of heauen, That he lost-man into his fauour tooke, Who of his grace himselfe had cleane bereauen. Belike, God of his seruice should haue neede, Or Man might after stand his God in steede: 27 Or for some future good in him fore-seene, Or else for lacke of Seruitors beside: Or, 'cause his fault might a sleight error seeme, Not done of malice, stubbornnesse, or pride. Such poore excuses some perhaps might fayne, Meere phantasies bred in their idle brayne. 28 Answere. Psal. 16. 2.Fond Fooles, who harbour such a grosse conceit, That Man should render God due retribution: The matter (doubtlesse) is of greater weight, Our goodnesse all, to him is but pollution. The crime was treason 'gainst great heauens-King, The streames of mercy from himselfe must spring. 29 Of speciall grace, and from Gods owne meere motion, Degratia speciali, &amp; mero metu: wordes ordinarie with Princes in Pardons, and Patents of grace The Pardon did proceede. So vse great Kings, When Pardons they bestowe. They'll take no notion Of merit, gift, reward, or such like things. If earth-gods deale so with such as offends them, Much more the God of Gods, who that pow'r lends them. 30 It's worth the noting to obserue the way, How that Great Iudge to sentence doth proceede: Messias promised. Gen. 3. 15. The Serpent sentenced without more stay, He made the promise to the Womans seede: And blest her in the very circumstance Of that, whereby he meant t'enioyne her penance. 31 Her punishment, first sorrowes in her childing: Then, to the Man obedience and subiection: The blessing on her birth (more comfort yeilding) Io. 16. 21. Might well weigh downe a greater malediction. Thus, of the first, God eas'd her: from the next, Most women free themselues. (That's not i'th' Text.) 32 Now was the Man out of the Garden sent, To till the ground, and labour for his liuing: His time in idlenesse might not be spent, Bread had he none, but what he got by striuing In sweat and sorrow: Herbs the field gaue store, Such pittance was allow'd him, and no more. 33 Adam liu'd long, saw many Generations, By him his sonnes were taught their Maker knowe: They grew apace, began to furnish Nations, Yet most of them, to worship God were slowe. Of godly men there waxt so great a dearth, As onely one was found on the whole earth. 34 Noah. Pet. 2. Gen. 6. 18. Noah, of righteousnesse a blessed Preacher, To him and his, Gods Couenant was made good: The Lord himselfe vouchsaf't to be his Teacher, And warning him aforehand of the Flood, He built the Arke, preseru'd his Familie, And stor'd the Earth with his posteritie. 35 Noahs Arke. 1. Pet. 3. 21.That Arke betokened right our Christian Font, Where faithfull soules neere readie to be drown'd, In sinnes-huge-swelling Sea of Negropont, Cleane washt from filth, are saued to be crown'd. With blessed Noah and his companie, To liue and reigne as Kings eternally. 36 Gen 1. 28. and 9. 1. 2.To him the blessing which he first bestow'd, On Adam and his wife at their creation, God once againe renew'd: it further flow'd, More choise of foode was 'llow'd for sustentation. Now Fish, and Fowle, and beasts-flesh they might eate, Whereas before, greene herbes was all their meate. 37 Yet God, to shew how much he did detest, The cursed sinne of bloudie crueltie: Vers. 4.Forbade to eate the bloud of any beast. So, to restraine them from all gluttonie, The fat (no more then bloud) might not be eaten, Both sorts with sharpe correction he doth threaten. 38 Noah dyed full of yeeres, left issue store, Few of them all (it seemes) were like their father: Gen. 11.They snuft, and swore, We will be drown'd no more, Wee'll build a Tower vp to Heauen rather. They set vpon the worke, yet in conclusion, Babel.That building turned to their owne confusion. 39 Thus some went East, some West, some North and South, Searching new Countries yet to them vnknowne: A diff'rent tongue was neere in each mans mouth, Hardly they knew strange children from their owne. “'Gainst God there's no contending: The best way “Is first to know his will, and then obay. 40 I wonder often casting in my minde, Gods gifts and graces powred downe on men, His threats and plagues withall! how they wax blinde, And (pard'ned oft) transgresse the more agen. “Him whom nor stripes, nor gifts, can fright or gaine, “All hope of such a gracelesse childe is vaine. 41 Among the sonnes of Noah, few were found, (Much like blacke Swannes) that walked in his way: They neither fear'd Gods iudgments when he frown'd, Nor for his gentle Promises car'd they: As if there had beene neither Hell, nor Heauen, Aduent'ring soule and all on sixe and seauen. 42 Like Birds for whom the Fowler spreads his net, A Simile. And traynes them in with whistle, and a stale: Or fish, when bayted hookes old Anglers set, Which bitten, brings them soone vnto their bale. So that old-Angler-for-mens-soules, some wynnes With sweetned baytes, and some with subtle gynnes. 43 Though Shem were most religious of the rest, Shem. And Gods true worship to his children left: Yet in few after-ages, eu'n the best Fell backe, and of that blisse themselues bereft. Ios. 24. 2. Yea Terah, father of Gods faithfull friend, From the true God, to false his heart did lend. 44 The Promise of the Messias renewed to Abraham. Gen. 12. 3. and 22. 17.To Abraham God shew'd himselfe more plaine, Reclaym'd him from the Land where long he dwelt: The Promise to him he renew'd againe, Such fauour none before him euer felt. Their foe-mens gate b'his seede should be possessed, And in his Seede, all Nations on earth blessed. 45 What of our Grandame Eue in Paradise, More darkely had beene spoken long before: The same to Abr'ham twice at least, or thrice Was said, and God himselfe vnto it swore. Heb. 16.That such as of the Promise should be Heires, Might rest most sure, without feares or dispaires. 46 The promise thus to Abraham made good, His faith was strong, not spic't with vnbeliefe: All points (perhaps) not fully vnderstood, He was resolu'd, and setled in the chiefe. To God he moan'd, for wanting of a sonne, T'accomplish that which he knew would be done. 47 A defence of Abrahams doubts, moued to God touching the promise made to his Seede. Gen. 15. 2. Rom. 4. 19. 20.It seemes, he fear'd his Steward should succeede, Enioy both goods and lands which he possest: Such doubts by him obiected we doe reade, But, by a sound Interpreter exprest, We learne the question grew not of distrust: For why? he knew God in his Word was iust. 48 Else Abrahams faith had not beene so commended, Nor he the Father of all faithfull nam'd: Rather his doubting had beene reprehended, Himselfe for such mistrusting rightly blam'd. His often prayses pleade his innocence, The question mou'd, admits a faire defence. 49 Belike he could not well discerne the way, Of working that which passed reasons reach, By quest'ning with his God he might assay, Whether his Lord, that lesson would him teach. Thus much God told him, he thy Heire shall bee, Gen. 15. 4. Who from thy bowells drawes his pedigree. 50 Sara (good Ladie) shee began deuise, To helpe the matter by her policie: Her daughters in this age are more precise, At least wise they like not such charitie. Thus the old man by Hagar had a boy, For him he pray'd, in him he tooke much ioy. Gen. 17 11. 51 This issue got, he dreamt not of another, Thought him the Lad should breede the world its blisse: Sara he knew too old to be a mother, Yet soone was taught, how he conceau'd amisse. From her (said God) Nations and Kings shall spring: He worshipped, and smil'd to heare the thing. Vers. 17. 52 So did his wife, a graue, and modest Dame, Gen. 18. 22. When that strange newes first sounded in her eare: Shee stept aside, and hid her selfe for shame, To thinke at ninetie shee a childe should beare. (Elizabeth did likewise long time after, Luk. 1. 24. To shew her selfe that shee was Saraes daughter.) 53 The liuely branch, sprung from this wither'd tree: Resemblance in the birth of Isaak, and Christ. Messias birth, by one a Virgin pure: These twaine may rightly paralelled bee, As was that first, so was this later sure. “The one made way, for credence to the other: “Both ioyntly serue, foule vnbeliefe to smother. 54 Gen. 18. 14.All men who credit giue to the Creation, And know, that no thing is for God too hard: Ought wonder lesse at this strange Generation, Nor should their faith be at such promise scar'd. Whether is easier, make a thing of nought? Or out of old, cause that a new be wrought? 55 Now 'mong Gods people grew this matter rife, Isa'k once borne, and Abrahams faith made strong: Gen. 18. 19.He taught his houshold all their true beliefe, To hide this point from them, had beene great wrong: “Faith in the promis'd Seede being th' onely way, “Which leades to Heauen, all that goe astray. 56 Gen. 21. 6.At Isa'ks birth his mother laught apace, Reioyc't to thinke her friends would doe likewise: Gen. 18. 12.(I read shee laught once in another place, But that was fayn'd, after a froward guise.) Well might shee laugh, and sing for such a boy, From whom was to proceede the worlds true ioy. 57 Gen. 21.Of Ismael yet Sara stood in doubt, Sith Abr'ham to that childe great fauour bare: Shee rested not, till shee had cast him out, Lest with her sonne, he should the blessing share. “The mothers Blessing, Heritage, and Lordship, “Long since (as now) could brooke no fellowship. 58 Soone was shee eased of her womans-feare, For, where before the promise ranne at large, To Abraham and his seede: henceforth each-where Gen. 21. 12.To Isa'k God assign'd that heritage. Gen. 24. 36. and 25. 5.Some gifts he gaue, by hand, among the rest: Then left to Isa'k all, as to the blest. 59 The bond-borne-broode is styled Abrahams sonne, Though dis-esteem'd compared with the other: God named Isa'k (thrice) the onely sonne, Gen. 22. 2. 12. 16. When Ishmael liu'd, by birth the elder brother. He blest them much alike in temp'ralties, Reseru'd for one th' heauenly prerogatiues. 60 Looke how a Father nurt'reth vp his childe, A Comparison. Whom best he loues: to breede in him more grace, To make him humble, lowly, meeke, and milde, At all times shewes him not a cheerfull face: But sometimes checks him, sometimes giues a frowne, Thereby from hatefull pride to keepe him downe: 61 So God with blessed Abraham did deale, His best beloued sonne, and faithfull friend: He would not all his minde at first reueale, Nor straight-way bring his promise to an end. “Long looked for, more welcome when it came, “His faiths assurance still encreast his fame. 62 Yet once againe heauens-King, and earths great Lord, Abrahams faith and loue to God, proued. Gen. 22. Saith thus: My seruant Abrahams faith I'll proue: He worships me, by him I am ador'd, I must trie-out th' assurance of his loue. Giue me (saith God) thy sonne in sacrifice, Isa'k, that sonne so precious in thine eyes. 63 This was indeed a triall to the quick, A feat whereby sound friendship should be knowne: It would haue made the strongest heart halfe sick, To spill the bloud, much dearer then his owne. Excuses faire, and many might he fayne, If not t'auoid it quite, yet time to gayne. 64 Amplified by the readinesse of his obedience.My God, this is the childe by thee assign'd, To bring thy faithfull promise to effect: How can I be so rash, or so vnkind, By killing him, to see that promise checkt? Giue me some time to pawse vpon the matter, There is no haste, it may be done hereafter. 65 If not by prayer, or by long perswasion, A pardon for his life may be obtayn'd: (As once I got for Sodom, wicked Nation, Had ten beene found from filthy lust vnstayn'd.) Be't so, when I perceaue no remedie, Thy will shall be fulfill'd, the Lad shall die. 66 Matth. 16. 23.(And did not once our Lords Apostle prime, Disswade his Master, neere in such a case? 'Twas kindnesse to his Lord that moued him, Yet Christ rebuk't him sharply to his face. “(There's no thing wherewith God is better payd, “Then when his will is readily obey'd.) 67 Th' Arch-Patriarke vs'd no such glozing tricke, His heart vnto his God was firmely knit: Gen. 22. 3.Earely next mor'n he rose, bestirr'd him quicke, And for performance gets all that was fit. Fire, wood, and knife he tooke, with full intent To execute the deed, 'bout which he went. 68 Abrah?s shrift to Isaak. See Ios. de Antiq. Iud. lib. 1. cap. 14.'Twere sinne to thinke, that good and holy man Ran rudely to the worke without some stay: We must conceaue, he told to Isaak than, What mou'd him so to doe; taught him to pray, And yeild himselfe to Gods good will and pleasure. Some such short shrift he vs'd, as seru'd his leasure. 69 His sonne then bound, and on the Altar laid, Meeke as a Lambe, prepar'd himselfe to die: The knife tane vp in hand, he neuer staid Till God from heauen stopt him with a crie. God tooke that thing as done, which was intended, A Ramme did serue the turne, and so it ended. 70 Now this good Father saw his glasse neere runne, He prouides for his sonnes marriage. And taking care of his Posteritie: Bethought him of a marriage for his Sonne, Willing to see him setled ere he die: A Cananitish woman he would none, Gen. 24. 3. But needes must haue some cousin of his owne. 71 This bus'nesse of much weight, he recommended To one, who seru'd him with fidelitie: The God of heauen so the man befriended, As he perform'd it with dexteritie. The storie merits often to be read, To marke how God that Messenger did lead. 72 These labours all, and trialls ouer-past, Messias dayes he ioyfully did see: Iob. 8. 56. Then ripe in age, taking his leaue at last, Exchang'd this life for immortalitie. The best of all that euer liu'd before, And such like after him I finde no more. 73 “A godly Father (commonly 'tis seene) “By nurture leaues a gracious sonne behinde: “Where men vnto their God haue faithfull beene, “Their children seldom-while goe out of kinde. As Isa'k stept into his fathers state, So in Gods fauour, like to him, he sate. 74 A Comparison.Kings that grant Charters to their Seruitors, Or to some Townes, of fauour or desart: Though they appoint the sonnes Inheritors, And name Successors therein to haue part: Yet often-times those Charters are renew'd, Some-whiles with wordes, of farther grace endew'd. 75 That Magna Charta of Gods promise, renewed to Isaak Gen. 26. 4That Great-Free-Charter which the King of Kings, Bestow'd on Abr'ham, and his Heires for euer: Confirm'd to Isaak of new he brings, (His mercy to his Chosen fayleth neuer.) To proue, that in his promise he is iust, And free vs from all doubt, or sad distrust. 76 “Yet God, of whom all men should stand in awe, “Who owes to no man ought, but of meere grace: “Not bound to any rules of Common Lawe, “Nor ty'de to Person, Countrie, Time, or Place: Ier. 18. and Rom. 9. 21.Hath pow'r on men, as Potters haue on clay, Doth leaue, and take whom likes him. So he may. 77 Gen. 25. Esau, first borne: he was a man of might, A cunning Hunter, vsed to the field, The chiefe and worthiest in his fathers sight, Knew well his bowe, and weapons how to weild: Nimrod. Gen. 10. 8.Like that great sonne of Cush, who first began With hunting Beast, then after hunted Man. 78 Gen. 25. 27. Iacob was plaine, and of demeanor milde, Not ranging much abroad, but kept his Tent: By nature meeke, and gentle as a childe, His time in frugall exercises spent. To him God did assigne prioritie, Eu'n in the wombe, before natiuitie. 79 As God decreed, all was by meanes effected, His birth-right Esau sleights, and sells for pottage: Gen. 25. 31. A man profane, not fit to be respected, Heb. 12. 16. That lou'd his belly more then's heritage. What Naboths fathers left him by discent, 1. King. 21. To sell, or change, against his heart it went. 80 “And are not now some Esaues to be found, “Who to fill bellies, and bedeck their backs, “Sell ancient houses, implements, and ground “For belly-cheere, and idle apish knacks? “Then Esau-like, turne home by Weeping crosse, “And crie, Ill fortune caused all their losse. 81 When painefull Iacobs by their industrie, Reare vp a house, where they had none before: “God giues his blessing to frugalitie, “And brings a little, soone to ten times more. “It seldome failes but that a good mans paynes, “Is quit in th' end with credit, and with gaynes. 82 Iacob sate neerest in his mothers brest, Gen. 25. 28. Shee kept in minde what God to her fore-told: Assur'd shee was that Iacob should be blest, This made her on his part to be more bold. By her aduise, the blessing he did gayne, Which Esau weeping begg'd, but all in vayne. Heb. 12. 17. 83 When to her sonne, the matter first shee brake, Gen. 27. 6. Aduising him t'aduenture on the plot, Declares what Isa'k erst to Esau spake, Who with his bowe went forth to seeke a shot: He fear'd by such a trick to speede the worse, And draw vpon himselfe his fathers curse. 84 Be bold (my sonne) feare not at all, quoth shee, I'll take thy curse, so thou my voyce obay: Goe quickly to the flock, bee rul'd by mee. He yeilds to her, and makes no longer stay, Two Kids he brought, wherewith shee made a messe, Which Isa'k eating, did the Bringer blesse. 85 Thus, in the person of his elder brother, (The storie ought precisely to be noted.) By listning to the counsaile of his mother, Like Esau, skinn'd: And with his garments, coated: This yonger sonne, obtayn'd the elders blessing. Wherein I plainely reade a double Lesson. 86 To Mother-Church, her Children should giue eare, In things which God instructs her must be done: Our elder brothers rayment we must weare, By no meanes else Gods blessing can be won. To Christ our Lord, this hath a full relation, Whose Iustice cloathing vs, we gayne saluation. 87 A Simile.A boy that once hath waded ouer shooes, And for his fault hath had a check, or threat: Runs further in, cares not how deepe he goes, Sith once for all, he knowes he shall be beat. Esau proceedeth hauing ill begonne, And shewes himselfe a more vntoward sonne. 88 Gen. 26. 34.He weds with Gentiles 'gainst his parents will, It grieu'd them both vnto the very heart: Gen. 27 41.Then makes a vow, he would his brother kill, But wise Rebecca shunn'd it with her art. “It's good for sonnes, t'haue mothers on their side: “Few Families where that's not verifi'de. 89 The Sacred Storie leades me next to sing, Of Iacobs iourney to a forrein Land: His parents both were carefull of one thing, Gen. 27. 46. and 28. 1. And strictly laid vpon him this command: A Cananitish wife thou shalt not wed, Isaaks charge to his sonne Iacob. Nor take a Heathen-fellow to thy bed. 90 (Such matches long agone procur'd the Flood.) Gen. 6. 2. Goe seeke a Mate among thy Mothers kin: God make thee fruitfull, blesse, and doe thee good. His iourney thereupon he did begin, Poore-pilgrim-like, with staffe and slender store: Gen. 32. 10. Himselfe auowes, he carried thence no more. 91 God meetes him on his way, renewes againe The promise of the Messias, renewed to Iacob. Gen 28. That Great-free-Charter to his fathers giuen: Assures him that all feares and doubts were vaine, Shewes him a Ladder reaching vp to heauen, With Angels climbing vp, and downwards walking, Whil'st God to him, of blessed newes was talking. 92 Here th' holy Patriarke a vow did take, To worship God, and him for euer feare: This God, his sole Protector did he make, Begg'd of him bread to eate, and cloathes to weare. A simple almes, sought from the King of Kings: Court-beggers now, aske many richer things. 93 A Merchant bound vpon a great aduenter, A Comparison. For Countries farre remote, to him vnknowne, When as into the ship he first doth enter, In quest of forrein Lands, and leaues his owne: Sure of a skilfull Pilot at the Helme, Feares lesse, that Waues his Barke shall ouer-whelme. 94 So, Iacob guided by the worlds-wise-Maker, Wandring from Parents, and his natiue soyle: Is now become a ventrous vnder-taker, Walketh with courage bold, and feares no foyle: Lead on by him, who Abr'hams man did guide, A happy wife for Isa'k to prouide. 95 Gen. 24. &amp; 29.Their meetings were much like, some ods in speeding, The seruant for his Lord, had quick dispatch: Poore Iacob bound apprentice to sheepe-feeding, And then by Laban cheated in his match. Yet God, to recompence that iniurie, By Leah most blest his posteritie. 96 Gen. 49. 8.Shee bare him Iudah, Lord of all the rest, Not so by birth-right, but by Benediction: From whom was to descend Messias blest, To consummate that oft-foretold prediction. The Scepter from that Tribe might not depart, Till Shiloh came, the Gentiles to conuert. 97 In God this holy Patriarke put his trust, Despaire did neuer harbour in his brest: Gen. 28. 14.God said, his seede numbred should passe earths dust, And that in it, all Nations should be blest. Yet was he not so mad, his God to tempt, As if from Natures lawes he were exempt. 98 Gen. 32. &amp; 33. Reade ouer both these Chapters.His brother Esaus wrath he greatly fear'd, Strong were the motiues vrging him thereto: First, on his knees (his hands to heau'n vp rear'd.) He prayes: Then wisely plots what's best to doe. His stratagems were full of policie, God wrought by them his free deliuerie. 99 I read of one who sayling in the Deepe, A storie by way of comparison amplifying Iacobs pietie. Tost with a tempest, readie to be drown'd: Vow'd to a Saint (and there with all did weepe) If he might shun Seas rage which on him frown'd; To deck the shrine with costly ornaments, And doe deuotions with due complements. 100 The danger past, his foot once set on shore, Then laughs to heare himselfe the storie tell: He thinkes vpon the holy Saint no more, But sweares, on Seas hee'll neuer after dwell. “In time of neede most men to God can crie, Luc. 17. 12 18. “Few yeild him thankes for their deliuerie. 101 This holy Father bore a better minde, No sooner from the danger was he free: But forthwith he to worship God enclin'de, Gen. 33. 20. Erects an Altar to the Lord with glee. “Thankes for good-turnes receau'd, prepare a way, “For getting of the like another day. 102 Blessings pursue him still where he doth goe, The old confirm'd, with some encrease of newe: Gen. 35. 10. Iacob (sayes God) thou shalt be call'd no moe, But Prince of God, a Title to thee due. Israel. Gen. 32. 28. He sawe him face to face, stroue and preuayl'd, That style was to him and his seede entayl'd. 103 The Author of each good, and perfect gift, A Comparison. Though full of bountie and munificence: Like to a good housholder, learnes vs thrift, Directs how we our treasure should dispence. He giues not all to one, nor at one season, We must confesse he doth it with great reason. 104 “A filiall feare in faithfull men it breedes, Heb. 6. 19.“Sustayneth Hope, sure anchor of the soule: “Stirres vs to prayer in our greatest needes, “Repining and Impatience doth controule. “Man cloyd and glutted with prosperitie, “Declines to Pride, and grosse securitie. 105 From Paradise to Bethlem must I trace, The storie of the Womans Blessed Seede: Through Canaan my Muse hath run apace, And now makes-on for Egypt-Land with speede. There findes shee further proofe and euidence, Of Gods great goodnesse, and deepe prouidence. 106 Ioseph. Gen. 37. 3. Ioseph, his fathers best beloued sonne, (For that selfe cause his brethren did him hate) Is taught by dreames what after should be done, And sent before (as Moses doth relate) His Father and his Familie to cherish, Who else with famine had beene sure to perish. 107 Gen. 50. 20.“Men oft lay plots, and proiects doe propose “Of hatred, malice, pride, or auarice: “Yet God thereof doth otherwise dispose, “Proues them meere fooles, that thinke themselues most wise: “Exalteth him whom they seeke to throw downe, “And from the Dungeon lifts him to a Crowne. 108 Now Isr'el into Egypt comes in hast, There findes his once-lost-sonne in Princely grace: Gen. 45. 27. and 46. 30.His heart reuiues, to thinke of dangers past, Desires to die, when he had seene his face. Gen. 49. 8.Blessing his sonnes, he plainly prophecy'de From Iudahs line, Messias should proceede. 109 Good Ioseph likewise drawing neere his end, Instructed in the faith of his forefathers: To Iacobs God his soule doth recommend, Gen. 50. 24. From that Old-promise, strength of faith he gathers. Which caus'd him of his bones to haue a care, Heb. 11. 22. And to that purpose made his brethren sweare. 110 Loe, many hundred yeeres were ouer-past, And sundrie changes 'mong the sonnes of Eue: Since shee of the forbidden fruit did tast, And that Soule-sauing-promise did receaue. In euery age some holy men were found, Whose faith stood fast, vpon that rockie ground. 111 Th' example of such men, ioyn'd with Gods Word, Might haue suffic'd for all posteritie: Messias figured. Yet God vouchsaft more motiues to afford, To strengthen Faith, quell Infidelitie. With types, and figures set before their eyes, He shadowed out his hidden mysteries. 112 To write of all the wonders wrought by God On Mizraims Race, and their hard-hearted King: The strange effects produc't by Arons rod, Ere they from thence the Israelites did bring, I leaue: and onely trace the storie on, As I at first propos'd to write vpon. 113 Their riddance from th' Egyptian slauish yoke, Moses a type of Christ. By Moses (man of God) a type of Christ, Of whom prophetically he plainely spoke, Deut. 18. 15. Instructed by the Spirit of the High'st: Their plein-possession of the holy Land, To them deliuer'd by Duke Iosuas hand. Iosua. 114 Heb. 4.These taught them with the eyes of Faith to see, From spirituall Egypt their deliuerance, By him who should the Selfe-Messias bee, Inough to giue each good man full assurance, That th' onely Guide to the true Land of rest, Was Christ, in whom all Nations should be blest. 115 A two fold promise God did often make To Abraham: (marke well the Historie.) He ratify'de the same to Isaake, To Iacob eke, and his posteritie. First, that their seede should numberlesse encrease, And Canaans Land possesse in perfect peace. 116 Gen. 25. 20.It might haue seem'd a thing incredible, To aged men, whose wiues were barren both: This, once perform'd at full to Israel, Might easily confirme in them the troth Of that most Blessed-Seede; which thing was next, As you may cleerely finde in th' holy Text. 117 The Passeouer. Exod. 12.The Passeouer, most plaine and liuely token, A perfect Lambe, a Male, vnblemished: It must be slaine, yet not a bone be broken: How fully was't in Christ accomplished? Vers. 13.That bloud kept them from Egypts plague, so this Saues vs from Hell, and gaynes vs Heauens blisse. 118 The Red Sea. 1. Cor. 10. 2.Their passage through the Sea, and in the Clowd, Our holy Sacrament doth shadow-out: It saued them, but soone the Waters flow'd, And choak't the proud vncircumcised rout. “What Moses did for them, Christ did the same, “For all that trust in him, and feare his Name. 119 A wonder most, among those wonders all, Past Reasons reach, and Natures lawes exceeding: Sea-waters to stand steadie like a wall, Exod. 14. 22. And leaue the Deepe as drie as grounds for feeding! He onely that did Earth and Waters make, Could cause the Sea his dwelling to forsake. 120 From Egypt to the Desart we goe on. Of Pharaos Host the feare once ouer-past, The People fall away from God anon, Their confidence in him, declines in hast. His Promise old, they scarce beleeue for true, But that 'twas oft confirm'd by tokens newe. 121 Long was it not, ere that stiffe-necked Nation, Forgat what wonders God for them had wrought: They murmured, and fell to alteration, Grudging 'gainst Moses, bread and flesh they sought. Exod. 16. In Egypts flesh pots they tooke more content, Then in their freedome, and soules nourishment, 122 (Liue there not now some murmurers, thinke yee, At Moses and at Aron close-repining: Who lightly touch't with sword, or penurie, Run vp and downe the streets like dogs a-whining, Psal. 59. 14. Not caring, so they haue their ease, and fill; Let Church, and State and all goe which way 'twill!) 123 God rayned Manna, from his Throne aboue, He gaue them Bread, the blessed Angels food: Manna. Psal. 78. Exod. 26. 20. 17. Yet they against his Ordinance still stroue, The vse of it, few rightly vnderstood. “A figure 'twas of that true Bread indeed, Iob. 6. “Whereon all faithfull soules deuoutly feed. 124 “To some, the more you giue, the more they'll craue, So did this people in the Wildernesse: When they had Bread, then Water must they haue, Yet all would not content them nethelesse. The Rocke.There flowed store, forth gushing from the Rock, For them, their children, cattle, and their flock. 125 A type it was to strengthen their beliefe, Of that which often promis'd was before: Exod. 17. 7. 1. Cor. 10. 4.The place tooke name of chiding, and of strife, That Rocke, of Christ a true resemblance bore. From their distrust and infidelitie, God workes a meane for faith to fructifie. 126 Sinai.To Sinai holy Mountayne are we come, A place of terror, dreadfull to behold: Who feares not, when he reades what there was done? Or else by true relation heares it told? Exod. 19. 12. and 20. 18.A man, or beast that toucht the Hill, must die: The people that beheld, began to flie. 127 “How dares a mortall then those Lawes neglect, “By God deliuer'd in that fearefull wise? “Why are they not obseru'd with more respect? “Is there no feare of God before mens eyes? No hope of heauen, no regard of hell? No diff'rence put 'twixt doing ill, and well? 128 “That sweet-soule-sauing-promise made long since, “Renewed oft, and often ratify'de: “Doth not with men by any meanes dispence, “But that to morall Lawes they still be ty'de. “What though we cannot all the Law fulfill? “That Great-law-giuer doth accept good will. 129 Our weaknesse makes vs on the promise rest, Gal. 3. 24. And flie to him, who all the Law obay'd: Beleeue, and fast, and pray, and doe thy best, Then need'st thou not be doubtfull or dismay'd. “Faiths obiect to th' old Iewes and vs, was one: “They hop't for him, whom we beleeue is come. 130 There was in elder times a mightie Prince, A Simile, or apt Comparison, of the Lawes Morall, and Ceremoniall. A sonne he had who 'gainst him did rebell: Him the old father, for that foule offence, From Court into a Desart did expell: Where long he liu'd in vncouth banishment, Vntill his fathers furie gan relent. 131 That King dwelt in a spacious goodly Ile, A Countrey wondrous pleasant, rich and faire: Where Nature on her Creatures seemes to smile, The soile is fertile, healthfull is the aire. 'Tis euer day there, all the monthes are Sommers, There's roome enough, and spare too, for all commers. 132 All that liue there, are in degree of Kings, They feare no treason, nor conspiracie: Griefe, sorrow, sicknesse, death: why these are things Not knowne, nor spoken off in that Countrie. The famous Hill Amara, to this clime, Purchas Pilgr. lib. 7. Is but a muddie moore of dirt and slime. 133 The way was farre, the dangers manifold, With Rockes, and sandie shelues on euery shore: Yet he cheeres-vp his sonne, bids him be bold, When thou comm'st home, thou shalt goe thence no more. So ships him for his passage to this Land, Giues him a Chart, or Map in either hand. 134 The Morall Law.Sayes thus: My sonne, this Chart must be thy guide, And teach thee how thy course thou oughtest shape: Looke well vpon it, sayle on neither side, For if thou doe, be sure the Seas will gape, And sucke thee vp: therefore I say take heede, For iust as thou bee'st rul'd, so shalt thou speede. 135 The Ceremoniall Law.That Map, see in thy left hand still thou keepe, Though not of such esteeme as is the other: 'Tis for thy vse, while thou sayl'st on the Deepe, Account of it as of a yonger brother. Marke well the sundrie figures there exprest, They'll comfort thee, the greatest and the least. 136 These are true shadowes of reallities, Which in that happy place thou shalt enioy: When thou behold'st these pictures with thine eyes, Plucke vp thy heart, be of good cheere my boy: The substances thou shortly shalt attaine, Then vse this Map no more, 'twill be in vaine. 137 So dealt great-heauens-King with Israel, Some Lawes he gaue them, neuer to be broken: Some seru'd for complement, to paralell True things, whereof those shadowes were a token: That when they had the things, the signes might cease, And freed from feare, possesse their soules in peace. 138 The, Tabernacle.The Tabernacle, with its implements, And, that most holy place Sanctum Sanctorum, The vessells, tooles, and hallowed instruments, Exod. 26. Heb. ch. 7, 8, 9, and all that Epistle.Describ'd by Moses with diuine Decorum: Were types of better things thereby exprest, As we are taught by one who knew it best. 139 What meant the holy Oile that Moses made, The holy Oile Exod. 30. &amp; 40. Wherewith Kings, Priests, and Prophets were anointed? Of that Messias ointing 'twas a shade, At those his threefold offices it pointed. The Oile it selfe (free grace of th' Holy Ghost) Psal. 45. 8. and Heb. 1. 9. Aboue the rest, was powred on him most. 140 How could the bloud of Bulls, and Goates, and Calues, Sacrifices. Heb. 10. 4. And such like outward rudiments as these, Be for sinne-wounded men, soule-curing salues, And serue the turne, Gods anger to appease? “Soules stayn'd with sinne, such things could not clean-wipe, “But by affiance in the prototype. 141 Doubtlesse the Law of formall Iewish rites, To Christ, but chiefly to his Passion tended: So true is't (as the great Apostle writes) With him, and at his death they fully ended. Till then, they guided men him to expect, On whom all eyes of faith did still reflect. 142 One liuely type of Christ (that blessed Seede, So often promised, and shadow'd-out, The mayne-source of my song.) I plainely reade, And when I reade, am cleered of all doubt: As sure as I giue heede to th' holy Writ, So surely I beleeue the vse of it. 143 The Brasen-Serpent, lifted vp on hie, The brasen Serpent. Numb. 21. 8. Vpon a pole in all the peoples sight: It healed those that readie were to die, Whom fierie Serpents mortally did bite. The meaning of this place himselfe expounded, Iob. 3. 14. On whom that, and all th' other types were grounded. 144 Who feeles the sting of that flie Serpent old, Desires a salue that poyson to expell: This brasen Serpent with faiths eyes behold, Thou hast no neede to doubt of doing well. The type fail'd not the Isra'lites to cure, The thing it selfe, brings with it helpe more sure. 145 Ierusalem. Psal. 48. Iudg. 1. 8. 2. Sam. 5. Ierusalem, earths ioy, that peacefull seat, By Iudahs Tribe (from whom Messias came) First won: by Dauid next, who waxed great, Of Iewish worthies most in pow'r, and fame. Gal. 4 26.This Citie was the shadow of another, Of all Gods faithfull Children, the true Mother. 146 King Dauid. Psal. 22. 89. 110. 118, &amp;c. Matth. 1. and Luc. 3.Her King a Priest, a Prophet most diuine, True type of Christ (his Psalmes so often sing) Whose pedigree runs from that Royall line, By Law and Nature Israels rightfull King. What th' one did figure-out, th' other fulfill'd, So teach great Clerkes, in holy Writ best skill'd. 147 A man that had beene present in the place, What time our Lord his Passion did endure, And seene things acted iust before his face, Could not haue spoke more plainly, nor more sure: Psal. 22. &amp; 69.That they should giue him vineger and gall, His garments part, take's coate as lot did fall. 148 This Kingly-Priestly-Prophet once againe, 2. Sam. 8.Receau'd th' assurance of that promise old: Eccles. 47. 13.Though Solomon his honour soone did staine, With filthy Idols: yet one may be bold 2. Sam. 7. 14.To hope the best, that with milde chastisement, God wrought in him a full amendement. 149 (Haue not the best of men beene ouer-taken, Dauid, Manasses. Saint Peter, Saint Paul, &amp;c. Matth. 26. 56. With like offences to their great disgrace? Th' Apostles all, was not their faith sore shaken, When they forsooke Christ in his hardest case? It proues the Church hath need of Christ his ayde, Whil'st with mortalitie shee is array'de.) 150 This Solomon, the most magnificent, Solomon. The richest of all Kings that reign'd before, Beloued of the Lord Omnipotent: 2. Sam. 12. 24. As did his Sire, himselfe like Image bore. By him and his great state, were plainely meant, Psal. 45. &amp; 72. and Cant. throughout. Christ and his Church; which they did represent. 151 To him the Tirian Hiram, Gentile King, Hiram. 1. King. 5. For building that faire Temple of the Lord; Of Firre and Cedar trees great store did bring, They made a friendly league with one accord. A signe, that Iewes and Gentiles both should meet, To build the Church with loue, and concord sweet. 152 Was't euer read, or heard that any Nation 2. Sam. 7. 23. Were so instructed, guided, and directed By God himselfe? Sure none since the Creation: Yet neuer men, so much his Lawes neglected. Wer't not recorded in the holy Writ, (So strange it is) no man would credit it. 153 Had it not beene of Gods aboundant grace, Exod. 32. 10. 13. His Cou'nant and his Promise often made: He needes must haue consum'd that wicked Race, Who of transgressing, seem'd to make a Trade. Their Faith was faultie, and their Manners worse; Both which are threatned with a heauie curse. Deut. 28. 154 What though they did possesse the promis'd Land? Dwelt at Ierusalem, that holy Citie? Had Gods faire sacred Temple neere at hand? They fell from God, to Idolls: (was't not pitie?) Despis'd those Lawes diuine, most iust and right, Which Moses gaue, and God himselfe did writ. 155 Ier. 2.O Israelites, hard-hearted, Beetle-blinde, That cannot see, or seeing will not see! O Nation of all Nations most vnkinde, A mirrour of grosse Infidelitie! The things which for your good were first deuis'd, By you are most, of all men else, despis'd. 156 “Who now may stand vpon forefathers right? “Or boast of their discent from holiest Saints? “Or who may pleade prescription in Gods sight, “Whom foule defection in their faith once taints? “I finde no warrant to oblige Gods grace, “To any Countrey, Person, Time, or Place. 157 That mightie Monarch, Earths and Heauens Lord, To whom all Monarkes else are Wormes, and Ants: Vouchsaf't himselfe to speake that gracious word, Not vsing Heraulds-helpe, nor Purseuants. He told those Kings, and those good Patriarks, What afterwards was taught by Scribes and Clarks. 158 Messias prophecied. Heb. 1.By Messengers henceforth he tells his minde, Oft puts his people in remembrance: Who else were most forgetfull, and most blinde, Securely liu'd, setled with ignorance. 'Mongst all their Kings, scarce one of ten is found, Whose life was godly, and his faith right sound. 159 They thought, sith they had Abr'ham to their father, It was enough to get his heritage: His Faith and Workes they should haue follow'd rather, Things sleighted then, as they are in this age. Such sonnes, that holy Father hath great plentie: True Abrahamites, as then, so now are daintie. 160 Now must we marke how in the times succeeding, God taught and school'd those people so vntoward: Their state declin'd, Religion lay a bleeding, The men were most stiffe-necked, stubborne, froward. One meane would not suffice, all to amend: He vsed many, tending to one end. 161 Much like a great Commander in the warres, A Comparison. Who rules an Host compos'd of sundrie Nations: Some prone to mutines, quarrels, strife, and jarres, Some giu'n to sloth, and idle recreations: Some coward-cranes, when they should march to fight, Bethinke them of the readiest way for flight. 162 Some others, like good men at armes in deed, Performe all duties with their vtmost pow'rs: Still prest to helpe their Captayne at his need, Stand Centinels at pointed place, and how'rs: By wise forecast, and warlike policie, Deales not alike with all this companie. 163 One sort with gifts, and faire rewards he bindes, With martiall rigour others doth correct: By promises to some, he sounds their mindes, Some he casseers, and wholly doth reiect: And thus by skilfull warlike discipline, Effects with good successe his full designe. 164 So the great Lord of Hosts with Israel deales, A people hard to rule, as euer any: His will to them, by Prophets he reueales, Some by sharpe stripes, by promises winnes many By threatnings often he affrights the rest, With blessings manifold rewards the best. 165 The Prophets.Pervse the sacred Volumes of Records, Writ by those holy Pen-men, heauenly Scribes Aboundant proofe, each one of them affords, Of Gods proceeding with the Iewish Tribes. And all, to make them of that Promise, Heires; Seal'd to the holy Patriarks, and theirs. 166 Ier. 25. &amp; 15. &amp; 50. &amp;c.One Prophet daunts them with captiuitie, Heart-pining famine, sword and pestilence: Then comforts them with their deliuerie, Threats to their foes a heauie recompence. Thus with sharpe-pills halfe-dead, he them reuiues, Renewes their strength with sweet restoratiues. 167 Esay 47. Eze. 30. Amos 1.Another, to deterre them from their sinnes, And fright them by their neighbours punishment: With threats and plagues on Heathen folke beginnes, Thereby to cause the Isralites relent. The mildest way of fatherly correction, For drawing stubborne sonnes to due subiection. 168 A Simile.Thus deale fond mothers with their wanton boyes, Who in their hearts possesse the neerest place: Alluring them oft-times with pleasing toyes, Somewhiles they'll whip a slaue, or vassall base, For childrens faults: Or beat the clothes they weare, And by such fetches, keepe them in some feare. 169 God, euer mindfull of his Couenant, And that Good promise made, eft-soones renew'd To Abraham his friend, and faithfull seruant, And others in the ages that ensu'de: By Prophets still pursues his first intent, Assures them that Messias shall be sent. 170 All faithfull Men and Women 'mongst the Iewes, Iob. 4. 25. Held constantly that ground-worke of their Creede: The Fathers told their Children this good newes, Taught them the Promise of that Blessed Seede. Yet all points, in each age, not fully showne, Some mysteries were by degrees made knowne. 171 Great things and many are of him foretold, Some of his Birth, his Life, his Gouernment: His Passion and his Suffrings manifold, Yet all agree with vniforme consent. One vtters plainely what in darker speech, Another in selfe-sense doth elsewhere teach. 172 His Birth, a thing that farre exceedes beliefe, Messias birth prophesied. Were faith to Natures lawes, and reason bound: It was foretold in wordes most plaine and briefe, The speech by fact full true long after found: That of a Virgin pure immaculate, Es. 7. 14. He should be borne. (Was neuer birth like that!) 173 His Name more wonderfull then was his Birth, His name Immanuel. A mysterie of mysteries contayn'd: Immanuel, as much as Heauen on Earth, Or God with vs: (The sense neede not be strayn'd.) Notes both his Natures, humane and diuine, Which one selfe Person strangely should combine. 174 Isaiah.Thou holy man of God, aboue all other, Who things to come, most plainly didst foresee: How could'st thou say, a Maide should be a Mother, And couple childe-birth with Virginitie! Onely this childe of whom thou dost foretell, Instructed thee to speake the truth so well. 175 These secrets deepe, ere thou didst them reueale, (For neuer doe I finde them told before) It seemes were not yet know'n in Israel: Once publisht, were beleeued more and more. Though long vntill the thing was full effected, The prophecie no good man yet neglected. 176 And sith Messias was by birth a King, From Iudah rightly drawing his discent: Mal. 3. of Iohn Baptist, tho Harbinger of Messias.Sith he to Isreal great ioy should bring; An Harbinger before him must be sent, (As Princes vse) his comming to declare, And for his Person, passage to prepare. 177 Es. 11. 6. and 65. 25.The manner how this Royall childe should come, Was fully seene by them who thereof write: The manner of his comming.Not Souldier-like, with Trumpet, Fife, and Drum, Or armed troupes, to skirmish for his right. Then 'twas foreshow'n, that bloudie waues should cease, And Nations all securely liue in peace. 178 Not in a rich triumphall Charet set, Nor mounted on a stately barbed Steede: No Lordlings great, nor Captaynes with him met, To guard his person (such he did not neede.) Zech. 9. 9. 10.In lowely wise he on an Asse must ride; Iustice and Peace wayting on either side 179 The Place likewise in which he should be bore, The Place Mich. 5. (A circumstance 'mongst others to be heeded.) Precisely named by one Prophet more, Who told it as in after-times succeeded. “(All true Relations soundly 'gree together, “Of falsities th' one jumps iust right with neither.) 180 A scantling of the Time by some is taken, The Time. Dan. 7. &amp; 9. and 12. Yet sealed vp, and hid from vulgar eyes: When Isr'els state lyes waste, and all-to-shaken, Depriued of the daily sacrifice: Ere long must come that Ancient of dayes, Messias hight; who Dauids Throne shall rayse. 181 Yet one, to shew what after should betyde, Ionah. Is swallowed by a Fish within the Deepe: Three dayes shut vp in it he did abyde, So long our Lord, within his graue must sleepe. That, cast on Land, his errand did fulfill: This, rising vp, perform'd his Fathers will. 182 O wondrous Childe, great God, the Prince of peace, Es. 9. 6. Mayne subiect of all holy prophecies: Who may relate thy Kingdomes great encrease, Micha. 4. Thy Churches glorie 'mong posterities! All Gentiles with the Iewes shall thither flie, Es. 54 Both ioyne to make vp one fraternitie. 183 By thee, that glorious building must be rays'd, Thou Master-builder, and chiefe corner stone: Es. 28. 16. Thy Name among the Saints be euer prays'd, All laud and honor bee to thee alone. Thou onely Shephard of thy chosen flock, Es. 34. 23. And of that house, the sure-foundation-rock. 184 Num. 23. 10.Who may recount the dust of Iacobs seede, Or number-vp one quarter of that trayne, Whereof in sacred Historie we reade, Es. 60. 4.That shall resort, and thither flock amayne! Psal. 72. 10.When Kings shall bring their treasure vnto thee, Es. 49. 23.And Queenes make sute, thy Nurses for to bee. 185 Es. 55. 1.Come, come all people to this heauenly Court, Come rest your selues vpon this holy Mount: Come drinke sweet Waters and pay nothing for't, Come take rich treasures, yeilding no account. Why come you not, when such a King doth call, Who hath enough to giue content to all? 186 Psal. 45. 33.Here reignes a Queene all glorious within, With costly Robes, and Iewells richly drest; Her beautie each beholders heart doth win, Come wait on her, enioy sweet ease, and rest. Why will yee dwell in Dennes, and sluttish Caues? You may be free, why will you then be slaues? 187 Be thou into this seruice once retayn'd, Thy name within the houshold-booke enroll'd: When thou the badge and cognisance hast gayn'd; Wisd. 5.Keepe th' orders of the Court: And then be bold, For, whom this King so specially selects, Those men he neuer afterward reiects. 188 Es. 49. 15.What mother can forget her onely childe, The birth conceau'd, and bred vp in her wombe? And though shee should 'gainst nature wax so wilde, As wish earths-bowells did her birth entombe: Yet heauens Father deales not so with those, Whom for adopted sonnes he once doth chose. 189 “First shall the Sunne forbeare to giue his light, Ier. 31. 35. “And Seas forsake the bounds to them assign'd: “The Moone and Starres shall shine no more by night, “All Creatures else, turne-head against their kind: “Ere he his chosen heritage forsake, “And breake the Cou'nant, which he once did make. 190 Who can instruct all this faire companie, Attendants on so great a King of state? Teach them their points of true Nobilitie, And make them meete, on such a Prince to waite? No man shall neede aske questions of his brother, Ier. 31. 33. 34. Nor one giue rules of Courtship to another. 191 The King himselfe shall shew to them his will, And print his Lawes so firmely in their heart; The youngest there, may soone attayne the skill To doe his dutie, and performe his part: With due deuoire to serue his Soueraigne, And loue among his fellowes to maintaine. 192 “Enuie, that foule disease, that fretting canker, A description of Enuie. “That breakes the gall, and gnawes the very bones, “Makes fat-backs soone grow slender, leane and lanker, “Dwells mostly in the hearts of greatest Ones: Knowes not the way to come within this gate, Each one here, as himselfe, so loues his Mate. 193 Ambition, pride, selfe-loue, the common crimes, That in great Princes Courts too much abound: Smooth tongues, and hollow hearts, which in these times, In Countrey, Court, and Citie, rife are found; Be farre exiled from this blessed place, Such persons here, are euer in disgrace. 194 The blessednes of the old I wes.O happy people, seede of Israel, To you and yours the Promise first was giuen: You onely in this house of God might dwell, Act. 2. 39.You onely knew the way, that lead to Heauen.

Your Prophets all, on him did fixe their hope, To guide you vnto him, was all their scope. 198 Then, as you are the true Heires by discent, And haue the start by Primogeniture; Aduize what was the purpose and intent Of Moses, and all other holy Scripture; Be readie when he comes, him to receaue: With doting dreames, doe not your selues deceaue. 199 The tokens all, that should his Birth fore-goe, Those haue you seene, in order verifi'd: With inward ioy your hearts should ouer-flowe, Be not with wordly scandalls scarifi'd. He is your King (that iustly is his Name) Count not his Crosse, and Suffrings for your shame. 200 Frame not a King within your idle braine, Such one as Moses neuer told you off: Thinke not the holy prophecies were vaine, Of him whom they describe, make not a scoff. The time drawes neere, when he himselfe shall show, By that which hath beene said, you may him know. 201 Here leaue I now these Isra'lites awhile, And hasten forward towards Bethlehem: Poetick license, must your thoughts beguile: Conceaue we iourney from Ierusalem.

Thinke on that Blessed Childe his wondrous birth, Which had God for his Father, and none other: A Virgin pure and spotlesse to his Mother? 204 My heart (me thinkes) within my body skips, With ioy my senses neere themselues haue lost: My tongue cannot be kept within the lips, My feet are swift, to beare me there in post. Heart, Senses, Tongue and Feet striue altogether, Which best shall doe their due, when they come thither 205 A Simile.A Pilgrim iournying in a forrein Land; Vnexpert in the way where he must goe: Seekes out some Guide, to leade him by the hand, Least in the Wildes he wander to and fro. Thus safely comes he to his iourneyes end, Then thankes the Guide, esteemes him for his friend. 206 Loe I poore Pilgrim dull, ignorant, halfe-blinde, Deuoutly bent vpon this pilgrimage: Met many Guides all skilfull, faithfull, kinde, I put my selfe into their patronage: They set me neere the Subvrbs of the Towne, I humbly thanked them. Then kneeling downe, 207 The Authors prayer.Great God (quoth I) Protector of the Iust, The Guide of faithfull, meeke, and humble men: Who neuer faylest them that in thee trust, Who see'st the heart, the inward thoughts dost ken: Selfe-wise-conceited-Doctors dost besot, And cause them speake oft-times they know not what. 208 By Babes and Infants soundest out they prayse, Enablest them to speake of mysteries: To sing such secrets with soule-soothing layes, As thou hast hid from worldly-wizards eyes. Thou know'st what mou'd me to this holy taske, Thou art not blear'd with vizard, or with maske. 209 First, pardon for my boldnesse I desire, Yeild humble thankes for ayde alreadie giuen: A further boone, lowe kneeling I require, Show me the path that leades direct and euen, To bring me safely to my iourneyes end, And gayne the Goale, whereto my Muse doth tend. 210 So here I vow, in singlenesse of heart, (Sith better gifts to offer I haue none) With those three pious Kings to beare a part; Matth. 2. 1. and looke Class. 2.

The second Classis. THE ARGVMENT. Messias Birth fore-showne first to his Mother, A Virgin pure both in, and after childing: To Ioseph afterwards, and to some other. Sheep-keeping prays'd, a life contentment yeilding The worth and vse of noble Heraldrie. A short defence of Sacred Poesie. 1 Oft haue I trauail'd in a winters night, A Simile, setting out the obscuritie that was of Messias comming, in the times next preceding his birth. Wherein Dame Phœbe neuer shew'd her face: The lesser sparkling fiers gaue some light, By which (with heed) my iourney I might trace. I still expected when the day would peere, And faire Aurora shew her count'nance cleere. 2 As shee began to rayse her selfe from bed, The Vshers making way for her approach: Bright Phœbus hast'ning to thrust out his head, And day all prest, in sisters roome t'encroach: A sodaine shade, worse then all night before, Beset me round, and dim'd mine eyes much more. 3 Till Titan rowsed with that bold affront, His Princely-palace-gates thrust ope in hast, Calls for his Charret, swiftly mounts vpon't, His sight these gloomie shades full quickly chas't. By helpe of whose resplendent glorious rayes, All trauailers might well discerne their wayes. 4 Wisd. 5. 6. Reuel. 22. 16. &amp; Num. 24. 17.So, neere before this Sunne of Righteousnesse, Bright-morning-starre rose vp, the worlds true light: Egyptian darknesse did mens hearts possesse, The prophecies lay hid, as with darke night. An argument, Messias birth drew neere, Whose comming should all doubtfull scruples cleere. 5 The Authors prayer to be enlightned by the true Light of Lights. Great Light of Lights, selfe-light, whose glorious beames, Lend lustre to all lesser lights besides, When on their Orbes his glitt'ring rayes he streames, A glimpse whereof on their Stella est densior pars sui Orbis. thick-stuffe abides: Whereby of borrowed light they get a share, Which in themselues obscure, and darksome are. 6 Refine the Orbe of my grosse muddie braine, So cleere it with thy all-enlightning splendor: That thereby some small insight I may gaine, Some sparke of heauenly Light it may ingender: Which set vpon a candle-stick, may shine, Guide many hearts to thee, as well as mine. 7 The Glorious Father, Lord, and King of Kings, Who Heauen and Earth, and all therein created: Ere he his sonne into this Mansion brings, Resolues, the matter should be first related, To persons, and by meanes, as he decreed: Of Counsellors therein he had no need. 8 The blessed Virgin. Luc. 1. 26.With her who was to be blessed Mother, He first beginnes (so goes the sacred Storie.) Shee heard that happy newes before all other, Such was his will, to tender her that glorie. The Angelicall salutation.An Angell hayles her, Marie full of grace, Blessed art thou aboue all Womens race. 9 No maruaile, if at first shee stood amaz'd, And muzed what the Salutation meant: But when the Angell had his message blaz'd, And told the errand, whereon he was sent; Shee shooke of feare, and doubt; full satisfi'd By faith, in that which th' Angell propheci'd. 10 Thinke not the blessed Virgin did distrust, Her question proceedeth not out of distrust. In asking how that wonder might be done: To be resolu'd at full shee had a lust, How shee without mans helpe, should beare a sonne, The question issued not from vnbeliefe, Her absolute assent, was quicke and briefe. 11 A mother when shee heares a sure narration, A Comparison. Of some great honour hap'ned to her child: Tickled with ioy, shee prayes a fresh relation, And yet when shee within her selfe smil'd, As if shee had forgotten what was said, To heare the newes once more, shee's well apaid. 12 Some, out of weake beliefe such questions make, As Moses when the people cry'd for meate: Though God himselfe the taske did vndertake, Num. 11. 21. To giue them flesh, their bellies full to eate: How many sixe hundred thousand men (said hee) Suffic'd with flesh, here in this Desert bee? 13 Such was the fickle faith of Zacharie, Luc. 1. 18. Who to the Angels word gaue small beliefe And Nicodemus was as weake as hee, Iob. 3. 4. 9. Albeit it a Pharise among the chiefe. Through weaknesse these cast doubts, how that might bee, The meanes whereof, they did not plainly see. 14 Some others, of meere incredulitie, Much like brute beasts, leane wholly to their sense: They'll credit nought, but what doth full agree With Natures lawes, fits their intelligence. 2. King. 7.Such was that Prince to whom Elisha spake, Who of his wordes, a small account did make. 15 Some others all as bad, or rather worse, Aske questions in dirision, and scorne: Iob. 18. 38.As Pilate, when with him Christ did discourse, Made manifest the cause why he was borne, Told him the Truth. What thing is Truth (quoth hee) As who should say, I know't as well as thee. 16 Her diuine song Magnificat. Luc. 1. 46.The Virgin quickly fell to her deuotions, And fram'd a dittie hight Magnificat: Where shee expresseth sundrie heauenly motions; Neuer sang Maide so sweet a song as that. With heart and soule in God shee did reioyce, Who had vouchsaft, of her to make his choice. 17 To speake of euery point, would be too long, One clause that fits my Theame, I must obserue: How, to shut-vp her soule-delighting-song, From ancient Hebrewes vse, shee doth not swerue; But sticks to Abr'ham, and that promise old, Her faith in that, caus'd her to be more bold. 18 Ioseph. Matth. 1. 19.From Iosephs eyes the thing awhile was hid, Espoused they had beene, not fully wedded: He muz'd how of his Mate he mought be rid, When bigge he found her, neuer by him bedded. Then in a dreame, God shewes him what was done, And that Worlds-Sauiour-Iesus was her sonne. 19 The man obedient to this heauenly vision, Ioyous (no doubt) and with the newes well pleas'd: Embrac't his wife, repented his misprision, In heart and soule much comforted and eas'd, He tooke her home, and knew her not before, Nor, Till, her first begotten sonne shee bore. Matth. 1. 25. 20 Here busie heads some doubts and scruples raise, Questions about the blessed Virgins perpetuall Virginitie. 'Mongst sober Christians well to be forborne: Yet sith they oft be argued in these daies, I'll say my minde: (whereto I durst be sworne) As shee our Lord did beare, a Virgin pure; So all her life (say I) shee did endure. 21 Though Iesus styled be her first-borne sonne, Obiections, or Cauills. It argues not that shee should beare another: For Christ is nam'd, Gods first begotten sonne, Heb. 1. 6. Yet, in that sense, he neuer had a brother. We are Gods children by adoption, Iob. 1. 14. He onely is by birth, and by conception. 22 Vntill (say some) an after-time implyes, Plaine pointed at, when Ioseph should her knowe: That word (with them) their fancie verifyes, Then huddle-vp a few coniectures moe: They dwelt together, iourney'd here and there, Matth. 2. 14. &amp; Luc. 2. 51. In all respects, as man and wife they were. 23 Coniectures bare, the question to decide; Answere to the Cauills. This word Vntill, a diuerse sense admits: Most times in Scripture, makes on th' other side, Neuer at all, with that word often fits. When Samuel came no more to visit Saul, 1. Sam. 15. 35. Till death: it's meant, he sawe him not at all. 24 Matth. 5. 18. 26. and oft elsewhere.Of such like phrases holy Writ hath store, Which rather cleere the case, then leaue a doubt: What though one Mansion held them? At one doore Did enter in, and at one doore went out. These were no blots to her Virginitie, Whose soule was wedded to Diuinitie. 25 This may inferre, shee liu'd not in a Cell, A Recluse mew'd-vp from societie: Her vertues rare, had not appear'd so well, Had shee refrayn'd her selfe from companie. Matth. 5. 16.“The liues of holy Christians ought to shine, “And giue a lustre in their Neighbours eyne. 26 How could it be, that one in such great grace Luc. 1. 28. 35.With God, o're-shadow'd by the holy Ghost, For any carnall thought should leaue a place, Within her brest? Nay, he that lou'd her most, A man iust, holy, would not so abase her, As with a fleshly thought, once to embrace her. 27 Another Obiection answered.They vrge, and aske: Why was shee then a wife? (On reasons Base, these Builders ground their creede.) Loe, Reason shall yee haue to end the strife, Though for my part, I hold it more then neede. To honour Marriage, and Virginitie, Fit was it Shee both Wife, and Maide should bee. 28 Matth. 1. 19.To shun the scandall of the common Crue, Enclined to reprochfull obloquie, Before her spotlesse innocence prou'd true, Shee had stood subiect to their curtesie. God was not pleas'd, all men at first should know, What he to Ioseph in a dreame did show. 29 Reflect your eyes vpon our Grandame Eue, Bethinke you of her fault in Paradise: When her the subtill Serpent did deceaue, To eate the fruit forbidden, did entice. Marke punctually what in the Text yee reade, Gen. 3. 15. Note this. The Promise was, vnto the Womans Seede: 30 Not to the Man. Of him there is no speach: Now see how God, precisely kept his Word: We must beleeue, as holy Scriptures teach, Man had no part in getting Christ our Lord. The holy Ghost supply'de the Husbands steed: There's no immediate mixture of mans seed. 31 When Peter once his Master had deny'd, Matth. 26. 69. Proceeding on, he made the matter worse: His errour with an oath he ratifi'd, And lastly he began to sweare, and curse. Thrice after, he confest, was lou'd the more: Iob. 21. 15. Settled in state of grace, iust as before. 32 In such like sort God with poore Eua deales, To comfort her, and keepe out sad despaire: The purpose of his grace he straight reueales, And made a promise of that Blessed Heire, Which he performed many Ages after, To this pure Virgin, Eua's blessed Daughter. 33 The next (I note) to whom it was reueal'd, Elizabeth. Who spake distinctly of that true Messias; Elizabeth. Had shee the thing conceal'd, Luc. 1. 41. Yet in her wombe, there leapt a young Elias: He to his Mother gaue full euidence, Of that which soone prou'd true b'experience. 34 Shee prophecy'd as plaine as any other, Uers. 42.Possessed wholly by the holy Ghost: How is it that my blessed Sauiours Mother, Vouchsafes to visit me in this hill coast? Among our female Sexe, none blest like thee, Yet shall thy birth it selfe, more blessed bee. 35 Zacharie. Luc. 1. 67.But, holy man of God, good Zacharie, More fully shewes what shortly should be done: Inspired with the Spirit of prophecie, (As all old Prophets since the world begunne) Lookes backe vnto that ancient Couenant, First made to Abraham Gods faithfull seruant 36 His song called Benedictus. Luc. 1. 68.He frames a most diuine Propheticke song, By name of Benedictus know'n to all: Aduize and marke it well (it is not long) Full fraught with passages Celestiall, Of Christ, that sonne of Dauid oft foretold, The source and subiect of all Prophets old. 37 Wherein is described our Sauiour Christ.Describes him to descend of Dauids line, A Prince to saue them from their Enemie, According to predictions diuine, Gods oath to Abraham, and his Progenie: To th' end they might liue holily and iust, Vpon this Sauiour, fixe their onely trust. 38 And Saint Iohn the Baptist.And thou my Childe that art so strangely bore, The Prophet of the Highest is thy Name: His Herault thou must be to runne before, Mens hearts vnto obedience to frame: To leade them out of darknesse into light, And guide them in the way of peace aright. 39 What wondrous heauenly passages are these? Who euer read such strange euents before? A feare on all the hearers hearts 'gan seaze: Yet listen on a whiles, you shall heare more. We hasten to the birth of Israels Prince, The like was not before, nor euer since. 40 Note here, no tache of Heathenish superstition, Against profane and superstitious casting of Natiuities. No calculating of Natiuities: (A crime too rife 'mongst men of high condition) But free assent to sacred Prophecies, Fast-grounded faith on Gods old Word of grace, Which in all faithfull hearts still held a place. 41 Now seemes the season fit to sing of Feasts, (At Princes births much vs'd) and costly iunkets: Mark. 6. 21. Resort of Ladies, Lords, and princely ghests, To spend the time in sports, and sumptuous bankets: A chamber furnisht with rich chaires of state, And all things fitting such a royall Mate. 42 For Seruitors, a goodly spacious Hall, To hold the houshold folke, and common stranger. Loe, here the Childing chamber was a Stall, The Cradle for this Prince, was but a Manger. Humilitie attended at his birth, It neuer left him whilst he liu'd on earth. 43 Some Hagarens (no doubt) did laugh and scorne, And mocked at this King of Israel, Whom they perceau'd in such meane manner borne: As did that base-broode fleshly Ishmael, At Sarahs happy sonne: So th' Ishmalites Gen. 21. 9. Now scorne, hate, persecute true Abramites. 44 Herewith good Christians are not scandaliz'd, It rather giues them cause of inward mirth: Es. 41.Sith in the Sacred Writ 'tis oft compris'd, That such should be the manner of his birth. Matth. 18. 1.“So, we by his example may be humbled, “And learne, that proud men shall to hell be tumbled. 45 Of this one Point a Volume might be writ, My Muse cannot endure prolixitie: Shee hastens to some other things more fit, Which sute with th' order of the Historie: Her Theame, a world of Matter doth afford, A Dittie might be fram'd on euery word. 46 Though outward pompe, and maiestie here wanted, Wherewith great earthly Princes Courts doe shine: In heauenly state this Lady was not scanted, Her ornaments, and Waiters were diuine. As was the King, such were his Courtiers all; The eyes of Faith, see them maiesticall. 47 2. King. 6. 16.So then, this Queene was neuer left alone, Elisha and his man were not so warded; An Host of Angels round about her shone, With those her Sonne, her Selfe, her Court were guarded. No treason could be plotted or begun, But sooner 'twas disclos'd, then thought vpon. 48 A Comparison.When Henries Mate, of Yorke the lawfull Heire, Her siluer-white Rose, with his red entwin'd, Of English King and Queene the blessed Paire, By whom two Royall houses were combin'd, And shee deliuer'd of a goodly Boy: Who could expresse the height of Englands ioy? 49 The newes forthwith by Heraulds skill was blaz'd, The Trumpets shrill in euery street did sound: The vulgar sort with mirth were halfe amaz'd, The Court with wreaths of Oliue decked round: Faire Albions Ile was neuer so much blest, From ciuill broiles, endow'd with peace and rest. 50 By this my simple-sample ('tis no more Compared with the birth of Israels King) Note in what wretched state men stood before, Till he true peace into the world did bring. Of Nations twaine, vnited he made one: Vnion of Iewes and Gentiles by Christ. Ephes. 2. 14. Sole Monarch rules them both, himselfe alone. 51 This ioyfull newes 'twas meet should be made knowne, Swift Messengers were soone dispatcht away, By them we read the tidings first was showne, Luc. 2. 8. &amp;c Eu'n instantly before the breake of day, To Shepherds, who by night did watch and keepe, From rauening Woolues, their tender flocks of Sheepe. 52 Here's due decorum kept. Poore silly Swaynes, First made pertakers of this happy newes: An Angell wayted-on with heauenly Traynes, Vers. 13. Tells this glad tidings, to some shepherd Iewes. Great Lordlings of the Land, as yet neglected: And simple Shepherds, they were first selected. 53 “Gods wisedome suites not with mans worldly wit, “Their counsails be but shallow, his are deepe: “What euer he decrees, he acteth it, “His eye of prouidence doth neuer sleepe. “By things in nature simple, base, and weake, 1. Cor. 1. 27. “The mightiest he throwes downe, their pow'r doth breake. 54 Thou tyrant Pharao, swell vntill thou burst, 2. King. 18. Senacherib, raile on the liuing Lord: Iudg. 13. 6.Proud Holofernes vaunt thee, doe thy worst, A woman pares thy head, with thy owne sword. The other twaine that trusted in their might, Without or speare, or sword, were put to flight. 55 Matth. 23. 12.“Be humble then before the King of heauen, “That's th' onely way to sit sure, and mount higher: “Who takes the lesse on him, shall haue more giuen; “But downe falls he, that proudly doth aspire. “Gods message to these men of lowe degree, “Directs the highest to humilitie. 56 A digression in commendation of the Shepherds life.Come gentle Shepherds helpe me pen a song, Wherein I may describe your happy life: I feare for lacke of skill to doe you wrong. Is not your trade free from debate, and strife? From enuie, pride, excesse, and vaine ambition? Are yee not sweetly pleas'd, with your condition? 57 Whilst on the Hills your fleesie flocks doe feede, Your trustie Dogge, sure watch and ward doth keepe: You play and pipe vpon an oaten reede, Then sing a Caroll, till you fall asleepe. You feare no poyson mixt among your drinke, Of such infernall tricks, you neuer thinke. 58 Whilst little Lambkins friske about and skip, The gentle Dammes, goe nibbing on the grasse; Somewhiles run to the Troughs, and fetch a sip; Then by your side, and round about you passe: Till at your whistles sound, both young and old, Prepare themselues, and hasten to the fold. 59 Meanewhile (O happy men) you haue the leasure, To spend the time in holy Meditation: To sing a Psalme (sweet-soule-delighting pleasure) To note the greatest workes of the Creation: The Sunne, the Moone, the Planets and the Starres, Not scarifi'd with broiles, or bloudy warres. 60 To marke the diff'rent seasons of the yeere, In each of them, the sundrie alterations: How swift-wing'd Boreas makes the Coast all cleere, How Phœbus drawes vp watrie exhalations: Whence dewes, and snowes, &amp; haile, and raine proceed, Which makes the herbes to grow, the cattle breed. 61 How louingly the Ewes entreat their Lambes, Giue them the Teat, till they haue drunke their fill: Then graze along, fore-guided by the Rammes. (Examples teaching men and women skill.) A thousand obseruations more you finde, To please the eye, and to content the minde. 62 Nor are you bound alone to contemplation, Oft-times your calling keepeth you in action: When Beares, and Woolues, fierce rau'nous generation Assault your fouldes: By their vniust coaction, You play the men, and combat for your flocks, The beasts that offer wrong, you quit with knocks. 63 Like good Physicians, one while must you drench, One while like Surgeons, ope a veyne for bleeding: Then stop againe, and make the issue stanch, Turne to the fould, then driue abroad to feeding. Thus soule and body both, are still imploy'd: By enterchange, there's neither of them cloy'd. 64 No state on earth, like yours, so much is blest, So free from vice: That leades so sure a way To quietnesse on earth, and endlesse rest: That is so fit to meditate and pray. To you was opened first Messias birth, The Lord and King of heauen, and of earth. 65 Examples. Abel.No maruaile then, if men of holiest life, Of greatest worth, with God in highest grace, Haue Shepherds beene. This calling was most rife Among Gods people, ancient Hebers Race. Gen. 4. and Heb. 11. 4.First Abel, he whose Offrings God respected, When Cain and his Oblation was reiected. 66 Iacob and Rachel. Gen. 29. 9. Iacob and Rachel his best-loued wife, Were both Sheep-keepers: (note the storie well.) Had it not beene a faire contented life, Would he, by God sirnamed A Prince of God. Israel, Betane himselfe to such a trade of liuing? Gen. 30.God blessed him thereby, and made it thriuing. 67 Moses. Exod. 3. and Heb. 11. Moses that man of God, who did refuse To be entitled Pharaos daughters sonne: A solitarie shepherds life did choose, The pompe of Egypts Court thereby to shunne. By keeping sheepe, he learn'd to rule a Nation, The most vnruly since the worlds creation. 68 Gen. 46. 34. Egyptian Idolaters, they deem'd The shepherds, as a meere abomination: What then? That should not make them dis-esteem'd, But to be held in higher estimation. “The thing which wicked worldlings doe despise, “Ought seeme more precious in a good mans eyes. 69 The worthiest of them all, the holiest, King Dauid. 1. Sam. 16. 7. Dauid a King, a Prophet, and a Priest, Of Iessees sonnes though youngest, and the least, Yet best and great'st, by iudgement of the High'st: Among all shepherds he may beare the bell, Great King of Iudah, and of Israel. 70 A man in peace, wise; valiant in the warre, Vers. 18. Who slue a ramping Lion, and a Beare: Bold on his God aduentred on so farre, To charge Goliah arm'd with shield and speare: He, furnisht onely with a sling, and stone, And swordlesse, heads the Giant with his owne. 71 These rare examples 'mong Gods people deare, Would moue a man, that were not void of sense: Yet could I make the matter farre more cleare, But here my Muse entreats you to dispense: For long disgressing, shee falls in your grace, Reserues the rest vnto another place. 72 Those happy shepherds, hauing seene the vision, Looke backe before at Sion. 46. Luc. 2. 15. Consult together, what was best be done: Without delay, or carelesse intermission, They haste to see the Mother, and her Sonne: They found it iust eu'n as the Angell said. These wordes close in her heart, the Virgin laid. 73 How doe they then? Conceale what they had seene? Or adde new-coyn'd relations of their owne? Not so: As it to them reueal'd had beene, So, all abroad that coast they made it knowne. While people wondred, they to God gaue prayse, Reioycing in their hearts, to see those dayes. 74 Next, Gentiles from a Countrey more remote, Are call'd to doe their homage to this King: Long had they beene neglected, and forgot, Ezech. 34. 23. 2. Esd. 2. 34.Yet all the Prophets did fore-tell the thing, That one great Shepherd should make vp one flock, And graffe both Iewes, and Gentiles on one stock. 75 They presse not to this Feast, like Ghests vnbidden, Nor by aduenture, stumble on the place: That Mysterie which had so long lyen hidden, God opened to them freely, of his grace: Sith they were strangers, and their Countrey farre, Matth. 2. 2.They were conducted by a speciall starre. 76 Not such, as fixt are in the firmament, No Comet, nor commixed Meteor: A starre of purpose made, of purpose sent, The like was neuer since, nor yet before. By it the Gentiles first to Christ were guided, As God in his deepe wisedome had prouided. 77 The Wise men or Magi. Matth. 2.These Gentiles were not of a meane condition, Wise-men in th' holy storie they be nam'd: Some call them Kings. I like that exposition, See Clas. 1. Stan. 210.And say those Doctors ought not to be blam'd. For in those times, and in those Easterne parts, Kings were well learn'd, and skilfull in hid arts. 78 It's likewise held, they were in number three, So is it by their three-fold gifts imply'de: But, by what meanes of Colein they should bee, Some men in no wise will be satisfy'de It is no point of Creede, from whence they came: Sure from the East, the Text affirmes the same. 79 And thither they returned backe againe, Matth. 2. 14. Not by the way through which they past afore: The style of Colein-Kings they did attaine, By after-accident: I say no more. “In things indifferent where faith is free. “We should not striue against Antiquitie. 80 Th' Euangelists, who Christ his storie wrote, Entrie into a discourse of the Genealogie, or Pedigree of Christ. As they were plaine, and simple without glozing: So spake they nought at randon, or by rote, But all t'engender faith, their style composing. No where more care, nor more fidelitie They shew'd, then setting downe his pedigree. 81 The ground and Basis of true faith, was this, To put, in Gods old promise, sure beliefe: Who therein doubted ought, or thought amisse, Could haue no faith: (first failing in the chiefe) As is a house that wanteth it's foundation, So faith that takes not hence her deriuation. 82 Old Abraham receau'd that word of grace, His Sonne, and Grand-childe had the same renew'd: Dauid the King, descending of their race, With cleerer knowledge thereof, was endew'd. So Abraham and Dauid were the Tree, A Branch whereof Messias needes must bee. 83 To giue assurance to our faith herein, And make vs perfect in Christs pedigree: At Abraham and Dauid doth begin Matth. 1. 1. The first, that cites his Genealogie: Shewes vs how Ioseph And legally, from the Royall line. lineally descended, From those good men, with God so highly friended. 84 A question about Ioseph, Christs putatiue father.What need he tell of Iosephs ancestrie? (Some man, perhaps, may aske for his instruction, So may some doe of incredulitie.) I answere both, and with one plaine construction: The Hebrewes in their Genealogies, On womens persons, seldome cast their eyes. 85 Num. 27. &amp; 36.Those people It was so generally; though some particular exceptions may be shewed. vs'd to match within their Tribes, (Iudah therein was more precise then others.) So, while the Fathers linage he describes, It is implyed thereby he tells the Mothers. Ioseph by Law was Christs reputed Sire, To speake of him, the storie did require. 86 See yet, how in this point those Sacred Scribes, (By God, and by his holy Spirit guided.) Luc 3. whereas hee nameth Ioseph, the sonne of Helie: He was not so by Nature, but by Law, in that he was married to Mary, the naturall daughter of Heli.Preuent all cause of doubt. For one describes The Mothers side: (Gods wisedome so prouided!) The Blessed Virgins linage he recounts, And from her Father, vp to Adam mounts. 87 Therein (me thinks) a mysterie I see, That writing of the Mothers parentage, He leades vs vp vnto the high'st degree, And stoppeth not at any middle Age: As Matth. 1. who there begins at Abraham, and no higher. Luke recording the Virgins line, ascendeth vp to Adam. he who did with Abraham begin, Making rehearsall of the Fathers kin. 88 The Promise first in Paradise was giuen, To our great-grandame Eue, who there transgrest: The Virgins pedigree so high-vp-driuen, (Shee Mother of that Seede so highly blest) Shewes this was he, blest sonne of Euahs daughter, So long foretold, though comming so long after. 89 From Patriarks for vertue most renown'd, With God in high esteeme, Christ did descend: So was his stemme from Kings, and Princes crown'd, Though it became farre meaner in the end. For, as the Hebrewes glorie did decline, So fell the Fathers of Messias line. 90 Some blemishes among his Ancestrie, The sacred stories plainly doe set forth: The Kings (most of them) wanted pietie, Some of them Gentiles were, some of small worth. Ruth a Moabite “All Nations, and all men of each condition, “Haue part in Christ; so large is his commission. 91 Who doth not yet admire and much commend, The care and wisedome of the Iewish Nation: That when their state did all to ruine bend, Kept th' ancient custome without alteration? By diligent and heedfull Heraldrie, Noting the Linage of their Ancestrie. 92 Ioseph was poore, and of a simple Trade, His Wife, for wealth, no better stor'd then hee; And yet (it seemes) a Catalogue was made Exact and certaine, of their Ancestrie. From whence those sacred Pen-men had the light, Saint Matthew and Luke. The linage of them both, to tell aright. 93 A noble Science not to be neglected, Of speciall vse in each well ordred State: A digression in prayse of Heraldri or Armorie. To see all men in their degrees respected, (A faire old custome, not deuiz'd of late:) “To teach, that vertue, learning, noble deedes, “Nobilitie in their Possessors breedes. 94 Patrons of mad-brain'd popularitie, Who Order doe despise, and loue Confusion; Whose ayme is all at bestiall communitie, (So to bring in old Chaos in conclusion) These onely loath degrees, and ciuill orders, Nor can endure this Art, within their borders. 95 “A spurre it is to euery high attempt, “To be ennobliz'd with the badge of Honour: “From which reward, no person is exempt, “Whom God will raise: (for hee's the chiefest Donour.) “Where causes doe preceed, there will ensue “Th' effects: Sith God giues euery man his due. 96 2. Sam. 17.When great Goliah Israels Host defi'd, Young Dauid vnder-tooke with him to fight: His zeale to God (that may not be deni'd) Before all worldly motiues, gaue him spright. Vers. 25.Yet Saul propos'd great honour for a pay, To him who could that proud Philistim slay. 97 2. Sam. 23.The worthy men which vnder Dauid sway'd, Are not forgotten in the holy Booke: Their names in order, Herald-like are layd, There shall you finde them, if you list to looke: Their acts rehear'st, that their posteritie, Might follow them, and win like prayse thereby. 98 Ioah amongst them all I faile to find, Great Captaine of the Host, a man of name: He left no worthy memorie behind, By cowardise, his acts he did defame. 2. King. 2. 5.The bloud of warre, in peace he foully shead: Iust vengeance therefore, lighted on his head. 99 Two of his brothers in the list are nam'd, Farre lesse then he in ranke, and estimation: Yet sith he for his vices was defam'd, By law of Armes, he suffred degradation. His coat reuers't, and he in bloud bespotted, His Honour with his Corps together rotted. 100 Though he were sisters sonne vnto the King, 1. Chron. 2. 16. And held a place of Honour with the best: That could not safeguard to his Person bring, Nor cause him be recorded 'mong the rest. “Great men if they with vertues be not furnisht, “By Heralds art, their Armes should not be burnisht. 101 One speciall part of Heraldrie it is, 'Mong sundrie others not to be despiz'd: They teach great Titlers not to claime amisse, Each title at his worth by them is priz'd. “Where Order is obseru'd, Confusion hated, “There Heralds and their skill, are highly rated. 102 Most ancient is the vse of Armorie, The antiquitie of Armorie, or Heraldrie. Gen. 49. I'll looke no higher then the Patriarks: Good Iacob when he was at point to die, (As well it is obseru'd by learned Clarkes) Bequeathed Armes among his sonnes by will, Which to their Tribes are propriated still. 103 The Lion King of Beasts, was Iudahs badge, Consorting well with his Regalitie: He gaue the rest such as with them might fadge, Or best accord to their Posteritie. Each man was bound, vnto his owne Tribes Stander, Numb. 2. And might not thence, vnto another wander. 104 What more should kindle loue, and amitie, (Which in this Iron age begins to freeze) Then doth the bond of Consanguinitie, 'Mong branches sprowting from the selfe-same trees? Or men that by affinitie are ti'de, Although their dwellings be remote, and wide? 105 The times haue beene (those times me thinkes are past, I doubt where ere they will returne againe.) When linkes of bloud, and matches bound men fast: More hard to breake, then was a brasen chaine. Now trifles to the value of a Goose, Or breake the linke, or make it slip, and loose. 106 Our British Nation herein I commend, (How euer some elude it with a scoff) Their kin they are most forward to befriend, And knowledge them, though somewhat farther off. Their Bardi Brittanici. Bardhs record the Genealogies, Aswell of those who fall, as them that rise. 107 Some people after two discents, or three, Haue no regard of kisse, nor yet of kin: Farewell both kinred and affinitie, Vnlesse they hope somewhat thereby to win. If Cousins chance to rise, and grow in fauour, Then kinred with such men, begins to fauour. 108 “Th' abuse, vnto the Art brings no disgrace, “Else might we cauill at the best profession. One circumstance I'll adde vnto this place, And so returne from this my long digression. The matter's such, as need not breed offence, If with the Meeter, you vouchsafe dispence. 109 This Art contaynes some hidden mysteries, (Those Artists treat vpon them in their bookes) Not subiect to the view of vulgar eyes, Shadow'd they are with vailes, and lie in nookes: Their language is by figures, signes, and markes, To Herehalts onely knowne, and to their Clarkes. 110 With metalls, colours, starres, and precious stones, In number nine, ingeniously dispos'd: All coates of Armes in their Escutchiones Are blazon'd: Sundrie shapes therein enclos'd, With differences whereby younger brothers, From elders are discern'd, and each from others. 111 Best coates are so deuiz'd by Heraulds lawes, As on the view, men cunning in that Art, Will yeild a reason, and disclose the cause Of each such coat; and tell for what desart, The Ancestor those ensignes did attayne, Or others after, new atchieuements gayne. 112 A thousand rarities as well as these, To giue instruction, and to breed delight, Those Artists reach: Thence learne them, if you please, Or from the bookes which of this subiect write. Where Honour, still from Vertue is deriu'd, And Vice, of Armes and Honour both, depriu'd. 113 I feare a censure for my ouer-sight, That scarce a prentice in this mysterie, I durst a dittie thereof to indite, And wrong the Art: Peccaui doe I crie. The skill, I see good reason to approue; The ciuill vse thereof, needes must I loue. 114 Looke backe to Stan. 92.Returne my Muse, vnto thy sacred Theame, Messias Birth and Pedigree o're-past: Rowze vp thy selfe, as rays'd out of a dreame; Of that which yet remaynes, let's haue a tast. Declare in order what succeeded next, As thou dost find it in the holy Text. 115 Herod.Then reigned Herod in Ierusalem, The Romanes set the crowne vpon his head: 'Twas not his right, but that it pleased them, So Iudahs Race was dis-inherited. A certaine signe of Christs natiuitie, Gen. 49. 10.As Iacob long before did prophecie. 116 Herod from Iewes had learned by tradition, That out of Iudahs stock a King should rise: Whom they conceau'd must be of high condition, A mightie Prince, on earth to Manarchize: Which strooke into his heart a Panike feare, When first those wise-mens errand he did heare. 117 Matth. 2. 4.The Priests and Scribes together he assembles, To learne the certaine place of Christ his birth: That fully knowne, he cunningly dissembles, Then makes a shew of ioy, and holy mirth: Pretends a pilgrimage, as of deuotion, His heart all bent vpon a wicked motion. 118 He boasts within himselfe for this deuise, Suppos'd he had the Bird fast in his net: It's good (thinkes he) be merry, and yet wise, Now in my Throne I shall be surely set. Mark. 12, 7.I'll kill this Heire, then is the Kingdome mine, When I haue cropt this branch of Iudahs Line. 119 But God, who sees the secrets of the heart, Psal. 139. 1. Who knowes the thoughts long ere they be conceau'd: Preuents the man, for all his cunning Art: The Magi came not back. Thus he deceau'd, With fierce reuenge was wholly set on fire, Nought else but bloud could qualifie his ire. 120 He vs'd those Wise-men onely for a stale, They mocked him, whom he thought to beguile: “So men oft-times are brought vnto their bale, “By plots, which in proiecting make them smile. “A false deceauer (neuer aske him leaue) Fallere fallentem, non est fraus. “Make no great scruple, such one to deceaue. 121 A Woolfe that wendeth to a flock of sheepe, A Simile. Espyes one Lambe, much fairer then the rest: Drawes neere to it (the Shepherd fast a-sleepe) Prepares his panch for this expected feast: But in the nick, when he is readie bite, In runnes the Shepherd, soundly doth him smite. 122 Thus hauing lost his prey, halfe mad with rage, He falleth in vpon another flock: There, his enraged furie to asswage, Among them all, he fiercely makes a shock He stares, and howles all one as he were wood, Then snatches, bites, and kills, and sucks the blood. 123 So, this fell Tyrant fayling in his plot, Much like a mad dogge, ouer-come with rage: In choller and reuenge he waxed hot, Slue all the Children vnder two yeeres age Matth. 3. 16. At Bethlehem, and in the Coast thereby, Which caused many a wofull mothers cry. 124 Ier. 31. 15.Loe, here againe another old prediction, Which by one Prophet, long before was writ: Curs't Infidels esteem'd it as a fiction, This Tyrant vnawares accomplish't it. Matth. 5. 18.“Of all that God fore-spoke, the smallest jot, “In time to be performed, fayleth not. 125 The meanes how Christ escaped Herodes hand, Was not at randon left to Iosephs choise: The Angell bids him flie to Egypt Land, He readily obey'd the heauenly voice. Himselfe, the Childe, and his espoused wife, Dwelt in that Countrey all the Tyrants life. 126 Wherein was hid a double mysterie, By God decreed in his deepe prouidence: Ose. 11. 1.Th' accomplishment of an old prophecie, Which sayes, That God should call his sonne from thence. Each line, nay (neere) each word doth matter giue, To strengthen Faith, and vrge vs to beleeue. 127 It proues againe, though he a Iew were borne, Their rightfull King, to offer them saluation: Yet of the Gentile-people tooke no scorne, But came to call, and saue each heathen Nation. These entertayn'd him better farre, then those: These stood his friends, when th' other prou'd his foes. 128 Herodes most miserable end. Ios. lib. 7. cap. 8.That wicked King, when he had tyranniz'd, And spilt the bloud of harmelesse Innocents: With a disease most lothsome was surpriz'd, Part gnaw'd with wormes, part plagu'd with sundrie torments: A rare example, others to affright; From shedding guiltlesse bloud, by fraud or might. 129 Soon after, Ioseph was recalled home, By him that erst aduised him to flee: But hearing Herods sonne reign'd in his roome, He turn'd aside, and dwelt in Galilee, At Nazareth: whereby it came to passe, Iob. 19 19. That he a Nazarene surnamed was. 130 The storie noteth how that royall Childe, The Sonne of God, not subiect to the Lawes: In humane nature was so meeke and milde, As he obeyed it in euery Clause. Was circumciz'd, call'd by that glorious Name, All peoples knees should bow, who heare the same. Phil. 2. 10. 131 Great reason was't he should be circumciz'd, Why Christ was circumcised. That Rite by no meanes, might haue beene neglected: Else had the Iewes at first beene scandaliz'd, The Law of Moses seem'd t'haue beene reiected. Meet was it he should all the Law obay, Ere to the Gospell he could make cleere way. 132 It proues, his flesh was not phantasticall, As Manichæus dotingly did dreame: But as his Mothers true, substantiall, From which (like other mens) pure bloud did streame. This Act affirmed his Humanitie, As did his Actions, his Diuinitie. 133 Long after this, it pleas'd him be baptiz'd, Christ baptized. To giue allowance to that sacred Rite: He needed not (Saint Iohn was well aduiz'd) Matth. 3. 14. Sith free from sinne, he had no cleansing b'it That precious badge of Christianitie, The more to pri'ze, he taught his Church thereby. 134 The holy Ghost on him descended. Luc. 3. 21.This holy Sacrament no sooner ended, A full assembly standing in the place: The Holy Spirit like a Doue descended, His Person and that Rite, the more to grace. A voice from heauen then gaue testimonie, And witnesse bore of his Diuinitie. 135 He is presented in the Temple.Before he ouer-past his Infancie, And from his Parents tutelage was freed: Vnto the Lord, presented must hee bee, Leu. 12. 6.An offring for him made, as Law decreed. Whilst in the Temple this was to be done, Another thing worth noting, there begunne. 136 Simeon. Luc. 2. 25. Old Simeon, a iust man and deuout, Full with the holy Ghost replenished: Of that Messias comming made no doubt, Was by diuine instinct admonished, That death his aged limmes should not surprize; Till first he should behold Christ with his eyes. 137 He comes into the Temple, not by hap, But guided by Gods prouidence diuine: The Childe within his armes he there doth wrap, Him steadily beholding with his eyne: First prayseth God, then chaunteth Nunc dimittis, The short'st, and sweet'st, among all sacred Ditties. 138 His sweet song called Nuns diminis.Now Lord giue leaue thy Seruant may depart, Sith that mine eyes Worlds-Sauiour doe behold: Whom thou hast sent, the Gentiles to conuert, Thy Isr'els ioy, as thou before had'st told, This said, the Parents, and the Childe doth blesse, Of things to come, fore-shewes them the successe. 139 The last that beareth witnesse 'mong the rest, Anna, her testimonie of Christ. Luc 2. 36. Addes her faire Suffrage, with that holy Crue: A woman, for her prayses not the least, (That giues assurance what shee spake was true) Eu'n in that instant to the place shee came, And what shee knew of Christ, divulg'd the same. 140 Now Iewes, and Turkes, and vnbeleeuers all, And christ'ned Atheists, (if some such there bee) You neuer read, nor heard, nor neuer shall, The like sweet-sympathizing harmonie, To proue a thing false, feyned and vntrue; Beleeue on him then, bid the Deuill adue. 141 What Prophets old fore-saw, and did fore-tell, What Rites, and Types, and Figures did declare, And Sacrifices vs'd in Israel, With last-recited stories strange and rare: Can all these worke no sound beliefe in you, Nor credit gayne, to things so certaine true? 142 The Deuill doth beleeue the sacred Text, Iam. 2. 19. The Deuills beleeue, and tremble. And knowes 'tis true; it makes him more to tremble: With knowledge of that Truth, hee's euer vext. To whom then may I Infidels resemble? In vnbeliefe, their master they exceede: And hold some points, worse then the Deuils creede. 143 How could so many Witnesses conspire, And ioyne their heads, a storie to deuize? Poore Shepherds counterfeit that heau'nly Quire, Gull all that Countrey, with a forg'd surmize? Or draw great Princes from a Countrey farre? The Magi. Or make an admirable walking Starre? 144 Could poore old Ioseph with his tender wife, Haue scap't the bloudie tyrant Herods hand? Had he the skill to saue the Infants life From slaughter, 'mongst those children of the land? But that some higher Power did him guide, And warned him in time to slip aside. 145 These things were not in hidden corners done, Then set abroach in certaine Ages after: They were divulged iust as they begunne, With wonderment receau'd, not scorn'd with laughter. Great Heathen clerkes doe iustifie the storie, Though to impugne the Faith, they take a glorie. 146 We neede no credit begge from Heathen bookes, Nor from the Eluish Sybills fopperies: Who on the sacred Text with iudgement lookes, Compares with heed, the holy Prophecies: Shall finde enough therein beliefe to gaine, And craue no helpe from sutt'lest worldly braine. 147 O silly fooles, what makes you shut your eyes, And scorne to heare that God who doth you call Surcease the Sacred Storie to despise, Lay hold (at first) on faith historicall: That had, you may proceed and grow in grace, Without the first, for th' other there's no place. 148 A digression in defence of Poesie, in Diuinitie.Here leaue I vnbeleeuers for awhiles, And grant my Muse a little time to wander: To lighten and refresh her selfe with smiles, Halfe dull'd, and maz'd within this close meander. So, when her sprights fresh vigour shall regaine, Shee hopes to win your soules, and quit her paine. 149 A man that sets himselfe vpon the Stage, A Simile. Becomes the obiect of all peoples eyes: (Especially in this fault-finding Age) Or must the censures of the most despise: Or beare himselfe all steadily vpright, Else some will at him barke, and some will bite. 150 I run the common hazard in this case, My Muse vpon a high Theater stands: Though shee behold none with a churlish face, Nor quarrelsome with any faction bands: Yet lookes shee not to 'scape without some touch, Shee armes her selfe, sith thee expects as much. 151 What meanes this man (me thinkes I heare one aske) Obiections against the vse of Poesie, in Diuinitie. These sacred Mysteries so much to wrong? What moues him vndertake so rare a taske, To binde this heauenly subiect, to a song? This Poetrie beseemes a meaner matter, It is no Theame, whereon a chough should chatter. 152 Let learned Doctors in the Tongues well-skill'd, In looser lines, not bound to feet and measure, Doe all they can: when they their bookes haue fill'd, With choisest portions of so rich a treasure: They faile oft-times to tell their mindes so cleare, But doubts, and scruples therein doe appeare. 153 Hence spring new questions in Diuinitie, Lesse reuerence giuen to the holy Word: When men, no Clerkes, but of the Laytie, Presume to take in hand the sp'rituall Sword. Such matters must be left to reuerend Clarkes, To be discussed in their learned warkes. 154 At least, they'll not endure a Poets quill, Should scribble on this Theame with Lyrike layes: This learning comes not from Parnassus Hill, Her Doctors temples weare no crownes of bayes. Take Poets, obiects fit for poetrie: And Clericks, subiects of Theologie. 155 The Muses indicted, and arraigned.Yee charming Sisters, who in Thessalie, Were wont, long since, to hold your residence: Betweene huge Ossa and Olympus high, And take those shadie woods for your defence: To tread the flowrie bankes of Peneus side, Whose siluer streames by Helicon doe glide. 156 Where antique Altar of that Idoll Ioue, With lothsome heath'nish fumes too oft did smoake: When Paynims sacrific'd in euery Groue, Idolatrie did with deuotion cloake: You, with such treasons in old times acquainted, 'Gainst heauens King: and for that fact attainted. 157 What makes you on this Princes Court encroach, Whence many Ages since, yee were exil'd? How durst you be so bold as to approach His sacred Cabinet, yee Traytors vild? You stand indicted of this treason high, Now answere for your selues, Who shall you trie? 158 The Obiections answered, &amp; Indictment trauerst: with a digression in defence of Poesie.An innocent vnwares may be indicted, Yet to his trauerse being once admitted: His Allegations heard, he may be righted, And by a Iurie on their oathes, acquitted. My Muse vpon the Quest doth put her Cause, And prayes the Court, to iudge her by the Lawes. 159 From vulgars censures, first shee doth appeale; Submits her selfe most gladly to the rest: Yet, 'mongst them all who in such pleas doe deale, Shee humbly prayes the iudgement of the best. Before his Throne shee kneeles, her doome to heare, Her conscience her assures, shee need not feare. 160 That old Indictment, long since was reuerst, Reade to this purpose in the authors, Beati Pacifici, Stan. 146. A generall gracious pardon freely past: The Charter hath beene sundrie times rehearst, Beene oft allow'd, and euer is to last. Th' aduantage of that pardon I entreate, For faults that doe precede the same in date. 161 “Sonnes must not suffer, for their fathers crimes, “(Nor daughters for th' offences of their mothers) Convict me by the errours of my Rimes, And not for treasons done long since by others. If in themselues no wickednesse appeare, Giue sentence on my side, and set me cleare. 162 Tell me what tongue, or language vnder skie, 'Mongst men in life, and faith most reprobate. But may be well apply'de to pietie, And fit the mouthes of men regenerate? “An earthen vessell may pure liquor hold, “As well as one of siluer, or of gold. 163 If then all tongues, may talke of things diuine, The myst'ries not disparaged thereby: Why should a strict-smooth-footed Poets line, Doe worse, then wordes left loose at libertie? “The forme of speech, ought not chaste eares offend, “So as with zeale, to pietie it tend. 164 “A modest Poem beares with it a grace, “And slily steales into the hearers heart: “Among the grauest Clerkes deserues a place, “In passages diuine, may beare a part. “The sacred Text is not prophan'd by meeter, “By it, the matter rather seemes the sweeter. 165 The Muses are not fett'red to Pernassus, Nor sworne alone to drinke of Helicon: (Like him who sits fast chain'd on Caucasus.) They haue, and doe hold residence at Sion: And taste the streames of Sabrine, Thames, or Wie, Aswell as any Spring in Thessalie. 166 Iudg. 12. 6.Sith Shibboleth they can pronounce aright, Though Ephramites by birth, and parentage: Yee Gileadites doe not against them fight, Nor seeke to kill these sisters in your rage. They bring their offrings to Ierusalem, They are at peace with you, warre not with them. 167 Thou princely Iudge, before whose sacred Seate, Mine, and my sisters cause, I humbly pleade: Thy pardon and thy patience I entreate, To speake at large, as matter shall me leade. A pris'ner for his life hath libertie, (With reuerence of the Court) to argue free. 168 Of such as doe our innocence oppose, Some few (perhaps) by euill will are led: With silence onely will I answere those, That's antidote for tongues enuenomed. Such accusations slender credit gaine, The Courts of Iustice, reckon them but vaine. 169 It's Ignorance, Arts greatest enemie, Scientia non habetinimicum, praterignorantiam. That sets it selfe, the Muses to out-face: They vnderstand not what is poesie, Who most oppugne, and striue it to disgrace. I'll teach them if they haue a lust to learne, The Truth (herein) from errour to discerne. 170 So when they shall be able iudge aright, And cleerly see wherein before they err'd: In quarrell of the Muses they will fight, And ioy, to see their Schollers be preferr'd. They'll giue them leaue, the grauest theames to handle, And on their knees, the gentle Sisters dandle. 171 A Poet is a Maker by his name, A Poet by signification of the word, is a Maker: and Poesie, is making. And Poesie, a making doth imply: The first of Writers that deserued fame, (Among Professors in humanitie) Were Poets all; who by their sweetned straines, First stamp't Arts image, in mens duller braines. 172 Was't not by Poets learned skill and wit, That men in manners rude, much like to beasts: In concord and societie were knit, Did freely yeild themselues t'obey Lawes hests? Antiquitie to them that honour left, To rob them of it, were a kinde of theft. 173 Such sight in things Diuine as Heathens had, Or fauour'd ought of thoughts celestiall: In Poets habits all were neatly clad, Set forth in shapes, and shewes poeticall. Their styles were Sacred, Holy, and Diuine, Sacri, Sancti, Diuini. The dearest Darlings of the Sisters nine. 174 Their skill may not be got by institution, Nemo sie, sed nascitur Poeta.Not Art, but Nature must a Poet frame: 'Twas euer held, their cunning came b'infusion, Vates.Whence Elders gaue to them, a Prophets name. Furor Poeticus.Instinct and Furie must possesse their braine, That shall the title of a Poet gaine. 175 Their pen to one sole subiect is not bound, What euer falls within the reach of wit, Conceit, or Reason: Shallow, or Profound, From Shepherds poore, to Kings that crowned sit: Things Sacred or Profane, or Lowe or Hie, Are subiects fit, for Poets ingenie. 176 “To euery person, and in euery thing, “It keepes decorum. Vertue best is graced “By poesie, when Poets thereof sing: “So, by their poems, Vice is most defaced. All Sciences within it are contayn'd: Why should this Art of Arts, be so disdayn'd? 177 Of heauenly songs (the branch of poesie Whereof I treat, and seeke to make defence) Examples in the sacred Historie May be alleag'd, I hope without offence. Yet all herein that shall be spoke, or writ, To Churches censure, wholly I submit. 178 Sundrie sorts of songs in Scripture. First, for deliuerance from preat dangers Moses. Exod. 15.A song of prayse for strange deliuerance, Moses and Isr'el to the Lord did sing: The Women musick made, and led a dance, With pious mirth, to honour heauens King. May not like cause now, worke the like effect? Such, as say no, I'll not be of their sect. 179 Many such songs vpon the like occasion, Psal. 18. &amp; 105. Dauid. Did holy Dauid seriously endite: Needes must it be confest without euasion, He did it by th' instinct of th' holy Sprite. On sundrie instances I'll not insist, More in his Psalmes you may reade, if you list. 180 That noble prophetesse good Debora, Iudg. 5. Debora. Who boldly put her person to the field: After the full defeate of Sisera, By singing, prayses to her God did yeild. The children saued from the fierie flame, The three children in the fiery Ouen. Did chaunt a song, in honour of Gods name. 181 For blessings and Gods benefits receau'd, Secondly, for benefits and blessings receaued. Good men and women, holy songs oft fram'd: More then they all (if I be not deceau'd) We finde in that good King, but lately nam'd: Of Israel, sweet singer might hee bee, 2. Sam. 23. None sang so much, nor yet so sweet as hee. 182 When barren Hannah had a sonne obtayn'd, 1. Sam. 1 Hannah. (Oft vexed with her Riualls iniurie) For whom shee pray'd, and wept with teares vnfayn'd: To render God her best gratuitie, A song shee fram'd with gracefull melodie, Full fraught with flowr's of heauenly poesie. 183 Of loue chaste, holy, spirituall and diuine, Thirdly, songs of spirituall loue, betwixt Christ and his Church. Reade all Solomons Canticles. A Song of Songs King Solomon indited: Looke on the in-side, not the outward rine, Thy heart with heauenly mirth will be delighted: To see the enterchange of mutuall loue, Betwixt Christ and the Church, his gentle Doue. 184 How shee her selfe before him doth abase, Vnworthy to be matcht with such a mate: Deformitures in feature, and in face Acknowledgeth: And at how lowe a rate, Her selfe and all her parts, shee doth esteeme, That in his loue, more happy shee might seeme. 185 How he againe, her beautie doth admire, And limns it with a grace vnimitable: Embraceth her with loue all set on fire, Makes her by his rich gifts, more amiable. With wordes and art, meerly poeticall, And emphasis super-celestiall. 186 Fourthly songs for remembrancers, and admonition. Deut. 31. 19. &amp; 32. 1.When Moses was to take his last farewell, And seize Mount Nebo for his sepulture: Fore-seeing that back-sliding Israel, Sound in Gods seruice, would not long endure, But bow to Idolls of all bord'ring Nations, And sute their manners, to those Heath'nish fashions. 187 To testifie against such haynous crimes, And make them heedfull of this prophecie: That they might call to minde the ancient times, Ere they declyn'd to grosse Idolatrie: By Gods expresse command, a song he wrote, For them and theirs to know, and learne by rote. 188 Fiftly, songs for spirituall comfort, deuotion and edification. Colos 3. 16 &amp; Ephes. 5. 19.Some vses more of Songs, and Hymnes, and Psalmes, In sacred Writ expressed doe I finde: They serue to wounded soules, for precious balmes, To ease the heart, and to reioyce the minde. Fit meanes they are, to stirre vp true deuotion, Proceeding euer from an holy motion. 189 The care King Dauid had in this respect, 1. Chron. 16. &amp; 25. To beautifie Gods seruice in those dayes: May warrant vs, not wholly to reiect, That thing which he ordayned to Gods prayse. Though God seeke inward worship of the heart, Fit outward helpes must not be laid apart. 190 When Christians in their Temples doe assemble, In holy Hymnes, with heart and voyce agree: The glorious Quire of Angels they resemble, And pierce the heauens with their melodie. Herein the Church while shee is militant, Participateth with the Church triumphant. 191 The choisest songs to Christ his birth addrest, See before Magnificat, the Angels song, Benedictus, and Nunc dimittis. Alreadie haue beene offered to your view: You see what in the old-writ was exprest, Is likewise vs'd, and taught vs in the new. Condemne not that, which rightly may be vs'd, But onely see, the same be not abus'd. 192 That Christ our Lord did laugh, I neuer read, There's no such mention in the Historie: A Psalme or Hymne he sang, so is it said. Mar. 14. 26: His sole example serues the turne, say I. “Each Act of his (as may be prou'd b'induction.) “Is written, and doth serue for our instruction. 193 Haue not some godly Fathers in their time, Saint Athanasius his profound Creede, called Quicunq vult. And Saint Ambrose his diuine Te Deum, &amp;c. Made songs: wherein our faiths deepe mysteries, Are chaunted out in soule-delighting rime, No good men grudging at those melodies? If such high points are sung without offence, Why may not others, with like reuerence? 194 All Ages such examples doe afford, To iustifie this gracefull exercise, In poetizing on the Sacred Word. One sample will I set before your eyes: Of late-ones he shall serue for all the rest, 'Mong sacred Poets, held to be the best. 195 Du Bartas his diuine Weeks.He that by weekes and dayes his worke diuides, First on the worlds-creation poetizeth: Then forwards to succeeding Ages slides, The choisest matters in his Verse compriseth, Of elder Text: so sweetly beautify'de, As, with instruction, yeilds content beside. 196 “What brings delight, and profit both together, “That more in reason ought we to respect: “Then it, which singlely produceth either. “This is of poesie the true effect, “To make those pathes soft, easie, smooth and plaine, “Which in themselues are rough, and full of paine. 197 Of poesie in numbred wordes, and measure, And sweet-concluding-clozes I intend: (I know, a Poets pen can range at pleasure, Prose-poetrie it's easie to defend) That charming Verse, which endeth in a rime, The thing by some, much scorned in this time. 198 Ios lib. 1. de Ant. Iud. cap. 7. saith, that Moses after their deliuerie from the Egyptians, made an Ode or song in hexameter verse. See also l. 4. c. 8.I dare not say, the ancient Hebrewes songs, Ran all in rime: it goes beyond my skill. To greater Clerkes, such knowledge deepe belongs: Yet as I said before, so say I still; They kept both order, number, time, and measure: It stood so with deuotion, and with pleasure. 199 “These Rimes which to the matter doe no wrong, “Yet by the eare, breede in the heart delight: “Ought not be lashed with a lauish tongue, “Giue them, as vnto looser lines, their right. If th' onely Rime offend, the wordes transmute, It will be Prose, and with your fancie sute. 200 Thankes to the soueraigne Iudge with reuerence: Conclusion of the defence of Poesie. Next, to the Court, where Iustice holds her seate, For granting pris'ners this faire audience. No further fauour need I to entreate. I ghesse, the Verdict must be speciall, A Terme or two, will shew what shall befall. 201 But thou my Muse, who with thy oaten quill, Presum'st to pipe these homely rustick Layes: Whilst some with siluer-sounding trumpets shrill, Transcend Olympus, grac't with wreathes of Bayes: Confesse thy slender skill in poesie, Though thou the Art it selfe doe iustifie. 202 Suffice it thee, that on these sacred Theames, Thou tell thy minde in Meeter smooth, and plaine Let others follow phantasies, and dreames, Speake thou the truth, regard no fables vaine. What some affect, for idle ostentation, Doe thou reiect, and choose humiliation. 203 Let tongue-prooffe armour, gentle patience, Make thee secure: thereon set vp thy rest. A wall of brasse, to wit cleere conscience Keepes thee, and this thy Embrion in rest.

The end of the second Classis. The third Classis. THE ARGVMENT. Christs Miracles on Lazars, Lepers, Blinde, Dumbe, Deafe, Dead, wretched men possest with Deuills Th' Apostles no lesse powrefull in that kinde, By his commission vanquish all those euills. The strange encrease of pious Christianisme, The vnlike growth of hell-bred Mah'metisme. 1 Who pennes the storie of an earthly King, A comparison vsed by the Author ere hee begin to treat of any the Acts of Christ that Messias, and King of Kings. Whose deeds aske folio-Volumes large &amp; thick: Ere of his Acts and Gests he fall to sing, Or come to touch the Matter to the quick: To times, and things preceding must looke back, Else shall his writings grace and lustre lacke. 2 Of all the Kings that euer Scepter sway'd, Since Nimrod first that Title did attaine: Gen. 10. If all their doings were together layd, And Kingdomes ioyn'd, wherein they all did raigne: Their states and stories no wayes might compare With Israels King, nor clayme therein a share. 3 My Muse (like Dogges that running lap and taste. Of Nilus streames, to quench their raging thirst) Some passages hath posted o're in haste From Eden, where shee set her foot at first, Through hills, and dales, and woods, &amp; champion fields, Which endlesse matter of discoursing yeilds. 4 Yet shee, too weake for such a worke of wonder, (What Atlas can so huge a weight sustaine!) Resolu'd, part of that burthen to goe-vnder, Which though it put her to no little paine: Her zeale to doe that King true vassallage, Makes it seeme but an easie carriage. 5 The Author prayeth for diuine assistance.Dread soueraigne King of Kings, stretch forth thy hand, To stay thy feeble seruant least he fall: Enlighten him, that he may vnderstand, Those secrets of thy Court he deales withall: Not prie into thy inner Cabinet, But walke within the bounds which thou hast set. 6 The Sea is deepe, no bottome to be found, Where thou thy greatest mysteries hast hid: Yet may we wade, whilst we can touch the ground, Keepe by the shore, not venter to the mid. Here little Lambes may sip, and quench their thirst, Stout Elephants swill deepe, vntill they burst. 7 From prophesies of Messias, promises and figures of the old Law: And other testimonies in and at his birth, and infancie:With whom predictions of the Prophets old, Nor types and figures, better things resembling; Nor Gods sure promises fairely enroll'd By faithfull Scribes, that neuer vs'd dissembling: Nor witnesses 'boue all exceptions iust, Can worke beliefe, and driue away distrust: 8 A passage to the Acts of Christ himselfe. Heb. 1.For such, some easier arguments there bee, (The future subiect of my plaine-tune-song) By which the simplest sort may cleerly see; The things that were fore-spoken off so long; And get soule-sauing faith, that's neuer idle, A spurre to Vertue giues, to Vice a bridle. 9 Like one, who in a spacious garden set, A Simile. With flowers, and fruits of sundrie sorts repleat: Hath libertie without controll or let, To take his choise for sauour, or for meat: Lookes oft about, not knowing where begin, All is so faire in shew, so sweet within. 10 So I, amid a Sea and World of matter, Exposed to my choise whereon to sing: Where no man need to gloze, much lesse to flatter, But smoothly say the truth in euery thing: Confounded with my Theames varietie, Stand doubtfull where begin my poesie. 11 Thus wondring at this wondrous affluence, First, of his Miracles. As I my pen vnto my paper set: It seem'd some hid celestiall influence My wau'ring hand, and purpose did abet, And mou'd me first dispose my selfe to treat, Christs Miracles, and workes of wonder great. 12 'Twas meet that he who brought new Doctrine in, Christs doctrine at first required Miracles. Put end vnto old Iewish ceremonies, With Miracles and wonders should begin: Such wondrous workes perform'd before mens eyes, Iob. 5. 36. &amp; 10. 37. Confirm'd his Doctrine with strong euidence, As none thereat could iustly take offence. 13 The first, is one among them not the least, His profound arguing with Doctors, at twelue yeeres old, was wonderfull: if not precisely a miracle. Luk. 2. 49. That he, a childe of young and tender yeeres, Eu'n in the Temple, at a solemne feast, Appos'd profoundest Doctors of the Chaires: His knowledge and his answeres were so rare, As all men wondred, who then present were. 14 Yet, by degrees he grew vnto perfection, Uers. 40.In grace and wisedome daily did encrease: As man, we reade he liu'd in some subiection To passions: Onely sinne could not him seaze. His God-head in his wonders did appeare; So, of his Man-hood he left tokens cleare. 15 His turning water into wine. Iob. 2.In Galile (next) at a marriage feast, His mother and disciples comming thither, Himselfe likewise a solemne bidden ghest, And many more assembling there together: He gaue a probat of his pow'r diuine, By turning Water into perfect Wine. 16 Gen. 2. 22.When Adam stood in state of innocence, In Paradise God knit that sacred band, With breach whereof no mortall may dispence, He brought the Woman to the husbands hand. A mysterie, more to be had in honour, Sith of the first Wife, God himselfe was donour. 17 Perhaps from truth I shall not goe astray, Nor wrong the holy Text by misconstruction: If, as I thinke, so I presume to say, That Christ herein respected our instruction: This was properly, precisely and punctually his first miracle.By his first miracle at a marriage-dinner, To grace that Rite, whereof God was beginner. 18 He left a patterne of ciuilitie, To such as should his holy Faith embrace: To shun all churlish harsh rusticitie, And frame themselues to persons, time, and place: Rom. 12. 15.To feast sometimes with friends, at seasons fit; And sometimes weepe, with such as mourning sit. 19 “No men on earth haue Angell-like perfection, “Whilst we are clothed with mortalitie, “To humane passions we liue in subiection, “None is exempt from mutabilitie. “We laugh, we weepe, are sick, recouer health, “From pouertie, sometimes rise vp to wealth. 20 As Christ made merrie with his friends at feasting, His miraculous fasting fortie dayes. Matth. 4. It's likewise in the holy Storie noted: He soone retyr'd, and gaue himselfe to fasting, A worke whereto he chiefly was deuoted. The Deuill then beginneth him to trie, And takes aduantage of necessitie. 21 Full fortie dayes he spent in meditation, (He was not idle in the Wildernesse) In which he tooke no food for sustentation: This worke, his God-head makes vs to confesse. His hunger after that, doth testifie, And giue sure proofe of his Humanitie. 22 Hence that Old Serpent, subtle sophister, The Deuils first temptation on our Sauiour. Begins to argue thus: Bread here is none: That (as thou know'st) is life's chiefe nourisher: Loe, here is matter, Take to thee this stone, If thou wilt proue thy selfe to be Gods sonne, Command it to be bread, and 'twill be done. 23 He had not yet forgot, how simple Eue By faire pretence, was foully circumuented: So hoped he our Sauiour to deceaue, And make him yeild assoone as he was tempted. His wiles in tempting Christ, were farre more slie, They made no shew of grosse impietie. 24 The woman did what flatly was forbidden, From due obedience to rebellion slided: Foule gluttonie within her brest lay hidden, By sight, and taste her appetite shee guided. Gen. 3. 6.Because the fruit was pleasant to the eye, And good to eate, shee tooke it instantly. 25 One motiue, worse then th' other two beside, Preuaill'd with her. A rash, and damn'd desire Of knowledge like to God. Loe, here was pride, A sinne that still sets all the world on fire. By pride, rebellion, sensualitie, The Tempter gat on her the victorie. 26 With Christ, more warely he goes to worke. To turne a stone into a piece of bread, A man would thinke no treason here could lurke, And yet our Lord, withstood him to his head: Tells him, that God by's word, and prouidence, Not by sole bread, procures our liues defence. 27 Th' audacious boldnesse of the wicked fiend Sets out it selfe, that being once repell'd, He durst his wit against our Sauiour bend: The more he was kept downe, the more he swell'd. For, hauing failed in his first assay, He leaues not so, but tries another way. 28 The Deuils second temptation.He lifts him vp vpon the Temples top, A place of danger, rashly to descend: Anon perswades him, boldly thence to hop, On confidence that God would him defend: Matth. 4. 6.And for assurance, Scripture he produceth, Though (like himselfe) the Text there he abuseth. 29 “The Deuill, when he leades a man to sinne, “Seekes not t'obtayne his full designe at first: “With slender slips, and errors hee'll beginne, “Then drawes him on, to actions more accurst. “For, he that to his first assault giues way, “At next will be more readie to obay. 30 One other gilded bait this Tempter sets, The third temptation. (With such too many in these dayes are caught) Him to a huge high Mountaynes top he gets, Thence shewes him all the world with glorie fraught, And offers all, so he might be ador'd: But then he was rebuked by our Lord. 31 Marke well, to euery point of this temptation, Note the manner of Christs answeres to the Tempter. How Christ still answered with a scriptum est: The Deuill once spake so in altercation, Of him his Schollers learne the Text to wrest: Christ teacheth vs whereon our faith to ground, And how all deuillish wranglers to confound. 32 Though Moses did endure so long a fast, The oddes betweene the fasts of Moses and Eliah, and that of Christ. Exod. 34. 28. Cap. 24. 16, 17, 18. While in the holy Mount he did abide: Gods presence was to him a full repast, He needed not some sustenance beside. Eu'n in the clowd that time with God he dwelt, No touch of humane frailtie there he felt. 33 Eliah tasted of a heauenly meate, 1. King. 19. 6, 7, 8. Ordayned for the nonce to giue him strength: An Angell set it downe, and bid him eate, For-cause he had a iourney of great length: This was a meane of good Eliahs fasting, The Angels foode had such a force of lasting. 34 Gen. 3. 22.And why not so? Farre stranger was that tree, Whose fruit once eaten, had so strong a force; The Eater, from diseases had beene free, His body neuer should beene made a coarse. Then maruaile not, if for some fortie dayes, One Angell-meale the Prophets stomack stayes. 35 Of Christ his fast, no meane at all I see, But onely that he did performe the deed; His Manhood strengthned by his Deitie, Of secundarie causes had no need. 'Twas God that fasted: so communitie Of properties, that speech doth iustifie. 36 Matth. 4. 23.In Galile where he began his preaching, His miracles aboundantly he wrought: By them he wan assent vnto his teaching, More Auditors to him thereby were brought. All people that were any wayes diseased, He made them sound, and left them wholly eased. 37 No sore, no sicknesse came to him amisse, He healed all, and euery kinde of griefe: A leprosie (what spot more loathsome is?) His curing a leprosie. Matth. 8. 2.He cured with his word: 'twas short and briefe. Be cleane, such is my will thou shouldest bee; The griefe departed, and the man was free. 38 His cure of palseyes. Matth. 8. 2. &amp; 9. 1.Two more he cur'd, with palsies much tormented, His word alone he vsed for their ayde: The one, before him neuer was conuented, Onely on his behalfe his Master pray'd: Goe home (saith Christ) thy seruant shall doe well, If thou beleeue: and iust so it befell. 39 A feuer by a touch he did expell, Curing a feuer. Matth. 8. 14. Uers. 25. Rebukes the windes, they instantly obay'd; Becalmes the Seas which mightily did swell, Whereat his faint Disciples were dismay'd. Be still (said he) 'twas calme eu'n as he spake; They all with feare, and wonder 'gan to quake. Mar. 4. 41. 40 “He onely is the Lord of Sea and Land, “He holds the windes fast closed in his fist: “He hath both waues, and blasts at his command, “He makes them stirre, and stayes them when he list. “Of him they stand in awe, and feare his check, “When most thy striue, he stills them with a beck. 41 To him the Sea is as the firmest ground, He walketh on the sea. Matth. 14. Thereon he walkes, makes Peter doe likewise: Who waxed faint, and feared to be drown'd, When he perceau'd a tempest to arise. “Needs must they sinke, whom Christ doth not sustaine, “The helpe of others, we implore in vaine. 42 Two men, who were depriued of their sight, His healing the blinde. Matth. 9. 27. (When of their faith they first had made confession) He toucht their eyes, that they mought see the light, Yet 'twas to take effect vpon condition, So their beliefe were heartie, and vyfayn'd: Which soone appear'd, in that their sight they gayn'd. 43 Another, noted to be blinde by birth, Iob. 9. reade all this Chapter. 'Bout whom the Iewes vs'd many captious questions: He spat, and made a temper of the earth, 'Mongst them it caused many nice suggestions: They labour'd much this wonder to deface, Their stirring gate to Christ and it, more grace. 44 A Simile.As one, who seekes to quench a fire begun, Bestirres himselfe with what comes next to hand: Then to some vessell hastily doth run, Takes vp a pot of oile which there did stand, Throwes it thereon, in hope the flame to smother, But then each little flame, begets three other: 45 So they halfe mad; that wonder to disgrace, (At least, thereof to stop the spreading fame) Run vp and downe, and walke from place to place, One while the man, then they his parents blame: Vers. 34.The Deed at length confirm'd, and clear'd from doubt, They curse the late-blinde man, and cast him out. 46 Deafe and dumbe cured. Matth 9. 32. and Mark 7. 32. and 3.The deafe and dumbe, he made to heare and speake, Limmes withred vp, to strength he did restore: By meanes in seeming simple, feeble, weake, Which caus'd all men thereat to wonder more. What euer meanes he pleased to apply, His will alone, was th' onely remedy. 47 A creeple of thirtie eight yeeres, healed. Iob. 5.One creeple noted more then all the rest, Poore impotent, full thirtie yeeres and eight; His strength regayned when he hoped least, At that strange Poole, where he so long did wait: That helpe which by the Poole he could not haue, Christ with his onely word vnto him gaue. 48 His miraculous feeding 5000. men with eigh: loaues, and two fishes. Iob. 6.Who euer with such slender store of bread, As fiue poore barley loaues, and two small fishes: Hath read, or heard fiue thousand men full fed, Whose stomacks might haue askt a thousand dishes? They all were fill'd, and after meale left more, Then what to them presented was before. 49 One other meale, much like vnto the last, 4000. men, besides women and children, fed with seuen loaues. Matth. 15. To men, their wiues and children did he make: With little food, he gaue them large repast. Then they who sawe these workes, precisely spake That this was he, expected for so long; (Diuine-sweet subiect of my simple song.) 50 Herein was neere resemblance with Creation, No man did so in former time, nor since: Admit therein but multiplication, It giues full proofe of his Omnipotence. To make huge matter out of little store, All's one, as if there had beene none afore. 51 These workes were strange; Farre stranger rest vntold, The like were neuer since, nor yet before: Consuming griefes, long-lingering and old, Matth 9. 20. &amp; Mar. 5. 25. By touching of his garment, and no more. To vanish in a moment, and depart, Not eas'd, but waxing worse by physicks art. 52 Yet, all diseases, griefes, and maladies His reuiuing the dead. Exceeding physicks skill, and surgerie, May not be thought so farre past remedies As death, attendant on mortalitie. When once the thred of life is cut in twaine, God, and no Man, can fasten it againe. 53 This Sonne of God, both God and Man together, Like pow'r had ouer death, as on diseases: He conquer'd th' one, aswell as cur'd the other, With's Word, or lesse then that, doth what him pleases. He could assoone make any dead man liue, As health vnto diseased persons giue. 54 Iarcus his daughter. Marc. 5.When first he came vnto the Rulers daughter, (Her fathers humble suit him thither led) The people there began to raise a laughter, In that they knew, the Maide was fully dead. He takes her by the hand, bids her arise, Shee walks, and eateth meat before their eyes. 55 The widdowes sonne at Naim Luk. 7. 11.Like deed at Naim, wrought he on another; A dead man carried out vpon a Beere, Who was the onely sonne vnto his mother A widdow, weeping shew'd shee lou'd him deere. Christ tooke compassion, will'd her not to weepe, Then rowz'd her sonne from death, as from a sleepe. 56 These two were strangers, both to him vnknowne, (Respecting passions of humanitie) Lazarus. Iob. 11.A friend and deare acquaintance of his owne, Who dwelt within the towne of Bethanie, Giues greater cause to manifest Gods glorie, Uers. 3As is obserued in the sacred Storie. 57 No miracle in all the holy Booke, So fully is describ'd in euery part: I wish my Reader on that Text to looke, Vers. 45.That deed alone did many Iewes conuert: And he who reading it, rests vn-conuerted, Then any stubborne Iew, is more hard-hearted. 58 Here are cleere signes of Christs humanitie, His loue, his sorrow, witnessed by weeping: Mayne arguments of his Diuinitie, Awaking one, who mortally was sleeping. By natures course, the corps began to stinke, Vers. 39.And so his friends that lou'd him best, did thinke. 59 What though his flesh had beene to dust consum'd, And all his limmes disioynted cleane asunder? His former state he should haue re-assum'd, Had Christ beene pleas'd to shew so rare a wonder. He cry'd alowd, and call'd him by his name, The dead man rose, out of his tombe he came. 60 Why should that Article of our Christen Creed, Which doth assure vs of the Resurrection, (Though Reasons reach in sort it doth exceed) Against beliefe be held a strong obiection? This one example makes the matter plaine, That dead men may rise vp, and liue againe. 61 This deed was done neere to Ierusalem, A great recourse of Iewes then in the place: It shewes, our Lord was willing to win them, At least wise such, in whom was sparke of grace. Great numbers did beleeue; some went their wayes, And told the matter to the Phariseis. 62 Such publike notice of this Act was taken, Uers. 47. That all the Citie therewith gan be troubled, The Priests and Pharisees with feare were shaken: Their malice and their furie both redoubled, Eb. 12. 9, 10, 11. Sith Lazarus caus'd many to belieue, Who knew he had beene dead, and sawe him liue. 63 O faithlesse Iewes, most vnbeleeuing Nation, A zealous prayer of the Author. What madnesse did your crazie braines possesse! Hard-hearted, stubborne, froward Generation, Who seeing such great workes, would not confesse! The gangren of your incredulitie, Infecteth yet your whole posteritie. 64 Thou soules and bodies Surgeon and Physition, Haue pitie on this braine-sick, frantick crue: Prepare some strong-soule-curing composition, Vouchsafe their drowsie spirits to renewe: Turne them at last, that they and we together, May knowledge thee coequall with thy Father. 65 And by the working of thy holy Spirit, One God that makes the Glorious Trinitie: Thy heauenly Kingdome we may all inherit, Knit here below in perfect vnitie, In vertue striuing each to passe the other, True Children of thy holy Church, our Mother. 66 Deuills cast out, proue and confesse his Diuinitie.Another proofe of Christs Diuinitie, His greatest foe, the Deuill shall auow: Though wicked men all bent to blasphemie, Him and his workes disgrac't, they car'd not how. Mar. 3. 22.When he the Deuills, by his pow'r o're-came, They said he did it in the Deuills name. 67 Matth. 12. 24.Damn'd blasphemie! Repugnant to all reason, That Satan should against himselfe rebell: Nay, 'mongst those cursed fiends there's no such treason, To mischieue vs, they all agree too well: Their concord (such as 'tis) maintaynes their state, We lose our selues by strife, and mutuall hate. 68 Mar. 9. 25.Sometimes he checks the Deuills with his Word, Commands them to come out, and is obay'd: Luk. 4. 33.Sometimes at very presence of our Lord, Before he speakes, they crie and are afray'd. Matth. 8. 28.They begge his leaue to enter into Swine; What stronger probat of his pow'r diuine? 69 To Iewes and Gentiles he was kind alike, The Syrophenicians daughter. Mar. 7. 25. Lord of them both, in mercy rich to all: One woman who by Nation was a Greeke, Before his feet, most humbly downe did fall: Her daughter from a Deuill he set free, Yet came not neere, nor euer did her see. 70 If all the workes of wonder had beene penn'd, By which our Lord prou'd his Diuinitie: The pen-men hardly could haue found an end, Iob. 20. 30. &amp; 21. 25. They mounted neere vp to infinitie. These were, and are enough to gender faith; So I beleeue, for so the Gospell faith. 71 Some circumstances rest worth obseruation, Whereof my Muse desires a note to warble: The Theame yeilds her such inward contentation, Shee holds it fitter to be grau'n in marble, Then rudely scribb'ld with her ragged quill, Yet hopes, the best may like of her good will. 72 In giuing pow'r to simple Fishermen, Amplification of Christs powerfull Omnipotency: In that he gaue like power to others, to doe such miracles, as himselfe had done. Act. 4. 13. That they like workes should doe, as he had wrought: Most of them wanting skill to hold a pen, Who neuer in their youth to schoole were brought: This was a wonder much admired at, The learned Iewes tooke speciall note of that. 73 Christ, bodies Surgeon, and the soules Physition, Great Lord and King of both by lawfull right: To his Apostles gaue a large Commission, Matth. 10. 1. 8. Against all griefes, and euery vncleane sprite. He bids them heale the sick, make lepers cleane, Cast out the Deuils, raise the dead againe. 74 Much vnlike him of whom it is written, Uendere iure potest, emerat ille prius. Act 3. 6. &amp; 8. 18, 19, 20.Freely they had this gift, payd nothing for it, As freely they bestow'd the same on others. Money or bribes to take, they did abhorre it, But gaue to strangers, as vnto their brothers. This law and practise is grow'n obsolet, Now men must pay, if ought they meane to get. 75 A Simile.While Phœbus shewes his face, it shines so bright, The Moone and lesser Lamps yeild not a sparke: There's no apparance of their borrowed light, Till he withdraw, and it begin grow darke: Then, all such force as he to them doth lend, To serue the vse of man, they freely spend. 76 Another Simile, or Comparison.A King, whilst he is present in the place, And deignes himselfe a bus'nesse to effect: For subiects then to wait, it's no disgrace, Till he be pleas'd, some specially t'elect, And giue them pow'r in those affaires to deale, To trie them trustie, and himselfe to speale, 77 Our Lord, long time in person did attend His Church-affaires, himselfe tooke all the care: He trayn'd some neere about him, to this end When he sawe time, the burthen they might share, And by Commission ample, full and large, Performe what he to them should giue in charge. 78 The Apostles miracles, were arguments of Christs diuinitie, by whose power they did them.Th' Apostles were no slack Commissioners, But roundly let themselues vnto their taske: All people of the world were their Parishioners, They gaue to all, that came to them to aske. By vertue of Christs pow'r to them diriu'd, What e're they tooke in hand, prou'd well, and thriu'd. 79 And first, t'assure them of his powerfull aide, Speaking all languages. Iob. 14. 16. &amp; Act. 2. To warrant them in that so high a function: T'accomplish what not long before he saide, On them he did bestow a sp'rituall vnction. They with the holy Ghost were wholly fill'd, In euery language on a sodaine skill'd. 80 This strange beginning had a faire successe, Saint Peter most diuine sermon. Vers. 11. Though some forbare not, foully to blaspheme: Three thousand soules were gayned, and no lesse By Peters Sermon, grounded on that Theame. Hereby Christs God-head was aswell made knowne, As by the greatest wonders of his owne. 81 What miracles were by th' Apostles showne, Though all the people offred them the honour: Act. 3. 11, 12. and 14. 14. Yet they surrendred it to him alone, Who of their large Commission was the Donour. “The Authour of each worke deserues the prayse, “More then the Instrument, which him obayes. 82 So, what they did as seruants to their Lord, Whence they deriued their authoritie: Among those Acts I iustly may record, Which giue vs proofe of his Diuinitie. By him, and in his Name, their deedes were wrought; Act. 3. 6. and 4. 10. 30. Confest, that of themselues they could doe nought. 83 As when they set the creeple on his feet, Healing a creeple. Act. 3. Who from his birth before could neuer stand, Vntill that Peter friendly did him greet, And gently taking him by his right hand, Bid him rise vp, and walke in Iesus Name: Which said, the creeple was no longer lame. 84 The Iewish Rulers, madded with this deed, And more, in that they did the people teach: Laid hands on them. But marke how it did speed, The Doctrine was so sweet which they did preach, Act. 4. 4.So well confirmed, that fiue thousand more, Were ioyn'd to them, which did beleeue before 85 Me thinkes, it was a miracle to see, How these hard-hearted Rulers beat their braine: To compasse, that the deed conceal'd might bee, Which was so open, manifest, and plaine. Themselues blind-foulded, would haue other men, Seeme not to see, what cleerly they did ken. 86 A Simile.Like children when they hide their eyes, or winke, While they themselues see not the face of others: That no man else sees them (poore soules) they thinke, Thus please their fancie, and delight their mothers. Such was the childish folly of those people, About the bus'nesse of that cured creple. 87 Here Peters loue vnto his Lord appear'd, Iob. 23. 15.Whereof not long before he made profession: The threatnings of the Iewes, he no whit fear'd, Act. 4. 8.But boldly made a most diuine confession: Proues, they had cast aside that Corner-stone, Which all the faithfull should be built vpon. 88 When he and other of his fellowes met, Recounting how the Rulers had them threat'ned: Themselues to pray with one accord they set, Desiring God they might by him be heart'ned, Boldly to preach: and that in Iesus Name, They might worke wonders, so to spread his fame. 89 No sooner had they ended their deuotion, The strange mouing of the place where they prayed. Vers. 31. But instantly the place wherein they sat, Was strangely shaken with a heauenly motion: They courage tooke, and waxed bold thereat, Inspired from aboue, they all agree, Their hearts and soules fast knit in charitie. 90 A King, that seekes his Empire to enlarge, A Comparison. Winnes strangers to acknowledge him their Lord: As well of th' one, as th' other sort takes charge, Like Iustice to them all, he doth afford. One sharpe example shew'd on his owne Nation, Makes strangers loue: and feare like castigation. 91 Some one, who in the Churches bosome lurkes, Who of Religion makes a faire pretence: Corrupts his fellowes with his wicked workes, To Infidels giues scandall, and offence. By cutting off so bad a rotten limme, The body is preserued cleane, and trimme. 92 A scabbed sheepe that would the whole infect, Another Comparison. Good Shepherds vse to draw-out from the rest: The flock, more then one culling, they respect. Th' Apostles, Pastors of all else, the best, With their new chosen sheepe doe so begin, Thereby more loue, and credit did they win. 93 What sinne more haynous in the Church of God The miracle done by Peter on Anantas and his wife. Act. 5. Then Sacriledge? Of all thefts, that's the worst: Such theeues aske scourging with an Iron rod. Of all Church-robbers, he who was the first 'Mong men professing Christ, death was his hire The manner strange, as did the fact require. 94 The man who did commit that robberie, Though 'twere most close, and secret in his heart: No sooner came in Peters companie, But he perceau'd his falshood, and his art: Rebuk't him sharply for his foule dissembling, Downe dead he fell, eu'n at his feet with trembling 95 His wife, partaker in the trecherie, Not knowing what her husband did betyde: Presents her selfe with like impietie, But instantly at Peters word, shee dy'de. These rare examples strake a sodaine feare, In all beleeuers, who thereof did heare. 96 Simon the sorcerer. Act. 8.A crime there is, neere kin vnto the other, Which from the Authour doth deriue its name: 'Tis Simonie, to Sacriledge next brother, A Sorcerer he was who broacht the same: Yet, by the wonders which Saint Philip wrought, Within the Churches verge he had been brought. 97 He thought Gods gifts with money might be gayn'd, Saint Peter checks him sharpely for his fault, Exhorts him to repent with zeale vnfayn'd: Perhaps the man did so as he was taught. Himselfe he humbled, seemed penitent, I find no mention of his punishment. 98 “That argues not, the fault t'haue beene the lesse, “God strikes, and spares whom to him seemeth good: “A late example makes vs so confesse, Luk. 13. 4.“Like Siloes Tower rightly vnderstood.) “Those faults are both of them so neere of kinne, “I wot not which to call the greater sinne. 99 The Church hath long beene pesterd with those crimes, (Th' are deeply mor'd, 'tis hard to weed them out) If holy Peter liu'd in these our times, 'Twould cause him rowze himselfe, and looke about, And strike some dead, to make the others feare. “Examples moue, wordes onely beat the aire. 100 As Peter, Ananias and his wife For their offences, with a word did slay: Reuiuing Tabitha. Act. 9. So, good Tabitha he restores to life, When kneeling by her carkasse, he did pray. Onely he bid her rise, then vp shee sat, Many beleeu'd, and wondred much thereat. 101 How much did he amaze the faithfull Iewes, Cornelius and the Gentiles conuerted. Act. 10, &amp; 11. In shewing them the Gentiles strange conuersion? At first they were offended with the newes, And rashly laid on him a foule aspersion: But when he plainely told them all the storie, They held their peace, and gaue to God the glorie. 102 Strange wonders more were by th' Apostles wrought, Other great wonders done by the Apostles. Act. 5. 12. As if their Lord himselfe had beene in place: The sick in couches, and in beds were brought, No kinde of griefe made difference in the case: All coming to them, whole and sound were made, Yea some, obtayning onely Peters shade. Saint Peters shadow. 103 Not much vnlike it's noted of Saint Paul, Saint Pauls Napkins. Act. 19. 12. The linnen clothes that from his person came, Draue-out foule spirits, and cur'd diseases all: Done by Christs helpe and onely in his Name. He that to mortall men such pow'r could giue, Him to be more then man, we must belieue. 104 Act. 5. 19.Strong prison doores flue-ope, to let them out, So did an Iron gate, though surely warded: Act. 12. 7. 10. &amp; 16. 26.They shakt off chaines, and fetters like a clout, And past through all such watches as them guarded: Till their Commission they had fully ended, Their Master from all Tyrants, them defended. 105 Saint Pauls wonderfull conuersion. Act. 9.When Saul against the faithfull tyranniz'd, With bonds and torments threatning them to punish In wondrous manner sodenly surpriz'd, A light from heauen did him so astonish, That tumbling downe he fell, and lost his sight, The vision which appeared was so bright. 106 To him our Lord himselfe distinctly spake, Recall'd him from the error he was in: Vers. 20.He readily obey'd, and nothing slacke, To preach and teach did presently begin: And plainly prou'd, that Christ in deed was hee, By God ordayn'd, worlds Sauiour to bee. 107 Now shall you heare how persecuting Saul, Conuerted by so strange an apparition: Became a most religious preaching Paul, Act. 18. 9. and 22. 17. 1. Cor. 15. 10. Rom. 15. 19.Receau'd from Christ himselfe a new Commission: Wherein he labour'd more then all the rest, His labours with a faire successe were blest. 108 Act. 11. 6. The first name of Christians, was at Antioch.At Antioch, a Citie of renowne, The faith of Christ he so diuinely taught: As first the name of Christians in that Towne, Was giu'n to all, who to the Faith were brought. (O, as we doe retayne that glorious Name, So would we doe such workes, as fit the same!) 109 As to darke men they oft restored sight, Elimas the sorcerer stricken blinde by Paul. Act. 13. So with a word they would strike others blinde. A Sorcerer resisting Paul with might, The force of his commanding word did finde: That act made Sergius Paulus yeild assent To Christian faith, with great astonishment. 110 A most diuine and pythie exhortation, (Like Peters sermon at Ierusalem) Act. 2. Paul boldly spake to that vntoward Nation, Yet little good his preaching did to them: Act. 13. 16. The Gentiles gladly did the Truth embrace, And were accepted in the others place. 111 How comes it, that the Word diuinely taught, Makes some more stubborne then they were before? When other-some therewith are sweetly caught, With grace replenisht daily more and more? “What's antidote to one, another kills, “What saues the sonnes life, oft the fathers spills. 112 The fires warmth, and heat of shining Sunne, A Comparison. A roll of waxe doth gently mollifie: On dirt and clay the contrarie is done, These more obdurate grow, and hard thereby. Some men haue hearts of waxe, and some of clay, In Sunne or Fire the fault we must not lay. 113 This great Apostle neuer sate him downe, But still attending on his holy Function, He trauail'd day and night, from towne to towne: Some, moued in their hearts with true compunction, Were won to Christ: Some others stirr'd vp strife, And some laid plots, to take away his life. 114 A creeple heale by Saint Paul at Lystra. Act. 14.At Lystra lay a creeple impotent, Who neuer vs'd his legs since he was bore: Stand vp, quoth Paul; he leapt incontinent, Then they who long had knowne the man before, Would needes haue done vnto him sacrifice, And hardly were restrayned with his cries. 115 A Simile, or Comparison.Eu'n as a grand Commander in the field, Who ouer many thousands hath the charge: Walks oft about his campe, and resteth seild, Suruayes it round (although in compasse large) Where he perceaues his men stand most in need, There he runnes in, and succours them with speed: 116 So this grand Captayne of the Christian bands, Who fought against a strong and subtill foe: Act. 16. &amp; 17. &amp; 18.Reviewes his Souldiers in remotest lands, New-heartens those he had, still takes vp moe: His foe-mans Souldiers runne to him amayne, With such good pay, he did them entertayne. 117 He casteth out a spirit of diuination. Act. 16. 14.In Macedon where Lydia was conuerted, A Maide which had a sprite of diuination: To Paul and Silas who with him consorted, Great trouble bred, and cruell castigation. When he the Deuill by his word expell'd, Some much incenst with rage against him swell'd. 118 That sooth-saying Damsell brought her Master gayne, Who when he saw the hope thereof was gone: He cryes out to the Magistrates amayne, Implores their ayde, else they were qu te vndone. These Iewes (saith he) doe trouble all our Towne: So were they whipt, and to the Iayle cast downe. 119 How loath are worldly men to beare a crosse? Such as be rich, haue all things at the full, They'll follow Christ, so't be not to their losse: Act 18. 22. You prick their hearts, if once their fleece yee pull. Demetrius gayning by Dianaes shrines, Act. 19. With all the craftsmen 'gainst Saint Paul combines. 120 Silas and he were fast set in the stocks, Being in prison, by a wonderfull earthquake the Iayler is conuerted. Act. 16. They pray'd all night, and Psalmes to God did sing: The prison strangely shakt, off flue the locks, The Iayler all amazed at the thing, Admires the men: He with his familie Baptiz'd, were turn'd to Christianitie. 121 A Traytor who vnto a Crowne aspires, A Comparison. Deuiseth how to climbe vp to the Throne: The better to accomplish his desires, And gayne the Honour due to Kings alone: Prepares himselfe by apish imitation, Ere he presume to broach his innouation. 122 First frames a count'nance fit for Maiestie, Like Perkin in H. 7. Then counterfeits, iust like a King to talke: He learnes the way to speake Imperiously, Next tries how Prince-like he in state can walke: Thus when he thinkes himselfe shap't fit for action, He makes some vse of Partners in his faction. 123 His Warrants and Commissions flie about, As if he were a King in veritie: His Officers, among the simpler rout, Make shew of iustice, and sinceritie: But, as in their mayne-warrant there is fault, So all their deeds are counterfeit, and naught. 124 The Deuill a Traytor to God, doth what he can to counterfeit Gods miracles.The Deuill is to heauens King a traytor, Vsurps Gods lawfull iurisdiction: He drawes vnto him many a gracelesse wayter, Some he beguileth with his subtill fiction: By sleights he makes his Vassals to belieue, That he like powre, as God himselfe, can giue. 125 Exod. 7.When Moses by Commission from his God, First to King Pharo did himselfe present: He rayz'd a liuing Serpent of his Rod, To make it knowne, that he from God was sent. This deed (in reason) might haue mou'd the King, But that the Deuill closely crost the thing. 126 False Sorcerers (the Deuills Iourney-men, That long had beene Apprentice to the Trade) By their enchauntments did the like agen, I thinke, not so in substance, but in shade. For Moses Serpent truly being so, Deuoured theirs, which were but such in show. 127 Exod. 8. 18.The vilest vermine rays'd from Egypts dust, Compell'd th' Inchaunters to confesse Gods hand: Small reason had they in their Art to trust, Exod. 9 11.Sith they in Moses presence could not stand: But all as much with botches were opprest, As other men, the cattle and the beast. 128 Iewish Exorcists beaten by the Deuill. Act. 19. 13.Among the Iewes, while Paul true wonders wrought, The Deuill had Commissioners abroad: These, not Gods glorie, but their Masters sought, Abus'd the Name of Iesus to their fraud: As though bare naming Iesus, and Saint Paul, Without true faith, could worke those wonders all. 129 These Exorcists were quickly taught to know, Their fault in vsing counterfeit Commission: The Deuill made the men themselues beshrew, For as they vs'd their skill without suspition, The man whom they (being seuen) had coniur'd, Doth wound them all, and sends them to be cur'd. 130 Behold the common tricks of that Seducer, The Deuill doth seduce his Vassals, to hurt and destroy them. Good Angels shape in shew he doth assume: Of all that come to him, he is th' abuser, When most vpon his fauour they presume, He quits their seruice with a wofull hire, Prouides them lodging in a flame of fire. 131 Meanewhile (perhaps) till he of them be sure, With vaine and short delights giues them content: Then hauing trayn'd them readie to his lure, Prepares himselfe vnto their punishment. Hee'll take a limme or ioynt, in part of pay, T'assure him of the whole another day. 132 These Exorcists, sore wounded for their paines, With shame and sorrow, tooke them to their heeles: The man possest, no helpe by them regaines, Nor easement of his former torment feeles. “All deuillish Artists finde the like successe: “Small good they doe themselues, to others lesse. 133 But they to whom Christ did that powre impart, To worke great wonders, calling on his Name: To men opprest brought ease, and ioy of heart, To them and to their doctrine, prayse and fame. Beleeuers, in their faith were faster grounded, Oppugners of the Truth, thereby confounded. 134 Paul restoreth dead Eutichus to life. Act. 20.While Paul at Troas preacht till mid of night, Intending his departure on the morrow: A chance befell that did them much affright, Possest his hearers hearts with griefe and sorrow. A sleeping youth fell downe three stories hie, And with the fall, departed instantlie. 135 Some friends (it's like) were there, who for him grieu'd, Discomfort to the rest the chance did breede, Sith he was of the faithfull, and belieu'd: But Paul, who neuer fail'd his friends at need, When he had stretcht himselfe vpon the Lad, Reuiued him, and made th' assembly glad. 136 “For one good faithfull man, of God belou'd, “A multitude oft doe his fauour finde: Act. 27.By Pauls example that was fully prou'd, When in a ship tost with tempestuous winde, Two hundred seuentie fiue God to him gaue, And for his sake the liues of all did saue. 137 As he not long before to them had told, When sad despaire possessed all their hearts: He comforts them, perswades them to be bold, (So they would ply themselues to doe their parts, For why, fit meanes might not be cast aside:) No losse of one mans life should them betide. 138 It so fell out. A matter seldome seene, Where seas so swell'd, and tempests were so strong: No trauailer who in like case had beene, So tost with waues, and toyll'd with labours long, Would thinke in such a wreck, neere fourteene score, Not one man lost, should all come safe to shore. 139 When Paul had past the danger of the Seas, And safely landed in Melita's Ile. He rested not, nor idly tooke his ease, Intending his Commission all the while. Diseased people flockt to him amayne, He cured all, and rid them of their payne. 140 Among the rest, the Ruler of that place, A noble Romane, shew'd him curtesie: Whom Paul requited with a worke of grace, The Rulers father sicke, and like to die, In perfect health he setled by his prayer, And many moe, that did to him repayre. 141 That great Physitian of our soules and bodies, Who cured all diseases with a word. Could not escape the taunts of simple noddies, (Whereof in holy Writ I finde record) Luk. 4. 23. But some durst say, if thou haue pow'r at will, Physitian heale thy selfe, and shew thy skill. 142 I reade how Paul was once put to that push, Act. 28. 3. Vpon himselfe his pow'rfull art to proue: The triall would haue made a stout man blush, But he assured of his Masters loue, Those dangers which did other men appall; Esteemed light, and reck'ned them but small. 143 No sooner was he free on shore from drowning, His nummed lims refreshing by a fire: As if both sea and land lookt on him frowning, And creatures all against him did conspire: A worme whose biting present death would bring, Doth seize his hand, and closely to it cling. 144 This hap, the standers by did much affright, Who knew the Vipers venom was so strong: That none whom they should happen once to bite, Vers. 4.From swelling, or from death could hold out long. A murtherer they iudg'd him to haue beene, This plague laid on him, for that horrid sinne. 145 He soone shooke-off the beast into the flame, Not mou'd, nor feeling any harme at all: The people then began t'extoll his name, They change their mindes, and him a God they call. Poore fooles, they might haue said, and spoken right, That none could so haue done, but by Gods might. 146 Now put together since the worlds creation, All workes of wonder done in any time, Which might deserue or challenge admiration, In any Countrey, Region, or Clime: (Except what Moses and Gods Prophets wrought) Compar'd with these, they'll seeme as things of nought. 147 Here could I lose my selfe with wonderment, Amid this forest of such rarities: My soule is stricken with astonishment, And most at Iewish incredulities, To thinke how such a Sauiour they could scorne, Who of their bloud, and for their good was borne. 148 An Atheistical obiection.An Atheist, or a selfe-wise polititian, Presuming on the finenesse of his wit: Will rayse a doubt (much like a Matchiuellian) And sweare, there's no Diuine can answere it, Such Apes there be that hugge their own brain-broods, Deeme all men, but themselues, of muddie moods. 149 If these Apostles could such wonders worke, Make sicke men whole, restore the dead to life, Giue blinde men sight, strike some sharpe-sighted darke; Resolue me of one doubt, to end the strife. Why could they not haue mast'red all their foes, Who slaught'red them, and bred them many woes? 150 That (thinke these men) had beene the onely way, Their doctrine and themselues so to haue grac't, As all men would them readily obay, No Tyrant, such examples, had out fac't. But sith themselues they were not able saue, We doubt how they such helpe to others gaue. 151 So said the Iewes when they our Lord reuil'd, Matth. 27. 39. From them these Wizards this objection borrow: The Scribes and Priests spake scoffingly, and smil'd, (What time his suffrings might haue mou'd their sorrow:) Come downe now from the Crosse, so wee'll belieue, Else, to thy Doctrine we no credit giue. 152 Though he had Angell-legions at his becke, Matth. 26. 5; Whereby his foe-men all he could haue slaine: Though he could soone haue giu'n them such a checke, As all their banding 'gainst him, had beene vaine: Yet, to another purpose was he bore; T'accomplish things, long prophecy'de before: 153 How then should Scriptures be fulfill'd? (said hee) Answere to the obiection. That answere may suffice vs in this case: From Masters state, the seruants were not free, Most willingly the Crosse they did embrace. “So, all that purpose to be Christ his schollers, “In patient suff'ring they must be his followers. 154 Sundrie Similes.“Gold's not refin'd, but if it feele the fire; “Wheat not well cleans'd, but by the winde or fan: “Who can expect a worthy Souldiers hire, “Vnlesse he fight, and quit him like a man? “We are Gods men of warre, his gold, his wheat; “We must be cleans'd, refin'd, with labours sweat. 155 The workes by Christ, and his Apostles done, Might well suffice their Doctrine to auerre: To get beliefe in such as would be wonne, Confound all those, that wilfully would erre. Of greater workes then those there was no need, Men must be pleas'd, with what God hath decreed. 156 Luk. 16. 27.The Glutton sought a messenger from heauen, (When he in hell, for sinnes fore-past did burne:) Who might relate a message to his brethren, And moue them from their wicked deeds to turne. Gods written warnings which they had afore, Were left vnto them: they could get no more. 157 A Comparison.Is't meet a Vassal should prescribe his Liege, The way how he his people ought to rule? Or that a priuate Souldier at a siege, Command the breach to enter, or recule? If no, lesse reason hath a mortall wight, Direct his God the way to rule aright. 158 The wonderfull and miraculous encrease of Christen faith,One worke of wonder resteth to be told, Though some (perhaps) will not confesse so much: As Maxim, not as Paradox I hold, It iustly merits to be termed such: That Christen faith should grow so fast, and flourish, E're King, or State endeuour'd it to nourish. 159 The Gentiles furiously together rag'd, Psal. 2. and Act. 4. 25. Their Kings and Princes banding did vnite: 'Gainst th' Infant-Church they wholly were engag'd, To roote it out they bent their wit, and might. Both Iewes and Gentiles therein did agree, To stop the growth of Christianitie. 160 When Romane Empire flourisht in her prime, Maugre Heathen Rom. Emperors, in the highest of their power Had all the world subiected to her yoke: Whose lawes to breake, was held a haynous crime, A sacriledge their Idolls to prouoke. New legionarie Souldiers then arose, Th' old Emperors had neuer none like those. 161 Grey-headed Fathers marcht in foremost ranke, By meanes in seeming weake and feeble. Graue Matrones boldly did those Leaders second: Young striplings of their bloud and life were franke, And tender Virgins follow'd them as jocond. Weake troupes (a man would thinke) to win a field, Get ground vpon their foes, and make them yeild. 162 Such were those noble Christen Martyrs old, That first enlarg'd the bounds of Christs Dominions: No Heathen worthies euer were so bold, So constantly maintayned their Opinions. By their example Nations were conuerted, And Heath'nish-Idoll-Altars all subuerted. 163 Their Precepts tended not to vaine delights, Pious principles of Christianitie. Nor loos'd the reynes to lustfull libertie: Not smoothly soothed carnall-minded wights, Nor sau'ring ought of sensualitie. But teaching men, worlds pleasures to despise, Set onely heauens ioyes before their eyes. 164 Humilitie and Meeknesse to professe, To offer no man wrong, but suffer rather: To succour widdowes, and the fatherlesse, No goods, but onely by good meanes, to gather: To feede the hungrie with their bread and meate, With clothes the naked keepe from cold, and heate. 165 Chastely to liue, and shunne Incontinence, Th' vnruly flesh with often fasts to tame: To liue vprightly, giue no man offence, Of vice and lewdnesse onely to take shame. To doe in all things vnto other men, As we wish others doe to vs agen. 166 Say, was not this a worke of wonderment? Rom. 1. 21.That men who knew not God, but seru'd the Deuill; The way which Nature led them, therein went; Whose thoughts were fleshly, all their actions euill: Their liues in sports, and pleasures vaine did spend, Suppos'd they were created to that end? 167 That such men freely should the world forsake, Bid vaine delights, and vanities adue: Themselues to rigid rules of life betake, Renounce old errors: like Babes borne of new, Suck the sweet milke of pious Christen Doctrine, Gladly endure the yoke of Church discipline? 168 Compare these times with theirs, it will appeare, Such alteration was a matter strange: Sith men 'mongst whom Christs doctrin now shines cleare, From vertue vnto vice profanely range: Now most professing Christ, like Heathens liue, And by their deeds, denie what they belieue. 169 A wonder 'tis, in either of the twaine, Or vs, or them: (aduize vpon the oddes) It's fear'd least Paganisme returne againe, And Heath'nish manners, bring in Heathen gods, Among the Iewes, iust so it came to passe, Our state is seene in theirs as in a glasse. 170 Not so, as did the Christian faith first rise, Mahometisme how it first beganne. That worlds-great-damn'd Seducer did begin: By other meanes his foule impieties Were set abroach, and did their credit win. Antithesis betwixt it, and Christianisme. The Romaine Empire growing to decay, To that false prophets doctrine made a way. 171 'Mongst men of nature fierce, of weake beliefe, Of manners lewd, of dissolute conditions, That false Seducer he became the chiefe, So pleasingly set forth his propositions; With cunning art, and subtle stratagemes, He first divulg'd his gracelesse theoremes. 172 Halfe-Iew, halfe-Christian he makes shew to bee, Takes some thing from them both, as likes him best: What tends to pleasure, wealth, and libertie, That he culls-out, and ouer-slips the rest: So made a medley of religions both, Which then had in the world the chiefest growth. 173 Not much vnlike a palat-pleasing Cooke, A Simile though simple yet not vnseemely, for the thing assimilated. That dights some luscious dish to feed a Glutton: On sundrie sorts of Cates at hand doth looke, Takes one choice morsell from a well-fed mutton One bit he borrowes of a fatted Capon, Layes in a little piece of sweet new Bacon. 174 From fat-beeues bones drawes halfe a pound of marrow, Of Kid hee'll haue a part, and so of Veale: For birds-flesh minceth out the Larke, and Sparrow, Addes Spices, Sugar, Sack a pretie deale. Thus makes a Hotch-potch fit to feede a Gull, Who chops it vp, till he be gorged full. 175 So, that religion-monger Mohomet, To feede the fancies of vnstable braines: From all religions doth such Maxims get, As best might sooth mens humours, fit their vaines. No meruaile if a doctrine so all-pleasing, Tooke roote, assisted by his fraud and leasing. 176 “Force ioyn'd with fraud and cunning, may doe much, “It's hard those sleights, and engins to withstand: That Sect began, and is vp-held by such, Not with the touch, whereby the Truth is scan'd. The meanes that rays'd our faith, first made it flourish, Are best the same to foster, feede and nourish. 177 Gods hand's not short'ned, but that still he can, And doth somewhile worke wonders in this Age: Yet they are needlesse to a Christen man, Whose faith is founded on a former gage. Whom Christs old wonders cannot satisfie, An Infidell he liues, and so hee'll die. 178 The Authour endeth this Classis with a deuout prayer.Oh might I liue some miracles to see, (Then die the death that righteous men desire:) Our pride, conuerted to humilitie: Our cold deuotion to loue-kindling fire: Our auarice, to liberalitie: Our luxurie, to stayd sobrietie: 179 Our cancred hatred, turn'd to charitie: Our captious questions in Theologie, (Foule enemies of fairest Vnitie!) To simple Truths sincere Apologie. Our swords diuerted from our fellowes hearts, Against that foe, which worketh all our smarts. 180 This worke thou, onely thou canst bring to passe, Whose admirable acts my Muse doth tell: Thy pow'r is now as great as e're it was, But we of thee doe not deserue as well. The lesser our desert, the more's thy grace: Wayuing the first, the later we embrace. 181 Great Lord of Hosts, and gracious God of Peace, (These Titles both, to thee of due belong.) Thou makest warres, and causest them to cease, Defendest right, hast no delight in wrong. Though horse and charet be prepar'd to fight, Yet victorie consists not in their might. 182 Shew forth thy pow'r, as thou hast done of yore, Bow downe the backs of Nimrodizing men: Now make them feele thy hand, as heretofore, Let hundreds of them, turne their backs to ten. Let windes, and seas, and skies at thy drad beck, Fight for thy chosen, giue their foes a check. 183 Let King and Prince be vnder thy protection, As they thy Truth, and people doe protect: Let Subiects yeild to them all due subiection, So, let their fauours back on them reflect. Let Vnitie vs in one bundle binde, That all may be of one heart, and one minde. 184 A worke of wonder: yet, so well begunne, As cheeres vp good mens hearts to see't perfected: Let them that with faire meanes could not be wonne, Repent for peacefull passages reiected. When Sion ioyes in this felicitie, Then with old Simeon I desire to die. The end of the third Classis. The fourth Classis. THE ARGVMENT. The Christen Doctrines true, on Scriptures, grounded, With Moses morall written Lawes agree: The Decalogue for proofe, plainely expounded; 'Twixt Christs and Moses Hests, true sympathie. We for our triall, sticke to both the Tables: But Iewes and Turkes build vp their faith on fables. 1 The surest way to know a perfect gem, A Simile, or Comparison, shewing the excellency of Christian Doctrine, aboue all other. “To trie true mettle from the counterfet, “Is held to be by close comparing them: “For Truth and Falsehood both together set, “That, beareth in it such a perfect grace, “As doth the others bastard-worth-deface. 2 Though man by nature be enclin'd to ill, Depriu'd of pow'r to doe, or thinke aright: Rather to Vice, then Vertue hath a will, Pursues the way of errour with his might: Vntill he be enlightned from aboue, And thereby vnto goodnesse take a loue. 3 Yet is he not so brutishly all-blinded, Rom. 1. 20. &amp; 2. 14. His reason and his iudgement made so weake: (Though all-deprau'd, and wholly fleshly-minded.) But that he heares the Creatures lowdly speake, Informe his conscience to see the oddes, 'Twixt good and ill, the Deuills wayes and Gods. 4 Else, were't not so, Men might be held excuseable, Had they no meanes to know the ill from good: The way of vice should not be held so damnable, If vertue from't, might not be vnderstood: But, when man knowes what's good, yet chooseth th' euill, He runnes from God, and posteth to the Deuill. 5 The Authour prayeth for true vnderstanding in Christen precepts of pietie: And for grace to liue accordingly.Thou God of Truth, with whom no errour dwells, Who wouldest not that men should goe astray: Who warnest him that 'gainst the Truth rebells, Who leadest wandring folke into the way: Whose precepts are so holy, iust, and right, That men (not hood-winkt) may walke in their light. 6 Send downe thy Spirit of Truth into our heart, Teach vs to know the way that leades to thee: Poore simple erring soules vouchsafe conuert, Ope thou their eyes that they may cleerly see, The path, which all thy seruants ought to trace, Whereby to come into thy resting place. 7 To me, thy most vnworthy Suppliant, (Who venter of this loftie Theame to sing, With humble heart.) Diuine assistance grant: That as my pen thy prayses forth shall ring, My selfe may doe, as others I direct; Not scribble of thy Lawes, and them neglect. 8 Looke here for no deepe disputable doctrines.To treat of Doctrines full of deepe dispute, I neuer had the purpose, nor the will: Great Doctors, erring Doctors must confute, That subiect sutes not with my oaten quill. I'll pipe of Precepts teaching pietie, Confine my Muse to Countrey Diuinitie. 9 Such rules as Christ vnto his hearers gaue, Of duties first to God, and next to Men: The choise of these in meeter shall yee haue, All grounded on those heauenly Precepts ten. For, what to life and manners doth pertaine, Is all compris'd within the Tables twaine. 10 This Law, our Lord came wholly to fulfill, Math. 5. 17. Not to destroy: (as some conceau'd amisse.) His errand was, to doe his Fathers will, His Doctrine and his Precepts aym'd at this. And all that will his true Disciples bee, With him in Life, and Doctrine must agree. 11 Let Satan vse the vtmost of his skill, 1. and 2. Precepts: God only to be adored; and serued with diuine and religious worship. Matth. 4. 8. Lay baites of worldly Empire, wealth and glorie, To force, or leade vs to his cursed will: Doe we, as Christ did in the holy Storie, Defie the fiend, and tell him to his head, That God alone is to be worshipped. 12 When on the holy Mount he did descend, Exod. 19. 18. With fearefull lightnings, smoake, and dreadfull thunder. To giue the Law which his owne finger penn'd, When Sinai shooke, as it would rend asunder: Similitude or likenesse they sawe none, Deut. 4. 11. A voyce from-out the fire, was heard alone. 13 To teach them how their God, who is a Spright, Iob 4. 24. Requires the inward seruice of the heart: And that the way to worship him aright, Is not left free to mans owne will, or art: But plainely chalkt-out in the holy Writ, Each person strictly bound to walke in it. 14 Deut. 4. 24. Similes, shewing that God will haue no Partners in his worship; neither Angels, nor Saints.Hee's like a husband, jealous of his phere; A King, admits no Partners in his Crowne: His Saints and Seruants whom he holds most deere, Want not their due, of honour and renowne. The state of heauen is meere Monarchicall, Where one holds souereigne honour ouer all. 15 Yet is he not without societie, Eu'n such as sorteth with equalitie: Three persons are there in the Deitie, All Three, make but one perfect Vnitie. Here Trinitie in Vnitie doth meet, We must beleeue't, although we cannot see't. 16 Similes, too simple to illustrate the thing that may not be assimiled.Doth not a Fount, a running streame beget, From both of which proceedes a standing Poole? 'Tis all one water: like in nature, wet, Like sweet, like fresh, like vertue hath to coole. A poore compare: yet, to our shallow wit, Points to the thing, and giues a glance at it. 17 The Sunne, from-out it selfe engendreth light, All-fostring heat and warmth, proceedeth thence: It's one selfe thing the Sunne, the heat, the light. Th' example fitteth our intelligence: That Mysterie the great'st of Mysteries, May not be seene, but onely with faiths eyes. 18 Rom. 1. 22.Old worldly wizards prou'd themselues meere fooles, By forming God to their imaginations: Of whom they taught such lessons in their schooles, As sorted with grosse carnall cogitations. So farre were they become infatuated, T'adore things made, for him who them created. 19 Who taught the Gentiles, Idols to detest? One God, th' All-Maker, onely to adore? (A truth wherewith Iewes solely were possest, And none but they, instruct therein before.) 'Twas he, whose comming strake the Deuills dumbe: At Christs birth, all Oracles ceased. Turn'd all their sooth-sayes to a wordlesse mum. 20 Giue him the glorie of this gracious worke, He led the World from darknesse, into light: Not that false prophet honour'd by the Turke, Who claymes th' aduantage of anothers right. His pusnie temps, must yeild t'our primer seisin: Mahometisme began 600. yeeres after Christ. 3. Precept. Of oathes, and swearing. Deut. 6. 13. Ier. 5. 7. His late reuolt, conuinceth him of treason. 21 A branch of worship due to God alone, In holy Scriptures often is recorded, To sweare by his great Name, and else by none: To creatures no such honour is affoorded. He knowes who rightly sweares, and who amisse: False-swearers plagues, Truth-tellers crowns with blisse. 22 When Magistrates for triall of mens right, The lawfull vse of oathes taken by a Magistrate. For putting lawfull end to doubtfull pleas, For branding falshood, bringing Truth to light, For short'ning long demurrs, and fond delayes, Call men to speake their knowledge on their oath. They ought to doe it, be they ne're so loth. 23 Who this wise swearing, iustifies a truth, This man takes not in vaine Gods holy Name: Sith thereby glorie to heauens King ensu'th, The iust man credit gets, the lyer shame. By this sole meane, all strife 'mongst men is ended, Heb. 6. 6. As proofe falls out, not as the man is friended. 24 Anabaptists allow no oath, in that they disallow all Magistrates, who alone haue power to minister an oath. Matth. 5. 34.Some, seeming pious more then other men, Pretending care, Gods Name be not profan'd, Allow no oath by any meanes: not then When King, or Iudges vnder him command. The Truth (say they) forbids vs sweare at all: Let Yea, and Nay suffice: with vs it shall. 25 'Tis spoken well, if well it be apply'de. Uers. 37.In common talke, and free communication, An oath in no wise can be iustify'de: But such Disputers vse preuarication. Pretending the defence of pietie, They proue bold patrones of impietie. 26 They'll not endure a ciuill Magistrate, Who mought exact an oath on good occasion: Haile fellowes all (with them) no King, but Mate; Equalitie's their ayme. So here's th' euasion, Excluding all degrees of Dignitie, They leaue no meanes, an oath to iustifie. 27 Whence learn'd these Doctors this diuinitie? Not from the sacred Volumes old, nor new: Not from chiefe Teachers of humanitie, Not from the Christian Doctors, nor the Iew: Examples, Reason, Scriptures them confute. What need we more then those, to strike them mute? 28 “Each vertue bounded sits 'twixt two extreames, “Truth's doggu'd by Error close on either side: “As some teach doctrines, so some vent their dreames, “One falshood from the other starteth wide. The case now in dispute doth make it cleere, Obserue the lesson next ensuing heere. 29 One Scribbler, Authour of a spreading Sect, Machiauel allowes periurie, and false-swearing: for polecie. In Com. &amp; lib. de prin. passim. Stands not so much on point of conscience. He bids his Schollers sweare without respect, As frankly with their oathes he doth dispence. Keepe faith, and oathes? (quoth he.) Why that's for fooles: No such disciples enter in my Schooles. 30 Prouided alwayes, that your periurie Breed your aduantage, worke your foes annoy: It makes no matter, so you gaine thereby, Religion in this case is but a toy. These be the precepts of that shamelesse clarke. Did euer three-tongu'd-hell-hound-curre so barke! 31 A damned doctrine, hatched first in hell, The hatefull haggish Furies brought it thence: The foster-father was curs't Machiauel, He plac't it chiefe in grace about his Prince. A true resemblance of Don Plutoes court, Where such accursed courtiers doe resort. 32 Yet some there be, that out of holy zeale, Some allow breach of oath vpon pretence of aduancing Gods cause, and for pietie, Pretending true Religion to promote, To benefit the Christian Common-weale, To set the ship of Christ beneapt, a-flote: To cut-off scabbed sheepe, not to be cur'd: To root-out errors, not to be endur'd: 33 Thinke no offence their oath to falsifie, As Vladislaus King of Hungarie did with Amurath, before the vnfortunate battell of Varna. But rather hold it for a pious worke: As those, who (to all Christians infamie) Periuriously made warre vpon the Turke: Where it appeared by the foule successe, How well our Lord such periuries doth blesse. 34 2. Sam. 21. Saul. Saul burnt in zeale for Israel, Gods chosen, Crackt oath, to worke the Gibeonites confusion: Better that firie frenzie had beene frozen, His Progenie so found it in conclusion. Some Sauls now, making shew of pure deuotion, With fire and sword, set Europe in commotion. 35 Let great-ones sweare, and vn-sweare at their will, Make zeale a cloake, ambitious thoughts to hide: Small hope haue they to rest vpon Gods hill, Psal. 15. 3. 5.For there plaine-dealing men are sure t'abide: Such men as keepe their oathes religiously, Though they be most assur'd to lose thereby. 36 All rash and idle swearing I disproue, Sith common swearers seldome speake the troth: Yet once I'll venter sweare by him aboue, It's damn'd impietie to breake an oath. Such men make God a witnesse to their lie: Shall they escape for this impietie? 37 Zech. 5. 4. and Ecclus. 23. 9.The plague shall haunt them, and their habitations, Consume the timber with the very stones: Leaue them no issue 'mong the Generations, Fret-out their flesh, and eate their very bones. Leuit. 24. 16.For, such as dare blaspheme Gods holy Name, Shall loathed liue, and lastly die with shame. 38 A Comparison.Suppose a Schoole-boy should be taken tripping, Among his fellowes facing-out vntruth: Say, were he not well worthy of a whipping, If standing to it like a gracelesse youth, He vouch his Master to auerre the lie, Yet knowing that his tongue runnes all awrie? 39 How then can they escape the hand of God, Who make him partner in their falsities? They must be scourged with an Iron rod, And feele the smart of their impieties. “True lawfull oathes, vnto his prayse redound; “All idle and false-swearers, hee'll confound. 40 “An oath by torture wrested, or by terror, “Where humane frailtie leades men to transgresse, “Leaues place for pardon: (though a grieuous error.) “By circumstances crimes grow more, or lesse. “For, wilfull sinnes presumptuously committed, “Offend God most, and hardly are remitted. 41 When God had brought his six-dayes-worke to end, 4. Precept. The Sabbath to bee sanctified. And saw that all was purely perfect good: A day of Rest he to himselfe did lend, (The sense must warely be vnderstood) For, though his labour put him to no paine, Yet when his worke is done, he rests againe. 42 That day wherein hee's said t'haue tane his rest, Gen. 2. 2. 3. To please himselfe in's workes rare perfection: He hallow'd it, and caus'd it to be blest, Respecting chiefly therein, our direction: That we might haue one speciall day 'mong seuen, Sabbath dayes workes for Christians. To leaue worlds toyles, and meditate on heauen. 43 To lift our mindes from rest that's corporall, From signe, to substance: shadowes, vnto things: Our soules to rayse-vp to the Rest eternall, By mounting thither on faiths nimble wings. That day to chew the cud, as cleane beasts did, All others, Moses in the Law forbid. 44 Exod. 20. and 23. 12.That Seruants, sweating for their Masters gayne, Might be allow'd their wearied limmes to ease: The Oxe and Asse from trauaile might refrayne, (For God approues not crueltie to these.) That all, aswell of high degree as lowe, Might learne their Maker, and his Lawes to know. 45 Works for the six dayes.Six dayes we haue in which we ought apply, Such workes as to our calling doe pertaine: The Prince with iustice, truth and equitie To rule his people. They must striue againe Obediently to serue, his Lawes obay, Fight for him at his need, and for him pray. 46 Man was not made to liue idly.God made not Man that he should idle liue, Not him, who Edens garden did possesse: When first his Lord did seisin to him giue, Gen. 2. 15.'Twas to the end, he should it keepe and dresse. He mought haue done't, with pleasure and delight, Had he perform'd his Makers will aright. 47 Now we vnto a harder taske are bound, The fruits of Eden serue vs not for meate: Gen. 3. 17. 13.For Adams sinne accursed was the ground, It yeilds vs poore reliefe, vnlesse we sweate. We sowe and reape, we set, we graffe, we plant, All scarse sufficeth to supply our want. 48 Yet the great King of Heau'n, and Lord of Earth, Hath stuft the Land and Sea with viands store: Inough to keepe off penurie and dearth, To please the rich, and to content the poore, Did not Excesse and Riot spend too fast; Idlers, the fruit of poore mens labours wast. 49 The Oxe and Asse once hauing fed their fill, Sundrie Similes and Comparisons, dehorting from riot and idlenesse. Forbeare more food, till they begin to hunger: All Neat and Sheepe in valley, or on hill, When nature's well suffic'd, they'll eate no longer: The earth that's drie, receauing wet due store, Shuts vp her clefts, and taketh in no more. 50 Then is't not strange, that man whose soule's diuine, Who all the Creatures doth command and rule: From Natures lawes should lawlessely decline, Be more disordered, then the Horse, or Mule? To gorge himselfe till he be readie burst? Not ceasse to drinke, when well hath quencht his thirst? 51 How comes it, that the pretie painfull Ant, Pro. 6. 6. and 30. 25. The Ant. By wise fore-cast prouides her store in season: Makes Summers plentie serue the Winters want? When some men, shewing slender vse of reason, In Haruest fold their hands, sit still and sleepe. Till winters cold, and hunger make them weepe. 52 The little busie Bee doth teach men skill, The Bee. They liue as in a firme-well-ordred state: A King they haue, and they obey his will, Each one is readie still to helpe his Mate. They'll ioyne together all, to kill the Drone, No honie shall he eate, sith he makes none. 53 Oft haue I found a nimble Squirrels neast, The Squirrell. So fully furnisht with ripe hasell nuts: As made me maruaile at the pretie beast, How he prouides to fill his emptie guts, By sparing when with riot he might feed, And laying vp, against the time of need. 54 Such diligence much more befitteth men, Who are not borne vnto themselues alone: What frugally they spare, the same agen They must disperse 'mongst others, that haue none. 2. Cor. 8.Our plentie should our neighbours wants supply, Such is the rule of Christian charitie. 55 Sundrie sorts of degrees and conditions of men in a Commonwealth, all of them vsefull.“That man which laboureth not in some vocation, “Straynes not the pow'rs of bodie, nor of minde, “Growes dull'd with ease, and lazie recreation, “Eates till be sweat, and drinkes himselfe halfe blinde: “Well may he haue of man the outward shape, “Yet is he like condition'd to an Ape. 56 The painfull plow-man, stores the Land with bread, Another spends his dayes 'bout Calues and Kine: A Grasier keepes his Bullocks to be fed, One gets his liuing by the pleasant Vine: The flocks of gentle Sheepe is this mans charge, That makes his dwelling in his Boat, or Barge. 57 Some shew their skill in rearing fruitfull Trees, By Orcharding and Gardning they get money: Some busily intend their stocks of Bees, Pick pence out of the wax, and from the honey. The Merchant brings rich wares from Countries farre, The Souldier serues his Prince, and State i'th' warre. 58 Of Mechanicks there's such varietie, 'Twould fill a pamphlet to recite them all: Each of these by their art and industrie, Helpe hold-vp States, which otherwise would fall. Pro. 14. 28.Th' encrease of people, strength and honour bring, (As saith the Wise-man) to an earthly King. 59 The Smith, the Mason, and the Carpenter, Eccles. 38. 32, 33, 34. The Potter with such like of meane condition, Albe't ne're called to the Councell-chamber: Yet take this for a grounded Proposition, Without their helpe a Citie neuer stands, But as mans bodie wanting both the hands. 60 Great Counsellors, graue Iudges, Aduocates, Next place to them allow vnto Ciuillians: Then Galenists: all these are props of States. (Some men ascribe no lesse to Paracelsians.) Aboue them all, the reuerend good Diuine, In most mens iudgements sits: and so in mine. 61 Though 'mongst these members some the rest excell, Yet sith they haue one head, one bodie make: The high'st may not against the lowest swell. For if the foot, or little finger ake, 1. Cor. 12. The head and heart, are partners in the paine: So, one rejoysing, all rejoyse againe. 62 Before th' aspiring nephew of curst Cham, 5. Precept. Honour parents. Encroacht vpon the freedome of his brothers: Boyes onely fear'd their Father, and their Dam, Acknowledg'd no subiection vnto others. So, rule and pow'r paternall had the prime Of Magistracies all, in th' elder time. 63 Mans duties to his God are first set downe, By him who was the maker of the Lawe: The Matter, and the Method were his owne. Of Parents next he wills vs stand in awe. That Law he grafted in the hearts of men, Ere any Precepts written were with pen. 64 No Childe, if he haue any sparke of grace, Or (lesse then that) touch of humanitie: But when he lookes his parents in the face, Beholds therein a kinde of sou'raigntie, Which strikes in him a reuerence and a feare, And makes him to their lessons, lend his eare. 65 Ephes. 6.A promise to this Precept God annext, Long life and dayes repleat with happinesse: You plainly finde it in the holy Text, Our heauenly Father so was pleas'd to blesse Exod. 21. 15. Deut. 27. 16. Matth. 15.Obedient sonnes: to lay a curse on others, That disobey their Fathers, or their Mothers. 66 Yet, parents somewhat to their children owe: Psal. 78. 4, 5, &amp;c.They are oblig'd, of them to haue a care: To teach them how they ought their Maker knowe, To giue them nurture, traine them vp in feare, Heb. 12. 7. Colos. 3. 21.Correct with reason: not with too much rigour, So leaue them heartlesse, sprightlesse, without vigour. 67 1. Sam. 2.Nor like old Ely, on their persons dote, Winke at their faults, vphold them in their errour: What he and his by such fond cock'ring got, I read it oft, but neuer without terrour. Uers. 29.Who so his children honours, more then God; Both he and they shall feele his heauie rod. 68 Magistrates comprehended vnder the name of parents. Leuit. 19. 15.By Parents likewise Magistrates are meant, The Fathers of the Kingdome, and the State: King, Iudges, Rulers who by him are sent, Mens causes, rights, and titles to debate. Iustly to deale with rich, and poore alike, Sheild innocents from wrong, offenders strike. 69 To these, our Lord himselfe a tribute payd, Matth. 17. 27. By his example shewes what should be done: Th' Apostles from his Doctrine neuer stray'd, Rom. 13. and 1. Pet. 2. 13. But taught vs follow him, as he begun. Render to God, what doth to God belong; Matth. 22. 20. Let Cesar haue his due, doe him no wrong. 70 Eye-pleasing seruice, that is not the thing, Ephes. 6. 5. (If well we note the Sense, and not the Letter.) Which seruants, Masters owe: subiects, their King: The holy Writings, they instruct vs better. It must be heartie: thoughts, wordes, deeds agreeing, Eccles. 8. and 10. 20. As done in sight of him who is all-seeing. 71 With this prouiso, that our heauenly Father Be first obey'd, when diff'rence doth arise: What he commands, we must performe that rather Then it, which earthly parents warantize. Hee's Father, of our fathers: King, of our Kings: All reuerence due to these, from him first springs. 72 What giddinesse possesseth some mens braines, Against Anabaptists, Familists, and all that rabble. Who frame themselues a bodie, lacking head? To lewd licentiousnesse they loose the reynes, As in authentike storie oft I read: When Is'rel had no King to rule the rest, Iudg. 21. 25. Then each man did, what to him seemed best. 73 Can ships without a Pilot at the helme, Sundrie Similes and Comparisons, shewing the absolute necessitie of Magistracie among men. Attayne the Harbour whither they are bound? But that the waues soone would them ouer-whelme, Or furious tempests split them on the ground? Can Coach or Charret passe without a guide, If Coach-man keepe not Steeds from running wide? 74 Did euer Armie march into the field, Without a chiefe Commander of the Host: Doth not each familie obeysance yeild, To one, aboue them all respected most? As is the Sunne, amid the firmament: So is the King, in ciuill gouernment. 75 Three old receaued formes of gouernment.Among the triple formes of policie, By Sages first for Regiment deuis'd: The chiefe and worthiest is A Monarchie, Democracie long since hath beene despis'd: That State wherein the best beare rule, and few: Is not so sound in proofe, as faire in shew. 76 On old examples I'll not much insist, But rather looke on things more neere at hand: A Monarchie the best, and most absolute of them all.The States that haue beene, most of them are mist, And in their fall, the Monarchie doth stand. As Nature aymes at all her workes perfection, So man, in things left free to his election. 77 The prototype of Sway and Soueraigntie, Directs vs wholly to the rule of one: One God, one King, it holds Analogie; This, vnder him: Hee, of himselfe alone. The Heauens, with our inferiour massie ball, Make but one Kingdome, to the Lord of all. 78 The lesser Kings, that rule by his Commission, Haue lesser worlds assign'd to them in charge: As that Great Monarch pleaseth make diuision, Which sometimes at his will he doth enlarge; Then subdiuides, of one such world, makes twaine; Ere long, ioynes two or three in one againe. 79 “For, vnder Sunne there's nothing permanent, Eccles. 1. “Great bodies suffer change aswell as small: “This, best is seene in formes of gouernment, “The one is raysed by the others fall. “Where many ioyntly sway soueraignitie, “Restlesse ambition sweates for primacie. 80 So is it where the Crowne lyes on election, Succession far better then election. Where each mans worth, giues hope to his desires: Where great-men haue the choise to trie their faction, And he that's best befriended, most aspires: Distracted Commons houer in suspence, Their hearts not settled on the doubtfull Prince. 81 Well 'twas obserued by a great wise King, Pro. 19. 10. &amp; 30. 22. and Eccles. 10. 7. When seruants sit on seates, and Princes stand: That's a most loathsom and vnpleasant thing, Procureth much disquiet in the Land, How can a sonne, whose father wore a crowne, See's seruant in the Throne, and he kept downe? 82 “A free-borne Prince beares Maiestie in's face, “Gaynes greater lustre by a long discent: “Faire branches springing from a Royall race, “Breede loyall Subiects comfort, and content. We need no samples from a forrein Land, None better then the neerest to our hand. 83 Where can we finde (bee't spoken in Gods feare, Without offence, much lesse to fawne, or flatter.) Of Royall Sire and Sonne so rare a paire, So fit to cleere, and iustifie this matter? Records of Time, true Chronicles, proue part, The rest reade in each faithfull subiects heart. 84 A short prayer of the Author, for the King.Blest little world, Great Britaines famous Ile, From all the world besides, strongly diuided: May heau'ns great King vouchsafe on thee to smile, So guide those heads by whom thy selfe art guided: That truly seruing him who rules aboue, They may be seru'd of vs with feare, and loue. 85 Psal. 118. 6, 7. and Rom. 8. 31.Then need we doubt no foe-men to affright vs, Our foes may rather stand of vs in feare: Whil'st Pietie and Concord doe vnite vs, Our God will be our buckler, shield and speare. If he be on our side, doe we our best, He of his goodnesse will supply the rest. 86 Church men also haue right of priuiledge in this precept.To Prelates, Pastors, Preachers of Gods Word, As to our Parents, filiall feare we owe: These, combat for our soules with sp'rituall Sword, In honouring them, we must not be too slowe. If well they rule the Church, and teach withall; A double honour to their lot doth fall. 87 Not in such sense, as some men doe imply Luk. 22.38. Heb. 4 12.By those Two Swords, whereof the Text doth tell: One sharpe two-edged sword best fits the Clergie, And serues their turne, if they can vse it well. 2. Cor. 10. 4.It cuts downe all that lifts it selfe on hie, Brings hearts and thoughts into captiuitie. 88 Ephes. 6. 13.So long as with this Sword our Church-men fight, Fit Armour of defence thereto apply'de: They need not feare the force of mortall wight, The Hoast of heauen standeth on their side: The Saints on earth likewise are readie prest, To follow them, as Leaders of the rest. 89 Such as to other weapons them betake, Matth. 26. 52. Which their Grand-Captayne charg'd them to forbeare: Christs Souldiers, those Instructers may forsake, Against such doctrine closely stop their eare. Th' Apostles who knew best their Masters will, 1. Tim. 3. Tit. 17. Iam. 3. 17. and 1. Pet. 3. 8. 6. Precept. Murther forbidden. Forbad to striue, contend, or fight and kill. 90 All Precepts of this Table which ensue, Are negatiues: forbidding sinfull deedes. Foule Murther's first: among the damned crue, Well knowne: the filthiest of peace-choaking weedes. In Beati pacifici, at large, Stan. 272. My Muse sang lately on this Theame so much, That in this place shee'll onely giue't a touch. 91 Degrees and Stayres be many in this sinne, All that step on them, tread the path to hell: Yet some are deepe, and plunge men sooner in, Some slayers are lesse deuillish, some more fell. What erst I writ, that to repeat were vaine, Twice sodden Cole-worts, breede the stomack paine. Crambebis secta, nocet. 92 The subiect's large, and yeilds new matter store, Wherein my slender talent will I spend, And treat of what I handled not afore: When as I misse, I shall be glad to mend. For though the Inke be black, wherewith I write: The Pen, the Paper, and the Heart are white. 93 The Roote from whence this lothsome weede doth sprout, An allegoricall description of murther. Curst Malice hight, in Witches gardens growes: The drops that water it, Enuie spues-out, The fostring warmth, from fuming choller flowes. When by these meanes it's ripe, then comes the Fiend, His venom, to perfect it, he doth spend. 94 Th' all-seeing Iudge, who kenns each inward thought, He lookes not onely on the outward act: Intent and Purpose shall not passe for nought, With him they are adiudged as the fact. 1. Iob. 3. 15.“In heart he kills a man, that doth him hate; “Though not so censur'd by the Magistrate. 95 “Yet plots, and proiects 'gainst a sou'raigne Prince, “Amount as high, as doe the acts of Treason: “The Person wrong'd, doth aggrauate th' offence, “That Law is grounded on the Base of Reason. “Sith Kings and Princes haue the style of Gods, “'Twixt thoughts &amp; deeds 'gainst them, there is no ods. 96 Admit (in any common persons case) A Caytife giue his Mate a poys'ned draught, In hope to leaue him dead vpon the place: Albe't the wretch be frustrate of his thought, And strength of nature driue the venom out: To call him Murtherer, who would make a doubt? 97 A tedious thing is forc't prolixitie, I like't worse in my selfe, then in another: Yet on this point pow'rfull necessitie, Constraines my Muse a little whiles to houer. To begge a pardon, ere a man beginne, All's one as craue a license for to sinne. 98 A Simile.I'll rather venter, like a trewant Lad, That takes a time to play, ere it be granted: A pardon comming after, makes him glad, Reuiues his spirits formerly halfe danted. Dispence with faults, when once you reade it o're; If't like you not, then neede you reade no more. 99 This Law forbidding one thing, bids another: The Rule of contraries doth so require: Kill not: inferres, hurt not: nor hate thy brother: Matth. 5. 43. But loue him as thy selfe, thy sonne, thy sire. How euer Iewes, and Turkes that precept take, True Christians all, doe this construction make. 100 How comes it then, that in these euill dayes, Some men who make most shew of Christen faith: Though Meeknesse, Loue, and Charitie they prayse, Scarse one of them doth practise what he saith? Nay, Church-men stick not Princes to incense, To kill, and slay, and sweare 'tis no offence. 101 While thus we from our Masters pathes decline, Teach doctrines to his Gospell cleane contrarie: Yet would we be accounted men diuine, Make some beleeue, from truth we doe not varie. Pretending holy zeale, and pietie, Against the rules of Christian charitie. 102 When Galley-slaues sit tugging at an Oare, A Simile. To force their Boat from Land into the Mayne: Their faces still are bent vpon the Shoare, Their backs to Sea-ward. Iust such is the vaine Of some, who gazing all at holinesse, Runne backwards to the gulfe of wickednesse. 103 The Iewes cry'de out, it lay not in their pow'rs Iob. 18. 31. To put our Lord to death: yet instantly, Within the space of some few after-how'rs, They found a Law of theirs to cause him die. Iob. 19. 7. “Who bend their minds on slaughter, wounds &amp; bloud, “Will finde a colour, how to make't seeme good. 104 'Tis shame to see a Christian whet his knife, To stab, or else to cut his fellowes throat: One Christian seekes another Christians life, The colour is, Religion to promote. That was no Christen Doctrine in old dayes, Our Christian Faith, encreast by other wayes. 105 2. King. 2.What though Elisha, holy Man of God, Spar'd not those gracelesse boyes that on him rally'd? 2. King. 1.What though his Master with a firie rod, Consum'd twice fiftie men who him assayll'd? These are examples, not for imitation, Rather to make vs feare Gods indignation. 106 Luk. 9. 54.Christ his Disciples milder Doctrine taught, When they vpon reuenge were wholly bent: Rebuking them, he said their thoughts were naught, And that Gods Spirit, no such motion sent. He came to saue mens liues, and not to spill: So his must win mens soules, not bodies kill. 107 1. Cor. 13.Oh, had I skill to speake with Angels tongue, To worke in stubborne hearts some true remorse: To make them listen to my gentle song, That wordes of peace might haue with them some force, That such as long haue vs'd their hands to slaughter, Might once wash cleane, and neuer foule them after. 108 Kings may lawfully make warre, vpon iust occasions. Gen. 14. Deut. 20. Luk. 14.Not that I hold with those who doe debarre, The Magistrate of his authentike right: As if he mought not lawfully make warre, Nor arme his subiects in his cause to fight. That Paradox, new Doctors lately broacht, And falsely on the Princes pow'r encroacht. 109 As they are priuiledg'd to giue an oath, So are they to draw out, and vse the sword: To sweare and fight, good subiects ought doe both, When Kings command them by their pow'rfull word. The Royall dignitie robb'd of this right, Is like mans bodie lacking soule, and spright. 110 Their care should be, to see the quarrell iust, Th' intent indeed religious, not in show: The Lord of Hosts likes not ambitious lust, The thoughts, though ne're so hidden, he doth know. Kings christ'ned, with their brothers need no brangling, To please the humours of Schoole-Doctors wrangling. 111 Is charitie 'mong Christians cleane forgot, The ancient badge of our diuine profession: Is Loue growne cold, and Hatred waxt so hot, Hath Malice in our hearts tane such possession, That no meane may be found to reconcile vs, Though Iewes, and Turks, and Pagans for't, reuile vs! 112 Doth not the common Foe behold our folly, Laugh in his sleeue to see vs play the fooles: That making shew to be deuout and holy, Against our selues we blunt our sharpned tooles? Meanewhile, our brawles prepare a way for him, Who hates vs all, into our seates to clim. 113 So gat he first the Empire of the East, Made slaues of those, who erst proud Scepters swayd: So hath he shrewdly shakt, and spoyl'd the West, Yea, had not God his furious madnesse stayd, The little left vs, should beene made his prey, And all constrayn'd his Scepter to obey. 114 A comparison of Esopes.Like Esops Frog and Mouse that stroue for place, Whereas for both there was enough, and spare: Though simple be the sample, it's our case, When 'tis too late, what boots it then beware? The Kite swept both those combatants away, Whil'st each of them, the other sought to slay. 115 This Vultures wings, vnlesse they had beene clipt, His talants par'd, his rau'nous beake well copt: Long since by him we had beene soundly gript, Our tallest spreading Cedars had beene lopt. Thanks to heau'ns King, who sent them orphan Lords, And caus'd them 'gainst th?selues imploy their swords. 116 As they are sinking, sooner may we rise, A Simile.Like Buckets in a Well: one goes downe emptie, Whilst it lowe logging in the water lies, It helps the other to come vp with plentie. By that meanes first their Bucket they did fill, So mought we ours, would we concurre in will. 117 He prayeth for vnitie among Christian Princes. Pro. 21. 1.Thou, in whose Hand are held the hearts of Kings, (Thy Substitutes, who rule by thy Commission) Thou turnest them like as the water-springs, Thou mak'st the people yeild to them submission: Encline their hearts to vnitie at length, That miscreants may feele their coupled strength. 118 What though my Muse cannot her wish obtaine? Yet while shee breathes, shee'll neuer cease so wishing. What, though it seeme her hopes are meerly vaine? As patient Anglers that delight in fishing, When fishes will not bite, they rest content, And thinke their time in angling not mis-spent. 119 The sinne which here in order next ensu'th, 7. Precept. Adulterie forbidden. All out of order spreading farre and wide: Some call't the proper vice of frolike youth, Yet old-age oft retaynes it by her side. “More hatefull 'tis, and lothsome to behold, Eccles. 25. 2. “When sinne of youth, surpriseth persons old. 120 This Precept curbeth young and old alike, Not them alone whom holy Rites haue bound: On these the Rod more heauily doth strike, The rest who faultie 'gainst this Law are found, Deut. 27. 26. Deut. 22. 28. Incurre like guilt, though not like penaltie: For, th' one must beare a mulct, the other die. Leu. 20. 10. 121 God well foresaw Man could not liue alone, All Creatures else had diff'rent sex in kind: An helpe he made him of his flesh and bone, Gen. 3. 21. In sacred Wedlock-bands he did them bind: That th' one of them might cleaue vnto the other, More then adhere to father, or to mother. 122 Though single life be held a blessed state, 1. Cor. 7. In such as haue the gift of Continence: Yet euery Man is free to take his Mate, So may each Woman doe without offence. To shunne the sinne of filthy Fornication, God knit that bond of Marriage-copulation. 123 The greater shame 'tis for a man of wealth, A Comparison. Whose fields are stor'd with herds, his chests with coyne: To spare his owne, supply himselfe by stealth, To rob his neighbours: shift, filch, and purloyne. A righteous King, such one to death did doome, 2. Sam. 12. Not knowing that himselfe supply'd the roome. 124 All Acts and Deeds of Lust are flat forbidden, So be the Thoughts that tend to wanton folly: For why, from God nor hearts, nor thoughts are hidden, 1. Pet. 1. 15.As he is, so his seruants must be holy: Not to the flesh, and sinfull pleasures prone, Like those who neuer had their Maker knowne. 125 Ecclus 23. 17. Pro. 3.Yet Wantons sweare, that stollen bread is sweet, Strange Womens lips, to honey they compare: The path to Hell they trample with their feet, Like Wood-cocks thrust their necks into a snare: Consume themselues in body, and in purse, Draw downe vpon their soules a heauie curse. 126 Mat. 5. 27.Our Master checkt the glancing of an eye, To stop this tainting poyson from the heart: A lustfull looke mounts to Adulterie, The Tempter vseth it as for his dart. So doth he garish toyes, and sugred baits, For hee's a close crafts-master in deceits. 127 A Comparison setting out the Diuells crafe in alluring vs to follie.An expert Captaine layes an ambuscado, His heedlesse foe the sooner to ensnare: Sends out some nimble troupes as in brauado, Who giue those fresh-men ground, till vnaware They fall within the circuit of the traine, Then all are captiues made, or downe-right slaine. 128 Thus fights th' old-Serpent 'gainst the soules of men, Giues Wantons leaue to frolike at their pleasure: So traynes them in; that hardly one of ten, Escapes the danger of his deadly seisure. No Vice so vastly in this Age doth swell, Nor sweepes so many multitudes to hell. 129 “Th' allurements are, excesse in clothes and diet: Sine Cerere &amp; Bacebo frige: Venus. “Th' one feedes the eye, the other fills the panch: “For Luxurie goes hand in hand with Riot, “And he that cannot keepe his body stanch, “But eates and drinkes profusely of the best, “Is apt to harbour Venus in his brest. 130 Why be the workes of Abstinence so prays'd, Ecclus. 31. 12. Rom. 13 13. As fasts, and slender food, the flesh to tame? But that thereby the soule is sweetly rays'd, From carnall thoughts, and deeds producing shame, To motions holy, sacred and diuine, Which our depraued nature doe refine. 131 Say (gentle Muse) what makes thee hang thy head, The Author taxeth the vanitie of lasciuious and wanton Poets: To close thine eyes from looking on the Light: To taint thy cheekes with an vnwonted red, To loath bright day, wish for the sable night; As if some deed of darknesse soyl'd thy name, And caus'd thee turne aside thy face for shame? 132 Shame 'tis in deed that makes me looke awrie: How can I with a modest view behold, The grosse abuse of gracefull Poetrie, In which all sacred Mysteries of old Were first divulg'd: God and good men extold, Each Vertue prays'd, and euery Vice controld? 133 Heroike deeds, high acts of Chiualrie, The true subiect of ancient Poesie. Exploits of noble Captaynes, and their Bands, Skie-knowledge course of Starres, Astronomie, Reports of dangers past by Seas and Lands: These were choise subiects in the elder times, Of Poets songs, and well-composed Rimes. 134 Now finest wits, enricht vpon Pernassus, Refresht with our sweet streames of Helicon: Reject our Maiden-precepts, and disgrace vs, They chose them wanton Theames to sing vpon: Wasting their braines about some idle toy, Of Citharea and her blinded boy. 135 A Simile.Sweet sounds the pipe whereon the Fowler playes, By which the Birds are trayned to his lure: Such is th' attractiue pow'r of Poets Layes, A gentle heart cannot th' assaults endure: The poyson slides so swift into each veine, As wounds to death, before one feele the paine. 136 This fuell feedes the soule-deuouring flame Of goatish lust, drawes tender youth to folly: For, what lewd sonets teach, these thinke no shame When they haue learn'd, to act it free and boldly. “No maruaile is't, for well we be instructed, “That by ill wordes, good manners are corrupted. 137 Sith then our sacred skill is thus profan'd, Our modest learning made a bawd to Vice: Our shame thereby in open streets proclaym'd, Our antique Vertue, valewed at no price: I'd rather blushing hide my Maiden face, Then bluntly to behold this soule disgrace. 138 Forbeare (my Muse) take not this thing to heart, Be not distraught for others so offending: Be chaste thy selfe, vse modest-virgin-art, So mayst thou be a meane of their amending. If one be won by imitating thee, Such one may after him draw two, or three. 139 Admit, some learn'd in Canon Lawes, or Ciuill, Or some professing Galens vsefull art: Say, some Diuines (whose bookes teach them no euill) Abuse their learning, play the lewd-mens part: Shall Physick, Lawes, sacred Theologie Lack their defence, and iust Apologie? 140 Not so. Nor may the sacred sisters nine, Reade Class. 2. Stan. 158. in defence of Poesie. So highly honour'd in all former ages: Whose off-spring and whose learning is diuine, So much esteem'd by Greeke, and Latine Sages: Be scorned for a few loose poetasters, Whose songs breed to their hearers some disasters. 141 You gentle wits deuoted to Apollo, Whose purer spirits doe most partake of fire: Shun subiects base, Celestiall still follow; Striue with the towring Larke, to mount vp higher: So bind your Muses to a modest song, That Enuie 't selfe may blush to doe them wrong. 142 Chase Venus and her sonne from out your Court, Take Vesta and her Virgins in their stead: Tell Wantons, here's no place for their lewd sport, Chaste Maides and Matrones, they alone must read Your hallowed spells; and men reclaym'd from folly, Vow'd in their liues and doctrines, to be holy. 143 Then Libertines; and men of brutish liues, That make a jest this Precept to transgresse, Corrupt young Virgins, tempt the sob'rest Wiues, Consume their precious time, in foule excesse, Thinke heau'n is onely in their Mistres armes, Detest (as hell) all sacred Doctors charmes: 144 Such men (I say) shall not approach your Cell, Their lips impure, shall not defile your name: They'll not ascend the Mount whereon you dwell, Nor haunt the Groues, wherein you walke, for shame. Your ancient glorie thus you shall attaine, Your Schollers grow in good mens grace againe. 145 8. Precept. Forbidding theft.Well doth the holy Text connect together, Those sinnes, which in this Table are forbid: The murth'rer, lecher, thiefe, false-witnesse-bearer, (Night-brats, who feare the light, wish to lie hid.) These doggue each other closely at the heele, As linkes in chaine, or spokes doe in a wheele. 146 That sacred Psalmist, of all Singers sweetest, Worthiest of Kings, 'mong Prophets the profoundest: Who knew what method in his Psalmes was meetest, Whose iudgement was in sprituall knowledge foundest: Psal. 56. 18, 19, 20.He ranked these as birds all of a feather, For commonly most of them flock together. 147 Next shedding bloud, and foule adulterie, The Law prescribes a strict restraint of theft: All things were neuer held in common, except by Adam and Eue: who may rather be said to haue had proprietie in all and so, no (forc't) community warranted since the creation. Gen 4. 2.What euery man holds in proprietie, That to the rightfull owner must be left. A tortious act it is, and open wrong, To take that which to others doth belong. 148 Promiscuous vse of euery thing in common, Which idle Iacks tumultuously doe craue: None euer had, since that first Man and Woman, To whom this Earth, and all therein, God gaue. For Abel had his stock, distinct from Caine: Communitie was not betwixt them twaine. 149 Then, that which Moses long time after wrote, Gods people practis'd since the first creation: Yet, to th' intent it might not be forgot, But left to each succeeding Generation, That holy man first writ it in a booke, And charg'd Gods people oft thereon to looke. 150 Steale not, saith God, which plainely doth inferre, This Precept doth auerre meum &amp; tuum. That things possest by thee, are iustly thine: Then Familists, and those false Bretheren erre, Who thinke all I haue, 's theirs aswell as mine. Those merrie Mates, if apprehended stealing; Say, they take but their owne, and that's plaine dealing. 151 Of theeues and robbers sundrie sorts there bee, Differences and degrees in theft. Though all transgressors 'gainst this Law diuine: Yet some runne further to impietie, Some from the precept barely doe decline. The punishments are diff'rently exprest, Which proues some worse offendors, then the rest. 152 When God is robb'd, can any sinne be greater? First, Church robberie or sacriledge is the worst theft. Mal 3. 8. Such theeues in elder times there haue beene found. It's strange to thinke that any mortall creature, Who sucks the aire, or sets his foot on ground, Should dare 'gainst God commit a robberie, And hope to doe it with impunitie. 153 One certaine plague alotted to such theeues, Amos 4. 6. Is, curses on their Land, and its encrease: To righteous men God store and plentie giues, Their Barnes are full, they sowe and reape in peace. Who knowes himselfe delinquent in this sinne, Should retribute, and fall no more therein. 154 To spoile the Church, or Church-men of their right, That's sacriledge, God thereby suffers wrong: Though done in secret, once 'twill come to light, Th' offendors seldome prosper with it long. My friend that in this case hath done amisse, I wish make God amends, and get his blisse. 155 Some Clergie-men, worse then the Laitie, Are said to rob the Church, mens soules to kill: Scarse fit for one, hold soule-cures two, or three, With wooll their backs doe cloth, their bellies fill With sheepes sweet milke: their flocks the whiles vnfed. If some such bad men liue, 'tis time th' were men-ded. 156 Secondly, Tyrants that oppresse and rob the world.Some Tyrants great in pow'r by Sea and Land, Rest vnsuffic'd with that which God hath lent them: Though many Kingdomes lie at their command, There's nought but all the world can content them: Like Macedonian Philips stirring sonne, Who wept sith yet one world he had not wonne. 157 These be great theeues that rob the vniuerse, Suppose this All was for themselues created: Grow proud, cause after-ages shall rehearse, How many Lands, and Kings they ruinated. Or these men breake this Law forbidding theft, Or of my iudgement I am cleane bereft. 158 I iudge those Monarks blest in their estates, (And sure I am herein my iudgement's right.) Who giue no cause of quarrels and debates, For iust and lawfull causes onely fight: Till wrong be offred them, doe not begin: Stick closely to their taske, when once they're in. 159 Dread Lord, vouchsafe to heare a lowly Swaine, An Apostrophe to the Kings Maiestie. Whose Muse (presuming on your former grace) First humbly prayes you long in peace may raigne, And leaue it firme vnto your Royall race. All let's remou'd that to a breach doe tend, Each enemie of yours, turn'd trustie friend. 160 Next vote of mine depends vpon condition, (I take it from a holy man of God) Deut. 10. 10. If Peace into their hearts get no admission, By whom your children vnder foot are trod; The fault is theirs, strayne curt'sie then no longer, Your quarrell being iust, you are the stronger. 161 More smooth then supplest oile haue beene their wordes, Psal. 55. 22 What time sterne Mars did harbour in their hearts: Seeming to heale (as balme) they cut like swordes, Wounding farre deeper then the sharpest darts. Accept a subiects vote, though bluntly spoken; Let not your head, with their sweet balmes be broken. Psal. 141. 5. 162 It's better from our friend to beare a stroake, Psalm. 141. 5. Prou. 28. 6. Take wordes that to the eare may sound vnpleasing: Then kisses from our foes: whereby they cloake. Disguise their falshood, trecherie, and leasing. Two great wise Kings who found this true by proofe, Haue writ it in their bookes for our behoofe. 163 Take graciously, what loyally is meant, (I onely wish, too weake to giue aduise) My pen sets freely downe my hearts intent, I know the King, to whom I speake, is wise. Act. 26. 26. Graunts pardon to ingenuous libertie, When dutie bounds it with humilitie. 164 3. Robbing a Realme, or Commonwealth,To rob the Kingdome, or the Common-wealth, Wherein one had his birth, and hath his being: This seemes to me a most accursed stealth, Some know't, yet winke as if they wanted seeing. If any such there be within this Land, I wish they were vpon the mending hand. 165 By indirect deceauing their Prince.If any by close tricks abuse their Prince, Through faire pretence of doing him good seruice: If they his treasure, and reuenewes mince, Whereby themselues to great estates doe rise, Without desert to King, or Common-weale: What if one aske you, whether such men steale? 166 By bribery and Extortion.If Magistrates, and Officers extort, Take Gifts and Bribes, which blinde eu'n wise mens eyes: Exod. 23. 8. Mat. 3. 5.It's like at length they may be plagued for't, Sith God doth heare oppressed poore mens cryes: Ier. 22. 13.For such misdeedes roots-out the Generation Of wicked men: and oft subuerts a Nation. 167 By defrauding Orphanes, Widowes, and poore of their right.If men (for friends and wealth) of mickle might, (Whose conscience is as large as Friars sleeues) Rob Orphanes, Widdowes, poore men of their right, And vnder shew of Iustice, play the theeues. This Precept strikes at them, as at the others, They may shake hands, and passe for sworne-brothers. 168 By betraying poore Clients Causes.If Aduocates receaue poore Sutors fees, Giue wrong aduise, make Causes bad, seeme best: Regard not whether Clients winne, or leese, So they grow rich, and feather well their nest: A sinne it is against this Law, I take it: If any haue so done, let them forsake it. 169 By Moses Law, Theeues were but to restore, Restitution ordayned for theft, by Moses. Exod. 22. Pro. 6. 31. For Chattle-theft no man was iudg'd to die, But onely render fow'r for one, or more: All Nations now haue chang'd that penaltie. I'll not dispute the Cause that mou'd them to it, Th' effect appeares: for euery where they doe it. 170 The Trade of Theft, and Robbing is so rife, 'Gainst Nations lawes, and Mans societie, They'll venter on't, with hazard of their life: Worke? Fie vpon't, they rather choose to die. Such as be trayn'd vp idly in their youth, Will sooner hang, then sweat and liue by truth. 171 They onely thinke on bodies punishment, Feare but the mulct, and outward penaltie: Consider not, how when the bodie's spent, The Soule, assenting to the felonie, Before another Iudge must take her triall, Confesse the fault, for there bootes no deniall. 172 Those subtle Theeues, more cunning then the rest, Theft by false play; and cheating. Which rob by shifts, false play, and craftie cheating: Hold fast in earnest what they get in jest, Scape scot-free without hanging, either beating: Are but repriued to a further day, To beare a heauier check for their foule-play. 173 Christs doctrine is so full of pietie, So pearcing to the heart, and inward thought, So set on Iustice, Truth, and Charitie, From fau'ring, farre: or cloaking, what is naught: That it forbids all fraud, deceipt, and guile, 1. Thes. 4. 6. Luk. 12. 33. and 18. 22. Bids giue our goods, though lackt our selues, somewhile. 174 A richman that doth not almes-deeds, robs the poore.It's not enough t' abstayne from open stealing, Liue on thy owne, forbeare to filch from others: Thou must giue Almes, vse liberall and free dealing, If thou haue store, releeue thy needie brothers. Ecclus 4 1.For, he that's rich, and doth not helpe the poore, Defraudes them of their due. I vrge no more. 175 Suffice it what hath on this Theame beene said, A further search remaynes for greater Clarkes: Perhaps, if Towne and Countrie were suruey'd, True men from Theeues, distinguisht by these markes: A young Arithmeticians braynes 'twould cumber, To tell in haste, which were the greater number. 176 9. Precept. Against false witnesse.You neuer knew a Thiefe, but was a Lyar, Twins laughing still, and weeping both together: The smoke clings not more closely to the fier, Beware them both alike, put trust in neither. Theeues preying on our goods, lesse hurtfull are, Then Witnesses that lye, and falsely sweare. 178 The Precepts ten, so firmely are connext, That breaking one, we faile in all the rest: Iam. 2. 10.So I haue learned in the holy Text, Gods curse is got, by sinning in the least: Yet (well conceau'd) it may be rightly spoken, One hurts more, then another, being broken. 178 The heynousnesse of false Testimonie; To God, and Men.A Witnesse speaking falsly on his oath, Assumes in vaine Gods great and fearefull Name: Of life and liuelyhood he robs vs both, Oft-times bereaues vs of our honest fame. Pro. 6. 19.Such false Truth-wresters, Breeders of debate, Are they whom God especially doth hate. 179 Their punishment iust Moses doth appoint, When Iudges hap their falshood to discouer: Life must be had for life, and ioynt for ioynt, Deut. 19. 16. Doe to him, as he would haue done to th' other. Susannaes false accusers had such hire, Dan. 13. As they to lay vpon her, did conspire. 180 Naboth was charg'd to haue blasphem'd the King, 1. King. 21. Two sonnes of Belial wickedly bely'de him: He neuer thought, nor dreamt of such a thing, Yet of his life, and land, false oathes depriu'd him. By such a trick, our Lord was circumuented, Matth. 26. 59. The Priests themselues that treacherie inuented. 181 The great Law-giuer wisely did foresee, What danger periur'd witnesses might breed: He therefore wrote, that two at least, or three Deut. 19. 15. Must proue, before a matter be decreed. One, was too few: and many, hard to get: Two at the least, or three, were fitly set. 182 And yet, th' old Serpent, father of all lyes, To whom the naked Truth is most displeasing: By many shifts and glozes doth deuize, To set vp falshood, periurie, and leazing. With sundrie men, he worketh sundrie wayes, As each one is enclin'd, his bait he layes. 183 'Mong passions all, that draw a man to sinne, Enuie, Malice, Hatred, are strong passions inciting to false witnesse. Hate, Malice, Enuie beare the greatest sway: Who to his heart, once lets these Monsters in, They leade him downe to hell the readie way. In their designes, they are so fierce and strong, They'll haue their purpose, bee't by right, or wrong. 184 Saint Steuens false accusers. Act. 6. 13.The men who with Saint Steuen did dispute, Vnable to resist his Arguments, The Spirit by which he spake, stroke them all mute: For spite whereof their heart insunder rents. False witnesses suborned, doe accuse him, So by their hate, and malice they abuse him. 185 Act. 7. 60.They charge this holy man with blasphemie, (An odious crime in sight of God, and Men) Then martyr him: who full of charitie Kneeles downe, and most deuoutly prayes for them. Thus Testimonie, meant for furth'ring right, The wicked doe peruert, to wreake their spite. 186 A Simile.The Leuell, and the Square, fram'd for a guide, Whereby each skilfull Builder leades his worke: Once set a wrie, then th' architect goes wide, In fine is carried cleane beside the marke. So Witnesse, whereon Iudgements should be grounded, If false, all right is thereby quite confounded. 187 Feare &amp; fauour of great persons.Some, are so fearefull of a great-mans frowne, So glad to wind themselues into his grace: Their soules at stake they wilfully lay downe, To get the smiling aspect of his face. 1. King. 21.Those elders swayd by Iesabels damn'd letter, Were such lewd Mates. I cannot terme them better. 188 Lands, dignities, and promotions. 2. Sam. 16. 4.Lands, Offices, and Dignities doe much, The hope of these doth many moe entice: Mephiboshets false seruitour was such, A slander 'gainst his Lord he did deuise: So got possession of his whole estate. Let all men blesse themselues from such a Mate. 189 What is't, that money cannot bring to passe? Money the common corrupter of witnesses. “Makes crooked things seeme straight, turnes blacke to white: This may wee see as cleere as in a glasse: The Souldiers sware, that while they slept by night, Matth. 28. 12. Our Lords Disciples stole him from his Tombe: 'Twas money made them speake, else they'd bin dumbe. 190 Who hunts, an old and craftie Fox to catch, A Simile. Goes warily to worke ere he can get him: On all sides of the wood, leaues some to watch, When out he runnes, there roundly doth beset him, Not leauing him a hole wherein to hide, His wiles then faile him, in the Champion wide. 191 So, reuerend Iudges deale with cunning Mates, Suspected to relye on subornation: Note what each Witnesse seuerally relates, Dan. 13. 48. Marke circumstances breeding alteration: A Truth cannot so closely be deny'de, Nor Falshood voucht, but 'tis by them descry'de. 192 For they (on earth) are Gods, whose seat they hold, 2. Sam. 14. 20. and 19. 27. A Truth from Falshood quickly they espie: Let no false-witnesse-bearer be so bold, As hope he may out-face them with a lie. Nay, God in heau'n, and Gods on earth agree, Both here and there, to punish periurie. 193 The Law, though branching into many parts, 10. Precept. Couet nothing of thy Neighbours: Matth. 22. 37. Rom. 13. 9. Is briefly couched in a word or twaine: First, to loue God sincerely with our hearts; Then, Neighbours as our selues. (Cold loue is vaine.) Giue freely all to God, that's to him due: Wish nought from Neighbours, that longs not to you. 194 The lesson's short, soone learned out of booke, And may be all obseru'd: (as some haue thought) Matth. 19. 20. Pro 20 9. and 1. Iob. 1. 8. Gen. 6. 5. and Iob 4. 18.That young man in the Gospell much mistooke, We otherwise in holy Writ are taught. No thoughts are so vpright, no heart so pure, That can the censure of this Law endure. 195 The least desire, or coueting from others, makes vs guiltie of the whole Law.This Precept, shutting vp the Second Table, Requires such cleannesse in the heart of man: Presumption 'twere to thinke a mortall able To keepe it strictly, doe what ere he can. The best who shunne grosse sinnes (be sure of this) Cannot but wish oft-times, and thinke amisse. 196 To loue thy friend of whom thou art belou'd, Doe good to him, who doth as much for thee: True charitie is thereby faintly prou'd, Matth. 5. 44.For wicked men so farre in loue agree. But we must loue our foes, that most defie vs: Wish well to those, who slander and belie vs. 197 Matth. 19. 18. Rom. 13. 9.Herein the six last Precepts are obay'd, If, as our selues, so we our neighbour loue. This is the summe of all that can be said, Examine well thy selfe thereby to proue, If thoughts, and deedes walke not sometimes awrie, So learne to know thy owne infirmitie. 198 Sundrie Similes, shewing the good vse of the Law, albeit we cannot fulfill it.He that with inward sicknesse is surpriz'd, Whose griefe growes closely on him vndescri'de, Scarse feeles his paine: that man is misaduiz'd, No greater danger can such one betide. To goe astray, and thinke thou walkest right, All's one, as take the Darknesse for the Light. 199 The wound that's deepe, yet taken as a scarre, Endangers most the body that endures it: That Feed-man oft his Clients cause doth marre, Who ere he fully knowes, rashly assures it. The Pharise, selfe-soothed holy man, Luk 18. Came short in goodnesse of the Publican. 200 The Law layes ope our sicknesse, and our sore, Instructs vs where, and when we goe astray: Declares our case as 'tis, nor lesse, nor more, Our faults vnmaskt, before vs it doth lay So when wee see our wretchednesse, and errour, It strikes into our hearts a holy terrour. 201 This terrour doth our in-bred pride abate, Leades to repentance, and humilitie: Makes vs renounce our selues, our sinnes to hate, Driues all to haue recourse for remedie, By him who kept the Law in euery jot, Gal. 3. Esay 53. Yet suffred death, which he deserued not: 202 To quit that debt which we should haue discharg'd, Or lyen in Iayle, till th' vtmost farthing payd: From prison by his gift we were enlarg'd, Not one mite left, that on vs could be layd. Each one who humbly sues for his acquittance, Is well-com'd in, and findes a free admittance. 203 Thus doe good Christians Moses Law expound, (The rule of Iustice, and of Righteousnesse) We build our Doctrine on no other ground, Though Iewes, and Turkes pretend to doe no lesse: Yet they stick onely to the outward Letter, Rom. 2. 25. We ioyne thereto the Spirit: and that is better. 204 My Muse craues further time to end this song, That sacred Theame requires more meditation: The Parts alreadie sung, haue held her long. Here tenders shee her humble Supplication; Sir, begs your pardon for all faults, and slips; Your Princely hand, to grace her Virgin-lips. The end of the fourth Classis. The fift Classis. THE ARGVMENT. Our Sauiours method most diuine in teaching. Repentance first: Beatitudes and Woes: Loue, Almes, Fasts, Prayer, subiects of his preaching: His perfect forme of prayer for a cloze. In Parables our lessons he doth reade vs, His Flesh and Bloud made speciall foode to feede vs. 1 The prouerb tells what proofe confirmes for true, Some marre good matters, handling of them ill: Some by their cunning vent old stuffe for new, Make blacke seeme white. (There's falshood in that skill.) A worthy subiect handled in it's kinde, Approues it selfe to euery honest minde. 2 The first who fully writ of things diuine, I find not that Moses writ ought, before he receaued the Tables written by God in the Mount. Deut. 5. 22. At Gods owne hand receau'd it readie penn'd: He from that modell neuer did decline, Propos'd vnto himselfe no other end. That compasse was his guide to saile aright, Taught him whereof, and in what stile to write. 3 Yet after him among the Iewish Tribes, Succeeded some who on his chaire did sit: Proud Pharizees, selfe-wise-conceited Scribes, Matth. 16. 6. 12. and 26. 57. &amp; Mar. 14. 64. Abus'd the Law, and mis-expounded it. True Doctrine they accus'd as blasphemie, Against the Law, adiudg'd The Iust to die. 4 Matth 23. 2, 3.When to the people they sound lessons taught, (As listning to their charge, most-times they did.) Then commonly their liues were loose and naught, Hypocrisie within their hearts lay hid. “What boots it, of Gods vpright Law to talke, “And in the Deuils crooked wayes to walke? 5 Moses a type of Christ.A perfect patterne of sinceritie In life and doctrine, Moses shadow'd out: My humble Muse deuotes her ingenie To trace them both. (Well may shee bring't about) A weightie load, too great for her to beare; Yet light, if he vouchsafe the burthen share. 6 A prayer for assistance in this diuine taske.Then thou, whose tongue spake neuer but the troth, Whose actions all, were rules of pietie; Direct my hand and heart to treat of both, (Instructed by the Sacred Historie) In modest meeter, that the grau'st Diuine, May say, the Sprite, that rul'd the pen, was thine. 7 Iam. 1. 17.For, euery worke that any good hath in it, Proceedes from thee, the God of Truth and Light; Thy Spirit helps to end, and to begin it, All glorie vnto thee belongs of right. The good that's here, and worthy prayse, 'tis thine; The faults and errours, I confesse, be mine. 8 The ground of Doctrines lately hath beene laid, The roote and branches both describ'd at full; Of circumstances much rests to be said, That grace and pow'r of speech, whereby the dull Hard hearted Iew, the Gentile-Idoll-monger, Were forc't to yeild to him, as to the stronger. 9 When Officers were sent abroad to watch him, Iob. 7. 32 The Priests enjoyning it by strict command: Though some of them were fully bent to catch him, Yet none had pow'r to lay on him a hand. Vers. 44. 45, 46. Their answere was (when they were checkt therefore) Like vnto him, neuer spake man before. 10 Is't not obserued in the holy Booke, Luk. 4. 16 At Nazareth, when first he 'gan to preach, How stedfastly all people on him looke, Wonder to heare how sweetly he doth teach? Matth. 7. 28. Mar. 1. 22. Vnlike the Scribes, whose wordes had no such force, To worke in th' hearers pitie, or remorse. 11 Tertellus trusting to his Oratorie, Act. 24 Suppos'd to daunt poore Paul, and strike him mute, In his affected stile he tooke a glorie; The pris'ner doth this Orator confute. Bribe-louing-Felix could not so dissemble, Vers 25. But that Pauls peircing speeches made him tremble 12 He from his Lord receau'd such forcefull pow'r, Mar. 13. 11 and Luk. 21. 14. Who left this comfort to his Schollers all: That when they needed most, eu'n in that how'r, No Tyrants furie might their hearts appall; His Sprite would teach them speake with such a grace, As should confound their foe-men in the place. 13 Confound their foes, confirme the faith of others, 2. Cor. 2. (Two strange effects proceeding from one breath) Make reprobates of some, of some make brothers; To these giue life; to those bring shame and death. That Word alone so sharpe and peircing is, Of th' end to which it aymes, doth neuer misse. 14 My silly Muse, how darst thou soare so high, Neglecting danger of a dreadfull fall? How may thy flaggie wings beare thee so nigh That glorious Sunne, whose brightnesse dazels all? “Dispose thy selfe vnto some lower pitch, “Mounting too high, makes some lye in the ditch. 15 “Yet humble men that downwards cast their eyes, “All-dis-esteeme themselues, confesse their vildnesse, “Thinke th' are vnworthy to behold the skyes: “Recounting their Redeemers grace and mildnesse, “May fix their towring thoughts on his high Palace, “Scorne earthly, and in heauenly things take solace. 16 Matth. 11. 25.“Things vndiscouer'd to the worldly-wise, “To Babes and Children God oft-times reueales; Ioh. 12. 40.“He shuts the ones, sets ope the others eyes, “Expounds to some, from other some conceales: Matth. 7. 7.“Instructing vs to aske, to seeke, to knocke, “That we may haue, and he the doore vnlocke. 17 Now giue me Lord, what faithfully I aske; Guide me to finde the Treasure that I seeke: The skill to handle well this heauenly taske, Which none can doe, but humble men, and meeke. “For pride strikes her possessors all so blinde, Similes or Comparisons, expressing the care and diligence of our Sauiour in his teaching, to heale soule-sicke men, and leade them to heauen.“The path that leades to blisse, they neuer finde. 18 A good Physitian caring for the sick, Of whom he once doth vndertake the cure; Casts not how he his Patients purse may pick, Or lingring make him longer paine endure. But bends his wits to know the maladie, Then by his Art, prouides a remedie. 19 A faithfull Pilot hauing tane the charge, To passe Sea-faring men to their owne Land; The Passengers once shipped in his Barge, Their goods and liues deliuered to his hand; Aduizing of the trust to him committed, Takes care that for the voyage all be fitted. 20 An Aduocate to whose fidelitie, Poore Clients causes wholly are commended, When liues and liuel'hood stand in ieopardie; Till those great causes thoroughly be ended, Giues not himselfe to idlenesse and plesure, But in that bus'nesse spends his how'rs of leasure. 21 Our best Physician, Pilot, Aduocate; Who freely vndertooke to heale each griefe; To bring home wandring soules, to heau'ns straight gate; Vn-feed, to pleade for euery man's reliefe: Neglects no time, lets no occasion slide, Fit salues for euery sore he doth prouide. 22 Strong purges, bitter pills, sharpe corrasiues, To some he giues as sicknesses require: To some sweet Iulips, sound restoratiues, Expecting neither fee, reward, nor hire. He offers helpe to all, if all would take it; Most see not their owne want, and'so forsake it. 23 One ground-worke for all sick-soule-cure he laid, Repentance the first Doctrine that Christ &amp; his Harbinger Iohn Baptist taught. Matth. 3. 2, and 4 17. His Harbinger before him had beene sent, To worke on that: for so 'tis plainly said, They both began with one selfe word, Repent. “Who thinks he's sound enough, and no help needeth. “Must die of that disease, whose roote he feedeth. 24 Matth. 9. and Mar. 2. 17.To righteous men (that to themselues so seeme, And so by others falsely iudg'd to bee, Such as did thinke they had no lack of him) To call these men, I am not sent, saith hee. They must both know, and knowledge their owne need, That would b'assured of my helpe to speed. 25 “Doubtlesse there is no other way to heale, “When men are deadly sick, and will not see't; “But cause them tell their griefe which they conceale, “Disclose't to him, who knowes what helpe is meet Our Medic thus his practice did begin The cure failes none, that rightly enter in. 26 No wit, nor art of man (say I) is able, (Though all their art and wits were ioyn'd together) So pithily as he in one Parable, By speech or writing to perswade the Hearer, To turne from folly, and returne to God, When he reclaymes vs with his gentle rod. 27 The most excellent pithy parable of the prodigall sonne. Luk. 15. 11. to the end of the chapter.That sonne which wilfully forsooke his father, Consum'd his goods with luxurie and riot, When all was gone, no meanes left more to gather, Swine-offals fayling him (a wretched diet) To fill his panch, the hunger was so great, Fayne would he beene suffic'd with such course meat 28 What doth he then? begins to change his minde, Thinks on the plentie, at his fathers table: In hope to haue him pittifull and kinde, Once more will gayne his grace, if he be able; Confesse his fault, vnworthy name of sonne, Craue but a seruants place: so home doth runne. 29 No sooner homeward turneth he his face, The father hast'ning, meets him halfe the way; Embraceth him, receaues him into grace, With shooes, and ring, and robe, doth him array: A fatted Calfe he kills, and makes a feast, With mirth and minstrelsie to please this Ghest. 30 Nay more, when th' elder brother 'gan repine, To see this vnthrift Lad so entertayn'd, The father prayes him to come in and dine, For why? My sonne was lost and is regayn'd. I thought he had beene dead, but since hee's liuing, We must reioyce, and cheere our hearts from grieuing. 31 A short discourse it is, yet most diuine, Most full of grace, most pithy to perswade; Displayes our wretched state before our eyne, Points out the way by which our peace is made: Our heauenly father's pronenesse to forgiue, Would no mans death, but that he turne and liue. Izech. 33. 11. 32 The same by two like samples he auerreth. Among an hundred sheepe if one be lost, Luk. 15. Or one poore groat 'mong ten: the loser stirreth, The fields are searcht, the stuffe i'th' house is tost: That lost-sheepe found, giues th' owner more content, Then all the rest that straying neuer went. 33 The Angels all, for ioy in heauen showt, To see a man whose steps to hell-ward tended, Reclayme himselfe, his course turn'd cleane about, His faults forsaken, and his life amended. There's naught (me thinks) can cause that man be sad, Which walkes the way, that makes good Angels glad. 34 Can any gracelesse trewant be so mad, Though once he plaid the foole to goe astray; Being well assur'd his pardon may be had, His welcome more, then ere he went away, As not returne to rest, and liue with store, But begge, or steale, and lastly hang therefore? 35 If such there be (too many sure there are) That loue to feed on huskes, and liue with Hogs: Within the Citie gates, they get no share, Reuel. 22. 15. Matth. 25. 10.But out they must abide among the Dogs. “When doores be shut once, there's no comming in “It's best while men haue time, in time begin. 36 Christs heauenly Sermon in the Mount. Matth. 5.His hearers thus prepar'd to lend their eare, A sermon he begins; wherein each line Is full of weight; excites to loue, and feare, To knowledge him a Preacher most diuine. Great Doctors on that Theame, great Books may write, My Muse briefe Poems onely must indite. 37 A Simile.(Like Bee among the flowr's about shee goes, The Wax and Honey labours how to finde: Though venom'd herbe none in this Garden growes, Yet Spiders are so spitefull by their kinde, The wholsom'st herb, and sweetest flow'r in fields, Some poyson to their cancred nature yeilds.) 38 The eight Beatitudes. Matth. 5.He teacheth first what sort of men be blest, The fruit to euery blessing is annext; Eight in their rankes distinctly are exprest, So shall you finde them in the sacred Text; And noting well the opposites to those, Discerne who are accurst, and see their woes. 39 Blest (in the fore-ranke) be the poore in Spirit, 1. Poore in Spirit. He meanes not all that liue in beggerie: For rich as well as poore may heau'n inherit, So they be fraught with sp'rituall pouertie. “A poore man may be prowd, of God detested: Ecclus. 25. 2. “Then blisse in all poore men is not inuested. 40 Some beggar-bare, soule-decking riches wanting, Reuel. 3. 17. and 18. 7. Perswade themselues to haue enough, and spare; Such, of their sp'rituall wealth are euer vaunting, These men had need prouide them better ware: Least being found their wedding garment lacking They be thrust out of doores, and hunted packing. 41 Some others truly rich, yet make no shew, Reuel. 2. 9. Their treasures lie close hidden in their heart: These be the better sort, though they be few, In this Beatitude they haue their part. Are poore in spirit blest? heau'ns ioyes obtaine? Then sp'rituall prowd, in hell must suffer paine. 42 Such be those men (to make the matter cleerer, Sith contraries set one by th' others side, Doe best appeare when they are ioyn'd the neerer.) Who in their gifts and graces take a pride, Luk. 18. Extoll themselues as men of much perfection, And thinke all others owe to them subiection. 43 Next blessednesse, to Mourners is allotted: 2. Mourners. 2. Sam. 14. 2. &amp;c Not such as walke in black for friends departed, Whose inner vest'ments oft-times are bespotted, Their garments sad, themselues not heauie hearted. Such kind of mourning, cannot make men blest; To take it so, were th' holy Sense to wrest. 44 True mourning, whereby blessednesse is gayned, Hath other ground, aymes at a better end: It must be from the heart, and not be feyned, Arise from euill deeds, that God offend: Psal. 119. 53. 158.Like his, who mourn'd and grieued at the heart, When wicked men from Gods Law did depart. 45 Psal. 38. &amp; 51. and full thoroughout his Psalmes.So when himselfe through frailtie did amisse, When Church, or Common-wealth endur'd affliction; He prayes and mournes, and rents his heart for this. Herein he shared in this benediction. For such occasions, after he had mourned, His heauinesse to mirth, and ioy were turned. 46 What shall we thinke (on th' other side) of those, That laugh and jest, when godly men are mourning? It's like in time their mirth may turne to woes, When th' other are at rest, these may be burning. Luk. 16.The Glutton glutted late with wine, soone after Begg'd hard, and mist to get one drop of water. 47 3. Meeke.Now come yee meeke, and humble men of heart, You gentle harmelesse soules, by worldlings scorn'd; Among the Blessed you must haue your part, Your lowlinesse, shall highly be adorn'd. Psal 37. 11.The Earth to you is giu'n, and to your seed, Take that as part, and portion of your meed. 48 With rest and peace your dwellings shall abound, Your selues delighted in that happy state; Fierce-firie-sprighted men God will confound, That stirring race of people he doth hate. 'Mong Beares, and Woolues, in some poore Hermits cell I'd rather liue, then neare such Furies dwell. 49 A man with thirst, and hunger hardly prest, 4. Hunger and thirst for Righteousnesse. His belly euer thinkes his throat is cut: He neuer sleepes, nor walkes, nor sits in rest, Till meat and drinke be got, to fill his gut. That being had, affoords him more content, Then richest pearles from farthest Orient. 50 Some thirst for gold, as others doe for drinke; They hunger after wealth, no lesse then meat; Such thirst and hunger, here you may not thinke Are vnderstood, nor belly-cheere to eat. To hunger much and thirst for righteousnesse, Is that for which Our Sauiour here doth blesse. 51 “A blessed thirst indeed, and yet a feast; “A holy hunger, 'mid great store of cates; “Well is the man that sits here as a ghest, “Blest he that at this banquet drinkes, and eates. “This hunger, and this thirst, the Soule so feedeth; “The more's her appetite, the lesse shee needeth. 52 “Here, food and feeding both are sp'rituall, “An earnest longing of the Soule and Heart, “To doe the workes of Iustice vnto all, “Lewd liuers from their follies to conuert; “To helpe the poore oppressed, to their right; “Defend the feeble from a man of might. 53 Who thus-wise hunger, either thirst endureth, Shall haue his fill of that for which he longeth; The Text each faithfull man thereof assureth, And who so doubts of that, the Preacher wrongeth. Such as to Iustice haue no appetite, Their state's the worse, they get no blessing by't. 54 5. Mercifull.The workes of Mercy highly are commended, And their reward (in sort) exceedes the rest: For by the scope of Scripture 'tis intended Without Gods mercy, no man can be blest. Rom. 6. 23.“Not merit, but his mercy freely giuen, “To true beleeuers, opes the gates of heauen. 55 This sauing-mercy those alone shall find, That cheerfully shew mercy vnto other; Who can expect his father should be kind To him, which deales vnkindly with his brother? Pro. 21. 13.“The mercifull like mercy shall obtaine, “Men mercilesse, shall looke for it in vaine. 56 Matth. 18. 23.That gracelesse seruant fully cleeres the case, Who ow'd his Lord an endlesse masse of debt: And hauing nought to pay, yet out of grace, Vpon request, at libertie was set. He should haue done, as he was done vnto, But soone forgot, what he was bound to doe. 57 He takes his fellow-seruant by the throat, For such a pelting debt, as (to his owne) Deseru'd not to be valued at a groat: This dealing to his master being knowne, He bids the Iaylors take him to their charge, To pay each farthing, ere he goe at large. 58 Mongst workes of Mercy there be many more: To visit sick, giue ayde to men distressed, To clothe the naked, to releeue the poore, For these, and such like workes, we shall be blessed. Matth. 25. 41.These duties, he that wilfully neglects, A curse vpon himselfe, and his reflects. 59 Blest be the Pure. Not such as seeming so, 6. Pure in heart. Pro. 30. 12. Are full of spots, and filthinesse within: Not such as make of puritie a show, Yet loosely liue, lye wallowing in their sin. Math. 23. 25. 'Tis puritie in heart that God desires, Iob. 4. 24. Our heart's the thing, that he of vs requires. Pro. 23. 26. 60 Can any man pronounce, My heart is cleane, Iob. 15. 14. Pro. 20. 9. Sith heauens in his sight appeare impure? Yes, those which by his bloud haue washed beene, Psal. 51. &amp; Act. 15. 9. Whom faith hath purged. Such be clensed sure: Who with the Sow, returne not to the mire, 2. Pet. 2. 22. But to liue cleanly afterwards, desire. 61 To these the promise in the Text is giuen, To see their God, aye to behold his face, To passe from darknesse to the light of heauen, T'ascend Gods Hill, rest in his holy place. Ps. 24. 4. Where shall th' impure, and cancred-hearted dwell? I know no Mansion for them but in Hell. 62 Peace-Makers likewise are pronounced blest, 7. Peace makers. Beati Pacifici, see there at large. (Of these my Muse hath sung with some delight) The priuiledge they haue, is not the least, Gods children they be styl'd: it is their right. The Deuils brats needes must those others bee, That wilfully breake peace, and vnitie. 63 Blest be all those that persecution suffer 8. Persecution for Christs sake For Righteousnesse and Truth, and for Christs sake: When men reuile vs, raile, all wrongs doe offer, And we with patience gladly doe it take. Here, heau'n's not barely promis't for reward, But great encrease of blisse in that regard. 64 “All-suffring is not priuiledg'd with blessing, “The paine makes not a Martyr, but the Cause: 1. Pet. 2. 20. and 4. 15.In sundrie places we be taught this lesson, When malefactors suffer by the Lawes: Such suffring is not truly Persecution, But rather termed Legall execution. 65 Matth. 10. 33.On th' other side, when we are put to triall, Religion, Faith, and Conscience laid at stake: If feare, or ought else force vs to deniall, Our faith renounce, our Sauiour to forsake: At latter day hee'll say to vs, be gone; Denie vs, as we erst by him had done. 66 The Philosophers folly in the search of Felicitie, or blessednesse.Loe here, eight easie steps to blessed state, Fram'd by a perfect Architect indeed: Philosophers were readie fall to bate, All searcht to find the thing, but could not see't. One said 'twas this, another said 'twas that, Some lost themselues, and said they knew not what. 67 A Comparison.Like Fooles shut vp in a Dedalian maze, A spacious one, with roome enough to wander: Well might they runne, or walke, or stand and gaze, No sooner find th' way out, then could a Gander. This laberinth constrayn'd them all to dote, To speake their mindes, and tell their tales by rote. 68 Anoter Simile or Comparison.What maruaile, if a man depriu'd of sight, Set in a Wildernesse, or Forest wide, Where thousands are of wayes: yet but one right, And all the rest diuerting him aside: If he (I say) 'mong thousands, misse that one, Though he should walke there, till the day of doome? 69 “Our eyes brooke not the brightnesse of the Sunne, “Celestiall things surmount our reasons reach: “Beatitude by other meanes is wonne, “Then such as Heathen-men were able teach. The man from whom these lessons we receau'd, Was God and Man, and could not be deceau'd. 70 Here for a Corollarie it would fit well, From Gerizim, Mount Ebal to ascend: Deut. 11. 29. Of woes likewise in number eight, to tell, Whereon our Lord was pleas'd some wordes to spend: But first our Preachers foot-steps must be trac't, The rest pursu'de, as in the Text it's plac't. 71 The prime part of this heau'nly Sermon ended, Beatitudes to pious workes assign'd: More precepts to his hearers he commended, By which their liues and manners were refin'd. The Scribes delighted of the Law to talke, But made no conscience after it to walke. 72 Th' Apostles, and all Preachers of the Word. The dutie of Preachers and Pastors. He shewes what manner men they ought to bee: Their liues should with their doctrine well accord, In vertue they must shine; that men may see, And seeing render glorie to his Name, Who giues them grace, and pow're to doe the same. 73 He came not to destroy, but to fulfill; Not to obscure the Law, but to explaine: He taught them truly what it was to kill, See. before in Class. 4. St. 90. &amp;c. Breake wedlock, take the name of God in vaine. Each other Precept rightly he expounded, Which Scribes by their false glosses had confounded. 74 As it was with Moses. Psal. 78.Two things true Doctrine strongly doe approue, Great miracles in which Gods hand appeares: Strange signes and wonders shew'd downe from aboue, Which tell the eyes, as wordes doe to the eares. Iob. 6. 30.The Iewes requir'd that he a signe would giue, To th' end they might behold it, and beleeue. 75 Of these they had so great, and so great store, In Class. 3. all throughout.(Whereof at large I haue alreadie spoken) That Moses neuer gaue their fathers more, Yet they regarded neither signe, nor token. They madly did (vnto their owne confusion) The premisses confest, denie conclusion. 76 Good life likewise is needfull in a Preacher. Matth. 7.For, iust as by the fruit, the tree is knowne, So, wicked life not onely shames the Teacher, But makes the seed to wither, as 'tis sowne. The good tree seldome failes to beare good fruit, So life and doctrine must together suit. 77 Moses that man of God, a type of Christ, By whom the Law was giuen to the Iewe: In doctrines and in deedes came to him nigh'st, The one were holy, and the other true. He was a man, and had his imperfection, Some times he faulted, wanting Gods direction. 78 But he that was both God and Man together, His life and doctrine each approu'd the other: He erred not, nor faulted once in either, He liued euer spotlesse from his Mother. His foes that neer'st into his life did prie, One blemish in his actions could not spie. 79 Some hole they sought to finde out in his coat, Laid wait (at least) to catch him in his talke, Matth. 22. 15. They would haue seen in's eye the smallest moat: He so vprightly did both speake, and walke, As what they plotted for his hurt and shame, Vers. 22. Redounded more to glorifie his Name. 80 From sland'rous tongues he stood not wholly free, Matth. 11. 18. (His Harbinger and he were in one case) Sith he sometimes frequented companie, At feasts and friendly meetings had a place: They say he eates and drinketh more then measure, Among such men as liu'd in sinfull pleasure. 81 If he whose life was meere integritie, A paterne of perfection to all others: In whom was neither guile, nor flatterie, Did good to all, as they had beene his brothers: Despiced riches, honors, worldly pleasure, Sought after no thing else but heauenly treasure. 82 If he could not escape enuenom'd tongues, Nor finde protection in his innocence: But was content to beare, and put vp wrongs, And take his patience for his best defence: Then let all those who glorie in his Name, Learne what he did, and striue to doe the same. 83 That Harbinger of his, in life austere, Whose foode and diet were both meane and slender: A shamelesse false report of him they reare, (The conscience of back-biters is not tender.) That sure he was a wicked man, and euill, A Saint in shew, but inwardly a Deuill. 84 Prowd Pharisees, chiefe Rulers, captious Scribes, Were they that still oppugn'd, and wrong'd our Lord: The multitude, most part, of all the Tribes Gaue witnesse on his side, with one accord: Iob. 7. 48. &amp; 10 21. 41. Mar. 7. 37.Those damn'd his deeds, as if they came from hell: These truly said, he had done all things well. 85 Reuenge forbidden.For trespasses, for iniuries and wrongs, By Moses Law men might require amends: Luk. 18. 9. &amp; Rom. 13.(What right to God and Magistrates belongs, All that the Gospell charily defends.) Matth. 5. 38.Yet Christs sayes, Suffer wrong, and seeke no righting, Resist not, neither turne thy cheeke from smiting. 86 To loue our Enemies.The Scribes suppos'd, so they their knowne-friends lou'd, Of enemies there needed no respect. Our charitie by better markes is prou'd, On friends and foes alike, it must reflect. God makes his Sunne on good and bad to shine, His loue extends to all: and so must thine. 87 Luk. 10.The sample of that good Samaritan, Shewes vs the way in which we ought to goe: As he was kind vnto the wounded man, Whom he ne're saw before, nor did him knowe: So all that need our helpe, for Christ his sake, As our good friends and neighbours we must take. 88 Almes. Matth. 6. 1.Almes deeds are workes in which God takes delight, Rewards them franke, and freely of his grace: They must be closely done, as in his sight, Hee'll quit them openly, 'fore all mens face: But hypocrites that vainely seeke for prayse, Haue none at all with God, so Scripture sayes. 89 Hee sees the heart, and thoughts that lie most hidden, 1. Sam. 16. 7. Th' intent, eu'n as the act when it is done: If we conceaue a thing that is forbidden, 'Tis cleere to him, as is to vs the Sunne. Bee't much or little, let thy Almes be franke, Marc. 12. 41. 2. Cor. 9. 6. Done with a cheerfull heart, thou shalt haue thanke. 90 Who liues on earth, that needs not helpe from heauen? Prayer. Matth. 7. 7. Who, knowing he may haue it for the asking, Will not pursue the readie way, and eeuen, But gad about, as in darke night, a-masking? The way to haue our wants supply'de with store, Is zealous heartie prayer, and no more. 91 The wicked Iudge, whom that poore widow hanted, Seuerall parables expressing the efficacie of feruent prayer. Luk. 18. Though he of God, ne man had no regard: By importunitie her suit he granted. Sure, of the righteous Iudge we shall be heard, If daily to him we deuoutly crie, What e're we seeke that's fit, hee'll not denie. 92 What man, though closely couched in his bed, His doores fast shut, and he laid downe to rest: Would not rise vp to giue his friend some bread, If with long suit, and praying he be prest? Though law of friendship could not force him to it, Yet crying importunely makes him doe it. 93 Is any carnall father so vnkind, Whose sonne begs of him bread, or else a fish: That can conceaue such rancour in his mind, As lay a stone, or Serpent in his dish? If Mortalls on their sonnes, good gifts bestow, Much more will God, from whom all good doth flow. 94 Iam. 1. 6.“There's nothing of more force then feruent prayer, “Proceeding from the heart with true deuotion: “'Tis not the idle beating of the ayre, “Much lesse is't hypocriticall lip-motion. “On faith it must be grounded: feare and doubt “In prayer, euer makes vs goe without. 95 Iam. 5. 15. Eliah had (like vs) infirmities, Yet so much by his prayer he obtayn'd, As to command the Meteors, and Skies, That in three yeeres and halfe it neuer rayn'd. 11. King. 18.And when he pray'd on th' other side againe, Thick clowdes congealing, powred downe great raine. 96 In sacred Writ, examples there be store, Of Patriarkes, of Prophets, and of Kings, Of holy men and women many more, Whose prayers brought to passe most wondrous things. Iob. 14. 13.What need more? all that's asked in his Name, We haue a promise to receaue the same. 97 A Simile.What greater fauour can a subiect craue, Whose Sou'raigne of his bountie giues him leaue, Into his presence free accesse to haue, His iust requests assured to receaue? With God (by prayer) this is each mans case, To talke as with a friend, eu'n face to face. 98 In priuate prayer, secrecie doth best 'Twixt God and thee, thy closet doore made fast: The Pharisees fond praying was a jest, By mumbling in the streets where all men past. That Pharisaicall fashion, though worne-out, Some (yet) affect it as they walke about. 99 Church-seruices where Christians vse assembling, With vniforme consent of heart and voice To pray, and prayse their God: that's no dissembling, For of such seruice God himselfe makes choise. Matth. 18. 19. There many members, one whole body make, 'Tis one request wherein they all partake. 100 Much babling, vaine and idle repetitions, Was vs'd by Heathen people when they prayd: Sooner they hop't to speed in their Petitions, As if God knew no more, but what they sayd: Whereas ere we begin, he knowes our needes, And feruent faithfull prayer, euer speedes. 101 Th' Apostles (yet) not growne-vp to perfection, Luk. 11. 1. Finding how needfull thing it was to pray: Not trusting wholly to their owne election, Besought their Lord to set them in the way. It seemes he did their motion well allow, And instantly began to teach them how. 102 Hee needes not greatly on the matter pawse, Whose learning is not got by institution: Christ was not bound to humane rules and lawes, Who gaue perfection t'others by infusion: Gal. 1. 11. A perfect forme of prayer then he gaue them, With some instructions else, how to behaue them. 103 What sweeter comfort to a man that prayes, The Lords prayer. And first a preamble, of procm. Our father. Then that he makes his suit to his owne father? The father seldome childrens suites denayes, Hence full assurance euery man may gather, All that he iustly seeketh to obtaine: And not present his Orisons in vaine. 104 With reuerent respect and filiall feare, (Such as good children owe vnto their father) Men must prepare themselues ere they come neare, For that's the way to make them speed the rather. Not seruilely affraide, as slaues are wont, When sharpe correcting masters them confront. 105 Which art in heauen.When to an earthly Sire we make petition, Had he the will to grant what we require: He may perhaps be of such weake condition, As failes in pow'r, though not in his desire. This father's Lord of heauen, sea and land, These are (and all in them) at his command. 106 As he is pow'rfull, so hee's all as readie Psal. 50. 15. &amp; 145. 18. and Jer. 29. 11.To heare, and grant: his promise thereto tyes him. He in his promise euermore is steadie, Who this denyes blasphemously belyes him. Thus hauing will and might, how can it faile, But in our lawfull suites we must preuaile? 107 Sith he to whom our prayers we present, Aboue in th' heauens hath his habitation: Our cheifest scope therefore, and mayne intent, Must be when we preferre our Supplication, To ayme at heauenly obiects, and celestiall, Not fix our thoughts on things base, and terrestriall. 108 1. Petition. Hallowed b'ee thy Name.First we desire, Gods Name be sanctifi'de. By worship, and religious inuocation; That nothing but himselfe be Deifi'de, His Truth be spread abroad to euery Nation: His Name not vs'd in charmes, or coniuration. Nor in vaine oathes: all these cause profanation. 109 So men professing God, and his Religion, If they liue loosely in licenciousnesse, Make their profession fall into dirision, And scandalize that Faith which they professe: This is Vnhallowing of Gods holy Name, 2. Sam. 12 14. Rom. 2. 29. Breeds the Professors, and their Doctrine, shame. 110 As thou art Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, 2. Petition. Thy Kingdome come. So we entreat thee, let thy Kingdome come: As thou hast made, and gouernest all things, So those whom thou hast chosen, call them home. Enlarge thy Kingdome by thy pow'rfull Word, That Nations all, may knowledge thee their Lord. 111 Who so against thy Church lifts vp his hand, Who seekes to stop the passage of thy Word, Who doth thy Gospell impiously withstand, Cut them off with thy sharpe two-edged sword: That all the world may knowledge thee their King, Their Sonnes and Daughters to thy Temple bring. Es. 49. 18. 112 The Kingdome of the Dragon, and the Beast Beat downe, and bring them shortly to confusion: Let fowles of th' ayre be called to the feast, Reuel. 19. 17. Lord bring this battle to a short conclusion. Let Michael and his Angels ouer-come, That we may say (not pray) thy Kingdome's come. 113 The Sonne of God, though he were sinlesse man, 3. Petition. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen, Matth. 26. 39. Yet to his Fathers will subiects his owne: Then we which how'rly sinne, and nought else can, Should by our daily prayers make it knowne; That we desire his holy Will be done, And not our wills, which wilfull courses runne. 114 All that thou, in thy wisedome hast decreed, Which (vnreueal'd) is knowne to thee alone: Accomplish it (if't be thy Will) with speed, Let Men, and Angels, all agree in one: That likes as they aboue, so we belowe, May striue thy Will to doe, as well as knowe. 115 An idle cauill auoyded.These three requests to God himselfe pertaine, His glorie and his honour they concerne. Some may obiect, we pray for them in vaine, Sith of this lesson no man is to learne, Psal. 99.That what God will, shall be: that hee'll be King, Though all the Earth storme, and oppose the thing. 116 A Simile.Is not a father pleased with his sonne, For begging that, which he intends to giue him? Iob. 17.I reade that so 'twas by our Sauiour done, So here he teacheth, if we will beleeue him. 2 Sam 7. 25. 1. King. 8. 25.That God would keepe his promise, good men pray'd: Who of non-keeping it, were not affrayd. 117 4. Petition. Giue vs this day, our daily bread. Matth. 6. 25. note the place.Next for such things whereof we stand in need, This heau'nly Doctor teacheth vs to pray: He meanes by Bread (whereon we daily feed) Meat, drinke, and clothes the body to array. For as the bellies food we cannot lack: No more some needfull clothing to the back. 118 Gen. 3. 17. to 21.When Adam had his doome, and th' earth accurst, That fruitlesse Thornes, and Thrilles it should yeild: God for his needfull food takes order first, Commands him eate the herbes that grow in feild. Then brought him clothes, for him and for his wife, As things thought needfull, to sustayne their life. 119 Wee may not pray for superfluitie, Nor begge aboundance to maintayne excesse: But onely to supply necessitie, Our daily wants, we daily must expresse. To pray at some few times, for all the yeere, That's not the way, prescribed to vs heere. 120 No man, but needeth something euery day, The greatest Monarch reigning on the earth: This may enforce vs daily thus to pray, At least though we feele neither want nor dearth, We pray not barely for our selues alone, But for our fellow-members all in one. 121 Two things in briefe are learn'd by this Petition 5. Petition. Forgiue vs our debts, as wee forgiue our debtors. That all haue need for pardon to entreat: And sith the suit is made vpon condition, The sutor here by no meanes must forget, To plead condition really performed, Else out of Court his suit and he are turned. 122 This point more fully afterward is clear'd, In playner termes expressed for our learning: Gods sight may not with counterfeit be blear'd, And therefore is subioyn'd a gentle warning, That none shall haue of God his debts forgiuen, Till first with his owne debtors he make euen. 123 Aduize in what a desp'rate case he stands, Who begging pardon from a mightie King, A Simile, or Parable. For endlesse debts on forfeiture of bands: The King seekes nought in lieu, but one small thing, Which if not granted freely without faultring, He takes his whole debt, to the vtmost farthing. 124 6. Petition. Leade vs not into temptation.This last Petition more then all the rest, Requires our care to vnderstand it right: Temptations to distinguish first 'tis best, Thereby to giue this place the better light. For in that word there lyes a double sense, Which may distract our weake intelligence. 125 Iam. 1. 2.One parcell of the Text Canonicall, Beginneth with a speciall consolation, Exciting to reioyce when as we fall, Into a Christian triall, or temptation: A triall of true Faith, whence patience springs, Which all her workes vnto perfection brings 126 Such as be tempted thus, he calls them blest, If constancie accompanie their triall: The end of all their labours shall be rest, A crowne of lasting life without deniall. Reuel. 2. 10.Thus God hath promis't those that doe him loue, So they endure when gently he doth proue. 127 Such triall or temptation as this, Proceedes from God, and for his chosens good: 1. Cor. 4. 17. and 10. 13.To whom it breedes a great encrease of blisse, And so by constant Christians vnderstood. Heb. 11.This tempting is a token of Gods fauour, The faithfull euer found therein sweet sauour. 128 But men are tempted oft by in-bred lust, By fleshly motions pricking them to sinne: This tempting's not of God, for he is iust, And to such By-pathes neuer leades vs in. The Fiend obserues these sparkes of fire beginning, Then blowes the coles, and sets vs on to sinning. 129 When thus through humane frailtie we be tempted, Vnable of our selues to make resistance: By thy good grace (Lord) let vs be exempted, Then grant to vs thy holy Sprites assistance: Though strong temptations happen to distresse vs; Yet, of thy mercy, let them not oppresse vs. 130 Lord into this temptation leade vs not, Assist vs with thy ayde, and heau'nly grace: Within vs there's no powre, the smallest jot 2. Cor. 3. 5. To helpe our selues: Oh hide not thou thy face, Draw not thy mercy from vs in our need, Least Sinne and Satan in their purpose speed. 131 But free vs from all kind of sinne and euill, But deliuer vs from euill. Which hinders vs from cleauing vnto thee: Defend vs from our chiefest foe the Deuill, Who enuies most at mans felicitie: That rid from these, we may intend the rather, To serue and wait on thee our heau'nly Father. 132 We knowledge thee a King by lawfull right, The Epilogue. For thine is the Kingdome, the power and the glorie for euer. In pow'r and glorie all Kings farre transcending: For they be all as nothing in thy sight, Their Kingdomes faile, thine neuer shall haue ending. Thus end our prayers, with thy prayse: and then, To shew our hearts consent, we say Amen. Amen. 133 Here's that briefe-worded, richly furnisht prayer, All heau'nly and diuine: (as is the Maker) Well doth the Church obserue this custome fayre, (Though some vntoward sonnes therein forsake her) To begge all boones of God in Iesus Name, And shut vp all our prayers with this same. 134 Fasting.The perfect forme of prayer fully ended, Fit rules for Christian fasting he prescribes: Displayes abuses first to be amended. Hypocrisie, with Pharisees and Scribes A common fault, he warneth his to shunne, Then in few wordes sets downe what's to be done. 135 Scribes and PhariseesThose Hypocrites, men-pleasers, fasting oft, Deuiz'd how they might make it so appeare: The onely thing which by their fasts they sought, Was prayse of men. (Their guerdon they had here.) Luk. 18. 12.So fasted that prowd Pharisaike man, Who lifts himselfe aboue the Publican. 136 Matth. 6. 1. 5.He teacheth vs to fast, and not be seene, (As he had done in prayer, and almes-deed.) Anoint thy head, thy countenance keepe cleane, That in thy face, thy fasting be not read: Then God which sees thy workes in secrecy, Will of his grace reward thee openly. 137 Here fast and pray are fitly knit together, This simply in it selfe of greatest worth: That secondarily, as tending hither; For, zeale to pray, by fasting is set forth. “The soule then talkes to God at greatest pleasure, “When as the bodie's fed in sparing measure. 138 Some kinde of fasts not commendable.Yet all mens fasts are not to be commended. Some pinch their panch, thereby to spare their purse: These Euclioes are to be reprehended. Some fast, to eate the faster: those are worse. They'll fast a day or two before a feast, Then eate as much as two or three at least. 139 All times likewise for fasting are not fit. (Though praying no day falleth out of season.) The day wherein ones marriage bands be knit, Matth. 9. 14. May free that man from fasting, with good reason. To fast that day, were peeuishnesse, and folly, A trick to proue one sullen, more then holy. 140 “Fasts fitly walke with crosses, and affliction. “When Church or Common-weale are in distresse. “The Prince, or Pastors lay an interdiction “From sustenance, not barely from excesse: “And to this Act is ioyn'd the proper end, “That all to pray, the better may intend. 141 If one would cite Examples in this kind, The sacred Bookes abound with so great store: That entring in, 'twere hard an end to find, The Church obserues it now, and heretofore, Though not so rightly as was done at first: Compare all times, the latest still grow worst. 142 To fast, and yet runne on in doing ill, Ecclus. 34. 26. This fasting profits not the man that prayeth: But workes of mercy who so doth fulfill, Zech. 7. 9. Nor from the perfect rule of Iustice strayeth, The widow, poore and fatherlesse defends; Such fast, his prayers vp to heauen sends. 143 Of sundrie fasts the Scripture maketh mention, All commonly accompanyed with prayer: Watching. Vigilate &amp; Orate. watching and fasting, are in themselues indifferent. So Watching serueth for the same intention, Both, in themselues, things meere indiff'rent are. Fasts, watchings, praying ioyned with deuotion, Make way to heauen with a nimble motion. 144 To fastings, some exceptions haue beene taken: The like of watchings may be verifi'de. By watchfull theeues a purse oft-times is taken, And many other mischieues done beside. Pro. 23. 29. and 7.The letchers, and wine-bibbers watch whole nights, With more excesse to follow vaine delights. 145 Then Watching (simply) is no pious deed. The watchings which our Lord so oft commends, Matth. 24. 42. and 25. 1. and Luk. 31. 34.In liuely samples left for vs to read, They serue, and were laid downe to better ends: To rowze vs from our grosse securitie, And cause vs on his comming cast our eye. 146 His comming will be sodaine like a thiefe, In dead of night, when men doe least suspect. This apprehended with a firme beliefe, We would no oportunitie neglect, For feare he come vnwares, and find vs sleeping, Then cast vs to the pit of endlesse weeping. 147 So were those foolish Virgins taken napping, Vnfurnisht when the Bridegroome entred in: The gate once shut, in vaine they fell to rapping, When 'twas too late, then they to crie begin. For lack of watching well, they were excluded, And euer after, all their hopes deluded. 148 Riches perillous to their possessors.Among much riches, many snares are found. First, those that doe possesse them by discent, In pride, excesse, and riot oft abound, Then lauishly too frequently they're spent. And such as first acquire them (for most part) Vse violence, or some deceitfull art. 149 The wicked Steward, poore (it seemes) by birth, The parable of the vniust Steward. Luk. 16. Liu'd brauely on the substance of his Master, His time he spent in jollitie and mirth: Found-out at last to be a lauish waster, His subtle wit suggest to him a shift, To helpe at need: though 'twere a knauish drift. 150 The great rich Glutton wallowing in his wealth, The parable of the rich Glutton. Costly array, and in his sumptuous fare: He came not to them (that I read) by stealth, Yet as he tooke them, they became a snare, To traine his soule and body into Hell, Because he had no care to vse them well. 151 'Twas not enough for him to fill his belly With food for health, his hunger to expell: But dainties must be had, as pamp'ring gelly, And powring in, till he begun to swell. Wines of all sorts, full Bolls of sugred Sacco. (Yet durst I sweare he neuer dranke Tabacco, If all this within the parenthesis seem vnfit to any man; he may grant so much to poetike libertie: yet leaue it out if he list, the sense not interrupted. 152 That smoake at those times was not in request, But for this doting age reseru'd in store: Now 'tis an after-course at euery feast, To some it may doe good, but hurt to more Some fellowship is in't: for few or none, Without a fellow drinke of it alone. 153 The Glutton wanted that good propertie, Which might haue made his other faults the lesse But hee had rather see the poore man die, Then feed him with the scraps of his excesse. They be no niggards of their costly smoake, It flies so thick, that some are readie choake.) 154 Worldly cares prohibited: by similitudes, or comparisons.To hoard-vp treasures in a Boothe, or Tent, And in a desart, where's no long abiding: Where th' house by Theeues may easily be rent, The owner shortly must be there-hence riding: Bewrayes him for a mad man, or a foole, In Bedlam well he may be put to schoole. 155 To hide much stuffe, or furniture, or cloth; Lay Brasse, or Tin, or Iron in the dust: Where those will soone be eaten vp with moth, These halfe consum'd with canker, and with rust: Seemes not the part of him that's well aduiz'd, But of such one, whom folly hath surpriz'd. 156 Luk. 12. 13.Remember him whose grounds brought such encrease, His houses would not serue to hold his store: Then to his soule he vainly promis't peace, And built his Barnes farre bigger then before: But in that very right grim Death arrests him, Of goods, and lands, and life at once deuests him. 157 Many such be that hunt for worldly wealth, Make it the chiefest comfort of their life: Which shortly they must leaue, or lose by stealth, By toyling gotten, kept with stirre and strife. True treasure, worth the getting, they despise: Some mist of darknesse surely dims their eyes. 158 “The Store-house of true treasures all indeed, “Is that where blessed Angels keepe the keyes: “Where th' owner shall be sure to serue his need, “Where safely 'tis laid vp out of theeues wayes: Luk. 12. 34.“Our treasure lying there, our heart will thither? “For that, and this, goe commonly together. 159 Make choise, you worldly men, which likes you best, Of Masters twaine, to serue or t'one, or t'other: You must resolue, and thereon set your rest, To leaue the one, and cleaue vnto the other: For God with Mammon will not take a part, He will haue all, or no peece of your heart. 160 Meat, drinke, and clothes for which we daily pray By name of Bread (as formerly is told) Acquire, yet not with too much carke we may; On Prouidence we chiefly must lay hold. For he that giues vs life, will giue vs meate, And clothes to keepe our corps from cold, and heate. 161 The birds sowe not, nor reape, nor keepe in store, An Argument from birds, and flowers. Yet God prouides them food to serue their turnes: If so for them, for you hee'll doe much more. The grasse, which quickly in the Ouen burnes, Is cloth'd so gaily while in field it growes, That Solomon in state no brauer showes. 162 And why should men, whom God for sonnes doth take, Misdoubt the goodnesse of so kind a father? Why should they feare least he will them forsake, And not rest full assured of his fauour: Sith herbs, and birds he in their kinds preserueth, Both which to vs for vse, and pleasure serueth? 163 The way to heauen first we must seeke out, Querite primum regnum Dei. Desire and loue the things conducing thither: For earthly things then need we make no doubt, They shall be heaped on vs all together. But Heathens onely scrape for things below, Celestials they haue no lust to know. 164 O heau'nly Preacher! Sermon most diuine! Like Sermon neuer preached was before: Luk. 10. 23.Blest were your eares, and blessed were your eyne, That heard and saw these things, and many more. Great Kings and Prophets wisht to see, and heare them, Yet onely by faiths eyes, could they come neere them. 165 Looke backe at Stan. 38The blessings on Mount Gerizim all ended, From Ebal woes and curses are denounced, Against some men that would not be amended With wondrous works, nor heauenly words pronounced Eight wofull Woes he threatneth them withall, Sinnes crying for them, on their heads to fall. 166 1. Woe. Matth. 23. Woe to you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: Most wilfully yee shut the gate of heauen, Your selues will not come in, when Christ inuites: And (like mad men, of reason cleane bereauen, To fill vp full the measure of your sinne) You hinder others that would enter in. 167 Act. 4. 18. and 5. 40. Luk. 5. 43.Here's Stubbornnesse and Malice met together, Two damned sinnes, too common 'mongst that crue: So not with Christ, they runne they care not whither, The prouerb in these men was proued true: A dogge i'th' manger, though hee'll eate no hay, The Oxe that would, by snarling driues away. 168 2. Woe. Woe to you rau'nous greedie Cormorants, The Widdowes houses closely yee deuoure: Among such simple folke yee haue your hants, Feed on the sat, and eate the finest flowre: Pretending prayers for their soules saluation, The greater therefore shall be your damnation. 169 Woe to you Scribes that compasse Sea and Land, 3. Woe. Description of a Iewish proselite. To win a Heathen man from Gentilisme: And hauing brought him readie to your hand, Instructed newly in your Iudaisme; You make him wiser then he was before, As wicked as your selues, and twofold more. 170 Some rags he keepes of old Idolatries, Wherein by heath'nish teachers he was trayn'd: These, patching with your Iewish ceremonies, A sweet religion (doubtlesse) he hath gayn'd. With one sure knot, him to your selues yee tie, To crosse and hinder Christianitie. 171 Here's the description of a Proselite, The new disciple of those boasting Iewes: A worke of theirs proceeding most of spite, Christs Doctrine to oppose, his Name abuse. Woe to such damned Doctors, and their Schollers, With all that in like practise are their followers, 172 Woe to you Scribes, yee foolish guides, and blind, 4. Woe. Who teach a superstitious kind of swearing: Instilling vaine precepts into the mind, Which rightly pondred, are not worth the hearing. You would be thought deepe Doctors of the Law, Whereas your Doctrine is not worth a straw. 173 A man (say you) that by the Temple sweares, Or by the Altar: 'tis no sinne at all: If by the Gold, or Gift: his sinne he beares. A doctrine fond, and hypocriticall. The Temple (fooles) its gold doth sanctifie, So doth the Altar, gifts that on it lie. 174 The Temple then, is greater then its gold; The Altar, better then the gift thereon: Who sweares by either of them both (be bold) He sweares by all therein, and thereupon. As he that sweares by Heauen, Gods high Throne, By him sweares also, not by it alone. 175 5. Woe. Woe to you Scribes, full of hypocrisie; (Which in this one point, grossely doth appeare) You striue for things that of small moment bee, As tithing Cummin, Mint, and such like geare: For matters of great weight, you take no thought, If to your profit they auaile not ought. 176 You labour not in iudgement to doe right, You pitie not the poore in his distresse, Faith is not much esteemed in your sight: You should haue ioyn'd these greater, with those lesse. But hypocrites in trifles place deuotion, For breach of those they stirre vp foule commotion. 177 6. Woe.What greater marke of grosse hypocrisie, Then washing out-sides of the cups, and platters, Though fill'd within with cates for luxurie; Drinkes for excesse, and such like filthy matters? Blind Pharisee, first make the in-side cleane, The out-side after that clense thou againe. 178 Pharisaicall traditions. Mar. 7.These hypocrites, all bent on superstitions, With Scripture-learning not well satisfi'de, Ioyne thereunto an heape of their traditions, To walke by Moses, and the Prophets side: That helpes to further vertue they might seeme, And taken so, be held in more esteeme. 179 As that Seducer strictly charg'd his sonnes, 1. King. 13. (Seeming to doe the man of God a fauour) In one selfe-tombe by him to lay his bones, And made a shew of other kind behau'our: It was (in truth) to doe himselfe a grace, Ios. dè Antiq. Iud. lib. 8. cap. 8. As one great Scholler notes vpon this place. 180 Iust so in following ages it fell out. When other graues were ript-vp, and defac't, 2. King. 23. 15. The bones on that base Altar burnt about: That tombe wherein the man of God was plac't, Remayn'd vntoucht: the bones in it, were spar'd: Therein the bad man, with the good one shar'd. 181 The Pharisees, our Lords Disciples blame, Traditions of the Elders not respecting: Not washing hands when to their meales they came, And some like obseruations else neglecting. But he reproues such holy-seeming rites, And to Gods seruice seekes their hearts, and sprites. 182 These outward things doe not a man defile, What enters by the mouth, and serues for meate, It stayes within the belly but awhile: Ill thoughts that hold within the heart their seate, From whence proceed theft, murthers, blasphemies, These stayne men both in soules, and in their bodies. 183 Woe to all such as righteous seeme in showe, 7. Woe. Like Tombes set forth in honour of the dead: Bedeckt with gilded Puppets on a rowe, With wreathes and crowners to adorne the head, When all within is filth, and rotton bones. False hypocrites, all of you are such ones. 184 8. Woe. Woe to you, for your close dissimulation, Your false pretence of zeale, and pietie: Your shadow of religious veneration To Prophets, and their blessed memorie, By building of their tombes, and monuments, And trimming them with curious ornaments. 185 For murth'ring them, your fathers you betwit; These you condemne, your selues you iustifie: You say, you would not haue partak't in it. Yes sure, you passe them in impietie. You brood of Vipers, thinke vpon it well: How meane you to escape the pit of hell? 186 As did your fathers, so and worse, will yee. I'll send you Prophets for your admonition: You'll scourge and kill them, 'cause they come from mee: That all the righteous bloud (by iust permission) Which from the first, vnto the last is shead, May all together light vpon your head. 187 Ierusalem, that Citie so renown'd, The Glorie (once) of all the world beside: Shall shortly be laid euen with the ground, All ruinated for her childrens pride: For killing Prophets, stoning of the iust, Shee shall lye waste, and scatt'red in the dust. 188 Her children vnder couer of my wing, As Henns doe Chicken, so should I haue hid: Yet they would not, but prowdly scorn'd the thing, At length they will repent for what they did. The time shall come (though long) when they will say, (Turn'd once to me) Blest be that happy day. 189 A happy day, and ioyfull to behold, To all that loue the comming of our Lord: When both the flocks shall fall into one fold, Iob. 10. Es. 40. 11. and 27. 12. As sacred Writers often doe record. When that Great Shepherd, owner of the sheepe, From Woolues and Hirelings safely shall them keepe. 190 'Tis time this Shepherd set his helping hand, To seeke such wandring sheepe as goe astray: To rule and shield them with his shepherds wand, Psal. 23. 4. (For now to rau'nous beasts they be a prey.) To cure some griefes where with they're so opprest, That 'mong themselues they cannot liue in rest. 191 Aboue all beasts, and euery brutish creature, A short digression of the nature of sheepe: seruing for instruction. The Sheepe for sundrie reasons I commend: Most harmelesse, and most gentle is his nature, The pasture where he feedes, he most doth mend: He yeilds vs food, and clothes for back, and bed, Great profit we haue by him liue, and dead. 192 A simple beast, none else he doth offend, Not Fox-like craftie, others to deceaue, Himselfe he knowes not well how to defend: If to himselfe, the shepherd doe him leaue, He keepes no Bounds, but strayes on euery Hill, Where Woolfe or Curre that meets him, may him kill. 193 And albeit he be by kind a Ranger, Yet will he listen to his Keepers call: But not endure the whistle of a stranger, Regard his voyce, or follow him at all. Poore sheepe! let none accompt it for a shame, To be entitled by so good a name. 194 Then with deepe iudgement doth the holy Writ, Compare Gods people to a flock of sheepe: Th' Analogie betwixt them is so fit, A man that is not drowsie, or a sleepe, May reade and aptly make an application, Without a glosse to helpe th' interpretation. 195 An obseruation touching the biting of mad sheepe. Note.It's strange in this most gentle natur'd beast, If one of them doe happen to fall mad, (As oft it doth) that runnes, and bites the rest, No cure for such their biting can be had. There's helpe for dogs that bite, when they be wood: For mad sheepes biting, I know nothing good. 196 Some madnesse lately Christ his sheepe hath seaz'd, Th' one hunts and bites the other in such rage, Their furie by no meanes can be appeaz'd, The Pastors faile their furie to asswage. A heauie case: when Woolues are cloy'd with biting, To see one sheepe, against another fighting. 197 A prayer to the great Shepherd. Great Shepherd, 'tis thy flock which thou hast bought, With things of higher price then purest gold: Forsake them not, nor sell thou them for nought, But fetch them home, and bring them to thy fold: Ordayne some curing salue, or wholsome drench, The fell infection of their bloud to stanch. 198 This wooluish humour out of them expell, In such whose nature is not wholly tainted; That sheepe, like sheepe in meeknesse may excell, And be no more with rau'nous beasts acquainted: That all which to thy Fold doe appertaine, May come to thee, and make one flock of twaine. 199 Some sheepe thou hast, yet of another leare, The Iewes. That long haue strayd, and will come home in fine: They haue beene often call'd, but would not heare, Thou onely knowest which of them be thine. Me thinkes I see one lett of their conuersion, Yet on no Man, or State I cast aspersion. 200 De facto, or De jure I may erre, An obseruation touching the Iewes and their slowe conuersion. Faine would I learne, take sober satisfaction. Somewhere I read, and some I heare auerre, As if by rigour, and extreame coaction, They were kept back from Christianitie, If so, the greater is their miserie. 201 Into the Church they cannot get admission, Nor haue lauacre in the sacred Font, But onely vpon this extreame condition, Their wealth, and liuelihood must lye vpon't: Their goods all to a groat, they must forsake What others please to giue, that onely take. 202 The case seemes hard. (I thinke 'tis theirs aright.) Though all (compar'd to Christ) should be neglected, Life, lands, and goods we must esteeme but light, If keeping them, our faith must be reiected. But here (for my part) I see no such cause, If 'twere not for the rigour of the Lawes. 203 A woe was laid vpon their predecessors, (The first of eight, whereon I late insisted) Sian. 165. For hind'ring some that would haue beene possessors Of heau'n; but that their entrance they resisted. Their children now find some such opposition, That stops into the Church their free admission. 204 In this my speech, I would not be mistaken, The case (I know) a diff'rence doth admit. The Scribes would haue Christs way to be forsaken, And hindred men from entring into it. All are inuited now into the way: Yet tell me, why they should so dearely pay? 205 The Gentiles are not fully yet come in, Rom. 11.Vntill that time, their Calling is deferr'd: They'll come apace, when once they doe begin, And loue the Truth at length, that long haue err'd. All signes but that, are come to passe (some say) Which before-runners of the latter day. 206 More lessons yet recorded doe I find, Which our great Doctor to his Schollers taught. Rash iudgement forbidden. Matth. 7.Rash iudgement is a weaknesse of the mind, The practice of it, altogether naught. “Prie not into the faults of other men, “Least others doe the like to thee agen. 207 “A beame (most times) abideth in his owne, “That soonest spies a moat in's neighbours eye: “The faults behind the back, are hardly knowne, “In that end of the Wallet ours doelye. Each man first mend himselfe ere he beginne, To check another rashly for his sinne. 208 Holy things not to begiuen to dogs.Things that be holy, giue not vnto Dogs, To men prophane, that be of currish kind: Nor cast your rich pearles vnto filthy Hogs, To men in shape, but of a beastly mind. You get no thankes of them, nor will they mend: But scorne your Lore, and raile at you in th' end. 209 Two wayes there be, wherein men vse to walke, The narrow gate, and the broad way. Two places whereunto those wayes doe leade: The one is narrow, rough, and hard to stalke, The other broad, faire, smooth, and soft to treade. Facilis discensus auerni. Few walke in that, yet tends it vnto blisse: The later leades to hell, most run in this. 210 Good fellowes haue a by-word in their lips, Goe where yee will, to Heauen or to Hell, The more, the merrier. Still companie is good. The Deuill skips At such fine jests: the saying likes him well. I rather hold, as I haue learned heere, The fewer the better cheere. Where fewest be, there is the better cheere. 211 He warneth vs, false prophets to beware, Beware of false prophets. A sort of men not lightly to be knowne: Some notes he giues to finde out who they are, They take a shape vpon them, not their owne. By outward shew, you thinke them to be sheepe, Their wooluish nature inwardly they keepe. 212 As fruit declares the vertue of the tree, Whereby men iudge it either good, or bad: So by their workes, these men proue what they bee, A better proofe then that, cannot be had. Their fruits are wicked doctrines, vices store, Of teachers such as these, were neuer more. 213 Like one that builds his house vpon the sand, A parable of the house built vpon the sand. When raine, and stormes, and tempests on it beat; Foundation being weake, it cannot stand, But downe it falls, the fall thereof is great: So's he that heares the Word, and thereof talketh, Yet as the same commands him, neuer walketh. 214 The house vpon the rock.But he that heares, learnes, and thereafter liues, Is like a man that builds vpon a Rock: Let stormes and tempests rage, it neuer giues, But still vnmou'd abides the hardest shock. Wise builders thus, from foolish we discerne: And doers, from those that doe nought but learne. 215 Sundrie parables. First of the Sower, and the Seed. Matth. 13.Of hearers, sundrie diff'rent sorts there bee: Some onely take the sound in at the eare, The heart doth neuer thereunto agree, The Deuill takes the seed that's sowen there. Seed by the wayes side.And this is it which on the wayes side fell: To heare nothing at all, would doe as well. 216 Seed in stonie ground.Some (little better) heare and vnderstand, And cheerfully true doctrine doe embrace: But lacking root, when troubles are at hand, They fall away, and dare not shew their face. “Prosperitie gets friends (such as they bee) “True friendship's tri'de best in aduersitie. 217 Seed among Thornes.In some (and sure that number is not small) The care of wealth, and other worldly things, So choakes the fruit, it thriueth not at all, The Thornes together with the Seede vp-springs: By all these meanes, much seed is shed in vaine, The Sower loseth labour, and his graine. 218 Seed in good ground.Good seed, when in good ground it haps to fall, To th' husband-man yeilds wonderfull encrease: It thriues apace, yet not alike with all, Those thirtie, sixtie those, an hundred these For one doe make returne, as God doth blesse, Ones glorie shall be great, one others lesse. 219 A fruitfull field, when seed therein is cast, The parable of the Tares. The ground and graine both, being good and pure: How is it that it doth not alwayes last, And perfect in its prime estate endure? The reason of this change, faine would I learne, For how it comes, I cannot yet discerne. 202 Whilst Doctors of the Church securely sleepe, The Deuill sowes his Tares among the Wheat: Good watch therefore the Pastors ought to keepe, For if these weedes, once root and moring get, They'll not be weeded cleanly from the graine, But 'mong it till the haruest must remaine. 221 Such is the meaning of that fishing Net, Of the net cast into the sea. Wherein were catched fish of euery kind: The fisher-men all vp on shore doe get, Not leauing any, good nor bad behind. The best then into vessells doe they lay, The bad they set aside, and cast away. 222 The Church (which is Gods Kingdome here on earth, Of the mustard seed. Whereof great things in holy Writ are told) As is a mustard seed, small in her birth, So shee: yet growing vp, and waxing old, 'Tis strange to see her wonderfull encrease, In greatnesse, glorie, riches, state and peace. 223 By three short pithy parables beside, Three other short parables, all tending to one end. The vertue, worth, and value of his Word He represents: it cannot be deny'de, But each of them instruction doth afford. For, things whose vse and worth be knowne aright, Are more esteem'd, and held with more delight. 224 Of the leauen.Good leauen worketh in a heape of meale, And makes it sau'rie bread to strength the heart: So sound and sau'rie doctrine taught with zeale, Soule-feeding viands doth to man impart. Matth. 16. 6.But Pharisaicall leauen is so ill, A little of it, all the lump doth spill. 225 Of the hid treasure, and the pearle.As treasure closely hid within the ground, Or Orient pearles of price inestimable: When once a thriftie Merchant hath them found, And knowes them to be things vnvaluable: Sells all he hath eu'n to the vtmost mite, And in those iewels gets himselfe a right. 226 The Word of God.The value of this pearle vnvaluable, Was neuer better knowne then in these dayes: Neuer so much proclaym'd incomparable, Neuer in any age found greater prayse. Yet presse vs with our wordly wealth to buy it, Wee'll rather keepe those trifles, and denie it. 227 Matth. 19. 20.Like that young man who vaunts himselfe too boldly, That all the Law he carefully had kept: Toucht in his goods, tooke that receipt so coldly, As hanging downe his head, aside he stept. See, too much loue of riches is a let, That th' Owners vp to heauen hardly get. 228 Our trading is not (chiefly) for that coast, Where this rich pearle, and treasure's to be got: Some feare with windes, and tempests to be tost, Some find the way too cold, and some too hot. Best things indeed are hard'st to be obtayn'd, Toyes little worth with lesse adoe are gayn'd. 229 When all these heau'nly Doctrines he had ended, He turn'd him home to preach among his kinred, But these men at his person were offended: Matth. 13. 54. (Though hearing him; they stood amaz'd, and wondred) They twit him with his parentage, and breeding, And muz'd from whence his learning had proceeding. 230 Such was their wilfull incredulitie, He had no long abiding in that place: They scorn'd him for his great humilitie, Requit his loue and labour with disgrace. The old saw touching Prophets, held in him, No Prophet esteemed in his owne Countrey. The neerer home, the further from esteem. 231 The fleshly sonnes of blessed Abraham, Though therein they had some preheminence: Rom 3. 1. Rom. 9. Yet were not they made blessed by the same, No more were Christ his kin, who tooke offence At him, and at his Doctrine most diuine, Whereat through vnbeliefe they did repine. 232 When he began his miracles and teaching, And chose the twelue, whom he Apostles nam'd, Who after might succeed him by their preaching His kinsmen hearing it, were not asham'd Mar. 3. 21. To wish him bound, as if he had beene mad, When with his presence all men else were glad. 233 Men linkt to him in sp'rituall alliance, Apostles and Disciples, with some other Who heard him gladly, put in him affiance, Those he esteem'd his brethren, and his mother. Matth. 13. 40. What comfort to all Christians should this bee, To hold with Christ so neere affinitie? 234 Humilitie commended. Matth. 18. and 20. 20.Though his Disciples long had heard him preaching, And might by him haue learn'd humilitie: It seemes yet they had need of further teaching To keepe them from ambitious primacie. They aske him, who in heau'n shall be the great'st? He wills them suit themselues vnto the least. 235 Then for example sets a little child Amid them all, and bids them looke on him: As he is, so be you meeke, humble, mild, By these three steps to heauen must you clim. This is the readie way to bring you thither, And straying hence, you walke you know not whither. 236 The parable of labourers in the Vineyard, elegantly setting on seuerral Christian Doctrines. Iob 11. 20. and 1 Cor. 10, 12.To Princes, and the ciuill Magistrate, Gods deputies; dominion doth pertaine: You may not their example imitate, Your office is to teach, and not to reigne. The great'st 'mong you, let him be as the least: And he that's chiefe, doe seruice to the rest. 237 You call me Master, therein yee say true, I am content to wash and wipe your feet. Doe each to other, as I did to you, By my example that you learne, it's meet. The seruant who takes scorne his Lord to follow, His heart vnto his Master is but hollow. 238 To come to God, 'tis best begin by time, Each man when he is called, must attend: Yet not presume himselfe to be the prime, Or that the Lord, his wages ought to mend. Nor enuie others of a later calling, But looke well to himselfe, for feare of falling. 239 That labourer which worketh but one howre, Call'd to the Vineyard when the daye's neere spent: His hire may hap to be as good, and more Then some, which thither in the morning went. The first, be last: the last, somewhiles be first: And of such as be call'd, some may be curst. 240 And other Scripture fully proues the same. The parable of the mariage of the Kings sonne. Matth. 22. The storie of that royall marriage feast, Where euery sort of people called, came: One was excluded like a sawcie ghest. A maxim laid, that 'mong men call'd, of those The Lord some few, as pleaseth him, doth chose. 241 Some being called to this sumptuous feast, The parable of the great supper. Luk. 14. Come not at all, though louingly requested: The number of such men is not the least, They haue excuses formally digested. Their worldly bus'nesse pleades excuse for some, But wiued men say flat, they cannot come. 242 The Isra'lites with Manna long were fed, Conclusion of this fift Classis, with that most heauenly doctrine of our Sauiour. Iob cap. 6. Whereof their children afterwards did boast They laboured for body-filling bread, (And so 'tis now the practise of the most) They had the shadow: Christ at length doth bring That which by it was meant, the very thing. 243 Here's the true bread of life that came from heauen, The man that eates thereof, shall neuer die: Here must be ioyn'd no mixture of old Leauen, 1. Cor. 5. 8. The fruits of malice, and impietie. Who comes to him and in him doth beleeue, Nor thirst, nor hunger euer shall him grieue. 244 What kind of food is this, that euer lasteth? Gen. 3. 1. King. 17.A Tree of life like that in Paradise? As th' widowes oile and meale that neuer wasteth? No meate like it, nor of so high a price. Iob. 6. 34.The Iewes desired of our Lord that food, Ere they the nature of it vnderstood. 245 Job. 4. 15.Their sense was like the Womans at the Well, Grosse Capernaites, thought on their belly-cheare For when they fail'd of that, away they fell, Of sp'rituall eating, had no lust to heare. Because they ate the loaues, and had their fill, Chap. 6. 26.They followed, looking for such feeding still. 246 Why carke yee for the meat that soone doth perish, That serues the turne but whil'st it is in chewing? Seeke that, which had the hungrie soule doth cherish, The eater with spirituall grace endewing. This is the food (saith he) which I will giue To euery one that doth on me belieue. 247 My Flesh and Bloud are meat and drinke indeed, Who eateth not thereof, must die for euer. But he that faithfully thereon doth feed, Dwells so in me, that no thing shall vs seuer. I dwell likewise in him, and as I liue, So life eternall to him will I giue. 248 Here's a true feast, not parabolicall, Deuiz'd to shadow out another thing: A feast indeed super-celestiall, Made for all commers by an heauenly King. Aug. Crede, &amp; manducasti. Vers. 35. 47.Beleeue and thou hast eaten, saith one Father: From Christs owne wordes, that sentence he might gather. 249 Come all that vnder heauie burthens groane, Matth. 11. 28. The weight whereof you are not able beare: I'll take them from your shoulders on my owne, Come rest your selues with me, and doe not feare. Beleeue, and liue: I came not to condemne Iob. 3. 14, 15, 16 But those, who offred grace prowdly contemne. 250 He had himselfe a speciall kind of meate, To worke and doe his heauenly Fathers will: Iob. 4. 34. So, by beleeuing truly, we doe eate, There is no feeding else, the soule to fill. To eate, beleeue, and come to him expresse Here, one selfe thing; and neither more, nor lesse. 251 The Sacrament was not yet instituted, No Sacramentall bread is mention'd here, The wordes of this place In the institution of the Sacrament. after be transmuted: Yet all which at that time beleeuers were, Did eate and feede on him to soules saluation, Vneating vnbeleeuers found damnation. 252 This Doctrine of all others most diuine, Th' Epitome of th' Euangelike writ: At preaching caused many to repine, To leaue their Lord, and take offence at it. Th' Apostles, by their mouth who for them spake, Confession of their faith more cleerly make. 253 They knowledge him that Christ, the Sonne alone Of God; the true God, and the euer-liuing: Dan. 15. 5, 6. Another Lord or Sauiour they knew none, From him they hope for helpe through their beleeuing: Forsaking Lords, and Masters all beside, Consent with him for euer to abide. 254 Here, gentle Muse, repose thy selfe awhile, A sweeter place of rest thou canst not find: Let thought of this, all other thoughts beguile, And make thee apter for the taske behind: That singing on a Theame so farre aboue thee, Good men for thy endeuour may approue thee. The end of the fift Classis. The sixt Classis. THE ARGVMENT. Th' Apostles warn'd, and arm'd 'gainst Persecution: Strange newes to them who saw Mount Tabors vision. The Cities, Temples, Worlds last dissolution, Sweet Comforts mixt oft, by our soules Phisition. The Passion, with all circumstances traced: Christs blessed Bodie in his Tombe left placed. 1 The meanes I haue obseru'd in euery storie, Which treats of famous Captaines, and their Acts; Whereby themselues attayn'd the height of glorie, Their Armies honouring them with due respects: Were not to all, nor at all times, the same, It askes more skill to play so hard a game. 2 Our Cheiftayne prest vnto this sp'rituall warre, (A conflict of much perill, and much paine) Meant not to gaze vpon the fight from farre, His men to 'bide the brunt, he take the gaine: But puts his person foremost at the breach. (The brauest way, young men at armes to teach!) By comparison with warlike Captaines, here is set forth the wisedome and valour of our great Generall in the spirituall warfare. 3 He failes not oft withall to vse perswasion, With wordes of grace, and reasons full of weight; So takes from coward mates all iust euasion, Commands them tread the narrow way, and streight: Propounds rewards to all that stoutly fight, Casts shame on such as yeild, or turne to flight. 4 When he enroll'd them first in's muster booke, With title of his Souldiers once endew'd: For heart'ning them, a skilfull course he tooke, 'Gainst all assaults that afterwards ensu'de. Their faith by signes and wonders he makes sure, Hard-after-trials better to endure. 5 Doubtlesse at first it seemed strange to them, To heare of persecutions and affliction, Whose eyes were fixt on faire Ierusalem, Where they expected temp'rall iurisdiction. Matth. 27. 42. Iob. 6. 15.The Priests and Elders dreamt of such a thing, That Christ must be a potent earthly King. 6 Esav 9. 7.What Prophets of his sp'rituall Kingdome spake, Expressing state, and great magnificence; A wrong construction thereof they did make, According to their grosse intelligence. Their children yet are blinded with that error, Of stubborne vnbeliefe a wondrous mirror. 7 So much they doted on this idle dreame 'Twas hard to draw them from that poore conceit: He therefore preacht vpon another Theame, Taught what great troubles they were to await: To looke for triall, combates, heauie crosses, No gaine of worldly treasure, but all losses. 8 A Simile.Vnlookt for 'larams, Souldiers most affright, Amaze and quickly put them to a rout: But chiefly if they happen in the night, When men lye sleeping void of feare and doubt. Great armies by these meanes are oft defeated, With stratagems (force failing) they be cheated. 9 Our Leader in his wisedome this foresawe, Instructs his Souldiers what they must expect: He bids them neither faint, nor stand in awe, Their troubles would produce a good effect: Such momentanie suffrings should procure, A crowne of glorie euer to endure. 10 Yet marke the time (for well 'tis worth the noting) When first this point of Doctrine he divulged: Matth. 16. 15. Not whil'st they hou'red in opinions floting, (By such a storme, as then, they might beene bulged.) But when in points of faith they were well grounded, Then doctrines of afflictions he propounded. 11 By questioning he sounded their beliefe, Demands them all, whom take you mee to bee? One answer'd for the rest (as being chiefe) Thou art that Christ, the sonne of God, saith hee. Their faith exprest by this diuine confession, Prou'd them good Christians in a faire progression. 12 They thus assur'd of his Diuinitie, Of pow're enough all foemen to subdue, And sith his loue to them they daily see; What danger could be doubted to ensue? Where will to doe them good, concurres with might; In confidence they may expect for right. 13 Now thought th' Apostles they stood most secure, In easie state, seruing so great a Master: But that perswasion did not long endure, For soone he told them of a strange disaster; A case that made the greatest of them shrinke, And on some cunning remedie to thinke. 14 The Apostles forewarned, and armed against persecutions.He shew'd them what great crosses he must suffer By Elders, Priests, and Rulers of the Iewes: What iniuries and wrongs they would him offer, His Person with indignities abuse: And lastly cause him die with bitter paine. But in three dayes (saith he) I'll rise againe. 15 Which latest wordes if they had noted well, Such speciall ioy and comfort did containe, As seru'd all care and sorrow to expell, And leaue them no occasion to complaine: Matth. 17. 9, 10. Luk. 18. 34But they (as then) perceau'd not what it meant, Their thoughts, and hearts another way were bent. 16 The man (it seemes) who lou'd his Master best, (His Lord as dearely louing him againe.) Was bold aside to take him from the rest, (Amazed much to thinke he should be slaine.) Perswades him not to yield vnto their will, Who bent themselues his guiltlesse bloud to spill. 17 Thus ran he side-long led by a wrong byas, Deceaued with a false imagination, Not knowing yet the office of Messias, But doting on an earthly domination: He hop't to see him in a royall Throne, A thing that all the Iewes rely'de vpon. 18 But Christ was borne vnto another end, To conquer Satan, Hell, and Death by dying: What Adam had deprau'd, that to amend, Not to resist, nor saue his life by flying. Matth. 16. 23.So checks his seruant for his misse-aduise, Who to the World, but not to God, was wise. 19 No, no, saith he to his Disciples all, If you will be my men, and follow mee: You must resolue to come when I doe call, To beare my crosse, much lesse from crosses flee. Who for my sake is bold his life to venter, Into a better life shall surely enter. 20 There is a death of deaths, that dyeth neuer; The thought whereof makes wicked men agast. This is a life of liues that lasteth euer, The life we leade here, is to it a blast. Some of you die not, till thereof you tast, And find the full fruition of't at last. 21 To gaine the world, with all the wealth therein, And lose this blessed life whereof I tell: What case, I pray, were such a winner in, That for exchange of Heauen, getteth Hell? That for some pelfe, and transitorie pleasure, Doth damne his soule, exceeding all earths treasure. 22 Here's a cooling card for men delitious, A bastinado to bumbast a coward: A counterbuffe for Christians ambitious, A spur to prick snaile-pasing souldiers forward. Schoole-boyes are led with gifts, or forc't with rods; A Simile. 'Twixt men and boyes (herein) there's little ods. 23 Physicians next to pills, and bitter potions, Another Simile, or Comparison. Giue comfortable broths, or pleasing drinke, Our Lord soone after those heart-griping motions, Which brought them neere the pit, eu'n to the brinke: To giue new heart, and to refresh their spright, Was pleas'd to let them see a glorious sight. 24 Such visions God at other times reueal'd To holy men, wherein they did behold High things, from others meet to be conceal'd. Exod. 33. 12.This may we reade in sacred writings old, So much of God as mans sight could abide, He from his seruant Moses did not hide. 25 That great Apostle, Gentiles Doctor Paul, (Though called last, and least in his owne sight) Who 'mongst his fellowes labour'd more then all, Act. 9. and 18. and 23. And 2. Cor. 12.Had seuerall visions passing cleare and bright. Once taken vp to heauen, he saw and heard, What to no mortall man might be declar'd. 26 Rare mysteries, and visions most diuine, Saint Iohn in the Reuelation.Saw that belou'd Disciple of our Lord: The host of heauen set before his eyne, The King himselfe, whom humbly all ador'd. So they who Christ transfigur'd here beheld, With ioyes of heauen for the time were fill'd. 27 The transfiguration of Christ. Matth. 17.Vp to Mount Tabor three of them he leades, To see and take a taste of heau'nly pleasure: A wondrous clowd the Mountaine ouer-spreades, His shining glorie they beheld at leasure. Two Saints appeare, that in them they might see, The blessed state of such as Sainted bee. 28 Then from that shining clowd they heare a voyce, Exod. 16. 10. &amp; 1 King. 8. 10. 2. Pet. 1. 16.(The Godhead, as of old, therein abiding.) The wordes were such as made them all reioyce, Though to the ground they fell, their faces hiding. The Father of his Sonne did witnesse beare, Commanding them precisely him to heare. 29 This vision for their faith and comfort showne, His Person and his Godhead cleerly proued: Yet charg'd he them in no wise to make knowne; Till he againe were risen from the dead. Loe of his death he once more here makes mention, To th' end they might obserue it with attention. 30 This doctrine could not sinke into their braine, Though oft it had beene beate into their eares: A question thereupon they moue againe, (Me thinkes I see them hang 'twixt hope and feares.) Why say the Scribes Elias must come first? Matth. 17. 10. Hee's come, and they to him haue done their worst. 31 And as they did to him, they'll doe to mee: His person they despis'd and set at naught, Though all his life were full of sanctitie, The doctrine sound and holy which he taught: That could not sheild him from their sl?derous tongues. Such recompence from them to me belongs. 32 These be those husband-men all void of grace, Matth. 21. 33. That to their Lord his lawfull fruits deni'de; That beate his men, left some dead on the place, That did him many spitefull wrongs beside; That kill'd his sonne, th' inheritance to get. On such a mischiefe, Iewish priests be set. 33 From these bloud-suckers what can you expect Arguments and exhortations to patience and suffring with Christ. Matth. 10. 25. When Mee your Master they will not forbeare: It's like to you they'll carry small respect, Yet haue you no great cause their force to feare: The Soule they cannot touch, nor doe it hurt; The bodie's but a clot of clay, or durt. 34 Before the ciuill Iudges they will cite you, As euill doers that transgresse their Lawes: Of capitall offences they'll endite you, And though you giue none, they will find a cause. Luke 21. 17.All men shall hate you for your loue to mee, Your neer'st in bloud, and consanguinitie. 35 The sonnes and fathers shall betray each others, All linkes and bonds of nature broken quite: Men shall not spare to persecute their brothers, Iohn 16. 1.Thinking thereby they doe to God his right. Church-rulers they will anathematize you, 1. Cor. 4.And as vild out-casts of the world despise you. 36 This is your state, this must be your condition, Peace with this world I am not come to make: They bend themselues to quarrels and sedition, Against the Truth; the Deuils part they take. 2. King. 9. 22.What peace with such should my Disciples hold, Who to all sinne and vice themselues haue sold? 37 Your life must be a warfare vnder mee, As well my foes with courage to withstand; As patiently to beare their tyrannie, When I permit you fall into their hand. A little triall will augment your glorie, These suffrings past, you shall no more be sorie. 38 Reward there's none to them which faint, or flie. All that with me in triumph will ascend, Must be resolu'd to ouercome or die, And perseuere my Souldiers to the end. Finis Coronat opus.The end is it that euery worke doth crowne, Halfe deeds deserue nor honour, nor renowne. 39 What man attempts the building of a Towre, Two apt Similies. Luke 14. 28. That doth not first account vpon the cost? Least hauing once begun, it passe his powre, So shame is gotten, and his labour lost. Then all beholders thus at him will flout, This man began, but could not bring't about. 40 Or who so foolish to begin a warre, (A businesse that doth great fore-sight require) But first whilst yet his foe remaines afarre, Consulteth of his force ere he draw nigher? And if he finde himselfe the weaker partie, By Embassies entreats a friendly parley. 41 Should any Captaine (bent to giue a charge,) A Comparison. With wordes and arguments of halfe this weight, Exhort and animate his men at large, To march with cheere and on their Leader wait: Were't not foule shame for Souldiers there to faint, Their memories with cowardize to taint? 42 This Captaine after seated in a Throne, His faithfull, hardie Souldiers well rewarded: Shares with the good, those bad-ones should get none, Not come within his Court, nor be rewarded. Who him forsakes, of him shall be forsaken: This Caueat may faint-hearted Christians waken. 43 Thus his belou'd Disciples he enformes, Their Masters office rightly t'vnderstand: Thus heartens them against all future stormes: As Nurses leade young Children by the hand, A Simile. Till they get strength, and wit to walke alone Yet fall they often, when the Nurse is gone. 44 Great need they had to be so well fore-warn'd, Sith hard encounters they were to sustaine: (A man that's warn'd, is said to be halfe arm'd, Sodaine surprisalls, strongest places gaine:) Their Lord abus'd; scourg'd, nayled to a Tree. What greater griefe then such a sight to see? 45 Themselues who building on their Masters powre, Fram'd Castles in the aire, dreamt of high things: Each of them hoping for some Princely towre, All making full accompt to raigne as Kings: 'Twas doubtfull when their hopes herein did faile them, Least sad dispaire, through sorrow, should assaile them. 46 A Simile.As often it befalls to worldly men, Who missing hop't-for honors, wealth and treasure; Most commonly not one of them 'mongst ten, Ioyes afterwards, or feeles true heartie pleasure. To keepe his seruants from such deepe dispaire, Instructions he them giues, and warnings faire. 47 Of no one point so frequently he talked, When he and his Disciples were alone; When companie remou'd they solely walked, This peece of Text, most commonly, was one. Matth. 16. Marke 10. Luke 18. Iohn 12.Th' Euangelists doe all of them record it, Th' Apostles when they heard thereof, abhor'd it. 48 Once walking fairely to Ierusalem, (The place that for his suffring was appointed) Marke 10. 32.As of his Passion he discours't to them. Like men amaz'd, their members halfe disioynted; They stood as if they knew not where they were, With terror much affrighted, and with feare. 49 Their Lord who knew their harts, which way they b?ded, How much the name of Crosses them afflicted; How at his Passion they would be offended, How with their owne hard trialls, more deiected: Oft comforts them with greatnesse of the pay, To his true Souldiers at the later day. 50 Now Isr'els King is on his sacred march, Palme-sunday. A solemne feast-day 'twas among the Iewes: The Prophets tell you, if yee please to search, Es. 62. 11. Zech. 9. 9. An Asses colt to ride on, he would choose: Thereby is noted his humilitie, Yet here be further signes of Maiestie. 51 The people entertayne him as a King. Some strawe the way with branches from the trees, Some with their clothes: and all Hosanna sing, Flocking about him like a swarme of Bees. Thus to the Towne in triumph he was brought, Which in the Citie much amazement wrought. 52 The time vnto his Passion drawing neere, Matth. 21. He leaues some markes of his Diuinitie: The Temple from profaners he doth cleere, Then heales the lame, and makes the blinde to see. The children crie Hosanna here againe, Whereat the Priests offended doe complaine. 53 The Temples and the Cities ouerthrow, Tokens of the Temples and the Cities destruction, with the end of the world intermixed. Matth. 24. (A newes at first strange-sounding in their eares) As farre as he saw fit for them to know, By certaine signes and tokens he declares: To lift their mindes from base imaginations, And fix them all on heauenly cogitions. 54 He tells them of a dreadfull time of horror. False prophets, yea false christs there will arise, Fierce warres betwixt all Nations bringing terror, Plagues, famine, earthquakes causing wofull cries: Yet this of sorrowes is but the beginning, A finer thread of mischeiues will be spinning. 55 Vext shall you be, and killed for my sake, By brothers, and by neerest kin betraide: Iniquitie shall such free passage make, As all the heate of loue will be allaide. Yet feare you not, be constant to the end, The rich reward shall all defaults amend. 56 Know this, though raging Tyrants Truth assaile, In hope the Gosples shining light to darken: Their tyrannie therein shall not preuaile, All Nations on the earth to it shall hearken. It must be for a witnesse to them all, To comfort such as come when I doe call. 57 The Sunne and Moone shall lose their wonted light, The Starres fall downe from-out the firmament, The powres of Heauen shall be shaken quite, It is probable the signe of the Crosse to be here meant (without tach of superstition.)And then My Signe afore me shall be sent, That wicked men beholding it may crie, Because my selfe in glorie am so nie. 58 Then shall my Angels swiftly flie about, With trumpets sound, much lowder then the thunder: My chosen seruants they shall single-out, And from the wicked seuer them a-sunder. The heau'n and earth must fade without all cure, The wordes I speake, shall certainly endure. 59 Against all crosses here's a consolation, A compleat armour persecution-proofe; Not forg'd by spels, or planet-constellation, But by the Sonne of God for our behoofe. Let's put on this, and all the powres of Hell Ephes. 6. Cannot so harme vs, but we shall doe well. 60 When friends that long haue lou'd, and liu'd together, A Simile By chance or choise a-sunder must depart, Where parting is a cutting griefe to either: To hold each others memorie in heart, Some friendly token left by one behind, Makes th' other alwayes keepe his friend in mind. 61 Our Lord, the truest friend that euer lou'd, (Lord, Master, Friend, and Brother all in one.) Though sundrie wayes he carefully had prou'd, To cause vs thinke on him when he was gone: Yet left he to his louers such a pledge, As giues the bluntest heart, a sharper edge. 62 The pledge he left was not a peece of gold, Nor (as most louers vse) a pretie ring; A jewell 'tis, not to be bought, nor sold, Himselfe (in truth) it is no worser thing. He parting left (in sort) himselfe behinde: True faith must search this mysterie to finde. 63 The Pascall supper he ordaynes to eate, Matth. 26. That Lambe, was of himselfe a perfect type: His precious Bodie was (indeed) the meate, Which with our faith, not with our teeth, we gripe. The legall Supper ended, his beginnes: Which faithfull eaters clenseth from their sinnes. 64 Th' Apostles twelue sate with him at the boord, Amongst those twelue one Iudas there was found, Who lou'd his money better then his Lord: He with the Priests for siluer did compound, To doe a Trayt'rous deed so full of shame, That Traytors euer since, doe beare his name. 65 Iob. 6. 70.The treason he could not so closely worke, But that his Master long before descri'd it: He knew what mischiefe in his heart did lurke, The Traytor with his cunning could not hide it. But when he found his falshood was bewrai'd, Out of their presence he himselfe conuaid. 66 Mary Magdalen. Matth. 26.Against this wretched man we may oppose, A woman famous for her pietie: Shee that a box of precious ointment chose, T'anoint our Lord there with before he die, Luk. 7.Washing his feet in it, mixt with her teares, And often kissing wip't them with her haires. 67 The mention of this worthy pious deed, My sacred Muse by no meanes would omit: That all who doe these hallowed verses reade, May note what honour shee attayn'd by it. Her memorie eternized thereby, Matth. 26. 13.'Mongst all professing Christianitie. 68 The Traytor greatly grudged at this cost, Pretending care and loue vnto the poore: As now it is bestow'd, he counts it lost, Then presently he gets him out of doore, And sells his Master to recouer that, Which in his greedie thought he gaped at. 69 Was euer such a wicked wretch as hee? Was euer yet so soule a treason plotted? If any such false Iudasses there bee, A Iudas death to them were well allotted. But leaue we these, and turning to the Text, The circumstances note ensuing next. 70 A sacred supper, banquet most diuine, He institutes, wherein himselfe is eaten By faithfull feeders on the bread and wine: (Vnworthy eaters shrewdly shall be beaten.) 1. Cor. 11. 27. He bids vs eate his Body, drinke his Blood: A blessed myst'rie, rightly vnderstood. 71 Here is that pledge whereof before I spake, Modo sacramentali &amp; in effabilè percipimus Christum. Hoc fides credat, intelligentia non requirat, ne non inuentum putetur in credibile, aut repertum putetur non singulare. Presentiam credo, mod? nescio. Iob. 6. 52. No figure bare. (Such phantasies I loth.) His Body and his Bloud he wills vs take, We must beleeue he truly offers both. Be sure 'tis so, for Christ vs'd no deceits: Yet aske not how, so did the Capernaits. 72 As often as this Supper we partake, Our Sauiors goodnesse we must call to mind; Remembring what he suffred for our sake, Each other loue, as he to vs was kind. How can those men, which feast thus oft together, Note here the most diuine comfortable conference of Christ with his Apostles, immediately after his last holy supper: And in his iourney to the' Garden. Iob. chap. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Liue out of loue, or one oppresse the other? 73 The Iewish supper, and the Christian ended; Before the acting of this tragedie, Some passages deserue to be intended, Diuinely written in the historie. More choise then here (if I be not mistooke) You shall not find in all the holy booke. 74 No sooner was the traytor gone abroade, To worke that deed of darknes in the night; But Christ vnto the rest a lecture rode, To strengthen them against the future fight. First as for him, they should not be offended; His death vnto his greater glorie tended. 75 (Humbling himselfe to dye vpon the crosse, In sight of men a shamefull ignominie, He gat encrease of honour, and no losse; For God the Father lifted him on hie, Where in such glorie hee is seated now, Phil. 2. 9.All knees should at the name of Iesus bowe.) 76 You, for a time, shall find of me the lacke, Where I am going, yet you cannot come: Meane while in Loue see that you bee not slacke, Doe mutually, as I to you haue done. Herein you shall expresse your loue to mee, If constant 'mong your selues in loue you bee. 77 Iob. 14.At my departure ought you not to grieue, 'Tis for your good, if you perceiu'd the case: As in my Father, so in mee belieue, My going is to get for you a place, And though I goe, I'll shortly come againe, That you with mee, for euer may remaine. 78 I am my selfe, the Way, the Truth, the Life, No man comes to the Father but by mee: Thomas and Philip.Heere some of them were at a little strife, Not vnderstanding what the sense might bee. With words of comfort hee resolues them both, Then forward in his gracious speeches go'th. 79 In seeing mee you all haue scene my Father, I dwell in him he likewise dwells in mee: For my great workes you ought beleeue the rather; So, greater workes by you perform'd shall bee. And what you aske the Father in my Name, Doubt not of speeding; I will doe the same. 80 Another cause of comfort doth ensue, A promise of the Comforter: euen hee The Spirit of Truth, that shall abide in you, Sent by the Father, comes also from mee. I will not leaue you comfortlesse, be sure; If for a while you patiently endure. 81 Who doth as I command, he loues me well, This is the triall of a trusty friend: With such my Father and my selfe will dwell, And make abode with him vnto the end. But he which to my precepts giues no eare, That man to me no loue at all doth beare. 82 Though I depart, I'll leaue my peace behind, Not worldly peace, which hath no comfort in it: My peace rests in your heart, and in your mind, Striue to attaine this inward peace, and winne it. My absence you the better may abide, If my true peace doe in your hearts reside. 83 Lastly my parting should not make you sad, For passing to my Fathers companie: You ought reioyce hereat, and be more glad, For hee, I tell you, greater is then I. These speeches ended from the boord he rose, Then foorth vpon his latest iourney goes. 84 Job. 15.The neerer to this conflict he approacheth, Full well discerning their infirmitie: New comfortable doctrines hee still broacheth, T'encourage them against aduersitie. A parable hee sets before their eyne, Of quicke, and witherd branches of a vine. 85 A parable of the vine and branches.The branches wither, cut once from the tree, They serue to no vse else, but for the fire: Dead branches y'are, except ye bide in mee, Men cast you out, and burning is your hire, Abide in mee, continue fruit to beare, So shall you grow more fruitfull then yee were. 86 You are my friends, if you my words fulfill, No more by name of seruants I you call: The seruant knoweth not his masters will, But I haue shew'd you, from my father all. And I haue chosen you vnto this end, That, being fruitfull, I might be your frend. 87 The world will hate you, as it hated me, It loueth only such as bee his owne: Now from the world sith I haue set you free, Loue at the worldlings hands, you shall find none. Expect not to scape better then your Master, You must drinke after me, I am your taster. 88 Least at my crosse you all should be offended, Iob. 16.Forsake the truth, for feare of persecution: My speach vpon this point so long is bended, To make you firme, and constant in conclusion. I say againe you must endure affliction, If you will get the heauenly benediction. 89 The Priests will bolt-out Excommunication, And banish you from all their holy rites, They'l reck on you as vessels of damnation: That done, to execute their further spites, Your liues they'l shorten with the ciuill rod, And thinke they doe good seruice vnto God. 90 Remember well, when these things take effect, How I forewarn'd you of them long before: These words (I see) your spirits doe deiect, Whereas in truth your ioy should be the more. That Comforter, else to you will not come, But I will send him after I am gone. 91 He in the way of truth will you conduct. The Oracles of God to you reueale, In many things to come, will you instruct, No needfull point of knowledge hee'l conceale. He shall receiue of mine, and giue to you: For, all the Father hath, is mine by due, 92 The time is short I haue with you to stay. Yet shortly I will come to you againe: Vp to the Father I must leade the way, My absence will procure you griefe and paine. The world will liue in mirth, whilst you doe mourne: But soone your sorrowes into ioy shall turne. 93 As women when their trauaile first drawes on, A Comparison. With feare and anguish sorely be opprest: The Child once borne, and their hard throwes all gone, Then ioy of Child-birth sets their hearts at rest. So will I come and rid you of your paine, That neuer after shall you grieue againe. 94 Then in my Name ye shall not need aske ought, The Father holds you deare in his owne sight, And knowes your wants ere you of them haue thought; He loues you, cause in my loue you delight. Into the world I from my Father came, Now from the world, returne I to the same. 95 Say, was not this sweet after-suppers talke: A daintie later-course to such a feast? Could euer Man be wearie so to walke? Who would not here haue gladly beene a ghest? The number of the ghests that time was small, But now this feast is open vnto all. 96 Iohn 17.Those exhortations and instructions past, To comfort them who stood thereof in need: Hee giues himselfe to prayer at the last, In reading it, to euery word take heed. My hand oft shakes in scribling of this song, For feare to doe the Sacred Myst'ries wrong. 97 The Author prayeth briefly(My Lord, here taught by thee, I turne to pray. I walke a pilgrime to the Land of rest; Vouchsafe to set and guide mee in the way, To thee alone my humble suit's addrest. Psalme 45.My heart of heau'nly matters doth endite, Oh teach my pen, how readily to write, 98 Not Sonnet-wise, Nor in heroicke verse With stile affected, praise of men to gaine: But modestly deepe myst'ries to rehearse; In meeter tuned to a lowly straine: True Soule-delighting, not eare-tickling layes, That may my readers hearts to heauen raise.) 99 My heau'nly Father, now the houre is come, Our Sauiours most sweet and louing prayer before he entred into the garden. Iohn 17. (Hee speakes with eyes right lifted vp to heauen.) By thee ordain'd to glorifie thy Sonne, That thou by him be glorifide agen. My glorie to thy owne so sure is knit, No power is able once to seuer it. 100 All flesh thou hast subiected to his power, 1. He prayeth for himselfe. For all the race of men he is to die: Yet those that come to him they bee the fewer, Certes themselues are in the fault, not I. For none haue life but such as knowing thee To be true God, doe learne the same of mee. 101 By me on earth thou hast beene glorifi'de, All thou commanded'st me, that haue I done: Now with thy selfe let mee bee dignifi'de, In that full height, as ere the world begun, I did enioy the same in Vnitie, The second person in the Trinitie. 102 Herein by mee thy glory hath beene sought, In that through my great miracles and teaching; To knowledge thee all nations haue beene brought, And train'd to vertuous liuing by my preaching. Those whom thou gauest mee, they were thy owne, And by my meanes, thou art to them made knowne. 103 The word I taught them, that they soundly keepe, Not flitting in the grounds of their beliefe: From mee they haue receiu'd thy secrets deepe, They surely hold this point which is the chiefe. That I came downe from thee with full commission, To giue repentant sinners whole remission. 104 2. For the Apostles in particular.I pray for them (precisely) in this place, Whom thou hast geu'n mee by a speciall choice: For worldly men which feele not of thy grace, I doe not pray: They will not heare my voyce. But these are thine, by thy owne free election; And mine, by truly yeelding mee subiection. 105 Now need they most thy fatherly defence, Sith in the world they yet haue their abiding: I come to thee and am departing hence, Therefore (good Father) keepe thou them from sliding Keepe them in concord, loue and vnitie, That they may all bee one, like thee and mee. 106 Whilst here with them I had my conuersation, I kept them in thy truth without suspition: All that thou gauest mee shall get saluation, Saue only that lost child, Sonne of perdition, Psal. 69. 109.To whom it fell as Scriptures had forespoken, Of which one title neuer can be broken. 107 Now must I leaue the world, and come to thee; My pers'nall presence they can haue no longer; Which makes mee pray for them thus hartely, That by thy ayde, they may be made the stronger: Till they in sprituall knowledge bee well skill'd, To see and feele my ioy in them fulfill'd. 108 Thy word and truth to them I haue declar'd, Whereto with full assent they did obaye: And cause with worldly men they haue not shar'd In vnbeliefe, nor walked in their way; The world alike doth hate both them, and mee: For light and darknesse neuer will agree. 109 Out of the world I would not haue them taken, But pray thee keepe them euermore from euill; That in their faith they neuer may be shaken, Nor ouercome by falshood of the Deuill. Thy Word and Truth so sanctifie their harts, That in their calling they may doe their parts. 110 As thou thy Sonne into the world didst send, To teach thy Truth: (They hate me for my paine) So sent I them vnto that very end. (Like thankes as had their Master, they shall gaine.) The more they need thy fatherly assistance, Since in the world they shall find great resistance. 111 'Tis for their sakes my selfe I sanctifie, A sacrifice to clense them from their sinne: I freely offer vp my selfe to die, That they eternall life thereby may winne. I pray thee therefore (Father) them preserue, That from thy Truth, and Faith they neuer swerue. 112 I make not my request for these alone, 3. Thirdly he prayeth for all the faithfull in generall, to the worlds end. But for Beleeuers all that e're will be: That in true faith and loue they may be one, As I in thee, and thou likewise in me. To th' end all people of the world may see, And surely know that I came out from thee. 113 The glorie which on me thou hast bestow'd, To turne the world from darknesse, vnto light: By preaching and by wonders: that hath flow'd From me, on them who doe beleeue aright. To proue that as thou loued'st me thy sonne, So lou'st thou those, which to my faith are wonne. 114 My Father, this is also my desire, That mine may euer in my presence dwell: There to behold my glorie, and admire How much all Kings in glorie I excell. Nor barely to behold, but to partake, So much, as shall them also glorious make. 115 2. Cor. 1.The worldly-wise were meerely ignorant, Of Ghostly things pertaining vnto thee: Of fruitlesse idle knowledge they could vaunt, But I haue knowne, and mine haue learn'd of mee: Yea in true knowledge they shall still proceed, Vntill they know as much as serues their need. 116 A prayer of all prayers most diuine, Where true-loue-passions sweetly are exprest; In which our Sauiours Loue doth cleerely shine, On all that in his Churches bosome rest: A Christian man who reades it with deuotion, Must needs feele in his heart some heau'nly motion. 117 What greater comfort can beleeuers haue, Then know the Sonne of God to be their friend? That of his Father he for them doth craue, And will not faile of speeding in the end? The man which of this comfort hath no feeling, His zeale is like a toole that lacketh steeling. 118 A Comparison.Who so presents his suit vnto a King, And hath his onely Sonne for intercessor: If he petition for a lawfull thing, Hee's very like to be thereof possessor. Christus cum patre, particeps est imperii.Christ is in th' Empire partner with his Father, His fauourites are sure to speed the rather. 119 What mou'd our Lord so often to repeate, Of old constant Martyrs. And vrge this point, of suffring for his sake? Whence comes it that so long, and with such heate This prayer to his Father he did make? By greatnesse of th' approaching persecution, He knew his men had need of resolution. 120 To him that bloudie Tyrants heart was seene, Nero the Tyrant. Who turning Natures course cleane vp-side-downe. His mothers wombe ript-vp with Razor keene, Who made a bone-fire of th' Emperiall towne, Then on the Christians laid that imputation, Thereby to make them odious to the Nation. 121 Who with the prime Apostles first began, Peter and Paul. In one houres space made riddance of them twaine, Then wreakes his wrath on woman, childe, and man, Takes great delight to see them put to paine. Thus to his Idols sacrific'de the Saints, And beastly pleas'd himselfe with their complaints. 122 The rest of those accursed persecutors, Which had their seat within that fatall Citie, Our Lord foresawe with all their coadiutors, Who on tormented Martyrs tooke no pitie: But of their grieuous tortures made a sport, In Theaters for people to resort. 123 An ordinarie death seru'd not the turne, Strange kinde of executions are inuented: Some softly fri'de that they might slowly burne, Some cut with Sawes as if they were indented: Some rent with Beares, wilde Bulls, and hungrie Dogs, And other some, deuour'd by filthy Hogs. 124 Had not these Martyrs need of Christ his ayde, To make them patient in so great afflictions? Would not meere flesh and bloud haue beene affrayde, Against fierce Tyrants threatning interdictions, To hold their Creed, and constantly confesse it, When they by rigour labour'd to represse it? 125 Christs prayer had efficacy in all Confessors and Martyrs and euer will haue.With helpe from heau'n (no doubt) they were relieu'd, The efficacie of Christs intercession, Instills new comfort when they most are grieu'd, Confirmes beliefe, emboldens to confession. Weake in our selues, through him we are made strong, Bold for his cause, to suffer any wrong. 126 I take this prayer of so strange effect, So pow'rfull to obtaine what it requires: That God the Father beares it such respect, If we, for whom 'twas made, ioyne our desires: The vertue of it to vs now extendeth, And so will doe vntill the world endeth. 127 These were the preparations to the fight, Then our Great Champion comes within the lists: Matth. 26. 31.First he foretells his Souldiers of their flight, (Though one more forward then the rest, resists.) As when the Shepherd is beat off, and smitten, The Sheepe are scatterd, catcht by Woolues, and bitten. 128 Here Peter speakes for one before them all; (As vsually he did at other place) Though euery man besides doe from thee fall, Yet I will be exempted in this case. Iob. 33. 37.Bee sure of mee (my Lord) I for thy sake, Am full resolu'd, to lay my life at stake. 129 Doubtlesse he spake no more then what he meant, He lou'd too well, to make a shew with glozing: His heart was good, and so was his intent, (Of what we purpose God hath the disposing.) The man too much on his owne strength depended, And for his rashnesse soone was reprehended. 130 Wilt thou (saith Christ) lay downe thy life for mee? 'Tis faire and friendly spoken with a trice, Thy heart will faile: marke what I say to thee, The Cock crowes not, till thou denie me thrice, A rare example of mans imperfection, When God once leaues him, to his owne direction. 131 Now enters he into Mount Oliuet, The beginning of his Passion, with his agonie and bloudy sweat in the garden, at Mount Oliuet. Wherein the Garden was, or very neere it: His Passions-first-encounters here he met, So strong they were, that he confest to feare it. With griefe and sorrow he was so opprest, His Soule within him could not be at rest. 132 Three of his choise Disciples him attended, Antithesis betwixt the vision on Mount Tabor, and the agonie on Mount Oliuet. Looke Stan. 23. The same who on Mount Tabor sawe the vision: They were well pleased there, but here offended, This agonie, vnlike that apparition: That place they wished for their habitation, Here they were drowzie, void of consolation. 133 He in his wonted manner falls to pray, Commanding them with him awhile to watch: And parting therehence but a little way, They slumbering, a nap begin to fetch: Whilst he lyes prostrate flat vpon his face, And humbly to his God commends his case. 134 He prayed with his face flat on the ground.His agonie we may conceaue was great, Exprest by prayers threefold repetition: By humble gesture, and by bloudie sweat, By sticking to it without intermission: Onely for his Disciples, care he takes, From sleepe, with admonitions, them awakes. 135 He prayes his Father take from him this Cup, The Crosse, which he perceau'd so neere at hand: Entreateth that he may not drinke it vp, Yet gladly doth to this condition stand. If it accord so with his Fathers will, Which for his part hee's readie to fulfill. 136 A lesson for all Christen men to learne, Rom. 8. 26.Because we know not how aright to pray, What's fit, what not, vnable to discerne, By ignorance doe often walke astray: Whensoeuer to our God we make petition, Let it be done vpon the same condition. 137 Iudas with his traine,Now comes the Traytor with his Iudas kisse, (The reading of it makes me feare, and blush.) His troupe a rablement of rake-hells is, The signe once giu'n, vpon our Lord they rush. Sent by the Priests.With swords and staues, as 'twere to take a Thiefe; These acted, yet the Priests and Scribes were chiefe. 138 Peter strikes with his sword.Heere Peter his late promise to make good, (Like him that meant not bulged) drawes out his sword: He strikes at one who 'mongst that Rabble stood Cut off his eare, which Christ heal'd with a word: Rebuked him for zeale vs'd out of season, Proues that his doing wanted ground of reason. 139 Thou need'st not draw thy sword in my defence, Reprehended for so doing. Were I dispos'd to rid me of their hand: Most speedily I could conuey me hence, Passe through the midst of them as heere they stand. Eu'n with a word I can them all confound, And lay them prostrate flat vpon the ground. 140 Hast thou forgot, when they came first to take me, Iob. 18. 6. 7. My voyce no sooner sounded in their eare: But they fell backwards readie to forsake me, All daunted and astonished with feare: Till by my second speech I shew'd assent, They might performe the deed 'bout which they went. 141 Or thinkest thou, were I dispos'd to fight, I stand in need of Iron, or of Steele? No: Legions wait on me of Angels bright, One of them could make all this troupe to reele: But sith the Scriptures say, Thus it must be, I am content they haue their will on mee. 142 Then all th' Apostles turne their backes, and flye: He, and all the rest of the Apostles flie. He (with the rest) who lately 'gan to fight, Few houres before, who vow'd with Christ to die: (Too much it seemes they trusted their owne might.) Both he and they prou'd constant afterwards, And of their suffrings, now enioy rewards. 143 Nor fled they till their Lord forbid them fighting, So long as they expected his assistance, They knew his pow'r, and liu'd in hope of righting: But when they saw he would vse no resistance, Then euery man begins to shift for one, And left their Master with his foes alone. 144 Christ led bound to Caiphas.As yet they had not vsed violence, His person seized on, he straight is bound, Hence forth begins their rage and insolence: First, search is made what witnesse may be found, Some false were had, but they appeared such, As disagreeing him they would not touch. 145 False witnesses suborned.At last came two, who vnder shew of troth, Misconstruing words which long before he spake, Auouch't alie, and made it good by oath, That he the Temple could destroy and make An other in three dayes as good as that: The Counsell seem'd well satisfied thereat. 146 Simple proofe to condemne one to death.The Priest layes hold on this poore allegation, As of a point that toucht him somewhat nie, Whereon he grounds a fresh examination: But Christ to it vouchsaft not a replie. Had it beene so iust as the witnesse spake, An vpright Iudge thereof could nothing make. 147 Like Iudge, like Witnesse.But Iudge and Witnesse here were much alike. What hope of Iustice in so bad a Court? They iudge, accuse, and for false witnesse seeke, Proofe or no proofe, Christ needes must suffer for't. Iob. 11. 50.The Priest vnweeting did so prophecie, That he of force must for the people die. 148 They c?demne him vpon his owne wordes, for speaking the truth.Yet Caiphas casts about another way, Those proofes of men suborn'd, fell out but od: He chargeth Christ in briefe the truth to say, Thereto adiures him by the liuing God, To tell him whether he be very Christ, The true Messias, Sonne vnto the high'st. 149 He wayues it not, but doth the thing auerre, Matth. 26. 64. And thereto addes a fearfull commination, Which might them from their wickednesse deterre: You shall (saith he) once see strange alteration, Mee comming in the cloudes with maiestie, And all the powers of the Deitie. 150 Now from this time the scene begins grow hot. They iudge him a blasphemer, and worthy to die. Those wordes put Caiphas halfe out of his wits, He rents his clothes, and does he knowes not what, But like a Bedlam taken in his fits, Cryes out, This man hath spoken blasphemie, What thinke yee of't? They say, hee's fit to die. 151 Then in his face they all begin to spit, They spit on him, beat and abuse him. (A fashion onely fitting for a Iew) Some with their fists, some with their rods him smit, And thus our Lord among this cursed crew, Was vs'd with all the vilde indignities, That wit and malice 'gainst him could deuize. 152 The Traytor seeing how the cause succeeded, Christ thus condemned through his trecherie: His heart with shame, and horror freshly bleeded, Repents himselfe, though but dispayringly; Brought back the money to the Priests, and sayd, In sinning I haue guiltlesse bloud betrayd. 153 The wretch, in this hard state of desperation, Repaires to those who set him on to doe it, Hoping to finde with them some consolation: What's that to vs (quoth they) looke thou vnto it. This harsh reply his conscience so intangled, That prest with shame and griefe, himselfe he strangled. 154 The passages about Peters deniall.'Tis said, how Peter followed Christ afarre, His purpose was to see, and note the end: Not thinking to haue found so hot a warre, The issue doth his vertue more commend. All's well, that ends well. True it is indeed: As Peter sped, I wish we all may speed. 155 Note yet the frailtie of this holy Saint, 'Mong all his fellowes taken for the chiefe: What small occasions moued him to faint, Denie his Lord, and fayle in his beliefe. Two seely wenches made him say and sweare, He knew him not. (A matter strange to heare.) 156 Anon againe, a little further prest, By men who gaue some tokens to discrie him: With othes and curses, worse then all the rest, He faceth out, that they doe all belye him. So crowes the cocke, Christ backe on him doth looke, To bitter teares then he himselfe betooke. 157 We fall from Christ, though not by flat deniall, By slips that differ little in effect: And like it is, if most were put to triall, In constancie there would be found defect. Yet if for faults with Peter we would weepe, The wounds will soone be cur'd, though they be deepe. 158 Bare weeping in this case sufficeth not, 2. Cor. 7. Heb. 12. 17.All sorrow makes not truely penitent: The sorrow which our sinnes doth cleanly blot, Is ioyn'd with faith, and liues amendement. The Traitor sorrowing, had nor faith, nor hope, But in despaire prouides himselfe a rope. 159 The blest Apostle hastens from the Hall, The paterne of a true penitent, in the person of Saint Peter. Forsakes the concourse of that hellish crue: Retir'd alone, downe on his knees doth fall, Thrice knockes his brest, salt teares his cheekes bedewe, With sighes and sobs his heart begins to swell, His soule so vext, as if 'twere then in hell. 160 His eyes and hands he vp to heauen doth hold, But shame forthwith constraines him cast them downe: As fearing least therein hee were too bold, And thinkes the God of heau'n doth on him frowne: Till mindfull of his Masters gratious glaunce, Begins with hope his hanging head t'aduaunce. 161 Then thus hee sayes: vnhappie wretched man, No sooner were his lips set ope to speake, In vaine he striues: For doe what e're hee can, With throbbings fresh, his heart is readie breake. New showres of teares descended downe so fast, They brought him neere the point to breathe his last. 162 Much like a gentle Virgin, tender hearted, A Comparison. Linckt to a noble pheere in true affection; If by some sad disaster they bee parted, Shee doubting of her modest loues reiection, Liues onely by the hope of reobtayning Her honour'd mate, all comfort else refrayning. 163 This holy man, thus passionate awhile, Recounting with himselfe his great offence, In hope his iniur'd Lord to reconcile, Resolues to wayue all colour of defence, And meekely prostrate at his Throne of Grace, Repenting sues for pardon in that place. 164 First here my fault I humbly doe confesse, A fault for which thou iustly mayst reiect mee, Doome mee to hell, (Sith I deserue no lesse) Yet in thy mercie (gentle Lord) respect mee: Restore mee to thy fauour as afore, Vp-hold me with thy Grace, from falling more, 165 Too much I trusted late to my owne strength, Presum'd no persecutions blasts should ouer-blow me From thy sweet side: But I haue prou'd at length, That puffes of maydens mouthes did ouerthrow me: It rents my heart to thinke so weake a triall, Should force thy seruant to so strong deniall. 166 I see, when man vnto himselfe is left, No powre he hath to keepe himselfe from sliding: The great'st and best, Once of thy grace bereft, Can find no place of rest, or sure abiding: Those onely stand, whom thou by grace dost stay, Without thy sauing Grace, they fall away. 167 What dost thou (Lord) of sinfull men require, But from hearts-bottome, true vnfeyn'd confession? Loe, I confessing, pardon doe desire, My heart, thou knowest, is humbled with contrition: To satisfie the Iustice, I'm not able: With mercie wash me white, now wholly sable. 168 My fall shall be a warning vnto others, Not in their might, but in thy aide to trust: Not to thinke of themselues aboue their brothers: Sith all offenders are, thou onely iust. From Iustice to thy mercie I appeale, Giue balme of grace, my wounded Soule to heale. 169 Then in thy sauing health I shall reioyce, Endeauour still thy holy Lawes to keepe: To yeeld thee praise and thankes, with heart and voice, And follow thee my Pastour, I thy sheepe: Confirming others, when I am made strong, And die a Martyr (through thy grace) ere long. 170 Of true and false repentance here we find, Two rare examples, written for our learning: They both repented in a different kind, From th' one comes comfort, from the other warning. The one repenting gat encrease of grace, The other lost his office, and his place. Acts 1. 20. 171 Returne wee to our blessed Sauiours storie, To note the passages anent his passion: Wee left him in the Iewish Consistorie, Where they giue sentence for his condemnation. The cause with them long hangs not in debate, They doom'd him dead ere they in iudgement sate. Iob. 11. 50. 172 Earely next morne with speed they led him bound, They bring Christ bound to Pilat; Before the ciuill Romane Magistrate: The Priests and Elders stood in compasse round, To worke the surer on him with their hate: As men resolu'd by malice, or by might, To get him nayled on the Crosse ere night, 173 Two heads I note of Iewish accusation, From whence they seeke to hasten his destruction: First, 'gainst the Law of God, and of their Nation, His blasphemie: (made so by their construction.) Vpon this point, They for their parts decreed, Ther's no release, but he must die with speed. 174 The next is affectation of the Crowne, Wherein they hoped of the Romans ayde: Iob. 19. 12.And that was it in fine which bare him downe, When Pilat to condemne him, stood afraid. Hee treated with the Iewes for his discharge, And gladly would haue let him goe at large. 175 Pilats wiues dreame.His wife affrights him with this allegation, The man and cause are iust, pray deale not in it, I know it by a kind of Diuination. For this last night I in my dreame haue seene it. So thought hee of a way to let him loose, But left it to the Priests and Scribes to choose. 176 They chose Barabas.'Twas vsed in this feast, That by their choyce, One Pris'nor should bee set at libertie: Of Christ and Barabas hee askes their voyce, The Priests, and People (mou'd by them) all crye, Let Barabas the thiefe come on our side, And as for Christ, let him be crucifide, 177 Monsters of men! What Canibals were here, Or rather Diuells in a humane shape! An innocent to quell, a thiefe to cleere, Condemne the Iust, and let a Murth'rer scape! Though Pilat did condemne him, yet he acknowledged him to be innocent. They cry three times, CrucifigeWhom Iudas, Pilat, and his Wife acquited, Against their conscience, falsely they indited. 178 Once Crucifige could not so preuaile, But that the Iudge perswades them to relent: The second time more hotly they assaile, On Crucifige all their breath is spent: Luke 23. 22.Thirdly with voyces strayn'd more lowd they crie, Whereon the Iudge gaue sentence he should die. 179 This wrongfull sentence fearefully pronounc't, Pilats hypocrisie in washing his hands. Before he mou'd out of the Iudgement Hall: Hee seemes as if the doing hee renounc't, And washeth cleane his hands before them all. This man (sayes he) was Iust, and I am free From guiltlesse bloud: Therefore to it So said they before to Iudas see yee, 180 One dreadfull Iudgement resteth yet behind, That curse, Or rather cursed execration, Which to this day the Iewish people find, Full heauily it hangs vpon their Nation: His bloud on vs, and on our children bee. Sanguis eius super nos, &amp; super filies nostros. They had their wish, as all the world may see. 181 A race of people runnagates on earth, A man may say, a nationlesse Nation: Some place they find (as casuall) for their birth, No certaine country for their habitation, That guiltlesse bloud as yet for vengeance cries, And as their fathers pray'd, vpon them lies, 182 In euill howr's some vse themselues to curse, 'Tis strange a man should take therein delight: Though all in doing so seeme not the worse, I wish my friend to doe himselfe more right, To curse no other man, himselfe much lesse. I would aduise him rather, both to blesse. 183 Streight after iudgement followes execution, First then the thiefe and murth'rer is enlarg'd, To freedome he obtayneth restitution; Our Lord committed to the Souldiers charge, The Gouernour commands him to bee whipt, In scorne the Souldiers cause him to be stript. 184 The Romane Souldiers deride and mock Christ.The whole pretorian band together flocke To Pilates house, within the common Hall, To sport themselues, and make of Christ a mocke, Like flies about him they begin to fall: Or purple.A scarlet Robe, such as by Kings are worne, They put vpon him, for the greater scorne. 185 And more to make him counterfeit a King, A crowne of thornes they set vpon his head: For Scepter, they a reede vnto him bring; Thus King-like when they haue him furnished, With bended knee, this taunting speech they vse, All Haile to thee thou Christ King of the Iewes. 186 As did the Iewes before, some on him spit, Some from his hand the reeden scepter take, Therewith vpon the head they doe him hit, And thus of him a ieasting-stocke they make. Disrobing him, with his owne clothes they dresse him, Then to the place of execution presse him. 187 An Amplification by way of Comparison, expressing the perfection of Christs passion.The Chartre-Pardon granted long agoe, To him who first rebell'd against heau'ns King: Hath euer since beene tossed to and fro, Ere to the Great-seale sutors could it bring: Types, Ceremonies and Sacrifices.Some priuie seales, and signets set vnto it, Yet wanting force effectually to doe it. 188 Gen. 3.By paroll past this grant in Paradise, To our great-grandsire Adam and his Wife: Whom that Arch-Traitor slilie did entice, To breed betwixt their Lord and them a strife. It hath beene long engrossing, now at length 'Tis perfected, and fully hath its strength, 189 Gods Sonne and Heyre apparant to the Crowne, Who onely had the pow're to make it good: To perfect it, from heau'n, descended downe, And for our sakes hath seal'd it with his bloud. To this Free-pardon euery man hath right, That sues it out. (The charges is but light.) 190 He by his latest Will and Testament, Bequeathes to all the Largis of this pardon: His comming hither was to that intent, To giue all true belieuers that rich guerdon. It's had of course, in forma pauperis, You pay no gold, nor siluer fee for this. 191 Loe, now the Lord of life is come to die, To 'byde the paines that we should haue endur'd: They crucifie him. From blessed state to feele all miserie, By Satan and his instruments procur'd. His willingnesse excuseth not their fault, Though he did well, their purposes were naught. 192 To circumstances all as they ensue, Sundry circumstances aggrauating the Passion, and iustifying the storie. With care and heed my reader must attend: Some doe conuince the storie to be true, Some are recorded to an other end; To aggrauate the greatnesse of the Passion, Endur'd in such an ignominious fashion. 193 'Mong heapes of dead mens skulls, and scattred bones, The place of dead mens skuls. (To strike more terrour by that vncouth sight) The crosse was set, it seemeth for the nonce, The Iewes did all they could to shew their spite. They know not what they doe (faith he) O Father, Therefore I pray thee pardon them the rather. 194 (So prayd Saint Steuen for his persecutors, A faire example for our imitation, Matth. 5. 44.A speciall lesson 'twas of this great Tutors, Who taught no cursing, neither execration. 1. Sam. 17. 43.The prowd Philistin fell to curse, and ban, What time he should haue shew'd himselfe a man.) 195 They hang him betweene two Theeues.They hang'd him vp betweene two Malefactors, Still seeking how to make him more despis'd: As if in theft they had beene all ioynt Actors. Say, was not this maliciously deuiz'd? They giue him vineger and gall.For drinke they gaue him Vineger and Gall. Cold charitie to comfort one withall. 196 They part his garments.His garments into quarters they diuide, 'Monst foure of them, each man a part doth take: Cast lots for his coat.For th' vnseam'd coat they otherwayes prouide, To trie for that, a lotterie they make. These things long time before were prophecy'de, And vnawares by them here verify'de. 197 The superscription vpon his Crosse.Vpon his Crosse is writ a superscription, In Hebrew letters, Latine, and in Greeke. Of Him and of his Cause a short description, That all might reade, and know't, if they would seeke. To all the world that Title told the newes, Matth. 27. 37.That This is Iesus the King of the Iewes. 198 Wherein appeared the hand of God.In this, Gods finger pow'refully was seene; The Priests were much displeased with the writing, And wisht that somewhat altred it had beene: But God led Pilates hand in that inditing. By accident here nothing came to passe, But as in heau'n before decreed it was. 199 “A hatred more then deadly, men call that “Which ouer-liues the death of him that's hated. In Iewish hearts such endlesse malice sat, As by our Sauiours death was not abated. Some Heathens pitied him, whilst Iewes reuil'd; The greater were his paines, the more they smil'd. 200 Some, wagging heads in scoffing wise did crie, The Iewes reuile and raile at him euen as he was dying. Thou that the Temple threatnedst to destroy, And in three dayes to reare it vp as hie, Now saue thy selfe, defend thee from annoy. Descend downe from the Crosse, if thou be able, Then will we hold thy Doctrine for no fable. 201 The Priests, the Scribes and Elders thus him taunted: Others he sau'd, himselfe let him reprieue, If he be Isr'els King as earst he vaunted, Let him come from the Crosse, so wee'll belieue. He put his trust in God: if God will haue him, (Whose Sonne he said I am) let God now saue him. 202 One of the Theeues likewise began to raile, Note the odde betwixt the two Theeues. His Mate thus roundly checks him for his error: Cannot the feare of God with thee preuaile, Nor thy iust iudgement strike in thee a terror? For our ill deeds we rightly suffer this, But he hath wrong, who did nothing amisse. 203 Then with a faith neuer enough admir'd, Directs his speech vnto our blessed Sauiour: A boone of him he heartily desir'd, His faith encourag'd him to that behauiour: Lord, to thy Kingdome when thou com'st, said hee, Though wretched I bee here, remember mee. 204 A Simile: or rather a dissimile.Hee sped not like a Sutor in some Court, Who happ'ning well to put in his petition, Expecting answere wayteth so long for't, (Lacking the meanes to pay for expedition) As in the end he sweareth by his gaynes, And onely gets his labour for his paynes. 205 But this Petitioner had a quick dispatch, A word of comfort to his full content: For thy preferment long thou shalt not watch, Before this very day be fully spent, Thy state shall be transmuted in such wise, As thou shalt rest with me in Paradise. 206 “Sweet solace! Not for that good man alone, “But for all such as doe him imitate: “Th' example serues for all, though prou'd by one, “For, true repentance neuer comes too late, Matth. 20.“Much lesse too soone: when God each man doth call, “Eu'n then to come, is fittest time for all. 207 Wonders and miracles at the death of Christ. Great darkenesse.From twelue a clocke till three at after-noone, A strange eclipse appear'd where they did stand: The Sunne gaue not his light, nor neuer shoone, But darknesse ouer-shadow'd all the Land. The Lord of Life, then at the point to die, To God allowd with strayned voyce did crie. 208 His Spirit to his Father he commends, Act. 7.(Did not the Protomartyr doe likewise?) With Consummatum est his life he ends; Then fully ended all the prophecies, The office of Messias was perfected, All types and figures after that reiected. 209 At his departure wonders strange appear'd. The Temple cleaues in two. From top to foot the Temple cleaues in twayne, (To shew that we from Iewish Rites were clear'd.) The Rocks are rent, the Earth doth quake amayne: The Rocks are rent. Yet Iewes were mou'd therewith no more then stocks, Their hearts were harder then the flintie Rocks. 210 The Graues and Tombes of Saints long dead, flew open: The Graues doe open. The Bodies rose, that many yeeres lay sleeping: The Resurrection this did well betoken, Saints long agone dead arise and appeare. That soule and body both are in Gods keeping. And 'cause no doubt thereof should rest in any, Within the Citie they were seene of many. 211 It makes me halfe forget my selfe with wonder, To thinke how much those stubborn Iewes were blinded: What held their hearts from bursting quite asunder, What passion made the men so grossely minded, That these great signes and tokens neuer mou'd them, Where senselesse things, &amp; Heathen men reprou'd them. 212 The Captaine or Centurion of the band, The Centurions conuersion, and confession: with his souldiers. With Souldiers for the watch attending there: At those strange sights did all amazed stand, Extreamly moued in their hearts with feare: Confest that this was certenly Gods Sonne, For whom so many miracles were done. 213 These were the men that some few howres before, See before at Stan. 161. Derided, scoft, and scorn'd him in the Hall: It seemeth now they were agrieu'd therefore, By this confession which they here let fall. It's like that diuers of them were conuerted, Matth. 21. 11. Though some by Iewish Rulers were peruerted. 214 Holy women.Of holy Iewish Women not a few, (Some nam'd in honour of their memorie) Attended thereabouts in modest shew, To doe their duties at his obsequie. Luke 23. 56.Of Spice and Ointments they prepared store, T'embalme that body which they lou'd before, 215 To bring him to the graue in decent-wise, As well beseem'd a man of no meane place, According to his natiue countrey guise: Ioseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus. Iob. 19. 38.Two men of speciall note did him that grace. Yet, ere his body taken from the tree, One thing deserueth well obseru'd to bee. 216 Not a bone of him broken, but his side pierced.Of both the Theeues wee read the legs were broken, Onely his side they pierced with a speare: By holy Prophets so it was fore-spoken, The prophecies were full accomplisht here. Thus wrapt in Spice, and rowll'd in linnen clothes, Vnto the Tombe that Sacred bodie goes. 217 His new tombeWhat kind of Tombe? not dig'd in sand or clay, But neat and cleanly, hew'ne out of a rocke: The Tombe was new, wherein no man ere lay; To take from Priests and Scribes all cause of mocke, That some good man interred there of yore, And not our Lord, to life God did restore. 218 A Comparison.His bodie comming from a Virgins wombe, Wherein no bodie euer came, but it: Was aptly buried in a Mayden-tombe, Th' analogie therein doth finely fit. Here leaue wee this blest bodie, for three dayes: Then sing how God to life the same did rayse. The end of the sixt Classis. The seuenth Classis. THE ARGVMENT. Iewes Priests decyphred by a short digressing. The storie of Christs glorious Resurrection, Each circumstance the veritie expressing, 'Gainst Sadduces and Epicures suggestion. Th' Ascension prou'd: Doomes-day laid ope to view The Blisse of Saints; Woes of the damned crew. 1 Mvse, stop the source of thy diuine narration, Christs body lay intombed from the euening on friday to Sunday morning: viz part of two dayes, and one whole Sabbath. Whilst that our Lord within his Tombe lyes sleeping: Betake thee to some holy Meditation, Spend one whole Sabbath in laments, and weeping. A solemne Iewish feast, and Sabbath day, In which that Sacred Body sprightlesse lay. 2 A Sabbath, yet in truth no day of rest: A day in name, more properly a night: Dispaire and feare the faithfull hearts possest, Their Sunne eclipst, imparts to them no light. Blinde Iewish Rulers, of their damn'd deed vaunted, When Christs Disciples wofully were daunted. 3 Me thinkes I see, as pictur'd in a Table, (That day in which the Lord of Life lay dead.) A crue of Rabbins seeming venerable, Walke arme in arme, each one the other led: Ioyous they seem'd, for what they late had done, In killing Christ the Carpenters poore Sonne. 4 Iewish Priests decyphered, insulting ouer Christ crucified.How did the man (quoth one) our state abuse, So poore in port, so meane in his condition: To claime this Royall Stile, King of the Iewes, A testimonie of his vaine ambition! Well are wee now from that poore King set free, For our Messias must a Conqueror bee. 5 The famous Prophet Moses long agoe, Foretold our Fathers, such a one as hee God would raise vp, to saue vs from our foe, And crowne vs with perpetuall victorie. As for this Christ, he had no heart to fight, But rather suffer wrong and lose his right. 6 The simple people thickly to him flockt, To see some workes of his, and heare him preach: Their ignorance he much abus'd, and mockt, The depth of his deceits they could not reach: Our learned Priests, and Rulers found him out, None claue to him, but of the vulgar rout. 7 With Publicanes and Sinners he conuerst, Did many workes vpon the Sabbath dayes: The Law of Moses he would haue reuerst, And led our Tribes into his crooked wayes: Though thus he did, yet some so sottish were, As to his new-found doctrine lend their eare. 8 It's true, he wrought some wonders now and then, That might be wrought by fauour of the Deuill: As curing lunatikes, and such like men Possest by spirits wicked, foule and euill. A holy man of God he could not bee, Whom he prouokt with open blasphemie, 9 Vaunting himselfe to be Gods onely Sonne, A fellow-partner in the Deitie, Equall with God: None since the world begun, Assum'd it to himselfe, but onely hee. Say, was not this a cursed childe of Cham, That lift himselfe 'boue father Abraham? 10 We saw him gasping yeild his latest breath, Others he holpe, himselfe he could not saue: His God-head like a man endured death, Now lyes his body senselesse in the graue. Then let vs see if he will rise to morrow, And rid his poore Disciples from their sorrow. 11 They mought (perhaps) by night haue stolne him thence, So drawne the people to a further error: But we haue set a watch for our defence, A guard to vs, and vnto them a terror. Let others talke their pleasure for a spurt, Dead men (say I) will neuer doe vs hurt. 12 Did we not well in dooming him to die, Who being poore, aspir'd vnto the Crowne? A mortall man, challeng'd diuinitie? 'Twas more then time to pull this fellow downe. Thus in the Temple as they walke, and jet, Each one the others saying doth abet. 13 These and such like discourses there they held, In triumph sang before the victorie: In malice swim'd, in pride lift-vp they swell'd, The end turn'd to their shame, and infamie. “So men that in their neighbours fall doe glorie, “Shall see him glad, when they themselues be sorie. 14 The heauinesse and mourning of the Disciples and other Belieuers.Meanewhile, the sad Disciples of our Lord, And holie Women, such as lou'd him liuing, Assembling in one place with ioynt accord, Consume their eyes with teares, their hearts with grieuing: They hang their heads, sighing one with another, As tender children robbed of their mother. 15 A Sabbath day 'twas, and a solemne feast, But all their mirth was turned into mourning: Their restlesse sorrowes yeilded them no rest, Cold feare seaz'd some, with zeale some harts were burning. All comfortlesse, none comforted his mate, Like men aston'd by Basiliskes they sate. 16 Some, first their owne faint-heartednesse accuse, Some, Pilat and the Romanes doe condemne: All ioyntly blame the Rulers of the Iewes, For murthring him who did no hurt to them. Not one remembred what Christ oft had said, To comfort them when they were most dismaid. 17 How hee was borne to suffer griefe and paine, As in the Psalmes and Prophets it is writ: To suffer death, yet soone to rise againe, Then mount to heau'n, and their in glorie sit. This lesson often taught them, they forgot, Or scarce belieu'd, or vnderstood it not. 18 Marke 16. 10.Thus that whole day, and all the night they spent, As mourners vse, for dearest friends departed: The men their clothes, their hayre the women rent, Sad in their faces, yet more sable-hearted. Early next morne before the breake of day, Some holy women hye themselues away. 19 Their errand was, the Sepulchre to see, The place, for loue of him that in it lay: To doe on Christ a worke of pietie, Their latest dutie to the dead to pay. Of sweet and costly spices they brought store, To doe't well once, which could be done no more. 20 Here was that blessed Mary Magdalen, Which in his life time did on him such cost: As made the Traitor Iudas to repine, And wretchedly complaine, that all was lost. Once more this holy Woman doth her best, To shew her zeale to Christ among the rest. 21 This was indeed a holy Pilgrimage, A pious Christian worke of pure deuotion: If all the Pilgrimes in this later age, Did ground their iournies on so good a motion: With slender errours men might well dispence, Nor at the ciuill custome take offence. 22 Here my deuotions, Lord I humbly tender, The Author prayeth briefly Vpon the Altar of a contrite heart: A sacrifice I offer, poore and slender, Yet such as thou acceptest in good part: The calues of lips prepared thee to praise, Hos. 14. 2. For thy great Grace, and mercies many waies. 23 But chiefly for thy precious Death and Passion, The meanes that frees vs from the Diuells thrall: Consummate by thy strange Resuscitation, The root of liuely hope in Christians all. 1. Pet. 1. 3. So make vs die to sinne, and liue to thee, That to good workes disposed we may bee. 24 Now marke the storie of the Resurrection, Each circumstance deserueth deepe attention: Let eares, and hearts with reuerent subiection, Yeild full assent. (it is no feyn'd inuention.) The truth in euery point appeares so plaine, To amplifie vpon it, were but vaine. 25 The womens comming to the Sepulchre. Matth. 28.When first the women came vnto the place, What formerly befell, the Text doth showe: A glorious Angell with bright-shining face, His garments whiter then the driuen snowe, Descending strangely made the earth to quake, For feare of whom, the armed watch-men shake. 26 A band of Romane souldiers well prouided, Were set to keepe the bodie from surprising: Their pollicies the Lord of Hosts derided, This guard confirmes our Sauiours powr'full rising. In their owne craft Iew-Statists were 'ore-reach't, Christs godhead more consum'd, which they impeacht. 27 A Simile or Comparison.“Ther's no disaster like i'th' warres to that, “As when a Chiefetaine, trusting by his wit, “To cheat his foe-man with a cunning plat, “Is catch't himselfe, and fowlely foyl'd in it. So here this subtle Iewish stratagem, Made more for Christ, and quite confounded them. 28 The watch amazed with that glorious vision, Dead stricken in a swound vpon the place, Reuiuing with some little intermission, Aduisedly bethinke them on the case: The fact was cleere, and not to be conceal'd, By vs (said they) 'twere best to be reueal'd. 29 It's like enough, as lately at the Passion, Classis 6. St. 189. The miracles there done, conuerted some: So, things here hap'ning in so strange a fashion, Caus'd many to the Christian Faith to come. Onely some of them posted to the Iewes, And freely op'ned to them all the newes. 30 Perhaps they told it to a fayre intent, Prick't in their hearts with such an heau'nly sight, Not well fore-casting what might be th' euent, Nor that the Priests informed of the right, Would offer to oppose a truth so cleere, But feele remorse when they thereof did heare. 31 Yet who could hope for any true compunction, I'th' hearts of Iewish Priests, in whom Christs warkes, When 'mongst them he discharg'd his holy function, Could not beget the smallest firie sparkes Of burning zeale to Truth, by him affirm'd, And fully out of holy writ confirm'd. 32 No, no: Those ghostly fathers soone assemble, The Priests corrupt the souldiers with money. With Elders, Scribes, and others of that rable: Against their knowledge falsely they dissemble, To blurre the truth, deuise an idle fable, That Christs Disciples closely thither crept, And stole him thence, the whilst the watchmen slept. 33 To gaine some credit to this truthlesse tale, The souldiers were entic't, and wonne with bribes, To set their faith and honestie at sale: (A shamelesse pranke of Priests, and learned Scribes) Those men of warre with large rewards thus hir'd, Consent to say as th' Elders had conspir'd. 34 Auarice. 1. Tim. 6.“Oh what a cursed crime is Auarice? “The root from whence springs many a damned deed: “A couetous man hath share in euery vice, “His money he adoreth in Gods stead. “His soule for money he consents to sell, “His Counting-house, is heau'n: the Church, his hell. 35 Twas money first made Iudas to deuize, Against his Lord, that plot of treacherie: Twas money made the Souldiers bolster lyes, Against the truth, and knowen veritie: The Deuill taught those Iewish Priests the skill, For crossing Christ, to worke their wretched will. 36 Strange was the cancred malice of these Iewes, Who rather then confesse their fault, and mend: Would yeild, themselues thus grossely to abuse, With all their race, eu'n to the later end. For as the Fathers taught the watch to say, So doe their children prattle at this day. 37 What hapned to the Women at the Sepulcre.But note what to those holy Women fell. The watchmen maz'd, halfe frighted of their wits: The Angell cheer'd, and vs'd the women well, Vpon the Tombe dore-stone he sweetly sits: Plucke vp your hearts, (saith he) be not afraid, Come see the place whereas the Lord was laid. 38 Hee's risen from the dead, as oft he told you, With speed to his Disciples make it knowne: Be strong in Faith, let no suspition hold you, Himselfe ere long in person will be showne: Him, you and they in Galile shall see, Loe what I speake, will sure fulfilled bee. 39 In feare and ioy they parted thence apace, To make relation of the Angels errant: Ere farre they were remoued from the place, (Their faith to strengthen by a further warrant) Vpon the way, their Lord directly meetes them, And with a gratious salutation greetes them. 40 Assoone as they beheld him with their eyes, Amazed at the strangenesse of the thing: To free their hearts from doubt of phantasies, Straight with their hands to feele him they begin: Yet humbly as for such a Lord was meet, Pressing to touch him onely by the feet. Matth. 28. 9. 41 Those feet, for which a Bath as salt as bryne, Blest Magdalen prepared at a dinner, With teares distilling from her blubbred eyne: (Now holy Woman, Once a noted sinner.) Luke 7. 39. Kissing them with her lips incessantly, And wip't them with her haire, till they were dry. 42 Those feete, which lately nayled to the tree, Gaue drops of bloud, all pretious baulmes excelling To cure the wounded soules of thee and mee, And purchase pardon for our foule rebelling Against heau'ns King: which none else could haue done. But onely hee, Gods sole begotten Sonne. 43 With reuerence they coupled adoration, Now well assur'd of his diuinitie: On him they fixe the hope of their saluation, Who ouer death and hell, gat victorie. Blest Women-Saints, selected first to see Their Sauiour, in his state of Maiestie. 44 Hath not God chosen things of small esteeme, 1. Cor. 1. 27.And foolish in appearance, to confound Such as in th' eyes of worldlings glorious seeme? Examples daily prouing this, abound. Christs birth to simple shepheards first made knowne, His Resurrection first to women showne. 45 He comforts them, as th' Angell late had done: Take courage now, there is no cause of feare: Iob. 20. 17.Vnto my brethren (O sweet words!) goe runne, Tell them the truth of all that's hap'ned here. Command them hasten into Galilee, For there my selfe in person shall they see. 46 Iob. 20.Next witnesses are Peter, and Saint Iohn, Who prickt with zeale vpon the first relation, With all their might vnto the place they ran. To testifie their holy emulation. Shrowd-clothes within the Sepulchre they find, The bodie gone, those onely left behind. 47 Verse 10.The sight whereof begets in them beliefe, Remembring then what Scriptures did containe: That he must suffer death, opprest with griefe, Yet triumph ouer death, and rise againe. Thus setled in their faith, home they returne Repleat with ioy, and cease thenceforth to mourne. 48 Luke 24. 13. and Mar. 16. 12Twice more he shew'd himselfe that very day, Desirous soone to put them out of feare. As two of them to Emaus held their way, In shape (at first) vnknowne he did appeare. By Scriptures prouing how it ought to bee, And breaking bread, They saw that it was hee. 49 Whereas before they rested in dispaire, (Their wordes to Christ himselfe imply no lesse) Luk. 24. 21. Note it. Ere he was dead (forsooth) their hopes were faire He should haue saued them: (so they confesse) Inferring thus, since he was dead and slaine, That now their further hope in him was vaine. 50 “An error deeply rooted in the heart, “Requires great paine and skill to moue it thence. Christ to his Schollers often did impart, A doctrine whereat still they tooke offence: He preacht of suffrings, persecutions, crosses, Yet they corrupt the Text with carnall glosses. 51 Their Christ must be a pow'rfull earthly King, The Priests and Scribes therein at first misse-led them: We find them alwayes harping on that string, With such grosse food their fleshly motions fed them: But when he rose from death, and shew'd his glorie, Then they beleeu'd aright the sacred storie. 52 Thus yeildeth he to their infirmities, Nor leaues them till in faith he makes them sound: To all their senses he himselfe applyes, That in the end with him they might be crown'd, And of their precious faith receaue the pay, 1. Pet. 1. 9. Their soules saluation at the later day. 53 That euening when they altogether met, For feare of Iewes within a priuate place: Eu'n in the midst of them where they were set, When doores were shut, he stands before their face: Salutes them, shewes his hands, and pierced side, Wherewith all present there were satisfi'de. 54 That day, three times, at Morning, Noone, and Euen, Himselfe he offred to be seene, and felt. Could any fairer proofe then this be giuen? For our behoofe the Lord thus freely dealt. And so he made his deare Disciples glad, Who euer since his Passion had beene sad. 55 Th' Apostle Thomas absent in that season, Informed by his fellowes of the troth, Would not beleeue a thing so farre past reason, Vnlesse by seeing, and by feeling both The nayled hands, and gored feet and side, With fingers thrust therein, it might be tride. 56 Hereby the Truth receau'd more confirmation, Christ yeilding to our imbecilitie: Iob. 20. 26.Some eight dayes after in the selfe same fashion, (Thomas then sitting in their companie) Comes in among them, bids him see, and feele him: Who forthwith for his Lord and God doth style him. 57 No sooner had Saint Thomas so confest, The Lord his faiths confession did accept: Yet with more emphasis pronounc't them blest, In whom true faith should worke as full effect, Though him in person they had neuer seene, Nor euer with him conuersant had beene. 58 A gracious, sweet, and heau'nly consolation, To all who firmely with a stedfast faith, Embrace The Word which guides vs to saluation, And freely yeild assent to what Christ saith. Rom. 30.Our faith by hearing comes, and not by sight; Is fruitfull in good workes, if it be right. 59 More signes and tokens yet then these, were wrought, For full assurance of the Resurrection: To write them all, it was not needfull thought, Th' Euangelists had not their owne election, But wholly guided by the holy Sprite, As much as was expedient, did write. 60 It's written, how he asked of them meate, They gaue him honey-combe, and broyled fish: Then in their presence he thereof did eate, And forthwith quits them with a better dish; A heauenly food, their hungrie soules to cherish; Who soundly feedes thereon, shall neuer perish. 61 The wordes which he before his Passion told them, He freshly calls vnto their memorie: That fast in minde they afterwards might hold them, The substance of the sacred Historie Concerning Him, his Passion, and his Rising, To cause them stand on Faith, not on surmizing. 62 Their wits were dull, and slow of apprehension, Which he vouchsaft by grace so to enlighten, As that to th' holy Text they gaue attention, And so their former errors all, doe righten; Fully confirm'd in this point of their Creed, Their mindes from doubts and scruples wholly freed, 63 Most grosse had been their incredulitie, If seeing proofes farre cleerer then the Sunne, All jumping with the sacred Historie, With vnbeleeuing Rabbins they had runne, Shutting their eyes through malice, or of spite, And louing darknesse rather then the light. 64 Yet for their better satisfaction, 1. Cor. 15.Fiue hundred men and more in open viewe, All at one time were witnesse to the action: What needed more to proue the storie true? Where two or three confirme a thing by oath, 'Mongst honest men it's taken for a troth. 65 Let Infidels blasphemously deride, And scorne this doctrine of the Resurrection; The storie here so cleerly iustifi'de, Affoords to all, but Atheists, satisfaction: “Yet faith, though furthred by such helps as these, “Is Gods free gift, bestow'd where he doth please. 66 The 'article of our Creede touching the Resurrection, by Christ proued; and Sadduces confuted. Matt. 22.The Sadduces, in sooth meere Epicures, Who in this life plac't all felicitie, Deuoted wholly to their worldly pleasures, Suppos'd the soule did with the body die: They prest our Sauiour with a weake obiection, Intending to confute the Resurrection. 67 Of all the cauills vs'd against our Lord, By Iewes or Gentiles to oppose the Truth, (Whereof the sacred Writers make record) There's none so fond as this which here ensu'th: By grosse conceiting in that blessed life, A carnall coupling of the Man, and Wife. 68 In Socrates, or Platoes heathen schooles, Had these men such a sottish question mou'd, I ghesse they had beene hissed out for fooles, No answere to so fond a iest behou'd. Vers. 33. 34.Yet he by Scriptures doth them so confute, That others wonder, and themselues stand mute. 69 You erre (saith he) through Scriptures ignorance: (Of errors all in faith, the chiefest ground.) For, Saints possessing heauens inheritance, To marriage Rites and duties are not bound: But Angell-like doe liue in full perfection, To carnall Lawes no longer in subiection. 70 Of Abr'ham, Isak, and of Israel I am the God. (Saith God who liues for aye.) Is he a God of dead, or liuing? Tell. The men were dumbe, and had no more to say. A shallow question answer'd most profoundly, The Resurrection thence confirmed soundly. 71 By sundrie places of the elder Writ, The generall resurrection further proued and described out of Scriptures. Psal. 16. 2. Hos. 6. 2. 1. Cor. 15. 20. The Resurrection plainly taught wee see: Dauid the King directly points at it, So doe some Prophets else aswell as hee. These properly relate to Christ our Head, Whom Scriptures call, the first fruits of the dead. 72 As hee is first, and sanctifies the rest, So shall the members with their head partake: If Christ his resurrection bee confest, For rising of our bodies, it doth make. We must acknowledge both, or both denie: For Scriptures both alike doe iustifie. 73 Good Iob, a righteous man of speciall note, Most cleerly of this point did prophecie: Iob. 19. 25. His Creed in this behalfe he plainly wrote, That in his flesh, and with that very eye, He should see God, through his Almightie powre, Though wormes his earthly carkasse did deuowre. 74 2. Mac. 7.Such was the hope of those renowned Iewes, Whose constancie deserueth admiration, Whom shamefully Antiochus did vse, And vrge them to haue done abomination: Vers. 9.With ioy they suffred death in bitter paine, Assur'd that God would rayse them vp againe. 75 What giues men courage in a cause that's good, Expose their persons freely to all dangers: For King and Countries sake to spend their bloud, Heb. 11.Vpon this earth accompt themselues as strangers: But full assurance of those future ioyes, Whereto all earths delights compar'd, are toyes? 76 Yea some, in life and manners most prophane, Who seeme to care for neither God, nor Deuils: With sodaine terrors often-times are tane, Their conscience them accusing of their euils: Confounded in their hearts, are forc't to tremble, Vnable longer closely to dissemble. 77 Eze. 37.Marke how an heape of bones dry'de-vp, and withred, With flesh and sinewes clothed were of new: In troupe like armed men on sodaine gathred, To shadow-out what lastly shall ensue, When as th' Arch-Angels trumpet shrill will sound, Reuel. 20. 13.The Sea yeild vp her dead, and so the ground. 78 3. Esa. 2. 42.A noble Iewish Scribe, a man of fame, Belou'd of God, of Kings a fauorite: Reueal'd to him in vision sawe the same; And for our comfort in his Booke doth write, The Resurrection full of state, and glorie, Obserue that parcell of his worthy storie. 79 A people numberlesse stood on Mount Sion, Praysing the Lord of heau'n in Psalmes, and Hymnes: One taller then the rest (as 'twere a Lion 'Mong lesser beasts) much fairer in his limmes, Put crownes vpon their heads, palmes in their hands, Whereat this holy man amazed stands. 80 An Angell tells him, these men mortall were, Now are they cloth'd with immortalitie: The Sonne of God is he whom thou seest there, Which giues them crownes, and palmes for victorie: Sith they his name once manfully confest, Now in his Kingdome he esteemes them blest. 81 So in another place he giues vs warning, Chap. 14. 34 Our hearts and vnderstanding to reforme: (A godly lesson, short, and worth the learning) That after death we may escape the storme, Which downe to hell all wicked men will driue: For good and bad, must after death reuiue. 82 The Sonne of Amos, Prophet most diuine, Esay 26. 19. None spake of things to come more plaine then hee. As if they had beene set before his eyne: Hee sayes, that dead to life restor'd shall bee. Awake yee that in dust now lye, and sing: For as the watred herb, so shall you spring. 83 To thee sweet louely Daniel was reueal'd This mysterie, most needfull to be knowne: Thou laidst ope that, when others close were seal'd, This doctrine in our eares by thee is blowne: Dan. 12. 3. That such as sleepe in dust, shall yet awake, Some in great glorie, some in shame partake. 84 Note the vanitie of worldlings and Epicures described. Wisd. 2.Well doth the wise King, wicked men vpbrayd, Their sottishnesse and foolerie deride: Who with the shortnesse of this life dismayd, And thinking on none other like beside; Exhort each other here whilst they haue leasure, To spend their dayes in vanitie, and pleasure. 85 Edamus &amp; Bibamus, cras moriemur. 1. Cor. 15.Our time (say they) is short, and full of care, There's no returning backward from the graue: Our breath is as a smoake, or subtle aire, A small assurance of our life we haue: Our bodies breathlesse made, will soone be rotten, We and our names be sodenly forgotten. 86 Come on, let vs enioy the present time, Let's frolike freely in our ages spring: Anoint our selues with costly oile, quaffe wine, Refresh our hearts with each delightfull thing. Let's leaue some tokens to posteritie, Of our voluptuous sports, and jollitie. 87 Let's grinde the poore, the widdow, and the iust, Our will (when we haue pow'r) esteeme for Law: Looze all the reynes of libertie t'our lust: What need we of our Elders stand in awe? From mirth and pleasures they seeke to restraine vs, In crabbed wayes of vertue they would traine vs. 88 Their ends to ours are meerly opposite, The wayes which we walke in, to them are grieuous: They thinke we all run wrong, themselues goe right, Of youthfull sports they studie to bereaue vs: They call themselues Gods children: let vs proue, What good in fine betides them by his loue. 89 These be the doctrines of the damned crew, Whom scornefully the Wise-man reprehendeth: From Epicures those principles they drew, Their life and precepts hereto solely tendeth, The Resurrection flatly to denie, Thinke soules and bodies both together die. 90 But when in Hell these wretches feele their torment, Wisd. 3. Feare and amazement will their soules oppresse: Then all too late they shall begin repent, Their former error, vrg'd with griefe, confesse. Beholding blessed Saints, whom once they scorn'd, Sitting on seates, with glorious crownes adorn'd. 91 Loe, these be they whom whilom we derided, Their vertuous life, we reck'ned to be madnesse: Now God for them hath graciously prouided, Conuerted all their mourning into gladnesse. Woe worth the time, when we so grossely err'd, And our amendment totally deferr'd. 92 Would cursed Atheists, and loose Libertines (Of whom so many in these dayes abound) Oft ruminate and thinke on this by times, If in this point of Creed, their faith were sound, That soules and bodies in the Iudgement day, Shall both be ioyn'd, and ioyntly haue their pay: 93 (As friends or linked mates that mischiefe plot, A Simile. In felonie, or treason doe conspire; Conuicted of the crime, haue both one lot, Offending both alike, receaue like hire: Like fault, like forfeit Iustice doth decree, Shee's blinde, and neuer can the parties see.) 94 Then would not vice and lewdnesse be so rife, Nor plaine and honest dealing laid aside: More faith and loue would be t'wixt man and wife, Lesse surfetting in riot, and lesse pride. For either hope of heau'n, or feare of hell, Would force such as beleeue them, to liue well. 95 More proofes of the resurrection. By Christ, and his Apostles, and others.This Article ought not so strange to seeme, If former things with future we compare: Wee reade, some dead restor'd to life haue beene, Admit examples in this case be rare; Yet if some haue beene so, why may not more? And all in th' end, as well as few before? 96 1. Cor. 15. 19.If good men in this life alone haue hope, Aboue all else most wretched were their state: Gods Iustice therefore seemes to haue this scope, Both good and bad, once to remunerate. Luke 16. 25.Some here, with all delights haue full refection, Some others find it in the resurrection. 97 No man confessing God, doubts of his pow're. As all things by his Word, of nought were made; So all againe in minute of an hou're, At will he can consume, and cause them fade: That thing which once was, he can soone restore, As well as make it, when 'twas not afore. 98 The seed which plow'men burie in the earth, As doe our bodies in the graue, so dyes it: But dying, it receiues an other birth, Which death adornes it more, and dignifies it. So shall our bodies rise the very same, But much more glorious, and with greater fame. 99 Not as at first, their substance corruptible, But in a perfect state of incorruption: Not as at first, vile, base, and contemptible, But qualifi'de to honour, and promotion: Not weake, nor outward helpes (as lately) needing, But sprit-like, wanting neither clothes, nor feeding. 100 Had Adam in his innocence remain'd, He should haue lacked much of that perfection, Which God out of his goodnesse hath ordain'd, For Saints made glorious in the Resurrection: Though Epicures and damned Atheists scoffe it. Men fearing God, are most assured of it. 101 The members shall be like vnto their head, Our bodies chang'd, and fashion'd like to his: Phil. 3. 21. Not to returne againe where they were bred, But ioyn'd vnto their soules, to liue in blisse. As he vp to the heauens did ascend, All that be his, with him must thither wend. 102 What bootes it him, who combats for a crowne, A Comparison. His Riuall slaine, himselfe to lie in durance? If hauing wonne the field, hee's still kept downe, Of state and life enioying small assurance? Our Combatant o'recomming, takes the Crowne: Enioyes the Kingdome solely as his owne. 103 By rising from the dead, he death subdude, Else by his Passion nothing could we gaine: Yf still in graue his body had beene mew'd, Our faith and hope in him, had all beene vaine. But death he swallow'd vp in victorie, Es. 25. 8. As was foreshew'd vs by sure prophecie. 104 Act. 1. 3. Luke 24. 50.His resurrection prou'd so many wayes, By signes and tokens not to be denide, He liu'd among th' Apostles fortie dayes, Then taking them to Bethanie aside, The Ascension of our Sauior.He there bestow'd his blessing on th' eleuen, And in their sight was carried vp to heauen. 105 A Simile.As when a father tendring in his heart, His children bred-vp euer in his sight: Enforc't from them in th' instant to depart, Bequeathes them for a farewell all his right In what he hath, which may be for their good; Iust so the case with Christs Apostles stood. 106 So they like Orphanes of a louing Sire, By some surprisall sodenly bereft. To manifest their loue and hearts desire, Stand gazing all amaz'd, as if by theft They had beene robd: Their eyes full fixt are bent, The way through which that pretious bootie went. 107 Two holy Angels sodenly appeare Attir'd in white; (a badge of innocence) Ye men (quoth they) why stand you gazing here? This Iesus who from you is taken hence, In sort as you haue seene him vp ascend, So shall he come againe in the worlds end. 108 Ps. 68. and Eph. 4And thus triumphant mounting vp on hie, (As long before the sacred Psalmist chaunted) Captiue with him he led Captiuitie, His foe men all were put to flight, and daunted. The Deuill, Death and Hell with all their traines, Like captiues fettred fast in Iron chaines. 109 No Romane in the highest of their state, So iustly triumpht on their conqu'red foes. They eftsoones lost, what formerly they gate, What Christ once wonne, he neuer more can lose. His seruants from those Tyrants he set free, Restor'd them to perpetuall libertie. 110 Now sits he seated in his heauenly Throne, Millions of Angells waiting at his becke: His foes to punish, to protect his owne, To cherish these, but giue to those a checke. All pow're is his in earth, and so in heauen, Matth. 28. 18. Both in his right, and by his father giuen. 111 By lawfull conquest he this honour wonne, Exhortations to suffer afflictions with Christ. Reu. 2. 10. His life a warfare was, so should ours bee: His souldiers must go on, as he begonne, Perseuer to the death, and neuer flee. For those a Crowne of glorie he prepar'd: Such seruitors are sure of their reward. 112 Christ as a King sits on a high Theater. A Comparison. His men of Warre march alwayes in his sight: To know their valours he needs no Relater, But sees who turnes his backe, and who doth fight. Perseuerance makes men with him accepted, Back-sliders from his presence are reiected. 113 Who can behold his Sou'raigne without blushing, Another Comparison. That placed at a breach to make defence: When th' enemie runs fiercely thither rushing, Then he for feare of danger flyeth thence? Rom. 8. 18. No place shall he haue in the Church Triumphant, That proues false hearted in the Militant. 114 Hath not our Chiefetaine brauely led the way? His sole example may suffice to moue vs. Sith he commandeth ought not we obey? It's for our good that he is pleas'd to proue vs. 2. Cor. 12. 8. 9.His seruants whom he tries, he keepes from falling, His Grace confirmes them surer in their calling. 115 All suffrings in this life, and all oppressings, How great soe're they seeme to flesh and bloud: Are but flea-bitings to those great rich blessings, (If they by vs were rightly vnderstood) Which he hoords vp, and keepes for vs in store, So we walke on, as he hath done before. 116 A Simile.Who would not gladly with his Prince partake, In deepest dangers of the sharpest warres: Expose himselfe to perills for his sake, His bodie load with wounds, his face with scarres: Assur'd in fine the victorie to gaine, Rom. 8. 17.And fellow-heire with him in state to raigne. 117 Heb. 12.“Those Sonnes whom Fathers loue, they most correct: “And chastic'd children loue their parents best: “Our sonnes whom least we loue, we most neglect, “Best Souldiers to the hard'st assaults are prest. “A Generall makes like account of dastards, “As most reputed fathers doe of bastards. 118 Act. 14 23.In at heau'ns Gate no entrance can be found, But onely thorow many tribulations: The Saints that now liue there in glorie crown'd, Good men, and vertuous in their generations, From trialls and afflictions were not free. And if not they, then tell me why should wee? 119 What man is he that combats for a Crowne, Aimile. But bends his thoughts directly to the prize? When in the lists he once hath set him downe, No dangers doe appeare before his eyes: All hazards seeme but strawes cast in his way, He neuer lookes on them, but at the prey. 120 Looke to our Faiths first Author and Perfector: Heb. 12. The hope of ioy, made him despise all shame, Endure the Crosse: (therein hee's our director.) Wee must, as he did, striue for that best game. (What gaines the man who all the world should win, Matth. 16. 24. And lose his soule to Satan by his sin?) 121 Examples each-wherein Gods booke abound, With precepts many thereunto exciting: Among the ancient Hebrewes may be found Heb. 11. and 12 A Catalogue, against Afflictions fighting: A cloud of Witnesses for imitation, To make vs partners with them in saluation. 122 With sundry sorts of torments they were frighted, To change their Faith, and alter their Profession: In midst thereof, it seemes they were delighted, Chap 12. 35. Refusing when 'twas offered them, remission: Of bitter crosses making their election, In hope to find a better resurrection. 123 With scornefull taunts and ieastings some were mock't, Made gazing-stocks for men at them to wonder: Impris'ned, then their braines with stones out-knock't, And others in their middles saw'd asunder: With fire and sword were put to execution, By cursed Caitiffes full of all pollution. 124 Some walk't about in skins of goates and sheepe, Of worldly comfort wholly destitute: In mountaines, dennes, and hollow caues did keepe, Assur'd by faith, that God would retribute, Rewarding those who wrongfully did suffer, And plaguing them that iniuries doe offer. 125 Of Christian Martyrs stranger things are told, Whilst Romane heathnish Tyrants proudly swaid That crushing Scepter: Each sort young and old, The ancient Matrone, and the tender Maid, Endured all that tyrants could inuent, Yet taking comfort in their punishment. 126 Of Christs comming to Iudgement in his glorie. 2. Pet. 3.They knew their Lord in glorie would returne, That th' heau'ns which are (like smoke) should passe away: That th' earth with all the workes therein must burne, At his appearance in the later day: A better place for them was kept in store, Where they should taste of paine and griefe no more. 127 Mala. 4.That wicked men which did them vexe and trouble, Puft-vp in pride, against Gods people swelling: In that great Day shall be consum'd like stubble, And euermore in Hell to haue their dwelling: To weepe and gnash their teeth through cold and heat: To freeze, yet frying grieuously to sweat. 128 Reu. 6. and Math. 24. 36. That Day at vnawares shall ouer-take them, As in the time when Noah built the Arke: Then sodaine feare and dread shall sorely shake them, They'll seeke to hide in caues, and corners darke; Desire the rocks and mountaines them to couer. There from the Iudges face vnseene to houer. 129 But none out of his presence may abide All eyes must needes behold, and on him looke, Reu. 1. 7. Yea th' eyes of him who pierc't his pretious side: Each one shall haue his iudgement by a booke, His Conscience wherein his deeds are writ, The same must him condemne, or else acquit. 130 How can a worldling wallowing in his vice, Addicted all to sensualitie, Making this Earth his onely Paradise, Who neuer did one deed of pietie Thinke on that day, and not resolue t'amend, Or in dispaire, his wretched life to end? 131 Their wicked workes in order shall be cited, Matth. 25. 41. What ill they did, what good they left vndone: Thus standing of those crimes at barre indited, The sentence of the Iudge they'll seeke to shunne: But proofes against them pregnant will appeare, So then their finall Iudgement they shall heare. 132 Goe hence ye cursed to eternall fire, The heauy sentence against the damned, at the last Iudgement. For damned diuells, and their Angels kindled: With them for euer to receaue your hyre. Thus in a moment out they shall be singled, Thrust downe into the pit of endlesse paine, From whence all hope of comming out is vaine. 133 Who hath beene present at Assize or Sessions, A Comparison. With heed vpon the pris'ners cast his eyes: Men charged with grosse crimes, and fowle oppressions, With treasons, murthers, thefts, and robberies: All capitall offences by iust rigour, If countries lawes be left to haue their vigour. 134 To one, the Prince himselfe a pardon brings, Leaues others to the Iustice of the Land: Note how that one cheeres vp himselfe and sings, The rest all heartlesse like dumbe Idols stand. Yet much more horrour shall possesse their heart, Who from that barre must downe to hell depart. 135 Ther Atheists with Idolaters shall meet. Loose Libertines and Epicures ioyne hands: Arch-heretickes each other sowrly greet, All linked fast in Iron chaines and bands: The thought whereof would driue to desperation, Men lacking helpes of ghostly consolation. 136 Ther's then no time of pardon, or of grace, 'Twil be too late to thinke vpon repenting: Mercie is fled, and Iustice come in place, The Iudge implacable without relenting. Fierce fiends, the Iaylers, 'pointed to torment, On rigour with extremitie all bent. 137 A two-fold punishment augments their anguish, Pœna sensus. Pœna damni.The sense of hellish paines, is but the least: Losse of heau'ns ioyes constraines them fret and languish, Hereby their torments chiefly are encreas't. Their enuie at the others blessed state, Makes them both God, and all his Saints to hate. 138 The ioyfull and comfortable speech of our Sauiour to the Elect, at that day.Then shall the godly triumph and reioyce, Beholding Christ their Lord in Maiestie: Encourag'd with that comfortable voyce, Wherewith lowd in their hearing he will cry, Come blessed Children of my heauenly father, All you into my Kingdome I will gather. 139 For you it was prepared long agoe, A gift of God, no purchase of your owne: Like gracious children you haue liued so, Such workes of mercie on my members showne, That now your vertuous deeds shalbe rewarded, Your selues from Satans clawes securely guarded, 140 One cup of water for my sake bestow'd, Mat. 9. 41. (A gift of slender value in its kind.) If that from faith and charitie it flow'd, Shall neuer faile a recompence to find. To clothe the naked, hungry folke to feed, Are workes for which the donour hath his meed. 141 Come fellow-heires, the Crowne with me inherit: (For you with my heart-bloud I dearly bought it.) Receaue it as my gift, not as your merit; Rom. 6. 23. 'Twas offred all, but godlesse men ne're sought it. Come you my Sheepe, here by my right side stand, Let Goates withdraw themselues to the left hand. 142 You good and faithfull seruants enter in, Matth. 25. Be partners with your Master in his pleasures: Sith you in smaller things haue trustie beene, I set before you all my heauenly treasures: Take euery one as much as may content you, Your fulnesse onely, nothing else, shall stint you. 143 Though some haue had fiue talents, some but twaine, And like good Stewards frugally imploy'd them: Sith either sort haue vs'd them to my gaine, Not closely for their owne behoofe enioy'd them: Both haue their hire, yet not in equall ranke, Such as best doe, the better is their thanke. 144 Kings, Princes, Prophets, Prelates, Magistrates, Who had your places high aboue the rest: Chiefe men in Church, in Kingdomes, and in States, Who in your seu'rall callings did your best. More then the lesser Starres your light shall shine, Your seates be placed neerer vnto mine. 145 You nursing Fathers to the Church my Spowse, Her childrens Patrones, and he Faiths Defenders: You that (when Tyrants rag'd, and bent their browes) Maintayn'd her Rights against all false Pretenders: You must excell in her triumphant state, As in her militant you did of late. 146 The Authour to his Patrone.(Loe you (Great Prince) ioynt with your Royall Sire, Partaker in these heau'nly benedictions, Ought boldly to goe on, and not retire: Though passing thorough manifold afflictions, Maintayne Gods Cause, then God will you defend, And richly recompence you in the end.) 147 You painfull Pastors, Preachers of Gods Word, Who in my warfare stoutly did aduenter, Heb. 4 12. Reuel. 19. 15.Still fighting with that sharpe-two-edged Sword, Which through the soule and spright doth quickly enter, Whose chiefe endeuour was, mens soules to winne, To set vp vertue, and to beat downe sinne: 148 Whose liues and doctrine fairely did agree, Who practis'd that your selues, which you taught others: Whose faith brought forth good fruits aboundantly, Who liu'd in loue and concord with your brothers: Among the blessed Angels rest you heere, Belou'd of mee, and vnto them most deere. 149 Come all at once that did True Faith embrace, Whose shining workes redounded to my glorie: Matth. 5. 16. Now in my heau'nly Kingdome take your place, Where you shall ioy, and neuer more be sorie. The battell's ended, all our foes cast downe, 2. Tim. 4. 7. 8. Of euerlasting life enioy the Crowne. 150 Thus on a loftie Theame in lowly straine, The Authour concludeth, and craueth pardon for his lowly stile, vpon so loftie a subiect. A silly Shepherd countrie Carolls sings: A subiect fitter for a purer braine, Or for a Muse borne-vp with nimbler wings. Ours waxen beene: so fearing they would frie, Shee keepes below, and durst not soare too hie. 151 High mysteries (whereof this Theame hath store) With reuerence and silence shee omitteth: Singing of what shee knowes, and of no more, Her Rimes vnto her vnderstanding fitteth. Affects to be perspicuous and plaine, Shunning of purpose an heroike vaine. FINIS. Soli Deo Trino &amp; Vni, Omnis laus, honor, &amp; gloria in aternum. An Epitaph for the happy memorie of our late Renowmed Soueraigne, King Iames. To his Royall Sonne, our dread LIEGE LORD, King Charles. Oft haue we heard an old-said-saw, Voucht by great Masters of the Law, As a cleere case: The King ne're dyes. What then meane all these watrie eyes? These sable sutes? These heauie lookes? Th' example ouer-rules their bookes. For Iames, of late the Kingdomes Head, (Liuing the body) here lyes dead. Why? headlesse bodies haue no life! To solue this doubt, and end the strife: Know, Kings doe onely change the name, The Stile and State remayne the same. For, iust as King Iacobvs dy'de, God saue King Charles, the people cry'de. So soone as th' one breath'd-out his last, The Crowne on th' others head was cast. Then, as the Law sayes, so say I, (Conceaue it right.) Kings neuer die. In other sense it may bee sed Of good King Iames, hee's not yet dead, The while that Royall Charles here liues, Life to renowmed Iames hee giues. Of whom hee first receau'd his breath, Him now hee vindicates from death. Thrice happy Sire in such a Son, A Dauid after a Solomon: Both, in his Person, fast combin'd, With gifts of Body, and of Mind. I iudge the World a body fit, On which so braue a Head should sit. Thou little World, Great Britaine, sing: That Art made blest with such a King. Now faithfull Subjects ceasse your mourning, Your Sorrowes into Prayers turning: That they in their Posteritie, May alwayes liue, and neuer die: But sway the Scepter of these Lands, Which God hath put into their hands. So prayeth Your Maiesties zealously deuoted Beadsman, Ioh. Stradling.</field>
