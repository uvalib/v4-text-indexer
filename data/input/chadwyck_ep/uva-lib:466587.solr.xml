      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME THE FIRST, VOLUME THE SECOND FALL OF CAMBRIA. BOOK I. SCENE, Edward and his Army approaching Chester. Of Cambria and her valiant sons, subdued By the first Edward, England's Lord, I sing. The bright red clouds were gathering in the west, As Edward, pride of the Plantagenet, With earnest step, and purpose resolute, Toward Cambria's realm urged on his veteran bands. In all the pomp of war, as thus they march, Seeking renown, the King, with cheering smile, Pauses, and, with a backward glance, surveys, Along the vale, pennons and plumes draw near, With glittering helmets; and, upon the hills, Far distant, still, the warrior multitude, Till the dim object, fading, died away. Nor did not, in that hour, hope rising high Swell Edward's heart, when he, so brave a host, Impatient for the combat, saw advance, Himself impatient;âheroes, clad in mail, The waving banner, casque and hawberk bright, Catching the radiance of the setting sun; Joy, not sedate, was his, when to the fight, Seeking Llewellyn, (his perpetual foe The scourge of England) such a force he led, Anticipating glory, and the fruit Of that campaign, which promised, in its range Of future blessings, concord permanent 'Tween rival nations, and, for him, the meed Of ever-during fame! The evening star Faintly shone forth, as in th' horizon peer'd, Fronting their path, Chester's tall battlements. Far off they rose, a cumbrous mass of shade, Harmonious, in the beam of lingering day, Which, in long lines of light, 'tween heaven and earth, A glowing vista gave, dark clouds above, With Nature's undistinguish'd forms beneath; Whilst, in the region of the sky's calm verge, Still beauteous in decay'd magnificence, The summer lightning, at long intervals, Burst harmless on the sight. The lofty towers, (To which they hasten'd with a traveller's joy Who spies his home at last, after long toil) Now stand more manifest; the embrasured wall, The thin black aperture, the buttress huge, Increasing momently, whilst at each flash, Which half disclosed the sapphire gates of heaven, The castle rose, in radiant majesty, Than crystal clearer, then, a little space, Plunged into night, 'till o'er the canopy Again the white glare burst. Nearer they draw; When, from the crowded ramparts, a loud shout, Triumphant, fill'd the air, friend greeting friend, Which, Eve, from drowsy listlessness, aroused Into keen vigilance, whilst Echo sent Loud answers, from her wood-crown'd mountains round. To end their toil, the antique arch they reach, Dark and austere, whilst the barred windows, high, Half hid in green, now throng'd with multitudes, Uproar send forth. Entering, with hasty step, New friends receive them: these with eager joy And exultation, hail, at Chester's walls, (Bent on new enterprize) their gallant prince, So famed o'er Palestine, yea, to the verge Of Indus, whilst Old Nile, flowing serene, Down from his Libyan sands, spread as he flow'd Th' achievements, by the English Hero wrought, When the proud Soldan fled before the Cross. Ere food relieved nature's long abstinence, Or rest restored the weary, firm of heart, Barons and knights, clad in their iron coats, Around their Royal Leader eager crowd; And all is still. No common scene was there, Nor common spirit. Torches, burning bright, Beam'd on the shining gorget, and the lance, And burnish'd helm, and marshall'd cuirass, ranged Round the huge walls:âhabiliments revered Of potent chieftains, men, in elder days, For prowess famed, and chivalrous exploit, Who, in their country's cause, fell nobly, here, A sacred trust, preserved, to animate What future race, England, in hour of need, Rejoicing in her confidence, might call Her guardian heroes. The Baronial Hall, Thus sanctified by reverence of the great, Fill'd with the blazing torch, thick scatter'd round, Now shone resplendent. Every breathing chief, From his broad chest, heaving the glittering mail, The brightness wider spread; a dancing host Of ever-changing and commingled lights, Thro' which the armour of departed earls, And puissant knights, and squires of high renown, Sent their calm steady beam: e'en like the towers, 'Mid the Ãgean (that, with friendly blaze Warn the lone mariner, midnight around, And storms appalling,) when, upon the waves, The bright ray wantons, while the distant lamps Amid the tumult, the wide-dancing glare, Hold stedfast out, their calm effulgency. Silent, and solemnized by all around, Waiting some fresh disclosure of the war, The valiant chiefs, defiance in their eye, Now stand expectant. 'Bove his bold compeers, Edward, the lion on his spangled helm, August, appear'd. A manly front was his, Scarred in the warfare, yet, with lineament, And eye, imperial; ensigns of a mind, By more than fortune raised to eminence, Where virtue reign'd and high-born purposes. Whilst the tower bell, 'mid the still watch of night, Upon the wind, his solemn tale sent forth, Which at that hour, momentous, seem'd to strike Each heart, tho' fearless, with mysterious awe, The King, his hand upraising, thus began. âWarriors! whose deeds the song hath told, whose name âEven Lisping Innocence (taught by the sounds âGrateful and most familiar) utters forth, âIn its first dawn of languageâat this hour, âI hail you, dear to England and to Fame. âTho' to earth's farthest verge, your feats are known, âAnd you your country's character have deck'd âIn honorable garb, and sent it forth âEmbalmed and fragrant, other path remains âFruitful of glory. To confirm your praise, âIndelibly, I lead you to achieve âOne towering deed and arduous, which perform'd, âHonor is your's and permanent renown. âHear me, O Chiefs! let not one accent fail. âEurope, throughout her hundred warrior realms, âWith the bold Saracen, the Christian's shame, âAnd Afric's hostsâthese our victorious spears âHave taught to tremble! yet, within our land, âA people lives, a contumacious prince, âFalse, furious, and intractable, whose lance âDefies a hostile world, and whom our sires, âGreat as they were and valiant, oft in vain âEssay'd to conquer. Insults unprovoked, âWrongs numberless, too long hath England borne âFrom this vindictive man, this faithless race. âScarce hath the summer sun, thrice o'er our land âScatter'd profusion, since the Cambrian swore âTo sheath the sword; repress the robber band; âTreaties respect, and our strong fortresses âTo honor, where the desolated March âMarks the strong bound'ry: well, the Cambrian faith, âO Chiefs, you know! Have not our bravest towers, âOur firmest castles, fall'n, before the rage âOf fierce Llewellynâwhom no law can bind, âAnd whose replenish'd strength from darkness springs, âWe know not whence, to stigmatize our sword, âSo slow in falling?ânow, it cometh down! âWith aggravated wrath the concave lours. âTho' late, with might resistless, Dinevawr âWe conquer'd, and, the Lords of Powis, doom'd âTo fall before us, where are the bless'd fruits?â âStill in our front the hostile spear we see. âLlewellyn then, vanquish'd, and destitute, âFled to his cavern'd heights, impregnable, â'Mid Snowdon, when, O weak and vain! with one, âDriven by necessity to his last point, âI stoop'd to parley, I, his fervent plight, âTrusted, and let the tangled tiger loose, âThis hour to dare England's collected might. âWe have been wrong'd, insulted, scoffed upon! âFalse men have dared to stand upon our soil, âWith their foul threats, to taint the air we breathe, âAnd hurl defiance. Have we not a heart, âBold as our sires!âan arm as vigorous!â âA lance as true? Have we our distant foes âConquer'd, and sent dismay thro' half the world, âSo great our deeds and matchless, now to view âSpirits of puny frame, stand in our front, âWith lifted lance, nor mourn their hardihood? âFrom us and from our sons and our sons sons. âThis shall not be. One path alone is ours. âWarriors! to you, your country delegates âNo mean emprise. Honors, for you reserved, âHover around, of mightiest character. âRenown, so long our friend, now hath uprais'd âHer brazen trumpet, waiting to proclaim, âThat you have conquer'd Cambria's hardy race, âEven men with iron hearts and limbs of steel, âWho erst defied, whilst centuries waned away, âThe fierce-eyed Saxon, the remorseless Dane, âThe Norman, to whose powerful arm, alone, âEven England stoop'd with all her multitude âOf far-famed champions.âThey were left for you! âSpared, for this moment! You, your spears have seized, âResolved, in the recording page of time, âTo shine like meteors, worthy of your name, âYour prince and country! Here, by this good sword! âThat never more shall slumber in its sheath, âWhile foe survives, I vow, bold-hearted chiefs! âTo aid your high resolvesâto lead you forth, âWhence your aspiring spirits may return, âSated with conquestsâyea with nobler fameâ âWith having, for posterity, perform'd âGreat feats, which, in the end, our isle will raise âIn th' scale of nations, by combining hence â(To meet the Foreign Foe,) her scatter'd sons, âNo more, with kindred blood, to stain the spear. âThese are our springs of action, first to scourge â(For injuries unnumbered, unprovoked) âAnd then to healâa Nation's maladies. âHalf measures and half men are not for me! âI swear to live, one object in my heart, âEven t' unite, in one great brotherhood âCambria with England,âthat the happy waves âWhich sport around our shore, may wash alone âOne Empire, soon ordained to lift her head âMatchless in Glory. This th' auspicious day, âWhen favouring time and circumstance are ours. âRejoice, O Subjects! Early as the dawn, âNot even an hour's delay, I at your head, âFrom Chester's towers, we march to victory!â Throughout the place loud exultation reigns. Amid the martial host, one man there was Concord who loved: a venerable man, England's high Primate. He war's path pursued, As well became, to sooth with lenitives The angry bosom, and the fierce resolves Of craving vengeance. Purposes of peace He cherished, nor beheld, ever, the steel, Unsheath'd and glittering, destined for the deeds Of war and slaughter, but he, silently, Like his great master, in his heart, exclaim'd, âPut up thy sword!â The deference Worth receives, E'en from the Rude and Evil, he called forth; For wheresoe'er he pass'd the eye that saw Bless'd him, whilst e'en the man, who never pray'd (Cheated to virtue, and from impulses, Where the heart bursts the fetters of the will) For him one prayer preferr'd. Hearing the shout War utter'd loud, summoning all to join The royal standard 'gainst the Cambrian Prince Llewellyn, with the good man's earnestness To stay the work of death, eager he sought His steel-clad monarch, and with arguments, Alike from Holy Writ and Reason's page, Strove hard to quell the flame, bursting thus forth, With threatnings dread. All unavailable He saw and mourn'd the inflexible resolve. When, now, the king, impatient of delay, March'd toward the foe, he join'd his company, Where, as he hoped, haply some path might rise, Congenial, and that led to peaceful ends. At this important and portentous hour, He heard the king, breathe his dread threatnings forth, And now before the baron and the knight, Thus to his monarch spake. âPrince! hear my words. âO, deem me not disloyal, while I speak âWhat conscience urges, and the still small voice âOf pity and compassion. Pause, O King! âHear thou, thy ancient friend and suppliant! âThy virtue and thy wisdom hazard not âUpon a perilous path, haply unsound, âNor thus for distant and uncertain good âPlunge into discord, and the Fiends of Strife âRouse from their slumber! Trembling I have heard âThis thy resolve, to ravage Cambria!â âTo pull, from his firm seat, down to the dust, âLlewellyn, that unfaithful and fierce man. âEdward! when thou on Asia's blood-red turf, âFighting against the stubborn Infidel, âKings in thy train, âEdward, who followed King Henry in wearing the English erown, but far outwent him in all regal vertues, was abroad at the time of his Father's death, still pursuing his high desires, for the Holy Warres. King Lewis of France, whose perswations had inflamed this noble-spirited Prince to associate him in this glorious quarrell, having first set forth with the enterprise, lay now, in siege of Tunis in Africa, where Prince Edward, with all his forces arriving; the French King (greatly rejoicing in his wished presence) together with the King of Navarre, and other Princes of his Army, went forth to meet him. This place which they beleaguered was not great, but by reason of the situation it greatly impeaded the Christians in their passage through those seas; being built of the scattered ribs and wasted ruines of the mighty and famous City of Carthage. After sharp reinforcement of the seige (where Edward gave frequent proofe of his valour and prudence) capitulations were granted to the Saracens, contrary to Edward's mind, being wholly set to subdue, convert or root them out. This enterprise was supported also, by Charles, King of Sicily. The Seige was thus raised, to the grief and indignation of Edward, who would not partake nor share in any of the Treasures which by reason of the truce was payed by the Saracens, as accounting it to be wickedly gotten, and contrary to the tenor of the vow, which for the honour and advancement of Christian Religion had beene made.â In consequence of this dissention between the King of France and Prince Edward, the French King renounced his intention of proceeding with Edward to Palestine, and immediately returned toward Europe, with all the wealth obtained from the Saracens, in which voyage however, nearly the whole French Army perished in a storm, âtogether with the impious Treasure brought from Tunis.â But Prince Edward nothing daunted, swore, âthat although all his Companions in arms and Countrymen should abandon him, yet he, and Fowin, his Lackey, would enter into Acres, and keep the vow which he had made while soul and body held together.â The English promised with one heart to accompany their Prince, when setting sail, they arrived at Acres, âabout four daies before the City should have beene yeelded up to the Sultan of Babylon, head of the Saracens, but from which precipitation these succours out of England withheld it.ââSpeed. wast wounded, by the dart, âPoison'd, which Treachery sent, thou didst not cry, âVengeance! O subjects. Rush upon the foe, âAnd dye your swords!â Words gentler then were thine. âThou didst allay revenge which call'd for blood; âWith feelings, such as none but bravery owns, âThou, spakest, whilst admiring spirits heard, âWarriors, let fury sleep. On pilgrimage, âTo the adored and holy Sepulchre, âEngland's choice sons are gone. Till these return, âThe sword must pause! the lion heart be still.â âWhen the Christians understood of this cursed assault upon the person of so renowned a Prince, they meant forthwith to have invaded the Pagans wheresoever; but the Prince whose first care was for the safety of Christians, said âI forbid you on the behalf of God, that none of you yet presume to infest the Pagan Armie, because many of our People are gone to visite the holy Sepulchre, who shall every one of them be murthered by the Saracens, if they shall now sustaine any (though but small) vexation at our hands.ââSpeed. âDid Pity then, that seraph from on high, âWhisper sweet words? Monarch, O hear her still! âShe speaks in me!âBefore the unsheath'd sword âGleam in the sun, and fire and spreading waste, âWith fierce retaliation, on all sides, âMark, in their whirlwind sweep the course of war, âLet Reason's voice be heard!

If he consent âTo terms of justice, and deplore the past, âIndemnify thy charge, swear friendship true, âAnd yield the hostage, more thou wilt not ask. âIf he refuse, then let the trumpet sound!â Cried Edward, with an eye-ball flashing fire, âFather! tho', in my sight, no better man âWalks 'mid the face of day, nor one whose word âMight likelier change my purpose, yet, thy prayer, âNow, do I spurn! Tho' on his bended knee, âAbove him Heaven, beneath him gaping Hell, âAnd at his side, Death, with uplifted dart, âTho' to my sight, Llewellyn thus appeared, âAnd with his blood sign'd fealty and remorse, âI would not trust him! He hath pierced our land; âThrough all his track scattering dismay and death. âWith such a foe (these warriors by my side) âI scorn to parley! Father, now no more. âThe hour is past.â The tear slow stealing down His aged cheeks, after a moment's pause, The suppliant spake. âMy gratitude, O King! âThat thou hast heard me, and, yet, once again, âWilt stoop to listen, vainly should I say. âFew words are mine. âWhen, from his den profound, âWar upward springs, his head with plumage wreath'd, âDress'd gorgeously, whilst round on all sides roll âConcords, and notes melodious, and high words, âOf valour, glory, fame, the multitude âHail his approach, nor, 'mid the tumult, hear âThe voice of anguish, the heart-rending sigh, âThe groan slow-drawn of hopeless wretchedness, âWhich, like the yielding element, surrounds âThis Idol Scourge from God. England's high Lord! âNoble and merciful, when passion's storm âReason hath quell'd, pause ere thou raise the sword, âWhich, falling, like the thunder-bolt of Heaven, âIn one promiscuous crash, beats all things down, âWhelming th 'aggressor and the innocent. âWert thou to see, even in the land of foes, âThe cottage, once the seat of happiness, âAnd homely joys, rased by the blast of war; âThe peaceful mountain-flock, now shepherdless, âBleating and scatter'd; children asking loud, âOf some lone, wild-eyed, ghastly traveller, âWringing in all the bitterness of grief, âHis upraised hand, heedless of all around, ââWhere is my father?

Thy alter'd face âTells me, thou could'st not! Generous Potentate! âThese are the light and azure robes, which War, âSporting, puts on! In his vindictive hour, âHis garb is sable!

Thy voice to me, âHath a resistless charm.

Again his bright eye kindled. âGo!â he cried, âYet more with threat than prayer. With aspect firm, âTell him, by mercy urged, I give him space, âWhich, unimproved, yea, should he hesitate, âWhilst thro' the stars the shooting meteor flies, âHe, like his soul-dissolving sires of old, âIn his last hour, shall cryââThe furious foe âDrives us toward ocean; the remorseless wave âUrges us back to death or manacles.â âThou know'st my secret thoughts, how I aspire, âWith vehemence of spirit, to unite, âFor th' good of after ages, for our own, âCambria with England.

What man art thou, who at this dreaming hour Com'st forward, whilst all eyes attracted gaze?â Warwick's stout Earl! Fast to the King he speeds, Who thus address'd him. âBaron, brave and bold, âWith other chiefs, all panting for the fight, âWelcome at Chester!â Warwick loud replied, (No vestibule to his impetuous speech.) âGood tidings, Monarch! Leicester thy late foe, â(Fell'd by thy sword, at Evesham's deadly fight) After Prince Edward had escaped from Simon De Montford, Earl of Leicester, the Earl issued the most peremptory orders to all the King's subjects (Henry III. being still in his hands) to oppose to the utmost of their power, Prince Edward, the Earl of Gloucester, and their adherents. who were all stiled Traitors to the King and State. âBut notwithstanding this, many barons, officers and soldiers, came and offered their service to the Prince, who, in a short time, saw himself at the head of an army, superior to that of the confederates. Then it was that affairs began to have a new face. The Earl of Leicester, who, a little time before, had all the forces of the kingdom at his disposal, could not prevent Edward from becoming master of Gloucester and several other places. He was even forced to give ground to that young Prince, who followed him from place to place, and to use all his policy and experience in order to avoid a battle. As he was a very good General, he took timely care to post himself so as to be able to retreat, whenever he should be pressed. Mean while, he sent repeated orders to his Son Simon, to quit the siege of Pevensey, which detained him in Kent, and come and reinforce him. Simon obeyed, and with his little army began to march with extraordinary expedition, to join him. But as he drew near Evesham, where his Father was encamped, Edward having notice of his coming, suddenly fell upon him with all his forces, and cut in pieces this little body, which could not resist him. âThis victory animating the young Prince with fresh ardour, he immediately returned to attack the Father, before he had received the news of his Son's defeat. He so deceived the watchfulness of the old General, by this sudden resolution, that he was very near the enemy, when the Earl imagined it was his Son coming to his assistance. Leicester's surprize was so great that he could not help shewing it. However, he put every thing in a good posture of defence, perceiving that a retreat would be still more dangerous than a battle. The fight began about two in the afternoon, and lasted till night. He sustained, by his courage and conduct, the efforts of Edward, who fought with an astonishing valour, well knowing that the good or ill fortune of his life depended on the success of that day. At length, after a long resistance on the side of the Barons, the Earl of Leicester and his Son Henry being slain on the spot, their troops were disheartened, and the Prince obtained a full and complete victory. His joy at this success was the greater, as, during the heat of the battle, he had the satisfaction to deliver the King his Father, from the captivity he had been in ever since the battle of Lewes.ââRapin. âWhen in the full tide of prosperity, âPledged his fair daughter, Eleanor de Montford, âTo Cambria's Prince Llewellyn, (even him, âWhom now we seek.) When the rebellious Earl âFell, justly punished, to the Gallic shore, âThe mother, with this maid of tender years, âFearful of danger, fled precipitate. âNow mark my words. Llewellyn, for his bride, âAnxious, as well might be, late, sent a bark âTo bear her safely to the Cambrian shore. âWhen Leolin came to have the government of Wales, he sent unto Philip King of France requiring of him that he might have in marriage the Ladie Eleanor, Daughter to Simon Montford, Earl of Leicester. The French King granted his request and sent her under the conduct of her brother Amoury, to be conveyed into Wales to Leolin; but ere they approached to Wales, at the Isles of Sillie, both the Brother and Sister were taken prisoners by some Ships of Brystow.ââHolinshed. âTwo ships from Brystow (that illustrious town âFor worth and loyalty, and every deed âBefitting tender heart; where virtue thrives âAnd generous impulses, while all that soothes âAnd purifies the spirit, rises round;â âA rampart of divinest hills and trees, âRivers and rocks.) Two ships from Brystow's town, âOn traffic bent, o'ertook the British bark âBearing De Montford, near where Scilly's Isles âSpeckle the deep. A furious fight was there! âThe sinking enemy, resigned her charge, âAnd 'mid the rest, this damsel. On my troth, âTho' never a friend to Leicester, or his cause, âA fairer maid than Eleanor, these eyes â(From young eighteen down to this sober hour, âWatchful of beauty,) never yet beheld. âHer neck is snow, her eye the laughing dove, âHer cheek the white rose blended with the red, âHer air, a goddess. When she smiles, a saint âMight cast side his rosaries and his cross, âAlmost, unblamed, and turn idolater. âYet, all without, naught to the purity âAnd soul-erected eminence within. âThe maiden's fancied dangers and dismays, âThe pleading tears she shed, her sad lament, âHer warm solicitude, raised all her charms âTo the consummate point of excellence, âOn earth, naught higher! On a baron's word, âI wish some colder eye had witness'd it, âWarwick far off. At thy command, O King, âFrom Brystow, my abode, hither I haste, âWith no mean warrior band, anxious to prove âMy zeal and valour in this new campaign, âWhen, as an eagle pounces on his prey, âEngland on Cambria darts her fang of steel. âWhile hast'ning here I placed the captive maid âWith Talbot's Earl, safe in old Glocester's Tower. âThere is another tale. Brief are my words. âShe had a brother, the young Amoury, âWho cheer'd her in her sorrows; a kind youth. âGenerous as brave. From Gallia sailing thus, âAll gay around, it was a mournful thing, âWhen the young pair, so full of pleasant dreams, âSaw themselves prisoners. Each the other bade âFear not, but hope the best, tho' both the while âWere sad and sorrowful, concealing ill, âBy the forced smile, the pang which reign'd within. âThe Captain, a bleak-hearted mariner, âMammon accurs'd, finding De Montford's heir, âAnd this his daughter, both alike proscribed, âWith ice in every vein, reason'd austere, âAnd planned harsh things. He deem'd that they might plot âMeans of escape, or treasons, and ordained, âWith wantonness of folly and of crime, âThat they in different ships, homeward, should sail; âAnd when they parted them, it needed breasts âOf iron frame, to see the sight unmoved. âTears, sighs and looks, and pitiful laments, âPleaded in vain. Unlike the hardy men, â(Rough but humane, uncourtly but sincere) âWho live among the billows, at the scene, âSo melting, this soul-withered mariner âCompunction felt not. He, on future gains, âPonder'd, calm looking on. The twain, by force, âFull in his sight, asunder now are rent, â(The heart reviling what the hands perform'd,) âWhilst many a silent tear was shed: and now âEach at the other looks, till far away, âAnd wafts the unheard blessing. Short the grief âOf the poor youth, for at the even tide, âA storm came on, and, in a woeful hour â(Still to the maid unknown) the ship which held âYoung Amoury, sunk and was seen no more.â Edward replied. âI mourn De Montford's heir. âHad he survived, his king might have reclaim'd, âBy kindness his rude spirit of revolt. âThis mariner, instant the wars are o'er, âI will hang up, high as the steeple tower. âWho pity feels not, pity shall have none. âBut why in Glocester leave fair Eleanor? âAltho' her sire a traitor, yet our arms âWar not with maidens âOne so much admired, âShaming Eve's daughters, all of mortal mould, âI have some wish to see. Speed for her, Earl! âOur ravish'd sight, bless with her countenance.â Abash'd at the command, nor without fears, Nor self-upbraidings, for his forward speech, Bending profound, in silence, Warwick turn'd To seek the damsel, and her steps conduct Safe thitherward, when Edward sudden spake, âBrave Earl, attend! Beauteous thou say'st she is, âA gem! A paragon! By vows betroth'd âTo one, and he, an enemyâWithhold! âI will not see her! Where the maiden dwells, â(Till in our mind the path of honor rise) âThere let her rest! the Virtues tending her, âAnd Heaven her stay!â The warriors, crowding round, Smiled as he spake: âSworn to true courtesy! âA gallant knight!â each to himself exclaim'd, When thus to Warwick's Earl, Edward, again. âBaron! revered, and high in rolls of fame, â(An embassy now to Llewellyn sent) âI pause at Chester. In the face of war âEdward feels confidence, that spear like thine âGleams 'mid his ranks, yet, learn our sudden thought. âInstant I deem it needful, for some chief âOf tried fidelity, and courage stern, âTo haste toward southern Cambria.

Prosperity attend thy path!â Upon his mailed breast, Warwick, his hand Placed, and to earth bent lowly and retired. Again the loud bell told the waning hour! The torch no longer shines, the hall is still. BOOK II. SCENE, Llewellyn and his Army near Snowdon. The gathering cloud, portentous of the storm, Which now o'er Cambria hung, and with its frown Boded destruction, from its first dim birth, Not unobserved drew near. Llewellyn's eye, Watchful of danger, mark'd it far away. Llewellyn (in whose heart the Patriot's fire From infancy, shone, as the moon, full orb'd, On some clear night, when heaven and earth are still,) In threatning pomp, beheld it onward sail, Each moment more austere, more dark, more dread, Yet, at the tempest-burden'd elements, Look'd fearless.âHe, who from his mother's breast, Oft turned and listen'd, with strange wonderment, To some arm'd chieftain, leaning on his lance, Who told of war, and all the biting wrongs His country bore from England, how she stood A mark, at which the enemy, his spear Hurl'd sportive, and regardless heard the groan Heaved from the bursting heart. As years increas'd He often wiped the tear his mother shed, And talk'd, while yet his voice was infantine, Of feats which he would do, when he arose, Matured by manhood, and as thus he spake, His young arm wielded the imagined sword Fierce flashed his eye, the embryo hero shone. After the day's hard hunt, when his brave sire, Returning to his palace, for repose, ('Near Snowdon's base, Aber, that stately pile,) Llewellyn, whilst the wild winds thundering rang Around the mountains, and the closing eve, A melancholy dimness cast around, Oft Griffith met, and led him by the hand, Thro' devious way, towering among the hills, Whilst Cambria's Prince, to the rapt list'ner told Some ancient story; tales of valiant chiefs; How Vortimer, that name to Britons dear! With Hengist and the Saxon Horsa, fought, Fierce, man to man, 'till, by his prowess scar'd, The oppressors of the realm, like autumn leaves Before the whirlwind, fled, or, own'd in death, Their mighty master. The Saxons being alarmed at the success of Vortimer, King of the Britons, applied to the Picts and Scots to join in an alliance to attack him; to this proposal they readily acceded, but Vortimer before the arrival of his northern foes, engaged in battle the Saxons of Kent, under Hengist and Horsa, and completely defeated them. In this battle Horsa, and Cartigern the brother of Vortimer, fell by each other's swords. Hengist having been thus defeated by land retired to his ships, but with heroic valour Vortimer equipped an equal force, and in a severe engagement again defeated him, and ultimately ebliged him to retire into Germany. Then again he told, How in the glorious days which were pass'd by, Uther Pendragon and Ambrosius, Their country's pride, fought nobly, driving far Th' astonish'd foe: how then their arms they bent 'Gainst him, whose name the Briton execrates, The coward Vortigern, who, when beset, Rather than fight the battles of the brave, Sent fatally, for that opprobrious crew, The Saxon, and thus seal'd his nation's curse. But when he told how these illustrious chiefs, Ceaseless, pursued the traitor Vortigern, From haunt to haunt, and now incircled him In Cambrian Castle, 'mid those savage hills, The home of tempests, from which human heart Shrinks back appall'dâwhere, thro' eternal mist, The cataract, plunging from giddy height, Sends forth the voice of thunders, whilst the tide, Forth from obscurity, rushing beneath, Bears its white billows roaring, far away. âIn Radnor is a Great Waterfall, near which is a Castle, whilst round it is a vast desert with dreary irregular paths, and frightful mountains, to which, as to his safest retreat, Vortigern that bane of his country, whose memory is held in abhorrence by the Britons, retired to reflect on the enormity of his crime in calling over the Saxons.â Camden. When thus the warlike Prince told of past times, How here the Traitor fled, till Britain's chiefs, Props of their country, with the raging flame, At length reduced his carcass to the dust Llewellyn, with a zest of transport cried, Whilst his young eye, shot ardour, rolling round, âThese were my ancestors!â Griffith now spake Of Arthur, whose transcendent deeds surpass'd All power of praise, leaving exhausted Fame, Lagging and breathless:âhow his temper'd shield, Display'd its hundred scars, made in past fight, Where none but heroes met, but chiefly then, When he o'ercame, after a bloody day, Colgrin and Pandulf, whilst fleet Cerdic fled, Impetuous as the falcon-hunted bird, Follow'd by vengeance and eternal shame. Arthur's contest with Colgrin and Pandulf, is thus described by Joffery of Monmouth. âBefore the battle with the Saxons, Arthur put on a coat of mail suitable to the grandeur of so potent a King; he fits his golden helmet on his head, on which was engraven the figure of a Dragon, on his shoulders his shield called Priwen; then girding on his Sword Caliburn, he graced his right hand with his Sword named Rose, which was hard, broad, and fit for slaughter. This done he rushed on to the fight, nor did he give over his fury before he had with his Caliburn alone killed four hundred and seventy men. The Britons, seeing this, follow their Leader in great crowds and make slaughter on all sides, so that Colgrin and Pandulf his Brother, and many thousand more fell before them. Cerdic on this imminent danger betook himself to flight.â Berington, in his history of Henry II. says, that at an interview of Richard I. with Tancred King of Sicily, Richard presented him with the above noted sword Caliburn, which had effected such prodigies by the British Arthur. Llewellyn cried, his young heart throbbing high, âO glorious Briton! May I live like him âWorshipp'd in song. My great Progenitor! âThee will I imitate, and with thee share âMy country's adoration!â Griffith spake, (With a solemnity which awed his soul) âIf great and honorable feelings rise, âAnd thirst of deed magnanimous, O son! âThink on thy nation, Cambria! how she groans âBeneath the living Saxon! Let thy mind âTo the high point aspire, of rescuing, âFrom her ignoble thrall, thy Native Land, âAnd be the Patriot!â At the solemn word Llewellyn clasp'd his hands! Looking to Heaven, âMy Father!â he exclaim'd, âhere do I swear; âUpon this mountain altar, should my days âExtend to manhood, to devote my thoughts, âMy heart, my life, to the high enterprise âOf rescuing this my country. She shall rise, âFrom her abased state, a peerless Queen! âAgain her ancient glory shall return! âAnd th' Nations of the Earth shall worship her!â The days pass on, and now the hour is come, When Cambria totters. Her high confidence Rests on one man, Llewellyn, than whose soul, No braver ever tenanted awhile A fleshly mansion. When the news arrived That Edward had assembled his bold knights And men at arms, all in habergeon clad, As frequent references must be made in this poem to the armour worn by knights, at this period, I think it best to give a brief account of the principal parts of a knight's dress, for the conveniency of those to whom the subject may not be familiar:â Chausses. A breeches of mail, which covered the feet and legs, and part of the thighs. Sometimes the feet (according to Gough) were defended with shoes, composed of double chain mail. Gambeson. This was a garment made of cloth or leather, stuffed with wool, &amp;c. fitted to the body, and designed to preserve warmth, as well as to defend from the chafing of the armour. Froissart says that John Tycle, a maker of gambesons in London, furnished the Insurgents under Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, with sixty pair, for which he charged twenty pounds, so that the value of these must have been six shillings each. Persons of consideration wore gambesons made of more costly materials, quilted with gold, &amp;c. Gorget, or throat-piece. This was made of iron or steel, adjusted to the neck, and worn immediately above the gambeson, and under the coat of mail. It was the accidental omission of a gorget, which occasioned the death of Ernald de Mounteney, who was slain in a tournament at Waldon, by Roger de Lemburne. Hauberk, Habergeon. These names are often used in a synonymous sense, and signify a coat of mail. The hauberk however properly consisted of a coat or jacket, composed of mail or plate armour' without sleeves. This was the dress appropriate to knights. The habergeon was a large breast-plate, and was worn chiefly by esquires. Singlaton, a coat or mantle made of rich materials. Surcoat. A large external garment charged with armorial bearings. Casque or Helmet. This was either open or close. The open helmets covered merely the head and neck, leaving the face unguarded. The close helmet covered the head, face, and neck, having in front apertures and slits for the admission of air, and which enabled the eye to distinguish surrounding objects. The part which lifted up was called the visor. The beaver was an improvement and was contrived to let up or down. Greaves. An iron defence for the legs. These were sometimes called Chausses. Gauntlet, a flexible iron glove. To throw the gauntlet on the ground was considered as an offer of fight which was picked up by him who chose to accept it. The whole of a knight's armour was often of great weight. Froissart speaks of four Italian knights who had come into France to seek adventures, and engaging in a war, in which they were unhorsed, from thickness and weight of their armour, they were incapable of rising, and were come at with great difficulty to be slain by their enemies. His cross-bow warriors, archers, javlin-men, Nurtured in strife, and sworn to subjugate The land that gave him birth, roused from short rest, Llewellyn grasp'd his spear, and summons sent To all his cantreds, chieftains, and true friends, Again t' assemble, furnish'd for the war, Round Snowdon, bulwark of the Cambrian land. On that triumphant day, in vigour clad, Among the rest appear'd, Merfyn the bold, With Anarawd and Edwall his brave son, Plumed for the war, Rhys Enyd, Meredyth, Cynan, and Walwyn son of that old chief, Vychan, so known in fight, and Roderic, Gwenwyn, and Cabell, Meyrion, Howell-Rhy, Owen and Gronow, Johnes, and Goronwy, Einion and Tudor, men for prowess famed, And Brychwain, Arthol, Rhyderch, with a host So fill'd with high resolves, that, on himself, Each half relied, and Cambria on them all. The sun had mounted to the noon of day, When, circled by his warriors, firm of heart, Llewellyn stood. Clear was the firmament. Old Snowdon, with austere magnificence, Beside him rose, crag piled on massy crag; Here rifted by the war of elements, There green and shaven by the summer flocks, Thick scatter'd, which around the mountain steeps, With the perpetual tread, wore their long lines; Paths, like an ancient amphitheatre Rising, or here or there, till veil'd in clouds. Faint, blending with the air, before him rose. Mona, that choice and fragrant isle, the seat Of bardic lore, with ocean and her line Of blue transparency, by passing winds Unruffled. 'Mid this fair and peaceful scene, Which banished each harsh, inharmonious thought, His circling chiefs, Llewellyn thus address'd. âMen! to your country dear, I welcome you! âYour sires, now slumbering, 'neath this hallow'd ground, âThe native heirs of Freedom! 'mid the winds, âWhich now we feel, and on this mountain turf, âThese crags sublime, nourished their limbs and lived âAs unconstrain'd as the descending stream âThat rolls beside us. They were all brave men; âFor valour famed. The price of liberty âFull well they knew. Tasting its sacred sweets, âAnd willing to bestow, on us, their sons, âThe treasure, first of earthly kind, they swore, âNever to let the foot of enemy âPress our green sward. We, their inheritance, âSo dearly purchased, at this hour enjoy! âAnd shall we not, like our brave fathers, swear âStill to transmit the uncorrupted boon âDown to our children? The hard labouring breath âWith which you stem your spirits, answers, yes! âSons of illustrious sires, this is the hour, âWhen words must e'en assume substantial form, âAnd rise to action. Edward our proud foe, âWhose might we erst have combated and scorn'd, âNow hastens, with a host, vast as the stars âWhich throng night's concave. His collected force, âWith all habiliments and pomp of war, âHovers upon our frontiersâknights and squires, âAnd barons bold, with rage implacable, âAnd swearing to reduce, us and our race, âTo abject chains. Vain threat of impotence! âFetter the mountain sons of liberty! âTeach us to eat subjection's bitter bread! âExtinguish the immortal spark, which glows âWithin our breast, kindled, when Brutus died, âOur great progenitor! Joffery of Monmouth gives a minute account of Brutus, the founder of the British Empire, but in the âLife of Ambrosius Merlin, with his strange propheciesâ it is more succinctly stated, as follows. âBrute was of the ancient and noble blood of the Trojans, descended from Ãneas and Creusa the Daughter of King Priam. This Brute, at fifteen years of age, by the unfortunate glancing of his arrow, slue his Father, for which disastrous act, he willingly exiled himself, and taking with him a choice company of adventurers, thought to discover some new plantation. To omit his many troubles, both by land and sea, at length he incountered a small navy of ships, of which a Trojane, and his near kinsman was Captain, whose name was Corineus, who joining their forces together, and after sundry and divers perils, landed in this Island (from its white and chalky cliffs) called Albion, where finding none but giants of mighty stature, he destroyed the most part of them: of whom the greatest both in bulke and command, was called Gogmagog, with whom Corlneus wrastling, to prove their triall of strength, Gogmagog in his gripe broke a rib in the side of Corineus, at which he being enraged, gathering all his spirits about him, cast him down the high Rock of Dover, (the place where they proved their mastery) which is called the fall of Gogmagog to this day, for which and other his valiant acts before achieved Brute gave him an entire province, which from his name beareth the title of Cornwall. Brute then taking full view of the Island, scarching up the river Thames, built upon it a city, which in remembrance of the late subverted Troy, he called Troynovant, or New Troy, now London: this done he put his souldiers to the tilling of the earth and governed the realm peaceably for the space of twenty four years. Brute had three sons, between whom in his life-time he divided his kingdome. To Locrine the eldest, he gave all that is called England. To the second Son Cambrius or Cambre, he gave the now Country of Wales. To the third son Albanact, he gave the north part of the land, then titled from him Albania, now Scotland. This done he expired and was buried at Troynovant. This early account of the Britons, has often been considered as the fabrication of Joffery of Monmouth. Sammes (Anti. An. Bri.) says, âThe composing of Brutus Geneology, the methodizing the circumstances of his life, the timeing of his entrance, the succession of his life, depends all on the credit of Joffery.â This perhaps is too sweeping an assertion. The story, as collected from Joffery is as follows. That Walter Mapeus, Arch-deacon of Oxford, in the reign of Henry I. happened while he was in Armorica, to light upon a history of Britain, written in the Welsh tongue, and carrying marks of great antiquity, which he brought over with him to England, and committed to Joffery of Monmouth, to translate. It is to be observed that this history, thus translated, was universally received as genuine at the time it was made public; while the learned Humphry Lhwyd, Sir John Price, and Dr. Powell, have supported its authenticity. Joffery cautions his contemporaries, William of Malmsbury and Henry of Huntingdon, in these words, against writing the history of the Britons. âI advise them to be silent concerning the Kings of the Britons, since they have not that book, writ in the British tongue, which Walter, Arch-deacon of Oxford, brought out of Britain (Armorica) and which being a true history, published in honour of those Princes, I have thus taken care to translate.â As a further argument to prove that Joffery's account of the origin of the Britons, is a genuine translation from an old Welsh Chronicle and not a fabrication, it may farther be stated, that Henry of Huntingdon (whom Joffery mentions as his contemporary historian,) though he had treated of the origin of the Britons and of Brutus the founder of their race, in the history which he had published before he had seen Joffery's translation; yet afterwards happening, as he says, to âlight on Joffery's work, at Bec in Normandy,â he to complete his account of the ancient British affairs, and to testify to the world his confidence in the validity of Joffery's recent translation, made an abstract from it, and subjoined it as an appendix to his original history. These considerations may induce the reader to acquit Joffery of having deliberately deceived the world with the publication of a fictitious narrative, although (with Camden) it is to be wished that the authority on which the above British work rests, were better known and substantiated. Impossible! âTh' unconquer'd sword, wielded by arms like ours, âShall teach this fierce Plantagenet, once more, âThat Cambria is, and was, and will be free! âThe goodly sight, which now encircles us, âOf woods, and hills, and ocean, flocks and flowers, âUpon my labouring and oppressed sight, âFlashes the melancholy thought. O Chiefs! âTho' in the end our name, more glorious, âWill shine thro' earth, and bear to farthest time âThe dread memorial, how our ravenous swords âConsumed the enemy, yet, O my sons! âThe father's feelings twine about my heart! âCan I behold this wide and rapturous sight, âThis scene of fair tranquillity, this land, âWhere all that soothes the mind buds and brings forth, âNor mourn, o'er the impending hurricane, âThe tempest, louring, and ordain'd to fall, âEre long, in showers of blood! Where then will be âThese hamlets, scattered o'er the fertile land, âWhere Peace hath stray'd, and Happiness, so long, âHeld her calm dwelling? Where will then be found âThese flocks, now brousing on the mountain herb; âThese shepherds, peaceful men, from morn to night âTending their charge?

Llewellyn paused, from the o'erflowing soul, Whilst all who round him stood, felt as he felt: One general feeling, one wide impulse their's; Even like the loud North-East, when he combines A thousand scatter'd breezes, and comes on, Flood-like, with all his retinue of storms. Amid the general hush, while thus they stood, Calm, motionless; winding round Snowdon's base A host of glittering spears rose on the view! An armed multitude, with eager step, Hastening direct to where Llewellyn stood! It was the chief Rhywaldon!

Then a fire, within, âKindled. I felt the feelings of remorse â(Like one recovering from a frozen swoon) âTingling in every vein. I sprang to life! âHere do I stand thy friend! To expiate âThe deeds, which sink my head, down to the dust, âI now appear, with this my gallant host, âSworn to fulfil, in sunshine and in storm, âThe patriot and the warrior's purposes.â Llewellyn rose, and, grasping the bold chief, Exclaim'd, âRhywaldon! darkness veils the past. âI hail thee, and e'en fuller confidence âPlace on thy manly word. No play is ours! âThou com'st, in rescuing this thy character, âTo feats of hardihood and such bold deeds âAs hearts, like thine, delight in.

This will I affirm, âAnd most undoubting, as the stream is true âTo its own shores, so true is David's heart âTo thee and to thy cause, and such till death âThat man must be whom Edwall calls his friend.â The Prince exclaim'd. âA sober company, âHast'ning, I view.â One now approach'd and cried. âEdward hath sent his Bishop, with full powers âTo treat of amity.â âThe reverend sire,â âKnown for his virtues, guide to our near hall.â Llewellyn spake. âThere will we conference hold.â Instant the Lord of Snowdon, and his Chiefs, Pass on to Aber's tall and stately pile. BOOK III. SCENE, The Palace of Aber, near Snowdon. In Aber's splendid palace, long renown'd For princely hospitality, the Chiefs, Llewellyn at their head, now all appear'd. The aged Bishop, slow and thoughtfully, Pass'd up the Hall, his white and flowing locks Casting an air of majesty that awed Th' intent beholder, whilst his pensive face Told of no common mind and, ere he spake, Disposed all hearts t' approve what he might say. A seat, beside Llewellyn, now received The venerable Prelate, whilst around, Attention and a general silence reign'd. The Lord of Snowdon, courteous, thus began. âFather, revered, we all, with anxious minds, âWould know thy message, and what drew thee here. âSpeak on!â The Prelate, bending, thus replied. âMy Son! and you my Children, at this hour, âHear me with patience! Strife and turbulence, âAnd all the venom-breathing words and deeds âWhich war displays, are not my element; âI love the silent solitary haunts âOf tranquil meditation, and the hour âWhen hearts send forth their heaven-ward orisons, âImploring the best gifts on all mankind. âThe Saviour of the World, as well you know, âHath bless'd the man whose soul delights in peace, âAnd he who makes it. Such would I be found. âI come, brave Prince, leaving all milder scenes, âTo strive with earnestness, ere war begin, âTo close the breach, and pour the healing balm âInto the bosom, wounded, and disturb'd âWith wrath and dread resolves. Nor yet too late. âHear me my Son! My words are gentleness. âLet not thy bosom spurn at what I say, âWhen I implore, in peaceful brotherhood, âThat thou, with Edward, England's Prince, wouldst dwell. âI am no sage and subtile reasoner âOn policy and questions of deep state; âI only long to see the casque and spear, âPlaced harmless by, and peace once more return, âTo bless the land of my nativity. âIn cause, like, this I know that thou wilt make âSome sacrifice. O Son, restrain thy soul! âAnd when thou hear'st advice, adverse, perchance, âTo thy resolves, yet listen, and believe âIt springs alone from love to thee and thine.â âFor what if Edward, England's lofty King, âWho speaks, and, like the Persian, turns not back, âWhat if the Conqueror of Palestine âShould in his heart have sworn, that he will have âEven thy subjection, not for private end, â(Source of the conquests known thro' Christendom) âResentment or ambition, but, to form âEngland, the pride of isles, into a great âAnd towering empire, joining into one âIts scatter'd elements.

Thus he exclaim'd. âFather? I hear thy words, âAnd wert thou not in priestly garment clad, âThese hands would shew thee the same way thou cam'st, âAnd I would hurl thee forward, answered thus, âSend thee with scorn, to thy proud potentate. âEdward indulge the high imperious hope âOf my subjection!âIn that day, may Heaven âExtinguish my dishonor'd spark of life, âAnd whelm my name in deathless infamy! âHere do I stand the representative âOf a long line of glorious ancestors, âIn whom all princely excellence and worth âBeam'd cloudless forth. The brave Cynethean race, âThe Cynethean Family descended from Coel a Northern Prince, who, by his marriage with the Heiress of North Wales, became the Sovereign of that Principality. Helena, the Daughter of this Prince, succeeded to his dominions, and was afterwards married to the Roman Emperor Constantius. The line of Helena becoming extinct, the Principality of North Wales devolved on Cynetha her Nephew, whose brave descendants inherited the throne, down to Llewellyn.ââRoxland. âWho call'd its own, each name to Cambria dear, âAnd dear to fame, now centres in myself. âTill from my veins each drop of noble blood âFlow refluent, and other heritage âInfuse its tainted current round my heart, âNe'er shall Llewellyn stoop to mortal man! âFather forgive my warmth. I fear my words, âMost undesign'd, have been discourteous. âI reverence thee, I do respect thy name, âAnd own thy pure intentions in this suit: âYet, at the word thus tempting me to yield âMy all to Edward, like the imprisoned flood, âMy thoughts must force their passage and speak out. âNow, Father, in the spirit of mild words, âLet me inquire, what further Edward speaks.â The Prelate thus replied, âMy hairs are grey. âHear me but patiently. Of grievous things âEdward complainsâof thy oft slighted words, âAnd faithless oaths; that thou hast broken truce, âAnd spite of peace, confirm'd and ratified, âSeized on his castles, ravaged his fair lands, âAnd forced him, as he says, by the sword's edge, âTo vindicate his honour and his right.â âFather!â Llewellyn cried, âthis is the point âOn which I stand or fall. Hear me I pray. âFree am I to confess, that Cambria, now, âFirst drew the sword, that I, with open front, âWarfare declared, and, with what might I had, âSeized on the lands and castles and strong holds âThat bordered on my kingdom, and sent forth âDefiance to my own and country's foe. âThe cause which roused the tempest in my heart, âThat urged my hand to seize once more the sword, âAnd plunge in discord, thou thyself shalt judge. âO Father, not vain thoughts and reasonings âShould urge a heart, like mine, a lover true âOf mildness and sweet concord, to forget âIts steady nature, and in battle join, â(Taking the sad vicissitudes of war) âWith one, like Edward. Well I know his might, âNor should aught earthly but necessity, âStrong, harsh necessity, force to a deed âPregnant with horror and such bitter drops, âAs war, whate'er th' event, thick showers on all. âTho' of this Isle my fathers call'd themselves âLords and high Potentates, holding their sway âWith no presumed and false authority; âTho' they beheld subjection on all sides, âAnd promised, in their plenitude of power, âThat never a foe should breathe on British ground, âStrange scenes have risen! A distant and false race, âInvited by the traitor Vortigern, âFrom foreign lands came over, and subdued, âO my forefathers! conquer'd this fair isle,â âAll but brave Cambria! There the Victor stay'd! âHis boasted laurels wither'd on his brow!â âVain were it now to hope, by valiant deeds, âTo reinstate our ancient dynasty, âAnd drive th' obtruding children of false friends âBack to their howling sands and savage wastes; âThat were a deed, perhaps, impossible! âArthur! thy days were brief! A traitor's sword âSent thee, untimely, to the land of shade! Arthur had gone into Armorica to assist his nephew, king Howel, when his nephew Mordred, (with whom in his absence he had entrusted the government of Britain) proved a traitor. Returning to his own kingdom, Arthur met Mordred at Camlan, in Cornwall. The traitor was defeated and slain, but Arthur, in the conflict, received a wound, of which he lingered for some time, and at length died. He was interred at Glastonbury Abbey.â âI will keep down th' impetuous thoughts that rise!â âSanction'd by time, th' aggression long pass'd by, âLet the proud Saxon hold his stolen prize! âI covet not! yet, O thou honor'd shade! âO Brutus! and thou hero-killing chief, âArthur! and bold Ambrosius! first of men! âI swear to hold, what my brave fathers gave, âInflexible! my foot, the granite rock, âBraving the ocean, and on terms alone, âJust, independent, such as well befits âLlewellyn, Griffith's son, will I renounce âMy confidence in this well-temper'd sword, âAnd Edward call, my brother and my friend. âNow, Father, we will talk on nearer points. âI, first declared for war, this do I own.â âBrace thou thy tender heart with fortitude âFirm as old Snowdon, whilst Llewellyn tells âThe cause which roused him from his short repose. âWhen late, with mutual wish, Edward and I âSheath'd the blood-red and man devouring sword, âDeep oaths were our's, to cease all cause of strife, âTo act the just and honorable part, âNor authorise, either to each, the act âUnfair or hostile. Since that hour, all wrongs, âWith an augmented and o'erwhelming weight, âCambria hath borne!

Bradshaw, in his life of St. Werburg, relates, that, in the year 1119, Richard the First, on his going upon a pilgrimage to the Holy Well of St. Wenefrede, (in Wales) was suddenly attacked by the Welsh, and forced to take shelter in Bassingwerk. âThere is a tradition that Richard, in his dilemma, applied to St. Werburg for relief, who miraculously raised certain sands, between Flintshire and Wiral, and thus gave means for his Constable to pass to his assistance, which sands, from that time, are called the Constable's Sands.â âPennant. âWhose aged walls, reverenced thro' centuries wide, âHad call'd each traveller's blessing as he pass'd, âWas whelm'd in forked flames, even David's walls, âMost venerable pile! sacred to him âWhose matchless virtues, every Cambrian knows, âAnd loves, and imitates, even this bequest, âLeft by our pious ancestors, whose aisle, âEntomb'd our tutelary Saint, our pride, âThis church was rased by the vindictive foe! âDyngad too fell: yea hoary Lantredaff âFor sanctity and sabbath-like repose, âLong known, secure amid the quiet vale, âToo poor to stop the pilferer on his way, âThese sons of waste, in th' sacrilegious hour, âSeized on, and, with mad fury, laid it low. The spirit of sacrilege, must have appeared in a light peculiarly flagitious to Llewellyn and his subjects, for âWelshmen, above all other nations, were accustomed to reverence Churches, and to attribute much honour unto Ecclesiastical persons. They used not to touch the most deadlyest Foes they had, if they escaped unto the Church.â H Lhuyd's Breviary of Britayne. âStill darker words are mineâthe pious men, âThere dwelling, perish'd, whilst th' unsparing foe, âFrantic with ecstasy, look'd on and laugh'd. âThe Fleming Venables, by Edward urged, âHe did the spoil, the being, at whose name, âUtter'd in whisper, from his nurse's breast, âThe babe will start! and in amaze look round, âFeeling instinctive pains! without a pang, âHe burnt that lowly convent.

This do I affirm, âBelieve it of thy foe. Edward our king âBears in his breast, a heart assailable âTo honor's voice, to violated right âSent forth, from high or low. Edward declares, âO noble Prince! that thy vindictive men, âDwelling along the March, unceasing spoil âAnd ravage with the bitterness of death. âCanst thou, with arguments, clear up this point? Llewellyn spake, âHoly and reverenced man! âThere is a curse to Cambria in that March, âAnd its fierce Lords! There, towering in their pride, âWith fraud and violence, their castles teem, âAnd forth they go, e'en in the dead of night, âImpatient to pursue their ravages, âMouthing the sun, so slow in going down. âFor ages, that hath been the secret fount âOf bitter waters, and e'en now it flows, âPoisoning the very flowers that harbour near, âSimon Le Strange, a base free-booting lord, âThere dwells, with Venables, that monster man, âWhose heart is adamant. There Scrotchill too, âAnd Lonsdale, hold their lawless court, and reign, âKings of their district, laughing at all right. âIf ever Cambrians do the deed unkind, âIt is that they are stung and hurried on âTo madness, by the inj'ries and deep wrongs âOf these March Lords. Now Father, let me hear, âWhat further, Edward, vaunting, or in sport, âTalks of Llewellyn.â Thus the Prelate spake. âLord of this ancient realm and far renown'd âAmong earth's princes, no designs are mine âTo rouse thy spirit, and, by angry words, âCall up thy soul's fierce feelings, I would fain âSpeak lenient things, but as I do believe âThat Edward, in his rage, will o'er this land âScatter destruction, if thou soothe him not, âI would implore thee, timely, to concede âSome slender things, so, haply, thou mayst 'scape, âAnd this thy land, the tempest of his rage. âDeem not the words I speak, harsh or unkind. âHe mourns, (as he declares) when thou wast driven âTo thine extremity and hopelessness âHung on thy rear, that he should grant thee peace, âAs late he did.

Imperious man and proud! âDoth he deplore, that, in an evil hour, âHe granted peace to Cambria, when her Prince, â(As he believes) driven to extremity âStood hopeless! Ill doth Edward, know this heart, âThrice, from the land of hills, I beat his sire, âOld Henry back. When Edward, a young Prince, âFrom jousts and tournaments, far o'er the sea, âCame dancing to the war, discomfited, âI sent him, too, to tell his piteous tale. âWhen late a King become, he scourged our land, âAnd, jealous of renown! wasted and spoiled, âTracking his path with blood and violenceâ âNo foe beheld, he fancied that this heart âTrembled and fled:âI waited patiently âOn Snowdon, where I taught him lesson stern, âNot soon to be forgotten! Doth he say âDespondency was ours. How was it shewn, âWhen in one day three âLucas De Tanye was buried at Grest Stanbridge. He with several Earls, twelve of the King's Chiefest Captains and Knights, besides seventeen Young Gentlemen and two hundred Common Soldiers, were slain by the Welshmen, in the tenth year of King Edward the First.ââWeaver's Funeral Monuments. English Earls lay low, âAnd with the rest, De Tanye, first of knights, âWhen blood-dyed standards Cambria nobly won, âWhile Edward, panic struck, to the first hold, âFled eager, saving life, but losing fame. âThe day which Llewellyn had of King Edward himselfe may not bee forgotten, in which the Welsh slew three English Earls and got foureteene Ensigns from the English Armie, King Edward being enforced to enter into the Castle of Hope for safety.ââSpeed. âWhere then was our despondency? Vain speech! âThere were a thousand latent energies âReady to rise, that, had not peace return'd, âWould evermore have link'd in brotherhood, âDisgrace and Edward. âFather! thy late words âHave awed, not terrified Llewellyn's heart. âI feel a calm solemnity pervade âMy inmost spirit. Speech befits me now âWhere passion is not. Now the time is come, âWhen courage, clothed in sober garb, must speak. âHear me, most pious Father! and, ye Chiefs, âDear to your country, mark my serious words. âO Sire! in thy most righteous earnestness âTo follow and promote, peace, Heaven's best gift, âThou urgest me some slender things to yield âFreely to EdwardâSlender things are vain! âHe seeks them not! His most aspiring heart, âThis do I know, well satisfied, will rest, âWith nothing but the ruin of this landâ âAn utter conquest!

Let thy Herald, me, âHeal the wide breach: and is there not a charm âIn conqu'ring the proud heart; curbing the rein âOf head-strong passion; bridling pride, that foe âTo God and man? Spare thou the christian's blood! âSubdue thyself! so Heaven shall prosper thee.â Llewellyn cried, âOne only word is mine, âWhich I, to thee, speak with meek reverence. âBear this resolve to Edward.âSnowdon's Lord, âLlewellyn, with his host of warriors bold, âAsks justice, and to hold his land in peace. âIf Edward, with an open front, will grant âThese simple articles, he, the true friend, âShall find in Cambria, if notâa foe! âHis be the choice!

I perceive âThou art an injured man, and if the time, âSo sought, should come, that I can plead thy cause, âAnd, from thee, turn the tide of Edward's ire, â(Touching his heart, his vulnerable point,) âPrince, doubt me not. All-righteous Heaven ordain, âBrave men! that souls like yours may yet unite! âFarewell!â The Prince replied, âFather, farewell!â BOOK IV. SCENE, The Palace of Aber, near Snowdon. Since first from Chaos, towering in his might, Old Snowdon rose, never had he beheld So vast a family, all clad in arms, Circling his mighty base. Upon this spot (Impregnable, thro' many a scene of strife, And warfare past) Llewellyn, dauntless stood, Waiting the time, when Edward, drawing near, Might wake the storm of vengeance, mid the weight Of sore anxiety, with thoughtful brow, Llewellyn call'd his friends and counsellors, Sage Anarawd and Walwyn. Thus he spake. âTho' dangers threaten, and, this hour, a foe, âGreater than ever Cambria knew, appears âIn war array, and ready to begin âSuch conflicts as might pall the coward's breast, âYet e'en this threat'ning circumstance, so fair âFor great occasion, in our hearts, I trust, âExcites high joyance. Morn and noon and night, âMy country's image swims before my eyes. âI see her rise, from the portentous mists, âAnd ponderous clouds, that now encircle her, âBright, and surcharged with glory. Whilst I wait, âOr peace, or war, amid the dark suspense, âOne thought oppresses and half weighs me down. âYou know De Montford, England's mighty Lord, âDarling of freedom, fall'n alas! that he âWas my peculiar friend. Kind offices âWe each display'd, and I to you must tell, âHe had a Daughter, sweeter than the light, âFair as the lily, pure as morning's snow. âI loved her, but the rose, just bursting forth, â(When thus her sire, fell in his country's cause) âShe fled, with her scared mother, to expand âIn safety, on the genial soil of France. âSighing to call the beauteous prize my own, âMy Eleanor De Montford! late I sent âA noble bark, to bear her to this land. âEach day do I expect her. O thou war! âBlaster of all the milder charities, âDomestic joys, sweet sympathies, the sky âIn which the brooding tempest ever lours, âThou hast no friend in me! The sudden clouds âWhich now involve us, little were foreseen, âOr I had stay'd the hour, distracting thought! âThe moment of our meeting. Faithful men, âWhilst now the thunder in the frowning sky âPauses a little space, fly to the coast, âAnd thence conduct the brightest gem of earth, âTo Aber and these arms. I here will count âThe moments, till ye hasten back again. As Anarawd and Walwyn pour'd their thanks For confidence thus great, and now had turn'd To seek the coast, and bear the lovely maid To him, who knew her worth to estimate, One enter'd with unwonted speed, and cried, âBy Eleanor De Montford, I am sent âTo bear thee this.â Llewellyn seized the scroll! He read, fire flashing from his eager eyeâ Eleanor thy promised bride, From thine arms, is torn away; By old Severn's rapid tide, She is sad who once was gay, Desolate as maid may be, Yet, Llewellyn, true to thee. At the summons Love convey'd, To the waiting bark I sped; In the breeze the streamer play'd, The sun, around, his glories shed, Birds chanted loud their carols wild, Whilst heaven and earth and ocean smiled. Ah! little thought I of the fate, Too soon to whelm me in despair;â That I should to my prison grate Fly, to breathe the balmy air, And, 'mid my oft-tumultuous fear, Find friend, nor soothing parent near. Down to the beach my Mother came, Cheerful, as she strove to be;â I saw her turn, dear sainted name, And shed a tear, a tear for me! Of her captive daughter's woe, May she never, never know! O'er the curling billows borne, Fast I left the gallic shore; Thy Eleanor forgot to mourn, For Love, inviting, sailed before: Joy proclaimed her jubileeâ I, Llewellyn, thought of thee! A sudden cloud o'ercasts the sky! At hand, two hostile ships appear!â The scenes are past, and I will try To check the unavailing tear! Born to grief and sorrow's heir, I, alone, my portion bear! The best of Brothers, good and kind, From my side, nor succour near, He, by war, with fury blind, Was dragged to dungeons dark and drear: His frantic grief, his last adieu, Still with shuddering heart I view! Amoury! thy life is sought, All our promised joys are o'er; I shall see, O piteous thought! I shall see thy face no more! Yet thy memory, sweet to me, Amoury! will ever be. The dearest friend, of many dear, Thus, with me, I call to weep; Yet, while thou dropt'st affection's tear Still thy stately tenor keep! Wield the sword of Roderi, Till thy foes beneath thee lie! Wherefore from a maid like me Should these warlike accents flow? I would not endanger thee For all the choicest gifts below. Terrors, that new terrors wake, Round and round their circuit take. Mourn not tho' the piercing blast O'er my head, unshelter'd, flies; May thy evil days be past! May thy prosperous star arise! Yet, sometimes, tho' vain it be, Wilt thou sighing think of me? At evening's still and solemn close, I look toward Cambria's mountain bound; And bless the river, as it flows From meads and hills, where thou art found: In its waters hurrying by, Oft Llewellyn's form I spy. Must I, from my spirit cold, Tear the last hope glimmering there? Must I watch the hours unfold With the fix'd eye of despair? Amid the bleak and wintry sky, Expect no joy, no summer nigh? Tho' it be delusion vain On which my faithless dreams recline; I will banish grief and pain, The dawn of fortune still may shine; Hope, that glistens thro' my tear, Whispers, happier days are near. Ah! I hear, 'mid Severn's roar, A voice, as of a seraph mild; Which says, that thou wilt never more See De Montford's sorrowing child! Farewell Llewellyn! round my head, Still deeper mists and shadows spread! Yet, as before me, earth declines, The sun, upon thy brow, appears! His fairest beam, there, lingering shines!â Thou source of all my hopes and fears, When I am dead, which soon will be, I know that thou wilt think of me. To earth, the scroll, falls, from his trembling hand. The chieftains back return'd. âBad news my Lord?â Eearnest they said. âO'erwhelmingâ he exclaim'd. âMy Eleanor, the captive of my foe! âSpare me one moment.â After a brief pause, Trembling, the Prince began. âO Friends and dear! âThis is indeed the bitterness of death! âThe hour, so waited for, arrived at last!â âThe cup just raised to my impatient lipsâ âDash'd furious down!ââThere was an eloquence In the unbroken silence, reigning round. Slowly Llewellyn spake. âThe setting sun âLovely appeared. I saw him calm descend, âBright clouds around him, to the ocean's verge, âI raised my eyes, my brain with glory fill'd, âMy heart with praise, and when once more I look'd, âThere was no sun! sunk was the orb of fire, âAll vanish'd, in the bosom of the deep!â The lengthen'd sigh sent forth, Llewellyn cried, âHow fared the Cambrian bark?â The man replied. âTruly, my Lord, in that disastrous hour, âWhen the ships fought upon the quiet sea, âThan the robbed tigress, fiercer, the good bark âCambria sent forth, sank in the mighty deep. âHer captain, noble man! fought lion-likeâ âHe perish'd in that day! and many a one, âBold, like himself, for ever closed his eye, âBefore the British flag, in the blue wave, âPlunged headlong.â Cried the earnest Prince âO, say! âWas Eleanor unhurt?â âUntouch'd of harmâ The man replied. âAs the o'erpower'd bark, âSinking, withdrew, from the unequal fight, âShe, from the lofty prow, leap'd, fearlessly, âTo the adjacent ship, and as she leap'd, âThe bark, thus yielding up her precious prize, âWith much of bravery in her, downward sank! âThe waves closed over her, and all was still!â âBrave man!â Llewellyn cried, âand who art thou?â âA soldier,â he replied; âa humble name. âI watch'd at Gloster, where Earl Talbot rules. âNor doubt, O Prince! that pity I had much âFor Eleanor, that most imperial maid âFor loveliness! I, at her window, long, âBeheld her weeping, and as late I stood, â(The moon just rising from her cloudy bed) âLow on the terrace, she, for aught I know, âMight see compassion in my countenance, âWhen slow she spake, âStranger, if well I deem, âThou hast a heart can feel for wretchedness. âMight I implore one favour at thy hand?â âI never, till that hour, had heard her speech, âAnd now, so new a voice stole on my ear, âSo plaintive and so sweet, that I, awhile, âFancied some angel spake, for human tongue, âMethought had never equalled strains like these. âWondering I stoed, when thus again she cried. âHast thou a feeling breast, for woes like mine?â âYes, maiden! I exclaim'd. A heart that vows âTo do thee any service, far or near, âNow or hereafter. âGen'rous youth, she cried, âHeaven will reward thee. I have one request. âForth, to Llewellyn, Cambria's noble Prince, âThis scroll, convey.â She cast it from her hand. âI caught it, and tho' death had been my lot âHad I been taken, I escaped that night; âWhen travelling with all speed, I found thee here, âAnd here I yield my charge, fulfilling thus, âTo that most peerless maid, my solemn plight.â Llewellyn cried, âI thank thee. Here remain. âI will not bid thee serve against thy Prince, âBut when the wars are o'er, a noble lot, âShall be thy heritage. Now, further, say, âWho is this Talbot, and what name, around, âBears he, for honor, worth, and courtesy.â The man replied, âHe is a valourous knight, â(So of himself he says, I know it not,) âWho oft hath won the prize in tournament, âWith many a lady fair applauding round. âIf all he says be true, stoutly averr'd, âI trow, familiar with the joust and tilt, âNo braver knight, unwedded, at this hour, âSeeks woman's smiles, but of these boasted feats, âSome hold suspicions. When, in doleful mood, âAt th' castle gateway, Eleanor arrived, âConducted by Earl Warwick, far renown'd, âI heard him to his Squire, slow whispering say,â âThe fairest maid in Christendom!â âEnough!â Llewellyn cried. âRetire! I thank thee much. âI will talk further, at convenient time, âOn this same business. Leave me now awhile!â The man withdrew, when thus Llewellyn spake. âWalwyn and Anarawd, at hour like this, âI need good counsel. In my mind hath risen, âA thought, that, ere I call it wise or bold, âYou first shall sanction. I have even resolved, â(If on reflection meet it shall be found) âSince there is no faint chance of amity â'Tween me and Edward, with convenient force, âTo march to Gloster, seize my promised bride, âAnd bear her off triumphant. She hath told âOf her âtumultuous fearâ and mourn'd the loss âOf friend to succour her. Beneath these words, âHaply, deep meaning lies. Pride of my heart! âWhile Cambria's Prince, wields this his father's sword, âShall Eleanor be friendless? To this spot, âDoubtless I may return, ere Snowdon need âLlewellyn's presence, else, let love, such love âAs I have felt, whelm'd in forgetfulness, âPerish for ever. If objection rise âWalwyn speak out. Save Vychan, thy old sire, âNone heed I more.â The Chieftain thus replied. âO Prince, with thee I sorrow, yet as truth âThou lov'st, the thoughts which from the heart proceed, âI would advise thee, to restrain thy wrath. âIf possible, forget the captive maid, âTill, to his King, the Prelate back returns. âAt such a time, descend not from the tower, âWhere now thou stand'st, nor give to Edward's cause, âStrength, by the step of rashness. I may err, âYet what I feel, my spirit dares to speak.â Llewellyn cried, âbrave Anarawd, declare, âIn this perplexing hour, what thoughts are thine.â The Chieftain answer'd âThrice ten thousand men âNow wait thy word. Edward, at distance bay'd âBy many a castle, hath large work to do, âEre he call forth Llewellyn's potency. âTo the destruction of this citadel, âObjection there is none. A valiant deed; âDistracting Edward; teaching him again, âThe oft-repeated lesson, that thy sword, âStrikes east and westâthus mayst thou serve alike âBoth love and duty. Peace, must Cambria gain âBy the sword's edge alone. This argument, âMay bear conviction to our enemy, âAll others are but tame. The Bishop's voice!â âMore efficacious is the gentlest breeze âT' uproot the oak, than such mild monitors âTo stem th' impetuous Edward in his course. âThe sword, the spear, the buckler, we, in these, âBehold our confidence.â Llewellyn cried, âWell hast thou spoken, Anarawd, thy thoughts, â(With no discourtesy to this our friend âStill prized, tho' young in years, in wisdom sage) âTruly were mine, yet in a point so nice, âWhen reason's door so strongly was beset âBy inclination, my own sentiments âI doubted, till I heard some valourous man, âFor wisdom famed, confirm my half resolve. âNot e'en an hour shall loiter: speed ye fast, âConvene my chiefs! instant, I follow you.â Surrounded by his warriors, brave and bold, Llewellyn now appear'd; thus he began. âFriends, I require your presence, to declare âOur future plans, and counsels. Hear, O Chiefs! âWhilst Edward, fearful to invade our land, âPauses upon the frontier, knowing well âThunder the lightning follows, we will speed âToward Gloster, hold abhorr'd! which long hath braved âOur hottest vengeance, and which now shall fall, âIf in Llewellyn's oath be verity. âOne half shall guard the bulwark of the land âThe other half of Cambria's men in arms âShall join their Prince. Soon as the dawn unfolds, âOur march begins.â âWhen Leolin understood that his Mistress was taken from him by the way as she was coming, he was not a little wrath, and incontinentlie began to make warre upon King Edward's subjects, that bordered neere unto Wales.ââHolinshed. Joy, universal joy Shone in each warrior's face and forth they turn, For the next morn, each to prepare himself. BOOK V. SCENE, David's Castle, in Gwyned. âEdwall, thy words are vain.â David exclaim'd. âMy purposes are ripen'd. Thou shalt find âThat Griffith's son, like the most patient beast, âWas never form'd for burdens and hard stripes. âMy object is a Crown!â âStay!â Edwall cried. âLook not so high! There is temerity, âAnd danger infinite, ere thou approach âThat giddy height. David, my noble Prince, âIf words most kind, and faithfulness most true, âEven from the tender years of infancy, âCan witness friendship, am I not thy friend?â âI know it, Edwall!â David cried. âThy life âHath been a tablet, on the which are traced, âLines fair, and of so sweet a character, âThat when my eyes are weary of mankind, âTheir idle forms, and senseless gayeties, âTo thee I turn, and a refreshment find, âLike what the Seaman feels, when he beholds, âAfter a perilous and lonely course, âSome fair and fragrant isle, rising serene, âAmid the boundless sea. Doubt not my love. âThou art a friend of most established zeal âAnd precious value, this my heart confirms.â âIf then a friend, I am, hear me I pray. âThy soul to Cambria's sceptre doth aspire! âTo hurl, from his usurped eminence, â(These are thy words) Llewellyn, our brave Prince, âAnd thy good brother. Stay that daring thought! âIt is a stone, beneath which pestilence âLies sleeping, yea perdition, and the storm âBrother of death. Let it alone; disturb âThe drowsy Basilisk, but let this stoneâ âFor ever sleep! âOf old, there was a man, âFair in his youth, for whom a thousand prayers âDaily arose; a thousand shields combin'd âTheir sleepless vigilance to guard from harm âHis nightly slumbers, and when, now, at length, âHe stood mature in manhood, every tongue âConfess'd him like to fabled deities, âSo spotless, and of port so consummate âOf earthly excellence. He stood alone. âThe regal designation of his brow âAwed the beholder. Matchless strength was his, âAnd such his stable chest and nerve of brass, âThat the appointed times, suited to man, âSeem'd changed, and perpetuity of health, âDoom'd to attend, by nature's courtesy, âThis pride of the terraqueous earth we tread. âLong had he flourish'd, great in warlike deeds, âWhose foes beheld the shadow of his spear, âTrembling, and fled: but now, O woe to tell! âHis children in rebellion and fierce strife âRose on their parentâscorn'd their filial debt: âAnd tho' the citadel dared all without, âCorruption grew within; when the good man, âWearied with grief, oppress'd, disconsolate, âAt his unnatural children, droop'd his head! âHis locks turn'd grey! A premature old age âHung weighty on him, yea, he gasps for breath! âAh, David! Do I see thy changing face? âDost thou perceive that this old tottering man, âIs Cambria, the dear father of us all? âLet the warm feelings of thy heart return! âWilt thou, in such a moment, lift thy hand âAgainst thy parent? David, wilt thou draw âThe long deep bow, in hour like this, and twang â(Untrembling round the confines of thy heart) âThe fatal string!â âEdwall!â the Prince exclaimed, âTalk not with such momentous air and tone. âThere is a strange and preternatural look âIn this thy visage, and thy very voice âHath character obscure. I like it not. âHear me, my words are plain. âThis Prince of thine, âBrother, I call him not, in his huge grasp, âHath seized my Father's all. Tho' elder born, âHath he more royal blood, straining his veins, âThan David?âCourage more austere and tried, âLimbs firmer to endure the battle's brunt, âOr heart that beats with higher purposes? âThou know'st he has not! Yet, my Father dead, âLlewellyn seized his kingdom and his crown. âMistake thou not the motive of my heart,â âI hate ambition, 'tis the bane of man. âI have no rule, even I! dominion none âTo greet its master, save this one poor tower, âThis castle, and its hunger-fed domain, âPoor pittance for a Prince. Yet, tho' the thought âSends torture to my heart, I heed it not. ââGreat in adversity,â my motto this. âI can endure the scorpion scourge, and smile âAt my tormentors, yet, this heart of mine âWas never form'd with a low cringing look, âObeisant, to behold, in lordly state, âStrutting and proud Superiority. âMine is no second hill, when the sun shines âBuried in shadows. I must look about, âYea, down, upon the crags, lifting their heads âAround my base, and tho' the wintry storm âAssail me, and the furious tempest roarâ âThere is a music in the warring winds! âNo answer! I have other words in store. âEven the beasts of earth have learn'd my shame. âAs near him I pass by, the very bull âLooks with indifference on me; raises up âHis lazy head, then browses the rank grass, âForgetting what he sawâso mean am I, âWho should have been, a Lord, a Potentate. âEdwall! if thou hast felt, till this good hour, âAught in thy heart, of kindness for thy friend, âNot knowing his plain, naked characterâ âCorrect thyself! Re-model thy conceits, âAnd view me as I am! Know then assured, âMy dart is hurl'd at the sun-gazing bird. âThe lion is my prey. My feet were made âFor paths of peril, and competitors âThat move the earth alone have charms for me. âBut I am scorn'd of all, dust ere I die.â âA forest leaf that flutters to the breeze, âAmid the multitude, extinguished, lost. âWas David form'd for such community âOf spirits sordid?âwhich no eye attractsâ âNo heart applauds? My soul but vegetates, âNot lives, deprived of its true nutrimentâ âThe whirl and vortex of authority. âAmongst the many foremost I must stand. âI must ascend and breathe the mountain gale. âThe valley hath its sweets for common minds, âBut the proud brow of Atlas is my home!â âTho' cowards quake, and feebleness cry, âhold!â âI'll burst the gates of brass, and force my way, âTo fame and power, thro' rocks of adamant.â Edwall replied. âDavid I must be heard! âWhence this tumultuous storm? Thee I revere âFor many virtues, tarnish not the whole âWith this huge vice, this high and towering gaze, âThis lofty aspiration. CÃ¦sar like, âNo second man art thou, mark CÃ¦sar's fall! âNor think true greatness, only pinnacled âOn power supremeâto stoop where duty calls, âTo curb Ambition's ravenous appetite, âHath more of real grandeur, than to wade âThro' seas of blood, yea, even to obtain âThe proudest empire man e'er call'd his own. âI do conjure thee, David, my tried friend, âBy all the mutual and kind offices, âWhich we so oft have shewn, to curb thy soul, âMad with imagined trammels, and display, âObedience to thy just and lawful Prince.â âDart not that look of scorn and contumely. âThou know'st the timesâthat over Cambria lours âA most foreboding cloud. Edward, that prince âRenown'd thro' Christendom, now hovers near, âHis falchion lifted, meditating death. âNay, at this hour, haply his dogs of war âMay chace our brethren, calling on all arms âFor vengeance. Hear me patiently, brave Prince. âLlewellyn, faithful to his character, âEncamps near Snowdon, round him heroes throng, âNumerous as brave. Late, 'mid his warlike chiefs, âI heard him call for thee, with wonder fill'd âThat in an hour so perilous, thy front âGraced not the field. Advancing from the crowd, âI pledg'd myself, my spotless loyalty, âThat thou wast true, yea at that very hour âThat thou wast acting the brave Briton's part, âCollecting the stout bands, and that thy flag âEre long would wave defiance at the Foe. âThe days pass'd on. I ponder'd on the cause âWhich kept thy noble spirit from the field; âTill, as my crowded thoughts, importunate, âShaped many things, some half discouraging, âWith tempest-like precipitance, I left âOld Snowdon's base, to find, where'er his haunt, âDavid, my lingering Prince. Here now thou art, âThrow off that scowl, unnatural, from thy brow. âThy soul was once the seat of generous thoughts, âLet not thy lengthen'd intercourse with men âBlunt thy best feelings; let not growing years âMake callous thy mild heart, as time doth oft âThe tender stone, raised from its parent bed.â âForget the fluttering blade when tempests rave, âAnd haste with me, intent and resolute, âTo do such deeds as Cambria long may praise.â David indignant cried, âDid thy proud Prince âDeign to inquire for one, abject and low, âWhom in his soul, spite of his specious words, âHe doth despise? I know Llewellyn's heart. âHis lordly eye, familiar to my mind, âE'en in the still and blackest shades of night, âGazes incessant on me, and his words, âSo picturing well the lofty Potentate, âSound in mine cars, e'en in my very dreams, âLike the monotonous dull waterfall. âAway ambiguous and half-utter'd speech, âI hate him!â Edwall cried, âO Prince, forbear! âThese are the fumes of a distemper'd mind, âA jaundice which o'er all Llewellyn does, âCasts a false shade. Altho' no title mine, âI have some skill to judge of character, âUnravelling in nice intertexture, minds, âThwarted and sore. David, believe thy friend! âThou hast a heart towering as Lucifer. âPride revels there, ambition, thirst of power, âPre-eminent. These Demons in thy breast âHave wrought a tempest. Rather than remain âSecond in Cambria, with a baneful grasp âThou wouldst pull down all venerable things, â(Remorseless, tranquil 'mid the storm of death,) âAnd in one wreck bury thy name and race. âThou art a piteous man! Occurrences, â(To the due-pois'd and well-attemper'd mind) âSmall and most innocent, that, atoms like, âFloating in air, light on us unperceived, âRouse up thy wild-wing's passions to a storm. âThy spirit, in the hour of gall, converts âAll things to poison, with strange aptitude, âAnd most perverse and hollow semblances âOf injured verity. Once more appear âIn thine own true and proper character, âSuch as I knew thee once, guileless and frank, âFruitful in all ennobling purposes, âThy father's pride, thy country's hope, and loved âBy one whose heart still hovers round his friend. âThy brother reigns o'er Cambria, nor, than his, âLives there a heart endued with princelier gifts. âOwn then his virtues; stoop to his command; âSo shall thy peace return, and thy good fame âUnsullied shine, whilst all shall honor thee, âNext to thy rightful Prince.â David exclaim'd, âAway! The jargon aptness of thy tongue, âMoves my derision! O, forgive my words! âThou art the last of men, to whom my speech âWould do dishonor. Edwall, from my heart, âI prize thee, but the man whose sudden bound âLeap'd on the seat, which I had seen and felt âAnd call'd my own, thus hurling to the dirt, âE'en to the abject mire, this head, this name, âOr else illustrious 'mid earth's potentates, âI from my deepest soul do execrate!â âStop!â Edwall cried. âCan this be David's voice? âWhat words are these of burning contumely? âThy Brother hate! thy Brother execrate! âO tear the dark obtruder from thy breast. âWhate'er thou might'st desire of eminence, âIn thine uncouth, disdainful spirit high, âIs not Llewellyn, just and lawful Prince âOf ancient Cambria? This thou knowest well; âThen wherefore such rebellious and strange hate? âPause! for another step is leagued with death! âShould'st thou even gain the summit of thy hopes, âWading thro' blood, and on Llewellyn's neck, âTrample, to spring to thine imperial seat, âThou wouldst arise, not like the lord of day, âCircled with glory; thou wouldst be the moon, âPale, cloudless, and in doleful garb attired, âThat never homage forced, from the rapt heart. âThou callest me thy friend. A friend is he âWho deals in truth, naked, nor shuns to speak âWords that ill suit the hollow sycophant. âNow, let me ask thee, in a sun-beam phrase, âAnd give me answer, clear and manifest. âAt this portentous hour, what path is thine? âThou know'st that Cambria totters, that her foe âIs sworn to her destruction and now lifts âThe blazing spear. Wilt thou thy country serve, âOr 'mid the harvest, whilst ten thousand swords âReap honor and imperishable praise, âTurn to the den of shame, and bury there, âThe pearl which should have purchased high renown?â David exclaim'd. âEdwall, I tell thee not! âWhat if it pleased my mind, that never yet âTo mortal stood accountable, that I,â âEven I, should join the standard of the foe! âWhat wouldst thou say to that?â Edwall replied. âThis would I say. Tho' I have call'd thee dear, âYea oft have pledg'd my honor and my life, âOn thine allegiance, shouldst thou turn thy face âFrom Cambria, and e'en look upon the foe, âEach drop of my heart's blood would loathe thy name! âThy very wife, thy children, rising now âIn youth's luxuriance, at their recreant sire âWould scoff, and, 'mid the hootings of the crowd, âLift their shrill voices.â David, trembling, cried. âI said it not. Do not mistake my words. âNo! Edwall, no! My wife! my beauteous boys! âI will not wrong you! never shall ye say âMy traitorous father plunged me in disgrace! âEdwall! my troubled mind seeks solitudeâ âA transient respite; more, I cannot say. âNow leave me, my best friend! a little space, âAnd by thy side, I will fight valiantly.â They part, and each the other bids farewell. BOOK VI. SCENE, Gloster Castle. In Gloster's frowning castle, by thy side, O Severn! the forsaken Eleanor Pass'd wearily her hours; far from her friends, Her mother, and that flower of potentates, Llewellyn, Cambria's Prince, whose matchless worth Her lips had own'd, and often testified By looks of love, clearer than doubtful words, The testimonial heart conveys to heart. Here, pensively, she dwelt, sad and alone, Estranged from joy, and if the truant, hope, Excursive, to his fair abode return'd, She blamed him, as a faithless wanderer, And bade him seek some yet uncheated mind. Till now her days had past, gay as the lark, Breathing the mountain air, whilst Liberty, The smiling maid, ever beside her stood; Two Sisters they, where grace supernal sat, Their tresses wild, their sky-blue roving eyes, Glistening like midnight star, seen thro' the trees, Just yielding the green bud, and their fair cheek Crowded with roses: doom'd at length to part, One on the bleak hill sits disconsolate, The other seized by the rude hand of war, 'Mid grated bars and turrets grey with time, Counts the slow-pacing hours, and wearily, Endures the memory of departed joys. What sorrow pierced the friendless Eleanor, When first she found herself, 'mid Gloster's towers; Compass'd, with strange and hollow-sounding domes, Harsh doors, and murmurs rude of roving winds, Or whispers, utter'd slow, faintly perceived By the attentive ear, each rousing up Ideal, tho' intolerable fears. The high tower bell gave forth the dead of night, But sleep to Eleanor no visit paid. Her Page, retiring, at the evening hour, Bade her God's blessing; in her heart she cried, Thank thee! but not a word she spake. The lamp Waving its languid flame, silent she watch'd, And felt her heart prone to idolatry; Save the protecting power of Heaven on high, It was her only friend, but for whose smiles Darkness had come, arm'd with hell's progeny. The lambent glories of that social star Cheer'd her, a little space, and solaced her, With images far off, of joy and peace, Till some strange sound along the vaulted roof, Or in near passage, call'd her roving mind, Back to its post, whilst, shuddering she turn'd round, And cast a wilder'd glance, toward dark recess, Or arras, worm destroy'd, hollow within, The seat of freezing fears. Silence, again, O'er all things stole, till now the Sentinel Pacing his nightly round, rose on her ear, Faint, till beneath the window, his firm step Made the ground tremble, dying then away, And leaving her to silence, and the dread Of some new-starting terror and amaze. What joy rush'd flood-like, thro' the maiden's heart, When she beheld the first grey cloud arise, Amid the east. It seem'd the airy form, Of her Protecting Spirit, drawing near Thro' darkness and impenetrable skies, With ardent pace, to rescue her from death. The joy arising from the breaking of the morning has seldom been felt in a greater degree, than it was on the following occasion:â About a hundred sail of vessels proceeded from England for the West Indies in the August of 1809. Their course for some time was favorable, and all on board with undoubting confidence anticipated a prosperous voyage. One evening the sun descended with a yellow lustre. The air was mild, the wind fair, and every heart experienced felicity on beholding the regular progress of so large a fleet, all securely and tranquilly forcing their way through the illuminated and playful billows. One vessel in particular, a large and new ship, all eyes surveyed with admiration. The distant seamen recognised her as the âpride of the fleetâ; as sailing on âlike a Commodore.â At length the dark clouds of an encumbered sky concealed all objects from the sight. In the midst of darkness, a storm came on, without warning, as severe as ever visited poor mariners on the shelterless sea. In a moment, a gush of the elements laid one vessel (from the Captain of which this account was received) permanently on her side. For one hour and a half, in this perilous state she lay, her sails level with the water, darkness on every side, whilst the still-augmented roaring of the winds and the waves told every heart that its hour was near. In the midst of such convictions, âa speck of lightâ arose in the east, like a gem set in a sky of ebony. It was the first dawn of the morning! In the face of death, hope kindled afresh. Encouraged by the imperfect glimmering, which many would still have called night, the reviving crew, zealously advanced to cut away the masts, which when accomplished, the vessel righted. The winds now gradually subsided, and when the morning appeared, with heart-rending dismay, they saw the white heads of the huge billows strewed with wrecks! Of this gallant fleet, eleven ships, including her which was âthe pride of the fleet,â which sailed on like a Commodore,â all perished utterly, in this night of horrors! Now as the morn advanced, clouds, gathering fast, Of fair effulgence, their concenter'd blaze Spread all around, and now the buoyant sun Slow rises, shaking from his dewy locks Resplendent streams, till the wide firmament, Endures no more of glory and bright rays, Ineffable.âOf disappointed hopes, And prospects blasted, this transcendent sight Cheated the pensive prisoner; here she turn'dâ From thoughts that harrow'd up her soul, to view The day's proud potentate, gliding serene, With all his gorgeous company of clouds, Thro' the blue ether, and now stooping down, To the bright western verge of heaven's gate, Thro' whose red portals, myriads, seem'd to rush, Of blessed spirits, deck'd with wings of fire, Sailing on floods of gold, and with their shouts, (Silent to mortals) after his hard course, Hailing the Royal Charioteer, august, That left each rash competitor behind. Another day is past, another still And the long dreary night, rousing afresh All terrible dismays. O Eleanor! Unhappy maid, mournful as thus thou wast, Far from thy friends, and robb'd of the bright crown, Gay fancy wove, than rainbow hues more fair, Just at the moment when upon thy brow Love smiling placed it, thou hadst deeper cares! Fresh sorrows now were thine, piercing thy heart. Talbot, in Gloster's towers who ruled supreme, Lived lawless, heeding neither God nor man. His vassals fear'd him as a lion fierce. The Abbot in his hospitable hall Trembled as he drew near, and his rude train; Hospitality was the most beautiful feature of the Monastic Institution. The pilgrim and the traveller, after toiling all day, felt consolation in the thought, that, on arriving at the Abbey, he would be welcomed with rest and refreshment. Adequate sums were always appropriated, expressly, for these purposes, and in the absence of Inne, Monasteries formed an excellent and a gratuitous substitute. This disposition to relieve all who came, originated in a benevolent feeling towards the suffering and the destitute, but as an universal custom admitted of no restrictions, men of ample fortunes and large retinues availed themselves of the privilege, and often by their long stay and boisterous behaviour became serious evils in such religious establishments. Earl Talbot is represented as one of these unreasonable visitors. Newcome, in his history of St. Alban's Abbey, speaks of Geoffery de Leizine, (half brother to Henry the Third) who âcame to this Abbey, and, together with his attendants and horses, occupied the whole Monastery, and, during his stay, utterly subverted the order, regularity, and solemnity of the place. The strangers' stable, which would hold three hundred horses, without inconvenience, did not suffice this riotous Prince's retinue.â The motley group often to have been found in the kitchen and parlour of a monastery, has not been made enough of either by the poet or the painter. While never anxious friend turn'd from his road To ask his welfare. Never, at his gate, The beggar stood and smiled, nor pilgrim saint, Bare-footed, hastening to some holy shrine, By the road side, bless'd him, as forth he went To join the hunters. Never orphan's tear Thank'd him, with silent eloquence, whilst none Ere heard the widow, benedictions pour Upon his head, but ever, where he pass'd Curses close follow'd him, whilst every eye A dagger's point display'd. When Warwick's Earl, To Gloster, with the lovely Eleanor, Came on his journey, as the Castle gate She enter'd, in his heart, impure as false, Talbot conceived a passion strong as death. He heard of her misfortunes, saw her tears, And in his spirit laugh'd. Warwick now rose To seek the King, and bear the captive Maid Toward Chester, (where th' impatient monarch sat, Waiting th' assembly of his warrior host.) âStop!â Talbot cried. âWarwick, victorious Earl! âHear my advice. Lead not the Maiden hence. âThou dost revere De Montford's captive child. âHer beauty and her sorrows, well might move, âA rock to pity her. Wouldst thou inflict âA deeper wound in breast so pure as her's, âAnd ten-fold aggravate, her suffering heart?â âWhat mean'st thou?â Warwick spake. Talbot replied. âHear me, brave friend. Silent as death, keep thou âThe words I utter. Fame hath doubtless told, âOftimes, to thy revolting ears, the vice âWhich sways our Edward, how his feverish breast âTakes fire at beautyâmore I need not say. âPoor Eleanor! She hath already borne âHer share of sorrow. In thy generous mind âSpare her this last misfortune and disgrace.â Awhile, in doubtful state Warwick remained. He look'd at Talbot, then revolved afresh âOn the propounded thought.â Thus he replied, Whilst something of resentment fired his eye. âEarl! thou hast erred. Our Prince thou little know'st. âNo roving mind is Edward's. To his Queen âHe is pre-eminent in faithfulness: âOf conjugal affection, the proud mark âTo which the pious father, round the board, âThrong'd with his offspring, points, and fortifies âTo efficacious good and high resolves âTheir young perceptions, by extolling loud âThe virtues of their King;âexemplar fair âOf excellence, thrice heighten'd, by the foil âOf the incontinence, which like a flood, âIn this degenerate and ungracious age, âBears down his courtiers and his parasites. âThou hast done wrong to Edward our brave King, âYet, doubtful where to place the captive maid, âHere will I leave her, whilst I seek our Prince, âAnd bear the death-flag thro' the Cambrian land. âHear me, good Earl. A lofty trust is thine. âPreserve her as a sacred pledge. Ere long âAnd I shall ask the Maiden at thy hand, âSpotless as is the snow-drop of the morn.â Talbot replied, âBaron of high renown, âAs dragon fierce, her will I guard from harm, âWarding all danger, like a valiant knight. âI laud thy purpose, leave her with this sword, âPotent protector.â Warwick, bending, cried, âNow fare thee well.â When, on his prancing steed, He sped toward Chester with his valiant host. As the last lance sunk slow behind the hill, Talbot exclaim'd, âNow is the field my own!â He hasten'd toward the Maid. Conscience! thou judge Of mortal actions, holding scrutiny Most strict, and troubling, on his lofty throne, The monarch, or, amid his crumbling cot, With like severity, the meanest slave:â When came thy voice, arm'd with more sovereignty, Than now to Talbot? He, whose dauntless mind, One moment past, hurl'd a defiance fierce On obstacles, altho' they cross'd his road, Towering as Andes, now dismay'd appears, And rolls his vacant eye-balls o'er the ground. He knew that he his fierce desires must curb, Or (the false knight) sink deep in infamy. Even the arguments, dictated first By foul hypocrisy, now, on his mind, Recoil, and bear substantial characters, Forms well defined, like th' aspiring sun Stripp'd of his morning mists. He hears a voice To silence close allied, a still small voice That pleads the cause of one, over whose head Nature had cast the loveliest of all veils, Even Modesty, kin to celestial charms. Forced by necessity, secret, supreme, His spirit now revolves on Eleanor, Friend, parent, and protector, far away. He had a daughter once, to death gone down, And whilst her image darted thro' his mind, Talbot's stern heart, felt rising tenderness, Allied to pity, towards th' imprisoned Maid. Worship the feeling! Listen to that voice, Tho' thunders roar! It is the blessed call Of blessed spirits, urging thee from death. Fly at the summons! Thrice the rolling sun Pass'd over him, while hostile thought met thought, And vice and virtue paus'd, doubting who first Might gain ascendanceâLo! the choice is made! The strife is over! Boiling thro' his veins Passion returnsâthat subtile advocate, When the soft pleading words and urgent strains Conscience sent forth, vanish. The vision fades, So late that charm'd, the pitying heart is still. Now a new foe, burst on his harass'd mind. (The Colleague, Conscience often calls upon.) Fear upward starts; when Talbot earnest spake. âI little know what lurking and dark train âMay follow this, the current of my will! âDanger is near! Cautious must be my steps! âThe ground is hollow! Tho' I pledg'd my word, âAnd know disgrace, upon my treachery, âWill follow hard, yet these are little thingsâ âFoes long disdain'd, whose feeble blows have fallen âOft on my shoulders; but, bold Warwick's wrath, âAnd his the better cause, that moves my heart.â As doubtful thus he stood, loud he exclaim'd (By th' Power Malign inspired, who finds access Easy, to the corrupt and evil heart) âWherefore should Talbot dread a mortal's frown? âWarwick! and who is he? He to the wars âHath bent his footstep. Never from that scene âThick strew'd with graves, where voluntary fools âBury themselves, will he return to ask âThe pledge I gave him. Nay, the deed, which late âShot horror thro' my veins, to this mine eye, âLooking thro' purer medium and clear skies, âAppears most merciful. The hapless maid, âCast on the world's bleak shore, houseless and sad, âWith disappointed hopes, looks eager round âFor friendly shelter. When to her, I tell âThe love I bear, and my devotedness âTo her transcendent worth, the prize is won. âI know too much of nature's ministry âTo question it, the workings of the soul, âThe fissures thro' which human thoughts ascend. âIf I have skill, undoubted till this hour, âList'ning to what I say, she will exult;â âAnd joy dispel each doubt that troubled her. âHe said and hasten'd where the Maid abode. âFarewell, brave Earl! good Angels succour thee!â These were the words, which Eleanor pronounced, As Warwick left her. Now to her sad mind His speech return'd, his knight-like courtesy, And half unconscious, thus again she cried, âBravest of Foes, good Angels succour thee!â When Talbot enter'd. With a majesty That awed his heart, the Maid arose and cried. âEarl! wherefore here? Respect thyself and me!â Talbot, with cautious step moved slowly on. Near Eleanor he drew, when, on the ground, Kneeling, his evil speech he thus preferr'd. âBrave, but no Foe! and for that prayer of thine, âThinking of TalbotââAngels succour thee!â âMy heart sustains the boundless gratitude. âSweet Maid! thou need'st not urge me to respect; âI do respect thee, 'bove all human forms, âBearing the name of women. Gentle Maid, âPardon thy suppliant! Should he talk of love, âHear him propitious!â Eleanor, (her eye Fire darting, whilst th' indignant blush arose) Thus answer made. âBaron, insult me not! âA fatal rock is near! a precipice! âThou standest on the verge! Stay not to think, âBut fly! Impetuous fly! Forsake this spot, âSacred. Away!â The colour from her cheek Changed deadly pale, when Talbot thus replied. âTranscendent Damsel! kin to heavenly forms! âIndulge not in thine heart injurious thoughts âOf Talbot's honor: I am here this day âTo tender thee, terms not to be disdain'd; âAn offer, many a fair and noble dame, âWould hear rejoicing. From the first faint glance, âWhen thro' my castle gate thou enteredst here, âI loved thee and exclaim'd, striking my breast, âYon maiden must ere long, bear Talbot's name. âScorn not thy suitor. Lo! the Priest at hand; âThou art, thou shalt be mine!â Thus Eleanor, With port august, assuming a fix'd frown, Bespake the Baron. (Such a look was her's, That he who late was bold, e'en like a child, Now stood, and felt the soul irresolute.) âTalbot! if pride of ancestry be thine, âIf in thy veins heroic valour flows, âAnd thou dost heed posterity's stern voice, âBlasting th' uncourteous knight, haste from this spot! âThe air thou breath'st is pestilent to fame! Her firm repulse, her fix'd unbending air, Majestic, chain'd his rebel tongue. Ere this Tho' oft abased, never, till now, he felt His abject littleness. He saw his name, Tarnished with treachery, and wish'd himself, Far off, a thousand leagues. At length he turn'd, Speechless, o'erwhelm'd with thought of baffled hope, And shrank away, before the dignity Unspeakable, of woman's searching frown. From the bright blaze of virtue's sun escaped, Talbot rejoicing stood. The maiden's look Still haunted him. He mutter'd curses dire, Then pleasure felt, that not an eye beheld The deep red crimson of his burning cheek. Wounding afresh, now to his mind arose The words which, with an oath's solemnity, He spake to Warwick; and tho' used to deeds Which made the vault of hell, echo with shouts, This immature unconsummated hope, So scorn'd of every good and gallant knight, Fill'd him with black remorse and deep self hate, Not from contrition, but remembered shame Unbless'd of day, that perish'd in the bud. Thick clouds, o'er the horizon of his mind, Fast gathering, cast a deep mysterious gloom. Conscience, so often wounded with rude hand, Preserved her righteous calendar of crimes, And fill'd his mind with apprehensions, faint, Tho' permanent, of thread-suspended weights, With crushing violence, sometime to fall, He knew not when. The deeds which were pass'd by, Now, angry, rose, each bristling up a sting, That made him groan. âWarwick,â cried he, âwill hear âOf my designs, thus faithless, he whose name âMakes kingdoms tremble. Eleanor herself, âDaughter of Leicester, that once powerful Earl, âHigh in renown, will also on my head âBring down perdition. Many a knight would spur âHis head-strong steed, toward one discourteous. âI have betray'd an honorable trust. âI am undone.âSome humbler victory, âI should have coveted, where heaven alone âTakes cognizance! but now the dam is burst; âThe waters of destruction roar around.â Talbot with dread beheld the hour of eve. Uneasy was his pillow. Waning night Linger'd along, and many a deep-drawn sigh, Sent forth in darkness, told a bitter tale, And made him covet the unbroken rest Of him, with heart at ease, slumbering sereneâ The Hind who in his crazy cot reclines. Before the morning dawn'd his restless soul, Sought comfort from the walk, lonely and still. O evil man! that with a down-cast brow Own'st thy transgressions, and when truth breaks forth Upon thy mind, in momentary gleam, Hailest the visitant, and vowest oft To turn no more to folly and dark ways, How brief thy pungent sorrows and resolves! Thou hast no Principle, on which to rear The stately structure, where in pomp, abides Virtue, that heavenly maid, therefore art thou The sport of every passion, like the reed, Obedient to all impress from without. Each billow laughs at thine inconstancy. Talbot, who saw his shield, (so late assumed,) Talbot's paternal arms, were, âBend of ten pieces argent and gules,â but his father having married Guendoline, the daughter of âRhys ap Griffith,â Prince of Wales, Earl Talbot renounced his family arms, and adopted those of Rhys, âLion rampant or, in a field gules, with a border engrailed of the first.â Transform'd to black or the degenerate brown, The colours orange and murrey (or brown) called, in heraldry, tenne and sanquin, were considered as disreputable, and if the bearer of a shield entitled to any of the superior colours, fell into disgrace, he was sometimes compelled to adopt in his arms one of the above disho nourable colours: a punishment almost as severe as that of turning a Knight's coat, of which some curious examples occurred in the fourteenth century. Now spurns at past dismay; even he, who, late, By shame o'erpower'd, thro' midnight shades had walk'd And combated with care, upward ascends Into a flood of lightânot such a light As th' noon of day, when Innocence walks forth, Majestic, 'neath the radiant cope of heaven; But (likening moral things to natural) The light in which he moved was twilight strange, A preternatural beam, a sickening glare Removed from light and dark,âlike what the earth, From her torn entrails sends, when from the gorge Of Hecla, or the huge Sicilian mount, She vomits forth, amid the hour of night And pitchy prime, torrents of liquid flame, Sulphureous, that o'er created forms Cast an appalling shade, and fill the hearts Of the stunn'd gazers, with divided dread; Half fearing man (stalking his lonely way Cloth'd in the hue of death, starting, aghast, At the soul-shaking conflicts of mid air,) And half believing that the infernal spirits Had burst their chains, and with an uproar wild, Forth rush'd, to seize, earth, for their heritage. Amid this doubtful light, Talbot now stood And call'd it joy, and strove to welcome it, And deem it the bright sun-shine of the morn. Scorning his timid spirit, he exclaim'd, âWhence are these hostile feelings and false fears? âAm I not Lord of Gloster's proud domain? âSupreme in power? Coward, as thus I am, âI trembled at a maiden's lowering look, âThat mildest and most transient of all storms!â âThe lion-hunter frighten'd at a fawn! âNew thoughts are mine; virtues are still in store! âI, a damp dungeon have down deep in earth âWhich tells no tales! Threats of its dark abode, âWhat heart, that loves the aspect of the sky âCould hear, unshuddering. In the evil hour âShould Warwick e'er return, claiming his charge, âShe may have died.â He said and sought the maid. She, 'mid the perilous hour, a Refuge had And a Defender, tho' unseen, even Himâ Who form'd the universe, who rules all hearts, And by a thousand avenues leads on His ministers protecting. She, to Him, Lifted her soul in th' grateful breath of prayerâ He heard, he ever hears all who him seek With spirit pure. Safe stands the lonely maid. Amid distracting fears, and hope gone by, She, with the song, solaced her weary mind. The sun is up, the air is still, The firmament is fair and glowing; All things with joy their chalice fill, And softly Severn now is flowing; But what to me can joyance bear, While bolts and prison bars surround me? Forms of delight so sweet that were, Like ghosts of long-lost friends confound me. The Captive, in a foreign clime, Who on the breeze may waft his ditty; Who chaunts, to sooth the tedious time, The song which rocks might move to pity; What are his cares compared with mine? The sad deserted Child of Sorrow! His prospects, with the morn, may shine, But I expect no glad to-morrow. The joys which once I call'd my own, Like Happy Spirits pass before me; From anguish and the ceaseless moan, Their fairy smiles again restore me; Once more the sportive maid I seem, Which late, thy groves, Montargis! found me; Till, starting from the faithless dream, A thousand terrors rise around me. Thy Daughter, best of friends and true! Couldst thou behold her, O my Mother! O couldst thou now thy Sister view, Brave Amoury, my noble Brother; Alas! withhold your grief for me, O precious names! the one, the other, I have a tear to shed for ye, My Amoury! my wretched Mother! Warwick! thy rank in fame is high, As any Knight of ancient story; Yet why didst thou on one rely, Whose breast was never fired with glory? Thou, to the wars thy course dost bend, Whilst I am here to pine and languish, Yet shall my hopes for thee ascend, In this my lonely hour of anguish. And O Llewellyn! brave as free, Above all spirits proudly soaring; Shall I forget thy cause and thee, When other gifts, devout, imploring? While 'tiring for the mortal fray, Or on thy foes vindictive pressing; My heart, O Prince! shall earnest pray That thou mayst share Heaven's choicest blessing. Earl Talbot heard the chaunt, gnashing his teeth, He enter'd, whilst his cheek with passion glow'd. As Eleanor beheld her door draw back, And Talbot saw, sternness upon his brow, Aloud she shriek'd! That sudden fit pass'd by, Her soul concenter'd all its potency, And with a fix'd, and firm, and dauntless look, Forward she came. âBaron!â she utter'd loud, âDisgrace and death are nigh!â Talbot exclaim'd, âI heard thy song. I heard thy scoffing words âDare to pronounce that even Talbot's breast ââWas never fired with glory.â If this heart âNe'er glow'd with high intent, Earth thou hast seen âVirtue extinguish'd. Thou hast nothing left âWorthy of praise. Munition there is none, âNo strength in man, no tower of eminence. âIf Talbot's sun be set, all then is dark, âRayless and pitchy night!â The Maid replied, âI named thee not. What spirit told the truth? âDid Conscience speak?â Talbot enraged exclaim'd, âHear! and believe my words are destiny! âThou art my prize. If I do yield thee up âTo mortal man, and quench my spirit bold âIn willing disappointment, break the fence, âAnd let thee 'scapeâtill sounds my funeral knell âLet the loud-laughing Knight, as I pass by, âCry âFool!â and mount me on the wing of scorn. âOne offer more is thine. Choose thou once more. âI proffer thee the honorable name âOf Talbot's wife. On this profoundly think; âLet it not pass thee, as an idle thing.â âIf on the morrow, at this very hour, âThou spurn that name, and with presumptuous pride âDisdain th' advances made by Talbot's Earl, âBy the stability of heaven, I swear, âNo second offer, parley shall be o'er, âAnd thou, too late, bewail thy contumely.â The tender tree, aspiring, that declines Slowly before the breeze, if by the storm Sudden assaulted, and by hostile might Bent downward, calls upon its dormant strength, Repels th' uncouth aggressor, feels new force, And with elastic bound, gives back its head, Majestic, in defiance of the blast. So in th' oppressed maiden's mind, till then, The seat of peace, the home of quietness, Th' occasion, strange, uproused, feelings unknown, Which gave her looks and speech, a character, Pertaining not to the sweet spirit mild, Which was herselfâthe gentle Eleanor. Firm, she exclaim'd. âTalbot! thou knew'st my Sire âDe Montford's valiant Lord, now, were he here, âHow would his slightest glanceâwither thy soul!â Man knows his strength, and Woman, too, can weep. The momentary gust of passion o'er, In Pity's mildest tone, thus she bespake. âHear me my Lord! I am betroth'd to one, âLofty in sentiment, noble in deed, âThe brave Llewellyn! Cambria's high-born Prince! âYears have roll'd on beholding us the same; âHeard our warm vows, and seen our constancy. âFrom Gallia, from Montargis' The Monastery in France, to which Eleanor De Montford fled, with her Mother, after the death of Simon De Montford, at the battle of Evesham. calm abode âAnd from a mother's wing, a Cambrian bark âSailed on, to bear me to the man I loved. âO thought of misery! O hour of dread! âNear Scilly's isles, two huge and warlike ships âCaptur'd our bark. A prisoner I became. âAt length I pass'd to Gloster. To thy hand, âConfiding in hereditary fame, âWarwick's high Earl committed me. His soul, âNor Eleanor's, wrong'd Talbot's courtesy. âThink of a hapless maid, O, pity me!â At her address, Talbot confusion felt. A barrier now arose, even in the hour And manner least foreseen. He in his pride, Had dared to think the tender'd marriage band, Offer'd by Earl, no Captive would disdain, But, like a spirit from the sandy waste, Llewellyn rose, and, with a parching blast, Wither'd the first green promise of his spring. His thoughts now marshall'd, Talbot thus began, Wielding the potent weapon Flattery. âMaiden, beloved, the tears that dim thine eye, âE'en add new grace and beauty, to a form, âThan seraph's fairer. Dost thou, serious, speak, âOf plighted vows to that degraded Prince, âBuried in shame, Llewellyn?âone whose throne âNow totters to its base? He bear the prize! âWho hath no honourable thoughtâwhose mind, âFlagrant to all, teems with deceit and fraud! âUnwittingly, maiden thy tongue hath err'd. âVows to that graceless Prince, that abject man! âBehold in me a lover and true friend, âRaised on no doubtful pinnacle of fame, âAn English Baron and who proffers thee, âEven now, a prisoner, destitute, forlorn, âThe sweets of love and deathless constancy.â Up-roused at wordsâblasting Llewellyn's fame, âTalbot!â the maid replied. (Whilst her eye flash'd Sov'reign disdain.) âWar not with fate! Away! âMy vow is past! I have no heart to give! âIt is Llewellyn's both by right and choice! âThou know'st him not. Some shape in fancy drest, âHideous, dost thou mistake for Cambria's Prince. âBaron, alike thy words, and thee, I spurn; âNor should earth's loftiest potentate that came âWith all his pageantry, thrones, diadems, âChange my fix'd purpose. Deem'st thou me forlorn, âOne destitute of all protecting powers?â âThere are, whose swords by instinct, would outleap, âBlazing destructionâin their flood of wrath, âWho would pursue thee to the extreme verge, âOf this our earth, wielding a scourge of lightning, âWert thou to rouse my spirit up in arms.â With aspect so august and terrible The maiden stood, that Talbot called to mind His clearest recognitions, to believe It still was Eleanor. At her address, Thus baffled, thus repulsed, he now assumed A frown terrific, whilst his darker heart Lower'd in his countenance. Thus he replied. âMaiden, by folly urged, thou lookest high âWith thy presumed pre-eminence of charms. âWhom dost thou serve with this rash contumely? âAm I not next to royalty? a Chief, âA Baron, peerless in renown, whose name, âFrom each stout-hearted Knight, obtains respect, âWhate'er his rank or country? yet, at length, âGreat as I am and valiant in all deeds, âA Captive scorns me. This line will remind many readers of the following Runic verses, âThe complaint of Harold,â an ancient poem, tho' not so ancient as the poems of the Two Eddas. Harold was a famous Norwegian pirate, who had penetrated as far as the Mediterranean. His song exhibits a specimen of the pursuits and habits of the Scandinavians from the seventh to the eleventh century, with much of that spirit which was afterwards sublimised into knight errantryâ âMy ship hath sailed round the isle of Sicily. Then were we all magnificent and splendid. My brown vessels, full of warriors, rapidly skimmed along the waves. Eager for the fight, I thought my sails would never slacken; and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. âI fought in my youth with the inhabitants of Drontheim. They had troops superior in number. Dreadful was the conflict. Young as I was, I left their young king dead in the fight, and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. âOne day we were but sixteen on ship board. A tempest arose and swelled the ocean. The waves filled the loaded vessel, but we diligently cleared it. Thence I formed the brightest hopes: and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. âI know how to perform eight exercises. I fight with courage. I keep a firm seat on horseback. I am skilled in swimming. I glide along the ice on skates. I excel at darting the lance. I am dexterous at the oar; and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. âWhat tender maid or widow can deny, that in the morning, when posted near the city in the south, we joined battle; can deny that I left behind me lasting monuments of my valour; and yet a Russian maiden scorns me. âI was born in the Uplands of Norway, where the inhabitants handle so well the bow. Now I make my ships (the dread of peasants) rush among the rocks of the sea. Far from the abode of men, I have ploughed the wide ocean with my vessels; and yet a Russian maiden scorns me.â Another Norwegian hero says. âI am master of nine accomplishments. I play well at chess. I know how to engrave Runic letters. I am apt at my book, and know how to handle the tools of the smith. I traverse the snow on skates of wood. I excel in shooting with the bow, and in managing the oar. I sing to the harp, and compose verses.ââDidst thou talk âOf fierce avengers, Maiden? never a knight was found âTo break Earl Talbot's lance! the tournament âHath rung his praise, and anxious and fair dames âWith more than equal smiles, sought hard to catch âThe Victor's eye, beaming complacency, âNow list, O Maid! I have a cavern deep, â'Neath these huge piles, where never ray descends, âSave drowsy torch, approach'd thro' avenues âOf ghastly aspect, and where cries and shrieks âLight not on human ears. List thou, O Maid! âThis spot shall be thy dwelling, and alone, âIts reptiles be thy consorts (hateful forms âLovers of darkness, things that bound or creep, âAbhorrent, which there thrive, their proper home) âWhilst the web-cover'd walls, scratch'd by despair, âAnd dew'd with tears, shall hear thy vain lament, âUtter'd in groans, thro' the perpetual night, âThy anguish and thy agony of dread, âTill thou confess thyself Earl Talbot's bride.â He said, and pass'd the door. Each cast a look, Lowering as midnight, wrath and stately scorn. What shout is that! The trumpet's bray is hear'd, And the confused, dull step of multitudes Each moment louder sounds.âWarwick's stout Earl! The bridge is cross'd, the gate, the spacious court. He saks for Eleanor, and now he stands, All mail'd before her. As the grating door Flew open, Eleanor, with transport, laugh'd, If laugh it were, where the full soul burst forth. She flew to her protector! On his arm, Speechless she lean'd. âWhat meaneth this!â he cried. Silence prevailed. A gushing tide of tears Told her distracted spirit, whilst the Earl Felt, in his breast, the dark suspicion rise. The tide of feeling ceas'd, âNow,â Warwick cried, âMaiden revered, unburden thy full heart.â âI am thy friend.â The Maiden harder press'd His warrior coat, but answer she had none. Time's lenient moments pass'd thus she replied. âI hail thee as a Spirit bless'd from Heayen! âO Warwick know! Talbot, that name abhorred, âDisgraces knighthood! Pity me, good Earl! âI am far off from all my tenderest friends! âNo sympathising heart, beats to my woes! âAlone, the weight of sorrow I sustain, âAnd look for death, my only antidote.â Cried Warwick, âBy the spear of chivalry, âI will befriend thee! as a brother feel! âA champion act! Now, tell me thy complaints! âMaiden! keep nothing back from Warwick's ear!â Thus Eleanor again. âOne generous friend! âKnow gallant Earl! since thou didst leave me thus, âA hopeless prisoner, Talbot, even he, âHath utter'd wrongful words, and offer'd threats, âWhich knight should never speak, nor maiden hear. âDeaf to his voice, I spurn'd him, and replied, âWith Cambria's Prince, I have exchanged my vows, âAnd constancy and Eleanor are one. âRoused into wrath, this very morn he swore, âWith fearful eye and voice, even by Heaven! âThat should I not disdain all promises, âPaid to Llewellyn, and, when morrow came, âOh! thought of agony, call him my Lord!ââ She paus'd.âThe blush, suffusing her fair cheek, Fulfill'd her tale, with Nature's eloquence! Warwick breath'd fast. No word he deign'd to speak, Resentment in his face, furnace-like glow'd. He dash'd his hand against his pendent sword, And forward rush'd to meet, Talbot's false Earl. BOOK VII. SCENE, Gloster Castle. Warwick's high name, sounded in Talbot's ear, At his approach like the death-boding owl To weak despondency. The trumpet bray'd Loud at the gate. The castle-turrets tall Gave back the sound, in echoes loud and full, Slowly receding, like the ruffled tide, 'Mid autumn, when some tree, pendent, and throng'd With fruits luxuriant, to the subject stream Drops of its load. The circle-teeming wave Spreads wider, till, at length, it dies away Into nonentity, so faint, so still. Talbot distracted stood, irresolute. A crowd of scenes, lowering and ominous, Rush'd thro' his mind, till, with thought audible, Frowning, he thus exclaim'd. âMy foe is near! âHell sends him. His Vicegerent! Satan's self, âAll vile, had been an angel to this man.â A meadow, stretching by old Severn's tide, Pondering, he sought, and there, with folded arms, Paces alone. A warrior, clad in arms, Hastens to meet the solitary Earl. Warwick draws near! Upon his brow appear'd Resentment fearful, whilst his eye sent forth Imperishable hate and mortal scorn. Talbot beheld him nigh, yet onward moved, Tho' loud and hard his rebel heart would beat. When Warwick eager cried. âThee, do I seek! âWithhold!â âAnd what of meâ Talbot exclaim'd. âHear me!â cried Warwick. âDid I not, O man! âConsign to thee (confiding in thy name, â'Mid nobles, ancient) an illustrious Maid, âDaughter of Leicester's Earl? and hast thou not âBetray'd thy trust and brought to open day âThy most plebeian spirit and false heart?â âNay,â answer'd Talbot. âBy the sword I wield, âI proffer'd her the name of wedded wife. âThis breast, so fill'd with noble purposes, âNever conceived, aught but the generous deed, âAnd thought humane. Thou wrongest me, good Earl,â Indignant, Warwick cried. âTraitor and vile! âThou wed the damsel! was she not my charge? âDid not I trust her, as a sacred pledge, âBeneath thy roof, whilst thou didst utter loud, âLauding my purpose, âLeave her with this spear, âPotent protector?â Say, O traitor Earl! âDidst thou not know (augmenting still thy crime) âThat her most solemn plight oft had been pass'd âTo Cambria's Prince? did not her own sweet words, âBlended with tears, tell, with transcendent tones âOf Angel tenderness, that solemn tale âWhere honor, in love's road, stops, and the knight, âWhose heart is manhood, takes a last fond glance âOf the fair prospect, and then turns away, âCrying, with spirit resolute, âfarewell!â âHad I beheld a point where one fond hope âMight have propell'd itself, how had I rushed âTo plant so fair a flower, of hues divine, âIn this my bosom. I, a lifted hand, âSaw, rising from the earth! I heard a voice, âMystic, yet clear, each cast a sanctity âRound Eleanor, pure as the balmy breath âOf fragrant Eden. Thou art now debased, âMore abject than the worm! In infamy, âPlunged deep, and scorn! If thou deni'st it, man! âHere is my gauntlet!â as he spake, he cast The emblem of defiance fierce on earth. In the times of chivalry, the knight who threw his gauntlet on the ground offered the challenge, he who took it up accepted it. Talbot replied. âEarl! thine accusing words, âI do pronounce are false! Not here and there âSpeckled with truth, but in the mass, all false. âDoubt not my honor. Shouldst thou thus persist âIn hurling stout defiance, I will prove âMy ancient valour and, by victory, âThis foul aspersion from the mouth of man âBlot out forever. The result of a combat, in the bad logic of our forefathers, was always admitted to refute or substantiate a charge. âWilliam D'Ow, a Norman in the reign of William Rufus, was accused of Treason, and maintaining his innocence, by single combat, was defeated, upon which, by order of the King, he was deprived of his eyes.ââCamden. Yonder gauntlet raise! âI would advise thee, with a brother's zeal, âSport not with fate! Mine is a heavy arm âAnd potent is my spear! full many a knight âHath bent before it! I, from tenderness, âSpeak thus, O Baron! dare not my assault! âDeath is my firm retainer. I, a league, âHave made, with the dread scourger of mankind. âBaron! yon gauntlet raise!â âMy truant heart!â Warwick exclaim'd! âTho' tempests rage within, âI could half laugh at thy mild sympathies, âThy woman's tenderness. Kindness for me! âDare not thy hand! if such thy real fame, âAnd such thy prowess, to the farthest verge âOf sea and earth, would I that champion seek, âTo measure sword with sword, and lance with lance. âThou, talk of Honor! Raven of jet black!â âThou boast the argent plumage of the dove? âThe very word falls, lead-like from thy tongue, âTame, spiritless. It sounds as tho' thy heart, âEven while thou spak'st, call'd it, a sturdy lie. âHear me, O Earl! Yon gauntlet, from the ground âRaise, and believe, as thou thy breath dost draw, âOur spears shall clash! Upon the coming morn âDress for the combat!â Talbot stooping down, With flexile nerve, uprais'd the harbinger Of furious fight, and to conceal the ground, Crumbling beneath, exalted the loud voice. Bloated with rage, he answer'd. âFrom the day, âWhen in the youthful tournament, I wont âTo beat to earth my young competitors, âNever hath Talbot shunn'd the proffer'd fight. âWarwick, believe! thy blood, this arm shall shed! âPast victories are cancelled if I fail âTo plunge my spear, deep in thy reeking heart! âMake thou thy testament, and know assured, âNo quarter will I grant, thy life or mine! âNo middle state. I from this spot will haste. âThe lists The name given to the rails which excluded the gazers, and to approach so near as to touch which was proclaimed punishable with death. shall be prepared; and, on the morn, âNext coming, by Heaven's hierarchy, I swear, âIn death, thou shalt bewail thy hardihood.â Warwick exclaim'd. âLike music to my ear, âSo come thy words. Th' obstructing hours will pass, âSloth-like, till 'morrow decks the sky with gold. âOne small request is mine. As I must die, âLet Eleanor survey thy victor spear.â Talbot replied, âAgreed! Too many eyes âCannot behold thy near discomfiture.â They said, when Warwick back his course pursued. Talbot, thus foil'd, in the vindictive threat, So oft his friend, in hour of jeopardy, Stood, and, with muttering tongue, curs'd Maid and Earl, Himself, trees, rivers, all which he beheldâ One deluge of rude oaths and curses dire. Of mortal men, Warwick he dreaded most, So known in tournament, so firm of heart. He cast a doubtful glance far o'er the seas, And half resolved, from the tremendous fight To flee toward Erin's land, thus saving life, Tho' all beside, mournful alternative! He yielded up, no more to be redeemed, Fame, honor, wealth, castle and proud domain. The scales are pois'd. Shame weighs the balance down. âFight him, I must!â he cried. âMade desperate, âI will put forth the vigour of this arm. âTo Erin's land (unknown of noxious thing) From time immemorial references have been made to this extraordinary circumstance, as to an indubitable fact; but one who reasons on the subject, in the absence of direct evidence, must regard the assertion, that no venomous creature will live in Ireland, as utterly unfounded It is difficult to trace vulgar prejudices to their sources, but perhaps, from the infrequency with which noxious reptiles are found in Ireland, a person originally may have expressed a belief in the opinion. This is marvellous, and as the marvellous never wants propagators, another, on the faith of his predecessor, may have gone a little further, and roundly have asserted, what before was only a conjecture, and thus the story becomes strengthened by a progressive accession of worthless evidence, till at length no one is so unpolite as to doubt what every body believes. The old legends however assign a much easier cause for this peculiarity, by affirming, that, St. Patrick, at the approach of Lent, went into a mountain in Connaught, and, that after long abstinence, to this place he collected the several tribes of serpents and venomous creatures, when, after giving them a suitable address, he drove the whole of them into the Atlantic! It is rather an unfortunate circumstance for those who espouse this sentiment, that the same story should have been propagated of the Isle of Thanet, in Kent; a privilege which it was supposed to enjoy from the virtue of St. Augustine, who, on coming over to Britain to convert the Saxons, first landed, it is said, on that island, when the whole of the poisonous brood, fled, never more to return. The assertion has long been refuted respecting Thanet, and it is an unaccountable circumstance that the evidence should be so lax respecting Ireland, as to allow any one, in the present day, to hesitate in affirming, that the whole is not more contrary to analogy than it is to fact. Giraldus (even in his time) mentions, that there was a dispute whether the Isle of Man should be regarded as naturally belonging to England or Ireland, it being about equally distant from both. It was at length however admitted to belong to England, as, upon inquiry, it was proved to contain âvenomous creatures.â âI scorn to fly. It was a luckless hour. âWell, be it so. If naught can stem his ire, âWhat Talbot's spear can do, I will display, âAnd if I dieâI have no more to dread! âI perish utterly. Futurity! âPhantom, by Bravery scorn'd, I hold thee light! âAnd who is the Most High! No watchful mind, âNo secret hand with the recording pen, âMarks Earth's delinquents, and a dread account, âFaithful, preserves, to scare, when life is past, âThe haggard spirit. Will, (to men like me,) âAlone is law. Talbot hath revell'd long âIn all earth's pleasures, and, before him, night âA long and wintry night perpetual, âLike downy sleep, that gentle sentinel â(O pleasurable thought! Balm of the soul!) âHer mantle spreads, to wrap him when he dies: âThis is my trust, and my consoling joy, âFor, what, beyond the grave, dare I to hope! âI am no advocate for faiths and creeds; âNever could I behold their arguments, âTho' I have toil'd thro' the dark labyrinth, âOft and with zeal (fce to uncertainty) âSeeking to touch firm ground. I found it not. âLet cloister'd cowls, tremble and count their fears, âI breathe a purer air, a nobler sky.â Which said he forth address'd him for the fight. The dawn appears. Without the castle walls Stately arise the lists, Fame spread the while, Near and far off, news of the coming fray, And many a trusty squire and valiant knight, And damsel fair, eager advanced to view England's two Earls strive for the mastery. Beside the spot, in canopy august, Like Hesperus, amid the stars of night, Fair Eleanor appear'd circled with forms, Lovely, whose palpitating hearts inspired The cheek of beauty, with transcendent grace, Each, earnest, waiting (with impatient gaze) The chieftain and the combat. Silence reign'd, And every thought, of countless multitudes, Dwelt on the scenes, just opening to the viewâ Of spear and horse and warrior, and the fight, Deathful and fierce, save when they cast an eye Toward Eleanor, whose virtues far had spread, And whose surpassing beauty, like a charm, Absorbed their soul. They look'd on her entranced, And spear and horse and warrior, were no more. With trumpet sounding shrill, claiming regards, A herald spake, bedizzen'd with his coat, Crowded with ensigns. âGazers!â loud he cries. âTouch not these lists, sacred, or death is near.â He scarce had ceased, when, to the eastern gate, All eyes are turn'd. The circling multitude, With general impulse, there direct their gaze, As when the Autumn corn, bending, recedes Before the breeze; no proud aspiring head Stems the broad current; all are turn'd alike. So was the general look, for at the gate, Borne by his prancing steed, glittering and gay, His beaver down, his armour shining bright, His spear up-lifted, Warwick, dauntless stands. A Herald, to the spot, speeding, exclaim'd. âStrange Knight, thy errand? What thy name and state?â The champion cried, âEarl Warwick is my name! âI come to meet Earl Talbot, him to prove âA traitor knight, unfaithful to his word, âDiscourteous, and to damsel fair, untrue. âEntrance I claim!â âBy the Evangelists,â The Herald spake, âswear thou thy words are just.â He swears; when, leaving, with his trusty Squire, His warrior steed, he enters;âhis tall spear, Poises, and to th' appointed chair, at hand, Stately, moves on. Now toward th' opposing gate, Each, earnest, looks. Earl Talbot lifts his head, High, 'mid the crowd. The Herald claims his name, And what his purpose. âI am come, he cried, âTo fight the blaster of my fame, to prove âWarwick a liar, and to feed my spear âWith his heart's blood.â He swears. He rushes in, Wielding his lance, and hastens to the chair, Near where Earl Warwick sat. The Marshall cries, âTo try their equal length and lawful form, âChampions and men at arms! hand me your spears!â Swift as the shifting shadow of the cloud, O'er some expanse of water, when the wind Wars with the elements, Talbot arose, And to the Marshall bears his massy lance. Earl Warwick follow'd, calm and confident. âHere,â Talbot spake, âMarshall! behold my spear, âSo worn in victory. If this should fail, âAnd Warwick, haply, force me to the ground, âHere is my battle-axe, trusty and true; âShould this be faithless found, to meet his blows, âHere is my sword, sheath'd oft in crimson dye! âBut should surpassing strength, rob my fierce grasp âOf this tried weapon, far a last resort, âI have one friend behind, slender, but brave, âA dagger! Here all are. View them well o'er. âA trophy, ere an hour, Talbot shall wear, âCrowning a life of fame.â Warwick replied. âMan! if thy heart be bold, as are thy words, âThou art no coward.â Turning, thus he spake. âMarshall! survey my spear. If of just form, âRestore it to its owner. Should I need âFresh weapon, in the combat, hard at hand, âMy faithful Squire, in his extremity, âWill not forget his Lord. Now for the strife.â The Marshall, to each knight, courteous, returns The barbed shaft, when Talbot thus began. âBefore the die be cast, unchangeable, âAnd parley shall be o'er, Warwick, attend. âFear hath no station in this veteran heart! âI speak from thoughts alone, friendly to thee, âHere on this field, before this noble host, âAnd in the sight of damsels, and of her âFairest of women, own thy charge untrue. âConfess thy rash and most injurious words âFounded in air, so may my spear renounce âThe oath it made, and we henceforth be friends. âShouldst thou refuse, by the celestial host, âMark me most noble Earl, my greedy lance, âBefore we part, shall teach thee, thou hast err'd. âNo second offer! Loath to take thy life, âI am importunate. Hear me, I pray!â âI hear, but heed thee not!â Warwick replied. âIf I, before yon gorgeous sun descend, âShould, to my former fame, prove recreant; âIf I should utter words, faint as the breath âOf sleeping infant, or one thought admit âThat places thee, save in the light abhorred: âIf I a faithless and discourteous knight, âShould prove thee not, down to thy heart and reins, âFalse to thy word, thy honor, and thy God, âThen plunge thy victor spear, deep in my heart! âTalbot, no more! Our parley now hath ceas'd! âMarshall, my horse!â The Marshall raised his voice! The coursers enter at th' opposing gates, Led by their Squires. The Champions mount and stand, Each, at his compeer, gazing, with an eye Of stern defiance. Warwick's neighing steed, Beheld the hostile charger, and partook His master's fire; pawing the spongy turf, And champing as he stood. His sinewy flanks Sustain'd an azure mantle, trailing low, Broider'd with antelopes, all silver bright, And mulberry wreaths, and acorns, spreading far Their moon-beam radiance. On his helm be bore, A crest, the sailing swan. His beaver down, His faithful Squire beside, his outstretch'd spear Firm in its rest, the trumpets voice he waits To meet the fray undaunted. In his front, Talbot appear'd, clad for the mortal fight. His sable charger, like the lord he bore, Stood firm in strength, his nervous chest, wide spread, Received the breath, which like a torrent rush'd Forth from his nostrils, spreading monstrous curls Thro' the chill air, and snorting, as with eye, Fiery, he gazed at th' opposing steed. Down his broad sides th' embroider'd mantle hung, Crimson, on which the rampant tyger, stretch'd Paws, reeking, and the fang emboss'd with gore, Warm from the bleeding lamb. Talbot's huge frame, Sent from his armour and his beam-like spear, Rays blazing wide, a moving mass of light. The sun-illumin'd dew-drop dark to him. His helmet in castilean furnace wrought, Burnish'd, and gemm'd with gold, soaring, august, Sustain'd the crest, terrific harmony! The roaring lion, plunging on his prey. Thus both appear'd. Their spears in order placed, Their Squires beside them. Awful was the pause. Silence prevail'd, and each of the vast host, Encircling, look'd upon the combatants. With such adhesive gaze, that the whole scene Seem'd fix'd like the abiding rocks of earth. The trumpet sounds! the prancing steeds receive, Joyful, the note of war: against their flanks The spur is driven, they rush to join in fight. Warwick's firm spear, aim'd with a master's skill, On Talbot's gorget rests. The faithful steel Denies an entrance. The diverted shaft, Beside him, wastes in air; whilst Talbot's lance 'Gainst Warwick's helmet strikes. It upward springs. The slender thong is burst. The helmet was sometimes tied loosely, to save the wearer in a charge, Several instances have occurred where the helmet was cast from the head by the lance in tilting. This was the case at a tournament in which the champions were John of Holland, on the part of the English, and Raynard de Roye, on the part of the French. The latter had laced his helmet so slightly to his armour, that when the lance of his antagonist lighted on his visor, it fell from his head and averted the injury he would otherwise have received. This was considered as an artifice which gave great offence to the English spectators, but the Duke of Lancaster who was present commended the Frenchman's dexterity, and said that âboth of them, in this matter should be permitted to do as they pleased, but added, for his part he should wish to have his helmet buckled as tight as it was possible.â The champions pass, Each harmless. Talbot, thus escaping death, Felt joy at heart. Worlds now would he have given To end the strife. In vain; fight on he must. The coward, hemm'd from flight, feels desperate. With hostile front, again the champions stand, Waiting the shrill-toned signal. Lo! it sounds! The trumpet brays! they rush again to arms! Never in tilt or tournament, appear'd, (As from their form and attitude might seem So oft the ivy hides the mouldering tree) Two high-born knights of heart more resolute, Or prowess carried nearer to the verge Of strength miraculous. Their spears are seen Firm in their rest; their bodies forward bent; Their eyes thro' grated bars, fix'd on their foe; Their legs, like pillars, stedfast; as the trump Sounded aloud, to death they urge their steeds. Against Earl Talbot's cuirass, Warwick's spear, Full furious came. The shiver'd lance upsprang High in the air, whilst Talbot's spear the while, E'en at that moment, thro' the sinewy chest Of Warwick's courser pierced, and cracking loud Drown'd his death groan. Earl Warwick, to the earth, Came headlong! having touch'd the ground, again, Ball-like rebounding, on his feet he stands. His trusty Squire the battle-axe presents, Talbot, unhorsed, a kindred weapon seized, And now, more furious, both advance to war, Blow, following blow, falls on their sturdy crests! Their armour, temper'd, like the yielding head Of some gorged snake, bursts with the massive force Of furious blows terrific. Still the fight Waxes more hot. Both given and received, Each blow, inferior chiefs, had crushed to earth. That arm of thine, O Warwick, falls like fate! Ah! Talbot, thou art wounded! Staggering back, He falls! whilst from his graspless hand, the axe Sinks, ponderous, down! O'er him stands Warwick's Earl, His weapon raised, which, but to fall, would send, Impatient of his prey, Talbot to Hell. When OcÃ©an, vex'd by the unruly winds, Breaking his slumber, lifts his lofty head, And roars, in his stupendous majesty; Thro' all the sky such soul-distracting sounds, Join'd in one general burst when Talbot fell. His menials, and his slaves, now that their voice, Amid the noise, rose indiscriminate, Even they, who daily tasted of his bread, Unbound their ample hatred, sending forth, The loudest shouts of frantic ecstasy. Talbot, from his abased bed look'd up. He saw the death-suspended battle-axe, The victor Earl, darting a look of fire; He heard the shout and curs'd the deafening sound That drown'd his prayer, ascending, tho' unheard. âMercy!â he cries. Spare thou, thy prostrate Foe! âCrown'd thus with victory, grant me my life! âSend me not instant to the land of shade! âTake all I have! I covet but my life! âMy arms, my fame, my fortune, all are thine.â His trembling hand he raised, warding the blow So soon expected. âSpare!â again he cries, âO spare my life, e'en make me evermore, âThy slave, brave Warwick, faithful, till I die.â Here ceased his words, for Warwick's massy axe The bars had beaten thro' that screen'd his face, Nor left small scar. The blood in copious stream His eager utterance choak'd; and now he lay, For strength, a feeble infant, momently Expecting his death-blow. Stretch'd on the earth, Warwick, his hand suspended, thus replied. âThis arm, full many a man, in lethel tide, âHath plunged, with head-long fury; traitors vile, âOppressive tyrants, or discourteous knights; âYet, all, whom it hath sent to shades profound, âWere purity, O man, compared with thee.â âI own it.â Talbot cried. âO spare my life!â âYes.â Warwick answer'd. âI will spare thy life. âIt were a pity, of such dainty food, âTo rob contempt and scorn. As thus thou liest, âNobility and knighthood o'er thee blush! âThou would'st have spared my life, thee will I spare! âThis too refined and subtile shaft, I spurn, âNor me, nor thee it suits. To touch thy soul, âTo pierce thy heart, the weapon must be blunt, âForcing its way, with uncouth vehemence, âLike dolphin, thro' th' entangling seaman's net. âRise! prostrate Earl, back to thy Castle haste! âScorn'd by the world thou blackenest with thy crimes.â The startled lark, mounts not with swifter speed Before the reaper, than Earl Talbot rose. Thank thee, he would have cried, but shame's huge weight Press'd his tongue down. Utt'rance had flown, and now, Silent he turn'd, and, slow, paced toward the gate That screen'd him from the sight of gaze abhorred. One sigh, for fallen honor, he bestow'd, Another and a deeper for his cheek, So gash'd and marr'd, and of its grace bereft.â He wept. His manhood melted into tears. Warwick, and every eye toward Talbot turn'd. They mark'd him enter the huge castle gate, Smiting his breast, and as the shield of stone Screen'd him from scornful gaze, Warwick advanced To seek fair Eleanor. One of the most furious combats on record is that mentioned by Holinshed, in the reign of Richard II. between a Knight and a Squire, which, as a picture of the times, is here presented to the reader. âOn the seventh of June, 1380, a combat was fought afore the King's Palace at Westminster, on the pavement there, betwixt one Sir John Anneslie, Knight, and one Thomas Katering Esquier; the occasion of which strange and notable triall rose hereof. The Knight accused the Squire of treason, for that where the fortresse of St. Saviour, in Normandy, belonging sometime to Sir John Chandois (to which the Knight was heir. This is the Sir John Chandos, who was one of the chief military heroes, in the reign of Richard II. who won the battle of Auray, over the French, under disadvantageous circumstances, and whose death is so circumstantially and feelingly described by Froissart,) had been committed to the said Katrington, to keep it against the Enemy, whereas he, for money, had sold: and delivered it over to the Frenchmen, when he was sufficiently provided of men, munition and vittals to have defended it against them. By the opinion of true and ancient Knights it was ordained that the truth of the charge should be proven or refuted by fair battell. Hereupon was the place and day appointed, and all things provided readie, with rails and lists made so substantiallie as if the same should have endured forever. The concourse of people that came to London to see this sight was supposed to exceed that of the King's Coronation. âThe king, his nobles, and all the people being come together in the morning of the day appointed, to the place where the lists were set up, the Knight being armed mounted on a faire courser seemelie trapped, entered first as appellant, and shortly after was the Squire called to defend his cause. He, at the third call, did come armed likewise, and riding on a courser trapped with traps imbroidered with his arms. Before they entered battell, they take an oath, as well the Knight as the Squire, that the cause in which they were to fight was true, and that they dealt with no witchcraft, nor art magike, whereby they might obteine the victorie of their adversarie, nor had about them any herbe or stone, or other kind of experiment with which magicians used to triumph over their enemies. This oath received of either of them, and therewith having made their praiers devoutlie, they began the battell, first with spears, after with swords, and lastlie with daggers. They fought long, till finallie the Knight had bereft the Esquier of all his weapons, and at length the Esquier was manfully overthrown by the Knight. But as the Knight would have fallen upon the Esquier, through sweat that ran down by his helmet, his sight was hindered, so that thinking to fall upon the Esquier he fell down sideling himselfe, not coming neere to the Esquire, who perceiving what had happened, although he was almost overcome with long fighting, made to the Knight and threw himselfe upon him, so that many thought the Knight should have beene overcome, other doubted not but that the Knight would recover his feete againe, and get the victorie of his adversary. âThe King in the mean time caused it to be proclaimed that they should staie, and that the Knight should be raised up from the ground, and so meant to take up the matter petwixt them. To be short, such were sent as should take up the Esquier, but coming to the Knight, he besought them that it might please the King to permit them to lie still, for he thanked God he was well, and mistrusted not to obteine the victorie, if the Esquier might be laid on him in manner as he was earst. Finallie when it would not be so granted, he was contented to be raised up, and was no sooner set on his feet, but he cheerfullie went to the King, without any man's helpe, where the Esquier could neither stand nor go without the helpe of two men to hold him up, and therefore was set in his chair to take his ease, to see if he might recover his strength. âThe Knight, at his comming before the King besought him and his nobles to grant him so much that he might be oftsoones laid on the ground, as before, and the Esquier to be laid aloft upon him: for the Knight perceived that the Esquier, through excessive heat, and the weight of his armour, did marvellouslie faint, so as his spirits were in a manner taken from him. âThe King and his nobles perceiving the Knight so couragiouslie to demand to try the battle forth to the uttermost, offering great summes of monie that so it might be doone, decreed that they should be restored againe to the same plight in which they laie when they were raised up. But in the mean time the Esquier fainting, and falling downe in a swoone, fell out of his chaire, as one who was like to yeeld up his last breath presentlie among them. Those that stood about him cast wine and water upon him, seeking to bring him again, but all would not serve till they plucked off the armor and his whole apparell, which thing proved the Knight to be vanquisher. After a little time the Esquier begane to come to himselfe, and lifting up his eyes, began to hold up his head, and to cast a ghostlie looke on every one about him, which when it was reported to the Knight, he cometh to him armed as he was and speaking to him, called him Traitor and false perjured man, asking him if he durst trie the battell with him againe, but the Esquier having neither sense nor spirit whereby to make answer, proclamation was made that the battell was ended. The Esquier immediatelie after he was brought to his lodging and laid in bed, began to war raging words, and so continuing still out of his wits, about nine of the clocke the next day, he yeelded up the ghost. This combat was fought the seventh of June to the great rejoicing of the common people and discouragement of Traitours.â The appointed battle at Coventry, in the year 1398, between the Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Hereford, as detailed by Stow, and Holinshed, presents a better exhibition than the preceding of the circumstances attendant on a solemn combat, but it is too long for a note in this place. Her canopy Peer'd high and sumptuous, and 'mid other forms, Round her, all beauteous, Eleanor appear'd, Holding proud eminenceâno rival there; Like th' rose of morn, turn'd to the eastern sky, Yielding the dew-drop, in her hour of sweets, And nodding o'er each humbler flower beneath; Eclips'd, tho' lovely. She beheld the Chiefâ The victor in her own and virtue's cause, Hastening, majestic, and, as near he came, Her bashful eye, upon the ground she cast. She waited his approach, and when she heard, Greeting and courteous, his well-known voice, If ever pride she felt, and towering thought, Nearer allied to joy than haughtiness, It was to be thus singled, by the man, Whom every eye admired and heart adored. The blush upon her cheek, she, with a glance, Expressive of all cordial confidence, Welcom'd the Chief. âMaiden! all hail! he cried. âHeaven is propitious, thou from death art free.â The pride of Beauty spake. âOne feeble voice, âJoins the loud chorus of surrounding praise. âMy thanks, high-hearted Earl! freely thou hast, âAnd my eternal gratitude.â The Chief, Bending, thus answer made. âMaiden! believe, âNo secret end, that wounds a warrior's name, âPrompts what I say. Still, dangers crowd around. âNow do I see, spite of the semblance fair, âThis spot of earth teems with all hateful things, âFears, vices, venoms. Here the Prince of Air, âThe Fiends that revel in the mid-way sky, âOft, in their hour of pastime wend their flight âAnd laugh and banquet, revelling sportively âUpon the soil, most genial, and in hearts, âBlack as their own, but chiefly his, the man, âWho, with a thousand brethren, would convert âTo the infernal realms, a land, a world, âFair as our own! Here every virtue droops âOver a waste and barren solitude. âDamsel, revered, flee the pestiferous air! âI now am bound to traverse Dinevawr, âHaste thou with me. I do design thee good, â(As well befits the son of Chivalry) âGreater than I may say, in hour like this. âTrust to Earl Warwick. With some maiden near, âThy true attendant, thou mayst yet possess âPortions of happiness, long days of joy. âDoubt not one thing, that Warwick will defend, âAgainst all powers that be, all swords, all spears, âFairest of maids, thy person, and thy fame.â Thus Eleanor replied. âChieftain renown'd, âI have a friend far off, gallant, like thee, âWhose heart I know, nor thine do I suspect. âWhere'er thou lead, with no foreboding dread, âThere will I follow.â Warwick earnest cried, âA faithful knight receives thy confidence. âMaiden, my spear, my heart, O pardon me! âThat gift thou needest not. A happier man âPre-occupies the pinnacle supremeâ âYea, pardon me! Maiden, my all is thine.â He spake, and from her honorable seat Led forth the Damsel. As she moved along, Each tongue with silent earnestness exclaim'd, Gazing on Eleanor, âSo sweet a maid, âPity that harm should reach, or sorrow wound.â High on a charger placed, caparison'd, Prancing, and whilst a thousand prayers arise, The Maiden and the victor Earl advance, While warrior hosts, with the loud shout, attend. BOOK VIII. SCENE, Llewellyn's approach toward Gloster Castle. His eager march Llewellyn now pursued Toward Gloster's towers, yet Snowdon left he not, (So precious in each dark extremity, Whose very atmosphere was as a shield, Screening his head) save with a passing sigh, And faint anticipation, leagued with ill. Whilst on his way, tho' nursing high designs, Oftimes he turn'd, to mark some pinnacle, ('Mid clouds, grey sailing) that majestic gazed O'er many a realm. It seem'd to call him back. It had a cheering voice articulate, A sweet maternal whisper mild, which quench'd, With sudden and mysterious power, all wrath, All shapes of war, discordant images, And raised within his heart, pure thoughts and high. Like one, by hate inspired, by passion roused, Or, in the whirl and tempest of such cares, As, mist-like, hang on this terraqueous ball, When he looks up and sees the tranquil sky, The fair broad moon, some stately planet near, And silence spread thro' all the firmament, His spirit, from the grovelling dreams of earth, Rises disdainful, and awhile he feels, (Not without shame and self-accusing pangs) A calming influenceâa sympathy, Soul-lifting, with the forms that round him shine. In this dissolving hour of tenderness, Llewellyn felt dismay. His soul, that erst Had dared, with courage indiscriminate, Hardiest adventure, now, renounced its post. Tho' his resolves were firm, yet, at this hour, Snowdon appear'd a friend, whom he forsook, Not needful; and as faint it died away, To soothe the sense of parting tho' but brief, One gentle word he spake warm from his heart. (Something he must advance, what, heeding small) âFarewell,â he cried, âthou granite Lord supreme! âRemembrances of joy and scenes no more, âThe spring-tide of my being, thou dost wake. âThe sigh will rise. Whilst mortal things, with men, âLike ocean's sands, change in an endless round, âThou, stedfast, pride of mountains, art the sameâ âThe Ancient Resident. In forming thee, âBefore the plastic word of the Most High, âNature, the mighty architect, put forth âHe loftiest nerve, heaping huge crags sublime âEach on the last, that bold incursions make âInto Heaven's pure empyreal vault, and still â(Laughing at storms, molesting not to thee) âThine head, an everlasting monument, âAugust, shall pierce the skies, till ravenous fires, âDestruction's engines, from their central caves, âBurst, bellowing forth, and from existence blot, âAll we behold.â This said, new thoughts arose. Gloster absorbs his spirit. On he hastes; Each purpose of his soul; intent, to heap Ruin upon that pile, where, as he deem'd, Savage Marauders dwelt, and Ruffians fierce, Preying on Cambria, and to rescue herâ The Maid, whose image, ever on his heart, At morn and noon and night, dwelt, paramount, Absorbing all, but the stern patriot's aims. Day after day, forcing his toilsome course Thro' woods, and forests deep, Llewellyn pass'd. Patient of toil his army follow'd him. The forest pride, oaks, ancient, numberless, Peer'd all around, which e'en the furious blast Scarce moved; their giant limbs, stretch'd wide and far, Scorning each rude assault; or, if they cast Their undulating shadow, o'er the trees, Rising beneath, majestic but for them, And bending with each gentler wind that blew, Sullen they waved, and slow, ill deeming it That aught should move their stedfastness, so long A barrier to the storm, smiling serene, Whilst all around them, in wild tumult cast, Reel'd to and fro.âSo some proud Admiral, Sent by Britannia to earth's farthest shore, Forces his way amid the bellowing deep. Whilst humbler keels, alternate, rise and fall, And winged outrage hovers in their shrouds, He sails serene, breaking the boisterous surge, His head, high soaring, 'mid the war of winds; And if, in some regardless hour, he stoops, Grace in his port, it is the dignity Of bending monarch. Many a towering hill Before him rose, wood-crown'd, with here and there A bleak rude rock between, whose head disdain'd All covering but Heaven's canopy. The scene, Wildly harmonious, in Llewellyn's heart Sank deep. Obtruding thoughts, and images, That seem'd congenial to the place, would rise. He mourn'd the fate which plunged him thus in strife, Th' imperious circumstance, that call'd his mind From scenes, in early childhood, first impress'd With character of joy, and still endued With vivid charms, peculiar, where his heart, Far from a noisy world, could find repose. Solemnity his inmost soul pervades. Sighing he cried. âPoor pilgrims in a world, âFading away, ourselves fast passing on âFrom shadows to reality, we see âOur precious hours, waning before the moon, âYet, our brief span of being, dedicate âTo wars and tumults and corroding strifes, âClosing our eyes, from Nature and from God. âPhantoms that cross our way, eager we seek; âThe faintest shadow of the plain, pursue âWith eager intellect, then drop at last âInto forgetfulness, and leave the chase, âInglorious, to new ephemerÃ¦, âWho, in wild dreams, like their progenitors, âJust flutter and then die. Great Lord of all! âEstablish thou my throne! Let me repress âUnjust aggressors on my native land, âThen, from the cares and duties of a crown, âOft will I turn, and with a sober joy, âThink what I am and whither I am bound, âAnd tranquillize my mind with scenes like these.â It was a goodly and refreshing sight. The children of the forest, where their sires, In ages past, had flourish'd, smiling rose. When spring drew near a sumptuous garb was theirs, Verdant, till Autumn's less congenial breath Brought forth the waning hue, brown, red, and gold; Sad presage of decay. When the voice came, (Commingled with the first rough wintry blast) That call'd for death and fortitudeâa sleepâ An absence from all borrow'd ornament, With patience and in silence, each dismiss'd, Fast falling off, his many-coloured garb, And stood prepared, his limbs unbound and bare, Unshrinking, to sustain his Pall of Snow. Yet was there hope, another spring was near! Oh ye! who little know your high behests, Your lofty designations, here regard An eloquent, tho' silent Monitor! Shall Heâthe World's Great Author, who at first All secret forms and things, fashion'd and ranged, Tho' intricate, with wisdom infinite;â Shall he call forth, from momentary sleep, (Healthful to Nature) the inanimateâ The sluggish and unconscious form, and bid (To reason's ear, with growing freshness fraught) The Army of the Forest, clap their hands, And shout, in ecstasy, âGlory to God;ââ Shall he this living miracle perform, Yet leave his last great work, unfatherly, To wrap himself in blank forgetfulness, And when our eyes first open, to such scenes As Angels' hearts entrance, extinguish Hope, Sweet Star! and plunge us in eternal night?â Summer, with his thick foliage, may obscure The oak's stupendous frame, parrying the blast, Nor eye profane, doubt the machinery, Crouching, beneath, dependant and sublime. Emblem, tho' faint, of that far better part, That spiritual body, which ere long shall stand In naked majesty, when Man puts off Life's transient dress, this garb of fading hue. Say, voluntary mourners! who, for light, Earnest inquire, whilst the bright firmament Teems with refulgence, shall Omnipotence, Who in man's nostril breath'd the breath of life, Endued him with a soul, vast as the skies, With feelings that disdain all mortal bound, And pant for immortality, all else Sinking beneath the horizon of his hopes;â Shall he unveil heaven's spangled canopy, And pierce his spirit with august desiresâ Unutterable thoughts and aspirations, When the fond moment of fulfilment comes To plunge it in despair?âraising the light, For toiling mariner, so long desired, Which safety promises, but leads to death? The dark suggestion, upward borne from hell, Cast it away! Disdainful, plunge thy foe, Into some dark and permanent abyss, No more to rise, and cast shades ominous O'er all beyond the barrier of the grave. We yet shall live! The winter of our daysâ Must come! This mortal garb, this vehicle, Where the ethereal spirit dwells awhile, Must perish and lie low, but he who robes The gorgeous forest, from the sleep of death Our heads will raise! Another Spring is near, Another and a nobler! Hear, O earth! This solemn truth, alike, on all sides round, Nature, in whisper, teaches, faintly heard, But the more certain Word of Prophecy Scatters each shade! The morning mists retire! The sun ascends! The doubtful is made plain! And man, in his great stake, rests satisfied, Pouring the prayer of thankfulness to Heaven. Still thro' the forest, forcing ardent way, Llewellyn pass'd, where seldom woodman's voice, Roused Echo, from her choral cell, or joined, In cadence soft, harmonious minstrelsy With sylvan choristers, happy and gay! There seldom sound was heard, save wood-note wild, Or the vex'd wind, obstructed in its course, Or storm, loud-bellowing, or the thunder deep, Rending heaven's concave, or the distant sound Of mountain-rolling cataract, all white. Creation's sweetest note there seldom came, The human voice angelic, in the nerve Of fellow-kind, kindling divinest joy.â Is it the voice of wind? or bird? or man? A sound, as from a harp, distant, is heard! It dies away. Now to a craggy vale Slow, they descend. It seem'd the lonely spot Where Nature, after overwhelming toil, Retired to rest, and there, in secrecy, Stretch'd her fair limbs, unrobedâso bleak, so wild. Both far and near were seen, wood and wild rock, Save where a stream appear'd, as some huge snake, Winding its course, thro' trees and towering crags, Now lost, then manifest, and urging on, Like earnest traveller, his unknown way. Upon this waste of ages, sand and stone, And pebbles numberless (so long unmoved That the thin blade, in its green infancy, Peep'd here and there, enjoying its brief hour, Till the next torrent from the mountains came;) E'en here Llewellyn pitch'd his evening tent. In the faint distance, lo! a form appears. Now, slow, beside the water-course he comes. His long white beard, his garb of frosty hue, The patient firmness of his tread, unmcved By warrior and bright lance, all speak a man, High in the orders of intelligence.â A Bard! His harp he bears! Reverenc'd of all, The ranks retire as he, slow, passes by; And onward to the Prince he walks. No voice Hails one, whose presence gladdens every heart. Llewellyn's tent he finds. He enters in. Cambria's high Lord, bends at the reverend form. Thus he address'd him. âBard! thy country's pride, âA spirit had surprised me less than thou.â â'Mid these wild scenes, (the barrier of our land, âEffectual, firm, where scarce the human foot, âSo I believed, had wander'd, till my own, âOn daring enterprise, forced its bold way.) âHow camst thou?âWith the ceaseless shapes of war âMy soul is weary. Evening shadows round, âI would forget the rough and stormy scene, âAnd a brief solace find, learning from thee, âWhat joys they are, and thoughts habitual, âWhich thus, in lonely musings, led thee here. âMy helm is off, my torque âThe Golden Torch or Torque was the ancient badge of British Nobility.ââJones's Welsh Bards. âThese ornaments were not confined to the Romans, but appear to have been common amongst the Gauls and other Celtic Nations. (The learned dissertation prefixed by Bishop Percy to his translation of Mallet's Northern Antiquities, appears to have decided the long-disputed question, that the origin of the Gauls was not Celtic but Teutonic.) Boadicea, the British Queen, is described as wearing a Golden Torque. At Pattingham, the estate of the Earls of Chester, in the year 1700, was found a large Torquis of Gold 31b. 20z. weight, about two feet long, curiously twisted and wreathed, with two books at each end. The metal was fine and bright, and so flexible that it would wrap round the hat or arm, and easily return again to its own shape, which resembled a Bow.ââCamden. is cast aside. âI am a man, thy fellow and thy friend.â The Bard replied. âPrince, father of thy realm âMy name is Lhyrarch. Thou dost deign to ask â(In this contemplative and soothing hour,). âMy state and habitudes; know, 'mid these hills, âAnd by the side of the loud waterfall, âFoaming along, alone, I love to stray, âTo muse in silence, to survey the cloud âSailing thro' air, portentous, lowering, dark, âThen hear the wind, then mark the furious storm âFiercely assault some towering pinnacle, âBuried in mists and clouds; anon, survey âThe rushing torrent, bearing in its course âDeep-rooted trees, and rocks, precipitous, âWeltering along the channel of the flood. âI love to lift my head amid the storm, âAnd, on some brow, a ghostly spectacle, âMark the blue lightnings, bursting, 'neath my feet, âWith quick-repeated flash, then, 'mid the gloom, âSucceeding, and that veils all forms in night, âHear the loud thunder, from th' aspiring hills, âReverberate, stilling the mountain winds, âAnd bearing far the wrath of Deity. âThese scenes, the rougher movements of the soul. âNow, in some mood, calm, thoughtful and alone, âI love, upon a still and star-light eve, âTo wander forth; to mark the hosts of Heaven; âTo view the tranquil moon, sailing on high, âSole Empress, thro' the spangled canopy;â âTo mark surrounding forms, sleeping serene âIn the mild beam, high hill and mountain bare, âTipp'd with faint light, and rock, and drowsy stream, âMurmuring along, with here and there, some wave, âUnseen, tho' nigh, sounding with sudden dash, âHarmonious, gliding o'er its rocky bed; âWhilst oft (by th' listener heard) in louder note âTh' up-leaping fish, urged from his limpid haunt, âBy passing night-fly, or the feathery moth, âMoves the dull air; no other sound, to break âThe awful stillness, save night's tuneful bird, âOr, faintly, at long intervals, the wolf, âShaggy and gaunt, that with a ravenous howl âScares the wide forests: then the plaintive harp, âGently, I sweep; its solemn sounds augment âNight's calming influence, and, a sanctity âO'er all things cast, mountain and wood and stream. âNo pamper'd appetites, I seek alone âNature's plain fare, my drink, the crystal stream, âMy food, divided with the birds of heaven. âA world of toil and turmoil, once I knew, âCorroding and ungenial; better form'd âFor silent meditation, and the walk âOf meek-eyed peace and mild humanity. âThe shade I loved, to touch the chord unseen; âTranquil, to meet the fleeting forms of mind âWhich haunted me, new-visaged visitants, âBoth 'mid the day and at the hour of night,â âWhen thro' all worlds imagination roam'd, âAnd shaped ideal things and call'd them true, âAnd bathed in holy phantasies. To wake âNew strains, with harp and voice, and till thy soil, âO Poesy! was my peculiar joy, âWhere at the last, haply, some humble flowers, âI hoped might rise, (courting no idle gaze, âE'en for no alien pleasure, for itself!)â âThe daisy, or the valley's spotless pride, âAnd one perchance, with bloom of amaranth. âNo more involved in tempest, I survey âThe wild careering of the multitude âUnmoved, save with concern and pity true, âWhich ever thrives for all my fellow-kind, âYet, their pursuits, soul withering, I behold, âFar off, like one who hath small sympathies âWith common things. Honors and cankering gold, âThe smiles or frowns of the world's mighty men, âI heed them not. My harp is my delight, âGod my support, and Nature a rich feast âOn which I banquet and find nourishment. The Welsh Bards were not more remarkable for their love of freedom, than they were for the unexceptionable tendency of their writings. In âOceanaâ (it will be remembered) the Immoral Poet was punished with âwhipping,â doubtless with a cat-o-nine tails, each muse very properly contributing a string. âPrince! go thy way! Heaven prosper thy designs! âMake this thine arm, strong to subdue thy foes, âAnd give our land, peace and prosperity. âNow for my wanderings wild. All joy be thine!â âStop!â cried Llewellyn. âLhyrarch! hear thy Prince! âThy feelings are my own. I honor thee! âFrom infancy, my heart hath reverence felt âFor bard and bardic lore, for harp and song. âI need thy soothing strains. 'Mid Aber's walls âHence, shall thy dwelling be.â âNay!â Lhyrarch cried, âMy dwelling is these woods and mountains wild. âForm'd for no courtier, nor a courtier's slave, âI worship independence. Fare thee well!â âWithhold!â Llewellyn cried. One argument, âShall with conviction strike upon thy heartâ âThy Country needs thy service. I am now, âWaging with Edward, England's haughty Prince, âA man-devouring war. Before the fight, âWhat shall not bard achieve? Be thou at hand. âAs other harps inspired our ancestors âTo feats of glory, so thy song shall rouse âCynetha's sons and vengeance be their cry. âThis service o'er! Shouldst thou with spirit firm âStill love the mountain and the green-wood shade, âReturn, and with thee bear thy country's praise.â Lhyrarch exclaim'd âI yield! Now am I bound, âIn Mona's Isle, to join our brotherhood â(The Harps of Cambria) on th' appointed day, âWhere the loud song will rise. That hour pass'd by, âMost prized and choicest of the year, to meet âThee, hastening from thy victor enterprise, âJoyful, my feet shall turn.â Llewellyn cried. âA bard and not a song! Weary and sad, âBefore we part, cheer me with one sweet note, âAnd then farewell.â Lhyrarch no answer gave. Awhile he lean'd, pondering on lofty themes; When, rising, with a look, calm, dignified, Austere, terrific, that half raised the doubt Whether it were a man, or spirit veil'd; He swept the string. Lhyrarch's harp, unknown to guile, In the Patriot's praise shall swell. Every Kingdom, every Isle, On the planet where we dwell, Boasts its Lords, in long array, With titles high, and trappings gay, But the proudest man is he, Who, in slavery's evil hour, Grapples with the tyrant's power, And would set his country free. The sun that lights our Earth is fair, And lovely is creation's face: Where'er we look, on sea or air, Fresh beauties, rising still, we trace, Whilst flowers, with their ten-thousand dyes, On every side spontaneous rise! Ah! who, when laughing life began, E'er deem'd this world, so sweet, so mild, The element of tempests wild, Where Man the torment is of Man! The Strong, who should delight to bless, Wring, from the Weak, the bitter tear; No little nook of quietness, Where wrong and outrage disappear! If, on the soil we call our own, No blood-drunk despot fill the throne, Some monster, in the human form, From far, with his ferocious band, To strew with wrecks the happy land, Advances, like the winter storm. High Heaven, for all the ills that are, Provides some cure, our father kind! He saw oppression mount his car, Vengeance before and death behind; And, to resist his baneful sway, Call'd the Patriot into day! He, warring with corruption's brood, Heedless of calumny the while, Moves on with a disdainful smile, And thinks, and speaks, and acts, for others' good. The health and strength of every land Are they whom truth and justice guide; A small, but an intrepid band, By frown nor interest turn'd aside; Thro' mists, who with an eagle's eye, Their country's friend or foe descry; And, oft as base-born sons appear, With strenuous and effectual might, Drag forth their victims to the light, Scorning all perils in their great career. What gratitude to those we owe Who dared the roughest road to tread,â Our valiant Sires!ânow mouldering low! In many a strife, their blood who shed, That we their Offspring, might be free, And taste the sweets of Liberty! That Gift, the purchase of the Brave, To all our Children we will send, Their heritage till time doth end!â The Blessing which their Fathers gave! If men, in humbler station born, Thus strew with gems their mortal way; What clouds refulgent him adorn, Who rises like the Orb of Dayâ The Patriot Prince!âwith liberal hand, Who scatters blessings round his land;â On equity who rears his throne,â Disdains each low, each sordid end, Proclaims himself his People's Friend, And from their happiness derives his own. O Prince! if I my ardour chide, And curb what every string would tell; It is that thou art satisfied In planning right, in doing well. To fire thy spirit, nerve thy hand, The Noble Dead before thee stand! In elder days, when men arose To quench Old Cambria's hope in night, Thy Ancestors, in glory bright, Triumphant scatter'd all her foes! Impetuous, as our torrents, rise! Llewellyn! Guardian of our Name; The Saxon, and his threat, despise, And strengthen still our Tower of Fame! Whilst England's Slaves pollute our soil, Thou scornest danger, scornest toil. I see, aloft, thy Scabbard thrown! August, let Cambria yet appear, Bulwark'd with the Hero's Spear, Her Genius thou, and all her praise thy own! Thus having sung, retiring from the tent, Lhyrarch exclaim'd, âFarewell!â When the Prince woke From his delirious trance, alone, he stood, While deep around the evening shadows fell. O'er many a wood-crown'd hill and mountain bare, O'er stream, fast rolling, river and wide vale, Now had Llewellyn pass'd, when to his sight, Magnificent, Gloster's tall castle rose. Edwall he call'd; thus to the chief he spake. âGo, noble youth! from me this summons bear; âTell Talbot's Earl, Llewellyn is at hand; âThat death is near him, should he hesitate âTo spread his gates, and to superior might âYield instant his proud charge.â Edwall, the brave, Heard, and obedient sought the English Earl. A Squire to Talbot hastes and eager spake. âA Cambrian chief is nigh, who with bold words, âDemands admittance, and our master's ear.â âAdmit him.â Talbot cried. Now in the hall, Edwall, unaw'd, advances, throng'd with knights, And squires of glory emulous, who stood Around their chief, leaning upon their spears; All valourous men. Young Edwall thus began. Turning to Talbot. âKnow, O English Earl! âLlewellyn, Cambria's brave and warlike Prince, âNow hovers at thy gate.â Talbot turn'd pale. His iron knees, clatter'd, yet not a word Faint utterance found. His chieftains turn'd away, Each to the other whispering, with bent head And finger raised. Even the bravest heart Throbb'd loud, while each more firmly grasp'd his spear. Edwall again. âLlewellyn, with him, bears âHis flower of warriorsâmen grown old in fight âAnd nurs'd in conquest. Open thou thy gate! âHis summons this, or ere the sun doth set, âEach man around shall perish utterly! âNo pausing hour. Speak, or the storm descends.â âWhat force doth he command,â Talbot inquired. Edwall replied, âlook from thy loftiest spire, âAnd count the leaves of the thick-circling trees; âSuch are his army, breathing fearful threats. âGloster, ere this, oft o'er the Cambrian hills, âDisastrous, blood-delighting men, hath sent, âAnd now the hour of vengeance! Spread thy gate! âSo haply mayst thou live, and this thy host.â Talbot exclaim'd, âSpeed to thy noble Prince. âTell him that Talbot, from the lifted bridge, âWould fain address him. Let him hither haste; âWe may be friends.â Edwall replied âThy words, âInstant I bear.â He said and left the hall. Edwall had scarce retired, when thus, aloud, Talbot began. âWarriors, and Archers true, âNow is your moment! Soon, for friendly words, âTo meet me on yon bridge, our foe will haste, âOf harm, undoubting, draw your arrows home! âLet every dart, unerring toward the Prince, âFly, lightning-like, and in his heart's blood bathe! âYou answer not. I wait th' approving voice, âThe forward service.â Silence still prevailed. A Knight advancing spake. âEarl, pardon me, âBy firm obedience taught, till this good hour, âThy word hath been my conscience, now, at length, âI hesitate, necessity is mine. âFrom infancy, 'mid wars have I been bred, âAnd many a Gallic Knight and Brabant Squire, âIn tilt and tournament, hath own'd, too late, âThe prowess of my spear; now lifted high âUpon the prancing charger, now on foot âUrging the lance: my very food, less loved âThan turney and the habiliments of war; Tournaments had so prevailed in England, in the reign of Richard I. as to become the subject of taxation. The following is an extract from the ordinance issued on the occasion. âKnow, that we have permitted tournaments to be held in England, in five places; between Sarum and Wilton; between Warewecke and Kenelingworthe; between Stamford and Warrenford; between Brakeley and Mazebery; between Blie and Tylie-hill; yet so that the peace of our land be not broken, nor justice hindered, nor damage done to our Forests. And an Earl who shall turney there shall pay 20 marcs, and a Baron 10 marcs, and a Knight who has land 4 marcs, and a Knight who has no land 2 marcs.â The lists in these places were always prepared, and the proper officers in constant attendance. âYet, never, 'mid my numberless assaults, âAnd frays and conflicts fierce, urged I my spear âAgainst the generous horse. By the laws of chivalry, it was held disreputable to wound the horse or any of the inferior members of the body. Not e'en a limb, âE'er have I wounded. At man's breast alone, âAnd at his helm, my potent lance I thrust. âMy Father made me swear, on his death bed, âE'en on the field of battle, where he lay, âBleeding in glory's cause, that, like himself, âI too would die an honorable knight. âSpare me this service, aught beside, command!â He ended, when a Squire drew near and spake. âEarl! we are Englishmen. Thro' all the world âThis name is reverenced. Knighthood, like our oaks, âHere thrives, its native soil. Each foreign Lord, âIn whom th' inspiring voice of honor reigns, âWhen niceties and questions keen, prevail, â'Bout combat, and the laws of tournament, âStands 'mid the lists and cries. âChampions, approved! âLearn ye the rule of England, that proud land, âWhich 'mid a faithless world, holds high her head. âThere glory's torch shines brightest. Treach'ry there âNe'er found a covert. War is her delight, âFame her reward, her guide, the generous heart.â âI will not tarnish my dear country's pride. âIf there be Aliens here, let them stand forth.â One general voice is heard, throughout the place âWe all are Englishmen!â Talbot exclaim'd. âCurse on your coward hearts! Knight! and thou Squire; âBefore the eve your lives shall quench my wrath! âI have a Flemish Band, less scrupulous, âWhose hearts these qualms of tenderness disdain.â He said, and with a brow, glowing with rage, Forsook the hall. Each fear'd, and thought his eyes, Never might view the moon-light mild again. Now had young Edwall to his Lord return'd. Llewellyn cried, âA parley, doth he seek? âWe haste to meet him.â As the march began, With speed, unwonted, earnest, posting up, Two English warriors came, a Knight and Squire, âWhere is your Chief,â they cried. And now they stand Before Llewellyn, thus the Knight began. âBrave Prince, from Gloster's towers, hither we haste âTo do thee service.â âSpeak!â Llewellyn cried. The Knight continued. âTalbot hath required âA parley at thy handâventure not near, âSave with the front of war! He meditates âDesigns of treachery. He seeks thy death,â âTo slay, beneath the mask of conference mild. âWe scorn'd in such a damning deed to join. âThe tiger-hearted Earl, swore that our lives, âAlone, should soothe him; that, before the eve âOur heads should grace his loftiest castle-spire. âWe knew him well, that he the oath fulfill'd âCoupled with vengeance, and that such alone âE'er touch'd his heart. Some pitying friends around, âIn secret moment, we, his eagle fangs, âRemorseless, thus escaped, and hither sped âBrave Prince, to bear the tidings to thine ear.â Llewellyn paus'd, when thus the Squire began. âSome news is still behind. Know, noble Prince! âOur hatred to Earl Talbot (shame of knights!) âMakes us forget all thoughts, save how to plunge âInto disgrace profound, that man abhorred. âThere is a Postern Gate, known but of few, âUnguarded at this moment, leading straight âInto the castle's heart. When evening comes, âTo thee will we display that avenue.â Llewellyn earnest cried, âThank ye! That path âCambrians, this night, shall tread. But for your words, âHaply, I might have met the dart unseen, âYou have my praise. Such treachery, till this hour, âNone had conceived of knighthood possible. âBrief is his triumph, short his evil reign. âNow tell me, with the solemn voice of truth, â(While thus we pause, waiting the shades of night) âHow fares the Child of Lancaster, the maid âWhom I most truly love, and who ere now, âBut for the wars, had been Llewellyn's bride.â The Knight replied. âHeaven guard her on her way! âSouthward she hastes, led on by Warwick's Earl.â Llewellyn spake. âSay! are thy words sincere?â âTruly.â He answer'd. Clasping hard his hand, Silent, Llewellyn stood, then to and fro, Pondering, by starts, paced on, when thus he cried. âWhate'er befel this hapless maid, brave man, âI pray thee, on a christian's faith, rehearse.â Thus answer'd the bold Knight. âReport declares, âThat Eleanor was taken, in some ship, âSailing from Gallia. When Earl Warwick reach'd âGloster's stout towers, with him, he bore this maid, âAnd fairer never beam of morning saw. âThere was a plaintive sadness in her air, âAnd in her look, so much of melancholyâ âOf tenderest grief, of drooping sorrow mild, âLovely the more, obtruding on no ear âSave when the sigh, rebellious to her will, âIn thoughtful moment, tremulous burst forth, âAnd told her anguish, that all hearts, alike, âMourn'd and implored, upon so sweet a maid, âHeaven's choicest blessings. With unalter'd course âWarwick design'd to bear her to our lord, âEdward, at Chester, that his tongue might say âIf liberty were hers, or, being sprung âFrom Leicester's traitor Earl, imprisonment. âWhen with a solemnized and awful brow, âTalbot thus spake. âBear not the maiden hence! âThere may be much of danger in that course! âEdward we know! and Eleanor hath borne âEnough of sorrow.â Warwick thus replied, ââBrave Earl, her woes I do commiserate. âHere will I leave her, safe beneath thy roof.â âWe saw the hollow heart. âWarwick scarce gone, âHe woo'd the damsel, proffer'd her to wed; âYea threats advanced; false as Diabolus âHe sought the maid's undoing. Stay thy grief! âFair Eleanor, true, and pre-eminent âIn every deed which worth and heaven approve, âRepulsed him with disdain. She, noble maid, âNew lustre cast o'er virtue's diadem. âSome days had past, when, unexpectedly, âWarwick again return'd. The damsel flew âTo her protector, and more courteous knight, âTruer to honor, or more brave in war, âNever hath raised the spear of chivalry. âShe told her moving tale. Warwick advanced, âFirm-footed to his foe. âFight me,â he cried. âDoth our debate, O Prince, impede thy course?â âSpeak on!â Llewellyn answered. âTill eve fall âOur hours are heavy; grateful will it be, âTo gain some clearer knowledge of the man, âEarl Talbot, who retains my promised bride.â Bending, obedient, thus again the Knight. âThe lists are raised and now the champions meet. âWas never a bolder knight in Christendom, âWho for fair lady, with a truer heart âLifted the lance, and strove more lion-like, âThan Warwick on that day. Each man around, â(And there were crowds, damsels and knights and squires, âAnd 'mid the host the lovely Eleanor,) âKnowing the cause and who discourteous dealt, âImplored th' eternal ruler of the skies, âFor ample vengeance. Warwick won the day. âProstrate on earth, from his abased bed, âWith a most piteous voice, Talbot exclaim'd ââMercy! brave Earl!â E'en he for mercy call'd, âWhose heart was adamant, who never yet âHeard the soft pleader and compassion shew'd âTo any living creatureâman or wormâ âIn childhood's freak, who never spared a fly. âMorose, stern, venomousâhe, mercy sought! âO what a shout arose when Talbot fell! âHigh in the element, the passing bird, âHeard it and sudden turn'd. The air, the earth, âSeem'd, with the deafening clamour to combine âHoarse murmurs of applause. Gasping he lay. âWe waited his death-blow, anxious to see âEarth ridden of its bane. Warwick exclaim'd, â(O piteous tenderness for one so vile!) ââArise! I spare thy life. Oppress'd with shame âLive, scoff of knighthood and nobility!â âHe turns, he kneels, he stands, uttering no word, âAnd toward the castle gate, slowly pass'd on. âHe did not look behind, or he had felt, âFrom every eye, palpable beams of scorn! âWarwick now urged, commissioned by his King, âWestward his journey, bearing courteously, âTo some new place of safety and repose, âThe damsel Eleanor.â Llewellyn cried, âMan, born for sorrow, must his burden bear. âMy hopes, conceived in fancy's gayest hour, âAre blasted! Heaven is wise, and I submit!â The Knight replied. âTruly, thy grief is mine. âIf not discordant with thy better moods, âI have yet other words, at which perchance, âThy sorrowing heart may smile. Hear me, brave Prince. âWhen Warwick journey'd on, safe out of sight, âTalbot exclaim'd. âFloods of perdition seize! âA dastard Earl! I know his secret arts! âNot by fair prowess, but by Demon charms, â(In which my faith is fix'd and radical) âBy incantations, he the fight hath won! âHe was not exorcised! Undoubting harm, âMan-like, I met Earl Warwick, face to face. âHe, with contemptuous cowardice, well knew âThe terror of my spear, and 'neath his mail âSecured Hell's Safeguard, even a black charm, âMade from the toad, henbane and hemlock vile, âSpear-proof; this spell, e'en Talbot's power defied. âO could I meet him now, the priest at hand âFrom him to wrench his confidence, this arm âWould send him to the earth, and every bone âBeat to a blood consistency.' His hand âFierce he upraised, and instant on the ground, âDrove his stout battle-axe! A noble feat! âWarm admiration kindled in his eye, âHe for applause look'd round. He found it not, âSave that the smother'd and contemptuous laugh âMight cheat a heart like his, so prone to turn âAll circumstance, to ravenous vanity. âThe ardour of his mind suspension found, âFor thro' his iron mail, down on the floor, âThe warm blood trickled, and his bruised face âCame like a ghost before him. He exclaim'd ââThe flower is faded! Talbot now descends âTo the low level of humanityâ âA common mortal!ââConquer'd thus by charms, âNot by the bravest knight, England may boast, âHe, on the pain of death, forbade each man âTo speak of his defeat and there is there, âWithin yon castle, a deep dungeon dark, âWhere deeds have oft been done, by torch-light faint; âSuch deeds!âI many a horrid tale might tell âOf blood-congealing import! Let them pass! âThere is on high a faithful registry! âWell, noble Prince, it was a pleasant thing âTo mark this Chief of ours and hear his words. âThe passing knight, some foreign, some home-born, In this period the roads of Christendom were covered with Pilgrims going to some particular shrine; Palmers going from shrine to shrine, like the wandering Jew, everlastingly; and Knights, seeking adventures. Chaucer, who was born about twenty years after the death of Edward I. thus exhibits a âParfit Knightâ who, like other âgentil and parfit Knights,â his contemporaries, loved fighting, or, in the language of the day, âto make proof of his valour.â âA Knight ther was, and that a worthy man, âThat fro the time that he firste began âTo riden out, he loved chivalrie, âTrouthe and honour, freedom and curtesie. âFul as worthy was he in his lordes werre, âAnd thereto had he ridden, no man ferre, âAs well in Christendom as in Hethenesse, âAnd ever honoured for his worthiness. âAt Alisandre he was when it was wonne, âFull often time he hadde the bord begonne âAboven alle nations in Prace âIn Lellowe hadde he reysed and in Race; âNo Cristen man so ofte of his degre. âIn Gernade, at the siege, eke hadde he be, âAt Algesir, and ridden in Belmarie. âAt Leyes was he, and at Satalie âWhan they were wonne; and in the Grete See, âAt many a noble armee hadde he be. âAt mortal battailles hadde he ben fiftene, âAnd foughten for our faith at Tramissene, âIn listes thries, and ay slain his fo. âThis ilke worthy Knight hadde ben also âSome time with the Lord of Palatie, âAgen another Hethen in Turkie, âAnd evermore he had a sovereine prise, âAnd tho' that he was worthy, he was wise, âAnd of his port as meke as is a mayde, âHe never yet no vilanie ne sayde âIn alle his lif into no manner wight: âHe was a very parfit gentil Knight.â At every castle throughout Europe, a knight was always welcome. In return for his hospitable reception, he told his host of his adventures; and brought information from distant quarters, at a period when it was rarely to be obtained in any other way. Most of our old chroniclers were not a little indebted to the garrulity of travelling knights. âThat, journeying, call'd for hospitable fare, âAt Gloster's castle, oft inquiry made, âWith something like condolence for his face, âSo batter'd and so marr'd. A different tale, âEach different knight received, all, to himself, âOf honorable tendencies, his fame âLifting to Heaven, so great in mighty deeds! âBut, at the last, he to one tale adhered, âWith such inflexible integrity, âThat, haply, he may now half deem it true. âHe told the curious stranger, that, far off, âA Robber Chief, dwelt in a cavern rude, âFierce as the tyger, of surpassing strength, âAnd whom with warlike front none dared approach; âWhilst round his home, knee-deep, the bones were piled âOf warriors vanquish'd. âAh! dost fear?â he criedâ ââAt length I heard of his transcendent deeds. âHis victories, I like a feast devour'd, âAnd swore to blazon forth, Talbot's high fame. âI well remember that in Burgundy âKing Edward, in his journey from the Holy Land, thro' Italy and France, gave notable proofe of his great prowesse and strength, at a tournament, or rather battel, against the Earl of Chabloun, and his Burgundians: for the said Count, being a gallant man at arms, after many blowes with the sword betweene King Edward and him, throwing away his weapon, graspt the King about the gorget, and hung upon him with the weight of his massie body, in hope to cast him to the earth, but the King sitting upright, without any bending, put spurs to his lusty horse, and lifted the Count, so hanging about his neeke, quite from the saddle, carrying him away, till hee had forceably shooke him off to the ground.ââSpeed. âEdward, in equal combat, met a Chief âFamous in war, and triumph'd over him, âThat after that, he fought most gallantly âWith Robber, fear'd afar, âAmong those who were outlawd for rebellion and treason, after the battell of Evesham, for partaking with Simon Earl of Leicester, was one Sir Adam Gurdon, a Knight of the parts about Winchester, who with certaine his Complices, kept out of the way of the King's Officers, but made the King's high way between Wilton and Farnham (which by reason of woods and windings, was fitte to shclter enemies) very dangerous for such as meant to passe, but doing most mischief to the goods and lands of such as were the King's friends. Edward hearing of this man's singular courage, gets intelligence of a fit time, and comes upon him with a strong band of followers; but he, nothing terrified, prepares himselfe to fighte for his life to the last gaspe. The Prince hereupon commands that none of his men should dare to interrupt their combat, and forthwith with equal courage they exchanged mighty blowes without winning ground of each other. Edward, delighted with the bravery of Adam's spirit and proofe of his manhood, forgave him and returned to him his forfeit lands, thereby making him a steady friend thro' life.ââSpeed. Many particulars respecting this Sir Adam Gurdon have been collested by White, in his âHistory of Selborneâ (though not including the above incident from Speed.) It appears that Selborne was the family residence of Sir Adam, who, we are told, as he advanced in life, began to feel some solicitude for the safety of his soul (apprehensions, considering his many robberies and plunders, which some will think not unreasonable) and, therefore, agreeably to the faith of the age, he determined to make all secure, in that quarter, by bequeathing one piece of land to Merton College, Oxford, and another piece, in the immediate vicinity of the Church, as a Play-place, to the inhabitants of Selborne forever. It is still appropriated to this use, and is distinguished by the Saxon name of Plestor, a place for sports. and now,â he cried, ââHere is a feat for me, for never a man âThis spear hath shunned. I emulate my Prince. âI sought him, 'mid his wilderness of rock, âAnd, hand to hand, struggled three tedious hours, âTho' short, to me; in truth, it was a sport. âHis efforts vain. My faithful battle-axe â(That is the weapon which I love) my axe, âWith a remorseless fury, to the earth, âDrove himâhe, falling, closed his eyes in death, âBut, 'mid the fray, this scar upon my face âChanced to alight. Forcing my toilsome path, âSerene of heart, thro' skulls and broken spears âAnd ghastly skeletons, I sought my home.â âHere our Chief ended, and with lifted toe, âAnd bloated cheeks, waited the loud applause. âAll men who Talbot knew, wonder'd that one âSo steep'd in cowardice, should ere command âCastle like GlosterâTo his courser's feet âHe owes his honor. On a sportive day âThe Nimrod Edward, âKing Edward I. killed two hundred Bucks, in one day, in Englewood Forest.ââCamden. with his noble court, âHunted the boar. The forest where he lay âWas wide and intricate, and at an hour, âFate so decreed it, Edward, all alone, â(Borne by the steed, so fleet, once his best friend. Henry III. and his Son Edward, having been taken prisoners, by the Earl of Leicester, in the Barons' war, the Earl retained them near him, and under the sanction of their names, exercised complete authority. Prince Edward however thus effected his escape. âThe Earl of Gloucester having become jealous of Simon De Montford, Earl of Leicester, and thinking it essential to the success of his plan, to get the young Prince out of his hands, devised the following means for that purpose.âLeicester, with his royal Prisoners, lay at Hereford; Roger de Mortimer (a partisan of Gloucester) having many friends at Hereford, made Edward a present, by a third hand, of a very swift horse, and withal acquainted him with the use he was to make of it, and the design laid for the recovery of his liberty. To second the project, the Prince feigning himself ill, and to want exercise, desir'd leave to ride some horses. The Earl of Leicester, who suspected nothing of the matter, granted his request, though with great precaution. Besides his usual guard, he ordered some gentlemen to keep always near him, and to have their eye upon him continually. Edward being come into the fields, immediately breathed two or three horses. Then he called for that lately presented him, and as if he had a mind to use him gently to his rider, walk'd him at some distance from his guard, being accompanied by the gentlemen who kept close to him. When he was come to a certain place which he had before carefully remarked, and which seemed proper for his design, laying the reins on his horse's neck, and clapping spurs to his sides, he so surprized those that attended him, that he was at a good distance before they were recovered from their astonishment. However, they rid after him till they saw a troop of horse, sent by the Earl of Gloucester to favour his escape.ââRapin.) âStood near the boar, and at him plunged his spear. âThe wounded monster, wild and furious, âTurn'd, and at Edward's horse, drove his huge tusk. âThe horse and rider fell. Twelve dogs at hand âSeized on the beast, and whilst their many fangs âBound him to earth, Talbot full-flush'd approach'd, âAnd seeing the fierce tenant of the woods, âO'ermaster'd and in death, most gallantly, âUprais'd his lance and pierced him. Partly stunned âBy the hard fall, Edward now rose, and saw, âAdmiring, Talbot's spear, thro' the dead boar. ââI've killed him,â he exclaim'd, âand work it was âBefitting giant, but, no boaster's words, âEnough, O King, to say, here lies thy foe!â ââMost noble;â Edward cried. âThy ancestors âWere brave and valiant, and their progeny, âFrom thee I judge, will never blot their fame. âFriend from this hour!âTo thee, I owe my life. âSo Edward, grateful man! to Talbot gave, âThis castle and his valour still commends.â The Knight now ceas'd. Silence the Prince aroused; Else had he shewn attention, tho' the words In thier distinct significance were all Like the still fluttering leaf. Tho' full and clear, Llewellyn heard them not; his spirit ran, On scenes, far distant, when, at length, he cried, Clenching his spear. âMeanest of mortal kind! âMost abject in the scale of living things! âTalbot! I swear, upon yon towering spire, âThy head shall stand. Vices like thine convert âCrimes into virtues, and, a sanctity, âGive to th' avenging sword.â Thus communing, The eve advanced; when, with feint, laudable, 'Mid wars and strifes, Llewellyn led his force Near to the gate. Talbot expectant stood, Waiting the parley. Few, around him, throug'd; But, near, a host there was, (their heads just rose,) Of base assassins, who, their nourishment From dark deeds drew, and fed alone on death. Praise to the air we breathe, a foreign band, Who, for small pay, stretch forth their willing arm, Alike, in every cause, and, murder, make Their lawful calling. Now had darkness veil'd Heaven's canopy; even the few faint stars That shone on high, with mists, hard contest held, Who first should yield. Led, by the English Knight, Thro' doubtful ways, and winding, to the door, (Where secret messengers pass'd to and fro, In years gone by, neglected, scarce descried) Llewellyn and the Cambrian forces came. All silent; the near bird still slept serene. The Knight and Squire preceded. After them, His sword unsheath'd, Llewellyn boldly pass'd! And after him, his Chiefs full-often tried, Each panting for some valiant deed at arms. Unseen and unsuspected, now they stand, All marshall'd, in the centre of their foes! Oh! what a shout was there! Talbot exclaim'd. âTreason!â He stood astounded. Every man Felt death within his reins. Each, of all round, Unknowing how to act or where to speed, Stood motionless. The gallant Cambrians Advance, with lifted spear. Foes, faintly seen, Roused fancy, while the grisly form of death Each warrior scared, and danger, magnified, Tenfold. With horrors numberless, each saw Himself encompass'd and aloud exclaim'd, âQuarter! We yield!â Llewellyn cried aloud, âQuarter receive! Vanquish'd, bear here your arms.â O'erwhelm'd with flood-like panic and surprise, Men, brave at heart, press'd forward, to resign The sword and lance; and, prisoners, now they stand. âYour Chief!â Llewellyn cried. âSearch! Him I seek!â One forward came and spake. âKnow, noble Prince! âOur Governor, Earl Talbot, is far off. âWhen he beheld his castle, thus surprised, âWith quivering lip and knee, loud he exclaim'd, ââGod for us all, and each man for himself!â âNo other word he utter'd, but, I trow, âCourageous, in despair, forth, to the mote, âSped like the deer. Heedless of cumbering mail, âInto the tide he plunged, and lustily, âWarr'd with the billow. On the opposing bank, âBy the thin light of star-beam, glimmering faint, âWe saw him mount; then rushing on his way, âHe turn'd no look behind, but, onward sped, âImpetuous, ardent. On my faith, I judge, âTill he hath reach'd full twenty measured miles, âHe still will look straight forward, nor one thought âCast on his suffering friends.â Morn now advanced, When to the Captives, thus Llewellyn spake. âPrisoners, ye are. Wrongs, countless, prompt my heart âTo just retaliation, fierce and full. âI check th' avenging impulse, war, too oft, âUrges on victors. No delight in blood, âNor appetite for slaughter, I will spare âEach man from harm. Until the wars shall cease âCambria must feed you. Of these lofty towers, âLate England's pride, take you a final glance, âNo stone upon its fellow, hence, shall rest; âIts huge embattlements, prostrate shall lie; âWhile owls, and bats, and the nocturnal beast, âAnd lizard venomous, shall thrive and make âThis spot their habitation. Never more âUpon my land, its legions shall outpour âAnd scatter death, filling with thorns and swords âThe midnight pillow.â Lo! the work begins, And whilst toward Cambria, sad, the prisoners speed, Destruction, with his besom, sweeps the plain. BOOK IX. SCENE, Chester. Both knight and squire, matured in war and strife, Of glory emulous, toward Chester's walls Press'd earnest: every hour new warriors brought, Who round their monarch stand, a buttress strong, Each panting for the fight. Day after day Pass'd on inactive. Edward strove to check His spirit, thirsting for the great exploit.â With cause undoubted, and, his foe, a man, Darling of valour; with inspiring thoughtsâ The hope of quenching strife, long-wasting wars, And planting on the desolate wide heap Of wasted nations, there ordain'd to thrive, The fair luxuriant oliveâwho shall blame, If such high views Edward now call'd his own. And what if other thoughts, inferior, Too sway'd the Warrior in a warlike ageâ The thirst of fameâJustice applauding near! Who shall behold the Flower of England's Kings, Thus, seeking conflict, and not check the curse, The due of Conqu'rors, who, to lift their names Amongst the Great Bad Men, drive their scyth'd cars, Unshrinking, in their vehemence of rage, O'er writhing myriads. Be the truth confess'd, (All erring mortals!) Edward, propped of right, And equity his guide, thought to eclipse, In this fair contest, man opposed to man, The feats by him display'd 'mid Palestine, The matchless actions, which thro' Europe spread His valourous might, and thro' the Panim ranks Struck terror and amaze; but he, his soul, Ardent, must curb. The Bishop linger'd yet. He from the land of hills had not return'd, And peace and war hung pendent in the scale. He comes! His retinue, far o'er the Marsh, Slowly draws near, which even the cloud outstripp'd, The faint thin cloud, when scarce a breath of heaven Disturbs the element. Now, he appears Before the King, who, thus, the Sire address'd. âGood Father! for the tidings thou dost bring âLong have we waited, and unwillingly âRepress'd our martial spirits. Forth declare! âWhat says Llewellyn?â Thus the Bishop spake. âO King! for whom affection and true love, âFaithful, I bear, attend me patiently. âI now am old. A younger man, ere this, âMight have returned, but thou wilt pardon me. âAt thy command, I to Llewellyn sped! âI claim'd submission; even with such speech âAs simple truth required, and, fatherly, âGave my advice. I urged him, (by thee taught) âFor the wide common-wealth, to yield his crown, âAnd, by a noble deed, dispassionate, âWhere reason triumph'd, offer at the shrine âOf public good, his partial interests, small, âSo would posterity (these were my words,) âSo would posterity, heap on his name âEternal praises, whilst, in concord joined, âEngland and Cambria, 'neath one common Prince, âEdward, our Lord, would rise to strength and fame, â(Their mutual interest this, their common weal,) âAnd both exult in blessings new and great. âO what a fearful and indignant flood âOf spirit-bursting scorn, floow'd my words. âHe swore, to thy controul, never to yield. âHe spake of his progenitors and sires, âWith the enthusiast's ardour, and declared, âWith a solemnity which awed my soulâ âTo Saxon yoke, he never would submit, âBut, in one hour, yea, not a point between, âResign his independence and his life.â Edward exclaim'd aloud. âThe die is cast! âWarriors! the prospect opens to our view! âBucklers, I see, must clash. Well Father, say âWhat further spake this Prince, to fury wrought. âIt will amuse us ere the fight begin.â The aged Sire replied. âI charged him full, âWith first provoking whom all Europe fear'd, âEdward, our lord. I told him, he unsheathed, âIn luckless hour, the sword, and that a storm, âO'erwhelming, on his unprotected head, âWas then about to fall, death-fraught and fierce, âWhich nought but his submission could avert. âHe own'd that he the banner first unfurl'd âAnd drove the hostile lance, but he declared, â(With such apparent earnestness, and words âSo well adapted to the cause of truth, âThat strangers might have credited his speech âAnd deem'd him half a martyr) he declared âThat peace was his delight; that grinding wrongs, âAugmenting, as forbearance shew'd itself, âHad left no option, but, reluctantly, âCompell'd him to the war. Oft he declared âThe bane of Cambria was those holds accurs'd âWhere the March Lords, lawless, abode, and fill'd âHis land, with blood and violence. He said, âThe firm and inmost purpose of his soul, âWas to maintain, truth and integrity, âBoth with his subjects and with England's King. âHe named, and I with sorrow heard the words, âThat ere he broke the laws of amity, âSo late established 'tween your mutual realms, âThat he had sent, yea, once, and twice, and thrice, âTo thee, O King! moving Remonstrances, âWherein he told his great and many wrongs, âWith tone of injury felt, yet, as he thought, âRespectful to a Prince, potent like thee. âHe named th' afflictions, under which his land âGroan'd and mourn'd heavily. Shouldst thou remove âThese bitter grievances, hostile alike âTo right and treaties, he profess'd himself âReady to call thee friend. Pardon my words âMy language is no sycophant's. I speak âHumbly, tho' with the words which truth directs. âLlewellyn is a brave and noble man! âI pitied him! Hypocrisy ne'er spake âWith voice like his, and with a countenance âSo guileless, of his heart a mirror true. âHe says if thou to his remonstrances, âStill wilt incline, and deal with equity âToward his grieved subjects (who have countless wrongs âSuffer'd from the Lord Marchers and their train, âSo he declares) that he will then return âTo amity, restore all spoils, and prove âThat Cambria's oath is sacred. Could I hope, âPeace to restore, 'tween Edward, my liege Lord âAnd Cambria's Prince, then had I seen enough; âMy head, in peace, down to the grave would go.â Edward replied. âFather! thy words do strike âAstonishment, into my very heart, âWhat catalogue of wrongs have I received? âNone! No remonstrance ever met these eyes, âOf Cambrian injuries! Fable it is, âAnd calumny, 'gainst justice and our land.â Amid th' encircling champions, there was one, A Norman Lord, De Frankton, who sustain'd, Amid the nobles of King Edward's court High influence At Tunis, he had waged, Bravely the war, and oft in Palestine 'Mid Egypt's ranks and lordly Saracens, Made terrible his name. When England's King, Back to his native country urged his course, De Frankton follow'd. His applauding Prince, Own'd his deserts, and, with a heart oppress'd With generous impulses, made him his Steward; And post to post, still in a bright array, Advanced him, till High Chancellor he stood. Full many a man, native of England's clime, Had better filled that office, and dispensed Justice, more equal, but a subtile tongue, A heart, time-serving, like the osier twig, Bending with every breeze, maintain'd him still His monarch's fav'rite. Frankton raised his head, Over the boldest baron of the land, With haughty sovereignty. The air he breath'd, The ground on which he trod, for spirit fill'd, Like his, with such ethereal particles, Seem'd too abased, and with impurities Too pregnant. Wrongs and injuries, full oft, Proud barons had sustain'd, striving to curb Their rising spirits, whilst, at heart, they mourn'd That their brave King, should deem each excellence Comprised in valour, and, that who could wield Bravely the sword, claim'd, by inheritance, All virtues, and all qualities of state: But, grateful to their souls, a threat'ning train Now was prepared, needing one only spark, To burst, up-pouring, from the troubled earth, With a volcanic fury. Whilst his tale, The holy Sire preferred, Frankton betray'd Strange gestures and a troubled mind. His cheek Wore an unusual paleness. Now it flush'd, Then white became; and as the King disclaim'd All knowledge of the Cambrian grievances, Slow, he retired. The Bishop, thus, his speech, Pursued to Edward. âSire! thy servant's age, âWith heart like thine, will plead apology âFor words, the fruit of deep experience. âI must be heard! I must the truth declare! âWith all thy virtues, one thou yet dost need!â âTo elevated rank, like thine, supreme, âA sovereign excellence!âeven to know, âStrictly, the form and character of things;â âTo view the structure of the state machine, âNot with another's eye, but with thine own. âThou now art leading a vast army forth âTo whelm the man in misery, whose heart, âKnowing, e'en thou wouldst honor. Cambria's Prince, âIf there be truth below, hath suffer'd long, âAnd grievously, and only grasp'd the sword, âTo speak, when other arguments were vain!â Edward replied. âBishop! thy words and voice, âHad I not known thee, would have roused mine ire. âHear, reverend man! Justice, till this good hour, âHave I beheld, with an adoring eye. âMy great ambition is, to please my God, âTo serve my country, and obtain the meed, âUpon the valiant and the good bestow'd âBy high posterity. This do I swear. âI know no wrongs and bitter grievances, âBorne by Llewellyn. I have oft sustain'd âInsults and wrongs from him, and now unsheath, âReluctantly, the sword. Whoe'er beheld âHumble or bold âremonstranceâ? These mine eyes, âNeither hath reach'd.â The Bishop bent his head. âPardon my words,â he cried. âTreason is near! âThy chancellor De Frankton, search him well! âWhilst Cambria's Prince rehears'd his many griefs âAnd thy disdain of his remonstrances, âLike lightning to my mind De Frankton came. âHe is the man on whom this wrong alights!â Edward exclaim'd. âWhere hath the fox retired? âI see him not! Search! Vengeance is at hand!â Throughout the hall the smile of ecstasy Sat on each brow. Baron to Baron spake. âOur time is come,â they cried. âWith glorious ray âThe sun now rises!â and at Edward's word, Joy in their eye, full many a chieftain bold Rush'd from the hall, impetuous as the storm. De Frankton now arrives. Earl Mortimer, Reluctant, led him in. Edward thus spakeâ âFrankton! Llewellyn, to our court hath sent, âSo he avers, Remonstrances of wrongs, âAnd friendly admonitions, urging us âHis grievance to redress. Tidings most new. âAnswer, O man! know'st thou of what I say?â Forcing the desperate smile of confidence, âYea!â answer'd Frankton. âOnce and twice and thrice, âAs it became my office, to thine eye, âI spread them, and thy sovereign word required.â âFrankton!â The King exclaim'd. âThese are wild dreams! âAre thy full faculties awake?â He cried, âMonarch! It is my very noon of thought. âPerchance, thy recollection, like a flood, âIn unappointed moment and strange hour, âMay not return. It is the tide's low neap. âAnon, thou wilt remember, and acquit âDe Frankton of all crime. Well dost thou know âBy intellects, acute and logical, âMy evidence is of the higher kind; âThe positive is mine. I recollect, âAnd thine, the negative. Thou merely feel'st, âA passiveness. Thou but rememberest not âTo have remember'd, and, a fugitive, âOur memory is at best. Doubt not my words! âThere lives not, in the air we breathe, than mine, âMore Roman-like and sterner rectitude.â All hands are raised. Edward, a deep long breath Inhaled, and then indignantly exclaim'd, âFrankton! thy hour is come! Thy end is near! âInsultest thou thy Monarch, with vain words, âAnd falsehoods, huge as the circumference âOf vast Behemoth? By the stars on high, âNo sentence, no soft cadence, not the breath âOf eve, slow whispering, when the summer sun âSinks tranquil, ever till this hour, hath reach'd âMine ear, of Cambria's wrongs. Oft hast thou told âWith all thy subtile wit and eloquence, âOf ills, by England borne; and Cambrian faith, âAnd Cambrian deeds, display'd with shades so dark, âThat he who had restrain'd the vehemence âOf frantic anger, must have first renounced âMan's feelings and have sunk to brutish sloth. âUpon thine head, this war's stupendous guilt, âRests, and its weight shall crush thee to the earth!â Turning to his brave Barons near, he cried, âLords! I have injured you. Your native rights âYour Prince's confidence, I have withheld âToo often, and on Frankton lean'd my arm, âMaking a reed my staff. His character, âNow blazes and extinguishes all doubt. âHenceforth, till this good land, barren become âOf every virtue, and her sons, so famed âFor intellect and eminence of soul, âRelapse, and yield their high prerogative, âNever will I, thrusting my friends aside, âMy subjects, my most natural supports, âHence, rest my confidence in Foreigner. âFrankton, you heard! He with heroic words, âUtter'd aloud, with bold unblushing face, âThought to expunge, from his poor monarch's mind, â(Imbecile grown and tottering with old age) âAll recollection: by his confidence, âAgainst conviction, to convince his King âThat he, till now, with specious semblances â(Plunged in a long and a tumultuous trance) âHad said and thought, and done, unwittingly, âThings of first moment; where his life and death, âDeeply involved, stood foremost. Had his crime âBeen of a mild, or less atrocious form, âIn his conceit there is such novelty âThat I had smiled, and sent him to rejoice, âAt his escape, in distant banishment. âBarons! his guilt you see. What punishment âDeserves the traitor?â âDeath! Immediate death!â All shouted, and with voice again refresh'd, Re-answer'd, âDeath!â âDeath be thy instant lot!â Edward exclaim'd. âThy name shall hence descend âA traitor on time's flood, whilst lisping tongues, âIn after years, shall curse thee, and bequeath âThat curse to their successors, as they rise âIn endless generations. Bear him hence! âExalt him to mid air! Let the rough storm âBleach his dishonor'd carcass, and heaven's birds âFeed nightly on him, till his bones fall down, âAnd dogs devour th' unperish'd residue!â De Frankton vainly strove to frame the speech, Ready and eloquent, but mostly, prompt And with persuasion fill'd, in error's cause, And when the atmosphere around his heart With falsehood lower'd. Edward repress'd his tongue, Just speaking, with th' indignant look of scorn. When with voice vehement. âOff!â he exclaim'd. âTraitor, away!â Upon a summer's morn, The dozing ants, by some regardless foot, Passing, disturb'd, throwing their cavern'd dome Into confusion, less display the change From rest to sudden tumult, than the hall Wherein they stood. At Edward's word, the knightâ Earl and brave baron, from their list'ning state, Rose suddenly. A complicated sound, And active movements spread, when thronging near They seize De Frankton. Lo! he hastes away! The torrent bears him with resistless force! The door is closed. Trembling the Bishop hastes. Kneeling, he cried. âSpare him, my Liege, tho' vile!â Edward exclaim'd. âBishop! there is a debt, âSacred, which justice claims. Thou plead'st in vain.â Now on their ear the distant voice arose, Confused, as of the midnight roaring wave. Save that the Bishop sad and silent stood, Edward, alone, paces the castle hall. He starts! With lifted hand, pausing, he stands! Heaven's concave seem'd dissever'd, at the shout, Bursting around him! Now the door expands: And all, with a tumultuous joy return! The rippling wave, catching the radiant sun, And sending forth its ever-changeful beam, Less bright, than the exultant eyeballs round Of the death-dealing concourse that now throng'd Back to their King. âHow died he?â Edward cried. Earl Mortimer, bending with reverence due, Thus answer made. âMy native land will thrive! âNow will she lift her Heaven-aspiring head! âHer henbane is no more! Our greatest foe âHath perish'd as he ought! Even now, O King! âHe, his green leaves of subtilty, put forth. âAnd, to the last, proved his consistency. âHe spake with winning accent, and would fain, âHave proved, by a deduction logical, âMost clear and manifest, that, by thy words, âThou didst not mean his death. Most groundless thought! âHe said we were deceived, yea palpably; âThat all thou said'st, by its true import meant, â(If well interpreted by able minds,) âHis liberation. He, most earnestly, âUrged us, as we were bound, to let him scape. âHe reason'd that the thing would pleasure thee, âAnd told us, with solemnity of brow, âIf still we dared, thus to deprive of breath âA man so free of guile! our forfeit lives, âTo vengeance due, would be the consequence; âThat thou his murderers wouldst pursue to death. âWe bade him count his beads, nor moments lose, âSo precious, when the last approach'd him fast. âNow, straining tight the cord, he, satisfied, âThat hope had vanish'd, with a languid look, âAn inexpressive feebleness of gaze, âWhen day had flown, and evening shades were nigh, âThus trembling spake. ââToo late, I own my crime. âPerdition crowds upon my lagging feet! âHell is my portion! Let me hence, and know âThe worstâthe wrath of an offended God! âI have drunk deep of earthly eminence, âAnd grasp'd each idle pageant with a zeal, âAn overwhelming vehemence of soul, âUnfitting transient things, such as all seem, âThe fairest and the brightest, at this hour âOf rigid scrutiny. My better part, âThe Deathful Spirit, how it looks upon me, âAnd scares me with its abjectness!âno robe, âNo costly ornament, with which to meet âThe morning of new life! O mark my words. âI have a weight within! It must be told! âThe secret hear! Avarice hath been my bane! âLlewellyn told his wrongsâthere he did wellâ âHe only failed in the minuter thing, âNo Bribe he sent! Accumulated crimes, âUpon my head, rest with a mountain weight, âOf diverse kinds, probing my inmost soul! âMy days have been one life-extended sin! âNow let me perish! Perish! Would I might âSink to oblivion! I shall never die! âThe Brute is my superior! envied lot! âSecure he slumbers in forgetfulness, âNo more to wake at the appointed hour, âAnd feel Heaven's vengeance! I shall never die!â âHis roused and tempest-beaten soul within, âOver his rayless eyeballs cast a film âImpenetrably dark. Estranged from earth, âTho' high we raised, amid the deafening shout, âHis noxious carcass, feeling he had none. âThe anguish of his spirit quench'd his pain. âAnd now he hangs, amid the loftiest tree, âUnpitied, still as is the slumbering leaf.â Edward replied. âAn antidote for sin âIs, to behold the wicked in their death. âHeaven grant us peace in that soul-probing hour. âFor this your zeal your debtor here I stand, âYour country thanks you.â Nigh his Monarch's seat, The Bishop stood. His eyes upon the ground, In meditation wrapt, devout he pray'd That war might cease, and peace her olive wand Spread o'er the nations. From his thoughts severe, He woke; for Edward spake. âFather, revered, âAnd ye, brave men, the bulwark of our land, âHear me! Important thoughts oppress my mind. âThis serpent is no more. This asp, disguised, âHath paid the debt, due to his many crimes. âNow it behoves us, promptly to project âThe path of wisdom. Tho' renown I seek âAnd warfare prize, more than the bread I eat; âTho' I my very life would offer up, âEngland to mould into one mighty state; âJustice is still my altar, where I pay âDue sacrifice. Llewellyn we have wrong'd. âHis fair complaints he to De Frankton sent, âWhere, in that dark receptacle, his mind, âDormant they lay. We saw the wanton sword âWielded by Cambria, and (with cause unknown) âWe judg'd him the aggressor, and thus bent âOur arms against him. But for this sage man, âA faithful friend and true, tender of heart, âWe had our swords, tarnish'd with innocence. âDoubtless there have been wrongs which thus have roused âLlewellyn's ire, and forced him to the field.â The Bishop spake, low bending to the earth. âThe greatest gift which Heaven bestows on man, âIs, when he fills Earth's Rulers, with high thoughts âOf right and equity, and prompts their hearts âTo generous deeds, brave and magnanimous. âMy spirit utters sounds. I love my King! âI love my Country, but, still more than these, âTruth, the rare gem, which e'en Omnipotence âWears in his crownâfilling all Heaven with light. âO Prince! a lengthen'd life of piety, âAnd, many acts of faithfulness, perform'd âFrom upright heart, is the security, âThat what I utter in this solemn hour âIs both sincere and just. Hear me, my Lord! âLlewellyn hath been wrong'd. Here do I stand âNo advocate but truth's. He covets not âTo call his own, and guide imperiously, âThe springs, which move the mighty men of earth, âWealth and dominion; he desires alone âHis father's patrimonial lands, the hills âWhere he was born, and where in infancy âHe felt the charms of being, the delight âOf mountain air, health, peace and liberty. âThe holy teacher of mankind hath said, âWhat ye desire from others, do the same. âWert thou a Prince o'er Cambria, wouldst thou see âUnmoved thy country torn, by little kings, âBy shrimps of royalty, by men renown'd, âNot for the noble deed, but pillage fierce, âFor ravenous appetite of spoil and blood. âBefore this noble host, and thee, O King, âHere do I charge, with these enormities, âUnshrinking, the Lords Marchers. Several of the Lord Marchers of Wales had and enjoyed great franchises in their Seigneuries, and even a Regalitatem, a sort of a Royal Power. They had their Chancery, their Justiciers, and other great Officers, with an extensive jurisdiction, belonging to the chief court of their Honor.ââMadox's Baronia Anglica. Of our land âThey are the shame. The dissolute and vile, âFrom instinct, e'en the refuse of mankind, âCrowd round their banner. Form'd for desperate deeds, âFearing, nor God, nor Satan, they are free âFrom every tie which binds the wise and good, âAnd on they laughing go, hell at their heels. âThou little knew'st these evils (Kings behold âThrough other mediums) or thy generous heart âHad stemm'd corruption's flood. One, now no more, âBatten'd on these disasters. He partook âA sturdy portion of the blood-hound spoils. âPardon this tumult in an old man's veins! âI may have gone too far, tho' not in truth, âIn prudence. As I feel, I speak. Again, âPardon whate'er irreverend seem to thee.â Some Marcher Lords, crowding around the King, Thus heard the Bishop. Anger moved their hearts, Fiercely they look'd, tho' not a word they spake. Each wished himself endued with eloquence, That he might pour rough torrents of reproach, And fierce recriminations, on the man Who thus impeach'd them, but the tardy words Kept down by conscience, in their sluggish fits Rose not to war. Each Lord, himself, believed Somewhat too harshly treatedâmuch too harsh!â Yea, with, most clear injustice! yet, confess'd, Freely, it bore some faithful lineaments To his near neighbour, but, all vow'd sincere, In the ejaculation of the heart, That none but Bishop had such words preferr'd, And lived to glory in the morning light. Undaunted, and with voice more confident, Again to Edward, thus the Prelate spake. âAs now a spring of light bursts on thy mind, âPursue the stream. Let not the current glide, âOut of thine eye, one moment: it will lead, âTho' intricate, up to the secret source. âBelieve me, O my Sovereign and liege Lord.â âWith that just equipoise of sentiment â'Tween man and man, whate'er his name or clime, â(When what is right, a welcome guest comes in) âI heard Llewellyn. Piteous was his tale! âIf thou wilt do him justice and redress âThe heavy grievances, which he hath long âFelt and bemoan'd, in him thou wilt behold, âA friend immoveable. I promised him, â(Heaven in my sight) to state to thee his ills, âPlain and ungarnished. This have I perform'd, âAnd he, the while, waits, with anxiety, âThe issue, and reposes patiently, âHe and his men at arms, round Snowdon's base, âAnd hopes, till hard necessity compel, âNo more to wield the sword, or hurl the lance.â Edward replied, âFather thy pitying heart âHath been too freely wrought on. My March Lords, âAre other than the miscreants, thou dost state. âThey are all true, and noble, and brave men; âTried oft, and ever found the same, sincere, âValiant and faithful. Still, I honor thee. âAltho' thy words are bold, they spring from truth, âReal, or so conceived, and thou hast still âThy monarch's confidence. Hear me yet more. âFather, from what thou say'st of Cambria's Prince, âHis worth, and his desire, still to maintain âJustice and concord, I will even check âThe wrathful impulse, which, till now, urged on âMy soul to war, and to its scabbard, safe âReturn the sword!â The Bishop look'd to heaven. The warriors paus'd, doubting of what they heard. Edward continued. âEre thy mortal hours âClose on a life well spent, one virtue more âAdd to thy radiant catalogue. This day âThou and some trusty barons shall repair âTo Cambria's Prince, and there sign amity, âCordial and true, between our jarring realms! âIf wrongs, as thou hast said (some will arise âSpite of our efforts) and not thirst of blood, âNor hatred, nor ambition of new power, âLlewellyn urged, with a remorseless hand, âTo pierce our frontiers, scattering wide dismay, âIf these his motives and he now desires, âConcord, and will restore the spoils of warâ âPeace shall return! All these my warriors brave, âMy barons and bold knights, and potent earls, âI at their head, will on a fresh crusade âLike Richard, lion heart, that chief of men, Richard I. displayed such marvellous instances of courage in the Holy Land, against the Saracens, as almost to equal the feats which the Bards ascribe to Arthur. âRichard, at the head of only seventeen horsemen, and a small body of foot, being surrounded by the Sultan's army, they maintained their ground with such valour, that the Turks and Saracens quite astonished and discouraged could not be brought by their Leaders to renew the attack. Richard rode that day along the whole line of the enemy, and dared them all to a single combat. but not one of them would venture to come out against him.ââLyttelton's Henry II. âSeek Palestine, and crush the Soldan's name. âWarfare I love, but justice I adore!â A principle of equity and luminous arrangement has universally been ascribed to the jurisprudence established in this reign. âKing Edward the First was the first that settled the law and state, deserving the title of England's Justinian, and freed this Kingdom from the wardship of the Peers, shewing himself, in all his actions, capable to command, not this realm only but the whole world.â Weaver's Funeral Monuments. âEdward I. proved himself to be a warlike, wise and victorious Prince, and may justly be stiled the best Lawgiver.â Harleian Miscellany. âEdward I. was illustrious as a General, but more illustrious as a Legislator. In the former capacity he had many equals, in the latter he was excelled by none of the Kings of England.ââHenry. O Peace! thou brightest jewel of the skies, Which like eve's star, sometimes dost cheer the world With thy mild beams, deserted else and dark, How many clouds may rise and mists obtuse To hide thy radiance! Now the prospect round, The azure firmament and the green earth, Lulls every soul, whilst permanence of joy Seems dealt to mortals. Lo! an unseen spring, The secret mover of the elements, Works, and heaven's canopy, sudden is changed! The winds are heard! Th' indignant tempest raves, While deluged earth pauses and stands aghast! Once more the shades disperse! Some rising breath Scatters the sullen mists! The sun appears! The fields are gay, and sylvan choristers Break forth, rejoicing, while all nature smiles! So are life's changes. Here tranquillity Seems permanent, as th' everlasting hills, When, in dark clouds, some sudden circumstance Hangs heavy on th' horizon, till at length, In frantic paroxism, bellowing War Rouses the nations!âHere, th' effects we see; When usher'd to the constellated thrones, Beyond mortality, where seraphs dwell And pour instruction on th' illumin'd eye, The causes will be manifest. Till then, Mortals must stoop and silently adore. Whilst thus, around King Edward, Peace, her wand, Seem'd stretching forth, sudden the storm descends! A noise is heard, and the imperious shout Of multitude at hand! The door thrown wide, Earl Talbot enters in! His coat of mail, Batter'd, he wears, still mark'd with many a stream Of blood and vivid rust. His helmet off, His shiver'd spear, firm in his sinewy grasp, And his cheek batter'd: a wild spectacle, He to the King draws near. Edward exclaim'd âThy name, O man! by holy Mary's self, âEarl Talbot!â Talbot, bending, thus replied, Whilst deep astonishment, sat on each brow. âHeaven, for the brave, an unseen canopy, âSpreads, and protects them 'mid the storm of death. âLittle I deem'd, when, in the furious fray, â(With such repeated contact with men's skulls) âI ground my sword, up to the very hilt, âSo soon to stand, safe, save this scar or two, âBefore my monarch.â âTell thy tale, O Earl!â Edward exclaim'd.â What tidings dost thou bear? Talbot replied, âLlewellyn, our fierce foe, âFrom Severn, southward, lays the country waste. âGloster is hisâafter as brave defence, âAs ever few, with myriads, dared maintain.â âGloster!â cried Edward, âbuttress of our land! âThat hold, where valour on a bed of down, âLay languid, of itself impregnable, âSo I believed, till this disastrous hour.â Upon the Bishop, a dark frown he cast, Who, trembling, stood. âTell me,â the Monarch cried, âTalbot, declare! whence is thy castle fallen?â The Earl thus answer'd. âMonarch, here I stand. âIf I disgrace upon thine arms have brought, âBlot me from mortal sight. I ask not life. âBut if I have maintain'd my country's cause, âAnd like a warrior, jealous of his fame, âFought manfully, yielding with struggle hard, âGrant me thy pardon! Let me yet behold âThy smile and live.â âNoble!â the King exclaim'd. âI do regard thee still. Talbot speak on! âI know thy valour.â Thus the Earl replied. âWith patience hear me. I, the circumstance, âFull, must recount. My honor is at stake. âMy soul's best part. Silence would be unjust âAnd the diminished word, iniquitous, âBoth to the men, whose courage none may doubt, âAnd to myself.â âWhen tidings of the war, âReach'd Gloster, and that Cambria's Prince in arms, âThrough Powis march'd, scattering on every side, âDeath and destruction, I, my castle wards âStored well with sustenance; burnish'd my arms; âInspired with confidence the gallant band âWhich call'd me leader, and like men we stood âDefying all events. Each avenue âThat to the castle led, to all without âDenied admittance. Whilst we thus remain'd, âAlert and on the watch, most resolute, âTidings arrived, from our unsleeping spies, âThat Cambria thither sent her ravenous sons, âLed by Llewellyn's self, to take our towers, âE'en Gloster, by surprise. I laugh'd aloud.â âDost thou now laugh?â said Edward, whilst his brow Stood darken'd with a frown. âNot now, my Liege,â Answer'd the Earl. âI waited with firm front, âThe approach of those presumptuous visitants, âResolved on equal combat and fair fight. âFar other views Llewellyn's heart sustain'd, âBase-born assassin! He the conference sought, âAnd, as I do suspect, meant, in the hour âOf unsuspecting parley, to direct âTowards me, the fatal dart. The brave naught dread. âTreachery alone instructs in cowardice. âI bade him bring his hordes, that dogs might feed. âThey came. And what a sight! not that I fear'd. âSmiling, I scann'd them, tho' their multitude, âMade e'en the herbaged heath, bladeless appear. âPrepared for their bold enterprise, they brought âAll instruments of slaughter and offence.â âI sorrow for the bravery now no more! âHeroes and Demi-Gods, sleep, still, in death! âThey came, e'en all their myriads, with their boughs, âA moving forest. Lo! our mote they reach! âAnd tho' our archers and our javelin-men, âOutstripp'd mortality in valourous deeds, âThey fill'd it, and now stood, breathing out death, âBeneath our battlements. Then was the strife! âWith countless ladders they ascend the walls! âWe met them, and with pike and falchion true âHurl'd them, like emmets, for their multitude, âDown to their graves below. In vain we strive! âNew ranks press onward, and, at length, O King, âMy gallant men, and braver never breath'd, âLay dead around me. I that day devour'd, âWith my resistless sword, three-score and three âWrathful assailants, but, in vain; they pour'd âNew torrents, and at length they scaled our walls. âNow was the hotter fight! Our dwindled few, âAll heroes, in the outer court, then stood, âCompact as adamant. O'erpower'd at length âEach cried for quarter. Tho' my final lance âStood, shiver'd in my handâBehold it here! âMy soul disdain'd the supplicating voice; âWhen, with my wounds grown desp'rate, I espied âLlewellyn near me, and that instant rush'd, âE'en with my broken lance, to deal his fate. âI wounded him! He fled! The shades of night âNow gather'd, when beholding all things lost, âI deem'd it no detraction from my fame, âTo save my life and liberty. With speed âI hasten'd to the wall. Down in the moat, âHead-long I plunged, thus iron'd as I was, âAnd by the fortune which the brave attends, âMangled as thus thou seest, unhelm'd, unarm'd, âEscaped miraculous. One thing I heard âFrom that foul tiger of the Cambrian hills, âLlewellyn, just when I forsook the fight, âExclaim'd âNo quarter!â and the piercing shrieks, âThe parting groans, of my poor countrymen, âJust perishing, still sound in these mine ears. âO Monarch, in that day, save me alone, âThy subjects were all murder'd!â Edward cried. âNow for the Hostages. To Ludlow Ludlow Castle in Shropshire. The residence of the Lords Presidents of the Marches, where they resided with the splendour of royalty. speed! âNot one shall live! Warren! my herald thou! âHaste! and thy spirit from compassion steel! âDrag them in fetters to thy Monarch's sight! âTheir heads and carcasses shall grace our towers; âThat be my consolation!â Warren turned, Bending obedient at his Monarch's words, And instant sought the death-doom'd Hostages. Earl Talbot's tidings now again recurr'd. The King and his bold Barons call'd to mind Each circumstance. The vision of the fight, With all its dread concomitants, appears Before their mental gaze; and still they stand, Vacant their eyes, their hands upon their swords, Intent, on their presumed realities, Till Edward cried, staying their airy flight, âTalbot! thy hurricane intelligence âO'erwhelms me. For the murder'd men I mourn. âPeace, late, was my design, and amity âWith Cambria's Prince. The momentary guest âNow do I spurn! The gory staff of war âEdward shall now unfurl, and death alone, âOr given, or received, inflexible, âConclude the contest waged by England's Lord! âMourn not thy fate, good Earl. I honor thee! âThou art unfortunate, tho' valourous still. âThou didst thy duty. Scenes will soon arise âWhere we shall need thy valour and advice. âBe not dismay'd, Edward is still thy friend. âBut let me ask; these wounds upon thy cheek âThey seem not recent.â At the sudden words, Unlook'd for, Talbot even blush'd. Alike, At some peculiar season and apt hour, Both shame and innocence one garb may wear. Whilst his heart curs'd the axe of Warwick's Earl, Prompt in reply, he answer'd. âKnow, O King! âIt is not my delight to talk of feats, âAnd valourous deeds, by my own might achieved; âYet, I must tell thee, ere that fatal day, âWhich gave my home, my castle to the foe, âA boar, from the Westphalian solitudes âI had obtain'd, and eager for the chase, âAppointed, with the neighbouring knights, a day âTo hunt the monster. English boars are tame. âThey give no scope for the intrepid lance. âI sought some noble triumph, o'er a foe, âWorthy of valour, and from German wilds âObtained a boar, fierce as the arctic bear, âWhose tusks, like steeple pinnacles arose âPalling the gazer. This was my delight. âWe let him loose. Safe, 'mid his kindred woods, âHe wander'd till the day of sport arrived. âIn that ill-fated hour, poor Lexington âA valiant knight, perish'd, while by his side âDe Tracy lay and gallant Molineux, âTwo squires renown'd. The savage brute defied âAll power of steel, and he who dared approach âCame to his death. Now is my time, I cried. âAt the first thrust, I pierced his iron flank. âHe slew my horse. I met him with my sword, âSingly, I laid him breathless on the ground; âBut in the contest, with his monstrous fangs âHe scarr'd my cheek. Now mark me, noble King. âThis wound just healing, in the deathful fray, âHeld with Llewellyn, met unnumber'd blows, âAnd gash'd and bare it lay. Nature howe'er âPerform'd her healing energies, and now, âHeedless of vanish'd scenes, I meet thy smile, âAnd am prepared to seek new roads to fame.â Edward replied. âTalbot, full well I know âThy prowess, and thy valour in the chase. âTo thee, I owe my life. Thou slew'st the boar âFoaming with rage, when Edward vanquish'd lay. âThy crest henceforth, the rampant boar shall be.â The Arms of many persons, particularly in ancient times, were derived from some remarkable circumstance in their lives. Those who had killed, in foreign climes, a lion or a leopard or a boar, very naturally added (by especial permission) these charges to their paternal arms. The saltier and cross evidently refer to the crusades, to which were often superadded the escallop-shell, the humble cup of Crusaders, carried by them in their hats; with the various orders of roundlets, particularly the besant, (a gold coin of Constantinople, deriving its name from Byzantium, the name of the city before Constantine the Great removed the seat of empire there, and gave it his own name.) Those who had survived the wars in Africa and Palestine, and had been so happy as to kill a Moor or a Saracen, added their heads, as a trophy to their arms, to which in some instances were added a bloody hand. These emblems mark the inveterate spirit subsisting, in those days, between the Infidels and Christians. It might be suspected that the belligerents of our own island were not, on some occasions, much more placable, for we find that the arms of Ednyfed Vychen (the ancestor of Owen Tudor) were, gules, a cheveron, between three Englishmen's heads, proper couped. Talbot look'd up and meditated words Denoting gratitude, when Edward cried, âNow higher thoughts demand observances. âBishop! Attend!â The good Archbishop rais'd, Languid, his eye, and met the anger-glance Of Edward, piercing to his heart and reins. âTo doubt thy loyalty, that were unjust. âThro' all thy days, fidelity, I own, âAnd wisdom, have been thine; but thou art made âOf stuff too tender. Far from guile thy self, âIn this our world, so hollow and so false, âThou deal'st thy liberal charity around âIn full libations. Didst thou, Talbot, hear? âWhere is thy confidence, told with stout words? âWhere is Llewellyn now?ââRound Snowdon's base, âWaiting the issue of thy mission here, âAnd seeking amity, yea, from his soul, âDesiring only right!â Thou didst believe âTh' insidious Prince and I a convert stood âBy thy persuasionâeven peace approved, âWith one who held the olive, budding fair, âExtended from his hand, and at that hour, âThat moment, unsuspected, aimed the blow âThe dagger at my heart. Grey-headed man âPrepare thine ear, for sounds of dissonance! âStrengthen and fortify thy inmost soul, âAnd stand unmoved at my heart-harrowing words. âLlewellyn is my foeâeternally! âOn his devoted head, my wrath shall light. âThe moment is pass'd by, when, from my mind, âI might have wrung forgetfulness and own'd âFeelings of amity.âFriendshipâavaunt! âNow for the strife of men! Warriors, renown'd! âGird on your sword! Nerve with fresh confidence âYour arm for slaughter! Vengeance be your cry! âThe current, for a moment held at bay âFlows on with fiercer vehemence.âI swear âTo conquer Cambria!â At the furious word, The Bishop sighed, clasping his aged hands, Whilst all the warriors round, in th' gust of wrath, Shouted aloud, âTriumph, or death be ours!â Earl Mortimer, advancing spake, âO King âWe hail thy high resolve. Cambria must fall. âHer zenith is pass'd by. Her hour is come, âHer doom is near, and when she perisheth, âAnd then alone, England will lift her head, âConcenter'd in herself, august, supreme, âAnd bid defiance to a world in arms.â Earl Pembroke spake, âO King! our hearts, our lives, âAll that we have lie prostrate at thy feet. âLlewellyn, Prince by name, altho' in heart âBase-born Plebeian, now, at length, shall know âThe wrath of England, her full blast of ireâ âWhen, rising in her lion majesty, âShe plunges on her prey.â Edward exclaim'd, âPrepare for war! Upon the coming morn, âWe will our passage force, and rest our spears, âDauntless, on Cambria.â As he spake, he turn'dâ He saw the Prelate. On his cheek, a tear Glisten'd, as to the earth, mournful, he look'd. Edward, the shooting pang of conscience felt, When he beheld his hoary-headed friend, Long known and faithful, his sage counsellor, Sorrow oppress'd. Remembering the harsh words, Just utter'd, in the gust of passion strong, He felt remorse, anguish that touch'd his soul: He could have wept, and now, with accent soft, Thus to the Bishop spake. âThou art a friend, âBelieve me! whom I love. Hear thou thy Prince. âTho' thy advice I spurn, I spurn not thee: âThy one great crime is virtue in excess;â âTrusting to one whose rooted perfidy âNone might suspect, the substance of whose heart, âIs falsehood tangible. Few know to deal âWith that most treacherous and soul-wither'd man. âYet would my words, alone, be mild to thee. âThou totterest o'er the grave; before thou go'st âTo th' mansions of the blest, thy proper home, âEven pardon me! Let us renew once more, âWarm from the heart, friendship's old covenant. âShould I defer, when next I seek for thee, âThe tear may tell that I have sought too late.â The Bishop cried, âHeaven's blessing on thee rest!â Edward, with ardour spake, âOn thine own head âThy blessings are return'd. Thou good old man, âThy cautions and advice; thy love of peace; âThy maxims which refer t' a better world, âTho' dormant, are not lost. They may arise âHereafter, in the still and thoughtful hour âWhen reason will be heard, and minister âChoice consolations, of worth infinite, âWhich shall prepare me for that state, where thou, âAnd all pure spirits, meet to part no more.â The good old Prelate bow'd. âMy Son!â he said, â(Pardon thy servant's voice familiar,) âIf well to thee it seem, nor burdensome, âWith a few righteous men, faithful to me, âI will attend thy course. It is my wish; âMy prayer most fervent.â Edward cried, âTill death. âRefreshment in thy presence, best of men, âAttend me, yea, be still my counsellor; âWith thee in sight, I shall feel confidence, âThe atmosphere thou breathest, must be fair.â BOOK X. SCENE, Chester. Before the earliest dawn, a Cambrian Chief, At Chester's massy gate, stood and required, With voice austere, and vehemence of speech, An audience of the King. The Sentinel Demanded what his object and his name. The stranger answer'd. âSaxon, For centuries after the union of Cambria with England, it was common for the Welsh to designate the English by the name of Saxons. In the unfrequented parts of Wales, the custom is not unknown in the present day. tell thy Prince âA Cambrian of high birth seeks conference. âHaste! nor thus hesitate.â The night was chill And the Old Sentinel ill brook'd the voice Thus haughty, and the opprobrious Saxon name. No word direct he spake, but, leisurely His greaves adjusted, pondering how to act, Or what to say, to the insulting man, Most efficacious of his high disdain. Doubtful the path; when, stamping hard his spear Upon the ground, as the resolve arose, And to keep up his spirit to the point, Frowning, he hasten'd to the grated space, And with resentful eye, aloud exclaim'd, âWarrior! or high or low, I heed thee not. âWait thou my pleasure!â As the Cambrian's sword Half left its sheath, the grey-hair'd sentinel Muttering faint curses turn'd to seek the King. Edward had burst the slumbers of the night And with his chieftains, communed now, and plann'd The conduct of the war, when at the door The sentinel appear'd and spake. âA man, âHot-headed, of so fierce a tone and look, âStands at our gate and claims to see our King, âThat I bethink, ere we can let him in, âHis very eyes, like a consuming star, âWill burn our bars and buttresses of stone âE'en to a cinder. Cambrian fierce as death.â âAdmit him!â Edward cried. Into the hall The stranger enters. To the King he stalks, And Edward thus address'd. âO King, in me, âBehold, Prince David!â Wondering each beheld, When Edward cried. âDeclare thy message here!â âI come,â the Prince replied, ânot to convey âWords from Llewellyn, but to offer thee âMy own true service.â Edward spake, âExplain! âWhat meanest thou?â David thus answer made. âIn Cambria's ancient code, there is a law, âHeld sacred, of so clear and just a kind, âThat since great Roderic ruled, bravest of men! âFew hardy minds have dared to violate âIts holy sanctions. This high testament, âDeclares, that ever when a Cambrian Prince âSleeps with his fathers, his surviving sons âShall equally th' inheritance divide, âSharing alike his patrimonial lands. The law of Gavel-kind, enacted an equal division of property, between children. This law prevailed among the Ancient Britons, and which, from being continued by the Welsh, weakened their national strength, and contributed greatly towards their final subjugation. âWhen Griffith died, Llewellyn seized his crown. âScarce had the breath, from my poor aged sire âEscaped, and given his spirit to the bless'd, âEre, with a ravenous thirst of power supreme, âLlewellyn, my false brother, laid his hands âAlike on Gwyned, Powis, Dinevawr, âAnd call'd himself, Prince of the Cambrian States. âHumble, tho' resolute, I claim'd my part. âHe answer'd, with the specious sophistry âFalsehood invents. âStay till the war hath ceas'd. âWhen this our land, from the entangling foe, âHath burst, and rear'd her lofty head, once more âOn her old independence, I will shew âThat justice, not ambition is my law.â âI answered, âmy clear right, withhold it not. âThe lion hath his paw, the wolf his fang.â âHe answer'd, striving to keep down my ire, ââPatience, my brother, Edward is our foe. âThe congregated sinews of our land âFirst must be brought to a courageous proof. âOne head must dictate now, one sceptre sway.â âIn vain the waves assault the rocky shore; âI left him. Brother he is none to me. âThe love which nature taught, which once I felt âWith all the ardour of young innocence, âNow is converted to aversion, fix'dâ âImperishable hate and deadly scorn. âI tear the latent feeling from my heart. âI swear myself his fiercest enemy. âEdward! I know thy noble character. âNot from the sudden impulse, but, deep thought, âFrom inference calm and permanent resolve, âLeave I my country, I disdain her cause! âDavid, the Brother of Llewellyn, fled into England and joined his interest with that of Edward. Tho' levity of temper and a turbulent spirit for a long time influenced this Prince, a ray of returning virtue brightened the declining period of his life.ââWarrington. âOn one condition, and on one alone, âI offer thee my service and my life. âThou art too wise, upon Llewellyn's faith, âTo rest, with the slight pressure of a straw. âAmbitious, faithless, of his father's fame âUnmindful, and to sacred justice lost, âHe meditates stupendous scenes of strife, âAnd would deprive, e'en of their dearest rights, âTheir constituted liberties and laws, âAll Cambrians, high and low. Vain to contend, âI fled the tiger, for I knew his force, âBut I retire only to arm myself âWith thundering terrors and effective wrath. âEdward! whilst o'er our land Llewellyn reigns, âThere is no peace for England. Well I know âHis restless and aspiring appetites, âHis passion for dominion, his high looks, âAnd feverish thirst, to rid, as he declares, âThis island, of the rude Barbarians, âThe Saxons, even thee! Mark thou my words, âIf thou, with thy brave warriors, wilt advance âInto the heart of Cambria, and compel âLlewellyn to renounce the crown he wears, âAnd place it on my head, then shalt thou gain âA friend more firm than the primeval rock. âYea, I will hold dominion at thy hands; âTo thee, as to my rightful potentate âSwear fealty and allegiance, and henceforth âPeace shall subsist where warfare dwelt before.â Edward one moment paus'd; sudden he cried, Oppress'd with joy. âBrave Prince for prowess famed âAnd soldier-like exploits, 'mid Chester's walls, âI welcome thee. A host is thy support. âThou hast reposed thy confidence in one âWho knows not to betray. Thee will I make âInstant, a Knight, the presage of my smiles âAnd highest favour. Thou wilt then become âSon of a new and nobler hemisphere.â David approaching bow'd. The deed is done. And now he stands, exulting in the name, An English subject and an English Knight. Sometimes a person received the honor of knighthood, by simply kneeling, and receiving, from his superior, a touch with the point of a sword on his head, but this was chiefly confined to the field of battle, or where circumstances did not admit of a longer process. On other occasions it was made a formal ceremony. When Geoffrey Duke of Normandy was knighted, his arms were brought to him in great state: he was deliberately invested with an incomparable coat of mail, wrought with double chains or links of iron, so closely interwoven that it was impenetrable to the point of a spear or arrow. The chausses, or boots of mail, were made also with double chain-work. These were presented to him, with a pair of gilt spurs which were put on his feet. This done, a shield was hung on his neck, ornamented with lions of gold; an helmet richly decorated with precious stones, and so well tempered that no sword could make any impression upon it, was set upon his head; a lance was then brought to him, made of oak, and surmounted with a head of iron of Poictou; and lastly a sword was presented to him from the royal treasury. Thus equipped he went forth a noble knight. Whilst David smiled with joy, Edward thus spake. âWith thee, I know Llewellyn's faithlessness: âThou dost conceive of him as I have found. âTo 'stablish concord and firm amity âBetween our realms, jarring from age to age, âThee will I serve, thy cause alone espouse, âAnd I will place thee on thy father's throne.â David replied. âMagnanimous as great! âI honour thee, first and most wise of men! âThe full completion of my hopes is come. âDavid shall reign. My father's crown I feel âPressing my brow, and, 'mid the abject dust, âBehold Llewellyn, naked, and the scorn âOf my disdainful subjects and of me. âNor deem my service light as is the air. âI have full many friends in Powis-land, âSubstantial friends, devoted, who will rise âIn David's cause, and pour a flood of wrath âOn my base brother. They require alone âMy voice, to rise in arms, and emulate âTheir ancient glory; Valour's darling sons.â Edward replied. âDavid, our cause is one. âPrompt energy must mark our character, âAnd our resolves be quick as passing light. âSpeed to thy distant friends! Tell them from me, âMy object is, to hurl Llewellyn down, âAnd, to his throne, thyself to elevate. âThat, 'tween our jarring realms, peace may prevail. âThis morn I lead my warriors to the Dee, âWhich, having cross'd, I pierce the Cambrian land, âSeeking the foe, resolved by martial feats, âTo scourge him into reason, but, too late âTo save his honour, or secure his crown. âBrave David, an important part is thine. âHaste to thy friends. Urge them by arguments, âResting on Edward's faith, to rise in armsâ âFor thee alone, and to establish, firm, âConcord between us. Having Powis roused, âAnd fired with valour, bear me thy support âWhere'er the current of the war may lead.â David saluted the extended hand; And now full confident, his course pursues, Toward Powis, to collect his valiant friends. The morn now came. To Saltney's Marsh, A large Marsh, near Chester, extending into Flintshire. at hand, Thro' the huge gate, the English forces pour All confident, and panting for the war. The baron and the knight, in glittering mail, Earnest, pass'd onward, and, at length, his spear, Edward exalted. To the door he march'd, Then turning, gazed at the baronial hall Where the first Lupus banqueted, and spread The far-famed Norman hospitality. The King, beholding, cried. âWhen the wars ceased, â'Tween William and his subjects, Saxon born, âThis Hall, from the carousing multitude, âFat Lupus âHugh Lupus built a Hall suitable to his hospitality. He is said to have been, not only liberal, but profuse. He kept no account of receipts and disbursements, and âwas much fonder of huntsmen and stout eaters than he was of cultivators of the land and holy men.â By his gluttony he became so fat, as to be wheeled backward and forward to his banquets.ââPennant. âHugh Lupus was kinsman of William the Conqueror, and received from him the Earldom of Chester. His descendants becoming extinct, in the reign of Henry III. it reverted to the crown, and Henry bestowed it on his son Edward, from which time the Earldom of Chester is one of the titles always bestowed on the King's Eldest Son.â âSir John Dodridges' Account of the Earldom of Chester. at their head, made the air ring âWith its loud merriments; yet, once again, âHaply, the song may rise, when we have hurl'd âLlewellyn to the dust.â This said, the King Press'd onward to salute his marshall'd bands. As thus he speeds, a voice is heard behind, Never surpass'd in tone and tenderness By Pity, when, from cheering Sorrow's child, She turns, and soft inquiresâWho else is sad?â Once more to bid adieu, it is the Queen! E'en Ellen, bathed in anguish-telling tears, And hastening toward her Lord! Edward, his step, Checks, and, with open arms, receives his pride. They speak not. The firm grasp; the trembling frame; The glowing cheek; the palpitating heart, All plead, nor claim the vain-repeated word, Where Nature spake. Again their arms relax. They part, and, silent, now, the Queen retires. Edward beheld her, whilst domestic joys, And home's calm sweets, before his gaze, appear'd, All lovely, and the Warrior half unarm'd. At length he cried. âTho' fame and high exploits, âEarnest, I seek, and never England's King âLifted the spear in juster cause, or felt âMore motives of imperious character, âTo rouse his spirit, a mild voice within âWhispers of peace. Forms of delight arise, âScarce lawful, in an hour so big with fate. âMy thoughts will turn to her, of Woman-kind âFirst and most excellent, who, for her Lord, âGave proof of her affection, in an hour âSo perilous. O, wherefore didst thou call âThese hostile images, yet are they dear. âI must, with speed, tread my ethereal way, âOr yield. I cannot long the Alien prove. âThe Eagle with bold pinion mounts aloft, âFar out of sight, cleaving his trackless course, âYet he descends far swifter, pausing notâ âHe has his Home on earth and so have I.â This said, the Monarch hastens to the field. Edward always entertained great affection for his Queen. She accompanied him on his expedition into Scotland, where he went to decide which of the two competitors (Baliol or Bruce) had the superior claim to the throne of Scotland. On their arrival at Derby, the Queen died, when the inconsolable Monarch had her remains carried to Westminster, and at every place at which the body stopped, he ordered a sumptuous cross to be erected. âThe crosses erected were, at Charing by Westminster, in Westcheape of London, at Waltham in Essex, at St. Albanes in Hartfordshire, at Dunstable, at Stony-stratford, at Northampton, at Woborne and Grantham.ââStow. The circumstances of Edward having been wounded by an assassin, in Palestine, with the magnanimity of his Queen in sucking out the poison, are thus described. âThe Saracens found out a fit person to engage in the assassination of Edward. The man had been brought up under ground, to make him the more daring, and to keep him from adopting any sentiments of humanity by conversing with other mortals. This wretch, either bringing letters from the Admiral to introduce him to the Prince, or else insinuating himself into the family by speaking French, and pretending he had some important secret to cqmmunicate, got admittance to the King when he was alone in his chamber, and shutting the door after him, he thought the opportunity favourable for his execrable design. It was on Friday, in Whitsun-week, June 17th, the weather very hot, and the Prince sitting on the bed in a loose vest, when the Assassin, drawing on a sudden a poisoned dagger from under his girdle, attempted to stab him in the belly, but the Prince, attempting to parry it with his arm received there a deep wound, and striking up the villain's heels with his foot, seized the dagger and plunged it in his heart. The Prince's Servant, hearing a noise, broke into the room, and taking a jointstool, dashed out the Assassin's brains, not without a severe reprimand from Edward for striking a Dead Person.ââCarte's England. âBy reason of the envenomed blade, the wounds were feared to be mortal, wherein the Lady Elenor gave so rare example of conjugall affection, as her immortal memory doth justly impart glory to that whole Sex. For when no medicine could extract the Poison, shee did it with her tongue, licking dayly, while her Husband slept, his rankling wounds, whereby they perfectly closed, and yet her selfe received no harme; so sovereigne a medicine is a Wife's Tongue anointed with the virtue of lovely affection.ââSpeed. It was a glorious morn. The sun on high, With many a floating cloud of liquid gold Cheer'd the beholder. Silent was the air. The leaves were sleeping in their hour of joy, Whilst the gay swallow, darting now on high, Now skimming the smooth earth and wantoning, In the satiety of happiness, Just stirr'd, with gentle motion, the lull'd heart, And made it more alive to sympathies That dived into the soul, caught from the sceneâ The tranquillizing scene of all around. Each baron brave, as parts of his own self, Marshall'd his vassals. O'er th' extended plain, Ranks follow'd ranks, glittering with armour fair, Spears and steel chaplets, falchions burnish'd bright, Halbert and bill and battle-axe, and bow, Gorget and gauntlet, whilst the sheaf behind Teem'd with the barbed dart. So brave a host Never had England sent to scourge her foe, Spain, Gallia, Brabant, Cambria, or, 'mid hills, Where Caledonia's hardy sons abode. At Edward's summons, thro' th' extended realm Each warrior, from brief moments of repose, Woke, and his armour braced, and fix'd his heart To strive with Cambria's lance and Cambria's fame. It was the tidings which their hearts adored: Each panted for the day, whilst man to man Talk'd of the war and its triumphant end. They seem'd a marching nation. Knight and squire, And baron, and brave earl, joyful advancedâ From barrier Tweed, to Fowy's southern flood; From Coquet, Wensbeck, Derwent, Tyne and Wear, From Esk and Eden, Petril, Wampool, Irt, Ken, Ehen, Wyre, Ribble and Alt and Teese. Here Mersey too, his hardy warriors sent, With that slow creeping, graceless tide abhorr'd, Dane, utter'd not by England, without curse, And dread remembrances. Old Humber too, Sire of a hundred streams! sent his bold sons; From Owse and Swale, and Yare, and Wharfe and Don, And his first born, stout Trentâa Progeny Base and unfilial, who, their aged Sire, Have forced (progressively, advancing still, As he retreats,) e'en to the ocean's verge! There deep intrench'd, his veteran front he shews, And in the winter of his days, puts forth The nerve of manhood.âProsperous be thy cause Sire of a hundred streams! Witham and Louth, Wensum and Lynn and Yare, Blyth, Glen and Alde, Too pour'd their champions, with sweet-flowing Cam, And Soar and Nen and Hiz, Deben and Colne, Medway and Mole, Lee, Cherwell, Isis fair, With him the pride and glory of the land, Old Father Thames, Crouch, Kennet, Rother, Frome, And triple Avon, urged their sons to war; With Ader, Itching, Otter, Welyborne, Nadder and Arun, Anton and young Stoure; Axe, Bruce and Parret, Exe and Barle and Taw, Plym, Tavy, Torridge, Tidy, There is a remarkable alliteration in some of the rivers of South Wales. To the great confusion of the traveller, the following are found within a small compass. Tovy Towa Tawy Towy Tivy Tave. These names bear a resemblance to the Cornish rivers, Taw, Tavy, and Tidy. I am induced to mention the distinction, or the reader might otherwise suppose, that I had enumerated, in the text, some of the Welsh rivers. and that stream Of matchless grace and beauties prominent, Tamer, the boast of England's southern shore. All these, at Edward's voice, sent their sons forth, Equipt for combat. Num'rous was the host That now in war array throng'd round their King. There Hungerford upraised his banner proud, And Dodingsale and the Lord Latimer, Le Zouch, and Courtney, Lifford's potent Lord, With Lacy, Lincoln's Earl, Ralf Mortimer, De Knighton, Monmouth, Langley, Montague, Robert De Burgh and Reginauld De Bruce, Tiptoft, with Essex and with Chester's Lords, Walter De Clifford, Audley, Basset, Pointz, Fitz Peter and Hugh Vaughan, Richard De Clare, The young Montalto, Lenox, Pembroke's Earl, Fitz Mathew, Bedford, Stanly, Venables, With John De Grey, and Warren's lofty Earlâ (He, who when call'd by high commissioners, Greedy of gold, to prove his title deed To all his wide domains, boldly replied, Sending dismay into the listener's heart, âO men! my titles and my words are briefâ âMy father, with this sword, conquer'd his lands, âAnd with the self-same instrument, this arm âShall still defend them.â) âCommissioners were appointed in the reign of Edward I. to examine the Titles by which the Barons and others held their lands. These Commissioners, by a vigorous exertion of their authority, gave great trouble and vexation to many; but a stop was put to their inquiries, by the boldness of Earl Warren, who appearing before these Commissioners and being desired to produce the instruments, by which he held his Estates, drew an old rusty sword out of its scabbard, and said, âThis is the instrument by which my Ancestors gained their estates, and by which, as long as I live, I will keep them.â This answer being reported to Edward, he wisely revoked the commission.ââHenry. Dugdale however observes, that Edward was induced to dissolve the commission, not from the simple opposition of Earl Warren, but because âthe rest of the Nobles then present, concurred therein,â which better reconciles Edward's acknowledged firmness, with the casual though politic renunciation of his design. The same writer mentions an anecdote of Earl Warren which exhibits his determined spirit. Warren had quarrelled with Sir Alan la Zouch about the right to certain lands, and, finding it probable that the law would decide it against him, in the midst of his wrath he happened to meet Sir Alan and his Son in Westminster Hall: âwhereupon having first passionately vented himself in foul language, he at length assaulted them with such violence that he almost killed the one and much wounded the other.â Warren was fined ten thousand marks for this misdemeanor, but his native bravery always rendered him a favourite with Edward, which was manifested amongst other evidences, by the special precept that the King issued on Warren's death, requiring the Bishop of London throughout his whole Diocese, to pray for and grant indulgences for âthe goode of his soul.â With the rest appear'd Talbot impatient of the near campaign; Beauchamp and Berkely, Chandos, Dunstanville, Juliers, and Albemarle, Grenvill and Scroope, Ferriers, Maubray, Nevile and Cavendish, Lucie and Lutterell, Mandevill and Scales, Howard and Percie, Stafford, the Lord Strange, Finch, Arnulf, Vipount, Audley, Boteler, Beaufort and Brandon, Byron, Grevill, Hyde, Clarence, Fitz Osborne, Arlington and Hay Dacres and Digby, Eltham, Monke and Morle, Fitz Piers, Montgomerie, Littleton and Fane, Paget and Paulet, Rutland, Leigh and Pole, With Poynings, Seymour, Rivers. These appear'd With countless more, barons and knights and squires, Panting to lift the spear and hurl the lance. War now appear'd, dress'd in his gayest garb, A spectacle of glory, half allied To lower deities. The eye that saw Gazed with admiring stedfastness, and felt Idolatry steal to the willing heart: Such was his port august. Amid the scene, All winning forms were manifest. Proud plumes Danced in the air; the playful banner waved; âThe glittering spear, firm from the ground, uprais'd, And burnish'd helm, and gorget, caught the beams, (The sun, in his effulgence scatter'd round,) And dazzled the rapt eye. O'er the wide scene, Thus teeming with delight, each man display'd His richest wardrobe, gay as summer flies: And whilst the lulling music fills the air With concords and sweet sounds, in ecstasy The warrior drinks th' intoxicating draught, And reels with happiness. Ah! what a change And sudden transformation War displays, Arch Hypocrite! Now with the dove-like voice He calls the thoughtless to his banner proud, Displays his rich appurtenance, and dress Gorgeous as Autumn, bids them sip the bowl, On some peculiar holiday brought forth, And taste a Hero's fare. They taste and laugh! Brief insect happiness! a few short days, And cold experience robs them of their joy. What form is that, which limping lags along, Unknown of all? His friends he passes by, Unnoticed. Bending to the earth he stoops, And mourns in silence, longing for that place, The last sad antidote of misery! Can it be War? whose head so late appear'd Lofty as Atlas, and whose look, alone, Wander'd among the stars? Can this weak frame, The ghost of manhood, be the potent Prince Whose voice the thunders drown'd, and whose command Extended to the earth's remotest verge, And Nations roused from slumber, to attend His march triumphant? Ah! his helm appears, No longer doubtful, War our pity claimsâ Fall'n Potentate! We saw thee in the hour When thou wast young and graceful, and our eyes Feasted upon thy form immaculate, Whilst, with thy crowd of Sycophants, we too Pay'd thee our homage, and believed thy name, And thy repute, ordain'd, till time expired, To live, the idol of a subject world.â The mountain is transform'd to hillock small! Combat hath weaken'd thee! Thy blood hath flow'd, Haply, in other cause than equity. Hard fare, hard lodging, night, the hour of rest, Oft broken, and unceasing watch and toilâ Now, combating with the rude elements, Now, with the foe, hath bent thy lofty head, Quench'd thy fierce spirit, and thy ghastly eyes Fix'd on the charnel house.âWe know thee not. Thy alter'd state an alter'd voice demands. Go! and conceal with kindred multitudes. Thy scar-crown'd head! Go! and before thou diest, And slumber'st with the myriads now no more, (Forgotten, tho' each hoped, some tablet proud, Like thee, might bear his valour and his name, To after ages, e'en to farthest time,) Whilst yet the lamp of being dimly burns, Go! make thy peace with God! O'er the vast plain, Where now the English legions spread themselves, And thought on war, as on a rich repast Where they might banquet, many a bounding heart Exultant felt, only because his eyes Pierced not futurity! A wat'ry mist, A veil of gossamer, oft hides the fate, Adjacent, like a near and pendent dart, Whilst pale humanity, shuddering, looks on. Regardless of the cloud, gathering at hand, Full many a noble brother there appear'd, Too soon ordain'd to wring the bitter tear From the fond sister. There the lover stood, Destin'd to feed War's ravenous appetite, E'en he who late, with tenderness supreme, Sooth'd the sad Maid (whose palpitating heart Foreboded evil) with the valiant feats His arm must first achieve, ere he reclined Upon the lap of Love.âThere many a man, (His Wife's best treasure) who, so late, had lull'd Each rising fear, and talk'd of fame and arms And the rewards of honorable toil, Press'd to his speedy end. Few suns shall rise Ere these shall bid adieu to all below; Nor, once again, around the hearth of peace, Speak comfort to their soul's best part, thenceforth, Widow'd and sad, into whose inmost soul, The night-winds fierce shall sink, and seem the shrieks Of the still-hovering spirits they adore. Amid that mighty concourse, many a Sire Look'd on with an inspiring confidence, To honor and repose, destin'd erelong To close his eyes, and bid a last farewell To earth and all he prized. Amid the rest, One Father stood, noble, endued with gifts, And virtues, 'bove life's current excellence, A baron of high name. Few days have pass'd Since Latimer, breathing affection true, Beheld his Offspring, rising up like plants, Of divers age, and regular, all fair; One, reaching manhood, one, the tender shoot, In life's gay morn, just raising its green head Above the turf, and promising bright flowers Erelong to open.âTake thy last adieu! Once more bestow a fond and fervent look, No second shall return. Thy spirit feed With the luxurious food! Lay by thy plumes, And on a father's knee, take thy mild babes, Call them sweet names, (still sweeter in thy heart) And pardon'd be the tear that then may flow.â The moment is pass'd by! The struggle o'er! And save when truant fancy (welcome still Tho' oft rebuff'd) lingers, like closing eve O'er scenes beloved, and catches a fond glance, Harmonious, in the distance of the mind, Earl Latimer, noblest of english knights, Thinks only of fair fame and war and arms. The trumpet's bray is heard! The march begins! The shores of Dee they reach! They cross; and now, Triumphant and with hearts elate and bold; Rest their tall spears, firm on the Cambrian land. BOOK XI. SCENE, Edward's entrance of Cambria. Thro' the whole host, joy, like a cordial ran, When, on the hostile shore, the English stood, Defying Cambria: yet, altho' they felt, Unshrinking confidence, they call'd to mind, With something of stern aspect, and a soul Inclined to seriousness, the valourous feats Cambria had shewn, when in the years pass'd by She drove th' Invaders from her mountain wilds, Like chaff before the whirlwind. Well they knew How John, young Arthur's murd'rer, with designs, Not less vindictive and matured in thought, Invaded Cambria, sending his loud threats Upon the winged storm, and scorning aught But a submission, abject, and a knee Bent to the earth, till from his haughty dreams, He woke in wild dismay, and, fleeing, left The wreath of glory, for the crown of shame. Great as they were, the English for their foe Felt forced respect, for they, too, call'd to mind, How the third Henry, from the land of hills, And sons of liberty, once and again Fled, or retired with sullen majesty, From his impetuous foe, and sooth'd his mind, Sore with discomfiture, with distant hope, That yet the time might come, when, to the strife England should once again return, and wrench Subjection from the Cambrian's iron heart. Hast'ning to a near Barrow, Some future inquirer may perhaps be obliged by the following intimation. The writer of this poem, in the year 1800, visited the Roman Camp, lying on the brow of the hill, near Westbury, in Wiltshire, of which Camden has given the following notice. âNear the middle of the camp is a large oblong Barrow, under which have been found many human skulls and bones, mixed with stag's horns and pieces of ironweapons, and mill-stones, sixteen and eighteen inches in diameter.â On viewing the external appearance of the Barrow, there was no indication of its ever having been examined, and as Camden has not accompanied his remark with any authority which might satisfy the reader that he spake either from the evidence of another, or his own personal observation, the writer thought it possible that he might have spoken from tradition, and that it might not have been examined, or otherwise have been examined superficially, and therefore having obtained the permission and concurrence of the proprietor and the worthy clergyman of the parish, he had the Barrow opened, of which the following is briefly the result. The workmen cut a trench in the longest direction, and afterwards two transverse trenches. When they had descended about ten or twelve feet, they came to a thin layer of charcoal, (some of which has been preserved, and which, though small, is as dry and as perfect as though but recently burnt.) Immediately under the charcoal were found a great number of human bones, possessing nearly their natural solidity. It is to be observed, that after the workmen had cut through the thin layer of decayed vegetable mould, they came to successive strata of flint (embedded in chalk, their usual accompaniment) clay, and a marly kind of earth. The strata were about a foot thick, regular in their divisions, and all horizontal. This appearance, in an artificial mound, was unexpected, and so similar were the stratas, to the natural undisturbed state of the earth, that after the men had descended several feet, the writer was almost discouraged from proceeding further; a perseverance, however, for two or three more feet disclosed the few particulars before named. After descending below the level of the adjacent ground, and in different directions, and it not being likely that any thing more would be observed, the excavations were again filled up. The various Barrows which Dr. Stukeley examined on the Downs of Wiltshire, were all covered with a regular layer of flint partly decomposed, from the action of the atmosphere, into chalk. The sanctity attached to such mounds always preserves them from wanton dilapidation, whilst the sod, with which Nature soon invests them, from its vivifying and incorruptible property, seems to confer as much stability on these simple Cemeteries, as any thing human can boast. Edward cried, âNow is the time,â O Warriors! to confirm âYour country's character! Barons and Knights âApproach your Prince.â All duteous they draw near. With spirits firm as ever-during brass, And wait their monarch's words. Edward began. âBarons and potent Knights and valiant Squires, âUpholders of hereditary fame, âNext after God, your country's confidence, âRegard your King. Now on the Cambrian soil, âDauntless our spears we rest. Full in your ear, âLet me pour forth the motives which thus prompt âOur hands to war. Chieftains, full well you know âWhat laurels you have purchased, what renown, âOn Gallia's shores, on Afric's burning sands, âAnd from the Saracen, the Christian's shame! â'Mid holy Palestine. A harder strife, â(Not to depress your hearts but rouse your zeal, âSpeak I these words,) a harder strife is near. âCourage requires no falsehood to sustain âHis lofty head; self-confident, on Truth âHe loves to gaze, smooth or austere his brow. âNo contest vain is near, no pastime gay, â(When arms and banners, by loud Laughter's side âMake up the raree-shew,) solemn of heart, âWe now must meet our compeers, man to man, âAnd triumph crown, that cause, where reigns alone, âSuperior valour.âWell, remembrance tells âHow oft our march of glory hath been stay'd âBy Cambria's hardy sons, and England seen âThe crown at which she grasp'd, shrink from her hand, âAnd these rude mountaineers, bear it away, âExultant, to their holds and fastnesses. âYea, truth demands other acknowledgment. âWhen England's self, stoop'd to superior power, âCambria defied the Saxon. After times, âBrought o'er the Norman, whose victorious arm âPass'd thro' the land of our nativity, âAnd saw, all, vassals, save the stubborn race â'Gainst whom we now advance. Oft have our first âAnd bravest Princes, sought to crown their reign, âWith an achievement, which, to future years, âShould bear their names, crown'd with immortal wreaths. âThus breathing for renown, they raised their lance, âAnd Cambria's conquest was the song they sung. âShort-lived their triumph! like their ancestors, âWeary and sad, they measured back their steps, âConfusion in their front, and shame behind. âI see the kindling spark beam in your eyes. âYou utter with a look, half audible, âThis feat transcendent, this proud deed at arms, âWas left by men, less valiant, for ourselves!â âYes, noble host! the glory of this deed, âWhich shall transmit your name to after times, âEmbalm'd, with honors incorruptible, âAwaits your valour. For your favor'd selves âThis triumph was ordain'd. âI will not hide, âBrave men, from you, the workings of my mind. âOnce have I known defeat! that fatal hour âHangs on my soul, still, like a tower of lead. âTho' I have honours won, oft and not mean, âI felt them not. They were as idle tales, âIn which I found no part. Their influence âReach'd not my spirit. To myself I cried, âWhen hollow plaudits thunder'd in my ear, ââBut Edward once was worsted. On his head âDisgrace once lay. Till I erase that blot âAnd conquer my proud Victor, life to me, âAnd fame, are vacant things. I must expunge, âFrom the recording annals, of mankind, âEdward's deep shame.â At that ill-omen'd hour, âI swore a solemn oath, still ratified, âWhen morning dawn'd and at each closing eveâ âThat I would live, one object in my view, âAnd one aloneâCambria to subjugate âAnd blend her land with ours. Chieftains, revered! âBlushing, my past discomfiture I own.â âWhen Henry our late King, my reverenc'd Sire, âSent me, a stripling, (seventeen summer suns âScarcely alighting on my burnish'd mail) âTo meet the fierce Llewellyn, like a boy, âImpatient to possess the Hero's meed, âTho' of its cost unknowing, forth I went, âTo meet the furious warrior of the hills. âBrave were my forces, and my heart intent âTo gather from renown's high-arching trees, âFair fruits and flowers. All confident, I march'd; âI met the man abhorr'd. Here let me cease, âPregnant with dread disasters, in that hour, âMy sun was veil'd; my fame, just budding forth, âNipp'd by harsh frosts, I fled the field, to feed, â(What could I more to sooth discomfiture) âOn future conquests.âYoung in strife and arms, âI then resolved to bend my lofty head, âAnd like a young noviciate to acquire, â'Mid war, experience, that slow-growing plant. âWith the huge multitude of fighting men, âTo Palestine, I bounded on, and there, âMet oft the Soldan, dyed my faithful sword âIn blood of Infidel, and left behind âSome fame of fair exploit, hoping at last âTo achieve a nobler enterprize. My Sire, âDying, bequeath'd a crown. âAt the Coronation of King Edward, five hundred great Horses were turned loose, catch them who could.ââStow's Chron. On Syria's shore âI heard the tidings, and tho' tears I shed, âTrue filial tears! less poignant was my grief, âWhen I beheld, beyond the sable cloud, âA prospect, fairer than the evening sky, âThe consummated purpose of my soul, âE'en the approach of conflict and fierce strife, âWith my once victor foe. Fix'd was my heart; âYet I resolved to curb, and fetter down âMy spirit, till some deed, afresh, provoked, âJustly, my indignation. Forfeit fame, âTho' hard, I might endure, not so the thought âThat I had wantonly unsheath'd the sword, âAnd fill'd (with an accusing influence) âHeaven with the sufferers' groans. Firm was my oath âTo make the Prince, that higher character, âRepress the feelings of the Man. I fix'd âSolely, my eye upon my People's goodâ âOn Jutice, e'en to Cambria's haughty Prince, âAnd swore, to foster Peace, nor let slight grounds âRouse, from its calm repose, the Warrior's sword. âBut this disdainful foe pierces our land, âRound, scattering death. He will not let the spark âCalmly expire, late kindled in our breast. âThis Cambrian, fiercer than the arctic Bear, âHe will have war. No option left. Our wrath, âHe holds it light. Doubtless, contempt he feels âFor him, whom he hath vanquished; holding light âYoung Edward's prowess. By the sun on high, âI'll meet him sword to sword and hand to hand. âLlewellyn dares me to a second strife. âHis purpose told in language more distinct âThan noon-tide shadows, well I understand. âCould secret doubt yet hover o'er our mind, âCould we believe Cambria's desire of peace, âAnd blind our eyes, still, to our ravaged lands, âAnd castles rased, unwarn'd and unprovoked, âGloster would flash conviction on our souls. âThese rude aggressions move me but to joy. âThe very outrages, in other cause âWhich would arouse my spirit into storm, âSeeing they spread the gate and entrance give âTo warfare, once again, with Cambria's Prince, âI view rejoicing. Now, a second spear âEdward shall break. Brave and determined men, âWho now stand panting to support your fame, âMark this my oath. I, Edward, England's King, âDo swear, both in the sight of Heaven and Earth, âNever to sheath this sword, till at my feet, âProstrate, Llewellyn lies, and Cambria's land, âAfter bleak centuries of war and strife, âIs join'd, in an indissoluble bond, âWith England, Queen of Isles.â The warriors round, With vehemence, warm, flood-like, from the heart, Shouted, âThis oath be ours. We swear, alike, âTo conquer or to die.â Edward exclaim'd, âNow for the war of men. Earl Mortimer, âAttend our summons! From this rolling tide, âTo Snowdon, Cambria's bulwark, intervene âWoods and impervious forests. Oft our arms âHave been repell'd, and England's valiant sons âSustain'd defeat, by venturing to pierce thro' âThis leafy wilderness, where, clad in arms, âOur wily enemies, patiently lurk'd âUnseen, and unsuspected, till, at once, âLike eagle, from etherial eminence, âThey, on our force, pounced furious, and again âRetreated, to return at season meet, âAnd deal like ruin. âHenry II. who in our time actuated by youthful and indiscreet ardour, made a hostile irruption into Wales, and presuming to pass thro' that narrow and woody defile, experienced a signal defeat and a very heavy loss of men.ââGiraldus. âIn the meanewhile King Edward to restreine the rebellious attempts of those Welshmen, caused the Woods of Wales to be cut down, wherein before time the Welshmen were accustomed to hide themselves.â âHotinshed. âThe People of Salop were very useful to King Edward, in opening a large road thro' a long tract of Wood, which extended from England to Caernarvonshire.ââCarte's England. With thy axe-men true, âLevel these trees. Make straight and manifest, âThe road that leads to our disdainful foe.â Brave Mortimer no second word required, And now th' entangling trees, on either side, Beneath th' impetuous axe, fall headlong down. Edward, the while, thus to Earl Pembroke spake. âPembroke! Call forth thy men. Upon this spot, âErect the castle! Be it firm and strong, âAnd named Hawarden. Tho' of victory âUndoubting, yet, the uncertain chance of war âOft disappoints the bravest, and if Heaven âShould so decree, spite of our gallant arms, âThat we before Llewellyn should retire, âDiscomfited, to form new plans, and rouse âTo fiercer resolutions, this good spot, âWill be a welcome, tho' a last retreat.â The limits now are formed, spacious, and hosts, With willing heart, delve for the massy stone And clay adhesive. Whilst they thus pursue, Eager, their work, from the adjacent wood, Earl Mortimer advances. By his side, An aged woman walks, and toward the King, With all the speed of tottering five-score, Hastens along. Near her, a youth appears, And oft the silent tear rolls down his cheek. âLean harder,â he exclaims, âGrandam revered. âLet me perceive, the pressure of thy arm âIt will convey sweetfeelings to my heart, âMy aged mother!â Not a word she spake. Her mind, on other themes, dwelt earnestly, And tho' her lips she moved, steadfast to earth Her eyes were fix'd, heedless of all around. Whate'er she once had been, fancy might paint, And reason force, on the unwilling mind; Yet hard it was to think, that form thus old, So blighted and so bent, should once have stood In the exuberance of youthful prime, Even, like the pine, erect; that on her cheek, The damask rose abode; that her fair neck Charm'd the beholder; that her even teeth The snow excelled, and, her soul-piercing eyes Awed or inflamed, the hearts of village youths, Now long forgotten, 'neath the yew-tree shade! Yet such was she, so lovely, and so fair, Who now, with trembling step and haggard look, Brown, meagre, wither'd, slowly paced along. Poor lonely refuse of an age no more! The world, where still thou breathest, once was thine: Now it disowns thee! Thou hast lost thy power To taste life's sweets, and, like an Autumn leaf, From courtesy, still to the bare bough hang'st, Till the next blast shall whirl thee to thy tomb. Still onward, with the tortoise' speed she hastes. Like the tall bow, bent by the arm of strength, Her back appears. A silver lock before Hangs pendent, whilst her hat of broken straw Pointed arises, crouch'd on either side. Her face, of flesh bereft, wrinkled and dark, Chills the beholder, and requires a mind Full fraught, to know that human form it was And not some ghostly visitant. Her skin (All line and ligament, a garb of gauze,) Just hides the bone, even like a winter's cloak, Closely wrapt round. Her eye (that point, in man, Teeming with deity, and most allied To spirit, freed from matter gross and dull,) Scarcely appears, or from its socket dark Sends a strange beam, and manifest, like wolf Retired to his profoundest den of snows, When he decrys the prying hunter nigh. One hand hangs senseless in another's arm, The other holds a staff, both streak'd with veins, Deep blue and prominent, gliding along O'er rigid bones, 'till they might dive again, And be forgotten. So some mountain ash Or lofty pine, rising from barren rock, O'er which the grass scarce creeps, propels its roots As noon-day manifest, o'er the hard bed, 'Till having reach'd the friendlier soil, it dives Into earth's yielding substance, and pursues, There, its unseen and silent ministries. Now have they Edward reach'd, when Mortimer, With smiling visage, thus the King address'd. âSire! In yon wood, this mother of the dead, âNot without joy we found. As well thou know'st âAll superstitions, Cambria greedily âDrinks, with libations, copiously pour'd out âTo all the dread tormentors of mankind. âThy laughing faculties, O King, restrain!â âThe Cambrian's most illustrious oracle, âIs this old Beldame. From the farthest land, âCrowds follow her, and with expanded mouth, âBent heads and lifted eyes, list to her words, âAll pithy, and believe the gospel less, âThan her familiar converse with all things, âPersons and times, past, present, and to come. âShe thinks in numbers and she speaks in song. âBut tho' her words are stern as midnight frost, âOne key she has to her relentless mind! âSome call her âWitch,â but she, herself, denotes âThe âProphetess!â As we approach'd her cot, âLonely and dark, her votaries, like young hares, âFled rapid, and we found the aged form, âSitting, her cat beside, or else, alone. âAt my approach, no fear she testified; âAnd as I enter'd, firm of voice she cried, âVenturous Saxon! Tell me where Edward, his proud falchion rears! I have a song for him alone, Which shall shake his reins on his iron throne. Point thou the road To thy King's abode, Or I will call, with winged fears, A thousand lightning-barbed spears, One flash of which might thro' the air, Thy soul to the realms of Tophet bear.â âHer prophecies profound, full well I knew âOft roused our enemies' faint hearts, and urged âTheir lifted spears, to reach at mighty things. âAs thou wast near, this mystical old dame, âI thought thou might'st desire to commune with; âSo I resolved to lead her toward our Prince, âAnd there, a pleasant pastime, wondering learn âHer dread credentials. I must yet declare âAs from th' embower'd cot, we led her forth, âNot forcefully, this youth, from neighbouring tree, âBeheld her, and, affectionate, came down âTo sooth his aged mother. Tho' our spears âOn every side, stood thick, fearless of man, âHe toward her rush'd and cried, âTake this my arm! âBe comforted! Let not thy heart despair. âWhere'er thou goest, thither I will go, âTo scoff or shame, to prison or to bonds, âAnd if thou diest, I, beside thy grave, âBoth when the sun ascends and thro' the night, âPatient, will watch, till death, kind messenger, âShall call my head to lie as low as thine.â âShe answer'd not, but, tottering with her staff âFeebly along, hasten'd to meet thee here. âShe other fates hath told, but never yet, âDid listen to her own. Tell it, O King!â âMake this thy seat,â cried Edward. âAge like thine âLightly, shall pity scan. If well it seem, âMother, declare, in thy clear-sighted mind, âWhat scenes shall mark the future, and what doom âO'er England hangs. Yea, tell old Cambria's fate, âWhich thou hast long illumin'd with bright rays, âAnd prophecies, caught from supernal source.â The prophetess, slow from her seat uprose. Upon her stick rested one trembling hand, The other, with fore finger onward stretch'd, Waved gently in the air. At Edward's crest, Now silently she gazed, and whilst all minds Waited the spirit's motion, with a voice, Shrill, and from source uncertain, thus she cried. âEdward! Edward! Thou shalt know Erelong the weight of Cambria's ire; And in thy last and great o'erthrow, Whilst gallant men, inflict the blow, Crown'd with faded wreaths expire. Whilst mad furies dance, No longer advance, To the bleak hills, where freedom sits laughing at care, Haste! Haste! Or, too late, Thou shalt grapple with fate, And leave to thy country disgrace and despar! Edward! Edward! Back return, Swifter than the passing ray; A flaming cauldron now doth burn! And my eyes devour the funeral urn, Preparing for thy dying day. Soon Arthur shall haste. And, his country (laid waste) Redeem from the Saxons, who vanquish'd retire; Thou, Edward! Shalt fly At the glance of his eye, And his sword, beaming vengeance, consume thee like fire.â Edward replied. âMother! With air and tone âSo wild and awful, 'mid sage Cambria's sons, âI may not doubt thy high authority. âBut thou, on falsehood's base, dost build thy song. âArthur is dead! An opinion very generally prevailed in Cambria, (founded on a prophecy of Merlin) that Arthur was still living, and would yet appear to redeem his country. To correct this prejudice, Edward, subsequently, in the presence of several Cambrians, caused the tomb of Arthur, at Glastonbury Abbey, to be opened, where his remains were still visible. The exploits of Arthur, which have been handed down to us, by the old Historians, almost surpass the feats of the Scandinavian giants, Starchaterus, Harthin, Horldam, Arverod, &amp;c. as described by Olaus Magnus. The following is Joffery of Monmouth's account of Arthur's combat with a Spanish giant, who had stolen away Helen the niece of Duke Hoel. âNews was brought to Arthur that a Giant of monstrous size was come from the parts of Spain, and had forceably taken away Helena, the Niece of Duke Hoel, and fled with her to the top of Mount Michael (in Cornwall), and that the men who pursued after him were able to do nothing against him. For whether they attacked him by sea or land, he either overturned their ships with vast rocks, or killed them with several sorts of darts, besides, many of them he took and devoured half alive. The next night therefore Arthur taking two men with him, went out privately from the camp and hastened toward the mountain. As soon as they came near they saw a fire burning on the top of it, and another fire on a lesser mountain. Being in doubt on which of them the Giant dwelt, he sends one of his men to know the certainty. Finding a boat, Arthur now sails over to the lesser mountain. When he had begun to climb up to the top of it, he was at first frightened with a dismal howling cry of a woman from above, and imagined the monster to be there, when quickly rousing up his courage, he drew his sword, and having reached the top, found nothing but the fire which he had before seen at a distance. He discovered also a grave, newly made, and an old woman sitting and howling by it, who at the sight of him instantly cried out, âO unhappy man, what misfortune brings you to this place. I pity you! I pity you! The Monster will this night destroy the flower of your youth. The odious Giant who carried away the Duke's Niece, (whom I have just buried here) and me her Nurse, into this mountain, will soon be here and will immediately murder you. This most illustrious Princess, sinking under the fear her tender heart conceived, fainted away and expired. Fly, fly, the Giant will soon return, and instantly slay you.â The man directly returned to Arthur and gave him an account of all he had met with. Arthur lamented the damsel's sad fate, and determined to attack him immediately in single combat. For this purpose, he and his companions arriving at the mountain, they ascended to the top, Arthur leading the way. The horrible savage was then by the fire, with his face all besmeared with the clotted blood of swine, part of which he had already devoured, and was roasting the remainder before the fire. At the sight of them he hastened to his club, which two strong men could hardly lift from the ground. Upon this the king, ordering his companions to keep back, drew his sword and ran with all speed, to prevent him from getting it; but the Giant snatched it up and gave the King such a terrible blow on the shield, that he made the shores ring with the noise. Arthur at this being fired with rage, lifted up his sword and gave him a wound in his forehead which made the blood gush over his face and eyes. This made him exert himself with greater fury, and rushing on Arthur, he grasped him about the waist and forced him on his knees. Arthur nothing daunted slid out of his hands and now so bestirred himself with his sword, that he gave the Giant no respite till he stuck it up to the hilt in his skull. On this the monster gave a hideous roar and expired. Arthur cut off his head, and returning to his camp, all there received him as a champion who had freed his country from a most destructive and voracious monster. Duke Hoel, in grief for the loss of his Niece, commanded a mausoleum to be built over her body, in the mountain, where she was buried, which, taking the damsel's name, is called Helena's tomb to this day.â 'Neath Glastonbury's pile, âOnce he was laid, and ages now have waned, âSince he, with earth, hath blended his last dust, âThou may'st be wrong in this thy prophecy.â The youth, who near her stood, heard with amaze, Her words undaunted, and within his veins Felt terror creep, both for himself and her. And when he saw her for new words prepared, He touch'd her skinny arm and eager look'd Into her face, with silent earnestness, Bidding her think what dangers hover'd near. She, undismay'd, thus to the King replied. âArthur still doth being share, Tho' none his warrior form may see; Oft 'mid moonlight evening fair When the leaf hangs listless in the air, He whispers solemn truths to me. The moment hastes on The sun-beam hath shone Of the morning, which lights him to glory anew; The noon is at hand, When from Cambria's land To destruction, his sword shall proud Edward pursue. Other words, O Prince, attend! Truths unwelcome thou must hear, Before thy mortal course shall end, And earth-worms hail their royal friend, Crown'd, 'mid London, shall appear, Like a ghost from his grave, Llewellyn the brave, Whilst crowds, thronging round, shall exult at the sight. Fly! Fly! Or, too late, Thou shalt grapple with fate, And thy name and thy glory expire in night.â When Llewellyn commenced his contest with Edward, (consistently with the superstition of the age) he consulted an old woman, who was regarded as a Prophetess, respecting the consequences of the war. She encouraged him to persist, and assured him that in the result he would triumphantly ride through Cheapside in London, with a Crown on his head. She ceas'd; yet still her eye, from cavern dark, Pursued the theme, which fancy's teeming power Call'd into being, and as now she stood, Gazing in vacant air, Edward thus spake. âMother! Perchance, thy tongue, an oracle, âTruth may declare, yet one omission thine, âThou dost not say, if living, or if dead, âThro' London streets, Cambria's high Prince shall pass. âHaply a sable crown may deck his brow, âAnd his head grace a spear, as on it hies â'Mid shouting multitudes, to some tall point, âOn CÃ¦sar's tower.â Scornful, she answer'd thus. âEdward! Edward! Thunders loud, Now 'mid heaven indignant roll; Soon will they scare thy spirit proud, And laughing, I will weave thy shroud When lightnings have pierced thy soul. Llewellyn shall ride On prosperity's tide, When Edward hath closed his inglorious reign. He shall soon rule alone On his ancestor's throne Whilst the crown of the Saxon his brow shall sustain.â She ceas'd, when Edward, to Earl Mortimer, Thus smiling spake. âTho' I despise her words, âHer confident and high assuming air âMakes it an effort, most assured, to know âI do despise them. Thro' my rebel veins, âA faint chill hurries on, and my firm nerve âRelaxes, till her empire reason holds. âWell, Prophetess,â he cried, âsuch speech as thine, âSo harsh, and so uncouth to royal ears, âNot often have I chanced to light upon. âNo doubt thou know'st that all thy words are true, âNay essence of strict rectitude, more clear, âMore certain than if cold reality âAlready had impress'd the stamp of fate. âAnd must old England hide her head in dust, âAnd thus the Cambrian lord it over her! âThe Britons to their ancient seat return, âAnd Brutus' diadem, The Cambrians, under the most unpropitious circumstances, were encouraged by one of Merlin's prophecies, which predicted that a Prince of Cambria should conquer the whole Island, and again wield the sceptre of Brutus, the founder of their empire. batter'd and old, âGrace his descendant! Other forms arise. âPoor Edward! I behold him stiff and cold! âLlewellyn his fierce rival, with one foot âStamping upon his neck, whilst his right hand âWield's Albion's sceptre! Prophetess! while yet âEdward inhales th' inspiring breath of life, âHe will pronounce thy pardon, and perform âOne slender deed, which even thou shalt praise. âReceive this purse! Before thy aged limbs, âLie down in everlasting quietness, âSome comforts it may minister. This youth, âTill thy last breath arise, will succour yield. âDuty and love and reverence, in his heart, âForm a firm compact, and such constancy âMortals will honor and his God reward. âNow speed thee to thy home!â The youth look'd up, With grateful eye, but word he utter'd not; Whilst the old prophetess, with milder gaze, Complacent, view'd the king, then, turning, cried. âIn robe of gold and jasper drest, A cloud arises in the west! It hath an aspect, strange and newâ I will again my words review. Ah! There are characters profound, Which float on the sun-beam that hither is bound, I read them! They tell what I must not declare, Yet this will I say To arrest thy dismay The storm and the tempest, now brooding in air, Disarm'd of their force on thy head may descend, And thy Genius rejoice that this heart is thy friend.â She said and slowly from the King retired. âArms!â âArms!â Aloud is heard. âThe Foe is nigh!â The marshall'd ranks await, or here or there, Firm as their King, th' assault, or the pursuit. âA puny band,â cried Edward, âhovering round, âTo watch us, and descry what course we take; âToo sage to dare the vengeance of our spear.â The King to Warren spake. âWe must be wise, âNor hence hold conference, curious and vain. âWith Beldames or their Masters. We are here, â(A needful recollection e'en for us,) âUpon the hostile soil. Forgetting this, âIn some advancing moment less prepared, âExperience, wounding with the viper's fang, âMay force repentance. Ceaseless vigilance, âWar, rigorous, claims.â Warren assenting bow'd. Earl Mortimer now urged his labouring hosts To nobler efforts, and the forest trees, Before them fall, loud crashing, on all sides, Already have the strenuous multitude, Far thro' th' impervious wood, stretch'd their bold way. They move along, thro' their retreating foes, Like the stout mower at the break of morn. Edward, the while, sends many a gallant ship Laden with food and slaughter-instruments, Toward Conway's waters. Some, he bids attend, Faithful, his march, whilst speeding with hard toil, Round by the verge of Ocean, to subdue Rhudland, whose towers, long batter'd by the blast, Defiance frown'd, filling her foes with awe. BOOK XII. SCENE, Llewellyn's return from Gloster to the Palace of Aber. Now back to Snowdon, over hill and dale, Llewellyn sped, upon futurity Gazing with solemnized, yet dauntless brow. From Aber's walls, it was a goodly sight, When o'er the neighbouring mountain, with fair speed, The Cambrians saw their Prince. Each onward rush'd To greet the other. Lo, they meet, and shouts Teem thro' the air, whilst a tumultuous sight Marks their conjunction, friend embracing friend, And warrior warrior hailing, till they turn And in one body urge their friendly way. So 'mid the winter months, when two stout streams Swoln by dissolving snows, meet in one point, Awhile the conflict reigns, and loud the shock Of wave with wave commmingling, till, at length, The first rough greetings o'er, with even course And silently, both on together flow. 'Neath Aber's princely roof, the Cambrian chiefs, Llewellyn at their head, communing stand. The Prince inquires, âWhat of the English King? âHath he propounded honourable terms âAnd fair adjustment of our jealousies, âSince our departure? Ah! you answer not! âI know the sovereign passion of his soulâ âThe venom of his heart. He seeks alone âCambria's subjection. Pleasant is your smile! âAnd ominous of your approaching deeds.â Llewellyn told how Gloster's towers were rased, How Talbot fled his wrath. He sought to speak Of his loved Eleanor, but ere his tongue Utter'd her name, his faltering speech betray'd Internal conflict, and as thus he stood, Collecting his firm spirit, to the hall A Cambrian came, and to his Prince advanced. Thus he began. âLord of the Snowdon hills, âSad tidings mine! David, e'en Griffith's son, âThy Brother, with the English King hath join'd, âAnd sworn him fealty!â At the news, each heart Sank with dismay, and momentary fear Shot thro' their veins. Llewellyn loud exclaim'd, âCambrians! on you I rest! With your support âI have a host too valiant to deplore âThe loss of David. Let him bend his spear âAgainst his bleeding country! let him hurl, âOn her who nourish'd him, dark matricide! âThe murderous lance! the barb will back return âFrom the repellent rock, and his own heart âPierce with the scorpion's sting. Far other hopes, âO David! I, alas! had form'd of thee, âMy faithless brother! I had thought thy veins âFill'd with the Patriot's blood, and that thy heart âBeat valiantly, with the inspiring thoughts, âAnd bold resolves, which fill'd thine ancestors. âThy rose is wither'd! To the dust go down, âAnd perish with the base-born sons of earth.â While thus Llewellyn spake, with other news, One to the spot came posting and exclaim'd, âO Prince! thy brother David, at this hour, âMarches thro' Powis, calling on all men âTo join his standard, and support the cause âOf Edward, England's king. His treachery, âAlready hath obtain'd one meed, and now âHe stands, an English Knight! proud of the plume!â Llewellyn sigh'd and said. âThis is indeed âA bitter draught, yet, haply, it may serve âThe cause it meant to injure. Gallant men! âIt is a consolation to the brave, âWhen faithless and unsound and hollow hearts, âNo longer play the hypocrite, but throw, âNobly, the mask away, and stand erect, âIn their own proper character. The bane, âMostly we dread, when the slow poison lurks, âVeil'd from the eye, and the whole mass of blood âContaminates unseen: when it appears, âAnd reason calculates, cause and effect, âWe know the application, and disdain âThe attitude which puts us on our guard. âOur secret enemy now shews himself; âWe know him, and, whilst pity moves our heart, â(Pity for one, so fallen and so false) âDespise the traitor. Edwall! Hither haste!â Edwall, the young, the brave, the generous, Advances to his Prince. He dared not meet Llewellyn's anger-glance, but on the ground Fix'd his sad eye. Whilst all the pausing throng, Waited some new discovery, and half deem'd Edwall, a traitor. Thus Llewellyn spake. âTill now, I honor'd thee. I thought thy heart, âConstant, as to the sailing mariner, âHeaven's polar star. The object of my love âBears a cold aspect!â Edwall cried, âO Prince, âWithdraw not thy affection! Let no doubt âOf my integrity, my constancy, âDwell in thy spirit. Tho' my promises, âMy pledges, thus have fail'd, and my warm hopes âBeen blasted in the bud, doubt not my heart! âIt still is true, both to my native land, âAnd thee, Llewellyn.â Utterance fail'd, and now, Silent he stood, when thus the Prince replied. âEdwall! too many rising suns, these eyes âHave witness'd, to believe, all words alike âFounded in truth. Suspicion is a spirit âThat haunts the mean, yet when clear evidence âFlashes conviction, to resist the rays âThus teeming on all sides, denotes a mind, âWhere folly holds undue predominance. âDidst thou not pledge, all that to man is dear, âThat David's heart was faithfulness, his soul, âThe bright receptacle, where only dwelt âFeelings that honor man? Didst thou not say, âYea pledge thy name, thy character, thy all, âThat David would, erelong, his banner raise âAmid his fellows, and, the foremost stand, âTo hurl destruction on the English host? âSuspicion, in my mind, lurk'd, and I deem'd âDavid, no active friend, but to believe âHe could renounce, with as much ease, as men âThrow off their garment, love to Cambria's soil, âAnd prove the traitorâthis I had not dream'd. âYea, when I heard, Edwall's impetuous speech, âHis protestations, vows and solemn oaths, âThat David's heart was faithful; from my mind, âEach lurking doubt, like an ungenerous guest, âI bade depart, and call'd him brother still. âWhere is my confidence?â Edwall replied. âWith untold feelings of regret, I own âAll that thou sayst is true, yet, pardon me, âIf a fond doubt still linger in my breast. âDavid, I fear, unwittingly, is wrong'd. âThere may be some mistake, some unperceived âAnd latent circumstance, which, understood, âMight justly sooth the fierceness of thy wrath, âAnd ardent indignation. Is it truth? âNaked and undisguised? this to admit, âArduous, I find. Wait till new evidence âForces conviction. To believe, my friend, âDavid, the associate of my youthful days, âAnd up to manhood prized unceasingly, âAs one, in whom each generous purpose dwelt, âFor the aspiring spirit to survey, âModel and bright example; to believe âThis gorgeous dawn the prelude to black storms, âThat the fair sun, rising in all his pride, âSo soon should dip into a sable cloudâ âIt is impossible! On hope's bright side, âI linger, like a mother for her child, âBorne from the fontal wave. David, I know, âE'en as myself! He is a true-man still! âYet, do I pledge, my character, my life, âOn his affection to his native land! âHear me, Llewellyn! Let me seek him out! âIf foe he be, I to his sword will trust, âAnd throw myself into the arms of death. âSpeak, O my Prince! and instant I will haste, âFearless to meet him. Yea, I do affirm, âIf traitor, which I know him not to be, âOne look alone, shall break whatever spell âEncircle him; and I will drag him out âFrom treason's pit, e'en tho' its depths extend âDown to earth's centre.â Thus the Prince replied. âEdwall, depart! Find the unhappy man! âWarn him that death is near and that disgrace âAnd infamy will hunt him to his grave. âAn English Knight! Let not th' historic page âName the disgrace, O Cambria! of thy son. âAway! New thoughts are mine! I must prepare âFor conflict and for fame!â Bending to earth, Edwall retired, when, as he reach'd the door, A warrior enter'd, breathless and exclaim'd. âEdward hath pass'd the Dee! On this our soil âHis foot now rests! His breath pollutes our air! âAnd his fierce armies, bent on blood and spoil, âPress onward, to contend with Cambria's Lord.â Llewellyn cried, âEnough! The holy manâ âThe venerable Bishop, in his suit, âYea, in the suit of truth and equity, âBy this, hath fail'd. His kind and earnest speech, âHath beat'n against a rock of adamantâ âE'en Edward's heart. Subjects our hope is quench'd. âEach door is shut, at which humanity âAn entrance sought, and we are left alone âTo combat for our lives and liberties. âSmiling, we meet the conflict. Rhudland's towers âStand like a host of giants and will bar âEdward's approach, hurling defiance round, âTill we draw near, and man to man engage; âSuch strife as Arthur might himself survey! âCambrians, rejoice! The conflict may be hard, âBut victory at last will be our crown.â Llewellyn shouted âGriffyd!â Thus he spake. âSpeed thou to Powis! Should our brother false, âThe traitor David, tempt our gallant sons, âAnd shake their loyalty. Tell them, alone, âCambria, their Mother calls! she gasps for breath! âBrave Meyrion, hither haste. Do thou depart, âInstant to Dinevawr. Arouse all breasts. âIn whom their country's love may yet abide, âAnd warn them, as they prize their native hills, âTheir hearths, their liberties, and me their Prince, âTo haste to Gwyned. We will forth depart âTo try our swords, and teach one lesson more âTo Edward, England's King, our mortal foe!â Llewellyn, now, order'd due food and arms, For Dolbadarn, on Snowdon's lofty brow, For Conway, Dyserth, Rhudland, castles brave, Form'd for tempestuous strife; the while he march'd Leading his army, Cambria's choicest sons, To meet the bold Invader of his land. BOOK XIII. SCENE, Edward's approach to the Castle of Rhudland. Now Edward, and his host of warriors brave, Press'd on toward Rhudland. They who erst had fought On Syria's shore, and borne the buffetings Of distant warfare, cheerily march'd on: As when some village, populous, pours forth Its laughing habitants, to swell the wake, With tricks and pastimes, forth they march'd along, Disdainful of their enemies, and talk'd Of feathery conquests, and the easier task That now awaited valour, when the foe Shrank back appall'd, nor dared the threat'ning front, England display'd, smiling in conscious strength. No foe molests them. Onward still they march With growing confidence. Each hamlet small, And hospitable mansion, where the harp Late, call'd to merriment, or joys sedate, Smiling Old Age, and Blooming Innocence, Now desolate appears, cheerless and still. The frighted inmates, in wild uproar rude, Peasant and lord, fled on precipitate, To the far mountains, peering 'bove Heaven's clouds. Each bore his jewel. Some the ponderous gold, Trinket, or garment; some the lisping child, Laughing aloud, at tumult and alarms; Too green for knowledge.âSome the tottering friend Led on; whilst, here and there, with arduous toil And silently, some sons, affection taught, Bore on their shoulders, from the Saxon sword, Their aged parents, call'd at evening hour, Just as they reach'd the grave, to feel the force Of searching apprehension;âstill the same, Tho' their support, a son, and by their side, Each moment, uttering kind solicitudes, The daughter, weeping, with extended hand, Watching the slightest motion, that might seem To claim support. Onward, in haste, they go Desponding, heartless, gazing at the skies,â (To which the stoutest heart, in danger turns, Like summer's blushing fruit, to the bright sun.) The lowing cattle sounded on all sides, As from their pastures and fair orchard plats, The Master, kind, urged them, with bitter stripes, And forced them forward, over hill and dale, To lonely cave, afar, or spring-head, (veiled By rush majestic) or to th' impervious glen, Or the recesses of the forest deep. As Edward and his host, in th' Cambrian lands Advanced triumphant, to the English heart, There came a secret pang. War they had scorn'd, With all its mountain-like impediments, But here no strife was found. All was given up With unsought quietness, whilst he who took The land before them, all which it contained, Doubts and misgivings felt, searching tho' brief. It was too passive. Obstacles to meet, And to surmount, might give a doubtful right To spoils, hard-gotten, mix'd with self-applause For prowess, to the venturous test, put forth; But here it seem'd ungenerous to stretch out The hand to seize, resistance far away. While marching thus, 'mid the revolving thought, Still, to disturb the burden of their joy, No sound was heard, from busy man, no voice, Save the wood choristers, (to whom, alike, All masters reign.) No cheering sight appeared Of smoke, slow rising, 'mid the valley's trees, Speaking of comfort, all was void and still; Whilst, 'mid the spacious campaigns and the hills, Lofty and wild, no living thing appear'd, Save some old beast, worn to his last day's toil, Limping and meagre, that scarce moved away, When banners, and the burnish'd mail advanced. Now, long, had Edward left the shores of Dee, And, by the boundless ocean, urged his course, Scorning impediment. At length arose, To his delighted sight, Rhudland's tall towers! Upon that morn, no lagging tent had caught The sun's first beam. Before he raised his head, Amid his clouds effulgent, spreading far Radiance, unearthly, Edward and his host Had gather'd up the warrior's canopy And urged their course, as racers strenuous. The sun upon the western verge appeared, When Rhudland, (thus the haven of their toil) Cheer'd them, as the first blossom of the war. Roused to fresh ardour, on they force their way, And now before the Cambrian castle stand. In Rhudland's towers, a gallant chief abode, The veteran Mervyn. In his country's cause, His blood had flow'd, and many a death-fraught dart His nervous bow had sent, with force and speed, So potent and surpassing, that his foes, Still trembling, call'd each dart, with fury urged, The dart of Mervyn. Death before him stalk'd, And dreadful was the vengeance of his spear. Himself a rampart to the invading foe, Llewellyn placed him, with full confidence, In Rhudland, there to hold at bay, what power Trespass'd on Cambria's soil. Full well he knew Edward's bold march. Tho' slender was his force, His heart was true, and, like himself, each man Circling his chief, panted to rear his name High on Fame's shaft; and now that they beheld Few match'd with many, greater was their joy, For fairer was the occasion to perform The glorious enterprise. With heart elate, From the proud spire, Mervyn beheld the foeâ His long array, and aspect terrible, His burnish'd mail and spear and flaming shield, And cheer'd himself with hope of some bold deed On which to build a name, Great 'mid the Great. The firm resolve is made. Descending swift, Thus to his chiefs he spake. âSons of brave Sires. âThis is my resolution. Whilst the foe âPrepares for combat, e'en while yet the moon âLingers in Heaven, we, from our gate, will teem, âAnd heap discomfiture and shame and death, âOn our invaders.â Every eye around, At these his words, with exultation gleam'd. Each seized his sword and girt his thigh for war, Waiting the signal, for the rush of arms. Edward, when near to Rhudland's towers arrived, Sent faithful men, up to an eminence, Cowering, at hand, bidding them mark and tell Whate'er in Rhudland caught their curious eye. One now return'd, breathless, and spake aloud, The enemy hastes forth! At th' gate they stand, Their swords unsheath'd, and waiting to outpour Their veterans on our unsuspecting arms. Edward exclaimed. âPembroke, attend thy Prince. âThe Cambrians, from yon gate, prepare to pass, âUpon our ranks, sudden dismay, to pour. âBefore yon gateway, with thy valiant bands, âStand resolute, and when they hasten forth, âLed on by Mervyn, flee! Entice them on! âI, with my faithful troops, deep in yon dell âWill watch the moment. As they follow bold, âFull confident of victory, at hand, âI will appear, seize their half-guarded gate; âAnd when thou turn'st, between our walls of steel, âUnless they instant yield, unqualified, âWe will thro' death, pass on to victory.â He spake, nor word in idleness ensued. And now the King, with Pembroke's noble Earl, Each at his post, waits the outpouring spear. O Death! Whilst mortals talk of deeds renown'd, And feast excursive fancy, pressing on, In the career of fame, and planning well Their future lives, (lengthen'd to tottering age,) In scenes of proudest eminence, conjoin'd With honor, pleasure and remembrance fair; How often dost thou hover at their heels, Laugh at the ripen'd purpose, confident, With which they treat the future, and the while With brow unbending, delve the rayless pit; When, as thy victims stretch their eager hand To pluck the bud of joy, thy blast of fate Sends them to the long sabbath of the tomb. Mervyn! Thy hour is come. Talk of thy feats, And glory in thy consummated hopes, Leagued with renown, lifting thy name to heaven, Few times thy heart shall palpitate, thine eye Few times shall gaze around on this fair orb, Throng'd with transcendent forms of loveliness, Ere, on thy parent earth, thy head shall lie, And everlasting darkness spread her pall Over thy countenance! âNow is the time!â Mervyn exclaim'd to his impatient bands, Intent and panting to begin the fray. âThis gate expanded, forth I lead you on, âTo stamp, on the eternal rock of time âYour deathless valour. Weary with their march, âNor doubting, nor prepared to meet our blow, âWe will assault the flower of Palestine, âThis Edward, veteran in the war of slaves, âWhen cowards lead the strife. Now shall he learn âHow freemen fight, roused in their country's cause. âPress forward! Play the man! Throughout their ranks âScatter confusion. Leave no rallying pause, âBut, like the chaff before the hurrying storm, âDrive them to shame and death. Whoe'er shall slay âEdward, proud potentate, and rash as fierce, âShall tower to princely eminence. His crest, âShall shine a meteor in the arch of fame. âBravery disdains all perils and all bars! âSpread wide the gate! We rush to victory.â The Cambrians issue forth, pouring like bees, In the rich plenitude of summer skies, When on some neighbouring hive they rush to war. Pembroke beheld them. Wily he retires. âSpeed, sons of valour!â Mervyn cried aloud. âRush like the stormy wave, whelm them in death.â Edward survey'd the flight and the pursuit, When from his secret covert hastening forth, He seized th' half-guarded gate. The signal shout Earl Pembroke heard, and, with a lion's rage, When, fierce, he turns on the presumptuous foe, Wheeling, impell'd the death-dart thro' the air. Edward, behind, advances. Mervyn saw His blasted hopes, and, ere the fight began, Exclaim'd with vehemence, âCambrians, new foes, âAnd unexpected, hover in our rear. âHigher the mark for courage. Like yourselves, âDauntless face danger, and a lesson stern, âOf memorable import, teach this day âThe Saxon ravager.â A shout is heard, And forth they join in fight, sword clashing sword, And dissonant sounding shields, filling wide Heaven. As Autumn, in her many-coloured garb, Feels the rough breeze, rustling amid her boughs, And instant on the turf, strews her seer leaves, On every side, whirling, in slant descent; So, at this clash of arms, hosts of the brave Lie prostrate round, ordain'd no more to feel Humanity's inspiring and warm hope, Or chilling terrorâboth for ever fled! Brave Mervyn, like the oar, passing o'er waves Of aspect dread, forced his impetuous course Thro' ranks of heroes, till before the King Dauntless he stands, and aims the deathful blow. Edward beheld the thunderbolt, and knew Its ordination, that the earth alone Would stay its fury. High he raised his sword, Shouting, âAway! Edward with Mervyn strives.â Skill and resistless strength, both now display.â The strife is over! Yielding his last breath, Low lies the Cambrian! One impetuous blow Laid bare his brain! Prostrate, he gasps and dies! âMercy!â On all sides sounds. The Cambrians flee Impetuous as the torrent, whilst aloud Edward exclaims, âRespect the conquer'd foe! âVictory is ours and generous be our deed.â The strife is o'er. The vanquished trembling stand, The wounded are upheld, and now the dead (E'en whilst the moon shines cloudless in the sky) Are mantled with the sod. The hour is come, When wrathful foes with foes, peaceful, recline Beside each other on one common bed.â And here, at length, will all the elements, The heart-corroding passions, jars and strifes, That move the soul in this sublunar state, Quietly rest, unnoticed, and as still As the torn bough, rent by the hurricane, Which falls 'mid forests never pierced by man. The moon had now retired and morn, in th' east, Expanded her grey pinion, tipp'd with gold; Whilst, in still reverence, creation paus'd, Waiting the flame of glory, kindling fast, With an exuberance of gorgeous clouds. It bursts! The firmament o'erflows with fire, And emanations of celestial light!â Who shall survey this stately orb, nor think, With an abased soul, of that Great Power, Who spake, and all things started into life!â Who dwells in his peculiar residence, Tho' he is near to all, beyond the sky, Out far, 'mid dim and unimagin'd space!â Who form'd this sphere terraqueous, and endued With a prolific and efficient power The varied elements!âWho stamps his name On every plant and creeping thing obscure, Fish, bird, and beast, but chiefly shines in man, In th' humble heartâNoviciate for the skies! Fair is this world and lovely, yet none view, (Save those who have been taught gladly to hear The songs of Sion) in yon stately orb, The hand of Deity. Less favour'd men, (Even multitudes bearing the human form, Gifted with eyes to see, with hearts to feel, Most abject sight! Most miserable state!) Wander 'mid shades profound. Heaven's air they breathe; Heaven's sun they view; Heaven's bounty they partake, Insensible!âAround their every path, Nature, with full perfection of her powers, Teems with all prodigal luxuriance; Yet in their breasts, no incense and pure thoughts, Grateful, arise. Their lands with wine o'erflow, And fruits and flowers and each soul-cheering thing, Yet there the praise of God is never heardâ Thro' days and months and years, from age to age, Throwing fresh bloom and beauty o'er the scene!â All there is sterile, barrenness, and dearth Of holy things, whilst hell's pernicious lies, And heathenish rites, sanguine and horrible! On every side, like a vast desert spread.â Thy kingdom come, Maker of heaven and earth!â O Charity! E'en thou, from Salem's tower Gazing on lands, rescued from Satan's bonds, And where the truth shines cloudless, loud dost cry. He who surveys this world (with wonders fraught And mercies infinite) but chiefly thee, O glorious sun! emerging in thy pride Immaculate, nor lifts his soul to God, Nor worships him, dread Sovereign, and all wise, And good as greatâthe Father of our Spirits! Degrades his nobler nature to the brute. He stands on earth, a stony monument Of the perverted mind, groping at noon, Disfranchised of the heart and intellect Which claims a kindred with the stars of heaven. Awake, thou morn! Follow'd no more by eve, When 'mid such scenes as these, cheering the heart, (But, far estranged from heaven and light divine,) Haste on, O morn! When mid these fragrant bowers, And balmy winds, and skies of paradise, The man who loves his God, and worships him, In such his fairest works, rapturous shall stray And solace and imbrue his ardent mind, With meditations lofty, from all round Rising spontaneous. What were gems and gold, Heaped to the skies, O Truth! Compared to thee! What were her worth, the richest ship that ere Sailed proudly on, with her oppressive freight, From Acapulco, or Golconda's shore, Compared with her's, which o'er the Thracian tide Toward Europe, lost, abandon'd, sunk in night, First cross'd with tidings of a better world? Hence now the light shall spread. Our Pharos Tower In the appointed time (blessings on them Who hasten it in their day!) It would have been incongruous to refer in a more direct way to the Missionaries, in the text, but I cannot repress the impulse I feel, to express in a Note the further sentiments of respect which I entertain for these most excellent and elevated of Human Characters. The length of the poem would have excluded it, in this place, if the subject had been less appropriate and important. ADDRESS TO THE MISSIONARIES. Whilst some the Song to Chiefs and Patriots raise, With nobler zeal, I loftier spirits praise; Men who, to please their Maker and proclaim To Nations sunk in night, a Saviour's name, Have left the land where Pleasure sits and smiles, Joyous have left, e'en Britain, Queen of Isles;â Friends, home, contentment, all that life endears, Freely renounced, for anguish, toil, and tears, Endured the scorching waste, the raging flood, While fearless on the Rock of Faith they stood. Must each be launch'd erelong on Death's cold stream! Each pass awayâlike a forgotten dream!â O, higher thought and fearful, doth there wait For all the Sons of Men, an endless state! Is there an hour, momentous, drawing near, When, all who live, shall their last sentence hearâ Yield up their stewardship, meet their Judge, and go To joy supreme or unimagined woe! You have believed, and for the Deluge wide Prepared your Ark, that safe the storm shall ride. You know there is. While others, till they die, Deem all things serious but Eternity; You, better taught, a future Empire raise And spend for God your few and fleeting days. Like your Great Master you your ease disdain, And combat with the Scoffer, want, and pain. Like him you view, beyond these realms of care, Th' unfading crown which waits the Righteous there. You have been taught th' inestimable worth Of that great Treasure, Heaven bestow'd on Earth; That precious Gift, that Book of Life and Light Which sheds refulgence o'er a world of Night: Of such a Pearl, who can the worth disguise And brood with sordid pleasure o'er his prize? Truth, noble, generous, longing to impart, Conveys a genial influence to the heart: Its elementâis to dispense all good; It feels for distant Nations, Brotherhood; Embraces, with one ardent grasp of soul, Men of all climes, from Ganges to the Pole. Religion, true, with an Ithuriel touch, May find the Miser, but ne'er left him such. O Men! whose treasure lies in yonder sphere, Who do not live, but only sojourn here; Who dedicate to God, your time, your heart, Willing to live, or ready to depart; Whilst abject minds, for paths ignoble born, Thunder their threats, or cast the taunt of scorn, You hear their fierce upbraidings, and repay With prayers for them, who know not what they say. Thro' good and ill report, to conscience true, You like the sun, unmoved your course pursue. Christ is your hope, whose smile all wounds can heal; And whilst of Heaven the foretaste sweet you feel, You long to teach what Prophets taught before, And sound the Gospel to Earth's farthest shore. Oh! had the Vision call'd, in that deep dream, Paul, eastward to have borne his sacred theme; With Heaven's rich gifts, to feed the Tartar wild, And not the Macedonian, Europe's Child: Had no kind Spirit, casting fears behind, Bless'd with a pulse that beat for all mankind, (Whose heart the Light contain'd) once thoughtful stood, Framing luxurious schemes for human good, Beheld where Albion's snow-white clifts appear'd, And boldly to the barbarous Briton steer'd, How had our Savage Faith its strength maintain'd, And what even here the Night that now had reign'd! Climes, once for Arts and Science fair renown'd, As time roll'd on, have plunged in shades profound; Whilst Lands, to ten-fold darkness long resign'd, Have burst their bonds, and led the Sons of Mind. Haply, O Heaven avert the curse severe! Once more the Pagan Rite may triumph here; And regions, now, where men to Idols bend, The Altar reverence and the Ark defend! What might so soon God's sleeping wrath awake, And o'er our Isle, tempt him his scourge to shake, His lamp remove, his heritage forsake, As languor, to extend the Gospel Sound, The Bread of Life, to starving Nations round!â As that disastrous, mournful spirit, chill, Which scorns to work and frustrates those who will! Soft as the far-off murmuring of the sea, Sweet as at morn the Birds' clear melody, (Amid the shout of Orgies Vile) I hear The still small voice of Penitence and Prayer! Sunk as they were in guilt, abased, depraved, Ten Righteous Men had once a People saved, Hope yet is ours! Tho' crowds on every side, Their Maker's Laws disdain, his Threats deride, England may boast, even yet, her righteous few, Salt of our land! and not the least in you. How shall the future sons of sires, who now, In climes remote, to stocks and statues bowâ (O fearful depth of folly and of crime! Man, even Man! endued with powers sublime, Disclaims his rank, to basest things that be Lifts the adoring eye, and bends the knee!) How shall such, brought to their maturer sense, Read with delight the page of Providence! How shall such, rescued from their thraldom vile, Pour thanks to Heaven, then, with an angel-smile, Gaze back ward far upon the men revered, Who first their land with Songs of Sion cheer'd, Brought them the Truth, the Book of Knowledge spread, And pour'd its thousand blessings on their head! What gratulations, what transcendent praise Their hearts to you shall breathe, their voices raise, As, basking in the light, a glance they cast, O'er the dark vale, the dreary desert past! As, on their race of storms, their night of woe, Safe, from the mount of God, they look below! When waning age on age hath roll'd away, Since you with earth have mix'd your honer'd clay, While hosts, oblivion down to darkness bear, Still shall your memory flourish fresh and fair; Of you, the lisping Child shall learn to speak, Whilst the warm tear steals down the Mother's cheek: Yet nobler thoughts than these your heart beguile;â Conscience' sweet voice and Heaven's approving smile, Ye Great of Earth, arise! At once appear CÃ¦sars and Pompeys, men unknown to fear; Whose warlike feats the porphyry column bears; Who view'd the World, and proudly call'd it theirs; Who lived to tread the steep, to build the name, Whilst slaughter'd thousands mark'd their road to fame. What grateful heart, slow, from the dying bed, Ere call'd on Heaven for blessings on their head! Crowds, rather, in their pangs, with death in sight, Curs'd on the hour which gave them to the light. These are not Great! Illustrious men and wise, You are the Great, whose deeds to Glory rise! You distant realms have sought, with untold pains, Not to explore fresh marts, or count new gains, Like some Dark Fiend, with venom in your eye, To swell the tide of human misery, But, with benignant smile, your joys to share, To free the Captive, smooth the brow of care, Throw back the veil, the Star of Hope display, And guide benighted souls to endless day. Such Brainerd was, who braved th' inclement sky, To teach the friendless Indian how to die. Such Swartz was found, who, 'mid the Heathen, long, Unfainting, toil'd, and lived to hear the song From the Wide Banian, in loud concert rise, Harmonious, to the Father of the Skies. Such Vanderkemp, such Carey, Marshman, are, With those who sow, 'mid southern Isles afar, Or round steep Caucasus, or on the shore Of ice-bound Greenland, or rude Labrador, Or in Columbian Isles, where men, with skins Black as their Master's hearts, less black their sins, Rejoice, with tears, and toils, and groans opprest, To hear from you, of Heaven that world of Rest. You are the Great of Earth! While hearts of steel Behold the wound, and feel no wish to heal, You view remote, nor heed-the threatning wave, Millions expiring lie, and rush to save. If, sometimes, whilst thro' distant lands you roam, You cast a lingering look toward Friends and Home, Think oftener, on the sure, the blissful state, The Palms, the Crowns which for the Pilgrim wait. Should pain assault you, still in God believe; Should sorrow reach, O think for whom you grieve: Should want, in lonely climes, your steps pursue, Dwell on that Name who suffered more for you. He has declared, whate'er his Servants bear, For him, their Master, in this world of care, Blessings shall still exceed their tears and sighs, Whilst, in reversion, joy unfading lies. Guiding the Gospel Plough, gird up your mind! Heed not the chaff which you have left behind! Look forward, courage take, behold the end! What can you deign to mourn, with God your Friend? You seek not earth's reward, nor man's applause, You all are Champions in your Maker's Cause; And round your arduous path, tho' sad, the while Crowds of admiring Angels watch and smile. The hour must come, haply it draweth nigh, The fast unfolding Dawn of Prophecy, When Love Divine shall every heart inflame, And every tongue confess Immanuel's name; Warm'd with such prospects, in the darkest day, Be Heaven's eternal word your staff and stay; With zeal, around, your glorious mission spread, And make your Father's Will, your daily bread. May He, in every hour of need provide, In sickness cheer you, and thro' dangers guide; Make smooth and plain your path, where'er you go, Bid you, like him, the Gospel Trumpet blow, Who with the Goal in sight, a Heaven, a Home, All things could bear, Stripes, Bonds and Martyrdom. Not o'er a sea, unruffled, calm and clear, Must you your venturous Bark expect to steer: The sun sometimes may smile, the zephyr blow, And soft and sweet the tide of feeling flow; When, like the alternate changes of the deep, Tempests and storms, the louring skies may sweep; Expect, nor be deceived. Alike prepare Hardships or ease to meet, the Soldier's fare. If Friends protect, on God the praise bestow; If Foes assail, with meekness bear the blow; Nor hope to root out errors strong and deep, Save like the men who plough before they reap. Hell, roused from slumber, in his dread array, Erelong, in rage, may rise to meet the fray; Call up Foul Spirits, to himself allied, And yield, with mortal throe, his empire wide; But he who leads you forth, for your defence, Will screen you with his own Omnipotence. Be not, at aught, too joyous or too pain'd, Fear must be check'd and Hope herself restrain'd. Our sight is but a point, our lifeâa day! Grief soon subsides, and pleasuresâwhere are they! Tho' with our own dear schemes our bosoms swell, What might be best at last, we cannot tell. The cloud that looks so fair, may waft distress, The tear, the pang, the cross, be sent to bless. That Sovereign Power, to whose pervading eye, All times, the past, the future, naked lie; Whether he walk conspicuous, clothed in light, Or all his footsteps mists involve and night, Even Him, adoring still, our hearts should own, And say, âThy will be done, and thine alone.â As on you go, proclaiming as you can Salvation for the rebel race of man; Freedom that breaks the fetters of the mind, Ears to the deaf, and vision to the blind, Should hosts, dissolved in tears, your tidings hail, Should Satan's kingdom fall and Truth prevail, Thousands on thousands round your footsteps throng, Confess his name to whom all hearts belong. Yet should but here and there a blade be found, Whilst weeds, in rank luxuriance, wave around; Should they be foes to you, who were before Foes to the God, whom you unseen adore, Let not Egyptian night your souls dismay, Faint is the opening dawn that leads to day: But should no fruit your longing spirits cheer, O'er the wide scene should naught but tares appear, Let Faith, unwavering, still support your feet, Nor faint, tho' torrents roar and tempests beat. What tho' no garlands crown your mortal race, Nor fruits, nor flowers, around your path you trace, Seed sown by you, long 'neath the ground may lie, Water'd of God, unmarked by mortal eye, Ordain'd, in the appointed hour, to rise, And with majestic verdure fill the skies. Soul reverenced men! Receive th' applauding strain, Which kings and conquerors might desire in vain. To you, a distant brother leads the song, Which thousands join, in chorus loud and long. 'Mid lands, that never heard Jehevah's praise, Aspire the Standard of the Cross to raise, Earth's mourning sons, with your glad tidings cheer, Go! and a Temple to your Maker rear! Whilst there are lands, and tribes which countless be, Who never joy'd to hear our jubilee, Who never knew the christian's rich repast, Pardon and peace, and hope of Heaven at last, But to pernicious lies and rites resign'd, With death and darkness league their prostrate mind, Be you with zeal inflamed, in strength array'd, Strive in the glorious conflict undismay'd, And with the arm of God to lead the way, Lift the loud trump, the torch of truth display. Shall petty sights alone attract our eye, The rise and fall of mortal majestyâ Kingdoms and men, who in perpetual round Blaze and expire? Shall these our prospects bound, And not your causeâthe Glory of our age, (Grandest of all which human minds engage!) Awake our highest interest, hopes and fears, The heart that vibrates, and the voice that cheers? They who, beyond the present, view, combin'd, The mighty Future, trampling time behind, Feel, with spontaneous glow, in every vein, Ardour to burst the Heathen's mental chainâ To waft to them our pearl of matchless price, And wider spread the gates of Paradise. May you who wage the warfare with the foe; May you who freely of your wealth bestow; May you whose hearts implore, and ever will, His blessing which must give the increase still, Strive in your different ways, more earnest be, Not fainting, you secure the victory. Once more, amid the sickening scenes that rise, Good men and great, to you I turn my eyes. The star of Bethlehem, from night profound, Emerges fair, with sun-like splendour crown'd. Vision on vision, kindling, I survey, Till with o'erpowering beam it dies away. And can it be, that who the brunt sustain Should call aloud for aid, yet call in vain? Alone, 'neath sultry suns the toil you bear, The field is wide but labourers few are there. In such a conflict, and with such a prize To rouze their zeal, may kindred spirits rise, Sent, and endued with unction from above, Wise as the serpent, harmless as the dove, Proud to support your hands, like you to deal The Words of Life Eternal, which reveal Where our best treasure lies, our hopes refine, And point our ardent gaze to Things Divine. While thus of faith and righteousness you preach, And your whole walk confirms the truths you teach, Fearless, the path pursue (tho' men revile) On which th' Almighty smiles and still will smile, Till all the Powers of Darkness vanquish'd fly, And Earth one Altar rears, to Him who form'd the Sky. shall send its beams Unsullied, to each pole; and when the lands, Deserted now, at length, shall lift their voice, In the exuberance of gratitude, And pour the anthem; at the new-heard sound, When thus the song divine, warbling ascends; Amid such scenes, when first the symphony, Praise to the Highest!â bursts from th' glowing heart, Th' angelic choir, exulting at the sound, Shall shake with joy heaven's everlasting throne, As thro' the mansions of the just, prevail Their âHallelujahs!â At the inspiring strain, Sent in soft cadence to the world below, The realms, from darkness rescued, shall augment The glorious concertâforests, rocks, and hills All hail the march of Truth, whilst founts and streams Sweeter shall murmur, and the breeze combine, At th' voice of Nature's harmonies uprous'd, His choicest notes, with the glad Jubilants. And what if now, after age-lengthen'd frosts, Winters untold, what if the glorious Seed, From its dark covert, yet unbless'd of day, Should now be bursting, even that Tree of Life Whose healing leaf, at length, shall reach the bounds Of this terrene, and bless and fertilize All 'neath its shade; what if the glorious workâ The cause of God, the Happiness of Manâ Should be begun, even now, 'mid climes remote, 'Mid Regions vast as an inferior Sphere, And Satan's Empire tremble! Visions vast, Ineffable! before the eye-ball play. Erelong, (like stars, emerging from black clouds, Not to return,) and Earth's regenerate Sons, 'Mid Idol hills and shades, shall talk of God, And own his providence, and bless his name, Whilst in their minds, with trembling awe, shall rise Great thoughts (inspired by the pure Fount of Light, The Book of Life, inestimable Pearl!) Of what will follow this brief span of time;â Such scenes, as make Humility, even feel, Gazing toward Heaven, vast in the scale of things. The thought will riseâthat he, who clothes the field; Who gives the stream its course; who bids the woods Wave melody; uprears th' imperial crag; With fragrance fills the air; and spreads the sky, Azure by day, by night, in silence throng'd With the unutterable pomp of fire, Will not forget to clothe with permanence Of untold blessedness, the good, the pure, The cleans'd and sanctified, them for whose sake A Saviour left, in pity to lost man, The mansions of his Father and his God. Edward now call'd his chieftains and thus spake. âConquest's first opening bud, Subjects, is ours! âBravest of men, high and exalted praise, âI offer not. This semblance of a fight, âTender'd no scope for valour such as yours. âOur few, tho' desperate foes, fought with stout hearts, âAnd Mervyn hath my pity. Gallant man! âA better fate he merited, but War. âWith indiscriminate and ravenous jaw, âFeeds on the base and brave. New thoughts are ours. âHear me, O Warriors! Soon with equal force, âLlewellyn, our great foe, with marshall'd rank, âAnd glittering spear, and falchion beaming bright, âWill challenge your renown. Then is our day. âThen will the living pediment arise, âWhile Honor shall descend and crown each brow âWith wreaths immortal.â At the Monarch's words, Fill'd with stupendous prospects, indistinct, Of good to come, each man upon the ground Stamp'd his firm spear, and look'd with steady eye, Forward, into the vault obscure of Heaven. With some such feeling of undefined and intangible greatness, as is excited in the mind, by the Dedications, in many old books, to the Noblemen and Bishops of former days, in which the most superlative talents are ascribed to them, with a profusion of apostolical virtues which were to call forth the idolatry of all succeeding ages. In our endeavours however to form a more intimate acquaintance with these earthly luminaries, we often find that the wings of their fame have been unfortunately âclipped,â and that their only remaining record, and our only remaining guide, is âRobert, Lord Arch Bishop of York,â or âWilliam, Lord Bishop of Lincoln,â or âRichard, Earl of Carbery.â (This Lord Richard, indeed was the friend and patron of Jeremy Taylor; reputation enough for any moderate man.) The Bishops, of late, have generally prefixed their own proper names to their publications, and, when addressed, have required the same of others, which gives all the discrimination, of which human notice is susceptible, but, in general âMy Lord,â or âHis Grace,â who is complimented with these high notices, is ordained to irremediable obscurity, from the difficulty of attaching distinct ideas of personality, where the title, or in the language of Botany, where the genus and not the individual is made the distinguishing mark. To the credit of the present age, these lying and fulsome dedications are less common than they were. Over some men we mourn thatâin their intellectual opulence, rather than be independent on a pittance (sometimes not a pittance) so preserving the health of their mind, that blessing above praise, that they should stoop to flatter and bow down with obeysance to those (titled or not) between whom there was no reciprocity of honour. Like the decorations in some of our old abbeys, the gold has remained, while rottenness lies beneath. As thus they stood, Edward aloud exclaim'd, âChieftains! each door, molesting, we must seize, âAnd bay our Enemy. A neighbouring Isle, âMona, bestows her copious sustenance âOn Cambria's Prince, whence, ever, he supplies âHis famish'd gran'ries. That o'erflowing stream, âWe must cut off, or turn it to ourselves. âTalbot! regard thy Prince, and Venables, âMark thou my words. Repair, with needful force, â(E'en our stout Flemings, form'd for daring deeds) âDown to yon anchor'd ships, tracking our course, âAnd speed to Mona. Make that Isle your own.â Talbot replied. âThis honor and fair field, âWherein aspiring spirits may take root, âI, and brave Venables, grateful receive. âWhat valour may perform, from these our hands, âO King, require with rigid scrutiny. âFarewell! For loftiest fame, my kindling heart âBeats audibly. To gather fresh renown âInstant we speed.â âNow, Subjects!â Edward cried, âWe haste toward Denbigh. This must bless our arms; âNext Diserth falls, then Conway, and, at length, â(Barring unlook'd and hostile circumstance) âProud Snowdon, from whose pinnacle of clouds, âThe thundering shout shall tell our victory.â BOOK XIV. SCENE, The neighbourhood of Snowdon. Thrice fifteen thousand men, all stout of heart, Who felt the Patriot's fire, glow in their breast, And fed on freedom, round old Snowdon's base Gather'd, when Cambria call'd them to the war. In Dolbadarn, on Snowdon's misty brow, Llewellyn placed a band, long tried in war; And now the pride of hills, scarce cheer'd his sight, As on he march'd, toward Conway, to resist His mortal foe. Lo! speeding o'er the hills A man appears. One general impulse check'd The anxious host. The tidings, all alike, Waited impatient, but the prize he holds With niggard jealousy, passing them all, And hastens, panting, breathless, toward his Prince. Him having reach'd, he cried. âRhudland is fallen! âAnd Mervyn and his gallant bands are slain! âI only live to bear the deathful tale!â âAnd where the foe?â Llewellyn cried aloud. The ghastly man exclaim'd, âOn all sides round! âEast! North! and South! and West! Before! Behind!â âStop!â cried Llewellyn. âMan, pursue thy course! âSpeed hence! Away! Conceal thy trembling frame âIn some earth covert, or 'mid crags on high. âThou dost not follow here. Thy heart is made âOf a consistence, soft as yielding snow. âOff! Parley not!â Scarce had Llewellyn said, When, turning toward the south, the frighted man Fled like the startled roe-buck, looking on, With speed as of an arrow thro' the air. Llewellyn, to his chieftains, thus replied. âThis coward, whom our Cambria scorns to own, âWe may not credit; thick confusion blinds âHis surcharged faculties.â Another man! Speeding from Powis! âUrban! Well brave friend, (Llewellyn spake, impatient of his words) âWhat tidings bring'st thou?â Urban thus replied, âThy friends, in Dinevawr, are overpower'd! âWarwick, the Saxon Earl, bears all things down! âThat fertile realm he devastates; lays waste âOur stoutest castles. Streams of human gore âOn all sides flow, and now toward Powis-land âHe hastes, triumphant.â Loud, Llewellyn cried âStorm follows storm, yet, darker days than these âHave lower'd o'er Cambria, and her might call'd forth. âSoon, the portentous clouds, scatter'd appear'd, âWhilst the fair sun threw his inspiring beams âOn valour, sporting o'er the mountain heath, âAfter the toil of war. Chieftains renown'd, âMatured in victory, bright hours remain, âAnd feasts of joyance, but our strenuous arm âMust fight to gain the banquet. Noble friend, âRhywaldon, hither haste!â The chief draws near. Llewellyn spake. âTake with thee a fair force, âAnd speed toward Powis. Meet the English Earl. âAnd teach him, as thou canst, lesson austere.â Rhywaldon cried. âWhate'er true zeal may do âFrom me, O Prince, and courage, from the men âWhom now I lead to scourge our country's foe, âThou must not doubt. Awhile, brave Prince, farewell!â He said, and now a gallant company Follows Rhywaldon, whilst Llewellyn turns Toward Conway, to await the foe's advance. In Conway, Vychan govern'd, one as bold As ever led the fight, or from high tower, Arrow, or javelin hurl'd. When war arose Llewellyn cried. âConway, shall Vychan own. âAll will he do that bravery can perform.â When the third Henry pierced the Cambrian hills He first inhaled th' inebriate breath of fame; His name alone struck terror thro' the ranks That dared oppose him, for when he drew nigh, Tho' small his force, th' opposing army felt Secret forebodings, doubting that the laws, Common to man, in his peculiar case, Might be dispensed with, and his energies Force, with resistless fury, a new way To pre-doom'd victoryâsuch aspect high Triumph, long known, assumes. In Conway's towers, The key to Snowdon, (refuge ever found In dark extremity, to Cambria's lords) Vychan thus ruled. Hearing of Rhudland's fall, He knew that ere the sun oft in the east Illumed the firmament, before his gate, Edward would stand. Firm in his native strength, He knew and smiled. A herald hastens near. Aloud he cries. âSpread wide your massy gates! âCambria's high Lord advances!â Hastening on The Prince appears, and with him a vast host; The flower of warriors. As the towers they spy, Their resting-place, their step new ardour feels. So on Arabia's sands, at closing eve, The coursers, when they spy the goal in sight, Tho' breathless, sinking, panting, call afresh Upon their native vigour, and put forth The furious effort, sending from their heels Mists stretching far their dripping flanks the while, Like blossoms, scattering foam upon the wind: Thus as they fly, their outstretch'd nostrils pour Torrents impetuous, whilst their eyes of fire, Flashing, precede the thunder of their tread. Llewellyn now, amid the general shout, Passes the gate, the bridge. Vychan the brave, With reverence, bending low, as he approach'd, Waited his coming. With the courteous smile Llewellyn Vychan hail'd. Thus he began, âThou seest me Vychan, at unlook'd-for hour. âTh' unfolding circumstance calls us to act, âOft, wider from the path, fancy prescribed, âThan east from west. Edward, thro' this our land, âSo rumour tells, advances, once again âStriving to gain the fortune he has lost,â âHaply to shroud his spiring head in shame. âDeclare, brave man, what know'st thou of the war?â Vychan, low bending, thus his answer framed. âThe news hath reach'd, that Mervyn is no more; âThat Rhudland's castle, Edward hath subdued; âThat hosts of gallant men, in the hard fight, âThere perish'd, whilst the victor hastens on, âWith shout exultant, e'en to Conway's towers.â âLlewellyn cried. Doth he defy our power? âHe, of defeat and shame, still emulous, âHastes to sustain th' o'erwhelming thunderbolt âOf Cambria's ire. Let him advance! Our sword, âAnd spear, oft warm'd in slaughter, once again âShall teach him to respect vengeance like ours.â One to Llewellyn speeds, breathless and faint. Thus he began. âOur forests and tall trees, âBeneath the hostile axe, now prostrate groan. âEarl Mortimer, with a remorseless rage, âWars on the woodlands. Sylvan haunts and sweet, âThe Cambrians' joy, barren and bare now stand, âTheir glory gone, whilst he who views the waste, â(Remembering the tall tree and stately grove, âInviting late the thoughtful to their shade) âGlances and turns to weep. One of the most affecting passages in Josephus, is where he briefly describes the desolate vicinity of Jerusalem, after Titus had cut down all the wood, for ninety furlongs round, to prepare machines and erect mounts with which to assault the city. âIt was miserable,â says the Historian, âto behold that country and place, before, all beset with trees and fertile plants, now lie plain, like a desert, all cut down; neither was there any stranger that before time had seen Judea, and the beautiful suburbs of Jerusalem, who now beholding it, could abstain from tears.â The indirect way of displaying the devastations of war Josephus well knew to be the most effectually calculated to impress the mind. This principle he illustrated in another place, where he speaks of the enormous wickedness of the Jews, not by enumerating the disgusting and component parts of that wickedness, but by saying, âI will not cease to speak that which grief compelleth me. I verily think that had the Romans forborne to come against these Inhabitants, that either the earth would have swallowed the City up, or some deluge have drowned it, or the thunder and the lightning, which consumed Sodom, would have alighted upon it.â Yea, to this spot, âIf thou oppose him not, soon will he haste, âAnd cleanse his red spear in old Conway's tide.â Scarce had he ceas'd, when to the spot drew nigh, A posting man, who cried. âDiserth is fallen! âThat tower, so long the butt invincible âOf storms and wars, is fall'n! Edward our foe, âWith an o'erwhelming force, drew near and laid âHis hand on that stout fortress. On he hastes. âI scarce precede him.â With unbending brow, Llewellyn cried. âThis is a glorious day. âDangers I love. The thicker, more they cheer âMy bounding spirit. Subjects, hear your Prince! âNow do I see that the decisive hour âHastens indeed. This is a deeper plan, âA more profound adjustment of dark ways, âTo rob us of our homes and liberties, âThan Britons yet have known. All former skies âMerely have lower'd, but now, a fearful cloud, âBlack, as the midnight storm, hangs over us. âThe rain descends! The tempest raves in air! âOur valour, that naught human yet could tame, âThese perils and thick dangers shall disperse, âWith as much ease, as when emerging fresh âFrom the cool stream, 'mid burning suns and sands, âThe lion, reeking, shakes his shaggy mane, âAnd, lo, the drops are scatter'd.â Heart-oppress'd, Now, thinking of the Bishop, who had vow'd To use kind offices, Llewellyn sigh'd. In bitterness he uttered. âAged Sire! âLoved for thy virtues, venerable man, âOf Prelates, first and brightest ornament, âAs I foreknew, with a conviction deep, âI see that justice, reason, and thy voice, âSo powerful with the lenient and good heart, âHave fail'd to move thy breast of adamant, âO Edward! bane of freedom and all right! âI knew thy tyger appetite of blood! âI knew thy bitter and remorseless soul! âThy cravings for false fame, wading thro' streams, âYea, oceans of man's gore, if so it chanced, âThey cross'd the path that led to thy proud aims! âWherefore this momentary mist; my mind âShading with apprehension? Imp abhorr'd! âOff! I abjure thee! Now, I feel myself. âSubjects, regard your Prince! âHigh joy is mine, âThat the good hour advances, when our swords âWith England's force shall strive, and manifest âWith whom dwell courage and superior might. âFor ages, these Plantagenets, these hordes âFrom German wastes, and Norman, (of one kin, âDiffering in name, in nature both alike, âFierce, lawless, grasping at all rule and power,) âWith a relentless appetite, have striven âTo quench old Cambria. This sequester'd spot, â(Where Freedom fled, from th' accursed chains âAnd galling fetters, rude barbarians brought âTo our green island) long, dark jealousy âHath moved in England's veins. She look'd around, âAnd Slavery saw, where'er the orb of heaven âScatter'd his beam, and cheering was the sight; âTill with a scowling eye, o'er her own fields, âTeeming, she look'd toward these our craggy hills, âAnd, like another Haman, she exclaim'd, ââBe peace and happiness from this my heart âEstranged, till the resister of my power, âThis Mordecai, hangs 'mid the cope of Heaven!â âEach Saxon Potentate, age after age, âStrove to subdue old Cambria, but our sires, âImmersed in brav'ry, met them, 'mid these hills, âWhere now we stand, and sent, whom slaughter spared, âBack to recount their deep discomfiture. âHis father might have toldâEdward our foe, âHow vain the enterprise and hazardous, â'Gainst rocks and freedom, but his father's lore âHe scorns; resolved to learn, whate'er it cost, âThe lesson we will teach. Howell, attend! âThis Mortimer, levelling our ancient woods, âO Chief! Speed toward him! With thy gallant band, âScourge his temerity. Barrier so strong â'Tween us and England, with strict vigilance, âWe must preserve. A service of high worth âTo this thy country.â Howell, lowly bent Pressing his heart, and now he speeds to stem The lofty and wood-warring Mortimer. Llewellyn and brave Vychan now prepare, With all the Patriot's zeal, firm, resolute, To meet the fray. They knew that it drew near, The war of heroes, fierce and deadly strife, And each brow wore the smile of confidence. BOOK XV. SCENE, The Castles of Rhudland and Denbigh. When Rhudland fell, due sepulture was given To those, on either side, who never more Must see the sun arise; who felt their hearts Beat with anxiety for coming scenes Of victory, which in fair fancy's eye, Distinct they saw, (there only to be seen) But who are now for ever veil'd in night. Earth opens to receive their mangled frames, While, like a mist, hovering Forgetfulness Waits, to conceal their last faint memory, And launch them, with the unrecorded names, Into oblivion's dark and lethal wave. As these were in the decent death-bed laid, With pitying heart, Edward beheld and sigh'd. Silent he stood. His chieftains brave around, Felt like their monarch, and like him they gazed, Still, motionless, oppress'd with grief, chastised, And sympathy that needed not vain words. âNow,â Edward cried, âduties of other kind, âBefit the warrior. Tho' we mourn, sincere, âOur brethren fall'n, it is the fate of war. âTheir presence and their pleasant company âCheer'd us, when living; now they are no more, âWith courtesy and kindness, we will speak âOf all their virtues, and, their memory, âDeposit in the casket of our heartâ âA jewel rare! Bravery and worth, farewell!â This said, the monarch and his veterans bold Turn'd and toward Diserth, urged their eager course. It fell at their approach. A chief was there, Coel, alike unknown to war and fameâ By clamorous wealth exalted. Courage true In hour disastrous, like a broken vase, Scornful was cast aside, whilst the young sprout Of coward opulence (by interest raised, And words imposing on Llewellyn's ear) Pass'd on, the gaudy wreath upon his brow, Scoffing on valour's child. His smoking board Rich, copious, to the victor foe he left. Most bitter penance, and, whilst hunger spake Clamourous within, where only he might feel, Heedless of all beside, safety he sought! O Cambria, blush for this thy coward son! Edward, to Denbigh hastes. There other fare, And harder blows, await the English host. At Denbigh, that wild castle 'mid the hills, Cynan abode, whose heart of iron form'd, Throve in the tempest. Boldness he possess'd, (From an insensible and callous mind) A horse-like absence of all fear, a soul Fierce to perform the shuddering enterprize; Where wisdom was not; whilst confusion none He ever felt, when loftiest hopes and words, By disappointment bay'd, raised the loud laugh: Lord Bacon, like a sage, thus reflects on the mere quality of Boldness. âBoldness is a child of ignorance and baseness, but nevertheless it doth fascinate, and bind hand and foot those that are either shallow in judgment, or weak in courage, which are the greatest part; yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak times: therefore we see it hath done wonders in popular states, but with senates and princes less; and more even on the entrance of bold persons into action, than soon after, for boldness is an ill keeper of promises. Surely as there are mountebanks for the natural body, so there are mountebanks for the politic body: men that undertake great cures, and perhaps have been lucky in two or three experiments, but want the grounds of science and therefore cannot hold out: nay you shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomel's miracle. Mahomet made the people believe that he would call a hill to him, and from the top of it offer up his prayers for the observers of his law. The people assembled. Mahomet called the hill to come to him, again and again; and when the hill stood still, he was never a wit abashed, but said, âIf the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet will go to the hill.â So these men, when they have promised great matters, and failed most shamefully, yet if they have the perfection of boldness, they will but slight it over and make a turn and then no more ado. Certainly to men of great judgment, bold persons are a sport to behold; nay, and to the vulgar, also, boldness hath somewhat of the ludicrous: for if absurdity be the subject of laughter, doubt you not but great boldness is a sport to see when a bold fellow is out of countenance for that puts his face into a most shrunken and wooden posture. This is well to be weighed, that boldness is ever blind, for it seeth not dangers and inconvenience, therefore it is ill in counsel, good in execution: so that the right use of bold persons is, that they never command in chief, but be seconds, and under the directions of others. For in counsel it is good to see dangers and in execution not to see them, except they be verygreat.â Save breast that knew not terror, and oft scorn'd What wiser minds had troubled, from his birth, Nothing that verged on virtue he might boast. A spirit turbulent was his, which made Warfare his passion. Many a night he lay, Sleepless and weary, fearing lest the strife, The stream of fight, should thro' some channel flow Distant from him, nor he participate In rapturous tumults and the luxury Of contests and alarms. Mournful he cried. The pouring of the inmost spirit forth. âIn this sequester'd and inglorious spot âCynan must wane, fate-bound, and girt with bands âCoward befitting. I, whose boyish eyes, âSpears only charmed, and whose first joys arose âFrom chase of men, whose sword, with blood imbrued, âThe she-wolf follow'd, for her famish'd young âSpeediest supply. Now, like the oak I stand, âSmother'd in forest wilds. In vain, my arms âCourt the rough blast, and pant, on some wide heath, âTo dare the tempest. I must linger here, âAnd from some straggling man, learn of the warâ âOf others deeds, of fame and deathless wreaths âWon from the Saxon, haply, by some lance, âLess known to slaughter and heroic deeds âThan this (tho' useless here) this barbed shaft âThat hath o'ercome the mighty. O my Prince, âWhy didst thou plant, a shoot, so strong as mine, âSo form'd for combat with the winds of heaven, âIn soil like this, where the thin scanty mould âScarce hides the rock impervious, form'd alone âFor grass and roots of tiny filaments. âYe passing birds, take me upon your wing! âBear me from this eternal solitudeâ âThis grave of valour. Let me look around âAnd see how runs the war, and bear my part, âIn scattering like a tempest, vengeance, round.â Stay, mournful chief! Anon, and thou shalt see The sight thou covetest. Cynan was old, Or passing on to brown maturity. His youth had budded in contentions fierce, And still the same, he loved the furious fray, The combat and the plain thick strew'd with death. With appetite perverse, his food was war, Sought earnest out, yea, never wrong he bore Nor insult, that nice scrutiny might spy, Else venial, from the proudest man who breath'd. Even the injurious thought, that pass'd the tongue, Tho' dream its vehicle, and light as down, Or gossamer, marching before the breeze, In him uproused the storm and hurricane. A cruel man was he, denying God, Scorning his threats. An Atheist, not in wordâ In heart, in life. He had an only Son. All evil thoughts and evil purposes Sprang in his breast uncheck'd. Throughout the day, His mind was bulwark'd round and fortified Against all virtue. He the bitter curse, Not the paternal blessing, ceaseless heard, With threats of vengeance. From his father's wrongs Unnumber'd, he escaped. he looked behindâ A monster follow'd hardâhe knew his Sire! And to escape his wrath, the dagger raised! He look'd againâhe plunged it to his heart! âA Hero!â Cynan cried. âMagnanimous!â Seeking the distant Champion, in one year, Cynan four Warriors slew, all known to fame. No partial thoughts were his, when he beheld His character in jeopardy. True friends, And faithful, long and dearly prized, Who deem'd, that human arm, near or far off, His spear might vanquish, to the fight he call'd; Yea, while he wish'd them each successive good, Earth could bestow, by hard necessity, He felt himself compell'd, owning their worth, To slay them, and thus guard his hallow'd name. âJohn Owen ap John ap Meredith, killed Howell ap Madoc Vaughan, of Berkin, for no other quarrel, but for the mastery of the countrey, and for the first good-morrow.ââSir John Wynne. Sir John Wynne, though the historian of a particular family, has incidentally given much valuable information on the ancient domestic state of Wales. From him we learn that quarrels between neighbours, and branches of the same family, were often continued for ages, whilst assassinations were perpetrated almost with impunity, without either disgrace or punishment attaching to seconds and accessaries. It appears that no country was ever afflicted more, for many ages, with intestine divisions than the Principality. Edward the First effected the great object of uniting Wales with England, but both Edward and his successors experienced on various occasions how difficult it was to establish there the English Statute Laws. The Cambrians were attached to their own laws and usages, in no ordinary degree, nor was it till the reign of Henry the Eighth that the English Jurisprudence was fully extended to Wales. In a country thus situated, where the native laws were imperfectly administered, or rather virtually abrogated, while none or incompetent penalties attached to any violations of the moral duties; and when at the same time the laws of the conquering nation were withheld from an apprehension that they might awaken fatal commotions, what could be expected, but what was found really to exist, general suspicion, perpetual feuds, and terrific enormities. It was usual for the great men, at this time, to keep in their houses and pay, both for assault and defence, stout and staunch murderers, or Llawrudds, as they were called (men with the bloody hand) who were always in high request and repute. We read of some who kept in their houses, or immediate vicinity, from fifty to seventy of such men, who were accustomed instantly to assemble at the sound of their master's horn. The happy and virtuous state of modern Wales when contrasted with its former situation, exhibits a memorable example of the beneficent effect to be produced by sound laws and good principles. The ancient state of Wales may be collected from the following anecdote, from Sir John Wynne. âIn the Countrey adjoining to Nantconway, there was continually fostered a Wasp's Nest, which troubled the whole countrey, which was a Sanctuary. This peculiar jurisdiction, became a receptacle of thieves and murderers. Noe spot within twenty miles was safe from their incursions and robbery and what they got was their own. In this lawless district, Meredith (a principal man in North Wales) built a family mansion, intending to fix there his future residence. Being questioned by his friends, why he meant to leave his ancient house and habitation and to dwell in Nantconway, swarming with thieves and murderers, he replied, âThat he should find elbowe room in that vast countrey, among the bondmen, and that he would rather fight with outlaws and thieves, than with his own blood and kindred; for if I live in mine own honse in Evioneth, said he, I must either kill mine own kinsmen or be killed by them.â As a farther illustration also of the ancient state of Wales, the Uncle of Sir John Wynne had pulled down a Church which was built in a thicket and built one larger and better in a plain. The Nephew required his Uncle's motive, when he replied, âHe had reason for the same, because the countrey was wild, and he might be oppressed by his enemies on the suddaine, in that woodie countrey; it therefore stood him in a policie to have diverse places of retreat. Certaine it was, that he durst not goe to church on a Sunday, from his house of Penanmen, but he must leave the same guarded with men, and have the doores sure barred and boulted, and a watchman to stand at the Garreg big, during divine service (a rock whence he might see both the church and the house) and raise the cry if the house was assaulted. He durst not, though he was guarded with twenty tall archers, make known when he went to church or elsewhere, or go and come the same way through the woodes and narrowe places, lest he should be layed for.â A man under such circumstances, when at church, must have repeated with peculiar emphasis, âFrom sudden death, good Lord deliver us!â Thro' a long life of glorious enterprize, (Falsely so call'd, of rancour, of revenge, Of murderâveild, 'neath honor's specious garb!) He had sustain'd contentions numberless, Where wounds, not slight, were the brave Champion's meed; These were his joy, his pride, scars of renown! His highest boast, with culture, now become. So thick and flourishing, that Cynan's face (Once comely, of proportioned size and form, Now bruis'd, and scarr'd, and mangled, and deform'd, With sturdy fragments, here and there rent off By boisterous war, his own dear heart's delight,) Shew'd a wild waste of shapeless lineaments. One eye had perish'd, when his furious sword, Slew Reged, and the other scarce remain'd, Firm in its socket, since that glorious day, When he o'ercame the giant of the hill, Huge Colbrand, terror of surrounding lands, Beating him down the fearful precipice, Himself fast rolling after, not by shrubs Stay'd in his course, bramble, or creeping heath, 'Mid the declivity, strew'd here and there, But, sent, head-foremost, on, from rock to rock; For which, when to the distant dell he came, He still had life enough, comfort to feel, That he but follow'd where the vanquish'd led. A passing Friar, once told him of his faith, A burden and a yoke, easy and light, A race, which had the promise of this world, And, higher still, of that which is to come. His deeds were evil, how could he believe! He scoff'd, and hasten'd to the strife he loved. Llewellyn heard his fame, for courage true, (The rest he left to Heaven) and to reward Valour like his, placed him in Denbigh's tower. Ere fetter'd habit rose rebellious, With transport Cynan's spirits overflow'd. No forms of happiness he envied there, Whether the buzzing fly, free as the wind, The gliding fish, that graceful moved along, With a profusion of the rainbow shades; The bird that wanton'd in the firmament, Or the lone lion, monarch of the wood, That unrestrain'd went forth, and clogg'd his fang With gore of all who dared his power dispute. Raised thus to eminence of warlike state, (His hopes and his ambition now complete) He drank the full tide of felicity; Till, to obstruct his joy and blast his peace, War, upward started from his slumbering couch, And shook his limbs, and seized his massy spear, And went forth, beaming terror from his eyes, To shake the nations. Cynan then was sad. His foot was chain'd to the abiding rock. In all the luxury of fruitless grief, He pass'd his moments, fearing, lest the wave Should lash some distant shore, and the loud peal Round the far mountain roll. The mists retire! Hope starts to life! for now the faithful sun Scarce reach'd th' horizon, when, fast drawing near, Edward appear'd! The spacious hill displayed, O'er which he came, one colour, not its own, The dark approach of multitudes, whose forms, Ever in motion, o'er th' obstructing space, Pass'd earnest, like cloud-shadows o'er the sea. As thus they hasten'd, Cynan, at the sight, From the tall towerâwell nigh the battlement Had leap'd for joy. Hast'ning impetuous down, To those beneath, he cried. âShout for the chase! âThe game is up! The lion hither hastes! âLift high your spear!â Never to meet the foe, Brave men, their armour braced, more light of heart, Or seized the keen-edg'd sword. Thro' all the place, Each eye was joy. The sailing cloud, aloft, Dark-low'ring, with electric matter fraught, And latent fires, that with a steady eye Beholds some pinnacle, destin'd to fall Before its rage, and urges on its course To meet its prey, tho' distant, with resolves Unwavering, till the destin'd moment comes, When in one crash profound, earthward the pile Falls headlong, and with ruin strews the plain:â Like this contunder of the aerial spheres, Edward on Denbigh, gazed, and swore to plant George and the cross, upon its proudest spire;â Approaching firm, with undiverted step, And calling it his own, while yet the eye Dimly descried its towers, melting away Into the faint blue sky. He saw his foe, And to ward him, with slow pace and steadfast gaze Press'd onward, with the courser's aim, that turns Nor to the right, nor left: and now he stands, With his victorious force, full fronting it, Edward exclaim'd aloud. âFollow your Prince! âOnce more, I lead you on to victory.â Ere that dread word was utter'd, all the scene Spake harmony. The sun in central sky Sat like a monarch, whilst the silver clouds Studded the canopy, and round his throne Crowded obeisant;âwith their sumptuous robes, Quenching, in mist, mortal's too careless eye, That pried into the springs of light, unbless'd With stable organs, privileged of heaven. All spirit-lulling sounds lived in that hour. The birds their ruder notes, in earlier morn, With prodigal felicity, had sent On the unquiet winds, and now their voice Faintly was heard; languid responses told The soothing influence of the noon-tide ray. The passing breeze so faintly stirr'd himself, That nought but the Witch's Elm-leaf, flapping round In very sport and wantonness of joy, Told of his unfelt presence; whilst, to fill The chalice of soul-soothing influence, The mountain-stream, afar, faintly was heard; Sounds that to silence, bore affinity So intimate, that long they might be heard, And doubt scarce rise at last, that they were sent From moving thing, 'till the slow-gazing eye Saw sunny lines, broken, amid the hills, And the acuter mind, full-clear defined The distant waterfall. At such an hour, So tranquil, and adverse to violence, When even the timid animal went forth From his close haunt, peaceful to browse and bask, Even now, with hostile front, Edward drew near And Cynan bared his halberd for the war. The sky is lowering. He conceals his head, Bright source of glory. Night alone befits Such scenes and sounds, as now are gathering up Their congregated force, with hell-hound rage To mar the hour, and cast a deathful hue Over creation. Ah! The work begins! The assaulting ladders throng the battlements! Discord and clashing shield now sound in air! The banner waves in blood! Falchion and spear, Alternate, bend and rise, whilst ever round, With grating dissonance, the whizzing dart Passes, one moment heard, slaughter's best friend. Now on the topmost rampart, fluttering gay, The English pennon waves, and the loud shout Of âvictoryâ rises. Cynan frantic cried, To his near phalanx, (now, as fury fierce, And desperate, 'mid their mangled friends around,) âNot all is lost! With courage such as ours, âWhat shall we fear? One daring effort more, âAnd, death or triumph! Cynan leads you on!â Edward, upon the Cambrian wall, first placed His steadfast foot. That moment, on his helm, A battle-axe descended, fierce and full. Th' aggressor slain, fearless he downward leap'd. His sword deals vengeance! What shall strength avail, And valour, 'gainst a band of glittering spears? Fly Cavendish! Warren and Lincoln fly! Edward now strives with an assailing host! He is in jeopardy! And at this hour, Needs your stout lance! A thousand from the walls, Leap'd headlong, when they saw their monarch's sword, Striving with Cynan, fierce as the robb'd bear. The strife, with blacker fury, raves around. Confused and deathful sounds and shouts and groans, Commingling, fill the air, urging the heart To fiercer deeds and wilder vehemence. Ah, Cynan! Thou hast felt the mighty force Of Edward's sword! Thy sinewy chest hath heaved, And rent itself in one hard struggling groan! Lo! He expires! Warrior! Thy doom, at length, Is hurried on. Thy barren days are pass'd, And, Oh! the future!âThou wilt never dwell With the disciple of the Nazarene! The meek in heart, the peaceful and the pure. Heaven were no Heaven to thee. Thou shalt behold, Far off, beyond the deep and rayless gulf, Impassible, that bounds the evil world, Up, mid sun-blazing thrones, the Patriarchs, Prophets, and holy men, lights of the world, Long doom'd to toilâstorm-beaten mariners, Their haven there, and their abiding rest! But there, thou shalt not come! While sights of bliss, For ever forfeited, shall but augment The crushing load; the self-accusing thought; The deep and unimaginable pang Of the rebellious spirit. While on earth, Slaughter with thee was a familiar thing! (Thy noblest passion!) Thou didst thirst for war As for a merry wake and pastime gay, Where thou might'st cheer thyself and plume afresh Thy soaring pinions: Thou hast had thy wish, Full, to the uttermost.âNo more shalt thou Covet terrestrial fame, and feed thy dreams With high achievementâa dark sepulchre Waits to receive thy head; a narrow house On which no cheering sun-beam shall alight, And where e'en glory's voice, on thy dull ears, Shall fall, unnoticed, like the snow of night!â Low were thy aims and vain thy earthly joys, All evil, germ of the perverted heart, Yet, for these passing shadows of delight, Brief as the bubbles on the stormy lake, Without a sigh, thou yieldest up thy crownâ The smile of Heaven, the favour of thy Godâ The hope that gilds the precincts of the grave!â Tho' thus their chief, mangled and breathless lay, Cambria's surviving sons, fight, fiercer grown As dangers thicken. Edward cries aloud, âQuarter receive! Bravery, like yours we prize.â No more his voice they heed than bellowing winds The whispering thistle-down. Blow follows blow. They seek alone, in death, to hide their shame. Brave sons of valour, the impetuous storm Sweeps you like sand, from the bare bleachen rock. The last man rears his sword! The last hath felt The mortal spear, deep in his vitals thrust! From his weak grasp the ponderous weapon falls, And 'mid the wrath, the whirlwind storm of fate, Closed his sad eyes, in everlasting shade. No foe surviving, blood and carnage round, And waste and death, a melancholy mist Shaded each mind, and languidly the sheath, Whilst silence reign'd, received its gory friend. Triumph so wont, with boisterous shout to hear His glad approach, exulting in the sound, Oppress'd with anguish, turn'd aside to weep! Even reason, with hard effort, scarcely proved That there was cause of joy; such pungent thoughts, Crowded, unbidden, on the victor's mind. Edward exclaim'd, thrice he essay'd to speak. âThese were brave men. Whoe'er still languishes, âShall, on a couch of down, rest, and our zeal âShall sooth his pangs, our hearts shall honor him.â A shout is heard! Loud and more loud, the noise Pours on the ear. âPrince David! rent the sky. âThe brave Prince David!â To the King he hastes. Edward, one hand, slow resting on his shield, The other on his sword, welcom'd the Prince. âAnd what the news?â he cried. âWho of thy friends, âObedient at thy voice, our cause espouse? âRecount the whole. Leave thou no name behind.â On David's brow a pensive languor sat. Not with an eager step sought he the King, But leisurely approach'd and thus began. âHail honor'd Potentate! Truth must declare, âTho' I before thee stand, stable of heart, âAnd as the rock, inflexible, and sworn âTo aid thy cause and hurl destruction's brand âOn proud LlewellynâTruth must sorrowing own âThat I have fail'd, for all substantial ends, âIn my late mission to our Powis-land.â âFail'd!â Edward cried. âI thought thou saidst thy friends, âCountless and true, required but one nod, âTo rise, vindictive, in thy injured cause!â âI thought it.â David, in mild accent, spake. He sigh'd, and then in louder tone began. âThe natural current of man's heart is changed. âThe chiefs, whom once I knew, and who have erst âPlighted their friendship, vow'd eternal truth, âWith heart fidelity, from some deep cause, âSome secret ties and hell-born influence, âTho' once their idol, to my every word âTurn a deaf ear. To Morghan, my old friend âI spake of thee. Instant his eye-ball glow'd âWith savage fury: grasping his huge sword, âHe sought my life.â âTraitor,â he cried, âthis blade âShall hide thy shame.â No coward in such scenes, âI met his blows, and after a hard strife, âI slew him. Other warriors spurn'd my words, âNot without threats. Two noble men at length, âPlighted their faith, and swore, with vehemence, âTo aid our causeâEnon, and Corf the blind. âToward thee I lead them, in my heart resolved âTo compensate, by my own valourous deeds, âFor other's languor, and the dastard zeal âPowis display'd when David call'd to arms. Edward exclaim'd. âEnon and Corf shall share âNo common welcome. To their grateful King, âLead them, I wait their presence.â David spake, With faltering accent, âThis I meant to say. âThe omission pardon! As we journey'd here, âOn the first night, when the black cloud came on, âEnon, whom fiends pursue! turn'd, faithless, back, âBut Corf is constant, and his voice alone, âWill bring a host of warriors to the field. âGreat is his influence. At the gate he stands.â His rising thought, Edward with toil repress'd. âWell,â he exclaim'd âCorf is a gallant man. âHis fame is wide: conduct him to our sight.â David retired and instant, at the gate, Sought aged Corf (a warrior once renown'd, Fear'd by the mighty, tho' now blind and old, His prowess vanish'd, yet whose limbs retain'd Proof of past vigour and an eminence Which once no rival fear'd;âeven as the shaft, The stately column, which still testifies The temple, or the fallen city proud.) David beheld him not. Eager he look'd, No Corf was there. Backward he pensive walk'd, Clenching his hand. The King he now beholds, Who thus began. âWell David, our true friend, âWhere is old Corf?â Never till this good hour, Did David hesitate in prompt reply, But now, a moment's space, silent, he stood. âWhere is brave Corf,â again, the King exclaim'd. With furnace heat the cheek of David glow'd, And now, with angry tone, thus he replied. âAn aged traitor! On his name and race, âCurses alight! Whilst, toward thee, first, I sped, âThe grey-hair'd man, blind as the owl at noon, âPondered on Powis, till, at length, he cried, âShew me the way! My own dear native land, âI will not sell thee! As he spake, he turn'd âAnd rush'd to seek the road by which he came. âBlind dotard, as he urged his dubious way, âYon stream obstructed him. Undoubting harm, âHeadlong he rush'd; he plunged into the tide! âAnd now upon the margin of the stream, âBreathless he lies, thus punish'd for false faith.â Cried Edward (who, in serious purposes And hours of mute solemnity, indulged, When strange occurrences lit the gay thought, And spite of his austere rebuking will, Sometimes, the natural bias of a smile,) Sir Thomas More never appears more amiable than when, writing to his daughters from a distance, he compliments them on having begun the study of Astronomy, and in referring to their proficiency, pleasantly tells them that he understands âthey can already distinguish between the Sun and the Moon.â The Enthusiast never smiles, neither did Kouli Khan. Cried Edward, âOn myself, chiefly I rest, âThus, such disasters, with light heart I heed.â âWith no upbraiding words, hear me, good Prince. ââThy battlements, and steel-encompass'd walls; âThy valourous friends, countless, and their stout spears, âSo old in victory, who at thy voice, âWere to leap up spontaneous and come forth, âIn terrors deck'd, to hurl upon our foe, âDeath and dismay:âThese visions and proud scenes âHave vanish'd! All is mist! One friend of thine âMost faithful, when thou whisper'dst but my name, âUprais'd his sword, and hardly didst thou hold âThy ancient fame, by slaying thy true friend! âUnwearied toil, two triumphs now achieved, âAnd thou didst hasten near, Corf at thy heels, âA faithful shadow, whilst that other chief, âEnon, so famed in war, when the first cloud âNight mantled o'er the earth, offer'd him scope, âVanish'd like lightning! But old Corf was true. âYet when thou sought'st my presence, with sad tale, âThe little was made less, and he, too, fled! â'Till the unkindly stream swallow'd him up! âAnd here at length thou stand'st, David, alone! âMost unpropitious embassy is thine!â Shame and confusion sat on David's cheek, Till, 'mid the stormy tumult of his mind, Utterance he found. âSpare me thy words, O King! âMy soul is firm! These base and treacherous men, âI loath their names! Corf bears his punishment. âAnd Enon shall, erelong, feel on his head âThe thunder of my arm. I will pursue âThat traitor to the confines of the stars! âTho' I have err'd and deem'd my influence, âGreater than truth, yet, my desires remain, âMy spirit is stability and strength. âEdward! My heart is thine. Whate'er this arm, âThis sword, can in thy cause perform, O King! âThou hast it! I will live for thee alone.â Edward replied. âDavid, full confidence âIn thee do I repose. Tho' on thy head âKeen disappointment rests, this is no crime. âTho' thus rebuff'd, thou wilt full scope possess âOf serving me, of building for thyself, âFame and a stable house, a princedom proud âGreat as thy sire's, the far-famed Roderi, Roderi or Roderic, surnamed âthe Greatâ was the ancestor of Llewellyn, and the most illustrious of the Welsh Princes. âAnd greater who would claim? yet ere that hour âOne service I require. Hear thou my words. âTalbot and Venables, just have I sent âToward Mona, to subdue that fertile isle. âThou know'st it well! Familiar to thy feet, âThou wilt assist them. There thine influence, âMay rise more flourishing. Seek yonder barks, âNigh Rhudland's walls. This signet be thy key, âThy passport and authority. That isle, âSubdued to England, I have other paths, âFruitful of honor, where thy feet shall roam.â David replied, âEach valley and each hill, âMona may boast, hath by my curious eye âOft been explored, and there, Prince David's name âWill raise a host of spears. Around his staff, âThousands will flock, whom I will win to thee.â David scarce gone, lo! to the Monarch's sight, Warren advances, bending dutiful; Whilst follow slow the Cambrian Hostages. See Vol. I. p. 195. Edward beheld them, and aloud exclaim'd, âLlewellyn is your murderer! For death, âInstant, prepare!â The Hostages bent low, Save one alone. Slowly he gazed around, Firm, fearless, with defiance in his eyeâ Gwenwynn's proud heir. Earnest, the King inquired, âWhence is yon crowd unusual? and the voice âOf harmony I hear?â As Edward stood Doubting the cause, behold! in sable garb, Bearing an unknown corse slow to the grave, A company of mourning men advance Pouring the plaintive note. The King exclaim'd, âIt is a Funeral! We will attend. âWisdom is here. This soon will be our lot. âWith such a sight in view, we will bestow âOne hour to seriousness.â A Band precedes, Clothed in white robes, pouring the Hymn to God. If the following stanzas should be found to possess any dignity, it is, that much of the language and that most of the thoughts are derived from the Rich Mine of the Scriptures. The idea of Recitative and Response, was taken from the Hebrew Poetry. THE BAND. First Voice. Lord! Thou our dwelling-place hast been, Our hope since first to life we came; Man changes with the changing scene, But thou art evermore the same. Response. Sceptres and thrones, the blaze of power, Yea all that charms the heart, the eye, Will dwell with praise their little hour, And like a scroll be passed by. First Voice. But thou unmoved shalt still remain, Encircled in thy robe of light; Thou thro' perpetual years shalt reign When sun and stars are quench'd in night. Response. Fountain of Good, for ever pure, All worlds to thee their homage pay; And thy memorial shall endure When earth and heaven are swept away. First Voice. Thy chamber is the boundless sea, Where all earth's streams a refuge find; The clouds of heaven thy chariot be, Thou ridest on the stormy wind. Response. Thou, unconfined by space or time, Display'st thy power thro' endless years; In every age, in every clime, The Majesty of God appears. First Voice. Thy mandate gave creation birth; From chaos nature rose divine; The deep foundations of the earth, The everlasting hills are thine. Response. We see Thee in the opening morn, We view thee in the clouds of eve, And generations yet unborn Shall drink the transport we receive. First Voice. When to the heavens we raise our eye, O'erwhelming wonders there we see; We trace thro' all the spangled sky The Finger plain of Deity. Response. Sphere on sphere, with dance and song, There sweep to thee their airy lyre; Thou lead'st the Morning Star along, Thro' a wilderness of fire. First Voice. The Moon august thou badest shine, Whilst round the burden'd concave glows; Thou spak'st, and at the voice divine, Ten thousand shouting worlds arose! Response. There Arcturus passes on, Sun-like thro' his lapse of years; Orion, with his starry zone, There in all his pomp appears. First Voice. There the Pleiades proclaim Glory to thee, the Lord on High! Whilst all the planets sing the same In their circle round the sky. Response. Tho' countless Orbs thro' Ether roll, These are atoms, power confined; Thou didst create the Human Soul, Spark of thy Eternal Mind! First Voice. Higher still, the Angel Choir, With all the glorious Hosts above, Sprang from thee, Almighty Sire! Source of Being! Fount of Love! Response. On Earth, âOmnipotence!â we hear, Express'd from every form and sense; Whilst Heaven, with accent still more clear, Again repeatsââOmnipotence!â Chorus. Thy throne, O God! shall stand secure, And age to age thy praise rehearse; Thine altar is the Spirit Pure! Thy temple is the Universe! THE MOURNERS. First Voice. What man is he who breathes the air, And shall not to the tomb descend? The march of Glory ceases there, And there Earth's proudest Pageants end! Response. Let our hearts with transport glow, We have a hope, a glorious trust; Thy worshippers, O Father! know, That thou wilt raise their sleeping dust. First Voice. Aged Traveller! to the grave, With many a tear, we bear thee on; Now, beyond each swelling wave, Thou to endless rest art gone. Response. Aged Father! Aged Saint! Sorrow's cup to thee was given; But thou hast breath'd thy last complaint, Perfected and call'd to Heaven. First Voice. Ere his Crown the Righteous wears, In his Pilgrimage below, Many sorrows, many cares, Must his Spirit undergo. Response. Ere the Oak, in all his power, Spreads his stately limbs mature, Many a sun-shine, many a shower, Wind and rain must he endure. First Voice. God speaks from his eternal throne, And flaming hosts his will perform; He hath his fearful path unknown In the whirlwind and the storm. Response. Twilight veils our prospects here, But we haste to perfect day, Where the doubtful shall be clear, And the darkness pass away. First Voice. Behold the Upright Man and mark How he concludes his mortal race, When every earthly view is dark, And Death draws near with solemn pace. Response. Of Heaven's unchanging promise sure, Patient he waits his soul's release; And as his life was calm and pure, So when he dies his end is peace. Chorus. May we so pass our time below, Mercy our hope, and Faith our friend, That when we leave this world of woe, Our lives may, like the Righteous, end! Earl Warren cried. âI will inquire. This song âSuits not the vulgar mind. Perchance a friend, âOne whom we loved, now passes to his grave.â Edward replied, âWithhold! Break not the trance! âTheir plaintive voice touches a chord within. âThere is a magic power in harmony, âThrice heighten'd in the requiem o'er the Dead. âAgain the Song!â THE BAND. First Voice. Is there a God who deigns to dwell With heirs of frailty here below? Is there, too, a heaven, a hell, Eternal worlds of joy or woe? Response. God shall thunder from the skies, Whilst their trump Arch-Angels blow; At the voice, the Dead shall rise, All to endless joy or woe. First Voice. The earth, to her remotest bound, Feels conflict and portentous throes; Heard you that blast? It was the sound Which from the last loud clarion rose! Response. The Grave no longer holds her dead, But, all uprising, solemn, slow, With humble hope, or silent dread To meet th' Almighty Father go. First Voice. Before my sight, like clouds they rise, What countless myriads throng the air! Their number dims the burning skies Which cast around their fearful glare. Response. Jehovah! On the cloud he rides, Distinct I see him borne along; O'er fields of ether bright he glides, Surrounded by the Seraph Throng. First Voice. Tempests their mingled wrath display, Whirlwinds and hail, before, are sent; Mysterious fires around him play, Whilst thunders shake the firmament. Response. He rides upon a Cherub Form, Leaving the worlds of light on high, And, on the pinion of the storm, Comes sailing down the nether sky. First Voice. Darkness involves his presence there, Not to be pierced by mortal sight; And his pavilion, though the air, Is water and the cloud of night. Response. Ten thousand Angels fly before, His silent and adoring train; Ten thousand times ten thousand more Chaunt aloud the choral strain. First Voice. In wrath he scatters all his foes, On every side his arrows fly; His lightning, like a torrent, flows In liquid radiance thro' the sky. Response. Heaven, earth, and ocean's farthest isle, In one wide vollying flame appear! Now may the Righteous look and smile, For their redemption draweth near. Chorus. Ye ardent Spirits, curb your fire, Nor dare those awful scenes display; No mortal hand must sweep the lyre, Which sings that unimagined day. THE MOURNERS. First Voice. Men are but sojourners on earth, Strangers, as their fathers were; Men are pilgrims, from their birth Fast passing from a world of care. Response. Time like an arrow speeds its way, Grief soon consumes our early bloom; 'Tis but a short and cheerless day Between the Cradle and the Tomb. First Voice. Like the rainbow's fleeting vest, Like the gorgeous morning sky, Like the sun that sinks to rest, Mortal man is born to die. Response. Life is a tale, a bud of spring, That withers while it charms the sight; Compared to every passing thing, A cloud, a vision of the night. First Voice. Man is but grass, a fading flower, And tho' in pride he towers elate, His life is but a stormy hour, And vanity his best estate. Response. Alternate passions hold their sway, We burn with hope, or freeze with dread; Whilst all are hurrying fast away To swell the armies of the dead. First Voice. One moment we behold the sun, And count our pleasures o'er and o'er; The next, our thread of life is spun, And busy man is seen no more. Response. We leave the cheerful day, alone, To combat with death's fearful blast; To plunge into a world unknown, To dwell with generations past. First Voice. Yes, earth to earth must be our doom! Erelong and death will end our care! Cold and dreary is the tomb, And perpetual silence there. Response. Soon we must leave this glorious sky, Soon with clay be covered o'er,â Where friend by friend shall silent lie Till the heavens be no more! Chorus. So teach us, Lord! To spend our days, That we Eternal Life may see;â With Saints and Seraphs, shout thy praise, And wave our palms of victory. THE BAND. First Voice. Call'd from all we loved below! Call'd to Judgment in the sky! Tho' reluctant, forced to go! Call'd to Immortality! Response. Stupendous word! Mysterious state! Immortal! At th' o'erwhelming sound, My spirit sinks beneath the weight, And shudders o'er a vast profound. First Voice. Eternal being! time no more! An end of this material frame! A life, when countless years are o'er, Beginning still! yet still the same! Response. In vain we trace the boundless maze, The thought o'erpowers our labouring mind; Lost in infinity we gaze, And leave this atom world behind. First Voice. Time is flying, death is near, Soon the turf will hold our head; How, O Soul! wilt thou appear With the book of judgment spread? Response. They who worship God are bought With a price above compare; He a spotless robe hath wrought Which his servants soon shall wear. First Voice. Is there hope beyond the grave? Tell! Oh! tell me, weak and vile! Launch'd on death's tempestuous wave, May I lift my head and smile? Response. There is Hope beyond the grave, Shout the truth thro' realms afar; Christ hath died, our souls to save, Christ, our bright and Morning Star. First Voice. Bounteous Father! here we own All thy goodness, all our days; But for the giftâthy Precious Son, Loud and loftier thanks we raise. Response. Salvation! May the glorious sound Extend from farthest sea to sea, Wherever man, O Lord! is found, May there an Altar rise to Thee! First Voice. Too long the world hath chain'd our heart, Now we gaze on prospects higher; Mammon! from our sight depart! Hence our souls to God aspire! Response. Whilst lingering in the vale of tears, Heaven's blazing thrones and portals shine; And Death, the King of Dread, appears A messenger of joy divine. First Voice. Let the spirit-breathing song Higher and still higher rise! Let Hosannas, loud and long, Shake the everlasting skies! Response. Death is now a conquer'd foe To all who long their Lord to see, And mild the summons, soft the blow, Which sets our captive spirits free. Chorus. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise to our Immanuel's name! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Let Sea, Earth, and Heaven proclaim! Edward, to Warren spake. âTrembling I hear! âMay we be wise, when folly hath such debt âOf awful recompence! Nay, we are fools! âAbject, unqualified, presumptuous fools! âOwning futurity, yet, all regards âAbout its nature, and the way to smile, âLike this good man in prospect of the grave, âCasting aside! Death, our stern enemy, âHaply, may be at hand, we unprepared, âOur armour off! Sailing on pleasure's tide, âBuried in dreams of false felicity, âAnd planning scenes remote, when in our ear, âBefore the sands of one fleet hour have run, âThe voice may sound, âPrepare to meet thy God!â âWith lives so frail, with such uncertainty âHanging on all belowâbefore usâDeath! âJudgment! And Immortality! O Earl! âGreat work is ours, for an eternal world âWell to provide! Thro' Christ our sacrifice, âFor the dear sake of who on Calvary died, It will afford pleasure to many to learn that such sentiments as those which are here ascribed to Edward, were expressed by Mr. Pitt, in his last moments. The following extract is more than ordinarily interesting from the intimate union which we have formed with that consummate statesman; whose eloquence has often charmed us, and whose name, for many years, was associated with almost all that we politically hoped or feared. What a moment between the triumphs of the greatest and their obsequies! When Mr. Pitt's physicians had intimated to the Bishop of Lincoln that âthe symptoms were unpromising, and that his situation was hazardous,â he thought it right to go to Mr. Pitt's bed-side, when he told him, âhe found it to be his duty to inform him, that his situation was considered as precarious, and requested his leave to read prayers to him, and to administer the Sacrament. Mr. Pitt looked earnestly at the Bishop for a few moments, and then, with perfect composure, turned his head to Sir Walter Farquhar, who stood on the other side of the bed, and slowly said,ââHow long do you think I have to live?â The physician answered, he could not say, and expressed a faint hope of his recovery. A half smile on Mr. Pitt's countenance shewed that he placed this language to its true account. In answer to the Bishop's request to pray with him, Mr. Pitt said,ââI fear I have, like too many other men, neglected prayer too much to have any ground for hope, that it can be efficacious on a death-bedâbut,â rising as he spoke, and clasping his hands with the utmost fervour and devotion,ââI throw myself entirelyâ (the last word being pronounced with a strong emphasis) âupon the mercy of God, through the merits of Christ!â The Bishop assured him, that the frame of his mind, at this awful moment, was exactly such as might, reasonably, be expected, to render prayer acceptable and useful. âThe Bishop then read prayers, and Mr. Pitt joined in them, with calm and humble piety. He repeatedly expressed, in the strongest manner, his sense of his own unworthiness to appear in the presence of God; disclaiming all ideas of merit, but with a conscience clear and undisturbed. He appealed to the Bishop's knowledge of the steadiness of his religious principles, and said, it had ever been his wish and endeavour to act rightly; and to fulfil his duty to God and to the world; but that he was very sensible of many errors and failures. He declared that he was perfectly resigned to the will of God; that he felt no enmity towards any one; but died in peace with all mankind; and expressed his hope, at once humble and confident, of eternal happiness through the intercession of his Redeemer.â Gifford's Life of Pitt. âOn which bless'd spot oft I have bowed and weptâ âGod grant us all our portion with the just.â Edward drew near. With gentle voice and mild, Thus he bespake. âWhom bear ye to the grave, âWith this your mournful and heart-moving song?â None answer'd him. Nearer he look'd. A tear Burst from his eyes! He sawâthe Prelate's name! The venerable Bishop whom he loved! Unutterable grief upon the King Press'd, when he trembling spake. âThe giddy whirl, âThe vortex of earth's purposes, pursued âFrom year to year, with untired vigilance, âMakes us forget that we were born to die! âAll is momentous but eternity! âDear, Blessed Saint! Thy death, may it be mine! âAs peaceful, in the hope of future joy!â As Edward paused, Warren drew near and spake. âThese Hostagesâhow shall they die, and when?â Dim thro' the glistening tear, Edward look'd up. He saw the Hostagesâwaiting their doom. Awhile the big thought labour'd in his mind, When, sighing, loud he cried. âPardon! Arise! âHaste to your homes! Your lives, your liberties, âFreely I grant, and as you go, to Heaven âPray earnest for the holy man, who here âPasses to his long home. He is your friend. âHe to my heart now speaks, nor speaks in vain.â BOOK XVI. SCENE, The English Fleet sailing to Mona. Upon the ocean's verge, David appears. He hails the ships just hastening on their course; The sail, half lifted, pauses: now on board The Cambrian stands. âWhat seek'st thou?â Talbot cried. Whilst Venables, suspicious, watch'd him well. He answer'd, âI am David, Cambria's Prince; âSworn hence, to Edward. In his cause I come. âBehold this signet! I unsheath the sword âTo conquer Mona. Mona was the ancient name for the Island of Anglesea; separated from North Wales, by a Channel, called the Waters of Menai. The Scotch and Welsh Antiquarians have respectively stated the Isle of Anglesea and the Isle of Man, to be the ancient Mona: but in opposition to Boetius, Humphry Lhwyd has substantiated the superior claim of Anglesea. The Isle of Man, (as well as Anglesea) was often called Mona, to which its name bears a close affinity. Hypothesis has been carried to a ludicrous extent in the opinion which some have entertained that the two Monas were the Fortunate Islands of the Ancients. Ramus, however, in his history of Norway, proceeds rather further in absurdity, by gravely advancing the sentiment, that the Scylla and Charybdis to which Ulysses was driven, lay âbetwixt Helseggen and Moshoe, on the coast of Norway.â No person writes on a subject, which, to himself at least, is not of importance, and if Ramus, in describing the wild rocks of Scandinavia, which then lay under his eye, magnified some of them into undue consequence, it is a prejudice not more natural than it is easy to pardon. Chieftains, we are friends.â Talbot replied, âDost thou approach our barks âTo follow or direct?â David exclaim'd, âTo lead: I follow none!â Cried Venables, (In friend or foe, ill brooking rivalry) âVain man! thou lead'st not here! We are old chiefs, âNot like the yielding osier, courteous âBending with every breeze. Rigid and tough, âThe oak which hath sustain'd a thousand storms âHeeds not the sapling's voice, nor his fierce frown. âPrince! If thy heart adore supremacy, âBack to thy mountains! Rule, if rule thou may'st, âThe torrents and the winds. Doubtless, thy sway, âThese will confess, ere Talbot's noble Earl, âAnd war-bred Venables.â David, awhile, Stood silent, checking passion's fiery surge. For a reply, he wist not what to frame, Writhing beneath the speech of contumely; Altho' one word, utter'd with spirit firm, Had shaken, to his reins, either bold chief. At length he cried, assuming humbler tone, âNeither to follow come I, nor direct, âBut to assist. Mona full well I know. âAt this my voice, her sons will shout aloud, âAnd we shall gain a bloodless victory.â Cried Talbot, âPoor thy promise! We disdain âThe bloodless victory. Slaughter and strifeâ âThese are the scenes we love, yet Cambrian Prince, âOur ships will hold thee. Spread the lingering sail!â Mona now rises on the distant view! âA fleet! A hostile fleet!â Thro' all her shore Sounded aloud. Ere eve (approaching fast) The truth was manifest! Now tumult reigns, Where late tranquillity sat like a child, And told the gaudy passing butterflies. Fathers and sons and husbands, to the beach Crowd, in their war array, or, on the hills, Pile the huge faggot! Thro' the dreary night, War sounds terrific. Mothers, in that hour, Felt, in their breasts, their hearts consume away. Wives and the trembling maiden wild appear, Whilst many an infant throng, speechless with dread, Look'd, with the ghastly crowd, toward the near hills, Darting their forked fires, far into Heaven, And casting round, a glare, red, ominous, That made night day. The early dawn appears, O'ercast with clouds, and now the welcome morn Increases momently, into whose breast, And purposes, ten thousand prying eyes Darted their doubtful gaze, straining to rest On clear reality. The sun is risen. Each latent doubt is vanish'd. England's fleet, Breaking the waves, white-foaming round their prow, Sails on terrific! âFlee!â the father cried. The husband and the brother shouted, âFlee!â And now with eager and o'erwhelming speed, The timid damsels, hand in hand, rush on To crag or cavern, 'mid the mountains bare. The children, from their homes, roughly thrust forth, Run, weeping, lost, and wild, calling in vain On friend or parent. Eager thro' the crowd Of infant fugitives, grasping her babe, The mother hastes, and as she passes by, To the forlorn and helpless innocents, (Who had no friend to guide their doubtful steps,) Cries, âFollow me! This way your mother fled! âHaste, my sweet babes!â Then, earnest passes on, Repeating the same words to others round, (Frantic and destitute, weeping and wild) As she her course pursued, horror at heart, Toward inaccessible and lofty hills. Upon the beach, the gallant islanders Wait the assault. Tho' less inured to war, And fewer than their foes, resolves are theirs, Befitting sons of valour. Nearer now The barks approach. A slender boat is seen Toiling to reach the shore! One man appears Standing erect, waving the olive branch. And nearer now he comes. His face is known. âPrince David!â sounds aloud. Closer he draws; When from his bark, to the still multitude, Thronging the shore, bending, he thus began. âFriends and brave countrymen long prized, I come âA peaceful messenger, you to invite âTo join my standard. David hath renounced âLlewellyn's sway, and, for himself, resolves âTo build an empire; a proud pinnacle, âTo raise to his own fame. Mona's brave sons âHave ever to my heart closely been bound, âAnd now I claim their services, to rear âFabric august, for David, for themselves âAll happiness. Know, to the English cause, âMine is united. Yonder view our friends, âSteadfast and faithful as the bow of heaven. âEdward, that noble Prince, promise hath dealt âMost solemn, from his boasted eminence âLlewellyn to pull down, and me to raise âTo my forefathers' throne. To hearts like yours âI need but shew myself, and name my cause, âTo call forth all your might and services.â A rumour and a buzz spread thro' the shore, As when outpouring from their mother hives, The young bees issue, and, in many a wheel, Hover around their home, loath to depart, Till, bolder grown, from their abode they turn, And in the wide world seek another rest. âOff! Traitor! Off!â Thunders along the strand. David in wonder stood, prepared again To name his purposes. A host of darts, That instant, from the shore, whizz'd all around. Doubt now is o'er. He turn'd, and to his men, Cried, âHaste away! The savage is let loose.â He sat, and, o'er his back, threw the broad shield, And whilst, like hail, the sounding darts descend, The boatmen ply the oar, and now have reach'd Talbot and Venables, roused to new wrath, Mingled with scorn, at David's boast o'erthrown. With dread resolves and vengeance in their eyes, The English haste toward Mona. Nearer now The barks approach. Fair Menai's tranquil tide Teems with the hostile ship, closing amain, And now the fight begins. Near to the shore, A thousand, headlong, plunge into the tide; Their shields uplifted, warding the thick darts From Mona launch'd. The brave repellers wade Far in the sea. A deathful strife is there. The stream, swift-passing, bears the slaughter'd crowd, On the blood-cover'd waves, out far away, Into the distant sea. Now, on the strand, The strife rekindles. Venables moves on, Behind him Talbot: David at the last.â Before he leap'd on land, upon the oar Leaning, he weptâto see his country's blood Staining the wave. Too late to hesitate, Boldly he sought the shore, and now the fight, Kindles remorseless. Fly! Poor Islanders! Your safety is in flight. Vain is your sword! Your valour, too, is vain! The flight begins, And carnage, with her blood-hounds, follows hard! The trumpet calls th' assailants. From a hill, Singly, a man advances to the foe. Upon his back a load he bearsâa harp. The Bard, with footstep firm, before him spears And pausing darts and death, still urges on, Dauntless his course. And now, sedate he stands, Before Earl Talbot and fierce Venables. (David was there, not foremost in the crowd.) Such firmness awed the Victors. Talbot cried. âAudacious Wanderer! And who art thou? âWhat seek'st thou? Say!â Calmly the Bard replied, âI have a song, O Chieftains, for your ear.â âSing on!â Cried Talbot. Lhyrarch struck the harp. Whence, O Warriors, clad in mail, Do you thus our land assail? Have we, wistless, done you wrong? Do you war with harp and song? Or have those, who are no more, Prostrate on the bloody shore, Call'd you from your homes afar, Thus to drive Destruction's car? We are few and peaceful here, And our hearths and homes are dear! Know, O Warriors! clad in mail, Where the stars thro' ether sail, There is One, who looks below, Greater than our mightiest foe!â There is One, whom you should fear, Wielding an Almighty spear! Should you traverse Mona more, Tracking thus your path with gore, List, O Warriors, clad in mail! Hear the threat, which cannot fail! He who bids the thunders rollâ He whose lightnings scare the soul, He, for Mona's children slain, Will blast you with his fierce disdain. You are men, tho' clad in mail; Shall the voice of mercy fail? Have you not on Albion's shore, Whom you prize and whom adore? Have you not in order fair, Father, mother, brother there?â Do you not, while far you roam, Oft turning, linger round your home, And homage pay, with bended knees, To Nature's tender charities? Do not your rosy offspring rise, Nightly to a father's eyes? By the love to these you bear, Mona's happy children spare! I see the tiger in your eye, Slay me! I disdain to fly! Did I talk, O Men! to you Of peaceful joys you never knew? With sweet words that move the tear, Father, Mother, Brother dear; Did I hope to make you feel, Whose blood is ice, whose hearts are steel? Hence! The milder word I scorn! Demons, hence, of darkness born! Lift once more the bloody spear! See my breast! O plunge it here! Infuriate, I will head the train The Ghosts of thousands you have slain! Swords of proof and glittering mail What, O Men, shall then avail? Our happiness shall be delay'd To meet you in the land of shade!â At the fierce contumelious speech, enraged Talbot his sword uprais'd. Him Venables Check'd in his wrath and cried. âEarl Talbot, hear! âThis man thou must not slay. To me confide, âI do conjure thee, by all sacred things, âTo me confide this slender management.â When Venables toward Lhyrarch turn'd and spake. âBard! thou art one of a fraternity, âWhom much I honor. Thou hast in this Isle, âSo fame declares, a harping brotherhood. âWhere are they? I would pay them homage meet.â âI tell thee not!â said Lhyrarch. âNay, O Bard!â Cried Venables, âMy motive none may doubt. âMore than the midnight pillow after toil, âSeek I to pay obeisance and regards âTo thy brave brethren, gifted, from on high, âWith the divine accomplishment of song. âDoubt not my plight, here is thy well-known Prince, âDavid the bold. He knows my faithfulness.â David advanced and spake. âIn me confide! âMotive unworthy, Venables disdains. âWe, for the sake of Bards, thee and thy friends âHeld sacred thro' all lands, haply may yield âHigh benefit, to Mona's conquer'd Isle.â Lhyrarch at death had smiled, yet at the word David thus spake, heart-cheering scenes upsprang. The Bards, who joy oft ministered, he hoped Now might provide security, and screen The wretched remnant from the storms of war. Thus he replied. âNever did Cambrian Prince, âHis trust betray, or deal in treachery. âHaste Chieftains! I the sacred haunts will shew.â Fatal had been the conflict of that morn. The sword had left its scabbard, and had done Its blackest deeds, whilst heaps of valiant slain, Commingled, in long lines, lay o'er the beach. The gallant Islanders, thinn'd and o'erpower'd, Fled unresisting, and the spoil around Lay at the spoiler's mercy. David spake, (While sorrow moved his heart, thus to behold, O'er the wide strand, the sanguine hue, and death In such heart-shaking forms) âEre we depart, âLet us prepare t' inter our fallen friends, âAnd, for our foes, delve the last resting place.â Talbot exclaim'd, indignant, âLet the dead, âO pitying Prince, bleach on the briny shore! âFar other thoughts, and other cares, are ours.â âAye,â answer'd Venables, âThe breeze of heaven âHath as much virtue as the soil of earth. âDeath holds his peace. The living we disdain. âInstant, O Bard, pass on!â (Thou man of steel! Thy bones shall whiten in the face of day, Whilst he who loves th' oblations of the wave, There shall his carcass rot!) Lhyrarch pass'd on. The blood-delighting Chiefs, with Cambria's Prince, Follow, attended by their victor host. Where Druids erst their mystic worship paid, Immured in forest solitudes, the Bards Held their resort. Contented here they dwelt, And, like some source munificent, sent forth Refreshing streams, watering a thousand lands, And as they stray'd, calling, from every heart, Praise and warm benedictions. Peaceful men, And wise as peaceful, whilst a busy world, With deep solicitude, feathers pursued, And airy phantoms; with unceasing toil, Straining against one tide, now, far away, Stemming another, all, for bubbles vain, Which, breath'd on, melt in air: they turn'd aside, And left a noisy and tumultuous sphere, Jarring and discord, to erect the song, And sweep the harp, and meditate, sedate, On Nature and her magic harmonies, And fortify their minds with thoughts of Heaven. They left the giddy plain, where folly reign'd, Where biting wrong and cruelty abode; Where murder prowl'd, in many a secret shape, And name disguised: and whilst degenerate man Squander'd, in ever-varying and dark ways, His brief existence, peaceful and remote, The purer Bard, fled from the tainted scene. Ambition and the thirst of sovereignty, Revenge and avarice, never in their hearts Made inroad fell. They mourn'd an erring world, And, purified by the high gift of song, Exalted to sublimer ends, and fill'd With influence of bless'd Spirits, they disdain'd All mortal aims, save how to tune the harp, And raise the voice, plunge into times unseen, And inspiration breathe from Heaven its source. âThe Bards were originally a constitutional appendage of the Druidical Hierarchy, which was divided into three classes, Priests, Philosophers, and Poets. At Llanidan in Anglesea, formerly inhabited by the Druidical conventual societies, we at this day find vestiges of Tre'r Dryw, the Arch Druid's mansion; and near it, of Tre'r Beirdd, the Hamlet of the Bards.ââJones's History of the Bards. The songs of Lhyrarch, the contemplant heart, And feeling, long had sooth'd. Far had they spread. At midnight's solemn hour, oft 'mid deep woods And forests, his inspiring harp was heard, Blending its soft notes, with the passing wind. Yea, when no form was seen, save Night's fair orb, And her attendant stars, the lonely Bard, From Cader-Idris, and the misty brow Of Carno, or Plinlimmon's stately head, Oft cheer'd the trav'ller, whilst from every cot, The village pour'd, and with extatic heart, Listen'd in silence, till the surly winds, Slow rising, howl'd, and gave an interlude For Admiration to speak out her praise. Such the wild wanderings of the tuneful Bard, That scarce a stream, whether with foaming pride, From clouded heights, plunging o'er precipice, Or gliding thro' the valley, or immured By rock or forest, but had heard the song And bless'd the harp of Lhyrarch. On the day, When Cancer throng'd the firmament with fire, To Mona's Isle, he, with the Bard remote, From utmost Cambria, press'd, and at this hour, He stood, 'mid all the smiling sons of song. Sad thoughts oppress'd their soul. The tidings came That England's warrior host crowded the seas, And press'd toward Mona's rock-encompass'd Isle. In every spirit consternation reign'd. Hosts to the forests sped, there to receive Blessings and consolations from the Bards, Ere they began the fight. In midnight shades, They reach'd the sacred wilderness. The remains still exist, in the Island of Anglesea, of the Great Grove, with the Tre'r Dryw, or Arch Druid's Mansion. Rowlands represents this chief residence of the Druids, and ulteriorly of the Bards, as having originally consisted of a large circle, comprising the Cirque, or place of judicature; the Carnedd, or place of sacrifice; and the Sacraria, or places of worship: the whole encompassed with a thick grove of stupendous oaks. The torch Told their dismay. Old Caradoc exclaim'dâ (The venerable Bard of ancient days) âGo, children! Pour upon the ear of Heaven, âThe oath to conquer, or, your precious blood âTo offer in your injured Country's cause! âMay he, whose name is Justice, give your arms âResistless strength, and fire your generous breasts, âWith fury in the fight, wrath that shall whelm âOur 'pall'd oppressors in destruction's wave.â Bless'd by their Patriarch, their Bard, their Friend, With mortal resolutions, forth they rush, (The midnight cloud still hovering in the air) Down to the beach, to conquer or to die. The strife is o'er! Impenetrable ends, All right, the Sovereign Ruler hath design'd, By the discomfiture, Mona sustain'd. Her sons are fallen! Fallen in no hour When red Ambition, with his flaming eye, Call'd up the tempest, and allur'd to death, His fierce upholders, but in virtue's cause! In the defence of all that man holds dear, These perish'd!âSons of innocence and peace. When to the battle, Mona's gallant bands Sped, fearless, in the true and earnest prayer For their success, each Bard his spirit raised: When, moved with passion, sudden Lhyrarch burst From the Druidic Circle and the Groves Sacred to poesy. âI will behold,â Eager, he cried, âthis conflict; I will see, â(Harping, from some high hill, inspiring strains,) âThis strife, when men, in freedom's holy cause, âScatter, like chaff, the hordes of tyranny.â He sat upon the mountain crag, alone, And play'd and paus'd, and paus'd and play'd again, Till silent was his harp, for he survey'd The tide of warfare beat, with vehemence, Against his country! He beheld, aghast, Cambria's brave sons fall, like the autumn leaf, Swept by the east-wind, till, at length, the few, The gleanings spared by Death, fled and resign'd Mona's fair isle to England's Ravagers! Uproused to maddening fury, from his seat Earnest he sprang, and down the mountain's side Rush'd like the bounding stag, his harp the while Murm'ring wild accents in his rapid flight. Before Earl Talbot and fierce Venables, And Cambria's Prince he stands. His harp he seized, And pour'd the fervent song.âHis life was spared, Whilst Venables talk'd of the reverence due To Bard and Harp, claiming the secret path That led to the sequester'd spot, where men, Inspired of Heaven, chanted the choral lay. âI lead you,â Lhyrarch cried. And now they draw Nigh to the forest, 'mid whose dark retreats, The Bards abode. They pass'd thro' avenues Of oaks, whose earlier days witness'd the rites Of hoary Druid, and, still fresh and green, They lift their stately heads and spread their limbs, And seem ordain'd to push their daring fronts Into new centuries; gazing around, E'en in the cold decrepitude of age, As mighty monarchs. Their stupendous arms Still parry with the blast, and tho' old time Hath, in their sides, burrow'd, yet still they knew That, as all forms which sported round, in youth, And manhood, ages past, have waned away, (Save the blue sky, and the abiding earth,) So, that the Forest Striplings, that now laugh Over their tottering Chiefs, will, like their Sires, Perish and be forgotten, ere the hour, Which sends the oaks of Mona to their grave. Each step they pass'd, ('neath th' o'erhanging boughs, Where silence reign'd, whilst scarce the light of Heaven Thro' the umbrageous gloom, forced its hard way) Calm'd down their heart. The pendent misletoe Once more appear'd with latent sanctity, And all around, breath'd a soul-chilling awe. The spirit seem'd oppress'd, with obscure thoughts, That sank into the heart, and made it feel, Or seem to feel, contact with hidden things, And beings, of no known material mould.â A greater stillness reigns! The gathering clouds Portend the storm! Lo! From ethereal depths, The lightnings burst, quenching th' unhallow'd sight! The thunder rattles! The fierce storm descends! The darkness thickens, and night, premature, Threatens the world! Amid th' imperial sounds, Rending the elements, each soul, subdued, Sinks into abject littleness, and feels Its high imaginations, with the dust, Blended and lost. Still, slow, they journey on, Silent, whilst the vex'd tempest spends itself. The storm abates. Now on the verge they stand Where erst the Druid dwelt, whose eye presumed To pierce futurity, not to reveal Jehovah's awful name, which none may speak Unblamed, but with abasement of the soul, Not to reveal God's future ways, his will, Thus leading to high knowledge; but to tell What vain man soon shall fill a vain man's throne, âThe magic of the Druids, or one part of it, seems to have remained amongst the Britons, even after their conversion to Christianity, and is called Taish in Scotland; which is a way of predicting by a sort of vision, which they call second sight. Vopiscus relates of the Emperor Dioclesian, that, when he was a private Soldier, in Gaul, on his removing thence, in reckoning with his hostess (who was a Druid Woman) she told him he was too penurious, and did not bear in him the noble soul of a soldier. On his reply that his pay was small, she, looking steadfastly on him, said that he need not be so sparing of his money, for after he should kill a boar, she confidently pronounced, he would be Emperor of Rome, which he took as a compliment from her, but seeing her serious in her affirmation, the words she spoke stuck to him, and he afterwards took much delight in hunting and killing of boars, often saying, when he saw many made emperors, and his own fortune not much mending, âI kill the boars, but it is others that eat the flesh.â Yet it happened that many years after one Arrius Aper, father-in-law of the Emperor Numerianus, grasping for the empire, traiterously slew him, for which fact being apprehended by the soldiers and brought before Dioclesian, who being then become a prime commander in the army, they left the traitor to his disposal, who asked his name, and being told that he was called Aper, i.e. a boar, without further pause, he sheathed his sword in his bowels, saying even this boar also to the rest,â which done, the soldiers, commending it as a quick extraordinary act of justice, without further deliberation saluted him by the name of Emperor.â Of dying myriads, who, erelong, shall die; Or meaner things, speaking of Hell beneath: Not so the Seer of old! Credential his Of Lofty Mission, worthy of a God, Embracing the whole race, disclosing truths Cheering the heart with doubt oppress'd no more, Poring on night, and which to all whose eyes Are blinded not of earth and evil ways, Throws wide the portals of futurity. Now in the midst they stand of that huge space, Long sought, encircled by the towering tree, Strew'd with tall stones, time-mouldering, some uprais'd To towering eminence, erect, some bent, By the age-lengthened storm; some, beam-like, thrown, With power miraculous, âIt excited astonishment how these mighty stones, some of them, twenty or thirty ton weight, could be carried in rude times, so great a way, and exalted to the height they are, either singly, standing in columns, or leaning upon supporters; but the wonder will vanish if we consider that wheel and pully engines were invented in the earliest ages of the world, together with the lever, with its illimitable power, combined with the Inclined Plane. In order to erect those prodigious monuments, we may suppose shat our ancestors chose mounts of firm and solid earth, or otherwise formed them where they were not, and which they used as Inclined Planes, flatted at the top, up the sides of which with great wooden levers, they might by little and little raise the hugest stones. When exalted to the level summit of the mount, they might place them in regular order, and then dig holes, of a given depth, under one end, into which the stones might be precipitated as into a case. When these stones were so sunk and well closed round with earth, and the tops of them appearing level with the top of the mount, on which the other flat stones lay, by placing these flat stones on the tops of the supporters, duly poised and fastened, and then by removing the earth, there would appear a Stonehenge or Cromlech.ââRowlands. from point to point Offering, beneath their vast unfolded arms, An ample sweep of sky, 'neath which, in years Long past, that border'd on the flood, removed From periods well-defined and chronicled, By watchful man, invoking Deity, With spotless vest, the Druid Priest pass'd on, And his attendant multitudes, to pay Their solemn but mistaken Rites, to Him Who fills the universe, and hath declared, (Needing no gaudy pomp and costly shew) That His abode, is in th' upright heart and pure. Savage of faith, his victim man, not else, In a benighted world, farthest from light. Except as it respects human sacrifices, the Druidical superstitions appear to have been less hostile to reason and morality than any of the systematic errors which prevailed in the same period, as, with other truths, they maintained the unity of God, a point of illumination in which they surpassed the more refined but polytheistic Greeks and Romans. This circumstance supports those who have asserted that the tribes and people which have descended, with little intermixture from the first ages, have preserved amongst them a greater portion of moral truth than other nations, less retired, although endued with the best talents; to whom all art and science were familiar, and who seemed to fail only in one thing, that it might be said, with conclusive forceââThe world by wisdom knew not God.â Here, in the centre of this hallow'd spot, With throbbing breast and sore anxiety, Lhyrarch's return the trembling Bards await. He hastensâwith the falchion steep'd with gore! As the huge host of fierce and warlike men, Came from the forest, lo! the Bards their harps Rais'd, and, one knee on earth, pour'd forth the song, Whenâsuch a concert burst into the sky, Of solemn notes and solemn harmony, As when Niagara, in all his pride, After a year of storms, o'er his huge crags Plunges impetuous, and, with warring winds Holds stately concord. Such the crash of sounds, That the rude bands made instantaneous pause, Whilst Venables and Talbot wish'd themselves, (In the misgivings of a heart unsound) Far off, from scenes of such unfathom'd power. Lhyrarch approach'd, with eager confidence, Toward th' assembled Bards. Thus he began. âBehold your friends!â Ere he could utter more, Old Caradoc, in his exuberant joy, To find that they were friends, whom foes he deem'd, Seized his near harp and toward the hostile bands, Hasten'd, with heart o'erflowing. His white beard, In graceful curls, hung pendent on his chest: His towering head was bare; his eye serene, In conscious dignity. His furrow'd brow Spake sense matured, and thought that dived profound Into mysterious things. His shoulder bore A flowing mantle. Round his loins, a cord Bound the loose robe, and toward the English chief, Sedate, he strode, all eyes beholding him. Full in the general gaze, he rais'd his harp, And those who scorn'd his song, listen'd perforce; No choice was theirs. Dumb, motionless they stand. Hail! Ye Sons of Valour, hail! Come and learn our mystic lore; Welcome to this forest pale, Where the Druid dwelt of yore. Mona's Bards, with harp and song, Here have found a peaceful home; And, 'mid concords, loud and long, Nightly watch the Planets roam. They have here a compact made, With the harp and woodland shade. Heroes! long to glory known, Late, in the tumultuous hour; Tho' not to idol terrors prone, We saw our tranquil zenith lower; Now, disdaining fears that were, We the peaceful olive wave;â In the moment of despair, We forgot that you were brave! Welcome to this forest pale! Sons of War and Valour, hail! Scarce had he ended, when fierce Venables Cried, with the eye of wrath. âBack to thy friends,â And now, with Talbot's Earl and Cambria's Prince Thoughtful, he ponders on the future path. Thus Venables beganâthe Flemish Knight! The man who fought for pay! in any cause Unsheath'd his sword; traversing hill and dale, Ocean and land, where warfare might be found, But chiefly plunder! Venables thus spake. (Even he who Cambria scourged, by rapine oft, And sword, made terrible, doubly by night, All still, when the soul-shaking sound aroseâ âThe Saxon! Lo! The Saxon!â Late, with heart, Obdurate, by th' accumulated crime, The brand he cast, remorseless, when the flames Burnt Lantredaff, that low and calm abode, (The Pilgrim's rest, the Traveller's welcome home,) Whilst all its inmates perish'd; in that hour, Unpitied, died amid the storm of death.) Thus Venables began. These Bards have wealth, âPoor as they seem, and, mark me, noble Chiefs! âThey are a race, plotting and virtueless. âAs foes, I hate them, but as Bards, thrice more. âSince, from my Nurse's arms, a sturdy Boy âI burst, and with the infant's lisping tongue, âCall'd for adventures, from my inmost heart, âI have abhorr'd the song, the harp, the bard. âThe midnight tiger's howl, the lion's roar, âFor me hath charms, but music, in all forms, âPlayer and instrument, I do regard âWith most substantial and intense disdain. âTo swell the host of their stupendous crimes, âThey are all cowards! Men who start from blood, âAs Maids from Ghost!âhaunting the hedge-row dark â(Made of lopped tree) with ghastly countenance, âAnd fearful arms, outstretch'd, eyeing with joy, âTh' unwary passenger, in musing mood, âWandering too near; when, from false slumbers roused âLike lightning flash, he aims the deadly blow, âUnerring and remorseless, which out-pours âUpon the victim, as he speechless stands, âSpite of all doctors, lotions, cataplasms, âCertain destruction! Most especial spite âBards do I bear, since, east of Offa's Dike, Offa, King of Mercia, cut a deep ditch or dike, from the Severn to the Dee, eighty miles long, as the boundary between Mercia and Cambria. A law was subsequently enacted that every Briton, found on the wrong side of the Dike, should have his right hand cut off. Camden traced the Dike for a long way, and it is distinguishable for a considerable space at the present time. The extensive ditch, on which the village of Woodensburge in Wiltshire stands, is supposed to have been dug by the Saxons, as a boundary between the Kingdoms of Mercia, and the West Saxons. âLong since, I one espied: I slit his ears, âAnd, thumbless, sent him to his proper soil. âHe turn'd and cried. âThou savage man! Thy life âJustice shall hurl to the impatient fiends!â âInstant, I slew him.âFor humanity âI have been singled long, yet at this hour, âSomething of harshness, needful, I propose. âWe must destroy these men! What say ye, Chiefs? âTheir hoards must be transferred to nobler hands. âYet, this the cause alone. They stir up strife. âThey tell the Cambrian of his ancestors, âAnd prompt his heart their deeds to emulate. âWhilst her Bards live, Cambria will never fall.â Talbot exclaim'd. âLike thee I hate the Bard, âAnd music is my scorn. Brave Venables, âI do applaud thy motion. They shall die! âOne Bard, you heard threat the Almighty Power âTo blast me. They shall perish one and all. âThis is the lucky hour, so have I heard, âWhen from all parts, the Minstrel Choir have throng'd âFrom utmost Cambria, here, in Mona's wilds, âO, babe-like emulations! to decide âWho best shall chant, and sweep the sounding string, âNot for their wealth are they ordain'd to death; âThat were unjust, but, that from earliest times, âThese Bards have been the germ, the centre-spot, âThe source and reservoir of daring deeds, âPrime movers of sedition and all ills. âBut for these Harpers, Cambria long ere this âHad been our slaves, and we had amply shared âTheir fair and most munificent campaigns, âTheir wealth, their mountains, and their liberties. âYea, they had all been prostrate, as the sod, âBut for the rousing, soul-seducing strains âOf these star-gazing Minstrels. Here combined âInto one focus, we will instant cry, âHavoc! and with destruction sweep the plain.â âStop!â David cried. âChieftains and reverenced men, âThe mists of error hover o'er your mind. âThese are not vile and abject as ye deem, âBut noble hearts. They nor sedition love, âNor noisy enterprise, but peace alone; âHeedless of all things but the harp and song. âSpare them, O Chiefs! Let not th' injurious thought âEnter your breasts! The specious viper false, âRend him away! Remember ye are Knights, âSoldiers of honor, sworn to valiant deeds. âNor would I wrong men high and eminent, âLike you, brave Nobles! by believing it âWithin the verge of possibilities âThat two succeeding moments you could think, âWith placid mien, upon a deed so foul.â Fierce Venables exclaim'd, âAnd who art thou?â âPrince David!â David cried. âI know it well,â Said Venables, abash'd at words so bold, Whilst David's cheek kindled, and his full eye, Beaming with wrath, told of the storm within. Cried Venables, âCambrian! no hour is this âFor private jars and conflicts, such as well âThou art prepared for. Art thou one of us? âMake our cause one. These harping men must die. âWhat say'st thou, Talbot? Speak! We wait thy words.â Talbot exclaim'd. âDavid! thy master here âView thou in me! Spite of thy earnest words âThese men shall fall. They are the secret springs, âKnow thou, O Prince! the cords, in midnight veil'd, âThat move rebellion. They, the grand cement âWhich binds with liberty the Cambrian's heart; âDeprived of this, England will wave, around, âHer banner proud, and after centuries âOf contest hard, call Cambria's land her own. âTo prove that thou hast one thy higher now âThat is enough, immoveable as earth, âInstant they all shall die. Death! Death! be theirs, âUnsparing and remorseless!â David's heart Beat hard within. Awhile he ceas'd to speak. His labouring breath told of the conflict hard. At length, with smother'd rage, thus he replied. âAct ye the Murderer's part! I stand alone! âI wash my hand of this foul massacre! âI enter, before Heaven, and in the sight âOf Spirits bless'd, of Demons and of Men, âOf the whole Earth, of Edward, England's Lord, âToo high of heart to countenance a deed, âAt which Hell lifts his voice, and ecstasy âSounds thro' his flaming vaults: I enter here âMy interdict! I my protest set down, âIn characters of blood! Spare them, O Chiefs! âLet Mercy plead! Let Pity's voice be heard! âWorshipp'd above. These are the mild of earth. âMen peaceable as sleeping Innocence. âTake not their lives! From discord far and strife, âThey hold communion with the mountain winds. âThey reverence not vain man's, but Nature's storms. âA compact with the mountain elements; âThis is their crime, but, calling up the blast âThat severs nations; whirling thro' the air âSedition's brand, and drinking at the fount âOf worldly elevations, this, till now, âIn the still teeming round of human crimes, âHath ne'er been charged on Bard, nor taken hold âOn harp and peaceful string. Yon company, âMy faith I pledge, my name, have never yet âBorne hostile sword. England no source of harm âNeed fear from Bard; and as for Wealth, O Chiefs! âTheir riches is their harp! Improvident âOf other treasures, they desire alone âTo move the feeling soul, and homage force âFrom the ecstatic heart to Poesy. âSpare them! My life be yours!â Fierce Venables, And Talbot, silent turn'd, scorning reply, To urge the hell-hound to his feast of gore. David exclaim'd aloud. O Chieftains, hear! âA small request is mine. Two valued men, âOf yonder company, earnest I ask! âO stay! One Bard alone, bending, I crave!â âGranted!â Cried Talbot. David said, âO spare, âThe aged Caradoc!âThese human eyes âMay not behold the sight. Awhile I turn âTo meditate and lift the earnest prayer âFor my poor Countrymen!âwhose injured souls âHeaven will receive! Now let the storm descend! âDrenching the woodland green, with gore and death!â He said and turn'd and wrung his trembling hands, Whilst the blood-reeking sword is drawn, and groans, And calls for mercy, fill the patient skies! BOOK XVII. SCENE, The Druids' Circle, in the Forests of Mona. The deed is done! Old Caradoc survives, A wretched man, ordained to see his friends, Kindred and brethren perish in one hour! The deed is done! The evening closes fast Upon a day, that, to the latest times, Mercy shall execrate, drooping her head. The Flemings, even the unhappy men Who did the deed, whose solemn compact left No option even with conscience, they themselves Have dug the grave, and dew'd it with their tearsâ The trench, long, wide and deep, that must intomb The Bards of Mona. Lo! The earth receives (Twilight around) the breathless sons of song. No voice is heard. Slowly upon the sod Their heads are placed, 'mid an unbroken pause, Save when the stifled sigh, forcing its way, Declared what anguish foes might feel for foes. At this heart-searching moment, 'mid their tent, Beneath the trees, Talbot and Venables Feasted, and with carousings laugh'd aloudâ O'er the exploit, where Satan had turn'd pale. Old Caradoc, upon the new-raised mound, Stood, whelmed in grief, the tear fast rolling down. A half extinguish'd torch one, near him, held, Waving its sullen glare, or else, all forms, Save the dark-sailing cloud, whether in Heaven, Or Earth beneath, slept and were motionless. Faint leaning on his harp, pendent, beside He view'd the scene, whilst his distracted mind Felt paralysed with anguish, and the flood Of heart-consuming woe. He moves his brow. The aged minstrel's eyes wake from a trance. He grasps his harp. He pours the fervent song. Gather fast, ye clouds of night! Let no star this deed behold! Be it blotted from the light! Be it but to Demons told! Thy honor'd Bards, O Cambria fair! Whose harps, so oft, have lull'd thy care, And taught thy sons, to pity prone, To make another's pang their own, O friends revered! O brethren dear! For you I shed the fervent tear! In the hour supreme of woe, Iron war hath laid you low!â While I am left, forlorn, alone, To heave the sigh and pour the groan! Masters of the sacred lyre! Spirits bathed in Fancy's fire! On daring pinion born to ride; Who only sojourn'd here awhile Sorrow's children to beguile With the songs to Heaven allied: When shall I again withdraw My jarring chord to learn of ye? When listen, lost in silent awe, To your towering harmony? In happier days, for ever gone! Which memory loves to linger on, 'Mid glittering hopes and sunny dreams, We haunted oft the dashing streams; Or, wilds remote from human eye, When lightnings flash'd athwart the sky, And thunders, with long-lengthen'd sound, In ghastly dread the fearful bound: Or the soul-enchanting mountains, Stately rivers, hallow'd fountains, Whilst Night, in panoply and prime, Marshall'd her starry hosts sublime: Hoary Fathers! Spirits pure! To Heaven's selectest treasures free, Earth your like shall never see, While the sun and moon endure! Meads and hills and torrents rude, Mourn your widow'd solitude! Who shall now your praises tell? They are dead who loved you well! O my Country! Cambria dear! In deep silence drop the tear, For never more at closing eve Shall thy ancient woods receive, Whilst radiance lingers in the sky, Thy loved, thy Bards' sweet melody! On the lonely willow-tree, Shall their drooping harps be found; And the winds that round them flee, Wake unheard the solemn sound! O that in Oblivion's tide, I could plunge, and wash away The memory of this evil day, And its deeds of darkness hide. Tho' the mortal groan hath past, Tho' is hush'd the raging blast, Tho' my brethren all are slain, Still, upon my burning brain, The image rests! the shrieks arise! The beaming spear affrights my eyes! The hand is raised! The knee is bent! And âMercy!â throngs the firmament. Why, in this vindictive hour, Was I spared a wretched end! To behold the bloody shower Thus on Mona's Bards descend. Sons of innocence and song! Shall o'er your fate no lofty spirits weep?â Cambria shall bewail you long When these weary eye-balls sleep! While succeeding ages roll, You shall move the feeling soul! To this spot, thus holy made, To this lone and peaceful shade, From a callous world and proud, Cambria's better sons shall crowd;â They, upon this mound, shall stand, And whilst their labouring hearts expand, They shall drop a tear for you And faultering cryââSweet Bards adieu!â Grey my lock, and dim my eye, On another state I gaze! The end of time with me is nigh, Yet, in these my parting days, Bitter is the cup of woe, Which I must drink before I go! The world to me is blank and dead, All its vagrant joys are fled; False and fleeting lights they gave, Brief as the sun-illumined wave. Confusion thickens! mists abound! Forms mysterious gather round! Like the stars that seem to fly, When the clouds are sailing by, All things swim before my sight! Dreams of dread! and visions bright! O what lawless revels reign In my strain'd and labouring brain! I see no home beneath the sky! I hear no harp's sweet minstrelsy! I view no Bard a brother made, All beneath the turf are laid!â I am left, and left alone, To heave the sigh and pour the groan! Hence, of happiness bereaved, Still pursuing, still deceived!â From the storms that round me rave, There is a refuge in the grave! Ah! a Foe, for mortal fray, Starts forth, in terrible array! All must die! Our earthly span Oppress'd with ample grief is found; But tenfold wretched is the man Who dies with none but Strangers round. No friend to bid his anguish cease, When terrors rise, to whisper peace; To hang upon his parting breath, And smooth the rugged road to death: Whose head is laid, where all must lie, Without a tear, without a sigh. Pity near, when we complain, Sorrow loses half its pain; The feeling heart is not for me, Mine is lonely misery! They who would have rush'd to share All my joy, and all my care, Their memory blessings rest upon! To their long, long home are gone! Hope farewell! Thine end I view! Pleasure! take my last adieu! I, where tempests rave around, In a lonely bark am bound: From care to care, with none to save, Toss'd like a locust on the wave. As fixed as Repose, and as earnest as Fear, I will gaze at the sky, 'till the planets appear; As passive my spirit, as dreary and chill As the cloud which December drives whither he will. O thou precious tomb below, Hast thou no room for a Child of Woe? One poor and forsaken, one abject and old, The last of his race, over whom blows cold The wind of adversityâpitiless blast! While no mantle he has round his bare limbs to cast. Thy arms open wide, let me spring from the day, And rest my tired head on thy pillow of clay. What Demons are those? I behold them in air, The sword steeped in blood, the dyed falchion is there! With a horrible scowl, and an eye like a star, Fierce, baneful, malignant, they watch me from far. O what are my crimes that such Beings should dance In Old Caradoc's sight, shaking thus the red lance? They approach me! A shelter! Thou feverish brain, Thy throbbings allay!âI am tranquil again. The past recedes, new prospects shine; Farewell, O Earth! O Harp divine! Soon must I attune my ear To other cadence soft and clear, To songs that suit the upper sky, To strains of Immortality! God of majesty and might, Let thy winged lightning fly! Let thy thunder-bolts alight, On the monster Chieftains nigh! At this hour of tears and sighs, Mark! their horrid laughters rise! Scorn'd of every heart and clime, May they wither in their prime! Hope, the balm of human care, May they barter for despair! May thy mercy, Judge of all! Never to their souls extend, But confusion on them fall! And perdition, without end! Anguish, like a flaming dart, Deeper, let it pierce their heart! And when on life's tempestuous brink, Whilst her wormwood dregs they drink, Let them pass the torrent wild, Not like virtue's peaceful child,â By their own uplifted hand, May they perish from the land! Or, Justice, with remorseless fang Tear them from these happy skies, And the still-increasing pang Be their worm that never dies! Oh! I err! The storm within, My heart hath hurried on to sin!â This sudden tumult in my vein Hath dragg'd me back to earth again. Anger! Child of Hell, away! I will look to Heaven and say, God of mercy! o'er the past, Thy forgiving mantle cast!â Now let me to the forests flyâ There to sorrowâthere to die! He ceas'd; yet ere he left the hallow'd spot, One lingering look he cast, o'er the dear bed, Whereon his brethren lay. Speechless he views; His spirit labouring with despair; his hand, Now rais'd, and his fix'd eye, straining toward Heaven. While thus he stood, all eyes beholding him, The moon o'er lofty trees, faintly shines forth; The breeze of night subsides, and the full soul Of bold-eyed warriors, long unused to tears, Indulges ample grief, and sympathy Feels with the scene around. Amid the pause, So holy, and that reach'd the inmost heart, Old Caradocâonce more serene and mild, Slow from the mound descends, and passes on, Lonely, thro' forest trees, secret and dark, Smiting his breast, to his unknown abode. What man is thatâwho, on the stony beach, Wanders alone? By Menai's flood he stands, With folded arms. Now, on the mighty deep, Silent he gazes, now, with hurried step, And hand uplifted, paces a brief way, Then stands again! Rash and distracted man! David is there! A boat is near the strand, Moor'd to a rock. He seeks it, and forth sails, Cross Menai's tide, toward Cambria's craggy shore. Now to the midst he came. The gushing wave, Crossing his prow, oppress'd him whilst his heart, Roused to conviction of enormous crime, Dissolved within him! Horror fill'd his soul! He slacks the sail. The rudder, he swings round, Rude, from his grasp, and, on the slender plank, Sinks like a load of lead. What thoughts were thine, What anguish, wretched Prince! When o'er the past Thou dartedst a sad glance, felt conscience strike Against thy breast, like the fierce lightning flash, Scathing thy spirit! Past, and present, too, And future, all is dark and mists obtuse. The wave was near. He rises from his seat, He pauses on the waters gliding on, And thinks, how sweet a thing it wereâto die! To end his cares! To smother his last groan, And be forgotten! Ah! He starts! He thinks Upon a future worldâwhere permanence Of joy or sorrow waits, anguish untold, Or bliss ineffable. Again, his mind, (Soften'd by genial current from the heart) Ponders upon his babes! Upon a wife That loved him even to doatingâall undone! Wreck'd, and, like lumber, cast upon the world. Once more his soul revolves, forced to the task, On his own fame, with mildew and with blast, Eternal, cover'd. In that searching hour, He saw his country, once pre-eminent In his affections, casting him aside, Scornful, against whose breast, he thrust his spear. O'erwhelm'd with woe, downward again he sinks! Despair and horror hurried from his breast, All thoughts, all cares, all fond solicitudes, For mortal things, and in the drifting boat, Senseless, he glides upon the smooth green sea! Edwall, the young, the brave, when the news came, That David had renounced Llewellyn's cause, His force with Edward join'd, and pledg'd himself Against his countryâNero-like, upraised The murderous sword, with a remorseless heart, To stab the breast that nurs'd him, yea disdain'd Each partial feelingâto his house, his home, Friend, kindred, all that savage man adores; Edwall, the young, the brave, vow'd to explore, Both sea and earth, 'till his upbraiding eyes Lighted on one, whom he might yet reclaim, And drag, indignant, from perdition's gulf. Far were his wanderings. Ever where he came, He ask'd for David, David his lost friendâ The traitor, David. Now oppress'd with care, Disconsolate and hopeless, Edwall stood, Amid a lonely and wild forest shade, His course unknown, and buried in deep thought. Plain things and obvious, before his gaze Arose unnoticed, 'till, from dreams he woke, Roused by the beauties of the circling scene. Beside, a rock appeared, with here and there, Amid some high recess, a starting tree, With ivies of wild form. The sable Birds, Unknown to change, tenants perpetual, In many a graceful wheel, breasting the breeze, Sailed slow around; or now, with sudden scream, Burst from their airy perch, as it might seem, From their strait course and nerve impetuous, Resolved t' explore new scenes, and know what lands The wide world call'd its own; then, of their homes, Thinking, and, with impassion'd speed, once more Returning to their restâwhere they display, Long lines of black upon the time-worn crags; Save by themselves, spots only visited, As ages roll along, by sun and shower. Trees of stupendous frame veil'd half the sky, Whilst a rough mountain brook, choked with grey stones, Babbling roll'd on, (lost in the dell beneath) With speed that dallies not with trifling thingsâ The tall flag waving, or the moss-grown oak, (Long undermined, the pride of ages past, Thrown in fantastic shape across the stream) But with augmented ardour rolls along, Impatient of its distant resting-place. Even like the shepherd-boy, his fold secure, (His shaggy, lank, half-famish'd dog behind) Amid the trackless down in wintry hour, Urging his way, when bleak the tempest roars, And evening closes fast, and snows descend, And the wide plain is dreary, desolate,â Whilst he, head foremost, clothed in white appears The ponderous mist, and eddying sleet around: He stops not to admire the spotless robe, Nature investing, or the silver flakes, With all their fairy lines of lovelinessâ Such thoughts escape the spirit, cold and sad, He thinks upon his home and hurries on. It was an hour of choicest influence, Where all around breath'd fragrance to the soul. In admiration wrapt, nor without thoughts, (Mingled with praise,) of Him who made it all, Edwall beheld. In silence as he stood, He heard a voice, a solitary sound, A warbling hymn, angelic symphony, Come from the rock at hand. Within his heart Rapture abodeâto think that there was oneâ One being, with himself, such glorious sights To witness and the adoring anthem raise. Not less it cheer'd his heart, than doth the path, In unexpected moment, the bare line, (Made by the oft-returning foot of man) Amid the fields, to him who roams afar, Unknowing where, yet, in his spirit, holds Feelings that link him to his kind, and loves Still the sweet footstep of Humanity. Intent he look'd. Amid the thickest green, Up 'mong the heights, at length he marked a cave, And at its mouth with ivies matted round, An aged hermit, with sweet melody, Pouring his lonely song. Whilst Eve 'gan crowd, In th' western sky, her floods of brilliancy, Clear flows the strain. On the rough stone I sit, whilst the evening draws nigh, And the Zephyrs their fragrance luxurious send; No motion I see, but the birds in the sky And the lofty trees waving, beneath where they lie, Stretch'd far as the sight can extend. Tho' my sorrows are great, yet my spirit is calm, No more to the winds, I, my anguish will tell; The Breeze playing round to my soul breathes a balm, Whilst Creation all joins in an audible psalm, And my heart the glad anthem shall swell. A shelter I have from the wind and the rain, While the fare of the Hermit is still my delight; I may drink of yon rivulet, again and again, And when I have done with this body of pain, I shall dwell with the Angels in Light. O why should I part with my noblest desire! Why barter the Crown which awaits me above! That hope, like an anchor, which bids me aspire, To join in yon world the Celestial Choir Who sing of Redemption and Love! To all 'neath the stars I shall soon bid adieu, The clouds gather fast, my departure is near; Then my hopes and my fears, all I dread or pursue, Like the waves of the ocean will fade from my view, And Eternity only appear! Men heed not their Maker, his voice from on high, May they wake, ere too late, from their perilous dream! But when I remember, how soon I must die, That my Life sails on, like the cloud of the sky, My time I must strive to redeem. I have heard of glad tidings, far better than they, All brief, which the Sons of Prosperity prize; So hither I come to meet Heaven half way, With my own heart to commune, to praise and to pray, And my pinion to plume for the skies. The burdens of earth I will joyfully bear, Afflictions are monitors sent to restore; A Pilgrim I am, as my Forefathers were, My portion is sorrow, my birth-right is care, But the conflict will shortly be o'er. These woods, where I dwell, can instruction supply, From the grave of the winter rejoicing they rise; Whilst the birds, on their wing, tell me how I should fly To lay hold on the prize, which awaits in the sky For the Steward who is faithful and wise. So here will I pour, still at morning and eve, The song of the heart to the Father of Love; I will cease, at my sorrows, all fleeting, to grieve, For soon, with the Just, will my spirit receive A Part, in the Mansions Above. Then let the winds roar, thro' the cloud-darken'd air, As onward I haste from these regions of night; The road may be rough, but the prospect is fair, And the end of my journey, when I arrive there, Will be permanent calm and delight. He ceased, when Edwall, mounting with hard toil, Approach'd the cave. Before his crucifix, Silent, the Hermit knelt. Edwall, awhile, Paused, doubting if it were not leagued with sin, To call the good man's spirit back to earth. As thus he stood, Edwall the Hermit saw. Slowly he rose, and with the influence Of Heaven upon his countenance, approach'd, And thus began. âWelcome to this my cave! âSuch fare as I possess, Warrior, is thine.â Edwall replied. âFather! thy song I heard. âIt hath aroused strange feelings in my mind. âHearing thy words, the world, from this my sight, âReceded, and all things appeared a blankâ âSave, how to live that I might safely die. âThou hast sustain'd, no doubt, in this bad world âThy share of sorrow. If no violence, âIt do thy heart, tell me the circumstance âWhich forced thee from mankind, to scenes like these.â The Hermit bow'd. Thus he began. âMy Son! âI like thy mild address, and even will name, âWhat once within my soul woke agony âTo think of, in the solitary hour. âIts pungency is past. Hear me, my Son! âThere was a pleasant convent in a vale, âWhere pious men, far from a noisy world, âDwelt, and found happiness. This was my home. âIts inmates had one heart; one faith; one aimâ âGlory to God. His praises morn and eve, âDuly we chanted, and a Paradise âIt seem'd to be, a little heaven on earth, âA sanctified and angel residence. âRiches we hadâenough, with gratitude, âTo fill the heart. What could we covet more âThan raiment, and such food as He possess'd âWho hunger knew; who, o'er the mountain, roam'd âOft thro' the night, in meditation lost, âPleading for Sinners; strengthening thus his soul âFor opening scenes, that he might cry, at last, âTriumphant, âIt is finished!â and thus leave âThe World he saved, tho', in his sojourn here, âHe had no place, where he might lay his head! âIn th' midnight hour, each from his pallet starts! âA noise is heard without! The Saxon there âBreath'd threatnings! Trusting in th' Almighty's arm, âCalmly, I sought the foe. Fierce Venables, â(That was the man, the terror of our land) âAsk'd of our wealth. I answered, âPoverty âHad long in Lantredaff held her abode.â ââThe Brand!â aloud he cried. The brand was cast! âThe reeds upon our dwelling stream with fire. âMy Brethren fear'd the sword. They welcome gave âEven to the flames which sent them to their rest! âWhen now the fire prevail'd, and I had hoped âThe pang was past; even in that moment burst âFrom out the flames such gusts of agony, âSuch fearful shrieks, such symbols of despair, âHeart-shaking, that even Saxon Men look'd on, âGhastly and petrified. It dies away. âThe storm is hush'd. The crackling flame is heard âUnbroken. Now we pause, waiting to hear âThe last groan of the dying. Ah! In vain! âEach shook his head, and feebly cried âTis o'er!â âAll perished utterly. In that dread hour âFriends, Brethren, Fathers, took their flight, and left âMe, aged, tottering 'neath the weight of years, âGrey-headed, to find out a quiet spot, âWhere I might sit alone, and weep, and die! âThis solitude I found, at length, this cave. âMy dwelling it shall be, till I, my head âGently lay down in death; and I will sing âEach morning, and each evening, the same song âThou heardest. It hath power to lull my heart. âFull Faith in Heaven is the true antidote âFor sorrows such as mine. It lifts my soul âAbove earth's cares, and cheers me with that world âWhere the storm-beaten Traveller finds repose.â Edwall, the tear upon his cheek, replied. âFather! in other hour, and I would pour âAll solace to thy heart. Awhile, tho' hard, âI must forget even thee, for now the Foe âTraverses Cambria. With our noble Prince âI wage the war. Little I dreamt, that one âLike thee, allied to the Celestials, âHere found a dwelling. Cheering to the heart âIt is to meet some unknown traveller, âBound to a better worldâto feel the truth, âThat, far beyond the precincts where we dwell, âOur little rounds, our atoms magnified, âGoodness prevails, luxuriant, excellence, âWith virtue rare, held by the thread of life âAlone, from mounting to its native skies. âDoubtless in that dread hour, approaching fast, âWhen all shall rise to judgment, multitudes âWho here no eye attracted, who pursued âThe way of holiness, no trump before, âTheir witness God, tho' little known of man, âObscure, despised, will hear the voice, âWell done!â âAnd shine like stars, in th' heavenly firmament, âFor ever and for ever!âYet again âI hope to meet thee, haply here below, âIf not, in th' world of blessedness above. âFather! awhile farewell! Now must I find âDavid, our Prince. He hath a traitor proved. âOh! I do wrong him! No! No traitor he! âHe must be faithful!â Rising from his seat, With earnest aspect, thus the Hermit spake. âWarrior! A roving man, at morning hour, âLate, call'd me from my prayers, to ask what road âLed to our Prince. Ere I could answer him, âHe cried, âI have a piteous tale, most sad, âTo bear Llewellyn. David, our rash Prince, âHath join'd the Saxons! From the green-wood shade, âOut on yon shore, I watch'd him hoist his sail, âAnd with a murderous band toward Mona speed.â Edwall afflicted stood. Conviction now Flash'd on his mind. He would have said, tho' faint, âOld Man, adieu!â Vainly he utterance sought. He smote his breast, and sighing turn'd away. Whether the course of things, chance, accident, Which sometimes draws to one converging point Events unlook'd for; or, that Higher Powers, Supreme of all; or Angel Ministers, With delegated sway, roam thro' the earth, And the ordained things bring into light, By influence, subtile, as ethereal air, (Save by one star amid the dark profound,) Who shall affirm? but Edwall, at the hour, While Cambria's traitor Prince from Mona sailed, Wander'd on Menai's beach. He saw a boat Far out, amid the tide. He mark'd a man, Now rising up; now stretch'd, in sleeping form; Now, pondering, with clasp'd hand, upon the wave, As tho' he waited for some fresh resolve Invoked with half the heart, deferr'd, not scorn'd, To plunge into the tide and there to die. Near to the Cambrian shore the boat now drew, Distant from where he watch'd it. In the play Of sportive fancy, to himself he cried, âWhat if that man were David; my lost friend!â His sober mind banish'd a thought so wild, âYet,â Edwall cried, âYon stranger I will seek. âHaply, some rumour may have reach'd his ear âOf David. Friend or foe, I seek him out.â With earnest speed, along the smooth white beach, Edwall now pass'd. His footstep regular, Far back, was manifest, denting the sandâ Refuse of rocks no more, and clifts august, Once barrier to the ocean, now dissolved By wind and beating surge, (haply in years Before the flood) whilst, of their eminence, Dust but remains!âSo will the things of earth, The monuments of proudest industry, The forms, upon whose brow, Stability Rested her foot, and laugh'd amid the storm, Fall, in their destin'd hour, and, like the sand, Circling the ocean, from the passing foot Impress receive, toss'd on the gentlest wind. Yea, all Earth's Family shall wane and waste Like these austere, these adamantine crags, Pre-eminent, which in their potency, Once the fierce Main, defied, gazing sedate, On the white multitude of armed waves, That at their base, with each returning tide, Fresh armed for war, spent their impetuous rage. Solemn decree, and irreversible!â Earth, fruitful in expedients, here beholds Her inefficient might. No power hath she To weave, secure, th' impenetrable web;â No drug, or rare elixir, blazon'd forth, The purchase of long centuries of toil, Now, all we want, the antidote for Death; Celestial armour none, to ward the fate, Which sweeps the Generations of Mankind, Into forgetfulness!âRank follows rank To th' Tomb's appointed precincts! to the Vale, Upon whose clod, the mightiest rest themselves. Nor in unguarded hour, less vigilant, Doth our Great Foe ere intermit his march, Eternal as the round of day and night, Onward he goes, 'neath cypress canopy, With all his ministers, a haggard train, Bearing their victims to sepulchral gloom, Their last abode, 'till th' Heavens be no more!â Ah, what are all the transitory points Of man's desire!âFame, and precedency Most scrupulous, required by worm of worm! Which rouse, thro' earth, th' unceasing hurricane, Inflame the eye and agitate the heart, Conferring on the moment, what alone, Is due, to ages, to eternity! Thy loftiest sons, O Earth! the great, the vain, Men bloated with ambition, treading down All obstacles which cross their purposes, With an herculean strength, stop not to think How soon their race must terminate,âto view Their mansion with the worms,âthe narrow spot, Sole residue of all their wide domains, Soon to receive them. Startling to their ear Who would extend their domination proud, Beyond the span of time, still look beneath, And be, not less than Monarchs in the Grave, On the same level all erelong will lie! The lonely Prisoners, weeping o'er their chains, And shrinking from the blast, thro' matted grate Forcing bleak way and whistling shrill around, With those who bask beneath their gorgeous thrones, World-shaking Potentates! after brief hour Of storm or sunshine, must renounce their state, Feel the heart cankerworm, and to the earth, At length, descend; leaving no trace behind; Like the proud billow, that one moment lifts His head in scorn, and then for ever flies! Thrice bless'd are they who have a better Home, More pure, more permanent, and who can call Their God their Father, and their Judge their Friend! While thus, with earnest step, Edwall pass'd on, He mark'd the boat, rest on the neighbouring beach. As the keel grated o'er the yellow sand, The motion, into David's heart, convey'd Sudden distraction. Waking from a dream, He knew, that now, on Cambria's shore he stood. Congeal'd and dead, his heart within him sank. Life scarce remain'd. His elbows on his knee Rested, and, in his open palms, his face, Pallid, seeks refuge. Edwall toward him came, With cautious step, gazing with earnestness, On the regardless man: now on this side, Again on that. â'Tis he!â Aloud he cried. David look'd up as from a sudden trance. At length, his eye-balls from their socket strained, Edwall he saw! His cheek, with crimson dyed, Once more seeks refuge in his shrouding hands, The gentle breeze, rustling the green sedge near, Distinct was heard. Edwall approach'd and said. âDavid! my friend!â David, as statue still, Heeded him not. Edwall still nearer came, âMy Friend!â he said, âWhence lonely and thus sad.â Three waves along the beach roll'd up and down, Ere David moved, when, with a languid eye, That glanc'd, not look'd, at Edwall pausing near, He raised his head, and from the full-charged breast, Pour'd the deep sigh. âLeave me with night,â he said. âHere let me perish, silent and alone!â Edwall exclaim'd, âMy friend! art thou not such? âI will not leave thee! Tho' the sun retires; âTho' ocean here retreats; tho' day-light flies, âI will be faithful!â David, on his armâ On Edwall's arm, once his firm resting place, Lean'd, but he spake not, whilst the evening gale Came hollow from the wave. At length he cried, In trembling tone, âI have deserved thy hate! âThy execration! Thy devoutest scorn! âI have my brother wrong'd; my country pierced; âMy fame consumed! Now what remains for me, âBut death and all that makes death terrible! âLeave me! E'en thou art monstrous to my sight!â âI will not leave thee, David! Still my friend,â Edwall replied, âtho' it, alas, is trueâ âThou hast Llewellyn wrong'd, thy country pierc'd, âThy fame consumed.âCease that deep-rending sigh! âMy brother, weep not! Tho' my spirit vow'd, âWhene'er I met thee, with a flood of wrath, âAnd words of biting taunt, to deluge thee; âYet thy compunction, and the ampleness âOf thy remorse and self-accusing spirit, âHave melted my stout heart down to a babe's. âMy anger is past by; my love remains. âForget the past! Think what may yet be done. âTho' long to reason lost, yet thou art now, âA Patriot, roused from transient lethargy. âUtter despair, banish from this thy breast! âThy country still remains, and thy fair fame, âMay bud afresh and with new verdure soar âFar into heaven. Take courage. Yet pursue, âDauntless, the road to well-earn'd eminence.â David replied. âCan one, so lost, aspire âTo aught refreshing to the noble mind? âMy moment is gone by. The glittering scene âWhich once illumed my fancy, hath expired âIn ten-fold night, and nothing now remains âBut shame eternal! I suspect my state! âMy memory! Some spirit not my own, âSeems to have made my soul its vehicle âFor deeds, at which my better part recoils. âEdwall! And didst thou dare to speak of fame, âBudding afresh!âWith permanence of scorn, âLlewellyn thinks of David and his crimes. âO Edwall! I have split upon a rock, âThat hath proved death to thousands. I have lean'd âAgainst ambition, deeming him my friend, âAnd he a secret dagger hath sent forth âInto my vitals! I am fool'd at last! âI am undone, most irretrievably. âTell me, and truly! Was Llewellyn roused, âUp to tempestuous rage, when first he heard âOf my defection? or with solemn brow, âAnd cautious words did he regard my crime? âAll placidness!â Spake Edwall. âFree of wrath. âNot e'en a transient ray illumed his eye. âHe knew thee rash, and that aspiring thoughts âHad madden'd thee, yet, when the news arrived, âThat thou hadst join'd with Edward, our sworn foe, âWith countenance that told his feeling heart, âHe sigh'd and said, âmy Brother!â David spake. âThen have I naught to hope. Like my own plans, âImmoveable as earth, are his resolves âForm'd in the secret regions of the heart. â'Tis not the storm which penetrates! Enough! âA quick resolve, kin to despair and death, âNow rushes thro' my spirit. Lead me on! âE'en to his presence! Let a brother's sword, âWith righteous wrath, send me to gaping Hell! âI have deserved it! I will meet the blow, âUnshrinking, uncomplaining, unappall'd!â Edwall replied. âMost brave is this thy path. âLlewellyn's heart is not inflexible. âBelieve me, earliest and heart-honor'd friend! âHe is as ready to swear amity, âThy pardon grant, burying the past in night, âAs is the sun to shine, when the dark cloud, âRetires and gives Heaven's azure to our sight. âBehind yon grassy brow, late I beheld âA neat-herd's cot. If thou Llewellyn doubt, âAnd seem thee meet, thither with me repair. âMake that thy dwelling, till, to Aber's pile, âOr Conway, or where'er the occasion lead, âI hasten and inform our noble Prince, âThat thou art found; and smooth, no rugged road, âDavid, to favour.â David cried, âmy head âSwims with strange mists. Thy words do cheer my heart âWith vision, indistinct, of future good, âYet, Edwall, know! Not to the humble cot âDavid must haste, butâto Llewellyn's self! âI must redeem the pastâlose not an hour! âO Edwall, my best friend! Balm of my life, âHow shall I thank thee! Now imperious calls âHang on each moment, but the hours will come âWhen I may prove my gratitudeâtho' great, âNaught to the stable friendship thou hast shewn. âWe will speed on. Should Cambria's Prince confess, â(Whom in the midst of words of scorn and hate, âI still did love; I had no power to break âThe bond of nature,) should he still confess âKindred with David, if my country still âShould own a son so vile, what scenes may rise.â âO Edwall! What grand spectacle, august, âYet may appearâwhat tablet, where a heart, âContrite, may write its deathless penitence! âWe hasten! Time is short! Our work is great!â To meet Llewellyn, with deep-pondering brow, David and Edwall straight their course pursue. BOOK XVIII. SCENE, Mona; Cambria; Conway Castle. David and Edwall proceeding to meet Llewellyn. The tidings fly, âDavid hath traitor proved.â Earl Talbot, in amaze and maddening rage, Shouts, âSeymour! Hither haste! Stanley, attend! âUnsheath your mortal swords! Seize some near barks! âArrest the fugitive! My happiness âWere sovereign, in his heart to plunge my spear.â The English Knights speed to the ocean verge. They spy, 'mid Menai's waters, a lone boat, And, sailing there, a solitary man. âBehold him!â Stanley cried. Their barks unmoor'd, Forward they haste. Now had the distant boat Reach'd Cambria's shore. Two men in converse stand. They leave it, and sedate their way pursue. Seymour to Stanley cried. âHis path we mark. âWe may outstrip him in his tardy course. âOn Cambria's onward shore we will alight, âAnd, haply, should his steps thither be found, âWe yet may meet this traitor Prince, and vile, âAnd bear him to his ignominious fate.â Before the favoring breeze, fast sail the Knights. Cried Stanley âAt this hour, (with my true band, âBeyond yon rock, out stretching 'mid the waves,) âI will explore the beach. Should this my sword âFail to arrest the Traitor; thou, before, âWilt make him a sure mark.â âSpeed!â Seymour cried. Stanley and his small band now reach the shore. One hastens to a friendly eminence; Back he returns, rejoicing. Thus he spake. âI see the fugitive! Hither he wends, âWith one, at hand, discoursing earnestly.â Stanley, with joy elate, cries, âIn yon brake, âCrouching, we pause, till, at the signal shout, âWe issue, and our prey resistless seize.â On with calm pace, David and Edwall come, Undoubting harm, till, with a sudden shout From the green leaves, the hostile band out-pour! Roused from discourse, David and Edwall spy Their foes approaching, and with swords quick drawn, Await the strife of men. Eager they haste, Many and fierce. The Cambrians see how vain, Hardiest resistance, and (no word between) Provide alone for safety in their flight. Hard is the chase! Young Edwall, like the hound, Fleet, vehement, surpasses nimblest step; When, turning backward glance, his friend he spies, Toiling and faint behind. Sudden he stops; Then striding with firm step up to the foe, With arms infolded, and with beaver down, Exclaims, âWhom seek you?â âDavid!â Loud they spake. âBehold him, in myself, Edwall replied. âI yield! Your toil is o'er!â Fierce uproar reigns. Edwall they seize, till, with impetuous speed, Stanley advances. âBear him to the shore!â Eager, he cried. And now they lead away The man, who, to his life, preferr'd his friend. Again they reach the strand. Ah! woe was there And consternation! The receding tide, Had left the weighty bark, far on the strand, And vain their strength to launch it to the wave. Cried Stanley, âTill the favoring surge return, âDavid shall hear th' accusing voice. Advance, âO traitor Prince!â Edwall approaches firm. âThrow off thy visor!â Spake the English Knight. âLet me confusion see, and thy deep shame.â Edwall his head unmasks! Stanley starts back! âFraud! Treachery!â loud he cried. âThou art not he!â Frantic with rage, the indignant Knight exclaim'd. âSay what thy name, and wherefore in this hour âOf sweeping vengeance dost thou dare our rage?â Edwall replied. âWarrior! My words regard. âBehold a Cambrian Chief! Edwall, my name. âBy Menai's strand, David I late received. âHe is my friend! Our every day, from youth, âHas but cemented, and new fortified âThe mutual and strong bias of our heart. âMatchless is David's worth, and even, to me, âHis foibles have endurance. When I saw, âFast-fleeing, that thy eager band advanced, âHard on his steps, I turn'd. He pass'd me by, âI thy pursuers sought, and offered up, âAs David, to their rage, my forfeit life. âI am thy captive. David now secure, âWreck on this head the vengeance due to him.â O'erwhelm'd with admiration, Stanley spake. âMistake me not. Brave man, thou art my friend! âSuch stuff as thou art form'd of, is my pride. âWe were not made for foes. Free as the air, âSpeed on thy course, and, with thee, take my prayers.â A band is seen fast rushing from the hill! Stanley, and all around, look wan and wild. David, escaped, nor seeing Edwall near, With frantic spirit, gazing round, awhile, Stood whelm'd in anguish and soul-probing pangs. When spying Bangor's towers, castle renown'd, Thither he sped and cried, âCambrians, attend. âA slender band and rav'nous, on our shore, âHave touch'd for plunder. We must feed our spears âUpon these Saxons. David leads you on.â Eager they hasten, vengeance in their eye, And breathing death. Now, from th' adjacent hill, The foe they spy, down strew'd along the beach; And thither rush to deal remorseless fate. Edwall beheld the Cambrians fierce advance. âI meet them,â he exclaim'd. Forward he hastes. David receives his friend! Their hearts alone. And their bright eyes told their felicity! Edwall at length exclaim'd. âStop, valiant man! âThese are not foes. Stanley, yon English Knight, âDemands thy love. His prisoner I became, âA willing captive, David to preserve! âWhen I my motive and my name declared, âAnd offer'd him, freely, my forfeit life; âBrave man, he said, we were not made for foes: âSpeed where thou wist, and my best prayers be thine.â A sudden smile of joy, warm from the soul, Fill'd David's countenance. To Stauley, near, Hastening, he cried. âHarmless, thy course pursue. âTho' different names be ours and different homes, âChieftain, thou art my brother and my friend.â With heart o'erflowing, Stanley thus replied. âNoblest of Cambria's sons, thou hast my praise. âThy generous valour long shall be my theme. âBefore we part, list to the voice sincere: âTread not the ocean verge. Out, far away, â'Mid yonder coast, Seymour, in ambush, lies âTo seize thee, and conduct thee to our chief,â âTalbot, to quench whose ire ten thousand lives, âWere they thy boast, he fain would immolate.â David exclaim'd, âThou art a valourous Knight! âOne small return for this thy faithfulness; âInstant our general strength, shall to the wave, âLaunch out thy bark.â Now, down the yellow strand, Before the stout and strenuous multitude, Slowly it glides. The English warriors waft To their admiring foes (the same return'd) From the green ocean and the crowded deck, Greetings effectual, sent from heart to heart, Touchstone of rectitude, and now the bark Sails on toward Mona, whilst Prince David turns, With Edwall, to endure Llewellyn's frown. All missile weapons and war instruments In Conway's towers were form'd. Llewellyn there, And Vychan, took their stand, prepared to meet Edward advancing. Never firmer hearts Look'd on to conquest. Sounds of death to them Were music, soft and sweet, heard evermore; For 'mid the day, and at the hour of eve, Thro' all the place, one constant noise was heard, Anvil and hammer; and when night came on, The same unceasing note mix'd in their dreams; Yea, from brief slumbers and 'mid darkest shades, When they aroused themselves, half dreaming still, The sound which brought them to full thoughtfulness Was the shrill-clinking anvil and the forge Breathing its hissing blast. One eager came. He sought Llewellyn. Thus aloud he spake. âMona, our Isle, is fall'n! Fierce Venables, âAnd Talbot's Earl, have ravaged that fair spot.â Llewellyn cried, âDark and disastrous news! âWhat more? Declare!â The man his speech pursued. âMona is fall'n, but other tidings wait, âAt which all Cambria, with one general groan, âWill fill the elements. Our Bards are slain! âThey all have perish'd! Murdered in cold blood! âBy Fiends let loose and halloo'd on by Hell. âNot one this hour survives.â Llewellyn turn'd. The wall sustain'd him. âI have other news,â The man pursued. âPrince David led them on. âThy brother, with the English force advanced. âHe plann'd and sanctioned all. He slew the Bards, âFor he had power to save.â Llewellyn cried, Clenching his hand, âDavid! thou prostrate man! âI tear thee, yea, each fibre from my heart! âA brother! once a brother!â One drew near, âEdwall!â he cried. Young Edwall now advanced. Llewellyn spake not: bathed in grief he stood. At length, slow gazing round, Edwall he saw. âOff!â he exclaim'd. âAs David, thou art base! âHateful! Away!â Edwall confounded stood. Llewellyn cried, âDavid hath proved himselfâ â(Thy friend, for whom thy solemn oath was past) âA most foul traitor! On his mountain crimes âBlack murder he hath heaped. The man who thinks, âOn monster such as he, with placid mien, âYea, without stormy hate and tempest rage, âIs his coadjutorâhis darker half! âArt thou prepared, still to advance one thought âThat David ranks above Hell's blackest brood! âI see thy shame!â Edwall replied, âO Prince! âBehold, in me, still David's advocate. âThe mists are flown. The sun now cloudless shines. âDavid is near! Contrition he hath felt, âSuch as shall touch thy heart, as it hath moved âEdwall to tears. He shall defend himself! âI lead him hither!â Edwall now retires. Llewellyn scarce believed the things he saw, The words he heard. In tumult and amaze, He gazed around, calling on reason's aid, To prove that all was real as it seem'd; When, David enter'd! Then his thoughts, anew, Flow'd in one tide indignant. Such a glow Of aggravated wrath beam'd from his eye, Its influence might be felt. David remain'd, Bending, and far away. Silence was round, When Edwall forward came and thus began. âBehold Prince David! Lend a patient ear, âNor scorn him utterly. Awhile restrain âThy kindling wrath! O fetter down thine ire, âA little space, till thou hast heard his words.â Llewellyn cried. âDavid! What seek'st thou here?â David advancing slow, at length replied. âO Prince! a crushing weight that man sustains âWho hath a loaded conscience. I am he! âCall me not brother! I have ill deserved âKindness or common mercy. It were right âTo seize my lifeâon Justice' shrine, to shed âDavid's most traitorous blood, and send his soul âDown to perdition. Hear me still, O Prince! âSlay me, but let my full heart first discharge âIts weight of woe. Let me declare my guilt, âAnd at the sentence, tho' to instant death âThou may'st ordain me, I will smile and sayâ âTo my deserts, this fate is lenity. âAmbition was my bane! I worshipp'd her, âBefore whom Satan bent, ere from Heaven's thrones âAlmighty Power hurl'd him, to scenes of woe, âAnd doleful and enduring fires accurs'd. âA Prince by birth, lord of no mean domain, âI saw one mightier, braver, than myselfâ âYea even thee! when all my eminence âSank to a pismire's hill. Each good bestow'd âBy Heaven's high bounty, castles and fair fields, âWealth, and most general reverence from the crowd, âAll was forgotten. I Llewellyn sawâ âMy wiser and my better brother, sawâ âRaised to a crown, peering above my head, âAnd envy gnaw'd my heart. My anxious wife, âWhen moaning in the drowsy hours of night, âAsk'd me what dreams of death prey'd on my mind. âI answer'd not. My thoughts alone revolved âOn secret vengeance and unlawful deeds, âYea, to dethrone thee!âhow to sit secure âWhere now thou sittest, and thy sceptre sway, âScorning impediment, or great, or small. âThe image of a crown haunted my dreams. âI thought my life and all that I possess'd âBaubles for slaves, whilst there was one, whose word âDavid was forced to hear and to obey. âIn the sore anxiousness of mind diseas'd, â(With lofty hopes and wilder'd plans, unfledg'd, âTho' heedless of the thing which I required) âWith fierce austerity, I ask'd of theeâ âA brother's share of Griffith's heritage. âThou didst admit my right, and pledge thy faith, âTo grant me, when the battle's rage was o'er, âMy amplest claim. I knew full well, with thee, âThat both to promise and fulfil were one, âYet, more, I coveted. I sought thy crown!â âI sought to reign supreme o'er Cambria's land; âNew visions fill'd my mind. New plans and great. âI deem'd that if I found our deadliest foe, âAnd, to his secret ear, proffer'd, to own, â(If he would raise me to my father's throne) âVassal allegianceâhim, to call my lord, âAnd sovereign potentate, that I might then âSleep 'neath the canopy, and, to my might, âAnd power efficient, trust, to break again âThese fetters, just assumed. Tho' then my heart âTold me, that not a being breath'd heaven's air, âWhom I could call my lord! yet, confident, âThat when the prize was gain'd, I might throw off âAll trammels, and by valourous feats of arms âRegain my loss, I my proud spirit sooth'd. âThus with deceit and villainous intent, âAt Chester, England's haughty king I sought, âHe welcomed me. He promised, with an oath, âAll I required, yet knowing my designs, âHim I suspected. Now the stream was past. âHere there might be a harvest, all beside âWas black sterility. Edward required, âMy aid, with Venables and Talbot's Earl, âTwo bloody men! to seek and to subdue âMona's fair land. Forced to the grating task, âWe thither sail'd, and after a hard fight, âWe conquer'd the green isle. âThen was the time âWhen Bards, from utmost Cambria, for a feast âOf sacred minstrelsy, to Mona flock'd. âThe Druid altar and the forest shades, âStill sacred, offer'd them a calm retreat. âGood men will spurn the calumny on manâ âYes Venables proposed, while Talbot smiled, âTo slay these Bards!âthe heaven-taught sons of song! âLest they should rouse the Cambrian spirit up, âBy singing of brave ancestors, to stem âEdward, and drive him from the field of fight! âI am no murderer! My ardent soul âResisted, threaten'd, pleaded, but in vain! âOne Bard alone I saved. Old Caradoc! âOur father's Bard, The Chief Bard was one of the twenty-four great officers in the Court of the Princes of Wales, of which sixteen belonged to the Prince and eight to his Consort. The Prince's officers were the following: 1. The Mayor of the Palace, who was also General of the Army. 2. The Priest of the Household, who sat at the royal table to bless the meat, and chant the Lord's prayer. 3. The Steward, one of whose perquisites was the following: âAs much of every cask of plain ale shall belong to the steward of the household, as he can reach with his middle finger dipped into it, and as much of every cask of ale with spiceries, as he can reach with the second joint of his middle finger, and as much of every cask of mead as he can reach with the first joint of the same finger.â 4. The Master of the Hawks, who was permitted to sit at the King's table, but who entered into a stipulation that he would drink no more than three times, lest he should become intoxicated and neglect his birds. 5. The Judge of the Household, the most indispensable of whose qualifications were, a learned education and a long beard: he presided at the contests of the poets and musicians which were frequently held before the King. 6. The Master of the Horse. 7. The Chamberlain, one of whose obligations was, to provide clean straw and rushes for the King's bed. 8. The Chief Musician or Bard. This officer was always very highly esteemed by the Welsh King. He sat at the King's table next to the Mayor of the Palace. âAt the time he was invested with his office, the King presented him with a harp, and the Queen with a gold ring, both which he was obliged to keep as long as he lived. It was his duty to sing and play before the King, 1st. the praises of God, 2d the praises of the King, 3d. a subject of his own choice. He attended the army to battle, and before an engagement sang and played a particular song called the British Empire.â 9. The Silentiary. It was the duty of this officer to command silence in the hall when the King sat down to table; and when any quarrelling or improper noise arose, he immediately quashed it by striking the pillar with his rod. 10. The Master of the Huntsmen, who whenever he gave his oath was not required to swear, in the way that others did, but always by his horse and his dogs. 11. The Mead Maker. 12. The Physician, whose fee for curing slight wounds was, all the garments that had been stained with blood: for fractured sculls or broken legs or arms, he was entitled in addition to 180 pence. 13. The Butler. 14. The Porter, who was gentleman usher to the King, and who was entitled, at each of the great festivals, to three horns-full of a certain liquor called the twelve apostles. 15. The Master Cook; and 16, The Master of the Lights. Besides these sixteen officers, there were eleven others, one of whom was a young gentleman, whose duty it was to sit on the floor, with his back to the fire, and hold the King's feet in his bosom all the time he sat at table, to keep them comfortably warm. All the principal families in Wales entertained a Bard, as a permanent resident. who charm'd our infancy, âAnd on whose knee we sat, half thro' the night, âDrinking his songsâone man alone I saved, âThe aged Caradoc. That hour I fled! âUpon the beach, all darkness, up and down, âI paced distracted! Then my heart returned! âThe film from my glazed eye-ball downward fell! âI saw the hideous gulf which I had pass'd! âI saw the precipice on which I stood! âI saw my crimes, darker than ever yet âMan had sustain'd! and to fulfil the shade, âOf scaring aspect, I beheld, e'en those âWhom I had call'd my friends, savage of soul, âEspousing not my cause, and who restrain'd âTheir fiery purpose till some favouring hour, âOnly, to level Cambria with the dust! âMy spirit then return'd. Anguish supreme âRevell'd within me. I deplored too late âMy wretchedness; most causeless wrong to thee, âThe best of brothers; injury to the land âThat gave me birthâCambria, the Queen august, âMy parent! My dear parent! name adored! âThro' infancy (unnatural matricide!) âWhose breasts, unconscious, nurs'd me with delight. âI saw my abject state. Scorning myself, âI view'd, with untold agony, my fame, âThat a long line of noble ancestors âHad handed down immaculate, all lost! âAnd I an outcast, scorn'd of Heaven and Earth! âMy infants, for whose manhood, I had oft âAnticipated glory, and look'd on, âTo hear them boast of their illustrious Sireâ âNow plunged, I saw, in deep and endless shame! âAmbition! O thou serpent of my heart! âHow did I curse thee! Thee, for whom I thus, âHad barter'd all things, joy and peace below, âAnd happiness, in that approaching world, âTo which I once could look, not sad, but now, âMy deepest torment. O my country dear! âMy native Cambria! Never, till that hour, âDidst thou appear so sweet! Thy hills and dales, âThy cataracts and streams, thy woody glens, âLay tangible upon my feverish brain! âI would not then have hurt thee, with a touch âOf softest down, if all earth's potentates âHad proferr'd me their thrones. Dear native land, âWilt thou forgive thy most injurious childâ âThat he should ere have leagued with foreign hordes âTo thy dishonor? Were it possible, âThat in thy plentitude and potency âOf noble deeds, thou couldst receive again, âThe son that pierced thee, pierced a mother's side, âThis heart, inveterate at so black a deed, âWould hold its scorn, stable as heaven itself.â He ceas'd. Llewellyn started from his seat! He fell upon his neck! Feebly he cried. âMy brother! Thou wast lost, but thou art found!â No voice was heard. A solemn hush prevails, Sacred to feeling and the influence Of soul with soul. At length, Llewellyn cried. âNow David, we are friends! The past hath sunk, âE'en ere I spake, to the profoundest depths âOf dark oblivion. Hear my kindest words. âIt is affection and solicitude âMost tender, for thy welfare and thy fame, âThat prompts my speech. âDavid! I know thee well. âI know the noble bearings of thy mind, âThy lofty qualities, but, 'mid the wheat, âThere is a tare, ambition. Never more âLet it grow up and choak the blessed seeds âOf virtue, that might else, lift thee to Heaven. âLet us unite, alike, our hearts, our hands, âTo scourge this haughty Saxon, and, with shame, âDrive him from Cambria, which perform'd, I swear, âHere in the presence of that God, whose ear âRegards the faintest whisper, and whose eye âBeholds the heartâI swear, to do thee right! âTo grant thee all that justice, in her hour âOf largest longing, asks, and to maintain âTrue brotherhood, affection and kind deeds. âYea, I will make thee Prince o'er Powis-land. âIs there besides, O David, in thy soul, âAught that thou covetest?â David exclaim'd, âNothing, my Brother! My most reverenced Friend! âThy generous promise bounds my utmost hope, âYea, far exceeds it. Ere this calming hour, âThe trammels of ambition I had burst. âI hate her! She had well-nigh deluged me âIn her mad vortex, but some guiding hand, âTho' secret, led me to the better way. âIf it were possible, that in my heart âOne fibre and thin ligament remain'd âOf lawless aspirationâhear it Heaven! âLlewellyn, by thy high and generous deeds, âThou wouldst expel it. It were blasphemy, âAgainst man's open and regenerate heart âTo doubt me more. Point thou my future path. âTell me, where I may scare the English host, âAnd deal them ruin, horrible dismay! âThe future for the past, yet may atone.â Llewellyn cried, with soothing voice and mild, âHear me, brave David! I will instant prove âMy confidence in thee, and in thine arm. âEdward, that bane of Cambria, hath subdued âLate Denbigh's castle. With the Saxon's heart, âCynan he murder'd, yea, each man who breath'd, âHe, on his sanguine altar, offer'd up! âNot one survived! Dying, each cried aloud, âEach Cambrian, in the struggle hard of death, âThis bloody deed, my country shall avenge. âThou, David, shalt perform this sacred trust. â'Mid Conway we abide, gathering our strength, âWhilst Edward wastes, and desolates, and deems, âThus unresisted, Cambria half subdued. âWe lure him to his ruin! At this spot, âOur stand we make, panting to prove once more âOur glory, and the terror of our sword. âTake with thee a brave host, well to be spared, âAnd do thy best, which well I know includes, âAll possibilities of high emprise.â David replied. âI go! When next we meet, âTriumph shall fill my eyes and words be vain. âThe lightning not more zealous to ingulf âHis forked fires in earth, than I, to prove âMy penitence, and on the English ranks âTorrents to pour of wrath insatiable. âHear me, Llewellyn! One request is mine. âLet Edwall be my second. Braver man, âMore faithful to his Prince, or one endued âWith purer emanations of the heart, âIn holy friendship's cause, hath never lived.â Llewellyn answer'd, âGo! Success be yours!â And now toward Denbigh's towers they speed their way. One entering cried. âA Bard awaits without.â The Prince exclaim'd, âOld Caradoc, my friend! âHe is the only Bard Cambria now boasts! âIt is a cordial that e'en he survives. âAdmit him.â Lo, he hastens. In his arms, Llewellyn, Lhyrarch clasps! When utterance came, The Prince exclaim'd. âArt thou a ghost, or he?â âE'en Lhyrarch,â Lhyrarch cried. âMerciful Heaven âHath spared me, when the storm of death was round.â âTell me!â Llewellyn cried. âO satisfy âMy longing ears, altho' it rend my heart; âTell me of Mona and her injured Bards.â Down Lhyrarch's cheek, the tear fast-trickling fell; Wiping the big drop from his eye, he said. âOf sorrow, brave Llewellyn, I have known âAn old man's portion, but the cup at last, âJust when I quit a world of wretchedness, âHath been most bitter. I have seen my friends, âWhose countenance was pleasant as the morn, âSlaughter'd by savage men.âI will repress âTh' o'erflowing feeling. Briefly I must speak. âThe English Chieftains, after a fierce fight, âConquer'd our Isle. By treachery, Venables âFound out the secret covert of our Bards; âAnd as we crowded, in the centre wide âOf Druid Altar, hoping naught of good, âNor dreading ill, we saw the fierce-eyed band, âRush toward us, with the unsheath'd sword on high! âThen, death was manifest! Some, âMercy!â cried; âSome, on the ground, fell prostrate; some implored, âUpon their knees, pardon for unknown crimes. âSome fled distracted. Vain, alas! their flight. âThe murderers sword was near! On all sides round, âThe cry of mercy, and the shriek of death, âSounded aloud.âMy brethren, in that hour, âAll perish'd! Perish'd by the Saxon sword! âI, with the flying Bards, sought the near woods! âAll, crowding round me died! And I, for death, âLook'd instant, when a youthful Knight drew near âI saw his sword, and my heart sank within! âI raised my hands, but language I had none. ââOld Bard!â He cried. âI will preserve thy life, âStanley will be thy guardian! Speed with me! âThis wood be thy retreat!â I look'd at him! âI only look'd. He knew the spirit's voice. âHe sigh'd and said âFarewell!â Thro' bough and brake, âI rush'd impetuous, and each step I heard, âMurder's loud shriek! A sound that, in my ear, âHangs like the sun in heaven. O that my brain âMight lose the memory of that dreadful sound! âAll night I fled. I reach'd the distant beach, âAnd there, amazed, I found old Caradoc!â âAs lonely as a solitary weed, âFloating on the immeasurable sea. âA drifting boat was near. âFly!â I exclaim'd. ââLet us escape to Cambria!â Then I saw, âBy his bewilder'd look, and heedless air, âThat he had lost his reason! There he was âPacing alone, and whilst the passing breeze âDisturb'd his hoary locks, often he call'd âUpon the mermaid. With his harp he pour'd âA mournful ditty, and to every wind, âAnd every wave that roll'd along the shore, âTold of his wrongs. The mermaid was his call. âHe said, that human hearts had ceas'd to feel, âAnd he would sing, only to her he loved. âPoor aged Caradoc! I cried, âEscape! âThe hour is perilous!â Upon my harp, âHis gaze he fix'd. âArt thou a Bard?â he said. âHe knew me not, most miserable sight! âThe man, whom most I prized, knew not his friend! âHis vacant eye-ball, in strange fits, and wild, âRoll'd o'er my face. âArt thou a Bard?â he cried. ââThou art! One kindred spirit yet survives! âO, no! They all are slain! Their songs have ceas'd! âTheir lips are cold! Ah! heard'st thou that? he said, âThat soft and tender note, borne on the breeze? âIt is the injured dead, from their bless'd bowers, âCalling on Carodoc.â With starting tear, âEarnest again I cried! âMy brother Bard! âLet us escape! Here is the wave, and here âThe friendly boat to waft us o'er the tide.â âHe heard me not, but touching his sweet harp, âFor ardour famed, but most for tenderness, âTurn'd and his solitary path pursued. âHere would I stop, Ah, no! it must be told. âBefore him stood a rocky pinnacle, âFar jetting o'er the sea. Toward it he sped. â(A sudden gust, starting from death to life.) âI follow'd hard. I saw him climb the steep! âWhen standing now upon the awful brow âHe raised his harp. I paused. The witching sounds âEntranced my spirit. Tho' the sky was clear, âAnd peacefully the sea-gull skimmed the wave, âHe thought it midnight and fierce hurricanes. âThe last song of thy aged Caradoc, âUnmoved thou wilt not hear. Thus sang the Bard: Like a watch-tower, I stand on the verge of the sea, Whilst the tempest arous'd in his vehemence raves. The deep tones of ocean, how fearful they be, When the storm wraps in darkness the mountainous waves! What transports are these! Like myself, in despair The white-headed billows dash madly the shore: I love the rude tumult, the rocking of air, And music to me is this perilous roar. Behold! The red thunderbolt ranges the sky, Beside, rides a Spirit! Ere beheld, he is past! Ah! seize in thine anger the bolts as they fly, And crush me an atom upwhirl'd on the blast. I once dwelt with men, I have laugh'd o'er their tomb, Ah, no, I have wept, and fresh tears I will shed. What shadow is thatâwhich still deepens the gloom? I see it! It speaks! Ah, the vision is fled! Ye lightnings burst round me! Your terrors I hail. Come drest in fresh vengeance, thou torrent of fire! With destruction o'erwhelming all nature assail, And let the last gleam of existence expire. The earth with foul spells hence to Demons is bound, If I look to the sky their dread legions appear; If I mark the wide waters conflicting around, Each wave is a car for the Beings I fear. My Harp! is it thou? hast thou seen me forlorn?â In his anguish, one friend cheers old Caradoc's sight. Thou art dearer to me than the blush of the morn To the mariner wreck'd in the blackness of night. Oppress'd and forsaken, thy sympathies bear; O come, whilst I lean on thy joys as I go, I will strive to forget a vile world with its care, And pluck from my heart the deep arrow of woe. Off! Off! Fiends accurs'd! In confounding array, They have seized my sweet harp! From the clouds dark and dread, Lo! a whirlwind advances! O bear me away On thy wild wing of fury to rest with the dead. âThus having sung, with a stupendous leap, âFrom the tall crag, he plunged into the sea! âThe harp, for which he died, dropt from his hand! âHe thought it seized of Fiends. Friend of my heart, âI would forget his end, not his dear name. âO Prince! for thee and thine my prayers arise. After a pause, to feeling sanctified, Faultering Llewellyn cried, âI heard the tale âOf Mona's minstrels. Little then I deem'd âThat thou wast safe. I fear'd to think of thee. âO Caradoc!âI must restrain my tears, âAnd bind my heart with fetters of firm brass. âLhyrarch! thou seest us in the whirl of strife, âTh' impending hour is ominous, and comes âIn black array. Erelong and we will blend âOver our fallen Bard, and his hard fate, âAnd o'er his friends, the friends of human-kind, â(Our glory blotted out) perpetual sighs. âNow to contend with England's Lord I speed.â BOOK XIX. SCENE, David's march to meet Earl Mortimer. Over thy waters, Conway! smooth and wide, With his brave company David now pass'd. Far had they march'd, and weary were the hours, Pacing so languidly their beaten round That kept them from the fight. A host is seen Circling a mountain's base, and fast they speed. âArms! Arms! The Enemy!â One cry is heard. âNow for the contest.â Near, a wood appear'd. David exclaim'd. âBe they, or friend, or foe, âThis covert we will seek, prepared to act, âAs courage and as wisdom may prescribe.â Howell, that gallant Chief, foremost in war, And nurs'd in danger, Cambria's noble Prince Had sent to scourge the English Mortimer, Felling his forests. Spacious waste was made. The aged trees, throughout the day, fell down Crashing on every side, whilst the stout axe And axeman's voice, groaning before the blow, Sounded incessant. When her lofty towers Rhudland resign'd to Edward, he indulged Hopes of a speedy conquest of the land. Moved with high confidence, that scorn'd all doubt, Edward a herald sent to Mortimer, Bidding him spare his toil and instant join His march of victory. The English Earl, Pleased to renounce his tame inglorious strife, And mix with war, and feats of valourous name, The languid axe cast scornful from his hand, And sped to taste of conquest. On he march'd, Exulting in imagined strifes, whose ends All turn'd to glory!âSuch the placid mien Fancy assumes, when, as self-love directs, Men point her course, whilst she, obsequious, bends, Passing before. Like two adventurous ships, Each on her course, fast passing thro' the seas, In dead of night, when moon and stars are veil'd, And all is silence and undoubting ease; Like such unconscious barks, thus sailing on, And, unexpected, meeting on the main, The gallant Howell and bold Mortimer Join'd in the woody dell and instant clash'd Buckler and sword! Ah, Howell! In that day, Tho' thou hadst made a league with victory, (So men might judge, from thy triumphant march, Thro' a longlife of triumph and of war) Thou wast defeated! Fast the Cambrians flee Before Earl Mortimer; some hurrying on, With rapid footstep; some, on speed intent, Then pausing, half resolved to face the foe, (A momentary thought!) then, east and west, Flying precipitate, confusion all. So when the snow-storm, with its darkling spots, Directs its feathery arrows to the earth, All regular, if the impetuous wind Rudely advance, and eddying blasts sweep loud Th' incumber'd firmament, the marshall'd flakes, Thrown into tumult, fly on devious wing; Some buoyant, doubtful where to take their course, Others impetuous, rushing on their way, Or here, or there, the raging foe behind, Whilst their sole hope and refuge seems in flight. All in amaze, the vanquish'd now had reach'd The spot where David lay. Howell he saw, Fleeing amain. To his indignant host (Safe in their covert, 'neath the woodland shade) The Chieftain cried. âLet these our friends pass on. âThe foe is near them.â Now Earl Mortimer, Around the mountain's base, down thro' the glen, Bleach'd with tall stones, pursues the fugitives. David exclaim'd âAdvance!â Earl Mortimer Thought only of pursuit, of victory sure, And now he bears the weight of David's wrath. What mighty deeds are there! The war of men. The javelin and the sword and axe fall hard. Ah! Mortimer! A foe is drawing onâ David is near thee! Now they join in fight! Two Lybian lions, weaker and less fierce. That blow!âOne more, O reeling Mortimer! One more such merciless and crushing blow, Would whelm thy spirit in the tide of death. Again his arm descends. The battle-axe Earl Mortimer's stout helmâshivers. He fallsâ Vanquish'd before the Cambrian's potency! The strife is o'er. âMercyâ and âQuarter!â sound! âRev'rence the vanquish'd!â David shouted forth. And now, with pitying spirit, he upholds, Fainting and bruis'd, the Earl, who still has life, As oft as the defeat, rose in his mind, To dart a glance, wilder'd and wrathful round. David now spake. âTho' thus my prisoner, Earl! âThou hast a generous foe, who knows to prize âValour like thine. This thought must cheer thee upâ âThat, tho' defeated by the chance of war, âThou hast deserved success, and victory âHath blossom'd oft, on brow less brave than thine.â Earl Mortimer slowly declined his head. âHigh minded Prince!â He cried, âthou hast my thanks. âThe chain is heavy, but it galleth not. âConquer'd by such a chief, I bend to fate.â The cares that wait the victor, after fight, Were not, by David, slighted. Feeling heart, (When the aspiring Demon fled his breast) David possess'd, and all, whom death had spared, The mangled lying low, from highest Heaven, Call'd down the choicest blessings on his head. It was a goodly interview and sweet, When, after the hard fight, David his friend Embraced ecstatic. Edwall loud exclaim'd, Joy in his heart, and pleasure in his eye, âThis is the cheering promise, the first bloom âOf future victories; the vestibule âTo Fame's proud Temple. Thou shalt yet arise, âMatchless in valour. Cambria to thy arm âHenceforth shall look, with proudest confidence. âWhat say'st thou now, David, my gallant Prince, âTo that sweet tide, on which thou late didst gaze, âEnamour'd, half resolved, to plunge and lose âRemembrance of the past in death's cold arms?â âEdwall I thank thee. Many thanks are due,â David replied, âthat thou hast forced me thus âTo think on that distracting hour, when death, âYea, when self-murder, seem'd a blessed thing! âI tremble at the verge whereon I stood! âIt seems a dream! Could I, at aught below, âSo mourn, yea e'en at folly or at crime, âHowe'er stupendous, or at poverty, âTho' abject or misfortunes, dark and deep; âCould I so grieve, at aught beneath the sky, â(All transient things!) as to prefer long sleep, âTh' extinction of life's taperâthe drear bed, âEarth for her children makes, where never ray âIrradiates the gloom, but all is darkâ âCold, silent, and unsocial, whilst the worm âBanquets unseen! Could I in madness scorn âHeaven's precious smiles, the mansions of the blest, âMy happiness beyond this span of time? âTremendous thought! Edwall! Full well I learn, âThat tho' the spirit may contend awhile âWith wretchedness, and horror round the head âWeave a dark garland;âtho' the last faint hope âMan may resign, and misery invest âEach prospect, and each form (cheering before) âWith its sad retinue of doleful things; âIf he have firmness to indure the night, âSustain the frost, and weather out the storm, âFair havens wait, and ample recompence, âE'en for the most forlorn and destitute âAmong earth's children. I had well nigh plunged âInto a gulfâO Edwall, spare the thought! âMy spirit, in the hour when darkness reign'd, âHad well nigh spurn'd rudely the precious giftâ âThis life, (the germ of immortality!) âInto my Maker's hand, return'd it back âDisdainful, and his fiercest frowns defied! âThou art a pearl indeed. Edwall, to thee âWhat owe I not? Adversity, that test, â(From which the false friend shrinks, as ice from fire,) âThou hast withstood. The blast, that drives the chaff âUpon the winds of Heaven, moves not the wheat. âWhen these our days have run their destin'd round, âMay virtuous men arise, and talk of us, âAnd of our friendship, e'en of Edwall's love, âAnd David's gratitude. Best, kindest friend, âWords are weak symbols of th' o'erflowing heart!â Posting, with rapid speed, a man draws near: Aloud he cried. âPembroke, the English Earl, âRhuthynon's Castle, Cambria's noble pile, âJust hath subdued. Llewellyn, at this news, âShall hang his head.â âNot so,â Prince David cried, âWhat hath been seized on once, may fall again. âEdwall! Rhuthynon be our instant prize!â âAgreed.â Cried Edwall. Scarce the words had past, When eager toward Rhuthynon's walls they haste. The tedious hours moved slow, and long the toil Courage sustain'd. At length the mark appears. Rhuthynon's turrets catch the parting day. Edwall to David spake. âThe night is near. âThe clouds have gather'd and the rain descends, âWhilst the loud wind blows hard. Were it not wise, âHere on this hill to pause, till morn's clear light âMakes manifest the road to victory.â David, one moment paused. âNay!â he replied, âKnow thou, my Brother! my heart-honor'd Friend! âBefore the morn, yon castle shall be ours, âYea and proud Pembroke! Not a needless hour âShall pass, before our swords for conquest strive.â âWell hast thou said,â cried Edwall. âI am free, âThis moment to pursue Fame's roughest road. âWith such a Leader, whom shall doubts disturb?â David replied. âWe will permit the light, âIts faintest beams to vanish from the sky; âThen for the strife.â The dead of night is come! And such an hour, so merciless and harsh, Might pall the stoutest heart. Not e'en a ray Glimmer'd in Heaven, whilst the descending rain In floods and cataracts, deluged the earth. The march begins. David his veterans leads, And Edwall follows. Down the mountain's side, Slowly they pass, and now have reach'd the vale, Thro' which conflicting streams, borne from the hills, By sudden tempests, foaming roar along; Whilst the loud winds, in their vindictive rage, Revel among the forests, and augment The horrors of the hour, by conflicts fierce With unseen forms, and all terrific things. The sable elements, in ten-fold gloom, Now wrap themselves, portending ruin dire, And the stupendous movements, Nature holds, Amid Earth's central caves, when bellowing forth She wakes the Earthquake. Blasting with its glare, The lightning from the mountain summit bursts, And, what a roll of awful majesty Dwells 'mong the hills! each peal ascending still, In more magnificence of solemn sound! âDavid surprized the Castle on Palm Sunday, in a stormy night.â âCarte. Regardless to the fray, David moves on, As happy as the storm-delighting bird, Peteral, that far away, between the waves, Rolling their monstrous heads, heedlessly sails, And banquets on the fish that pass him near, Driven from their cavern'd homes, by the rude surge. âHeaven will protect,â he cries, âPatriots, like us, âMid these wild scenes and jarring elements.â And now they stand, firm on the granite rock, And silent, 'neath Rhuthynon's frowning towers. The English Sentinel, in hour like this, When e'en the famish'd Wolf In the reign of Henry III. Peter Corbet was enjoined âto use all possible means for the killing and destroying Wolves, in all forests, parks, and other places, in the Counties of Glocester, Worcester, Hereford, Salop, and Stafford:â and all the King's liege people were required to assist in ridding the country of those noxious beasts. Wolves were common in Wales some centuries after, and still later in Scotland. Sir H. Cameron is said to have killed the last wolf seen in Scotland, in the reign of Charles II. dared not go forth, Shrank from the storm, and cowering 'neath the shed, Pitied the trav'ller. With their scaling cords, The Cambrians mount. David, upon the wall, First plants his footstep. Edwall second stands, And now the shout is heard, âDie! Or submit!â Darkness, and such a night, with horrors charged, Made every spirit shrink into itself; And now, to swell and aggravate the hour, âThe Foe! The Foe!â Blends its soul-shaking cry With the loud blast. An unknown enemy Comes doubly armed. Fancy augments his power, Whilst courage trembles at uncertainty. The gates are seized. David aloud exclaims, âVain your resistance! Stoop to Cambria's Prince! âDavid is near!â In wild confusion lost, The English, petrified, look on to death, Unknowing how to act, or where to flee. At length the English Chieftain loud exclaim'd, âQuarter! We yield!â Thus, in that hour of storms Rhuthynon fell, and Cambria's banner waved, When the morn brake, upon its loftiest tower. âBring forth Earl Pembroke!â David cried aloud. Gaston De Bern advanced and bending spake. âEarl Pembroke dwells not here. Few days are pass'd, âSince with a noble band, to Denbigh, nigh, âHe march'd, and left these towers to my defence.â David aloud exclaim'd, âPembroke, erelong âShall measure swords with one who fears him not.â The fetter'd prisoners, at their wretched state, Mourn and bewail: each, when the deed was o'er, Thinking what promptitude and quick resolve Might have perform'd, to save their characters, E'en when Prince David shouted, âVictory!â Wisdom which comes, like much of mortal kind, Too late to profit. 'Mid Rhuthynon's towers, To guard and to molest the passing foe, David a gallant chief and gallant band Leaves, whilst, with Edwall, he his course pursues Toward Denbigh, there to urge the future war. When Denbigh fell (that castle 'mid the hills, Near which the eagle scream'd and fed his young,) De Valence, from King Edward (whilst he march'd With England's victor host, toward Conway's flood,) Received its charge.âUnfledged in feats of arms, And fresh from his paternal nursery, He sought the warâburst from the baby haunt, Where he was fed with tales of valourous knight, Doing such wonders, that his name alone Struck terror thro' the foe, and passport gave Ever to vict'ry. âHath De Valence' name,â Proudly he cried, âhumbler significance? âIts sound is full, harmonious, form'd for fame! âKnighthood was given me, I will now confer âCredit on knighthood. Thro' my native land âDe Valence' name shall shine a meteor. âThe Damsel whom I love, and, for whose sake, âWarfare's austere and hardiest toil sustain, âShall hear my deeds from far and think herself âBless'd to receive the Flower of Chivalry.â This was his first campaign. âWar,â he exclaim'd, âWhen brave men are employed, is but a sport, âA jocund pastime. Tho' my days are young, âGraceful my brow the laurel wreath sustains, âBudding and fair. Whom shall I count it now âHonor to greet. Brother and equal made, âWith the most valiant, I will hold my head, âHenceforth, a mountain, towering 'bove the mists âAnd grovelling clouds that herd around my base. âOft when the sun refulgent rides thro' Heaven, âThe vernal shower descends, drenching the earth, âWith pearls and amethysts, so, on my head, âWar shall bestow her gems and honors proud.â When Edward first, on Denbigh's battlements, Stood, and maintain'd the honors of his name, Unnoticed, in the turmoil of the hour, De Valence was the last who on the wall Rested his foot, eyeing on all sides round, And cautiously, lest danger should be near. Howard (a valiant Knight) a Cambrian fell'd, Roderic, for worth and prowess far renown'd, Then follow'd the hard fight. De Valence saw The prostrate enemy, and toward him rush'd. âYield! Yield!â he cried, âor death thy instant lot!â The bruised man his languid eye-ball raised, âSpare me!â he feebly said, âmy strife is o'er!â De Valence cried, âThou Coward! I have mind, âWith thy heart's blood, to stain this burnish'd spear.â Tho' thus o'erpower'd, Roderic had long sustain'd A name amidst the brave, and valourous praise Was his soul's food. His arm was weak with fight, And his eye dim, with blood in combat lost, Yet, when he heard th' opprobrious coward's name, Unknown till then, the boiling blood once more His veins distended, and his languid hand Grasping a sword that lengthways by him lay, With a last effort, he De Valence' face, (Full, on the nasal organs prominent,) Hit with the hilt. Down fell the wounded Knight! The blood in copious torrents from his nose Flow'd circling round. âDead! Dead!â aloud he cried. âHelp, help the dying!â Some who heard the cry, Rush'd to his aid and bore him from the fray To place of safety. When the fight was o'er, Edward inquired what English Chiefs were slain, Or who were wounded and that day had bled. De Valence first appear'd, his nodding plume, His full long damask mantle, gold inwrought, From the time of Edward I. to Edward III. the luxury of apparel had proceeded to such extremes, that in the reign of the latter Prince some prohibitory statutes passed, which were enlarged in the third year of Edward IV. The following are some of the enactments: 1. That no person, of whatever estate, degree, or condition he may be, shall wear any cloth of gold, or silk of purple colour, excepting the King, the Queen, the King's Mother, his Children, his Brothers, and his Sisters, upon pain of forfeiting, for every default, the sum of twenty pounds. 2. No person under the estate of a Duke, shall wear any cloth of gold or tissue, under the forfeiture of twenty marks. 3. No person under the estate of a Lord shall wear any plain cloth of gold, under the penalty of ten marks. 4. No person under the degree of a Knight, shall wear any velvet in their doublets or gowns, nor any damask or satin in the same, excepting only the Esquires for the King's Body, under the forfeiture of forty shillings. 5. No person under the estate of a Lord shall wear any furs of sable, under the penalty of ten pounds. 6. No person under the degree of a Gentleman, possessed of ten pounds annual income or goods to the value of one hundred pounds, shall wear any furs, but of such animals as are to be found in this kingdom. Chaucer thus complains of the extravagance of dress in his day. âSuperfluitee of clothing maketh it so dere, to the harm of the Peple, not only the cost of the embrouding, the disguising, indenting or barring, ounding, paling, winding, or bending, and semblable wast of cloth in vanitee, but ther is also the costleive furring in hir (their) gounes, so much pounsoning of chesel to maken holes, so much dagging of sheres, with the superfluitee in length of tho foresaide gounes, trailing in the dong and in the myre, on horse and eke on foot, as well of man as of women, that all thilke trailing is veraily wasted, consumed, thredbare and rotten. If so be that they woldon yeve swiche pounsoned and dagged clothing to the poure Peple it is not convenient to were for hir estate, ne sufficant to bote his necessitee, to kepe hem fro the distemperance of the firmament. On the other side, to speke of the horrible disordinat scantnesse of clothing, to wicked entente. And moreover in the wrapping of her hosin â in white and red; white and blewe, or white and blake, or blake and rede, and so forth. Now as to the outragious array of Women, God wote that though the visages of some of hem semen ful chaste and debonaire, yet notifien they shewe in hir array of attire likerousnesse and pride.â His glittering gorget, and his armour bright, With divers metals studded, and emboss'd With pearls and gems, deluged with gore appear'd, (Not all his own.) âI have attain'd, he cried, âThe envied lot, O King, to shed my blood âFor thee, and in my country's noble cause. âTwo Cambrians, fierce as Alpine Wolves came on, âSworn to consume me; one I soon dispatch'd, âThe other, a stout man, warded my blows âWith such dexterity, that, never yet âFound I a task so hard. With spear and sword âWe fought, ferocious as the goaded bull. âAt length I slew him, and with emptied veins â(So wearied and o'erpower'd with the hot fray) âFell down beside him, half of life bereft. âNow do I wait t' achieve some new exploit. âIf well I stand, O Monarch, in thy sight, âGrant me a score of lances, that I, straight, âMay issue on the Cambrians, and explore âSome bold adventure, fitting English Squire.â Edward exclaim'd, âThou dost full soon begin âTo wear thy laurels. As my best reward âDe Valence! thou shalt stand henceforth the Knight. âYea more, I now appoint thee Governor âOf this hard-gotten castle. Thou wilt guard, âThe trust confided, well doth Edward know, âWith the brave man's unceasing vigilance.â âYes, by my potent sword!â De Valence cried. When Edward deeper into Cambria past, De Valence, stalking round, view'd well the place, And oft repeated in his burst of pride, âI am the Lord of Denbigh!â When the men, Whom he commanded, oft in idleness, Met in small groups, discoursing on the war, Before they knew that stranger foot was nigh, Oft would they hear the voice familiar, In hollow sound obscureâthought audible, âI am the Lord of Denbigh!â Pembroke's Earl, When to his arms Rhuthynon's castle stoop'd, Sought Denbigh, and De Valence honors paid, Claim'd by his prowess. The delighted theme That on De Valence' tongue foremost appear'd Was, scorn of Cambriaâcontumelious scoff Of British valour. As Earl Pembroke came, (Before he cast his buckler on the ground, Or wiped his brow, from the warm summer dew) He told with the enthusiast's ardent tongue Of his campaign; how he his laurels won, And how his grateful Prince, valour like his Rewarded with the Knighthood and high praise. And now with solemn voice and look sedate, He spake of his descent, of Ancestors Great ere the Flood, and with clear argument Push'd his high birth to Adam the first man. âSeveral pedigrees of the Welsh Princes, carry their descents quite up to Adam, and with the more certainty, as they say that âthe Welsh are the least mingled with Strangers, of any Natives of Europe.â The English Historians, however, namely, Matthew of Paris, Matthew of Westminster, and John Custorius, not to be behind hand with their neighbours, carry the pedigrees of Ethelwolf, Offa, and Alfred, in like manner, completely up to Adam.â The dawn arrived, for Pembroke to pursue His Monarch's footsteps. âStop!â De Valence cried. âWe will devote one day to merriment âEre thou depart, then may'st thou emulate, âYea, even surpass De Valence. On yon green, âDown by the brook that winds around the hill, âSome sapling squires shall tilt; we will enjoy âThe festive tournament.â Pembroke replied, âAgreed, Sir Knight! One day to merriment, âAnd then for solemn contest and hard strife.â When morrow came, the festive tournament Pass'd merrily, and many a tilt was won, And combat, with high skill, that might have gain'd No mean emprise, on war's ensanguined field. Whilst other sports succeed, the chieftains now Quaff the stout bowl, and with metheglin fumes Pour forth their spirits. âWell,â De Valence cried, âYou now, Sir Earl, must cut your way to fame, âTho' here the means are few. Rank cowardice âInfests this country. Brav'ry here may starve. âThere is no scope, no favouring circumstance, âNo precious opportunity, for men âUsed to hard blows, and eager of renown, âTo play their part. To fight and to defeat, âAre one in Cambria. With a slender host â(A Baron's retinue, some forty squires) âFrom end to end, throughout this blessed realm âOf blast and barrenness, I would go forth, âYea, with a thistle twig, drive Cambria's sons, âLike herds, where'er my fancy prompted me. âHear me good Earl. 'Tis an ungallant thing âIn Edward, e'en our Prince, against this land âTo lead so huge a force, the victory âWere without honor. I have half resolved âFrom this sword play, this pastime for the spear, âTo traverse Gascony and lands remote âWhere valour may find men!â Pembroke replied, âThe time hath been when Cambrians have fought hard.â âO no.â De Valence cried, âThe winds have fought. âThe torrents and the hills have done their part, âAnd famine, borne by the invading host, âHath often gain'd a prize, else far away; âBut, Cambria!âNoble Earl, never again âLet English Chieftain talk of Cambria's fame.â Communing thus, each at the caustic word Laughing aloud, Earl Pembroke and the Knight De Valence sat. David, with rapid march, Now hover'd near. The band preceding him, Sudden return'd and cried. âThe castle gates, âWide are expanded, and the English force âTilting upon the green.â David replied, âThis is our hour! Edwall, we march along, âSilent and secret. At the favouring point, âI will exclaim, âAdvance!â Agile of limb, âDo thou arrest the gate, I will surround âThe gallant Tilters, and take friendly part âBreaking the lance, unlook'd for; so the day âHaply may be complete.â Edwall replied, âMy arm thou dost not doubt!â and now they march, Silent and cautious toward the English force. De Valence and the Earl, still in their tent, Pursued their merriments. The generous mead Had given new vigour to their mirthful mood, And stored afresh their laughing faculties. De Valence cried. âPembroke, with such disdain, âHold I these Cambrians, that, by good St. George, â(Whose fame, erelong, De Valence shall eclipse) âI should esteem it cowardice, a blot âOn my fair fame, to lift my sturdy sword â'Gainst less than five, yea ten, in proper mood, âWith the Iberian shield, one Squire at hand âT' exchange the shiver'd lance, I would defy! âI know not fear. A shivering at the heart âSome do affirm hath been, but, far removed âFrom all my sympathies, I hear of it âAnd wonder how and what the thing might mean. âTell me, Sir Earl, hast thou ere known of fear?â Pembroke replied, âOnce and but once, Sir Knight.â De Valence cried, âSir Earl, it cannot be! âThou dost mistake. It had been calumny, âTold by another. People of all climes âWell knowâthe proudest squires and knights of earth,â âThat naught ere shook thy heart's stability. âThyself thou wrongest most unlawfully; âBut if the truth it be, tell it, Sir Earl, âThe time and circumstance which first awoke âThe tremor in thy breast. Thy will with mine, âI have some wish to know so strange a thing.â Earl Pembroke spoke. âIt happened in this way. âIt was an autumn night. Mild was the air, âAnd calm the sky. I stood beside my porch, âAnd thought it were a pleasant thing to roam âOver the wide illimitable down âStretching around. I thought on Amesbury's pile, âSeat of delight and hospitality, âAnd even resolved, at that unusual hour, âTo usher forth, and by the break of morn, âAt his first prayer, a welcome visitant, âJoin the good Abbot. At my spear I look'd, âThen gazed upon my armour, and what need, âScornful I cried, for these habiliments? âI spurn'd them, and went forth alone, and now âAcross the heath paced my half dubious way. âAt th' midst arrived, I stumbled and look'd down, âWith eye-balls strain'd, to see what cross'd my path.â âIt was a murdered man! Solemn I look'd âAnd wilder'd, what to do, or where to turn, âScarce knowing, yet my course I still pursued. âThe confines now I reach'd, when, on the breeze, â(In that dark hour and 'mid those dreary wastes, âSilence around, save the faint breeze of night,) âLoud wrathful words I heard, dissonance sad, âThat, o'er my face, seriousness sudden cast. âA glimmering I spied, full in my way. âAs I advanced, I saw, out on the heath, âFive horrid menâa gambling Band of Thieves! âMasters in wrong, impetuous to obtain âWealth, that the murdered man lately had cheer'd. âRage and fierce vehemence, swoln to new height, âFrom the unprosperous, fresher, on the air, âSounded, the note of Hell. With cautious step, âAnd with indignant feelings, to mark out âWhom Justice might, erelong, send to their deaths, âNearer I drew, and now distinct I saw, âMyself unseen, these men, whose visages âIn guilt were fearful, where maturity âAnd permanence of evil seemed to shew âTraces of demon origin, so vile. âOne as the spinning coin lighted on earth âHis lanthorn eager thrust, to mark who won, âWhilst the contenders, with suspended voice, âWaited the tidings, then, with rage unbound, âOr ruffian joy, untameable, look'd up âTo bless or curse their fortunes. Nearer still, âTho' cautious, I advanced, when I espied âTwo beings, fiercer than the fierce, I strove âNot to believe them women. As I look'd, âScarce breathing, sudden from the earth a Dog âOf monstrous frame, upsprang and with a bound âHad darted toward me, had not one at hand âWith words of soberment and strenuous might, âFast held him, scarce restrain'd. For my good sword âIn vain I felt! That moment fear was mine!â âIn apprehension, ever uppermost âTo haggard guilt, the murderous crew all turn'd; âHis business each forgot, each where I stood, âTho' veil'd with an impenetrable shade, âLook'd earnest, musing what of earthly things âAt that unseemly hour, there might be found. âO good Sir Knight, assault was not for me. âSlow backward I retired, and when at length âMy misty, spirit-looking form was hid, âEffectual, toward my home, sedate I turn'd, â(Sweeping around the murder'd man) and still âResolving at each step, no more, unarm'd, âAnd at the dead of night, to wander there.â De Valence cried. âBrave men till now I thought âAlways were brave. What didst thou fear Sir Earl, âFear man of mortal mould? Had I been there, âI would have marched up to the hellish crew: âOne hand had grasped the tyger-looking beast; âI see him dead! the other, arm'd with fate, âLike a magician's wand, had they not stoop'd, âInstant to abjectness had sent them allâ âAll, to their mother earth. Such feats to me âAre very playfulness. Safe in thy house, âWhat course was thine?â Pembroke replied, âThe bugle loud I blewâthe sound scarce gone, âMy Squires for war stood near. I lead them forth, âMidnight around, to where the Murderers lay; âWe seized them, and this hour, out on the heath âTheir lofty chains screak to the passing wind.â De Valence loud exclaim'd. âNow for my tale! â'Tis of the dwellers in this land of blast, âOf whom I speak. Be patient, good Sir Earl! âA Flemish Knight, once in my Father's hall, â(Who never told a lie, that would I swear) âSpake how he pass'd, wishing to see all lands, âThro' Cambria, when Llewellyn's brother boldâ âO pardon me! whose heart was in his heelsâ âA puny-chested, terror-stricken manâ âPrince David! one abased in Valour's eye, âAye, even he, 'gainst whom our swords are drawn, âWhen he, bold Champion, warfare dared to wage âWith one, an English Earl, in Dinevawr. âWith sturdy swords, five hundred fighting men, âNow had he train'd, and toward the waiting foe, âLed them, to gain fresh honors in the field!â âMark you, fresh honors! one unbless'd of fame, âWho never verged within ten thousand leagues âOf the remotest confines of renown, âYet this the boast of the green Combatant. âThe Fleming, from a hill, mark'd them beneath. âBy holy Mary and the Saints above, âThese were his words, ungarnish'd, full and clear âTruth is my pride. âI saw them march along, âRichly adorn'd, fine animals of state, âWho wealth had not, save in the outward form, âTho' if their hearts had been as truly mens' Queen Catherine, the widow of Henry V. (who was a French woman,) knew no difference between the Welsh and English, till after her marriage with Owen Tudor, when it was intimated to her that she was disgraced by her husband's kindred and country, who were represented as vile and barbarous. This excited a desire in the Queen to see some of Owen's kindred âWhereupon he brought to her presence John ap Meredith and Howell ap Llewellyn ap Howell, his neare Cozens, men of goodly stature and personage, but wholly destitute of bringing up and nurture, for when the Queen had spoken to them in divers languages and they were not able to answer her any thing, she turned round and said, they were the goodliest dumbe creatures that ever she saw.â History of the Gwedir Family. âAs were their statures, they no boyish sport âMight have afforded e'en to English Knight. âThese thirsters for renown, dauntless moved on, â(No enemy at hand, lifting the lance) âWhen an old Hag, a Beldame, from her cot âBeside a hill, rush cover'd, green with moss, âTottering came forth. The host of mighty men, âStopp'd sudden, as tho' Death before them stood! âRaising her stick of crooked thorn, she cried, â(The stout heart quaking) âPass not yonder brook! âFate waits behind, and dangers infinite! âThe Demons of the air now are abroad! âNo earthly foes are yours! Speed not this way!â âThey stopp'd; while fearful mysteries and clouds, âHung o'er their mind. Among the sapient host, âOne man, half-doubting, in the easy tone, âAsk'd her, her source of knowledge; each around âFelt the unseemly thing, and paus'd, to hear âThe sudden thunderbolt! for they, the Hag âHeld in such awful light, as some green slip, â(We once like them, tho' now so brave and bold) âSome urchin school-boy, who, with lifted eye, âAnd open mouth, and motion solemnized, âLooks toward his Master, greatest amongst men! âIn his stupendous eminence, who knows, âAll that he knows, and vastly more besides, âOf laws, and figures, and close-reason'd points âOf varied disquisitions, all profound! âAnd whilst he upward looks, at th' sun and him, âAlternate, which the greater, doubting still, âHe shudders, at the bold licentious tongue, âThat, with familiar word, dares to address, â(Regardless of the scourge,) so vast a mind, âWhom kings alone, blameless, might dare accost, âSave with bent head, and abject reverence! âO Chance, thou wicked Sprite! just at this point, âA Fox, escaping from his hiding place, âPass'd on before them. With a pallid cheek, âTrembling, Prince David cried. âMark you the sight! âThat's the Red Spirit of the mountains wild, âWhich now assumes the shape familiar. âI know him well!â To aggravate the scene âIn that perplexing pause, e'en whilst he spake, âA Raven, from near tree, thrice croak'd aloud! âPrince David cried, âAnd that's an Imp accurs'd!â âIt was enough. The full cup overflow'd! âThe flame burst forth! The heroes, with one gust âOf aggravated horror and amaze, âFled in wild tumult, David at their head, âLike a bold General, leading the way; âAnd whilst a lazy Hind might brace his sheath, âUpon a hill, distant an honest league, âThe Cambrians shew'd themselves, not looking back, âAnd trembling, as tho' Night-Hags follow'd them.â As thus De Valence ended his gay tale, O, what a shout was there! the echoing woods Relish'd the story, and amongst themselves, Kept long the merriment, loath to forget The laughsome tale of bold Prince David's flight. Earl Pembroke, holding still his shaking sides, Jocosely spake, âDe Valence, we will now âTurn Priests, and christen this heroic land.â âAye, Priests,â De Valence cried, âI will become, âBoth Priest and Sponsor. Well, my good Sir Earl.â Pembroke replied. âThis land of pigmy hearts, âWe will re-christen it and call it Wales!â âThe name which Edward gives it in disdain! Percy Enderbie gives the following origin to the name of Wales. âBecause the name of the country is changed, or rather mistaken by the inhabitants of England, and not by them called Cambry but Wales, I think it necessary to declare the occasion thereof, which is, that whereas the Saxons, a people of Germany, were the first that after the Brittains inhabited and ruled the greatest part of this Island, and drove the Brittains into that corner, which according to the manner of their country they called VVales, and the countrey men VVelshmen and the tongue VVelsh, that is to say strange, or not of them understood; for at this day, the inhabitants of the Low Countries call all their next neighbours' language, Honegaw, or others that speak French, VValsh, as a language to them unknown. Likewise the inhabitants of the Tyroll do name the Italian, their next neighbour, a VValshman, and his language VVelsh.â âAye!â cried the laughing Knight. âWelshmen and Wales!â A noise is heard without! One rushes forth: Back he returns and cries. âThese Welsh are near!â That moment David shouted. âFriends advance!â Edwall the gate hath seized! David comes on Like ocean's armed tide. Whelm'd in amaze, Spoil'd of their sport, the merry tilters pause. Each gazes impotent. Earl Pembroke rose. He grasp'd his spear and issued from the tent, To rally and lead on to meet the foe. De Valence cried, âWithhold! It is too late!â The Earl rush'd onward.âBearing all before, David advances. Brief th' unequal strife, âQuarter!â the English cry. The Prince restrains The Cambrians vehemence, and now the foe, Vanquish'd, submits to David's potent spear. Earl Pembroke yields his sword. The Cambrian Prince Asks for De Valence. Pembroke answer made. âPerchance he may be slain, befitting Knight, âDiscoursing valiantly, and whose high deeds âExceed all praise. Here at this cheerful tent âI last beheld him.â David, toward the spot, Moved with inquiring eye. He sought the tent, Not seeing him, âDoubtless,â he cried, âsome sword âHath pierced that Knight and he hath nobly fallen!â Beneath the table props, one cautious look'd. âA man is here,â he cried, âCoward! come thence!â No answer is return'd, and as the board Is borne awayâDe Valence shews himself! With cheek turn'd white and quivering lip, and pale, He raised his eye, just peeping 'neath his brow, To mark if sword suspended threaten'd death, But, answer naught he made. Brave Pembroke's Earl Glowing with indignation, cried aloud. âThou abject man! base as the sordid dust, âOn which thou seatest thine abhorred form, âThat we should both be captives, both alike âOne master ownâDefeat I could have borne, âBut this consumes me! Might I name one prayer, âO Cambrian Prince!âLeave this bold-worded man, âThis mouthing warriorâthis Round-table-Knight, âHere, where he is. Thy prisoner tho' resign'd, âWill not disturb thy rest, nor hurt thy cause!â David replied, whilst the smile vehement Sat on his brow, âDe Valence, Knight renown'd! âSit here secure! Thou Thing of Iunocence! âGo here or there, none shall molest thy way!â He said and left him, whilst Earl Pembroke's eye, One lingering glance, ineffable of scorn, Cast at the couchant Knight, who, to the Earth, Look'd and was silent. Still, as tho' resolved, There to breathe out his last, and when he diedâ To make that quiet spot his sepulchre. It is not uncommon for persons who are conscious of a particular deficiency, to endeavour to disarm suspicion by claiming the excess of some opposite quality. Pontoppidan, whose History of Norway is valuable as far as it relates the result of his own observations, but whose unphilosophical assent to many strange relations is well known, duly apprizes his readers that, âhe has endeavoured as much as possible to avoid the imputation of being over-credulous.â One of the many illustrations of this assertion, is the following. âThe air of (the Village) of Holtaalen contributes much to longevity, so that those Aged People who are tired of life, retire to some other place, where the air is less salutary, in order to get rid of the life of which they are weary.â Lord Bacon observes that a Soldier once boasted to Julius CÃ¦sar, of the number of wounds which he had received in his face, when CÃ¦sar, who knew him to be an arrant Coward, replied, âMy Friend, I would recommend you, when next you run away, to be very careful how you look behind.â The castle now secured, David returns To seek Llewellyn, with his captive Earls, Pembroke and Mortimer!âlate stout of heart, And towering in imaginations bold, Now sad, their glory in the dust laid low!â Even like two Oaks, in summer's rich attire, (Each on the neighbouring mount) spreading their limbs, In proud defiance to the winds, and still, In their supremacy and confidence, Calling, alike, the unborn age their own; Till, in an evil hour, the whirlwind's wrath Uptears their giant roots, and launches them, Upon the winged fury of the blast, Down to the subject vale, where they both meet, Sad partners in misfortune and dismay! BOOK XX. SCENE, Conway Castle. Contemplating the clouds, dark sailing on, Within whose breast the embryo tempest lay, Ready to burst and over Cambria hurl Terrible desolations, calm and firm, On ancient Conway's proud embattlements, Llewellyn stood. If aught could shake his soul, Or, of the end, infuse a creeping doubt, It was that many a Lord in Dinevawr, And spacious Powis (at this frowning hour When all that could with love inflame the heart Lay threaten'd and at stake) join'd not their Prince. Some pitiful and puny interests, Some jealousies, which men might blush to own, Kept them aloof, even when their country call'd With thundering vehemence. A transient pang Rose in Llewellyn's heart. A sigh escaped, Unconscious, at their base degeneracy; But when again he thought of Gwyned's sons, Supreme in valour, how their spirits glow'd With patriot fire; how they, when dangers rose, Presented as one man, their daring front Against the enemy, and round their Prince, Rallied and hurl'd defiance from their spears;â When he beheld at hand so brave a host, Long known to war and victory, his heart Shook the sear leaves indignant to the ground, And his far-spreading arms bared to the blast. âThere is a line of mist,â Llewellyn cried, To Malgwyn near, âdescending toward the verge âOf this broad river. I have mark'd its course; âIt hangs upon the earth, as tho' some stream âThere found its way, amid the frosted air. âThere is a motion too!âMalgwyn! Rejoice! âIt is the foe! Behold! Upon their shield âAnd waving spear, the sun-beam faintly plays! âAh! Heard'st thou that? Slow sailing on the wind? âThe trumpet speaks, and the uncertain sound âOf martial minstrelsy. Advance, O day! âWhen Edward or Llewellyn shall, aloud âShout victory.â Now, 'mid the Cambrian host, Loud exultation reigns. âThe foe is near! âEdward approaches to the Conway shores!â On all sides sounds. Llewellyn stands prepared, (With Cambria's veteran hosts, panting for fight And burning with intense resolves) to wield Nobly the sword, and if he dared advance, To whelm the foe in everlasting shame. Slow sailing down the broad-mouth'd Conway, barks, Crowding th' horizon, on the sight arose In terrible array. No thought sprang up In Cambria's breast, that, haply, to her aid, Some stout hearts hasten'dâon the spacious seas, She had no advocate, nor doubt remains Of their hostility and fierce designs. E'en like some Captive, who, thro' months and years Is steadfast to his pallet, and the cell, Where darkness and desertion hold their seat, And which, long use hath taught him now to love. He hears the grating door, far off, admit Fresh visitants, perchance the well-known step That hurries on, to cheer some happier mind, Round whom affection lingers, not subdued By bars and chains, but, 'mid the hasty tread, The circling turmoil, the inquiring voice, His heart ne'er palpitates, for well he knows No spirit pines for himâhe has no friendâ No soothing hopeâin the wide world alone!â A bare and blasted tree upon the moor? Llewellyn, whilst the crowded ships advance, Beheld them sail, nigh to the eastern shore, Far from the archer's reach, and as he saw, Spite of the heart of adamantine strength, Upon his brow, sadness, one moment, sat. The mists dispersed, loud to his troops he cried, âSons of Renown! The hour of victory âComes but too slow for spirits such as ours!â And now Llewellyn waits, calm in his strength, The conflict, on the margin of the flood. Edward, with his victorious troops renown'd, Now had arrived, matured in confidence, Near Conway's wave. The Castle, from the west, With its high towers, (reflected in the stream) Magnificent arose. Edward exclaim'd, âBehold the Key of Cambria! That possess'd, âAnd like the sea, our prospects have no bound. âBut where our fleet?â The water stay'd his course, He saw his prey, inflamed that aught should curb His ardent progressâlike Castilian bull, Foaming to goad the piercer of his flanks, Yet by impenetrable bars restrain'd. The fleet he now descries. Borne by the tide, The faithful barks advance, cutting their path Thro' dashing waters, whilst the foaming spray On each side turns. The ships, with gushing noise, Now permanent, increasing more and more, Now lost a little space, then rushing on, With the same hissing noise monotonous, Move thro' the waters, and their devious course, Mark with the line of bubbles, on the wave. In gallant trim the foremost now arrives. Her sails are slacken'd, whilst her ardent prow Drives up the strand; and now, fast following, Her hundred comrades crowd along the shore. Edward exclam'd aloud. âUpon the morn, âWe force our passage. On th' opposing bank âThe foe appears and never English heart âTurn'd from the proferr'd fight.â To meet the morn And prove the valiant deed, all now prepare. While yet the bright cloud linger'd in the east, All things, both for attack and for defence, Were ready, and the spirits of the host Which follow'd Edward, firm, inflexible, Were as the sea-drench'd rock. Llewellyn's heart, And his brave chieftains and his veterans true, Courted, not shunn'd the fight. Upon the shore, Ready to lift the sword and launch the spear, The Cambrians stand, a multitude that tired The gazing eye, all panting to pour out Their fury on the host that dared their might. Silent, th' opposing shore, narrow they watch, And mark the indistinct confusion wild Which there prevail'd; the shifting bark and men, Changing, like moon-beams, sportive on the wave. Now every ship is still and all is mute, And on the hostile shore, clearly appears A lofty man, in speaking attitude. It was a gallant ship which Edward bore, Her rival none had seen. Upon her prow The rampant lion stood, his fangs unsheath'd, Waiting new conflicts, whilst beneath his tread, Breathless the hunter lay. With agile bound, Edward, upon the monarch of the woods, Leap'd, and such burning and soul-rousing words Pour'd on the listener's ear, that each, himself Felt more than mortal. âNow,â he cried aloud, âI at your head, we sail to victory!â The trumpet sounds! Compact and fearlessly The barks advance. Now to the central tide They hasten, where the winds, indignant rave And the vex'd billows dash, and o'er the prow Pour their white-mantling foam. The brave Le Zouch, With Doddingsdale, cut thro' th' opposing wave, And, scorning danger, with their single barks, Move to the fight; anxious to build a name, And proudly guide the march of victory. So some fruit-bearing tree, in earliest spring, Ambitious to disclose beauties supreme, And lead the vernal train, charming all eyes, Waits not, till the mature and genial sun Bulwarks it round, but with the first mild breeze Outpours its host of sweets, exuberant, Till the unkindly blast, from slumber brief Rises, and nips its glories, all o'erthrown! So fared it, in the inauspicious hour, With you, bold warriors! Tho' you steadfastly Look'd on to fragrant honors permanent, Your end is near. Ah! Luckless Doddingsale, And brave Le Zouch! Better had you have borne The hostile billow, nor disdain have felt For dangers, and for Cambria's hardy sons. Proud of the honor of the foremost fight, They paus'd not to inquire, who were their foes, And what their prowess, and the likelihood, That two storm-shatter'd barks might lift their head Against Llewellyn; high in confidence That courage would work miracles, their hearts Scorn to await their lagging company, And on they rush, to the troop-cover'd shore. Near to the foe advanced, a thousand darts On all sides fall, piercing the bull-hide shield, And closing many a warrior's eye in death. Near him, brave Doddingsale beheld a youth Struggling with fate, the arrow in his side; He stoop'd to aid him. From th' adjacent beach Tudor beheld, and high his lance uprais'd. He hurl'd it, the unerring dart alights On Doddingsale, glancing his massy shield, And in his sinewy chest deep hides itself. The Chieftain falls! Writhing with pain, he look'd One moment to the skies, and utter'd, faint, âO God, have mercy!â When his languid eye Yielded its last faint ray, and down he sinks, On the expiring youth, for whom he fell. Le Zouch beheld the sight, sighing, and cried, âPoor Doddingsale!â Then unappall'd rush'd on With his vindictive band, to teach the foe Lesson of valour. Ere he reach'd the shore, Thick in each sail the dangling dart appear'd, While breathless men lay at his feet, and groans Sounded aloud, yet, heedless, on the prow Aloft he stands, crying to those around, âSupport your Chief! Instant I press the shore!â His lance, Llewellyn raised, which never yet Threaten'd and turn'd aside. He launch'd it forth! Le Zouch beheld it rushing thro' the air, And whilst he saw, he felt it in his heart! Breathless he falls! The rapid tide beneath Receives him, conscious of no lofty charge, And with the common dead, upon its breast, Disdainful of controul, bears him away. Robb'd of their leaders, round, the vessels wheel, And, shatter'd, fly for succour; as they turn'd, Vast Cader Idris heard the thundering shout. Short way they sail'd, ere they their Monarch saw. Edward, by hostile winds and stormy waves Check'd in his course, and in confusion thrown, Pauses to rally. Now his ships, anew, In one long line, present their daring front, And on he sails to meet the Cambrian spear. The barks, now near the shore, each side sends forth The fleet-wing'd dart. Scarcely the helms-man stands At his inglorious post, parching, to hurl Death on the foe. Again the arrows fly! As multitudinous, as some huge host Of locusts, bred on Afric's burning shore, When, having stripp'd their native fields of green, They rise, and, cross the sea, to Europe turn, Darkening the elements in their vast flight. Again the arrows fly and thro' the ranks, On either side scatter o'erwhelming fate. Then Valour lost her sons. Blow follow'd blow, So rapid, and 'mid such confusion rude, That, for the sire, the husband, and the child, One sigh sufficed. Now, nearer to the shore The barks advance, and as they closer draw, The mutual rage augments and fiercer still Javelin and dart are hurl'd. Llewellyn mark'd The stouter bark, well deeming Edward there, And to that spot he hied. The English King Beheld his rival. Both, a moment's space, Gazing upon his compeer, stood abash'd; So proud and princely, so august their port, That each for each felt reverence and an awe, That half unarm'd them. âEdward was a Prince of chiefe renowne, to whose heroicke mind God proportioned (as a most worthy mansion) a body answerable, so that as well in beauty and goodly presence, as in wisdome and valour, he was suitable to the height of his regall dignity, whose flourishing youth his destiny did exercise with many warres and troubles of the state, so to frame and fit him for the British Empire; which being King, he so managed with the glory of his Welsh and Northern victories, that by due desert hee is to bee reputed a chiefe honor of Britannie.â Camden. âEdward I. was born in Westminster. He was surnamed Longshanks, his step being another man's stride, being very high in stature. (Holinshed says he was first called Longshanks by the Scotch, in mockage, because he was a tall man. When his tomb was opened in the year 1770, he measured six feet two inches.) And though oftimes such who are built four stories high are observed to have little in their cockloft, yet was he a most judicious man in all his undertakings, equally wise to plot, as valiant to perform, happy in success, at Sea, at Land, at Home, Abroad, in War, in Peace. In a word, he was a Prince of so much merit, that nothing under a Chronicle can make his complete character.ââFuller's Worthies. Brief the pause. Both raise Aloft, their massy spears. Both send them forth To do no common deed. On Edward's helm Llewellyn's lance with crushing weight descends; The lion crest it shatter'd, then beneath, Alighted and sank deep. Edward the while Hurl'd his stout spear. Upon Llewellyn's shield, It fell, with force that shook his stable frame. One step he back retreated. Edward saw, And cried, âAdvance! Fearless attend your Prince!â He said and instant, o'er the foaming wave, Leap'd to the shore. His hosts, their gallant king, Follow, as thunder prompt. And now the beach, Far as the eye can strain, one lengthen'd scene Of strife displays!âDart passing dart on high, And sword and spear and axe, busy below! Brave men dealt fate around, 'mid uproar wild, And wounds of merciless severity; The stoutest falling, and by friend and foe Crush'd by the struggling foot, (that, like the wave, Pass'd to and fro) barb'd with the fang of death. Oh, Warriors, cease! Ye pitying powers above, Look down from your empyreal eminence! Stop the impetuous sword! Let not the shore, Still his voracious jaw open for blood! O, Mercy! Mercy! Whither hast thou stray'd? Upon the sounding shield the spear alights, The helmets clash;âthe sons of bravery Their utmost might strain in the furious fray, While hosts of dead and dying strew the shore! Unconscious of advancement or retreat, (As are the sea-encircled mariners, To ocean's ebb and flow,) both armies now, Far from the shore, stand on the level ground, And still the battle rages. Slow, at length The arm descends. Wearied and gorged with death, Alike Llewellyn and the English King Pause, and withdraw, awhile, each to prepare For fiercer war. Whatever man might do In the past fight, so sanguine and so fierce, Llewellyn did, but courage hath its bounds, And now he turns, and enters Conway's gate, Slow, sullen, like the lion, when he sees Hunter approaching, deeming it most wise, Till, to augment his power, David advanced, From his career of glory. Here he sped, Bearing his dead and dying from the field. Tho' cover'd with no mantle of disgrace, And tho' the enemy had felt his arm Fierce as the bellowing tempest, yet, to turn, From mortal man, and, for wise purposes, One moment stay the fight, Llewellyn's heart Grated, and he retired, scarcely upheld By the resolve, ere many hours should pass, Of kindling up vengeance' consuming fire. One thought Llewellyn's spirit filled with griefâ He found not Edward. Tho' among the fray He mix'd, the hottest fray, and where he strode, Laid low the mightiest, Edward was not there! England's high monarch, too, Llewellyn sought, But still his toil was vain. Inferior men, Fell fast before him, but the man of men He found not, tho' o'er all the field of blood, His eye impetuous roam'd. Many brave chiefs Had fall'n beside him in that fatal hour, And when he saw the Cambrians slacken'd arm, Their slow retiring march to Conway near, E'en Edward's heart felt joy, for such a day, The far-famed Conqueror of Palestine Never, till then, had seen. The foe retired, Edward his Chieftains call'd and thus began. âOn this hard day, our contest with the flood, âAnd raging waves, ere in the fight we strove, âRelax'd our might, and, for awhile, put off âThe hour of victory. To Conway's towers, âLlewellyn, with his host, fearful have fled. âWith the next rising sun, we will assail âYonder high battlements, and there aloud âShout, triumph! Veterans, yet prepare your hearts âFor fiercer strife. Fame shall erelong reward, âWith deathless laurels, England's valourous sons.â He ceas'd, while the approving shout ascends. As night advanced, Edward entrenched himself: And now, 'mid weary hours, whilst the torch gleam'd, Funereal, o'er the scene, obey'd the call Of sad humanity.âIt was a sight Might move a heart of stone, to see what forms, Ghastly, and wan, and wild, thither were brought. Some, as they reach'd the spot, breath'd out their last. Some struggled with a heart-corroding groan; Some, gently borne along, 'gainst their pierced sides, Their trembling fingers press'd, then holding out Faintly their hands, beheld, alas! too true, Death's bloody symbol! Some o'erwhelm'd with wounds, Scarce bearing evidence of human form, Thither were brought, so mangled, that the eye, Which chanced to spy them, pity most deserved. Ah, Latimer! Thou wast among the train. Thy squires conducted thee, from the red field, To place of safety, yet thou spakest not; Thou, who, for benefit, never withheldst Thro' a long life of gentle courtesy, The ready thanks, now from the field art borne, With toil, by those who love thee, yet thy voice Cheers not the toiler. As thou comest in Where aid awaits, a look of gratitude, Faint, but expressive, and well understood, Thy Squires receive.âThe blood, along the ground, Drops from thine armour! Tho' the pang severe Now on thy vitals preys, thou heed'st it not; The thought of homeâthe image of thy babes, No more to see their father! casts a film Over thy eye-ballâAh! The strife is o'er! The pang is past!âEarl Latimer expires! Here Audley too, upheld by friendly arm, Comes slowly, pale with blood in battle lost. He was a youth, of glory emulous, Panting for high renown. At Edward's voice, Calling each warrior to the Cambrian strife, Clad for the combat, spurning milder scenes, Audley arose. Wide were his father's lands;â Enwreath'd with honors, fighting for the cross, He died 'mid Palestine. All manly games, The bow, the race, the hawk, the tournament, Young Audley loved, and never a firmer spear Knighthood might boast, but at the voice of war, Like a true Patriot, sworn to valiant deeds, Forward the sprang. Bless'd with each earthly good, On him th' admiring eye, steadfastly gazed. Youth, wealth, and fame, were his, and lands far spread, Allied to Princedoms. Whoso him beheld, O'er his own sorrows, sighing sadly criedâ One man is happy! As he seized his lance, With the warm tear, his mother cried âFarewell! âMy joy, my hope, my solace, my support, âNext I shall meet thee in a better world.â Eager he sought the fight. High thoughts were his, Of what the Knight became, and his resolves Scarcely were bounded by mortality. 'Mid the late combat, Audley moved along, Impetuous, as the march of wintry floods, Daring all might. Three Cambrians, stout of limb, He slew, and onward still young Audley march'd, In the career of triumph, 'till, alas! Llewellyn found him. With one blow, his sword Sever'd his helm, and on his shoulder joint Alighting, from the trunk his arm half rent. He fell, and but for armour of steel-proof, Had perish'd, trodden to the glutted earth. Audley the King beheld, âBrave friend,â he cried, âI love thee for thy gallant father's sake. âTo have divided these thy bitter pangs, âI should have joy'd. Thou wilt survive to hurl âFury's mad dart, and tempests of disdain âUpon our foe. To save such men as thou, âI stay'd my ardent spirit in the fight, âAnd paus'd, ere I laid hold on victory.â Audley his bosom press'd, slow raising up His languid arm, but word he utter'd not. Ah! down he sinks, never to rise again! Lord Audley (or Aldithly, as it was often spelt) came into the possession of his large estates, including fifty-one manors, at an early age. He greatly signalised himself in the reign of Edward I. He was the object of general envy and admiration till he was slain in King Edward's wars with Llewellyn.âDugdale. From the soul-rending spectacle, the King Turn'd and some lenient object, earnest, sought To sooth his spirit. Vain desire! A sight, Charged with still deeper power to probe the heart, Now met his eye, from which he shrank aghast, The young Montalto! Breathless, he is borne, By Clifford's Earl, from the death-cover'd plain! The young Montalto was his father's joy, His monarch's hope, his country's confidence. When Edward to the Cambrian war advanced, Montalto, who ere this in distant lands, Had often wrested laurels from the brave, And knighthood gain'd by deeds of hardiment, Foremost appear'd to serve his gallant king. His father was a knight, known in past wars, Who led the valiant, none eclipsing him, Whilst his face show'd the honorable scar, Gain'd in his country's cause. He nobly fought, When the Third Henry met the Gallic Men, Across the seas, on Normandy's wide plains; There leaving monumental mounds, that told To distant warriors, trembling whilst they gaze, How England fought, and how their fathers fell. Here having shed, and oft, his valourous blood, And in Navarre, and where the Danah rolls His broad majestic billow to the sea, He now, in his old years, retired from strife, And on his son, just rising into prime, Bestow'd his sole solicitude. He cried, âI have fought hard for fame, yet, little more, âSave blows, not meekly falling, have I gain'd; âMy son a father's dreams shall realize.â And truly if aught human could sustain, Hope and high confidence, it was the youth Montalto, form'd in nature's fairest mould, And with a soul, the seat of courtesy, In whom all virtues centred as their home. Ideal lines and images, that haunt The sculptor's fancy, ere the statue breathe, That shall convey, down to the distant age, The master's moulding art, were dull and cold, To the concenter'd grace that charm'd all eyes In young Montalto. Tho', regardless he, In forming him, Nature herself surpass'd; Yet was his mind, that nobler part of man, More soaring, in the intellectual scale, Where spirits are contrasted. Generous, brave, Far from all sordid ends and little aims, He reach'd at eminence in noble things. True to his God, his Conscience, and his King. There was a Baron near his Sire's domain, Walter De Clifford. Lovely was the maid Who call'd him father; she from infancy Had with Montalto play'd; and when their years Wax'd nearer to maturity, their hearts, Unconscious, were united, for the youth, By imperceptible and slow degrees, Esteem'd Matilda, she Montalto prized. 'Twas when to join King Edward, in his wars Against the infidel, that first their love Rose into form and shape. Ere he set out, Strange thoughts arose. âWhat,â (to himself he cried) âIf when the hard-earn'd laurels should be won, âAnd homeward I return, what if these eyes âShould see Matilda grace another's side!â The miserable thought sent thro' his heart An icy pang. To shine in deeds of arms Was his ambition, and ere Edward sail'd Montalto, to Matilda hastening, cried, (Whilst the deep blush of feeling died his cheek) âFarewell, sweet maid! Joy, and all happiness, âBe thy rich portion 'till we meet again!â Matilda, 'till this hour, strove to believe, That she esteem'd him only, that, to prize Montalto's worth, was common to all hearts, Yet there was ever music in his voice, A mystic influence in the air he breath'd, A lulling tide of joy when he drew near, Silently flowing, and that ebbed alone, When the long-lengthen'd hour of parting came. Now as he cried âfarewell!â Deck'd for the war, And bent on dangerous enterprise remote, Her spirit sank within! She knew indeed, That friendship, admiration, high esteem, Were cold, to the warm current round her heart. She wept, but spake not. Bending at her feet, Montalto cried, (calling up all his strength To use the precious moment now possess'd,â Improved, or gone for ever.) âTo the wars, âIdol, and best-beloved of my soul! âBoth loyalty and honor call me forth. âFor thee alone I live. My heart will bear âThine impress, 'till we meet; and knighthood then, âWell-earned, shall make me worthy to look up, âAnd with the aspiring spirit think of thee!â One hand her eyes conceal'd, the other forth, Gently she stretch'd. Montalto seized the prize, He bore it to his lips, then cried, âfarewell!â Her true-love gone, Matilda, gentle maid, The tide of her affection turned toward one, Fairest of living things, a meek-eyed Dove Once fed by her Montalto, whilst to shew Reverence for all he prized, a Robin too She tended with affection, an old friend, That oft her lover mark'd, on the green tree, Or by the grotto, or the ivied cave, Sole sitting, while the evening sun declined. He was a truant bird, sometimes that came With constancyâwith most familiar looks, And fearless front, and then far off withdrew, Whither unknown, his absence mourn'd in vain. It was a winter's morn; the surly wind Shook the dismantled trees, and o'er the ground, In rustling noise, that silence made more plain, Like wave o'er wave, the red leaves blew along, When at her window, pleading in sad guise, The stranger stood. She could not chuse but sing. Sweet Robin, I hail thy appearance once more, Come sing in my garden, or peck at my door; Tho' an ingrate for favours, and often conferr'd, Matilda still welcomes her favorite bird. Thou remind'st me of one, in the wars far away, Who oft loiter'd to hear thy sweet song from the spray; Thou art dear, for thyself, as the Grot or the Cave, But thrice dearer to me for Montalto the brave. Of yore, when the tempest rush'd down from the sky, Thou oft cam'st to my window with pitiful eye; The bread from my table unsparing I cast, And thought that one Friend might be faithful at last. Thy contemplative look, 'twas my joy to behold, Thy quick-threaten'd leap and thy plumage of gold; And the oftener thou cam'st from thy dwelling unknown, The more welcome thou wast to the crumbs I had thrown. The mild breath of spring, from their covert profound, Call'd the leaves into light and bespangled the ground; Ah! then, 'mid the blaze of prosperity's reign, I sought for my Robin but sought him in vain! Now that summer is past and the forest is bare At my window thou stand'st, a sad spectacle there; Cold and shivering my pardon thou seem'st to implore, And to ask for the hand that once fed thee before. Come banish thy grief, nor past folly bewail, My love is a store-house that never shall fail; At evening, at morning, at noon, and at night, To feed my sweet Bird shall still give me delight. Thou wast once heard with pleasure and fed by his hand, Him, who now fights for fame, in a far distant land; Could not he, fickle roamer, thy gratitude bind? Hence! Seek some praise sweeter, some heart that's more kind! Ah! why should I thus thy inconstancy chide, Have I no conviction of crimes deeper dyed? Tho' of reason possess'd and Instruction Divine, My spirit is far more ungrateful than thine. From the moment since first I this vital air drew, One Friend has preserved and supported me too; Yet how often have I, whilst I sumptuously fared, Forgotten the Hand that my banquet prepared. The deep-toned trumpet speaks; at length is heard Shout of tumultuous joy. Matilda starts! She hears, amid a thousand jarring sounds, Montalto's name!âHe with his noble Prince, Back from the wars had come, with laurels deck'd, Chief of the Brave; and now with strenuous might Forcing the tardy door, the Knight rush'd in, Needing no voice of welcome. On he hies, Impetuous, at the feet of her he loved To lay his spoils, his honors, and his heart. As thro' the Village, arm in arm they stray'd, All eyes the beauteous pair watch'd and admired. The Plowman stopped his team, the digging Hind Lean'd on his spade, and ever as they pass'd, His toil forgot, and bless'd them, and from Heaven Sought cloudless skies and each felicity, For brave Montalto and the Maid he loved. In every movement, rapid or sedate, He, graceful as the dolphin, when he sports With wanton happiness upon the wave, Serene and clear, the flaming sun on high. She, as the full-blown rose, or, like the peach, Bursting with luscious ripeness, tho' with air, Modest, as that nocturnal flowret chaste Ceres, who shrinks from day's voluptuous stare, And to the eye alone of sober Night Her charms discloses. In the daring chase Montalto won renown, but other praise He heeded not; Matilda's voice alone When at her feet, the envied spoil he cast, Was his reward, her smile his recompence. At length the nuptial hour, nor far remote, Montalto ask'd. The maiden, silent, blush'd. Sceptres and diadems he envied not. Oft when the eve drew near, and silence reign'd, Faint, from De Clifford's Castle, might be hear'd The roaring of a cataract, far off, Embower'd in trees, that, from a rocky height, Pour'd its hoarse wave. This was their fairy ground. Before their hour of union, whilst the morn Scatter'd his clouds of fire, Montalto sent The Welcome Summons. An attempt has here been made, by a particular combination of sounds, to produce a few English stanzas, as soft or softer than the Italian. Come Matilda, blooming fair, Hear thine own Montalto call; With the Lark will we repair To the loud rough Waterfall. Who can view the woodbine wreathe, Lovely guardian, round the bower; Who the early perfume breathe, And not hail the balmy hour. Now wandering thro' the meadow wide, With the wood-note warbling loud; Now by the clear meandering tide, Gliding like a monarch proud. Oh! who can view the yellow corn, To the Reaper bending low, Or the ruby cloud of morn, Nor the grateful heart o'erflow! What with Nature may compare To awake the lofty thought? Nature ever new and fair, Now to pomp of glory wrought. Before the fervid noon-tide ray Mark the air with quiet deep; While yet the ruddy dawn delay, And with dew the flowret weep; All alone will we retreat, Far from every prying eye; And beguile the moment fleet With delightful colloquy. Come! improve the happy time, While we think, the whole may fade; In the morning hour of prime Come, Matilda, blooming Maid! Scarce had they now returned, joy in each heart, Anticipating happiness, when lo! On hurrying courser, at De Clifford's gate, A Herald stands, sounding his shrill horn loud. The Baron rushes forth. âWhat news?â he cried. âI come,â the Herald spake, âto summon thee, âInstant to join King Edward in his wars. âHe marches to subdue the Cambrian land.â âI follow,â said De Clifford. Back he hastes, And loud, âMontalto!â cried. He heard him not. Drinking Matilda's words, he listen'd, sad To hear the piteous tale, of valiant man Torn from the maid he loved and slain in fight. Again, in louder tone, De Clifford cries, âMontalto!â âHear'st thou not,â Matilda ask'd, âMy Father! Lo, he calls thee.â Up he sprang. He found the Baron. Thus De Clifford spake. âRejoice! good news is mine! Fame hath in store âCrowns for Montaltoâlaurels fresh and fair; âOur Monarch to the Cambrian warfare hastes! âI join him on the morrow. Well I know, âThou wilt be foremost when thy Country calls. âThe marriage-day put off, think now alone âOn war, and how to swell the blast of fame.â Montalto sigh'd. âNay, is thy spirit sad?â Exclaim'd De Clifford. âSighs befit thee not.â âI knew not that I sigh'd! Montalto spake. âYes! I am ready! I will lift my spear âAmong the foremost. Baron, to thy Child, âThe fair Matilda, hasten, and reveal âThese tidings of the war. Allay her fears. âCheer her with mildest words of tenderness. âTell her I go to gather fresh renown. âDe Clifford, we must part.â Montalto sped To seek his aged Sire, De Clifford turn'd, Solemnity within, to sooth the pang Matilda's heart might feel. The morn is come. Montalto's father, tho' in war grown old, Found, thro' the silent watches of the night, Sleep flee his pillow. As the dawn appear'd, He saw his son, trimming his helm and mail, In the reign of Henry I. a law past specifying the proportion and kinds of armour, which every knight was obliged to possess. The first enactment is the following. âWhosoever is possessed of one knight's fee shall have a coat of mail, and a helmet, and a shield, and a lance; and every knight shall have so many coats of mail, helmets, shields and lances, as he hath knights' fees in his estate.â Lyttleton's Henry II. And with forced smile bade him the morning cheer. âThank thee, my Father!â young Montalto cried. âNay, look not thus so sad. Thou should'st rejoice, âThat the new field is open'd for thy Son, âWhere he may reap honors of deathless name.â The aged Knight replied not, but his hand Extended to lace on the iron garb. âMy Son!â he said, ânever, till now, did war âStand plumeless and divested of all charms: âBut thro' my heart there steal, e'en at this hour, âSad creepings, and the thought foreboding ill. âI trust we yet shall meet.â âBest friend of earth!â Montalto cried, âthese cruel messengers, âThat sound alarm, shake scornful from thy heart. âDoubt not, we yet shall meet, and our wide hall âRing with loud shouts, when, to our list'ning friends, âI tell of our exploits, and how our arms âScatter'd the enemy. I yet shall stand âMore honor'd in my aged Father's sight, âWearing my hard-earn'd laurels. From thy mind âDismiss all thoughts, save joy and victory. âNow for my spear and helm!â Old Reginauld, Handed the helm, the spear he yet retain'd. âNow for my spear!â he cried. The aged man Answer'd. âMy Son, let it be mine awhile: âThou art not hors'd.â The neighing steed is heard. Montalto passes to the Castle Gate, Where his good Squire abode. Mounting, he cried, âFather, my lance.â The old man wiped his eye. âTake it, my Son,â he said. âHeaven be thy guide. âThou hast been dutiful and good to me. âI trust we yet shall meet.â The ardent grasp Now passes, whilst the war-horse paws the ground. âFarewell!â Montalto cried, âFather, farewell!â He answer'd not, and as the steeds proceed, Both wave their hands and both their faces hide. Montalto now enters De Clifford's gate. He seeks Matilda. On her couch she sat. She heard the well-known step. She raised her eyeâ The garb of war on her Montalto's form! It was a pang too keen. Downward she sank, Half senseless; her Montalto gently raised. âMy Love,â he cried, âwhence these tumultuous fears? âSoon will our noble Prince and his brave Host âScatter the Foe, when, on the wings of love, âI will return, and at Matilda's feet âLay all my honors.â Raising her sad eye, And with a tone of tenderness supreme, Matilda spake. âMontalto! for myself, âI have no care. Thou wrongest this my heart. âWhen for the chase thou hast prepared thyself, âHow often have I mourn'd, lest thou should'st meet âSome sore mischance, some lurking accident;â âNow to the chase of men, thou hastenest on;â âTo dangers and fierce perils and dismays! âWhat if some dart should wound Montalto's side! âThy blood be shed, and no Matilda near, âTo sooth thy pangsâto wipe thy pallid cheek, âAnd with affection's voice to comfort thee.â âOh! what if thou should'st die!â Montalto cried, Pressing the trembling Damsel to his heart, âMourn not for me. Within thy tender breast, âCherish no dark suspicions! Cease thy grief! âI, for brief absence, fighting for my King, âGrasping unfading honors, will repay âAll thy solicitudes, fairest of Maids, âBy a devoted life, to love and thee. âTrue are thy words. Oft hast thou caution given, âTo flee from danger, for thy sake and mine, âWhen in the ardent chase. Say, hast thou not âFull often welcom'd me, when the eve came, âAfter the hot pursuit? So shalt thou yet, âAfter a braver chase, Montalto hail. âFarewell, my Life, my Love! I will return âErelong, to shew thee that thy fears were vain.â The last embrace is pass'd. Montalto turnsâ He tears his spirit from the Maid he loves. A Father first to yield! A Lover next! And all uncertaintyâdarkness and mist! The burning tear and the distracting sigh Told of Matilda's anguish. On the couch, Senseless she lies. De Clifford waits below. His Squires are ready, whilst his Servants there Sorrowing appear, attention in their eye And silence roundâto see their Master mount; His grated helmet on, The number of bars to the helmet (according to Leigh and Guillim) was a point scrupulously regarded. All degrees of Nobility below a Duke, were restricted to four bars, whilst Dukes and Sovereign Princes were permitted to have seven. The present armorial law is, the King to have six bars: Dukes and Marquises five, and Viscounts and Barons four. In the strictest times of chivalry, the helmets of sovereigns were made of gold; those of Princes and Lords of silver; those of Knights, of steel adorned with silver; and those of Gentlemen of polished steel. Guillim, with rather a whimsical anticlimax, speaking of the front helmet worn by Sovereigns, says that âIt betokeneth authority and command, representing a kind of majesty, which property is observed to be naturally in the Frog, because, in his sitting, he holds his head steady, looking directly, in a kind of gravity of state.â in crimson robe Dress'd gorgeously, which (waving with the wind) Disclosed, beneath, the armour of sword proof; Whilst by his side appear'd, firm in their strength, Full many a steel-clad man, their spears upborne, Their mantles silver wrought, bearing the arms By valour nobly won. Montalto hastes! He mounts; and now upon the prancing steed, The trumpets sounding, he and Clifford's Lord Pass thro' the dark and hollow-sounding gate, Their Squires at hand, a goodly company. Whilst speeding on their way, all hearts combine, To pray for blessings on their noble Lord, And for Montalto, bravest among Knights, And for the Squires, all hastening to the wars. At Chester now arrived, Edward their King Welcomed them there. The Earl had been his friend, And young Montalto, on the Syrian shore, Had honors reap'd, and knighthood nobly won. âMontalto!â Edward cried, âThou shalt possess âOccasions of renown, dearer to thee âThan luxuries, and ease inglorious. âThou fightest for thy Country and thy King, âBoth grateful for the favours they receive.â Montalto blush'd and bow'd, pressing his heart. The days pass on and never a Knight was found More firm in peril, or more prompt to lead The daring enterprize. When Denbigh fell, He, with De Clifford and Lord Latimer, And Warren's Earl, strove who should second mount, After their King. Montalto won the prize; And nobler deeds than his, in the hard fight, That day display'd not. When at Conway's flood, Montalto, in the ship which Edward bore, Sailed, and to him the banner of the realm Edward confided. While the battle raged, Bold Anarawd, the Cambrian Chief, press'd on To seize the standard. Many a man he slew. Montalto saw him, like a mountain wolf, Advancing toward him. With a firmer grasp, His left hand held the staff, whilst, with the right, He raised his sword. Ah! In that luckless hour, Courage avail'd not! Nobly did'st thou fight, Gallant Montalto!âEvery nerve put forth, To save thy charge and thy high character!â Thou didst contend long time, e'en with the man, Who till that hour, his equal never found, But all thy skill is vainâMontalto falls! One blow his chest dissevers, whilst the blood, From the warm fountain of his heart, flows fast!â Amid the slaughter'd multitudeâhe falls! Bold Anarawd, the standard seizing, hastes Back, with his prize. Him Edward's eagle eye Glimps'd in the fight. He burst his ardent way, Toward the aggressor. Anarawd beheld, And now he meets his master in the fight. Stunned with the weight of Edward's massy axe, He falls, and whilst the Cambrians bear him thence, Edward, triumphant, grasps the banner'd staff, And, turning, scatters death and ruin round. The victory o'er, De Clifford look'd about, Eager to see Montalto. Oft his tongue Seem'd bold enough to ask for th' gallant youth, But gloomy thoughts arose. First, at that hour, He courage needed. In his heart he felt A coldness, kin to death. The field was near, But, with a ghastly dread, silent he stood, Irresolute. As evening slow advanced, And fear had now (no more with hope conjoin'd) Done the ungracious work of certainty, Calmly a knight drew near. Faultering he spake, âHe bravely fell.â No name De Clifford asked, No name was given. The Baron smote his breast. Tho' shivering with unutterable grief, Some gleam of even joy, rose in his heart, When doubt had vanish'd. On his manhood, now Firmly he call'd. Another soul was his. He hasten'd on, firm as a hill of stone, To the gore-cover'd plain. After long search, Among the dreary regions of the dead, Forcing the brand, and darting ghastly eye Into each countenance, beneath a heap Of bruis'd and lifeless warriors, he espied Montalto's helm! Trembling, he stands aloof, His spirit melting, and th' impetuous sigh Forcing rough way. Further he fear'd to look. Montalto's self his soul had shaken less, Than this well-known and blood-cemented casque, That told its owner near. Still he goes on, Solemn and slow. Ah! Now he sees his face! A heart-consuming pang rush'd thro' his breast. One effort more. Moving th' obstructing corse, He drags him forth, mangled and stiff and cold! No word is spoken. Motion there is none.â (Save some unnoticed man, among the slain, Lifting his arm, in the agonies of death.) Upon the close-lock'd shield, limbs hanging down, Montalto now is borne, with strenuous toil, To the near camp, the drowsy torch before; Whilst they who share the burden, with their Chief, Silent move on, oft wiping the sad tear. His sire, no more, shall see Montalto's face! Anguish shall pierce his spirit, and deep sighs Wear out the frame of the grief-stricken man, Till he shall sink, at last, into his grave, Crying, âMontalto!â To deplore her loss, No mother lives to mourn, yet one survives To bear thro' life the beating surge of woeâ The maid, Matilda! She shall long inquire, From each she meets, âWhat tidings of the war, âAnd of Montalto?â till at length, her ears, What her foreboding heart before had told, Shall listen to the praise of one no more! All mourn'd Montalto! Edward hasten'd nigh To see so fair a flower, cropt in the bud! And when the bloody helm and garb he saw! The face that was Montalto, dark in death, All bruis'd and mangled! When he saw the orb, Thro' which the high and generous spirit beam'dâ Dull, motionless! The lips of ruby hue, On which sat eloquence, for ever closed! The limbs, late active, cold and motionless! He sigh'd and said. âThou wast a gallant Knight, âThe hope of England and thy Monarch's pride! âMy soul is sad. My brother and my friend! âThy memory will be dear! I must away! âIt is a sight too potent for my heart. âFarewell brave youth! A last and long farewell!â Not so De Clifford fled. Grief, o'er his limbs, Had thrown a statue stiffness. Down he look'd On his compeer in glory, late his pride, Now lifeless, and as thus the Baron gazed, With steadfast eye, each hand in th' other clench'd, Whilst the big tear rolled glistening down his cheek, Earl Warren with the soothing voice drew nigh; âBrave Earl,â he said, âWith this intemperate grief, âMourn not the dead. Montalto bravely fell, âAnd praises follow him. His country's cause âThe youth upheld, with courage, not surpass'd âIn the long list of glory. Thus to die, âEnvy we may, but we must not deplore.â De Clifford cried. âWarren! A loss like mine âWords may not tell. O! He was excellent âIn all ennobling views and princely ways. âHis form was majesty, stripped of its dread, âBy the sweet winning robeâhumility, âHis look was kindness, and mild sympathy; âHis voice like music stole into the heart, âWhilst his pure mind, young as he was became âThe source and concentration of great thoughts, âThe confluence, the rich receptacle âOf all which fallen nature dignifies, âThence drawn, his Maker's Will, which to perform, âIs virtue, all beside but semblance fair. âThis was Montalto, this the youth I mourn. âSelf, bane of earth and earthly happiness, âHe had subdued. His was another's care; âHis joy was to behold another smile, âTo sooth the voice of anguish, to seek out âAll means and modes of doing noble things, âWith a benevolent alacrity, âThrice heighten'd by the manner: must I not âA friend so tried, a loss so great deplore? âWhene'er he spake, in the admiring breast, âKindly regards, fraternal feelings rose. âHe left not to the Stranger even to choose. âYon Squire who silent stands, and weeps unseen, âHe knew him well. To know and not to love âThat were impossible! Dear gallant Youth, âThus early call'd from thy career of praise, âFair was thy bloom, rich harvests promising âOf future fame, but, in disastrous hour, âThee War hath visited! Thy race is run! âThy long farewell is bid to mortal scenes! âIf worth could screen, if tears and sighs could save, âThou hadst not to thy death-bed thus have gone! âOh! How shall I resign thee, how repress âRebellious anguish, pangs that will have vent? âA son were not more dear. Ah! There is one âWhose pungency of suffering will surpass âAll I endure. The partner, once so prized, âShe rests on earth! Two sons, for glory made, âThey lie 'mid Palestine! A daughter, too, âLoving and loved, early to death went down, âAnd she who should have been my joy in age, âOn whom my fond hopes rested, whom my eyes, âNever beheld, but blessings, from my heart, âSpontaneous rose, tidings for her await âWhich will the rose-bud from her lily cheek, âHarshly remove, and she will pine and die! âO Warren! If affection true thou feel, âFor one so wretched, late so bless'd, defer âAll consolations which thy love might prompt, âTill times remote, and leave me now alone, âTo silence, and the wormwood of the heart.â BOOK XXI. SCENE, Conway Castle. When to contend with England's warrior sons, From Conway's towers, Llewellyn, with his host, Undaunted sped; Vychan, to mark the fight, Ascended the tall battlements, when lo! The strife beneath wax'd hot. He saw a man, Clad in close armour, with surpassing strength, A Saxon beat to earth, another foe, Another, and another cameâto die! All eyes the stranger bless'd and of his sword Spake rapturously. Vychan transported cried, âThou might'st be own'd of Arthur. On thy name âOur race shall hang!â Ah! Two vindictive men Surround the Cambrian! Blow for blow is given Furious and hard, and doubtful is the fight. A third advances! Lo!âThe hero falls! Oppress'd with wounds and honors, on the groundâ On men whom he had slain, lifeless he falls! In agony of grief, Vychan beheld. âGo forthâ he cried, âand from the field of death âYon slaughter'd man, unknown, bear to our sight. âHis name, his deeds, the future Bard shall praise.â They usher forth, 'mid the conflicting spear, And bear, at length, the brave man from the field. Vychan, the tear fast falling from his eye, Feebly exclaim'd, âUnrobe the noble dead!â His armour they cast off; his helm they raiseâ Vychan his hands clasp'd hard! All look'd at him, With silent earnestness, waiting his words. âIt is my Son!â he said, and sunk, and died! Montaigne, in one of his Essays, enumerates various instances of the fatal effects that have taken place from the excess of joy and sorrow, one of which bears some resemblance to the preceding. Walwyn, before the fight, at Conway's gate Stood waiting for his Prince. Vychan drew near. Slowly he cried, âI, from these battlements, âShall mark the fight; my Son, one prayer is mine. âThrow off that armour. Choose some strange attire, âUnknown of me, so when the combat warms, âI may not say, out in the thickest strife, âI see my Son! Perils encompass him! âNor I the power to succour.â Walwyn cried, âParent revered! My garb thou shalt not know. âNow fare thee well. I am thy Son, a thought âThat shall give vigour to this arm of steel.â When Walwyn fell, his country, to her base, Trembled, for he was one, whom any land, Ill might resign, when warfare's voice was heard: For he was wise and brave, and on his might, Cambria half-lean'd. His youth had been renown'd For vigorous shoots, which in maturity Promised rich fruit; and his surpassing might, And wisdom, in nice circumstance, where minds Sage, might to error lean, brave Walwyn raised Both in Llewellyn and his Country's sight, To loftiest eminence. When Cambria's Prince Doubted, in moment intricate, he cried, Whate'er the occasion, âWalwyn, guide our thoughts. âWhat says our Counsellor!â In perilous hour, At Menai's flood, when the proud Gascon Lords Ventured, with glittering lance and burnish'd mail, Supported by the flower of Edward's might, To rest on Cambria, Walwyn, spirit bold, Met them, and in the memorable fray, Laid low their heads, while Nevill and Lord Strange, And stout De Tanye, vanquish'd, in that day, For ever closed their eyes. When Cambria call'd, Walwyn uprose and hasten'd to the war. He left a house, a home, warm and endeared; He left a fair domain; he left a Wife Chaste as the eve, and lovely as the moon Wandering among her stars; he left a Child That just could say âMy Father!â and his knee, Labouring, ascend, to kiss the fondling Sire, Melting with happiness, at the soft touch, And the sweet voice, harmonious, of his Boy!â Thrice dearer than all other things that were. The place that knew him once, never again Shall see its Master! Never shall the Wife Smile at his step approaching, and again In gentle tone upbraid his long delay! The Child shall cry, âMy Father!â and inquire, âWhy weepest thou?â to her who brought him forth. Of all who died upon this bloody day, 'Mong Cambria's sons, Walwyn the only chief, The rest, tho' brave, prompt in the bold exploit, And truly mourn'd in the great scale of things, Were common spirits; men, of whom their chiefs Knew this alone, that Cambria gave them birth; But, from what parts they came, or north, or south, Whether their home was seated on the hill, Or in the vale, or by the mountain stream, Little they knew; neither what ties they had, To bind their hearts to this terrestrial sphere; All was uncertain, but their bravery Their chiefs admired, and, grateful for their worth, Now that the scythe of war had levelled them, Delved, 'neath the earth, a peaceful resting-place, And o'er them heaved the sigh. Nor told they not, (Tho' faint, and well suspecting what they said,) Of the Immortal Fabric they had rear'd, Offering of Fame to Valour!âwhilst they speak E'en in that very hour, Oblivion waits, Impatient of the earth, o'er them to cast His mantle of forgetfulness. Not they Who knew and prized and sent them to the war, So soon shall blot them from their memory! Not from the clouds they fell; each had his friends. The aged Sire shall mourn his long-lost Son; The Brother Brother yield, not without tears; The Orphan, sad and destitute, bewail The kind Protector of his Infancy: The Mother weep, when thinking of her Child, Scarce solaced, with the thought, that he put forth His hand, to take the sword, not willingly, But, forced by honor and the patriot's zeal;â That, when he fell, he fell that those might live, And welcome life, and feel it a rich boon, Who were, to him, dearer than life itself. A sad and mournful residue remains, A lonely host, heaving the ceaseless sigh, Who would e'en joy to know that they were dead, Whom once they prized; that privilege denied, The fear, the hope, still hovers round their heart, That they may yet survive, circled by foes, Some wretched prisoners, and at hour unlook'd, Rush thro' the door, with speechless ecstasy And with wide arms, clasping each friend they meet; Then thinking of the Aged; looking round, Longing to hear them! fearing to inquire! All precious to their hearts! Even hope itself Poisons the spirit with its long delay. Humbler in sorrow, they require alone Some certainty, on which their souls might rest! Ah, vain desire! you to your graves shall go, (Thro' life the alternate prey of hope and fear, Each parching up the mind, with heat and cold, Alternate and extreme,) and meet at length In th' unseen world, those whom you sought on earthâ Who fell amid th' unheeded multitude!â Now had Llewellyn and the Cambrian host Thro' Conway's gates pass'd, and a mournful train Of dead and dying. Theirs was not defeat, Yet every heart felt it not victory; Kin to discomfiture; and on they pass'd, Nor sad, nor yet rejoicing. One high thought Had cheer'd Llewellyn: he that day had hoped, Before the eve, to whelm the English force In utter shame, but now he saw the hour Put off, and other scenes of war arise. One to Llewellyn hastes; sorrowing he told Of Walwyn and his Sire, Vychan the brave. In silent grief the news Llewellyn heard. Whilst the tall tree waved slowly to and fro, Then paused and waved again, Llewellyn stood, Yet word he utter'd not, deep silence round. At length he cried, âStupendous scenes unfold. âThe future must be ours.â He strove to rouse, By words of fire, fresh vigour in each nerve, But the warm tear would fall. At length he cried, âNow other views and other thoughts are ours.â It was the noon of night, when Cambria's Prince Called faithful Heralds. To the first he cried, âDavid our Brother seek! Tell him our Foe âHath o'er the Conway forced his daring way, âAnd we are here. Warn him, with rapid step, âTo speed with his victorious men at arms; âPerchance his aid may serve us. Faithful man, âNo moment lose.â The second waiting stood. Llewellyn spake. âHaste thou to Powis-land! âCall thou Rhywaldon, with his warriors bold!â And to the third he cried, âSpeed to the south! âBear this my solemn threat. Each man who shuns âInstant to join our forces, and delays âWhate'er the cause) his service in the war, âI do pronounce him traitor! He, his lands, âHis life, shall forfeit to his country's wrath. âSpeed! Answer not!â The heralds have pass'd on. Now, to his chiefs, Llewellyn thus began. âPrepare for contest! With the earliest dawn, âWe will renew the fight. Upon yon plain, âWarfare again shall rage, and I will tear âThe unsteady laurel from King Edward's brow.â Joy swims in every eye, each now prepares, With glowing heart, for the approaching hour. The faint dawn glimmers in the eastern sky. Llewellyn and his chiefs now are prepared Thro' the broad gate to rush and meet the foe.â One fast advances. Trembling he exclaims, âThe English force now hasten toward our walls. âThey meditate the storm!â Llewellyn cried, âI fear'd not Edward in the open field, âHere I disdain him. Flee ye to your posts! âThe vantage ground is ours. Cambrians, rejoice!â The rampart now is crowded, and the dart, Javelin and spear, pause ere the deathful flight. Edward and his brave forces, resolute, Now have advanced beneath the coping walls. Edward exclaims, âThe Ladders!â At the word, Confusion, like a tempest, follows on.â Ah, deathful sight! Ye mothers of the land, Weep for your children! Havoc is let loose! Darts, javelins, spears, with the discordant din Of clashing shields, and bucklers, sounding loud, Burden the airâeach moment of suspense, Fill'd with the fearful sighs and hollow groans, Of warrior, gash'd and dying. 'Neath the wall Hosts welter in their gore, and momently, From the throng'd ladders, thick as falling hail, Others descend, to the Aceldama, Sanguine, beneath. Ah! whence that sudden shout!â It comes from the exulting Cambrians high. Edward, the bold! the brave Plantagenet!â Llewellyn, with a blow of matchless might, Beat, from the loftiest battlements! He fallsâ Headlong! A man beneath beheld his Prince, Young Cavendish, a Knight of high renown: With open arms he catches him! He saves From sudden death, by strenuous might put forth, The pride of Kings! the flower of Chivalry!â But, in th' heroic deed, his eyes are closed, And never more the light shall visit them! The trumpet sounds retreat. Th' assailants haste Fast from the work of death. The Camp they reach. Scarce would the eye be satisfied, the heart Allay its throbbings, when the English host, Unhurt, beheld their King. Each Earl and Knight, Required some stronger evidence than sense. Voice, looks, assurance, these, in common case, Might deal conviction, but suspicion's flame, Time only could extinguish and wear out, Into full certainty. Edward, at length, Exclaim'd, âBrave Men! For your solicitude, âYour Monarch thanks you. This your loyalty âIs written on the tablet of his heart, âIndelible. Our ardour hath sustain'd âA check, a transient pause. Few hours shall wane, âYea, by St. George, upon the coming morn, âWe will renew th' assault. I, on that Prince, âLlewellyn, wrath, accumulated wrath, âWill pour, that shall consume him. Twice his arm âHath barr'd my road to fame. One sun, erelong, âShall cease to light us both, nor both alike âBreathe in one common atmosphere. These men, â(Indulge your Prince with the attentive ear) âThese men, these Cambrians, naught on earth may stay. âThey fight with fury, kin to the fierce wolves, âThat, starving, issue from their dens of ice, âUp 'mid the mountains and the roaring pines, âSweeping the campaigns. To fulfil the dreams âThat haunt my midnight pillow, I had hoped, â(Bounding the warmest passion of my soul) âWhen Cambria, if that hour should e'er arrive, âHath fallen, toward the Northern Sons of War,â âThe Caledonian, to direct my march, âThat Britain, in her proud supremacy, âMight own one monarch; thus with stately march, âExalting Albion, to the pinnacle âOf mortal glory. It seems to have been a commanding object with Edward thro' life, to unite the whole of Britain under one Monarch, and this wish does not appear to have originated in ambition, but from a calm conviction that such a measure (effected under a favourable conjuncture of circumstances, such as manifestly existed in his day) would most decisively tend to the advantage of the whole community. âThere are two cases in which the extension of territory may be of real advantage, and to both parties. The first is, where an empire thereby reaches to the natural boundaries which divide it from the rest of the world. Thus we account the British Channel the natural boundary which separates the nations of England and France: and if France possessed any counties on this, or England any cities or provinces on that side of the sea, the recovery of such towns and districts to what may be called their natural sovereign, though it may not be a just reason for commencing war, would be a proper use to make of victory. The other case is, where neighbouring states, being severally too small and weak to defend themselves against the dangers that surround them, can only be safe by a strict and constant junction of their strength: here conquest will effect the purposes of confederation and alliance; and the union which it produces is often more close and permanent, than that which results from voluntary association. Thus, if the Heptarchy had continued in England, the different kingdoms of it might have separately fallen a prey to foreign invasion; and although the interest and danger of one part of the island were in truth common to every other part, it might have been difficult to have circulated this persuasion amongst independent nations; or to have united them in any regular or steady opposition to their continental enemies, had not the valour and fortune of an enterprising prince incorporated the whole into a single monarchy.âPaley. Warriors, dear to fame, âIf like the Cambrian, the brave Scot should fight, âWith such o'erwhelming vehemence of soul, âTho' scared not with the prospect and rough road, âOur laurels will be bought, with sacrifice âAppalling, save to spirits such as ours. The anticipation here expressed of subduing Scotland, Edward afterwards effected, stimulated partly, it may be, to a measure of such general utility, by the premature death of Alexander, and the distracted state of Scotland, arising from the different competitors for the vacant throne. Edward would have exhibited a reverence for abstract justice too refined for his age, if he had remained a passive spectator of these conflicts without improving the conjuncture for the political interests of his own subjects. When Bruce subsequently revolted, Edward (tho' sixty-eight) marched with a large army to reduce his refractory opponent. It was on this expedition that Edward died. Sir Joseph Ayloffe, states that the King on his death bed, enjoined on the Earls of Northumberland, Pembroke, Lincoln, and the Lord Clifford, that they should acquaint his Son that it was his dying command, âthat his heart should be sent to the Holy Land, attended by one hundred and forty knights, and that his corpse should be carried in the van of the army till Scotland was completely subdued.â It does not appear that Edward's request was complied with, of transporting his heart to the Holy Land, but such an instance did occur in the year 1328. Alexander Nisbet mentions that one of the Douglas family was sent in that year to Palestine, with the heart of Robert Bruce King of Scotland. It is perhaps from this circumstance that the arms of the Douglas family are, Argent, a human heart imperially crowned, proper; on a chief azure, three mullets of the field. From some ancient and obscure references, the opinion had prevailed that a curious process had been adopted for preserving the body of Edward. Under this impression the Hon. Danies Barrington, in the year 1770, obtained permission from the Dean of Westminster to open King Edward's tomb, to ascertain the fact, which he accordingly did, but without finding the expectation of embalment realized. A curious account of this transaction will be found in the 3d vol. of the Archaiologia. âLeaving the future to such new resolves, âAs wisdom may prescribe, the present now âClaims our austere observances. Prepare! âOn the next morn, triumph or death be ours.â Now Sepulture, that follows on War's steps, Steady as shadow round the steeple tower, Brav'ry again resorts to with a sigh. The Earth, that but few hours repose hath known, Is waked from her short slumbers, to receive New visitants! The mattock sounds aloud! The burden'd shovel sends its load of clay Up from beneath! the spacious chasm is form'd, Long, deep, and dark! The Dead are handed down, Arms upward thrust to break the heavy fall! And side by side they lie, never again To gaze upon the sun-beam and feel life Mantling in every vein!âEdward exclaim'd, As the brave Cavendish now was interred, âI am afflicted and my heart is sad, âTo think no noble honors may be paid âTo him who saved my life and lost his own! âThou young and noble Knight, a foreign land âThy bones must sanctify, and he whose heart, âTo honor thy remains, gladly would call âInvention and the cunning man's device, âFar from his home, must to the earth consign âWhat once was thou, with no peculiar marks âOf heart munificence. Yet will I hold, âSacred, thy memory, and when I reach âThe land of my nativity, a shrine, âLofty and proud, shall speak thy monarch's praise.â A greater diversity in the character given to the dead, has seldom appeared than in the following two epitaphs on Llewellyn, each impregnated with the soil through which the stream passed. Epitaph on Llewellyn, by a Welsh âMetritien,â thus anciently englished: Of Englishmen the scourge, of Welsh the protector, Llewellyn the Prince, rule of all virtue, Gemme of Livers, and of all others the flower; Who unto death, hath paid his debt due, Of Kings a mirror that after him ensue, Duke and Priest, and of the law the right, Here, in this Grave, of people, lieth the light. This praise having been deemed misplaced by an old English Poet, he Wrote the following as a substitute: Here lyeth of errour, the Prince if ye will ken: Thiefe &amp; Robber &amp; Traytor to Englishmen, A dimme brood, a sect of doers evill; God of Welshmen, cruel without skill, In slaying the good, and Leader of the bad: Lastly rewarded as he deserved had: Of Trojans blood the dregs, and not the seed; A root of falshood, and cause of many evill deed. The king, the gazers, and the men below, Who cross'd his legs, the Knight of Palestine, Knights who had visited the Holy Land were buried with one leg resting on the other. The images on their tombs exhibit the same peculiarity. Those in the Rotundo of the Temple Church, London, are well known. And 'neath his head, the green sod gently placed, Shed tears, and ere they left him, sigh'd and said, âHe was a noble knight, rest to his soul!â Whilst Edward praised the dead, down Conway's stream A gallant fleet advances with the wind. The sails are fill'd, and steadily they pass, The streamers curling o'er the sportive wave. Talbot and Venables there hasten on! And now the ships are moor'd. The Leaders leap Impatient to the strand, and eager seek Edward, who waits to learn the news they bear. Talbot advances. Thus aloud he cries. âMona is fallen! That noble Isle is ours! âWe came, we conquer'd! All the Cambrian strength, âAnd great it was, fled with wild vehemence, âBefore our victor spears invincible!â The King exclaim'd, âBrave Earl, thou hast my praise.â Talbot replied, âYet tidings still remain, âThat will thine indignation to a flame âRaise, and stir up the spirit of revenge. âDavid! the Cambrian Prince, whom thou didst send âTo aid, not doubting his sincerity, âThe cause, that needed not such force as his, âHath proved a Traitor! He from Mona's isle, âFled to Llewellyn with our thoughts and plans, âYet, we were brave without him.â Edward cried, âThat man will I consume! Thou hypocrite! âThou Lamia, with fair look, but foul of heart, âThou shalt sustain the tempest of my wrath! âThe oath is past. My soul hath sanctioned it.â âNever again will I confide in one, âWho doth his country with fair speech renounce. âThe ground is hollow. Tho' he be sincere, â(Scarce possible) a lingering love within, âHangs round his heart. The land that gave him birth âPleads, eloquent, e'en in the silent night, âTill, with affection full and love supreme, âNo more to be repress'd, aloud he cries, ââMy Country!ââDavid! if the wars should give âThee, to my spoilâthe King whom thou hast scorn'd, âUpon his promise trampled, and his faith, âWith wanton sport betray'd, shall on thee light âWith fangs of lightning, which shall sink thee down, âUnwept, to endless infamy and death. âThis oath I swear! Hear it, ye Veterans round. âSay, Venables, what more of thy exploits.â Thus Venables replied. âFrom Mona's Isle âSpeeding triumphant, ere we Conway reach'd, âBy adverse winds, near to Caer-Sion driven, âA bold exploit rush'd thro' our ardent mind. âWe turn'd our gallant prows against her towers. âWe landed and that Castle stoops to thee. âResistance we had hoped, but th' Cambrian men, âWho long erected there the Lion staff, â(The treble Lion, on the field of gold The arms of North Wales were, as claimed by Gryffyd ap Cynan, in the 12th century, Gules, three lions passant argent. Although some heralds say that it was Lion rampant or, in a field gules, while others state it to be, Or three lions passant, proper. Owen Gwynedd, the son and successor of the above Gryffyd, used, as his arms, (for a reason which I have not been able to ascertain) Vert, three eagles displayed in fess, or, and these arms are still retained by the respectable family of the Wynns of North Wales, who have the honor of being the lineal descendants of the Princes of North Wales.) âHad pass'd to Conway, at Llewellyn's call, âThere to meet Edward's arm. At our approach âSome slender band escaped, and as we reach'd âThe high-arch'd gateway, from their secret cells, âOut-pour'd a hundred Monks. Chanting they came, âBurden'd with relics, waving wide the cross. âThe first I spear'd. The rest impetuous fled.â âA brave exploit!â cried Edward. Venables Again his speech pursued. âThere is untold, âA small affairâa circumstance minute, âScarce worth the toil of naming. Mona's Isle, âAfter a fight, hard and most obstinate, âThus falling to our King, 'mid captive hosts, âWe found that chanting, harping tribe, height Bards, âWho, on some solemn day, thither had sped âFrom Cambria's utmost bound, contests to hold âUpon the harp, which ever to mine ear, âWith music in all forms, grating hath been. âYet my dislike I had repress'd, and shewn âSilent contempt for these rude sons of song, âHad I not known, that men, whose outward form âSeem'd innocent, oft treasured in their hearts, âSeditions and the foulest purposes. âTheir songs have magic power. They stir the minds, âOf those who hear them, up to frantic deeds. âE'en I have listen'd, sober as I am, âTo their wild strains, till my disdainful soul âHath meditated high exploits, and long'd âTo wake the raging spirit of the blast, âAnd tear some monarch from his tottering throne. âWe knew that thou wouldst never peaceably âPossess this land, whilst these wild harpers told âOf feats and heroes in the days gone by, âKindling in every heart, intenser love âOf Cambria and of fame. It was an hour, âMost precious for some signal enterprise, âNot to be slighted. Here they all were met.â âSpeak!â Edward cried. Thus Venables pursued. âIn Mona's island, Cambria's Bards were met, âThe turmoils and the troublers of the state. âWith one congenial and approving mind, âTalbot and I resolvedâthro' Policy, âThe clue alone which must all states direct, âTo offer themâthese refuse of mankind, âUpon the altar of our country's good. âOne, only one survived, all else were slain.â âBlood! Thunder!â Edward cried, âThis small affair,â âIs coupled with destruction!â Talbot spake. âI do applaud the rigour of thy soul. âThis man, my late coadjutor, hath lied! âThe thing was his! The murder on his head âRests only. I protested 'gainst the deed, âBut his insatiate thirst of blood prevail'd! âI like him not. He is a foreign breedâ âUntrue, disloyal, a most bloody man! âThe air he breathes pollutes our atmosphere!â Astounded, Venables exclaim'd, âO King! âBy Heaven above, it was our mutual act. âI least approved, Earl Talbot urged me on. âI paused, tho' I believed it policy, âBut Talbot shouted, âDeath!â âThou liest, O man!â Talbot replied. âI told thee that our King, âWhose heart was human, kind and merciful, âForm'd in humanity's most tender mould, âKin to the angel, would resent and pour, âVengeance upon thy head, for such a deed âOf matchless cruelty.â Edward exclaim'd, âUpon yon sturdy tree, this Venables âHang instant. Justice to our spotless land, âTo me, to Cambria, all require his death. âThere let him learn, that Policy, alone, âIs, to do Right! Mercy and truth, to seek, âAnd naked equity, which, high and low â(Upraised above folly-engender'd mists, âAnd, in the end, the test alone of good) âWill find their choicest interest, form'd alike âFor thrones and potentates, nobles and slaves! âNo answer, thou bleak-hearted murderer! âOne life but ill atones for crimes like thine.â The secret dagger drawn, Venables aims A deadly blow at Talbot. Vain his rage. Wailing and frantic, he is borne away. With more than woman's fears, still gazing back, âPardon!â aloud he cries, âMercy! O King!â E'en Mercy, at his voice, rolls round her garb, And from her eye shoots momentary scorn. Ah! there he hangs, whilst the loud shout prevails! Earl Talbot, pale and trembling, silent stands. Turning, thus Edward spake. âThy hollow speech, âBabes only might mislead. That English Earl, âThat one who first inhaled our balmy air, âUpon whose eye Nature's divinest forms, âFrom infancy reposed; that one, like thee, âNurtured and fed, 'mid kindliest charities, âAnd where Humanity holds her high seat, âCongenial with the soil; that thou should'st spurn âHer gentle whispers, and the voice disdain âOf Heaven's most Holy Word, wherein we learn, âOur duty to the stranger and forlorn, âAnd blend our tears with th' Good Samaritan;â âNot like to thee: Talbot! that thou should'st spurn âThese mild-eyed monitors, and steel thy heart âThus to approve, or, with surpassing guilt, âTamely oppose, so foul and dark a deed, âAfflicts my spirit. Tarnish'd with such crimes, âFrom thy high pinnacle, headlong thou sink'st, âEven like the leaf, which never falls but once, âGone irretrievably! Talbot! no more âShall Edward call thee friend. Thou art henceforth âStripp'd of thy honors. The depriving a Knight of his honors, was attended with great ceremony. âSir Ralph Grey, in the second year of Edward IV. was degraded of the high order of Knighthode, at Doncastre, by cuttyng of his gylt Sporres, rentyng his Cote of armes, and breaking his sword over his hed.ââHall. Off! Thy sight to me âIs hateful as Apollyon! At the core âThy heart is wither'd. Strive to quench thy shame. âAspire, with all thy best solicitudes, âSweet peace to find, yet know thou evil man! âThere is a weight in blood, a ponderous weight, âThat will pull down the mightiest, and a stain, âWhich all the ocean waves shall never cleanse!â Earl Talbot turned. He sought the neighbouring shore, And in a boat, lonely, slow sail'd away Toward the wide sea. He had a worm within, A ravenous worm, feeding upon his heart.â The boat in which he sails, amid the flood, Pauses. Earl Talbot rises from his seat, Wringing his hands. He thinks upon his shame, His every hope, wither'd, of wealth and power;â His Monarch's scorn, and, something of remorse, For the fell deedâthe blood of Cambria's Bards Slain in the hour of prayer! rose in his mind; Alone, unheeded, but conjoin'd with thoughts Of hopeless fortune, not to be endured. The tumult of his spirit, teems afresh, And higher. 'Mid th' intolerable pang, From the deep-hidden sheath, a dagger, slow, He draws, and in a phrensying fit, the steel Sends sudden to his heart. The wave Swallows him up, and his dishonor'd corse Bears off, on which the glutted Porpoise feeds!â Edward beheld him. âRighteous Heaven,â he cried, âWith hand retributive hath follow'd him! âHe slew the Bards of Mona! Peaceful men! âThe murderer, by his own uplifted hand, âHath perish'd! Be his name scorn'd of the base!â âNow,â Edward cried, âwith this victorious host âSwelling our ranks, success must crown our toil. âThe day is far advanced. When the dawn bursts, âOnce more will we assail yon battlements.â The night, with clouds came on. The embryo storm Sat in the firmament, and the huge waves Came foaming to the shore. A ship appears, In the far distance, out amid the sea, Hard press'd, and striving with the wrathful surge; Borne furious, by the eastern blast along. Edward exclaim'd. âWe leave her to her fate âNo might is ours.â Yet still, with sadden'd brow, He mark'd the conflict. Fast the lowering mists Gather thro' all the firmament, and night Now all things hides. Tho' great events were near, The King his spirit felt, ardently turn'd Toward the poor mariner, by storms and clouds, By dangers thus involved, perchance and death. The King communing with his chieftains stands, When a brave Knight advanced, leading a man, Bald-headed, with a beard, flowing and white, Whilst o'er his shoulders, a huge harp was thrown. The Knight began. âWhilst venturing from yon towers, âCaer-Sion named, pacing the craggy strand, âI mark'd a toiling ship, buffeting hard âWith the stupendous surge. The eve came on, âAnd dreadful was the conflict of the skies. âAgainst the rocky shore, near and more near, âThe bark advanced; at length, a mountain wave âToss'd her upon the dark and frowning crags! âEre day retired, and whilst the bark upheld, âNobly, her head, against th' inclement wave, âBeneath a rock, outstretch'd, amid the surge, âI spied this stranger-man, eyeing the scene; âAnd when the strife was o'er, approaching him, âI ask'd his name. âI am a Bard.â He cried. ââMy name is Lhyrarch. Late from Conway's towers, âWistless of all things but the daring thought; âInticed by the serenity of Heaven, âLonely I paced this strand, drinking my fill âOf holy influence, caught from sea and earth, âAnd the munificence of setting suns.â âI understood him not. Jargon to me; âBut finding him, a Cambrian and a foe, âI bore him here, that thou might'st speak his doom.â Edward replied, turning to Lhyrarch nigh, Who silent stood. âSage man, I honor thee! âI love the music of the tuneful lyre, Hector Boethius, in his history of Scotland, says that Edward I carried Robert Baston, a poet, with him into Scotland, that he might celebrate his victories in verse, which he accordingly did âto great admiration.â Robert Baston was a Carmelite Friar of Scarborough. Wharton says that he also accompanied Edward II. on his expedition into Scotland, to immortalize his victories, but being by some means taken prisoner, and the Scots having unfortunately learned his profession and the intention of his visit, with a witty kind of revenge, they refused to grant him his liberation, till he had written a panegyric on the Foe whom he had come to traduce. Stow speaks of one Robert Brune, (perhaps the same person) who wrote the following verses, on occasion of Edward I. issuing a new coinage. Edward did smelte round peny, halfe peny, farthing, The crosse passes the bond of all throughout the ring: The King's side was his head, and his name written, The crosse side what Citie it was in coyned or smitten. To poore man, ne to Priest, the peny fraises nothing, Men give God aye the least, they feast him with a farthing. A thousand two hundred, fourscore yeares add mo, On this money men wondred, when it first began to goe. It should be remarked, that âbefore the reign of Edward I. the penny was made (though not invariably) with a double cross, which admitted of being broken in half, so as to pass for two halfpence; or into four parts, so as to pass each for a farthing: Edward, on the contrary, coined, for the first time, his halfpence and farthings round. Near Winchester (Antiq. Soc. Minutes) about ten ounces weight of silver coin of Henry II. were found, many of them cut into halves and quarters, to assist their currency. At this period the Coins were all formed of silver. âI love the minstrel's strain, which gives to scenes, âAnd forms familiar, shade and character, âNew and august, educing, from plain things, âBy a peculiar alchymy, Alchymy about this time was in its zenith, from the writings of Albert the Great, Raymond Lully, and our own Friar Bacon. such powers, âAs whirl the passions in a giddy trance, âAnd petrify or wrap the obeisant soul. âOft have I heard of Cambria's Heaven-taught Bards; âIndulge my prayer. Sweep thou the willing string. âI mark'd yon vessel, toiling with the wave, âHer name and destinies alike unknown. âWith sad anticipation, I, her fate âCertain, beheld. Thou also saw'st the sight, âCalm from thy rocky stand. Make that thy theme. âThou wilt awake, in this my glowing breast, âSuch images, tho' natives of the heart, âDoom'd to captivity, and endless shade, âTill call'd to light and being, by the sound, âIn magic steep'd, of the soul-thrilling harp. âSing thou of the unsteady elements, âAnd frame thy song of the lost mariner.â Lhyrarch his harp upraised. His eye-balls roll'd, Oppress'd with inspirations. He exclaim'd, âThe sight still swims before my ardent gaze! âI stand upon the margin of the flood! âThe vision more than lives!â He struck the harp! Beneath this crag, that, huge and high, Forms a proud rampart to the tide; Serene, I mark the evening sky, And sky-encircled waters wide. The heavens, in all their pomp, recline, Now, on the bosom of the sea, And nature wears the form divine Of beauty, in its sanctity. While viewing thus the flood of fire, Unearthly dreams my soul inspire; I drink strange life, and, in amaze, Round, with delirious rapture, gaze, Till, rising, soaring, borne awayâ I spurn the manacle of clay. What crowds of every hue and dye, Now upon the waters lie!â Amid the glow of radiance round, A lordly line of light is found: There the young waves, with lightning glance, In their hour of pastime, dance O'er their sleeping parents' breast, Too light to break their peaceful rest. Again as I look it seems to be A column of fire, that rises high, From the fathomless depth of seaâ Faith-like, pointing to the sky. O path of loveliness! O fair high-way! Through which, methinks, celestial beings run, When they, in earnestness and bright array, Would overtake the fast-declining sun. Descending from the airy car, Now other objects fill my sight; I view the first faint trembling star, Leading on the train of night. To charm the eye, to sooth the ear, New sounds are heard, new forms appear. To this inhospitable shoreâ Whose dark-brow'd caverns ceaseless roar To the stately trees on high, Waving endless melody; Whilst the billows, at their feet, Still the answering note repeat. To this shore, the waves are bound (With foam or floating sea-weeds crown'd) Thro' the night, and thro' the day, In an undisturb'd array. Far as the aching eye can trace, On they come, with solemn pace, Wanderers wild from sea to sea, Strangers to tranquillity; For everlasting doom'd to roamâ To seek, but never find a home. Here with earnest course they throng, And bear their buoyant spoils along, Where, having cast them, with disdain, Again they plunge into the main, Till they rise, with vigour new, And their ancient course pursue. Upon the utmost verge of ocean, A homeward-destin'd bark appears; Tho' sailing fastâso slow its motionâ It emblems life's departing years! What transport in yon vessel dwells! Whilst gazing on his native shore, The Seaman's ardent bosom swells With happiness unknown before.â Exultant still he lifts his hand, Still bids the friendly gale arise; And bear him swifter to the land, That he has ever call'd the pride Of Earth, in her dominion wide, But which, by absence taught, he now doth idolize! Whilst the strain'd canvass courts the breeze, His bosom labours with delight, And pleasures dance before his sight, As the long line of purple coast he sees: Tho' sailing o'er the ocean green, With many a rolling surge between; Disdaining space, he sees! He hears! No shape of fancy it appears! He presses to his heart the maid, Who, bashful, to salute her lover flies! Or, rushes thro' the green-wood shade, Where his low cot of comfort lies! The faithful wife, with triumph proud, The hearty welcome pours aloud, Whilst his young children clasp his knee, And weep and smile, and smile and weep, That from the dangers of the deep, Their long-lost Sire they see. Orb of Glory! To the west, Thou speedest fast thy stately form; In robes of pearl and sapphire drest, Whilst, starting from their bed of rest, The imperious winds arouse the slumbering storm: Yet, as Night erects her throne, In one dark corner of the sky, And voices, with portentous moan, Sound on the gale that sweeps impetuous by; O'er the vex'd and boundless tide, Far-scatter'd sun-beams still delight to play, And the fair departing day In silent grandeur, sends its lustre wide. Earthly Pageants! veil your head! Here, behold, 'mid floods of light, Heaven his gorgeous vesture spread! Streaming fire and liquid gold. That, as they change, beneath the sight, New and nobler forms unfold. Thou Watery World! tho' lovely to our eyes, Whilst the rich clouds of eve illume thy breast; Say! art thou not a Monster in disguise, That know'st no mercy, and that feel'st no rest? Do not the smiles, upon thy brow presiding, Destruction's syren toils unceasing form? Is not that wrath, which now appears subsiding, Th' illusive prelude to some fiercer storm? With pang insatiate, evermore, Dost thou not thirst for human gore, And thy remorseless nature still reveal? Amid the winds that from thee fly, I hear the drowning seaman's cry, In plaintive sounds which lion hearts might feel! From age to age to thee are dear The Orphan and the Widow's tear! When didst thou stay thy boisterous wave, The ship-wreck'd mariner to save, Who, pendent from some jutting crag, espied, Beneath, the terrors of thy flood? When didst thou listen to the cry Of helpless, sinking Misery, That, stemming thy relentless tide, Sought the near shore, where Safety beckoning stood? Ah! what a change is here! Fill'd with terror and amaze, The scene grows darker, as I gaze, The Vengeance of the Deep is near! Whilst dark-blue clouds the Heavens o'ercast, The Sun hath left the western sky; And, sailing on the stormy blast, The venturous Sea-Birds, hurrying, homeward fly. The Waves that late all frolic play'd, Are now with ten-fold wrath array'd, Darting quick flashes from their thousand eyes, With anger, heighten'd by the Wind, Which fain their Giant Limbs would bind, When, to fierce strife, the Heavens and Ocean rise! Lo! sounding their defiance far, The Ancient Rivals rush to war! Each in fearful strength attired! Each with maddening fury fired!â Dreadful, in unavailing ire Th' indignant Winds awhile retire! Whilst the Proud Victor gazes round, For some new Foe, on whom to pour his rage! That Other Foe he now hath found! See! the Combatants engage! Ocean, collecting all his might, With Earth proclaims a baneful fight, And with inebriate reel, assaults the shore! Earth, that many a shock hath stood From wrathful Sky and stormy Flood, Smiles in her granite strength, and braves his deafening roar! No friendly Moon, no Stars appear! From dreams of death, roused by the stormy Tide, The Demons of the Tempest ride Triumphant, thro' the dark and troubled air, Or, hand in hand, A Ghastly Band, Whilst the Sinking Wretch they spy, With their songs of ecstasy Pace the ocean-beaten strand. To swell the horrors of the night, Lightnings flash their forked light, Quenching their fervour in the boisterous Main! Again! Again! And, what a sound, Bursts in lengthen'd peal around! Tho' fears that spring from Nature move my soul, Terrific pleasures on that voice await! Ye Unseen Powers, prolong the strain sublime, Allied to neither earth nor time, Which raise within me, as thro' Heaven they roll, The thought, in shadows dress'd, unutterably great! When the Elements conspire To sweep their deep-toned, awful Lyre, The rattling thunders, as they fly, Complete the dreadful harmony! Pity! whither art thou fled? Hast thou left this stormy scene For rivers smooth and meadows green, Where Peace reclines upon her roseate bed? From thy haunt, where'er it be, Darling Child of Sympathy! Haste! th' afflicted heart to cheer! Lo! a moving sight is here! In this shuddering hour of need, On thy swiftest pinion speed! The Bark, that long hath borne the beating wave, And now beholds her Haven near, Trembles o'er the yawning grave! Oh! Fly to succour! Fly to save! Amid the ravings of the Main, Thou art often call'd, tho' call'd in vain! Whilst âHelp!â faint heard, that doleful sound! Floats on the darken'd air, till with the tempest drown'd! The Storm increases! By the light Of Heaven's fierce splendors, I behold The Mariners, late brave and bold, Chain'd, steadfast, to the deck, in wild affright. Thro' Distraction's starting tear, They view their wives and children dear, Whom they had fondly hoped, erelong, to greet With all a Husband's, all a Father's joy, And feel domestic comforts sweet, The end of all their toil, without alloy; But now, (whilst those they love rejoice In the bless'd interview at hand, And every heart and every voice, Already hails them to their native land) They mark th' unruly sails disdain The weak controul of mortal rein; Dissever'd, on the winds they ride, Rent by Ocean in his pride! Whilst languid hope points to one glimmering star, Forebodings dread disclose their wretched state, They view the sails, plunged in the wave afar, And see their own inevitable fate! The Lightnings, as they flash, display The rocky shore, to which they onward drive! In vain with destiny they strive, Whilst Ocean, bellowing loud, demands his Prey. Now swifter borne before the hurrying blast, (Their last brave anchor, vainly cast!) They view dismay'd the white-waves glare at hand, Roaring o'er the rocky strand! To the near Cliffs their course they urge, In dark funereal terrors drest!â Erelong, and in the wrathful surge, Each palpitating heart shall rest!â Still nearer now the vessel draws! Fear suspends their labouring breath! A horrid pause! One moment more! The strife is o'er! Heard you that Shriek? It was the Shriek of Death! As Lhyrarch's final note slow died away, With faltering voice, and the slow-falling tear, Edward exclaim'd. âBrave man, I honor thee!â Edward has been accused of being accessory to the murder of the Bards, with as much justice as he has been charged with destroying all the Scottish Records, after having conquered Scotland: which opinion has been most satisfactorily refuted by Sir David Dalrymple. The Knight, who bore him thither, faintly cried, âPoor Mariners! O Bard, from this thy song, âI pity them thrice more, than when my eyes âEven saw the sightâperil and storm and death. âThat touch'd my eyes, but this hath moved my heart.â Edward replied, âBard! Reverenced be the power, âThat thus can raise such ferment in the veins, âAnd call out Pity from her deepest cell. âPoor wretched Beings! toss'd upon the wave, âTheir country doom'd to see, long sought in vain, âAnd whilst the blessed glimpse rose on their view, âCheering and fair, sent to Eternity! âI mourn their fate, as strangers, and to Heaven âSend fervent thanks, that none whom Edward loves, âIn that tremendous and soul-probing hour, âWhen they were toss'd on the âimperious surgeâ Those alone, in whom dwells the spirit of harmony, know how to appreciate the following well-known lines of Shakespear, (including the above phrase) which, with the most dignified conceptions, combine tones that are scarcely human. Wilt thou, upon the high and giddy mast, Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains In cradle of the rude, imperious surge, And in the visitation of the winds, Who take the ruffian billows by the top, Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them With deafening clamours in the slippery shrouds, That with the hurly, death itself awakes, Canst thou, O partial Sleep! Give thy repose To the wet Sea-boy in an hour so rude? And in the calmest and the stillest night, With all appliances, and means to boot, Deny it to a King? I would cursorily remark, that Shakspear is so justly the pride of Englishmen, that to intimate a defect though of the humblest kind, excites, in his admirers, a prompt feeling of opposition, like that which would be awakened by him, who presumed to point out a flaw in Magna Charta. Applause is so intimately associated with the name of our great Favourite of Nature that it almost represses and paralyzes the very power of judging and makes a man require as much stability in any adverse conclusion, as Garnerin felt before he severed the rope which precipitated him to the earth. If however, without presumption, one so defective as myself might venture to hazard a remark on the preceding passage, I would observe, that I have always thought (not from choice, but compulsion,) that there are two unfortunate lines in the above extract, and which if wholly omitted would improve the passage. I refer to the eighth and the twelfth lines. The first is an incongruous personification, which, instead of heightening, jars and interrupts the current of natural feeling. The second is not only objectionable from the low word âto bootâ us well as from the monotony occasioned by a similitude of cadence to the preceding line, but it unhappily enters into an extension of the thought, a minutia of description at the very moment of climax, when all might more advantageously have been left to the imagination. The mind, when hurried on by a connected chain of lofty thoughts, as it approaches its goal, becomes tremblingly alive to the least discordancy, whilst it is almost ferociously vigilant to repel the least foe which would diminish its anticipated joy. I do not say that these objections are just. I have compared them with no other mind, and venture the remarks, not to remove one grain from the firm base on which Shakspear rests, but to suggest a mere abstract question of taste, especially as my objection is of early origin, decided as to the first line, and accompanied with no doubt as to the second, but that, if it be not absolutely defective, it is such as the Poet might easily have elevated into a more corresponding excellence with its brethren. But while I remark that the lines in question appear (at least to myself) to be two blue veins in a slab of Parian marble, I would in justice further observe, that no example, of equal vigour and smoothness with the above extract, is to be met with in the blank verse of Shakspear's contemporaries. The minds and language of other men appear to mount always with a clog, whilst our Immortal Bard, whether skimming the earth, or ascending on the eagle's wing, displays a prodigality of grace, and commands as his birth-right all the voluptuous undulations of harmony. Progression was not for him. He saw and seized the pinnacle. Soaring in self-created freedom he looked down on his vassal age, whilst in his exuberant opulence and felicity, he seems to have anticipated the utmost limits of perfection, of which, under any degree of cultivation, our language is susceptible.âThe same mind, the same characteristic modus of thought, is carried by a writer into all his productions, whether metrical or not: what prose Shakspear would have written! âFelt, ere they died, their spirits melt within. âKnow! thou art free! Pass on where'er thou wist âYet I would urge thee, in no musing hour, âWhen thou art roving wild amid the stars, âAnd this low ball of matter, where we dwell, ââDull mortals,â disappears, and its concerns âDwindle to empty air; in such an hour, âIf thou thy soaring aspects can restrain, âHeart-honor'd son of song, O venture not, âThus on the verge of death, heedless, to tread. âHad Talbot met thee, or fierce Venables, âThou hadst not lived to sing of seas and storms.â Lhyrarch, to earth bent lowly and retired. BOOK XXII. SCENE, Conway Castle. O what a shout distracting rent the air When Edward fell! The self same attitude, Llewellyn held, with which he gave the blow, Unconscious, on the wall, till the loud trump Sounded retreat, amid the general roar. The Foe fast hastening to their Camp at hand, Llewellyn cried, âPrepare! Instant pursuit! âUpon the plain, buckler and sword shall sound! âThe victory is ours! The day is won!â He spake, when at that moment, with dismay, The fleet is seen, burden'd with fighting men, And speeding on toward Conway's eastern shore! (Talbot and Venables from Mona borne.) Llewellyn pauses. In his labouring mind, Plans opposite doubtful contention hold. The path is fix'd. His Chiefs Llewellyn calls. Thus he began. âTho' Conway's towers are firm, âAnd, with such force, as now protects her walls, âMay laugh at danger, yet our Foe is strong; âNor must we risk our all upon a Tower âThrice firmer than this Conway. Mark your Prince. âI had design'd, instant, the hot pursuit, âAnd the fierce conflict on the shore beneath, âBut, yonder fleet behold! throng'd with bold men, âSwelling King Edward's ranks. Our path is clear. âWe must escape to yon cloud-cover'd spot, âOld Dolbadarn, rising on Snowdon's brow; âWhere victory hath often follow'd us, âAnd safety ever. There our scatter'd force âWill round us throng, and if our mortal Foe âShould venture, where his fathers found defeat, â(Among our rocks and mountain fortresses) âOur swords shall win an easy road to fame.â The night is come. Aloud the wind is heard; The storm descends. Llewellyn and his host Pass thro' the gateway, and their course pursue, Like the straight arrow thro' the yielding air, Toward Dolbadarn, that Castle of the Clouds. With a precipitance, bordering on flight, Llewellyn, thro' the darkness, urged his course Toward Snowdon's brow, and when the day arrived, Still, with his troops, he sped, intent to gain The summit of the mountain, where he, erst, In hours of peril, he and his brave Sires, Refuge oft found. And now the base he reach'd, Of that proud hill, wild, waste and desolate, Stripp'd of its charms. It was a cheerless hour; The eminence was veil'd in mists and clouds. The rain descended, and the beating wind Wound shrill around the mountain, whilst on high, 'Mid fitful gusts, a hollow roar was heard. There the fierce winds revell'd in wanton play, Or in deep tones of anger, surlily, Told of their wrath,âamid the scatter'd thorn, (Bent from the blast) the crag and cavern rude, Waking strange noises. The repelling frown Snowdon now wore, seem'd like an alter'd friend, Grown great, or famous. Not, as heretofore, The Cambrians, with selecting step, pass'd on, Choosing their road, or rough or smooth ascent, And turning oft, to drink refreshment in, Where the rich prospect burst, voluptuous, Upon the sight; in a straight line they go,â O'er spots till then deem'd inaccessible, Forgetful of each thought of idle thing, Nor looking to the right, nor to the left; And now with strenuous and unceasing toil, (Not to be borne save by the mountaineer Accustomed to the stone-path and the rock,) They plunge into the clouds, and reach at length, Th' aerial summit, where above the mists, Firm Dolbadarn rais'd his proud head in scorn. When Edward landed by the Conway side, As the first fight was o'er, his mind conceived, That Cambria's last resort, again might prove On Snowdon, where his fathers refuge found. Aloud he cried, âArgent, the three stags heads!â In chivalrous times, when the King wanted a particular Chieftain, instead of vociferating his name, he merely called on his arms, which was well understood by the attendant Squire, and who immediately brought the person required. This custom originated in necessity, for the general armour of Knights being similar, there was scarcely any way of distinguishing a particular commander, except by his arms, which were painted on his shield and embroidered behind, on his surcoat or mantle, as well as on the caparison of his horse. Every individual was known by his arms, with as much promptitude and accuracy as the various flags of a fleet are by modern seamen. Stanley drew near. Cried Edward, âWhilst we strive âWith Cambria, on the plain, and Conway's towers âLevel with earth, thou to the mountain speed. âThere is a Castle on the loftiest brow; âMake Dolbadarn thy own. We little know âWhat value its possession hence may bear. âA thousand veterans bold, follow thy will.â Young Stanley, knight of honorable fame, The pride of chivalry, toward Snowdon heights, Presses, and courts the desperate enterprize, Zealous to consummate his Monarch's will. Scarce had Llewellyn reach'd old Snowdon's brow, When, posting up the steep rough eminence, (Long-wilder'd with the mountain path) appear'd Stanley, the gallant knight. Onward he comes, Emerging from the clouds, which, round the base, And far ascending up the craggy side, Stretch'd their broad belt. Llewellyn cried aloud âBehold the Enemy! Speed to the war!â Instant from Dolbadarn, the Cambrian force Pours on impetuous. Stanley saw the Foe, Unknowing whence and countless as Heaven's stars, Such they appear'd to his astonished gaze. âRetreat! Retreat!â sounds thro' the English host. And now adown the mountain, hurrying on, Head foremost, like the rolling Avalanche, Immense masses of snow often fall from the summits of the Norway mountains, by which sometimes whole villages are borne down and destroyed. By one of these snow-falls a village, situated between Quinherret and Hardanger, was wholly covered and so remains to this day. The snow which had thus fallen from the adjacent mountains, not dissolving the year after, was augmented the following year, and progressively hardened and increased, till it became a mountain of snow. Many lives werelost by this disaster, and as a rivulet runs under the snow it often brings out knives, scissars and other implements belonging once to the unfortunate inhabitants. Such accidents are common amongst the Alps. Stanley escapes. Behind him, following fast, Llewellyn's sword appears, and the pursuit Is hot and earnest. Hast'ning toward the spot, E'en at this moment, so by chance decreed, Lo! David now appearsâbearing his spoil, And noble prisoners. He beheld the host, Rushing like torrents from the storm-drench'd hill. âThe Foe! The Foe!â He cried. Instant they speed To stay the fugitives. Encompass'd thus, Stanley submits, while England's gallant host All captives stand, save on the extreme verge, Fleet-rushing, or obscured among the thorns, A vent'rous few, who thus escaped, to bear The tidings to their Monarch. Never yet, Old Snowdon heard such pealing shouts ascend From her broad breasts and craggy pinnacles, As at this hour, when every heart had burst, Had not its flood of joy a passage found, And shouts and uproar reign'd. David now hastes, With his throng'd captives, to Llewellyn near. The princely brothers welcome with loud greet. David thus cried. âSuccess hath crown'd our arms! âI bear thee tidings, such as shall inspire âBoth thee and thine with firmer confidence. âDenbigh has stoop'd to me! And to these men, âSons of Renown. Rhuthynon too hath fallen, âAnd here are Captives, Warriors known to fameâ âEarl Pembroke and Earl Mortimer, o'ercome âIn arduous fight, by Cambria's veteran bands.â Llewellyn cried. âNow hast thou well sustain'd âThy ancient character, and blotted out, âE'en to the faintest stain, all that impeach'd, âOnce, thy fair loyalty. These are proud days. âOn every hand success upholds our state, âAnd we may hope, erelong, Edward to trap âAmong these pathless mountains; with disgrace âO'erwhelm our deadliest Foe, sending him back âAbash'd, to tell how Cambria waged the fight.â Edwall, the scene beholding, with surprise, Amid the trembling Captives, Stanley saw, Mute, gazing at the earth! Instant, the news He bears to David; David sought the Prince, Then Stanley found, and cried. âThou didst my Friend âRelease in hour of peril, David now âReleases thee. Free as the mountain wind, âPass on thy way.â Stanley to Heaven look'd up. Clasping his hand, he cried. âOne prayer is mine, âThat I may live to shew, most gallant Prince! âThe burden of the spirit's gratitude.â He spake, and down the rough wild mountain sped. Llewellyn and Prince David instant turn'd To seek bleak Dolbadarn, joy in each face, Ascending sturdily the crags; and now, Once more, they reach the castle of the clouds. Upon the brow of the south-stretching hills, A man advances, on the fleetest steed! All pause expectant of the news he bears. He hastens to the Prince. Thus he began. âEarl Warwick long hath ravaged Dinevawr, âWhen late to Powis-Land he bent his way, âBearing all force before him. Thou didst send âRhywaldon to oppose this wasting Earl. âThey fought; Rhywaldon suffer'd the defeat. âHe flies before the Earl, he and his host. âI am the first to bear the doleful news.â Llewellyn cried. âDavid our counsellor, âAnd Anarawd and Edwall, and ye host âOf veteran chiefs, this path doth wisdom prompt. âIt is expedient, instant, to depart âAnd meet this daring Earl, ere he his force âConjoin with Edward. David, thou, thy staff âUpon this spot shalt plant. To fainter spirit âNot to be trusted; I, meantime, will haste âToward Warwick, on the southern side these hills. âHe, vanquish'd, we again will meet, and hurl âDeath on our greater Foe!â David replied, âProsperity be thine! Till next we meet, âI will profoundly think how best to serve âThe cause I once rejected, and, for wrongs âBitterly mourn'd, to my poor Native Land, âAnd thee, my Brother, multiply proud deeds âOf valourous might. Success attend thy course, âNor doubt the courage of thy Brother here.â When Warwick's Earl, from Gloster, hasten'd on, (Bearing De Montford's daughter) with designs To enter Cambria's land at Dinevawr, Fair Eleanor, most lovely in her tears, Pleaded with Warwick, in so sweet a tone Of mild solicitude, with such soft words, For liberty to pass toward him she loved, That Warwick promised her her amplest wish. âI haste,â he cried, âcommissioned by my King, âTo conquer southern Cambria, and extend âMy march toward Powis, Gwyned then to seek, âAnd join my arms with Edward in the war. âChaste as morn's star thou shalt my course attend, âAnd in some favouring hour, as well becomes âThe Son of Chivalry, thee will I bear âTo him thou prizest. Tho' in war our Foe, âIn love, he is our Friend, and pity mourns, âThat hearts like yours discord should separate. âThee I admire, as the transcendent height âOf woman's excellence. Warwick, too, owns âOne, braver than Llewellyn, never poised âThe hero's spear, or wore the diadem. âYet, war decrees it. He is still my Foe, âAnd I must fight the man whom I could love. âYet shall one generous deed, Maiden, be mine. âI will release thee from captivity. âAltho' it tear my spirit from my frame, âLike true-born knight, this deed will I perform.â Fair Eleanor, her eyes with tears suffused, Cried, faultering. âNoble Earl! thou dost confer âSplendor on knighthood. Vainly would I tell âThe gratitude that rises in my breast. âThe weakness of expression, till this hour, âFor the full heart, to serve as vehicle, âNever I knew. A nobler soul than thine, âPossess'd of more imperial eminence âOf lofty qualities, lives not, save one; âAnd I can only thank thee with my tears.â Earl Warwick traversed Dinevawr and made Conquests renown'd. The Chieftains of the Land, Most famed in war, had round Llewellyn throng'd, And left their castles, not with veterans bold, As erst, when England's bands from th' Cambrian hills, Oftimes were driven, o'erwhelm'd with death and shame; But now their untried arms, successive yield To Warwick's valour, and he march'd along Heaping success. Brecknock his towers resign'd, Radnor, and Hay, and Built, and Abatild, Frodsham, and Mould; and now his way he bent Toward Conway, when Rhywaldon stemm'd his course. They fought. The Cambrian well his name upheld, But, grappling with superior power, he fled! Warwick pursued; when, as the eve advanced, Weary with following the fleet-bounding foe, The Earl a castle reach'd, Lhanurst, whose walls Once were robust, now mouldering to decay. At his approach the few who dwelt there fled. He enter'd, with fair Eleanor, and now, With all the faithfulness and courtesy Of English Knight, revolved how best to bear The maiden to her lover. Whilst his thoughts Pored earnest thus, a ghastly fugitive Announces that Llewellyn is at hand. Lo! He approaches with a gallant force, And Warwick is surrounded! In his mind, Confused and jarring thoughts rush'd to and fro. A fancied thing till then, Danger appear'd, But now, his firm resolve, scarcely restrains The trembling knee. A momentary fear! Warwick exclaims aloud. âFlee to your posts! âIf to the charge our enemies advance, âOur hearts are English, and our swords are steel, âAnd, noble is our cause. What want we more?ââ Warwick, and each around, now fortify Their hearts for the assault, resolved like men To conquer, or, their lives dearly to sell. The night arrives. Llewellyn and his host Now gather round the walls and for the morn Wait only to begin the fierce assault. One to Earl Warwick comes. Slowly he spake, âOur Foes are many and thy force is small. âWe may not bear the brunt of Cambria's spear. âTo flee is no disgrace. To save our lives, âThus hemm'd, and certain of a speedy fall, âIs most exempt from sordid cowardice.â âWhat mean'st thou?â Warwick cried. The man replied, âThere is a secret passage leading hence, âWhich opens to a cave below yon hill, âWhence thou may'st flee, before the morning light, âHalf-way, toward Conway.â Warwick cried aloud. âThat be our path! Dishonour there is none, âIn flight to seek our safety, free of harm, âWith such a force, from such an enemy.â The summons is sent forth. Throughout the place, The tidings run, and for the darkest hour Of pitchy midnight, anxious now they wait. If ever stormy feelings in a breast Woke uproar rude, O Eleanor! thy heart Knew well its force. The terrors of assault, Where blood and death became familiar sights! And the approach of him, e'en at the gate, Llewellyn, in whose happiness her own Was center'd, and whose vows of tenderness She had received and plighted oft again. It was a juncture of o'erwhelming power. She for Llewellyn fear'd, whose side some dart Might pierce, or, on whose head the sword might light. She trembled for herself, and, in her heart, Felt some solicitude for Warwick's Earl, Pride of nobility, the bold, the brave. Where Eleanor, in anguish, with her maid, Sat on the future pondering, suddenly Earl Warwick entered. On his brow he wore Anxiety and the unsettled thought. He cried, âO Eleanor! now must we part! âA last adieu is ours! Never again, âMay Warwick listen to thy tale of woe, âAnd envy him, whose heart thou hast enthrall'd. âFarewell!â âWhat!â Eleanor exclaim'd, âO say!â Warwick replied. âThere is a secret door, âLeading far off, thro' which, at night, we pass;â âLeaving this castle, when the morn awakes, âTo Cambria's noble Prince. O Eleanor! âThee, too, will I resign. Here shalt thou stay. âThy wanderings now shall cease. A prize shall wait âLlewellyn, which his spirit dared not hope.â With transport! Eleanor exclaim'd, âMy soul, âO Chief! exults, that thou wilt 'scape the fight; âNor two such sons of valour, as thyself âAnd brave Llewellyn, measure sword with sword. âGo! and may Heaven uphold thy generous heart, âAnd in the day of battle screen thy head! âMay all it's choicest blessings, it's best gifts âRest on thee, and thy future days be peace! âHow shall my full heart bear its evidence âFor all the favours shewn to Eleanor?â âPoor, friendless, wretched, but for thy support; âO generous Earl! If ere the time should come, âWhen gratitude may banquet sumptuously, âWhen I may do thee favour, and return âPart of that debt, immeasurably great, âWhich to Earl Warwick's gallantry I oweâ âThe flower of chivalry and knighthood's pride, âThen will my heart be satisfied. Brave Earl, âNow must thou only take a Maiden's thanks.â Earl Warwick seized her hand. No word he spake. He bore it to his lips, then waved adieu, And, with the lingering look, slowly retired. A Chieftain hastens near. Earnest he cried, âAll wait our Leader.â Warwick now descends Down to the Castle's centre, under ground, A dreary path, where, in due order ranged, His troops awaited him, marshall'd and still, The air was damp. The flaming torch, in vain, Cast its dim rays against the mouldering walls; Still, all was dark! And now the iron doors Harshly unfold and grating, thro' the place Sending terrific sounds. Warwick proceeds. A torch before him blazed, yet all around Was rayless midnight, where each form of hate Dwelt undisturb'd, reptile and creeping thing. Adown the steps they pass'd, if steps they were, In ages past, hewn from the craggy rock, And now obscured and fretted with the rains, That, creeping thro' the fissures, to this place Trickled, or from the shallow and dark roof, Unceasing dripp'd, noiseless, and made the place Cold, damp, and vapo'ry. Still they pass along, Silent as sleep, save that the sliding foot, And hollow tread, woke their peculiar sounds Discordant, and oppress'd the serious heart. Still on they pass, nor knowing where the path, Winding might lead, to safety, or to death. In darkest doubt, a cavern's mouth they reach! The stars appear!âtill then a common sight, But now, the fairest of creation fair. âOnward!â Earl Warwick cried. âSpeed, ardent, on! âSafety before us waits, fetters behind!â And now unpausing, thro' the midnight hours, They urge their course toward Conway's battlements. What thoughts were thine, O Eleanor, alone, (Save thy one faithful maid) 'mid aged towers, Spacious, all ivy-grown, where dwelt secure Bats and the sullen owl, throughout the night, Sounding their shrill âTo-whooâ. No welcome sleep Gently descended with its soothing aid. Fair Eleanor, and her one damsel, press'd, Near to each other, trembling, thro' the night, And told their fears in whispers, which the walls, Babbling, spread wide. The winds, throughout the night, Among the lofty turrets, roar'd aloud, Or, 'mid the ivy moan'd; whilst oftentimes Some distant door screak'd on its heavy hinge, Or closed impetuous, sending thro' the place Deafening and lengthen'd peals, that died away, Only, for other sounds, lofty or faint, Fast foll'wing. Each mysterious voice they heard Made both the nearer creep, and trembling gaze One moment toward the spot, whence the sound came. Faint beam'd the torch, and now distinct they heard Footstep approaching! Each her breath restrain'd! It nearer came. Lo! At the door it paus'd!â A lonely dog it was, who thro' the space Himself half thrust, and seeing human form, And loathing solitude, forward advanced, His head low crouching and his moving tail Speaking dumb joy. The quick extended hand, Patting his neck and smoothing his rough side Welcom'd the courteous stranger, whilst delight Dwelt in the damsels' eyes. Each, silently, Told her surprise, mingled with happiness. For this her guardian, instant, each herself Felt stout at heart. Fear seem'd an idle thing. Tho' oft, in Eleanor's still anxious mind, Reflection came, that armies were without, And swords on slaughter bent; but quick the thought Rose in her mind, with lulling influence, That it was Cambria's Prince, the Lord she loved! The brave Llewellyn. Tho' till then her heart, As the first earthly object, had desired His presence, now, that at the gate he stood, And there was certainty, when the night pass'd, Of seeing him, her spirit sank within. She half regretted what she most desired: And then, the way, the moment; such an hour, So unexpected! Powerful sympathies Turn'd toward Llewellyn, and her anxious heart Conceived of his surprise; thus on her mind, Thro' the long night crowding tumultuous thoughts. The faint dawn glimmers in the orient sky, Sent thro' the grated window. Eleanor Cried, âRise, O Maid! Thou to Llewellyn haste, âYonder, in arms! Heed not the marshall'd front. âGo boldly, and this spotless scarf extend, âEmblem of Peace!â The Maiden silent rose, And to the door pass'd on. The Dog upsprang: Half way he follow'd her, then slowly turn'd, Gazing on her he left. Doubtful he stood, One moment, then to Eleanor return'd, And by her side gently lay down to rest. Soon as the morn appear'd, to those around Llewellyn cried, intent upon his prize, âFor storm prepare! Erelong and we will make, âThis Castle ours, with Warwick's lofty Earl.â All things are ready for the fierce assault. Scarce had the dawn illumed the eastern sky, When, 'cross the turf, a lonely damsel speeds, Her white scarf waving. To the Cambrian force Her way she bends, firm, tho' before her stand Engines of death and terrors numberless. So strange a sight fetters the warrior's eye. She passes on and boldly now inquires, âWhere is Llewellyn?â To the Prince she speeds. âAnd what of me?â he cried. The Maiden spake. âThou seekest WarwickâWarwick long hath fled! âThere is a secret path, thro' which he pass'd, âDark, subterraneous, a most dreary way, âLeading beneath yon hill, and by this hour, âFast-speeding thro' the night, doubtless hath reach'd âConway, where now King Edward's forces wait.â Llewellyn wildly gazed. The damsel cried, âI have yet other tidings for thine ear. âIn yonder Castle, one, who is thy friend, âWaits to receive thee. More I may not say. âDoubt not my words, but speed and prove them true.â âA Friend!â Llewellyn cried. âWhy came he not, âE'en now, with thee? No man shall call me friend, âWho in this day of peril hath not braced âHis sword for combat. Damsel, thou hast err'd! âMy Friend he cannot be! Warriors! Pursuit! âUpon the crafty Warwick, follow hard! âCoward! Our swords may yet retard his flight!â With earnest speech, the Damsel cried again, âDoubt not my words, brave Prince! One sojourns there, âA friend that thou dost love, faithful and true, âWhom shouldst thou shun, sorrow will be thy lot, âAnd anguish and remorse, bitter as death.â âProceed!â Llewellyn cried, âA moment's pause, âZeal may recover.â Now the Damsel hastes, Joyful; Llewellyn and his host behind. They reach the castle, thro' the gate they pass. The Maid precedes. Now, hurrying to the spot, Where Eleanor abode (Llewellyn near, Doubting the mystery) aloud she cried. âBrave Prince, behold thy Friend!â Llewellyn starts! â'Tis she!â He cried. Eager he rushes on! And now his Eleanor clasps in his arms! No word the Maiden spake, and he, whose heart Had dared war's fiercest blast, trembling now stands, Silent and mild as infancy. He spake. âMy love! My Eleanor! My chief delight! âThis is an hour supreme of ecstasy. âThou still art dearer than the light of Heaven.â Bathed in her tears of transport, she replied, Only, by pressing to her trembling heart, Closer, the man she prized. Llewellyn spake, âSay! Best belov'd, if calmness thou possess âFor utt'rance, when thy heart so overflows, âSay! Whence in moment and in place like this, âJewel, so rare, appears!â Thus Eleanor, Faultering, replied. âKnow thou, for whom my heart âIlls countless has sustain'd, and now, at length, âIn unexpected hour, so well repaid, âThus stand I here.âThe pride of chivalry âIs Warwick's Earl! A noble ancestry âHe boasts, and on the name hath sworn, to heap âAccumulated honors, and renown, âLasting as earth. He bore me from a man, â'Mid Gloster's towers, his blackest antitype, âTalbot, inglorious name! Warwick I told âOf our oft-plighted faith, even of the vows âSolemn, I had exchanged with Cambria's Prince, âThan fate, more firm. He, noble Earl, replied, âTo rescue Damsels from all threaten'd harm, âAnd thraldom, is the knighthood oath I swore. âAnd tho' ten thousand hills of steel arise âTo stem my purpose, as befitteth knight, âGuardian of woman's charms, I will disdain âEach huge impediment, and break the spear, âUnceasing, in the injured maiden's cause!â Llewellyn cried. âMost brave! When such men breathe âIt is an honor to be born a man. âSpeak on, thou spirit mild!â Thus she pursued. âEarl Warwick cried, âbehold in me thy friend!â âAn English Earl, a Knight of ancient fame, âWhose sword shall guard thee and whose spear defend, âTho' Demons rose to thwart his purposes. âI have a high design. Renounce thy fears! âEdward, our King, sends me, with veterans true âTo conquer Dinevawr, then to direct âMy course toward Gwyned, scattering round dismay. âThis must I do. Allegiance to my Prince, âAnd honor's voice, prompt my fidelity, âYet, where the generous deed, warfare allows, âI am not backward. Damsel, mark my words! âThou, with some maiden faithful, e'en with me, âShalt enter Cambria, and my faith I plight, âAt some convenient hour, spotless of harm, âTo send thee to Llewellyn, a brave man, âAltho' a foe.â With Warwick's Earl, I pass'd âThro' Dinevawr, thro' Powis, and at length, âThis Castle we attain'd. Thou in that hour âEncircled'st us, and Warwick, and his men, âPrepared for valiant fight. One told the Earl âOf a dark passage, underneath the hill; âA covert path, for secret purposes, âWhence they might flee. At dead of night they pass'd âThro' that same way. Ere then, Earl Warwick cried, ââNow must I leave thee. Maiden thou shalt meet âHim whom thou lov'st, whilst I, myself prepare, âInstant, for flight. Damsel, a last adieu! âWhere'er thou go'st, whatever be thy home, âAngles, with most especial vigilance, âProtect thee, and their choicest gifts impart.â âHe said and thro' the passage urged his way.â Llewellyn spake, âMy Eleanor! My Pride! âNow are we happy!â Sudden thro' his breast, Corroding, an unutterable pang Shot deadly. Of the lengthen'd war he thought, And something of a dark uncertainty Hung o'er his mind. Perplex'd, awhile he stood, Mute, whilst fair Eleanor her speech pursued. âI mourn, my Lord! that, at an hour, when joy âShould light our eyes, and, on the past, our tongue âDwell only to augment our sum of bliss; âThat at this hour, War, with his blasting trump, âOn every side should sound, and thy brave mind âBe harass'd, whilst thy hands those weapons bear.â Llewellyn sigh'd. When the quick smile he shew'd, Offspring of firmness, and thus answer made. âGrieve not, my Eleanor! The cloud, tho' dark, âValour will soon disperse, and present cares âServe only to augment our future joy.â âKnow, Maid beloved! Prosperity is ours! âCastles, by England won, the Cambrian arm âHath rescued, whilst high prisoners grace our trainâ âPembroke and MortimerâEarls far renown'd! âE'en Edward, our fierce foe, with this good axe, âI beat from Conway's loftiest battlements! âHeadlong he fell to earth!â âBut is he dead?â Eager, cried Eleanor. âNo!â Spake the Prince. âThe Saxon lives till we do meet again. âOn Snowdon's giddy brow, we have a tower, âSacred to fame, and dear to liberty, âWhence our forefathers drove our enemies, âWhoever trod that mountain eminence, âBack, deluged with disgrace. There at this hour, âCambria's brave veterans wait, courting the fight, âShould Edward dare that lofty pinnacle. âA contest hastens on with our great Foe, âA deadly strife. Nay, Eleanor, forbear âThat look of sudden horror! We must meet! âIt is decreed that on the Cambrian hills, âFierce as ten thousand storms, Edward must fight âLlewellyn, guardian of his father's fame: âAnd if this venturous King live to return, âIt is that palsying cowardice hath seized âThis arm of mine, and terror drench'd this heart. âThou little know'st, with what consuming zeal âOur gallant subjects long to meet the foe, âAnd measure swords and poise the vengeful spear: âThou little know'st what thousands, at this hour âPant for the combat, and thou little know'st âThe strength of Snowdon. Let no creeping fear âHang round thy heart. Days of rejoicing wait, âAnd high festivities. Brace up thy mind. âAnd look beyond the storm, where the sun shines. âIf aught that wears the semblance of concern âPresses within, it is, O Eleanor, âThat thou art in the midst of Camps and Wars; âThy tender frame may tremble, and the scene, âWhere danger is not, harrow up thy fears. âFor thee I mourn.â âNay,â Eleanor replied, âI have a heart can stoop to circumstance. âMourn not for me. Altho' I Gallia left, âHoping, 'mid peace, to visit Cambria's land, âAnd meet Llewellyn, yet the tide of things âRunning most crossâfor thee alone I speakâ âIf seem thee meet, I, to the shore I left, âWill hasten, yet again, and wait the hours, âTill thou hast conquer'd peace and fresh renown.â Llewellyn cried. âBest treasure here below! âLet thee depart! Again re-cross the seas, âAnd buffet with the waves, haply more fierce, âFor an uncertain future, clad in grey! âRenounce the fairest jewel in my crown! âNot for all diadems Earth calls her own! âThe war erelong will cease; glory afresh âIrradiate Cambria, whilst our foes retire âDiscomfited, before out furious lance. âSome stout and trusty hearts, straight will I send âToward Aber, our abode, the palace fair âWhich longs to hail its mistress. Bitter hours âAre they which roll between our happiness! âO War! Thy haggard front, never, till now, âSaw I so hateful. Tho' thou barr'st awhile âOur hoped felicity, the hours are near, âOur nuptial hours, when on no dubious throne, âThou sittest, whilst all Cambria stoops and smiles. âBut now, far other scenes hang on our rear; âMark me, O Eleanor, my heart's best joy! âThou now must speed with me toward Dolbadarn. âThere is our stand, and there thy home must be, âTill we have hurried from our mountain heights âThese ravenous wolves, and won immortal fame.â Thus Eleanor replied. âThese are strange scenes, âAccording ill with peace and solitude, âSuch as I knew beneath a mother's wing, âEre I to meet Llewellyn cross'd the seas: âYet mourn I not. In all that thou canst bear, âWould not my heart participate, in joy âAlike, or sorrow? Let me share a part, âIn all thy triumphs, and if Heaven see fit âTo give thee darker days, thine Eleanor, âShall sooth thy spirit, and her constancy âBe thy support, when fortune leaves thee sad.â Llewellyn clasp'd her hand. âBest gift of Heaven!â Earnest he cried, âour loves, the Bard shall sing, âYet to be born. Faithful this heart shall prove, âThrough future days, aspiring to deserve, âBy all that tender is, such love as thine. âNow, 'till the wars are o'er, thy brief abode âBe Dolbadarn, the Castle of the Clouds.â The Maiden smiled assent, when with light heart, Llewellyn and the Damsel and the Host Of hardy Warriors, sought old Snowdon's brow. BOOK XXIII. SCENE, The Castle of Dolbadarn. Fair Eleanor, and Cambria's noble Prince Reach Dolbadarn, where, panting for the war, David they find. Astonish'd at her tale, David, with joy his promised sister hails, And welcomes her, and tells her of the war, So soon to cease; recounts the past exploits Of Cambrians, fighting for their hills and vales, Their homes and liberty. âHere,â he exclaim'd, âThro' ages past, Cambria, in all her might, âHath planted on the rock her sturdy spear. âThis spot, impregnable, laughs at all harm. âTo Dolbadarn after thy hardships past, âWelcome, my sister, and my future friend. âKnowing that on this giddy eminence, âIn th' rudest hour, security reclines, âI, to this spot, have summon'd her I love, âAnd her sweet infants, fair as evening stars. âHourly I look, within these castle heights, âTo view my treasure. Thou wilt feel thy heart âJoin'd with my Gladis, for a sweeter mind, âA breast more fill'd with all ennobling thoughts, âNe'er met in woman.â As with tender voice, Thus he declared, Llewellyn hastens near! Distraction in his eye, aloud he cries, âThe Foe advances! David, to thy post! âMy Eleanor! Let not thy spirit sink, âTho' warfare round should rage. 'Tis a brief storm; âThe morrow will be peace. O stay thy fears! âErelong and we shall smile, both thou and I. âFarewell! Awhile I haste where duty calls.â âGo!â Eleanor replied. âSaints be thy guard! âI will, of Heaven, petition for my Lord!â They part and now Llewellyn seeks his Chiefs. The night Llewellyn fled from Conway's towers, He cried, âBrave Tudor, tho' this place I leave, âIt must not be resign'd. To thy good arm âI will confide it. Should the Foe assail, âThou wilt acquit thyself, as well becomes âA noble Cambrian.â âBy the sword I wield,â Tudor exclaim'd, âI will. Now speed thou on, âAnd may high Heaven prosper our valiant Prince.â Llewellyn Snowdon sought, whilst Tudor's heart Prepared itself for the approaching morn. That morning came. Edward, for storm advanced. To Lincoln, near, he cried. âThe walls are thinn'd! âI trust our crafty foe hath foil'd us not âBy the nocturnal flight. Chieftain, speed hence! âSeize on what straggling Hind In the first edition, I had made Lincoln instantly return with a Hind. But it has since appeared to me that, where it is practicable, the most indifferent character should not be admitted without an accompanying circumstance, calculated to excite some portion of interest in the mind of the readerâsomething which should distinguish the tree fixed on, from the other trees of the forest. With this impression, I have introduced the Cambrian Hind, in a sort of humble Eclogue. It would be paying myself too high a compliment to suppose that the reader could feel any uneasiness from this brief interruption to the story. may cross thy way, âAnd from him wrench the truth.â Lincoln departs. That morn, in a near valley, deep embower'd By roaring trees, thro' which a busy stream Hasten'd along, while fast the rain came down, An aged Shepherd, from his cottage door, Beheld a Youth (the tall crook in his hand) Pacing with earnest step. He hasten'd forth, And heard him chant, thus, as he moved along. Young Shepherd. Wind and Rain, your fury hot Makes the tall Larch round me bow; Wind and Rain, I heed you not, I am hastening homeward now. Old Shepherd. Stranger, from the driving storm, To my friendly Cot repair; With a British welcome warm, Rest and food await thee there. Young Shepherd. I have travelled wide and long Thro' gloomy skies and lonely ways; And a sickness deep and strong Now upon my spirit preys. Old Shepherd. Poor Youth! In pity, thee to cure I'll call the Doctress, old and grey; Her forest simples, choice and pure, Soon shall chase thy pains away. Young Shepherd. Nothing here can ease my ailing, Forest simples will not heal; Know the cause of my complainingâ 'Tis Home-Sickness which I feel. Old Shepherd. Home! What home is half so sweet As my cot, and field and fold? Hear the lambkins, how they bleat! This clear bubbling brook behold! Young Shepherd. My Father's home, my Father's tillage, His fields, his flocks, his herds I see; And the brook of my own village Is the sweetest brook to me. Old Shepherd. View yon hill, so bleak and bare, Oft it mounts above the sky; Whilst, around, the clouds of air Float in silver majesty. Young Shepherd. We have clouds and mountains too, Lovely clouds and mountains steep, And from our door the evening view Oft makes me on my pillow weep. Old Shepherd. This cottage, deck'd with flowers so gay, My home from youth to age hath been; Nor would I leave, for princely sway, The loveliest spot that sun hath seen. Young Shepherd. Around my Cot, with breath serener, The winds, their bowers of perfume leave; The very leaves and lawns are greener, And richer is the blush of eve. Old Shepherd. Ardent Shepherd, thee believing, Thy home must breathe celestial spice; To call it Earth is but deceiving, 'Tis a rosy Paradise. Young Shepherd. Oh! 'tis Earth, the more I love it! Thy brook is sweet, thy cot is fair, But my home is far above it, Peace is here, but transport there. Old Shepherd. Tell me! Art thou near thy door, Where first thou heard'st the torrent's sound, And with intemperate joy didst pore On forms, thy heart with cords that bound? Young Shepherd. A few more hills, my steps impelling, A few more vales, O rapturous dream! And I shall rush into my dwelling, Mine own dear Cot, beside the stream! Old Shepherd. Thy transports rise above all measure, The sun must there perpetual shine; What else can give such boundless pleasure To this wond'rous home of thine? Young Shepherd. Sweet it is beyond expression, There I laugh'd in infancy; There I lived to man's discretion, And my home is dear to me. Old Shepherd. Hast thou those (their wish obeying) Whom to greet, thy heart doth burn? Hast thou those who chide thy staying, And round their hearth thy absence mourn? Young Shepherd. I have a Father, good and tender, Brothers prized, and Sisters kind; I have a Mother, Heaven defend her! And one other love behind. Old Shepherd. Ah! Thy sickness I discover! Shepherd Youth, my blessing take; And may happiness, for ever, In thy breast her dwelling make. To seek the home he loved, the Youth had turn'd, When, hastening nigh, a warrior man they spied. Up he advanced and spake. âThe Foe is near! âIn the past night, fast to our Snowdon top, âLlewellyn, hope of Cambria, hath escaped. âTo rouse the fever in each Briton's vein, âI bear the tidings.â With an instant gush Of patriot love, each Shepherd look'd to heaven. Each, to the air, cast his inglorious crook. The Old Man shouted. âSnowdon, to thy brow âInstant I speed.â The Youth, with struggle hard, Faintly replied. âFirst, I must seek my home. âThat treasure safe, and I will grasp the sword, âAnd with my country live, my country die!â He hastened on, and now, from his loved hill, He look'd into the valley, to behold His home, his cot, send up the curling smoke, As erst, amid the trees. He saw it not! Faint apprehensions, quick repress'd, arose. With step that bounded with elastic tread, He skimm'd the mountain's side. His heart within Misgiving, he his eager footstep check'd. The moss-grown roof he fear'd. With hands half rais'd, Slow he drew near. The door wide open stood, But no melodious voice welcomed him in!â All there was stillâa freezing solitude! In shivering agony awhile he stood! He turn'd! He wept! Ah! Deeper is his grief. The brook, all foam, he thought it streak'd with blood! And with a ghastly eye, momently look'd To see some friend, borne on its boisterous wave. Immersed in thoughts of horror, still he stood, When by the Cottage door, near to his own; (One Cypress shadowing both) trembling he saw A new-rais'd grave, under the well-known tree! Toward it he rush'd. Upon the bark he read: Stranger! With sorrowing heart draw near To heave the sigh o'er fallen worth; As sweet a Tenant slumbers here, As ever prest the lap of earth. âWho? Who?â he cried. No living form was near. The Trees no answer gave; the Brook, so loved, Whose every wave he knew, deaf to his griefs, Impetuous rolled along; the air was still! His starting eye-balls round and round he roll'd In agonized uncertainty, when, lo! A humble grey-flag monumental stone Told the sad taleâIt was his True-Love's Grave! Against the Cypress old, long time he lean'd. To earth and all its scenes, heedless as she Who on the peaceful turf rested beneath: When Lincoln, seeking straggling Hind, drew near. Absorbed in dreams profound, he spies the youth; He seizes him and bears him to his King. Edward exclaim'd, as th' drooping Youth advanced, âWhat knowst thou of Llewellyn?â He replied, Roused by a sudden impulse in his heart. âWhen swords and spears grow on the beechen tree, âI will disclose what of my Prince I know.â âStrip him!â the King exclaim'd, âhis heart shall bleed! âHither the Archers! Let them draw their strings âHome to their chests, and send him to his grave.â The Youth is stripp'd. The archers, in the front, Stand, pointing death. Edward exclaim'd, âWithhold! âBefore you twang your bows, one word is mine. âThis moment answer, or the next too late! âWhere is Llewellyn fled? Tell me what course âThy Prince pursued. Instant! or death be thine!â The Cambrian cried. âWhen I forsake my Prince, âMe may my God forsake! What course he took âLies buried here, impenetrably deep. âNow let the arrows twang! I am prepared!â âEnough!â the King exclaim'd. âKing Edward was a penetrating Prince, beyond any at that time in the world.âBayle. âI do collect âAll I require. Thou own'st that he is fled, âBut dost disdain to tell the course he took, âI know the course! Snowdon alone the spot! âThere only he is fled, for there alone âMight he find transient safety. Noble Hind, âI honour thee. Safe journey on thy way. âI should have mourn'd to slay a youth so brave.â To his surrounding chiefs, Edward thus cried, âLet Conway stand! The branch is innocent. âIf we the trunk subdue, the limbs must fall. âInstant for Snowdon! Ere Llewellyn pause, âWe will ascend up to that mountain height, âAnd 'mid the clouds hurl the impetuous dart. âOur fathers trembled at the steep ascent, âEdward will dare it ere the sun descend.â They march toward Snowdon. Lo! a Band appears Fast-speeding to the King. All wait, perchance, The instant combat. Warwick hastens on! âHail! noble Earl!â Edward, advancing, cried. âTho' firm and confident, in this our strength, âMore satisfied e'en Edward feels himself, âWhen such a Chief, in such an hour, is nigh.â Whilst journeying on, to gain old Snowdon's heights, Warwick declared his progress in the war, His march thro' Dinevawr, what Holds he seized, What Castles levelled, and what Battles fought. Edward he told, how from Lhanurst he fled Thro' secret avenues, begirt around By Cambria's Prince. He spake of Eleanor, The Captive Maid, De Montford's beauteous Child; How he had rescued her from Talbot's power, And borne her on from Gloster. He declared Her sorrows, and the tears she hourly shed To be releas'd, and sent to Cambria's Prince, Her plighted Lord. âPardon me,â Warwick cried. âSuch woe severe, and such affection true, âSuch beauty, and so sweet a spirit mild, âNever before I saw. I could have loved, âBut honor and the oath at knighthood sworn, âKept down the flame. Then pity in my heart âLuxuriant rose. It might have moved a rock âTo see such loveliness bathed in her tears. âI cried, âO Maiden! I, by Edward sent, âAm now about to scourge the Cambrian Land. âThou, with thy Damsel, shalt my path attend, âAnd at convenient time, e'en the first hour âThat offers, when among the Land of Hills, âThee, to Llewellyn, truly will I send; âAnd, till that hour, beneath Earl Warwick's spear, âAnd, guarded by his honor, thou art safe.â âWe at Lhanurst arrived. Fill'd with surprise, âThat night, Llewellyn, 'mid our Castle walls, âBegirt us, and perchance, e'en I had fall'n, âBut for that secret path of which I spake. âThence, when I fled, the Maiden Eleanor, âI left with her attendant, to rejoice âLlewellyn with his unexpected prize. âIf I have err'd, O Monarch, pardon me!â Edward exclaim'd. âBrave Earl receive my praise! âThou art a true-born Knight. Thy heart was form'd âWith me, in Palestine, where thou didst learn, â(And in our wanderings thro' Earth's various climes) âThe spirit mild of courteous chivalry. âThou hast most nobly done! I do deplore âThat when I heard of Eleanor, betroth'd âE'en to our foe, and in the course of things âMade captive, that I sent her not, secure, âTo him she loved: Th' omission of thy King, âThou hast repaired, and my heart honors thee! âThou spak'st of Talbot!â Warwick sudden cried. âA coward and base man! Once with my spear, âI beat him to the earth, and when we meet, âI will pronounce him traitor, and again âMeasure the lance. He Gloster's towers resign'd, âMost dastardly. Not e'en a dart exchanged. âAnd when Llewellyn with a daring hand âHis passage forced, and shouted victory! âThe coward, in amaze, precipitate, âPlunged in the circling mote! headforemost fled, âI know not whither, but Earl Warwick swears, âWhen next they meet, to slay, or to be slain. âWhen Brecknock's sturdy castle I subdued, âI found the men Llewellyn prisoners made, âTaken from Gloster. They disclosed such scenes âOf that Arch-Hypocrite and Traitor vile, âThat when thou hear'st these men (they now are near âAmid yon ranks) thine eyes with wrath will beam, âAnd thine indignant heart glow with disdain.â Edward exclaim'd aloud, âListen, Brave Earl! âCambria's famed Bards Talbot unshrinking slew, â(Thus swelling his stupendous hill of guilt) âYea, slew them in cold blood. Now do I find âThat Cowardice and Cruelty are join'd, âIndissolubly firm. One spirit theirs. âWhen we the Cruel Man behold, assured âThere do we see a Coward! To the strong, âAbject! and to the weak, fierce! pitiless! âMercy should be estranged from this my breast: âHe should be hang'd up to some mountain oak, âBut that, self-murder'd, he hath foil'd our rage. âAltho' beyond the sword which Justice wields, âHis name shall perish, save in that dark scroll âWhere cowards, and assassins, and the base, âFind refuge, till oblivion drinks them down. âKnow, noble Earl, we must our hearts prepare âFor fiercer combat and more deadly strife. âWe haste toward Snowdon, where Llewellyn waits, âAnd shame, or vict'ry.â Warwick answer made, âTo lift the warrior's lance, this is my joy.â And now to meet the Cambrians they pass on, With firmer step and hearts more resolute. The base of Snowdon, lifting its proud head Above the line definable of sight, Now have they reach'd. Hill piled on hill it seem'd, Barren and bare, where scarce the blade would grow, Whilst the wild-thyme shrunk from its bleak abode, Just peeping from the fissures of the rock. Placid and still, from some protuberant And age-worn crag, with lifted horn sedate, And beard long-flowing, the majestic goat, With naught of fear, gazed on the multitude; Doubtful, as it might seem, whether to stand, And, by brave hardihood, th' obtruders daunt, Or flee to other eminence remote, Among the mountains, cave or pathless wild. Save here and there a solitary form Thus gazing, buried in the mine of thought, Nothing of life appear'd, o'er that wide track Where Desolation seem'd to make her home. Earl Lincoln, toward the King, bending drew near, Thus he began. âMonarch! my hairs are grey. âPardon my words! This is a Wilderness, âWhere nothing but a Cambrian may exist, âSave yon grey goats that gaze thus thoughtfully. âO King, if thou should'st hear, calmly, my words, âAscribe not aught to dread; I know it not, âBut to concern and deep solicitude âFor thee and thine.âLet not thy steps ascend âThese mountains wild! Dangers, beneath the turf, âLie hidden, hazards perilous, and traps âFatally deep. I am grown grey in war. âI follow'd to this spot thy Sire of old. âTriumphant was our march, till here we found, âI blush to own, discomfiture! We fled âBefore the Cambrians' valour. Well they knew, âWhere to plant ambush, and unseen molest âOur wilder'd footsteps. If thou dare these heights, âI tremble for thy fame! Hear me, my King! âWere it not wiser to surround this hill; âTo hem our stubborn Foe on every side; âTo build the fort; to rob them of supply; âTo waste their lands; to cut off all escape; âAnd starve them to subjection? Hunger's pang, âDown to the dust, will bring the loftiest heart, âAs the frost tames the wildest wing of heaven. âMost noble Potentate, ere thou resolve, âPonder these things.â Edward indignant cried, âLincoln! I know thy heart or I should deem âAll that thou-say'st, offspring of cowardice. âNot dare these hills! by lurking dangers scared! âThou know'st me not! Dangers and toils at bay, âMy spirit thrives among the hazardous, âAnd 'mid exploits that make the Coward quake! âIf my Forefathers found defeat and shame, âWhen daring Snowdon's heights, he who succeeds, âWhere others fail'd, stands on superior ground, âAnd seizes Fame for his inheritance. âTho' spears were countless as the summer fly, âI would disdain them, and still urge my way, âUp this proud Snowdon, to the Foe in arms! âThou talk'st of rearing forts, of hemming in, âBy patient perseverance, Cambria's Prince; âNay, I will meet him boldly in the field. âShould e'en our tardy spirits shun the fight, âAnd here the castle raiseâaround these hills âGather our strength, whence must our food arise? âIs there a living spring beneath our feet? âOr must we, like Heaven's dew, gather our bread, âFrom the compassionating Elements? âThis instant, I will mount and meet the Foe.â Lincoln, obeisant stoop'd, and now the Host Ascend, with toilsome step, up the steep side; Edward the foremost; and, by unsubdued And ceaseless hardihood, now have they pierced The belting clouds that half-way veil the mount, And onward still they press their toilsome course. Gladdening the sight, the turrets now they spy Of Dolbadarn's aerial eminence; Whence first the Cambrians saw the Foe advance. As England's waving banner shew'd itself, Thus to Llewellyn, earnest, David spake. âGive me some daring Band, I will haste on âTo yonder brow, and meet the Enemy, âWhilst thou draw forth all slaughter instruments, âAnd brace the spirit of our noble race, âHere in this Castle. Edwall, my brave Friend, âHe shall support me, and our swords shall teach âEdward our Foe, how Cambrians, on these hills, âFight lion-like, for all that cheers man's heart.â âGo!â cried Llewellyn. Harass their ascent! âFrom yon uplifted pinnacle supreme, âSend the huge stone, bounding from hill to hill, âThe lance and dart. I, for the keener strife, âStraight will prepare, and victory or death âCambria shall know, ere yonder sun descend.â The choice is made. David propels himself, (Young Edwall by his side, courting the strife) Thro' the wide gate, follow'd by valourous men, Impetuous for the strife, and forth they speed Toward th' assailing Foe, that upward still Urges his footsteps. David, from above, Sends the fast-rolling stones, many and huge, Bounding, that in their course scatter'd dismay, And sudden death, wide thro' the English host, Check'd by naught human, in their ponderous flight. Still boldly they ascend; and now the dart, In nearer contact, whizzes thro' the air, As the lance rattles on the burnish'd mail. David impetuous cried. âFollow my steps! âI will descend down to the English ranks, âAnd like the storm, amid the forest leaves, âDrive these our Foes down Snowdon's craggy side.â He said, and rush'd amid the thickest ranks, His hardy veterans pressing on his heels. And now the fight begins!âbitter and keen!â All horrible and deadly sounds ariseâ Dart, spear, and lance, and buckler, sending forth Their varied discord, whilst the busy sword Incessant falls and rises, gleaming far, Inebriate with man's gore. Bold-hearted Prince! Thou art entangled now! Edward is near!â Before whose might, spirits the stoutest fall, Like snow (on some December's cheerless morn) From trees wide-branching, dropping in huge flakes From limb to limb, when from their brief repose The winds arise. Edward the Cambrian meets. Two hungry panthers of the waste less fierce! Blow follows blow!âDavid his buckler drops! His wounded arm hangs senseless, and, at length, Prostrate he sinks on earth! Young Edwall near, Espies his Friend's extremity. His sword Rushes to aid him! Warwick starts between! And now the Briton and the English Earl Contend for mastery. Hard is the strife! Fierce and most vehement!âYoung Edwall falls!â To save his friend, never to rise again, The true, the brave, the valiant Edwall falls! âPursuit! Pursuit!â sounds on all sides, when lo The Cambrians fleet as air haste up the hill, And toward Llewellyn rush, bearing the news Of their disaster and Prince David's fate! Edward (the day secure) David demands. David appears, pale as the dewy cloud! His blood had flown, and languor, not of heart, Sat on his brow. Edward aloud exclaim'd, âTraitor to me thy Prince! Now shalt thou taste âThe fruit of Treach'ry, for, by Highest Heaven, âI swear thy heart's-blood ere an hour shall flow!â David replied. âO King! One crime is mine, âPre-eminent, that others veils in night, âFrom their contracted insignificance!â âAll others do partake of innocence. âEdward, I call'd my King! I swore to him âAllegiance and the homage of the heart! âForgive me, O my Country! Call me not, âTo thee, a traitor! Other treachery âMy spirit may endure, but, that my tongue âShould pledge its faith to thy most bitter foe!â âThat I should lift my sword against thy breastâ âThe breast that nourish'd me!âThis last offence, âSo deadly in the sight of man and Heaven, âForgive me, O my Country! Now, O King! âThy pardon!âI would gorge the molten brass âRather than crave it. I am in thy power! âI shrink not from my doom. I covet death. âBut there is one behind, who will return âTo thee and to thy raceâto this whole hostâ âTo England, who would lord it o'er our land, âDestruction to the uttermost, dismay, âAnd vengeance, sweeping as the wintry blast.â Edward exclaim'd. âNo parley here I hold, âNor shall thy uncouth rage quench my resolves. âDavid! Thou sufferest, not that thou, this day, âArt vanquish'd in fair fight. There were in that âTitle to credit and chastised renown;â âBut for dishonor to thy lawful Prince! âFor treachery and the solemn oath abhorred! âFor that thou didst receive, at this my hand, âKnighthood, and Edward own thy King, then turn âThine arms upon thy Monarch. David, know, âNot as a Cambrian, but an English Knight, âThou suffer'st, and the sentence Justice owns. âIf deeds, like thine, O Man, should find excuse, âWhat crime would merit death? Prepare the axe! âBear him to yonder smooth and jutting crag, âAnd sever, from his trunk, his trait'rous head!â David replied. âAt hour, like this, O King! âIt were unwise to cherish wrath, and speak âWith fierce recrimination. I would check âThe ardour of a mind, prone to rebel, âAnd my last moments calm to placidness. âI could have wish'd, if Heaven had seen it meet, âTo live, till that bless'd day, when, in her pride, âAnd shouting victory, Cambria rear'd her head, âTriumphant in her excellence of power; âThis blessing is denied. One boon I crave. âEdward will not refuse a dying prayer!â âMy Friend! My Brother! Edwall is no more! âBrave Edwall, thou art slain! Thy blood hath flow'd âTo save thy David. In thy prime thou fell'st! âO Edwall! (joy of her who brought thee forth, âHenceforth, th' ordained child of wretchedness!) âThou wast most dear to me! Thy pleasant voice âWas music to my ear! Our hearts, thro' life, âWere knit together. O, my fallen friend! âMy brother! For thy fate doth David mourn! âSay, Edward! Wilt thou spurn my earnest prayer? âAs we were one in life, Edwall and I,â âThe better He!âO let one grave be ours! âWhen I am dead, place me beside my friend. âIn death our bonds will last, and our remains âShall mingle, till the Trump of God shall sound!â Edward, amid his breast, felt conflict hard. Mercy, within his heart, held a high seat, But Justice had a voice. Edward's resolve Now half relax'd, when, thinking of the crimes That hung on David's headâhis treacheryâ The fierceness of his spirit when let looseâ His scorn of vows and solemn covenantsâ His havoc in the war, loud he exclaim'd, Tearing the words from his rebellious heart, âIt must be done! My vow, my oath is past! âLead him away, lest my fix'd spirit melt, âAnd I the coward practise to myself. âHence! Bear him off!â David is borne away! His neck is bared! âLet me behold,â he cried, âEdwall, before I die!âDear bleeding corse! âAnd is this he, whose eye was like the light!â âWhose limbs the nimble antelope outstripp'd!â âWhose frame was as the oak's stability! âIs this the young, the generous, and the braveâ âThe noble Edwall!âHe, whose spirit shrank âFrom the unmanly thought, and in whose heart âAll virtues throve, their native element! âCan this be he who whisper'd oft of Heaven, âWho fear'd not, in a scoffing world, to own âFaith in his Maker, and a confidence âIn his most precious Sonâthe refuge now, âTo which I fly, a sinful man! when earth, âAnd all its vanities, fade from my viewâ âThat hopeâthe only sunshine of my breast! âAre these the lips, from which unceasing flow'd âWisdom, and melting words of sympathy, âAnd kindness, tender as the dew of Heaven! âIs this my Edwallâhe whose heart to me, âTeem'd with affectionâmangled thus and bare! âMust I too, when a few more pulse have beaten âLie senseless on the chilling earth, and wear âThis hue of death!âThe spirit hence is flown, âThis is not Edwall! In celestial worlds âHappy he roams, and I will join him there! âNow do thy office!â From his o'ercharged eye, The axe man wiped the tear, and as the Prince, E'en David, on the rock, stretch'd his bare neck, His axe he raised and, with one furious blow, Sever'd his head!âRushing impetuous on, A man is seen! Young Stanley hastens near! âStop!â He exclaim'd. âWithhold thy instrument! âSpare David! I from Edward respite bring!â Mercy too late arrives! The deed is done! David hath bid adieu to all below! When on the sanguine turf, wounded and faint, David lay stretch'd, him Stanley eager sought, And with the feeling eye, and soothing voice, Cheer'd him, and bade his spirit not despair. âI will entreat of Edward,â he exclaim'd, âThy life and liberty. I know his heart, âRelenting, save in wrath's first fiery gust.â Young Stanley rose, and eager sought the King. âSpare him!â On bended knee, thus he began. âMy life to him I owe. High Potentate! âLike the Most Merciful hear thou my prayer!â âOff!â Cried the King. âThe man, who takes our robe, âWe hang, remorseless; shall we traitors spare?â âEven one, like him, form'd to set worlds on flame? âWho hath so wrong'd our confidence! One hour âSworn true allegiance, and the next, our spoils âSeized on, our castles, late by valour won!â âThe lion of the wilderness is trapp'd! âCease! Bear thy sorrow to some friendlier mart! âI scorn it! As thou livest, he shall die! âHither! Conduct the Cambrian to our sight!â Stanley, with sadden'd brow, heard Edward's voice. Then, sighing, back retired, smiting his breast, And wander'd forth, alone, to the far crag. Ah! Who is she that hastens toward the King?â Wilder'd her look, and eager gazing round, An infant clinging to her unrobed breast, And by her side, a boy with piteous mien?â David's fond Wife! âTell me, aloud she cried, âWhere is your King? Let me address his ear! âSay! Where is Edward?â Stanley saw and rush'd, Eager to seek the sorrowing woman, wild. âHere! Speed!â He cried. âI will conduct thy steps âTo Edward! Thou shalt plead, nor plead in vain!â Onward she hastes. The King, at length she sees. âO, tell me!â She exclaim'd. Where is my Lord? âPardon him, noble Monarch! Spare a life, âMost dear to me and to these Innocents!â At the soul-moving sight of woman's tears, Of children weeping, earnest looking up, Edward's firm soul relaxed. âGranted,â he cried. âAllay thy grief! Stanley, my herald thou! âSpeed to the captive! Stay the fatal deed! âLose not a perilous moment in thy flight!â Young Stanley, ere the last word utterance found, Rush'd, with the tidings beaming from his eye.â Back he returns, slow, gazing at the earth. âHast thou convey'd our respite?â Edward cried. Stanley, his soul within melting away, Trembled, and strove to speak, at length he cried, âDavid is dead!â A sudden shriek of woe Unutterable, burst from David's Wife! Frantic she cried! âDead! Is my David dead! âO King, in tenderness, let me too die! âAnd these poor babes!â A flood of bitter tears Choak'd utterance. Edward pour'd th' impetuous groan. âIt is too much for mortal man!â He said. âO war! Thy fruits are these! Bear her away! âBe courteous to the sufferer! Sooth her grief! âAnd when the wars shall cease, we will devise âWelfare for her, and for her orphan boys!â âNow other scenes await! âYon towering spires, âEre we have time to touch on softer strings, âFirst must be ours. Thro' the fast coming night, âThis be our resting-place. Upon the morn, âNew triumphs wait us! Now, while pity sighs, âAnd by the light of the faint-glimmering star, âBeneath this mountain turf, we will entomb âEdwall and David.â Lo! A man draws near, Ancient, and with a harp of massy frame. Edward aloud exclaim'd. âI know him well,â âLhyrarch, the Cambrian Bard!â As he advanced, The King approach'd and spake. âWithhold thy prayer! âNew sorrow would be mine, to hear thee plead, âIn Pity's voice, for David.âHe is dead! âBehold his corse outstretched, and by his side, âThe valiant Edwall! In the gust of wrath, âThe voice went forth, and now too late I mourn.â âIn this my breast anger too deep hath dwelt. âWould that the end, the union of our lands, âSo needful, I, with purer joy, had reach'd. âIt is a bitter moment, and sore pangs âAnd pungent I do feel, piercing my heart. âBard! Known and honor'd, Edward supplicates! âThere lie thy friends, no more! As the last rite, âThis hour we bear them to their final home. âSing thou the ritual hymn, the song of death; âI too will be a mourner.â On the bier The dead are placed. Lhyrarch, to earth estranged, In steadfast vacancy, o'er dart and lance, Plume, buckler, warrior, gazed. No word he heard; No object saw. The veil of night drew near; Silence around. His spirit back returns! When, from his languid orb, a fearful beam Shot, whilst he gazed upon the corse beneath. The sigh sent forth, hard labouring, from the depth Of th' unseen heart, sudden, he swept the chord. Tho' sorrow mark no cheek but mine, Tho' hostile spears around me shine, Shall the Bard his thoughts dissemble, Or at danger deign to tremble, Whose presence (freedom-like) alone Shakes the despot on his throne?â Bard! Who holds the sacred lyre, Prodigal of Earth's applause, To whom, in Truth and Virtue's cause, The Highest delegates his fire? Shall he to idols lift his handsâ He flattery to the abject breathe, Who 'mid the humble, humblest stands, And on the proudest looks beneath? Pretenders vile may touch the string, And incense to the tyrant raise, Who buys, for gold, his worthless praise; But who, at Inspiration's spring, Drinks deep and feels the power within, Mines, in vain, might strive to win. Like the Sunshine and the Sun Liberty and Bard are one. He, while cowards feel despair, The pinnacle of Right shall dare. If ever Slavery should maintain An empire boundless as the Main, To his breast, no fortress higher, Independence shall retire, And to a threatening world, reply But, with the disdainful eye. O scorn! No more deform my brow, Milder thoughts oppress me now. This day hath closed the mortal span Of a great, a gallant man; Old in fame, tho' young in years, For whom a thousand sighs arise, Faithful, generous, valiant, wise, For whom are shed a thousand tears. Hark! The Spirits of the Air, They who weep o'er human woe, With the hurrying hand, or slow, Wake by turns the note of care; Now declining, now ascending, With the midnight gale blending, For David is dead, On the bier lies his head, And his corse we convey to the Home of the Dead. Whilst to earth our friends we bear, Whose sun below no more shall rise; What so soothing and so fair As the planet-spangled skies? When, as the deepening shade prevails, Night her sister Silence hails And Heaven's verge, in sober grey, Lengthens long the closing day. Such scenes profound instructions yield, Deep truths are to our hearts reveal'dâ Soften'd, mellow'd, taught to feel That Nature, Nature's wounds can heal. While glows the concave, calm and clear, Our little mole-hills disappear; We forget affliction's wave, The worm, the mattock, and the grave. Amid the hour, to mourning due, A gentle joy the heart beguiles; As around she scatters rue, Sorrow, for a moment smiles. Tell me, men! Who roam to see Sights renown'd of majesty, What so grand as here to bow, Thus on Snowdon's awful brow, Raised so high, scarce knowing where, Suspended like a lamp in air, When no forms arrest the sight, But the sailing clouds of night, Or the countless orbs that shine, Thro' the canopy divine;â Here some lonely planet fair, Many a well-known clustre there: Gems that stud the heavenly throne, (Which speak of worlds beyond our own;) View'd with rapture oft of yore, Yet now lovelier than before;â Awe-inspiring as we gaze;â Whilst oft the vagrant Meteors blaze,â Some darting far their lines of fire Which, ere we look, in night expire; Some, like monarchs in their car, Gliding slow from star to star, To the subjects of their mind Paying visitations kind. Downward then to cast our eye, From our stand amid the sky, And view the misty vale below, Thro' which rivers many flow, Whilst, upon their winding streams, Day, expiring, faintly beams. Fill'd with thoughts of amplest sweep, We a holy silence keep, And, half, to our own selves, appear, Beings of another sphere, As we to Death had bent the knee, And quaff'd our Immortality. Roving Fancy, I abjure thee! Now substantial tears shall flow; O Prince! Before the grave immure thee, I will pour the song of woe. In her strength, for David's sake, The bold, the trembling harp shall wake. Why should friend the truth withhold The praise which from affection springs? Thou art fallen, thou art cold, Heir and hope of Mighty Kings! Our Tower of Strength is rent and low! A mourning country owns the blow! When last the sun arose sublime, We David saw, a mountain strong, Beneath his shade we march'd along, And dared the wasting hand of time. Him we thought ordain'd for praise, Cambria drooping, born to raise To some eminence of power, Great, as when our Roderi reign'd; That enwreath'd, immortal hour, When we the loftiest foe disdained; But our hero is fled, On the bier lies his head, And his corse we now bear to the Home of the Dead. Earth hath still her charms to boast, Some abiding, short-lived most; Such as to the soul pertain Spurn at life's contracted chain, Ocean narrow'd to a span! Germ of Heaven abides in manâ One little light to cheer his Cell, One spark of his primeval Mind;â Not all was lost when Adam fell, For Friendship linger'd yet behind. Edwall! in the prosperous day, Thou didst well thy truth display; And the adverse hour, for thee, Was to shew thy constancy. Thou in battle fierce wast torn From the man whom now we mourn. Here friend from friend must be divided, Like the sands on the sea-beat shore; But in a world, far-off provided, They shall meet to part no more! O, hear and rejoice, With your heart and your voice! Blessings, and great, For the good await, After the storms of this mortal state! Yet, O Edwall! Thou shalt greet Thy friend, with joyance new and sweet; His dross, his frailty left behindâ David, with a nobler mind, In a world, where all shall be Purity and harmony. This hope relieves the labouring breath, This reconciles the heart to death. Generous youth! So true, so brave, We consign thee to the grave, While the stifled groans reveal, That even foes for thee can feel.â These are honors due to none, But to High-born Valour's Son. Upon the bud that low doth lie, We bestow the passing sigh; But the youth, like morning red, Adorn'd with virtue's choicest bloom, Hurried to the silent tomb, Who beholds, nor droops the head? On the mound where he is laid, The Glowworm calm and constant shines, The broken bull-rush slow declines;â O'er the spot, so precious made, The Star of Evening lingers long, Whilst from the ancient yew-tree's shade, Thro' the stillness warbling clear, Till the first faint dawn appear, The Bird of Sorrow pours his song. Village Maidens, chaste as fair, Often bow in silence there; And let fall, memento true, Some sweet flower of tender hue. Even the Old Sexton, whom no common fate Stops in his road and leads to contemplate, Here pauses sadâfeels for a father's woe, And wipes the tear that will unbidden flow. Bear the rich remains away! As we march with solemn tread, We will think upon the dead, And for their souls devoutly pray. Lo! The hallowed spot we reach! The grave is deep! the grave is wide! This lonely sepulchre might teach Lesson stern to Human Pride. Lay the heroes side by side! They in life were friends sincere! They in death are joined here! Now place the sod beneath their head! Whilst each restrains the faintest word, Whilst not a breath prophane is heard, Gently earth upon them spread! Then, as the clods descending sound, One by one, in order slow; Let the Warriors, crowding round, With no idle pomp of woe, While I mourn, securely feel In their courage and their steel, For David is dead! Oh! His spirit is fled! And here, on the turf; rests his peaceable head. What a bubble all things are, Between this clod and yonder star! From youth to age we toil along, Against a thousand currents strong, Fierce to gain some gaudy prize, Which the world doth idolize;â Powerâthe source of killing care; Fameâa column raised on air; Wealth,âat best, a golden chain, Soon resign'd to men as vain; Dear-bought honor; things which be Weigh'd by wisdomâvanity! Whilst our moments swifter fly, Than the cloud of jagged form, Hurried fast before the storm, Thro' the warring wintry sky! Like the pageants of a day, All Earth's glories pass away! Rode there not upon the wind Warning notes, as mercy kind? Again the utterance! Whispers mild, Sent to Folly's thoughtless Child!â The tower on which the sun hath shone, The restless vapour sailing on, The falling leaf, the winged dart, The friend who cheers us soon to part, The blush of eve, the shadowy dream, The reed that floats upon the stream, The wave rough foaming up the shore, The voice of music heard no more;â The lightning fierce, the thunder dread, Of which remembrance long has fled; The thought that once disturb'd the mind, Now in the robe of twilight drest, Calm as ocean sunk to rest; The wind that leaves no trace behind,â These have a voice! Where now are found Names and Nations once renown'd? These emblem lifeâthese all impress, (In the hour of thoughtfulness) The spirit, with mysterious force, Like the unbound tempest hoarse, Raving in midnight! these declare How frail is man, what grass we are, Flowers at morn which charm the eye, And in the evening fade and die. Lo! To rouse our hopes and fears For things of small concernment never, Now secured or lost forever, A silent Monitor appears! From the Tomb, a Hand I spy, Pointing to Eternity! One leaf of cypress more I strew, And then the long, the last adieu. Sons of promise, your career Terminates in darkness here; Your rapturous joy, and your distress In the Grave's deep quietness! If my heart might cease to swell, For the cause in which you fell, From life, its cares, its thorny bed, Could I mourn that you are fled? Brief is sorrow! Brief is pleasure! You have had your destined measure, And to nobler life are born!â Till the Resurrection Morn. Whilst our tears around we shower, We commit you to that Powerâ Who spake, and, lo! From her repose Nature, in all her glory rose!â Who, in the silence of his thought, All worlds that areâfrom nothing brought! Lhyrarch his hand withdrew. No voice was hear'd. The breeze pass'd by, whistling shrill harmony, When all again was still! 'Mid the deep pause, A Youth advances slowly to the grave. Down ward he looks.âNot oft on hostile ground, Hath there a mourner stood, truer at heart Than Stanley, when he cried, âBrave Men, farewell!â BOOK XXIV. SCENE, The Castle of Dolbadarn. As David issued forth from Dolbadarn, Edward to meet, (young Edwall at his right, Seeking the bold exploit) Llewellyn cried. âDavid! restrain thy fire impetuous. âNot to subdue, but harass, thou art sent. âBe cautious, and if dangers great arise, âHither return. I, for a harder strife, âWill not be backward, and these gallant hosts, âThe hope and pride of Cambria, with a wave âResistless, shall, erelong, o'erwhelm the foe.â David replied. âThy words shall be my guide. âNow, O Llewellyn! on my sword rely, âAnd on the soberest dictates of a mind, âFaithful to thee. With my most gallant friend, âEdwall, this hour will we perform a deed, âGlorious, and such as Cambria long shall praise. âNow for the strife of men! Brother, farewell!â David and Edwall, and their gallant bands, Their swords unsheath'd, forth thro' the gate-way rush. Within Old Dolbadarn, on Snowdon's brow, Llewellyn, and his veterans fed their hearts On vengeance, and resolves of fiery rage. No idle spirit. Each his weapon seized; And sharpen'd sword and spear and massy axe; Halbert and javelin. Ah! the flight is seen! The Cambrians speed impetuous from the fray! Each with his utmost strength; some fleet of step, Some tardy, tho' all earnest, like the snow, Hastening to earth, when many a heavy flake Passes its lighter brother. On they rush. The gate is open'd! Wild, they enter in!â Amazement in their eye, death on their cheek! âAnd where is David?â Slow, Llewellyn spake. One forward came and cried. âEdwall is slain! âAnd David, wounded, by the Victor seized.â Llewellyn answer'd not. His cheek (till then Glowing) a pallid hue, sudden o'ercast. A momentary palsy of the heart Robb'd him of utterance. Twice he strove to speak, Then turn'd away, silent, and paced alone. Again he hastes. His eye, with fire illumed, Told of the burning thought. Aloud he cried. âVeterans! this hour my Brother is no more! âI know the wrath of Edward, his resolve âWhich altereth not. David once call'd him friend, âBut when the film was torn from his dim eyes, âBack to the land that gave him birth he fled. âIf ere the war should doom him, from that hour, âCaptive to Edward, death, immediate death, âWas his sure portion. This hath he endured. âHe breathes no more! His sun hath set in night. âCambrians! there is a spirit in our veins, âA flood within our hearts, that shall burst forth, âUntameable, and drench our foes in scorn. âMark me. The eve is near. When the morn breaks, âWe will haste forth, out on yon stony brow, âAnd boldly meet the Foe. We will retrieve, âBy valour of so stern and fierce a kind, âOur late discomfiture, that England's King âShall wither in the whirlwind of our rage.â A deafening shout ascends. âSoon as the morn, âWe will go forth to conquest and to fame!â His weapon and his heart, each now prepares. It was the dead of night. Upon his couch, Restless, Llewellyn lay, his mind oppress'd With the tumultuous thought. Amid the sky, (With many a cloud, sailing in sable pomp, Skirted with grey, or in fantastic shape, Of Hydras, or Night-roaming Dragons fierce) The horned moon appear'd, sending faint beams Thro' the barr'd windows. Silence deep was there, Unbroken, whilst the taper slept in air. All motion fled, save, glistening in their course, The motley sands, from the time-telling glass, Busily passing: these their way pursued, (Earnest, as is the eve-returning bird) Now cone-like gather'd, gliding wave-like now, Down the steep sides. The Prince beheld the sight, Musing upon the swift-wing'd course of time. The glass is stopped! The last sand now hath roll'd!â Llewellyn's heart felt chill as th' winter sky! Thoughts undefined, of dim perplexity, Obtrusive, cross'd his mind, that knock'd no more, Asking admittance; in tumultuous bands They entered, and his spirit made their home. His all at stake! His Sire's inheritance! His crown! His life! Death-like solemnity Pervades his heart!âThe rights of those he loved; His People's welfare; and his Sons unborn, Great as their Fathers, or abased and vile! Such thoughts, in mournful retinue arose! Whilst, well he knew, that blood erelong must flow In copious stream, and, o'er his subjects, Death Remorseless laugh, counting his thousands slain. Nor mused he not, with the cold-starting dew, On the uncertainty, who might survive. He thought upon himself.âA still small voiceâ Whisper'd! He turn'd to hear. He fear'd it not. There seem'd a loveliness, till then unfelt, In th' thought of death. Tho' serious thing it wasâ Most solemn, to put off this mortal robeâ A long adieu bid to the sun and stars, And fair Creationâon the earth, the head To rest, unconscious, and the limbs, once prized, Give to the worms!âTho' awful, passing thought, To meet the Judge of All, of Quick and Dead! Yet were these thoughts to him armed with no sting. Llewellyn call'd them in the sober walk, And, in the musing hour, midnight affords They were his theme, th' associates whom he loved. He served his Maker. He his Law revered, (Given in mercy to rebellious man, Wherein the full, broad road to happiness Is traced with sun-beams, whilst Futurity No longer sits in clouds.) The transient thought Pass'd thro' his mind, that if, in th' coming fray, The Almighty, Sovereign of the Lives he gave, Should call him from a state, wedded to care, He felt that he could sayââThy will be done!â That moment privileged of happy thingsâ Flies! and the cloud gathers once more around. Life yet had charms. For others, for himself, He wish'd to live,âto perfect mighty plans, Dear to his heart, and some faint chill he felt, Taking a gloomy survey of the grave, At its cold sullenness, lonely and dark! A depth unfathom'd, from which living man Shrinks! And looks up to gaze upon the sky. Affection too with spells, had bound his heart He linger'd o'er the present, still he clings To th' welcome reed that floats upon the wave, And, âSpare me! Spare me!â Trembling spake his heart. Steadfast he look'd in vacancy. His mind, To its interior cell, now had retired, And free he ranged o'er the ideal world, In a luxurious absence of all thought, Drown'd in excess. In visionary trance, As thus he lay, a Form advances slow, Whence, unperceived; not of the world we tread, The Hag of some strange planet, out, afar. With mists her robe was mingled; cloud it seem'dâ Thin as the half-moon in the mid-day sky, Whilst her unearthly face, long, lank, and seer, Streak'd with the line indelible of age, Lamp-like, stood prominent, whose lineaments, Declared th' unaltered purpose, whilst her eye, Deep in its socket, shone with sallow beam, As thro' the air, at object unreveal'd, Earnest she fix'd her sight. Amid the pause, Slowly she turns! She looks upon the Prince! Tho' steadfast are her eyes, her breath withheld, A voice is heard, faint as the rustling leafâ A palsying sound, shrill, bodiless, obscure, Allied to the converse of the Unseen World, When Grave to Grave whispers mysterious things. She spake! âFor death, the irrevocable doom! âPrepare! Thy Goal is near! Thy race is run! âThe Funeral Lamp, to light thy Sepulchre, âIs trimm'd and burning, and thy Winding-Sheet, âO Prince, behold!â Slowly the vision fadesâ Mixing with air! Llewellyn, from his couch, Starts! Whilst convulsions fasten on his heart. He stands aghast, then slowly looks around Once more to light upon the spectre formâ Darkness alone is there, and silence all! Earnest he cried, his soul again return'd, âWhat mean these fearful visions of the night, âAping Reality?â Llewellyn's heart Spurn'd at enthusiast dread, fume of the brain; Yet this aerial shape, he liked it not, The moment, (perils near) her form, her words. He rather would have dreamt the pleasant dream Of Life long-lengthen'd, fame and victory. At this peculiar hour, such wakefulness, Such freshness of the faculties was his, Cloudless, intense, pervading his whole mind, It seem'd new being, and an antepast Of th' immaterial world. Llewellyn now Felt at his heart new burden. Forth he goes With cold serenity, a sober joy Verging on pain, like who his long-loved Home, Once more beholds, haunts of his infancy, When many scenes, adverse, have passed between. With such subdued delight, Cambria's high Prince, Now seeks his Eleanor. He found the Maid Pacing alone, her Damsel stretch'd in sleep, The dim lamp burning. She beheld her Lordâ Silent, they fall into each others arms! Thus Eleanor began. âEdwall is slain! âAnd David, captive made, and on the morn âThou strivest with thy bitter Enemy.â Llewellyn earnest cried. âFirst Gem of earth! âBe not cast down. Edwall, alas! is slain; âDavid is captive made; and, on the morn, âLlewellyn grapples with his deadly Foe! âThis be thy joy! The moment hastens on, âWhen Cambria, for accumulated wrongs, âShall, from her prison heart, let loose her wrath, âAnd with her vengeance scare the Enemy. âPut off thy fears. Let not thy spirit grieve. âI come to lull thee, ere the fight begin. âDiscard thy terrors. Wear a look of joy. âOur thraldom hastens to a glorious end, âAnd Pleasure waits, with her o'erflowing cup, âTo sooth us for the sorrows we have known.â Thus Eleanor replied. âJoy of my heart! âFor thee have I forsaken friend and home, âAnd cross'd the seas and borne captivity, âWhilst, in Llewellyn's smile, my earthly hopes âCentred alone. Can I with placid heart, âThink of the raging fightâthe blazing swordâ âThe dart fast-speeding thro' the darken'd airâ âThe halbert and the lance!âAll deadly things!â âOn every side, wielding and scattering round âDeath and destruction! Noble and brave Prince, âCan I with heart unshuddering think, that thou, âEven thou art in the midst of these fierce scenes? âLlewellyn! What if some remorseless dart, âSome furious spear, should pierce thee in the fight! âTho' it be folly, pardon me, my Lord! âI must indulge these tears of bitterness!â Llewellyn cried. âThe Foe is worn with toil, âAnd we are fresh and eager for the strife! âWe, on our native hills, fight for our homesâ âThey are far distant from the land they love! âWe have the flower of Cambria, valiant men, âThronging around us, burning to repay, âFor wrongs and countless deeds of contumely, âThe debt of vengeance. They, with eager hearts, âSeek conquest, waste, and deathâWe nobly strive âFor justice, life, and liberty. One doubt âOf our success, can'st thou, O Eleanor, âIndulge with sadden'd brow? We must succeed! âIt is ordain'd by the fix'd course of things, âThat cause, like ours, must prosper and ascend âProudly o'er all impediment. Thy fears, âMaiden beloved, restrain! Fast comes the hour âThat gives us happiness.âThe dawn appears! âI must away! Nay check desponding thoughts, âMy Life! My Eleanor! Awhile farewell!â Weeping upon Llewellyn's arm she lay! âFarewell!â Again he cried. As thus he spake, Her hand relaxed. She sank upon her couch! Sighing, he pass'd away. Llewellyn rush'd, Shaking the milder feelings from his heart, Down 'mid his waiting veterans. Whilst the earth Dimness o'ercast, each for the battle paused. With cheek, still moisten'd with paternal tear, For his lost Son, (Edwall the young, the brave) Advancing, Anarawd his Monarch hail'd, Follow'd by Chieftains panting for renown, In wars matured, from Cambria's utmost verge, Who now, around their Prince, vindictive throng'd, Strength in their arms and vigour in their hearts, Resolved in one great contest, to surpass All former feats of fame, and whelm the Foe, E'en Edward and his fierce assailing host, In ruin and unutterable shame.â âOne word,â Llewellyn cried, âEre to yon space, âWe issue, and the vengeful sword unsheath.â Around their Prince the valiant Chieftains throng, Whilst nearer press the ardent Multitude, Anxious to hear their Prince, to catch his fire, And rush to war. Whilst silence reign'd around, Llewellyn to his Armies thus began. âMen, great in arms and high enroll'd in fame, âYour Country long hath honor'd you, and felt âIn your renown, stability and strength, âThat banish'd the faint semblance of dismay. âGreat are your deeds. A thousand generous songs âRecount your praise, and your brave Ancestors'. âIf ever pride sat graceful on man's heart, âYou she adorns, for all from Heroes sprang, âFrom champions and the illustrious sons of earth. âBrave Cassivellaunus and Caractacus, âWere our Progenitors; Carausius âCynetha and Allectus; men whose swords âVanquish'd the Roman Legions, and preserved, âWhen England crouch'd beneath the Conqueror's car, âSpotless, their liberty. Here, in these wilds, âAmong these mountains, Freedom stamp'd her foot, âAnd planted the tall spear, and from her limbs, âDisdainful, shook the chain. These were our Sires! âWhilst as the years roll'd on, new stars arose, âCrowding Heaven's galaxy, whose glory reach'd âEarth's farthest Nation. Einion, and that Chief, âConspicuous in each daring enterprise, âCaswallon, o'er proud Caledonia's sons, â'Mid Mona, lifted high the conquering lance. âThese rose to prop their country, with that name âDear to our Cambria, Vortimer, whose sword âDrove Hengist and his Saxon plunderers âBack to their savage wilds. A thousand suns âNow beam at once and throng our sky with fire, âLed by Pendragon and Ambrosius, âIn blood and valour brethren, with that man, âWhose name no Cambrian hears, but with a tear âOf starting rapture, and a thrilling heartâ âArthur! whose glory yet illumes our land. âThese were our ancestors! These, when the Foe âCame, like a wintry torrent, in their grasp âThe sword wide gleaming, to o'erwhelm our land, âRush'd dauntless on. The patriot's love endued âTheir swords with ten-fold fury, and at length, âThe assailants, from our hills, fled, clad in clouds, âAnd, safe, still trembled at Old Cambria's rage. âThese men, in their full plenitude of fame, âExultant sang. âOur foes are quench'd in shade! âOur enemies, all towering, are subdued! âThey met us, and have sunk in endless night!â âThere is a spirit in our mountain air! âWho breathes it, feels arise within his heart âCourage, and appetite of fair renown, âAnd thirst of liberty, unquenchable. âThese sons of valour, in their pride, exclaim'd, âOur Offspring, when the evil hour shall come, âThinking of us, shall lift their gleaming swords, âAnd on their foes destruction hurl and death. âWe are these heroes' sons! that foe appears!â âAnd we have now to build the lofty name, âAnd garland it, and send it fragrant down âTo distant ages, that our sons unborn âMay talk of us and emulate our fame. âCambrians! the day is come, the strife is near, âThat shall extinguish, or exalt our names âEven to the skies. We must triumphant shout ââVict'ry!â and make all Cambria swell our praise, â(In an undying peal) from mount to mount, âOr, buried in deep shame, o'erwhelm'd in night, âPerish, and give our memories to decay! âI may not doubt the issue. Noble men, âThis contest o'er, this our last struggle past, âWe, to our distant homes, forth may return, âAnd, 'mid the wife and children of our hearts, âTalk of our deeds, when we proud Edward scourged; âAnd, circled by prosperity, instruct âOur list'ning sons of the most precious debt âThey owe their country, when new foes arise, âTo die, or triumph. Edward, England's King, âHath lived in tumults from his infancy. âIn unfledg'd years, against our native hills, âHis lance he lifted, but we sent him back âO'erwhelmed with shame. That moment in his heart, âSank the deep resolution, when matured âBy age and by experience, to attempt âAgainst Old Cambria some austere exploit, âE'en her subjection. To increase his might, âOn Afric's shore he foughtâ'mid Palestine, âAnd when he thought his vengeance perfected, âHe hasten'd back, to wield again the spear, âAnd shake the Cambrian Lion by the mane! âWe are prepared to meet him! In our veins âStill flows the blood of Brutus. We have hearts, âNot aliens from our soil. We know to prize âThe hills, where freedom and content disport, âAnd carol songs of joy! Our breasts are fired âWith ardent love of heaven-born liberty! âWe spurn the bond-man's chains! Cambrians, arise! âBy all the love you bear your peaceful homes! âBy the sweet music of your native rills! âBy glorious aspirations of renown! âBy the supreme affection you sustain âFor your loved wives and helpless innocentsâ âYour aged siresâyour children, yet unbornâ âRise! Cast the cumbering scabbard to the wind! âThe mists disperse! The sun illumes our path! âRush on to victory! and let our Foe, âEdward, and yonder host, waving the lance, âPerish beneath the blast of our disdain!â Old Snowdon, to her stony centre, shakes With the acclaim, e'en the loud-pealing shout, That rent the element! and now they rush Impetuous forth to meet the Enemyâ Lhyrarch, the while, pouring the ardent song. Too long the yoke hath Cambria borne; Now, in patriot strength mature, She wakes from grief! She scorns to mourn What the Warrior's sword may cure! From our slumbers, lo! we rise!â We will lay the lofty low; And with our lightning-armed eyes, Scare the iron-hearted Foe! Sons of Valour! Sons of Fame! Roused from her abased state, Cambria now shall vindicate The honors of her ancient name. In the days which are no more, Cambria oft her might display'd, She reveal'd her glittering blade, And from her rock-encircled shore, Thick-cover'd with the vanquish'd slain, Drove the Norman and the Dane. Spake I, of the daysâno more? Manes of the Mighty Dead, Pardon ye the word I said! Till the rounds of Time are o'er, Like the planet of the sky, Your glorious days shall never die! What the nation of the earth, That, in all her pride, hath given, Like our Cambria, Heroes birth, Sent and sanctified of Heaven? From the realms of dazzling light, Souls august and ever dear; From your bless'd empyrean height, See! we march to launch the spear! Arthur! we thy prowess own, Thy sons, aspiring, think of thee; Bulwarks round their Fathers' throne Ten-thousand Arthurs now I see! Yes! great and valiant were our Sires, Noble in the rolls of fame; Whose memory, Cambria still inspires. To triumph or to die the same. Burst not from your marble rest With the fierce upbraiding eye! We are now in vengeance drest, And the hour of strife is nigh! Foes and great before us rise! Edward's daring hordes I see!â Lo! the frighted Lion flies, Whelm'd in scorn and infamy! Beneath the banners of the brave! Fast our valiant Hosts advance, To wield the sword and hurl the lance, Whilst hovering Wolves their banquet crave; Dainty food they soon shall share, With the Carrion Birds of air! The day, so long'd for, now is nigh, When, 'mid the rage of clashing shield, To us the Palm shall Edward yield!â He before our wrath shall fly, With wither'd hope and blasted fame, Sunk in everlasting shame! O ye Spirits of the Brave! High in Valour's annals hoary, While the beaming lances wave, On, your Children march to glory! Warriors!âview your mortal Foe! Yonder see him pressing near! He hastens to his last o'erthrow! He comes to feel Llewellyn's spear! Let the bloody Pennon wave! Now, the awful hour is nigh, Cambria! when, thy all to save, Thou must Vanquish or must Die! Edward, with earliest dawn, burst from his couch. His troops, impatient, marshall'd for the fight, Await his coming. To a spiring crag, Eager he hastes. âHear me,â aloud he cried. His chieftains, and his warriors round him throng, Clad in bright mail, the high progenitors, Thro' countless years, down to expiring time, Of England's Nobles, and the Sires renown'd Of those who learn their lofty pedigree, Not by damp scrolls, and records worn with time, But by th' ennobling thoughts and energies, That glow within their hearts and fire their veins. While all is silence, Edward thus began. âVeterans and friends revered, list to my words. âThe object of my life, my dearest hopes, âNow burst into fruition! I beholdâ âDriven to his last retreat, e'en on these hillsâ âTill now held sacred, and untouch'd of Foe, âLlewellyn and his host. Behold them there! âScared ere the fight begin. Thro' centuries past, âEngland hath borne often severe defeat, âBut ever insult, and unnumber'd wrongs âFrom these fierce dwellers on the mountains wild; âEver in armsânourish'd in blood and strife! âA feather, lifted 'gainst the passing wind, âRouses all Cambria into stormy rage, âAnd fills her warrior sons, not with a wrath, âSuch as we feel, but with inveterate ire,â âWith devastating fury,âwith revenge âImplacable, solaced alone with death. âWith these irascible and ice-bred men, âEngland too long hath borne. Our sires, of old, âOft partial triumphs gained, but, in the end, âThe foe exulted, whilst our warriors bled, âBootless, and in a few revolving years, âConquer'd again, only to yield at last. âThe welcome morn now dawns, when Cambria lives! âOr England falls! Such insults I have known, âSuch contumacious wrongs and treacheries, âWing'd with defiance, that my oath is pass'd, âForced by supreme necessity, O men! âTo subjugate, for us and for our heirs, âCambria, from shore to shore. The King who wields âAlbion's proud sceptre, may he not, unblamed, âWhen dared, insulted, like his valiant sires, âIn equal combat, meet his mortal foe? âYet views and hopes, far loftier, fill my breast. âIn humbling Cambria's Prince, I look beyond âAnd plan for our posterity. I live, âNot for vain boasts of conquest, but alone, âTo brace the sinews of our cliff-bound isleâ âTo mould a jarring and discordant state, âWeak, in its parts, combined, invincible, âThat shall present, to every future foe, âThe tower of strength, the front of adamant. âExperience, dearly gain'd 'mid foreign lands, âHath taught this lesson, and I lead you forth, âE'en now, amid these mountain elements, âBy deed at arms, and gallant enterprise, âTo prove the benefactors of your race. âWarriors! Believe your Prince. Tho' rough the road, âOn which you now, seeking the Cambrian, tread, âIt leads to happinessâfor usâfor them, âFor the whole land! When these my days are pass'd âAnd, on the verge of death's tremendous gulf, âShuddering I stand (with hopes of loftier kindâ âOf mercy and forgiveness from high Heaven,) âOne thought shall then irradiate the dark scene, âAnd cheer my spiritâthat, by steady aim, âUnshaken, I have scorn'd impediment, âAnd by th' achievements of this glorious day, â(For who shall doubt the issue?) torn the crown âFrom Cambria's brow and quench'd the torch of strife. âI then shall die, exulting, that our heirs âAre not to wade thro' blood, as we have done, âAnd 'neath the pillow ever plant the spear. âI then shall joy, that the laborious toilâ âA sad inheritance! shall never more âUpon our sons devolve, of grappling hard âWith these vindictive inmates of the clouds. âWe will perform th' inestimable deed! âOur sons shall live at ease, and when they see âConcord, where fierce contentions dwelt before, âThe borders of each realm teeming with life, âThe yellow corn-field, and the bending vine, â(Where now sterility, anguish, and fear âHold their resort, whilst pale-eyed Pestilence, âWalking her nightly round, launches unseen, âThe arrow, with destruction barbed, and death) âBeholding this transition, from black night, âTo cheerful noon-day, they shall praises heap âOn their victorious and determin'd sires. âThe isle is oneâso shall the monarch be! âOur enemies o'erthrown, peace may return, âBut while Llewellyn rules, whilst Cambria boasts âHer ancient princedom, whilst her spirit burns âTo conquer the fair land our fathers won, âWarfare must reign. Now is the glorious hour âTo consummate England's devoutest hope, âHer age-extended prayer, and by one feat, âThe pride of after years, Cambria subdue, âNever to rise again!âYet, even she, âHer first keen pang endured, with us, erelong, âShall join loud exultations, while she views âHer antique iron, and blood-rusted crown, âFor the gem-mantled coronet exchanged; âTerror, with all her train of searching fears, âFor permanence of joy. Behold the Foe! âHim whom our arms have driven, from hold to hold âE'en to these mountain heights. Unsheath your swords! âThe Cambrians hasten! Lo, the harp I hear, âOur friend be He who rules the universe! âI lead you to the fight!âGod and Saint George!â The English and the Cambrian ranks draw nigh: And now they stand, both in long line of arms, Facing each other, waiting for the trump, Onward to burst, and drench the field with gore. Llewellyn shouted, âAnarawd!â He comes. âGo!â cried the Prince, âto yon pernicious man, âYon Saxon, even Edward, and declare âLlewellyn dares him to the single fightâ âEven in the face of this vast multitude. âSaving the Christians' blood, tell him, aloud, âThis arm shall meet him, kingdoms for the prize.â With ardour, Anarawd prepared to speak. âGo!â cried Llewellyn. âParley I disdain! âAway!â The Cambrian Chieftain seeks the foe. The trump was raised, and the imperious breath Indrawn, to thunder forth the blast of war, When Anarawd appear'd, waving the flag, And seeking Edward. âStop!â The King exclaim'd. âA Cambrian hastens.â Anarawd drew near; When Edward spake, âThy purpose?â Bending low, The Chieftain thus replied.ââOur noble Prince, âLlewellyn, Lord of Snowdon, to the fight, âSingly, before this warrior multitude, âDares thee, O Edward!â Edward high in air His gauntlet cast, and with shout vehement, Answer'd, âI meet him! Let him forward haste! âBefore this host of gazers, we will join âInstant in mortal strife. Cambrian, away! âBear this my joyful message to thy Lord.â Earl Warwick hasten'd nigh, and, by his side, England's chief nobles. âHear me!â Loud he cried. âO King, restrain the fervour of thy soul! âThou art thy subjects' property! Thy life, âJustly, thou may'st not venture. Thou art here, âThe spirit of our cause; the head, the soul. âWere it thine own one interest, I would joy â(Nor doubt the issue) that our valiant King, âThe pride of England, dared, not Cambria's Chief âTo combat, but the Champion of the World. âLet me contend with Snowdon's lofty Lord.â âOr me!â âOr me!â From the encircling host, Came shouting forth. Edward, his spirit tamed To the subjection of his sovereign will, Calm, confident, with even voice, and eye Steady as solar beam, on Anarawd Gazing, thus answer'd. âTo Llewellyn, tellâ âEdward shall meet him in the coming fray! âThat be the hour of trial! To thy Prince!â Low bending, Anarawd, sedate, retired. Now thro' the air the shrill-toned trumpet sounds! At the loud signal for the clash of arms, Llewellyn and King Edward hasten on, Each breathing death. Like two imperious tides Swoln with the storm, or where broad Amazon, Toward the Atlantic pours his waters forth, Forcing a passage thro' a sea in arms: With such resistless fury, onward rush The hostile combatants! And now the lance, Impetuous, thro' the air flies whizzing on, Upon the target sounding, and full oft Sending to dust the sons of bravery. From the deciduous quivers, fast the darts Are thrown across the string, whilst ceaseless twangs Startle each ear. On Snowdon's rocky heights, Men drop like frosted leaves, swept by the storm, In autumn's yellow hour. The arrows still Fly thicker, whilst aloft the spears are hurl'd, Black passing lines, that ever, where they fall, Bear reckless fate. Llewellyn cries âThe sword! âCambrians! The sword!â He leads them to the fray. Now the vast tempest swells, and deeper tones Of horrid dissonance rush thro' the air. The buckler sounding loudâthe helmet's crashâ The shiver'd lanceâthe sword's shrill contact keen, Grating and harshâthe ponderous battle-axe, With dying groans and âMercy'sâ plaintive cry, From prostrate valour, all commingling rise, Rousing afresh to more stupendous wrath The warriors' furious arm! Transcendent deeds Of noble enterprise now are perform'd. Death, drunk with blood, reels, and forgets to count The multitudinous Ghosts which pass him by! Men, great in arms, for ever close their eyes, And 'mid the unheeded dead are trodden down, In pitiless confusion.âSpite of strength And courage form'd in valour's sternest mould, The Cambrian's arm is slack! Llewellyn piles Destruction round him, whilst throughout the field He traverses and lays the mighty low, Seeking the royal crest! Edward hastes on! The Lions meet! Ah! Now the fight begins! Llewellyn's buckler rings and Edward's shield Bears the deep scar!âblow, fast succeeding blow, From each, with crushing vehemence, descends!â Llewellyn's falchion snaps! While Edward's shield, Divided, falls to earth. The King, his sword Plunged at the Foe. The Cambrian's buckler wards The stroke of fate, and now, with arm to arm, Grappling, they strive! Such fearful vehemence Man ne'er surpass'd. âAvaunt!â The King exclaim'd. Llewellyn cried, âAvaunt!â Instant they part. A sword and shield from the surrounding heap, Sudden they seize, and rush again to arms!â Still fiercer is the conflict! Fighting men Forget their strife, and, wondering, turn to gaze Upon the furious combatants! His sword Llewellyn rais'd, and, with one vengeful blow, Put forth his latent nerve, resolved to bear All force before him, gorget, helm, and shield! Edward upraised his buckler; the fierce blow Alighted like Heaven's bolt! Awhile he reel'd, When, springing forward, with a sudden thrust, He plunged his sword, deep in Llewellyn's heart!â The Hero falls, and Cambria is no more! FINIS.</field>
