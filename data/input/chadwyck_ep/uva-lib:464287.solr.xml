Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored. To the right honorable his singular good Lord and Maister Sir Edvvard Seymoore. Knight, Baron Beacham, Earle of Hartfoord, and Lieftenant of his Maiesties Counties of Somerset and Wiltes. I. [O Lord thy faithfulnes and prayse I will with viole sing] O Lord thy faithfulnes and prayse I will with viole sing Thy laud and prayse O Israels holy King: My mouth wil ioy with pleasant voyce when I shall sing to thee, And eke my soule will much reioyce for thou hast made me free. II. [If euer haples wom? had a cause] [1] If euer haples wom? had a cause To breath her plaintes into the open ayre, And neuer suffer inward griefe to pause Or seeke her sorrow shaken soules repayre Then I for I haue lost my onelie brother Whose like this age can scarsly yeeld an other. 2 Come therefore mournefull Muses and lament, Forsake all wanton pleasing motions, Bede? your cheekes, stil shal my teares be spent: Yet stil increast with inundations. For I must weepe, since I haue lost my brother. Whose like, &amp;c. 3 The cruell hand of murther cloyde with bloud, Lewdly depriude him of his mortall life: Woe the death attended blades that stoode, In opposition gainst him in the strife, VVherein he fell, and where I lost a brother, VVhose like &amp;c. 4 Then vnto griefe let me a Temple make, And mourning dayly, enter sorrowes portes, Knocke on my breast, sweete brother for thy sake, Nature and loue will both be my consorts, And helpe me aye to wayle my onely brother. III. [When fr? my loue I lookte for loue and kind affections due] When fr? my loue I lookte for loue and kind affections due, To wel I fo?d her vowes to proue most faithles and vntrue For when I did aske her why Most sharpely she did reply That shee with mee did neere agree To loue but iestingly. Marke but the subtle policies that female louers finde, VVho loues to fixe their const?cies, like fethers in the wind Though they sweare, vow and protest, That they loue you chiefly best, Yet by and by theyle all denie, And say twas but in iest. IIII [Who doth behold my mistres face] [1] Who doth behold my mistres face And seeth not good hap hath he Who hears her speake &amp; marks her grace Shal think none euer spake but she In short for to resound her praise She is the fayrest the fayrest of her dayes. 2 VVho knowes her wit and not admires: shal show himselfe deuoide of skil, Her vertues kindle strange desires, In those that thinke vpon her stil. In short &amp;c. 3 Her red is like vnto the rose, VVhen from a bud vnto the sunne, Her tender leaues she doth disclose, The first degree of ripenes wonne, In short, &amp;c. 4 And with her red mixt is a white, Like to that same of faire moone shine, That doth vpon the water light, And makes the colour seeme deuine. In short &amp;c. V. [If there bee any one whome loue hath wounded] [1] If there bee any one whome loue hath wounded &amp; of the hurt is neere his death. If there bee any one in grief confounded &amp; stil with sighes doth fetch his breath. Such is my case let him com sit with me &amp; mourn Whome griefe doth gripe and Cupid blind doth ouerturne. 2 If there be any one which hath beene racked, And ioynt from ioynt is al to torne, If there be any one these pangs haue smacked, And in his heart with loue doth burne, Such is my case, come let him sit with me and mourne, For I am rackte and scorcht with loue &amp; left forlorne. 3 If there be any one in shippe oppressed, at pinch of wracke to drowned be: If there be any one with waues betossed, Or blinded that he cannot see, Such is my case, let him come sit with me and mourne, Whom shipwracke spoiles &amp; eyes put out, as louers scorn 4 If there be any one that fraude hath perplext, Or burst his heart at loues commaund, If there be any one, whome al greefes haue vext, Or in hels paines do dayly stand, Such is my case, let him com sit with me and mourne, That feeles hels paine and louers griefe with loues greate scorn. VI. [I heard of late that loue was falne a sleepe] I heard of late that loue was falne a sleepe To late alas I finde it was not so Me thoght I saw the little villain weepe, But theefe he laughs at th? that waile in woe, I dreamt his bow was brok &amp; he was slain But loe awakte I see all whole againe. His blinking eyes will euer be awake, His idle head is ful of laughing toyes, His bow and shafts are tickle thinges to take, It is no medling with such apish boyes, For they shal finde that in his fetters fall, Loue is a deadly thing to deale withal. Yet where the wretch doth take a happy vaine, It is the kindest worme that euer was, But let him catch a coy conceite againe, In frantike fits, he doth a fury passe, So that in sum who hopes of happy ioy, Take heede of loue, it is a perlous boy. VII [Al my wits hath will inwrapped] [1] Al my wits hath will inwrapped, All my sence desire in trapped. Al my faith to fancy fixed, All my ioyes to loue a mixed. All my loue I offer thee, Once for all yet looke on me. 2 Let me see thy heauenly feature, Oh heauens what a heauenly Creature, All the powers of heauen preserue thee, Loue himselfe is sworne to serue thee, Princesse in a Goddes place, Blessed be that Angels face. 3 Looke how loue thy seruant dyeth, Harke how hope for comfort crieth, Take some pitty on poore fancy, Let not fancie proue a franzie; Comfort this poore hart of mine, Loue and I and all are thine. VIII [Goe wailing verse the issue of thy fire] [1] Goe wailing verse the issue of thy fire Begot on sighes which vent from my torne heart Tel thou thy par?ts neuer quenchd desire, Tel of his griefes &amp; of his endles smart Tel of his passions and his sad laments How stil he sues hard she yet neere relents. 2 Deepe sobs the silent Orators of loue, Sad sighes the muttering ecchoes of my pain, Heart renting groanes the agent which would moue, Compassion with that checke bedewed raine. Raine which doth trickle from my watrie eyes, Hoping at length sheele heare my doleful cries. 3 But Oh would that sweete faire had been the butte For Cupid to haue aymde at with his shaftes, Then had not these my pations boulted out, Blasing my follies vnto wise mens hates. 4 But why wish I to Cupid so much good, When he hath broke his shafts and siluer bow, And finds a flame inkindled in my bloud, Which neither ise c? qu?ch nor mountain snow And sure no maruaile if he conquere men, when gods so faire a saint; haue neuer seene. 5 Her eyes like globes contain a thousand orbs, Her ruby lips her perled teeth in number, with that sweet tongsuch harmony affordes, As with applause makes all the world to ?wonder?. IX. [A prety ducke, there was that said] A prety ducke, there was that said, To whome shall I make mone I haue beene long a pretie maid And yet I lie alone. Alone I lie in deepe dispaire, Which kils my louely heart, For none wil my sweete ioyes repaire, Or play a louers part. A tickling part that maidens loue, But I can neuer get, Yet long haue sought, and stil do craue, At rest my hart to set. X. [Of all the birds that I doe know] [1] Of all the birds that I doe know Philip my sparrow hath no peer For sit she high or sit shee lowe, Be she far off or bee she neere There is no birde so fayre so fine Nor yet so fresh as this of mine, For when she once hath felt a fitte, Philip will crie still yet yet yet yet. 2 Come in a morning merily, When Philip hath beene latelie fed, Or in an Euening soberlie, VVhen Philip list to go to bed, It is a heauen to heare my Phippe, How she can chirpe with merry iippe, For when 3 She neuer wanders far abroad, But is at home when I do call, If I commaund she laies on loade, VVith lips, with teeth, with tong and all, She chaunts, she cherpes, she makes such cheare, That I beleeue she hath no peere. 4 And yet besides all this good sport, My Philip can both sing and daunce, with new found toyes of sundrie sort, My Philip can both pricke and praunce. And if you say but fend cut phippe, Lord how the peate wil turne and skippe, For when 4 And to tel truth he were to blame, Hauing so fine a bird as she, To make him all this goodly game, VVithout suspect or ielousie, He were a churle, and knew no good, Would XI. [The Queene of Paphos Ericine] [1] The Queene of Paphos Ericine In hart did rose checkte Adone loue He mortal was he but she deuine, And oft with kisses did him moue With great giftes stil she did him woo, But he would neuer yeeld thereto 2 Then since the Queene of loue by loue, To loue was once a subiect made, And could thereof no pleasure proue, By day by night, by light or shade, VVhy being mortall should I grieue, Since she her selfe could not relieue. 3 She was a Goddesse heauenly, And loude a faire facde earthly boy, Who did contemne her deity, And would not grant her hope of ioy. For loue doth gouerne by a fate, That heare plants will, and their leaues hate. 4 But I a haples mortall wight, To an immortall beautie sue, No maruaile then she loaths my sight, Since Adone Venus would not woo, Hence groning sighes, mirth be my friend Before my life, my loue shall end. XII. [I would thou wert not fayre or I were wise] [1] I would thou wert not fayre or I were wise, I wold thou hadst no face or I no eyes I would thou wert not wise or I not fond Or thou not free or I not so in bond. 2 But thou art fayre and I cannot be wise. Thy sun-like face hath blinded both mine eyes, Thou canst not but be wise, nor I but fond, Not thou but free, nor I but still in band. 3 Yet am I wise to thinke that thou art faire, Mine eyes their purenes in thy face repaire, Nor am I fond that do thy wisedome see, Nor yet in b?d because that thou art free. 4 Then in thy beauty onely make me wise, And in thy face, the grace, guide both mine eyes, And in thy wisedom onely see me fond, And in thy freedome keepe me still in bond, 5 So shalt thou still be faire, and I be wise, Thy face shines still vpon my clered eyes, Thy wisedome onely see how I am fond, Thy fredome onely keepe me still in bond. 6 So would I thou were faire, and I were wise, So would I thou hadst thy face, and I mine eyes, So would I thou wert wise, and I were fond, And thou wert free and I were still in bond. XIII. [Vnto a flie transformd fr? humain kind] [1] Vnto a flie transformd fr? humain kind Me thought I ranged on a sunshine day, When for to ease my sadde afflicted mind Vpon my mistres robe I gan to play At length I mounted vppe at her dainetie breast Fro? wh?ce I soght my solace and my rest. 2 Yet not content with these aspiring toyes Changing my seate into her curled heyre, By seeking to encrease my new found ioyes, I turnde my sweete applause to sudden feares, For chauncing on her eyes of flame and fire, I burnt my winges whereby I did aspire. 2 Thus falling to the ground in my decay, With mourneful bussings crauing her reliefe, Me thought she moude with ruth my heauy lay, And crusht me with her foot to end my griefe, And said lo where the silly wretch doth lie, Whose end was such because he flue so hie. XIIII [What thing is loue, I pray thee tel] What thing is loue, I pray thee tel It is a prickle it is a sting It is a pretty prety thing It is a fire it is a coale Whose flame creeps in at euery hole, And as my wits can best deuise, Loues darling lies in Ladies eyes. [XV.
