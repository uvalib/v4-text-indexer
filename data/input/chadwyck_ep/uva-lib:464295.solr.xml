      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Worshipfull, most worthy Graue Senators, Guardians, of Gresham Colledge in London. S?. Stephen Soames. Alderman S?. Iohn Garret. Alderman S?. Thomas Lowe. Alderman S?. William Crauen. Alderman M?. Cornelius Fish. Chamberlaine. S?. Tho: Bennet Alderman M?. Tho: Bennet Sheriffe. Alderman. S?. Baptist Hicks Of the Mercers Company. M?. William Quarles Of the Mercers Company. M?. Edward Barnes Of the Mercers Company. M?. Iohn Gardiner Of the Mercers Company. M?. William Ferrers Of the Mercers Company. And the 2. Wardens Of the Mercers Company. And to the Right Worshipfull Sir Iohn Swinerton and Sir Thomas Hayes Knights and Aldermen, most True and honourable affectors of Musicke. In Approbation of this Worke. In former Age, among Musicians rare, Regard was had of Measures then in vse And Characters; ordain'd by speciall care, Least after-C?mers should the same abuse, But for as much as those Composers Sage Occasion had not to apply each thing Vnto the divers Humours which this Age Hath studied out, and to the world doth bring: I well approue this Authors Diligence, Who by his Labour Characters hath found, To shew what bare to fore by negligence Hath beene omitted, and for certaine ground To make that plaine, that wanting was before In Measures, Times, Prolations well obseru'd. Wherein his Commendations is the more, His Songs, and Skill high Praise hath well deseru'd. Of this Ensuing Discourse. Markes that did limit Lands is former times None durst remain so much the common good Preuail'd with all men; 'twas the worst of crimes. The like in Musicke may be vnderstood, For That the treasure of the Soule is next To the rich Store-house of Diuinity: Both comfort Soules that are with care perplext and set the Spirit Both from passions free. The Markes that limit Musicke heere are taught, So fixt of ould, which none by right can change, Though Vse much alteration hath wrought, To Musickes Fathers that would now seeme strange. The best embrace, which herein you may finde, And th'Author praise for his good Worke, and Minde. Iohn Dowland Bachelar of Musicke, and Lutenist to the Kings Sacred Maiestie, in commendation of this Worke. Figurate Musicke doth in each Degree Require it Notes, of seuerall Quantity; By Perfect, or Imperfect Measure chang'd: And that of More, or Lesse, whose Markes were rang'd By Number, Circle, and Poynt: but various vse Of vnskild Composers did induce Confusion, which made muddy and obscure, What first Inuention fram'd most cleere, and pure. Those, (worthy Ravenscroft) are restrain'd by Thee To me fixt Forme: and that approu'd by Me. In the most iust praise of, Musicke, this praiseworthy Worke, and my deare, vertuous, and right expert friend, the most iudicious Author. The ten-fold Orbes of Heauen are said to moue By Musicke; for, they make Harmonious din: And all the Powres subordinate aboue Spend Time, nay, spend Ãternity therein. If Musicke then, moue all that All doth moue; That's not compriz'd in ALL that spights her State: If not in ALL, it's nought; which who doth loue is worse then nought, to loue what Heau'n doth hate: For, NOVGHT is nothing; sith it was not made By that great WORD, without which made was nought: Then, if that nought but NOVGHT doe her inuade, Like God, her goodnesse is surmounting THOVGHT! But no man is so ill that hath no good; So, no man in the Abstract can be nought: Then 'tis no man that hates sweete Musickes moode, But Some-thing worse then all that can be thought. A Beast? O no: A Monster? neither. Then Is it a Deuill? Nothing lesse: for, these Haue Beings with an Angell, or a Man; But that exists not, that sweete Notes displease. FORMES, Essence giue to Man, Beast, Fish, &amp; Fowle; Then Men WERE not, had they no Soule (their Forme) But Musickes haters haue no Forme, nor Soule; So, they (like Sinne) exist but to enorme, For, had they Soules produc'd in Harmony, Or rather Are it selfe (some Wise euouch) They would be ravisht with her Suauity, And turn'd CÅlestiall with her Heauenly Touch! But, let them goe as more than mortall Sinne 'Gainst Wisedomes Spirit, not to be forgiuen: While thou dost wooe the Soules, which thou dost winne With thy sweet Notes (deere Friend) to mind but Heau'n. Thy Nature, Manners, and thy Notes doe make A Three-fold-Cord, to drawe all hearts it gaines: Thy Musickes Cordes hold Eares and Eyes awake (Yet lullaby in pleasure) with their Straines. So, then this latter Musicke (though alone) 'Twixt Fame and Thee doth make an Vnison, Through which consent, though Deaths clouds thee o're run Thy glory still shall shine, and cloud the Sun. In Approbation of this ensuing Discourse, and the Author therof my deare friend, Maister Thomas Ravenscroft. Arts are much alt'red from their Pristine State, Humors and Fancies so prÃ¦dominate. Ould Artists though they were Plaine, yet were Sure, Their PrÃ¦cepts and their Principles were Pure: But now a dayes We scarce retaine the Grounds, W'are so Extrauagant beyond our Bounds. Among the Rest, Musicke (that noble Art) In this sad Elegie must beare a Part; Whose Purity was such in times of yore, (When Theory the Practise went before) That then She was had in as great Esteeme As now of Her the Vulgar basely Deeme. Errors in Figures, Characters, and Note Doe Now cause many Teach, and Learne by rote. This my deare Friend doth seeke beere to amend; Wherein he trauaild farre, great paines did spend To right his Mother; he seekes to reduce Her to her auntient Grounds, and former Vse, To beate downe Common Practise, that doth range Among the Commons, and her PrÃ¦cepts change. Heere shall you finde of Measures diuers sorts, For Church, for Madrigalls, for sundry Sports; Heere shall you finde true Iudgement, store of reading, All for the Ould true Rules of Musicke pleading. Numbers of 3. among the Meane respected Are hence exil'd, and (worthily) reiected, As being crept in by Custome, and Vse Among the Vulgars, which the Wise refuse. Much might be said more of this little Booke: But let the Reader iudge that on't shall looke. This of the Author onely I will say, That in One poynt to no man he giues way; Composing of a Song vnto some Ditty He is so Iudicious and so Witty, That waighing first the Nature of each Word He findes fit Notes, that thereunto accord, Making both Sound and Sence well to agree; Witnesse his sundry Songs of Harmonie. What shall I say more? this Worke I approoue, And for his Skill, and Paines the Author loue. To him that reades. Concord and Discord still haue beene at ods Since the first howre the Heathens made them Gods. In euery Profession, Trade, or Art They draw their swords, and each Wit takes a part. There's neither Starre that moues, nor Hearbe that growes, But they Dispute vpon't with Words, or Blowes. 'Mongst which Musitians, hanging vp their Harpes Doe growe to fall Flat out, for Flats and Sharpes, And by their Discord make that Art vneuen, Whose Concord should expresse that Peace in Heauen: But heere is One, whose Doue-like Pen of Peace Striues to out-flie such Strife, and make it cease; And Discord brings with Concord to agree, That from their Strife he raises Harmonie. He that for Loue doth This, and not for Gaine, Must needes haue Praise, the proper due for Paine. To my deare Friend Maister Thomas Ravenscroft, vpon this Worke. I Prophesie (deare Friend) that thou which giu'st The Dead deserued Bayes, shalt while thou liu'st Neuer want Garlands of that Sacred Tree To Crowne thee in Ãternall memorie: Thou that hast made the dying Coales to Glowe Of ould Ed. Piers his name; which now shall growe ('Gainst all that enuious or malicious bee) In high Opinion 'mongst Posteritie; Nor shall they touch Worth without Reuerence, In whome once dwelt such perfect Excellence In Heaun'ly Musicke; I may call it so, If ould Pythagoras said truely, who Affirm'd that the SphÃ¦res CÃ¦lestiall Are in their Motion truly Musicall: And Man, in whome is found a humane Minde, (Then Whome, (Angells except) who e're could finde A Nobler Creature) some affirme consisteth Onely of Harmony, wherein existeth The Soule of Musicke; and yet (but for Thee) This Man had dy'd to all mens memorie; Whose Name (now cleans'd from rust) this Worke of thine (While there are Times or Men) I doe deuine Shall keepe Aliue; nor shall thy owne Name die, But by this Worke liue to Ãternitie: And from it men hereafter shall pull out Scourges, to lash the base Mechanicke Rout Of Mercenary Minstrels, who haue made (To their owne scorne) this Noble Art, a Trade. FINIS. Hunting, &amp; Hawking The following poems are scored for music in the source text. Where poems are not stanzaic, no attempt has been made to reconstruct the metrical lines.

Then rise, arise, for PhÅbus dies (in golde) the dawne of day, And Coveyes lye, in Feilds hard by, then Sing we care away.

Lver Faulkne Lver Faulkne: sluer, giue warning to the Feild, let flye let flye, make mounting Hearnes to yeilde. Dye fearfull Duckes, and climbe no more so high, The Nyas Hauke will kisse the Azure Skie. But when our Soare Haukes flye, &amp; stiffe windes blowe: then long to late we Faulkners, crye hey lo, hey lo, hey lo. hey lo, hey lo. But when &amp;c. Dauncing. 6 The Fayries Daunce. Dare you haunt our hallowed greene, none but Fayries heere are seene, downe and sleepe, wake and weepe: pinch himblacke, and pinch him blew, that seekes to steale a louer true. When you come to hear vs sing, or to tread our Fayrie ring, pinch him blacke &amp; pinch him blew, O thus our nayles shall handle you, thus our nayles shall handle you. 7 The Satyres Daunce. Round a round a keep your ring to the gloriousSunne, we sing Hoe! he that weares the flaming rayes, and the Imperiall Crowne of Bayes, Him with shoutes and songs we praise, that in his bountie would vouchsafe, to grace the humble, humble Syluans &amp; their shaggy race. 8 The Urchins Daunce. By the moone we sport &amp; play, with the night begins our day, as we friske the dew doth fall, trip it, little Vrchins all, lightly as the little bee, two by two, and three by three, and about, about goe we. 9 The Elues Daunce. Round about in a faire ring a Round about in a faire ring a, thus we daunce and thus we sing a, trip and trip and goe, too and fro and fro, too and fro, too and fro, ouer this greene a, all about, in and out, all about, in and out ouer this greene a. all about, &amp;c.

[10 Trudge away quickly &amp; fill the black Bole] Trudge away quickly &amp; fill the black Bole, deuoutly as long as wee bide, now welcome good fellowes, both strangers and all, let madnes &amp; mirth set sadnes aside. Of all reckonings I loue good cheere, with honest folkes in company: and when drinke comes my part for to beare, for still me thinks one tooth is drye. Loue is a pastime for a King, if one be seene in Phisnomie: But I loue well this pot to wring, for still me thinkes one tooth is drie. Masters this is all my desire, I would no drinke should passe vs by: Let vs now sing and mend the fier, for still me thinkes one tooth is drie. 11 Of Drinking.
