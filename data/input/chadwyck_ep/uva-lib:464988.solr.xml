A crown inwove with Amarant, and gold; Immortal Amarant! A flow'r which once In paradise fast by the tree of life Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence To Heav'n remov'd, where first it grew, there grows; And flow'rs aloft, shading the fount of life. Par. Lost, L. III, v. 352. CHRIST's PARABLE OF THE SOWER. I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. Psalm xlix, v. 4. All these things spake JESUS unto the multitude in parables. Without a parable spake he not unto them. Matth. c. xiii, v. 34. A wise man will hear, and increase learning, and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: To understand a proverb (a parable) and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. Prov. c. i, v. 5, 6. INTRODUCTION. Long e'er th'Ascréan Hesiod. bard had learnt to sing, Or Homer's fingers touch'd the speaking string; Long e'er the supplemental arts had found Th'embroid'ry of auxiliary sound; The heav'n-born Muse the paths of nature chose: Emblems and Fables her whole mind disclose, Victorious o'er the soul with energy of prose! True Poetry, like Ophir's gold, endures All trials, yet its purity secures; Invert, dis-joint it, change its very name, The essence of the thoughts remains the same. Something there is, which endless charms affords; And stamps the majesty of truth on words. The Son of Gideon Jotham. midst Cherizim's snow, Unskill'd in numbers taught the stream to flow, With conscious pride disdain'd the aids of art, And pour'd a full conviction on the heart: His cedar, fig-tree, and the bry'r convey The highest notions in the humblest way See the whole parable, Judg. C. ix, V. 7–21.. In Nathan's Fable strong and mild conspire, The suppliant's meekness and the poet's fire: Till waken'd nature bade the tears to flow, And David's muse assum'd the voice of woe On this occasion David composed the 50th psalm.. The Wise, All-knowing Saviour of mankind Mix'd ease with strength, and truth with emblem join'd: Omniscience, vested with full pow'r to chuse, O'erlooks the strong, nor does the weak refuse It is the uniform doctrine of Scripture, “That flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself.” Amos C. ii, V. 14.: Leaves pageantry of means to feebler man, And builds the noblest, on the plainest plan: Divine simplicity the work befriends, And humble causes reach sublimest ends. True Flame of verse, O SANCTIFYING FIRE Rom. C. xv, V. 16. 2 Thess. C. ii, V. 13. 1 Pet. C. i. V. 2.! Warm not my genius, but my heart inspire! On my cleans'd lips permit the coals to dwell Which from thy altar on Isaiah fell Isaiah C. vi, V. 6.! Cancel the world's applause; and give thy grace To me, the meanest of the tuneful race. Teach me the words of JESUS to impart With energy of pow'r, but free from art. THY emanations light and heat dispense; To sucklings speech, to children eloquence!— Like Habakkuk Hab. C. ii, V. 2., I copy, not indite; Tim'rous like him, I tremble whilst I write! But Jeremiah with new boldness sung, When inspiration rush'd upon his tongue Jer. C. i, V. 6, &amp;c. 8, 9.. The pow'rs of sacred poesy were giv'n By Him, that bears the signature of Heav'n John C. vi. Ver. 27.. PARABLE. When vernal show'rs and sunshine had unbound The frozen bosom of the torpid ground, When breezes from the western world repair To wake the flow'rs and vivify the air, Th'industrious peasant left his early bed, And o'er the fields his seeds for harvest spread. With equal hand, and at a distance due, (Impartially to ev'ry furrow true) The life-supporting grain he justly threw “Bless God, who hath given thee the two Denarii, namely, the Law and the Gospel, in recompense for thy submission and labour.” Chrysost. Hom. in Luc. C. 10.. As was the culture, such was the return; Of weeds a forest, or a grove of corn They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: They that regard not the law, are a dishonourable seed: they that transgress the commandments, are a deceivable seed. Ecclus. C. x, V. 19.. But, where he dealt the gift on grateful soils, Harvests of industry o'er-paid his toils. Some seeds by chance on brashy Brasby lands, in an husbandry-sense, signify lands that are dry, shallow, gravelly, and pebbly. Such sort of grounds the old Romans called glareous: —Jejuna quidem clivosi glarea ruris. Virg. Georg. II. grounds he threw, And some the winds to flinty head-lands blew: Sudden they mounted, pre-mature of birth, But pin'd and sicken'd, unsupply'd with earth: Whilst burning suns their vital juice exhal'd, And, as the roots decay'd, the foliage fail'd. Some seeds he ventur'd on ungrateful lands, Tough churlish clays, and loose unthrifty sands; The step-dame soil refus'd a nurse's care: The plants were sickly, juiceless, pale, and bare. On trodden paths a casual portion fell: Condemn'd in scanty penury to dwell, And half-deny'd the matrix of a cell; While other seeds, less fortunate than they, Slept—starv'd and naked on the hard high-way, From frosts defenceless, and to birds a prey. Here daws with riotous excesses feed, And choughs, the cormorants of grain, succeed; Next wily pigeons take their silent stand, And sparrows last, the gleaners of the land. Another portion mock'd the seedsman's toil, Dispens'd upon a rich, but weedy soil: Fat unctuous juices gorg'd the rank-fed root; And plethories of sap produc'd no fruit. Hence, where the life-supplying grain was spread, The rav'nous dock uprears its miscreant-head; Insatiate thistles, tyrants of the plains; And lurid hemlock, ting'd with pois'nous stains. What these might spare, th'incroaching thorns demand; Exhaust earth's virtue, and perplex the land See Hosea C. x, V. 4 and 8.. At last, of precious grain a chosen share Was sown on pre-dilected land with care: [A cultur'd spot, accustom'd to receive All previous aids that industry can give;] The well-turn'd soil with auburn brightness shone, Mellow'd with nitrous air and genial sun: An harmony of mold, by nature mixt! Not light as air, nor as a cement fix'd: Just firm enough t'embrace the thriving root, Yet give free expanse to the fibrous shoot; Dilating, when disturb'd by lab'ring hands, And smelling sweet, when show'rs refresh the lands. Scarce could the reapers' arms the sheaves contain, And the full garners swell'd with golden grain; [Unlike the harvests of degen'rate days,] One omer sown, one hundred-fold repays: Rich product, to a bountiful excess;— Nor ought we more to ask, nor more possess! The harvest overcomes the reapers' toil: So feeble is the hind, so strong the soil Imbecillior colonus quàm ager. Columella.. Man's Saviour thus his Parable express'd: He that hath ears to hear, may feel the rest. INTERPRETATION. The gift of Knowing is to all men giv'n “To sin against knowledge is a greater offence than an ignorant trespass; in proportion as a fault, which is capable of no excuse, is more heinous than a fault which admits of a tolerable defence.” J. Mart. Resp. ad Orthod. “Ignorance will not excuse sin, when it is a sin in itself.” Anon. Vet.; All know, but few perform, the will of Heav'n; They hear the sound, but miss the sense convey'd, And lose the substance, whilst they view the shade. When specious doctrines hover round a mind Which is not vitally with Heav'n conjoin'd, The visionary objects float and pass Transient as figures, gliding o'er a glass: Each but a momentary visit makes, And each supplies the place, the last forsakes.— Satan for ever fond to be employ'd, [And changing minds ev'n ask to be destroy'd He that is idle tempts Satan to set him to work.” Chrysost. Hom. Pious Jeremy Taylor once said to a Lady, “Madam, if you do not employ your children, the Devil will.” The Son of Sirach gives also the following advice: “Send thy Son to labour, that he be not idle; for idleness teacheth much evil.” C. xxxiii, V. 27.,] Marks well th'infirm of faith; and soon supplies Phantoms of truth, and substances of lyes: Killing the dying, he a conquest gains; And, from a little, steals the poor remains. Reason, man's guardian, by neglect, or sleep Loses that castle, he was meant to keep. The seeds upon a flinty surface cast, Denote the worldly-wise, who think in haste: Who change, for changing's sake, from right to wrong, Constant to nothing, and in nothing long; To-day they hear the word of God with joy, To-morrow they the word of God destroy; Indiff'rent, to assert, or to deny: With zeal they flatter, and with zeal decry. Such is the Fool of Wit! who strives with pains To lose that paradise the peasant gains.— Whenever adverse fortune choaks the way, When danger threats, or clouds o'er-cast the day, This plant of casualty, unfix'd at root, Shakes with the blast, and casts his unripe fruit; But, when the storms of poverty arise, And persecution ev'ry virtue tries, Mindless of God, and trusting to himself “We are all careful about small matters, and negligent in the greatest; of which this is the reason, we know not where true felicity is.” St. Hieron., He strands Heav'n's freightage on a dang'rous shelf. Averse to learn, and more averse to bear, He sinks, the abject victim of despair! The men of pow'r and pomp resemble seeds Sown on rich earth, but choak'd with thorns and weeds. Religion strikes them, but they shun the thought; Behold the profit, and yet profit nought. Heav'n's high rewards they silently contemn, And think the present world suffices them. Mean-while ambition leads the soul astray, Far from its natal walk, th'ethereal way; Int'rest assassins friendship ev'ry hour, Truth warps to custom, conscience bends to pow'r, Till all the cultivating hand receives Is empty blossom, and death-blasted leaves. Idiots in judgment; baffled o'er and o'er; Still the same bait, still circumvented more; Self-victims of the cunning they adore! Wise without wisdom, busy to no end; Man still their foe, and Heav'n itself no friend! The chosen seed, on cultur'd ground, are they Who humbly tread the evangelic way. The road to heav'n is uniform and plain: All other paths are serpentine and vain. The true disciple takes the word reveal'd, Nor rushes on the sanctuary conceal'd, Whilst empty reas'ners emptiest arts employ; Nothing they build, and all things they destroy! The Provident of Heav'n unlocks his store, To cloathe the naked, and to feed the poor: To each man gen'rous, and to each man just, Conscious of a depositary trust. Patient of censure, yet condemning none: Placid to all, accountable to One. Ev'n in prosperity he fears no loss, Expects a change, and starts not at the Cross. All injuries by patience he surmounts; All suff'rings God's own med'cines he accounts The Preacher writes beautifully upon this subject. Ecclus. C. ii. “My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for trial. Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in in time of trouble,” i.e. be not impatient to get over thy trouble. “Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end. Whatsoever is brought upon thee take chearfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate. For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity. —Look at the generations of old, and see, did ever any trust in the Lord and was confounded? Or did any abide in his fear and was forsaken? Or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him? For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy; He forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.—Wo be to the sinner that goeth two ways,” i.e. that hath recourse to man as well as God. “Wo unto him that is faint-hearted; for he believeth not, therefore shall he not be defended. Wo unto you that have lost patience: What will ye do when the Lord shall visit you?—They that fear the Lord will say, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: For as his majesty is, so is his mercy.” In like manner St. Chrysostom informs us, “That, in proportion as God adds to our tribulation, He adds likewise to our retribution.”: Studious of good, and penitent for ill, Still short of grace, yet persevering still; As just and true as erring nature can, [For imperfection sets its stamp on man.] Heav'n marks the saint, her mansions to adorn, And, having purg'd the chaff, accepts the corn. THE ASCETIC, OR, THOMAS A KEMPIS: A VISION. IN OMNIBUS REQUIEM QUÆSIVI, ET NUSQUAM INVENI, NISI IN ANGULIS, ET LIBELLIS. Symbol. Kempisian. At nunc, discussa rerum caligine, verum Aspicis; illo alii rursus jactantur in alto. At tua securos portus, blandamque quietem Intravit, non quassa ratis. Stat. Sylv. L. II. And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. Mark C. i, V. 35.

Rhyne Thro' meads his Alpine waters roll'd, Where pansies mixt with daisies shine, And asphodels instarr'd with gold; Two forests, skirting round the feet Of everlasting mountains, meet, Half-parted by an op'ning glade; Around Hercynian oaks are seen.— Larches The species of Larch-tree here meant is called Sempervirens: The other larches are deciduis foliis., and cypress ever-green, Unite their hospitable shade. II Impearl'd with dew, the rosy Morn Stood tip-toe Tip-toe. Shakespeare. on the mountain's brow; Gleams following gleams the heav'ns adorn, And gild the theatre below: Nature from needful slumber wakes, And from her misty eye-balls shakes The balmy dews of soft repose: The pious lark with grateful lays Ascends the skies, and chants the praise Which man to his Creator owes “Before we engage in worldly business, or any common amusements of life, let us be careful to consecrate the first-fruits of the day, and the very beginning of our holy thoughts unto the service of God.” St. Basil.. III When lo! a venerable Sire appears, With sprightly foot-steps hast'ning o'er the plain; His tresses bore the marks of fourscore years, Yet free from sickness he, and void of pain: His eyes with half their youthful clearness shone Thomas à Kempis had no manifest infirmities of old-age, and retained his eye-sight perfect to the last. All that I have ever been able to learn in Germany, upon good authority, concerning him, is as follows: He was born at Kempis, or Kempen, a small walled town in the dutchy of Cleves, and diocese of Cologn. His family-name was Hamerlein, which signifies in the German language a little Hammer. We find also that his parents were named John and Gertrude Hamerlein. He lived chiefly in the monastery of Mount St. Agnes; where his effigy, together with a prospect of the monastery, was engraven on a plate of copper that lies over his body. The said monastery is now called Bergh-Clooster, or, as we might say in English, Hill-Cloyster. Many strangers in their travels visit it. Kempis was certainly one of the best and greatest men since the primitive ages His Book of the Imitation of Christ has seen near forty Editions in the original Latin, and above sixty Translations have been made from it into modern languages. Our author died August the 8th, 1471, aged 92 years. In the engraving on copper above-mentioned, and lying over his grave, is represented a person respectfully presenting to him a label, on which is written a verse to this effect: “Oh! where is Peace? for Thou its paths hast tred.”— To which Kempis returns another strip of paper, inscribed as follows: “In poverty, retirement, and with God.” He was a canon regular of Augustins, and sub-prior of Mount St. Agnes' monastery. He composed his treatise On the Imitation of Christ in the sixty-first year of his age, as appears from a note of his own writing in the library of his convent.. Still on his cheeks health's tincture gently glow'd, His aged voice retain'd a manly tone, His peaceful blood in equal tenour flow'd; At length, beneath a beechen shade reclin'd, He thus pour'd forth to Heav'n the transports of his mind. I “Come unto me” [Messiah cries] “All that are laden and oppress'd:” “To Thee I come” [my heart replies] “O Patron of eternal rest!” “Who walks with me” [rejoins the Voice] “In purest day-light shall rejoice, “Incapable to err, or fall.” With thee I walk, my gracious God; Long I've thy painful foot-steps trod, Redeemer, Saviour, Friend of all Imitation of Christ, Lib. I, C. i.! II Heav'n in my youth bestow'd each good Of choicer sort: In fertile lands A decent patrimony stood, Sufficient for my just demands. My form was pleasing; health refin'd My blood; A deep-discerning mind Crown'd all the rest;—The fav'rite child Of un-affected eloquence, Plain nature, un-scholastic sense—; And once or twice the Muses smil'd! III Blest with each boon that simpler minds desire, Till Heav'n grows weary of their nauseous pray'rs, I made the nobler option to retire “Solitude is the best school wherein to learn the way to Heaven.” St. Jerom. “Worldly honours are a trying snare to men of an exalted station; of course their chief care must be, to put themselves out of the reach of envy by humility.” Nepotian. “The pleasures of this world are only the momentary comforts of the miserable, and not the rewards of the happy.” St. August., And gave the world to worldlings and their heirs; The warrior's laurels, and the statesman's fame, The vain man's hopes for titles and employ, The pomp of station, and the rich man's name, I left for fools to seek, and knaves t'enjoy Cætera solicitæ speciosa incommoda vitæ Permisi stultis quærere, habere malis. Couleius de Plant.; An early whisper did its truths impart, And all the God conceal'd irradiated my heart. I Happy the man who turns to Heav'n, When on the landscape's verge of green Old-age appears, to whom 'tis giv'n To creep in sight, but fly, unseen! Stealer of marches, subtile foe, Sinon of stratagem and woe! Thy fatal blows ah! who can ward? Around thee lurks a motley train Of wants, and fears, and chronic pain, The hungry Croats of thy guard. II [Thus on the flow'r-enamel'd lawn, Unconscious of the least surprize, In thoughtless gambols sports the fawn Whilst veil'd in grass the tygress lies. The silent trait'ress crouches low, Her very lungs surcease to blow: At length she darts on hunger's wings;— Sure of her distance and success, Where Newton could but only guess, She never misses, when she springs This Parenthesis was inserted by way of imitating the famous Parenthesis in Horace's Ode, which begins Qualem ministrum fulminis alitem, &amp;c..] III More truly wise the man, whose early youth “Even from the flower till the grape was ripe, hath my heart delighted in Wisdom.” Ecolus. C. li, V. 15. Is offer'd a free off'ring to the Lord, A self-addicted votary to truth, Servant thro' choice, disciple by accord! Heav'n always did th'unblemish'd turtle chuse, Where health conjoin'd with spirit most abounds: Heav'n seeks the young, nor does the old refuse, But youth acquits the debt, which age compounds! Aukward in time, and sour'd with self-disgrace, The spend-thrift pays his all, and takes the bankrupt's place. I Thus spoke the venerable Sage, Who ne'er imbib'd Mæonian lore, Who drew no aids from Maro's page, And yet to nobler flights could soar. Taught by the Solyméan maid; With native elegance array'd He gave his easy thoughts to flow; The charms which anxious art deny'd Truth and simplicity supply'd, Melodious in religious woe. II Poet in sentiment! He feels The flame; nor seeks from verse's aid! The veil which artful charms conceals, To real beauty proves a shade. When nature's out-lines dubious are, Verse decks them with a slight cymarr A thin covering of the gause, or sarcenet-kind. Dryd. Cymon &amp; Iphigen.; True charms by art in vain are drest. Not icy prose could damp his fire: Intense the flame and mounting high'r, Brightly victorious when opprest! III By this time morn in all its glory shone; The sun's chaste kiss absorb'd the virgin-dew: Th'impatient peasant wish'd his labour done, The cattle to th'umbrageous streams withdrew: Beneath a cool impenetrable shade, Quiet, He mus'd. So Jonas safely sate [When the swift gourd her palmy leaves display'd] To see the tow'rs of Ninus bow to fate Jonah C. iv, V. 6.. Th'Ascetic then drew forth a parchment-scroll, And thus pour'd out to Heav'n th'effusions of his soul. THE MEDITATION OF THOMAS A KEMPIS. 1. 'Tis Vanity to wish for length of days; The art of living well is wise men's praise. If death, not length of life, engag'd our view, Life would be happier, and death happier too This and the following passages marked with a note of reference are extracted almost verbatim from Kempis's Book of the Imitation of Christ. Lib. I, C. 1, 2. See also Lib. I, C. 19. 23.. Nature foreshows our death: 'Tis God's decree; The King, the insect dies; and so must We. What's natural, and common to us all, What's necessary;—none should evil call. Check thy fond love of life, and human pride; Shall man repine at death, when Christ has dy'd? 2. He that can calmly view the mask of death, Will never tremble at the face beneath: Probationer of Heav'n, be starts no more To see the last sands ebb, than those before “Death, when compared to life, seems to be a remedy and not a punishment.” St. Macar. On the same point another Primitive Christian hath observed, “That the Supreme Being made life short; since, as the troubles of it cannot be removed from us, we may the sooner be removed from them.” St. Bernard.. 3. In vain we argue, boast, elude, descant;— No man is honest that's afraid of want. No blood of confessors that bosom warms “Dost thou fear poverty? Christ calls the poor man blessed.— —Art thou afraid of labour? Pains are productive of a crown. —Art thou hungry? A true confidence in God fears no famine: —for the Supreme Governour of the world beholds thy warfare; and prepares for thee a crown of glory and everlasting rest.”— Hieron. in Epist., Which starts at hunger, as the worst of harms. L. II, Thom, à Kempis. 4. The man with christian perseverance fir'd Perseverance is an image of eternity.” St. Bernard., Check'd but not stop'd; retarded but not tir'd; Straiten'd by foes, yet sure of a retreat, In Heav'n's protection rests securely great “The greatest safety man can have is to fear nothing but God.” Senec. “Human fear depresses, the fear of God exhilarates.” Cassian.: Hears ev'ry sharp alarm without dismay; Midst dangers dauntless, and midst terrors gay; Indignant of obstruction glows his flame, And, struggling, mounts to Heav'n, from whence it came: Oppress'd it thrives; its own destroyers tires, And with unceasing fortitude aspires. Imitat. of Christ, L. III, C. 5. Ibid. C. 19, N?. 1. When man desponds, [of human hope bereft,] Patience and Christian heroism are left. Ibid. C. 35, N?. 2. Ibid. C. 18. N?. 2. Let Patience be thy first and last concern; The hardest task a Christian has to learn See also Caussin's Holy Court, Part I, L. 3, Sect. 32, Fol. 1650.! Life's pendulum in th'other world shall make Advances, on the side it now goes back. By force, a virtue of celestial kind Was never storm'd; by art 'tis undermin'd “True christian piety was never made a real captive; it may be killed, but cannot be conquered.” St. Jerom.. 5. All seek for knowledge. Knowledge is no more Than this; To know ourselves, and God adore. Wouldst thou with profit seek, and learn with gain?— Unknown thyself, in solitude remain. Imitat. of Christ, L. I, C. 20. L. II, C. 10. Virtue retires, but in retirement blooms, Full of good works, and dying in perfumes “The retired christian, in seeking after an happy life, actually enjoys one; and possesses that already which he only fancies he is pursuing.” St. Eucher.. In thy own heart the living waters rise “Drink waters out of thine own cisterns. Prov. C. v, V. 15. See also Rev. C. xxii, V. 1. “And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal.” See John C. vii, V. 38. Good conscience is the wisdom of the wise! Imitat. of Jesus Christ, L. I, C. 6. Man's only confidence, unmixt with pride, Is the firm trust that God is on his side! Imitat. of Jesus Christ, Lib. II, C. 10. “The only means of obtaining true security is to commit all our interests to God, who constantly knows and is ever willing to bestow good things on them that ask him as they ought.” Cassian. “Security is no-where but in the love and service of God. It is neither in Heaven, nor Paradise, much less in the present world. In Heaven the Angels fell from the divine presence: In Paradise Adam lost his abode of pleasure: In the world Judas fell from the school of our Saviour.” St. Bernard. Like Aaron's rod, the Faithful and the Just, Torn from their tree, shall blossom in the dust. 6. God, says the chief of Penitents St. August. The ten lines marked with inverted commas are a literal translation from him., is One Who gives Himself, his Spirit, and his Son. “Is hunger irksome?—Thou by Him art fed “With quails miraculous, and heav'nly bread. “Is thirst oppressive?—Lift thy eyes, and see “Cat'racts of water fall from rocks for thee. “Art thou in darkness?—Uncreated light “Is all thy own, and guides thy erring sight. “Is nakedness thy lot?—Yet ne'er repine;— “The vestments of Eternity are thine. “Art thou a widow?—God's thy consort true. “Art thou an orphan?—He's thy father too.” 7. The men of Science aim themselves to show “It is good to know much and live well: but, if we cannot attain both, it is better to desire piety than learning: for knowledge makes no man truly happy, nor doth happiness consist in intellectual acquisitions. The only valuable thing is a religious life.” Sti. Greg. Magn. Moral. And again: “That only is the best knowledge which makes us better.”, And know just what imports them not to know Imitat. of Christ.. [Once having miss'd the truth, they farther stray: As men ride fastest who have lost their way;] Whilst the poor peasant that with daily care Improves his lands and offers Heav'n his pray'r, With conscious boldness may produce his face Where proud philosophers shall want a place. Ibid. Philosophy in anxious doubts expires: Religion trims her lamp, as life retires. Imitat. of Jesus Christ, L. II, C. 10. True faith, like gold into the furnace cast, Maintains its sterling pureness to the last. Conscience will ev'ry pious act attest As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. Prov. xxvii, V. 19. “Thou canst avoid, sooner or later, whatever molesteth Thee, except Thy own conscience.” Augustin. in Psalm xxx.: A silent panegyrist, but the best! 8. All chastisements for private use are giv'n; The REVELATIONS PERSONAL of Heav'n: Imitat. of Jesus Christ, L. I, C. 13. “God causeth (afflictions) to come, either for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.” Job C. xxxvii, V. 13. “It is the work and providence of God's secret counsel, that the days of the Elect should be troubled in their pilgrimage. This present life is the way to our eternal abode: God therefore in his secret wisdom afflicts our travel with continual trouble, lest the delights of our journey might take away the desire of our journey's end.” Sti. Greg. Mag. “No servant of Christ is without affliction. If you expect to be free from persecution, you have not yet so much as begun to be a Christian.” St. August. But man in misery mistakes his road, Sighs for lost joys and never turns to God. Imitat. of Christ, L. I, C. 11. Heav'n more that meets her child with sorrows try'd; Her dove brings olive, e'er the waves subside. Imitat. of Christ, ibid. See also Gen C. viii, V. 11.. Man gives but once, and grudges when we sue; Heav'n makes old gifts the precedents for new. 9. Afflictions have their use of ev'ry kind; At once they humble, and exalt the mind: The ferment of the soul by just degrees Refines the true clear spirit from the lees. Imitat. of Christ, L. I, C. 13. Boast as we will, and argue as we can, None ever knew the virtues of a man, Except affliction sifts the flour from bran: Ibid. Lib. I, C. 16. Lib. III, C. 12. See also Amos C. ix. V. 3, and Luke C. xxii, V. 31. Say, is it much indignities to bear, When God for thee thy nature deign'd to wear? If slander vilifies the good man's name, It hurts not; but prevents a future shame. The censure and reproaches of mankind Are the true christian Mentors of the mind. No other way humility is gain'd; No other way vain-glory is restrain'd. Nor worse, nor better we, if praise or blame Lift or depress—The man is still the same. Imitat. of Christ, L. III, C. 5. The happy, if they're wise, must all things fear; Nor need th'unhappy, if they're good, despair. 10. Hard is the task 'gainst nature's strength to strive: Perfection is the lot of none alive; Or grant frail man could tread th'unerring road, How could we suffer for the sake of God? Ibid. Affliction's ordeal, sharp, but brightly shines; Sep'rates the gold “For Gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.” Ecclus. C. ii, V. 5., and ev'ry vice calcines. In adverse fortune, when the storm runs high, And sickness graves death's image on the eye, Nor wealth, nor rank, nor pow'r, assuage the grief— Ask God to send thee patience or relief. Imitat. of Christ, L. III, C. 5. The infant Moses 'scap'd his watry grave Exod. C. II, V. 5. Heav'n half-o'erwhelms the man it means to save! 11. Th'Ambitious and the Covetous desire “He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul, gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously. A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion, and the iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul.” Ecclus. C. xiv. More than their worth deserves, or wants require: Not merely for the profit things may yield, But ah, their neighbour's pittance maims their field: Thus, gain'd by force, or fraudulent design, The grapes of Naboth yield them blood for wine “Ahab's excuse to Naboth, when he said give me thy vineyard that I may make it a garden of herbs, represents in a lively manner the pretences that avaricious and ambitious men use, when they want to make new acquisitions. They lye to their consciences; asking a seeming trifle, and meaning to obtain something very valuable.” St. Ambrrose.” “Woe unto them that covet fields, and take them away by violence.” Micah C. ii, V. 2. “They enlarge their desire as hell, and are as death, and cannot be satisfied: Woe unto them that encrease that which is not theirs.” Hab. C. ii, V. 5, 6.. 12. Nothing but truth can claim a lasting date; Imitat. of Jesus Christ, L. I, C. 3. Time is truth's surest judge, and judges late: And, for thy guide, be HE alone believ'd, Who never can deceive, nor is deceiv'd —Neque decipitur, neque decipit unquam. Manil.! Thus safe thro' waves the sons of Isr'el trod; Their better magnet was the lamp of God: And thus Heav'n's star earth's humble shepherds led To their Messiah in his humbler bed. 13. Flatt'ry and fame at death the Vain forsake, And other knaves and fools their honours take “There is no work that shews more art and industry than the texture of a spider's web. The delicate threads are so nicely disposed, and so curiously interwoven one with another, that you would think it produced by the labour of a celestial Being; yet nothing in the event is more fragil and insubstantial. A breath of wind tears it to pieces, and carries it away. Just so are worldly acquisitions made by men in exalted stations, and reputedly wise and cunning.” Origen.. 14. Teize not thy mind; nor run a restless round In search of science better lost than found. Still teach thy soul a sober course to try, And shun the track of singularity! 15. Presumptuous flights and sceptical debates Foretell [Cassandra-like] the fall of states. So Greece and Rome soon moulder'd to decay, When Epicurus' system gain'd the day. But those who make prophaneness stand for wit, Desp'rate apply the pigeons to their feet: Bankrupts of sense, and impudently bad; Their judgement ruin'd, and their fancy mad! Like Daniel's Dan. C. viii, V. 10, 11. Goat The Prophet here means, by the Goat, the King of Greece, the region of vain philosophy. in th'insolence of youth, Stars they displace, and over-turn the truth. 16. He, who adopts religions, wrong or right, Is not a convert, but an hypocrite: Him, seeming what he is not, man esteems; God hates him, for he is not what he seems. The bull-rush thus a specious out-side wears, Smooth as the shining rind the poplar bears: But strip the cov'ring of its polish'd skin, And all is insubstantial sponge within. When not a whisper breathes upon the trees, Unmov'd it stands, but bends with ev'ry breeze. It boasts th'ablution of a silver flood, But feeds on mire, and roots itself in mud. 17. Self-love is foolish, criminal, and vain “He that loveth himself most, hath of all men the happiness of finding the fewest rivals.” Anon. Vet.; Therefore, O man, such partial views restrain: And often take this counsel for a rule, To please one's self is but to please one fool “He that pleaseth himself, pleaseth a fool.”. 18. The alms we give, we keep: The alms we save We lose: Possessing only what we gave “There is that scattereth and yet encreaseth; and there is that witholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.” Prov. C. xi, V. 24. “The riches which thou treasurest up, are lost; those which thou charitably bestowest, are truly thine.” St. August. But, if vain-glory prompts the tongue to boast, In vain we strive to give, the gift is lost. Wealth, un-bestow'd, is the Fool's Alchymy;— Misers have wealth, but taste it not;—and die. In ev'ry purse that th'avaricious bears, There's still a rent, which wily Satan tears Haggai C. i, V. 6.: A man may mend it, at returning light, But the Arch-Fiend un-darns the work at night. Useless, O Miser, are thy labours found; And all thy vintage leaks on thirsty ground —Ibi omnis Effusus labor.— Virg.. Chimeric nonsense! Riches un-employ'd In doing good, are riches un-enjoy'd. The slave who sets his soul on worthless pelf, Is a mere DIOCLESIAN to himself; A wretched martyr in a wretched cause; Alive, un-honour'd; dead, without applause! Boast not of homage to earth's monarchs giv'n;— A Paula's Paula was a Roman lady descended from the Gracchi and Scipios. Her husband was of the Julian race. After his decease, she gave most of her possessions to the poor, and retired from Rome to a solitude at Bethlehem. That incomparable virgin Eustochium was her daughter. Both their Histories are drawn at large by St. Jerom, and addressed to Euslochium. Paula has written some excellent verses on religious subjects. She built a temple at Emmäus in honour of our Blessed Saviour. Her tomb is at Bethlehem. The inscription for her and her daughter was written by St. Jerom.

No man at once two Edens can enjoy “It is not only difficult but impossible to enjoy Heaven here and hereafter; or, in other words, to live in pleasure and dissipation, and at the same time attain spiritual happiness. No man hath passed from one Paradise to another: No man hath been the mirror of felicity in both worlds, nor shone with equal glory in earth and in heaven.” Hieron.: Nor earth and Heav'n the self-same mind employ.

Those who revenge a deed that injures them, Copy the very sin, which they condemn “To return one injury for another is to revenge like man: Whereas to revenge like God is to love our enemies. It is a great happiness not to be able to hurt one's neighbour, nor to have the power and parts to do mischief. The ingenuity of [what we call] men of the world, consists in knowing how to injure others, and revenge ourselves when injured. Whereas, on the contrary, not to return evil for evil is the true honour and vital principle of the Gospel.” Leon..

The pow'rs of Zeuxis' pencil are the same, Enclos'd in gilded, or in sable frame. 29. The down that smoothes the great man's anxious bed, Was gather'd from a quiet poor man's shed: Content and peace are found in mean estate, And Jacob's dreams on Jacob's pillow wait “And Jacob took the stones of that place and put them for his pillows.” Gen. C. xxxviii, V. 2.. So Tekoa's Swain, by no vain glories led, Nurtur'd his herds with leaves, and humbly fed Amos C. vii, V. 14.. 30.

With pray'rs thy ev'ning close, thy morn begin; But Heav'n's true Sabbath is to rest from sin. 32. An Hermit once cry'd out in private pray'r, “Oh, if I knew that I should persevere!” An angel's voice reply'd, in placid tone, “What would'st thou do, if the great truth were known? “Do now “A Christian hath no to-morrow; that is to say, a Christian should put off no duty till to-morrow.” Tertull., what thou intendest then to do, “And everlasting safety shall ensue.” Imitat. of Christ, L.

When Heav'n excites thee to a better way, Catch the soft summons, and the call obey. Thus Mary left her solitude and tears, When Martha whisper'd, Lo thy Christ appears! Imitat. of Christ L.

The virtues of the world, which most men move, Are lay'rs from pride, or graftings on self-love “There is a sort of seeming Good, which, if a rational mind loves, it sinneth; inasmuch as it is an object beneath the consideration of such a mind.” St. August. de Ver. Relig. “Whatever is not loved on account of its own intrinsic worth, is not properly loved.” Idem in Soliloq. L. I, C. 13.: Whatever for itself is not esteem'd, Proves a false choice, and is not as it seem'd “In this life there is no virtue but in loving that which is truly amiable. To chuse this, is prudence; to be averted from it by no terrifying circumstances, is fortitude. To be influenced by no sort of temptation, is temperance; and to be affected by no ambitious views, is considering the thing with impartial justice as we ought to do.” Idem de Ver. Felicitat. L. II.. 35. The track to Heav'n is intricate and steep; Narrow to tread, and difficult to keep: On either hand sharp precipices lie, And our steps faulter with the swerving eye; That passage clear'd, a level road remains, Thro' quiet valleys and refreshing plains.

CONTENTMENT, INDUSTRY, AND ACQUIESCENCE under the Divine Will: An ODE: Written in the Alpine Parts of Carniola, 1749. The wilderness and solitary place shall be glad for them, [the children of the Lord:] and the desart shall rejoice and blossom like the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: They shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. Isaiah C. xxxv, V. 1, 2, I Why dwells my un-offended eye On yon' blank desart's trackless waste; All dreary earth, or chearless sky, Like ocean wild, and bleak, and vast? There Lysidor's enamour'd reed Ne'er taught the plains Eudosia's praise: There herds were rarely known to feed, Or birds to sing, or flocks to graze. Yet does my soul complacence find; All, all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Corrector of the mind “To be satisfied is the highest pitch of art man can arrive to.” St. Gregor. Hom.! II The high-arch'd church is lost in sky, The base Base for basis. See Zechar. C. v, V. 2. with thorns and bry'rs is bound; The yawning fragments nod from high, With close-encircling ivy crown'd: Heart-thrilling echo multiplies Voice after voice, creation new! Beasts, birds obscene, unite their cries: Graves ope, and spectres freeze the view. Yet nought dismays; and thence we find 'Tis all from Thee, Supremely gracious Deity, Composer of the mind! III Earth's womb, half dead to Ceres' skill, Can scarce the cake of off'ring give; Five acres' corn can hardly fill The peasant's wain, and bid him live. The starving beldame gleans in vain, In vain the hungry chough succeeds: They curse the unprolific plain, The scurf-grown moss, and tawdry weeds. Yet still sufficiency we find; All, all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Corrector of the mind! IV December's Boreas issues forth, In sullen gloom and horror drest, Charg'd with the nitre of the north, Abhorr'd by man, by bird, and beast. All nature's lovely tint embrown'd Sickens beneath the putrid blast: Destruction withers up the ground, Like parchment into embers cast ? inamabile frigus Adurit. Virg. Much to the same purpose is a passage in the Son of Sirach:— “When the cold north-wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into ice, He poureth the hoar-frost upon the earth. It abideth upon every gathering together of water, and cloatheth the water with a breastplate. It devoureth the mountain, and burneth the wilderness, and consumeth the grass as fire.” C. xliii, V. 19, 21.. Yet health, and strength, and ease we find: All, all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Composer of the mind! V Tremble, and yonder Alp behold A glaciére, or ice-mountain. Cuncta gelu, canáque æternùm grandine tecta, Atque ævi glaciem cohibent: riget ardua montis Æthenii facies, surgentique obvia Phœbo Duratas nescit flammis mollire pruinas. Sil. Ital., Where half-dead nature gasps below, Victim of ever-lasting cold, Entomb'd alive in endless snow. The northern side is horror all; Against the southern Phoebus plays; In vain th'innoxious glimm'rings fall, The frost out-lives, out-shines the rays. Yet consolation still I find; And all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Corrector of the mind! VI Bless me! how doubly sharp it blows, From Zemblan and Tartarian coasts! In sullen silence fall the snows, The only lustre nature boasts; The nitrous pow'r with ten-fold force Half petrifies earth's barren womb, High-arch'd cascades suspend their force, Men freeze alive, and in the tomb. Yet warmth and happiness we find; All, all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Composer of the mind! VII Then, in exchange, a month or more The Sun with fierce solsticial gleams Darting o'er vales his raging pow'r, Like ray-collecting mirrours, beams. Torrents and cataracts are dry, Men seek the scanty shades in vain: The solar darts like lightning fly, Transpierce the skull, and scorch the brain “The Sun parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof? A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the Sun burneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours and sending forth bright beams it dimmeth the eyes.” Ecclus. Ch. xliii, v 3, 4.. Yet still no restless heats we find; And all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Corrector of the mind!

IX Scipio sought virtue in his prime, And, having early gain'd the prize, Stole from th'ungrateful world in time, Contented to be low and wise! He serv'd the state with zeal and force, And then with dignity retir'd; Dismounting from th'unruly horse, To rule himself, as sense requir'd.

X When Dioclesian sought repose, Cloy'd and fatigu'd with nauseous pow'r, He left his empire to his foes, For fools t'admire, and rogues devour: Rich in his poverty, he bought Retirement's innocence and health, With his own hands the monarch wrought, And chang'd a throne for Ceres' wealth. Toil sooth'd his cares, his blood refin'd.— And all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Composer of the mind!

For valour, piety, and laws; Resign'd two empires to retreat, And from a throne to shades withdraws; In vain, [to soothe a monarch's pride] His yoke the willing Persian bore: In vain the Saracen comply'd, And fierce Northumbrians stain'd with gore. One Gallic farm his cares confin'd; And all from Thee, Supremely Gracious Deity, Composer of the mind!

IX, v. 280. INTRODUCTION. Dryden, forgive the Muse that apes thy voice, Weak to perform, but fortunate in choice. Who but thy self the mind and ear can please With strength and softness, energy and ease; Various of numbers, new in ev'ry strain, Diffus'd, yet terse, poetical, tho' plain: Diversify'd 'midst unison of chime; Freer than air, yet manacled with rhyme? Thou mak'st each quarry which thou seek'st thy prize, The reigning eagle of Parnassian skies; Now soaring 'midst the tracts of light and air, And now the monarch of the woods and lair Layer, lair, and lay, The surface of arable or grass-lands. Chaucer; Folkingham, 1610; Dryden. Laire also signifies the place where beasts sleep in the fields, and where they leave the mark of their bodies on young corn, grass, &amp;c..— Two kingdoms thy united realm compose, The land of poetry, and land of prose. Each orphan-muse thy absence inly mourns; Makes short excursions, and as quick returns: No more they triumph in their fancy'd bays, But crown'd with wood-bine dedicate their lays. Thy thoughts and music change with ev'ry line; No sameness of a prattling stream is thine, Which, with one unison of murmur, flows; Opiate of in-attention and repose! [So Huron-leeches, when their patient lies In fev'rish restlessness with un-clos'd eyes, Apply with gentle strokes their osier-rod, And tap by tap invite the sleepy God Voyages du Baron La Hontan..] No—'Tis thy pow'r, [thine only,] tho' in rhyme, To vary ev'ry pause, and ev'ry chime; Infinite déscant Milton.! sweetly wild and true, Still shifting, still improving, and still new!— In quest of classic-plants, and where they grow, We trace thee, like a lev'ret in the snow. Of all the pow'rs the human mind can boast, The pow'rs of poetry are latest lost: The falling of thy tresses at threescore, Gave room to make thy laurels show the more The verses of Robert Waring, [a friend of Dr. Donne's] on a poet in the beginning of the last century, may be applied to Dryden: “Younger with years, with studies fresher grown, “Still in the bud, still blooming, yet full-blown.”. This Prince of poets, who before us went, Had a vast income, and profusely spent: Some have his lands, but none his treasur'd store, Lands un-manur'd by us, and mortgag'd o'er and o'er! “About his wreaths the vulgar muses strive, “And with a touch their wither'd bays revive Dryden's Prologue to Troilus and Cressida.!” They kiss his tomb, and are enthusiasts made; So Statius slept, inspir'd by Virgil's shade ? tenues ignavo pollice chordas Pulso, Maroneique sedens in margine templi Sumo animum, &amp; magni tumulis accanto magistri. Sylv. Lib. IV.. To Spencer much, to Milton much is due; But in Great Dryden we preserve the Two. What Muse but his can nature's beauties hit, Or catch that airy fugitive, call'd wit? From limbs of this great Hercules are fram'd Whole groups of pigmies, who are verse-men nam'd: Each has a little soul he calls his own, And each enunciates with a human tone: Alike in shape; unlike in strength and size;— One lives for ages, one just breathes and dies. O Thou, too great to rival or to praise; Forgive, lamented shade, these duteous lays. Lee had thy fire, and Congreve had thy wit; And copyists, here and there, some likeness hit; But none possess'd thy graces, and thy ease; In Thee alone 'twas NATURAL to please! More still I think, and more I wish to say; But bus'ness calls the Muse another way. In those fair vales by nature form'd to please, Where Guadalquíver serpentines with ease, [The richest tract the Andalusians know, Fertile in herbage, grateful to the plow,] A lovely villa stood; [suppose it mine;] Rich without cost, and without labour fine; Indulgent nature all her beauties brought, And art withdrew, un-ask'd for, and un-sought. For lo, th'Iberians by tradition found That the whole district once was classic ground; Here Columella first improv'd the plains, And show'd Ascréan arts to simple swains: Taught by the Georgic-muse the lyre he strung, And sung, what dying Virgil left un-sung —Et quæ Virgilius nobis post se memoranda reliquit. Colum. de Hortis, L. X.. Fatigu'd with courts, and votary to truth, Hither I fled, philosopher, and youth: And, leaving Olivarez to sustain Th'encumb'ring fasces of ambitious Spain, [As once rash Phaeton usurp'd a day, Mis-led the seasons, and mistook his way,] I chose to wander in the silent wood, Or breathe my aspirations to the flood, Studying the humble science to be good. From the brute beasts humanity I learn'd, And in the pansy's life God's providence discern'd. 'Twas now the joyous season of the year: The sun had reach'd the Twins in bright career; Nature, awaken'd from six months repose, Sprung from her verdant couch;—and active rose Like health refresh'd with wine; she smil'd, array'd With all the charms of sun-shine, stream, and glade, New drest and blooming as a bridal maid. Yet all these charms could never lull to rest A peevish irksomeness which teiz'd my breast; The vernal torrent, murm'ring from afar; Whisper'd no peace to calm this nervous war; And Philomel, the Siren of the plain, Sung soporific unisons in vain. I sought my bed, in hopes relief to find; But restlessness was mistress of my mind. My wayward limbs were turn'd, and turn'd in vain,— Yet free from grief was I, and void of pain. In me, as yet, ambition had no part; Pride had not sowr'd, nor wealth debas'd my heart. I knew nor public cares, nor private strife;— And love, the blessing, or the curse of life, Had only hover'd round me like a dream, Play'd on the surface, not disturb'd the stream. Yet still I felt, what young men often feel; [Impossible to tell, or to conceal,] When nothing makes them sick but too much wealth, Or wild o'er-boiling of ungovern'd health; Whose grievance is satiety of ease, Freedom their pain, and plenty their disease. By night, by day, from pole to pole they run: Or from the setting seek the rising sun; No poor deserting soldier makes such haste, No doves pursu'd by falcons fly so fast; And when Automedon at length attains The place he sought for with such cost and pains, Swift to embrace, and eager to pursue, He finds he has no earthly thing to do; Then yawns for sleep, the opium of the mind, The last dull refuge indolence can find Currit agens mannos ad villam hic præcipitanter, Auxilium tectis quasi ferre ardentibus instans. Oscitat extemplò tetigit cum limina villæ, Aut abit in somnum gravis, atque oblivia quærit. Lucret. L. III, v 1076.. Most men, like David, wayward in extremes, Languish for Ramah's cisterns, and her streams: The bev'rage sought for comes; capricious, they Loathe their own choice, and wish the boon away See Sandys's Trav. P. 137, and 1 Chron. Ch. xi, v 17, &amp;c.. Such was my state. “O gentle Sleep,” I cry'd, “Why is thy gift to me alone deny'd? “Mildest of beings, friend to ev'ry clime, “Where lies my error, what has been my crime? “Beasts, birds, and cattle feel thy balmy rod; “The drowsy mountains wave, and seem to nod: “The torrents cease to chide, the seas to roar, “And the hush'd waves recline upon the shoar.” Perhaps the wretch, whose God is wealth and care, Rejects the precious object of my pray'r: Th'ambitious statesman strives not to partake Thy blessings, but desires to dream awake: “The lover rudely thrusts thee from his arms, “And like Ixion clasps imagin'd charms. “Thence come to me.—Let others ask for more; “I ask the slightest influence of thy pow'r: “Swiftest in flight of all terrestrial things, “Oh only touch my eye-lids with thy wings All the verses in this Paragraph marked with inverted commas are imitated from a famous passage in Statius, never yet translated into our language. The original perhaps is as fine a morsel of poetry as antiquity can boast of. Crimine quo merui juvenis placidissime divum Quóve errore miser, donis ut solus egerem Somne tuis? Tacet omne pecus, volucresque, feræque; Et simulant fessos curvata cacumina somnos. Nec trucibus fluviis idem sonus. Occidit horror Æquoris, &amp; terris maria acclinata quiescunt. At nunc heus aliquis longa sub nocte puellæ Brachia nexa tenens, ultro te Somne repellit. Inde veni. Nec te totas infundere pennas Luminibus compello meis, [hoc turba precatur Lætior;] extremo me tange cacumine virgæ, Sufficit; aut leviter suspenso poplite transi. Sylv. L. V.!” So spoke I restless; and, then springing light From my tir'd bed, walk'd forth in meer despite. What impulse mov'd my steps I dare not say; Perhaps some guardian-angel mark'd the way. By this time Phospher had his lamp withdrawn, And rising Phoebus glow'd on ev'ry lawn. The air was gentle, [for the month was May,] And ev'ry scene look'd innocent and gay. In pious matins birds with birds conspire,— Some lead the notes, and some assist the choir. The goat-herd, gravely pacing with his flocks, Leads them to heaths and bry'rs, and crags and rocks.

Wand'ring still on, at length my eyes survey'd A painted seat, beneath a larch-tree's shade. I sate, and try'd to dose, but slumber fled; I then essay'd a book, and thus I read The Spanish author introduces the following passages from Lucretius.: “Suppose, O man, great Nature's voice should call “To thee, or me, or any of us all; “What dost thou mean, ungrateful wretch! thou vain “Thou mortal thing, thus idly to complain? “If all the bounteous blessings I could give “Thou hadst enjoy'd; If thou hadst known to live, “[And pleasure not leak'd thro' thee like a sieve;] “Why dost thou not give thanks as at a plenteous feast, “Cramm'd to the throat with life, and rise and take thy rest? “But, if my blessings thou hast thrown away, “If indigested joys pass'd thro' and would not stay, “Why dost thou wish for more to squander still? “If life be grown a load, a real ill, “And I would all thy cares and labours end, “Lay down thy burthen, fool! and know thy friend. “To please thee, I have empty'd all my store, “I can invent and can supply no more: “But run the round again, the round I ran before. “Suppose thou art not broken yet with years, “Yet still the self-same scene of things appears, “And would be ever, could'st thou ever live; “For life is still but life, there's nothing new to give. “What can we plead against so just a bill? “We stand convicted, and our cause goes ill. “But if a wretch, a man oppress'd by fate, “Should beg of nature to prolong his date, “She speaks aloud to him, with more disdain; “Be still, thou martyr-fool, thou covetous of pain. “But if an old decrepid sot lament; “What thou! she cries, who hast out-liv'd content? “Dost thou complain, who hast enjoy'd my store?— “But this is still th'effect of wishing more! “Unsatisfy'd with all that nature brings, “Loathing the present, liking absent things. “From hence it comes, thy vain desires at strife “Within themselves, have tantaliz'd thy life; “And ghastly death appear'd before thy sight “E'er thou hast gorg'd thy soul and senses with delight. “Now leave those joys, unsuiting to thy age, “To a fresh comer, and resign the stage. “Mean-time, when thoughts of death disturb thy head, “Consider, Ancus, great and good, is dead: “Ancus, thy better far, was born to die; “And thou, dost thou bewail mortality Lucret. L. III, translated by Dryden.?” Charm'd with these lines of reason and good sense, [No matter who the author was, nor whence,] I stopp'd, and into contemplation fell; Amaz'd an impious Wit should think so well; Who often [to his own and reader's cost] To show the atheist, half the poet lost. [Knowing too much, makes many a muse unfit; 'Tis not the bloom, but plethory of wit.—] At length a drowsiness arrested thought, And sleep [as is her custom] came unsought. Now listen to the purport of my tale. Methought I wander'd in a Fairy vale: Replete with people of each sex and age; Good, bad, great, small, the foolish, and the sage: Whilst on the ground promiscuously were laid Stars, mitres, rags, the sceptre, and the spade. At length a haughty Dame approach'd my view, Whom by no single attribute I knew; For all that painters feign, and bards devize, Is meer mock-imag'ry, and artful lyes. Boldly she look'd, like one of high degree; Yet never seem'd to cast a glance on me; At which I inly joy'd; for, truth to say, I felt an unknown awe, and some dismay. She pass'd me: Her side-face was smooth and fair; [Much as fine women, turn'd of forty, are:] When, turning short, and un-perceiv'd by me, She grasp'd my throat, and spoke with stern authority: “Him, whom I seek, art thou! Thy race is run: “My journey's ended, and thy bus'ness done. “Surrender up to me thy captive-breath, “My pow'r is nature's pow'r, my name is DEATH!” Have you e'er seen th'affrighted peasant grasp [Searching for flow'rs or fruits] th'envenom'd asp? Or have you ever felt th'impetuous shock, When the swift vessel splits upon a rock? Or mark'd a face with horror over-spread, When the third apoplex invades the head? Then form some image of my ghastly fright; Fear stopp'd my voice, and terror dimm'd my sight: My heart flew from its place Job Ch. xxxvii, v 1. in consternation, And Nature felt a short annihilation: Then—with a plunge—I sobb'd;—and with faint eyes Look'd upwards, to the Ruler of the skies From Statius. Stabat anhela metu, solum Natura Tonantem Respiciens.— Achill. I, v 487.. At length—recov'ring—in a broken tone— Princess—I cry'd,—Thy pris'ner is undone.— Despair and misery succeed to fear:— Oh had I known thy presence was so near! Abrupt th'inexorable Pow'r reply'd, [Then turn'd her face, and show'd the hideous side:] Fool! 'tis too late to wish, too late to pray: Thou hadst the means, but not the will to pay; Each day of human life is warning-day. The present point of time is all thou hast, The future doubtful, and the former past! Yet, as I read contrition in thy eyes, And thy breast heaves with terror and surprize, [I, who as yet was never known to show False pity to premeditated woe] Will graciously explain great nature's laws, And hear thy sophisms in so plain a cause. There is a reason, [which to time I leave] Why I give thee alone this short reprieve The reason is, that what here happens is a vision, and not a reality.. Banish thy fears, urge all thy wit can find, Suppose me what I am, suppose thy self mankind! She spoke, and led me by a private way, Where a small winding path half-printed lay: Then, turning short, an avenue we 'spy'd, Long, smoothly pav'd, magnificently wide. Dark cypresses the skirting sides adorn'd, And gloomy eugh-trees, which for ever mourn'd: Whilst, on the margin of the beaten road, Its pallid bloom sick-smelling hen-bane show'd; Next emblematic rose-mary appear'd, And lurid hemlock its stain'd stalks up-rear'd, [God's signature to man in evil hour!—] Nor were the night-shades wanting, nor the pow'r Of thorn'd Stramonium, nor the sickly flow'r Of cloying mandrakes; the deceitful root Of the monk's fraudful cowl Napellus; monk's-hood, friar's cowl; the most dangerous sort of aconite., and Plinian fruit Amomum Plinii.. Hypericon St. John's Wort. See Gondibert, L. I, Canto 6. This plant is called by us the herb of war, not merely because its juice is of a bloody colour, but because it is one of the principal vulnerary herbs used in making the famous arquebusade-water.—And again, as its leaves are full of little punctures and holes, it is named by Latin writers Porosa, and Perfoliata: The French call it Mille-Pertuis, and the Italians, Perforata. was there, the herb of war, Pierc'd thro' with wounds, and seam'd with many a scar: Add pale nymphæa Water-Lilly. with her clay-cold breath; And poppies, which suborn the sleep of death. This avenue [mysterious to relate] Surpriz'd me much, and warn'd me of my fate. Its length at first approach enormous seem'd; Full half a thousand stadia About threescore and ten miles: Emblematical of the Psalmist's duration of human life. as I deem'd: But then the road was smooth and fair to see; [With such insensible declivity] That what men thought a tedious course to run, Was finish'd oft the hour it first begun. Sudden, arriving at a palace-gate, I saw a spectre in the portal wait: An ill-shap'd monster, hideous to be seen; She seem'd, methought, the mother of the queen Sin.. Opening their valves, self-mov'd on either side, The adamantine doors expanded wide: When Death commands they close, when Death commands divide. Then quick we enter'd a magnific hall, Where groups of trophies over-spread the wall. In sable scrawls I Nero's name perus'd, And Herod's, with a sanguine stain suffus'd; While Numa's name adorn'd a radiant place, And that of Titus deck'd a milk-white space.

The contract was written, signed and sealed in due form, when lo, at the expiration of one year the evil spirit entered Malicorn's chamber, preceded by thunder and lightning, and demanded him as his forfeit. The astrologer was exceedingly terrified, and, after making many remonstrances, insisted on seeing the original contract; but the cyphers in number 100 were written with evanescent ink, and the figure I only remained legible. The moral of this fiction is incomparable. See Act V, Sc. 5.. “Two other mistress-arts You make your own; “To Circe and Urganda arts unknown: “When men look on you, and your steps survey, “You seem to glide a slant another way: “But the first moment they withdraw their eye “Swift you take wing, and like a vulture fly, “Which snuffs the distant quarry in the wind, “And marks the carcass she is sure to find.— “The next deception is more wond'rous still; “O grand artificer of fraud and ill! “When the sick man up-lifts the sash t'inhale “Th'enlivening breezes of the western gale, “To snatch one glympse of ease from flow'ry fields, “And [fancying] taste the joy which nature yields; “Far as the landscape's verge admits his view, “He sees a phantom, and concludes it you. “A gleam of courage then relieves his breast, “Be calm my soul, he cries, and take thy rest Luke Ch. xii. v 13.: “When at that moment, dreadful to relate, “[For all but he that ought observe his fate,] “The wife, the son, the friend perceive thee stand “Behind his curtains with up-lifted hand, “Thee, real Thee! to drive the deadly dart, “And at one sudden stroke transpierce the heart!” Culprit, thou hast thy piteous story told, As trite as Priam's tale, and twice as old, Reply'd the Queen: Painters and bards, 'tis true, Have neither sung me right, nor justly drew: I am not the gaunt spectre they devize With chap-fall'n mouth, and with extinguish'd eyes.— Whether enlighten'd with an heav'nly ray, Or whether thou hast better guess'd than they, I say not; yet thus much I must confess, Thy knowledge is superior, or thy guess. I own the feign'd retreat, th'oblique advance, The flight I take unseen, th'illusive glance, The blandishments of artificial grace, The sound, the palsy'd limbs, and double face. All I contend for, [there the question lies,] Is this; Let men but look thro' wisdom's eyes, And death ne'er takes them by a false surprize. Did not thy MAKER, when he gave thee birth, Create thee out of perishable earth? Where hot, and cold, the rough, and lenient fight, The hard, and soft, the heavy, and the light: Whilst ev'ry atom fretted to decay The heterogeneous lump of jarring clay?— Was not just death entail'd on thee and all, [Such the decree of Heav'n] in Adam's Fall? The parent-plant receiv'd a taint at root, Hence the weak branches, hence the sickly fruit. Thus with spring's genial balm and sun-shine fed The annual flouret lifts its tender head, In summer blooming, and at winter dead; Nay, if by chance a lasting plant be found, Whose roots pierce deep th'inhospitable ground; Whose verdant leaves, [life's common autumn past] Bid fair t'out-live the bitter wintry blast, And green old-age predicts a vernal shoot;— I lend my hand to pluck both branch and root.— Man is no more perennial than a flow'r; Some may live years, some months, and some an hour. When first thou gav'st the promise of a man, When th'embryon-speck of entity began, Was not the plastic atom at a strife, 'Twixt death ambiguous and a twilight life, Struggling with dubious shade and dubious light Like the moon's orb; whilst nations in affright Hope for new day, but fear eternal night? When motionless the half-form'd Fœtus lay, And doubtful life just gleam'd a glimm'ring ray, When nature bade the vital tide to roul, I cloath'd with crust of flesh that gem the soul; My mortal dart th'immortal stream defil'd, And the sire's frailties flow'd into the child. The very milk his pious mother gave Turn'd poison, and but nurs'd him for the grave “Consider, O man, what thou wert before thy birth, what thou art from thy birth to thy death, and what thou shalt be after death. Thou wast made of an impure substance, and cloathed and nourished in thy mother's blood.” St. August.. In ev'ry atom that his frame compos'd I weak to strong, unsound to sound oppos'd. Cruel, and proud of a deputed reign, I ting'd the limpid stream with gloomy pain; Nor yet contented, in the current threw Discolour'd sickness of each dismal hue. Thus from the source which first life's waters gave, Till their last final home, the ocean-grave, Infection blends itself in ev'ry wave: Marasmus, atrophy, the gout, and stone; Fruits of our parents' folly and our own! To live in health and ease you idly feign; Man's sprightliest days are intermitting pain. Changing for worse, and never warn'd by ill, Still the same bait, the same deception still! Youth has new times for change, and may command; Age ventures all upon a losing hand. The liberty you boast of is a cheat: Licentiousness lurks under the deceit: Plenty of means you have, and pow'r to chuse; Yet still you take the bad, the good refuse. The freedom of the tempests you enjoy, Born to o'erturn, and breathing to destroy. These injure not themselves, the reas'ning elf Injures alike both others and himself. Sour'd in his liveliest hours, infirm when strong, Unsure at safest, and but short when long. Hast thou with anxious care and strictest thought Made that nice estimate of TIME you ought? TIME, like the precious di'mond, should be weigh'd; Caracts, not pounds, must in the scale be laid. Know'st thou the value of a year, a day, An hour, a moment, idly thrown away? Then had thy life been blessedly employ'd, And all thy minutes sensibly enjoy'd! What are they now, and whither are they flown? Th'immortal pain subsists, the mortal pleasure's gone! Can'st thou recall them?—Impotent and vain! Or have they promis'd to return again? Call [if thou can'st] the winged arrow back, Which lately cut thro' air its viewless track; Or bid the cataract ascend its source, Which pour'd from Alpine heights its furious course; Ah no—Time's vanish'd! and you only find A cold, un-satisfying scent behind! Foe to delays, œconomist of time, Thrice-happy Titus, virtuous in thy prime! In whom the noon-day—or the setting sun Ne'er saw a work of goodness left un-done.— Old-age compounds, or [more provoking yet] Sends a small gift, when Heav'n expects the debt. Bring not the leavings of thy faint desires To Him who gives the best, and best requires; Man mocks his Maker, and derides his law: Satan has the full ears, and God the straw. Behold the wretch, who long has health enjoy'd, With gold un-sated and with pow'r un-cloy'd; Salmoneus-like, to fancy'd greatness rais'd, With slaves surrounded, and by flatt'rers prais'd: See him against his nature vainly strive, The busiest, pertest, proudest thing alive! [As if beyond the patriarchal date Exceptive mercy had prolong'd his fate.] When lo, behind the variegated cloud, Enwrapt in mists, and muffled in a shrowd, The dissolution of old-age comes on, Gouts, palsies, asthmas, jaundice, and the stone: An hungry, merciless, insatiate band, Eager as Croats for Death's last command! Which still repeat their mercenary strain, Lead us, to add the living to the slain. Then mark the worldling, and explore him well: His grief, his shame, and self-conviction tell; Weak were my joys, he cries, and short their stay: Pride mark'd the race, and folly pick'd the way. Can I revoke my mis-directed pow'r? Where's my lost hope, and where the vanish'd hour? Curst be that greatness which blind fortune lent; Curst be that wealth which sprung not from content! Still, still my conscious memory prevails; And understanding paints where mem'ry fails! Allow me next with confidence to say, [As safely with the strictest truth I may;] Why dost thou, ideot, senselessly complain, [Fond of more life, and covetous of pain,] That I, a tyrant, seize thee by surprize?— Flames, as she spoke, shot flashing from her eyes, Dotard! I gave thee warning ev'ry hour; Announc'd my presence, and proclaim'd my pow'r. One only bus'ness in the world was thine, Born but to die! T'exact the payment mine. If, atheist-like, you blame the just decree, Attack thy Maker, but exculpate me! Mortality's coeval with thy breath; Life is a chain of links which lead to death. Sleep—wake—run—creep—alike to death you move; Death's in thy meat, thy wine, thy sleep, thy love. Know'st thou not me, my warnings, and alarms? Thou, who so oft hast slumber'd in my arms! For ever seeing, can'st thou nought descry? Dead ev'ry night, and yet untaught to die? How dar'st thou give thy impious murmurs vent, Thy self a breathing, speaking monument? No death is sudden to a wretch like thee, The emblem of his own mortality! Above, beneath, within thee, and without, All things fore-show the stroke, and clear the doubt. The very apoplex, thy swiftest foe, Forewarns his coming; and approaches slow; Sudden confusions interrupt thy brain; Swift thro' thy temples shoots the previous pain; Suspicion follows, and mis-giving fear.— Death always speaks, if man would strive to hear. Acquit me then of fraudulent surprize: Leave sophistry to wits; be truly wise; For, as the cedar falls, it ever lies Eccles. Ch. xi, v 3.! Start not at what we call our latest breath; The morning of man's real life is death —Steriles transmisimus annos; Hæc ævi mihi prima dies: hæc limina vitæ. Stat. Sylv. L. 4.. So spake the POW'R, Who never felt controul. Fear smote my heart, and conscience stung my soul; Remorse, vexation, shame, and anger strive.— I wak'd:—and [to my joy] I wak'd alive. Never was human transport more sincere;— And the best men may find instruction here. MORAL. Who puts off Death, to the last moments driv'n, Is near the Grave, but very far from Heav'n A saying of pious Jeremy Taylor.. He who repents, and gains the wish'd reprieve, Was fit to die, and is more fit to live. Chuse a good convoy in an hostile course; Right foresight never makes a danger worse. THE COURTIER AND PRINCE: A FABLE. Put not your trust in Princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. Psalm cxlvi, v.3. Now behold, thou trustest upon the staff of a bruised reed—on which if a man lean, it will go thro' his hand and pierce it: So is Pharaoh, King of Egypt, unto all that trust in him. 2 Kings Ch. xviii, v. 21.

See Dryden's Threnod. August., o'er the waves: Casually lucky, fortunately great, Ten times his planet overcame his fate. Riches flow'd in; and accidents were kind; Health join'd her opium to delude the mind “Prosperous health and uninterrupted ease are often the occasion of some fatal misfortune. Thus a long peace makes men unguarded, and sometimes unmindful, in matters of war: It being observed, that the most signal overthrow is usually given us, when an unexpected enemy surprizeth us in the deep sleep of peace and security.” St. Gregor. the Great.; Whilst pride was gratify'd in ev'ry view, And pow'r had scarce an object to pursue; Cramm'd to the throat with happiness and ease, Till nature's self could do no more to please.— Vain-glorious mortal, to profusion blest! And almost by prosperity distrest! Whilst poets, the worst pandars of the age, Hymn'd his no-virtues in each flatt'ring page: True parasitic plants Parasitical plants, according to the language of botanists, will not grow in the common matrix of the earth, but their seeds, being dispersed by winds, take root in the excrementitious parts of a decayed tree, or arise as an excrescence from the exsudations of some tree or plant. Thus the dodder (cuscuta) formerly called pella-mountain, grows usually on flax; and therefore the Italian peasant calls it podagra di linio., which only grow Upon their patron-trees, like miscelto: So pella-mountain on the flax appears, And thyme, th'epíth?my The Arabians and Italians [imitating the Greek word ?????????] call this adscititious plant efitimo and epithimio; but very few of our English botanists make mention of it. As far as I have hitherto seen, only one of our herbalists has touched upon it, namely, Peter Treveris, who flourished about the reign of Henry VII. He calls it epíth?my. For my own part, not caring to invent new words in poetry, I have thought proper to retain the word which he (Treveris) has used, as it is well-sounding, and not inelegant., (her bastard) rears; Just so th'agáric from the larix springs, And fav'rites fatten on perspiring kings.— More might be said; but this we leave untold, That better things their proper place may hold. Our mirror of good luck, whom Chance had claim'd As her own offspring, was Amariel nam'd. At his first horoscope the goddess smil'd, And wrapp'd in her own mantle her own child; Then, as a Wit upon th'occasion said, [Not less a Wit, we hope, for being dead,] “Gave him her blessing, put him in a way, “Set up the farce, and laugh'd at her own play.’ Fortune, the Mistress of the young and bold, Espous'd him early, but caress'd him old; Duteous and faithful as an Indian wife, She made appearance to be true for life: And kept her love alive, and like to last, Beyond the date her Pompey was disgrac'd. But nothing certain [as the Wise man Son of Sirach. found] Is to be deem'd on sublunary ground. Join'd to good fortune, 'twas our Courtier's lot To serve a Prince who ne'er his friends forgot: Humain, discreet, compassionate, and brave; Not milder when he lov'd, than when forgave. Gen'rous of promise, punctual in the deed; Grac'd with more candour than most monarchs need.

Of all the great and harmless things below, Only an ELEPHANT is truly so. [Thus writes a Wit Dr. Donne's Letters in Prose, 12°, Lond. 1591., well-known a cent'ry past; Forgotten now; yet still his fame shall last.] Kings have their follies; Statesmen have their arts; Wealth spoils the Great; Beauty ensnares our hearts; And Wits are doubly dup'd by having parts. Some have ten times the parts they ought to use; “A great Wit's greatest WORK is to REFUSE Sir John Birkenhead's Epistle to Cartwright, 1638.!” Never, O Bards, the warning voice despise;— To ADD is dang'rous, to RETRENCH is wise. Poets, instead of saying what they could, Must only say the very thing they should. This mighty ?????? reserv'd for Few, Virgil and Boileau, Pope and Dryden knew. [Thus by the way.] Now, Muse, resume thy course; There is no wand'rer like the poet's horse: Who quits the solid road, and well-beat lanes, [Sick of his track, and punish'd for his pains,] To mimic galloping on green-swarth plains. So, in the daily work she labours at, The swallow toils, and rises with a gnat.— It chanc'd, as thro' his groves our monarch stray'd, T'enjoy the coolness of a summer-shade, Wrapt up in virtuous schemes of means and ends, To reconcile his foes, or bless his friends, He spy'd a figure, which by shape he knew, In a lone grotto half-conceal'd from view: Thither the prudent wand'rer had retir'd, As modesty and well-bred sense requir'd: Studious of manners, fearful to intrude On precious hours of royal solitude. Amariel, cry'd the Prince, I know thee well, Invelop'd in the umbrage of a cell: I like thy modesty, with manners fraught;— But, as my spirits ask a pause from thought, Walk with thy Master, and with him inhale The cooling freshness of the western gale.

In vain I cherish, and in vain replace; Th'ungrateful branch flies back, and wounds my face.

True as a dial, when their patrons shine; But blank, if the said patrons pow'r resign. Like good Sir Martin Sir Martin Marr-all, in a Comedy of Dryden's writing., when he lost his man, They grieve—and get another as they can. Yet, [tho' small real comfort is enjoy'd Where man the ruler is, and men employ'd,] Of all my friends and servants, you alone Have pleas'd me best, and most reliev'd the throne. Whatever then my bounty can provide; Whatever by my friendship be supply'd; As far as faith can bind, or speech can say, Ask, and I meet thy wishes half the way. The servant bow'd, and gratitude express'd; Such gratitude as dwells in courtier's breast: Pleas'd to the height of transport he retir'd; His fears were calm'd, and his ambition fir'd. Unhappy man, in both his objects wrong; The weak he trusted, and forgot the strong! Six years were past, when lo, by slow degrees, A fever did his limbs and spirits seize: Advancing gently, no alarm it makes, [Like murd'ring Indians gliding thro' the brakes:] But, having mark'd her sure approaches well, She storms, and nothing can her force repell. Instant, a liquid fire enflames the blood, Whilst spasms impede the self-refining flood: Petechial spots th'approach of death proclaim, Redd'ning like comets with vindictive flame; Whilst wand'ring talk, and mopings wild, presage Moon-struck illusion, and conclude in rage. Inevitable death alarms the heart; Nature stands by, and bids her aim the dart. The Sick man, stupify'd with fear and woe, Had hardly words to speak, or tears to flow; At length in broken sounds was heard to cry, Grant me to see my Master, e'er I die. The Master came. Ah, Prince, Amariel said, Now keep thy promise, and extend thy aid; Unfurl my tangled thread of human breath, And call me back one year, before my death. The Prince [for he was wise, and good withall,] Stood like a statue mortiz'd to the wall: At length, recov'ring from amazement, broke An awful silence, and thus gravely spoke: Amariel, sure thy pangs disturb thy brain: The boon you ask is blasphemous and vain: Am I a God, to alter death's decree? That's the prerogative of Heav'n, not me! Then, cry'd Amariel, with an hasty tone, Gain me a week, three days, or gain me one. Impossible agen! the Prince reply'd; Sure thy disease to madness is ally'd: Ask me for riches—freely I resign A third or half, and bid thee make them thine. Whate'er the world can human greatness call, Pow'r, rank, grants, titles, I'll bestow them all. Then die in peace, or with contentment live, Nor ask a gift no mortal pow'r can give. With eyes that flash'd with eagerness and fire The sick man then propos'd a new desire: “As death's dread tyranny has no controul, “Can you ensure the safety of my soul?” Anxious and doubtful for my future state, I read the danger, but I read too late. The Prince stood mute; compassion and amaze Tore his divided heart ten thousand ways: And, having rightly weigh'd the sick man's pray'r, Thus he reply'd in sorrow and despair: “Salvation of the soul by grace is giv'n;— “Unalienable is the Grace of Heav'n. “I tremble at the rash request you make, “Which is not mine to grant, or your's to take.” Amariel then, with disappointment spent, Turn'd from his Prince in mournful discontent, And, lifting up to Heav'n his hands and eyes, Thus in a flood of tears obtests the skies: “Wretch that I am, unworthy of my breath; “Deceiv'd when living, and deceiv'd in death! “Why did I waste my strength, my cares, my fame “To serve a master—master but in name? “An ethnic idol, for delusion made; “Eyes without sight, protection without aid? “Unable to bestow the good we want, “And ready, what avails us not, to grant! “Deceitful, impotent, unuseful Pow'r; “Which can give di'monds, but not give an hour! “At Rimmon's shrine no longer will I bow, “But thus to th'All-pow'rfull King address my vow: “O Thou, the only Great, and Good, and Wise, “Ruler of earth, and monarch of the skies; “Thou, whom th'intents of virtuous actions please; “Whose laws are freedom, and whose service ease Idcirco servi sumus, ut liberi esse possimus.

Far as its pow'rs could go, thy genius went: Good sense still kept thee in thy own extent Amongst Mr. Pope's great intellectual abilities, good sense was his most distinguishing character: For he knew precisely, and as it were by a sort of intuition, what he had power to do, and what he could not do. He often used to say, that for ten years together he firmly resisted the importunity of friends and flatterers, when they solicited him to undertake a Translation of Virgil after Dryden. Nor did he ever mistake the extent of his talents, but in the following trivial instance; and that was, when he writ his Ode to Music on St. Cecilia's day, induced perhaps by a secret ambition of rivalling the Inimitable Dryden. In which case, if he hath not exceeded the original, [for there is always some advantage in writing first] he hath at least surpassed [and perhaps ever will surpass] those that come after him, and attempt to make the same experiment..

About the year 1675, a nobleman was riding at night upon a road which goes near the edge of the precipice here mentioned. Mistaking his way (and that for a few steps only) his horse stopped short, and refused to go on; upon which the rider, who in all probability was heated with liquor, (otherwise he ought to have known the precipice better, it being not far from his own castle) lost both his temper and prudence, and spurred the horse with great anger; upon which the poor beast took a desperate leap, intending, as was imagined, to have reached another angle of the precipice on the same side which the road lay. The horse fell directly into the torrent, two or three hundred feet beneath, and was hurried away with such rapidity that the body was never found. The nobleman was discovered next day in an opening of the rock, about half-way down, where a few bushes grew; and, as the saddle was found not far from him, it was supposed that the horse, by the violence of the effort he made, burst the saddle-girths. The rider lived many years after this wonderful escape, and, out of gratitude to God, erected a beautiful chapple on the edge of the precipice, dedicated (if I mistake not) to St. Anthony of Padua. I made a drawing of the chapple, precipice, torrent, and nobleman's castle; of which a copy was taken afterwards by the celebrated draftsman Visentini, at Venice, in 1750: It makes the vignette, or ornamental copper-plate prefixed to this Poem..

It is busy to no purpose, and occupied to to no end, whenever it is not guided by divine influence: It seeketh rest and findeth none: It agreeth not with itself: It alters resolutions, changeth judgement, frames new thoughts, and suppresses old ones; pulls down every thing, and re-buildeth nothing; in short, it never continueth in the same state.” St. Bernard.

From noise and riot he devoutly kept, Sigh'd with the sick, and with the mourner wept; Half his earn'd pittance to poor neighbours went: They had his alms, and he had his content. Still from his little he could something spare To feed the hungry, and to cloathe the bare. He gave, whilst aught he had, and knew no bounds; The poor man's drachma stood for rich men's pounds. He learnt with patience, and with meekness taught; His life was but the comment of his thought. Hence, ye vain-glorious Shaftesburys, allow That men had more religion then than now. Whether they nearer liv'd to the blest times When man's Redeemer bled for human crimes; Whether the Hermits of the Desart fraught With living practice, by example taught; Or whether, with transmissive virtues fir'd, [Which Chrysostoms all-eloquent inspir'd,] They caught the sacred flame—I spare to say. Religion's Sun still shot an ev'ning-ray. On the south aspect of a sloping hill, Whose skirts meand'ring Peneus washes still, Our pious lab'rer pass'd his youthful days In peace and charity, in pray'r and praise. No theatres of oaks around him rise, Whose roots earth's centre touch, whose heads the skies: No stately larch-tree there expands a shade O'er half a rood See the note to Page 173. of Larisséan glade: No lofty poplars catch the murm'ring breeze, Which loit'ring whispers on the cloud-capp'd trees; Such imag'ry of greatness ill became A nameless dwelling, and an unknown name! Instead of forest-monarchs, and their train, The un-ambitious rose bedeck'd the plain: Trifoliate cytisus restrain'd its boughs For humble sheep to crop, and goats to browze. On skirting heights thick stood the clust'ring vine, And here and there the sweet-leav'd eglantine; One lilac only, with a statelier grace, Presum'd to claim the oak's and cedar's place, And, looking round him with a monarch's care, Spread his exalted boughs to wave in air. This spot, for dwelling fit, Eulogius chose, And in a month a decent home-stall rose, Something, between a cottage and a cell.— Yet virtue here could sleep, and peace could dwell. From living stone, [but not of Parian rocks] He chipp'd his pavement, and he squar'd his blocks: And then, without the aid of neighbours' art, Perform'd the carpenter's and glazier's part.

Half-useless doom'd to live, “Pray'rs and advice are all I have to give: “But all, whate'er my means or strength deny, “The virtues of Eulogius can supply. “Each, in the compass of his pow'r, he serves; “Nor ever from his gen'rous purpose swerves: “Ev'n enemies to his protection run, “Sure of his light, as of the rising sun. “What pity is it that so great a soul, “An heart so bountiful, should feel controul? “Warm in it self, by icy fortune dampt, “And in the effort of exertion crampt; “Beneficent to all men, just, and true: “As nature bounteous, and impartial too. “Thus sometimes have I seen an angel's mind “In a weak body wretchedly confin'd: “A mind, O Constantine, which from thy throne “Can take no honours, and yet add her own! “Then hear me, gracious Heav'n, and grant my pray'r; “Make yonder man the fav'rite of thy care: “Nourish the plant with thy celestial dew, “Like manna let it fall, and still be new: “Expand the blossoms of his gen'rous mind, “Till the rich odour reaches half mankind. “Give him Bizantium's wealth, which useless shines, “Sicilian plenty, and the Indian mines; “Instead of Peneus, let Pactolus lave “His garden's precincts with a golden wave; “Then may his soul its free-born range enjoy, “Give deed to will, and ev'ry pow'r employ: “In him the Sick a second Luke shall find; “Orphans and widows, to his care consign'd, “Shall bless the father, and the husband kind: “Just steward of the bounty he receiv'd, “And dying poorer than the poor reliev'd!” So pray'd he, whilst an angel's voice from high Bade him surcease to importune the sky: Fate stopp'd his ears in an ill-omen'd day, And the winds bore the warning sounds away; Wild indistinction did their place supply; Half-heard, half-lost, th'imperfect accents die. Little fore-saw he that th'Almighty Pow'r, Who feeds the Faithful at his chosen hour, Consults not taste, but wholesomeness of food, Nor means to please their sense, but do them good. Great was the miracle, and fitter too, When draughts from Cheriths's brook Elijah drew 1 Kings Ch. xvii, v 4, &amp;c.: And wing'd purveyors his sharp hunger fed With frugal scraps of flesh, and maslin-bread Maslin-bread, i. e. miscellane, or miscellaneous bread, an antient English word, given to a plain sort of household bread. When people in a middling station used it, they generally mixed two gallons of oats and rye with six gallons of wheat. The poorer people mixed in equal quantities wheat, barley, oats, rye, buck-wheat, pulse, &amp;c. But such is the luxury of the present age (even amongst the Poor) that not only the thing but the very name is forgotten; and a preference given to a whiter, but more unwholesome sort of bread, if alom enters into the composition; which, indeed, cannot be concealed. One of the first cares of a prime-minister (who ought also to be considered as proveditor-general of a kingdom) is to see the people supplied with bread, of an wholesome nature, at as reasonable a price as possible. Hence the Great Gustavus used to say, “That it required more talents to feed a large army in the field, upon easy terms, in times of war; than to conduct the fighting part.”. On quails the humble prophet's pride might swell, And high-fed lux'ry prompt him to rebell. Nor dreamt our anchorete, that, if his friend Should reach, O virtuous Poverty! thy end, That conscience and religion soon might fly To some forsaken clime and distant sky. Ign'rant of happiness, and blind to ruin, How oft are our petitions our undoing! Jeptha, with grateful sense of vict'ry fir'd, Made a rash vow, and thought the vow inspir'd: In piety the First, his Daughter ran, To hail with duteous voice the conqu'ring Man: Well-meaning, but unconscious of her doom, She sought a blessing, and she found a tomb Judges Ch. xi, v 31.! The Pow'r Supreme, [my Author so declares,] Heard with concern the erring Hermit's pray'rs; Heard dis-approving; but at length enclin'd To give a living lesson to mankind; That men thence-forward should submissive live; And leave Omniscience the free pow'r to give.— For wealth or poverty, on man bestow'd, Alike are blessings from the hand of God! How often is the soul ensnar'd by health? How poor in virtue is the man of wealth? The Hermit's pray'r permitted, not approv'd;— Soon in an higher sphere Eulogius mov'd: Each sluice of affluent fortune open'd soon, And wealth flow'd in at morning, night, and noon. One day, in turning some uncultur'd ground, [In hopes a free-stone quarry might be found,] His mattock met resistance, and behold A casket burst, with di'monds fill'd and gold. He cramm'd his pockets with the precious store, And ev'ry night review'd it o'er and o'er; Till a gay conscious pride, unknown as yet, Touch'd a vain heart, and taught it to forget: And, what still more his stagg'ring virtue try'd, His mother, tut'ress of that virtue, dy'd. A neighb'ring matron, not unknown to fame, [Historians give her Teraminta's name,] The parent of the needy and distress'd, With large demesnes and well-sav'd treasure blest; [For like th'Egyptian Prince Gen. Ch. xli, v 35, &amp;c. she hoarded store To feed at periodic dearths the poor;] This matron, whiten'd with good works and age, Approach'd the sabbath of her pilgrimage; Her spirit to himself th'Almighty drew;— Breath'd on th'alembic, and exhal'd the dew. In souls prepar'd, the passage is a breath From time t'eternity, from life to death “The time in which we now live is borrowed from the space of our existence: What is past is dead and vanished; what remaineth is daily made less and less; insomuch that the whole time of our life is nothing but a passage to death.” St. August. de Civitat. Dei, X.. But first, to make the Poor her future care, She left the good Eulogius for her heir. Who but Eulogius now exults for joy? New thoughts, new hopes, new views his mind employ. Pride push'd forth buds at ev'ry branching shoot, And virtue shrunk almost beneath the root. High-rais'd on fortune's hill, new Alps he spies, O'ershoots the valley which beneath him lies, Forgets the depths between, and travels with his eyes. The Tempter saw the danger in a trice, [For the man slidder'd upon fortune's ice:] And, having found a corpse half-dead, half-warm, Reviv'd it, and assum'd a courtier's form: Swift to Thebaïs urg'd his airy flight; And measur'd half the globe in half a night. With flowing manners exquisitely feign'd, And accent soft, he soon admission gain'd: Survey'd each out-work well, and mark'd apart Each winding avenue that reach'd the heart; Displaying, like th'illusive Fiend of old, Thrones deckt with gems, and realms of living gold Matth. Ch. v, v 8.. Bad spirits oft intrude upon the Good; Adonis' grot near Christ's presepio stood See Sandys's Travels into the Holy Land, Folio, P. 138. Presepio is an Italian word, taken from the Latin, and signifies a stable or manger. It is now become a term of art, and denotes any picture, drawing, or print, where Christ is represented as born in a stable or lying in the manger.. Th'artificer of fraud, [tho' here he fail'd,] Strait chang'd approaches, and the ear assail'd; This only chink accessible he finds; For flatt'ry's oil pervades ev'n virtuous minds. Virtue, like towns well-fortify'd by art, Has [spite of fore-sight] one deficient part. With lenient artifice, and fluent tongue, [For on his lips the dews of Hybla hung,] Libanius-like A famous Greek rhetorician in the fourth century, whose Orations are still extant., he play'd the sophist's part, And by soft marches stole upon the heart: Maintain'd that station gave new birth to sense, And call'd forth manners, courage, eloquence: Then touch'd with spritely dashes here and there, [Correctly strong, yet seeming void of care,] The master-topic, which may most men move, The charms of beauty and the joys of love! Eulogius faulter'd at the first alarms, And soon the 'waken'd passions buzz'd to arms; Nature the clam'rous bell of discord rung, And vices from dark caverns swift up sprung. So, when hell's monarch did his summons make, The slumb'ring demons started from the lake. Eulogius saw with pride, or seem'd to see, [Not yet in act, but in the pow'r to be,] Great merit lurking dormant in his mind: He had been negligent—but Nature kind: Till by degrees the vain, deluded elf, Grew out of humour with his former self. He thought his cottage small, and built in haste; It had convenience, but it wanted taste. His mien was aukward; graces he had none; Provincial were his notions and his tone; His manners emblems of his own rough stone. Then, slavish copyist of his copying friend, He ap'd him without skill, and without end: Larissa's gutturals convuls'd his throat; He smooth'd his voice to the Bizántine note. With courtly suppleness un-furl'd his face; Or screw'd it to the bonne mine of grimace; With dignity he sneez'd, and cough'd with grace. The pious mason once, had time no more To mark the wants and mis'ry of the poor! Suspicious thoughts his pensive mind employ, A sullen gratitude, and clouded joy. In days of poverty his heart was light: He sung his hymns at morning, noon, and night. Want sharpens poesy, and grief adorns; The spink Spink, the old poetical name for finches of every sort. See Country Farm, by Surflet and Markham, folio, printed in 1616. chaunts sweetest in a hedge of thorns Sic Orig.. Tir'd of an house too little for his pride, Tir'd of himself, and country-friends beside, He sometimes thought to build a mansion, fit For state, and people it with men of wit; Knowing [by fame] small poets, small musicians, Small painters, and still smaller politicians; Nor was the fee of ten-score minæ wanting, To purchase taste in building and in planting. A critic too he was, and rul'd the stage; The fashionable judgement Critics in the reign of Charles II. called themselves judgements. Hence Dryden says, —“A brother-judgement spare, “He is, like you, a very wolf, or bear.” of his age: When Crito once a panegyric show'd, He beat him with a staff Staff, i. e. Stanza. See Shakespeare, Cowley, and Dryden's Rival Ladies, Act I, sc. 2. of his own ode. Ah what, he cry'd, are Pindar's flights to me? I love soft home-made sing song, duty-free. Write me the style that Lords and Ladies speak; Or give me Pastorals in Doric Greek: I read not for instruction, but for ease; The opium of the pen is sure to please: Where limpid streams are clear, and sun-shine bright; Where woos and coos, and loves and doves unite: Where simply-married epithets are seen, With gentle Hyphen keeping peace between. Whipt cream; unfortify'd with wine or sense! Froth'd by the slattern-muse, indifference; And deck'd [as after-ages more shall see] With poor hedge-flow'rs, y-clept simplicity! Pert, and yet dull; tawdry and mean withall; Fools for the future will it nature call. He learnt his whims, and high-flown notions too, Such as fine men adopt, and fine men rue: [Meer singularity the point in view.] Julian with him was statesman, bard, and wit; Julian, who ten times miss'd, and one time hit; Who reason'd blindly, and more blindly writ. Julian, who lov'd each sober mind to shock;— Who laugh'd at God, and offer'd to a cock. He learn'd no small regard for Arius too: And hinted What,—nor He, nor Arius knew. But most [as did his pregnant parts become] He lov'd th'old pageantry of Pagan Rome. Pompous Idolatry with him was fashion; Nay, he once dream'd of Transubstantiation.— Now, Muse, return, and tread thy course again; I only tell the story of a swain. Pirasmus [for that name the demon bore Who nurs'd our spark in fashionable lore] Lik'd well this way-ward vanity of mind, But thought a country-stage a niche confin'd; Too cold for lux'ry, nor to folly kind: Bizantium's hot-bed better serv'd his use, The soil less stubborn, and more rank the juice. My Lord, he cries, [with looks and tone compos'd, Whilst he the mischief of his soul disclos'd] Forgive me, if that title I afford To one, whom nature meant to be a lord; How ill mean neighbourhood your genius suits? To live like Adam midst an herd of brutes! Leave the meer country to meer country-swains, And dwell where life in all life's glory reigns. At six hours' distance from Bizantium's walls, [Where Bosphorus into the Euxine falls] In a gay district, call'd th'Elysian vale Sic Orig., A furnish'd villa stands, propos'd for sale: Thither, for summer-shade, the Great resort; Each nymph a goddess, and each house a court: Be master of the happier Lares there, And taste life's grandeur in a rural air. He spoke. Eulogius readily agreed, And sign'd with eager joy the purchase-deed. Div'd in the Theban vales an home-spun swain; And rose a tawdry fop in Asia's plain. Dame nature gave him comeliness and health, And Fortune [for a pass-port] gave him wealth. The beaus extoll'd him, the coquets approv'd; For a rich coxcomb is by instinct lov'd. Swift Atalanta [as the story's told Ovid. Met. L. x, v 666.] Felt her feet bird-lim'd to the earth with gold: The youth Hippomenes. had wealth, with no unpleasing face; That, and the golden apples, won the race: Had he been swifter than the swiftest wind, And a poor wit,—He still had sigh'd behind.— Here Satan vanish'd:—He had fresh commands— And knew his pupil was in able hands. And now, the treasure found, and matron's store, Sought other objects than the tatter'd Poor: Part to humiliated Apicius went, A part to gaming confessors was lent, And part, O virtuous Thaïs, paid thy rent. Poor folks have leisure-hours to fast and pray; Our rich man's bus'ness lay another way: No farther intercourse with Heav'n had he, But left good works to men of low degree: Warm as himself pronounc'd each ragged man, And bade distress to prosper as it can: Till, grown obdurate by meer dint of time, He deem'd all poor men rogues, and want a crime “Why dost thou doat on the image of a King stamped on coin; and despisest the image of God that shines in human nature?” St. August. Minutius Felix addresses himself very pathetically to great and opulent men devoid of charity and alms-giving: “Aman,” says he, “asks bread of you.—Whilst your horses champ upon bridles whose bits are gilt with gold, the people die with hunger: —whereas one of your diamonds might save the lives of an hundred families.”. By chance he ancient amities forgot, Or else expung'd them with one wilful blot: Nor knew he God nor man, nor faith nor friends, But for by-purposes and worldly ends. No single circumstance his mind dismay'd, But his low extract, and once-humble trade; These thoughts he strove to bury in expence, Rich meats, rich wines, and vain magnificence: Weak as the Roman Chief, who strove to hide His father's cot, [and once his father's pride,] By casing a low shed of rural mold With marble-walls, and roof adorn'd with gold Sic Orig.. Who but Eulogius now is prais'd and known, The very Ignis fatuus of the Town? Our ready scholar in a single year Could lie, forget, swear, flatter, and forswear “Those who are accustomed to swear often may sometimes by chance happen to forswear; as he that indulges his tongue in talking frequently speaks that which he blushes for in silence.” St. Chrysost. Again, St. Jerom adds, “Let thy tongue be a stranger to lying and swearing; on the contrary, let the love of truth be so strongly in thee, that thou countest whatever thou sayest to be sealed with an oath.”. Rough to the tim'rous, timid with the brave; 'Midst wits a witling, and with knaves a knave. Fame, not contented with her broad high-way, Delights, for change, thro' private paths to stray; And, wand'ring to the Hermit's distant cell, Vouchsaf'd Eulogius' history to tell. At night a dream confirm'd the Hermit more; He started, scream'd, and sweat from ev'ry pore. He dream'd that on his throne th'Almighty sate In th'awful valley of Jehoshaphat Joel, Ch. iii, v 12., Where, underneath a spreading cedar's shade, He 'spy'd his friend on beds of roses laid; Round him a croud of threat'ning furies stands, With instruments of vengeance in their hands. The Judge supreme soon cast a stedfast eye, [Stern, yet attemper'd with benignity,] On the rash Hermit; who with impious pray'r Had been the sponsor of another's care. “Wretch, thou art lost in part, and in the whole! “Is this the mortgage for thy brother's soul?” An apoplex of dread Eusebius shook: Despairing Judas glar'd in all his look. Trembling he fell before th'Almighty-throne; Importunate as Abraham Gen. Ch. xviii, v 23–33. t'attone For others' crimes: O Pow'r Supreme, said he, Grant me, once more, th'ungrateful wretch to see: Suspend thy doom till then: On Christian ground No graceless monster, like my friend, is found. He spoke, and wak'd aghast: He tore his hair, And rent his sack-cloath garments in despair; Walk'd to Constantinople, and enquir'd Of all he met; at length the house desir'd By chance he found, but no admission gain'd; A Thracian slave the porter's place maintain'd, [Sworn foe to thread-bare suppliants,] and with pride His master's presence, nay, his name, deny'd. There walk'd Eusebius at the dawn of light, There walk'd at noon, and there he walk'd at night. In vain.—At length, by Providence's care, He found the door un-clos'd, nor servants near. He enter'd, and thro' sev'ral rooms of state Pass'd gently; in the last Eulogius sate. Old man, good-morrow, the gay courtier cry'd; God give you grace, my son, the sire reply'd; And then, in terms as moving and as strong, As clear; as ever fell from angel's tongue, Besought, reprov'd, exhorted, and condemn'd:— Eulogius knew him, and, tho' known, contemn'd. The Hermit then assum'd a bolder tone; His rage was kindled, and his patience gone. Without respect to titles or to place, I call thee [adds he] miscreant to thy face. My pray'rs drew down Heav'n's bounty on thy head, And in an evil hour my wishes sped. Ingratitude's black curse thy steps attend, Monster to God, and faithless to thy friend! With all the rage of an insulted man The Courtier call'd his slaves, who swiftly ran; “Androtion, Geta, seize this aged fool, “See him well-scourg'd, and send him back to school “Teach the Old Chronicle, in future times “To bear no mem'ry but of poor rogues' crimes.” The Hermit took the chastisement, and went Back to Thebaïs full of discontent; Saw his once-impious rashness more and more, And, victim to convinc'd contrition, bore With Christian thankfulness the marks he wore. And then on bended knees with tears and sighs He thus invok'd the Ruler of the skies: “My late request, All-gracious Pow'r, forgive!— “And—that yon miscreant may repent, and live, “Give him that poverty which suits him best, “And leave disgrace and grief to work the rest.” So pray'd the Hermit, and with reason pray'd.— Some plants the sun-shine ask, and some the shade. At night the nure-trees spread, but check their bloom At morn, and lose their verdure and perfume. The virtues of most men will only blow, Like coy auriculas, in Alpine snow This flower was first discovered under the snow, at the feet of some ice-mountains amongst the Alps.: Transplant them to the equinoctial line, Their vigour sickens, and their tints decline.— Heav'n to its pre-dilected children grants The middle space 'twixt opulence and wants. Mean-while Eulogius, un-abash'd and gay, Pursu'd his courtly track without dismay: Remorse was hood-wink'd, conscience charm'd away. Reason the felon of herself was made, And Nature's substance hid by Nature's shade! Our fine Man, now completed, quickly found Congenial friends in Asiatic ground. Th'advent'rous pilot in a single year Learn'd his state-cock-boat dext'rously to steer; Versatile, and sharp-piercing like a screw, Made good th'old passage, and still forc'd a new: For, just as int'rest whiffled on his mind, He Anatolians left, or Thracians join'd; Caught ev'ry breeze, and sail'd with ev'ry tyde; But still was mindful of the lee-ward side: Still mark'd the pinnacle of fortune's height, And bark'd—to be made turn-spit of the state. By other arts he learns the knack to thrive; The most obsequious parasite alive: Chamelion of the court, and country too; Pays Cesar's tax, but gives the mob their due; And makes it, in his conscience, the same thing To crown a Tribune, or behead a King: All things to all men;—and (himself to please) Assimulates “Protinus assimulat tetigit quoscunque colores.” Ovid. Met. XV, v 411. each colour which he sees. If patriots pay him, willow-wreaths he bears, And coats of filamotte Filamotte (Dryden) is that “clouded mixture of crimson, yellow, and umber-colours, which are seen in the beginning of winter on a falling leaf.” Filamotte, quasi feüeille morte. Thus Isabella-colour denotes a certain grave colour worn by the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Arch-duchess of Austria, &amp;c, 1623. For grideline, see the Vision of Death, page 99. complexion wears; If statesmen pay him better, a fresh hue Brightens his garb; more brilliant as more new; Court-turquoise, and indelible of blue. Thus weather-cocks by ev'ry wind are blown, And int'rest oils a motion, not their own. How strangely crouds misplace things, and mis-call; MADNESS in One is LIBERTY in All! On less important days, he pass'd his time In virtuoso-ship, and crambo-rhyme: In gaming, jobbing, fidling, painting, drinking, And ev'ry art of using time, but thinking. He gives the dinners of each up-start man, As costly, and luxurious, as he can; Then weds an heiress of suburbian mold, Ugly as apes, but well-endow'd with gold; There fortune gave him his full dose of strife, A scolding woman, and a jealous wife! T'encrease this load, some sycophant-report Destroy'd his int'rest and good grace at court. At this one stroke the man look'd dead in law: His flatt'rers scamper, and his friends withdraw “A friend cannot be known in prosperity, and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity.” Ecclus. Ch. xii..

And now [to shorten my disast'rous tale] Storms of affronts pour'd in as thick as hail. Each scheme for safety mischievously sped, And the drawn sword hung o'er him by a thread. Child he had none. His wife with sorrow dy'd; Few women can survive the loss of pride. Mean-while the Demon, who was absent far, [Engag'd in no less work than civil war] Perceiv'd th'approaching wreck; and, in a trice Appearing, gave both comfort and advice. “Great genius's,” he cry'd, “must ne'er despair; “The Wise and Brave usurp on Fortune's care! “The un-exhausted funds of human wit “Oft miss one object, and another hit: “The man of courts, who trusts to one poor hole, “Is a low foolish fool “A fool in his folly.” Prov. of Solom.

Ch. lv, v 20. Isaiah's advice is very noble: “Fear not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings: For the moth shall eat them up as a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my salvation shall be for ever.” Ch. li, v 7, 8. “I, even I, am HE that comforteth you. Why shouldest thou be afraid of a man that shall die, and forgettest the LORD thy Maker, who stretched forth the heavens?” Ibid. v 12, 13.! “Court-loyalty is a precarious thing: “When the king's trump, time-servers serve the king; “But, when he's out of luck, they shift their sail, “And popularity's the fav'rite gale: “Vain popularity! which fancy shrouds, “Like Juno's shade, in party-colour'd clouds. “Each man will go a mile to see you crown'd “With civic wreaths, till earth and skies resound; “And each man will go two to see you drown'd. “Whoever hopes in dang'rous times to rise, “Must learn to shoot swift Fortune as she flies: “Capricious Phantom! never at a stay; “Just seen, and lost; when nearest, far away! “But, to be brief; [and mark my judgement well:] “Your fortunes totter'd, when old Justin fell; “His successor Justinian., as you and all men know, “Is kind, when friend; and un-appeas'd, when foe, “Some sly court-vermin, wriggling in his ear, “Has whisper'd, what predicts your ruin near: “Then cast thy die of fortune all at once; “Learn to be any thing but dupe or dunce. “Fortune assists the brave.

He spoke, and vanish'd. Swift Eulogius fled, And to the Emulous of empire sped. Here, were it not too long, I might declare The motives and successes of the war, The prowess of the knights, their martial deeds, Their swords, their shields, their surcoats Surcoat, an upper garment of defence. Dryden. and their steeds; Till Belisarius at a single blow Suppress'd the faction and repell'd the foe. By a quick death the traytors he reliev'd; Condemn'd, if taken; famish'd, if repriev'd. Now see Eulogius [who had all betray'd Whate'er he knew] in loathsome dungeon laid: A pris'ner, first of war, and then of state: Rebel and traytor ask a double fate! But good Justinian, whose exalted mind [In spite of what Pirasmus urg'd] enclin'd To mercy, soon the forfeit-life forgave, And freed it from the shackles of a slave. Then spoke with mild, but in majestic strain, Repent, and haste thee to Larissa's plain, Or wander thro' the world, another Cain. Thy lands and goods shall be the poor man's lot, Or feed the orphans, you've so long forgot. Forsaken, helpless, re-cogniz'd by none, Proscrib'd Eulogius left th'unprosp'rous town: For succour at a thousand doors he knock'd; Each heart was harden'd, and each door was lock'd. A pilgrim's staff he bore, of humble thorn; Pervious to winds his coat, and sadly torn: Shoes he had none: a beggar gave a pair, Who saw feet poorer than his own, and bare. He drank the stream, on dew-berries he fed, And wildings harsh supply'd the place of bread; Thus home-ward urg'd his solitary way; [Four years had he been absent to a day.] Fame thro' Thebaïs his arrival spread, Half his old friends reproach'd him, and half fled: Of help and common countenance bereft, No creature own'd him, but a dog he left. Compunction touch'd his soul, and, wiser made By bitter suff'rings, he resum'd his trade: Thank'd Heav'n for want of pow'r and want of pelf, That he had lost the world, and found himself. Conscience and charity reviv'd their part, And true humility enrich'd the heart, While grace celestial with enliv'ning ray Beam'd forth, to gild the ev'ning of his day. His neighbours mark'd the change, and each man strove By slow degrees t'applaud him, and to love. So Peter, when his tim'rous guilt was o'er, Emerg'd, and stood twice firmer than before See Luke Ch. xxii, v 55–62. “Peter stood more firmly, after he had lamented his fall, than before he fell.” St. Ambrose.. Eusebius, who had long in silence mourn'd, Rejoic'd to hear the Prodigal return'd; And with the eagerness of feeble age Made haste t'express his joy, and griefs assuage. “My Son,” he cry'd, “once more contemplate me: “Behold th'unhappy wretch that ruin'd thee; “My ill-judg'd pray'rs [in luckless moments sped] “Brought down the curse of riches on thy head. “No language can express one single part “Of what I felt, and what still racks my heart. “Vainly I thought, that, to encrease thy store, “Was to encrease Heav'n's manna for the poor. “Man's virtue cannot go beyond its length; “God's gifts are still proportion'd to our strength. “The Scripture-widow Luke Ch. xxi, v 2. 2 Cor.

I quote the verses, because I never saw them quoted: —“Cujus “Non frontem vertére minæ; sed candida semper “Gaudia, &amp; in vultu curarum ignara voluptas. “Non tibi sepositas infelix strangulat arca “Divitias; avidéve animum dispendia torquent “Fœnoris expositi census; sed docta fruendi “Temperies,” &amp;c.; “Just rich enough, with œconomic care, “To save a pittance, and a pittance spare: “Just poor enough to feel the poor man's moan, “Or share those suff'rings which may prove their own!— “Great riches, with insinuating art, “Debase the man, and petrify the heart. “Let the false friend, like Satan, be withstood, “Who wishes us more wealth—to do more good! “To this great trial SOME are equal found; “MOST in th'unnavigable stream are drown'd Hugo, in his excellent treatise De Anima, makes the following remark upon greatness and ambition: “The human heart is a small thing, and yet desireth great matters. It is barely sufficient for a kite's dinner, and yet the whole world sufficeth it not.”.” He spoke: And, with a flood of tears opprest, Left his Eulogius to divine the rest. “Father,” he cry'd, (and with complacence smil'd) “Heav'n's tryals have at length reclaim'd its child. “Omniscience only can our wants fore-know, “And All-Beneficence will best bestow. “SOME FEW God's bounty on the Poor employ: “THERE ARE—whom to promote, is to destroy! “Rough, thorny, barren, is pale virtue's road; “And poisons are true cures when giv'n by God. “Spontaneous I resign, with full accord, “The empty nothings wealth and pow'r afford; “My Mind's my All, by Heav'n's free grace restor'd. “O Pow'r Supreme! unsearchable thy views! “Omniscient, or to give, or to refuse! “Grant me, as I begun, to end my days “In acts of humble charity and praise; “In thy own paths my journey let me run, “And, as in Heav'n, on Earth thy Will be done!” Thus he maintain'd Almighty Wisdom's cause.

That is, neither, by considering the works did they acknowledge the work-master” Wisd. of Sol. Ch. xiii, v 1.! His books, like friends were chosen, few and good; Constantly us'd and truly understood. The Sacred Scriptures were his chief delight He employed ten or twelve hours a day in study, without any interruption, [but that of casual sickness] for fifty years successively.

They were chiefly preached between the years 1550 and 1576. His son George [and here let me be understood to refer chiefly to his Paraphrase on Job] knew the true harmony of the English Heroic Couplet long before Denbam and Waller took up the pen; and preserved that harmony more uniformly. Variety perhaps was wanting; which Dryden afterwards supplied, but not till he came to the forty-fifth year of his age; namely, till the time he published Aurengzebe.;— [For in those days “were Giants in our lands!”] Thus, like the bee, he suck'd from ev'ry flow'r, And hour surpass'd the predecessor-hour. Latimer's father Bishop Hugh Latimer [whom I quote only by memory, not having the original at hand] says, in one of his Sermons preached at St. Paul's Cross, about the year ?, “that tho' his father possessed no more than 40 acres of free land, or thereabouts, yet he had always something to give to the poor, and now and then entertained his friends;—that he portioned out three daughters, at 5 l. a-piece, and bred up a son at the university; ‘otherwise, adds he, “I should not have had the honour of appearing in this pulpit before the King's majesty.” Note, The original Edition says 4 acres, which must be an error of the Press, instead of 40 acres. Old Latimer lived in good repute about the year 1470, in which year his son Hugh was born. was his type of yore; Little he had, but something for the poor: And oft on better days the board was spread With wholesome meat and hospitable bread.

The Judge listened to him calmly, and with some attention; and, tho' he had never seen him before, advanced him in a few months to a Prebendal Stall in the Cathedral church of Bristol..

Yet blam'd he none; [Himself in honour clear;] That were a crime had cost his virtue dear! Thus All he lov'd; and party he had none, Except with charity, and Heav'n alone.

B? sometimes would to thy cottage tend; An artful enemy, but seeming friend: Conscious of having plann'd thy worldly fate Bishop Ken used to say, that King William and Queen Mary would gladly have permitted the Non-juring Bishops and Clergy [who had just before signalized themselves in a steady opposition to Popery] to have enjoyed their preferments till death, upon their parole of honour given, that they would never disturb the government; which favour would have been thankfully accepted of, and complyed with, by the aforesaid Bishops, &amp;c.; but somebody here alluded to [at least as Macarius thought] traversed their Majesties gracious intentions. In proof of this, Bishop Ken performed the funeral service over Mr. Kettlewell in the year 1695, and prayed for King William and Queen Mary., He could not love thee, and he durst not hate. But then seraphic Ken was all thy own; And He Dr. George Hooper. N. B. It must here also be remembered, that Dr. Beveridge refused to succeed Bishop Ken in 1691, and then the offer was made to R.

Mark well the Man, and Heav'n thy labour bless;— In all be like him, but unhappiness! Thus He aspir'd on meditation's wings, And to the best of Consorts thus he sings: Rusticiana, loveliest of thy kind, Most in my eyes, and ever in my mind; Exil'd from all the joys the world can give, And—[for my greater grief!] allow'd to live: [By Him The Emperor Theodoric., I train'd to glory, basely left;] Of all things, but my innocence, bereft: Patrician, consul, statesman but in name; Of honour plunder'd, and proscrib'd in fame: [Betray'd by men my patronage had fed, And curst by lips to which I gave their bread;] To thee I breathe my elegies of woe; For thee, and chiefly thee, my sorrows flow: Joint-partner of my life, my heart's relief; Alike partaker of my joys or grief! All-bounteous God, how gracious was the care To mix thy antidote with my despair! Rusticiana lives to smoothe my death, And waft with sighs to Heav'n my parting breath. Hence hope and fortitude inspire my breast: Be her's the earthly part, and Thine the rest! Still I am happy, human and divine; Th'assistant angel she, th'assistance Thine. O Wife, more gentle than the western breeze, Which [loth to part] dwells whisp'ring on the trees: Chaste as the lamb th'indulgent pastor leads To living streams thro' Sharon's flow'ry meads; Mild as the voice of comfort to despair; Fair as the spring, and yet more true than fair “Quis te felicissimum conjugis pudore non prædicavit?” Philosophiæ Verba ad Boetium.

Weep not to read these melancholy strains; Change courts for cells, and coronets for chains.— No greatness can be lost, where God remains! Say, what avails me, that I boast the fame And deathless honours of the Manlian name; Th'unsoil'd succession of renown'd descent, Equal to Time's historical extent “Quod si quid in nobilitate bonum, id solum esse arbitror, ut imposita nobilibus necessitudo videatur, nè à majorum virtute degenerent.” L. III, Pros. 6.? One of my ancestors receiv'd his doom There, where he sav'd the liberties of Rome! Did not another plunge into the wave The Gaulish champion, and his country save? Did not a third, [and harder was his fate] Make his own child a victim for the state? And did not I my wealth and life consume, To bless at once Theodoric and Rome?— But all is cancell'd and forgotten since; Past merits were reproaches to my prince! As my own glory serv'd to ruin me, Thy birth from Symmachus avails not thee: Thy meekness, prudence, beauty, innocence, Thy knowledge, and thy virtues, gave offence. When excellence is eminent, like thine, Our eyes are dazzled with too bright a shrine; Death must the medium give, that makes it mildly shine. What visionary hope the wretch beguiles, Who founds his confidence on Princes smiles? True to their int'rest, mindless of their trust, Convenient is the regal term for just. The plant, my cultivating hands had made A spreading tree, oppress'd me with its shade; Ambition push'd forth many a vig'rous shoot, And rancid jealousy manur'd the root: Ingratitude a willing heart mis-led, And sycophants the growing mischief fed, Till th'Arian-Sophist Theodoric in his heart was strongly inclined to Arianism. crept thro' all restraint; The Tempter ply'd him, and there split the saint.

The latter invited the former to a banquet, and killed him with his own hand.. And O, how weak my skill, how vain my toils, To sow religion's seeds in courtly soils! The few surviving plants that fix'd their root, O'ercharg'd with specious herbage, bore no fruit, Gorg'd to satiety with unctuous juice From a fat earth, and form'd for bulk, not use; Till all the cultivating hand receives Is steril plenty of luxuriant leaves —“nescia falcis “Sylva comam tollit, fructumque expirat in umbras.” Stat.

If errors purely human are forgiv'n, I dare present my last appeal to Heav'n. Religion and clear honesty, combin'd, Made up the short full system of my mind. Nicely I mark'd the quicksands of the state, The crown's encroachments, and the people's hate: Fore-warn'd my prince of arbitrary sway, And taught his subjects willingly t'obey: Thus ev'ry thing conspir'd to one great end, The nation was my child, the king my friend. Both still I serv'd with uniform intent, The good of both with equal fervour meant; And, wheresoe'er th'infraction first arose, Still judg'd th'aggressors man's and nature's foes. Monarchs, sometimes, discard thro' fear, or hate, Those, whose good sense and virtues poize the state: So mariners, when storms the ocean sweep, Commit their guardian-ballast to the deep. Methinks, in these my solitudes, I hear Tricilla whisp'ring in the tyrant's ear L. I, Pros. 4., Assert the glories which are all thy own; And lop the branch that over-shades the throne; When he and malice know, I taught no more Than ev'ry righteous statesman taught before. I show'd my prince The precepts of government, comprized in the following lines, and recommended by Boetius, are extracted almost verbatim from Cassiodorus's Letters. Cassiodorus was secretary to Theodoric and Athalaric, kings of the Goths. He was a statesman of great genius, and an author of wonderful invention. An ancient writer of the Church has justly marked out the difference betwixt a King and a Tyrant: “They have Both (says he) absolute power and abundance of people under their command; but exert their authority and power in a very different manner: For the former seeks only the good of those whom he governs, and hazards all, even his life, that they may live in peace and safety.” He then gives the contrast of their characters in more full detail. Synesius Bishop of Cyrene to the Emperor Arcadius.—“The first of regal arts Was to reign monarch of the people's hearts: [Swift to encourage, eager to redress, The steward of a nation's happiness;] Taught him, each gift he gave, by truth to scan; T'adapt the man to place, not place to man; To guard the public wealth with anxious care, Studious of peace, but still prepar'd for war: Taught him, that princes of celestial kind, Like Numa, cultivate the field and mind Ovid. Met. XV, v 482.: Warn'd him 'gainst pow'r, which suffers no controul; But mostly that, which persecutes the soul: Then by examples, or from reason, show'd, That none are true to man who're false to God A saying of Constantius Chlorus, the Father of Constantine the Great.; And that our lives, except by freedom blest, Are a dull passive slavery at best.” Hence righteous kings of softer clay are made; Not for their subjects mis'ry, but their aid The character of a just and pious prince is finely marked by Isaiah, Ch. xvi, v 5. “In mercy shall the throne be established; and he shall upon it in truth, in the tabernacle of David; judging and seeking judgement, and hasting righteousness.”. True liberty, by pious monarchs giv'n, Is emblematic manna rain'd from heav'n: Without it, ev'ry appetite is pall'd, The body fetter'd, and the mind enthrall'd Much to this purpose is a passage in the Son of Sirach:—“As long as thou livest, and hast breath in thee, give not thyself over to to any. In all thy works keep to thyself the pre-eminence, and leave not a stain in thine honour.” ECCLUS. Ch. xxxiii.. Thus when by chance some rustic hand invades The nightingale's recess in poplar-shades, And bears the pris'ner with offensive care To Nero's house of gold, and Nero's fare; Th'aërial chorister, no longer free, Wails and detests man's civil cruelty: Still dumb th'imprison'd sylvan bard remains; [Your human bards make music with their chains;] And when from his exalted cage he sees The hills, the dales, the lawns, the streams, the trees, He looks on courtly food with loathing eyes, And sighs for liberty, and worms, and flies “Quæ canit altis garrula ramis “Ales, caveæ clauditur antro. “Huic licet illita pocula melle “Largasque dapes dulci studio “Ludens hominum cura ministret; “Si tamen alto saliens tecto “Nemorum gratas viderit umbras, “Sparsas pedibus proterit escas; “Sylvas tantum mœsta requirit.” Boet. de Consolat.

Brave as our sex, and as thy own resign'd; Unconquer'd, like thy beauty, be thy mind!— Wretch that I was, how dar'd I to complain? Heav'n's chastisements are never dealt in vain! In something, or my pride or frailty err'd, And my just doom was certain, tho' deferr'd. The mists of twilight-sunshine, and esteem, Made me not greater grow, but greater seem. When I the paths of human grandeur trod, Might not my alien-heart diverge from God? Might I not raise my kins-folk and my friends From private reasons, and for private ends; Exclusive of the better Few, who stay Far from the solar walk, and court's high-way “In chusing men who are to discharge the highest offices, the safest conduct is to take the man who goes out of his way in order to decline it, and not the man who intrudes boldly for it.” St. Bernard.? Might I not swell too much on earthly pow'r, Man's ideot-play-thing, gewgaw of an hour? Or might not false compliance, flatt'ry, art, Un-hinge my truth, un-christianize my heart?

Pains and diseases; stripes and labour too The hint of this Emblem is taken from our venerable and religious Poet F. Quarles, L. III, Embl. 4. Mr. Dryden used to say, that Quarles exceeded him in the facility of Rhyming. Quarles's Book, and the Emblematical Prints therein contained, are chiefly taken from the Pia Desideria of Hugo Hermannus. The engravings were originally designed by that celebrated artist C.

Gracious Being, please To calm our fears, and give the body ease! The poor man, and the slave of ev'ry kind, 'Midst pains and toils may gleams of comfort find; But who can bear the sickness of the mind?

No more the sun delights, nor lawns, nor trees; The vernal blossoms, or the summer's breeze. No longer Echo makes the dales rejoice With sportive sounds, and pictures of a voice Agreeably to this, is a lovely piece of imagery in the holy Scriptures: “The earth mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed, and hewn down; Sharon is like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.” Isaiah Ch. xxxiii, v 9.: Th'aërial choir, which sung so soft and clear, Now grates harsh music to the froward ear: The gently murm'ring rills offend from far, And emulate the clangour of a war: Books have no wit, the liveliest wits have none; And hope, the last of ev'ry friend, is gone! Nor rest nor joy to Virtue's self are giv'n, Till the disease is rectify'd by Heav'n. And yet this Iliad of intestine woes [So frail is man] from seeming nothings rose: A drop of acrid juice, a blast of air, Th'obstruction of a tube as fine as hair; Or spasm within a labyrinth of threads, More subtile far than those the spider spreads Isaiah Ch. lix, v 5..

Sandys understood the passage in the same manner as I do. See his excellent Paraphrase on Job, Folio, page 49, London 1637.

Oft have we sought [and fruitless oft] to gain A short parenthesis 'twixt pain and pain; But, sick'ning at the chearfulness of light, The soul has languish'd for th'approach of night: Again, immerst in shades, we seem to say, O day-spring Job Ch. xxxviii, v 12.

In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! For the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes wherewith thou shalt see.” See also Job Ch. iii, v 8.. On this side death th'Unhappy sure are curst, Who sigh for change, and think the present worst: Who weep unpity'd, groan without relief; “There is no end nor measure of their grief!” The Happy have waste twelve-months to bestow; But Those can spare all time, who live in woe!

Ah, what is man, that demi-god on earth? Proud of his knowledge, glorying in his birth; Profane corrector of th'Almighty's laws, Full of th'effect, forgetful of the cause! Why boast of reason, and yet reason ill? Why talk of choice, yet follow erring will? Why vaunt our liberty, and prove the slave Of all ambition wants, or follies crave? This is the lot of him, sur-nam'd the wise, Who lives mistaken, and mistaken dies! The Sick less happy, and yet happier live; For pains and maladies are God's reprieve: This respite, 'twixt the grave and cradle giv'n, Is th'interpos'd parenthesis of Heav'n! Too often we complain—But flesh is weak; Silence would waste us, and the heart would break. Behold yon' rose, the poor despondent cries, [Pain on his brow, and anguish in his eyes] What healthy verdure paints its juicy shoots, What equal circulation feeds the roots: At morning-dawn it feels the dew-ting'd ray, But opens all its bosom to the day. No art assists it, and no toil it takes Matth. Ch. vi, v 28., Slumbers at ev'ning, and with morning wakes Concerning the Sleep of Plants, see an ingenious Latin Treatise lately published in Sweden..

The hint of this similie is taken from Quarles.Just so, the gen'rous falcon, long immur'd In doleful cell, by osier-bars secur'd, Laments her fate; till, flitting swiftly by, Th'aerial prize attracts her eager eye: Instant she summons all her strength and fire; Her aspect kindles fierce with keen desire; She prunes her tatter'd plumes in conscious pride, And bounds from perch to perch, and side to side: Impatient of her jail, and long detain'd, She breaks the bounds her liberty restrain'd: Then, having gain'd the point by Heav'n design'd, Soars 'midst the clouds, and proves her high-born kind. When Adam did his paradise forego, He earn'd his hard-bought bread with sweating brow.— Give us the labour, but suppress the woe! Merit we boast not: But Christ's sacred side Has pour'd for all its sacramental tide. No sin, no guile, no blemishes had He; A self-made slave to set the captive free! Yet pain and anguish still too far presume; Just are Heav'n's ways, and righteous is its doom. All chastisements, before we reach the grave, Are bitter med'cines, kindly meant to save. Thus let the rhet'ric of our suff'rings move; The voice of grief is oft the voice of love “There is sometimes a certain pleasure in weeping: It is a sort of consolation to an afflicted person to be thoroughly sensible of his affliction.” St. Ambrose.! The bed of sickness, [after cares and strife] Is weak man's cradle for a second life; Death's but a moment; and, before we die, We touch the threshold of eternity! So, stretch'd beneath the juniper's chill shade, Th'afflicted prophet Elijah. in despondence pray'd: “Oh, take the burthen of my life away, “Dead are my sires; nor better I than they:” At length a seraph cry'd, “arise and eat; “Behold thy bev'rage, and behold thy meat: “Heav'n's one repast shall future strength supply “For forty days, till Horeb meets thy eye 2 Kings, Ch. xix, v. 4–8..” The Good Man neither fears, desponds, nor faints, Arm'd with the heav'nly panoply Eph.

Look back a moment, pause a while “If you labour for a time, you will afterwards enjoy an eternity of rest. Your sufferings are of a short duration, your joy will last for ever: And if your resolution wavers, and is going to desert you, turn your eyes towards Mount Calvary, and consider what Christ suffered for you, innocent as he was. This consideration will enable you to say in the event, that your sufferings lasted only for a moment.” Idem., and stay.

No death of sickness, with a common tear;— No soft extinction claims our sorrows here; But anguish, shame, and agonizing passion! The riches of the world, and worldly praise, No monument of gratitude can prove; Obedience only the great debt repays, An imitative heart, and undivided love! IV To see the image of th'All-glorious Pow'r Suspend his immortality, and dwell In mortal bondage, tortur'd ev'ry hour; A self-made pris'ner in a dolesome cell, Victim for sin, and conqueror of hell “Nolo vivere sine vulnere, cum Te videam vulneratum.” Bonavent. “To know God, without knowing our misery, creates pride: To know misery, without knowing Christ, causes despondence.” St. Augustin.! Lustration for offences not his own! Th'Unspotted for th'impure resign'd his breath; No other off'ring could thy crimes attone:— Then blame thy Saviour's love, but not his death. V From this one prospect draw thy sole relief, Here learn submission, passive duties learn; Here drink the calm oblivion of thy grief: Eschew each danger, ev'ry good discern, And the true wages of thy virtue earn. Reflect, O man, on such stupendous love, Such sympathy divine, and tender care “They make a free-will offering to God, who in the midst of their sufferings preserve their gratitude and acknowledgements.” Cassian.; Beseech the Paraclete “God's Holy Spirit worketh in the following manner in his rational children. It instructs, moves, and admonishes: As for example; it instructs the reason, moves the will, and admonishes the memory.” St. Gregor. in Moral. thine heart to move, And offer up to Heav'n this silent pray'r. VI Translated from the famous French Ode of M. de Barreaux. “Grand Dieu! Tes jugemens sont remplis d' équité,” &amp;c.Great God, thy judgements are with justice crown'd, To human crimes and errors gracious still; Yet, tho' thy mercies more and more abound, Right reason spares not fresh-existing ill, Nor can thy goodness counter-work thy will. Ah no! The gloom of sin so dreadful shows, That horror, guilt, and death the conscience fill: Eternal laws our happiness oppose; Thy nature and our lives are everlasting foes! VII Severe thy truth, yet glorious is thy scheme; Complete the vengeance of thy just desire; See from our eyes the gushing torrents stream, Yet strike us, blast us with celestial fire; Our doom, and thy decrees, alike conspire. Yet dying we will love thee and adore:— Where shall the flaming flashes of thy ire Transpierce our bodies? Ev'ry nerve and pore With Christ's immaculate blood is cover'd o'er and o'er. “When we praise God we may speak much, and yet come short: Wherefore in sum, He is all. When you glorify Him, exalt Him as much as you can: For even yet He will far exceed. And when you exalt Him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary: For you can never go far enough.” Ecclus. Ch. xliii, v. 27–30. FINIS.</field>
