      <field name="fulltext">TO JOHN PENDER, ESQ., M.P., AS A LIBERAL PATRON OF ART, AND AS ONE ILLUSTRATING THE CHARACTER OF A BRITISH MERCHANT, This Volume, WITH EVERY SENTIMENT OF REGARD AND ESTEEM, IS GRATEFULLY DEDICATED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ART AND FASHION. Ferdinand, a young Artist. Augusta, his Cousin. Scene—An Artist's Studio; busts, casts, draperies, fishing-rods, &amp;c., &amp;c., lying about. FERDINAND at his easel, singing. Love said to Apollo one day, Can't you paint me a likeness of Venus? If not by yourself, I dare say We might manage to sketch her between us. But Venus declared, when she saw The image o'er which they'd been teasing, That a child might be able to draw A portrait more perfect and pleasing. Ah me! not e'en the gods can Beauty please! Who'd be a portrait painter? Better slave At any trade . . . . . better . . . . . (singing) “A child might be able to draw.” Could I but realise Imagination, Give permanence to Fancy, it were well; But brighter visions visit me in dreams Than, waking, I can execute. Sleep, sweet sleep! Thou seem'st the soul of Art; king of a world In which all others but resolve themselves! Thine is the key to the impossible, The wonderful, the magical— (a knock at the door). Come in! If sprite or fay, Make good thy way, And what thou mean'st by coming, say! Enter Augusta, dressed in the extreme of fashion. FERDINAND. Ah! Cousin mine, a thousand, thousand welcomes! My eager hand hath scarce thy portrait left. Methinks the head doth credit to my skill; It fills the room with life—effuses light; When cover'd, all seems dark. How lik'st thou it? AUGUSTA. Why, yes: 'tis like, no doubt, . . . . but . . . . FERDINAND. But!— “A child might be able to”— Your pardon, coz; I deem that portrait, sketchy though it seem, As near the sweet perfection of thy face As hand can limn; the likeness free and true. But for the dress—I am a bungler there; The trimming is fantastic, and the rest Needeth some toning down. AUGUSTA. Oh, that is easy! FERDINAND. You think 'tis easy, then, to catch “a likeness,” Copy a nose, a mouth, a chin! You're right. But copying nature is not all that's needed; Something behind, unfeatured and unnamed— The dewy light that rims the morning cloud And lends a life to what was dull and cold— Such is the light the Artist hath to find, Else may the portrait show but spiritless. AUGUSTA. Certes, a face is like a lamp unlit Without the mind; it is the living mind That shapes expression. FERDINAND. I know an Artist— Ay, a great one too, his name still famous— Who to each sitter took the callipers, And measured, inch by inch, each feature's place, Position, and proportion; after that— AUGUSTA. He took his canvas (smiling). FERDINAND. No such thing, my coz! He made a drawing, finish'd and exact, So bold, so vigorous in execution, The after painting scarce could rival it; In fact, the drawing beat the canvas oft. There was a subtle sentiment he lost In the translation: still he persevered, Slowly, yet all determined to excel. No toil thought he too much; knowing right well Mere feature's truth is not true portraiture. AUGUSTA. You paint not thus? FERDINAND. No: I rub in at once; Yet question if 'tis quicker in the end. I alter and re-alter; at my whim Touch and re-touch. That mouth, which seems so slight, Cost me some hours; I've had it in and out Full twenty times: at length I took a book, When, all at once, I saw the matter clear; A few light touches, and the lips had life; The portrait spoke: that is— AUGUSTA. It should have done! But this would seem a thing of chance, not Art; One happy moment, worth ten studious hours! FERDINAND. Right—and yet wrong; the myst'ry deeper lies. The thing to catch is not the outward shape; Mere form a common copyist may reach; But inward feeling, sentiment, emotion— The mind that in its subtle currency Illuminates each lineament, and gives At different moments different effects— 'Tis this the Artist tries. . . . . AUGUSTA. No doubt, no doubt; One cannot reach the soul with compasses, Nor take its depth, nor breadth, nor altitude. FERDINAND. You've seen my Hamlet? Well, it cost some thought; The critics gave me credit for the “Ghost.” A presence, vague and supernatural— A shade majestic, worthy of the realm It left for earth: for that they proffer'd praise Which cost the slightest trouble. 'Twas the mien, The mind of Hamlet task'd my utmost power; Again the mouth proved difficult to hit, And for a week it ran a daily change. At last, one touch: lo! 'twas the right effect; A nervous, sensitive, expressive mouth. The critics lent no echo to my Hope That therein would my better fame be found, But praised the Ghost!— The Ghost!—well, Fame's a ghost, And Hope, too oft, a false Astrologer. Talking of that—of Hope—you like not then The portrait? AUGUSTA. If tongue may freely breathe it, I much the portrait of our Aunt prefer. FERDINAND. Our Aunt dress'd simpler. What can mortal do With all this heap of frill and frippery? Art hates gay trimmings: they distract the eye. What lovelier to a lovely countenance Than plain attire—simplicity of garb? I tell thee, Fashion, like a climbing weed, Destroys the very thing it feeds upon! Saw'st thou e'er graft upon a nobler stock, On alder, oak, laburnum, sycamore? The active root develops its own life In vigorous shoots from out the parent stem But these, at once, the gardener destroys: The nature of the tree is sacrificed For the more gaudy, showy, flaunting graft! 'Tis thus with you the graft of Fashion shows Upon a nobler nature. AUGUSTA. Indeed! I . . . FERDINAND. Nay, stay and hear the rest. As feeds that graft On qualities superior to its own, Shoots, born to rise and soar, and drink the air That circles nearer heaven, so Fashion preys, So feeds, on Nature's purer elements. Nature and she are foes. She, Fashion, stands Cold, artificial, ever in extremes; She dwells within the world without a heart; Convention is her god, all vulgar else, And than be vulgar better not be born. AUGUSTA. I'll hear no more. FERDINAND. Vulgar! what means the word? Nothing's so vulgar as the light of day, Which sits in hovels and lies down with rags; Nothing's so vulgar as the breath of life, Which e'en a rat holds equal with one's self; Nothing— AUGUSTA (passionately). I thought you'd end in nothing!— Now hear me. Fashion—grant me patience! 'Tis profanation thus to libel her. She's the world's mirror: people see themselves As she reflects them, or they see not life; They breathe but in the presence of her power. Beauty lends homage due, which she repays By making Beauty still more beautiful, Form more attractive, feature more divine; A grace inspired by her supremacy, And reach'd but by her vot'ries. [Walks about. Fashion! yes: A thousand servants wait upon her steps: All hands are busy for her. Ships at sea, Freighted with charms, obey her welcome summons. She keeps the “World” in busy agitation; Shore, quay, and bustling wharf, warehouse and shop, Teem with her queenly orders. She keeps state, And every stone grows hot with rolling wheels; She languishes, and every trade falls dull. Fashion, indeed! you teach where you've to learn. I tell thee, Painter, let but Fashion take Thy genius by the hand—let her but speak— And she will turn thy palette into gold, Transmute thy colours into costly gems; Patrons, in throngs, shall lounge about thy doors, And Peers outbid each other for the next Great effort of that hand which Fashion crowns With her supreme distinction. Fashion! FERDINAND. What humour's this? lo, what a heat you're in!— Eye, cheek, and lip, glowing with lovely fire;— A moment sit and let me paint you thus, [Augusta walks about. Each ringlet trembling with strange brilliancy; Passion becomes you; what a look was there! AUGUSTA. Ferdinand! . . . . FERDINAND. Well, Cousin! AUGUSTA. Speak where you will, But never more to me; never . . . . FERDINAND. For what? Well may sincerity be rare on earth. The face belie the feeling, tongue shun truth— [A pause. Nay, if thus hurt then am I grieved indeed. Augusta! AUGUSTA. Taunts, taunts, taunts, nothing but taunts! For ever rating me, and scouting Fashion. FERDINAND. Because I love—nay, patience—Nature best!— And yet not Nature more than I loved you, Ere Fashion won you! Loved you! yes, love still— Though Fashion seek to cast my quiet life Too far apart from its divinity! I worship—but the shrine finds other fires, And burns to other gods!— AUGUSTA. To be so school'd! FERDINAND. You'll give your hand? AUGUSTA. To be so lectured! Ever we meet to rail, even now you rail— You that should kinder be than any one. FERDINAND. Well, let me own there's truth in what you spoke Of Fashion and her power; yet I prefer To satin robes, and lace, rich gems and flowers, Some Indian village, by some shore remote— Some Mohawk, with his arrow and his bow, Full of that fire immortal Nature lit When she created Man, whose bounding limb, Instinct with power—alive with energy— Ennobled every motion with a grace, To which—now pardon me—to which, dear coz, Fashion is manner'd, artificial, cold; An image, not a being—sign, not fact: A symbol, not a soul! But I have done— Now on my last work give me your decree. [Brings forward a picture, showing village home, with garden, field, and lane, and distant spire.] AUGUSTA (after a pause). Our cottage-home—our dear old cottage-home— The spot a mother's early love made holy! The very lane my school-led footsteps stray'd, Rough with tall fern, and early fox-glove bells,— The mossy spring round which the village maids Would tell their merry secrets; whisper tales Of moonlight meetings,—stories out of school,— Things little birds had told them—happy days! That gather'd pleasure from the simplest source. Sweet days, so fresh with memory's morning dew, What have ye left like that ye took? Oh Home! We never prize thy worth till thou art lost, And then—how dear, how exquisitely dear!— FERDINAND. All things are dear when sorrow shows their worth; Let but a moment be the scanty space Between farewell and absence from the loved, Unknowing the far period of return; And every simple, trivial, common thing Becomes array'd with triple interest. AUGUSTA. The gate, the tree, the little garden-chair, The shady corner where the bird-cage hung; A leaf—a flower—how do they spring to worth When the heart pains to lose them? Would that all Could learn to prize before compell'd to lose! How many would be rich that think they're poor? How many happy that are discontent? How many pining, fretful natures blush To show themselves before true sorrow's face?— Oh home! oh mother!—oh too early lost! I seek ye, but a grave is all I find! FERDINAND (aside). Nature speaks now. AUGUSTA. That mother, Fred, you loved her dearly once. FERDINAND. May memory scorn me when I love her not: All that I am is owing to her worth; An orphan 'neath her care,—her brother's child! She must have loved that brother passing well, For oft I've known her gaze on me with tears, And wet my cheek with kisses! When she died— No, no! not died, such goodness never dies!— But when God's angels bore that saint to heaven, A letter on her pillow lay, address'd “To her young painter,” whom she pray'd might win A name among Earth's gifted. On one page (I've read it oft, dear cousin, oft 'mid thoughts That blinded me with tears)—on one page She gave her daughter to a heart she knew Honestly loved her with a manly truth, Deep, firm, and lasting as the pulse within,— But you—you have discarded the poor painter. AUGUSTA. You would not have a hand without a heart? Such legacy could not enrich the heir! FERDINAND. Enforced affection? What? Against thy will— Receive a cold, reluctant, backward heart? Never! Oh God, that letter! [He seizes the letter, and attempts to destroy it. And yet, thy mother's last, last written lines, That loving, tender—no, I cannot tear, But I can yield it! Never more my cheek Shall sweetly slumber o'er the hope it gave; My pillow never more its seal shall press Whilst far in dreams I clomb the steep of fame, And offer'd name and fortune at thy feet: Dreams—oh delusions!—dreams that break the heart! One kiss, dear seal—old friends should kiss at parting. Now . . . . quickly . . . . take it! AUGUSTA. Alone? FERDINAND. How mean you? AUGUSTA. Not take the honest hand which holds the letter? FERDINAND. Be merciful—be candid—be sincere: Mistake not sudden sympathy for love. You hesitate, . . . . you do not take the letter. AUGUSTA. Not hesitate—if, if you think my life Can make your own more happy; if my love Can make existence brighter in your sight; Can—can reward you for the love I know You cherish for your giddy, graceless cousin, Then . . . . FERDINAND. Then . . . . Oh, sainted shade—inheritor of heaven— Who wert my friend, my one true friend on earth, My parent when I needed parent most, Look down, sweet saint, and bless thy grateful children! AUGUSTA (after a pause). This picture— FERDINAND. Well? AUGUSTA. It never must be sold. FERDINAND (struggling to recover his usual tone and feeling). So; every artist his own purchaser. 'Twere pleasant could it last; but much I fear Such system scarcely may become the “Fashion!” AUGUSTA. Fashion? again, again! FERDINAND. An artist's wife . . . . AUGUSTA. Seeketh no fleeting aid of ornament. But how we talk!—you were defeated, Sir: The victor, not the vanquish'd, proffers terms! [Exeunt. REYNOLDS. Scene—Dining-room in Sir Joshua's house, Leicester Square. Enter Reynolds and Goldsmith. REYNOLDS. But when was this? GODSMITH. Less than an hour ago. REYNOLDS. Garrick and Johnson quarrelling on Art, And questioning “the Beautiful”—what then? GOLDSMITH. Johnson declared all Beauty was a dream— A fiction merely; something people saw But through their fancy; and as Fancy chose The jade misled her idle votaries. REYNOLDS. Pleasant, indeed! How came the subject on? Johnson lacks faith in painting: he avers That pictures are but toys—things to please babes. GOLDSMITH. The Doctor's weak of sight, and roughly speaks. REYNOLDS. But strong of mind; and, 'faith, he argues well. Proceed with their discourse—how prosper'd it? GOLDSMITH. “Beauty,” quoth Garrick, “is not definite; There are no general principles for Beauty. The features which delight us in one face May suddenly displease us in the next. Beauty is not a thing for square or rule.” “Sir, I deny it,” Johnson, growling, broke; “There is a settled principle of Form, Which, injured, you beget deformity. Rule?—Nature, Sir, submits herself to rule! One thing is needed you to judge aright— Discrimination.” “I cannot comprehend,” Said David, stiffly, . . . . “Of course you cannot— People, too oft, are slow of comprehension. Beauty, good lack! what knowest thou of it, Except in paint and foil? Beauty, with thee, Must at the side-scene make her entrances, Or move 'neath groves cut by the carpenter; Her song-bird is an orchestra—her stars The stage-lights; knowing nought of seasons, but As shown by bill or prompter's calendar; Her seasons are theatrical—her fruits, Her flowers, spring not from Nature's treasury, But make-believes—peaches of wood and wax; Not from the green-house, David, but the Green-room! Beauty!” stormed he, “i'faith, when saw'st thou it, Save through the tube of operatic glass?” At which, indignant, Garrick turned aside And left the Doctor victor. REYNOLDS. Pooh! mere stuff, The loveliest women born have trod the stage! GOLDSMITH. But, after all, who knows what Beauty is? Is it a type of feeling, fancy-like? A question of localities—of shores?— Of nationalities?—To Caffre's eye The Black is beautiful. REYNOLDS. And why not Black? Of the Ideal, Beauty is the centre:— Imagination, genius, feeling, passion, Pay homage to the greatness there enshrined. Art seeks to penetrate the inner veil Where beauty sits concealed, but oftener fails Than finds the hidden labyrinth to her feet. Every creation of victorious Art But vibrates to that centre; finest tones But echo that interior harmony; The loveliest conception doth but shape A feeble image of the beauty shrined Within that vast ideal . . . . GOLDSMITH. This for Art: Yet simpler illustration may be found. REYNOLDS. Ever the old question, “What is Beauty?” You say, as thousands say, a presence fair, Of easy elegance, elastic step, As bounding as the sparkling foot of Spring; Expression that takes captive every grace, And glads the sense to gaze, as though the world Narrowed its orb to where one being moved, And all the rest were barren! If 'twere thus, Then to be thus were sure to be admired: But there's a charm the gazer's self must find Within himself, a portion of his life— His own conception, feeling, sentiment, Or Beauty's power is wanting. Some affect A slender, delicate, half-girlish form, Which fills them with a dream of loveliness, Of purity, and maiden innocence; Others select a full, round, regal shape, Reflecting some ideal of their own, Some Juno of their heart's mythology, And slenderness is silliness to them! GOLDSMITH. 'Tis true, Each loving heart hath in its central core Some fair imaginary sketch, some shape, Some dream angelic of the bride to be, Some unknown wonder, which shall yet appear; Crossing the travel of their daily life Find they but one, one charm, of those conceived And shaped within—their eyes create the rest! They see, in fact, what others cannot see; And what seems “plain” to cold, unloving eyes, To those that love, enzone beatitude. As there is music which awakes no chord Within some breasts, all perfect though it be, So is there Beauty which affects us not, While plainer faces thrill us with a joy Unfelt, unimaged, unbelieved before! Who can interpret, then, what Beauty is? REYNOLDS. Woman's a riddle—Beauty is the same. GOLDSMITH. To me,—nay, do not laugh,—in sooth, to me There is a spirit in creation which Seems cognizant of Art! The woodland stream Ripples its sylvan course by mead and rock, By nest of moorland lark, by park of deer, Or sedgy nook, that would a painter choose; The smallest flower that decks the hem of Spring Seeks, as by instinct, some romantic spot, Some shady slope, to dress its beauty in. Earth closely knits in universal Art The commonwealth of seasons, and their change; Nature, a colourist—supreme as truth— Paints with a pencil dipped in setting suns! REYNOLDS. You sail in Fancy's barque, and touch on shores Seen by the dreamer's eye:—beware the rock! GOLDSMITH. Nay, dream it is not;—but a certainty! The wild rose climbs the gate, or slyly seeks Some old white gable to display herself; Conscious of contrast, or, in playful mood, Toys with the sun, and kisses her own shade. REYNOLDS. Why, this is sketching!—you've a soul for Art. GOLDSMITH. From youth I grew a lover of that light Which warms the altar of “the Beautiful!” I loved Mythology; for it to me Was the religion of the Beautiful! But Thought is ever in advance of Action, Could we achieve what we in thought perceive, Then Greatness were a step of easy reach! REYNOLDS. Within the mind of man there glows a fire Which hath its source from some diviner orb Than warms our world—spark of a higher sphere; There, in its full integrity, exists What we may term, for lack of better name, The “Central Form”—the principle of Taste. 'Tis this that to the flagging fancy gives Sense of a nobler mark—something beyond What it hath yet achieved—some loftier step Than it hath yet ascended: promptly as This “Central Form” exerts its influence, So its possessor moveth on to Fame; Retaining this, in its divine perfection, No man, no artist, actor, sculptor, bard, Can rest content with failure: no, 'tis this, This inward sense of something unachieved, Felt, vaguely seen, and difficult of aim, Upward invites us, till the mounting mind Catches the light that can immortalise!— This sudden power, not in itself a thought, Yet aye compelling thought;—not Beauty, but Extracting it; that Beauty unto which Each particle of universal life Is more or less related:—this is Genius, Or 'tis the guide of Genius—'tis the Judge That, though reproving, still encourageth! You are an artist, every poem shows— Simple, descriptive, earnest, full of grace And manly tenderness; your pen excels The painter's pencil; surely then you feel That inward sense of something unperform'd, Which yet your thought may grasp with diligence! GOLDSMITH. Conscious full often am I of a charm In word or thought which yet I fail to reach; And can believe it may be thus with Art. Paintings! how they lead the mind to nature, Inspire the spirit, lift the thought to God!— All that in woman's life is beautiful, All that is innocent and sweet in childhood, All that is high, heroic, great in man! Of fancy and reality—of taste And truth—of glory and enthusiasm:— How they illuminate the life of life! Paintings to me are Prophets of Advancement! REYNOLDS. Poet thou art—and Nature form'd thee such; But all too wild a spirit for that art Where Judgment, more than Fancy, sits and acts. Who wins must labour! not await the hour Of some descending vision, some fair muse, Seen in the dreams of foolish votaries. To know one's object, and to learn the mode Of reaching best that object; profiting By every study ancient Art hath left; By contemplation, and laborious zeal; These, humble as they show and poor in sound, Have royal right to epithets divine! These will achieve what Dreamers ne'er achieve, Led by the hope of some propitious star! Some power, not won by labour, but a gift! Alas, these gifts, how many a churchyard tells Of broken hearts, of tears, of blighted homes! The Halls of Fate are crowded by the Gifted; The very dust is consecrate to woes, Which found their birth in the insane belief That untaught genius wins a world's renown, Labour in Art scorn'd as mechanical: Would that my voice each ardent youth might reach, Who by his parent's table draws and dreams Of heaven-born genius and the stars of Fame. The only spirit worth the listening to, Is that which bids men Work!—toil, study, learn. This, Inspiration flouts as something low, Unworthy her diviner attributes! GOLDSMITH. All men are not alike; whether it be In brain or blood, in muscle or in nerve. A power, to man inexplicable, still Infuses nature; pulses of a life As yet unveil'd: nay, hath not temperament, Organisation, something still to do With those emotions which translation seek In Art, Invention, Sculpture, Poetry? Thoughts come uncall'd for, and exert a power Of which we are the servants, not the master. Some hearts can vibrate to the simplest chord, Others an orchestra may fail to rouse. Beauty? It dwells in Truth, in Goodness, Grace; Beauty is mental more than physical! You laugh, you think not thus?—now, what's amiss? REYNOLDS. Keep that, my Goldie, for some future verse. Enter Servant. So please you, Sir, the little girl attends You met with strawberries, and bade to call. REYNOLDS. Strawberry Girl,—well, let her call at ten. [Exit Servant. GOLDSMITH. The Strawberry Girl, pray let me see her. I have a tenderness for childish life: A man—yet something of a child myself. Imagination builds her paradise Deep in the wondering nature of a child: The great, the wise, heroic, fortunate, How shine they in the books that childhood reads! There is a land but known to children's feet, Wherein grow flowers that never bloom elsewhere; As some child-angel, passing by, had thrown The garment of her glory over earth! Birds sing therein, whose notes, we know, were brought From groves by fairies haunted; brooklets flow In music such as heard Aladdin, when, Full to the lips, in fortune he returned! Oh, joy, to tread the ground of child-romance! REYNOLDS. Come, see the girl, and tell your story out, Or write a book—a second Blue Beard tale, A Cinderella, or new Riding Hood; Some other story of a Wondrous Lamp! Something to rank with Giants of the Past! [Exeunt, Reynolds bantering. GAINSBOROUGH. Scene—The room of an old-fashioned house in Sudbury. Enter young Gainsborough, with his mother, speaking earnestly. GAINSBOROUGH. Well, but, dear mother, I dislike these looms— Treddles and shuttles, steaming vats and stoves. MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. Speak with respect, dear boy, and quietly. GAINSBOROUGH. I would not hint a feeling otherwise Than kind, and most respectful to my sire; Others, however, may have feelings too. MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. Forget your feelings, and remember fortune. Think what a life of industry may yield,— Wealth to command the highest influence; Wealth to assist the poor—to raise the weak; To be a benefactor and a friend Unto the town that bred you! That were well! GAINSBOROUGH. But to inhale the sickly breath of crowds; Exchange the fresh glad breeze of early morn For the close atmosphere of carded wool; Sweet Nature's quiet face, for the quick whirl And everlasting din of shafts and wheels! No; Nature's manufactory for me: She moves on silently, though reproducing Faster than man, with all his new-found helps. MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. Your brother Humphrey would not argue thus. GAINSBOROUGH. Make Humphrey, then, the weaver; let him be The right hand of my father; let his name Continue on the trade of “crapes” and “says.” I'll carve out fortune with my palette knife; A brush shall be my engine; and for steam, For steam, I'll get up perseverance—yes, High-pressure perseverance. I'll not fail! Never believe I'll fail. MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. Consider this: A tenth-rate fortune is a thing to prize; A tenth-rate reputation—what is that? GAINSBOROUGH. But I'll be first!— MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. First?—my poor boy—be first? GAINSBOROUGH. I will work out the poetry of Art; Make painting read as easily as a book; Illustrate life and the intents of life; Bid Nature sit for likeness of herself, And fix the evanescent, by a wand Potent as young Aladdin's. You will see! My colours, these poor colours, shall be actors, And with each day's performance bring me fame. Kings, queens, and nobles, warriors, ministers, Shall tread the stage, and keep it with applause. The world itself shall be my theatre!— Mother, there is a bond between us twain Which makes affection but one common pulse Guiding two hearts—'tis instinct, some would say: Mother, there is an instinct to be great— And that I feel!—throbbing each ardent pulse, Coursing my veins as if to win the goal. Can Nature err who thus reveals herself? MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. Your father's disappointment—think of that! GAINSBOROUGH. He'll not be disappointed—or, if so, But for a time—a very little time. What is this wealth, of which he talks so much? Death, that can make even a Crœsus poor, Cannot deprive the artist of his gains! No man hath more than a life-interest In what his toil amasses. Death stays all, Nothing he taketh with him: not so Fame— It lends a halo even to the tomb, Crowns the dead brow, honours the lifeless hand, Enrobes the mortal with immortal worth:— Death cannot rob the artist of his due, For it enricheth e'en his very dust! And for his life—think of his glowing life! To linger in the light of golden eves; Take lessons of the clouds, the streams, the hills; Ramble 'mid woody rocks and winding glades; To watch the panorama of the roads,— The rustic cart to distant market bound, The harvest waggon on its rumbling way, Children beneath the hedgerow gathering haws, The ploughman and his team, or tripping lass With wicker basket and her weekly eggs. All country pictures have a charm for me! The sheep that spot the mead, like drifting snow; The lowing kine within the sedgy pool; Crows wandering home before the dusk of eve; The aged woodman shelt'ring from the storm; Even the shepherd dog, by meadow gate, Waiting some well-known footstep, are enough To fill my mind with pictures yet to be! MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. Manhood succeeds to youth—and manhood sighs To find youth's world a dream! Could I but think Thy way were sure! GAINSBOROUGH. Be sure I'll bring you fame; My name shall be an honour to your years, And, as you walk, people that pass shall say, That is the mother of young Gainsborough. Oh! what a joy, some day to hear you own,— But once my son proved backward to my wish; But once—and after that no son more true; My wish rose not so high as he did mount. Fame then how sacred—how divinely dear— How doubly welcome, if my mother's heart But share the harvest which her son hath won! Could I yet live to hear you own at last— My son, your choice was right! You were my hope; But now you are my pride! MRS. GAINSBOROUGH. You are my pride! And God make good your hope. [She falls on his neck, weeping. HAYDON. (THE TWO EXHIBITIONS.) Scene—A room in the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, engaged by Haydon for the exhibition of his two important pictures, “The Banishment of Aristides,” and “The Burning of Rome.” HAYDON. The world may say I've fail'd; I have not fail'd: If I set truth 'fore men they will not see, 'Tis they who fail, not I. My faith holds firm, And time will prove me right; meantime I feel As martyrs feel who suffer for the Truth! Art should illustrate principle; give strength To virtue; lift the soul to God! It claims A higher, nobler province than to deck The walls of lordly owners; than to be Mere furniture for mansions. Art—High Art— Should foster the intelligence of nations, Commemorate the loftiest deeds of man! Enter Lady Ethgrove and Party. LADY ETHGROVE. La, bless me, not a creature—I declare; How vastly awkward—'tis a change, indeed, To leave the General for Mr. Haydon. PARTY. A change, indeed; but surely you'll not stay? LADY ETHGROVE to HAYDON. You see I've call'd,—I promised you I'd call. The pictures?—ah, I see;—how forcible! Especially “The Burning,”—or, in fact, I scarce know which is best, both are so good. The Banishment of . . . Let me see the bill— Of Aristides—hum! HAYDON. Contemptible! (aside.) Your ladyship, I fear me, hurried here From metal more attractive—General Thumb? LADY ETHGROVE. Oh, such a treasure, such a little dear! Ladies were off'ring guineas for a kiss. HAYDON. Indeed! LADY ETHGROVE. So said: though, 'faith, I offer'd none. Charm'd as I am, I must perforce away. These pictures quite enamour me; but still . . . HAYDON. Your ladyship prefers the General. [Walks about. Enter Lord Lovel. LADY ETHGROVE. Ah, my Lord Lovel, have you seen the “rage,” The wonder of the world?—so perfect, too, From crown to heel a miracle of form! LOVEL. A miracle?—wherever to be seen? LADY ETHGROVE. General Tom Thumb—you must, indeed, go there; The whole world's hurrying there; nothing is heard But sayings, doings, speeches of Tom Thumb! LOVEL. Dwarfs suit not with my humour: when I pay 'Twill be for seeing giants, not for dwarfs. [Haydon stops in his walk and regards Lord Lovel. LADY ETHGROVE. You'll go, I know; come, see him for yourself. Say yes—but “yes”—and straight we will return; Though, 'faith, we've spent the whole long morning there. LOVEL. Excuse me; nothing less than man gigantic! Not an inch less than nine full measured feet Would tempt me to attend. LADY ETHGROVE. Ah, you but jest!— You'll see—you'll change your mind—we go with crowds: Where fashion is, there go the fashionable! And 'tis the fashion to admire Tom Thumb. Adieu! I'm sure you'll go—quite sure you'll go. [Exeunt Lady Ethgrove and Party. LOVEL to HAYDON. You seem annoy'd—yet wherefore thus annoy'd? What need to fret at mere frivolity? If weak, 'tis harmless, and not worth a thought. HAYDON. Not quite so harmless as your lordship deems. This puny prodigy—this wondrous mite— This dwarf—this minikin—this scrap of flesh— This turnip-radish of a man, attracts In myriads, while I gain in units. Last week twelve thousand hurried to the show— One hundred honour'd me with their regard: Twelve thousand to one hundred—desperate odds! LOVEL. Your name and service will survive the time; You are the prophet of a new Art-creed; It taketh years to inculcate the “New”— The “Old” had its believers ere we came, And will have when we're gone. HAYDON. In fact, this world's A riddle, and success an epigram. Forty-two years I've battled for the cause, Through harassments, anxieties, and loss— And what is the result? LOVEL. A great result; and greater yet to come. The Elgin Marbles gave fresh force to Art, And your impassion'd advocacy made Them known and loved, when scorn'd and misconceived. HAYDON. Kindly remark'd, my lord; spoke all like you, My heart—and more, my home—had suffer'd less. LOVEL. The years to come shall pay for sorrows past; Meanwhile, let patience minister to peace! HAYDON. The years to come! I hear the knell of Hope Dolefully ringing 'neath the spectral veil Which hides the future! In my dreams I hear Nothing but dirges. Hope loves youth, not age! LOVEL. Some pulse of Goodness centres in all life; Open the door, and let the Angel enter. HAYDON. Goodness! the revelation of God's love; Yes; I have faith in goodness, though unfound! And equal faith in evil influence! No man more earnestly beseecheth God For strength in weakness, for support in grief, For aid to finish greatly what his mind Greatly conceives, than I. Ere canvas find A line upon its surface, my heart's prayer Ascends to Him who is the help of all! To Him who grasps eternity, and holds All nature in the hollow of His hand. Then in such mood, I feel that I could seize E'en Samson by the throat, and conquer him! Nothing's too vast, too high, too difficult: I walk the level of colossal thought, And mate with heroes in the world of Art. LOVEL. Proceed; I'm all attention. HAYDON. For a time,— This for a time; but other moods take place: The glory narrows to a final speck, And darkness, thick as Erebus, succeeds: Out of this mist of horror comes a breath— A whisper—scarce a voice—a small thin tone That shakes me like a reed, and makes the air Quiver as if with dread. I try to think Of home, of children, all endearing things That gladden labour through the task of life; But still that breath grows hotter in mine ear; The darkness thickens, and an utterance, More dread than any presence man ere saw, Chafes my roused spirit into hate and scorn! Infects me with a pride beyond all pride,— Intense disdain—unequall'd arrogance— Unmatch'd assumption of transcendent powers. Ambition, vast as was the Morning Star's Ere quench'd in night, possesses every nerve. I feel the world would crush me, if it could, But that its malice lacks the needful might: And then I brave the worst it can perform— Mock its opinions—crucify its idols— Unmask its falsehoods, and expose its shams— Counters that would be coins—mere dross for dupes! All tongues against me—I against all tongues! Till life appears a mesh, from which to 'scape Were paradise—and then . . . . I dare not think what then! LOVEL. 'Tis but the penalty of shatter'd nerves— O'erwrought imagination. You need rest, Freedom and relaxation: quit the town, And pass a month with me at Loveltower. Let Nature turn physician, and prescribe As only Nature can, whose power's supreme. HAYDON. There's a prescription every one must take, Sooner or later, and that sombre draught With me seems close at hand—a grave-like phial! LOVEL. Come, come, be glad; discard this monkish mood. Nature's a queen, whom God himself hath crowned: Grace, Beauty, Sweetness, are her maids of honour; They bear her train, rich with the vernal gold And diamonds of the morn; and forth she moves With Pow'r and Grandeur for her ministers: A thousand servants wait upon her steps, And kings are her retainers! Come, we'll change This scene for one of peaceful, woodland life. I'll be the prompter, at whose magic call Prisons are changed to palaces. You'll return Strong to achieve; and Fame will banquet you! HAYDON. Fame is a myth—a ghost that wanders ruins! A phantom that deceives, misleads, and mocks; What sorcery compels me to pursue This vision? LOVEL. Fame is the star of Labour, Without it effort dies—existence pines. Fame, or the hope of Fame, hath led to deeds Which elevate the world,—say nought 'gainst Fame; Fame is to Mind what Love is to the Heart, The goddess of its worship, and its wealth: You have no heresy 'gainst Love, we hope? HAYDON. Love is the law of all things visible; From Love doth emanate the beautiful; And from the god-like beautiful springs Form— Form, the exponent of all majesty! LOVEL. We carry beauty and proportion with us; The visual eye asks guidance from within, And as that cometh is its power increased. Some men see form the first, the colour next: Mere outline hath to them a grander charm Than harmony of tone or grace of hue. Others would sit unquiet if there hung A picture out of square, and forthwith rise, Compell'd by impulse to adjust it right. HAYDON. Taste is the gold of life, where'er 'tis seen, Though but in cottage-home, it lends a light Not wealth itself, if wanting taste, can match. Art, as a teacher and a benefactor, As yet is unacknowledged: give me rule, And Schools of Art I'd raise in every town. LOVEL. You pause. HAYDON. The wheels fast rolling to Tom Thumb! Hear you the inmates hurrying to the scene? They crush—they scream—they faint. Your Lordship finds The number here needs no arithmetic! LOVEL. Methought you had forgotten “such small deer!” HAYDON. Who feels for others can forget no step By which their happiness may be involved: Failure in this neglected exhibition May bring down desolation upon those I'd gladly die to serve. But wherefore grieve? 'Tis but one heartache more! Let me proceed. LOVEL. Schools of Design, you say . . . . HAYDON. Had I the means, Schools of Design I'd build in every town; Make Art an element of education Common to all—the lowliest born of man; A new community should spring around, Refined, improved, advanced in social worth; “Design” ere long would forth reveal itself In every mercantile, industrial craft; Iron and wood, nay, e'en the potter's clay, Would offer forms of elegance and taste. A graceful style adds nothing to the cost; 'Tis odds if more material be not used To mould the vulgar than the graceful form! A saving! there's attraction in the word, Could I but prove this to the Government: What say you? LOVEL. Simply this—petition Peel. HAYDON. I have; and he most courteously declines. Yet Peel means well, and has a heart to feel; Would fain do right, and yet is slow to act. Melbourne but shrugs, and shakes his laughing sides, And says, “What need to paint the House of Lords? Many might say too much Art there already! Schools of Design? What, more designing men? Call you this, Haydon, serving well your country?” So, with a joke, he laughs at argument, And quits the question. LOVEL. We'll not quit it thus; Assistance shall be had, and now, for once, Close doors, and come with me: I have a scheme Perchance may make a fortune; meanwhile, deem My house a debtor by your sojourn there. HAYDON. Had not your lordship better ask Tom Thumb? If he were absent—I might then succeed! LOVEL. The river of success runs ever clear! All flock to see what all can understand. If I read Shakspere, it is plain to sense, I read to what's Shaksperian in the man. If he be wanting in dramatic taste, I might as well harangue the Monument! Come, staying here doth but embitter thought. Nay, cease to hesitate. HAYDON. Embitter thought? Thrice happy they whose expectation's small, And hope but little, if they hope at all! [Exeunt. From T. Taylor's Life of Haydon. “Advertisement.—Haydon's New Pictures.—On Easter Monday next will open for exhibition at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly (admission 1s., catalogues 6d.), two large pictures, viz., ‘The Banishment of Aristides, with his Wife and Children,’ to show the injustice of democracy; ‘Nero Playing with his Lyre while Rome is Burning,’ to prove the heartlessness of despotism. “April 4th.

It is an insanity, a rabies, a madness, a furor, a dream!” LEONARDO DA VINCI. Scene —Gallery of Paintings in the Palace of Fontainebleau; a flight of steps descending to the garden. Enter Raimondi, Filippo, and Ginevra. RAIMONDI. Seven hundred crowns a year! Well, Fortune's son Improves upon his early heritage. FILIPPO. A welcome boon—worthy the generous hand And kingly heart of Francis. A wise gift! RAIMONDI. So after time may say: but hold you not More than a common interest in this act, Knowing Da Vinci long? FILIPPO. From childhood, Sir. I am ten years his senior. Neighbours' sons Were we—wild, rambling, thoughtless, truants oft. Val d'Arno, and the mountain tracts beyond, Beheld us link'd together dawn and eve. Bright days were those, Raimondi; bright but brief— Scenes that have passed to sounds—mere things of air— Voices that have no echo, save a sigh: Little remains to bid us now rejoice. Pleasure finds many doors, and knocks full loud; She hath her youthful comrades as of yore: Age from the casement views her tripping by, Calling no more as erst she used to call; Singing no more as she was wont to sing! RAIMONDI. Well, Leonardo is advancing, too. FILIPPO. Genius counts days by deeds! Him I remember— A handsome, gifted, earnest, active youth: There was persuasion in his honest look; None saw him but to love him. GINEVRA. Love him—a madcap! Sooth, I lov'd him not— A giddy, hare-brained, noisy, reckless lad, Ever in mischief! Never imp alive Contrived to plague me as that rogue Da Vinci. RAIMONDI. I knew him when such school-day sports had ceased, When thought made thin his cheek, when full of hope, Full of the painter's ardour—young and warm, Trembling with aspirations yet untold, He loved to stand and gaze, full hour by hour, Upon a Giotto or a Masaccio:— Hearing no tongue save that which stirr'd the soul With restless promptings unto noble deeds; Seeing a vision canvas never showed Lying beyond, apart, and far above The painted scene on which he seemed to gaze— A world wherein dwelt name, position, fame!— Oh, hope of Genius, how divine the air Which wraps thy presence—how intense the joy That agitates the step that seeks renown! FILIPPO. Gladsome it is to mark a gifted mind Step from a lot, by circumstance confined, Narrowed by poverty, and in pure force Of self-reliant, honourable will Make circumstance give way,—and the steep path Which leads to station, dignity, and power, Take, as 'twere native to the soul within, A spirit born to climb and to ascend! [A pause. Oh! golden city of the land of Hope, What hast thou not in store for those who strive And toil, and mount, and wrestle for the wreathes Whose leaves are— RAIMONDI. What? FILIPPO. Worthless, me thought to say; But I am old, and aged eyes wax dim. RAIMONDI. And yet I've seen them gladden when thou spak'st Of the first painting Leonardo wrought— His famed Medusa . . . . FILIPPO (with excitement). Think, my Raimondi—in a low-built room— On scrap of common wood—with clay and paint, Of which as yet he'd scarcely learnt the use,— Without a friend to cheer, to aid him on, Or whisper courage,—silent and alone, Unfriended, unassisted,—he sent forth A work whose novelty, whose force and depth, Astonished Florence! Then his modest worth; His noble person,—handsome countenance— GINEVRA. A little louder speak,—I'm somewhat deaf. FILIPPO. A handsome lad— GINEVRA. Ay, ay, a franksome lad—a ne'er-do-well; I often said he'd never come to good. Always devising—ever constructing, Making, unmaking;—doing, undoing;— Mills, bridges, boats, and other carpentry— Leaving a litter, which he called “Invention.” Out on Invention!—'tis untidy work— Keeps a house dirty, slovenly and rough . . . . RAIMONDI (interrupting her). You'd need to speak more fittingly of one So high in worth, in honour, as our Painter! GINEVRA. Painter, forsooth!—and where's the good of it? What's the end of it? Who profits by it? Painting? efecks! give me a Pantry, Sir!— Sketching, say you—Kitchen, say I; Kitchen!— The Light of Genius—can you see by it? The Fire of Genius—can you cook with it? What hath his genius done? RAIMONDI. Created works that will outlast thy grave; A plate from one such work were worth a sum. GINEVRA. Plates, marry, plates! give me good dinner plates! Burnished like silver, glittering in a row, Making a dark place light;—Painting! mere stuff! The painting on a clock but spoils the dial; 'Twould better go without it;—Painting! Plates! Leonardo's a fool. [Exit, grumbling. FILIPPO. That woman would speak evil of a saint, As obstinate as . . . . RAIMONDI. What? FILIPPO. An old woman!— RAIMONDI. Mere prejudice, my Filippo, mere cant;— True obstinacy is young as oft as old; As often seen in ringlets as in wigs; As firmly sits upon a snowy brow As though it found ten wrinkles for a seat; Speaks with smooth lip as boldly as with rough; Ascribes a hundred motives for an act, Not one of which is temper, passion, spleen. No 'faith, 'tis “proper pride,”—'tis a “self-respect,”— A rightful spirit suffering things unjust; A brave resolve not to be “trampled on!” Your true-born stubbornness is something great; A mixture of the martyr and the saint!— FILIPPO. The world hath sat in judgment and declared . . RAIMONDI. Tut, tut! The world must then reverse its law. The old? no, no!—the stubborn are the young! Twenty things granted cannot make them grateful; One thing denied sufficeth to provoke them; The young . . It galls me to the quick . . . . FILIPPO. Ha! ha! A Preacher of “submission” losing patience! But of Ginevra, who has just retired, Nothing seems right to her distorted view; Why sent Da Vinci for her? RAIMONDI. Doubtless to render service; place her well; Where her old age might meet with fitting care. E'en I have much to thank his friendship for. No favour promptly offer'd to his youth Escapes his heart—eludes his memory; The hand that did him kindness when a boy— That hand, if needing help, he thrice repays. FILIPPO. God bless him for it! See, Da Vinci comes. RAIMONDI. And with the King. FILIPPO. 'Twere better to retire. RAIMONDI. Two Kings:— One has his throne within this realm of France; The other, crown'd by Fame, ascends a throne Acknowledged by all peoples, and all realms. FILIPPO. Still so enamour'd: one may bend the knee To kingly worth—a thousand unto Kings Without the worth! Still nearer they approach. We may offend. [They descend the steps leading to the garden. Scene II. —Enter Francis the First and Leonardo. LEONARDO. Your Majesty outvalues much my skill. FRANCIS THE FIRST. Nay, good Da Vinci—not a jot too much; Kings find few pleasures half so pure or high As those true Art invites them to partake; 'Tis pleasant to seek refuge from the cares, Inquietudes, and vanities of state, Within a world where talking is unknown:— A world whose star hath set—whose day hath gone; Whose rank and power, whose pomp and arrogance Are painted visions hanging 'gainst a wall!— 'Tis something to behold a human face That asks not office, favour, or control,— Here, conquests, glories, spoils, ambitions, all Shrink into silence;—beauty lifts her gaze, In immortality of loveliness, Yet craves nor title, pension, nor reward: Sworn foes frown face to face, yet draw no sword; The envious cease their scandals; and the false Have done with stratagems and low finesse. Oh, World of Art, thou dost rebuke the life We prize so much, yet pass so peevishly! Say, my Da Vinci, what drew first thy thought Unto this sphere of thy divinity? Art, we remember, was thy second choice. LEONARDO. In youth my great ambition was the Muse;— To leave a poem that might shrine my name For centuries; to represent the mind, The spirit, manners, progress of the Age; To pioneer the path to higher aims And holier aspirations,—to advance The Arts and Science of my country,—these— These were the thoughts that, like unbearing trees, Show'd many leaves, but never came to fruit;— A few light sonnets, a few passing songs, And the strings jarr'd, and all again was mute. FRANCIS. Some sonnets we have seen, yet scarce regret The Poet lost for the true Painter found. LEONARDO. Ah, my liege— Some hundreds enter the wide boat of Fame, But in few years Time throws full many out;— Pass half a century, and half remain;— A hundred years, and you may count their heads By twos and threes—the multitudes are gone: And still the Immortal City shines afar; Still longer centuries must intervene Ere on that coast to Genius consecrate The Pilgrim's name may live for evermore, Writ high above the casualties of time!— Such height, I fear, my name may never reach. FRANCIS. Great men know not their greatness—'tis the air, The daily element, which they respire; Greatness is habitude, and strikes them not! LEONARDO. My next ambition was to cope with Time;— Anticipate the future, and invent Machines that should achieve what human hands, By tens of thousands, could not execute; To bring the poor cheap bread, and better garb, Healthier homes, and life at lesser cost; And partly 'twas accomplish'd;—my next step,— FRANCIS. And best— LEONARDO. Would I could think so; but, my liege, What yet is done seems small to the “to be”— That grows, enlarges—but 'tis ever so: The prize of time is in the years to come, The time we have we prize not!— FRANCIS. Say not so! One work is done which every heart must prize! Art is the bridge that leads from years of time To the eternal years whose sun is Fame! To speak not of the female heads thy skill Hath dower'd with beauty and perpetual grace, Whose tender playfulness, expression, power; Whose purity, refinement, breathe a life— A stamp of truth, unequall'd erst in Art,— Omitting these, one great achievement stands To guard thy name from man's forgetfulness— One noble labour—“The Lord's Supper!” whence, Whence rose the seed of this? A sudden thought, Or long premeditation? LEONARDO. Good, my liege, The painting honour'd with such special praise Was my sole thought for years:—full oft the hope Of its accomplishment died in my breast, Again to be renew'd—with higher zeal And bolder impulse; then again delay'd. The day my hand, irresolute and slow, Dared the commencement of so grand a theme, A solemn sense of some companionship Compell'd my pencil silently to paint;— Fused feeling into colours;—soon this pass'd, And my whole being own'd some presence gone. Still day by day, week, month, and year, I strove; Onward, though slow, till each Disciple's head Before my mind, as in a mirror, came, And lived upon the canvas as they rose; When each received my last, half-lingering touch, I turned to that, which made reflection ache, To that—the one untouched—all else complete:— The head of our Redeemer—the Divine, Incarnate Saviour,—Ransom infinite! How dared I execute those lineaments? With what expression might I mould that face— That head, which God himself had glorified— That hand which angels worshipp'd in their spheres: That hand!—Oh, miracle of gracious love,— Which gave itself to wounds, our souls to heal, And lift them pure before the face of God? I paused and wept:—what could I else but weep? What other offering had my soul to yield For such self-sacrifice—such love supreme? [A pause. FRANCIS. Emotion is the spring of excellence; He must feel deeply who'd make others feel. LEONARDO. Oh! my mind long'd—yet fear'd the wondrous theme— To mark each scene and circumstance that left A glory round Jerusalem—that endow'd The everlasting tongue of love with truth, That lifted man to an inheritance Surpassing earthly kingdoms—made the grave A gateway unto light!—a path o'er which Shone the unsetting day of righteousness! To portray Him who trod the wilderness And held communion with eternity:— He who loved Martha, Mary, Lazarus;— Who on his breast received the slumb'ring brow Of his disciple John;—whose tenderness Broke forth in syllables that live insphered;— Who to the universal Mother called, With voice that thrills each matron-heart e'en now, “Suffer little children to come unto Me!” Oh, lips Divine—oh, words omnipotent, Solace unmatch'd, and comfort unconceived— How could man's pencil seek to realise An image that could live—resembling Thee? But I forget the presence of my King,— FRANCIS. Thy King would have thee still forget; Proceed. LEONARDO. Then pass'd a vision, or perchance a dream, I know not what, but vision it appear'd! In which I seem'd spectator, and not actor:— Coming and going without thought of mine— A vision that surprised me unto tears!— As music to the ear—so to my soul Rang the innumerable harmonies Of heaven, of angels, and the hosts of God! FRANCIS. We have felt painting thus ourself, Da Vinci, As voiceless sermons—silent psalms to God— Mute and yet eloquent:—they bade us feel What words were powerless to communicate. Enter Officer. FRANCIS. What interruption now? Who waits without? OFFICER. My liege, the deputies of Burgundy Entreat an audience . . . . FRANCIS (aside). What broil's abroad? What fresh chagrin, vexation, discontent, Trouble our deputies? Well, 'tis some gain To snatch an interval, though brief as this, From frets of rule and jealousies of state. The State is King, and sovereigns are its slaves. (To Da Vinci.) You to your canvas—we to council go. Happier your realm than any realm we know. GIULIO ROMANO. Scene—Giulio in the Hall of Constantine, steadfastly regarding Raffaelle's picture of “Justice and Mercy.” To him enter Donatini and Francesco. GIULIO. Now, Donatini, what's the latest news? DONATINI. Cardinal Tortoso has been chosen Pope, And with new title fills the papal chair. GIULIO. Adrian the Sixth—the news is six hours old! DONATINI. Adrian the Sixth—and further, in your ear Let it be whisper'd,—Angelo's recall'd! GIULIO. Recall'd! That's news, and welcome news to Art. DONATINI. You fear no rival, Raffaelle being dead: Others, less lib'ral, perchance had thought Bad news, and most unwelcome. GIULIO. Rival, no! Art hath no rival, save unrivall'd Nature: Each gifted mind is a new strength to Art; New wealth, new capital; and weak is he Who dreads a brother greater than himself. He knows not Art, nor Art's exalted aim. FRANCESCO. What is the aim of Art? GIULIO. It is to teach Through power of beauty the eternal power! It is to feel our own humanity Enlarge with Science, to evolve out of The perishable the imperishable! 'Tis to give feature to imagination, Set clear the visionary forms of fancy, Make shadows real, hold the fleeting fast! To snatch the spark that can illuminate. FRANCESCO. By this we must conceive you designate The highest order of Inventive Art;— Nature hath other schools and colleges, Other degrees and honours.—Is't not so? GIULIO. Reigns, customs, manners change, but not so man: The spirit of the old humanity Invigorates the new; Man changes more In symbol than in essence;—and the thoughts That thrill'd Apelles in long ages back Thrill Grecian breasts e'en now; and to the end The grandeur and the majesty of Art Shall wake grand thoughts, and Truth and Justice Keep their primal state and regal dignity. FRANCESCO. To follow up this subject. It would seem Art, in its highest form, hath province here But second to religion—that is, to raise And spiritualise our nature!—thus— GIULIO. Time hath made pictures altars! they've received The homage vouchsafed to divinity: It is the soul's prerogative to soar! An impulse God implanted from the first, When he created man: as it is nature In the earth to feel the influence of spring, So is it nature in the soul to feel The influence of Art. DONATINI. Thought all like you It might be well. GIULIO. Who's the true patriot, He who sets himself above his country, Or he who, for that country's sake, would see Self, power, possession—everything—forgot; And, scorning death, with his last effort cry, Make way for Rome, ye nations?—so with Art. DONATINI. Give me your hand—right nobly said, Romano. Less self, less thought of self, less show of self, More thought of that which teaches love of all; More love of that which teaches thought for all. GIULIO. Ah! who so just, unenvious; who so kind As noble Raffaelle? Oft I've heard him say, “Thank God I breathe the air of Angelo!” And Angelo, whene'er he visits Rome, Will see no spot more precious to his thought, More touching to his heart, than the dear earth Which wraps the form of Santi Raffaelle. FRANCESCO. From what dire circumstance arose the fact That Michael, that great mark and pride of Rome, Was forced to visit Pietra? 'Twas most strange! GIULIO. Leo the Tenth, whose brief pontificate Made a new era in the world of Art, On his accession to the papal throne Profess'd regard for Michael Angelo; Love for his fame, and zeal for his success; Desired his genius for his native city; And Angelo, as if foreboding ill, Reluctantly obey'd the Pontiff's call. FRANCESCO. 'Tis true; but thence to Florence order'd, forth To build, of Saint Lorenzo, the façade. GIULIO. What follow'd next? 'Tis known throughout the realm, Instead of the façade—unfinish'd yet Since the old Cosmo time—instead of this, Great work and fit for Genius to perform, He, Michael Angelo, the soul of Art, Was straight dismiss'd to Pietra, to decide Between the quarries of the mountains there And the pure marble of Carrara—thus For eight long toilsome years he fashion'd blocks, Constructed roads o'er marshes to the sea, Travell'd with rafts and fascines! Believ'st thou? He—Rome's great architect and ornament, True Painter, Poet, Sculptor—left to toil Like common mason—a mere blank in life; His time consumed—his glorious talents lost During the whole, hard reign of Leo Tenth? DONATINI. It mocks belief!—myriads, as yet unborn, Will read, yet doubt; and ask, can this be true Which wars 'gainst sense? GIULIO. You saw me gazing here On Justice and on Mercy!—shadows both: They have no living semblances on earth! To think of eight years in such labour spent! DONATINI. A loss no Pope of Rome may e'er compute: A loss posterity will long deplore! GIULIO. Years, generations, empires and their crowns, Follow each other to the end of time: All things of earth are reproduced by earth; Genius hath no successor!—knows no heir!— Angelo dead—what centuries could replace The grand old spirit of that master-mind? Angelo living—any puny power May cramp and fetter. Rome! it makes me mad To think of Michael and Pietra Santé. DONATINI. Go where ye will, this is the fate of Genius! Ever the stream of life is full of turns And rough impediments; to chafe at fate Is but to sink the deeper. GIULIO. Sad as true, The path of fame finds many a weary foot, And aching head, and disappointed heart; Many ascend, few reach the toilsome height! DONATINI. Whate'er the Present owes the Future pays! Towards the Pantheon let us hasten now. GIULIO. First meet we Angelo—conduct him there; There, 'neath its cupola, survey the tomb Of Raffaelle:—let Genius mourn for Genius; A tear from Michael Angelo would soothe That spirit, call'd too early from the world, Too early from that sphere which he adorn'd. DONATINI. Too early, yes; too soon for Art! and yet That is not Death which brings not death to fame: He lives, who leaveth an immortal name. [Exeunt. SONGS AND POEMS. THE CHAPEL-BELL. The wintry winds blow wild and shrill, Like ghosts they shriek across the moor, Or howl beneath the window sill, Or shake with gusty hands the door; And, hour by hour, from some lone bell A wizard sound at night doth steal— Sometimes 'tis like a funeral knell, Sometimes 'tis like a marriage peal! I know it is some fiend that stands Within the belfry's ghastly gloom, And with its stark and fleshless hands Rings out dead souls from tomb to tomb. I long to weep—I pray to sleep, But through the haunted house it sounds, And through my flesh the chill veins creep Like wintry worms in burial-grounds. A weight is on my heart—my brain, A shadow flits across the floor; And then I know it is in vain To pine, or pray, or struggle more! Well, let the foul fiend ring till morn— Till the red sun awakens men: Yet, though thus tortured and forlorn, What then I did—I'd do again! He thought it fine to feign a love Which woo'd my spirit to his feet; He raised his false, false eyes above, And vow'd, what's useless to repeat. Whate'er he vow'd, there is no name So black on earth as his deceit; Whate'er he vow'd, there is no shame So vile as in his heart did beat! Ring out, thou bitter fiend, till morn Awakes the prying eyes of men; Yet prison'd, madden'd, and forlorn, What then I did—I'd do again! Not slightly was I woo'd or won; For years the whisp'ring false one came, And nought a saint might fear to shun Forewarn'd me of the villain's aim. I loved him—loved? I would have died, If dying ought to him might spare; I would have every pain defied To save him from a single care! Toll, toll, thou fiend, ring out, and tell The murd'rous deed from goal to goal! I know my name is writ in hell— I feel there's blood upon my soul! The dawn arose, but not for me The bridal train did wait and smile; As slowly, stately, three by three, They swept in beauty down the aisle. I crept behind the pillar'd base; The bride's white garments fann'd my cheek; The blood rush'd madly to my face; I dared not breathe—I could not speak! Laugh out, thou fiend, laugh out and scorn, With mocking sounds, my weary ear! Is there no other—lost—forlorn, No other wretch whose life's a tear? There rose a whisper deep and low— A sound that took away my sight; All things around me seem'd to flow, And wander in a demon light! I nerved my hand to grasp the steel; I stepp'd between him and his bride. Who'd think so black a heart could feel?— Could pour so warm, so red a tide? Is there no sinful soul but mine, Thou endless fiend, that thou must make These serpent sounds to hiss and twine Around me till my senses ache! I had not stabb'd him, but I saw My noble father's thin gray hairs; And that, perchance, which tears might draw, Drew blood upon me unawares. I flung the shrieking bride apart; I sprang before him in his guilt; The steel went quivering to his heart— Would God my own blood had been spilt! Laugh out, dark fiend! beside me then A wilder sound than thine was spread; A cry I ne'er shall hear again Till every grave gives up its dead! Twelve months—dark months—I groan'd in pain A curse lay heavy on my head. They tell me I have ne'er been sane Since that wild hour the bridegroom bled! They say no shadow stalks the room— No midnight tolling haunts the air. 'Tis false! You hear it through the gloom; And, see, the phantom passes—there! Mad—mad? 'Twere blissful but to lose One hour from self—one moment free From thoughts that every hope refuse— From life whose lot is misery! Mad—mad? As if the sense could leave The form it tortured! Never more Shall I do aught but rave and grieve, And wish—vain wish—this life were o'er! Away!—a thousand lives have gone, A thousand phantoms glide in hell; But not one perish'd—no, not one So black in guilt as he who fell! Night after night, 'mid sounds aghast, That fiend, that spectre, haunts my way. What shall I see when life hath past, And Night is mine that knows no day? ENDURANCE. I Ever struggle and endurance: “Is there no repose?” I cried; Gives the world but this assurance,— Others thus have lived and died? II On the broad highway of being Crowds on crowds still ever go; Nothing more beyond them seeing Than to toil with foreheads low. III To a spot I wander'd dreary, With thick branches overlaid, For the sunlight made me weary— There seem'd solace in the shade. IV On a bank my limbs reposing, Found a momentary balm; Spirit worn, my eyelids closing, Sought forgetfulness and calm. V Still that thought, for ever present, Came with purpose unexprest; As beneath the moon's dim crescent Glides some ghost that cannot rest. VI Seeking hint or clue to guide me, As I leant upon the earth, I beheld a flower beside me Struggling, midst the soil, to birth. VII Through the winter's wrath and rigour, Pent in dust, and prison'd fast, Had it forced its path with vigour, Till obstruction ceased at last! VIII Now within its emerald bosom All the future life reposed— Swell'd the rich and golden blossom That the morn would see unclosed. IX Then my heart, with sudden motion, Lost the weight so hard to bear; And some new and sweet devotion Soothed and sanctified its care. X He who thus the flower hath moulded, Sphered its being to this span; He, too, hath the future folded In the living soul of man! XI For a time the soil is round us, For a time we feel the thorn; When the spirit-hour hath found us, Inner glories shall be born! XII Welcome struggle and endurance— Welcome toil, to this allied; Welcome the divine assurance,— Others thus have lived and died! XIII Toil, I kiss thee with affection, Never more shall mortal say That I view thee with dejection— That I murmur on my way. XIV Through the soil and earthy ember, He who raised the flower from dust— He will also man remember; And in Him I move and trust? YEARS TO COME. I A day will dawn I ne'er shall see; A night will set I ne'er shall know; The wave-tide of humanity Thus ever surges to and fro. II The dew with gems shall bead the flower, The bird make rich the morn with song; And Mind, still climbing hour by hour, Find worlds beyond the starry throng. III Years shall return to future years What ages unto them have given, And that high power which Faith reveals, Grasp the fixed points of earth and Heaven. IV The boy shall loiter through the lane, With school-ward footsteps short and slow; Afraid each moment to remain, And yet still more afraid to go! V Ah, priceless years! if boyhood knew The mark and value of such time; Ah, happy school! could youth but view The future and its paths sublime. VI What younger Howard then might feel— What other Wilberforce arise— What Burke assert the general weal— What Rosse or Newton span the skies!— VII The joys, the hopes, the interests, That animate the bosom now, Shall lend their glow to other breasts— And flush the young enthusiast brow. VIII The majesty of manhood then May aim at some diviner worth; And progress grant to future men A wider brotherhood on earth. IX What theory shall then succeed? What deeper power—what newer theme— What fresh discovery supersede The electric flash—the steed of steam? X Who'll be the bard to England dear, When centuries have filed and fled? Or who the statesmen crowds will cheer, Worthy the Peels or Chathams dead? XI The passions that distract mankind— The pride, the envy, and mistrust— Shall they be scatter'd on the wind That lifts the banner of the just? XII Shall Christian sense e'er sheathe the sword? Shall simple Justice rule the land? Shall Law its shield of right afford, A right that all may understand? XIII The languid sun fades in the sky; The sap within the tree droops low; The cold wind whispers winter nigh, And soon the last lorn leaf must go! XIV Yet he who in all change can find A providence of goodness shown— He who is ruler o'er his mind Is more than he who rules a throne. XV A day shall come I ne'er shall see, A day when heart and tongue lie dumb; That day, O Lord, be Thou with me— And oh, on earth, Thy kingdom come! “NIGHT” AND “MORNING.” [The title of “Night” and “Morning” is given to two excellent paintings by Sir Edwin Landseer. Few of the fine works, even of this our modern master, demand greater attention. The subject is simple in both pictures. In the first we perceive a couple of deer contending for the mastery, on an elevated piece of moorland adjoining a lake; the moon has risen above the distant hills which form the horizon. “Morning” shows to us the result of the combat—the animals are dead.] Afar o'er the mountains the mists are unroll'd, And the wings of the Morn scatter crimson and gold; The voice of the torrent is heard on its way Proclaiming the power and the glory of day; While each object the soul with magnificence fills, And the heart seems to echo the joy of the hills. What cry comes so swift from the solitude vast? What feet sweep the glen like the rush of the blast? 'Tis the stag of the desert—the monarch whose throne Is girt with a grandeur to cities unknown; He was up with the dawn, over heather and fen— Over corrie and cairn—over moorland and glen; From bold Ben-y-chatt to Loch Dirie he flew, Nor stayed he his hoof at Glenbruar nor Chroo; With the foam-speed of passion he bated no breath, But away—still away—to the combat of death! Where shrieks the lone eagle, where skulks the lean fox, And the wolf holds her watch from her home mid the rocks; Where the spray of the torrent is hung like a shroud, And the pine soars aloft through the rack of the cloud; Still onward he rushes, still bounds at a pass, Each rugged and stern and precipitous mass; Up, upward, he toils, by no danger deterr'd, 'Till his rival appears in the midst of the herd! One glance—and together they spring o'er the path— One moment, each eye-ball is gleaming with wrath; Now butting, now goring—their haunches they bow; Now tossing in fury, clash antler and brow; 'Till the fire of their passion falls faint by degrees, And panting and foaming they sink to their knees; Still horn linked in horn, still contending with fate, While the moonlight looks down on their fury and hate! But the moonlight hath gone; and the Morning hath thrown Over mountain and river a spell of her own:— A freshness that sparkles with heavenly light, A beauty that glorifies hollow and height: The gold of the summits is tinctured with rose, And the air with a gladness and holiness glows; Above—springs enchantment in every breath, Below—there's the rock—and the vulture—and death. Who recks what that Night of contention hath seen? Who recks what the rage of the rivals hath been? As, hour after hour, gash'd and gory they stood, From the fetlock to neck plash'd with foam and with blood, With antlers so lock'd, that no strength could unclose The clasp that in life they had fasten'd as foes! Now the fox to his banquet in silence may prowl, And the wild eagle shriek to the wolf's hungry howl. THE BEST ESTATE. The Heart it hath its own estate— The Mind it hath its wealth untold; It needs not fortune to be great, While there's a coin surpassing gold. No matter which way Fortune leans, Wealth makes not Happiness secure; A little mind hath little means— A narrow heart is always poor. Stern Fate the greatest still enthrals, And Misery hath its high compeers; For Sorrow enters palace halls, And queens are not exempt from tears. The princely robe and beggar's coat, The scythe and sword, the plume and plough, Are in the grave of equal note,— Men live but in the eternal “Now!” Still Disappointment tracks the proud— The bravest 'neath defeat may fall; The high, the rich, the courtly crowd Find there's calamity for all. 'Tis not the house that honour makes,— True honour is a thing divine; It is the mind precedence takes,— It is the spirit makes the shrine! So keep thou yet a generous heart, A steadfast and contented mind; And not, till death, consent to part With that which friend to friend doth bind. What's utter'd from the life within Is heard not by the life without; There's always something to begin 'Twixt life in faith, and life in doubt! But grasp thou Truth—though bleak appears The rugged path her steps have trod— She'll be thy friend in other spheres; Companion in the world of God. Thus dwelling with the wise and good— The rich in thought, the great in soul— Man's mission may be understood, And part prove equal to the whole! We know not half we may possess, Nor what awaits, nor what attends,— We're richer far than we may guess, Rich as Eternity extends! The Heart it hath its own estate, The Mind it hath its wealth untold; It needs not fortune to be great, While there's a coin surpassing gold! IN MEMORIAM. Day after day, the angels say, Innumerable souls ascend; Day after day, we mourn and pray For some departed friend; Yet never kinder heart than thine, And never truer breast E'er soar'd unto a world divine, Or won immortal rest. O school-companion, playmate, friend! I muse the long years o'er, And weep to see the shroud descend Which folds thee evermore: I shrink to yield thee to the dust— To mark the funeral pall; And strive to teach my heart to trust In Him who feels for all! And can it be that thou art dead, And I left to deplore? I almost seem to list thy tread— To hear thee at the door: The path, it was thy wont to cross, I gaze upon, and wait; And scarce can realise my loss,— A loss so deep—so great! Our school-days seem to dawn again; Again the same light beams; A different light than falls on men, A radiance full of dreams. The future—what it was to be! When all our hopes seem'd truth; Alas, the things we live to see Are not the dreams of youth! Is there a childhood in that sphere To which thy soul hath fled? Do we begin the spirit-year, New-born from out the dead? Tread we eternity at first, As we trod time of yore? Or, does immortal glory burst At once from God's own shore? O gate of death! O gate of life! O mystery sublime! With everlasting wonders rife, And marvels of all time;— Say, shall affections still remain? Shall memories endure? And links of friendship's endless chain Eternity secure? Shall truth find truth, and love find love, Within that better world? Shall all the tears and pains we prove Be ever earthward hurl'd? Shall friend meet friend in that blest hour, Before their Saviour's sight, And feel that Death no more hath power To separate or blight? My heart hath faith—my soul hath hope, Once more to see thy face; A few brief years with time to cope, Then newer worlds to trace! A few brief years on earth to roam, And then, when death is o'er, Angels for friends—and Heaven for home— And love for evermore! THE WANDERER. Three dreary years in peril tost— Three years upon a polar sea: Ice-wreck'd,—and half his comrades lost; Once more his native land treads he. While westward from the sandy height He views where, far, his cottage lies, A father's transport fills his sight, A husband's joy o'erflows his eyes! He speeds by each remember'd way, Each turning brings him still more near; He sees his first-born child at play— And calls—but cannot make him hear Fast as he speeds his child appears Still distant as it was before; At length, with bursting, grateful tears, He sees his young wife at the door. She takes the sweet child by the hand, She kisses him with loving joy; The gazer deems in all the land There's no such other wife or boy! She lifts him fondly to her cheek, Then leaves the narrow wicket gate; The Wanderer thinks he will not speak, But gaze and wait—if love can wait! But from that gate, to open view, Come never more those feet so light; There grew no covert, that he knew, Whose leaves might hide them from his sight. A sudden terror fills his veins And chills the rapture in his eyes; With eager spring the gate he gains; And calls, but not a voice replies. The door—it does not stand ajar— The casement, too, is closed and dark; Across the path is thrown a bar— And all wears desolation's mark! He shrieks in fear each name so dear— The garden plot is waste and wild; O God! why doth his wife not hear? O love! why cometh not his child? He strains to catch the slightest trace Of form or raiment; nought is seen; As, with a wild and spectral face, The gray boughs groan and intervene! The leaves bend trembling to their root, The frail grass mutters to the flower; With ghost-like wing the long rays shoot, While tolls the bell the vesper hour. He turns bewilder'd at the sound— Again his wife, his child, appear; They move across the churchyard ground, And beckon the pale Wanderer near. A few steps more and he may hold The twain within his trembling arms: Why seems his sinking heart so cold? What shakes him with these dread alarms? Pale, in the dreary moonlight, gleams Each mound and monumental stone; He stands distraught—as one that dreams— Was he again alone—alone? Alone—they've pass'd—yet nothing stirr'd! He thought that thro' the spectral air There rose one low, one little word, Faint echo of some infant prayer! He thought that name, which erst had mov'd His pulses with a parent's joy, Came softly—as in hours beloved— When on his glad knee sat his boy! Yet all had fled: and on the stone Beneath his feet two lines were read; Sad lines, that to the eyes once shown, Do break the heart; that's better dead! He press'd his hot lips to each name— He kiss'd each letter o'er and o'er— They scorch'd his sight, as if with flame; They sear'd his worn heart to the core. For this—he cried—for this was won My way thro' tempests!—this—to bear; Still—still, O God—Thy will be done! Yet one—not one! not one to spare! Morn stepp'd from out the mists of heaven, And coldly lit each hallow'd spot; Another morn to him was given— Another world, where death was not! A DAILY SCENE. A dim light in the window, Deep straw around the gate, And silence lingering as in pain Some closing breath to wait. Is it a mother that departs? A sire, whose course is o'er? A child, mid tears and breaking hearts, That speeds to death's mute shore? Doth friend lose friend? Some comrade old That early boyhood knew— When like a lamb from Nature's fold Life drank the morning dew. We know not. This alone we know; There is no home but tells Some sorrow in this world below Of graves and funeral bells. Some flower beloved that bloomed in vain, Some joy that could not last; Some hope that darken'd into pain; Some grief that shrouds the past. Another sun hath bathed the lawn In light, and golden air; The dead hath found another dawn, A dawn which angels share. Around the house a sadness steals, A weight that pains the brow; There is no fear of rolling wheels; No need of caution now. No need of blind-drawn windows, Nor deep straw, borne aside, To tell us in that darken'd home Some heart hath loved and died. THE VICAR'S BLIND DAUGHTER. Lone, yet never feeling lonely, For her spirit peace can win; Blind she is, but darkness only Dwells without, and not within. Face of friend or brother never Lent their image to her eyes; Yet the world seems kindly ever, And its love wears no disguise! Let us sit awhile beside her— Watch her life a single day; See the angel that doth guide her Gently through her darken'd way: Nature hath but one concealment— All that eloquence can yield Meets her soul in rich revealment; Voice of stream, and wood, and field! E'en the Summer flowers, though lowly, Gather their whole heart's perfume With a sweetness still more holy, As to sanctify her gloom. Charm of hue they cannot send her; Yet her gentle touch they meet With a softness far more tender, And a sweetness still more sweet. Not a rustic in the village, Not a ploughman labouring nigh, But, forgetting toil and tillage, Blesses her as she goes by: She knows all the children's voices, Calls their young names o'er and o'er; Every mother's heart rejoices As she standeth by the door. For she feeleth for their sorrow, Careth for them in their care; Helpeth them to meet the morrow With the little she's to spare. In their sickness she is near them, In each trial of their lot She is first to aid and cheer them; None in sorrow are forgot! So she fills her daily mission With unwearied heart and mind, Helping all in hard condition, Leaving sorrow more resign'd! So each night, by angels tended, Finds she Nature's rest increase; And that days in duty ended Bring the spirit perfect peace. Call you life like this privation? Hath not God's own word supplied, Ev'n in darkness, consolation— Joys, through Jesus, multiplied? Light, which earthly vision never Yet beheld on sea or shore, Hopes, no darkness can dissever, Lift her soul for evermore! CRADLE SONG. Near a chin, like bank of snow, Dwells a lip where kisses grow; Eyes, where little angels dwell, Each within its azure cell; Tiny dimples in each cheek Seem, in Fancy's ear, to speak: So, at least, the mother sings— Wond'ring babies have not wings! Strange what mothers can believe; Strange how human eyes deceive: Nothing seem'd, as I stood by, More than right in chin and eye. As for infant lips, we know Where they come, there kisses grow! But young mothers think such things— Fancy, babies born with wings! THE WOODLAND WAY. “Still day by day the woodland way, I wonder you're not weary, Jane.” “I go to hear the woodlark, dear, And list the linnet's merry strain.” “The lark soars in the sun's warm ray, The linnet's heard in every lane; But day by day the woodland way! There's sure some other reason, Jane?” Jane turned aside with wounded pride, And left her friend without a look; She knew each turn by moss and fern, Each narrow winding of the brook: But still a voice within would say, A conscience-voice, that whisper'd plain, “Still day by day the woodland way! There's sure some other reason, Jane?” Still through the glade, in light and shade, She wander'd far, until she found An aged thorn,—where time had worn Deep rents and hollows near the ground: There, soft and white, just hid from sight, A small seal'd note her fingers gain: Ah, never bird, that love e'er heard, Had note so sweet, so dear, to Jane! NOT MY OWN. I told my lips they must disguise The secret of my soul; But oh, my heart flew to my eyes, And told almost the whole! Oh, eyes too swift of love to speak, No more such thoughts reveal! 'Twas vain: Love next upon my cheek Wrote all I would conceal! And thus, by every glance betray'd, My hidden love made known, I'm of my very heart afraid, For it seems not my own! FREAKS OF FATE. Things congenial lose each other, Life and love are incomplete; Hearts akin to one another Rarely are the hearts to meet! Where's the reason? Tell me whether 'Tis Fate's star that thus decides; That brings opposites together, And the similar divides! Spirits suited lose each other; Time is but a long deceit; Hearts akin to one another Rarely are the hearts to meet. Fortune seems to make alliance Where conformity rebels; As in Nature's plain defiance, Matching where no fitness dwells! What is this which chains existence To an uncongenial state? Should the soul not make resistance 'Gainst this tyranny of fate? Spirits suited lose each other, Life and love are incomplete; Hearts akin to one another Rarely are the hearts to meet. WATCHING AND WAITING. Ever weeping at the casement, Ever looking, leaning out; While the village, in amazement, Wonder what this grief's about! With the morn-light, gray and dreary, Long ere waketh bird or bee, Mary stands, with spirit weary, Gazing out upon the sea. There, until the west sun gloweth, Lists she to each breeze that blows; But the wind, though much it knoweth, Telleth no one what it knows,— No one—no one—what it knows. On a coast forlorn, forsaken, Dug by hard and hasty hands, Near a low cross, rudely shapen, Rests a grave upon the sands! Never wing of bird comes near it, Nothing but the billows' roar; And a voice—the night stars hear it— Sighing, “Mary, never more!” Still, until the west sun gloweth, Mary lists each breeze that blows; But the wind, though much it knoweth, Telleth no one what it knows,— No one—no one—what it knows. PAN'S DEW-DROP. PAN. Hither, Sylphs and Satyrs, hither! Here's a secret going to wither: Stand around and answer true,— Is't a gem or drop of dew? Is its birthplace high or low,— Sky or ocean? Ho—ho—ho! Ho—ho—ho! Guess and tell me ere it go! SYLPHS. 'Tis a tear from Luna's eye; 'Tis a star from some lost sky; 'Tis a fairy pearl—a thing Fallen from Titania's ring! 'Tis a gem from Cupid's bow. PAN. Cupid! Cupid! Ho—ho—ho! Ho—ho—ho! Cupid leaves no jewels so. SYLPHS. 'Tis a spangle from the shoe Which Queen Mab at Somnus threw; 'Tis a spark of Terra's spar! Silver stud from Juno's car! 'Tis a rare and tiny shell Gather'd from some Mermaid's cell! PAN. Mermaid! Juno! Ho—ho—ho! Ho—ho—ho! 'Tis but dew that's frozen so. SYLPHS. Who knows what it may conceal? Atoms can great truths reveal! Is't a glowworm, fast asleep, Caught and spell-bound ere't could creep? Is't an egg some insect knew? PAN. Nothing else but frozen dew! A bud! a berry! Guess who can:— 'Tis frozen dew, or I'm not Pan! SYLPHS. Winter ne'er such gem could show: 'Tis pearl! PAN. It is not! Ho—ho—ho! Ho—ho—ho! Here's a coil 'bout frost and snow! BE SURE YOU CALL. It was a rustic cottage gate, And over it a maiden leant, Upon her face and youthful grace A lover's earnest eyes were bent. “Good-night,” she said, “once more, good-night, The evening star is rising high; But early with the morning light Be sure you call as you pass by, As you pass by, Be sure you call as you pass by.” The spring had into summer leapt, Brown autumn's hand her treasures threw, When forth a merry party swept In bridal garments, two by two; I saw it was the maid that bless'd The evening star that rose so high:— For he, as I suppose you've guess'd, Had often call'd as he pass'd by, As he pass'd by, Had often call'd as he pass'd by. Oh, blissful lot, where all's forgot, Save love, that wreathes the heart with flowers! Oh, what's a throne to that dear cot Whose only wealth is happy hours? And oft, if o'er the woodland way The evening star is rising high, I fancy still I hear her say, “Be sure you call as you pass by, As you pass by, Be sure you call as you pass by.” FALSE AS WATER. Flow on, thou faithless stream, That maketh all things seem As deep within thy heart: Fern, bell, and drooping tree, Behold themselves in thee; And yet thou canst depart. Alas! thy little span But mimics faithless man! Like thee, too, he can stray; Like thee a charm reveal— Reflect, but never feel— And singing pass away. Flow on! thou canst not touch The wounded heart so much As man's inconstant breath; Thy false tongue ne'er deceives Like his, who loves, and leaves; Takes life, and brings us death! What though within thy face Our very looks we trace; Thy falsehood's not so deep As his whose lips can sigh, Yet leave the heart to die,— And, till it dies, to weep! LOVERS' WALKS. Ah! once I liked not lovers' walks, Nor wanderings by the hill, When star to star at midnight talks, And all the world is still: I laugh'd at all romantic souls, That half in rapture stood; I hated strolls—those moonlight strolls— And always thought I should! I vow'd by all the world e'er knew Of beautiful or bright, No love on earth should tempt me to A rambling walk by night; But, ah! one's mind can little guess To what one's heart is born! Who'd thought a month, or even less, Had found me so forsworn? But when I loved nor star, nor moon, Nor wanderings through the glen, My song of life was out of tune, I knew not Mary then: Now, I would rather roam till light Bloom'd o'er the Morn's sweet breast, Than ever breathe those words, “Good Night!” Or ever think of rest. PLAIN FACES. Neither feature nor complexion Can the law of liking prove; We see all things through affection— All is lovely seen through love! How we love, or what attraction Wins us, who hath power to learn! Beauty, 'tis our satisfaction, Love can this in all discern! Plainer faces win election, Plainer forms to passion move; Joy, that through the heart's affection, Beauty lives in all we love! NEVERMORE. Whither, spirit, whither? Let me weep alone: Wherefore bring me hither, Knowing she is gone? All that was Elysian With herself hath flown; Tears are in the vision Of that shrine o'erthrown. Do the roses whisper Sweet, as she were nigh? Do the linnets warble Music, like her sigh? Neither rose nor linnet Can the charm restore; Life hath but one language, One sad word—“Deplore!” Just as he that dreameth Starts, and wakes in tears, So the present seemeth Girt with doubts and fears: Still, 'mid hopes that wither, Sorrow liveth on: Wherefore bring me hither, Knowing she is gone? DID YOU KNOW HER? Did you know her?—any station Might become her—high or low; She was fond of admiration, Few the arts she did not know: She could droop her eyes, as dreaming, With a tender, quiet grace; Then, with sudden, upward beaming, Flash their lustre on your face! Did you know her? She was never Fond of saying what she meant;— You'd confess her words were clever, But a riddle their intent: She'd a puzzle of expression, Half of nature, half of art; And a perfect self-possession, Visible in every part. Free and graceful in the morning, Pensive in the afternoon; Changing moods without a warning— Weeping now—yet laughing soon: Various as the moments show her, Still, each moment finds a charm; And, indeed, if you should know her— Guard your heart—if it be warm! NEVER FOUND. There's an image we enshrine In the heart's young days; A form we deem divine In the heart's young days; But that fancy of the mind, We may seek—but never find: 'Tis a dream we leave behind With our heart's young days. But who can dreams control In their heart's young days? They're the shadows of the soul, In our heart's young days: And, though the living grace May escape from our embrace, Yet sweet's the vision'd face Of our heart's young days! 'Tis the purity that waits On our heart's young days; That such loveliness creates In our heart's young days: The angel, that we drew, Remain'd while life was new; Then back to heaven flew With our heart's young days! SMALL GIFTS. I care not how simple The offering may be, If it come from the heart It is welcome to me: 'Tis not in itself That the value resides; The jewel is love— Worth all jewels besides. Affection is something Beyond what is bought: 'Tis the growth of the heart— 'Tis the wealth of the thought! And often we find, 'Mid the gifts of the earth, The smallest in value Is greatest in worth! LYRIC. [There's a spirit of fancy flowing—] There's a spirit of fancy flowing— Flowing in dreams of night; Sweeping the shores of darkness, Yet bearing an angel's light. Restless—questioning ever— Reaping the fields of time, Counting the unsown harvests, Longing the stars to climb. What is the soul's true nature? What is the spirit's birth? What is the mind's great sequel? Is it to end on earth? Are we to love unceasing, There in that region of souls? Sweetly the vision of heaven On to the Life-giver rolls! That spirit of Fancy flowing, Flowing in dreams of night; Sweeping the shores of darkness, Yet bearing an angel's light. ROUND THE CORNER. Round the corner waiting— What will people say? If you wish to see me There's a proper way: Village tongues are ever Ready with remark; Eyes are at the casement If a dog but bark. Round the corner waiting— What will people say? If you wish to see me There's a proper way. When the Church hath bound us, Link'd two hearts in one, I shall care but little How their tongues rail on; But until the bridal, Never let them find Aught to cause me blushes— Hurt my peace of mind! Round the corner waiting— What will people say? Manly hearts should ever Take a manly way. Fifty things are stated, Things you'd ne'er suppose, If but something secret In a neighbour shows: Boldly take the pathway, And their lips are stayed; All are quick to censure If you seem afraid. Round the corner waiting— What will people say? If you wish to see me There's a proper way! THE BRITISH PRESS. What's nobler than the Press? Where else may Freedom find The ready hand that can redress The wrongs of human kind? It is a people's power— The terror of the strong: Abler than armies in the hour Of tyranny and wrong. The sword may strike oppression down; But sharper than the sword, And mightier than a monarch's crown, The Press maintains its word! It marks the footsteps of the age, The progress of the time; Its seal is stamp'd on every page, In every land and clime: It setteth principle above The brutal hand of force, And forth, in usefulness and love, It runs its glorious course! And they whose meaner minds can scheme To crush its honest sway, As well, in fruitless hate, might dream To check the light of day. What's dearer than the Press To every manly heart? What voice is first the right to bless, To act the patriot's part? The spirit, manners, customs, arts, Opinions, changes,—all That worth to human life imparts,— Its columns can recall. It moves—and every bar is hurl'd Athwart its path like weeds! It speaks—and it divides the world In parties, powers, and creeds! The textures of our social state, The aspects of the past,— When different creeds fed mutual hate, And conscience overcast,— These live within its potent lines, And ancient errors show; From these a guiding spirit shines Which every man should know. When stood the Press with front of steel, While meaner champions fled? When it was crime to set the heel Upon the serpent's head! What's holier than the Press, Which hallows every home; Which lifts the darkness from distress, And points the light to come! Which teaches faith when hope is dull; And, onward as we plod, Reveals to us the beautiful, Uprising like a god! For not uncared for, in his day Of sorrow, man hath been: Angels have watched his troubled way, And helped him when unseen! 'Tis true the men are few That turn with grateful hearts, To names where every meed is due That human fame imparts; 'Tis easy to forget The patriot debt we owe; But there are dates in history yet Time cannot overthrow! The men that battled for the right When right was hard to win; Who braved the axe, and laugh'd at might, When Might called Freedom sin. Great hearts have girt thee round, O Press, revered of yore! Burke, Milton, More, have crown'd Thy rule for evermore! Their sacred banner was “Advance!” Integrity their guide, And Truth the consecrated lance That swept each bar aside! Such are the names our land should bless! The song of age and youth Should still be, Honour to the Press, And Victory to Truth! Then, if thy power be great, Great be thy justice too; Be fearless in thy place to state Whate'er to man is due. Be thou to every heart a guide, A lamp to every mind; So shall thy course be sanctified— Teaching, as God design'd; And never be thy power abused, Thy mission here misled; Oh, never may thou stand accused Before the Patriot Dead! Lend Education aid Where'er thy voice can reach; No text is more obey'd Than that the Press can preach. Bid trade the wide earth span; Speed labour to its due; Bid mind-enlightened man God's Eden-world renew. Still every good befriend, And every ill enthral, Till man's improvement end But with the end of all! BIRTHDAY LYRIC. Down the ladder of Aurora, When she hath the day before her, And the East is clasp'd in gold, Saw I angels swift descending, With a glory never-ending, And a majesty untold; And I whisper'd lowly—slowly— “Whither tend ye, angels holy?” Spake they forth—“We bring affection To a heart of our selection— To the birthday of a being We, afar from heaven seeing, Loved: and bear, by Faith's direction, One pure, priceless gift—Affection!” Then the scene, like music, fainted Far away in waves of light; And a vision like one sainted, In some old cathedral painted, Flash'd its wonder on my sight! Down a silvery pathway gliding, In a robe of starry binding, Moved the Presence upon earth; And I sought my fear to banish, Lest, in speaking, it might vanish, Saying, “Whither, angel fair?” And it whisper'd, soft as air, “I bring gifts to one, whose spirit Well deserveth to inherit— Friendship, that departeth never! Love, still faithful, fond for ever! Equal to a life's endurance— To another world's securance! So, when death to heaven may guide her, Love shall linger still beside her, Friendship mourn o'er days departed, Nature weep for the true-hearted; Virtue every gift commendeth, May she keep them till life endeth!” Fled my dream;—for Morn, the singer, O'er my couch her sunbeams held; And with touch of golden finger All my angel-world dispell'd! Ah, methought, if love were given Thus, how we should prize its worth— In its nature all of heaven That might enter aught of earth! Ah, if friendship falter'd never, Heart to heart, and thus for ever! Yet ourselves within must find Charm to gain, and skill to bind; Soul must shine ere friendship's won— There's no summer without sun! Heart must glow ere love can rest, And call God's angel to the breast! CHRIST BLESSING LITTLE CHILDREN. If there were language in each star, A voice in every onward wave; If every breeze that travell'd far, An ever-during utterance gave; They yet must fail to tell the worth Of those blest words Christ spake on earth. Oh morn, it was no light of sun That left such glory on thy face! It was a light in Christ begun— A sun that ne'er will run its race! A light—a sun—whose endless ray Shall cheer affliction's darkest day! Blest words, that wider circle fill Than frail humanity can span; That thrill—and shall for ages thrill— The universal heart of man: Words with eternal comfort rife— Words throbbing with immortal life! Though weak the little feet that came Half coyly to the Saviour's side; Though small the lips that lisp'd His name, Though check'd by His disciples' pride, He, who beholdeth all things, saw In each child's face God's written law. As in the seed we know the flower That future suns shall wake to birth; So, in the child, Christ saw that dower Which speaks of other worlds than earth! That germ which sleeps in quiet might Till God shall call it into light! Though they could neither see nor hear What then our Saviour saw and heard— The glory of another sphere! The music of Jehovah's word! To His divine humanity All things of heaven were open'd free. Oh, fitting theme for painter's art, That brings the Past before man's eyes; That bids him from no portion part, Till angels meet him in the skies! What worthier theme for painter's skill Than hope which Christian truths fulfil? He, who did little children bless, Will still receive and bless them now: Kneel to Him in your loveliness— Pray for His hand to press your brow: That hand which life to all hath given, That welcomes all from earth to heaven! Christ waiteth!—shall your Saviour plead, And you, with children at your knee, Still pause, their little steps to lead, To Him who loves them more than ye? Teach, father, teach the way He trod; Lead, mother, lead thy child to God! LINES WRITTEN ON THE DEATH OF MISS FLEMING. Inscribed to William Fleming, Esq., M.D. There's a land where hearts united Live, unknowing change or time; Where the leaves and flowers unblighted Speak of an eternal clime: There's a land that knows not sorrow, Sees not tears of anguish flow; Fears no trial for the morrow— To that land, oh, let us go! Here affection still is weeping Over friends that must depart; Here we love—but there's no keeping Those we love around our heart. Where's the home that death bereaves not? Where's the heart that ne'er felt woe? To that land where friendship grieves not— To that land, oh, let us go! From the morn a ray is darting, Which must end in clouds of night; On the earth we read but “Parting!” Leaf and flower the same word write. To that land where Morning dies not, Where the skies immortal glow, Where the heart in parting sighs not— To that land, oh, let us go! There—where angels are repeating Hymns to God, who doth restore Heart to heart in endless meeting— Boundless love for evermore. Mother, 'tis a child that names thee, 'Tis a seraph whispers low; Brother, 'tis a sister claims thee— To that land, oh, let us go! In affliction's hour of trial, Let our faith more perfect rise; Teach our love a brief denial, Ask that peace which God supplies! So the future shall grow dearer, Knowing what it can bestow; So our mission shall be clearer In that land to which we go! HELP EACH OTHER. I never knew a kindness yet, But, as Time's seasons ran, Some seed of hope from it was set That promised good for man: I never knew a feeling heart, In needful cases shown, But it a spirit could impart Congenial to its own! For kindness is a power divine, An essence not of earth; It wreathes the everlasting shrine Where holiest things have birth: It hath a life beyond to-day; And, when this life is o'er, 'Twill meet us smiling on our way, And good for good restore! I never knew a generous hand Grow poorer for such deed; A power we all can understand Still bids that hand succeed. Whate'er a noble act may cost, Whate'er the service given, A kindness done is never lost; Neither on earth nor heaven! A DAY AGO. A day!—a thing but few regard— A drop upon the stream of life— A flower upon the summer sward, Where thousand other flowers are rife! Yet o'er the dial of our fate There is a finger moving slow; How long 't will move, what tongue can state? What's death was life a day ago! Ah! solemn task, to teach the soul The value of a moment's space; Our thoughts and wishes to control, And look on Truth with fearless face! To strip from Hope its rainbow dress, Its false, false glitter, and its show: All life—to man—is littleness! All time—to God—a day ago! Use time, and use it wisely, then; Esteem it at its proper worth; Nor say, were years to come again, We would act differently on earth. Be grateful for the bounties sent, And patient when they cease to flow; Soon—soon—we learn how much is meant By those brief words—A day ago! GOOD ADVICE. Who receives advice with kindness— Marks its simple, plain intent? Who, discarding selfish blindness, Taketh counsel as 'tis meant? Ah! too often, what was merely Urged to caution or improve, Toucheth vanity too nearly, Hurts our feeling—pride—self-love Surely, hearts of wiser feeling, Should be joyed to find a friend Any hint or thought revealing, Formed to warn, instruct, amend. Courtly phrase and false pretences, Outward smile and servile show, May indeed avoid offences: Friends a higher office know! What, though other lips may pander To each weakness of our youth, Better to receive with candour, Honest, open, manly truth. Take, then, truth without resistance, Use it, and its worth discern; To the last day of existence All have something yet to learn. THE MERRY HEART. 'Tis well to have a merry heart, However short we stay: There's wisdom in a merry heart, Whate'er the world may say. Philosophy may lift its head And find out many a flaw, But give me the philosophy That's happy with a straw. If life but bring us happiness, It brings us, we are told, What's hard to buy, though rich ones try With all their heaps of gold. Then laugh away, let others say Whate'er they will of mirth; Who laughs the most may truly boast He's got the wealth of earth. There's beauty in a merry laugh, A moral beauty, too: It shows the heart's an honest heart, That's paid each man his due; And lent a share of what's to spare, Despite of wisdom's fears, And made the cheek less sorrow speak, The eye weep fewer tears. The sun may shroud itself in cloud, The tempest-wrath begin; It finds a spark to cheer the dark, Its sunlight is within. Then laugh away, let others say Whate'er they will of mirth; Who laughs the most may truly boast He's got the wealth of earth. THE MAGIC GLASS. Hither maidens, merry maidens! Come and view my magic glass! I can tell you many marvels, All things as they're sure to pass! I can see adventure growing, Through a mystic power sublime; Watch the hand of Fortune throwing Treasures in the lap of Time! Come then, maidens, merry maidens! Come and see my magic glass! All the wonders I shall whisper, True as time, are sure to pass! Time, that like a seed appeareth, Dry and dark, and hard to view; I can show you how it reareth Leaf, and bud, and flow'ret too: Leaf of friendship, coyly hidden, Flower of love, that shuns the sight! Things to other eyes forbidden, Unto mine are clear as light! Come then, maidens, merry maidens! Come and view my magic glass! All the wonders I shall whisper, True as time, are sure to pass! Like a stage I see the future,— Signs and symbols o'er it crowd, Wild as wintry stars at midnight, And they speak to me aloud: Tell me secrets worth believing, Secrets with instruction rife— What the loom of Fate is weaving From the mingled threads of life. Come then, maidens, merry maidens! Come and view my magic glass! All the wonders I shall whisper, Sure as time, shall come to pass! THE FORTRESS. What fortress spans this rock forlorn? What sea mourns at its feet? Its walls “might laugh a siege to scorn,” Its tide engulph a fleet! Yet rusted swing its iron gates; Scant guard the warder keeps; One at the portal stands and waits,— One stands, and waits, and weeps. The banner lifts its batter'd crest Above the shipless tide; The harbour seems in little quest, Nor pilot here, nor guide. Ho! tell me who this fortress claims? Who claims? the watcher saith— One who with joy each angel names, The heir of all is Faith! And 'tis the banner of our God That floats upon the morn; This is the Rock that all have trod Who've sprung, through Faith, new born. Though few the feet that enter in, Yet shall a day appear, When God shall strike the gates of sin, And all shall enter here. LINES ON THE DEATH OF SIR JOHN POTTER, M.P., FOUNDER OF THE FREE LIBRARY. Life and Death—two words containing More than human thought can span: What is Death?—the dust remaining Utters no response to man. We behold:—but earthly vision Cannot compass that domain, Cannot climb that world Elysian Where the dead new life attain. Life is duty!—noblest therefore He who best that course selects; Never waiting, asking “Wherefore?”— Acting as his heart directs! Feeling, that through Education Lies the secret of all good; That to make a happy nation, Men must first be understood! Know each other—aid each other— Short the space 'twixt life and death, When the lowest shall be brother To the highest that have breath. Thou who felt for human labour, Knew its means and pleasures few, Thou that sought thy humbler neighbour; Teaching others what to do! Thousands,—in the far to-morrow,— Shall survey this hallowed ground, And with tears of silent sorrow Bless the friend their fathers found! All that is of power or beauty Passeth from our steps away; In the path of Faith and Duty Honour lives, though Man decay. OLD FRIENDS AND OLD TIMES. Thinking of old times, Hopes ne'er to be; Speaking of old friends Far o'er the sea: Distance can change not Dear ones like you; Fortune estrange not Hearts that are true! Thus, in the twilight, Fond thoughts will stray Back to the old homes— Homes far away! Oh! 'mid the old friends, I no more see, Is there a kind thought Ever for me? If there's but one hope, One wish, though vain; If there's but one sigh, I'll not complain. Thus in the twilight Tears oft will stray, Thinking of old friends,— Friends far away. TO THE YOUNG. If a dower to man were granted, Free and boundless in extent, Hills on which renown was planted, Soil for widest culture meant; What would be the donor's sorrow If that unattended earth Show'd no promise for the morrow, Nothing but defect and dearth? Or, if some small cultivation, But in patches scatter'd o'er, Flowers—a few for decoration— Just in front, and nothing more! All the vast extent behind it Left without one seed to grow; Left—as Time ought ne'er to find it, Since God bade the sun to glow! Oh, the gift of mind is greater Than the gift of land can be: Nothing from our kind Creator Breathes so much of deity; Nothing through the world's extension Equals that eternal dower; Scarce an angel's comprehension Spans the vastness of its power! If, then, but a thin partition Of that mind true culture knows, If no tillage gains admission, Nought that right advancement shows, Is it grateful to the Donor Who—some purpose to fulfil— Made ye of such power the owner, To be careless of his will? Is it grateful to the spirit Poorly thus its worth to scan, To neglect what you inherit, Disregard God's gift to man? Is it wise to rest contented With this half-instructed state? Lost time ne'er was unrepented, But regret may come too late! Work then, youth, while yet 'tis morning, Broad the land before you lies, Neither task nor labour scorning; Which the fruit of thought supplies; As you work so choose your station, Knowing life and its demands; Knowing 'tis through cultivation That the living mind expands! A HEART FOR EVERY ONE. Oh! there's a heart for every one, If every one could find it; Then up and seek, ere youth be gone, Whate'er the toil ne'er mind it! For if you chance to meet at last With that one heart, intended To be a blessing unsurpass'd, Till life itself is ended, How would you prize the labour done, How grieve if you'd resign'd it; For there's a heart for every one, If every one could find it. Two hearts are made, the angels say, To suit each other dearly; But each one takes a different way, A way not found so clearly!— Yet though you seek, and seek for years, The trouble's worth the taking, For what the life of home endears Like hearts of angels' making? Then haste, and guard the treasure won, When fondly you've enshrin'd it; For there's a heart for every one, If every one could find it? THANK GOD FOR ALL. Beside yon oak a rustic roof appears, A cottage garden leads unto the door, A few wild plants the lowly casement cheers, And all around looks neat, though all is poor. There Philip dwells, and takes a neighbour's part, Though little be the means his help to test; Yet still, though poor, he says, with grateful heart, 'Tis well to labour,—and that God knows best! The hare flits by him with her dewy feet, As blithe of heart he quits his cottage gate; The golden village lane with dawn is sweet, And Philip feels content, though low his state; For labour unto him can joy impart, 'Tis independence to his honest breast; And still, though poor, he says, with grateful heart, 'Tis well to labour,—and that God knows best! His wife beside the door waits his return, His children's voices meet him half the way, And while the sun within the west doth burn, And bird and brook sing sweet the close of day, Philip forgets his toil, his chair to find, By little arms and little lips caress'd; And gazing round, exclaims, with grateful mind, Thank God for all,—thank God, who knoweth best! THE CROSS OF CHRIST. INSCRIBED TO THE REV. J. M. BELLEW, S.C.L. O Cross of Christ! first rear'd 'mid scoff and scorn, Cherish'd in secret 'gainst a bad world's hate; Now on the neck of maiden beauty worn— Blazing 'mid arms and banners of the state— The flags of navies, crown'd and consecrate! Erst type of persecution, shame, and blood; Now the bow'd knees of nations on thee wait; And kings adore, where burning martyrs stood, Like Faith amidst the flames, unchanged and unsubdued! O blest of Heaven, Religion, God-born guide! Not thine the torture and the bigot chain, Not thine the unsparing creed, the zealot pride That would, through persecution, Christ attain! Thou hast no heavenly joy in human pain; But ever com'st by love and mercy led; Yet wert thou parent call'd by many a Cain, Who from the altar struck his brother dead, And pray'd with gore-stain'd hands, as if 'twere incense shed! Come to our souls and make us all thine own; Come with thy brow of truth, thy lip of grace— Thy peace, which is the light of Jesus' throne; Thy hope, which beameth like an angel's face; Oh, come, Religion, all the world embrace! For all are brothers, and God's home would seek: Back to thy breast our erring footsteps trace; Teach us with Christian charity to speak, Nor crouch to high estate, nor trample on the weak! To preach the Gospel!—to illume the dark, Strengthen the weak, upraise the poor and low; To seek in humble breasts the struggling spark, And with the breath of truth to bid it glow: To lead the frail, irresolute, and slow Unto the fount of everlasting light! To teach them to believe what God doth show In every dawning day and setting night: To call the erring back, and guide their feet aright. This is to preach the Gospel of our Lord! To lead through love, persuade through Mercy's tongue: And thou, to whom I dedicate each word, Whose zeal, whose genius I have honour'd long, Still, arm'd with eloquence, convince the throng; Assure the doubtful—win the heedless breast, Bid lips, long mute, thrill with Jehovah's song! Show the afflicted where their griefs may rest,— So shall thy name be loved, and thy true mission blest! THE OLD EVENINGS. I wander'd by the old house, But others now live there; I thought about the old times And all we used to share. How happy 'twas our wont to meet, When friends came frank and free. Ah, when shall we such faces greet As once we used to see In those old merry evenings, Those pleasant friendly evenings, Beneath the old roof tree? But what though we'd the old house, We still should lack old cheer, The old friends in the old house Were all that made it dear! And these are fled, or changed, or dead, And never more may we Revive the music of their tread— The joys that used to be In those old friendly evenings, Those long-departed evenings, Beneath the old roof tree! THE CHARITIES OF LIFE. If thou hast pass'd an aching heart, Turn back a little way, Let not “thy giving” be a part To act another day! Give whilst the weary eye is dim, And if a tear should fall, 'Twill be in gratitude to Him Who heard the mourner's call. Oh, in the charities of life This impulse still obey; And if thou'st pass'd an aching heart Turn back a little way! It is not far the feet can go; The shadow cometh fast; And whether we move fast or slow, 'Tis to one bourn at last. When thy “to-morrows” all have died, Kind actions will appear Like angels waiting at thy side To bless thee, and to cheer! Then in the charities of life This impulse still obey; And if thou'st pass'd an aching heart Turn back a little way! LITTLE REQUIRED. 'Tis little indeed we require, A cot just removed from the way, All cover'd with woodbine and briar, And Norah still with me each day. We can live upon nothing at all, For what do we care for display? Love can smile though his income be small, Yes, that's what he used to say! Ah, me! that's what he used to say! Then love before marriage could see No figure so fair as my own; Now figures in columns of three Perplex him and alter his tone! He wonders how bills can come in In this strange unaccountable way; And frowns, with his hand to his chin, And forgets what he used to say, Ah, me! forgets what he used to say! He says that he loves me the same,— There's nothing, at least, I detect;— But a maid when she changes her name Hath many a change to expect. I wish better times would appear, That Harry again might be gay, And whisper once more in my ear The words that he used to say, Ah, me! the words that he used to say! EVERYBODY'S GIPSY. Hope's the Gipsy queen of life, Fortune's hidden light revealing; Whisp'ring better stars are rife In the depths the cloud's concealing: She is seen at many gates— Many sighs to her are given;— If we credit all she states, She's her knowledge straight from heaven. More than any gipsy known She sets all things in confusion: She's the one whose power alone Keeps the whole world in delusion! Kings and peers her voice obey, High and low her spells she tosses; E'en the poor and aged stay When their path of life she crosses: Soldiers on the tented field, Sailors on the stormy ocean, Unto her their secrets yield; None on earth have such devotion. More than any gipsy known She sets all things in confusion; She's the one whose power alone Keeps the whole world in delusion. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION? 'Tis my belief, that if you show Your heart to any one you know, Or let your cheek with blushes glow, You shorten Love's dominion: But if you pause, or seem to be Indifferent to his urgent plea; The colder you—the warmer he: Now tell me your opinion, Your opinion; Do tell me your opinion. 'Tis hard when feelings' pulse beats strong To guard the word that seeks the tongue; And hide the secret well—and long: But who would lose dominion? Who let a little word defeat The hopes that in their bosoms beat? Whate'er I felt—he should not see't! At least, that's my opinion, My opinion; At least, that's my opinion! 'Tis said that some are far too nice, Too over-proud to take advice; I only pray you to think twice Before you quit dominion: The more your looks, your lips, express, The more you sigh, he'll sigh the less; 'Till he proposed I'd ne'er confess! At least, that's my opinion, My opinion; At least, that's my opinion! THE WHEREWITHAL. A man may have wisdom and worth, And humour and wit at his call; But what do these matter on earth If he has not the wherewithal? His home may be circled with friends, If he only can keep up the ball; But friendship soon changes and ends If he has not the wherewithal. Then seek for the wherewithal— Make sure of the wherewithal, For pleasure, like friendship, soon ends If you have not the wherewithal. The purse is the dial whose face Shows best where the sunlight doth fall; He always is first in the race, Who is first with the wherewithal! Some say that the high can be mean— Some hint that the great can be small; But trifles like these are not seen, If bless'd with the wherewithal! Then seek for the wherewithal— Make sure of the wherewithal, For pleasure, like friendship, soon ends, If short of the wherewithal. Love smiles on the casement that shows A picture within to enthral; When gold's in the heart of the rose, There's love in the wherewithal? Yes; men may have wisdom and worth, And humour and wit at their call, But what do these matter on earth If they have not the wherewithal! Then seek for the wherewithal— Make sure of the wherewithal, For pleasure, like friendship, soon ends, If short of the wherewithal! PASSING AWAY. I Look from the casement!—look, and tell What's passing, mother, dear; Since dawn I've heard a funeral bell, Slow pealing on my ear; And now there comes the solemn fall Of footsteps sweeping nigh. Look down the street, I hear their feet, Some funeral's passing by. The mother gazed with anxious face, But nothing there was seen, Except each old accustom'd place, And what had always been. II A moment yet, dear mother, stay; Strange sounds are on the air, Like angels singing on their way Or voices deep in prayer! Oh, lift my pillow high—more high— For I am faint and low; Help me to look upon the sky, And bless them ere they go! The mother raised her daughter's head, But no word could she speak; The hope that from her bosom sped Left tears upon her cheek. III The night look'd through the casement old, And saw a cheek so pale— A form so wasted, thin, and cold— No skill might there prevail; But that which conquers Death yet beam'd Upon her wasted brow; And sweet, as though an angel dream'd, The sufferer rested now! Ah, who the mother's grief may tell? Or who may comfort bring? Yet, high above the funeral bell, She heard the angels sing! DEAD, YET UNDIVIDED. They are together still,— The parted still are one! Their love our being's home can fill, Although the loved be gone! The mystery of the spirit's birth Outfathoms human skill; Though one's in heaven, and one on earth, They are together still! For there's a feeling that unites The distant and the dead; The last sweet bloom that winter blights, Yet leaves the odour shed: And thus affection lives beyond Death's dark and withering will; No power hath he to part the fond,— They meet, in spirit, still! In quiet thought, in lonely prayer, That spirit all pervades, It lends a glory to the air When every planet fades; It circles all with holiness, It blunts the barb of ill; And e'en the parted it can bless, And link together still! THE HOPES GONE BY. The hopes gone by—the hopes that made A golden path to other years; Ere yet our hearts had known a shade, Or life had lost what life endears: The bounding heart—the spirits' play— The thoughts that seem'd on wings to fly— We ask in vain,—ah, where are they? The days, the dreams, the hopes gone by! The brightness and the bloom have fled, And life seems cold as wintry snow; For some are changed, and some are dead, That knew and loved us long ago! Those golden visions come no more As once they came, when hope was high, Yet dear, till life's last pulse is o'er, Will be the days, the hopes, gone by! FLOWERS. Flowers, sweet Flora's children! How ye sport and spring, Smiling between bank and brook, Mossy marge, and woody nook, Where the linnets sing; Climbing hedgerow, bush, and brier, As your spirit ne'er would tire, Thorough lane and lea: Full of life, and full of mirth. Ye alone enjoy the earth,— Happy children ye! Flowers, sweet Flora's children! How ye roam and race, By the valley—up the hill, With an everchanging will, Haunting every place; Hanging half-way down the steep, Where the wild stag dare not leap, In your reckless glee; Or, where snows eternal blanch, Listening to the avalanche,— Bold adventurers ye! Flowers, sweet Flora's children! How ye dance and twine With the loveliest born of Spring, Moving in an endless ring— An exhaustless line! Sometimes shy and singly seen, Like some nun, in cloister green, Offering incense free; Sometimes over marsh and moor, Resting by the cottage-door,— Welcome comers ye! Flowers, dear Flora's children! How ye love to meet Far away from human sound, Making Nature hallow'd ground— Even loneness sweet; Where some fount, 'mid mountain-springs, Singing falls, and falling sings In melodious key; Blooming where no step is heard, Save the light foot of some bird,— Favour'd children ye! Flowers, sweet Flora's children! Loved by moon and star; Loved by little ramblers lone, Seated on some grassy stone,— Many a footstep far! Loved by all that God hath made, All that ever watch'd and pray'd: For ye seem to me, In your bright and boundless span, Silent speakers unto man Of the world to be! MORN. See morn o'er the heavens Is sailing divine; Her barque is all golden And purple each line; Her flag blue and crimson; And over the skies She sweeps in her beauty, To gladden all eyes. The chequer'd horizon Spreads wide on the sight, Like islands of glory Where angels alight! And the barque dashes onward O'er billows of clouds, Whilst the lark, like a sailor, Sings high 'mid the shrouds! Oh! that man through life's voyage, Whatever storm wars, Would keep his soul's pennant Still fix'd 'mid the stars! Till the harbour appearing, For which he had striven, Life's vessel might rest, Safely anchor'd in Heaven. THE HIDDEN DELL. O'er a wide heath whose purple bloom had fled, Or fallen low for winds to sweep about, Just as Aurora show'd her drowsy head, As if to wake or slumber still in doubt, Straight from the path—the rude, broad path, scoop'd out Abrupt and startling—there appear'd a dell, From whose green mouth, as from some shrine devout, The panting waters seem'd with pride to swell, Then down the rocky cleft with rapid music fell. By root, or rock, or hanging bush I sped, Until a broken arch and gate were seen, That to a strange deserted garden led; O'ergrown, and all one melancholy green, Save here and there some flowery shrub between, Or ancient statue from its column cast,— A majesty of grandeur that had been A memory of the proud and prosperous past,— Stood haughty in decay—still stately to the last! With sighs the woods unto my step replied, And from the trembling leaves hung many a tear, Which the stern winds, as angry, brushed aside— For what might tears avail gaunt ruin here? Nor grief could change, nor gleam of gladness cheer The desolation and the blight around: Yet one lone flower, like infant beauty near, Kiss'd with its honey'd lip the wither'd ground, And smiled upon the thorns to which its bloom was bound. Something, I know not what, detain'd me there: 'Midst grandeur and neglect I wander'd on, Till, all at once, the path show'd touch of care; In golden groups the tended flowrets shone, Bright as Love's footsteps, and as swiftly gone; A broken rose-stem, with a ribbon tied, Told of a maiden's hand—some lovely one Perchance still near: quick sought I every side, But still nor fluttering veil, nor vestment white espied. Anon the pathway turn'd—a steep ascent— Then lost itself in venerable shade; My very breath with toil seem'd almost spent, When shot a gleam of silver through the glade. Some bird its home and happy nest had made By path which human footstep rarely chose; Willing to seek, and yet to stir afraid, Tiptoe I followed where the dim boughs close, And looking down beheld my Maiden of the Rose. Half hid 'mid waves and weeds the maiden stood, Bathing her beauty in the happy brook, Whose waters clasp'd her in a pearly flood; Or, flowing fondly, stole an upward look, As of her beauty they some portion took; Then, turning, leapt unto her waist: whilst she From her white hands the liquid sparkles shook, And cast them in the air, like diamonds free, A thousand times more pure, more beautiful to see. Straightway a swan came sailing up the stream, To which she call'd, and with a timid grace It sidled near her—quiet as a dream! The nymph kept, like a statue, in her place; Then sudden stoop'd, and scatter'd in its face A thousand wave-drops—back it fled in fear, Ruffled its brilliant feathers from the chase, Then slowly round its sidelong course did steer, Stretch'd its broad wings, and boldly darted near! As flew the swan so flew the maiden fair; Then caught a scarf, with which the boughs were drest, And flung it o'er its wings—it sprang in air! Flash'd the white waters from its panting breast, Whilst she laugh'd loud, and mock'd its ruffled crest! Seeming some creature of ethereal birth; Ere long a butterfly besought her quest— Up flew the scarf in light and playful mirth, The butterfly and maid seem'd both too bright for earth! Lured by the sound of waters, soft and shy From 'neath the woods, a dappled fawn tripp'd slow; Gazing askance with ever restless eye, Until half gain'd the singing stream below; Anon he listen'd—unresolved to go. Then did the merry drops in music sink: Onward he leapt all eager for its flow, And bent his beauteous head as if to drink, Unconscious he of nymph close watching at the brink. Swift flew the scarf—the dappled fawn was caught! It plunged, it swerved—away the wavelets flew; With matchless grace the maid her captive brought Amidst the weeds, and kept it struggling through; Then tighter round the silken bandage drew: It rear'd, it leapt!—the stream in fountains spread! Oh, Love, the sport, the strife, between the two! At last a rush of waters o'er her head O'erpower'd the laughing nymph, and free the glad fawn fled. Swift with the racing fawn I hurried thence, Nor let one breaking branch my haunt betray, But left to sweetness and to innocence The Beauty and her bath, and stepp'd away. Guarded by angels be her sanctuary! Still her companions prove the swan and fawn, Still happy with the butterfly to play, Bathe in the brook, or dance upon the lawn, Or meet with lips of song the golden grace of dawn. THE SOUL. What is the Soul? It may not be A light which chance hath waked to birth; Nor is that power, Necessity, The mother of the earth. Materialists in vain may teach That Nature form'd this glorious whole; In worlds which science cannot reach, “God!—God made man a living soul!” What is the Soul?—A deathless ray— A gift of that immortal Hand Which from blind chaos struck the day, And held, unpoised, the sea and land; Who o'er the earth shed beauty rife, Who gave the Elements their might, Who waked the planets into life, And bowed the starry globe of night. From stern Necessity call grace— Call order from the dreams of chance— Bid your material god replace The heavenly fountain we advance: The seasons would return no more, The erring planets lose their track, Confusion stalk from shore to shore, And Ruin shout to Chaos back! Can knowledge, then, oppress the brain, O'erload the reason's glorious might; Imagination's wing restrain, And blind our intellectual sight?— No: the rivers of the world combined Have never fill'd the boundless sea; And what is ocean to the mind? Like time unto eternity! Not knowledge hath debased the sense, But vice—that, even in our youth, Saith to Religion's light—“Go hence! I will not, dare not, know the truth! If I deceive myself, 'tis well: Let me live on, and still deceive; If sinners tread the brink of hell, 'Twere death to Tremble and believe!” O God, the Father of the Soul! O Jesus, Saviour of the world! Bid knowledge spread from pole to pole, Be Faith's bright banner wide unfurl'd. For whatsoe'er the soul may be, Or wheresoe'er the soul may dwell, To live for God's eternity Is better than to live for hell! AN EARLY VISITOR. The dewy morn, with golden feet, Came sighing fond, and blushing sweet; And o'er the casement's flowery stand Reclined her warm and brilliant hand; Stole from the rose its rath perfume, And leapt, all glowing, in the room; Shook gold upon the carpet round, Each printed form, with sunthreads bound. Anon—as if half weary there— Her golden limbs adorned a chair; And flashed a hundred brilliant hues On classic Reynolds' “Tragic Muse;” Pressed golden kisses o'er the pearl Of Christall's lovely “Shepherd Girl;” And, spite of Shakspere's verse of old, Kept gilding still refinèd gold!— At last a little over-free, She threw herself upon my knee; In beaming glances met my looks, And blinded me for reading books: Red, green, or orange spots were all I found where'er my sight could fall; 'Till, half provoked, I wish'd the maid Were fairly buried in the shade! For, jealous of the least advance, She struck the fire out with a glance; Then, as with music's gifts to please, Her sparkling fingers touched the keys! 'Twas something to be seen, not heard, Too eloquent for note, or word: Cecilia's hand, though oft admired, Had ne'er such brilliancy inspired; Could ne'er intenser gaze enthral; But then, alas, the touch was all! So I to business hurried then; Engagements with commercial men Sped swift the time; whilst Morn withdrew To vernal scenes and pleasures new; Through lanes with honeysuckle sweet, Through many a sylvan, calm retreat; Danced with the ripple of the brook, Still gilding every path she took; And, oh! till we again may meet, May Heaven bless those golden feet! BLAME ME NOT. They blame this changeless brow of care, This silent woe they blame: They little know how sweet's despair, If it but breathe thy name! They little think how passing dear Is sadness unto me; How sweet the sorrow, sweet the tear, In silence shed for thee! Life hath no home, no hope, no love— The dove hath lost her ark— The very face of heaven above Seems hopeless now and dark: Yet little think they, still how dear Is sadness unto me— How sweet the sorrow, sweet the tear, In silence shed for thee! THE DEAD SWAN. (THE STREAM LAMENTETH FOR HER LOST COMPANION.) Darkly now and lonely Night on me descends; Once and but once only We've been parted friends! What doth Life inherit That can Hope impart? Oh, sweet Bird, or Spirit, Tell me where thou art! With a troubled feeling Came the Night profound; With a sigh revealing Sorrow all around! Sounds too sad to lose them Through the forest crept, Whilst upon my bosom Thou in beauty slept! Ill could ne'er betide me, Through the wildest night; There thou lay beside me Like a beam of light! Till the dark hour ending, To thy happy stream, Forest deer descending Woke thee from thy dream! Then thy beauty darted All its rays of light, Like a sylph thou started In thy sparkling flight! Whilst the deer—though frighted From the water's brink— Paused, as half delighted, And forgot to drink. O ye Stars, that often In my heart have slept, Fate's decree now soften: Long and lone I've wept! Where is she whose brightness Lent the rash delight; Know ye, in your lightness? Answer, Stars of night! Not a voice repeateth Tidings where thou art, Save the wave that beateth O'er my troubled heart; Save the winds that slowly 'Neath the sedges rise, Every feeling holy Into silence dies! Not the stars can bring her Back to life and day; Why should I then linger? Waste, poor Stream, away! What doth Life inherit That can Hope impart? Oh, sweet Bird, or Spirit, Tell me where thou art! THE LOST ONE FOUND. The mother's hearth is lone, her child hath roam'd away— A truant from the morning meal, till now the close of day; And whither he hath wandered, what field-path he hath cross'd, She knows not, but distractedly is seeking for her lost! He used to play so cheerfully about the cottage-door, No wanderer after bee and bird—he loved his mother more! And now, though every spot she'd search'd within the village ground, She dared not meet her husband's face until his boy was found. Where wild nuts grow, and blackberries their tempting treasure bear, She sought; she ask'd each cotter's girl—but none had seen him there; She told them of his fair young face, his sunny curls, his years; But when she strove to tell them more, she could not for her tears. Away she sped o'er upland field, and by the orchard bank, Until she near'd a rushy brook, whose bridge was but a plank; And, half afraid to look therein, she hurried o'er and found Two foot-prints small—the mother knelt and kiss'd the grassy ground! Two little foot-prints o'er the bridge, beside the golden plain; And 'midst the grass a flower-crush'd spot as where a child had lain; And scatter'd rushes wild about show'd where his feet had stray'd— Her child had cross'd the dangerous brook, and must have reach'd the glade. The forest glade, that lonesome track, where 'neath dry leaf and weed The viper hides his venom'd fang, and noxious insects breed; Where—ah! was that a garment moved? She rush'd into the wood, Alas! 'twas but the hawthorn gray before whose boughs she stood. By thicket and wild brake she search'd, but every trace was gone; It could not be so mere a child thus far had rambled on: And, sinking down bewilder'd, unknowing how to stir, She heard a voice, a little voice, but, oh! 'twas bliss to her! And forth he ran, the truant one, and clasp'd his mother's knees, Put up his fruit-stain'd lips to kiss, and tried each art to please; And bade the weeper not to cry, although his own poor cheek Show'd traces of his day's-long tears in many a piteous streak. And in that wood the mother sat, and pointed to the sky, And bade her boy remember Him who'd watch'd him from on high! Had sent his influence down to guard his little footsteps there; So with her child, the mother knelt—and blessed her God in prayer. TORQUATO TASSO. [Torquato Tasso, one of the most celebrated poets that Italy ever produced, was born at Sorrento in 1544. His works show him to have been a philosopher, an orator, a logician, a critic, and a poet, excelling in every kind of composition. While he was at the court of Alphonso, Duke of Ferrara, he incurred that prince's anger by his passion for the Princess Leonora of Este, his patron's sister; and being somewhat disordered in his intellect, he was ungenerously shut up in a madhouse for seven years, where he underwent the most illiberal treatment. Tasso himself says that every rigour and inhumanity it is possible to conceive were practised towards him. The remonstrances of several Italian princes at length procured his release; and when Cardinal Aldobrandini ascended the papal chair by the name of Clement VIII., he invited him to Rome, resolving to confer upon him the laureate crown in the Capitol. While, however, the preparations were going on for this ceremony with the greatest magnificence and pomp—promising to be the most splendid pageant beheld in Italy for centuries—Tasso was taken ill, and died in 1595.] 'Twas in the minstrel clime of Italy, The hour which marries twilight to the stars; When Memory speaks to Beauty, and the air Seems languishing for silence; at that hour, Beside a classic fount, whose broken arch Portray'd the poet's fortune, Tasso slept. The dying day oft through the parted clouds Shot sudden gleams, and o'er the slumberer's cheek Now light, now shadow swept; and haply these Might touch or influence the poet's dream; For, as he said, two spirits sought his side, And each, alternate, pictured to his mind Visions immortal. Fame and Truth were they, And thus address'd the poet's slumbering ear:— SPIRIT OF FAME. It is the voice of Fame Which greets thee on her flight; The star that shall illume thy name Now trembles into light: Around thee glories wait In long triumphal line; The classic throne, its crown and state, Laurel and lyre, are thine. Thrill, soul of song, with fire! Pour, heart of love, thy lay! Hopes that immortal minds inspire Shed triumph on thy way. The eternal hours prolong The music of thy name; Wake, Tasso, wake! thou heir of song! It is the voice of Fame. SPIRIT OF TRUTH. Avoid that syren voice, Shun the betrayer's tongue; When did the laurel e'er rejoice One victim heart of song! Soar thou the topmost height, Attain the classic leaf, But know the hours of loftiest flight Are ever the most brief. Go, waste thy bloom of years To grace a monarch's state, And nourish Fame's frail flowers with tears, And learn repentance late! Go, court the vain of earth, Seek praise from Beauty's eyes; Then learn how little is the worth Of that thy soul did prize! SPIRIT OF FAME. Oh, charm'd thy lyre shall be, And fill'd with power to move The loftiest minds to chivalry, The noblest hearts to love; And they on whose renown A nation's shouts attend Shall be the first thy lyre to crown, The first to call thee friend. The tournament and feast, The banquet and the ball, These of thine honours shall be least, Thy fame transcend them all: The proud and princely throng Shall worship at thy shrine, Assert the sovereignty of song, And own its gifts divine. SPIRIT OF TRUTH. Oh, fickle is the breath Of popular acclaim; And purchased often but by death Is an illustrious name! Fame, like the rainbow's glow, Is but the type of tears; And Glory's harvest, like the snow, Dissolves and disappears. The envy and the scorn, The penury and pain— Oh, better hadst thou ne'er been born Than wake the poet's strain! That voice doth but deceive: Avoid ambition's goal, Nor let the fire of fancy leave Its ashes on thy soul. SPIRIT OF FAME. Great Rome shall hail thee son! Link'd with the glorious twain, With triumphs Ariosto won, With Dante's matchless strain; For unto thee are given The thoughts that angels breathe; And Tasso's song of heaven The light of hosts shall wreathe. The loveliest of the land, The high-born and the young, Shall deem it fame to kiss the hand That wrote Jerusalem's song. Shake off this soulless thrall, And arm for victory's field; When beauty, love, and glory call, Can Tasso's spirit yield? SPIRIT OF TRUTH. Hark! 'tis the captive's shriek, A voice that loads the air With wrongs too terrible to speak, With madness and despair. It tells of genius lost, Of beauty unattain'd, Of love pursued at reason's cost, Of glory sunk and stain'd. Dimm'd is that noble mind That wing'd to heaven its flight; The frenzied eyes, far worse than blind, Blaze with delirious light: That hand, the Muse inspired, 'Gainst phantom-horror strives; Now starts from hell's imagined fires, Now flees the maniac's gyves. SPIRIT OF FAME. The imperial streets resound, Rome's banners wave on high, And garlands belt the classic ground, As though a king swept by. The hero-bard ascends His coronation throne; And hark! is that a shout which rends Those oracles of stone? The choral voices float In hymns of joy and praise, Cittern, and lyre, and clarion note, Their lofty triumph raise; The Capitolian throng With music sound thy name; Wake, Tasso, wake! thou heir of song! It is the voice of Fame. SPIRIT OF TRUTH. By St. Onofrio's shrine Dark sounds of grief arise; And weeping eyes in woe decline Where a dying minstrel lies. Ah, what are shows or state To that pale drooping head? The tardy triumph comes too late Which comes to crown the dead. Can Rome's proud chaplets now One meed of grace impart? Can Fame relieve the anguish'd brow, Or bind the broken heart? With misery rack'd and bow'd Illustrious Tasso lies; And what avail the applauding crowd, Or shouts that rend the skies? And is't for this reward Thou'lt spend thy soul's rich power! Alas, unhappy bard, Thine is a fatal dower! Yet when were hearts e'er found By Fame's proud breath unstirr'd? Woe that Delusion should be crown'd, And Truth so little heard! ADAM. “And God created Man in His own image.” The Mind is victor over Time; The dial of the brain Points not to hours, but years sublime, That o'er oblivion reign! Immortal as its primal source, It scatters centuries in its course— Explores the worlds of thought; Nor folds its heav'n-enfranchised wing, Till reach'd that intellectual spring Which crowns the shore it sought! The Spirit of the Past appears— The Present fades—is gone! The feelings of unnumber'd years Are centred into one! A radiance o'er my vision glows, While spreads that Eden of repose Ere Sorrow's sway began; I see that morn, whose light unfurl'd, Woke the first Sabbath of the world Upon the soul of man! No cloud hangs o'er the far serene, Earth smiles amidst her flowers, As though that moment God had been In her Elysian bowers! Yet holier than the earth or sky, A presence born of Deity, With grace-illumined brow, Glorious, as from Jehovah's hands, The parent of earth's millions stands Before my vision now. Erect—ere sin had bow'd his frame, And struck his forehead dim; Ere, exiled to eternal shame By swords of cherubim, He heard the voice of God complain— Saw branded on the brow of Cain The mark with murder red; Knew all the horrors guilt must know, Which, like an avalanche of woe, Swept ruin on his head! I mark those lineaments divine, In their immortal bloom; Unmarr'd by one degrading line Prophetic of their doom; I gaze—and back the steeds of thought, Midst years of blood one act had wrought; Then trace the steps of time Through all that sad mortality— The universe of graves to be— From flood, disease, and crime! The cities of the earth display Their toil-oppressed race; Merit neglected on her way, Whilst Pride usurps her place: There lies the plague-polluted corse,— Envy, and Hatred, and Remorse, The Passions' burning flow; There lurks Revenge with poinard bare— Terror that darkens to despair— And Infamy, and Woe! Where now is that imperial form, That majesty of glance, That brow o'er which the soul's wild storm Of passions ne'er advance?— Alas for Sin!—Through ages past Mark Adam's seed in sorrow cast, Still mourners upon earth:— Then, on the Cross of Calvary, Thy crucified Redeemer see, And learn Man's second birth. Rise! rise! ye everlasting spheres, And wake the hymn of life! Praise Him, ye Eighteen Hundred Years With man's salvation rife! Though sin, and woe, and death prevail, The Rock of Ages shall not fail Whilst Faith on earth may dwell; The soul baptised in Christ shall rise Triumphant to its native skies, Despite the powers of hell! WAITING FOR THE COUNTESS. (FROM LANDSEER'S DRAWING OF LADY BLESSINGTON'S FAVOURITE HOUND.) 'Tis sweet to watch the morning break O'er mountains bleak and bare, To view the clouds, like vessels, take The azure sea of air! To watch morn's magic pencil touch Each golden stream and grove;— And sweet it is, when loving much, To wait for her we love. Man speaks of “friendship, faith, and truth,” But oft his acts declare His friendship is a dream of youth, His faith a thing of air! And if an honest heart on earth Is really to be found, 'Tis not so oft in human worth As in the worthier hound! Oh! never knight to ladye bright, Nor bard's impassion'd breath, Nor cavalier in maiden's ear, Ere seem'd more true to death Than this half-reasoning, noble brute, That puts Man's truth to shame; This creature—eloquent though mute!— And friend—in more than name! Thou, loved as genius must be loved; And famed as beauty's famed; Admired wherever thou hast moved, Renown'd wherever named; Not one of all the friends thou'st found, Whose words and looks were sweet, Ere loved thee better than this hound That waits thy coming feet! Rank—station—beauty—what are all, If all yet fail to win A heart still true to friendship's call, Still warm with love within? Oh, Life is lone, and little worth, Unless affection meet A faithfulness like his on earth, That waits thy coming feet! YOUTH AND AGE. The proudest poetry of youth Is—“Would I were a Man!” The golden years that lie between Youth, like a dream, would span: 'Tis in its thought—'tis in its heart— 'Tis ever on its tongue; But oh, the poetry of age, It is—“When I was young!” Thus, in the morn of life, our feet Would distant pathways find; The sun still face to face we meet— The shadow falls behind! But when the morn of life is o'er, And Nature grows less kind; The length'ning shadow creeps before— The sunlight falls behind! With many a murmur, slow and sad, The stream of life flows on; That which we prized not when we had Is doubly prized when gone! And many a sad and solemn truth Lies written on life's page; Between the “Poetry of Youth!” And “Poetry of Age!” RIVA DI SAN MARCO. [It must be borne in mind that the legend which we are about to produce is recorded by more than one authentic chronicler, and that it was sufficiently believed to give birth to a public religious ceremony. In the year 1341, an inundation of many days' continuance had raised the water three cubits higher than it had ever before been seen in Venice; and during a stormy night, while the flood appeared to be still increasing, a poor old fisherman sought what refuge he could find by mooring his bark close to the Riva di San Marco. The storm was yet raging, when three persons approached, and offered him a good fare if he would convey them to the two castles of Sido. Scarcely had they gained the strait, when they saw a galley, rather flying than sailing up the Adriatic, manned (if we may so say) with devils, who seemed hurrying, with fierce and threatening gestures, to sink Venice in the deep. The strangers conjured the fiends to depart: at the word, the demoniacal galley vanished, and the three holy passengers were quietly landed. “Go to the Doge,” said one, “and the procuratori, and assure them that, but for we three, Venice would have been drowned. I am St. Mark; my two comrades are St. George and St. Nicholas.” On the morrow the fisherman did as he was told, and he not only received his fare, but an annual pension to boot. Moreover, a solemn procession and thanksgiving were appointed, in gratitude to the three holy corpses which had rescued from such calamity the land affording them burial. —Abridged from Sketches of Venetian History.] Thrice honour'd be St. Nicholas, St. George, and good St. Mark, And blessings on the fisherman who steer'd the gallant bark; When lower'd the mighty firmament—one black foredooming page:— And wild and high the waves howl'd by, foaming and white with rage! The thunders clamour'd to the blast, the lightnings flash'd about, Like flaming brands by demons forged amidst that hellish rout; The proudest halls of Venice rock'd unto their very base, And mothers gazed in agony upon their children's face. Still eastward swept the sainted bark, and smote the billows back, Calm as the eagle floats along its cloud-beleaguer'd track; The whirlwind own'd the spirit-grasp of some superior sway, And, shrieking, vanish'd like a fiend defeated of its prey! Then gazed the aged fisherman upon the glorious three, And moved the helm with trembling hand, and marvell'd silently; For rays of light upon his sight in angel-beauty gleam'd From brows more eminently fair than poet's fancy dream'd! Now blacker vapours choked the breath, and sadder sights appear'd, As through the Adriatic strait the venturous vessel steer'd! A galley throng'd with demons foul was scudding o'er the wave, Which deeper grew, and faster flew, at every sign they gave! And horrid conjurations there, and curses long and wild, Doom'd to the last and worst despair, mother, and sire, and child! Devoted towers, and palaces, and temples, to that tide Whose dreadful billows leap'd around in their tempestuous pride! But lo! the sacred bark wore on, the galley shook with dread, The demons stretch'd their wings of flame, and howling, turn'd and fled! The horrors of that spectral sea at once were put to flight, As the morning stole, like a parting soul, from the grave of the buried night! Joy! joy for Venice!—fast and far the song of gladness flows; The grateful mother clasps her child, and half forgets her woes: The sea hath moan'd itself to sleep within the tranquil bay, And sunny is the welcome sky, and beautiful its ray! Now bid the voice of prayer arise, and wreathe the holy shrine, For shielded hath our city been by influence divine! Thanksgiving to the Virgin pour beside this hallow'd bark; And glory to St. Nicholas, St. George, and good St. Mark! THE ANGEL'S CALL. IN MEMORY OF JULIANA ANNE TAVARÉ. To the green grave newly made, Sisters come! To the churchyard where she's laid, Sisters come! When the ninth day downward dips Will the spirit leave her lips;— Bear her home! Earth and shroud may then be spared,— Angels have her house prepared,— Bear her home! She was purer than the morn, Sisters come! Spotless as a flower new born, Sisters come! All who saw her near could part 'Till her image fill'd each heart,— Bear her home! Never death kiss'd maiden's eyes Fitter for our Father's skies,— Bear her home! There is grief with her to part,— Sisters come! Anguish in the Mother's heart,— Sisters come! Teach the mourner's faith to rise To that Mansion in the skies, Where she's gone; Teach the Mother's lips to say, 'Mid the tears that must have way, Thy will be done! ALL THINGS FOR GOOD. Nothing we see, but is for good; No sight, no shape throughout creation, But hath, if rightly understood, Some wise and spiritual relation. Throughout all worlds, throughout all time, The outer of the inner telleth; Each seed is but a germ sublime, Where wisdom, love, and beauty dwelleth. And I can ne'er the thought forego That flowers, and trees, and all that groweth, Have sympathy with hearts below, And love the hand that love bestoweth. Who knows how link by link we draw The slender chain which life enforces?— A drop of dew may show some law, That guides the planets in their courses. Perchance the very sand we pass May teach a truth without our seeing; And e'en a simple blade of grass Proclaim the Universal Being. THE FLOWER SPIRIT. When earth was in its golden prime, Ere grief or gloom had marr'd its hue, And Paradise, unknown to crime, Beneath the love of angels grew, Each flower was then a spirit's home, Each tree a living shrine of song; And, oh! that ever hearts could roam— Could quit for sin that seraph throng! But there the spirit lingers yet, Though dimness o'er our visions fall; And flowers that seem with dewdrops wet Weep angel-tears for human thrall; And sentiments and feelings move The soul, like oracles divine; All hearts that ever bow'd to love First found it by the flowers' sweet shrine. A voiceless eloquence and power, Language that hath in life no sound Still haunts, like Truth, the Spirit-flower, And hallows even Sorrow's ground. The wanderer gives it Memory's tear, Whilst home seems pictured on its leaf; And hopes, and hearts, and voices dear, Come o'er him—beautiful as brief. 'Tis not the bloom, though wild or rare, It is the spirit power within, Which melts and moves our souls, to share The Paradise we here might win. For Heaven itself around us lies, Not far, not yet our reach beyond, And we are watch'd by angel's eyes, With hope and faith still fond! I well believe a spirit dwells Within the flower! least changed of all That of the pass'd Immortal tells— The glorious meeds before man's fall; Yet, still, though I should never see The mystic grace within it shine— Its essence is sublimity, Its feeling all divine. THE SHIP OF HEAVEN. A DREAM. 'Tis day, but sun or sky No human eye may see; Like a mighty shroud, the heavy air Hangs dim and drearily! 'Tis day—yet on the rock The falcon sits forlorn, Awaiting, cold and restlessly, The coming of the morn. A ray, as of the sun, Flashes along the deep, And, hark! dull whispers of the blast Through the old forest sweep. Yet all is calm, as lull'd By some magician's wand: It is no sun that lights the deep— No blast that sweeps the land! Like mountains that have been By ancient tempests riven, Opens in wild sublimity The lofty arch of heaven! The giant clouds dissolve Mysteriously away, As darkness melts to radiance Before the power of day. Innumerable beams Of variegated light Burst, from that everlasting sphere, Upon my trancéd sight. Temples of living fire, Mild as the lunar ray— Fountains that overflow with stars, Shine up the open way! Suddenly, from the vault, Like lightning when storms rave, A bow of atmospheric hues Spans the vast heaven and wave. A Ship!—a heavenly Ship!— Her sails are clouds of snow, Fine as the summer moon shines through, On pleasant eves below. From the miraculous cleft She takes her beauteous flight; And launching on the tide of air, Speeds down the waves of light. Gushes the trumpet's breath With organ melody;— And, at the sound, ten thousand shapes Spring from the groaning sea! The sea gives up its dead— Its brave, its honour'd dead; Their thronging footsteps press the deck, But soundless is their tread! The aged and wither'd brow, The stately and the fair, The warrior-knight and lowly hind— The prince and slave—meet there. They gaze on me, with eyes That evermore dilate, As if with the thin gelid air Engross'd—incorporate. Their forms glide, like star-rays Upon a rapid stream— Pale, shadowy, changeful—still in all Identical they seem! Again the Ship of Heaven Her wondrous path doth take; Silently she moves o'er the sea— Her vast stern leaves no wake! Vain is my wish to move: A ponderous column, bound With demon-chains upon my breast, Confines me to the ground. Vain is my hope to speak: Language denies the power To tell the bitter agony— The terror of this hour! 'Tis past!—back to my heart The fever'd blood springs, now, And the illusions of dark sleep Fast leave my aching brow! THE EVE OF ST. JOHN. She waiteth by the forest stream,— She sitteth on the ground; While the moonlight, like a mantle, Wraps her tenderly around! She sitteth through the cold, cold night, But not a step draws near, Though his name is on her trembling lips, His voice meets not her ear! Hist! was't the haunted stream that spoke? What droning sound swept there? She listens!—still no human tone O'erhears she anywhere!— Oh! was't the forest bough that took That sad and spectral mien? She looketh round distractedly, But there is nothing seen! Dark, in the quiet moonlight, Her shadowy form is thrown; With a strange and lonely mournfulness, It seems not like her own! She glanceth o'er her shoulder fair, The moon is gleaming wide; She turneth—Jesu! what is there Pale sitting by her side? She pauseth for a single breath— She hearkens for a tone; And terror pains her chilling veins, For breath or sound—is none! The silence—oh, it racks her brain, It binds it like a chord! She'd given worlds though but to hear The chirping of a bird! The shadow rose before her— It stood upon the stream: “O blessed shadow, ease my soul, And tell me 'tis a dream! Thou tak'st the form of one they vow'd Mine eyes should see no more!” The shadow stood across the stream, And beckon'd pale before. The shadow beckon'd on before, Yet deign'd her no reply; The ladye rose, and straight the stream To its pebbly breast was dry! It pass'd the wood—it cross'd the court— The gate flew from its chain— The gentle ladye knew she stood Within her own domain! And still the awful shadow glid, Without or breath or tone, Until it came to a sullen sluice 'Mid yellow sand and stone, But the rock and sand disdain'd to stand, The water scorn'd to flow; Thus blood was seen down the rift between, And the dead reveal'd below. The dead was seen, in the space between, And the ladye knew it well! She kiss'd its cheek with a piercing shriek, With a woe no tongue may tell, The gory shadow beckon'd on, And still her steps implored; But she follow'd not, for on that spot She found a shiver'd sword. She grasp'd the hilt—its silken thread Her own fair skill had wove; A brother's hand had struck the dead— His sword had slain her love! She took the corpse upon her knees, Its cheek lay next her own; Like sculpture fair, in the moonlight there, Like misery turn'd to stone! No food to seek for the raven's beak— The gibbet serves them true, With young, and sweet, and dainty meat, As e'er the ravens knew; And few they see near the gibbet-tree, For a bleeding form glides on, From the haunted stream, in the moon's cold beam, On the Eve of good Saint John! NOT TO-NIGHT. There's a shadow falling In the moonlit street; There's a fond voice calling, Calling low, and sweet: To and from the window, To and from the gate; Half resolved to enter, Half inclined to wait! While the chimes of midnight Float upon the gale; Thus the shadow passeth In the moonlight pale. Brightly in the cottage Burns the Christmas fire; Round its flame are seated Daughter, son, and sire: Oft a glance is centred On the casement pane; Oft a step is ventured, Then returns again. Still the shadow falleth, Still the moments go, Still that low voice calleth How to let him know! Two lights in the window, One light on the stair; Well the Watcher knoweth Wherefore they are there! Slowly—very slowly— 'Neath the moonlight ray, Passeth voice and shadow, From the path away: While the chimes of midnight Following still his feet, Whisper of the morrow, When they two may meet. THE TEMPLE. Know'st thou the temple of Song? The harps of all Nations are there The hymn, and the anthem, and song, God's voice and the music of prayer! The visions of ages surround That temple of beauty and grace; And the stream that encircles the ground Reflects in each wavelet a face! Know'st thou the temple of Song! Lov'st thou its banner of fame! Where is the being whose tongue Speaks not in praise of its name? While spirits with liberty glow— While hearts with affection are rife— The song of that temple shall flow, And its voice be the music of life. THE HEART. Oh, the Heart is a troublesome thing! Its fancies and follies are more Than the dews which fall round us in spring, Or the wind-beaten sands of the shore: Though fed upon kindness—it pines The moment you wander away; It is merry as long as Life shines— As long as Love smiles it is gay! Then pause ere you threaten to part, Reflect ere you bid it adieu; Ah! what can one do with a Heart So fond, yet so changeable, too? One moment inconstant and vain, Its follies the kindest would try; The next, if it see but your pain, To solace that pain it would die! Then oft it each feeling employs In seeking new ways to excel, And angels might envy the joys In the core of its being that dwell: So pause ere you threaten to part, Reflect ere you bid it adieu; Ah! what can one do with a Heart So fond, yet so changeable, too? THE CAPTIVE. There was joy in my home—there was beauty and light, For, fair as their mother first smiled on my sight, My daughters around me in innocence bloom'd, And my sons the free bearing of manhood assumed; While Christmas came round with mirth, music, and song, And their sire was the proudest of all that gay throng. But a sound filled the land with suspicion and dread, And the guiltless from home to a prison were led! From the arms of my children they tore me away, No anguish could move them—no mercy had they! And Christmas came round—but, ah! changed were its strains, To the clank of my fetters—to darkness and chains! And years crept away; still I hoped, as of yore, To behold my sweet home—kiss my children once more! Whilst a record of days midst the darkness I kept, I prayed to the God of the captive, and wept! Till memory grew wearied, and blighted its power, And Christmas came round, and I knew not the hour! Still years and years fled—no impression they gave; 'Twas a void, a delirium, a life in the grave— A chaos of thought—a dream, wild yet awake; But, alas! such a dream as no morning could break; And Christmas came round, but its brightness was o'er; It found not the captive, he knew it no more! At last, when the hairs on my temples were gray, When my form had grown feeble and bent with decay, The door of my cell grated open—for me! I was dragg'd into day and there told I was free! It was winter: the wind whistled cold o'er my brow; But methought it seem'd Christmas, and welcomed its snow! I was free! I beheld the glad sun once again; Though its light was but torture—its loveliness pain. I was free! I forgot the sad years that had roll'd; I forgot I was poor, and decrepid, and old! And methought that sweet Christmas again would appear In the home of my heart, with the beings most dear! I drew towards the spot where my home used to bloom; But its walls lay in dust, and my wife in the tomb! My daughters were scatter'd the wild waters wide, And my sons midst the wars for their country had died! So I turn'd to the dungeon, and craved for my chains, For the captive no home and no Christmas remains! EARTHLY BEAUTY. There was an angel loved the flowers, Who brought them dew from sainted springs; And came with heaven's own glowing hours Upon her white and sparkling wings; Then sat enamour'd all the morn, Lone gazing on her bower of bliss; For, oh! she thought Love's self was born In some sweet paradise like this. And all her fond affections grew In beauty round her flowery bands. That seem'd almost as if they knew Their buds were fed by angel hands. And thus she half forgot the sky, Such feeling warm'd her spirit fair! Till one by one they droop'd to die, And left the angel weeping there. “Alas!” she mourn'd, “who love could place— Who let the heart's affections rest On forms that have such heavenly grace, Yet fade away when loved the best? Alas! that beauty such as thine Should die, O Earth, and love deplore! From thee I wing my way divine, Where beauty blooms for evermore.” DESPONDENCY. Why thus cast down and grieved? Why anxious ever? Is boding Care believed, And sweet Hope never? Look, ere the day's amount Of woes confound thee,— Look up, sad heart, and count Thy friends around thee. Stars, which the Day conceals, Shine on unheeded; 'Tis only Night reveals How much they're needed! Is there no heavenly fount Whose dews have found thee? Look up, sad heart, and count God's blessings round thee. FAITHFUL AND FAITHLESS. A little knot of summer flowers Hung drooping o'er the streamlet side; But ah! the sear and sultry hours The shallow rippling stream had dried! So many a trust on earth is lost— So many a human friend deceives: The flow'rets found it to their cost, In wasted bloom and wither'd leaves. In vernal hope and love they grew, And, twined in one another, thought That whilst the breath of life they drew, The stream would feed them as it ought! And yet, alas! for earthly trust, For all reliances below, Their roots were pining in the dust, And still the stream no aid could show! But, like a blessing o'er the plain, The morn on wings of cloud descends; And fast and fresh the bounteous rain To every thirsting leaflet sends! Then woke the flowers to second birth; A second life to them was given: Oh, mortal, is thy trust on earth? Then change thy heart, and trust in Heaven! ANGELS. Though the beauty of Eden hath wither'd and fled, And Angels may visit Man's pathway no more; Oh, still o'er our lot is their influence shed, With a feeling as radiant and sweet as of yore! Yes; Angels, bright Angels, still hallow our sight, Still speak to our souls thro' the dreams of the night! Not fled, and for ever, the bloom of those days; A shadow of glory yet mantles our birth; For Seraphs smile over the child as he strays— And Heaven is beaming around us on Earth! Yes; Angels, bright Angels, still hallow our sight, Still speak to our souls thro' the dreams of the night! LOVE THEE? Love thee?—if thou wert but a song I'd learnt in earlier day, Thou ne'er shouldst leave my lips for long, Be from my thought away! No; thou shouldst be my theme at morn, My bird of love at noon; And I—the happiest lover born— Would let none list that tune! In every stream I'd hear thee, love, In every fountain-fall; The birds around, the stars above— Oh, thou shouldst live in all! The last sweet rose that dew might sip, In summer's fading breath, Should hear that song upon my lip, Companion sweet in death! If thou wert nothing but a voice In Memory's pensive ear, Still wouldst thou be my only choice— A sound for ever dear. But loving, blooming, all mine own, And all Life's bliss to prove, How couldst thou, in so sad a tone, E'er question if I love? MY LIFE WAS LIKE A FOUNTAIN. My life was like a fountain From Nature's heart that flows, And ripples down the mountain, Still singing as it goes; The flowers sprang all around it, The sun illumed its way: The lark's glad music found it And every wave was gay! My life was like a garden, Where Love would often roam; And Time sit down and tell me Of some ideal home!— Some home that true affection And youthful Hope might win; With roses climbing o'er it, And happy hearts within! My life was like a rainbow, That even out of storm Could gather tints of beauty, Some arch of hope to form! But now the fount hath taken A wider, darker shore; Love's garden is forsaken! Life's golden light is o'er. THE FALSE ONE. And it could please a vacant hour To woo him, win him, to thy side; Play with his heart as with a flower, Then change, and all his hopes deride: And it was triumph to impart Such woe as language ne'er exprest; Oh shame upon the cruel art Which thus could wound one human breast! Though thou wert beauteous as the ray That beam'd on Eden's bower of yore; Though thou wert . . . oh, away, away! May heart of man ne'er love thee more! Would that the angel-hand of Truth Might straight unveil thy syren brow; Disrobe thee of thy bloom of youth, And show thee false, as thou art now! We had been brothers in those years Ere life as yet had known a shade; And I could weep unmanly tears To see the wreck thy arts have made. But go!—assume thy gayest dress— Sport lightly with the pleasures nigh; Why shouldst thou wear one smile the less Because a breaking heart must die! WILL HE COME? The snow is falling deeply, The wintry winds blow drear, The gloomy day is waning, And yet he is not here! The old lamp in the casement But dimly throws its light; The way is wild and lonely— Do you think he'll come to-night? A step is on the snow-path, A hand is at the door; A voice—I know each whisper— And love it more and more: He comes—though dark the hill-side, And long its weary height: You know I never doubted, I said he'd come to-night. THE CAMP IS UP! The camp is up, 'tis break of day! The drums arousing beat, The signal trumpet's martial bray, The tramp of myriad feet, Still call me from thy last fond kiss, And all I deem divine! For, not in Heaven, where beauty is, Can be such charms as thine! 'Twas not the drum—'twas but the gale That beat the troubled air; The trumpet!—'twas the eagle's wail Above her rocky lair! But go—if fame be greater bliss, If honour brighter shine— I'll ask the stars what glory is, And that I'll say is thine! Though Morn's sweet breath doth bid us part, And earth and sky seem fair, Yet night, deep night, is in this heart— There is no morning there! But go—if over love and youth Still darkly fortune lowers, We'll ask the Angels what is truth, And that we'll say is ours! LITTLE THINGS. Do something for each other, Though small the help may be; There's comfort oft in little things, Far more than others see! It takes the sorrow from the eye, It leaves the world less bare, If but a friendly hand come nigh, When friendly hands are rare! Then cheer the hearts which toil each hour, Yet find it hard to live; And though but little's in our power, That little let us give. The poorest hand, if earnest, Some service may achieve; The humblest voice, if kindly, Some sorrow may relieve: We reck not how the aged poor Drag on from day to day, When e'en the little that they need Costs more than they can pay! Then cheer the hearts that toil each hour, Yet find it hard to live; And though but little's in our power That little let us give. SOIL OF ENGLAND. I bless thee, soil of England! Where'er thy power prevails; A grandeur robes thy greenwood— A glory crowns thy dales! Oh, place me wheresoe'er ye will, With but one sod of thine,— And Freedom's self shall hallow it, As 'twere her native shrine! And Eloquence shall wreathe that soil With England's proudest name; And Nelson's spirit start therefrom, In all its naval fame! A sound shall thrill that sod of Earth As swept a host to war; And Wellington's unconquer'd sword Gleam o'er it like a star! Yes; all that elevates the soul To things of higher worth; The genius of my Native Land Would grace that treasured Earth! I need no charm of mount or vale, No glimpse of England's sea— A shred of her immortal soil Is eloquent to me! THINKING OF OTHER DAYS. I was thinking of days, dearest Mary, When we met on those long summer eves, And the flowers took you, love, for some fairy, So lightly you tripp'd o'er their leaves! But now 'tis a mem'ry of sorrow, To muse over joys that are o'er; Though beauty may come with the morrow, There's a beauty it brings me no more! Where pleasure once smiled there is aching, Each month passes by like a year; And my heart if it be not now breaking. May break but too soon, Mary dear, Mary dear, May break but too soon, Mary dear. Since the hour, the sad hour, of thy leaving, The village has ne'er look'd the same; The flowers seem as if they were grieving, The winds as if sighing thy name! I roam through the ev'ning dejected, I call for a letter in vain; Each spot that thy fancy selected I wander again and again! Where pleasure once smiled there is aching, Each month passes by like a year, And my heart, if it be not now breaking, May break but too soon, Mary dear, Mary dear, May break but too soon, Mary dear. LET NOBODY KNOW. Ah! long is the light Of the warm summer day, And it's only at night One may venture away; But think when the shadow Falls dark from the tree, There is one near the meadow That's waiting for Thee: But although you may love me It secret must be, For no mortal must know You are waiting for me. The villagers all Are so fond of their talk; They'd jest for a month If they saw us two walk; They'd jest for a month And a something would find, If we even shook hands, Or but look'd the least kind; So whate'er they may guess, Or pretend they may see; Still let nobody know You are thinking of me. WAIT TILL I PUT ON MY BONNET. My father loves counting his cattle, My mother, she's fond of her chair, But I, oh! I dote upon moonlight, Sweet walks, and the soft quiet air; The field with the dew-star upon it, The scent of the newly-mown hay; Oh, wait till I put on my bonnet, Night's sweeter by far than the day! There are bonnets with ribbon and feather, But mine's like a gipsy's, so brown; A bonnet that's careless of weather, But happy's the head 'neath its crown. The day was intended for labour, But night was a gift to the heart; When neighbour might visit with neighbour, And love have its whisper apart: Then life finds a bloom still upon it, And time walks in silver array; Oh, wait till I put on my bonnet, Night's sweeter by far than the day! There are bonnets with ribbon and feather, But mine's like a gipsy's, so brown; A bonnet that's careless of weather, But happy's the head 'neath its crown. THE GARDEN STREAM. A stream that pass'd a garden side— A wild young stream, for ever singing— Where bloom'd a rose-tree in its pride, With crimson buds around it springing: Oh! tell me why the streamlet flows, With notes so sweet I fear to lose 'em? Is it because the blooming rose Is imaged on its tuneful bosom? Yes; Beauty fills the world with song! The stream's young wave had flow'd in sadness; For what is life, however long, Without the love which yields it gladness? What charm can make the hours so blest? What wing so fair hath so much fleetness? O Love! thine image in his breast, First fill'd the life of man with sweetness. THE HAND OF A FRIEND. Oh! Life's humble dwelling would seem indeed bare, If the bright rose of Friendship entwined not its door; And Misery's self would find residence there, If Friendship's glad voice might inspire it no more! Then, wherever the star of my destiny shine,— Whether pleasures await me, or perils attend,— Whilst one lingering pulse of existence is mine, Oh, give me the hand and the heart of a Friend! If sorrow sit dark on our spirit, what sound Like the footstep of Friendship to chase it afar? If danger surround us, still safety is found In the light and the guidance of Friendship's true star. Then, wherever the light of my destiny shine,— Whether pleasures await me, or perils attend,— Whilst one lingering pulse of existence is mine, Oh, give me the hand and the heart of a Friend! WIFE OF THE PIRATE. 'Gainst the rocky ribs of the rolling sea, The foundering vessel wore, And many a heart in agony Grew cold and palsied o'er, As rush'd the fate, which none might flee, Athwart that stormy shore! Still many a distant beacon threw Its friendly light in vain, And youthful eyes, to sorrow new, Gazed on in hopeless pain, As wild the foamy billows flew Along that dreadful main! Yet not more loving heart than thine, Joanna, sought that strand! Thy beacon, like affection's shrine, Shed brightness o'er the land, But none might light that stormy brine Save Heaven's almighty hand! Slow fled the weary hours of night, As they would never go; 'Till pale upon the topmost height Morn show'd her face of woe, As though she wept the bitter sight Of aching hearts below! Still Oscar came not—still no sail The distant waves display; But fast the morn grew calm and pale, The winds lull'd with the day, 'Till the last murmur of the gale Died slow and sad away! At length a lorn and shatter'd barque The night breeze swept ashore; 'Twas marvel how, amidst the dark, Without or mast or oar, It found the Pirate's rocky ark, Or saved the crew it bore! Joanna rush'd—she gain'd the place Where they the storm-boat cast— She rush'd to clasp in fond embrace Her loved—her lord—at last! And wild she gazed upon each face, 'Till every hope had past! Oh, Oscar! Oscar! where was he? A prisoner!—and alone! And they could leave him, thus to be In Wolfe's stern dungeon thrown! She heard—a shriek was on the sea Far wilder than its own! THE DAWN. 'Tis sweet when the twilight descends like a maiden, With star-sandall'd feet and cloud-mantle of gray; When the skies seem with grandeur and mystery laden, But there's nothing so sweet as the dawn of the day. Oh, if there's an hour to man's spirit appealing, An hour that can all his devotion repay, 'Tis when harmony, beauty, and grace are revealing Their charms at the dawn, the bright dawn of the day! For it beam'd on the birth of Eve's fairest of daughters, It woke the first breath of the lark's matin-lay; When the Spirit of God moved the face of the waters, All Eden lay blest in the dawn of the day. Though the Noon, like a monarch enthroned, may assemble His sun-banner'd hosts in their gorgeous array; Though the Moon may win hearts they are hearts that dissemble; For there's nothing so fair as the dawn of the day. The dawn of the day, when the old man is waking, World-weary and languid, bereft of each stay; When he turns to a dawn yet immortally breaking, The God-promised dawn of a heavenly day. Oh, if harmony, beauty, and freshness are blending Their charms for the dawn of our care-compass'd way, What bliss must be theirs who, through Jesus ascending, Behold with archangels the dawn of His day! VOYAGE OF LIFE. The golden sails of Thought, Fill'd with enchanted wind, Swept to the land they sought— Each shore and realm of mind! Youth sat the helm above, And mark'd each glorious trace— All beauty—feeling—love— All poetry and grace! The weary sails of Thought Were out upon the dark, 'Neath sky of storm inwrought, With, wild and wide, a spark: A star that might prevail To point where dangers heaved. 'Twas Manhood reef'd the sail, And mourn'd for Youth deceived. The shatter'd sails of Thought, All riven, went aground; No shore that Youth had sought, No port that Manhood found, Proved like that heaven which shone On golden sails of yore! No; Life's romance was gone! Youth's poetry was o'er! THE LONELY HOME. There's none to say “good night” to me— No friend my little fire to share; The old hoarse clock ticks drearily, And makes the silence worse to bear. Gone! all are gone!—the fondest, best, And loveliest that I call'd mine own: After brief suffering they're at rest; They—they lived not to wail alone! Alone, alone—morn, noon, and eve I see the cold chairs keep their place; I watch the dusty spider weave, Where once there shone a household grace. The brightness of my home is dull— The busy faces all are gone; I gaze—and oh! my heart is full— My aching heart, that breaks alone! I ope the Bible, gray with age— The same my hapless grandsire read; But tears stain fast and deep that page Which keeps their names—my loved—my dead! The wandering stranger by my door— The passing tread—the distant tone— All human sounds but deepen more The feeling I am lone—alone! My cot with mantling ivy green, Its pleasant porch, its sanded floor— Ah! Time's dread touch hath changed the scene, What was, alas! is now no more! The key hath rusted in the lock, So long since I the threshold cross'd: Why should I see the sun but mock The blessed light my home hath lost? Oh! would my last low bed were made! But Death forsakes the lone and old; Seeks the blithe cheek of youth to fade, To crush the gay, the strong, the bold. Yet sometimes through the long dull night, When hours find supernatural tone, I hear a promise of delight: Thou, God! Thou leav'st me not alone. The wintry rain fell dull and deep, As slow a coffin pass'd the road; No mourner there was seen to weep— No follower to that last abode! Yet there a broken heart found peace— The peace that but in death it knew! Alas! that human loves increase Our human woes and miseries too! WHICH HOME? Oh, none shall have a better home, Or brighter lot than thine! None richer dress wherein to roam, Or jewels more divine! Attendants gay shall lead the way, Where'er thy steps appear; And life shall be a dream of May— And May last all the year! A lofty home would suit me not; My heart would lonely be; And pine to gain its humble cot— Its humble friends to see! And oh, there's one—though far he's gone Across the severing wave; For whose dear sake, I'd die ere break The parting vow I gave! Should I, for gold, my faith withhold, And blight a heart so true, What proof have ye I should not be As false, ere long, to you? A gem more fair than queens can wear Is truth in woman's eye; That gem so dear, so sweet, sincere, I'll keep until I die! THE WORLDLY VOICE. Ye early Dews of Morn, Sweet wanderers from a bright and better sphere, Why weep ye o'er the rude leaf, worn and sere— Ye that in heaven were born? Oh, thou weak, spendthrift Rose, Why waste thine odours on the careless night? Exchanging perfume for unwholesome blight— Rubb'd by each wind that blows! Sad Ivy, quit this spot! Nor wander lorn by porch and abbey; Why o'er the dead must thy fond shadow fall? The Dead can serve thee not! “Peace, peace! thou Worldly Voice: The Dews of Morn have their brief mission given; Their part fulfill'd, they soar again to heaven, And bid new spheres rejoice.” “Be hush'd!” replied the Rose. “Like deeds by generous hearts in secret done, I glad the path of those the selfish shun, And lend what Heaven bestows!” “Oh, Voice from love debarr'd!” Rejoin'd the Ivy—“Voice the World respects— I love to shield the Worth which Pride neglects, And serve without reward! “Return, thou Voice, and prove One simple truth to calculating Man— Without reward, to do what good he can, Is God's first law of love!” Heard where'er life hath trod— Dew, Flower, and Leaf, that holy theme convey: Oh, what were Man, if Man would but obey Thee, Nature—and his God! NE'ER WILL I FORSAKE THEE, MOTHER. Ne'er will I forsake thee, mother, Dear thy closing life shall be; Never will I love another As my heart now loveth thee! Say'st thou that I speak but blindly? For its truth I here engage: Thou my youth hast nourish'd kindly, And I will console thine age! Live we for our own good only? Still receive yet nothing give? Shall I leave thee old and lonely? Never, mother, whilst I live! Still with thee I'll roam the wild wood, Still thy growing cares assuage; What thou wert unto my childhood, That I will be to thine age! A LAMENT. Go, number the clouds which the winds rend apart, Count the raindrops which fall o'er the desolate leaves; They are light to the sorrows that visit the heart, They are few to the tears which no solace relieves. Alas! for the man who devotedly twines Every chord of his heart round one object alone; Yet must watch o'er her life as it hourly declines, That life which is dearer by far than his own! Oh! teach me, great Nature, less feeling to keep; Strike the heart with some barrenness yet undescried: For affection is sorrow,—to love is to weep,— Man never placed fondness on aught—but it died! FIRST EMOTIONS. If to be wishful still to linger near thee, And in thy absence every moment tell— If when thou speak'st, it is new life to hear thee! If this be love—why, then, I love thee well. If to gaze on when unaware thou seemeth; Toying with hawk or hound, by rock or fell; Moving or lingering still like one that dreameth! If this be love—then do I love thee well! To deem him blest, who, as his own might claim thee, And round thy path be privileged to dwell; To be all tremor, if I hear one name thee!— If this be love—I love—and love thee well! THE DOOMED CITY. 'Twas midnight on the waveless sea, Which bathed the citadel; Over ocean and over land, The calm of slumber fell. A light dawn'd in the scowling west; A red and flashing light, Like a star—but it broader spread— It was no star of night. A spirit came rushing through sea and cloud, On wings of might it flew; And a glory over the soundless deep, Like a robe of lightning threw: Broader and broader spread that flame, As it swept to the shore more near; Earth and sky seem'd voiceless with awe, Before that thing of fear! A ship! I beheld her skeleton sides, And her deck with beings rife; Whose hearts through their fleshless ribs appear'd, Throbbing, and warm with life! A ship! a ship! like a meteor she pass'd, With ruin upon her speed; Her tatter'd sails, like dead men's shrouds, To the silent night were freed. There was not a wave on the sea, There was not a breath of air, Yet rapidly, rapidly sail'd that ship, As both wind and tide were there. It seem'd as some horrible spell, On my fear-fraught vision lay; Worlds I'd have given to quit that spot, Yet I could not turn away. There was one man gain'd the shore— And the earth grew black and rank— There was one wild rush of wind and wave, And the ship and her dread crew sank! Then swiftly I fled the city, In deep and fearful pain; And many dark months flew over my head, Ere I saw her proud towers again. Meanwhile Death had despoil'd her halls, Through her wide streets grass had grown; And of all her grace and majesty, Her strong towers remain'd alone. I saw the dead lying in heaps, The aged, the young, and the fair; I ask'd what that sight might mean, They told me the Plague had been there. They told me the night and hour When the pestilence first spread: I knew 'twas the night I had seen the ship; I knew 'twas the hour I had fled. And a curse came over that city, The strength of her towers fell low; And over the pride of her palaces, The dark waves of ocean flow. LOVE UNTOLD. My joy, yet grief! my rose, and yet my thorn! My soul's sweet day, and yet my spirit's night! While thou stand'st by, I sigh as one forlorn— Yet when afar, I languish for thy sight. Apart from thee, my heart can find no cheer, Yet starts with tremour when thy step is near! I dream of thee, yet lose thee in my dreams, And waking, ask of fate if this must be? The realm of feeling hath unnumber'd streams, And every stream but bears my thought to thee: Yet did thy form appear—my feet would stray, As if they loved thee not, another way! There is a constant fever in my breast, A something hoped, which dies when hope is given; A sweet delight, and yet a strange unrest; A thought that trembles betwixt earth and heaven. Would I loved less; or would the power were here To own my love—and triumph over fear! THE SNOW SHIP. Far within the Northern main, Belted thick with ice and snow, Fetter'd by a frozen chain, Many a fathom down below, Fix'd 'mid hills and vales of Frost, See a stately ship appears! Long amidst the glaciers lost— None may say how many years! Wildly gleams that ship of snow, Where the northern whirlwinds blow! Set with stars the slippery sail, Strung with gems each rope and line; Shimmering in the polar gale, Like some brilliant crystal mine. Arch o'erhanging arch, between Stands a solid bridge of glass, Midway earth and heaven seen, As for angel feet to pass Down to save that ship of snow, When the Arctic whirlwinds blow! Many a breaking heart was there, Lock'd within that realm of death; Many a long, imploring prayer Pass'd, with many a passing breath; Never yet might mortal tell Whom that fated vessel bore; Ocean keeps her secrets well, Deep and dark for evermore! Whilst the mast, like spire of snow, Points to heaven from human woe! THUS NATURE SPEAKS. Thus Nature speaks—thus, since the world began, Her spirit led the aspiring thought of man! Whether the Star of Science lit the way, And oped the gates of an immortal day, Or moved by Harmony's celestial hand, The poet's song first triumph'd o'er the land, It matters not—to Him be all the praise, Who spread this heaven of stars to human gaze; Lavish'd the wonders of Almighty thought Over that world His word in glory wrought: Who to the artist lent a spark divine, And said—“Behold, this beauteous earth is thine!” To Him should poetry uplift its gaze, To Him philosophy still utter praise; It matters not which first, which best, we find, If Truth exalt and Wisdom rule the mind. Let not contention jar man's fleeting hour, But give the praise to Him who gave the power! HYMN TO THE CROSS. Of the world-redeeming Cross, Hear, ye nations of the free, Where Atlantic billows toss, List, ye dwellers on the sea, For the mission of our Saviour hath pass'd; And hath scatter'd o'er the plain Its false temples, rent in twain, With their idol gods profane, Like the blast! In no chariot of cloud, With its whirlwind-wheels of flame, Whilst the conscious mountains bow'd, He, the great Messiah, came! But the meekest star of heaven shed its glow, And the leafless boughs did wave O'er the Mightiest to save,— O'er the Conqueror of the grave,— Sleeping low! He spoke—and demons fled From the vengeance of His word; And the wild graves of the dead Shrank and trembled as they heard, For the mystery of God was on His breath: Although priest and scribe denied, In the madness of their pride, What the gates of hell knew wide,— And deep Death. My Saviour is my song, Who the mount of faith hath rear'd; Who hath stricken down the strong, And the lost and lowly cheer'd; Descending like a dove upon their souls! When the orphan's wail was sore; And the wreck'd and wind-beat shore Heard the cry of those no more, Christ consoles. And they to whom the morn Brought no beauty—lent no light— At His touch their world was born: For their Jesus gave them sight; And the lame through the flow'ry meads could run; And the deaf, who never heard A fond mother's grateful word; And the dumb—sang like the bird To the sun! Yet He, the Son of God— That immortal blessings shed, Whilst the wilderness He trod— Knew not where to lay His head, Though the wild lynx and leopard had their lair. But the heavens bow'd, and came At a whisper of His Name; And sleep mantled His worn frame, Even there! The Eastern monarch lay Amid gold and purple bound, Whilst a myriad lamps, like day, Shed a summer softness round; And vassals throng'd in thousands at his tone. But the mockery that lies In rich gems and ophir dyes, When Jehovah opes the skies, Will be shown! As was prophesied of old, So its coming soon may be, When the arrogant and bold Shall grow weak o'er land and sea; And the conquest-shout of empire be unknown; The devouring sword no more, Nor war's arrows, drunk with gore, Scatter carnage, as of yore, For a throne! Wild shouts through Sion ran, Mid the zealot's scoff and gibe, When the “cursed” of God and man, Sold his Saviour for a bribe! Where the fatal tree frown'd dark 'neath the sky, As, all bruised and bound, they led Their Redeemer, blood to shed— The heavens veil'd their head Upon high! And the mighty mountains fell With an earthquake-voice of woe; And the buried rose to tell All the horror guilt must know; But, lightning-writ, it spoke where'er they trod: “Let the shuddering seas proclaim, And the hills, struck dark with shame, In their far depths own the name Of their God!” GOD HELP THE ORPHAN. God help the orphan, Homeless and desolate, Few to commiserate, God help the orphan! Sad to be brotherless, Woe to be motherless; God help the orphan! Thou, in whom love doth dwell, Deeper than tongue can tell; Help Thou the orphan! Fatherless none can be, Whilst in eternity Ruleth the Deity, None can be fatherless! Dews of Thy mercy shed On the poor orphan's head; Bid him still kneel to Thee, Look up to heaven, and see, Though those he loved are gone, Still there is ever One Feels for the fatherless! Blest be the Prayer Thou'st given, “Father, who art in heaven;” Oh, in our utmost need, Father art Thou indeed; Ever when lonely thus, Sending some friend to us; Soothing, consoling us; Thou, who art still the same, Thou, whom our prayers doth claim, “Hallowed be Thy Name,” God of the fatherless! Thou, whom all hearts doth hold, Touching with love the cold, Prompting sweet pity's tear, Ever in spirit near, Guarding each tender frame,— Bless'd be Thy holy Name, God of the fatherless! Still through all life may we Gratefully cling to Thee! Thou, who from Heaven thus Kindly hast given us Friends, that like parents feel, Watching the orphan's weal; Friends, who commiserate, Feel for the desolate: Friends Thine own hand hath given, “Father, who art in heaven;” Ever Thy Name we bless, God of the Fatherless, Guide of the Motherless, Help of the Orphan! LINES ON THE DEATH OF HENRY DRINKWATER BIRCH, AGED SEVEN YEARS. Oh! the lost—they leave life drear, Evermore—evermore: Nothing can restore That which made existence dear; Pass'd—like music on the ear— Evermore! With the angels evermore, Evermore! Darkness hath the soul o'erspread, Ever dark—ever dark; Lost Hope's latest spark: For the beautiful hath fled— And a shadow wraps the dead— Ever dark! But God's Word, to mourners said, Lights the dark!</field>
