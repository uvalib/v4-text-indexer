      <field name="fulltext">To the High and Mighty, OLIVER, By the grace of God, of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, with the Isles and Dominions thereof, Imperial PROTECTOR; as also, Catholike Defender of the oppressed Saints, throughout the World: Geo. Wither humbly offers, this Illustration of that supereminent TITLE. I know, that Malice will impute to me The guilt of Flatt'ry in a high degree: Yet, with a conscience blameless of that sin, Thus, in despight of Envie, I begin: LORD, of the noblest of all Soveraign Stiles, Of BRITAN's Empire, Provinces, and Isles: Bright Load-star of the North; who (for Director As well, through future times, as for PROTECTOR Of us who now survive) hast raised bin By Providence, that Great Work to begin, Which hath been long in hope; and which, henceforth Shall spread such Influences from the North Throughout the earth, as will their souls amaze, Who, on thy late Ascention, stand at gaze: Descend a little, and cast down thine eyes On this, which at thy feet displayed lyes; And, let thy great Humility, dispence With what, may seem in me a Confidence Above my Sphere: for, to the highest things, The lowest, otherwhiles, additions brings, If not obstructed by those dire Aspects, Which menace, now, malevolent Effects. Some days, before that Parliament was past, Which, may, yet, called be, your first, and last; This Poeme, (and the Lines which next ensue, To usher it) was fitted for your view, And, their perusal; who, might then have bin (As I supposed) much concern'd therein. But, somewhat intervening, which did seem To make it out of season, at that time, It was six months delay'd, to wait upon That subsequence which would ensue thereon And, now, a better Oportunity Appearing, This, in all humility, Moves toward you again, in ev'ry thing The same it was, except this prefacing, Which here concludes. Let the Contents be weigh'd, As they deserve: for, this, was that I said. I finde among the best Antiquities, That, they who rul'd the worlds chief Monarchies Gave those, whom they most favor'd, some New name: And, God himself, hath sometime done the same To his choice Favourites, when he begun Great Changes, and when signal acts were done, In order to a seas'nable proceed, With what, had been eternally decreed. Now, in like maner, for the same intent, He, by a New name, makes thee eminent, Above all other Princes, to bring on That Kingdom, which he promis'd long agon. And, to that end, YOU, (of whom no man thought In that way) from Obscurity are brought, To shew the world, That, he, ev'n to this day, Proceeds, with his own works, in his own way; Neither, her Pow'rs, in his Designments needing, Nor those great Persons, or that means, much heeding Which humane prudence, thinks, conducing to That, which eternal Wisdom means to do. And, he, perhaps, hath call'd me, from among The Vulgar, and most despicable Throng, To help rough-hew their hearts, who by dissentions, Are Foes to their own Peace, and his intentions: As also, to illustrate so to you, And, unto them, the Name conferred now; That, by observing it, both You, and They (Before it be too late) consider may How You, and They, are thereby priviledg'd; Whereto, you, joyntly, seem to be oblig'd; Whereto, apart; what, will succeed upon That, which shall well, or wickedly be done: And, that the time is come, or neer at hand, Which offers us, the means, to fall or stand. At least, I do believe, that I was born To act this Part; and will, till I return To him that sent me; leaving the success To Providence, which gets advantages By disadvantage; and, oft, makes our gains Then greatest, when most think, we lose our pains. I was about to tell you, what I hear; What, some suspect; what, many seem to fear; And, what most men repine at: But, your Sun Wants not my Candle, nor needs this be done: For, you have ev'rywhere, both Ears, and Eyes, To finde where Danger, or Advantage lyes; And, I can bring you, but a Gloworms light, Which rarely shines, except to them, whose Night Affliction darkens: And, it seems, ev'n then, An Ignis Fatuus, to some Prudent men. Till therefore, I shall finde my self more able, In your Concernments to be serviceable, I will in humble silence, wait upon What shall, by God, by You, and Those, be done Who represent these Nations; and, who be Objects of Contemplation now, to me, Whereby, I Calculate what may succeed, When, joyn'd together, I your Actings read: For, Truths, to me, your Trine-aspect more clears, Then all the Constellations of the Sphears: Yea, those Three shew me, what things will be done, Better, then all the Stars, the Moon, and Sun. There are some Clouds which trouble so my sight, That I discern not things, which else I might: But this I plainly view, that, much is left Unto Contingencie, to be bereft, Or else enjoy'd, according as you prove Who, in the two Inferiour Orbs, do move: And, if I know you, or, by what proceeds Either from Circumstances, Words, or Deeds, May know, what you unfeignedly desire, (And whereunto you chiefly do aspire) You aim at nothing more, then, to possess A Throne established by Righteousness: And that those Hesitations, and that Doubt, In which you let these Nations ravel out So many Months, is, neither ill Designe, Nor Evidence, that you from them decline: But, an Expedient, which, your wisdom tries To work by, in your late Emergencies. Unless, I be deceiv'd (which, God forbid) In what you do, and what you lately did, You, take no pleasure in delays, or troubles, Which, needlesly, their cost or labour doubles; But, onely, leave it to themselves, to state Their Questions, and, their heats to moderate, By their own Prudence, (without interposing Your judgement, or their purposes opposing) That, by a free debate, they fully may Know their own temper; and, you finde the way To such Resolvings, as may best assure A settlement of Peace, which will endure; And, that, when you, by their Contests have found Which Members rotten be, and which are sound; Who gives good counsel, who bad things infuses; Who speaks his Conscience, who his Trust abuses; Who strives to build up Truth, who pulls it down; Who neither stoops to smiles, nor fears a frown: Who merits to be stripped of his power, Who seeks his own ends, by pretending your; Who flatters, who is fickle, who is stout; Who fittest for the Work you are about; With other such discov'ries, that, from thence You may extract Results of Consequence For Common benefit: I do presume You will, at last, to that Conclusion come, Which all Good-men expect: and, act, what best Conduceth to the Publike Interest, Much better, then you either could have done, By interrupting, what seem'd carried on; Or, by possessing them with hopes, to have Whatever, they should pleased be, to crave: For, Full-fed Steeds grow wanton, if their Guiders Neglect the Rein; and, spoil themselves, and Riders. These are the thoughts, to which my heart inclines, Without a dictate of your own Designes From any hand: which thoughts, if you approve, I have, at this time, nothing more to move, But, that you will be pleased to peruse What of your Sov'raign Title now ensues; That, it may minde you of his love who gave it; Shew, on what terms, to what intent you have it; And keep you careful, that it be not changed; Lest, somewhat, from you, therewith be estranged, Which you are loth to lose, and, must forgo, When you grow disaffected thereunto: For, you will finde it so, when 't is too late To seek th'effects, which may be aimed at, By such an Innovation; and, will see Ill Consequences, which, yet hidden be, If (as I think you are not) I should finde Your Highness, to be mutably inclinde. I aim at nothing, but to make you strong For that Work, whereto seemeth to belong This, your advancement; and shall not desist Therein, although my private Interest You should neglect; or, value me no more Then they, who have opprest me heretofore. Believe this, Sir: for, from a heart it came, Which prompts no guile: and, be assur'd, I am (As unto him, who bears next under GOD Our Staff Protecting, or Correcting ROD) To your Highness, both faithfully, and conscientiously devoted, Geo. Wither. To the Readers. The Subject of my Muse, is now a TITLE; Which, though yet known unto the World but little, May much concern it: but, abov the rest, (And in the first place) Britain's Interest; If we destroy not, by a wilful sinning, The glory of it, in the first beginning. 'T is not my Principle, to take away, Or, to resist the Pow'r I should obey, Or, question that, which Providence approves, Or sets up, when another it removes; Confirming visibly, what it advances, With all the Supplements and Circumstances Which make a Pow'r: and therefore, when at first, Pow'r was dis-joynted, and I seem'd inforc'd To take one Part of what was then divided; I clave to that, wherewith, I thought resided Most Equity, adhering to the same With Constancie; and, I think, without blame Justly imputed: for, with an intent To serve as well the King, as Parliament, I put on Arms; and, as sincerely sought His good, as theirs, beneath whose Flag I fought, Till, I, betwixt them nigh destroy'd became; And, then, perceiving they were both to blame, Left off the Quarrel, unto Him, that knew Which best deserv'd, and, what to both was due. Yet, firm continu'd, to this Commonweal, When, by the Sword, GOD, answer'd her Appeal, According to our Laws, (which, in such case, Combate allows, when no proof else, takes place.) Yea, to the Peoples Representative, I, did (though thereby wrong'd) obedience give; Contributing, what I was able, then, With my Estate, and also by my Pen: Which, (though despised) somewhat did effect Producing more Advantage, then respect: For, they, who were not pleas'd it should be known To come from me, made my Designes their own; And left me to the mischief of their hate, Who, malic'd my Affection, to the State. When their Pow'r subdivided, I adher'd To that, in which most Righteousness appear'd: And, though I suffer'd still, without regard, (Aiming at nobler Guerdon, and reward, Then they could give me) did the best I could, Their Peace, and crazie Honour, to uphold By secret Cautions, and, by publishing What I much fear'd their course would on them bring: But, Selfness, Pride, and Avarice, made void All good endeavours, till they were destroy'd; And, some among them, who deserved well, Were wrapt up, in the Mischiefs which befel, Blam'd, and unpiti'd; yea, and most of all By them, whose wickedness, drew on their fall. How, it so came to pass, I, could not mark; For, in a Cloud 't was done, and in the dark, (As in respect of me) till, GOD reveal'd That Mystery, which was at first conceal'd: And then, from late Corruptions, forth did peep (As Eve from Adam, whilst he was asleep) Appearances; which, when they were reduc'd To their perfection, visibly produc'd The present Government, ere well I knew What men were doing, or, what would ensue. But, when it shew'd it self, I, plainly saw A Creature form'd, cloath'd with such Pow'r, and awe, That, none but GOD himself, could Author be Of that, which I did then produced see: Consid'ring, what Confusions we were in; What, might, much rather, have expected bin; And, how, to wonderment, he had asswag'd Their Fury, who, were Envious, and enrag'd. Therefore, although, before that time, I had Some Overtures, within my own heart made; And, some Expedients fancy'd, how to lay Foundations of our Peace, another way; And, to rebuild the Structure late o'erthrown, By gath'ring out, from what was pulled down, The Good, from Bad, (and that, which proved sound, From Rubbish, which therewith, was mixed found.) I threw by my own thoughts; and, thenceforth, sought To work on, in that Work, which GOD had wrought; And am resolv'd, with all the strength I have, (And, ev'ry Faculty which I receive) To fortifie that Pow'r, which rais'd I see, Till God himself removes it; though to me It prov'd less favourable, yea, and more Destructive, then the Pow'r, which raign'd before: And (without other purpose) to that end, These Musings, on this Title did intend, Which here ensues; that, you away may cast Your own Designes, as I did mine, at last, And joyn together, in advancing that New Pow'r, and Title, which, GOD, did create; Rather, then by a foolish wilfulness, Oppose his will, and ruine your own Peace. Which Mischief, that you timely may prevent, (And, not destructive Discord still foment) I have contriv'd this Engine, to prepare Their hearts for Concord, who divided are; And shew them, what Advantages may rise By that, which they through Ignorance despise. Consider therefore, duely, what it may Concern you, to take heed, of what I say; And, that sometime a Title, or a Word, (Scarce thought worth heed) occasion may afford Of furth'ring matters of great Consequence, And of removing things which gave offence. Consider what is offer'd to your view: Remember, that some things, and not a few, Which were foretold (ev'n many yeers before They came to pass) were carelesly pass'd ore, And what befel. Remember, that, to you I have nought tender'd, yet, which prov'd untrue, (If rightly understood) when 'twas profess'd Delib'rately, and, seriously express'd: And, let me finde respect, as I intend Your weal, by that, which now I recommend. Your ancient Remembrancer, Geo. Wither. The Protector. A Poem Briefly illustrating the Supereminency of that Dignity. Wise Providence, which, leaves unheeded, neither The falling hair, or wagging of a feather, Induceth me, somtimes, with serious eyes, To view, &amp; Muse on that, w?? most despise: And, now, amidst a world of Things, I am Thereby inclin'd, to Contemplate a Name; For which, perhaps, I shall be thought as wise, As he, who telleth Straws, or hunteth Flyes: But, think men as they list, my Thinkings, too, Shall be as free; and, what I please I'll do: For, now, of boundless Freedoms many dream; And, I may prove as wise, as one of them. A Factious Rout, because I much decline Their Principles, pretend, I fall from mine; And, falsly, say, that, I have taught my Rimes To soothe the Innovations of these Times: As if, a zeal to Publike good, none had, Until it made him, in some measure, mad, And partner in seditious ways, with those, Who, to the Present Pow'r, are always Foes. A Fawning Crew, because I bars provide Against their growing Vanities, and Pride, Have published, by Fame, (which is the Lyer) That, my last Lines, were voted to the fire: As if, Wise men, a blameful Act would do, Because, mis-jugding Fools, would have it so: But, I much value not, how I displease Such vain, and partial Censurers as these: For, having learn'd, that Knaves and Fools, are those Who, to my Musings, are still greatest Foes, I, now again adventure, maugre them, To descant on another Casual-Theame That's offered by the New Sprung Soveraign Style, Which lately was indeniz'd in this Isle: And, having found what Providence will do, There, where that Honour's, I will honour too; Not heeding, neither greatly taking care, Who thinks I temp'rize, or who angry are: This, was my temper known, when I was yonger; And, (as I older grow) it groweth stronger. Our needless Novelties, approve I not; Nor on Antiquities, did ever dote, Which are not useful; nor, is 't my intent To cavil, about things indifferent; But would have ev'ry Soul, preserv'd as free, As I my self, desirous am to be: And, therefore, when I have declar'd my minde, Let all men Censure, as they stand inclinde. Some, mis-advis'd, or, some deluded friends, (And, some, concealing mis-directed ends With fair Pretendings) would have laid aside This Title; and, his Highness dignifide, With what the Jews, imprudently, once, chose; Or, what the Germanes, on their CHIEF impose: Not heeding, peadventure, what Offence It had occasion'd, against Providence; Nor, of what Benefits, it may deprive Both Him, and Us, if their Designe should thrive. Therefore, I offer up this Vindication, Of what seems yet approv'd of by this Nation: Which, (though it may a Vanity appear, To those, who know not, what things proper are, Nor what is useful) shall, by what succeeds, Shew, how much, this Age these Expressions needs; And, have effects, which may to others be Of much advantage; though, of none to me. Did I not ghess at what our Eagle flyes, And to what Heights, I must advance mine eyes, To heed in what transcendent Sphere he goes; I might have sought him among Kites and Crows; And, call'd them by his Name; or, else, to Him, Communicated, what belongs to them, As others would have done; and, lost the view Of things that are, and, things that will ensue. Knew I not, also, that, to new Creations, There do belong peculiar Appellations, To keep things from Confusion; I, perchance, (Deluded by Self-love, or Ignorance, Yet blinding others) might have prized more Those Attributes, thought glorious heretofore; And been as violent, to have restor'd Those Titles, which the Vulgar have ador'd: For, I envie not, that men should bestow The highest Titles, where most Worth, they know. But, I heed, that, when Things and Names agree, And, that, when joyn'd by Providence they be, There's somewhat in it, of more Consequence Then all men, at first sight, collect from thence: Especially, when old Names, may obstruct Th'effects, which changing of a Name product, As in this present case; which, some, that have More Wit then Grace, do well enough perceive. Why, then, should we desire again that Thing, Which, formerly, these Nations call'd a King? Or, so much as the Name of that retain, To which, we long in bondage did remain? As if it had bewitch'd us, still, to bear Some mark of that, whereby inthral'd we were? And, which did by relapse (do what we could) Corrupt, still, into what it was of Old? Why should we court it now? whilst on us lies The heavie burthens, which their Tyrannies Occasion'd? and, before the wounds are cur'd, Which, we, in casting off those Chains, endur'd? Or, why on him who hath our Sov'reign Power, Should we bestow the Stile of Emperour? A drooping Title, shuffled off and on, Till it hath scarcely Place to rest upon, Or Person, which at this day owns the same, According to the Grandeur of that Name? If, they, who gave him first his Stile and Pow'r, That now protecteth, were his friends, and our, And, meant thereby to honour Us, and Him; Why, now should we their Noble Gift contemn? Why by the name of King, should we now call him, Which is below the Honours, that befall him; And makes him to be rather less, then greater, (As in himself) and rather worse then better As to his People? For, it renders voyd The Dignity conferr'd; and, now enjo'd. At best, it mixeth with it, but as Clay With Iron, which, both takes the strength away, And value of it: adding thereunto, Nothing, but what that structure may undo. It cracks the Instrument, which doth invest Him in his Pow'r; and lames his Interest: Yea, and disables him, to prosecute That Duty, whereto, it did him depute. It crosseth the designes of Providence. It will deprive him ev'n of that Defence Which seems intended; and, will him expose To all the purpos'd Cavils of his Foes. It wooes him from that Principle, whereon His Safety stands, to lean and rest upon A Pinacle, which totters under all, Who do ascend it; and, portends a Fall. In brief, it many ways, exposeth him To Dangers, which my sight (though somwhat dim) Better, it may be, can foresee, then some Who do supply a more perspicuous Room. It giveth shells for kernels; and, the shade Of that which he, before, in essence had. And, if by others flatt'ries, or, by ought, Which may to that end rise from his own thought, He waves this Title, for the best of those The World admires; he, therewithal hath chose His Portion in the world; and will, at last, Prove like to them, with whom his lot is cast. Some of the Long-robe, to advance their Trade, And others, that, an Inlet might be made To what they hope for (and, perhaps contrive In secret) our Old Title would revive; Because, from Kingship they have hope to draw Advantage by the letter of our Law, To all his Substitutes, who govern by That Name, sufficient to indempnify Them, both in their Estates, and Persons, from Those hazards, which might else upon them come; If, He, the Supreme Pow'r should repossess Whom GOD remov'd. But, neither more, nor less, Will they be priviledged, whether he King, or Protector, shall instiled be. Nor can a Name of novel Institution, Which in it self implies no diminution Of real Pow'r (but rather a supply) Diminish ought of his Authority That Rules in Chief; since, to him pertinent (Ev'n of due right) is all enablement That's necessary to effect those ends, Which Government, essentially intends. For, our PROTECTOR is not such a one, As that, whereby we did support the Throne, In Non-age of a King, (as some conceive) But, that, which to his Highness doth derive, As absolute, and as Supreme a Pow'r As that of Kingship, or of Emperour, Which arrogates no more, then may subsist, With GOD's, and with his People's Interest. And, be it known, (though some think otherwise) (Whose Judgement, we in many matters prize) That by a King, our Laws mean not alone, That Name, but, also that, which fills the Throne, Be it a King, a Queen, or Parliament, Or, whatsoever else, doth represent The Supreme Pow'r: And, that, each Attribute Or Priviledge, which Statute-laws impute To Pow'rs in being, when they first were made, Is (in each Change) with ev'ry force it had, Transferred thither, and, to that, wherein The Supreme Pow'r essentially is seen To act and to reside: (though in the Name, Or other Accidents, we change the fame.) For, to those Laws, although some violence Seem'd to be offer'd, in the lit'ral sence, When here a Woman raign'd; no wise-man thought The essence of the Laws transgress'd in ought, Because she was no King: nor will, of that, The Title of Protector ought abate. And, they, who may by rice distinguishings, Or Terms, impos'd indiff'rently one Things, Or Persons, be unwisely tempted from Realities; will much deceiv'd become In what they hope for: and, when thought they are Most safe, be taken in an unseen snare. When once a Supreme Pow'r is constituted, Submitted to, and shall be such reputed, Without resistance, or a Protestation Against it made in Publike, by that Nation Whom it concerns, (or by some part at least, Considerable, claiming Interest, Or share therein, having enablement Likewise to guard those, who thereto assent) Such Constitution, (and the Being, what It seems to be) gives it not onely that, But ev'ry other Right, which doth invest With real Pow'r; whether, it be exprest By Law, or not; and virtually makes void All Laws, whereby such Pow'r may be destroy'd; Until another Pow'r, that is more able, Removeth it: And, then, as warrantable That, thenceforth grows, as long, as it doth reign, And, actually, a Being doth retain. Provided, that such Pow'rs do neither swerve From Justice, nor destroy, what to preserve They were ordain'd; nor leave a private wrong Unrecompensed quite (or over-long) When they are forced to endamage some, That, many, may not to destruction come. And, all they, who to such a Pow'r submit, (Or, for the Common Peace, act under it) Whilst it continues, merit no just blame, Howe'er, that Pow'r, to be a Pow'r became; So they, at first, conspired not with those By whose unrighteous actings, it arose: For, GOD himself, commands us to obay The Pow'rs that are; not questioning what way They were acquir'd. His Son, whilst here on earth, He did reside, (although true King by birth) Paid Tribute to th'Usurper, that, he might Advance GODS work, by waving his own right. His Followers, taught this doctrine; yea, did teach By Practice, that which they by word did preach. And did submit for Conscience sake, ev'n when The Sov'raign Pow'r was grasp'd by worst of men, And got by basest means; which, to this day, Became a Guide, to many in that way, Which, else, had doubtful been: And, had we not This Rule to walk by, through GODS mercy got, Mankinde would be destroy'd: for, by our siding, With this, or with that Faction; by dividing, And subdividing Pow'rs, as Malice, Love. Pride, Envie, or Self-interest may move, All would be torn in pieces; and no Peace, Be setled, till Mankinde, to be, should cease. Why then should any so imprudent grow? Or rather, why so mad? (for they are so) Who, when they might unblamefully possess Their lives and portions, in safe Quietness, Will, unconstrained, lose their sweet enjoying Of what they have, and venture the destroying Of all that's dear unto them, to pull down A fixed Power? and, set up one unknown? That will be, or that may (at least) be worse? And, both on them, and others, bring the Curse Of All-devouring War? yea, and perchance, A Family, or Person, here advance, Who, either will not heed their services, Or else forget them, when they get their Prize? Or (which is worse) requite at last, with ill Their cost, their pains, their hazards, &amp; Good-will? And leave them to the spights and scorns of those Whom they, for their sakes, did at first oppose? For such things I have seen; ev'n Traytors made Their Favourites, whom they would have betray'd; And, those cast out of Favour, without Reason, Whose faithfulness, preserv'd them from their treason. Why then should we permit Discretions eyes To be deceiv'd with Cheating Fallacies? Why then should we of Scarcrows be afraid? Or on Foundations, by GODS own hand laid, Rebuild again old Babylon? or fix To Sion's firm stones, her untemper'd bricks? Why, when the work of God is both in Name, And in the Thing, of one Piece, and the same, Should Humane Policie presume to adde Her Trimmings? as if he mistaken had His purpose? Or, as if he had forgot What Title, best became the Pow'r and lot Which was conferr'd on him, to whom, of late, The Supreme Seat, it pleas'd him to translate, From those who had abus'd it? For, that Change (Although irregular it seem'd, and strange) Is not of Man, but GOD; though men have bin Dull, and imperfect Instruments therein: And, 't will establish'd be; if he that bears The Scepter shuns ungodly Counsellors; Makes not a wilful stand in sinners ways, Nor to the Scorners Throne, himself shall raise. But if this Title meerly did depend On humane prudence, we should much offend Against her Principles, by vary'ng from That Resolution whereto we are come. Why then should we, if now we Free-men are, (And by the world without, reputed were A world within our selves) be bound up to Their Customs, who have nought with us to do? Since, 't will be thereby tacitely confest, We are not Masters of that Interest Which we do claim; nor can of right create (As well as any other Supreme State) New Dignities; or make new, Presidents, When Time brings forth occasioned Events. For, this inferr'd, we granted, or believ'd, That, we our chief Ennoblements receiv'd From other States; and, are oblig'd become Those Rags of Honour, onely, to assume, Which they have worn though soyled and disgrac'd By those, on whom they were unjustly plac'd. A Title giveth no essential Fame; It is the Man, that dignifies the Name. Tyrant, was thought an honourable Stile, Until, Oppressors did the same defile. By lustful Insolence, in Tarquin's race, Kingship, at Rome, first fell into disgrace, And, 't was from thence exploded with such hate, That, though the King of Romanes, is of late, Made Titular; no Romane, to this day, Submits thereto, nor in Rome bears it sway. The Basis, of true Supreme honour stands Not upon absolute, but, Just Commands. A Prince, doth his Pre-eminence receive, From Vertue, not from his Appellative; And Righteousness, addes more to his renown, Then Conquest, Title, Scepter, and a Crown. As quickly will appear, when he shall want That Dignity, and grows exorbitant. An honourable Title is confest To be a fair Engagement, or at best, An useful Pledge, and some Memento too, Of what the Owner is oblig'd to do: But, of it self, on him that fills the place Of Pow'r, it doth confer, nor Worth, nor Grace. It is an Ornament, that priz'd should be, And, also, that which may, in some degree Illustrate him that wears it; if he frame His Actions answerable to the fame, According to the purposes of those, Who did on him, the Sov'raignty impose. And, that, which on our Chief hath been of late Conferr'd, (and is confirm'd now by our State) Is more significant, to that intent, Then All, whereof there's any President, Throughout the Universe; unless it be In some far Climate, yet unknown to me. To him, who hath obtain'd a Supreme Pow'r, Whether Duke, Prince, a King, or Emperour, Sophy, Grand Seignior, Pope, (or what Stile else We place on him, who, other men excels) He by the greatest of them, is possest Of no more Sov'raignty, then by the least. For, all their Titles are equivalent According to their Seigniories extent; Because, he that dependeth upon none, Is made as absolute, by any One Of those, or other Titles, as by all; Which will appear, when I discover shall How much, or little, each of them contains, Of that, which to Supremacie pertains; And, when it is considered what they are Who, as chief Soveraigns, these Titles, wear. A Duke, is but a Leader; supreme Prince, Is one who claims the chief Pre-eminence; A King, is he, who hath a Ruling Pow'r; Command, denominates an Emperour; Sophie (the Persian Title) signifies A Person, who, in governing is wise; Grand Seignior (which the Turks ambitiousness Now arrogates) doth Power in Chief express; The stile of Pope, implies a Fatherhood, And more relateth to a Peoples good, Then any of the former, though as little He doth conform his Actings to his Title: But, all those Titles want that which compleats A person meriting, the Supreme Seats, Except this last, whose Claimers (swerving from What their high Stile implieth) are become Stepfathers unto those, whom they pretend To father, foster, cherish, and defend; And, GOD as well for their Deliverance, As our, shall this Protectors pow'r advance, (Or his Successors) till it quite sets free All Nations, who, to them enslaved be; Avenging all the blood which they have shed; (The blood of Saints whom they have massacred Of late, or heretofore:) yea, look how far The Pow'rs of GOG, and MAGOG, stretched are; And wheresoe'er those Catholike pretenders Oppress; these shall be Catholike Defenders Of men oppressed; and, GOD, to that end, Shall universally this Pow'r extend. It hath already (as that Angel did, Of whom John wrote) to that intent, bestrid A great part of the world; and one foot stands upon the Seas, the other on the Lands. But, whither, do my Contemplations fly? I may, perchance, unseal a Mystery Before the time; my Muse, therefore, descend, And, prosecute the Subject I intend; Thereby, to further that, which I conceive Is drawing neer, and few will yet believe. None, of the other Titles, bring to minde All Duties, whereto Princes, are enjoyn'd; And, such as owe them, frequently are cast, Among the vile, and infamous, at last; Because, they nor essential retain Within themselves, the Pow'r those Titles fain, Nor any of those Vertues, which assure The Dignity, they formally procure. But, if, that any Title under heav'n, Hath in times past, or, in this age been giv'n, That, truely magnifies; and, may conduce To bring those Vertues, unto minde and use, Which dignifie the Persons; it is that Which Providence conferred hath of late, Upon our Governour. For, though it seem Through Novelty, not grown up to esteem, Yet, (if, unhappily, there be not wanting, Concomitances, useful to its planting) It will be reverenc'd, in farthest Climes, And, honourable through all future times, (Beyond compare;) when, Kings and Emperours Hav lost their Names, their Kingdoms, &amp; their Pow'rs: And, until here, that King of kings doth raign, Whose Glory, heav'n and earth, cannot contain. This glorious Title, hath in it exprest, No stamp of Self-relation, like the rest; But, marks forth One, (as if from heav'n sent down) Who seeks his Peoples weal, more then his own. It is the chiefest of GOD's Attributes Which he to those men, whom he here deputes Communicates; and ought, therefore, by none To be assum'd, but God-like men, alone, Who in their hearts, have purposed, to be (At least, by Imitation) such as He: And, ready, to contribute in his stead, Due succours to all Suppliants in their Need. It is a Name of mercy and affection, Which, not alone engageth to Protection, But, likewise to a strenuous Opposition Of Tyrants, Tyrannies, and all Oppression. For, to be call'd a Nation to protect, Implies (at least, in some degree) th'effect Of ev'ry Means, which may be helpful to Those Works which GOD provided Him to do; And nobler is, in that respect, then those Loud-sounding Titles, which our Fathers chose: Because, we therein comprehended finde More Notions, then in all those Titles joyn'd, Which are throughout the whole world, own'd by them, Who do enjoy a Sov'raign Diadem. Conduct, Pre-eminence, Rule, and Command, Policie, Grandeur, (both by Sea and Land) And, that Paternity, which they possess To whom is mis-imputed Holiness, Are but a Part, and that part very little Of what is intimated by this Title. For (being well consider'd) it implies That he, who owns it, should be truly wise, As well as politick; a foe to Vice; A friend to Vertue; free from Avarice. Awful of GOD; affectionate to Man, His Welfare seeking, by all means he can; Stout, and yet humble, in his Exaltation; Just, and his Justice, sweetning by Compassion; Due recompence to well-deservers giving; Pard'ning the Penitent, th'Opprest relieving; Watchful for all Occasions how he may Advance his Peoples welfare, ev'ry way: As also, by what means he may prevent The Common, and each private Detriment; A hearty Zelot of the Publike Faith; By Deeds confirming, what in Words he saith; And, readyer for his Flocks, his life to stake, Then, of their Flesh, or Fleece, a prey to make: Nor to his own alone, doth he extend His Goodness; but ev'n to the worlds far end, Will stretch it also; as acknowledging All men for Subjects of that Heav'nly King, Whom, he but represents; and, unto whom He must account, when Audit-day is come. And, of necessity, to all, he must Be righteous, who will to his own be just; Since, universal Justice, must make strong His Arm, who would defend his own from wrong; And, he who to this Vertue, is inclinde, Becomes, as well, a friend to all Mankinde As to his Native People, when they need Protection, and from Tyrants to be freed. This, is a true Protector; such a one As I desire, should ever fill the Throne Of these three Nations: And, if he prove such Who governs now, I'll never think it much To sacrifice my life, and all I have, His Person, Pow'r, and Dignity to save From his Maligners: whereas, if that he Who rul'd the whole world, were so kinde to me, As to advance me to the second place Within his Government; and when he was Remov'd by death, could, and would set me there Where he had sate; yet, if I certain were His heart stood not unfeignedly inclinde To do (as he enablement should finde) The duty of his place; I could not prize His Favours, nor his Greatness idolize, Not truely love him: yet, would still be true Unto his Pow'r, and give him all his due. This, a Protector is, according to The meaning of his Name. Thus, should he do. This, is that supereminent Degree, Whereto I strive, that he advanc'd should be Whom I inaugurate; and would hereby Transmit, to pass through all Posterity Among the Heroes, (whose wide-spreading Fames Make vulgar Appellations, and New-Names Grow honourable;) that, both far and neer, This Title, high exalted may appear; Until it hath attained an esteem Beyond all Attributes in former time. Room, therefore; and henceforth let Names of Pow'r, Such, as of Duke, King, Prince, or Emperour, Sophie, Grand Seignior; and that, which they own Who, claim the wearing of a Triple Crown, Descend; that in their place I may enthrone The Title of Protector, which in One Contains all, which, their Attributes afford; Yea, all the worlds grand Titles in one word: And, shall, by what it intimates, direct Till He, who these Dominions doth protect, Hath by example, taught, how to reduce All Governments to their intended use; Or, broke them into pieces, who, persist To tyrannize, and rant it, as they list. This, a Protector is, or ought to be; And, such a one as this, I hope, is He Who now reigns over us; although, as yet (To exercise our faith) GOD doth permit Some doubtings, and some few dissatisfactions; Because, we know not of his sev'ral Actions, The Grounds &amp; Reasons: which, were they so known To us, as those Designes, that are our own, Would make, perhaps, these Nations to believe They should that great Deliverance receive Which they expect; and, by his means, receive it, (If they could be perswaded to believe it.) At least, so far forth, as they justly can Expect so great a Blessing, by a Man Subject to Frailties; and, who did on him Assume that heavie Burthen, at that time Wherein, all things were to Confusion brought; And, wherein, Contrarieties were sought With so much violence, that, few, or none Knew what to crave, or what might best be done: When, for this Thing, one Faction madly bawl'd; When, for much diff'ring things, another call'd; A third, for somewhat, which would quite destroy What both the former, craved to enjoy. When some drew back; when, others on did hurry To their Designments, with a headstrong fury: When, most, each others purpose did mistake, Or, of best Meanings, worst Construction make, Through weakness, or by being prepossest With Pride, O'erweening, or Self-interest: And, when those Straights, and those Necessities, Which from the Pow'rs preceding, did arise, Did him to Arbitrary Acts enforce, That, things grown much amiss, might not grow worse. For, these things, make it difficult to know What, really he is; what he would do; Or, what he can do, whilst our sins and passions Foment our Strife; or, whilst Mis-applications, Mis-representings, or such-like, obstruct That Blessing, which GOD's mercy would product. If, likewise, we consider'd herewithal, That, when to this great Charge, he had this Call, It was, when our Unsetledness, had made it So hazardous, that none else would have had it; But such, as, probably, had, ere this day, Thereby, both to their own Designes made way, And, to our total Ruine: And, when, some Who did project, what now to pass is come, Did not, perhaps, intend so much, thereby, To raise him to a Supreme Dignity, As to ensnare him; and, to mount him to That eminence, in hope thereby to do His Adversaries work; and, him at length To weaken, by re-burth'ning him with strength. Were this consider'd; and, therewith, if we Well weigh'd, how great, yet, our Distempers be; And, what Necessity, and Prudence may Constrain him to, in that untrodden way, Wherein he marches; that, the Work begun, May not, dishonourably, now be done, Through want of Pow'r; and, bring a sad return Of Mischief, with an everlasting Scorn: We would believe, his Actions did produce, What, rather, praise required, then excuse. Yea, by this Observation, and by what We know well done, we would not judge of that We know not yet; and, (by what we discern, Without suspect) as perfectly might learn, How, by his Foot, a harmless Lamb to draw, As to describe a Lion, by his Paw. But, who can us assure, that for our sin, Mis-understandings have not raised bin 'Twixt him and us; whereby, GOD's wrath may bring Those Mischiefs back, we suffer'd by a King? And, make our Surgeon, put us to more pain, Then those late wounds, whereof we did complain? What Peace, can we expect, if for such Times He was prepar'd, in which loud-crying Crimes (Still unrepented of) will not afford, A milder way of Curing, then the Sword? Or what reproof deserves that Instrument, Who, then, acts that, for which, he forth was sent? If I, should here, those sins enumerate, Which are revived in this Land of late; Yea, and improved, much beyond the Crimes Which I took heed of in my yonger times: (And am perhaps preserved to be old, That, I, to some good purpose, might behold The works of GOD and Men; and, to this Nation Be serviceable in my Generation, For Future times:) It, plainly would appear, What, future Judgements, we might justly fear; And, that, it will be to my Maker's praise Hereafter, (although slighted in these days) To have it testified on record, How righteous he is still, in deed and word; How merciful, he to these Lands hath been; Ev'n when, we, him correcting us have seen: And, how, in Love, he still proceedeth on, Though, still, we do as ill, as we have done. Should I, illustrate those Prevarications, Those Vanities, and those Abominations, Which are increas'd, since here we did pretend A Reformation; and, how some offend By gross Extravagances, whose false Zeal To GOD, to Justice, &amp; this Commonweal Hath made them rich and great: how they could preach, And pray, till by pretendings, they did catch VVhat they had preach'd &amp; pray'd for; &amp;, how mute They are become, since they have reap'd the fruit Of their Designes: Should I, illustrate, how They counter-act their former actings, now, And fained Principles: with how much hast They follow them, whom their hands forth have cast, To all excess; and, how imprudently They do redintegrate, piece, and comply With those, that would destroy them; you, would dread, That, we deserved to be punished, More then our Predecessors; and, that He, Who should deliver us, our Scourge must be. Curs'd be their Comments, who shall this apply To Him, or Them, who in sincerity Did preach, or pray, or act, in order to What Providence instructed them to do, And was well done: But let this be applide, Onely to those, who swerved are aside From pious Principles, and sunk below Those Vertues, whereof, they had but the show. For, such there be; and, their Apostacies May, probably, prolong our Miseries. And, us, of that great happiness deprive, Which, we, by our Protector might receive. Should it prove so, how just soe'er he were, His Righteousness, would not to us appear; Nor is there possibility of Peace That will endure, till Wickedness decrease; Till Justice more be priz'd; more care be took Of Publike Faith; mens private faith, less broke; Oppressed men more pitied; succours pray'd, Not so much, and so needlesly, delay'd; Burthens, sustained for the preservation Of Publike weal, apportion'd in the Nation More equally; and, till men grow more wise, To see wherein the Common safety lies. For, till these things be done, what Humane pow'r Can save us from the Plagues which will devour? Who shall secure us? or, to what effect, Have we set up one Person to Protect, Or else to govern, or deliver us, From swift destruction, if it still be thus? What shall I say? what have we then to do, Save humbly to submit our selves unto Some Course, that may reform what is amiss; Whilst means thereof, and time afforded is; And seek, by true Contrition, to revoke The Doom, that GOD, may supersede the stroke. The thought of this, hath brought me to a Pause, And, my Inspirer, now, from me withdraws That Influence, whereby I should proceed, On my first Text. For, here, there may be need Of some Digression, to another strain; That, what is spoken, be not said in vain. Yea, here, (as in such Themes, it is my fashion) A few words more, of Use and Exhortation, Precaution, and Precation, I will adde; And, leave it unto those, for whom 'tis made; That, by the worst Events, which can befal, We may have Peace; and, God, the Praise of all. Let us be pleas'd his Pleasure should be done; And, for the time to come, let ev'ry one Be rather careful, his own ways to heed, Then fearful, how Another will proceed. Enough, we now our Brethren have opprest, Let us, henceforth, afford them, ease and rest; That, GOD, may give us Peace, and save us from That Bondage, which will, else, upon us come. Let those, who have occasioned the Cries Of men opprest, seek by a Sacrifice Of Righteousness, and both by Restitution Of Spoils, and willing Contribution, To take that Curse off, which on us is brought Through breach of Publike faith (nigh set at nought.) For, till that be endeavour'd, GOD will blast Our Counsels, and aside our Prayers cast; As we do theirs, who, grov'l at our feet, And, with sad Exclamations, fill the street. 'T is not the cheap Oblations of Thanksgivings, With much Hypocrisie, and Mis-believings Prophan'd; nor Formal Fastings, nor a Zeal Of setling this distracted Commonweal, For our own safety; which, will serve, alone, To expiate those Evils we have done: No, nor the fervour, wherewith we express Our Care of that Religion we profess; And, to explode all other, that will make Atonement for us, whilst the Rules we break Of Moral honestie: or, whilst we want That Love, which ought to be concomitant Therewith; and are not truely purg'd from that Which our Devotion, doth contaminate: For, undefil'd Religion, doth consist In succouring the Widow, the Opprest And Fatherless; of which, until we take More care, we, of our Faith, false boastings make: And, that Religion, which our Wits we strain To settle, will professed be in vain. Let us so labour, therefore, to enjoy Religious Truth, that, neither we destroy The Civil peace; nor, barb'rously neglect Morality; whose wilful dis-respect Destruction brings. To him, let us submit, Whom, GOD, hath rais'd up, on the Throne to sit. Let us conform, unto that Pow'r, which IS; Because, all Pow'rs that are, be onely His To whom all Thrones belong; whether he hath In love, vouchsafed it, or, in his wrath. For, unto whomsoever he commits That Pow'r; or, whoe'er, full dominion gets, They will be inexcusable, who shall Reject, whom GOD, investeth therewithal; Since, if they bring us Peace, we are too blame, If we, with them, comply not in the same, Or, help not to improve it; though, it more Should cost, then would have bought it heretofore. Though, with a Sword they come, let us obay, Till he who sent it, takes the same away; Who, as he rais'd them, ere we were aware, Will cast them down, when we least able are, If they transgress their bounds, and shall forget To what intent, they on their Thrones were set. Yea, when to us, no likelihood appears Of Freedom, or Deliv'rance from our Fears, GOD, will (ev'n when for us too strong they grow) By their own Pow'r, effect their overthrow. As upon those, who having heretofore Abus'd their Pow'r, are to be seen no more. And, no Good man, shall need, his hand to rear Against them: for, enough there always were, And are, and will be; whom, Revenge, Despight, Self-interests, or Envie, will incite To execute GOD's wrath: and, in their sin, When Tyrants rage, and hardned are therein, As Pharaoh was; such things as they despise (Ev'n Frogs and Caterpillers, Lice and Flyes) Will waste them: yea, their own vain Wit and Will Should ruine them, though all things else stood still; And, they themselves, Traytors enough would raise, (Complying with them, in their evil ways) To root them out: the Maggots which were bred By their rank Lusts, and by their Carrion fed, Shall eat them up. And, these signes will fore-run That Destiny, when their sad fall draws on. Projectors, Flatt'rers, and Buffoons, will then Finde more esteem, then good and sober men: Prudent advice, and timely-spoken Truth, Shall be despis'd: Rash unexperienc'd youth, Like Rehoboam's Counsel, shall be heard, And grave advice obtain but small regard: The Temporizer, who, himself inclines To humour and to further their Designes, Shall finde most favour; they, who faithful are To Publike Interest, they, more shall fear Then their known Foes; and, them out of their way Remove, or else destroy them, if they may. And (mark this well) when that's done, next of all, And quickly too, will follow their own fall. Be therefore, wise, ye Princes; Rulers, learn VVhat, may your weal and honour, most concern. Be careful, that, you sin not against Him, VVho, rais'd you, to a Sov'raign Diadem. As it becomes his Vice-roys, govern so, That, to the world, his Justice you may show, For propagation of that Kingdom, here, Which we expect; and, will ere long appear. And Thou, whose Title, here I celebrate; Thou, who, hast oportunity of that VVhich may to GOD and Men, most pleasing be; (And, hast the means thereof, confer'd on thee, First, and above all others;) lose thou not Those great advantages, which thou hast got, For all the proffers, which this world can make. To Sodom, or to Ægypt, look not back, Lest, thou be made a Monument of Salt To keep those, who come after, from thy fault; Or, leave thy bones, obscur'd, by desolation, VVithin the Wilderness of thy Probation. Thou, who art now, the worlds new Northern Star, Let, in thine Orb, no Course irregular (Oblique or Retrograde) divert thee from Those motions, which, thy Circle best become; Lest, from that Heav'n, in which thou now dost shine, Down to the Earth, thou back again decline. And, like the Star call'd Wormwood, bitter make Those waters, whence, we now refreshments take. Since, there are Constellations of some might, Whose motions, to thy Course, are opposite; Give no occasion of the sad effects, Which are portended, by their cross Aspects. Since, they, who love thee best, finde in thy way, Great Dangers; Fear much, for thee; watch &amp; pray: Oh! be not too secure; trust not upon What, may by humane Pow'r, or Wit be done: But, cleave to him, who rais'd thee to this hight; Yea, keeps thee on the Throne, in their despight: And, think thou hast great Cause, good heed to take, When, like a Man, thou hear'st an Ass to speak. If we expect a Blessing, let us, too, Without Hypocrisie, our duties do, To those in Pow'r: To him, partic'larly, That, over us, hath now the Sov'raignty; With true obedience, not in shew, or word, Ascribing, what our hearts do not afford: Nor let us seek, in secret, to deprive him, Of that, which openly we seem to give him: For, Falshood, shall be falsly dealt withal; And, Sand and Pebbles make as firm a wall In our defence, as either word, or deed, Which, from dissimulation, doth proceed. Let us not grudge at, what must make him able To do his Office, in an honourable And pow'rful way; left, that, which fails thereby, On our account, to our own loss, may lie. If, to that end, he seeks accommodations, He seeks them, for the honour of these Nations, As well as for his own; and, more, perchance, The Publike, then his private, to advance. And, what, too little, or too much will be To that end; he, may better know then we. If, in this late Establishment, he aims At Safety; 't is no more then Nature claims; And, to accept of less, then may, in reason Thereto suffice, were by misprision treason Against the Dignity, on him bestown, And, may betray our Safety, with his own. We, whose abodes, are on the Globe below, Some motions of the Stars above, may know: But, 't is impossible, that we should learn All things, which may their influence concern: And, 'tis not easie, for our eyes to heed What, they may be constrain'd to, in their need, Whose hands must tune so many diff'ring strings, And have, in charge, so many thousand things. Though, such as mark not, that Emergencies Oft happen; and, that, perils may arise (Unthought upon) which, will necessitate The Supreme Officer, of ev'ry State To act some things, which are not warrantable By their known Laws: yet, wise-men (who are able To see how far, they justly, then, may go Beyond Set Rules) do rationally know, That, Arbitrary Pow'r, in some degree, (And in some cases) must allowed be As if by Law expressed; or, that, all Earths Governments, would into pieces fall. And, this, is but that Pow'r, whereby we arm Each Private person, when a Common harm Is menaced: for, when a City burns, To save it, he pulls down, and overturns What, he thinks fit; and, takes away their right, From Some, that, All, may not be ruin'd quite. No less, should be his Pow'r, if need require, Who, may have otherwhile, a Gen'ral Fire To stop, or quench; by which, not onely, one, But, many Cities, may be quite undone: Yea, three great Nations; for whose good, I trust, He will improve it, and, appear as just As I believe him; and, bring all, at last, Into a right Course, when the danger's past. Whate'er he proveth; whether by his will Or Law he Rules; or, comes, for good or ill; Let all of us, o'er whom GOD gives him pow'r, Make conscience, that the fault be none of our. For, though that this Protector, is not he Whom long we look'd for; this was sent to be His Ways preparer; and, is, (though not that Supreme Protector) one, subordinate To him; and substituted for Probation, Both of himself, and of this Generation, In order to Christ's Empire; to break down Both our Self-confidences, and his own, As well as their, who have been mischievous Unto that Kingdom, which lies hid in us. Whereof, take heed, lest when you shall resist His Pow'r, you take a part with Antichrist; And, in the stead of setling Common peace, Our Publike Jars, and private Woes, increase. Heed, also, this; that, those Events, which shall Thereon succeed, are but conditional, To fail, or be effected, as, thereto Both Parties, shall conform, omit, or do: And, that this Title, likely to be made The most renown'd, that ever Mortal had, May, by Prevarications, fall below The vilest Names, that Malice can bestow; And, that, what, we to build up have presum'd, May, by a firy trial, be consum'd. Should it so prove, then, therewith mindful be, That, our works onely, would be lost; not we: And, that, we need not to despair or fear, (If, to a Right Foundation, we adhere) Whatever follows: for, best speed we shall, When, we are Nothing; and, GOD's All in All. But, should our North-star be remov'd from hence, Or, we deprived of his Influence By Counter-working Pow'rs, (which, to suspect I am not prone) I fear, that sad effect Will come to pass by some default of our; As, by our Envie, murm'ring at his Pow'r; Or, else, by some way, him provoking so, That, GOD may leave him, his own will, to do, For our just punishment; and, therewithal Permit him, through some Oversights, to fall Into such errors, or such negligences, As, on himself, may bring sad Consequences. Moses, the best and meekest of all men In his time living, and, perhaps, since then; By being, thus exasperated, lost The honor, to be Leader of GOD's Host Into their promis'd land; and, after all His glory, in the wilderness did fall: Thus, for like Provocations, GOD oft hath Set over Nations, RULERS, in his wrath; And, for some oversights, makes Kings, to share In those Corrections, wherewith scourg'd they are. Thus, heretofore, for Isr'els wickedness, King David, was permitted to transgress; And, thus, we, and our Chief, for what is ill, In us, may be joynt-suff'rers; yet, he, still Continue in Uprightness, as to that Which doth concern him, in his best Estate. For, though Detraction, raised by his Foes, (And, no less, by the Levity, of those Who, owe him love and duty) strives to vail His Worth; by shewing, wherein he doth fail Their expectations: yet, (for ought I see) His Actions hitherto, not onely be Unblameable, but also ought, at least By an acknowledgement, to be exprest (All things considered) with high applause, As bringing welfare as the Publike cause. And, therefore, though the nature of my Theme, Doth not invite me now, to speak of him, But, of his Title onely; And, though none Should give their Plaudits, till the Play be done; (Or, crown men, till the Coronation-day, Which is their last) yet, somewhat I will say To hint, in brief, what, more at large, I might Express, should I, a Panegyrick write: Yea, in despight of Envie, (though by him, I should no more be favour'd, then by them Who hate me) I'll with confidence aver, And, maugre Malice, make it to appear, That, if he had not often, great things done, Beyond meer humane hope, and far outgone All presidents of Senators, or Sages, Princes, or Captains, in preceding Ages, And all those, who had lately Supreme Pow'r, We had not been a Nation, at this hour, Enabled to subsist, within our dores; Or, from Invasion, to have kept our shores. Whereas, we now, are by the Sword of GOD, In this Protector's hand, bow'd to, abroad; In Peace at home; enabled to assist Our friends; emboldened, where we list, To spread our Sayls: The Envie grown, of those Who slighted us; made dreadful to our Foes; And, in so short time, that, the work was done Almost, as suddenly as 'twas begun. Nay, more then this, (if more then this, can be Atchiev'd for our advantage) it is He Who, was that happie Instrument, whereby GOD, sav'd us from a barb'rous Anarchie; And, from a Tyranny, which had, perhaps, Appear'd ere this, in many sev'ral shapes; And, may, yet, seize us, if Sin should deprive This Commonwealth, of her Preservative. This, is so evident, that I believe, His Enemies, my witness will receive; And, that a feigned Poem, in his praise, We need not, by Hyperboles, to raise; Or, by strain'd Metaphors, which, make him, more Envi'd then honor'd: And, the Cause wherefore I wave those Strains, is, lest, in stead of wat'ring Vertues, with modest Praises; I, by flatt'ring Might hap to drown them; and, destroy that end, Whereto, my rational endeavours tend. That, therefore, those good aims may be effected, Whereto, they are intentionally directed, Let us, with humble and true Self-denial, Submit to tarry out our days of trial; And, if some yet, among us, doubtful are Whether, by GOD, or men advanc'd he were, Let them, (as wise Gamaliel did advise) Wait, without off'ring force, what from success May be resolv'd: For, sure more dangers will Rise from resistance, then from sitting still. Joyntly let us assent, in carry'ng on That work, which GOD, appointeth to be done; And, not deprive our selves of real good, To settle an uncertain Likelihood: If there were Likelihood of any thing Which, we by other means, to pass might bring, Conducing more unto our happiness, Then, what the Course in act, yet promises. Let us recal, with due considerations, What, hath been long time suffer'd by these Nations, Through those destructive Discords, lately bred Betwixt the Peoples Trustees, and their Head; As also, 'twixt themselves: Let it be weigh'd, What Burthens were, thereby upon us laid, And, yet, lie heavie: Let the mournful cries, Of Families undone; the weeping eyes Of Childless mothers, and, the dying grones Of many Fathers, slaughter'd with their Sons, (And, Friends imbrued in each others gore By Civil Wars) make us consider more What, may again befal; and, by regard To what hath been, prevent, what afterward May follow, if that Quarrel should renew In which, our Swords, unhappily we drew; And, which, would now, upon a worse Account, Revive; and, to a worse result amount. Oh! think of these things with a serious thought, Before Repentance be too dearly bought: And, suffer not, our former countless cost, In treasure, blood, and labour, to be lost; But, rather with due thankfulness to heav'n, Enjoy in Peace, what, GOD hath left, or giv'n. Let, for the future, none of us repine At that, which hath by Providence divine Effected been; but, patiently attend Till, he, who hath begun, shall make an end: For, whether to our weal or w?o? improve, His ways are just, and all his works are love. Let us not change that Title which is given (For ought we know of) by decree from heav'n: Nor, let a looking backward, on those things Which time, and ripeness, to their Period brings, Obstruct one looking forward; as if nought For our avail, could possibly be wrought Save by that Pow'r, which once we idoliz'd, Until it grew to be as much despis'd, As honor'd heretofore; and mischievous Both to its own self-being, and to us. For, GOD, will have it known, that an Extent Is set to ev'ry State or Government; And, that there is no Kingdom, Pow'r, or Glory, But, His, alone, which is not transitory. We have dim Revelations, of some things By, and through whose imperfect glimmerings, We grope, and stumble onward, toward that Which we by faith and hope have aimed at; Slipping, sometimes, beside the safest path, Or, on each other falling soul, in wrath; Because, we, but in part, see, whereunto Our Courses tend, or what we ought to do. Yet, we are bound, according, to that Light To make our Progresses, with all our might; And, not distrust th'affection of our Guide, How weak a means soever he provide: For, when we finde our selves, quite in the dark, And, where Light-real, casteth forth, no spark, We must stand still; and, totally resigne Our selves, unto that Providence divine, Which governs all; lest, such false lights appear As those, wherewith, all men deluded are, Who, in such Streights, are tempted to despair; To murmur; or, their losses to repair, By wicked means; And, so, in hope to shun A Hazard, unto Deaths assured run. As our Affairs now stand, we seem, like those Whom, on both sides, high mountains did enclose Not to be climb'd; whose fore-right march was bar'd By Seas, through which, no hope of pass, appear'd: Who had behinde their backs a pow'rful Host By whose swift coming on, all means was lost Of safe Retreats: They could not downward dive; Nor knew they, how to get to heav'n alive: But, they a Moses, and an A'ron had, Who, lately, for them, had a passage made Through no less difficulties: yea, their GOD Did manifest among them his abode Ev'n in that Streight, and, forward, made them go, With safety, and triumphant honor too. Observe the Parallel: Divisions, here, Have raised Factions, which, like Mountains are On each hand straightning us: before our eyes, Much People, like the Red-sea, raging lies, And, murmuring, as if a Pass were sought, VVhereby, their Liberties, would come to nought: That Pharaoh, and his servants, from whose yoke, VVe are escap'd; encouragement have took To follow after us (as if, they thought Not Providence, but Chance, our freedom brought:) And, ev'n this Earth and Air, gives food and breath To those, that have with them conspir'd our death. Yet, we have still a Moses in our Camp; And, those, on whom, there doth appear the stamp Of A'rons sanctity; and, (which is more) God, still, with us, abides as heretofore. Why, should we then desist to trust upon His kindness, who so much for us hath done? Can we suspect, that he, whose mercy gave us A man impow'r'd, and qualifi'd to save us From our Oppressors; did intend that he Should make us presently his slaves to be? Did any grudge at Moses, whom he sent For their Deliverer; but such as went Down quick to hell? or, those whom he did slay With fire from heav'n, or, from earth took away By his immediate hand? Nay, when King Saul He in his wrath, up to the Throne did call, Were any then displeased therewithal, But wicked men, and sons of Belial? Oh! take good heed, whose Justice, you accuse; Whose Goodness, and whose Mercy you abuse. Be not, still faithless; but, on him depend, Whose loving kindness, hath nor change, nor end. Learn, but so well to know him, as you may, And, by that knowledge, you will finde the way To love him so, that you from thenceforth, shall With your estates, your bodies, souls, and all, Intrust him; and, admit of no suspect That, his Designes, can have an ill effect, Concerning you; or, that, the Pow'r, or failing, Of others, can obstruct your hopes prevailing. But, if you cannot, upon him rely, What, will you do? To whose help, would you fly? Affairs, will not succeed, as many dream. We are at such a loss, that things which seem To some, most likely, will not be effected, According to the mode they have projected: We see our old Foundations broken down; VVe see the Pow'rs we had, quite overthrown; VVe finde, that our own wisdom, is unable To counsel us; and, so unprofitable (Through Contradictions) that, it doth but add New fears, or jealousies, to those we had; And menace dangers, likely to be more Destructive, then our Troubles heretofore. The present time, is almost wholly spent A general Destruction, to prevent; And those men, by whose private Interest, The Publike strength, and safety doth subsist, Are without remedy expos'd the while, To sure, and irrecoverable spoil: VVhich, when this Commonwealth restor'd appears, VVill leave them, in their triumphs, little shares. VVould you return again, unto the Pow'r First laid aside? That, rather will devour Then bring us help: All, that this Island hath VVill not suffice to satisfie his wrath, VVith their Ambition, Avarice, and Lust, VVho, in, upon your Rights, with him, will thrust: Yea, many, who, now hope, they shall acquire Great things thereby, will perish in that fire; And, none of those, who think most safe to be Shall from the common mischief, then, be free. VVould you resume the Pow'r abolish'd, next? (VVhereby you were so many ways perplext?) Let it appear a Pow'r; and, we will, then, If it be Righteous, give it place agen. But it hath now no being: nor, was able To save it self, or to be profitable To others, whilst it raigned. VVe, have, now, An Image of it rais'd; but, who knows how It will comply with that, which raised it? And, if it shall not, what will then befit A prudent People? but, close to adhere To that, wherein, GOD's Pow'r shall most appear? What reason is there, we should doat so much On our Old Staff, new pieced with a Crutch, That, if it shall be forc'd out of our hand, We will, thenceforward, neither go, nor stand? But, Childlike, (who, if he a toy desire, Throws all his other play-games into fire When that's deny'd him) all our good destroy, Because, we may not somewhat more enjoy? Oh! heed this folly; and, be rather taught By Fools, then be Fools, and bring all to nought: For, GOD, by men and means, that most despise, Effects things, which the Prudence of the Wise, Doth but retard; and, where the means hath been Most weak; there, was his Pow'r and Love, most seen. Make not, unjust suspitions of a failing In others; to obstruct, your own prevailing. He, upon whom, GOD's Providence bestows The Supreme Pow'r, without all doubting, knows, Or may know, (yea, and shall know, late or soon, By some things past, or some things to be done) That, on his Good-behaviour, it is daign'd; And, could not possibly, be long sustain'd, If, He, should leave him, from whom, he derives His strength, his honour, and preservatives. He, hath observed, (if my information Be true) that an inherent inclination To Tyranny, is found in ev'ry one, That is advanced to a Sov'raign Throne, Which will corrupt him wholly, by degrees, Unless by Grace, that danger he foresees, With watchfulness; still, lab'ring to possess His Spirit, in perpetual humbleness, And, 'twixt his people, and himself, to make No difference, but, for his Callings sake. His wisdom, shews him what unstableness There is, in all, that he doth, yet possess: He, findes by this time, what it is to take The weight of three great Kingdoms on his back, What hazards he is in, as well by those Who, seem to be his friends, as by his foes: Yea, well enough he sees, what hardship stands, Before him, and what downfals at both hands; And, will not therefore, doubtless, be so mad (When an assured safety may be had) To live in danger; or, to blot the Story Which, hath so much recorded to his glory; By acting, or intending, what may turn His far-spread honour, to his future scorn. To trust him, therefore, why should we refuse Whom we did trust? and when we cannot chuse? Nay, when, by our distrust, we cannot shun Those Rocks, on which, we likely are to run? Or, what, adventures either He, or We (Since, in an equal hazard, both yet be) So both be safe; and, he hath pow'r to do That Work, which GOD hath called him unto, If, both, submit unto the frugal cost, Of yeelding Part, that All may not be lost? And, give unto each other, that, whereby Both may be strong, against an Enemy Which threatens both? and, who, may else destroy Both Parties, and possess what both enjoy? For, your Maligners, do the world surround; Have Snares above, and Engines under-ground; A Partie, both abroad, and here at home; As well in London, as in France and Rome: Spies, in your houses, watching what ye do; Yea, in your Chambers, and your Bosoms too: Nay more; they hope, if their close Plots do fail, That, they, by your mis-actings, may prevail, Through, their infusing that, into your brests Whereby they may advance their Interests; And, when their Pow'r, is quite infeebled grown, Cause you, to be destroyed by your own. Hear, and believe me, (who have oft foretold, What, some found true, though few regard it would) This, is design'd: yet, you may, ne'ertheless In safety be, if, by your wilfulness You let not Oportunities pass by, Which, now, are in your hand, and in your eye: An entrance into Rest, GOD, would now give, If, you, will in humility believe. Believe then: and, although you do not heed GOD's promises; believe, what he by deed Hath warranted, (with many gracious Pledges Thereof, vouchsafed in our Pilgrimages;) And hath, with signal wonders ratifide That, diffidence, withdraw us not aside. Those mercies passed, which fore-tokens were Of more to come, consider, as they are To be consider'd; lest, they aggravate Our sins, and, bring us to that sad estate Which we were in; and, wheel us back again To Ægypt, there, for ever, to remain. And, know this; (for, I nothing dare conceal, Which, now, my heart inclines me to reveal) That, they, who for Self-interest, enforce A final breach; (and, of so great a Curse; Needless occasions, wilfully do give) With Hypocrites, their Portion shall receive; Who, are the worst of sinners; and whose doom Is, to possess in Hell, the lowest room. Yea, know, if we unite not in the day VVherein, GOD offers Peace, (and, whilst we may) The time, will be but short, betwixt the Pow'r That, doth Protect; and, that, which will devour. But, LORD, prevent what's threatned; &amp; suppress That wicked Spirit of Contentiousness, VVhich now doth raign: and, though we merit not This Grace; yea, though, we have almost forgot VVhat Bondage we were in; what Rest we want; And, whereto, we are bound by Covenant; Save us! Oh, save us, in this present Crisis Of Good, and Ill, and, from our own Devices. Assist us, in performing our Conditions, That, thou mayst have the Praise of our fruitions, And, we, the Comfort; who, are at this day, Upon the verge of being cast away, Or of admission to that blessed Rest, In which consists, our noblest Interest. Let not th'enjoyment of a glorious Blessing, Now offer'd; (and, not far from our possessing) Be vacated by us, who, are to share The greatest part, in what thou wilt confer If thankfully received: Let not that High Title, wherewithal thou hast of late Thy servant honor'd, work effects on him Like those, which usually are found in them, VVho, seek themselves: nor, let Initiations, So far beyond our hopes, our expectations, And, former Presidents, be like the blaze Of Comets, which, a while amuse, amaze, Or some way chear beholders in the night Of their Afflictions, and, then, vanish quite. But, let them grow and rise, until they are Improv'd, into a glorious fixed Star. Let not my much unworthiness, by whom This Suit is made, a bar thereto become; Nor cause those, with the less effect to heed Those Cautions, which, I give them, now, to read. For, through an earthen trunk though 'tis exprest, (Or, by a Rams-horn-trumpet, at the best) Thy Spirit lent the breath, which gives the sound, And, will not let it be quite useless found; But make it pertinent unto their shame, Or to their honour, who shall hear the same. It tunes, a well-known Note; here's nothing spoke, In Riddles, which may doubtfully be took, As heretofore, when I was so inspir'd To speak, as our Condition, then, requir'd. These Counsels, though, a man unwise may give them, A wise man, without blushing, may receive them; And, he that sitteth in the highest place May heed them with more honor, then disgrace, If, he as well consider shall, from whom They may be sent, as by whose hand, they come. This, is a Piping, which the Babes who play VVithin the Market-place, soon practise may To dance unto; and, 'twill be well for them, If, now, their Fathers, do not so contemn This Musick, that hereafter, they begin In stead thereof, a bloody Matachin. For, though, these Warnings, come in that disguise VVhich Ignorance, and flouting Wits despise: And, is a kinde of Preaching, which these times Esteems no better, then of scurrile Rimes: This, will appear, one of those many ways, VVhereby, GOD, speaks unto these later days; And, which, if slighted, will be scor'd among Those Warnings, that, have been contemn'd, too long. A Recal to the Reader. My Poem's done; yet, prethee READER stay: I have another word or two, to say, VVherewith, before thou hence depart, I will These following leaves of empty paper fill: That, if it shall be possible, I might Once in my life, to thy advantage write, And, of my labour, view some fruit, before I, there am laid, where, I shall speak no more; And, that, those Truths, which I have oft, in vain, Spoke mildly, be not eccho'd forth again VVith dreadful Repetitions, unto those VVho, to my Charmes, their Adders ears now close; Or, scorn, and slight them, as fantastick dreams, Or, needless descants, upon trivial Theams. Having perus'd this, what art thou the better? Unless, thou finde arising from the Letter, That Spirit, which begot these words in me, The Soul of them, infusing into thee? VVith credit of their Truth, and with a sence Of that, eternal Love's, sweet influence, VVhich, for thy welfare, did my heart incline To pour forth my Affections, into thine? That, thou mightst, timely, take from hence occasion Of due resolvings, for thy preservation: For, on this fatal juncture of Affairs, Either thy Ruine, or else, thy Repairs Do now depend; and, will have an effect, According, as thy Course, thou shalt direct. What, wilt thou profit by it, if thou, still, Retainest a Perverseness in thy Will? How ill dost thou requite me, if, my Love No change in thy affections, hereby move? Since, I, desire no other recompence, But, that, thou mayst have benefit from hence? And, I, that small share, which a single one Hath in that good, which is to many done? And, with, how little comfort, shall I speak Another time, if, no effect, this take? What, had I thereby lost, if unexprest, These things, had still remained in my brest? Since, I had been, whilst they continu'd there, The same I am, now they divulged are? Or, what, by setting thus my heart at large, Gain I, except, my Consciences discharge, With some weak hopes, that, thou, and others, may Be benefited, by the words I say? Sure, none: Then, grudge me not that small effect, Which, from this Friendly service, I, expect By thy improvement; in which profit, thine Will be a Portion, far exceeding mine. If, for my sole Advantage, thou believe I, publish this; thy thinkings, thee deceive; Nor, Profit, or Protection, peace or praise Do I obtain, or look for, in these days By such Expressions; or, by Services Which are so little cared for, as these. Whilst many, sad Confusions on us lies; VVhilst, most men, their own safety do despise; And, when, few, any Cautions much regard, Save those, whereby, vain ends may be prefer'd; I shall, to this intent, prevail no more Then if I should endeavour, to out-rore The Windes and Seas. I have, now, yeer, by yeer, And almost day by day, attended there Full twice six yeers; where, was within one wall A perfect Representative of all Within this Isle, both at the best and worst; And I so well observ'd it, from the first, Ev'n to the last; and, by that Model, see So truely, what of those may judged be Whom they did represent, that I presume Gods providence constrain'd me to consume So many hours, to wait on them in vain, That, by such loss, I, better things might gain. What can be got by words? where sighs, &amp; grones, And tears, &amp; cries, move men no more then stones? When five, or ten, or twelve whole yeers delay Shall be no more consider'd then a day? And, when nor wants, nor justness of the Cause, Nor Importunitie, compassion draws; Or, where few Suits are brought to wished end But by a Bribe, or some corrupted friend? What, can be got by words, desir'd by none? When deeds, which, for the Publike weal were done, And, begg'd for, with a vowed Retribution, Have neither good respect, nor restitution? Where, serious Protestations, are forgot? Where promises, seem things intended not? And, when most men, resolved seem, to cherish Their wilfulness, although thereby, they perish? If, for my words, receive again, I may Respective words, I take it for large pay, And, 'twill enough content me, if my will To do thee good, be not repay'd with ill; Or, if I may but know, ere 't is too late, My hope, of what is justly aimed at, Shall be deny'd, with loss of no more cost, Or, time, then is thereon, already lost: For, such a mercy, many had preserv'd, Whom fruitless hopes have begger'd, yea, &amp; starv'd. If, thou suppose, I, gain, by what I write; Consider it, and thou such thoughts wilt slight. What profit is it, which, thence raise he may Who writes, and prints, and freely gives away At his own charge? and, doth expect no more, But, good acceptance, and the reading o'er? What gain I, else, for time and labour spent, But, to my face, perhaps, a Complement? And, sometimes, when my back is turn'd about, A secret sleight, or, else, an open flout? What Patronage, have I, yet thereby gained Through which, my cause, or person, is sustained? What favours, am I likely to obtain, Who flatter not the proud, nor sooth the vain? But, rather, venture Freedom, and Estate, Then, not to speak truth home; or, speak too late? So, need require it; so, my free expression Wrongs not the Common Peace, nor sound discretion, Nor Innocents; nor, those, who guilty are, Arraigneth anywhere, save at the Bar Of their own Consciences, by Writs, that come In gen'ral terms, and to I know not whom? If, thou conceive, that, I ambitious am Of Praise hereby; Thou, therein art too blame, What praise, from POETRY, can I expect, Which, findes an Epidemical neglect? Chiefly, from such as mine, upon such Theams As I oft chuse? and, when both winds and streams Against me are? and, also, in a time, When Poetry it self is thought a crime? When, they, who would reputed be, most holy, Look on it, as Prophaness, or meer folly? VVhen, they, you call the VVITS, all strains disgust That, sooth not vanitie, or stir up lust? Or, are not, with forc'd metaphors, and words (VVhose juncture, neither perfect sense affords, Nor any useful matter) sent abroad Drest, and trim'd up, in their affected mode? And, when the most part, are so ignorant, That, they, sufficient understanding want To read a Verse? and, put no difference 'Twixt best Composers, and that base non-sence VVhich, Pedlers, up and down the Country bring, And, Rogues and Whores about the City sing? Nor, is my Peace, or safety to be got Thereby; and, doubtless, if I know it not, I am a fool: for, I, have often lost My Freedom by it, with no little cost. He, that their Courses, constantly gainsays, VVho, Ahab-like, are wilful in their ways, From them, gets nothing, by his contradiction, But, Micah's bread and water of affliction. And, what on my Remembrancer, ensu'd, (VVhich, thousands in my time, fulfil'd have view'd) Informs me fully, what retaliation I, am to look for, from this Generation. VVho, then can think, that, he, who doth expose His thoughts, as I have done, to friends and foes, Amidst so many Factions? (when, but one He well can please, and, peradventure none?) VVho then, I say, can think, that outward rest VVas his chief aim? or, his own Interest The mark he shot at? or, that he shall ever Finde Peace external, whilst, he doth persever In such a Course? until, a change, GOD brings, As well in Manners, as in other things? Such, onely, hitherto, hath been my lot, That, I, in sixty six yeers have scarce got Six months together of that common Rest, VVhich is by many, all their life possest; And, now of late, unto what Side soe'er, Or, Principle, I truely did adhere: Some men of all Sides; ev'n of That, whose Cause Hath had my suffrages, pen, purse, applause, And faithful'st aid, hath brought as sad effects On me, by their despights, or disrespects, As pave all they, whose more deserved hate, My Pen, for their sakes, did exasperate. Nay; would it were no worse: By some of those, I suffer more, then, by our common Foes. VVhich, here, I mention, onely to prevent A false surmise; and, not in discontent: For, I, embrace my Portion, with thanks-giving, And, would not change it, with the best man living! To sum up all, and give thee my best pledge For my good meaning, in what I alledge; I hereby call to witness, Him, that knows VVhat, in my heart, I secretly propose, That, my chief purpose in divulging this, Is, to reform, those things which are amiss Both, in my self, and others: to make strong His hand, to whom this Title doth belong: And, to preserve that Peace, which, being lost, More then our lives, and our estates may cost. I look for nothing, but to be abus'd And, some way to be wrongfully accus'd By those whom this distastes, that, it may seem The less worth hearing, by my disesteem: And if his Vertue, who must break the blow Defend me not, I'm sure it will be so. I nothing seek on me to be bestown Save onely that, which is by right mine own; To disengage me from the world; wherein (And wherewith) I, unwarily have bin Too far, of late, engaged; and, from whom I cannot fairly disoblig'd become, VVithout a Retribution, of such things VVhich she hath lent; yea, which her promisings Embolden'd me to take; (and, which, she knows That, more then twice told, she unto me ows, Upon a just Account.) But, were I free, I hope she should not re-intangle me In ought, save what will visibly pertain More to the Publike, then my private gain. For, my ambition, is to live and die Henceforth, unheeded; and, retir'd to lie VVhere, I a little while, without annoy, My self, with my relations, may enjoy: And, then, resigne my place, to him, that must Supply it, when I slumber in the dust. But if this be too great an earthly bliss, For my enjoyment; yet I'm sure of this, That, I shall there be laid, ere it be long, VVhere, I shall have no sense of right or wrong; And, though I nothing have, rest quiet, there, VVhere, I shall also, neither want, nor care. This Postscript, READER, is on thee bestown, To rouze thy Spirit, and hold up mine own; (VVho, have enough to do, to keep my mind Close to that work, for which I was design'd, Amid those great temptations, and desertions VVhich set before me manifold diversions:) And, if, thou make me, now, no recompence, For this my Pains, by drawing profit hence Unto thy self; thou, wholly, wilt destroy, That, which I hereby hoped to enjoy, And, dost me wrong. To thee, thus much, to tell I had a minde: which being done, Farewel. Henceforth, say, or or gainsay; do, what ye will; (Let him, that's filthy, so continue still.) I've done my part, to make clean what was foul; I, to my pow'r, have here discharg'd my Soul, Of what it had in charge; and, on this string VVill strike no more: But for the future sing To GOD, and to my self, till they appear VVho come with eyes to see, and ears to hear.
