      <field name="fulltext">âMy soul lothed them, their soul also abhorred me.â âI was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth there are no reproofs. For in Thee, O Lord, do I hope: Thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.â âThere is a time to keep silence, and a time to speak.â TO THE EDITOR OF âTHE BRITISH BANNER.â I. EYE-SALVE. Oh foolish critic and unwise, Did you but know your Saviour, You'd surely see with other eyes, And change your whole behaviour: He talked of grass, and wind, and rain, And fig-trees, and fair weather, And made it His delight to bring Heaven and the earth together. He spoke of lilies, vines, and corn, The sparrow and the raven; And words so natural, yet so wise, Were on men's hearts engraven: And yeast, and bread, and flax, and cloth, And eggs, and fish, and candles; See! how the whole familiar world He most divinely handles. They called him âFellow,â and âThis man,â âDeceiver,â and a âDevil;â I'm sorry that you've learnt their plan, And fallen to their level: They trod His pearls beneath their feet, The doctors were the swine: But though their folly you repeat, His wisdom shall be mine. II. THE POET WARNED. Why do you quit your study chair, A student's proper post, Like an idolator to stare Upon the heavenly host? To sound and theologic men The stars are paltry spangles, Trinkets with which, at guilty night, The vain world idly dangles. Flowers, too, they are but tempting trash, Birds' song is empty twitter; You'll nothing learn but balderdash, In fields where daisies glitter: Go back into your study, go, Your maudlin fancies, curb 'em; Go, ponder o'er your Hebrew verb, âSat sapienti verbum.â When blue bells ring their wicked chime, Be wiser than to list, Or in a very little time, You may turn Pantheist; The wind-flowers then will bear away Your spirit far from church, And all alone, with Love Divine, Will leave you in the lurch. III. THE PHARISEE CHANGED. The Pharisee informed the Lord How good a life he led; The Publican shrunk back in shame, And smote his breast instead: But when the Lord, in tender love, The penitent commended, The hypocrite, with heart unchanged, Straightway his prayer amended. Said he, The man who says he's worst Is by the Lord thought best; So next when he to worship went, As Publican he drest, And smote upon his hollow heart, And bowed him down and groaned, And, proud of his humility, His unfelt sins he owned. The Publican, an altered man, Came, too, with lifted head, And joyfully gave thanks to God For the new life he led: The Lord again his offering took, Still spurned the Pharisee's, For sometimes tears and sometimes thanks, But only Truth can please. IV. INK AND DRINK. Once simple souls were fed on milk, The Church, she was a mother, Who opened first one fount of life, And opened then another: But now we all must live on ink, The milky streams are dry; Her bosom it was warm and soft, Our pens are hard and sly. All honour to the Press, but most Unto the Press Religious; Its blacking is so black that we Can only cryââProdigious!â By slang and slander, half and half, A polish fine is given, To black the seven-league boots in which Editors stride toâHeaven! Now simple souls are fed on ink, So grace is mostly gall; Now, like the drunkard for his glass, Saints for their âbittersâ call: Without their Hatred, as strong drink, These strong men can't exist, Love is but pap for little babe And sentimentalist. V. THE CRAWLING CRITIC. Suppose a creature on a head, That has no business there, With stealthy, irritating tread Should crawl from hair to hair; Of all the secrets of the brain What could that creature know, How learn the ecstacy and pain, That have their home below? Crawl, critic, down a ringlet crawl, And maiden virtue teach; Crawl, critic, over Samson's locks, His secret strength to reach: Crawl on the curly-pated child, And learn his innocence; Crawl on the grey-beard, and find out Experience and good sense. Crawl, critic, over every line That ever poet sang, You're still outside, you'll never know One secret joy or pang: Intruding, you may vex the skin With superficial pain; Profoundly far from you still lies The wise and feeling brain. VI. THE EDITOR MOUNTED. The British Lion has his fame, And shall it come to pass That none will urge another claim, And praise the British Ass? How long his ears, how loud his bray, Profoundly stupid he, And ever towards the proper way, His tail points faithfully. But let him on the Church lands feed, And see around him bristle, In crops luxuriant and profuse, The old five-pointed thistle, And then you will convert him to An ass of noblest mettle; And problems no man's head can solve, His heels will swiftly settle. No argument can make him stir, Howe'er you poke and thwack; But let the British Editor But mount upon his back; His ears he lifts, his heels he flings, And headlong flies away, Smashing through truth and decency With a triumphant bray. VII. A NEW PLAN. With Doddridge, Watts, and Cowper too, Whoe'er casts in his lot, Presuming for the Church to sing, We'll let him know what's what: Of better hymns than we deserve We've quite enough provided; And no man now shall innovate, On that we're most decided. 'Twas said, Be kind as silly doves, Wise as the cruel snake; Each creature's evil leave behind, It's excellency take: But that won't do for times like these, Heretical and loose; We need the venom of the worm, The folly of the goose. We'll peck, and bite, and sting, and scratch, And hoot, and hiss, and bellow; Till we have purified the Church Of every quiet fellow: If any one complain and frown, Then this is our apology, We must by all means bluster down The Negative Theology. VIII. A NEGATIVE AFFAIR. When sugar in the lump I see, I know that it is there, Melt it, and then I soon suspect A negative affair: Where is the sugar, Sir? I say, Let me both touch and see; Sweetness instead of sugar, Sir, You'll not palm off on me. Don't tell me that the sugar-lumps, When dropt in water clear, That they may make the water sweet, Themselves must disappear; For common sense, Sir, such as mine, The lumps themselves must see; Sweetness instead of sugar, Sir, You'll not palm off on me. For instance, Sir, in every hymn Sound doctrine you should state As clearly as a dead man's name Is on his coffin plate: Religion, Sir, is only fudge, Let's have theology; Sweetness instead of sugar, Sir, You'll not palm off on me. IX. EGG-SHELL. Without an egg-shell, you'll observe, Cannot an egg be laid; The shell should therefore ever be Of prime importance made; And if you breakfast on the egg, And cast aside the shell, A candid man will hardly say That such a course is well. And how can Truth be taught without A form of words to guard it? If once, then, you have got the form, Beware how you discard it: To get at truth, if ever forms Be tampered with and broke, It is as if you cracked the shell That you might eat the yolk. There's not a bit of shell, we fear, In all this writer's hymns; But like the yolk of egg in wine, In verse his doctrine swims: He gives us egg without the shell; When next he writes, we beg He'll give us, what we'd much prefer, The shell without the egg. X. DEAD THINGS BEST. Why at the âspiritâ and the âscopeâ Should boggling poets stick? Each text was given as a rope To hang a heretic: The Scripture is for ever fixt Like corpse upon a table, How rightly to dissect the Word Would doctors else be able? The âspiritâ is a dangerous power, Far safer is the âletter;â A living lion might devour, A dead one is much better: Come, âcut him upâ and peepâbut oh! Suppose you were detected? If suddenly from sleep he springs, Perhaps you'll be dissected. Oh why will man still crave for life, Howe'er we warn and chide him, Why want a living steed although Such trouble 'tis to ride him: Why should we ride till we are sore, On miry ways and sandy, A rocking-horse on parlour floor Is far more clean and handy? XI. COURTS CONFIDENTIAL. An open court, full in the glare Of the great public eye, Can never be the proper place A heretic to try: When holy men in conclave meet, There's one thing most essential; They must upon a footing treat, Entirely confidential. The public eye will sometimes flash With keen indignant glances That through ecclesiastic nerves Would run like fiery lances: The Churchman to the Public says, Where, Sir, is your credential? Pray don't intrude in an affair Entirely confidential. The Pillory may public be, But private, Sir, the trial; Or heretics might every charge Rebut with firm denial; Convict the orthodox of sin By arguments potential:â The court must be for us to win, Entirely confidential. XII. ORTHODOXY. Pray are you wise, Sir? No, but I Much wiser wish to be; But perfect wisdom I disclaim With all humility. And are you orthodox? Oh, yes, None more so can be found, I've some regard to character, And hate a man unsound. But if you're only sound asleep, And some one else awaking, And, seeing that the sun is up, Gives you a friendly shaking; Though you may call him heretic, He proves himself the wiser, For evermore Truth's best success Comes through the earliest riser. If orthodoxy soundness be In thought, and act, and word, Of any man quite orthodox Whoever yet has heard? All such pretences Wisdom mocks As gravely she replies, There's only One that's orthodox, He who alone is wise. XIII. COBWEB. There is a New Commandment which New hearts alone can keep; Its fruits, a new earth and new heaven Will with a new song reap: And when this new command is kept, With new eyes shall we see New things of every kind, except A New Theology? Ecclesiastics, spider-like, On Jesus Christ the Door Have spun their cobwebs fine until They've darkly closed him o'er: They catch the souls that come to Him, They seize them for a prey; Oh blessed hour, Oh happy man, That sweeps their webs away. And webs that any man may break May many men repel, And why should Heaven's door look as dark As if it led to Hell? Perhaps this New Theology Has come to do no more Than sweep the cobwebs all away From Jesus Christ the Door. XIV. VOICES VICTORIOUS. You often tell us Jesus died, But not that voices killed Him; Voices of men whose rage and pride Abhorred the love that filled Him: I find no fault, the Roman said, Yet have I not two choices; 'Twere folly to withstand a crowd, All urgent with loud voices. Away with Him, away, they cry, His words were wont to stab us; He's guilty of worse robbery Than ever was Barabbas: He smote our rabbis through the shield Of their phylacteries; He stole away the people's hearts, We hate him, and he dies. When thus the billowy voices swell, Let prudent men reflect; Some victim must the tumult quell, Or we shall all be wreckt: Let Churches, then, be worldly wise, And, anxious for a calm, Be ready Christ to sacrifice, To save themselves from harm. XV. THE WAY AND THE END. Oh Thou who only art the End, Thou art the only Way; And in our suffering Master's track, Through many a weary day I've journeyed on and oft have said, Enough, Lord, let me die; But quickly Thou hast answered me, Fear not, my help is nigh. How long, Oh Lord, Oh Lord the End, Wilt Thou be but a Way? Frail, sinful men my fathers were, Not better I than they: Oh take me to Thyself, I said, Enough, Lord, let me die; But Thou again hast answered me, Fear not, my help is nigh. Shall I, who choose Thee for the End, Refuse Thee as the Way? Thou, too, wast watched by evil eyes, Men sought Thee for their prey: I'm weary of the strife, I said, Enough, Lord, let me die; But Thou once more hast answered me, Fear not, my help is nigh.NOTE. The term âfaith,â which occurs, as has been said, twenty-two times in the âRivulet,â is in several hymns used more than once. It is found in fifteen hymns, which hereby protest once more against wrong. Crying, âWrong charged and right pleaded,â they shall now confront Dr. Campbell one by one. As, however, he has not honestly read the book, I shall not tell him which hymns they are, but leave him to find out, if he likes. No. 1 affirms that they who enlist in the Lord's service must do so in faith, calm mid tumult, confident in hope. No. 2 teaches us that when faith wrestles hardest it triumphs most, recognising Divine love amid the darkest troubles. No. 3 affirms that âfaithâ in the Lord Jesus Christ will ease us from fear. In No. 4, the âtermâ occurs twice, and it is taught that when we are at our wit's end there may be the beginning of new faith, and that skill, aided by such faith, will avail greatly. No. 5 tells us that holy men âstood by faith,â that by faith first vanquishing their fears, they could then meet their foes, and that faith in adversities is still conqueror, because it denies that things are as they seem. In this one hymn the term occurs three times. No. 6 teaches us that till men have a common faith in God, they will not have a common enjoyment of His bounties. No. 7 contains the âtermâ four times. It compares faith to a staff and a sword, sets forth Christ our captain and our guide as the object of our trust, and entreats for the Spirit of Christ that we may lean on our faith as a staff, and wield it against falsehood as a sword. No. 8 speaks of the house of the wise man as the house of obedient faith. No. 9 teaches that though craft and force unite to wrong us, yet if we read the Saviour's story with faith, we shall not doubt the issue. No. 10 says that when deceiving sin and worldly fears defy the faith that rules inwardly, we cry to God to save us from estranging error, our chief fear being lest we should be seduced from Him. No. 11 tells us that though the world is new every hour, faith and love are old as well as new, and that we must be wise in what is old if we would win new glory, and that men of faith in the old time were mighty because their soul was open to receive God. In this hymn the âtermâ occurs twice. No. 12 prays that through patience faith may be confirmed and love proved. No. 13 says that only the heart that has faith can, like a strong bird, face the gale, ascending, and singing as it rises. No. 14 contains a cry to God for vigour to press onward in faith upon Him whose perfection pleads for ours, and through whose resurrection we rise. No. 15 expresses the wonder the soul sometimes feels at former faith, and utters a prayer against waywardness, and that, faithful to the inward light, it may become calm always. In this hymn faithful as well as faith occurs. And it occurs again. One of Dr. Campbell's three instances of the term faith is actually the term believes. Why, if the term believes and other relative terms may be taken, the case against the Doctor may be made much stronger! He has sinned against Mr. Lynch. A saint would repent with shame and grief. Will Dr. Campbell?</field>
