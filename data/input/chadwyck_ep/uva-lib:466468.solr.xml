      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD CLONCURRY, AS A SMALL TRIBUTE OF THE AUTHOR'S ADMIRATION OF HIS LORDSHIP'S PUBLIC SPIRIT AND LOVE OF COUNTRY, THE FOLLOWING POEM IS MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CELT'S PARADISE. FIRST DUAN. OSSIAN. Man of prayers, lead me forth From our silent cell of care, The morning-breeze to me is worth All thy hymns and all thy prayerâ For dark and loncly have we prayedâ Our psalms are sung, our penance saidâ Thou hast told me, I am forgiven, And I long to live in the smile of heaven. I cannot see the holy light, But I feel it on my brow of whiteâ I cannot see the young bird soaring, But I hear the song his pride is pouringâ I cannot see the laughing water, Nor the fresh beauty the sun has brought her; I only hear the moan she is making, Over her bed of pebbles breaking. Man of prayers, lead me onâ Lead the son of Comhal's son, To the hill where his early deeds were doneâ Lead me to Slieve Gullian's breast, And give me there my mournful rest. Ossian longs to lie alone, And think of days and dangers goneâ The darkened soul of Ossian longs To float on the stream of other songs Than those thy altar bells are ringing, And thy white-robed Culdees singing. This is the placeâI know it now, I feel its freshness on my brow! Lead me where the sun is brightest, Where the storm-washed stone is whitest, And there in solitude let me sit As silent and as lorn as it! Yield me now my sad request, Leave meâleave me to my rest. Dark and dread King! Ruler alone! Deep stream that we think not is passing on, And yet it goes forward and is gone,â Where, O Time! is thy hidden source, When wilt thou rest thee from thy course?â A pilgrim art thou on thy path, And thou hast the solitude he hath; Thy step is alone by the dark deep river, And forward thou walkest ever and ever! But art thou of thyselfâAlone From thine own power?âOr has one More awful still the staff supplied, That props thee in thy walk of pride, And bade thy stream for ever flow, And pointed thee the way to go?â Stern and relentless is thy sway!â And withering as the worms of the clay Thy kisses are!âAt thy dark coming The waters of the heart grow chillâ Thy breath her wildest wish benumbing, And bidding her proudest throb be still!â Thou walkest forth into the wild And at thy touch the forest-king Bows his wreathed head!âShe who hath smiled In beauty's blush, the loveliest thing Of allâthy finger passeth over Her cheek, and what remains behind! Thou shroudest in thy mantle's cover The highest hero of his kindâ In his last house thou hid'st him then, And why should we say he lived? Thou changest To wilds the fair abodes of men, And in the wilderness once again A pile of palaces thou rangestâ Where chiefs among their thousands trod, And thousands worshipped at their nod, There hast thou spread the stagnant watersâ There hast thou sent the creeping thing To hiss, and the heron to flap his wingâ And once where Beauty's laughing daughters Had their bright bower, there hast thou made For the lone fox a hiding-shade, A solitude no prayer may blessâ A place of fear and loneliness! The solid earth and roaring ocean, Obey the biddings of thy voice!â Where valleys smiled the river is in motion, And his dimpling waters all rejoice! And where the proud sea often broke, His swelling waves in ceaseless shock, There hast thou bade the green grass shoot, And the tall tree settle and get root!â And more than this thou hast to do!â The rugged rocks and the mountains blue Must crumble and fall!â The stars must fade as words from a page, And the light of the world wander in age!â He must end his proud career on high, And failâand gathered in thy pall, He must shut for ever his radiant eye!â Link after link thy chain creeps fast, Around the world; it will close at lastâ And all things then will be fettered by thee, And lonely and stern will thy triumph be!â THE SAINT. Ossian, then too, our triumphs come Over death, and time, and the tombâ Then shall we win with effort free, Over the victors, victory. OSSIAN. Man of prayers, why return To quench the thought that fain would burn? I am old and most forlorn, And my only rapture is to mourn. I know the grave is dark and deep, Yet I wish I had its pleasant sleep. THE SAINT. Ossian, the grave is only dark, For him whose spirit feels no spark Of Christian sorrow for the sin He long has lived and wantoned in: But he who prays, and hopes and fears, And for his life sheds bitter tears, In other worlds shall win more bliss Than he may think or dream in this. OSSIAN. I know as well as thou, the brave Have endless pleasures past the grave. Good chiefs and warriors dwell for ever On the banks of a pleasant river, Or walk with ever blushing maids, Thro' flowery fields and scented shades, Or hunt the hart o'er dale and hill, Or in their bowers sit calm and still. THE SAINT. The joys of heaven thou hast not told; Nor is it for the brave and bold Its golden gates of love unfold: The good alone, or weak, or strong, May sing in heaven their holy song, And good can only come to thee From christian creed and charity. OSSIAN. And for this, must prayers be read, And beads be told, and matins said? And he that doth not this, and more, Must he never touch that shining shore Of joy thou preachest?âAnd where then Are all those stern and mighty men, Whose steps were on their own green hills In their own strength?âAnd where are they, The sources of the blood that fills, Or once has filled in manhood's day, My swelling veins?âSay, Psalmist, say, Where are Finn and Comhal now? And thou, the darling of my layâ The child of all my love!âWhose brow Was bright and beautiful as day,â Osgurâmy son!âWhereâwhere art thou?â Man of prayers, would'st teach me this? And think'st thou I could share a bliss, Unshared with them?âTo be alone In a strange heaven, unloved, unknown, As I am nowâand have no breast To slumber on and give me restâ This may be joy old man to theeâ But oh! It were dreary and dark for me!â THE SAINT. God hath his mercies. They who went Down to the grave before he sent His word to warn them of the way,â For them he doth not bid me say Exclusion from eternal day. OSSIAN. Man of prayers, I wish not The raptures of thy cloudless lot. Enjoy thy heaven. I know where lies Old Ossian's only paradise!â 'Tis with the beautiful and brave, Beyond the wild and wailing wave Of this cold world.âThe summer there Is cloudless, calm, and ever fair.â I saw it once!âMy 'wakened blood At that one thought rolls back the flood Of age and sorrow, and swells up Like old wine sparkling o'er its cupâ I'll tell thee of the time I spent Beneath that cloudless firmament, And thou shalt judge if aught could be So pure a paradise to me, If by my own frail spirit led Its smile I had not forfeited.â Give me the old Clarseech I hung On my loved treeâso long unstrung, Even to its master's measure free It may refuse its minstrelsy: But give itâand the song, tho' cold, May kindle at a thought of old, Of younger daysâand now and then It may be strong and bright again.â Hear a song of age's daringâ The sighings of the harp of Erin! Waken thou warbler of the west, Waken from thy long, long rest! All day we chased the dark-brown deer Thro' woods and wilds and waters clear: We broke the dew on Allen's breast, And we met the evening on his crest. Like that weak beam I was alone With the whispering breeze and the whitened stone; It was an hour of doubtful light, Half was sunshine, half was night; And the moon, like maiden young and coy, Half struggling with a bashful boy, Was flickering over the calm clear stream, That yet blushed red in the evening beam. I heard upon the echoes borne, A faint and far-off hunting hornâ At the shrill sound my steed, though spent, Pricked up his ears and forward went; Hoping with me once more to gain A party of our hunting train. Forward we went. The horn grew shrill, And shrillerâsee!âfrom yonder hill What floating form of virgin fair, So delicate, it looks like air, Comes sweeping on at utmost speed Low bending to her snowy steed?â The dogs are straining on before herâ Her train is descending the mountain o'er herâ In her wild flight no echo wakes, To tell the bound her courser takesâ The winter's wind when it is highâ The fire flash glancing thro' the sky, Or the torrent in his rudest race, Are not so rapid as that chace!â Aghast I stood!âThe dogs dashed byâ The lady-huntress next swept nighâ A moment in her magic speed, She slightly curbed her milky steed, And looked upon meâO that look Into my heart of hearts I took!â Nay, scoff not psalmistâfor by the light, That now for Ossian no more is bright, I tell thee that one look of her's Would make thy saints idolaters!â When April's evening sky is fair, If its golden folds uncurtained were, All but a misty veil unriven Between thee and thy own bright heavenâ And if thro' it young angel eyes Beamed o'er thee in thy ecstacies, To tell of pardon for thy sin, And give thee peace and smile thee in- It would be like the glance she sent, On me in my astonishment!â And 'twas enough!âI gave the reinâ My steed forgot his toil and pain, And on we swept o'er hill and plain!â On, onâthro' heath, and stream, and woodâ We climbed the bankâwe broke the floodâ But all was mockery to the flight Of the lady on her steed of white!â I see her on the steep hill's browâ I gain itâshe sweeps thro' the valley nowâ Over the valley's breast I strain, But she has ascended the hill again!â Like winding rivers quick and bright, She glanced and faded on my sightâ At last within a brown wood's shade A headlong plunge her courser made, And I far off was left to gaze In mute distraction and amaze. Even then her trainâa fearful crowdâ Came rushing onâlooks strange and proud Flashed for a moment on my faceâ Then turned to track that noiseless chaceâ For as I looked no echoing sound Gave answer to their coursers' boundâ And the rushing of the winds alone, Told that a hunter had passed on. I feared them not, tho' well I knew They were not things of earth!âI drew, And firmly clutched my own good bladeâ One last wild race my courser made, Tho' spent and reelingâon, still on, Thro' tangled shades and wilds unknown He bore me wellânor sigh, nor groan, When down he softly sunk at last, From the proud beast lamenting past. I made him a couch of the branches green, And he had for his shelter the forest screenâ I brought him fresh grass gathered near, And in my helmet water clearâ I smoothed and bathed his drooping crest, And left him to his soothing rest. I sat in the tall tree's trembling shade, And the moss of its trunk my pillow made. My eyes could not their watching keep, My soul was sinking in its sleep, And wild and wavering thoughts came on, Of deeds imagined, actions done, And vain hopes mingling with the true, And real things a man may do. A sigh came o'er me soft and warm! I startedâbut nor shade nor form, Appeared thro' the half-seen gloom around, To utter such a silver sound. It might be the sob of the summer-air, Which glowed so rich and sultry thereâ Again I slumberedâagain the sigh Of woman's fondness fluttered nighâ And while I slistened, gentle lips, Gently met mine,âand touched, and trembled,â As if beneath the moon's eclipse Alone, love's feeling long dissembled, Might dare to own in bashful kisses, Its maiden flame and modest blisses. Fondly I rais'd my arms and prest,â They closed upon my lonely breast. Back from their kiss the young lips startedâ Sighed one rich sighâand touchedâand partedâ I thought of the huntress young and fair, Whose gifted glance had led me there, And I said in the strength of my young heart's sigh, While the tear of passion brimmed mine eyeâ ââLady of kisses!âLip of love!â From the air around, or sky above, Come and bless my desolate arms With the richness of thy charms.â âSon of Earth,â a small voice said, So soft it might be the west wind Murmuring thro' a garden bed, And fraught with feeling, heart and mind, And lip, and language, to declare, Its love for any floweret fairâ âSon of Earth! thy sigh is vain, 'Till thou can'st join our hunting train, Free from earthly touch and stain. And if thou hast wish to hunt with me, Three days shalt thou silent beâ Three days and nights thou shalt not sleepâ Nor sigh, nor smileânor laugh, nor weepâ Nor warm thy wish with earthly foodâ Nor slake thy thirst with earthly flood. When thou dost this for love of me, Again sleep under the wild-wood tree And pleasant shall thy waking be.ââ âChild of the breeze!âwhereâwho art thou? Let me see thy lovely brow!â âViewless I am, and must be, till Thy three days task thou dost fulfil. I am of the people of the hillâ A SidhÃ©Ã© spirit pure and free, From all the cares that 'cumber thee. I live in a land where the blushing light Is always constant, calm, and bright; Grief is not there, nor age, nor death, But evergreen youth, and endless breath, And life that tires not with the living, And love that loathes not with the giving. Stern sons of men who struggling die, In Virtue's cause, or Freedom's high, Come there across the waste of water, Guided by a SidhÃ©Ã©'s daughter; And live at leisure calm and free, To follow what their wish may be. Son of Finn! could'st thou forsake The hills that now thy pleasure make; Defying death, and the care and pain That here for thy old white hairs remain, And come to live with love and me, In such a land of liberty?â âVoice of softness! Cans't thou love me? Thou art a beam too far above me. I'd fly with thee thro' the waste of water, The raging flame or the field of slaughter, Thro' deserts where man no footing findsâ Thro' all the waves and all the winds!â Dost thou love me child of light?â Is Ossian pleasant in thy sight?â âThe sigh that broke thy gentle sleep, Might teach thy tongue its word to keep. Return, fair Ossian, to thy hill, I will be here to love thee still.â END OF THE FIRST DUAN. THE SECOND DUAN. I went and came. The wild-wood tree, Again spread out my canopy. I could not sleep. I sat in grief And listened to the rustling leaf. She came not o'er me as beforeâ No murmuring breeze her whispers boreâ No timid touch of her soft lip From mine its kisses now would sip. A far-off sigh alone I heard Like the night-wind thro' the thistle's beard.â âWhy wilt thou shun me, child of bliss?â I come to claim thy promis'd kiss.â âThou com'st to claim, but hast not done Thy promise like a faithful one. This morn thy sister, who hath wept Because thy soft sleep was unslept, In Allen's stately hall held up, With sighs and smiles the parting cup, And thou didst taste the blushing wine And therefore art no love of mine. Come, back again and with thee bring, A lip unstain'd by earthly thing.â Sad I returned. That night I slept, And eat and drank and wildly weptâ But thence three days and nights I waked, My feast untouchedâmy thirst unslaked, And again beneath the wild-tree's shade, I called in sighs my ariel maid. And farther off her voice repliedâ âTho' thou hast neither smiled nor sighed, Nor furled in sleep thy sorrow's wing, Nor eat nor drank of earthly thing, Yet, as this morning at the gate Thy sister stood all desolate, And prayed of thee a parting kissâ Thouâall unmindful of the bliss That warms a purer cheek and breast, Didst yield the girl her fond request. Come, back again and with thee bring, A lip unstained by earthly thing.ââ I did return and with me brought The unstained lip the spirit sought. I sat in sleep beneath that tree, Sweet sleep that came on suddenlyâ Her warm wild sigh stole o'er me then, And woo'd me to my thought againâ I felt a cheek of tenderest touch Laid gently to the burning blush, That mantled mineâI felt young arms Steal round and round meâand all the charms Of a fond,âfluttering, loving breast, To mine in murmuring raptures prest. âFrom this fond and free caress, Wake Son of Earth thy sleep to blessâ Wake to the joy of breathing free, The breath of immortality!â It was too muchâtoo keen a pleasure For a mere mortal heart to measure!â My sinews thrilledâmy breathing wentâ My labouring pulse its throbbings spent, And my soul faded into night, Darkening in its own delight. I woke as men from doubtful dreams, In the broad sun's real beams, Oft waken to look back with fright Upon their phantoms of the night. The life I ledâthe days gone by, I thought of, dark and doubtinglyâ It was not an action or a scene, In which I felt I might have been, Rather some unsubstantial play, Of fancy in her holiday. A brighter thought came to my tongueâ A livelier life within me sprungâ A fresher current of young blood, Sent to my heart its thrilling flood, And my lightened limbs disdained to rest, On the cold earth's cloddy breast. I woke upon a wild sea shore, The waste was round the sky was o'erâ My head was cradled on her kneeâ And there she watched me silently, Like the sun shining on a flower, That all alone lives thro' its hour, In some forsaken wilderness. I woke and woo'd her heart's caress, And she did give it wild and free As her kiss beneath the forest tree. And I felt with her and she with meâ My thoughts were hers, and mutually I had her thinkingsâheart in heart And mind in mind together blended, Like streams that cannot live apart, But in one glassy lake have ended. And shining and soft was her virgin form, In full-blown beauty wild and warm! I know not if aught of earthly blood, Mingled with the magic flood That fed her veinsâbut you might see A rich vein wandering sportively, Beneath the bright transparent skin, That kept its sparkling essence in. 'Twas an earthly shape but polish'd too high For an earthly touch or an earthly eyeâ 'Twas an earthly shape!âWhat else could be Moulded or made to rapture me? What other form could loveliness take To bid my doating eye-balls ache, And boil my blood and fire my brain In agonies of blissful pain?â Nay, Saint, I pass thy word of scornâ Thyself hath sung this very morn, Of beautiful and blushing things, With golden hair and snowy wings, Fair beyond minstrel's fancyings, Who, moulded like to forms of earth Even in thy own heaven have birth, Tho' basking in such holy light, Hath made them look more soft and whiteâ I tell thee there she sat with me, Fairer than earthly woman may beâ And she floated before my fainting glance, Like the shapes of air that softly dance Round the glorious evening sun, In joy that his daily task is done. Her eye was large and soft and dark, Floating in fondnessâoften a spark, Of mild and chastened light shone thro', And it was even as a drop of dew Half seen within a darkened bower, In the morning misty hour, And you might know that underneath All of her that did look or breathe, There was a spirit pure and chaste, As ice upon the unsunned waste, Or silver waters underground, That the searching day has never found.â âAnd she looked on me, and I on her, Each glance the other's worshipperâ A long, long lookâan endless stream Of ever-gushing loveâa beam, Unbroken as the lonely one For ever flowing from the sun. And I know not howâfor years come on, And mind and memory half are gone: And things that in our morning youth, Seemed strong and durable as truth, In age's twilight fade away To shapeless shades and will not stayâ I know not howâbut we have broke The chains of that dear dream, and woke, And left that solitary shore, To laugh amid the billow's roar! Yes!âswift as the wild wind that gives it its motion, We travelled the waste of the desolate oceanâ And how proudly I rode on the back of the billow, With her lip for my kiss and her breast for my pillow! We came to a land where the light of the world, Hath brightest his standard of summer unfurled,â We touch itâwe pass itâwe traverse its scope Like the glancing of thought or the gleamings of hope! I have no memory of the things, I saw or met in that fearful flightâ They only make strange visitings, To my sleeping thoughts in a dream of nightâ Yet half I remember as we past A desert of sand outstripping its blast, Of savage shapes and forms of fear That came to look on us too nearâ And the hungry glaring of their cyes Half yielded to a stern surprise, To see such rapid travellers there, Or hear us hurrying thro' the air. And on!âThe blue hills backward fly Trees, rocks, and the world and all glance by!â And once as I gave a farewell look To the old sun I had forsook, He seemed as if rushing down the sky, To drink the depths of the ocean dry, And finish his long and lonely reign, And never light up the world again. On, on! And we came to the last cold shore That aged sun is shining o'er.â It was a scene of feature wildâ Its rocks in random ruin piledâ And towers of ice and hills of snow, Mocking the wither'd waste below. Yet there all beautiful and bright The sun was shedding his chastened lightâ It seemed as if faithless trees and flowers, That vary with the varying hours, And eyes and cheeks that change at will, And worldly hearts more fickle still, Had tired him with their dull deceit, And he no more would lend them heat, Or light or lifeâbut hither came, To shine on things that, cold and tame, And shapeless, and strange as they might be, Smiled always in white constancy. And there away from house and tower He spent his silent noon-tide hour, All sportively: his soft beam fell On many a glancing icicle, And kindled up each crystal height, With rainbow hue and chequered light. And I thought he wished no other eye To gladden at a scene so high, But all in solitude smiled to see The play of his own pleasantry. On, on!âThat spangling scene is past, And we have left the world at last! I cannot tell you if we went, Upward or downâthro' firmament, Or wind or waterâair or lightâ It was even as a vision of night, When youthful hearts that pant for heaven, Dream of some rich and rosy even, Upon whose perfumed breeze they rise, Like the mist of the hill in summer skies.â I saw not, touch'd not aught but her, Who was my bosom's comforter, In that rash flightâenough for me, To feel her clasp me tenderly, And with her kisses call from death The flutterings of my failing breathâ O then! in what a keen delight, We shot upon our airy flightâ Like the lone comet calm and fair, Cleaving the silent realms of the air!â I said I knew not aught was thereâ Nor saw a shape, nor heard a sound In all the voiceless space aroundâ Yet have I thoughtâa half-dreamt thought, That far and doubtingly I caught, While in our rush of silence hurled A parting glance of my native worldâ The stars were upâand weak and small, They twinkled round a darkened ballâ I strove to fix them on my sightâ And as I looked their points of light Lengthened to lines, that quick and slight Traversed each other, and entwined Like a maiden's tresses in the windâ And still I look and still they glance, And mingle in their misty danceâ And faint and fainter, and now they flyâ And now they fail, and now they dieâ And they and the spot they woke to light Have melted from my swimming sight!â One earthly sigh I gave to part, From the world that warmed my youthful heart.â And on, and on!âBut how or where? I felt no motion in the air, And I think no breeze was busy thereâ But I was swathed as in a mist, That the morning sun-beam has not kiss'dâ And I was hurled as in a wind, That all but leaves a thought behindâ On, on!âand have we not touch'd at last, Some gentle substance as we passed?â I thought our flight less fearful now, And I looked upon my Spirit's brow To read its smileâO well I knew My own heart's thought reflected true!â And smoother still we glide alongâ Smooth as the gushing flow of songâ The velvet sod we press at lastâ The gathered mist aside is castâ And arm in arm, and hand in hand, We wander thro' her own bright land! END OF THE SECOND DUAN. THIRD DUAN. THE SAINT. Ossian, enough of this dotard theme, Lit up at the meteor-blaze of a dream, Wanton and vain as ever was fann'd By the deadly zeal of the evil one's hand. OSSIAN. Man of prayers, and dost thou dare To say to Ossian he was not there?â THE SAINT. I tell thee, Ossian, it was a vain And wicked vision of thy brain, Coming in sleep from thoughts of sin, That wantoned thy waking soul within, And dark and aged as thou art, And withered as is thy wayward heart, Fitter were it, old man, for thee To pray on bare and bended knee, And tell thy blessed rosary, Than here upon this blasted hill, To sing thy song of weakness still. Arise and walk!âThe sloping sun Hath half his daily business done, And we are warned of penance unsped, And psalms unsung, and prayers unread. OSSIAN. Away, and leave me to my wrath, No other vengeance Ossian hath, For all the slanders of thy tongue, And the tears of shame thy words have rung From his old heartâawayâaway!â And were it but an earlier day That word, false Saint, thou durst not say!â Oh, Osgur! my heart's darling son, Thy father's deeds are all undone!â He is in darkness, and must hear The word of shame come on his ear, And he may not raise a sword or spear! The last of all the Fenian race Sits on his own hill in disgrace!â But were he hereâor were there one Of all my heros that are goneâ Thou lying slanderer of the brave, The sod thou standest on were thy grave! And did'st thouâdarest thou talk to me Of speakingâthinking falsity? And speak I of Osgur?âman of prayersâ I care not for these old white hairsâ Roll off the cloud that closes o'er meâ Let me but see thee stand before meâ Break this staff, and in my hand Let me feel my father's brandâ Then might'st thou wish thy prayers read, Thy shriving o'er and thy penance sped!â THE SAINT. A wayward penitent to me, I fear me, Ossian, thou wilt be. I said not, I wished not to say A word to steal thy fame away; I must believe that for thy race There is but one pure dwelling placeâ I must believe that soul or spirit No sense of mortal touch inheritâ And this I must if I have faith In him who died to conquer death, And hope with him in light to be, A measureless eternity. Thou hast thy creed, and I have mine, And if I will not bow to thine, How do I err to them or thee, But as thyself hath erred to me? Ossian, the Fenii's fame is high, Their deeds are sung and can never dieâ Strong were they on their hills of power, And happy was their peaceful hourâ They have failed on earth as the sun goes down Over Slieve Gullian's craggy crown, When he leaves the world he smiled upon, Warm with the light of his glories gone. OSSIAN. Free be thy faithâand I rejoice To hear in peace thy harmless voice. Well hast thou spoken. Man of age! Our whole race was one spreading page Of truth and whiteness, free from stains As the bounding blood within their veins. Nay rest we hereâ'tis very long Since Ossian gave his soul to song; I know the sun hath soared his fling Now pointing to earth his golden wingâ Yet if thou wilt but list my lay, A double penance will I say For this upon my shriving day. A dream it was not. Well I know How short a way our visions go, To give us half the living bliss, I quaffed upon her virgin kiss! And now we are in her land of love, With a light below and a sky above, And such a breathing life around, And such a mingling of soft sound, I have no words to tell the thought, With which my fainting soul is fraught!â And if I had what pulse could beat, What bright'ning brow could flush with heat, And give the smile to the bard so dear, And only age and coldness here?â Ask me if the flowers were fairâ Ask me if the sighing air Was soft and pleasantâI will say Thou think'st but of an earthly day, And earthly flowers, and air, and skies, And mak'st with them my Paradise!â But seek not on cold and earthly things To fetter thy imaginings, If thou would'st wish one glimpse to win Of that pure heaven I have been inâ Lie on the green hill's sunny side, And listen to the dashing tideâ Let the flowers be blushing nigh thee, And lay thy harp in slumbers by thee, Save that now and then thy finger On some small chord will love to linger, Which, chance and fancy half inspiring, Thy softened soul is gently firingâ Then while the evening-beam blushes red, And the high grass is waving o'er thy head, And thine eyes are half closed in the rosy light, And thy thoughts within are sparkling bright, Then may'st thou image some floating scene, Like that lovely land where I have been! Yet it wanted not its own wild hill, The spreading tree and the silver rillâ The silent lakeâthe stretching shore, And the hoarseness of the torrent's roarâ Scenes which the true bard loves to see, Whether on earth or in heaven he be. And ever its gentle rivers glided Thro' fields of flowers, which they divided, As the minstrel-measure parts in song The flowers his fancy strays among.â And its small flowers were always fair, And soft to the touch as summer airâ Their only business was to live, And to the breeze their perfumes give, And in return the breezes crept Into their bosoms while they slept, And left them all the sweets they found In their flight the world around. I know not whence the day-beam came, But it was ever and ever the sameâ A living light that streamed for ever On hill and mountain, lake and river: Without a burst, without a shade, One mild and virgin day it madeâ In which no sultry breeze could blast, Nor cloud, nor tempest overcast, Nor sullen mist its damp distil, Nor wild wind rave, nor winter chill. I say not that the young eyes there Made that modest light less fair. It might be that one roving ray First called a love-look into day, And from two starry eyes drew forth, A freshened glow and added worthâ And these eyes looked on other eyes, And kindled up new brilliancesâ And other eyes still woke each other, And every soft beam had a brother, 'Till mingling quick and flashing wide, The gathered radiance gave its tideâ And blushing cheeks, and blushing flowers Richly mellowed its dazzling powers, And lake and river, air and sky, For ever made it multiply. I think such might be the mingled ray That there gave out its pleasant day, For it seemed to glitter a little less, When my loved one slept in gentleness; And the only faint fading of that light, Which gave but the calmness of earthly night, Was when a thousand eyes were sleeping Unearthly sleep, that had been keeping The day so fresh and fair about them, It could not be day or light without them. There was a voice throughout the air That spoke of soul and spirit thereâ And ever as you breathed its sigh, I may not name the thinkings high That o'er your mind in freshness stole, And wildly woke the startled soul. And it made minstrelsyâand spoke Language, that bards all vainly invoke, When they would tell of words half broken, With the river-spirit spoken, Or catch from the careering breeze, Its darkly-whispered mysteries. And all was musicâair and sky And waterâand the harmony Of what was spokenâand the song Of shining birds, that in a throng Their distant warblings would prolong. Then it was most pleasant to see The innocent creatures there that be, Sitting or walking joyously In their bower or thro' their shade, Bard and warrior, youth and maid, Each happy as he wished to be In all the range of liberty. Young eyes were ever glancing round, Eyes that never wept or frownedâ And the laugh of those happy hearts was like Strains that enraptured minstrels strike, In one full and bursting measure, When they give their souls to sound and pleasure. All were happyâbut some felt A holier joy, and others dwelt In higher glory. I saw one Who for the good deeds he had done, On earth was here a worshipped king Triumphant o'er all suffering.â On the utmost edge of his own shore. One foot amid the breaker's roar, Another on the rocky strand He met the invading foeâhis hand Grasped its good sword;âhe was alone, And they were thousandsâand when flown His strength at last, he could but throw Between his country and the foe His heartâand thro' it bid them smite At her's.â He fellâbut in the light Of Paradise the hero's deed Found fittest eulogy and meed; The gaping death-gash on his side Was turned to gloryâfar and wide As a bright star it beamedâand he Walked on in immortality Worshipped and wondered atâthe brave Unenvious to his virtue gave, Honour and fame, and praise,âthe old Blessed him as he passed by, and told His name in reverenceâbeauty's tongue Her laugh of love and her soft song, Ever at his approach were hushed Unconsciously,âand thousands rushed Forgetful of themselves to gaze, And give in looking their heart's praise To him, of heroes the highest and best, Whose death-wound was turned to a star on his breast! With him walked one in converse high, Of lesser shapeâbut whose quick eye Sent inspiration roundâthe rush Of bright thoughts in a dazzling blush Spread o'er his face.âMusic and song At his birth informed his tongue And fired his soulâand with them came The throb for freedom; but the name Of his own land had passed away, And fettered amid her waves she lay Like a strong man on his hillâthe bard In all her breezes only heard The sigh of her past fameâno strain Rose o'er her desolated plain To mourn her glories gone, or call The blush of shame for her early fall Up to her cold destroyer's cheek, Or on his heart in thunders break. But the bard caught up his harp and woke His Country's Song!âAnd as it broke Forth in its pride, unmoved he met From despot tongues their chide or threatâ The lordly frown or luring smile That strove to silence, or beguile To silence, a song so high and bold, So true and fearlessâfor it told Her tale in every strain!âThe wrong And outrage she had suffered long Went forth among the nationsâ'till The eyes of men began to fill With sorrow for her sorrowsâand Even in that cold and careless land That wrought her woe, one manly sigh Was heard at last in sympathy With all her suffering; and for this Thro' our world of light and bliss He walked immortal, side by side, With him the hero who had died The highest death a hero can die, For his native land and her liberty! And equal reverence to the bard All creatures gaveâand his reward Was equal gloryâa blessed song Went with them as they walked alongâ It was over and round them on their way, And ever it said thro' the cloudless dayâ âJoy to the hero, who dared, and died For his country's honor, and fame, and pride; And joy to the bard whose song brought fame And pride to his fallen country's name!â And I saw such scenes of joy and love In Paradise, that I could rove Its holy bowers for ever and be For ever blessed such joy to see.â I saw an old man sitting aloneâ On earth he left a darling one, And for her coming waited here, Without her Paradise was not dear! In pain and sickness, want and woe She had soothed or shared his bosom's throe; He had no pillow but her breast, No song but her's to sing him to rest, No tear but her's to meet his grief, No smile but her's to beam relief, No hand but her's to bring him food,â She was his only earthly good!â Her youth and loveliness she forgot, To shield his years, and share his lotâ The red rose withered on her cheek Uncared forâshe could only seek Her father's heart by every wile And every care; and if a smile Dawned o'er his languid brow, to her 'Twas a more blessed comforter Than morning's mildest promise, when It smiles on hopeless sea-wrecked men. Oft as she watched his fitful sleep, And wished, and longed, but feared to weep The old man in his dreams would press Her handâshe would feel his caress, And his fond and murmured blessing hear, With bounding heart and raptured ear, And every nerve upon the spring To pay his love with answering cling,â But fear to break his sleep would check Her natural instinctâround his neck Her innocent arms she then would steal That he their pressure might not feel, And to his wan and wasted brow Her lovely head in reverence bow, And breathe upon it her meek kiss Of duteous love and holy bliss. Alas! in earlier, happier hours, Hope had entwined some blushing flowers For her young heart; yes, there was one She loved and could have doted on Thro' weal and woeâfain would he take Her heart to his to still its ache, And she that true heart would have given If sorrow for herself had riven Its tender core; but now she said She would watch by her father's bed In his old age, and have no thought But for his good:âand well she wrought Her blessed task, until at last The old man's struggling spirit passed, And her young cheek was worn and wan As his from which the life had gone! She sought him soon. Even as I spoke With him beneath his spreading oak, In solitude, that holy maid Came on to meet him. She was arrayed In whitest glory; and, as a beam Of moonlight, or a morning dream, Dreamt by a saint, she cameâhe saw And knew her coming,âlove and awe, Rapture and thankfulness were in his lookâ And up he rose,âand first he took Her innocent hand, and fixed his eye Ecstatic on her, and then nigh And nigher to his old heart he drew Its only darling!âAnd they grew Together in a long caress Of wordless love and happiness. I met some blissful children playing Thro' the fair fieldsâand they were straying, Wherever their innocent fancy sent A wish before them. But I bent My eye on one, a glorious boy, Who in this life had been the joy Of a widowed motherâno second child She hadâand when he laughed or smiled, Her eyes in happy tears would swim, And her very heart laugh out with him. They walked togetherâit was o'er A craggy, steep, and sea-washed shore: The boy ran on to snatch a flower From the rock's edgeâAlas! no power The wretched mother had to say, Or shriek her fearâAwayâaway, Downâdown he fell! âA night and day, Insensible of life she lay, And then her shuddering soul had rest, And here she came among the blest, To meet her loved one. As she came Instinctively she named his name, In tenderest accentsâthe boy turned And knew his mother!âHis cheek burned With rosier brightnessâfrom among His wondering playmates up he sprung, And round her neck like ivy clung! And she in the embrace she gave, Seemed as for ever she would save Her child from harm, and make him one With her own essence. âMy son, my son,â She said, âlive here upon my heart, Now we shall neverânever part.â A father walked in silent ways With his two children. Full ripe days Of manhood he had known, and they, A boy and girl, died in the May Of earthly life, and took their way To him in Paradise. As they walked, The father to his children talked Of their good mother, who on earth Still lived and of a coming birth Which would give them in after years Another playmate. In her tears On earth the widow dwelt. She knew, And anguish on that knowledge grew, That when her husband died, he left An unborn orphan with her.â'Reft In him of all that could give life To life itself, now it was strife To breathe or walk the earthâthe child She carried if it ever smiled In this cold world would be forlorn As ever was infant orphan-born; For she was hopeless, helpless, low, And she only wished to die, and go Where he had gone, whose early heart Was hers; whose life in every part, Since their first union, had been spent In chastened love and meek content, For her and with her. Her hour came on, And she was made mother of a son. Into her feeble arms she took Her feebler infantâone fond look, One mother's kiss she gave, then shook Convulsively and diedâand death Came on her babe in the same breath. I saw the happy, happy greeting, Of this fond family at their meeting. With his children hand in hand, By a lone lake's spreading strand, The father walked;âto its far shore, The fair girl looked and pointedâmore She could not say, but turned and ran To meet her motherâthen began A scene of Paradise! The boy Followed his sister in such joy As youth, and natural love, refined And made immortal, to his mind Might bring, impulsive. With freshened brow, The mother moved majestic now, And her young infant to her breast So fondly, yet so gently prest, Her arms crossed o'er it like a braid Of white flowers on a lambkin;âled By equal love she rushed to meet Her happy childrenâand quick feet Soon find each otherâthe boy clung First to his mother's breast, and hung As a garland thereâthe girl had ta'en To kiss it o'er and o'er again The infant to herself; and when Her brother gave his welcome, then He took her lovely load, that she Might also at full liberty, Go to her mother's arms. Meanwhile The father with a fond, fond smile, Shining o'er all his face came on At gentle speedâhis glance hath gone Before him with its welcomeâher's Hath met itâO the thrill that stirs In two such hearts, when two such eyes, Meet once again in Paradise! She shrieked her joyâand to the child Yet clinging to her gave a wild And hasty kiss, and being free From that embrace, all eagerly Out of the young boy's arms she took, Her rosy infant, and with a look, I felt and feel but may not speak, Ran forward and held forth its cheek To tempt its father's kissâand then, She gave it to the boy again, And the fond wife and husband prest, Each other to each other's breast, In such chaste rapture as is known In bowers of blessedness alone!â On his hill old Comhal dweltâ I saw him, and in awe I knelt: He raised me with his aged hand, And asked of his own lovely land, And spoke of Finn; and when I told The fields of fight of that hero bold, He wept in joy for the fame he won, And often blessed his only son. And there he dwelt upon his hill, And thought of his deeds of danger still, Or mounted on his cloudy steed, Hunted the stag in pleasant speed. Sometimes my gentle love and I Such wild unearthly sport would try, And it was ecstacy to chase, That brown stag in his mimic race! My horse was of the darkened air, My dogs were made of the breezes there, And the bounding stag was born of light Made visible like the rainbow bright!â And together we sat in her house of flowers, And laughed at the careering hoursâ Silence was round us except the sigh Of the love-sick breezes floating by, Or the small sweet song of the beautiful birds That like us lived on loving:âwords We wanted notâour hearts and eyes Shone through each otherâthoughts and sighs Were mutualâand for our nuptial bed The tenderest flowers their softness shed And burned in blushes ripe and red, Such lovely limbs as her's to press In all their modest nakedness. Our's was not earthly love. To sit A little parted and opposite, And gently hold each other's hand, While the vassal-breeze our sighings fanned Backward and forwardâand to look Long in each other's eyes, that took Our thinkings to the heart, and then Gave them out in light again; Thus to be without motion or stir, Each the other's idolater, Alone, and long, and wordless; 'till Our eyes began with tears to fill, Our frames with faintness, and our sighs, With choaked and broken ecstacies, And we at last sunk gentlyâfolded In holy fondness;âthus to be, And thus to feel!âNo creature moulded In feelings of mere mortality, May ever think or ever bring Such bliss to his imagining.â Or we wandered among shining streams, That like the bard's delicious dreams, Ever flow thro' beds of flowers, And golden vales, and blushing bowers. And all in playfulness we gaze, With sportive and well feign'd amaze On the waterâand start and blush, To see ourselves there, and we rush And plunge together, as if to save Each other from that innocent wave, Then with it go and glide along, In echoing laughter, mirth, and song. Or alone we sat by the foamy fountain, In the solitude of the silent mountain, And I plucked a water-flower from its flow, And wreathed it with leaves on the mountain that grow. And when on her head it was a crown, At her feet I knelt me down, And called her the lady and the queen, Of that wild and desolate scene. Or oftenâfor our pure nature gave That triumph over the gloomy graveâ Often our spirits winged away, Disembodied through the day, And into aught they would possess, Breathed themselves in gentleness; And so became the breeze or dew, Or shrub, or flower of any hue. Then sometimes my love was the tall young tree, That grows on the mountain lonelily, And I was the wooing eglantine, Around her slender shape to twine, And climb till I kissed the topmost bough, That blossom'd on her fragrant brow. Or she was the softly opening flower, Among a thousand in her bower, And I was the bee that passed all by, 'Till I saw my own flower blushing nigh, And then, in her bleeding bosom I lay, And sipt its sweets and flew away. Or still she was that rose, and I Came down as a soft wind from the sky, And sadly I sighed thro' fields and bowers, 'Till I found at last my flower of flowers, And then beneath her folds I crept, And there in perfumed sweetness slept. Or a crystal drop was on her leaf, And I playfully called it the tear of grief, And then I was the loving light, To kiss away its essence bright! Or she kept her own immortal form, And I came as the breezes wild and warm Of which she breathed. I was a sigh Within her heart, alternately Coming and going. Or as she lay Reclining, I stole in amorous play, And fluttered all over her gentle frame, As if to fan its virgin flame! END OF THE THIRD DUAN. THE FOURTH DUAN. And yet beneath that happy sky, Was heard one ever-during sigh, One heart of sadness there was known, One voice of sorrow wept alone, And o'er that Paradise it would break, Like a single tear on a sunny cheek. And it named a name in all its weeping, The sighing heart was sick with keeping. It named a name whose very sound, On such a lip, in such holy ground, Proved all enough that name to sever From it and Paradise for ever. Minona! The sad voice was thine, And the oft-whisper'd name was mine. Silent I sat in my Spirit's bower; It was her gentle slumbering hour; Her head was cradled on my breast, And she had sighed herself to rest: And all around, the clustering trees, Had closed on love's lone mysteries, Making a modest twilight, such As love itself deemed not too much. I heard amongst the bushes round, A sobbing sighâa moaning soundâ And then I saw blue weeping eyes, Gaze on me in my mute surpriseâ And they streamed thro' the dark bower's leafy shroud Like azure thro' a thunder cloud. A feeble recollection came, Of looks like these and eyes the sameâ And more intense my gazings grew, But the young eyes faded from my view, And I only heard a whispering song, Its mournful music thus prolong. My life on earth was a long, long sigh, Of hopes and fears, of hopes and fears; My life on earth was a long, long shower, Of silent tears, of silent tears: And the sudden smile that sometimes came, O'er all my woe, o'er all my woe, Was the tempest-flash that breaks upon The void below, the void below. I could not live on earth to love, And love in vain, and love in vain, And I died to seek some other land, To soothe my pain, to soothe my pain. The flowers were bright, the sky was fair, Morn and even, morn and even, But Ossian was on earth behind, And it was not heaven, it was not heaven. I often wept and wished him dead, And here with me, and here with me, He might forget his greatness then, And kinder be, and kinder be. He came at last, but not alone, My wish to bless, my wish to bless, Another heart has made for him His happiness, his happiness. I wish I was on earth again, In rougher skies, in rougher skies, Their tears and darkness would be like My agonies, my agonies. Oh! it is comfortless to live In lonely sighs, in lonely sighs, The only weeping thing that walks Thro' Paradise, thro' Paradise. The sighing song has ceased around, So gentle in its whispering sound, On her soft ear who yet is sleeping, It came unheard; but sobs and weeping Yet linger round me, and I listened 'Till the trembling tear of pity glistenedâ âWho art thou, mourner all alone? And how was Ossian loved or known?â âWhen happier eyes have holy rest, And every heart but mine is blest, O meet me in my silent vale, And listen to my weeping tale. Ossian, I hope not for thy kiss,â But, give thy tearâit would be bliss I never had, to see thee weep, And hear thee wish my woes asleep.â I met her in her silent vale. And listened to her weeping tale. I listenedâwe were there aloneâ In sorrow; and I looked upon A face and form whose fresh, fair youth, So full of tenderness and truth, Was wet with tears for love of me, And if I smiled, not doom to be For ever fading. And she spoke In sighings wild, that, fluttering, broke From the heart's prison, where they had slept A long, sad slumberâand she wept Warm, streaming tears, and knew not whether In love or grief, or both together, Their gushings wandered.âNeeds there more To tell a tale oft told before? I braved the sea, and was tempest tossed, I looked, and listened, and was lost! Beauty!âThe bard's eternal theme, His long, long sigh, his ceaseless dream, His hope, his virtue, and his sin, The breath that brings him life within!â To bask an hour bright beam in thee, How have I darkened my destiny, When it was shining clear and calm, And dared to be the thing I am! With thee my life wove all its flowers, For thee my eyes shed all their showers, For thee I left my field of fame, And risked a dear and deathless nameâ For thee I gave up my world to brave The rushing wind and roaring wave, In my Paradise I forgot, Its flowers for thee, and loved them not; For thee my sin was unforgiven, And I left my earth, and lost my heaven! What was her story?âhear it flow In her own wild words of woe. âOssian, thou wert my soul's first sigh, My virgin heart's idolatry! I saw thee in thy father's hall, The fairest there, the first of all: The softest voice of sounding song, The bravest in the battle throng, The rosiest cheek, the richest smile, That lighted up our own green isle. I saw thee, but alone I stood In my young heart's widowhood; I was too lowly ever to be A beam of loveliness to thee; Yet like the flower I looked upon My own loved light where'er it shone, 'Till it had scorched my leaves at last, And left them withering in the blast! âIt was my springâmy budding hourâ And in thy smile my heart was born, And for thy sake it got the power Of loving in that maiden morn; But when it loved too long and lone, And had no hope of love from thee, Still like the flower when the light is gone, It shut its leaves and would not be. No colder smileâno moonshine glow, Might ever waken it from its woe!â âI was the most forsaken one That walk'd and wept beneath the sun!â The virgin streamâthe first fond gush My young heart gave, it could not rush Forth and rejoice, but backward crept, And in the poor heart's silence slept, Sickening in its own repose, Like dull deep water that never flows. My youth was joylessâand my fate, I thought it dark and desolate, As if thy own harp all forsaken Lay silent and untouch'd by thee, For no other hand could waken Its neglected harmony!â âOne wish I had. It was to take My death from him I loved so wellâ My heart was breaking and would break, Ere words or sighs its tale might tell; But rather than live 'till it grew dark In its own helplessness, I sought His shining sword, to strike one spark Of feeling thro' it: I recked not If pain or pleasureâand in the flame Which from that spark all quickly came, I thought it would be bliss to burn, And into dull cold ashes turn! âI thought from him who bade me cease To love, such recompense were dueâ I thought that he who killed my peace, Should kill my mind and memory too!â âI had my wish!âThe battle cameâ The blazing sun flung forth its flameâ The Fenii went to quell the pride Of Morni's hostâthat evening tide I grasped a spearâthy foeman's crest My flushed and throbbing forehead prest, And I felt no fear!âA warrior boy, So young, thou scarcely coulds't destroy, Came out to brave thee from the crowd, Like a faint flash from a tempest-cloud,â Thy sword descended on my breast, And I thought I had my pleasant rest. âBut here on this bright shore I woke, To weep for thee and love thee stillâ Thy sword my young life's vision broke, My memory it could not kill!â I sate alone by the bubbling stream, And sang a song of fondness to itâ But it gushed onâand in my dream Often I would wildly woo itâ And ever as it stole away, I wept and sighedââfalse Ossian stay!â It took my tearâit heard me sigh, And smiled in scorn and passed me by. âGo, Ossianâgoâthy sleeping flower Hath wakened in her happy bowerâ My tale is toldâbut art thou here Breathing the same soft air with me, And must I weep my widowed tear And neverânever blissful be? âGo, OssianâgoâI wish for thee A life of love eternally, Tho' thou hast been to me the blast That chilled my dream of one world's bliss, And from that triumph now hath past To wither up my hopes in thisâ Oh! kill me, Ossian, once again, And my sleep may be eternal then!â Her soft voice sunk in broken sighs, Half rapture and half agonies; Her moist blue eyes were shut in tears, And they bathed her lips and the red and white Of her rich cheekâand thus appears, Ere the sun comes to lend them light, A cluster of three fairest flowers, Lily, violet and rose, Sorrowing in the dewy showers, The night has wept on their reposeâ And one white arm she tossed on high, And it fell against a green bank nigh, Resting there unconsciouslyâ And over it her head was drooping So hopelessly!âAnd she was stooping, Half turned from my enraptured look, That now in all its glancings took Abundant love.âOh! who could pause For the cold pitiful applause Of prudence then!âNay had I stood On the bare edge of a rockâ And saw her thus beneath a flood The wildest of the wildâits shock I could despise and brave, and mockâ Plungingâtho' to my early grave, To clasp and kiss her under its wave!â And forward I have bent and sighed A sigh that her's have multipliedâ And now my wooing arms are stealing Round herâand now I am unveiling Her young cheek from the wild bright hair That strove to hide its blushings fair,â Like a golden sun-burst streaming proud O'er summer evening's crimson-cloudâ And gentle strife I have to turn Her lips to mine that madly burnâ And half an effort she would make, My fond embraces not to take; At last she paused and in my eyes Looked up in questioning surprise, And chilling doubts, and hopes and fears, And wishings wild, and smiles and tears,â On her cheek and in her eye Mingled and fought for masteryâ And love can read the look it loves, So true, the reading never proves Doubtful or falseâand when she dwelt Long, long, on mine, and knew and felt My heart was her'sâthat happy maid, One step drew back, while laughter played Convulsive on her lipâthen flung Herself around me, warm and youngâ And blushing bright and wildly weeping, Crept close into my bosom's keeping. âBy the smooth lake's silver wave A bower of loveliness I haveâ Over the mountain, away and far, Where nothing but flowers and breezes areâ I wove it in that pathless wild, To weep alone, when others smiledâ And its friendly shade my secret kept, And no laugh was round me when I weptâ And not a leaf its wildness wears, But has been nurtured in my tears!â âOh!âwe will go together there, And give the drooping flowers one smileâ And they will look more fresh and fair, Than any in this blessed isle!â No sound or voice will ever come On our silence to intrudeâ And thou shalt have my flowery home, And faithful heart in solitude!ââ âThe kiss was given!âand a wind Came rushing o'er the rocks behind, Too rude to be the breeze that fanned The roses of that happy landâ And as it hurried by, the air Darkened, and made a shadow there, Which feebly and confusedly took My spirit's formâher cloudy look Glanced anger on meâand she past Careering on the wrathful blastâ Then I was in a place, all light And silenceâshapes more chastely white Than I had seen stood in a throng, Entrancedâas listening to some song Of holy power, which they alone Might hear and worshipâand there was one, Throned in the midst, a radiant form Of unveiled gloryâbut not warm And scorching like the sun'sâhis light, Tho' it dazzled more, was silvery bright And awfulâand he was the king Of Paradiseâand every thing That lives or breathes. A creature knelt Weeping beneath his smile, which dwelt Pleasantly on herâthen I felt The fear of crime, for well I knew Her to whose love I was untrue. She motioned at me, and that high And aweful being on my eye Flashed frowning terrorsâa frownâbut aught Of earthly anger it had notâ There was no shade in itânor less Of gloryârather, it did compress Into one self-assuming glance The rays of his whole countenance, And it was a frown of gathered light, More dreadful than the glooms of night.â Then all things fadedâ: from my soul Its pure immortal spirit stoleâ And human terrors filled my brain, And curdling ran thro' every veinâ And either the land receded fast, And shook me from its edge at last, Or some strong invisible arm Bound me in its chilly charm, And unresisting I was hurled Into a cold and darkened worldâ I stood alone in thickened gloomâ I thought it might be one spreading tomb For the whole earthâand that around, All things their sepulchre had found Under the broad vault of the sky, Which closed on them too suddenly, While yet they livedâfeeble and far, A blood-red, half distinguished star Lent sullen lightâone lurid streak Fell from it on the raven cheek Of utter darknessâand around, Terrific forms in silence frown'd, Shapeless and nameless: and to mine eye, Sometimes they rolled off cloudily, Wedding themselves with gloomâor grew Gigantic on my troubled view, And seemed to gather round me. Few And fearful were the thoughts that came Upon me in that hourâthe same Might be his thinkings who hath stood Dizzy amid the dashing flood On a poor plank, hopeless to save One breathing moment from that wave; Or, it was as if within the womb, While yet in uncreated gloom, The embryo-soul could faintly feel A little while its promised zeal, Then darkening in its own essay, Melt once again to night away!â And I looked toward that far, far light, And suddenly upon my sight It swelled and partedâand, as a spark Shook from it, but now quenched and dark, I saw a dim and dusky form, Like any our fancy's dream may warm, With life come forwardâand I thought, Far off, with clouds and gloom it fought, And traversed hills and desarts, set, Even in remotest distance yetâ But quick and dark it came, and swelled To giant sizeâand I beheld Its cloudy faceâon me it bent A look of dark and dread intentâ I strove to flee it, but my blood Curdled, and there unnerved I stood, Helpless and hopelessânearer still The giant cameâintent to kill, His cloudy arm he raised on high, And again I feebly strove to fly And backward fellâOh! then I stept On a loose rock that trembling kept Unfaithful watch o'er a gulf below Of depth unfathomedâI slideâI goâ But in my fall I madly grasp And cling to something!âand I gasp, Suspended there in sickening dread, Ruin below, and over head Darkness, and that terrific formâ My heart's blood shrinks fromâ Breathings warm Are near meâMighty God! I see, That maid so well beloved of me, In fainting weakness clinging there, Like a white mist, hung in morning air, O'er the hill's browâher only stay Is a loose ledge of rock and clay, That cannot give her restâit shakes!â It yieldsâit crumblesâha!âit breaksâ O horror, horror!âand she falls Thro' depths of darknessâand she calls On Ossian stillâher frenzied shriek Still upward thro' that gloom will break On my pierced earâagainâagainâ It thrills my heart and stabs my brain, And I am sick with fear and pain!â I failâI faint!âI sinkâI fallâ Downâdown thro' darkness rocks and all! This was my punishment. I woke, I know not how as the morning broke, And again sat under the wild wood tree, An earthly sun once more to seeâ And thro' the leaves his beamings glanced, And on the green turf gaily danced, In chequered radiance quick and fair, Like laughing eyes thro' parted hair.
