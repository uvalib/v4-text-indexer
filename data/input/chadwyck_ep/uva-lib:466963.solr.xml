      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO A FRIEND. No sycophant approaches now, With studied smiles and fawning bow, To beg, with well disguised deceit, To cast his off'ring at thy feet; And tell the world, in humble tone, He glories to be trod upon! Let those who live by lords and kings Descend to such ignoble things, And gaily grasp the glitt'ring prize Which wealth presents for pleasing lies: I envy not such bards their lays, And thou wouldst scorn the venal praise. Born to contend with adverse fate, Unaided by the rich and great; Inured to stern misfortune long, And train'd to hardship more than song; Owning a heart which ever beat Bold 'neath its independent sweat; I view with pity and despite The patron and his parasite: And hence may claim the right to stand, And place these trifles in thy hand, With such respect and love, as men May justly give and get again. If in these leaves thou canst descry Aught not unworthy of thine eye, Thy approbation and regard Will be their Author's best reward! The pictures they present have been Drawn 'mid the wilderness of men, From models which may still be seen In lonely walks through wood and glen; But never met where mawkish art Has modified the human heart! They represent a rustic race, Whose hearts are neither cold nor base; Whose mannersâneither bland nor rudeâ Are bluntly kind, and roughly good; Whose unobtrusive joys and woes The play of unpruned Nature shows. And as the best instructed ear Will list the lark's wild notes to hear, And even enjoy the wordless song, Irreg'lar though it be, and long; And as the most fastidious eyes (Though sated by the richest dyes, Which skilful art and ceaseless care, With sheltering shade and genial air, Can foster into bloom,) will turn To some lone scene by bank or burn, And gladly spend uncounted hours Gazing upon uncultured flowers: Even so thy cultivated ear These murmurings of song may hear; Even so thy tasteful eyes, perchance, O'er these poor portraitures may glance; And feel a sympathy as deep, With those who smile, and those who weep, As if the drapery they wear Had been more richly wrought and rare. They comeâunpolish'd though they beâ The messengers of love to thee: If thou canst trust their truth, and deem Their embassy of fond esteem As worthy of thy care,â'twill cheer One heart, though humble, yet sincere In its devout desire to twine Its kindest sympathies with thine. May, then, this faint memorial prove A lasting pledge of mutual love; May no contingency, till death, Dissolve or damp our plighted faith; May thou, whatever doom descend, Be still, as thou hast been, the friend Of him who rests, through good and ill, Thy humble friend and servant still. THE VOICE OF THE WIND. Voice of the wintry wind, That break'st with eddying swell, Thou art speaking to the hearts of men, If they could read thy spell. For the young thou hast a lesson, And a warning for the bold, And a long, long tale of vanish'd days, For the feeble and the old. What sayest thou to the maiden, Whose love-sick bosom sighs For the presence of a loved one, To bless her longing eyes? Thou speakest of anxieties, Of sad and wakeful thought, Of sorrows, fears, and jealousies, Oft entertain'd for nought. But she listens not thy boding: Confidingly and fond, She feels a lover's happiness, And dreams of nought beyond. She thinks! and her unconscious blush To thy warning makes reply, And a thousand thoughts she cannot speak Are gathered in her sigh. Voice of the wintry wind, That breaks with eddying swell, To the heart-sick and forsaken What truths hast thou to tell? Thou tellest that there have been smiles, And flattering words which freeze, That fall upon the trusting heart Like frost-wind on the trees: Thou tellest her of faithlessness, Of vow and promise broken; Thy biting breath recalls to her Each word, and look, and token: And to her cheek and bosom The cold blasts thou dost bring Have less of pain and bitterness Than disappointment's sting. Voice of the wintry wind! To the rich what art thou telling, While, like a baffled enemy, Thou prowl'st around their dwelling? Thou say'st, though wassail crown the board Within each lordly hallâ Though lavish comforts dwell with them, It is not so with all: That, in the gripe of Poverty, The noblest heart may pant; Disease and Death ne'er miss their aim, When their bow is strung by Want. Thou tellest of the quenched hearth, And shivering orphans there, Who vainly ring Want's faint appeal With a widow'd mother's pray'r. But when plenty fills the homes of men, They hug themselves, and think That none but evil-doers can In cold misfortune sink. Voice of the wintry wind, What sayest thou to those Who bide the ban of poverty, Amid the drifted snows;â Upon whose unprotected forms No fireside warmth is shed; Who with unceasing toil must earn Their own and children's bread? Thou tellest them of avarice Which grinds them day by day,â Of thankless masters they have served, Mean fare and niggard pay. Thou tellest them that here on earth They have few friends to save: Bidding them look for happiness And rest beyond the grave. Voice of the wintry wind, To the young what sayest thou? Thou tellest them of many things, But they will not hear thee now. Thou tellest of the spring-time gone, Of summer pass'd away; And sickly autumn sunk at last In winter's dull decay;â Of desolation's heartless rule, Stripp'd woods, and faded flowers, And birds, that mute and trembling sit In December's leafless bowers. Thou tellest them man's life is like The seasons of the year; But their hearts are all too busy now Thy friendly voice to hear. A long, dim vista opens, To each young and ardent eye; And in all the buoyancy of hope, Thy warnings they defy. Voice of the wintry wind, What sayest thou to the old? As flaggingly they onward go Amid thy freezing cold? Thou tellest them a long, sad tale, Of joys and sorrows past; Of friendships turn'd to coldness now, And loves that did not last. Thou tellest them of children gone Into the silent grave; And that they soon must follow them They could have died to save. Thou tellest them of feebleness, As thou freezest on their cheek; Of joints which stiffen in the cold, And sinews waxen weak. Thou tell'st them, and they heave a sigh, That their day of strength is o'er; That health and wealth from them are gone, And honour ever more. They listen to thy mournful tale, As thou art hurrying past, And sigh for that appointed restâ Their longest and their last. Voice of the wintry wind, What sayest thou to me, While sweeping o'er thy heedless path, By town, and tower, and tree? Thou tellest of proud fabrics By airy fancy rear'd, And phantoms in the whirling gulf Of time long disappear'd. Thou tellest that the once warm blood Of youth which bounded high, Was shed, and a more scanty stream Its place must now supply. Thou tellest to a weaken'd pulse, Which was not weak before, That its best years of life are past, And come again no more. Thou tellest to my senses, By thy keen and piercing cold, That I am young no longer, And never shall be old. Voice of the wintry wind, Which sweeps from shore to shore, I thank thee for thy warning, Though I knew the truth before. A WISH. While sages in thy senate-house Concur and disagree, My much loved country, wilt thou hear An humble wish for thee? I do not wish thee glorious In the corse-strewn fields of war, Nor do I wish thy banner flung O'er conquer'd lands afar,â Where men with scowling hatred shrink Before their fellow-men, And die, as hunted helots die, In famine's dreary den. I do not wish thee opulence Fed by oppression's gains, By treasures gather'd 'midst the groans Of slaves and clank of chains. I do not wish thy men-of-war Again to sweep the seasâ Blackening the skies with vict'ry's smoke, Borne on the peaceful breeze. For every land beneath the sun Owns the same law divine, And all their sons are brethren brave By blood and birth of thine; And the trophies which commemorate The day when mankind bleeds, Are darken'd with the dooming stain Of fratricidal deeds. But I wish thee most conspicuously With bloodless deeds to grace The glorious page of those records Which time can ne'er efface. I wish thee worthy of a name More noble than the boast Which mankind made of Macedon, When the world was won and lost. I wish thy peaceful fleets to bear Across the ocean broad, To every clime where man may breathe, The conquering Word of God. I wish Idolatry to flee Before thy vengeance fleet; And Vice and Vanity to cower, In terror at thy feet. I wish thee most triumphantly O'er earth and sea to wave The flag of Love and Liberty, Whose motto is âTo Save.â I wish the warring world afar Their swords aside to throw, And bless the battles thou hast won, Where darkness was thy foe. I wish proud cities, fenced around By superstition's towers, May hear, but not with dread, the sound Of thy advancing powers. May their batteries and their bastions fall, And their guardians back be driven; Blessing the host that breach'd their wall With promises from Heaven. And finally, my country dear, Whate'er thy doom may be, The last and most important wish My heart prefers for thee, Is that through all posterity, Thy favour'd soil may prove Prolific of immortal souls Redeem'd by Sovereign love. THE UNMARRIED WIDOW. O Grave! what wo is wrought by thee! What clouded years of misery! What loving hearts hast thou bereft! What joyless, hopeless mourners left! Mary Howitt. She was not by the bed of death To see his manly strength decay; Or mark the last convulsive breath, That feebly heaved his suffering clay. No! hands less kind, and hearts less true, Were gather'd round his dying bed, To watch death's shadows, as they grew Slowly o'er his devoted head! Yet once I saw her, with those eyes, As bending o'er his couch she stood,â With hopes, that vainly strove to rise, With fears, that curdled cold her blood. Of these I saw the shadows pass Across her eye, along her brow, Like things seen in a magic glassâ Alas! methinks I see them now! Yet once again I saw her near, Ere the black coffin lid was closed; Even then, her dark eye shed no tear O'er his cold limbs in death composed. And yetâOh! what a spectre host That sight must wake within her brain! Of every parted look, the ghost! Of every perish'd smile, the pain! There, visions of that happy time When hearts, whose faith had long been tried, And made but one responsive chime, In wedlock's bands of love are tied: There, the concentred wish of yearsâ The long, long cherish'd dream of loveâ The source of countless hopes and fears, Lay with the winding-sheet above! The houseâthe homeâthe happy hearthâ A husband's smile, and children's gleeâ Their harmless sport, and noisy mirth, And the embrace, caressingly, Of him she loved, when eventide, Which homeward brings the laden bee, Should bring that loved one to her side, Her heart from every care to free. His hand to pressâhis eye to meetâ His frugal meal to dress with care; To hear him talk in accents sweetâ In all his joys and woes to share: These were her fancy's golden mineâ These were her richesâthese her store; Her heart a consecrated shrine, With all its treasures brimming o'er! These to her soul's enchanted cell, At morn, or noon, or evening time, Had comeâlike spirits bright that dwell In worlds beyond the reach of crimeâ To steal her from herself away, A new and happy world revealing, Where Love ruled every smiling day, In the unbounded flow of feeling. That light was quench'd, that music hush'd, In silence and in hopeless gloom; Her visions in that hour had rush'd All downward to their silent tomb. With his cold shrouded corse they lay, From whom they came, on whom they turn'dâ All perish'dâcold and pass'd away, Like dust which hath been long inurn'd. But though her dark eye did not swerve, As there she gazed upon the dead, Yet, in the trembling of each nerve, The anguish of her heart I read. The shudder, that so quickly flies Electric o'er each arm and limb, Speaks a far deeper grief than eyes Which many tears have render'd dim. With wayward footsteps, moving slow, And eyes upon the cold earth fix'd, As she from thence essay'd to go, All faint and pale, I saw her next: Pale were her lips, so lately red; Her cheek had sadly changed its hue,â The sparkle from her eye had fled, And on her brow deep shadows grew. A love-lorn, hope-forsaken shade, She glided through the twilight's gloom, As if full fain she would have made Her nearest resting-place the tomb,â With him to moulder side by side In the cold chambers of the dead, Who sought in her a living bride, And share in death his bridal bed. Ay, she hath loved, ill-fated maid, As she can never love again, Though her last hour be long delay'd, And from his prey Death long refrain: Her heart hath pour'd forth all its ruth, And pour'd it forth, alas, in vain! The faith of age, the love of youth, And ashes in their place remain. A VISION OF DEATH. PART FIRST. Amid the weakness of disease, and darkness of the night, A form of awful majesty rose on my fever'd sight; 'Twas indistinct, but terrible, and of gigantic size, Appalling to all human hearts, and to all human eyes. And by his gaunt and grisly mould, and from his noisome breath, I knew by intuition dread the phantom's name was Death; Deep groans were rising round him, and tears were falling fast, And quivering lips were uttering sad sobs which were their last. And round about the phantom flung his bare and bony head, And a sneer was on his bloodless lip, as he bent him o'er the dead; And deadlier than the basilisk's was his destroying glance, Which flash'd and flash'd in restless wrath a thousand ways at once. And wheresoe'er the venom fell from his infernal eye, The young, the strong, the beautiful, at once dropp'd down to die, And a voice of lamentation rose amid the dreary gloom, A long low melancholy wail for man's predestined doom. But it touch'd no chord of sympathy in the Phantom-king of fear, Who firmer clench'd his bony hand, and closed his ruthless ear; And my fainting heart began to fail with horror and dismay, To see the fearful ravages of that grim spectre's sway. But, lo! before the phantom's face appear'd a lovely Child, And songs of joy and jubilee rose round him as he smiled; I heard the pÃ¦an of the blest, and with them tried to sing, (While the King of Terrors writhed and reel'd,) âO Death, where is thy sting?â And my heart-strings ceased to vibrate, and my sinews ceased to shake, For he had grown a trembler who had made the boldest quake; With every glance the Infant cast, and every word he spoke, The mighty shadow shook and shrank, as from the lightning's stroke: Then heaven resounded with the name of Him who conquer'd Death, And lowlier lips repeated it, in feebler tones, beneath; For the trembling multitude around in joy began to sing, âO Grave, where is thy victory now? and where, O Death, thy sting?â PART SECOND. My varying dream assumed a change. In the vision's shadowy light, The grisly Phantom-king appear'd less awful to the sight; His gorgon head was humbly bow'd, and his eyes of withering ire, That roll'd and roll'd continually, seem'd reft of half their fire. The Infant who subdued his power had grown to man's estate, Yet no rich host of worshippers round him were seen to wait; A few poor fishermen alone had left the stormy sea, In homeless want to follow himâno nobler court had he. I saw a Fiend amid the crowd concocting hellish arts, And he was busy with his task, corrupting human hearts; And through the multitude of men, with horror I could hear Rebellious whispers circulate, with words of death and fear. For they seem'd plotting to destroy that Holy One who shook The fatal reign of the Phantom-king, who trembled at his look; And I saw a faithless follower betray with a demon kiss, To the cruel hands of bloody foes, the Prince of Peace and Bliss. I saw him scourged and buffeted, and spit upon in scorn, In mockery clothed with regal robes, and crown'd with wreathed thorn,â I saw him to destruction led, and heard his fainting call, As he bow'd his headââ'Tis finishedââand darkness mantled all. PART THIRD. My spirit, for a moment sunk in the stupor of despair, Again awoke to consciousness, and the Phantom-king was there; But the scene of vision had been changed to a solitary place, Where the Holy Dead was sepultured, with a shroud upon his face. It was a cavern in the rock, whose narrow door was barr'd By a mighty stone which cover'd it, and watch'd by a Roman guard; And the King of Terrors o'er that tomb in shadowy triumph hung, And his horrid eye a haughtier flash of fateful fury flung. But I heard a shout of joy above: an angel from the sky Came down, and the stone roll'd back amain from the glance of his heavenly eye; And the Holy Dead arose to life, with smile of triumph sweet, And the Phantom-king fell prostrate and powerless at his feet. And I heard the angelic host again with joy begin to sing, âO Grave, where is thy victory now? and where, O Death, thy sting?â And I strove to imitate their lays, and utter the words they spoke, But my tuneless voice jarr'd gratingly, and the joyful vision broke. LINES WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF LEAVING EARLY HAUNTS. Ye scenes where from childhood to manhood I grew, I snatch a brief moment to bid you adieu; The days of my sojourn are number'd and o'er, And the places which knew me shall know me no more. The stream by whose margin in boyhood I play'd; The hill where unheeded in summer I stray'd; The loch in whose bosom, in frolicsome glee, I dived like a water-fowl fearless and free; The moss-cover'd bank, with pale daisies entwined, Where from day-dawn to sunset I listless reclined, With no care save a cow that I kept from the grain, And a spirit as blyth as the lark's matin strain: Ye scenes of the past, which in vain I recallâ Loch, mountain, and streamletâfarewell to you all. Ye loved early haunts, where I once fondly cherish'd The day-dreams of Fancy with youth that have perish'd: Ye woods, still alive with the murmur of bees, Where I listen'd entranced the wild wail of the breeze; Where, before the red sun the rich landscape forsook, And all Nature the calm of a Sabbath partook, I wander'd along in contemplative mood, And companionship found in the still solitude; And the path, so familiar, I threaded at night, Though the stars, hid in storms, bestow'd not their light: Ye walks, and ye woods, with your green leafy pall, And thou footpath so shady,âfarewell to you all! The woods in rich verdure the summer shall dress, And light footsteps be heard in the shady recess, And hearts full of hope in the solitude muse, When the evening shadows their coolness diffuse; And while impulse and feeling by youth is imbued, The thoughts which were mine may in them be renew'd, And the sun shall set red, and the summer wind sigh, When in lowly communion with reptiles I lieâ When the words which I speak, and the name that I own, Have perish'd from earth, and no longer are known. And thou, little garden, where erst I had toil'd To reclaim and make fertile what once was a wild; Where each shrub, and each flower, on my heart had a hold, For I nursed them when young, and I loved them when old; And the favourite plot, which, at eve's leisure hours, I strove to enrich with the pleasantest flowers; Where beneath the green sheltering bower I had rear'd, The tall tiger-lily and moss-rose appear'd; And primroses, pinks, and narcissuses bloom'd, And the wall-flower the soft summer breezes perfumed; Where the crocus peep'd forth from its cold snowy bed, And the delicate snow-drop uplifted its head. For me now no more shall your blossoms expand, And another shall tend you with negligent hand, Whenâa stranger 'mong strangersâlike you, I decay, Or, unknown and forgotten, lie cold in the clay. And last of the objects from which I must part, Is the low dingy cottageâthe home of my heart; Where a fond mother's tenderness brighten'd life's page, And the locks of a father were whiten'd by age. Where the prayer, which a parent had taught me to pray, Was duly repeated with each closing day; Where my heart wont to thrill with the freshness of feeling Ere experience the glow from its core had been stealing. And there, too, with strength and with spirits subdued, When rest was a stranger that dared not intrude; When weakness and pain had forbid me to steep My limbs in the balmy refreshment of sleep; When the stream of existence ran stagnant and slow; With temples that ached, and a pulse beating low; By the scarce glowing embers and rush taper's light I outwatch'd the long hours of the dark winter night, And suppress'd the low moan which was rising profound, Lest the noise should disturb the tired sleepers around. Let grandeur be proud of his lofty-built halls, His carpeted floors, and his picture-clad walls: Though rudely constructed, and humble, in sooth, Far dearer to me was the home of my youth,â Where the shadowy walls look'd like winter in June, And the small smoky windows made twilight at noon; Where the snow drifted in at the old crazy door, And the rain-drops in winter made pools on the floor. Though we part, and though others must tenant you now, To the mandate of Fate like the bulrush I bow; The things which, wherever my footsteps might roam, Still lived in my heart with the image of home, How I loved yeâthe pangs of this moment may tell, As the sad words I utterâfor ever farewell! SONNETS. I. 'Tis night! and the long radiance of the west, Which floated from the cloud-empurpled hill, Hath faded into darknessâall is still; The winds are hush'd, and nature is at rest. The wild deeds of the day no more infest Those who may still be watchful. In high heaven An open volume liesâto mortals given, That they may read the record therein traced: Those glorious characters of light, engraved On that far-circling dome, high-roof'd and fairâ The glowing gems, with which heaven's floor is pavedâ The hand-writ of Jehovah, shining there,â All point us to the throne of Him who saved! How fit this solemn hourâhow form'd for prayer! II. The day was dark and stormy; but the night Dawns into brightness, and the silvery moon Pours over sea and land her urn of light, Making of midnight a most pleasant noon. The autumn blasts were withering, and their blight Brought desolation: but a richer boon The balmy showers and breathing zephyrs bring; And the cold earth, fann'd by the breath of spring, Again shall start into luxuriant life. Deformity and beautyâstorm and calmâ The day-dawn and the darknessâquiet and qualmâ Throughout all Nature, mix and mingle, rife: Then, why should man expect a fixed state, Where all is changeâor shrink beneath his fate? AN INFANT'S DEATHBED. With piety beyond her years, In patient pain she lay, And, as she mark'd her mother's tears, Entreated her to pray; For she, poor sufferer, had been taught, E'en ere her tongue could tell The language of her own sweet thought, How our first parents fell. And she had heard of Sin and Death, Had heard of Hell and Heaven, And knew that mortal guilt through faith Alone can be forgiven; And therefore did her dying eye Demand a mother's care, And her dying lips imploringly Prompt her sad soul to prayer. âPray for me, motherâmother, pray!â Was her last faint request, Ere her young spirit burst away To the land of joy and rest. Why should that parent grieve in vain To see her breathe her last, Since her short pilgrimage of pain So swiftly, sweetly pass'd? She grievesâyet placid is the tear That lifeless form which steeps; Her spirit broods o'er that lone bier, Rejoicing as she weeps. She weeps above her faded rose, Untimely cropp'd by Death; But the font that flows o'er its repose Hath been refill'd by faith. And she would rather linger there, And weep with humbled pride, Than with the gay their glory share, Or smile o'er aught beside. Of such as she whose eyes are closed In deep and dreamless rest, Redeeming mercy hath composed The kingdom of the blest. And she shall need no fostering hand, Nor faithful mother's care, To tend her in that holy land, For all are happy there. Such is the joyful hope which fills That parent's eye with light, Even through the tear which love distils On her dear infant's flight. THE END.</field>
